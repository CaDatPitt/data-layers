Z BT attempts to end hazing by ending pledging 

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staff Writer
This will be the last class of
pledges for Pitt's Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity, following a meeting of
the National Chapter where haz-
ing was cited as the primary rea-
son for a move to end pledging.
”There’s a lot of people
throughout the chapters who
really don't like the idea of haz-
ing at all,” said Shawn Groff,‘
President of Pitt's ZBT chapter.
'5 The idea of abolishing pledging
in ZBT fraternities all over the na-
tion resulted from the many inju-
ries and even deaths that hazing
has caused.

Hazing can be defined as any
action which engangers the men—.
tal or physical health or safety of
a student or, which willfully des-
troys or removes public or private
property for initiation purposes or
admission into an affiliation.

In other words hazing may in-
clude, among other things, phys-
ical brutality (whipping,
branding), forced consumption of
food or liquor, and in general,
any activity which subjects an in-
dividual to extreme physical
and/or mental stress.

Pitt employs an antihazing poli-
cy which ”prohibits any form of
hazing as a precondition for

membership or as a condition for
continuation of membership in
any certified student organi-
zation.”

The recent act means going
from a terminal pledging period
to initiation only a few weeks af-
ter rush is over.

”I don't have all the answers,”

‘said Groff. ”It’s tough to run a

pledging program though be-
cause there have been so many
bad incidents. Eliminating pledg-
ing hopefully will eliminate

' hazing.”

The fraternity feels that good
rushing techniques are the key to
quality membership rather than

pledging programs.

Rush will most likely be more
selective, involving ”tougher
standards" for rushees to adhere
to. It is felt that not enough stu-
dents are active after becoming
brothers.

Said Groff, ”Before you had
separation. There [were] always
brothers and pledges. Now, it
will be all brothers and every-
body is going to have to par-
ticipate."

The National Supreme Council
of ZBT is discussing the im-
plementation of a four year
loyalty oath.

Students receive free health screening

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

Health-conscious students had

fbja chance for a free checkup at a

Student Health Service screening
in Forbes Clinic yesterday.

Tests for blood pressure,
cholesterol levels .and body fat
percentages were among the
services’ offered at the health
screening.

The program was started be-
cause ”a lot of students are be-
coming increasingly aware of

‘ their health and well-being/"said
health educator Shirley Haber-
man. ”And we want to be

responsive to students’ n,eeds.”'f D
1— T;he''hea'lthscreening clinic Isa‘

new program that will be open to
students every other Wednesday
through March 29. Students can

come in and be examined in the .

testing areas that are set up in the
clinic..

First, a student's height, weight
and blood pressure are meas-
ured. Then, a small blood sample
is taken for cholesterol testing.
Results of this test can be ob-
tained two weeks later at the next
session. '

According to Haberman, if a
student's cholesterol is borderline
to high, he can come back for ad-
ditional testing. She also recom-
mends less fat in the diet to bring

y__down a highjcholesterol level. _.

”This was a popular test at the
health fair. If someone’s athletic,
they can see their lean body mass
to see any progress they've
made," Haberman said.

If someone is found to have a
high fat percentage, Haberman
recommended that he see the
dietician at Forbes Clinic and that
he start an exercise program.

’’I’d recommend starting off
nice and easy, just making one or
two gradual changes,” she said.
”Once you have some success,
you can make more changes.”

are brochures on how togquit

man said.

Student attendance at the
health screening was ‘high.

One Pitt junior said, ”I came
because I want to get in better
shape, and I want to see how far
I have to go to get fit.”

Pitt senior Mary Pirt said, ’’I

than them have to ”prove them-

ZBT is about.

It is increasingly becoming .

more difficult for fraternities to

receive liability insurance. It is 

either not available, too expen-

Black detainees stage hunger strike in S. Africa

JOHANNESBURC, South Afri-
ca (AP) —- A government minister
met Tuesday with lawyers and
parents of some of the nearly 300
black detainees who have vowed
to starve themselves to death un-
less they are freed or charged
with a crime.

In support of the hunger strik-
ers, Anglican Archbishop Des-
mond Tutu called on Anglicans
to fast each Monday, Wednesday
and Friday.

After a two—hour evening meet-
ing with Adriaan Vlok, minister of
law and order, one member of
the six-parent delegation, Wal-
lace Motsetsi, said he felt there
was ”a ray of hope.” But delegate
Willie Bokala said the meeting
”achieved nothing.”

Bokala said he was guardian of
Clive Radebe, 25, who he said
has been in detention since

November 1987 and entered his

21st day of a hunger strike
Tuesday.

”We are faced with the difficult
situation that children may die in
detention,” Bokala said before
the meeting.

Lt. Peet Bothma, spokesman for
Vlok, said detainees are reviewed
and released every day, and 17
were freed Tuesday.

But he warned it was danger-
ous to free detainees who were
on hunger strike ”because they
might go out and fill themselves
up and they could die.”

He said two were freed Mon-
day, two days after they started
eating again. He said they were
not released because they broke
their fast, but because of the regu-
lar review of detainees.

Gunman opens fire

BETHESDA, Md. (AP) ~ A gun-
man opened fire in an office
building yesterday, killing three
people and wounding one before
killing himself, Montgomery
County police said.

Police Capt. Richard Williams
said the man emerged from an

killing three people, he turned his
gun on himself, Williams said.

The shootings occurred at the
credit card departmentoffices of
Chevy Chase Federal Savings
Bank in this Washington, D.C.,
suburb. .

The gunman appeared to be a
’’disgruntled employee,” accord-

Khomeini’s behavior
merits strong action

A man named Salman Rushdie wrote a book, not very long ago.

It was entitled The Satanic Verses, and it was a novel dealing
with issues relating to Moslem fundamentalists. In reaction to this
book, the Ayatollah Khomeini Tuesday ordered all ”brave Mos-
lems” to seek out and kill Rushdie and the publishers of his book.
Yesterday, a senior Iranian cleric set a $2.6 million bounty on the
man's head.

The question ”What is wrong with this picture?” yields an in-
credible mass of answers.

I Aside from the horror of religious intolerance and the frighten-
ing echoes of George Orvve|l’s ”thought police” (as Rushdie refers
to the situation), there is an even more important consideration
that looms over the whole situation.

How can the governments of the world allow a man to remain
in power who, with a fanatical disregard for other nations’ bord-

ers and laws (Rushdie currently lives in Great Britain), orders the ,

execution of a man because of something that he wrote?

The book was written and initially published in Great Britain.
There is no realistic basis on which Khomeini could even be re-
motely considered to have any jurisdiction over Rushdie, what-
soever. For a government’ leader to order the execution of a citizen
and a resident of another country is an act of such presumption,
and such an abuse of religious and political power, that it merits
some sort of corrective action.

Ever since the American hostage crisis, Iran. has walked the very
dangerous line that separates political conflict from military en-
gagement. Someday, Khomeini’s Iran is going to overstep the
boundaries. And with the immature and belligerent attitudes that
this leader has held and demonstrated concerning the value of in-
dividual lives and the reality of the world's political variance, his
eventual, presumably forcible, removal from power will be a very,
very good thing for the world.

Establishing ethical
code is not effective

The University of Florida has appointed a Morals Task Force for
each of its branch campuses, each of which will then develop an
ethical code to submit to the university's Board of Regents. There

has also been a. suggestion by Student Body President Scooter Wi|- _

lis that it establish a mandatory freshman morals course.
Attempts to regulate student morality achieve one of two things.

Either they are completely ineffective, or they turn the university Id

into a private conformist club.

For private and/or parochial universities, the establishment of
a mandatory code of behavior is, if not desirable, at least permis-
sible. They are private and therefore have the right to regulate
members as they choose, within the bounds of the law.

UF is a state school, however, and it realizes the implications
of this. The university is not in a position to regulate students’ be-
havior, and it is not attempting to. What it hopes to achieve with
the ethics code is to establish guidelines for behavior, and this puts
the university firmly into the category of ineffectual moralizers.

There are valid problems that need to be dealt with, but there
are better ways of doing so. Public education, with programs like
the Interfraternity Council's Our Choice program, is one way to
raise consciousness. And the effective enforcement of laws is
another, perhaps by coordinating administration and student or-
ganizations with local campus police forces. The University of
Florida would be well advised to follow these avenues, rather than

   

attempt to implementa placebo solution such as an non-mandatory T
ethical code. ' - I . V , I _ : .~ .  ~

0 Did you ever try reading The

having a little problem with sa-
tanic messages for a while, so we
hired a Monsignor Staff Writer to
exorcise the paper. Unfortunate-
ly, he was discovered to be a god-
less heathen.

0 After watching The Sound of
Music 274 times, I noticed some-
thing disturbing. The film turns a

delightfully adorable love affair _

between two innocent, crazy kids
into the most horrible romantic
tragedy I've ever seen. Liesel and
Rolf dance around the gazebo,
jovially singing about their love
and their ages in one scene.
Then, a few scenes down- the
garden path, Rolf returns in an SS
uniform to inform Liesel that he's
had a slight change of heart.
Now, I've witnessed more than
my fair share of rejections in my
time, but I've seen none so heart-
wrenching as, ”You’re not Aryan
enough for me, babe. Hit the
road.”

Feminists from Hell fight back

Editor's Note: This letter is in
response to Vince Carey's
column, ”Marching to the tune of
swimsuits,” from the Feb. 7 issue
of The Pitt News.

The Feminists from Hell are
pleased to announce that you

have been unanimously selected
to be the Pittsburgh poster boy for
the 1989 Crusade Against Small
and Simple Minds. We feelthat
l1f;,olm,;among other prospective
candidates, your editorial best
reflected the depth and sensitivi-
ty that we have come to expect
from the male columnists fea-
tured in The Pitt News. Once
again, we have an editorial not
about the real issue, i.e., the role
of the media in perpetuating the
depersonalization of women, but
rather, one more personal opin-
ion devoid of substance. Reach-
ing new lows in ignorance and
insults, you have provided great
insight into the workings of the
normal male mind (most of

which seems to occur below the I

waist.) T

Carey: stop looking at women
and start talking to them.

On the other hand...

I am writing i_n regards to your
article ”Marching to the tune of
swimsuits,” [Feb. 7]. I very much
agree with your opinions regard-
ing the publication of the maga-
zine. [As] for women despising it,
I think they're crazy. From a
woman's point of view, if I had
the opportunity to pose in any
one of those bathing suits, I'd do
it in a second. (And I'm sure I'm
not the‘ only one.) All inall, the
main comment I wanted to make
was in reference to "this all” be-
ing a sport. Well, yes, swimming
is a sport, and I agree girl- _
watching is also a sport, but what
about the women? When we go
to the beach, do you think all we

The plight of the impoverished...

After reading ’’Poverty —- not 

easy to understand” Dan. 30] in
The Pitt News, I want to thank
Caroline Reich for her honesty
and courage in admitting how lit-
tle she could relate to those in
poverty. I think she speaks for.
most people who are ashamed to
admit they don't know what it
feels like to really be in need [of]
the basic essentials of life. Unfor-
tunately, unlike Caroline, others,

have a tendency out of their
unknown guilt to blame them for '
their own circumstances. To justi- -
fy their guilt, they call the poor
lazy, unambitious, irresponsible,
mental cases, and would like
them  gathered in a ghetto
someplace where they would not
have to see them. Witnessing the

lives of the poor around them . .~

Thursday, February l6, I989

Authority figures should not be followed merely on faith

They may tell us to take off our
clothes, work day and night, or
confess our sins; we will listen
and obey. We assume they know
what's best for us. At least, they
appear to know.

They are our figures of authori-
ty, and they define themselves by
name of doctor, teacher, officer,
or clergyman. Physically and
mentally, they are no different
from the rest of us. They must eat,
sleep and seek companionship.
However, their functions are too
important to go unnoticed.

If they are to have the power to
lead us, we must know who they
are. Therefore, they set them-
selves apart from us by way of
their white coats, badges, uni-
forms and suits.

‘ As we grow older and become
more accustomed to what they
represent, we require little be-
yond the sight of their uniform to
make us accept their words and
actions as legitimate and respon-
sible. They may be strangers to
us, but nonetheless, we see them

Most people who think with
their hearts and not with their
brains will tend to think that wel-
fare is actually helpingspeople
out. The question is: Is it really
helping them,’ or is it keeping
them down?

as part of an authoritative image
which we respect. Unfortunately,
images can be deceptive.

the driveway, and then went si-
lent and dark in the night.
I used to think about that night
fairly often. It was our first night
‘ in the small town where I spent
six years of my life. Malone is the
name of that town. The main
street was small and littered with
all of thetypical attractions that
you would expect: a newsstand,
a general store, two hardware
stores and a garage, of sorts. It
was actually an automotive parts
store, but the owner, George,
would occasionally take the car
of someone he knew to the old
farm where he lived and work on
it. And of course, in Malone,
everyone knew each other.
George did good business.
George had a son, Curt. He
was the youngest of four chil-
dren, and he was somewhat less
than planned for. He was born
more than seven years after his
other siblings. '
By the ‘time Curt reached the

Our images of authority are
based on principles of equality,
justice and knowledge, to benefit
all. However, it is this ideal
which is often corrupted by the
actions of an individual whose
behavior contradicts the stan-
dards associated with the image.

For example, the sexual harass-

ment of students by their instruc-
tors has only recently begun to be
investigated by several universi-
ties. One reason for the lack of at-
tention that this problem has
received is that many students fail
to come forward to report such
incidents.

Nancy Wahlig, a coordinator
for the Student Safety Awareness
Program at the University of
California, reported that sexual
harassment ”often results in stu-
dents leaving school, failing ex-
ams - and feeling anxiety and
confusion.” These problems arise
when those we consider author-
itative behave in a manner for-
eign to the image we expect them
to maintain.

Other recently documented in-
cidents of image perversion in-
clude priests molesting altar boys,
doctors drugging and raping pa-
tients, and the sexual abuse of
nursery school students by their
teachers. In all instances, the vic-
tims failed to immediately report
the crime due to the controlling

nature of the images of the peo-
ple who abused them and the na-
ture of the abuse.

In addition to cases of sexual
abuse by our most prominent
authority images, widespread in-
cidents of child abuse, kept hid-
den because of the strength of
parental authority, pose a serious
threat to the image of the family.
Such activity tends to be buried
under a domestic classification.

We tend to overlook cases of
this kind as being isolated inci-
dents. However, regardless of
how unsettling it can be, crimi-
nal activity involving an image of
authority poses a serious problem
for us all.

Authority draws its power from
our submission to it. Although we
consider ourselves free, we are
still controlled by our obedience
to the images which our authori-
ty figures utilize. We tend to slow
our cars down at the sight of the
police, and bow our heads when
we pass a nun. We fail to ques-
tion our behavior toward these

figures; we fear them and con-
form with society to obey.
Since it is not possible to live
in a chaotic world of anarchy, we
need authority and leadership to
survive. But, must we follow
these images blindly like robots?

If we are to modify our be-
havior in the presence of authori-
ty figures, we should do so on the
basis of their actual individual
function, not the ideal image we
perceive.

We must" not consider those
who hold authority to be as pure

as the images they present. They .

are indeed human, and as flawed
as we are. If we continue to be
submissive purely on the basis of
what they represent, we allow
ourselves to be vulnerable to
their mistakes. -

chief of The Pitt News.

For Reality — Is welfare really worthwhile?

ment money pours out to-the
”less fortunate” in return for their
votes in the next election. A cyni-
cal view, but an accurate one.

The question is, who are the
people on welfare? Well, the ob-
vious answer is those people who
are unable to work for some rea-
son or another, and those Who do

not earn enough money to keep ‘

themselves above the poverty
level. There are over a thousand
pages worth of material detailing
various standards for welfare
eligibility, so it's easy to see how
large the demographics would be
on what kind of people are wel-
fare junkies. This does not in-
clude, however, those people
who are either physically or men-

tally incapable of working, just

those who are lazy.

Welfare junkies have easy
lives. They can sit around in their
homes all day and watch TV,
listen to the radio or whatever

age when he wanted the atten-
tion of his brothers and sisters, it
was a little late. The two oldest
had moved out of housetand
town by the time he was 9 years
old. Christy won a scholarship to
a local Catholic girls’ boarding
school, and was therefore gone
for most of the fall and winter.
She left for the school on the day
after his 12th birthday.

School was not much of a so-

else possesses them (even work
at a part—time job, just so long as
it doesn't bring in enough money
to lessen the welfare award), all
safe and secure in the fact that the
government will be sending them
money to stay alive.

A prime argument used by wel-
fare junkies and welfare pushers
is_ that the recipients of taxpayers’
money aren't able to get jobs that
would support them (and/or their
families), so they are forced to
stay on the government payroll.
This essentially means that a per-
sononwelfare wouldn't be able
to keep his cable TV, rent VCR
tapes and buy all the other non-
essential things in life. A person
would, of course, be able to buy
enough food to live on.

The key to not being on welfare
is, naturally, to live within one’s
means. An example of this would
be families on welfare practicing
birth control, thus limiting the

cial occasion for us. We went, we
sat in avery small classroom for
seven hours, and then we left.
So Curt ended up/spending a
great deal of his time alone. Isaw

‘bike through town, never stop-

ping, just passing through. He al-
ways craned his head as he went

someone. But I never knew‘ of
anyone he would be looking for.
In my small circle of friends, there
was not one of us who really

knew anything about Curt. Most "

of what I knew came from my
mother's gossip. He was just a
face, but among such a small
number of faces, he was a
familiar one.

My only personal experience
with Curt took place one day
when my father and I were at
George's store. My father went to
buy something for the car, and I
was playing on some boxes that
were stacked in the back of the
place.

 

number of mouths to feed. Of
course, the more children .a wel-
fare family has, the more govern-
ment cash it receives.

Welfare junkies, however,
don't want to give up the life of
"luxury” theyalready have. Why
give up the free money and spare
time to slave away at some
subsistence—level job? Why be-
come a respectable, tax-paying
citizen when one can be a tax-
receiving layabout? '

The reason, of course, is fear of
living below the ”poverty level.”
In America, some 13 percent of
the people are under this imagi-
nary line, a place that conjures up
images of destitute men and
women wearing their grand-
father's old clothing and eating
rotten potatoes. This poverty-
level talk, however, is bunk.

A simple fact that has been
proved and publicized many
times, but is usually ignored, is

‘Curt came in through the back
door and went into the office
where my dad and George were
talking. George and Curt came
out a ‘few rninutes later. There

was a brief exchange between ‘_

them in furious whispers, and
then suddenly, George pulled his
arm back and hit Curt hard.

Curt fell down,. and‘ some,

blood came from his mouth. He
got back up slowly and awkward-
ly and walked out without look-
ing back. George stood there for
a moment, and I was terrified that
he might see me, crouched,
frozen, on top of a box in the
corner. ‘ ’

But he didn't. He went back
into the office, and shut the door.

I was 8 years old when this
happened. Curt was 13.

Later, when |‘asked my father
why George had done that, the
only thing he would say was that
George had some problems.

But that didn't make it all_ right.

I left Malone two years later;

my father got a job in Pittsburgh. '

 

 

this: An American has less than
a I percent chance of staying be-
low the poverty level if he does
the following three things:

I) Completes high school.

2) Stays at the same job for
more than a year, even if it is a
minimum-wage job.

3) Gets and stays married.

So the question still remains,
why are thereso many welfare
junkies? There can be no other

answer than that they are merely ‘

lazy, content to live off the taxes
of honest citizens for an easy life
of TV and Oreo cookies.

will be faced with the task of hav-
ing to be more creative in their
recruiting practices without hav-
ing pledging.

For instance, the fact that Pitt
has recently implemented a ”dry
rush” policy has led to more
thought out activities during the
rush period.

’’I think it's something we have
to do from a legal, moral and lia-
bility standpoint,” said Groff. ,

Although pledging did not be-

gin as early as the fratemity, it has
become a norm, and the recent
change will be hard for ZBT to
accept

”lt’s hard to envision it until it
actually happens. There have
been twenty six years of tradition
and a lot of it has been good,”
Groff said.

Normally, brothers learn the
fraternity history during the
pledge period, but now a mem-
bership education program will

be implemented.

For instance, the Judicial
Board.

”|nstead of being there just to

- be there,” said Groff, ”a stan-

dards board will review all
brothers at Pitt's ZBT monthly.”

The idea again of the four year
oath is that if someone does not
live up to certain educational,
moral and ethical expectations,
they should be expelled from the
fraternity.

The biggest problem right now
seems to be that people are not
sure how well the idea will work.

”We’re gonna have to follow
their [the National chapter] guide-
lines. We have no choice,”said
Groff. ”That’s part of being in a
national fraternity.”

There are a few chapters which
are already implementing the
new action this term on a trial ba-
sis to see how it will work.

Pitt's ZBT has decided to wait,_

giving them more time to" work

things out.

Brothers at Pitt are presently
working to devise alternate pro-
grams to pledging and are busy
coming up with new ideas.

”|t’s good because we're lead-
ing the way. You're gonna see it
in many other fraternities too. It's
just a matter of time,” Groff said.

”All eyes are going to be on us
next year,” he added.

1 lifewas’ fair,’

By Joel Timulak

Showcase Editor

An interviewer once asked Kurt
Vonnegut Jr. if he had any advice
for young writers. Vonnegut said
no. '

Dressed in a grey suit and peer-
ing above half-glasses, that same
black-comic writer warmly ad-
vised a sell-out crowd last night
at Carnegie Music Hall who ap-
plauded each of his characteris-
tic paradoxes and witticisms.

Acting as a psychic, Vonnegut
edited the manuscripts of all
those who raised their hands say-
ing that they were currently hav-
ing trouble with a story.

”Throw away the first four
pages, I don't care what they
are.” He continued, ”You’re
missing a character...”

In his novels, Vonnegut tells

the most outlandish tales which

somehow conclude with an an-
swer to absurdity. His advice to
writers, however, reeked of com-
mon sense: "You must have
something you want to say to be
a writer.” Hardly something one
would expect to hear from the
creator of ”time—tripping” and
”granfalloons.”

Missing in the lecture, in-
troduced by the ubiquitous Jay

Katz, was Vonnegut’s outrageous »

remedies and schemes so promi-
nent in his works. As if he'd sud-

denly taken a dose of health and .

sanity, Vonnegut advised, ”Join
the ACLU.” _

Closing the lecture with his
trademark chalkboard diagram,
Vonnegut described the shapes of

famous formulas of literature on »

a graph and for a brief moment
the classic Vonnegut was in view.

Speaking of his experience as
an anthropology grad-student
reading native stories ’’I couldn't
stand the primitive people be-

A cause they are too stupid. Their

stories are dead-level: you never
know what's the good news and
what's the bad news.”

He went on to show how ”the
greatest work of writing in the En-
glish language,” Hamlet has the
same straight-I i ne graph as those
stories and that ”the best works
of literature tell us something true
about life,”

”We, as 20th century Ameri-

cans, have heard too many stories, , A

and have cofused what is.5tory.

and what is Iife.”
’’In the after-life,” that he

doesn't believe in, he said, ” I,

would like to find someone who
can tell me what was the good
news and what was the bad
news.” .

Nonetheless, to other conclu-
sions as drab as, ’_’whoever said

 

’ the crowd roared.

sHOWCASEpROFlLE: WYEP has something for everyone «-

By Linda Ryan
For The Pitt News

It's Festival Month at WYEP.
During the month of February,
WYEP (91.3 FM) will be airing
concerts recorded live from vari-
ous folk festivals, including the
Smoky City Folk Festival held

‘right here in Pittsburgh every

summer.

The concert scheduled to air on
Monday, Feb. 27 (dubbed ”Big
Bad Blue Monday”) will feature
local bands such as Room To
Move, the Zipper City Blues
Band, Ernie Hawkins, Blues Or-
phans and Tempo Tantrum.

Another area group, Get Out
And Push, will be the featured
band on Feb. 20.

Three popular folk groups from
Canada will be headlining other
concert dates as well. Rare Air, a
bagpipe band from Toronto, will
be playing on Feb. 17, and on
Feb. 21 a concert featuring Spirit
of the West and the Chenille Sis-
ters will be aired.

Listeners don’t have to wait for
concert specials to hear folk mus-
ic, however. Folk music is fea-
tured every weekday from 10
a.m. until 2 p.m. on American
Sampler. Authentic American
bluegrass is also played regular-

ly every Saturday afternoon.

WYEP is primarily an all-
volunteer station with a care
professional staff nestled in the
basement of Falk Hall on the
Chatham College campus. It
returned to the air in September
of 1987 after having been off for
nearly two years.

The relationship between
WYEP and Chatham'College is
strictly that of a tenant to a land-
lord. All funding comes from the
listeners. The station's format and
parameters regarding each show
are decided in advance, but the
music played is at the discretion
of the individual DJ. All of the DJs

invite requests and comments.

Station manager Michael Ell-
cessor explains the philosophy
behind a listener-supported radio
station: ”WYEP is completely in-
dependent. Fundraisers are
designed to be non—intrusive. This
has worked out very well. Cur-
rently, WYEP is operating in the
black._’’

A ”non—intrusive” fundraiser
means that listeners are never
subjected to pledge drives that in-
terrupt the regularly-scheduled
programming.

Ellcessor adds that listener-
supported means that the au-
dience's tastes are considered

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February l6, T989

Staff Writer I

Just when you thought fly
vomit was out of fashion, Holly-
wood producers felt compelled
to treat us to some sci—fi, seque-
listic dribble — ladies and germs,
I give you The Fly ll.

Unlike its predecessors,
however, it leaves m.uch to be
desired. This graphic, repulsive,
and otherwise tasteless film fea-
tures the directoral debut of
special—effects wiz, Chris Walas.

Walas, who created the Oscar-
winning makeup for Jeff Gold-
blum in David Cronenberg’s
1986 remake of The Fly (the
original movie starred Vincent
Price and Al ”David” Hedison),

ﬁseems obsessed with his first

love: grossed-out visual effects.

Once again, in accord with
traditional, time—honored conven-
tions, this mindless sequel
doesn't even begin to match up

 to Cronenberg’s remake. As a

matter of fact, it stinks.

Erci Stoltz (Mask, Some Kind of
Wonderful) stars as Martin Brun-
dle, son of independent scientist

°Seth Brundle. Because of his
father's accidental genetic muta-
tion, Martin has accelerated
growth and reaches biological
adulthood by the chronological
age of 5.

  

’ THE
  FLY ll 

0 By Matthew Myers

Scientifically inclined and ex-
tremely brilliant, Martin begins to
follow in his father's footsteps, at-
tempting to tap into the secret of
the telepods, devices used to in-
stantaneously transport matter
from one location to another.

An evil-minded industrialist
named Bartok (Lee Richardson) is
his benefactor, while actress
Daphne Zuniga (Spaceballs) is his
assistant and romantic interest.

What eventually evolves is a re-
hashing of the standard Fly plot
— Eric transforms into a big ol’
bug like dad, complete with rub-
ber latex appliances.

Aside from the fact that Zuni-
ga should be in jail for violating

. a minor (Stoltz), the film is first-

hand Fangoria material.

The opening sequence shows
Mrs. Seth Brundle giving birth to
a 10—pound baby larvae, much
worse than the one in Cronen-
berg’s nasty abortion scene in the
remake. Here, we get to see

‘everything — umbilical cord,

sticky fly gunk and enough blood
to drown a small rat. What a
blow to natural childbirth. '
Not surprisingly, there is a
plethora of marvelous special-
effects wizardry — crushed
heads, severed fingers, melted
faces, broken syringe needles,
lots of nasty gook of all types, and
gallons and gallons of fly vomit.

  

;._.» ..;.:2:‘$. ‘ ’ hey.“

 

More gross effects from the already grotesque The Fly /I.

Hey, if you're the type who lives
in your parents’ basement and
reads nothing but gore mags, go
see this movie. You'll love it.
The picture winds up to be just
another splatter flick. The editing
is atrocious, lacking continuity
and disorienting the viewer. The
music is overbearing, the acting
is nothing more than comic book
dialogue, and Walas’ direction is
equivalent to run-of—the-mill junk.

Perhaps the only redeeming»

thing about this tasteless film is
the rather blatant theme of animal
cruelty and a few camera shots of
Goldblum looking like a melted
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, gar-
nered from Fly I.

Could it be because Chris Wa-
las is not a director but the own-
er of Chris Walas, |nc., a
special-effects company in
California? Just what is he trying
to say with this movie? Not to

For most of us, a trip to the con-
venience store rarely yields any-
thing more than a pack of
cigarettes. But for Next Presi-
dent's bassist, Pat ”Flash”
Clemente and guitarist, Kevin
”Weak Onion” Timothy, one trip
to the local Sheetz back in
November of 1987 provided

them with a little something.

extra.

There among the hot dogs and
soft drinks they found themselves
a lead singer, Nick ”F-ck-Master-
Of—The—Mountain” Ker.

”l knew him before, and l
knew he used to sing,” assured
Clemente.

With the addition of Ker, their
lineup was completed, but not
exactly stabilized. In March of
1988, original drummer Mike
Rose left the group.

”Mike was too busy with
school,” Ker explained.

”Wait, let’s tell her the truth,”
Clemente said. ”Mike walked in
and got all pissed-off because
Jack was there rehearsing with
us.”

”Well, that was part of it, but
he was really busy with school.
He didn't have the time,” Timo-

thy added.
’’It was almost like a
boyfriend/girfriend thing.

 

METROPOL

 

Like,’Oh, I found somebody bet-
ter, but what do I do?’ ” Ker
offered.

After spring break of that year,
Jack ”Kato” Schmitt found him-

self in the ranks of Next
President.
Next President is the latest

band of young, talented musi-
cians to hit the scene. Originally
hailing from Indiana, Pa., the
band has been playing here in
Pittsburgh for a while now.

impressively, their first gig in
Pittsburgh was opening for the
national act The Wild Seeds at
the Decade.

”We kind of cheesed in,” Ker
said. ’’I heard that they were a
swell bunch of guys. We saw
them unloading their stuff, and
we asked them if they wanted an
opening band. The guy goes,
’Yeah, we're kind of tired,’ and
eventually we ended up playing
for about 45 minutes.”

That's how Next President
work. Basically, they take care of
everything themselves — from
booking shows, to advertising, to
putting out records.

Last August, they released a 7"
EP that has earned some airplay
On WPTS.

”The record is old stuff now. _

We hope to have a new record
out pretty soon,” Ker said.

The guys in the band hesitate
to describe their style of music.

lt’s ”rock ’n’ drool,” according to
Schmitt.

”lt’s like musical Legos or
Tinker Toys, maybe, because Le-
gos are kind of set, but Tinker
Toys branch out more. We're
musical Tinker Toys,” Ker ex-
plained.

The band is right. it is hard to
categorize the music they play.
It's loud. It's infectious. It's fast.
lt’s rock ’n’ roll.

THE PITT NEWS,

   

 

”But when you say rock ’n’
roll,” Ker warned, ”people ex-
pect Led Zeppelin covers or
something. If you say progressive,
then they expect Depeche
Mode.”

”We’re not putting out an im-
age,” Schmitt insisted.

”We play to a diverse crowd,
to a sampling of the different
scenes,” Ker said. ”We play mus-
ic that we want, that we like, as

opposed to, ‘Oh yeah, let’s play
this. Everybody that wears a
leather jacket’s gonna play like
this.’ ”

”Do you think Husker Du or
Sonic Youth sat around and said,
’Do you think they'll like this?’
They just did what they wanted
to do, what they were into. That's
what we're into, doing what we
want to do," Schmitt added.

Next President's approach to
their music has raised some
proverbial eyebrows on a few
veterans of the scene.

”Some still sling some attitude
toward us. There's people telling
us, ‘Well, you've got to play what
people want,’ ” Ker said.

”But that's because we're a
bunch of young punks that sup-
posedly know nothing, and we
just happen to have fun playing

music and that's what we want to
do,” Timothy stated.‘

”We get along with most
bands,” Ker claimed. ”There are
plenty of good bands like The
Cynics and Heretics, the Pleas-
ureheads, that Get Hip crowd.”

"Yeah, the Get Hip guys have
always been real cool with us,”
Schmitt added.

To sum up the essence of Next
President, Schmitt concluded,
”Basica||y, we're a bunch of guys
who like to have fun and play
rock ’n’ roll. We're a young band
and we're causing a little
turmoil.”

Discussion on the history of the
black liberation movement has
usually been one—sided. How-
ever, historical study of the era of
civil rights would indicate that it
was not the non-violent move-
ment alone which brought the so-

American.

Contrary to the implication, the
social changes brought about for
African Americans were a result
of both militant and non-violent
actions. As a consequence of this,
black youth today are familiar
with Martin Luther King Jr. but
know little, if anything, about
Malcom X. '

Rarely is the movement looked
at from both streams of the strug-
gle for African—American rights —
the integrationist and the na-
tionalist.

Jeff Stetson’s The Meeting pro-
vides such an analysis. It is a play
that features a conversation be-
tween black nationalist-Malcom
X and integrationist Martin Luther

mention the fact that he seems
obsessed with scenes from James
Cameron's Aliens: by the end of
the movie, all the guards are run-
ning around like really macho fel-
-Gas, shooting a lot of ammunition,
whilemawliarge ~ i nsect stalks them in
the dark, metallic corridors of a

And the hackneyed statement
against industrial science is poor-
ly executed, except for the dis-
tinct, but predictable, recognition
in the film's final scene.

This movie is incredibly dis-
gusting and extremely nauseat-

decide to see it, go on a Friday
or Saturday night when crass lo-
cals yell at the screen during
scenes with exploding heads and

cial advancements for the African-

1 _

King Jr. This play juxtaposes the
pros and cons of both streams of
the movement for African-
American social gains: the in-
tegration movement, which
moved toward within-the-system,
non-violent, direct action; and
the nationalist movement, which
stressed self-reliance and group
solidarity within the race and was
critical of the turn—the-other-
cheek response to violent assault.

The meeting that takes place
between King and Malcom is
hypothetical. The two leaders did
meet once, but only for a brief
moment, just long enough to
pose for a picture of the two shak-
ing hands.

The script, which is set at the

   

time shortly after Malcom’s assas-
sination, ”predicts” some of the
situations we find in today's so-
ciety. In it, Malcom warns King
that later generations will not
remember their significance to
the struggle. He later states that
King will be held up as a distort-
ed model of a leader at the ex-
pense of a realistic evaluation of
the African—Americans’ situation.

The play is critical of the ten-
dency to uphold non-violence as
the only solution to the black
man's dilemma. But unlike some
nationalist criticism, it does not
contend that non-violence is .
necessarily passiveness.

Going into its 15th year, the
Kuntu Repertory Theater's
production of this play represents
its fcommitment toward raising‘ is-
sues of the African-American
community that would not be ad-
dressed by other forms of media.

The play is directed by Vernell
Lillie and stars David Earlyqas
Malcom X, Kuntu veteran Ron
Pitts as King and Leo Beatty as
Malcomfs bodygaurd, Rashad.

OK, Bob DeSalvo, you struck
our interest. Fashion!! No Bob,
we're not one of the pastel prin-
cesses who grace Pitt’s campus.
We pride ourselves in the art of
fine dress, and we wouldn't be
caught dead in the luxurious
goods that Lerners, Ormonds,
Deb's, Brooks, etc., etc., have to
offer, not to mention the count-
less other trendy shops the aver-
age mall houses.

As we walk around campus,
we gaze at all the fashion flaws
and wonder, do people ever read
the Glamour magazine Do’s and
Don'ts? The look of this campus
tells us they don't, so we thought
we would bring to you the Betty
and Wilma Do’s and Dont’s. If
you're offended —— oh well, c'est
la vie!

_ The top five don'ts for women,
and we mean DONT’S:

1) Don't wear white shoes in
winter. Only after Memorial Day!

Jhi

The

2) Don't look like a floor man-
nequin from the Limited, the
Cap, etc., etc. Add some variety
to that wardrobe!

3) Don't wear very high heels
with short, short skirts. Come on
girls, this isn't Liberty Avenue!

4) Don't tease your hair so that
it climbs to the height of Zelda's
ceiling. Feathered, permed hair is
out (Charlie's Angels has been off
the air for a long time now).

While on the subject of hair,
what is the significance ofcurling
your hair in the front and leaving
it to fend for itself in the back?
Come on, if you didn't have
feathered hair, you wouldn't have
to worry about it!

5) OK Bob, this one’s for you
— you well-dressed man! Don't
lock your entire wardrobe into
the color scheme of light pink,
baby blue, luscious lime and
banana yellow. Pittsburgh is not
exactly the tropical island to

dos and

don’ts of fashion

show off such an array of colors,
especially in the middle of the
winter.

The top five Do’s — definitely
DO these:

1) Reflect some individuality in
the way you dress! Be creative,
‘be fashion conscious. Remem-
ber, people like us are watching.

2) Always match your shoe
color with your stockings, and es-
pecially make sure it compli-
ments some color scheme in the
outfit you are wearing.

3) Every once in a while, treat
yourself to a hairstylist from a
high—fashion salon. These salons
will provide the most up—to-date
hair looks, and for the money,
you will receive good service and
a good cut.

4) Today's makeup look is very
natural, very limited, and very
subtle. Stay away from the frosty-
blue eyeshadow and the colorful
mascaras, and steer yourself

toward the natural colors.

5) Take pride in personal ap-
pearance. Dress for success.
Remember that you'll never
know who you might run into,
such as future employer, hus-
band, Pitt News Showcase
reporters...

The top five Dont’s for men —
and we mean DON'T:

1) For all you jamming men,
Jams are a big no—no! They have
been out since they came in, so
get off your surfboard and retire
those colorful mistakes.

While on the subject of swim-
wear, leave the Speedos to the
Olympic swimteam. We all
know what you've got, and due
to our shy, bashful ways, we'll
leave it with that key note.

2) Keep those high tops on the

basketball court! The Panthers are
doing a fine job of promoting the
sport of basketball without your
help. And if you can't resist wear-
ing them, those laces were put
there for a reason; they didn't cost
you any extra, so do us a favor
and tie them.
I 3) T-shirts and jeans! T-shirts
and jeans! T-shirts and jeans! Bor-
ing! Boring! Boring! Need we say
more?

4) Don't go overboard with
those acid—washed jeans. You
didn't make a mistake in the
chemistry lab and, spill acid all
over your jeans, so don't always
look like you did. -

5) Paul Bunyan left his log
cabin down on the Cathedral
lawn, so there is no need to walk

around looking like your major is
lumberjacking. Those fluorescent
orange tasse|—caps and red-and-
black checkered jackets are an
endangered species, along with
those hunting boots. When
there's no snow on the ground
and it's not monsoon season,
please leave those duck boots in
your closet, along with your
snowsuit.

The top five Do’s — please take
note:

1) Purchase some nice button-
down shirts. This is a necessity.
You can't wear a tie with a
T—shirt.

2) Order J. Crew or L.L. Bean
catalogs. They offer quality cloth-
ing that is both reasonably priced
and fashionable. Paul Bunyans,
please ignore the hunting gear!

3) if you are going to venture

BETTY

in to the '90s with long locks
from the '60s, keep them neat
and trim! Men do get split ends
and it shows!

4) You can never go wrong

pants with pleats, so make room
in your closet for these items.

Lady Panthers fall to overpowering Eagles

By Don Boyd‘
Staff Writer

A gritty, determined band of
Lady Panthers suffered a gut-
wrenching defeat to Boston Col-
lege last night by a 69-65 count

git Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt went into the game at
somewhat less than full strength.
Lorri Johnson was not feeling
well, Tabatha Long had a stiff
neck and Jennifer Shingler con-
tinued playing despite being
nicked up.

Wrestlers

to face
Edinboro  

tonight

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

The 9-3-1 Pitt wrestling team
(1-3 in the Eastern Wrestling
League) will square off with Edin-
boro University in yet another
EWL match tonight at Fitzgerald
Field House at 7:30 p_.m.

The EWL has taken on the du-
bious distinction of being the
toughest wrestling conference in

the country, according to the"

Amateur Wrestling News,
coaches and local wrestlers.

Most of the teams in the EWL
are consistently in the top 20 ev-
ery season, and Pitt has not faced
an easy opponent all season.

The intense competition en-

untered in every match tends
to-produce a paradox. I

At certain times during the sea-
son, all of the hard training and
stiff competition tends to drag the
team down and produce confi-
dence crises.

At other times, it pumps the
team up and snaps them out of
the midseason doldrums.

”We’ve competed all year long

As if that were not enough for
Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce, the Lady
Panthers’ tallest player, Connie
Hurt, was serving a suspension.

The Boston College women
reeled off the first six points of the
game, and with 10 minutes left in
the first led by a 20-12 score.

Johnson hit two consecutive
treys to bring the Lady Panthers
into the thick of the fray. By half-
time, Pitt had caught and passed
Boston College, going into the
lockeroom with a one point ad-
vantage, 38-37.

In the process of scoring 16
first-half points, Johnson passed
the thousand-point mark for her
illustrious career.

In the second half, Boston Col-
lege shot out of the starting gate
with nine straight points.
' Just when it appeared the game
might turn into a rout, the Lady
Panthers regrouped and started to
nibble away at the Boston Col-
lege lead. With just under 10
minutes to go, Pitt knotted the
contest at 52. A ,

From that point on, the game

was a nip-and-tuck affair which
kept the’ crowd on the edge of
their seats.

When Boston College took a
four-point lead with four minutes
to go, the Lady Panthers refused
to be shaken.

Pitt's Denise Becher hit a base-
line jumper, and teammate Shin-
gler followed up with a 16-foot
jumper to tie the score at 63.

The game went down to the fi- ’

nal seconds. Boston College‘
scored with 38 seconds left. Pitt
inbounded the ball and called

I throws "made the final

time with 30 seconds left.

Boston College played rugged
defense after the Lady Panthers
inbounded the ball. Finally, with
about five seconds to go, Tabitha
Long took a short, off-balance
baseline jumper. The ball bound-
ed on the rim for what seemed
like an eternity, before falling
away, sealing the Lady Panther's
fate.

Pitt quickly fouled Boston Col-
lege, and the resultant two free

Pittsburgh?

This town has not had any seri-
ous boxing since Larry Holmes
took on Renaldo Snipes at the
Civic Arena earlier in the decade.

There also has not been a real-
Iy serious boxer to come out of
the area who had a chance at a
championship since Billy Conn
lost to Joe Louis, and that was a
long, long time ago.

Entering into the picture is
Michael Moorer. Moorer, 21,
fights out of the Kronx gym in
Detroit, but he is from Monessen.

This Sunday, Moorer brings his
show back home when he will

Charleroi and then to Monessen.
Moorer spent much’ of his child-

a boxing trainer; thus began
Moorer’s rapid climb in the box-
ing world. J ,

Moorer went to the gym one

pressed with his ability, and his

ing philosophy is a well-rounded
perspective.

”I think there are a lot ofdiffer-
ent facets in coaching college.
Things you do in the gym are
directed toward volleyball,”
Woodstra observed.

Off the court she feels that
”with academics, you have a
really big influence over the stu-
dent athlete. There has been a big
emphasis on academics in wom-

en's intercollegiate sports.

”A coach has a lot of influence
in all aspects of athletes’ lives. My
role is to direct them to as good
an experience as possible in
college.”

Woodstra is grateful for the fine
reputation Pitt volleyball has,
something she is sure will be an
aid in recruiting.

”Our recruiting will be helped
by Shelton Collier’s accomplish-
ments here, as well as having the

IIIII Spur ,Illl llaar

administration's commitment to
the program,” noted Woodstra.

One of the challenges Wood-
stra sees ahead for her program
is the lack of competition in the
East for the Lady Panthers.

”It is really difficult. There are
a lot of schools in the East, but not
that many with quality volleyball
programs. We have to look for
strong teams to play. We are one
of the strongest teams in the East,
if not the strongest,” she com-
mented.

Wrestling

Continued from page 18

The biggest threat to Santoro’s
title this year has been Clarion
University's Mike Cole, current-
ly ranked first in the country.

Santoro has already lost to Cole
three times this season but is un-
phased by the statistics. Santoro
is looking forward to a chance to
face him again in the NCAAs.

Sophomore Scott Hovan, who
has been developing into an ex-
tremely aggressive wrestler this
season (especially since he threw
Penn State's Mike Bevilaqua over
the press table at the last meet),
will face two—time All—American
Terry Kennedy.

Hovan lost to Kennedy earlier
this year by a 3-2 tally.

”|t’s going to be interesting to
see how that match goes,” Stott—
lemyer said.

”Scott’s really starting to come
around and back to form, which
is what I like to see, especially be-
fore the EWL tournament.”

Panther Jeff Turner (1 58) has re-
cently brought a new weight di-
vision to the Panthers’
middle-lineup strength- -

Turner is not flashy and is not
noted for pins; but he gets the job
done and almost guarantees the
Panthers a three— or four-point
victory in any match.

Turner has recently come off a
knee injury and has been
progressing nicely throughout the
season.

Edinboro is coached by form-
er Olympic heavyweight Bruce
Baumgartner, who is a noted per-
fectionist who has seen a lot of
wrestling moves during his
career.

Pitt's 126-pounder Matt Rizzo,
feels that the EWL competition
can only be beneficial for the
Panthers.

’’If you really think about it, the
only thing that matters, the only
thing people are going to remem-
ber are the results of the EWL
tournament," Rizzo said.

”We face those wrestlers all
season long, and they're the best.
If we won that tournament
without facing those guys all sea-
son, we would constantly be ask-
ing ourselves, ’What if we faced
those guys during the regular sea-
son?’ ” Rizzo said.

Pitt only has two matches left
after Edinboro, one at Clarion this
Saturday where Santoro will face
Cole again, and then West Vir-
ginia at home on Feb. 22.

The race before the
race is dangerous to

By Mike Harris

AP Motorsports Writer

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. —
Most drivers consider the twin
125-mile races Thursday at Day-
tona International Speedway
risky business.

The two 50-lap races on Day-
tona’s 2.5-mile, high-banked oval
will determine positions three
through 30 for Sunday's $1.7 mil-
lion Daytona 500.

Some of the 61 drivers in-
volved will simply be trying to get
the feel of the track, the compe-
tition and their own cars. Others
desperately need a good finish to
get into the richest and most pres-
tigious NASCAR stock car event
of the season.

”|t’s short and flat-out, kind of
like a sprint race, and I love that,”
said Neil Bonnett, who will start
in the second row of the first race.
”Of course, nearly all ,Winston
Cup races are like that these
days.” ,

His crew chief, Leonard Wood,
is less enthusiastic about the
125-miler.

’’I don't really like having to
put all our work for the 500 in
jeopardy three days before the
big race,” he said. ”But we ac-
cept it because everybody else
faces the same risk. And the
125-milers can be helpful some-
times in getting the chassis dialed
in for the 500."

One driver who needs the 50
laps of competition to get ready
for Sunday is Jody Ridley, the
veteran driver from Georgia who
will be injured Bill Elliott's good
left hand in the 500.

Elliott,‘who has a broken left

wrist, will pass up the 125-miler ‘P

Boxing

Continued from page 15

tion of Terrence Walker, and the
other was a fifth-round knockout
of Ramzi Hassan this past De-
cember. It was after this fight that
Moorer was named the light
heavyweight champion of the
newly formed World Boxing Or-
ganization. Moorer’s last fight
was in January against Victor
Claudio, which resulted in a
second—round knockout for
Moorer.

Steward does not give much
credit to the ratings system and
the various championships that
are given out almost every week.

”We plan on making Michael
the most thought of and active
light heavyweight out there, and
the public will decide and accept
him as the light heavyweight
champion,” Steward said.

Even with his rapid rise, Moor-
er will not take any opponent

lightly.

”All of my opponents give me
trouble; they all want something
that I [have],” Moorer said.
”Maybe I got up there a lot quick-
er than a lot of other guys be-
cause [Steward] has a name.”

So how does a kid become so
well—known without ever fighting
a big name? In the boxing world
of Emanuel Steward, a young
boxer is not judged by how many
fights he has had against top op-
ponents. A young fighter’s.worth
is judged by work in the gym dur-
ing sparring sessions, and that is
where Moorer has excelled.

At the Kronx Gym, amateurs
‘spar with professionals, and spar-
ring is not confined to a specific
weight class; that means a mid-
dleweight can end up sparring
with a light heavyweight. It gives
the fighters a chance to go against
fighters with different speeds and

styles.

The most impressive example
of Moorer as a fighter who will
have to be reckoned with was in
1987, when Darnell Knox was
getting ready to fight Michael
\lunn (the IBF middleweight
:hampion). Knox needed a spar-
ing partner and Moorer was
Ivailable.

’’I thought he was just a tall kid,
and he would just run around out
there, but his balance and posi-
tion were  great,” Steward said.

Moorer proceeded to punish
Knox and put him on the canvas;
Knox got out of the ring and re-
fused to go back in.

Knox went on to lose to Nunn,
and to this day, Emanuel Steward
attributes it to the beating Knox
took at the hands of Moorer in
training.

Probably the most telling sign
for a fighter at the Kronx would
be to see how well he does
against Thomas Hearns. Moorer
has yet to step into the ring with
Hearns, for various reasons. Ac-
cording to Moorer, it is because

he is not ready, and he does not ’

want to get his head bashed in.
Steward sees it a little
differently.

”Tommy would have to use

both guns to stay in there because 9‘ A

Michael punches so hard.”

So what is the deal with Moor-
er? Is he really as good as Steward
would have us believe, or is he
going to end up as just another
media creation who falls by the
wayside?

Probably not. Moorer has a lot
