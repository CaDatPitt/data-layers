Council ‘Legalizes’

N 0,, Says University
 - 'Interfraternity' Council may
0 test the university’s policy on
p _-_ the use of alcoholic beverages
 on campus this Friday.

‘ ’.The council, at its meeting
‘last Wednesday, unanimously

passed a two-part motion con-

cerning the liquor policy. One part
said all ‘fglﬁliernities would attend
a party scheduled ’_for Friday at
. which. alcoholic", beverages would
-be served. . —
However, the party remains
tentative and according to some
sources, it will -fall through. If
the, affair does take place, how-
fever, the outcome would have

 

~' ture policy of the university
concerning ‘the liquor problem.
A ,  The second. part of the motion,
 i « proposed by Fred Whittier, legal-
 — ized the use of. alcoholic beverages
' -“:;_ in fraternity houses. This’-section,
’ ' though, directly contradicts what
the ‘present, policy apparently is.
‘ The present policy stems from
a 1958 ruling by the" Board -of
;‘_2V,\? T-rustees which says alcoholic bev-
_ erages shall ‘not be sold or served
__ '”,‘f. to undergraduates on any proper-
. ‘ . .ty of the university or at any uni-
 ‘versity-‘sponsored In e -e t in g or
function.‘ . .
 Added onto this policy is a 1951
ruling by'the housing area against
drinking in the dormitories. This
was extended-last year to include
‘fraternity and’ sorority, houses.

By HARRIET A. WERNER
The Senate has "established a
temporary committee of students
[to determine what the relation-
ships are between the minor judi-
"eiaries and the Supreme Court.
.’ Phil Williams, chairman of the
‘Senate, said, "The Student Affairs
gcomrnittee is having a‘ difficult
‘ﬂtime in, selecting the seven Jus-
'tices-Elect because of the neces-
sity of making caraful selectieri"
A “Another reason that is slowing
" ',up this process of selection is that
-differences of opinion concerning
_~.procedure exist between the

   

.; Ijmeht Association Judicial Com-
" , mittee.” V
.-,-..-. “Because of the slowness in
‘ , setting up this committee, the
Senate decided to set up a tem-
porary committee in order that
“* extra time for investigation and
 analysis of the court system
could be secured.”
 -The Senate gave Williams the

1 ‘power to select the members of.

 “ this committee; however, they re-
‘J "T quested that past judiciary heads
 I be included. A
' Because of misunderstanding
~ arising over the course evalua-
*«tion. program, Herb Blitzstein,
president of the Arts cabinet,
made the following clariﬁcation
of the purpose of the evaluation
‘ which has been misunderstood
, and misrepresented by both stu-
Ii , dents and the Pitt News.
,  Blitzstein said, “Our objective is
 _ toassist the various Liberal Arts
'. departments in evaluating the ef-
fectiveness of their curriculum;
tr. assist individual faculty mem-
bers in evaluations of their
courses; to establish standards and
- techniques for evaluation which
at valid and reliable and to ac-
quaint students with the result
of the evaluation.

Blitzenstein, concluded by say-
ing ‘This is a course evaluation.’
Jim Vaughn, Arts, ’62, presented
two different types of evaluation
programs —--a teacher evaluation
conducted by the university and a
course evaluation. by students.

The following senators were
— elected to positions on the Sen-
ate: Morrison Lewis, Jr.——Par-
Iiamentarian; T o m Lohrentz—-
Chaplain and President Pro
Tern. . ‘
“ Phil Williams and Larry Land
. ‘were chosen as representatives to
the Pi t t s b u r g h Intercollegiate
Council. Williams and Bev. Ro-
‘ 1 iberts were chosen as student gov-
ernment representatives to t h e
Student Affairs Committee. Jay
Fingeret was chosen to represent
_the Senate on the committee for
"the student handbook.
The following appointments
by Chuck Islet, president of the
student body, were approved by
the Senate: Sue Waite-—Direc-
5 _tor of Social Standards; Dale

Larry Land informed Senators
concerned with the problem of

—".:t.Professor C. Northcote Parkinsonris quite a fellow. He,
_ is!-humorous, satirical and daring, to mention a few of his

,0 «qualities. The author of Parkinson’s Law (work expands to
‘ﬁll’ the time available for its completion) was daring indeed

when he addressed a huge crowd here last Friday.
..;.,/One -of t-he many witty and clever topics he discussed
as a meeting of a university’s ﬁnance committee. The ﬁrst
 _e1_'_n of-business, Professor Parkinson explained, was acting
‘ nthe physics department request for a $20 million dollar
Jf§e'act_o_r. ’
3  -Althoughno one quite knew what it would be used
or, some type of reactor was needed because it served as
iahstatus symbol among universities. 1 ' r
V After this request was passed in two minutes ﬁat, an
English literature professor had the audacity to ask for a
' ew blackboard he needed so desperately. It would cost
only $34.80,the “rash man” told the committee. _
. —r‘~tTo make 5 long story short, the professor didn’t ‘get his
blackboard because the committee though it was being too
Qfrivolous to buy'a new blackboard when there surely was
" "n old one somewhere on/campus, not being used every‘.
minute of the day. , »
 ’Although Professor,Parkinson might not have known
speciﬁcally what similar circumstanceslexist at this uni-
“versity, he was on fairly safe grounds to assume that this

he-foibles of university and organizational life, this par—
ticular topic did hit home. '
 Only last week the university announced plans ‘for ‘a
‘$l—3,millon dormitory. A new natural sciences building is
“eing'con”structed behind Clapp Hall. A new bookstore 1S
opening. A parking garage is in the process ofconstruction.
5Property is rapidly being. purchased. V
} These progressive moves and others ($20 million dollar
reactors) toward a great university are only to be com-
jjnended. But what about the $34.80 blackboards? ~
 A’ number of these “blackboards” are needed in the Ca-
hedral of Learning. Many of the needs we could mention
-,The walls on the tenth ﬂoor never have‘ been ﬁnished.
und astrivial as that English literature professor’s need.
The bare ‘tile bricks and the mesh wire still are the ﬁrst‘
‘things that hit anyone who steps onto that ﬂoor or passes
_ by on an elevator. Some of the classrooms in_ the Cathedral
 ,;_ need touching up badly. A speciﬁc example is 326, which
surely resembles an air raid shelter from the last world
war that was hit a few times.
Many of the chairs in the classrooms look like, they, too,
A have been through much. And Tuck Shop ice cream, coffee
7 and everything else still winds up in paper cups instead of
Q the usual dishes and cups. The list goes on and on.
" Someday maybe someone will sneak the $34.80 black-
board at the top of the committee's agenda and the mem-
* bers, out of habit, will okay it.

No Fun for Anyone

By Ronald Barford

Evil Automation is not only stealing jobs from
workers but it is also stealing something that we
here at Pitt cherish: Good Old Registration Day.
They want to hand us our registration packets,
take our tuition money and send us skipping on
our way back to Gustine’s._

I kind of hate to see the old system go. The-

 

food in the cafeteria isn’t bad; _ -
the gags about the atrocious tui- ff ' it 7
tion' increase are stale; ‘nobody :
minds the condition of the Tuck
Shop; what's left to complain '
about?

1 Each stage_ of registration
provided its own little particular .
annoyances to supply material 
for conversations between people 3
who met while standing in some 
line or other. While waiting in
most of,the lines you didn’t make‘
acquaintances; you made lasting friends.

In fact I knew a boy. and a girl who met in a
line, dated, went steady and were engaged. This
was all before they reached the end of the line.

To Look Sharp .. . .

 

One fellow had to have his place saved in line

three different times. He had to shave. _

There is one advantage to the lengthy line. If
you have weighty problems to solve,- but can’t
seem to ﬁnd the time to work on them, pack‘ a
lunch and get into a’ registration line.

Remember how we griped ‘when we stood in

line for a half an ‘hour to get our registration.
packets and just as 'we’*'were nearing the counter .

we had a football player push his way in front

of us? Or the fellow, who is too small for these
tactics, who comes over and starts talking to some

of his friends in front of us and just “moseys”

on in with them?

Remember how we ‘emptied our registration
packets onto the tables in the writing division and
stared in stunned amazement at the number of
cards that they had jammed into the little devils?

Remember the little white schedule cards that
never had enough lines to ﬁll in your entire sched-
ule? And remember the little words under the
lines on the cards that always changed from
Pittsburgh address to home adress after you’d
ﬁlled out the space in ink. And remember the
spaces themselves which were an entire inch long
intwhich you had to write West Alphonsus Xavier
Smith Junior and ‘Senior High School?

Letters/To The Editor   

Chass View Criticized
For Recent Cdlumn

Editor, the Pitt News:

Murrayvchass’ column on ath-
letic “red shirts” (March 7)
made, as"ﬁne’business sense as
anything we have heard of late.
Chass proposes that since the
red-shirt is a financial liability
to theiUniversity, his aid ‘ought
to be dropped.

Likewise if the athlete has not
sufficient ability to pla-y with
some regularity his aid should
‘be curtailed. In other .words, the
athlete is hiredhto score goals or
touchdowns; if he fails to pro-

duce he should be ﬁred. Chass is. .

guilty of serious error on sev-
eral _ counts: / A ‘

1: While the University may
be a bit commercial in its atti-
tude toward varsity sports, it is
not yet engaged in_ operating "a
professional football or basket-
ball team. When it offers an ath-
lete a scholarship it offers him
\the opportunity_ to get a valuable
degree in additionto the oppor-
tunity to get athletic experience.

‘As long as the athlete passes_
his courses he must thus be guar- .

anteed a- chance to ﬁnish, re-
gardless of how little he helps
his team. Otherwise the athlete
himself would be in the position
oftaking a terrible risk in com-
ing to college in the first place.

2. There are some athletes who
are sincerely interested in mak-
ing the most of their educations.
Sometimes these athletes simply
prove not to have the ability to
become a regular at sports. I re-
call the case of a friend who en-
tered_Pitt on scholarship, show-
ed little athletically as a fresh-
man, was red-shirtedthis year,
and will probably be primarily
a bench warmer for the next
three years.

Yet this young man is main-
taining about a 3.8 QPA in the
school of Liberal Arts. Chass
suggests that his scholarship be
removed, which would doubtless
compel the young man to_ drop

__out .of__s'chool_l-,.Or at «least curtail

r 1 .'I‘<he”~,a,cédexI.1.ic.. scho1ar‘ships___avai1,_'-

 
   
    

-able simply would not be suffi-
cient to maintain him here.

Many ..times this young man
has felt under great pressure of
losinghis scholarship because he
has not been playing ball well.
It. would be a tragedy to force
him to leave Pitt. "

In suavely accepting Pitt’s

,.commercialism, Chasswhas shown f

, New Prpposal Added ' 

himself even tube a poor cynic,
for his proposals show no insight
at all into the basic issue, which
is the discrepancy between the
athletic and the academic schol-
arship". —

If Editor Chass wishes to make

any more proposals let him con-'

sider their effects with somewhat
more care. ~ . '

Editor,’ the Pitt News:

Wefwould like to extend our
warmest and heartiest: heartfelt
congratulations to the Greek
Week Sing Committee. We feel
that the true brotherhood of
Greek Week was embodied dur-
ing this yearfs seminars_ and
competition. ’ _

Such competition nullifies stu-
dent apathy and animosity caus-

ed by combined parties, radicals,

and chill winds. We congratu-
late the honorable, unbiased, and

capable judges for discovering
the hidden talent of the winning
organization which was seeming-
ly invisible to thg audience.

The costuming and stage pre-
sentation was' excellent by all
the groups; however, simplicity
seemed to be the keynote of the
winning. group. Of course, .ele-
ments of previous Greek Sings
were present in abundancy. Un-
derhandedness, trickery, deceit,
and chicanery were certainly not
present.

The traditional winning posi-
tion of the aforementioned group
may tend to stifle initiative and

. competitivespirit. This problem
. could. be alleviated ‘by an occas-

An ardent anti-administrator

spoke at a, university up to its?

Pa-rki,nson’s talk was an oral re-

“Math is a staus symbol. It

This will be the Blue and

the Panthers won it and then re-

Penn State will be the team to
beat at -Princeton. They went
undefeated during the regular
season with a tie to the Pan-

champion, Lehigh, will be tough

Lauchle has lost one match while
winning 16. This loss came at the
hands of Dick Auble, of Cornell,
who will be wrestling in the 130
class in the Easterns, the same as
Lauchle.

Auble_ -beat Lauchle in the
ﬁnals of the National tourna-
ment last year by the score of
10-4 but Lauchle beat the Cor-
nell star two times during the
summer’ while losing the same
number. So if Lauchle and
Auble meet'in the Easterns this
year (which they probably will)!
it should be‘ the best bout of the
tourney.

Martin should be seeded num-
ber one in his division and looks
like the best bet to come up with
a first place for the Peerymen.
Kelvington may be seeded one,
two or three since he had two
draws during the regular season.
His biggest problem will be get-
ting his weight d-own before Fri-
day. If he doesn’t have to lose a
couple of pounds Friday morning
he has a good chance to capture
the 137 pound class.

Zolikoff should be seeded first
in the 147 pound class but he will
have to beat some rough oppo-

--2-Tear'n Loses

To Majors

By DARLEEN WALKER

Time ran out just a little
too soon for the Women’s In-
tramural Basketball team last
week. The team was making
a successful retaliation
against the women Majors in
the fourth quarter, but the, clock
short only three
points behind their opponents.

At the end of the first quarter
the Majors led 16,to 8. They con-
tinued this leadA'31 to 14 in the
second guarter and 41 to 22 in the
.third. The intramural team made
a ﬁne comeback in the last quar-

- ter, but it wasn’t good enough and

the ﬁnal score stood. at 44 to 41
in favor of the Majors.

Sallie Wa1clie’s‘ 24 points were
high for the intramural team, but

’ ' the '11 free throws that the team

pmissed were also an important

1 ' factor in the game. Tomorrow at

, 4:45 p.m. the Intramural team.

. IF ‘ Passes Motion to Permit

Alcoholic Drinks at Fraternities

(Continued from Page 1)
Stephen Foster Memorial Hall and
the’Student Union also have bans
on drinking.

1 The original Board of Trust-
ees’ ruling in 1931 ruled against
drinking byanyone on the cam-
pus.

Dr. William Swartzbaugh, dean

I of students, refused to comment
,~ I on the action taken by Interfra-_

ternity Council, stating that he
wasnot present when the motion
was presented and therefore did
not officially know of its exist-
ence.
However, fraternity presidents
last week (after the IFC meet-
ing) received letters concerning
the university’s policy on "alco-
holic beverages signed by Dr.
Swartzbaugh. ‘
.The letter, in part, said:

“The” use or possession of in-
toxicating beverages is specifically
prohibited in Stephen Foster
Memorial, the Student Union and
all resident halls and facilities

-of the university.
“It is, of ' course, recognized .

that ‘the university does not le-
gally hold title to any fraternity
house or many facilities pres-

" ‘  ently used by sororities.”
I » 5 Concluding, Swartzbaugh stated,

 »“I am, of course, conﬁdent that
 the I.F. Council and the individual

"presidents and groups involved
will uphold the existing regula-

I._{' "  tion.”

BRIDGING THE GAP

...from components, equipments, and subsystems
to fully integrated, large-scale systems

V Air defense "missiles, unmanned interceptors, manned
interceptors, early warning aircraft, long-range radar, gap
filler radar, Texas towers, vast communication nets, high»
speed. computers and advanced information display
devices are a few of the integral parts in an air defense
system. Each of these has "its individual operational char.-
acteristics and it is the responsibility of The MITRE
Corporation to provide the basic system engineering and
design necessary to ‘integrate these many diverse and
complex parts into a mutually compatible, fully»
integrated air defense system. , ‘

Formed under sponsorship of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, MITRE employs the skills of
engineers, mathematicians, physicists and psychologists
on large-scale system projects ranging from design
through prototype engineering and subsystem develop-
ment to test and evaluation of the total on-line\‘system.
