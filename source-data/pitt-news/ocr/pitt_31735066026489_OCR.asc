UPMC/Magee

Health care expert says
hospital needs to remember
research and teaching

Hal Turner
News Editor

The new partnership between
UPMC Health System and
Magee—Women’s Hospital has led
one health care expert to worry
that the hospital is more concerned
with recruiting patients than
research and medical training.

The trend of UPMCHS to
affiliate itself with every medical
facility in the area, he said, is a tac-
tic meant to remove the local com-
petition, according to Dr. Gordon
MacLeod, president of the
University Senate and a professor
in Pitt’s medical school.

“It’s my feeling that the mod-
iﬁcation of the health care system
concerns me greatly,” said
MacLeod, referring to the UPMC
Health System’s recent alignment
with hospitals all over Western
Pennsylvania.

“Health System” is a title
UPMC adopted in January which
signiﬁes the hospital’s wish to
become a one-stop—shop for health

It has become ‘an

—— all from

‘The whole idea of integrated
delivery systems  is an unproven
experiment in our social fabric,”
MacLeod said. “No one has
shown this will be effective.”

Dr. Gordon Mac (a elt) says the ’’integrated health ste’ concept itill a

‘70s and who served as the

said that UMPCHS is in danger of
focusing too much on proﬁt and

threefold: provide “tertiary,” or
cutting—edge medical care like its
wor1d—renown transplant program;
train doctors and medical students;
and conduct extensive medical
research, according to MacLeod.
Because the hospital must
fund the expensive tertiary care

  

 

and medical training and research,
it charges more for services than
smaller community hospitals,
according to MacLeod.

He said that insurance compa-
nies are then more likely to send

Pitt students are saying Wes,” they
want to ride Port Authority Transit buses for
ﬁee.

John Morgan, director of transportation
for the Department of Parking and
Transportation, said that as of yesterday
afternoon, 90 percent of the students who
voted on the proposal voted yes.

Around 3,000 students had voted by
2:30 p.m., and Morgan said he expected that
number to climb to 3,500 by the time voting
ended.

‘”That’s pretty strong voting for this
campus,” he said, referring to Pitt students’
chronic image as apathetic.

Robert Harkins, head of Parking and

Transportation, called the voter turnout a
“pretty strong showing” that would help his
department “get some sense of where they
are” with the proposal.

“I’d like to see 30,000 students vote so
we could see what everybody thinks,”
Harkins said. “Obviously, I know that isn’t
going to happen.”

Yesterday was the last oﬂicial day for
students to vote. In an effort to get as many
students as possible to vote, Parking and
Transportation set up tables where students
could cast their ballots.

Two of the tables collected votes in the
William Pitt Union: one near the Schenley
Cafe and the second across from the infor-
mation desk on the main ﬂoor.

Other tables sat in the Towers lobby, ._

The clean of Pitt’s Faculty of Arts
and Sciences said the faculty reduction
that will occur in July after 163 profes-
sors retire will reduce costs in the col-
lege without harming the quality of
education.

But some faculty members say the
cost—saving tactic of replacing experi-
enced professors with part—time teach-
ers is a dangerous direction for the
University to go.

The more than 40 percent of 381
eligible tenured faculty members at Pitt
who have opted to participate in the
retirement incentive plan is about what
FAS expected, said Dean Peter
Koehler.

“It was a little higher than we’d
estimated,” he said. “But it’s within the
range we originally estimated.”

The package guarantees retiring
faculty members a one—time payment
of 1.5 times their armual salary, but no
more than a maximum of $125,000.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
the large number of retirements can be
attributed to the fact that Pitt hasn’t had
a retirement package for a few years.

“We were seeing a backlog of
tenured faculty waiting for a retirement
package to come along,” he said.

In a press release sent out in early
April, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said the “level of participation was sig-
nificantly higher” than the 30 percent
they originally deemed as necessary to
accomplish the University’s plans to
save money and bring in younger fac-
ulty.

These plans hinge on bringing in
younger untenured professors that will
receive less money than the tenured
faculty they are replacing. Along with
this, as part of its Phase Four plan
unveiled last summer, FAS plans to cut
the overall number of faculty in the
college from 527 to a target number of
505.

Koehler said that when the retire-

ment plan kicks in on July 1 and the
tenured faculty go the college will be
30 positions below the 505 they’re tar-
geted for. A ‘

Koehler said they hope to recruit
younger faculty with new ideas and
energy. A

“In this way we really have an
opportunity to grow,” he said.

, But since Koehler himself is step-
ping down as dean, FAS’ direction
relies on John Cooper from Pitt’s
chemistry department, who will take
the reins of the school on July 1 as
well.

Biology professor Frederick
Gottlieb is one of the tenured faculty
who accepted the retirement plan. He
said he felt it’s time for him to get out.

He commented on Pitt’s new prior-
ities which were outlined in an open
letter from Provost James Maher in
January. '

“I’m very concerned with [Pitt’s]
new priorities that place undergraduate
education last at Pitt,” Gottlieb said.

He is also upset that the University
intends to replace full—time tenured
faculty with part time professors and
associate professors and post—doctoral
fellows.

The plan was approved by Pitt’s
board of trustees last October and is
designed to save between $10 and $14
million over the next seven years.

Tenured faculty members are eligi-
ble for the plan if they’ve been at Pitt
for at least 12 years and are at least 60
years old as of July 1, 1998, according
to the press release.

This may be the last chance for
aging faculty to get a retirement bonus
for quite some time. The board of
trustees also approved a resolution say-
ing it wouldn’t support another such
retirement plan in the future.

The idea is that after this large
group leaves in July the University will
no longer have a backlog and profes-
sors looking to retire in the future will
have to rely on the general retirement
plan.

pitals, hurting UPMC ﬁnancially.

“Most academic medical centers are
not proven money—rnaking enterprises,”
said MacLeod.

But Lori Weryha, a Magee-
Women’s Hospital spokeswoman, said
the partnership is little more than the
hospitals’ attempts to bolster each other’s
strong points.

“They’ve [UPMCHS] really shown
a commitment to our mission, and that’s
important,” said Weryha.

She also said that Magee has been
actively searching for about a year to join
a local hospital in order to ensure its
future. The partnership provides a safety
net for Magee.

“It’s like adding a few more planks
to a bridge that’s not in danger of falling
down,” she said. “It can only help.”

The UPMCHS Board of Directors
President George Taber described how

each hospital helps the other.

“By formalizing and strengthening

1 the synergistic relationship between the

UPMC Health System and Magee-
Women’s Hospital, both organizations

J, will be able to expand their scope of ser-
 vices, UPMC programmatically and

.Magee geographically,” he said.
Weryha said that UPMCHS and

T Magee will share ﬁnancial and medical

responsibility for patients, but that
Magee was not actually bought, and the
reports that the two had merged were
inaccurate.

She also said that she foresaw no

THE PITT NEWS

loss of jobs in areas where the two hos-
pitals’ services overlap. But, Weryha
added, there’s no guarantee.

Reuben Slesinger, a Pitt professor
who teaches several economics courses
and who has conducted research on
Pittsburgh area hospitals, predicted a 15
to 2()—percent rate of job loss due to the
elimination of duplicate services.

Slesinger also predicted that in
about ﬁve years, Pittsburgh will have
two or three high-tech hospitals like
UPMC, and scores of smaller hospitals
to treat less serious medical problems.

For the time being, these health care

giants like UPMCHS continue to collect
satellite partners and make aﬁiliations as
a result of the federal govemment’s
“tightening its belt,” according to an
April 11 article in_Nat:ional Journal, a
publication on politics and policy.
. The federal government is cutting
$5 billion over the next ﬁve years from
funding for medical training programs at
academic medical centers. This is just
another reason for UPMCHS to keep
buying out its competitors, MacLeod
said.

Academic medical centers some-
times have money left over from their
training programs, which they invest and
use to buy other hospitals and facilities,
according to MacLeod. So before the
governrnent’s pinch is felt, UPMCHS
can make its moves, he said.

UPMCHS spokeswoman Jane
Dufﬁeld could not be reached last
evening and Taber did not respond to a
request for further comments.

Benedum Hall lobby and in the Parking and
Transportation office. On Monday, Parking
and Transportation set up a ‘ table in
Sutherland Hall.

Table attendants scarmed students’ ID
cards with a device similar to those used in
the libraries. They then asked students how
they wanted to vote and entered those deci-
sions into a computer.

Parking and Transportation staff member
Joe Artman worked at the table in the Union
near the information desk. He said that over
160 students stopped to vote at his table and
that they were reacting positively. Only four
opposed the proposal.

“Most of the students understand what
the proposal is all about,” he said. “They’re
voting yes to support it.”

Freshman Vanessa Sanchez said she
voted for the proposal because it would make
riding PAT buses more convenient.

“Paying 50 cents to ride downtown isn’t
that bad, but free is better,” she said. “I never
go down there now, but would like to. Riding
the buses for ﬂee would give people more
incentive to go downtown.” ’ ‘

Sanchez said she was not disgruntled by
the prospect of paying a higher parking and
transportation fee. She would rather pay one
lurnp-sum fee than have to put money into
the fare box every time she rides a bus.

None of the ﬁnal results had been tallied
yesterday afternoon, according to transporta-
tion manager Jerry Kvortek Some students
had requested to vote last night and Parking
and Transportation was waiting for those
votes to be cast. He expected the totals to be

ready sorrretime

if students  proposal,thevplan' _

will move on to the transportation committee.
That group is made up of representatives
from the student body, University administra-
tion and student groups.

The transportation committee will then
re-evaluate the plan, and if they approve it,
the plan must move through administrative
channels to the board of trustees for a ﬁnal
vote. The Board must approve the proposal
before it can be ﬁnalized with P/XI‘.

According to Morgan, Parking and
Transportation watched for fraudulent voting.

 students were allowed to vote and
were allowed one ballot each, although the
computer system supporting the voting Web
site and the computers at the voting tables
could not identify if students have voted more
than once or if a faculty member voted,
Morgan said

However, Parking and Transportation
staff will double-check all the voters’ identiﬁ-
cation numbers to make sure they are valid
and that students voted only once.

Any numbers that do not match student
ID numbers or that belong to faculty mem-
bers who are not also students will be dis-
carded. If a student voted more than once,
only the initial vote would be counted

Students who missed yesterday’s dead-
line can still vote at the Parking’ and
Transportation Web site. Morgan said the late
votes will eventually be added to the tally.

Kvortek predicted that students would
ultimately approve the proposal.

“We believe in the proposal and the
opportunities it will give the students,” he
said

For now, Coca-Cola scraps plans for the new curvy can

Across the Nation

ATLANTA — Coca-Cola’s new curvy can
is headed to the recycle bin — for now.

-The company says it is pulling the con-
toured, red, 12-ounce can from four of the
ﬁve markets where it has been tested- for the
last year.

Coke wants to straighten out problems
with the can as it tries to repeat the success
of its curvy bottle.

One problem is the cost of production.
A Coke sales manager in Tucson, 
says consumers liked the can but not always
enough to pay an extra 10 to 12 percent.

Other hurdles include ﬁtting the cans
into vending machines and coming up with
displays for the difI”erent—size packaging.

    

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright was warning that
Americans could be in danger abroad if a
scheduled execution wasn’t stopped last
night in Virginia

Albright told students at Howard
University the issue in convicted killer
Angel Francisco Breard’s case is “reciproc-
ity.”

The World Court has ruled that
Virginia denied Breard his rights, because it
did not notify his home nation of Paraguay
that he had been arrested, convicted and
sentenced.

Albright said it is important that
Americans who get into trouble abroad be
accorded their rights to see diplomats.

But she is at odds with the Justice

Department, which is urging the Supreme
Court to let the execution go forward.

Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said he will
wait for the Supreme Court before deciding
on Albright’s request for a stay’ of execu-
tion.

Teaching at Pitt: a lesser
calling than research?

If all goes as the powers-that-be have planned,
the faculty who accept Pitt's retirement-incentive
package this year will be replaced with bright,
young, energetic researchers.

But administrators probably will not expect
these new assistant professors to excel at teaching.
That duty will be shoved onto part-time faculty and
postdoctoral fellows.

Many professors have expressed fear since this
plan came out a year ago that, as more and more of
the teaching load is ‘shifted to faculty who will not
be eligible for tenure, teaching will increasingly be
considered a lesser calling at this so-called institu-
tion of higher learning. -

Assistant professors and associate professors
will quickly learn —— if they haven't already — that
excellence in teaching will not help them to gain
promotion through the ranks. Tenure and fu1l—pro-
fessorship will become rewards for research, while
less and less attention will be paid to undergradu-
ate education. ,

Undergrads will increasingly be taught by part-
timers and postdocs who will be expected to carry
much more of the teaching load than tenure—stream
faculty, yet they will be paid a pittance for their
efforts.

Provost James Maher sent a letter to faculty in
January in which he described the mission of the
University of Pittsburgh: Research came first,
graduate education came second, and undergradu-
ate teaching came last.

Of course, this makes some sense: Research
generates revenue for the University through
grants and contracts with outside industries, so it's
no surprise that Pitt would rather emphasize

research than providing the service of teaching for C

which we, as students, already pay a lot of money.

Pitt will get our tuition either way, so there's no
need to give us a quality education in return if it
can get more money through focusing on research.

That is, unless administrators are right when
they say part—timers and postdoc teachers will pro-
vide just as good, if not better, education than do
tenured professors.

But in that case, it will be the underpaid, over-
worked teachers whom Pitt will be cheating.

Either way, Pitt will be giving somebody the
short end of the stick.

Since the fall of communism in
1991, Sen. John Kerry notes in his
recent book "The New War," a prob-
lem has been brewing beyond the
borders of the United States. High-
tech, wealthy and ruthlessly efficient
terrorists and international crime
rings have capitalized upon the col-
lapse of authority in many places in
the world and, according to Sen.
Kerry, threaten to "rob us not only of
our money, but our way of life."

Like something out. of a James
Bond movie, these people have, in
recent years, become increasingly
dangerous to the security of the
United States, perhaps more so than
the armies of all of our enemies com-
bined.

Thanks to new technologies like
the Internet and the wider availabili-
ty of intemational air travel, crimi-

ﬁelds in eastern Turkey are linked to
the heroin dealer in downtown
Detroit; the banker laundering drug
money in Vienna is in league with the

our legal system, rife with conﬂicting
jurisdictional issues and antiquated
rules, is ill—suited for dealing with
criminals who, in many cases, actual-
ly control the governments of some
small countries.

Though we may dismiss the idea
as paranoia, the fact is that the pres-
ence of international crime can be
felt everywhere. Drug dealers here in
the United States receive most of
their product from sources outside of

the United States. Money laundering
and credit scams in the banking
industry cost American consumers
billions of dollars. A story in Sports
Illustrated a few weeks ago reported
that the owner of the Tampa Bay
Lightning NHL franchise is reputed
to be a member of the Yakuza, the
Japanese Maﬁa. The inﬂuence of
international crime is insidious.

The drug trade is a particular
threat to the security of the United
States because the drug cartels have
accumulated so much power in
recent years. They are now, for‘all
intent and purpose, in direct control
of several Latin American countries.
In a recent ﬁve year span the drug
cartels succeeded in killing 60
judges, 70 journalists, four presiden-
tial candidates, and more than 1,000
police oﬂicers in Columbia. The car-
tels also succeeded in rewriting the
Columbian Constitution in 1991 to
prohibit the extradition of Columbian
nationals to foreign countries, a

move that severely impairs the abili- .

ty of the United States to ﬁght the
drug trade. In effect, Columbia has
become a safe haven for drug smug-
glers.

Likewise, in Mexico, politicians
are reluctant to make a serious com-
mitment to ﬁghting drug shipments
into the United States because the
cartels either bribe or kill politicians
and prosecutors who attempt to
make their voices heard. Also, it
makes little economic sense to
attempt to stop the ﬂow of narcotics
north into the United States because
the drug trade constitutes a $30 bil-
lion dollar industry in Mexico. It is a
cruel irony: If politicians there do the
right thing and move against the car-
tels, they risk being killed and harm-
ing their fragile economy. It is easy to
see why Mexican politicians have

found it to be in their best interest to
remain silent and do nothing.

In addition to drug smuggling
and money laundering, international
criminals may in the future attempt to
get their hands on chemical or bio-
logical weaponry. The United States
is perilously unprepared to deal with
an attack by terrorists employing
these agents. Few people today are
currently vaccinated against diseases
like anthrax or smallpox.

In the case of smallpox, vaccina-
tions were stopped altogether in 1972
when the disease was thought to
have been eradicated If there were to
be a new outbreak of the disease
today, the result would be a disaster
because it would take months to cre-
ate a new vaccine and distribute it to
the American public. One doctor,
observing the potential chaos that :a
biological attack could cause in the
United States, lamented, "We in pub-
lic health are not ready [to deal with
that] at this time." Thanks to tech-
nologies like the Internet, the recipes

for things like smallpox and anthrax :
are widely available to those who .

might desire to use them. An observ-
er noted that "detection or interdic-
tion of those planning to use such
weapons is almost impossible."

During his 1961 inaugural
address, President John F. Kennedy
spoke of the need for the people of
the United States to prepare them-
selves to ﬁght in what he called the
"long, twilight struggle" against the
forces of communism. Such a com-
mitment from the American people
may be needed in the ﬁiture to ﬁght
against the forces of terrorism and
crime. Are we up to it?

POINT /COUNTERPOINT

British beer a better brew

James Maude

Columnlst

Everyone knows that when it comes
to beer, we Europeans manufacture the
best. Only the non—connoisseurs and the
alcoholic equivalent of junk—food birrgers
would even consider drinking the bland
offerings of Coors, Miller, Budweiser, Iron
City, Molson and American barley deriva-

. tives which they assume is beer. Well, their

assumptions are flawed!
Beer consists of a Holy Quartet:
water, hops, barley and yeast. Together,

' mixed in the right combination and

brewed for the right amount of time, the
taste is as divine as licking the sweat off
Jesus Christ's forehead. But in the wrong
combination, and rapidly brewed with
modern technology, this Holy Quartet
becomes Satan's bastard juice.

When it comes to beer in Europe,
everyone knows that the British produce
the best But that damn little hyperbolist
insists on attacking my country's native
brew (which can be either the United
Kingdom or South Africa, depending on
my mood) and has the audacity to say that
American beer is far superior. I shall have
to drum the truth into the heads of you dis-
sident colonists.

Boddington's is a ﬁne, creamy ale that
has a rich, black consistency and a smooth
yet bitter taste. Whitbread, Bass and
Theakston‘s Old Peculiar (a strange name,
but not a peculiar taste) are strong ales
from Yorkshire, where the brew is almost
as bitter as the people. The further ‘North
you go, across the border into Scotland, the
heavier the beer. Skol and McEwans rule
the taps there, and are one step short of a
stout. Good stuff, but heavy duty wear-

and-tear is imposed on the stomach.‘

Further down South, Spitﬁre and Bishop's
Finger, two light lagers which look red as
Hell and one's head feels that way after
drinking two of them. ‘
Just because the United States won

that blasted War of Independence, doesn't.

mean that American beer is better. British
beer is rich, like its culture. The English
brought Shakespeare, Dickens Milton.
Who does America have? Danielle Steel
and Judith Krantz. Though I'll admit
America has some good authors such as
Wrlliarn Gaddis, Walt Whitman and Kurt
Vonnegut, and England unleashed the
wrinkledtrampJoanCollins,andherhalf-
wit sister Jackie, I will not admit that
AmericanbeerisbetterthantheBritish
brew!

I could go on forever about the aes-
thetics of British beer, but I am vexed by
the endless propagandafrom the American
beercompanies claimingthattheirbrewis
better than their European counterparts.
Not only is that a lie, for which there
should be some law, but it's below the belt
and a tactic used by Californian sparkling

wine manufacturers who try to spruce up
their product by calling it champagne. Do
not believe the lie — champagne only
comes from the Champagne region of

.already, homosexuals are deviant, hold

secret agendas, have an average of 500
lovers intheir lifetime, and by the way, I'm
a good beer. "

Now if Americans apparently don't
drink these beers for their ﬂavor, and there
isn't a sporting event to view on the televi-
sion, what would be the point of drinking
this watered-down sludge? If it's the case
of columnist Marc Nuzzo, then it will be
the production of hyperbole. Sniff his
counterpoint! Does it not smell like a Bud
Lite? , ‘

If it's inebriation they're after, then
why not consume malt liquor? It's a shame
to see malt liquor fall into the category of
"ghetto juice" in America, seeing as it pro-
duces some ﬁne brands. The buzz one
receives by a 40-oz bottle of St. Ides can-
not be equalled by any other lofty brew.
VV1th malt liquor, ﬂavor really doesn't mat-
ter, because one looking for this buzz. One
does ‘not drink Miller Lite for inebriation;
one drinks Schlitz (the 24-02. Master
Cylinder) and Olde English 800 (24 oz. of
charcoal ﬁltered chemical ﬂavor) for that

 

 

experience.

But if it's ﬂavor you want, accept no
substitute — drink British beer. British
beer has the ﬂavor which the watery opiate
oftheAmericanmassesdoesnot. Butfor
those who still think that patriotism is the
only reason why they should buy beer,’
there's no hope at all. E

James Maude ﬁnds short aspiring hwyers
whose last name sounds like that of a
Muppet character to be very annoying.

As if winning the war for American
independence wasn’t enough, now we —— as
an established nation of beer drinkers, ine-

as their primary sources of entertainment to

that we Americans simply brew our batches
of bitters and barley better.

It is hard to compete with American
beer for a handful of reasons: It’s aﬁordable,
accessible and asking for anything else in
many places will result in a burly man
named Cletus quickly relocating several of
your body parts to other states. Coupled with
the fact that thousands of independent
rnicrobreweries are popping up around the
country that can produce beers with any taste

Historically, we are a nation founded on
the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the
pursuit of beer. Back around 1722, our fore-
father Samuel Adams did several things that
shaped our nation. Obviously, he helped
inspire a rag-tag nation of unstructured and
disorganized castaways into a ﬁghting force
that eventually conquered the world’s most
pervasive superpower. But, more important-

It’s a little known historical fact that

sober these guys up. Cllris is about the time
that Sammy was rnisquoted when he said
“Give me liberty, or give me a [expletive]
beer and no one dies.”) ’

The king didn’t listen. We got our guns
and defended our beer. The rest is history.

\V1thout beer, our nation really had no
leg to stand on. VV1th it, standing on those
two legs or lying face down in a pile of puke
and excrement was at least a choice we
could make for ourselves. The war of
American independence led to the freedom
of speech, the freedom to practice whatever
religion we wanted to, and the freedom to
pee anywhere we wanted at 2 am (for
awhile, at least).

Unfortunately, the biggest beer names
to come out of Britain these days sound
more like pornographic movie stars than
beverages. ‘With names like “Bishop
Fingers,’.’ Thomas Hardy’s,”, “John
Courage” and “Old Peculiar,” you’ve got to
wonder exactly what it is that they have been
drinking over there. (Those, frighteningly
enough, are real beer names.)

“Double Diamond,” sounds more like a
ski attraction than a stout and “Bass” is a
shoe, notabrew. “Whitbread” is aboatrace
that the Americans ﬁeld better teams at than
the Brits (get over it) and “Old Speckled
Hen” sounds like a kind of Easter candy.

What also makes our beers better are
their collateral effects.

What other nation has educated three
frogs to chant “Bud,” “Weis” and “Er” in
unison? Among other notable feats, we have
also successfully taught a case of Bud Light

and Budweiser to play professional sports,

turnedtheswedishbikiniteamintoan
American national icon, shown facial con-
tortioniststhattheytoocanbeausefulpart
of our society, and encouraged parents to tell
their twentysomething children that they
should learn independence.

And Mr. Maude dares to challenge our
global dominance? I don’t care what you
say, you’re still not getting me to give up my

The average case of domestic beer is
$14. The average can of British beer costs
the same. Why encourage an economy that
brought us such wonders as Elton John and
the man who eventually led Yoko Ono to
produce her own album?

You shouldn’t.

Instead, support our own strange brews.

How to make Pitt a much more fun - and safe! - place to learn

Rehan Nasir

Photo Editor

Although I try to avoid it as
much as possible, I ﬁnd myself
spending more and more time in
the Viﬁlliam Pitt Union. I also
ﬁnd myself discovering various
shortcomings of the building and
what it has to offer. So, here are
a few changes I'd like to see.

First, tunnels. One that runs
from the Union to both the
Cathedral‘ and The Quad. This
way, Unioners can forego having
to deal with bothersome
Bigelow Boulevard trafﬁc and
even more bothersome sales pro-
moters. Dealing with the hourly
changing weather could be done
away with altogether. What's that
you say, tunnels getting dirty?
Simple solution: daily early
morning ﬂooding. This would
do away with vermin and dis-
courage any student "high jinx"
at night. The fraternities would
even beneﬁt from the implemen-
tation of a tunnel system. The lit-
tle pledges could scurry through
a gauntlet from Cathedral to
Towers.

Second, a rooftop cafe
would be a nice touch. Are they
hiding something on the roof?
There's nothing special on there
now, so why not add something
special? A little eatery? Perfect.
The sandwiches could be named
after various organizations found
in the Union. For instance, the

ly placed
foam mattresses. After some
adjustment, this "crutch" can be
removed and thus the whole
process will become more efﬁ-
cient. Why bother with the ele-
vators or worry about stair eti-
quette? (Stair etiquette is having
to put up with slow people who

priately marked window, leap

"Firepole Darwinism." That is,

"the system. Those in casts and

court will be discouraged and
forced to return to the archaic
elevators.

Fourth, the Union should
provide paintball equipment. In
the late hours of the morning,
when the tunnels are ﬂooded,
Unioners need a fun activity to
pass the time. Paintballing is the
happiest solution: 1) Give out
guns/arnrno. 2) Pick "cops." 3)
Pick "robbers" 4) Kill-lights 5)
Kill co-workers.

Lastly, the Union operators
should provide Slip and Slides to
any organization that asks for
them. I'm not saying that they
have to provide the water,
bathing suits or squirt guns as
well, no, no, no. Just provide the
Slip and Slide and we'll ﬁgure
out the rest. And who says that
you have to use water? One
word, three qualities: glycerin,
slippery and sweet. Feel hard-
core? Feel the 10—W-40. And in
the dead of winter, lighting up
the Quaker State Slip and Slide
could provide not only fun and
excitement, but warmth. Slip and
Slide bowling is even a possibil-

C ity. Don't know what to do with

all of those old iced—tea bottles?
1) Line up bottles. 2) Grease self.
3) Bowl self. ‘
Yes, the Union is working
nicely for the students now, but
who can possibly predict the
future? What if other schools
beat us in making these sanity-
saving improvements? Tours

‘Ricketts’ March 30 letter in The Pitt

misleading propaganda." Ricketts
implies that we are trying to damage
the reputation of the Pittsburgh

facts.-

The object of criticism in this
letter are the two words "Pittsburgh

was not capitalized on the original
poster as it was in Ricketts‘ letter.)
Ricketts correctly points out that the
Pittsburgh Police Department was
not involved in Gross‘ case —-— but
the text of the ﬂyer, as well as the
capitalization, indicates that blame

to the "Pittsburgh Police

that the police are divided into.

The point was much more sim-
ple and straightforward -—- the
police in and around the city of
Pittsburgh ("Pittsburgh police"),
whatever department they may be
in, are responsible for the brutal
handling of citizens. This is not
some sort of devious propaganda
fabricated by the ISO, but is, unfor-
tunately, a fact.

Lenwill: Pitt
memories and
loads of thanks

Where I’m going  and where. I’ve
been! A ‘ _

Wow, I can’t believe I’m ﬁnishing up
the year I spent with The Pitt News. It’s gone
by so quickly, but it has been the most ﬁm -
and fulﬁlling year I have ever spent in one.
place.

Because I worked with The Pitt News,
I have sat in 20-degree weather to cover a
November football practice.

I have travelled across the state in a van
ﬁlled with smelly equipment and giddy Pitt
hockey players.

I have been ﬂashed by various profes-
sional athletes (and I want to say to all of
them, “Well, it looks sort of like ...” uh,
never mind). I have done J ell-o shots with a
certain departing editor whom I carmot
mention.

I don’t know where I’ll be in a few
months, but right now I’m working in

 

V Monroeville with the Norwin Star as its res-

ident sports babe. A

I will be somewhere -— I assure you
that —— and I will be repaying my college
loans and credit cards but I know this for
certain: I won’t have to ride the damned bus
anymore becﬂg I ﬁnally bought a car!

But I will dearly remember the time I
spent here in Oakland, especially the great
football memories: the football team’s 17-
16 heartbreaker loss to Miami m 1995, and
the Panthers’ rebound win over the
 this past Homecoming. I think I
got hit on th.6 head with the goalpost that
night -

Watching Notre Dame play Pitt was a
thrill as well, although watching Pitt get
devastated was kind of heart-wrenching.
Too bad I couldn’t throw a paper airplane on
the ﬁeld from the press box.

And on a more personal level, I will
value all of the interviewing experience I
received. Like the time I woke up Pitt track
star/All-American/Bionic Woman Trwia
Smith to interview her. Or when I had to
chase down Duquesne women’s basketball

‘star Korie Hlede after she devastated the

Lady Panthers with her deadly three-point-
ers. And what about the time that Ricardo
Greer didn’t even show up for my interview
request? Talk about being at the mercy of
the athletes  _

But seriously folks, I am going to miss
The Pitt News, and when I say that I want to
take the whole staff with me wherever I go
next, I truly mean it I hate to leave behind a
staff like this one, and I worry sometimes
that I might not ever ﬁnd another stalf like it.

Pitt, Dukes battle o a lie

Patrick Robertson

scoring three runs off a single, a

i the game after his rocky third.

Staff Wrlter

The Pitt baseball team went down
by three runs early, but came back to
finish its afternoon game in a rare
tie, 5-5, with Duquesne yester-
day.

The Dukes jumped out to an
early 1-0 lead in the first inning
on two hits and one Panther error.
Pittsburgh fought back to tie the
game on a Dukes error.

Duquesne pushed its lead to
4-1‘ in the bottom of the third,

Lou Melucci error and two dou-
bles. The offensive /display
prompted a Panther reliever to
trot to the bullpen, but he was not
used in this inning.

Pitt starter Greg Paul got the
Dukes’ Bernie Weber to pop up to 
end the threat and remained in "

Pittsburgh fought back in the
top of the fourth inning, scoring 
three runs of its own. Bill Brown 
and Melucci walked to start the
inning, but were followed by two
ﬂyouts. Stephen Varshire walked,
as did Steve Dickinson, to force
in the second Panther run.

This brought Duquesne’s coach
to the mound to make a pitching
change. Facing a new hurler, Pitt’s
Ben Johnston snuck a grounder right
over second base and knocked in two

more runs to knot the game at four.
“These are the things we need to
do everyday to win,” Pitt Head Coach
Joe Jordano said of his offensive pro-
duction. '

   
   

Paul was victimized by fielding errors o uay.

For the defense, Panther fresh-
man Paul silenced the Dukes from the
fourth through five and one-third
innings. He gave up one earned run
on nine hits before being removed for
Scott Schultz in the sixth.

“Greg Paul did" a pretty good job.
He gave us a quality start,” Jordano
said.

The score stayed tied at four until v

the top of the seventh inning, when

the shortstop’s glove.

Melucci slapped a grounder
toward the shortstop, who
watched the ball glance off the
top of his glove and into the out-
field.’ Chris Delsignore, * who had
reached on a walk, came in to
score and give Pitt a 5-4 lead.

run of their own in the bottom of

U, the seventh. Josh Stahl singled

E to left, then Jed Fiscus sacrificed

'° him over to second. Will
Swisher doubled into the left
field gap and Stahl came around
to score.

The Panthers had a man on
base in both the eighth and ninth
innings, but they could not capi-
talize, leaving both men on sec-
ond after sacrifice bunts.

The Dukes got two men on in
the bottom of the ninth off
Schultz, but Jory Coughenour
came -in to shut the door, leaving
both men on base.

The umpires discussed the condi-
tions and decided to call the game
due to darkness at 7:30 p.m.

Pitt’s next contest is today at

Three Rivers Stadium versus West
Virginia. The game starts at 1 p.m.

teams were atthe mercy of the weath-
er last weekend. They competed in the
Sea Ray relays at the University of
Tennessee, and for the second consec-
utive meet, the weather was not con-
ducive to holding a track meet.
“Friday it was terrible,” said Pitt
Head Coach Steve Lewis. “It was cold
and windy. It was still competitive, but
it affected everybody’s performance.”
When Pitt did well, it was in spite

120 other schools representedfat the

performances in the 800,rneters.’
. Chantee Earl ﬁnished third in theevent _

in 2:06.65, currently the nation’7s’jsixth-
best time in the event. Tamika Dorin

was ninth in 2:10.81. J

The women also ran well in the
4x800-meter relay. The Panthers’ team
of Joetta Purter, Anna Kohler, Dorin
and Earl won the; event by a comfort-
able 7—second margin over second-

place Cornell, ifinishingwith a time of;

8:43.64 —— a new school record. That
time also places them. among. the
nation’s fastest 4x800-meter teams.
“They were really not challenged
at any time during the race, on any

“leg,” said Coach Lewis.

The only other member of Pitt’s

squad to turn in a ﬁrst-place perfor-

mance was Trecia Smith, as usual.
Smith won the long jump, going 20-
1/4 feet into a slight breeze. . ’
‘ One new ngrne among Pitt’s lead

sixth in the javelin with a throw of

team of Jeremy Ward, Sekou Dilday,
Tim Tyre and Carl Taylor ﬁnished sec-

in one of the meet’s closest races.

“Those men had a fantastic race,”
said Lewis. “We led all the way, and
Kentucky’s guy came from behind and
just nicked Carl at the end.”

Individually, Dilday had his best
400—meter time of the season, 48.06

One minute, Dr. Ronald Brown strate-
 gizes with a frustrated athlete a for way to
;0VCI'COlTlC the atl1lete’s instructor refusing to
 allow her to travel to her next event.

Before he can get out more than two
words, the phone rings with a former student
requesting a recommendation for law
school.

“It’s in the mail,” said Brown.

Before you know it the instructor of the
athlete calls to discuss the ath1ete’s missing
class due to athletic events. Understanding
rthat he isthe bridge between academics and
athletics, Brown smoothly convinces the
’.athlete’s instructor to allow her to go to her
next event without penalizing her grade.

This is how Brown’s days go.

Brown, the director of academic sup-
:port services for student athletes, is always
willing to help those who are in need and
«those who want to help themselves.
According to Tim T‘yre, a junior track ath-
lete, Brown “prepares student athletes for the
outside world through networking and
teaching students how to carry themselves
accordingly,”

According to Trecia Smith — another
itrack athlete, one with a ﬁstful of All-
America awards — Brown helps and

a encourages students to get involved in com-
rnunity service, teaches students the impor-
stance of networking with others outside of
:their nuclear community, and advises people
on career goals.

“Dr. Brown does his job beyond what
the has to do,” said Smith. “Ninety percent of
my decision to come to Pitt was based on
«what Dr.‘ Brown presented to me about aca-
adernics here at the University. Ten percent
was athletics.”

Brown is also assistant to the vice

provost for academic alfairs, and holds the
title of assistant athletics director for being
head of the academic program for student
athletes.

This is a man who has corrre a long way
from a small town in Oklahoma

Brown, the second of four children,
grew up in Pawhuska, Okla., and was raised
with his brother by his father and grand-
mother. The brothers were separated from
their two younger sisters at a very young
age, when their parents separated due to
gambling and alcohol abuse from his father.
One sister would later die of drug addiction.

Trying to understand what made up his
personality, one would only have to inquire

about his youth and how he grew up.

His father had the best job a black per-
son could have in that town at that time — a
chef at a country club.

“Most of the other blacks in the town
were either farmers or shoe-shine boys,”
said Brown.

Outside of being a chef, Brown’s father
was also a professional gambler who played
cards and shot dice for a living.

Brown’s grandmother -— with whom
he lived for much of his youth — was a
bootlegger, someone who sold moonshine
after hours in her house. The most
respectable people in town — bankers, busi-
ness owners and the like -— would come to
his grandrnother’s house to get some of her
whiskey.

“I can remember hiding the liquor when
the authorities would come around the
neighborhood,” said Brown.

Brown entered the ﬁrst grade at the age
of four. His brother who was older bad start-
ed school ahead of him, leaving Brown at
home by himself. “I felt left out and wanted
to go with my big brother.” said Brown.
“One morning before my brother went to
school, I woke up and got dressed with him.

went to an integrated high school. While in
grade school, Brown was disturbed by the
fact that the students at his school had to use
hand—me-down schoolbooks ﬁ'om the white
schools.

“That bothered me a lot because I want-
ed to read and do well in school, but when I
would turn to the next page, it would be
missing.”

Although pages would be missing out
of textbooks, Brown still read what was
given to him and more. But sometimes even
going to the library was hard for Brown ——
during that time, blacks could only go to the
library two nights out of a week.

Between second and eighth grade‘,
though he was younger than his classmates,
Brown played basketball for his school
team. They never lost a game. In high school
he kept up with basketball, becoming a
steady contributor to a state’-champion
squad. a
Brown graduated from high school at
16, then entered Oklahoma City College,
where he devel-
oped academi-
cally and athleti-
cally. He partici-

While in the Air Force, Brown was a
local celebrity. People were naturally drawn

get their lives together after they were ﬁn-
ished in the  Brown ﬁnished his time
in the Air Force in 1979. He then had an
opportunity to attend the camp for the
Kansas City (now Sacramento) Kings.
Brown turned down the opportunity because
at the time he had started teaching and was
working on his masters degree.

During his time in college and in theAir
Force, Brown saw a lot of wasted youth and
talent. Having seen so many of his class-
mates fall to crime and drugs — because, he
reasoned, they lacked other opportunities —
Brown took on the challenge of making a
difference through sports. I

“I hate to see potential wasted I have
always wanted to be involved in helping

people,” said Brown.

Brown’s career has develo greatly in
college athletics. -

From 1981-85, Brown coached men’s
basketball at Northern Oklahoma College (a
team that included current New York Knick
John Starks).

Brown stopped coaching in 1985 so
that he could get his professional career of
helping students started. Later in 1985, he
was an athletic counselor at Oklahoma State
University while he worked on a Ph.D. in
education with a specialty in higher eduction
administration.

Three years later, he became director of
athletic counseling for Oklahoma State,
where he stayed for three years before mov-
ing to Pittsburgh.

Brown saw the University of Pittsburgh
as a challenge. After seeing the poor reten-
tion rate and academic status of within ath-
letics, he felt conﬁdent that he could turn the
program around and make a difference.

According to Brown, the three titles he
holds mean he must simply manage the

The initial buzz of excitement sur-

rounding the armouncement of Pitt’s new
convocation center has died down, but
behind the scenes, Athletics Director Steve
Pederson and his staff are diligently work-
ing on planning the massive building.

“The planning’s going well. We’re
progressing on schedule,” Pederson said.
“Right now We’re involved in the architect
selection process.”

Selecting the architect is a huge step in

million of that comes from the money Gov.
Tom Ridge committed to the project, and
the remaining $17 million or so will come

from other University and private sources. .

Pederson explained that much of that
money could come ﬁom selling the build-
ing’s naming rights to a corporation and
from other marketing and advertising
throughout the arena. He said negotiations
have begun with some companies.
Pederson added that the talks are very pre-
 andthatitis fartoo earlytoname
the bidders. \ p

-According to the A.D., Pitt’s convoca-
tion center is expected to hold about 12,000
people. _

Pederson explained that more research
needs to be done to come up with an opti-
mal seating capacity.

“[That] is an. important issue,” he ’

noted. “We don’t want to make it too small,
but we also don’t want to make it toobig.”

The architect and Pederson will iron
out other details, including whether to
include parking, because the structure will
eliminate a substantial amount of Pitt’s
already limited parking capacity.

They also will determine the total ﬂoor
space available in the building because the
NCAA requires certain amount for some

A national and regional events. For example,

a building must have room for eightregu-
lation-size mats to host the NCAA
wrestling championships.

  

“Our timetable all along has been three
years —— year of planning and two years to

build it,” Pederson said of his plans to have ‘

the arena open for the start of the 2001 bas-
ketball season. “We’re ready to start really
moving on it. We want some speciﬁcs
[from the architectural candidates], more
than just conceptual drawings.”

While the opening of new basketball I
arenas at other universities — such as Penn .
State’s Bryce Jordan Center — has made it i

even more necessary for Pitt to escape the
aging Fitzgerald Field House, Pederson
said Pitt’s center will not closely resemble

struction at Texas Tech.

The new arena doesn’t just mean a bet-
ter facility for Pitt’s basketball teams; with
them out of the ﬁeld house, it will be reno-
vated for the volleyball, wrestling, and
gyrrmastics teams, perhaps by putting blue
seats all the way around the gym

“We want to make it into a smaller:
gym, so it’ll be a great place to wrestle, play

. volleyball, or have a gymnastics meet,” he

said.

The University will also use the'con—
vocation center for nonsporting events such
as graduation ceremonies and major con-
certs. Pitt lacks such a facility compared to
other universities its size.

Pederson admitted that all of Pitt’s ath—
letic facilities need some work and that this
is just the ﬁrst major step toward improving
them.

The University hopes to transform
Mazeroski Field into a softball ﬁeld and to
upgrade Trees Field.

Long-range possibilities for Trees-
Field include renovating the baseball ﬁeld,
or turning the area into an AstroTurf soccer
ﬁeld and relocating the baseball squad.

This would permit natural grass to be
planted in Pitt Stadium. It is not possible to
have grass in the stadium at present
because of the heavy use of the ﬁeld by the
football team, the men’s and women’s soc-
cer teams, the band, the lacrosse team and
intramural events.

resources, stall", and administration of all
programs dealing with academic and per-
sonal development needs of student athletes.

Though his duties sound mostly admin-
istrative, Brown is always willing and ready
to help steer someone into the right direc-
tion, career—wise and academically.

“Here at the University of Pittsburgh,
every athlete has the best opportunity to suc-

FROM PAGE 13

ceed. No one can say that the University has .

not committed the support and resources
necessary for student athletes to become a
success,” said Brown.

Smith’s and Tyre’s stories aren’t the
only testimonials.

 Brown sat and talked with me
throughout my ﬁrst year and half of my sec-
ond year to help me ﬁgure out what kind of
career I wanted to have and my career
goals,” said Farrah Woods, senior graphics
design major and Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball player.

Brown has been recognized for giving
this kind of help, earning citations from the
House of Representatives in Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom -Ridge and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as
being one of the ﬁrst recipients of the
Cl1ancellor’s Award for Excellence by statf

employees at Pitt. All of these awards were-

in recognition of his work with youth and
the community.

“I’m not in it for the material awards,”
said Brown. “It is about trying to make a dif-
ference.”

“They owe it to the community and
society at large to help and instill positive
things into the younger generation.” .

Since he has been in Pittsburgh, Brown
has taken on the task of helping and reach-
ing out to the youth within his own neigh-
borhood. He helps those who may not nec-
essarily have positive male role models in
their lives, giving them access to opportuni-
ties they may not have at home.

“I want to share with them what it is I
have access to,” Brown said. He said he
wants to share his knowledge and under-
standing. “I want to help them sort out the
confusion in their lives that comes from
school, family, peer pressure, et ceteia,” said
Brown. For the past three years, Brown has
taken a busload of kids from his communi-
ty to see a Cleveland Cavaliers game.

Brown said that a person really has to
care about people to be involved in the ath-
letic and academic business. Coming to Pitt
was a challenge for him to make a differ-
ence in the athletic program

Though Brown has given up participat-
ing in sports competitively, he still enjoys
refereeing for high schools and junior col-
leges throughout western Pennsylvania. He
also loves to ﬁsh and enjoys golf.

“It is amazing for me to look back and
seethatlhavebeenabletomaintainand
overcome self destruction due to my envi-
ronment,” said Brown. “If I were to retire
right now, I feel that I have done my share in
making a difference, but I’m not done yet. I
will continue to try and help young people
realize their potential and opportunity
through sports and education.”
