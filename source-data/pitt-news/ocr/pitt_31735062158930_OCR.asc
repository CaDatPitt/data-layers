"This really started: some weeks.
ago,”  the _t‘ea.c.‘her in an in-
 vki’it.li‘i"t.lie"press..

“David; A the instigator of the
strike, had ‘been’ "working on a
painting which represented a cross-
section of the‘ earth. He wanted
an. extra activity hour in which
to work on his project.“**- "

This meant giving it to the en-
tire class,‘ and I didn’t feel that
the class as  whole had a project
under way which would have jus-
tiﬁed this extra hour. I also felt
that they were not keeping up to
their work, but were spending too
much time in idle visiting. So I
1'efused their. demands.” 4

Successful Agitator
Accordingto the teacher, David
agitated the cause among his
friends; succeeded. in getting two
others, Johnnie and «Bobbie, to ally
themselves with him. on a set
day, these three announced they
would go on a sit-down strike to
secure their. demands. The teacher
assured them that it was all right,

if they would sit down‘ and keep, A’

quiet. ; . t _ V

Then the three decided that
picketing would be more effective
and so t.hey7r'narched up and down
the back of the ---«room for about
ﬁfteen minutes, until the‘ lunch-
hour "bell rang. « ~

By this time, the entire class had

entered into thespirit of the thing,

and during the time that the relief
teacher was in the room, (the reg-
ular teacher had gone out to
lunch), the.stAudentsA made posters
citing their demands, and began to
carry sa—ndwicAh boards with such
legends as “T00, T00 Unfair.”

For High ‘Wages
1 Suited To Ability

Engineers should join the CIO
and obtain higher pay and short-
er hours—-this was the challenge
hurled at the mechanic and aer-
onautical engineers last Thursday
in their joint seminar meeting, by
Edward Jacoby, representative of
a C10 union for technical ‘em-
ployees. ‘

Jacoby, a civil engineer and
graduate of Brooklyn Polytechnic
Institute, gave as the full name
of his union the Federation of
Architects, Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians. Only recently,
he said, has it become affiliated
with the Committee for Industrial
Organization. '

LAUDS ENGINEERS

“You engineers,” he dramatic-
ally declared, “are the
America's productive resources.
Your ingenuity has helped’ build
our country. Your skill makes
life easier for all people.”

He pointed out, however, that
engineers all too often are being
paid much less than the men out
in the shops who carry out the
creations of the engineers, and
that these common workers also
work shorter hours for greater

key to

pay———all because they are organ-
ized by the CIO. .
“The-FAECT is recognized as
the union for technical employees
and has the respect of all engi-
neers and is highly ‘respected’ by
your employers,” Jacobygsaid. He
added that dozens of offices in pri-
vate industry are now completely
organized through the: efforts of
the engineers’ union. AA A
LAUDS FAECT ,
The FAECT will ﬁghtfor a’ 30-
hour week for all en‘gine‘ers’ and
technicians and for salaries that
are in keepingwith their ability,
college training, and high value
to their respective companies, the
declared. The union will also ad-
vocate, help in fo1*mulating,V and
support legislation for patent pro-
tection against employment ‘con-
tracts which force the AAeng.ineer Ito

; waive all rights to his inventions.

He dismissed themany charges
against the CIO for coercing em-
ployees to join the union for not
keeping faith with employers and
other charges by saying thatgthe
newspapers are published _by the
capitalists of the country. These
men are stockholders in many of
the companies involved in dis-
putes, and therefore anything
they say will be biased and en-
tirely an incorrect picture of the
situation, he said.

not beg'un"as _a. publicity stui1t’;‘__ and 

which, deep in the minds of those fouitlh

grade 7 kiddies, was begun to remedy -a._.

real wrong.
The youngsters, or more particularly
«one youngster, David, was doing a re-
xsearcli job which Was, to him, the most

_'jin1po1“ta11t thing in the world at that
.' moment. He found that he couldn’t do
the Work justice without an extra hour

to probe the carth’s sllifts.

And so, not" being able to gain his
point by explainiiig his difficulties to
the teacher, he cliairmanned a commit-
tee of three which instituted a strike
ﬁnally involving the entire class.

He and the class Won the. point.

Miss Barnes, in reporting the story
to us, said that the teacher was wor-
ried, did not want her name connected
with the.-.st'ory. Further, the story re-
ports that the teacher told her fourth
graders that they did not gain their
point because of the strike, but because
they were willing to talk over the situ-

.ation.

It is our opinion that the teacher
made mistakes in two points. First of
all, far from being afraid of the pub-
licity, she should have been proud of
her youngsters, proud that she teaches
them, and proud that she so effectively
settled the strike by submitting‘ to
their reasonable demands.

Secoml, how does she figure that the
