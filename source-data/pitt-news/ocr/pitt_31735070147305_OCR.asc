Port Authority contemplates service outs  

Services could be cut by -between 15 and 35 percent in light of a $47 million-budget deﬁcit. Pitt students safe from fee increase.

Tegan Hanlon
Staff Writer

Port Authority still intends to cut
transit service — the question now
seems to be by how much.

’ Jim Ritchie, Port Authority
Director of Public Relations, said
the Port Authority will either cut
service by 35 percent in the next
few months or make a smaller cut
— somewhere around 15 percent
— at a meeting Wednesday. The
Authority is deciding how to allo-
cate $45 million in federal funding
that Gov. Ed Rendell found to avoid
the 35 percent service cut.

The authority has not ﬁnalized
the plans for the potential 15 per-
cent service cut, so how much it
might affect Pitt students -is still
unclear.

“The staff is doing a lot of num-

ber crunching and route scenarios ,

to come up with the best proposal
that will be taken to the board,”
said Ritchie. “They could vote to
continue with the plan that’s al-

   

ready in place or adopt the pro-
posal we put in front of them.”
For the past several years, state
budgets — hurt by the state of the
economy — have had little to spare
for local transit authorities. The
Port Authority in Pittsburgh now

Jim Ritchie:

cism from a number of parties,

_ including the local organization

of transit users, known as the Al-

legheny County Transit Council. .

dent of the organization, is push-
ing for all of the money to be spent

The $45 million is very

faces the decision of what bus ser-
vice to cut and where. h
By law, the Southwestern Penn-
sylvania Commission, a regional
planning committee, had to sign
off on the $45 million. The com-
mission approved the funding

under the condition that the Port ’

Authority would stretch it out as
long as possible, said Ritchie.
The proposal has drawn criti-

before the ﬁscal year is up onjune
30.

Robison believes that making
the cuts will display to the com-
mission that theimoney was not
needed and will be detrimental to
low-income neighborhoods.

The 35-percent serviceplan
cut was approved in November to
be enacted in March by the Port
Authority to offset a $47 million

budget deﬁcit. .

The original cut would include
reducing service on routes heav-
ily traveled by students. The 71A,
71C, 71D to Shadyside, the 61D to

_ the Waterfront, the 61A to ‘Squir-
rel Hill and the 54CVto the South P

Side would experience reduced
service.

In regards to Pitt students, Ro-
bison said that “prepaid bus ser-
vices doesn’t give you anything if
there are not any buses. Atexistent
.routes you will have to.wait longer
and buses are likely to be full.”

The cuts will also come with
increases in fares, Robinson re-
ported. However, Pitt spokesman
John Fedele said that students will
not experience an increase in tu-
ition or transportation fees as a
result of cuts.

“There is no need for student
fee increases in the near future.
Once Port Authority has the smart
card put on all transportation we
will review this. However, that is
still a ways away,” Fedele said.

GOT WORK STUDY "n-us SPN

Despite the one-time transfu-
sion of funds, Rendell’s ﬁx is not
a cure-all unless the state ﬁxes its
funding laws, said Ritchie.

“The $45 million is very wel-
comed, but it does not ﬁx every-
thing forever. It is short-term, so

- the cuts don’t have to hit the ‘com-

munity so hard,” said Ritchie.

If Port Authority does not make
any cuts now and the state does
not ﬁx its funding, the 35 percent
cuts will happen in the summer,
said Ritchie. - .

“There is no dedicated stream
of money in the state that funds
transportation,” said Ken Wolfe,"
State Rep.]ake Wheatley’s legisla-
tive aide. “That is the problem.”

The money provided by Ren-
dell is available from a buildup of
the yearly $25 million set aside by
the federal transportation depart-
ment for the governor to use on
transportation projects, accord-
ing to PennDOT spokesman Steve
Chizmar. .

  Opinions

Let them leak

As much as we all love Facebook,
it’s very clear that some shady
stuff goes down on the social
networking site. From photos of

. underage drinking to ever—so-

disturbing promiscuous photos

. of 14-year-old girls and cyber ‘
bullying, the website has its fair

share of drama.

But recently, Facebook took
action against a seemingly in-
nocent group called “The Leaky
B@@b” — an online breastfeed-
ing support group with about

‘ 5,000 members. According to

Parenting.com, Facebook de-
leted and reinstated the group
multiple times, in addition.to
deleting a group formed in the
response to the group’s removal.
“Facebook claimed that it had
violated their Terms of Service,
insinuating that breastfeeding
photos posted on the group’s

page were obscene,” Parenting.

com reported.

Though we don’t think Face-
book is against breastfeeding like
the article suggests, we feel like
the website appears to be try-
ing to improve its image through
removing content that might be
considered explicit.

The familiar debate of wheth-
er or not it’s okay to breastfeed in
public has moved online. B

Is it okay to consider provid-
ing nourishment toan infant ob-
scene? Especially with so many
other inappropriate and law-
breaking things one can ﬁnd on
"the website?

Although we acknowledge that .

some do not think breastfeeding
in public is acceptable, these in-
dividuals would not randomly
stumble’ across the content un-

less they speciﬁcally searched
for it. 0
In addition, the group did not

"exist -merely to display raunchy

images, but instead to provide
important information and sup-
port to nursing mothers. Accord-
ing to Parenting.com, “The Leaky
B@@b” is important because it
offers “support for nursing moms
around the clock, whereverthey

are” and is useful when one can— ' ,

not contact a pediatrician.
Although students might not

agree that our mothers should

be on Facebook to begin with,

we must keep in mind that even 4

people our age and younger are
becoming mothers now. Our gen-
eration is becoming more and
more accustomed to getting news
and other information from so-
cial media sources, sqis it really
a surprise that users now expect
and demand lactation support via
social media as well?

Though it seems reasonable
that Facebook should be allowed
to delete what it wants, the fact

that it reinstated the group after ‘

its removal caused such a strong
reaction — including support
groups with more than 10,000
fans — shows that the site cares
at least somewhat‘ about the con-
tent its users wish to access.
We hope in the future that
the social media giant chooses
to moderate actual explicit con-
tent and not an act of infant
nourishment that is speciﬁcally
allowed in any public or private
location in 44 states, according
to the National Conference of
State Leg.islatures.,After all,

we’ve got bigger problems than '

leaky boobs. I

We’ve got a lot of nerve.

THE STAMATIACK

Debunking

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

January is miserable.
,You don’t need The Pitt News
to tell you that, though. Starting a

conversation with anybody on the '

street this time ofyearwill inevitably
lead to the same banter about how
slowly this time of the year travels
and how generally miserable every-
body seems. '

But if it makes. you feel better,

‘these feelings don’t just stem from

having a rather depressing set of
friends. In 2005, CliffArnall, a psy-
chologist from Cardiff University,
actually created an equation involv-

ing many of the things that make.

this time of the year so difﬁcult —-
lingering debt from the holidays,

the weather, lack of motivation, ’

failed New Year's resolutions —-— and
found that every New Year leads to
a general increase in melancholy
culminating on a speciﬁc day into

a single, miserable juggernaut of

depression.
And for this year, the big winner

isjan. 24, the fourth Monday of the
month. This is the most depressing
day of the year.

But before you relegate yourself
to your room for reruns of “Law and
Order: SVU” to try to cope, the whole
Pitt campus needs to take this dreary
day, termed “Blue Monday,” and re-
alize it isn’t very accurate.

It’s actually a lot worse. The year
is actually more of a mineﬁeld with
scientiﬁcally designated depression
areas ready to ﬂare up at anymo-
ment. ‘

For one, Mondays aren’t even the

most depressing day of the week. As ‘

part of a study released in 2010, The
London School of Economics asked
study subjects to regularly indicate
their moods via iPhone and found
Tuesdays to be the most depress-
ing day of the week. The weekend’s
positive effects no longer linger, and
the next weekend seems more like a
mirage than a reachable goal.

So maybe two days actually re-
quire extra doses of SVU. Jan. 25
might be just as bad asjan. 24. Blue
Monday might actually be followed
by Gray Tuesday. ' ,

“Blue Monday”

But to complicate things ﬁuther,
there is a possibility we are in the
completely wrong part of the year
to even be havingthis conversation
.— because while the Blue Monday
equation makes logical sense, there
is no data to support its existence.

’ Other data shows, rather, that
the most depressing time of the year
occurs‘ right before Thanksgiving.
Bill Tancer, of the Internet track-
ing service Hitwise, notes that in-
temet searches for anti-depression
medications peak around this time,
whereasjanuary actually sees a drop
in searches. The theory here is that
holiday stress and similarly nasty
weather cause anxiety and fear, a
more potent brew for depression
than the pure singular dreariness
ofjanuary.

Finally, given the huge effect
relationships have on our personal
happiness, it makes sense that a
time preceding breakups would be
particularly depressing. Weeks of
second-guessing, nervous silences
and apprehension about the future
can easily wear a person down.

January is actually not the most miserable of the months

Stamatakis < 5 .

Of course, Facebook gives us the
ability to track breakups. But sadly
for our theory, the most breakups
tend to occur at the beginning of

' March and in the middle of Decem-

ber. This makes the days leading up
to Spring and Winter breaks the
most depressing of the year. ‘
With so many great days to feel
depression throughout the year, the
choices can be dizzying. Different

interpretations of the data provide
many feasible options. There are
multiple months whose Tuesdays
might be playing proud host to the
most depressing day of the year.
Of course, it is clear that this dis-
cussion yields few useful truths. You
can try to line up your TiVos with
‘crime drama marathons in order
to combat a universally depressing
day, but in reality, a singular day of _
depression probably doesn’t exist.

All this discussion shows is how
silly research and statistics can be
at times- _ I
- With computing power mak-
ing compiling statistics so simple
and technology tracking our daily
lives, we are nearing a point in time
at which there will be able to be a
study for any social or behavioral
topic. Although this can provide for
interesting conversation, it’s best
to not take any of it too seriously,

especially when the research leads to
oversimpliﬁcations of complicated,_
nuanced topics like depression.
Amall, whose research led to the
coining of Blue Monday, has actually

come to this conclusion in recent '

years, regretting his decision totry
to quantify the most depressing ,
day. At its best, after all, it’s a weak,
untestable theory, and at its worst,
it’s a damaging self-fulﬁlling proph-
ecy. Declaringaday most depressing

doesn’t help anybody and just leads
to people moping around, talking
about how depressing life seems.

I suppose, then, we’re right back
where we started.

January is miserable.

have been impressive if Oprah hadn’t
alreadybeen makingthe media rounds
and pimping OWN — the network’s
clever, self—empowering acronym —
out to everyone and anyone.
The network, which premiered
Jan. 1 and reaches 80 million house-
holds across the United States, hit the
airwaves like an open hand against a
slab of cheese. Though initially quite
successful -— 13 million tuned in dur-
ing the network’s ﬁrst days, and 1 mil-
lion alone on its ﬁrst night, according
to Reuters — viewership dwindled
faster than the droves of blackbirds
spiralingto their deaths across Arkan-
sas and Louisiana. Ratings were down
to just 321,000 by the night ofjan. 4,
according to data from Nielsen Co.,
and in the network’s target of women
25-54, OWN went from an opening

night rating of 0.6 to a0.2 atthe start
of the week, according to Entertain-
ment Weekly. .

The question here, of course, is
how? And, more importantly, why?
Have the American people forsakenall
that is good and coiffed in this world‘?
Do they no longer crave therapeutic

, gardening techniques andjohn Stein-

beck books? Is the sky even blue?
V Althoughthe haters conjectured
ﬁ'om the beginning that the network

would be too much — all Oprah, all '

the time — the project was received
warmly by critics. Alessandra Stanley
ofThe NewYorkTimes called it“aplace
where cynicism takes a holiday and
mockery hasn’t yet been invented.”
Even ole grumbly Bernie Gold-
berghad some kind words, admitting
that“what [Oprah’s] tryingto do here,
on this new network, is a very good

thing. She says  she wants a network ‘

with no cynicism, with no mean-spir-
itedness,” during an appearance on
“The O’Reilly Factor.”
Oprah, herself, was “delighted,”
with the network launch, accordingto
‘ Reuters, and claims she “can’t wait to.
" do itfull time.”

It would seem, then, that this
sanctuary from life’s’ cruel realities
is the perfect draw for Oprah’s usual
rriiddle—aged-soccer-moms—on—anti-

depressants demographic. And Lord
knows Discovery Communications, the
companythatownsthe network, mar-

ketedthecrapoutofit, orchestratinga -

series of “inspirational” promotional
trailers released throughoutthefall in
an attempt to get us all super—hyped.

Personally, I’m a fan of the one fea- A

turing an Auto-Timed gospel songas

According to the Associated
Press,allinall,DiscoveryCommunica-
tions shelled out $189 millionto launch
the network, which replaces the now-
deﬁmct Discovery Health Channel.
‘I’m a little displeased by the loss
of Discovery Health. If ’I’m no longer
able to watch specials on the “Tree
Man,” OWN better have some damn
good programming. V -
Most of this programming
unsurprisingly, is a showcasejof both
guest and topic staples from Oprah’s
soon-to-be-concluded daytime talk
show. ’ 1

“The Gayle King Show” — ac-
cordingto OWN’s website, Gayle “will
offer her unique perspective on an ar-
ray oftopics,”like nepotism andbeing
Oprah’s bestfriend. 7

‘Ask Oprah’s All Stars” —this,
to me, is the network gold mine. It
features not one, not two, but three
Oprah-made -“stars” _— it’s like the

_ , Oprahversion ofVH1s’s “I Love Mon-
ey.” Like moths to aﬂame, Dr. Mehmet

Oz, Suze Orrnan and Dr. Phil McGraw

and mental well-being.” In reality, I
viewthis showassomethingmorelike
“Survivor,” as the three battle it out
for the most air time to become the
kingorqueen of givingsanctimonious,
condescendingadvice. ‘ 

In additionto these high—quality -
shows, the network also occasionally
re-airs classic “menopausal-mom”
ﬁlms like “The Bridges of Madison
County,” which aired at 2:45 am. Sat-

-5 ‘urday,‘tomyclelight. ‘

Yet, it seems even asteady dosage
ofMerylSt1'eepis not enoughto sustain
OWN’s viewers. Perhaps the network
is aﬂing because, like me, people feel
there is something missing — some
essencethatfailedto transferfromthe
talk show to the network. Thus, I’ve

' compiled a small list of hypothetical

shows that I feel capture this essence

— shows that might revive the net- _

work’s ratings. ,

_ 1. A show that consists entirely
of Oprah ‘calling out celebrities’
names. “Rooobbbeerrrtttt Reeed—
dddfooorrrddd!”“Shannniiaaaahhhh
Twaaaiinn!” “SIR PAUL MCCARTIT—
NNEEEEYYYYYY!!!” Not only is this
classic Oprah, but it’s the type of show
that I could —~ and would — turn on
inthe background and listentoallday
as I loiter around myhouse.

2. An ’80s-inspired weekly ﬁt-
ness show — roller aerobics with
Stedman! Watch out for his catch
phrases “I date Oprah!” and “Look at
my moustache!”

L 3. A showfeatming Oprah’s hair.
It simply consists of video footage of
Oprah’s hair across the decades ac-
companiedbyasoundtrackofclassical
piano and electric guitar.

Exhibition

Opening reception Wednesday

Sometimes a change of place can be
tremendously helpful, both intel-
lectually and artistically. At least,
that’s the philosophy guiding Pitt’s
Studio Arts Wyoming Field Study
program. _ ‘

For several weeks during the
program, art students were in
contact with the geology, ecology
and archeology students who were
also on-site in Wyoming, as well as
other visiting facultyand students,
creating a think tank-esque envi-

-ronment; ’

An exhibit featuring the artwork
of the four studio arts students
who participated in the program
last summer — Ben Danforth, who
graduated last December; Ellyn
Womelsdorf, who graduated last
April; and current students Nick
Reynolds andlRob Hackett —— will
be on display from Jan.‘ 12 to Feb.
28.

Chair and associate profes-
sor in the studio arts department
Delanie Jenkins said both groups
beneﬁted from sharing meals and
living together.

“It’s nice to have that kind of
back-and—forth dialogue about ‘Oh,
what did you guys do today?”’Jen—
kins said. 4

The concept of having art stu-
dents work alongside science stu-
dents goes back to the beginning
of the Wyoming program. A Pitt
faculty member requested that his
son, a studio arts student at Yale,
be allowed to spend a few weeks

, on the site painting. ,

Ed McCord, director of pro-
gramming and special projects at
Pitt’s Honors College, said, “When
I saw that in action, that wonderful
young painter working alongside

“It’s Written in the Sky,” a painting by Ellyn Womelsdorf, is one of the pieces in the exhibition’s catalogue
— consisting of paintings, sculptures, photography and assorted other media — that draws upon images
students gathered in Wyoming.

our students of geology and ecol-

ogy, that just seemed like dynamite .

to me. It was a great reﬂection on
the synergy between arts and sci-
ence.”

The site’s facilities consist al-
most entirely of a dirt road and a
fence, but that’s hardly what the
students focus on. The 6,000 acres
of sage prairie offer a quarry of
dinosaur bones, 360 degrees of

art-inspiring sky and the opportu; ...

nity to interact with students from
all different disciplines.
“We were able to develop

' friendships with people we prob-

ably wouldn’t have ever crossed
[paths] with where our majors con-
ﬁne us in the University. It helped
to make my work better by having
people outside the art community
be able to contribute and give their
insight,” Reynolds said.
Womelsdorf affirmed the

strength of this pairing. »

“It was nice to get [science
students’] interpretation of your
work when they would visit the
studio, or to learn new things from
them when they returned from
their daily ﬁeld study. We all got
to share our different interests
and discover how the two worked
together in this experience,” Wom-
elsdorf said.

_ Jenkins said this sort of interac-
tion is one of the aims of the Hon-

ors College. 

“The thing about the Honors
College is that it isn’t discipline ’
speciﬁc. They like to be interdis-
ciplinary,” she said.

Similarly, the Wyoming Field

Study program is not media spe-V‘

ciﬁc: The exhibit will feature paint- l
ings, sculptures, photography,‘
drawings and more, completed
both during the ﬁeld study and
afterward. _
Reynolds will have three sculp-

tures created from found materi- “

als featured in the exhibit. On his
pieces made from railroad spikes,
he said, “The interesting thing
about it is that it’s just big clunky
metal, but when you brush by it or
bump it, it makes a light, delicate 5,
noise.”

Reynolds had initially planned
on doing exclusively watercolor

FOOD COLUMN

Balancing food and thought

Sarah Simkin
Columnist _

 

V So you’re back from winter break and

have survived the first week of term —
more or less. You know what you have
to do to shoulder your academic course
load, although whether you choose to do

‘ it is up to you. But all is not entirely set

for the semester.
Look at your schedule. Whether you
can get‘ across campus to be in the ap-

" propriate classrooms at the right times is

not the concern of this column — sprint!‘
i—— instead, the question of the day is: Did '
you ifa'ctor.in time to eat?
,I’rn{'not'ta1king about time to prepare
gourmet meals or even grocery shop on
a regular basis — there are all kinds of

_ time—saving tricks out there to make food

acquisition and preparation manageable
for evenpthe student with the most hectic
agenda. It is, however, all too possible to
create a schedule in which, on some _days,
you literally do not have time for more
than a granola bar. T

If you’ve found yourself in this situa-
tion, all is not lost —— add-drop doesn’t
end until Tuesday, Jan. 18, so you’ve still
got some time to do a cost—beneﬁt analy-
sis of whether only being able to eat every
other day is worth knocking out all those
credits. Ask yourself: Are differentgsec?
tions of the coursesiyou need offered at

is other, more feasible timeslots? Did you

build everything around avoiding classes

-on Friday at the cost of 10 solid booked

hours on Mondays and Wednesdays?Was
that really the exercise—of sound reason-
i~,ng?..- ._ 5 i ‘
 Night classes can be great for freeing

. ._ up timf§_fo.r_ eating — you’ve got all day for

bréakfast:,i.*brunch, lunch, snacking — but
too many will burn you out and leave you
unavailable for the all-important dinner
time slot. * O V _

This is not nly injurious to a three-
rneal—a—d'ay diet at reasonable times,

but can be tremendously damaging to
your social life as well. I took three night
classes last semester, and do you know
how often I got to see all the friends who
were meeting up for dinner without me?
Rarely.

So, if classes are preventing you from
eating, why not just eat while you’rein
class? Sorry, that’s,not an endorsable

solution either. It isn’t going to get you

a detention like it might have in high
school, but some professors are agitated
by it and some classrooms outright forbid
it (The Cathedral is a historical landmark

V people! You can’t be sloshing soft drinks V

and crumbs all over it!). _ A

And of course, how well can you really
take notes or participate when distracted
with snacking? Maybe you’re more tal-
ented than I am, but I»can’t type with one

hand while eating an apple if I want my‘

notes to be remotely decipherable.
So is just skipping meals viable’? No,
no it is not. When you’re hungry you

’ might find that you physically cannot

concentrate —— not a terriﬁc thing for any
would—be student. Furthermore, if your
classmates can’t hear the lecture over the
sound of your stomach growling, that’s
no way to make friends, let alone get into
a study group. Also, hungry people can

' be grouchy people, and irritability gets

you-nowhere. a A .

Ultimately, there’s sometimes no way
to get around taking a certain class at
a certain time, and work hours may or
may not be -negotiable. What can you do
if you’re stuck with them? Eat a solid
breakfast and make something quick
and easy when you get home. Keeping
an emergency granolalor protein bar in
your backpack is not a bad idea either.
However, keeping fruit in your backp_ack
that you will inevitably forget about is
bad idea — trust me.» I g '

spired during his drive to Wyoming by the
many cars sitting in ﬁelds “slowly becoming
one with nature.” He captured the phenom-
ena in a series of three photographs, which
will also be part of the exhibit.
Womelsdorf described her ink drawings
appearing in the exhibition as “works with
colorful, ephemeral backgrounds that are

P grounded by a black silhouette of one of the

many icons of the Wyoming landscape, such
as a wind mill or pronghorn antelope.”
The exhibit is entirely curated and as-

’ sembled by the four studio art students.

Jenkins said that the students’ involvement
with creating the exhibit was crucial.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers hope forsucesswarom hom

 

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Thus far, road trips have not
been kind to the Pitt women’s
basketball team —— the Panthers
have dropped five of their eight

away games, including their two

most recent contests.

But the team has an oppor-
tunity to ﬁnish its current road
trip with an even 2-2 record with
a win against Big East opponent
Seton Hall tonight at 7.

After falling 79-68 to Lou-

isville in their Big East Confer— -

ence opener, the Panthers (8-7,
0-1 Big East) will travel to New
Jersey to take on the Seton Hall
Pirates (7-8, 0-2 Big East).

Scott, playing on the road pres-
ents a challenge for ‘the team

junior forward Kandice Green,

as well as rebounds.

Though Green’s offensive
performance has been a bright
spot, Seton Hall has struggled
to produce points. The Pirates
currently rank last in the Big

A East in field—goal percentage

and second to last in total scor-
ing offense. _

Scott mentioned that pre-
game nerves are present in all
players, regardless of experi-
ence, but the Panthers are in a
unique situation.

The 2010-2011 Pitt team is
comprised of only seniors and
freshmen, creating a unique
team dynamic.

pre-game preparations.

“We try to go over game-like
situations in practice, but in the
game it is much more intense,”
Scott said after the loss to Louis-
ville. “On the road in a big game,-
everyone has the jitters, not just
the freshmen.”

As a senior, Scott has led by
example in recent games and
her performance will be a key to
success against Seton Hall. '

In her past three games, Scott
has averaged 13 points and just
under 10 rebounds per game,
including two double—double
performances.

Even more impressive has

been fellow senior forward Chel-S

games this season, giving her

TONY’S TOP 10

What to look for in Graham

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

 

Pitt winning the BBVA Compass
Bowl on Saturday over the SEC’s
worst bowl-eligible team, Ken-
tucky, hardly negates the fact
that this year was a disastrous,

one for the Panthers football
team._ In fact, “fiasco” might be
a better word.

With the whole’Michael Hay-
wood chaos, multiple player
arrests, ﬁve losses on national
television and the crazy coach-
ing search, it would be easy to

dwell on P_itt’s mistakes and point —

ﬁngers (cough, Steve Pederson,
cough).

But in the spirit of the new year,
I’m going to look ahead for my
first Top 10 of2011. This week, I
bring you the top 10 things I want
in Pitt’s new coach Todd Graham.

After arecent loss to Duquesne, which
ended a three-game Panthers winning
streak, Sims noted that with the approach
of conference play, the team needed to
refocus.

“We need to go back to the drawing
board and execute effectively,” Sims said.
“We know what we need to do to prepare
for the Big East.”

With one Big East game behind them,

the Panthers hope to learn from the Lou-
isville game and move on to secure awin.

“We have to learn from our losses and
how to bounce back from defeat,” Scott

O the Pitt program after this

_ coaching explosion is build-

coaches with him, but they are currently
ﬂoating in limbo. ‘

Recruits. Pitt started with 17 re-'

6 down to six. The new.coach needs

to bring at least a few recruits to

fill the player vacancies. Graham will

I likely add to the recruiting class if hired.

More liberal offense. One popu-

8 lar criticism of former head coach
0 Dave Wannstedt was that his play-
calling wasitoo conservative. Too

, manytirnes on third and long, the Pan-

thers would run a short pass to the outside

that had littlechance of picking up the first ,

down. The new coach needs to be-willing
to try something new.

Balance between coach and
7 friend. A head coach needs to
0 be respected ——' and maybe even
. feared a little bit — by his play-
ers. But he also needsto be a friend and
mentor. Wannstedt, perhaps, was too
much like. a friend andnot enough like a
coach. Evidence of this could be the fact
that Wannstedt is still advising his play-
ers on whether or not to enter the NFL
Draft. .
The new coach needs to find a
better balance between mentor-
ing the players and coaching them.
6 0 a horrible year as the Panthers’
quarterback. Although he didn’t
make many disastrous mistakes, he\didn’t
complete many spectacular passes, either.
Part of this was because there wasn’t a
true competition between Sunseri and
Pat Bostick for the starting job in train-
ing camp.
Sunseri was billed as the starter since

tition. Tino Sunseri didn’t have

An open quarterback compe- '

the spring camp last April. A healthy com-
petition could have helped him develop his
skills even further if the stakes at practice
were higher. The new coach needs to bring
a competitive mentality to training camp.

Discipline. This is an obvious one.

5 Not only should the coach him-
. 0 self be disciplined and stay out of
trouble, but he needs to discipline

his players and keep them out of trouble.
4 0‘ one goal — a National Champi-
onship. That’s certainly a worthy

goal, but perhapsit was too ingrained in
their heads. When the Panthers lost at
Utah in the season opener, it deﬂated most

hopes for a national title. _

- The 2011 Panthers probably aren’t go-
ing to win the BCS National Champion-
ship game. The new coach needs to realize

this and set the team’s sights on the Big
East Championship and a BCS Bowl win.‘

Realistic ambitions. In training
camp last August, the players had

Pitt Pride. For all of Wannst-

3 edt’s criticisms, there’s'no de-
' O nying that he was a Pitt guy. He
is from Pittsburgh, he went to

Pitt and he bleeds blue and gold. Sure,
it’s going to be tough to find someone
with" that much Pitt Pride. But -it’s not
too much to ask of a coach to take pride
in his job and the school that he repre-
sents, no. matter where he comes from.

2 Excitement. Pitt has eight
0 home games next season, which

means the Panthers have a lot
of seats to ﬁll at Heinz Field. None of
Pitt’s six games this year were sellouts.
So the new coach will have to bring. a lot
of excitement and stir up the fan base
to try to fill those ugly yellow seats.

1 1 Wins. In the end, winning is all
0 that matters. No matter how well
a coach recruits, how’ much ex-
citement he generates or how much Pitt
_Pride he has, nobody will be satisﬁed until
the Panthers win a big game, such as a Big‘
East Championship and a BCS Bowl. I
