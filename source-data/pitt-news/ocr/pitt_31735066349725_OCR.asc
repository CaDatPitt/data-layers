OSGB Appeals Remunerations 39"°*9 3°"°l 5°mP'€$

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

Remunerations for student lead-
ers will be delayed because of an
appeal process begun by the
Student Government Board (SGB)
at Thursday’s meeting.

The SGB voted to appeal a
proposal submitted by the remun-
erations committee which would
allocate $15,000 of student activity
fee revenues to 25 student leaders.

,4vf~g,The SGB appeal challenges the

ircriteria used by the remunerations

committee in choosing which
student organization members
should receive remunerations.

The committee used seven
criteria in making its recommenda-
tions, weighing some more heavily
than others.

The committee awarded remun-
eration tothe 25 positions which
best filled the criteria of adminis-
trative demand, autonomy of the
position, complexity of duties,
intergroup interaction, personal

_expense, special required skills and

‘a.~_»_-jme commitment.

After reviewing the initial
proposal, SGB member Robin

l 50 Students wait

Wertkin objected to the overall ..

subjectivity of applicant screening.

Several board members said they
believed time demand should carry
more weight than was allotted in
the original proposal. They also
said undue weight was allotted to
the criterion of autonomy.

SGB President Barry Weisband
suggested an organization's impact
on campus life be added as a
criterion. '

The absence of required advis-
or’s signatures on several applica-
tions was another inconsistency in
the remunerations process, accord-
ing to Wertkin.

Director of Student Activities
Dan Meloro will review the appeal
and make a recommendation to
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
Alfred Moye, who will decide if the
appeal is valid.

If Moye rejects the appeal, the
original proposal will be implem-
ented.

In other business, Senate Budget
Policies Committee student rep-
resentative Maureen Maloney said
most state legislators have not
responded to SGB letters request-

ing they pledge to vote in May for
an increase in state appropriations
to higher education.

“It looks like Pitt will receive the
govemor’s proposed $59.9 million
plus $60,000 for the dental school, ”
Maloney said.

Pitt had requested $68.5 million
in appropriations. ' .

Board members also reﬂected on
April’s rally to ﬁght tuition hikes.

“The rally helped to educate
people but I don’t think it changed
the minds of Board of Trustees
members of legislators,” . SGB
member Chip Hubbard said.

“We got the people there but we

,didn’t tell them what to do after the

rally,” SGB member Benita Mar-
cus remarked. '

Co-op committee chairperson
Freida Lalli reported the food co-op
did $130 worth of business last
week. She expects orders to double
this week.

The Committee on Student

Organizations will hold a hearing“

on Tuesday to determine if the
Commuter Association will be
allowed to maintain organizational
status which allows it to draw funds
from the student activity fee.

Extra Housing Called Unlikely

BY CRIS HALL

Chances that approximately 150
students on a waiting’ list for fall
housing will receive accomodations

in University dormitories arepvery ‘

agiinlikely, according to Housing

Director Don Hughes.

These students may receive
University-supplied housing should
Housing Office attempts to secure
additional space in the Webster
Hall Hotel and in Carlow College
dormitories prove successful.

The waiting list was formed in
early March after a previously set
limit of 2,200 returning upperclass-
men was reached and additional
students requested housing. An
unexpectedly high demand for
campus housing last year caused
the unprecedented move to place a
ceiling on the numberof residents
who would be able to return t
University housing. 1

Hughes said there are no
transfer students or commuters on
the list, which is comprised of

Publications Director

Joe Colangelo Dies

The University community was

fir-saddened to learn of the death of

Joseph G. Colangelo Jr., Pitt's link
with the outside media for 16 years
in his position as director of news
and publications. He was 40.
Colangelo died Friday evening at
Presbyterian-University Hospital
after a sporadic 12-year struggle

with illness. He is survived by wife-

Marie Marcaldi Colangelo and six
children aged 12 to 20.

Funeral services were held
yesterday in St. Paul’s Cathedral
where Vice Chancellor for Public
Affairs Bernard Kobosky delivered
one of three eulogies.

 “Joe was a man whose life was
dedicated to society and to the

University...There was dignity.

warmth and purpose in the man we
mourn. . , ’ ' Kobosky said.

At the age of 24, Colangelo
joined the University under Chan-
cellor Edward Litchﬁeld, bringing
with him ﬁve years of news
experience from a stint with
International News Service.

Colangelo founded the Univer-
sity Times, presently the official
University newspaper, as a pioneer
attempt at public relations for
institutions of higher education.
The University Times is unique in
the country for its editorial freedom
and staff members have received
numerous awards for the quality of
reporting. ‘

Colangelo was no stranger to

students who have paid a $100
advance for a room but have no
guarantee of any accomodation.

“We don’t think it’s fair to tie up
their moneyfor three months and
then ‘probably not be able to
accommodate them come fall,”
Hughes said, “although many
people in that category have
expressed an interest.”

Also waiting for. possible fall
accommodations are some 75
“relocates,” students transferring
to the Oakland campus from branch
campuses. Prospects for these

ShowRevisions Ahead U

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

_ A sampling ' of votes already
mailed in indicates a proposed
revision in the structure of the
University Senate will be ratiﬁed
by the 1,200-member body, Senate
president William Brown said at a
Senate Council meeting yesterday.

The most notable feature of the
plan, which was recommended by
the Ad Hoc Committee on
University Governance, .is‘~ the
proposed creation of an assembly
composed solely of faculty mem-
bers.

According to the Committee's
ﬁnal report, the Faculty Assembly
“should be a body to recommend
policy on matters that affect the
quality and welfare of the
University. Its purpose should be
to formulate. and express faculty
views, criticisms, "and inquiries on
such matters.”

The new plan would maintain the
present Senate Council, which is
comprised of student, administra-
tion and faculty representatives,
but the faculty members would be
elected «from the proposed Faculty
Assembly. Presently, they are
elected from University depart-
ments.

Because the faculty has the
largest membership in the Senate
Council, student leaders are
opposed to the new plan because
they fear the Faculty Assembly
would become the dc" facto
governing body of the University
Senate. .

“We ﬁnd the new plan dis-

heartening,” Student Government _

Board President Barry Weisband

A said. “It would create a unilateral

  

Senate. _It would change the”

University Senate into a Faculty
Senate.” ‘

decision making process exclusive’
of the administration and students:
and would hinder the already
limited student voice. in the

Norman Austem, chairman of“

the Ad Hoc Committee, said he
thought the term “decision-
making” was incorrect. _“The
Faculty Assembly and the Univer-
sity Council are only advisory

bodies. Decisions are made by the v ‘

administration. ’ ’

Brown said while he is not

against the Faculty Assembly per‘ :

se, he fears the assembly could
give the impression of faculty

cohesion when there are divergent,

opinions among the faculty. .
The ﬁnal result of the University

Senate vote" will be announced at, A.  1

next month’s Council meeting.

other things, to make Oakland a cleaner place to liveduring Pa Pitt

Sample and Savor Ethnici

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

Strolling on Forbes Ave., my
eyebrows raised and nose perked,
past Schenley Hall and Stephen
Foster Memorial, left just before S.
Craig St., visions of baklava and
scents of cheese and onion
beckoned me to the doors of St.
Nicholas Cathedral at'the corner of
Forbes and Dithridge.

The annual Greek Food Festival
in early December celebrates St.
Nicholas day. The event was such

\,a success, a repeat performance

ll‘-was scheduled for this week.

“Our festival last December was
our first large scale production of
the event,” said event chairman
Art Dordas. “We received so
many compliments and requests
for another festival that we decided
to have it again in April.”

Most of the 22 women who spent
one-and-a-half months preparing
the food are first or second
generation Greeks with an ethnic
affinity which gives the festival a
communal aura.

“Last time we started to run out
of food, but not this time,” Dordas
said. “There’s lots of food for

 And there was plenty.

“We’ll attack the problem of
placing returning upperclassmen
first,” Hughes said. “At this time,
no one on the waiting list has a

In its effort to obtain additional
fall accommodations, the Housing
Office has contacted the Webster
Hall and Carlow, both of which
were used this year to house the
overﬂow ofresident students.

The Housing Office already has
given students on the waiting list
the opportunity to recover their
advance deposits and be removed
from the list. ‘ "

Hughes said his ofﬁce will be
sending letters to 4students who

already have contracts to give them -

a chance to get out of the contracts.

Last year, between 50 and 60
students took advantage of the
offer, but Hughes said he does not
expect as many students to do so
this year because more of the
contracts were for returning
upperclassmen. '

During the festivities, Dordas

to the church.

 Extra Housing Called Unlikely-

Hughes said_his office expects to
have an exact count of non-dormi-
tory spaces available to students on
the waiting list on or before June 1.
He hopes to advise students on the
waiting list of their chances of
receiving University-supplied fall
housing.

A recent letter from Hughes

asked students on the waiting list .

to notify the Housing Office before
May 15 of their decision to remain
on the list or to be removed for
further consideration for Univer-
sity-supplied fall housing. Of 25'
students who replied to Housing as
of yesterday, 24 expressed a desire
to remain on the list.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

 A A Faculty Power Bloc

It looks as if the Faculty Assembly  by the Ad Hoc

A Committee on University Governance  be ratiﬁed by the 1,200

members of the University Senate. According to University Senate

 ;. President William Brown, a random sampling of the votes already

mailed in shows the new plan for the University Senate leads by a
comfortable margin. -

The proposed Faculty Assembly would be a body to “recommend '
policy on matters that affect the qualityand welfare of the University.’ ’

Its purpose will be to formulate and express faculty views, criticisms,
and inquiries on such matters. The Faculty Assembly will also send
faculty representatives to the Senate Council.

It is easy to see why most of the faculty members want a
representative body exclusive of students and administrators where
their opinions, as a group, can be formulated and made known. The
recent faculty vote on unionization shows that there is a growing desire
among faculty members for some sort of body where they can express
their views.

'- Unfortunately, the creation of the Faculty Assembly poses a threat to i

the effectiveness of the Senate Council, which is the only place on

campus where the students, faculty, and administration can meet and

discuss University problems. The threat lies in creating a single

faculty opinion on issues where, until now, there has been a divergence

’ of opinion. While creating a single faculty opinion ,will no doubt

enhance their power, it does little to promote a free ﬂow of discussion
which is one of the Senate Council’s most stirling qualities.

The Faculty Assembly also threatens to take over the Senate Council

if it adopts the practice of having its representative vote as a bloc, since

is “ ’ the faculty holds a majority in the Council: We also wonder how much

meaningful discussion would take place in the University Senate if
everybody knew that in the end, the faculty would win by sheer weight
of numbers. ‘

The Faculty Assembly also dilutes student input in the governing of
the University.’ Already a minority, students surely could not be very
effective in the face of an all-powerful faculty bloc. _

Of course, none of this need happen. If faculty remember they
represent only one group on campus, and that there is always more
than one side to an issue, the Assembly could become a valuable part

_ A of the University Senate. . V

- Strong andGent|e

This University can be a confusing place when viewed from the
outside. It is at times torn by dissent and debate mystitying if not
irritating to witness.

For the past 16 years the man who explained the events in this

' -complex community was Joe Colangelo. Through his efforts in working

withilocal media he made the University more accessible and more
understandable not only to "people outside the academic mainstream
but to those of us inside as well. It is hard to say which beneﬁtted
most. '

Until his recent death Joe Colangelo served this University with sldll,
wit and integrity. He built a highly respected news and publications
department and an award-winning newspaper, the University Times,
on the convictions of objectivity and truth.

, It was his view that it was no victory to sacriﬁce credibility with the
public in order to weather hysteria over the latest crisis. It is a tribute
to the man that he was not only right but also that he fought for this

 ‘ principal of playing it straight even when it hurt.

His courage in a 12-year ﬁght with illness, his energy in pursuing
life and learning, his compassion and his keen wit forms a more lasting
memore of Joe Colangelo than any stone monument.

We should not let this memory pass. We have lost a strong and

No Need for Guilt  

BY BILL MOORE‘

“It’s just not fair. The only
news you print about Greeks is
derogatory. ’ ’

something good you ignore us. But
let us make one false step, and
whammo...lt’s all over the front

“We do a lot more than just.

drink, but you wouldn’t know it
after reading the Pitt News. We all
know you people hate us.”

“Yes, but...”

The person saying more than
“Yes, but...” is a Greek and a
strong advocate of the Greek
system. He was complaining about

two stories which appeared in last “

week’s Pitt News.

The ﬁrst, headlined “Affiliate To
Aid Fire Victims,’.’ quoted an area
secretary for the national chapter of
Delta Phi Epsilon sorority. She
said the national would be granting
a loan to the sorority once a
‘damage estimate from the recent
fire was submitted. The story also
went into a brief description of the
ﬁre, which occurred while the Pitt
News was not publishing.

The second story in question was
headlined “Frats Termed Irres-
ponsible” and concerned itself with
attacks on frat behavior by Bayard
Street residents who live _directly
across from some fraternity
houses.

Two points were omitted from
the stories, the complaintant

screamed into the phone. The ﬁre
story neglected to mention" the
efforts of 17 fraternity men who
cleaned out the rooms of sorority
women forced to relocate after the

ﬁre. “We saved the university a _

great deal of money,” he said.

The second story wasﬁne, he
explained, but it would have been
better had it mentioned the fact
fraternities on Bellefield and
Dithridge had successfully worked
out similar problems with neigh-
bors.

He was right in that those two
points were overlooked. However,
the conspiracy theory—“You hate
us, so you only print bad
things”—just doesn’t wash.

BEHIND THE LINES

There have been problems in the
past between Greeks and the Pitt
News, but theblame is shared by
both. There is, however, nothing
in the Pitt News handbook about
rnaligning Greeks. A

A major part of the problem is
hypersensitivity on the part of the
Greeks. “We are trying to change
the/Férception-“of what Greeks are.
all about,” the fraternity leader on
the phone explained, “We are
trying to end the stereotype that
Greeks are like what was portrayed
in the Bayard Street story.”

Greeks have been trying to
change that stereotype for years,
but it stubbornly persists. The
reason is easy to explain.

Despite the help Greeks gave the
sorority women, despite the annual

charity drives, despite the hard

‘work they put into Homecoming

each year, the main function of the‘
Greeks is social. It is ludicrous to
claim otherwise.

The stereotype persists because
Pitt students have eyes. They see’
frat houses, and see what goes" on

      

inside on weekends, and they draw--£5}?

their own conclusions regardless of
what others tell them. _p
What's hard to figure out is why
the frat‘ men worry about it. There
is nothing wrong with having a 
good time—whether you drink
beer, sing songs or whatever—and

they would be smart to just admit ‘

it. Everyone would understand.

But day in and day out they cite
their numerous crusades and
causes and act as though the Friday
night bashes were merely spontan-
eous surprises. “My goodness, I

don't know how this party
started,” they seem to say.
When the Pitt News, the

Pittsburgh Press or anyone else:
says -frat guys drink beer they are
not wrongfully attacking fraterni-
ties. They are not attacking them
at all.  ‘

Any beer distributor will tell you
alot of beer is consumed by frats,
and everyone else will tell you they

’ don't really care.

Greeks might as wellfadmit it.
Aside from occasional overzealous-

ness, the only thing‘ wrong with .
their parties is the laughable”

Bst of Luck i
To Food Co-Op

it was with more than passing
interest I read an article on the
Student Government food co-op.
As a. part-time student in the
Graduate School of Business, I
have worked full-time in the retail
food industry for almost ﬁve years.

Project chairperson Freida Lalli
made ‘the statement chain stores

 e “mark up goods 50 to 100%." I

kzrust.

would advise Ms. Lalli to do some
research in this area ‘as this is the
most ludicrous statement I have
heard since the early days of
Watergate.

Typical margins are: dry grocery
l5-l8%; dairy 18-20%; frozen food
20-25%

I feel quite safe in saying that
only between .01 and .02% of all
items in a grocery store have a
markup higher than 35%, and
these are usually seasonal items.

I would like to wish the SGB food
co-op the best of luck in its efforts:
with Ms. Lalli as chairperson it will
need all the luck it can find.

Civic Arena Show

BY CONNIE GIEL

'Not many people get excited
about old Grecian and Roman
statues, the remaining relics of
But
when the marble turns to ﬂesh, and _

"chiseled features come to life,

excitement is generated.

The Lipizzan stallions that

.came to Pittsburgh last weekend

‘seemed to have stepped out of the
Parthenon ruins.
Eight satiny stallions, bred along
the ancient lines of classical equine
beauty, precisely performed the
movements conceived in the 16th
century byAustrian emperor Maxi-
rnilian II to train war horses worthy
of his royal knights. The emperor
insisted his horses be able to
suspend themselves in midair, leap
on two legs, and prance in place; all

to enable a knight to maneuver

easily in his weighty armor.

The Lipizzan horses—named for
a small town near the Adriatic
Sea—were the result of ambitious
breeding of Arabian and Spanish
horses. The emperor was
chagrined when the first-born foal
emerged jet black, looking like a

common farm horse. But several
years later, as the colt matured, his
coat became grey, then white, until
he looked like a steed worthy of
royalty. Most of the Lipizza horses
underwent the transformation,

becoming pure white before the
age of 10.

 

This position, the Levade done by
the Royal Lipizzan Stallions in the
Civic Arena show, is a particularly
difficult stance for horses to
achieve. The ‘amount of muscle
control and perfection of balance
required to maintain this position is
almost beyond belief.

From *one beer lover to another.

  The Lipizzan Splendour

But the emperor knew his

knights could not conquest, on
pretty horses. -The Lipizzaners had
to be nimble,_ ﬂeet, strong. And
they were. Colts playing in
pastures exhibited unheard-of be-'
havior, bounding high into the air
for the sheer joy of it.

The exurberance was harnessed
and the Lipizzans were carefully
schooled in the art of dressage,
complex horse and‘ rider maneu-
vers. The white horses have
retained much of the traditional

grace and beauty of the emperor’s

royal stallions.

Dozens of the Lipizzans journey
from Charleston, West Virginia 11
months out of each year, perform-
ing in the United States and
abroad. David Jay, a lean and lithe
senior rider, talked of life on the
road with the Lipizzans.

“Most of the riders with the
show have come from horse show
and dressage backgrounds.
They’re used to traveling a circuit,
sleeping in motels every night of
the year.” .

Plant’s Vocals Bog  

ZeppeIIin'

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Led Zeppelin, Presence
Swan Song 8416

Led Zeppelin could release an
album of synthesized toilet flushing
and never have to worry one iota
about the ensuing record sales.
Any album with the name Led

Zeppelin on it sells. And sells, and __

sells. . . Its current album, Presence
is superiorto just about 99% of the
hard rock sludge ﬂooding the

airwaves, it is disappointing in ‘

light of the band’s past recording
achievements.

The problem with Presence is not
in the production or instrumenta-
tion. Producer Jimmy Page still
displays a clever knack of injecting
a full, rich sound into the music
that literally booms out of the
grooves. His guitar playing (mostly
complex chord structures; instead
of maniacal solos) effectively
creates moods.

The other two instrument-play-
ing members’ of Zeppelin (bass
player John Paul Jones . and
drummer John Bonham) have
never sounded better. They
provide a thick, prominent bottom
that brings kick and attack to the
music. Unfortunately, however,
lyricist and vocalist Robert Plant
has never sounded worse.

The twelve-minute opening cut,
“Achilles Last Stand,” is basically
a vibrant progression on one riff
that runs out of steam when Plant
opens his mouth. Plant has written
his share of insightful lyrics in the
past (“Stairway to Heaven” and
“Over the Hills and Far Away”)
but on “Achilles Last Stand,” both

‘ lyrics .and vocals seem forced,

making the song abrasive and
totally monotonous.

On “Candy Store Rock,” Plant’s

X:-Rated Theatrics
Of Mad-Cap Tubes

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

To the Tubes, nothing in this
world or the hereafter is sacred.
This West Coast rock-satire
group took mad-cap shots at an
amazing potpourri of subjects
Friday night at the Syria Mosque.

Be it America’s current obsessi-
on- with the bicentennial, pouty
bi-sexual English rockstars, inane
television gameshows, the whims

of the wealthy, sex, drugs, MOR’
radio, Hell’s Angels, surf music or,

religion, nothing was safe from the
Tubes’ strange, sometimes lewd
form of satire.

The Tubes used a grand total of
36 people throughout the evening,
coupled with visual aids such as an

overhead movie screen and five‘

televisions placed in strategic
onstage locations. The' six
backing musicians; drummer, bass
player, dual lead guitarists and two
synthesizer technicians, provided
rock, calypso, jazz, pop and just
plain noise. The rest of the cast of
loonies assumed various roles, then
proceeded to act and improvise on
the musical themes.

If individual stars were to be
'picked, the zany Fee Waybill and
the wacky Re Styles would seem to
be the brightest.

Waybill is’ the lead singer and
chief orchestrater of the stage
insanity, while Styles is his female
counterpart.. On the toned down
numbers, the Captain and Tenille’s
“Love Will, Keep Us Together,”
Tom Jones’ “It’s Not Unusual”
and “The Tubes World Tour,’.’
Waybill proved he could mimic and

.. poke fun at these songs, while still

sounding almost as good as the
originals. These, were relatively
toned down numbers, however,
and the majority of the show was
much more bizarre, oozing sleazy
sexual overtones.

'boring after the — scantily

_F~"'x-
-.-\“¢%i
Waybill, dressed nattily in his 9””

white MC suit, pulled Styles from

the first row and asked her “What

She Wanted From Life.” Although

her reply was a bit too earthy to
print, she did stick around long
enough to ﬂash ‘a very nicely .
rounded derriere. During “Pimp”

and “Slipped My Disco,” Waybill
came out dressed to kill in hot pink
jumsuit and hat, and did an adagio
dance with Styles, who was attired

in a see-through tube top, black
fright’ wig complete with tropical
fruit and stilettoes. During§_t-E?
“Mondo Bondage,” Waybill came

out onstage in a full black leather
hood ’n"cap torture suit. During
.“Don’t Touch Me There,” Styles

(the motorcycle moll) told Waybill

(the greasy biker) how she loved
“the smell of his fresh leather and
exhaust fumes.”

About halfway through the show,

the Tubes persistance at grossing

out the audience started turning
their fan’s earlier howls of laughter

into sighs of disgust. “Madam I'm‘
Adam” was an unusual interpreta-
tion ofthe Genesis, but got to be
clad
dancers left the stage, _ leaving
Waybill (in jockstrap and plastic ﬁg “
leaf) all by his lonesome.

The last two numbers, “Boy
Crazy” and “White Punks on
Dope,” were completely theatrical
with intentions of overkilling.
Waybill assumed the role of Quay
Lewd, the bi-sexual English super-
star rock dude, with the rest of the '
cast running around grabbing each
others’ genitals (close-ups of this
were flashed on the ﬁlm screen and
televisions).

The Tubes throw tasteful satire ' _
and discretion out the window the 
moment they step onstage. The
humor is crude, gross and
offensive, but it is not without its ‘
moments of ridiculous brilliance.

ing its 1975-76 musical comedy

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213

Dear Ms. Roberts:

At this time we would like to share with you our expression
of thanks to the PSEA/Pitt chapter for its extensive help and support
during the_recent collective’ bargaining election for University of
Pittsburgh faculty. The efforts of our friends in PSEA were crucial
in amassing the very significant proportion of votes received by .
the Pitt Professional Union in the runoff. This spirit of cooperation
and its public display serve as clear examples that groups can forego '

their individual diferences and stand united to attain a common goal. 1

The Pitt Professional Union is now awaiting with great
interest the results of the upcoming collective bargaining election
for staff here at Pitt. We support the unionization of these workers
for the same reasons that we support collective bargaining for faculty
and graduate employees: unionization is the only viable alternative
to administrative control. With this in mind the PPU urges the
support personnel of the University of Pittsburgh to vote for '
collective bargaining on May 12. 1 —

Very truly yours,

Ronaele M. Novotny

- To Pitt Support Staff:

In the blizzard of propaganda the bosses have been inflicting on you
in recent days, one item deserves your particular attention.
"Clearly/’ says Tom‘ Cherry, ”we have neither met all their (the
staff's) needs nor been able to assure the equitable application
of policy and practice. . . . You can be assured the message has
been received by management. Action will follow.’’

lam sure staff members, in a. spirit of good will and fellowship,
will cooperate with _Mr. Cherry‘ in his commendable desire to
correct the. inequities he mentions. Provide him with a legally
binding collective bargaining contract /th rough which both the
bosses and the staff can achieve what,-if Mr. Cherry is to be
taken seriously, must be mutually desirable goals.

In the interest ofnyour own welfare as well as the welfare of
the University, it is my great hope that.you will vote for

UPSPA Committee:

There is no sensible reason why the support personnel of the
University of Pittsburgh would not organize into a unit for
collective bargaining. The increasingtrend of the University
toward a management system approach to administration
has clearly mandated some kind of protective organization
for staff. Also, one must be clearly aware of the anti-union
sentiment that has been expressed, often in subtle tones, by
the administration of this University. That, however, is to
be expected. That sentiment should not, however, be
mistaken. If the administration of this University were
genuinely concerned about the welfare of its employees, as
it has often stated, it would support, rather than oppose,
collective bargaining.

Sincerely,

Louis A. Petrone

Dear Reni

This letter is to state my support for you organization

_ in its efforts to gain collective bargaining for staff at the

University. The items listed under "Why Organize” in your
brochure" are proper ones to be included in an agreement.

Just one word of caution. Please be sure that the
organization supports clearly stated Affirmative Action Plan.
This can sometimes be a quite fuzzy area in statements by
the organization.. -A

Much luck to you in your organizing efforts.

 On a beautiful weekend for
.outdoor sporting events, the
Pittsburgh area was once again
 treated to one of the most
competitive meets in the eastern
‘United States when the sixth
annual Pitt Invitational Track meet
made its two-day stand last
‘weekend. ,
Penn State's Mike Shine cap-

’ Atured the event’s most valuable-

performer award. Shine won two
races, the 120-yard high hurdles in
a meet record time of 13.8 seconds
and the 440-yard intermediate
' . ‘hurdles race in a blisterin
' meet-record 50.4 seconds. '
Penn State, ﬁelding an excepti-
onally strong team. this spring,
captured seven ﬁrsts in 20 events.
Another Penn Stater, distance
runner George Malley, went into
the steeplechase last Sunday with
the third fastest time in the nation
this year.
Malley’s goal for this year’s
.. invitational was to break the meet
steeplechase record he set last

year. Malley bettered the 3000-
meter course in winning the event
again this year, and bettered last
year’s time by three seconds,
ﬁnishing the race in 8:3l.7.

The Panthers didn’t fare as well
as expected, but considering the
possible Olympic talent at this,
year’s meet, the result was hardly
disappointing. Pitt freshman Eric
Drescher claimed the host team’s
only top prize, winning his
specialty, the shotput. ,

Although the Hershey native has
recorded a heave of 54-11, his
invitational toss of 53-7 was enough
for the blue ribbon.

Villanova’s Eamonn Coghlan‘, an
Ireland native and a sure bet to
represent his homeland in the
upcoming summer Olympics, won
the three mile event with an
impressive time of 13.37.5.

No team standings were kept for
the meet, but Penn State would
have been the runaway champion
with seven firsts. Villanova
recorded three victories, while
Seton Hall and East Carolina each
had two.

Panther Mitters Twice

The Agony and the Ecstasy? Not
quite, but it must have seemed that
way to the young Pitt baseball
team. After copping two with an
impressive double-header sweep of

—Clarion on Wednesday, Pitt
returned home for a 5-1 and 17-5
I double-drubbing from Penn State.

It’s been a difﬁcult year for Coach ’

Lewis’ men with injuries, and
' inexperience and inclimate weather

taking their toll on Panther hopes

. for a winning season.

_ The victories over Clarion may
have appeared to be a turning point
for»Coach Lewis and his young
club, but.Penn State's arrival at
. Trees,Field «delayed Pitt's goals.

 

The Nittany Lions outplayed the
Panthers and left unsatisﬁed any
hopes of a complete turnaround as
well as diminishing the chances for
a winning season.

Putting Penn State behind them, ~

the Panthers (now 5-8) venture to
Gettysburg, then continue on the
road to Bucknell and later to
Temple. Pitt will ﬁnish the season
at home with a double-header
against Westminister (May 15) and
a single game with St. John's (May
17).

The Panthers can lose only one
of these next six if they hope to
finish over .500. With the return of
a healthy Allen Webster and
barring any new mishaps, the
Panthers just may make a run at it.

The University of Pittsburgh has
often prided itself on the academic

capabilities of its student athletes.

Such is the case of Tom Richards.
Richards, as you know, was a
four-year starter on the Panther
basketball team. Two of those four
years, he helped Pitt squads gain
post-season berths--Pitt was an
NCAA Eastern Regional ﬁnalist in
1973 and participant in the 1974
National Invitational Tournament.
Last week, Richards was selected
by the NCAA ofﬁce in Shawnee
Mission, Kansas as one of only
three basketball players in the
country from Division I univer-
sities, to receive an NCAA post
graduate scholarship award. The
two other Division I players to

receive the $1,500 scholarship were
Pat Tallent of George Washington
and Steve Copp of San Diego State.

A 6-0 guard out of Moon
Township High School in Murrys-
ville, Pa., Richards was a starter
for Coach Buzz Ridl’s squad from
the midway point in his freshman
year.

The past season, he was named
the team’s co-captain, and, despite
playing with a fractured navicular
bone in his right shooting wrist and
suffering through the later half of
the season with a badly sprained
ankle, ﬁnished his career with 873
points. This put Richards _11th on
Pitt’s all-time scoring charts.

Playing the point guard position,
he also ﬁnished as the second
all-time assist leader, with 307.

Academically, Richards com-
piled a 3.5 quality point average in
the study of economics,
consistently made the Dean’s list.
He was also active in many
campus organizations.

His selection to the ‘ NCAA
scholarship list represents .the
continuing concern of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh to its com-
mitment "to the image of the
‘ ‘ student-athlete. ’ ’

I

and’

RhardsscholarshivRecipient

In almost unheard-offashion, the
University has consistently at-

scholarship committee. This marks
the third consecutive year a
Panther athlete has received the
post-graduate scholarship.

Two football players have re-
ceived the award the past two
years. Offensive guard Dave
Blandino was honored with the
post-graduate scholarship in 1974.
Panther split end Todd Toerper
was awarded the honor last year.

Next year, a Panther baseballer
is in line for the award. Pitcher
Don Kennedy has
requirements, and has a good
chance to give Pitt a record four in
a row.

Kennedy is also the heart of the
Panther pitching staff this season,

‘with a 2.35 earned run average

going into last weekend.

  Tris To The Top?

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

This year the Pittsburgh
Triangles will need all the hustle
they can get. With all the new
stars signed by World Team Tennis
(WTT)- for the 1976 season, the
word intense -might be an under-
statement when used to describe
the competition. This year’s
rookies include Rod Laver, Czech
expatriate Martina Navratilova,
Chris Evert, Ille Nastase, Jeff
Borowiak, John Alexander, An-
drew Pattison and Cliff Drysdale.

If the Triangles do not play even
better than they did last year, then
gone are‘ the days of winning an
amazing 143 sets against 77 losses,
a 65% average. , ,

All in all,’ the Triangles should
again, by a small margin, end up'in
ﬁrst place in the Eastern Division.
They are a solid team with much

' depth. ‘Take singles for instance.

Evonne Goolagong had I a set
winning percentage (SWP) of
82.5% last season and Marl’ Cox
had a 15-5 record with 75% SWP.
In doubles, Goolagong and Peggy
Michel had an 82.5% SWP.
winning 33 of 40 sets, while Cox
and Vitas Gerulaitis had a 65%
SWP. winning 13 of 20 sets. Depth
and percentages like that make the
Triangles the best team in WTT.

Running close to Pittsburgh and
ﬁnishing second will be the New
York Sets, who are another solid
team with great depth. However,
the Sets have never been able to
hold up during the ﬁnal stretch of
the season. At theend of last
season, the team fell into second
place and then lost to Boston in the
playoffs. The year before, when
the ‘Sets were known as the
Philadelphia Freedoms, they lost
the championship to the Denver
Racquets, who now play home
matches in Phoenix.

The Cleveland Nets will be the
most improved team in the Eastern
Division and will ﬁnish third, with
an outside chance of ﬁnishing
second. The Nets have Martina
Navratilova, the world's third-
ranked women's ‘player behind
Goolagong and Chris Evert. They
also have player-coach Marty
Riessen, WTT’s top male singles
player.

In fourth place will be the Boston-
Lobsters, who will have a strong
male contingent with player-coach
Ion Tiriac, Bob Hewitt and John
Alexander. The Boston women will
be improved but will lack the depth
and strength of the men. The
women may be the Achilles’ heel of
the team, along with Hewitt until
he fully recovers from elbow
surgery.

William Bereman, owner of the
Indiana Loves, is either the
shrewdest or the most naive owner
in WTT. He has the theory you
don’t need any big-name stars, just
unknown ones who will work hard
and then win. Last year his theory
was proven wrong and will again
this year as the Loves ﬁnish in/the
cellar without a big-name player.‘

In the Western Division, the San
Francisco Golden Gaters again are
the most solid team, strong in
men’s, women’s and mixed compe-
tition. Tom Okker, Jeff Borowiak
and player-coach Fred McMillan
will be a tough men’s competition
to beat, while Betty Stove and
Francoise Durr will be the crux of
the women’.s competition.

 
 

The Phoenix Racquets willcome

in second with a stronger squad"

than last season with the addition
of Chris Evert and the return of
Andrew Pattison. Backing them up
will be Kristien Kemmer-Shaw and

- player-coach Tony Roche.

In third will be the always-

competitive Los.Angeles Strings. A .

The strengths of their team will be

» the coaching and playing of Dennis

Ralston, the newly improved Rosie

Casals, Bob Lutz and the Amritraj

brothers. . 1 .
One player doesn’t make a team

I a winner and the fact the Hawaii

Leis have Ille Nastase doesn’t
mean they’ll be a winning team.
The team doesn’t have the depth of
a Phoenix or San Francisco. In
addition. the Leis will be minus
John Newcombe and Margaret
Court, who chose not to sign this
season. As a result the team will
wind up in fourth place.

The San Diego Friars will beg’

headed for oblivion for the second
consecutive year. ' Their main
strength will be the men. They'll

have Rod Laver (imagine him a
rookie),
Drysdale.

Teasof Philosophy

BY GEORGE FAINES

The Art of Tea
Michael Franks .
Warner Bros. .MS 2230
May 2, 1976

Michael Franks has popped out
of nowhere with‘ one of the cutest
albums of the year, The Art of Tea.
Franks has a very gentle and
stylish voice and his backup band is
first-rate. The music is very
mellow and Frank’s lyrics are
amusing, to say the least.

The record opens with “Night-

moves,” a soothing number that '

comments on how love is like “two
dreamers dreaming the exact same

i dream.”

  

“Eggplant” features some hum-
orous lyrics, as well as a vivid
musical arrangement. _

“Monkey See-Monday Do,” the
strongest track on the album, offers
a powerful performance by Dave
Sanborn on alto sax. Franks’

imaginative lyrics are complemen-

ted by a good rhythmic back-

 ground.

The music gets very serious at
times, as when Franks expresses
his opinions on life. “St. Elmo's
Fire” is a sad piece about the
empty feeling you get when “you
start to care, but ﬁnd there is no
one there."

“I Don't Know Why I’m So
Happy I’m Sad” is a touching
number with some nice keyboard
playing by Joe Sample. Franks
confesses: “You’d think by now I
would know better; Love is always
blue.”

“Jive’s is a very jazzy piece
starring Michael Brecker on tenor
sax. Its bouncing beat is a welcome
change from the more mellow
numbers. Franks’ lighthearted
style comes back on the catchy
“Popsicle Toes,” a birthday tribute

to a girl who “is so brave to expose ‘

all those Popsicle Toes.”

The album closes with the
“Mr. Blue.’-’ Franks
musically remembers the places
he’d gone with his lost loverand
compares them to scenes painted
by Cezanne and Chagall.

The Museum of Art, Carnegie

Institute, is exhibiting paintings

and sculptures by two African

$

artists, Amir 1. M. Nour and Chief -. 

Twins Seven in Gallery A. . ‘ “; .'

At first glance Nour’s sculptures  .
appear to be non-ﬁgurative, butihis 6', 
forms come from the images of his 

childhooid-——Islamic architecture,
the gourd works of Calabash
artisans and theNubian hills of his

homeland. Nour uses»a varie‘ty;.of*

metals and materialsfor his worlrs,‘
believes artists should make use of
any material available to them,
even if it comes down to relying on
“the steel of Coca Cola. Caps” to
make his statement.” - ——

In the exhibited works he uses  

steel, iron, aluminum,
cement and calabash.

Twins Seven Seven, a ‘largely 
rself-taught artist, shows unlimited‘

imagination in his “visua1 _pa-

rables,” illustrations of myths told’

by tribal. priests. Calling himself a

“storyteller,” he creates visions of  ,-
fabulous imagery ' inhabited by T /'
spirits, ghosts and gods assuming 7

hybrid-animal, human and vege-
table forms. . . ~ ‘ I

SAFE NUCLEAR WASTE
MANAGEMENT UPHELD

WASHINGTON (AP)-—The safe
management of radioactive wastes
given off in increased nuclear
‘energy production is feasible,
according to a federal government
report issued yesterday.

The report, prepared by the
Energy Resources Council, also
states that radioactive waste
volume is small, when compared
with other waste products, and that

“even substantial costs that could“-5»
be required for careful disposal 

such wastes will not have substan-
tial impacts on the cost of
electricity. ’ ’ »
“The means exist for reducing to
a very low level of risk each step in
the process,” said Commerce
Secretary Elliott L. Richardson, the
council’s chairman. “I don’t think

.anyone can say it is reduced to

zero, but...we can saylwe are.
dealing with a lower level of risk
than in other areas of energy

. production. ’ ’
