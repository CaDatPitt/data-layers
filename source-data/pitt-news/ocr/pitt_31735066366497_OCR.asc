v Speaker SaYS HUAC Able Party‘Unanimouslv 

Has No Constitutional
Basis for Existence

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO
The House Un-American Activities Committee- (HUAC)
should be abolished because it has no constitutional basis
 .-,e for its existence a spokesman for a national committee to

abolish HUAC told an audience of about 50 students Friday 1

afternoon. .

Frank Wilkinson, executive» director of the National
Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities
Committee, said that HUAC investigates only propaganda
and Congress is denied any constitutional power to do this.

“Congress has every right to in-

vestigate and regulate overt acts"

of subversion and espionage,” he
said, but “not ideas.” ~
Wilkinson, who was brought t
the University by law librarian
 Thomas Checkley spent one year
in prison for refusing to answer
questions before HUAC. He plead-
ed the First Amendment,‘ free
speech, but lost his case before
the Supreme‘ Court by a ﬁve to
four vote.- . -
Wilkinson quoted Chief Justice
Earl Warren’s deﬁnition of pro-
paganda as “something written
or spoken to communicate ideas.”
This is also free speech, Wilkin-
is/son said. “If- Congress has no
power to regulate freedom of
speech it has no power to have
a, committee to investigate it.”
The committee, he charged,
“acts as judge, jury, and,PI'0S€-
cutor” in its investigations. “Tes-
timony is based on assertions, not
fact,” he said. Because there is
, nojcross-examination or other ju-
dicial safeguards,
'-'~:'.'f~,-have due process of law.” This is

an inference of the legislative.

branch into the executive “and
judicial branches,” Wilkinson ex-
plained.

Testimony beforeiHUAC is not _

subject to libel laws because of
Congressional immunity. Testi-
mony has been used by groups
who “cannot be sued” even if the
-information is false. Wilkinson
V. gave as an example the use of
%testimony by certain groups in
 the South to cast a “Red smear”

against civil rights workers.
The next 13 months will be

critical in the anti-HUAC cam- ’

paign, he felt but he was conﬁ-
dent that “we’re going to abolish
the committee.”

Couples Lead
Boys Groups

A new experiment in club lead-
ership is being innovated in Jan-
uary by the University’s YMCA
in cooperation with the Home-.
wood-Brushton YMCA. Student
couples will work with young-
sters in poverty neighborhoods.

Volunteers are needed to lead
groups of approximately ten boys
each for 12 meeting during the
winter trimester.’ The club will
be organized at the couple’s con-
venience regarding time and day
for the Cmeetings. Leaders will
have the opportunity to work
with parents as an added feature
of this program.

Frank Watanabe, executive of

A the University YMCA, said, “The

students shouldn’t worry about
any special skills, as this a struc-
tured program and leaders will
be given the opportunity to im-
provise as much as they want.”

Moves To Dissolve, Disband

Able Party senators have
voted unanimously to dis-
band and dissolve, according
to Sen. Martin Engels, form-
er chairman of the Party.

“Since its inception four years
ago, the Able Party has made
many signiﬁcant contributions to
the student body through Stu-
dent Goverment,” Engels said.
Measures established by the Par-‘
ty include the Book Exchange
Proﬁt-Sharing Plan in the Uni-
versity ”Book Center, and the
Spirit Award, to name a few.
The history of the Able Party
reflects the sincere desire on the
part of its members to effectively
represent the students at the
University of’ Pittsburgh.”

Engels cited Sen. Barbara Stev-
enson’s successful efforts to pro-
vide study hours ‘ in Schenley
Cafeteria as “a recent example
of this philosophy of govern-
ment.”

“However,” Engels added, “we
have come to the inescapable
conclusion that under the pre-
sent conditions in Student Gov-
ernment_,_*_v_ve _ can not continue

‘this effective representation F of

‘the students by working unen-
cumbered by party bonds. One
of the importantreasons for the
failures of Student Government
this year has been the inability
of senators to cooperate amongst

themselves because of the re-'

strictions of artiﬁcial party loy-
arty.” — ‘-’
Engels stressed that “some con-

, structive efforts have been made

towards effecting cooperation.”

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER8, 1965 

He illustrated his point by ex-
plaining the genesis of the Hous-
ing Bill, which recently passed
the Senate. Sen. John Ruskay,
PPP chairman, and I realized
that the interests of Student Gov-
ernment and the students could
be best served by the establish-
ment of an independent commit-
tee to ‘study the dorrnitoryrules
for both men and women. Hope-
fully, this independent thinking
and cooperation will continue in
the future.”

Engels mentioned the new pro-
posed constitution as “one of the
areas where recent discussions
have proved that senators from
all factions are able to work to-
gether constructively towards con-
crete goals.” _

Hoelscher Criticizes’    
Circulation of Rumors

By BERNI McLEOD

Hoping to “put some
ghosts to rest,’3 Dr. Harold
Hoelscher, dean of the school

the noon meeting, Dean Hoel-

circulate erroneous facts and ru-
mors. “If you want to check

‘speaking on it, he noted that
although he favored the accredi ,_

felt that it should‘ be checked
“Chemical engineering is one 5o

professions,” said Hoelscher. “'0_f_-A’

spector do not specialize in ’th

Despite the loss of accredita,

Dr. Hoelscher turned the pro
gram over to Walter R. Turkes,

Dean Turkes noted that as of.
September, 1966, an eight-term
program would go into eﬂecjt‘
eliminating one trimester as ” j '3

Ibis Theatre Seen as Successful

By BILL JEROME
A genuine sense of comic tech-
nique and the unique intimacy of
a 72-seat theatre combined to
give the University Theatre’s pro-
duction of Mistress of the Inn a

The production could have been

it transformed 1001 CL-—a form-
er biology laboratory and sculp-
ture studio—into the Ibis The-
atre, which was in turn cleverly
transformed into an 18th Cen-

selves—remnants of a defunct
East Liberty movie house—rim-
med two sides of the stage, giv-
ing the audience a close look at

cess of comedy.

The play, written by Carlo
Goldoni, was an offshoot of the
slap-stick improvisations of the

characterized by stock characters
in stock situations. The mistress
of the inn, Mirandolina, is pur-
sued by The Count, who tries to
lure her with jewels, and The
Marquis, who ﬂowers her with

ready chosen Fabrizio, who also
works at the inn, to be her fu-
ture husband. To confuse things,
Fabrizio is reluctant to marry
her.

Now the Captain and his serv-

Captain veils his admiration for
Mirandolina behind a tough hide

women in general.
This makes him a challenge to
Mirandolina’s feminine wiles, for

her with compliments. His crude
approach contrasts with the court-
ly manner of the Count, the
effeminiate whining of the Mar-
quis, and the vacillation of Fabri-
zio—who. eventually out-ﬁnesses
everybody’s advances with his
retreats, as Mirandolina becomes
his bride.

The six characters were never
in search of laughter. Valerie
Stasik was convincing as the

The Panthers will plays Miami

and her ﬁamboyance was com-
plemented by the brusqueness of
William Phelps as the Captain.
The V obvious attraction-through-
repulsion between the two gave
vitality to a relationship that
might have otherwise been char-
acterized as the mere exposition
of two personalities.

Russell Bullitt added somedash
in the role of the Count, and his
vigor was humorously contrast-
ed with Jerry Weinstock’s silky
timidity as the Marquis. Eric
Michaels, who played the Cap-
tain’s servant, was similarly cf.-
fective in the portrayal of a
harmless but humorous pansy.

But by far the scene-stealer in
this production was Bob Horo-
witz who, in the role of Fabrizio,
was perhaps closest to the impro-
vised nature of the 18th century
commedia. His wide-eyed, toothy
expressions combined with what

' theatre itself was

director Dr. William H. Kingsley
called “a modiﬁed New York de-
livery“ which added moments Of
contemporary comedy and help-
ed accentuate the relevance of
the character-types to today's so-
ciety. '

The only drawback with this
production was that its run was
so short. The smallness of the
in this case
too much a strong point to be
blamed for the fact that only a
limited number could see the
production.

Perhaps the play will be re-
peated in the future, so that
more people can sit in the inti-
mate atmosphere of near-partici-
pation within the Ibis Theatre
and enjoy the effective simplicity
of this production. If not, one
can only congratulate Dr. Kings-
ley, the cast, and all those con-
nected with getting the Ibis off
to such a good start.

VVPDU Beats Alabama
\ In 34 - Team Tourney

University debaters Mike Smith
and Tom Zaucha won first place
over 34 college teams competing
in the 16th annual Pitt Cross-
Examination Tournament last
week-end, meeting and defeating
Alabama in the ﬁnal round.

Smith and Zaucha won ﬁve

and lost one in the preliminary,

rounds, accumulating a point to-
tal of 52 out of 60 possible quality
points. They took four of ﬁve
ballots over an Alabama affirma-
tive, which also won ﬁve and
lost one in the preliminaries.

Since University teams were
ineligible to receive trophies, the
Alcoa Traveling Trophy for the
ﬁrst-place school‘ went to. Ala-
bama, making it the second year
that Alabama has received the
Alcoa Trophy.

The Gulf Trophy for affirma-

tive teams was won by a. Cali- ,

fornia State College at Los An-

geles team. The negative trophy
winner, receiving the Jones &
Laughlin trophy,. was Clarion
State. College.

Repeating his victory of last
year, Professor Richard Huseman
of the University of Georgia won
the Rust Engineering Trophy as
the outstanding judge in the
tournament, based on nomina-
tions by the debaters.

I - Acting Chancellor Dr. Stanton Crawford
has given strong indications the University
cpgld soon be approaching a new affiliation
with the state of Pennsylvania. Crawford
gave his remarks as keynote speaker at
Monday night's’ Omicron Delta Kappa
(’ODK) Founder's Day Dinner.

- ‘Dr. Crawford’s comments centered
around the growing need of “large urban
Universities” to receive both public and
private support. He mentioned that this
University is not unique in this sense, but
that such a trend is evident in institutions
across the nation.

_, ’ He stressed the need for increased pub-
lic support to supplement private support,
while maintaining the integrity of the ur-
ban University as a private institution.
He then commented that the Board of
‘Trustees were meeting tomorrow and that
the Century club, a group of people giving
at least $100 yearly to the University,
would be, meeting Saturday.

" The Century Club dinner will also in-
clude members of the Charter Council, peo-
ple who contribute $1,000 or more yearly

man of the Board of Trustees Gwilym Price
will speak to the anticipated group of 500.
If such statements were taken as iso-
lated comments, there would be no need to
think a new type of State affiliation possi-
-ble, but the context of ‘Crawford’s speech
(and recent occurrences make the shift pos-
 sible. ‘ V

 The Pennsylvania State Legislature op-
erates under a system that in odd-numbered
-years it can deal only with appropriation
matters. In even years (i.e., 1966), the
legislature can handle only non-fiscal busi-
';1'lGSS.

 However,“ Governor William Scranton can
call a special session in an even-numbered
year to discuss fiscal matters. Other than
‘an extra appropriation this year, the state
-legislature has taken no definite action on
redefining the University’s relation to the

 l   The Wide

It has been a sad year for those of us
“ who enjoy watching our University strug-
gle ,to greatness. First. came the heart-
._‘_.breaking news that the coffers were empty;
{that the University did not have enough
;.v_1noney to buy Gus Miller’s, let alone the
frost of Oakland. Then followed the unfor-
tunate illness and subsequent resignation
'-of. our beloved champion, former Chancellor
-‘Edward Litchfield. We scientists among
.the observers, who know full well that trag-
edy always comes in threes, have been wait-
 ling several months for the final deal of fate
‘which would send our University reeling,
and at last it has come. Football is dying.
  _' In ‘the short space of :two years the great
_ football power of the University has slipped
’-._~from -second in the nation to umpteenth.
.—fThe), coach has been sacked. Only 16 fresh-
.,',men will join the ranks of upperclass grid-
gders next fall, while hundreds of talented
“local boys seek better deals elsewhere. Yet
gthe schedule has been set for the next ten
‘ years, and as usual, the University will con-
‘-jtinue to play teams with much greater
, depth and skill.

'\ SHALL FOOTBALL be eliminated? Or
3;,-will the University continue to be the fall-
 guy of college ball, the little chuckle that
comes when an alumnus of an opposing pow-
erhouse reads his schedule card? I say nei-
ther. In fact I say we can solve all of the
University’s problems and become the top
football power of’ the world all in one flying
-tackle. How, Easy. Turn pro.

have been to evaluate each school’s, relation
to the state and the effects on administra-

. tive operations and academic quality.

The Board of Trustees meeting tomor-
row is a special meeting not listed on the
University calendar. Also, Dr. Crawford
made special reference to the past help and
anticipated future help of Senator Edward
Pechan. Pechan is an ODK member, mem-
ber of the Board of Trustees, and State Sen-
ate majority whip.

Dr. Cralwford spoke of the need to main-
tain pace with the University’s anticipated
growth. He noted the need for more and
better quality faculty to teach the expected
boom in students. He also commented on
the‘ need for more dormitories, classroom
space, laboratories, and facilities to adjust
to an expected growth in University size
and population. ,

Crawford has odviously been doing his
homework behind the scenes. He could not

' have given such comments without having

»  choice,» that

been involved in serious long range analysis

of the University situation. . '
He also mentioned the unusual openness

of the trustees to discuss all matters,

through either formal or informal‘ means, _

with the faculty. Liberal arts are currently
being revised towards an entirely new ori-
entation; one. which might coorelate to an
increased state affiliation.

Of course, these _may all be incidental
factors having no »coir_relation.: or casual re-
lationship. But Dr. Crawford’s comments
before the many influential people at the
ODK banquet coupled with the special meet-
ings of the trustees and the Century Club
make a change in the University’s state re-
lation a possible outcome.

of football, college or professional, is more
exciting to watch, draws greater crowds,‘
and most important, makes more money?
Professional, of course. A pro franchise is
an investment just like the Ruskin Apart-
ments, and with the proper handling it can
make the University not only rich but also
famous. 

But there is uore than just" money to be
had from such an investment. A‘c’a.demic
standards neednot becompromised to aid
recruiting. "More scholarship money will be-
come available to the “minor” sports which
sorely need it. ‘And last butinot least ‘the
special talents of the professional football
players can be used to great advantage by
hiring them as staff members while they
play for the great-University team.

FOR INSTANCE, what better figure
can you think of as Chancellor than say,
Johnny Unitas? Surely he can handle the
Boardof Trustees with as much or greater
ease than he handles his own Baltimore
Colts on the field. And think of how much
prestige this great national figure will add
to our school when he appears in the Field
House advertising Vitalis. .

Think how few Owl cameras will be stol-
en if potential pilferers know that John
Henry Johnson and Bobby Bell are patroll-
ing Schenley Hall, -as Security forces of
course. And wouldn’t it be nice ‘to see Lou
“The Toe” Groza streamlining our burgeon-
ing bureacracy as head of personnel? ~

I feel that the University should con-

- sider the program I have outlined as a
means to solve the problems which now be-
set it. But the University must work with

 

,    guess, although you could-
n t prove it by me when I was little. My friends and I led
busy lives, too busy for such considerations; we were always
an gur way somewhere with the sameainstincts ‘as a flock of

1r s. j

The end of summer was always strange for us, a slip-

ping away beneath our feet, a trickery into November. The
stuffy summer air of my father’s exhalations, of the weed

patches in the backyard, of the fleas in the air, all the things
alive that we were close to thinned out in November, into
a transparency becoming atmosphere. In November, too, -
the uncongealed clouds allowed for clear skies, and in the
evening, after six’ o‘clock, the stars took over the streets. A
cold descended to the earth. ‘

OUR MOTHERS dressed us and we ventured into the
greying streets under layers of wool, cotton, and flannel; we
ventured, dressed and immobile, and our mothers grew exas-
perated at our returns and our returns. The tenements
across the street receded to a vast distance and then‘, in the
growing greyness of afternoon after afternoon of gathering-
clouds, they became shadows. . .

I don’t know why we went outside on those days of cold

boredom.V Even the birds’ strung along the net of wires 

above our heads knew enough not to move. Maybe We went

out on some sort of unspokendare; slum children have acute’ i

awareness of such things. Like Junior Mraz who came out
in November only to huddle out of the wind on the leeward
of the high concrete steps down the street. I know we went
out partly on faith. We had the sense that only children
have of the seasons; a knowledge, almost physiological, that
things would change even though we weren’t sure how.
And ‘every year our faith was justified. It snowed,

every year around Thanksgiving. In the evening, we

watched from windows the snow quietly gather for us in the
streets, stopping -dumb even the world of adulthood. The
next day, if there was no school, 'we*made snowballs, igloos,
and snowmen; we ran through it, rolled in it, and then plod-
(led through it; we washed in it and we ate it. _

BY CHRISTMAS week, if we were lucky,‘ it snowed
constantly so that -there was always clean, fresh snow that
older people hadn’t trampled to slush. We playedzin the
snow hard and desperately; by then it was nothing new,
but our minds and energies had to be taken away from the
odor of nutbread baking‘ and the squat Christmas trees our
fathers had brought home, away from the illusion of Christ-
mas that hovered in the distance at the top of the street-

Through it all there wassomething unbelievable about

Christmas; we all had solid guesses about Santa Claus, but

A:

still there was the presence of a mystery -that defied all-xﬁ

thought. I remember the orangeroad-grader in the window
of Markowitz’s grocery store across the street. ,Darkness
was falling about 5 :30, dinnertime, and I can recall playing
to exhaustion and hunger, then sauntering across the street
in the darkness to the window. And there it was. Standing
in those yellow trapezoids of light falling out across the
snow, I _ grappled with myself, the road-grader, and the
quarter-inch of glass between us. I wondered whose word
would make the grader mine. I was faintly aware that my

parents would pay Mr. Markowitz $6.95, a lot of money for '
me but not for them, and they could take the road—grader '-

home. But why would they want to give it to me? And their
having given it to me, would that make it mine? .

Then, the waking up on Christmas morning an’d"ﬁnding
that damn roadgrader under the tree andrwondering how_ it
got there. And the awareness that I had missed it again,
that something had remained undisclosed and impenetrable
for another year. 6 F
x Does that answer your question, Katherine?

Polaroid Co. Chooses Tri Delts  

To Demonstrate New Cameras

By BERNI McLE0D ‘

Polaroid Camera Company has
selected the University chapter
of Delta Delta Delta sorority to
be “Polaroid Camera Girls” and
demonstrate the new 1965 de-
luxe camera this yea!‘ in C00D€I"
ation with Joseph Horne’s.

Pittsburgh sales representative
Corvin R. Cianci gave four weeks
of lessons to the girls, costing
the company nearly $200 to train

each girl, and permitted them to
practice with the Polaroid cam-

, eras. The girls were supplied
with ﬁlm and equipment and per-

mitted to practice with Polaroids.

Once “experts,” the Tri-Delts
worked at Horne’s and its branch
stores, taking random color pho-
tographs of passing shoppers.

 “We foundthat people love to

have their pictures taken,” re-
marked Kathy Mancini, Tri-Delt
publicity chairman.

Wearing “Miss Polaroid Cam-
era Girl” banners,ithe‘ Tri-Delts
concentrated on taking portrait
pictures, and took repeat “shots”
if the subject was particularly
photogenic. Prizes were awarded
for the best pictures during the
training period and at the stores.
To date members have won ﬁlm

and Polaroid “Swinger” Camer-
as. In addition, the sorority was
awarded a Deluxe Instamatic
Camera and a $600 color televi-
sion for their suite. '

Although the girls found most
of their “subjects” were cooper-
ative, being a salesgirl took some

Despite swollen feet, most real-
ly enjoyed their role as Polaroid
Camera Girls. As Kay Frawley,
Tri-Delta president, remarked, “I
felt that this project gave us a
fair idea of what the world of
business is like—it was an inter-
esting glimpse into the future.”

off guard. One member, mistak-
ing a carton full of clothes for
a waste recepticle, threw all her
ﬁlm wrappers in. Others didn’t
realize how much strain it can
be to stand for a full working
day.

. By BILL JEROME

The recent craze for the
“camp” culture and trivia
contests (“What vehicles
combined to form Howdy
. Doody’s Aerodoodle?”) has
helped to revive interest in
the comic strips, radio serials,
and early sound movies. And
withthe death of Stan Laurel—
one-half of the Laurel and Hardy
comedy team—fans of this last
great comic duo, spanning the
era of silent and sound ﬁlms,
-have increased the demand for
_seeing again the movies that
were instrumental in forming the
style of cinema comedy.
. Laurel and Hardy’s Laughing
‘ Twenties, now at the Guild, is a
collection of silent ﬁlms that pro-
V -vducer Robert Youngson hopes to
use as proof that the team’s best
comedy came before the sound
era. Unfortunately, or fortunate-
ly, there is no way to prove such
a premise, so the ﬁlm must be
viewed solely for its documen-
tary and entertainment value.

Its documentary value is seen
in the ﬁrst segment, which shows
comedian “Babe” Hardy —- as he
was then known—in a romantic
scene from a 1915 silent. This
was 12 years before his partner-
ship with Stan Laurel, who orig-
inally began as understudy to

Pitt News Review ’

Laurel and Hardy’s Laughing

Charlie Chaplain. The pair’s‘ ﬁrst
movie—45 Minutes from - Holly-
wood—then appears, although in
this ﬁlm they never appeared in
the same scene together.

Other milestones shown are_

their ﬁrst film as a team—Put-
ting Pants on Philip and From
Soup to Nuts—in which they
ﬁrst portrayed the now familiar
derbied characters of “Stan” and
“Ollie.” It is in these early ef-
forts that we see the screen re-
lationship emerging between the
two, a relationship that was, if
anything, made comically more
ﬂexible and eifective with the ad-

 

dition of sound.

But this isn’t a slight at Laur-
el Hardy’s silent techniques which
stood them well in the transition
to the talkies. The use of slap-
stick sight gags, pie throwing,
and a mastery of pantomine ex-
pressions remained funny then
and remain funny today. Seeing
these elements in their embryon-
ic cinema states makes Laughing

Twenties‘ historically interesting ~

as well as entertaining.

The ﬁlm, which features Jay
Jackson’s narration and music by
Skeet Alquist, is not limited to
Laurel and Hardy. It also shows

Twenties  

some of their contemporaries-
Charlie Chase, Max Davidson,
etc.—in action, in ﬁlms from the
now-defunct Hal Roach Studios.
The optical clarity of the ﬁlm,
the music and narration, and the
delight in’ seeing the well-exe-
cuted slapstick of Stan and Ollie-
make The Laughing Twenties a
worthwhile tribute to silent com-
edy.

Being Frank
By FRANK SMZIZIK
Sports . Editor

It was N P I Day at the
University on Monday. N .P.I.
doesn’t stand for Nothing
Particularly Interesting or
Nine Pregnant Indians, but
means New Pitt Image.

. Changing this image is the_

job that faces Dave Hart,

newly appointed, head foot-

ball coach.

He will have to recruit. The
high school coaches in thisiarea
will have to be convinced that
this is the school where they
should tell their boys to come.

' He has to contact the boys and

convince them, himself. He was
an excellent recruiter as -an assis-

that faces him now is areal chal-
lenge to his skills.

It will be a difficult job be-ll

cause he won’t have the budget
he had to work with at Navy,
and he won’t have the tradition
of the Naval Academy, to pull in

"players. He will have high aca-

demic standards in his way and
will have to ﬁght all the bad pu-
blicity the ‘University has got-
ten. Can he do it‘? "\‘
His new boss Frank Carver
seems to think. so. “Dave is very
_poised and articulate, and is
young and aggressive. He was
well liked by the players at Navy
and everywhere, _he_ has coached,’’_
With Hart’s appointment Carver
is trying to deal with the re-
cruiting problems that have
plagued the football program for
the last few years. .

 

ave Hart,

J’?

     

   

DAVE HART
Will Begin Immediately
As a coach, Hart has 15 years
experience — four as a college as-

.‘ sistant and '11 as a head coach in
tant coach at Navy, and the job _

Pennsylvania high schools. He
then knows this area and where

V the best players ‘are’ found. This

is what we need.

‘We also" have to worry about
next years record. “I told Dave
that a lot of good men will grad-
uate, but we still want a repre-
sentative team. Other than this
we haven’t talked about any spe-
ciﬁc changes,” said Carver. Hart

 

 
     

won’t be back in Pittsburgh until
tomorrow so he couldn’t be reach-
ed for any comments about
changes he intends to make.

The present assistant coaches
are still under contract until July
31. Carver has said that they will
remain in an advisory capacity
until then, although he has stated
that the new coach will be able
to pick his own staff.

Carver may have given the
new coach a free hand in picking
his staff, but it wouldn’t» be sur-
prising if Bimbo Cecconi still re-
mained as an assistant next sea-
son. He had considerable support
from alumni for the head coach‘
ing position and they may be ap-
peased by the rehiring of Cec-
coni.

With a brand new coaching
staff the 38-year-old Hart is
young enough to be the ‘morale
booster that the Panthers need.
He has only been coaching col-
lege ball for four years, yet has
made a name for himself as a re-

cruiter. He may be just as eﬂ’ec- ‘

tive as a young high school coach
trying to make a name for him-

,self or a big name- coach who

may not have the desire. to re-
build a crumbled empire.

When he graduated from St.
Vincent, Hart was appointed head
coach at Hurst High School, Mt.

    

Pleasant, Pennsylvania, and, later,
head coach and Athletic director
at J ohnstown, Pennsylvania, High
School. His Johnstown teams
compiled an eight year record of
63- 12 -2 against Pennsylvania’s
top schoolboy teams, and over
one span won 27 straight.
These are pretty fair credits to
go along with his two years at
the Naval Academy and two
years at the University of Ken-
tucky. But the ‘alunmi associa-
tions may frown at a St.-Vincent
graduate. An alumnus is always
preferred. Hart, however, does
have a masters degree from the
University of Pittsburgh:

get some offense off the bench
when we want it. He may even
break into the starting lineup for
Friday night.”

Timmons receives his scouting
reports about the Miami squad
today. He already knows that
they dropped a 83-73 decision to
Cincinnati last Saturday.

“That doesn’t mean anything,
because we won't be able. to have
any team respect us unless we
can start hitting the open out-
side shots,” Timmons explained.
“The 15-20 foot jump or push
shot must be made. , I

Matmen Injuries
Penalize Rookie =
Coach Johnson

By TOM SACKS
New wrestling coach Dave
Johnson will be starting the
season off with his best foot
forward. He has no other

choice now that two of his
top wrestlers—Rich Shildt (123)
and Clare Riley (155) — have
come up with broken hands three
weeks before the season opener
at temple.

Riley one of the three return-
ing lettermen from last year’s 4-6
squad will most likely miss the
ﬁrst several meets. Sophomore
Shildt won his weight division in
las_t year’s Plebe tournament.

Heading the mat roster is Dino
Boni (145), winner of the East-
ern Collegiate title last year. The
other letterman is Tony Liberati
(123).

One of the weakest spots in
the wrestling line-up last year
was in the upper weight divi-
sions where the matmen where
consistently outpointed. Johnson
is hoping that three sophomores
will provide the remedy this sea-
son. ‘ 3‘ _

Jack Williams won the 192
pound division crown in the
freshman tournament last year at
Navy. He and sophomore Terry
Hoover will most likely be al-
ternating between the 192 divi-
sion and the heavyweight spot.

At 177 pounds Johnson will be
banking on Randy Kahler, who
also won his weight division title
at Annapolis.

The wrestlers lost seven let-
termen from last year’s squad
along with coach Rex Peery.

North Carolina State vis-
its Trees Pool and coach Ben
Grady’s swimmers this Sat-
urday at 3 p.m. It will be the
tankmen’s last home meet until
January.

In the last two dual meets be-
tween the two contingents, State
has managed to edge Mermen
twice. In the 1963-64 season,
State won, 49-46, while last year’s
meet ended 52-43.

Last week, the swimmers met
a solid corp of- Michigan State
swimmers. The Spartans won 90-
33, but Grady could learn little
from this meet.

“It’s too early ‘to determine

Swimmers Seel<iFirst Win  
Saturday Against N.C. State

they hold themselves back,”
Grady said. “They like to reach
a peak about the middle of Feb-
ruary or the beginning of March.”

For swimmers, the beginning of
March means the big meets, the
Easterns and the Nationals. Last
year, however, the swimming
team sent no one’ to these meets.
No one on the team could quali-
fy.

Andy James almost did, and
this year he may have made it,
but James came across an acute
case.of broken armitis before the
season began. With James'out of
action for the. ﬁrst meet, ‘the
swimmers were hurting in the
