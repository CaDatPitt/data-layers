 Acting Chancellor I{urtzman Sees
 State Relaitedness As Necessity;

Standards To

(See editorial, guage 4)
By JON SCHWARTZ

“The future of higher educa-
tion, generally, lies in more and
more governmental support,” stat-

-u ed Acting Chancellor David H.

Kurtzman at the 3 p.m. coffee
hour speech in the Student Union
Ballroom Thursday. Dr. Kurtz-.
man, answering numerous ques-
-tions on the topic, ‘-‘The Student
and the State,” deﬁned the Uni-
versity’s position concerning the

proposed state-relatedness.
Beginning the‘ meeting with a_
brief explanation of his aims as
 acting chancellor, Dr. Kurtzman
' asserted that in order to balance
the University’s budget, “one
. must balance not only its in-
come,‘ but also its program.” He
guaranteed the students and fac-
ulty that his major goal was to
,. continue to build the ﬁne aca-

demic standing of the Univer-

A sity. . A
In addition to private funds,”
Dr. Kurtzman explained, .f‘_’ghe ,

 University will need a govern-
mental source of‘:revenue."’ He‘
stressed that state-relatedness did
not mean complete state control
of the University. Using the Penn-
sylvania State University as an
example, he said that even schools
which are highly-dependent on
state funds are, operating inde-
pendent of a major state inﬂu-
I ence.
 Dr. Kurtzman was infavor of
 having as few government-ap-
‘pointed members of the Univer-
sity’s Board of Trustees as possi-
ble..However Dr, Kurtzman said,‘
“The "government-appointed Trus-
tees can even “ compliment orur
ow_n Board of Trustees, since they
,will represent the community and
" ‘bring in~‘new approaches to the
Board.” ‘ V
He maintained that the fear of _
 politicians sitting on the*Unive’r-
' ’ sity Board is unfounded. He des-
cribed three present board mem-
bers, Governor Scranton, Mayor
Barr, and ex-Governor Lawrence

as men “very devoted to the Uni- _

- versity.”
Dr. Kurtzman stated that he
was opposed to making out-of-

2

 

state students pay at least three
times as much as instate stu-
dents. He thought that since the
state will only be paying the
University the amount -which it
will lose when the tuition of
Pennsylvania students is reduced
($1,450 to $450), "the University
should be allowed to set the tui-
tion prices of out-of-state stu-
dents, “an area where the state
‘dollar is not involved.” He said
that he was in favor of a 'lower
-state to out-of-state tuition ratio_
3-1 and that the University should
encourage not, discourage out-of-
state students to enroll here. ,
Speaking onthe possible change
in -the trimester plan, Dr. Kurtz-
man maintained that in. order
for the University to admit al-
.most 1,000 new students over a
span of_ several years the general
trimester plan must be used.
“Due to a lack of facilities, the
only way this /increase in the stu-

dent body can be accommodated B

he said, but added that “the pre-
sent trimester system will have
to be rearranged as far as the cal-
endar is concerned.”

The subject then turned to the
admissions policy of the Univer-
sity. Referring to an admissions
office "report, Dr. Kurtzman stat-
ed that there were a number of '
well-qualiﬁed “high school ,stu-‘
dents in the Pittsburgh area alone
who could not attend the Univer-
sity because of the present high
tuition. If these students are able
to attend the University under a
state-planned tuition decrease,
“the present admission standards,

of course, will not be lowered,” ’

he said.

Kurtzman told the audience that

Program

President‘ J ohnsdn has de-
cided to reinstate the Na-
tional Defense Education
Acts’ student loan program
in the 1967 federal budget.
The $180 million program
had been deleted from the
budget in line With the Pres-
ident’s determination to cut
‘ down Federal aid programs.
The President’s decision

was made in the light of
Congressional dissatisfaction with
his domestic budget, according to
The New York Times. “There is
a strong bipartisan move afoot
in.Congress,” said the Times, “to.
restore many of the Federal aid
programs that President Johnson,
1' in his budget released in Jan-
uary, had sought —to wipe out or
drastically curtail.” '
Johnson had intended to re-‘
place the National Defense loans
with a Federal Insured Loan
(FIL) program, whereby a stu-
dent could borrow ‘up to $1,000 a
year from private ﬁnancial

FIL, the following rules would
have applied: (1) for parents

the government would pay six
per. cent interest per year until
the student graduates, (2) nine
months after the student grad-
uated, he would have begun pay-
ing three per cent interest and
the government would pay three
per cent, and (3) the borrower
would have ten years to complete
payment of the principle.

spective villages, the United

this proves that the Viet Minh

Tabulation of the Project
Teach questionnaire has re-
cently been completed and
the results will be available
sometime before the March
21 opening date for registration
for the fall trimester.

Although over 1,500 question-
naires were turned in, there was
not enough information.to give
an adequate evaluation of very
many courses, according to com-
mittee chairman Allan Guggen-
heim.

The information from the ques-
tionnaries, which were published
in The Pitt News in January, will
be niimeographed and distributed
free to any interested students.
Each page will contain a reprint
of the original questionnaire for
each course with the numerical
results to each question. The back
of each page will contain com-
ments by the professors who
taught the course.

This type of format, instead of
the intended reprinted booklet
with written evaluations of the
various courses, is entirely due
to the generally poor response,
Guggenheim reported. Less_ than

uates responded, in spite of the
fact that evaluation forms were

. readily available and the entire
readily. available.

\ Students are. warned to take
this information as just as report
on the results of the question-
naires, not as a complete critical
analysis of the'courses. .

“No. As a matter of fact I have never

Editor, The Pitt News:

The sports pages of the Feb.
28 -issue of The Pitt News were
very disappointing. Two pages

.’ were used to describe the lost

games in four varsity sports.
I think-the editors should use

.a little more common sense. Since V y

the newspaper is for University
students (and, not for," the stu-

dents who beatus)‘, losses should I

be given miniiinum space in the
paper, especially in such_ lopsided
cases as on Monday.

The editors are capable of giv-
ing better support to. the teams
and the school. The whole stu-
dent body feels like a loser when
we have such poor editing as in

,Monday’s sports section.

‘Disgusting’ Habits

Editor, The Pitt News:

Why do some .college students
have to be so ‘utterly disgusting?
That’s how I.feel about the stu-
dent who throws hen, (I think it
was a her!) match «and cigarette
over her shoulder when sitting
(on a couch inked with choice
words) beside an ashtray‘. Or
what about the guy--who thinks
it’s cute to have a snack. table
slopped with food including a
paper napkin soggy with choco-
late milkshake? -Or those who
use the lobby floors and eleva-
tors (also inked with choice
words), foreverything, shreds of
last week’s exams to an orange
peel. , ;

But ‘the _most disgusting are
the students who insist on mix-
ing everything from wet strands
01' Spinach to melting strawberry
ice cream in the middle. of a
P1ate—_.-which is then left behind
011 3 tray. I once wondered who
the People were who left such
messes in the cafeteria and con-
cluded it must‘ be freshmen men

_“——then I saw two graduate wom- - '
"en (7) also walkout empty hand-

ed with their table covered with

. food.

teria it's,often impossibleito ﬁnd

7 _.tr.aYS.- of -half-eating 'dryjng.'.f°oqs ‘

It really wouldn’t be so difficult
to do and would certainly im-
prove the dinner hour ‘immeas-
urably. ‘ A. ‘-

Revised Psalm,
Editor, The Pitt News‘:

I found the following in a col-
lege newspaper. ‘I believe it was
Michigan State University but I
don’t know its author.

You may agree with me that
curves are certainly very useful
even at the University where
really good “curves” are appar-

ently quite scarce:

The Curve is my Shepherd-

I shall not worry

I alloweth me to sleep“ through
class . V "

It leadeth me to believe in
false intelligence ,

It restoreth my self-respect

It leadeth me in -the path of
hard courses for prestige’s
-sake

Yea, though I walk through the
valley of F's-

I shall (fear no “draft.”

For the curve is with me

The. median and the mean,
they comfort me , A

It prepareth a grade scale be-
fore me‘ in the presence of
the Administration

It anointeth my grade point
with B’s

My honor pointsf runneth over

Surly goodness—-—my transcript
shall I

Folow me, all the days of my
life’ - ‘

And I shall dwell in the house
of curves <

Forever.

_ Aslone who has himself bene-I ’

ﬁtted from the NDEA loan pro-
gram, I can sympathize with the
plight of the students who now
ﬁnd their loan funds about to be
cutioﬁ“ (See story page 1.) '

Nonetheless, I am not impress-
edby the anguished tone of your
front-pageeditorial and news ar-

. ticle, in the Feb.. 28 issue, deal

ing -with the’-abrupt termination
of the NDEA program.‘ Last tri-

_ mester The Pitt News took little

trouble to disguise its sympathy

\ for what was itself a thinly-veil-

ed endorsement of ‘the Adminis-
tration’s War in Vietnam, in the
form of noon rally held by the
allegedly clean-cut majority‘ to
demonstrate their patriotism and
right-thinking.

Now that you have tested‘sor'ne~3%'

_of the domestic fruits‘ of that
war —- which is, of course, the
fundamefital reason for the bud-
get cut curtailing the loan pro-
gram —- and found them bitter,
you scream in protest. Too bad
that all of your wisdom is of the
retrospective variety!‘ Per-haps

V next time you will not be so

.eager to enlist the University stu- '
dent body in a_ war all of whose I

consequences‘ you have not for-__
seen.

If, in fact, your major concern
were with the welfare of Univer--
sity students, you might even
have the courage to point out the



numerous other ways in which‘

, this totally unnecessary and in-

defensible military aggression
Amakes a mockery of any so-call-
ed Great Society, so far as, the

lowly student is concerned. I am , I

not, however, holding my breath
in anticipation. '

5;’ Swimming Team Closes Season;
Shoots Down .Air Force, 58-37

Backstroker J,oe

By GEORGE LIES _ 3
LeViere opened—up a seven-yard lead

on the ﬁrst leg of the 400-yard medley relay. From that
moment until the last, even wings could not have helped the

Air Force Academy against the
swimming team at Trees Pool last
Saturday. The victory, 58-37, was
their fourth in 12 encounters.

For the graduating seniors, it
was their last college meet. All of
them contributed to the win. Co-
captain Don Hahnfeldt nursed his
seventh high board diving vic-
tory, outpointing the Air Force
All-American Dan McLean, 249-
229. _

Senior Andy James pulled up
a winner in the 50-yard freestyle.
James also placed second to
teammate Gary Martin in the
100-yarder besides swimming on
the winning 400-yard freestyle
relay team.

In what had to be the most ex-
citing meet of the ‘season, the

mermen won eight of 11 events.-

John Lane, ywho swam the first’
100—yards of the freestyle relay,

, managed to win the 200 and the

500-yard freestyle events (again).

Breaking through the mermen’s
monopoly of the events was Air
Force’s Ron Grabbe and Steve
Seigler. Grabbe won the 200-yard
butterﬂy, the weakest spot in the
mermen’s lineup.

Seigler ﬁrst grabbed the 200-

yard individual medley. Then in
the 200-yard breaststroke, he
broke the pool record by 7.2 sec-
onds with a time of 2:15.22. “He is

the best breaststroker in the na-
tion,” coach Ben Grady said.

Despite the win, Grady cited one
of the main weaknesses of the
team-talent. “Two boys, (Chris)

.Price and (Dick) Hulme swam

the best time they,have ever,
but still they can’t place,” he
said. “Over the season, Price low-
ered his individual medley time
from 2:40 to 2:15. It’s just that
these boys aren’t good enough.”
