UNIVERITY or PITTSBURGH

Posvar observes
.mutual trust as A
one key to peace

By Diane Wolf
For The Pitt News

 The importance of mutual trust
iljetween Soviets and Americans
was stressed by Pitt President
Wesley Posvar at the closing
ceremonies of Chautauqua on
Friday.

Posvar’s remarks opened the
brief ceremony, which also
featured comments from Daniel

Bratton, president of the
Chautauqua Institution, and
Valentina Tereshkova,

chairwoman of the presidium of
the Union of Soviet Friendship
Societies.

Posvar said the United States
and the Soviet Union are bound
by shared responsibilities,
including avoiding nuclear war
and exploring outer space.

“We not only can work
together,” Posvar said, “but the
noint is that we must work

Ether. No other combination

. _ta_tions possesses our means

ad responsibility to do so.”

’ According to Posvar, the
practical outcomes of the
conference may be seen when
Mikhail Gorbachev and George

Bush meet at a December summit.
He pointed out that leaders
representing both nations at
Chautauqua will be briefing the
heads of state.

“Our conference was politics
come to life,” Posvar said.

Posvar asked the! American and
Soviet delegates to think of
Chautauqua as “an international
episode” where two nations
continued to grow together.

“We are no longer dealing with
forces that collide,” he said, “but
in terms of impulses that attract.”

Bratton emphasized that the
mutual attraction Posvar spoke
of wasn't always present,
describing the atmosphere at the
first Chautauqua conference in
1985 . as “frighteningly
contentious.” .

“There were many risks in
continuing,” Bratton said, “yet
we didn’t stop. Our efforts grew
with the Soviet and United Statesi
agendas. We didn’t give in to the
risks.” ‘

Bratton and Posvarboth praised
the decision to expand the agenda
of the fifth Chautauqua
conference to include topics such

Bradley calls Soviet
achanges 'remarkable'

By Chris Bosak'
Contributing Editor

When U.S. Senator Bill Bradley
visited the Soviet Union lastApril,
he asked a 12-year-old boy what
Perestroika meant to him.

The blond-haired, blue-eyed
A.‘-,_z.,outh said it meant a “beginning

 new life."
}.;?‘§.i.‘1ccording to Bradley, this new
geginning is already underway.

.{'*~Wl1en he spoke at a Chautauqua

conference two years ago, he
addressed numerous problems
that Soviet society faced at the
time. Last Friday at Chautauqua
at Pitt_, Bradley reviewed the
progress made by the Soviet
Union concerning these
questions, calling it “remarkable.”

For example, freedom of travel
is no longer restricted to a few

1”‘ privileged Soviets. Soviet leaders

are allowing Eastern European
nations to make their own political
decisions. Soviet history is being
taught truthfully with major
political cover—ups being
exposed. And workers in the
Soviet Union now have a stronger

E pole in independent trade unions.

There was also a positive
answer to Bradley’s question
about whether Soviet youths

V would be able to openly protest
the war on Afghanistan, similar
to the way young Americans
reputed the Vietnam conﬂict.

According to Bradley, great
strides have also been made for
individual religious freedom for
Soviet citizens. Some Catholics

’ still cannot publicly practice their
beliefs, but Bradley said this I

could also change after an
upcoming meeting between
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and Pope John Paul II.

But two of Bradley’s important
questions remain unanswered:
Will Soviet people soon be able
to make their own choices about
what to buy, sell and make? And
will fewer resources go to military
build-up? A

“These questions are central
to the success or failure of
Perestroika," said Bradley.

Bradley summed up the Soviet

progressby saying, “They are a '

long way from genuine
democracy, but it. has begun.

Everyone has played along
game of monopoly before, but
how many have played for two

This weekend the Sigma

monopoly continuously for 48
hours in the Towers Lobby. The
game was held to raise money
for the American Heart
Association, the fraternity’s
national charity. 4

Sigma Alpha Mu's fund-raising
campaign, called “Bounce for
Beats," - was traditionally a
dribble-a-thon, but according
to Mark Holfrichter, coordinator
of the marathon, ,“that ‘was

boring and annoying."

“It was rumored a long, long
time ago, that our chapter

- [played monopoly] before, [and]

we thought it would be fun,"
said Hoffrichter. .
The money raised came from
pledges made on the basis of
hours played. There were also
donation cans at the game site.

“We estimate making
between $2,000 and $4,000,"
Hoffrichter said. i A

Two game boards were
donated by Parker Bros. Over
95 percent of the fraternity
members participated,
committing themselves to seven
hours of game play. a

Others became obsessed. “I'll

Soviet and U.S. doctors link alcoholism to heredity  

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Children of alcoholics are four
times more likely to develop
alcoholism than others, even
when adopted and raised by non-
alcoholic parents.

This statistic, introduced by
American scientist Marc Schuckit
of the Veteran’s Administration
Alcohol Research Center, was one
of many shocking findings
exchanged by Soviet and
American scientists that link
alcohol and drug addictions to a
person’s genetics.

The scientists, taking part in a

Chautauqua at Pitt workshop "

Thursday afternoon, said they
have not yet pinpointed the exact
gene combination that triggers

alcoholism.

“It is not a simple mode of
inheritance. It’s likely to be a
group of genes. It’s going to be
very difficult to figure out the
genetics,” said Schuckit.

' A number of studies have
been conducted over the past 20
years to analyzethe relationship
between alcohol and drug
addictions and a person’s
biological make—up. One study
Schuckit conducted tested a

sample of 474 men 18 to 25 years I

old. Results showed that after
consuming a few alcoholic drinks,
the sons of alcoholics were less
likely to feel the effects of the
alcohol even though their blood-
alcohol levels were the same as
the other subjects.

M “In a society like ours and [in]

the Soviet Union, where drinking
heavily is very common, being
sensitive to one, two, or three
drinks is good, so you know
when to stop. Having less of a
response to alcohol makes it much
more likely you’ll have problems
in the future,” said Schuckit.
Schuckit is now following up
on the data collected from the
men to attempt to make a theory
correlating the decreased ability
to feel alcohol to making one
more susceptible to alcoholism.
Vladimir Poltavets, chairman
of a Soviet Medical Institute’s
psychiatry department, presented
findings similar to Schuckit’s.
“The children of alcoholics have
biological differences from other
children even before they come
in contact with alcoholics,” he

said.

However, not all children of
alcoholics receive the “gene
loading” that can cause
alcoholism, according to George
Vaillant, a professor of psychiatry
at Dartmouth University's medical
school. He said the number who
receive the genes is one—half at
most. Vaillant also said that the
“number of alcoholics in a
person’s family tree does not
predict [at] what age alcoholism
will develop.”

Since scientists cannot tell if
one has inherited the weakness
to substance abuse, Vaillant said
that all people who come from
alcoholic families “should drink
much more carefully” than others.

The scientists also talked about
how a person’s environment can

Abortion considered a medical ’ problem

Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

Soviet and American women
united to discuss the reproduction
problems facing women in both
societies at a Chautauqua plenary
session on Thursday.

Wanita ‘ Bratton,
psychotherapist for the
Chautauqua County Mental
Health, Clinic, was the U.S.
moderator. Zoya Zarubina and.
Yevsey D. Krasik, director ‘of
psychiatry and medical
psychology at the T ornsk Medical
Institute, and the onlygmale on
the panel, were the Soviet
moderators.   V

Bratton opened the session
enthusiastic ‘about discussing
women's reproduction problems
by commending the Soviet Union
for their growing awareness of
these problems. She also specified
that “this is not another name for
abortion rights.” _

Although abortion was a main
issue, the discussion_also included

Superpowers criticize foreign policies

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer .

“Going against the spirit of

cooperation in Chautauqua at Pitt, ,

both the American and Soviet.
speakers openly criticized each
other’s policies, in “Solving
Regional Conﬂicts."

Both Paul Wolfowitz, U.S.
undersecretary of defense for
policy and Nikolai Shishlin, a
senior staff member of the

Communist Party of the Soviet .

Union Central Committee,
attacked each other’s policies over
the superpowers’ roles in these
conﬂicts; ,

“Although their withdrawal
from Afghanistan offers promise,”
Wolfowitz said, “there is still
evidence of old thinking in the
Soviet Union’s policy .toward

, regional conﬂicts.”

Shishlin countered that
argument with a question:
“Whose missiles are killing old
men, women and children in
Afghanistan?" He answered, “Not
the ‘mujaheddin,’” the Afghan
resistance group.

Shishlin also ’ asked,» “Which

country has severed all ties to_

issues such as contraceptives,
prenatal care, drug and alcohol
abuse, teenage pregnancy and
the abortion pill. ‘

Krasik said that the Soviet Union
was “implementing solutions to
the problem of reproduction.”
He also said that, although

- reproductive decisions are “the
prerogative of the woman, the

man involved should also have
something to do with it.”

The discussion began with

“We've rcorrie a long way. In

~- the’ past, a baby born 12 weeks

early did not have much of a
chance. Now a baby born at 2.2
pounds has a 98 percent chance
of survival,” said Powderly.

But, she also mentioned health
problems for poor and minority

Cuba? Not the Soviet Union,”
causing the crowd to react as if he
had struck a blow.

Wolfowitz also attacked Soviet
inﬂuence in North Korea;

“North Korea is repeatedly
taking part in state-supported
terrorism,” he claimed, “and the

Soviet Union continues to supply I

them with surface—to-air missiles
and ﬁghter jets.”

. Shishlin, however, did notbring
up this subject in his speech.

. Wolfowitz also criticized the

I Soviets for their role in Nicaragua.

“The Sovie“ts'“have been giving
$500 nrilliofr  aid to Nicaragua
per year, and almost three billion
dollars since 1980,” he said. ~

Wolfowitz also called. for the
public to get involved in the
Soviet Union. _

“I call for public scrutiny for

arms transports from the Soviet _

Union,” he said. .
‘Shishlin said thatihe doubted

' that his government _would

women.

“They are at higher risk because
they are neglected after the babies
are born,” Powderly said.

Another issue was mothers who
are drug and alcohol abusers.
These expectant mothers are often
turned down for rehabilitation.

"‘Health—care providers are
frustrated seeing babies suffer,

but is the answer prosecuting S

these women, or better health
care?,” Powderly asked.
“The main objective of society
is to make sure that only welcome

she said.

Shishlin defended his‘ country's
policies by saying, “We cannot
stay as an isolationist nation. Self-
isolation would be a criminal
luxury:”

Wolfowitz was criticized by the
audience a couple of times.

When asked about arms

, shipments and their significance

to our economy, he replied,
“There is no dependence of our
economy on arms exports.”_This
drew a general sound of
disapproval from the mostly
American crowd. _

Later on, Wolfowitz was called
“hypocritical” for attacking the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
while supporting the Contras in
Central America.

He responded, “Yes, our
country does have its misgivings.
But nothing we have to admit to
is equivalent to the invasion of
Afghanistan."

Shishlin was not free from the
criticism, either. When asked
about granting freedom for the

Baltic /States, he stated that his 4

country is working very hard to
“control the situation.”

“Family planning emphasizes
prevention, especially in young

people and women over 35. But A

because of publication problems,
it is difficult to establish family
planning in all regions,” Smetnik
said.

Throughout her speech,
Powderly stressed the abortion
problem. In the Soviet Union,
she said, women often have
between ﬁve and seven abortions.

Unlike the United States, she
said, the main concern with
abortion in the Soviet Union is
not morality.

.. According to “Krasik, “The;

Church is beginning to playa
more important role in our
country. In the future this will
affect [the number of woman
having abortions]. We consider it
a national“ disaster; we want to
make abortions the exception,
not the rule.” '

addicts. -Schuckit said that
sometimes environment is
positive enough to squelch any
genetic weaknesses, just as a bad
environment can help cause
alcoholism in people without the
genetic risk. “
' Vaillant shot down the widely
accepted belief that alcoholism is
usually brought on by serious
problems in a person’s life, such
as lack of responsibility.

“It’s the disease that leads to
these devastations, not the other
way around," he said. “That's
why I think psychotherapy is the
worst way to recover, because it
tries to find the underlying

“ problems that lead to alcoholism,
but really ’ it’s the alcohol that

causes them.”

said Smetnik.

Smetnik also said that sex’

education is very important -

“I feel that education starts at a 
late age, seventh or eighth grade. .

I think it should start earlier at
home and at school," Smetnik
said. ‘

AIDS in the Soviet Union was
another topic of discussion!

According to Krasik, “the problem, , '
of AIDS is a high priority, we’ve ,

had 300 reported cases.
Fortunately, knock on wood, no
pregnant women have been
discovered to be a carrier of AIDS. ”

 The most common venereal
disease in the Soviet Union is . 
gonorrhea. When asked if the

Soviet Union promotes the use of
condoms, Krasik replied, “It is a

good idea for men to wear a.
condom because itcould prevent __ —l

venereal disease.”

After the speeches were over -

Smetnik announced, “It seems

that Soviet and American woman .

have a lot in common.”

U.S.S.R. social stucturesi,
hinder economic reform 

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Despite economic problems
in the Pittsburgh area and the
Soviet Union in general, the
future looks promising for both
regions, experts said Thursday
at the Chautauqua workshop,
“Comparison of Regional
Economic Restructuring.”

Dr. Vijai P. Singh, director of
Pitt’s University Center for Social
and Urban Research, said that

global competition has hurt the '

Pittsburgh region, which was
‘once the steel capital of the
world. ' ‘

However, he added that
figures which show
unemployment in this area as
being slightly below the national
average are misleading due to
current population trends here.

“From 1960 to 1988 we have
been losing population,” Singh
said. “And there is a close
relationship between
population trends and economic
trends.” .

Singh called it “disturbing”
that in 1988, 24,910 people in
the workforce between 15 and
24 years of age left this area.

As far as job growth, Singh
called the impact “uneven” but
added that the situation is “not
sobad.” He explained thatsince
people tend to go where the
jobs are, industrial growth in

Pittsburgh ‘will help stop the ‘ '

migration trend and betterthe
regiOn’s economic woes.

Singh concluded his
presentation with an optimistic
note saying, “Given Our
tremendous resources here the
future looks good, but we have
a long way to go.”

Aleksandr Shokhin, director I

of the Academy of Economic
Science of the U.S.S.R., cited
regional sociological differences
within the Soviet Union as being
“a very important factor affecting
economic development” in that
country.

He explained that the varied
social structure in the Soviet
Union provides no rational
economic behavior with which
to base new economic reforms.
He added that there have been
many hypotheses as to what
economic road his country
should take.

“Some believe in a market
economy,” he said while
pointing out that such a course
could lead to a severe
unemployment problem.
“Others feel we should take
gradual steps on our economy
without radical changes. The
new concept is that we be radical
_and take stage-by—stage steps.”

In conclusion, Shokhin said
that society is much different in

' the Soviet Union than in the

United States and that this affects
attempts at economic reform.
“Soviets know better their

problems. We cannot implant,

your [U.S.] methods in our

1 country,” he said.

People’s Deputy of the U.S.S.R.
and Chief of the Department of
Economic Mechanism of
Managing the Socialist Economy
Pavel G. Bunich said that there

are presently many ecOnomi,gg:g..
reforms being discussed and-'--*""""":

implemented in the U.S.S.R. 1

“But we can’t develop these
in five minutes,” he said.

Some of these reforms include
the radical re-evaluation of the
banking system, a new system
of insurance and_ setting up a‘
stock exchange. V

Soviet defends ethnic secession

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Ethnic groups wanting to
secede from the Soviet Union
should have the right to do so,
according to a Soviet official.

“What I would like to see is
the freedom of decision to

decide one’s nationality,” said _

Yuri Zamoshkin of the USA.
Studies Institute. “Maybe it
would be painful for the union,
and I would hate to see them
secede, but these ethnic groups
must be recognized. They have
made a big contribution to our
nation, but freedom of choice is
still freedom of choice.”

In recent years, the Soviet
Union has experienced serious
problems with its many different
cultural and ethnic groups
showing discontent with the
Soviet government, sometimes
leading to military violence.

“Sometimes the nationalists
reject the views of individuals,”
Zamoshkin said Friday morning
in a Chautauqua at Pitt
workshop at the Syria Mosque
Auditorium.

Zamoshkin said that
Americans do not fully
understand his country’s

problem, since different ethnic
and cultural groups in the
United States have historically
blended togetherunder a desire
to be known as “Americans.”
However, in the Soviet Union,
Zamoshkin said, most people
identify to their separate ethnic
origins instead of as “Soviets.”
Also, the fact that 130 different
languages are used in the Soviet
Union drastically widens the
gap between cultures, he said.

Anatoly Sazonov of the
Central Committee’s State and
Law Department said that Soviet
Premier Mikhail Gorbachev has
been working on new

approaches to ease the
country’s cultural tensions.

“There has been a growing
awareness of ethnic problems
in the Soviet Union. We are
trying to study other countries’
solutions to these problems,”
Sazonov said, adding that the
press has recently given much
attention to the situation.

“What is necessary is the
supremacy of the central
government over the separate
republics. The policy of the
national ‘government is to
ensure national peace,”
Sazonov said.

“We have a very complex 1
situation, but I believe we can.
fulﬁll the aims of perestroika —

to solve this without violence,”
said Zamoshkin.

Laurence Glasco, associate
professor of history at Pitt, said
that the role of ethnicity in the
United States has been much
different than in the U.S.S.R.

President Bush recently gave Vice President Dan Quayle
a needed ego—booster when he announced his intention
to once again name Quayle as his running mate in the

1992 elections.

Bush’s reasoning appears quite sound. According to the
‘ Dallas Morning News, Bush feels that Quayle has been
“an outstanding vice president, doing exactly what I want

I 0‘ him to do and doing it because his heart is in it.”

Considering the fact that the duties of a vice president
are ‘not exactly challenging, as demonstrated quite well
by Bush’s eight years in the position, just what is Quayle
doing that he is doing so well? The American people --do

A 7. not doubt Quayle’s qualifications as vice president di-
rectly, they are more concerned with the possibility that

he could someday become president.

Thus, it seems that Bush’s confidence in Quayle’s

. success at his current post may be irrelevant. To repeat
what some consider to have been a big mistake on Bush’s

' part by nominating Quayle in the first place may prove

I to be a deciding factor in the next election.

Expensive pro testo rs

Not only do they tar clinicsand harass young women
’ who have made one of the most difficult decisions of their

lives, but they cost the county $6,000 a day.

‘Eighty-five abortion protestors who were arrested after
an ‘anti-abortion rally one week ago Saturdaylare being
housed at the former McIntyre Shelter in'Ross Township.

, ' They have opted to remain in custody rather that post the
‘ $300 bail required for their release. In addition, more than
150 family_members and friends demonstrated outsideof

’ the shelter by singing and giving speeches. They wanted
to “show support” butwere not permitted to visit those

being held in the shelter. ‘

Aside from the $6,000 per day costs to thetaxpayers,
there were also costs incurred by the sheriffs department
and county police _during the actual transport of the

protestors to the shelter.

thou-gh hearings have begun and many have been
released on their own recognizance, there are ‘always
more anti-abortion rallies to supply a constant source of
protestors, who, in the end, are never really prosecuted,
anyway. Why don’t they do taxpayers, clinic personnel,
and most importantly, the young women who are enter-

ing the clinics "a favor and end the costly protests?

A ‘New Mentality’ in America

rmonthly load of laundry last

”Andyay there I walleed through
the valley of dirty, stinkin ‘clothes,
and I was not afraid— of course,
I had a great big bottle of liquid
Cheer to come to my aid!"
Laundry Guy Gets Funky (un-

. published) a

—— Michael Moore

Ah, nothing like a bit of gonzo
sociological sap to spice up life.
If you agree with this statement
— and promise to click your
heels together three times — read
on, ‘cause I got a column for you!
Today, gentle reader, the subject
is America’s latest crazed obses-
sion: liquid laundry detergent.

I know what you’re thinking:
“What the hell are you talking

about? My liquid Woolite has‘.

been around as long as my knit
creations!’j. ’

_ Just quit, dam—it! Only recently
have Americans been able to go
to the local Piggly Wiggly and

choose from so many bottles of ..

liquid Fab, liquid Tide, liquid All,
liquid Cheer and ‘liquid Arm 8:
Hammer (the last “real” deter-
gent). , '

If you are wondering why I am
not writing about a “Serious Is-
sue" (as if America’s salvation
from dirt and body odor is a
minor deal) — don’t worry. It's
time to get serious here, and boy-
oh—boy have I got a bone to pick
with society this time.

Personally, I refuse to purchase
these new liquids—of-the-future.
It's still loads of laundry fun to
stick your hand- into a year-old
box of powder detergent and
break up the hardened ball that
moisture has left to play with. Oh
sure, you can shake these new

I jugs of detergent and marvel at

how they produce a sound ex-
actly like Rex Reed’s stomach -——.
but hey, its just not the same.

It's this writer's opinion that »

liquid laundry detergent is so
damn popular these days ‘be-
cause it reminds us of something
that we could eat. It's absolutely

true. When I was doing my .bi—

weekend, I noticed that my liq-
uid Cheer had, say, a bit of an
aroma. A wonderful tutti-frutti
smell, mightl add. In fact, I even
took a little swig — and guess
what? It tastes even better than
‘thatyummy green punch we all
love so much in the cafeteria! The
idea that we love household
products that remind us of food
reeks, of major, importance.
Today, Americans are demand-
ing household products that they

I

feel they could eat. Call it neuro— '

sis. Call it a need for security. Call
it my crazy idea.- But think about
it —— we can control what we eat.
Therefore, we feel a_ whole lot

look at a product squarely and

Hence, we have a marketplace
that is bursting like a Madison
Avenue acne cyst —— a market-
place of products that look or
smell like food. Dutch Boy scrub-
bing pads look like tempting tarts.
Jobes plant fertilizer sticks look
like candy cigarettes. Shaving
cream looks like Twinkle ﬁlling.
Toothpaste looks like aqua-green

product that makes doing laun-
dry more appealing by rernind—
ing us of eating —— instead of the
otherwise unpleasant task at
hand. It may work, but at what
price?

To answer that question, one

could simply state, “Anywhere
from a $1.97 to $9.14." On a

'slightly more intellectual level,

however, (careful — watch your
step!) the price we pay is quite
revealing. We have reached -’a~
point where everything must now
appeal to our hunger —— both
primal and avariciousi The latter

I of the two is particularly disturb-

ing. .
By aestheticizing * poisonous
products — like roach pellets
and Cheez Whiz — we have
essentially declared a need to
change the world into the “New
Mentality.” We have tried to
improve products so that they
disguise their real purposes.

’ Before, you could tell the differ-

Cheez Whiz. Roach pellets look ‘

like chocolate crackers. Windex
looks like lime-aid. Caulking
material looks like peanut butter.
And, of course, liquid laundry
detergent looks and smells like
gelatinous punch. _- I
Yesterday’s laundry detergents
were messy, uninviting. Today’s
new detergents are the newest
entry into the “Its Better ‘Cause!
Really Could Eat It If I Wanted
To” category of marketing and
promotion. Marketing aces in
New York have come up with a

ence between the pantry and the
medicine cabinet. Now, products
have assumed a non-identity.
Indeed, as perverse synthesia has
strangled the American consumer
in a choke hold. We feel in con-
trol now, and the CEOs‘are smirk-
ing all the way to the bank.

Go tell the boys on Madison
Avenue — that cynosure of the
formative American identity --
that the game of charades is over.
We are ready now to return to an
acceptance of products that re-
vealtheir true identity. No, we
aren’t going to fall apart at the
seams and have to pop three
Advils if our laundry detergent
doesn't remind us of Kool-Aid.

Go tell this whole “New Men-
tality” thing to give us a break.
Stop buying products of clever

deception. Go ahead, America — '

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, November 6, 1989

Vote Carlo Stubby’ Garguzzo for SGB President

It's SGB election time again
folks and we know what that
means. On election day, we will
be mobbed by candidate sup-
porters begging for our votes.
Candidate X promises to change
Pitt Stadium’s umbrella policy,
Candidate Y promises to abolish
The Pitt News and Candidate Z
promises to abolish my columns.
(He’s the one with the three-
point lead.) So, who are you
going to vote for?

As a columnist for The Pitt
News, I feel compelled to risk
my prestige and openly support
a candidate. Unfortunately, this
person failed to apply on time
so he will have to be a write—in
candidate, not on the ballot. My
choice is Carlo “Stubby” Gar-
guzzo. I managed to obtain an

exclusive interview with the said a

candidate.

Mario: Stubby, why do you

want to be the president of the
Student Government Board? I
Stubby: I’ll tell ya Mario, I'm
likeda junior now and-I don't

four is, every year, wasting more
than $350. According to Citizens

ing imports of clothing, forcing

sive U.S.- made clothing.

' Many people think that im-
ports are “bad.” Most want more
import quotas and tariffs. Present
restrictions merely raise prices.
More restrictions could only in-
crease the harm. ‘

 What exactly deﬁnes something

as being an import? Well, I do not
grow my own food. Instead, I
import it from the supermarket.
Of course, I could grow it myself,
but this would be quite.ineff1—

Likewise, if I buy furniture that
was made in Wyoming, that could
be considered an import. Who

The history books,don'talWays tell the full story

We have a problem with the
rebuttal by John Gall concern-
ing an article printed on Oct. 16
(“Don’t Believe the Hype”).John,
WAKE UP! Your rebuttal repre-
sents a common misconception
about the “beloved” founding
fathers of our country. Learn the
facts. Lincoln did not free, the
slaves because he was con-
cerned about them.[...] The true

_ reasons that Lincoln freed the

 slaves were 1.) to break the

economy of the South 2.) to
make it possible for black per-
sons to enlist in- the Union army
when they were needed as
manpower on the verge of the
defeat of the North.

In respect to the economy,

 the reasoning was that if you

stopped the South’s free- labor

' system, there was no way of

promoting the industry. In re-
spect to enlisting, blacks in both

have one damn thing to put on
my resume. I figured that if I won
the SGB presidencyl could pad
the old resume, yet not do a damn
thing in the meantime.

Mario: I see, Stubby. Well, I’m
sure there must be some respon-
sibility to go along with the job.
What about the Student Reserve
Fund? What would you do with
all that money?

Stubby: I'm glad you asked
that, paisan. There’s this cute
little park bench in Market Square
Garden that would look just lovely
in front of the William Pitt Union.
It’s made out of South African
wood, which is really" valuable,
and‘it’s a steal for only $8,000. If
we want the wino, it’s $10,000.”

Mario: Yes, we could always
use another bench. Now let me
ask you this, Stubby. You are
running for the most powerful
position that a student can have.
You must have a lot of leadership
experience, right?

Stubby: Yeah, right.

Mario: Excuse me?

Stubby: C’mon Mario, lighten
up, this is Pitt! OK... OK... I’ll

does this import help?I obviously
benefit because I get the furniture
that I want. The Wyoming furni-
ture company beneﬁts because
the company makes money and
the workers get jobs. The sale of
the furniture does not bring harm
to anyone.’ —' "  ' ﬂ 
For the same reasons, purchas-
ing things from other countries is
beneficial. Quite a few Ameri-
cans do not seem to be able to
grasp this concept For example,
a lot of people want the United
States to increase the quotas on
imported steel. They argue that
this would create jobs in the U.S.
steel industry. Certainly this is
true. However, the resulting in-
crease in the price of steel would
destroy jobs in the industries that
use the steel. Furthermore, retail
prices of items made from steel
would go up. Since consumers
would be spending more money
on these, less money would be

the North and the South were
not allowed to join the Union

army until Jan. 1, 1863. Before -

then, slaves who managed to
escape and make it to ‘Union
army camps were often beaten

by the troops and then returned 1

to their owners. Likewise, the
free blacks in the North that
wanted to join were summarily
turned away, " often with vio-
lence. It was not until the North's
loss at the Battle of Antietam on
Sept. 17, 1862, that Lincoln

, considered activating ‘ black

troops. The North was on the
verge of losing the whole war
andvery much in need of man-
power. It hurt them very much
to do so, but they enacted a law
on July 17, 1862, that would
allow black soldiers to join, fr-
Most history books do not
point out these facts. Lincoln

 

answer your question. Experi-
ence... I was on the Student
Government Board, I saw the
movie Platoon twice and I play
the Cello. .

Mario: Uh-huh. But other than

that you have zero experience? 

Stubby: Even less than that.

 

Mario: OK Stubby, perhaps you
can tell me who your backers
are. Which groups, fraternities,
etc. are pulling for you?

Stubby: That’s an easy one]

I’ve got the unofficial support of
the Pitt Program Council.

Mario: Say, you’re the candi-
date that wants to abolish The
Pitt News.

Stubby: Sshh!

Mario: Now let me ask you a

personal question. Because of V

your ethnic last name, a lot of

spent on other things, thus fur-
thering the destruction of jobs
and reducing our standard of
living. " ‘ '

Of course, when the United
States limits foreign imports, it
hurts the countries doing the

 

exporting. Bangladesh, a pov-
erty-striken Third World nation,
had a promising clothing indus-_
try during the late 1970s and
early 1980s. Unfortunately, the
US. government has since put
up strong barriers that restrict
imports of clothing from that

nation. This is drastically reduc-

ing the opportunity foreconornic

had not even thought of eman-
cipation when he entered of- '
fice. He said in his inaugural
address in March, 1861: “I have
no purpose, directly. or indi-
rectly to interfere with the insti-
tution of slavery in the states

 

where it exists. I believe I have
no lawful right to do so, and I
have no inclination to do so."

-To put the proverbial “icing on

the cake,” three days later, he
drew up an amendment to the
Constitution which read, “I
propose this amendment to the
Constitution which will forever
deny Congress the right to
abolish slavery in the United
States.” " ’

Racist remarks and actions by

 

rumors have been ﬂoating around
about a mob connection. Is there
any truth to that?

Stubby: Who told you that?

Mario: 1... I...

Stubby: I'll break their god-
damn legs. Hey, Tito! (He waves
to the behemoth in the corner.)
Follow this gavone when he
leaves. Now, (straightening his
tie) back to the interview.

Mario:_Yeah. Well, let me ask
you this — the president of the
United States usually tries to
accomplish much in his first 100
days, unless he’s a Republican. If
you win, what do you wishto
achievein your first 100 days?

Stubby: Good question. First _

I’d like to get some new furniture
up in the SGB office —— it’s start-
ing to look like South Oakland
up there. Then I’d like to help
fight Oakland crime, create a
better student atmosphere and

feed all of the starving people in

Homestead —— in that order.
Mario: What are you, a Miss
America contestant? There must
be something else you intend to
do. "Something really important!

advancement in Bangladesh. In
1987, Congress gave Bangladesh
$84.2 million in economic aid. If
our Congressmen truly wanted
to help the residents of Bangla-
desh, they would lift our nation’s

-trade barriers. That way, the‘
people of Bangladesh would

become more self-sufficient in-
stead of a U.S. welfare depend-
ent. And clothing for us would
become more affordable. I
The conceptof “free trade" is
based, not surprisingly, on indi-

. vidual freedom. If I want to buy

something that was made in
another country, I should be free
to do so. Present government
quotas set limits on this. For

example, there is a legal limit on-

how much foreign sugar we can
import. After that, any imported
sugar is illegal. Murder, rape and
robbery are illegal and punish-
able, butwhat should be done to
someone who buys more foreign

the founding fathers of our “free

society” are often deleted from '

public record. In Lincoln's case,
it is quite obvious why the

- “establishment” in this country

would go through great pains to
do so. , -

Also to the point of slavery in
Egypt, their system was based
on the idea of contracts of servi-

‘ tude. Many times this involved a

debt which would be paid off
by the servitude of the person
who owed the “debt to the per-'
son to who the debt is owed.
There was also their concept of

_serfage, a mild form of obliga-
tion, which kept the country

from succumbing to the ravages
and ruins of the European- '
Americans’ idea of slavery.[. ..‘] It
was considered slavery in that

Drug problem sbczreoz’ by supeipowers

‘H By Katie Malaspina

For The Pitt News

Experts from the United States
and the Soviet Union came
together Thursday at a
Chautauqua workshop to
discuss drug and alcohol abuse
in their countries.

Charles R. Schuster, director
of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, cited several national
surveys to explain the change
in attitudes and use of drugs
among Americans. Availability
of illicit drugs has remained
relatively the same since 1975,
according to the National
Institute on Drug Abuse high

_ school survey. it

“But attitudes about the
harmfulness of drugs has
changed. High school seniors

realize that it is perceived as
harmful," said Schuster.

Janis K. Strazdinsh, chief
narcologist at the Latvian
Republican Outpatient Clinic,
concentrated mainly on the
problems of alcohol abuse in
Latvia, USSR. Strazdinsh noted
a continued increase in alcohol
production in the past 20 years
in Latvia. '

He said that in 1985, . “a
campaign was launched to
combat alcoholism in Latvia as
well as the rest of the U.S.S.R.
”This campaign included
increasing the price of alcohol,
limiting the production and sales
of alcohol and devising more
medical programs to assist
alcoholics. Strazdinsh said that
since these regulations have
been imposed, alcohol-related

deaths have decreased. In 1988
the government of Latvia allowed
increases in the sale of alcohol.

“We've also addressed the
church for assistance, and they
have responded. Joint programs
with the church have been
initiated,” said Strazdinsh. He
also thanked the Central Board of
Alcoholics Anonymous for their
assistance in helping set up
programs in Latvia. I

“None of us can_ cure an‘
alcoholic completely. We can only
keep him sober," he said.

Valery S. Bitensky, assistant
professor at Odessa Medical
Institute, said, “The adolescent
drug addiction is a concern to the
Soviet and the U.S. public alike.
The image of mankind in the 21st
century is largely dependent on
this problem.”

Generals call arms
reductions possible

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Two of the top military officers
from the East and West talked
about progress at the bargaining
table in Geneva during “Current
Perspectives on Nuclear and
Conventional Arms Control" on
Thursday.

Both Major General Anatolii
Bolyatko, legal treaty
administrator for the general staff
of the armed forces of the Soviet
Union, and Brigadier General
Nels Running, deputy director

I for international negotiations for

the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave
positive statements about the
progress in Geneva.

Bolyatko spoke on the actual

 

reductions that the U.S.S.R. has
made in their arsenal. “We have
withdrawn over 50,000 troops
from Eastern Europe, and we
have demobilized three full tank
divisions," he said.

He also mentioned reductions
in the Soviet defense budget.
“Over the past two years, our
defense budget has gone down
by 14 percent,” he said. Bolyatko
then disputed a claim from the
audience that the Soviets spend
about 20 percent of their entire
budget on defense.

He praised the efforts of both '

countries to get a strategic
weapons treaty signed. “We
have made considerable
headway in Geneva to cut
strategic offensive weapons by
50 percent,” Bolyatko said.
But Bolyatko criticized the
United States for stalling at the
bargaining table. “We are ready
to sign a weapons treaty,” he
said, .“but we cannot agree on
fundamental definitions of
many things.” » -
General Running defended
our country’s position in Geneva
and why U.S. negotiators didn’t

agree to some of the Soviet‘

demands. He used our navy as
an example. Running said that
the United States will not accept
cuts in the navy because of our
obligations worldwide, as
opposed to usage around
Europe only.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

First look at hoopsters will be sans Miller

By Rob Codispot
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther basketball
team, coming off a roller coaster
1988-89 season that saw it defeat
Top 20 teams like Oklahoma,
Georgetown and Syracuse and
lose to such teams as Siena,
Duquesne and Ball State, tip-off
the 1989-90 campaign tonight at
Fitzgerald Field'House with an
exhibition against Athletes .In
Action.

The 1989-90 season not only
brings high accolades, but also
the toughest schedule in school
history. This year’s slate, rated by
some as the toughest in the nation,
includes Georgia Tech (possibly
twice), Oklahoma State (twice),

Arizona and probably North.

Carolina State as well as
conference foes Georgetown,
Syracuse, Villanova and St. John’s.

Pitt head coach Paul Evans
returns his starting five, including
pre—seasonAll-Americacandidate
Brian Shorter, and his top two

V subs from last year’s 17-13 squad.

Given that fact, the Panthers have
received some pre—season Top
20 consideration by both The

’ Sporting News (10th) and Dick



QT’):

Vitale’s Basketball (20th).

One reason other pre—season
polls may have bypassed Pitt in
their rankings is its lack of depth.
Evans recruited a stellar freshman
class, only to see them all deemed
academically ineligible by the
NCAA’s Proposition 48. That
leaves Rod Brookin, possibly the
nation's best sixth—man, as Evans’
only legitimate threat, off the
bench.

Since tonight’s game is of
the exhibition variety, many
would think Panther coaches

'Cavanaugh both

would be utilizing it to get some
much—needed playing time for
Pitt’s reserves. However,
according to assistant coach Norm
Law, the Panthers’ big guns will
see the majority of the action.

“Player~wise, we will probably
stick with the seven or eight that
are going to have to carry the
load [this seasonl,” Law said.
[Tonight] is more of an experience
for us to find outwhere we are at
this point in the season. We want
to try a lot of different things, see
what we need to work on and
what we need to polish up before
we get into Big East play.”

One of the players expected
to carry some of that load this
season will not see any playing
time tonight. Sean Miller, the
Panthers’ junior ﬂoor leader,
remains sidelined with a stress

, fracture in his foot and may not

be available for the clash with the
Soviets later this month.

“Sean is day-to-day, probably
more week—to—week," Law said.
“We really can’t tell [when Miller
will return].

“A stress fracture is a funny
thing. If he comes back on it too
soon, he may be out for the
season. We want to make sure
the doctors feel comfortable that

it is healed. Then, we will give ‘

him a shot.”

The point-guard position will.)

be in capable hands during
Mi1ler’s absence, with junior
Darelle Porter and senior Pat
receiving
opportunities to run the team.
Porter’s quickness, creativity and
defensive ability may give him an
early edge over Cavanaugh, but

Volleyball team completes
successful home schedule
with quartet of Victories

By Ron Ledgard and Scott Campbell

The women’s volleyball team completed their home schedule
this weekend, going 4—0 in matches against Penn, St. Bonaventure
(twice) and‘ Hofstra at the Fitzgerald Field House. The Lady
rpved their record 24-6.

The toughest match for the Lady Panthers was the last one,
Sunday night againstthe Hofstra Flying Dutchwomen. This was
the first home match of the season for the§I.ady Panthers that
went the maximum five games, (15-5, 5-15, 15-7, 6-15, 15-11).

The match was the last home match for seniors Julie Sheils,

Before the match Pitt head coach Sue Woodstra said, “We are
looking for a very tough match from Hofstra. They defeated
Oklahoma earlier this year and they [Oklahoma] are a fine

The first game opened with both teams searching for an
advantage. The score was knotted at four before Pitt broke it
open. Serving from Shelly Seanor and Lori Silk proved to be the
difference. Seanor gave Pitt a 9~4 advantage by taking Hofstra’s
setter Ines Portuondo out of their offense with hard-to- handle
serves. Silk served out the last five points for the Panther victory.

Julie Shells introduced Hofstra’s Cathy Cole to a Pitt six-pack.

Fla., are also up for grabs.
Redmon, a sophomore, grew

players that he played with and
against while in high school,

adding even more incentive to "

win. .

.“When I go home, the other
guys are always talking about
Miami, Miami, Miami. If I happen
to lose this game, I’m gonna hear
about it,” said Redmon. “I'm
gonna get ripped from the time I
step off the plane until the time I
come back again.” .

However, Redmon admits that
he grew up rooting for the

“I think [for] everybody that
was my age, Miamiwas the team
that you rooted for. They were
the hot thing in town, the
Dolphins weren’t doing so well,
but the Hurricanes were,”
Redmon said. “Everybody wanted
to be like the Hurricanes;
everybody wanted the Hurricanes
to win." -

Among the Miami" players that
Redmon still considers good
friends are cornerback Roland
Smith, wide receiver Randal Hill
and running back Alex Johnson.

“Even though we go to different
schools, we made a vow_to' each
other that we would remain
friends, no matter what happened,
and we try to talk [to each other]
at least three times a month.
We’re all like brothers; we all

Fullback Jeff Christy blew out his
knee, however, and the Panther
coaches asked Redmon if he
would move to fullback to fill the
void.

“They had so much depth at
the tailback position, and there
were really not enough fullbacks

so they asked me to make the
change. I said ‘I don’t mind.’ It’s
to help the team, and it’s a chance
to get on the ﬁeld a lot more

Redmon was used sparingly
with the ball last year, however,
carrying the ball only 30 times for

; 96 yards and three touchdowns,

and catching three passes for 39
yards.
This year Redmon has already

, surpassed those ﬁgures. He is

third on the team in rushing (43
times for 148 yards) and second

as a receiver may be rare for a

Area wrestling fans will
receive their own special
Christmas present on Dec. 26,
when the first “World Wrestling
Grand Championship" is held at
the Pittsburgh Civic Arena.

The event, whose main

.-~.. sponsor is Blue Cross, features

the top U.S. wrestlers against the
premier grapplers from around
the world. As an added twist to
the event, prize money will be
awarded — an unheard- of
concept up to this point in
wrestling.

There will be 11 matches held,
with the main event at 136.5

,f"\, pounds, where 1988 Olympic

gold medalist John Smith from
the United States will take on
two—time Olympic and six-time
world champion Sergei
Beloglazov from the Soviet Union.

Two other feature matches
are scheduled. At 149.5 pounds,
Nate Carr (U.S.A.) will oppose
Arsen Fadzaev (U.S.S.R.).
American Bruce Baumgartner will

Soviet opponents, while an
intriguing rnatchup occurs at 180.5
pounds, where a rematch of the
1989 World Championship final
will be held. In that encounter,
American Melvin Douglas will
oppose Soviet rival Elmadie
Jabraylov, who was victorious in
the September contest.

Lee Roy Smith, the USA’s
Freestyle National coach, will take
command of Team USA for the
evening, and he sees this
December night as a major turning
point for American wrestling.

“It’s important from a
psychological standpoint,” Smith
said at a press conference at the
Civic Arena’s Igloo Club on
Thursday. “We need this as we
progress to our goal of winning
the 1992 Olympics.”

For the first time in history,
more than pride will be on the

-line for the matches. A total of

$65,000 will be distributed for the
evening. In the main event alone,
$10,000 will be dueled’ for
between Smith and Beloglazov,
as the winner will get $8,000 and
the loser‘$2,000. The
rest of the bouts have a $5,000
purse, as the winner will take
home $4,000 and the loser $ 1,000.

Modern eligibility rules will '

still allow the wrestlers to retain
rights to compete in international
and Olympic competition in_the
future. The prize money will be
distributed to the wrestlers

be given to the athletes -— a

Jeff Blatnik, who was given
much publicity for overcoming
leukemia to win a 1984 Olympic
gold medal, feels that the

slackening of eligibility rules can
only help the sport ‘

“When I was training, we
only had about $4,000 a year to
work with,” Blatnik said. “I was
sleeping on couches anywhere I
could get a place to stay."

The reason that a wrestling
card of such magnitude is coming
to Pittsburgh is simple, according

to Blatnik.

“Pennsylvania is a hotbed ‘of
wrestling,” he said. “When you
think of collegiate wrestling, you
always think of Oklahoma and
Iowa, but if you took all of the
best wrestlers from each state,
Pennsylvania would win a
tournament.”

Seeriﬂe spikes were whistling by
her opponent’s ears throughout
the match, but Sheils said that she
was not even playing at full

strength, perhaps a good thing-

for Cole.

“I’m recovering from tendonitis
of the bicep and was really
looking for my game. I- couldn’t
even swing. I lost my approach,
my hit and everything,” Sheils
said.

The Dutchwomen grabbed
hold of the second game in a
hurry, jumping out to leads of 4-
1 and 10-2 before the Lady
Panthers could make anything of
the game. Hofstra’s outside hitter
Valerie Witulski picked apart the
Pitt frontline with ﬁve kills in the
game match. A kill is a downward
shot that lands for a point.

Thunderous kills by Dee

0 MacAuley sent an early message

to Hofstra that this was Pitt’s
game. Pitt only trailed once before
putting this game away, due in
large part to the serving of an
inspired Silk. Midway through
this game the Lady Panthers
looked lifeless, but the Pitt
gymnastics team arrived at the
Field House, cheering and doing
the wave, which spurred the Lady
Panthers to victory.

Momentum swung back to
Hofstra in the fourth game behind
a lot of mental errors from the
Lady Panthers.

“All the way through we were
making so many mistakes -
hitting mistakes, service errors,
dumb things.” Woodstra said.

According to Woodstra, Matheis
was getting frustrated with the
Hofstra defense. “She was trying
too hard. That’s not uncommon
for Kelly.”

The fifth game followed the
same pattern as the second and
the fourth with Hofstra taking a
9-4 lead. The Lady Panthers turned
the tide, thanks to Sheils, who
had 11 kills in the final game, and
Silk, who served for the ﬁnal
three points. The three seniors
put their marks on the final point
with Silk serving, Matheis setting
and Sheils delivering the fatal kill
in Pitt’s come back.

“I think that we just finally
decided that we're not losing our
final home match,” Silk said.

St. Bonaventure entered the
weekend with an 8-16 record
and had to play the Lady Panthers
on Saturday and Sunday. After
Saturday’s match they probably
wished that they could have
sneaked back to New York that
night without a peep. Pitt
dominated the (mis)match, using
only six players in winning 15-4,

15~2, 15-1. The Bonnies could do

nothing to stop Dee MacAuley,
who at 6 feet tall, towered above
the tallest Bonnie, Rachel
Hourigan, 5-8.

Pitt had, a little more difficulty

with the Bonnies on Sunday,
however, at least in the first game,
cruising to a 16-14, 15-1, 15-8
win.

Pitt stumbled to an 8—3 lead in
the first game as the Bonnies
committed several unforced
errors. However, the Lady
Panthers were unable to take full
advantage at times."

St. Bonaventure put together a
little streak, pushing to a 14-13
lead. Pitt then inserted Michele
Adamson who served for three

straight points and snatched the

game from the Bonnies. ,

Pitt shot out to a 13-0 lead in
the second game before losing
their shutout bid to the Bonnies.

The third game grew
monotonous with neither team
able to gain a head of steam. The
Lady Panthers won ‘basically
because they committed less
errors than the Bonnies.

“We played a little better
yesterday. Today there was no
concentration," said Woodstra.
Upon hearing that, one of the
official scorers observed, “It was
just a lazy Sunday afternoon.”

“Yeah, it was,” Woodstra
agreed.

Also on Saturday, the Lady

Panthers defeated Penn, 1-5-6, 16-‘

14, 13-15, 15-6, in a lackluster

the bench the past two years.

‘We'll probably split the time
between them," Law said. “At this
particular time, it is up in the air
so much that I would not
speculate on who will start or
who will play more. I think we
just have to play it by ear and see

’ who plays best."

Amid all the familiar faces in
the Pitt lineup will be two new

ones -- center Darren
MorningstarandswingmanTravis
Ziegler.

Morningstar, who sat out last
season after transfering from
Navy, is Pitt's most prized
newcomer. His 6—foot-10-inch,
250—pound frame will give the
Panther frontline the added size
and bulk to compete with the
likes of Georgetown, Syracuse
and St. John's in the Big East.

Morningstar said he will be
using his first game as a Panther
to start ironing out the wrinkles
in his game.

“Any parts of my game that
might be a little rusty, I hope I can

improve on before the season A

:’§',smrts," he said. “Rebounding,

'3



ﬁlling the lane [on the break] and

makinggood passes out to the
guards for three-point shots are
all things I need to work on.”

Many have already projected
Morningstar as Pitt's . starting
center, enabling Bobby Martin to
move to his more natural power-
forward position and Brian
Shorter to small forward. Whether
starting or coming off the bench,
Morningstar figures to get his
minutes.

“I don't think [Evans] is going
with a particular group right now,"

9 he said. “He is going to try different

lineups to see who works well
together. It will be a learning
experience for everyone."
Ziegler, a 6—foot6—inch
freshman, is still learning the Pitt
system and getting accustomed
to the level of competition the
Big East has to offer, according to
Law. Evans has been shufﬂing

i_ him back and forth between

shooting guard and small forward,
bringing him along slowly.

“I really don't know what
coach has in mind," Ziegler said.
“I've been working at the two-
spot and the thrce—spot."

Added Law: “I would say that
all will probably see time. But, it

will probably take a while before
Travis gets into the normal
substitution rotation.”

Defense is one area the
Panthers need to improve.
Panther opponents shot 48
percent from the field last season
and averaged 79.3 points per
game.

Law said Pitt will mix up their
man and zone defenses, hoping
to begin improvement on those
numbers. Former UCLA star
“Rocket” Rod Foster will provide
Panther guards with a chance to
improve their man-to-man
defense immediately.

“Foster is quick," Law said,
“but he's probably not any quicker
than some of the people we're
going to play against during the
year. We might as well find out
right away who can defend and
who can't."

Officials agree to exchange environmental data

By Tammy Richardson
For The Pitt News

Oflicials from the United States
and the Soviet Union agreed to
exchange technology on
pollution and waste control
during a Chautauqua workshop

Edgar Berkey, president of the
Center for Hazardous Materials
Research, spoke of the billions of
dollars being spent to clean up
waste- dumping sites, sewers and
miles of American rivers unﬁt for
swimming because of poor waste
control. He referred to these

Berkey said the United States
would welcome a partnership
with the U.S.S.R. to exchange
technology and create a plan for
long-term waste and pollution
control.

He suggested thatthe United
States “join forces with the Soviets

as drug abuse, the environment
and women’s issues.

“The need to relate to each
other in a peaceful, rational sense
is as strong as ever,” Bratton
said, “but the human agenda and
the need for understanding is
just as important.” ‘

Tereshkova discussed the
benefits of exchanging opinions

on human issues. She said that i

the frank discussions at the
conference helped Soviets and
Americans to get to know each
other better.

“We learned to carefully listen,”
Tereshkova said, “and to ask

 
    
     
   
   
   
   
     

 

good will on both sides.

“There isan enormous potential
for good will in the American and
Soviet people,” she said. “The
conference has helped to free up
this potential. ”'

, But Tereshkova cautioned that
the conference only marks the
beginning of improved relations
between the two nations.

“We have to continue to follow
the road of Chautauqua —e— the
road of underStanding,’.’ she said.
“This will require much effort
and energy.” '

All of the speakers thanked the
hundreds of staff members and
volunteerS— from Pitt and the

the week.

The three. speakers also
exchanged gifts on behalf of
their ' organizations as
remernbrances of the conference.
Posvar presented an original print
of Pittsburgh in 188010 Bratton
and the Chautauqua Institution.

A Bratton presented Tereshkova
and the Union of Soviet
Friendship Societies with a
wooden “Century Chest,”
representing a “wish for a century
of peace and understanding.”
Each of the 100 small drawers in
the chest contains a gift-from an
American to a Soviet.

Tereshkova gave a small bell

According to Evgeny Primakov,
chairman of the Council of the
Union of the Supreme Soviet, the
USSR doesn’t necessarily want to
become “genuinely democratic.”

“We’re not the same kind of
society as the U.S.A.; we have our
own traditions, values, customs
and geographic bou ndaries," said
Primakov, who spoke after
Bradley on Friday. “We want a

As an example of poor
allocation, Bradley used the
example that 30 to 40 percent of
the fresh fruit and vegetables
produced in the Soviet Union rot
before they get to the market.

Bradley also said that it may be
not be necessary for the United
States to help the Soviets with
their economy. “The Soviet Union
