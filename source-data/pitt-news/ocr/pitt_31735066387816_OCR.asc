War protests of '90s should
resemble civil rights movement

By Eric Hoch
Sta_[f Writer

It is an insult that Jan. 15, the day
American troops may begin a war with
Iraq, is also the birthday of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., said activist Vince Eirene
at a non-violence seminar yesterday.

“This seminar is to show the connection
between the civil-rights movements of the
’60s and the war protests of the ‘90s,” said
Eirene.

“During the ’60s Martin Luther King

preached non-violent confrontation. He

Riding the tide of anti—war
sentiment that has been
appearing on college campuses
across the nation, concerned area
citizens met last night in the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Cathedral of Learning to unite
and organize ways to spread their
message, “Stop the war before it
starts.”

About 50 members of the
fledgling Pittsburgh Students
Against the War helped to
propose a massive public-
awareness media blitz targeted
at letting the Bush administration
know that the group feels the
United States should not go to
war with Iraq on Jan. 15, the day
that the United Nations deemed
the last chance for Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to withdraw his
troops from the oil—rich country
of Kuwait.

The effort involves two parts,
which are being handled by two

informal internal committees. The
task of the first is to take definite
action to increase awareness of
the severity of the Persian Gulf
crisis and to encourage public
condemnation of U.S. in-
volvement. The second com-
mittee is a field—service team to
Contact group leaders of
organizations on the Pitt campus
as well as leaders of groups from
other areas so that they may take
similar actions. The result is
expected to be a citywide
demonstration of disgust with
the Bush administration’s policy
in the Middle East.

“Public opinion says the troops
shouldn’t be there,” insisted jill
Castek, a junior at Pitt.

Beginning today, a letter-
writing campaign will be
launched, encouraging students
to sign pre-written declarations
of disapproval which will be
sent to Congress. According to
John Day, 22, who is heading the
letter—writing committee, a stamp
drive is being arranged to help

defray the mailing costs. Mike
Laus, another Pitt student, said
that other letters may be sent
directly to the U.S. troops in the
Persian Gulf to show support for
the soldiers.

Information pamphlets are
being sent to organizations to ask
them to educate their members
and to elicit support from them,
according to Liz Berlin of PSAW.
By networking collegiate groups,
PSAW hopes to spread its ideas
more quickly.

Kathleen Iducovich, who has
been instrumental in gaining the
assistance of Concerned Leaders
for Environmental Action Now,
said, “I don’t think any student-
group coordinators should speak
for its individual members.”
Iducovich suggested that the
group leaders should present
PSAW’s ideas and let each
individual member decide on his
or her choice of action.

In addition, Sean Maclntyre,
who is not currently attending

wanted racial equality to be gained through
peace and not through violence. People
must seek non-violent ways of dealing
with the war today in the ‘90s,” said
Eirene.

The seminar, put together by Eirene,
expressed this idea through a videotape
“Ain’t Afraid Of Your Jails,” as well as
Eirene’s personal reflections and a
discussion, led by Dennis Brutus, about
what students could do to prevent war.

Coping on Campus...

'I’H:E Prrl‘ NEWS, Tuesday, January 8, 1991

Some New Year's resolutions doomed from start

sub-goals that are clearly
achievable is an effective strategy.

A resolution may also fail
because a basic skill needed for

You are probably already
beginning to slip a little on your
New Year's resolutions. A month
from now they will probably be
forgotten. Since this pattern
repeats itself over and over again
for most of us, why do we bother
to make resolutions? One answer
is that we are not happy with
some aspects of our lives, and
though our follow-through is
often weak, our plans to change
begin with good intentions and
much optimism.

There are many good reasons
why we don't or can't keep our
resolutions. Among the most
common are choosing goals that
stir up underlying fears that
impede our progress, choosing
goals that are too general in nature
and choosing goals» that go
beyond our present ability to
achieve. Sometimes all three of
these difficulties may be
encountered within one
resolution.

Take, for instance, the

seemingly straightforward
resolution of determining to be a
better student next term. This
worthy resolve may be doomed
to failure if not examined more
closely. Some students, for
example, are terrified of
discovering that there are limits
to their abilities. Consequently
they never go all out for fear that
they may not do well and be

forced to face their limitations. -

It’s better to blame it on some
other factor, such as a
procrastination problem. The
solution to this problem is
somewhat elusive and may
require some counseling as-
sistance to adequately address it.

The plan to become a better
student is also too general. The
chance of success is greatly
enhanced by addressing the
specific things good students do:
attend classes regularly, ask
questions, take good notes,
establish a regular study schedule,
etc. Breaking a general goal into

 

Dr. Robert
Gallagher

success is lacking. In this instance
the resolution to be a better
student must begin with a realistic
assessment of skills, followed

perhaps by a visit to the Learning
Skills and Development Center
or to the Writing Workshop for
specialized assistance.

Whatever goals you establish
-— whether they are to become
more social, to lose weight, to
become more assertive or to
overcome some basic fear —
take time to think about the core
issues that interfered with your
achievement of these goals in the
past. Then establish some
concrete, achievable goals, work
on the skills needed to achieve
them, and don’t be afraid to ask
for help.

An even more efficient way of
making progress toward your
personal goals is to take a little
time each morning to make some
daily resolutions. Just for that
day, resolve to speak up for
yourself, to eat healthier, to hug
someone, to exercise a little, to
take a risk, to enjoy yourself, to
face something you fear with

“Sex for Grades” is what most
people think of when they hear
of sexual harassment, but Elaine

.Frampton, assistant director of

the Affirmative Action Office, said
most of the cases the office deals
with are not so obvious.

The office mostly deals with
the gray areas of sexual ha-
rassment because those are the

“cases more commonly reported,

according to Frampton. These
include sexual remarks made by
a professor to a student, a
professor sitting too close to a
student or a professor who has

students come for office hours
for no reason and makes ad-
vances toward them.

Since last fall, eight instances
of sexual harassment have been
reported at Pitt, said Frampton.
However, not all of these were
serious.

“There are different types of
instances [of sexual harassment].
Some people call the office and
ask questions to see if what they
are experiencing is actually sexual
harassment. They ask what they
can do about it. Other instances
are more in—depth,” she said.

Those that are more in—depth
or serious are the cases that
involve.one or more persons and

have been going on for long
periods of time. In the last five
years there have been app-
roximately ﬁve serious cases
reported here at Pitt, Frampton
said. When a serious instance
does arise, many people become
involved, unlike the uncom-
plicated cases handled solely by
Frampton. Along with Frampton,
the director of Affirmative Action,
the app-ropriate dean, the
university’s legal counsel and
other pro—fessionals are involved.
Input is needed by all these
people in order for the best
decision to be made, said
Frampton. She said this ensures
“due process before decisions.”

In serious matters the
Affirmative Action Office gathers
complaints against the in-
dividuals. Representatives of the
Office talk to as many witnesses
as possible about the situation.
The :d are welcome to read
all ct... paints and statements
concerning them and to respond,
said Frampton.

“Both sides have a right to
know about an accusation. It is
never one-sided," Frampton said.
When the accused are told of the
charges against them, many say
that they were misunderstood or
the person(s) took the comment
the wrong way. Another common
response is that they were only

joking and what they said was
taken out of context, according
to Frampton.

After being accused, depending
on the seriousness of the case
and the group decision on the
punishment, the accused may
face unpleasant consequences.
These include a salary reduction,
an unpaid absence or dismissal.
Professors that leave on absence
can usually come back, unless
their cases were very serious.

“Two professors over the last
five years have taken leaves of
absence due to sexual har-
assment. It was their choice,” she
said.

Begging helps handicapped ma

By Mark Staf
Staﬂ" Writer

It’s Friday night on the Pitt
campus. Inside a campus bar
called CJ. Bamey’s, students are
drinking, laughing, meeting and
greeting, while Steve Miller's
“Jungle Love” throbs from the
speakers.

Right next door in a restaurant
named Hemingway's Cafe, as
steam climbs from their cups of
gourmet coffee, a young couple
holds hands while sharing dessert.

Meanwhile, outside, only 10
yards or so away, stands a black
man who has only one arm and
one leg. His nose runs into his
mustache as he holds an old
whipped-cream container that has
a hole in the lid which serves as
the passageway for a few dollars

, worth of change that rattles inside.

On his thin, faded coat, a sign is
pinned which reads in neatly
printed letters, “Please help the
handicapped.”
It is 38 degrees Fahrenheit. '
On May 10, 1968, when he was
9 years old, Karl Harris was hit by

       
     

a train in a section of Pittsburgh
called Lawrenceville. The accident
almost killed him and was
responsible for the loss of his left
arm and left leg. Now, at the age
of 32, he stands on one leg with
the help of a crutch, patiently and

‘passively waiting for passersby
_ to drop any extra change they

have into his container.

He is a thin man who keeps his
extra coat sleeve tucked into his
old and thin coat. He also keeps
the extra pant leg of his gray
slacks hidden. On his head he
wears a tassle cap which reads,
“It’s cool to be warm.” His mild
and pleasant personality -is
consistent, even when he explains
the accident and the changes that
he has undergone.

“It made me feel a whole lot
different towards people,” he says,
smiling frequently as he speaks
in a soft voice. “Before I got hurt,
I used to do a lot of wild stuff. I
hung out with some wild people.
We used to go around and steal
people’s bikes.”

A young woman walks by, stops
and puts $1 into his container.

down and take life seriously,” he
said.

Akhough he says he has learned
to be nicer since the accident,
Harris says that he also learned
that the world is a very unfair
place for the handicapped.

Harris says, “I notice that people
take your handicap a Whole 10[
different than if you had
everything. They figure thatsince
you’re handicapped you Car1’t C10
so much, but the thing is, if they
really sit down and gave you a
chance, they could see that you
can do just about everything they
can do.”

A male student walks up to
Harris and puts $1 into his
container. Harris thanks him and
tells him to have a nice weekend.
“They should see what you could
do before they criticize,” he says.

Harris says that now he is used
to his handicap and can do just
about anything except for things
that would require a lot of physical
labor, such as lifting.

The Christmas season is also
favorable for Harris because
people are more generous. He
also prefers the summer months
because of the warm ‘weather,
but feels the financial pinch
because there are less students.

Harris says that he has a lot of
freedom in his style of making
money. “Basically if you work for

your own hours. It’s not really
what you want to do, but it’s

A young woman comes up and
hands him a large Styrofoam cup.
“You look cold,” she says, “Do
you like hot chocolate?”

Harris politely accepts the hot
choc olate and thanks her. They
smile at each other, and she walks
away.

“Some people really keep me

and that warms youiup,” he said.

Not everyone is nice to Harris.

criticize and degrade him.

The tape, produced by the
Public Broadcasting System,
showed how students protested
racism through events like sit-
ins, in which students refused to
leave counters in restaurants.

At this time black people were
not allowed to even be in certain
restaurants.

In that scene, white people
who didn’t want blacks in their
restaurants beat them up. The
black people refused to ﬁght back.
The police arrived and arrested
the black people for disorderly
conduct.

The video was filled with such
examples of people acting non-
violently against something they
felt was wrong and then being
hurt and arrested for their beliefs.

“I am not asking people to get
arrested or hurt for trying to stop
the war,” Eirene said during his
talk.

“In the pastl have talked more
people into not going to jail than
going. Someone going to jail not

They have to be aware of what
they are getting into when they
go to jail and have to be mentally
ready. In this current student
movement, no one student is
ready to go to jail, but they are
ready to awaken the world to the
wrongs of war through acts of
non-violence.”

Eirene sees three things that
non-violence as a way of life
consists of: solitude, generosity
and confrontation.

“A priest who was imprisoned
by the Nazis once said that all
great changes come through
solitude,” Eirene said,

“It is going to have to be out of
individuality, out of a sense of
solitude, that we say, ‘I commit
myself, for the rest of my life, to
make a change.’ Now your
solitude could be through prayer,

meditation, art or listening to
music. Only you can decide for
yourself if war is wrong, and you
do it in solitude."

Eirene had this to say about
generosity in regard to non-
violencez “We have to generous
to each other. We can be very
selfish, and that must stop. We
must learn to give selﬂessly. The
first casualty of this war is the
homeless because of the money
we put into the war effort.”

“If we are going to counter this
heinous joke of Jan. 15 —— the
actual birthday of Martin Luther
King— if we are going to confront
this,” said Eirene, "then we have

to confront this with love, and we
need to make an individual
decision that Jan. 15 is not the
deadline for a war."

Brutus ended the seminar by
opening a discussion about what
students could do to end the war.

"I think we should research
how much American corporations
are involved in the [Persian] Gulf
crisis and how economically they
are involved elsewhere,” said
Brutus.

He also mentioned that certain
people on campus can help
students register as conscientious
objectors, when a student offered
that as a method of protest.

“All sexual harassment is
serious, ” said Frampton. Yet many
cases, such as minor instances,
are solved more easily. Minor
cases are handled by Frampton,
who confronts the person being
accused or writes a letter to him
or her.

“When they know they are
being watched, the problem
sometimes stops,” she said.

Frampton uses this example as
a minor case: A female student

one-time incident. The office then
talks or writes to the professor
and says that if this occurred, it is
unacceptable behavior.

“Power is a problem,” she said.
“It plays a big part in sexual
harassment.”

When people call in with

complaints of sexual harassment, ,

Frampton often asks, “Do you
feel this is a pattern? Do you feel
that they have power over you? If
a person feels that the other has
power over them, it is a problem,”
said Frampton.

jesse Helms in Pennsylvania?

All around the country, state governments battle to pass
laws which will protect motorists from such hazards as

drunk drivers. Everywhere, that is, except in Pennsylvania,

where representatives are attempting to regulate not only
motorists’ driving but also their morals.

Last month the Pennsylvania state legislature passed a
bill, signed by Gov. Robert Casey, which prohibited the

production, sale and display of offensive bumper stickers.

This new law was the brainchild of Erie representative
Thomas Scrimenti. “The ones that I find repulsive make

reference to defecation [in terms of] ‘something happens,”’

he said. “T hat’s the one that makes me ﬂy off the handle.” '
Obviously it must have, for under this new law any
motorist caught displaying an obscene bumper sticker

could possibly face up to five years in prison and a

$10,000 fine.

This means that a person who kills someone could face
a lighter sentence than a person who places an “obscene”

bumper sticker on a car.

This law is not only ridiculous but unfair as well. One
reason for this bill’s unfairness is the stiff punishment. A
fine is one thing. But putting a person in jail for five years
for displaying a bumper sticker that someone else ﬁnds

offensive is an outrage.

More importantly, however, is the fact that the bill is a
ﬂagrant violation of the First Amendment as well. It takes
away a person's right to free speech and expression.

Besides Pennsylvania, six other states have a bumper-
sticker law of this nature. All of them are in the South,
where morals are judged by the likes ofjesse Helms. This

type of “morality” is now spreading North.

This law was added to a bill which was originally aimed
at increasing the list of things which can be considered
obscene, namely videotapes and live performances.

According to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, only
things which “depict or describe in a patently offensive
Way sexual conduct and lack serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value” fall into this category.

That rules out Scrimentiﬂs current pet peeve, as it could
be considered simply offensive but not obscene.

Finally, this amendment is laughable because it will be
nearly impossible to enforce. State police have enough to
do without having to become bumper-sticker sticklers.

111 the past year many cases have gone through the legal
3Ystem on obscenity charges, only to be saved by the First

Amendment. Sooner or later, this law must pass by the
Wayside as a constitutional violation of it as well.

Editor's actions unprofessional

I would like to address two
issues about which I am
concerned — impartiality in
reporting and journalism and the
American military presence in
the Middle East. Fortunately at
this time, both issues coincide;
for on Saturday, Dec. 8, 1990,
Scot Ross, editor of ThePittNew$,
appeared in a photograph on the
front page of ThePr't1sbwgh Press.
Conveniently, in the photograph,
Scot was holding a sign that read
“I can’t see why or what for.” The
picture was taken at a
demonstration at Carnegie
Mellon, where approximately 200
students protested the U.S.
military buildup in the Middle
East. Apparently Scot did not
understand “why or what for” the
president has chosen to deploy
our armed forces to the Persian
Gulf region.

I believe from the bottom of
my heart that Scot, as editor of
such an outstanding information
source as The Pitt News, would at
least attempt to disguise his
leanings to the left. It is important
for any journalist who would like
to gain the credibility and respect
of members of the interested
community to appear to be
impartial and unbiased. Well, for
those of the interested community
who saw Scot’s picture on the
front page of the Press, Scot’s
credibility and the credibility of

The Pitt News have now become
suspect.

Aside from Scot’s complete lack
of professionalism, he displayed
one of two characteristics which
should not be part of the character
of an editor of a respectable
newspaper: ignorance or
complete partiality. Personally, I
think Scot should plead the former

and perhaps be excused on the_

grounds that he cannot control
the situation. If pictures could
V only have sound so that I could
hear what Scot was screaming as
he was holding his sign above his
head, I might be able to ascertain
what Scot was doing at the
demonstration. Isomehow cannot

Letters

believe that Scot was getting the
news while it was hot.

Now Scot and others of his
leaning can_ write to the
newspaper, if they feel that they
can still maintain credibility
through publication in The Pitt
News, and comment on how Scot
has every right to protest and
scream and speak against the
government as ishis right under
the First Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution. 1 am sure that
included within the full panoply
of rights vested in our citizens,
Scot even has a Constitutional
right or at least a liberty interest to
be ignorant — so he has that
going for him. I agree completely
that Scot has every right to
demonstrate and speak out
against our president’s hardline
policy concerning the Iraqi
invasion of a peaceful nation and
Saddam Hussein’s brutal
treatment and murder of Kuwaiti
citizens. Scot, the editor of ThePitt
News, has the right to and has in
fact demonstrated against the
president’s policy concerning
Iraq. Scot, however, has
implicated the institution for
which he works. Now The Pitt
News has become less than a
credible source of unbiased news.

Next I would like to address
the president’s policy concerning
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and
dominance in the Gulf region
generally. I feel thatl can proceed
because I in no way even pretend
to represent an impartial
institution. I think that public
support for President Bush's
policy concerning the Gulf is
overdue yet still a dominant
position despite polls and studies
conducted by institutions such as

The Pitt News and its brethren. I
am confident that people who
support the president’s position
are not as reactionary as Scot
Ross and other activists who
openly speak out ‘against the

government when they feel peace
needs a chance. I guess that is a
characterization suspect to
prejudice on my part, but I am
pretty sure I have a constitutional
right or at least a liberty interest to
discriminate between ideo-

logies.[...l

American war illegal

“On to Richmond, on to
Richmond’ was the battle cry of
Horace Greeley in 1861. The rich
and inﬂuential newspaper baron
was insisting that the Union army
could virtually walk into
Richmond and the Deep South
without hardly firing a shot and
destroy the Confederacy with one
stroke. Unfortunately he didn't

- bother to ask the Confederate

forces if they were willing to
stand and ﬁght for their land. A
short time later he had his answer,
as the so-called Army of the
Potomac was sent reeling in panic
and utter defeat back to
Washington after the courageous
stand of Stonewall Jackson and
hisrnen at (Bull Run).The Marines
lost 1,000 dead at Tarawa Atoll
for a piece of real estate called
Betio, about 320 acres in size.
The Okinawan campaign cost
our forces over 12,000 dead,
fighting a determined enemy. In
both cases the U.S. forces had
overwhelming air,‘ land and naval
support. The Russian army in
1945 suffered over 300, 000dead
and wounded just to take the city
of Berlin. Are the young people
in this country willing to accept
losses like this in an unlawful war
designed for no other end than to
keep the power in the hands of a
few inﬂuential people around
the world? I hope not. If the Iraqi
people.show the same resolve as
they did fighting Iran for eight
years, our dead and wounded
will be many, especially if the
United States tries to invade Iraq
itself. l...l

Panthers hammer Syracuse 93-79 as Shorter r

S/907/“fer breozles out ofslump wit/9 32-point effort  

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

After being out-rebounded 24-
13 in the first half last night, and
with Darren Morningstar and
Chris McNeal struggling and Brian
Shorter suffering the longest
slump of his career, it looked like
head coach Paul Evans was going
to have to bring Bobby Martin off

the bench — civvies, cast and all p

-—— to provide some inside punch
for the Panthers last night against
the Syracuse Orangemen. But
Martin can relax.

Right when people were ready
to write off Shorter’s —— and the
Panthers’ — season if his slump
continued,’ the 6—foot-6 forward
collected a season-high 32 points
(22 in the second half) and 11
rebounds in the 17th—ranked
Panthers’ 93-79 victory over
eighth-ranked Syracuse last night
at the Civic Arena.

During one second-half stretch,
Shorter (averaging only 11.4
points and 5.5 rebounds per
game) scored eight points in two
minutes, giving the Panthers the
lead for good.

“We never gave up on him, no
matter what everyone else around
Pittsburgh was saying about him, ”
said Jason Matthews.

“Brian’s been dealing with a lot
of adverse conditions lately, and
it was good to see him come back
like that,” said guard Sean Miller.
“He’s getting his strength back
and working hard. There’s
nothing really more [he] can do."

Coming off a seven-point, six-

rebound effort in a loss at
Connecticut, Shorter arrived ready
to work early last night. Before
the team bus left for the Arena,
Shorter was practicing dunks, post
moves and free throws at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“I felt pretty good [last nightl,”
said Shorter. “I told everybody
that after the first dunk la one-
handed power slam with 1:33
gone in the game], I was back. I
knew that was gonna be it. My
confidence had been down in
the last few games, and that
helped a lot.” The dunk was
Shorter’s first of the season.

Shorter has been recovering
from a viral infection since
October and only recently has
been able to play for lengthy

periods. His 35 minutes against

the Orangemen is the most action
he has seen this year.

The Orangemen out-
rebounded Pitt 24-13 in the first
half, while Syracuse big men
LeRon Ellis and Billy Owens
dominated them in the paint.

And with Martin out two to
four weeks after having surgery
on a finger last Thursday, Pitt’s
inside game looked to be in
trouble.

“He played really well,” said
forward McNeal. “Brian’s back
now. He showed everybody that
he’s ready to play in the Big East.
We knew he had it in him — that
he would explode one of these
times.”

Shorter’s second—ha1f stats (22
points, eight rebounds, 12 for 12

As Brian Shorter goes, so goes the Pitt
Panther basketball team.

The senior forward looked as if he had
finally gained the upper hand on the viral
infection that had plagued him since the
first day of practice back on Oct. 15, as he
led the 17th—ranked Panthers to a 9379
upset of No. 8 Syracuse last night at the
Civic Arena. A crowd of 16,485 saw Pitt
hand the Orangemen the first blemish on
their 4-0 road record going into last night’s
contest. ‘

Shorter finished with 52 points while
shooting a perfect 14 out of 14 mark from
the free—throw line, and he pulled down
11 boards en route to his best game of the
season.

“It’s been a mental thing with Brian for
the last week,” Pitt Coach Paul Evans said.
“Tonight I came into the locker room, and
Ox [Shorter] was sitting there by himself.
He said, ‘Coach, 1 got down here early. I
worked on my post moves. 1 dunked the
ball three or four times. I'm ready.’

“I think the first dunk of the game got his
spirits up a little bit, and the crowd got him
going, and hopefully he’s back.”

Shorter looked like the player of old
when he led the Panthers in scoring (20.6
ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg) last year.
His timing could not have been more
perfect, for the Panthers have just lost

eturns to form

center Bobby Martin for two to four weeks
because of an infection in his right middle
finger. With Shorter’s sub-par games prior

to last night, Pitt’s inside attack appeared

to be an area of concern. Darren
Morningstar and Chris McNeal were able
to escape with average performances (16
points, six boards) as Shorter shined in the
low post.

“It’s been a mental thing, and l’ve had a
lot of pressure on me this year — being
out sick — and my confidence was down,”
Shorter said. “Tonight I. just told myself to
come on out and play ball.”

Shorter’s power slam off a Jason
Matthews assist only a minute and a half
into the game sparked a solid Panther run
where Pitt lost the lead only once in 15
minutes. In the final three minutes of the
first half, Billy Owens knocked down
three field goals, and his fellow Orange hit
five of six free throws to post SU’s biggest
lead of the game: a four—point advantage
with 1:41 to go. But fouls by Conrad
McRae and Michael Edwards allowed
Shorter, Jermaine Morgan and Sean Miller
to hit five free throws and end the half with
a 42-41 lead. ‘

Pitt was crushed in the rebounding
department, as Owens and Dave Johnson
contributed 12 of SU’s 24 first—half boards.
The Panthers finished up with only 13 for »
the half, as Shorter led with three.

Shorter scored 12 points in a mere 3:29

“I’ve felt a lot of pressure this

‘Indeed, Pitt’s 2-3 zone spelled
disaster for the Orangemen, as
they wound up shooting only 43

20 percent from three-point range.
In contrast the Panthers hit 55
percent from the field (.500 3 pt.)
and hit a tremendous 90.6 percent
of their free throws.
But the game was not without
its anxious moments for the victors
The Panthers had trouble with
SU’s full- court press midway
through the second half, and
Morgan, Darelle Porter and
Morningstar each took his turn
forcing panicked shots after the

Panthers managed to cross

But Matthews sealed SU’s fate
with some made-for—'I'V heroics
at the 1:15 mark. Matthews hit a
three—pointer with one second
left on the shot clock to put Pitt
up by 10.

“I took a quick peek up at the
shot clock, and I saw it with
about five or six [seconds left].
lMcNeal] threw me the ball, and
I knew I had to shoot it, so I did
what I could with it,” Matthews
said.

Wrestlers hope to deep freze

By Bob Maselli
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestlers know that
they have a tough task ahead of
them tonight. They will be going
up against some of the best
wrestlers in the nation — from
No. 3—ranked Arizona State.

Arizona State has seven
nationally ranked wrestlers,
including Ray Miller in the 158-
pound class (ranked second),J.T.
Taylor at 167 (ranked ﬁfth), and
Rex Holman at 190 (ranked sixth).

Taylor wrestled Pitt’s Shawn
Gibbs at the Las Vegas
Tournament back in early
December and came away with
the victory.

The biggest match of the night
could be at 158 pounds, where
two of the best grapplers in the
country will go head to head. No.
2—ranked Miller and the Panthers’
Scott Hovan, who holds a No. 4
ranking, will fight it out in possibly
the biggest match of the year for
each man. '

be a good matchup, ” said Panther
head coach Rande Stottlemyer.
“Two of the best wrestlers in the
nation will go at it.”

Stottlemyer knows that this will
be a tough match for his men, but
he goes into every match with a
feeling of being able to beat
anyone.

“I’m forever an optimist,” said
Stottlemyer. “If we wrestle hard
and smart, anything can happen. ’
It will be a monumental task, and
I know it won’t be easy, but we’ll
show up and see what happens.”

Stottlemyer also knows that it’s
always hard coming back after

‘the holiday season. He put his

team through the paces before
the semester break, hoping that
when the wrestlers. came back,
they wouldn’t be in bad shape.
“I’m concerned about jumping
right into it, but we worked hard
right after finals. It was a bear,

and it was a very productive,

time,” Stottlemyer said.

Stottlemyer is counting on all
of his men to come through
tonight, even though they don’t
have the accolades that the
Arizona State team boasts.

“All of my guys aren’t ranked,
but they can hold their own.
Perry Miller [at heavyweight],
Gibbs, Hovan and Brian O’Korn
at 118 will have big matches.
Especially O’Korn: his match
will be the pivotal match of the
night.” The Panthers will lock

THE prrr NEWS. Tuesday. January 8, 1991

By Ryan Buncher
staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team reached
the second round of the NCAA
tournament last season before
losing to Nebraska. It was the
farthest the Lady Panthers had
advanced in the team’s history.
The team also ﬁnished at 31-6, its
best record since 1987.

“rm proud of the players,” said
Coach Sue Woodstra. “We did
just what we could« do. When
you’re moving up, you have to

‘ take things one step at a time.

«we won the matches we
should have won, except the
third time we played Duke. When
you move into the Top 20, it’s
hard to move up quickly,” she
added.

The Lady Panthers were able to
beat a strong Duke team twice, as
well as beat Big Ten champ

‘Wisconsin early in the season.

They upset Ohio State, a team
they lost to in the regular season,
in the first round of the NCAA
tournament.

Pitt dominated the Big East,
winning all 10 matches they
played against conference
opponents on its way to its third
consecutive Big East
Championship, the first time that
had been done. Only one of the
Lady Panthers’ matches, the
championship game against
Georgetown, even went five
games.

Pitt was unable to beat any Top
10 teams, losing to UCLA and
twice to Penn State in the regular
season and to the second-ranked
Cornhuskers in the NCAA
Tournament.

“We need taller players,”
Woodstra said when asked what
the team needed to compete with
Top-10 opponents. “Nebraska
and all the top teams are big.”

Injuries were a problem for the
Lady Panthers, but Woodstra said
that had little effect on how far
the team progressed.

Freshman Ann-Marie Lucanie,
a standout player from the
beginning of the season, missed
about a month of play with an

ankle injury. Freshman Carrie
Thornton injured her knee in
preseason, and after playing in a
few matches, underwent season-
ending knee surgery, junior
Bridget Gary was bothered by a
knee problem much of the season
and ﬁnally had to have surgery
after the Big East tournament.
They are expected to return next
season.

Two players thatwill not return
next year are the team's
graduating seniors, setter Jenelle
Lantagne and middle hitter
Michele Adamson. Both were on
the All-Big East team, and
Lantagne was the Big East Player
of the Year. Woodstra said she is
currently recruiting setters to
replace Lantagne.

 

Juniors Dee MacAuley, Susan
Zonneville and Linda Zols will
join Lucanie as returning starters
next season. Junior Heather
Hollands, who started while
Lucanie was injured, also returns.
All were keys to a team whose
strength was its balance.

Bulls open MILL season with 19-goal barrage

By Ryan Buncher
ﬂq7WHwr

No. 66 led an offensive-minded
Pittsburgh team to victory Saturday
night, but it was not Mario Lemieux

, making an early return to the

Penguins.

It was the Pittsburgh Bulls
opening their second season in
the Major Indoor Lacrosse League
by defeating the Baltimore

Thunder in a 19-10 scoring fest.

No. 66 is Butch Marino, one of
three Bulls who had hat tricks in
the game. Marino scored five
goals and dished out two assists
on the way to being named the
game’s MVP.

Before the contest a
proclamation by Mayor Sophie
Masloff was read declaring Jan. 5
as Dave Pietramala Day in honor
of the Bulls’ defenseman who

was named MVP of the World
Games. Pietramala led the U.S.
National Team to the
championship.

Pietramala had only two assists.
Surprisingly he had no penalties
last Saturday after setting the
league record for most penalties
in a season in 1990.

Brian Nikula, a 1990 All.-MILL
selection, had four goals and two
assists. Brian “The Admiral” Keith,

These awareness projects will

Onjan. 14 PSAW is sponsoring
a sleep-over vigil on the lawn in
front of the William Pitt Union.
Participants will mark the time
until the deadline expires by
distributing information about the
Gulf crisis.

Pamphlets detailing procedures

for declaring oneself a
conscientious objector to serving
in combat will be made available.
Justin Hopper outlined the requ-
irements: “[M]ake them absolutely
believe you’d rather go to jail
than to war,” Hopper said.

Day summed up his attitude
toward a potential draft. “Hey, if
they draft me, I'm sick,” said Day.

said" Castek.

The ﬂyer presents a few orhérl .

immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
troops, nuclear weapons, aircraft
carriers and other weapons of
mass destruction from the Persian
Gulf. PSAWseeks the elimination
of proposed temporary or
permanent U.S. military bases in

the region, along with legislation 4&7.

to prohibit the president from
usurping war powers delegated
to Congress, and peaceful
diplomatic efforts to end the Gulf
crisis. PSAW also wants taxpayers’
money to be spent on domestic

problems rather than on military

offensives, and the group
encourages research and
development of alternative energy
sources to prevent the United
States from falling victim to
another oil war in the future.

Castek said she hopes to obtain
a recording of Martin Luther King's
“I Have a Dream” speech to play
at the peace camp in memory of
King’s work with student activism
in the 19605. Jan. 15 is King’s
birthday.

Tickets to the national peace
march to Washington, D.C., which
is scheduled forjan. 26, might be
available for sale. The Thomas
Merton Center is handling
arrangements, according to a ﬂyer
passed out at the meeting.

On Jan. 15, the peace camp
will conclude with a peace march,
tentatively scheduled to end at
the door to the Office of John
Marous, chairperson of the Board
of Trustees at Pitt, according to
Castek. PSAW hopes to convince
Marous to encourage the
university as a whole to make a
public statement decrying Bush's
policy in the Gulf, Laus said.

Day suggested a boycott of
classes on Jan. 16 if the conflict
has not been resolved.

PSAW held a peace march and
rally on Dec. 7, 1990, and the
large turnout has inspired hopes
of a similar showing of support
next week. The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported that appro-
ximately 2SO students attended
the events, but Castek said that
all of the 375 ﬂyers produced for
the occasion had been dispersed.

“I was very happy with the
turnout,” said Laus.

Jill Moore, a senior at Carnegie
Mellon, was also impressed.

“We have a really apathetic
campus, so just for a hundred
people to show up for a rally 
that's a lot of people,” she said.
“To have that many people come
[from CM] is just amazing.”

But Laus measured the success
of the event differently.

“We didn’t stop the war,” she
said.
