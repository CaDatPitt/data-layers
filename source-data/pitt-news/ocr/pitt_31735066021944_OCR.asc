Trees Hall in need of upgrading  

By Teresa Candori

‘Managing Editor

The Student Government
Board recently undertook a
project to have athletic facilities
at Trees Hall upgraded.
However, SGB efforts may be
premature, as ‘university plans to
acquire funding are already un-
derway. _

”Right now, we're talking to
administrators to see if they're

,5 receptive to the idea,” SGB Presi-

dent Phil Moyer said Monday.
”The administrators I've spoken
to recognize the problem. They
realize it's time to start upgrading
the facilities/.’- _
Having realized the problem,
the administration has already

I taken action to obtainstate fund— I

ing. According to Joseph Dutton,
university vice president for bus-

 iness and finance, the university

has already requested the money

, to upgrade Trees Hall from the

state.

”We will know [ifthe request

has been approved] when the
capital budget is finally passed,
hopefully sometime during the
\summer months,” Dutton said.
\. Moyerfsaid he was planning to
‘ubmit a resolution to the univer-

BAS stages anti-apartheid demonstrations  

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

In honor of those who have
died in South Africa because of
apartheid, Pitt's Black Action So-
ciety held a memorial service
yesterday — one demonstration
in a week of events intended to
urge the university's board of
trustees to "divest all financial

\ holdings in.South Africa. ‘

”Not only is it-[keeping invest- I

ments in South Africa] morally
wrong, but it's economically
wrong,” said Gail Austin, a mem-
ber of the Pitt Divestment Coali-
tion, one of a number of groups
co-sponsoring the demon-
strations. , ’

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the

\ rblack studies department, said:

”We are here to remind people

. on this campus [that] people are

5’

dying in South Africa. As long as
we are invested in South Africa,
we are involved in the killings.
This university will not lose any

money by getting out of racism.”. .

Brutus did say, however, that
Pitt has made some progress. ’’It

reduced their investments. I be-
lieve that is a result ofthe pres-

sure we have been putting on —

them over the years. That pres-

is to their credit they have .

sity about upgrading the facilities
and that he had consulted sever-
al athletic equipment companies.

”I thought I was doing more
than most peoplewere doing, but
apparently some people were do-
ing more,” Moyer said. ”The way
it was explained to me was that
it gets as far as physical plant, but
that no one ever comes up with
the money. I'm pleased to know
that the university has taken
enough interest in [upgrading
Trees Hall] to send it as far as the
state.”

Dutton said the university does
not have the funds to upgrade the
facilities itself. A

”We’d be glad to do it if some-
one would give us a gift for it,”
he said. ”We do have a small
fund to be used to upgrade all the

facilities at all the university’

buildings,” but he added that
renovation of Trees Hall would
be a
project.”

Edward Bozik, director of ath-I

letics at Pitt agreed that Trees Hall
facilities are inadequate for a
university of Pitt's size.

”The building was never com-

pleted as it was originally intend-
ed,” Bozik said. ”And- it was

sure will continue.

”We will not give up until we
are sure Pitt has taken every pen-
ny out of apartheid,” said Brutus.

The BAS and the other organi-
zations that are supporting total

,divestment began erecting three

crosses a day on the William Pitt

”multi—million dollar,

z

intended for a student body a lot
smaller.” He added that the base-
ment of the building was never
fully excavated. The unfinished
room is approximately 260 feet
by 137 feet. ’

”The facilities are adequate for
intercollegiate athletics,” he said.
”There should be some improve-
ment for the general student
body, faculty and staff.” He cit-
ed the need for better locker fa-
cilities and better access to the
handball and squash courts.

According to Bozik, the athlet-
ic teams have weight rooms that

are fully funded by the athletic '

department and by donations,
but because of time and space

' restrictions, the weight‘ rooms are
. not accessible to non-athletes.

”|mprovement of Trees Hall
has been on the physical plant
improvement list for a number of
years, but it hasn't been a high
enough priority,” Bozik said.

Moyer said he has not decided
what he will do if the Trees Hall

renovation is rejected by the :

state.
’’I’m going to have to wait un-
til the time comes," he said. ”I

.have to find out what_.I am able

to do.”

Union lawn last Thursday to sym-
bolize and eulogize the death of
students in South Africa. A total
of 20 crosses, bearing the names

of students who have died, have

been erected. _
According to a statement is-
sued by the BAS, ”The situation

 

in South Africa has become
progressively worse. Students in
South Africa are being killed for
their role as protestors against the
oppressive South Africa regime.

Even the students who are not ac-j ‘

tively protesting are being shot at
randomly. This ‘reminds us of the

THE PI1T News, Wednesday May 27, 1987

Reagan says attacks muststop; death toll up  

BAGHDAD, Iraq — Americans
investigating the'|raqi attack on
the USS Stark met with defense
officials Tuesday amid reports
that Iraq may have killed the pi-
lot that fired the missile that
struck the Stark.

Sources said Iraq has been stall-
ing repeated requests by the team
of investigators to talk with the
pilot.

A‘ diplomatic source said

. ”everything seems to be going‘

well” in the joint investigation of
the May 17 attack in the Persian
Gulf, which killed 37.American
sailors on the guided-missile
frigate and wounded 21.

Unconfirmed reports in the Ira-
qi _capital Tuesday said the pilot
had been beheaded, apparently
for embarrassing President Sad-
dam Hussein's government. In-
formation Ministry officials
denied it.

The eight-man U.S. team led by
Rear Adm..David Rogers,~deputy
director of operations for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, spent several
hours with senior Iraqi officials
Tuesday morning.

Bakkers kicked out

of posh home by PTL

FORT MILL, S.C. — The PTL
announced Tuesday thatlim and
Tammy Bakker are being evicted
from a $413,000-estate it owns,
prompting the Bakkers to say they
may have to sell the home where
they have been secluded since a
sex scandal forced them to resign
the ministry.

The move comes amid an-
nouncements by new PTL leader
Jerry Falwell that the ministry
must raise $3 million by Friday or
go out of business. Falwell has al-
ready said about $3.5 million has
been raised in a massive week-
long fund-raising campaign.

”I’m not crying wolf here,” Fal-
well said. ”We have to have over
$3 million by Friday, or we close
the doors.” . '

According to Falwell, . the
ministry must raise $7 million by
May 31 and $25 million within
90 days, or it will permently shut
down. He blames a huge $66
million debt on the Bakkers and

their key associates.

The Bakkers refused comment,
but longtime friend Joanne
Thompson said they learned of
the eviction notice on Friday, and
told her they may have to sell
their current house to help get out
of their current financial
predicaments.

Ride leaving NASA
_for new teaching post

SPACE CENTER, Houston — '

Sally K. Ride, the first American
woman to fly in space, is leaving
the astronaut corps to take a po-
sition at Stanford University, her
alma mater, NASA announced

day, will be leaving the National

SEOUL, South:Korea — Presi-

cabinet members Tuesday in an
attempt to quiet outrage over the
death of a student under police
questioning. Critics demanded
Chun’s resignation.

Thousands of students chanting
”Down with the government that
uses torture and murder” staged
anti-government protests,‘ and
some fought riot police.

Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome has become a major
concern of our nation and the
world. It has been targeted by
health professionals as well as
politicians as one of our greatest
health enemies.‘ In Pittsburgh,

"there is a special force that was

created to help educate people
about this incurable syndrome.
The Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force
attempts to address the AIDS is-
sue with compassion. Kerry
Stoner, executive director and
president of the task force said
that the group was formed in
1985 from a community-based
grass roots group who wanted to
change the lack of quality care for

‘AIDS patients and to educate

people accurately.

”The goal of the organization
is to promote compassion and
understanding for AIDS patients
and AIDS-related issues,” accord-
ing to Tim Ziaukas, public rela-

and his or her transportation
needs.

This support service sometimes
extends to the client's family,
lover and friends. ”This support
is important,” said Ziaukas, ”be-
cause AIDS is a communication
problem as well as a medical
problem.”

Other client-oriented services
include an AIDS information line,
where volunteers confidentially
answer questions and refer clients
to the proper agencies.

‘ Another service is the Ombuds-
man Committee. This is a team of
professionals with experience in
public health, social work and
civil rights issues that may affect
the clients. They work with
clients on issues such as discrimi-
nation in employment, insurance

_ and housing.

Educating, though, _is one of the
group's primary purposes.

”Prevention is the urgent sto-
ry,” said Ziaukas. Task Force

‘volunteers promote safer sex by,

advertising in Out magazine, the

Task forceoffers moral support
for AIDS patients and families

and ordinary,as brushing one’s
teeth or combing one’s hair.”
Past education programs in-
cluded ”People of Colors,”
AIDS education and prevention
for blacks and those of other ra-
cial origins, and ”Women at
Risk,” a program in which volun-
teers located and organized

resources to address the increas-

ing concern for the women of
Pittsburgh.

The task force addresses the
public at large with their speak-
er's bureau. Experts are provided

to address community groups,

universities, professional health
care organizations, crisis inter-
vention teams and churches. Its
main purpose is to keep people
in touch. - ~ I
The University of Pittsburgh
has one of only four centers to
study AIDS in this country. It also
has the Pitt Men's Study, which
Ziaukas said ”saved lives."
The study reached the high-risk
group in Pittsburgh at an early
stage and educated them about

The Black Adoption Serv-
ices of the Three Rivers Adop-
tion Council, in association
with the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Office of Urban and
Community Services and the
School of Social Work, held
their fourth conference at the
William Pitt Union last
Thursday. I

theme of the seminar. Approx-

According to Azizi Powell,

Powell said the agency was
formed ‘for several reasons.
First of all, it was very difficult
for black and inter-racial cou-
ples to adopt children because
most agencies were for middle
and upper—class whites.

Also, there was a dispropor-
tionately high number of black
children in Allegheny County
in need of adoption. Accord-
ing to Powell, 8 percent of the
children in Allegheny County
are black, 55 percent of the
children in foster care are
black and 45 percent of the
children available for adoption
are black.

man who would be president.

Actually, this man is for real.
His name is Charles Richard

He and the wife will be trek-

THE PITT: NEWS, Wednesday May 27, I987

A true tale of rebellion

I traveled to Peshewar, a city in
Pakistan, in order to cross the Af-
ghan border, which I succeeded
in doing after about seven hours
on the night of May 7.

Forty Mujahadeen, (Afghan
freedom fighters) and I got about
twenty kilometers inside of Af-
ghanistan to observe a major
Soviet armored movement -
perhaps 12,000 Soviet troops
moved down a. road for four
hours straight to their big base
near Khowst. My party received
a 20-minute rocket barrage, but
we returned to Pakistan un-
harmed. I

The Soviets are exploiting and
exporting the resources from
there —- primarily natural gas.
They have been conducting a
massive defoliation project, using
herbicides and napalm, in order
to destroy any hope of a normal
lifethere after they withdraw —
over 80 perecentof farmable soil
has been made useless.

Indiscriminate bombings occur
daily on undefended civilian tar-
gets in Afghanistan, in addition to
the daily cross—border air raids on
Afghan refugee and Mujahadeen

camps. The Mujahadeen "have-

been claiming at least one MiG

or one Russian helicopter shot‘

down daily, a pretty big claim,
but both sidesexaggerate victo-

ries and deny losses. Still, if the

Russians are losing one aircraft
every three days, then that's good
news for the freedom fighters.

Some new developments in the ,

war indicate a growing reliance

from Moscow on India to per-
form their bidding in this area.
Confirmed reports existof Indian.
troops being close to Kabul, em-
ployed against the Mujahadeen.
Indian landmines and boobytraps
were also found in that area. In-
dia has some important defense
agreements with Moscow. Paki-
stan maintains 17 of their 20
"army divisions along their bord-
er with India, and they lost the
last war with India in 1971. Chi-
na is friendly with Pakistan, and
the Soviet Union supports the In-
dians. If you didn't catch this in
the paper, Indian troops have
been clashing with Chinese sold-

_ iers lately.

On the politcal front, there
have - been attempts by Dr.
Najibullah, the current president
of the Kabul puppet regime, to
win a cease-fire with the rebels,
but the rebels won't sit for that

until all Soviet troops have gone
home. The Mujahadeen respond-
ed with anything but a cease-fire,
intensifying their attacks around
Kabul to make their point. The
former leader of the Communist
Party in Kabul, Babrak Karmal,
was flown to Moscow for ”med-
ical treatment and rest,” which is
a smokescreen for his arrest and
subsequent exile followinghis at-
tempted defection to the Chinese
embassy last January.

The People's Democratic Party
of Afganistan (the Communist
Party) has been split into four fac-
tions, apparently from efforts by
Moscow to further destabilize the
area, making their presence more
important. While a segment of lo-
cal Parchammites still favor the
ousted Karmal, another Parcham-
mi faction rejects both Karmal
and Najibullah, who is backed by
the Pushto speaking Khalqis.

Dr. Najibullah recently sug-
gested that the exiled king of Af-
ghanistan, return to take up his
throne again and mediate be-
tween the rebels and Kabul, but
the Mujahadeen won't have talks
until the Soviets return. The Muj,
and other Afghans, are already
having elections for the interim
government. But, until the Rus-
sian bear limps home, there will
be no peace, only the continua-
tion of jihad and genocide.

Our love affair with war

I bought a pack of cigarettes the
other day. I bought them at the
same little store that I always do,
even though I can get them 15
cents cheaper across the street. I
go there as_ opposed to the other
place, because at my store I get
to see the drégs of society on pa-
rade. Cigarette runs are special to
me because they get me in touch
with the way the world really is,

not the tinted version of things we

get from school or TV.

On this particular day, there I

was a passel of kids huddled

around a new video game. Dead-

end kids mostly, the kind "that
seem to be everywhere, and who

‘make you instinctively check to

insure that your wallet’s still in
you backpocket when you, walk
past them. ‘ .

One of them was playing the
new game, and the crowd around
him watched with much en-

" thusiasm, making shooting noises

and screaming at the top of their
little lungs.
I walked past them and a few

I thoughts raced through my head

— comparing my childhood of
grass-stained summers and catch-
ing crayfish to theirs of, dirty

streets and convenience store,

video games. .

As I paid for my precious
cigarettes, I couldn't help but no-
tice the din that these kids were
making. I looked up in the round,

- convex mirror in the corner of the

store and watched them as the
clerk tried to count out my
change correctly. I tried to read
the name of this fabulous new
game, but one of the kids’ heads
was in the way and I could only
make out the first four letters. It
read ”TNOC" (remember, I was
looking in a’ mirror). Turned
around, the letters read ”CONT”
Hmmm, what could the- remain-

  

PAIII.
, ANATER
 _
ing letters be?
I walked over to the screaming
throng and read the actual name

of the game: CONTRA. I rubbed
my eyes to make sure I was read-

‘ ing it correctly. Contra. I couldn't

believeit then, and I can't believe
it now.

If I weren't a Republican, I'd
swear a it was a White House
propaganda tool, which by the
way makes sense. ’Get kids to
look up to the Contras, and the
next generation may be a little
more accepting of foreign inter-
vention than ours is. p

More likely, it is just another
result of our society’s'|ov_e affair
with militarism. Those‘ kids,prob-
ably don't know what a Contra is
in the first place. They don't un-
derstand that through funding
them, our government is under-
mining a sovereign state. They
don't realize that in order to in-
sure this funding, the president
and a fewof his men wiped their
asses with the Constitution, broke
the law (obviously) and betrayed
the trust of the American people.

No, these kids see the charac-
ters of the game as themselves,
fighting off an oppressive enemy.‘

Kind of likeiRambo.

The game doesn't say anything
about where it takes place or
against whom the players fight,.

’ but the name itself should be

enough to make any thinking per-
son shudder.
Through this game and others

like it, kids learn the lesson that I

might makes right. More learned
participants could possibly learn
that unconstitutional funding of
virtual terrorists makesthe right
wing right. (badoom boom tush)

What's next? A Saturday morn-
ing cartoon? Most video games

' alreadyhave them. I can see it

now. It could be set up like The
Smurfs. Daniel Ortega could be
the evil wizard, liberal members
of the House and Senate could be
his helpers, and their sole pur-
pose in life would be to destroy
the cute little Contras. With the

. help of\U.S. aid, aid thatislips past

the liberal members of Congress,
the cute little Contras could al-
ways outsmart the forces of evil.

With the help of the CIA, the
pseudo-Smurfs could mine the
wizard’s main harbor, shoot old
ladies, rape young ladies, burn
middle,-aged ladies and pillage
wbatever's left. Remember, these
are the good guys.

You know, such ,a cartoon
would probably be popular, if
.only as an excuse for Ron Reagan
to get out of bed on Saturdays.
Don Regan and Ollie North
could bask in the glory of ‘what
could have been. And another
generation could become avid
readers of Soldier of Fortune
magazine. Mission‘ accom-
plished. ' ~

Sleepless nights

Q. Every morning, I wake
up and see my college
roommate’s boyfriend in

from what I want to see in
the early a.m. My own
boyfriend always goes

and I would never have sex’

  

I would be too embar-
rassed.

But my roomie and her
guy think I am asleep, or
they pretend to think it, and
they go at it with me right

/,
in the next bed. I really 
don't like this at all, but I do  

like my roommate and don't know how to tell her that this
bothers me. I have sort of told her, kiddingly, but she ignores
my comments entirely. I have to do something. What?

  

DR. RU

. A.‘ Sometimes it happens that a shy and modest person like
you has a likable ‘friend who is totally without modesty. I don't
advocate shame, but a little modesty is OK, right? So first, you
would never do such a thing as have sex in the same room with

her, then you were embarrassed to tell her you don't like her i

doing it with you in the room; now you find it hard to tell her,

, because you never raised an objection before. I tell you what

— you have to tell her because otherwise this will end badly. ‘
There will be a big bust-up and who needs it?

So you have to say to your roomate: ”Look, I have told you _
this before in a sort ofjoking way because I didn't want to criti-
cize you, but you paid no attention. So now I have to tell you
seriously that I consider this room to be ours —- mine and yours,
but not your boyfriend's. I need more privacy. I don't like a
guy in my room all night and when I am getting up, or want
to get up. My boyfriend is never here overnight, he says good-
night at bedtime, and we never have sex with you here.

”So, if you want to use the room sometimes, please tell me
and I will try to find somewhere else to be when you and your
boyfriend are being intimate —— but not every night, justonce 
in a while. Maybe in the daytime, let me know and I can put,‘

» in the time ‘constructively ‘in the library. But from now on, I want ; _
, the use of this room, which is half mine, without your boyfriend. 1- J
S in it. OK?” I

If she doesn't shape up you have to go to the resident ad-
viser. Because your roommate, even if you like her,is- taking
terrible advantage of you. It is extremely inconsiderate, and she
is flaunting her boyfriend and her sexuality with you in the next

_ bed. Which as you say, you would never do with-her.

, Q. As a faithful reader and listener, may I have an answer ._
- to a funny little question? _For some reason,'l have been won-. t _
-dering if it isjpossible for a man to_eiaculate if he is not aroused. _ I

A. It is possible, and the pleasurable quality of the ejacula- 

tion with a flaccid member varies. Often it is quite good.

Q. This is a query about temperature. Sometimes my girlfriend, _,., ., if 

and I make love at my place, sometimes at hers. I claim the.
lovemaking is better here at myplace,‘ she says it's always bet-
ter at hers. When I go to her house it is warmer than my place
- 75-80 degrees. Here, I keep it at an invigorating 60-'70 -
degrees. Is it better to make love in a hot or cold room? At

present we are students (I ’m majoring in advertising) but what‘ I. _ 

if we moved in together? _ . 3

A. I think when or if you get married, you two will need
separate bedrooms and an agreement to get together sometimes

in her room, sometimes in yours. I do see a research project - I

in your field here. Get a professor to approve a marketing
research survey showing what percentage a consumers like it
hot and how many like "it cold. _ ’

I have read a story by Peter Freuchen, the Arctic explorer,’
about the terrific lovemaking Eskimos enjoy in igloos that are

cozy by their standards, refrigerators by ours. People living at_ g All

the equator enjoy lovemaking, too.

Q. My wife says I don ’t_cuddle her enough without wanting if 
sex. I will say that cuddling seems to lead to wanting sex, but .1 ' "
it seems tome that I do hold and cuddle her a lot without ~ ’

demanding intercourse. In fact, I love, to do that.

A. Keep a‘ pad discreetly near your bed and note times and b '
dates when you have had sex or just cuddled. Very likely, she ‘
doesn't realize how often you do gratify her need for warm and"
affectionate touching without sex. After you have enough evi-
dence, show it to her. It may change her feeling about this. Or ‘
will you be the one suprised? Another research project.

THE PlTl' NEWS, Wednesday May 27, 1.987

Placement center focuses on individual needs

By Brenda McGuirk
Staff Writer

”A college degree doesn't
guarantee you a job.” With yet
another class of Pitt students
graduated, these words reveal a
biting reality to many new
graduates. ' V

According to the National
Center of Education, 985,000 stu-
dents will graduate from college
in 1987. Less than half will have
a job when they leave school. For
these graduates, the average wait-
ing period to find a job in their
field is six to nine months.

Many students panic when
they leave school without a job,
but serious worries don't set in
until they are out o_f school for a
few months. Although there are
job placement and counseling
services at most collges, few stu-
dents use the services until it is
too late.

In the past year, the University
of Pittsburgh's placement office
helped about 2,000 students,

' which is a low number consider-

ing the senior class this year was
at least double that number. The

placement center is free to’Pitt_

students and offers resume writ-
ing and mock interview work-
shops, an employer information
library and a workshopon how
to dress for an interview.

Last fall, the service held over
50 workshops. The placement
center organizes visits from cam-
pus recruiters and arranges inter-
views for students with company
representatives. .

The service also has a resume
referral service. It collects re-
sumes from students, then refers
them to companies that request
information on students with
specific, qualifications.

The center also offers place-
ment and job counseling. Staff

members help students focus on .

how to find specific jobs. The
main objective is to help students
constructively look for a job.

Pat Carr, a counselor at the
placement center, said most stu-
dents don't return to placement
after graduation, although they
may do so. Students don't know
that the resume service continues
after the recruitingseason ends.
Since students aren't aware of
this, they quickly deplete their
supply of resumes. By not keep-
ing a stack of resumes on file in
the office, the student loses out
on opportunities to get in"-
terviews.

The counselors can help get
grads get back on track in their
job search. ”We have a very ex-
tensive amount of expertise in
dissecting a student’s'job search
after grad_uation,” said Carr. One

student came into the office two
years after he graduated. He had
several jobs in that period of time
and was just drifting without any
career opportunities. Carr ana-
lyzed his job search. She saw that

. he was taking positions with no

future or advancement potential.
He was setting himself up for
failure and disappointment. In
two weeks, Carr helped him to
change his strategies and got him
looking for a job with real poten-
tial, and he found one.

”We aren't just a clearing

house of information here. We

specialize in people and redirect-
ing their job searches into some-
thing positive,” said Carr._ ’’I think
we have valuable services for
graduates that many people are
not aware of.” «
>l<**

When a senior sets out to look
for a job, his major has a lot to
do with how the job search goes
for him. According_to Carr, the
most organized and successful
job searchers are students with
technical majors such as en-
gineering or computer science.

”They are more focused. An
engineer knows what type ofjob
he or she wants because the
major trains people for a specific
job,” said Carr. ”Technical
majors get more jobs through
placement because the fields

have more jobs to offer, and the
students are well organized in
their job search.”

Most companies that send
recruiters to schools are techni-
cally based. Since the people
with technical backgrounds have
more interview opportunities
than other students, Carr focuses
on teaching these students good
interviewing skills.

”Technica| students are much
more aggressive in their job
search,” said Carr. ”The jobs
don't just fall-in their laps, but
they have a better idea of what
they want and how to go after it.
Liberal arts majors aren't trained
for a specific [job] and have trou-
ble looking for specific jobs.”

It is Carr's view that liberal arts
majors are less focused than tech-
nical majors. ”They stop into
placement later than most stu-
dents. They start to look for jobs
later than most students and get
less jobs through placement,” she
said. '

Her advice to students with
such majors is to focus on what
type of job they want that would
fit their interest and education.
The want ads usually don't adver-
tise for art historians or poets.
Carr tries to show students with

”unspecific" majors how to seek-

out employers and how to
present themselves and their

qualifications to a potential em-
ployer. Since there aren't too
many recruiters on campus for
liberal arts related jobs, many stu-
dents have to learn to market
themselves on their own. The
placement center is a good place
to learn how to do that.

With all the jobless graduates,
one might think the placement
center would be packed with
panic stricken students around
graduation time. ”Actually, the
office is pretty quiet then,” said
Carr. ”The‘ students are more
worried about finals and actual-
ly graduating instead of looking
for a job. This isn't the season for
frustration to set in. If the students

V are worried, we don't see it.”

**>l<

If a student graduates without
a job, there is still hope. Most stu-
dents will find something if they
keep looking and don't give up.
Pam, 22, graduated from Penn
State with a degree in quantitative
business analysis in May 1986. It
took her nine months to find a
job in her field. She used the
placement service as much as
possible at Penn State during her
senior year. She had some follow-
up interviews but was jobless
when she graduated. She re-
turned home to Pittsburgh unem-

University theater department gears up
for season of Shakespeare and other classics  

By Ed Tureen

For The Pitt News

What can one expect from an
evening at a University of Pitts-
burgh Theater Department
presentation? According to Atillio

. ”Buck” Favorini, chairman of the

Pitt theater arts department, one
can expect quality.

”I do not think a year has gone
by in the 17 years that I have
been associated with Pitt theater
that we did not have a play on the
10-best list of the local critics,”
Favorini said.

The theater arts department has
a busy schedule planned this year
that runs well into fall. The sched-
ule includes the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival, plays
produced by the City Theater

Company and the 1987-88 Stu-
dio and Mainstage Theater
season.

The Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival opens May 29 and runs
through Aug. 15. The festival is
producing three plays: Two Cen-
tlemen - of Verona, ‘May 29
through June -20; Cyrano de Ber-
gerac, June 26 through July 18
and Richard III, July 24 through
August 15.

The Three Rivers Shakespeare
festival began in 1980 and, ac-
cording to Favorini, is one of the
largest Shakespeare festivals in
the country. It provides the opor-
tunity, through a contract with
the Actors Equity Association, for
students and actors to come
together and put on quality theat-
er for the public.

The CitylTheater Company is
planning to produce two plays at
Hartwood Acres this summer.
The Instant City Theater Circus,
a part of the City Theater Compa-
ny, will be producing plays
throughout the city this summer.

The Studio and Mainstage
Theatre lineup for the fall will fea-
ture four plays: Educating Rita
and The Misanthrope will be on
the mainstage at Stephen Foster
Memorial Theatre, whi|e'Spring
Awakening and Baby will be

_ seen in the studio theater, locat-

ed in the basement of the
Cathedral of Learning.

The theater arts department,‘
~ which serves around 1,000 stu-

dents according to Favorini, is
hoping to consolidate their three
locations into one. Favorini

hopes the university will convert
the recently acquired Jewish
Community Center on Bellefield

Street into a performing arts fa-' I

cility. ,
- ”There has been a great deal of
discussion with the university; we
believe a decision is imminent.
And we hope the decision will be
to solve our problems,” said
Favorini. ~

Favorini said he hopes to bring ‘

more avant-garde theater to Pitts-
burgh. Healso wants to produce
seasons that are linked by a
theme. ’’I would love to see us do
a whole season based on the

theater of the absurd_and .link it’

with philosophy seminars and En-
glish literature courses to allow
the students. at the "university to

. have anexperience of immersion

in a particular topic.”

Skeptic challengesvalidity of supernatural

By Tarun. Reddy

Staff Writer

Is astrology for real?

One man who is skeptical of
the supernatural is Richard
Busch. He is a member of the
Committee for the Scientific In-
vestigation of Claims of the
Paranormal, which is based in
Pittsbu_rgh. Busch’s group has an
open invitation to any person
who, under a set of mutually
agreeable conditions, can per-
form oneparanormal act.

The reward for accomplishing
this feat is $10,000.

”We have yet to see any
paranormal acts performed in
front of_us, and this is not surpris-
ing,” said Busch. -

If there is no such thing as a

- paranormal act, then why does

the public find psychics, as-
trologers and other so—called
miracle workers so fascinating?

”We are a society obsessed
with finding the quick answers;
astrology is merely’ another
means of playing on our emo-
tions, attempting to provide an-
swers to our deepest and most
troubling problems.”

Is astrology a science? Does it .

have any statistical verifiability?

  

”All of the evidence we have
seen up to this poin.t indicates the
mathematical premises and con-
clusions of astrologers have been

grossly falsified,” Busch said.
The problem, according to."

Busch, is society's need for.know-

ling answers to as many questions

as possible. ”In the rush to find
answers, we have lost.the ability
to refute and in the process,'re—'
fine the validity of such predic-
tions,” Busch said.

He said he received a. letter
from a New Jersey psychic who.

claimed that for $14, she would '

supply a listing of lottery numbers

. rationh sheipea  E

which were guaranteed to", b
chosen. —

”If this offer were truly honest, I

it would offer a money- back
guarantee if the customer were
ever dissatisfied,” offered Busch.

Busch said when Reagan was
first inaugurated governor of

California in 1966, he requested _
that his inauguration take place at . V

12:15 a.m. A psychic supposed-
ly told Reagan that the stars were
in an advantageous position and
would bode well for his future
success.

’’If that doesn't scare you,” said 51* -
Busch, ”then nothing about as-.7 ' '

trology will surprise you.”

- ~ -E gag , 

By Susan Washburn

-  Assistant Entertainment Editor

This weekend The Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival
previews’ its first production,
Two Gentlemen of Verona.
Directed by W. Stephen Cole-
f t man, Two Gentlemen marks a

staging of Shakespeare's plays.
Two Gentlemen of Verona is
Shakespeare with an added
dimension —~ music.

While the idea of putting
Shakespeare to music is not a

 . _ new’ idea, it is not common.

W. Stephen Coleman decided
that Two Gentlemen (one of
Shakespeare's early‘ works)
needed music to fill out what
he thought to be a rather thin
script. , _ - .
Reading and rereading,
Coleman searched for an in-
terpretation that would best
serve the play. The more he
read, the more the play began
to feel like a musical or, more
A specifically, a Gilbert and Sul-
livan operetta. ’’It didn't speak
to me in context.  Singing

departure from the traditional ' '

made sense,” he said.

This merry Victorian musi-
cal score was created through
the collaberation of Coleman
and ‘ resident composer
Christine Frezza. Frezza had

Shakespeare's   singers  
Festival director takes unusual approach  

identity,/ love and fidelity to
move the plot. The punctuat-
ed rhythms of the Gilbert and
Sullivan style add to the witty
wordplay of Shakespeare.
Where Shakespeare's verse

If Shakespeare had
been alive at the
turn of the century,
I’m sure he would
have sent the script
to Gilbert & Sullivan.
— W. Stephen Coleman

- the difficulttask of being both
Gilbert and Sullivan as well as
the instrument of Coleman's
vision. ‘ ’

For Frezza, Two Gentlemen
is full of life and humor. ”Two
Gentlemen naturally lends it-
self to the Gilbert and Sullivan
style operetta,” she said.

The script itself uses the

timeless elements of mistaken

doesn't ‘fit, Frezza’s does.

Combined, these artists of old 4

and of new create a theater ex-
perience unique to the 1987

Three Rivers‘ Shakespeare.

Festival.
G Coleman, is convinced he
' has taken the right approach to
the script. The highly emotion-
alized melodramatic situations
that Shakespeare resolved in
the blink of an eye make sense

4-.“

in the context of a light,
frivolous musical.

”_lf Shakespeare had been
alive at the turn of the centu-
ry, I’m sure he would have

sent the script to Gilbert and

Sullivan to use as a libretto. I
really searched for the right

way into this play — an access '
that would clarify its unique"

way of .revealing Shake-.
speare's insight on fickle love,
and most importantly, the rela-
tionship between love and
friendship," said Coleman.
While the production moves

_ forward several centuries to

make better sense of the script,
the setting remains in the Vic-
torian Age. Scenery and
properties designer Henry
Heymann uses the theme of
toy theatre —— all properties
and scenery are one dimen-
sional, just .as those in the
miniature toy theaters used by
children in the time of King
Edward.

  Smartfood?

Unveiling the secret confessions of a junk-food editor

One of the advantages of being
an editor of this paper is that oc-
casionally I receive some rather
interesting, but for the most part,
useless mail.

I often get enlightening litera-
ture such as ”Political Implica-
tions of Teng Hsiao-ping’s
Military Rectification” by Yu Yu-
lin. Believe me, I was going to
read it, but there was this bar 

Anyway, about four weeks ago
I received a big box from a com-
pany called Smartfoods, Inc., the
manufacturer of Smartfood Pop-
corn ’n Cheese. I never receive
boxes in the mail, so this couldn't

be all that bad. And I like pop— ,

corn, so the product was useful.
However, it was rather peculiar.
Why? _

Well, as I quickly opened one
of the six 4-ounce bags, what im-
mediately caught my eye was that
this cheddar cheese popcorn has
a curious similarity to’ regular
popcorn — it's white.

I couldn't understand why this

cheesy popcorn was white until-

I picked up the promotional
material the company sent to me

and read that Smartfood Popcorn. -

’n Cheese ”is made from special
hybrid Kentucky corn kernels
which are air-popped and coated
with natural, white cheddar
cheese powder.” .

Gee, I guess I should have
known.

Smartfoods president Ken Mey-  
ers, who is only 28, said the

reconstruct my roommates furni-
ture out on the lawn, start a few
water fights and still finish my
paper ...”

0 ”My parakeet loves itI”

0 ”This is not only the best
snack food, not only the best pop—
corn, but the best damn food to
come down the pike in many a
moon!”

And my favorite 

0 ”Productivity is up 20 per-
cent, and worker satisfaction has
increased by 100 percent since

- Smartfood appeared in our snack

shop.” 4
Obviously, the advertising

white powder is part of the  '

product's special appeal. ”The
white powder is a value. People
want a product that tastes really
good but isn't made with cheese
flavor enhancers. It's something
different. People want a white
cheeseproduct,” said Meyers.

But the natural flavor of the '
' popcorn is Smartfoods’ big sell-

ing point, according to Meyers.
”It’s a natural cheesepopcorn
that doesn't make you feel sick af-
ter eating half the bag. The pow-
der gives us a real good quality
product,” he said.

Indeed,_ all my friends enjoyed
the popcorn, but I was more int-
rigued by the literature that was
sent along with the popcorn.
Here are some samplesof what
fans of the popcorn had to say:

0 ”I first tried Smartfood while
working late one night,” said
James Harvey, a sophomore at
the. University of Massachusetts.
’’It gave me enough energy to

although there actually was a
Smartfoodfan in Rhode Island
who wrote Meyers a marriage
proposal.

”I guess our philosophy was
that not coming out of a business
background, we're doing what
we would like to do. When I was
a_ reporter, I remember all the shit
I used to get in the mail. We
thought we would send out

"something a- little different to

make people laugh. If you make
people laugh, they'll remember
you,” said Meyers, who graduat-
ed from the University of Con-
necticut with a degree in
journalism. /'
In the literature, there is also a
list of the company's milestones.
Take this one for example — Sep-
tember, 1986, ”Company gets its
own I8-wheeler painted to look
like the bag,” or December,
1986, ”BiIIionth kernel popped

campaign is light-hearted,‘

JOHN
ENRIGI-I'I'

and was sent out to be bronzed.”

The bag itself is an interesting
gimmick employed by the com-
pany. Smartfood comes in a dark
black bag which is very unusual.
The bag has a picture of popcorn
popping out of an ear of corn
painted, of course, in yellow. The
bag says things like, ”Famous
Since 1985," ”600,000,000 ker-
nels popped” and ”The Ultimate
Taste Bud Sensation.”

Said Meyers, ”The object was

 to put the product in an outra-

geous package and generate in-
terest among people that might
not be predisposed themselves to
pass it up. We wanted to give
people a surprise.”

But, let's get back to how this
whole thing started in the first

place. The company has been in ’

operation since October, 1984
and was the idea of three people
— co-founders Meyers and An-
drew and Ann Martin. Meyers ex-
plains, ”Me and another guy
[Martin] were working for
another manufacturer in a pack-
aging industry for a couple of

years, and we had been in and —

around the snack food industry.

”We had this idea to come up
with our own snack. We picked
popcorn because it's coming into
its own, and it's natural, and it's
been virtually ignored by the
snack food industry. Popcorn’ is
also the cheapest snack to get
intoin terms of the equipment.”

Meyers is quick to add that this
wasn't all some crazy off-the-wall
idea that turned into a surprising
and sudden success. ”The deci-
sion to get into the popcorn in-
dustry was pragmatic _and logical.
It wasn't likerwe spilledsome
cheese on some popcorn in the

kitchen and came up with this.

We knew what we wanted, and
we found it." -
From there it just took a lot of
hard work and a steady diet of
taste-testing cheese popcorn to

come up with the right product

—-the one that would sell big in
the supermarkets. I . ’

”The recipe was created in the
kitchen. [Ann] did most of the

ground work,” said Meyers. "We .
got the different cheese flavors ‘

from manufacturers and Ann got
it down to about six [flavors]. We

all tried them and made the de-

The cheesy popcorn sells in '13
states and, get this, Bermuda.
Meyers said the popcorn is mak-
ing progress in eastern Pennsyl-
vania and Maryland. For now,
though, the company does its
best sales in New York, NewJer-
sey and New England (which
isn't surprising because Smart-
foods, Inc. is located outside of
Boston in Marlborough, Mass.).

Meyers said Smartfoods, Inc., 4

To many it would seem Smart-

foods’ success has come rather

abruptly, but Meyers insists it had

to be that way. ”We’re very ag-'

gressive in our planning. We had
to be to raise cash from private in-
vestors. We're trying to l_ive up to
the promises we made to those
investors. If we had set our goals
lower we probably wouldn't
have reached them,” he said.

Local fuzz-fanatics, The Cynics, have been getting quite a response

have a little more ‘soul — Neil Young will join the boys for some
of the gigs left of the Rockies. Zevon, Mills, Buck, Berry and Young
— kinda has a ring to it ... Throwing Muses has been signed by Sire
Records. It's pretty sad that an American band has to have two smash
records on a British label before an American label will stand up and
take notice.  Along the same lines, another Boston-based band, Skin,
will be releasing their second single. ”Troubled Sleep” will be the
follow-up to ”1,000 Years.” My question is, where the heck is the
album (Blood, Women, Roses) that was supposed to be out weeks
ago?  Looks like The Grateful Dead will be back in Pittsburgh on
July 6. Tickets go on sale June 1. ... Be sure to check out Johnny
Rhythm and the Dimestore 45s tonight at The Electric Banana. It will
be their first area appearance, so let's show them we care. It's a dirty
job, but someone’s got to do it. 

The Wailers return without Marley

By Karen Michele Gardner
Staff Writer

‘When a band member dies, it's

always difficult for a group to «

continue. With The Wailers, it
was almost impossible.

Bob Marley was The Wailers.
He is credited with making reg-
gae the music form it is today. He
was as much to, reggae as Elvis
and The Beatles were to rock ‘n’
roll.

But on May _11, 1981

 .tb.e...

36-year-old Marley died from a
brain tumor, and his dream of
spreading the word of Jah
Rastafari died with him. ‘

The band has since reformed to
carry on Marley's legacy and will
be appearing for two shows at
Grafitti this Friday.

In 1972, The Wailers recorded
their first LP, Catch A Fire, fol.-
lowed by Burnin’, an album
which included ’’I Shot The
Sheriff,” a song Eric Clapton later
took to No. 1. 8 '

R.E.M. succumbs to video mania Zbyﬁta

 

Throughout the rest of the '70s,
Bob Marley and The Wailers be-

came the most significant band in -

reggae’s short history.

Uprising, Marley's last album,
hit every chart in Europe. The
Wailers finished a European tour
and came to New York, where
Marley was diagnosed as having
cancer-

He fought the disease for eight
months before he died in a Mia-
mi hospital in 1981.

Jerome Lane seems to be full
of surprises lately.

As a sophomore this past
season and, more precisely, as

than lively freshman season,
Lane took college basketball
by storm, taking every team he
played against on the glass.
But that wasn't enough. He
did this so often that by the
end of the season he was the
leading rebounder in the
nation.

Now itseems he's trying to
add a little altruism to his
game. ~

In the recent tryouts for the
U.S. team which will compete
in the Pan American games in

member Lane said he
seemed concerned not only

i . for his own fate with the
judges but -for the other candi-
dates as well.

"There was too much talent
there to fill a 12-man roster,”
said Lane. "There were so
many good people trying out
that I really felt bad for the
ones who didn't make it. But,
they just went with who they
needed, and as a rebounder I
was one of the specialists they
needed.” ' _

And Lane iscontinuing to

New Man  

one who had a somewhat less -

August — of which Lane is a.

And I'm not saying they are
‘ going to be great just for me,

Lanechanges mood  
before the PanAms  

nurture his prime talent on the
boards. ,

''I look at it this way,” said
Lane. "Rebounding is what I
can do the best. During the
tryouts, I had my hand on ev- '
ery [rebound] that came my
way. Now I can play well at
other spots, but if I'm under
the hoop, I try my best to hook
onto the ball. I think the judges
realized this, and as a
specialist in that capacity, I
think that is really what helped
me in gaining the spot.”

Looking back on the past
season, Lane said he is more
than happy with this chance to
continue during the off-
season. But, because the past
season was so good, Lane bas-
ic‘ally feels anything else
which comes along is icing on
the cake. '

"The Pan American games
are"rea|ly going to be a boost
for me," said Lane, "especial-
ly coming off of last season.‘

but for me as a member of the
Pitt Panther. team as well.
That's something I take a lot of
pride in now. ‘
''I mean, last year I really
can't say I feltmuch of any-
thing — I really came in with
a bad attitude, and the season
(1985-86) really didn't help

Pitt Sports Information Director
Jim O'Brien will be assuming a
new post on Aug. 1.

O'Brien, 44, has been named
the assistant director for Univer-
sity Outreach Programs at the
University of Pittsburgh.

O'Brien is curently completing
his fourth year as assistant athlet-
ic director for public relations and
sports information director.

O'Brien was originally invited
back to Pitt, his alma mater, in

' 1983 by Athletic Director Dr. Ed-

ward Bozik. He left the sports
department of The Pittsburgh
Press, where he reported prin-
cipally on the Pittsburgh Steelers.’

''I am very pleased that Jim has
the opportunity to make this
career move that affords him the
potential for new professional de-
velopment,” said Bozik. "I ap-
preciatevery much the service
Jim has provided to our athletics
department over the past four
years and am particuarly pleased
that his talents are being retained
within the ‘university. Jim is an en-
thusiastic, creative person who

loves the university, and. I am _

\

 

a very real gneed.'T,here is-a;s_tate-

Jim O'Brien

confident he will do an excellent
job in the admissions area.”
O'Brien will now be a member
of the staff of the Office of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid. The dir-
ector of that office is Dr. Betsy A.

Porter.

"We're eagerly looking for-
ward ‘to Jim joining our office
staff,”.said Dr. Porter. "Given his
experience. in: so many commu-
ni'cation.a‘reas, he is going-.to,fill

‘. 

wide objective to increase the

percentage of high school stu— _

dents who go on to higher edu-

cation, and Jim is going to
represent Pitt's part in that
program. ' ' -

A "He will be a goodsalesman
for Pitt.” _

And O'Brien said he is looking
forward to his new assignment.

”During the past four years,”
said O'Brien, "I saw my role as
promoting the University of Pitts-
burgh through its athletic pro-
grams, and now I will have the
opportunity to promote Pitt
through’ all of its programs. I look
upon this as a
enhancement move, and I am ex-

' cited by this new challenge.'’

But O'Brien also feels this

move will help him become in-

‘volved with the onelfacet of the
university community with which
he thought he would never have
any business -— the students.

"This will also give me a
chance to do more of the things
I really enjoy doing, and working
closer with students, and to help
the Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid in its efforts to at-
tractand recruit more and better

~s_tudents,'_to our school," he said-

"I believe strongly in Pitt and take
great pride in my association with

great opportunity it provides peo-
ple tp further their education and
to grow as individuals in the best
possible environment.

"I find the university has an I

amazing energy and vitality that
I never thought possible,” he
continued. "What I want to do

now-is lead kids who come to _

Pitt. This is a great school, and I

think more people:in_..the univer-

mote just how great it is."

O'Brien has already been the».
architect of a field-trip program
for local schoolchildren‘ -— as
project in which he takes great-f
pride —— and plans now to further 

this through his new position.
"A friend of mine calls me the

Staff Writer

. ’ The Pitt track team concluded

its season with a third-place fin-
ish in the recently completed
IC4A competition held this past
weekend at Villanova University.

World-class Pitt sprinter Lee
McRae set a meet record in the
100-meter race with a time of
10.2.

Dave Moore finished second in

 

the 800-meter competition with
a time of 1:49.29. Senior Tim
Moore, recovering from an ab-
cessed cyst on his appendix,
finished fifth in the event with a
time of 1250.4.

plish more than we did in the
4x100, but a bad start hampered
our performance in the event,”
said Cannon.

According to Manes, the team
has much to be proud of. ”Con-
sidering the fact that this is the
best Pitt team since the 1937 one,
which featured Olympian runner
John Woodruff, it's obvious the
improvement the team has made
under coaches [John] Vasvary
and [Steve Lewis],” Manes said.

But the performance at the
|C4As was not the most intrigu-
ing moment of the season, ac-
cording to Manes.

”When we trailed St. John's by

_ 65 points after the first day of
competition, just about everyone
had written us off,” Manes said.
” But after we came back to lose
by just 2 points, I think we gained
more respect in our coming so

What's in the future for the

plishment was knowing that I
could make others around me
better athletes.”

Of course, very few track teams
can function without the advice
of a knowledgeable coach.

”Coach Vasvary took a group
of misfits and made them nation-
al contenders,” Manes said. He

also noted that coaches Vasvary’

and Lewis have molded a team
lacking in superstar potential and
instilled in them a solid work
ethic.

But perhaps the best analogy
came from Eric Cannon, who
compared the Pitt track team to
the defending Super Bowl cham-
pions, the New York Giants.
”The Giants had all the talent; it
was just a matter of all of the play-
ers pulling together,” Cannon
said. ‘

One would be hard pressed to
argue with that statement.

Gonzalezfirst to got

* By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt sophomore Jorge Gonzalez
is the first male gymnast in the
university's history to qualify for
the prestigious USA champion-
ship meet to be held in Kansas
City, June 18-20.

The meet will showcase the
United States’ top 72 gymnasts.
A lot will be riding on the meet
for these athletes, as their perfor-
mances will determine whether
they will make the U.S. team, the
World Championship team and,
eventually, the Pan—Am team.

Pitt men's gymnastic coach
Frank D’Amico does not expect
Gonzalez to score well enough to

-qualify for any of the national

teams. i

That does not mean that Gon-
zalez does not have a purpose in
competing in the meet.

”I want Jorge to leave the meet
with a positive attitude and some-
thing to_buiId on for next year,”
said D’Amico. ”I’m really thrilled

that he has achieved this honor I

so early in his career.”
Gonzalez is in agreement with
his coach. He knows it is un-
realistic to hope for a qualifying
finishin his first USA champion-
ship competition. He has set his
sights more realistically in hoping

for a good performance and a top _

50 finish.
’’I’m not expecting to place

really well,” said Gonzalez, ”I—

want to perform as well as I can,
though, and establish a name for
myself when I return next year.

”Sure, someday I hope to place

in the top 18 or 10 and make a9

national team,” he continued.
”But I realize that it isn't going to

come all at once. It's a building
process. You have to get started
somewhere.”

There are four regional qualify-
ing meets throughout the year
that gymnasts can compete in to
qualify for the USA Champi-
onships.

Gonzalez competed in the last
qualifying meet of the year, held
recently at Ohio State, and was
surprised when he learned that
he had qualified. I

’’I was happy with the way my

.routines went during the pre-

qualifying meet,” said Gonzalez,
”But I never thought that I was
good enough to make it.”

Gonzalez does not fit the
stereotypical mold that most male
gymnasts fit into.

Most male gymnasts range in
height from 5'0" to 5'4”. Gonza-
lez, however is 5'9” and more
muscular than the average
gymnasts.

His height in many cases could
be considered a disadvantage.

”Gonzalez is very muscular
and quite big for a gymnast,” said
D’Amico. ”He has to be more
atuned and train harder as a
result.

Gonzalez feels that he has
learned to work well with his
body frame.

”My height and size could be

a disadvantage at times if I wasn't

as strong and flexible,” said Gon-

zalez. ”You learn how to com-.

pensate. Since I’m larger, _there’s
more weight to pull around,
therefore, I have to compensate
for that by being stronger.”

In addition to being strong
physically, Gonzalez states that
being strong mentally is just as
important.

 

 

Panther gymnast ]'orge Gonzalez is the first ever to make the U.S.

”If I do well [at the champion-
ships] this year, hopefully we will
be able to qualify more people

"next year,” continued Gonzalez.
‘ ”The more people we get into the

USA Championships and the
more recognized they become
on the national level,‘ the better
the team and university willlook.
I think it will really boostthe sport
here at Pitt.” ' ’

Unser surprises even self by winning Indy

By Mike Harris

AP Motorsports Writer

INDIANAPOLIS — Albert Uns-
er, 4, stood on the main straight-
away at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway and -ran his hands
slowly over the huge trophy that
goes to the winner of the Indi-
anapolis 500.

Al Unser, his grandfather, has
his likeness on that trophy four
times after winning Sunday. The
youngster’s great uncle, Bobby, is
on the trophy three times.

. Albert's father, Al Unser Jr.,
finished fourth Sunday and seems
alikely candidate to add to the
Unser lore at the historic
speedway. ‘

and, perhaps, ”Mini Al” some-
thing more to shoot at by joining
A.J. Foyt as a four-time Indy
winner.

The elder Unser, who will be
48 Friday, also became the oldest
driver to win Indy, supplanting
Bobby, who was nine months
younger when he won his third
500 in 1981._

Needless to say, racing is an
Unser heritage.

Al Sr. and Bobby's father and
two uncles were race drivers, and
Uncle Louis practically owned
the Pike's Peak Hill Climb.

Jerry,‘the oldest of the three
Unser brothers, was said to
posess perhaps the most skill of
the three, but was killed in an ac-

Little Al began wheeling stock
cars around a field near the fami-

before he had a driver's license.
He wasat Indianapolis as a con-

Since then, the 25-year-old has

championship in last year's Inter-

several sports car endurance
events, including the Daytona

They don't take chances, either.”

Al Sr. admits he gets nervous

Greg Pavlick, the Mets’ roving
minor-league pitching coach who
is overseeing.Gooden’s return to
the majors. .

Gooden, 22, is expected to
make one more start in the

minors, for Tidewater at Maine

liked it.”

”|’ve never seen such a story-
book ending,” said Bobby Uns-
er, who had to fight back tears
while serving as a color commen-
tator for ABC's coverage of the
race. ”That’s fabulous, that's ab-
solutely fabulous. I can't believe
it. The Unser family now has a
four‘-time winner.”

Al Sr. doesn't admit to getting
emotional about Indy,- but it is
special.

”The Unser family has always
loved Indy,” he said. ”We’ve had
some real good times here and
some bad times. I had my brother
Jerry killed here. But he liked it.
He wanted to be here. It's a spe-
cial place.”

Gooden unimpressive in victory

‘on Sunday. That will be Goo-

den’s first outing in a road game.
The Mets are hoping Gooden

can make his first start in the big’

leagues on June 5, at home
against Pittsburgh.

While the Mets say they are not
worried by Gooden’s troubles, he
has not resembled an overpower-
ing pitcher in the minors. In his
last start Thursday night for
Tidewater, he gave up nine hits
in six innings in an 8-5 victory

me out much because we just
didn't have much of one. But

[with the way we all played
this year and now with the Pan
American games, I'm on track
and ready. for anything.

’’I’m a new Jerome, and I
think this is evident to anyone
who watches me. Being the
leading rebounder helped alot
to prove this, but I think it will
be more evident with what is
still to come, and I think the

' Pan American games are a

great start.” I

Lane said he knew many 0
the other players from around
the country who also tried out

for the team, ”at least over 50»

percent,” and is especially
happy about playing ‘with
those who actually made the

1 team. This includes Pooh
Richardson of UCLA, Jeff Lebo
of North Carolina, Danny
Manning of Kansas and Dean
Garrett and Keith Smart, both
of the NCAA champion Indi-
ana Hoosiers team. ’ '

V But it was one player whom
Lane turned tofor advice and,
consequently, got it -— team-
mate Charles Smith. ‘

”Charles was a big help to
me in the fact that he knew
what I would be up against
and therefore could give me
advice,” said, Lane.. ”He told
me to go out and do the same
thing that got me there in the
first place and not'to try and
score high or try to be too fan-
cy. And that's what I did. I

went out and tried my best as
a player.

But again, surprisingly,

ther than the here—and-now.
’’I figure it this way,” he
said. ”If.l do well this summer,
it will only help during the up-
_ coming season.
Oh well, a‘ little altruism .
never hurt anybody. f _ '
