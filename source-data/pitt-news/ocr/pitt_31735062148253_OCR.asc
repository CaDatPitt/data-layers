Give New Drill

Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military
fraternity, will demonstrate the
new infantry close-order drill pre-
ceding the Pitt-Nebraska football
game in the Stadium tomorrow,
announces G.,R. Frankovich, C41,
president. - '

For the third consecutive year
Pitt Riﬂes has been selected to
demonstrate various army ma-
neuvers. The Rifles. drilled at the
Fordham game last year, and at
the Nebraska contest, two years
ago’-. " " 

Tomorrow will be the first time
that this infantry drill,-~~.-recently
adopted by all armed forces of
the’ United States, will be publicly

‘ shown in‘ this section. Tentative
plans call for the Riﬂes to parade
into the Stadium behind the Pitt
Band, and to stand at present arms
during the ﬂag raising ceremony.

Tomorrow’s drill group will be
composed of approximately 60 ac-
tive members and a select number
from the 140 candidates for this
organization. They will be divided
into three platoons with the fol-
lowing ROTC students in com-
mand:' lst, Paul Vissat, E41; 2nd,

F reshinen Hold

‘Pilgrim Prance’

This year’s freshman dance will
be held in the largest ballroom
between Chicago and New York.

So declares Bob Sullivan, C43,
chairman of the “Pi1grim’s'Prance”
scheduled to take place Wednes-
day evening in the Syria Mosque.

Bringing to campus Johnny Long
and his orchestra, the first year men
and women are now selling tickets
priced at $2 a couple for the in-
formal dance.

A ﬂoor show will highlight the
evening’s entertainment, promises
Sullivan. Business manager of the
affair is Charles Cusick, BA. John
Creps, BA was chosen as publicity
director.

Thirty-three freshman make up
the entire committee.

University Patterns Conference
Room After Damascus Library

What was once a library in the
palace of a weathy Syrian in Damas-
cus will be erected as the Syrian-
Lebanon conference room on the first
floor of the Cathedral. _ V

This sixteenth century" symbol of
the ‘best in Arabian art is the only
original room in the Cathedral, de-
clares Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitch-
ell, adviser to the nationality rooms.

The decorative ceiling is already
placed to avoid damage, and the Sy-
rian-Lebanon committee has made
plans to erect the walnut—panelled
walls in the near future. Walls fea-
ture raised designs in plaster or
“gesso” work painted in gold and
silver along with red, green, yellow,
and blue.

Only four such rooms are saidyto
be in existence aside from a few in
old palaces. This library, which
the committee purchased from the
Vester galleries in New York, is the
only one in this country. When the
ancient city of Damascus was mod-
ernized, old palaces were razed in

Order to build a highway, but these
rooms were preserved, Mrs. Mitchell
reveals.

At one side of the room is a pray-
er niche, shaped like a door of a
mosque which is supposed to have
been used as a shrine by a Mussul-
man for prayer. The large doors on
cupboards or bookcases are adorned
with archotectural motifs showing
curved domes, terraced gardens, and
cypress trees.

Entrances to the conference room
will lead from the information room
and also from the alcove near the
Russian Room.

Thanksgiving Recess

No University classes will be held
during the Thanksgiving recess
which will extend from 4:30 o’clock
Wednesday, November 22, until
Saturday, November 24.

Ofﬁces will be closed on Thanks-
giving but will be open on Friday
and Saturday.

“The Interclass Sing cup is still as
shiny as ever; but who is going to win
the prize for the class which raises
the most money in proportion to its
size?” queries Miss Nydes. “Will
some class win both theprizes which
are to be presented "at the Interclass
Sing?” 0 A ' " ‘

the office of the dean of women has
arranged that any girl who has not

tribute, or, for some reason failed to
do so, may leave her money at the
ofﬁce in 1201 Cathedral and sign the
list for her class.

Miss Nydes reveals that the cam-

paign has been so effective that even
‘a man has contributed to the cam-

paign. Fifty-ﬂve cents, a penny for
every birthday that he has_ had, will
be credited to the faculty contribution

Parents See the University
And Receive Grade Cards

This evening freshman men and women will sit at home while
their parents visit the University. Fathers and mothers of the class
of 1943 may step softly through the inspiring beauty of the Commons
Room, and note the richly-decorated nationalities rooms.

They will enjoy the singing of the Glee Club, and be impressed
by the Chancellor’s talk on the ideals of education. This evening’s
reception will be the University ’s welcome to the people who help to
make it possible.

Parents of the freshmen will also receive grade cards, indicat-
ing the relative progress of their sons and daughters during the
first eight weeks of the University year. VVe suggest that neither
parents nor freshmen become excited or dep§essed~ at the marks on
these cards. Grades, while regarded as a necessary index of prog-
ress in courses, can never serve as the ﬁnal indicators of the success
of a student ’s education. ’

Behind the sincere w_elc,ome extended by the University, to-
night’s reception will afford parents an opportunity to meet teachers
and discuss the conditions which will allow their children to do
their best work. How well the freshman ‘takes advantage of _his
ability is the real mark of his success in the University.

Yourlillulmor Magazine
Goes Defective   

"  ,'Rumor,s rea.ching.the Pitt News office during the past weekni-
dicate that; there is considerable doubt on campus as to whether Bob
G-estrich,.1BA41, actually ‘did write a book entitled “We, the Civil-
ized.” These rumors receivedi:”ad.dit‘ional conﬁrmation when the
Pitt Panther, ‘,‘ humor” magazine, advertised an expose of the
“year ’-s biggest calnpus hoax” in its publicity for this month’s issue.

Because the truth of the information which Gestrich had given -

the News last, month wasin doubt, the News obtained from-him the
stat’e1nent: appearing in the story onlpage one, in which he emphatical-

l,v"is'tat'_es,th‘at_ he did‘ write the book, and that he did receive $1,500 

for it.  M p
So the Panther exposes the year ’s biggest campuisiphoax, and
that hoax’-happens to involve ‘Bob: Gestrich, the Pantherﬂvill .. be

exposing the complete unreliability of a member of its owneditorial. ‘

board. .

The News wouldn’t' suspect for a. moment that Bob didn’t
write “Vi-'e, the Civilizec,” especially after receiving his renewed
assurances that it is being published. We believe that he, as a

University student, values his personal int.egrity,highly enough to i
preclude any possibilityvthat he would make a false statement for ,

publication to the students and faculty of the University. '
The,__implicati.ons of this situatigon make us agree more than ever
with Jack Hoeveler, business manager of the magazine, when he says,

‘-‘There-_is~a?place3on the campus for a publication like the 'Panther.” —_

I mlcstigotion by Dr. ‘Held Shows

I ncrcose inNllmher of Students

By Georgia Shuset

“What chance does my son or
daughter have of succeeding in his
college work?” is the question con-
fronting the parents of every college
student today.

Approximately 34 per cent of those
entering as freshmen will probably
graduate, according to a study by H.
A. Edgerton and H. A. Toops, authors
of “Academic Progress,” at Ohio
State University. Recent investiga-
tions have proved that the rate of
student mortality, the failure of stu-
dent to remain in college until grad-
uation, in _ihe_I1p.Ijth,,.is’lower -than that

after leaving the university; those
who return at a later date to continue
their work after leaving the univer-
sity; and those who discontinue their
higher education upon leaving the
university.

Higher percentages’ of men than
women are dismissed for failure in
work, the study shows. This is true
of almost every coeducational univer-
sity. Financial difﬁculties, death and
sickness, “needed at home,” and lack
of interest are other causes of student
mortality.

The results of Dr. Held’s study
should warrant the statement that, as
a group, students who commute suc-
ceed equally as well as those living in
the vicinity of the University. » Also
that the amount of ﬁnancial support
received by students during their
freshmanyear affects their success in
academic work very little.

AN OPEN “AD” TO THE SPORTS
STAFF:

What kind of a runaround are you giv-
ing us? Jaffe picks them wrong Fridays,
makes excuses Mondays. When he DOES
pick 7 out of 8, what happens? He
doesn’t turn in the story. And then to
make matters worse, he Dicks Tech over
Pitt, sacriﬁcing his Alma Mater for his
prediction. (Joke! Elaine: I think the
sacriﬁce was poor Bertram.)

I pick them right every week. My bat-
ting average is 1000. The only trouble is
I DON'T hand them in, either. Elaine.

ALREADY, AN ANSWER!

Dearest Elaine: Your above ad grieves me
deeply. With apologies to you and other
loyal Pitt followers, I sincerely believed
Tech had the stronger team BEFORE the
game. However, the Pitt boys had too
much fight and spirit plus good sound foot-
ball last Saturday for the Skibos to handle.
(Mr. Bowser had something to do with this
prediction, we bet, or else J. would have
landed in a lake, if we had a lake.) -

If your average is 1000 will you be will-
lug to turn in your prediction on the same
games I have selected. I will be glad to
take your selection at the News-, office; at
1:30 on Friday and I will put up one cent
for each game we disagree on. ,‘B'e‘rt_ Jfiaﬁé.

Battered Panther Team
Minus Five Regulars
In Fourteenth Renewal

The anti-climax of the 1939 Pitt‘

football season will be reached to-
morrow and next Saturday. 1

At the outset of the season, the
so-called experts said that the
Panthershrould be lucky to win

two games, but with two games yet to
go, the blue and gold gridders have
chalked up ﬁve victories against two
defeats.

‘Rivalry Dates to 1921

Tomorrow, the Panthers ‘will be out
to -keep up Pitt’s nearly clean slate
against the Cornhuskers. The two
teams ﬁrst met on the gridiron in
1921, and the gentlemen from the
mid-west were victorious, 10-0.

‘Since that time the Cornhuskers
have been unable to win a_ single
game from the Panthers in 12 battles,
dropping nine decisions and playing
three scorelessties. _

To date, the boys from the western
side of the Mississippi have dropped
but one game and tied one in seven
games. The lone defeat was admin-
istered by Paul Christman and the
University of Missouri, Pitt’s opening
foe for next year.

Host of Good Husker Backs

It is extremely difﬁcult to pick out
one man as the star of the Nebraska
attack. Pitt “assistant coach Arnold
Greene, who has been scouting the
Cornhuskers all year, is high in his
praises of Herman “Roaring” Roh-
rig, Harry “.I-Iippity” Hopp, and Bob
Luther in the Nebraska backﬁeld.

The Cornhuskers’ squad contains
three sets of‘ brothers. Included in
the brother acts are Ed and Sam
Schwartzkopf, -regular guard 2: and
tackle on the starting line. The other
two sets,_of brotherstare Royal ; and
Robert Kahler,‘ a tackle and half, and

Five Pitt Regulars Out

Pitt’s starting lineup will contain
quite a few new faces. Fans may
be assured the boysgare not" wearing
masks for deceptive purposes; they
are decorated with plaster-of-paris
casts. '

Jack Goodridge has replaced John-
ny Dickinson at right end and will
team up with Joe Rettinger at the
ﬂanks. “Tiger Jack” Benz, new Pitt
News reporter, is subbing for the in-
jured Konetsky at right tackle and
his running mate is the old reliable
Frank Kristufek. For the third con-
secutive week, Gradisek, Hawkins,
and Klein form the center of the line.

This was decided at the second meeting of the assembly of SFA

The banquet‘ room of Soldiers

will cost approximately $1 per

the executive committee was empow-

event. .

It was agreed that Monday night
was the most logical night to hold the
banquet, since fraternities would
probably cancel their dinners that

Thursday, November 30, has

ANY-a smoker has switched to Camels because his value-sense,
M applauded the thrift of getting more putts per pack. But . . .
that’s only one small part of the story of slow burning. You get a
lot more than savings! You get extra mildness! Common’ sense tells ‘ 2 ’  
you that a fast, ﬁery, hot-burning cigarette will not smoke comfort- 
ably or yield a delicate taste and fragrance. And that slow-burning
tobaccos naturally would be mild and mellow. You get extra cooI- A ,
ness. You needn’t be a scientist to knoyv that the slower tobacco 1 5 ‘ t  .
burns, the cooler the. smoking. You get extrwﬁne ﬂavor. Excess heat ‘ it ’
ruthlessly destroys the subtle elements of ﬂavor and aroma. Slow-
burning Camels tell their own taste—tale! So . . . for thrift and
a smoking thrill . . . light UP i flow-burning Camel!
