MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers
earn first
Big East

  victory

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team
earned its ﬁrst Big East and road
victory of the season in impressive
fashion on Tuesday night.

With an 0-3 start to conference
play for the second consecutive
season staring the Panthers (13-
3, 1-2 Big East) in the face, Pitt
produced its best performance
of the season and defeated No. 19
Georgetown (10—3, 0-2 Big East) at
the Verizon Center in Washington,
D;C., by a score of 73-45.

It was clear from the very begin-
ning that the game would be a Big
East defensive slugfest. Both teams
turned the ball over on their ﬁrst
possession, and Georgetown held
a narrow 2-0 lead three minutes
into the game after Pitt missed its
ﬁrst four shots.

The Panthers scored the next
seven points, though, thanks to a
jumper by senior point guard Tray
Woodall, a dunk by freshman cen-
ter Steven Adams and a 3-pointer
by redshirt junior forward Lamar
Patterson.

After Georgetown responded
with its second bucket, Pitt went on
another 7-0 run, which culminated
with a layup by redshirt sopho-
more guard Cameron Wright.

The away team’s momentum
continued with a three—point"play
by senior forward Dante Taylor as
the Panthers opened up a 17-6 lead

Seeping in with the cold, it crosses

quickly and frequently.

Seasonal inﬂuenza is a highly
contagious respiratory disease
induced by a virus. Often, it just
knocks you out for a week as you
snuffle through a box of tissues and
sip on soup. But if the virus ﬁnds
the perfect combination of factors,
it can kill hundreds of thousands
of people.

Now, Shanta Zimmer from Pitt’s
Internal Medicine department
and Johns Hopkins’ Derek Cum-

school-aged children inﬂuence the
transmission of the disease and
how school closings could halt its

Propel Schools and the Canon-

also used to understand how the
children interacted.

Students should take rap group Cypress
Hill’s advice and “put the blunt down, just
for a second” because smoking marijuana
is still illegal in Pennsylvania.

But advocates of marijuana legaliza-
tion in Pittsburgh say Pennsylvania might
soon follow the lead of Washington and
Colorado, two states that passed refer-
enda legalizing marijuana for recreational
use in November.

The law took effect in Colorado this
past Saturday. The official legalization in
Colorado follows roughly one month after
Washington celebrated “Legalization
Day” as the state law became effective
there on Dec. 6.

juliajohnson, president of Pitt’s chap-
ter of the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws, believes that
a similar ballot has the potential to be

passed in Pennsylvania within the life-
times of current students.

“We’re hoping for a domino effect,”
she said.

Although Colorado and Washington
are among 18 other states with approved
marijuana for medical purposes, these
two states are‘ the ﬁrst to legalize the drug
speciﬁcally for recreational purposes.
People are still unable to smoke in public

. in these states, but those 21 years and
older will have the ability to retain up to
an ounce of marijuana. ’

While the Obama administration
weighs whether or not to take legal ac-
tion against states that have legalized

,, marijuana use because it is still illegal
under federal law, a YouGov poll released
in December indicated that a small frac-
tion of adults believe that the federal
government should not enforce federal

’ laws in those states.

MARIJUANA

Despite the protests from legalization
activists such as Johnson, legislation loos-
ening regulation on marijuana in Penn-
sylvania has received little enthusiasm
among members of Pennsylvania’s state
legislature.

There have been at least two bills pre-
sented to the Pennsylvania legislature
regarding medical marijuana in the past

. several years.

‘V The first bill, known as HB1393, was
introducedby Rep. Mark Cohen, D:Ph.il'4

‘ adelphia, on April 3O,‘2I0O9l,l‘i”n'the' State»

house. On May 4, 2010, Sen. Daylin Leach,
D—Montgomery, introduced the compan-
ion state Senate bill, number SB1350.

But these bills did not pass.

There are currently no legalization
bills<.in»Pennsylvania, and Johnson pre-
dictsfthat no new bill will be introduced in
the immediate future, as Gov. Tom Corbett
has?publicly declared his opposition to

marijuana legislation.

Janet Kelley, deputy director of com-
munications for the governor, said Cor-
bett does not believe that loosening re-
strictions on illegal drugs is in the interest
of public safety.

f5G»QV.’TOn1 Corbett has personally wit-
nekslsedthiedevastation of illegal drugs on
Pennsylvania communities throughout
his career,” she said.

Though the governor has taken a hard
stance on the issue, proponents of mari-
juana legalization at Pitt continue to argue
on behalf of the potential benefits legal-
ization could have for campus.

Michael Arkwright, Pitt NORML’s
business manager, said he believes that

the legalization of medical marijuana in _

Pennsylvania would result in at least one
positive effect on Pitt’s campus.
“Imagine our campus without Pitt po-

, lice chasing down stoners, and instead,

using those resources to crack down on
violent crimes among students,” he said.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele disagreed
with Arkwright’s argument.

“[Pitt police’s] enforcement of illicit
drug laws does not compromise its ability
to combat violent crime,” he said.

While Johnson said that she has hope
that all states will eventually legalize mar-
ijuana, Calvina Fay, executive director of
Drug Free America Foundation, said that
she does not believe that the United States
will ever institute such a law.

“The legalization of marijuana, for any
purpose, ﬂies in the face of any effo_rts to
prevent drug use, treat drug addiction
and apprehend dangerous drug dealers,”
she said. - I

ThoughJohnson recognizes the road to
marijuana legalization might be long, she
views the recent legalization referenda as
a major step down that path.

“We used to be laughed at,” she said
of legalization supporters. “But people
are starting to take the debatemore se-
riously.” '

Student Health Center provided ﬂu shots to

upwards of 2,400 ﬂu shots, according to Mar-
ian Vanek, director of student health services.

“We’re still quite active; students can still
get flu shots any day,” Vanek said.

Jacob Wilder, a junior at Pitt, is apprecia-

others to spend a few minutes to vaccinate
against the ﬂu.

”I’ve gotten one [shot] every year, and

Danny Zaidi
For The Pitt News

Americans continually debate
the direction society is heading
in. With tragedies fresh, cer-
tain questions burn brightly in
our minds: How do we prevent
more massacres, and what role
do guns actually play?

Americans wanted a good,
even discussion. A fair and bal-
ancedconversation about rights
and safety. A nuanced analysis
of mental health, guns, a vio-
lent entertainment industry and
legitimate cultural differences.

Sadly, we aren’t receiving the
discussion we deserve, and the
problems aren’t coming from
the over1y—blamed Tea Party or
the NRA.

It’s the liberal media, as usu-

a lack of guns.

Consider how little reporting
we witnessed last Christmas on
this story of a citizen using a gun
for safety.

According to a story in the
San Antonio Express—News, Je-
sus Manuel Garcia, 19, opened
ﬁre in the Chinese restaurant
where he was employed because
of difficulties with his girlfriend,
a fellow employee. He injured
one patron at the restaurant and
then moved on to a nearby movie
theater to continue the violence.

After entering the theater,
an off-duty officer chased and
brought down Garcia, an Ameri-
can citizen with a gun. Luckily no
one was killed; without a quick
response from this good samari-
tan, more than two would have
been wounded.

congress, restricted sales of

I stop any crime. Even the Cen-

ter for Disease Control, hardly
a pro-gun think tank, found “in—
sufﬁcient evidence to determine
the effectiveness of any ﬁrearms
law on violent outcomes.”

Ten years of gun restrictions
did nothing for our country..
They just infringed upon our
rights. And now, the powers at

ban them all together: honestly,

The most notable memberof
the liberal media is British news-

gutless rants areexemplar par

between news and opinion in the
wake of ‘a tragedy, with stern ad-
missions replacing knowledge-
able insight on gun control.

For instance, Morgan and
his cronies say nothing of how

ago, Morgan highlighted on his
show several shooting victims
from the past few decades. He
also brought on the president of
the NRA, whom he grilled with
questions regarding the efﬁcacy

who owns -a gun should be
trained to effectively use it in

San Antonio story, not the New-
town story, could be the story of
America.

But most importantly, rather
than focusing on the positive im-
pact guns can have, the media ig-
nores it. In addition to reducing
our Second Amendment rights,
laws restricting gun access have
done nothing to curb violence.

THE STAMATTACK

Bag of frozen peas distressed, forgotten as 2013 arrives

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opim'072s Edz'2fo_r

In the back of the freezer, one resident
just cannot chill out.

“I really believedjoe would have stuck
his hand back here by now. Something
about 2013 just felt good.”

Angsty and visibly motionless, the bag
of Green Giant Green Peas has good rea-
son to be worried.

Joe Williams, 24, of Pittsburgh, brought
the peas to the freezer in late 2010 after a
last—minute trade in place of a bag of Plain
Lay’s ripple potato chips. Since then, he
has made minimal efforts to incorporate
the classic vegetable into his diet. Despite
being purchased to satisfy a resolution to
“eat more healthy in 2011,” there has been
remarkably little motion as of yetin the
back of the freezer.  i‘

“We just haven’t found a place for them
in the rotation yet,” says Williams. “But
we are hopeful things will change soon.
I’m about to run out of ramen. We will
be carefully considering all our options,
but nothing is off the dining room table.”

“I really want to eat: more healthy in
2013,” he said. ,

The inaction strikes many observers
as odd. TheGreen P.eas show impressive
stats, having performed well for Williams
in the past: the richblend of various phy-
tonutrients and vitamins from a mashed
version he enjoyed as a child are respon-
sible for at least a small part of the im-
pressive 6-foot-2 stature he boasts today.

“I’ve proven what I can do. Give me
another chance,” plead the Peas.

Containing high levels of omega—6 fatty
acids, as well as abundant levels of vita-
min K, ferulic acid and caffeic acid, the
Peas’ potential benefits for Williams are
undeniable. Yet a preference for a rotat-
ing crop of Ben &Jerry’s and ground beef
at the front of the freezer seems to hold
precedence.

“I’m telling you. I’m going to eat more
healthy in 2o13,” repeats Williams when

questioned. “I’m just going to get rid of
some of this other stuff first.”

Despite the ireassurances, the current ‘I

state of extended limbo has been extract-
ing a severe emotional toll on the Peas.

“He took us out of the freezer last in
August 2011. I can’t tell you how excited
I was. A few minutes in, however, I real-
ized I wouldn’t be used to aid intestinal
motility to lower his cholesterol. I was
being used on his ankle.”

Medical records conﬁrm that for ap-
proximately 15 minutes at 3 p.m. onjan.
4, the bag was pressed on Williams’ foot
after an Ultimate Frisbee accident in an
effort to dull the pain of a sprain.

“You can imagine my heartbreak. I

didn’t even get a chance to lower his risk ‘

of stomach cancer and type-2 diabetes.”
“Joe Williams is the biggest assh*le

Life can be rough in the hack of the freezer. Kenny Ong [Visual Editor

between myself and the toaster oven.”
Unable to leave the freezer because
of a general inability to move, the bag

faces added frustration given his potential 

prospects elsewhere. Insiders believe he
would perform very well in a compost
pile, helping to add necessary nitrogen
to decaying foodstuffs and grasses. Even
in a landﬁll, the peas would be useful,
eventually allowing a gaping hole in the
ground to be ﬁlled and potentially topped
with a park or forest. _ c

“He really deserves a go. At least I’ve
been opened, ya know?” says a bag of Gi-
ant Eagle Frozen Carrots, who have been
in the freezer for six months. “I mean,
uh, he didn’t eat anything, but he made
an effort. I think he ended up ordering a
pizza instead.” . »

“It’s such a shame,” add the Carrots.

“When Joe made a stew in October, he

_ was about to use the Peas, but his friend .

told him ‘not to eat like a goddamn prin-
cess’ and he decided to stick to meat and
potatoes. We were all upset, but the Peas

took it the worst. Imagine, going in a slow.

cooker! It’s like a legume jacuzzi.”
Nonetheless, Williams insists he will

notvdo anything with the vegetables,__ex—

cept eat them. .

“Man, I’ve been trying to eat healthy
for years. If I just throw them away, it
will be like I’ve just given up. Like I said,
2013 is going to be my year. Watch out,
here I come.”

As of today, the Green Peas are un-
reachable, pushed to the back of the freez-
er by a six pack of pizza Hot Pockets and
a restaurant—sized boxvof taquitos. I

Notre Dame succumbed 48-14 to head coach
N ick~_Saban’s incredibly talented and conﬁ-
dent team, which has now won three of the
last four national titles.

N otre Dame, playing for its ﬁrst title since
1988, grabbed many of the headlines in the
lengthy buildup to the game because of the
Fighting Irish’s improbable perfect season

' that galvanized the prestigious school’s fans.

But that changed the moment Monday

night’s game kicked off. Alabama stole the.

show in a lopsided championship contest,
racing out to a 28-0 halftime lead and never
looking back, as the Tide pounded the life
and luck out of the Irish.

But this utter destruction at Sun Life Sta-
dium in Miami, between college football’s two
most storied programs, was more about Ala-
bama’s supremacy than N otre Dame’s futility.

Ironically, Alabama’s rise to a level of
dominance not seen since the Nebraska

‘teams of the mid—1990s began when Saban

left Miami, ditching the NFL’s Dolphins af-
ter two seasons at the professional level to
take over a struggling, sleeping—giant college
football program. .

When Saban arrived in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,

SPORTS

in 2007, the Crimson Tide were coming off a

6-7 season, facing NCAA sanctions and hadn’t
won a Southeastern Conference champion-
ship since 1999. The job seemed tricky, even
for_ a man who had previously turned around

‘ thefootball teams, at Toledo, Michigan State

and LSU in his lengthy and extensive coach-
ing career — a career that began at his alma
mater, Kent State, in 1972.

But it didn’t take long for Saban to restore
pride in a program that claimed 12 previous

national championships. Now, just six years.

into the new regime, that number is up to
15. And assuming Saban sticks around at
’Bama for the foreseeable future, it could
continue to rise. ‘

What Coach Saban has already accom-
plished at Alabama is truly remarkable.
By recruiting the best talent the South has
to offer and molding such skilled athletes
into complete football players, his squads

‘ have battered opposing teams and left rival
coaches shaking their heads and wondering‘

how any college football team could be so
strong, quick and smart all at the same time.
A publicly soft-spoken man who saves his
emotional, ﬁery moments to pump up his
players, Saban is already halfway to match-
ing the six national titles the legendary Paul
“Bear” Bryant won at Alabama.
A The 61-year-old Saban, who also won a
national championship at LSU before join-
ing the Dolphins, may go down as the best

_ collegiate football coach to ever live if he

keeps this up.

Seasons culminating with BCS national
championships have become the norm for
Saban—coached teams, and he treated last
night as such, saying in an interview with

Alabama head coach Nick Saban lifted the national championship trophy for the

fourth time after his team beat Notre Dame 48-14 on Monday. MCT Campus

will begin their preparations for the 2013
season, hoping to win a third consecutive and

TASSER’S TAKE

Breaking down the  new collective bargaining agreement

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Thankfully, it seems that hockey is ﬁnally
back. ,,
And not a moment too soon. With col-

lege football over, and the NFL regular

season’s wounds still fresh, I was running
out of stuff to watch on TV. To many, the
National Hockey League lockout was a

pointless, irritating and oftenvconfusing .

clash of egos. It appears that the teams will
play a truncated 48-game schedule — all
within their own conference and with a
great bulk of play happening within their
own divisions —— with play set to begin
aroundjan. 19. That is, if all goes accord-
ing to plan.

5 Anyway, here aresome of the finer

details that the league and the NHL Play- '

ers Association ironed out at 4:45 a.m.
onjan. 6. ' ’

A 10-year collective bargaining agree-
ment with an opt-out clause for either
side after eight years

The league reportedly wanted a 10-
year deal at minimum, while the players
favored a deal lasting six to eight years.
This is good; the longer the collective bar-
gaining agreement, the more time passes

before the fans have to worry about this ’

happening again. But then again, the last
lockout was seven years ago and it feels
like yesterday.

.,

A 50-50 split in hockey-related revenue
(HRR) .

Previously, the players were on the bet-
ter half of a 57-43 split. And the NHL’s
initial (terrible) offer back in September
suggested a switch to a 54-46 split in fa-
vor of the owners. HRR was a buzzword
that populated many party conversations
and boisterous SportsCenter arguments
regarding the lockout. But nobody was
really sure what it encompassed.

Sports Illustrated describes the split
as thus: “In the broadest sense (and with
speciﬁc exclusions), HRR includes money
from regular season and playoff gate re-
ceipts; preseason and special games (such
as international exhibitions); national,
international and national digital broad-

casts; the NHL Network; all local cable,

over-the—air, pay-per—view and satellite ,,

TV broadcasts; local radio; club internet
sites; all club publications, merchandise
and novelty items sold in and out of arenas ;
concessions; luxury boxes, suites and pre-
mium seats; fixed and temporary signage

and arena sponsorships; rinkpboard ad-j
vertising; parking in,club—operated facili-‘i

ties.” But it excludes: “money teams make
from waiver claims on players; money the
NHL makes from moving teams or grant-_
ing expansion franchises; revenues that
teams receive from operating other clubs,

such as AHL affiliates; ﬁnes collected from. _

players and teams; any money teams make

The Panthers notched their first Big East win of the season last night. Huailei Wang |
Senior Staff Photographer

midway through the first half.

With the contest’s physical nature,

both teams were committing numerous
fouls, and the Hoyas used that to their
advantage by converting free throws to
keep them in the game.

But Pitt’s teamwork and effort e no
Panther scored more than eight points in
the first half, and nine of the 10 Panthers
scored — helped the visitors to a 37-22
halftime lead. ‘

While turnovers and fouls plagued

much of the first-half action, when the
teams managed to get a shot off, they
fared pretty well. Pitt shot 15—for-26 (57.7
percent), and the Hoyas converted 6 of
16 shots (37.5 percent). The Panthers
also drained 4 of 5 shots from behind
the 3-point line, a facet of their game that
had been struggling heading into Tues-
day’s game.

set a similar tone for the second half by
scoring on the Panthers’ ﬁrst possession,
and Pitt stretched its lead to as many as 19
in the early stages of the second period.

The junior forward, who is Pitt’s lead-
ing scorer this season, ﬁnished with 15
points on 7-for-9 shooting and grabbed
four rebounds.

The Hoyas, who were also searching
for their ﬁrst Big East win of the season,
t_ried to make a run by scoring the game’s
next six points to cut the deficit to 47-34,.

But Adams slammed home his second

‘powerful dunk of the game, which sparked

a quick 8-0 run that essentially secured
the crucial victory for head coach Jamie
D_ixon’s team. “

Coach Dixon had said his Panthers
needed to “get to work,” especially on
defense and rebounding, after Pitt began
the Big East season with losses against
Cincinnati and Rutgers. And his players
responded with their best outing of the
campaign in those two categories, out-
rebounding the Hoyas 27-20 and holding
the home team to just_45 points.

Looking to build off the resounding ’

victory, the Panthers will return home
to face Marquette at the Petersen Events
Center on Saturday at noon.

course. The floor of the salary cap will be
about $44 million. The ﬁxed cap was an
issue that went hand—in—hand with player
contracts, which had been getting a bit
out of control (see Zach Parise and Ryan
Suter, both now of the Minnesota Wild).

The league wanted a $60 million cap for
the first full season, and the NHL Players
Association wanted a $70 million cap. Why
is compromise so hard?

A seven-year maximum on player con-
tracts with the possibility of an extra
year for’ teams re—signing their own
players

Also, the variance on salaries will be
limited to 35 percent each year, and at no
point can a season’s salary be less than 50
percent of the highest—paid year ofthe deal.

‘This was a big concession by the NHL.
In its New Yearis Eve proposal, the league
offered a 10 percent variance each year,
and Bill Daly, deputy commissioner and
chief legal officer of _the NHL, had previ-

ously stated that a five—year maximum was‘

“the hill we would die on.”

Bad metaphors aside, the league ab-
solutely needed a contract maximum. No
more 15-year, $100—million contracts, like
the one the New Jersey Devils gave Ilya
Kovalchuk that paid out $90 million over

.. the ﬁrst 10 years of the contract and only '

$10 million over the last ﬁve, ensuring the
salary cap hit was a respectable‘ — for an
elite player —— $6.67 million.

$200 million of revenue sharing, up
from a reported $140-180 million per
year

The NHL Players Association initially
insisted on revenue sharing upward of

- $250 million, while the league wished for
’ . that number to remain the same. ’

Don’t we just love compromising‘?

All 14 non—playoff teams are now eligible
to win draft lottery -

This is fun. Previously, only the bottom
five teams were eligible to win, but now
every sad-faced fan whose team doesn’t
reach the promised land has a little bit of
a silver lining.

If only they had this rule for the NFL, we

.,Steelers fans might not be quite as grouchy.
