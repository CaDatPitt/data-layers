Reagan’s.‘Star Wars’
debated at CMU talk  

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Dr. Joseph Coffey, director of In-
ternational Security Studies at Pitt,
and Maj. Simon Warden, special assis-
tant to the director of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, debated the feasibili-
ty and practicality of President
Reagan’s “Star Wars” program
Wednesday night at Camegie-Mellon
University.

Warden, who for the most part
espouses the viewpoint of President
Reagan, strongly advocated the
Strategic Defense Initiative, claiming
that the system, if completed, could

. go a long way in serving as a deter-

rent to a Soviet pre-emptive nuclear
strike.

‘ ‘If we achieve our technical objec-
tives,” Warden said, “their [the
Soviets’] continuing to build offensive
weapons would be silly  we are
hoping the SDI will render Soviet
ICBMs as impotent as will a machine .
gun render a regiment of foot
soldiers.”

Coffey offered a contrasting view-
point. “Even if the SDI is feasible,
and I don’t know that it is,” he
remarked, “there are many things the
Soviets could do offensively to nullify
the effectiveness of the system.”

Coffey also expressed fears that the
SDI would serve to destabilize both
U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-NATO rela-
tions. Coffey said he feels the SDI
would create additional tensions with
the Soviet Union. He said he views
the SDI as a sort of shield for a U.S.
pre-emptive nuclear strike. 1

In addition, Coffey stated, “There
is, to my knowledge, not a single
Western European nation, with the
possible exception of Great Britain,
which is supportive of the SDI.”

On the issue of expense, both Cof-
fey and Warden agree that at this

point, it would be virtually impossi-
ble to estimate the cost. Coffey,
however, said he sees the anticipated
high expenditures as a major reason
that the United States should not
develop the system.

‘ ‘If one now begins to spend nine to
15 percent of the U.S. defense budget
on the SDI,” Coffey said, “what will
happen to our other military pro-
grams?”

Liz Hughes, chairman of the Penn-
sylvania Consumer Party, reacted
sharply to the issue of Star Wars’ an-
ticipated costs, urging both Warden
and Coffey to support the allocation
of funds to social programs which
would “beneﬁt humanity” rather than
to new weapons systems. ~

Of particular concern to the au-
dience, which was composed largely
of CMU students, was the fact that the
SDI will, if and when it is indeed
deployed, be autonomously controlled
by computer. Several students
posed questions to Warden pertaining
to the possible strategic ramiﬁcations
of mechanical malfunction and the-
subsequent inadvertent activation of
the system.

Warden, though, quickly came to
the SDI’s defense. “The conse-
quences of unintentionally activating
the SDI are very minimal. What’s
more,” Warden said, “the SDI is
different from ballistic missiles in that
if anything does go wrong, only small,
harmless projectiles will most likely
be discharged."

Both debators expressed their
respective commitments to world
peace and alluded to the importance
of reaching an agreement in the up-
coming Geneva talks.

“If a compromise is not forthcom-
ing and the Soviets continue to build
offensive weapons, and we begin to
rapidly develop and then deploy
defensive weapons, we will all be in-
volved in a new arms race.”

Pitt to create Honors college

By Mary Daigle
Editor in Chief _

It’s 4 p.m. and anotherday of classes
is wrapping up at the University of
Pittsburgh‘. But, the suite on the 35th
ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning is
ﬁlled with students. In the main room
there is a student typing. Behind her,
two young men are nervously shaking
their legs as they play a game of chess.
Past them, a group of students are sit-
ting in the lounge area.

The setting here at the University
Honors Program is important, says
Sandra Perez, a freshman studying
chemistry and theater. Perez said she
decided to come to Pitt because of the
academic community offered by the
Honors Program. Such a community
is rare in such a large commuter institu-
tion, where the diligent student often
gets lost in the shufﬂe, she said. '

“It’s a home base to come back to
during the day. It’s a place where I can
study or get help with developing ideas.
I can come here to study as much as
I like without being considered a freak.
I’m not looked down upon because of
the amount of studying I do,” Perez
said.

In addition to the academic com-
munity, the Honors Program offers
classes in many areas of undergraduate
study. However, the classes are not
randomly selected. An instructor must

* send a proposal to Alec Stewart, Direc-
‘ tor of the Honors Program, explaining

why the course is of honors caliber and
how the course will be run. '

According to Stewart, the honors
Program Advisory Board then decides
if the course shoud be offered under the
Program. “The basic criteria for
classes is that they be academically
challenging. We don’t want the courses
to be accelerated, just in depth. We’d
rather see students lingering over a
good idea than go through things too

fast,” Stewart said.

One adviser and two staff people are
available during the day to any student
taking a UHP class or who is interested
in the program.

“You don’t have to take an honors
class to beneﬁt from the advising. This
is a non-member program. We have
over 700 students involved in the pro-
gram and not all of them take honors
courses every term,” said Stewart.

Now, in order to take the Program
one step further, the university is plan-
ning to establish an Honors College.

The college, says Stewart, will still
be open to any interested student en-
rolled at Pitt. Its main purpose will be
to give those students who are willing
to “run academically.’ ’ the recognition
they deserve. Students who fulfill the
requirements of the proposed college
will receive degrees in both their col-
lege majors (i.e. engineering) and the
Honors College.

Presently, students receive no cer-
tiﬁcation for their efforts in the pro-
gram. “There is a need for incentive
and for recognition of educational at-
tainment by students -who are motivated
and capable,” said Stewart.

The idea of establishingthe college ,
came from a recommendation by.

Stewart to Provost Roger Benjamin in
his Phase I Planning report on the
UHP. Benjamin then advised Stewart
to create a committee to deﬁne the
details of the college.

The committee included Professor
Gerald Massey from the philosophy
department. Massey, who taught at the
Michigan State University, which is
one of the only other schools in the
country to offer an Honors College op-
tion, contributed insight to the con1mit-
tee on the details of the college.

“Michigan State has a well estab-
lished program. However, they only
offer a certiﬁcate, not a degree. We

plan to offer our students a joint degree
with their home school,” said Stewart.

According to Stewart, the transition
from program to school _will not
drastically increase the UHP budget.
“We might have to hire one or two ad-
visers along the way, but there is no
plan to increase the staff immediately,”
he said. ‘

The program, in it’s eighth year, has
gained the support of the administra-
tion to establish the college. Stewart is
hoping to get approval from the
University Senate by Thanksgiving. .

“If all goes as planned we should
have our ﬁrst graduating class in
1987,” Stewart said.

Perez said she is excited about the
proposal for an Honors college..
“Knowing about the change this early
is exciting. I can get more in depth in
my area of interest and then possibly
get a diploma for it. What I like about
the idea is that it allows you to fail. If
I don’t pass my senior thesis, I still will
have a degree in my major,” she said.

Beyond ﬁlling the requirements for
the students’ home school, the re-
quirements for receiving a degree from
the college will be to either do a senior
thesis or get the degree by an examina-
tion on their research. .

Pat Riles, a senior English literature

major who has beerran Honors student ,

since her freshman year, said she feels
that an Honors College will be
especially beneﬁcial to students in the

. larger » departments.

“In a lot of the larger departments,
only the No. 1 student in the class gets
noticed. The rest of the department
goes unnoticed. The curriculum is very
passive. There is no senior thesis or in
depth research,” she said.

“We’re asking students to take a
harder way through Pitt. For their ef-
forts, we’re seeking to increase the
quality of their degree,’ ’ said Stewart.

Study examines dangers of porn

By Dolores Rice
For The Pitt News

The Pennsylvania Coalition Against
Pornography held a press conference
last weekend at the William Penn Hotel
downtown. Although few showed up,
the two—day Regional Conference On
Obscenity, sponsored in part by the
PCAP, plowed ahead anyway, leaving
behind some stark facts about one per-
vasive aspect of today’s society.

The keynote speaker, Dr. Judith
Reisman, is a research professor at
American University and a principal
investigator of a project entitled ‘ ‘The
Role of Pornography in Family
Violence, Sexual Exploitation and
Juvenile Delinquency,” which is par-
tially funded by the U.S. Department
of Justice.

Reisman told the audience of a little
more than 100 people that mainstream
pornography has become a “dominant
form of sexual education for children.’ ’
There are 250 kiddie porn magazines
on the market, some selling for $40
each. There are 400 “skin” magazines
in some 15,000 book stores, she said.
Pornography will do an estimated $8
billion business this year. That is equal
to the combined revenues of conven-
tional movie and record industries.

Reisman conducted her study on
three magazines, Hustler, Playboy and
Penthouse, which devote a large
percentage of their pages to pictorials
of females and images of children

‘ ‘Pornography wasn ’t the only negative inﬂuence in
my life, but itseﬁfect on me was devastating  I lost
all sense of decency and respect for humanity. ”

— Arthur Gary Bishop
convicted child killer

engaged’ in sexual or violent behavior.

, No articles were studied, only pictures

and cartoons. Cartoons, Reisman
pointed out, were chosen because of the
“powerful” statements that can be
made with them and because they
fascinate children.

Jean Ruhlman, speaker and
workshop leader at the conference, told
of a 15-year-old boy who hung himself
by making a noose out of his mother’s
stockings. At his feet lay a por-
nographic bondage magazine opened to
a picture and article giving instructions
on how to masturbate while hanging.

‘ ‘Nearly 75 percent of pornographic
material ends up in the hands of a
child,” Ruhlman said. “This includes
magazines, the Playboy channel [cable
TV], Dial-a-pom and adult books.
Some of it can be bought by minors,
but most of it is found in the parents’
or friends’ homes.”

“Children learn by watching,”
Reisman said. “They see a picture, and
they, in turn, may imitate that picture.”
She told of a recent happening in New
York where two boys, aged six and

seven, after seeing similar pictures in

a porn magazine which was in the .

house, decided to insert pencils and
other objects into the baby girl they
were babysitting. This and other~un-
conﬁrmed activities resulted in the
baby’s death.

Topics covered in the mainstream
magazines Reisman studied included
rape, incest, bondage, sadism,
homosexuality and lesbianism. She
pointed out issues with articles entitled
“Mothers and Daughters” and “Father
knows Best,” both complete with
photographs. Hustler runs a regular
cartoon called “Chester the Molester”
in which the targets of Chester are
primarily children. The October 1976
issue of Playboy, under the column
heading “Kid Stuff,” stated that
“children have more eroticism than
adults are willing to admit.”

Shifting from ﬁction to reality,
Reisman relayed the sharp increase
since 1977 in veneral disease (name-
ly, gonorrhea of the mouth) found in
children under the age of ﬁve. Some

Bus bombing hurts many in Athens

ATHENS, Greece — Greek police
said a large number of people were in-
jured when a bomb hidden under a
public transport bus exploded on a
coastal street in Athens last night. It
was not immediately known how close
the explosion was to a U.S. Air Force
base which lies just off the avenue. An
anonymous male caller claiming to
speak for the previously unknown
Revolutionary Left-Wing Party warned
a pro—govemment newspaper of the ex-
plosion five minutes before it
happened.

Student nabs gun,
stops shoot-out .

SPRINGFIELD, Pa. —- John Laufer
said yesterday he thought he was put-
ting an end to a tasteless Halloween
prank that was panicking shoppers at
a local mall.

Laufer walked up to a woman who
was shooting at him yanked a-
semiautomatic riﬂe from her ‘ grasp.
The 24-year-old graduate student said
that at the time he thought it was a very
poor prank that was causing mass panic
in the mall.

He said he did not realize the gun
was real until after he walked up to the
woman, grabbed her, took the weapon
from her grasp and noticed shoppers _
lying injured on the ﬂoor of the mall.

Laufer said the small woman clad in
fatigues had fired about two dozen
shots in the Springﬁeld Mall — in-
cluding ﬁve at him.

“I don’t have an answer why I was
not hit,” he said.

Soviets swap
spies for dissidents

BONN, West Germany —- The
United States, Soviet Union and East
and West Germany are negotiating an
exchange of Soviet spies for leading
Russian dissidents.

Unnamed diplomatic sources in
Bonn and Washington ‘claim Soviet
dissidents Andrei Sakharov and Anato-
ly Scharansky are at the center of the
trade.

The trade should take place after the
superpower summit scheduled for Nov.
19-20 in Geneva.

J ‘Juan’ destroys
southern coasts

Louisiana -— Louisiana Governor
Edwin Edwards likened still-brewing
tropical storm Juan to something from
a “ghoulish movie” before it left his
state to wreak more destruction on
nearby areas.

1 Yesterday afternoon, the storm was

centered just inland near Foley, Ala.,
with top winds of 60 mph, mainly over
the water south and east of the center.

Fishing boats off the shores of
Alabama and Florida raced for cover,
and residents of the Florida Panhandle
were advised to take precautions. The
two-story beachfront Dunes Hotel, left
shaky after hurricane Elena passed
through Santa Rosa Island, Fla., last
month, yesterday toppled in the sand.

The director of the National. Hur-
ricane Center said Juan, with its ill-
deﬁned center, shou1dn’t grow any
stronger. Forecasters hoped it would
weaken as it passed over Alabama and
Georgia.

of the harder core magazines contain
articles on how to attack children in
parks, how to arouse your daughter/ son
and even how to swap — not husbands
and wives but children. Pornography
is not a victimless crime, Reisman
emphasized.

Ruhlman read part of a confession
written by convicted child killer Arthur
Gary Bishop, who waits on death row
in the Utah State Prison. He was heavi-
1y involved with pornography,
speciﬁcally involving young boys. He

called pornography an addiction on .

which he spent thousandsof dollars on
magazines and videos. Eventually the

, pornography wasn’t enough, and he

started to lure young boys into posing
and acting out other activities, finally

he killed four of the boys. In the Oct. -

1985 issue of the Morality in Media
Newsletter, Bishop is quoted as saying,
‘ ‘Pornography wasn’t the only negative

inﬂuence in my life, but its effect on ‘

me was devastating  I lost all sense

Senator Arlen Specter commended
the coalition for their work in the bat-
tle against pornography. Reisman was
surprised at the senator’s change of
heart. When she started her research
in 1984, Specter publicly denounced

. her for “embarking on research that

was irrelevant.” From the senator’s
hearings, rumors were circulated im-
plying that the researchers were hav-
ing a good time looking at dirty
pictures. A _

“It "was nice to see that Senator
Specter, from all appearances, realized
that he was on the wrong path,”
Reisman said.

Much of the publicity these days sur-
rounds the rock music debate “to rate
or not to rate.” Bob DeMoss, a musi-
cian, disc jockey, media consultant for
the Pittsburgh Leadership Foundation
and speaker at the Pornography in the
Rock Music Industry seminar, com-
mented on pornography’s impact on
music.

“I am not a hater of rock music,”

which pictured a very young girl, nude
on the cover.” The album Cover has
since been replaced.

DeMoss showed the conference a
multimedia display of eight popular
performers of today: Madonna, David
Lee Roth, Motley Crue, Ozzie

. Osborne, Duran Duran, Jim Morrison,

Prince and AC/DC. Presented on three
large screens with music ampliﬁed
through an elaborate stgereo system,
the show spoke for itself.

Hollywood’s “Relax” and an unedited

Following last year’s 3-7-1 football season, there era

was a drop of student interest in the football pro-
gram on the Pitt campus. During the past summer,
in an effort to regain some interest in the football
program, the Student Government Board and the
Ofﬁce of Student Activities, in cooperation with the
football ofﬁce, introduced Foge Fazio’s Monday
Morning Quarterback Club.

The Quarterback Club was supposed to be a
forum where Pitt students could ‘-‘meet the Pitt
coaches and players up close and personal every
Monday after football games.” The Quarterback
Club also promised that the Pitt coaching staff
would ‘ ‘review the past game, preview and provide
scouting reports on the upcoming game and answer
questions from the audience.” _

Just as in life, what is promised is not always what
is delivered. Instead of it being what was original-
ly planned, the Quarterback Club has merely turned out
to be a forum where Pitt students grill Fazio about his
coaching decisions on the football ﬁeld.

Furthermore, the Quarterback Club has provided Pitt
students with a chance to reveal their ignorance con-
cerning the game of football and for Fazio to reveal how
much class he has by not walking out in the middle of
the meeting. A

Farrakhan, Issue

In the Oct. 30 issue of The Pitt News,
Janet L. «Martin made several remarks
which I felt were totally without basis
or reason. I found her letter, at best,
very disturbing. She remarked, “I’m
not completely sure I understand why
it [Farrakhan’s lecture] has turned in-
to a controversial issue.” She went on,
“I’m concerned much of it is unwar-
ranted and fake.”

I ask you, Ms. Martin, where do you
get your information, Yhe National En-
quirer perhaps?

To suggest that the whites are in
some type of conspiracy against blacks
is preposterous. Certainly there are
racists remaining, but that is not the
consensus. -

You even attempted to compare Far-
rakhan with Martin Luther King Jr.
That’s like comparing Satan with
Moses. ‘

The remarks that Farrakhan made
are not alleged, they are veriﬁed facts.
I could present to you a computer print-
out of 64 newspaper and magazine ref-
erences to Farrakhan, which can be
found in The New York Times,
Washington Post, etc. (And that is on-
ly the tip of the iceberg.)

You go on to say, “The consensus
among the majority of whites is: The
only good black is a quiet black.” I am

that might be precisely what the intent
is. If you disagree with Farrakhan, then
go and listen closely to what he has to
say. In this way, you will know how
to act if you want to make changes.
Know thine enemy.

. Linking Issues

I propose that the trustees of the
University of Pittsburgh take the
following two actions:

1. Divest the university of all invest-
ment, direct or indirect, in companies
which do business in South Africa; and

2. Deny permission for Louis Far-
rakhan to use university facilities to
speak or receive student fees for his
lecture.

I suggest that anyone who supports
one of these actions but not the other
is guilty of hypocrisy. .

The racism of the South African
government and the racism of Louis
Farrakhan are cut from the same cloth.
At their core, both are based on
stereotyping a certain group or groups,
ascribing to them various negative or
evil attributes and appealing to fear and
hatred to build or hold power. The only
difference is that P.W. Botha runs a

for to make your views felt. We are still
relevant!

Racism on Board

Unarmed black South Africans con-

institutions totally divest funds from

exploitation. The University of Pitts-
burgh’s board of directors refuses to
divest and, instead, continues to do
business with companies that adhere to
the bogus Sullivan Principles.
What’s going on here? Surely the
men on the board (supposedly
enlightened humanists) know that U.S.
companies upholding Sullivan only
employ 22,000 blacks, and that only
four percent of these are managers.
Surely these “gentlemen” realize that
Sullivan makes no provisions for the
promotion and hiring of blacks to the
higher paying, high-skilled jobs; if so,
the four percent cited above would read
80 percent. (Yes, black and white

For the Dissent/ Marc Chandler

 

Farrakhan’s Challenge; Views Reﬂect Societal Divisions

Even that which we abhor we must
seek to understand. To understand does
not mean to condone. And there is no
condoning the racism and anti-
Semitism of one Louis Farrakhan. But
if we were simply to write off everyone
who is racist and/or anti-Semitic, many
of us ‘would have few friends and
relatives. In effort to debunk Far-
rakhan’s anti-Sernitism, student leaders
have obscured the issues. Even the civil
libertarians, in their defense of Far-

rakhan’s right to speak, fail to address .

the issues. I submit that Farrakhan
raises important questions that we must
come to grips with no matter how ap-
palling we ﬁnd his rhetoric. Space per-
mits only a sketch of considerations that
an informed discussion of Farrakhan

would naturally entail.

Rev. Farrakhan’s remarks against
Judaism are not signiﬁcantly different
from what good Christians have been
saying for centuries: Because Jews do
not recognize Jesus as the Christ, they
cannot know salvation. Similarly, Jews
have historically been falsely accused
of killing Jesus. Furthermore, many
scholars locate the origin of modern
anti-Sernitism in Christianity. The anti-
Sernitic stereotypes that Farrakhan par-
rots are more prevalent in our society
than many of us would care to admit.

Farrakhan comes out of the genre of
black leadership that whites (including
white liberals) and the black middle
class have traditionally found offen-
sive. His intellectual progenitors in-

clude W.E.B. Dubois, Marcus Garvey
and Malcolm X. Whites and the black
middle class ﬁnd leaders of the Booker
T. Washington, Martin Luther King
and Benjamin Hooks variety more
palatable and less dangerous.

Since the early 1970s black leaders,
most notably Jesse Jackson, Louis Far-
rakhan and Andrew Young, have sup-
ported the national aspirations of the
Palestinian people. This conﬂicts with
our much-criticized national policy and
the interests of many of the pro-Zionist
Jewish organizations. Moreover,
Israel’s support of South Africa further
complicates the issue.-

Domestically, black leaders have
been advocating an expanded welfare
state. They favor afﬁrrnative action and

quotas. This is contrary to the national
agenda as articulated by both the
Republican and Democratic parties.

The dissolution of the civil rights
coalition can be explained to a great
degree by the fracture of black-Jewish
relations. The real rainbow coalition
that actually elects black politicians to
ofﬁce continues to be the traditional
alliance of blacks and liberal Jews. As
a group, Jews prospered by the New
Deal and the Great Society in ways that
blacks did not. The disparity between
the Jews’ position in American socie-
ty and that of blacks, coupled with their
divergent views on the Middle East, act
as a centrifugal force on the
relationship.

Besides an insipid variant of black

nationalism, Farrakhan and the Nation.
of Islam espouse petty, bourgeois
values associated with entrepreneurship
and reactionary social beliefs, including
anti-feminism, anti-homosexuality,
anti-abortion and anti—integration. It
suggests the shallowness of Far-
rakhan’s vision of the future for the im-
poverished black minority in America.

Lastly, allow me to conclude by
reiterating that the point here is not to
apologize for Farrakhan, but merely to
suggest certain crucial issues, which,
-in spite of his racist and anti-Semitic
rhetoric, he challenges us to address
head-on. It is a shame that Farral_<han’s
medium is not more conducive to an
intelligent and informed discussion of
these more substantial issues.

Simply Speaking/ Edward Shadder

A Proposed Solution for AIDS, a Modern Epidemic

AIDS is presently the government’s
No. 1 health problem. It has surpassed
accidents, homicides, and even suicides
as the leading cause of death among
New York’s men aged 25 to 40.
Already 13,000 Americans have con-
tracted this disease. Half of them are
dead. The other half are dying.

By 1986, 26,000 people will have
AIDS. This number will double by
1987. The victims will not only be
homosexuals, they will be men, women
and children.

One hundred twenty heterosexual
men and women have already con-
tracted AIDS through intercourse. The
innocence of 150 children has been
violated by this disease. They did not
bring their afﬂiction upon themselves.
It was given to them through AIDS-
contaminated parents and blood
transfusions. The AIDS epidemic is
real. The AIDS problem’ must be
solved.

Millions of dollars are being thrown
at scientists to fund the quest for a cure.
But this elusive cure presently has the
medical community stymied. Even if
a cure is found, the fact remains: You
can still get AIDS. ‘

It is because of this fact that more
emphasis must be placed on preventing
the disease from spreading. Some
medical and political measures are cur-
rently being taken. Blood donations are
now being screened for AIDS ‘con-
tamination. This action greatly beneﬁts
the high risk group of transfusion re-
cipients and hemophiliacs. Dentists are

being encouraged to wear rubber

gloves to prevent AIDS from spreading
through their patient’s saliva.

Some other measures that are being
taken have been described as “witch
hunts’ ’ for homosexuals. San Francisco
is trying to pass public ordinances for-
bidding the licensing of the bath houses

which. have become popular gay
meeting places. Rev. Jerry Falwell had
introduced legislation aimed at closing
gay bars, but shutting down these
places will not stop homosexuality, and
none of these measures will stop the
spreading wildﬁre of AIDS.

An epidemic of this magnitude re-
quires drastic preventive measures.
Drastic measures were taken to ﬁght
smallpox, for example. Across the na-
tion, citizens were required to obtain
a vaccination.

This plan of attack can be applied to
control the spread of AIDS. Granted,
we do not have a vaccine; however, we
do have a concerned government and
devoted citizens. Therefore, it is my
opinion that the government’s health
services ‘should organize a system
whereby all persons between the ages
of 16 and 45 would be required to ob-
tain sexual health checkups every 10

months. Under this system, persons
who were classiﬁed as sexually healthy
would receive an ofﬁcial card which
can be carried with them should they
wish to present it to a prospective sex-
ual partner. A person’s mind could cer-
tainly be set at ease were he able to see

_ this sort of proof.

This idea must not be resented by
naive people who feel capable of
choosing “clean” sexual mates. A
mandatory health checkup is not meant
to insult you, it is meant to keep you
and other deserving people healthy.

A law meant to protect human life
is not unconstitutional. Keeping
America healthy surely promotes
general welfare. Taking a blood test
does not violate human rights. Man-
datory sexual health checkups give
other people the right to feel at ease in
knowing that the carriers of AIDS are
being detected.

A blood test is quick, painless, cheap
and self-assuring. At the rate AIDS is
spreading right now, by the year 1987

_$5 billion will have been spent on the

care of AIDS sufferers. Our govern-
ment had decided to cover those crippl-
ed from AIDS with Social Security and
disability payments. The cost of a blood

test must surely be cheaper than the -

cost of monthly AIDS compensations.

The AIDS blood test could be ad-
ministered by your family doctor or
any free clinic. The armed forces and

places of employment could require the v

test or a card certifying that the test was
taken as a prerequisite for applicants
and a requirement for those presently
in service. Certainly this type of law
should require no penalty. All it needs
is support in the form of American
citizens taking their sexual health
checkup and being concerned about
those who do not.

It happened right here in Pittsburgh.
The “GQ Live” fashion show came to
Kaufmann’s. It was an elegant affair,
transforming the men’s department
from a sales boutique into a nightclub.
Not only were guests treated to a quali-
ty fashion show, but they received the
red carpet treatement to boot!

As you entered the store, you were
greeted by’ a jazz guitarist and a wet
bar. Then, in the main area, there were
trays of tasty hors d’oeuvres, a travel
display, a jazz band laying down some
smooth tunes and three more__bars.

Two jolly gents pack punch at Point Park

By Leslie Bennett

What an odd and revitalizing transi-
tion a modern theatre goer must make
in order to appreciate a musical p.|ay
— or for that matter, to even have the
patience to sit through one. With all the
serious irony and social commentary

"going on in drama these days, the

musical can sometimes compare to a
childish circus of silly dialogue and
frivolous song. That is, of course,
unless it succeeds in wooing the au-
dience into its own world of utter
amusement. E||iot’s phrase best
describes that audience as “distracted
from distraction by distraction.”

Point Park Theatre Company’s cur-
rent musical production of Two
Gentlemen of Verona is a good exam-
ple of "this kind of enchahtment. The
first 20 minutes may seem barely
tolerable until it eventually warms up
to melt every modernist sensibility in
the theater. lt’s like drinking tequila —
a little bit hard to swallow at first, but
soon you’re spoiled by its festive
flavor, and before you know it, you’re
ordering another pitcher of margaritas.
Self-indulgence is the musical’s tour
de force, and thank goodness there
are still a few around to allow us that
pleasure.

The play is generally described as
a romantic comedy, “strictly for enter-
tainment and not for culture,” and.
though the plot is reallyjust the casual
structure upon which its humor, song

. and dance are fabricated, John Guare

and Mel Shapiro's award-winning

lyrics do remain fairly true to the Bard’s
original in spirit and style.

The opening establishes the two
devoted friends-for-life, Proteus and
Valentine, and sends Valentine off to

Milan to seek his fortune whilst the less ‘

virtuous Proteus stays’ in Verona to
seek his love, Julia. Julia plays hard-
to-get but not for long, and just as the

two make vows of betrothal, Proteus
is sent by his father to Milan to earn
a living of his own.

Upon arriving in Milan, Proteus
doublecrosses both Valentine and
Julia by attempting to seduce Valen-
tine’s beloved Silvia, the sultry, sexy
daughter of the Duke. More chaos
develops when Julia, disguised as a
man, comes to Milan to seek her lost
love and finds him chasing Silvia.

As one of Shakespeare's earliest
works, Two Gentlemen of Verona looks
forward to Romeo and Juliet and
especially Twelfth Night. This produc-
tion is, in fact, strikingly reminiscent of
the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival's Twelfth Night last summer.
Not only is there the colorful diversity
of never-never land costumes (here
designed by Don Difonso) and the
variety of rock-mock musical numbers
(directed by Richard Tobia), but also
in the clown-like character who can
always be seen somewhere on stage
and whose role it is to instigate and set
up the play’s action. The cupid of Two
Gentlemen of Verona is the Feste of
Twelfth Night, and his job, in the
language of the play, is to “metamor-
phose” the hearts of these young
potential lovers.

Ah, but ain’t love grand? lt’s the on-
ly theme suited to the grandiose
nonsense of a musical play, and direc-
tor Jill Wadsworth appropriately treats

( it as such.

in addition to the can-can cabaret
style Silvia (Kim Cea), who sings and

slinks like Mae West never could, the

production also shows off a cool ver-

sion of ldi Amin as the Duke of Milan
(Mike Jones) who’s dressed to kill —

figuratively as well as literally. The two ’

silliest characters are Speed and
Launce (Daniel Krell and Kurt Carley),
the chummy servants, one of whom af-
fects a lisp, the other a drawl; both are
hilarious. More than a few snickers are
heard when the prissy Julia (Janice
Jarabeck) turns out to be a very preg-
nant bride, in the play’s classic comic
ending. But without a doubt, one of the

funniest moments of the production is

when Launce brings his dog, Crab, on
stage and croons a love ballad’ with
guitar. (The well-behaved performance
by a dog named Morgan is
commendable!) ’

Amidst all this nonsense, Julio
Ochoa and Rob Floznowski give no-
nonsense performances of Valentine
and Proteus. Ochoa is especially
entertaining, and his presence com-
mands attention. Roznowski is actually
the better singer, but at times his voice
seems to lack enthusiasm.

Though it's a shame that the pit
band is hidden behind the scaffolding
which ‘serves as stage set, it may
ultimately have been a good idea to
give the singers a better chance to be
heard. All the singing is good, but in
some cases these young voices need
more projection.

Taken for what it’s worth and what
it sets out to be, Two Gentlemen of
Verona turns out to be quite a lot of fun.

Stars sine new light
on forgotten composer

When Lou Reed stated, ‘‘I want to
be the rock-n-roll Kurt Weill  [I want
to] take rock-n-roll, the pop format, and
make it so adults, like myself, could
listen to it,” in an interview, little did he

' knowhis comment would help spawn

the A&M album Lost In The Stars —
The Music Of Kurt Wei//.

The record highlights some of
Weill’s best-known compositions, as
well as some rare pieces, performed
by a group of artists ranging from Sting
to Marianne Faithful to Van Dyke
Parks. And of course Lou Reed.

Weill began writing music in his
native Germany in the 1920s, compos-

ing the classic Threepenny Opera with

lyricist Bertolt Brecht. Under the threat
of Nazi persecution, Weill left Germany
in 1933 and eventually came to live in
the United States.

.Once here, Weill wrotemusic for
such media as the Broadway stage
and popular. commercial music. His
American work seemsless stormy
than the songs he composed in Ger-

» many, but almost all of them have an

unsettling, at times sinister, undercur-
rent running through them.

Most of the songs on Lost In The
Stars rely on traditional orchestral in-
struments for their musical backdrops,
occasionally with the addition of
accordion-like keyboards or guitar.
Outside of the album’s instrumental
tracks — the best of those being the
slow ones, like the enthralling title song
— the music serves almost entirely to

unobtrusively back the arrayof top- .

singers featured on the record.
The three songs from Threepenny
Opera are some of the album’s best

Another one-
night stand

SHOCK
The Motels
Capitol Records .

Somewhere in~Los Angeles, the
Motels are having the last laugh. Their
summer single, “Shame,” did very
well on the charts even though it’s
merely a hybrid of past torchers like
“Only The Lonely” and “Suddenly
Last Summer.” Their latest album,
Shock, is also doing quite well even

 

though it traverses the very ground the
last two albums already covered.
Forgive them, though, because the
Motels aren't just any band; they’re a
good one. They’ve got rhythm, they've
got soul, and Martha Davis has one of
those voices that keeps going through

your mind long after the record’s over. V
" it’s a voice sometimes drowned in im-
minence; it’s believable because Davis

has a heart that's as-breakable as
anyone’_s. She’s a woman with in-
tegrity. _ -

Forget “State of the Heart” and
“Cries and Whispers,” both
uninteresting and cliche-ridden

rendered. Sting’s appropriately black
singing on ‘-‘Mack The Knife,” former
Wall of Voodoo vocalist Stanard
Ridgeway’s surprisingly strong vocals
on “The Cannon Song” and the raw,
authoritative feel of Tom Waite’s
rendering of “What Keeps Man
Alive?” fit perfectly with the style of
Weill’s songs. The choral singing on
“Alabama Song” featuring Richard
Butler of the Psychedelic Furs also
makes for intriguing listening. _

The two songs that differ most from
the album’s standard musical format
also score big. Todd Rundgren and
saxophonist Gary Windo’s version of
“Call From The Grave” seems to have
sprung from a frenzied dance floor,
and “September Song,” performed by
Lou Reed, comes to life with its folksy
guitar accompaniment and Reed’s
trademark style of talk-singing.

Not all of Weill’s songs are un-
familiar to the poplrock world. Bobby
Darin had a hit with “Mack The Knife,”
The Doors covered “Alabama Song”
in 1967, and Lindsay Buckingham
recorded a tense, quirky version of
“September Song” on his 1981album
Law and Order. But the treatment of
Weill’s compositions on Lost In The
Stars warrants listening. f

Although Kurt Weill wrotesongs dur-
ing an era long past, he adapted his
music to his situation and arrived at
compositions evoking strong emo-
tional responses _—— long after his death
in 1950. Lost In The Stars provides an
extensive, if sometimes inconsistent,
collection of Weill’s evocative and
often dark music.

JOHN YOUNG

ballads, though the latter one has an
invitingly jumpy chorus. Davis penned
most of the material here, and she’s
most successful with her songs about

' sex. “My Love Stops Here” provides

a look at promiscuity (I don ’t know you/
I don ‘t know your name/ I don ’t need
to) but notices the nocturnal facade of

prostitution (They look so much prettier/ .

In the heat of the night). _

Musically, though, the real winners
on Shock are the more tussled, more
energetic cuts. “Hungry” is a lively
rock anthem about the whetting of
one’s sexual appetite, complete with
heavy keyboards and lightning-fired
bass. “lcy Red” is a Martha Davis
specialty,‘ a cool and smooth song that
begins slowly, but Davis works it into
a passionate frenzy. And the title cut,
with its vampish choruses and an
opening riptide of electric chords, all
but leaps off the turntable.

Producer Richie Zito consistently
keeps things alive, though the five
songs on side two are noticeably
weaker than those on side one. Davis
has a tendency to sing each word to
death, yet Zito balances her vocal and
songwriting talents wonderfully. Here,
her abilities are showcased to better
advantage than ever before.

Ultimately, that’s.what makes Shock
worthwhile. Though this Los Angeles-
bred band has kept its slick sound,
Davis has matured. She’s ever-
changing and alive, through passion
and heartbreak, and all the more com-
pelling. Listening to the lonely,

breathy, bluesy world of Shock is like A

sitting on the cold floor of a cheap
Manhattan motel in a rainstorm, star-
ing out the window at the red neon as
it flickers: motel, motel, motel.

STRENGTH
The Alarm
I.R.S.

awful thi_ngs — about writing a
“Singles” column is that you occa-
sionally‘ review an advance single
before hearing the whole album, make
a lot of snap judgements and then
hear the lp and realize your foot's in
your mouth. Such is the case here:‘
Several weeks ago, I trashed a new
Alarm song and questioned the viabili-

» ty of the band’s very existence. Now

that I've actually heard the album, l
feel really stupid._ it’s great.

Strength, the second full-length lp
from The Alarm, finds the angry Welsh
quartet mapping out the same territory
as before, but if anything, to better
effect. ‘

The Alarm make no claim to
originality — they’re happy to
acknowledge their debt to U2 — but in
terms of fury, idealism and
righteousness, they’ve cornered the
market. You can count on an Alarm
song to follow a simple pattern: verse,
bridge, chorus, repeat, etc. But
somehow, even though you always

‘know what’s going to happen next (‘‘I

bet he’s going to start yelling now”),
it still works.

The reason for this is that The Alarm
deal wholesale in words like “glory,”
“hope,” “strength ” and “faith,”
words which were supposed to have
lost their bite after World War I. Too
bad they didn’t have rock-n-roll back
then. Suddenly those words have

are so‘ sincere (and naive) that you

believe they really mean what they’re T

saying, and they’re such-good song'-
writers that they convince you to drop
your guard, and your cynicism for a
while.

All of the songs on Strength", with the
exception of one or two ballads like
“Walk Forever by My Side,” are guitar-
led anthems, similar in anger to The
Clash, similar in structure to Bob

- Dylan’s songs, but that, again, wind up‘

sounding like U2. That’s OK. “Spirit of
’76,-” “Father to Son,” “Absolute

  

Reality” and the title track are as‘-vivid
and rousing as anything you’re likely

to hear for a while, and the rest of the.

album isn’t far behind.

The words are painfully straight-
forward — vocalist Mike Peters loves
to write lines like Life is cruel and
unkind, and All I want is someone to
believe in and Somewhere in the

. distance my darling she ‘s a-crying, but

as long as you don’t read the lyric
sheet it’s ‘not so bad.

You get'the impression that The
Alarm is'taking on the whole world. if
it's a losing battle, though, don’t tell
them. Listening to the pulse-quicken-
ing songs on Strength, you almost start
to believe they might win.

Kiss of the Spider Woman

By Manuel Puig

Translated from the Spanish by
Thomas -Colchie

By Bonnie McElhinny
Two men in a cell — one a homosex-

ual, the other a political prisoner.
Molina, the homosexual, insists that

feelings, love and characteristic dif-

ferences between men and women are
not dead. (Note: Although a man
physiologically, Molina considers
himself to be a woman.) Valentin, the
revo|utionary,_thinks that romance is
poppycock, that there is no real dif-
ference between men and women, and
that all relationships should be
subverted to the Cause.

To pass the time, Molina tells Valen-
tin about films he has seen. Most of
them are love stories with an ironic
twist — about a woman who will turn
into a panther if she kisses the man
she loves, about a Nazi propaganda
film where the beautiful French stage
star converts to the Arvan cause after

falling in love with a German soldier,

about a girl who marries a man whose

Molina thinks that women should take
the orders and that relationships are
more of a kick that way, while Valen-
tin protests that both people should be
equal else the relationship is only ex-
ploitation. Molina insists that men are
silent and strong; they know what they
want and where they are going. Valen-
tin retorts that no one has any power
in the world that exists today. The
argument is old, as old as the debates
on the roles of men and women and
between romanticists and political
realists.

The give-and-take can be followed
throughout the book, which is almost
entirely constructed of Hemingway-
esque dialogues (with all the
spareness and inherent difficulties in
following a conversation that the style
entails).

This book is not for those who are -

not willing to open their eyes to a dif-
ferent, often blackly humorous, way of
looking at the world. It is for those in-
terested in reading yet another piece
of innovative fiction from a native
speaker of Spanish. Puig is one very
talented new writer.

By Matthew Yokobosky

When I first saw the Vikings singing
“Spam, Spam, Spam” in “Monty
Python’s Flying Circus,” I was over-
whelmed by this comedy troupe’s
unusual sense of humor. So when A
Private Function, starring Python alum-
nus Michael Palin, opened, I was
delighted that his dry British wit was

* still functioning on an alternative

cerebral plane.

A Private Function is placed in 1940s
wartime Britain, a period when food ra-
tioning became a national pastime.
And as is to be expected, a cluster of
professionals in this particular com-
munity illegally try to fatten their pig in
preparation for a family wedding.

The humor and complications set in

his piano-teaching wife (Maggie Smith)
decide they want to be recognized in
this stuffy town. So they steal the
precious pig in a midnight heist to ob-
tain a large quantity of meat —— a status
symbol among the rationed elite.
The essence of great comedy has
always remained on the shoulders of
the writers and the actors themselves.
In A Private Function, the laurels rest
upon Allan Bennett and his typewriter.
With lines like “He’s got us by the

punctuated

 

“kasighs” and “kafaws.”

From a character standpoint, secon-
daries like Palin’s mother accentuate
his and Smith’s original performance
as Gilbert and Joyce Chilvers. While
the mother remains virtually a sidekick
throughout the first half, she becomes
a key prop when the pig invades their
serene home. Suddenly Mother (Liz

Smith) has a bladder weakness when
the pig has diarrhea, and her senility
at the age of 74 becomes the stock
reply when she repeatedly states “No
pig” to her disbelieving piano pupils.
Like Imogene Coco’s dead grand-
mother on the station wagon in Na-
tional Lampoon's Vacation, the elder-
ly’s lack of mental facilities becomes .

an important dimension to the plot.

her proper Edith Bunker manner) re-
lentlessly tries to arouse Gilbert's
manhood to kill the pig, but only funny
scenes of cowardice and terror arise.
This scene was the highlight of the film
— you’ll see why.

A Private Function is a pleasant relief
from a market filled with pseudo-
Porky’s comedies on teen-age sex and
the now, ever-popular, humorous
werewolf-in-suburbia films. Palin’s
elastic facial contortions and Smith’s

scarf, a unique lapel pin, pattern
braces or a pocket square, the name
of the game is distinction. When trying
to appoint yourself, make sure that you
only have one eye-catching item. Too
many just doesn’t cut it, Jack.

Speaking of Jack (Daniels, that is),
it was this and soda which occupied
me until the ladies’ fashions rolled out.
I seem to remember noting that last
year's business suit has been drop-
ped, as long skirts have come into
vogue. Form-fitting skirts and dresses
cut well below the knee were
presented at the show. It says here
that I talked with Kathy Rilander, a
cosmetics buyer for Kaufmann’s, who
said, “Anything goes —— short, long or
middies,” referring to the lengths of
ladies’ formal wear, I think. “lt all
depends on one’s personal style.”

After the show itself had ended, the
room was spinning and the crowd was
still buzzing. Names were picked for
some great prizes. There was great

stuff. Really. And I've never seen so
many refreshments — I mean, they
were everywhere. Everywhere. Yeah,
anyway, I think I talked to some peo-
ple after the show and they were great,
really great, all of them. I asked them
and they said really great stuff. And the
guy next to me was saying something
but when he turned around he was
gone I don’t know he was gone and
really I was just I and it was she was
what? and I think I where did my arm
go I can’t feel my arm I help oh there
it is under the table and I I I lthink I'm

But seriously, folks.

Personally, I thought the entire pro-
duction was meticulously planned and
tastefully presented. The fashions
were all handsome, but rather predic-
table. Ann Fisher, Kaufmann’s publici-
ty manager, seemed pleased that
everyone’s efforts were received so
well.

Return of the culture monger

By David Zuchowski

Once upon an evening dreary,
while I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a quaint and curious
volume of forgotten /ore,

While I nodded, nearly napping,
suddenly there came a tapping,

As of someone gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door.

Turns out the rapping was a friend
who dropped by to ask me to go bar
hopping with him — or so I thought.
Well, quicker than you can say
onomatopoeia or tintinnabulation, we
were out the door and on our way to
the nearest imbibery.

I was led through the ponderous por-’

tals of Hemingway’s, past the bar and
into the back room where, much to my
astonishment, a poetry reading was
under way. When I complained to my
companion about the misrepresenta-
tion of his request to go drinking, he
explained, chuckling, that he asked me
if I wanted to go bard hopping, not bar
hopping. At this point, I ordered a dou-
ble (entendre, that is) from the cocktail
waitress, figuring I needed something

"I to get me through the night.

I later discovered that there are
poetry readings each Tuesday night at
8 p.m. in Hemingwayls Back Room.
(Admission is free.) I enjoyed myself so
much I wanted more of the same.

Further research revealed another
poetry group in Oakland — an Apollo-
nian faction in Contrast to the Diony-
sian Caucus that meets at Hem-

ingway’s — called the International
Poetry Forum. The group meets the
first Wednesday of each month in
Carnegie Lecture Hall at 8 p.m. The
next program of the forum is sched-
uled for this Wednesday, Nov. 7, and
will feature Australian poet Les A. Mur-

ray reading from his book entitled The
Vernacular Republic. Murray has
received the Australian Society Gold
Medal for 1984 and the New South
Wales Premier's Prize for the best
book of verse. He has been published
in The New Yorker, the Times Literary
Supplement and New Directions.

Future programs include:

Dec. 4: Claims — Shirley Kaufman
reading poems from her recent book
with viola and piano accompaniment
of music by Bloch.

Feb. 5: Autumn’s Legacy —
Readings by Laureano Alban, Costa
Rican ambassador for culture to the
United Nations, with harpsichordist B.
Goeffrey Thomas playing Scarlatti.

March 5: With Dante=- Readings by
John Ciardi from The Divine Comedy.

April 6:, lnscape —- The grand finale
at St. Paul’s Cathedral with reciter and

 

the Mendelssohn Choir in a program
of the poems of Gerard Manley
Hopkins.

Tickets for all five sessions may be
purchased on a student subscription
for only $17. Individual student tickets
are $4. Call 621-9893 for further
information.

My drinking companion and I com-
pleted our night at Hemingway's but
only after he had downed nine beers,
five Dubonnet cocktails, three Brave
Bulls and finally a pina colada — to set-
tle his stomach, he insisted. After
managing to get him back to his apart-
ment, I left him crumpled up, comatose
and insensate on the living room floor.
Taking my leave, I asked if he’d like to
return to Hemingway's the following
Tuesday. He muttered something in-
coherent in a ravenish rasp that vague-
ly sounded like “Nevermore.”

Dear “Singles" readers:
I am a bit under the weather
and have flown to Rio to
recuperate. I will be’ back soon.
Maybe.

‘ By Carrie Stetler

She dyed her hair red.for Live Aid,
married Sean Penn, and since then I
haven’t seen Madonna gracing any
magazine covers except Tiger Beat.
Apparently, no one really cares about
Madonna at the moment, so no one is
sick of her. This is a good time, then,
for me to ask you to reconsider this
shameless Material Girl, the darling of
Fiorenza-sweatered pre-teens, and to
try and recall a time (last year), when
for various absurd reasons, she was
controversial.

This was a time when many maga-
zine editorials, puzzling over her ap-
peal, tirelessly used her to define “the
woman of the ’80s” or accused her of
encouraging sexism and sluttish
modes of dress. Back then, too, the
mere mention of her name or the sight
of those damn lace gloves would pro-
voke “discriminating” rock lovers to
cry ‘‘I hate her. She’s so mindlessl”

' And then they would self-righteously

turn off the radio whenever they heard
the opening strains of “Lucky Star.”

I first saw Madonna in 1983 when
she was on a local Philadelphia dance
show similar to “American Band-
stand.” Her hair was short and she did
this little choreographed dance to
“Everybody” while wearing what looked
like a school girl uniform and a black
bowler . Behind her were two young
men, “Dancin' On Air” regulars,
mimicking her skips and pelvic thrusts
much like the men who mimick her in
the “Dress.You Up” video. I thought
she looked kind of dumb but I still liked
her, and because I was a freshman, I

, considered getting a haircut similar to

hers.

I was shocked to find her on MTV a
year later, rolling around in the streets
for her “Burnin’ Up” video, wearing a
little tank top and an affected pout. I
piously decided not to like her because
she was trying to become a sex object
with such obvious calculation. She
reminded me of the kind of girls I used
to_h_ate_i_n high_ school more than any

other female pop tar I had ever seen.
But then, everyone else began dis-
"liking Madonna for the same reasons

I did, and since I still reluctantly enjoyed '

her music, I took the reactionary posi-
tion of defending Madonna to anyone
who scoffed at her. For instance, if
people said she was “coy,” |’d reply
that she was “campy.” If people ac-
cused her music of being “shallow,”
l’d argue that it was just “really good
pop.”

When I caught myself picking up
magazines for a glance at Madonna’s
latest hairstyle or a glimpse of her

hanging out at the Hard Rock Cafe (in_

 

these pictures she usually looked
slightly drunk or stoned, leering at the
camera and flashing a facetious peace
sign) I realized that I really did like
Madonna, and my reasons for liking
her seemed to be a throwback to my
puberty.

Madonna is strange, because
although she used to wear a “Boy
Toy” belt buckle and tries her darndest
to look sexy, more girls like her than
boys. She inspires, for some reason,
a lot of role identification, more in fact,
than any other female pop star I can
think of (even the Go-Go’s, who were
popular for other reasons).

Much is made of the fact that boys
identify with male rock stars because
they are vicarious expressions of their
own sexuality. Although male rock
stars may sing to or for women (more
often about_ them), they’re often pos-
ing for the benefit of the guys as if to
say: “Look fellas, this may sound like
it’s to her, but it’s really for you
because you understand what it’s like
to be horny.”

Female rock stars almost always
make a sex appeal to their male au-
diences, but they don’t seem to be let-
ting girls in on the fun. They don’t give
their female audience that sly wink
while they’re performing to the males.

Pat Benatar (when she wore
spandex) sounded long-suffering,

challenging or threatening. Although

young girls might admire her boldness
or identify with her fear of being used,
I can’t picture many 14-year-olds
belting out a crude plea for debase-

A ment such as Let me put another notch

in my lipstick case,/ you better make
sure you put me in my place. Benatar

Showcasef,‘7iilové1ﬁtSer"‘iZ"I683 

      
 

\.

 

In man w s  

obviously never played little-girls’
games back then and little-girl games
are precisely what Madonna’s all

about. Compare Benatar’s lyrics with .

the vain shrug of Madonna: Some boys
kiss me/ some boys touch me/ I think
they ’re OK.

Madonna is a teeny-bopper ideal in
a land where there are multitudes of
male idols. Madonna is what young
girls wish they were, think they are, or
think they should be. She has a good,
high voice but not so high that you
can’t sing along with it; she dances
well but a little clumsily; she’s flashy
and a good flirt; and best of all, she
doesn’t care what the other girls think,
so of course they all want to be her
friend.

Her make-up, gyrations and exag-
gerated poses are similar to those of
a 13-year-old girl, discovering . her
power to attract and manipulate boys
amidst the overwhelming peer pres-
sure that she feels to do it right.
Madonna is daring enough to titillate

but sentimental or “virgina|” enough‘

to avoid the label of “s|ut.” For junior
high school and high school girls,

- Madonna probably offers some kind of

hope or example while they are in the
throes of socio-sexual initiation filled
with slavish conformity, fear of disap-
proval and feelings of shame. They

look at, and listen to, Madonna be-

cause she performs a colorful, tuneful
celebration of female adolescent
triumph — the celebrationof the per-
fect tease. Whether this is good or not
is beside the point; in many ways it is
sickening, but it’s energetic and divert-
ing, and for many girls of that age, the
perfect tease is all they can aspire to.

ALVIN AlI.EY   

5.7’

V Viancourt wants to be remembered for something other than the kick

The Pitt News, November 1, 1985

Pitt-Syracuse; two
teams at crossroads

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The scenario may sound familiar and
redundant, but tomorrow’s game with
Syracuse is the most important to this
point. A victory for the Panthers would
revive their chances of a post-season
bowl appearance. Following Pitt’s
shocking defeat at Annapolis at the
hands of the Naval Academy Mid-
shipmen, 21-7, the possibility of a bowl
trip was sidetracked.

“We were very disappointed about
the Navy game,” commented Coach
Foge Fazio on the loss at Navy, “not
only with the result but also with our
performance.” The added notch to the
loss column can’t be changed, but Pitt’s
performance and execution certainly
can be improved.

This week offers Pitt the chance to
rebound,_ as Fazio puts his team’s situa-
tion in the proper perspective. “I feel
after the Navy game our team has come
back to reality,” said Fazio. “The nice
thing about football is that as long as
the season is still going on, you have
another chance to even the score the
next week.”

That’s true of Pitt’s current standing,
but the team they must get through has
every intention of spoiling their plans.
Syracuse head coach Dick McPherson,
in his ﬁfth season, will have his squad
ready. “We’ve been practicing hard all
week, and we will be’ prepared for a
dogﬁght against Pitt.” _

The game also means a lot to the

Syracuse team as they enter the con-
test with a 3-3 mark on the year. After
losing a heartbreaker to Penn State,
24-20, the Orangemen rebounded with
a decisive 29-14 victory over Temple.
They too have their eyes on a bowl
game, and both should be ready to meet
the challenge.

As Coach McPherson sees it Pitt
does have an edge: “Ithink the name
of the game in football is the home
court, and they [Pitt] have the home
court, so that’s a problem for us.”,

McPherson also happens to be a big .

fan of Pitt. “There is no doubt in my
mind they have the second best person-
nel in the East, behind Penn State,”
added McPherson. He also said, “I
think they play a helluva schedule, and
they’re into it every darrm week with
no letup from anybody.”

As for his own team, McPherson is
a bit more reserved. “I think we’re get-
ting better every week from an offen-
sive standpoint,” he said. “I think we
play good defense. Overall, we’re not
a bad football team.”

The way McPherson sees it, Pitt
should be a strong favorite to defeat his
team, but it won’t be that easy. Pitt will
be a five- point favorite, only because
they’re at home and because Syracuse
is 0-7 at Pitt Stadium.

The ﬁnal score will more likely mir-
ror the past two meetings that have seen
Pitt win 13-10 in 1982 on Pat Vian-
court’s memorable 43-yard ﬁeld goal,
and last year’s 13-7 loss at the Carrier
Dome.

Pitt tight end Bobby Lawson and the rest of the Panthers will reach for a ﬁfth victory

this weekend against Syracuse. The game is at Pitt Stadium and kickoff is at 12:10 p.m.

File Photo/The Pitt News

In 1983, nobody evenlknew who No. 2 was. Pat Vian-
court kicked a 43-yard ﬁeld goal in the waning seconds
of the game, and everybody found out in a hurry who

No. 2 was.

Press Box

 

It happened almost two years ago to
the day. Pat Viancourt still remembers
it vividly. After all, that’s the day he
went from a nobody to a somebody on
the Pitt football team.

It was Oct. 29, 1983, and the Pan-
thers were 5-2, preparing for a battle
with Syracuse. Viancourt was the
team’s third-string kicker, behind Eric
Schubert and Snuffy Everett.

Viancourt was just a freshman walk-
on. He had never before appeared in
a Panther football game. But on this
cool fall day in Pittsburgh, he was
destined to turn the Orangemen into
pumpkins.

In one afternoon, he went from never
playing a down of college football to
becoming a hero. With only seconds
remaining in the game, Viancourt drilled a
43-yard ﬁeld goal to lift the Panthers

to a big 13-10 win over Syracuse.

Although the Panthers’ win column
was always twice the length of
Syracuse’s, the Orangemen were rarely
pushovers for Pitt. This game proved
to be no exception.

Pitt grabbed a 7-3 lead early in the
second quarter on a John_ Congemi
touchdown pass. Schubert, however,
was injured on the kickoff following

. Pitt’s touchdown. Everett, though not

so strong of leg as Schubert, boomed
a 45-yard ﬁeld goal, giving Pitt a 10-3
lead. Syracuse rallied to tie the game
near the end of the ﬁrst half.

Everett twice had a chance to put the
Panthers back in the lead in the second
half. But he failed on both occasions,
one being a 27-yard chip shot.

“Coach [Andy] Urbanic told me if
we got another chance to kick a ﬁeld

goal, I would kick,” Viancourt re-
called. “I got nervous, but it was an
excited kind of nervousness. But I’real-
ly didn’t think they’d put me in.”

Pitt was driving late in the game, but
Congemi was intercepted. “I went
from an emotional high to an emotional
low,” Viancourt said. “I felt I may
never get another chance to prove
myself.”

Fortunately for Viancourt, Syracuse
wasn’t satisfied with a tie. The
Orangemen could have run out the
clock. A tie would have been a moral
victory for Syracuse. After all, they
lost to Pitt 12 consecutive years, before
this game.

Troy Benson picked off a Syracuse
pass, however, to give the Panthers a
last hope. Congemi moved the team to
the Orangemen 26-yard line. Only a
few ticks remained on the clock.
“Viancourt!” Urbanic screamed. The
freshman was now in a game situation.
It was his game to win or lose. Many
Pitt players didn’t even know his name.

“I looked at Bill Fralic,” recalled of-
fensive lineman Mike Dorundo, who
was in the huddle before the Viancourt
kick, “and we looked at each other
like, who is this guy? Bill gave him the
old good luck sign and that was it.”

“The funny thing about it,”
remembered Congemi, who was the
holder, “is that I didn’t know Pat was
left-footed. I lined up and he pointed
his thumb the other way.”

Viancourt was ready _to kick when’

Syracuse called a time out to give the
young kicker time to think about it. “I
had never talked to him before,” Con-
gemi said. “I said, ‘Don’t worry about

_ it. Do the best you can.’ I just wanted
to keep talking to him to try to get him
to relax.”

The soccer-style kicker lined up,
went through his two-step approach,
and sent the ball sailing directly be-
tween the goalposts. A wild celebra-
tion at Pitt Stadium followed the
dramatic game-winning kick.
Thousands of elated fans paraded on
the ﬁeld, even going as far as pulling
down the goal post Viancourt’s ﬁeld
goal split.

“I had no feeling directly after-
“ward,” Viancourt said. “But I

remember laying on the bottom of a
pile. Wow. It was so wild. People just
kept piling and piling on.”

“He got smashed,” Dorundo said.
“I could hear him hollering.”

Two years have passed. Ever since
that kick, he has been chosen for
kickoffs. He has boomed kickoffs con-
sistently into end zones for two years.

But Viancourt is still known for his
ﬁeld goal. He has never kicked another
one. The past two years he backed up
Mark Brasco as the placekicker.‘ He
ﬁlled in for the struggling Brasco for
one game this season, but missed on
three ﬁeld goal attempts.

“Before I leave here I want to be
remembered for something else,’ ’ said
Viancourt, who is now a junior. “I let
it haunt me sometimes because people
associate me with that kick.”

How could one surpass the feat of
rising from a third-string, freshman
walk-on in one game with that kick?

“Easy,” said Viancourt, “Kick
another one.”

third game of the season on
Wednesday...see page 20.

By Jim Brueckner

 

While it is true that nothing is

perfect, that should not stop us from.

trying to improve on the flaws. Late-
ly, there has been talk from a few peo-
ple calling for the abolition of profes-
sional boxing in the United States.
With no disrespect intended, I must

say that these people are not consider- V

ing the numerous factors involved.
Boxing, although it has been banned in
Norway and Sweden, will never be
abolished in the United States because
it has become too big a part of
American culture. Therefore, attempt-
ing to ban boxing can only prove to
hurt society more because too much
useless attention is being focused on
abolition, while the true problem (safe-
ty) will never be resolved.

What boxing needs is not abolition.
Instead. a law should be passed that

Anti-boxing activists should concentrate on safety

“What boxing needs is not abolition. Instead, a law should be passed that states
that it is illegal for a boxing match to take place in the United States unless it meets
certain regulations and guidelines. ”

states that it is illegal for a boxing
match to take place in the United States
unless it meets certain regulations and
guidelines.

But ﬁrst, let’s deal with the whole
idea of banning boxing. I would like
to clear the air on several important im-
provisations about the truth which have
been made up by these “ban boxing”
people.

There are people going on record
saying that boxing is getting less and
less safe every year, and that the

number of ring fatalities IS
skyrocketing. In reality, the number of
deaths has been greatly exaggerated.
We have the media to thank for this.

Every once in a while a ﬁghter will
die, and the media goes crazy. We are
bombarded with countless stories and
rehashes about this fighter and his
tragic death. I’m not trying ‘to
downplay this death, but the public,
because of this bombardment, IS sub-
consciously led to believe that during

this time, three or four ﬁghters have _

died, instead of one. As a result, the
public is led to believe that death is a
common occurrence in boxing, which
is far from the truth. In fact, there are
deaths in many sports. Then again,
there are deaths throughout life, in or-
dinary occurrences, that are the results
of far more dangerous events than box-
ing. But we would not even think of
making these actions illegal (driving a
car, for example).

In comparison to other sports, box-
ing is actually one of the safest contact

{wv

Friends don’t let friends drive drunk.

sports in the world. Baseball, football,
horse racing and auto racing all have
more fatalities annually than does box-
ing. Why not ban auto racing? It’s bad
enough that it is far more dangerous to
drive a car on the highway at 55 mph
than it is to put on the gloves and get
into the ring. As far as the sport of auto
racing goes, that’s even worse. We’re
talking about cars going nearly 200
mph at the Indy 500. More racecar
drivers are killed every year than box-
ers. This is not sport! Give me a break!
Tell me that people watch auto racing
to “ooh” and “aah” over the ﬁner
points of driving. Tell me they cheer
when someone goes through a quick pit
stop. We all know it, people watch auto
racing to see spectacular crashes. Why
don’t we renovate the Roman Coliseum
and go back to ﬁghts to the death?

Horse racing is a sport that exists
more for gambling than for any other
reason. I wonder how many people
realize that more jockeys are killed
every year than boxers.

Football and baseball have far more
deaths every year than boxing. But is
anybody doing anything about it? No!
Why? For a very sick and disgusting
reason.

Such “ban boxing” talk started a few
years ago when Ray “Boom Boom”
Mancini knocked out Duk Koo Kim,
and Kim later died because of injuries
suffered in the televised world title
ﬁght. Kim was the No.1 contender in
the world. If there had been two
unknowns in the ring, it wouldn’t have
gotten nearly as much publicity.

Most, in fact, almost all, of the
deaths in football and baseball are of
unknown players, many of whom are
in high school or even younger. But
because of this, no one really cares.
What makes it more tragic for a world-
class athlete to die than an unknown
athlete? They are both human beings.
One is no better than the other. We
have sports that are farmore dangerous
than boxing, but we sit around and do
nothing. It’s sad that these athletes have
to die.

This is not to say that boxing is
perfect, for it is not. But banning it
when there are other sports more in
need of attention is a matter of an unin-
formed public.

There is at least one big change that
I would like to _see come to boxing:
namely, federal legislation.

Ican’t think of one legitimate argu-
ment against thumbless gloves. They
are a brilliant idea and should become
mandatory.

Fighters should be more closely
scrutinized. All of them should carry
a boxing I.D. with their name and pic-
ture on it. This could be used to tap into
a computer that would tell if the ﬁghter
had fought recently and what the out-
come was if he had. It would obvious-
ly be mandatory for all arenas holding
ﬁght cards to report the results. This
would prevent the following
hypothetical situation from occurring:
John Davis is knocked out on June 14
in Miami; he then travels to
Philadelphia where he is again
knocked out on June 22; This has hap-
pened too many times in the past. It is
in these cases that the majority of brain
damage has been done. Too many
times, ﬁghters have entered the ring
when not in the best condition.

Also, there should be more thorough
physicals given before a boxer is
allowed to enter the ring. CAT scans
(brain scans) are of such obvious
beneﬁt that I can’t, for the life of me,
understand why they are not already
mandatory. This could cut down on
fatalities dramatically, if not almost en-
tirely eliminate them. Many of the ring
fatalities have been found to be direct-
ly related to pre-ﬁght injuries that
worsened under very average punish-

dizzy. Throughout these winters, the
Penguins have endured the sort of
misfortune that could move the most
optimistic fan to rebel.

This is a team that falls down a lot.
Sometimes it gets up, and sometimes
it doesn’t. The Penguins fell in the sec-
ond half of last year. They never got
up. After a relatively nice start —
17-19-4 for 38 points — the Pens
digressed into history, going weeks be-
tween victories. They ﬁnished with a

With hard work comes wins. With
wins comes respect. “The biggest
challenge is getting respect, and I think
we started to dovthat last year,” general
manager Eddie Johnston said. “We’re
getting some respect in other rinks, and
we’re getting some respect in our own
city.”

Berry has also seen changes. “We
deﬁnitely have something to build on.
If we didn’t, it would be discourag-
ing.” He then cautiously added, “I

Penguin coach Bob Berry said,"

“There are a lot of positive things. I’ve
seen intensity on the ice, something that
has been non-existent in previous
years. _

Through 10 games the Penguins are
3-5-2 with 8 points. They’re still one
win away from the 500th in their
history. Though it’s too early to see in
which direction the Penguins are head-
ed, Berry doesn’t want the team to
falter as they did last season. “We took

of the players, what happened in the
second half of the season didn’t bother
them that much.”

The Penguins haven’t taken the easy ,

way out this year, except for a game
or two (Hartford and Detroit). They
have played physical, tight-checking
games against Montreal, Philadelphia
and’Quebec, three solid hockey teams.

Terry Ruskowski, acquired from Los

quick remedy for a losing hockey club.
“You have to work hard. Winning

be slow, but the Penguins at long last

The thirst for a winner in Pittsburgh
is unquenchable. The Pirates have
fallen and the Steelers have declined in-
to mediocrity. “No one will ever know
