Drug smuggling, tourist transport replace ‘fishing trade

MICHAEL MASTROIANNI
For The Pitt News

———Editor’s note: Michael Mastroiannil visited
Vieques last spring. This is thesecond part of a
two-part series.

Vieques, off the coast of Puerto Rico, has one
trade that does not appear on employment studies
or customs documents: The import and transit of
illegal drugs, mostly cocaine, has flourished since
naval evacuation. '

Within days of naval evacuation, free use of
the land that once made up Camp Garcia prompted
many former fishermen, with plenty of equipment
but no legal use for it, to begin _,transporting
cocaine shipments across a large part of the
Caribbean Sea. There are no obstructions between
Vieques and Colombia, a leading supplier ‘of
cocaine to American distributors, and all waters
are international and no longer occupied.

Once the drugs arrive in Vieques, which is
technically American soil, they-can be easily and
rapidly transported to Puerto Rico, and then to
Miami, New York and Philadelphia, without going
through customs. _

Juan Franco, captain of “l8 North,” used to
transport tourists on excursions around the island

and as far south as the 18th parallel, for which his _

boat is named. Now, he travels-to the fifth parallel
of the Colombian coasts, a journey of less than a
thousand miles. In the, few short months since

naval evacuation, he has made the trip more than a 9

dozen times, to a large profit on each journey.
I . .

1-8-C)O—GO-GUARD Ext. 195

“Many fishermen were ready to sell their boats
at the lowest prices,” Franco said, “and it was dif-
ficult to find buyers.” Franco, 41, introduced him-
self as the “deposed king of the fishers.”

“I allow myself that title now that I can finally
live like a king,” Franco said. “I only wonder what
happens when the police notice a bunch of out-of-
work fishermen living like emperors in the middle
of the sea.” _

So far, that has not become an issue. The only
federal authorities are now the U.S-Department of
the Interior and the Puerto Rican provincial police,
who patrol part of the old Camp Garcia, and are
not considered a threat to the drug trafficking
trade. , .

Despite claims that drug use is a victimless
crime, this part of the drug smuggling process is
very dangerous. Small rivalries have already
begun among former fishers who are trying to
bring cocaine to the same “safe havens” on

'Vieques’ southern coast. Many believe that even

with the interference of law enforcement, the
problem will only worsen. ‘ .

The employment crisis on Vieques dates back
to the Great Depressionfwhen Vieques was an
exception to the global economic crisis. Playa
Grande, a sugar cane plantation, grew out of the
ruins of the failed plantations around it. In the
1930s, Playa Grande employed more than 12,000
people, the peak population of the island.

— as the island’s inhabitants are called —— were
given bottom dollar for their condemned lands and
houses, and forced to leave the area in one or two
days. According to a Vieques newspaper, in 1947,
expropriations of agricultural land by the Navy

resulted in a 40 percent decrease in municipal-

income. The population, now forced into the cen-
tral section of the island, dropped. e

, Little changed for Vieques until 1964, when
appeals to Washington, D.C., by Puerto Ricans and
Viequenses stopped the expropriation of the south-
ern coast of the island.‘ In 1978, Viequenses fisher-
men were able to stop a North Atlantic Treaty

__Organization naval exercise ‘by blocking vessels

with fishing boats. That same year, Viequenses
reported explosive combustion of drinking water
out of wells on the southern coast, although a 2001
study of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services stated that the validity of these

—-_,claims was uncertain. This same study concluded

In 1941, with the start of World War II, the .

U.S. and Puerto Rican governments allowed the
U.S. Navy to take over the eastern and western

sections of Vieques for a naval base. “Viequenses” '

Glassworker

NICK ULINTZ
Staff Writer V

Tom’ Doner really blows at his job. He
also sucks, and folds under heat. '

He doesn’t sound like a model employ-
ee, but in the ﬁeld of glassworking, a profes-
sional needs these characteristics.

Not everyone can blow, at their job and
still get paid for it.

Doner is the owner and proprietor of a

small glass shop in Butler County that spe-
cializes in hand-blown glass and sculpture. ,

The range of art in Doner’s'shop spans ﬁom
delicate vases and ﬁgurines to thick sculp-
tures and ferocious‘ beasts perched upon
chunky lumps of wood or sparkling geodes.
He also ﬁxes broken pieces and conducts
free demonstrations for the community. V
Tucked inside the comers of his store,
Flame Worked Creations, is a small work-

~ shop where he does demonstrations or cre-

ates more pieces for sale. Plexiglas shields
the cramped comer workshop to_ prevent
stray sparks ‘from ﬁnding their way out.

’ Bunches of brightly colored rods peak out of

their holders like crayons in a box ready to

 their transparent paper. A silver

dragon of a torch arches its neck over the

table, ready to spit blue and orange ﬂames at _

glasstubes and rods.
The rest of the store sparkles from ﬂoor

4 to ceiling wiﬂr a collection‘ of his works and

those of his a fellow tradesmen and
tradeswomen from throughout the country. It
is zoo of factual and ﬁctional animals, radi-
ant jewelry. and vessels of all kinds. '

' His wife, Elaine, usually works the reg-
ister, tending to customers and handling the
business end of the business. Doner got into
glass about nine years ago afterseeing a man

’ at a ﬂea market sculpt glass out of clear rods.

' “After seeing that, I fell in love with

sculpture and realized I wanted to do it,” he _

‘said, walking out and into the parking lot.
‘ Just across ;.the lot is a barn-shaped

-— building that houses the 'fll[J.lI‘e site of his 1

school. The inside has a  torch with
ﬁve stations lining the back wall. The chalk-

boards around the center torch give a formal I
classroom setting for a not-so-fonnal art. .

Doner hopes to open the school by the sum-
mer, if everythingrruns according to plan. ,
“I don’t want to open [the school] until
I know I am ready to teach,” Doner said as
he pointed out thediﬁerent equipment
A Before starting a piece, he draped a thin
latex tube with a mouthpiece around his
neck and puts on safety goggles. The tint of
the lenses ﬁlters out some of the light ﬁorn

the glass while working. He ﬂips a switch,

over ,the ﬂame. It glows a bright orange as he

evenly spreads the ﬂame around the surface.

After heating up a clear rod, causing a

takes heatfor his job, but doesn’t break

to glow at the end, he reaches into a small,
plastic bag and pulls out a small piece of sil-
ver. He places it on the table and smears the
glowing rod into it. 1 ~

“You_want to put. it on heavy because it
burns away,” he said of the silver, as he spun
the rod to create zigzag patterns across the
top. “This is goingto be the scales of the
dragon.” ,

I He adds more oxygen. to sharpen the
ﬂame and begins to_ dab the molten rod onto
the tube. Thin glowing threads are draped
over and around the piece in a constant spin-
ning motion. The glass glows brighter as the
electric spiral wraps tighter and tighter
around the piece.

Doner takes the latex tube from around
his neck and places it~in the cool end of the

tube. He blows slightly.to create the head
and body, deﬁning the mouth by rolling it
around on the block to narrow it down, By
spinning one hand faster than the other and
heating evenly, he straightens out the body.

, “I take my time with it,” he said as the
reﬂection of the ﬂame danced in his goggles.
“I only heat where I want I to move.”

The sculpture receives more color as he
shapes the body and tail of the unborn drag-
on. Trny blobs of neon blue glass are dabbed
onto its back and pulled into small wispy
cones. The round, white balls, covered by
thick ﬂowing blue eyebrows, form two eyes.
Whiskers and horns ﬁnish the face in a
snarling expression, and the whole thing is

THE PITT Nraws

SOFL once rivaled other Pitt paper with breaking news coverage

SOF L, page 1

began writing the paper in the summer of
20()0 for his own amusement. Originally, the
paper was printed on 8.5-by-ll inch com-
puter printouts and was read only by his
friends. .

Early headlines included “Pitt Runs Out
of Money for Petersen Events Center, Builds
Petersen Crack-house Instead” and “White
Pittsburghers Love PNC Park.”

Dow left a copy of the paper at his and
his friends’ favorite hangout, Denny’s Bar,
and soon bar patrons were laughing hysteri-
cally at the paper. *

This gave an idea to Dow’s friend, Kelly
Crawshaw, who graduated from Pitt with a
business management degree.

“I actually thought it would make a
great business idea because it did go over so
well,” Crawshaw said.

In the summer of 2001, Dow and
Crawshaw met with two other class of 1999
alumni — Marc Wisnoski, who would
become Dow’s oo-editor, and Tom Kirby,
who would be the paper’s art director — to
plan the first tabloid-sized, professionally
printed issue of SOFL.

“I remember the ﬁrst time we talked
about doing it,” Kirby said. “We were sitting
around Denny’s [Bar], thinking _up story
ideas.”

“We started meeting as a group to make
a business plan,” Crawshaw said. 0

Although none of the four work for

‘SOFL full-tirne, the paper must pay for its

publishing costs, and it does so the same way
Pittsburgh City Paper, Pulp‘ and The Pitt
News do: It sells advertising space.

Crawshaw, who is SOFL’s business
manager, approached Oakland businesses
about placing ads in the ﬁrst professionally
printed version of the paper.

She presented them with the paper’s tar-
get demographic, its distribution rate and a
list of prices for ads.

“We went at it at a very professional
level,” she said.

Crawshaw also reminded them that,
unlike certain papers that target Pitt students,
SOFL can run advertisements for alcohol.

“All our advertisers have been really
supportive,” Dow said. “We could not have
done it without them, and they are all locally
owned, locally operated businesses, so it is a
community thing.” '

In September 2001, the ﬁrst issue of
SOFL went to print with the front-page story,
“Pitt Screws Oakland,” spooﬁng the univer-
sity buying more and more real estate in the
community. A Photoshop-produced image
of the Cathedral of Learning coated in a giant
condom accompanied the article.

Other early headlines included “Pitt to
Add White Trash Nationality Room” and

an Rick] Sebak Completes ,‘F’ed Up in

In the past two years, word of the paper
has spread quickly — even outside Oakland.

“I will walk around with a [SOFL] T-
slrirt on, all over the city, and people will be
like, ‘I ‘love that paper!” Crawshaw said.

Although the paper has met with a gen-
erally favorable response, some have not
gotten the joke. _

In September 2002, SOFL ran an article
entitled “Disgruntled Asian Tattoo Artist
Inks His Revenge.” The story told of a tattoo
artist who inked “small penis” in Chinese on
a Pitt junior_’s chest instead of the requested
“strength and honor,” and “prostitute” on a
woman’s back instead of “princess.”

“The point was that people get these

- Asian tattoos with symbols, but who are they

to know what they -mean?” Kirby said.
Soon the article was posted on several
tattooing Web sites, and SOFL’s own site got

‘ hundreds of thousands of hits.

“I guess they didn’t read the whole
paper, or if they did, they didn’t realize it was
satirical,” Crawshaw said. “It just spread like
wildﬁre that this guy was out here doing this
to people.” ‘

Another troublesome story ran in
December 2002 under the headline
“Pittsburgh Passion Quarterback Not
Getting Laid,” referring to the city’s National
Women’s Football Association team.

The joke was that the star status of NFL
quarterbacks does not transfer to the NWFA,
but the NWFA wasn’t laughing. They com-

plained to Angelﬁre, the Web service that
was then hosting SOFL’s Internet site, and
the site was closed. The paper is now at
www.soufoaklin.com.

“It sucked, because we actually wanted
to promote the [NWFA], but they took it all
wrongfl Kirby said.

Also, one particularly srrippy publica-
tion became jealous of how close the paper’s
spoofs came to actual. news.

“We scooped The Pitt News one time,”
Wisnoski said.

Last summer, SOFL lampooned Pitt’s
spending habits with the story “Pitt Builds
$74 Million Something or Other.” Two days
later, Pitt announced the construction of a
third Biomedical Tower.

“[The Pitt News] e-mailed us and said,
‘By the way guys, it was $160 million, not
$74 [million],”’ VV1snoski said. “Sony we
scooped you with satire.” ‘ ’

‘Despite "being sometimes misunder-
stood, the Pitt alumni plan to continue/ to
larnpoon South Oakland. V '

Recently, they unveiled the April 2004
issue, which included such headlines as’
“Local Prostitutes Form Labor Union” and
“Asian Tattoo Artist Inks Revenge Behind
Bars,” reporting that the now-famous tattoo
artist has inked“ “I Swallow” and “Salad

' Tosser’ ’ on fellow inmates. The issue is avail-

able at sponsoring businesses such as

Denny’s Bar and Bootleggers and in the"

lobby of Hillrnan Library.

is doubtful about the future of this

“Only a few hours after [the
Viequenses] got in, the place is cov-
ered with trash,” Robertson said on

own this land anytime soon, I’d bet
they"1l\ sell it to hotels and get rich.
All this would be gone.” '

Angel Sanes, a former naval
security guard, believes that outside
politics is the cause of the island’s
woes. '

“Politicians got us into the navy
mess, and now they _have us in a new
mess,” Sanes said. “It seems that all
the politicians come from somewhere’
else.” 1- R — i‘. _

Unfortunately for Sanes and the
many ‘others who have similar

beliefs, outsideinfluences willmost‘ '

likely remain in control of more than
75 percent‘of.Vieques’ lands. The.
U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife
now controls Camp Garcia and the
western section of‘ the island. The
leading proposal for use of the land
is a wildlife reserve.

“I am glad the navy is gone,”
Sanes said, “and that there are no
more bombs. But my father farmed
[the land] as a boy, and his father
died for it. Will my child farm it?’f

senior hooking up students to the defib-
rillator. “The same week we learn how
to use IVs and the [electrocardiogram]
machine, we’re doing it in the hospi-
tals.” By the end of their junior years,
students can find employment as nation-
ally certiﬁed paramedics. According to
Megan Wood, another senior in the pro-

_ gram, about 90 percent -of emergency

medicine students work full-time during
their‘ senior years, while also studying
emergency medicine management and
research techniques. Students in the
program use their degrees to enter pre-
med programs, or to become registered
nurses, physicians’ assistants or medics
for STAT MedEvac, the medical air

- transport service directed by the Center

for Emergency Medicine. STAT

MedEvac also provides medical direc-

tion for the City of Pittsburgh’s EMS.
“Pr'e-med is real intense without a

. lot of clinical experience,” Wood said.

“In this program, I can work full-time

I and finish my degree. My chances‘for

advancement are a lot higher than for
other people in my position.”

Stuart Prunty, a program instructor

“who has served as_a paramedic in both
the United States and Ireland, intro-
duced visitors to one. of the first
“patients” emergencyemedicine students
encounter: the Simulation Mannequin,
or “Sim Man.” Unlike his Resusci-
Annie counterpart, this computer-con-
trolled mannequin has an adjustable
pulse and can Simulate lung sounds.
Pieces of, his skin can be‘ removed and
replaced with injured skin, which even
leaks blood, to simulate the condition of
a trauma patient. Students can insert IVs
and breathing tubes into “Sim Man,”
who can wheeze, cough, and answer
,“yes” or “no” questions. He even has
programs that allow him to simulate‘ a
‘whole series of symptoms thatchange
as the medical student treats him.
“You basically assess him the same

- way you would a patient,”_Prunty said.

ter. The whole idea is to have students
practice knowledge to take. into the
street.”

Like Prunty, many of the students
and instructors come into thevprogram
with experience in other parts of the
country, or overseas. '

“A lot of them have worked at
STAT MedEvac, and a lot of them have
worked as paramedics at some point in
their careers,” Wood said of the instruc-
tors. , '

The program draws people from
Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Korea.
Fireﬁghters from Seoul, South Korea’s
capital, come to train in Pitt’s program.
Talal Al-Kahtani, a student from Saudi

Arabia, explained that Pitt’s program is
well—known overseas, but that students
at Pitt often come across the program
purely by chance.

Students and instructors also return
at varying ages and stages in their
careers to re-enforce their skills and
become familiar with new technology.
For instance, Eric Jenkinson, who was
demonstrating how to insert breathing
tubes, served in the Air Force Reserves.

Similarly, Jennifer Jackson, another
senior in the program, has been a nurse
for three years at Children’s Hospital
and serves as a ﬂight nurse for STAT
MedEvac.

“The only reason the helicopter gets

called ,is because,it’_s the most intense
situation, so they’"re“looking for people
who do well under stress,” she said.
“Most people that see what we do call
us adrenaline junkies.”

Though STAT MedEvac medics
must undergo three years of training as
either critical-care nurses or para-
medics, and must complete a “laundry
list” of certiﬁcations, Jackson said that
she sees ‘her work — helping restore
people to their health and their families
or easing people into death — as a priv-
ilege. '

“There’s a lot of life-changing, eye-
opening experiences if you’re willing to
dig in and get involved,’.’ she said.

TSA’s Do-Not-Fly list denies due process

Airport security just got a lot more
complicated.

The Transportation Security
Administration, with help from federal
law enforcement and intelligence agen-
cies, has compiled a Do-Not-Fly list of

_ people who are not allowed to board

commercial aircraft. There is also a
selectee list, naming people who must
undergo an extensive screening process
before being allowed on ﬂights.

And until authorities tell people
they’re on the list, they can only ﬁnd out
at the airport, and if they are detained,
their long—planned, already-paid-for
ﬂights may depart without them.

The list, like so many other elements

~ of new, improved security, is riddled with

vagaries and secrecy: According tohian

Associated Press report, .“Littler' ... is ,

known about the 1is.ts,fi,nclud'rng nan

qualify to get on or off.” I
The only information available to
the public, it seems,’ is that there is a list,
it deﬁnitely exists and anyone may or
may not be on it. ,. .. r '
This ﬁts with tlie new interpretation

of due process, as «seen through the_

refractory and kaleidoscopic glasses of
the executive branch. " .. ‘ '

The American Civil Liberties Union
is suing the United States Department of
Homeland Security and the TSA, with
seven unnamed plaintiffs, including a

former minister, a member of the mili-

_' tary and a college student, whose names

closely resemble, ‘or are identical to,
those on the No-Fly list, according to a
Reuters report.

Imagine if every Joe Smith who
entered an airport was detained just
because one Joe Smith managed 
somehow -—- to get on the list. And, he
(or she, if itwere a Jo Smith) wouldn’t

know until confronted by airport securi- .
ty. Sure, further background checks, and

calls to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, could clear Joe Srnith’s
name, but that still takes ,time, "and by
then, Smith will have missed his or her
ﬂight. .
Airports are not the proper arenas for

 assigning penalties._”That honor belongs

to the judicial system. If people are being

A . punished’ on suspicion —— which they
many people are on'thern and how they‘ "

shouldn’t be  — that punishment
should come with aﬁswift and fair trial. If
people are to ybepunished, shouldn’t they
be given a day in court rather than simply
blacklisted at. the whim of TSA and
Homeland Security?

_ And why -are "people suspected of
being security. threats not being appre-
hended by the proper authorities? ’

Do-Not-Fly does nothing except
exemplify the executive branch’s new
security regime that seeks to undermine
basic American principles, like due
process and accountability.

Perception and intent: The Tartan’s«*lesson «

Editor’s note: This column contains
themes and terms that may not be suit-
able for all readers.

So I got a hold-of one of The Tartan
A ril Fool’s issues, and let me tell you
2.5  

No.

I’m not going to do any of that stuff
that everyone else has done and jump on

.a newspaper already awash
in shame, which has already
uttered so many apologies
that they’ve begun to lose
meaning. I don’t know why
The Tartan made the deci-
sions they made, and I’m not
going to speculate on some-
thing that’s already hap-
pened.

Instead, I’m going to
write on one of the truly few
subjects on which I have any
authority at all: how hard it is
to put out a paper that actually says what I
you want it to say. .

The Tartan paper’s satire edition is
crude, in my opinion, and it says and
-does things that I would never allow in_
The Pitt News, regardless of date or
tone. That doesn’t mean they’re wrong;
it means that it crosses lines I wouldn’t.
But I’m crazy, and lots of great papers
cross lines I wouldn’t: Souf Oaklin fo’

‘Life, a terriﬁc satire publication, and The
New York Times are two you might

 \

There are words that I don’t let in the
paper, words I find offensive or think
that readers might find offensive. And,
every time, that ‘decision is fought by
some member of my staff who thinks we
should let the word in question into the
paper. I mumble about credibility, I get

, berated for being a tight-ass, etc.

We make tough decisions all the
time. Sometimes the deciding factor is
one of comfort; other times one of
exhaustion and letting our guard down,

 

Greg Heller-LaBelle
Editor in Chief

as The Tartan says occurred. Other
times, we make decisions out of igno-
rance. 

The ﬂag on our April Fool’s edition, _

which normally reads “One of America’s
Great Student Newspapers — since
l906” read instead, “Jack Daniel’s

biggest fans —— after, all, he all we got.” .

That was a reference to three things.

1. We drink too much whiskey.

2. The basketball
team’s slogan, “We All, We
Got,” was not -a good one,
as we said in a previous edi-
torial. ,

3. Our vice provost and
dean of students, also
named Jack Daniel, is the
one person to whom we —
just like any ldthler student
group ———— report, no matter
how much we print about
his ofﬁce’s latest controver-
sies._

To me and every other editor present 4

for production of that issue, our inten-

tions were obvious. We’d been hitting’

the slogan pretty hard, and a drinking
reference is always appreciated, as is any
allusion to the coincidence in names
between the Tennessee sour mash bever-
age and a Pitt vice provost who’d been in
our paper of late. _

So imagine my shock when I’m told
that I’ve run a racist ﬂag, connecting
Daniel i.(the administrator) with an
Ebonics joke. And then it occurs to me

‘that, for all the other things Jack Daniel Y _,'
represents in my mental Rolodex, he’s __

black, also.‘ I ~ ‘

The rest you can work out for your-
self, I’m sure. Daniel, who,.incidentally,
has written extensively on the topic of
black American vernacular, saw none of
the things that were “obvious” to all of
us. Oops._‘-Sorry, Dr. Daniel and everyone
else. -

FCC right to fine Sternfor Blu1npkins,‘other such obscenities

There has been a lot of debate, recently, about
Howard Stern and the Federal Communications
Commission. Desiring to ﬁnally have some retort
other than “I hate Howard Stern; his show is disgust
ing and degrading,” I did a little ‘
research with the help of my favorite I ~-
Internet search engine. - ..

Despite my distaste for Stem, I was
at first skeptical of the FCC’s attempts
to‘-fine him. I’ve read “l984" and
“Fahrenheit 451,” and I’ve taken the
authors’ message to heart: Be wary of
censorship. I am vocal about my anger

    

These guidelines are available for anyone to see
them online at the FCC Web site. ‘Even if Stern was
I blissfully oblivious of the law, ignorance is not ‘an

acceptable legal defense.
But I am far more inclined to believe
that Stern, who once referred to himself as
» being “cruciﬁed by ‘the FCC,” was well
aware of the law and simply ﬂouted it with
his material. And now, when the government
calls him on his bad behavior and rampant
violations of existing laws, he behaves like a_
spoiled 6-year-old.  ; ’ 
Look at poor, little -'m'e“.’ The big, bad

at book banning and the like. I am, after  government‘:is“"picking on me, and it isn’t
all; benefiting from free speech rights F Ginger Mccally- ﬁzir! . - . ‘. ' _
every time I write a column. Columnist And the knee-jerk public react1on- IS

— That said, after a few hours of fol-
lowing \ the historic development of
obscenity laws, I believe that the FCC
was fully justified in fining Stem. 0

FCC uses the three-prong identification system
handed down by a court in 1973, in Miller vs.
California. This landmark case not_ only concluded
that the Constitution does not protect obscene speech,
but it also laid out speciﬁc guidelines by which the
law can identify obscenity. Under this. system, mater-
ial is classiﬁed as obscene if it meets these three
guidelines: , _

An average person, applying contemporary com-
munity standards, must find that the material, as a
whole, appeals to the prurient interest. The material
must depict or describe, in a- patently offensive way,
sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable law.
And the material, taken as a‘ whole, must lack serious

-literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

sympathy for Stern and fear of the FCC. It’s
all too tempting to buy into paranoid propa-

ganda, ‘and believe that the FCC’s-unofficial
slogan is “First Howard Stern, then The World!-”
Maybe it’s just my overwhelming optimism, ,but
I’m hard pressed to believe that just because the FCC
fines a couple of disgusting radio talk show hosts and
a couple of out-of-line celebrities, the world is going
to descend into a “l9_84”-style dystopia. c
Anyone who was paying attention to the law men-
tioned above would realize that it protects against a
censorship hell. The law states that, in order to be
ruled as obscene, “the material, taken as awhole, must
lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value,”
This means that J.D. Salinger, Andy Warhol, Al
Franken and Charles Darwin are safe. I
The best argument that could be made for Stern is
that his show has political value. But 'I’ve seen the

transcripts of the shows in question —- and you can,
too, on thesmokinggun.com -— and there is no chance
that a discussion of “blurnpkins” or about about anal
sex with Paris Hilton_ can qualify. _ , I
The level of fines for broadcasting obscene mate-
rial was originally set back in 1934, in the
Communications Act, Back in the day, the "fines for
obscenity topped off at $10,000. But I think, we can all
‘agree that $10,000 had. a lot more "spending power
then. -
'l‘~he-"“f’é‘lecommunications Act of 1996 reinforced

" I the idea behind the fine. This act, however, did not

account for the dramatic increase in’ celebrity and

broadcasting company income. Only recently .did_the \ ~

FCC raise the ﬁne maximum to a. whopping .$5(_)0,(_)00;

’I"en‘*thousand dollars, Iofveven $2'7,'O00,,‘fis _not
enough to hurt celebrities and broadcasting compa-
nies. It has no real impact; it is a small enough amount
that it can be ignored or justified. Such small fines

’ don’t even make it worth the FCC’s time, money and

energy investment in the process- _ ’

Howard Stern violated the law. The legal details

of violation and fining were available for him, and he
ignored them. It’s only fair that he ‘be punished.
' , The FCC did not mandate that the broadcasting
companies drop Stern. Fines were threatened, and‘ the
-companies decided that it was in their best interest to
stop broadcasting his smut.

The FCC=’s only" mistake is in not enforcing this
sooner. Enforcement must be swift and complete. All

- violators must be fined .forthe_ sake of justice and fair-

‘between soft strumming and - edgy, fast-

However, a change in the band’s sound
shouldn’t be unexpected following the
recent changes in the band’s lineup.
Longtime drummer Jeremiah Green, who
"left the band under mysterious conditions
before the recording of Good News last fall,
has been replaced with Benjamin Weikel.

himself, Dave Chappelle, the master-
mind behind ‘‘Chappelle’s Show,” is
taking his comedy on the road to annoy,
get under peop1e’s skin and cause as
many people to roll on the ﬂoor laugh-
ing as he can. And what would be better
than seeing his scathing, make-fun-of-
everyone-and-everything humor live?

,, I can’t think of life getting any bet-
ter than that. How could it? Chappelle
is a master of movie comedies, televi-
sion and live stand-up. _

Chappelle’s skits on his show are
ﬁlled with plenty of pop culture refer-
ences, and the deconstructs all types of
boundaries with sketches like “The
First Annual Race Draft,” “I .Know

A Black People,” “When Keeping It Real

have described his regular stand-up

But then again, it’s Dave Chappelle, so
it must be amazing. '

A recent episode of “Chappelle’s

hilarious. There is quite possibly no
way he can ever do wrong, and that’s
what keeps the fans coming back for
more of this outrageously funny man.

"Advertisements for Chappelle fea-

haters of his show and openly mocking
them. One letter was from a white male
complaining that white people in gener-

Dave responded by saying that he feels
that white people are shown in positive
light too much on cable television, so
he attempts to “balance” the whole
thing out. Dave holds nothing as sacred,

Help yourself to ashow

full of metal.

This weekend, it’s time for some
metal when Orange County metal-
core maniacs Avenged Sevenfold

team up with My Chemical
Romance, Trustkill’s Nora and
Alexisonfire at Mr. Small’s
Funhouse.

A7X has been making waves in
they metalcore market ever since the
release of their album Sounding the

Seventh Trumpet. It had the cheesi- ,_

ness of ‘80s hair metal, with hard-
core and-emotional vocals scattered
throughout, but never gave up any
brutality. This album was wicked
heavy, and with good reason. The
song “Darkness Surrounding”
seemed to be the big hit that
spawned it all, from their simple
days as mp3.com metalheads to
their signing with European label
Goodlife Recordings,nuntil they
finally hit the nail on’ the head by
signing to Hopeless Records. With
plenty of good, 01’ American pro-
motion, the band found itself get-

ting offers to play festivals, and‘

touring around the country with
well-known bands in the scene.
Waking the Fallen was released
mid-2003, andihas put them on the

Mmm, tasty

map. Hell, they-were even featured
in EA Sports’ “Madden 2004” and
“NHL 2004.”

My Chemical Romance has a -

“power punk” sound. Alexisonfire
seems to have latched onto mixing
melody with an edge. They don’t
completely give in to emo sound, as
reviews have insinuated, but it can

rbe seen __as,_.suc:h. Both of these

bands’ work has not gone unnoticed
in the music scene, . as they are

becoming bigger names with each g_

and every tour. But another band to
keep an eye out for is Trustkill’s
Nora.

The band was originally given

major props for their split with the V‘

Dillinger Escape Plan a few years
ago. Their connections with the
New Jersey mathcore heroes
allowed them to move on to bigger
and better things. They offered‘ a
Slayer-esque approach to metal" with
Neverendingyouline, an  that was
just as brutal as it was amazing.
Dreamers and Deadmén, their full-
length offering of 2003, was a major
hit with metal and hardcore fans

No clinic needed to experience The Methadones

The Methadones have been a work in
the making. First formed in 1993 by Dan
Schaferas one of side projects of the bands
Screeching Weasel, The Riverdales, The

Mopes and Sludgeworth, they
were often put on the back bum-
er because of his many other
projects. They seemed to be just
a fun garage band — they had no
label and few sporadic shows.
The band slowly faded
away, but in 1999, Schafer
decided to try again with The
Methadones. He started up The
Methadones again with fellow
Mopes B-Face and Dan Lurnley.

Having other obligations, both _ '

members left the band and left
Schafer with 11 songs to release
and no band to play with. But
soon he ended up getting some
friends from"Chicago —— Pete
Mittler on bass, and Mike Byme
(formerly of the Vindictives) on
guitar and Mike Soucy from the
Washington, D.C., punk scene
on drums — to help out.

)7Vith a steady lineup and no
other projects in the way, The
Methadones finally released Ill
At Ease in the summer of 2002.
They toured the country with
signiﬁcant punk bands like Anti-
Flag, the Misﬁts and The

Unseen. They continued touring and Career Objectives is an explosion of

recorded even more songs, which lead to melodic pop punk power anthems. The
the May 2003 release of Career
Objectives.

album makes it clear that Schafer has
matured.

Songs like “Ammunition” and “Say
Goodbye to Your Generation” are feverish-
ly catchy. Schafer’s songwriting also deals
with real topics of his lifestyle, like the

song “Premature Life Crisis” in
which he sings, “I was refusing
to grow up/paving the road to
Hell but still I lived according to
my will/I thought of a career
objective/and gained a new per-
speclive/playing punk rock’s a

to be an autobiographical song,

Who are The Rasmus? Just ask
someone from Finland. The Finns
seemed to have caught on to them in
1999 and 2000, when they awarded
them four Finnish Grammys. Their
breakthrough record has gone plat-'
inum and their new release, Dead
Letters, is one of the first records they
are trying to promote in the United
States. Their incredibly infectious
rock sounds are something that could
easily have done the same in the
United States. _

g In 1996, they released their first
album, P\eep, which quickly went
gold. Since then, they have been tak-
ing the European music scene by
storm, releasing another‘ album,
Playboys, in 1997, which also instant-
ly went gold. They switched, record
labels and released Into in 2001,
which was greeted with the same

Opening-day win continues Pirates’ annual tease

 wew

   
 

Another year, another Pirates
opening-day win.

For the second straight year, a
new-look Bucco baseball club has
started out its season on a positive
note, as Kip Wells pitched six
shutout innings on Monday to lead
the Pirates to a 2-1 victory at home
over the Phillies.

Last season, the Pirates went on
the road to christen Cincinnati’s
brand new home, Great American
Ballpark, with a 10-1 drubbing of the
Reds.

The Pirates are no strangers to
fast starts under Lloyd McC1endon.
In 2002, the Bucs stumbled out of the
gates in their opener against the Mets
before rebounding to win their next
five contests.

Back-to-back three-game sweeps

   

of the Brewers and the Phillies in.

mid-April earned the Pirates a 12-5
record, good for first place in the
National League Central Division.
After opening up with a 10-run
effort in last year’s win against
Cincinnati, the Pirates didn’t look
back offensively —for about a week.
, The Buccoes scored seven runs
in each of their next two games
against the Reds, sweeping that

series, and scored nine runs in their

next game at Philadelphia, taking
two—of-three against their cross—state
foes. The result: a 5-1 record and,
you guessed it, first place-in the NL
Central.

Now, with a 2-1 victory under .

their belts thanks to a strong. open-
ing-day start by Wells, it looks like
the Buccoes_ are ready to get back to
playing small ball.

If Monday’s game is any indica-
tion, good defense and a solid
bullpen could take this team far, and
one can’t help but think:

Why the teasing?

The Piratesineed to stop winning
right‘ away. We all know that, come
May, they will be out of the race,
and, come_ the trade deadline, they

will be a Triple-A ball club.

_ I am so tired of hearing people
talk ‘about the Bucs for two weeks
until they ultimately collapse and
lose 14 out of 19. It happened two
years ago, it happened last year, and
it’s definitely going to happen again,
as this year’s Pirates manifestation
has even less talent than Pittsburgh’s
last two clubs.

The Pirates are like that girl in
your class who is completely out ,of
your league. You know this already
on day one, but she gives you just
enough ﬂirty smiles - and pointless
small conversations ‘to keep you
interested. I v

By midterms, she tires of toying,
and you end up seeing her on a

Thursday night with a guy who could.

break you in half with one hand.

Or, maybe they don’t purposeful-
ly tease. Maybe they are too naive to
realize just how bad they are, and
that enables them to steal some‘vic-
tories early on. I

Maybe they are just like the too-
dumb-to-be-scared movie characters,
in the tradition of Navin R. Johnson
in The Jerk and Pee—Wee Herman,
who come out on top because of their

- ignorance.

In any case, this neo-Bucco tradi-
tion of creating a good outlook for
what will ultimately be a disastrous
season needs to end now.

It is unbearable for Pirates fans
or even those with a casual interest in

the Bucs, and we can all feel a lot

safer knowing that the Pirates. will

have no chance of making the post-

season.

' [So why wait? I propose that the
Buccoes lose their next 10 in a row,
so that we can all relax and focus on
the NBA playoffs and the NFL draft,
_as we should.

Then we"can enjoy another short,
humid Pittsburgh summer of eating

(U-WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind. -
Ryan Grant went from being the sev-
enth back in Notre Dame history to
rush for 1,000 yards in a season on a
10-3 Notre Dame team to standing in
the shadows of Julius Jones and see-
ing the Irish fall to 5-7..

It’s not something he wants to
remember anytime soon. I

“I didn’t play as well as I'd like
to, but that’s in the past,” Grant said.
“We have to look forward and get
things together so we can be the best
team we can be.” .

Grant began 2003 as the starter,
and the Irish looked to have a two-
back system of Grant and Jones to

punish opposing defenses for 60,

minutes.
But Grant wasn’t able to build
off that success from 2002, and

Jones became the feature back for
‘ the Irish. Despite that role reversal,

Grant and Jones didn’t have any ten-

sion between them.
In fact, the duo became closer in
2003 than they did in 2001 when

Grant was a heralded freshman from“

Nyack, N.Y., and Jones struggled as
a junior with the Irish.

“I think we both learned a lot
from each other bouncing things off
each other. He did a great job last
year and was a great back,” Grant
said. “I was glad to be able to learn
from him and be around him. I was
glad to be able to play with him, and
I think he was glad, to play with me.”

Grant learned from watching
Jones what he needs to do to become
the back fans, the coaching staff and
Grant know he can become. He has
to be patient to let the offensive line

open holes, but once those holes

open, the running back has to hit the
hole at top speed. 

That’s something he didn’t do
last season. Grant would either
plunge straight into the offensive

line before the hole developed or not

be aggressive ‘enough to burst

through the hole once it opened.
Improving that decision-making
was a major goal in the winter and is

‘at-’ocus this spring;

“The main thing was his acceler-
ation after the cut,” Notre Dame run-
ning backs coach Buzz Preston said.
“We had to get in [during the offsea-
son] and look at the film. You can
look at the things they did well and
didn’t do well. It gives them a
chance to get a little more mentally
sharp.”

In the hole, Grant knows he has
to break that first tackle and pick up
theextra yards to maintain drives.
Grant worked hard in the offseason
doing drills to increase his agility,
and ran track to increase his speed.

But the coaches are looking to
Grant to not only improve his pro-
duction, but also become a leader for
the 2004 team. The dedication Grant
has shown since the end of the 2003

‘season is an indication’ he’s ready to»
accept that role a_'s'o_ne of the few",

seniors on the offense.

J OE MARCHILENA/SPORTS EDITOR

Notre Dame running back Ryan Grant (No. 4) gets stopped by the Pitt defense during the 2002 season. Grant, who lost his starting job to Julius Jones in 2003, ran for
87 yards in the Fighting Irish’s 20-17 win over the Panthers last year at Heinz Field. The two teams will meet this season at Notre Dame.

Grant looks to put disappointing season behind him

MA'I'I‘ LOZAR
The Observer (U. Notre Dame)

“I think, with Ryan being a
senior, with two years of experience,
you are going to ask and demand [a
lot] out of a young man like that,”
Notre Dame offensive coordinator
Bill Diedrick said? “You really ask
him to be a leader by example both

on and off the field, which I think.

Ryan has done a really good job in
the offseason. He is trying extremely
hard to be a leader on the field.”

Grant can show that leadership
on the field by bouncing back from a
disappointing 2003 season and tak-
ing his game to a level beyond what
he showed in 2002.

With an entire offense that has
gained invaluable‘ experience last
year, the opportunity is there for
Grant not to watch from the side-
lines, but to have a year like Jones.

“In spring ball, everyone is
going to make mistakes, but we are

going to grow and get better as .
{Grant said- --
“What we are just l'ooki”ng“after"is7.
