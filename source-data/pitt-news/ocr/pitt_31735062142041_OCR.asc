Deadlock Again Seen
lmminent ln SFA

By ABE BLUESTONE

With both Fraternity and Independent leaders agreed that the
present SFA deadlockpis most undesirable, the probabilities are, as this
article is written, that the scheduled meeting tonight will be postponed
to a later date to permit the attendance of the faculty members who
could not’ be present tonight and to allow some plan for breaking the tie

to beworked out. ,

When asked by a News staff
president Gus Wilde said that he
did not care to have another meet-
ing under the present 16-16 dead-
lock. Independent leader Aldo Icar-
di said that “the meeting should
not be held under the same circum-
stances.”

Ed Tait, former president of
SFA, who will chairman tonight’s
meeting, if there is one, suggested
that an impartial person be ap-
pointed temporary chairman by the
executive committee until a presi-
dent is elected. This, of course,
would mean that a non-member
would have the deciding vote if the
faculty refused to participate, and
it will certainly be diffffcult for the
executive committee to ﬁnd a per-
son both sides could trust to be im-
partial.

Of course, the tie could be very
easily broken by the faculty vote,
but if the meeting is held tonight,
it is certain that seven out of the
ten will not attend. Acting Dean of
Men, Theodore W. Biddle called the
Chancellor and found that Dr. Bow-
man had appointed the ten faculty
members who had served last year,

i to continue for the current academic

year. Thus their voting powers
were still good. Mr. Biddle then
contacted these persons, and found

‘ that three were out of the assembly

79 Students Accepted

member, fraternity candidate for

because of reasons ranging from a
transfer to Northwestern Univer-
sity to assumption of duties in the
armed services.

Four other teachers, who are still
active members cannot possibly be
present tonight. This leaves only
three faculty votes to be accounted
for, and Mr. Biddle was not able to
get in touch with these three in-.
structors.

If SFA is to continue to act as
the student governmental body, and
if it intends to get things accom-
plished, one thing is certain.
Straight party line voting, as ex-
empliﬁed by the presidential dead-
lock will have to go. Regardless of
any arguments, the student mem-
bers of SFA must keep the affairs
of the body in their hands, and not
leave every decision to be made on
the basis of faculty opinion.

What is to be done no one knows.
It appears now that the Independ-
ents, embittered by the recent ex-
ecutive committee appointments,
will be a long time in trusting the

.Fraternities; on the other hand,

Fraternities wary because of In-
dependent attempts to swing fra-
ternity votes for Icardi by promises
of patronage, will be equally dis-
trustful.

F or Advanced ROTC

Passing their physical examina-
tions recently, 79 sophomores to-
day were designated as having
qualiﬁed for the advanced ROTC
course to ﬁll the vacancies of de-
parting seniors. ,

According to Colonel Edward L.
Kelly, professor of military science
and tactics, they were selected
from among nearly 200 applicants,
who were listed in numerical order
according to their military science
grades, military aptitude and rank,
and scholastic standing, in addition
to the physical requirements.

Enlistment for ROTC students in
the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps,
except for the Medical Corps, will
be made a prerequisite for enroll-
ment for the advanced course. The
79 men accepted will be required to
sign provisional contracts with the
government, certifying their en-4
listment, between May 10 and 15.

All ROTC men will be required
to attend the summer session un-
less it is impossible for them to do
so. If unable to attend, a letter to
the Colonel will be necessary.

In addition to the students ac-
cepted for the advance course, 48
others have been conditionally
qualiﬁed and will be accepted if the
present quota is increased. A mili-
tary order has advised these men

not to take any action which would

disqualify them for the advanced
course until July 1, for “there are
indications that the quota may be
increased to permit the acceptance
of a number of these candidates."

WSGA Needs
Pittiquette Editor
Who Has Ideas

Next year it must be different.

That is the motto adopted by the
WSGA executive committee as the
criteria for Pittiquette scripts. And
an editor is needed.

Pittiquette, annual publication
instructing freshman‘ women in
Pitt etiquette, has been just about
the same for too many years now.
Sometimes written in prose, some-
times in poetry, the ideas have not
been changed one bit. Even the stick
ﬁgures used to illustrate the book-

let have been used time and time
again.

Next year it must be different.

Betty Haldeman, president of
WSGA; stated that originality will
be considered most importantwhen
the new editor is selected.

If you have any ideas about h-ow
it can be changed, or if you would
like to work on the publication
(either to write or to draw) make
an outline of your ideas and present
them to WSGA executive commit-
tee Monday at 12:30 o'clock.

Three Courses

To Be Offered

At Camp Pitt   

Camp Pitt, the University’s an-
nual outdoor school for profession-
al educators, will open June 7 and
run through June 27. Two courses
in physical education and one in
nature study are oﬁered.

Courses in physical education. in-
clude recreation for _ wartlme
groups, and camp counseling. Four
credits are given for each. Nature
study includes combined courses in
biology.

. A feature of the camp this year
will be a recreation clinic open to
all camping and recreation leaders.
For one of the conferences an out-
standing national leader in camp-

ing and recreation is scheduled to ‘

appear.

The camp, which is designed to
offer professional training on a col-
lege level and in a camp setting, is
located in the Laurel Mountain
range, near Somerset.

Courses in physical education are
designed for experienced persons,
while the nature study classes will
be divided into those for beginners
and advanced groups.

The course in recreation for war-
time groups consists of roundtable
discussions on the problems faced
today by schools, colleges, commu-
nities, industries, and the home.

Camp counseling will include
theory and practical work in camp-
craft, handcraft, nature study,
camp music, and aquatics or first
aid, with methods of dealing with
children in camp groups and as in-
dividuals being stressed.

The nature study program has
been planned to aid the student in
identifying things frequently found
around the camp. These include wild
ﬂowers, trees, ferns, insects, birds,
and the star constellations.

Conducting the courses will be a
faculty of seven members, with
Cecil W. Morgan, professor of
physical education, as camp direct-
or. Other faculty members will be
Gertrude R. Mann, lecturer in music
and- physical education; John F.
Lewis, lecturer in nature study;
Karl H. Oermann, instructor in
camp aquatics and waterfront safe-
ty; Estelle M. Wilson, camp music
and accompianist; Edna V. Tarr,
instructor in handcraft, and Philip
Walker, instructor in campcraft.

Applications for registration for
any of the coursesat Camp Pitt are
being taken now at the office of the
Registrar.

All candidates for the Pitt
News editorial staff will meet to-
day in 825 Cathedral at 3:30
o'clock. All men are eligible, and
women sophomores, juniors and
seniors may apply.

Pitt B....ic....... Tonight

Drive Averages
$1000 Weekly,
Continues Today

Alpha Epsilon Phi, women’s so-
cial fraternity, hoping to break all
records, today will take charge of
the battleship war stamp drive.

The girls, wearing special identi-
ﬁcation, will be aided by the mem-
bers of the battleship drive sales
staff.

The highest record so far was
reached on MacArthur Day when
a total of $3,216.25 worth of
stamps and bonds were sold.

In this campaign, Pitt competed
with 274 other universities and
collges all over the country.

Although the ‘committee hasn't
heard from the Michigan College
of Mining and Technology, the be-
ginners of the plan, on the outcome
of the MacArthur Day campaign,
Richard Hartz, BA43, chairman of
the‘auditing committee, says that
he feels sure that we rank among
the highest.

Total sales have equaled
$10,082.50.

Going into the ﬁnal run, the
drive has averaged $1,000 each
week. The campaign will come to
a close in four weeks.

Plans had previously been made
to extend the campaign to the com-
plete campus, but due to the accel-
erated program these plans will be
postponed until the fall semester.

Faculty A members can have
stamps or bonds delivered to their
offices by contacting the Dean of
Men’s Office.

The entire concert will be broad-
cast over the WWSW frequency
modulation system.

Commenting on the band’s per-
formance during the tour and on
difffferent programs during the
year,
year’s organization composed of 60
musicians selected from the Pitt
marching band is the “best con-
cert band I’ve ever directed."

Two soloists and a guest con-
ductor will be on the program which
includes popular, classical, and
military selections.

Professor M. S. Rocereto, direct-
or emeritus of the University band
and orchestra, will direct “Our
Fighting Men,” his own composi-
tion which he wrote during the last
war.

A trombone solo “The Message"-'

by Brooks, ,,will be played by Orva
Lee Ice, Jr., C42. Thomas Pitzer,
E44, a cornetist, will play “The
Dedutante” by Clark. '

James Hunter BA42, student di-

rector, will direct the band’s sig-
nature, John Philip Sousa’s ‘sphe-

Thunderer.”
The first part of the program for
the concert includes: “The Thun-
derer,” “Concert Overture" by

Hadley; “Triumphal March from,

Peter and the Wolf,” Prokofieﬂg
“A Street Scene," Newman; “The

Message," Brooks; and the “Chil-

dren's March" by Goldman.

“Our Fighting Men” will begin
the second part of the program fol-
lowed by Overture to “Snow
White,” by Leidzen; “The Debu-
tante;” “City of Dreams,” Seiszyn-
ski; “Pavanne,” Gould; the ﬁnale
from the symphony “From the New
World,” Dvorak; and “Hail to Pitt,”
by Taylor. “The Star Spangled
Banner” will complete the concert.

Many encores, mostly on the mili-
tary theme, are available and prob-
ably will be used.

On the tour the band visited Em-
porium, Bradford, Cambridge

Springs, Meadville, Karns City, and -

Vandergrift and played to 9. total
audience of. over 5,000 people.

Dentistry and Pharmacy Schools
Begin Summer Sessions for Duration

Under pressure of the‘ war ef-
fort, the Schools of Pharmacy and
Dentistry have inaugurated sum-
mer schedules for the duration of
the war while the Bureau for Re-
tail Training has started summer
classes for teachers.

Leaving room only for a few
days vacation, the School of Phar-
‘macy will start a sixteen weeks
course June 8th. This course will
not be compulsory, but juniors or
seniors who do not attend will have
to wait until a later time before
they can continue with their
studies.

Sophomores who do not attend
will be held up until February be-
fore they can begin class. Fresh-
men will not be admitted until Sep
tember. *

The School of Pharmacy is shift-
ing from a two semester to a three

semester year, ‘.f continue, 

5

on a three semester basis until the
end of the emergency.

Unlike other schools of the Uni-
versity, the courses offered by the
School of Pharmacy are given in
consecutive order, and it is im-
possible to change the sequence of
courses or to operate on any basis
other than a regular sixteen week
course, according to C. Leonard
O'Connell, dean of the School of
Pharmacy.

Because of the rigid curriculum
and entrance requirements, a quick-
er pace is impossible unless the
high schools also accelerate their
courses, Dean O’Connell said.

At the School of Dentistry, 3
three semester year will also go
into operation. All undergraduates
except entering freshmen will reg-
ister the ﬁrsl: week of June while
freshmen “will start  on the,

This three semester year will be
continued as long as the war lasts
regardless of any difﬁculties that
may arise, Dr. H. Edmund Friesell,
dean of the School of Pharmacy,
said. After the war, however, the
normal two semester year will be
resumed.

Priorities and shortages have not
bothered the School of Dentistry
yet, he said. They have enough sup-
plies to last at least a year.

The summer courses offered by
the Bureau of Retail Training are
not a part of an accelerated, three
semester year but are courses de-
signed exclusively for teachers and
will be offered in two separate
summer session».

An accelerated schedule is im-
possible for the regular students
of the Bureau of Retail Training

since their summers are

Editor, the Pitt News:

It is very gratifying to know that
the Pitt News has formally an-_
nounced its endorsement of the
creation of a mixed volunteer di-
vision in the army as proposed by
the Council Against Intolerance in -

America.
In discussing the proposal with

several, students, I—have found a_
great‘ amount of enthusiasm. ‘My-

hope is that this verbal approval

will result in a written endorse-C

ment. The News published a blank
_ for that purpose. These blanks,

when ﬁlled, may be returned to‘

the News office or sent directly to

_The News should further be con-
gratulated for its publication,‘ on
many racial conﬂicts that have

‘the many articles that have been

written by Negro students or those‘

concerning them.

 ELAINE KAHN

With rallies in the seventh and eighth innings that net-
ted them seven runs, the Panthers ‘came from behind to score
a‘12 to 8 triumph over West Virginia in the first of their two
game series at the Stadium.Monday. This marked the second
straight win for the Panthers and the ﬁfth consecutive loss

for the Mountaineers.

Ed Vitunac, who pitched his ﬁrst game for the Panthers,
turned in a creditable job despite the fact that he allowed ten

hits and eight runs. All eight of the
Mountaineer runs came in the ﬁrst
and third innings and were scored
on a total of ﬁve hits, four errors,
a passed ball, and a hit batsman.
After that Vitunac was well nigh
invincible, allowing but five scat-
tered hits over the next six in-
nings. ‘
West Virginia took the lead in
the ‘very ﬁrst inning, scoring three
runs, but Pitt came. right back in
their half to tie it up three and
three. George Jacobs sent a triple
to left. Fisher then singled to send
‘him home. Wilk followed through
with another single that sent Fish-
er to second. -
With Brown at bat, Fisher and
Wilk executed a double steal. Brown
struck out, but Vaiksnor singled to
right scoring Fisher and Wilk with
the runs that tied the game. Kos-
tenbauder ﬂied out to end the inn-
ing.
lt‘didn’t take West Virginia long,
however, to break the deadlock
with a ﬁve run rally in the third
that put despair in the hearts of
the Pitt rooters and seemed an omi-
nous forecast of things to come.
 the Panthers eased back into

the ball game with one run’ in the
ﬁfth, and managed to tie things up
again, 8-8, with three runs in the
seventh. ,

That’s the way things stood in
the Pitt half of the eighth inning
when, with two men gone the Pan-
thers »put on a four run barrage
that won the game. Kostenbauder
tapped out from sh_ort to ﬁrst. Zu-
kas drew a base on balls and Vi-
tunac sacriﬁced him’ to second.

George Jacobs then" came through
with his third hit of the day, a
double into the right ﬁeld stands,
that scored‘Zukas with the run that
broke the tie. Fisher sent a single
to left that scored Jacobs, and Joe
Wilk,
batting, drove a home run to left
ﬁeld that rolled all the way to the
gate, sending Fisher home ahead
of him with the twelfth and ﬁnal
Pitt tally.

Big guns of the Panther attack
were the ﬁrst three men in the bat-
ting order, Jacobs, Fisher, and Wilk
who chipped in with three hits
apiece. Johnny Brown, batting in
the cleanup position produced two
hits, and John Vaiksnor had one.

Panther ,Tracl<men Drill
For lncliana Dual Meet

Fresh from their Penn Relays
championship, Indiana University

‘will arive in town next Saturday

afternoon to battle the Panther cin-
dermen in the first outdoor dual

track meet of the season.

Unlike other years, Coach Carl
Olson does not have a well-round-
ed team, for the loss of IC4-A title-
holder Jim Elliott in the javelin
toss, Bill Cooper in the hurdles,

‘and “Red” Jessup in the pole vault
by draft will hurt him consider-
" ably.

Last year the Hoosiers led by
quarter-miler Campbell Kane nosed
out the local squad, 65 1/3——65 2/3,
and the visitors have practically

_ the same outﬁt.

Indiana’s strength will be found
essentially in the long distant runs,
the mile, two-mile, and the relays,
whereas the Panther contingent will
rely on the sprints and hurdles.

in Bill Carter, Olson has prac-
tically clinched the 100-yard dash,
the 220-yard dash, and the broad

I jump, while ‘ “Happy” Stickel
should not have too much trouble

ter in the dashes and copping a

trated by the Middies, and the Pan-
thers came home on the short "end
of a 7‘/é-1'1/2 score. '
Panther points were scored by
Bill Kramer, playing number three‘,
and by Kramer and Harry Walkin-
shaw, who split the best‘bal'l point
in the second best ball match.
The results: Simpson, Pitt, was
defeated, 3 and 2; Bilowich, Pitt,
was defeated, 6 and 5; Navy won
best ball; Kramer, Pitt, won, 3 and
1; Walkinshaw, Pitt, was defeated,
3 and 1; Pitt and Navy split best

ball; Garbore, Pitt, was defeated, ,

7 and 6; Thurbon, Pitt, was defeat-
ed, 6 and 5. Navy won best ball.
Incidentally, an indication of the
strength of the Navy team may be
gained from the fact that their

“Dusty” Rhoades will be the on
ly Panther in the pole vault event,
and should place either one, two.

But, unfortunately, from here on’

in the Blue and Gold wearers are
in for a bad time. A very bad time.

Pitt has no Kane. Pitt has no
Mitchell. Pitt doesn’t have a Penn
Relays ‘two-mile quartet. But it
should be interesting to watch the
outcome since there is a possibility
that Olson will pull something out
of the hat next Saturday and send
the Hoosiers back home with their
ﬁrst defeat of the season.

Wilde Named a
New Varsity
Swim Captain

Coach Ben Gra-
dy announced ear-
ly thisweek that -
Gus Wilde, crack
sprinter, will cap- ;
tain the swim _~
ming team next
year.

The announce-
ment came the
(lay before the
graduation of for- .
mer captain Herb Cosgrove. Wilde,
who was a City champion at Pitts-
burgh’s South High, was pronounc-
ed the 1ogica.l choice-by Grady be-
cause of his outstanding work this
past season. . .

Besides anchoring the extremely
successful 440 and 880-yard relay
teams, the new captain also won

many ﬁrst place medals in the 100

and 220-yard dashes.

Pitt’s record of ﬁve wins, one
loss, and one tie,- along with the
second place scored in the Eastern
Collegiate Swimming Association
meet, all against the very best com-
petition available, was due largely
to Wilde’s ‘performances.

Stetler Brilliant As Blues
Trounce Whites ln Finale 6

Three touchdowns scored by half-
back Jack Stetler last Saturday af-
ternoon in the Blue and White in-
tra-squad gridiron clash were
enough to give the -Blues the game,
20-0. It was the second straight tri-

- umph of the ﬁrst team over th gre-

serves in the current spring prac-
ticc season.

Two changes in the regulars
lineupididn’t hurt their playing as
they came through with two touch-
downs more than they scored in
the first intra-squad game. The
changes brought Norman Gestner
and Bill Kyle to the end posts of

the first string eleven.

Gestner starred in the game play-
ed last week when he handled one
of the terminals for the Whites. His
heads-up playing moved him up to
the Blues. A

Kyle is a transfer from Notre
Dame where he was a member of

the freshman squad. Up to last
Saturday he hadn’t been in the

starting lineup of either the Blu
or White team. Apparently h
showed enough improvement dur
ing the past week to rate a starti_
job with the regular squad.

Like the first game, last Satur
day’s intra-squad dual was a rough
spirited, “dog eat dog” affair. Onl
one of Stetler-’s touchdown run
came from ‘short clashes, this on
coming early in the opening perio
from the three yard line. The sec
ond was a 25 yard gallop througlv
tackle ,and the ﬁnal tally from a
85 yard run around end.

This is the ﬁnal week‘ of spring
practice for the Blue and Gold grid
ders. At the end of theweek the
squad will disband for the summe
and will then get together -again
few weeks before the opening of th

fall semester. _, r

} Last year, on 39 different college campuses, men were asked for can-

did opinions about clothing styles. This poll, conducted by The Saturday *

Evening Post, is being repeated this year _for more than reasons of fash- '
~ ion. It should have important usefulness in the national conservation of

cloth and other materials.

~ Manufacturers and retailers want A to know exactly what kind of
clothing college men like best—-what they ﬁnd most practical. Govern-
ment regulations about clothing make it vital to get such facts in advance.

Maybe you were one of the 4,179 college men who helped provide
the information last year. Maybe you also saw the Post Portfolio of Col-
lege Styles in your favorite store when you bought clothes I
made buying simpler for a good many men. ' e

The 2nd Annual Post‘ Poll of College Styles will be made
through cooperation of the PITT N EWS

Results will again be available to you in leading stores this fall. When
your local reporter asks you for information, your answers will be
appreciated.
