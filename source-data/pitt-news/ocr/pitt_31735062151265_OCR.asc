Today is the last day on

the annual poetry reading con-
test will be held, according to
an announcement made by
Professor W... L. Parrish, head
of the public speaking depart-
ment.

The ﬁnal contest will be held

Hall.

Entrants will be expected to
read forty or ﬁfty lines of good
poetry. Professor Percival
Hunt, head of the English de-
partment, will award a volume
of the Oxford Book of English
Verse to the winner. Last
year's winner was Dorothy

Council Heads
Are Selected

Interfraternity Chairmen
For 1932-33 Named

 

Nominations for the chairman-
ships of the athletic, social and
rushing committees of Interfrater-
nity Council for next year were
made last Tuesday evening at the
regular meeting of the council at
the Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity
house. -

The executive committee of the
council will meet early next semes-
ter and select the chairmen from
the group which was nominated:
Morris Harris, Phi Epsilon Pi;
Leroy Lewis, Phi Gamma Delta;

William Young, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon; Richard Wettach, Kappa Sig-
ma; Peter Pingetore, Alpha Phi
Delta; Edward McBride, Phi
Kappa; Wayne Weaver, Theta
Delta Psi; Harlow White, Phi
Delta Theta; Leroy Erickson, Delta
Tau Delta; and Charles Hugus,
Theta Delta Psi.

The council is considering re-
organizing its program next year.
Instead of buying cups for the fra-
ternities winning out in different
sports it is thinking of establish-
ing‘ an “Intramural Program." A
certain number of points will be
given to the fraternity coming in
first, second and third in any event
sponsored by the council. Then,
at the end of the semester, the
fraternity having the most number
of points will get one cup. Frater-
nities coming in second and third
also receive cups. This will elimi-
nate the necessity of buying cups
for the winning fraternities in each
event and also equalize the compe-
tition among all the fraternities.

The council is also considering
sponsoring an “Inter-fraternity
Sing" next year at which the fra-
ternities will have certain mem-
bers represent them at the meet-
ing and have them sing the fra-
ternity songs. The fraternity
whose songs will be judged best
will be adequatelyyrewarded.

On Customs

Eight Activities Install
Officers Monday

 

 

At the installation of cfficers"of
the major women's campus organ-
izations next Monday evening in
Heinz House, members of W. S. G.
A. will vote on the important
change in the organization of cus-
toms enforcement for next year;
that of having juniors as well as
sophomores serve on the commit-
tee. »
Under the new plan each year
a number of the members of cus-
toms committee will be held over
to serve with the incoming sopho-
mores on the next year's commit-
tee. The majority however, will
consist of sophomores. In addition
the chairman of customs will be
chosen by the executive committee
- of W. S. G. A., and will be a jun-
ior.

The advantages of this system
are listed by W. S. G. A. heads. In
the first place, junior women hav-
ing had more acquaintance with
Pitt traditions, will have a broader
outlook on the meaning of cus-
toms. Then, since customs are a
project of W. S. G. A., it is more
fitting that a larger part of the
organization should participate in
their‘ enforcement.

Likes New System »

Edith Raschen, president of W.
S. G. A., says of the new plan: “I
think this system will work out
much better. The freshman some-
times dislikes the idea of a class
just above them “lording it over"
them. With juniors on the commit-
tee, as well as sophomores, this
feeling will be done away with.”

Ruth Hamilton, Ed. '33, next
year’s vice-president of W. S- G. A.
and a forme ustoms chairman.
comments: c the’ juniors on
the committee ,will have more ex-
perience, they will be able to give
some valuable suggestions to the
sophomores. You will’ also get the
backing of both classes.”

women, will make the introductory
speech to commemorate the initial
joint installation. Edith Hirsch,
Ed. ’32, will serve as mistress of
ceremonies.

while preparing themselves for
certification to teach, will be re-
quired to apply for admission to
the School of Education on exact-
ly the same basis as will those
registered in the pre-education cur-
riculum.

According to Acting Dean L. P.
Sieg, the plan of deferred admis-
sion to the School of Education is
not aimed to decrease the number
of teachers, but to make possible
better teachers.

“It is the desire of the faculty
and administrative officers of the
School of Education of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh," said Dr. Sieg,
“to turn out as a teacher an indi-
vidual who is not only well pre-
pared, but who also has those qual-
ities of personality and character
that should go into the making or‘
a good teacher,"

“If all of the students,"_contin-
ued the Dean, “who are admitted
to the pre-education curriculum in
the College attain the standards
set up for admission to the School
of Education, they will be admit-
ted. Our goal is better preparation,
not elimination. Everystudent has
a right to a certain type of in-
struction; our desire is to try to
determine the place into which at
student will fit best.”

The present curriculum will be
revised so that the professional
education courses may be given in
the School of Education during the
last two years, In addition to~pur-
suing the necessary courses in ed-
ucation, students will continue
study in the academic subjects to
round out the requirements of a
"sound program.

Only one professional education
course will be scheduled for stu-
dents in the pre-education curricu-
lum. This will come during the
second semester of the sophomore
year and will be in the nature of
a demonstration or try-out course.
It is planned to register students
in small sections and give them an
opportunity to show before. the
group their ability in organization
and presentation of material; to
demonstrate their “teaching per-
sonality.” and to show their voice,
mannerisms, and other characteris-
tics as they address the‘ class.
With the exception of this try-out
course, the first two years of study
will be entirely of an academic
character. -

The same number of hours will
be required for graduation as un-
der the former plan.

Above is a map showing route to Taylor Alldcrdice high school,
where the Varsity Night program begins at 8 o'clock.

More than twenty “red-hot”, acts
including several of the mystery
variety, will be featured in the
Varsity Night program to be held
in the Taylor Allderdice High
school auditorium at 8 o’clock. this
evening.

The show, which is being held in
conjunction with the spring festi-
val program, is the annual Pitt
stunt night, at which the prizes
are awarded for the sweepstakes,
track meet, and floats.

As an attraction to the fraterni-
ties, a large placque will be award-
ed to the one best represented in
attendance. And strange as it may
seem, the committee has formulat-
ed a plan whereby it claims an ac-
curate count may be made.

The program, as tentatively ar-
ranged, will be opened by the Town
Tattlers orchestra playing a med-
ley of popular songs. Emeric For-
michella, Italian character come-
dian, will follow with a skit in
native dialect. Vaughan Shelton,
youthful ubiquitous artist, will ex-
hibit the intricacies of rapid-fire
cartooning.

Hog Callers Demonstrate

Those athletic Sioux City hog-
callers, Melvin Brown and Francis
Seigel, who received so much pub-
licity last fall, and even demon-
strated their ability over the radio
will give the audience an authen-
tic presentation of the lure that
makes them so successful out in
the far western barnyards.

Sumner Irey, who spends his
spare time coaxing sweet, melodies
from a musical saw, will present
his specialty and Leon and Co.,
billed as tumblers, will cavort in
a manner said to rival circus at-
tractions.

As a change from the vaudeville
variety of the program, boxing will
occupy the next spot. Joe Or-sini,
boxing coach, has arranged a little
pugilistic act, but has kept its plot
strictly to himself.

Two musicians, Myron Shuler
and Meyer Solomon will work out
on their favorite instruments, the
piano and piano-accordion, respec-
tively,-——we hope. They will be fol-
lowed by William Pillich, who
demonstrated his tap-dancing abili.
ty so ably in the recent Cap and
Gown. show.

An act which promises to be ex-
tremely humorous is the take-Off
on Romeo and Juliet to be render-

ed (and torn asunder) as long as

Work with a purpose-—and a
practical one at that—seems to
be the theory upon which
members of the junior class of

the ROTC are basing their
work.

Appearing very professional,
with surveying instruments

and paraphernalia, more than
forty men have been recently
seen pacing off distances, sur-
veying them, and recording re-
sults on large maps.

When the work is completed
a large contour map of the
entire Pitt campus will be as-
sembled. The training result-
ing from this work is of great
value in determining contours
and distance for range-finding
in artillery work.

Approximately three weeks
will be spent in completing the
map, the first detailed one of
its kind to be _,_made of the Pitt
campus.

The whirls and crashes that
often come over the loud
speaker while the favorite
crooner is before the micro-
phone are the despair of many
radio listeners, and a big prob-

lem to the radio industry.
Three seniors in the depart-
ment of electrical engineering
are investigating and using -
this problem as a basis for
their thesis required for gradu-
ation in that department.

Robert E. Kurtz, Elmer A.

’ Drabik, and Harold Evans
have been conducting tests at
the Allis-Chalmers Manufac-
turing Company for the past
three months to determine
whether or not transformer
bushings are sources of radio
interference.

By testing new bushings the
investigators hope to discover
if the fault is inherent and if
so to ﬁnd and apply corrective
measures. Results of the tests
have indicated that the bush-
ings, when new, are practical-
ly free of interference. when
used at voltages up to twice
the rated voltage, but produce
interference beyond that point.

dicted with sixty per cent accuracy,
nearly as high as the relationship
between freshman and sophomore
averages.

Thus the student who ranks
two chances out of a hundred to
attain a “B” quality point average
and twenty-three chances to make
an average of “A." A student who
ranks in the ﬁfth tenth, however,
has only twenty chances out of a
hundred for'an average of “B" and
only two chances for an “A" av-

Since it is becoming increasing-

recommended that all students

from entering college.

The Campus
Scout Says:

One of the little things which help humor collegiate sports editors
and make them realize that after all they may have been right in sub-
jugating purely academic pursuits to chiseling ones is the letter he usu-

,ally receives each week from some athlete who feels that he has been

slighted in one way or another by said journalist or by the athletic ad-
ministration. ‘ _

The good old mail man dropped a little note into the Weekly mail.
box during the past week, and the writer of the letter was plainly dis-
gusted with the order of things. Although he was not ready to commit
suicide, he probably would have knocked a coupla chips from some-
one’s shoulder if there was a chip and a shoulder around. The letter

’ ‘ follows:

. May 3, 1932.
Dear Campus Scout:

In your recent column on the sport page of the Pitt Weekly
you expressed, tactfully perhaps, the view that equal awards for
lettermen in all types of sports at the University should _be
adopted. You used too much tact in the opinion of a majority
of the members of the 1931 cross-country team.

What they wanted you to say was that the team has re-
ceived some downright, unfair treatment throughout the year.
Tlielettermen have accepted their lot of annually being award-
ed a puny four-inch felt for five or six tough grinds against the
best teams in t e country. But certainly, they are being walked
on when the hletic administration makes a change in the
"minor award ju t in time to deprive the cross-country lettermen
from gettin the improved insignia.

This form of protest may accomplish very little. Still the
sports columns of the Weekly have some weight. Athletic au-
thorities certainly read them. Our only hope is that they will
feel some pangs of conscience and if the injustice is not righted
this year, some equal treatment may be accorded to next fall's
team. _

Yours protestingly,
ANTHONY MAZZEI.

 

Nothing pleased us more this week than the receipt of the above
letter. It has been a long, long time since anyone has referred to us in
terms of affections approaching those of Mr. Mazzei; and while we
would have been more pleased if the signature at the end had been that
of a Kappa, we nevertheless pour forth mutual love and affection for
the young man. ,

We also wish to thank Mr. Mazzei for the use of the word “tact.”
In times past, we have felt that that was one requisite which we lacked,
as an angry coach poured forth words of wisdom, knowledge and advice
to a young man who was trying to get along and at the same time help
others. All this was behind closed doors with the boys down at the
Weekly office moaning at the prospect of chipping in a dime apiece for
flowers.

At these times I have felt that I was treated unfairly and that life
would be more pleasant for a sports writer if there were no coaches and
no athletic teams. And at other times, I have felt the same way with
regards to the athletic administration, but those things have passed and
the boys. usually greet me with a-hand when they see me. The hand
may be small, but alhand’s a hand.

Seriously speaking, however, we see no reason for students

- trying out for an athletic team if the reward which is theirs at
the conclusion of the season is unjust. The justification of a
major letter or a minor letter is a debatable question, and both
sides can argue fluently on the matter. o

Why have a cross-country team at the University? Fifteen
is the highest number of candidates who have ever reported for
‘the sport; and after the initial time trials and the first meet,
only the seven first-string men remain for practice. Students

‘take no interest in the sport, and no one is along the course or
at the starting point to encourage the runners.

. Other sports at the University attract at least ten interest-
ed-spectators to a duel, but not cross-country. At some schools
in the country, cross-country is a major sport, crowds attend

_ the matches and a cross-country letterman is a figure of note on
the campus.

 

We have always believed thateclross-country runners were a little
batty for devoting the time and energy necessary for the maintenance
of the physical condition required of participants considering the re-
ward’ which they have received. Most of the runners consider it their
duty to try again for the team once they have made it, and they
continue to participate in the sport although they do not enjoy it and
do not receive what they consider just laurels. .

Mr. Mazzei, however, errs when he insinuates that the athletic de-
partment made the change in the type of minor award just in time to
deprive the cross-countrymen of receiving the improved insignia. The
athletic department simply changed the type of award a short time be-
fore the Sports Dinner, and the cross-countrymen were unfortunate in
that theirs was the only minor sport which was not to receive the new
letter this year.

At present, we feel that cross-country requires more of its partici-
pants than does any other sport. Football players who dallied with
boxing this year assure me that the latter is the tougher of the two
sports, and the cross-countrymen who participated in boxing have dared
the boxers to report for cross-country. None of the other sports at the
University demand more than do these, and we are willing to accept the
word of the athletes in this matter.

If this is true, the hill-and-dalers should be more highly honored
than they are at present. Our advice to them would be to drop the
sport; and as stated in this column last week, we would suggest the
awarding of similar letters and sweaters to all eligible athletes in the
University.

[l_Faces Grove
City Today

Meets Bethany Squad
Tomorrow; Plays-
Tech Monday

 

With a season record of three
victories and no defeats the Pitt
tennis team will strive hard to
maintain this record during the

next week. Three matches are
scheduled in four days. _
Today the racqueteers from

Grove City land on the stadium

tain Ed Alcorn and his mates. The
Grovers have the reputation of
turning out better than average
teams but are not expected to be
quite strong enough to take the
Blue and Gold.
Tell Us Another

Tomorrow the team plays their
second match of the season with
the racquet wielders from Bethany
College. Pitt blanked Bethany 9 to
0 a week ago today and should re-
peat their victory with ease. We
are inviting Bob Sage, manager of
the swingers to call at the office
and explain his activities while at
Bethany. You know how stories do
float around.

Monday, the tennis team will be
at home for the Plaid of Carnegie
Tech. Tech is quite strong this
year and has won their first two
matches with ease. They took Du-
quesne over by an 8 to 0 tune.
This would indicate that Pitt and
Tech are almost evenly balanced
for the Pitt-Duke score was 9 to 0
in favor of the Blue and Gold.

Tech will be represented by
Grove, Harding, Norris, Gesling,
Jalonack, Corshenhausen and Har-
tig.
The Panther lineup ‘of Jacobs
O’Loughlin, Ganger, Cap-tain Al-
corn, Goodman and Wald remains
unchanged.

The unusual strength of the ten-,
nis team is brought out more clear-
ly by the fact that it has not lost
a. single set his season. Tweny-sev-

set is quite a record in any town.

Last week the Panthers played
only one match in which they
whitewashed Bethany by another
score of 9 to 0. The match with
Wash-Jeff was cancelled because
of the rain and will be played May
14 on the stadium courts.

Face Penn State Frosh In
Initial Meet

The Pitt freshman track team
will open its season tomorrow with
a dual meet with the Penn State
frosh at State College. The meet
will be held in conjunction with
the varsity Pitt-Penn State dual
meet.

The Panther cubs shape as an
unusually unbalanced squad. They
possess great power in the sprints,
having a.t least five men who are
above the average. The weights are
but little,'if at all, weaker. The dis-
tance runners are rather strong.
The hurdlers and the jumpers are
very weak.

'Menaker, Jacobson and ~S‘chloss-
berg will probably run the 100 and
220 yard dashes tomorrow. Menak-
er, who is being touted as a future
great among the country's sprint-
GPS. is but little speedier than the
0thef;=-CWO. Eberts and Fleming are
also qualified and are very capa-
ble.

The 440 yard dash will be han-
dled by Kiger and McDonald who
cover the distance in around fifty-
one or fifty-two seconds and are
improving continually.

Kirkpatrick is the best bet in
the half mile, while Wagenhouser
is favored to make the best show-
ing for the Panthers in the mile.
Allbright is satisfactory in the
mile.

The weights will be handled by
a group of pleasing track stars.
Gongloff is outstanding in the shot
put and the javelin. Smith, Seiffert

should take points. ,

All’s quiet on the Stadium front.
That is, all’s quiet now, but when
more than 1,500 athletes of all sizes
and shapes assemble at the Stadi-
um tomorrow for the twenty-ﬁfth
annual Pitt Interscholastic Track
a.nd Field Meet, the ground keeper’s
nightmare will have materialized.
Of course, head ground keeper
Frank Mecca, was not asked for a
statement, but his reply to one
would likely have been “I like you,
so scram now.” ‘

The ground keepers are not the
only onces who have completed
weeks of worry. Frank Carver and
Jimmy Hagan, the latter director
of the meet, have removed large
quantities of what the barber makes
a living from. (Look, a. preposi-
tion).

City Slickers Out

Out-of-town schools will, as usual,
grab off the greater portions of the
glory and the medals, as the city
schools are noted for their lack
of track talent. However, two city
schools are accorded a ﬁghting
chance, although they’1l certainly
have to ﬁght: Peabody and West-
inghouse are the city schools given
preference, but there is always the
possibility, and it helps to make a

As usua.l, the class of entrants in

that with such a ﬁeld, of runners,

Six men have been seeded for this

Several classy relay teams have

Three K. O.’s Feature

Frosh Intramural
Boxing Meet

By JOE OR»SlNl,
Pitt Boxin.Coach.

Surprises and thrills, including
three knockouts, marked the
crowning of eighft boxing cham-
pions in the Freshman Intramural
Bioxging cham-pionzshipis held at
Trees Gym, Tuesday afternoon.

The survivors of the ﬁrst round
found the going a little harder in
the semi-ﬁnals with most of the
favorites coming through in great
style. , .

The ﬁrst real surprise came in
the 125-pound class when Louis
Leon, former Y. M. ‘H. A. boxer,
gave Dick Zaiden a neat boxing
lesson. The clever Leon had things
his own way throughout the en-
tire bout. '

Little Joe ‘

In the 115-pound class it took
little Joe Pace, the North Side
pride, four rounds to beat the will-
ing and likely Fabian 'Mihelic for
the bantamweight title. These boys
stood toe to toe, arid in the end of
three rounds the officials decided on
the extra round. Pace liad a slight
shade in this round to take it and
the title.

Billy Ame-s, freshman basket-
baller from the upper Monongahela
Valley, pulled another surprise
when he gave Bernie Spiegel a
beating in three rounds. Spiegel
could no-t stop Ames’ left hand
which kept Bernie at long range
most of the time.

Lanky Vlilliam .‘v:liwim-.ner, who
really earned what he got, had to
dispose of four opponents in order
to reach the ﬁnals. In the _ﬁnal
bout of the 145-pounzl class, Bill de-
feated Mike Michaelson, a very
good prospect, to carry away the
championship.

“Whitey” Wils-3:1, basketball star
of the freshman team this year,
was not so fortunate as his pal Hil-

ly Ames. Anthony llorzifeck de-
feated “Whitey” in three good
rounds. ’

Grand Old Pete

The real thrill of the afternoon
was given by Pete Visat, who fea-
tured the festivities at the Gym by
scoring a technical K. 0. over the
hard hitting Nile Faust in the ﬁrst
round after an exchange of,blows
that looked like a windmill going
at top speed. Pete also scored an-
other K. O. victory in the semi-
ﬁnal when he dispos id of the hard

hitting Bob Dempler in the ﬁrst
round. ‘
In the ﬁnal for the 175-pound

title, Pete again proved his super-
iority when after two minutes and
ﬁfteen second of ﬁghting, the ref-
eree stopped the bout with Emile
Bonivita to -save Emile from fur-
ther punishment. Pete cut Emile's
eye in the last round, and Referee
Siege] stopped the bout.
Ed Thompson Triumphs

In the ﬁnal for the heavyweight
title, E Thompson, freshman foot-
baller, ave the highly touted Mor-
ris Louick a ne-at boxing lesson in

will also receive a cup.

Route Described

The boys will race along Bayard
street toward the Tri Dell; house,
but will kee-p on going eyen after
reaching that historic landmark.
At Belleﬁeld avenue, they will
make a left turn, racing along to

The tournament was under the

direction of Morris Cohen and Har-
old Fisher. W. D. Harrison, Pitt
Athletic Director, donated the

medals that were awarded to the

ROTC Review
Slated Soon

Army Oﬂicial At Drills
Held May 19-20

Both the Coast Artillery and
Medical units, which comprise the
Pitt ROTC, will be reviewed in the
annual inspection by a member of
the War Department, which oc-
curs this year May 19 and 20.

Major Hollis LeRoy Muller, in-
structor ot the Organized Coast
Artillery Reserves in this district
will be the official representative
of. the. War Department at the re-
view. He was one of the first
United “States aviators to see serv-
ice in the past war, and is well
qualified to judge. the efficiency of
school units.

Class room inspection has been

set tentatively for Th , while
the inspection of equip and ad-
ministration will be h Friday

morning. A review of the corps
will occur Friday afternoon in Rus-
kin field, and such drills as Major
Muller may call for will be demon-
strated.

There are nine members of last,
year's varsity squad back on the

team, and several excellent pros-ll

pects from last year's frosh squad
have come up.

The Lion sprinters will be Dale,
Van Curran and Nebel in the 100
and 220 yard dashes. and Gritsav-
age, Baird, and Rhodes in the 440.
Dale d Van Curran each ran a
220 and Gritsavage ran the $40 on
the victorious medley relay in the
Penn Relays.

The Panther sprinters will be

' Harris Milligan, and Vitulla in the

r

‘ Pittsburgh

shorter dashes, and Keller, Mon-
helm and DiMarchi in the quarter.
‘ There ‘is a plethora of half milers
on the Lion squad with Dunaway,
Rishel, Hughes, Siesky, Baird, and
Space all available. Dunaway is
ponsidered the best of these. He
ran a. beautiful half to help the
medley relay win last week at
the Penn Relays. Watkins and
Tapp will face the pick of this
group.
Glaseburn Local Boy

Glassburn, King, England, Gren-
ninger and Van Cise are looked to
as point winners for the Lions in
the mile and two mile runs. Glass-
burn is the Penn State cross-coun-
try team captain and is a former
interscholastic mile
champion, hailing from Peabody.
Roy, Clise and Thiele will pound
out the mile for Pitt and Smoyer
Mazzei and Gaines will do the two
mile.

The Penn State coach will de-,

pend on Hill, Jackson and Byers
in the high hurdles and Hill Jack-
son and Van Kuren in the lows.
Lewis, Thiessen and Simms will
hurdle for the Panthers.

Sigel and Adams will put the
shot and heave the discus for Penn
State, while Edwards will hurl the
hammer. Sigel, Snyder, and
Adams will toss the javelin. Va-
lenti, MacMurdo and Harder will
shotput for Pitt. Carver will join
Valenti and MacMurdo in the dis-
cuss event. Valenti, MacMurdo,
and Harder will heave the ham-
mer. Tormey and Craft will throw
the javelin.

Strong High Jumpers.

ﬂammond, O’Shea, and Stray-
land should form a strong Penn
State combination in high jumping
while the broad jumpers are very
weak. Greenleaf, Kershner, and
May are likely pole vaulters. 'Mc-
Connell and O’dell will pole vault,
and. Sebastian, Stirling and Kirk-

’ patrick will jump.

Six Panthers journeyed to Phila-
delphia. last Friday to participate
in the Penn -Relays, but the Pitt

,boys suffered evil luck and came

back with less than they had when
they started. “Woody” Harris,
sterling sprinter, who has been
running in great form lately, was
robbed. While out on the ﬂeld in
a track suit, his street suit of“
clothes, his watch and other valu-
ables were stolen.

The relay team itself fared bad-

. ly, taking only a fourth in the class

  

"B” mile relay event. “Valenti and
MacMurdo who were there to shot

F rash Tennis Team
Meets California Normal

With a recdrd of one vic-tory and
one tie, the Pitt freshman tennis
team seems headed for a wonder-
ful record, as the teams met to
d-ate are better than those remain-
ing on the schedule.

Last Saturday, the frosh tennis
team held the Ki-ski Prep team to
a. 3-3 tie. Kiski is rated as having
one of the strong prep tennis
teams in the East, and the Pitt
boys did well in holding, such a
team to a tie.

During the next three days, the

frosh racqueteers will have their‘

hands full with California Normal
and Carnegie Tech plebes.

California Normal will be met
tomorrow‘ afternoon, and are not
expected to funish much opposi-
tion for the frosh.

Golfers Vie
. 'With Kiski

Lions Hand Panthers!
Initial Setback

 

 

Pitt golfers face very stiff _0Dj
position when they meet Klskl
over the Highland course Monday.
Kiski has not been defeated this
year. and is rated as one of the
strongest scholastic teams in the
East.

The famous Jimmy Marks, Jr.,
will be in the lineup when the two
teams clash Monday. Marks, a real
star, won the National Interscho-
lastic crown last year. A very
bright future is in store for him
if the opinion of golf experts can
be considered authentic.

He will be supported by Captain
Mercer, George Gates and Foster
Meyer. Meyer, a Bellevue boy, is
already quite familiar with the
West View course.

Pitt will lineup with the two
Wolff brothers, Decker and either
Bernachy or Byran as its repre-
sentatives.

The golfers were handed a 6 to 0
shellacking by Freddie Brand and
his Penn State mates on the State
course last Saturday. Brand and
Regis Wolff staged a thrilling.
match with the Nittany lad win-
ning one up.

Three Stars To Receive
Diplomas In June

The prospects for next year’s
Pitt rifle team are excellent. It
would seem that a team losing
such men as Backen, Wuertenberg-
er and Wilson by graduation would
be in bad shape, Wilson was the
high scorer for the past year, Back-
en was consistent in every meet,
and Wuertenberger was the only
man on the squad to qualify in
every meet.

Yet, it seems likely that their"
places will be capably filled. Those
who are most likely to get in each
meet are Captain-elect Mair, Taus-
sig, Zoller, Franz, and Manager Car.
lin. With an array such as this it
would seem that next year's team
will be as strong as the present ag-
gregation. Besides these men, a
number of sophomores are likely to
break into the picture.

During the past year the posi-
tions and timing of the whole
squad have been considerably im-
proved, and at least six men will
enter next year's competition with
some valuable experience behind
them. Besides these men who will
make up the team‘ there will be
Lieutenant Wilson and Sergeant
Gunter, two. very capable coaches
back for another year at Pitt.

The schedulejor next year has
not yet been completed, but it will
be composed of the best teams in
the country. After the regular
schedule is completed the team
will again go to the regional cham-
pionships, and there are high hopes

of a far better showing than that
made_ this year.

Sweepstakes Fail to ,
Charm Sports Writer(?_)

 

By Special Permission of the Copy-
right Owner.)

The idea of holding an interfra-
ternity sweepstakes originated way
back in the dawn of prehistoric,
neolithic days. The idea started
from the habit of having rows and
rows of steaks lying on the pantry
shelf. As these steaks could not
well be eaten at the same time, al-
thought it was frequently tried, the
gold—brickers of the family were
set to work sweeping off the steaks
that had been lying around for a
week or two.

‘Many problems arose out of the
custom of “sweeping the steaks."
For one thing, the sweeper some-
times found himself . confronted
with chops, and the method used
for steaks could not be used. To
solve this difficulty, the copywright
owners permitted the consumers to
change the name to “Sweepstakes."
The addition of the word fraternity
came about by the regular methods
used by frats to bring their name
into everything. That is, hard and
conscientious work, with no favori-
tism allowed.

sweep sta kes

The lnterfraternity sweepstakes
that will be run off this afternoon

:is a leaf from the parent tree in

many respects. A large and gen-

erous loving cup is awarded to the.

frat ﬁnishing ahead of the ﬁeld.
However, many discrepancies have
begun to make their presence felt,
and when the starter stutters “GO”
this afternoon, the contestants and
their vehicular contrivancs will not
be anything like those that primi-
tive man used. The only thing re-
maining, in fact, are the primitive
men.

The entrants in the race will
seem queer to the average, that is,
unenlightened, student. Each fra-
ternity enters one driver and four
pushers, in addition to the mechan-
ical device that moves whenever
sufficient pressure is applied. The
difference in the intelligence of the

Out in the Open

C -HEN THE ADMINISTRATION has to step in and po-
;~ lice polling‘ places in Student Council elections, it is a
situation that should shame every fair-minded student in the
 e-University. Such a necessary course of action is a reﬂection
i ,. upon even the adequateness of the education system under
 -which we labor. ‘
i There is something gloriously inconsistent, for instance,
,in the spectacle of political science students professing dis-
?‘may. at the tactics of a professional political ring, and then,
, themselves, walking out of the classroom to deposit hand-
ffuls of illegally marked votes in campus ballot boxes.
The action of the University administration in ordering
a revote on Student Council candidates is proof that poli-
‘tics,‘which center around the councilmanic political plum,
have reached a new height. Horseplay and petty fraternity
iactionism on the Pitt campus have run rampant this year.
 Perhaps, however, we have been at fault in even sup-
posing that fair college elections are possible. We have
A, ‘ held faith in the integrity of campus organizations too long.
,. e must now admit that there will always be factions and
so long as there are factions, unfair elections may be ex-
 pected. « , l
K _ We suggest an open and above-board campaign. Let
 there be two or more recognized. political parties among the
 undergraduates. Let there be political mass meetings at a
’*Iwhich the candidates shall state their views on campus af-
fairs. Let there be political posters placed on University
fbulletin boards. Student campaigning needs to be brought
“out into the light. Then, perhaps, from all the lusty elec-
tioneering that would result, we might obtain, at least, a
 minimum amount of constructive suggestions. And certain-
'3 , ly all the slippery, underhand tactics of the present “whis-
poring campaigns” would be exposed.

 A Personal Appearance

A I , ROBERT L. RIPLEY, who has won something more than
 ‘ a little fame as a newspaper cartoonist, made a “per-
sonal appearance” at Memorial Hall this week, and “Be-
lieve-It-or-Not,” delivered himself of one of the shortest as-
-sembly speeches on record.
,  In accomplishing that unusual feat, Mr. Ripley nobly
‘ succeeded in disappointing one of the largest audiences ever
to attend a University assembly. '
-' Celebrities, as one assumes Mr. Ripley to be, are natur-
ally granted certain privileges that are denied the average
individual. But among those privileges, there is to be found
no right for the famous one to impose on the good nature of
a public that has helped him to success. Mr. Ripley ’s “per-
sonal appearance” was all too much like the movie siren
who coirdescends to honor her audience by slithering
across the stage attired in a satin gown.
Certainly, Sigma Delta Chi, the organization that ar-
r ranged the assembly, had been given to understand that Mr.
P; A Ripley would present a program of adequate length.
A  Mr. Ripley has been made to assume the brunt of the
criticism. Perhaps, he was helpless about the matter, since
his newspaper sponsor seemed intent in displaying him in
as many parts of the city as a half day ’s time would permit.

Addresses Hungry Club

Dr. David A. Robertson, presi-

the Hungry Club last Monday in
the English room of the Fort Pitt
Hotel on the subject of “Personnel
Methods and the Presidency.” Dr.
David R. Craig, director of the Re-

presided at the meeting.

_Dr. Robertson spoke on the pos-
sibility of applying modern person-
nel methods to the evaluation of
candidates for any given. public of-
ﬁce.

Dr. Robertson listed duties re-
quired of the president, asserting
that if we are to have good pregi.

who has the qualities and the abil-
ﬂies for carrying out executive du-

es.

students enrolled in the courge will
be allowed to select the problems
to be discussed at the forum. Each
week a different professor will
lead the class in its studies, with
two of the classes to be bf the lee-
ture type, and the other to be dis-
cussion.

The professors who lecture will
be selected from the various facul-
ties of the social science depart-
ments. The class will meet Mon-
days, Wednesdays and Fridays at
the seventh hour. Three credits
which may be used to fill any field
requirement in the social sciences
will be given for the work.

Last Sunday was a beautiful day. Bird songs, sun-
shine, buzzing flies, and all that sort of thing. The
first day of summer, glorious and jocund.

“Let’s have a picnic,” coaxed my hoiden, “just you

and me.” No sooner said than done. Humming love
songs and clapping several odd “Peace porridge hot;
pease porridge cold,” I was ready in a. jiffy.

Out of the clothes press came the summer ﬂannels
and into the picnic basket went the olives, potato
salad and minced ham sandwiches. With a nickel
bottle of ginger beer. "How lovely," cooed my love-
bird, ‘‘we’ll find a male bittsle grove, just you and
me, and we'll have a. ittie bittsie picnic."

I'm not much for picnics,-ever since the time I lost
the three-legged race at the Baptist Sunday School
outing. But this was different. The wind tousled
my curly locks as we whizzed along the highway in
my speedster. I was thrilled! So thrilled, in fact,
that speed meant nothing to me. I tramped the
accelerator to the floor. We were hitting a fair 22
miles per hour, and I took it as calmly as if it were
nothing. “’Whoopee," I screamed. My girl cautioned
me with a wave of her little finger. _ She knows. my
enthusiasm has no bounds. Once, it was she who
saved me from ruin when she stopped my dissipa-
tion. There I was stomping through the May Drug
Company, my mind blurred with the effects of six
lemon phosphates, recklessly throwing away my
money in the penny weighing machine. She it was
who rescued me from disgrace.

I curtsied modestly.

The white cloth spread over the grass, fastened at
the corners with bottles of mustard and salt shakers,
and my little dove laid out the picnic delicacies. In
the bottom of the basket I found a pink paper hat.
The old life of the party instinct, and in a swish I
had it on my head and prettied about the grass,
skipping, kicking my heels, and singing “Hail To
Pitt.” Then Iedid my-thimble trick. How--my dar-
ling laughed! Good old Weslager, ever spreading
sunshine. Suddenly a weirdnoise rumbled from be-

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a tornado of
paper plates, torn linen, and cardboard spoons. Po-
tato salad fell on my shoulders like hall. The dam
bull had wrecked our dinner. I stopped at last,
breathing heavily. Suddenly I remembered my lady
love. I had left her to the mercy of that mad bull.

lager; 1, whose grandfather was the Gallant Gus of
Mciiees Rocks. Here stood one whose veins surged
with Weslager blood refusing to assist a lady. Fie!

Determined on rescue wha,tever.my ownpeualty,
I wheeled about. Over the gross I ran. Throughthe
bushes. My face bled against the burred twigs.

In the clearing I saw my lady love. What was she
doing beside that wild animal? Why it seemed
tame! It was standing still! She had her hands on
the animal! Suddenly she turned. “Look,” she
said, “I have something ittle bittsie for you to drin "
It wasa bucket of milk! “Ha, ha,” I said, "I foo
