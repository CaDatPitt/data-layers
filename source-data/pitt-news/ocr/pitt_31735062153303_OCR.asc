ANT] INTERSIIHTTLASTIII
  MEETTHIS SATURDAY

The annual intercollegiate and in-
terscholastic track meet under the
auspices of the University is schedul-
ed for this Saturday at Schenley
Oval and should far surpass all form-
er meets. This will be the ﬁrst inter-
collegiate meet in several years, but
it promises some mighty interesting
competition with Penn State entering
a full team, in addition to W. & J..
Allegheny, Geneva, West Virginia,
Bethany, Marietta, Westminster,
Grove City and Thiel,

Invitations were sent to over one
hundred high and prep schools in

 

and eastern Ohio and the big major-
ity of ‘them have entered full teams.

It is probable that a large crowd
will see the meet on Saturday, as it
will be the best opportunity to see
Captain Thornton's men in action this
year, the only other home meet being
that with West Virginia on the Oval
June 4. All eyes will be on Esler.
Hays, who has been creating quite a
sensation in the east by his recent
victories over Johnny Simmons of Sy-
racuse, former intercollegiate cross-
country champion, and Curtis,‘ of the
Navy, -one of the greatest milers of
the country and Olympic competitor.
Hays «broke the University one-mzile
record last Saturday in the ﬁne time
of‘, 4:25. In the intercollegiates on
Saturday Hays will be matched
against “Blondy” Romig, State’s great
two-miler and present intercollegiate
cross-country champion. .

The meet on Saturday will be the
last good chance to see Frank Shea
in action, as there is ‘no doubt but
what he will be forced to extend him-
self in the 220 and 440. .

The events will be started at 12:30.
the collegiate quarter-mile being set
for 1:30 and the two-mile for 2:15.
The meet will be over‘by 4:30.

Jas. C. Mace: spoke at the closing
meeting of the Uni-Y--Club discussion
group Tuesday evening. Oﬂicers for
the ensuing year were chosen and will
be published in next week's Weekly.
The club feels that it has been an un-
qualiﬁed success despite the fact that
the year -was almost gone before or-

 

work started. The speakers have
been men‘ who know students and the
problems they face. The practical
test however came immediately after
the talks when the -cluib in open forum
made practical application of the ma-
terial presented to the present condi-
tions at Pitt.

The ﬂnali meeting of the club for
this year will be held in the East Lib-
erty Y. M. ‘C. A. May 25, when they
will banquet the baseball squad.

“Baseball Reunion Day” last Satur-
day at Forbes Field was a howling
success. A large crowd of old time

‘baseball stars were out and, incident-

ally, saw-W‘; & J. stack up 10 errors
and lose for the second time this year.
The score was 8 to 1 for Pitt. It
looked like a reunion of the great
football teams of» recent years when
one spied “Pud" Seidel, “Jock” -Suth-
erland, “Jimmy” Dehart. “Andy” Hast-
ings, “Skip” Gougler, “Jake” Stahl,
“Red” ‘Ca.-rlson and
other old stars on deck.

“Chalky" Williamson and “Bob”
Peck staged a little reunion of their
own when Culver Military Academy
and the Pitt Freshmen clashed Friday
at Forbes Field. “Bob” coaches Cul-
ver and “Cha1ky” the Freshmen.
“Chalky” got the decision in a. good
game, although “Bob” could hardly
boast of the classy material which the
Fresh offer.

IT SPEAKS WELL FOR PITT

If interest in a student government election may be taken as a
criterion of conditions in an institution, then Pitt is in a healthy
state. Last”week’s elections speak volumes for school spirit here.
Never was such interest evidenced in an election and never was
there su_' .  turnout of voters. Withi more than ninety per ‘cent
of the ,St”I; .-nts on the campus voting, a record ballot was cast. _

I , Faced by such spirit, the newly-elected class officers and sena-
tors can begin their work with conﬁdence. Such a great percentage
of, the students having participated in their selection, the work of
class officers and theStudent Senate is certain to be closely scrutin-
ized. An opportunity is in the grasp of the class heads and the Sen-
ate‘ when they can prove to the student body that they are true rep-
resentatives and that they have the welfare of the school at heart.

, Complaint has often been lodged against senators that they have de-
voted more time to their election than to the pursuance,of~ their
duties. See if the new Senate cannot remove this stigma.

- I Next year’s three upper’classes,have decided that Harvey J.‘
Harmon, H. Russell Stahlman and Lewis E. Abeles will be their heads.
Let these three start a friendly rivalry between the classes in plan-
ning events so that the school year of 1921-1922 will be the most
memorable up to that time.

Last week  ‘the ~a_ddition or
three‘ morelvictoriels -to Pitt’s string

of consecutive wins._ The total is:
seven ‘straight.  Grove City,
’Bucknell and.W. & J.‘ bit the dust

DOW

before the rush of Coach Hal-ley’s
tessers. The play had a -“big
league” aspect; all the ‘games were
played at Forbes Field. To continue
the lim-pression, the. Panthers per-
formed in “ﬁtting style: '
The defeat of Grove City" by the
score "of 3 to 2', was witnessed Wed-
nesday._ = By takingﬁdvantage of the

visitors’ misplays the Panthers were.

enabled to push across‘ four count-
ers. The game was a pitaching duel
between Barrett and. smith,"’i:vith the
Pitt star. ha-vi‘ng‘a‘decided advantage.
The work of the whole, team ‘ was
striking. ’ The team Qd.is‘p1ay‘ed a
and a resource-
ful attack. A _ " ,

The contest with Bucknell’ marked
the second-victory of the week when
-the Panthers "humbled the visitors,
3. to 1. The -Pitt team had ‘one big

inning, ‘the seventh, when they scored,
Townsend pitched air- .

three times.
tight ball, mastering all tight places
‘and causing, nine men to‘-..fan_ the
'ozone.- ‘V  .
For the second time this season,
W. & J. went «down before the
Panther onslaught However they
presented abetter‘ team than they
did at the last start. This time they
escaped with an“ 8 to 1 drubbing.
The only bright spot in the visitors
-play was the work of Irwin and
Craft. W. &. ..J'.’s play was ‘marred

by continuous errors, ‘contributing

largely to -the., Panthers run column;
Noble made his initial‘ appearance .on

-‘the Varsity, .His work on the hill

was pleasing  all respects.

The .-play inall three contests was
marked -by good ﬁelding and timely
"hitting. I f-T‘he_,, spirit and team: work
