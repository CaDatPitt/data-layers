Local activists protest

Protesting society’s tolerance, Of
sexual violence, an estimated 1,000
women and men gathered in front
of the downtown Federal Building
Friday night for the Take Back the
Night March.

*4’ The purpose of the march was to
“defy the unspoken curfew that
has been placed on women
because of the threat of sexual
violence," according to officials of
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.

According to Carol Mullen of
PAAR and coordinator of the march,
“this is an opportunity for the
community to gather together and
be safe after dark.”

Q The march originated about 20
years ago and has been a standard
event in most big cities. There
were 38 community endorsers for
the march, including the University
of Pittsburgh Women's Studies
Department.

Following the march, there was

04 survivor speak—out, in which

both women and men talked
about the violence they had
personally experienced. After
the speeches, an all- woman
group, Cross Currents, gave a
musical performance.

Mullen said that thelreason
this kind of march is necessary
is that “women are very restricted
on what they do and when they
can do it. They have to plan
their schedules so that they are
not out at night.”

Deborah Gould, president of
the Campus Women’s
Organization, was very
impressed with the event.

“The feeling was great;
everyone was glad that they
had come. It was very powerful
and moving. The way it was put
together was really good.
Everyone I talked to said it was
the best event of this kind they
had ever attended."

‘The speakers were terrific,”
Gould added. One woman who
spoke had been raped on the

Kimbo remembered with
‘Images of Black Artists’

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Forty-five never before
exhibited works of art will be
on display until Nov. 4 as part
of Pitt’s “Images of Black Artists,
a Celebration of Heritage”
exhibit.

“This is an opportunity to
provide access to public exhibit
to artists who may not have
had the chance to showcase
their work in private galleries,”
said Dennis Donham, interim
vice president for student
affairs.

The exhibit this year is
dedicated to the late Dr.
Conney Matthew Kimbo, who
last year, in his position as vice
president of student affairs,
organized the first three
showcases, all of which
featured black artists. Each of
those exhibits was dedicated
to individual artists.

“There was never really any

question that this one would
be dedicated to him. Our only
question was whether or not
we could pull it off without

him, and we did. It was a“

whole office effort,” Donham
said.

Twenty—four artists’ work are
part of the exhibit, which has
given some of them a chance
to express their feelings about
blacks in today’s society.

“As an artist, a woman and a
black, I must interpret and
document not only the external
struggle of my times but the
emotional results of living in a
society that is bound and
determined to deny my
existence. I will not remain
invisible,” artist Jaqueline
Jordan said.

Both sculpture and ﬂat media
are part of Images. There
were three main requirements
for a work to be considered
for the exhibit.

Homecoming ’89 was “a huge
success” both on the field and
off, thanks to a Pitt football win
and a new format of activities
from the Pitt Program Council,
according to a PPC official.

Following tradition, Chappale
Burton and Vicki Trout were
crowned Homecoming King and
Queen during a halftime
ceremony at the Pitt—Navy game.

However, the traditional
homecoming formal dance was
replaced this year by a Monte
Carlo night, sponsored by the
PPC.

According to Erin Carney, PPC
homecoming chairwoman, those
who attended the Monte Carlo
Night activities in the William Pitt
Union “had the greatest time.
People loved playing the games.”

Students could gamble at
blackjack and roulette tables using
chips. The chips were used at the
end of the evening to bid on
prizes in an auction. ‘

The auction prizes included
gift certificates and Pitt clothing,

but the grand prize was two‘

USAir tickets to fly anywhere in
the continental United States.

“The winners [Of the plane
tickets] were thrilled,” said Carney.
“They said this was the best idea
the Pitt Program Council has come
up with since they’ve been in
school.” '

In addition to gambling, food
was served and a band played for
those who wanted to dance.
Carney said she received
favorable comments on the band,
“but most of the people wanted
to play the games.”

Carney said that though “there
was not as many people as I
would have liked to see, I think
it went well,” since it was the first
time an activity like this had been
planned for homecoming.

Peter Ricks from Food Services,
who catered the event, said, “This
is a great idea to build on.”

Attendance at other
homecoming activities was up
this year, said Carney.
Homecoming week events
included Remote Control,
Comedy Night with Jimmy Krenn
and Pitt Night Out, in which
Oakland businesses gave student
discounts. “It’s nice to have that
there for students,” said Carney.

Homecoming voting also
increased. “There were more
votes this year than I've ever
seen,” said Carney. e

Another popular attraction was
the keg roll on Friday. A mixed
team of three men and one
woman won the obstacle course
on the Cathedral of Learning lawn.

’Pz'tt Nite Out’ gives many local businesses at boom

By Kathie Roth
Staff Writer

Many area merchants who
participated in Thursday’s Pitt Nite
Out sale sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council reported
increases in student business
during the sale.

The one-day event offered a
special discount for students

" wearing their Pitt clothing. In

past years, the sale was known as
Bar Nite and involved mostly
bars and pizza parlors. This year,
however, the annual pre-
homecoming sale was expanded
to include many types of
businesses, according to Erin

   
 

Carney, homecoming
chairwoman.
“We [got an enthusiastic

response from businessesl, but a
lot more people wanted to get
involved than did,” Carney said.
“We could only include those
who could give an immediate
answer.”

The businessesthat were able
to participate in the sale were
offered advertising incentives,
Carney said. “We [the PPCI offered
to print up a ﬂyer.”

The advertising was successful
formany of the businesses who
took part in the sale. Jim Earley,
manager of Goodies Inc., said,
“We got a lot of people who

Have a great picture
or an interesting story?
Use your creativity to...

didn’t even know we were here.”

Barb Warner, proprietor of‘

Perspectives hair salon, was also
very pleased with the success,
“We did really well. I’d like to do
it again.”

Jay Pantry, the owner of Jay’s
Bookstall, was surprised with the
response his store got. “It attracted
many theater students. But the
name caused some confusion.”
According to Pantry, the students
were under the impression that
the stores would remain open
throughout the evening.

Avalon Vintage Clothing Store
also had a successful
Bridgette Burner, a representative
of the store, said, “I think it was

  
 
   

day. a

$400 [in sales] just from that.”

However, there were a few
store representatives who felt that
the sale did not draw any unusual
student business to their shops.‘

Tracey Mclntosh, assistant
manager of Pizza Hut, felt that
this was because the Pitt students
are what largely makes up their
clientele usually. “We always offer
a student discount.”

Representatives of Leonard’s
Men’s Shop, Rax Restaurant,
Uncle Sam’s Subs and Greek Street
felt that though the sale did not

draw any extraordinary sales, Pitt
Nite Out was still a good idea.

Dina Lapiska, the unit manager
of Rax Restaurant, said, “It wasn’t
overwhelming, just a neat idea to
do.”

Carney expressed a desire to
expand the idea still further in
years to come. According to her,
many students were unaware of
the sale though “it was advertised
a couple of times in T/9ePz‘tt/Vews
during the week. It needs tobe
emphasized a little more.”

week plan.

The true history of America is not in the historical books

“Don't believe tbeHype. ” What
follows is an attempt to set the
record straight on a few myths
that I’ve found to be widespread.

Those gentle and benevolent
Europeans did not civilize Afrika.
It happened the other way
around. Civilization began in
Afrika, and one of the most
amazing civilizations that ever
existed was in Egypt, created
and run by black people. An
example of this civilization is the
Pyramids which still stand mil-

lions of years later  They
contain the exact value of pi,
the distance between sun and
earth and are still not under-

stood. It was from these Egyp-
tians, these black people, that
the Greeks and Europeans
learned much of their mathe-
matics, science, culture, and
architecture. For example,
Pythagorus of the Pythago-

 

rean theorem was trained in Egypt
and so was Plato.

Although many people have tried
to hide these facts for some time, it
is now known that the a original
inhabitants of this earth were black
people. (The oldest human skele-
tons found have been in Afrika.)[...l
These are the facts, read about them.

The first President of this country,
George Washington, was not every-
one’s founding father. Washington
once traded a black man for a keg of
molasses. (Oh AmeriKKKa the

beautiful.) Although he may not
have told a lie, do you smell
something a little morally devoid
here?

President Abraham Lincoln was
not the “Great Emancipator”, he
was a racist and a redneck. He
did not free the enslaved African-
Americans because of his love
and appreciation for “Freedom,
Justice, and the American Way”.
It was an economic thing, but
now you misunderstand. Lincoln
freed the slaves in order to take

away the free labor base of the ,

South and, in doing so, wreck
havoc on their economy. Notice
that he didn't free the slaves in
the Northern states. If George
Washington and Abraham Lin-
coln are the epitome of the
American Way, what are we
saying about the American way.

Remember ya’ll, don't believe

the hype.

Pitt overcomes mental errors to topple Navy 31-14

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Despite playing a poor first half, marred
by nine penalties and two lost fumbles,
the Pitt football team beat Navy 31-14 on
Saturday in front of a homecoming crowd
of over 50,000.

The records show that the nine penalties
cost the Panthers just 65 yards, but they
wiped out several big plays, including a
long pass from Alex Van Pelt to Reggie
Williams late in the first quarter. At one
point in Pitt’s opening drive, three of four
plays were negated by the seemingly
omnipresent yellow flag. Overall Pitt had
13 penalties for 90 yards.

“The penalties just took us completely
out of the first half,” said Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried. “The first six or seven
penalties took us from down to the 10- or

Pant/oers  

“I’m just happy to get out of ’
here with a win I’m not
concerned where we’re ranked;
I’m just glad we won  We made
a lot of mistakes, but I’m pretty
satisfied with our play  Rankings
don’t matter until you’re way up
there  Hey, a win is a win.”

Wrong. In the business of big-
time college football, a win is not

 

just a win. Winning is a relative
term. A team’s play is evaluated
by how well they successfully
execute their game plan and
especially by how decisively they
beat their opponents.

Many teams adopt the attitude
that they do not care about where
they are ranked, and Pitt is
certainly one of those teams.
However, if a college football
team is in the top 10, then they
are considered to be one of the
best in the nation, no matter how
one looks at it, numbers or no

honor comes a responsibility. A
responsibility which Pitt has been
questionable in living up to.

quarterback Alex Van Pelt each

20-yard line back to the 50. You have to be
able to overcome that, because you can’t
have that many and expect to put points
on the board early."

Van Pelt added,”I think we played well,
but the penalties killed us. It seemed like
we would get six to eight yards a play but
the penalties killed them. The referees
called a very tight game.”

A Van Pelt fumble in the first quarter set
up the first score of the game. Van Pelt
dropped back to pass from Pitt’s 15-yard
line, Navy’s strong safety Chris Cordero
blitzed from the blind side and forced the
Van Pelt fumble. Two plays later, Navy
quarterback Alton Grizzard hit Jerry
Dawson for a 12-yard touchdown pass
putting the Midshipmen up 7-0. It was the
first touchdown pass of the year for Navy.

At the 10:01 mark in the second quarter,
Van Pelt evened the match. His 19-yard

 
  

scoring toss to Ricky Turner capped off a
68-yard scoring drive.

Pitt moved ahead of the Mids on their
next drive. Split end Henry Tuten and
fullback Ronald Redmon combined for 35
yards to move the Panthers to the 26-yard
line. Ed Frazier’s 43-yard field goal attempt
had plenty of distance, and the score was
10-7.

With less than two minutes to go in the
first half, two long passes by -Van Pelt
brought Pitt to the Navy 21-yard line. Van
Pelt was looking to get closer when another
blind side blitz, this time by Rodney Brown,
caused a second Van Pelt fumble. The
score stood at 10-7 at halftime.

“He’s got to see it and be able to dump
the ball. He didn’t see it today. They did it
out of something. they hadn't shown
before,” said Gottfried of the two fumbles

‘forced by Navy blitzes. “But he picked up

   

two for touchdowns. That’s the education
of a quarterback.”

Pitt looked like a new team in the third
quarter, a team deserving of their No. 9
national ranking. On Navy’s second play
of the half, Pitt freshman defensive lineman
Keith Hamilton forced a Grizzard fumble.
Navy recovered but lost 18 yards on the
play. Navy’s play calling ineptness and
dependency on the wishbone offense was
never more apparent than on their next
play. On third down and 29 from the 4-
yard line Navy ran another option play,
where they failed to gain a yard.

Navy ran the ball 48 times and gained
just 95 yards. On their 19 passing attempts
Navy netted 152 yards.

“We had practiced for the option play all
week long. They run it very well, ” said Pitt
defensive end Carnel Smith. “We made a

Steelers‘ 17-7 Victory over Browns avenges 51-point drubbing

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer
#3

It wasn’t particularly beautiful,
but neither was the Mona Lisa.

Yesterday the Steelers avenged
their humiliating 51-0 opening

day defeat, by beating the
Cleveland Browns 17-7 in
Cleveland.

“I was very satisﬁed with the
win. A lot had to do with what
happened the first time we

it played” said Steeler head coach
Q

Chuck Noll. “Our defense played
well and their defense didn’t score

against us.”
On opening day, the Browns
scored three defensive

touchdowns against Pittsburgh.
This time the Steeler’s defense set
up the first points of the game. A
Dwayne Woodruff interception
led to a 49-yard ﬁeld goal by Gary
Anderson. The score remained 3-
0 until the second half.

In the third quarter, Todd
Blackledge threw a 14-yard

touchdown pass to Rodney Carter
and the Steelers went up 10-0.
Blackledge, who replaced the
injured Bubby Brister, was 9-28
passing for 143 yards with one
interception and one touchdown.
But more importantly, he played
steady and didn’t make any big
mistakes.

Blackledge’s quarterback
opposition, Bernie Kosar, had a
rough day with the Steeler
defense. Kosar was just 15-41 for
162 yards. The big stats on Kosar

were his four interception and no
touchdowns.

“I’m very disappointed with
my performance. I feel I let the
team and the fans down. I feel I
let myself down,” said Kosar.

Cleveland closed the gap to 10-
7 in the fourth quarter when
rookie Eric Metcalf ran in from 2
yards out.

Dwight Stone returned the
ensuing kick off 73 yards to the
Cleveland 25 yard line. The
Steelers drove to the two yard

line and were faced a fourth and
one situation. Noll decided to go
for the first down, rather than
kick a field goal which would
have put the Steelers up by six.
Blackledge kept the ball and
jumped over his offensive line
for the first down.

Three plays later Warren
Williams ran into the endzone
from one yard out to seal the
Pittsburgh victory. Williams led
the Steelers in rushing with 47
yards on 15 Carries.

few mistakes during the first half,
but I made some adjustments in

the second half and started
playing him a little closer,”

“They did a lot better with the
wishbone than I thought [they
would],” said Grizzard. “They

gave me a lot of reads that allowed ,

me to run, but I was unable to
toss the ball outside.”

Navy’s other touchdown, which
came early in the fourth quarter,
was a near photocopy of their
first. Grizzard hit Dawson again,
this time for 20 yards, making the

score 24-14. “Their secondary
played well, and we tried to take
advantage of what they would
give us. I was pleased to get two
touchdown passes. I took what
they gave me,” said Dawson.

Pitt’s leading rusher this season,
Curvin Richards sat out the first
half because he was late for some
meeting, and he is also nursing a
nagging groin injury.

One would never be able to
tell there was anything wrong
with him from his performance
on Saturday. On his first run, with
less than two minutes remaining

in the third quarter, Richards

dashed 52 yards for his fifth ‘

touchdown of the year. Richards
ended with 66 yards on four
carries.

But for the second consecutive
week, Adam Walker led the
Panthers in rushing yardage. His
105—yard performance was the
first time Walker went over the
century mark since the Ohio State
game last year. 1

Walker also had two
touchdowns Saturday, a 10-yard
run on Pitt’s first drive of the
second halfand a 4—yard reception
with less than a minute remaining

Pitt center Dean Caliguire said
his job is made easier knowing
he has two dangerous tailbacks
running behind him. “I didn’t

played flattly, was not mentally
prepared and furthermore, made
all sorts of mistakes against a
notoriously terrible Temple squad
last week, a team which the
Houston Cougars walloped 65-7.
After Navy, Gottfried said, “the
offense [Pitt’sl was sluggish; I
didn’t feel comfortable about this
game the whole time. Both
Temple and Navy played very

hard against us.”

Well, most teams play hard
against their opponents, or at
least they try to. And Temple and
Navy are two teams which
Gottfried should ‘feel at least
comfortable about. The Pitt
football team seems to be falling
into the same predicament that
the basketball team usually finds
itself in; that is lowering their
level of play to the wrong
opponents and bringing it up a
notch against the right ones. Pitt
basketball beat Oklahoma, Seton
Hall, Georgetown, Syracuse,
Villanova and St. Johns They
lost to Duquesne, Siena and Ball
State, games which should have
been easy victories.

Pitt football has beaten
Syracuse, Boston College and
earned itself a moral victory by
tying West Virginia in
Morgantown. Conversely, they
have literally struggled with
themselves and Temple and Navy
by fumbling and killing
themselves with penalties.
Perhaps it is a good sign thatthe
Panthers cannot play well and
still beat these teams. However, a
team which plays as well as Pitt
should be crushing teams like
Temple and Navy, no excuses.

Again, being one of the top
teams in the nation, the creme de
la creme, brings unto itself a
certain responsibility of earning
such. praise. A team cannot afford

i')'[O feel “lucky,” a word many Pitt

players and coaches use, by
beating these unranked
opponents. Some Pitt players
often talk about being in line for
a national championship and that

possibility is still very much alive.
This kind of talk usually takes
place after games like West
Virginia. However,_ the

to contend for the national
championship, then consistency
in playing like the No. 9 team in
the nation should be their ultimate

championship talk sidelines itself goal,

after games which Pitt knows in
its heart ‘it should have won
decisively, to saylthe least.

As linebacker Curtis Bray put it
in the Navy post—game
conference, “We definitely did
not play like the No. 9 team in the
country. As a whole, we're not
consistent enough. And our
ranking-- it's good to have, and
it probably won’t change, but it
doesn't matter until you get way
up there,” Bray said.

Well, the Panthers are way up
there, No. 9 to be exact (before
today’s new AP poll is released).
And ‘Pitt’s play does matter in
every game. Ifthe team is planning

Navy coach Eliot Uzelac
accused Gottfried of running up
the score when Van Pelt hit Adam
Walker for a late fourth quarter
score. I certainly ‘did not see
anyone on the Navy sidelines
waving a white ﬂag. If Pitt did not
score, they would have won by
only ten points; a margin which
would really have raised some

serious question as to the real,

ability of this team.

To score and to score often is
the ultimate goal of excellent
teams. Notre Dame just recently
beat an .excellentAir Force squad
on away turf by a 41-27 tally. No;
3 Colorado pounded Iowa State

52-17. Miami demolished Sanjose
State 48-16.

To illustrate with a far- fetched
example, if Ivan Lendl beat an
unranked amateur in a tennis
match by a score of 7-5, 2-6, 6-4,
3-6, 7-5, I’m sure he wouldn’t feel
too lucky. He probably would
just think about how badly he
played. On the same note, Pitt
should start thinking about how
badly they played instead of

dishing out credit to all these ,

unranked teams with horrendous
records. We’re talking about the
No. 9 team in the country feeling
lucky that they beat Temple and
Navy. There is something
intrinsically wrong with that way
of thinking.

' The Panthers are an excellent

team at times. They are far from
excellent on many other
occasions where they should ﬁnd
it easy to be excellent. The mark
of a championship team, or even
a great team, is to be as successful
as possible against any type of

opponent. And even though Pitt -

has won their last two games, it
may be a little difficult to label
them as successful outings.

Now if the Panthers wind up
beating Notre Dame in South
Bend on Oct. 28, then they will
be lucky and happy to leave with
a win. But there is still Miami,
East Carolina, Penn State and
Rutgers to contend with. And

one of these days, ‘against an .

unsuspecting team which should
by all rights pose no threat to the
Panthers, their luck may run out.

Alexander and Perdue

learning college ropes.»

By Kent Hulnicl:
Staff Writer

The transition from high school
to college is often difficult for
many people. For an athlete this
can be even more difficult. But
Scott Alexander and ].R. Perdue
have made the transition well,_
according to Panther head soccer
coach Joe Luxbacher.

“They have shown ﬂashes of
good play and flashes of
inconsistency, but both have
played well and will get better as
they get older. They make things
happen,” said Luxbacher.

One might think that they
would be at a disadvantage in
terms of experience when playing
against older opponents. But in
this case, this proves not to be
true.

“The older players help us out
a lot in practice and games.
Sometimes Marc [Mostinckx], or

Mike [Blatzl, or Heinz lPak] will
pull us aside during a game and
make a suggestion or comment
on the play we just made, or give

us some advice, which helps a .

lot, ” said Alexander.

Perdue added, “We’re learning
everyday, and we just want to,‘
keep learning and grow with the‘ ‘
program. All the playing time we
get helps a lot.” i

According to Luxbacher,
Alexander’s strength is his ability
to hold the ball.

“In practice, Joe has me work a
little extra on holding the ball,”
Alexander said. A

As for Perdue, Luxbacher noted

his ability as a ‘dangerous shooterﬁ

“I like to shoot if I get the chance,
I just want to add whatever I
can,” said Perdue.

Alexander said, “We just have
to adapt to this physical style of
play and learn where to play the
ball.’’
