UPMC Willtest experimental AIDS drug on patients

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

An experimental drug will be tested on A

20 AIDS patients at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

The drug called L—735,524 was devel-
oped by Merck Research Laboratories.

Dr. john Mellors, who is the head of
the project, said, “It is quite different
[from AZT]. It blocks a different mole-

System upgrade  
aids in students’
search for classes

By Steve Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

After spending hours finding the best classes
and the perfect schedule for the next semester,
finding out that one of the classes is closed can be

both frustrating and discouraging.

Students’ can now avoid these problems thanks
to a major enhancement inthe ISISINFO comput-
er service. The upgraded system now makes
it possible for. students, faculty and staff with
Pitt computer access accounts to .use keyword
searches to ﬁnd extensive information about class-

CS.

“The keyword searching capabilities now make
this system an extremely powerful tool for advi-
sors and students alike,” Carl Ventresca, a
Computing and Information Services (CIS) analyst,

who made the changes to ISISINFO, said.

“Before, you had: to use the Course Registration
Number. That could only look at one class,” CIS
spokesperson Colleen Carr said. “Now you can
use the keyword search and choose from a list of
classes.  is a great help to students and advi-

sors.”

A description of over 20,000 course sections
from the university’s five campuses can be
accessed by ISISINFO. Course description, the
number of open seats ‘currently available, prereq-
uisites, the academic requirements the course ful-
fillments and information about other sections can

be viewed by users in seconds. .

“Although the data base is very large, users
. . a fraction
of the time it would take to manually search
the course catalog for that data,” Ventresca

“Protease is essential for the virus to

UPMC will join New York Medical
Center Bellevue Hospital in New York
City and North Shore Medical Center in
Stonybrook, Long Island, as the initial
test locations for the experimental drug.

Mellors said, “We are looking for 20 to

» 25 patients who are infected and have

high levels of the virus in the blood-
stream. Their T—Cell [CD4] count should
be less than 500.” According to Mellors,
patients will receive either AZT or one of

two doses of the experimental drug.

Mellors said it will.probably take a
month to enroll the patients for the
study, and then the test will last six
weeks. “If the drug is safe and works
against the virus, it will be extended
another six weeks.” Mellors said.

“I’m somewhat optimistic because the
drug has been developed specifically to
inhibit the HIV protease. I think attack-
ing the protease molecule will work,”
Mellors said.

University
receives
1 settlement
 for mice,
  rat deaths

By Matt Groff
. Asst. News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
has received $228,000 in an out-
of-court settlement of a lawsuit
concerning the death ofimore
than 2,000 mice and rats.

The accident, which occurred
on July 21, 1988, was a result of
a heating malfunction in a
 building used for research at
._c-.-«.3343 Forbes Avenue. The
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute,
which is a affiliated with Pitt,
was conducting the experi-
ments in the building rented by
the university.

According to George P.
Faines, a lawyer representing
Pitt, the problem was an emer-
gency heating system in opera-
tion during the middle of sum-
mer.

“An employee noticed the

unusually high temperatures
between 88 and 100 degrees
Fahrenheit,” Faines said.
“Maintenance workers were
notified, and they tried to fix it,
but the next day the system was
still pumping heat.”
. The 2,000 mice and 150 rats,
all involved in immune—system
research, were found dead or
nearly dead, according to
Faines. .

“Pitt was forced to set up a

federally and privately funded,

Counseling Center helps attack procrastination

Many students come to the
Counseling Center because of
problems . with procrastination.
The -nature of this problem
varies from student to student.
Some students can 6nly ener-
gize themselves when the task
is especially meaningful to
them. Others avoid beginning a
project because they fearlfail-

ure. Students also procrastinate

because of a lack of confidence

in their skills, as well as for

many other reasons.
If this is a problem for you, it
might be helpful for you to

make a list of your typical pro-

crastination tactics. For exam-
ple, do you consistently under-
estimate the size of a task, write
and rewrite the opening para-
graph of a paper or reward
yourself with a nap before you

.start to work? I

Think about the tactics and
excuses you employ to avoid
doing your work. Write them
down and add them t0..y0ur list
as you discover more. The more
you own up to these self-defeat-
ing strategies,
the less power-
ful they
become.

A n o t h e r
major reason
for procrasti-
nation is that

 

time, establish a time frame for
accomplishing it and follow
some approximation of the fol-
lowing steps:

-Visualize how you will do the
task step by step in your mind.
°Determine how
much time you
will work on the
task each day and
stick to it.

-Do n'ot wait
until you “feel”
like getting start-
ed. Stick with
your plan.

people set
huge, vague
goals which

are virtually unreachable. Then
they become anxious and over-
whelmed and the procrastina-
tion begins.

You will increase your
chances of success if you estab-
lish one measurable goal at a

-Watch yourself
—— refrain from making your
usual excuses toavoid working.
°Focus on one step at a time.
°Get beyond the first obstacle.
Don’t let the first problem you
encounter demoralize you.
-Reward yourself after you

have made some progress.
-Remember, your effort doesn’t
have to be perfect. Even an
effort that does not meet with
instant success is valuable, and
every effort is worthwhile.

-At the end of the time period,
review what you have accom-
plished, note the thing you did
well and the thing you could
have done better and incorpo-
rate what you have learned into
your next assignment.

There are many other ways to
attack a procrastination prob-
lem. Whatever approach you
use, try to avoid the guilt trips
when things don’t go as well as
planned. Guilt only increases
your anxiety and worsens the
procrastination problem. Accept
your failures, analyze what

went wrong and remain deter-

mined to do better.

blood every eight weeks.

The Central Blood Bank also
said there are many ‘misconcep-
tions about the blood donating
process: ‘ '

-Giving blood will not hurt.
There is a slight pinch on the
inside of the arm and a ﬁve to
12 minute wait.

-Unless you are anemic, most
past histories of having a low
iron count do not eliminate you
from giving blood.

-CBB is the main supplier
of blood products to over 35
hospitals in Western
Pennsylvania. Every day CBB
needs over 700 blood donors to
support the daily needs of
Western Pennsylvania’s
patients. 7

-If you decide to donate blood,
CBB advises that you do not
drink any alcoholic beverages
within eight to 10 hours of
donating blood. It is also strong-
ly recommended that you eat
complete meals before donating
blood.

You will be given a snack and
a drink after your blood dona-
tion. '

If students have questions
concerning their eligibility for
blood donation, there will be an ~
on—site nurse to answer them.

 

 

   

 

  

Let them stay ‘ «

One _of America’s most prided attributes, at least until

recently, was the fact that "this country is a melting pot.
Whether our _lineage is from‘ Europe,. Africa, Asia, etc.,
the United States is a mixture of countless nationalities

_ and cultures. The blood, sweat and tears of those who

journeyed to America to make a better life are directly

, responsible for America’s greatness.

But with the recent fall of Communism in the former

Soviet Union, the United States doesn’t have an arch . ,

enemy any longer. The Cold War has melted and to jus-
tify our economic woes and hardship the American
people are increasinglyiising immigrants, whetherlegal
or illegal,’ as scapegoats. _

But it’s not just a problem that is growing among the
populace. It— is being voiced over and over again bythe

l leaders of this country in political speeches to win

points among the electorate. _

Nowhere is this ideology more ‘prevalentthan in
California. Republican Governor Pete Wilson is getting
much mileage out of anti—immigrant rhetoric.

,California’s painful recession is to blame for the most

part. i —
And even though there are roughly two million illegal

aliens in California, and they undoubtedly drain the sys-

tem, Pete Wilson’s weekly lashings are just his cow-

, ardice coming through. Here we have a governor who

has not performed as he should have and is desperate
to lay the blame somewhere. Hey Pete, it’s not just the
fault of the Mexicans! . .

No one doubtsthat the ever increasing ﬂow of immi-
grants into this country isn’t causing problems. It is.
According to The Wall Street journal, the number of
illegal immigrants rose from three million to four mil-
lion over the last decade. And ‘legal ‘_ immigrants are
soaking up’ what jobs are available, various resources
and social services. ' ‘

But “demonizing these aliens,” as the journal put it, is
playing a very dangerous. game. We, along with our

‘leaders, ‘need to look to the ugly anti—immigrant" senti-

ment which is currently spreading like wildfire across
the European continent and leaf througha history book
which charts the rise of anti—Semitism and other bigotry
in Germany between the two world wars. We needto
do some thinking. . V ,

Continuing this way will only make the time ripe

4 for some serious oppression. When foreigners are

picked out and murdered in Florida,‘ what can we
expect next? ' . V

Mayor Richard Riordan of ‘Los. Angeles isnot pleased
by this anti-immigrant.sentiment. “If you remove every
illegal alien tomorrow, you’ve really caused a depres-
sion,” he said. The goal, according to Riordan, should

be to better control the ﬂow of illegal aliens, but the _

tremendous challenge which must be endured is to
handle our problems at‘ home without causing hatred
and ugliness within our borders.

Face of Fascism

. Judging from the recent
report about a Brazilian death
squad killing seven homeless
street children in front of a
church in Rio de Janeiro, it
should be increasingly obvious
what the face of the emerging
new world order is really like.

It is the face of fascism. Don’t
attempt to help poor people; If
they become too annoying or
too big an eyesore or if children
are so desperate that they steal
— just kill them!

Don’t rest easy! This Third
World Brazilian model of the
future is coming gradually to
the United States. The tremen-
dous crime wave, the L.A. rebel-
lion, the homeless, the sorry
state of public education, the
cuts in public services, etc. are
all indicators of this. We can
stop it only if ordinary American
citizens become educated about
the causes of these things and
organize to confront the rich
and powerful! I

This letter is in respo_nse to
the story “SGB revises leader-
ship retreat policy,” which
appeared in the Oct. 18 issue.

A_lthough the revised‘ policy

may be a step in the right direc-

tion (surprisingly), it is certainly
NOT enough.

To my favorite administrators
in the student activities office,

dearest board members,

Allocations Committee members
and, of course, our leader
President Brody, I offer the fol-
lowing criticism. You cannot
look at only the cost per person,
you must also take into account
the total cost. .

Take the following two cases
to illustrate this point.Case A:
SGB has its annual retreat (cost-
ing $15O per person per day) for

not merely the most powerful
student groups as was possibly
the case last year.

After all, isn’t the purpose of

Editorial inaccurate

In regards to the Oct. 18,
1993, 7799 Pitt,N€wS editorial on
“Victims of bias".

The editorial asks: Where in
the Hill District do you see
police composites of suspects in
connection with one of the

many homicides and assaults‘
that have been committed in‘

that area? .

Where in the Hill District 01
East Liberty do you see or hear
of cooperation, as to suspects ol
a crime, between the police and
the community?’ a

It is a sad day in America
when depressed neighborhoods
make a non-committment as to
the safety they deserve and all
resources available.

Phils treated unfairly A

Could a newspaper columnist
slander a team anymore? I
asked myself this question as I
read the preview of the National
League Championship Series.
The writers, to be generous,
ripped the Phillies apart. R

Now let me remind you that
the team they verbally abused
controlled the Eastern Division
for the entire season. True, the
Phils are not the most reputable
team, they often lack the grace
and class of others, but the one
thing they do possessis an
adamant determination that is
evident in every single game
they play. And even though
they do not have multimillion
dollar players that dazzle the
fans, every player has a sense of
loyalty to all of their teammates.
They give 100 percent no matter
what. They do not have certain
f‘supersta1's,” they have a team of
stars.

As far as Philadelphia fans are
concerned, we may be obnox-
ious, but we support our tams
through thick and thin, not just
when a league championship is
at stake, as do the “fair weather”
fans of Atlanta.

And even if the Phils do not
end up on top, they will have
the satisfaction of knowing they
gave their all to turn around a
last place ballclub, and they did
it together.

Pitt gets semi-breather at Rutgers tonight

I By Brian Gallagher

Sports Editor

After a five-game schedule
from hell that included a whop-
ping ﬁve top-25 opponents, Pitt
(1-6) gets a bit of a reprieve

_tonight.

No, the team doesn’t. play
miserable Temple. That “as-
close-to sure—wir1” doesn’t take
placed ‘til Nov. 20.

,’ Rather, the Panthers travel to
the New Jersey Meadowlands
to face Rutgers University for

an ESPN Thursday night‘

matchup.
The Scarlet Knights — just
15-point favorites against the

Panthers — enter the Big East .

matchup with a tolerable 4-3
overall, 1-2 in league play.
Though the Knights are cur-
rently on—pace for their third
consecutive winning season,

Rutgers has yet to beat a.

nationally—ranked opponent in
‘93 with wins over Colgate (2-
5), Duke (2-6), Army (4-3) and

Temple (1-6).

A weaker opponent, right? A
chance for a Pitt win? Yes ..
and no. -

Let Pitt linebacker Jon
McCray explain.

“I think we have a chance to
win,” McCray said. “But we’ve
got a chance to win every time
we play.” «

Huh? Ohio State? Notre

— Dame? McCray continues.

“I don’t think it matters who
we play. You’ve got to play
hard every week. It doesn’t
matter the opponent,” he said.

Ok, so the Panthers are more
worried about self-improve-
ment than the talent level of
their opposition. How about
their astute. head coach? He’s
bound to reﬂect on the relative

talents of Doug Graber’s Scarlet V

Knights, right?

Fat chance. Try Rutgers’ new
facilities . . and the rewards of
playing on Thursday night
national television.

“I feel we had to [play on

ESPN Thursday night] to get the
resources we need,” Majors
preached. “I’m certainly count-
ing on this to help improve our
facilities.”

Majors most certainly _is
drawn to preach about funds,
facilities and support in light of
his prospering opposition.

Led. by third-year coach,
Graber, Rutgers — the
mediocre heel of Eastern foot-

ball throughout most of the

‘80s — has straightened up its
act in-abig way. Its most
notable advancement is a
42,000-seat stadium, currently
under construction - and slated
for completion in 1994.

Of all that impresses Majors
about Rutgers, it’s the school’s
improvement in facilities.

“If anything, I might be
somewhat jealous [of Rutgers].
That’s what we’re fighting for."

While the Pitt program will
reap a tidy sum of approxi-
mately $300,000 from the
tonight’s game, there is still a

game to be played. The key to
the outcome of this Big East
clash could be injuries —-— the
Panthers will likely be without
leading rusher Curtis Martin,

out with an undetermined

shoulder injury. Rutgers will
see the return of 1992 leading
rusher Bruce Presley, who

missed the past two games‘

with a separated shoulder.

The combination of Presley
and Big East leading rusher
Terrell Willis (904 yards, 12
TDs) should have a field day
on Pitt’s‘ run defense, a unit

that yields nearly 270 yards a-

game. _

PITT NOTES: Pitt leads the
all-time serieswith Rutgers 9-1.
The Scarlet Knights only win?
The 21-16 Pitt loss last season
at Rutgers, despite 395 yards
passing by Pitt quarterback
Alex Van Pelt. Pitt’s last win in

the series came in 1991 — a

22-17 squeaker that guaranteed
Paul Hackett’s squad a winning

S_2 ‘ THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday October 28, 1993

It's a damn good thing the FCC's jurisdiction doesn't encompass the realm

of live theatre. Otherwise we'd never get to hear the gritty, rhythmic and

often sexually graphic language that has carved a career for David Mamet.

The playwright, who has always had one finger on the pulse of Everyman in
America and the other perpetually in the bowl labelled controversy, does not
disappoint us with Oleanna, a play riddled with misunderstandings and sexu-
al innuendo. Oleanna is about a college stundent and her professor and the
lack of communication that snowballs into accusations of sexual harass-
 ment. Mamet forces audiences to think about how men and women use

power in a situation where there is no one clear cut solution, only varying

interpretations.To coin a cliche, there's a hell of a lot of gray in this drama..

The Great Ape Machine

by Heidi Glenn

 

There just may be a secret club-of taste makers

plotting and planning trends, cult heroes and

future heavies in the biz. Or, it could just be a
lucky star is beaming down to blues hounds and
ciybabies who need that 1-4-5 progression to soil
Kleenex. Could it be that members of Royal Trux,
John Spencer Blues Explosion and Lydia Lunch
have been kissed by the ghost of Robert Johnson’

Ehtan Buckler, founder
Kentucky’s, King Kong and semicult hero himself,
may or may not agree with the previous state-
ment, perhaps just insisting that pot head blues is
where it’s at, cat. As a former member of sparse-
rock wonders, Slint, he and fellow member, Britt
Walford (also of Squirrel Bait), left the band and
started King Kong in order to quell stomachs
caused by “superficial” aspects of the ever-shal-
low rock scene. Four years later, their unaffected
hushed honkey tonk has endured, and after two
hyped 7” and now two full-length LPs, King Kong
is apparently still disillusioned and high on
Kentucky fried blues/ rock.

The band’s new Drag City release, Funny
Farm, dips into the kitsch grab bag and pulls out
silly and recognizable fare masked by Buckler’s

of Louisville, A

monotone vocals and Amy Parton’s imitation of
Deborah Harry’s saucy hustle. This LP is just plain
goofier than the group’s Homestead release (in
1991), Old Man and The Bridge, evidenced by its
interpretation of “White Horse” (if ya wanna ride
.. snort) and by the repetitious drone of Lipps,
Inc.’s Funkytown on “Dirty City Rainy Day.” Also,
look for call and response gibberish and refer-
ences to both cartoon dogs and the Duke broth-
ers deputy cop, all basted with irony a la Buckler’
s ﬂat voice. '
Just like Old Man, Funny Farm spruces the
Exile on Maifnstreet Stones sound with hunkering
bass and guitar and lazy, creeping keyboards. For
a confident blues number, “Bad Cat” struts with
Kentucky soul, harmonica n’all. As if the group
was following up on Old Man’s credo, FEEL
GOOD NOW, Funny Farm lets you pout, bob and
do the dirty deed to humble blues.
joining King Kong at the BBT on Tbzirsday for
an over—21 romp are locals, Pop Gun, zubo’ll be
arriving straigbt from its bideaway bungalow on

Jane Street, and Hep Cat Dilemma, which fea-

titres members wbo used to call tbemselves

Last Splash ' '
-The Breeders
4AD/Elektra

Kim Deal used to be known only for
her bass playing and rare lead singing
with the Frank—Black-led Pixies. But a
lack of activity in 1989 gave Deal the
opportunity to form her own band. Co-
‘founded with Tanya Donelly, who was
then with Throwing Muses, Deal put
together the Breeders. The result was
Pod, the Breeders 1990 debut album.

With the Pixies broken up, Deal again
found herself with the opportunity to
make another Breeders’ album. The only
problem was that Tanya Donelly had
already moved on to form Belly. Deal
fixed the problem of a missing guitarist by
recruiting her twin sister, Kelley Deal, and
teaching her how to play guitar.

So now, with Kim Deal singing and
playing rhythm guitar, Kelley Deal play-
ing lead guitar, Josephine Wiggs retum—
ing on bass and Jim Macpherson joining
as drummer, the Breeders were ready to
get to work on a new album.

, ! .
soundings

What the group turned out was Last
Splash, an album which should start tum-
ing heads. Kim Deal’s singing on Last
Splash is as emotionally charged as it was
on Pixies songs “Gigantic” and “Carabou.”
This combined with the madly-driven gui-
tars and enchanting rhythms make this a
much more powerful album than Pod.

On this album the Breeders combine
some lighthearted but hard—sounding
songs along with more serious ones.

“Cannonball,” with its hypnotic
bassline, crunching rhythm guitars and
lyrics like, “I’ll be your whatever you
want/The bong in this.Reggae song,” is
nothing but hard—rocking fun. This song
combines the distorted, driven guitar
sound which was a trademark of the
Pixies with the sense of humor that Kim
deal seems to have brought to the
Breeders.

“Cannonball” is immediately contrasted
on the next track by “Invisible Man.” This
song about a lost love is led by an angry

guitar, and with the lines, “He’s the
Invisible Man/count the bubbles in your
hand/The southem skies/ and the summer
sites/that’s all that’s left behind,” it shows
that Deal can write serious lyrics, too.

On an album which features serious
emotional appeals along with more light-
hea-rted and amusing songs, “Divine
Hammer” has to be the most comical
song on the album. When Deal sings, “I’m
just looking for one divine hammer/I’d
bang it all day/Oh, the carpenter goes
bang, bang, bang,” I couldn’t help laugh-
ing at the phallic metaphor contained in
the song with the most pop feel to it on
the album.

Overall, the Breeders progress far
beyond Pod with this work. While the
guitars sound a bit like the Pixies at times,
Kelley Deal’s work on guitar tends to give
the group a bit more originality. Also, Kim
Deal’s lyrics don’t have that dark side that
Frank Blacks always seemed to have. So
if you are going to miss the Pixies, or just
like great music, try listening to Last
Splash.

  Mule kicks this Week at the WPU

Detroit's not really been
known for anything but cars
and crime, but a part of that city
will visit Pittsburgh in the vis-
ageof Quarterstick Records
recording artists, Mule, this
Friday night. Mule offers up an
order of southern—style" stomp
with a side order of midwestern
crunch.

The band’s first vinyl was the

"‘I’m Hell” single, which was

backed by an attempt at a clas-
sic Bee Gee’s tune. The band’s
self—titled debut album came
out on the Chicago label earlier
this year. Its original rhythm

section featured a pair of ex-

Kimball (skins) and Kevin
Munro (bass). .
Hoot and holler provided by

S P.\X/. Long. A new drummer has

been found since. The group
plans to put out an EP in the
spring of '94.

The band has played here
once before,’ but it probably
won’t not‘ admit to it. It was the
Upstage sometime in ‘92. The
members were working out the
kinks in the still, but now the
machine puts out a finer swill.

Openers will be locals

Liverball (Ripe Records), which
offers aggressive sounds in the
AmRep vein, and Blunderbuss
(Homestead), which will fea—

of new vocalist, Mike, who
once performed these duties
with the Northern Bushmen.

Goth Fest

It’s the end of October, and that means time for certain
members of this society to dress up like Mary Shelley and go
to "a Goth show. Normally, however, Pittsburgh residents
with a penchant for Dead Can Dance, Anne Rice and color-
less clothing would end up sitting at home with the black
light on — but not this year! This Saturday night the
American Legion in Squirrel Hill will host an evening devoted
to the dark featuring Washington, D.C.’s Strange Boutique
and the return of our own ethereal favorites, The Garden.

Gothic music is based in the dramatic and the poetic, and
fans of the style will find no lack of this in Strange Boutique.
On the 'band’s latest album on the Bedazzled label, Charm,
Richards makes poetic references’ to Odysseus and Lorelei, as
well as to Charles Manson, all in her neon swirl voice.
Meanwhile, ex-Beefeater guitarist Frederick E. Smith, ]1'.,
plays shimmering chords to provide that all—important
Victorian atmosphere. The music, combined with visually
dramatic performance, should satisfy the 4 A.D. fan.

Perhaps more important to this show, however, is the

return of The Garden to a local, live performance. After a

three year hiatus since its _last show with England's And Also
the Trees, The Garden returns with an album soon to be
released on Bedazzled. Always beautiful and stimulating, the
band’s music also occupies that earlier English, ethereal style.
Its presence should makethis show a must for anyone inter-
ested in Gothic psychedelia.

Strange Boutique and The Garden, plus Richmond
Virginia ’s Siddal, will play an all ages show, 8p.m. on
Saturday night at the Squirrel Hill American Legion, 5857
Forbes Avenue. Call 521488] for more information.

Parrish took the logo (minus the
“E”) & is currently using it for
his record label, PMD Records.
E-Double has a phat new solo
contract worth about a million
& a phat new album.

No Pressure, the long—awaited
solo debut, almost lives up to its
hype. Just by skimming the
album, you know who made all
of the EPMD funk. He rips lazy-
styled rhymes all over heavy P-
funk, Zapp, James Brown, Sly 8:
the Family Stone breaks (noth-
ing at all new for thisbrother).
Songs like “Stay Real” bring the
grungy funk through. With a
heavy funk bassline, Sly Stone
breakbeat & a Zapp chorus (I
don’t know what it’s,saying.),
this song will deﬁnitely put you
into a bobbing frenzy. “Swing
It Over Here” provides ill sam-
ples with Redman freakin’ a
totally different style. “Female
Species” has a phat bassline &
a slow, thumping beat. On this
track he freaks a story about
hookin’ up with beautiful
women. (This is a'CD bonus
track, 8: it may not be on the
cassette.) “The Ill Sh*t” has a
phat Zapp "‘I Can Make You
Dance” bassline & a drumtrack

. used once before on the album

(check: “Hittin’ Switches”).
This song has Erick teaming up
with Kam & Ice Cube, turning
out something very obese. The
star of the album, in my estima-
tion, is “Erick Sermon.” This

song takes the Blind Alley loop,
adds funk bass‘ & a sample from
the old Heavy D & Biz Markie
joint We Write The Songs stir
that up with him chanting,

-“Who am I? E — D, the green-

eyed bandit,” & singing,
“Heeeeyyy, Erick Sermon!!” &
you have the bomb!! That joint
is helliﬁed!

Overall, the album is good,
but it has a few dull points.

After a while, he can put you to
sleep with his lazy ﬂow. That’s
why I’m glad he had people
make cameos (in addition to
those mentioned, Shadz Of
Lingo & newcomer Keith
Murray). E has definitely
shown the world that he can
hold his own. As long as he
“stays real,” he’ll be in there for

"life.

Charlie Hustle ‘

Pitt soCcer’s Charlie W/asson leaves bis mar/e on Big East top guns

Byjack Becker
Staff Writer

Charlie Wasson is on his
mark  as always.

Wasson, a defensemen on
the Pitt soccer team, is shadow-
ing his opponent — a Canisius

forward. The two are engaged _
in a game of cat and mouse .

where Wasson depicts the cat.
Wherever the mouse goes, the
cat is there to pounce on him.’
No matter to Wasson that the
Panthers lead the contest 5-O

(en route to a 9-0 rout) with-

the ball deep in the Canisius
end. ‘This is no" time to relax.
Wasson doesn’t let up, and his
prey isn’t permitted out of arms
reach. a

“He is pure hustle,” Pitt for-

.ward Eric Prex said.

Charlie Wasson simply
spurns any opportunity for an
opponent to score a goal on
_him. He takes that sort of thing
rather personally. .

Wasson, ‘a junior from
Ringgold High School, is Pitt’s
top marker and head coach Joe
Luxbacher says, “one of the
best in the Big East.” I

A marker is a
defensemen whose job
it is to be a human
shadow to an oppos-
ing forward that has
been singled out as a
dangerous goal—scorer.
Therefore, Wasson’s
job‘ game in and game
out is to matchup with
the enemy’s' top gun and shut
him down.

Wasson is extraordinarily

‘good at his job.

“He’s likebubble gum  he
sticks to guys,” defensemen
Bob Dyer said. “He’s done it
with the best in the league.”

Wasson has gone one—on-one
with the best the Big East has
to offer and held them all
scoreless. In fact, Wasson has
relented only one goal in each

1992 rookie of the year Tom
Keegan and St. John’s All-
American Huey Ferguson.
Shutting down Ferguson ear-
lier this year was particularly
satisfying for Wasson because
the St. ]ohn’s star scored the

only goal against him in 1992.

“My main personal goal .com—

ing into the season was to not

Wasson said. _

ropped between the

_ arnegie Mellon.for—
ﬁward gained half a
istep on him and
ifound the‘ net from
£25-yards out. Wasson
still describes the play
with a hint of shock in his
voice.

“It was just a mistake,”
Wasson said. “It was only half a
step.“I was just really mad.

“As a defender, no matter
how well you’ve played, if you

let one goal in, then it’s a bad
game.”

Nevertheless, Luxbacher said
that Wasson has been “by far”

the team’s steadiest game play-'

er, and that he consistently
gives his best effort.

“IfI had 10 Charlie Wassons,”
Luxbacher said “coaching
would be such a joy. You
know you can just write his

name in and he’ll give you a

good game.”

Wasson has embraced his
role as a stopper on the team,
which is something Luxbacher
says not every player is willing
to do. -

“To Chuck it’s not about
scoring  it’s about shutting
down the other guy,” midfield-

The Panthers closed out the
match with a 15-10 third game.

Ann Marie Lucanie and
Jennie Driscoll led the Panthers
with eight kills. Driscoll, who
has been playing despite shoul-
der problems lately, was the
most efficient hitter, with only

two hitting errors and a .335

attack percentage. She also had
two solo blocks and five block-
ing assists.

“Jennie played really well,” '

Braziel said. “I won’.t say she

 Wasson

Continued from page 7

I er Jeff Porter said. ’

Wasson’s teammates and
coaches refer to him as a quiet,
unassuming, focused, hustling
workhorse. Pitt assistant coach
Chris Karwoski called Wasson
an “invaluable link to the
team,” and said that he had to
be “one of the top MVP candi-
dates on the team.”

Whether it is not allowing his
man to turn on him to get a
shot off or sliding in to break
up a pass, Wasson goes full-
throttle the entire game.

“You can’t relax at all during

' the game,” Wasson said. “You

have to be intense for 90 min-
utes. If you make a mistake
and lose your focus, you’ll get
beat bad.

“I don’t let the guy out of my
reach,” Wasson said. “If he’s
within an arms reach, I can
push him and pull him. At
Connecticut a fan yelled down
to me, ‘Hey number two, do
you want a pair of handcuffs?’ I
thought that was a perfect com-
ment for the way I was playing
the kid.”

Wasson also puts forth an
equal effort in practices as well.
Practice is just like a game to
him. Karwoski said that he has
even had to tell Wasson to
“tone it down, it’s just practice.”

“What’s the sense in not
going 100 percent? I’ve never
gotten any better by not going
100 percent,” Wasson said.

Wasson, a psychology major
who hopes to get into occupa-

tional therapy, began playing
soccer in a league at the age of
five

In high school Wasson col-
lected 11 varsity letters —— four
each in soccer and wrestling
and three in ‘track. Wrestling
added to Wasson’s preparations
for the job he now holds with

. the Pitt soccer team.

“Wrestling helped give me a
strong work ethic. If you don’t
work hard, it’s extremely obvi-

ous on the mat because it’s
one-on-one out there,” Wasson
said. ‘
Despite the fact that Wasson
has spent his Pitt career as a
defensive hawk, one of his
most meaningful moments
came at Syracuse last Sunday

on the offensive side of the ‘

ball. With Pitt trailing 3-1 at the
half, it was Wasson blasting a
35-yard shot into the upper
corner of the net, propelling his

team to a 5-3 comeback win.

“That felt really great,”
Wasson said. “I hit the best
shot ofmy life. I went crazy
when it sunk in that I scored
from that far out. I just started
screaming, ‘I could shoot the
ball.’’’ '

Wasson’s last remaining goal
for the season is to make the
Big East playoffs, and that road
travels through Georgetown on
Sunday.
