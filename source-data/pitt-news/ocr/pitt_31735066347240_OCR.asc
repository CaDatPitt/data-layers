 Union, Univ. Reps Clash
Over Returning Police

at

''i

-n,

 ’

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

Striking Campus Police and
University representatives agree
that some striking police have
returned to work, but they disagree
on the speciﬁc numbers.

Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham reported yesterday 43 of
the 70 campus police who went on
strike last week, have returned to
work as of yesterday morning.

Striking officers - deny this
statement, using a roll call sheet to
show only 27 ofﬁcers, including
seven non-union members have
reported back to work.

Six of the men who are reported to
have returned to work crossed the
picket lines last Tuesday, following
the strike /vote Monday night,
Lieutenant Ji_m Heagy said.

Chief Union Steward John Forgie
said these six men were asked to

honor the picket, lines, although 

they were not union members.
One Union member who returned
to the work force said, “I found that
management didn’t lie in reference
to theataiiumber of men who had
already crossed the lines. Once I
found out that over 20 men were
back on duty, I thought it was
ridiculous not to go back to work.”
“I found that there was no
organization in the Union striking
efforts and so I came back to work,’ ’
Union member Rodger Dixon said.
Bev-0-Matic employes who ser-
vice vending machines at Pitt
campus also returned to work
yesterday. v.
Leslie Frank, Bev-0-Matic Presi-
dent indicated,'yesterday. the ﬁve
men who regularly service Pitt’s

vending machines may have had to p

be laid off if they did not service the
vending machines at Pitt.

“The entire ’University is not
covered by pickets and where there
are no pickets, I expect my men to
cross and to ﬁll the machines.

Lily Tomlin Charges

Pitt Foul P|ayiWith Sex Suit

BY RON NYSWANER

Lily Tomlin, noted comedienne,
labeled the University’s charges
against Sylvia Roberts, an attorney
for Sharon Johnson who has ﬁled a
sex discrimination suit against Pitt,
at attempt to “manipulate and
exhaust” the attorney and divert
her energy to “defend herself,
rather than her clients.”

Police Allege Parking
Fines Issued gUnfair|y

BY DEANNA ipulsn

Amalgamated Plant Guard Union
Chief Steward John Forgie charged
a Campus Police lieutenant yester-

day with selectively ticketing his A
illegqglly parked vehicle in the 

Towers garage on Forbes Avenue

4 yesterday afternoon. ,

Striking police also complained
the ﬁne was issued with city tickets

. that were “supposedly unavailable

to campus polcie” since the advent
of the New State Meter Vehicle
Code this summer .. prohibiting
campus police from issuing parking
tickets, but permitting the city
police to, ticket on University
property. ‘ '

The Pitt Police are petitioning the

state of Pennsylvania for an -
alternative to the parking provisions

of the present vehiclecode.

Forgie said his pickup truck, used
to make a ﬁre wood delivery to the
picketing police, was one of six
vehicles illegally parked in the
driveway. /

Two were reportedly blocking the
loading dock at the end -of the
driveway. Two owned by- striking
ofﬁcers were immediately moved,
Forgie said, and one Bev-0-Matic
delivery truck “parked him in.’-’
Union Steward Art Dorman also
said the officer who issued i the
ticket, Lieutenant Walter Waters,
ignored his complaints about -19
otherillegally parked vehicles in the
Towers parking garage reserved
only for permit holders.

Forgie said Waters told him the
Bev-0-Matic truck was not being
ticketed because it was used to
make a delivery. _

Furthermore, Waters said later,
the Bev-0-Matic truck, which was
parked illegally when he . asked
Forgie to move his vehicle, was not
blocking Forgie’s car when he
returned to issue the ticket.

Waters said not all illegally
parked cars are ticketed because
“We only issue tickets when
someone phones in a complaint?’

Redistribution of power in
America could result because
Jimmy Carter's margin of victory
was provided. by the black vote,
Congressman Ronald W. Dellums
(D-Calif.) said at a Black Week
lecture yesterday.

Carter lost to Ford among the
white population, 45 per cent to 55
percent, but received about 90
percent of the black vote, according
to Dellums.

Blacks must translate their
election of Carter into something,
Dellums said, and not let themsel-
ves become another co-opted
American group. - . ~

Tomlin described the Univer-
sity’s denial-of Johnson’s tenure in
October of 1971 as “blatant sex
discrimination,” and sai_d ‘the
“lowest tactics” are being used by
the University to ﬁght her suit.

Johnson, a bio-chemistry profes-
sor, ﬁled suit in 1973, charging the
University with violation of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and 1966, and the
First and 14th Amendments.

Sylvia Roberts, Johnson’s attor-.
landmark
injunction for this case in 1973, was
charged with “solicitation” this
summer by the University attor-
ney’s for violating’ professional
conduct. '

The “solicitation” charges stem
from a letter released by ‘Roberts
concerning the three sex discrimin-
ation cases against Pitt that Roberts
represents. —

Tomlin, whose Monday night
performance was dedicated to
Roberts, is active in the “women’s
and human’s _movements” and
researched the cases in question
before coming to Pittsburgh.

She called Roberts “a righteous
woman,” because of her involve-
ment in civil rights cases, many of
which she represents without a fee.

Keith ‘Burr, Assistant to the
Director of Legal Services at Pitt,
said “the University had a valid
claim against Sylvia Roberts and a
right within the (legal) profession to
do what we have done.” -

' Burr also said theUniversity has
“every intention to abide by the
decision” of the grievance commit-
tee currently reviewing Robert’s‘
cases. He said the University
“refuses to try (this case) in the
press.”

impossiblefor him to be elected to

It is now the primary responsi-
bility of blacks to challenge and
change American foreign policy,
Dellums said. _

Dellums cited the recent sale of
14 sophisticated ﬁghter planes to
Kenya as an -example of the
“American foreign policy mental-
ity.”

America is selling huge amounts‘
of munitions to African nations in
hopes of splitting the African
continent, into eastern and western
power blocks, Dellums said. \

Both Frank and Forgie agree
Bev-O-Matic is a service to the

not be made to suffer because. of the
strike. -‘

Earlier, striking officers claimed

Bev-0-Matic was forced to cross the

University.

Tom Albert. Director of Auxilary

“No pressure has been applied
by the Univesity. If Bev-O-Matic

Pitt-CMU

BY RICH HARRY

Pitt is nearing completion of a
wide-range study that may pave the
way for sharing computer resources
with Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU).

According to Allen Kent, Director
of Communications Programs at
Pitt, a ﬁve-man study team, in
conjunction with CMU, is ‘exploring

‘a range of options in computer

I

5’

resource sharing between the two
schools.

‘ ‘Results of the study could mean
a formation of one center site
containing a precise selection of
hardware, under the direction of
one person,” he said. “Or, we may
decide to do nothing at all. Between
those two extremes, are a wide
range of options.”

Kent said a ﬁnal report disclosing
ﬁndings of thestudy is expected in
mid-December, and added, “We’re
now at the point where an ad hoc
committee has been formed to
consider the technical aspects and
alternative costs of a merger.”

The study is being funded by a
$36,000 grant from the Buhl

— Foundation.

Joseph G.K. Miller, Executive
Director of the Pittsburgh Council
on Higher Education, stressed a
CMU-Pitt computer merger is just
one consideration of the study, and
indicated smaller area colleges may
be involved;

“Pitt and CMU may be
considered suppliers of computer
resources, while smaller institu-

Qtions like Carlow, Chatham and La

Roche colleges could be considered
their receivers or clients,” he said.

Kent also pointed out a
conference at Pitt last.April
featured seven speakers from
various Universities which have
already ‘implemented coordinated
computer activities. The confer-

.ence, Kent said, focused on input,

criteria of success,” and the
problems of computer reso’urce
sharing.

“In my opinion, that conference
was exemplary in offering input for
computer resource sharing,” he
said. “However, it was difficult-to
determine a general consensus of
the conference because everyone
was listening to it from a different
point-of-view.”.

False Alarms
Pulled In

City ﬁre trucks responded to a
fire alarm pulled after detection of
a kitchen ﬁre on the ninth floor of
Holland «Hall at approximately 7:30
-p.m. Monday and to a false ﬁre
alarm pulled in Tower B at about
12:30 the same evening.

Lieutenant Charles H. Brevard of
the Pitt Campus Police said the local
ﬁre department called the earlier
alarm false probably because the
small blazes were extinguished by
Pitt Police before the ﬁre depart-
ment reached the building.

Although the alarm Monday was

‘warranted, Brevard counted ﬁve

false alarms since the beginning of
November, two in Frick Fine Arts
building, two in the Towers and one
in Brackenridge on election night.

Each false ﬁre alarm costs the city
approximately $250. '

“One perturbed ﬁreman said,
“After the next false alarm were
getting you out of bed at three in the
morning.”

Campus -Police Chief Curt
Graham said last week, “The next
time a false alarm is pulled in the
quad we’re, evacuating every one in

“There are black niggers,

The way in which we are
“niggerized" comes in a number of
forms including racism and sexism,

BY TODD JAILER

The policies of the university at

all levels are formulated by the.
. administration for the students.

Right or wrong, the only student
voice recognized by the admini-
stration as legitimate is that of
Student Government. Therefore,
Student Government has the
responsbility of representing stu-
dents by advocating their interests
and needs, and pressuring the
administration to incorporate stu-
dent interests into university
policy. ' V

. For the past few years, Pitt
policy has been to a consistently
whittle away at the position within
the university. Tuition has been
raised four times in the lastﬁve
years. making higher education
increasingly difﬁcult for all stu-

' ‘dents, especially minority and

working class students, to afford.
Program cutbacks, politically based
ﬁrings, and larger class sizes

‘degrade. the quality of education

offered. The decrease from three
to two ﬂoors in the Student Union
allotted to student groups denys

Homecoming is supposed to be a

“Did I hear what?”

“That/ It sounds like a ﬁre

I »  faintly‘ heard the buzz origina-

18th floor. People continued to mill
about on my ﬂoor. Again I pushed
the door to the stairwell open and
saw people scurrying down.

“Fire on 18! Fire on 18!” It

spread like wildﬁre and suddenly
everyone, including myself, was
evacuating the rooms. Itook off my
slippers, put on my shoes, grabbed

door. '
Someone asked whether "he

heard, and people semi-responded.
The condition seemed more serious
with the alarm blasting in my ears.

Police were on the phone.

‘Firemen in full gear-—hats, fire-

rushed through the revolving doors,
streamed through the crowd and
proceeded to go to work. It all
seemed so classic. The only ones
missing were Steve McQueen and
Paul Newman.

As more ﬁremen and policemen

outside, circle the Tower, and look-

for signs of the blaze. No smokewas

I asked a girl who was upstairs
what she knew about the ﬁre. The

-St. John’s Alcohol and Drug .

Rehabailitation (ADR) Center is one
of the most comprehensive facilities
in this area, according to Jack
Donohue, Director of ADR’s
Consultation and Education sec-
tion. ‘

The ADR Center, which islocated A

near the Woodsrun section of
Pittsburgh, offers services to both
the alcoholic and the drug addict,
although it is designed mainly for
the treatment of alcoholics.

 The Center is involved in a

program with Pittsburgh’s District
Attorney’s office, which is called
Accelerated Rehabilitation Disposi-
tion (ARD). This program takes
first offenders for non-violent
alcohol related crimes, especially
drunken driving, and instead of jail,
they submit to treatment and
evaluation, in addition to being put
on probation. '

The Center, according to detox-
counselor Joe Bradley, is closely

gassociatedwith Alcoholics Anony-

J7

mous (A.A.).

“The whole program is oriented
around A.A. They have the highest
rate of recovery of all treatment

‘ centers or groups. We have an A.A.

meeting every Sunday morning,
and A.A. members often visit our
patients," Bradley said. '

There are three main program
components in the alcoholism
treatment. The first is called
“detoxiﬁcation,” which is a 5 to 7

..C.lay program. The patient spends

it

' section of the hospital has a 28 bed_

all of this time in ADR’s
hospital-like facilities where he or
she is under the care of doctors and
nurses. The patient is informed of
the dangers of alcohol and the
effects of alcoholism. The “detox”
unit has a 49 bed capacity. .

The next component is the 28 day
rehabilitation program, during
which the patient again stays at the
ADR hospital. During this phase,
the patient is evaluated and
educated, through the use of ﬁlms

and lectures. Group and individual ‘

therapy groups are also an integral
part of the rehabilitation. This

capacity.
The third part of the program is

Women who want to learn ‘ ‘what
they need to know to survive on the
street” should be interested in the
self-defenseclass for women taught
by Richard Lengyel.

Lengyel is a research assistant in
Pitt’s Life Sciences department,
and has a black belt in a Korean
style of: karate. He owns and
operates thelnstitute of Progress-
ive Martial Arts at 4613. Liberty
Avenue in Bloomﬁeld. . -

Lengyel. ‘said a minimum‘ of
physical strength is necessary. for
the practical and efﬁcient approach
toself-defense which he willteach.
Participants will be able to use the
skills they learn in the six-week
course immediately, according to
Lengyel. ‘'

The women  the class will learn,
for example, who to walk down the.

of a. car safely, and how to stand in'a'

“In this segment of rehabilita-
tion, the patient participates in
weekly group or individual counsel-
ing sessions,” Dennis Palkon
ADR’s Director of Research and
Evaluation, said.

The Center is currently evaluat-
ing its recovery rate.

“I’d say about 80% of. our
patients show at least some sign of
improvement,” James Grady, Af-
tercare Coordinator, said.
care is a critical: part of the
prograin.”

At the ADR Center, the patient is
in complete control of his or her
treatment. ’

“The patient decides what will
happen to him or her. The patient
can easily leave the program
anytime he or she wants to, ’ ’ ADR’s
Director of Rehabilitation John
Vasil said.

The Center is funded by various
federal, state and county agencies,
in addition to receiving money from
St. John’s General Hospital. The
idea of an alcoholics treatment
center was started at St.« John’s
about 20 years ago by Dr. Charles
Gabos, who is still involved with the

~ADR Center.

. The Center's staff itself consists
of many recovering alcoholics. _Joe
Bradley is a alcoholic who has
remained sober for over two years.

‘ ‘Almost 50% of the staff here are
We say
recovering because an alcoholic is
never cured,” Bradley said.

‘Another program being carried
out at the Center is the Bureau of
Business Rehabilitation. This
program is funded by the state and
federal gov’t for treatment of people
who will probably re-enter the labor
force after achieving sobriety.

Many Pitt graduate students and
alumni are working at the ADR
Center, according to Donahue.
Donohue is currently finishing his
Ph.D. in Education at Pitt. Dennis
_Palkon is a graduate of Pitt’s School
of W Public Health and is now
ﬁnishing his Ph.D in social work.
And James Daly, head of the Center
and Director of Therapy, is a

an umbrella as defense weapons,
and how to take the feet out from
under an assailant-

Lengyel says there are psycho-
locical concepts underlying the

‘ self-defense, such as fear. Women»
‘ will be taught to use their fright by

“turning their fear into aggression
towards the attacker.” Instead of

succumbing to_the assailant, girls I

will be able to startle or frighten
him. _ .

“Americans don’t have the
patience to learn classical martial
arts, ”_ Lengyel said. He is prepared
to do away with tradition-and “get
to the essence of self-defense.”

He calls his school Progressive
because the martial arts are “ﬂuid,
not stagnant.” His methods
incorporate many of the martial
arts, ' including ‘judo, boxing,
wrestling, and karate.

The six-week course begins this
week adn meets every Tuesday and
Thursday‘-from 7 to 9 p.m. at 4613 ,

  Youth City Gives  
Thanksgiving Feast p

BY MARK PRESCOTT

_, If you are interested in helping
--others enjoy Thanksgiving this year
while enjoying it yourself, then
Youth City of Pittsburgh has just the
‘answer for you, according to Bill

O’Neill, mayor of Youth City, Inc.

"Youth City is a , nonproﬁt
volunteer,’ organization made up
mainly of young adults interested in
the betterment of mankind,"
O'Neill said. “We reach out into
areas that are least thought of and to
the individuals who may be rejected
because of labels placed on them by
society. "

Youth City, which has its ofﬁces
at 304 Ross St., downtown, is
holding its A sixth, annual free,
pre-Thanksgiving dinner at North
Park on Saturday, Nov. 20. “We
have had great success with it in the
past and I am looking forward to it
greatly this year. But we do have
some problems,” O'Neill said.

Youth City, according to O'Neill,

needs more volunteers to help with

» the program and to buy advertise-

ment in the Friendship Directory, a

program booklet used to fund the
event.

Each person who buys space in
the Youth City program booklet is a
co-sponsor of the event, O'Neill
said.

Some ofthe co-sponsors from Pitt
this year are the Student Govern-
ment Board, the Alpha Phi Omega
fraternity and the Gamma Sigma

Sigma sorority.

_ “'l'he main purpose of these
dinners is to give us a chance to
bring people from mental institu-
tions, rehabilitation centers, penal
institutions and senior citizen
organizations to a place that has a
friendly atmosphere. This way we
can show them that even fhough
they may not have families, they do
have friends who care.and want to
help," O'Neill said.

Youth City was founded by'

O'Neill in 1968, originally to help
runaways who were lost and 'didn’t
know, what they wanted to do.
However, O'Neill_’said, it now
reaches mainly « ffsfend-aways"
(people sent away to school, which
includes college) and the “walk-
aways" (people old enough to leave
home).

“We are called Youth ‘City, not ,

because we only help the young, but
because we think young. We will
help anyone "who comes to us
regardless of their age,
religion or beliefs," O'Neill said. .

One-fact that might be surprising ~'

topsome people about Youth City,
according to O'Neill, is that almost
all of the volunteers involved in it
are high school students seeking to
go to college or are

presently attending college-

“Crime by college graduates is i

on the rise at an alarming rate and
this is because they just can't ﬁnd
good jobs. The crime rate also is
rising for people still attending

college. This is becausethey feel i
that they can make easy money,from A
crime," O'Neill said. _ ' '

“We at Youth City try to prevent ~
all of these people from turning to ~
crime by giving them other —
activities that they can become '

involved in," he said. "However,

I ‘this is not all we do at Youth City.
We also act as a referral agency and ' '
a place where people can come to -

just,talk out their problems and
receive guidance. We also try to

‘ find jobs for some people and help ,

people in any sort of -trouble that

they may face." '
Sherrie Cummings, Youth City's

administrative assistant, and

O'Neill sometimes work 17 to 18'
-hours_a day. “We do this, not

because we have to, but because we

enjoy our work and feel we are doing '

something worthwhile. I don't feel-

I'm helping people anymore than“

they're helping me,” O'Neill said.

Tom|n's Troupe

a

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Frank Zappa never, ceases to amaze me. Every year, right around
November, he and the Mothers of Invention come into town and
completely blow me away with their brilliant weirdness.

Brilliant weirdness? What else could you call a band that is tighter
than Oakland parking, with all members being masters of their
respective instruments, but who insist on singing about “Stinkfoot,”
“Black Napkins,” and good old “Dynamo Hum”? .

Following Zappa’s introduction of this year’s Mothers of Invention
line-up Friday night atthe Syria Mosque, it was straight into the absurd.
“Does anybody in this good crowd want to kiss the Stiiinkkkfoot?”
demanded Zappa, in his extremely satirical voice. He held up the green
plastic foot and a young male volunteer planted a beauty right on the big
toe. He’s walking around, at this very moment, with “Stinkfoot

has waiting for her, a powerful
dignity and sincerity come through,
making Tomlin’s character too real
to he laughed at.

In another, Tomlin portrayed a
man on the make, guzzling beer and
clumsily approaching women in a
singles bar. Her physically and
psychologically correct characteri-
zation pointed out that such
attitudes insult women, and that
these attitudes come from loneli-
ness, frustration, and fear.

’ Some of Tomlin’s comedy came
from skits that reversed the usual
power structure. She puts normally
socially impotent people in posi-
tions in which they can be heard

from or at least be noticed. This-

helps us realize the importance of
ordinary people, from telephone
operators to ﬁve-year-old children
to even members of an audience.
And Tomlin does make the
audience members feel important.
Near the end of the show, a woman
left her seat, and walked to the
stage, offering her hand to Tomlin,
W}'.lCh she accepted comfortably.
The familiar Tomlin creations
were present also. Edity Ann
answered questions from the
audience (Where do babies come

“Sometimes I think that what

that they may have heard me say. A

that.”

Tomlin seems uninhibited on
stage. Her movement, when out of
characters, is erratic and uncontrol-
led. She seems to say things just as
they enter her mind. She seems
more comfortable asperformer.

At the reception for her after the
performance, she happily gave
autographs, even encouraging
those around her that were
“holding out” to come forward. As

, autograph seekers approached, she

reached out to them with her hands,

and maintained eye contact with

them as she talked, proving that she-
is not struck with her “star
quality.” She lived up to the

message of «her opwer—structure
skit, her behavior showing her
recognition that those around here
are as important, perhaps even
more so, than herself.

PPA Show Relaxes
Into Subleties

BY MREA CSORBA

It’s a good show, but that’s not
an unusual appraisal -of a Pitts-
burgh Plan for Art (PPA) exhibi-
tion. This time, the added bonus of
the PPA King Center exhibit‘ is its
mellow viewing. The two
exhibiting artists’ works /carry
subtle ties and intricacies that are a
heartening break from the hard,
cold qualities in most Steel City
artists’ works.

In the Victorian mansion that
serves the PPA membership from
the outskirt hills of Highland Park
(until their new townhouse resi-
dence on Craig Street is readied for
opening), Eva LuDamianos’ sunny
acrylics and Peter Calaboyias,
sculptures and sketches team up
for a show that is refreshing in its

“unoverpoweringness. ’ ’

discovering (the positiveness of
space, women artists started
depicting objects as negative,
featuring space as positive.

It is through their innovative
perception that we were shown the

Damianos paints space, pure
open space, that with its deceiving
simplicity and beauty arrests the
viewer’s glance gently.

It was (women artists of the.
sixties that discovered that what-

until then had been labeled
‘negative’ space, was something
substantial enough to serve as the
visual focus of a painting, Until

trees, around the negativeness of

Disco Lady Belts Out 4th 

BY PAMELA EUSI

Vicki Sue Robinson, Vicki Sue
Robinson '
RCA APLI-1829

There's no doubt about it, Vicki
Sue Robinson can really belt out a
song. And she proves this in her
new album, Vickisue Robinson.

Yes, here she is folks, the disco’
lady of “Love To Hear Percussion”
fame. That hit single was from her
ﬁrst LP Never Gonna Let You Go. _
Robinson is an artist who knows her
way around the entertainment
world. She’s been on TV_ talk
shows,'in commercials, and in ﬁlms
(Columbia’s To Find A Man, and
Warner Bros. Going Home). She
debuted on Broadway (in hair at 16,
and later appeared in Jesus Christ
Superstar). She has numerous
concerts, recordings, and modeling
assignments to her credit, and for
highlight, she did a stint as lead
singer in a rock band (Sadistic Mica
Band, sounds kind of kinky, eh?).

RCA i gave her a recording
contract at the tender age of 21 and

- in the space of a year and a’-half two

albums have sprnng from that

. _ the disco beat keeps it that way.

  

couple moments when Robinson
gets to go beyond the funky beat.
The album opens with a jumpy
jivin’ disco track “Daylight,” that
gets off the ground well,has some
great background vocals by Robin-
son and Gordon Grody and a good
sax solo. But after’ ﬁve minutes of
the song, oneo\i‘s ready to listen to
something else.’ The song runs for
almost two and a half minutes more.
A real pity that length ruins a good
song. Another good’ feature of

, “Daylight” is the set of snappy,

off-the-cuff vocalizing ‘near tth

termination of the track. F

Side two leads off with two ‘cuts

“Let Me Down Easy” is a welcome
change from Robinson disco to the
Robinson serious, slow number.
Good music, fine lyrics and
sensitive instrumentation lend it
class and Robinson’s voice. lends to
gold, maybe even platinum, if
discovered by the DJ ’s in time.
“How About Me” is yet another
disco track but there’s something

different about the song that is

catchy and will probably score high
on the charts, The percussion

and the vocals——again ,all by
Robin'son——are on top throughout
the length of the song.

“Now it's up to us to prove it,”
said an elated Pitt coach Johnny
Majors before a standing room only
crowd (probably the ﬁrst ever) at
the weekly media*lunche:orf yester-
day at the Greentree Hpliday Inn. 

Prove what?  courseprove -the ":3
ranking as the number one
collegiate football team in the
nation, as selected by both the AP
and UPI polls on Monday.

“I’m very happy,” Majors
continued rather somberly, “but I
don’t feel like I’m king of the road.‘

.If you’re the best, you don’t have to

be going around the world telling
everyone that you are, but you just
have to prove it.”

With a 9-0 record going into this

week’s clash with arch-rival -and

upset (17-14) winner of last year
West Virginia, the Panthers polled

49 ﬁrst place votes from the 63
-writers and reporters. who vote in
the AP poll. Pitt also collected 1,226‘
out of a possible 1,260 points, while
runnerup -UCLA (8-0-1) received

seven ﬁrst-place votes and 1,093

points.

Last week’s front-runner Michi-

' gan dropped to fourth place
after losing to Purdue, 16-14, on
Saturday, while Southern California
moved up a notch from fourth to
third

Majors was more open than ever
with the media in regards to the
pol1s—an area, along with the
bowls, which he more than often
would rather not discuss.

“We have enough to handle this

we do sometimes concern ourselves
with them.” ’

Perhaps Majors is bitter because
of what happened to his. Tennessee
team in 1956, when with two weeks
remaining in the season, the‘. Vols
held the nation’s top spot, but were
outpolled by Oklahoma for the
championship in the ﬁnal balloting.

~ But as long as the Panthers keep
winning and manage to ﬁnish 12-0,

game they may choose,’ there

All-American by breaking the all-time scoring mark for a kicker last

should be little doubt‘ as to which
team is tops.

Asked if the players had a
preference as to which bowl they
would want to attend, Majors said,
in place of the.‘,two;',§ilent guest

V  _ Vfched thatijtage yet.’?:j
Aﬂndt;-againv-~:when questioned ‘of:
another possible upset loss to West
Virginia, Majors returned with,
“We haven’t reached that stage
either.” , ‘

So it was a‘ typical Majors
interview, but this time the players

re sticking close to their coach in
also taking a vow of silence.

“We don’t have a lot of time to
think about it (being ranked number
one),"’ said Cavanaugh. “We have

As usual, Majors took time ‘to
praise his squad, which, of course,

. .ma_r_e than deserves it, saying that ..

 ‘ientirhe, offensive? line was
awarded the offensive player of the
week‘ award for their performance
as a group, and also reserve-
quarterback Tom Yewcic, “who
reached up and got something he
didn’t have before,” in leading Pitt
to wins over Louisville, Miami,

/Navy and Syracuse during the

absence of Cavanaugh to an ankle
injury.

But on a higher note, tailback
‘Tony Dorsett has again 'been
recognized as a member of the UPI
Backﬁeld ofithe Week. On the AP
side, the Back of the Week
distinction went to Purdue safety
Rick Supan, who led the Boiler-
makers with 11 tackles and kicked

. the winning 23-yard ﬁeld goal in

Purdue’s win over previousy

6 unbeaten and top-ranked Michigan. _

Dorsett and the Panthers will surely
-not argue with that selection.

Pantherettes A wait Bid

BY JOHN FINN‘

The Pantherette spikers raised
their record to 23-3 after a
triangular match with Edinboro,
Ohio State and Indiana of Pennsyl-
vania, Saturday at Trees Hall.

Pitt began by thumping Indiana
and countered by defeating a tough
Ohio State team. The Pantherettes
won both matches two games to
one. ’

But then Pitt ran into arch-rival
and nemesis, Edinboro. The
Pantherettes opened powerfully
"and assumed a 14-10 lead in the ﬁrst
game of the match, but Edinboro

Pitt highly touted freshman spiker,

Edinboro (won the first game
16-14 and trounced Pitt in the
second game." "We had trouble
adjusting after Andy got hurt,"
freshman setter Mary Lou Susang
said. And by the_time they did,
Edinboro had built - up _‘and

H '1 hey say that opportunity knocks

face Edinboro for the third time at
the regionals, and no doubt they'll
be working hard for the reverse

BY STEVE srnnnr

A month and a half ago, Pitt water

 polo coach Miguel Rivera went

apparently a little too far out on the

J diving board when predicting his

ﬂedgling squad would have little or

'_ ‘no trouble in the Middle Atlantic

Conference (MAC) and come away
‘with an undefeated" league record.
Well, folks, he was right. Not
only did the Panther poloists wind

' I up with an -11-0 MAC record, they

also made waves at West Point,
NY. last weekend and swam away
with the league title and the Art

 , Bonifas Memorial Trophy, named
9 f for an Army goalie who was killed in

Korea, as their prize.
The Panthers rolled over Cornell,
11-8, before edging last year’s

(MAC champion Bucknell, 11-10 in

the title contest to draw the number
one seed for the conference in the
Eastems to be held this Friday and

V Saturday at Trees Pool.

“This was really a team affair,”
said a happy Rivera, whose team
captured its ﬁrst trophy in only its
second season in the MAC.
“Everyone played really well and
we're peaking for the Easterns.”

In the Panthers’ victory over
Cornell, Jorge Machicote led the
way with eight goals despite fouling
out half way through the third
Helping out in scoring
-were Mike Mere (three goals),
Butch Silva (two) and Peque Rolan

’ and Mike Schoeﬁeld (one_ each).
"Rivera also credited Silva and Luis

Toro with supplying half of the

‘assists between them.

Bucknell reached the conference

' ﬁnals by downing Army, 11-8, in a
’see-saw battle but could not repeat
_ its championship season with a win

over the Panthers. The goal-getters
for Pitt included Machicote (four,
again fouling out), Mere (three),

Rivera's Goal Fulfilled

and Silva and Barry Ford (two
each).

“The score is not a reﬂection of .

the game,” Rivera said. “We were
ahead in the fourth quarter by four
goals and I put in my substitutes.
Bucknell managed to close the gap,
but we managed to keep the lead. ”

' Rivera also said the margin of

victory would havebeen greater if -
not for failing on six extra man .

situations in the first quarter “that
should have been in.” '

“Our key plays were our defense .

against Bucknell’s fast breaks,”
said Rivera. “We stopped six or
seven of them. That would have
made the score a lot closer, but we
took ' advantage with interceptions
and came back down and scored.”

Pitt enters the Easterns with a
15-3 overall record and still another
prediction by the conﬁdent Rivera.

‘‘If there are no upsets or no
surprises, it’s going to be Pitt and
Brown in the finals,” he said. “We
have a really good chance. (Now,

here it is:) We should win the
Eastems.”
Matchups for the Easterns
include, Friday: 12:30 p.m., Army
vs. Yale); 2 p.m. Brown vs.
Bucknell; 4 p.m., Pitt vs. Army;

Panther Harriers Mauled
By NCAA-Bound Lions

BY DAVE McDONALD I

(Pitt’s cross country team
ended its dual meet season Friday
with a loss‘at State College at the
hands of Penn State.
championship-bound Nittany Lions
mauled the Panthers, 19-38. .

The Lions and the blistery
weather proved to be too much of a
match for the Panthers. Pitt got off
to‘ a good” start in the race,
commanding the lead for the ﬁrst
mile and a half, but soon after that
State star George Malley and his
troops caught the Panthers. After
that, the race was all Penn State.

Pitt’s "Mel Boyd did manage to
stay with Malley for a while, but
was unable to stick with him when
Malley took off after the third mile.
Malley ran his last two ‘miles in
close to 9:15, which is an incredible

The NCAA”

ﬁnish for a race. Malley will

deﬁnitely be a threat at the NCAA
meet later_ this month.

Boyd ﬁnished a distant second
with a time of 24:53 or 50 seconds
behind Malley. The other top four
runners for Penn State ﬁnished
soon after Boyd in a strong team
ﬁnish.

Pitt’s pack wasn’t far behind the
Lion’s—Nort McDonald ﬁnished
seventh with a time of 25:29, Tom
Herrmann eighth in 25:33 (his best
time over ﬁve miles), and Terry
Wile ninth in 25:35. Mark
Studnicki ﬁnished back in the pack,
in twelfth place.

The Panthers ended.their dual
meet season with a 2-3 record and
have hopes of improving next year
with the returning lettermen being
mainly upperclassmen with a good
deal of experience behind them.

Field Hockey Women Optimistic

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The women’s ﬁeld hockey team
"wrapped up their ﬁrst season ever
Saturday morning with a tri-meet at
Youngstown State. The Panther-
ettes were trounced 8-1 by the host
team, but collected a win from
Baldwin Wallace College which
forfeited the match.

Youngstown led Pitt at the end of
the ﬁrst half, 4-0. In the second,
Sue Swick was shifted to center and
rammed in Pitt’s only scpre on an
assist by Ciny DiGiacomo.

“They’re an experienced team
but we played a good game,”
observed goalie Robin Brust. “It

was awfully muddy. The goal cages
were solid mud. It was hard to get
good footing.”

The Pantherettes ﬁnished the
season with a 5-4 record, which is
quite an accomplishment when
you consider that it was the ﬁrst
season for ﬁeld hockey at Pitt and
beginning teams usually ﬁnish
below .500. The record is all the
more outstanding when you realize
that nearly half the team had never
before played ﬁeld hockey.

“We feel very pleased consider-
ing the inexperience of the team,”
Assistant Athletic Director Sandy
Bullman said. It was Bullman’s
idea to bring ﬁeld hockey to Pitt.

But when the ﬁnal decision to add
the sport was made, it was already
mid-spring, long after the top high
school talent was already recruited
for other schools.

“There’s going to be a big
difference next year when ‘ we

recruit ﬁve or six experienced

players,” Bullman said.

Leading scorer for the Panther-
ettes this season was left inner
Cindy DiGiacomo. The 5-3 junior
had played for the women’s
"basketball. team, but had never
picked up a ﬁeld hockey stick until
this season when scheduling
problems prohibited her from

- making the morning basketball

practices. DiGiacomo came
through with nine goals for the
ﬂedgling team, including four in
Pitt’s home" match with Chathamp
College. »

“I think I surprised myself,”

DiGiacomo admitted. ‘ ‘I don ’t think .

we’ll go out and be undefeated next

year, but Ithink we’ll ‘be a lot better. ‘V
With what we learned this year, we

can advance ourselves. ’ ’

The one person all are quick to‘

credit with the team’s success is
Coach Janet McDowell.

‘,‘ Without a coach like her, I don’t
think we’d ‘have played to well
together,” said Brust. “Everybody
enjoyed hockey because of her
attitude.” -

“I think the coach did a fantastic

job," Bullman agreed. “It was her I
patience that brought the kids-

together. ’ ’

' said.

‘ “I didn’t really expect them to do
as well as they did,” McDowell
said. A “Especially with as many
beginners as we started with.”

At the beginning of the season,
McDowell said she would focuse on
fundamentals and positioning.
Looking back, she noted that “you
never ﬁnish with fundamentals. I
think now they have experience
which you can’t teach them—they
have to‘ learn it themselves in the
game. The positioning was very
strong at the end of the season.”

“I think Cindy did an outstanding
job as leading scorer,” McDowell
“Of course, Jayne (Coury)
wasn’t far behind. We had Sue
Swick at left win, which helped
move for forward line.”

McDowell cited the defense as
doing a fine job despite their
relative inexperience and praised
goalies Brust and Betsy Firth-
both of them played very well.”

“The team worked very hard.
They're a very determined bunch, ’ ’
McDowell said. “They were nice

‘ players to work with—they had a lot

of hustle.” V

A good recruiting season would
give the Pantherettes the added
boost of experienced players in the
line-up, and it seems likely that this
will (be the case for, the next
campaign—“Coach seems to know
what she wants,” DiGiacomo said.

And so, the Pantherette ﬁeld
hockey team has deﬁnitely made a
good start, but the best is yet to

BY JERRY VILLELLA

The Pitt bowling team con-

tinued its early-season struggle,‘

losing three games to Duquesne at
Strand Lanes last Thursday after-
noon.

After falling behind in the ﬁrst_
game, 843-792, the Pitt team
appeared to come to life in the
second, ﬁghting hard until the ﬁnal
frame. The Dukes’ Mark Resetar

. decided the issue, though, throw-

ing nine strikes in a row for a 237
and pacing an 894-830 Duquesne
win.

The Panthers were unable to-put
on their usual third-game rally, and

this year. T

The most promising aspect of the
Pitt team is that they, like the
season, are quite young. Fresh-

' Geoff Joseph, and junior Al Bryce

CARTER SETS UP EQUAL
ACCESS SYSTEM FOR AIDES

ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga.
(AP)—Jimmy Carter is likely to
make his ﬁrst choices for White
House staff within a week, setting
up a “spokes of a wheel” system in
which a number of aides have equal
access tothe President, his press

. secretary said yesterday.

Jody Powell. told reporters the
equal-access approach results in
more information coming to‘ the
chief executive and also generates

“increased competition among staff -

members, which keeps us all on our
toes.” .

Some presidents have favored a
differe_nt'system under which all
information is funneled through a
"single chief of staff who decides
what the man in the Oval Office will

‘ see.

Carter is on a post-election
working vacation at ’ a secluded
estate on this resort island off the
coast of Georgia. He spent most of
Tuesday reviewing defense and
foreign policy documents prepared
by his transition staff, Powell said.

SICK EMPLOYES BACK
TO WORK

KITTANNING, Pa. (AP)-
About one-third of the production
workers have returned to a
Kittanning electronics plant shut
down six weeks ago when dozens of
employes were mysteriously sick-
ened. '

“The time comes when you start
up or close the door forever,” said
Shelva Koleckon, president of

United Steelworkers Local 8529 and '

one of 100 employes back on the job
Tuesday at Essex International

N Corp.

The plant has 290 employes,

.mostly women, and is one of the

largest employers in this-town about
50 miles north of Pittsburgh.‘

Plant ‘officials said the rest of the _

employes will be called back over
the next two weeks as. the plant
moves toward resuming full produc-
tion. ' ' .. / '
A’ wave_ of stomach _illness and

’ dizziness hit employes Sept; 30, and
I about 70 of them received hospital

emergency room treatment.
