Volume 56 - Number 43

University Sponsors

Mellon Lecturers

The University will sponsor a series of lectures“ by Dr.

Jean J. Seznec, Dr. Ernest T.

DeWald, Dr. Rhys Carpenter,

and Dr. Lionel Charles Knights in the Graduate School of
Public Health auditorium, beginning March 1 and running

through April 10.
The lectures will begin at

‘Theatre 11’
Clpens 2 Plays

Tomorrow

The two Theatre II produc-
tions, “Nine ‘Sons in a Row”
and “Bedtime Story” willbe
presented tomorrow and
Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. on

the 11th floor of the Cathe-
dral.

“Nine Sons in a Row,” directed
by Bill Kingsley, is, according to
Kingsley, “the story of a young
lady who makes a professional
error in the 0ld.est profession and
gets a young ﬂame to bail her
out.”

In one of the scenes the thea-
tre ‘turns into a nightclub, com-
plete with spotlight and piano.
During this scene Gil Lazier will
deliver a 15-minute comic mono-
logue. Bill Powers will accom-
pany him on the drums.

“Nine Sons in a Row" was
writen by Joel Oliansky at the
age of sixteen. The author later
graduated from Yale University
and now writes professionally.

“Bedtime Story” takes place in
Dublin in the 1920’s, and is, ac-
cording to Kingsley, a “rollicking
Irish farce.” It is the story of a
“priggish hypocrite who is taken
advantage of by another young
lady who engages in the oldest
profession.” It is directed by Lar-
ry Heller.

An innovation for Theatre 11 is
the almost complete change of sets
between the two plays.

Admission is free. Tickets may
be picked up at the speech de-
partment on the 11th ﬂoor, CL.

‘Owl’ Promotion
Incliides Balloons

One hundred balloons will be
released into the Schenley Quad-
rangle at noon Wednesday and

The balloons, dropped to pro-
mote Owl Week, will hold slips
of paper representing gifts rang-
ing from a candy bar to a full
down payment on the deluxe copy
of the 1962 “Owl.”

Any student catching a balloon
must return the slip of paper it
held by 5 p.m. Friday to the
“Owl" ofﬁce, 400 SU. There, the
mark on the slip will be matched
up with those on a master chart
to determine the ﬁnder’s gift.

Incl Jed among the gifts will
be 15 $1, 5 $2 and 1 complete
($6.74) down payments on 1962
“Owls.” There will also be one
complete payment on a deluxe
edition -— a $7.78 value.

Studies Atomic Reactions

Dr. A1yea’s major ﬁeld of re-
search concerns the mechanisms
by which atomic chain reactions
are inhibited.

He received his Ph.D. degree
from Princeton in 1925. For the
next few years Dr. Alyea studied
the chemical eﬂects of radium
while at the University of Min-
nesota. At the Kaiser-Wilhelm
Institute in Berlin-Dahlem, Ger-
many, he studied gas explosion
kinetics. These years of research
were undertaken as a Rocke-
feller Foundation Fellow.

After those studies, Dr. Alyea
worked with the Office of Scien-
tific Research and Development in
Washington and in the Paciﬁc
Theatre of Operations during
World War II.

He has also served as visiting
professor of chemistry at Hawaiian
and Mexican Universities, and was
a National Science Foundation
Lecturer at the International Pal-

fessor at the Book Center

Mrs. Jane

Jacobls. author of

Cities,” commented on her book
last Tuesday in the vine Arts
Room of the Book Center.

A resident of Greenwich Vil-
lage, Mrs. Jacobs spent her spare

time walking through East Har-

lem, “questioning the principles
that people use in urban renewal.”
Must Utilize Space

She believes. that all rebuilding
hasn‘t resulted in improvement
because people didn’t. make use of
spaces they should-h.ave. “In re~
building a city, one must ask
what quality is missing here,
rather than what is dirty. City
planning is more a matter of acid-
ing th.ings than subtract.ing,?" she
said. .

Mrs. Jacobs thinks that “cities
should bring together as many '
different kinds of people as pos-
sible, for nothing can take the
placcof human minds, talents,
and enterprises coming togeth-
er.”

“Ideas, like new kinds of art,
food, or shops can be tried out in
cities,” she suggested. “But old
ideas must be left for smaller
places.”

responsi.bilit,y to be interested in

Then, at last ‘Wedncsday’s
review, Dr. Harry J. Mooney, of
the English Department, called
Ivo Andric’s novel, “The Bridge
on the Drina.” profound and
complex, and richly deserving
of the Nobel prize.

He explained that the book is
divided into two meaningful
areas, the concepts of time and
of space. “It does not depend on
a central situation or character,”
Dr. Mooney said.

Spans Centuries

The bridge. which spans the
River D1-ina in Viscgard, Yugo~
slavia, is the central symbol of
the book, Mooney believes. All
events of the story center around
the bridge.

Dr. Mooney feels that “perman~
ence is symbolized by the bridge.
It brings order and serenity into a
chaotic world.” '

 Sense

A University professor outlined eight offenses com-
mitted by this University constituting what he termed “a
serious crisis of integrity” at Thursday’s Senate meeting of
deans, faculty, and administrators. And with these points
the very role of a teacher within’ a university was chal-
lenged and a fresh look taken at his purpose for being here

   at an.

In the ﬁfteen minute report, validity of courses and
reasonableness of loads on professors were scrutinized as
they related to faculty and students alike.

Too often, it was pointed out, concern over oversized

classes, insufficient readers, and the basic purpose of a uni-

versity are looked upon by administrators as complaining
when voiced by faculty members, and immature attitudes

A .. when heard fro mstudents.

Finances was cited as one of the causes of the current
distress. But a more important consideration was the lack
of faculty members in voicing their opinions frankly and
candidly before administrators in an open meeting such as
Senate instead of constantly forming committees to con-
sider problems. It was stated that the faculty. knows best
about the real affairs of the University and should bemore
effectively used in decisions affecting its intellectual atmo-
sphere. , o

The immediate outcome of the report was a suggestion

for a grievance committee and theproposed formation of a_
‘committee to investigate and clarify major problems set

forth in the report. And whether the report accomplished
its purpose of’ stimulating frank and open discussion re-
mains to be seen in future Senate meetings. But while

awaiting those results, a closer look at the contents of the
charges reveal the perpetual problem of teacher ‘versus the

University community.

In the ﬁrst place, thefact that ﬁnances has caused cer-
tain distresses cannot be denied, but the risks\taken at the
other extreme of losing ﬁnances to promote education can-
not be overlooked altogether. At that same Senate meeting
a report from the Budget Policies Committee pointed out
that the University’s failure to offer a ‘condensed core of
undergraduate business courses has seriously affected the
number of applications it might otherwise receive under the
old system. Although no statistics were cited, the loss, of

revenue seemedsubstantial enough to warrant at least an ,

awareness of its impact on the total ﬁnancial picture. But
no thought was given to return to the old, at the sacriﬁc

I of the newer and more educational system. '
As for the oversized classes and overloaded teachers, ,
: there seems to be some inconsistency. If statistics mean any-

thing, there presently is one teacher for every 10 students
on campus and 40 percent of this faculty have Ph.D.’s. Of
course, it does not necessarily follow‘ that all classeswould
contain only 190 students, but there is the suggestion that
some professors, at least, are burdened only with one or
two classes while others seem to becarrying the brunt of
the load. ’

And so it becomes clearer that while the substance of
the text is important, none of the problems raised isireally

new to the University. But it did open a more realistic ap-

proach to these problems by questioning and challenging
the role of .a teacher in a University. ‘

‘ Here seems to be the dividing point. As one Senate
member stated “teaching is secondary to the frontier of
academic achievement.” For those who believe that teach-

I‘ ing must be a central consideration, such a statement is

exceedingly hard to digest. But the opposition leads inevit-
ably to the idealistic compromise attributed to a Harvard
colleague. It is better to have no one unless he is a good re-
searcher and an excellent teacher or a good teacher and an
excellent researcher. A A

As has been stated, this is the «idealistic extreme, but
the fact that it is in the minds of all concerned is a healthy
sign. Too many, administrators tend to shrug off the prob-
lem of publish or perish. But here wehave an honest con-
sideration and appraisal of the problem..If the Senate can
come to grips with this very real division it is very prob-
able that many of the recurring problems of a University
will be solved along with it.

A about the group, I had long ago

  Peace Pleas

When Howard Harawitz, president of the Uni-
versity’s Student Committee for a Sane Nuclear
Policy, telephoned The ‘Pitt News office and invited
me to accompany his organization on its‘ weekend
excursion to Washington, D.C. to participate in the
national-peace demonstration, I had serious reser-
vations about accepting.

I hesitated in answering because I feared that
my pre-conceived opinions con-
cerning SANE and its paciﬁstic

writing an objective news sum-
mary of their activities. From
the little information I possessed

decided that those students who
were “in SANE” were merely
refugees from Bleecker Street
whose minds were filled with a -
kind of 1930 fruit-picker Marx-
ism and an inexorable desire to .
bogeyman everybody into dumping all of their
arms into the deepest part of the darkest ocean.
But Harawitz, like all good peace-pushers, was

. a salesman. He, quietly swamped -me with press

releases and other literaturepfrom anti-war organi-
zations and left me to mutter. After a few days,
I ﬁnally muttered “What the hell?” and called him
backl consented to travel with his pressure group
to the Capitol, observe their activities, read their
picket signs, walk with them, talk with them, sleep
on a church floor with them, attend their rallies
and listen to their campaign songs.
Variety of Demonstrators

I did. I _now view the Student Committee for a
Sane Nuclear Policy and the other participating
paciﬁst groups in a different light. _

I ﬁrst wanted to establish whether or not all

of these demonstrators were, as popular belief

had it, “refugees from Bleecker Street.” They were
not. A good deal of the members of SANE, or the
Committee for Non-Violent Action, or the Student
Peace Union or any other participating groups did,
in fact, look as if they had just crawled out of a
Village coffee house with the roaches. And at ﬁrst
glance: it appeared that /one simply could not
demonstrate for peace without owning a board,
guitar, grubby ‘sweater or pair of leotards (where
applicable). But an equal number of demonstra-
tors sported I-Iarvardian haircuts, inﬁnitesimal’ coat
lapels and saddle-soaped British walkers.

My conclusion was that, although: a leaﬂet
from the conservative Young‘ ‘Americans for’Free-
dom, who were counter-picketing the peace plead-
ers, called them “bearded. artists of surrender,”
the attire of those “in SANE” was'as varied as
that of the students who are f‘out SANE.”

‘I was next concerned with the politics of the
picket line. After talkingto a great many students,
from Columbia to Ohio State, I concluded again

 

By Matthew Nevisky ’

that the political thinking of the peace paraders
was as varied as that of our entire society. I en-
countered many outspoken Socialists, but at the
same time found many New Frontiersmen, several
Republicans, and even a girl from the University
of Connecticut who believed that “Robert Welch
has been grossly mistreated and misunderstood.”
And again, unsurprisingly enough when compared
to the general public, a good deal of the students
had no political leanings whatsoever.
Signs Tell S1-ory
‘ What then draws together so diversiﬁed a group
of students —— hipster and Harvardian, Socialist 4
and schlemeil -— into the tightly organized, mili-
tary-like operation which transpired last week?
Perhaps ‘the signs which were carried in the
picket lines before the White House, the Soviet
Embassy and around Lafayette Square illustrate
the answer best. And if Imay filch Rostand’si
outline on “How to Insult a Nose,” I shall present
some examples:

Direct: “Ban the Bomb;”' Harsh: “Nuclear Test-
ing Kil1s;” Witty: “Peace —— the Cause that Re-
freshes;” Romantic: “Hiroshima, Nevermore;” Il-
logical: “The Deeper the Shelter, the Bigger the
Bomb;” Demanding: “No Tests, East or West;”
Simple: “Bombs are Made to Kill People;” Scar,:yf""
“It Tolls for Thee;” Ideal: “We Challenge the so-
viet Union to a Peace Race.” --

Demonsfroﬁng for What?

As expected, the signs themselves show the
tone of the record-breaking demonstration. Some
were deadly serious, others were quaint. Some of
the demonstrators were grim while others were
merely along for the ride. Many students spoke
to representatives of both the United States and
Soviet governments, while one girl from our Uni-
versity carried a sign reading “Repeal the Conally
Reservation,” but when questioned, did not know
what it meant. -

Some of the students may justiﬁably be term-

«. ed “Students Aﬂiicted with Nervous Energy,” but

most of the one observed seemed to be motivated
by an honest desire for Peace, a prize which we
all want. i U’

The results of the demonstration remain to be
seen, but one of their goals was certainly attain-
ed: publicity. Front page coverage and a Sunday
editorial from- the New York Times and equally
favorable space from the Washington Evening
Star was, like the number of students at ,the
picket, better than the leaders could have hoped
for. Correspondents from the Manchester Guard-
ian, I. F. Stone’s Weekly and The Worker were
seen having a ﬁeld day as they noted all aspects
of the demonstration. .

How world political leaders were impressed,
however, will be shown in the international oc-
curences of the near future. :

Analyses Tuition Raise

Editor,‘The Pitt News: M

There has been a great deal of
discussion about the ‘recently an-
nounced tuition increase for the
fall. Much of the discussion.» has
centered on the matter of “justi-
fying” the increase; this is a
quite pointless eﬁort as I will ex-
plain. .

Consider this. When the price
of bread goes up, how much justi-
ﬁcation ‘does that require? The
costs of producing the bread have
increased, so that the retail price
is raised. So too, the costs of
college‘ education
have increased tuition must be
raised. 'It is a matter of simple
economics. Higher education is in
demand. ‘There is a “shortage” of
that commodity, hence the in-
creased price of it.

But somehow it seems that
there ought to be more to it than
that. Consider the frustrated pa-
rent who might reply with some-
thing like, “My daughter is no
genius, but with a college educa-
tion I’m sure she could have some
real worthwhile work.

“She’«s being deprived of some-.

thing she ought to have. Is it my
fault?” Clearly people are not get-
ting ALL the education they
want; but why? Not enough text-
books can be produced? Of course
they can. Not enough qualiﬁed in-
structors can be trained‘? That
doesn’L seem to be a likely an-
swer. , ‘

Perhaps it is just that there
are «more important things to be
done. Yes, that’s it. But NOT what?
is important to society as a whole,
rather only what is “important”
to the making of profits in our
capitalists economy. I
V Consider, for example, the enor-
mous, almost unbelievable efforts
expendedin advertising - count-
less man-hours are wasted in ;con-
tributing something of highly

-questionable beneﬁts to society.

So why do we put up with it?
Because we have been trained to
accept this as “the, proper way of
life.” This is “business” -— such
has been our “education.”

It is those at the top, those
privileged few at the top, that are
directing our manpower resources.
They hold the purse strings; we
do their bidding or starve. Un-
limited, unrestrained education is
NOT conducive to the mai,r3t4en-,
ance of the capitalist ~~i,system;iV

that’s why the reinsare held so
tight. M V

And there’s only one way out of
this rat race, and that is in sup-
porting a program calling for the
immediate abolition of an eco-
nomic society that reduce; every-
thing, including education, to the
level of a commodity.

In. a sane system all goods and
services will be produced for USE
--not for sale on the market. Edu-
cation will be real and not merely
training for a job. This is the pro-
gram of the World Socialist Party

of the United States and its Com-

in other countries.

‘Becket’ Production
By SUSANNE ECKMAN '
Anyone passing by 316 SU. at any hour, is almost sure
to see someone hard at work on costumes for the upcoming
Pitt Players performance of Jean Anouilh’s comedy “Becket.”
Leading the workers will probably be Philip Eck, de-

signer of the scenery and

Around them, on the wall, will be sketches of faceless char-

director of its construction.

acters, wearing brightly-colored?

medieval costumes, also part of
Eck’s handiwork.

 This is the first year that Pitt

Players has done all its own cos-
tuming. “Becket” will be the most
elaborate set yet attempted, with
costume materials ranging from
burlap to fur.

Studies Period Costumes
One of the reasons for the elab-
orate and larger investment, ac-
cording to Eek, is that these are
period costumes. They are suit-
able for many other productions,
including “Saint Joan” and some
of Shakespeare’s historical plays.
The costumes are based on a
study of the clothes of the me-
dieval period, which are then
adapted to the ma... Sketches
are drawn of each costume,’
‘i patterns are made of muslin
for styling and fit. and then the
costumes themselves are made.

Peasant costumes are made
fromburlap sacks, while those of
richer characters are made of felt,
velveteen, silk, or satin. Fur
trimming for some of the costumes
has been obtained from a local
furrier, and chain mail armor will
be rented for the show.

Men Ride Horses

The script calls for men riding
horses, and in the absence of real
horses, celastic copies of a merry-
go-round horse will be part of
some of the actors’ costume.

( Help is needed, according to
Eek, and “work is available for
both skilled. and unskilled labor-
ers. from making dresses to cut-
ting out lions for the coats of
arms.“ Workers will also be need.-
ed during the show for props, cos-
tumes, and make-up.

Program Classics

The University’s Antiqua Play-
ers will present an evening of
pre—classical music on March 1,
in the Supper Room of the Stu-
dent Union at 8:30 p.m.

The performance, which is free
and open to the public, will be

formed in a fomalized sing-song
chant peculiar to the 16th and
17 centuries.

 

Sussman Cites

Youth as Link
With Future

Youth is the link between what
has gone and what must inevitab-
ly come, said Milton Sussman,
guest speaker at the 5th annual
Greek Week Luncheon which -was
held in the SU Ballroom at noon
Saturday.

Sussman, who spoke on “Broth-
erhood” is a lawyer, an adver-
tising executive, a member of the
National Conference of Christians
and Jews, a member of the Pitts-
burgh Housing Board and editor
of the Jewish Criterion.

Purpose of _the luncheon was
the presentation of
awards to the fraternity and so-
rority with the highest QPA for
the previous fall term and the
presentation of the ﬁrst “Frater—
nity Man of the Year” award.

Following the luncheon ap-
proximately S150 Greeks took
part in a. program of workshops
on “How to Better Fraternity
Life.” L

The program consisted of four
workshops, Presidents’, Scholar-
ship, Public Relations, and Pledge
Trainers’, which took place in 119
SU, 306 SU, Dining Room A, and
Dining Room B respectively.

The workshops were moderated
by fraternity and sorority advisors
and representatives from several
national chapters. The purpose of
the workshops, according to Bob
Slotkin, co-chairman of the Greek
Week committee, was the discus-
sion of common problems and the
pooling of ideas as to the solu-
tions to these problems.

Questions of how to decrease
pledge dropouts, how to improve
Greek image on campus, whether
fraternities should. c o - o p e r a t e

-more with each other, and wheth-

er a deferred rush system would
improve overall fraternity scho-
larship were discussed. An or-
ganization co—ordinating the mem-
berships of fraternities and soror-
ities was also discussed.

Upset Win

.._Leads to 15-14: Victory

.. ...,.-.

4

V’ ‘E

By BOB SMIZIK
It looked like another bad
night for the Panther wres-

tlers at the Field House, Sat-

urday, until a sophomore,
who is about as point stingy

as any. grappler in the coun-
try, came on to score an upset to
put Pitt into a lead "they never
surrendered in beating Penn
State, 15-14, before a crowd of
2772. P

The sophomore ‘was Ken Barr
and his 5-3 triumph over Phil

‘Myer was a must for the Cats in 

light of Daryl Ke1vington’s up-

set loss to George Edwards.

That win gave State two vic-

tories for the night. They expect-
ed other wins from Ron Pifer,
which they got, Myer and by
moving Ed Pohland up to heavy-
weight, if Myer won.
Point A Match

That strategy never came about
as Barr boosted his season re-
cord to 7-1. In eight matches this
year Ken has limited his oppo-
nents to a mere eight points, an
average of one a match.

Barr dominated Myer for two
periods to gain a 4-0 lead, but
tired badly in the ﬁnal stanza.
“I was so anxious to beat Myer
that I used too much unneces-
sary energy in the first period
and I don’t have anything left
at the end,” Barr explained.

The way was now paved for
Tom Jeffries to reverse his role
of last week and become a hero.
He did just that by downing Ed
Pohland, 6-3, and clinched the
match for the Panthers.

Dick Walker’s pin of Jeff Ware
merely served to make thepfinal
score closer.

Coaching Pays Oﬁ

Both Barr and Jeffries had

been pinned by their Penn State
'opponents "while in high school
and their. wins last night are
testimony to the coaching ability
of Rex Peery.

FOR A BRIEF MOMENT Pitt’s
Augie Arrigone had control of
Penn State’s Ron Pifer in the
157-pound division. But even
here Arrigone is trying to keep
from falling to the mat which he
did often enough for Pifer to
score a decisive 8-2 win. This
was an expected win for the
Lions. '

Kel'vington’s loss to Edwards
was the big shocker of the night.
Daryl had a 4-2 lead with 38
seconds remaining when Ed-
wards scored_ a. reversal to tie
the match. By virtue of a two

second advantage, Edwards got
a point for riding time.

Rich Martin ﬁnished his dual
meet” career unbeaten by com-
pletely outclassing Denny Slat-
tery, to win 5-0. Slattery didn’t
seem to care about wrestling and
layed on his stomach for most of
the match.

Needed Riding Time

John Zolikoff needed riding
time to edge unheralded sopho-
more Dick Campbell, 7-6. Zolikoff
had a 4-0 lead midway through
the second period but tired and
barely missed losing.

‘Panther Cubs’ Rally Startles Enemy,

But Kent State Survives, '/9-69

By STEVE BAILEY

The Pitt Frosh playing at

Kent State last Saturday, lost

69 to 79. They were losing by 9 points 28 to 37 at the half and
14 points midway through the third quarter. VVhen they
staged a rally and closed the gap to 61-62 with 7 minutes
left to play. However, Kent State held on to ﬁnally win.
After falling behind, Coach Peterson’s team decided to

and half-court press to shake

-“Wk gamble. They employed a trapping zone, man—to-man press,

Kent State’s offense.

This strategy worked very well
as the Cubs pulled to within one
pointof Kent State. However, in
Coach Peterson’s. words, “You
can’t keep taking chances against
a good team and expect them all
to work.” Kent State adjusted to
Pitt’s tactics and pulled away.

Change of Tactics

Kent State started off using a
conventional man-to-man defense.
The Frosh did a good job in set-
ting up easy shots but they had
trouble putting the ball through
the hoop. They did well enough,
however, to force State to change

to a 3-2 zone for the entire fourth

V‘ a, quarter.

Four players for Pitt scored in
double ﬁgures—-Bill McIntyre,
19; Dayrl Ruby, 13; Brian Fisher,
11; and Alex, 10. The high
scorer ‘of the game was Cipreano
for State with 26 points.

 

Peterson had much praise for
the Kent State team, especially

for a boy named Kelly whom he
said was a good ball—hand1er.

First Sweep
In Decade

Ends Season

Pitt traveled to Penn State .

Saturday night with a chance
of bettering last season’s 12-11
record and splitting even with
State on the year. They did
neither, losing 63-55.

 

It was the first time since 1951 i in N

that the Nittany Lions have
beaten the Panthers twice in one
When hearing that Pitt
had lost, one of the few avid Pitt
student fans remarked, “Even
though their record was 12-11, it
was still a losing season.”

This statement bears out an
editorial written not long ago
about Pitt athletic teams just set-
tling for one more win than loss,
that would put them above the
.500 mark. This has happened two
straight years to the University
basketball team.

Last Not First

At University Park it could have
been averted if the Panthers had
played like it was the last game
of the year and not the first.

The players were called for
Walking five times in the last
ten minutes of the game; were
assessed a technical foul for
playing with six men and were
called forgoal-tending. As usual
they got a good start, hitting on
only one ﬁeld goal in the first
ten minutes.

. It was perhaps their usually re-
liable shooting from the free-

igthrow stripe that cost them the
,game.

six. If they could have connected

on these last shots, it would have.

tied the game on two different oc-
casions.

It was the ﬁnal appearance for
back-court.man Tom Maloney and
forward Bob Sankey. The co-cap-
tains contributed 13 points with
Sankey After the
game Bob commented, “Its been
the same thing all year. We should.
have won the game, but we made

some bad decisions and too many
mistakes.”

While Coach Bob Timmons will
have secen returning veterans, ﬁve
of them sophomores, it will take

getting nine.

King copped the senior novice
165-pound class with his game,
scrappy style. Now he has fur-
ther ambitions, big ones, “I
want to go to the Olympics,
that’s as far as I think boxing
should go." His aim right now is
to make the 1964 U.S.A. team.

The sprouting newcomer who
,stands 6-3 in his black boots,
ilearned his tactics in the local
,YMHA, a product of Al Quai11’s
lBe1leﬁeld A.C. center.

“Mr. Quaill can teach me a lot,’’
King exclaimed. ‘He’s a wonderful
man. He didn’t think I was ready
for the senior open, and I'll listen
to him. It takes determination to
stick with him in training, but
if you have the basic desire, he’ll
get it out of you.” He certainly
got it out of King.

“Pitt gave us a hell of a
battle,” commented veteran
Penn State Gymnastic Coach
Gene Whettstone after the
Lions downed the Panthers
521,/2-43‘,~’_> at the Field House
Saturday night. State copped four
of the six possible first places.

Earl McConnell, appearing in
the last. home meet of ill‘. gym-
nastic career, took one of Pitt’s
two firsts by edging St:-ite’s Tom
Seward 279-270. This was Se-

ward’s ﬁrst loss of the season and A

left McConnell with a season re-
cord of 8-0.

"I did my best and be defeated -
‘me,” stated Seward unemotional-p

1y. The general consensus was’
that McConnell had a more diffi-
cult routine. State Team. Captain,
Greg Weiss, agreed. “McConnell
deserved to win,” he said softly.
Weiss Rides Winner

Weiss did some winning him-
self. He galloped to an easy vic-
tory on the side horse by tally-
ing 278 points. His nearest com-
petitors, Pitt’s Roland James and
State’s Ray Cherry, tied for sec-
ond place with a mere 231 score.

The Lions dominated the still
rings and only fought among
themselves for the first two
slots. Larry Yohn captured a
first and George Williams, a sec-
ond. Ed Zamecnik, McConnell,
and Jack Lehner salvaged the
3, 4, and 5 spots for the Panth-
ers.

Pitt trailed 301;é-l71,é- halfway
through the match but narrowed
the gap by taking the long horse
event. Bob Pingatore received 270
points and his sixth successive
victory in this event. ‘Zamecnik
followed with a 260 and a second
place.

“Weiss did his usual superb job

on the parallel bars,” said Pitt
Coach Warren Neiger. That sum-
marizes the performance that sil-
enced 2772 spectators who watch-
ed in disbelief as the master of
the P—bars tallied a 288 score and
another ﬁrst.

Pitt, down 421/2-371/2, went into
the high bar competition needing
eleven of sixteen team points to
win the meet. Six was all they
could come up with as Weiss and
Seward provided a one-two punch
that knocked the Panthers out of
the match.

Three More Records Set

Mermen Sink Ohio U, 65-30

In the ﬁnal home meet of the season, the Panther swim-
mers defeated Ohio University, 65-30 at the Carnegie Tech
pool last Friday night. The victory was the seventh for the

UNITED WE STAND

The entire academic world is agog over the success of the
Associated Colleges Plan ~-~.A_CP, for short. I mean, you go to
any campus in the country these days and you will see students
and faculty dancing on the green, blowing penny whistles,
grabbing each other by the elbows and yelling, “About that
ACP, Charley ~—-like l.ro'w!"'

And who can blame them? The ACP is a plaii not only simply
brillia.nt, but also brilliantly simple. All it is, is a. loose regional
federation. of small colleges. l..et’s say, for example, that in a
given i'egion we have a group ol‘ small colleges, each with its
own academic specialty. Small College No. 1, let’s say, has a. fine
l:i.ngii:i;);e clepartnient; Small College No. 2, let’s say, has a. tine
science departinent; No. 3 has a ﬁne niusic clepartvment ; etc., etc.

Well sir. under the ACP these various colleges ferlciate. A
student in any one of the colleges can take courses in the spe-
(:ialt.y of any of the other colleges and-—l1ere’s the beauty part!
-he will receive credit for the course at his home college. Thus
he enjoys all the advantages of a big university without losing
the comfy coziness of a small college!

Well sir, you can see what a good idea the A01’ is. I respect-
fully submit, however, that just because a thing is good is no
mason not to try to make it better. Like, for instance, Marlboro
Cigarettes. Marlboros were goodfrom the very beginning, and
people found out quickly and sales zoomed. But did the makers
of Marlboro say, “Okay, we’ve got it made. Let/s relax”?
Well sir, if tha.t"s what you think, you don’t know the makers!
They did not relax. They took their good Marlboros and kept
improving them. They improved the ﬁlter, improved the blend,
improved the pack. They 1'esearcli.cd and developed tirelessly,
until t0(ln.y Marlboro is just about the most admirable cigarette
you can put a. match to. There are, in fact, some. people who
ﬁnd Marlboros so admirable they can’t bear to put a match to
them. They just sit with a. single Marlboro in hand and admire
it for ten, twelve years on end. The makers of Marlboro are of
course deeply touched by t.his-- except for E. Rennie Sigafoos,
the sales manager.

But I digress. The ACP, I say, is good but it can be better.
Why should the plan be conﬁned to small colleges? Why should
it be conﬁned to a. limited region? Why not include all colleges
and universities, big and small, wherever they are?

Let’s start such a federation. Let’ s call it the “Bigger Asso-
ciated Colleges To Encourage Richer Intellectual Activity”--
BACTERIA, for short!

1

 

t r///’

What a bright new world BACTERIA opens up. Take, for
example, 9. typical college student-—Hunrath Sigafoos (son,
incidentally, of the Marlboro sales manager). Hunrath, a bright
lad, is currently majoring in burley at the University of Ken-
tucky. Under thc BACTERIA plan, Hunrath could stay at
Kentucky, where he has made many friends, but at the same
time broaden his vistas by taking a course in constitutional law
at Harvard, 9. course in physics at Caltech, a course in frostbite
at Minnesota and a. course in poi at Hawaii!

I admit there are still a. few bugs in BACTERIA. How, for
instance, could Hunrath attend a 9 o’clock class at Harvard,
9. 10 o’clock class at Hawaii, an 11 o’clock class at Minnesota, ‘
and still keep his lunch date at Kentucky? It would be idle to
deny that this is a tricky problem, but I have no doubt American
ingenuity will carry the day. Always remember how they
laughed at Edison‘ and Fulton--and particularly at Walter
Clavicle who invented the collarbone.

t o u 0 ma Mu simimn
Three cheers for American ingenuity, which gave us the
ACP, the collarbone and MGM . . . that's the Mighty Good
Makin’s you get in Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the un-
ﬁltered taste. Settle back and enjoy one. ‘You get a lot to like.
