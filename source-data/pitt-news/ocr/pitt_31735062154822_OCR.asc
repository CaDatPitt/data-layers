Students may have a radically
diﬁerent type of curriculum in
September, 1960.

A systematic revision of the
program of study is now under
way. Although there is no direct
relationship between this change
and trimesters, Dr. Albert Mar-
tin, associate dean of the School
of Liberal Arts, believes that the
institution of triterms has “tﬁ’g-
gered” action on the curriculum.

Some aspects of the program
are, however, influenced by the
trimester concept. The implemen-
tation of many one-term, three
credit, non-sequential courses will
in all probability be a part of the
program.

A tentative plan for a revised
curriculum‘ in Liberal Arts has
been submitted to the department
by Dr. Martin for discussion by

./_—

faculty members. The associate
dean expressed the view that this
plan. “will facilitate greatly the
problem of adjusting to tri-
terms.” ‘
Since in the past the students’
freedom to choose any course has
often worked to his disadvantage,
a new feature of the curriculum
will be more- required courses.
For Freshmen, it may be pos-
sible to substitute mathematics
for the present foreign language
requirement. Also, a student who

exempts English 1, 2 and 3, 4 _

neednot take any further written
expression cours e s. Presently,
these students are required to
take English 17, 18. ‘

Rather than having the present
requirement of 18 credits each in
Humanities, Social Studies and
Natural Sciences, liberal arts stu-
dents  have a more speciﬁc

program.

For example, in the Humanities,
students will be required to choose
ﬁve general courses from three
areas: literature; music or ﬁne
arts; and philosophy or religion.

I 0f SchoolCurriculum for 1960 V

(Continued from Page 1)
A course in integrated humanities
will be "available to upperclass-
men only. '
These general courses will not

I be surveys but will be’ courses

in which material on the partic-'-
ular subject has been carefully
selected from the area. ‘

Similar programs have been
provided in the Social Sciences
and Natural Sciences. Dr. Martin
stressed that this will not result
in a reduction of the varied na-‘
t_u-re of a person’s education but
will provide a richer educational
experience. ‘a

A unique feature of the pro-
posed program is the requirement
of "a course in a non—western cul-
ture—either Far Eastern Moslem,
Russian-Slavic, or African. '

Some of the new courses open

to upperclassmen would be the

 
 

history of science and the philo-
sophy of science, which are multi-
disciplinary in character, but will

-be oﬁered in the Natural Sciences,

if the program is approved.

In formulation of ‘a major, a
student would select two pre—re-
quisite courses in his sophomore
year.'These might allow him to
make a more rational selection of
a major. A student wouldbe re-
quired to take four to six_ basic
courses in the major area as an
upperclassman.

These would be “in fundamental
sub-areas of the discipline.” This
would eliminate the student’s
specializing in one particular area
of his major before he has be-
come acquainted With the entire
ﬁeld in which he is majoring.

In conjunction with the basic
courses the student might choose
two to four courses in specialized
areas of the major. ‘ "

I found time to attend. The historian may be expected to pre-

in formal procession, in academic attire, together, and per-
haps while doing so, to become better acquainted with one
 another. ‘

number of unemployed in the Pittsburgh area com-
peting for the relatively unskilled jobs ordinarily.
open to students. An added complication is the
impending steel strike, the uncertainty of which is
making employers, hesitant in hiring summer help.
Use Individual Initative

The studentsmust realize, then, that though the
Employment Agency is doing an excellent job, it
faces enormous difﬁculties; and unless they use

some initiative of their own, many may be without

employment altogether. -

The service already has 1,200 students to place
for summer work, with 50 or 60 more applying
daily. Even in normal circumstances it would be
most difficult for Mrs. Poole to place this number

possibility of availing themselves of it. Conseque
ly, Mrs. Poole’s job is an exhausting one.

In spite of difﬁculties, this year‘ she has suc-_
ceeded in placing approximately 1,300 students in
part-time jobs. In addition to this, she organized
this year the student stenographic service, employ-
ing at various‘ times 66 girls grossing approxi-

66, Girls — $66,000

This service is now- run by students with Mrs.
Poole in an advisory capacity. Besides being an
aid to the students, such accomplishments are an

advantage to the University.

For example, the 66 girls in the stenographic
service represent approximately» $66,000 to the Uni-
\versity, which it might not receive were the girls
not able to continue in school because of lack of

employment.

These problems are the ordinary ones faced by
the service. On top of these the agency has had to

Letters to the Editor

Bellow Critics An
Artist’s Place‘ Should
Be Rare, Respected

Editor, The Pitt News:

I,shall try to make an intelli-

gent reply to a great deal of
very unintelligent and. excited
criticism. It would seem" that
most everyone, save a few, were
appalled by my criticism of Saul
.Bel_low’s moment on the podium.

Everyone was appalled, excited-

and embarrassed and since then
has continued to criticize my re-
marks on that level, -never once
seeming to guess- that what was
said was very important both in
the particular nature, and in the
general nature. I
There are far too many heroes
and hero worship among certain
groups toward art and artists.
One of these groups is students;
other, that post-student

live and talk-in a World of lit-
erary names and literary critic-
isms (all of which are of a
stereotyped sort) hoping to catch
a little of that glory which is
obtained by a person once he is
named “artist.” '

This reverence, this 'ultra-re-

spect, this adulation, this lion- —

izing of a man simply because
he has written a few novels is
and despicably wrong,

serve it as a man, aspa being, as
"an individual, and judged upon
merits of thought, conviction,
commitment and the tenets of
art. . . -

In every society, the individ-
.ual of ‘creative geniusfis its guid-
ance and its salvation. It is he
to whom others turn for direc-
.tion, -for direction in our state,
our science, ourart.’

The position of artist should
be a select, unique position, and
can be ‘kept so only so long as
those men who assume those
positions are deserving upon the
most stringent of human merits,
and tearing down those unde-
serving who get\there by other
means, such as a vast social
program of book publication de-
signed to make money by mak-_
*ing r“arti‘sts,” artists ‘who ‘d ‘I

of people before summer. As it is the situation is
well’ nigh impossible. ‘ ‘
The important thing tor students to do is not
depend exclusively on the agency to ﬁnd them jobs.
Mrs. Poole has suggested that they contact small
stores, gas stations, etc. in their own localities‘ be-
sides the larger department ‘stores Downtown. An-.
. other suggestion is that the students register with
the Pennsylvania State Employment Agency.
Itis also vital that students make these efforts

now! As the time of the steel strike approaches, the
fewer people employers will be hiring. As it is,

lead us in thought or passion,
and do not deserve the respect
and attention due the great art-
ists of any society.

But to return to the particular
instant ‘that aroused all this, no
man who is an artist, described
as a man who reckons that what
he thinks and feels is so intense,
and so important to him that it
must berproduced ‘in tangible
form, no man who is truly’ this
should everhave so little to say
when he can reach people act-
ually and not vicariously via his
books, that he should bore them
and irritate them by a total-lack
of interest or conviction, and
read 'monotonously and word

« 3 for word a, pre—written criticism

"of other artists and other works.
He should know enough,_ feel

enough as a man, as an artist, to.

come before us and communicate

some bit of what he is as Saul.

Bellow man and Saul Bellow
artist. And when he does not do
this, he should be criticized, and
criticized fully for failing that
profession and position of art
and artist which he represents.

A profession and position not

/

to be commonized_by those who .
do not ennoble it; men such as it

this should be weeded out by the

rare and respected place, to
which they can safely turn for
meaning, for resolution, and for
counsel. ‘ '

remarks of mine made following
Saul 'Bellow’s Writers’ Confer-
ence-address. I am sure the

should not be too hasty in turning down a job
which pays too little. After all, too little is better
than nothing at all. T -

_At any rate, it“ is most important that students
in some one of these ways supplement the Student
Agency’s work; only through strenuous effort is it
likely that even a majority of students needing
jobs will ﬁnd them. '

For this reason ‘students

svver Critcs

“beat” objections did not de-
serve flippant dismissal, since
they did bring up for considera-
tion the lack of systeinized
thought in Mr. Bellow’s paper;
(2) that Mr. Bellow did not
(from his own opening remarks)
presume to speak as a profes-
sional critic and therefore suff-
ered from unfair _c_omparison
with the afternoon speaker, I. A.
Richards; (3) that Mr. Bellow
had offered the institutional, and
of their nature unsystemized, in-
sights of an" artist; (4) that crit-
ics have always valued the in-
sights of insigniﬁcant artists;
(5') that, for one example, the
Spring issue of the “Yale Re-
view”-' adds further‘, evidence

that Mr-. Bellow is a signiﬁcant ~

artist. , '

The implication, obviously, is
that Mr. Bellow spoke as legiti-
mately within his context as Mr.
Richards within his own. My re-
marks, considered in a less emo-
tional situation, will be seen,
ironically, to have been designed‘
_to allay the very tensions which
evidently prevented an under-
standing consideration of those
remarks at the time. I ’

They meant to_ point out,"‘most . »'
unoriginally, the traditional_art- .
reasoned-intutitional ‘

i s t-critic,
dilferences of ‘approach that un-

°»derlay t-he apparent dispute.

The force of the observation
should have been to supply the
reasonable answer that even (or
especially) “beat” students de-
serve,‘ to restore Mr. Bellow’s
talk to its rightful placeby the
reconciling argument he had
done himself the injustice of not
advancing, and to imply the di-
mensions and balance of the
Conference itself in presenting
the approaches of both an im-
portant critic and a‘ signiﬁcant,
artist. . ~

not been with this‘ university.
And in any event, my views re-

Social Advantages

kHere Mean Less
 Study, Trio Says

 By DEBORAH WILLSON
“The governing bodies of
most colleges
made up of at least one third
students,” explained three
Peruvian student leaders who
visited here last week. The
boys stopped, in Pittsburgh as
part of a State Department spon-
sored program. .This is the ﬁrst
in this‘ program
have come to the University.
The visiting students were Ri-

-cardo Letts C-olemnares from La

Molina School of Agronomy;

“Robin Voudrak Steel of the Na- . ’
* tional University of Engineering;

and Alejaurdo Diaz Marin from
"the Catholic University ’Law

‘ I School. .

As these boys are the presidents
of the student federations of their
respective schools,. they were
chosen for,the two—month4 tour of
the United States sponsored by
the National Students Association.

Year. Round Schooling ‘
. The boys are currently between
semesters since South American

schools are run on ya yea_rly basis,

instead of nine months as are
ours. They are studying and com-
paring student government and
college administrations in this
country and their own.

While in Pittsburgh they
talked with students, were taken
to Carnival, and attended a_ de-
bate given by the William Pitt

' Debate Union at Mount Lebanon

High School.
They were also taken’ on a tour
of the city by Clarence Reed,

’ chairman of the Community De-

velopment Program.

" Pittsburgh Praised

Letts, especially impressed by
this tour said, “The planned re-
development is an ambitious pro-
gram,” he said. “Pittsburgh is im-
pressive for its energetic pro-

THREE student leaders from Peru visited the University recently

 
   

tates to compare the student gov-

ernments and ‘administrations of U. S. Universities and colleges and

those in their countries.

The boys were volubleon the
differences in the administra-.
tions of -American Colleges and
their own. “In Peru,” they ex-
plained, “the governing body of

_the colleges 5 made up of ‘at
least one-third students who
help handle the budget, faculty
salaries, hiring of‘ personnel, etc.
Also, there is no distinction’be-
tween faculty and administra-
tion, the faculty is the adminis-
tration.” A

The boys also explained that
there is a much more formal re-

lationship between faculty a n (1

students in Peru. _
Advantages Compared
‘They were impresse

American students’ social advan-

tages, having enjoyed especially
attending Carnival. Letts, again
spokesman for the group, said, “If

I had the social opportunities

American students do, I wouldn’t

study either!”

to a happy marriage: (A) the mates’
similarity in ages and backgrounds, or

Which of these two famous men would
you most prefer to be like: (A) King
Midas, or (B) Ludwig van Beethoven?

If neither party's candidatein an
election was satisfactory to you,
would you (A) not vote, or (B) vote
for the “lesser of two evils”?

If your performance in a-group effort‘-
was being unjustly criticized, would

V you (A) settle the score directly with
your critic, or (B) ignore it andlet
the group decide its merits‘;

also with .

He referred, of course", to the
boys’ impression -that U.S. stu-
dents are not as absorbed in na-
tional and scholastic problems

as are the Peruviaias. ' ‘ E

Letts again seemed to feel that
this ’is partially because “few
Peruvian schools have any dor-
mitories or campus, and there is
no such thing as fraternity life.’-’

Another aspect of U.S. college
life the boys thought different
was the manner of dress of the
students. “The South Americans
are more formal,” they explain-
ed,” and there are even vast dif-
ferences between your own uni-
versities. Pittsburgh is one of
the best we’ve seen in this re-
spect,” they added.

From Pitsburgh the three stu-
dents will go to Columbia Uni-
versity in New York and then
back to Penn State and some
other Eastern colleges.
