Alumni link disputes

law student’s claims

By Michael Ashford

and Michelle Zollner
The Pitt News

Dean Richard Pierce resigned from
his post at the law school last week
because of what he called a dispute with
the university administration, “overihe
administration’s lack of budget support
for the law school. ” Professor Richard
Seeburger said yesterday that Pierce
resigned because of “heightened and
clear frustration" over budget allo-
cation requests.

“I can state without a
doubt, ” he said, “that all
revenue raised from alum-
ni does. go to ﬁmd extra,
non-operating expenses
such as sending students to
moot—court competitions. ”

— Richard Brok
Administrative Liaison

Since then, the law school faculty
steering committee has met repeated-
ly with Pitt Provost Roger Benjamin to
discuss ﬁnancial disputes as they relate
to the dean’s resignation;

“We believe the administration is
taking this matter 99.9 percent serious-
ly,” said John Burkoff, steering com-
mittee chairman.

Law students are more skeptical
about how the ﬁnancial problems are
being handled. They have seen two
deans resign for the same reasons
within two years; Pierce’s predecessor,
Dean Murray, quit over budget
disputes in 1983.

Ron Carnevali, president of the Stu-
dent Bar Association, has called ad-

ministration responses to the dean’s re-

‘quests “all words and no action.”

Carnevali, who represents the law
students at large through the Student
Bar Association also contends that
because of the administration’s poor
financial support for the school,
“money intended for such things as ex-
panding the library  is diverted to pay
for administrative costs.”

There is some confusion, however,
about what funds are going where.
Richard Brok, administrative liaison
between the university Office of
Development and the Ofﬁce for Alum-

ni Affairs, said “the money which-

[Carnevali] refers to as being ‘diverted’
doesn’t exist.”

Brok expressed his concern over
Carnevali’s statements, fearing that
they could mislead and alarm law
school alumni contributors. “I can state
without a doubt,” he said, “that all

revenue raised from alurrmi does go to ‘

fund extra, non-operating expenses
such as sending students to moot-court
competitions. ”

Nevertheless, many questions appear
unresolved. Carnevali defended his
statements, saying, “My facts were
from, as I consider, a very trustwor-
thy source.” He added, “It was never
my intention to discourage the alumni
from contributing to the school because
at no time in the school’s history has
such giving been so important.”

The law school faculty and faculty
steering committee will be meeting
with Provost Benjamin again on Fri-
day and next week to futher discuss the
budget dispute and general administra-
tion policies.

In reference to Associate Provost
Ahlbrath’s remarks about Pierce’s
resignation, Carnevali commented:
“Ultimately, the point the student body
is trying to make is that Dean Pierce’s
actions were not ridiculous, but
justified by the university’s reticence
to adequately fund the law school.”

UPI — Do you suppose that a
minority child raised in poverty
could give the deﬁnition of a
pirouette?

The national center for fair and
open testing, called Fairtest, says
that that child probably could not.
Fairtest is a new organization alleg-
ing bias in standardized tests. It
hopes for changes to make tests
fairer for minorities and other peo-
ple not born into mainly white
upper—middle-class America.

According to Fairtest, a pirouette
—- a ballet twirl — is an example
of a word on a test that’s skewed
in favor of upper—middle-class-
American kids.

The Scholastic Aptitude Test,
taken each year by more than one
million college-bound students, is
the most commonly known stan:
dardized test, but some nine million
other Americans also take stan-

Fairtest group
seeks fair testing

dardized tests each year to be
licensed in more than 50 ﬁelds —
from hair dressing to welding — or
to get into graduate schools.

Fairtest argues that if test items
are culturally biased, then many
people who take standardized tests
have the cards stacked against
them.

Fairtest cites ‘ ‘pirouette” as one
example of SAT questions which
discriminate against students who
are not familiar with the activities
and vocabulary of upper-middle.-
class America. It argues that such
items are not fair to test-takers who
do not ﬁt that mold.

Fairtest says other words which
would be alien to most poor or
minority test-takers, but which ap-
pear in standardized tests, include
“sonata,” “minuet,” “melo-
deon,” “bridle” and “heirloom.”

The Pitt News

Balloons, T-shirts, popcorn, drinks
and displays all added to the general
feeling of well-being yesterday as the
University of Pittsburgh celebrated the
second annual Festival of Health.
Sponsored by the Student Health Ser-
vice, the festival promoted health care
with music, dancing and fun instead of

- lectures and books. ~

“We wanted to inform the students
of the importance of lifestyle in pro-
moting good health habits and to
heighten the students’ awareness of the
impact that present health may have on
future health,” stated Shirley Haber-

man, coordinator of the Festival of.

Rival SGB

This Saturday’s football game be-
tween the Pitt Panthers and the Nittany
Lions has attracted a lot of attention
from bookmakers and potential betters.
The latest line shows Penn State a six-
and-one-half-point favorite over the
Panthers. _

Some bets over the game, however,
involve more than just mere money.
Student Government Board President
Luke Kluchko has made a bet with
Penn St_ate’s SGB President Dave
Rosenblatt — a bet that is not to be

cure, most displays informed students
of the importance of good nutrition,
proper hygiene and excercise.

“Health means more than the
absence of disease — it is the social,
physical and mental well-being of a
person,” said Haberrnan.

The Festival of Health addressed
issues -‘of major concern to college
students, such as stress management,
date rape, eating disorders, substance
abuse, and sexually transmitted
diseases. Students could obtain
literature, ask questions and hear
speakers address these issues.

Most of the displays offered students
tangible items which could be used to
promote health care. For example, free
tubes of toothpaste, small bottles of
Robitussin cough medicine, Co-
Tylenol, pamphlets and food were
distributed. Other displays offered
evaluations of height, weight, percent

Gillis, physical education instructor,
said she felt there was a need for an
event such as the Festival of Health.

“A lot of kids are from out of town, _ .' ‘

and this festival gives them an idea of
the resources available to them,” said
Gillis.

Health said they hoped every student
would ﬁnd something of interest at the
fair. It appeared that therewas indeed
something for everyone. “Student
response has been great,” claimed
Debbie Roberts of the Student Health
Advisory Board. “People have been in
and out all day.”

The students who attended the

Festival of Health appeared very recep- _ A

tive to the information available to
them. “It’s neat,” said Brecter Rucker,
a graduate student. “The visual
displays were very informati_ve.’~’

presidents place bets

taken too lightly.

“It’s a very simple bet,” said
Kluchko. “If PSU wins, I have to treat
him to one of Pitt’s finest delicacies,
one of Prirnanti Brothers’ famous sand-
wiches. I also have to wear a ‘Penn
State No. 1’ T-shirt, although for how
long is still under negotiation.

‘ ‘If Pitt wins, though,’ ’ he continued,
“he has to treat me to a Penn State
delicacy — sticky buns — and he has
to wear a Pitt T-shirt around the Penn
State campus - a much more
dangerous undertaking.”

The agreement has been a long time
in the making. “We’ve been talking
about it for a while,” said Kluchko. “I

invited him [Rosenblatt] here to the Pitt
game, and we both thought that since
we are student leaders at our respec-
tive universities, we should make a bet
beﬁtting our position.”

Rosenblatt was unavailable for com-
ment about the bet, but Kluchko admit-

ted he would be very disappointed if '_

the Panthers should lose to the
undefeated Nittany Lions. “If we lose,
I’ll feel like everyone else does when
we lose to Penn State,” said Kluchko.
“I’ll feel lousy.”

If the Panthers win, will Kluchko
gloat? “I haven’t decided what I’ll do
yet,” he said, “but I probably will do,
my share of the gloating.”

GENEVA — Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev and President Reagan met
for one hour and 15 minutes in the sec-

No infomiation regarding the talks has
been released to the press due to the

blackout is to remain in effect until the
end of the ﬁrst superpower summit held
in six years.

During his lunch break, Gorbachev

met with civil-rights activist Rev. Jesse '

Jackson. Jackson presented a petition

BEIRUT, Lebanon — British

Beirut to discuss the release of four

Waite has also added four Frenchmen
to his list of hostages to be released.
Waite called on the Moslem extremists
to release the hostages because the eyes

burgh. Editorial opinions are made by a majority of the

of the author and not of The Pitt News staff.

Poland’s Gamble

In Poland, the government has recently made
changes that suggest it presumes the political
emergency that instigated the imposition of martial
law to be over. The new appointments to Parliament’s
Council of Ministers were largely dominated by
economists. This, in combination with recent releases
of political prisoners, represents evidence that
establishing order is no longer of primary concern,
and that the shift of policy emphasis is toward resolv- .
ing Poland’s grave economic outlook.

Watchful experts believe that the Council’s new
technocrats are eager to undertake reforms similar to

those which launched Hungary’s program of ‘ ‘goulash «

communism,” under which Hungary’s centrally
planned economy has been infused with elements of
capitalism as a spur to increased production. In-
terestingly, Moscow, anxious to be rid of an ener-
vating economic burden that it can ill—afford in light
of. its own economic woes, seems to be in support
of economic reform in Poland.

The people of Poland have heard promises before,
however, and they have good reason to be skeptical.
And, even should the government develop an
economic program capable of stimulating growth,
they may still have difﬁculty implementing it. The
Polish people have little trust in what they see as op-
pressive, inept political leadership, and it might be
too much to expect them to make the kinds of
sacriﬁces which are demanded by programs of
economic reform, especially without the participation
of Solidarity in the decision-making process.

Economic reform is often a risky undertaking. In
Poland’s case, however, it has become a necessity.
In Poland, economic crises have historically led to
political turmoil. In order to ensure future political
stability, the government must gamble and take steps
which might, in the long run, stimulate economic
growth and production and, thereby, serve to meet
the demands of the Polish consumers. The dangers
are self—evident, but the dangers of ignoring increas-

ing demands for_“butter” by the Polish people are

even greater.

Reactions To

Farrakhan

Our reaction to Rev. Farrakhan’s
speech on Thursday night is one of
moral outrage due to the anti-Jewish,
anti-Christian, and racist remarks con-
tained in it. It should be obvious to
anyone who listened to Farrakhan that
attacks toward Jews and others were
unquestionably present. And those who
deny such attacks are merely fooled by
his rhetoric.

It is highly unfortunate that those
who are knowledgeable on the substan-
tive issues that Louis Farrakhan abuses
in his message of hatred have not yet
sooken out. We agree with the high
ideal that Farrakhan expressed regard-
ing himself the epitome of the deceit-
ful and skilled liar.

The Pitt/Hillel Club

As a black student here at the
University of Pittsburgh, I feel that it
is necessary to reﬂect on the Re-
flections on Farrakhan Forum. The
question is, was this really a reﬂection
on Farrakhan’s speech or a Farrakhan
debate, pro or con?

The panel was predominately white
and obviously anti-Farrakhan. It seems
as though there has been tension here
among the black and Jewish students
ever since the Black Action Society ex-
tended an invitation to the Minister Far-
rakhan to speak during their annual
Black Week.

This tension was very obvious dur-
ing the forum. Avery Abrams, a Jewish
student and obviously anti-Farrakhan,
said that although he wasn't at the Far-
rakhan lecture, he still believed that
Farrakhan was anti-Semitic. Two other
members of the panel who also were
not present at the lecture accused Far-
rakhan of being anti-Semitic.

Minister Louis Farrakhan justified
his statements against the Jewish peo-
ple during the Thursday night speech.
What more can Farrakhanado? It still
is not enough to please everyone. As
Lloyd Bond stated during the forum,
just because one criticizes a Jewish per-
son doesn’t mean he is anti-Semitic,
nor is he anti-black if he criticizes a
black person.

If Minister Farrakhan is anti-Sernitic,
then we all should be accused as being

anti—something at some point in our

lives. Why do we always have to find

fault when we have a black leader?
Name Withheld Upon Request

I, for one, wish to go on record and
express my views of the Minister Far-
rakhan’s lecture of Thursday evening,
Nov. 14, 1985.

The Black Action Society of the
University of Pittsburgh is to be con-
gratulated. Mr. Farrakhan’s lecture
was enlightening, factual, excellently
presented and controlled. Mr. Far-
rakhan’s stance and composure in light
of all the negative, unwarranted con-
troversy were deﬁnitely a plus in his
favor. There was never any hint of bit-
ter hatred.

I knew from the very beginning that

‘the dissatisfaction of whites with Far-

rakhan was based on the fact that a
black man has the guts to speak up
without waiting for a white head to nod
and say it‘s OK.

Mr. Farrakhan and the BAS, your
performance was quite impressive.
And to Minister Farrakhan, please
don’t make this your last visit to
Pittsburgh.

Wrong Emphasis

The article on Congressman Walter
Fauntroy’s recent lecture on Monday,
Nov. 1 1, 1985, suggested that tax
breaks are the main problem in
America today.

I respectfully submit that his mention
of tax breaks was only to illustrate the
inequities of the tax system. For Con-
gressman Fauntroy, the main problem
in America today is the re-direction of
the ﬂow of capital of this country into
nations that will allow American
businesses within them. These are
usually Third World countries. Thus,
the American market imports foreign
products such as cars, shoes and radios
and sells them at a cost much less than
[the cost to] be made in.America.

Plan A Head

Kelly Shaffer’s article on holiday
traveling (Nov. 13) was informative,
well-written and clearly beneficial for
readers of The Pitt News, but it was
disappointing to note your use of the
redundancy “planning ahead” in the
story’s title.

There is no way that one can possibly
plan other than ahead. One does not
plan retrospectively. backward or
sideways — only ahead, for the future.
It is therefore, unnecessary and redun-
dant to “plan ahead.” One just plans,

A period, the implication being that one

plans for a future event, program or
activity.

The only situation where it is correct
to “plan ahead” is when naval ar-
chitects or engineers are engaged in
designing ships’ toilets (Nautically
speaking, a toilet is referred to as a
head.)

I no longer smoke. I use almost no
salt. I haven’t had an egg in years, and

I don’t hardly drink booze no more. I
__run in the mornings, sometimes work

\‘_~=‘».' t in the afternoon and won’t sit in the

vi‘

dangerous summer sun even though it
makes me look healthy and handsome.
I am, I swear, nearly perfect, but God
— are you listening, God? — I need my
coffee.

Coffee is all I have left. I start the
morning with it. I make some when I

get to work, and Idrink it all day _

through. I have coffee after lunch and
sometimes before dinner and always
after it. I can drink it iced, but prefer
it hot and have never met a cup I didn’t
like. For years a meal, no matter how
y-rpod, was nothing but a prelude to the
"coffee and cigarette to follow. Those
were the days.
Now comes the usual bunch of scien-
tists, this time from the Johns Hopkins
Medical School, to rain on what’s left

retclﬁﬁ,

 

of my parade. As I always knew they
would, they have found a link between
coffee and heart disease. They say that
a person who drinks five or more cups
a day is almost three times as likely to
develop heart problems as a person
who drinks no coffee at all. This find-
ing is based on a 38-year study of
physicians.

For the moment, the study’sf1ndings
are called “tentative.” This was em-
phasized by the wonderful Dr. Chailes

Hennekens who, by his very words, of- ‘
fered me all the excuses I need to con- -

tinue drinking coffee. My hat is off to
the sensational Dr. Lynn Rosenberg.
an epidemiologist at the Boston Univer-
sity School of Medicine, who says her
own studies have established no link to
heart attacks. They ought to name a
coffee after her — Blue Mountain
Rosenberg.

Alas and alack. I know deep down
it is no good. This is the way it was

with cigarettes. First, there was just a
folk belief that it was bad for you, then
rumors of scientiﬁc studies and then,
catastrophically. the surgeon general’s
report. Goodbye ciggies.

The same will happen with coffee.
It is probably just a matter of time un-
til we coffee drinkers are segregated in
restaurants, admonished at dinner par-
ties when we askvfor a cup and held’
responsible for the forced landing of
airplanes at Heathrow just because we
had a cup of coffee in the no-coffee sec-
tion. From this to socialized medicine
is but a short step. I

I think I got hooked on coffee
because my parents would not let me
drink it. Since then. I have associated
it with rebellion and creativity and, of
course, leftist politics which is a syn-
thesis of the two. (Tea, on the other
hand. is associated with imperialism
and. thus. exploitation.)

When I got older and wanted to
write, I went to coffeehouses in Green-
wich Village where I drank sweet cap-
puccino with nutmeg sprinkled on top
and smoked bitter. industrial strength
Gauloise cigarettes — a kind of mixed
metaphor of European affections. In
this way. I declared myself a writer
although I did no writing and, instead,
in the mornings went off to ajob with
an insurance company.

The cigarettes are long gone. There
is only the coffee. I begin the day by
drinking it and end the day preparing
to drink it in the morning. I have an
electric coffee maker with a timer. I set
it at night. and in the morning it
automatically grinds the beans and
makes the coffee. The very sound of
it grinding all on its own is sweeter to
me than the morning birds. and the
aroma of fresh-brewed coffee wafting
up the stairs is what beckons me from
bed.

The years have taken their toll. I no
longer have cream. I no longer have
sugar, and I have switched at night to
decaffeinated — as long as it is brewed.
One by one my aging friends have
abandoned coffee, complained about
the shakes or nervousness, sometimes
holding up their hands if a second cup
is offered, recounting how they just
can’t drink the stuff anymore. Not me.
I drink all I want, whenever I want, and
about the only time coffee affects me
emotionally is when I’can’t get it after
a meal.

So, please, Johns Hopkins research-
ers, check your data. Go over your
figures. Coffee starts my heart in the
morning. gets me through the day and
is the drink that I would miss the most.
Think about the harm you’ll do to peo-
ple like me if you positively prove a
link between coffee and heart disease.

We’ll go back to smoking.

She filled her glass from the bottle,
took a sip and leaned back sigliijng.
“That doesn’t help,” she said. “I’m
not just trying to cope.”

The rain was running thick down the
side of the street. He could see leaves
and sticks swirling in a pool at the cor-
ner, before they disappeared down the
drain. -

She stiffened her shoulders. Her
knuckles turned white around the glass,
eyes fixed upon but not seeing its dark.
red content.

“You heard them last night,” she
said softly. “I can’t believe some of the
things they were saying.”

She.looked quickly over at him and
away again. “You were awfully
quiet,” she said.

“Yeah,” he said. “I know.” His
eyes were following the drops sliding
down the pane now. ' _

“Well,” she said, “why didn’t you
say something?”

He turned around abruptly, raising
his hands palms up and squashing his
head down between his shoulders.
“What’s wrong? It was a sensitive
issue and I didn’t want to make it any
worse, OK?”

He looked at her for a moment
before turning back to the window.

She sighed again and took another sip
from the glass. “I know,” she said.
“But we both know they were way out
of line  and they weren’t even sure
of what they were saying.”

Inhaling deeply, he went to the table,
picked up his glass and returned to the

window, exhaling as his gaze once
again fell on the wet scene outside.
“They were saying a lot of things,”
he said. “And I couldn’t keep track of
it all.”

“Like I said, if you were gonna be
able to deal with all that information,
you’d have to have a photographic
memory,” he said.‘ '

She was still staring into her glass.
“Well, I know what I want to say,”
she said. “I just don’t know who to say
it to.” Her arms dropped loosely into
her lap, almost spilling the wine. She
gazed blankly at the table.

The rain was letting up a little now
and he went back to the table and sat
down. “It won’t make any difference
anyway,” he said.

He watched her, waiting for her to
look into his eyes. A

She stood and crossed the room to
stand by the window.

“I mean, I have something to say."
she said.

The rain had stopped.

He filled his glass, and took a sip,
leaning on the table. He let his head
drop down between his arms.

“So what are you going to do?“ he
said.

She looked up at the shifting clouds.
.“I don’t know,” she said.

The clouds broke for an instant,
ﬂashing the blue above before it was
covered again.

“Hey, I think it‘s gonna clear up."
she said.

He rose listlessly, crossing the room

to stand beside her at the window. The '

scene was brighter. and the flow of
water had slowed. He could see the
drain now, clogged with leaves and
sticks.

“If only I knew who to say it to,”

she said. Her eyes fell to stare into the

street. now focusing on anything.

He looked up at the sky. The clouds
broke suddenly apart, exposing the
vivid blue above in a broadening ex-
panse. “It is clearing up,” he said.

She looked up just as the sun ap-
peared, blinding them both with its
unexpected brilliance.

“Wow,” he said, squinting and rais-
ing his hand to shield his eyes, then
looking back down to the street.

She continued squinting up at the
sun. _

“Look at that." he said, tapping the
pane to get her attention. In the spar-
kling scene before them, glistening
drops fell from the trees, and the leaves
had become a glowing orange.

“Wow,“ she said, still squinting as
her face turned down to see.

“Hey. I’ve got it!” she said, a broad
smile breaking across her face. “I’ll
write a column for The Pitt News!"

IF C elects

By Michelle M. Zollner
Staff Writer

Last night, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil held its annual elections for its
board.

The newly—elected president, Nasos
George, from Zeta Beta Tau fratemi-

ty, said, “Co’ntrary,t,0-the ‘Animal .

House’ image thatlsome misinformed
propagandists have tried to paint us [the
fraternities] with, the involvement is
ﬁve percent alcohol and 95 percent
human relations. Misinformation is the
fraternities’ biggest enemy, and I’ll

new executive board

ﬁght it any way I can!”

Each candidate, in order to be
nominated, must be in good standing
with the IFC, have achieved at least a
2.25 quality point average and have
completed at least 12 credits.

Jeff Maffe, the new internal vice
president, said he feels the three main
objectives he has to deal with are rush,
socialactivities and sports, and that he
believes that his responsibility is to do
the-best that he can.

Secretary Mike King said his goals
are to improve the fraternity rush. At
the beginning of the year, 900 rush
cards were sold, and only 22 percent

of those holding cards became pledges.
John Waterbar, a brother in the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house, said, “I am look-
ing for a system to get a better percen-
tage of people rushing to the number
of cards sold.”

People in attendance voiced approval
of the newly elected board. As Chris
Dancu, a senior at Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity said, “I’m very pleased with
the new board. There is good represen-
tation of the smalland large houses.”

One upcoming objective of the
Greeks is to “promote the Greek
system more,” according to Steve
Zumoff.

Fraternity denies hazing allegations

_By Dan Bates

News Editor

The president of the Omega Psi Phi
fraternity has denied all allegations of
a hazing incident which reportedly
resulted in the injuries of two fraterni-
ty pledges. .

“All allegations are false,” said Der-
rick Solomon, the fratemity’s presi-
dent. “We do not haze at all.”

The pledges, Pitt sophomore Joel
Christian and Duquesne University stu-
dent Kevin Jenkins, were allegedly
smacked on their heads by fraternity
members during a ritual for pledges.
Christian suffered a ruptured eardrum,
and Jenkins suffered a fractured jaw.

The universitv administration

 

suspended the fraternity pending a
hearing, which was held on Monday,
Nov. 11. However, Student Activities
Director Andrew Smith, who con-
ducted the hearing along with Greek
adviser Bridget Guernsey, would not
disclose the outcome of the hearing. '
Solomon said he has not yet received
a decision from the administration, but
he said the fraternity was not treated
fairly in the “due process” hearing.

' “Everything was biased before we

even walked in the door [to the hear-
ing]," Solomon said.

He also claims that the fraternity did
not even know about the hazing allega-
tions until The Pitt News reported it in
the Nov. 8 edition. “This disturbed a.
lot of members," he said.

In another development, an ' in-
vestigative report was ﬁled at Pitt’s
Public Safety Department against three
individuals who were allegedly in-
volved in the hazing incident, accord-
ing to Sgt. Francis Walsh, the police
officer who ﬁled the report. However,
he would not release any names, ap-
parently due to protection granted to
students ‘under the Buckley Amend-
ment.

A complaint was also reportedly ﬁled
at the local magistrate’s ofﬁce by one
of the injured students against the
fraternity, but, according ‘to an uniden-
tiﬁed spokesperson, the local district
attorney turned it downuntil more in-
formation could be obtained about the
alleged hazing. —

Dentistry prof dies

Dr. James M. McNerney, a professor of dentistry in the Cleft Palate
Center of the University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry, died at the
age of 82 of congestive heart failure last Saturday in St. Clair Memorial
Hospital, according to Monday’s Pittsburgh Press.

Dr. McNerney, who lived in Crafton, specialized in the study and treat-
ment of cleft palates. He was a 1925 graduate of the Pitt School of Dental
Medicine and did graduate work in general anesthesia and oral surgery
at Washington University in St. Louis, the article stated.

Dr. McNerney taught‘ at Allegheny General Hospital School of Nurs-
ing, where he was chief of the dental department in 1940 and 1941. He
also served on the staff of West Penn Hospital. Dr. McNerney retired
from his downtown practice last January.

Dr. McNemey received the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the
University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in 1979. He was a
member of Psi Omega fraternity, Chartiers Country Club and St. Philip’s

He is survived by his wife Agnes Gordon McNemey; a son, Dr. James

National Education Assoc.
praises teaching profession

A new education report calling for
a ﬁve-part plan to strengthen the na-
tion’s teaching profession was praised
recently by the National Education
Association as a realisticand practical
approach to giving teaching the status
it richly deserves. .

The report, by The Carnegie Foun-
dation for the Advancement of
Teaching, notes the education reform
movement “will accomplish little”
unless teachers are given “greater
status and recognition." .

 

 

“The Carnegie report is a thoughtful
reﬂection of what's required to achieve
excellence in education,” said NEA
president Mary I-Iatwood Futrell.
“Public school policymakers should
heed the Carnegie recommendations
and take swift action to make these
creative and innovative proposals a:

reality. ’ ’ I- -‘

The new Carnegie data report, “The
Condition of Teaching: A State by State
Analysis, 1985.7’ calls for urgent ac-
tion on the five-point plan including:

0A national program to attract
outstanding young people into
teaching.

0A tightening of professional stan-
dards for teachers.

‘Greater recognition and reward for
teachers.
Olmproved salaries for teachers.

0A provision for continuing educa-

tion as a part of every teacher’s
contract.

I

Ernest L. Boyer, president of thg 

Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-'
ment of Teaching, said a ‘ ‘national pro-

gram of teacher recruitment is re-

quired” in noting that more than 1.5

million elementary and more than one-

half million secondary teachers will be

needed by 1993.

Boyer called on Congress to fund
scholarship programs to encourage
gifted students to take up teaching. He
also asked colleges and universities to
drop their “hostility toward teaching
in public schools” and offer scholar-
ships to outstanding students who plan
to teach.

“Recruiting future teachers is at least
as important as recruiting fullbacks,”
said Boyer.

In calling for a dramatic overhaul of .

teacher education, Boyer said teacher
candidates must be more carefully

selected and apprentice teachers must -'

spend more time learning from out-
standing practicing teachers.

Boyer suggested that each state

establish a Board of -Teacher Licensure,
with a majority comprised of senior
‘classroom teachers. The board would
require teacher candidates to pass a
written examination in English profi-
ciency and subject matter competence
before being credentialed.

Boyer also listed three kinds. of.
rewards for teachers: psychic, extrin-
sic and ancillary. Psychic rewards, he
explained, come -from such‘ things as

reaching students and helping them‘;-_

learn; extrinsic rewards from more
pay, status and prestige; and ancillary

rewards include security, having spare‘ _ .

time and convenient schedules.
Noting that salaries have improvai

, in recent years, Boyer noted that “we . H
 still -have states A where beginning '
it j salaries are disgraceful, - and the '
annual average, for all salaries is "less
» than $18,000. The national average

iS $23,545. ‘Boyer has proposed a
25-percent increase over three years for
beginning teachers.
Boyer charged that the continuing
education of teachers has been con-

sistently neglected and called for “an¢._,

arnihcntic program of continuing educa-
tion so that all teachers can be intellec-
tually enriched.“

The report was written by C. Emilyh
Fcistritzcr. who heads the National
Center for Education Information.

MYth.-.b€90H1€Sf631itY

By Marilyn McNeal
» For The Pitt News

Two girls are lounging on the
pullout bed and one is sitting at the
‘desk. Everyone is quiet. There is
tension and embarrassment. Sud-
denly, one girl begins to speak. The
other girls listen. They watch as she
plays with a pencil. They know
how she feels. They understand.

The speaker is Joan, a Pitt
sophomore. She is relating an ex-
perience that is neither new nor un-
common — date rape. Six days
ago, her date made aggressive at-
tempts to force her into sexual rela-
tions with him. “She dicljn’§t,..tell
anyone, but she is "speal<i4ri,g‘.-;.._ti;p

Statistics show.tl;_at&,sucli,_fg§c,eégl
attempts at sexual_'i’n}_itna,cy rarerpgt
isolated occurrence_s.:.,They a;:e,an
established reality on college cam-
puses across the United States. A
basic lack of understanding be-
tween young men and women lays
the foundation for many miscon-
ceptions that perpetuate forced at-
tempts at sexual intercourse. In ex-
treme cases, rape is committed.

In a study published in 1982, Dr.
Mary Koss, a psychology professor
at Kent State University, examined
the sexual encounters of average
college students. Out of 3,862‘
university students, she found that
70.5 percent of the female students
had been in situations where a date
had misunderstood the level of sex-
ual relations they were prepared to
handle.

This was the case with Joan. “I '
was saying ‘Leave!’ but he
wouldn’t go. He kept making ad-
vances. It was freaky. He acted like
‘you know you want me.’ We were
on two different levels.”

It is clear that Joan and her date
began the evening with two very
different ideas about each other. “I
thought he was nice, you know, so
we went out. Then he started
pushing it  he had something in
mind.”

In many dating situations this gap
of understanding often leads to
trouble. Anne Hayes, of Pittsburgh



Action Against Rape spoke yester- .
day at Pitt on the issue of date rape.
She explains, “The root of the pro-
blem is attitude. Too many people
generalize their fellow students as
nice people who’ve made all the
right decisions. They don’t realize
that the perfectly nice person they
meet may be an insecure, selfish
person who will not respect their
rights. The mixed communications
that surround their date may lead
to a date rape situation.”

This lack of understanding and
consideration each person may
carry into the date can be further
aggravated by the superﬁcial nature

=91".   ‘.'i,!'....5  “.-J‘  '.  §_
: . .  “£771.34-I00tI.*0f€’,l;€3 problem  .



Joan’s account of her ordeal
highlights this particular motiva-
tion. “He was defending his macho
image so that he wouldn’t have to
say, ‘Oh, I was turned down by a
girl.’ ”

On the other hand, the shaky
communication between acquain-
tances on a date forces the girl to
handle a situation that she isn’t
prepared for. She is often unable to.
assert her feelings to establish a
ﬁrm, clear stance, and she has lit-
tle awareness that increased em-
phasis is placed on her appearance
and behavior; that the ﬂirtation she
may have used in high school is
now seen as a definite invitation.

of their acquaintance. Some male
students may feel that any girl they
don’t know is “fair game.” If she
doesn’t know him, but she is alone
with him, she must be “loose.”
Naturally, she’ll have sex with him,
he may begin the date with this
ultimate goal in mind, regardless of
his ideas about her reputation.

In a dating situation based on

casual acquaintance, some males
simply feel that they have no
obligation to respect their date’s
rights.

“I really don’t know how I met
him. I just kept seeing him in the
halls and stuff,” said Joan. Accord-
ing to Kathleen Peoples, a coun-
selor at the University Counseling
Center, many girls feel “seeing is

knowing.” They see some guy in
the cafeteria and in the laundry.
They get a sense that they know
him.

‘ ‘You don’t know people ... you
go out with them and they can be

“Many students have little ex-

They come from smaller, more
restricted settings and then they ar-
rive here.”

“Places like the Towers give
them a false‘ sense of security,”
says law student Bob, who wishes
not to be identiﬁed. “These kids
have just been uprooted. They’re

unusual for a girl to ﬁnd herself

Where do these misunderstand-
ings come from? Who is responsi-
ble? The misunderstandings that
lead to any rape take root in the
American social structure. In many
cases it is our institutions that rein-
force negative values, not eradicate
them. From the pre-school level on
up, educational systems in America
contribute to the prevalence of the
attitudes and behaviors that allow
one party the freedom to exert
physical and emotional pressure on
another party in attempts to obtain

ll?-lgolmstrom and Ann ’Wolbert
 Burgess, the author of “Rape and
Everyday Life,” social ideals con-
cerning “normal” heterosexual
relationships support the attitudes
that create the rape situation.

 

  

The boundiies separating sex and

violence are becoming more and
more unclear. Popular ﬁgures, such
as James Bond, do ‘nothing to
dispell standard myths. Holmstrom
and Burgess feel that there is a new
“coercive sexuality” that is becom-
ing an acceptable model of behavior
for males in our society. Rape is
now an extreme type of behavior
which society has designated as ac-
ceptable. Both males and females
suffer the consequences.

But what does this have to do
with education? Everything. It is
every school’s responsibility to see
that their students graduate with a
basic exposure to many ideas that
have contributed to our society.

the strengthening of the learning,

Adoption: The choice and coping of one college couple

Editor ’s Note: This article is the
third in a series of articles con-
cerning college pregnancy
decisions.

By' Evangeline D’Aquila
Staff Writer

Nikki Allen was a 19-year-old
sophomore at Pitt. Her boyfriend,
Michael Garret, was a" junior at near-
by Carnegie-Mellon University. She

sang in the choir and wrote for the ‘

newspaper. He played the cello, acted
as a part-time racquetball instructor and
was studying to be an ‘electrical
engineer. They had been dating for two
and a half years, “high school
sweethearts” from Baldwin, and were
more than content with their active
lives and each other.

Then Nikki disbelievingly
discovered that she was pregnant, but
instead of scheduling an abortion ap-
pointment as the clinic counselor sug-
gested, she and Michael opted for the
less common alternative of a full-term

pregnancy and adoption. For eleven
months, they literally put their lives on
hold as the homework, concerts, par-
ties and football games that once
dominated were replaced with
obsessive thoughts of the pregnancy
and adoption.

According to studies performed by
the Alan Guttmacher Institute, Nikki is
no different than 5.5 million other
teenage girls who ﬁnd themselves preg-
nant at least once out of wedlock.

_ “It’s funny,” said Nikki, “because I
as ignorant as it sounds, you always

think that -it could, never happen to
YOU-’’  . . .
Michael agreed: “I was so in love,
nothing mattered. Now I know that you
can’t just have fun and not expect to
pay some kind of consequences.”
But according to the Guttmacher
Study, Nikki and Michael deviated
greatly from the overwhelming majori-
ty of college students who choose
abortion under similar circumstances.
According to the studies, “college
women from affluent families almost
always relied on abortion since the
unplanned pregnancy is an obstacle in

the path of career plans.”

Nikki and Michael are ﬁctitious
names, although they are real people.
They are not naive or stupid, they just
do not believe in the concept behind
birth control. They did not make love
very often, and then only at the times
she thought were safe. Similar to birth
control, neither of them advocated
abortion, and they were strong enough
to hold onto their beliefs whenfaced
with their predicament. ' in

“I do not believe in abortion’ as a I‘

method of birth control, ” said Michael.
“I can condone it only in cases of rape
or where the mother’s life may be at
stake.” .

“Like Michael, once I decided that
abortion was not the answer, I knew
that I had made the correct‘ choice,”
said Nikki, ‘ ‘but we had no idea where
to procede from there. Emotionally and
financially, neither of us were prepared
to bring up a child.”

“Adoption clearly stood out as the
best solution for all, especially the
baby,” said Michael. “Once I reached
this conclusion, my decision IICVEF
wavered. I knew that emotionally,I

would not let myself get caught up in
the pregnancy.

“Nikki was definitely more caught
up in the pregnancy than I was,”
Michael continued, “but I suppose that
was because she was the one actually
experiencing the pregnancy. But being
the father, I had a lot of emotional feel-
ings about the baby, too. In a bit-
tersweet way, I relished being a father
for the ﬁrst time. I was able to feel

somewhat excited and proud whileat ‘A
the same time, I did not second-guess
my resolution [for the adoption].”_~' . I

“I had it better than a lot of other
girls in the same predicament,” admit-
ted Nikki. “I had the support of my
boyfriend and family. But still, it was
a very hard time. I was excited with
the changes going on in my body. I ate
healthy foods, exercised, and all for the
beneﬁt of the baby. Often I became bit-
ter that I could not enjoy my pregnan-
cy the same way that a mother who was
going to keep her child was.”

But with the decision made to go
through with the pregnancy and then
go through with an adoption, the next
step was deciding whether to place their

child through an agency or a private
adoption. In Allegheny County last
year, out of.4l5 adoptions, 83 were
non—agency.

Babies can privately be placed by
physicians, attorneys, clergymen,
parents, relatives or just about anyone
who has access to an adoptable baby.

The biggest advantage for pregnant
women considering private adoption is
that the parents can know who their

‘child is going to and be relieved know-

ing of their competency. In most cases,
the adoptive parents are willing to pay
the cost of the medical expenses, sav-
ing the birthing parents about $1,500.

Visual advertising is the most com-
mon means for pregnant women to get
involved with private placements.
Classiﬁed ads can be ‘found in subur-
ban and college newspapers, ﬂiers and
even billboards.

Beth Ann and Rod Machert are one
couple from Albany, who repeatedly
place ads in The Pitt News that read
“Pregnant? Well-educated, loving cou-
ple, unable to have children, seeking
to adopt baby. Will pay all medical ex-

Modern sorority sisters endeavor

to improve their ‘ ‘clique’ ’ reputation

By Kathy Campell

Staff Writer
Nationally, they are known as
sororities. They call each other

“sisters.” But it‘s all “Greek” to those
not involved. What is a sorority, and
what type of girl does it take to join
such an organization‘?

“To anyone on the outside, sororities
could be viewed as cliquish," said
Panhellenic President Laura Ferlin.
The Panhellenic Association is the
governing body of the sororities. “Our
main goal is to get to know as many
girls as possible and hope that we can
get more to join us. We’ve really been
working a lot lately at this goal.”

There are 15 sororities here at«Pitt,
some of which are part of national
organizations. The Panhellenic Coun-
cil is made up of a president and a
representative from each sorority. The
Jr. Panhellenic Association is made up
of officers from each pledge class. In
order for a woman to become part of
this system, she must go through a
period of rush, and then pledging.

“As an insider, you get to know all
of the girls,” explained Ferlin.
“Everyone’s very friendly — these
girls are your sisters. I know. those un-
familiar with it might think that’s

queer, but everyone is accepted im-
mediately. "

The typical sorority girl, according
to Ferlin. is involved in her sorority,
but she‘s not limited to only that one
activity, as many people seem to think.
Most girls are also in student govern-
ment, or other campus activities out-
side of the sorority.

Ferlin admits that the image of the
typical sorority girl is still that of a snob
of sorts. It has been passed down
through the ages, and it is not an easy
one to_ shake.

“We’re doing our best to change that
image,” she said. “We try to have
events that will benefit as many peo-
ple as possible, and will involve dif-
ferent organizations. But people seem
to put all of that aside — probably
because we're such a close-knit
group.”

She also offered a possible explana-
tion as to why the Greeks don’t seem
as prevalent on Pitt’s campus as they
do at other schools. “It’s part of be-
ing in a city,” said Ferlin. “The
nightlife is much better here. There are
100 other things to do here — 100 other
organizations. We’re not set aside in
the country like other schools so that
if you're not part of the Greeks, you
can’t do anything.”

“Here people go off to their apart-
ments if they don’t live on campus,”
she continued. “We’d like to have as
many girls living with the sorority as
possible.”

Ferlin was elected president of
Panhellenic Association in January.
Her term runs until Jan. 1986. She has
been on the panhellenic board since her
freshman year. It was during that time
that she became interested in the rush
process, which caused herto run for
internal president. Once elected, she

was in charge of rush, which meant set- '

ting up the rush rules, as well as coor-
dinating the activities for the rush
period.

Her job as panhellenic president is
to represent the sororities at any univer-
sity function. When asked why she
decided to run for president, Ferlin
replied confidently.

“Given my experience, I felt I was
the most qualiﬁed. I’ve been involved
in budgeting, which is the main por-
tion of rush. Through my position of
internal president, I was able to meet
all of the chapters (sororities), and I
knew their goals, so I could help work
for them."

But knowing her fellow sorority
sisters was only part of what got Ferlin

Fraternities lose their “Animal House” identity

By John Zaphyr
Assistant News Editor

Interfraternity council president Craig
Strauss is trying to change the image of
the fraternities at the University of
Pittsburgh.

‘ ‘Most people think of the fraternities
as being something out of the movie
’ ” said Strauss, “guys
that chase girls all the time, don’t study-
at all and have beer parties every night.
I’m trying to create a positive image of
fraternities with the administration, the
student body and the community.”

Strauss, a 22-year-old senior majoring
in mechanical engineering, does not
believe that the stereotype of the male

‘Greek, the beer-guzzling, woman-

chasing wild man, is deserved.

“I view the Greek males as being a.

very diversiﬁed group,” said Strauss.
“There is no one way to describe them;
each fraternity is different, and it is hard
to be speciﬁc.”

The image that the Greeks would like
to portray is far different from the roles
Belushiarid Co. played. ‘ ‘A lot of Greeks
are very outgoing,’ ’ said Strauss. “They
have leadership qualities, and they are
achievers. They like to go for it.”

As IFC president, Strauss has had plen-
ty of opportunities to change that image.
‘ ‘We’re trying to get more involved with
the community,” he said. “We’re start-
ing to participate in BADD [Brothers
Against Drunk Driving] — a program
speciﬁcally designed for high school kids.
We’ll go into the high schools and tell

' them to be responsible when they are

drinking and driving.’ ’

However, they will not be telling the
high schoolers not to drink. “We're not
going to go in there and tell them not to
drink because we drink ourselves,”
Strauss said. “But we are going to tell
them not to drive while drunk or to get
someone else who is sober to drive them
home.”

The fraternities are also involved with
the American Heart Association and this
winter will be entertaining a group of
orphans.

“We’re supplying people to carry
around a Steeler banner for the Heart
Association,” Strauss said. “All Steelers
have signed the banner, and people can
pay to have their names on it also. All
the proceeds will go to the Heart
Association.

“Another Greek project includes
bringing in a group of orphans to Trees

Strauss became IFC president last
November after serving as president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for a
year, and his term is nearly over. His
duties as IFC president are still in full
swing.

“I’m in charge of all the meetings
where any business is discussed,” he
said. “I’m also the spokesman for the
IFC. I’m basically in charge of public
relations — any questions that come up
about the fraternities, I answer.”

As IFC president, he must also repre-
sent the fraternity system. “I try to pre-
sent myself well, ’ ’ he said. “That means
dressing well, speaking intellectually.
When everybody watches your every
move and judges your fraternity by the

way you act, you had better be careful."

However, there was a time when
Strauss had no thoughts of joining a
fraternity -— let alone representing all of
them.

“When I first came to Pitt I was dead
set against joining a fraternity,” he said.
“My parents, who were never in a Greek
organization, had the typical ‘Animal
House’ image of fraternities and wouldn’t
allow me to join any.

‘ ‘But I had a bunch of friends who were
rushing a fraternity and I decided to go
through rush myself,” Strauss continued.
“I didn’t join at first, but then I pledged,
without my parents knowledge, and have
been in »a fraternity ever since."

As IFC president, Strauss has seen the
role of fraternities grow in the past year.

penses.” The Macherts favor private
adoption because they see this method
as faster and less tied with red tape.

Rod Machert acknowledges that
private adoption ‘requires an aggressive
approach’. "__g‘!‘Bé’sid'es* newspaper ads,
you tell  know that you
are looking for .a ‘baby, ’ ’ said ‘Machert.

 “You tell"the_postman, the checkout
' clerk at the-supermarket, your doctor,

your librarian. You never know whose
friend has a niece that is pregnant.”
This new aggressiveness is not '
limited to private adoption. Agencies -
recruit-pregnant women through na-

" tional ads, some even seen on PAT

buses.

Nikki and Michael decided to work
‘with an adoption agency. “We did not
know where to even get in touch with
an agency and ﬁnally found Catholic‘
Charities by looking in the Yellow
Pages of the phone book,” said Nikki.

“The agency stressed from .the very

"beginning that they would work with

us free of charge, but if we chose not
to, we would not be obligated to give
up the baby after birth. Both Michael
and I were provided with counseling to
make sure that we were making the
right decision‘ [considering the adop-
tion] , ’ ’ Nikki continued. ‘ ‘Somehow-,
I-was never able to fully conﬁde in
these social workers. I felt that since

.' they were an adoption agency, all they

really wanted was for me to sign those
papers relinquishing rights to my
child.”

Michael also agreed that he did not
get that much out of the counseling.

.“I’m not convinced that the social

workers were always trying to help us.
None of the social workers that we en-
countered were really able to relate to
the predicament that we were. in,” said
Michael. “They made many sugges-
tions and threw out ideas at us, but by
them not really knowing us and what
we were like, it seemed to take away
the power of suggestion. Because of

. this impersonality, Ijquestioned their
- suggestions as to what was the best

thing for us to do as opposed to what
we wanted to do. _

. “Sometimes I felt that they were
treating our case as just a" job’ that had
to get done,” Michael continued. “The
social workers also seemed to have an
ingrained attitude against men. They
were usually surprised to see me, prob--

-ably because the boyfriends usually do

not stick around. They said that it was
great that I took such an active interest,
but they really did not’ believe this and

the agencies must try “to get a child

much, but at the same time, we bend
over backwards to give the birth
mother objective advice. It is in no
one’s interest for a mother to be

my feelings and got the frame of mind
to counter the emotional state I knew‘
that Nikki would be in,” said Michael.

“After 26 hours of labor, the baby
was finally born at 2 a.m. As expected,
Nikki was yery emotional. I was very

proud when I saw how healthy the baby.

looked,but at all times, Iremembered  .:

that I was not going to ‘raise her”.

the whole ordeal was almost over. I
tried to agree with Nikki, although I did
not feed her emotions because I was
afraid she would not go through with
the adoption. It was a strange time to
be thinking of practicalities, but I was.
Even after the birth, never at any point

I did it enter my mind to change my deci- .

sion,” Michael said.

According to the National Commit-
tee for Adoption-, approximately one-
half to two-thirds of all birth parents
who consider putting their babies up for
adoption change their minds either
before" the baby is born or_ soon after.

“I wish that I had been as strong as
Michael,” sighed Nikki, “but after the
baby was born, I was more confused
than ever. She was so tiny, and I
couldn’-t believe that she was mine. I
think deep down I knew that I would
give her up, but ﬁrst, I had a very
strong urge to be a mother to her. I
bottle-fed her at all her feedings, and
while-we were both in the hospital, she
spent the time in my room.”

When it" was time to _leave the
hospital, instead of putting her in a tem-
porary foster home I_brought her home
with me,.’ ’said Nikki. “I can’t explain
it,:but it was something I had to do.
Michael was furious, and the people at
the agency were adamantly opposed
believing that there would be no

beneﬁt. Most agencies advise against

any contact at all.

After three days at home, Nikki-

brought the baby back to the agency .'

. She was ﬁnally ready to sign the relin-

quishment papers.

“I definitely did not want Nikki to
take the baby home,” said Michael,
“but obviously for her, it. was the right
thing to do. I guess I just wanted her

I to avoid the hard points instead of fac-

ing them. But I had already made my
decision; she had not.” .

“We signed the ﬁnal adoption papers
about a month after she was born. For
me, the signing of the papers was mere-
ly a formality. It was a little harder for

Nikki. She was unhappy and crieda .,

lot, but at least she was certain of her
decision, as was I,” said Michael.

Nikki is adjusting to the idea of her
child being raised by other parents. She
still wonders but no longer has any

Michael got a letter from the agency

bright, attentive and incredibly healthy.

Pitt works to educate prisoners

By Bonnie Kartzman
Staff Writer

The striped suits are gone. But ‘the
building is still imtimidating. And so
are the barred doors and the time locks.

If it’s true that learning can take place
anywhere, then the state Correctional

Institution in Pittsburgh, maintaining an
approximately 16-year-old educational
program, proves the point.

The program began with a_ few
courses as a result of a community
outreach program in the late ’60s, in
which instructors of English, black
studies, psychology and communica-
tions volunteered their time in the max-
imun security prison. The program has
matured into an appendage oi me
University of Pittsburgh’s College of
General Studies. It is currently run by
the Department of Education.

In order to participate in the CGS
program, an inmate must have earned
the equivalent of a high school
diploma, maintain a C average and

make progress toward a degree. The r

ﬁve ﬁelds of possible study include:
English, communications, public ad-
ministration, applied economics and
psychology. Also offered are voca-
tional and Graduate Equivalency
Diploma courses. A ' ~

Dr. Fiore Pugliano, the
undergraduate advisor for the English
department at Pitt, currently advises the

prison collegiate program as well. He
has been involved with the program for
10 years.

“Once you start dealing with people
as students. a transformation occurs,"
said Pugliano. "After awhile, you get
to know them as more than a label; you
begin to discover that there are more
things to these people than the crimes
they have committed.”

Across the students’ incredibly
diverse backgrounds, Pugliano finds a
common factor: enthusiasm. Reasons
vary. “There’s only so much sitting
around you can do,” Pugliano said. i
“The inmates need to exchange ideas
with people who will talk to them as
people and not as convicted felons.”

Another reason for their interest may
be found in the case of life-sentence in-
mates, who might be thought to be
apathetic, but are “some of the best
students we’ve ever had-in the pro-
gram,” said Pugliano.

He recalled one inmate who re-
marked, “If I’m going to be in here the
rest of my life, I want to improve the
quality of my existence. I want to make
it tolerable.”

, Evidently, this commitment runs
strongly in the staff as well, for

although participation is on a volunteer
basis, many of the same instructors
come back year after year. One exam-
ple is Dr. ‘Robert Marshall,,who has
been involved‘ for seven years. In. ad-

dition to his current duties of teaching
basic reading and writing. Marshall has
taught medieval literature and sports
literature. His decision to return seems
to hinge on student response. "I find
them willing — anxious to learn," said
Marshall. “It’s one of my favorite
teaching experiences."

The educating process does not,
however, end just with a- teacher-
student transfer of knowledge. It‘is
perpetuated by the inmates themselves,
who have set up their own writing and
math workshops to help other inmates.

This mutual interest in learning also
results in a kind of education for the
instructors as well.

“I’ve gotten much more out of this
than I’ve given,” said Pugliano. “I’m
much less willing to categorize people
than I was.” His most important
gratification, however, seemed to be a
renewed “enthusiasm for human
potential. ’ ’

“Human potential” — just’ like that
is found in the story of a withdrawn in-
mate, who joined the program only
because it might-help him with proba-
tion. He eventually became very in-
volved‘, and when he was released,
went on to work toward a Ph.D. “You
would start noticing anintellectual rela-
tionship; he became excited by how
ideas could put the world together for
him,” Pugliano recalled. “You can
help them to make discoveries about

 1  .

themselves that they may have other-
wise not made,” he added.

Both the financial and academic
future of the program seem to rely upon
this educational cycle. Because the in-

mates are charged only a small registra— ‘

tion fee; most of the expenses are
shouldered by Pell Grants and a small
grant from the Department of Educa-
tion. This leads to a somewhat

precarious financial balance, or,
according to Pugliano, “getting by on

‘a shoestring. ”

But Pugliano said, "My feeling is
that the program has and continues to
survive because of the generosity of the
university faculty. who continue to
donate their time. and the enthusiasm
of the students. who keep the faculty
coming back."

The Greek systems at universities across the country are becoming as much as in-
stitution as the schools themselves. Repeatedly, though, the only articles that appear
in print or on television carry negative connotations. These incidents, as much as they
are rare, are also blown so much out of proportion that they taint the entire system,
not the individual exceptions. It's about time everyone learned the facts. ' ,

On a national level Fraternities raise over $6 million dollars and sororities over $3
million for charitable causes. This means an average of $90,000 per Greek society at
a national level. In addition, Fraternities donate more than 1.5 million hours and
sororities over 600,000 hours of community service time working with underprivileg-
ed children, sponsoring campus blood drives, and participating in neighborhood pro-
jects. In fact, many Fraternities and Sororities sponsor charities at a national level.
For example, more than half of Sigma Chi's 180 chapters participate in a campus "Derby
Days" ch_arity drive which tallies more than $150,000 nationally. The brothers of Pi
Kappa Phi have an annual wheelchair push—a-thon to benefit PUSH (play units for the
severely handicapped). Last year they raised $104,000 nationally.

Locally the Pitt Greeks raised more than $58,000 for Eye and Ear Hospital and 1200
pints of blood for nearby medical facilities. (Incidentally, the Pitt Greeks are the largest
single group donating to the Pittsburgh Blood Bank.) In addition to Greek Week, the
Inter-Fraternity Council organizes several community service projects. Last year a
neighborhood sweep was organized on Bellefield and Dithridge streets in conjunc-
tion with community residents. This year, Steve Fox, Public Relations Chairman for
the IFC, is working with the "Pittsburgh Sports by Ability Games Program" and the
Pitt Fraternities to help staff volunteers for a bowling tournament with handicapped
individuals. He is also planning an orphans day at Trees Hall staffed solely by Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Greeks who have a desire to help the surrounding community.

The Brothers of Phi Gamma Delta have established the "Brothers Against Drunk
Driving" campaign aimed at college and high school students. BADD has visited 20
area high schools this past year. Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Pi Kappa Alpha have in-
corporated community service projects into their respective pledge programs.

Chris Dancu, the 1986 Greek Week Chairman, was contacted by 8 prominent Pitt-
sburgh charities before deciding on "Helping Hand" as the 1986 Greek Week chari-
ty. Steve F ox reports being contacted by at least a dozen charities this past year desir-
ing volunteers from Pitt's Greeks for their campaigns. These groups have included
the American Heart Assoc., the Pittsburgh Blood Bank, and the WQED phone—athon.

The community surrounding any University realizes the generosity and effectiveness
of the Greek system on that campus. This is just as true at Pitt where the number of
students who join a fraternity or sorority is only 6.6% of the total undergraduate popula-
tion. It is interesting to note that this small percentage of students, 1258 to be exact,
presently holds a majority of the leadership positions on this campus. Five of the ten
positions on the Student Government Board, including the President are held by
Greeks. This is not unusual. It is also historically true. Even more impressive is the
fact tha tthe last seven terms a Greek has held the position of President of the SGB.

This phenomenon is true throughout the United States. There are 1,979 four year
colleges and universities enrolling some 5,980,000 undergraduates. There are Greek
chapters on 920 of these campuses. There are approximately 651,000 total actives and
pledges each year, meaning that 10% of all U.S. undergraduates are Greek. Once
again this small percentage has went on to lead — in this case, though, the nation.

Aproximately, 80% of the executives of the 500 largest corporations in America are
Fraternity men. More than 75% of our U.S. Senators are Greek. Of the fifteen Presidents
who had the chance to join a Fraternity, seven took advantage of the opportuniy as
an undergraduate and five more accepted brotherhood as a university alumnus. Ronald
Reagan, George Bush, and Elizabeth Dole (Secretary of Transportation and highest
ranking female government official) were undergraduate Greek members.

These facts and figures are no mere coincidences, Fraternities represent an American
institution fostering leadership, support, and organizational skills that are useful later
in liltt. lust <15; ili<- schools in which they reside become an important part of the com-
iriiinity, so do tlir» Greek systems on that campus. lt's obvious — when you're Greek

All of our present actions or plans of ac-
tion are based one thing: a dream. The
dream that some day, after graduation, we
will enter the "real world"— and succeed!
And I'm sure everybody would agree that
it is the lure of success that drives all of us
forward. But imagine spending several
years studying, obtain your degree and
enter the "real world" without knowing if
you can really make it; with an uncertain-
ty over your true abilities and with lack of
the crucial self-confidence; without any
previous experience in leadership. And
when your job or salary is at stake, finding
out then for the first time that you have no
leading skills, might be quite disastrous.

However the main point here is that con-
trary to what some people think, there are
no born-leaders and no born-losers.
Everyone has some leadership qualities
and everyone can become a leader. It is
just that some people have taken a better
advantage of the opportunities that they en-
countered in life. Because it is their oppor-
tunities and the experiences that give birth
to leaders.

Yet, in this very University as well as in
1979 others across America, exists a uni-
que system full of such opportunities that
let you put your skills to test. A system that
lets you experiment with yourself; find out
about your weaknesses or your strengths,
without the risk of losing your job or your
salary. This system is called Pitt's Greeks!

Its uniqueness comes from the fact that

and more than 180 committees and sub-
committees, waiting for the individual to
take advantage of the opportunities and
practice his management skills. Yes indeed
this great system can teach you a lot of
useful things. It can teach you first of all
about yourself; about leadership and
responsibility; about brotherhood and team
work. And in fact many people already
have used it wisely (as it was meant) and
gained the necessary background and the
basic skills so to face the difficulties of life
with a positive attitude. They discovered
the beauty of challenge; the satisfaction of
proving themselves; the sweet taste of suc-
cess. They learned not only how to fight
but also how to enjoy every single battle
and every single challenge; how to collect
on their way through all of the valuable
lessons of life, drawing every time an even
better course for their lives with higher
values and bigger demands. They manag-
ed to accumulate all these things and
evolve into more experienced and strong
characters and better leaders.

The Order of Omega for the fraternities 1

and the Rho Lambda for thesororities are

The Pitt News, November 20, 1985

Honorary societies which exist with the
basic purpose to reward those individuals
whose leadership abilities have helped the
Greek system to advance, and who have
made positive contributions to the Inter-
Fraternity system as well as to their own
fraternities. At the same time the
honoraries try to encourage others to follow
the example of these people and assume
responsibilities, by inducting the two most
distinguished members of each chapter
every year into their membership. Most of
the fraternities’ presidents, present and
past Student Government Board members,
committee chairmen and IFC oicers have
all been members of the Order of Omega
or Rho Lambda. By working hard and
assuming responsible positions within their
chapters or IFC/Panhellenic they took the
first steps to get accepted into the Order
of Omega or Rho Lambda.

1 hope that those of you who are already
Greeks are taking advantage of the many
opportunities that the Greek system has to
offer.For those of you who are not Greeks,
this 1anuary's rush is your chance to find
yourself. We of the Order of Omega and
Rho Lambda are always looking for some
few good members.

For three days during Winter term, represen-
tatives from the National lnterfraternity Conference
(NIC) will conduct an evaluation of Pitt's fraterni-
ty system. The evaluation, requested by the Inter-
fraternity council, will consist of meetings between
various University administrators, students, com-
munity leaders, alumni, and fraternity members.
The goals of the evaluation will include determin-
ing the strengths and weaknesses of the Interfrater—
nity Council and giving specific suggestions for im-
proving recruitment and programming areas.

The evaluation, which will occur in late lanuary
or February, will be funded by the lnterfraternity
Council and the Office of Student Activities. No
less than six weeks after the evaluation, the NIC
will send a complete report of their findings and
suggestions to the Interfraternity Council.

Plans for the evaluation began in April when a
letter of interest was sent to NIC regarding their
evaluation program. Over the past months the In-
terfraternity Council has completed a thorough ap-
plication and has sent pertinent materials to N IC.
Two or three men who are members of fraternities
not represented at Pitt will comprise the evalua-
tion team. The NIC consists of 57 member frater-
nities and was founded in 1909.

Previous NIC evaluations have been conducted
at the University of Pennsylvania and Gettysburg
College. A similar evaluation for the sorority
system by the Nationaf Panhallenic Conference
(NPC) may occur during the 1986-1987 academic
year.

A PUBLIC RELATIONS UP-DATE

By Stephen Fox, IF C's Public Relations Chairman

The InterFraternity Council's Public Relations committee has recently developed
into a‘useful tool for communicating that which Fraternities represent as well
as providing service projects which allow overall IF C participation.

After the Colby and Amherst incidents of 1983, when the Greek Systems at
these institutions were disbanded, the IF C at Pitt began to wonder how the frater-
nities were perceived by non-Greeks. The Public Relations Committee (then the
Fraternity Unification Committee) began researching and eventually discovered
that _the non-Greek community did not have much information to base an ac-
curate judgement about the Greeks.

The task then was to explain to the non-Greeks aspects of the Fraternal System
at Pitt that were not evident. The committee decided that action would convey
these aspects better than words; and in the past year-and—a-half many such ac-
tions have occured and received an overwhelming response.

A neighborhood clean-up took place recently on Dithridge Street which in-
volved all of the residing fraternities picking up garbage and other trash in an
attempt to beautify the area. The response from the neighbors was positive, with
some of them thanking the fraternity members while they were still cleaning!
More recently in addition to many fraternities sponsoring their own charity events
and community projects, the IFC has provided a common ground for the frater-
nities. On November 12th and 16th fraternity members will be volunteering at
the Citipark's Sports by abiltiy Fall Bowling Tournament, a tournament with over
800 participants. The Student Health Service's Festival of Health is another ac-
tivity that the IF C is endorsing its members to support. Still on the planning blocks
is a Big Brother Day. On this day in January the Greeks will volunteer to teach
young orphans between the age of ten and eighteen the basics of racquetball
and basketball.

As you can see the fraternities at Pitt are determined to draw out the shouts
of misjudgement, and they will continue even when these shouts become cheers.

Fiji B.A.D.D. Program

Phi Gamma Delta fraternity (Fiji) has begun a program
called B.A.D.D. (Brothers Against Drunk Driving). The pro-
gram was started last year with the assistance of Mr. I .l . Tipp-

mann, founder and organizer of D.D.A.D. (Drinking Drugs,

And Driving) and Peggy Stewart a social worker.

F iji’s B.A.D.D. program is presently being processed and
registered with the state of Pennsylvania asa recognized
organization such as D.D.A.D. B.A.D.D. was formed to make
the student population and the university publicly aware of
the effects of drugs and alcohol. The B.A.D.D. program is
also beginning a training program for Fiji brothers and other
Pitt Greeks, to enter into the area high schools and talk with
the students, offering further assistance on drug and alcohol
awareness. The program gives us the opportunity to meet on
a common ground with the high school junior and seniors
about drinking and driving. The B.A.D.D. program was not
started to say that as a group we don't drink, or are against
drinking. The social atomsphere is a integral part of college
life. Instead of trying to deny that we don't drink, or are
against drinking. The social atomsphere is a integral part of
college life. Instead of trying to deny that we don't drink,
we are trying to make people socially aware and encourage
them to act like responsible adults, in which they wish to be
classified as.

This is a program which Fiji welcomes encourages all to
help and support. It is our future goal to have several pro-
grams similar to B.A.D.D. on every college campus. It is the
policy of Phi Gamma Delta to keep the life of the party alive,
a policy that we can all learn to live with.

“I think being in a sorority has

“Being in a sorority is a positive ex-

Pitt,” he said. “We had a record amount
of rush sales this year and had a good
season for pledges.”

Strauss attributes part of the reason for
the upswing to a rising feeling of conser-
vatism that is pervading campuses.
“More young people are conservative
these days,” he said, “and fraternity
members are viewed as conservative.”

He also sees fraternities as a way of
getting freshmen involved in campus life.
“We try to get the new students involved
in campus activities,” he said, “whether
it be with parties or football games or
charities, and I think more students see
that."

Strauss, born at Lake Wallenpaupack
in the Poconos, must also concentrate on
his own future. “I plan to go on to MBA
school after graduation,” he said. “And
then I hope to get involved in the stock
market as a stockbroker.”

For now, though, he must still concen-
trate on his duties as IFC president — a
position he will relinquish in November.

“It’s been a grind at times,” he said.
“But the position is much less hectic than
being a fraternity president. At least as
IFC president you can walk away from
your problems once in a while — as a
fraternity president the guys are there all
the time." '

The Pitt News

He has been called an “ambassador
of friendship and culture in America.”
Bob Baobing Lin is a Chinese massage
therapist, an instructor of Tai Chi

tioner of acupuncture.

Lin grew up in Fuzhou, China, and

studied political science in Shanghai.
He was a teacher and doctor in China
until he arrived in the United States in
1983. It was possible for Lin to come
to the United States because of the free
emigration policy.
' Lin came to America for two
reasons. “I had never used the English
language in a country where [it] is
,spoken although I had been teaching
' [English],” Lin began. “I had a strong
desire to live in a country where I could
put the language to use.”

Lin began learning message therapy
in 1970 because at that time he was
working with other intellectuals in the
countryside of Fuzhou. It was a policy
at that time for intellectuals to go out
and do physical labor.

“When people would get hurt in the
labor, I became concerned and learn-
ed to do massage therapy in order to
_ cure them,” sai__dALin. 4‘ ‘I learned from

Chuan exercise and_ is. also a practi- "

one of the other professors and also
bought books to learn from."

He then spent his next vacation at a
hospital in Peking learning this therapy
and practicing it. He also came upon
the opportunity to learn at the Research
Academy of Traditional Chinese
Medicine, at which time he was intent
on becoming a doctor. His change in
professions was due to “the suffering
China went through in the cultural
revolution. I didn’t want to be a teacher
anymore.”

Lin said he believes he is not only
bilingual but ‘ ‘bicultural. ’ ’

“This is true because I love Chinese
culture with all my heart. What I mean
by Chinese culture — an example
would be Chinese human relationships,

. they are very sincere,” said Lin. “Peo-

ple trust each other much more than
they do in America, yet I feel America
is a great country because most
Americans that I have known here have
great hearts.”

Lin said he sees many differences
between China and America.‘ He said

he believes the human relationships in"

China are much closer — whether in
the.family, at school, in an ofﬁce or
in a hospital. Also, in China, spiritual
value is placed highly above material

value. That means human interests are

serving as ambassador of culture

above everything. including money.
“Here. in America. I believe profit

comes first." He said. “service to the ,

people is the first model in China. The
second is responsibility to the people."
Lin‘s job was to serve the students and
help the younger teachers. He said that
college teachers are “considered a
precious treasure of the nation.”
Presently, Lin teaches Tai "Chi
classes at Camegie—Mellon Universi-
ty and leisure learning classes in the
afternoons here at Pitt. Lin also works
for the Golden Triangle YMCA as a

massage therapist. He has begun giv- ‘

ing Chinese massage therapy at St."
Mary’s senior center as well as
teaching classes there.

With regard to Pittsburgh, Lin said,
“I realize this city is highly cultured
with so many reknowned universities
such as'CMU and Pitt. These univer-
sities have been very kind to me. Pitt
is ready to learn from China,” said
Lin. “They have given me the chance
to teach — this is friendly“ to a
newcomer. It’s much more than just
saying ‘welcome to America.’

“Pittsburgh has opened its arms for
me because what I have brought is
some of the best parts of Chinese
culture, and Pittsburgh is cultured
enough to appreciate it,” Lin stated.

Can defense stop Dozier again?

By Patrick {Good
Staff Writer  '

Before a sellout crowd 1 and a
national—television audience Saturday
night, the Pitt defense must rise to the
occasion and meet the Penn State of-
fense head on. The major key to Pitt’s
success will be the performance of the
defensive unit, which must contain All-
America candidate D.J . Dozier and the
rest of the Nittany Lion offensive team.

Defensive lineman Dennis Atiyeh
realizes the challenge ahead of him and
his teammatesl “We will have to play
our best game on defense to beat Penn
State,” he said. “Not only is Dozier
a great running back, but they have
Tim Manoa and Steve Smith as their
fullbacks. They’re great running backs
also. It’s [going to require] a combina-
tion of everyone’s playing well on
defense to stop these guys.”

The Panthers have been tough on
Dozier. In his two games against Pitt,

the Penn State running back has

managed only 50 yards on 23 carries.
Those games are behind him. Dozier
will get another opportunity to prove
he’s better than those statistics show.
If anything, his two unimpressive per-

formances just may ﬁre him up that_

much_more.

‘One person who realizes that
possibility is senior defensive tackle
Bob Buczkowski: “That kid [Dozier]
has a lot to prove to a lot of people,

so he’s coming into this game with a ’

lot of conﬁdence. "I don’t think it will
be hard for him to get up for this game.
He’s probably going to look back at the
past two years where he hasn’t played

Tim Manoa

well and be especially ready'for this
game.” ' I

So how important is it to stop D.J.
Dozier, the 6-1, 210-lb. tailback? “I

i think it’s very important,” Buczkowski 9

answered. “I’ve been watching every
game he’s played thus far, at least
twice, and some of the ‘tackles he gets
away from are pretty amazing. He’s
going to present a lot of problems to
us.” .

Pitt defensive coordinator’ Bob Junko
said he feels Dozier is very impressive.
“He takes the ball and goes north and
south,” said Junko.‘

To defense Dozier, Pitt must do
several things in the game. Linebacker
Brian Shields knows just what he and

g Sports

lris'teammates must do Saturday night

"to be siuccessful. “Our defensive line

has to come" off the ball .They have to
dominate‘ the line of_ scrimmage‘, ” said
Shields. “Next, we have to shut—out
their fullback plays, and then, when
Dozier does carry the ball’, we must
make him bounce outside and keep him
running east-towest without turning it
upfield.” ‘ '

Head coach Foge Fazio said he feels
his team has defended against Dozier
very _well in the past, but this time
around, Fazio said he feels it’s a dif-
ferent ballgame. “In the past, our guys
have concentrated a little harder on him
and they’ve played well,” said Fazio.
“This time, they have to play even
harder,‘ because he has an even better
supporting cast. Their fullbacks are
damn good, that’s what I’m worried
about.” ‘

In addition to the running game of
Penn State, the Lions also possess a
very good passing game. Coach Junko
is well aware of that fact. “John Shaf-

fer is a solid quarterback —— he’s not’

weak in anything,” noted Junko. “As
a corps, they have the best receivers
we’ve faced, and they’ve got three
good tight ends.”

Defensively for Pitt, Penn State will
present quite a test for the Panthers.
How well the defense reacts to this
challenge should dictate the outcome of
the game. '

However, no matter how good the
defense does play it may not be enough
to win. For Pitt to come out on top, the.
Panther offense must score more than
the - nine points per game they’ve
averaged over the past three games.

The Pitt men’s gymnastics ‘team
ﬁnished -third in a ﬁeld of nine teams
at the Metro Open over the weekend
despite the strict judging of a new scor-
ing system. ‘

Pitt, scoring 252.6 points, ﬁnished

' behind Michigan State'(255.0) and top-

three-rated Penn State (270.6). Host
Navy ﬁnished fourth with 252.3 points.

Pitt head coach Frank D’Amico had _
his doubts going into the meet. “We '

weren’t really prepared as a team,” he
said-. “No one was in really good

shape.” He‘ also noted that this was,

Pitt’s first- competition " and that
November was.very early for a meet.
Because of the new scoring system,

_ “the judging was difﬁcult but hard for

everyone,”-D’Amico said. “Our score
w'as_'quité acceptable. It would have
been nice to beat Michigan State. We
were leading them by eight points at
one point in the meet.” Pitt dropped
to third after drawing their weakest
events in the ﬁnal rotation. Michigan
State drew their strongest events.
1985 NCAA qualiﬁers Mark Klafter,
Matt Peters‘ and Jorge S_anchez all had
outstanding performances for Pitt to
take honors on several events. “Our

Last weekend against Syracuse, O’Neil
captured ﬁrst place in three different
events, while leading the Lady Panthers
to an 82-52 victory over the
Orangewomen.

“She did just a real tremendous job
against Syracuse,” conﬁrmed women’s
swimming head coach David
Belowich. “She set a pool record in
one event, breaking a mark that stood
since 1979, and it was one of the fastest
dual meet times she has ever had.”

O’Neil’s record-breaking perfor-
mance came in the 200-yard breast
stroke. The Webster, N.Y., native
touched out with a time of 2:24.58, but
that wasn’t all. O’Neil also won the
200-yard individual medley and was
part of Pitt’s triumphant 200-yard relay
team. Always a dedicated athlete,
O’Neil made her long hours of prac-
tice pay off last weekend.

“I would have to say that she is one
of the hardest workers whom I have
ever coached,” Belowich said. “As a
matterof fact, we will back off and take
it easy a little bit in practice, and she
won’t like it.”

O’Neil is slowly establishing herself
as one of the top swimmers in the Big
East. She is the reigning Big East
champion in the 200-yard breast stroke
and was part of Pitt’s 200-yard, Big
East champion relay team. She is
respected by her opponents and

 

- Athlet of ms Week Jodi O’il

especially by her teammates.

“We really rely on her in terms of
leadership,” Belowich said. “She leads
well by example.”

One example she sets is winning,
which she does a great deal of. She still
holds a meet record set in the 1984 Big
East meet. This time the event was the
100-yard breast stroke. It is a practice
that is common not only to O’Neil, but
-to her teammates as well. Evidence of
the fact was last weekend when O’Neil
and the rest of the Lady Panthers won
14 of the 16 total events at Syracuse.
Not bad for a dav’s work.

NFL Roundup

Honorable Mention: Marian
Cassidy — the sophomore swimmer
from Wilmington, Del., ﬁnished No.
1 twice against Syracuse. More impor-
tantly, Cassidy provided the most ex-
citing performance of the meet in the
800—yard freestyle relay. Trailing by

» close to half a pool length when she

entered the pool, Cassidy swam a per-

sonal best 1:58.2 split and touched out
ﬁrst for another Pitt victory.

Curtis Aiken — the junior point
guard from Buffalo, N.Y., scored 17

Bears make game of the year a laugher

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

It had been billed as “the Game of
the Season,” Chicago’s bruising Bears
diversely matched against pro foot-
ball’s golden boys from Dallas. Power
versus precision. Guts versus glory.
Rambo versus Zorro. Final score:
44-O, Chicago. So much for the
swordsmen.

Led by Walter Payton and a brazen,
wicked defense, Chicago brutalized the
timid Cowboys in every aspect of the
game and dealt them the worst loss in
the history of the franchise. The Bears
bolted out to an early 7-0 lead, as
defensive tackle Richard Dent picked
off a deﬂected Danny White pass and
carried it into the end zone. From then
on, it was a walk in the woods for the

Bears. Chicago rolled up 378 total
yards on offense while not allowing
Dallas to penetrate any further than the
Bears 38. The most frightening aspect
of this Bear win was that they were able
to bully Dallas without their starting
quarterback, Jim McMahon.
Revenge, NFL-style. How nasty it
is. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had
their clocks rightfully cleaned Sunday
in the Meadowlands by a perturbed
group of athletes from New York.
Directed by the vastly improved Ken
O’Brien, the New York Jets scored 41
first-half points en route to a 62-28
obliteration of lowly Tampa. Why the
revenge factor? Last season, with Tam-
pa Bay owning a comfortable 27-point
lead over the Jets late in the contest,
former head coach John McKay
tastelessly ordered an onside kick.

When it was unsuccessful, the Buc-
caneers allowed New York to score so
that Tampa running back James Wilder
would have one last opportunity to
break the NFL season record for total
offense (which he never did). Oh, those
New York tempers.

New England and Seattle, two equal-
ly matched teams, went head-to-head
in a crucial AFC battle with potential
playoff spots on the line. The Patriots
came out of the Kingdome with the
edge and a hard-fought 20-13 win.
With the game tied and the Seahawks
at the New England 7, free safety Fred
Marion snatched a deﬂected Dave

Krieg toss and returned it 83 yards,

before being tackled at the 15 by a
hustling Curt Warner. Two plays later,
New England was in the end zone and

. the Seahawks were in third place in the

AFC West, a loss or two away from
playoff elimination. Rejuvenated
quarterback Steve Grogan of the Pats
should be receiving a Purple Heart any
day now.

Penn State

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

John Brown knows what it is like to
be in the shoes,Penn__.State_,,_i§_ now

Brown’s dream of playing on a na-
tional championship team was crushed
on a cool November afternoon at Pitt
Stadium as the Nittany Lions shocked
the Panthers 48-14.

“The thing I rememember about that
game is that we werewinning in the
first quarter,” Brown said. “And then
something happened. It wasn’t that we
got embarrassed, but it was like 
something from a Steven Spielberg
movie. It seemed like the sky was get-
ting dark and everything went wrong
for us.”

Everything did go wrong after two
Dan Marino touchdown passes gave
Pitt a 14-0 lead. Interceptions, fumbles
and maybe even a little peculiarity, as
Brown suggested, helped shut down the

Panthers’, i potent, offensive attack. . V,

disarrayed by its own mistakes.

It is four years later, but Brown still

“It is a big rivalry and it still has a

-‘though we are?on1y-5-4-1, 1 still think
we are as strong a program as we were
when I played, one of the strongest in
the country. We’re still ranked in my
mind.”

Pitt is in a no-pressure situation —
with a chance to upset its archrival;
however, Penn State is in a must-win
situation. -

The Nittany Lions must win to make
their New Year’s Day trip to Miami
more than justa sun-filled vacation. A
loss to Pitt would make Penn State’s
Orange Bowl game with the Big 8 Con-

Still, Brown would prefer to be in

pressure mounting.

By Shelly Ranus
For The Pitt News

They are the class of ’85, the latest in V

a long line of players to have worn the
blue and gold for the University of Pitt-
sburgh. For them, this week’s game
against Penn State marks more than just
the end ofa season. It means the end of
their college football careers.

Through the adversity and hardships,
however, this group of seniors has- kept
the Panther tradition alive and managed
to put all the experiences, good and bad,
in perspective. There aren’t any Tony
Dorsetts or Dan Marinos among them,
but that hasn’t really mattered. For these
Panthers, playing football at Pitt has
meant much more than just winning or
losing.

“The things that I’ll remember most
about my four years at Pitt are the friends
I’ve made and the good times I’ve had,
both on and off the football ﬁeld,” said
quarterback John Congemi. “Growing up

and meeting people on the football team

that I never knew before has been great.
They are a fun bunch" of guys and I’ll
know them long afte'r.—..I}ve left Pitt.”

“My four years here at Pitt have gone
by really fast,” said Bob Buczkowski, a
former high school hero at Gateway.
“I’ve met some of my best friends here
at Pitt. I’ll never forget the good times
and the bad times that I’ve had here. Win-
ning games has been great, but you have
to take winning and losing in stride. What
we want to dois go out on a good note
by beating Penn State.”

Tony Brown, an offensive tackle who
has played with the likes of Bill Fralic,
agreed with Congemi and Buczkowski.
“The past four years here at Pitt have
been very good ones for me,” com-
mented Brown. “I’m very glad to have
been associated with players such as Bob
Buczkowski, Dennis Atiyeh, my room-
mate John Congemi and all the seniors.
I feel the same way about the
underclassmen, too. I’m really glad I
came here and got a chance to meet peo-
ple like that.” .

All the hopes aridwaspirations for suc-
cess on the collegiate football field will
end after today’s game, but hopes for a
bright future as well as good memories
will live on for each one of these players.
Some will go on to test their skills in pro-
fessional football, while'”others will make
names for themselves in new careers. A
few, like Mt. Lebanon native Bob
Schilken, who’s headed to medical
school, will continue their education.

“I think the thing I’ll miss most next
year is not going to practice and playing
in games,” Schilken said. “After hav-
ing played football all my life, it will feel
strange next fall not to have to get up for
practice and look forward to a game on
Saturday. I know that wherever I am next
year, I’ll miss being at Pitt and playing
football with all these guys."

Thus, the class of ’85 has made its
mark on the University of Pittsburgh and
is ready to move on. The education they
have received both on and off the foot-
ball field will aid them as they aspire to
new goals and new victories.

Collier
prepares

Pitt for

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

While most of Pittsburgh is prepar-
ing for the annual “turf tussle” be‘-
tween Pitt and Penn,State, the women’s
volleyball team is gearing up forthe
Big East Tournament this weekend.
Pitt, undefeated in Big East play (8-0),
has been making a lot of changes; for
example cutting back on practice time.
This _cut—back has been intentionally
directed towards a higher quality of
practice, not a lengthly one. Coach
Shelton Collier explained, “We’ve had
a demanding travel schedule this
season. Recently, we’ve faced a lot of
nationally-ranked teams. I want us to
be sharp for the tournament, not worn-
out. Hopefully, by cutting back on
practice time, we are improving our
form. We should be prepared for this
weekend.” -

There is always the chance that Pitt
will be overconﬁdent, but Collier

_ believes it may help. “I think this will

work to our advantage. We will not
take any team too lightly just because
we’ve beaten them previouslv. We
have watched films of our earlier
matches with Georgetown and Pro-
vidence and know what we need to
work on. This season has been
somewhat frustrating and unfulﬁlled,
but I’m conﬁdent that they’ll come
through this weekend.”

Senior Sally Gillespie added, “Peo-
ple will realize the signiﬁcance of this
tournament and be prepared to win.
Right now, Pitt is more or less the team

to beat. If we play Providence, not only

.,BOuncing back

will they provide some stiff competi-
tion, but the game will be played on
their home ﬂoor, in front of their own
fans and with their own officials.
Hopefully, by Saturday, everything
will be clicking into place.”

Several disappointing losses slowed

Pitt early in the season, and injuries .

have plagued the Lady Panthers
throughout the 1985 season. Denise
Frawley came to the Panthers with high
expectations placed upon her. “Denise
will be a great player ‘down-the-road,’
but several key injuries hindered her
progress this year,” Collier stated.
“She will still ‘be a player we need to
rely on while we ﬁnish up the season.”
Sue Hoover is another Lady Panther
who is not yet back to par. She is, in
her coach’s words, “No. 1 all-around
player.” At the time of her injury,

Pitt s Nora Mulv1h1ll puts one away. ‘Dave Hooker/The Pitt News

 

Hoover was beginning to come back
from a previous injury. She is just now
starting to_ do light work in practice and
hopefully will be available for part—time
duty. The Lady Panthers are prepared

' to play without Hoover and Frawley,

though, regaining the service of these
two would be an added bonus for Pitt.
Seniors Sally Gillespie and Judy
Young will be leading the way for Pitt.
Gillespie was a major factor in the H
Lady Panther’s championship seasons
of 1982 and 1984. Young was selected
to the ﬁrst team All—Big East in 1983.
Young didn’t play last year, however.
“Both girls will play well because of
being seniors and wanting the cham-
pionship and the potential to once again
be nationally ranked,” Collier said.
“We have, for now, this one goal that

By Bob Travers

Panache —What are the cool things in the sporting world?   

The other day I was eating a dandy
lunch in the Towers Cafeteria when a
friend of mine sat down beside me and
pulled out from his pocket a small piece
of paper. My spaghetti was already
hardening, so with no desire to go on
eating, I asked him what the paper was.

“My favorite word is on it,” he said.

“Oh really,” I said. “What is that
word?”

A smile lit across his face and he
handed me the paper. In big blue let-
ters the word panache was written.

“This is real nice,” I said question-
ing my friend’s taste in clothes, cars
and words all at once. “But what is
it?”

“It’s my favorite word,” he
answered. He still had a daffy smile on
his face.

“Yeah, but what does it mean?”

“Well,” he began, “it means, you
know, style. Like being cool and in
touch with the '80s. That sort of
thing.”

“OK,” I said, “maybe you could

' Panthers. Question: Name three foot-

ball teams that are pitiful wastes of
talent.

Has anyone in Pittsburgh noticed that
ex-Steeler Wayne Capers has spon-
taneously’ become one of the most ex-
plosive wide receivers in the AFC?
Since joining the Indianapolis Colts in
late October, Caper has caught 17
passes for 292 yards, averaging a
gaudy l7.2 yards per reception. His
blazing speed and razor—sharp moves
have been devastating the secondaries
of Colt opponents. Obviously, Chuck
Noll had some personal quarrel with
Capers, because the former second
round draftee wasn’t waived due to
lack of talent.

we can achieve. I think we will rise to

the occasion. We’ve been working on

our serving this week, speciﬁcally on
the areas where opponents could

display a little weakness in the receiv-

ing department. I trust and respect our
players as competitors and I’m conﬁ-

dent that they’ll come through this
weekend. We’re in a position to play

very well and exhibit the kind of caliber
were capable of playing.”

The Lady Panthers are 24-10 overall. '

This is the first time in six years that
Collier has not been able to win a
minimum of 30 games in a single
season. Pitt has the chance to regain
a national ranking if they advance to
and win the first round of the NCAA
tournament. They will then fall among
the top 16 teams in the nation.

As Collier said, “We’ve gone
through the season and now’s our time

4 to play well and have fun.”

give me some examples, because I still
don’t think I understand.”

My friend considered this for a few
seconds. Suddenly his eyes widened
with enlightenment. “Madison Square
Garden has panache. So does PPG
Place and the Bonaventure Hotel in Los
Angeles. And the Boardwalk in
Wildwood, N.J

I was beginning to get the idea. “But
what about people who have
panache?”

“Crocket and Tubbs, ” he answered
immediately.

With that he got up and left, leaving
me to build houses with my spaghetti
like Lego building blocks. I started

thinking about guys in sports who had

panache. At ﬁrst nobody came to mind.

, Who, I wondered, was that rare athlete

who combined grace and power to win
with style and make it all look easy?
That is panache.

Eventually, I thought of a few peo-
ple who ﬁt the bill. Bjorn Borg had
panache. He looked like some guy who

dropped out of the New Testament,
with his long golden hair and unshaven
face. He always won and never com-
plained about anything. Borg
dominated tennis consistently in the
1970s, winning over such crybabies as
Jimmy Connors and Ilie Nastase. Borg
always won with class.

Mario Lernieux has a lot of panache.
He is another with style and grace to
spare. A great PR player for the
Penguins, Lemieux is everything
America expects its great athletes to be.

The Alabama offensive backﬁeld of
the late 1970s. I don’t know exactly
why, but it is hard to look more stylish
and “in” than when you’re running out
of the wishbone wearing a cut-off crim-
son jersey with the stadium lights
reﬂecting off your helmet like the full
moon glistening off a quiet lake at rnid-
night. (Ouch! How was that for a
smile?)

The New York Yankees. As long as
this team wears the pinstripes, it will
have panache. ’Nuff said.

Guy Laﬂeur. The former Montreal
Canadians superstar may not have
scored as a many goals as Wayne Gret-
zky (who sort of has panache), but the
ones he did score were so pretty they
could have hung in the Lourve and
passed for works of art.

Julius Erving nearly deﬁnes the word
every time he steps on the court. The
consummate basketball player, Erving
can make even the most routine play
magic. He is another who conducts
himself only with the utmost class.

In the interest of space and your
growing disinterest in this article, I

"shall list in no particular order those

who have panache. I should note that
these selections have been confirmed

 

as deserving by the American Associa-
tion of Panache People and by the July.
12 issue of People Magazine.

So here they are, more people with
panache: the Los Angeles Dodgers,
Dwight Gooden, Phil Esposito, Tony
Dorsett (sort of), Tom Osbourne (foot-
ball coach at Nebraska), Jim Urban, the

color of UCLA’s football and basket-I '

ball uniforms, the Orange Bowl
halftime show, Keith Jackson, the
Notre Dame ﬁght song and sports
movies where somebody dies at the
end.

I know that some of the above are
not people, but so what? I also know
that this article has probably broken the
record for the most cliches used in one
piece. Again, I don’t care. If you do,
count the cliches and send them to us.

I -. Sunday; .  ' . “  "

Pitt entered. this game with much
determination as well as some -of the
best puck pushers and goalies in the
' league — but the Panthers were soon

reminded that talent and determination
can only take a team so far.

“Navy had a terriﬁc team. They
were real organized,” said Pitt left
wing Tim Ross. “They played very
good position and just never stopped
moving. They kind of caught us off
guard.”

Navy’s strength lies in its overall
physical conditioning as well as the
team’s opportunity to hold practice dai-
ly. The Panthers, who are accustomed
to playing ‘l5—minute periods, were
faced with playing 20-minute periods
as guests of the Midshipmen, and those _
ﬁve extra minutes of play each period
proved to be Pitt’s downfall.

Pitt began skating with intensity and
scored the initial goals in both games.

 

 

 

The Pitt hockey team fell to Navy over the weekend’.

The teams battled neck,-and-neck
throughout the ﬁrst two‘ periods of
" play. But, as the game continued, a

p.m. before a capacity crowd at Pitt’
Stadium and a national television au-

could be the last opportunity to play as
a unit as their careers Come to an end.
Senior offensive tackle Tony Brown of
Stamford, Conn. , is ready for the Pan-
thers’ biggest game of the season.
“The Pitt-Penn State game means a
lot to me, especially since I am a
senior,” said the 6-5, 265-lb. lineman.
“With the record they have this year,
it is ‘deﬁnitely going to be a big
challenge. We’re not a top 25 team by
our record. But I think — talent-wise,
with the type of guys we have — if we
play as a team we can play even with
Penn State.”
I Brown has never received any na-
tional recognition because he played in
the shadow of All-World tackle Bill
Fralic who is now a member of the
Atlanta Falcons. Two years ago,
Brown played every game at right
tackle, and last year he watched as

the ground. Pitt’s running attack is
$13 00 $25 00 ranked among the nation’s top 25 and

that is an indication of how well Brown
and company are doing this year. Run-
ning back Charles Gladman has already
gained over 1,000 yards and will
definitely be counted upon to have
another sparkling performance against
Pitt’s arch-rival.

It has been a wild series over the last
10 years, with either Pitt or Penn State
being ranked No. 1 nationally ﬁve
times coming into the game. Brown
remembers the past three games very
well.

“Last year, it was a very big win for

~ - “The score was not indicative of th
game that was played. We rose to the
occasion. Both games the boys played

_ 110 percent. If we played every team

the way we playedthem, the scores in
this league would be very lopsided.”

Pitt will not have another opportunity
to seek revenge on the Midshipmen,
but the experience may have given
them a little more insight into where
the team’s weaknesses lie. The
crushing losses just may have made

them mad enough to do something .

We had lost to Notre Dame. Then we
got beat by Penn State and went to the
Cotton Bowl. It seems like whenever
we’re doing really well, Penn State will
knock us off. And now they’re doing
well and it’s our turn to knock them
off.” ‘

Since a'bowl game for Pitt seems a
remote possibility at this time, the Pan-
thers are looking at the Penn State
game as their bowl game.

“This is the seniors’ last stand,” said
Brown. “Bob Buczkowski, Dennis

Atiyeh, Bill Sapio, Bill Callahan and .

Brian Shields are going to get the
defense fired up in practice. On of-
fense, Mike Dorundo, Barry Pettyjohn,
John Congemi and myself are going to
get our guys ready. It is going to mean
a lot to us since this is our last game
together. It’s not a bowl game, but it
is the most important game of the
season. If we can beat Penn State, that
would giv_e this team a great lift.”
The Panthers are 5-4-1 as the season

I comes to a close, and a win over Penn

State would definitely be a shot in the
arm to a Pitt team who had high ex-
pectations about the 1985 season.

“It would be a climactic ending to
our season,” said the senior leader. “A
win would make people think that Pitt
is a good team and they didn’t have a
bad year after all. They had some
games they should have won but they
ﬁnished off pretty good and left a good
impression. ’ ’
