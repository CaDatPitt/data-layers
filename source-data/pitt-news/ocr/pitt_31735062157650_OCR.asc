Thief Grabs Coed's Purse

.The

From Thirteenth Floor Office

A black purse belonging to Miss Agnes Kristoﬁk, a senior, was
stolen Tuesday afternoon from a thirteenth ﬂoor office of the

Cathedral.

Miss Kristoﬁk, who acts as secretary. to Prof. Buell Whitehill,
head of the Speech Department, said the purse contained important

keys and papers, but little money.

Miss Kristoﬁk was just preparing to go home when the theft

occurred. She had laid her purse?

on her desk and stepped into Prof.
Whitehill’s ofﬁee. Coming out of

the otﬁce she saw a youth grab

her purse and run. V

' - Miss Kristoﬁk chased the youth
down the stairway to the seventh
ﬂoor where she lost him. She im-
mediately returned to the thir-
teenth ﬂoor and reported the
theft to Prof. Whitehill.

He notiﬁed the elevator dis-
patcher and a watch was put on
all doors to the Cathedral. But
to no avail. The thief had es-
caped.

Miss Kristoﬁk was able to give
a brief description of the youth
to the authorities.

“He was,” she said, “‘a young
man, short, with dark hair, and
was rather good looking. He Was’
wearing a dark sweater and a
Navy pea coat.”

This description tallied with
one given by one of the.workers

in the Photostatic room located

next to Prof. Whitehil1’s oﬂice
The thief had made a short visit
to the Photostat room before he
saw and stole Miss Kristoﬁk’s
purse.

Rehearsals are under way for the Pitt Players next production,

The play takes place in a middle-class home in Mid—Victorian

London. Especially diiﬁcult foi¢
the actors in this presentation of
ShaW’s well-known comedy has
been the development of an Eng-
lish accent. - -

There is sharp contrast be-
tween the reﬁned speech of Can-
dida and her husband and the
Cockney accent of Candida’s
father, the Burgess, and the sec1
retary Prosperine. -

Jack Schano, in the role of
Burgess, represents the typical
Cockney. J ack’s versatility as an
actor_is shown by a comparison
of his portrayal of the god Zeus
in “The Flies” and his characteri-
zation of Burgess, '

The title role of Candida is be-
ing ‘played by Anatalie Gefsky,

Dr. H. C. Carlson isn’t even taking time out for a rest, following

the close of the ’48-’49 season tomorrow night.

Starting Monday, he’s' opening the Pavilion doors_to basketball

candidates, collectively and individually, in a News—sponsored “talent

hunt.”

Sight of a big Pitt student working out with Duquesne Univer-
sity and the Altoona Pros this fall caused Carlson to arrange a three-

week open house and the Newsé '

to back it.

Dirth of capable manpower,
with Sammy David“ and Dodo
Canterna departing, necessitates
the search.for new blood.

Carlson urges all students to
drop in and undergo his surveil-
ance. All will be given a chance
to play in two‘ daily games, be-
ginning at 4 p. m., Mondays
through Thursdays.

“Some people don’t _try out for
the team because they think my
system is too complicated. It
really isn’t,” Doc says.

Although they didn’t “win ’em
all,” Carlson praised every last
one of his players. V ’

“They’re better than the guys
who criticize therﬁ from the
stands,” he observes.

The best prospects during the
News-Carlson hunt will be in-

, vited to April squad drills.

Infielders, Ouffielders

Candidates for the positions
of outﬁeld or inﬁeld on the Pitt
baseball team are ‘requested to

season. _ .

The lune is also the last col-

David and Dodo Canterna, Pitt
stars, will -take part. David goes
into the game with a season,scor-
ing total of 383 points, and will
try to run his mark to 400.

It is almost certain that David I

will wind up the season as the
city’s leading scorer. He is now
far ahead of Tech’s Mile Theo-

Cooper. Earlier this year, David
passed Charlie Hyatt’s Pitt record
of 314 points scored in one sea-

School of Nursing Wcrlrsliap

Trains Nurses For industry

_ In today’s world, far removed

from the Florence Nightingale of

the bloody battleﬁelds, a crying need arises for nurses trained to cope
with problems of industrial personnel.

Pitt is one of the few universities to realize this need and has set"

up workshops compensating forythis lack. The University of Pitts-
burgh School of ‘Nursing offers undergraduate work in industrial
nursing to graduate and registered nurses with at least one year of

nursing experience and necessary¢

personal aptitude.

This training prepares_the nurse
to understand a worker’s needs
while on the job and at home and
increase over-all output. The in-
dustrial,-nurse’ is no mere ﬁrst-
aid nurse, but a vital part of any
large industry, correlating the
work of management and labor. ~

Students in‘ Pitt’s workshop
have the opportunity of actually
participating in the work they are
preparing for. The co—operation
of such industries as Aluminum
Company ‘of America, Westing-
house Electric Corporation, and

discuss personal health problems,

views following physical check-
