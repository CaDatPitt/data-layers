By TOM BRYANT

.Dean of Students, William
L’. Swartzbaugh was the prin-

session of Men’s:Council. Dr.
Swartzbaugh‘ attended’ the
meeting. to. discuss the pres-
sent campus judiciary system.

Concerning dormitory problems.
Dr. Swartzbaugh stated that when
a situation arises, conflicts are
handled at ‘their point of origin.
If the problem cannot be remedi-
ed, in the dormitory itself, it is
referred“ to a member of the uni-
versity staff. . s

In cases of cheating, gradepro.-
blems or other matters of faculty-.

deans and their respective com-
mittees are consulted. ' ~
Finally, at the present time.
the university is not’ handling
the payment -of parkingfﬁnes.‘
Students must appearbefore a
squire in Wilkinsburg. ~ .
First ‘violations usually brin
only a warning. However, if
parking violations" continue, a
ﬁne‘ is levied -up on the student.“
Dr. Swartzbaugh and the mem;
bers‘ of M.C. ultimately agreed
that the judicial, system must be
a matter of. complete coordina-
tion and co-operation of all stu-
d-nts and faculty organizations.

‘Harry Berry, student desk sup-

thought the cathedral was burn-
ing last week. ‘ _

Miss Rosen told Berry that she
smelled smoke, and ,he said he
saw smoke. He looked ;under his
‘desk in front of ihs desk, but he
couldn’t seem to locate the ﬁre.

Berry was in the midst of call-
ing Building and Grounds to re-
‘port a ﬁre, probably in the base-
merit, when Miss Rosen turned
around and walked away. from
the desk." ' - .

Then Berry spotted the. trou-

' fire. ’ ljlarry Debee, the elevator

dispatcher, grabbed’ her coat and
stamped the ﬁre out. “The fire’
was probably caused by some-
one who ,had a ‘cigarette and
bumped Miss Rosen as she was
walking out of the Tuck Shop,"
said Berry.

Miss Rosen stopped to see Berry
yesterday, and told " him her fa-

damages. Her coat had been

Reid Pro Eccentricity, Individuality

By LOIS DIAMOND

 

, ~ “Everything is‘ so amazing;”
Jjj;  commented "Poet Alastair ‘Reid at
 \the Wednesday Midday’ program,
| ‘ “it’s amazing that We don’t melt
away in our baths like a,cube of

’ .. _’ Reid, a Scottish born\poet now
V 1,". ‘:f'residing in Spain, qualiﬁes as an
« ,, expert on this subject, being
 somewhat. of an eccentric himself.
fEccentricity, according-_ to
Reid, is “‘applied individuality
. . . To realize one’s individual-

 ‘_ poet, Reid felt, can be called a

, The writer of poetry cannot re-

must‘ convey his image insuch a
way as to create a lasting im-
pression on the reader. ’ .
“Realization is the key ‘to
what the poet is trying to do
. . . Something known is dead,”
expressed Reid. “The dawning
of realizationis alive. To ex-
plain or analyze human experi-

“The poet is the care-taker of

magic rising out of language . . .
The explanation of the poem,”
Reid affirmed, “is always less
than the mystery it explains.”
“One can’t expalin away a poem
by reducing it toga few lines. I

Newest Grad School

a By NANCY FOLCKE

Teaching Americans about the present-day world, and
how to behave in its different countries is jus-t"one of the
many jobs of the university’s “newest graduate school.

The Graduate School of Public and International Affairs,
since it opened in September of 1958, has considered this a
vital point in better international relations. \ ‘

The School does not only train
its American students for work
abroad, but it also teaches its for-
eignstudents more about running
their new and underdeveloped
countries in a/“modern manner.

It also provides courses for

‘ Americans who want to make a

career in running local or gov-
ernmental affairs.

The‘ school was one of_ the
first recommendations t h a t
Chancellor Edward H. Litch-

. ﬁeld made to*university trustees
when he became chancellor. For

at": P.»-_x,_nore than a year he, together

.1.

.L'..,,,;, .. _:

with» De‘an Donald C. Stone,
planned the work of the school
and organized about two dozen
top professors and lecturers.
Because of the school’s inter-
national influences, each student
. learns from the other. There are

'seventeen n a ti o n a 1 languages V

spoken by the students from
twenty-four different countries.
First Applicant
Somdee,Chareonku1, from Ban-

Vkok, Thailand, was the school’s

first student. A section chief in
the office of the Thai civil service

commissioner, he applied to the.

university long before the school
had opened. _ ,
He is presently studying for
his MA in public administration
and after receiving his PhD,,he
will return to his home to help
form a better organized civil
service. A

called college students who have the elevator -buttons
hidden away somewhere. ' __  A
 lhegame is an annual one, having taken place‘ the
past three years. Such methnds as 25—cent ﬁnes and ultra-
‘violet lights have been used in the past in an attempt to
.halt the thefts. For a few hours-on a couple of different.-
days last" week, elevator services was stopped in hope of
"having the buttons returned. ._ K I. .
  “Some persons may feel there are more worthwhile
:_.t'hings' worrying about than a few missing elecator buttons. -
:Jwe,:do not see it this way, however. The most irksome part

The picture the layman gets of the musician is
compounded of various spectaculars and extremes:
the temperament of Toscanini, the witty :.silliness
of Beecham, the mutual hatred of the members of
the Budapest Quartet. The musician ‘is a foggy sort

(Boomkamp said ‘that they always play particu-

Cats Win Classes;
[Misses Meet

. By TED COLTON

,‘ ' T ' A boil and a mistake cost the Panther matmen their first
' "defeat of the season ‘Saturday at Ann Arbor, Michigan. _The
Cats lost their ﬁrst dual meet/17-ll to Michigan, a team that
is favored to capture the Big Ten, conference. .
The boil and the mistake were the ‘main reason for the

and Harry Dick, who made the
mistake, were the difference in the
-_meet. Martin, Cat 123 pounder,
‘ did not make the trip because of
— a_ boil on his knee. _ 4
Dick took his place and was
pinned in 1:05 of the first period.
“Dick wouldn’t get pinned by that
guy if he wrestled him a trillion
times,” commented Rex Peery. “It
was just one of those things wher
Harry made a mistake and Hoyles
was fortunate enough to capitalize
; on it,” the Panther tutor conclud-
7 ed. 0
, Martin Missing ”
 If Martin would have wrestle
 the --Panthers would have had at
._ least three more points while
. Michigan would have had ﬁve less
A . thus giving the Cats a victory. But
such was not ,_the case and the
Panthers now stand with a 3-1
record.
5 ,Without Martin the Blue and
Gold still had plenty of oppor-
tunities to win the meet. In the
157 _ pound class, _August Arri-
gone lost a 4-3 decision to Dick
Fronczak of Michigan. _
V In the closing seconds and trail-
. -ing 4-’3 «Arrigone had Fronczak on
his back and it looked as if he
[would be credited with a take-
down. But Fronczak had Arri-
gone’s leg and the referee decided

" that there_was no takedown.
Again in the 177 pound class the.

   

defeat although the matmen still had opportunities to win.
- _Dick Martin, who had the boil,¢ » ~

Panthers had a chance\’to come
out with at least a draw but again
they were denied. Len _Vuocolo
was ahead with twenty seconds to
go when Karl Fink made a des-
perate grab and took Vuocolo'
down with only two seconds left..
Vuocolo was very disgusted with
himself after the match.

On the bright side of the pic-
ture the Cats still have four un-
defeated‘ wrestlers.’ Larry
Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington arid
John Zolikoff all came through
with wins for the Panthers.
(Martin is still undefeated al-
though he hasn't’ wrestled for
the last’ two meats.) . —. 

Lauchle captured the 130 pound
class with a 3-2 decision over
Ambrose Wilbanks. Lauchle, who-
was expected to have ‘ an’ easy
time, had to battle down to the
wire .to win. Kelvington was at
his best against the ‘.,Wolverines
when he pinned Fritz Kellerman-
in 2:35 of the ﬁrst period.

In the 147 pound division, Zolj-_
koff won his third of the year by
dropping" Jim Blaker, 3-2, in an-
other close match. After this
weight class the Panthers failed to
capture a win. .

Joe Schmitt lost‘ his third of the
year to Dennis Fitzgerald of
Michigan, 4-0. Schmitt, however,
seems to be improving with every
match. .. I .

‘Panthers Triumph On Road;

‘The score was tied again at 62-62,

7 Of course at Dartmouth the Pan-

Fridley, Mills Shine in Win

By JACK

SIWITI-I

The Panthers road» jinx was broken Saturday against
‘Ivy League leading Dartmouth, 67-62, in what has to be
considered one of the biggest surprises of the Panthers “win

only at home’_’ season.

\

Dartmouth’s Big Green, favored to cop the Ivy League

title’ and go 'to the NCAA tournament, jumped into a 26-10

lead mid-way through, the ﬁrst¢
half." But John Fridley, who sat
out‘the ﬁrst 11 minutes, came in
and hit for 13 points and grabbed
nine rebounds to bring the Cats
within ﬁve, 36-31, at halftime.
Panthers Dick Falenski and Bill
Mauro caught ﬁre in the second
half and put the Cats ahead 57-53».

but a pair of free throws by John
Mills gave the Panthers their win-
ning margin. - ‘
Fridley Stars
At ﬁrst the hoopsters had trou-
ble setting up, as Dartmouth alter-
nated ‘ its man-to-man defense
with a slidingzone. But once that
was solved the Cats moved delib-
erately and in the ﬁnal statistics
hit 46 per cent compared to the
Indians 34 per cent. _ 7 ’
Fridley was‘ the P a n t h e r.
standout on both offense and de-
fense as he hit for 18 points and ‘
snagged _18 rebounds while _con-
tinually . blocking the opposi-
tion’s shooting attempts. " ,

Once again co—captain Mills

turned in an “outstanding perform— ,

ance hitting for 15 points and‘
gathering 7 rebounds. Mauro and
Falenski both hit for 10 points, but
they came in the secondhalf when
the Panthers needed a lift.
West Rallies .

There was no lift’ last week,
however, when the Panthers lost
at home, 76-66, to West Virginia.

,thers didn’t have an all-American
to contend with’.
Although Jerry West only
scored 19 points, he proved‘ him-‘
,-self an all-American by re-
bounding and continually _pass-
ing off to teammate Lee Patrone.
West and Patrone were a pow-

erful one-two punch.

Leading scorers for the Panthers
against WVU were Mills and Frid-
ley who ,tallied 20 and 12 ‘points
respectively. ' ‘

Steinhart Looks Good

With 7:35 left the Panthers ’went
ahead for the ﬁrst time 54-53. But
the absence of Fridley, who foul-
ed ‘out three minutes earlier, was
felt on the boards. West sunk a
pair 6f free throws and the Moun-
taineers were never headed.

K T Particularly impressive "was
the one man perofrmance put on
. by West when the Mounties
were behind. . Don 4 St’e/inhart,
who ‘relieved Fridley after he

fouled out, came in to do a

commendable job. “ ' ’

The Panthers play Carnegie
Tech and New York University, a
team that is regarded number one
in_ the East, this ‘week.

Worst Defeat

At West Point ‘
. Army’s powerful gymnas-2
tics squad handed Warren
Neiger’s Blue and Gold gym-

nasts their Worst defeat in
two years ‘ as they trounced

the Panthers 62-34 at West

 

Point. last Saturday afternoon ._ .~‘../»—’‘

and thereby gained their fourth
consecutive victory of the 1960
season. " r x

The only distinction that the

-Jungle Cats gained from the un- -

expected trouncing was the fact
that Co-captain Dave Hirst eas-
ily won his duel from the Cadets’
Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnas-
tics League champion, John
Aaronson, on the flying rings.
Hirst,‘ the 5-8, 145-pound senior. -
from Lincoln High School in
Philadelphia, ,was a slight bit .
shaky in several spots but still
managed to register 283 points
and defeat Aaronson by 32 points
mainly "because the Cadet star
suffered a severe major break
when he, failed to hold a hand-
stand at the start of his routine.
Aaronson, a junior from Cin-'
cinnati, Ohio, was almost in tears
as he stood helplgssly by and
watched Hirst hit his machine-
like routine to capture the much --
publicized ring contest.
Co-captain Don Kasner was the
only other Panther, to score a ﬁrst
in the loss to the Black Knights

‘of the .. Hudson. The all-around

Jungle Cat senior from McKees-
port reached-his lifetime high of

266 points in capturing. the par-

allel bars; .

The individual star of the day
for the Cadets was Captain Red
Seaward who tallied 268 points.

  Weekend   Trip    
  To Army Proves
  Disastrous

By LARRY HAGGERTY

It was a weekend like_ all other weekends, but we were there.

In this, case the we refers to the Panthers’ gymnastic, indoor track,

andisquash teams w-hile the so called there would be the United States
, Military‘Academy at West Point, better known as Army.

7‘ As has been the case in nearly all of the trips that we have
made in our sports career with Jungle Cat athletic teams, our bus
was approx1‘mately’l5 minutes late in leaving, but no one regretted
the extra time alloted them to ﬁnish their breakfast.

Coach Bill Summers and his nine-man squash team-_.left Pitts-
burgh on Thursday, afternoon since they had a match with Fordharn

, in New York City Friday afternoon so the remaining occupants on
the Greyhound special turned out to be C_arl Rees’s and Bill Br'own’s
track squad and Warren Neiger’s gymnasts.

No sooner had the bus started down Forbes Avenue on our
420-mile excursion than was the debonaire Mr. Rees on his feet
and making like a modern day Cicero as he lecturedithe boys
on_how “Emily Post” would prefer them to act during the journey.

Neiger, meanwhile, was anxiously awaiting the termination of
Rees’sM lecture so that he couldrclose his eyes and journey off to
dreamland. And sleep Neiger did, all the way to_West Point with
the ‘possible exceptions of our twostops on the Turnpike. /

But if you don’t believe that Neiger can be classiﬁed in the same
category as the‘ Roman orator, just ask’two of Warren’s prize gym-
nasts, Earl McConnell “and Joe Battaglia, if they were really practic-
ing gymnastics until 7:30 last Monday night. ‘

We had just entered the Turnpike at Monroeville when a loud
"quinque” thundered thrbughout the bus and a morra tournament
was underway between two of ‘Rees’s star cindermen, Ron Rush

/ and Roy Moﬁitt. For all of g you non-Irishman, morra, or how-
ever you spell it, is an Italian finger-throwing game with the main

object being to see who can/yell the loudest and guess the best.
After Rush had successfully proven to Mofﬁtt that he was the
track team’s best ﬁnger thrower, he -insinuated that_ this reporter was
a true “ﬁsh” at the game and ﬁve minutes later it turned out to be
Rush that was the actual “ﬁsh” .as our morra éoach atthe Health
Professions Building, Ed Hudak, would term it. '
It would be adding insult to injury to say anything more about
what happened at West Point on Saturday afternoon since most -
V of ‘us now realize that Army’s\track, squash and ‘gymnastics teams
are actually a wee bit better than the_ Panthers: trio of squads.
The highlight of the afternoon was Dave Hirst’s easy victory over
the Cadets’ John 'Aaronson ingymnastics on 'the ﬂying rings 283-251.
ast year Hirst downed the Army star in-dual meet action, but in
the Eastern ﬁnals it was Aaronson who came out on the long end
of a 558-551 score. Thus Aaronson should‘ realize that Hirst is not
only the best ringman’ intthe East, but also the entire nation with
the possible exception of former Panther, All-American, Tom Darling,

a life-long friend of Hirst’s.

To close our little visit to upstate New York, both the gym"
and track teams attended the 53rd annual Millrbse Games at
Madison Square Garden on Saturday night before returning’ home.

It was our ﬁrst visit to the Gardens and we,- along with 16,000

/

other track fans, were thrilled _to death when,.»John Thomasof Boston

At West Point _the_ Raquetmen

was the closest anyone came to

Army, whose record stands at

COMMITTEIESL: AN AAGONIIZING REAPPRAISAL“   

To those of you who stay out of your student governnient
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse for
inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee, "
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.
Last week the Student Council met at the Duluth College of
Veterinary Medicine and Belles-Lettres to discuss purchasing a '
new doormat for the students upion. It was, I assure you, a .
desperate problem because Sherwin K.‘ Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened ﬂatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. ‘5I’m sick and tired of mopping
that/dirty old floor,” said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively.
(Mr. Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had been
his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos is
‘much better off without the wart hog, who tuskcd him viciously
at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years is,.,I sup-
pose, not lightly relinquished._\The college tried to give Mr.

Sigafoos a new wart hog-—a frisky little fellow with ﬂoppy ears

and a. waggly ta.il—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back and

cried the harder.)

' /

  

  

T..

 

But I digress. The Student Council met, discussed the door-
mat for eight or ten hours, and then referred it to a committee.
' There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would ever

be heard of the doormat again, but they reckoned‘, without

time to fuss and fumble and experiment with cigarettes. They
need to be sure their cigarettes will never fail them—that the
ﬂavor will . always be mild and mellow-——that the ﬁlter will

always ﬁlter-that the pack will always be soft or ﬂip-top. In “

short, they need to be sure‘ it’s Marlboro——dependable, con-
stant, tried and true Marlboro. Smoke one. You’ll see. .

Well sir, Invictus Millstone chaired his doormat committee

,with such vigor and dispatch‘that, when the Student Council

met only one Weeklater, he was able to rise and deliver the
following recommendations: '

1. That the college build new schools of botany, hydraulic

engineering, tropical medicine, Indo-Germanic languages, and

millinery. , g .

2. Thatthe college drop football, put a roof on the stadium, ,
and turn it into a low-cost housing project for married students.

3. That the college raise faculty salaries by $5000 per year
across the board. ‘ / '

4. That the college secede from the United States. ,

5. That the question of a doormat for the students union be
referred to a subcommittee. ’ V ’

So let us hear no more defeatist talk about the committee
system. It can be made to work! _ ‘ @1960MaxShulmAI .

NANCY HIMMER
Uncooperative N ewsie

has been raised in the shadow of
the shining big sea water is Pitt
pNewsie Nancy Himmer. Btrn and
reared on Neville Island, with the
V '_i"r'ushing waters two hundred feet
‘from her back door, Nancy, a
:‘_ physical therapy junior, has for-
:" saken the turbulent water; of the
Ohio for the more peaceful en-
virons of Pitt. Here slie residesat
' : Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house,
 as a house manager, or as she
‘would prefer not to have it put, as
assistant house mother.» ,
‘A Surrounded‘ by a t;">utary of
the Mighty Mississippi all her
4- life, she naturally got the wan-
derlust. Traveling to Europe ‘last
summer, she wound up in Paree,
as a Pitt Newsie will do, and
stayed there a week.
-— But, strictly speaking, Nancy ‘is
‘one of our most modest or shall
9. we say uncooperative Newsieslso
 far. After- an intensive and
lengthy interrogation by our panel
of Newsie Quizzers, all we could
discover about her is that she
doesn’t like small talk, partic-
_ularly about politics, but rather
prefers serious conversation.
,There is a rumor about that her
nickname is Freckles, but it has
not been corroborated by Nancy
Newsie. -
. But‘ let ‘us conclude our little
_ , chat by giving up in despair by
 saying that "she is sweet twentee

They’re transmission engineers with Michigan
Bell Telephone" Company in Detroit. Burnell
graduated from‘ Western Michigan -in 1951
with a B.S. in Physics, spent four years in
the Navy, then joined the telephone company.
His present work is with carrier systems, as
they relate to Direct Distance Dialing facilities.

Dick got his B.S.E.E, degree from Michigan

" in 1956 and came straight to Michigan Bell.

A He is currently‘ engineering and administering

a program: to utilize new, transistorized re-
peater ,( ampliﬁer) equipment. _

Both men are well qualiﬁed to answer a 

question you might well be asking yourself:
‘f‘Wl1at’:,,in telephone company engineering
5 or me. ~ -

     

,3 SAYS DICK:

“There’s an interesting day’s work for you
every day." You ‘really have to use your "engi-
neering training and you’re always working
with new developments. Every time Bell Lab-
oratories designs 'a new and more efﬁcient
piece of equipment, you are challenged to in-

corporate it in our system ei’l1e.ctively'and'
4' economically. For example, I have been work-

ing on projects utilizing a newly developed
voice" frequency ampliﬁer. It’s a plug-in type
, -—transistorized——-and consumes only two
watts, so it has lots of advantages. But I have
to ﬁgure out where and how it can be used in
our sprawling network to provide new and
. improved service. Technological developments

‘ like this really put spice in the job.” 

ems BURNELL: \

g

 

“Training helps, too—a_nd you get the ‘best.
Through an interdepartmental training pro-
gram, you learn how company-wide operations
dovetail. You also get a broad background by

rotation of assignments. I’m now working-

with carrier systems, but previously worked on

repeater (ampliﬁer) projects as Dick is doing '

now._ Most important, I think you always learn
‘practical engineering.’ You constantly search

for the solution that will, be most economical

in thevlong run.”

There’s more, of course-but you can get
the whole story from the Bell interviewer‘.
He’ll be visiting your campus before long. Be
sure to‘ sit down and talk with him.
