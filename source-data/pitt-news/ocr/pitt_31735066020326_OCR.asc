ACLU questions  
Student Activities’ _

mud-wrestling ruling

By Jim U rban
Editor—in-Chief

Pitt's Office of Student Activi-
ties may have to clarify one of its
fraternity rush regulations, ac-
cording to Marion Damick, of the
American Civil Liberties Union,

and Dr. Conney Kimbo, Pitt's‘

vice president for student affairs.

The regulation in question is
Article V, Section C of the ”Poli—
cies Governing Fraternity Rush.”
The rule states that/’All rush ac-
tivities must be devoid of sexual-
ly exploitative components, i.e.,
exotic dancers, pornographic
films and the like.’’

PSU tailgating little funfor some Pitt students  

By Jill Carell A

Sta ff Writer

Tailgating at Penn State is not
always a party, especially if you
are a minor.

Two Pitt students, Steve Book

and Tom Kovac, both 19, can ,

vouch for this. They both re-

ceived stiff citations for underage

drinking before the Pitt—Penn
State football game.

.”We were walking with beer
bottles through the tailgates- at
Penn State. Steve said, ’Those
cops are staring at us,’ so we tried
to walk deeper into the parking
lot,” said Book. . -

”Then a cop said, ’Hey, stop!’
and asked us for |.D.,” said Book.
”We said we didn't have any.”

Thelstudents were frisked for
l.D., whereupon Book’_s was
found. ”We volunteered to emp-
ty our beers, but they said no,”
said Book. .

Instead, the students were
taken to the Penn State Campus
Police Station, and both were
given citations. Book was ‘fined
$217 and Kovac $100.

against the OSA, Damick said,
before it was accused by the
university offall rush violations.
After debating the case, the
ACLU’s legal committee decided
to act. ' e
In a letter dated Dec. 2, Da-
mick wrote to the OSA: ”The
ACLU is concerned that [Article
V, Section C], while possibly
well—meaning, is stated so vague-
ly as to infringe on the constitu-
tional rights of privacy and
freedom of speech and expres-
sion of the fraternity members by
curtailing their constitutionally
protected activities along with
those that may not be protected.”
The letter also claimed that the
OSA did not define terms such as
”sexually exploitative” or ”por—
nographic films” and ’’seemed to
equate exotic dancing'with por-
nography .—-— which [the ACLU]
would certainly dispute.”
Kimbo. said Thursday that he
would refer the matter to the uni-
versity's legal council to see if it
is vague. ’’If it is~thought vague,”
Kimbo said, ”we will“take steps
to correct it.”
Acting director of Student Ac-
tivities Joyce Giangarlo said

Please see. ACLU, page 3

-Book asked the police why
they were singledput when there
were obviously many other
minors tailgating. The police
responded, ”You were the vic-
tims at the time.”

Book feels Kovac’s Pitt sweat-
shirt may have had something to
do with it.

As a result of this incident, the
students missed_the game, be-
cause they couldn't ‘meet their
parents, who had their-tickets.

Book's father, a Penn State
alumnus, had provided Book and
Kovac with the beer, Book said.

According to Thomas Harmon,
assistant director of Pennsylvania
State University Safety, -Penn
State started cracking down on
underage drinking at tailgates ap-
proximately three years ago.

”This university recognized
that we had a serious problem of
uncontrolled underage drinking
on our campus,” he said.

”We have several teams of
plainclothes officers who observe
the underage drinkers,” said Har-
mon.

Minors aren't the only ones

given citations. ’’If we can iden-
tify the keg from which the~per-

son has obtained the alcohol, the-

.keg and tap are seized as evi-
dence. And we prosecutethose
providing alcohol to'min_ors,” he
said.

Penn State overem-
phasizes the drinking
policy  We are busy
taking care of bigger
problems.

Harmon believes this has resul-

' ted in a decrease of underage

drinking on Penn State's campus.
”We are writing less than half the
fines we did three years ago,” he
said. _g

”We’ve made a significant im-

pact on the number of underage‘

drinkers,” he said.

According to Harmon, the two
main reasons for this crackdown
are the following:

1. Drinking‘ at tailgates has got-

ten out—of-hand.

2. There is a concern of civil
suits at Penn State and other
universities throughout the coun-
try resulting from alcohol—related
incidents.

Pitt and Penn State fans are

‘notorious for having different

views on a variety of topics. The
police departments in both areas
differ also, especially- on this
subject.

”Penn State overemphasizes
the drinking policy,” said a Pitts-
burgh police officer, who wishes
to remain anonymous. ”Techni—
cally, we should stop them or
give citations, but we more or
less tolerate it as long as they
don't cause chaos,” he said.

”They enforce [the underage
drinking policy] at Penn State be-
cause they are a smaller police
force and they don't have much
to do, so they pick on th"_é little
things,” said the officer. ”VVe are
busy taking care of bigger
problems.”

According to Walt Waters, as-
sistant director of Public Safety,
”Underage drinking isn't a major

problem at Pitt.
”To spend manpower just out

looking for underage drinkers, we '

just don't have the manpower for
that,” said Waters. ”Everything is
in priorities, and the manpower
in the police d_epartment can be
better used.”

Waters said he doesn't feel
there is a need to control under-

age drinking at tailgatesat this I S I

time. ’’If tailgating becomes out-
of—hand, then my opinion would
change. But at the present time,

, we would rather utilize that man-

power in other areas,” he said.
”We’re more concerned with get-
ting people to and from the game
5 a f e l y. ’ ’

Waters does not stand alone on
the Pitt campus. . ‘

’’It is pretty calm around here
compared to Penn State,” said a
campus police officer who com-

. mented when granted anonymi-
ty. ’’It is a different group"ofj

people.

”At Penn State, they feel they 

are doing their duty,” he said.

”This is a college area; we can't‘ '
bust every underage drinker.” ’

WASHINGTON — Vice.-Adm.
John Poindexter, the former Na-
tional Security Advisor, appeared
before a closed hearing of the
Senate Intelligence Committee
Thursday and refused to answer
many questions, citing Fifth
Amendment rights against self-
incrimination.

Poindexter reportedly is seek-
ing immunity from prosecution in
return for any information on the
Iran-Contra affair.

Poindexter resigned last week
as President Reagan's national
security advisor after Attorney
General Edwin Meese an-
nounced the administration had
discovered that the profits from
the sale of weapons to Iran had
been diverted to the Contra re-
bels fighting the pro-Soviet
government of Nicaraguan Presi-
dent Daniel Ortega.

Such a diversion of money is
illegal without prior approvalby
Congress.

Also invovled in the affair is
Poindexter’s top aide, Lt.Col.
Oliver North. North was fired by
Reagan after it was learned that
North apparently was the master-

T

mind of the scheme that sent
money illegally to the Contras.

North refused to answer ques-
tions before the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee on Monday,
also citing the Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination.

Both North and Poindexter had
been subpoened by the commit-
tee last week.

Texas killer executed

HUNTSVlLLE,Texas —
Michael Wayne Evans, a former
mechanic who murdered a
church pianist while she prayed
for his salvation, was executed
early Thursday by lethal injec-
tion, authorities said.

Evans last-minute appeal to the
Supreme Court for a stay of exe-
cution was denied by a 5-4 mar-
gin, and the justices refused
comment on the case.

Evans was convicted of the
June 28,1977 murder of Elvira
Guerrero, 36, a pianist at the Se-
cond Mexican Baptist Church in
Dallas. Evans and a companion,
who is serving a life sentence,
also stole $40 in church offerings.

Meese criticized for
delay on Waldheim

WASHINGTON — Attorney
General Edwin Meese has come
under fire from many congres-
sional leaders for delaying a rul-
ing on whether Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim will be
barred from‘visiting the United
States. '

Many Jewish groups have
claimed they have proof that
Waldheim took part in Nazi
atrocities during World War Two.

In April, the Justice Depart-
ment's Office of Special Investi-
gations recommended that
Waldheim be permanently
barred from the U.S. in compli-
ance with a 1979 law denying
entry to anyone invovled in Nazi-
sponsored persecution during the
war. '

Despite the war crimes allega-
tions, Waldheim won the Austri-

A spokesman for Waldheim

did mention that ”he‘ currently ~

has no plans whatsoever to visit
the U.S.” .

The World Jewish Congress has
already turned over to U.S. offi-
cials more than 2,500 documents

which allegely prove that Wald- _

heim took part in atrocities dur-
ing the war.

Waldheim has admitted he was
an intelligence officer for the Na-
zis, but denies any part in
atrocities.

Poindexter remains silent; seeking immunity

compared what Lee wanted to do
to the South African ”pass laws”
— where a black may be stopped
by a police officer,and asked to
present an identification card at
any time.

On Tuesday, Lee had ordered

police to stop ”any black in a 7

white neighborhood” and had
said he had approved more than
$10,000 in overtime pay for 45
officers to cruise residential areas
and parking lots to ”stop blacks
who were up to no good.”

Lee said the crackdown was

‘A necessary because in November,-

79;-percent of all robberies in
Jefferson Parish were committed
by blacks, and 73 ppercent of all
burgulary victims were white.

Despite the retraction of the
order, the ACLU is demanding
Lee's resignation.

' Staff Writer ‘\

The Ambassador of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to the
United States visited the
University of Pittsburgh Wed-
nesday to discuss security in
Asia from a Chinese per-
spective. '-

H_an Xu, the former Vice
Minister to Foreign Affairs in
Beijing, said that both military
-and economic development
are closely related to the secu-

entire Asian-Pacific region.
”Because of the visible

growth of China's economy, it

I has enabled our country to ‘

live in peace and take its right-
ful place in the community of
nations,” Xu said.

Xu stressed that the security

. of a nation is twofold in that

industry, science and technol-
ogy in one sphere and nation-
al defense in the other are
intertwined. The combination
of the two results in the fastest

~ Xu. ”The highest institution for

and surest modernization of a
national defense system.
Admitting that many have
asked why China doesn't
resort to more sophisticated
weapons, Xu replied, ”We
simply can't afford the cost.”
”Economic reform has al-
ready provided us with a raw
bone for development,” said

[military] learning has just
been set up to do research on
modern warfare.” -

According to Xu, although
Asia is making great strides
toward political indepen-
dence, there are still many set-
backs facing them.

”Asia evokes such images as
tropical rain forests, shimmer-
ing fields of rice [and] snow-
capped mountains.  [While]
many countries have won po-
litical independence, Asia
is continuing its efforts on so-
cialist modernization,” said
Xu. '

Xu hopes to maintain stabil-
ity and peace in the Pacific
region but said the task re-
mains challenging.

”Many developing coun-
tries are still faced with serious
difficulties. Terms of trade are
worsening, [and] interest rates
are exorbitant,” Xu said. ”The
region faces two challenges —
peace and development.”

Xu said in order to accom-
plish these objectives, the
nuclear arms race must be
halted, and, more immediate-
ly, prices of primary commodi-
ties must be maintained at as
reasonable level.

”The goal of all countries
should be one of common
prosperity,” said Xu. '

doll in demandby  
Christmas gift buyers

By Bob Dvorchak

AP Writer

Robin Woods’ baby dolls don't
walk, talk, sing, yodel, drink bot-
tles, wet their pants, burp, blink
their eyes or come with a birth
certificate.

Their appeal comes from styl-
ish costumes in trendy colors
with plenty of ribbon and lace.
And one creation, Larissa, was
named fashion doll of 1986 in a
poll done by Doll Reader
Magazine.

”Do|ls create a fantasy for peo-
ple. A person looks at a doll and
may wish they looked like that
doll or thought they looked like
that doll when they were young,”
Woods, 43, said in a recent in-
terview.

”The fantasy is being able to
pretend what a doll can do. Peo-
ple who like tradition like to pre-
tend dolls can walksand ta_l_l_< and

do all those other things,” said
Woods, a child psychologist.

From a brick factory in Pitts-
burgh, 40 workers at Robin
Woods lnc. make 30,000 dolls a
year worth $1 million in’ annual
business. The company was
founded three years ago.

By contrast, Coleco set a toy in-
dustry benchmark last year by
selling 50 million Cabbage,Patch

dolls worth $600 million, accord— ,

ing to spokeswoman Barbara
Wruck.

Woods’ hottest selling item is
Larissa, a blue—eyed blonde out-
fitted in a peasant dress from
czarist Russia. The doll was in-
spired by the character Laura in
the novel Doctor Zhivago and is
precision made. _

”The detail is what sells. That's
what people like,” Woods said.
”We try to make a traditional doll
that is contemporary in color,

OSA ruling sends an
inconsistent message

It could be that American obsession with going to court may
be carrying us away from simple logic and compromise.
Recently the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity took a case to the

American Civil Liberties Union for review and possible action. ,

The case involved the Office of Student Activities’ ”Policies
Governing Fraternity Rush” and the legality of the following
regulation: ”A|l _rush activities must be devoid of sexually ex-
ploitive components, i.e., exotic dancers, pornographic films
and the like.”

In a letter to Terry Milani, acting director of the office, the
ACLU said, ”The lack of clarity and vagueness of the policy
create a ’chilling effect’ on constitutionally protected activities
when fraternities have to guess what they may or may not do.”

Perhaps it is time to use commo_n sense.

The case originally went to the ACLU because the OSA de-
nied a request by the fraternity to hold a mud wrestling event.
The OSA held that the event fell under the policy seen above
and therefore could not be held.

What the OSA decision signifies more than anything is a lack
of trust for the fraternity. Were there more respect for the frater-
nity system, the event would go off without a hitch.

The Resident Student Association has been holding a pud-
ding wrestling tournament as part of the Spring Fling event for
the past four years. The university has never voiced objections
to the eventwhen the RSA was the sponsor. Why, then, does
the university object to the same event when a fraternity is the
sponsor? If the student body is to have any respect for the de-
cisions of the OSA, then the OSA must be consistent in their
judgments- I I ; ' _ , ; -

Theopposition of the OSA to Phi Gamma De_lta’s proposed
mud wrestling event seems an arbitrary judgment, inconsistent
with past decisions and weakly supported by the vague word-

ing of the rush guidelines.

Latest epidemic sweeping the campus

The last day of classes_ has final-
ly arrived. Thank God. So I guess
the only thing standing between
a university of happy students
and Christmas break is finalitis.

, Yes, I said finalitis. For those of
you who are pre-med students
and for those of you who aren't,
adding ”itis” to the end of a word
means an inflammation of the
first part of the word. An exam-
ple of this is appendicitis, which
is the inflammation of the ap-
pendix.

Well, there is a huge case of
finalitis, inflammation of finals,
going around this university. It is
a biannual disease that attacks at
this time of year, then recurs in
the spring. It hits freshmen the
hardest because they have never
experienced it before going to
college. Upperclassmen build an
immunity to this killer of GPA’s
through experience.

There are some easily identifi-
able signs of finalitis. You should
be aware of these symptoms so
you can warn your roommate

“a.

when he begins showing them.
It’s the least you can do.

First, a finalitis sufferer will
wear the same sweats for a two-
week period, seldom showering
and never putting a comb or
brush to his head. The final part

of this first symptom is often _

cleverly disguised with a baseball
cap, so beware.

Second, a person under the
duress of finalitis will sleep dur-
ing the day and stay up all night
with books and notes before him.
The eyes become glazed and
bloodshot. Men's faces and wom-
en's legs become hairy. Towers
food starts to taste good.

Third, finalitis causes people to
drink heavily. In the morning,
people crave gallons of water to
aid a terribly dehydrated body
from the previous evening. Then,
on the eve before a final exami-
nation (by far the ugliest aspect of
the disease), people flock to 7-11
for gallons of coffee.

So there it is. A disease that has

been around for years and will

Hats off to Phi Gamma Delta
for bringing the rush policy of the
OSA [Office of Student Affairs] to
public attention. In the last few
years, the OSA has become the
tyrannical model of upstanding
morality and impracticality.

Rush is a competitive event.
The Greek system offers. more

than 20 alternatives for the aver- .

age freshman to choose between,
and it is up to each house to find
the most attractive means to at-
tractjoe Freshman to their house.
Agreed, the rushee’s choice of
house depends on the quality of
the brotherhood, not the amount
of bikini-clad, muddy women,
but they must come out to make
that choice. Mock-tails just don't
cut it.

The OSA is trying to do what's
right, for whatever reasons, and

I'm sure Pat Robertson would ap- I

prove. However, their‘ reforms
must be left open to rational dis-
cussion between the OSA and
the student body so [that] these

continue to be around, unless
we, the student body, stand up

reforms can work for the good of
the Greek system and the student
body for all involved.

Tooting his own horn—-—-

We're writing in response to
Paul Dobransky’s letter alleged-
ly concerning residence hall
noise. It seems to us that Paul was
trying to do nothing more than
toot his own horn regarding’ his
academic success. Residence hall
noise is a problem for all stu-

dents, not just insecure chancel-v

lor's scholars. Paul's intellect is
not really necessary to the argu-
ment _nor is naming the specific
individuals involved. The naming

Poor guy. We have only two op-
tions left to battle finalitis.

I know from personal ex- .
perience how they cure appendi- »

citis. They go to the root of the

‘ problem and physically remove

it. By the way, they gave me mine
in a jar.

. Back to the topic. This would
be a great solution to this disease.
I'm talking on the scale of penicil-
lin’s discovery. But we all know
what the chances of getting finals

I _ removed are —- none and less.

The only other treatment can
be psychological. Now what is.
finalitis? It is the inflammation of
finals into an omnipotent career-
deciding terror’. And that's what
must be reduced for success and
peace of mind — the fear as-
sociated with finals’. We must see
them for what they truly are.

They are just regular tests, like
the ones we've been taking all
along. Don't worry about words
like ”cumulative” and ”essay.”
They're just scare tactics.

First of all, profs don't even

remember what material they

of individuals is both unprofes-
sional and slanderous.

We are quite certain that these
two students are not the only
[ones] to have ever caused the

ruckus. It also seems to us un- .

founded your belief that all mem-
bers of student organizations are
”immature” and ”uncultured.” I
guess you cannot be both social
and intellectual at the same time.
Your need for academic recogni-
tion indicates to us a need for a
new ”Academic Scoreboard”
section in The Pitt News. That
way, all your impressive scores
can be seen and admired by all.-
Won't Mom be proud.

say final is the best kind. You can
take a bare minimum of informa-
tion and elaborate on it for two
hours, while telling your profes-
sor how much you like your class
in between’ the brown stuff.
Finalitis can be devastating, not
only to one’s self-esteem but also,
and more importantly, to one’s
social life. It truly is a dread dis-
ease and must be watched for in
the next few weeks. Remember
the symptoms; And if the finali-

force without warning, just call
the finalitis hotline. The number
is: I-800-COTOBAR. Or visit the
finalitis rehab facility nearest you.

The ones nearest Oakland are:
St. Zelda's, Peter's Memorial of
Pittsburgh, General Ca|eco’s and
Sanctuary Hospital.

I also know that there is a tele-
vision campaign planned to com-
bat finalitis. It is a series of

Woman finds it too difficultto confide in herlover

Q. I am a 25-year-old woman
recently separated from a seven-
year relationship in which neither
of us. could be open about sexu-
al needs. Now I have a lover who
is loving, caring and open, but I
can't respond and tell him what
I want. I feel awkward about it.
The fact is, I have never reached
ecstasy without a vibrator, and I
feel sure I've missed out on
something wonderful. I want him
to bring me to ecstasy, but I can't
speak to him about my desire nor
about the vibrator. _ _

A. Many women who have
never had an orgasm except
through using a vibrator (which
can overcome all but the most
deep—seated resistance to orgasm)
have learned to reach their goal
without the vibrator. After bring-
ing themselves to the brink of or-

gasm with the vibrator, they
continue to pleasure themselves
without it. Later, feeling more
confidence in themselves, they
can reach climax without the
mechanical aid.

And what they learn by them-
selves they can teach to a lover,
either using words or wordlessly
guiding his hand. But all this self-
teaching will not bring you to
your goal of having him give you

the ultimate pleasure unless you V

learn to trust and confide in him.

I want you to ask yourself a
question. If you trust him‘ so inti-
mately with your body, why can't
you speak to him about your
secret desires?

Try this. Write a note to him
about your needs and about your
shyness in speaking of them. I
don't say to‘ mail him the note or

to hand itto him_or to leave it for
him,_but do write it. Form and re-
form the _words and sentences
that express just what you want
him to understand. Read the note
aloud to your mirror. Become

 

familiar with the words and
phrases.

Consider the possibility of giv-
ing this little set speech to him
sometime or, perhaps, letting him
read the note itself. After all, he
is sensitive, so he will understand
why you have to write instead of
speak. I think the moment will
come, and you will either speak
of your needsor give him the
note, opening up a most useful
dialogue with this open and lov-
ing partner.

Q. My parents are overseas,
and this lady next door who is 46
and alone began to visit me from

time to time. One thing /ed to

another. I am 19. This is my
problem —— she never gets
enough. We make love for three
hours, and she's just beginning,
but I am ready to hit the cold pil-

low for some sleep. What do I do .
when my parents get back?

A. I take it that the Marines, the
Peace Corps, college away from

home, none of that appeals to’

you — you intend to stay there
with your family. In that case, ,you

. should-ask this lady, "What hap-

pens when my folks get home?” A

She sounds like one who-looks
for good opportunities, makes the
most of them, then moves on.
You may be surprised. to find
that when your folks get home,
you are a dead duck with her.
She may be overdoing the sexu-
al demands so that when the end

comes, you will be glad to drop '

the affair without her having to be
cruel about it. In any case, your
parents will side with you against

this vampiress, so let things take. 

their natural course.

Another 15 weeks closer to "The Real  World"i

.Another semester has come
and gone. We're all 15 weeks
closer to having, to pay back our
student loans. Most of you fresh-
men are probably’ 15 pounds
heavier than you were when you
arrived. Another 15 weeks of‘
grueling all-nighters, cafeteria
food, sleeping through 8 am.

classes and hounding your land- _

‘lord to‘ fix the heat in your
apartment. A

That's 15 Thursday nights at
Zelda's Greenhouse, 15 weeks of
2 a.m. french fry feedings at the
"O" and, for those of us at The
‘Pitt News, 40 long production
nights spent putting together this

_ paragon of American journalism.

In.any event, we're 15 weeks
closer to becoming productive

.members of adult society, and

that's a scary thought. As college
students, we're living in a strange
microcosm that's just a little off-
kilter from the rest of the world.
For example, we don't measure
time in months-or years, but in
semesters. Thus, while Time
magazine annually presents "The
Year in Review,” we at The_Pitt
News are proud to present: "The

Semester in Review."

Violence in Oakland — Big,
scary people hitting youover the
head and stealing things from
you. Small, scary people hiding
under your bed waiting to jump
outat you and" stab you with an
icepick -— and huge -scary police-
dogs that frighten me more than
the gangs and teen-age rapists
(well, almost as much). ‘

Apartheid, divestment and

dead grass on the Union lawn — _
The trustees voted to continue '

"selective divestment." Mean-
while, thousands of blacks in
South Africa continued to die.
Students for a Free South Africa
and the Black Action Society ex-
pressed their outrage by erecting
two shanties outside t William

Pitt Union and vowing to inhabit"

them until Pitt agreed to divest.’
Alas, the hecklers, arsonists and
vandals seem to have impressed
upon the protesters that Oakland
already has enough substandard
housing. All of which led to a‘
rather strange twist in the plot.

TV takes over when

To me, the most intriguing mo-
ment of the World Series did not
take place on the playing field.
' The most intriguing moment of
the World Series took place just

-before the beginning of one of

the games in Boston. It was an-

' nounced that Bob Costas, NBC's

pregame host, had gone .to a
"Boston sports bar" and had in-

terviewed some of the people

there.

I was prepared to see another
of those videotape pieces where
the bartenders and patrons of a
sports-oriented bar whoop for the
cameras and shout out their love
for their home team.

But when Costas’ piece began
to roll, it immediately became
clear that this was something
different. '

For Costas was not in a real
Boston bar. He was on the set of
Cheers, the television series that
is supposed to take place in a real
Boston sports bar. All of the
show’s actors were there.

Costas played it straight. He in-
terviewed the"bartender,"' he got
reactionsfrom the "patrons,” he
joked with one of the "waitress-
es." NBC apparently considered
the piece to be a cute idea, and
I suppose it was. ‘ ‘

But that's. not whatmade itso  1

interesting. .

The interesting thing ‘was that
the by—play on the Cheers set felt
more real than if Costas had gone
to a genuine Boston bar. Because
Cheers is seen in millions of
American homes every week, the
pregame bit had a_ warmth and
familiarity that would have been
lacking in a real-Boston bar. J
5 The Cheers set is in Los An-
geles. All the filming is done

there. But it didn't matter; I sus-

pect that to viewers all over the
nation, the feature on the Los An-
geles Cheers set ‘seemed totally
authentic and -hometown-Boston.

And that is the important thing
to take away from this: Television
has become more real than real
life. If you show people some-
thing,with which they are familiar
from TV, it will seem genuine to
them. If you show them some-
thing that they don’t recognize

from TV — something real — it
will seem vaguely foreign and un-
settling; '

The Cheers bit on the pregame
show was a first — using a fiction-
al television setting to do a seem-
ingly nonfiction interview piece.
As I recall it, at no time during the

interview were the viewers told »

that they wereon the set of
Cheers. They were expected to

-just the way they did.

Allegedly, there is a bar in Bos-
ton that the TV Cheers bar was
modeled after. But if Costas and
his NBC crew had goneinto the
real bar, it would have felt no-
where as real as it did when they
went into the TV bar. That which
is real is no longer goodenough
to be real; the only things that
seem real are the false things on
television.

For most people Christmas
is an anticipated time of the
year. '

’But not for all. There are
some who will not be spend-
ing the holidays with their
family. They~ are not even
thinking about exchanging
presents and all the other
niceties that accompany such
a holiday. ‘

Right now there is a nine-
year—0ld boy named Hazrat in
Shadyside Hospital. He is from
Afghanistan. Two years ago
Hazrat’s home, which is about
40 miles north of the capital
Kabul, was bombed'by the
Russians. Hazrat saw his
mother die and his home torn
apart.

But he was lucky. Hazrat’s
uncle brought him to Pakistan
by donkey, where he was
stabilized at the Afghan Surgi-
cal Hospital. From there Haz-
rat came to the United States.
On the flight over, his heart
stopped; again he was lucky.
After first being treated in two
other hospitals, Hazrat was
brought to Shadyside, where

he is currently staying. Hazrat

had one leg amputated.

This year marks the seventh
year since the Soviet Union's
invasion of Afganistan. Ironi-
cally, the invasion began on
Christmas Eve, 1979. Since
this time thousands of people
have been executed and taken
as political prisoners.

More than one million peo-
ple have been killed, thou-
sands have been wounded
and thousands are missing.
Nearly one third of the popu-
lation have become refugees.
Some of the people fled to
neighboring Pakistan, others
to Iran, and others to more dis-
tant countries such as France.
Some have managed to come
to the United States.

Habib Zikria is from Af-
ghanistan. He was a political
Science professor. ”My
brother and my brother—in—|aw,
who were working for the
state department in Af_—
ghanistan, were taken
prisoner,” said Zikria. ”They
are still missing.”

Zikria currently lives in Fox
Chapel with another brother.
But he has not forgotten his
people. ’’I am trying to bring
help in Afghanistan,” said
Zikria. ”lnside Afghanistan

alone there are 2 million refu-
gees. If they move to Pakistan
or Iran we will lose the sup-
port we have inside.”

Zikria said that the Russians
try to push the farmers in the
villages to move to the big ci-
ties,- which are under com-
munist control. ”They destroy
their habitats by bombing,”
said Zikria.. ”They‘destroy
crops, livestock, all the facili-
ties the people have.”

Zikria is tryingto start a new
organization here in Pitts-

burgh; the American Hu-I

manitarian Support For Afghan
‘Tragedy. ”We hope that if we
can introduce this organiza-
tion inthe Pittsburgh area we
can -get help,” said Zikria.
”Things such as clothes, sleep-
ing bags, blankets, etc. Then
someone can take the supplies
over to the people in need.”
Zikria has already received
help from local people. Joyce
Janeway and her husband, Dr.
Timothy Janeway, have been
helping the Afghanistan peo-
ple for many years now.
”My husband and and I
went to Afghanistan for the
first time in 1972,” said Mrs.
Janeway. Since then the Jane-
ways have allied themselves

i     .   .
New organization seeks area support  

with the Afghan Surgical
Hospital. Through Dr. Jane-
way’s persuasion, Shadyside
Hospital is involved in a pro-
gram in which it gives free
treatment to Afghanistan refu-
gees. ”Now over 100 hospi-
tals are involved," said Mrs.
Janeway. '
”-When we have health care
in this country and people

who are able to help, then we _

owe it to these people, for hu-
manitarian reasons, to help,”
said Mrs. Janeway.

The Janeways have housed
six people who have been
treated at Shadyside. They are
also going to house Hazrat un-
til he is ready to return.

Mrs. Janeway is co-
chairman, along with Zikria, of
their new organization. ”We‘
hope, for support in Pitts-
burgh,” she said. ”We need to
find an apartment for people
who comehere for treatments.
When they are in rehabilita-
tion it's not right to keep them
in a bed/in the hospital.

”We are not militarily in-
volved,” she added. ”We are

not asking people to go and’

fight. We just want people to
be aware of the critical needs
of these people.”

Damick said on Thursday that
if the OSA spells out specifically
what is prohibited during rush,
the whole situation might be al-
leviated. ”We are not going to
push this thing,” Damick said.

If the OSA states that mud
wrestling is prohibited in the

”Policies Governing Fraternity‘

Rush,” then it might not be dis-
putable by the fraternities, -Da-
mick said.

”If we feel we have to redefine
it, we wil-l,” Giangarlo said. ”But
we won't do it on the basis of
this.”

Phi Gamma Delta, located on
Wallingford Avenue in north
Oakland, was accused of violat-

September — after they had con-
tacted the ACLU. a

Following a hearing, the«OSA

ma Delta President Bob Kramer,
Giangarlo stated that the fraterni-
ty had violated two policies in-
volving fraternity rush:

0 First, Phi Gamma Delta had

what the OSA called an unap-_

proved rush activity —— a tailgate
party prior to the Pitt-Maryland
football game in the Syria
Mosque parking lot.

0 Second, Phi Gamma Delta

‘violated non-alcohol rush by

”providing alcohol to any rushee
through any means at any time.”

According to the letter, the
fraternity is prohibited from serv-
ing alcohol at any activity host-
ed "by the chapter during the
1986 fall term, which ends Dec.
16.

Also, the chapter had to plan,
organize and present a program
on alcohol awareness as part of
the 1986 National Collegiate Al-
cohol Awareness Week in late

October, and each member of
the chapter- was fined $5.

The fraternity appealed the de-
cision but lost. According to
Bridget Guernsey, Greek adviser,
the sanctions will stand.

On Sunday, Oct. 26, Phi Gam— I

ma Delta presented a film on al-
cohol awareness in the Kurtzman
Room of the William Pitt Union.

Fiji brother Tony DeFiore still
disputes the sanctions. In a memo
DeFiore submitted to The Pitt
News in late October, he claims
that the fraternity was not able to
secure a copy of the original com-
plaint filed against it prior to the
original hearing. Giangarlo con-
firmed that Phi Gamma Delta
could not have a copy but said it
is a customary procedure to han-

dle it that way. She said any Phi -

Gamma Delta brother could have
read the complaint, taken notes
fromit or even copied it word for

police for more protection

By Teresa Candori
_Alssistan't News Editor

Residents of south Oakland,
concerned‘ with the growing
problem of crime and violence in
their neighborhood, discussed

-the possibility of initiating a block ,

watch program and petitioning
the Pittsburgh Police for more
protection.

”When you call the police
about something, they'll just
come, take a look and drive away
— if they do come at all," said Pat
Zeilinski of Lawn Street.‘

George Tees, another resident
of the area, said, ”Sometimes we
don't see a patrol car around here
for days at a time." ‘

Zeilinski referred to a particu-

lar trouble spot at the corner of .

Lawn and Ophelia streets as ”a
junkie heaven” _and said, ’’It
looks like they're not goingto do

Regina McDonald, community
relations officer from Pittsburgh
Police Station No. 4, explained to

the attendents of last night's meet- -

ing that the consolidation pro-
gram, which will go into effect on
Jan. 12, will increase the number
of patrol cars in south Oakland.
However, it will decrease the
number of policemen walking a
beat there.

”Since this is notla high—priority '

area, you probably won't be see-
ing any beat officers in this part
of the neighborhood,” McDon-
ald said. ”But there will be an in-
crease in one—man cars.”
According to McDonald, the
business areas along Forbes and
Fifth avenues and around Pitt are
considered high-priority, and
more beat officers are assigned t
those areas. _v

protecting —- Pitt students or the
taxpayers who live in this area?”
Tees called the consolidation
plan the police department's
”biggest mistake” and said that
having Station No. 4 in Oakland
acts as a deterrent.

”We’re going to have more
problems than ever when the sta-
tion moves up there [to Squirrel
Hill]," Tees. said.

McDonald advised the resi-
dents to call 911 rather than Sta-
tion No. 4 in the event ofian
emergency and to express their

concerns in’ a letter to Com- 

mander Joseph Windt. She also
distributed literature concerning
a neighborhood block watch pro-

residents can inform one another
of potential danger in the neigh-
borhood.

Scatterbrained?  
Having a dominant right brain hemisphere in a left-sided world  

if ‘A By Theresa Costello

Staff Writer

‘For many people in our world,
disorganization rules, sitting still
is almost impossible and no mat-
ter how intelligent they are, they
can do terribly on any standard

_ test. Why? Because they are right-

brain dominant in a left—brain
dominant world.

This is according to LaDonna
Bates, a counselor at the Shady-
side Center for Human Develop-
ment. Bates, who feels that she,

  0

too, is right—hemisphere domi-

nant, graduated valedictorian
from her high school but at the
same time, scored much lower
than many of her counterparts on
standardized tests.

”Right—brain dominant people
are creative, cluttering, impul-
sive, intuitive and enthusiastic.
Left-brain dominant are orderly,
neat, logical and rational,” said
Bates.

This is why many right—brain
dominant people ”feel out of step
all throughout their lives.”'

For a right—brain'person to sit
still with his feet on the ground
and in total silence is almost im-
possible and to learn that way is
even more difficult.

Another difference is that right-
brain dominant people ”must see
the whole of something before
the parts make sense,” said Bates.
”We can see an answer for a
math problem without seeing the
steps needed to reach_ the
answer.”.

People who are right—side
dominant, also called alternators

hemisphere, are in good compa-
ny, though. Albert Einstein was
thought to be retarded by his ear-
ly schoolteachers because it took
him so long to learn how to both
speak and read.

Not all alternators are totally
out of step with the left—brain
world, however. Many, like Lin-
da Steward who is a pre—med col-
lege graduate and a registered
nurse, are living successful lives.
Steward wanted to improve her
study habits, so she joined up

Steward is what is called a
hepatic learner 4 able to use
both sides of the brain almost
equally. She worked with Bates
to ”develop skills and improve
[her] education and efficiency.”

Steward claimed, ’’If I do some-
thing physical while studying, my
recall is better, and I need to use
less time to study.”

While studying, Steward often
paces and recites. To improve her
concentration, she takes her
notes on green paper and covers
whatever she is reading with a
yellow or blue transparency.

These are examples of methods
that Bates advocates. Many alter-

, nators have learned that if they

read while lying down or while
in a physical activity they can not
only recall more, but their read-
ing level can increase from the
second—grade to post-col|e‘ge
level.

Another method that has found
favor among many ‘alternators
and right—side dominant people is
the use of music.

Steward and Gina Stanford, a
Pitt sophomore, both use music
to study and take tests. For many
alternators, the silence during a
test or in studying makes it
difficult to concentrate or think.

One of the main focuses of
Bates’-techniques is to improve
the self-esteem of alternators.

They are often labeled everything '

from day-dreamers to retarded.
Since this starts at a very early
age, the person often develops a
lack of confidence.

To improve their self—esteem,

* Bates teaches techniques which

enable the alternator or hepatic
learner to use his right—brain
capabilities to his advantage.
Bates believes that all humans
access both hemispheres of the

' mind, but the differences lie in

which one is dominant and the
ability of the mind to transfer in-
formation from one side to the
other; .

To pass information requires
impulses to go through the cor-
pus callosum. Physical activity
stimulates this transfer, and that
is why so many alternators find

such success in activity. In fact,

one of Bates’ students reads while
on the trampoline and while
jumping rope. '

. Although not everyone in _the
medical and psychological fields
agree, Bates has found strong

support for her ideas. Barbara Vi-.

tale, author of Unicorns Are Real:
A Right—Brained Approach to
Learning and Free Flight:
Celebrating Your Right Brain, is
one of her most vocal advocates.

Both women believe that
teachers have a role to play in
helping those who are right—brain
dominant. Bates suggests that the
teacher should allow the students
some movement and should also
introduce the main idea of each
lesson before going on to the in-
dividual pieces of it. '

...n.«.au—- -yo . .~

By Douglas W. Payne

Imagine the Faustian legend in which the
protagonist makes a pact with the devil and
sells his soul. Now imagine that a nerdy,
little guy sacrifices his morality to feed his
best friend, a plant, in order to make all his
dreams come true (especially _the one with
a girl in it). Now put it all to some catchy
music and you have the love story of a boy
and a girl and the plant that brought them’
together. But, there's a price to be paid,
and the plant needs to be fed. But how? Or
who? Who will feed the plant and, more
importantly, who will be fed to the plant?

litt/e Shop of Horrors, a film musical

. directed by Frank Oz and starring Rick

Moranis and Ellen Greene, is where allthe
demonic action occurs. .

Butthere's more. There's the sinister sadist
whose hobbies include motorcycling and
dentistry. Played by Steve Martin with furi-
ous brilliance, this character is called "the
leader of the plaque." -

There's Weird Wink Wilkenson (played

«by John Candy), a wacko disc (ockey

who's weirder than the wacky guests he
features on his radio show. And iust so you
don't lose your place, three dreamgirls
named Crystal, Chiffon and Ronette narrate
the whole thing in three-part harmony.
Mr. I\/lushnik (Vincent Gardenia) laments
that business at his flower shop on skid row
is not so good; in fact, no one at the shop
can rememberthe last time Mushnik had a
customer. One of Mushnik’s employees,
Seymour -Krelborn (played by Moranis),

who is nursing a crush on his co—worker

Audrey (Ellen Green) is coaxed to put his
unusual pet plant, Audrey ll, in the shop's
window to attract business. The play is suc-
cessful, and business booms." But Audrey ll
wilts. What will Seymour do? Audrey ll
doesn't need sunshine, water, affection or

“A Venus Tourist Trap

fertilizer. Seymour discovers that Audrey ll
thrives on human blood. So, Audrey ll
grows bigger while Seymour grows ane-
mic. Business at Mushnik’s is booming, and
Audrey ll is busting out all over, but what
is Seymour goingto do? The plant wants
some real plant food now. .

Rick Moranis knows Seymour well. His
riveting portrayals of Woody Allen, Perry
Como and Dick Cavett on SCTV were
balanced out with nerds like his world-
famous Bob McKenzie and a nebbish style
which endeared him to millions. As Sigour—
ney Weaver's neighbor in Ghostbustérs, he
translated his unique charm to the big
screen.

"l've always wanted to do a musical,"
Moranis claims.’ "On SCTV, I did a lot of
musical stuff, but it was always‘ either an im-
pression or a parody of how bad some-
body was."

Seymour Krelborn offered Moranis the
opportunity to "sing straight," as he puts
it, or rather, do a straight role in a musical

comedy. Although he lacks stage ’ex-,

perience, he radiates natural charm. Mora-

nis brings such a ‘sweet affability to Seymour .

that it's difficult to dislike such an innocent
and utterly likeable guy, even though he is
the hero of little Shop of Horrors.

In person, Moranis is far more outgoing
and self—assured than Seymour but no less
delightful. Yet, when one considers his past
in television and film, it is difficult to think of
anyone else but Moranis playing the part
of Seymour. _
“ "David Geffen [the film's producer] had

wanted me to do it for years," Moranis as- '

serted, "even before Frank [02] was in-
volved. That's how I've gotten any role that
l've ever had; somebody's iust called me
up. Any time I go for an audition, I never
get it." -

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, December 5, I986

By George Esper
AP Writer

PHILADELPHIA — When her
20-year-old daughter was
found stabbed to death in a
I\/lanhattan hotel room eight
years ago — apparently by her
lover, punk rock star Sid Vicious
— Deborah Spungen thought
the only way to end her own
pain was to kill herself.

Instead, in time, she trans-
formed her grief into the ther-
apeutic drive to help other
parents of murder victims.

Last‘ January, Deborah
opened a victim advocacy office
as an offshoot of Parents of i\/lur-
dered Children, providing volun-
teers to go into court with
families to comfort them, keep
them posted on proceedings
and help them with other
problems. .

And this fall, at age 49, she is
back in school, studying at Bryn
lvlawr College for master's

' ' degrees in social work and in so-

cial policy law, with plans to one
day help shape legislation and
lobby for families of murder
victims.

Recently Spungen said her
pair over Nancy's death was
revived with the release of Sid &
Nancy. ,

punk group named the Sex

Pistols, was charged with the
Oct. I2, I978 murder but died
four months later of a heroin
overdose.

Spungen, who wrote a book
about life with her daughter,
Ana’ / Don't Want To live This
Life, published in I983, has no
plans to see the movie.

”What's extremely upsetting
is people are congratulating me
that I sold my book as a movie.
It's not my movie. We voted as
a familynot to sell the movie be-
cause we would have little con-
trol. But nobody in the business
said to us, ’If you don't sell your
movie, somebody else is going

to make it.’ I would have sold it

under those circumstances,”
said Spungen.

’’I cannot even begin to de-
scribe how it hurts.  Leave her
alone, and leave us alone.
They're only doing it to sensa-
tionalize,” Spungen said.

Lori Long, a spokeswoman for
the Samuel Goldwyn Company,

, the film's distributor, said the fo-

cus of the movie was the deep
love between Sid and Nancy.
Over the years, Spungen has
solved her pain with the reward
of helping other parents.

Courtroom 675, seeking out
families of victims to offer as-
sistance to at preliminary
hearings.

Recently, a mother whose
7-year-old son had been killed
embraced one of the volunteers,
Joan Sabia, who had sat with
her at the hearing and then
offered to help arrange psycho-
logical counseling for a daugh-
ter, which is one of the referral
services of the advocacy office.

"When I saw her reach out
and put her arms around Joan —
and I've had that happen to me
— I get the chills," said Spun-
gen. ”When I see I can make a
difference and change some-
one's pain a little bit, that helps
me."

Spungen opened the victim
advocacy office with an initial
city council grant of SI 0,500, a
cubicle and a telephone in the
district attorney's office, a sala-
ried program director, Melissa
Frost, and about 20 volunteers.
Recently the project received an
additional $9,400.-

Frost said the advocacy office
was involved with more than
I50 cases, from going into court
with families to helping them fill
out crime victims’ compensation
forms that help pay for burial.

little Shop of Horrors finally
gives Moranis the room toilet his
talents (pardon the pun) flower.
Moranis doesn't seem to be
concerned with being typecast
as the typical nerd, though. His
-range is considerable and his
talents lend a certain personal
touch within his work, which
never fails to endear his au-
dience. Seymour Krelborn is at
the heart of little Shop, and it's

.a heart that beats with love.

To the uninitiated, though, this i

must sound utterly mad, so a
brief history lesson is necessary.

' ln i960, Roger Corman direct-

ed the lowest.of the low-budget,
cult classics, little Shop of Hor-
rors. Filmed in only two days,
the trashy flick is notorious for a
hilarious walk-on performance
by a little-known actor named
Jack Nicholson as a masochis-
tic patient who longed for pain-
ful bridgework without Novo-
cain. ln the new film, Bill Murray
assumes this role with his own
trademark insanity.
Twenty~two years later, lyricist
Howard Ashman and composer
Alan Menken brought their own

musical adaptation to the off-

large audiences. Oz, a Muppet
creator and performer, took on
the challenging role of directing
the film version of the stage

Armed with Ashman's screen-
play, Oz faced the task of creat-

comedies," he claimed. ''I want
movies that have areas of ex-
citement and areas of of-
fection."

Here's a man who directs a
film with humanity and love, and
gets you to -laugh along with
him. "l'm really tired of special
effects," he said with a mature

-simplicity. "lf you knew that

[Audrey ll] was springs, cables
and remotes, or whatever else,
you only see it as special effects
and not as a cha_racter, not a
personality. I want Seymour to
touch the plant, l don't want him
to pretend to touch the plant."

Oz brings a great deal of love
to this picture. The colorful skid
row shots (filmed on the im-
mense Pinewood lot in London
where the James Bond films are
made) have the technicolor feel
of those great old musicals like
South Pacific or West Side Sto-
ry. Oz also includes a marvelous,
fantasy sequence in which
Audrey‘ fantasizes (in the song
"Somewhere That's Green")
about her Better Homes and
Gardens future. State-of—the—art
chromium appliances and
plastic-covered furniture abound
in her crackerbox pal-ace. Her
children look just like daddy and
mommy, and everyone smiles
like there's no tomorrow.

It's a heartwarmingly silly
scene of which Oz is especially
fond. "l found it funny, and I
wanted it to be affectionate,”

. he said of the brightly colored

dreamworld Audrey inhabits.
"But it was effective on stage
before l did the visuals because
Howard Ashman's lyrics are
brilliant." ‘

Oz has created something of
a cinematic gem in litt/e Shop of
Horrors. lt's eminently entertain-
ing,‘ constantly intriguing, filled
with good, clean laughs and
sometimes even'a little scary.
"Frank is the nicest guy," assert-
ed Moranis. "He's his own
worst enemy; he's meticulous,
dedicated, and he's worked
very hard to make the tone [of
the film] consistent. I think film-
maker's will see this, and other
people will wonder why this is
so good. I think he's going to be
a major director. He's really
wonderful, patient and suppor-
tive, but he'll never say it. He'll
take no credit, but he deserves
all of the credit. A brilliant guy."

If you think that's ecstatic
praise, then you're right. Oz
deserves a‘ good deal of credit
for successfully creating what

Alfred Hitchcock called "pure

cinema" in [itt/e Shop of Hor-
rors. And this is seemingly his first
foray outside of the children's
world of muppets and gelfings.

But what does he think?

''I don't think about a younger
audience," he claimed with
pride. "We're adults; we do it
for ourselves. That which ap-
peals tokids like simple syntax
and color action, also appeals
to adults. I don't know what the
hell kids want. I don't even know
what kids are." '.

Somehow you tend to dis-

believe a statement like that from - ~

a man who puts childlike vigor
into his adult visions. This is the
man who points to his heart and
tells you that "the mind is not
that smart, this is."

So what's next for O2? "A
deep, dark, psychological dra-

'ma with profanity and sex."

DIARY FOR
MY CHILDRE

MARTA MESZAROS

Guitarist Robert Holmes

’TiI Tuesday's resilient

By John Young

It isn't easy being part of a

. band whose image seems to be 

defined by one single member of
the group. But this is the situation
in which 'Til Tuesday's guitarist
Robert Holmes finds himself
while playing alongside the strik-
ing, oft—pictured Aimee Mann.

"We had done everything,
struggling together as four peo-
ple, all loading station wagons
up with equipment and doing
everything together — being
poor together, paying equal
amounts of everything," Holmes
said in an interview at Graffiti
_last Saturday. "And then, all of
a sudden, when it takes off,
there was suddenly a very clear
line between Aimee and the
band. You'd be in situations
where you'd go back to meet
somebody or other and they
would get Aimeea drink, and
the three of us [Holmes, drum-
mer Michael Hausman and key-
boardist Joey Pesce] would be
standing there tvviddling our
thumbs."

Holmes feels the attention
given the. band's lead singer/
bassist can be attributed large-
ly to the success of the video that
accompanied the band's break-
through hit "Voices Carry."

"When ’Voices Carry’ was
right up in the Top l O, anywhere
in the country that we went,
people recognized Aimee. 
That's the power of video.
They're not recognizing us be-
cause they heard the song on
the radio [and] went out and
bought the single," said
Holmes. '

Yet for all the success the
"Voices Carry" video helped
the‘ band achieve, Holmes
shows no great concern for, or
liking of, the medium.

On making videos Holmes
said, '’It's basically the profit
that you made from your record
being spent, and you're just
watching it go away." Holmes
seems particularly wary of the
whole process getting beyond
the band's means as well: "You

there, and you're thinking,
'Why do we have a Winneba-
go on the set? it's probably cost-
ing us a couple hundred dollars
a day.’  it's not a relaxing sit-
uaﬁon/'

lt is perhaps surprising that
there aren't more things 'Til
Tuesday's youn , orange-
locked guitarist fincfs a bit over-

_ whelming at times. In iustovera

year, his band went from being
a relatively successful member of
what Holmes calls an "extreme—
ly ' supportive" Boston music
scene, to a‘ nationally-

‘recognized group, thanks in

large part to winning a l984
"rock 'n' roll rumble" among 25
bands sponsored by Boston ra-

dio station WBCN. While suc-

cess did not come overnight with

the ascent of "Voices Carry" up .

the Bi//board charts, it did come
in large quantities.

Yet Holmes feels the band felt
no particular pressure when,
earlier this year, they returned to
the studio to record the follow-
up to theirdebut album: "The
label was extremely supportive
and said, 'Just take your time,
and do whatever‘ it takes; we
believe in you guys.' "

Mann had been writing songs
on acoustic guitar while the
band toured, and afterward,
she, Holmes and Pesce all
worked on material on their own
four-track recorders. The group
then entered the studio with
Rhett Davies, noted for his work
with Roxy Music, Brian Eno and
recently lcehouse, as producer.
Holmes considers the producer's
role an important one, one that
was played. well by Davies
while working on We/come
Home.

"|t was like having a really,
really qualified father figure and
musician and friend and diplo-
mat all in one," Holmes said.
Yet Holmes feels the band is still
ultimatelyresponsible for how a
record sounds. "There was a
review written recently where
they talked about heavy guitar
treatments being part of the ar-
rangements [on We/come
/"/ome]‘and giving Rhett credit

for it. But actually I used all my
effects in the studio, and I would
just try something, and he'd say,
'Yeh, yeh, yeh, that sounds
great,’ and so I would follow it
through. It's not like he goes in
there and says, 'OK, now l wan-
nafhave a heavily flanged gui-
tar doing this part.'  We
sounded pretty much like this
record when we were playing in
rehearsal."

Holmes is justifiably proud of
his guitar workfor 'Til Tuesday;
it is vital to the band's entranc-
ing, carefully-textured songs.

"| play guitar more like ’a
listener than I do like a player.
So when I'm playing things,
what l've done is l've heard a
melody line in my head or a part
that l really want to hear [and I
play that]. It really isn't about
chops so much as it is about
melody." .

The group's well-developed
melodic sensibility was apparent

throughout their Pittsburgh per-

formance. Songs like "On Sun-

‘I3

I team player ,

day" and ’’Love in A Vacuum"
were enrapturing as Holmes’

and Pesce's backing vocal lines '

played off Mann's warm,
evocative singing, and instru-
ments built expertly on each
other to create sweeping,‘ tra ns_-

porting moments in both songs’

choruses. . -

Certainly to Robert Holmes,
making such memorablemusic is
what playing is all about. Dur-
ing the group's encore, Holmes
began strumming quietly be-
tween songs. After he declined
a ioking invitation by Mann to
do a solo piece, she walked
toward him and smiled, "Robert
is a team player."

''If you really start to analyze
it, I don't really have any interest
in being on camera for X percen-
tage of the video and that kind
of stuff. I'm here to play the mus-
ic," Holmes said later. And the
music _he's helping to make as an
equal partner in 'Til Tuesday is
some of the best crafted and
most lasting being _ played
today. ‘

By David Zuchowski

Faust, the epic legend of the
aging philosopherwho sells his
soul to the devil in an attempt to
regain his lost youth, will be
staged by the Pittsburgh Opera
on Dec. 4, 6 and 9 at Heinz
Hall. Baritone Frederick Burchi-
nal will sing the part of Valentin,
a role he first performed more
than l0 years ago and one that
he has repeated many times
since. Last seen here with the
Pittsburgh Opera in l985 as
lvlichonnet in Adriannna
lecouvreur, Burchinal will be
making only his second Pitts-
burgh appearance. l inter-
viewed Burchinal at his Chicago
home by telephone on Nov. 5.

D.Z.; The Faust legend has lent
itself to many literary and artis-
tic creations. ln England,
l\/larlowe's Dr. Faustus comes to
mind. Germany can claim
Goethe's Faust. And, of course,
France has Gounod's opera
Faust. How can you explain the
appeal of this interesting
legend?

F.B.: Well, man, being what
he is, seems to want things that
he can't or doesn't have. One
of these things is youth, so en-
vied by a lot of older folks. The
desire for youth was the hook
that got Faust in league with the
devil. Personally, I feel that we
as people pretty much have to
accept who and what we are at

. the moment. Faust couldn't or

wouldn't do that. And so he will-
ingly bargained away his soul to
regain his youth.

D.Z.: With all the operas
you've performed in your illustri-
ous career, do you have a
favorite role?

F.B.: l just yesterday complet-

 THE Pm NEWS, Friday, December 5, 1986

Burchinal and the Pittsburgh
Opera revive the legend of Faust

ed a run with the Knoxville
Opera in which I played the part
of Rigoletto, one of myafavorite
roles. To that l’d have to add the
roles of logo and Macbeth.

D.Z.: l have an image of the
opera singer as being very
glamorous and exciting. But
what is really involved in getting
estab- lished in the first place?
What's involved in the road to
stardom?

F.B.: First of all, having a good
teacher is very important. A
good teacher, to me, is one that
establishes the right attitude in
their pupils. That, in addition to
learning the basic vocal tech-
nique, is so important toan oper-
atic career. _ '

Then, too, you have to have
a pretty strong physical consti-
tution and mental stamina. A
young singer has to endure the
ups and downs of auditioning
and of coping with the uncer-
tainty of employment. They're
constantly worried about where
and when their next iob will be
forthcoming. .

There's a lot of doubt as to
whether they've sung Well
enough for a particular opera
company to be rehired for a fu-
ture engagement. Over the
years, |'ve seen my own circle
of colleagues, most of whom
'were devoted, dedicated artists,
grow smaller and smaller until
there's only a handful left
who've been lucky enough to
have a long-term" career. "A
young singer, even an estab-
lished one, has to spend long
hours practicing and learning
new material. Somewhere in my
brain, for instance, are over 60
operas that, at some point in my
life, l've had to learn and
memorize.

The Rescue". t

D.Z.: To change the subiect a
bit, what about your voice? Do
you have to take any special
precautions to protect it?

F.B.: Well, traveling around as
much as we do,'we expose our-
selves quite a bit to different cli-
mates, environments, pollens
and dust. So we have to be con-
scious of protecting our instru-
ments as much as possible. lt's
not that we wear scarves in
90-degree weather for fear of
catching cold. But I think that if
you take care of yourself, you
don't have to be paranoid
about getting sick. ln fact, l'm
about to go to the health club af-
ter I speak to you and go
through my usual weight—lifting
and swimming routine. I try to
keep in shape as much as possi-
ble, for the demands of singing
on stage for three hours are pret-
ty much equal to the demands of
being in a marathon. Much of
our audience doesn't see us as
we do —— as athletes that try to
maintain a dietary and physical
regimen. _lf you don't keep your
body in shape,
produce. lt's as simple as that!

D.Z.: What about smoking
and drinking? \

F.B.: l don't smoke at all. As
for alcohol, l may have an oc-
casional glass of wine with din-
ner. Both are_bad habits that
tend to dry out the vocal cords
to such an extent that you have
to work much harder on stage
than you normally would.

D.Z.: I see you being feted a
lot at parties, restaurants, etc.

and being tempted by cocktails g

and wines served there. Am l
right? .

F.B.: To some degree. But
there's_always soda water.

D.Z.:Do opera singers peak
at a certain age, and how long
can their careers expect to last,
on the average?

F.B.: I_ don't know if there's
such a thing as peaking. We
mature and through the years,
we learn a variety of skills. As

we mature, we move on to a .

more demanding and more
difficult repertoire. We try to
keep improving our skills as we
grow older. -
With a good vocal technique,
theiproper diet and an exercise
program, there's no reason why
we can't still be singing in our
505. And some of usperform

_ through our 605. Giuseppe Tad— .
dei made his Met debut just last

year at the ripe age of 70 and
in the title role of Fa/staff to boot!
D.~Z.: What would you recom-

mend to the aspiring singers right -

here in Pittsburgh? . -

F.B.: l’d tell them not to be
overly idealistic. They should
realize that an opera career in-
volves a lot of hard work.There
are rewards along the way
along with the hardships and
difficulties. Very few of us attain
the superstardom of a Pavarotti
or a Domingo. l’d also tell them
to learn how to do other things
besides singing to make a living,
iust to have something else to fall
back on.‘

BOUNCING OFF THE
SATELLITES

The B-52s

Warner Bros.

By Brenda McGuirk

They may not be better than
ever, but The B-52$ are back
with the new album Bouncing
Off the Sate//ites. The newest
release is the band's fifth album,
and while it is different from their

- past efforts, it is no disap-

pointment.

The album doesn't have as’

much party music on it as The
B-52s does. The songs ”Juicy
Jungle" and ”Communicate"
have messages about saving
trees and talking out problems

. instead of bottling them up.

”Ain’t That a Shame" has a
country sound to it. ”She Brakes

For Rainbows” and ”Summer of V

Love” sound more like Top-40
songs than B-52s tunes. Belinda

Carlisle could have released
either one of them. ”Theme For
a Nude Beach” is slower than
past songs and sounds like ”Le-
gal Tender" off Whammy. Both
are danceable but not very
lumpy-

This album is morecomplex
and blended than the band's
previous albums. The instruments
are not as distinctive as they are
on The B-.525. On ”Cake"_and
the now classic "Rock Lobster,"
the guitar, organ, drums and vo-
cals are basic and sound

separate from each other._

Sometimes the music sounds like
something from ”Star Trek." The

songs on the latest album are
more blended and harmonious. ‘

The sharp, punchy beat and
danceability of the tunes from
the past are missing from some
of the songs. The '60s flavor The
B-52$ possessed in earlier al-
bums is fading away.

Ricky Wilson, bass guitar

player, died of cancer'before_.

' the album was released but he

did participate in the recording
of the songs. His music gave The
B-52s a distinct sound that still
exists in a few of this album's
songs. . '
Fred Schneider appears on
only four out of the lO songs of
the album. Two years ago, he
formed Fred Schneider and The
Shake Society while The B-52s
were idle. Schneider's best con-
tribution to the album is his vo-
cals on ”Detour Through Your
Mind.” His voice brings back
the old B-52s sound and the
words to the song are charac-
teristic of the band's lyrics. It
seems that Dr. Aron Butter-
f/y/Wants to dip us in p/aster
and use us for book ends/We
say to the doctor ”No, please
no! ”/And then we get the doc-
tor bi///What a shoc/<.//
$16,000!/And a// he wanted to
do was dip us in plaster!
Schneider's absence allows
vocalists Cindy Wilson and Kate

Pierson to emerge from being
background vocalists to becom-
ing lead singers. Both have in-
credibly versatile voices. On
”Rock Lobster” they shrieked,
screamed and made. animal
noises. On the new ’’Girl From .
lpanema Goes to Greenland,"
Cindy Wilson's voice soars
through some very high notes
with great clarity. When the
women sing together, it sounds
like five people instead of two.
Their voices are important in
creating the B-52s sound.

There are. some songs that
could fit the old B-52s style.
”Wig,” ”Hous_ework" and.
”Girl From lpanema Goes to
Greenland" keep the old feeling
that drew me to the band in the
first place. The other songs just
slow the pace down but don't
quite stop it.

The changes on this album
work. There is still-no danger of
The B-52$ singles becoming

.Top—4O hits.’

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, December 5, I986

continued from page 75

‘ Jett’s newest album, so disap-

pointing. l am just not hearing

. what I used to.

Joan Jett and The Blackhearts
used to be a band that pro-
duced music that was fun to
listen to. Her first two albums
were popular and contained a
lot of catchy tunes. On this al-
bum, none of the songs are in-

' stantly likeable and most are

plain boring. Something has
happened to Ms. Jett, and I am
not sure what it is.

Her judgment seems to have

, gone awry, along with her inno-

cence. ”Good Music,” the title

' track of the album, has a play-

ing time of 5:45, which is about
three minutes too long. The song
is moderately cute but becomes
unbearable as it drags on. She
tries to sing a rap song called
"Black Leather" which is, to put

it bluntly, horrible. lt is torture to
hear a pop singer without much
conviction tackle a song that re-
quires toughness. Her choice of
remakes is abhorrent. She
covers The Beach. Boys’ "Fun,
Fun, Fun," which is exactly what
this album isn't. The song seems
unnecessary and contains none
of the energy that David Lee

Roth's ”California Girls" did. ~

_Jett also tackles Jimi Hendrix's
”You Got Me Floatin' " which
is simply monotonous and an-
ynoying.

The only songs worth noting
on the album are ”Just Lust” and
”ThisMeans War,” which are
somewhat reminiscent of the old
Joan.Jett. They still lack much of
the ower of her earlier works,
but or this album, they stand out
among a rather poor collection
of tunes.

Jett sings I need good music/

the district attorney's homicide
unit, said the advocacy office
has proved invaluable tohis staff
of fewer than 20 who sometimes
cannot spare the time to explain,
for example, why it takes six to
nine months for a case to come
to trial.

”l think it's a real good thing,"
he said. ”Right now we have
280 active homicide cases
awaiting trial. Our main concern
is convictions. Sometimes we are
not able to give the support and
care needed to help [victims’
families] get through the horrible
experience. lt's hard for people
to understand why the delays.
The Parents of Murdered Chil-

, dren have really helped in trying I

to explain the vagaries of the
system.”

Some people helped by the
volunteers have become volun-
teers themselves, like Blanche
Johnson, whose 29-year-old
daughter was killed as police
tried’. to rescue her from a kid-
napper. ‘Johnson remembers
Frost accompanying her to
court. ’ I

”lt's hard to describe your
feelings knowing someone else
is there, someone who under-
stands, someone sort of explain-
ing things," Johnson said. She
now calls up to 20 people a
week to let them know they are
not alone.

Spungen said her nightmare
with Nancy began years before
her death. .

Nancy threw violent tantrums
and mistreated [her parents, sis-
ter and brother, Spungen said.
She shouted obscenities at her
parents and once hit her mother
with a hammer. I -

She was sent to a mental in-
stitution at age I l.‘ By lo, she
was a drug addict. Later, she
worked in Times Square bars as
a topless go—go dancer.

She blames Nancy's traumat-
ic birth for her destructive be-
havior. She was born cyanotic,
a so-called blue baby deprived
of oxygen because her umbilical
cord had wrapped around her

neck. A separate blood problem ‘

required a series of transfusions.-
Her first drug dose was pheno-
barbital at age 3 months, given
to stop her screaming for hours
in the middle of the night.

In herbook, Spungen writes
that no one will ever know what

9.‘-

‘is,

happened the night Nancy
died. But, she said, based on a
letter she received from Vicious
and the police disclosure that
Nancy had bought the knife that
killed her, "lt is my belief that
she engineered her death.”
”She wanted to die — had for
years;” Spungen wrote. ”So

THE PITI NEWS

Lights out

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer ‘

It wasn't much of a struggle,
but then again, nobody expected
one. '

The Pitt Panther basketball
team, led by Curtis Aiken’s mag-
ical 32 points, strolled away from

4,}, the St. Francis Red Flash in Wed-—
’ ' nesday night's 108-69 defeat at

the Maurice Stokes Building.

In their second warm-up con-
» test of the year, "the Panthers
ripped out to an early 23-8 lead.

’’I think our kids are confident
at this point,” said Panther coach
Paul Evans. ”We needed a game
like this to iron some things out.
I'm pretty satisfied with where we

(.5; are now.” "

ﬁr

By all means, this contest be—,

longed to Aiken. Pitt's prototype

shooting guard bombed the Red _

Flash defense from the perimeter,
including four direct hits for three
points each. Said Aiken after the
game, ”I’m really confident.with
my game, especially with my
shot. My selection has also im-
proved. I was open a bit more

' than usual tonight, with Charles

[Smith] setting some real good
picks.  I just felt it. I could tell
I was on.”

”He [Aiken] was no doubt the
best player on the court tonight,”
said St. Francis coach Kevin Por-
ter. ”We knew he was the key to
their offense. He hit those same
shots last year, but they only
counted for two.” "

’’It was nice to see Curtis get off
to a good start,” said Evans. ”He
usually misses his first three or
four shots‘ before he gets going.
But he has the greenlight to put
it up. If he feels comfortable, he
can back up and take the three-
pointer.” '

Another Panther who per-
formed admirably was reserve
center Tico Cooper. Cooper, sub-

I Now,‘ it's time to play some
ball.

The confidence-builders (if you
want to call them that) against In-
diana University of Pennsylvania
and St. Francis are behind this
talent-laden Pitt Panther basket-
ball team (ranked 11 by UPI and
12 by AP).

Tomorrow night at 8 at Fitzger-
ald Field House against Illinois
(14 UPI and 9 AP), the Panthers
get their first opportunity to play
a team that is on theirlevel.

.”We’II definitely be ready for
Illinois,’’ said Pitt smallforward
Demetreus Gore.‘ ' I

Panther coach Paul Evans can't

wait, either. ”We» need a game

:9; ;é"¢_‘9-.-v.-I-

; like this _to_see’ how the  gyvi II.-

   

 

who was sidelined with a sore
toe, earned 18 points and pulled

- down eight rebounds in his 27

minutes of action.

”That was the best I've seen
Tico play since I've been here,”
remarked Evans. ”He hasn't
worked with our_ fi'rst—team
offense much in practice, so he
sometimes messes up some of the
finer points of the game. But I was
happy with what he did.”

”If I'm needed, I'll be there,”
Cooper explained. ”I’m glad I
could help the team. I feel com-
fortable on the court playing with
the rest of the guys.”

Point guard Mike Goodson had
a steady performance, dishing out
seven assists while scoring 10
points. Swingman Demetreus
Gore tossed in 20, including a
reverse break-away dunk. .

”Gore is a great open court
player,” said Porter. ”He’s a
tremendous athlete — the second
best shooter on their team.”

Defensively, the Panthers were
also dominating, holding the Red

- Flash to 43 percent shooting from

the field and out—rebounding the
host team by 20. SophomoreJer—
ome Lane snared 13 boards while
freshman Rod Brookin had 10 re-
bounds

.‘”Rod only scored four points,
but his rebounding was a big sur-
prise for us,” said Evans. ”I’m
happy with his progress.”

Porter couldn't be too. happy

about his club's performance, but .

he was obviously impressed with
his opponent.

”They [Pitt] are a Completely
different team this year. You can
see it — the way they move on
the court,” said Porter. ”They’re
just so much more disciplined.
Their top seven/players are the
best in the country.”

Enough with the little schools.
Bring on the country.

Illini, Pi

react against a good ball cIub,” '

said Evans. ”The kids need to
realize that they can do some of
the same things against Illinois
that they did against St. Francis
and IUP and still have success.”

Hopefully, for Pitt's sake, those
good things will be able to pro-
duce a victory against the Illini,
but it won't be easy. ‘

Illinois was 2-0 going into last ‘

night's home game against'Chica-
go State. They defeated New
Mexico State 67-65 and Duke
69-62 last week to win the BYU-
Hawaii Tournament.

The Illini are led by 6-8 senior
forward All-America candidate
Ken Norman,_who averaged 24
points per game through the first

3 ‘two games this year.

The two biggest changes in col-
lege basketball for the 1986-87
season will undoubtedly be
Proposition 48 and the three-
point rule.

Proposition 48, the academic
guidelines for collegiate freshman
scholarship athletes, is probably
a step in the right direction, but
it is most certainly not without its
shortcomings.

The rule in effect says that an
incoming freshman must have a
2.0 grade point average in 11
basic core courses and a score of
700 on the SAT (or 15 on the
ACT). If a student fails to meet this
requirement, he must sit out or
lose one year of eligibility.
Although, if the student were to
pay his own tuition for the first
year, he could keep the four years
of eligibility. Also, if the student
isn't eligible athletically, then he
cannot practice with the team.

First of all, even though 700
doesn't seem like a very high
score, many students have gone
to college in the past, have gradu-

o ated and are doing very well to-

day without ever obtaining a 700
score on the SAT. It is a proven
fact that SATs are geared toward
the middle to upper middle class
and that low socioeconomic stu-
dents do very poorly.
Secondly, it is ridiculous to
have a student sit out his fresh-
man year and not practice with
his team. In this situation, we are
taking a kid who is undisciplined
to begin with (or he wouldn't be
in this situation) and putting him
on a campus of’10,000 to 20,000
students and hoping that a year
later he will have a'2.0 and be

eligible.

It's a proven fact that most

student-athletes do better scho-

lastically while they are par’
ticipating in sports, because they
are more disciplined and learn to
budget their time better.

l don't imagine that too many
Prop 48 kids are studying from
3:30 until 6 p.m.

Also, the iact that student-
athletes can keep their four years
of eligibility if they pay their own
tuition is a joke. In other words,

it's saying, ’-‘Let's find a rich alum-
nus to pay for an athlete's first
year of college.’’

Proposition 48 is a step in the
right direction, but the rule needs
to be improved upon.

One thought is that everyone
doesn't belong in a four-year col-
lege and shouldn't be there if the
only reason is to play sports.
Maybe the NFL or »the NBA
should ‘have 'minor—league pro-
grams to fulfill the needs of those

THE PlTl' NEWS, Friday, December 5, 1986‘

who excel in football or basket-
ball but don't have the ability or
desire for the college classroom.

The second change this season
in NCAA basketball is the three-
point play, in which a player gets
three points for any basket made
from 19 feet 9 inches and
beyond.

In effect, the rule is a good
idea, but the distance isn't far
enough. The intent of the rule is
to help the big man in the college
game by not letting the defenses
sag as much. Also, the rule is sup-
posed to make a place in the
game for the smaller shooting
guard.

First of all, the National Associ-
ation of Basketball Coaches vot-
ed this rule down by more than
a 2-1 margin. So now you have
a small committee making a de-
cision which is going to have a
big effect on the game.

At this point, I'm not sure ifany
one rule should be able to
change the game. A sub-par Rus-
sian team had been on tour in the
United States this fall. They won

The two big changes in college basketball

many more games than expected
because of the three-point rule,
plus the fact that they have been
using it for a couple of years.

At this early stage, it is difficult
to say what effect the new rule
will have. But one thing is for
sure: Some teams are shooting'25
to 30 shots from the three-point
range, while others have only
shot a few. ’

The first few weeks of the sea-
son should give a good indication
if a monster has been created.

Remember, officials have
enough problems as it is without
deciding whether or not 25 or 30
shots are outside the 3-point
circle. . -

Women
lose again,
61-56  

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team fell to rival West Vir-
ginia University 61-56 Wednes-
day night in front of approximate-
ly 1,000 evenly divided fans at
Altoona High School.

The Pitt fans were more.en-
thusiastic due to the homecom-
ing of Pitt freshman Jenny
Shingler. Shingler played on Al-
toona’s national championship
team last year with WVU fresh-

~ man" Tracy Slogik.

Lady Panther junior point
guard Valerie Halesworth called
Shingler ”the best thing that hap-
pened to our team this year. She's

going to do greatthings for us.” 

Unfortunately for the Lady Pan-
thers, Shingler did not have the
game she anticipated.

‘Literally, the bigstory is the
play of 6-5 senior Jenny Tyner.
For the "second consecutive
game, Tyner has come off of the

' bench to lead team scoring. She

was nine of 11 from the floor as
well as two for three from the foul
line. She has scored 41 points in
two games, shooting just shy of
80 percent from the field. Tyner,
however, is hesitant to take credit
for her achievements.

”The team is the greatest; that's

where all of my numbers come
from,” said Tyner.

Sophomore Tabatha Long start-
ed the game, but she ran into foul
trouble early. Tyner said that she
would like a chance to stalt, but

1‘.

xi!‘

there are advantages to coming ' A

off the bench. ”l get to watch
what's going on, see who's push-
ing and who needs pushed,” said

. Tyner. ’’I still have a lot of work‘
A to do. I had too many turnovers

[six], and my defense is never
perfect.” ‘

Junior point guard and team
leader Halesworth was six of
eight from the field and added
two from the foul line to make
her the only other Lady Panther
in double digits with 14.

”The team only comes back
harder from losses,” said
Halesworth. ”They are learning
experiences. What's going to
make Pitt come out on top of the

closejgames is 40 minutes of .

”l have no qualms about my
being the starting point guard for
the team this year. I'm confident,
I'm ready, the team is ready, and
we're going to win!”

Such are the perceptions of
starting point guard Mike Good-
son, as the Pitt basketball team
prepares to begin the new sea-
son. And how does Goodson
think the team looks so far?

”Fantastic!"

Goodson, a 6-3, 195—pound
sophomore from Elizabeth, N.J.,
is starting this year for the first
‘time in his Pitt career and may
just prove to be the key player on
the team. This is including the
fact that last year he never start-
ed and only averaged less than
four minutes per contest in 15 ap-
pearances. 1

’’I chose him because I thought
he looked the best out of anyone
in the position,” said head coach
Paul‘Evans. ”He is a strong, quick
athlete and possesses great phys-
ical skills. This is especially great
for a point guard.” _

”There is one rumor going
around about Mike that isn't quite

’ true, though,” continued Evans. _

”Some ‘think he may not be able

to handle any of the shooting .

chores. I personally feelhe may

’.

  
 

just be the second best shooter
we have on the team. Mike has
all the physical abilities to be a
classic point guard.”
Goodson’s performance in last
year's contest against Seton Hall
may just be a preview of what
Evans hopes to see from him this
year. In that game, he scored his
season high of eight points and
six assists in five minutes of play.
In the whole of last season, he
shot over 60 percent from the
field and had 10 total assists. He
has always proved . himself a
strong defensive player as well as
a great aggressive ball—handler.
But the key question is whether
or not he will be able to develop
into a strong enough point guard
as to solidify the starting lineup.
Is he ready?
’’I’m as ready as I'll ever be,”
said Goodson. ”This is just like
starting over again, just like fresh-

And so far this season, Good-
son is sticking to his claim. In the
slaughter of IUP, he made 12
points and five assists, and in

‘Wednesday's game against St. '_

think he needed these two games
to gain some confidence.”

player and Evans as coach seems
to be working out very well this
season, especially compared to
last season under former head
coach Roy Chipman. After a long
period of sitting on the bench at

As the season draws near, Pitt
women's gymnastic coaches
Debbie Yohman and Louie
Ligouri are having a difficult time
choosing a line-up.

Pitt’s Lady Panthers have an
abundance of depth and talent in
all events like never before. In a
preseason meet tonight, the Pitt
gymnasts hope to prove their
consistency against Indiana, Pa.,
and each other. Seven Pitt gym-
nasts are vying for only two all-
around positions on the team.
Theseven competitors are senior
Alisa Spector, juniors Beth
Waters, Kim Calserone and Lee
Ann Vaugn, sophomore Trish
Aser "and freshmen Sue Strauss
and Shelly Sleith. .

tain, is the only senior competing
