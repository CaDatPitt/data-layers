“Morethan being a duty to the school,” Adler said,
“riding the train will afford students some of the best fun
they will ever have in college.” ' . .

In a letter to the Pitt Student Congress, Gaylord Sheet,
‘president of the Michigan State Student Congress, informed
Pitt students that a ‘full program awaits them» on the E.
Lansing campus. ' in V 8 4 V‘  8

Sheets wrote that two all—ca_Inpus dances, featuring name
bands, will throw their doors open to the visitors. All fra-

On arrival -at E. Lansing, Pitt students will be taken on
a tour of the campus, one of the most beautiful Adler says,
in the United States. * V

“In addition _to planned activities, the train trip will
let students sit in on a colorful, colIege—town,Homecoming
celebration,” Adler said. '

‘If the quota of 400 passengers is tﬁlled by Tuesday, Adler
said, the train will leave the Pennsylvania and Lake Erie
Railroad Station at about midnight Friday and arrive at l\7

IF Hits SAE Bus, Backs Train

   

m

Inter—fraternity Council today coupled unoﬂicial repudia—v
tion of Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s “wildcat” bus with arspeeded
effort to push the Michigan State student train.

While lF’s regular meeting Wednesday, produced no

1eader’s opinions indicated that

the bus plan was deﬁnitely un-

popular by reason of the compe-

tition given the student congress———
' sponsored train.

The train today was short of
its quota by 2.50 riders, three school
days before the Tuesday deadline,
while the SAE bus is slated to
carry 30 fraternity members to
»Michigan State.

__ IF Council could not properly

take formal action against SAE,

President Joe Edmundson. said
~ after the meeting. “

If the SAE’s broke a social
committee ruling against small
groups competing with all—stu—

V dent functions, Edmundson reas-

oﬁicial condemnation of SAE’s¢
venture, a consensus of fraternity I oned student Congress was the

proper body to handle the case.

The IF president added that
several fraternities on their_own
initiative had already rebuked the
SAE’s.

The Council did recommend that
all fraternities‘ redouble efforts to
sell their members the $15 student
train tickets bé'fore next Tues-
day’s' deadline.

lF’s recommendation followed
speeches by Jack Burwinkle, Lar-
ry Adler, train chairman, and
Lester G. Brailey, assistant dean
of men, who stressed the'Council’s
position of campus leader in as-
suring the success of the train

and other all-student functions.

Evil Presented
Speaking of the way the dele-
gates will present the views of the
11 Security Council member na-
tions on the China question, Dr.
Albert Martin, assistant professor
~ of political science and faculty ad-
visor to the program, said, “Suc-
cess depends on presenting the ir-
responsible and evil as well as re-
sponsible ‘and moral.”

He added, “The UN Security
Council doesn't present an ideal
situation. To reﬂect it, we’ve

.got to start where things are.
The result may be a terrible ob-
ject lesson to the students wit-
nessing it.”

Parent on Race

BRUNSWICK, Me., Oct. 19—The
Bowdoin College chapter of Delta
Upsilon, national social fraternity,-
today had severed its affiliation
with the parent group. The all-
white fraternity had refused to
drop a Negro member tapped last
year.

The chapter’s action was sup-
ported by Bowdoin President Ken-
neth C. Sills and Dean of Men
Nathaniel C. Kendrick.

_ Delta Upsilon‘ President John A. .

Ritsher declared:
“When the path of brotherhood
diverges from that’ of freedom,

democracy and justice, it is the ’
‘ latter course which we must pur-

sue . . . ” ‘

President Ritsher declared that
the fraternity would continue to
operate as the “Delta Club.”

There is no Pitt chapter of Del-
ta Upsilon.

The Connecticut chapter of‘Phi
Epsilon Phi last year also pledged
a Negro. The national organiza-
tion suspended the chapter, - but
later rescinded its action. " .

The day after VJ-‘Day, engineers from a‘!

leading appliance manufacturer showed us
plans for their postwar refrigerator with a

, great new feature-—a king—st'ze freeze chest.

‘ But the size increase threatened prohibitive
costs. And no combination of metals so far
had satisﬁed the requirements: Fast heat
transfer; corrosion resistance; ease of fabri-
cation. They asked, “Can We do it eco-
nomically in aluminum?” .

Now the freezer is simply a sheet metal
box Withpassageways around it to conduct

.

the refrigerant. Knowing that aluminum is

an excellent conductor of heat, We suggested

_ that the evaporator be made by brazing

aluminum tubing to aluminum sheet.
“Sounds good,”’ they said and together we
started designs.

Aluminum Research Laboratories found
the answer to the ﬁrstimportant question:

Aluminum is compatible with most com-
monly ysed refrigerants. . .

Alcoa/s Process Development Shops sug-
gested an amazingly‘ simple fabrication
process, “Place the tubing on ﬂat brazing
sheet and furnace braze the assembly. Then
form the‘ unit into box shape.” The first 25
units were made in this manner—-a process
so practical and economical that it hasn’t
changed since. You’11 ﬁnd aluminum freezers,
formed by this method, in a great many re-
frigerators today. - .

This case is typical of the problems Alcoa
men undertake and solvp. Throughout the
Alcoa organization, similar challenging jobs

* are in progress and others are Waiting for

solve them.

i  ("man Along I  ‘

The Michigan ‘State trainistands ‘a good chance of never

"pulling out of the P.&L.E. Station. »

. Less than 40 per cent of the $15 tickets have
and the deadline is Tuesday.

4 There is no denying that the train campaign has been

been sold,

ihamstrung from every quarter.

The drive lost 37 passengers at one clip this week when
Sigma Alpha, Epsilon fraternity decided to send its own
bus to Michigan State. ' ‘ '

 , The SAE’s will end up paying $15.60 for the same trip

and" stadium seat that student train riders will get for $15.‘

The fraternity ﬁ°gures the extra cost is worthwhile, because
they willbe able to stay over at- East Lansing until Sun-
day morning, while the train is scheduled to leave the‘col-
lege town late Saturday night. _ I l

. But not to mention the fact‘ that the SAE trip is un-
lawful by Student Congress social rules, the Greeks are
morally in the wrong by taking a bus when an all-student
trip is available and reducing the chances of that all-stu-
dent trip ever getting out of the station. A
.  , IF Council should have formally rebuked SAE for its
‘f‘wildcat venture. But while most fraternities made it clear

that they disapproved, the Council, probably to preserve
aaffacade of solidarity, sidestepped any formal action.

A The Council did recommend to all fraternities thattrain

itickets be hustled among the chapters with redoubled vigor

before‘ the Tuesday deadline. sf  V _
, Some blame for the small sale of tickets must legiti-
mately fall on some old-hat rules of publicity decorum that

_somehow stay with us year after year.

You can’t sell a student train ticket by distributing leaf-

lets and colored posters. Ticket sellers should have been
'-allowed to set up a public address system in the Commons
1 Room, put on a program, and get a little rah-rah enthusiasm.

The hamstringers of the publicity department of the train,
including Commons Room Council, deserves a fat slice of
blame. ’ , ’

Last, the train campaigners themselves should long
ago have hit the obvious angle that the value in riding
the train is in the fun you get~out of it; not in support‘
for the team or in school spirit, or in any other cliche. ‘

Not only is one of the liveliest colleges in the country

.putting on their liveliest show of the year, but the train

ride will be one of the outstanding fun events in everyone’s
college career. ‘

A LETTER TO THE EDITOR I «

Editor,
Pitt News A "

x As was mentioned in the Wednesday, October
l7th,lissue of the Pitt News, Student Congress pass-
ed a resolution to the eﬁect, that they felt “the
Pitt News should bolster school spirit, not degrade
lit,” and authorized. me_ to write a letter.,to'the
Editor expressing our feelings more completely.

I would like to state now. that the argument"

does not center around theaancient “freedom of

the press” issue. I, as well as the other members_

‘of the ‘Student Congress, realize and fully appre-

ciate the fact that the Pitt News has the right"

” likes shouldn’t marrylikes: lsays it’s going‘ to

Press Freedom Not Issue

. and‘ have complete confidence in Captain Hamilton,jH

to print anything they desire. Furthermore, Stu-.. '

dent Congress, and I’m certain all other campus
organizations including the football squad,‘ wel-
comes constructive criticism. However, the con-

ﬂict' arises when the News prints articles and_

columns that blast the football team, Student Con-
gress, and, other campus organizations in a man-
ner that would do credit to a Winchell or Pegler.

, Remarks like those of Sports Editor Don Murdock

in the Wednesday, October 10th, issue of the Pitt
News, in which he suggested the possibility of
having majorettes or student managers take the
ﬁeld in place of our squad against opposing teams,
just don’t seem to do much for, school spirit. j

despite a few complaints whigh you’d expect to

“Yes it would,” Franny agreed. ah
Frieda reached down beside her and pulled 
a clipping out of herpurse. “Sure, here’s.the guy:

uses to put his theor-iestogether with.” . -
“Here’s what ‘he says: ‘It’s a principle of_-eué

said. ’ ‘ " '  
“There’s one bright spot, though,” said Frieda.
“He says thatithis big. decline will be gradual.”
‘‘It’s a‘ good thing,” said Franny,” you had me

\ Irish Strong Offensively

But the Irish aren’t all pass and
no run. Behind Mazur are half-
backs Billy Barrett, and John
Petitbon, and fullback Neil Wor-

scored ‘seven TD’s between them in
three games.

Coach Frank Leahy_ is expected
to alternate with three oﬁensive
formations—the “T,” the “I,” and
the old Knute‘ Rockne box.

Coach Tom Hamilton also ex-
pects to use more than one attack:
In the past the Panthers have sep-
arated their oﬁensive Linits-—one

Billy Sichko, 180—pound senior,
who has done most of his ball-
carrying from the single wing, has
gained 83 yards in 17 tries for a

24:4:/’ 8:

Sports Editor
A very important period in Pitt athletics will begin

.'at 2 p.m. tomorow afternon.

For at that time will begin a month which will deter-
mine the final outcome of the Panthers 1951 gridiron edition.
‘ The Jungle Cats will be deﬁnite underdogs against

the Irish tomorrow and the same can be expected in
clashes with Michigan State, Ohio State, and Rice.

As one Iowa football playelé

termed Pitt’s schedule, “Maybe an
All-American outﬁt could tackle

- it.” But the Panthers must face it

and hope for a streak of luck and
perhaps a victory or two.
Panther Wins Scarce

If the Blue-and-Gold could cop
two of the next four games, which
isn’t impossible by a longshot, this
year’s team would go down in Pitt

. history.

Pitt hasn’t defeated Notre

- Dame since 1937 when Jock

Sutherland led the Panthers to

7a .21-6 victory. The last time

Ohio State was licked by the
Panthers was in 1947 when Wes
Fesler-led, Pittites upset the

~ Buckeyes, 12-0.

Michigan State and Rice have

‘ never tasted defeat at the hands

of the Panthers. In fact Pitt. can
claim only eight victories over

‘their next four opponents.

Against Notre Dame, Pitt’s

-:chances of victory are about as

dim as the lighting in a movie

vtlieatre. And the defeat adminis-
tered the Irish by SMU last Week

didn’t help the Panther ‘cause in
the least, except for the fact that
maybe Pitt will pass more tomor-
row.

Pitt’s passing attack can’t equal
SMU’s Fred Benner’s amazing rec-

uord of a completed pass every

minute, but no one can say that

‘the Panthers are weak’ in the
‘aerial, department,

Six Passers Ready
Pitt has used six passers in the

 three games played to date. Bobby

Bestwick has completed 20 of the
39 attempted, Blair Kramer nine
of 20, Paul Blanda one of one, and
Hen_ry Ford one of one. Bob Os-
terhout and Billy Sichko have
tried three passes without acom-
pletion. -

Only ﬁve aerials have been in-
tercepted while three have gone
for touchdowns. Panther. pass-
ers have completed 31 passes of
64 attempted for a .485 average,
which isn’t bad in any league.

Reports from the Athletic De-
partment list Bestwick and end
Chris Warriner as doubtful starters
tomorrow, but you can _bet your
bottom dollar the two will see
action regardless of injury.

The competitive spirit of the
two lads is too great for them to
miss the all—important game to-
morrow. I'm looking. forward to
seeing Bestwick and Kramer toss-
ing passes all over the Stadium in
an effort to overhaul the Irish.
Strictly Rumor, But

ent coach of the Pittsburgh

to erupt involving one and possi-
bly two of Pitt’s basketball op-

ally the Pitt hoopsters have passed

without too much trouble. "

Harriers Meet Notre Dame  

In Bid for Third Victory .

_ Coach Carl Olson sends" ‘his
twice-victorious harriers in search
of their third win tomorrow mom-
in against a traditionally power-
fu -Notre Dame squad.

, The meet, to be run on the \rug-
ged Flagstaff Hill course at 11:00

A ‘ a.m., marks the thinclads’ fourth

outing, and gives them an oppor-

tunity to avenge last year's 24-33
Notre Dame defeat. ,
\ Two shutouts

The Pitt harriers enter the con-

-test with an enviable record. A

shutout victory in triangular com-
-petition against Geneva and Slip-
pery Rock in the season opener,
and a similar feat against Yale,
Dartmouth, and Columbia in a
quadrangular meet last week com-
prise their two victories.

The_ lone Panther setback was
suffered at the hands of a cham-
pion Penn State squad.

-. In tomorrow’s tilt, Coach Olson
is expected to send »his regular
starting seven in search of victory.

P. S. An  would

‘ ' certain’-.someo,n,e!

 

You’d be surprised, for example, at the number of sen-
: iors who don’t know that even if they don’t chose to buy an .
_ OWL, an accurate report on their -senior year at Pitt, they
can have their pictures and activities published free. You.
would also be surprised at the undergrads who don’t know
that with their purchase of the OWL, their pictures are enter-
ed, too. In fact, some people don’t even know that the OWL
will only cost them $6.00, thought it costs more than $10.00
to print. The difference ismade up by advertisers and the
good management of the editor, the business manager, and
their staffs. You see, if pre-arranged deadlines are met, and
the books are ordered, theprice is lower; this is the reason
that the price rises by onedollar after Nov. 16.

So, if anyoneasks-you to explain the antics of Mr. OWL

in the Tuck Shops, or at the game, you will be able to tell of

distinctive and an angle of public relations. Mr. OWL will be
a part of Pitt tradition'— just as much as the OWL yearbook
itself. He will serve to have people know of the OWL. ‘

Poor Staging Ruins I

antasy, Says Critic

(Ed. Note: Matinees for Peter Pan will be held on, Friday and

By DICK

. Saturday because the run is for only ﬁve days.)

SNYDER

-The theater’s most disillusioning moments occur when

a fantasy does not quiet ‘come

off, and unfortunately for the

Nixon, James M. Barrie’s Peter Pan is that fantasy.
Certainly this is not Barrie’s fault. In Peter Pan. he has

given the stage a warm and time.-¢

less excursion into lively make-
believe, but his effort has run
afoul of staging that can best be

that should never
have gone beyond a rehearsal
stage. . _

' For time has not dimmed a kilo-
watt of Barrie’s tale of pirates and
fairies and Indians and the never
never “land of childish belief; of
mermaids singing and children
ﬂying and talented alligators.

Everything: There _

The ingredients are all there,
and only the present company is
to blamefor the frailties at hand.
The warmth and charm and be-
lief left in their keep goes ﬂying
out the window, and this is a sad
thing.

No, small part of Peter Pan’s
_lack lies with the technical, direc-
tion. You cannot reasonably ex-
pect an audience to believe in air-
borne children after watching
them fasten their wire attach-
ments on stage. Too, the lighting
of several scenes appeared to be
at the electrician’s leisure.

On the credit side, I thought
that Leonard Bernstein’s inci-
dentalmusic was pleasant, with
a- lilt and charm of its own; that
Ralph Alswang has designed sev-

and that the dances and costumes
are colorful and not without imag-
ination.

The acting is something else
again. For Veronica Lake there
are sharp and early indications
that she has caught a brittle, har-
