Jack Brown, advisor to the Pitt
Union Program Council, has been
jtemporarily relievediof his duties
. by acting‘ Vice Chancellor for
. Student‘ Affairs i William Markus.
’ The move follows weeks of
. controversy surrounding the pro-
gram counci1’s violation of several
University and Carnegie Music
Hall regulations in programming
the Homecoming Week Chuck
Mangione Concert.

Markus was unavailable for

assistant Gary Houston, the move
to relieve Brown of his duties» was
not directly related to either the
Mangione controversy or the
resignation of Bud Heaps, former
director‘of the Office of Student
Activities, last week.

“Brown could be reinstated—he
hasn’t been ﬁred,” Houston said.
“This is just a time for us to.step

why‘ it isn’t’ living’ up to the

Brown ‘will continue in ‘his

“Speaking for myself and the
PUPC committee chairmen we feel
that this is a positive move,”
Tammy Haddad,’ Pitt Union Pro-
gram Council Chairwoman, said.
“What it means now is that we’re
all going to have to pull together to
keep the organization running.
These changes that are happening
are a plus for both Pitt and PUPC.”

Haddad said that until the issues
surrounding Brown's position are

, resolved, the program council will
be operating under the guidance 01-

graduate assistants who work‘ in
the program council office.

— plan to circulate petitions calling for

9 it — ‘a vote by dormitory residents.

Tower C residents met. Friday

ii" * j night" to discuss what action they

might take.

We are goingtgw have to impress
them (administrators) with the

. volume of people who are against .

this,” said Kim Biehl, one resident
at the meeting.

' To show their support of a vote
demand, those residents decided to

circulate petitions in_ all dormitories . .

 and present them to William
Markus, vice-chancellor for student
affairs at the next Student Affairs
Advisory Committee meeting
. Thursday.

The petition ‘reads, “We, the
undersigned resident students of
the University of Pittsburgh,
demand the right to a binding vote

 iOffice of Residence Life Denies Vote on Housing Lottery

on the housing allocation policy for
the 1979-80 school year.”
Fonseca defended the policy and

argued that students had been
represented when the proposal"

originally was -drafted last spring.
According to Fonseca, Resident

Student Association members were .
consulted when the proposal was

written. ‘‘I can’t emphasize
enough there was representastion
last yearf’ he said.

Tower.C residents at the meeting
did not agree there was enough
representation. William Sunner,
for example, commented on the
proposal:

“The worked on it through the
spring and summer. Who at Pitt
goes to school in the spring and
summer?” A

Dormitory council presidents in
Lothrop Hall and Holland Hall said
there was mixed feelings on the new

room assignment proposal in their A

halls. Nancy Annunziato, Holland
Hall dormitory council president,
said many students at a dormitory
meeting concerning the process said
they believed the new system was
fair. A
“We brought it up at dorm
council, and a lot of people think it’s
the fairest way possible. I'm not
sure a lot of them really understood
it though,” said Annunziato. 9
She explained that many thought
the new system affected selection of
speciﬁc fooms and had nothing to
do with actually securing on-cam-
pls housing. Annunziato said she
‘planned to explain the system
further at future meetings.

Debbie Roberts, Lothrop ‘Hall '
dorm council president, said most of
the comments on the new
procedures that she has heard from
residents in her dorm have been
negative. . .

“They have been pretty much

against it,” Roberts said. “People
have waited until they are seniors to
get top priority and now only 10
percent of the rooms are going to be
open to them. A lot of people are
really disappointed and really
scared they are not_going to get a
room.” ‘ _

Student Government Board
member Jan Medoff, who said
many students have complained to
him about the new procedures, said
the residents should get a- chance to
vote on the lottery system.

‘ ‘It's the Proposition’ 13 mentality
that they want the chance to vote on
it,” said Medoff. ,“No matter what
system is used, everybody can’t get
a room, so they should be able to
choose what "system they want. ’ ’

Medoff added he would make sure
the new room assignment system
was discussed at Thursday’s
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee meeting.

The Week

The new dormitoryiroom assign-
ment system was designed after
there were problems with the old,
method of assignment last year.
Applications were mailed Feb. 15,
and the ﬁrst 2,300 students to
submit their application and $100
deposit received a room.

By 3 p.m. on Feb. 16 the 2,300
spaces all Had been ﬁlled. Many
students complained they had not
been warned sufficiently about the
time schedule for room assignments
and had not been able to get the
deposit in on time.

During March, the Resident
Students Association and admini-
strators from the Office of
Residence Life and from thef‘
Housing Office met to design the
new procedure. Ten other
universities and colleges were
consulted on their assignment
procedures before the new system
was established. ’

Haddad‘ speculated on the
relationship between the resigna-
tion of Heaps and the move against
Brown.

“If I. were just a student
following these stories in the

‘newspaper, I really would believe

there was some connection be-
tween the two,” Haddad said. “I'
really don’t doubt for a minute that
the whole PUPC thing was a big
weight on Heaps’ mind when he
was director of student activities.”

Haddad added that she agreed
with‘. Markus, who has said he
believed that the students were not
to blame for the program council

“PUPC was very much pushed

that anyone there really cared for

the turn of events that happened to '

issues it (the Mangione controver-
sy) never would have happened.”

Haddad said that she was glad

I 7. ' . will begin at 3:45 'p.m. in the Frick

Schmitt, the last man to walk on

"this year as one of the most

heading as most other ﬁrst-year
senators as a member of the “New
Artillery on the Right” or the
“Cactus Conservatives.’ ’

The senator holds a doctorate
from Harvard in geology, distin-
quishing him as the only scientist
in the Senate. He believes the
scientiﬁc _backround should serve
as a strong basis for his claims
concerning the /energy bill, which
he calls “a regulatory nightmare.”

“The bill has its underlying

assumption that Americans want
more regulation,” he said.

According to a recent story in the
Post

Schmitt said, “I do not think
Americans want more regulation.
For one thing, they are tired of
being told what to do in every facet
of their lives. They want to try to do
it themselves, as we used to...”

Besides his stand on Carters
energy bill, Schmitt has been
known to take a ﬁrm stand on other
controversial issues, ranging from
his opposition to giving aid to
financially troubled New York City
to abortion.

“I’m not a joiner,_” said Schmitt .
who, alongwith a small group of
other senators helped torpedo the «
labor law reform bill and tried to
block the Panama Canal Treaties.

i_i-Protesting the
 .   Win-a-Dorm

Lottery  

With little regard for the actual opinions of most
dormitory residents, the Office of Residence Life has
decided to go ahead and use the new room-
assignment procedures that were drafted originally
last spring. Many resident students had asked the of-
fice to submit the proposal to_ a vote first, but Fred"
Fonseca, director of the Office of Residence Life,
and William Markus, vice-chancellor for student af-

 fairs, apparently. decided it was too late to try to

revamp the procedure at this late date.

When making their decision, the administrators
seemingly had little concern about student opinion,
which now is being voiced almost universally by up-

perclassmen. The majority of the students we have" i

heard vehemently oppose the new Win a Dorm Room
Game. A

V The opposition among upperclassmen is both un--
derstandable and justified, With little warning,

‘seniors who always have received first priority during‘

room assignment now are being told they arepersona

non grata anddeservetto be at the bottom of the pile»

when it comes time for room assignment.

. This radical shift in policy’ means seniors must
struggle to find a decent place to live, if they are not
one of the fortunate seniors who win the lottery and
get a room on campus. Considering the exceedingly
short supply of decent, affordable student housing in
Oakland or the rest of Pittsburgh, many seniors now
living in ‘dorms may face a less-than-pleasant final

Page 6--Monday, November 13, 1973 P

Although a deaf ear has been turned to this idea,
there is some hope for students who still demand a
vote on the question. If resident students show
overwhelming supportfor the vote proposal being
supported by Tower C residents, Chancellor Posvar
and his underlings might see the follyof their ways

A and allow resident students to vote on the question.

The only way residents can show their support is to
sign the petitions now circulating throughout cam-
pus. If students do not ‘want the room assignment to
be decided by the chance pull of a slip of paper from
a fish bowl, they should act immediately and sign one
of the petitions when they are presented with it. It’s
the only chance they have to try to stop a system that

foolishly leaves room assignments to be decided by;

fickle fate.

Rather, this government is dedic-
ated to the continuing oppression
of the black population.

This interim government does
grant universal suffrage to every-
one 18 and older. However, the

-need to be studies closely to realize
it pushes the African majority out
of any kind of real power.

—Whites are guaranteed 28
seats out of 100, 20 of whichare

which are elected by everyone from
a list of 16 who are nominated by
white members of the House of.
Assembly.

——Blacks are guaranteed 72 seats
out of 100'(although they are 96
percent of the population).

—Eight entrenched provisions
institutionalizing .racism remain

‘untouched, and '_ 78 votes are

needed to change them (i.e. six
white votes as well as 100 percent
of the blacklvotes). Concretely,
although whites are 4 percent of
the population, they own 50
percent‘ of the land. The land can
not be redistributed without white
votes. ,

, —Whites retain total domination
of the judiciary, civil service and

, —Finally, Smith, the sworn
enemy of the Zimbabwean people,
will be on the Excutive Council as

ment. The position gives him
unchallangeable veto power.

gressmen fought for . Smith’s

administration gave the trip tacit’
support by allowing Smith into the
well as providing
continual access to Secretary ‘of

State Cyrus _Vance; Smith’ made,
‘two concessions while here to

appear ,“reasonable." He abol-
ished all laws that were overtly
racist, and he agreed to an all-party
conference that would include the
interim _ government and the
Patriotic Front. (The Patriotic Front
is a‘ united front of the national
union and the people's union.)
These concessions must be put
into perspective. The laws estab-
lishing segregation were based on
race; now discrimination will be
based on income (which is based on
race). The average white income is
11 times that of the average black. A

three-tiered, arrangement will be _

' "moI're_ ludicrous whenwe realize the .

transitional government is putting
this forth as a real solution.

Muzorewa said, “Discrimination
is finished, scrapped. I’maso happy
I could jump off the top of the
roof." The people of Zimbabwe
think he should be pushed.

The second concession is the
all-party conference for which the
United States has been pushing.
America wants very badly to
negotiate a settlement in which the
Patriotic Front is included, but in
the minority. In other words: . Stop
the fighting, take away the
people's armies and give the
Patriotic Front a non-decisive role
in the government. ~

Robert Mugabe, president of the
national union, is aware of this plan

but is not worried. He says whether‘
elections are held under British or .

U.N. auspices, or the war is fought
to the finish, the ‘Patriotic Front
will be victorious because it
receives the overwhelming support
of the Zimbabwean people. The
Patriotic Front says, “The problem
in Zimbabwe is not the election of a

-president but the destruction of

colonialism and its institutions, the
attainment of genuine indepen-
dence ‘and the deinocratization not
only of the vote but of all
institutions and the way of life in
Zimbabwe.”

It is a real switch for the US.‘
government not to be backing the’

most reactionary po'sition around.

“Restructuring Program Council In to ‘Resource Center’ 0

Letters

The recent controversy over the
Pitt’ Union Program Council has

. pointed out that the council is, at

best, lacking in coordination and
input from the organizations it has

worked with. The slipshod manner
in which the Black Week and
Mangione. concerts were handled
are the sort of mistakes that a central
programing unit such as the council
was created to prevent. To prevent
similar errors in the future, a
number of suggestions from a wide
range of sources have been put

ﬁforward to correct the defects in the

x

4;

council’s present structure.

None of these suggestions has
touched on what we feel is the core of
the issue, the continued existence of
the council in anything near its
present form.

There are a number of grave
defects in the present set-up of the
council, defects that cannot be
rectiﬁed by minor improvements or
changes.

Perhaps our basic complaint is the
three-year length of the council
contract. By signing a three-year
pact the ‘Student Government Board
has saddled the next two boards with
the council regardless of the feelings
of future board members or the

needs and abilities.

students who elect them. This
contract effectively denies the
student population any say in how
$110,000 of its student activities fees
will spent for two years. We ﬁnd this
inexcusable. We urge that future
zontracts be limited to one year in
ength, regardless of the structure of
:he council.

In its present form the council also
usurps the allocative functions of the
SGB and allocations committee. A
student group seeking funds must
now go through the council, none of
whose members were elected,
rather than their elected represent-
atives on the SGB. Nor were
council’s committee heads approved
by a vote of the SGB.

In addition the council has yet to
produce the statement of purpose
agreed to at the last Student
government Board Assembly meet-
ing. If such a paper has been issued,
neither of our organizations have
been notiﬁed.

The College Young Democrats
and the Black Action Society propose

;a general restructuring of the council

into a resource center, with student
organizations having the option to
use it if an organization feels it needs

went into a solo improvisation that
did not highlight any of Zawinul’s

dexterity on the keyboards. It was as i
if he were in a hurry to get through
with the number and go on to
something else. ,
Each member of the group went
through similar solo improvisations

According to recent Nielson
survey,_ pocket billiards is the
nation’s second most popular
participant sport (behind bowling).
Noting this, Nick Varner, two-time
intercollegiate pocket billiards
champion, considers himself “a
goodwill ambassador.”

stimulate interest in the sport,”
said Varner, who appeared at the
Student Union last week.‘

Varner in the past decade has
won a number of tournaments‘ and
defeated the famed Minnesota Fats
in a challenge match. Although he
has never won the world champion-
ship, Varner consistently has
ranked among its top ten players,
once ﬁnishing second.

“I’ve always enjoyed pocket
billiards,” Varner said.’ “When
you like something, you are bound

become good at it. I am lucky in

Varner started playing when he

Tyner Album Features Povverful Piono    

By—GARYBRADFORD
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Greeting

McCoy Tyner
McCoy Tyner’s latest live album,
.“The Greeting,” presents one
I great problem and one great virtue.
The problem is that ,it’s one
record, whereas Tyner’s previous

I live albums, "‘Enlightement” and

“Atlantis,” were two-record stes,
allowing time for extended sales.
On this record the sales seem
constricted, even chopped off in

order to fit. each side. A band only wish is that there were more of

situation, since some of the finer
young jazz men -- saxophonists Joe
Ford and ‘George Adams and
drummer Jonship Theus -- were in
Tyner’s group at the time of this
recording.

Their usual ﬁery, full-blooded
improvisations are muted hero,
except on “Hand in Hand,” which
seems to be the only unedited track.
Unlike some of Tyner’s former
sidemen, these musicians aren’t
overpowered by their leader. The

them.

- The virtue is, of course, Tyner.
He?s a modern day Art Tatum; both
possess overwhelming piano tech-

-nique, both sweep over all but the
strongest musicians like tidal

waves, and both are at their best I

playing alone.

On “The Greeting,” Tyner plays
“Naima” unaccompanied, and
does it tenderly and emotionally,
making it a tribute to its composer-
Tyner’ s former leader, the late John
Coltrane. ‘ '

On the up-tempo cuts like “Fly
with the Wind,” Tyner is super-
powere_d; rocking block chords,
high-speed arpeggios and complex
rhythms. Deﬁnitely not for Barry
Manilow’ fans. _

For the listner unfamiliar with
Tyner, “The Greeting” is a decent
introduction, though not nearly as
powerful as his earlier live sets.

The Tyner fan may ﬁnd the record
disappointing and frustrating, but

«only because of the time butchery.

There won’t be any disappoint-
ment with Tyner’s style.

Superior Collection

By LARRY LUNSFORD
Barbra Streisand’s Greatest Hits
Volume 2 '
Columbia Records

The new Barbra Streisand album,
“Greatest Hits Volume 2,” is
selling for the cost of a double
album although it's a single record.
It’s worth the cost.

“Greatest Hits Volume 2”
contains ten of Streisand’s recent
best, and th_e album should be a
gold’ seller before the month is over.
It’s a collection of mellow mood 1
music that will keep the money‘
ﬂowing in for_ the Hollywood
singer-star. ‘

11

It seems surprising that record
companies put out greatest hits ‘
albums since it would appear that
sales on the individual albums on
-which the songs appear would
decrease. Undoubtedly they know
what they’re doing. Barbra’s
Volume 2 takes us back to 1973 with
her memorable hit from the movie,
“The Way We Were.” This has‘
been called one of the most beautiful *1‘
love songs of all time. She starred
with Robert Redford in this one, and
both the song and movie grossed
millions. A

Three of her 1978 hits appear on
the album, including the recently
released duet with Neil Diamond,
“You Don’t Bring Me Flowers.”
Another is the dynamic “Love
Theme From ‘Eyes of Laura Mars’ ”
or “Prisoner” from the movie
“Eyes of Laura Mars,” which is still

_ on the Pittsburgh circuit.

“The Way We Were’ ’ seems to be.

second-favorite has to be chosen,
“All In Love Is Fair” has to be it.
Streisand’s version’ of Stevie

V Wonder’s ‘song is simply superb.

: Pitt Decapitates wvu in 52-7 Rout

ByBOBLABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
It came at a time when the bowl‘
scouts needed to be impressed, and
representatives from the Tangerine,
Holiday, Hall of Fame’ and Garden
State bowls undoubtedly enjoyed it.
It came at a time when fans were
beginning to make a bottle of No-Doz
a necessity to watch the Pitt offense.
It came at a time’when bettors not
‘ only questioned whether Pitt could
defeat even a poor West Virginia
team by 17 points, but also whether
the Panther offense could score that
many points in one week.

‘ ‘You might say it was a long time
coming,” said quarterback Rick
Trocano. “I’m just glad it came.”

“It” was the biggest offensive
output since last year's Army
game; 501 total yards and 52 points
as Pitt, now 7-2, decapitated West
Virginia, 52-7, Saturday at Pitt
Stadium.

Rooster Jones temporarily muz-
zled the “big back” enthusiasts
with 169 yards on 18 carries,
Trocano completed 13 of 17 passes
to four receivers and the Panthers
attained the offensive balance coach
Jackie Sherrill has been dreaming
about. .

“We needed a game like this for
our football team,” said Sherrill.
“It was surely a confidence
restorer. Ihope this game will be a
turnaround for our team.

‘ ‘We've had a rough three weeks,
and I thought we were coming out of
it in the fourth quarter against
f  Syracuse,” Sherrill added. T“Now

’ ' "we can concentrate on improving ‘

week by week again. Maybe now we
P can‘ develop into the outstanding
 7 ‘football team I thought we could
' become by the end of the season.”
A couple more performances like
Saturday's and Pitt will be well onn

its way.

_' Trocano was easily as outstand-
ing as Jones. Expert in his handling
of the option and poised in the pass_
pocket, Trocano finally may have

yards and adding 27 on the ground,
the sophomore also exhibited to the
crowd of 53,074 his knowledge of
the Pitt offense by calling many of
the plays from the line of
scrimmage.

“We had two outstanding
performances today——by Ricky and
Rooster,” said Sherrill. “Ricky
audibledabout 85 percent of the.
time and called all the right plays.
‘Rooster ﬁnally ran up to his
potential. He read his blocks and
his keys and just ran by some people .
today.

“We were ready to write him -
(Rooster Jones) off, ” Sherrill added
tongue-in-cheek. “We were going
to put him in a box and ship him
back to Mississippi.” v

Trocano silenced the quarterback
critics, Jones’ performance vindi-
cated the running backs and not
even Sherri]-l’s staunchest critics
‘could say Pitt’s offensive game plan
was not wide open enough.

There were several first-down
passes, an end around to Gordon
Jones, a ﬂea ﬂicker and aghalfback
option with Lindsay Delaney
sneaking in to play half back. Even
though the end didn't go for a big

. gain, Trocano missed a wide open
Steve Gaustad on the ﬂea ﬂicker
(settling for a 14-yard pass to Larry
Sims) and Delaney’s pass was
intercepted, Sherrill had the
Mountaineers’ attention with his
play calling. _

“My wife gave me the game plan
and told me I couldn’t come home if
I didn’t, follow it,” said Sherrill.  .

While the Panther 3offense' was >, -

Just when everyone was ready to write them off for
this year and ‘make skiing reservations for the days
P surrounding Christmas, Pitt has to go and project
themselves right back into the bowl picture with a V
terribly impressive 52-7 win over West Virginia.

The timing was perfect. Playing before represen-
tatives of four bowls,-the Panthers finally put it all
together and ran over the Mountaineers like they
were mole hills. Non-believers (myself included)
thought the pregame betting line of 18 points
favoring the Panthers might be a steal if one went
with West Virginia. That, and a few other assum-
ptions, were dismissed as false Saturday.

ever is to have an excellent running game.

Apparently not, if Saturday’s game is any in-

Rooster Jones, the sophomore from
Pascagoula, Miss. shattered the Big Back Theory
with an outstanding performance. His 169 yards in
18 carries was Pitt’s highest rushing output of the
year. His 50-yard run in the third quarter was the
longest run from scrimmage for the year. Running

the fourth quarter with a big smile and mumbled
something about big backs. "Moore is fiercely loyal to
his runners, and he must view the performance by
Jones as near-total vindication for his players.
ASSUMPTION TWO: Pitt’s offense is too

One game doth not a wide-open offense make, but
the Panthers did jazz things up a little Saturday.

Trocano apparently didn’t see: tight end Steve
Gaustad open behing the secondary and hit Sims
curling out of the backfield instead. It was after this
play that many of the fans checked their programs to
see just what game they were watching.

Why the ‘change in offensive philosophy? Coach

Jackie Sherrill made a joke about how his wife for-
mulated the game plan and told him not to return
home unles he executed it. But what is probably
closer to, the real reason is that an open offense can
score points. High point totals impress bowl scouts,
and impressed bowl scouts mean bowl bids.

ASSUMPTION THREE: Pitt’s quarterbacks only
look to one receiver.

' This theory lost its validity when Gaustad, made 11:

receptions against Navy and was. solidified Saturday.

says: “They remember what you do in November.’’ :
This week in November Pitt had 501 yards in total
offense while allowing 148 yards, just 35 on the
ground. It doesn’t matter whether you are playing a
poor West Virginia team or the Little Sisters of the
Poor, 501 yards is a lot of offense. .
Pitt had the offensive balance necessary to win big:
218 yards passing and 283 yards rushing. The Pan-
thers did have four turnovers, but none were the
crippling drive-stoppers that previous miscues have
been. They averaged 6.6 yards per play. '

Impressive Panther Offense

(Continuedfrom page 12)
had trouble stopping the opposition
after a- Panther turnover, but like
the offense, the defense threwvaway
the script this week.

Pitt turned the ball over five

times—two interceptions and three
fumbles—but West Virginia failed
to capitalize on any of them.
V Midway through the third period
with Pitt leading, 28-7, Gordon
Jones fumbled the kickoff following
the Mountaineer touchdown, and
Jeff Seals recovered at the Panther
24-yard line. On the next play, Dave
DiCiccio intercepted a Dutch
Hoffman pass, which, five plays
later, was turned into the ﬁfth Pitt
touchdown. V

“The interception by DiCiccio
was really a backbreaker and turned
the tide,” said Mountaineer coach
Frank Cignetti. “I don't know if we
would have come back, but we were
starting to jell, and that play really

-killed out last hopes,”

The relief in the locker room after
the game was about as subtle as the
horsing around and the blaring
music. The unit Sherrill] had been
defending all year ﬁnally had come
around, and it was led by the two

-.people he had said all ‘along were

quality football playeii-s—Trocan,o

and Rooster Jones. How does
Sherrill spell relief? O-f-f-e-n-s-e.
“It’s always nice to win, and it’s
best to win big,” said Trocano.
In light of the lopsided win, bowl
speculation once again became a

major topic of discussion. Sherrill '

said he would talk about any options
the Panthers have with the seniors
today.

“Anywhere where it’s warm,”
said Al Chesley when asked what
his input into that discussion would
be. ‘ ‘That new bowl (Holiday Bowl)
in San Diego sounds nice. If you
don't want a free ticket to
California, you got to be crazy.”

“It was just a good old whipping
that Pitt put on our tails,” said
Cignetti.

It's about time.

Los Angeles Prevails in Regular

By The Associated Press

LOS ANGELES——Pat Haden
threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to
Willie Miller in the fourth quarter,
breaking the Los Angeles Rams
loose from the rugged Pittsburgh
defense for a 10-7 National Football
League victory over the Steelers last
Sunday night in their nationally
televised game.

A brilliant 26-yard run by John

V Cappelletti, breaking tackles by

Dwight White and Joe Greene at the
line of scrimmage, put Los Angeles
in position for the winning pass.
The beleaguered Haden had been
sacked twice in the game and
knocked out of action at one point
before calmly unloading the touch-
down throw with 5:27 left to play. _
I The defeat was only the second for
Pittsburgh in 11 games and put the
Rams’ record at an identical 9-2.

After falling behind 14-8 in game
two, PSU came back to, win 16-14.
While Penn State was coming back,
the Terps had several opportunities
to take the game, but couldn’t get
that last point.

Then it was time for the premier
match of the evening -- Pitt vs.
Maryland. In‘ game one, Pitt
jumped out to a 3-0 advantage and
still held the lead at 6-5. Maryland
tied the score at six and Pitt fell
apart after that, losing 15-8.

Head coach Mike Hebert said,
“We played the wrong defense in
the first game, and really didn’t play
well together as a team.” -

After a scoreless first half,

Game two began in similar
fashion, with Maryland jumping out
to a 1-0 lead after an exchange of
serves. Pitt then went on a scoring
rampage behind the strong spiking

of Cindy Chambers and Ingrid-

Mueller and some great saves by
Pat (Stretch) Montgomery. Pitt
scored 15 points in a row to win the
game 15-1. 1

“We changed our defense in the
second game,” said Hebert. “We
put Stretch in the middle blocker’s
position, which takes -of lot of
reading of the other team’s defense.
She gobbled up every ball that came
near her.”_ I

District Meet Closes Out Harrier Season

ByMARIASClULLO

,'.,KP1'tt News Staff Writer

The race had‘ been over for 15
minutes when Pitt assistant cross-

country coach Mel Boyd informed

his lead runner, Gary Siriano, that he
had missed qualifying for NCAA‘
championships by one place.

“I had no idea I was that close to
qualifying for nationals, Siriano
said. I only found out after the
results of the race were posted. My
only thought after that was to go back
and run the whole damn race over
again.”

Although having placed 28th
overall--after those runners who

already had qualifyed with their‘

teams for the NCAA meet in
Wisconsin were elimated from the
-standings--the Panther harrier ﬁn-
ished 7th. The top six individuals
plus top ﬁve teams were eligible.

Pitt ended its season at the District
11 Championships last Saturday with
the race at Lehigh University.

Siriano’s 10-kiliometer ‘run was n

accomplished in 31:06.3, followed
for Pitt by Mark Studnicki, who was

88th in 32:22. ‘Next came Randy
Bailey 33:05, 113th; Bob Landstrom
33:31, 127th; Dan Datillo 34:16,
140th; and Bob Lee 34:46. 145th.

merly’ of Allegheny Community
College, covered the fairly ﬂat, dry
course in 29:59.9, one second in
front of teammate Sydney Maree.
Penn State ace John Ziegler was
third overall.

Penn State literally ran away with
the team title by Scoring a mere 42
points. The Lions outpaced

Villinova, which ﬁnished with 69 '
points. The Panthers ended up 18th 3

out of 28 schools represented from
District II, comprising states east of

Oklahoma, Southern ‘California’,
Michigan and ‘Houston-—‘have each
stumbled once, and‘ defending‘
champ Notre Dame has been

fourth-ranked Nebraska 17-14 on
touchdown runs ‘of ﬁve andeight
yards by Rick. Berns and I.M. Hipp
and Billy Todd’s t_ie-breaking‘

' 24-yard ﬁeld goal with 11:51 left to

play. Oklahoma’s six lost fumbles
didn’t’ hurt" Nebraska, either.
Nebraska's victory, which ended

. six years of frustration at the hands

of its arch-rival, left the Corn-
huskers thinking ‘thoughts of 1‘: a
trip to represent the Big Eight in
the Orange Bowl and ‘2: a possib_le

_ national‘ championship.

The Sooners’ Billy Sims, the

minutes. His bobble. at the
Nebraska 3-yard line ’ with 3:27

chance while Sooner turnovers set
up Nebraska’s two touchdowns.
Penn State needed four ‘ﬁeld

; goals by Matt’Bahr——-33, 32, 37,»

and ‘30 yards——top turn back ' -N.C.
State. After Bahr tied the NCAA
record of 21 ﬁeld goals in a season,
the Nittany ‘Lions ‘got their only‘

rusher in history, to 71, yards in 22
carries, including a 2-yard run that

bama trounced No. 10 Louisiana
