SGB presidential candidates battle it out at debat

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Dan Taylor put Jim Mumma on the
defensive for much of Monday night’s
Student Government Board presiden-
tial debate, implying that Mumma was
‘ ‘reclining on the beach” while Taylor
was working on the SGB, and that
Mumma might be a “cheerleader” as
president.

“We have enough cheerleaders on
the football ﬁeld every Saturday,”
Taylor said. “What we need is some-
one who is willing to do research and
hard work.”

“I have no desire to be a
cheerleader,” Mumma replied. “As
far as reclining on the beach, I was in
constant contact with the Student
Government Board all summer long. ”

Taylor responded, “Yes, Jim, I can
recall being in the office when your
phone calls came in and it was hearten-
ing to hear from you.”

Both candidates are presently on the

SGB, and they agreed the board should ‘

continue to push Pitt’s administration
to completely divest university funds
from companies doing business with
South Africa.

-“I think we can, as the new board
comes in, say to the administration ‘we
reaffirm our belief,’ ” Taylor said.
“Let’s get our hands out of the whole
mess altogether.”

“I think we need to divest from
South Africa,” Mumma said. “I think
we need to look at the situation respon-
sibly and really look and see where our
money’s going to go once we withdraw
it from South Africa."

The university currently follows a
policy of selective divestment from

companies doing business in South
Africa. Pitt divests from companies not
adhering to the Sullivan Principles, a
set of rules governing equal rights for
white and black workers.

’ Taylor and Mumma both said they
thought it would be important for the
new president to help the new SGB run
smoothly. There will be no returning
board members from last year.

“As far as I’m concerned, the stu-
dent government needs to really work
together,” Mumma said. “The Student
Government Board is elected as a col-
lective group. With the limited people
we have, we shouldn’t have so many
diverse interests. I think it is important
for the president to move the SGB

Posvar defends
Farrakhan speech  

By Michael Adebimpe
For The Pitt News

Barely one week before his arrival
on Pitt’s campus, the controversy con-
tinues about the invitation of Nation of
Islam leader Rev. Louis Farrakhan.
Farrakhan is scheduled to speak on
Thursday, Nov. 14, in Fitzgerald Field
House.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar told
The Pitt News that the university must
protect the right of an individual to
speak. “It is a commitment — the com-
mitment is important,” Posvar said.
“It is a matter of academic freedom,
freedom of opinion. I don’t agree with
Mr. Farrakhan, and I strongly oppos-
ed his views about the Jewish, but if
the students- want to hear him, they
have the right.” Posvar pointed out that
the whole issue is included in Pitt’s
policy concerning controversial
speakers. «

The first paragraph of the policy, ap-
proved by the executive committee of
Pitt’s board of trustees on Oct. 10,
1967, states: “If men are to value
freedom, they must experience it. If
they are to learn to choose wisely, they
must know what the choices are;.and
they must learn in an environment
where no idea is unthinkable and where
no alternative is withheld from their
consideration. ’ ‘

The policy further states: “For their
part, colleges and universities must
hold vital the student's right to know.
When the so-called controversial
speaker is invited to the campus by a

.'.. 1. .p _..

recognized campus organization, he
speaks not because he has the right to
be heard, but because the students have
a right to hear. It is the student’s right
to hear that the university must defend
if it is to serve its high function in socie-
ty. "
Under this policy, Posvar defended
the action of the Black Action Society
in inviting Farrakhan to Pitt.

To Dr. Barbara Sizemore, the acting
chairman of the Department of Black
Studies, the issue is a question of
freedom. She argued that the Constitu-
tion provides for freedom of speech.
“Under the Constitution, Farrakhan
has the freedom to speak, and people
also have the right to come or not to, ’ ’
Sizemore said.

She explained that an event like this
also shows racism. “What Louis Far-
rakhan is doing now is a cyclical event
— it’s been ‘done in the past. It happens
over and over again,” Sizemore ex-
plained. “Booker T. Washington did
it in 1895, Marcus Garvey picked it up
in the 1920s, Alhaji Mohammed in the
1940s, Louis Farrakhan in the 1980s.
Events like this happen when racism
deprives black_people of their rights.”

Sizemore said she is against all forms
of racism and bigotry. However, she
admits she has never had the opportuni-
ty to listen to Farrakhan speak. “I am
opposed to Rev. Farrakhan if he says
bad things about the Jewish people,”
she said, “ but I haven’t heard him say
anything of that sort.”

Sizemore did agree that people have
the right to protest but not to be violent:
“If there’s violence, I hope the cam-
pus police will take care of that.”

together, butalso to be an active part
of the organization.”
Taylor disagreed. He said that a dif-
ference of opinion in the SGB is not
always bad. “I think it’s healthy to
have a difference of opinion among dif-
ferent board members,” Taylor said.
“I think it’s important to have people
from different aspects of student life on
the board, and sometimes ﬁghting does
occur. But I think when it is time for
us to act on something, we should al
draw together.” ’
Both candidates discussed what they
felt the role of the SGB president to be.
“He [the president] needs to really be
able to understand the problems of the
student body,” Mumma said. “He
needs to take the problems to the ad-
ministration, get some information, and
actually work on solving them. And I
really think I proved that as a member
of the board, through my activities, and
through my general work, with the
board as a whole.”
Taylor said he was the more qualiﬁed
candidate. ‘ ‘I think I’ve proved this [his

qua1iﬁcation]_ throughout this campaign
and throughout my term on the board
by being one of the most persistent ar-
ticulators of student opinion,” he said.

“I’m ready to fulﬁll the ofﬁce of stu- —

dent government president to the best
of my ability, which I think is-con-
siderable,” Taylor concluded. , _

Craig Spitzer, a junior economics
major at Pitt, commented after the
debate about Dan Taylor’s style: “I

Pitt/ Penn State blood drive begins

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

The Pitt Panthers may not defend the
Penn State Nittany Lions when they
clash for their annual brawl on Nov.
23 at Pitt Stadium, but the Panthers
may still gain a victory on that day.

The winners of the Pitt-Penn State
blood drive challenge will be armounced
before the football game, and Pitt is off
to a good start. V

The blood drive began Monday in

g the Kurtzman Room of the William Pitt
Union and will continue until Wednes- _

' I . '

day, Nov. 20. So far, the Panthers are
leading Penn State.

“We had 93 donors on Monday and
expect the same number today,” said
Pat Jones of the Central Blood Bank.
“As of now, we are ahead of Penn
State.”

If the current pace continues, Pitt"
should be able to outdistance last year’s
total of 3,594 pints. “Our goal is to
have possibly 5,000 pints donated,”
said Marge Brown, director of public
relations for the Central Blood Bank.
“And the need for blood is tremen-
dous.” '

All the blood donated in the drive
will go to the Central Blood Bank,
which serves the 32 Pittsburgh area
hospitals.

“The kids respond real well to the
blood drive, and we should have
another good turnout this year,” said
Jones. “Sometimes we’ve had a prob-
lem with too much enthusiasm.” I

Although most of the students are
giving blood in order to beat Penn
State, some have other reasons. “I
have an hour to kill before classes so
I thought I would give blood,” said Pitt
freshman Eric Schwarz. “But I voted
for Pitt.”

Schultz: ‘deep’ disagreements still exist after meetings

WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State Schultz summed up two days of
talks with Soviet leadership by claim-
ing that some progress has been made,
but “deep” disagreements still exist
between the two superpowers. The pur-
pose of the talks was to narrow details
that will be discussed at the upcoming
Geneva Summit.

Schultz also denied charges that the
CIA kidnapped and held captive for
three months a top member of the
KGB, Vitaly Yurchenko. Yurchenko
claimed that he has never sought
political asylum in the United States.
The State Department said the Soviets
have agreed to another interview with
Yurchenko in the presence of U.S. of-
ﬁcials to conﬁrm that Yurchenko wants
to return to Moscow. Schultz met brief-
ly to discuss the case with Soviet leader
Gorbachev.

Soviet dissident

Massachusetts — Soviet dissident

hunger strike and will travel to the
United States for medical treatment.
The phone call to relatives in Newton,
Mass. was the first conversation held
in six years.

price ‘free-for-all’

Officials within OPEC are denying
statements by one Arab oil minister that
the cartel’s 13 member-nations now are"
free to sell their oil at any price and
may produce any quantities they
please.

Non-OPEC Norway warns that any
such free-for-all would unleash what it
calls “an unprecedented oil price
crash.”

OPEC president Dr. Subroto said
that there are no changes in the cartel’s
official oil prices and individual out-

put quotas. The overall ceiling is now
16 million barrels a day.

These statements counter those made
by the oil minister from the United
Arab Emirates. The minister of the
Emirates said the behavior of non-
OPEC producers left OPEC nations-
free to set their own oil prices.

Soviet ship leaves
despite court appeal

A Federal appeals court refused to
stop a Soviet freighter from leaving
U.S. waters with a sailor who twice
jumped ship near New Orleans. The
Ukrainian-American Bar Association
wanted to keep the seaman in the
United States for interviews to deter-
mine whether he wanted political
asylum. The appellate court was
heeding warnings to avoid an “inter-
national incident.”

Malcolm X widow

Betty Shabazz, widow of slain black
leader Malcolm X, labelled Louis Far-
rakhan an “opportunist.” She said she
regrets the day she met the self-
proclaimed black messiah. The con-

troversial Nation of Islam leader will
be speaking at the University of Pitts-
sburgh on Nov. 14.

Afghanistan — The young Soviet
soldier who entered the U.S. embassy
in Afghanistan left voluntarily in the

The soldier slipped into the embassy

uncertain whether the soldier wanted
to defect or simply leave Afghanistan.
Soviet ofﬁcials agreed not to harm the
19-year-old soldier.

“We are prepared for the events that
night," said Walter Waters, the assis-
tant director of public safety at Pitt.
“Our job is to protect all Pitt speakers.
We will have extra manpower. City
police will come to campus if the prob-
lem gets out of hand.”

“We do not plan to demonstrate,”
said Rabbi Joseph Levine, the director
of the B’nai B’rith Hillel, a Jewish
organization at Pitt. “We see ourselves
as academic people. We are peace-
loving people who plan to make peo-
ple aware of what’s going on.”

Levine said the invitation to Far-
rakhan is unfortunate because of Far-
rakhan’s “controversial” speeches.
“There are a number of other black
leaders who could have spoken at Pitt
instead of Rev. Farrakhan,” he said.

Despite the controversy, Levine and
his group will attend Farrakhan’s
speech. “We just have to listen to what
he has to say and what his position is,”
he said. “We need to come together.
Our communities, black and Jewish,
need to support each other.”

While the controversy continues
about Farrakhan, the Black Action
Society, the sponsor of the Farrakhan
visit, defends the decision to bring Far-
rakhan to Pitt.

“We are excited about Farrakhan’s

coming here,” said Camille Y. White,’
the deputy chainnan of BAS. The
20-year-old senior argued that after she
watched the video provided by the Na-
tion of Islam of Farrakhan’s past
speeches, she was convinced that the
minister’s presence on the Pitt campus

will become very important.

“I had the opportunity to find out
what he represents after watching his
video. He does not represent anti-
Semitism as alleged, but he does repre-
sent a strong black society,” she ex-
plained. White, a political science and
communication major, said she was
convinced that the controversy about
Farrakhan is nothing but “prejudice.”

“People are against him because he
is a true black leader who represents
a change in black community,” White
said. “He represents redemption and
uniﬁcation. His critics don’t want
that.” .

In defense of the action of BAS in
bringing Farrakhan to Pitt, White said,
“BAS has the right to invite any
speaker it pleases to the campus.
Nobody can dictate to us who and who
not to invite. People don’t have to come

if it bothers them that much — they

have the freedom of choice just as Rev.

Farrakhan has freedom of speech.”

president of the Student Government
Board.

Kluchko said he does not regret the
decision he made: “The university said
our decision is the best and the fairest.
We have the university’s support."

In his State of the Pitt Union address
in March, Kluchko said, “Freedom of
expression is not merely the personal
right of individuals to have his or her
say. It also means the right for the rest
of us to hear him.” In the final part of
his address, Kluchko stated: “Allow-

ing the Rev. Farrakhan the opportuni-
ty to speak here at the University of
Pittsburgh can be a very positive
thing."

President Wesley Posvar advises the
entire student body to maintain peace
before, during and after Farrakhan’s
speech.

“Those who object to Rev. Far-
rakhan’s view should attend the speech
peacefully or stay away,” he said.

Third, the bottom line to all this
nonsense is the same thing that occurred
when Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey and
Dr. Martin Luther King were at the
forefront of the African-American
struggle. White America does not want

You hate to hear the truth because
it hurts. Farrakhan is telling the truth.
This is why he is catching all the hell
that he is today. He is going against the
popular version of truth. This is why
he is so controversial. Dissect the
word controversy. Look at its Latin

roots, and you’ll see exactly what con-
troversy means. Remember that
Christopher Columbus was controver-
sial. He went against the popular ver-
sion of truth in that the world was
round rather than ﬂat, but history
stands on the side of Columbus.

The Pitt News, November 6, 1985'

View From Capital Hill/ CongressnfalTGus Savage

The White  Media and Minister Louis Farrakhan

A black reporter for a white, weekly
news magazine phoned me in
Washington recently. His question was
the same as that asked most- black
members of Congress and other na-
tionally prominent Blacks by news
reporters for white media during the

past few weeks: “What about Far-

rakhan? ”

Since I knew this black reporter from
hisdays in Chicago, I didn’t return
with profanity the insult his question
represented to me, as I have to white
racist reporters. I merely told him he
should be ashamed to permit his white
racist editors to put him up to taking
advantage of his black contacts.

Well, now, what about Farrakhan? I

When President Reagan lied about
MIG-14 Soviet ﬁghter jets being im-
ported by Nicaragua, I visited there
and, of course, there were none —-— but
that white weekly news magazine
didn’t assign its black reporter to in-
terview me regarding my’ findings‘
there, and Nicaragua certainlywas hot
news at that time.‘ Yet, it published in-
terviews of _white_congressmen who
spent less time in Nicaragua than did
I, congressmen who hadn’t even talked
with Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega, as I did for more than two
hours. '

Last August I headed a fact-ﬁnding,

' two-week mission to the Soviet Union,

but that black reporter’s white editors
didn’t assign him to ask me about my

findings then. '

What about Farrkahan?

In the past four and a half years I
have visited 26 nations, on six con-
tinents or regions of the world, but I
have never recieved a phone call from
any reporter of the white media about
any of my ﬁndings, although I was
traveling with U.S. diplomatic status.
status. _

I protested in Johannesburg, South
Africa — and it was shown even on
South African newspapers, as well as
in newspapers in liberated parts of
Africa — but I never received a call

from the white media of my own -

nation.
I have met with then Prime Minister
Menachim Begin, in Israel, and PLO

leader Yassir Arafat, in Tunisia. I have
been in the PLO’s headquarters that
was recently bombed by the American-'
supplied Israeli air force, met with

Saudi Arabia, Presidents Mubarak of
Egypt, Assad of Syria and Gemayel of
Lebanon. I have visited the battle zones
of Beirut and Angola, investigated, on
the scene, our invasion of Grenada.
our invasion of Grenada.

But no reporter from the. white media
called me when I returned home.
What about Farrakhan?

Renewed Hopeandthe Promise of Success

For the last week or two, I have been

mulling over adecision that could af-
fect my life for at least the next year.
For that reason, I have been doing my
research, looking through magazine
ads (especially the airline magazines)
to see what’s available and, of course,
conferring with people who know
something about the subject. I am
thinking of changing appointment
books.

My present appointment book has let

_me down. The year has not gone as

well as expected, and try as I might,
I have been unable to organize my life
the way I think I should. Although I
have written about 150 columns, a few
magazine articles and been insulted on-
ly twice by Robert Novak on national
television, I have thelingering feeling
that with a better appointment book, I
could be better organized, more pro-
ductive, richer and therefore (it says
here) happier.

.would be different.

This, I’m sure, IS a feeling left over
from school days. Then, I looked_for-
ward to starting the school year with
fresh notebooks. I used. to take those
notebooks home and just stare at their
virgin pages — a vast prairie of
unlimited (although lined) horizons

' which promised, like the frontier itself,
a fresh start. I would look at those
pages and vow that the coming year

I would be
disciplined. My notebooks would be
organized and neat and, it went without
saying, always be up to date, just brim-
ming with homework assignments
completed on time. In short, I would
‘no longer be me. When you’re young,

fa ' clean notebook offers more
possibilities than psychotherapy.

No miracles ever transpired, of

course. For maybe a week, I had a=

perfect notebook, clean and neat with
all the tabs in place and no doodling in
the margins. Then life would over-

whelm me. Friends would demand that
I play with them. The television set
would lure me with incredible pro-
grams that just had to be watched that
instant. Fantasies and daydreams would
intrude into my workday. Without even
knowing it, I would be transported to
a far, far better world where, as acrime
ﬁghter, I was a hero and where,

-routinely, I astounded the sports world

with my feats. I held many, many
world records.

Of course, my notebooks would suf-
fer. After a while, they would be miss-
ing pages, and my neat little sections
— math here, geometry there — would
run into each other like foods on a
plate. Occasionally, I would make a
desperate attempt to bring order out of
chaos,_ but usually it was impossible —
too big a task for a mere human being,
even one with so many world records
to his credit. Page after page would fall

‘out, to be retrieved from the ground

and then stuffed into a pocket or desk
where, mysteriously, it could never be
found.

But the wonderful thing about school
was that, like sports, there was always
next year. It promised renewal. In a
sense, the new, crispy-blank notebooks
were only symbolic of the true fresh
start school itself offered. Every year,
new teachers. Every year, someone who
did not know how you did last year.
Every year, someone whose mind was
not already made up about you, who
for a couple of weeks at least had no

idea you were different, who did not ’

know you were worse than dumb,
worse than stupid, but a genuine
underachiever, and who — and this is
the best part — had never heard your
repertoire of excuses and did not know
therefore that your grandmother was
already dead. May she again rest in
peace.

Life (which is to say “ work”) is not

like that at all. Every year, the'same
boss. Every year, the same supervisor.
There’s a book on you — charts,
forms, evaluations, word of mouth,

gossip. The frontier has closed, and-

with it has gone its promise of a fresh
start. Your bosses know who you are
and know that your grandmother is
already dead (at least once). They know
about the quality of your work and your
work habits, and even if you quit and
go somewhere else, their malicious
evaluations will, like killer bees slow-
ly working their way north, eventual-
ly catch up to you. '
So the only thing that‘s left for most
of us are these desk diaries. They are
our notebooks, assignment books,
workbooks and everything else rolle
into one. s
F. Scott Fitzgerald said there are no
second acts in American life, and
maybe he’s right. But with the right

_desk diary, at least there's lunch.

Yippie turns yuppie:

Jerry Rubin looks
at life in the 1960s

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

In the fall of 1968, Jerry Rubin was
on trial for conspiracy and crossing
state lines to incite a riot. _In the fall of
1985, he runs a business on Wall
Street.

“Of course I’ve changed over the

.years,” Rubin said in a recent inter-
view with The Pitt News. “People
change every day, so how could I not
change over 20 years? I’ve grown. I’ve
matured. I’ve changed my mind about
a few things.” .

Jerry Rubin is not one to deny the
ever-passing parade of years and the ef-
fect that time can have on even the most

Vdie-hard radical. Currently on a debate

r tour with Abbie Hoffman that will take
him to Pitt tomorrow night, Rubin has
become a full-ﬂedged member of the
establishment he fought so hard against
in the 1960s. Along with dropping the
idealistic language of the 1960s, he has
also dropped from his list of friends
one-time ally Abbie Hoffman.

Don't be.

622-6982

“Of course I’ve changed
over the years. People change
everyday, so how could I not
change over 20 years?”

— Jerry Rubin

“I don’t. get along with Abbie very
well,” Rubin said of Hoffman, whom
he considers a leftover from the ’60s.
“He’s tough to get along with.”

Rubin came to the attention of the
public during the mid-1960s when he
began organizing anti-Vietnam War
rallies. Before that, he was a student,
businessman and a reporter for a
newspaper in Cincinnati. Which of
those is the real Jerry Rubin?

“Each one is the real Jerry Rubin,”
he said. “I agree with what Shirley
MacLaine said — that under our bodies
are our spirits, and we have many dif-
ferent incarnations.”

Pitt appoints

legal counsel

' The University of Pittsburgh recently
announced that Lewis M. Popper, a
38-year-old partner in the Washington,
D.C. law firm of Wald, Harkrader &
Ross, has been appointed university
counsel effective Dec. 1.

The university counsel, the univer-
sity’s chief legal ofﬁcer, is responsi-
ble for all university legal matters and
serves as the principal legal adviser to
the president, the adrninstrative staff
and the board of trustees. .

Popper is a 1968 magna cum laud
graduate of Harvard College. He
earned his law degree at Harvard in
1971., After law school,_ Popper was
named deputy. attorney general of the
state of New Jersey, representing the
state’s Department of Education and
Department of Higher Education. In
that position he handled a wide range
of legal issues concerning higher
education, including legislation and
also litigation in labor, First Amend-
ment and financial matters. In private
practice he has represented colleges
and universities and higher education
associations.

“We are extremely pleased that a
person of Lewis Popper’s experience
and stature has accepted this important
post,” commented President Wesley
W. Posvar. “The university counsel
works very closely with other univer-
sity administrators as well as our facul-
ty and trustees. We feel that by virtue
of his outstanding academic
background and his professional
achievements and expertise, Mr. Pop-
per is ideally suited to handle the
diverse duties associated with this vital
and sensitive position.”

At Pitt, Popper will report to Ex-
ecutive Vice President Jack E.
Freeman and supervise a staff of four
full-time lawyers. He will review all
legal matters involving the university,
its various units and affiliates and will
advise the administration and board of
trustees on such matters.

The university counsel also provides
legal counsel to several corporations af-
filiated with the universityand directs
the work of outside law ﬁrms engaged
by the university.

Popper succeeds David Sullivan,
who served in that capacity from 1982
to April 1985, when he resigned to ac-
cept a position in industry. Ronald F.
Talarico, assistant university counsel,
has been serving as interim counsel
since April.

Both Posvar and Freeman expressed
gratitude to Talarico for his handling
of the duties of university counsel for
the past six months. “We are most for-
tunate that a person of Ron Talarico’s
talent and experience was willing and
able to assume those duties on short
notice,” Freeman said. “He handled
a very difficult assignment with the ut-
most professional skill and dedica-
tion.”

Popper is married and currently lives
with his" wife and three children in
Chevy Chase, Md. ‘His law firm is the
eighth largest in.Washington, D.C.

I seek the position of Student Government President because I feel that my»ex-
perience as a member of the 4985 Student Government Board has provided me
with the skills and the experience to fairly represent the student body at Pitt. My
term on the Board was dedicated to increasing involvement through the Senate
Committees, the Freshman Council, and the Student Assembly. I would strongly
encourage the continuation of the professional attitude of this year's Board, which
has allowed us to work with the administration in accomplishing many of our
goals. It is my belief that the Student Government Board exists not only to pro-
mote and represent the students of Pitt at the national level (where student issues
are involved),but most importantly to find viable solutions to the problems and
concerns existing on campus that affect us here and now. As President, I would
concentrate the efforts of the Board toward improving the condition of the stu-
dent body as a whole by addressing issues from and open minded, yet realistic
viewpoint.

action.

I am running for SGB President because I feel that I am highly qualified for the
position. I have many good ideas and the leadership abilities to put them into

I am an active member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, where I have served
as Rush Chairman and am currently the 1986 Greek Week Chairman.'| have serv-
ed on the Governmental Relations Committee of SGB. and in 4984, I was elected
to my current position on the SGB . — '

As a Board Member, I havetravelled to Harrisburg to lobby for state funding
for Pitt. I have provided students with LSAT, MCAT, and GMAT prep courses on
campus at a discount. I have also tackled the one issue that comes up every
year; right now I am working out the details of an all-night study area during mid-
terms and finals. It will not be an issue next year.

I believe that the SGB President should be more than a cheerleader. As my
record shows, I am not afraid to take a stand and make a stand on critical issues.
This University is, among other things, a business. Sometimes, what is good for
business is not good for students. As SGB President, I would work to make sure
that today's students aren't paying for tomorrow's business.

I ask that you allow me to continue to work for you as SGB President.

Robert D. Ardizzl
I see the Student Government Board as the represen-
tative voice of the student body. Therefore, my main ob-
jective in running for the Board is to help student govern-

- ment become more directly representative of student

wishes; including organizing an open student forum
where students may bring problems and suggestions
before a panel of Board members. In addition, I would
like to see closer ties between the Board and the other
student organizations, so that all problems may be
resolved quickly and efficiently.

Another area which needs to be addressed deals with

' commuters. I would like to see University parking costs

reduced, as well as having the University take steps to
improve the quality of off-campu_s housing through
meetings with area realtors. Lastly, I would like to see
some movement on current tabled issues that have a
direct effect on students, such as cable television in the
dormitories. I am a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, where I served as Vice-President. I feel that this
past experience will help me a great deal if I am elected
to the Board. I am a sophomore and a Political Science
major. -

Glenn Cooper

Being a student in a large university, I see the problems
that arise between students and the administration. I feel
that it is the Student Government's responsibility to ad-
dress these problems and work with both the students
and the administration to organize and implement a
proper solution.

I feel that one of the major issues that needs to be ad-
dressed is student involvement and participation. I feel
that this can be accomplished by an increased support
from Student Government to Pitt3s' many different
organizations and ‘student groups. Whether we are deal-'
ing with Nursing, Engineering, or the Greek System, it is
Student Government's primary purpose to back these in-
terests. One incident that could have used more support
was last year's controversy over raising the tuition for
Pharmacy students. Issues like this need and deserve
support from the student population along with the Stu-
dent Government Board.

_I believe that the students must communicate with the
Student Government Board so that the Board can do
what is necessary to best help the students. In this respect
I feel that I can do the best possible job.

James Garboden

My attention will be directed towards continuing the
progress of solidifying relations between the student
body and the administration of the University. A lot of pro-
gress has been made. but truly more work needs to be
done. The administration needs to realize the fact the
the student body is the vital part of the Univeristy and
has to be recognized as such.

Being Chairman of the Freshman Council last year, I
found a lot of my attention was turned toward helping
the Board members with their different projects. Basically
I worked on the end of finding out what the students
wanted. One of the bigger things I was a part of last year
was the survey to see how the students felt about library
hours during finals. I got the experience of working with
Board members and was able to get out to the students
and see what they wanted the Board members to do.
This experience has given me the ability to know how
the Board runs and how much work must be put into the

_ job.

During my two years at the University of Pittsburgh I
have passively observed many problems confronting the
student body. That is going to change. I am confident
I can make necessary improvements.

would be actual experiences of renters with certain
landlords.

Although I now live in an Oakland apartment, I com- I

muted my first year and am quite aware of the problems
of the commuters. Parking probably heads the list, so I
will try to expand available parking locations. Like many
commuters, I attended classes in the morning and went
home in the early afternoon without getting involved in
student activities. Therefore I am going to make an ef-
fort to get commuters more involved in student life.
Last year I had the opportunity to work in the Provost's
Office where I became knowledgeable of the ad-
ministrative process. Therefore, I feel I will have an edge
when I discuss problems with administrative officials.
Finally, I want to be elected to get things accomplish-

. ed -- not simply to hold a title as a board member.

Andy Bacallao

Involvement by the student body is crucial to the ef-
fectiveness of the Student Government. Attitudes and
needs of the students must be collectively addressed to
the faculty and administration of our University.

As a student who has lived both on and off. campus,
I have experienced the problems of both types of en-
vironment. Providing information to students, both on
and off campus, is difficult and needs to be improved.
The current problem of inadequate housing for students
needs to be emphasized to the administration for future
action. Restructuring of the lottery system and help by
the University in finding off-campus housing need to be
reviewed.

I am presently 6: CAS student studying for a degree in
Political Science and Economics. I am a diligent worker
who believes that persistence leads to success. Here at
the University, I have participated in the Emerging
Leader Program, which instructed me in the effective use
of my organizational and motivational skills within
leadership positions.

If elected to Student Government Board, I will strive to
make my contributions beneficial to the student body

as 0 whole.
Mary Fﬁtis

The quality of student life at the University of Pittsburgh
will improve it I am elected to the Student Government
Board. Between the extreme monetary loss encountered
by those students who sell back used books, and the in-
comprehensible English spoken by too many of our pro-
fessors and T.A.'s, and the negligent distribution of your
student activities fee, and the non-representation in our
administration, the quality of student life here at the
University of Pittsburgh is far below par.

In order to change the system as it stands, we need

dedicated, responsible, and--"motivated individuals='on I
our Student Government Board.’ Because the issues

presented directly hinder the quality of my own student
life, I understand the need to bring about change. I am
sincerely dedicated to our cause, and proven respon-
sible through previous involvements, and am extreme-
ly motivated with an urgency for change.

If I am elected to the Student Government Board, my
qualifications will allow me to rectify our current
situation '

Jay Rothstein

Many students at the University of Pittsburgh are virtual-
ly unaware of the opportunities available to them. As a
prospective member of Student Government, my goal
is to promote an awareness of these opportunites to the
student body. This can be accomplished by creating a
better relationship between Student Government and
campus students, residents and commuters as well.

If elected, I will try to keep students well informed and
extablish an active participation by the students in their
government. New opinions and intelligent suggestions
will be readily acknowledged and reviewed. By voting
in this election, you can make a choice for a more ac-
tive, informative involvement in your government here
at the University of Pittsburgh. -

Melanie Naro .
I am a sophomore student majoring in Political Science
and Philosophy. After I am graduated, I plan to attend
Law School, practice law, and eventually to become ac-
tive in politics.

At the University I have been actively involved in
various campus activities, which include the Freshman
Council, the Pre-law Society, and the Pitt Program Coun-
cil. Last year I volunteered for thesAllegheny County

Republican Party. I am also a sister of Chi Omega.

Fraternity.

If elected to the Student Government Board, my top
priority is to find a twenty-four hour~study area. I believe
Hillman Library hours should be re-evaluated. Also if
elected, I hope to initiate a student awareness of the
noise level in Hillman Library.

Other goals that I hope to initiate would be a re-
analyzation of the cafeteria, which would include the
menu and alternative snack shops where meal tickets
could be used.

Also, the University of Pittsburgh will be celebrating its
bicentennial beginning next fall. If elected, I hope to
make every student aware of the importance of this

‘celebration, and to get every student involved.

 

David Konkolics

The reasons for my candidacy to Student Government
Board is that I wish to enhance student awareness of
University policies and issues, and to further the progress
of the previous administration. I would like to have more
rallies pertaining to national issues of interest to the
students. The Apartheid rallies are a good thing. It lets
students get involved with important issues, and hopeful-
ly influences its outcome. I would like to have more of
these rallies with Issues such as "Nuclear disarmament"
and “World terrorism". More pep rallies could be useful
in combating student apathy. I think more public rela-
tions are needed to help lift student spirit. For example,
plastering slogans such as“‘#‘I Univeristy in the #1 City
-- Pitt" in local newspapers and on local billboards. I
think it is important for students to get a full college
education, and that includes learning more than what
can be found in the classroom!

Monique Sims

My reason for wanting to be an SGB member is
because I feel that l have the leadership potential and
capabilities that it takes to fulfill the position giving 100%
dedication. I feel that I can be an asset to the SGB by
keeping them informed and up-to-date about the ideas
and opinions of the student body here at Pitt, and vice-
versa. I have also had previous experience in Student
Government in high school for 2 years and in my senior
year, I was Vice-President of The National Honor Society.

My motivation in wanting to be on the Board is the fact
that I have talked to students on campus here, and most
of them feel as though they don't have a voice in the
decision making process that inevitably affects them in
the long run. I've also known how important it is to have
communication lines clear and open in keeping pro-
blems down to a minimum. Hopefully. it voted in and
elected, I can be a useful instrument for both parties.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe my
reasons and motivation all stem from the challenge of
being a dedicated. open-minded, intelligent SGB
member in which I can definitely do. giving 100% of
myself.

Thank ou.

Amy Unks
I think that my involvement in Student Government will
be an asset to the relationship between the students, the
Student Government Board and the administration. be-

ing an outgoing person, I feel that I would be able to.

listen to the students’ problems and present them to the
administration in the most productive way.

I feel that student involvement is the key to a well-
running university. A school as heterogeneous and large
as the University of Pittsburgh needs to stress student in-
volvement. I was very happy to see the Senate Commit-
tee stressed more last year and hope to keep this going
in the year to come.

The housing system here at Pitt, I feel, must be examin-
ed more closely. A center to help the students who do
not receive housing find apartments should be set up
and working in full-force for the protection of the students.
Being one of those students, I know the hardships of liv-
ing off campus and paying outrageous rents to crook-
ed landlords. With a center of this sort, these problems
could be dealt with head on.

Lastly, I feel that Student Government can use an en-
thusiastic, willing to work person.‘I know I am that person.

 Is education the

By Kelly I. Shaffer
The Pitt News

AIDS: It kills thousands and terriﬁes
millions. Acquired Immune Deﬁcien-
cy Syndrome, or AIDS, has become
known as the plague of the 80s.

AIDS is changing our perceptions of
certain segments of our society, our
sexual habits and our lifestyles.

In Los Angeles, apartment owners
worry about leasing to homosexuals.
In Miami, patients increasingly ask
their dentists to wear gloves. All over
the United States, bar owners have
noticed a trend; the bars are either
“gay” bars or “straight” bars.

Researches estimate that sexual pro-
miscuity has lessened within the last
two years and new regulations are be-
ing instituted in public bathhouses.

AIDS and its victims are the objects

. of society’s hysterical fear.

Since its discovery in the United
States in 1981, approximately 14,000
cases of AIDS have been documented.
Researchers estimate that the number
of the disease’s victims doubles every
year, with a mortality rate of 40 to 50
percent. A ‘

AIDS is characterized by a defect in
the body’s natural immunity system.
This leaves the AIDS victim open to
infection by certain types of
pnuemonias and cancers.

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, an
infection of the lungs, and a rare type
of cancer called Kaposi’s Sarcoma are
only two of the fatal diseases that af-
ﬂict 85 percent of AIDS victims.

The virus HTLV-HI is considered to
be the cause of AIDS. HTLV-III was
discovered in France in 1983, two
years after the first case of AIDS was
identiﬁed in the United States.

One can be infected with the vims
HTLV-HI and not get AIDS. Dr. N.
Mark Richards of the Allegheny Coun-

ty Health Department estimates that 15 ‘
to 20 percent of the infected individuals’

actually get sick.

The average incubation period for
the disease is four to five years.
Therefore a person could be infected
with HTLV-HI now and not know it
until months or even years from now
when he develops the symptoms of
AIDS.

At this time, there is no cure for
AIDS. Researchers all over the world
are organizing and collating informa-
tion gathered from studies directed by
the World Health Organization. Agen-
cies such as the Atlanta Center for
Disease Control and the University of
Pittsburgh’s Men’s Study Group are

—a

“I don ’t think their civil
rights should be com-
promised because they

have AIDS. ”
—- Steve Kilbert
Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force

working to find not only the cure for
the disease, but the cause of it.

It is this lack of knowledge about the
disease that is causing a furor
throughout the country. People who
only know that people are dying, not
why or how, are beginning to worry
about their own safety and that of their
children. With Rock Hudson’s death
and a ﬂood of media attention, AIDS
has come to be one of the most talked
about subjects of our time.

However, with information about the
disease being so scarce, most of the talk
is ﬁction, not fact.

Our society has become almost
paranoid about being able to catch the
disease; with misinformation so readily
available and correct facts so difﬁcult
to discern, it is no wonder.

' One group that has made its opinions
on the transmission of AIDS very audi-
ble is the National Democratic Policy
Committee. While standing on street
corners and at booths on college cam-
puses, this group of people is warning
others of the contagiousness of AIDS.

Carol Brown, a member of the Na-
tional Democratic Policy Committee,
stated that from their interpretation of
the studies done on AIDS: “We have
been lied to by the Atlanta Center For
Disease Control. They say that we can
only catch AIDS from sexual contact,
dirty needles and contaminated blood.
That isn’t true.

“We know that studies that have
been done showing that AIDS is
transmitted through sex, blood transfu-
sions, coughing and sneezing and every
single body ﬂuid — including sweat,
saliva and tears. Dr. Mark Whiteside
at the Institute of Tropical Diseases in
Miami, Florida, did a study of a com-
munity called ‘Belle Glades.’ He found
that 20 percent of the town’s popula-
tion had AIDS. It was not because of
homosexuals, but he believes that it
was through insects and the third-world
conditions that exist in Belle Glades, ’ ’
stated Brown._

Pitt AIDS researcher pursues
cure, compassion and confidentiality

Assistant News Editor

Dr. Charles Rinaldo, director of the
University of Pittsburgh’s AIDS
research program, has mixed emotions
about the study of AIDS.

“As a scientist, AIDS research is a
very exciting ﬁeld to be in right now,”
said Rinaldo, associate professor of
pathology at the Graduate School of
Public Health. “However, for a com-
passionate person working with the gay
community, it is a very devastating and
terrible disease, and it has to be studied
intensely to develop an understanding
of the disease. Once understood, we
can ﬁnd adequate and universal ways
to attack the disease.”

AIDS, or acquired immune deﬁcien-
cy syndrome, is a disease that attacks
the immune system, l_eaving the body

defenseless against various viral infec-
tions including pneumonias and certain
rare cancers. ‘

“It’s a new virus infection which,

~ when it causes AIDS, kills over 50 per-

cent of the victims,” said Rinaldo.
“Most viruses don't have such a high
rate of death, and it is important to
understand the natural history of the
virus.”

In order the gain a better understand-
ing of AIDS, the research program has
recruited 1,600 homosexual men from
the Pittsburgh area. These volunteers
must complete an extensive personal
questionnaire and must also go through
a series of complex tests that include
getting samples of blood and semen.

“A critical aspect of our research has
been the access to and support by the
gay community,” said Rinaldo.
“They’re all volunteers, and they’ve
had to go through this ordeal of testing

  

  

and ﬁlling out lengthy questionnaires,
and we couldn't do it without their sup-
port.”

However, the volunteers from Pitts-
burgh’s homosexual community just
didn't walk through the doors of the
Public Health Building. In order to
convince them, the members of the
research program put out adver-
tisements and went to places frequented
by homosexuals. “We went out and
spent many hours in the gay communi-
ty,” said Rinaldo, “and we recruited
many from gay bars and baths.”

“We had to be very aggressive in our
recruitment,” he continued. “We
advertised in gay newspapers and even
put an ad on PAT buses.”

However, heavy recruiting was still
not enough to convince many homosex-
uals to undergo the testing. “A major
part of our tests is conﬁdentiality, ’ ’ said

College women consider abortion
as solution to unplanned pregnancy

Editor ’s Note: The following article is
the second in a series examining the
issues and alternatives of college
pregnancy.

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

The room is large, airy and crowd-
ed. The walls are white and the chairs
blue — metal, vinyl and lined up along
the perimeter of the room. There are
plants and magazines and a framed
poster in the corner of the room:
“Tomorrow is the first day of the rest
of your life.”

About 50 women a week visit this .

room, the waiting room at Allegheny
Women’s Center. Some come alone,
some with friends, but all come to wait
and to make a decision. The decision
is one of the biggest in their lives. The
decision is abortion.

During 1985, 1.5 million women
will decide on abortion as the solution
to their unwanted pregnancies, (16,000
in Allegheny county alone) and the
largest percentage of these women fall
between the ages of 20 and 24 — col-
lege women.

In a recent survey conducted by the
Allegheny Reproductive Health
Center, they found 41 percent of their
abortion patients to be between the ages
of 20 and 24, 67 percent to be single,
and 51 percent to be pregnant for the
ﬁrst time.

Pregnancy has recently become a
college issue; the women of this
category are among those at the highest
risk of experiencing an unplanned
pregnancy.

“This group is a target population,”
said Janet Catov of the Women’s
Health Service. “It bafﬂes people.
They think that it isn’t the same issue
it is for minors, but it is.”

The decision to treat an unplanned

“There are always other issues, but the main one is
ﬁnancial. College kids are poor. They have sacriﬁced
a lot already to go to college. These women have delayed
initial gratiﬁcation to get there, and they are not going

to give it up. ”

——Jeanne Clark
Executive Director

Allegheny Women ’s Center

pregnancy, to say the least, is not an
easy one. Although abortion as one of
the alternatives seems to many to be the

easiest, it is also the most publically

scrutinized and controversial choice.
Plagued still with religious and political
debates and battles over the control of
female biology, the abortion issue has
been reared largely in the public
domain.

But as the political smoke clears and
pregnancy becomes a reality, abortion
becomes a personal decision, and the
woman is the only one who can make
it. People, politics and partners aside,
it is her life that must absorb the reper-
cussions of pregnancy. But how does
she make the right decision? _

“You can’t make a wrong decision
as long as you are the one making it, ”
said Jeanne Clard, executive director
of the Allegheny Women’s Center. She
councils women from colleges across
the state each day, helping them with
their pregnancy decisions.

“This is a life-enhancing decision for
the woman,”said Clark. “She is tak-
ing control of her own life. This may
be the first time in her life that she is
making her own decision.”

According to Clark, the decision to
have an abortion in college is primari-
ly a financial one. “There are always
other issues, but the main one is ﬁnan-
cial.” said Clark. “College kids are

poor. They have sacriﬁced a lot already
to go to college. These women have
delayed initial gratiﬁcation to get there,
and they are not going to give it up."

Timing also has a lot to do with it,
according to Dayna Jomsay, education
coordinator for Pittsburgh Planned
Parenthood. ‘ ‘Abortion is not
something a woman thinks about until
she is faced with the decision, and a lot
of times it’s just not the right time or
place to have a child.”

This was the case for “Julie,” who
prefers not to be identiﬁed. She was
majoring in business at Pitt, planning
a career in marketing and happy in her
relationship. All of a sudden, there she
was with a missed period", a positive
pregnancy test, a potential baby and no
place in her life for a child.

“Having an abortion was the only
thing I could consider at that time in
my life, especially in tenns of my rela-
tionship with my boyfriend,” said
Julie. “We were only going together
a short time, and we were both very
active. Abortion seemed like the
quickest and easiest thing to do.”

At most Pittsburgh health centers that
handle abortions, an afﬁrmed pregnan-
cy test can result in an abortion as car-
ly as a week later. The accessibility of
abortions and the immediate results
make it an attractive alternative,
especially to college women who are

 

L

considering midterm grades, tuition
bills and family disapproval, along with
a potential child.

“The accessibility of legal abortion
deﬁnitely inﬂuenced my decision to get
an abortion,” said Julie. “I guess it
would seem as if I’m pro-life. Unfor-
tunately, if I did become pregnant this
very minute, I ’d probably get an abor-
tion because it's so damn easy."

Cheryl Miller, nursing superinten-
dent of Pitt‘s Health Center, is

sometimes uncomfortable with the ease
and haste in which college women
seem to make their pregnancy
decisions.

“I think college women need to think
about their decisions more. Make a
decision — don‘tjust fall into an abor-
tion,” said Miller. “A lot of women
make the decision to get an abortion the

A same day they get the positive pregnan-

cy test. They want to get it over with

AIDS

continued from page 9

“Our theory that AIDS is transmit-
ted through body ﬂuids comes to us
from experiments done by Dr. John
Scale in Britain,” stated Brown.

The NDPC’s theories of the spread
of AIDS stress the fact that “third-
world conditions are the breeding

grounds for AIDS.” The NDPC has.

drawn up a resolution which they will
— and have — presented to various
PTAs, city councils and leading
organizations within communities.
The resolution basically has four
points: “We want mandatory AIDS
testing for all food and health services
employees, and for anyone else who
works with kids or the public. We want
AIDS hospitals to be built, with

I research facilities so that volunteers

could try out new cures as they are
found. We want the government to
commit to spending money to ﬁnd the
cure for AIDS and for building the
AIDS hospitals. We also want to
reverse the economic living structure
all over the world. If we upgrade the
standard of living of the average
American, then the breeding places of
the disease will disappear,” stated
‘Brown.

‘ ‘In the Belle Glades case, there was
a disproportionate amount of AIDS pa-
tients compared with the overall
population. However, there was no
direct evidence for or against the theory
of mosquito transmission,” stated Dr.
Charles Rinaldo, the principal in-
vestigator of the Pitt Men’s Study
Group.

“Mosquitos would not attack a select
population such as the homosexual
population. They don’t know the dif-
ference between the homosexual and
the heterosexual,” explained Dr.
Rinaldo.

“The only Third World [region] that
has a large proportion of AIDS victims
is Africa. Countries in South America,
which are considered to be Third
World, have a low AIDS-incidence

ﬁr.»

‘ ‘I don ’t think that their
civil rights have to be com-
promised because they‘
have AIDS. People with
AIDS are so angry and
frustrated — social
ostracism and the medical
profession treating you
like a guinea pig. When
you start quarantining
AIDS victims, where are
you going to stop? Who
knows who the next ‘un-
safe’ ones will be?”

Force

rate,” stated Rinaldo. “Research has
shown that the AIDS cases in Africa
have been similar to those in the United
States —sexually transmitted,” stated
Rinaldo.

The theory that AIDS can be
transmitted by coughing, sneezing, etc.
is discouraged by ofﬁcial research.

The Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta indicates that AIDS has spread
only through intimate sexual contact,
use of a contaminated needle or
transfusion of blood containing the
virus.

According to The New York Times,
federal medical experts do not attribute
any of the known cases of AIDS to non-
sexual contact with infected in-
dividuals. This eliminates contracting
AIDS from working or living in the
same area. Federal officials have ad-
vised against open-mouthed kissing and

suggest care when handling any secre-
tions of an AIDS victim.

The NDPC is advocating the isola-
tion of all AIDS victims. Steve Kibert,
a board member of the Pitt AIDS Task
Force, rejects the idea of that practice.
“I don’t think their civil rights should
be compromised because they have
AIDS,” stated Kibert.

“People with AIDS are so angry and
frustrated — the social ostracism and
the medical community treating you
like a guinea pig. If you start quaran-
tining AIDS victims, where will it
stop? Who will be the next ‘unsafe’
ones?” asked Kibert.

The separation of AIDS victims from
the mainstream of society is a crucial

issue in the educational ﬁelds. Across

the United States, children have been
taken out of school because of their
afﬂiction.

Now college -campuses will have to
make some decisions: Will they allow
AIDS victims to attend classes? Live
in dorms? Participate in atheletics?

The American College Health
Association has issued a statement say-
ing that there is no reason “to exclude
AIDS victims or carriers from campus
academic, social or cultural activities.”
They stated that housing decisionswere
to be made on an individual basis.

So campuses such as Pitt are gather-

ing information from studies and task‘

forces in order to make the best deci-
sion.
As people become more aware of the

threat that AIDS poses, they will have
to make changes in their lifestyles to
account for that threat. Some will
become monogamous, others will take
extra care in their sexual activities. But
most importantly, they will be learn-
ing about AIDS and how the spread of
this disease can be slowed — by
education.

Hospitals and groups such as the
Pittsburgh Task Force are
disseminating information to the public
and to potential AIDS victims. The
Center For Disease Control in Atlanta
makes public all its findings, as does
most research facilities.

“Instead of preying on people’s
fears, we should be educating them,”
stated Steve Kibert.

Rinaldo. “The gay community is a
group under extreme pressure and
threat from society, and as a result they
are not open about their lifestyle.”

As a result, the research program ob-
tained a conﬁdentiality certiﬁcate from
the U.S. government. “The certificate
protects our study and the information
we gather from encroachment from any
government or non-government agen-
Cy,” said Rinaldo. “So far, though, we
haven’t had to test it.”

Rinaldo became involved with AIDS
research through his work with herpes
viruses. “When AIDS first hit in 1982,
it was thought that it was caused by
herpes viruses since both involved the
immune system,” he said. “However,
that thought was quickly dismissed —
herpes is not the cause. But since I was
already looking at viruses that interact
with the immune system, it was natural
to progress to AIDS research.”

Since Rinaldo started working with

‘this program, he has not only gained

further insight into the disease but has
also learned more about the group that
it most affects.

“I’ve gotten to know many gay men
in the community who are very
dedicated to ﬁghting AIDS and who are
very concerned about the health of their
friends and loved ones,” he said. “I’m
a pretty open-minded guy, and I think
of the gay community as my friends,
and I feel they think of me as their
friend. I’m helping them combat a
serious disease and am treating them
as equally as I would anyone else.”

Rinaldo has also learned to deal with
the media. “I’ve become more of a
politician,” he said, “and I’ve learned
to say, ‘No comment.’ As a scientist
I like to verbalize, but you have to be
careful with what you say. There is
always the possibility of someone tak-
ing something you say out of context,
so you must be careful. It’s really a
catch-22 situation.”

Although the program is now run-
ning smoothly, there were problems to
overcome. One of the major problems
was gaining access to the gay
community.

“Nothing like this had ever been
done before,” said Rinaldo, “and we
were unsure how to proceed. We need-
ed a go-between for the scientists and
the gay community. We had to develop
an aggressive network in the gay com-
munity.”

Once the contacts were made,
though, there were still problems.
“There was a tremendous problem
with logistics,” said Rinaldo. “We had
to set up roadshows and try to get to
the gays in the gay community. Other
cities who have done this study have
had an easier time getting to the gay
community because the gays are more
prevalent in those cities. In Pittsburgh,
the gay community is not very con-
spicuous.”

However, despite the early prob-
lems, the research program is working
toward an ultimate goal — preventing
AIDS. “We have to find the factors
that may lead to AIDS, and if we ﬁnd
those factors, we can advise the men
on what they can do differently to pre-
vent it,” Rinaldo said. “The factors
may be socially linked or physically
linked or sexually linked.”

One of the ways to advise the men
is through a'sex education program.
“We hope to educate the men closely

* about their sexual activities,” said

Rinaldo. “If we ﬁnd one type of sex-
ual activity is more likely to cause
AIDS, we will tell them not to engage
in that particular act.

‘ “We have analyzed the situation,”
he continued, “and with enough sex
education programs in the gay com-
munity, there should be a signiﬁcant
drop in AIDS in the next four years.

“We are morally and ethically bound
to help these men,” Rinaldo conclud-
ed. “We aren’t just using these men as
objects for scientiﬁc research. Three of
every four gay men are not infected
with AIDS virus and it is up to us to
make sure they don’t contact this
disease. Young men are dying at an
early age, and it is having a tremen-
dous effect on the community, and it
is critical that we ﬁnd out more about
AIDS.” '

Abortion

continued from page I I
out.”

Pat Grimes, executive director of
Alternatives to Abortion, is also con-
cerned with the hastiness of pregnan-
cy decisions. “A lot of college women
seem to be choosing abortion before
knowing all the options,” said Grimes.
“They don’t realize that they can carry
the baby and still get the degree and get
the best of both worlds. They can be
a mother and a career woman."

The role of women is a factor that
ﬁgures predominantly in the political
as well as the personal realm of abor-
tion. In the political arena, the role of
women has become a major point of
division between the pro—choice and the
pro-life movements.

According to recent activist proﬁles,
pro-life activists view the world more
as divided into two spheres — public
and private —- with each sex having an
appropriate natural role, the woman’s
as the mother.

Pro-choice activists, on the other
hand, reject the notion of separate
“proper” life spheres, believing that
women and men are fundamentally
equal, and they see the woman’s
reproductive role as a potential barrier
to equality as long as society renders
motherhood an involuntary act.

According to Clark, abortion in the ‘

personal realm also becomes an issue
of role. “By attending college, and
therefore pursuing a career, college
women have already chosen a role
other than the traditional one,” said

Clark. “So most of these women do
not feel that strongly against abortion.
They are not violating a role.”
Grimes views the female role from
a different perspective. “Whether you
are a career woman or a homemaker,

’ motherhood is not an occupation. It can

ﬁt into either lifestyle and is something
that God chooses, not_us.”

“I’m not a feminist, but I believe that
women should do whatever they want,
whether it be in business, politics or
homemaking,” said Julie. “Personal-
ly, I want a combination of the two.”

The decision to have an abortion, as
any other pregnancy decision, is mixed
with the residues of a relationship and
the issues of sexuality, and for a lot of
women, this decision determines the
plight of the relationship.

“It can work both ways,” Clark
said.. “In some ‘cases, ending the
pregnancy is a way to get out of the
relationship. But usually an unplanned

- pregnancy brings the couples together.

It _forces them to talk about the future.”
the future.”

“For a while we talked about what
the baby would look like and if it would
be spoiled, like me, or sports-loving
like him,” said Julie, recalling the ef-
fects of her abortion on her relation-
ship at the time. “My boyfriend was
the only one who knew about the
pregnancy. I had known for a few
weeks before I told him. I remember
being touched by the way he reacted.
His reaction was sort of like ‘Wow,
there’s a baby inside of you that’s part

of me and part of you.’

In most cases, according to Clark,
women regard their pregnancies as
separate from their relationships. “It
may not be a relationship that they want
to spend the rest of their lives in, but
it’s not an impetus for ending the
pregnancy.”

The decision is made by the woman,
usually based on advice. from her
friends and family. Ninety percent of
the patients at Allegheny Women’s
Center, according to Clark, have their
minds made up when they walk in the
door.

“If the woman is not ready, we can
tell, and we tell her, ‘Go home, you’re
not ready,’ ” said Clark. “I send pa-
tients home to make lists all the time.”

Another factor figuring more
predominantly in the abortion decision
than in any other pregnancy alternative,
is the feeling of guilt, especially
because of sensationalism by pro-life
movements and dramatizations such as
“Silent Scream,” a ﬁlm about the
murder of a potential human being.

According to Clark, guilt is no
longer a problem for many women.
“Women feel guilty about not feeling
guilty more than anything else when
they have an abortion,” said Clark.

Guilt has not yet been a
psychological problem for Julie.
“Often I think that I should feel guil-
ty. To be perfectly honest, I think that
it’s one of those things that is going to
catch up to me later in life. I’m
Catholic, and abortion is a grave sin.

“You can ’t make a wrong decision as long as you are the
one making it. This is a life—enhancing decision for the‘
woman. She is taking control of her own life. This may be
the ﬁrst time in her life that she is making her own decision. ”

——Jeanne Clark
Executive Director
Allegheny Women ’s Center

I do believe that I committed a sin, but
I’m too busy to think about that.”

“My only fear before the abortion
was that something would get screwed
up as a result of the operation, and
I'd never be able to have kids. I
thought, then, that it would serve me

' right if this happened.”

But ﬁrst-trimester abortions (12-14
weeks), which is the category that
54,000 out of 59,000 abortions per-
formed in Pennsylvania in 1983 fell in-
to, are not dangerous. The abortion
process is simple, and the actual
medical procedure takes between three
and ﬁve minutes. As Julie said, “It was
so quick and painless, it was as if I was
never even pregnant.”

For first-trimester abortions, the
most common method is vacuum aspira-
tion, which is performed at the
Allegheny Women’s Center under local
anesthesia or general anesthesia —
awake or asleep. In either case, a
positive pregnancy test is followed by
a counseling session, medical exarnina-

tions, an information session, the
operation, more examinations and a’
recovery period of about an hour. The
whole process takes about "fourhours.

“I guess you expect aborton to be
this horrible, painful thing,” said Julie.
“At least I did. But I had a general
anesthetic which knocked me out,’com-
pared to a local where you’re still con-
scious. I paid almost $80 more for the
general, but I hate pain.”

“There was no sign that any abor-
tion had taken place, I was taken to the
recovery room where I was too groggy
to do anything but sleep. After 45
minutes, a nurse woke me and said I
was well enough to leave,” continued
Julie. “She called my friends who were
picking me up, I went to the waiting
room, and I felt so weak, I had to lay
across the hard, plastic chairs.”

“As I was walking to the elevator ’
with my friends, I saw the
anesthesiologist. I wanted to thank him
for being so nice, but he didn’t
acknowledge my presence.” .

Volleyball
team heads
to Purdue

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

1 For the second consecutive NCAA
football season, the University of Pitts-
burgh has struggled through its
seasonal schedule. The Panthers
entered 1985 after suffering through
their worst season since 1972, when
Pitt finished with a 1-10 record. Thus

far, Pitt has ridden a roller coaster this 1

season, carrying a 4-4-1 record.

Under the direction of fourth-year
head coach Foge Fazio, Pitt’s record
has been an unimpressive 24-17-3.
Fazio’s coaching performance follows
a nine-year period in which Pitt was
83-22-2 under coaches Johnny Majors
and Jackie Sherrill.

Coincidentally, Pitt isn’t the only
team to suffer through bad times.
Boston College is finding their season

to be very difficult with a 3-7 mark, ‘
following the graduation of Doug '

Flutie. Only one year ago, the Golden
Eagles capped off a 9-2 season with a

win in "the Cotton Bowl over the-

University of Houston.

Another Eastern power, the West
Virginia Mountaineers, are also strug-
gling as they currently stand at 4-3-1.‘
This lethargic start follows four con-
secutive bowl appearances for WVU

- under Coach Don Nehlen, who has -

compiled a 35-13 record during that
period. A - ..

thers were winning easily in the first

them. The No. 16 Texas team squeaked

THE RESIDENT STUDENT ASSOCIATION '

The Sporting life

A By Bob Travers

A few thoughts in defense of F oge Fazio

It has become part of the fashion late-
ly for Pitt students to call for the ﬁr-
ing of football coach Foge Fazio and
to boo Fazio during games at Pitt
Stadium. Students aren’t the only ones
guilty of this. The Pittsburgh Press and
Post-Gazette have seen letters and
editorials calling for his resignation.
And the Almighty Alumni (read Golden
Panthers) are getting restless and quite
fed up with Fazio.

Fazio is in his fourth year as Pitt’s
head coach and has an all-time record
at Pitt of 24-17-3. His ﬁrst season as
head coach was Dan Marino’s senior
year. That team was supposed to be na-
tional champions and go undefeated.
They ﬁnished 8-3-1. Fazio was blam-
ed for that and the “experts” said he
was too lenient with the team and let
the seniors get away with too much.
The day before the team was supposed
to leave for the Cotton Bowl, freshman
Todd Becker was killed falling _out of

a third-story window. Pitt lost to Penn
State 48-14. Fazio’s ﬁrst year as head
coach was considered an unqualiﬁed
disaster by most Panther watchers.

In the past three years the team has
ranged from pretty darn good ( 1983)
to dismal (1984). Fazio has been under
the microscope all those years and any
mistakes have not gone unnoticed by
the media.

And now they want da bum ﬁred.
Not because he has lowered the moral
standards the university claims to
subscribe to by cheating at recruiting
as so many of his peers have done, and
not because he has acted like anything
less than the ﬁrst-class man he is at all
times, but because he has lost. Well,
oh my God!!!

Pitt isn’t winning as much as they
used to, so now let’s ﬁre the coach and
return to the good 01’ days of 11-1. The
university motto should be changed to

“WIN! WIN! WIN!” People seem
ready to go to any lengths to ac-
complish this. Even to the point of
sacriﬁcing the soul of the football team.
But as for me, I hope Foge Fazio
stays around as coach of the football
team for years and years. He is not and
has not been as successful as Johnny
Majors and Jackie Sherrill. That’s true
but I say it doesn’t matter. Foge Fazio
is a good man and that is all that counts.
We have to decide what college foot-
ball is played for. Just why does Pitt
bother to ﬁeld a football team every
year? If it is simply to win and make
money for the university, then the
players should be compensated hand-
somely; and I mean the stars of the
football team ought to be earning
thousands, maybe hundreds of
thousands of dollars in salary each
year. How much money do you think

Athleteiiof” the Week”

By Paul Fischer

Todd Smith

When the going gets tough, the
University of Pittsburgh soccer team
looks to Todd Smith to get it going.

Smith, a junior outside midﬁelder
from Mechanicsburg, Pa., scored the
only goal in Pitt’s recent 1-0 victory
over the St. John’s Redmen, and is The
Pitt News Athlete of the Week. The
victory was crucial in Pitt’s drive
toward their ﬁrst-ever Big East playoff
berth.

This season. Smith — known as
“Schmutz” to his family, friends and
teammates — is tied for second on the
team in goals and assists. But his real

value to the team only begins with-

5 statistics.

‘ ‘We’ve counted on Todd to provide
leadership this season," said Coach Joe
Luxbacher. ‘‘He’s a mentally tough in-
dividual and, as a result, has improved
his play every year he’s been here.”

Smith can be tough, even on his own
teammates if necessary. After all, this
is an athlete who considered choosing
the Naval Academy over Pitt.
“Leadership with me is a half and half

deal,” he said. “It’s got to be perfor-
mance, but I do a lot of talking on the
ﬁeld, too. Sometimes it gets negative,

but it’s constructive and designed to get

us playing better as a team.”

Smith’s team orientation runs right
in step with Luxbacher’s style of play,
which in two short years has trans-
formed a ﬂoundering program into a
Big East power.

“Things are 199 percent better here
than when I came in as a freshman,”
Smith Recalled. “The dedication has
changed from partying and carrying on
to caring about soccer.”

Smith is a young man who, behind
the scenes, probably helped reforge the
team’s attitudes and aspirations. Unlike
many students, he has vision beyond
his next meal or his next test.

“I’d like to make Pitt soccer team
a winning tradition, establish a prece-
dent for excellence by doing well,
maybe ﬁnishing second in the Big East
so that eventually the school puts more
money into the program, and maybe
ﬁve years down the road they have a
nationally-ranked program,” Smith
said. “And I can just feel good about
being part of the base for that priority.”

    team puts
freeze on
Duquesne

By Mary Wolf
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club upset
Crosstown rival Duquesne 7-5 Satur-
day, giving the Panthers their ﬁrstwin

Todd Smith

Apart from soccer, Smith has his
own basis of tradition and character he
has learned from and built upon. His

family is both athletically and artistical-

ly inclined. His father once played
baseball in the Brooklyn Dodgers’
system and boxed professionally in col-
lege under an assumed name to help
support his family. Smith’s sister, Deb-
bie, is a Temple graduate trying to
make it as a singer on Broadway.

A member of the Pi Kappa Alpha

of the regular season.

In the past Duquesne has proved to
be Pitt’s toughest opponent, and this
game stirred up much determination
and anxiety before the teams even took
to the ice. It was a very physical com-
petition with both teams throwing out
checks like it was the first of the month.

The game started out slowly with the
initial goal’ coming from Panther left
wing Tim Ross at 5:30 into the first
period. Duquesne retaliated with a goal_
later in the period, and the first section
of play ended with the score tied 1-1.

Fraternity, Smith has tried his own
pipes starring as a vocalist the past two
years for the Pika entry at Pitt’s Greek
Sing charity musical. “When I’m off
the ﬁeld, I like to have fun,” Smith
said.

Although his "plans are unclear after
graduating next year with a degree in
communications, Smith would like to
begin a coaching career after his play-
ing days are ﬁnished. Soccer would be
fortunate to maintain the association.

ard at time of

Goals from center Dave Zulick, Jim
Owens and Jeff Belle in the second
period gave Pitt a two—goal lead as the
teams returned to the locker room to
prepare for the final period.

When Pitt came out skating hard and
upped their lead by two more goals -
coming from Mark Bowers and Bill
Kicinski — within the first four minutes
of the third period, it looked as though
the Panthers were headed for an easy
victory over the Dukes. But things are
not always as easy as they seem, and
suddenly, midway through the third
period, the number 3 became a very
unlucky one for the Panthers.

“We started standing around for
about three minutes, and we just got
caught ﬂat-footed. I don’t know why, ’ ’
explained Zulick.

Those three minutes were detrimen-
tal to Pitt as Duquesne scored three
quick goals, narrowing the Panther
lead. By the end of it all, a trio of Pitt
skaters was crowding the penalty box,
leaving Pitt short-handed. But the Pan-
thers did a tremendous job of killing
the accumulated penalties, and Pitt’s
defense, while small in number, was
high in intensity to hold off the Dukes’
scoring attack for the remainder of the
game.

“We only rotate four defensemen on
our team,” said defenseman Gregg
Schmidtetter. ‘ ‘It’s kind of tough. You
get a little bit winded. But toward the
end of the third period, we were doing
pretty well.”

A final Pitt insurance goal again
came from Ross, a quick skater who
proved to be an important addition to
the Panther offense this year, along
with lineman Brian Owens. Both skated
a strong game for Pitt.

Defending the Panther net on Satur-
day was Jeff Rohay, who stopped 18
potential goals ﬁred at him by the
Dukes. “I don’t think Duquesne is as
good as the score indicated,” he said.
“I think we should have had at least
seven goals, but I don’t think they
should have had ﬁve. We didn’t play
the game we were capable of. The en-
tire game we had letdowns.”

Duquesne has always been Pitt’s ma-
jor rival, but now that the Panthers
have dethroned the Dukes, future
games with other strong opponents
have become the Panthers’ main
concern.

year, but I don’t think they were as
strong as they were last year," said
right wing Roger Oldaker. “We’ve got
a much better team this year. We’ve
got a lot of depth. We got Duquesne,
but now we want to get CMU and Gan-
non.”

The Panthers’ next game will be
against Slippery Rock on Sunday at
Meadville.

Tell the Refrigerator to chill out

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

The Chicago Bears are the toast of
this, the NFL’s 66th season, and
rightfully so. Sporting a 9-0 record and
a four—game lead in the Central Divi-
sion of the NFC, Chicago has their
championship-starved fans booking
January ﬂights to New Orleans, thesite
of Super Bowl XX. '

Amidst the efficient running of
Walter Payton, the cool personality and
durability of quarterback Jim
McMahon and the violently sup-
pressive defensive unit, a new type of
versatile appliance has plowed its way
to the pigskin-media forefront. This
latest technological dynamo, recently
developed in the football factory of
Clemson University, is called-Williarn
‘ ‘The Refrigerator’ ’ Perry.

Now, before all of you NFL head-
coaching conforrnists dash to the
nearest collegiate stadium in search of
your very own ‘ ‘Refrigerator’ ’ (not to
be confused with a Whirlpool), first
take a look at both the positive and

negative accessories that are included,
none of which are optional.

Starting with the pleasantries, the
“Refrigerator” is mass personiﬁed.
When used in short yardage situations,
he is an irresistible and punishing force.
Touchdowns from inside the ﬁve-yard
line come quite easily, as Perry bur-
rows through the twisted pile-up of
bodies while teaching individual
defenders a thing or two about the law
of inertia. As an offensive guard, the
“Refrigerator” is a juggernaut of an
escort. Linebackers .and comerbacks
attempting to foil a Chicago sweep are
easily ﬂattened by the 310-lb. lineman.

“What would you do if Perry was

coming at you?” said Utility Manager A

Mike Ditka. “You’d get the hell out
of the way!”

But wait a minute. Wasn’t Perry ac-
quired for his skills as a defensive
player? So much for the positives.

The disadvantages of having this
“Refrigerator” in the kitchen aren’t
likely to keep Buddy Ryan, Chicago’s
director of defensive operations, in a
jovial mood. First of all, renting one

will come with quite an exorbitant price ,

tag. (This newest model demanded,
and received, a multi-year, million-
dollar contract). Secondly, Perry is
slow — too slow to be an effective
defensive lineman in the NFL.
Through nine games this season, Perry
has averaged a staggering two tackles
and has semi-terrorized opposing
quarterbacks with a sack — yes,
singular.

Ryan had this evaluation of the foot-
ball world’s latest novelty earlier in the
year: ‘ ‘He’s just a big overweight kid.
He hasn’t shown me anything since
he’s been here. He's a wasted draft
choice and a waste of money.” So
much for satisﬁed customers.

Who knows what future days will
bring? Maybe Perry will “slim down”
to 280 pounds and run amuck. through
the offenses of the NFL,_ breaking
every individual defensive record
possible. Then again, some coaching
genuis may develop ‘ ‘The Freezer” —
a 400-lb. inside linebacker — and put
a cold stop to Perry’s offensive antics.
Or maybe the novelty will just wear
off, and William “The Refrigerator"
Perry will fade off into anonymity.

V The Pitt News, November 6,

 

“One of the hardest things
about college is learning how
to pay for it.”    

“May we help you?”

 
 
  

Dollar Bank knows that paying for an education can be an education in itself. That's why we 1
offer a number of low-cost loans designed with your borrowing requirements in mind. If you
think you ’ll need money for the winter term, nows the time to look into one of these

Dollar Bank loans.

Low 8% PHEAA Loans — This guaranteed student loan helps cover the cost of any
approved college, trade or vocational school, giving undergraduate student applicants up to
$2,500 per academic year and graduate student applicants up to $5, 000. Repayment doesn’t
begin until six months after leaving school, and you have up to ten years to repay. But your
family income affects eligibility. So other financing may be required.

Low 12 % PLUS Loans — Government-backed Parent Loans to Undergraduate
Students give parents, as well as independent undergraduates and graduate students, up to
$3, 000 a year as a supplement to or replacement for a PHEAA loan. There are no income
restrictions and you have up to five years to repay your PL US loan. 1 0

Low 1 1.2 5 %* Home Equity Loans — For maximum student loan help, your parents
can consider the loan that puts their home’s equity to work putting you through college. A
Dollar Bank Home Equity Loan. It has all the advantages of a variable rate and you don ’t
have to worry about maximum loan amounts. If your parents’ income is too high to qualify  
for other assistance, this is the loan to consider   e 5

PL US Loan andAHome Equity Loan applicants must meet
Dollar Bank’s credit criteria.
