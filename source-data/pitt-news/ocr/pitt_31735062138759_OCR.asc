We Are Waiting . . 

It is Spring.

We are waiting. This year it is not -for the ﬁrst robin, the
first lilacs, or the ﬁrst day when we can sit on the Cathedral
lawn. We are waiting for news—news of an invasion in Europe.

Some call it D—Day. Unfortunately, it will not be just
one day. There will be many days, many long days. We will
have to be patient and wait and wait and wait

What you want to do during this crisis is up to you. A lot
of Americans are going to buy more bonds and give blood
and volunteer .,for Red Cross duty. A lot of Americans are
going to pray.

Several churches are going to have special services, but
there will be no such service on campus. A lot of us, however,
will want to meditate during those days which lie ahead.
‘Heinz Chapel will be open as usual. That Chapel is the center
for worship on our campus. It is “our” sanctuary _,and the
appropriate place for our meditation.

It is Spring and we are waiting. Perhaps before another
Sprina omes round, some of our prayers will be answered and
we wil. be waiting for a homecoming. And robins and lilac
bushes will again be the things for which we are waiting.

And So Goodbye . . ..

, A long time ago an editor of the Pitt News wrote as his last
editorial a sad farewell column. There have been many editors
since that time—an_d many sad farewells. Just about every-
thing that can be said from the parting editor’s point of view
ha.s been said. I do not need to repeat. Anyone who knows me,
knows that I am sorry to leave the paper and the staff.

So I am not going to speak as an editor. Instead, I will
speak as a senior in the class of ’44.

We have been counting the days until graduation for over
a month now. We are working on our last term papers and
studying for our last exams. You have heard us brag about
that.

y We are ordering graduation announcements and caps and
gowns. We are paying graduation fees and asking profs if we
HAVE to come to class after senior grades are in. You have
heard us complain about all that.

What we are thinking most about, we have not discussed
so freely. But we are all thinking about it. Ifyou saw us at our
last class dinner, our last fraternity meeting, or our last

Physical Fitness
Week Observed

In accordance with “Physical
Fitness Week” from May 15 to 22,
a large meeting and demonstration
will be held at the Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial hall May 16.
Lieutenant Commander Harvey
Harmon, former football coach of
the University of Pennsylvania,
will be the principal speaker.

The purpose of “Physical Fitness
Week,” is to attain greater public
interest in the promotion of the
physical ﬁtness of our young men
and women. The Pennsylvania
State Association for health, phys-
ical education and recreation has
asked the cooperation of all organ-
izations interested in the well-being
of young people. Parents, educators
and organized groups in every sec-
tion of Pennsylvania are urged to
interest themselves in the events
which are scheduled to observe
“Physical Fitness Week” on a
state-wide basis.

TVA Offers Jobs
ToCollegeWomen

The Tennessee Valley Authority
has openings for women and non-
draftable men in professional, sub-
professional, administrative, skilled,
and semi-skilled work, it was
learned today. ‘

A bulletin received here suggests
that you should “utilize your college
training in a great regional agency
working for the nation’s welfare,
both in war and peace.”

Quoting further—-“TVA has a
big job to do——to produce billions of
kilowatt hours of electricity for the
national defense, to provide for
agricultural and industrial develop-
ment, to prevent ﬂoods and improve
navigation. To carry out this broad
program TVA must have scientists,
clerks, engineers, and administra-
tive oﬂicers, as well as laborers and
craftsmen.”

Further information may be se-

Spring Festival tea dance, you know that graduation fees and
caps and gowns are secondary matters. We are thinking about
four wonderful years at the University of Pittsburgh.

When we entered Pitt in,1940, there was no war. We like
to think back to those pre—war days because there was no
shadow to cut across the whirl of social events. We were a well
organized class, and most of us planned to stay together for
the whole four years. On December 8, 194] , we gathered around
portable radios in the Tuck Shops or .\’ar.; ofﬁce and listened to
President Roosevelt say the words which we knew had_to be
said and yet which surprised us because we could not fully
grasp their meaning. We were not sure just what would hap-
pen to Pitt. We know now. We have watched “our” boys march
away and other boys march in. We are proud of those boys
of ours, and we have enjoyed knowing boys who came to our
Army station. And we are Very proud of our school. The change
from school building to Army barracks is now history. People
outside the school will not soon forget it. For us, the change
went deeper than that. We watched all the old customs and
social traditions which were Pitt, change. They did not, how-
ever. (lisappear. That. is what we will remember.

We will remember. too, the fine people we have met here. 
Dean Amos. We were the last class fortunate enough to know 
her. Dean Rush, Dean Biddle, and Dr. Fitzgerald. They have
worked for us and with us in our activities and social events.
Faculty members like Mrs. Batz, .\Irs. Lohstoeter, and Doc
Carlson. We have all had our favorites. Students, some who
have graduated and some who will stay behind and who will,
we hope, remember us. Our own classmates.

Yes, we are looking backward.

But we are looking forward, too. We _know now how
quickly time can pass. We know that the University will ‘con-
tinue to grow and that other students will learn to love it as
we have. The Pitt of the future! We cannot help but wonder
what it will be like. We have great hopes for it. We know that
many share our hopes. As alumni, we will take a keen inter-
est in that Pitt. If it is not a.n even greater school than the
one we entered four years ago," then our four years have been
wasted. We have tried to pass on to you the best of pre—war
Pitt. Add to it the best of the present University, and the fu-
ture school will come up to our highest expectations.

. And so goodbye. We leave the University in your hands.
Remember that “Here is eternal Spring . . . for you, the very
stars of heaven are new.”

This morning, you know, at 11:30 is THE Tap Day to end all Tap
Days. All the BMOC’s and all the BWOC’s and some of the LMOC’s
and LWOC’s will be tapped to honorary organizations. Most import-.‘
ant of all is the announcement of Senior Queen and Alma Mater, .,
honoring two outstanding senior women. Popcorn and peanuts will. '
not be sold, but everyone’s going anyhow, just out of curiosity.

stuff like that. (We told someone’

that, and they said, "Oh, I see. Eat

Fio Rito seems to have succeeded.
He has more singers than the usual

tured on the band are Sam Sholnick,

Teddy Powell came to 7Pittsl>ur2“h‘

teen-year-old trombone player sang

Speciﬁcally:

until the emergency is ended, and
then the change must be made in
accord with narrowly prescribed
procedures.

The constitutional amendment
which established the ESGC stated
that “All provisions of the SFA con-
stitution . . . are hereby suspended‘
UNTIL THE END OF THE NA-
TIONAL EMERGENCY (capital

section 8A of that amendment stat-
ed that. “the present assembly shall

The student body has not peti-
tioned and voted, as provided in
section 7A, that the national emer-
gency is at an end. To do so would
outrage common sense. Therefore,
the establishment of a “permanent”
form of government i-s beyond the

within twenty-four hours after the

petition at two successive regular
imeetings-—on. April 25 and May 2.
The reply which follows is the re-
sult of that thinking. It is a state-
ment of ESGC’s vision for the new
organization as well as an answer
to speciﬁc challenges put to it by a
small group of students. The latter
would not be complete without the
former.

In proposing a new form of
student government at this time
ESGC had several things in mind.
It seemed both undemocratic and
unwise for six students to consti-
tute: our student government and
be a self-perpetuating group any
longer than absolutely necessary.
It seemed unwise that an appoint-
ed group of six students should
have the almost unlimited powers
delegated to it by SFA. No com-
mittee so constituted could long
hope to assume elfective leader-
ship of the student body. ESGC
was created in the early hysteria.
of the war when no one foresaw
that campus life could and must
go on throughout the crisis. Cer-
tainly, no generation of students
has the power, or would wish, to
bind future generations of stud-
ents to anything beyond the con-
trol of those students, or without
regard to changed cirinustances.
All SFA did, or could do, was to
act in the light of what knowledge
and judgment it had at the time.

With. that point of view ESGC
worked on a new set of by-laws to
propose to the student,body.\ They
wanted the framework to be sim-
ple, flexible and general enough to
give wide latitude for development
in a changing college world. They
wanted it to express a belief in the
common sense, the intelligence and
the good will of; students toward

The muscular fellow with the Texan drawl whom we see browsing
through the halls is Tex Hinte, the pride of Mt. Hope, West Virginia.
-Tex is one of the many discharged servicemen whohas come back to the

~ _University to continue his education; physical education is his major.

Behind Tex lie many memorable days in the realm of sports. Start-
ing his career in high school Tex played football for Mt. Hope and was
a ﬁve letter-man, starring in football, truck, baseball, boxing. and
basketball. In his senior year he captained the Mt. Hope eleven to the

section championship. alternating <v>

between fullback and end. His su-
’ perb play on the ﬁeld won him a
place on the all-state, all-county,
and Southern Conference teams.

tention to basketball; his team

It is not quite right to review Fwrlough, But Not Fw/‘long on the
strength of its Tuesday night dress rehearsal. However, there is no
choice in the matter because of publication deadlines. It should be made
clear for that reason that last night’s performance and tonight’s per-
formances obviously should be an improvement on what I saw Tuemlay.

you have attended it, you will learn nothing new from this column.
I would like to praise the excellent features of the production; the
members of the cast, the authors, the director, -and the stage hands have

they are likely to receive little
credit from a surprisingly apathet-
ic student body.

First, let the applause shower
upon Dr. Bernard Friedman for
the best performance of the eve-
ning. As the bul’foo'n, Egbert, his
acting was smooth, his comedy
impish, and his singing sincere.

The acting and singing burden of
the play rested upon the shoulders
of Gene Larson and George Leger.
Gene is good-looking and melodious;
George acted with deﬁnite earnest-
ness. l
Gloria Warren in her two brief
solo song scenes created a very
favorable impression. Her rendition
of four old favorites is guaranteed
to charm the most frigid critic.
The manpower shortage being
what it is, several members of the
cast were forced to play dual roles.
Bob Goldsmith is ﬁrst a student
and then Chancellor Bowman; he
also helped write the show. Jim Reg-
gio is ﬁrst a student, then a pro-
fessor, and ﬁnally a radio announc-
er; his most effective role is the
last. Bob Buell is a student, profes-
sor, and Army officer. Milt Tokash
participates in a Mr. Agony skit and
sings with the Glee Club. Herbert

several students. The boys are to
be congratulated for surprising ver-
satility. Miss Ruth Than,» the direc-
tor, probably deserves much of the
credit for their success.

Perry Jubileer and Gerry Mc-
Donough directed the chorus
and did several tap special-
ties. As for the chorus girls-—-I
can truthfully say that I have
seen worse at the Nixon. Betty
Rickman, Polly Foster, Pat Wil-
liams, and Betty Ann Crede per-
formed well as Pitt Co-eds. Abbie
Westerman took care of a serious
role. This scene was written by
the most famous of the radio
playrights, Norman Corwin.

Final acknowledgement goes to
Mr. Theodore Finney and his Glee
Club. The usual standards of the
Glee Club will more than suffice.

Ed Rose with the assistance of
Marcella Strutzel wrote much of the
play, acted in it, asisted with the

Pitt Still r/frying F

Replay Bucknell Sat.’-

During Festival
-Ralph Mitterling’s undauiyted and
winless Panthers will make their

'  fourth attempt to move into the blue
.y ink side of record book when they

take on Bucknell tomorrow at the
Stadium. This will be the second

1 time the Panthers have met the

Bisons from up-state. The ﬁrst

 affair was a total loss so far as the

 fered

Pitt men were concerned. The Buf-
faloes stampeded into a 10-6 VIC-

"tory when they lambasted Reber

"and Goldberg, and forced Mitter-

’ ling-to call upon a ﬁrst baseman to

conclude the seventh and eighth
innings. Lefty Johnny Lozar looked

' good when called upon in this emer-

gency and set the orange and blue-

' men down in one of the game's few

scoreless innings.

The game tomorrow will be of-
in conjujnction with the
Spring Festival and it is expected
the crowd may even exceed the

I ‘ overﬂow of 739 that ﬁlled the stad-

-. ium for the Juniata game when the
, Indians eked out an 8-7 win over

the skyscraper squad. Although
Coach Ralph Mitterling could not
be reached for his decision on his

K starting pitcher for tomorrow’s bat-

a tie but it is expected that he will

 use his veteran Jim Reber for the
' opening chores.

The rest of the lineup will con-

’ ‘sist of the same crew which started

the Bucknell and Army games. The
inﬁeld will have Lozar, Matthews,
Biehl, and Helvonic in that re-
spective order. Wettingale will do
the backstopping duties while Rep-
pert, Kielb, and Alman will guard
the outerpastures.

Woody ‘Ludwig will ﬁeld the same
combination that defeated the Pan-
thers last Saturday. His battery
will have Kelly throwing at Hubka.
Around the inﬁeld in order will be
Hewson, D. Reash, Day and Namin-
siak. At the outﬁeld gardens will
romp Lefkasdinos, B. Reash and
Burns.

Pitt Loses To Army

Theold adoge, “the third time is
‘the charm,” failed to hold for
Coach Mitterling and his undaunt-
ed diamond proteges as the future
“generals” from the United States
Military Academy at West Point
hammered Lefty John Lozar for
fourteen hits in the course of their
18 to 8 victory. It was the third
Panther loss in as many attempts
as the Army steamrolled to its ﬁfth
win in six starts, their lone defeat
benig credited to a 6-4 effort by
Dartmouth’s Navy trainees.

starter, and knocked him out of the
box in the seventh. Trailing by-a 16
to 2 count at this stage of the game
the Mitterling men decided to make
some sort of a showing and bunched
four of their eight hits for six runs.
However it was far from enough to
take any of the kick out of the Army
mule as the Cadets added two more
scores to their total before the after-
noon ended. Dave Zillmer and Les
Sprinkle held the Jungle Cats in
check for the ﬁnal two frames, al-
lowing but one hit between them.

Spotty ﬁelding by both clubs,
seven errors by the losers and six
miscues by the winners, marked the
slugfest.

Outhit By Bucknell

The Panther ball team, noted for
their winless ways on the diamond,
kept their t.wo—year losing streak
intact by absorbing a 10-6 batter-
ing by the ballhawks of Bucknell
on the Lewisburg ﬁeld. Bison Pitch-
er Jack Kelly, pitching against his
team mates of last year, pulled
himself out of many a tough situa-
tion after the locals put men on
base to account for the second Pitt
loss of the season.

Jim Reber, the only Navy trainee
on Pitt’s squad, won the starting
mound assignment after displaying
superb control in his relief stint
against Juniata. Big Jim just didn’t
have the stuff this time, however,
allowing Bucknell nine runs for the
six frames he worked. The Bisons
touched him for 11 hits, collected
seven walks and a hit batsman.
George Goldberg took up the pitch-

‘Tennis Team '

Meets Oberlin

Another of Pitts athletic teams,
this time the tennis squad, found
out “what’s good is in the Army.”
They too made’ this discovery the
hard way as the Cadet racket
wielders swung out a 9-0 verdict
over the inexperienced Panther
court representatives. It was the
initial match for Doc Hartwig’s
racketeers who tried hard to pre-
vent the West Pointers from taking
their seventh match o'f their all vic-
torious campaign.

The only trouble the Panthers

A » were able to cause came in the dou-

bles match when Pitt’s number one
and two men, Campbell and._Trim-
ble, combined to battle Cadets Grace
and Anderson before bowing in the
ﬁnal match.

Proving the versatility of the
Army were Doug Kenna and Dale
Hall, two of Army’s outstanding in-
tercollegiate stars. Kenna, football
brightspot and started on the mule’s
undefeated basketball ﬁve, added to
his laurels with two 6-1 wins over
Holmes. While Hall, all-American
court performer the past season, re-
corded two shut out matches against
Lauth. The summaries:

SINGLES
Daniels defeated Campbell. 6-]. 6-3.
Wood defeated Trimble, 6-1 6-0.
Kenna defeated Holmes, 6-1 6-].
Hall defeated Louth, 6-0, 6-0.
Steel defeated Levin. 6-1, 6-1.
Grace defeated Linelli, 6-0, 6-1.

Campbell, 8-6, 2-6. 7-5.

allowed one hit, one walk and one
run. Coach Mitterling in need of
another relief hurler called on
Johnny Lozar, the regular ﬁrst
baseman, to pitch the ﬁnal inning.
Johnny did very well for himself,
being the only hurler to get by with
no hits, walks, or runs in his turn
of the mound.

Second baseman “Red” Matthews

Three Way Deadlocé
In Softball League

The traditionally strong Phi
Gamma Delta softball team is lead-
ing the IF league thus far with
three wins against no losses, while
Pi Lambda Phi and Pi Kappa
Alpha are running close behind
with a 2-0 record. The Phi Gams
have already defeated Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Epsilon Pi, and the
Sigma Chi’s. They are out to win

All softball games scheduled
for Mondays and Fridays will be
played at Shady Side Academy
ﬁeld at 4:30.

their ﬁfth consecutive All-point
Trophy, but they won’t if the Pil-
ams or the PiKA’s have anything
to say about it.

In the ﬁrst PiKA game Pitchers
Bob Dompka held the Phi Eps to
10 runs while his own mates
knocked 17 counters across. It is
understood that Abby Steinkirch-
ner, now known as the Strike Out
King, contributed greatly to this
success. The second game was won
on forfeit from the Sigma Chi’s.

The Pilams defeated the Sigma
Chi’s, 16-4, in their ﬁrst contest and
a week later the Phi Eps were over-
run by them, 11-4. All three lead-
ing teams are ﬁghting to stay out
front.

Last week’s results included two
forfeits by Sigma Chi, which
has sh own little enthusiasm
for the competition. In t. e r e s t
in the games is mounting higher
and higher and the competition is
growing keener. The teams are
rounding into shape which means
thee games are getting better. At
the last few games small crowds
have even gathered to watch, and
the frats hope the students‘ will
come out to the contests and form
cheering sections. This afternoon at
1 :30 the Pilams and Phi Delts clash
at Trees Gym as part of the Holi-
day for Spring. A large crowd is
expected to attend this Festival
event.

A week ago Wednesday Sigma
Alpha Epsilon defeated Phi Delta
Theta 10-5, and the next day Sigma
Chi forfeited to PiKA. Friday Pi
Lambda Phi overran Phi Epsilon
Pi, 11-4, on the tricky pitching of
Nate Apple. On Monday Sigma Chi
forfeited again, this time to the
Phi Gams, and Tuesday SAE beat
the Phi Eps, 11-5.

Monday, May 8, it’s Phi Epsilon
Pi versus Phi Gamma Delta; Tues-
day the SAE’s battle the PiKA’s in
what should be a thriller. Wednes-
day the Delta Tau Delts meet the
Pilams and Thursday the Phi Eps
play the Sigina Chi’s. Phi Gamma
Delta and Pi Kappa Alpha wind up
the week’s competition one week
from today.
