Dukakis campaign returns to Pittsburgh

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Governor Michael Dukakis
continued his attacks on Vice
President George Bush yesterday,
while campaigning at David
Lawrence Convention Center in
Pittsburgh.

”Bush is reading the polls,”
Dukakis said. ”We’re taking our
case directly to the people. We're
the ones who are going to be
celebrating on the eighth of

November.”

Dukakis accused Bush of run-
ning ”c|ever” television adver-
tisements that misrepresented the
truth. He said the commercials
distorted his record so that voters
would forget about Bush's
record.

”The future of this country does
not depend on the kind of adver-
tising you get on Madison
Avenue,” Dukakis said. ’’It de-
pends on the kind of leadership
we get on Pennsylvania

Avenue.”

Dukakis said the ads mis-
represented his stand on gun con-
trol. He said that he supported
the right of hunters to own fire-
arms but is concerned about
criminals and the mentally ill ob-
taining them.

”This is a law enforcement is-
sue,” he said. ’’All they are ask-
ing for is a seven day waiting
period [to buy a gun].”

Dukakis also attacked the vice
president for supporting Ferdi-
nand Marcos and for considering
James Watt and Robert Bork ex-

cellent appointments.

He said that he would refuse to
help any country that did not
cooperate with the United States
in the war against drugs. He said
that Bush refused to take this
stand, even though Congress en-
couraged him to do so.

’’I draw the line at the lives of
our children,” Dukakis said. ”l

Dukakis supporters wave the flag as the presidential candidate addresses the issues at yesterday's rally downtown.

By William Young
Managing Editor

The second installment of
the Student Government
Board's ”Meet the Candi-
dates” night was held last
night in the William Pitt Un-
ion Ballroom.

Apathy was once again one
of the primary concerns ad-
dressed by the candidates for
board positions, whose pro-
posed solutions to the
problem included improved
communications.

Harper Watters said that the
reason for student apathy is
rooted in poor communication
between the SGB and the stu-
dent body, a sentiment
echoed by several other can-
didates.

Watters said that more SGB
talkshows on WPTS, as well as
SGB newsletters sent to the

Students meet the
candidates for SGB

students, would help alleviate
apathy by informing students
of what is going on.

”With the improvement of
these two means [of commu-
nication}, students will have a
more direct input into the
school itself. They will there-
fore be more aware of the is-
sues, which will allow them to
participate more fully in cam-
pus events,” Watters said.

Aside from Watters’ com-
ments to expand the SGB talk-
show and the newsletters,
most of the other candidates
pledged to listen to student in-
put. Several candidates
stressed that they would be
more than willing to meet with
students any time there were
a problem.

”We’d have set office hours,
and [during] any office hours
set aside for me I would be

Police face personnel problems  

By Michelle L. O'Brien
Staff Writer

Personnel problems were cited
as the biggest hindrance to effec-
tive police management in Pitts-
burgh by Pittsburgh Police Chief
Ralph Pampena in a lecture,
yesterday.

”The need for more manpow-
er is our biggest problem. The
public demands quite a bit [from
the police department], rightful-
ly so in most cases,” Pampena
said.

The lecture was sponsored by
Pitt's Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs.

Pampena said that the depart-
ment's manpower is drained by
special events in Pittsburgh and
the city's ever-increasing need for
specialized units, such as the
Hazmat and River Rescue teams.

”Forty to 50 officers are re-
quired for an event like the Three
Rivers Regatta,” he continued.

Pampena said the department
is considering a policy requiring
special-interest groups which

sponsor events such as parades
and rallies to pay the department
up to half of the cost of security
for the event.

Officers’ overtime pay also
strains the department's budget,
according to Pampena. Under the

Student
nearly
drowns in
Trees pool

By Marc Duchin
Editor In Chief

A female Pitt student re-
mains in critical condition at
Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal after she was found uncons-
cious in a swimming pool at
Trees Hall on Saturday.

According to Walt Waters,
assistant director for campus
police, the student was found
floating near the bottom of the
Trees Hall small pool at ap-
proximately 3 p.m. by an
unidentified swimmer. She
was immediatly given mouth-
to-mouth resuscitation before
campus police and paramed-
ics arrived on the scene. She
was later taken to the
Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal Trauma Unit.

Waters refused to release
the name of the student.

”[Paramedics] managed to
get vital signs, but she never
regained consciousness,” said
Waters. ”There were no
bruises [on the girl]. It didn't
look like she hit her head.

”At this time, we don't
know if she had a heart attack
or something that would cause
her to be down in the water.”

court appearances required of
officers when they make an ar-
rest. The arresting officer is paid
for three hours of overtime,
regardless of the length of court
proceedings‘.

The agreement also requires
the department to undergo bind-
ing arbitration to resolve any is-
sues not agreed upon in collec-
tive bargaining sessions. These ar-
bitrators are appointed by the
state.

Pampena said he resents the
’’loss of management rights” to
independent arbitrators. He said
this gives power over local issues
to people who are in no way con-
nected with the city.

Pampena cited several possible
solutions to personnel problems.
He said current hiring practices
are ”poor” and need to be over-
hauled.

”We [in the department] have
agreed to take a good, hard look
at the lack of educational require-
ments and other requirements,”
he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) .~ The
Supreme Court, confronting drug

‘testing in the American work-

place for the first time, was urged
by Attorney General Dick Thorn-
burgh and his top courtroom law-
yer on Wednesday to uphold
mandatory tests for many railroad
and Customs Service employees.

The importance attached to the
pair of cases by the administra-
tion was underscored by Thorn-
burgh’s participation, marking
the first time that an attorney
general appeared before the high
court since President Reagan took
office. He was joined by Solici-
tor General Charles Fried.

”This is a case about railway
safety,” said Thornburgh, who
presented the administration's
position in a dispute over manda-
tory blood and urine tests for rail-
road workers after accidents or
rules violations.

He said the case was about
”the hazards created by use of

drugs and alcohol by those in
charge of trains.”

Press barred from

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A $250

”It’s a private function for a
member who doesn't want any

cierge at the Union League. ”My

Hopkins said the Union League

Blair County woman
charged in fraud

HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pa. (AP) —
Authorities say they filed fraud
charges against a Blair County
woman and two Cambria County
residents who allegedly helped
her steal more than $500,000
from State Farm Insurance Co.

Christina M. Castellucci, 30, of
Altoona, Dulcie Altimore, 52,

Castellucci, a clerical worker at
the State Farm claims office in Al-

lent claims and sharing payments
with people who cashed the
checks in Cambria, Blair and
Clearfield counties.

Attorney General LeRoy S.
Zimmerman said Altimore and
Piurkowsky aided Castellucci in
the scheme. Investigators are pur-
suing suspicions that others were
involved in cashing insurance
checks.

’’In each instance those in-
volved were told they were to

of the money generated by her
illegal activities while retaining a

’’If you think you can do to
Michael Dukakis what Noriega
did to George Bush, you’re going
to be in for a very big surprise on
Jan. 20, 1989.”

He also attacked the Republi-
cans for ignoring the needs of the
people. He noted that Bush cast
the tie—breaking vote in the Senate
in 1985 to cut a cost of living in-
crease for Social Security.

”They want to help the people
who already have it made, the
people on easy street,” Dukakis
said. ”lfyou believe in good jobs
and full employment, we're on
your side.”

Dukakis said that the Republi-
can claim that Harry S. Truman
would support Bush if he were
alive today is false.

”They don't have any heroes of
their own, so they have to take
ours,” Dukakis said, noting that
Truman felt that working families
were entitled to basic health in-
surance.

”Times are different, but the
fundamental issue is the same,”
he said. ”Wil| we have a presi-
dent who stands up for opportu-

nity for every citizen of this
country?”

Dukakis promised to turn the
trade deficit into a trade surplus,
and voiced support for legislation
forcing plant owners to give
workers 60 days notice before

I have to relax, and that takes up
the time.”

Abeshouse, who has hepatitis
and liver sclerosis, spends much
of his time satisfying his body's
demands. Besides taking medica-
tion throughout the day, he must
also sleep when his body requires
it. Some days he will wake up at
10 a.m., and other days he may
wake up at noon. Because of his
liver problems, he doesn't get any
sleep every third or fourth night.

house to rest and develop his

his home in Woodbridge, Conn.,
after he was diagnosed as having
hepatitis and sclerosis of the liver.

"There just isn't a place which
could be a home away from
home, but Family House is as
close as it gets,” says Abeshouse,
who has lived at Family House
for two months.

"This is the longest I've been ,

away from my life at home. It is
a dramatic change to be living in
a place where I never would have
dreamed of being at the age of
65." ‘

Abeshouse has found a certain
comradeship with the other resi-
dents at Family House.

"Some of the talk is small talk,
and some of it is serious. When
a person has a bad day, it usual-
ly isn't,him who is talking. It is his

Freedom Center treats addicts

‘By Ugochi Oyoyo

Staff Writer

Each. day approximately 745
people visit the St. Francis Hospi-
tal outpatient clinic to be treated
for chemical dependency, ac-
cording to Bonnie Kin, M.P.N.

These patients are newborn in-

,fants, adolescents, college stu-
dents, working adults and the

elderly of Western Pennsylvania
who are chemically dependent.
The Freedom Center is St. Fran-
cis’ newest approach to treating
addictive diseases. In 1985, it be-
gan as ”free, fourth Friday [of the
month] forums,” said King, in-
terim coordinator of profession-
al education for the center.
”We were testing the waters to
see if this kind of format would
interest people who wanted to
learn more about chemical de-
pendency,” said King.
Workshop attendance since
then has increased from "20 or
25 people to about lO0,” said
Tod Marion, a member of the
center’s advisory board. .
”This says that people want to
be educated,” said King, which
”is important since four out of 10
of us will be either livinglwith or
married to someone with an ad-
diction, while one out of 10 may
become an addict.”
The center offers a wide spec-
trum of educational workshops

and seminars addressing topics in
chemical dependency, including
common issues linked with ad-
dictive behavior.

Some of these are described as
”women at risk for developing
addictions, rape and incest, 
breaking down the walls of deni-
al, infants born addicted and
elderly individuals with depen-
dencies.” _

For the first time, the Student
Assistance Program was conduct-
ed at a univeristy —- Duquesne.
Every high school in the area has
been through the program, said
King. p

Under the program, teachers,

principals and professors are
P given ”an intensive week-and-a-

half-long training program on
how to recognize symptoms of
dependency, how to approach
[the student] and then the parents,
and  how to handle [the stu-
dent] when he comes back to
school after having been away for
treatment,” said King.

”The college students interest-
ed in helping out were welcome
to attend so they could help their
roommates, classmates or
friends,” said King. ”Pitt hasn't
approached us yet on coming
there, but hopefully they soon
will.”

’’In the last two years there has
been [an increase] of chemical
dependency programs, mostly

due to Nancy Reagan's promo-
tion,” said Marion.

A ”These have been erratic and
basically covered what some-
body felt like talking about, like
a hot topic, and not what institu-
tions and supervisors needed
their counselors to learn,” Mari-
on said.

”The center allows us to pin-
point the exact kind of training
[that] counseling staff need,” he
said.

One way this is done is through
Lawrence R. Sutton's research. As
director of research for the center,
”his research on national and in-

IFC endorses Baldauf
for Board president

By Jason Hillman
Contributing Editor

The lnterfraternity Council
endorsed Kent Baldauf for
SGB president and four candi-
dates for the Student Govern-
ment Board at a meeting on
Tuesday night.

The four candidates are
Robyn Dion, Julie Shepard,
Erik Sossman and C. Harper
Watters.

Shepard addressed the
council, praising the IFC and
Panhellenic Association for
the Our Choice program and
other campus involvement
and outlining some of the pro-
grams she would like to do as
an SGB board member that
would concern the Greeks.

In other business, Ron Bizik,
this year's Greek Week over-
all chairman, urged Greeks to
donate blood during the Pitt-

Penn State Challenge, stating
that the 2,200 pints the Greeks
donated last year saved 1,600
lives in the city of Pittsburgh.

Greek adviser Brigette
Guernsey spoke about
reduced violence at Greek
parties, praising the Greeks for
lowering the number of inci-
dents and calls to the police.
But she urged the members of
the IFC to call the police if
somebody from outside the
fraternity causes trouble at one
of their parties.

Guernsey cited a few inci-
dents where some bones were
broken and told the IFC that
such incidents can only cause
harm to the Greek system.

The IFC also agreed to a
rematch with The Pitt News in
a football game sometime in
the future. The two organiza-
tions played softball over the
summer.

SKIP —- Neither do I.

CUBBY — We can see Rambo

CUBBY — Well, that's about it.

Embattled

Sen. Dan Quayle described in-
tense criticism of his credentials

S to be vice president of the Unit-

ed States as ”hatefu'l and nasty”
and, in an hour—long interview,
laid the blame for his public im-
age problem at the feet of Gov.
Michael Dukakis' campaign.
Quayle and his wife, Marilyn,
spoke with me at their suburban

 Washington home.

Quayle said it was the publish-
ing of ”rumors and innuendo”
about his National Guard Service
during the Vietnam era which got
him off to a bad start. ”After [the
press] did their research,” he
said, ”which was after they had
reported [the rumo_rs], they found
out there was nothing there.”

Asked if he was hurt by such
stories, Quayle responded, "I’m
a very proud man. I'm proud of
my accomplishments, and when
these things are said, obviously

...there's a certain hurt to it." Most

people's reactions, he said, are

Responding to a scathing
Chicago Tribune editorial which

THOMAS

endorsed George Bush for presi-
dent, but which called his run-
ning mate ”lousy" because ”his
qualifications for governing the
country are at best suspect,”
Quayle said he is ”perfectly con-
fident that I'm qualified to be vice
president or, if a tragedy would
take place, to be president.”
Would Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev be more likely to test
a President Quayle after reading
what has been said about him?
”I think [the Soviets] will test
any new administration," he said.
”They tested the Kennedy ad-

ministration. They've tested the

Quayle indicated that he
would fill a role as vice president
identical to the one played by
George Bush. ”It's a position
where you are a loyal supporter
and implementer of the presi-
dent's policies.” If any disagree-
ment should arise, Quayle would
express his views to Bush in pri-
vate. He said he would not hesi-
tate to express his opinions to
Bush if he disagreed with him.

Some conservatives are wor-
ried that, if elected, Bush might
drift toward the more moderate to
liberal wing —— Rockefeller
Republicanism — that character-
ized much of his political life be-
fore Ronald Reagan, but Quayle
doesn't think so.

"George Bush is a conservative
man," he told me. ”His basic po-

CUBBY -— Well, that's about it.

SKIP — So, what do you want

CUBBY —— I don't know, what

do you want to do?

SKIP — I don't care.

CUBBY — Neither do I.

SKIP —- Suddenly, studying for

exam looks awfully exciting.

CUBBY — More exciting than

SKIP — You think?

CUBBY — Definitely!

tecting individual liberties — is
basically conservative.

While he has had little time for
substantive discussions with Bush
about objectives of a Bush-
Quayle administration, he's not
worried: "We'll have two months
between the election and the in-
auguration.”

Both Quayles are committed
Christians who attend a McLean,
Va., Presbyterian church and
who are considering whether, if
elected, they should continue go-
ing to church or, because of the
potential for disruption, hold
services and Bible studies at the
vice president's residence.

Quayle already sees something
of the hand of God in his selec-
tion as George Bush's running
mate. ”The Lord moves in mys-
terious ways," he said.

SHOWCASE  

November 3, 1988

By Dmitri Ragano

Staff Writer

The new U2 concert film, Rat-
tle and Hum, delivers everything
we've come to expect from pop’s
post—punk prophets: energetic
music, soulful performances and

T plenty of heavy—duty indignation

concerning world affairs.

The band is captured in a
decidedly gritty black and white
setting (as if to symbolize their
mind set). It's interesting how the
camera zigzags around the stage
and leaps right up onto the faces
of the band members. The con-
cert scenes are generally captivat-
ing, although the songs all sound
pretty much the same.

On-stage performances are
done by lead singer Bono, who
alternates writhing Christ-like
poses with a little old—fashioned
rump shaking. ‘ “

The movie takes us through
U2’s process of ”Americaniza—
tion” which began with their
watershed album, The Joshua
Tree, and the U.S. tour that fol-
lowed. The band wanders
through Harlem and the Sun stu-
dios in Memphis. There's also a
subtly poignant trip to Graceland.

This is the story of U2 ”grow-
ing” as well as traveling. As one
member says with apt tongue—in—
cheek: ’’It’s a musical journey.”
There's plenty of emphasis on
musical progression, but I'm still

not sure what has progressed.
Does a couple of bars of harp at
the end of the song ”Desire” con-
stitute some kind of revolution?
The band teams up with a
Harlem women's choir for an ex-
uberant ”| Still Haven't Found
What I'm Looking For” that easi-
ly outdoes the original.

The best part is when Bono
bows out and lets the ladies take
over completely.

As for this new blues infatua-
tion, well, let's just say Bono’s no
B.B. King. Luckily, King is on
hand, and after his knockout
cameo, maybe some U2 devo-
tees will hit the oldies bin in
search of real blues. The old U2

is still the best U2. When Bono’s
valley-boy brogue reaches a wail
and Edge's guitar apocalypse
kicks into full throttle, you'll be
begging for more.

Rattle and Hum doesn't neces-
sarily reflect the essence of the
band, but it does capture the es-
sence of their popularity. U2 has
come to represent a cozy, harm-
less reminder of social con-
science for the apathetic. We can
side with Bono when he lashes
outat South Africa and still sup-
port an administration that re-
mains buddy—buddy with P.W.
Botha and friends.

They give us the image or re-
bellion but none of the threat.
And in 1988 America, that’s just
what the customers ordered.

Rattle and Hum has the mak-
ings of a quality film, but some-
thing about it feels unfulfilling.
Maybe it's the uneventful inter-
views or the occasional lapses in
momentum. Whatever it is, Rat-
tle and Hum doesn’t have that fi-
nal piece of the puzzle that
makes a rock film satisfying. It
will be a must-see for U2 fans,
but I'm not so sure about the rest
of us.

U2

The Record

U2
Rattle and Hum
Island Records

”Elvis Presley and America,” ”Pride
(In the Name of Love),” ”Bullet the Blue
Sky,” ”Stranger in a Strange Land” -—- the
lyrics of the lrish quartet U2 have long
held a deep fascination with the physi-
cal and human landscape of America.
But never before have U2’s lyrics and
music been as obviously rooted in
America than on their latest record, the
double album set, Rattle and Hum.

The album is the soundtrack to a film
of the same name (set to be released
Nov. 4) which details U2’s1987 Ameri-
can tour. Rattle and Hum covers some
old ground with a few rather faithful live
takes of some of the band’s bigger songs
and two live cover tunes, but it is in the
LP’s nine new original songs that this al-
bum finds its clear focus.

Three songs done at Sun Studios in
Memphis, the site of Elvis Presley's first
recordings, show most vividly the band's
thoughtful use of American music forms.

”Angel of Harlem” sounds like vintage

electric-era Bob Dylan, jolted by blasts
of Stax horns. ”Love Rescue Me” is simi-
lar to an early Hank Williams piece and
”When Love Comes to Town” (on
which B.B. King guests) hosts good, solid
urban blues.

More obviously than ever before, U2
pays homage to gospel music too. The
genre seems perfect for a band so rever-
ent and spiritually oriented.

Not surprisingly, a live version of
Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking
For,” on which Bono is joined vocally
by the New Voices of Freedom Choir,
is emotionally charged, with a sense of
warmth, dynamism and spontaneity.

The new song ”Hawkmoon 269"
burns with a similar gospel fire at its con-
clusio.n as well.

While Bono, the band's principal lyri-
cist, has often gotten away with vague-
ness and near—cliches in his writing
because of the band's vocal and musi-
cal power, many of Rattle and I/um’s
new songs benefit from a new-found fo-
cus on their experiences in the United
States.

Ill

”Heartland,” easily the album’s most
enrapturing track, draws an intriguing
portrait of the power of the land to heal
and to hurt.

Cuts like ”Hawkmoon 269" and ”All
I Want Is You” on the surface sound like
love songs, but have undercurrents of
longing for an ideal to be found in our
nation.

”Desire” continues the theme, explor-
ing the drug—like power of American
excess.

Also interesting is ”Van Diemen’s
Land,” a song composed and sung en-
tirely by the band’s guitarist, the Edge,
which draws liberally from the work of
Woody Guthrie in its spare arrangement
and concern for land, bread and people.

Were it not for some less inspired mo-
ments, Rattle and Hum might be the
sharpest, richest record yet released by
U2. A slow, churning cover of ”Helter
Skelter” and a rather straightforward
reading of ’’All Along the Watchtower”
are two songs that never really ignite for
the band.

”Pride,” as the obligatory sing—along,

llllTlli§l|llM

is also of moderate interest at best.

Another problem is the length of some
of the songs. Tracks that could have end-
ed in four or five minutes just end up
repeating themselves longer than
necessary.

But even with its weaknesses, the
faults likely rooted in the album being
a soundtrack to a film rather than ”the
new U2 record,” Rattle and Hum has
such a sense of purpose, confidence and
experimentalism within the American
idiom, it still ranks with the band's finest
work. U2 has undoubtedly hit their ar-
tistic stride.

In their tribute to John Lennon, ”God,
Part II,’’ Bono spits out: ’’I don't believe
in Goldman, his type like a curse/ Ins-
tant karma’s gonna get him if I don't get
him first/ I don't believe that rock and roll
can really change the world/ as it spins
in revolution, spirals and turns 

He says a lot about what depth the
combination of U2’s fiery passion and
ever-increasing maturity will hopefully
continue to bring to their work.

R&B performers are Sure! to swing the Civic Arena

Brown/Al B. Sure! tour is un-
doubtedly a heartstopper. These
men have what it takes to make
Pittsburgh the hottest town

By Danita Anderson
For The Pitt News

The Al B. Sure! Tour will hit
Pittsburgh on Nov. 9 at the Civic
Arena, as a very special guest for
none other than the smash artists
New Edition with the incredible
Bobby Brown.

Mr. Sure! is touring the coun-
try, and although he isn't being
promoted as the main performer,
he brings with him a sizzling per-
formance. Al B. Sure! is being la-
beled by many as the tall, tan,
teasing, tempting, young (he's
only 19, girls!) seducer of the
rhythm and blues industry.

"From his smooth, hypnotizing
notes on ”Nite and Day” to his
finger-snapping, head—popping
beats on ”Off On Your Own
Girl,” Al B. Sure! has rocketted to
the top of the charts with his
debut album In Effect Mode.

Al B. Sure! has already estab-
lished himself as a superb artist
and producer. Al B. sang in the
video production of Sesame Park
Place at the age of 15. Recently,
he won the Sony Innovator
Award for his amazing talent,
beating 50 extremely gifted con-
testants. ‘

For Al B. Surel, however, it
didn't always look as if he would

turn out to be one of the hottest,
sexiest men in the music indus-
try. Growing up in Mas-
sachusetts, he excelled in both
baseball and football in high
school and earned three letters.
As a result of his superb athletic
abilities, Al B. Sure! was offered
a sports scholarship by the
University of Iowa.
Although Al B. did not pursue
. a career in sports, he has domi-
nated the R&B and pop charts,
demonstrating his abilities "as
both an exhilarating singer and a
talented producer.
On his current album, In Effect
Mode, Al B. Sure! _wrote all of the

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 3, I988

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

Not many actresses in Holly-
wood have had the cherished op-
portunity that Barbara Hershey
hashad in pursuing diverse roles,
especially ones which continual-
ly challenge flexibility and inven-
tiveness. Over the last few years,

OHershey has demonstrated a

remarkable prowess at playing a
wide variety of characters, earn-
ing her recognition that has made
her one of the most sought—after
names in Hollywood.

Her dynamic reputation is, to
be sure, evidenced in her most
recent films, which include such
notable works as The Natural,
The Right Stuff, Hannah and Her

3 Sisters, Hoosiers and Andrei Kon-

chalovsky’s Shy People, for
which she won the Best Actress
award at the 1987 Cannes Film
Festival.

And ofcourse, who could for- I
get her riveting performance as
the tatooed Mary Magdelene in
Martin Scorcese’s The Last Temp-
tation of Christ, a role which en-
hanced her versatility as a serious
actress and further established
her foothold as one of America's
leading acting talents.

In A World Apart, Hershey
once again illustrates just how
talented she is by creating a
character completely different
than the ones she has played
before.

Set against the turbulent back-
ground of 1963 South Africa, A
World Apart focuses on the rela-
tionship between a mother, one

who is dedicated to the war ;

against apartheid, and a daughter
who must struggle against polit-
ics in order to love and under-

- stand her mother.

Barbara Hershey is Diana Roth,
a wife, mother and journalist,
who, along with her husband
Gus (Jeroen Krabbe), supports the
anti-apartheid cause in South
Africa.

When her husband is unex-
pectedly sent into hiding, Diana
is torn between her full—time
duties as courageous freedom
fighter and her responsibilities as
a mother. Diana’s 13-year-old
daughter Molly (Jodhi May) be-
gins to feel the repercussions of
her mother’s involvements and
becomes neglected and
confused.

Later, after Diana is arrested un-
der the newly formed 90-day De-
tention Act, Molly is isolated in
loneliness, and her friends are
pressured into disassociating

the '60s were the basis of her sto-

Barbara Hershey delivers her finest performance

as a model for Slovo’s Diana
Roth.

Her script is a touching, per-
sonal vision of her own child-
hood in Johannesburg, and it
effectively illustrates the traumat-
ic and horrible effects of apart-
heid on an innocent family.

One of the most fascinating
aspects of the film is that it is seen
almost entirely through the eyes
of Molly, the 13-year-old girl who
must cope with her mother's im-
prisonment.

The CoodEarth: Bright young hopefuls resound

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

I spent the weekend getting
back to basics and getting in tune
with nature. I tapped into emo-
tions that dealt with sincerity,
abandonment, beauty and faith.

I . I experienced The Good Earth.

Brian Dunn, lead singer of one
of the city's newest bands, The
Good Earth, is loquacious, yet
soft spoken. His gentle demeanor
clashes with his black leather
jacket as he discusses his music.
His boyish charm and en-
thusiasm are slightly bridled as he
carefully outlines his thoughts.

”Being in a band is a tool for

something larger,” he said.
know it's idealistic to say that.
Everybody says that whether
they’re doing so or not, but I
hope we are.”

Dunn's honesty, openness and
youth encapsulate the entire
band. Dunn, guitarist Allen
McCune, bassist Scott Riebling
and drummer Chris Sloan each
possess a certain amount of
eagerness and naivete that, when
coupled with their musical abili-
ties, lead to some strikingly in-
sightful songwriting.

Dunn is credited for the lyrics,
and he said that he draws upon
personal experiences and
feelings. I

”I can write about experiences
whether I've lived for 80 years or
17. I think our youth gives us our
integrity. We're not jaded," he
said.

McCune added that Dunn's lyr-
ics represent the band as a whole.

”He writes about things that we
all can relate to. He's expressing
many of our  thoughts as well
as his own,” he said.

Like most other bands, the
melodies rare fashioned de-
mocratically.

”Al comes up with a basic
melody, but we all add our input
and suggestions. Scott usually
does the editing. Then we come

to a conclusion [about] whether

we like it or not,” Sloan said.
The Good Earth began taking
root last July when Dunn and
McCune were introduced by a
mutual friend. Their similarities,
especially in musical tastes, lead
to a solid friendship and founda-
tion for the band. Add the strong,
rhythmic forces of Riebling and
Sloan, and the group was set.
Folk and new music, a not-so-
odd combination nowadays,
have influenced this band.
”We intended on playing mu-
sic that stressed our folk roots,
blended with a new wave
sound,” McCune stated.
”But what we're doing now is
a little different,” Riebling added.

”There’s a commercial edge, not 

unlike U2; there's folk and there's
something -I can't really
categorize.”

McCune cringes at the mention
of U2.

”We’re not a U2—c|one band,”
he emphatically stated.

Dunn, whose deep singing
voice is comparable to Bono’s,
explained, ”There’s no denying
that I'm an Irish baritone. There
is a U2 sound to some, maybe
two or three, of our songs. I don't
think we should try to escape that
because that's as much us as any-
thing else.”

Fast-starting Scarlet Knights wary of Panthers

By Vince Carey
‘ Sports Editor
The Rutgers Scarlet Knights
(AKA New Jersey's team) used to
be a team on a roll. They came

out of the gate to defeat Michigan
State (back when the Spartans
were expected to be contending
forthe Big 10 crown) 17-13 in the
first game of the season. Two
weeks

later thev went into

Beaver Stadium as underdogs
and beat Penn State 21-16. The
following week, the Knights
soundly beat Cincinnati 35-8 and
were touted as the next ‘Beasts of
the East.’

Mike Botti leads the Rutgers ground game with 533 yards rushing and four touchdowns.

Then it started to fall apart.
They lost to Syracuse 34-20,
Army 34-24 and Temple 35-30.
Only a_win against Boston Col-
lege after the Syracuse game
(17-6) mixed things up.

”Certainly at this stage of the
season things aren’t going well
for us,” Rutgers coach Dick An-
derson said. ”We had some big
wins and got a lot of attention for
them. We played really good in
a few games, but the last two
have been nothing. We haven't
played well at‘all.

”We have given up the big
play on defense. Offensively,
we've played fairly well, but we
haven't played near as consistent
as earlier. We are hoping to get
our team back on track and play-
ing better football.” '

This week, Rutgers (4-4) makes
a stop at Pitt Stadium to take on
the Panthers (4-3). Anderson is
ready for a tough game.

“We certainly have our ‘work
cut out for us this week,” Ander-
son said. ”They are a talented
football team and have a lot of
good athletes. it will be a
challenge and a half.”

It is the Panther offense that has
Anderson concerned, and right-
fully so. Pitt has scored at least 31
points in five games this season,
the exception being a 30-20 loss
to Notre Dame and a 31-10 set-

back to West Virginia. They have
gained 3,148 yards in total
offense so far this season.
Spearheading the offensive-
minded Panthers are quarterback
Darnell Dickerson (1138 yards
through the air) and running back
Curvin Richards (730 yards

rushing).

”They are a very balanced foot-
ball team,” Anderson said. ”That
worries me. They are able to do
things via the run or the pass.
Dickerson is a very fine athlete
and he can, occasionally, turn a
bad play into a good one.”

The Rutgers offense isn't that"

bad either. They have put a lot of
points on the board this season.
Through eight games they have
ammassed 197 points to their op-
ponents 181. The Knights have
also 3043 total offensive yards.

Rutgers is led by senior quarter-
back Scott Erney (1808 yards
through the air). Anderson runs
the run-and—shoot offense and
could be dangerous to Pitt's in-
jured and young defense.

’/They have played ve.ry well
early in the year,” Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried said. ”Erney is a
good "athlete. They throw the ball
a lot. They combine the drop-
back with the run-and-shoot.
They have fine ret ievers and can
do a lot of things.”

Pitt linebacker Ricardo
McDonald doesn't sound that
worried.

’’I think we can catch them
when they try to open it up,”
McDonald said. ”The run—and-
shoot can open you up to the
defense.”

The Panthers are a team filled
with injuries. Offensive linemen
Tom Ricketts (ankle) and Roman
Matusz (broken rib) are down.
Running back Adam Walker has
practiced this week and is possi-
ble for the game. Defensive tack-
le Marc Spindler is expected to
miss the rest of the season be-
cause of knee surgery. Fellow
tackle Richard Allen is also out
with a knee injury. Free saftey
Troy Washington is doubtful.

This could severly hurt the Pitt

chances
”We are hurt badlv at the

defensive line,” Gottfried said.
”That is pretty much where we
stand at the moment.”

There is another moment for a
few Pitt players. The state of New
Jersey is the second largest con-
tributor to the Pitt team (Pennsyl-
vania being first) with 15 players
hailing from the Garden State.

”As we get ready for Rutgers it
reminds me of the New Jersey
situatuion,” Gottfried said. ”This
could be a very important game
for us recruiting wise.” '

Panther wide reciever Henry
Tuten hails from Camden, New
Jersey and says this game will feel
a little different.

’’It will feel sort of like a high
school All-Star game, because I
know so many players on their
team,” Tuten said. ’’I know a few
guys on the team. After the game,
we can talk and I can kid them

on how we defeated them, hope-
fully. It is nothing like playing
against your best freinds.

’’Plus, they didn't recruit me as
a football player. They wanted
me to play basketball. I want to
show them that I am capable of
playing Division one football.”

Freshman McDonald is also
from New Jersey (Paterson) and
feels pretty much the same as
Tuten. ‘

”We are going to be playing
my home team,” McDonald said. V
’’It will give me great pleasure to
play against them. That way I can
show them what I'm all about.”

Other starters from New jersey
are Osborn, Matusz, cornerback
Robert Bradley.

So, this game will mean more
to a few Panthers, which should
make everything more in-
teresting.

Men's swim team wants another title

By Scott Campbell
For The Pitt News

The University of Pitts-
burgh's men's swimming team
opened its season last Saturday
with a 138-54 demolition of
Duquesne University.

Officially, that score includ-
ed only freshmen swimming
performances. The upperclass—
men swam, but were not
counted in the final results.

However, Duquesne is not
in the same class as the Pan-
thers, who have won the Big
east championships every year
since joining the conference
and finished in fourth place
out of 40 teams in the Eastern
Seaboard championships last
year.‘

This Friday, Pitt will get a

better test of their talent, ac-
cording to men's swimming
coach Dick Bradshaw, when
they host St. Bonaventure at
Trees Pool.

”This will be one of our
three biggest dual meets this
year,” Bradshaw said.

St. Bonaventure won the
Eastern Intercollegiate Swim-
ming Conference last year and
returns several swimmers who
were invited to the NCAA
championships last year.

’’If we beat them, then it will
show that our conference is
the strongest in the east this
year.”

Pitt beat St. Bonaventure last I

year in a dual meet at the Bon-
nies’ home pool.

Bradshaw was pleased with
the results from last Saturday's

meet and indicated that all the
swimmers’ times should
decrease on Friday.

”The guys were really swim-
ming for themselves; they
were not really swimming
against anyone. They were
getting good times without do—
ing it against competition.
When we do get some compe-
tition, I expect that we will
swim quite well,” Bradshaw
said.

According to Bradshaw, the
freshmen will continue to see
a lot of action this year.

_”lt’s a unique situation
when you have a freshman
class that can be almost as
good as the whole varsity
team. Quality—wise, it's the
best freshman class that I've
ever had,” he said.

Pitt had 15 freshmen on the
roster Saturday, equaling the
total number of swimmers that
Duquesne sported.

Several freshmen won their
events outright, besting even
the upperclassmen. Dave Mar-
tin finished first in the
200—meter freestyle with a
time of 1:47.92, and Dave
Schepner won the 500-
freestyle with a time of
4:49.56. Schepner and Martin
were also part of the winning
400-freestyle relay team, along
with Mike Pfister and Fred
Constantini, who finished in
3:20.63.

Bradshaw added that Eric
Daum and Eric Mattson, both
high school state champions
last year, will also see con-
siderable action this year.

Bradshaw will also incor-
porate the talents of several
outstanding upperclassmen.
Mike Kozlina, a junior, is cur-
rently ranked 27th in the
world in the backstroke. Kozli-
na is ranked third in the NCAA
and made it to the finals of the
Olympic trials.

Bradshaw said that Pitt

‘should easily win the Big East

again this year.

”It shouldn't be any
problem. Last year we wanted
to amass the biggest number
of points ever at the champi-
onships and we did that. This
year, I guess our goal will be
to win by the biggest margin
ever,” Bradshaw said.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 3, I988

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team starts
competition this month and
Coach Rande Stottlemyer will set-
tle for nothing less than last year's
impressive 15th national ranking.

The team travels to Dayton,
Ohio, on Nov. 19 for the Ohio
Open Tournament. This is the
first of four tournaments Pitt will
wrestle in to prepare them for the
upcoming dual meet season.

One of these tournaments is
the Las Vegas Invitational, which
is competitively comparable to
nationals, according to Coach
Stottlemyer. Perennial NCAA
wrestling powerhouse Iowa State
will also be competing in Las
Vegas.

So the Pitt wrestlers will see
plenty of good competition be-
fore their tough dual meet
season.

Coach Stottlemyer points out
that Nebraska, Penn State, Navy

1987 EWL 134-pound champion Alan Utter is expected to have a successful 1988 campaign.

Wrestling team will use

more depth to improve
on 1987 No. 15 finish

son, which runs through January
and February.

"We have a great schedule.
We'll really be knocking heads
out there. But we basically look
at the dual meet season as a way
to prepare for the tournaments at
the end of the year,” said Stot-
tlemyer.

Stottlemyer was referring to the
Eastern Wrestling League and Na-
tional tournaments held in
March. Last year, Pitt finished
fourth in the Eastern Wrestling
League, missing third by three
points and second by just seven
points. _

But considering the competi-
tive nature of the EWL, a fourth-
place finish is something to be
proud of.

”You can finish fourth or fifth
in the EWL and still be consid-
ered one of the top teams in the
nation,” said Stottlemyer.

The EWL consists of eight of
the top teams in the tri—state area.
Stottlemyer compares the nation-
al recognition of the EWL to the
recognition of the Big East in
basketball.

In fact, the Big 10, the Big 8,
and the EWL are the three best
wrestling conferences in the na-
tion. Penn State, Bloomsburg,
Lock Haven and new addition,
Edinboro, are among the Top
teams in the EWL.

Despite praising last year's
fourth place EWL finish, Stot-
tlemyer still wants to improve on
that and, ideally, take top honors.
He also hopes to improve the
team's national ranking this year.

’'I would like to be in the top
10 this year. This would require
a really good work ethic and a
committment to succeed by
everybody. The team also has to
realize early what they're capable
of doing. Last year's team real-
ized too late how much potential
they had,” said Stottlemyer.

This year's team will have more
experience and possibly be more
exciting than last year.

"These guys will fight to the
bitter end; they'll never feel like
they're out of it,” said Stot-
tlemyer.

Pitt will be without talented
wrestlers Mike Rossi and Mike
Tongel this year due to gradua-
tion. Although they will be
missed, Stottlemyer feels he has
good replacements for them.

In fact, Pitt's outstanding depth
will be one of the wrestling
team's best strengths this year.

’'If someone should get in-
jured, we have enough depth to
fill the gap. There will be a lot of
fighting for weight class spots this
year. No one weight class is
decided yet," said Stottlemyer.

That says a lot, considering Pitt
has some outstanding returning
wrestlers.

Stottlemyer obviously expects
big things from last year's un-
defeated national champion at
142 pounds, Pat Santoro. Santoro
is a three—time All—American and
three—time EWL champion in his
weight class.

Stottlemyer, a former three-
time All—American himself, will
also look for Alan Utter, Scott
Hovan and Jeff Turner to keep up
their impressive performances

‘Undefeated Wyoming has yet to earn respect

Last week was West Virginia's
moment of national glory. This

. week, it's Wyoming's turn. The

9-0 Cowboys’ game against-

UTEP, although not being tele-
vised to the entire nation, will be
televised to some of it on CBS at
2:30 p.m.

Unfortunately, Wyoming, un-
like West Virginia, does not get
to make a name for itself by beat-
ing up on traditional powerhouse
Penn State. The Cowboys must
settle for little-known Texas-El
Paso. But don't sell UTEP short —
an upset ,victory by the Miners
could catapult them into The As-
sociated Press Top 20. They are
_a_solid_ team.

Last week: 7-2 (.778); for the
year: (.699).

Wyoming — 35, UTEP — 20.

If Wyoming goes undefeated,
they will receive some first—place
votes in the polls, but they will
not be crowned No. 1.

UCLA — 44, Oregon — 19.

Oregon is good, but the
UCLAns will be bloodthirsty af-
ter Iast week's season-spoiling
loss to Washington State.

First Upset of the Week:

Baylor - 27, Arkansas — 17.

Arkansas is Cotton Bowl
bound, but they can stop crying
about being undefeated and
ranked only 11th. Baylor drops

232-3553.

Shaw suspended following Lemieux incident,

NEW YORK (AP) — Defense-
man David Shaw of the New
York Rangers was suspended for
12 games on Wednesday by the
National Hockey League for
slashing Pittsburgh Penguins star
Mario Lemieux.

”Although this is the first

_ offense of this nature committed

by Mr. Shaw, he nevertheless
deliberately swung his stick with
two hands in an overhead man-
ner, making contact with and
causing injury to Lemieux,” NHL
executive vice president Brian
O'Neill said.

”His excuse that he retaliated
because he was cross-checked by
Lemieux is totally unacceptable.”

Lemieux, the NHL’s’ leading
scorer, suffered a bruised sternum
from the slash during the third
period of Sunday's Rangers-
Penguins game. He remained
face down on the ice for nearly
five minutes before leaving under
his own power. Shaw received a
five-minute major penalty and a
match penalty.

In Buffalo, N.Y., where the
Rangers were playing on Wed-

nesday night, New York coach‘

Michel Bergeron said he did not
agree with the length of the sus-
pension.

’’I think it's a severe suspen-
sion,” Bergeron said. ”He’s a
clean player. It's the first time he’s
ever used his stick.

”David doesn't have a bad
reputation. He's a great guy. I
would like my son to grow up [to]
be like him.” '

Bergeron called Shaw's suspen-
sion a big loss for the team be-
cause its defense already is
decimated by injuries.

On comments by the Penguins’
Steve Dykstra, who said he
would get Shaw the next time the
two teams meet on Nov. 23,
Bergeron said, ”|t’s very bad. It's
the first time I've seen that kind
of comment, and it's scary.”

Lemieux returned to action on
Tuesday night, scoring two third-
period goals to lead the Penguins

. to a 5-3 victory over the Vancou-

ver Canucks.

Penguins general manager
Tony Esposito said he was some-
what surprised at the length of the
suspension.

”l was a little surprised. I ex-
pected probably around 1O [sus-
pended games]/’ said Esposito,
whose brother is the Rangers’
general manager. ’’I just think in
view of what the other people
have gotten, it was a pretty stiff

  
     
     
    
    

suspension. They said they're go-
ing to try to bear down more on
the stick swinging, and that's a
step in the right direction.

’’I don't think there's a winner
in this situation. [The game itself

P Weiss third straight

‘Ilkin not pleased with second sack .
Rookie of Year forA’s

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— In the
Pittsburgh Steelers’ season of dis-
content, Tunch Ilkin has been an
island of stability, but even the
nine-year veteran offensive tack-
le hasn’t been perfect.

In a 31-14 loss to Phoenix three

gweeks ago, Ilkin allowed the

Cardinals’ Freddie Joe Nunn to
sack quarterback Todd Black-
ledge. It was the first sack Ilkin
has allowed since 1986.

”At first, I said, ‘Well, I guess
[I'd] be naive to think it would last
forever,’ ” Ilkin said. ’’I sat there
and was trying to figure out why
I let that happen. But what are
you going to do? I was disap-
pointed I let it happen; it
bothered me, but I didn't really
think I'd be able to go another
year [without giving up a sack].”

Except for last season's replace-
ment games, the 6-foot-3,

265-pound Ilkin ~ who is rela-
tively undersized for an NFL tack-
le — has started all but two games
the last three seasons. Only twice
has the defender he was assigned
to block recorded a sack.

The statistic is significant since
the Steelers, 2-7, have allowed 22
sacks this season.

”He’s really a good player,”
Steelers’ assistant coach Ron
Blackledge told The Pittsburgh
Press. ”The test of a good player
is not one game or one season.
I think the test of a good player
is the test of time, and Tunch has
passed the test.”

Despite the stability he has
brought to an unstable team, Ilkin
has often felt like he was ”on the
edge” in a sport in which play-
ers are traded, waived, signed
and re-signed daily.

”You’re never really happy

Pitt has had an easier time
recruiting quality wrestlers over
the past_few years.

”We never jump by leaps and
bounds, but we are always mov-
ing forward. lmproving has been
a slow, but consistent process.
Now people realize when they
wrestle someone from the
University of Pittsburgh, they
have to put their chin straps on

with the way you play,” he said.
”No matter how many games
you’ve played in or started, you
can be replaced in a hurry.
They're always bringing in those
big college offensive linemen.’’

Blackledge attributes |lkin’s
longevity — he was a sixth—round
draft pick from Indiana State in
1980 — and continued improve-
ment to his knowledge and con-
fidence, and a maneuver known
as Tunch’s punch.

Ilkin often gets the attention of
defensive ends, and keeps them
away from the quarterback, by a
strong initial thrust of his arms im-
mediately after the snap from
center.

’’I’m a lot tougher mentally
now than at any time in my
career,” said Ilkin, 31. ”I’m a lit-
tle bigger, a little stronger and
a lot slower.”

AP Baseball Writer

NEW YORK — Shortstop
Walt Weiss was selected
American League Rookie of
the Year Wednesday by the
Baseball Writers Association
of America, the third straight
season a member of the Oak-
land Athletics has won the
honor.

Weiss received 103 points
and 1 7 first-place votes from a
panel of 28 writers, two from
each AL city.

Right-hander Bryan Harvey
of the California Angels was
second with 49 points, one
ahead of infielderlody Reed of
the Boston Red Sox. Reed,
however, had six‘first—place
votes to three for Harvey.

Right-hander Don August of

Milwaukee was fourth with 22
points, followed by outfielder
Dave Gallagher of Chicago
with 18, right—hander Melido
Perez of the White Sox with
nine, right—hander Mike
Schooler of Seattle with two
and shortstop Cecil Espy of
Texas with one.

Oakland's Jose Canseco was
Rookie of the Year in 1986
and first baseman Mark
McGwire won the award last
year. While Canseco and
McGwire brought the A's
power, Weiss’ slick fielding
helped Oakland win the AL
pennant

Since the inception of the
award in 1949, no other AL
club has ever had three con-
secutive winners.

The Outrider takes center stage

By Matt Martin
Contributing Editor

Jimmy Page has never been
one to mess with success. The
self—proclaimed innovator of
modern rock guitar has jumped
through nearly three decades of
fame by leaning on the the basis
for nearly all guitar riffs: the blues.

The June release of Outrider,
his first solo project, has done
nothing to harm his reputation. If
anything, it's proved that Page
was not just a marvel of the hard-
rock 705 but is here to stay.

Local fans will get their first
chance to see Page since he
played at the Civic Arena in 1986
with The Firm, when he performs
at the Syria Mosque at 7:30 p.m.
on Wednesday, Nov. 9, in a
DiCesare-Engler production.

Outrider showcases the two
styles that made Page the main-
stay of Led Zeppelin and a guitar
master in the public eye. Side one
features Page's power chords and
unpredictable style in the rock ’n’
roll vein; side two, the blues.

Page’s tour has teamed him
with former Alan Parsons Project
singerjohn Miles, bassist Durban
Laverde and drummerjason Bon-
ham, son of the late Zeppelin
drummer John Bonham, who
also played in the Zep reunion at
the Atlantic Records 40th birth-

day party.

Also featured on the album is
former Zeppelin frontman Robert

Plant (who was in town just

weeks ago), Firm bassist Tony
Franklin and vocalist Chris
Farlowe.

Despite the presence of some
notable musical names, Page's
music is, and always has been,
his own. Page produced all of
Zeppelin’s music and continues
to oversee everything from the
writing of the music to the final

overdub on his current tunes, and
it shows.

Or rather, it echoes.

Page's unmistakable sound has
been carved in the annals of rock
history, from Led Zeppelin to The
Firm to Outrider, and Page appar-
ently saw no reason to change it
now.

A few years ago, Page applaud-
ed the work of Eddie Van Halen,
saying he wished he could play
the guitar like that. He said there
was no way he could ever work
a fretboard like Van Halen.

But Page and Zeppelin fans
would have it no other way.

Vintage Clothing special feature

By Kathy Condit

Staff Writer

ln earlier centuries, clothing
was scarce and valuable. In
those days, used clothing ‘was
sold by peddlers and bought by
the very poor. Today, the idea
of ”vintage" clothing and ac-
cessories has become a high
status concept in the clothing in-
dustry. Vintage clothes are now
worn by college students, col-
lectors and eventhe wealthy.

Vintage clothing as a fashion
statement emerged during the
l970s incitieslike New York,

Paris and London. At that time,
fashion was experiencing a
retro-trend toward styles of the
40s. Desi ners such as Ral h
Lauren cas ed in on the trend by
including old styles in their col-

lections and by marketing vin— .

tage items in their boutiques.
There are many reasons for

‘ the continuedpopularity of vin-
tage clothing. In the era of rela-

tively inexpensive, but poorly
made ready-to-wear clothing,
the classic styles and quality of
period clothing stand out.
Marlene Tabasco, a clerk at
Club Anonymous, says that cur-

rent women's fashions are ”very
similar to the styles of the 305,
405 and 50s in the use of pad-
ding and the hem lengths."

Richard Parsakian, owner, of
EONS, says that a strong theat-
rical community is a traditional
supporter of the vintage clothing
industry because "theatrical
people are very interested in be-
ing unusual and different."

His store is often patronized
by costume designers from local
theaters searching for period
clothing. Clothing from EONS
will be featured in an upcoming
vampire movie, "The Awaken-
ing," starring l\/loon Zappa.

Al Ferrucci, a partner in Hey

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 3, T988 ,

Bettyl, sees movies as an impor-
tant influence on the popularity
of vintage clothing. He feels that
movies such as ”A Room With
a View" reawaken designers’
interest in period styles.

He says that "designers then
design clothing based on old
styles, but the prices are too
high, so people shop vintage
clothing stores to get the same
styles at a much lower price."
Classic films and cultural icons
like James Dean and Marilyn
Monroe shape perceptions of an

era and create demand for cer-

tain styles.
The sources of the vintage
clothing found in stores are

diverse. In the words of Mr. Par-
sakian, ”You're always looking
for anything you can get!”
lvlany store owners travel and
bring in merchandise from other
states and cities. Merchandise is
often purchased directly from
people bringing items to the
shop, estate sales and other
stores.

- l\/lr. Parsakian remembers buy-
ing some fun items at a costume
company's liquidation sale: ’’I
bought a pair of pants l still
have, pleated turquoise cordu-
rays with a red and black pick-
up-sticks design.”

Today, vintage clothing oc-
cupies a prominent place in the
wardrobes of many college stu-
dents. Vintage clothing can
satisfy the wearer's desire to be
unique while it displays fashion
consciousness. 'l\/lany stores

stock accessories, such as hats, ,

jewelry and shoes, thus allowing
the creation of a complete
"look."

It is important to be selective
when purchasing vintage items.

.Since most clothing has been

worn, it is important to check
garments for stains and holes.’
l\/lost stores mark ”As, |s" on the
garment’s tag if there are any
defects.- g

You should check the stitching
and reinforcing of seams to
make sure that the item will last.
Care instructions for the fabric
are important, since many items

debut, utilizing his rich, stunning
photographic techniques to em-
phasize the dark sadness in_

lMol|y's environment and how

the savage world looks through
the eyes of a confused and trou-
bled little girl.

A World Apart also contains
some extremely well-crafted act-
ing. lodhi May is absolutely won-
derful in her first screen role as
Molly. She is anything but
another one of those boring and

unbelievable child actors from V

Britain. She speaks convincingly
in every sceneand is one of the
main carrying forces of the film.
Barbara Hershey is outstanding
as Diana Roth. Both eloquent and
alarmingly beautiful, she has
mastered a perfect British accent
and evokes an emotional inten-
sity about her that is wonderfully
touching. It is possibly one of her
best performances to date. (Both
she and May ‘shared this year's
Best Actress award at Cannes.)

A A World Apart is undeniably

more than just a. family chronicle.
It's a poignant, heartfelt movie

' about the abhorrent conditions of

racism and apartheid in South
Africa, a situation that continues
beyond the intense background
of 1963 into our present day. Its
focus on the political activism of
the period echoes a frightening
vision of the inhuman suffering of
a nation and further induces a
deeply affecting concern for hu-
man survival. ‘

EONS, in a new location at
5850 Ellsworth Ave., Shady-
side, specializes in fashion from
the l920s through the l9oOs.
Parsakian characterizes EONS
as a ”mini-department store"
where a customer can ”dress
from head to toe." He can help
customers put outfits together if
they have an idea of what they
want. Among the unique items
seen at EONS were a leopard
cape and a full—length pink gown
with a bubbled overskirt of
chiffon.

Souvenirs, two doors down-

I4 William Pitt Union.

A terrible injustice which ques-
tions the morals of our vice presi-
dent, Mr. George Bush, has been
brought to my attention. He has
refused to correct a wrong com-
mitted by his father.

As a young man, Mr. Bush's
father led a party of grave rob-
bers, who chose Geronimo as
their victim.

George Bush's lack of concern
and sympathy in this situation dis-
tresses me. He has failed to aid
the American Indians in their at-
tempt to put one of their ances-
tors to- rest. 0

First, let me describe the man
who is at the center of this
debate. \

Geronimo was the leader of the
Chiracua tribe of the North

. American Apache Indians. After

his wife, children and mother
were killed by Mexicans, he par-
ticipated in a number of raids
against American and Mexican
settlers.

After years of warfare, the
Apaches were placed on reserva-
tions where most of them settled
peacefully into a new life.
However, Geronimo and his
band escaped to Mexico.

He sporadically continued

Credit can

While walking through the Un-
ion a couple of weeks ago, I saw
a couple of tables with a number
of inviting pamphlets offering col-
lege students a credit card — with
a $1,000 credit limit!

I didn't even bother reading it.
I have worked at a bank, and I
know all about credit cards. And
for a student _who is already
several thousand dollars in debt,
a credit card is not a wise in-
vestment. ,-

But people get them. .

It is amazing how little people

think about credit, whether with

a credit card or when buying a
car. For instance, when buying a
car, people think that what they
can afford is what they can bor-
row from a bank to pay for the
car.

Wrong.

To better explain the conse-
quences of buying a car on credit,
here is a formula I made up: cost
of owning a car per~year equals
the cost of the car minus the sell-
ing price of the car divided by the
number of years you've owned it.

For example, if I buy a $10,000
car, own it for two years, and
then sell it for $5,000, that equals
$2,500 per year.

_Here is an exa‘mple of the

raids on white settlers until he
was forced to surrender by the
combined military forces of Ari-
zona, New Mexico and western
Texas. 1
He was later taken to Fort Sill,
Okla., where he eventually was
buried. However, this would not
prove to be his final resting place.

father, Prescott Bush, led a group

of soldiers on a prank, desecrat— '

ed Geronimo’s tomb, and made
off with his skull, according to the
Cherokee One Feather, a week-
ly periodical concerning Ameri-
can Indian affairs.

This act seems to illustrate nice-
ly the sentiment that I believe
those men were entertaining. To
those pranksters, this dead Indi-
an was nothing more than a
curiosity.

They never thought of Geroni-
moas a man, nor did they con-

were breaking.

and could no longer makepay—

ed to sell it and pay the rest of
what she owed on the car,with
the money she made selling it:

She had already dished out
$15,000 in payments and then
found out that she still owed
another $15,000!

In short, she paid $32,000 for
a car worth $16,000. She sold it

Remains of Indian deserve more respect

Bones Society of Yale — of which
Prescott Bush was a member.

This seems to be a rather
strange resting place for a man
who has made such an incredi-
ble mark on history.

We must look beyond the fact
that Geronimo launched his at-
tack against white and Mexican
settlers. ‘

Remember that these settlers
were the people who massacred
his family and overran his land.
He was fighting for what he be-
lieved to be justice.

Concerned American Indians
have been trying to procure the
skull in order to put Geronimo to
rest. .

On one occasion, they were
offered a skull by the society
which later proved to be a fake.

In the hopes that George Bush
would exert his influence on their
behalf, the Indians have tried to
meet with him. They also have
petitioned him with letters.

He continually refuses to help
or acknowledge them concerning
this matter.

Mr. Bush does not seem to
be concerned with the American
Indians, due to their lack of pow-
er in the voting booths.

for $9,000. That means she paid
$10,000 a year to own that car.

‘ If she had bought it outright for

$16,000 and sold it for $9,000,
it would have cost her just under
$3,000 a year. A

Here is an example of the right
way to buy a car: In 1984, my
dad bought, and paid upfront for,
an '82 Toyota Supra for $8,000.

_Today, he could probably sell it

for $3,000. That's $5,000 over
four years — only $1,250 a year.

‘What this all means is that peo-
ple should try to pay cash for a
car (unless, of course, you feel
like buying one car for the price
of two).

The allure of buying a car on
credit is that it makes it look as
if you'can afford a more expen-
sive car when in fact you can't.

Credit cards have a similar
charm. The ones being_offered
seem to be giving you an extra
-$1,000, but they actually would
cost you up to $200 a year.

This isn't to say that credit cards
are totally without value. You just
have to use them properly. This
simply means pay the bills on
time. If you do, then youV\don’t
have to pay any extra niohey to
the bank. If you don't pay on

I wonder what sort of charac-
ter this man possesses if he con-
centrates on his own ambitions

and ignores ethical issues con- ’

cerning the American Indians.

’’It has been standard proce-

dure for some people to steal our
bones,” said Mr. Louis Grey Owl
Benton, deputy conservation
officer of Washington County,
Pa., who is a member of the
Cherokee tribe. ”One individual
was even selling bones made into
buttons.” ,

I wonder how you would feel
if someone was wearing the re-
mains of your great grandmother
on his coat.

When asked how he felt about
George Bush, Mr. Benton, while
stating that he could not speak for
every American Indian, said,
”The Republicans are for the rich
people; if they elect another
Republican, it's their fault.”

George Bush's failure to assist
the Indians seems to be a strange
way for a presidential candidate
to act with the Nov. 8 election
looming on the horizon.

Please, Mr. Bush, I have seen

enough ads with children run— 2’

ning into your caring arms.

it's worth

time, then most banks charge I

around a 20 percent interestrate.

The trap is like the one with the

car: the credit card makes it seem .0

as if you can afford to buy more.

You can charge up to your‘

$1,000 credit limit, and the com-
pany will only ask for a minimum.
payment of $20 to $60 a month.

At my bank, some of the credit ,

limits went as high as $10,000.

People would charge up to the

limit and pay the monthly mini-
mum. Usually, this minimum is
just enough to cover the interest.

In five years, these people
would have each lost the mone-
tary equivalent of a brand-new
car.

As I said before, credit cards are

not necessarily costly if used '

wisely. Unfortunately, most peo-
ple do not use them in this way,
and the banks, who are making
big bucks from these people, are
certainly not going to warn them.
Don't let the urge for instant
gratification lure you into throw-
ing your money away. —

The random ramblings of a little sister

I checked my calendar —-

twenty days til Thanksgiving
break. Yeah. In the meantime,
I've got a few things on my mind.

I I was discussing politics
with three of my friends a few
weeks ago. I plan to vote for
Dukakis, my roommate is going
to vote for Bush (if she gets
around to it), her boyfriend is vot-
ing for Ron Paul (even though
Americans would never elect a
man with two first names) and
another friend of ours, who was
completely apathetic about the
entire politial situation, wasn't
planning to vote at all. He
brought up a rather interesting

point. He said, ”Your votes will
cancel each other out.” We
laughed, but I guess he’s right.

I Speaking of the election, I
wonder what it will be like to
have a new president. Ronald
Reagan has been in office since
I was in Elementary School.

I And speaking of Elementary
School, I think Michelle Madoff
was seen pulling Ben Woods’
hair yesterday.

I It's funny to see U2 ”rebe|s”
everywhere. Wow, what a state-
ment of originality, getting into
the world's most popular band.

I How about that SGB elec-
tion? If I could only decide who
to vote for for president. -

I Someone please explain to .

me’ how it is that ”Hollywood
kids” grow up so quickly? Take
Emmanuel Lewis for example. I
thought I'd read in TV Guide that
he was six years old just three or
four years ago. Now all of a sud-
den he’s nineteen? How is that?
And those kids from Stand By Me
are quickly passing me by in age.
I wonder....

skating
rink

By - Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

it's time to hit the ice again at
the Schenley Park ice) skating

rink, where skating season opens .

this Saturday, Nov. 5.
’’Currently, we're in the

process of making ice, but we

plan to open the rink on Nov. 5,”

stated Bill Backa, Citiparks pub-

lic relations coordinator.
According to Backa, the Schen-

‘Qley Park ice skating rink accom-

modates approximately 500 to
600 people. Last year, the rink’s
big skate held about 605 people,
he said. 1

”Some people bring their
skates — about a quarter —_ and
about three—quarters rent. We
have plenty of skates for anyone
who needs them,” Backa said.

This year a $2 admission rate
is the price to skate for adults, age
19 and over. For senior citizens

' and youths, 18 and under, the

price is $1. The charge for non-
resident adults is $3. Skate rental
costs $1, and skate sharpening
costs $2.

On Wednesday afternoons,
from 1 to 3:30 p.m., a special
skating session is limited to adults
only. Also, on Friday and Satur-
day evenings, additional adult-
only session sessions are held
from 10 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.

According to Backa, Citiparks
has added two ”learn to skate"
classes on Monday and Thursday
evenings, taught by professional
instructors.

O" The classes begin the week of

Nov. 21 from .7 to 8:30 p.m. The
first hour is instruction followed
by a half—hour of supervised prac-
tice time.

The ’’learn to skate” classes
teach the fundamental skills of
ice skating, such as proper loco-
motion, backward movement
and forward crossovers.

Citiparks also offers a ’’learn to
play hockey” program, beginning
on Monday, Nov. 21, from 4 to
6:30 p.m.

New this year is a session for
skaters who have completed the
basics of ice skating and want to
learn more skillful moves. Citi-
parks, along with the Pittsburgh
Figure Skating Club, is offering
advanced figure—skating sessions.
These sessions begin on Nov. 12

J from 11 to 11:45 a.m. or 11:45
a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

For each of the sessions, regis-
tration is required and a fee is
charged.

According to Backa, during the
month of November, a special
skating event, Skate With the
Penguins, will take place. Details
are still being prepared for this

.0 €VE'l'Tl.

Backa is also planning a Pitt
skating night with the Pitt Pro-
gram Council for January.

ing the Schenley Park ice skating

Poetry is an assertion of hu-
man creativity, human digni-
ty and human rights, accord-
ing to Professor Dennis Brutus
of the Third Annual Interna-
tional . Human Rights Day
Poetry Contest.

The contest is open to high
school and college students
and is sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh En-
glish department, the Thomas
and Dorothy Szep Foundation
(anon-profit poetry organiza-
tion) and Pitt's Department of
Black Community Education,
Research and Development,
of which Brutus is the
chairman. a

Human Rights Day com-
memorates the signing of the
International Declaration of
Human Rights on Dec. 10,
1948. While it is celebrated all
over the world, the holiday
does not receive wide public-
ity in the United States be-
cause, according to Dr. John
Cutler of the United Nations
Association,
about [human rights viola-
tions], but they haven't ex-
perienced it.” -

Winners in the high school
and college categories will be
invited to read their poems at
the Third Annual Internation-
al Human Rights Day Poetry
Festival on Dec. 10 at the Frick

”people read ‘

Fine Arts Auditorium.

Pittsburgh poets Ann Sawyer
Berkley, Lynn Emanuel and
Valerie Lawrence will read
their own poetry at the festival
as well.

The entry deadline is Nov.
18, and only one poem per
student may be submitted. Ac-
cording to Rachel Zepp of the
Szep Foundation, this is due to
the lack of time available to
choose a winner.

Dr. Brutus founded the
poetry festival three years ago
in conjunction with the black
studies department. Since
then, the Szep Foundation and
the UNA have sponsored the
festival as well. This year, it
has not yet been confirmed if
the UNA is sponsoring the
contest.

While the contest is open to
all high school and college
students, Zepp said response
to the contest has been “good
from some schools, not good
from others.”

The Szep Foundation, in ad-
dition to the Human Rights
Poetry Festival, also sponsors
the Fourth River Poetry Fes-
tival every September, on

Sharpeville Day (in conjunc- -
tion with Pitt's department of_

black studies).

This year, the Szep Founda-
tion sponsored a centenary
celebration to honor the Pitts-
burgh poet Haniel Long.

A discriminatory trend in the
promotion and tenure of women
and minority" faculty at Pitt has
been reported to the Faculty As-
sembly by the university Senate
committee on affirmative action.

Barbara Shore, chairwoman of
the committee, addressed this
concern at the university Senate
meeting on Tuesday.

Shore said there is a need for
the university to not only hire
women and minority faculty at
equitable salaries, but to ’’alter
historic behavior by enhancing
their ability to receive promotion
and tenure.”

”Minority and women candi-
dates who are recruited [by Pitt]
often find that all else is not
necessarily equal," Shore said.
She said that ”supports need to
be in place” to help\these faculty
members.

Addressing the concerns of
some faculty members that this
would lead to ”reverse discrimi-

nation,” Senate President Herbert
Chesler said that since ”the

university does not have a set sa-

lary structure  reverse discrimi-
nation will almost never occur.”
Chesler said Pitt does not have
upper or lower limits on starting
salaries for each faculty rank.
In other business, the faculty

assembly passed Professor.

Leonard Plotnicov’s motion for
the Executive Committee of the
university Senate to ”consider the
function and value of full univer-
sity Senate meetings with the
view of more effective participa-
tion and use.”

”We’re never going to get peo-
ple involved as long as all we
have [at full Senate meetings] is
the administration talking to us,”
said one faculty member.

Approximately 35 people at-
tended the last full meeting of the
university Senate, which is com-
prised of full—time -university
faculty, tenured part—time faculty,
administrators and selected
students.

Pampena said if the department
would revise its policy of hiring
only current city residents,
officers from other communities
would have the opportunity to
apply for positions with the city
police.

"We'd have people who are al-
ready tested and trained in other
departments,” he explained.

”Civilianization” is another of
Pampena’s ideas to alleviate
manpower shortages. This plan
would put civilians in jobs cur-
rently filled by police officers in
areas such as traffic management
and record keeping.

"A lot of civilians are probably
better qualified in some instances
than trained police officers for
jobs in certain areas,” he said.

SCB discusses improvements for phone service

By Stephanie Myers
Staff Writer

More information on possible
alternatives to the current STS tel-
ephone system is being obtained
by Pamela Rich, member of the
Student Government Board.

At the 5GB meeting last night,
Rich explained that her idea for
alternatives came about when
she interviewed a student at the
University of Pennsylvania about
its telephone system.

At Penn, students are only al-
lowed to use their access codes
in their own rooms. Each room-
mate has an individual code. The
individual access codes are dis-

played on the phone bill with
their respective phone numbers.

According to Rich, Penn has
had no problems with this type of
phone system.

Rich also said that if this system
were implemented at Pitt, it
would alleviate the concern
roommates have splitting the cost

\ of telephone bills.

"Most of the time you don't
make long distance phone calls
from someone else’s room any-
way," stated Rich.

Rich added that she'll meet
with Marlin Pease of Central Bus-
iness Services to discuss this issue
further.

Rich explained that the reason

STS developed the seven-digit ac-
cess code was to allow each in-
dividual roommate his own bill.
She is currently focusing on
eliminating the credit limit system
and converting to the old system
of having a regular phone bill.
In other business, SGB member
K-yle Durham said that while at-
tending a Mid—Atlantic Confer-
ence Association convention, she
looked into adding more health
education classes at Pitt.
Deborah Sutton, a speaker at
the conference, gave Durham in-

formation on how to submit a ‘

case to the administration for the
addition of such classes. Durham
will be discussing this issue fur-

ther with the Health Education
Office.

Thisweek, SGB member Kurt
Toll attended the Food Service
Committeemeeting. This com—
mittee is open to all resident stu-
dents who wish to voice their
concerns. It meets on the first
Tuesday of each month at 4 p.m.
in the Tower A conference room.

Toll voiced complaints which
he had received concerning the
closing time of the cafeterias and
the removal of various, items from
the line. He also brought up is-

sues concerning the use of the ~

cafeteria as a study area and im-
proving the deli line.

those office hours, call and I'll

you at anytime, wherever [it]
is convenient for you," Jill
Phillips said during her open-
ing address.

An issue brought up by
presidential candidate Kent
Baldauf, and later stressed by

Erik Sossman, was concerning
foreign teaching assistants.
Both Baldauf and Sossman felt
that something must be done
to improve the English profi-
ciency of foreign T.A.s, since
there are too many complaints
that students cannot under-
stand the material they are be-
ing taught.

be a long term problem,” Bal-
dauf said.

’’I think something has to be
done about foreign T.A.s,"
Sossmansaid, "After all, we're
here at the university to learn,
and if you can't understand
what someone’s saying, then
they shouldn't get renewed
under the [present] process
where foreign T.A.s get
renewed."

Under questioning from stu-
dents on the problem of for-
eign T.A. language profi-
ciency, Sossman said that the
way to bring the problem to
the administration's attention
is to boycott individual
classes.

Sossman proposed that stu-
dents with a grievance about
their T.A. should bring the
problem to the SGB’s atten-
tion. The board would then in-
vestigate the problem, bring it
to the administration's atten-
tion and then inform students
to boycott the class until the
administration acted.
