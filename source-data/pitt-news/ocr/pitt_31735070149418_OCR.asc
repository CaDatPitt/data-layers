Pulling all-nighters can produce opposite of desired effect

Imaz Athar
Staﬁ’ W riter

For Rob Narayana, late nights have
become common in college, and
all-nighters have, at times, become
a necessity to review all of his notes.

“My reasoning is that if I don’t
stay up all night to cover all of the
necessary material, I essentially have
no chance to get the questions right
on an exam,” said Narayana, a pre-
med freshman and ﬁnance major. “If
I do pull an all nighter, I at least can
formulate some sort of educational
guess.” ,

With the number of exams to
study for and papers to write, ﬁnals
week can be very stressful. In order
to meet the demands of this stress,
students often resort to pulling all-
nighters. Although staying up all
night might be worth it to get work
done, experts say the negative health
consequences of all-nighters render
them useless.

There are plenty of reasons why
Narayana feels tired and inattentive
after a night of no sleep.

According to Peter Franzen, an
associate professor of psychiatry at
Pitt, all-nighters are not beneﬁcial
to anyone.

Negative consequences of sleep
loss “include cognitive deﬁcits, in-
cluding memory problems.” This,
he said, is “counter-productive for

studying purposes” because memo-
rization is a vital part of studying.

Dr. Marni Greenwald, assistant
medical director of Pitt’s medical
service clinic, agrees with Franzen
and said she believes that sleep helps
the “brain work properly.” Like Fran-
zen, Greenwald also feels that a lack
ofsleep can diminish students’ per-
formance on school work because
“people who are sleep deﬁcient 
take longer to ﬁnish tasks, have a
slower reaction time and make more
mistakes.”

The belief that students perform
more poorly without sleep has been
conﬁrmed by a group of research-
ers at the University of California-
Berkeley. According to Matt Walker,
an associate professor of psychology
at University of California-Berkeley, a
lack of sleep prevents students from
learning new facts, and it causes a
signiﬁcant decrease in performance
on exams.

“The impairments range from
20 to 40 percent,” Walker said in an
email. “That’s the difference between
anAandaD inanexam.”

Even when pulling all-nighters
seems necessary, Greenwald believes
students should avoid staying up late
because the consequences are hard
to avoid.

Franzen said that if a student was
seriously considering an all—nighter,
being well-rested prior to pulling an

at doing well on an exam. Farha All | staff Photographer

all-nighter can help to limit the nega-
tive effects, although those effects
can’t be completely evaded.

“The better rested a person is
going into a period of sleep loss, the
better they will do,” Franzen said.

While all-nighters have their neg-
ative effects, this doesn’t deter some
students. Jackie Arvay, a freshman,
stays up all night three times a week,
and she doesn’t believe it affects her
performance on school work.

“I don’t think it changes any-
thing,” Arvay said. “Personally, I
think it helps. It’s more time to study.”

In preparation for ﬁnals, some
students stock up on Red Bull, Star-

bucks or other caffeinated drinks.
But for some students, Adderall is
an alternative.

According to the 2009 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.4
percent of ﬁill-time college students
ages 18 to 22 misused Adderall that
year. The number didn’t include stu-
dents diagnosed with an attention
deﬁcit disorder, even though experts
claim that some students fake symp-
toms to obtain the pills. S

Greenwald advised against stu-
dents taking the drug if a doctor did
not prescribe it because its side ef'—
fects can be very damaging to the
body. Adderall can cause many life-

threatening reactions, such as heart
attack, seizure and stroke.

Energy drinks help people stay
up all night because, according to
Franzen, the caffeine helps “prolong
wakefulness.” Greenwald agreed,
adding that caffeine can “improve
concentration and focus in the short
term.”

Although energy drinks can aid
in pulling all-nighters, drinking too
many is harmﬁil. Energy drinks con-
tain a large amount of caffeine and,
according to Greenwald, consuming
too much of it can lead to a number

of health problems, including ujiset V

stomach, palpitations and muscle
tremors. Greenwald said that an oc-
casional energy drink is ﬁne, none-
theless. According to her, it’s impor-
tant to “limit yourself to 16 ounces
a day.” Energy drinks have notes on
them that describe how much should
generally beconsumed within a cer-
taintime period before consumption
becomes dangerous.

Although there are some beneﬁts
to pulling an all—nighter, Narayana
believes staying up all night nega-
tively impacts his behavior and per-
formance inschool the following day.

“All-nighters usually make it hard
for me to recallsome things that I
knowl have studied or memorized,”
Narayana said. “I’m usually groggy
during the test, and my mind is not
the most attentive that it could be.”

Library transforms into ‘Club Hillman’ during ﬁnals

‘Cassidy Davis
Staff Writer

Around noon on a recent Sunday,
Maddie Starkey and friends were
spotted giggling to each other
across a table ﬁlled with books,
laptops and caffeinated drinks.
“There ain’t no party like a
Hillman party, cause the Hillman
party is mandatory,” said Starkey,
a second-year grad student study-
ing audiology, who was enjoying
her stay at the Hillman Library by
quoting “30 Rock” with her friends.
Every year, ﬁnals week comes
around, and Hillman Library slowly

decreases in productivity as people-

begin socializing, more than they
actually study. With over—tired stu-
dents fueled by caffeine surrounded
by their friends and stressing over
ﬁnals, how can anything get done
in Hillman Library?

For most students, it’s a balanc-
ing act.

Starkey said that this Sunday,
she and her group of friends have
been pretty productive as they share
notes, sitting around a table dressed
in comfy clothes, ready to study. She
also said that she doesn’t think that
the library is the place to be during
ﬁnals because it can be so crowded.

Although Hillman Library is not
usually open 24/7, as some students
request, an exception is made dur-
ing ﬁnals week to allow students
the opportunity to study all night
long. The Cup and Chaucer cafe on
the ground floor keepsstudents

motivated by offering free coffee
and tea during the hours of 7:30 and
8:30 a.m. and between 10 p.m. and
2 a.m. As soon as the word “free”
is advertised, a line of students ﬁle
down to receive that extra boost of

‘ caffeine.

Steve Laughran, a senior psy-
chology major, said he generally
uses Hillman as a study spot, and
he likes to study wherever he can
ﬁnd an open table. On the same
Sunday morning that Starkey and
her friends were studying, Laughran
sat with a friend on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
of Hillman, ignoring the textbooks
that surrounded them and sharing
sports stats. They cracked jokes
back and forth while enjoying a
study break.

“The closer it gets to ﬁnals week,
the less productive it gets here on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor, because where more
people are, the less productive I
am,” Laughran said.

He said that he would rather
study at home, but he simply carmot
focus there. He used to study in the
Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral
of Learning, but that didn’t last long.

“The janitors used to chase me

out in random hours of the nigh ,”
Laughran said.

He also recounted one time
when he went to the bathroom, and
they locked his stuff in a Nationality
Room. He then had to go ﬁnd a jani-
tor to unlock the room so he could
retrieve his belongings.

He recommends the library
because it will not randomly close
on you.

“I can make my own rules and
dictate my own hours at the library,”
Laughran said.

He said that if you actually have
a sense of productivity, then you
could get things done at the library.
However, there are many who come
to the library without that motiva-
tion.

“The people who make it Club
Hillman are the ones who have no

desire to study, who come to say hi i

to all their friends,” Laughran said.

Two friends, Nikki Caruso, a
sophomore biology major, and
Mike Householder, an undecided
sophomore in the business school,
said that they could relate to the
common argument that Hillman
is overﬂowing with students at the
end of the semester. Sitting at a
table ﬁlled with friends and their
textbooks, the group laughed while
discussing the craziness that occurs
around ﬁnals time. .

“I saw a kid studying in the bath-
room one time,” Householder said,
explaining that he found a student
studying against the wall by himself.

Caruso chimed in, saying that
one time while she was studying
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Hillman, one
student interrupted the quiet by
farting really loudly. V

“No one could really laugh be-
cause everyone was trying to be
quiet,” Caruso said. I

When Alex Danzey retumed to his
apartment last winter break, there
was more than the unusual assort-
ment of stocking stuffers waiting for
him. Upon entering his bedroom, a
stranger jumped on Danzey’s back.

Danzey said the man let out an
animalistic roar, apparently with the
intention to scare Danzey away. The
man repeated, “Give me your f"‘cking
wallet” several times during the en-
suing one- to two—minute scuffle.

“I ended up turning him around
and pushing him into a wall,” Dan-
zey said. “Then I guess he decided
it wasn’t worth it, and he ran out.”

Many students go out of town
over winter break, leaving their
houses and apartments unattended
for weeks. Though burglaries in col-
lege neighborhoods like Oakland do
increase over breaks, students can
take some easy steps to reduce the
likelihood of coming home to ﬁnd
their belongings missing.

According to the campus crime
report, 16 burglaries were reported
to University police in 2011. In 2009
and 2010, the department received
23 and 45 reports, respectively.

Though University police may as-
sist in responding to these burglaries,
the department refers reports to city
police.

University spokesman John
Fedele said Pitt police conduct ad-
ditional patrols on campus during

December 10, 2012 I The Pitt News | vwx/vv.pittnevve.c0m

Students, police share crime prevention tips for break

breaks. He said that because Uni-
versity residence halls are secured,
these burglaries occur off campus, as
was the case with Danzey.

Danzey, now a senior ﬁnance ma-
jor, said he had merely stopped by
his apartment on N. Craig Street last
winter to pick up a few items when
the burglar ambushed him.

When Danzey entered his apart-
ment the intruderwas attempting to
pour Danzey’s mason jar of change
into a Crown Royal bag. Although
the intrude dropped the bag full of
change, other items were missing.

Danzey said the man wasn’t car-
rying the missing Xbox or half—ﬁill
handle of Jack Daniels when he ran
out the door. He concluded that the
man or another party must have en-
tered through the bedroom window
to the ﬁrst-ﬂoor apartment at least
once before the burglary thatDanzey
interrupted. .

Danzey said he was “impressed”
by the police response. Immediately
after the man ﬂed Danzey’s apart-
ment, Danzey placed an emergency
call. Pittsburghpolice officers arrived
on the scene in about 15 minutes.

Because the incident included an
attempted assault against Danzey,
a detective was placed in charge of
the case.

Though the detective checked
back in with Danzey multiple times
to keep him informed about the
case, the missing items were never
recovered.

While statistics regarding an in-

crease in crime over winter break
were not readily available, Sgt. Kevin
Gasiorowski of the Pittsburgh Police
Burglary Squad said that burglaries
in neighborhoods that, like Oakland,
are located near college campuses,
increase “like clockwork” during
school breaks.

{‘Burglars, the really smart ones,
know when students will be away,”
he said. “And they know some of
these [burglaries] are not going to
be prosecuted because by the time
it goes to trial, the students will not
be around [to testify] .”

Danzey is not the only student to
sufferabreak-in duringaUniversity
holiday. _

This year Alyssa Wehrenberg, a
senior nursing major, came home
afterThanksgivingbreak to ﬁnd that
a diamond necklace and some other

jewelry, worth a total of several hun-
dred dollars, had been stolen from
her ﬁrst-ﬂoor bedroom.

She "said that a few hundred dol-
lars in change, which she had saved
over several years — mostly from
tips she received at the restaurant
where she works -— had also been
stolen from her apartment in South
Oakland. .

She said the blinds over her bed-
room window had been “disturbed,”
indicating the intruder’s possible
entrance.

She chose not to report the crime
to the police.

“What was taken obviously
couldn’t be replaced by renter’s in-

surance, so I didn’tthink itwas really
worth it,” said Wehrenberg, explain-
ing that the necklace was a gift.

Gasiorowski said students com-
monly hesitate to report crimes, of-
ten because they never expect their
items to be recovered.

While the national clearance
rate — the percentage of reported
crimes that eventually result in suc-
cessful prosecution — falls at only
11 percent, Gasiorowski stressed the
importance of reporting burglaries
to law enforcement.

He also said many of those who
fall victim to break-ins fear retali-
ation and eventually choose not to

testify in court, which hinders suc- '

cessful prosecution.

While Gasiorowski stressed that
he understands these concerns, he
believes that they are unfounded.

“I’ve been doing this a long time,
and I’ve never had anyone intimidate
or come back at a witness,” he said.

Gasiorowski encourages anyone
who has fallen victim to a break-in
to report the crime. He also said that
students can take steps to keep their
belongings safe.

Gasiorowski has known of rob-
beries in which students were not
the targets, includinga case in which
the victim left home without drawing
his or her curtains, making it easy to
spot valuable items such as a laptop.
Closing the curtains or blinds can
often go a long way in preventing
such a robbery.

Gasiorowski stressed that while

robberies do occasionally turn vio-
lent, most burglars are opportunistic
and seek to take what they can grab
without a confrontation.

Simply setting a timer that turns
on a light, radio or other electronic
in a house or apartment, making it
appear as though the residents are
still in town, might turn the dwell-
ing from an easy to a more difﬁcult
target.

Wehrenberg said she intends to
take anything that holds value with
her when she leaves during the up-
coming winter break. Though she
believes that she checked every lock
last time, she intends to “double- and
triple-check” this time.

Danzey also had advice for Pitt
students who plan to leave their
apartments and want to keep in-
truders out.

“Deﬁnitely check window bars. I
think anyone living on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
should have them.”

Though his windows had bars, he
believed the intruder who attacked
him had managed to force open the
low-quality lock that secured one of
them.

0 Though Wehrenberg might take
extra precautions before she leaves
on the upcoming break, the break-in
she suffered during the last holiday
will not be easily forgotten.

“It bothers me,” she said. “I mean,
they’re my things, and it bothers
me when someone was in my house
when Iwasn’t there. But there’s noth-
ingl can really do about itnow.” I

Police investigating instances of graﬂiti on campus property

A Pitt maintenance
attempts to remove graffiti from
the Schenley Quad steps last
week. Amy Friedenberger j Editor in
Chief

worker

Aaron Stier—Cohen
Staff Wrz'ter

Pitt police are investigating several

reports of graffiti on Pitt’s campus.

On Nov. 26 and more recently on
Dec. 1, Pitt police received reports
of vandalism on the Bouquet-side
entrance of Posvar Hall and on the
steps leading up the Schenley Quad,
respectively. The graffiti was done
in red spray paint and appeared to
be signed with the letters “CHC.”
Both the writing on Posvar and on
the Schenley Quad steps consisted
primarily of the phrase, “Nothing is
real” and contained the letter A in a
circle, which is a common symbol for
anarchy.

Pitt police did not want to speciﬁ-
cally comment on the current investi-
gation, but detective Steve Cetra did
say that the vast majority of graffiti
that Pitt police investigates is com-
mitted by people not affiliated with

the University.“Most of the people
that we’ve had dealings with [in past

1 instances of grafﬁti] were not affili-

ated with the University,” Cetra said.
Pitt’s Senior Manager of Mainte-
nance Pat Bigley conﬁrmed Cetra’s
assertion, sayingthat students writing
on University property have a ten-
dency to use chalk, which accordingto
Panther Central, is permitted on side-
walks. If the chalk doesn’t wash away
inthe rain, maintenance can generally
remove it with a garden hose. Paint,
however, presents abigger challenge.
“We have a chemical we spray on
it to help loosen up the paint,” Bigley
said. “We’ll let that sit for ﬁve, ten
minutes, and thenwe take apressure
washer and wash it off.” I
Bigley said the graffiti on Posvar
was hastily done and included only
a thin layer of paint, so it came of
fairly easily.
“Because of the high proﬁle of
where these people are taggingbuild-

ings, it’s not like some of the more
beautiful, detailed graﬂiti you see on
some bridges orbridge underpasses.”

The removal process took about
two hours and cost the school about
$100.

“Its not signiﬁcant,” Bigley said,
“butwe’d obviously rather spend that
money elsewhere.”

Insigniﬁcant or not, graffiti is still
a crime. Vandalism, if the cost of the
damage is in excess of $5,000, is a
felony of the third degree. Ifit is not
in excess of that amount, the charge is
amisdemeanor of the second degree.

So, before Bigley’s staff comes in
to remove it, the Pitt police force has
to take alook. »

“We document all that,” Cetra said.
“We take photographs, and usually
what we do is compare it to other
cases to see if it’s the same tagger,
and usually we forward everything
to the Pittsburgh Graffiti Task Force.
We work real closely with them.” *

Created in 2006, the Pittsburgh
city police’s Graﬁili Task Force works
closely with the Department of Public
Works and a digital track-
ing system, allowing them to docu-
ment, reference and match different

Through collaborating with the
city, Pitt police ofﬁcers have access to
the taskforce’s tracking systemaswell
as to grafliti experts who can more
ably detect patterns and differences
intags.

But, according to Pitt spokesman
John Fedele, such a thorou inves-
tigation into these recent cases is
unlikely. i I

“In speaking to my sources, they
say that they haven’t seen a rash of
[graffiti] lately,” Fedele said. “Being on
anurban campus, it’s goingto happen
from timeto time. When it does hap-
pen, facilities or maintenance people
for each building deal with it as best
they can.” I '

challenged over the course of their year—long
terms.

This yearthe 2012 Board, led by Board Presi-
dentjames Landreneau, completedsome initia-
tives, altered others and will pass some on for
future student leaders to pursue. But although
not every original goal was met, new needs
and projects arose over the course of the year
that SGB members saw to as they appeared.
The string of bomb threats across campus last
spring presented the most obvious example,
but the Collegiate Readership Program, the
University’s transgender policy, SGB’s Green
Fund Advisory Board, space usage inthe O’Hara
Student Center and on— campus student voting
all represented other pressing issues the Board
members worked to address.

As their terms as official undergraduate stu-
dent representatives come to a close, the 2012
Board members discussed the status of their
initial projects and the work left to be continued
by future student leaders.

James Landreneau

 

President Landreneau ran on the initia-
tives of creating an SGB liaison system, holding

monthly town hall meetings and creating an .

on—campus leadership summit. He described
himselfas going 2—for—3 on fulﬁlling his initial
goals.

He said that‘ each Board member that was
assigned as the liaison to his or her respec-
tive student groups sent out emails to their
assigned organizations when they requested
money at the Board’s Tuesday night meetings.
Additionally, he was able to hold three town
hall meetings since taking over as president
lastjanuary. Although he considers the project’s
implementation a success, he still believes there
is room to improve.

“I still think the town hall can have a place,”
Landreneau said, adding that “it needs to have
a draw for students” other than food or an ap-

pearance from Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-
dents Kathy Humphrey, who holds her own
open—forum meetings —— Dean’s Hours —— about
twice a month.

As for the on—campus leadership summit,
Landreneau initially discussed eliminating
Panther Gold, the off-campus retreat for stu-
dent group leaders that takes place each year
in late August. But instead of eliminating it,
he ended up revising the program by inviting
representatives from 15 to 20 more groups than
are usually invited, and 60 to 65 groups sent
representatives.

When it comes to the other members of the
Board, Landreneau thinks they did a “tremen-
dous job.”

“It’s pretty rare to have a Board with
1oo—percent success rate,” he said, referring
to his own and his Board members’ initiative
success. “Fm pretty happy with the results.” -

Olivia Armstrong

 

Olivia Armstrong set out at the beginning of
her term to utilize social media to gainfeedback
from students, allow student groups to request
for Allocations online and increase the usage of
the 30C shuttle bus in South Oakland.

She said that she used social media “a few
times” to get some feedbackfrom students, but
the responses were limited. SGB currently has
a Facebook page and Twitter account.

“[It] didn’t pan out as I was expecting,” Arm-
strong said. But she remains optimistic about
the future of SGB’s usage of social media.

This semester was the trial phase of online
Allocations requesting, and Armstrong said
she thinks this will continue on into future
semesters. Incoming Board member Michael
Nites plans to work on the online allocations
request system along with Gina Scozzaro, busi-
ness manager of the Student Organization Re-
source Center (SORC), who has been working
on developing the system.

Armstrong did not provide statistics on the
usage of the 30C.

 

Natalie Rothenberger

  

Natalie Rothenberger hoped to improve
textbook buyback, implement a security escort
system and increase the amount of available
advertising via the my.pitt portal.

Rothenberger worked with the administra-
tion to get 85 percent of professors to respond to
inquiries about if theywilluse the same bookin

the next semester, which gave The Book Center
abetter indication of which books to buy back.
She also worked to create an informational buy-
back video for students, to educate them on the
process and help them earn the most money for
their textbooks. A

She was also successful in implementing
more advertising through the my.pitt portal.
Certain students and campus events are now
advertised on the portal. Rothenberger’s work
with the portal also includes discussions to cre-
ate an RSS feed for the student events calendar

to make it more personal and convenient for —

those who wish to access it. Additionally, she
created a sheet that lists all of the options for
student advertising, which is given to student
groups on campus.

Establishingasecurity escort system turned
out to be less achievable than her other goals,
according to Rothenberger. She said that the

project would have cost “thousands upon thou— V

sands of dollars,” and that liability was a big
factor in the project’s failure.

“When one project goes wrong, you focus
your energy on another,” Rothenberger said,
adding that she continued to work with the
transportation and safety committee on other
issues.

Megan McGrath

 

I Megan McGrath wanted to create aweekend
shuttle to the Waterfront, increase advertising
for student groups on the my.pitt portal and at
outdoor venues and reinstate the Traditions
Committee.

She could not implement the weekend shut-
tle because of legal restrictions found within
the contract the University has with the Port
Authority. And while she could not get an out-
door advertising location because of difficul-
ties with a construction company, she worked
with Rothenberger on increasing advertising
through my.pitt.

McGrath said her most successﬁil initiative
was the revival of the Traditions Committee,
which is intended to implement traditions and
maintain them throughout University activities.
This year, the committee focused its energy on
the football team by rebranding the student
section at Heinz Field “the Panther Pitt” and
giving away T-shirts to season ticket purchasers
that inc1udedaPanther Pitt design on the front.

“In the future, I’d like to see that expand to
other sports,” McGrath said.

She said the committee took the idea of a
football watch party outside the Petersen Events
Center to the University, and then the admin-
istrators handled the planning. She said that a
similar event took place her sophomore year,
and after a one-year hiatus, she wanted it to
happen again.

“That was one thing students wanted to

bringbac ,” she said.

Julie Hallinan

 

Julie Hallinan initially hoped to improve the
career fair, establish meal plan rollovers after
the end of the semester and increase student
voter turnout inthe local and national elections.

Hallinan teamed up with the Governmental
Relations committee to increase studentvoting
and knowledge about the election process. She
helped to institute a change in voting location
for students residing in the Litchﬁeld Towers
and the Schenley Quadrangle from Posvar Hall
to the William Pitt Union and created an ir1for—
mational pamphlet outlining candidates run-
ning for national and local positions. Hallinan
said that the increased number of student voters
is a testament to SGB’s hard work, but did not
take all of the credit, as she cited campus—wide
efforts from various groups to register students
and support voting. 1

Meal—plan changes are currently in the
works and Hallinan said that she worked with
Jim Earle, Pitt’s director of Housing and Food
Services, and Sodexo to discuss the reshaping

of meal plan options and prices. Changes will .

include the combination of some of the dining
option tiers, more appropriate meal pricing and
the rollover of Dining Dollars from the fall to
spring semester. Currently, the Resident Student
Association has’ been taking surveys about the
changes to gather student feedback, Hallinan
said, but changes should be instituted for the
start of the 2013-2014 academic year.

Unlike her other two projects, Hallinan met
some unanticipated difﬁculties completing her
career fair initiative. She said that her intentions
to improve the career fair needed to be altered
because there was information regarding the
process that she wasn’t originally aware of.

Hallinan intended to refocus the “heavily
engineering-oriented” fairs to apply to non-
STEM majors, but found that organizations
must pay to attend and if they do not have jobs
to offer, money to travel or histories of hiring
Pitt students, they are less likelyto involve them-
selves. Hallinan worked with the Ofﬁce of Career
Development and Placement Assistance to dis-
cuss future networking opportunities to beneﬁt
liberalarts majors by bringing professionals in
to speak about their experiences. '

As the sole independent candidate elected
to the Board, Hallinan said that she was proud
of the projects that she accomplished and hopes
more people outside SGB are inspired to get
involved and take up projects.

“If you run into roadblocks, there is always
more work to be done, and it’s important not
to be astagnant Board member. I took up work
with Rainbow Alliance and the transgender

issue, the undergrad literature holders, and
don’t forget the Readership Program,” she said.
The undergraduate literature holders can

be found in places around campus —- including
in the William Pitt Union and the Cathedral of
Learning — and hold publications such as The

Pitt News and The Pitt Chronicle. The Reader-

ship Program, which offers all non-College of
General Studies undergraduates free access to

daily subscriptions ofThe New York Times and
USA today, canbe accessed through the locked

drop boxes around campus.

Zoe Samudzi

 

 

Zoe Samudzi aimed to create aforum for stu-
dent organizations to encourage the co-spon-
sorship of events, compile a resource manual
for students and implement an amnesty week
for reading and studying before ﬁnals.

Samudzi said she knew that her currently
infeasible amnesty week initiative would be
the most difﬁcult, but continued to work with
a number of administrators and faculty mem-
bers who she believes will be “open-minded in
the future.”

Before discussing the publication of a man-
ual with the Cross Cultural and Leadership De-
velopment ofﬁce, Samudzi said she was unaware
of the number of manuals already supplied to
freshmen duringtheir orientations. She initially
envisioned a manual outlining student resourc-
es on campus, including alternative ﬁmding and
the Allocations process, room and table reserva-
tions and other resources to help students take
on larger leadership roles and utilize campus
materials. But in pursuing her initiative, she
learned thata“rejuvenation” of current manuals
or the creation of new documents would create
costly strain on SGB funds.

According to Samudzi, a group of people are
now behind the effort to facilitate collabora-
tion, create the co-sponsorship of events and
inter-group support in approaching projects
and the administration. The project will pass
to the new Board.

“I’m interested to see how members of the
new Board take up the idea and implement it,”
she said. “It is never easy when someone says
[an initiative] is not going to work, but you have
to keep trying to rework it and make it more
attractive for them.”

Gordon Louderbackwill be the only returning
Board member next year.

Louderback ran for his 2012 seat on the
Board with promises to reconstruct the reser-
vation desk — the system for reserving rooms
inthe William Pitt Union, Cathedral of Learning
and David Lawrence Hall—for student organi-
zations, oifer greater wireless Internet service
in dorm rooms and implement more green
roofs on top of Pitt’s buildings. The projects
have reached varying degrees of completion.

A trial run for the reservation system oc-
curred in the summer, leading to the system
goingfully live in October. While the old system
saw a backlog as groups attempted to reserve
rooms — requiring a staff member to clear
each room for reservation and manually check
on room availabili , which often took several
days for previous in-use rooms to be deemed
available —— the new system is “streamlined,
lessening the communication gap between stu-
dent groups and the reservation desk” through
instantaneous reservations and technology,
catering and security forms in one place, Loud-
erback said.

Full wireless implementation in all of the
residence halls is in the planning stage and a
survey of the halls will be held during winter
break to determine feasibility, Louderback said.
Partial initiative completion is expected by the
end of the next semester, and full irnplementa—
tion is expected within the next few years.

“I can’t propose what kind of wires or prices
so [implementation] was more on [the admin-
istration’s] end to do all of the technical work.
Itwas my job to push the subject, be persistent
and keep expressing that this is what the stu-

dents want,” he said, adding that he met with
administration members at least monthly to
discuss project progress.

While the green roofs initiative was not com-
pleted, Louderback said that he still feels that he
metthe basic goals of the initiative by refocusing
it to create alarger impact throughapermanent
Green Fund Advisory Board (GFAB) — a sub-
committee of SGB’s Environmental Committee
dedicated to dispersingﬁmds solely for“green”
or sustainable projects thatwill no longer have
to be voted in yearly by the Board.

“I don’t consider that project an X mark,”
Louderback said. “I realized that it was more
worth my time to solidify GFAB to have a more
sustainable source of funding. By not focusing
on one [green roofs] initiative, I worked a little
harder to create the foundation for funding
10 or 20 green roofs projects, or the like, in
the future.”

Alex Murdoch

 

Alex Murdoch set out to change residence
hall access procedures to allow guests’ state IDs
to be used for swiping in, as well as working
to increase the number of businesses accept-
ing Panther Ftmds. He also hoped to facilitate

an agreement to allow club sports to use on-
campus facilities to practice. While progress has
been made on each project, each remains at a
phase moving toward ﬁiture completion dates.
The residence hall ID-swipe system was
updated this scholastic year to allow students
to swipe in other students using their Pitt IDs.
Murdoch hoped to expand swipe-in capabili-
ties to include state IDs for non-Pitt guests
-and, though he has not checked on the project
progress in some time, said the system should
be updated to accept state IDs for the start of
the new semester.
Murdoch took a “two—fold” approach to

724-742-BEEP 

his Panther Funds initiative and intended to
make the system quicker, more reliable and
more accessible to students. He said progress
was made on the ﬁrst part of the initiative and
Pitt will require allbusinesses offering Panther
Funds to update to high-speed Internet by Feb. 1.
Murdoch said he was unaware of Pitt’s market-
ing team, which works with businesses to offer
the funds, when he took on the initiative, so
expanding the program among already estab-
lished businesses was less successful. Expand-
ing, however, has come in the form of working
to get new businesses, such as the Popeye’s that
recently opened on Fifth Avenue, to include the
Panther Funds option.

Intramural and club sports teams do not
currently have access to permanent on-‘campus
competition spaces, but Murdoch said there

is a long—term plan to increase practice and
compeﬁtion space through the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs, including plans to renovate old build-
ings and possibly build new ones. To continue
the completion his initiative, Murdoch said
he took on a liaison role with the teams to aid
on smaller—scale projects such as organizing
practice times.

Additionally, Murdoch assumed former
Board member Ryan Gayman’s efforts to utilize
the office spaces in the O’Hara Student Center
and expanded it to include transforming the
building’s basement into a storage space for
student organizations. Murdoch said he feels
the Board accomplished, a great deal during
its term.

“Now it’s time to pass the torch and get some
new minds in here,” Murdoch said.

Halim Genus

 

Board member Halim Genus ran on the
initiatives of creating short-term community
service projects with student groups, getting
the Pitt shuttle stops marked andfcreating a
spring Pitt Make A Difference Day. ’ M ‘

Genus worked with SGB Transportation and
Safety Committee Chairman Richard White to
complete his shuttle stops initiative. Stops along
the Pitt 10A shuttle will be marked by the start
of the new year. The signs, whichwere designed
by White and will read “Pitt Shuttle Stop,” are
currently ordered.

Concrete plans have not been made to out-
line community service projects or to create
a system for students to take part in projects

- around Oakland. While the fall PMADD was

considered a success, a spring Pitt Make a Dif-
ference Day was not implemented.

In addition to his initiatives, Genus also
played a strong role in moving the polling lo-
cation for students living in Litchﬁeld Towers
and the Schenley Quadrangle from Posvar Hall
to the William Pitt Union, so that polling loca-
tions could be more easily accessed by students.

Genus did not return requests for comment.
The Future Board

Like the 2012 Board, the incoming members
willbe accountable for their efforts and project
completion. While the current Board met with
differing levels of success on members’ origi-
nal initiatives and many took on new projects
over the course of their terms, Louderback
said initiative completion rates can always be
improved.

To foster improvement, Louderback plans to
create project deadlines for his Board through-
out the term and require weekly updates during
the pre—public meeting planning sessions to en-
courage the collaboration and sharing of ideas.
He said minimal effort to complete projects will
not be tolerated under his guidance.

“The Board was elected to these positions,
and it would be a shame if they waste this op-
portunity and the role that they were granted
by students. I don’t want to ‘see that happen,”
he said.

Louderback said he intends to make sure the
2013 Board has access to everything necessary
to complete its projects and is always available
for assistance. I

As_2012 winds down, two writers reflect: How did Pitt fare?

Nick Stamatakis and
Rosie McKinley
Columnists

Given all that has happened at Pitt,
what will be the lasting legacy of
2012‘? What are the highlights and
lowlights?

Rosie McKinley: Pitt celebrat-
ed its 225th year in 2012. Yet aside
from a few banners hung around
campus ambiguously saying, “225
Years of Building Better Lives,” the
University did not take much time
from the present to celebrate the
past. In typical Pitt fashion, the
anniversary was understated; the
Alumni Association probably used
the occasion as a fundraising oppor-
tunity, but otherwise, most students
were more concerned with 2012
than they were 1787.

And rightly so. For what a year
it has been.

A new residence hall went up.
We were once again ranked as one
of the top universities in the world.
And the common struggle brought
on by the bomb threats fostered a
stronger sense of community.

Nick Stamatakis: Rose-colored
glasses, Rosie. With the bomb-
threat situation, it was nice that
we all came together, but shouldn’t
that just have been expected? I
think every traumatic event by na-
ture brings people together. I don’t
«know if there was anything super
“Pitt” about it. Far more alarming
was the administration’s response:
TSA-style bag inspections that im-
mediately became ignored and
half enforced. It was unsettling to
see them try the everything-but-
the-kitchen-sink approach when
nothing, including the kitchen sink,
would have worked in that situa-
tion.

And yes, the rankings are great.

But does it actually matter? For
every list put out by Quacquarelli
Symonds, there are probably seven
other lists on which Pitt doesn’t ﬁnd
itself ranked very high.

If you want to talk lists, we
haven’t budged in the U.S. News
and World.Report list. I’d argue
that is the one with the most au-
thority. Except, of course, the AP
Sports Writers P011 or the BCS Poll.
I don’t need to tell you how we did
on those lists.

So I’m going to be the grump and

give this year, on the institutional
level, a mild “meh.” e

RM: OK, so we didn’t move up
on US News and World Report, and
didn’t make it anywhere at all in
terms of the BCS or AP polls, but
neither of those make any sort of
statement, about the high quality
of daily Pitt life and general happi-
ness in 2012.

Sure, our two most popular Di-
vision I sports — men’s basketball
and football — were a disappoint-
ment at a school with rich traditions
in both. But those disappointments
were greatly mitigated by the im-
pressive 2012 seasons for many of
our club sports, poignantly marked
by the men’s club Ultimate Frisbee
National Championship.

And no list can account for
some of the intangibly great days
this year. I mean, certainly US News
and World Report can’t calculate St.
Patrick’s Day 2012 when ranking
Pitt. But you’d be hard pressed to
ﬁnd a better day at any University
anywhere in the nation. The unusu-
ally warm March Saturday will go
down in South Oakland history; I’m
pretty sure Mellinger’s ran out of
Natty kegs.

But back to those bomb threats.

Yeah, I hated them as much as the ‘

next Pitt student, but they were the

rare event that makes our time here
memorable. Don’t discountthe way
Pitt students ignored theTSA-like
security measures (like not bring-
ing your backpack into a campus
building). Our deﬁant attitude to-
ward rules we found ridiculous and
ineffective is just one indication of
how reasonably and calmly we, as
a student body, handled the situa-
tion. To loosely quote Van.Wilder, if
we had taken life during the bomb

threats too seriously, we’d maybe _

never have gotten out alive.

Plus, after last spring, how great
did having classes uninterrupted by
bomb threats seem this semester?

I I’d say better than ever. ' _

NS: Men’s Club Ultimate? This
somehow compensates for the
miserable seasons elsewhere?]ust
think about the converse scenario
— Pitt men’s basketball and foot-
ball sailed to new heights, but men’s
club Ultimate failed. I don’t think
you’d ﬁnd too many complaining.

And I’m not saying the year was
bad —— St. Patrick’s day did have
an Arizona—State, mythical qual-
ity to it, and student resistance to
security measures was inspiring —
but I’m just saying there were fewer
ﬁreworks. No Snowpocalpyse or
victory riots or real riots. 225 was a
dud. The Port Authority is in crisis.
The economy still suffers. Long-
term state funding is uncertain,
seemingly contingent entirely on
the health of the natural gas indus-
try, delaying inevitable decisions
that will need to be made at Pitt and
at the state. V -

RM: OK, so we didn’t have any
Tony Dorsetts to celebrate or freak
natural disasters to cancel classes
this year (oddly enough, the liquor
store closed for Hurricane Sandy,
but the University didn’t —— that
sure had me questioning where our

priorities lie). And certainly the
larger economic context of our time
at Pitt is a concerning one; it’s easy
to imagine that my children won’t
be able to afford my alma mater.
But for now, the cuts have stopped.

Indeed, the bomb-threat disas-
ter greatly overshadowed every-
thing else, such as the completion
of a $2 billion fundraising campaign
or the construction of Nordenberg
Hall. But in surviving them in a

uniquely calm manner, by coming
back this semester despite all the
disappointments of the spring, 2012
illustrates that amidst the stresses
of mid—terms, paying rent or miss-
ing March Madness, we did carry
on. ”

And in doing so, we actively con-
tributed to Pitt’s 225-year1egacy.l

Spotted: calculus student crying while
studying for ﬁnals

Heard: “Gen ed. grades don’t matter.”

Felt: The pain of students laboring
to inﬂate an artiﬁcial, unrepresentative
heuristic of performance

Grades are ostensibly an attempt to
gauge how much we have mastered the
material presented in a course. Evalua-
tion in the classroom should accomplish
something useful for learning, but letter
grades don’t do that. Instead, they cre-
ate a classroom environment ﬁlled with
anxiety and competition. Because grades
typecast students and emphasize quanti-
ﬁcation over improvement, grades have
become obsolete.

In exchange for these incomplete mea-
sures of our completeness, we sacrifice
emotional, physical and, most critically,
intellectual well-being.

Just consider how we talk about class-
es. How many times have you heard a
student ask “Will this be on the test?” or
“How much is this assignment worth?” Do
we evaluate our effectiveness as learners,
or do we reduce ourselves to ﬁnding the
best ways to exploit the grading system?

This grade-based insanity does more
than just distort the student—teacher rela-
tionship. We also become less compelled
to take challenging courses, which pre-
vents us from testing our limits. This,
coupled with the superficial sort of
learning encouraged by grades, greatly
undercuts the ability of curious or mo-
tivated students to gain true intellectual
attainment.

Grades also harm by not helping. They

merely label students as successes or fail-
ures. This is all a letter grade achieves: It
subjects students to an external motiva-
tion (i.e., bribery) as a means ofimprov—
ing performance, but if students do not
respond, they risk being labeled a failure.
All of our complicated learning patterns
are reduced to a simplistic, one-character
grade.

Ifwe want to evaluate students, it must
be with growth-based tools. Rather than
being told that we are good or bad at
something (receiving an A or an F), we
need to be told what we have done well
and on what we can improve. This has
to be speciﬁc to be meaningful: Being
good at math isn’t a meaningful concept
but being good at applied problems is.
Earning a B in Introduction to Ethics is
almost comically simplistic.

The solution to ending this intellec-
tual stagnation and emotional turmoil
is narrative evaluations. Rather than as-
signing letter grades, instructors should
give written evaluations of the strengths
and weaknesses of each student, paired
with a satisfactory or no credit “grade”
to indicate if students need to relearn the
material or if they can move on.

With narrative evaluations, students
would not compete against each other
because there is nothing to compete for.
Rather than being stiﬂed by fear, we could
give justice to our passions. Evaluations
could become a tool for the type of in-
trospection that accelerates our learning
about learning. In the quest for fulﬁll-
ment, evaluations — ever the indicator of
whether we succeed or fail during ﬁnals
week — could instead be welcomed as

Hide yo’ kids, hide yo’ wife, but actually just lock the windows

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

Leaving South Oakland during the holi-
days is always a gamble. Students, desper-

ate for a break from grungy off-campus

living, turn to their parents’ homes for
safer venues but leave their possessions

(in South Oakland — a place soon to be-

come a black hole where many valuable
items disappear.

 Gone without a trace, these in—home
items_arei,‘t;yp_ical1y small and compact,
but can alsolbe larger. Regardless, stu-

dents return from break to the discom— .

broken into, to their belongings scattered

and to the uneasy feeling that, even in V

your own home, you’re not..,safe.

My roommates and I left for Thanks-
giving break this year, unconcerned about
such rob,b.erie_s. I’vellive'_d in the same
house for two years, an I.naively‘e"x3

moved in — not now, as a senior, when
I have grown comfortable in the South
Oakland home I’ve lived in for the major-
ity of my undergraduate career.

When we re—entered our house after
the long weekend away, we quickly real-
ized someone else had been there. My
roommate had a significant amount sto-

wallets had been opened and searched

But not all robberies endyso humorous-

Studentsinlineed of a home who invest

in South Oakland might see their choice
as a good idea, but after the amount of
difficulty residents face with the vari-
ous incidents from holiday robberies to
drunken damage, that investment might
be less ofa blessing and more ofa curse.

In 2010, there were 46 burglaries on
campus and in the surrounding Oakland

renters’ emotional
well—being.

Still, hoards of
Pitt students exit
dorm life for the
freedom of living
off campus. They
look for listings
months ahead of
time, choose room-
mates in advance,
and, once they ﬁnd
a decent house off campus, theyjump at
the inexpensive rent and location in the
middle of the college scene.

Students rarely stop to think of the
protective benefits on—campus living of-
fers. After freshman year’s brief taste of
independence, students want to cut the
cord even more.

For those contemplating living off
campus, consider this: It might be a nice
thought to live without an RA or without
having to swipe into your dorm, but you

GREAT

will have to accept the very real possibil-
ity that someone could break into your
home while you’re gone for break. And
even worse, the break—in and theft might
go unsolved.

Students shouldn’t be afraid to move
off campus, but they should be wary of
the differences it will bring. Officer Ron
Bennett of the Pitt police cautioned stu-
dents who live off campus but go home
for the holidays. P

“Our advice to students is to secure
all their valuables before leaving. They
should make sure all windows and doors
are secured, not only during the holidays,
but at all times,” he said in a 2011 inter-
view with The Pitt News. “We also encour-
age them to report any suspicious activity
to our department at 412-624-2121, or, if
they’re not on University property, 911
for the city of Pittsburgh PD.”

If my roommates and I had met these
standards, we might not be in the unfor-
tunate circumstance we’re in now. (My
roommate, who had items stolen from
her, later learned that her window has
been unlocked, the means through which
the robbers entered.)

And the only way to do this is simple:
Lock your doors and windows, and take
your dearest possessions home. '

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

Thank you for bringing attention to the World AIDS Day Rally and events on
campus. However, The Pitt News’ superficial and even inaccurate coverage of these
events (“World AIDS Day,” 12/3) was a disservice to the students involved.

The article dismissed the roles of students and volunteers in this event. Contrary
to statements in the article, the principal organizer of the rally was Tran Doan, a
vice president of Pitt’s Graduate and Professional Student Government. Ms. Doan
and GPSG, along withjason Herring from (Pittsburgh) Red, coordinated the major-
ity of student participation and logistics. This omission also discounts many other
student leaders and volunteers who were essential to this event.

The article also neglected to mention any ancillary World AIDS Day student events.
Pitt students deserve much credit for their efforts: T-shirt sales and tabling, an HIV
Trivia Night, the SGB Pre—rally, documentary screenings, a remembrance service
and many more. The'article’s disregard of the student activities surrounding the
rally paints a poor picture of Pitt students’ concern about sexual health and their
commitment to educating their communities about HIV.

Fifteen to 24-year-olds account for 40 percent of all new (non—infant) HIV cases;
infections in the Pittsburgh region are on the rise. World Aids Day offers opportu-
nities to engage in advocacy and dispel stigma and discrimination. Yet your article
perpetuated myths by treating HIV and AIDS as synonymous. Understanding the
differences between this virus (HIV) and the advanced immune-compromised stage
of the disease (AIDS) is crucial toprevention and care efforts.

tools for self—enrichment. A

The easiest, and largest, criticism of
this method is that without grades as a
motivator, no one will go to class or do
assignments. Yet according to work by
Sylvia Bagley, a professor at Mount St.
Mary’s College, students can be moti-
vated by these softer evaluation tools.
Studying high school students, she ﬁnds
narrative tools can be more motivating
than standard grades.

Another fear students have is that
employers and graduate schools won’t
take them seriously without grades. If
Pitt stopped offering letters, students

wouldn’t enroll, believing employers
might not be willing to hire students
without GPAs to demonstrate their ex-
cellence in school.

students aren’t

60 percent of each

tistic is about 35

should give

to mandatory letter
grades.

Yet narrative evaluation remains in ‘

demonstrating
that a traditional
transcript isn’t a requirement. Addition-
ally, according to Andy Guess of inside-

highered.com, law schools as prestigious
as Yale are dropping their grade-based
policies to promote intellectual curiosity.

This trend is promising, and it indi-
cates that we might move beyond our
current GPA system. Though it is unrea -
istic to advocate Pitt leading any change,
given the short-sighted societal demand
for GPAs, a soft switch to requiring nar-
rative evaluations would provide many
of the benefits of such a system without
the drawbacks. Eventually, we could see
real progress toward a far more open
and inspiring intellectual landscape, one
which ends the tragedy of finals week
and all the stress, strain and slog for the
letters that come with it.I

Although ﬁnals week comes in many shapes
and sizes for students, all can agree on the
universal stresses: We’re tired, wired on
coffee and ready to go home. This stress
demands relief, lest it builds up into a tightly
packed ball of animosity daring to be released
on our fellow Club Hillman study partners.

But fear not: With the help of some stra-
tegically placed gaming sessions, you can
alleviate stress. Here is a list of three video
games you should play during ﬁnals week.
All three of these games have a few things

‘in’ common. They’re relatively cheap, so you

can justify purchasing them during a study-
induced panic attack. They are all easy to
learn to play, so don’t fear a learning curve.
And they’re fun to play for short periods of
time, so they’re perfect for study breaks.

It’s ﬁ1_ﬁ;“It’s‘goofy.vIt’sIincredibly deep.
“Team. Fortress 2” brings the complex-
ity and teamwork of a class-based shooter,

akin to “Battleﬁeld 3” or “PlanetSide 2,” and,
combines it with the witty sense of humor

That Valve, its developer, brings to games
such as “Portal 2.”

“TF2” is a game anyone can jump in and
play instantly. Its quirky sense of style has a
wide appeal, and so does its price: This game
is also entirely free to play. These style and

price aspects make the gamefreadily acces-
sible to newcomers to bothiithe genre and
video games as a whole.

“Killing Floor”
Let’s face it: Zombies will kill us all one
day, so it’s best to be prepared to go down in

en ab1aze'ofglory.. “Killing Floor” teaches you

to do just that. ‘

Set in a near-future London that has been
overrun with a lab experiment gone wrong,
“Killing Floor’’ pulls four players together
to ﬁght against waves of specimens. Before
each wave, players are given a brief period

“Killing Floor” lets studentsfizut off studying in favor of_zombie—killing action. MCT Campus

to weld doors shut, purchase weapons and
otherwise prepare for the onslaught. Once
this period ends, the raucous Violence begins.
And it continues, wave after wave, until all
the players die, or, far less likely, the players
defeat every wave and the level boss.
Along with the frenetic gameplay, the

price point is on the mark for ﬁnalsweek: I

This game brings you the zombie fun for
which “Call of Duty: Black Ops II” is cele-
brated for less than half the price.

Holiday shopping made  Follow staff advice to give good 

'7'“ The Pitt News Staff

With the holidays quickly approaching,
busy students tend to put off gift shopping
to study. This dreaded task piles up, leav-
ing students scrambling to come up with
,ghoughtful gifts for their friends and family.
M For those waiting until the last minute
to do any holiday shopping, here are some
quick and easy options that procrastinating
students can put together as soon as their
last ﬁnal is over.

By Rebecca Burns

Tearing through wrapping paper to ﬁnd
a nicely knit scarf with all of your favorite
colors, a scrapbook ﬁlled with memories or
a fabric-covered notebook acknowledging
someone’s love for journaling are all ways to

nnake a gift signiﬁcantly more sentimental.

I believe in giving gifts that have meaning
and last forever — or at least for a while.
Homemade gifts may seem frugal to some,
but I think that receiving a homemade gift
from a friend represents a lot. Although
homemade gifts are not always less expen-
sive, they can be a better option for those
of us living on a stringent budget.

We can ﬁnd ways to use the resources
we have on a strict budget while showing
the gift receiver that we put sincere thought
and work into the gift. The best feeling that

comes with opening a present is recogniz-
ing that someone listened and remembered
what you wanted.

Gift giving should not be as competition of
who bought the most expensive gift. Instead,
it is about ﬁnding something that will show
the ones you love what they mean to you.

By Brett Murphy

What most people want as a gift for the
holidays (or their birthdays, or just in gen-
eral, really) is money. It’s the transnational
language. But for some ungodly reason, the
mere exchange of cash as a present has been
labeled taboo among close friends and im-
mediate family. So unless you’re celebrating
your bar mitzvah, don’t expect to get a pile
of money.

College kids, probably more than most

demographics, know all—too-well this in-_

herent desire, this unﬂinching attachment
to the dollar bill. So for the holidays — I
come from a Christmas and Hanukkah fam-
ily (jealous?) — I always get people the next
best thing: gift cards.

It’s quick and easy. Five minutes in a con-
venience store, where they have those rotat-
ing racks of gift cards for all different stores,
and you can knock out the stocking stuffers
for pretty much everyone you know. I usu-
ally don’t cheap out and like to give an equal
$20 to all the lucky recipients. Starbucks,

Panera, Dunkin’ Donuts, Amazon, Five Guys,
Supercuts, IGA, Dave and Buster’s —~ you
can give them the entire shopping gamut.

You’re giving them money but without
the materialistic stigma.

What is the hardest concert ticket to get
almost every year on New Year’s Eve? A Phish
ticket for their traditional year—end show
at Madison Square Garden. This is the one
show every year that Phish phans dream
of going to. Every Phish boy or girl, big or
small, dreams of hearing Trey Anastasio’s
Languedoc guitar scream the notes of Auld
Lang Syne at midnight ﬁrst-hand.

Unfortunately, the show is known for
selling out in minutes on Ticketmaster,
which results in many angry phans. This
is why I think a New Year’s‘ Eve Phish ticket
would be my favorite gift to give — provided,
of course, that I ever get ahold of one.

Whether the recipient of my gift had been
to every show of the summer tour that year
or had spent their summer nights on Live-
phish.com refreshing the page every ten
minutes to see what songs the band was
playing, the look of joy on their face would
be priceless. I would realize, however, that
this look of joy would by no means capture
the person’s internal ecstasy that comes

The holidays are a time of embracing the
cliche —- whether through tacky holiday
sweaters or grand acts of love. So, I will say
with full awareness of being cliche: The best
gift is music. A ’ '

Nowadays, when music most often comes
in intangible form, the easiest way to gift it
is with an iTunes gift card. But, what ever
happened to CDs? I remember the days when
you unwrapped a perfectly square, perfectly
ﬂat package and all on one disc was a collec-
tion of songs, not just one or two. By the end
of the season, you could name your favorite
track — because you had heard all of them
as they were meant to be heard, in the order
presented. _

Even for the trickiest of people, music can
be personal. If your dad likes Neil Young, ta-

Five albums make WPTS top list, wrapping up 202music

£5.

John Teoli
WPTS Comfrzbutor

Whether or not you have heard of all of these
albums — or any — we feel that they are the
best and most important of 2012, making
waves in the music community and becom-
4ng—acclaimed by critics and WPTS alike.

1. Lonerism by Tame Impala

Tame Impala’s music is rich with reso-
nance and reverberation, idiosyncratic of
psychedelic music. The band does psych
rock so well that it could be mistaken for
one of the late 1960s groups from which it
draws inspiration.

Lonerism does not reinvent the sound
from its ﬁrst album but redrafts it into a
massive and sprawling experience. The cen-
terpiece of the music alternates between the
lyrics and the guitars, which speak just as
well for themselves. The drums flow within
the music and also set the groove of the
songs. Although the instruments serve spe-
ciﬁc purposes, they are free to explore their
own dynamics.

This album’s brilliance stems from its
striking sense of dichotomy. There is a com-
bination of huge rock orchestrations and
minute details. Its retro aesthetics of psy-
chedelic rock don’t prevent a sense of mod-
ern songwriting. The lyrics look inward, but

the music has an outward momentum with
the ability to ﬁll any environment.

Lonerism is sure to please everyone from
the harshest critics to those with only a
passing interest in rock ‘n’ roll.

2. Until the Quiet Comes by Flying Lotus

In the past few years, Los g.ngeles—based
producer Flying Lotus has grown from the
cult champion behind the famous title
screens of “Adult Swim” to a beat-making
wunderkind who collaborates with everyone
from soul legend Erykah Badu to Radiohead
mastermind Thom Yorke.

Until the Quiet Comes is a personal trip
through the astral planes of the LA nightlife,
incorporating ambient qualities into richly
textured and inﬁnitely engaging sonic land-
scapes. Flying Lotus has once again struck
gold by injecting jazz inﬂuences into the
heart of his hip-hop beats.

3. good kid, m.A.A.d. city by Kendrick
Lamar

WPTS ranked good kid, m.A.A.d city as
the top hip-hop album of the year. It is one
of those rare albums that effortlessly mixes
poetic lyricism with mainstream appeal in
a way that is sure to please hip —hop experts
and dance ﬂoor frequenters. Lamar, who is
new to the scene, employs a style that ranges
from thoughtful storytelling to avmore ra-

dio —friendly raw energy that could easily be
played at the most basic party scene.

His style and prose has quickly devel-
oped a dedicated fan base that is sure to
expand further after Lamar’s future collabo-
rations with the likes of Kid Cudi and Lady
Gaga. This album can seamlessly transition
from carefully constructed stories about the
young star’s upbringing to more visceral
tracks that play off mainstream, hip-hop
bravado, such as women, cars, narcotics
and money.

With good kid, m.A.A.d. city seeing over
200,000 record sales in its ﬁrst week, La-
mar is steadily making his way up the lad-
der through talent, quality releases and a
strong following.

4. Nootropics by Lower Dens

Nootropics is a concept album that ex-
plores how technology interacts with our
daily lives without a decisive message that
reﬂects the band’s collective thoughts.
Lower Dens is not pragmatic enough to
completely denounce technology. Instead,
the band oifers an honest reﬂection as to
how it can help us but also, as to how it can
dilute pure human experiences by altering
day-to-day interactions and the ways we
live and work.

Tame Impala’s album Lonerism made the
No.1 spot on WPTS’ year-end list.

ﬁe much, so much, so muc .” So much for
lyrical content. _
“They say all I rap about it is b*tches and
champagne / you would too if every night you
seen the same thing,” Wiz sings on the track

“When I’m Gone,” which also appeared on his '

t album, RollingPapers. This cocky attitude

IS nothing new, but the real questionis whether

a working—class city like Pittsburgh can still
relate to what its biggest rapper is preaching.

While WIZ has always been a “plane” -— as

he refers to ihimselfin “This Plane,“ a track off .
Deal or No Deal (also cleverly referring to his A

illicit drug use) —- to elevate the status of those
around him, ﬁrst class is not for all of us. The
Allderdice High School graduate now lives in a
mansion located in Canonsburg, Pa., southwest
of Pittsburgh and far ﬁom reality.

For those who appreciate Wiz’s rise to fame

ggatherthan envy it, 0.N.I.F.C. provides the usual
array ofbass—heavy club tracks that helped pro-
pel him to stardom. One of the album’s three
singles, “Work Hard, Play Hard,” which has
already been downloaded nearly a million times
since its release in late August, reﬂects the blue-
collar Pittsburgh scene in which Wiz spent his
childhood.

managed to come up with creative, witty lines,
proving that while he may focus his music on
partying and wealth, he can still write lines that
challenge the listener.

Being one of the few human beings left
who prefers to write by hand than to type,
this holiday season I’d like to avoid the fancy
Stevejobs gadgets and give something that
harkens back to our ancestral roots of writ-
ing things down ever so primitively.

Moleskine notebooks have the allure of
making you look cool while you take notes,
and in the event that the world does end this

gins to be played at all hours of the day, I start
to get stressed about what gifts to buy for
my friends and family. It can be hard to ﬁnd
the perfect present for everyone, especially
as a broke college student.

But I’ve found that with just a little cre-
ativity and thought, it isn’t too difficult to
ﬁnd gifts for everyone on your list. My per-
sonal favorite gift to give during the Christ-
mas season is a homemade gift card. They
are redeemable for things like a lunch date,
tickets to a movie, etc.

This is especially appropriate for your
signiﬁcant other, if you aren’t sure what is
appropriate to buy for him or her at this
point. You can also never go wrong with
jewelry — for both guys and girls. Watches,
earrings, rings — everyone loves some new
bling.

The album’s result is equally as complex
as the issue itself, juxtaposing the precision
of layered synthesizers and effect pedals with
the organic beauty of the human voice. The
album is likened to krautrock — a genre that
makes use of consistent tight—knit grooves.

Although the songs revolve around some
central tenets, they are all very different.
Ultimately, the music on the album is just as
breathtaking as the issues behind it, mak-
ing Nootropics increasingly rewarding with
each listen.

5. Shields by Grizzly Bear

Over the years, Grizzly Bear’s albums
have become less stylistic and more acces-
sible. But this trade-off has never meant a de-
cline in quality. Coming off the breakthrough
success of Veckatimest, the band’s 2009
album, Shields ﬁnds Grizzly Bear moving
into more rock—driven territory while retain-
ing most of the band’s psych-folk elements
in the underlying ambience.

Grizzly Bear has always been celebrated
for the graceful power emanating from the
atmospheric qualities of its music. While
not entirely a blues album, Shields plays off
the type of isolation and despair that is typi-
ﬁed by the genre. Underneath the aesthetic
beauty of the music, these feelings resonate
in a demandingly prominent way. I

For fellow Pittsburgh—dwellers or your loved

precipitation, the bubble umbrella is a per-
fect gift.

I may be biased because I have thick,
curly hair that explodes upon exposure to
the smallest amount of humidity, but I ﬁnd
the bubble umbrella to be nothing short of
revolutionary. These umbrellas, for sale at
Target for $17 or $20 depending on your

Freshman guard Rob’

.Sta_]j" Writer

Pitt men’s basketball freshman
point guard James Robinson is a
winner;

In his four-seasons at DeMatha -

Catholic High School in Hyatts-
ville, Md., Robinson won more
games —— 120 —-— than any player
in the school’s history and lost only
one home game. Over the summer
between his senior season at De-
Matha and freshman year at Pitt,
Robinson played on the USA Bas-

fkhtball Men’s U18 team — coached
by Florida’s Billy Donovan, Gon-
zaga’s Mark Few and Virginia Com-
monwealth’s Shaka Smart — that
won the gold medal at the FIBA

Brazil.

ESPN in an interview after the
tournament. “But once we started
practicing, we saw that he’s a win-
ger and a great role guy. He’s a typi-

love coaching him. I’m not sure of
his impact on the team, but people
will say, ‘Where did this guy come

season. Robinson’s numbers are.
not spectacular: He is averaging
7.4 points and 4.2 assists as the
starting guard alongside senior
Tray Woodall. But for Dixon, it
goes beyond those numbers.

In coach Dixon’s decade as the
leader of Pitt basketball, not many
freshmen have started for the Pan-
thers, but Robinson is validating
his coach’s decision with one of
the nation’s“best assist-to-turnover
ratios at 5.25.

And Dixon and Pitt fans have
already witnessed Robinson’s win-
ning demeanor on display Nov.

Golden Grizzlies by as much as

Pitt offense shines in dominant victory over North Florida

.3, RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

After struggling at times offen-
sively in its City Game victory over
Duquesne on Wednesday, the Pitt
men’s basketball team had no such
ﬁfoblems Saturday night at the Pe-
tersen Events Center.

The Panthers (9-1) used several
offensive spurts to blow out North
Florida (3-6) and improve their
winning streak to ﬁve games with
Qpdominant 89-47 victory over the
Ospreys.

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
was pleased with his team’s per-
formance, especially pn offense.

“You can’t be more efﬁcient
than what we were offensively,”
ﬁoach Dixon said after the game,
citing the Panthers’ 21 assists and
ﬁve turnovers.

North Florida head coach Mat-

thew Driscoll, a Pittsburgh native
who attended Northgate High
School, was also impressed with
Pitt’s passing.

“They share the sugar so well,”
Coach Driscoll said of the Panthers.
“The thing that they do well is that
they probably could take a whole
lot more shots, especially when
they get in close, but they’re always
looking to pass the ball.”

Driscoll also stated that he be-
lieves the Panthers are the best
team his Ospreys have played this
season. North Florida has already
lost to No. 14 Minnesota, Mem-
phis, Florida State and Kansas
State. ‘

Early on, it appeared the Pan-
thers would fulﬁll pre—game ex-
pectations and cruise to an easy
victory against the Ospreys.

Following two misses to begin
the game, Pitt converted on its

next ﬁve shots to take a 17-10 lead.
The Panthers led by as many as
11 points in the contest’s opening
minutes, but North Florida battled
back to tie the game at 27.

Pitt showed its resilience, as
the Panthers responded to the Os-
preys’ comeback with a run of their
own, scoring the next 12 points and
taking a 41-30 lead into the break.

The Panthers weren’t exactly
pleased with their play in the ﬁrst
half.

“We were a little bit disappoint-
ed [in our ﬁrst-half performance] ,”
senior forward Dante Taylor said.
“We knew we had to pick it up.”

Pitt redshirt sophomore for-
ward Cameron Wright echoed
Taylor’s statement, saying that the
Panthers need to start playing a full
40 minutes.

“We could start the game bet-
ter,” Wright said. “We can deﬁnite-

ly pick it up, and we will.”

Momentum immediately car-
ried to the second half when Pitt
freshman center Steven Adams
emphatically slammed home an
alley-oop pass from senior point
guard Tray Woodall to score the
ﬁrst points of the period.

The dunk sparked a complete
domination of the second half by
Pitt. Led by Woodall and redshirt
junior Lamar Patterson on offense
and Adams on defense, the Pan-
thers wore down the Ospreys and
outscored the school from the At-
lantic Sun Conference 48-17 in the
second half.

Woodall ﬁnished with 14 points
and nine assists, while Patterson
tallied 13 points, two rebounds
and two assists. Redshirt junior
forward Talib Zanna and redshirt
sophomore guard Cameron Wright
also impressed offensively, scoring

15 and 10 points, respectively.

But it was Taylor who led the
Panthers in scoring with 16 points,
and Coach Dixon praised his senior
forward’s efforts.

“He does all the right things,”
Dixon said of Taylor, highlighting
his work ethic in practice. “He’s a
great, kid and a great teammate.”

The night saw an interesting
statistical anomaly: North Florida
failed to shoot a single free throw.
It was the ﬁrst time in school his-
tory that Pitt has prevented an op-
ponent from making even a single
trip to the free-throw line.

“I didn’t even know that was

possible,” Taylor said when asked 5

about the stat. '

The Panthers now have a week
off before they host Bethune Cook-
man University at the Petersen
Events Center next Friday, Dec.

Panthers pounce on Maryland to earn another quality win

Dustin Gabler
Senior Suﬁ Wrz'l'er

Once again, the No. 16 Pitt wrestling team(2-
2) fell behind early, but the comeback began
sooner than it did last week as the Panthers
stormed back to take ﬁve of the last six matches
Friday night against No. 17 Maryland at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

The biggest turning point in Pitt’s 23-12
victory overthe Terrapins came at the 165- and
174—pound weight classes when No. 11 Tyler
Wilps and Nick Bonaccorsi earned a technical
fall and a pin, respectively.

Wilps, Pitt’s 165—pounder, racked up 10 take-
downs and ﬁnished his 27-8 technical fall with
three near—fall points. Before his match, the
Panthers trailed 9-6, but after being awarded
the ﬁve team points for the technical fall, Pitt

‘ jumped out to a lead that it wouldn’t give back.

Continuing to build on the lead that Wilps
earned, Bonaccorsi pinned his opponent, Aar-
on Norris, at 3:58. Bonaccorsiwas nearapin as
the ﬁrst period ended, but he couldn’t beat the
buzzer. He didn’t miss out on the second chance
at his ﬁrst career dual—match pin though.

But as successful as Pitt’s higher weight
classes were, the lower ones struggled yet
again.

Freshman 125—pounder Godwin Nyama
wrestled a close match against the 12th-ranked

Shane Gentry. Within the last minute, Nyama
got a takedown and was close to getting some
near—fall points. Despite an improved third-
period performance, the freshman fell 5-3 to
Gentry. 4 .

One of the night’s three battles between
ranked wrestlers‘ came at 133 pounds. Pitt’s
N 0. 7 Shelton Mack lost 3-2 to Maryland’s No.
13 Geoff Alexander. Tied at 2-2 as time expired,
Alexander picked up the win with his 1:02 of
riding time, putting the Panthers in an early
6-0 hole.

Travis Shaffer came out strong for the
Panthers at 141 pounds to get a 7-0 win over
Maryland’s Danny O’Malley. Shaffer domi-
nated the match with two takedowns and two
back points. He also forced the referee to call
O’Malley for stalling twice.

At 149 pounds, Lou Mascola of Maryland
defeated the Panthers’ Donnie Tasser with a
takedown and a crucial reversal in the third
period. Mascola’s reversal pushed the score
to its ﬁnal tally, 4-2.

Then the comeback began for Pitt. Troy
Reaghard got it started with a 4-2 victory over
Ma1yland’s Danny Orem at 157 pounds.

After Reaghard brought the deﬁcit to only
three, Wilps and Bonaccorsi combined for 11
points in their two victories, giving the Pan-
thers a17-9 lead with three of Pitt’s ﬁve ranked

Duquesne’s 3-point shooting

too much for Panthers

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato remains tied for the school’s all-time wins record after her
Panthers lost to Duquesne in the wumen’s City Game. Sarah Kontos I Senior Staff Photographer

A spirited effort by Pitt sophomore point
guard Brianna Kiesel was not enough for
the Panthers to earn their seventh win of
the season, as the women’s basketball team
fell to the Duquesne Dukes 70-61 Saturday
afternoon.

The annual women’s City Game was
hosted by Duquesne at the A._]. Palumbo
Center, and the contest was Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato’s ﬁrst chance to become the
all-time winningest coach in Pitt women’s
basketball history.

A failure to break the Dukes’ ﬁill-court
press resulted in 11 costly ﬁrst-half turn-
overs for Pitt. The Dukes (8-1) capitalized
with 19 points off 20 Pitt turnovers in the
game. I i I ’

Five ﬁrst-half 3-pointers for Duquesne
allowed the hosts to build a 35-32 advantage
atthe break. Since being punished by pre-
vious opponents from beyond the arc, the
Panthers have been focusing on closing out
on shooters, but the Dukes still found a way
to cash in, hitting 9-of-20 3-point attempts.

With about ﬁve minutes remaining in
the second half and Pitt still hopeful of a
comeback, Kiesel landed hard on her left
knee after going up for a rebound. Medical
staff assisted her off thevﬂoor, but she re-
turned to the game two minutes later after
receiving treatment.

“Everyone in the gym got scared when
Bri went down,” Berenato said after the
game. “I was just as scared when Asia [Lo-
gan] went down with her shoulder. It was
just a really -physical game overall.”

With Kiesel back in, the Panthers kept

scoring in an attempt to rally for the victory.
But every time Pitt would convert a bucket,
the Dukes responded with a momentum-
killing 3—pointer. ..  . . ..

' Belma Nurkic, a Pittsburgh native, led
Duquesne with 18 points, shooting 5-for-8
from 3-point range. She was one of four
Duquesne players in double ﬁgures. I

Coach Berenato said the Dukes’ precise
shooting from long range made the differ-
ence in the tight—rivalry game.

“We knew that their perimeter game
was really good,” Berenato said. “We had
our heels on the 3-point line, but they shot
with a lot of conﬁdence, and that was the
difference.”

The Panthers came as close as two points
following a pair of Loliya Briggs free throws
with 14:28 remaining. But the Dukes’ shoot-

’ ing prowess whenever the Panthers seemed

to pull close proved too much in the 31st
meeting between the two teams.

Pitt still leads the all—time series 19-12.

Despite suffering an injury, Kiesel led
the Panthers in scoring with 17 points on
6-of-16 shooting. Logan recorded a double-
double for the Panthers, scoring 15 points
to go along with 10 rebounds.“I sensed the
physical nature of the game, but it is just
something Ihave to‘ handle,” said Logan, a
junior forward and Pitt’s leading scorer on
the season. “Being down-low, I am--a little
quicker, so I just need to utilize my speed
more and get to my game.”

Pitt will now have aweek off for ﬁnal
exams before the team returns to the court.
Seeking coach Berenato’s record-breaking
victory, the Panthers will resume play
against Rider at 1 p.m. Dec. 16 at the Pe-
tersen Events Center. I I

COLUMN

Graduating seniors witnessed a wild few years in Pitt sports

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

-I quickly immersed myself in this Univer-
‘sity’s athletic fan culture when I came to‘Pitt
in 2009. But I wishsomebody had warned
me that membership -in the worldof Pitt
sports came with the added risks of heart
problems and thepremature sprouting of
gray hairs. V ‘

Over the course of the past three and a
half years, Pitt sports have given fans and
students much to talk, laugh, scream and
cry about. But more than anything, it has
given us as students something to cheer for
as a Pitt family.

I have attended Pitt football and bas-
ketball games since I was 10 years o1d.»But
the camaraderie among the students in the
newly deemed Panther Pitt, and especially
in the Oakland Zoo, is another experience
entirely. To experience an athletic envi-
ronment in which basketball players con-
tinually credit the student section for their

victories, and in some cases even cite the ‘

Zoo as one of their reasons to attend the
University of Pittsburgh, is a major credit to
the fans. I often found my home in the Zoo,
where the accumulation of loyalty points
is valued more than any perfect class at-
tendance record.

I’ve been through ups and downs with

Pitt sports, having watched the Pitt football
team travel to Birmingham not once, not

twice, but now three times for the BBVA

‘Compass'Bowl—. " ‘  . _ ,
I have had a different football coach in
charge for almost every year of my under-
graduate studies. Dave, Wannstedt resigned.
Mike Haywood was hired and ﬁred within
two weeks. Todd Graham was hired and
left to coach Arizona ‘State after just a year.
There was never a dull moment in Pitt foot-
ball. Now, Pitt fans hope Paul Chryst will
bringorder and stability to the football
program. , ,.

Other memorable lowlights of Pitt ath-
letics include the football team’s losses to
Youngstown State and Bowling Green. Re-
member the basketball team’s loss to Long
Beach State last season by 10 points‘? Ouch.

e ~ Similarly, I watched with mixed emo-

tions as the Pitt basketball team was
crowned champions of the CBI Tourna-
ment in 2011. I remember the paralyzing
feeling of defeat when Villanova’s Scottie
Reynolds scored the game-winning shot to
send the Wildcats to th’e,Final,Four, and the
shock of No. 1-seed Pitt losing to Butler in
the third round of the NCAA Tournament
two years ago.

I watched unforgettable players take to
the ﬂoor, including Brad Wanamaker, Ash-

‘-4’.-

ton Gibbs and Nasir Robinson. Now, they

are continuing to pursue their basketball
dreams abroad. With players like these, I’ll
never forget when I cheered so loudly that I
was almost written up for a noise violation
in Tower A after Pitt defeated West Virginia
in triple overtime.

Heavily touted recruits ﬁzzled out and
left, like Khem Birch. Others prospered and
moved on to the NBA, like Dejuan Blair and
Sam Young. I was there for Pitt’s ﬁrst Mid-
night Madness event this year, which drew
thousands of people for the Homecoming
celebration of Pitt’s 225th Anniversary.

When I look in the basketball stands, I
still see familiar faces: Carl Krauser, Lev-
ance Fields and Nick'Rivers. The image of
Rivers dancing in the pregame huddle will
always be a fond memory. I watched former
Panthers Marcus Bowman and Julius Page
return to Pitt as commentators, and quar-
terback Pat Bostick as football announcer.

That’s what is special about Pitt: People
don’t want to leave. It’s a family.

I was privileged to watch one of the most
talented coaches in college basketball, Ja-
mie Dixon, sprint up and down the sidelines
and Wave his arms like a madman. He is a
basketball mastermind, an inspiration and
a true asset to the University. I watched him
bring in some of the most talented recruit-
ing classes Pitt has seen in decades, includ-
ing McDonald’s All—American Dante Taylor

and this year’s gem at the point guard slon;
James Robinson. In addition, Dixon’s loyal
and trustworthy coaching staff, including
former Panther great Brandin Knight, are
not to be undervalued.

I have developed a serious love—hate re-
lationship with quarterback Tino Sunseri

depending on the given Saturday. I have‘

been witness to unbelievable stories of per-
sonal triumph, such as that of Dan Mason
recovering from a devastating knee injury
and taking the ﬁeld again this year. In the
Temple game this season, Mason suffered a
lacerated liver, but his spirit has never died.

During my time at Pitt, the school be-
came known as “Running Back U.” LeSean
“Shady” McCoy, Dion Lewis and Ray Gra-
ham ran all over Heinz Field during my ﬁrst
three years at Pitt, and wide receiver Jon
Baldwin made equally impressive catches,

I’ll never forget losing by a single point
to Cincinnati in 2009. Pitt gave up a three-
touchdown lead and a trip to the BCS game
during the de facto Big East Championship
game. The Bearcats, led by then-head coach
Brian Kelly, won the conference champion-
ship in a crushing blow to the spirits of Pitt
fans everywhere.

But that wasn’t the last time the Pan-
thers went neck-and-neck with a Brian Kelly

No. 1, BCS Championship—bound Notre
Dame Fighting Irish into three overtime
periods in South Bend, Ind., this year? Or
"taking Charlie Weis’ Irish into four overtime
periods to ultimately win the game in 2009?
Certainly these are moments Pitt fans will
never forget. *

In my time at Pitt, track and ﬁeld star
Brycen Spratling crushed school racing
records. The gymnastics team continu-
ally boasts the highest GPA of all athletic
teams on campus. The wrestling team won
three consecutive Eastern Wrestling League
championships, and the baseball, softball
and men’s and wom.en’s soccer teams were
built a brand—new, state—of—the-art facility
to callhome: the Petersen Sports Complex.

I don’t know what the future’ holds for
me. But I do know this: I’ll never forget the
energy of the Oakland Zoo as the lights turn
down for player introductions. Or the loud
roar of the football crowd for the retirement
of beloved band director Jack Anderson.
Or the feeling from the Panther Pitt when
I_ sang “Sweet Caroline” for the ﬁrst time.

As soon as the ball is kicked at Heinz
Field or tippedat the Pete, I’ll be watching
from wherever I am, remembering the great
tradition and history of athletics at this
great University, and cheering just as hard
as ever. Hail to Pitt. es

there’s]ames’, and it’s empty. It’s just very few
mental mistakes,” Dixon said. “There are just
no mental mistakes, and that’s so valuable.”

After keying the comeback against Oak-
land, Robinson experienced something that
he isn’t very familiar with: a loss. The Pan-
thers eventually fell to No. 4 Michigan on
Nov. 21, but Robinson did everything in his
power to try to avoid defeat.

With Pitt down ﬁve late and the contest
seemingly over, the freshman didn’t quit,
scoring six points in the game’s ﬁnal 30 sec-
onds. It wasn’t enough to complete a miracu-
lous comeback, but yet again, one thing was
obvious:]ames Robinson will compete until
the ﬁnal buzzer.

“I deﬁnitely feel we need to play a lot
harder, play tougher,” Robinson said after
the game. “We got out-rebounded and beat
in transition tonight. I think those two things
we need to work on.”

Pitt (9-1) hasn’t lost since.

Just last week, Robinson received the Big

“The pressure’s
not on me, and

on as a team.”
James Robinson

East Freshman of the Week award after he
averaged 11 points and seven assists in two

games against Howard and Detroit. Even

with his personal recognition, Robinson re-
mains unselﬁsh and credits his teammates.

“[Winning the award] feels good,” Rob~
inson said. “I’d say it’s kind of a team award.
That’s the way I look at it because if I didn’t
have my teammates, then Iwou1dn’t be able
to get it. It’s a small step for me personally,
but we have a greater potential as a team that
we’re trying to reach.”

As for Robinson’s winning ways at both
DeMatha and Pitt, he again credits those
around. him for the success he enjoys.

“At DeMatha, I was coached by a lot of
great coaches and had a lot of great players
alongside me, so I guess the winning came
not easy, but a little bit easier than it maybe
could have,” Robinson said. “And I feel like
that came to Pittsburgh as well. We have a
great coaching staff and a lot of great players,
so all the pressure’s not on me, and we kind
of take it on as a team.” ﬂ

wrestlers still up.

No. 14 Max Thomusseit at 184 pounds suf-
fered his ﬁrst defeat of the season, 3-2, to Mary-
land’s No. 9_]immy Sheptock. The two remained
tied 1-1 in the third period with both wrestlers
scoring only on escapes, but Thomusseit had
more than a minute of riding time. Sheptock
was able to score a late takedown to keep the
Terps alive in the team match.

But Maryland’s hopes for a dual—match win
didn’t look good with Pitt’s No. 2 Matt Wilps
taking on No. 13 Christian Boley. Despite hav-
ing only an 11-spot difference in the rankings,
Wilps didn’t have much trouble with the Terps’

197—pounder. Wilps cruised to a 7-2 victory.

The night was once again capped with a
win for No. 9 Zac Thomusseit. Last week the
team needed a pin. With the win locked up this
week, Thomusseit still turned in a dominating
performance.

The heavyweight won 7-0 and was suc-
cessﬁil in stopping any offensive attacks from
Maryland’s Carl Buchholz. After securing a
takedown, Thomusseit was able to hold down
Buchholz — who had aweight advantage — for
the majority of the match.
