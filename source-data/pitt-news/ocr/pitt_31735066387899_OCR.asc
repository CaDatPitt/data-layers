A campus—wide ban on
smoking will go into effect on
Feb. 1, Pitt President Wesley
Posvar announced yesterday.

“With few exceptions the
University of Pittsburgh will ban
smoking,” Posvar told a meeting

of the University Senate Council.
“This is in compliance with the
city code; it is required by the city
code.”

Pitt currently prohibits smoking

' in most common or public areas

but allows smoking in private
offices at the discretion of the
occupants. The new policy will
ban smoking in all areas,

 

including private offices. Posvar
said people who need to smoke
can ask for one smoking room to
be set aside in their area, but the
room will have to be approved
by the supervisor in that area and
then by a specialist in
environmental health.

The areas that will be approved
are those “that are carefully

inspected, have good ventilation
and ventilation which will not
carry the effects of smoking on to
other parts of the university,”
Posvar said.

If a room is turned down as a
designated smoking room, this
ruling by the environmental
specialist will be ﬁnal, according
to Posvar.

‘‘If a place is turned down, it
will be turned down for technical,
explicit reasons. And I think we
should use every option in
helping the parties concerned
find an alternative,” Posvar said.

Posvar said that Pitt’s decision
is parallel to the steps that many

New bus sbelter gets mixed reviews

By Marietta Pacella
Sta_[7‘W1-iter

The $15,000 spent by the
Student Government Board to
build a bus shelter at the Cathedral
of Learning campus bus stop has
raised a variety of positive and
negative responses from Pitt
students.

Though a random survey
showed dissatisfaction with the
shelter’s size to be unanimous,
the opinions regarding the money
spent on the shelter varied.

Letty Wright, a student at the
School of Social Work, said, “lt’s
a waste of money. I don’t like it.
It’s not big enough. If it was
enlarged, itwould be wonderful.”

Moses McKize, a junior in the
College of Arts and Sciences,

agreed with Wright but offered
other complaints as well. McKize
was disappointed in the large
space between the ground and
the bottom of the shelter walls.

‘‘It’s too small, and it’s too cold.
They should fill in that gap near
the ground. They should have
put the walls closer to the ground.
All the cold air blows in, and you
wind up freezing cold,” he said.

CAS student Dan T albeit agreed
with McKize and expanded upon
the issue.

“The whole shelter is too
skinny. I mean, who wants to
stand in a bus shelter like a bunch
of sardines? It’s bad enough you
have to do it on the campus bus.
To top it off, the ceiling’s not long
enough so all the rain blows in,
and you wind up soaking wet.

You can’t stay dry unless you
stand toward the center of it. But
then there’s a big—ass hole around
the bottom of it, and your feet get
soaked. You can’t win with that
thing. It’s a waste.

“For all the money that was
spent on it, I thought it was going
to look like it belonged there. I
expected it to be Gothic or
something for $15,000. It’s
Plexiglas. It’s so damn ugly,” he
said.

Stasia Rieger and Tracey
Johnson felt that the shelter was
a smart idea, until they were told
that it cost the university $15,000
to build it.

“Are you kidding me?” asked
Rieger.

But not everyone felt that the

Pitt may drop tuition
challenge program

Pitt will almost certainly not participate in the state’s tuition-
challenge grant program next year, according to Pitt President

“The indication is that the tuition—challenge grant will not be
repeated next year. It will probably be dropped. It has become
so burdensome administratively,” Posvar said at the University
Senate Council meeting yesterday.

Gov. Robert Casey’s tuition program provides $100 for every
undergraduate student if state universities limit tuition hikes to
under 6 percent or $100 per student.

“Whether we consider the price of education as too high or
not in terms of tuition, the fact is that the challenge—grant system
has worked against the two large urban—based universities that
have a lot of part—time students and have a decent amount of

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, January 15, 1991

 

How to become a conscientious objector

( The following is a special Know
Your Rights written by Pitt News
staff writer Mark Smith and Rae
jean Stephens from tbeA merican
Civil Liberties Union.)

With the threat of war in the
Middle East, many students are
concerned about a potential draft.
Presently, men over 18 years of
age are required by law to register
with the Selective Service. An
actual draft would have to be
enacted by Congress. You have
certain options if Congress enacts
the draft.

Question: What is a
conscientious objector?

Stephens: A conscientious
objector is someone in a time of
war who refuses to ﬁght because
it is against his/her conscience
according to convictions based
on morality or personal
conviction.

Q: Do I have to be strictly
religious to be a CO?
Stephens: No. Your belief

simply needs to be sincere and
strong —— it doesn’t have to be
religious. If an individual holds
sincere beliefs that are purely
ethical or moral, can be proven
and make him/her con-
scienti ously object to participating
in war, he/she is considered
religious and may claim CO status.

Q: Can I be a CO for political

or pragmatic reasons?
Stephens: Anyone who deeply
and sincerely objects to all war is
eligible for CO status, but your
objections can’t be based solely
on political or policy concerns.
For example, you can’t say, “I
don’t believe in war because it is
an archaic form of settling
disputes.” You must have moral
and ethical grounds as well.

Q: Can I still be required to
serve the military but only in
non-combative positions?

Smith: It depends. If you
cannot be involved in any way
with war, you will be able to
obtain CO status that exempts
you from even non—combative
military supportive positions.

Q: Could I be drafted if I’m a
lesbian, gaymanorabisexual?

Smith: No. The only way you
could be drafted and serve in the
U.S. armed forces is if you are
secretive about your sexual
orientation. Unlike heterosexuals,
you have a choice. If you are

secretive, you may go. If you are
open, they'll drop you like a hot
potato. This is an ironic benefit
because the U.S. military
discriminates on the basis of
sexual orientation.

Q: If I have ﬂat feet, will this
exempt me?
Smith: Probably not. It depends
on the need of the armed services.

Q: IfI want to sign up as a
CO, what should I do?
Smith: You should start the
process as soon as possible.

together a letter that will be given
to Pitt President Wesley Posvar.
In that letter, the faculty makes
three points.

“One: we oppose the United
States launching a war against
Iraq. Two: we call on University
of Pittsburgh President Wesley
Posvar to voice the university’s
opposition to war in the Persian
Gulf to President Bush. It is the
university’s mission to educate
our country’s young people for
productive lives. War in the
Persian Gulf is contrary to that
mission. Three: If war is initiated,
we call for a one-day moratorium
of all classes at the University of
Pittsburgh ...”

The letter said the day without
classes would be spent discussing
the issues at hand.

Another faculty member,
Dennis Brutus, chairperson of
the black studies department, told

33; students about a factory outside

of Boston whose services have
been called upon by the U.S.
government.

“When ‘I was in Boston, I
learned that there was a factory
outside Boston with an order
from the Defense Department for
1,600 body bags a day,” Brutus
said. “They expect 55,000
casualties. They call [the body
bags] ‘human- remains
containers.”

Brutus said students must
confront this preparation for war.

“We must organize our protests,
our public opposition, and we
must continue to build that
opposition until we cannot be
ignored —— until we put an end to
this insanity, this stupidity, this
destruction. We must say together,
‘No blood for oil.’”

' Two representatives from the
Thomas Merton Center also
spoke.

Molly Rush, a longtime anti-
war activist, told students about
growing opposition to the war.

“I got a call today from a man
whose son was shipped out to
Saudi Arabia,” Rush said. “lThe
father] was in Washington during
the current debates. He said that
for the first time in his life, he
wanted to join a protest. That’s
the kind of phone calls we’re
getting at the Thomas Merton
Center, day after day.”

Vietnam veteran David
Hockabout, from the Thomas
Merton Center, presented his
problems with the gulf crisis.

“Fifteen—year-olds have ‘been
drafted into Iraq’s army,” said
Hockabout. “When war breaks
out, children will die.”

Hockabout also discussed
racism as an aspect of war.

“There has never been, in the
history of the United States, a war
that racism has been a part of,”
Hockabout said. He referred to
the Indian wars, where white
men used ethnic slurs to refer to
the enemy.

“When we fought in Vietnam
and Korea, we referred to those
people as ‘gooks.’ [We called] the

See Peace, page 4

War

Continued from page 1
Iraq will be advantageous to the
United States.

There are also students on
campus who agree that the United
States must take action against
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

According to junior history
major Dan Stantz, there is a
historical analogy between
Saddam and Adolf Hitler.

“Actions must be taken. As
shown with Hitler, sanctions and
appeasement are not enough,”
Stantz said.

“We must do something before
Saddam Hussein runs all over the
Middle East. He’s already in one
country for no apparent reason.
Even if he says he won’t do this,
there is no reason we should
believe him,” he said.

Economics favor the U.S.
involvement in Kuwait, according
to sophomore John Haller, an
economics and German major.

“I’m not in favor of war; no one
is in favor of war. [But] our
economy depends almost all on
fuel. We need oil. In the past we
should have developed other

resources to use for fuel. If we let
our oil fall into the hands of a
madman, we could fall into a
severe recession or perhaps even
a depression. In that case, we’re
justified,” said Haller,

Haller also said that the United
States should become involved
because Iraq has violated the
rights of people in Kuwait.

He said, “It’s a pity that people
have to die for this, but we can’t
just let it go by.”

Sophomore Tina Negi also
believes that the United States is
fighting for the rights of people.

“My conception is that it is not
a war for oil —— that we are
fighting for people’s freedom
here. I’ve heard rumors that
Kuwait is a slave nation and so on
and so forth. I don’t believe that.
That information has yet to be
verified. It’s all nothing but a
scam. I don’t think it is about oil.

The reason that it has been
[perceived] that way is that people
want to put a black name on
[President] Bush’s reason for going
into the Middle East. We are
taking action against terrorists
here. It is plain and simple," Negi
said.

Although there is support for
U.S. involvement in Kuwait, there
is also support for those who are
protesting the war.

Negi said, “I don’t like to see
people that don’t care. I mean I
would like to see a war not
happen; I really would. I mean, I
am anti-war too."

Kehl also commented on the
anti-war movement.

“Anyone can appreciate the
desire to save lives as well as
natural resources. Maybe we'll
never know who’s right,” he said.

Germans, ‘Krauts’ and the
Japanese, ‘Japs’ or ‘Nips.’ Men
are now told they will kill
‘Ragheads,”’ Hockabout said.

Local activist Vince Eirene also
spoke at the camp. He started out
his speech by reading a letter
from a friend who had stayed at
Dunken and Porter, Eirene’s
shelter, years before. This friend
is now in the Navy and is stationed
in Saudi Arabia.

“I do miss civilization. It is so
bad,” said the friend in the letter.
Eirene did not give the person’s
name or location for fear of
someone discovering his friend’s
identity. The friend could be in

trouble with the military for
speaking out, according to Eirene.

Eirene then led the students in
meditation. He asked students to
close their eyes, to picture
themselves 10 years in the future
and to predict what the world
would be like if the war continued
that long.

“Now look at yourself, and
look at what changes have to
take place in order to change
that,” said Eirene.

Jonathon Harris of the Pitt
Faculty for Social Responsibility
told the peace camp that he felt
the United States should give
economic sanctions against Irag
more time to take effect.

money spent on the shelter was
a total waste. In fact, some were
in favor of the $15,000 iﬂV€SUT1€ﬂI-

“I think it was a good money
decision. I use it every day to go
to the fraternity houses. It’s great
for [rainy] days like today,” said
Walt Lehmann, a freshman.

Maaza Haile, a student in the
Joseph M. Katz Graduate School
of Business, thinks the shelter is
long overdue.

“It’s great. We've needed it for
a long time. The only problem is
that it is too small, and not
everyone knows that it’s here for
the campus bus. Everyone still
stands outside,” she said.

On this rainy day there were
several people standing outside
the shelter.

Greta Manikowski, a fifth—year
pharmacy student, didn’t know
the shelter was for the campus
bus, and Cynthia Fleischer wasn’t
quite sure if it was a designated
smoking or non—smoking area.

“I’m just trying to be
considerate. Non—smokers have
trained me well. When I’m done
with my cigarette, I’ll probably
go stand under the shelter, too. I
like the new shelter. It keeps me
dry," she said. '

Manikowski also had several
ideas to improve the shelter.

“I think they should post a
campus bus schedule inside the
shelter so that we won't have to
stand there forever, not knowing
when the next bus is due. They
could also remind people not
only when the bus runs during
the day, but also when it runs in
terms of each semester,” she said.

Manikowski also suggested that
several safety features be added
to the shelter. She believes it
would be a good investment to
have a light placed in the shelter,
along with an emergency phone
to call the campus police. '

Violation of the new Pitt policy
could result in a $50 fine which
will be enforced and collected by
the city of Pittsburgh.

“I do not plan on picking up
the phone to call 911 and saying,
’There is a guy out smoking in the
hallway.’ We are going to be
reasonable about this, but the
message is not to smoke,” said
John Yeager, vice president for
administration.

Posvar said that his decision
has the support of the majority of
the university community.

“I agree with the policy, and

I’m a smoker. Two things I think

it will do: It will help those who ’

have trouble with smoke, and it
might help those who are
smokers,”Joseph Cavalla, director
of student activities, said.

William Harmon, vice president
for student affairs, agreed.

“Well, I think from a health
standpoint, it’s an important
decision,” Harmon said.

Other smokers weren’t pleased
with the policy.

‘‘I am a smoker, and I don’t
think this is wise. It is an
unenlightened decision,”
graduate student Davina
Robinson said.

“If we are in a small environment
where we can't smoke, then fine.
But don’t take all of my rights
away,” sophomore Jen Kormuth
said.

Pitt is helping to protect
students’ health by banning
smoking, said junior Beth Ingber.

“Everyone knows the damage
secondhand smoke can do. Now
people won’t be allowed to
endanger others because of their
personal choices,” Ingber said.

out-of-state students,” he said.
“The grant applies only to full-
time, in—state students
undergraduate, not graduate, not

professional.”

The tuition—challenge program
has come under fire since Casey
cut it 50 percent for this year.

Posvar met Thursday with
deans and directors to discuss his
proposal for the $5.5 million
which Casey additionally cut from
the budget last Monday. Posvar’s
plan includes rescheduling

renovation and repairs of offices
and temporarily leaving open
faculty positions which are
unexpectedly vacated.

The possibility also exists, he
said, for up to a half-percent cut
in the current funding of academic
areas and a one-percent cut in
administrative areas.

“This will not have anyeffect
directly on next year’s budget.
These are reductions in current
funds,” Posvar said. “It is, of
course, a bad omen for next
year’s budget.”

Tiaereturn of D-Day. ..

June 6, 1944: Allied troops stormed the beaches of
France as a last resort to force the Germans to withdraw

_ from France. Although thousands of Allied troops lost

their lives, the action brought a quicker close to World
War 11 than ordinarily would have been the case.

Jan. 15, 1991 (or any date thereafter): Allied countries
launch an attack on Iraq to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait.

_ Thousands of Allied troops lose their lives, when another

option could have been used. This is the scenario
currently facing the world.

When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the world was
outraged. It showed its anger by passing a series of
historical resolutions in the United Nations against Iraq.
The United Nations instituted a complete economic
embargo which not only restricted Iraq from exporting
oil, its main source of income, but also stopped food
imports fromentering the country.

These sanctions had never been imposed on any
country in the history of the United Nations. They were

i so complete and overwhelming that supposedly, no

country would be able to survive them economically. The
country would eventually have to stop its offending
practice to get any relief.

According to the United Nations, though, this was not
enough. In November the United Nations declared that
after today the countries of the world could use “all
necessary means” to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.

In an attempt to enforce this deadline, President Bush
eventually sent upward of 400,000 American troops into
Saudi Arabia. Other countries also sent either troops or
funds to pay for this massive undertaking.

Now the world faces an almost imminent war, even
though these sanctions have not been given sufficient
time to work.

Saddam has stated that if attacked he will retaliate in
kind against Israel and the coalition forces. But he has not
said anything about the possibility of firing the first shot.
The American forces, under President Bush, seem more
than willing to take care of that part.

America has taken charge of this coalition. No country
will commit forces to battle until the United States does,

«» and may even let the United States do all of the work. But

the United States has not allowed enough time for the
sanctions to do their damage. Now that the deadline is
here, the possibility exists that these historical sanctions
could bethrown away prematurely.

We implore the administration to give more time for the
sanctions to work and to ignore the U.N. deadline. The
only thing that the United States should recognize today
is Martin Luther King }r.’s birthday.

History will repeat...

Should" we   attack?

Sanctions need time

Gary Houston

Lisa Oshop'

It is Jan. 15, and Iraq has not left Kuwait. This is
in direct violation of over a dozen U.N. resolutions.
The entire world has condemned Iraq’s illegal
invasion and brutalization of a peaceful nation.
Iraq has embarked on a program of developing its
own nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein would
like nothing more than to take over Iraq’s weak
neighbors. That is the situation we face on the day
of the U.N. deadline for Iraq’s withdrawal from
Kuwait.

The deadline was necessary because without it
Iraq would have absolutely no incentive to leave
Kuwait. Saddam could resist sanctions for years,
while the U.S.-led, anti-Iraq coalition fell apart and
U.S. citizens lost interest in turning back a brutal
a ggression. This would have been a deadly mistake.
Fortunately, President Bush has the support of
Congress and over 70 percent of the American
people. And according to the latest polls, over 60
percent of Americans support immediate military
action. That signifies a definite majority.

President Bush has seen the need to turn back
this illegal act because of the consequences if we
don’t. Having one brutal dictator controlling the
vast majority of the world’s oil is pure stupidity. All
the protesters chant, “No blood for oil,” but that is
not the main issue. When oil goes up to $100 a
barrel and the price of everything from heating oil
to food skyrockets, everybody suffers. And turning
back this aggression by any .means necessary
illustrates to any future aggressors that this activity
will not be tolerated in the post—Cold War world.

Here on campus you can look around and see
quite a bit of left-wing rabble—rousing. These war
protesters are well-intentioned but are completely
misinformed and misled. Their reasoning, or rather,
the lack thereof, is convoluted and ignorant of the
basic facts of the situation. I suppose they don’t see
anything wrong with letting a murderous dictator
subjugate his smaller neighbors and gain a
chokehold on the world’s economy. If they are so
worried about the horrors of war, then why can’t
they realize that 100 times more bloodshed will
occur if Hussein isn't stopped and his war-making
capability isn’t eliminated? But these people would
rather ignore the lessons of history. If you try to
rationalize any war as evil, then you condemn an
untold number of innocent people to certain
death. The mistakes of the 1930s cannotbe repeated.
It’s as simple as that.

GaryHouston is a sophomore majoring in political
science and economics.

Saddam Hussein missed today’s deadline to
withdraw from Kuwait, but this does not mean we
should go to war. President Bush's attempts to
argue for a gulf war show instead the necessity for
a diplomatic solution. (Excerpts from his essay
published in Newsweek are in italics.)

"First, the world must not reward aggression.”

The world hasn't. Let the embargo and the
blockade continue. Bush was advised at the outset
that it would take up to 18 months, possibly, for the
economic sanctions to begin to work. There is no
reason to declare after ﬁve and a half months that
the sanctions are taking too long to work. Bush
should have consulted world leaders before
committing so many Americans to the gulf. He
undermines his “new world order” by insisting on
U.S. command and control. By using diplomacy
and sharing leadership, Bush stands a greater
chance of holding together a long-term international
coalition against Hussein. "

“Second, our national security is at stake. ”

By this, Bush means oil, which he calls “the
world's economic lifeline." Oil is considered a
priceless commodity, but now is the time to consider
using alternative energy sources. According to
Ha1per’s “Harper’s Index,” America imports
290,000,000 barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia each
year. By adjusting the fuel-efliciency standard on
U.S. cars by 2.75 miles per gallon, we could save
exactly that much oil. In the meantime this crisis
could give us incentive to explore the possibilities
of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, rather than risk
lives over an outdated and environmentally unsound
energy source. .

”Last, innocent lives are at stake.”

Iraq has promised that”many will burn.” Tens of
thousands of civilians will die in a gulf war, as will
American and allied military personnel. If Iraq lives
up to its threat to bomb Israel if the United States
strikes first, then Arab countries may consider this
as a war between the Arabs, and Israel and its allies.
This complicates our position there and adds to the
possibility of a long, drawn—out war. Even if Saddam
Hussein is ousted, he has already killed any
contender for his position and has named his son-
in-law, Hussein Kamel Majid, as his successor. The
Oct 29 issue of Newsweek predicts that a leaderless
Iraq could cause unforeseen destruction in the
Middle East as neighboring countries vie for co ntrol.
This will notbe a ﬁve-day conﬂict The repercussions
of a gulf war may last for years.

Lion tamed...

Women's sw

By Arthur Graziani
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swim team
lost its second meet of the year to
15th-ranked Penn State this
weekend, despite swimming one
of its best meets of the season.

PSU won by a score of 177.5 to
122.5, but the Lady Panthers, a
serious underdog going into the
meet, showed their formidable
ability.

Pitt (S-2) got a tough break
early. After taking first place in
the 200—yard individual medley,

‘the Lady Panthers were disqual-

iﬁed for a false start. It gave Penn
State a lead it never relinquished.

As in all other sports involving
Pitt and PSU, the rivalry was as
heated as ever.

“They are as motivated for this
meet as any dual meet we have,”
said head coach David Belowich.

“I think it’s tradition. When you
go to either school, you learn
automatically that you ’re rivals,’.’
said senior freestyle swimmer
Celeste Makiel. “But with
swimming it’s' not a hated rival,
like maybe in football. We have
great respect for them and vice
versa.” .

Fellow senior Laura-Lee
Sullivan added that knowing the
competition so well also adds to
the incentive. “A lot of their
swimmers come from our area,
so we’ve been competing against

The Lady Panthers swim team fellgto 15th-ranked Penn State, 177.5-122.5 on Saturday, dropping their season record to 5-2.

each other for years,” she said.
Nowhere was that more evident
than in the 1000—yard relay.
Theresa Picklo battled Heather
Nicholson down to the wire,
winning by less than two seconds.
Picklo, who also won the 500-
yard race, is one of the main

reasons for Pitt’s ear1y—season‘

success. “I expect a lot from
myself," said Picklo, “We haven’t
had a competitive race in over a
month. So we had to get used to
racing again. So in that respect
I’m happy with the results, but
I’m not satisfied.”

Another exciting race was the
50 freestyle. Junior Christine
Gallagher won the race with a
time of 24.56 seconds, just .15
seconds better than PSU’s second-
place swimmer, Jennifer Baird.
Gallagher was in third after 25
yards, but she poured it on in the
final 10 to pull out the first-place
finish.

Pitt swimmers also took ﬁrst in
the 100- and 200-yard breast-
stroke. Sullivan won the 100 with
a time of 1:07.63. Junior Karin
Masal took second in the 100 and
won the 200 with a time of 2:27.02.

Combined eﬁfort leads Pitt
/aoc/eey club to 10-6 victory

The United States is approaching a war,

And Masal appreciates the win.
“It’s real good competition for
[the Eastern Women’s Swimming
League Championships]. This is
our toughest dual meet”

Pitt definitely had its best
showing of the year in the diving
competition. Senior diver Krissa
Ratliff won both the 1- and 3-
meter events, with fellow Lady
Panther Donna Flatch taking
second in both events.

Both sides were suffering from
injuries, as Penn State’s leading

‘ diver Amy Schmidt was unable to

perform because of stitches.

Flatch, despite her second-place
finish, was hobbled by an ankle
injury.

Flatch wasn’t performing up to
her standards because of an ankle
injury, in addition to a twisted
wrist. But with this meet she
seems back on track. Just ask
Ratliff.

“This is the first time I’ve ever
done this well on the 1-rneter and
the 3—meter. I really feel set for
Easterns and Nationals. But I’m
happiest about how well Donna

dove today. She qualified for ‘

NCAA prequals on both boards.”

Freshman Kloiber
displays mature
attitude on the mat

By Christopher Block
Staff Writer

From the moment he
stepped onto the wrestling mat,
there was no doubt. No doubt
that for the second match in a
row, freshman Jeff Kloiber
would come through for Pitt
Coach Rande Stottlemyer.

The first time Kloiber worked
his magic was onjan. 8 against
third—ranked Arizona State. In
that match he was one of only
three wrestlers to register a
victory against the Sun Devils’
senior 190-pound wrestler
Kelly Gonzales. Kloiber
cunningly deceived the older
Gonzales on two different
occasions and was able to
register two takedowns on his
way to a 5-1 decision.

Although he performed well
against the Sun Devils, that
match was only a warm-up for
last Friday’s meeting with the
Lehigh Engineers. In that match
the Panthers started out slowly,
dropping the first five matches
before Scott Hovan and Sean
Gibbs were able to swing the
Panthers into the winning
column. After junior Joe
Hilferty lost a tough contest,
the spotlight turned to the 190-
pound weight class and
Kloiber.

The situation looked grave
for the Panthers as Kloiber

prepared himself to compete.
He would have to register at
least a technical fall, which is
a win by 15 points or more, to
give the Panthers a chance at
tying the Engineers.

Kloiber wasted little time in
pouncing on Lehigh’s junior
grappler Eric Ha gberg. Kloiber
did not appear nervous at all.
In fact, he later admitted, “I
felt pretty confident going in.
I wanted a pin.” With that in
mind, Kloiber set out to pin
Hagberg and bring the
Panthers closer to their first
victory.

After the two wrestlers
circled the mat, Kloiber set
upon his prey like a cat to a
mouse. And it wasn’t even
close. Following the
completion of the first period,
Kloiber led 4-0 on two
takedowns. In the second
period, Kloiber started with an
escape and a takedown.
Following close to a minute of
riding time, the freshman took
control of the match by rolling
Hagberg onto his back.

Although he was unable to
register a pin, he accumulated
three important points for
holding his opponents back to
the mat. These three points
proved to be important
because Kloiber gained more
points in the third period. His

Five Panther tracksters

By Rob Codispot
staﬂ“ Writer

Five Pitt Panthers qualiﬁed for the IC4A
Track Championships Saturday at the
Michigan Relays at Eastern Michigan
University in Ypsilanti.

The IC4A Championships will be held
Saturday, March 2, at Princeton University.

“For the first meet since coming back
from [holiday] break, I thought we did
pretty well,” Pitt Coach John Vasvary said.

 

 

“There were some pretty good teams like
Eastern Michigan and Michigan, and we
got a lot of really good performances.”

The meet’s best performance came
from Brian Whitley, who finished first and
set a personal record in the 55—meter dash
with a time of 6.40 seconds.

Derek Pratt, who ﬁnished ﬁfth, joined
Whitley in qualifying for the lC4A
Championships with a time of 6.52 seconds.

Whitley also qualiﬁed for IC4As, along
with Brett Shields, Justin Walls and Elbert

time of 3:198. Whitley also ﬁnished third
in the 200 with 22.41.

“I was pleased with Brian’s effort,"
Vasvary said. “That was a great way for
him to start the season.”

Two Panthers also qualiﬁed for IC4As
in the 55~meter hurdles. Ellis finished ﬁrst
at 7.3 seconds, a time that also made him
a provisional qualiﬁer for the NCAA
Championships. Shields’ time of 7.52
seconds was good enough for third.

who won the mile with a time of 4:135.

14:53.26, and Walls ﬁnished second in the

Bulls 'playoffbopes rest on next two games

By Ethan Lott
For The Pitt News

One game into the 1991 pro
lacrosse season, the Pittsburgh

\ Bulls, who spent their inaugural

season looking up the standings
at the rest of the league, are
looking to play for a
championship.

The next two weeks will be the
first big test for the Bulls as they
take on their division rivals, the
Detroit Turbos, first on the road
and then at the Civic Arena. The
Turbos are coming off an
impressive thrashing of
Philadelphia, last year’s Major
Indoor Lacrosse League
champions, by 10 goals.

Bulls General Manager Haswell
Franklin Jr. considers the Turbos

Wrestle

last-minute takedown, combined
with an additional point for riding
time, enabled Kloiber to defeat
Hagberg 18-3 and give Pittsburgh
the technical fall that it so
desperately needed.

Kloiber was obviously pleased
as he discussed the evening’s
match. “I didn’t really feel any
added pressure. I felt that I had to
wrestle strongly in order to win.”

Later, assistant coach Jim
Beichner was all smiles as he
talked about his freshman
prodigy.

“I think Jeffsgoing to be a
good wrestler. He has a lot of
drive,” said Beichner. “If everyone
on our team wrestled like Jeff
Kloiber, we wouldn’t have close
matches like this one. He's a
super—quality kid ”

the toughest opponent the Bulls
(3-5 last year) will face.

“I think we’re one of the two
best teams in the league. Detroit
is the other,” Franklin said.

Like the Bulls, Detroit was also
a second-division team last year,
finishing 1-7, but beating Philly
proved they can contend this
yeah

The Bulls are hoping to stake
their claim the next two weeks
against Detroit.

The Bulls’ Brian Nikula, who
led the MILL in goals last season,
said, “I don’t think it’s the smartest
scheduling, but it could end up
coming down to these two
games.”

The Bulls and the Turbos play
in the National Division of the
MILL along with the New England

Blazers, last year’s regular—season
champs at 6-2.

The American Division consists
of the Baltimore Thunder (4-4
last season), the New York Saints
(4-4) and the Philadelphia Wings
(6-2).

This year’s playoffs have shrunk
from four teams to two, with the
two division champs playing one
game for the league
championship. This makes the
Bulls’ games with Detroit
especially importantbecause only
one of the teams can make the

' playoffs.

The Detroit game will feature
Syracuse’s famed Gait brothers,
Gary and Paul, called the best

' tandem ever to lace on a pair of

turf shoes.
In a preseason game the Turbos

nipped the Bulls 16-14. In that
game Gary had five goals and
one assist, and Paul had a trio of
each, accounting for over half of

’ Detroit's offense.

Nikula downplayed the
importance of the preseason
meeting. “In the preseason neither
team had their whole team there,
and a lot of different people got
to play. I don’t think it was a fair
indicator.”

“I think we have the only two
guys in the league who can match
up with the Gaits: Ron Klauser
and [former Johns Hopkins
defensive star] Dave Pietramala.”

Pietramala, who was the MVP
of the World Games this summer,
is experienced at guarding Gary.

“I’ve played against him the
past four years —- three in college,

including the 1989 NCAA
championship game which
Syracuse won 12-11. [Also] in the
World Games, where [the United
States] beat [Canada] twice in
winning the championship,” said
Pietramala. “It takes more intense
mental preparation for me to be
at the top of my game, and I think
I’ve done quite well in our
matchups.”

The Bulls, who were off last
week, are 1-0 after beating
Baltimore 19-10.

All Bulls home games are 8
p.m. Saturdays in the Civic Arena.
Admission ranges from $11 to
$16.

After Detroit, the Bulls have
home games with New England
on Feb. 16, Philadelphia on March-
9 and New York on March 23.

Hockey

Continued from page 7

The Panthers will also be
traveling south on Saturday to
compete against the Mount-
aineers of West Virginia Un-
iversity. The Mountaineers and
the Panthers share the No. 1
position in the Western
Pennsylvania College Hockey
Association.

Both teams are undefeated

in the league, and as in most
sports there is a strong rivalry
between the two teams. ,

“With the game against West
Virginia on Saturday, we are not
sure where to place our
emphasis,” said Koval. “Both
Duquesne and West Virginia are
our rivals.”

PITT BITS: With this
weekend’s victory the Panthers’

league record moves to 5-0-1,
and their overall record moves to
6-2-1 . . . The Panthers have scored
nine short-handed and 13 power-
play goals this season ... Dave
Koval scored a hat trick during
the second period . . . Steve Karas
earned three penalties, giving him
a total of 35 penalty minutes and
moving himinto second behind
John Carlins, who has 39 penalty

minutes  Returning to the
lineup this weekend will be
Brent Spitzer, who received a
shoulder injury during the first
part of the season. Ed Zevola,
one of the Panthers’
goaltenders, will be out of the
lineup for two weeks with a
sprained knee he received
during the game against Penn
State.

of line in changing its rules just to
keep Pete Rose out.

It seems afraid that since a
player who had off—the-field
problems, FergusonJenkins, and
a player who admitted to cheating
in his career, Gaylord Perry, got
in, the baseball writers might
vote Rose in despite his current
problems.

I’m not saying Charlie Hustle

belongs in the Hall of Fame, but

the voters should make that
choice, and changing the rules to
keep someone out sets a
dangerous precedent.
-Something is really wrong
when the team with the NFL’s
top defense misses the playoffs.
The fact that this refers to the
Steelers says all that needs to be
said about the Joe Walton offense.
As for not having enough talent
on offense, it was those same
offensive players who were in

the playoffs with a lesser defense
last season, and that was without
tight end Eric Green.

If Joe Walton doesn’t go, at
least get rid of running back Tim
Worley. The season- ending loss
to the Oilers was just another
example of the fact that the
Steelers just aren’t good enough
to survive Worley’s mistakes.

of the world is gone. The Pitt
