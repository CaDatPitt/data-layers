Unapproved Houses

A drive to ﬁnd all out-of-town
freshmen and sophomores who are
rooming at unapproved‘ houses has
been opened by Mr. Perry, head of

 

men and sophomores, eliminating
those that live at the homes of rela-
tives and the sophomores who room

the few who are not complyin
with this do “so,” Mr. Perry state .
The freshmen and sophomores
who _ stay at approved houses are
required to sign a contract with
the landlord of their house, and a
copy of this is kept by Mr. Perry.
Besides this, all approved houses
have signed a Housing -Agreement
with the Housing Department.

Dances _ Arranged
. For Celebration

——-—-——n

Plans for welcoming of Pitt
alumni, visitors and Notre Dame
fans for the game next Saturday
between the Panthers and the Ram-
blers at the stadium are near com-
pletion and if present plans go
through, entertainment for these
visitors will rival that of last year
when Ohio State came to Pittsburgh
to play Pitt.

Inasmuch as Notre Dame does
not possess any fraternities, the

fraternity affairs will be for active
members and alumni only. Each
fraternity, however, will hold
luncheons and a dance with the ex-
ception of Kappa Sigma and Delta
Tau Delta who will hold smokers
instead of dances in the evening fol-
lowing the game. The Dental fra-
ternities are co-operating with the
social fraternities in this plan.

George Carson, alumni secretary,
has arranged a smoker which will
take place on Friday, October 24,
and which will be held at the Um-
versity Club. Jock Sutherland and
Knute Rockne, coaches of the Pitt
and Notre Dame football teams, re-
spectively, will be the c ef speak-
ers at this smoker. Mus cal enter-
tainment will also be 1'
this -smoker.

There will be three luncheons on
Saturday evening, October_ 25, at
the University C ub, the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association and the Schen-
ley Hotel. Reservations for the
luncheons and the smoker are being
handled through the office of George
Carson at Room No. 1, House No.
1, Frick Acres.

Special trains will be run to
Pittsburgh from _ Bradford, where
300 Pitt alumni plan to attend the
game; Johnstown, from which 150
alumni will come; Sharon, which
will send 50 Pitt fans here, and
Youngstown, where thirty alumni
plan to -see the grid game.

_, The ticket sale for this game has
been very brisk and but 100 re-
served seats remain unsold. V Walter
Ridley, ticket manager of the sta-
dium, expects to dispose of these be-
fore the end of the week, and then
he will put the 25,000 general ad-
mission tickets on sale. The latter
tickets will be sold fori$1.50 apiece.

By LORE'l'l‘A McOAULEY -

This young thing went into Dr.
Hance’s office Wednesday at four
o’clock and found him blowing into
a bowl which might have been soup
if we didn't know how well our fac-
ulty is “up” on its etiquette. We
did hate to ask him to give up such
an interesting project to tell us
‘what it was all about, for he prob-
ably had used up a lot of wind al-
ready and wouldn’t be in 3. ve good
humor if we asked him to len some
to the Weekly.

But he turned around smiling and
that encouraged us to go on with the
story that we were here again for
an article concerning the zoology
department. This is the way we
started: “Well, Dr. Hance, what
are you doing there?”

He answered in the subtle way we
all know he has and said, “Blowing
into this bowl, of course.” Then

interview was over, we again asked
Dr. Hance why he was blowing in-to
the bowl. He said, “I’m trying to

e thought, “If only he would
stop stalling and get to the point.”
But we repeated our question, “Dr.
H-ance, are you making honey-
combs?”

He said, “No, I told you what
I'm doing; I'm trying to keep_ this
wax from shrinking.” Our stupidity.
We thought he was only fooling,
but Dr. Hance was serious and at
the same time considerate of our
not knowing anything about biolog-
ical experiments, and went on to ex-

lain that paraffin was used as a
basefor tissues which had to be cut
very thin, and then he became very
conﬁdential, tellin us that he had

writer, will be the principal speaker
at the student pep assembly to be

held Friday, October 24, before the
Pitt-Notre Dame football game.

Knute Rockne, coach of the Notre

scheduled'to be ‘the principal s 1(-
er at this assembly but he ffiind
that he had overlooked a previous
agreement to speak before the'Pitts-
burgh Chamber‘ of .Commerce and
said that he would be unable to ap-
pear before the Pitt students at the
scheduled time. .

Rockne May Speak

Rockne, however, promised, Eman-

uel Fishkin, Bus. Ad. ’31, chairman
of student council assembly com-
mittee, that he would be able to
speak here at 2 o’clock should the
latter be able to make the necessary
arrangements. »
‘ This plan would necessitate the
elimination of the ﬁfth hour on that
day. Should Universit ofﬁcials
decide to have a’ specia
during‘ the ﬁfth hour, students will
be notiﬁed of this fact through the
bulletin boards.

Aside from Dr. Wagner's talk at
the regular pep assembly during the

structure from the belfry for which
it was originally, designed to an ob-
bervation and reception room. is be“
ing made, according to John Weber,
chief engineer of the University. If
present ideas on the subject are car-
ried through, the height of the Ca-
thedral will be increased by four and
one-half feet over the present height,
about 495 feet.

. The plans for the top floor orig-

Liiially included an open room intend-
ed tohouse a— carillon of bells. In-
steadgit will become now a glass-
enclosed observation parlor from
which _a superb view of the surround-
in; city may be obtained by the
sight-seer. The increased height of
the whole building will come from
raising of the roofvof this room. It
will in no way change the propor-

  Of Fatigue

Tests On 160

By ‘MARGARET REINHERR

_ . Take a course in sleeping? The proﬁcient backrow _dozer may smile
knowingly; the breathless activity hound may sigh for time to get 1t_1n;
the freshmen may puzzle, “Is it required?” All of them have something
to ‘learn about the least discussed part of the day's work, although no
University includes a. department of sleep in its curriculum.

 I Dr. H. M. Johnson, head of the Simmons Investigation at Mellon In-
stitute, is constantly bringing new facts about the. way we spend a. third
ofvour lives to the public. About a hundred and sixty subjects, including
some thirty college men, have been observed so far. ~

“Noise and light have little effect on
sleep. Studies of deaf and dumb

Sal; deterioration, is something which
{should not be bragged about, but
rather kept to oneself, and‘ gotten
d, of as quietly and as expeditious-
as possible. The effects of alcohol
cﬁﬂl be produced by some degree of
fsitirgue; both_ conditions are physi-
ologically equivalent. Thus anyone
"who. has the right arnount_o_f work
need not turn to hquid imbibing for

~ .130 yo-u regard sleep as a _ waste
1o-,£rtime”? Although motility is sup-
pressed, certain other vital activi-
‘tisg. .-are maintained, and some are
' tensiﬁed. The process of manufac-

iaccolmpanying excretion of poison-
-ous waste-products requires time
just as other work does. Since no
substitute for_ sleep has yet been
discovered, “hitting the hay” for
seven or eight hours a night remains
the most efficient way for a college
student or any other individual to
keep his job.

“ } Separate Rooms Unnecessary

. Nor need the dormitory dweller
fret about sleeping conditions. Dr.

rooms are unnecessary unless’-and
lhere lies the catch—-one person is
noisy ' when asleep, or unless he
-walks about or talks while others
are attempting to sleep. But that
brings a problem of fraternity disci-
pline which remains to be investi-
ated.

_er‘s.onality who has, through his di-
rection, cleared up so many of the
mysteries in which sleep is wrapped,

describes himself as a robust, in-
‘tense, but ﬁtful worker. He adds the
_ early universal trait of every
ealthy individual: “I am very ami-
able iiidisposition as long as not
 terfered with.” Dancing cards,
mmplng and swimming are is con-
entional diversions, .but he includes
liking for working out rhymes and
eyhgs for young children among the
st; of his avocatioiis. His chief de-
ght. however, is associating with

The 1931 class -of the Research
Bureau for Retail Training is almost
an international“ group. Thirteen
students from the United States, one
from British Columbia and o_ne from
England» were chosen to-begin study
from among over 300 applicants.

In compliance, with a prerequisite
for entry,‘the young men and wom-

stipulated period of selling experi-
ence in department stores. The class
is now studying theory in organiza-
tion and management which is sup-
plemented by one day a week in la -
oratory work in the stores, prepara-
tory to later department’ ‘routine
work..As before, the students will
spend the month of December in
Pittsburgh stores in junior executive
positions; and during some parts of
May will work as research assistants
on store problems in Pittsburgh
stores.

Students will thus have the oppor-
tunity to become acquainted with de-

artment store routines, policies,.ac—
ivitiesand problems at close range.
- A weekly
ence on retail trends is now held at
the Bureau, and students conduct its
alternate meetings in the form of
department store staff meetings.

Pitt’s Most Pampered Male
Monopolizes Coeds’ Time

 

Although the rules and by-laws
of the University describe Heine
House as the center of women's
campus activities, for four years a
member of the male species has
dominated its functions. Threats of
eviction have failed to dismay him
-—-well, he knows his place is se-
cure.

Annually, Jerry’s stacatto greet-
ing welcomes the women of the
class to become his
friends. He is a veritable gold-
digger, nay even a glutton, for she
who feeds him most receiveshis ar-
dent attentionvand puppy love. An
offering of crackers is gratefully ac-
cepted, but hear ye, maidens, the
true way to his heart is anever
ceasing supply of chocolates.

The dean’s luncheon, the sand-
wiches for the senior tea, the pota-
toes that are to be baked by one
o’clock, all these must wait until
Jerry has been served his lunch. He
is master of the household. Poor
females can only stand and wait.

Great Lover
A great loverand believer in the

ﬁrm traditions of the home is this

male. Rarely does he stray to more '

exciting haunts; poker holds no
charm for him. Only one thing can
draw him from the porch. If ever

a cat dares come near his domain,
Jerry dashes forth in a seething
fury, startles the air with
expressions, and then glares into
the tree with an “I-d*are-you-to-
come-down” leer on his face. One
hour-and hour and a ha-If-—-two
hours-_-—at last he retreats and the
Call. like Goldilocks, runs off never
to return again.

More ‘popular. than the fairest
bfille/he_1s, in truth, a campus cel-eb-
1‘1ty- His full name? Why, Jerry,
only Jerry———for Jerry is a dog.

of No. 2 Frick Acres. It belongs
to the family Loonyitis from which
come such other species as baseball-
étis, tennisitis and even footballi-
is.

This particular bug was original-
1; found in the Gaelic wastes of

cotland and points north, and
brought to this country by such
ardent scientists as Walter Hagen,
Bobby Jones and our own Profes-
sor McKinlei . The Loonyitis Golfo-
poda McKin eyensis, although a na-
tive of Scotland, has bred so well
in this country, that its ardent pur-
suers have recognized it as a pure-
ly American bug, malady or what
have you. It is for this especial
reason, therefore, that the local
bug was named Golfopoda McKin-
leyensis. Its ardent pursuers may
be seen in their search for. the bug
on the verdant slopes of the Schen-
ley course, attired in their charac-

nized as striped socks, ﬂowing plus‘

again. and againlshowvn the public how to use
new products of the telephone laboratory,
and how to make new uses of existing

In short telephony is a buiiness, with prob-

Closing) an int\_nsive membership
week wit approximately 300 women
on its roll, Y. W. C. A. hopes to top
the 400 mark before the close of

the year._ Although the annual
membership banquet last Friday
oﬂicially cosed the campaign, new

members are being enrolled during
the whole year. According to Mac
O'Donnell,.membership chairman, the
short campai of ﬁve da s this
year has rep aced the regu ar two
weeks’ drive of other years, but the
shorter period has proven compare.
tively more successful. «
Upper Classes Lead

So far, the ﬁles show the upper-
"class women slightly in the lead.
the freshmen making u only 125
of the 300 on the roll. f the fresh-
man group, eighty women became
members of Freshman Why Club
which held its first social meetinlg
yesterday during a luncheon. Aleet
Roberts, Col. '32, Y. W. C. A. Why
Club chairman, headed the general
discussion of the club's plans for the
year‘, in co-operation with the new
program of W. S. G. A. Wh Club
will not elect officers imme lately,
but plans to function through sev-
eral well organized committees with-

ter of slight importance, as she steps
gingerly upon Doctor‘ Shepard’s
popular scale. She may say other
words besides “omigod"—-in fact
she may actually imprecate if the
matter is weighty enough. It often
is. In extreme cases, she- may even
doubt the accuracy of the Doctor's
seal but such 8.. thing is foolish and
usua ly done outof-pure malice; for
it is common knowledge that of all
scales in the world’ Dr. Shephard’s
is the most accurate. And the most
used. At all hours of the day, lines
of pros ctive patrons are to be
found c uttering up the tiny office
where the scale is located. It is esti-
matedlthat on_ an average of 564
coeds make use of the scale daily.
This make a total of. 1,031,350 a
year, and in ten years it would be
ten times as many. Think of the
possibilities of a little graft. A
penny a weigh, for instance.

Monday she was wearing a dar
blue twill with collar and cuffs of

an orchid one-piece dress, knitted

blue ﬂannel with insets of plaid and
beret to match, inset-s and all. Even

Our Snooper No. X_ told us a long
tale about Fred Lucas and Bob
Kleeb at Cleveland, (they were the
only two boys who paid to get in,
and how they paid). It seems that
Bob and Fred met a very charming
frail who needed to get to the sta-
dium and couldn't ﬁnd the way. And
our brave men of Pitt took it upon
themselves to ﬁnd the way for her.
Ah, fatal day! The young lady
hadn't bought her ticket to the game
yet and so what could any man do?
Well, she was lovely and they paid.
They came back broker but wier
men and had to bum a place to sleep
from Chick Kenny when poor old
Chick didn't know where he was go-

Howdy, folkses! Remember last
week I said something about Doug
Mansﬁeld . . . well here's something
else about Doug that Y011 might like
to know. Of course you all still
remember, too, that he is a transfer
here from Brown and at Brown he
became a friend of Ethel Barry-
more’s son whose name isn*t Barry-
more but Colt. So when Ethel came
to town Douglas who is a friend of
hers too had dinner with her. Now
for somebody who can't even afford
the money to see the great Barry-
more from a balcony, I _have_ an
utmost respect, mebbe a little 1631‘
ousy, for the boy with all the ma-
chines. And talkin about a bunch
of transportation, I’l bet everybody

1; doesn't know Herbie Burchnell who

went to Cornell once. He has about
three different kinds of roadsters
and lives in the Hotel Schcnley all
year 'round. With his family, of a
certainment. And I wouldn’_t be so
surprised if Herbie’s n-ame is men-

tioned in the Blue Book of Pitts-

burgh.

...o——

Geraldine Alter. the freshman
with all the red hair, drives the best
looking car out of school. About
100 cylinders and long and blue.
Baby is it keen! And the last about
transfers--have you seen Emmy
Lou Holler the new transfer from
Swarthmore. Not half bad.

.._.o......

Mildred Wakeﬁeld, _, the College
Humor Hall of Fame and Beauty
girl, looks for all the world like a
female Paul Revere these days.
With a tri-cornered hat and a. caped
coat, I expect to see her ga10P
madly out of Alumni Hall when the
bells ring‘.

The two littlest and youngest
looking freshmen at school today
are Ruby Schrecengat and Morris
Cohen's little brother. At first I
thought they were visiting with
their grown-up sisters or brothers,
but they really attend. Young Mr.
Cohen who looks about ten is play-
ing basketball too.

....o.....

Bob Kleeb’s eyes aren't really one
color at all. They change color
with the k-ind of ties he wears. Blue,
green and gray. Bob says they_are

reen most of the time, and since

e looks well in green anyway, that
might be the real reason.

.._.o——

’Tis rumored that the genial, ever
pen-pushing Bill Morrell, broad-
caster of ye University news will
leave shortly to study-—in Europe,
we hear.

-—o— _

I really believed myself last
week when I said no more he or she
stuff, but I got this veriﬁed and
double veriﬁed and I think it de-
serves the Honor Spot. it IS all
about James McAffee and Elinor
Smith. And it started last spring
at 9. Gwen dance where they met.
And then along through the spring,
summer, the moon and the music
and the vacation helped things
along, and so last week-end the en-
gagement of Elinor Smith to James
McAffee was announced. And I wish
them lots of luck. Of course there
won't be any wedding bells until

ﬁnished school. But they deserve
the honor spat today because I have
a. strange notion that love, even col-
legiate love, is rather beautiful. And
in 1933 they will deserve the honor
spot again, maybe more than today,
if they still ‘are in love, And hon-
estly, kids, Jim and Elinor, I hope
you make a. go of it and have loads
of luck and everything and maybe I
will write up the wedding. So -three
cheers and good wishes for the
young couple for always and al-
ways. Sllonug for tod-ay.

Men’s Frats
Pledge 64

Biddle Reports Successful
End Of Fall Rushing

 

The twenty-two men's social fra-
ternities of the University experi-
enced one of they most successful
early fall rushing seasons in the past
ﬁve years, pledging 64 men by last
Tuesday evening, according to Theo-
dore Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men in charge of rushing. _

Figures as released Wednesday
morning by Biddle showed that 64
men had been pledged, seven had re-
fused bids, and‘ eight were unpre-

ared to pledge at the present time.

n addition to these, 26 men had not
yet re orted in answer to bids await-
mg i: em, and 11 others signified
their intention of reaching a decision
within the‘ next week.

Because of the altered rushing

rules which permitted any upper-
classman "or second semester fresh-
man to pledge without regard to his
scholastic standing, the past rushing
season was- carried on intensively by
the various houses with a round of
Smokers. dances and theater parties
being extended to the rushees.
. None of the rushees pledged dur-
ing. the past two weeks will be per-
mitted to be initiated until he shall
have passed 12_ quality points in the
previous semester.

With the early fall rushing out of
the. way, fraternity men are now
laying campaigns for the rushing of
freshmen, scheduled to get under

Bits About

PITT

Editorial (Don’t be Scared)

The fact that so many students
ﬁnd the time to rest in rustic com-
fort, out on the lawns on either
side of Alumni Hall drive these
balmy Fall days, brings to mind
again the "need for an outdoor
campus retreat for men. Why not
temporarily place a few park
benches and weather proof chairs
out on the esplanade in front of
Alumni Hall, where students might
sit and sun themselves as they gaze
out over the civic splendors of Oak-
land and the distant sylvan slopes
of Schenley Park? Perhaps, in the
future, a permanent terrace and
walk might be built, with a classic
balustrade upon which lazy students
could prop their feet. The women,
of course, have Heinz House porch,
and it is the success of this ren-
dezvous that has fostered the idea
of the Alumni Hall terrace. Please,
now, couldn't _a few inexpensive
benches and chairs be found very
soon?

.....o_.
Probably the only indication as
yet of s rapidly approaching Hal-
Iawe’en on the Pitt campus is the
announcement of a timely Hallowe’en
Dance being materialized by the
Student Loan Association on All
Saints Night,’October 31, in Web-
ster Hall. Fee, $2.00 or thereabouts.
You’re welcome, Sunny.

._.0_.. '

You don't have to agree if you
don’t wanna, but to our mind the
biggest improvement on the campus
since the Cathedral of Learning, is
the new uniform of the R.0.T.C. All
in favor, stand at attention and pre-

sent laurel wreaths to Colonel
Cullen.

._.o._.
The University gardeners have

two ways of removing the drifts of
fallen leaves that clutter up the
grounds. ’ They either drive them
along the grass into=a heap with a
strong spray of water from a hose,
or else just take them up with a
rake. Simple, isn't it, when you
know how?

..._o_..

Activitymen are sort of glad that
the leaves around the Activities
buildin haven't been removed as
yet. he thick carpet of crackling
lea'ves'is easier on the feet than the
bare cinders.

._..o_._

With - the steamshovel making
rapid progres in the backyard, the
new addidtion to the Historical So-
ciety" of Western Pennsylvania's
building alongside the Twentieth
Century Club on Bigelow Boulevard
should prove a welcome and bean-
tifying improvement near Pitt“

By the way, the lone pennant still
decorating the walls of the Hustle
(Activity) Hut is from Cornell. Why

- Cornell should be neglected beyond

all others, we do -not ‘know unless it
is because this pennant is right
above the door of the Musical Or-
ganizations’ room, _and so, sacred.

You played a pretty little game,
my dear, .

I suppose it was enjoyed?

Sighs and pretty talk whispered
into my ear

Enthralled me; while you toyed.

Remember, when we parted, how
you clung,

Arms about my neck, and softly
swore

That in me alone your future hung,
That you were mine for evermore?

And remember too that there's no
use in ﬁghting,
For you don’t have my silly stuﬂ in
u-riting.

——Valder Vinzchel.

The way the Carnegie Tech team
‘marched through Georgia makes us
a little fearful of the city champion-
ship. As a motto for the Tartan-
Panther game we suggest—“Check
and Double Tech.”

In Alumni Hall -yesterday we
heard two Frosh arguing; a boy and
a charming girl. “G’wan,” says he,
And
angrily and smartly she replied,
“Yes and yours would make a clock
run.”

You’uns guys what thinks we ain’t

“I'm 2. tele~graplier,”-he said,

“Oh,” we replied wisely,

“Just a mere Telegraph Pole."

 

Infrequently does Pittpourri be-
come serious, but today we must
speak of something seriously. The
Student Loan, an organization that
does beneﬁt all needy students, is
holding a dance at Webster Hall,
October 31st. The proﬁts are to be
used to further the Student Loan
cause. Miss Virginia Wickersham is
the chairman and tickets may be
purchased through her. We advise
everyone to go. And incidentally, all
"you little boys and girls who would
like to put arsenic in our coffee will
have a chance to do so at this dance.
The Gods willing, and Miss. Wicker-
sham willing, your playmate will
escort the chairman.

 

Another hoiden ‘wrote us a letter
and inquiries if it is true_tha.ti all
full blooded Indians walk in single

Well, Gwenn, to the best of our
knowledge we answer affirmatively.
At least that was the way the one
was walking that we saw.

 

Marty Fallon the whimsical Cap
and Gowner with the recalcitrant
Titian hair has the strangest cus-
tom we know. Although Marty is a
Senior, each Wednesday he wears a
black freshman tie to school. The
other days of the week his neck is
draped with blatant yellows, pur-
ples, and azures. When asked why
he insists on such a fad, Marty is
taciturn, but after some cajoling he
becomes talkative. The real reason
we discovered is this. Marty looks
around and sees so many freshmen
who are equally intelligent as him-
self being forced to wear black ties.
And so out of humility he sacriﬁces
one day of the week when he comes
as one of the Sheep and Goats.

 

Jack Morley was sitting alone in
the Panther office one night last
week sketching. Due to interrup-
tions even at 10:00 at night which
are characteristic to the Activities
building, he had'locked himself in,
and being absorbed in. his work did
not hear the knocking at the door.
After a while a rustling on the roof
interrupted him, but he passed it off
as the tree blowing against the roof.
Then suddenly there came arolling,
a rumbling, on the roof and a foot
dangled before the windw. Then
the trunk, chest and arms and ﬁnally
the tar-paper blackened face of
Freshman Alexander MacLachlan, a
Weekly and Panther aspirant. He
giggled and said sillily, “I brought

Lines read over a freshman’s
shoulder in lecture class: Koku and
Eradicate stood speechless with as-
tonishment, and 'I‘om Swift the tal-
ented young inventor looked at Ned
Newton his ﬁnancial manager with a
quizzical smile.

We arrived home yesterday and
mother had purchased a new vacuum
sweeper, “Hurray,” we cried, “ a new
sweeper, Eureka.” “Nay son,” she
said, “Hoover.”

The Young Women’s Christian
Association is on the campus at the
University of Pittsburgh for a very
good reason. Nearly every spring

for twenty years, a group of wom-
en students have decided that the
spiritual should have an avenue of
expression in their campus life.
They wanted life that isn’t found

ning. These men, who shot their
opinions at one another, held forth:
as sharply and loudly as machine
guns. In spite of themselves, it].
seems, they condemned the other!
side of their “debate” without the’

formality of having heard it. 

Inside the Hall, three of the speak-
ers complimented the assembled
crowd on the existence of Tolerance
in their hearts. To be present at
such a four-square recital of con-
flicting ideas was held up as a proof
that the Spirit of Tolerance was, in-
deed, abroad in the land. The re-

—maining speaker prefaced his re-

marks by the statement that there
never has been an audience which
was both large and intelligent. “This
audience is large,” he added. Surely
intelligence is necessary to any feel-
ing of Tolerance. Intelligence, how-
ever, is no guarantee of tolerant at-
titudes. University ‘students (who
might be supposed to beneﬁt by what
is considered the superior advantage
of an Education) are as prejudiced
and intolerant, ordinarily, as are the
people with little or no learning.
Don't get excited. We are not ob-,
noxiously Intolerant of the accepted‘
Big Things of life—-just mildly so. It
is in the little things, the not-eternal
versities, that we fail so unfortu-
nately -to show the balance which
should be found in the educated
mind. We make “blanket” s-tate-
ments. iWe say that an idea is “im-
possible”; that we can never believe
it. We say proudly, “Believe me, I
don't change my mind so easily. I
think so now. I think you’re abso-
lutely Wrong, and I'll still think so
twenty years from now.” And do
you know, it may be that twenty
years from now we may be so static
as to “still think so.”

 

This is the fourth week of school,
the fourth week of student life in
the noisy, crazy-quilt, fascinating

environment of a great industrial’

city. We have, in one month, again

become part of the

THE CITY a s s e d efficiency.

Unless I am even
more than, usually mistaken, we
have no time for leisure, no time for
idling, no time for October sunlight,
which falls as delicately as leaves.
We are too Busy, of course. There
are many parts of our daily puzzle
which are almost too difficult to

piece togetlier. How pleasant it,

would be if we could spend—even
mentally, or spiritually, whatever
that is-—A Month in the Country. If
you saw Alla Nazimova in Tur-
genev’s play, you are probably em-
anating superlatives . . . glamorous
. . .subtle. . .intense. A Month in the
Country, we are taken to that far
land where emotion ﬂashes and fades
like green summer lightning. Tur-
genev lets you, almost compels you,
to live for so short a time in the
glow and charm of lives which drift,
which spin themselves out with none
of the abortive insistence on contin-
ual Action to which we are so ac-
customed. Even over the tangled
emotions of the excitable gwoinan

whom Nazimov-a portrayed there lay

vgenius of the organization, a volun-

.ness to the true, the good and the

in the abundance of things. In
their decision is found the very

tary group with a desire for life.
And what is this full and cneative
life that the members of the Y. W.
C. A. seek? To experience it is to
know. It includes poise and peace,
“not that calm which many feign,
and call that peace which is a dearth
of pain.” It means the integration
of personality, a growing sensitive-

beautiful—growth toward God with
joyous freedom. It means a satis-K
factory adjustment to the Spirit of 5
the Universe and a consequent in-'
flow of resource for the solution of
problems. Brieﬂy, there is harmony
between two harmonies.

And how do we ﬁnd Life? Doesn’t
the scientist in the laboratory give
us a cue as to logical procedure?
He assumes the existence of truth
beyond that which he knows. He
eliminates the personal equation as
far as possible and in so far as it
affects the validity of results. He
explores available and relevant
facts. He ﬁnds truth. As we face

,facts of human

situations in life, we assume God,

ourselves of the personal e uation,

‘Panthers’. Have Easy Time
With Western Reserve

 

Running their string of consecu-
tive victories out to three games, the
Golden Panthers easily defeated the
weak Western‘ Reserve team of
Cleveland in a warmup game by a
score of 52-0, thereby duplicating

the score of an earliervictory over -

Waynesburg. . -~

Although minus MacMurdo, Clark
and Daugherty, the Panthers gained
at will through the weak Reserve
line and easily broke up the offensive
thrusts of the Red Cats. The small
crowd in attendance received the

reatest of thrills when Captain

ddie Baker ran back the opening
kick-off the length of —the'ﬁeld for a
touchdown. ‘ - ~

Once again Coach Sutherland
cleared the bench of all subs and for
the third straight week the entire
squad saw action. V

The highly touted Pitt backﬁeld

« broke into the limelight once more

by their long, brilliant runs through

occasion for trick plays, the Panth-

Pitt authorities will break a long‘-

when they permit the broadcasting
of the Pitt-Notre Dame football

has been so keen that the Pitt au-

would also be broadcasted were

‘Pitt Frosh

Face Plebes
At Stadium

Both Yea_rl-ii-ig Teams
Have Clean Slates
To Date

In the Pitt Stadium tomorrow
afternoon the Pitt and Carnegie
Tech freshmen clash in what
promises to be one of the hardest
fought games of the year for either
team. Since "there are no other
collegiate football games in Pitts-
burgh. tomorrow, more than twenty
thousand followers of football are
expected to turn out and watch the
future stars of the Pitt and Tech
ridiron. -
To date the Carn ie Tech fresh-
men have participa in two games,
while Coach “Skip” Gougler’s men
have only been in one contest. This
gives the Scotchmen a slight edge
over the Pjttites. Tech has defeated
Kiski, one of the strongest prep
teams in the country, and the Wash-
Jeff freshmen, while the Panther
freshmen have defeated the George
Washington freshmen.

Tesser Star-

Some of the boys that are out-
standing for the Tech Plebes are
Tesser, former Meadville fullback;
Stewart, K.iski’s star end last year,
and Dreshar, an end who is a brother
of John Dreshar, Carnegie Tech's
present All-American guard. _Tes-
ser has starred in both games for
the Plebes, ripping the opposing
lines to shreds.

The boys who have_been doing
well for the Panther frosh are
Skladaney, an end; Love, tackle;
Matesic, fullback, and Sebastian,
halfback. As an added attraction to
the game, there is the‘ rivalry be-
tween Hogan, Pitt signal barker,
and Tesser, Tech fullback, who are
traditional rivals from high school

ays.

Last. Saturday night the Pitt
freshman football team journeyed to
Washington to take over the strong
George Washington freshmen from
that place-by a nineteen to six count.

Score Early

The Pitt freshmen made all of
their scores in the first half, while
the -Washingtoanians made their
score in the third quarter. Coach-
Goug_ler'started Timmtns and Sklad-I
aney at the ends, Love and Mere"-‘
ditli at the tackles, Onder and Hart-
wig at the guards, G"elini at the
pivot berth, Hogan at quarter,
Simms and Sebastian at the halves
and Matesic at full.

The biggest thrill of the game was
provided when Sebastian went
around left end for eighty yards and
a touchdown. The other two touch-
downs b Pitt were made using
straight ootball tactics, with Sebas-
tian, Simms and Matesic alternating
carrying the ball. Matesic went over
for the touclidownfboth times. The
George Washington team’s lone‘
scorecame -when they started a drive
‘ﬁom“\midﬁeld -and pushed the ball
over the last stripe. . .

All the Pitt freshman substitutes
broke into the game and gave a good
account of themselves, especially
Vincent, Sioux City boy, and Craft.
The subs all showed promise and the
ﬁrst team boys will have to work
hard if they want to keep their
positions.

Corr ‘Predicts Good «

V Year For Swimmers
“Barring accidents. and sickness,
we should have a good team,” was
the comment of Coach Pat Corr on
the varsity swimming team. “We are
shy of reserves but with the avail-
able material we» should have .a suc-
cessful year.” The varsity has lost
only two men from last year’s team,
but the new sophomores "are" more
than able to ﬁll the gaps,

“The freshmen willshow plenty of
strength,” Coach Corrcontinued. “At
present there are ,more,than enough
to comprise a squad, and‘tho mate-
rial is fairly_good.- -I feel-sure that
there are several stars among them.”

For the time being each man goes
through the same routine, swimming
100 yards, kickinga length, swim‘-
ming 50 widths, and kicking for a
ﬁve minute period. This program
varies daily under the direction of
Coach Corr. Every swimmer is
timed daily so that progress can be
noted and so that Coach Corr can
watch the form of each man. while
he is in the water. '

As yet no swimmer has been al-
lowed ‘to practice in the event he
wishes to ‘try for. Only the diver-
siﬁed training of all the swimmers.
has been followed. A schedule has
not been arranged as yet.

seven to no ing score. In this
game the New Yorkers put up a
high grade of football which bodes
a none too good omen for the Suth-
erland team. This is Syracuse's
third straight victory without a de-
feat, and..as the Panthers have also
won three without a loss, one of the
undefeated and untied teams will
have their clean slate marred and
their chances for the Eastern title
ruined. Panther fans seem to be
taking this game lightly, but the
players themselves are taking it
seriously,Vas Pitt Scouts who saw the
Orange in action last week say that
they have a‘ powerful running at-
tack and ‘a’ good defense.
‘ ' Irish Win

The Rocknian Ramblers who are
to meet a week from tomorrow, de-
feated astrong Navy team by a
twenty-six to _two count. Every
man on the Notre Dame bench got
into the game and the third and
fourth teams outplayed the. sailor
boys from Annapolis. The saying is
-that no team is stronger: than its re-
serves and from what was mentioned
before about the Irish-reserves, it
can be seen that the Panthers are
in. for a realbattle when the Notre
Dame team comes to Pittsburgh.

The dark skinned Joe Savoldi,
Notre Dame's All-American bid for
a fullback berth, has been running
wild in all the 8,3-.m.8;S played to date.
It can be seen frointbis that if Pitt
wants to take the boys from South
Bend that Joe «Savoldi will have to
be stopped. And that is a tough
proposition for any team as other
teams will testify. .

On November 1 Pitt meets Nebras-
ka‘, which was defeated last Satur-
day by Oklahoma. As a result of
this defeat, Danna X. Bible, Nebras-
ka coach,.has been driving his boys
hard to"'get ‘them in a ﬁghting mood
whenjthey-meet Pitt, as this is one
of their biggest games of the year.

"Ohio Snowed Under

Ohio- State was the other Pitt

opponent to be defeated. They were
snowed under by Northwestern, tak-
ingthe short end of a‘ nineteen to
two score. Their line lost so many
regulars from last year that it is not
up to standard, but with a. little
more seasoning is expected to get
better. Wesley Fesler, All-Ameri-
can end from last year, is being used
at the fullback berth this year.
V The Tartans from the other side
of the hill walloped a good Georgia
Tech team by a thirty-one to noth-
ing score.-Alexander, Georgia Tech's
coach, says that Carnegie has one of
the strongest teams in the coun .
So thatﬂis suﬁicient to say there is
going to-‘be one sweet“ battle when
Pitt and; Tech get ,together in the
stadium. '

Penn State which is to be met Tur-
key day defeated Marshall, a small
college team, by a sixty_-ﬁve to noth-
ing score. Nothing much can be
learned about State fromthis game
but if they are not any stronger than
in preceding years, verylittle oppo-
sition can be expected from them.

Planned Play - V

Captain Eddie Baker sure did
somenice running with the ball
‘against Reserve. You should have
seen Eddie with his headlong run-
ning, fooling those Clevelandersl on
that ninet -seven yard run from the
kickoff. was telling Eddie before
the game started that if he got the
kickoff to dash straight ahead, as

.1

the Reserve boys would ﬁgure that,

he was going to try to do some fancy
sidestepping. Everything came out
‘as I planned, and everything was
hotsy-totsy for Eddie’s getaway. Not
that I am trying to belittle Eddie,
but anybody can see that the run
was due to my headwork before the

game. , .

All the boys that.played with me
on the freshman team’ seem to be
getting their collar bones and should-
ers out of whack. First me, when
Quatse fell, on me in scrimmage.
“Chuck” Tully is tellin‘ everybody
that it happened on a Sc enley Park
bench, but he is jealous of me
cause the women go for me in a big
way. “Tiger” Waltonwas the next
one to break his shoulder bone. As
you remember «he got hurt in the
West Virginia game. In the Reserve
game Rocco Cutri, ﬁrst string Re-
serve for the quarterback post, went
and did the same ‘thing. Who's next?
Me and “Jock” have enough worries
without these injuries coming along.

Syracuse Next

We meet Syracuse tomorrow, and
according to advance reports these
New Yawkers are plenty tough.
We’ll have to be on our toes all the
time to take these boys over. I don‘_t

Tartans Eager To Avenge
lLast   Year’s Grid  éat 

Vny SNOOPEB NUMBER nova N

 

Lastlvsaturday, owing to a queer

exlgency of fate, we found ourselves;

in possession of tickets entitling
their‘ bearers to seats in the Car-
negie rooting section at the Carnegie
Tech-Georgia Tech game. We were
the only Pitt men aside’ from Suth-
erLand’s scouts, we could detect in
the. whole Stadium. .
The tickets we found in a little
irl's--handbag, but we won't go into
t at justnow, not wanting to spend
this semester in the Oakland police
station or an other bastile. From
bitter experience, we know that
Pittsburgh has a good jail; there’:
no tting away from it. -
ﬁll, be that as it may be, we Pitt
men; took our courage in our hands
andiitook ’the-seats the Boy Scout
as ed us. We felt like Da.nie1*in'
the: ion’s Den. Loyal Tartans sur-
rounded us on ever hand, a shin-
ing’ sea of faces. An they all looked
pretty tough and healthy, too. We
felt a little weak ourselves. Under
our breaths, we kept telling one an-
other not tmstart a: good old “A1le-
gheneo-Genac-_Genac,” when the
cheerleaders waved their arms. Prob-
ably, if we had 'ven vent to a few
Pitt cheers, no ody would have
known’ it anyway, because the Tech
rooters made some very loud noises
whenever their yell leaders asked
them to do so.
Tartans Yodelists

So we just kept quiet and let the
Skibos t laryngitis. They have a
locomot ve yell that has more snap
and, power than Pittls, and their
cheerleaders are _ better at getting
peliifroni the cheering section by
a rig it up than the Pitt yodel-

While the eleven Tartans out on
the gridiron were using the Georgia
Tech,Tornado to clean the dust out
of their jerseys, the Tartans in the
stands kept" up. a running ﬁre of
chatter. Every time Eyth ripped off
a long ain ., somebody would re-
mark: “ h, boy, won't it be wonder-
ful. when he gets loose against Pitt!”
Or ma be: “Pitt is goin to look sad
when arcis hits —’em t isyear!”

One. thou ht especially seemed to
beuniversa among the Tech men,
“Tech must beat Pitt worse than
Pittbeat Tech last year." That 34-13
setback "the Panthers handed the

Tartans still rankles, at 1east.am.ong'
the students. ‘ ‘ ' '
Irish Not Mentioned

Despite the fact that Carnegie is
scheduled to pla Notre Dame this
Saturday, immediately followin the
Georgia Tech game, not a war was-
spoken about the prospects for this
game, only about the coming Pitt-
Tech battle. Without a doubt, Tech
men hope that they will get a com-
plete revenge by this struggle. And
what is more. it is rumored that
Carnegie students will get a four-
day complete leave from their
classes if Tech beats Pitt. '

Oh, it was no wonder that we felt
a triﬂe uneasy in the midst of so
much hostile school spirit. One thing
we were convinced of, Tech is going
to support the Tech_ football "team
to the limit.'We noticed one new
thing on the ﬁeld, a small ‘white
horse with a small Tartan on his
back. I guess the Panther isgoing
to have a Tech" mascot to play with;

Changes Made

Under New Order Frosh May
Specialize In One Sport

 

Physical Education will introduce an
entirely new system in the physical
recreation of Freshman men.
Previously, it was compulsory for
all “fresh” men to participate in ev-
ery branch of sport offered in the
ﬁrst year curriculum. This year,
each member of the Class of Thirty-
four will have the option of special-
izing in one sport of his choice, in-
stead of being compelled to take
several that do not interest him.

ketball, tennis, golf, boxing, wres-
tling, soccer, touchfootball, diving,
Red Cross life saving, horseshoe
pitchin , tumbling, hockey, archery,
handba l, and mushball. If there are
enough students who wish to sign
up for sports not mentioned, the e-
partment will endeavor to make up
classes for those few.

This system will give every fresh-
man a chance to become proﬁcient in
one sport, instead of getting a smat-
tering of each one.

Without a doubt, Pitt will be one
of the first universities in the coun-
try to introduce specialization in
freshman physical recreation.

Syracuse Schedules
Pitt As Homecoming

The Pitt-Syracuse game tomorrow
afternoon will be the main feature
of a ala alumni homecoming week-
end p anned by Syracuse University
for the 20,000 of her alumni who
are expected to attend, and the vis-
iting Pittsburghers.

After ‘the game an all-University
dance will be held in the men’s gym-
nasium of the University which
will be open to Pitt students who
stay for the week-end events.

Fraternities and sororities on the
Syracuse campus will hold open
house for everyone, visitors and
homecomin alumni alike, making
the three ays a continuous round
of entertainment. .

The visiting Syracuse alumni will
attend the regular Friday classes, a
recreational program, featuring a
golf tournament and various ﬁeld
events, and in the afternoon will be
permitted to wa.tch/ the ﬁnal work-
out of ‘the Syracuse squad before

‘ the Pitt game.

Looking Them Over
with the  

CAMPUS SCOUT

Before we go into convulsions congratulating ourselves on the close-
ness with which we guessed the score for the Pitt-Western Reserve game
last Saturday, we would like our readers to know that Charley Hyatt, All-
American basketball forward for the Panthers for the past three years,
dropped into the office last Friday for a. little gab fest.

Charley asked us to thank the Pitt fans, the Pitt officials, the coaches,
the students, and the downtown sports writers for the wonderful way in
which they treated him during the three years in which he represented the
Panthers on the cage floor.

0

Charley did not re-enter Pitt as he was expected to do this year,

but he left early this week for California where he will settle down

to the daily grind of earning a living. I asked Charley whether he In-

 tended to play professional basketball this winter but he replied in
the negative.

Personally, I feel that Charley has adopted a very wise_l)lan in
settling down to a business career instead of trying to earn his bread
and butter as a professional athlete. Red Grange tried to do that trick
but his ventures, which at ﬁrst proved successful ﬁnancially, have not
appealed much to the sucker public and Red now divides his time be-
tvlveen the duties as a night club m. c., an iceman, and a pro football
p ayer.

 

.__.._...o.__.._.

We are taking this opportunity to say good-bye to Charley and to
wish him good luck. As a blessing, may all your kids be as good basket-
ball players as yourself and for gosh sakes be sure and send them to Pitt.
So long, Charley. _

.And now to get back to football, your scout guessed the Pitt-Western
Reserve score to be 47-0 while the ﬁnal result proved to be 52-0, just ﬁve
points off. And J. Leonard Solomon, last year’s C. S. (Campus Scout), pre-
dicted that the score would be 21-0. Well, youth must be served even if
he has to order his own meals.

 

-———-o
For this week we olfer a 14-0 score with the Panthers on the long
end of the count. The Orangemen have been bragging that their line
-is the best defensive line in the country and most critics agree with
the Easterners on this point. I
Pitt followers, however, will tell you that no line in the country
is better than Jock Suthei-land’s line and past records bear out the
truth of this statement. Rarely, does a team score more than one or
two ﬁrst downs through the Pitt line, even in the even years when
Pitt has its weakest teams, weak for Pitt.

 

———-—o
The 1928 team which was considered weak by Pitt followers because
it lost two games and was tied in another, had only ﬁve ﬁrst downs chalked
up against its line, Carnegie scorin four and Washington and Jefferson
College the other one. And the sche ule that year was no cincn, either.
Aside from the two above mentioned schools, the Panthers encountered
Thiel, Bethany, Allegheny, West Virginia, Syracuse, Nebraska, and Penn
State that year. ‘
....._.__.o.——__

So if the Syracuse line expects to’ outplay the Panther line to-
morrow it will have to be an extraordinary line even though the Pan-
thers will enter the game with three of their regular linemen on the
bench. A Pitt team always ﬁghts hardest when the going is toughest

‘ and the team that faces the Orangemen tomorrow will be out to prove
the superiority of the Pitt line over the only team in the country hav-
ing a right to challenge them. . _

A writer for one of the larger newspaper syndicates ranks Pitt,
Carnegie Tech, Army, Syracuse, Notre Dame, Harvard, Colgate,
Northwestern, Wisconsin, Vanderbilt, Georgia, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Oklahoma, Kansas, University of Utah, and Washington
State as the leading teams of the country.

0 .

This list will be considerably decreased over the week-end as Carnegie
Tech faces Notre Dame, Pitt meets Syracuse, Army meets Harvard. This
will mean that at least three of’ these seventeen teams will be eliminated
from the national title race.

Some of the other schools will face opposition that should prove any-
thing but easy. Northwestern will face Indiana at Urbana; Wisconsin
faces Penn at Madison; Colgate faces Michigan State, which tied Michi-
gan, conquerors of Purdue, last year’s “Big Ten” champions; Tennessee
faces Alabama, Southern Conference champs for two successive years;
Oklahoma meets Texas U.; Kansas tangles with Bo McMillan’s Kansas
Aggies, and Utah opposes Brigham Young University at Salt Lake City.

 

o-———-— .
The list will decrease as the season wears along and by the mid-
dle _of November there will be but one or two teams with a valid claim
to national honors. Your scout and Mr. Maulsby, head of the journal-
ism department at Pitt, think that the national championship will be
decided here on November 8, when the Panthers tangle with the Tar-
tans in the Pitt stadium. ‘
If both teams are undefeated when they meet on that date, there
will hardly be any dispute as to who is the national champion. After
* that game, the Tartans will have only Temple and Washington-Jeib
erson to meet before ﬁnis is written to the season. Pitt will have
slightly tougher opposition to overcome but it should be victorious
over Ohio State and Penn State in its last two games of the season.

Leave Squad
Captain Wooldridge Shows
Ruggedness In Drills

By WILLARD NORTON.
Melnbew Frooh Swimming Squad

The varsity swimming squad still 5

remains the same while the frosh
squad has narrowed down to about
ten members. Jack Hanna, frosh cap-
tain last year, has been doing well
in practice and things can _be ex-
pected of. him this year. Fred Woold-
ridge, Reilly and Stoifan, have
been coming along in good Shape.

At the Monday practice, we start-
ed off by swimming 100 yards, and
then we swam sixty ards, starting
from the diving boar . The practice
was ﬁnished by kicking about thirty
widths of the pool, a distance of 300
yards. ‘

Tough Practice

Tuesday evening we started 01%’
with the usual 100 yards and 60
yards from the board. The big mo-
ment came when Pat Corr an-
nounced that we could swim ﬁfty
widths back-stroke, and then rest
and swim 50 widths free-style.
Wooldridge enjoyed this, but every
one is not rugged like Fred.

Stoﬁan has recently been appoint-
ed Coach of the Griper’s Club; the
boys can't go wrong with that nota-
ble at the helm. '

body adjourned, probabl a little
yviser and with apparent y no ill ef-
ects

‘Probably the keynote of the whole
discussion was sounded by John
terling, Eng. ’32, a junior member
of. the governin group when he
said “Council 2 ould be concerned
not so much with how it can per-
form legislation but in WHAT it
can do?” _

Decision to ask the administration
for a half holiday on the afternoon
of'November 14 to permit students
driving to Columbus for the Ohio
State football game to get an early
start.

: Pep Parade
In place of the bonﬁre pep assem-

bly on the eve of the‘Carnegie Tech
game, Council instructed the assem-
bly committee to make plans for a
return to the parade, which until
last year had been an annual fea-
ture of the football season. A foot-
ball holiday on the Monday follow-
ing the Tech me is also to be
asked for, the oliday to be granted
if the game is won by Pitt.
Unanimous approval was given to
the report of the committee on the
constitution for the proposed Men’s
Self-Governing Association, and ev-
ery indication that this measure
would be formally passed by Coun-
cil was given by Emanuel Fishkin,
Bus. Ad. ’31, chairman.
