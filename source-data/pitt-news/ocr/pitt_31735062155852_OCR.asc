SC committee on women cheer-
leaders has completed" a working
plan for the institution of the new
program, but there is some ques-
tion as to who should consider it
now. No one seems to know who
has final authority over. the cheer-
leader proposal.

The SC proposal refers to. the
recent “Balk” referendum and
the student support behind women
as cheerleaders. It begins, “Inas-
much as the students of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh have, by an
overwhelming majority, expressed
a desire to grant women of the
University an opportunity to be-
come cheerleaders, we of Student
Congress wish to propose a work-
able program for the introduction
of women cheerleaders into the
e_xtra—curricular activity program
of the University.”

The report recommends that
women cheerleaders be selected
in the same manner that men are.
This phase would be handled by
the Pitt Pistols, spirit-building
committee. The athletic depart-

Agency Trains Local Oﬂicials

Pitt Institu

BY JOAN THOMAS

Information on anything from
household units for garbage dis-
posal to wage tax problems has
been given to local government
oﬁlcials as far away as Johannes-
burg, South Africa by Pitt’s Insti-
tue of Local Government.

This agency, functioning on the
23rd ﬂoor, under the direction of
William G. Willis, was established
in 1944 by Elmer D. Graper, head
of Pitt’s political science depart-
ment. Preceded by Penn State and
the University of Pennsylvania,
Pitt’s Institute was ﬁnally estab-
lished after repeated requests by
municipal oﬁicials for such a pub-
lic agency. ‘ '

, The political-minded Mr. Willis‘
adds a professorship in political

science to his duties as Executive
Director of the Institute, regularly
teaching courses in “Municipal
Government and Administration”
and “Pennsylvania Local Govern-
ment” at the University.

Short on Time

In fact, he admits that “one of
my most difficult problems is to
control my time in such a way
that I can be of such service as
possible without spreading myself
so thin that I don’t do anything
well.”

The slim man hastened to ex-
plain that “spreading myself so
thin” was not intended as a pun.

This rapidly increasing agency,
hoping for an increased staff and
a better environment than the
crude brick-walled room now of-
fers, just graduated a class of 79
newly-elected oiﬁcials Feb. 3, ac-
quainting them with local govern-
ment procedures.

Aids New Borough

The Institute was really helpful
to the new Borough of Perry-
opolis, the Cinderella City. Mrs.
Mary Fuller Frazier, a former
resident, left the old township
$1,500,000.

It shortly became a borough and
all new ofﬁcials had to be elected.
The new men elected to the eleven

. posts were entirely green ‘in po-

litical affairs until they attended
the course on problems in local
government, conducted by a staff
of experts in each ﬁeld.

The graduates usually keep the
coveted diplomas under the glass
on their desk tops, certifying that
they are armed with the most
powerful weapon for better gov-
ernment—knowledge.

Governor John S. Fine pro-
claimed the Institute “one of the
most‘ important functions of the
University, which should be sup-
ported on a higher level than at
present.”

Clearing House

Occasionally the agency must
serve as a clearing house, referring

_ queries to others. This‘ is resorted

to only when the information can
not be found in the ample library
containing 6,000 books, pamphlets,
documents and monographs.

In addition to his many other
services, in 1950, Mr. Willis com-
pleted a book offered “as a con-
tribution to a broader understand-
ing of what it is that city govern-

ment does, and how it is organized
to do it.”

In spite of the Institute’s tre-
mendous output, he explained
that “one must live here” to see
how attitude, spirit, and state of
mind prevail . . . You can’t de-
scribe the Institute in terms of
service.”

feels that the place of women at
Pitt is not only in the classroom,
but on the athletic ﬁeld.” He con-
tinued, “SC offers this proposal as
a means to attain this desirable
objective.”

Women Would Increase Spirit

The committee expressed the
feeling that the proposal would in-
crease student spirit and enthusi-
asm and also provide another ac-
tivity for women.

But what happens now? To in-
sure the solidarity of the women's
83.2% vote, some authorities feel
that WSGA should vote its ap-
proval. If they do, what Univer-
sity authority would pass ﬁnal
judgement? Or would the matter
be placed with »a student-faculty

same purpose? _

The athletic department has
suggested that the plan be taken
directly to the administration.
Yet, the committee is not sure

which University officials should
handle it.

Two years ago, SC prexy Jack
Burwinkle, gleefully shouted,
“Women cheerleaders -by sum-

the proposal. Possibly this year,
with the high optimism, the long-
sought-after program will be ef-

“The mills -of the gods grind exceedingly slow,. but\.they“ grind
exceedingly ﬁne.”

Personally, we’re all for slow-grinding mills, but now
and then we. like to see something besides grist. The grist
in this case is the women cheerleader question, but the gods
of the administration have not seen ﬁt to either act on the
matter, or to allow the students to act.

This week Student Congress completed a working plan
to get women cheerleaders, but now that it’s passed no one
seems to know what to do with it. There is a feeling in
some quarters that WSGA should vote on the measure,
but WSGA completely ignored the issue at its last meeting
so it seems doubtful if they will vote on the SC plan. The
athletic department has_ suggested that the plan be taken
directly to the administration, but "neither the dean of men
nor the dean of women has offered to assume responsibili-
ty for either accepting or rejecting the plan.

Religion-In-Life Week Evidence .' . .

Any event such as Religion-In-

that . people feel can never be

ritual of one religious group
seems ostentacious to another;
the lack of same in the latter is

labeled heretical by the former.

What is forgotten in this con-
stant charge and counter-charge
is that personal faith is the im-
portant thing; more than exclu-
sive allegiance to one organized
church.

All men hold virtually the
same awe in their hearts. The
differences in the expression of
this feeling are merely differ-
ences in belief as to th means to
be used; not the end itself.

EDITOR,
PITT NEWS:

Your article- (“What of Relig-
ion-In—Life,” Wednesday, Feb.
24) quite good, but I believe that
you left the impression that local
chapters of social fraternities can
change their charters, which, as
you know, cannot be done in most
of them except by national con-

vention.

 

  

‘closely examined, one ﬁnds that

religion is life. Business, school-
ing, and socialactivities compose
only a small percentage of this’
life. Dr. Samuel Shoemaker
stated at the concluding dinner
Wednesday evening that people

_would find the going much

smoother _.if they would incorpor-
ate a little religion into these
and other aspects of their life.
Money vs. Religion

One of the primary objectives
of this university is to produce
men and women, not only with a
store of knowledge gained over
four years of study, but also with
a capacity and a desire to learn
more. The allinclusive topic, of
religion might very well be in-
cluded in this objective.

Of course, religion is an elec-
tive subject and no quality points
are acquired by its study. Fur-
ther-mpre, it is quite possible that
no immediate monitary gain will
be recognized" from this extra-

The worst dilemma is created

. when school administrations pro-

hibit any discriminatory pledging
practices locally, of course. This
has worked hardship upon sev-
eral national fraternities, as you
mentioned, as well as where 10-
cal chapters deﬁed national chap-

ter law_in pledging whom they '

pleased. With due admiration for

»_ local guts, -this sort of thing is
repugnant to our country’s~basic
,form of government _by laws and

not by man, which extends to all

‘ organizations within oursociety.

now stand, -is through. group. at-

      
  

his interests varied, and his thinking is shrewd and
intelligent. On top of this, the man is outstand-
ingly human—a quality a few are endowed with
and an even smaller number acquire through per-

lifting up his eyes to a cross or
symbol in a church; yet another
may only see, and be helped by
them, by going out and really
looking at the hills.

Almostevery person believes
in something beyond man. Usu-
ally, it is called God; often it’s
called the universe, sometimes
merely the total scheme of things
or the way of nature.
Same Thinking

Mere tolerance of these differ-
ent interpretations, often cover-
ing the belief of one that another
is a _heretic or godless, isn’t the

’ answer. Perhaps it prevents vio-

lence and open persecution. But
it allows no meeting of men’s
minds. ‘ -

Whatever you call that some-
thing beyond man and however
you revere it, the conviction that,
truly, we are all thinking toward
the same end is the common
ground on which we must some-
day meet.

students are looking for money
and are reluctant to waste time

Rejection Impossible

It has been prcven that a Stu"-
dent does well on a subject which
he enjoys whereas he must ap-
ply himself to a much greater de-

, gree in order to grasp a subject "1

in which he has no interest. Thus,
religion cannot be crammed down
the throats of men for they will

only regurgitate the subject with-

out absorbing it. ,

Since the dawn of history,‘ man
has forsaken religion for life and

p then, when confronted with the

end of that" life, turned to relig-
ion. This, man cannot accept or
reject as he chooses. Now or at
a later date, it must be acceptedl

is life in religion. ’ ‘ ‘

titude among fraternities, since
non - discriminatory membership
is impossible as a path in this di-

' rection.

This is because, on the one

hand, ﬂaunting national chapter
law is group suicide, and the af-
fect of external pressure by agi-
tators, on the other, is usually to
arouse resentment and conse-
quent resort to “underground"
activity, by way of another
grand old American custom” of

doing exactly what you’re, told

Dr. John W_. Oliver, head of
Pitt’s department of history and

tee, said today that the foundation
is considering this project along
with three others. The Institute is

- designed to encourage a broader

and deeper study of business and

industry’s contribution to Amer-

“Pittsburgh,” said Dr.
“with its wealth of historical initia-
tive in the development of pioneer
industries, would be a most appro-
priate center for much of this im-
portant work.” '

The program, according to Dr.
Oliver, would have the following
major elements; the development
of an adequate textbook in “Bus-

Minute Scoring

Edges Out Sigma Chi, 33-35

By STEVE

BUTCHOCK I

Kappa Nu’s 10-point halftime lead dwindled to a single
point’ in the ﬁnal 30 seconds before they ﬁnally subdued

an inspired Sigma Chi quinte

t by a 38-35 scoreat the Sta-

._dium Pavilion Wednesday afternoon.

The game started out on a slow:

note with the first ﬁeld goal not
-being scored until the six-minute
mark, and the initial point of the
game wasn’t registered until the
three minute mark. From then on
the tempo of the game picked up
considerably.

Paced by Harvey Levine who
tallied 16 points for scoring hon-
ors in the contest, Kappa Nu ex-
ploded for 17 markers while hold-
ing their opponents to a mere eight
in the second stanza. The home
team greatly outclassing their op-
ponents in the second period, the
only one in which they did, later
proved to be a deciding factor in
the game.

0 u t - p laying, out—rebounding,
and out-scoring the KN’s in the
third period, the Sigs cut the de-
ﬁcit to 5 points as they now trailed
the home team by a 27-22 score.

Continuing their blistering pace,
the Sigs narrowed the gap to one
point at 33-32. The visitors’ fast-
break was working to perfection
against the fading defense of- the
KN’s. Again the latter pulled into
a three-point lead only to ﬁnd the
“never - say quit - come-from-be-
hind” Sigs forge to within a single
tally of tying the game.

Trailing, 36-35, with less than
half a minute remaining, the vis-
itors full court press failed to give
them possession of the ball as they
were charged with a two-shot foul

Take. on Lions

Tomorrow afternoon, as a
prelude to the wrestling,fes-
tivities at Penn State, Pitt’s
freshman wrestlers, under the
guidance of Bob Brennaman, will
lay their undefeated record on the
line.

So far, the yearling grapplers
have tagged losses on Kiski, Le-
high, Franklin & Marshall frosh,
West Virginia frosh, and were held
to a draw by Stevens Trade School.

During the holiday season re-
cess, moreover, the frosh, along
with the varsity, acquitted them-
selves well in the Open Wrestling
Championships at Wilkes College,
particularly 130-pound Ed Peery,
who won his title, and Bill Hulings,
123-pounder, who also placed high.
Competition was keen among the
230 wrestlers who represented 60
schools.

Four members of the squad have
yet to be beaten——Hulings, Peery,
Nick Swentosky (137), Ron Shirf
(177), and Dan Wisniewski
(heavyweight)—as they enter the
season’s ﬁnale.

Cubs with an 83-71 drubbing at
the Beaver Falls gym. The Pan-
thers are still smarting from that
defeat and‘ will be out to gain re-

A win over the Covies would

Teaming together to give the

(Continued from Page 1)
If NSA has been proven non—Com-
mie it is deﬁnitely worth a try.
.FRED MCEVEN, GRAD.: A Uni-
versity this size and of such na-
tional prominence should have
affiliation with a new movement.
BOB BUTCHER, COL. ’57: No’,

it costs too much. Pitt won’t ben-«

eﬁt by NSA for we are an inde-
pendent school. Also the individual
student won’t be beneﬁted.

ALAN GUNDERSON, COL. ’55:
Pitt is gaining national prominence
through its medical center. The
undergraduate school will become

more nationally known also by af- ‘

ﬁliation with NSA.

YALE ROSENSTEIN, COL. ’55:
NSA costs too much, which Stu-
dent Congress cannot afford at this
time. .

BARBARA DOUGLAS, BUS.
AI). ’55: Pitt shouldn’t join for we
are represented well enough na-

- tionally and the money can be

used for. things that will beneﬁt
Pitt more directly.

BILL SCHMITT, COL. ’56: For
money spent, not enough beneﬁts
will be gained.

HARRY SEBEL, RETAILING
’54: My former school, University
of Indiana had NSA and got rid of
it. It is a bad policy for any school
to place their control in an organ-
ization that relies to any extent
upon control from an off campus
source. My answer to this prob-
lem is a well organized local stu-
dent government that isn’t afraid
to function independently.

LUCIO D’ANDREA, E&M '56:
Pitt will gain much by joining
NSA because contacts with other
schools will provide many new

ideas for our Student Government.

PAT STEIN, COL. ’54: There is
no reason why Pitt should not
affiliate with national organiza-
tions and have a seat in national
affairs. NSA will strengthen Pitt’s
student‘ government.

The most recent acclaim for the

In a current survey by the In-

“Wild Flowers" book was selected
as a “striking volume representing
outstanding American Book de-
sign and production.” _

It was one of six books selected

LEO_NARD MYERS, COL. '57:
Pitt will have too many o_bliga—
tions and problems from belong-
ing to NSA. Student Congress has
enough problems of their own.

HARVEY KLEIN, COL. ’55:
Belonging to such an organization
would help bring Pitt into promi-
nence among other colleges. NSA
will help give Pitt the prestige it
so richly deserves.

MARY SABADOS, COL. ’56‘

Pitt will beneﬁt by NSA by hav-
ing closer relationships with other
colleges. Exchanging ideas will
‘help us realize how other people
think.
LEW McCOLLOUGH, Col. '54:
‘NSA conferences have been bene-
ﬁcial to our student leaders. We
should join if the cost is no longer
as prohibitive.
