DigDeeper: T uitionRaised 9.5 %

By TODD ERKEL

‘,‘v Pitt’s Board of Trustees approved

» the 1984 budget last week, which
includes tuition increases for all stu-
dents, most of whom will pay an
additional 9.5 percent or $210 in tui-
tion next year.

The tuition hike, the tenth such
increase in as many years, will raise
full-time, in-state, undergraduate
tuition for the Colleges of Arts and
Sciences and General Studies and
the Schools of Education and Social
Work from $2,210 to $2,420. Tui-

tion for out-of-state students will be

double that.

The Schools. of Engineering,

g,Library and lnforniation Science

(LIS), Nursing and others as well as
graduate and professional programs
will face even higher tuition

increases. Students enrolled in LIS
will be paying an additional $360 or
$2,570 in tuition next year, an
increase of 16.3 percent.

First-year students in the School

of Medicine will be hit the hardest;

their tuition will jump 20.8 percent
to $11,600 a year, an increase of
$2,000.

The $336.7 million operating
budget is contingent on the passage
of the state budget recommended by
Governor Thornburgh which would
include an appropriation of $79.7
million for Pitt, up only l.9 percent

from last year. i  '
“The proposed Commonwealth 2.

increase of less than 2 percent falls
well short of meeting our needs for
the coming year,” Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar said.

Posvar added that while he

remains cautiously optimistic that ‘

the state legislature will pass a
budget similar to the one the gover-
nor recommended in February, a
higher state funding priority will be
«needed if Pitt and other universities
are to meet the challenge of Pennsyl-
vania’s economic renewal.

An emergency may be brewing,
however‘, less than two weeks before
the June 30 budget deadline. The
state legislature has just learned that

estimated state revenues have been

reduced by as much as $150 million
from the Thornburgh administra-
tion's I early; ﬁgures.

.,Pesvar reminded the  of 

past delays in the state budgeting
process, assuring them that the uni-
versity is prepared with “a whole

drawer full of records of past emer- _

gencies concerning budget delays”
should such an occasion arise.

The new curriculum changes that
have been instituted by the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences have met with
mixed reactions from Pitt students.

Brian Richards (College of Arts
and Sciences ‘84) said the new
requirements are unnecessary
because some people are uninter-
ested in what he called “frivolous'
subjects and others are already pro-
ﬁcient in many of the new areas to be

implemented before they come to .

“I came here because this was sup-
posed to be such a ”big research
school,” Richards said. ‘‘lf 1 had to
worry about fitting so many other
courses in, I would never have time
to take some of the science classes I
want.”

The new changes include replac-
ing the current distribution of stu-
dies (DOS) requirement with more
extensive general education require-
ments, as well as adding courses in
composition, quantitative reasoning

and basic foreign language. ' \.

a New Reforms Bring Mixed Reactions

The new requirements will com-
prise anywhere from 39 to 67 credits,
depending on a student's academic
background. For example, a student
can get out of taking a foreign lan-
guage at Pitt by taking three years of
language in high school. Also, some
courses may be used to fulfill more
than one requirement.

It was a complicated process by
which the new requirements were
formulated, according to CAS dean
Irwin Schulman. The process began
over five years ago in 1978 when an

The pending state appropriation

is Pitt's second largest revenue’

source for the ﬁscal year 1984, with
tuition being the major source or
$99.9 million of the $336.7 million
budget.

Posvar called the university’s
budget “austere” but stressed that
the excellence of Pitt's academic
programs would not be compro-
mised.

Pitt chose to pass the contingency
budget despite the continued debate
in Harrisburg while two other state
related institutions—-Penn State and
Temple——have decided to wait on
the legislature’s action.

“Passing a contingency budget at

this time permits us to set tuition

schedules for the fall term and gives
students the opportunity to secure
financing for their education,”
Senior Vice-Chancellor Jack E.
Freeman said.

Pitt students looking for a bright
side to their financial dilemma may
find consolation in the fact that
Pitt's in-state tuition remains’ the
lowest of all the four-year institu-
tions in the.Pittsburgh area.

Of the nine area colleges and uni-
versities, only Point Park College
and the two-year Community Col-
lege of Allegheny County have with-
held tuition hikes for the coming
year. _

Other features of the university's!
budget include a four percent:
increase in salaries for faculty and

staff—2 percent to beaward-ed in ‘
across-the-beard raises, the-remain-~ ..

ing 2 percent t-o be given for merit,
promotions and equity adjustments.
Stipends for graduate student assist-
ants, teaching assistants and teach-
ing fellows will also increase to
$4,500, 5 ,450 and $5,775.
respectively.

Campus Cop Held
In Shooting Incident

A university policeman has been
arrested and suspended from duty
without pay after he fired a shot at
two men during an altercation on
Pittsburgh's South Side on June 5.

John R. Marquez, 27, of 5535
Hobart St., Squirrel Hill, has been
charged with two counts each of
aggravated assault and recklessly
endangering another person and one
count of violating a city ordinance
that prohibits the unlawful firing of
a gun.

The charges stemmed from events
that- followed a shouting incident
between Marquez and two men-—
Thomas DeI(laven, 21, of 1619 St.
Patrick St., and Robert Dusch, 20,
of 80 S. 26th St.——after a near colli-
sion between Marquez’ car and that
driven by DeKlaven.

New Reforms Bring Mixed Reactions  

continued from page one

FAS council endorsed a statement
defining the purposes of the faculty

j ‘ and of the college.

In April 1979, FAS passed a reso-
lution allowing Schulman to
appoint a committee which would
propose changes in the existing cur-

. riculum in accordance with the pur-

poses outlined in the FAS statement
a year before.
This group, the College of Arts

and Sciences Committee on Curric-

ulum Reform, consisted of six
faculty members from the humani-

_ ties, six from natural sciences, nine

from the social sciences, four stu-
dents and the dean.

Meanwhile, the Board of Trustees
had approved a doument called the
“University Planning Policies for
the 1980s,” calling for Schulman to
initiate discussions with F AS in
order to redeﬁne “the purposes of
liberal education and specific ways
of achieving those purposes.” This
redefinition was crucial, Schulman
said, because many credits had been
dropped from the distribution
requirements over the years. _

Shortly after Schulman
appointed the Committee on Curric-
ulum Reform, a subcommittee was
elected. That subcommittee met ﬁve
times between October and
December 1981 and made several
reform proposals in accordance with

. CAS‘s outlined goals, a study of ‘

alumni. transcripts and an alumni
questionnaire. These proposals were
then reviewed and amended by the
full committee. The present report
was approved by the committee in
its final meeting on June 5, 1981. .

The purpose of the requirements
is two-fold. First, it reflects a grow-
ing trend toward liberal arts in edu-
cation and second, it seeks to rectify
some less broadly-based high school
curricula which haven’t prepared
students for college level work,
Schulman said.

The required courses are as fol-
lows: Writing courses—including
Basic Writing, Composition and
two of the newly designed “W"
courses; algebra and one other

. quantitative reasoning course(trigo-

nometry does not fulﬁll this require-
ment); two terms of college-level
foreign language; one course in liter-
ature; one course in music or art; a
second course in literature, art,
music or creative expression; one
course in philosophy; one course in

Multi-Cultured Picnic Held At Flagstaff  

By’ LAURA SCHAFRON

On Saturday, June 18, the Pitt
International Student Organiza-
tion (PISO) hosted an intercul-
tural family picnic which was
partially funded by the Graduate
and Professional Student Organ-
ization (GPSA) and celebrated
that groups recent commitment
to PISO. ,

Gina Pachuta, PISO vice-
president and organizer of the
picnic, said that the event had
been in the planning stages for a
long time.

“The problem at first was
money,“ said Pachuta. “After we
got the GPSA funding, the big-
gest problem was the timing.
This picnic falls right in the mid-
dle of Moslem Holy Week, and
all our Moslem members will be
fasting."

the social sciences; one history

course; a second course chosen for I

the social sciences, history or public
policy; a two-term sequence in phy-
sical or behavioral science; a third
science course in a field other than
that sequence; two courses in foreign
culture; and finally, one course in a
non-western foreign culture.

These are to be chosen from a list
of approved courses. Schulman said
the committee “reviewed ‘hundreds
of courses” in chosing this list and
that “other courses will be added."

The FAS committee has triedto
ensure that its new standards will be
met without sacrificing the students’
choice of courses.

“I think one ofthe things that stu-
dents like about Pitt is the ﬂexibility
they have (in choosing courses).
We've tried to keep that,” Schulman
said. “As it is now, a student can get
through the university taking very
few large classes if he’s clever. With
so many C01 _ - -'s to choose from, stu-
dents will still be able to do this.

In addition to revising the DOS
requirements, the Committee on
Curriculum Reform has also sug-
gested that CAS develop new two-
course sequences to round out
knowledge in interdisciplinary
areas. Also new is the implementa-
tion of “W” courses._ These are
courses develped jointly by the Eng-
lish compostion department and one
other department. They are
designed both to teach the basic
principles in an academic discipline
and to develop students’ writing
skills. At least 20 pages of written
work with some revision is required,
and one recitation period a week is
given to discussion of the students.’
writing style. The idea was based on
a similar group of courses currently
offered at the University of
Michigan.

The foreign culture requirement is
designed to allow students to take
advantage of foreign studies pro-
grams at Pitt, and several of the
approved foreign culture courses
were modeled after similar ones
being,taught at Indiana University
at Bloomington, Schulman said.

“A lot of students don't realize
that Pitt has some very strong pro-
grams. The Latin American Studies
Program, for example, is very
good," he said. ,

Schulman said he sees a real need
to expose students to foreign cul-
tures because many are from rela-

Nevertheless, approximately
40 people ‘attended the event on
Schenley Park’s Flagstaff Hill,
enjoying the sunny weather and
good food. Each family was
asked to contribute one dish to
the smorgasbord-style meal,
although several families came
with full coolers and blankets in
true picnic fashion. Children's
activities were provided by
Activities by Maria of the Pitts-
burgh lnterculture House.

The new relationship between
GPSA and PISO makes possible
many more events than PISO
had been able to plan in the past.
Lisa Veer, secretary of GPSA
explained, “Before, we mostly
served in an advisory position.
Now, we're providing money.”

PISO has many plans for that
money. The organization will
once again sponsor an Interna-
tional Festival, showcasing the

tively small communities and have
had little chance to interact with
such cultures before coming to
Pittsburgh.

“A lot of people are a bit paroch-
ial,” he explained. “There’s a big dif-
ference in moving from McKeesport
to Oakland.”

The extensive requirements may
encourage more students to major in
the traditional liberal arts areas,
although this was not one of the
committee’s intentions. At the same
time, Schulman said they “may have
a depressing effect on the number of
double majors" although “more
joint majors may be developed.”

The dean sees no conflict with
other requirements a student may
have or want to fulﬁll, despite the
comparatively large number of cred-
its the general education courses
comprise. Because some depart-
ments, namely physics, geology and
chemistry, require 55 or more credits

'in their programs whereas other

departments require as few as 30
credits, students majoring in these
three areas may waive up to six cred-
its from the group of general educa-
tion requirements. According to
Schulman, this should alleviate any
problems for students who have hec-
tic class schedules. 

Richards disagrees.

“I would rather know a lot about
my major than a little bit about ever-
ything else. After all, I’ll be using my
science courses for the rest of my life.
I'll never use an anthropology class.”
Laurie Brennen, a freshman in the
School of Engineering, on the other
hand, said the requirements are a
good idea.

“I think that everyone needs to
know about things like art,” she
said, adding that she generally likes
the stronger emphasis on the liberal
arts as a background for an overall
education. Although she is involved

with science in her field, she said that -

math and science

food, art and entertainment.

Also, PISO is planning to
sponsor a lecture series and is
working,on a new information
packet to be distributed at the
special orientation session held
for foreign students. Finally,
PISO is working on plans to‘
initiate a day care center for for-
eign graduate students since
many are unaware of or unable
to take advantage of other facili-
ties in the city.

The group’s main goal, how-
ever, is to promote intercultural
awareness among all students.
For this reason, PISO has
recently expanded and now
includes both graduate and
undergraduate foreign and
American students.

“PISO is a purely social group,
and not a political one,” Pachuta
emphasized. '

Opinion I

\

Women
  In High
  Places

Two events this month have captured Ameri-

‘ ca’s imagination and dramatized this nation’s

rush into the future. Last week, Voyager 10 ﬂew

into the headlines by becoming the first man-

-made object to venture outside our solar system.

t Then the space shuttle Challenger carried Ameri-

ca’s first woman astronaut and the largest space-
crew ever into orbit.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, we are led to
remark how slowly this country has joined the
20th century in terms of respecting the rights of
women. '

Today it seems that true equality between the
sexes is, at last, on the horizon. After all, we now
have one woman on the Supreme Court and
‘another in space. Late as they may be, these are
significant symbolic victories for American
women. Yet they are more than merely symbolic
victories, and this is important, for the enemies of
sexual equality cannot say that Justice Sandra
O'Connor and physicist-astronaut Sally Ride
were given something for nothing. Each has risen
to the top of a very skilled and competitive field to
positions traditionally accorded the highest
respect. ’ ’ A

Still, Justice O’Connor and Dr. Ride‘ stand as
symbols of the progress of the American woman,
and it is sadly ironic that something other than
the cause of equality may reap the greatest benefit
from that fact.

It is ironic that the Soviet Union was putting
women in orbit long before we had heard of Sally
Ride; perhaps even more ironic that Ronald
Reagan——whose stand against the Equal Rights
Amendment marked him for many as an oppo-
nent of women’s rights-—was the first to name a
woman to our highest court. Certainly no one

‘ understands the importance of symbolic victories
for equality more than those who intend to veto
any real gains.

It would bewrong to downplay these signs of
progress entirely, however, for they represent the
first steps down a road we must travel—it matters
little in the end who starts us off. In other words,
we should not look these gift horses in the mouth.
But as we reflect that it was the Russians and the
Reagans who have, so far, raised women to the
highest levels, a timeless piece of advice suggests
itself. Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

Letters To The Editor

Pessimism Is All Too Familiar

Dear Editor:

After reading the article “Aca-
demic Standards Don’t Make the
Grade," (The Pitt News, June 8), the
picture described was all too real,
especially in the stereotypical des-
criptiveness of a problem that sup-

‘ “Wow! Man, there
he goes; he's the best
athlete I've ever seen;
but he's probably
failing his classes, he
won't graduate.’ "

posedly affects both black and white
athletes. The confrontation between
the two former star athletes who
were once glorified and praised on
the courts but are now left to “hang
in the streets ofthe inner city” is one
that has grown both tired and dis-
tressing because of its irritating
familiarity. M

Negative articles such as this one
have constantly plagued readers
from The Pitt News to The New
York Times. Stories depict the uned-
ucated star athlete, the controversy
between the N.C.A.A. and the SAT
committee and the black colleges
around the country, the Nevada-Las
Vegas recruiting policies, or closer

4

is

to home, Penn State‘s insensitivity
toward black athletes, and right
here, the statisticsof black athletes
who actually graduate from Pitt.
Like I said before, the problem
has always been written about,
intending proposals to rectify the
situation have also been presented,
so how about an unfamiliar twist to
the story, say one about the prob-
lem’s being conquered? Mr. Zeff, as
a writer, should try to cover every
aspect of a situation, but he has so
far opted on being totally one-
dimensional. So now both he and
many of his readers suffer from an
overt stock-responsive attitude.
The general perception is one that

‘ 206$ like this;

“Wow! Man, there he goes; he's
the best athlete I have ever seen; but
he’s probably failing all his classes:
he won’t graduate.” (Notice.I ne-

glected to elaborate on the setting
and the characterization.)

Don’t you, as a sportswriter think
that positive articles about athletes
can be written for your many read-
ers; like the one about Kevin Ross
(The New York Times, May 25)
who, after his college basketball elig-
ibility at Creighton University ran
out, realized that he was reading
below the seventh grade level. He
then enrolled in Marva Collins’ Chi-
cago Westside Preparatory School
(for eighth graders) and is now read-
ing at the college sophomore level.

A fantastic accomplishment, if I
should say so, and one achieved off
the playing fields and in the class-

rooms. If this reader, and many oth-

articles on the athlete's (black-or
white) “Not making the grade,"
wonder how the athletes must feel,
especially at this university that has
so many enrolled.

‘There are no articles
written about the
athlete who achieves
academic excellence
but who probably
won't make it in the
pros.’

There are no articles written
about the athlete who achieves aca-
demic excellence but who probably
won't make it in the pros and suc-
ceeds in some other alternative. It
would be an incentive to those ath-
letes who finally realize that the
longing dream of a profitable
athletic career becomes nothing but
a dream—in black and white.

HEADS CAN'T CONTROL IT

‘ SP EAK IN GIN TO NGU ES

Talking Heads
Sire

Talking Heads have returned
after a rather lengthy absence
with their first album of all-new
material since 1980's Remain In
Light.

The new one, intriguingly
titled (and spelled out) SP EAK
IN GI N TO NGLI E5, is a further
exploration of the territory
sampled by its predecessor.
David Byrne, chief songwriter
and motivator, delves further
into the realm of funk in its pur-
est state, with percussion domi-
nant and melodic hooks a
definite second.

The material here is techni-
cally flawless and finely crafted;
the rhythms are intricate, com-
plex and dazzling—everything
but predictable. As usual, Byrne
plays with the accepted formats
of songwriting and rhyme
schemes, inventing new tradi-
tions and attaching titles like

"Making Flippy Floppy” and
”This Must Be the Place (Naive
Melody)." The songs are neat,
perhaps not as instantly accessi-
ble as those on Remain in Light;
there's no "Once In a Lifetime”-
type instant hit on the new
album, but what's here is an
interesting hybrid: good funk
dance music for the feet and
intellectual puzzles for the
mind.

Byrne's lyrics continue to be
insightful and at times cryptic.
"I got a girl that's better than that, '' he
says in "Girlfriend is Better,”
"She has the smoke in her eyes/she's
coming up, going rightthrough my
heart/she's gonna give me surprise."
Or "I guess I must be having fun/ the
less we say about it the better/making it
up as we go along," he says in "This
Must Be the Place." In "Burning
Down the House,” he describes
himself as "strange but not a stran-
ger/I'm an or-di-na-ry guy."
Hmm.....

Byrne remains one of the
most distinctive singers in the

TALKING HEADS

business; SP EAK IN GI N TO
NGL1 ES explores his range, the
low growling through "Swamp"
to the frenetic heights of "Moon
Rocks" or "Pull Up the Roots."
Talking Heads continue to
expand their musicianship; Tina
Weymouth offers synthesizer
as well as bass; drummer Chris
Frantz also supplies vocals and
synthesizer; and Jerry Harrison
contributes keyboards, guitar
and vocals. Byrne, in addition to
his singing chores, plays every-

thing. An assorted group of 10

guest artists provides additional
instrumentation; Nona Hen-

ground vocal.

Today's Special: Holly Be

th Vincent and the Waitresses

BRUISEOLOGY
The Waitresses
Polydor

The Waitresses are in trouble.
(Never mind the new LP—we'll
get to that later.) Here's the
story in a nutshell: Patty
Donahue, lead singer/talker for
this bandand the most impor-
tant person in the group save
Chris Butler, decided to leave
the Waitresses immediately
upon completion of Bruiseology,
their second album. Holly Beth
Vincent, who's best known for
one album fronting Holly And
The Italians, was chosen as her
replacement—a risky move
since Vincent's style is nothing

like Donahue’s signature sing-
song whine. After one month as
a Waitress (the month of May
1983 to be exact), Vincent is
fired, reportedly for missing a
performance. Donahue is
coaxed back, and just when
everything begins to get back to
normal, Chris Butler quits.
Now, the band had a pretty
good chance of surviving with-

out Donahue, but without

Butler? He was the core of the
band, the one with the impres-
sive background (main force for
the cult-followed Tin Huey back

  

in the '70s) who wrote the songs
that shaped the Waitresses’
niche. It doesn't look good to say
the very least, but so much for
the band's future, and back to
the present....

Bruiseology is much like the
band's debut LP, Wasn't Tomor-
row Wonderful? Patty still doesn't
exactly sing, but her petulant
vocals are nonetheless inviting.
On thewhimsically-entitled cut

”Everything's Wrong If My Hair '

Is Wrong," for example, you can
almost picture her standing, one
hand on hip, cigarette in the
other, chomping gum and
declaring, "Everything's wrong if my
hair is wrong/Everything's wrong if
my hair is..." Donahue and Butler

’ have managed to turn the lead

singer into a real personality;
Patty Donahue isn't so much
the lead singer as the leading
character in a film.

The rest of the album, even if
it isn't anything totally different
than what we've come to expect
from the Waitresses, is funny

' and fresh. Songs like ”Thinking
About Sex Again," "They're All
Out Of Liquor, Let's Find
Another Party" and "A Girl's
Gotta Do" are memorable not
only for their catchy choruses
but also for . the funny yet

serious women's persona por-
trayed in the words. In "A Girl's
Gotta Do," the singer is talking
about the unequality of so many
male/female relationships: "I've
got a zillion facts/That can help you
out/‘ But they just make you ner-
vous/I'm not so sure/The decisions
you're making//ire really in my best
interest."

Gone are the days when you
could see the Waitresses at the
sleazy Electric Banana and rub
elbows with Chris Butler & Co.
And perhaps we'll never get to
see them again, but in the mean-
time, pick up a copy of Bruiseology
for the memories if nothing
more.

Sweet Dreams Are Made of
This

The Eurythmics

RCA Records

Technopop, the synthesized
sound of the '80s, seems to have
flooded the music industry.
Although its trademark sounds
have been exploited into a
trendy synthesized boredom,
e.g. A Flock of Seagulls and The
Fixx, it's now quite obvious that
this technology has found a per-
manent place in the recording
world, just like the electric gui-
tar. It's refreshing when crea-
tive musicians with innovative,
modern ideas find this technol-
ogy useful to express them-
selves. This distinguishes the
Eurythmics’ album Sweet Dreams
Are Made of This from much of
the other dull synthesized pop
analagous to a sales demonstra-
tion tape revealing the awesome
versatility of some sophisticated
computer.

Annie Lennox and David Ste-
wart, ex-members of the now-

disbanded Tourists, are

 = EURYTHMICS

musicians, songwriters and per-
fomers. In 1980, they formed
the Eurythmics, and the recent
release of Sweet Dreams Are Made
Of This places them among the
select artists who actually use
music as a vehicle to express
artistic talent. The result is an
album that really sounds new—
not ahead of its time, but
worthy of a "sound of '83"
designation.

Listening to the Eurythmics is
very pleasurable, especially
since they do not impose an arti-
ficial state upon the listener.
Their instrumental aspects are
fresh—sounding and lively,
pushing a danceable beat into
the listener's periphery without
becoming overbearing. This is
reminiscent of Motown: dance-
able, but also verylistenable.
The ultimate success of their
sound emerges with the vocal
components.

Most obvious is Annie Len-
nox’s full-bodied, soulful, yet
distinctively modern, voice.
These qualities surface on "I
Could Give You a Mirror,"
highlighting her soulful side,
and "Love is a Stranger," where
she almost sounds mechanical.
The title track, receiving steady
airplay, is indicative of the
Eurythmics’ style and demon-
strates the quality of this album.
This is a must, regardless of
your previous experienceswith
syntho-pop.

BY LINDA HENRY

Most Americans are more familiar
with Shakespeare's comedies and
tragedies than his history plays, but
to overlook the Three Rivers Shake-

- speare Festival's current production

‘of Henry IV, Part I for lack of familiar-

I9

with a rather dubious but lovable
bunch of characters whose haunt is
the Boar's Head Inn. Hal's mentor
there and surrogate father is one of
Shakespeare's most colorful charac-
ters, Sir John Falstaff. Hal eventually
shuns the good—time life to put on
arms and defend the throne, thus

ity would be a shame. It has every-
thing a modern audience could want,
including sex and violence.

The play is less about King Henry
IV than his son Henry's (Prince Hal)
"coming of age” and acceptance of his
role as heir to the throne. In the

beginning, Hal is content to hang out ~

Showcase, Wednesday June 2«l2',ll'9'83'

Stephen Coleman has crafted his
show in such a way that it is impossi-
ble for the audience to see it that way.

Hotspur, the lusty foil to the fun-
loving Prince Hal is every bit as dash-
ing as the renegade prince. Daniel
Southern, in his first appearance
with the Shakespeare Festival, plays
Hotspur with such humanity it is

hard to know who to root for when

the battle actually begins. Southern
chooses to give Hotspur's speech a
stamvmer when he is angry, emphas-
izing the sympathetic nature of this
intense character.

It is by no mere coincidence that
Hotspur is the only male lead shown
with his wife before setting out to
war. No bad guy could be loved with
the emotion Maura Minteer as Lady
Percy displays for her husband.
Women in this play are few and far
between since it is essentially a story
of man's world, boozing and whoring
and warring. But despite the short-
ness of this one scene, the emotional
impact drawn from it serves to
remind us. that women do exist here,
and, especially in the case of Hotspur,
are very much a part of their men's
lives. '

We also see women, mostly
wenches, in every Boar's Head Inn
Scene, run by the no-nonsense Hos-
tess Mistress Quickly played by Lisa
Bansavage. In these scenes, however,
it is the antics of Falstaff and his fol-
lowers and his relationship ,with
Prince Hal that grab us.

Arthur J. Beer is a delightful,
rotund Falstaff. Once again this pro-
duction has dug deep to the inner
core of these characters as we see
Falstaff's serious side here rather
than just presenting us with a giant-
sized buffoon. In the final scene of
Act One, Falstaff and Hal engage in a _
role-playing episode to ready the
prince to face his father the next
morning. As Falstaff portrays first

THE LAST ONE—-film tribute to
Elvis Presley, June 25 at the Stanley

King Henry, then Hal himself, his
fear of losing Hal's affection is shown
as is Hal's genuine love for the jolly
rogue.

Robert Martini is the spirited
Prince Hal and once again, (he was__

Hamlet in last year's production 

TRSF) he is a delight to watch.» I
caught myself, for a time, in the con-
frontation scene with his father,
simply watching the changing tense-
ness of the muscles in Martini's face
and neck.

For that matter, the deptgh of con-
centration of the entire company
from the non-speaking soldiers and
wenches to the lead players is amaz-
ing. With such a large cast it is impos-

sible to mention everyone, but so 2

standouts were: Daniel Frezza (King

~ Henry), Ian D. Shupeck (Westmore-

land), Keith David (Worcester) and
the rollicking followers of Falstaff
including Steven Brown as Peto, Ken
Bolden as Poins, Richard Ewing as
Gadshill and a clownlike Alexander
Cook as Bardolph.

Characterization was the emphasis
here accented by Tony Ferrieri's set
design utilizing minimal use of props
and scenery and a wide open, raked
stage. Pageantry was not forsaken as
banners signifying the opposing
teams were lowered and raised, color

coordinated costumes designed  '

Henry Heymann (blues for King
Henry's clan, rusty reds for Percy and
his followers) were on parade, period
music composed by Christine Frezza
aided scene changes and drummers
stood on stage marking rhythm dur-
ing the climactic battle scene at the
end of the play. The battle and sword
fight to the death between Hal and
Hotspur is a chilling spectacle choreo-
graphed by director Coleman.

The dramatic throughline of this
production is passion. It grips from the

start and rises with the power HQ‘,

GANDHI: THE SCREENPLAY
John Briley
Grove Press

THE WORDS OI-' GANDHI
Selected by Richard Atten-
borough

Newmarket Press

The bapu is back, and by the
looks of all these books being
released in the wake of Richard
Attenborough’s Gandhi, he's
bigger than ever. Mohandas
Gandhi is suddenly being mer-
chandised as some sort of E.T.
for the esoteric (or middle-aged
and balding if you prefer).
There are shirts, posters, skull
caps and tons and tons of books.
Most of the publications are just
cosmic drivel, shallow attempts
at cashing in on the Mohatma’s
sudden resurgence. Two of the
following books fall into this
category; one doesn't.

Gandhi The Man is a classic
example of a bad book. This sup-
posed chronicle of the Indian
leader's life is a rambling and
oh—so-superficial account that,
from the beginning, puts
Gandhi on a pedestal of purity
and leaves the reader with the
impression that the wondrous
bapu never erred during his
fruitful life. In addition, the nar-
rative is horribly disjointed and
often breaks away in the middle
of a passage describing some
aspect of Gandhi's life only to
begin on a completely unrelated
description. As if that weren't
enough, the book contains an
appendix that attempts to
explain completely—in 30
pages—the mechanism of
Satyagraha, which is, more or
less, the concept of nonviolence
that Gandhi founded his entire
life upon. C'mon, there should
be a law against this.

much more professional
attempt to cash in on the movie,
is nonetheless another ripoff.
This book is merely a screenplay
of Attenborough's flick, and
therefore should not exist.
Kfter all, who is going to read
this when it would be much
more enjoyable to sit through
the film and see moving pictures
along with the dialogue (what a
concept!). This book's only pur-
pose might be to serve as one of
those extremely. tedious publi-
cations that some people leave
on their toilets for those of an .
irregular background.

The Words Of Gandhi is a com-

pletely different story. Yes, it is
meant to profit from the movie,
but this book is quite tastefully
done. Richard Attenborough, in
his obsession with Gandhi's life,
has put together an enticing col-
lection of the Mohatma’s quota-
tions and essays. Packaged like
Gibran’s The Prophet, it is
refreshing and reads in no time.
In addition, it exposes Gandhi's
apparent brilliance in a way that
is neither maudlin nor
pristine—through Gandhi's
own words. This is the one to
buy.

CONSUMING PASSIONS
Peter Farb and George Armelagos
Washington Square

The bride and groom cut the wed-
di“rig\‘cake. Cows are sacred in India.
Chicken soup is good for a cold.
”What’s eating you?" Cool as a
cucumber. McDonald's. "She’s a
dish." Don't forget corny jokes,
hammy actors and that car—it's a
lemon. Now: what’ve all these got in
common?

Ever since Adam and Eve and the
apple, eating has held a central posi-
tion in the human being's lifestyle.
Consuming Passions, by the late Peter
Farb and ‘George Armelagos, is a fas-
cinating and informative study of the
anthropology of eating around the
world and through history. How did
today's attitudes and beliefs about
food develop? The biological base is
examined, as well as the sociological,
religious, and even sexual signifi-

’ cance of the meal.

Eating is an adaptive process which
has transcended the bounds of break-
fast, lunch, and dinner. ”To know
what, where, how, when, and with
whom people eat is to know the char-
acter of their society," according to
Farb and Armelagos. (We really are
what we eat.) Consuming Passions is
intriguing, well——-written and docu-

mented, easily understood, and
entertaining—eye-opening food for
thought.

Woman's Day Book of Baking
The Editors of Woman's Day
Pocket "

And now a possible cause of Con-
suming Passion: the Woman's Day Book
of Baking. ”There is something deeply
satisfying, almost magical in trans-
forming simple ingredients into
golden brown loaves of bread, flavor-
ful cakes, tender muffins, flaky pies
and mouth watering cookies.” It's
trite but effective propaganda

. because it's true.

The preface and the chapter intro-
ductions drip with persuasion and
adjectives which mean "tastes good,”
but the recipes can speak for them-
selves. The editors of Woman's Day
have assembled a nice selection of
plain and fancy cake, pie, bread and
cookie recipes. Basic baking tips and
information about ovens and ingre-
dients are provided for the beginner;
neither the experienced cook nor the
novice will have trouble following the
detailed recipes.

Missing from Book of Baking are pho-
tographs of finished product, which
ought to be‘ a requirement for any

collection of this sort—photos pro-
vide incentive and goal. The most
annoying problem with this or any
other similar paperback is that it's
nearly impossible to keep it open to
the proper page when following a
recipe. Still, the Woman's Day Book of
Baking is a thoroughly satisfactory
cooking book. Tempting.

The Hart of
The Matter

A NEW DEMOCRACY
Gary Hart Quill

Gary Hart for President?

His new book, A New Democracy,
amounts to little more than a 177-
page campaign speech by the Colo-
rado senator who is a candidate for
the 1984 Presidential election. Easily
read by the layman, the ’book
emphasizes the changesour world is
undergoing, and how we as a nation.
should work towards shaping our
future. '

Reading A New Democracy is like
being trapped in a time capsule where
spirits are low and government has
failed, and the reader is just waiting
to get out into the make—believe
world of I-Iart’s idealistic liberalism.
”America's character is being tested
in the 1980s," I-Iart writes.'Consider-
ing the picture he paints of America
today, we must be flunking the exam.

I-Ie blatantly blames the country's
present state on the short-
sightedness of Reaganomics, and he
explains how to get the system going
productively again so that it will not
fail us on a long-term basis. . «

Specifying the duties of the federalai
government rather than those of the

people, Hart repeatedly stresses the 
conflict between the myopic Teagan 

and Congress, and the long-range
perspective of "thinking” politicians‘
like himself. Hart's rhetoric provides
idealism when there is none and
sheds‘ realism in areas where it is
being denied by the present govern-
ment. He sprinkles Republican ”back
to basics" ideology with the concepts
of neo-liberalism.

I-Iart has designed a step-by-step
long-term plan to "restore" our
nation's greatness. Three key areas
for action he focuses on are: the
balancing of the monetary and fiscal
policies of the federal government;
the restoration of industrial health by
modernizing traditional industries
and stimulating new growth indus-
tries; and the mobilization and full
use ‘of "our most important
resource"—people.

Initiatives in each of these areas
should be taken by the federal
government, whose role, according
to Hart,'should be "the ultimate gua-
rantor of social justice and equal
opportunity,”

Covering every conceivable area of
focus of the federal government and
then some, Hart fails to answer one

a big question: What if one step in his

perfectly-designed plan is not suc-
cessful? Will the whole political and
economic "system" then fall apart?
The book is not one for pessimists;
it concentrates on change and revital-
izing America's depressed spirits and
economy. "To understand where we
should be going,” he writes, "we must
look at where we are and how we. are
changing.” One of I-Iart's first actions
as President, he promises, will be to
establish a Council on Emerging
Issues to anticipate and identify
industrial and ecomonic trends.

As Machiavelli explained four»

hundred years ago the general con-
cepts of deception and manipulation,
Hart gives meaning to once-
ambiguous terms like ”urban mod-
ernization” and "economic
interdependence.” And, as we now
view Machiavelli's political theories
as revolutionary for his time, 50
years from now, A New Democracy
might well be protocol for ”tradi-
tional" neo-liberalism.

Goes Unmatched In
  Prominence

By scorr DELLETT

The All-England Club Tennis

‘-53- Championship——commonly

knownas Wimbledon—is some-
thing more than one event in the
Grand Slam of Tennis. Wim-
bledon is much more than that.
The question is what makes it so
special.

First, it is probably the most
recognized event on the tennis
tour. Can anyone name 1982
French Open champion? A little
research and the name Mats
Wilander comes out. But most
can name the Wimbledon cham-
pion since 1974.

Wimbledon set the standards
for television coverage, impor-
tant in establishing credibility to
a sport. Before, tennis coverage
was limited. This year alone,
NBC televised both the men’s
and women's finals of the French
Open. Home Box Office have
been offering expanded coverage
of Wimbledon.

The grass surface also gives
attention ‘to this tournament.
Some, like lvan Lendl in the past
and French Open winner Yan-
nick Noah, have refused to go
near suburban London in laie
June. Try to play on grass for a
couple hours and see how the
back is in the morning. Like
John McEnroe on clay, some
players just can't adjust to this
surface.

Speaking of McEnroe, despite
the criticism he has suffered in
the past, Wimbledon should be
glad he decided to participate
despite a painful shoulder injury.

Although the. British press have

been as harsh on McEnroe as the
native New Yorker is on lines-
men, he does bring attention to
the tournament. Besides, he
could bring in a couple hundred
spectators just to see what he's
going to do next.

Maybe all the fuss is due to the
tradition of the event. The place
sets the whole world back fifty
years or so, with the proper
names on the scoreboard
(members of the All-England
club went into shock when an
electronic scoreboard was
installed at Centre Court before
last year’s championship) the
strawberry and- cream, the
proper court behavior
demanded. etc.

But it may be due to the out-
standing tennis played year in
and year out. The men’s final
always etches its way to the
chronicle of greatest tennis
matches ever. Bjorn Borg’s dom-
inance, McEnroe breaking his
string, the numerous five set
matches, the long, furiously
fought tiebreakers—-it‘s all there
at Wimbledon.

This year’s event has shown
the potential of being as memor-
able as in past years. Already
three high seeds in the men's div-
ision. No.4 Guillermo Vilas, No.
7 Jose Luis Clerc and No.9 Steve
Denton-—have been eliminated
in the first round while in the
ladies division-using Wim-
bledon terminology—-Tracy
Austin has withdrawn due to
back problems and sixth-seeded
Bettina Burg has been knocked
out. ‘

By MARK A. SiNDLER

Last season was not exactly one
which Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis
will look back upon as a high-
scoring year during the 29 or so sea-
sons that have now made him an
instituition atop Trees Hall.

Graduated Erie Tiedtke, all 140
lbs. of him, only punched in eight
goals and former teammate John
Hagenbuch was next, registering a
paltry six. A reordering of priorities
was etched on Bemis’ mind as he
finished the ’82 campaign intent on
bringing in a large inventory of
forwards.

His hours of recruiting travels
now complete, Bemis has done just
that. But, oh, those hours. Bemis
gave the middle Atlantic states a
good walking over as he traversed
such states as Eastern Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia and New York
among others.

Excluding the obvious walk-ons
he’ll be counting on when spring
camp opens August 25, Bemis will
be expecting 13 former scholastic
players whom he sought for the 1983
schedule. Is the number an omen of
things to come?

Only the superstitious should be
aware. However—and that's a sig-
niﬁcant however——the thrust of the
squad’s scoring threat may very well
fall upon the yet inexperienced
shoulders of the incoming freshmen.

Either way, though, there wasn’t
much else Bemis could- do. Last
year’s scoring threat amounted to an
army of ants’ intentions of overtak-
ing a supermarket. So Bemis prim-

forward vacancy.

 

Current forwards and the incom-
ing ones cannot do much worse than’
what was revealed last season. Try-
ing to turn things around will be:

0 Matt Becker——Named all-
WPIAL during his junior year at
North Allegheny and will be utilized
by Bemis as forward/midfielder.

Bemis said of Becker, who can
play anywhere, “I’ve seen himplay
almost everything, including goal.
Most importantly, he knows where
the goal is.”

0 Marcus Brown——The Mecha-

‘nicsburg, Pa., native hails from

Cumberland Valley High School
where he was employed as a back
and a midfielder.

.“He’s somebody who contacted
me and said ‘I’m coming to Pitt,’ ”
Bemis said. “I’ve already seen him
play indoors and think he’s a decent
ballplayer.”

0 Mark Connolly——“I saw him
play last Saturday,” Bemis said of
the former Erie Cathedral Prep
star,” when he contacted me and
said he was interested in" Pitt.”

The 6-0, 160-lb. forward/wing
has been playing for an amateur
league in the northern part of the
state, as he’ll continue to do during
the summer. This in one player,
Bemis added, who has the size and
skills to be more competitive than
the characteristic freshman.

“He?s atypical of the player com-
ing to college today,” he continued.
“Connolly is the first player to come
through his high school with three
years of high school experience. He
also has sandlot and junior high

‘experience, which adds up to about
eight or nine years of playing time.”

0 Richard Godfrey—From Mary-
land, Godfrey excelled in more than

Pittsburgh’: Dave Parker begins his slide into home plate on a ball hit by Tony Pena in the
* mm Inning oi the June 18th game against Philadelphia. Parker managed tosllde past

1' .

one sport at Falston «High School-
the last ‘four years. A 5-11, 170-lb.
forward, Godfrey was a point guard
on the state’s championship basket-
ball team and was subsequently

heavily recruited by southern Div- '

ision II schools.
He is also one of Maryland’s top
handicapped youth golfers.

0 Bob Howard——Claiming he is

“very dangerous in the air,” Bemis T

plans on using the 6-2, 190-lb. How-
ard at striker, a position he was
accustomed to serving at Fairfax
High School in Virginia.

Howard also played a role in the
amateur Fairfax Fhoenixes, win-.
ning Virginia’s l7-and-under cham-
pionship last year. Composed of
members from various high schools,
the Fhoenixes were coached tolsuch
high standards by -1968 alumni

' Angelo Stoyas.

Said Bemis of Howard, “Stoyas
has coached Bob since he was 12
years old, and he’s surprisingly fast
for a big man, although I’ve told him
to come to camp at about 185. We're
going to need him on attack.”

0, Swaray Kamara——A native of
Africa, Kamara has been in the Uni-
ted States only five or six years and
yet was named All-New York City
and All-Regional youth player.(in
New York state) while toiling away
at Brooklyn Tech High School.

“Swaray played a lot of junior
high and amateur ball,” Bemis said.
“He has good speed, can shoot well
with both feet and has good ball
control.” »

Bemis will have Kamara (6-0, 170-
lb.) see action primarily at striker
and / or wing.

0 Dave Selby—Registering in at

backfrom Willingboro High School
in New Jersey may be a bit on the
slender side, Bemis noted.

“I haven't seen him play,” he con-
tinued, “but he was here for the
recruiting weekend during the win-
ter. I've also had him scouted by a
New Jersey coach, and I'm told that
he's a good, steady, solid player."

Selby reportedly turned down an
offer by Eastern soccer power,
Rutgers. " ’

‘‘He's got a better shot here than in
their high-powered program,”
Bemis remarked.

from Mechanicsburg High School,

rently playing for the Pennsylvania

Lexington, I(y., Grimesjust ﬁnished
playing for the state's l7-and-under
and I9-and-under Select Teams.
During his junior year at Lafayette
High School, he was also named all-
state as a forward/ midfielder.

“I know nothing about Kentucky
soccer,” Bemis said, “but I’ went
down there two Saturdays ago and
found out he'll be in Europe for a
month. He must have the
credentials.”

While overseas, Grimes will be
touring Holland, Germany, France,
Belgium and Switzerland. The
mobile squad will play at least the
scheduled 10 games, with more
likely in store.

0 Kent Wittler—The West Dum-
merston, Vt., native is still a ques-
tion mark for Bemis’ '83 roster. He is
a self-proclaimed all-around player,
Bemis revealed, and has played for
Vermont's Select Team.

“I recently asked him the standard
questions,” Bemis added, “like
‘Have you seen any college ball?'and
‘How do you think you'll fare on a
college team?‘ He sounds like a good
walk-on and might make the roster."

0 Peter McCook—Bemis is still
unsure of ’McCook's capabilities,
but will get a better idea once he
views him for the first time during
the summer while obtaining more
notes on Todd Smith.

As docs Smith, McCook hails

School, McCook is also a respectét, ~

lacrosse player and was offered

soccer-lacrosse packages from Wil- -

liam & Mary and Delaware, but
those fell through for one reason or
another.

“Peter heard about Pitt after see-
ing his adviser and putting things in
the computer, I guess,” Bemis said.

“Citing a combination of what he .

wanted to study, what he could pay
and that he wants to play soccer, he
came across Pitt.

“He's apparently a good athlete

and I know West Chester is a good, I

soccer area. I'll try to see him play
when I go see Smith." “

0 Brian Stump-The Kutztown,
Pa., native is Bemis’ only goalie
recruit and will need some rugged
performances during early fall to
edge out the sophomore favorites,
Dave Torrence and James Geraldo.
Bemis is not late to admit that the
upcoming season will be one during
which the Panthers will be tested
heavily and early. Time won't be
wasted as Pitt opens its show ongthe
road and travels to George Mason
and George Washington, Sept. 2

‘ and 3, respectively.

Both are stiff Division I powers.

“We'll probably be quite young at
Midfielder and forward," Bemis.
said, an understatement withstand-
ing. “It may geta little tight this fall
[at those spots], and it will be very
competitive for the starters, but it
also looks good down the road.

“As far as what we'll win or lose, a
lot remains to be seen on our fresh-
men production. That's a lot to say,
but it depends on goal scoring up
front and that one facet of the game
is the most difficult to master in get-
ting a team to win," Bemis said.

Other off-season notables include
the transferring of two players.
Danny Zemanski will have to sit out
a year as he enters his junior year at
North Carolina.

Bemis maintained that the loss of - .-

Zemanski won't hurt the Panthers
position-wise but may with the lead-
ership that was inherent.

“Danny saw a better curriculum
down South," Bemis said, “and is
going to a more high-powered
soccer program. He'll never be a pro
and is a good average college player.

“At North Carolina, though, he'll
be a little frog in a big puddle where-

_ as it would have been the other way I
. around here."

Presently, UNC’s maximum-
scholarship roster boasts three
Parade All-Americas with three
other Parade All-Americas to be
playing as incoming freshmen.

Mike Russell, to be a sophomore,

also transferred, this time to Ameri-S

can University in Washington, D.C.
According to Bemis, the Arlington,
Va., native was disenchanted with

' crowd support, or the lack thereof,

at Pitt. .

Bemis also noted that Russell
wanted to attend a school with lower
tuition. For out-of-state students,
though, American’s base charge of
about $9,000 reveals no discernible
difference when compared to
Pitt's—approximately $8,000.

“He's one individual," Bemis said
of Russell, “who always sees the
grass as greener on the other side of
the fence."

That was one idea that didn't take
Bemis too long to conjure up. Begin-
ning his 30th season in August,
Bemis plans to retire from the col-
lege ranks at season's end.

It would not be anti-climactic to
think that Bemis will be seeking a
fitting note on which to end his
coaching career in avenging last sea-
son's 6-1 3 record, one produced with
an anemic offense.
