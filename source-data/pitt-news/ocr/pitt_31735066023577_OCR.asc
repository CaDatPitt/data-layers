Humanities Program

Evaluated by NEH-  

By MARY KANE ‘

PITT NEWS STAFF WRlTER

C Pitt's new humanities program

received an evaluation this week, as
representatives for the National
‘Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) sampled courses ande‘xam-
ined the program. u ~

The ‘evaluators will issue their
findings shortlybefore Christmas.

The humanities program’ was
developed by Pitt professor Ben-
jamin Bartftwo years ago witha
grant from NEH. Bart,’along with
NEH, selected Jerome B; Schnee-

wind, provost_ofI-Iunter College and ‘

former Pitt dean, and Haskell M.
Block, professor of comparative
literature at the State University of
New York to evaluate the goals he
instituted for the program.

“This kind of evaluation is stand-
ardwith NEH grants,” Schneewind
explained. The, evaluation is based
on the following criteria, according
to Schneewind: J '
—to what extent has the program

demonstrated less concern.
While only 24 percent of the cit-

bage‘ were a ‘ major. ‘problem, in
‘Lower Oakland the ﬁgure was 51
percent. -40 percent of South Oak,-
landers and 27 percent, of North
Oaklanders felt litter was a serious
problem in“their neigh_borho_ . ,
Looking at city servic“ ’ ‘
found that more Lower Oaklanders
felt collection of garbage and trash
was a problem than the rest of the
city. In North and South Oakland,
however, the figures were close to
the city average. ‘ '  r ’

Lothroﬁ Challenge:

BY LYNN FIELDING

Pitt News Staff Writer

The second annual Lothrop
Challenge has been issued and
Amos, Holland, Brackenridge,
McCormick, Forbes, and Towers
A, B and C have accepted.

According to Mike Graeff,

‘Lothrop Hall resident and active

member of the Lothrop Challenge,
“the event originated last year to
stress solidarity between resident
students, so that they could be in
competition yet still doing some-
thing worthwhile.

improve and become more profes-
sional,” he said. The network will
depend heavily on contributions
from the participating schools,
Bower added.

WPGH ‘currently broadcasts
ABC Contemporary Network news,
but Bower said that “networks like
ABC don’t even know college radio
stations exist." He said that the
idea of a network which relies on
college stations, oriented to col-
leges, “bogglescommercial broad-
casters.”

WWSW radio, on ‘the North
Side, is providing studio and other
facilities for tonight’s broadcast.
Bower said. The station is making
is news resources available to CRN
during the experiment, but there
are no other ties between WWSW
and CRN. If an investor is found,
CRN will build its own studios and
offices, -Bower said.

CRN is investigating several
approaches to funding it after the
initial investment is secured,
Bower said. Although tonight’s
broadcast may have sponsors,
when the network includes “Educ-

. ational" stations. it will not be able

“Cooperation in competition is
the idea behind the event to raise
money for various charities,”
Graeff said.

Amos and Holland Dorm Coun-
cils have joined together, calling
themselves “the women of the
quad”. Their charity is Hand-in-
Hand. Some of their fund raisers
include: a hoagie sale, button sale,
soft pretzel sale and a’ dinner-for-
two raffle.

Brackenridge has planned a
tuck-in service and football pools to
raise money for Children’s Hospital
and the United Way.

 

to broadcast advertisements over
these stations.

However, Bower said. they have
devised a unique system to split the
network between commercial and
education stations-allowing non-

commercial material to be sub-

stituted for ‘advertising on the
“educational” stations. All of the
stations involved in tonight’s
broadcast are commercial carrier-

McCormick, whose charity is the
Home for Crippled Children, has
planned a backrub service, break-
fast-in-bed rafﬂe, and Santa Claus
in the Towers lobby.

Tower A has raffles, floor
parties, and a massage parlor
planned to raise money for the
School for the Blind.

Tower B plans to have ﬂoor
parties,- S0/50 rafﬂes, football

general manager of the network.

Five stations will join WPGH for

1975, 39 percent of Oakland resi-
dents felt they lived in a good‘ or
excellent community, compared to
42 percent across the city. Except
for Lower Oakland, the figures have
risen dramatically.

A signiﬁcant difference between

South Oakland and the rest of the

neighborhood emerged in the study.

While the average ‘resident in Lower
and North Oakland lived there for
four years, the average in South
Oakland is 26 years. The citywide

average is 19 years.
The study was a two-year project

jointly sponsored by the School of j
Social _Work and. the University

Center for Social and Urban

Research. About 6,000 households
were interviewed by telephone in
early I980. A » ’
The research was supported by a
grant from the Center for Studies of

_0flered Clollting, Legal Advice

B—y-Scot Stone

The community Human Ser-

' vices Corporation (“the Center”)

of South Oakland, is offering

’ clothing, legal advice, and housing

information for the ' people dis-
placed by the recent Saybrook
Apartment ﬁre.

Over 200 people, many of them
Pitt students, were left homeless
when a ﬁre destroyed the Saybrook
Apartments on Wednesday, Nov.
19." Immediately afterward, the
Center started organizing a relief
effort.

‘fWe have contacted-a number of
local community groups such as
People's Oakland, and the South
Oakland 'Citizen’s Council (SOCC)
to try and get their help, and- the
response has been very .'good,”
said Mike Murphy, Center mem-
ber. _

“We/ 1 were getting so much
clothing_that we had to put a limit
,on donations,” Murphy said.

The clothing willbe available at
the Center's office on 374 Lawn

Street’ until Thursday, Dec.’ 4, or

call 621-4706. .

“We’ve also been trying to _get
housing information for people who

need .it,« and we are making .

available a lawyer for anyone who
feels legal advice is necessary,”7,.g
Murphy said. i‘ ’ 1

The Center has been operating
as an Oaklandcommunity organ-
ization for ten years, and offers a
variety of services from day-care to
health services.

“We have been offering services
to‘ the South Oakland community
for years now. Generally, we have
long-term programs such as our
kindergarten "and day-care pro-
grams, this type of thing is '
important, too. We’ve done this
thing before, and we realize what
it’s like for these,people so we're
trying to help as much as we can,”
Murphy said. ’ ‘

ed at every facet of life in the
perspective of equity. It’s almost a
part of my genes.”

Murray’s zeal for’ justice was
always bringing him in the face of
new challenges, even before his
career as a scholar.

As an undergraduate in
philosophy at La Salle University,
Murray played the piano for a band

“in order to meet college costs. One

day a fellow musician came to Mur-
ray and said he had been accused of

interferring with the rights of a.

booking agent. The musician-
friend had been booked for an en-
gagement at a particular nightclub
and the owner made an unsolicited
request for the musician to return,
which he did without the agent’s in-

- volvement.

“I took a look at the union rules

I (the basis for the booking agent’s

charge) and went before the union
board,” Murray said. “I had never
read the rules before and they
didn’t interest me, but now that we

"had an issue, a problem. It was

essential that this person be defend-
ed. I provided them with an argu-
ment I thought they would find ac-
ceptable, even though prior to that
time they had made a preliminary
decision to withdraw his union
privilege. He was fully reinstated to
the union. Somehow I was always
viewed as the guy who would be

able to say the right thing at the
right time.”

At Catholic University, Murray’s
appetite for legal scrutiny snowball-
ed into yearning hunger by his
graduation in 1958, but he was also
determined to get his doctorate. Be-
fore 1959 was ended, Murray had
it.

Enrolling at the University of
Wisconsin, Murray decided he
would try to enter a program only

taken by bachelors of law with a
number of years practical ex-
perience in which they bypassed
their master’s degree and attained a
doctorate.

“I thought perhaps they would
waive the rule (the prerequisite for
practical experience). It was never
done before and it was rather
presumptuous of me to even suggest
it,” Murray said. “But after I was
there for awhile they said I could
enter the program and ultimately, I
wrote a thousand page thesis.

“They had another rule that said
you couldn't receive your degree
until six months after one year of
residency and they never had to ap-

completed their thesis that early, so
I asked for a waiver of that rule. I
wanted to get my degree because I
wanted to get experience before
beginning my teaching,” Murray
said.

continued from page 0'19

ply the rule because nobody ever,

 

Murray was awarded his doc-
torate but the printers of the
diplomas took about six weeks in
those days to make the diplomas, so
Murray had a clerk type up a
makeshift doctorate diploma on a
bachelor's diploma, crossing out
“Bachelor” and typing in
“Doctor.” _

One of his teachers, who took
note of the ambitious student’s
leaps through the university, saw
Murray on campus, but still in a
suit, after being admitted to the bar
by what looked to be an obviously
forged diploma. Sensing something
was going on, the teacher asked,
“What have you done now?” Mur-
ray explained about the diploma. “I
think I’m happy you’ll be leaving
soon,” the teacher said.

Murray chose not to take the pro-
fessional route because he felt his
ethical mentality could be best ap-
plied through his books and also his
publications as editor of the promi-
nent Journal of Legal Education.

“One of the ways of remedying
the imperfections (in the law) is by
writing law review articles and law
books which will be read by judges
and their clerks,” Murray explain-
ed. “Changes in the law can be
directly traced to my writings.”

One such change came after Mur-
ray wrote three law review articles

concerning a case where a woman
was thrashed by glass when a bank
door she was entering shattered due
to a defect. Under the statute of
limitations the producers of the
door were not liable for the product
after four years of the installation
date and the woman was told she
wouldn’t receive any compensation.

“To me that seemed patently un-
just,” he said. “It’s as if you had a
car that was ten years old and

nothing seemed wrong with it and

you had a passenger in it and the car
exploded because of a defect it had
from the time it was manufactured.
To say to the passenger ‘Too bad
for you’ is ridiculous,” Murray
said, going on to explain that as a
result of his writings, Pennsylvania,
New York and a few other states
had adopted his view into their law.

“Ours is the only system of law
where remedies for imperfections in
the law can be brought about by the
mind of a mangsitting in an office
like this,” Murray said.

_ Unsettling Act

 Amidst Rising
  Violence  

\

PAT bus driver John.Bogden found deserved honor
and commendation for the foiling of a Fifth Avenue

rape attempt. His concern is a reassuring example of

aselfless attitude that, on the whole, is hard to come

by these days. Yet, it seems unsettling that such an
act stands so solitary amidst today_’s -wave of rising
violence. .

Bogden’s thwarting of an attempted rapist on
November 19 warranted front page notoriety because
of his act's atypical nature. Seldom is the prevalent tide
of apathy broken in the way Bogden acted. To find

someone not overly concerned with their own time and .

personal safety is indeed rare, as well as newsworthy.
But this is a rather frightening prospect that may
contain even more frightening results. Society, it
seems, has degenerated majorities of people to the
point of their leading a distant and detached existence.
This numbed passivitiy can only multiply if left
unchecked. Placing this societal phenomenon against
the grand backdrop of all humanity should be quite
enough to open a few eyes to the gravity of our situa-
tion. How long will people “be able to function effi-
ciently once this alientation takes root? How can we
survive knowing. that we can only depend on our-.
selves? And when we become bored enough with our-
selves and the people around us, how much longer will
it take for an extrememly violent, all-encompassing
dog-eat-dog attitude to set in?

("the lﬂitt News

Page 6——Wednesday, December 3, 1980

In March of 1964, The New York Times reported a
story of how 38 people in Queens watched a killer
pursue and stab a woman to death, without coming to
her defense in any way. In May of that same year, the
Times also reported a story of how 40 people
responded to the screams of a woman who was being
raped, but none took any action. These are, of course,
extremes, but they are reflective of a wide-scale feeling.
The attention given to Bogden’s anomaly lends credi-
biltiy _to the drawing of this,conclusion_.

This is not to be construed as minimizing the act of
Bogden. The importance of his act lies not.so much in
waylaying a rape, but in his casting a pedagogical slap
in the fact of affectlessness. Perhaps the day will come
when Bogden’s act, along with many similar incidents,
can take the newspaper space of things commonly
allotted to everyday occurences. When Bogden says, "I
come from a time where no one assaults a woman and
you come to her defense whether you know her or

_ not,” it is helpful to know that we did have a time like

that, and that there arestillpeople from that era who
are working to keep it alivejlf all of us could only
followsuit.

Dear Faculty:

The Pitt News needs your
assistance. The staff at the paper is
committed to serving the university
population. But because of a
shortage of writers. it is becoming
increasingly difficult to provide

articles on diverse subjects that
may be ‘of interest to students.
We also believe that there are
many resources as yet untapped at
the university. We are trying to
remedy this situation.
We would like to solicit your help

°Arnett Uses ‘Cuteness’ to Avoid Depth in Column Writer Says

3

To the Editor:

Once again, Nick Arnett has
used “cuteness” to avoid looking
with any amount of depth into
matters which should be taken
seriously. I was not impressed with
his November 24 column (actually a
rambling editoral) entitled “Like
Clark McClelland, Become an
Expert on Anything.” Of course I

gﬁagree with the viewpoint which

Arnett seems to have, that people
who falsely claim to be experts on
any subject should be scorned.
However, in his usual style of
avoidance strategy, he found a way
to fit the McClelland issue into one
of his “cute” editorials. Instead of
attempting to examine the reasons
behind an individual’s use of lies to
get people to believe that he or she
is an expert on a certain subject,

I Arnett simply took the opportunity

:~'



to mention McClelland, a man who
claimed to be an expert on the
subject of UFOs, as an excuse for
writing a “witty” article about how
one can become an “expert” on
any kind of “nonsense.”

Among the “nonsense” men-
tioned by Arnett were art, history,
biology, medicine and Nazis.
Perhaps some of the things he
called nonsense, such as the
Abominable Snowman and Big
Foot, could almost be classified as
such, since there has been no
concrete evidence of their exis-
tence. But medicine? History?
These things are real, and are very
relevant to our lives and our future.
I cannot understand how anyone

could shrug off the murderous,

Nazis as “nonsense”. World War

\\

 

II was not started by “nonsense,”
but by a force which was very real,
and is still a threat.

There is not one serious sentence
in theentire editorial. Lying about
something as major as McClelland
has is a very serious matter, and
should be treated as such. The Pitt
News is aimed at college students
who "generally have the intellectual
capacity to understand serious
matters concerning society. So just
for whom did Arnett write this
article? It sounds like something
that would be recited on a

merged in an academic world unlike
any I’ve ever known. The faculty,
most of whom had a Ph.D., were
chosen- partly because they had
experience abroad and a profound
enthusiasm for teaching; I spent
many hours with my professors on
the ship, as well as in ports, discuss-

ing our observations and our under- *

standings of our observations as
they occurred.

I think tliat my personal growth
was the most important result of my

experience on Semester at Sea. The‘

world is no longer- just words, for

they now represent not only labels of
political situations, but also stir-feel-
ings of friendship, sorrow, fear and
concern within me. Overpopulation,

starvation and poverty are no longer I

terms in a news magazine, but sym-

bols for situations that .I have‘

walked amongst.

Now that I am home I feel that I
can do something, in some way. to
better unjust situations; my‘ con-

' science will not allow me to go back

to my. old ways, at least not
completely. a \ _

 YORK--Georg'e Rogers.
thercrunching runner who -lifted the

,University of South Carolina into

major college football’s upper
-echelon, capped a true-life rags-to-
riches drama yesterday when he

.,was named winner of 1980

Heisman Trophy as the nation's top

. . player.

The 6-foot-2, 225-pound Rogers, ‘

. ‘who came to South Carolina from a
T «life of poverty in a series of small

Georgia towns and probably will’
become an instant millionaire in
next spring’s' National Football
League draft, seemed happy but
awed and overwhelmed _when he _v

was introduced to the media at the
Downtown Athletic Club, which
annually awards the Heisman
Trophy. O

“I don’t know what to say,”
Rogers repeated several times in
the glare of television lights. “I
just want to thank the coaches and
players. l’m so-proud for my
teammates. It was a shock to me
becuase we were 8-3 and most of
the time it goes to a player from a

‘team with a better record.”

Rogers won fairly decisively over
defensive-end Hugh Green of Pitt

and Herschel, Walker, Georgia’s.

sensational running back whose

third-place finish was the highest
ever for a freshman. '

Rogers received 216 ﬁrst-place
votes, 179 second-place ballots and
122 for third place. With tabulation
based on a 3-2-1 point system, he
totaled 1,128 points. Green had 179
ﬁrsts, 125 seconds and 74 thirds for
861 points while Walker’s score
was 107-120-111--6,83.

Rogers carried four of the six
regions into which the Heisman
voting isdivided--the Mid-Atlantic.
South, Southwest and Far West.
Green took the Northeast while the
Midwest went for Purdue quarter-
back Mark Herrmann, who finished

I

fourth overall.

Rogers led the nation in rushing
with 1,781 yards as South Carolina
compiled an 8-3 record, matching
the most victories in the school’s
history for the second year in a row.
He has gone ‘over 100 yards in 21
consecutive games and stands
fourth on the all-time NCAA
ground-gaining chart with 4,958
yards. Only Pitt’s Tony Dorsett,
Southern Cal’s Charles White and
Ohio State’s Archie Grifﬁn are
ahead of him.

Rogers holds South Carolina’s
school records for_ most yards

rushing in a season and a career

and most points and touchdowns in

‘a season and a career. He is also
Carolina’s all-time total offense
leader without ever having thrown
a pass.

Rogers said the “main thing on
my mind all season was winning. I
wasn’t thinking about the Heisman
Trophy. I just tried to play as hard
as I could. There. was a lot of
pressure and I’ni glad it’s over.”

He praised both Green and
Walker, reiterating his statement
of last week that would have voted
for Green. And he called Walker “a
great "player who has a chance to
win three Heisman Trophies.”

By MARIE HUFF
PITT NEWS SPORTS WRITER
While most of America's eyes
were glued to the football games on
the television screen this holiday
weekend, the Pantherette hoopers
were heading for New Jersey and the
Dial Classic. Pitt lost the opening

. "round game to Villanova, 77-55, but

bounced back to a 79-76 overtime
victory against Wyoming in the con-
solation game. Montclair State
emerged the champions of the two-
daytournament. The Pantherettes
bring a 2-1 record to their home
debut Friday night against Youngs-
to_wn State. ‘

Pitt jumped to an early lead over
Villanova and held it throughout
most of the first 20 minutes. With a
little over one minute to play in the
half, the Lagy Wildcats quickly
turned the tables, sending the
stunned Pantherettes to the locker-
room trailing, 36-30.

The abrupt tournament was
credited, in part, to difﬁculties in
the electrical system, which pre-

“The girls just didn't know where
they stood at the end of the half, in
regards to both the score and the
time remaining,". said coach Judy
Saurer. Also hampering the Pan-
therette attack was a muscle pull
that sidelined sophomore Penny
Welsh in the second half. However,
these distractions could not account
for the lackluster performance
turned in by the Pitt squad in the
second canto, as the Lady Wildcats
outscored them, 41-25. The Pan-

Women  Prepare

By Sean Barnes
What has been termed the best
dual meet on the east coast this
season will be held tomorrow at
Trees Hall pool starting at 3:30

. p.m. and continuing well into the

evening. The meet will‘pit the

, .12-ranked Pantherette swimmers
, -and divers against Michigan and

7 _ North ‘Carolina State, two of the top
~ teams in the nation.

Pitt women’s swim coach Dick

 Bradshaw feels that a challenging
’ meet such ‘as this will produce

times fast enough for some of Pitt’s

swimmers to qualify for nationals

even before Christmas. ,
The Pitt women shouldmake a

1*’ , very strong showing in this opening

meetdue to their strength and
depth, returning with seven All-

 

ing the’ rebounding war by a 43-38
margin. '

Gail Aughburns led Pitt with 14
points. Debbie Lewis chipped in 12
and Pam Miklasevich added 10, but
to no avail. Villanova’s Lisa Ortlip
led all scorers with 17 tallies. Team-
mates Nancy Bernhardt and Kathie
Beisel contributed 16 and 13 respec-
tively for the Lady Wildcats.

Only a slight improvement could
be seen in the Pantherettes’ game the

next. day, but it was enough to
propel them past Wyoming Univer-
sity, 79-76, in overtime. Although
Pitt held a 36-28 halftime lead, a
poor second half allowed Wyoming
to knot the game at 69-69 ‘at the end
of regulation play. The Pantherettes
pulled it out with a l0-7 edge in the
five minute overtime period.

Pitt won the game at the foul line.
Interestingly, Wyoming had a better
free throw percentage (18 of 24), but
they sent the Pantherettes to the foul
line too many times (23 of 37), and
Pitt capitalized. Otherwise, Wyom-
ing held a 29-28 ﬁeld goal edge and
dominated the boards, pulling down
49 rebounds to Pitt's 38.

Debbie Lewis led Pitt with "19
points, 8 rebounds, and l0 steals, all

team highs, ‘ earning her all-
Tournament honors. Lori Dolby
and Penny Welsh contributed 12
apiece, Gail Aughbu'rns added 10.
The Pantherettes’ antagonist, Rita
Makovicka, led Wyoming with 26
points and 16 rebounds. Lisa Hynes
helped out with 19 tallies and Lori
Klipper chipped in 10 points for
winless Wyoming. ,

The Pantherettes will host an
eight team tournament this week-
end, with play beginning on Friday
night. Pitt, the defending cham-
pions, will face Youngstown State in
the opening round. 9

shaw is alsopleased _to see the
incoming freshmen adding
strength to the team where it was
weak. »

“This is the best women’s swim
team ever at Pitt, containing
excellent balance,” said Bradshaw,
“but with the competition being
who they are, the meet may be
decided by as close as one relay.”

Last year, Pitt lost to coach
Isaac's Michigan team in the last
relay, so Pitt women will be
psyched for revenge.

North Carolina State is an
eiccellent sprint team and, being
the visitors, chose the sprint-meet

' format. With Pitt being axgood long

egy will be to try\to win some of the _

has had to work long and hard

This makes the pick of who will

Pitt News Staff Writel""':""‘

Although the Panther booters
ﬁnished their 1980 season on a
disappointing note, ﬁve individual
players earned honors as members
of the Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Soccer Conference
all-stars. Only one of these ﬁve
players will not return to the Pitt
squad, leaving room for much
optimism when the Panthers open
up their indoor season next month.

Two members from the front
line, center forward Bob Hughes
and right wing Eric Tiedtke, a
sophomore, were named along with
midﬁelders Al Adelmann and
Danny Hamm, the lone senior, and
freshman sweeperback Don
Bowen. It was Hamm’s second
consecutive year to be named to the
team.

“We were very happy to have
ﬁve members of the team honored
by the WPISC this season,” said
coach Leo Bemis. “The fact that
four of these are returning for the
indoor season in the winter, and
then again next fall, shows us that
we have a strong nucleus to work
with.”

(Continued from .0089 3)

Pitt’s men’s swim team coach
Fred Lewis said “We can’t afford
to make any mistakes since where
we are strong, so are they.”

Pitt’s Rick Carter, whose name
appears on three team records for
freestyle events, will be up against
N. C. State’s Chuch Gall, who beat
Carter last year for the Eastern
AAU freestyle title. N. C. State also
has the two DeGrunchey brothers
out of Baltimore. Both will prove to
be tough competition for Pitt, with
one of them being the fastest
Individual Medley swimmer com-
ing out of prep school in the nation.

With this in mind, Pitt’s Sandy
Pidgeon will have his hands full.
Pitt should take the breastroke
event with Pidgeon, who holds the
team record at an amazing 2:05.68.
DeGrunchy should be ready for a
battle from Pidgeon in the IM.

“Pidgeon is a workaholic,” said
Lewis, “and if he misses one of his
eleven practices per week, you
know he must be sick.”

Pitt will get strong competition in
backstroke and long-distance free-
style from N. C. State’s Peter

Salsmon, “an excellent back-
stroker,” and Bob Mench, “a very
solid and strong NCAA qualifying
freestyler.”

Also swimming for N. C. State
will be Canadian Pan Am and
Canadian 1980 Olympic team
swimmer Bob Hewitt, who swims
the 200 IM and 200 butterfly. This
will still be an evenly-balanced
meet with both teams not having a
lot of depth, thus making the
competition for those second and
third places a very vitalpart of the
meet.

Lewis said Pitt’s men look very
healthy for this meet. Easterling,
whom Lewis calls the “Johnny”
Majors of swimming,” is also
coming into the meet with a healthy
team, except for what he said was
“a couple dog bites and sore
throats.”_

As for the men's diving, Krug
says that it wil be every bit as
exciting as the women’s diving, if
not more. N. C. State has two men
who qualified for NCAA--Paul
Breitfeller and Ron Posytan.
‘Breitfeller won the South Eastern
Conference on the one-meter board

during his freshman year at
Auburn. Last year as a junior. he

took first at Penn State on they

one-meter board and second on the
three-meter board.

Diving for Pitt will be NCAA
qualiﬁer, Pat Greenwell, “who
may win on both boards against N.
C. State.” said Krug.

“Bob is gaining in confidence
and becoming much, more consis-
tent on the three-meter board,”
said Krug, who is expecting
Lambert to take third.

North Carolina State’s team fell
out of the top 10 in the nation last

year but- are still strong and will’,
the???‘

deﬁnitely be a. factor in
outcome of the combined scores of

diving and swimming. N. C. State
will be going all-out to beat Pitt
since, as their head coach
Easterling, a past Pan Am and
World Championship coach, put it,
“We southern boys don’t like to be

embarrassed.” _
At the conclusion of the meet,

both Pitt and N. C. State will travel
to Penn State Relays to be held
all day Friday and Saturday. Last
year, North Carolina State won
overall.

Individual Honors for Five Panther
Boaters Named to Pa. All-Star Team,

(Continued from page 8)
rest of the league,” said Hamm.
“Next season, and this winter’s
indoor season will find the team in
good shape. Plus most of the other
representatives from other teams
were juniors and seniors. The fact
that our players chosen were a
freshman, a sophomore, and two
juniors shows that we have a strong
nucleus starting to form for an
experienced team next year- If

‘everyone uses‘ the {time and

experience of playing indoor this
winter, it will give them a big
headstart on next fall. It’s so
important to use tournaments and

‘build not only a good indoor team

but a unified outdoor squad.”
The two juniors named to the
team were Adelmann and Hughes.
Bemis believes that these two will
be looked upon next year to lead
the Panthers. Adelrnanmggqored
three goals this season, all coming
in penalty~kick situations. Hughes

scored six goals and assisted on
three others.

“I think that Bob found himself
as a scorer this year and built a lot
of confidence along the way,” said
Bemis. “I look for him to return
next season and be very effective.
A] will certainly be looked to for
continuing his leadership,” added
Bemis. “We will probably go more
to his defensive strengths, rather
than. his offense- He has always
had a steady performianceivaiid I
look for him to have another ﬁne
year next season.”

Tiedtke, the sophomore wing,
was the leading scorer for the
Panthers this season with seven
goals and three assists. Tiedtke
was also named the mid-Atlantic
regional Player of the Week for his
performance in the Pitt-Penn State
game in late October. A freshman

from Canada, Bowen added a great

deal of ‘maturity to the young
Panther squad. Although it was his

ﬁrst year to play collegiate soccer,
Bower, at 21, stepped into the
sweeperback position and adjusted
very well to the new area.

' “Both Eric and Don, at two
opposite ends of the ﬁeld, did a fine
job for us this season,” said Bemis.
I think that Eric will improve even
more and score more next season.
Hehas shown that he can do that
from his ﬁrst year to his second,
and I'm sure that he will do well
again. Don made a good showing
as a ﬁrst-year man, and he too
should progress and grow and
become a very effective part of our
program.” - ‘

The Panthers will begin practic-
ing, barring any problems, next
month. Pitt fared very well in last
season’s indoor competition, and
having‘ lost no one from that time.
with the exception of Hamm. they
are looked to repeat another

successful season.
