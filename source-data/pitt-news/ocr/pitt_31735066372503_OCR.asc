Grants Changed

Pitt students will have to be

more careful in filling out Pell
Grant applications, since major
changes are being made in the
Pell Grant application
procedures.
g Secretary of.Education T.H.
Bell announced recently that he
hopes to implement a system
that will serve to verify the accu-
racy of student financial
disclosures. ‘

Bell said that the results of a
study revealed gross overpay-

 

applications was accepted on
good faith, Bell was quotedas
saying. v ‘ '

According to Mike Vozza, a
Pitt financial aid officer, the
results of, the study are not
surprising.

Vozza estimated there is an
error rate of up to 50 percent on
the applications, but attributed
a majority of the errors to over-
sights or miscalculations.

Vozza said he”doesri't foresee
any immediate adverse effects
on Pitt students as a resultof the
proposed changes, but said any
cutback will increase a student’s
financial burden.

Faculty Want Involvement In Decisions  

By LARRY LEDERER ‘

Pitt faculty members said there is
a need to improve faculty involve-
ment in university..decision mak-
ing at Friday’s Senate Council
meeting.

Engineering Professor Wesley
M. Rohrer, the president of the
University Senate, saidthat the
university has not yet begun to
approach ‘truly collegial
management. i

Richard Thorn, an economics
professor who heads the American
Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP) agreed that more

faculty-administration communi-

cation is needed. »
The AAUP released a statement
' that said faculty members are offic-
S ers of the university and are respon-
sible for establishing university
policies. p
“More and constant ad-
ministration-faculty communica-
tion is needed to enhance
university decision making,”
Thorn said. ‘.‘For example,
although we have an;exceptional
dean in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, he is in the impossible
position of having 40 persons

report to him. No administration
can work effectively with that kind
of situation.” '
According to the AAUP state-
ment, what results from this is an
almost “total breakdown” in the
normal channels of communica-
tion between faculty and chairmen,

deans, the provost and the highest
councils of the university. a
The statement said‘ the faculty
has no idea what the objectives and
priorities of the university are, and
that the deans are scarcely better

informed.

ikccording to Dr. Richard Pratt,

It’s not just cold, it’s freez-

Attend Retreat

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

i

The new members of the Student
Government , Board attended a
retreat this weekend to‘ learn var-
ious aspects of student leadership
and to become acquainted “with
each other. -

The retreat was held at the Har-
ley Hotel in Monroeville and was
sponsored by the university.
According to assistant student
activities director, ‘Joyce 1 Gian-
garlo, the cost of the weekendjwas
approximately $1,300. Last year’s
retreat cost nearly $2,000 of student
activities money.

Giangarlo said the difference in
price was partly due to the fact that
the chairpeople of the standing

committees were not in attendance, ‘

asjthey were last year. The costs
included the renting of rooms and
meals-

Giangarlo said"the event would
have lost much of its effectiveness if
it had been held on campus.

“On campus there are tooiriany“.

distractions,” she said. “It
wouldn’t have been too productive
if it would have been held on
campus.’.7 I

Most of the "board members
echoed Giangarlo’s opinion, ‘say-
ing that being forced to spend a‘
weekend together helped them to‘
get to know one another. .

“I think we‘needed to get away ‘

from the campus,” Linda O’Con-
nor said. “We were together day
and night, so we got to know each
other’s habits.”

O’Connor said that the members
had to share a room with somebody

they did not know very well and she A

said that experience in itself will
help during the course of the year.
“It’s important to knowthese lit-
tle habits before we start making
policies,-” she said. .
Spencer Davis agreed that th
program needed to be off campus
in order for the board members and
the allocations committee to get to
know one another personally.

leads a double life and loves it. '

livery weekend she drives
home to Johnstown, Pa. to
work both behind the scenes
and on camera at the local tele-
vision station, WJAC-TV.

‘‘I started at WJAC in the
summer of 1980 in the control
room. I returned the next
summer and I just didn’t want
to stop, so they said if I could
manage the trip that I could
continue there on weekends,”
she said.

Grzybicki does the weather
forecast (twice on Saturdays and
once on Sundays), goes out in
the field for news reporting,
edits the videotapes and works
in production.

"It’s funny," she reflected. “I
applied to several places and
never expected to be hired by
WJAC. It was a summer job and
I was a summer replacement-
working in the control roo ,
running the projectors, run-
ning the audio board and just a
lot of things.

“You wouldn’t believe the
control room,” she said. “It’s
filled with constant activity and
there’s never a dull moment,
which is probably why I loved
it—especially the people run-

« ning around and the intensity
of the minutes before airtime.

“Anyway, everyone knew
that I was interested in report-
ing. I didn’t have any expe-

rience in front of theacamera,

when l was asked if I would like
to audition for the job, I was
stunned. Three days later, I had
the job.”

Anything can happen—and
does——in the fast-paced
medium of television where
seconds count. Grzybicki, too.
had had her share of surprises.

“In television, you learn that
if you want to eat, you eat in the
car——-something I’m not good
at,” she said. “One time, on the
way to interview a congress-
man, I was drinking a coke,
tipped it to drink it, and spilled
it on my blouse, not a crisis
except in television.

“I asked the cameraman if the
stain was too bad and while he
was looking the car in front'of
us stopped and we almost hit it.
The cameraman was excited,
saying things like, ‘I'm going to
tell everyone that we almost
wrecked because you wanted me
to look at your chest!’

“Well, he did, and we made
“Office Chatter,” the WJAC—
TV newsletter."

While we are sittingat home
on the couch being entertained
by the tube, Grzybicki has a
much - different view of the
situation.

“You see scenery that fits in

as part of your living room;
cozy. We, on-the other hand, see '
two or three large cameras, and

very hot bright lights.

Gryzbicki also has to worry
about details that most viewers
never notice--unless some-
thing goes wrong.’ I I

“I worry about tangling the
microphone cord, or whether I
can make it to the map while
the temperatures are on the
screen,” she said. “I used to
worry about the ad-libbing

Draft

2 Demonstration
  Today

A idemonstration against
President Reagan’s reversal of -
his pre-election statement
opposing draft registration will
be held today at noon outside
the Federal building, down-
town. ;

Reaganhad said that “draft
registration destroys the very
values that our society is com-
mitted to defending.”

According to the American‘

before the forecast and trying to
look natural when all eyes were
on me. But, you do develop a
feel for it and really, you have to
be yourself."

Days are always hectic at the
station, but Grzybicki said she
thrives on the intensity. There
are times when she is putting
together a story and the weather
a few minutes before air, going
up to the roof to get the temper-
ature, then running down to
edit a story, then back to get the
weather map.

Jessica Savitch is one jour-
nalist whom Grzybicki thinks is
“incredible." But she admires
the people she works with more
because she sees them work.
Another influence in her life
has been Marino Parascenzo, a
visiting journalism professor
from the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

“He brings practical advice
into the classroom and
demands nothing less than the
very best," Grzybicki explained.
“Listening to the person you
are interviewing is important
and I was taught that you can
never just dash something off-
which is hard to avoid if you
work in television.” .,

Grzybicki sid that she is eager
to work at WJAC-TV after she
graduates and that she hopes to’
do even more reporting in the
field. .

Sure, there are days when she
says she does not feel like doing
it. “But, you can’t let the mis-
takes rattle you," she said. “And
you learn to cope even if thereis
a fly buziing in front of your
face or you say the completely
wrong thingt——-the show must
go on, and I wouldn’t have it
any other way." ‘

Faculty Involvement in Decision Making Discussed

Page 4-

continued from page one
to achieve is not being met.

Pratt said that administrators
regard governance as a service, but
that they ought to be encouraging,
inspiring and articulating univer-
sity policy.

Faculty responsibility should
center around the concern for stu-
dents, openness, and welcoming
leaders, Pratt said.

“This collegial ideal is not
necessarily unattainable,” Pratt
said. “We should try to pursue this
idea.

“Administration responsibili-
ties are to lead, not control. Our
hopes, then, are for faculty and
administration infrastructures to
continue to build the university
community as a collegial one.”

FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg
cited examples where he said
faculty participation and gover-
nance do exist.

“Establishing curriculum,
admission proceedings, degree
requirements, and definition of
topics on scholarly research are all

areas in which faculty members

have complete control,” Rosen-
berg said. “Therefore, the faculty
does control the major portion of
activity within the university.”

Rosenberg added, however, that
on—difficult decisions, a consensus
would be hard to achieve.

Philip Wion, president of the
Pitt Professional Union (PPU),
which recently merged with the
AAUP to form the United Faculty,
said the answer to the problem of
governance could be found in col-
lective bargaining. According to
Wion, under collective bargaining,
a contract would exist having con-
crete terms grounded in law.

Resolution of disagreements, on
which, Wion said, administration
always had theglast word, would be
arbitrated by a third party mutally
chosen by the administration and
faculty.

“More than 737 higher learning
institutions have chosen collective
bargaining,” Wion said. “Pitt will
hopefully soon be one of them.”

According to the AAUP state-
ment, the major responsiblity for
strengthening collegiality within
the university lies with a major

' reform in the administration.

The reform would restore the
two—way flow of information, mak-
ing the administration better
informed of faculty views and the
faculty better informed of the alter-
natives open to the administration.

Reforms proposed in the state-
ment include:

0 It is “Imperative” that chair-
men meet regularly with their
faculties to solicit views and
inform them of university policies
that effect them, and that the uni-
versity deans meet collectively with
their chairmen to formulate poli-
cies for their schools.

0 It is also clearly important that
the chancellor and provost meet

collectively with their deans and

departmental heads both to be

informed of collegial concerns and
to inform the faculty of the policy
alternatives available, perhaps
making themselves available for
the consideration of new
alternatives.

OThe statement proposes that a
rotation of faculty members in and
out of administrative posts would
be beneficial. This would prevent
the polarization of faculty and
administration that is taking place.

Thorn said the University Senate
is the major channel by which
faculty opinion becomes part of the
decision-making process.

“We need the University Senate,
and we must strengthen it,” Thorn
said. “The newly formed United
Faculty has merit in that the

faculty can speak with a united

participation, building C()nSt‘nSus,ﬁ‘

voice, yet, it cannot take the place
of an effective senate."

According to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, who said he attended the
meeting as a “careful listener,”
there can never be enough dialogue
on administration-faculty
relations.

“We are not a hierarchical
organization on academic matters,
though we are perhaps in certain
budgetary, financial, and manage-
rial matters,” Posvar said. “We are
a collection of colleagues.

“The administrations central
purpose is to facilitate the educa-
tional process and literally serve
the faculty in achieving that aca-
demic mission. So we seek faculty

and strive for openness.

“Collegiality is the characteristic
that an instituton of higher learn-
ing should be built upon.

Thorn pointed out that there is a
general agreement among all the
speakers in that there are high lev-
els of faculty participation one way
or another.

“Differences exist in liow it
should be improved,” Thorn said.
“We are not trying to usurp the
administrations leadership role.

"That session taught us how to
set goals in a reasonable fashion
and be realistic about what can be
accomplished,” Veronis said.

Davis and Veronis praised the

facilitators of the program saying
they seemed to be very professional
and handled the sessions effec-
tively. 'O’Connor, however, said
she was not totally pleased with
them.

“I think they were graduate stu-
dents who were trying to be coun-

selors,” she said.

SGB president"I‘odd DeLuca
said that the weekend was benefi-
cial to him because he did not
know some of the people of the
board prior to the election.

“I got_ a feel on how they would

DeLuca, who attended the
retreat as a board" member last year,
said the only difference was that
they had less free time this year, the

Giangarlo said she thoughtithe
tnost effective session was the one
on risk taking. She said that the

by strong support groups were told
that they owe a duty to other stu-
dents as well.

“I think they learned that even
though a group put them there
they can't put all theirallegiances

Starting Over  

The inauguration of Todd DeLuca as
Student Government Board president this

V week ushered in another of'a never-ending.
series of “eras of optimism” for Pitt student
government and the students it represents

, on th Oakland campus. As is expected from
someone in such a newly-elected position,
DeLuca is expressing unbridled enthusi-

"asmand optimism as he embarksuponhis
quest to make 1982 the best year ever for
student government. I _ . '

Although in office foriless than a week," '
DeLuca now» faces the pivotalpoint;-gtof his
term as SGB president. ‘It is a pointthat is
most enviable, for the possibilities that
standbefore him are boundless. But it is a

. point that finds him most vulnerable to the
internal politicking and outside pressures

I that naivete’ in such a position can foster.
From this point on, it will be either a
smooth, successful ‘program or an uphill
battle fraught with disagreement, discord
and underachievement.

In a recent interview, DeLuca talked -
about his responsibility as official spokes-
man for the student body. But he also real-
izes the importanceof not alienating him.-
self from the board--cl1oo‘sing.:to continue
in a cooperative role rather than that of an
arbiter or overseer. During his campaign,
he hammered hard on the faculty evalua-
tion issue and plans to make it a major goal

for his administration. While‘ there are
other diverse issues and problems facing the
board, DeLuca will probably be ‘most
remembered if he accomplishes his impor-

I tant goa.l rather than trying to haphazardly
deal with every small problem and accomp-
lish nothing. 4 r
“ Most importantly, DeLuca is aware of
what happens when personality conflicts
and infighting draw the emphasis away
from the primary goalsof the SGB. On the
night__.eof- the election tally last month. De-
Luca witnessed the grumblings of some
board members about the personalities of
some of their _-colleagues. DeLuca maintains
he will not tolerate these actions. "its my
responsibility to clear the board of person-

i ality cla-sl‘:res,’v’ he said. “I’m going to. facili-

Ntate a .profe1ssional—typeattitude, not a
personality one. -We have to re.-memberthat
our job is to work for the good of our
students.” ' g . »

Todd DeLuca’s electionlast term was an
indication that the student body believes in
his abilities and positive attitude. We hope
he is able to keep his optimism and enthusi-

asm unbridled while facing the many prob-

. lems and pratfalls the year will bring. If he
succeeds, he may not only become a land-
mark president, but will restore the interest
and dignity that is so’important to the suc-
cess of the SGB.

ts on Pol

That Continues... I

By TIMOTHY KEARNEY

It has been nearly one month
since the military declared a state of
war in Poland. While we in the
Western  Hemisphere are more
accustomed to describing the situa-
tion as martial law, I feel that the
Polish nomicker fits the situation
better. The military, supported by
the neo-Stalinist elements in the

party," has occupied the nation and ‘

placed it under seige. The nation
was turned overnight into an iso-
lated camp, run by the military.
Si.r1ce ‘that, time, "many Western
responses and comments have
flooded the media, each with an
explanation or solution to the
situation. The most‘ popular view-
point has been that this has been a
Polish answer to a Polish problem.

What I think we have been
preoccupied with is a ‘Unified

.Western response” and seeing the

problem in a ideological corner—
the left claims that compared to

South America and other parts of ~
. the world,.the Polish “crisis” is

really nothing. The right sees it as

. another “proof that socialism can-

not work. ,
To the right, the reply is rather

I ‘easy. There has never been and

never will be soc-ialism in countries
whose "“‘socia'?list» character”was
imposed by Stalin and whose party
is an offshoot of the Stalinist party
which rigged _the elections and
imposed itself on a war-weary
populace. ’

It seems offensive to me that the

‘ Polish situation could be used'by

some groups to prove their own
ideology. The National Rifle Asso-
ciation's response to the crisis was
to issue a letter which said, in

effect. that all this could be avoided

, if Poles had guns. The people

responsible for the letter should
lookback to the Warsaw Uprising
of I945, when the residents of War-
saw tried an armed rebellion
against. the retreating Gcrrnari

I Army. If the NRA had ever seen the

‘effects of people arrned with guns
against tanks, cannons, airplanes
and all the other tools of modern
warfare, if it had seen the pictures
of a \\'ar‘saw 95 pcrccnt destroyed, it
would realilc what this really
meant and cease to hand out its
poison.

Wliat has happened in Poland is

. not the heavy hand of socialism

starnpirig out the “class which it is
supposed to r'cpr'csciit". It is
iristcad another‘ socialist move-
iircirt,c;ille(l Solidarriosc’, starnpcd
out by the l)os.sc.~. instead wliosc
very cxistcncc it tlir'c;rtciicd. l'nfor‘-

* iurratcly. I believe that if a move-

ment like Solidarity arose in this
country.‘ and questionetl the exis-
tence of capitalism and the major
‘parties. a very similar rcsiilt..woirld

be seen in our own streets.

The left poses a different prob-
lem. While the scope ofthe Polish
situation perhaps doesn’t go as far
as the drama being played out irrlil
Salvador or South Africa, Icannot
see how that makes a difference.
These workers and intellectuals in
Solidarity are their cultural kins-
men: denouncing capitalism and
imperialism, victirnized by brutal
regimes. A Marxist acquaintance
of mine demanded that I produce
“evidence” of the camps and deaths
in Poland, Perhaps this is the cru-
cial difference. Poland's leaders
have chosen to cut themselves off
from the world. No matter what
one believes, it is beyond compre-
hension that a government could

‘cut off any

worldf If we are to believe eyewit-
nesses, police with dogs come to
people's homes in the middle of the
night to take them to camps, one of
which is said to an old Nazi con-
centration camp.

The brutalized Poles -will sur-
vive. Their nation is accustomed to
being stomped on, divided up, even
erradicated and wiped from the

v map. Even now, part of Poland is

under the guise of belonging to the

of General Jaruzelski, the Reagan

major goals: to lessen Soviet con-

Poland is not under Soviet cori-

started soon after the I939 Nazi-
Sovict pact. At Yalta FDR and
(lhurchill were able to wr‘est_lc out
of Stalin a comrnitnicnl to free elec-
tions, once the war was over in
Poland. Viewing the recent attack
on Solidarity, those
obviously never came about.

shoot cold in 2nd half  

was supplied by a tough Rutgers
squad as much as the Panthers-own
ragged play, in the second _half.

Time and time again, after des-
perately clawing, scratching, and
fighting back into the game, the
Panthers would revert -back to the
ragged play that initially got them
behind in the scoring. For exam-
ple: .
0 Chip Watkins would miss four
of five foul shots after making good
plays to get to the charity» stripe.

O Pitt would turnover the ball to
Rutgers after stealing sttccessfully
just seconds earlier.

,0 Pitt would hit only eight of 14
foul shots in the "second half.

_i Rutger’s Kevin Black, an icy cool
guard, despite general chaos-on his
team, hit jumper after jumper,
which didn’t help matters either.
for Pitt. ,

Black, who scored 16 points——14
in the second ha1f——was forced to’
take control of the game after Pitt
had done an effective job shutting
down Rutgers’ one—two combina-
tion of Clarence Tillman and Roy
Hinson in the second half.

Pitt Coach Roy Chipman had no
choice but to concentrate his team’s
attention on the two Rutgers’
giants. In the first half, the duo

man center Andr.e Williams, who
came off the bench to sink four of
five shots from the field.

7 Why, Dwayne Wallace hadn't
even gotten warmed up yet, and
Clyde Vaughan was just beginning
to find his scoring touch range at

the end of the half.
And, Chipman made some.

adjustments. Hinson would only
score three points in the second
half while Tillman could muster
but five. But Chipman’s own team
along with a couple of Scarlet
Knight guards didn’t cooperate
offensively.

“The poor star-t at the second
half hurts us, as did the missed foul
shots,” Chipman would say later.
After a second look at the stat sheet,
he added, “Kevin Black hurt us

too.”

Indeed, instead of coming out for
the second half the way they left off,
the Panthers cou1dn’t buy a basket.
Rutgers, meanwhile, was slowly

pullingiaway and the halftime tie»

turned into a 10 point Rutgers
advantage early in the second half.

Thrives

By SEAN BARNES

o

Geoff Emore, a tall, lanky
sophomore computer science
major, is one of the powers-to-
be on], the awesome Pitt swim
team as it strives for its seventh
straight Eastern title. Emore’s
first season at Pitt was a tough
one that was marred by the
team’s two losses, one to Indi-
ana and one to North Carolina
State. '-

At Pitt, two loses are rare——
Pitt is 51-7 over the last six
seasons—but the two losses
against such fast opponents
resulted in some quick times for
both Emore and his teammates.

Emore had Eastern qualify-
ing times in both meets in the
200-yard backstroke that
prompted Panther head swim
coach Fred Lewis to say, “He
will be one of our main powers
in both the water as a back-
stroker and butterflyer, and on.’
the deck as a psych builder
when things get rough.”

For Emore, swimming
became his sport-for-life years
ago in Japan. While Emore was
in first and second grades he
was required to take swimming
at his school. Emore’s natural
' talent showed quickly: in an
end-of-the-year race, Emore
won the first-place plaque. He

was eight.
Once ‘back in the states,
' Geoff, his older sister and

- younger brother swam avidly,
but not as much as other swim-
ming: champions. Emore had
perrideas how good he could be

Emore, “going from high

Emore had received meet sta-
tistics and information about
Pitt's program from Lewis dur-
ing his senior year at Council"
Rock High School , a bit north-
east of Philadelphia. Emore
had not done well in the state
finals in his junior year‘, but he
placed fourth in the l00—yard‘
butterfly as a senior, despite

having had to undergo an’

appendectomy in early season.
Lewis was looking hard for

Gymnastswin with a Wince

The~Pitt Lady Panther gymnas-
tics team overcame a slew of injur-
ies Saturday. to post their first
‘victory of the season,’a tri-meet win
over visiting New Hampshire and
Temple.

Pitt, last year's No. 2-ranked
Eastern team, outpointed No. 3
New Hampshire, 134.75-133.15.
Temple 'finished a distaht third
with l2l.75 points.

Leading the way for the Lady
Panthers with Pitt‘s claim to fame
in gymnastics, nationally-ranked
sophomore Lisa Shirk. Shirk, des-

ankle, won the all-around compe-
tition with a score of 36.00. Her
scores of 9.4 on the uneven bars and
9.25 in the vault were also good for
first-place finishes.

Karen Martin, Shirk’s room- _
mate, also overcame an injured - i ’
ankle that has bothered her since
late November, to take third in the
all-around competition with a 33.3
score. In the balance beam event,
Maftin’s 8.35 score was a welcome
stabilizer for the Pitt team, which
was slightly “off-balance” on the
beam. Many of the Lady Panthers
were trying new routines in meet
competition for the first time.

Other-top finishers for the Lady
Panthers were seniors Regina Car-
son and All-East performer Holly
Martino, one of the few relatively
healthy gymnasts on the team.
Martino, a consistent all-around
performer, tied for third in the
vault and Carson took fourth place

Gretchen Speich, one of the many aching girl gymnasts,

nevertheless went through with her routines. .

expected to handle the bulk of
the rebounding.

Granted, the team is not a
world beater when it comes to
height. Nevertheless, certain
players have shown the ability
to rebound well, notably fresh-

men Chip Watkins and Andre
Williams.

So what do you do? After all
the team is 8-3, and you can't
push the panic button after one
recent loss. Absolutely, no
panic button is being pushed.
But as the Panthers go into the
meat of their Eastern 8 sche-
dule, scoring from the other for-
ward spot as well as the center
spot will become crucial.

The center spot, as meiiti-
oned before, is lacking. Steve
Beatty often looks confused and
tentative as a center. Beatty, in
fact, is playing out of position.
Beatty, a good shooter on the
wing when facing the basket, is
suited more for a forward spot.

So is
Williams.

But the latter has shown the
instincts for the center spot.
Williams can effectively get his
shot off in traffic with his back
to the basket. His offensive
rebounding has been very good-
I tideed, he seems to have a better
grip on how to play inside.

freshman Andre

So why not flip-flop the two.
Start Williams at center and
Beatty at the other forward spot.
Williams could bring more
offense to the position while
Bcatty, taller than Kirby, possi-
bly could take some of the
reboundiiig slack off \’aughan.

The insertion of Williams is
actually the chief benefit of
such a switch. The freshman

game, Williams went in with

first half and later started the
second half.

Pitt is still 8-3 however, and

in recent time. But when only

Virginias will not lose to teams

A shakeup may be in order.

Andre Williams’ play has made it verv hard for Roy
Chipman to keep him off the floor.

makes you play defenses which you
aren’t accustomed to playing,”
Rutgers Coach Tom Young said of
Pitt’s fate.

Pitt installed a full court press.
Players went flying, bodies fell to
the floor and the ball was kicked,
mishandled and left rolling unat-
tended in the melee. The press, and
some panicking by- Rutgers,
brought the Panthers back-back
to within teasing distance, that is.

“It was very frustrating because
every time we.came back they'd
make a spurt. It may have gotten to
the team. Maybe they got tired,”
Chipman said. Twice Pitt came to
within three points and twice
Kevin Black hit a jumper. Once the

Panthers could have come within
one, but Watkins missed both free
throws.

A team can only keep on coming
back for so long, and in the end
Rutgers’ foul shooting, which was
an incredible’ 90.5 percent for the
game, sealed the win.

The Pitt men’s diving team,
depleted by the loss of its top two

divers, is offering tryouts to divers‘ .

with high school, club or collegiate
experience.

The Panther team, defending
Eastern champions, lost last sea-
son’s top performer, Pat Green-
well, to graduation; the squad also
lost current top performer, junior
Mike Minik, to injury and aca-
demic problems. Earlier this sea-
son, promising freshman Shawn
McLain injured his knee in train-
ing, and then decided to transfer to
William and Mary college in order
to be closer to home.

If you’re interested in trying out,
contact Pitt diving coach Junian
Krug at x1724 between 1-3 p.m.
Krug, one of the East’s top coaches,
has produced four
champions-—the maximum
possible--in his first two seasons
here at Pitt. Before entering coach-
ing, Krug was a two-time world

“I like the way Fred not only
picks out things wrong with
swimmers’ strokes or turns or
starts. He also goes so far as to
make you feel bad enough
about it to correct the error on
the very next set. That’s what
makes champions—c0ntin-
uous, daily improvement,”
Emore said.

Emore said the Panther
team’s unity explains why Pitt
has remained the Eastern power
it has for so many years.‘

“Our team is much like a fra-
ternity or cult. We know each
other very well and know what

» each other can be expected to do
in a meet situation,” Emore
said. ‘-‘Swimming is a very indi-
vidual sport once you hit the
water, that is, once I leave the
block, it’s up to me and only me

, our own strategies for our own
events. But out of the water we
are very much a team. Again
there is a strategy here that

coach of the year the last three
years,” noted Emore.

Emore’s feeling for the team
idea may come from his
summer activities. He coaches
the Summerton Springs Age
Group team back home, a team
well respected inlthis area.

Wjth the Penn State-Pitt
swim meet looming ahead Sat-
urday, Emore didn’t hesitate to
speculate on the outcome.
“With the loss of our top diver,
we'll be pushing hard to win
the opening and closing events,
both being relays. (Both events
are worth seven points for first
place and none for second or
below.) Fred will be sure to put
us through a maximum
amount of sprinting this week.
It wouldbe good to beat PSU
because we’re on the road three
consecutive weekends——PSU,
LaSalle and then WVU." After
two weeks of rest, Pitt travelsto
take on one of the two teams it
lost to last year-Indiana.

Because ‘of her team’s injury
prob-lile"rhs,-it the quality of the New
Hampshire team, and the new rou-
tines the.Lady Panthers were using
for the first time in competition,
Pitt’ coach Donna-Sanft was unsure
what to expect in the meet. The Pitt
team’s dominating win was a
pleasant surprise to the coach.
“I ‘thought the meet would be
closer. I thought we’d be measur-
ing in tenths of points down to the
very last event.” Sanft said after-
wards. “It was really encouraging
to see the girls not making mis-
takes. That’s what really made the
meet.” '

1- Sanft added that the Lady Pan-
thers’ early-season condi-tioning
work, which the team began at the

_ start of Christmas break, also pro- 

vided an edge in the meet. The
team will need to be in superb
shape as it plunges into a busy
‘four-meet schedule this Vmonth,

beginning next week at the Univer-

sity of.Maryland.

While the-rest of the Pitt team
takes to the road, Shirk will stay
behind to recuperate from ankle
surgery she'll undergo Wednesday.
The sophomore will miss at least
three weeks. IneSaturday’s meet,
Shirk competed with the painful
bone spur, but was forced to water
down some of her -routines.
Although Shirk won three events,
she agreed that her performance
was hampered by the ankle injury.

“It especially hurt when I needed
my ankle the most,” Shirk said and
laughed. ,

‘ But, like the rest of the team, it’s
easier to hear when you're
winning.
