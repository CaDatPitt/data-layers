6 to 10 inches of snow expected

News Editor _'

Students screamed from their win-

dows and shouted in the Schenley
Quad last night when they found out
that Pitt canceled classes for the sec-

ond day in a row.

The University announced shortly
before 6 p.m. yesterday that it would
cancel today’s classes. Unlike Sunday
night, it usedboth its website and the
emergency notiﬁcation system to tell
students of the change.

Essential personnel, such as
cleanup crews, still had to report to
work today.- .

“We urge all members of the
University to exercise caution and
to make safety their top priority,” read
a message on Pitt’s website.

University administrators said on
the website that they made decision
because the city’s public safety direc-
tor suggested they close and because
meteorologists expect another storm
to arrive this morning.

Pitt also sent out an e—mail last
night announcing the cancellation
of this week’s Career Fair, which was
scheduled to take place Wednesday
and Thursday.

» Pitt is in the process of setting up

other fair in the ﬁiture, the e—mail
said. .

City joins county, state in declaring disaster emergency

Snow day 4 1

Service meteorologist, said a storm
coming from the south should hit
Pittsburgh around mid—morning to-
day and could have an impact “just as
great” as this weekend’s. The service
issued a winter storm warning that
will begin at 10 a.m. today and last
until 7 p.m. tomorrow. -_

The storrnwill drop about 2 inches
of snow throughout the day and an-

other 3 to 4 inches during the night.
Snow willpcontinue into Wednesday
and possibly into Thursday, bringing
the total accumulation to between 6
and 10 inches, Giordano said.
“Considering the road crews are
still cleaning up from the last one,
the impact could be just as great for
this one as for the last one,” he said.
“Any of the problems you already

had, they’re just going to be com-
pounded.”

City Council declared a disaster
emergencyyesterday. The declaration
allows city officials to buy snow—re-
moval supplies andhireextraworkers

more quickly than it normally could. A

This followed similar declarations by
the county and state this weekend.
“There are over 1,200 miles of

narrow and sloped city streets that
need attenﬁon. That is the equivalent
of plowing snow from here to Miami.
Add in 20 inches of snow, downed
trees and power lines and you have a
disaster that takes time to clean upj’
City Council President Darlene Harris
said in a news release.

Giordano said temperatures will
probably stay below freezing until at

least next week. Pittsburgh could get i

more snow showers this weekend.

EDITORIAL

Research on  
the’Tube

nformation comes in many

shapes and sizes. E-mail,

text, video, audio, print,
journals and papers are just a few
vehicles of conveyance.

People do not prefer these
methods equally. Often, the elec-
tronic wins over the tangible.
Electronic information is more
versatile, more portable and of-
ten, quicker.

One can pull up an article or
e-mail within seconds on a vari-
ety of smart phones, laptops and
other gadgets.

And under the electronic um-
brella, video is a favorite. There
is something to view and some-
thing to listen to. Just look how

pervasive television is on the Pitt" _

campus.

YouTube is everyone’s televi-
sion. It doesn’t matter what kind
of ﬂat screen or video player you‘
have, YouTube is always there as
a backup, and often a primary
source, for viewing your favorite
clips. It’s the common man’s TV.

The University of Maryland
understands the mass audience
that YouTube garners and is har-
nessing this audience for pur-
poses outside of entertainment.
Stephen Kinsey, the technology-
licensing officer for the univer-
sity’s department of commercial
ventures and intellectual proper-
ty, wanted to connect researchers
to businesses interested in their
inventions on a‘YouTube channel
they created. The short videos
depict the researchers explaining
their work.

Such a venture is an enrich-
ing opportunity for universities
and does not have to necessarily
include potential business. This
would be accomplished with the
proper licensing policies the in-
stitution holds. Pitt, being the
research goliath it is, has this
potential.

Professors who want to par-
ticipate could create videos of

themselves explaining their re-
search on a YouTube channel. The
purpose is not for business, but
for more dialogue and familiar-_
ity between each faculty member
and the rest of the University. Stu-
dents would readily realize what
their professors’ lives are about
outside of lecture.

This kind of communication
traditionally involves reading
a professor’s publishedarticles
to better understand his or her
professional interests. How-
ever, reading a 30-page paper
engrossed in the details of the
neuron’s cell membrane, although
essential, is no easy task. And it
does not offer the reader a real
look at the,re'searcher as a person,
like a video would — although
face-to-face communication
would be ideal.

The disciplines that such cov-
erage could include are limitless.
The research does not have to be
in the natural sciences only, but
the humanities and arts as well.
Students and other faculty will get
an interdisciplinary perspective
of the campus. Even residents of
Pittsburgh will have a better un-
derstanding why,‘ for example, Pitt
ranks in the top 10 institutions re-
ceiving funding from the National
Institute of Health, neck-to—neck
with Johns Hopkins University,
Harvard University and the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.

q ‘ Another beneﬁt of such a pur-
suit would be, that potential un-
dergraduate researchers could
better gauge the interests of
faculty theyewant to work with.
Nothing replaces a good litera-
ture review, but a video makes
thetask a little easier and a little
more fun.

The advances technology has
made are well known. There is
tremendous potential in using
popular technology for aware-
ness causes, introducing research
being one of many.

Facial hair  health care

MCT Campus

Growing a beard could help Obama deliver on his campaign promises

 
  
 

Steve Kaszycki
Columnist

Barack Obama’s presidency hasn’t

been going too well lately. His poll .
numbers are deteriorating, his I

health care agenda has become
deeply unpopular with the Ameri-
can public and the people of Mas-.

sachusetts elected a Republican to ;

Teddy Kennedy’s seat — seriously,
all of Kennedy’s personal problems,
including prolonged alcohol abuse,
never fazed them, but Barack Obama
-and former U.S. Senate candidate
Martha Coakley, guilty of perhaps
the single most inept campaign in
modern political history, did.
Some would propose a change
of political focus, a shift to the
economy or a greater embrace of
‘a bipartisan spirit. All ﬁne ideas,
butI have abolder proposal. Barack
Obama should grow a beard.
Picture the president with a
beard. His hair is already losing its

color, so it would be one of those
mannerly, gray or white beards,
the kind that often adorns Morgan

Freeman’s face in various ﬁlm ap- S
‘ pearances. And everybody loves’

Morgan Freeman.
A beard would give Obama an air

of wisdom. He would resemble the .
_ kindly old gentleman that Freeman

often plays — always more intel-
ligent than he lets on and ready to
dispense wisdom (or in the case of
Freeman’s Oscar-winning role in
Million Dollar Baby, a good punch).
The image ofobama as the idealistic
young man who got inway over his
head would give way to an image of
the wise, genteel leader.

S Moreover, it would link him
to that "famed politician to whom
supporters frequently compared
Obama: Abe Lincoln. Lincoln was
the ﬁrst bearded president, and
from his time until the rise of Wood-

row Wilson, more presidents than '

not sported facial hair, many of
them the full beard. And who would

you rather more closely resemble,
Mr. President? Wilson — who* re-
segregated the civil service — or
Lincoln? .

Sadly, contemporary politicians
have ﬂed from facial hair as if it were
ﬁscal responsibility. Long gone are
the days of the bushy beards of Ru-
therford B. Hayes and Ulysses S.

’ Grant. Tom Coburn sported a goatee
for some time — daring, ‘controver-
sial —— andl determined that I would
surely vote for him for president,
based on this fact alone. ’

John McCain tried many things A

to compete with Obama, even pluck-
ing Sarah Palin from the governor’s
igloo up in Alaska. But he didn’t
grow facial hair. A beard would

- have headlined CNN and Fox News.
Keith Olbermann would have sum-
marily labeled McCain a right—wing

_ extremist. I . -
Moreover, it would have given
McCain some better material for
jokes about his age: “Grover Cleve-
land recommended it to me, back

Funnyman finds offense, ego collide

Surprisingly, stars are sometimes sensitive. ,

“'I‘osh.0”
Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m.
Comedy Central

Daniel Tosh has had a hard _

week.
“I got in a lot of trouble via an-

. nouncing on the show to encourage

people to go on my Wikipedia page

and change things,” Tosh, the star of
the Internet—themed comedy show

“Tosh.0,” said in a conference call

last Friday. “They said that I used to

go back to Germany to get these hor-

mone treatments because Iwastrying
to have a sex change to compete in

female athletics. So that whole Wiki—

pedia thing has kind of backﬁred.”

ForTosh onTV,this kind of online
mischief should be commonplace. But
the attitudes of the cardigan-decked
TV prankster differ in real life.

“Confrontationis somethingl cer-
tainly don’t do well wi ' ,” Tosh said.

Regardless, Tosh has made a ca-
reer out of humor with a bite. Tosh
started performing standup in the
mid-’9os while a sophomore at the
University of Central Florida.

“I wanted to give it a shot, see if I
enjoyed it, and didn’t take it very seri-
ously,” Tosh said. “For that matter, I
still don’ ”

Like most college students, Tosh
was looking to escape a potentially
numbing 9-to-5 job. Without money,

and consequently, obligations, Tosh
slowly advanced through the local
comedy clubs doing 5-minute sets.
When he gained a substantial follow-

ing, Tosh graduated to driving around -

in his Honda Civic, working “insane,
crappy Holiday Inn comedy clubs.”
Inevitably, he attracted the interest
of the college crowd. -

“The rest is not that interesting,”
Tosh said.

Tosh became a TV host after he
performed a live version of “Tosh.0”
infront of Comedy Central executives.
The showhas since ﬂourished. Featur-
ing humorous breakdowns of viral
videos, cheeky quips, and perhaps
most famously, “Web Redemptions”
— segments in which humiliated vi-
ral video stars are given a chance to
redeem themselves —- its 30-minute
lineup is to the Internet what “The
Daily Show” is to politics: a mirror to
expose the absurdity of the system.

That doesn’t mean, of course, that
everyone’s afan. Tosh’s acidic humor
is a magnet for criticism.

“[The response is] nothing but
hate in ' ,” Tosh said. “Sadly, it’s the
only stuff that I really respond to.”

Tosh recalled an incident in which
he parodied a rapper’s video on air.
The rapper immediately posted a re-
sponse threatening Tosh.

“I don’t travel with any type of se-
curity, but I deﬁnitely will look over
my shoulder when I’m in Atlan ' ”
Tosh said.

‘ But he believes he’s uncovered

a dirty little loophole about to what
people take offense.

“People only get offended by jokes E

that personally impact them,” Tosh
said. “They don’t care if you’re mak-
ingﬁm of some horrible tragedy that
_didn’t affect them.”

For its part, Comedy Central goes
out of its way to avoid offense — a
process Tosh often ﬁnds baffling.

“You never know what they’re go— '

ing to censor,” Tosh said. “IfI ever
hint that John Travolta may like the
company of men, holy cow does that
immediately get cut out of the show.
So it’s very ﬁmny the things that are

okayto do, andthetl1ingsthatthey’re .

like, ‘No, there’s no way.”’

With the inevitable storm caused
by Tosh’s political incorrectness, it’s a
wonder he remains lighthearted.

“I just want [audiences] to laugh,”
Tosh said. “My show is certainly not
serious in any way. I don’t want any-
body to ‘get too upset if one of their
videos appears; and I make fun of it.
It’s really just a group ofbuddies now,
every week, trying to come [up]witl1
new ways to say horrible things about
people. It’s’meant to be jokes.”

When asked where he’d like to
be in 30 years, Tosh’s response was
blunt: He’d like to be dead, but re-
membered.

“I would like people to be like, ‘Oh,
that guy was really ﬁinny,”’ Tosh said.
“The idea of being alive, though, and
still having to keep doing it — that
seems a bit overwhelming.”

a limit, however, and AMD sees an
opportunity to squeeze more perfor-
mance out of the system as a whole
by giving some of the responsibility
of a computer’s CPU to a series of
parallel GPU chips.

While other companies have had
this idea — most notably Nvidia,
which has produced multi-core
graphics processors —-— AMD appears
to have somewhat bigger plans.

AMD hopes to begin adding GPU
parallel cores to CPU-ceiitric systems
within the next two years. Eventually,
accordingto Agam Shah,’ the article’s
author, AMD will attempt to ‘5de—em-
phasize” the CPU core, removing it
from many responsibilities and al-
lowing the GPUs to take over the lion
share of the data processing.

AMD has further developed a
series of programming tools, called
OpenCL, to assist developers in tak-
ing advantage of the parallel nature
of having a system with multiple GPU

cores.
While general-purpose comput-
ers, like the one sitting on your desk,
may eventually beneﬁtfrom this, it is
important to note that AMD seems to
have its eye on the server market.
Servers do tend to have abit more
predictability in their program ex-
ecution, as they are commonly de-
signed and set up to serve a speciﬁc

purpose. They are not ﬁilly at the.

whim of a user with some icons on
the desktop.
Many servers, with the excep-

. tion of web and ﬁle servers, spend

a good amount of their time doing
mathematical calculations. They are
perfect candidates for GPU conver-
sion.

AMD will have to make a— con-
certed effort, however, to prevent
its efforts in GPU conversion from
being relegated to niche markets.

l GPUs are excellent solutions for
gaining efficiency from programs

that are designed to utilize them.
Programs that are written in an un-
forgiving linear manner —- without
many steps that could be success-
fully executed in parallel —— will not
gain efﬁciency from parallel GPUs.

simple CPU.

Many applications, including ﬁle
and web servers, do not lend them-
selves by nature to parallelism and
would be a poor test bench for GPU
performance.

 

Scientists will most likely be the ﬁrst to beneﬁt,
as scientiﬁc computing is more often than not
highly mathematical, and ifwritten correctly,

highly parallel.

Failure to use AMD’s OpenCL could
make AMD’s efforts superﬂuous,
as the programs written for AMD’s
systems would execute in much the
same way as if they were run on a

Scientists will most likely be the
ﬁrst to beneﬁt, as scientiﬁc comput-
ing is more often than not highly
mathematical, and if written cor-
rectly, highly parallel. If AMD’s ef-

forts do successﬁilly inﬂuence the a
development of “standard servers”

1 as opposed to supercomputers, sci-

entists will undoubtedly be able to
afford more computing power more
often.

Preventing AMD’s efforts from
being a scientiﬁc niche will need tire-
less promotion of good program-
ming practices for non-scientiﬁc
programmers. AMD will have to con-
tinually promote using its OpenCL
tools when developing non-scientiﬁc
servers and perhaps eventually desk— ‘ '
top applications.

Until the time when GPUS con-
quer the desktop world, take com-
fort that your computer has already
begun to do some of what AMD and
others have envisioned. When you
watch a movie, much of the render-
ing processing is being done on your
graphics card, leaving your general-
purpose CPU to wait for your next
icon double— click.

ALBUM REVIEW

Is this a monologue,

or poesy that can sing?

Slam poet of yore ﬂexes his pipes.

Larissa Gula
Staﬂ" Writer

Band: Gil Scott—Heron

Album: I’m New Here ‘

Grade: B-

Record Label: XL Recordings

Sounds Like: A blues singer at a poetry
reading

_ Poetry and music often go hand in hand.
I’m New Here takes a poetry reading one step
further and becomes a bold statement about
the opinions of artist Gil Scott—Heron.

Best known as a spoken-word soul per-
former during the 1960s and 1970s, Scott-
Heron had not released any albums in 13 years,
and this not disappointing. '

Scott—Heron’s deep and soulful voice con—‘

tributes to the power of the issues he addresses
in his songs. His style, instead of focusing on

 

rhyme, focuses on power and meaning. And
theirhyme he does make is a bonus to his pre-
sentation. The background music is simple
yet powerful, drawing on the strongest points
from h

ip—~hop, blues and gospel music to create
an eclectic combination that deﬁnes Scott-
Heron’s unicjue style. ‘ V T

Keyboard and string instruments contrib-
ute toward a' sense of impending drama. But
Scott—Heron’s true power and emotion comes
from the inﬂection and pace of the poetry,
with the lyrics easily separating themselves
from the music. . .

The album begins with “I Came From a
Broken Home (Part 1),” invivid nar-
rative forma history of giving and loss within
a family. He creates an identity and a persona
which he carries throughout the record.

Scott—Heron not only sings, but also inserts
interlude tracks where he just speaks. With
his deep voice and storytelling style, it’s hard

A not to feel like a child sitting and listening to

grandpa. ,

I’m New Here ends with “I Came From a
Broken Home (Part 2).” It sounds exactly the
same as the opening track, but the words have

, changed as Scott—Heron explains why he is a

man. The last 30 seconds of the album run
without words, leaving the listener to take in
what he has said.

MEN’§ BA§KETBALL

Panthers stave off Colonials’ revolution

Wanamaker, Dixon compliment Gibbs in 77-53 victory

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

After getting all it could handle from
Robert Morris (16-9, 11-1 NEC) in
the ﬁrst half, the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team used a 13-2 second half run
to pull away after the break, eventu-
ally defeating the Colonials 77-53.
The Panthers (18-6, 7-4 Big East)
started the second half on a 13-2,
6-minute run at the Petersen Event

Center last night. The run trans-.
formed their 6-point halftime lead

into a 52-35 advantage.

“They have those smaller guards .-

that you don’t really see in the Big
East, and you are sometimes sur-
prised by theirtquickness,” Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon said of Robert
Morris. “We stayed with the same
technique and roles in the second
half, but I think we just wore them
down.” V ‘

Gary McGhée scored four
straight points  the break as
Pitt pushed its lead-into double dig-
its in a little morethan a minute.

Nasir Robinson and Jermaine
Dixon followed with a layup and a
jumper, respectively, before Rob-
ert Morris’ Mezie Nwigwe broke
up Pitt’s eight straight points with
abasket. -

Robinson and McGhee answered
by combiningfor three points at the

- , line, and Gibbs knocked down two’

foul shots following a technical on

‘ Colonials’..head coach Mike Rice.

Robert Morris never pulled
within single digits from that point,
as Pitt held them to 20 points in the
second half.

Gibbs found his shooting stroke

in scoring a game-high 20 points’

while shooting 40 percent from
the three. -

“It felt good [to hit some threes] ,”
Gibbs said. “It’s something I’ve been

Jermaine Dixon, who shot 3-for-6 from beyond the arc, scored 18
points for the Panthers. He also came down with six boards.

 

working on consistently, and I knew

it would fall sooner or later. I was .

just taking advantage of what they
gave me, and my teammates did a
good job of ﬁnding me.”

Jermaine Dixon continued to
impress since returning from his
ankle injury, joining Gibbs in double
ﬁgures with 18 points while shoot-
ing 3-of-6 from 3-point range.

Brad Wanamaker added a dou-
ble-double with 12 points and a
game-high 10 rebounds.

As a team, the Panthers shot 10
for 22 from beyond the arc.

“Teams knocking down threes
makes the defense extend more,‘
and we get more driving lanes,”Jer-
maine Dixon said. “We can dump
inside. It keeps teams honest, and it
can be a big part of our success.”

Jamie Dixon saidJermaine’s re-
cent shooting success results from
him joining the team in practice.
Jermaine, who was plagued with
multiple ankle injuries and a ﬁnger
injury, was unable to practice with

v 5 the team for an extended period.

“There was a two—week stretch

H where he didn’t practice and didn’t

play,” Jamie Dixon said. “He prac-

ticed the last couple of days. He’s a ’

different player, and We’re a differ-
ent team. Him practicing makes us
abetter team.” ,‘

The Colonials’ head coach said
his team wanted to make the Pan-
thers take jump shots because be-
yond Gibbs, Pitt tends to struggle
from three. However, the Panthers
thrived from three against Robert
Morris, and Rice saidjermaine Dix-
on broke away from his difﬁculties
beyond the are against the Colonials
last year as well. A

He also praisedJermaine Dixon’s
defense. ,

“Dixon’s good defensively,” Rice
said. “He makes you catch the ball
4 or 5 feet from where you should
catch the ball.”

McGhee scored all eight of his
points in the second half to go along
with six rebounds.

KaronAbraham led Robert Mor-
ris with 16 points, while Brad Piehl
added 11. Nwigwe and Veltonjones
added 10 points each.

Despite the lopsided ﬁnal score,
the Panthers weren’t always in con-
trol. In the ﬁrst  the Colonials

led for the majority of the time‘ be-
fore Pitt took a 39-33 lead into the
break. .

“We were able to play with them,
attack and move the defense, but
they kept coming at us, and that’s
what good defensive teams do,” Rice
said. “They made adjustments.”

The game was tied with about
two-and-a—half minutes remaining
in the ﬁrst half, and that’s when Gil-
bert Brown andjermaine Dixon took
over. Brown made two layups, and
Dixon hit a three down the stretch
to help the Panthers build their
halftime lead. The halftime score
marked Pitt’s biggest advantage of
the ﬁrst half. , 1,

The Colonials, who led by as
many as six in the ﬁrst half, shot
48 percent from the ﬁeld and 50
percent from three in the ﬁrst half.
Karon Abraham scored a team-high

14 points on 5-of-9 shooting from
the ﬁeld, including 2—of-4 from
three.

Gibbs and Dixon led the Pan-

thers through the ﬁrst half, help— '

ing them overcome the persistent’
Robert Morris scorers. Gibbs scored
eight of Pitt’s ﬁrst 11 points, ﬁnish-
ing the half with a game—high 15.
Dixon added 13.

The Panthers’ next game is on

Saturday at 9 p.m., when they take.

on West Virginia at the Petersen
Event Center for thesecond install-
ment of the Backyard Brawl.
“What happened down there is
behind us,” Jermaine Dixon said
of West Virginia’s 70-51 victory on
Feb. 3. “We’re going to be anxious
just because that’s the next game
that we play, not because it’s West
Virginia. We’re a new team since

_ that game.”

To be honest, I have mixed feelings about
snow.

I like it because, more often than not, it
makes for some beautiﬁil scenery; Snow fall-

you know? Sometimes if there is enough snow,
your school will close (thanks, Pitt) and: you
won’t have to work.

Of course snow can suck, too. Pretty bad.
Like having to trek, a couple miles from your
apartment deep into Shadyside to Oakland.
Your shoes get wet and soggy, your feet smell
and you’re only halfway there.

But snow means onething for all of us in
whatever quadrant of the world we’re techni-

ranks among the world’s most impor-
tant sports events.

It also marks the last time the
Americans won the gold medal.
Since their 1980 showing, they placed
higherthan fourth only once inseven
appearances. In 2002, they managed
to win the silver medal.

Some argue that the United States
struggles duringthe Olympics partial-

lybecauseit’susingso-called“Dream .

Teams” — ironic, yes, considering
they have yet to see the’f‘dream” —

with professional players instead of
amateur athletes that made up the

1980 team. But even that might be
in doubt because of NHL commis-

sioner Gary Bettman has hinted to-

wards disallowing the league’s player
to perform at the Olympics. After all,

the NHL essentially shutsvdown for
two—and—a-halfweeks while the in-

ternational games take place.

Still otherswillsay it doesn’t mat-
ter who the United States puts on its
team, because the problem lies in

player development ratherthan team
composiﬁon. Basically, the Americans
just aren’t that good at hockey on an
international levelbecause the nation
doesn’t produce great players.

Butthis year’s different. (Note the
period and not the question mark).

The 2010 roster is captained by
Jamie Langenbrunner, the 35-year-
old New Jersey Devils winger, with
alternate captaincies going to Dustin
Brown (Los Angeles Kings), Ryan Sut-
er (Nashville Predators) and Brian
Rafalski (Detroit Red Wings).

That’s some solid leadership for
the Americans. Langebrunner is a
two—time Stanley Cup champion,
Brown was named an NHL All—Star

last season, Suter won a few World .

Junior Championships for the United
States inthe early2000s and Rafalski
also has a couple Stanley Cup rings.

And this year’s team boasts a
youthful group, as only three .mem-
bers of the 23-man roster are older
than 30. The teamincludes up—_and-
comers like Phil Kessel (Toronto
Maple Leafs), Patrick Kane (Chicago
Blackhawks_) and Paul Stastny (Col-
orado Avalanche). Not to mention

   

Pittsburgh native Ryan Malone, who
now plays for the Tampa Bay Light-
ning afterafewyears with hishome-
town Penguins. A‘

There isn’t a lot of hype for the
Americans this year, but maybe
that’s what they need. In the past,
the expectations as the best team of
professionals headlined stories and
amped up predictions as to how far
the United States could go — only for
the team to fall. I

But this year’s team has the vet-
eran leadership and the young ﬁre to
make a serious runfor the gold medal.
The Americans, who will play three
teams from Group A before reseed—
ingfor the medal round, should beat
Switzerland and Norway in their ﬁrst
two games.

But so should the fourth team in
the group, Canada, which is why the

‘ﬁnal preliminary round matchup

between the two teams (Feb. 21) will
be one of the many highlights of the
Winter Olympics. An upset for the
Americans could make a gold medal
that much easier to obtain.

And that, no doubt, is better than
snow. '
