IR C Delegates

Attend Conference

Representatives of the University’s International Rela-
tions Club, and the Collegiate Council for the United Na-
tions spent last weekend at the Collegiate Council for the
United Nations Conference in the United Nations Building

in New York.

Delegates from the University were Andy Dixon, Dan

Johnson, John Burkheiser, Annﬁ

Watford, Judy Fingeret, Pat Pic-
cola, and Louise Mendelson. Miss
Mendelson represented the other
delegates in the CCUN Planning
Committee for the conference.

Eighteen students from the
University, Duquesne, Carnegie
Institute of Technology, and
Chatham College, represented
the Pittsburgh area.

Several colleges throughout the
United States participated in a
program of ‘‘Role Playing” in
which student delegates represent-
-ed the countries of the United Na-
tions in a mock General,Assem—
bly meeting.

In this meeting, which was
held in the General Assemblies
Building, the ‘students consid-
ered and discussed world prob-
lems and proposed legislation to
remedy each.

Afghanistan and Jordan were
represented by the students from
the University. Following the
meeting, the students met with
the actual UN delegates from
those countries.

Participation in the trip was
voluntary. The University donated
$115 to the group, and the UN
contributed $100 towards expenses.
The remaining costs were paid
by the delegates.

EDUCATION
Registration for the School of
Education isnow in progress for
the Spring Trimester. Forms
may be obtained in 2717 C1.

Whittier Claims
Pitt Chest Now

Unnecessary
Eﬁorts to revive Pitt Chest

have failed for the second
"time in two years. The once-

active student charity or-
ganization has been dropped
because of competition and
intra-‘committee disagreement.

Fred Whittier, chairman of the
fund drive which netted as much
as $4500 in 1951, said that “There
is no need for an organization
such as Pitt Chest on a large
campus.

The functions which Pitt Chest
once performed have now been
taken over by Student Govern-
ment, the fraternities and the so-
rorities.”

He was referring to the fact

that IF and SG have already

contributed $200 to the Muscu-
lar Dystrophy Association and
that some fraternities are or-
ganizing a cancer fund drive.

Alwyn Louden, advisor to the
Pitt Chest committee, gave a dif-
ferentreason for its disintegration,
however. “Conflicts within the
committee as. to procedure are
primarily responsible.”

The committee had agreed to
.send letters to the different
campus organizations asking for
donations but the letters were

Contemporary Age.”

Topics under this theme will
range from “Humanism and
Despotism in China” through
“Taoism in Traditional China,”
“Continuity and Change in Chi-
nese Political Institutions,” “Zen
Buddhism and N_eo-Confucian-
ism,” to “The Stability of Tra-

The Chinese Language and Area
Center has been established with
ﬁnancial assistance provided
through the National Defense Ed-
ucation Act as a part of the al-
ready existing Far Eastern Stu-

News Magazine

The Senate is considering the
possibility of publishing a maga-
zine that will combine the present
Student Government sponsored
publications, the Polaris and the
Calendar. "

Irving Rothman, director of stu-
dent publications, spoke at the
Senate meeting Wednesday about
the practical and ﬁnancial aspects
of such a magazine.

The proposed publication
would include University rules
and regulations, songs and
cheers, 21 daily calendar of
events, and pictures of incoming
freshmen.

“This magazine," commented
Rothman, “would be a great aid
in freshmen orientation as well as
to the student body in general.

“Freshmen pictures will give
groups some way of recognizing
incoming freshmen, and the
freshmen, will be aided in get-
ting acquainted with each
other."

Because of the limited time re-
maining before the publication
must be organized, President Pat
Teeters appointed a committee to
meet this week and make a sur-
vey to be presented at the next

meeting.

   

°U.S. Justice

To Receive
Doctorate

Chief Justice Earl Warren
of the United States Supreme
Court and public ﬁgure for

Convocation April 5. There
he will be bestowed with the hon-
orary degree of Doctor of Civil
Law by Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeld.

All 10 and 11 o’clock classes
will be cancelled in order that all
students, faculty, and members of

_ the University staff may attend the

ceremony in Syria Mosque.‘ The
program will begin at 10:30 a.m.
Warren. who celebrated‘ his
70th birthday last Tuesday, has
served as Chief Justice since his
appointment by Eisenhower in
1953. And the hearty judge has
no plans to retire even though
he could do so in 1963 with a
salary of $35,500.

Regarded by many as a liberal
Republican, Warren handed down
the decision in May of 1954 that
Negroes could not be banned from
any schools. He was also the Re-
publican candidate for Vice Pres-
ident of the U.S. in 1948 and gov-
ernor of his home state California
for 11 years. Before his appoint-
ment to the high post, Warren
served as the United States am-
bassador to the coronation of
Queen Elizabeth II in 1933.

The topic of Mr. Warren’s
speech has not yet been decided.

“The purpose of the convoca-
tions centers around the main
purpose of the University,” said
Dr. John Geise, assistant chan-
cellor in charge of student at’-
fairs. “It is one of three major
University events which recog-
nizes scholarly achievement in
University students at both the
graduate and undergraduate“

, levels.

A formal academic procession
will begin at the University and
proceed-to Syria Mosque. The
robes worn by, the faculty are
symbols of the university world
and are used only on special oc-
casions.

Geise Announces
Full Day of Class

Before Vacation

Despite the tradition of cancel-
ling classes at 4:30 p.m. on the day
preceding a University recess dur-
ing a holiday, all classes will meet
on Wednesday this year.

Easter recess will not officially
begin until 10 p.m. Wednesday
night, according to Dr. John Geise,
assistant chancellor in charge of
student affairs.

The University faculty has re-
‘quested that all Wednesday eve-
ning classes meet as usual be-
cause of the shorter term.

Evening classes were officially
cancelled earlier in the trimester
because of the snow storm, there-
by reducing the number of ses-
sions in each course.

The Easter vacation will end

Mon., April 3. All classes will
begin at 8 a.m. as usual.

 

nearly half a century, will,
speak at the annual Honors.

By PAUL B. WILSON

“I was unable to locate any
other school in the United
States which I felt would
provide me with the broad
training in economics and so-
cial development which I de-
sire.”

These are the words of Eugene
Baird, a student describing the
University‘s Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs.

"The school was created in 1958,
and is rapidly becoming a world-
wide educational center, leading
the way in preparing students for
service, research and develop-
ment in public affairs.

The G.S.P.l.A. was the creation
of Donald C. Stone, dean of the
school, who is currently in Yugo-
slavia organizing an exchange
program between the University
and the Yugoslav Federal Insti-
tute of Public Administration.

Civic Leaders Lecture

According to Dr. ‘Nendell
Schaeffer, assistant dean, the
school is dedicated “to prepar-

ing the students for entrance into
the profession of public affairs
and to provide a center of inter-
national ‘character for preparing
people of other nations for public
service.

“Vt-’e also provide programs
for executives, -well established
in their careers, attempting to
broaden their understanding of
the roles of public leadership.”
From time to time, outstanding

community leaders lecture in the
school. Among the speakers have
been Harold Busche, Personnel
Director of the Veterans Admini-
stration and Earl Shoub, Director
of the Bureau of Mines. ,

“This program is part of our
effort to keep in close touch with
those men doing the work,” said
Thomas Francis, director of de-
velopment at the G.S.P.I.A.

The curricula consists of four
ma_jor- areas: general public ad-
‘ministration, the administration
of international affairs, economic
and social development, and
municipal - metropolitan affairs
including urban renewal and
redevelopment.

Courses are directly related to
these subjects or are “core” sub-
jects of general value to all stu-
dents.

Studcnts Participate

Classes are small, similar to a
seminar in which each student
participates fully. “V’Ve want each
student to do the work that the
professor has to do,” said Francis

“Our classes are presented as
a series of problems with each
student presenting and discus-
sing his own solution.”

Because of the int‘ormality of
the classes, there is a close com-
radeship among students despite
the varied background. Some are
recent alumni of undergraduate

schools while others are doctors,-
lawyers, and engineers.

Many students are experienced
government officials in high posts
taking short term courses in tech-
nical areas.

Recommendation Required

The school is open to students
with an undergraduate degree in a
field related to public administra-
tion, having an academic record
indicating the ability to success-
fully engage in graduate study.

Applicants must he recom-
mended by persons familiar
with their character and poten-
tial for development. Prefer-
ence is given to applicants hav-
ing some degree of experience
in public affairs.

Sixty students, approximately
half from abroad, are currently
enrolled in the school. “There are
several reasons why so many
foreign students choose our
school,” said Dr. Schaeffer.

A check can be worth any amount-millions of dollars to a few cents. Whatever
the amount, the check itself probably cost the writer a dime. Now a dime may
not seem like very much money (especially if you can sign a million—dollar check).
But ﬁgure how many checks you write every year and multiply that by ten cents.
Adds up, doesn't it? The answer: Stop in at The Union National Bank and open
a free personal checking account. There's no service charge. No mainte- V
nance charge. No charge for new checks. No charge for deposits. All you do is
keep a $200 balance and your account is free. Sound good? Stop in soon.

Schools to Get
New Facilities

The University has an-
nounced that Salk Hall will
be the new center of the
Schools of
Pharmacy. ,

Feasibility studies are al-

ready under way to determine the
best allocation of space to the two

Dentistry and

A schools.

“This program will enable us to
provide a ﬁne show clinic for pa-
tient care and allow us to place
a new emphasis on teaching and
research,” said Chancellor Litch—
ﬁeld.

“This advance is basic to the

_ University’s long-range goal of a

totally-related community Health
Center.”
Features Enlargement

Major features of the 5.5 million
dollar project include enlarged
and improved facilities for ex-
panded programs, and improved
quarters for the dental clinic,

/which served more than 37,000

patients last year.
Substantial increases
search facilities for both dental
and pharmacy schools, and in-
stallation of approximately one
million dollars in new equip-
ment in addition to the major
reconstruction of Salk Hall, are
also a part of the plan.

According to the plans, ﬁnanc-
ing of the multi-million dollar im-
provement would be shared by
state and federal funds and by
alumni of the two schools.

Facilities Remain in SH

Salk Hall, which formerly hous-
ed Pittsburgh’s Municipal Hos-
pital, currently houses student
dormitories, laboratories for Dr.
Jonas Salk and for the Allegheny
County Health Department, and
special research and educational
programs relating to the Schools
of Nursing, Dentistry, and Phar-
macy.

The library, cafeteria, seminar
rooms, anatomy laboratories,
and certain other facilities used
jointly by the two schools would
remain in Alan Magee Scaife
Hall.

Teaching, research and patient-
care activities of the two schools
will not be interrupted by the
project,

Plans Made For Electronic Library

Plans for the creation of an
“electronic library” for the storage
and rapid retrieval of all Pennsyl-

vania laws pertaining to education
were announced recently by Paul

Masoner, Dean of the School of
Education, and Dr. Charles
Boehm, superintendent of the

Pennsylvania Department of Pub-
lic Instruction.

The project, supported by an
$18,251 grant from the Office of
Education in the U.S. Department
of Health, Education and Welfare,
will make use of the computers
in the Computation and Data Pro-
cessing Center.

Magnetic tapes in the com-
puters will be used to store all
state laws relating to education.

The purpose of the project is to

ComputerRecordsLaw

determine the computer’s value
for research in school law, as an
aid to scholars in the ﬁeld of
school law, and in the day-to—day
operations of the Department of
Public Instruction in handling
such problems as appeals, decis-
ions, and interpretations.

The new procedure will allow
legal searches, which formerly
took days and were still not
thorough, to be ﬁnished, printed.
and completed in a matte; of a
few minutes.

Eventually, it is hoped, the
electronic library will be of value
to legislators in their study of
school legislation and to local
school systems in enabling them
to make decisions based on laws
concerning education.

A A Too Closed for   Comfort

s 

lair rm 1 ,'

To have anything but small literary gatherings in the
Fine Books Room of the University’s Book Center is ridicu-

‘flous. Any one of the 200 people listening to Sir Cedric

Hardwicke discuss “A Victorian in Orbit” last Thursday
in a room designed to seat 50 people, at the most, could
verify this statement. In addition, the students, faculty
members and visitors. who did not arrive 45 minutes early
and therefore did not get in, would give additional support
to this case. ’ ’

Although, no doubt, a scholarly atmosphere is generated
by the walnut—pane1ed room with brick ﬁreplaces, red

A leather easy chairs, and millions of books, this does not com-

pensate for the crowded conditions which accompany each
of these sessions.

Since the University brings learned critics and artists
to the campus for the beneﬁt of its own members, in addi-
tion to Pittsburgh inhabitants, it would be wise to accom-
modate these guest speakerswith the proper facilities. To
be squashed into a room with 200 other people could not
appeal to the visitor anymore than it does to us.

The Student Union ballroom, although lacking the too
cozy atmosphere of the Fine Books Room, if used for these
book reviews and discussions, would provide the required
space and, at the same time, eliminate the dissatisfaction
arising from the entrance restriction that this tiny Fine
Books room puts on one method of education.

Charity} Case

Competition and intra-committee disagreement de-
stroyed a Pitt Chest campaign for the second consecutive
year. . / I v

Lack of agreement, in relation to procedures which
would assure a successful campaign, indicates that the Pitt

I Chest committee lacked a- clear understanding of the pur-

pose of having a University charity drive. ’

If the committee had known why they should initiate
a Pitt Chest campaign, the how would have been a minor
difficulty to solve. Uniting all groups by a charity body
was passed over quickly because this-committee knew that
the contributions would be few, since ‘thefraternities, soror-
ities and student government had already made private

i donations.

This committee must think that generosity is a trait
possessed solely by the Greeks since the only other group
cited by their chairmen, Fred Whittier, as a barrier to ob-
taining money was student government. (Greeks consti-
tute more than 80 per cent of its’ membership.) 1

Somehow this group rationalized that Pitt Chest should
be abolished since the Greeks and SG had usurped the func-
tion‘ that Pitt Chest once served. The individual charity
drives conducted" by the Greeks ——. a group that constitutes
approximately 25 per cent of the student body — serve as a
representative of the entire student body. In addition, to
solicit‘ funds from the independentswould result in an un-
successful charity drive since the Universitywould not have
the support of the Greeks who had already .made their

V charity payment.

Undoubtedly, Fred Whittier, representing the opinions
of this committee, underestimated the independents in the
-same way he did the Greeks. Charity is a quality that no
group can claim_ nor should be accredited with even by a
Pitt Chest committee.

Robbed of Spring

By Chuck Dunbar
“Spring has sprung, the grass is rizz, we wonder
where the birdies is.” These words of Ezra Pound,
echoed‘ in The Pitt News (slightly- changed), de-

scribe the transition from winter to spring in the
city of Pittsburgh, as well as
countless cities across the nation
just awakening from a long “old
fashioned” winter. The poem
carries an almost ' universal
meaning for these cities; spring
has arrived in name,.but not in
reality. Such will be the case on
April 21, when at least one half
of the present student body
heads homeward after another
year of college.
Sympathy Extended

For these students, although they certainly feel
relieved, I am sorry, for in my opinion they have

been cheated. Winter is gruelling, especially on the 1

college student. Short, cold days paint a dismal
picture, and leave the student with no desire to do
his studies. Basketball players end the season tired
and underweight; wrestlers have denied themselves
food for almost one third of the year; etc. for the
rest of the winter athletes. Social groups, the frat-
ernity system have been limited to the indoors, like

Foundationior Fiasco? . .

The State

By Joel B. Filner
From the beginning of the school year in Sep-
tember until early August, the revolving doors in

the Student Union are constantly going around in
circles. All varieties of people, from psychiatrists
to members of the clergy pass
through the doors to go to their
destination in the ﬁrst four ﬂoors
of the old Hotel Schenley.

The Union is even more
unique in the fact that it does
not occupy the entire nine ﬂoors
of the building (which is amaz-
ing indeed, for the need for office
space in the bureaucracy of the
University is - pressing). These
four ﬂoors are, theoretically, the
activities center of students.
Main Concern

However, on the four floors, about which we are
concerned, there seems to be the answer to the ac-
tivities-ambitious student. Interspersed between
the ample bathing facilities are the school publica-
tions, the placement office, the admissions office, the
scholarship ofﬁce, etcetera -— ad inﬁnitum.

This is not all. The main ﬂoor and basement
facilities extend to a usually jammed ballroom,
the Hunt Room, a music room, a recreation room, a
dining area called the Venetian .Room, a cigar

Here Comes Hazing .' . .

 

 

everyone else, but it seems a little more punishing
to them. Barren trees and gray skies suggest the
absence of life and spirit. ,

After enduring winter’s depression on the Pitt
campus, those students electing to pass up thevthird
trimester never witness spring life, the feeling of
being unbound. Under the old semester system,
there was always that opportunity, and of course
spring carnival. But this is not a complaint against
the trimester, only a hope. that the “unfortunates”
can ﬁnd a substitute for the benefits of a springtime
on campus.

Scenes in the Sun

The campus of the picture-book always shows
undergraduates lounging under summer trees, en-
joying. life. This is true. Students relax in the

shade and do some casual studying. They have

friends around, who will on the spur of the moment

simply take off from school and its drudgery to go

swimming.

But the two-trimester-man has left all this be.
hind for a “vacation,” which usually means a steady
job and other responsibilities. There’s one answer:
attend the third trimester if possible.

As for myself, I would think it a crime if I were
robbed of college life in the spring, just as those
aforementioned birdies were arriving on the scene,

s after suffering through one of life’s demoralizers,

winter.

‘of the ‘Union’

counter, and two sumptuous lounges. This is our
student union. So what’s wrong with it? .Granted
all this space is ﬁne, but how is it designed? One
shudders to think of it.

The brightly lit halls mirror the entire student
body ‘— apathetic. These wide corridors are car-
peted in a plush mater that was left over from the
old Senate office building (?). In so many words,

I the building is deﬁnitely not the epitome of Student

Union design. The stately well lighted rooms were
made for kings and presidents to ramble around in,
not students to meet in or for that matter, admini-

strators to “union” in.

The Best Part -
Now one comes to the interesting part of th

problem: How to solve the impossible‘? Design and

build you say. To design a building. to suit all the

T sundry organizations on campus, to hear their ideas, I

would be to have a building so designed as to give
equal space (to "solve the discrimination problem at
another level) to each organization. (Or to design
a ﬁasco as our neighbors along the way did.)

Of course to think of any new design or pro-
posal or appropriation for such a facility to be in
the making verges on the brink of lunacy. But one
must continue to mimic the Ivy Leagues and think
of stately 100 year old buildings -(or buildings of
quite ridiculous design) as a heritage of tradition
(or signs of progress?).

Huh? . I

Ban the Beanies

By Jim Nelson .
I have always wondered if a campus is more
colorful with all the freshmen wearing pink
beanies. The only time I remember seeing beanie-

topped people was at a party celebrating my ﬁfth
birthday when mother implanted A
a striped little hat on each child
as he came in the door. I under-
stand that my wondering mind
may be put at ease. They want;
to revive the tradition of fresh
men wearing dinks. K

I can see ﬁfteen hundred
freshmen passing, through our
portals of knowledge. There is
no mistake that they are fresh-
men —- one is slapped in the face
with this fact. Tired, confused -
eyes peer from under little pink beanies on their
heads.
Degeneroted Generation

To quote the immortal Charlie Brown, “Good
Grief!” Has our generation come to the point where
we must be led by the hand into every new experi-
ence? The various organizations on campus seem
to have this point in mind when they ascertain that
all freshmen students should be forced to wear
beanies. Mark the freshmen they say! Let him
and everyone else know that he is a lowly, unde-
sired freshman. Why?

     

The main argument for beanies is that they
promote group cohesivness. The “Dinks” help them
to meet other people who are in the same boat as
they are. Friendships will grow and the University
will gain school spirit,ietc., etc., into unlimited
vagueness.

Perhaps it does accomplish some of these am-
biguous goals, but what else does the wearing of
beanies envolve? Henry Frosh is given two mal01'
items when he enters the University —— an inspiring
speech from the Chancellor and a beanie. Armed
with his beanie, he begins campus activities.

Then the Let-Down

He smiles to upperclassmen and runs around
meeting the rest of the beanie topped beings. Peo-
ple laugh at his eagerness and stupidity. He is
spotted immediately by upperclassmen as being 3
freshman and is usually taken advantage of. The
smile leaves and tears formulate. Henry Frosh de-

‘ cides that he really doesn’t need that hamburger

from the Hunt Room, because he might meet some-
one. He becomes familiar with all the untraveled
paths of the campus and wouldn’t think of l0i“ing
an organization.

He just wishes he could get rid of the plaguing
idiocracy that has set him against all that college
has to offer —— his cute little pink beanie. But he
does have one consolation. Next year someone else
will be wearing the “dinks,” and he will not forget
it. *

Portrayal of Characters

ProVes‘GloriouslyGood’

By MATTHEW NESVISKY
When every single character in a book sounds exactly

like the author, the result may

be either plainly poor or glor-

iously good. In recently-released THROUGH THE FIELDS
OF CLOVER (275 pp.; Little, Brown & Co.; $3.95), the fact

that all the players are faithful megaphones of the author,

Peter De Vries, is deﬁnitely to

Peter De Vries is a qui_et, mid-e
dle-aged, Yankee nut who has in-
creasingly pleased the public in
the past with his gentle onslaught
of timely, slim, comic novels,
among them THE TUNNEL OF
LOVE and NO, BUT I SAW THE
MOVIE.

In this latest effort, e Vries
runs the gamut of humorous
style, from semantically pulling
the chair out from under his read-
er to teasing him with the subtle
Bard—like puns. On paper, the
story unfolds so hysterically that
it is almost disturbing.

Scotch-taped Together
The novel is built, or rather
it is scotch-taped, around a fam-

anniversary of old New England-
ers Mr. and Mrs. Ben Marvel,
the heads of the clan. It is the
clan, however, and not the an-»
niversary celebration, that is the
real treat of the book.

And that treat, of course, is
De Vries. Each character in the '
family is De Vries, and the char-
acters only ditfer from each
other in their degree of lunacy.
They actually boil down to be-
ing, in the author’s term, a lov-
able “constellation of freaks.”

There are, for example, the

Marvels themselves, sort of
laugh-grab_bing straightmen. Then
there is their son Cotton, who
spends most of his time reading
in bed, eating coleslaw, because
god is dead.

Then there is a whirl—wind col-
lection of marrieds, re—marrieds,
had—to-be-marrieds and never-
should-have-been-marrieds. And,
of‘ course, the products of these
dubious unions, including Beau-
mont, a promising young arsonist,
and Chester, a teener who speaks
only Elizabethan English.

Gags Fly Fast

Add to this melee Harry Merc-
ury, another clanner and a nerv-
ous television comic, who arrives
on the scene with his writers:
Chaucer, Profrock, who is a sort
of an Indian, and other various
primates.

Alpha Phi Omega

Transportation service for stu-
dents leaving Pittsburgh for the
Easter Recess will be conducted
by the Pittsburgh chapter of

vice fraternity.

Automobiles will leave the Stu-
dent Union for the Greater Pitts-
burgh Airport at several different
times during the day on Wednes-
day and Thursday.

Cost for the trip will be one
dollar. Funds raised from this pro-
ject will be used for the beneﬁt
of the fraternity’s various pro-
jects.

WALLET STOLEN

On Tuesday, March 21, Ralph
Conrad, guard on the football
team, had his wallet stolen. It
was taken from the Field House
locker room. There was a total
of $10 in the wallet plus irre-
nlaceable cards.

Ralph has asked the Pitt News
to notify the remover of the
wallet if he would please return
the cards. If this anonymous
person happens to be a reader of
the Pitt News he can get Ralph’s
cards back to him by either
sending or leaving them at the
Pitt News oﬁice.

 

the reader’s beneﬁt.

The gags, therefore, ﬂy faster
in this self-satire than a lady-
bug who has been told that her
house is on ﬁre and her chil-
dren will burn.

But a great deal of the charm-

ing humor is not found in dia-
logue. De Vries describes with a
barbed typewriter on every page:
“His lips on hers were like the
touch of cool, spotless bologna

At times, the ’author’s writing,

is intellectually contrived. At
other times, it is downright
clumsy. But at all times, the writ-

makes his rambunctious romp
through his funny ﬁelds of clever
clover a refreshing journey in-
deed.

Hoop Scandals
Partially Blamed
On Rule Makers

.. By JACK SMITH.
Executive Sports Editor

 

(Editor’s Note—This is the second in a series of articles on
NCAA and ECAC rules.)

The recent New York “point shaving” basketball scandal
that has again discolored college sports, recalls to mind a
similar incident that happened to few years ago in the Cats-
kill Mountains of New York.

During the summer, many New York colleges sent their
entire teams to Catskill Mountain resorts where the students
worked on the staffs, and played basketball in the evening
under the resort’s name. This in itself wasn’t cause of excite-
ment, but New York gamblers were taking advantage of
the high-caliber basketball ‘played and“ betting was high on
games between resorts.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association quickly
stopped the gamblers’ proﬁtable summer sport when it es-
tablished a rule preventing more than two players from any
team playing together in organized competition during the
summer or “off season.”

But there are deﬁnite rule differences between the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference and the NCAA
which cause confusion. I feel that these confusions are a
contributing factor in both the Catskill and the recent
New York scandals.

Under NCAA rules an athlete may accept a scholarship
that includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and
up to $15 a month for incidental expenses. All this is given
to an athlete for participating in a sport.

Under ECAC rules, however, all these beneﬁts are not
given to an athlete accepting a scholarship. The ECAC says
an athlete must work for his room, board and $15 a month.
Although the work most colleges give their athletes is not
strenuous, an athlete in a college under ECAC rule must do
more for a scholarship than the NCAA requires.

The difference in rules often breeds confusion and
discontentment among our Eastern athletes. These ath-
letes are natural targets for gamblers who take millions
from “point shavings” in ﬁxed basketball games.

Seton. Hall, Connecticut and LaSalle, currently involved
in the New York basketball scandal, are members of the

A Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference.

If more conferences acrosslthe country would unify their
rules on subsidizing athletes, there might be less athletes
tempted to make that “easy buck.”

 

It’s a Tossup I

Three Hustle
For Top Spot
Behind Plate

Bob New Possesses
Inside Track, But
Hitter Will Get Job

By JIM O’BRIEN
Whoever roosts over home-

plate for the Panther nine
this season will be a top-ﬂight
backstop according to Coach
Bobby Lewis. Right now he
feels like a college adminis-

trator scanning the capabilities of
entrants to school. All three of the
boys scratching for the starting
position are top-notch.

Lewis’ problem: which one to
elevate to ﬁrst-string status? Bob-
by New, a soft-spoken reserve
from last year’s team, appears to
have the insidetrack, although he
doesn’t appear very hungry for
the starting assignment.

New backed up Freddie Lan-
ningham last season, but the latter
is now performing for Buffalo
after the Philadelphia Phillies
signed him. Lewis rates New as
“a pretty fair hitter with a lot of
power when he connects.”

Two Tough Applicants

‘If he ‘connects often enough he
could seal a ﬁrst—team berth.
Lewis says that the catcher who
hits the best will get the job. Two
tough applicants for the assign-
ment are a pair of receivers from
the ranks of the local Central
Catholic High School. Sophomore
Tim Grgurich and sophomore-to-
be Mike Supsura both caught for
the Vikings up Fifth Avenue.

Last season Supsura was the
leading hitter for the Chrisian
Brother’s school with a .419 per-
centage. He also wielded a bat
for Hazelwood in the Greater
Pittsburgh League, the city’s top
sandlot circuit.

Grgurich, a member of the var-
sity basketball ﬁve, also competed
in the GPL with the Lawrenceville
representative.“ His bat doesn’t
crack as loud as Supsura’s, but his
defensive ability is on par with
his two. adversaries.

No Fierce Competition

This situation, a three—deep
catching department, 01 e 1 i g h 1; s
Lewis, but it has failed to breed
any ﬁerce competition to date.
This may stem from the fact that
the boys are slightly bored at their
conﬁnement in the Field House..

Warm weather and less rain
could be just the cure-all that a
psychologist would prescribe.
The trio is anxious to get out
onto the ﬁeld and break the
stalemate, by silencing the crit-
ics with their bats.

“It’s a tossup,” Lewis confessed.
“They all have good arms, and
handle the ball well. I can’t draw
too much difference between any
one of them just yet.”

“Catching is a hazardous occu-
pation,” he concluded, “and split-
ﬁngers and such can sideline a
person easily, so I’m happy with
the depth situation.”

Any one of the three contenders
will be happy too, if he can
mount the summit of that mass.

Martin Finishes Third;
Panthers Tie For Fifth ~

By BOB SMIZIK
Larry Lauchle saved his best for last. The Panther ace
lived up to his number one seeding by winning the'NCAA
130-pound championship, with amazing ease. He humbled
Iowa State Teacher’s Dave Jensen, 7-0.
It was a sweet victory for Lauchle, who had been run-
nerup the two previous years. His success was the chief

reason the Cats were able to tieO

Lehigh for fifth place.

Oklahoma State easily outdis-
tanced the ﬁeld to capture ﬁrst
place. They had 82 points to run-
nerup Oklahoma University’s 63.
Next came Iowa State and'Oregon
State. Penn State ﬁnished seventh.

All Time Great '

Lauch1e’s victory further en-
trenched him as one of Pitt’s all
time greats. His 27-1 dual meet
record is second only to Ed
Peery’s unblemished mark. His

«two Eastern titles give him a sec-

ond to Dave Johnson, who had
three, in that category. Now he
joins a group of seven other Pan-
thers as a National Champion.

The four other grapplers that

made the trip were not as suc-

cessful as Lauchle.

Rich Martin made it to the
semi-ﬁnals before he was elimi-
nated. The culprit was Masaaki
Hatta of Oklahoma State. The
littlest of the “mighty mites”
then proceded to win all of his
consolation matches, to ﬁnish
third.

set and then was upset himself.

it Bowl Trip Almost Cancelled’

Governor Tries
To Stop Contest

By ED HO\VARD
It had been 20 years since

‘V

the Panthers had received a
.bowl invitation. In 1936 Jock
';Sutherland tok his charges
,to the Rose Bowl and had

come away the victor. Now it

was 1956, the coach was Johnny
It/lichelosen, and the destination
3,, was the Sugar Bowl.

The Jungle Catshad rolled up
an impressive 7-3 record in the
regular season, including key wins
over arch—rivals West Virginia
and Penn State. To top it off,
they had been selected as top team
in the East and were awarded the
Lambert Trophy.

Their opponent was to be

»-Georgia Tech. The team from At-
lanta had lost only once in ten
, games, ‘dropping a two—point de-
‘ cision to Auburn. Coach. Michelo-
sen said that they were deﬁnitely
the top team in the South. In ad-
dition, the Engineers had won six
consecutive decisions in major
bowl games, a record no other
school had ever approached.
Substitute Fullback

But the Panthers almost didn’t
get to play Georgia Tech. The
governor of Georgiadecided that

_- the southern boys shouldn’t take
the ﬁeld against a team that had

a negro in the roster. The Cats’

had one, substitute fullback: Bob-
by Grier.

It seemed that the governor
was the only one who held that
view. The Tech students pa-
raded through downtown At-
lanta cheering, “We want to
play Pitt!” Then they hanged
the governor in effigy. A bit,

Three Lettermen
Form Nucleus of

The Pitt tennis team will lack
experience with only three return-
ing lettermen. Coach Bill Sum-
mers is counting on them to form
the nucleus of this year’s squad.
, Racquetmen Paul Kochman, Ted
Martens and Matt Ziemanski have

all had two years of experience-

Last season they held the second,
third and fourth positions and
should hold approximately the
same spots this year.‘

Kochman was 2-10 last season
and 9-3 in 1959. Martens last
year’s mark was 5-10 and 7-5 in
the previous campaign. Zieman-
ski showed a 6-9 total in 1960
and 5-6 in his sophomore season.

Summers, in his fourth year as
tennis coach, has expressed opti-
mism over this year’s squad. “If
our three lettermen can show
their 1959 form, we should be in
pretty good shape.” T

to public opinion and issued
permission for the Engineers to
play.

In the meantime, substitute Bob
Grier was no longer a substitute.
Tom Jenkins, the regular full-
back, came up with a knee injury
and was shelved for the New
Year’s Day spectacle, thrusting
the young Grier into a starting
assignment.

Powerful Running

The day ofthe game arrived.

Georgia Tech, a seven-point fa-

vorite on the basis of their power-

.ful running game were forced to
punt soon after receiving the
opening kickoff. _

But a.. fumble by the Panthers

gave Bobby Dodd’s boys the ball
on the Pitt thirty.

The southerners called a pass
on the first play, and Grier was
covering the intended receiver,
Don Ellis, in the end zone. “Some-
body (it had to be Ellis) pushed
me in the back, and I pushed
back,” said Grier after the game.

Didn’t See

But the ofﬁcial didn’t see it that
way. He called interference, giv-
ing Tech the ball on the Panther
one. A play later, a quarterback
sneak counted six for the Georgia
team.

And that was it. The boys
from Pittsburgh spent the rest
of the afternoon trying to catch
up, but they couldn’t, and the
score read 7-0 at the ﬁnal gun.

Three times the Cats had ripe
scoring opportunities, each time
with a different quarterback di-
recting action, but they didn’t
have the luck that’s needed.

Not that it matters much, but
the Panthers dominated every as-
pect of the game except points
scored. They had more first downs,
more yardage gained, more penal-
ties against them, more passes
completed, more —— more every-
thing except the payoff depart-
ment.

What about Grier‘? Despite his
somewhat dubious mistake, he
still led both teams in yards gain-
ed and recorded the longest run
from scrimmage, 26 yards. And

Long and Mike Graft are no long-

With these talents missing, the
seasons outcome rests squarely on
the shoulders of Don Dermitt and
Stuart Sinodgr-ass.

Snodgrass hails from Beaver
Falls, Pa. His golﬁng accom-
plishments are many. Last year
he was champion of the West-
Juniors, 18
years or younger. He lettered
last year and was champion of
the Beaver Valley Country Club.
