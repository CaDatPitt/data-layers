mixed feelings about NAACP

Harry Mudd, vice president of Pitt’s
Black Action Society, said growing up in a
poor section of Washington, D.C., gave
him a negative attitude toward the
NAACP. .

Mudd said he never wanted to join the
organization because its members did not
seem to help the people who really needed
it.

“My neighborhood was originally
middle class, but people lost jobs, and it
became a poor area known for crime,
stolen cars and shootouts,” Mudd said
“The NAACP never came to my block.
They never came to my school. They never
talked to people like me.”

Mudd, a Pitt junior, ﬁnally joined the
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People last week at the start of
its annual convention.

He said he still is not happy with the
NAACP, but he now "hopes to change it
from the inside out and strengthen the ties
between the organization and the Black
Action Society while he is at Pitt.

Mudd joined the more than 12,000

NAACP members from across the cormtry
who ﬂooded into Pittsburgh this week for
workshops, discussions and marches in the
name of equal rights and opportunities for
all minorities. ,

During her speech Sunday night,
Mudd saw Myrlie Evers-Williams, the
widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar
Evers, claim that black people who believe
blacks should be separated ﬁom whites
were “rats.”

In another event, he saw Kwese
Mfume, national president of the NAACP,
speak, and he will attend President Bill
Clinton’s speech on Thursday.

Mudd said Mfume’s speech is one he
fotmd particularly invigorating.

“Kwese Mfume deﬁnitely came out
swinging,” Mudd said. “He was attacking
apathy in the organization and apathy in
general. There are a lot of people around
here who complain, but never do any-
thing.” ’

Apathy is something Mudd has seen
hold back many young minorities.

He credits a strong mother for his suc-
cess, but says the NAACP should step in
for young minorities who need the guid-

Oakland residents will have another chance to
argue their points of view about the closing of
Bigelow Boulevard in front of Pittsburgh’s City
Council.

Council was scheduled to approve funding that
would narrow the road from four lanes to twogat a
meeting yesterday morning.

Instead, they voted for another public hearing on
the issue after residents began a petition drive for the
chance to argue one more time against using tax dol-
lars for the project . ,

Council approved another meeting even though
the petition’s lateness made it technically invalid.

“It does not meet the letter of the law, but it is a

'petition nonetheless,” council President Jim Ferlo

said during the meeting. “We need to have a public
hearing.”

It’s oﬂicial.

E The hand of Marriott will no longer fwd the mouths of hun-
gry students on Pitt’s main campus. The company’s contract was
not renewed and expires on Aug. 1.

Instead, Sodexho Services Inc. made their way through the
contract negotiations and became Pitt’s next food service con-
tractor.

Pitt is hoping to negotiate the speciﬁcs of the contract with
the Trumbull, Conn.-based contractor by Aug. 1, according to the
head of the new food contractor search task-force Eli Shorak.

Shorak said he is optimistic about Sodexho’s assumption of

' the role and expects positive changes.

“We’re looking for improvement in the level of service,”
Shorak said “We feel there are some very exciting concepts that
Sodexho has put forth.  I truly think this is an excellent change
for the students.”

Both Shorak and Sodexho sales executive Keith Polizzano
hope to have a contract worked out by Aug. 1, when Sodexho will
begin its transition onto campus.

Whitewater prosecutor confirms
VinceFoster’s death was suicide

Miami Beach ——- Italian fashion
mogul Gianni Versace was shot twice
in the head outside his oceanfront
villa yesterday.

The FBI is looking into whether
suspected serial killer Andrew
Cunanan, of the bureau’s 10 most-
wanted fugitives list, has struck
again.

Police have said Cunanan stole a
red pickup truck belonging to his last
suspected slaying victim, a New
Jersey cemetery worker. Yesterday,
police in Florida hauled away a red
Chevrolet pickup ——- covered in fin-
gerprint dust —from a five-story
parking garage near the Versace
shooting scene.

A television station, WTVJ,
reported the truck’s vehicle identifi-
cation number ‘matches that of the
vehicle Cunanans was last reported
driving.

Washington, D.C. —‘ Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr has con-
firmed what three other investiga-
tions found — that White House
lawyer Vincent Foster committed sui-
cide. *

In a brief statement, Starr
announced he has filed a report with
the appeals court in Washington that
appointed him.

He says based on investigation,
analysis and review of evidence by
experts, he has concluded Foster
committed suicide by gunshot in

. 1993.

New York — If it was a missile that i

brought down TWA Flight 800 last
year, what kind of hot spot might

have become a target? j

A source close to the investiga-
tion says a test plane mimicking
some of the doomed plane’s last
moves will be checked for areas
where the temperature might be high
enoughto attract a heat-seeking mis-
sile. The source says the FBI request-
ed the test.

The plane’s engines, the most
likely draws for a .heat—seeking mis-
sile, were recovered intact after the
blast.

Scientists say an explosion in the
center fuel tank brought down the

plane, but what caused it remains a --

mystery. Investigators say it was like-
ly a mechanical failure, but they have
not ruled out a bomb or missile.

Capitol Hill — The Senate investiga-
tion of questionable campaign fund-
raising has produced its first direct
evidence of a foreign political contri-
bution.

The Democratic party is already
pledging to return the $50,000 in
question.

A memo released yesterday
shows that, in 1992, John Huang
asked the Indonesian conglomerate
that he worked for to “please kindly
wire” money to cover several expens-
es, including the donation.

Huang left the company in 1994 I

to become a Democratic fund-raiser
in 1995. One point six million dollars
that he brought in to the party had to
be returned because it came from sus-
pect sources.

Sfuden ts from Hong Kong
wary about Chinese rule

Jake Womer

Two weeks have passed peaceful-
1y since Britain handed Hong Kong
over to China, but people as close as
the Cathedral of Learning are still
wary of the new government in the
city and concerned for its future.

“I am afraid to lose some free-
dom, most importantly the freedom
of speech,” said Becky Mui, treasur-
er of the Hong Kong
Students Association and
one of 15 students from
Hong Kong currently
enrolled at Pitt.

Patty Poon, president
of the HKSA, also stayed
involved in the hand over - -z ------- - -
by constructing a web
page detailing and count-
ing down to Britain's
release of Hong Kong.

While some of these
students from Hong Kong
remained in Pittsburgh,
others returned to their
native land for the leader-
ship transfer ceremonies.

Pitt Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg was also in
Hong Kong, visiting the
University of Hong Kong,
at the time of the hand
over. He was not available
for comment.

On July 1, 1997, with
colorful celebrations and
few protests, the British
colony of Hong Kong
became the Hong Kong

Region of China.

In 1984, Britain and ' """ "
China negotiated a treaty for Hong
Kong’s return to China in order to
honor a promise made a century ago.

Britain ruled Hong Kong for 156 .

years, but, under pressure from
China, Great Britain signed a 99-year
lease in 1898. Though Britain guided
Hong Kong to economic prosperity
and capitalism, the British presence
in Asia is practically gone.

To retain economic growth, com-
munist China has promised to give
Hong Kong 50 years of relative
autonomy.

“I am sad and upset about the
hand over,” Mui said. “We cannot
really do anything about it, so we do

 

not complain.” ,

Other Hong Kong native Pitt stu-
dents echoed Mui’s sentiments.

“I am very disappointed,” said
Eric Loui, a Pitt junior and Hong
Kong descendent. “Personally, I feel
the culture will change because
China is so different. Basically, a lot
of people will lose freedom of
speech.” ‘

The loss of freedom of speech is f

a relevant concern for people ruled
 by a government known for
: 1989’s Tiananmen Square
5 massacre in Beijing —
 where over 1 million people
 joined a call for democracy.
 The government used mili-
 tary force to end the rally
 killing a number of protes-
 tors.
: With this in mind,
 Loui does not have much
 faith in China’s promise of
 autonomy.
, “China is not free
 enough to let Hong Kong
 do that,’.’ said Loui. “In
 China, you cannot even
 make a remark about your
 leader. The government
 treats the people like ani-
 mals in a barn, moving in
3 only one direction.”
. Monte Broaded, an
‘ associate professor of soci-
ology and coordinator of
Chinese studies at Pitt,
believes the autonomy will
last and, if successful, may
also lead to the reunifica-
tion of Taiwan. Taiwan was

Special Administrative  seized by Chinese national-

ists as they were ousted
 from power —— and the
mainland —— by‘ Chinese
Communists.

“The People’s Republic of China
regards Taiwan as a breakaway
province that must be brought back,"
said Broaded.

But — one way or the other —
Broaded said time will be the true
test of the reunification’s viability.

“Most of the rich people have
emigrated out of Hong Kong, and
most of the people who are scared
have emigrated to America after
Tiananmen Square. Regardless of the
fact of the takeover, it is my home. It
is going to be the same thing a year
from now,” he said.

The date of the meeting has not
been set, but Councilman Gene
Ricciardi said he thinks it should be
held in Oakland during the evening,
so residents can ‘attend without hav-
ing to travel out of their way or
interrupt work. A

Pitt would like to start narrow-
ing the road and landscaping the
acquired area on Aug. 1 and com-
plete the renovations by Sept. 1.

“We would certainly like the
project to be completed as soon as
possible,” said Pitt spokesman Ken
Service. “We had hoped it would be
done by the start of school, at the
end of August, and our preference
would still be for that timetable to
be maintained.”

But the new public hearing may
delay that schedule if council mem-
bers are persuaded not to approve
construction.

“If they are going to do some-
thing then do it quickly. The city
needs to quit dragging its feet,” said
Justin DalMolin, president of Pitt’s
Student Government Board.

The proposed reconstruction
will cost almost $850,000 — with
Pitt and the city each picking up
half the cost.

City council members must for-
mally approve the project before
funding it. That approval has been
held up until after the new public
hearing.

Pitt officials have been trying to
close the road between the
Cathedral of Learning and the
William Pitt Union for almost two
years, sayingthey need more space
for grass and trees on campus.

After numerous tests and public

hearings, Pitt and the city agreed to ..

a compromise last March: The road
would stay open, but two lanes
would be removed.

“The concept on narrowing

Plans to narrow Bigelow would wipe out this row of parking meters along the street.

"A6

G'Z‘3?Z'.'F' ‘g:-:v;;9-3?‘ _'



Bigelow Boulevard hasn't changed
since the compromise was proposed
in March,” said Service. “But if
members of city council are con-
vinced at this time that a public
hearing on the proposal is impor-
tant, the University will certainly
participate.”

Also participating at the meet-
ing will be Marshall Goodwin,
president of the Oakland Civic
Council — the organization that
started the petition.

Goodwin said he does not
oppose narrowing the street. He
said he only opposes the city fund-
ing what Pitt should pay for itself.

“We get pinned with this anti-
Pitt attitude, but it's not true,” said
Goodwin. “We just think they

shouldn’t be spending tax dollars‘

on Bigelow, when they should be
spending it on areas that really need
it like Center or Craig or Bates and
the Boulevard of the Allies.”

Goodwin said he thinks the city
should also have put the “hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on
consultants” into improving living
conditions throughout the area.

“The good aspect is that nar-
rowing the road will help pedestrian
traffic,” said Goodwin. “As an
Oakland resident, I’m in favor of
that. I just think the money could be
better spent. These changes will
benefit Pitt. I believe Pitt should
pay for them.”

DalMolin disagreed, saying that
Ferlo indicated the street “belonged
to the city” during a meeting with
him several months ago.

“He kept saying ‘What are you
trying to do with our street?’ If he
feels the street is the city’s, then
they should pay for the majority of
the renovations,” DalMolin said.

THE PITT NEWS

New freshman advising sessions focus on academics

sessions are still designed to “gel everyone
together”, Pencosky said they do not entire-
lyneglectthesocialaspectofcorningto
college.

“You come here to get the academics
done, but in a much more relaxed way,” she
said.

Pencosky said new strident programs
has tried to create an atmosphere conducive
to resolving academic problems during the
orientation itself. This way, the freshmen
fall arrival will be less stressful for every-
one involved — from students to
trative otﬁce statfs.

While incoming treshmen have the
option to commute or stay in Towers or
Holland Hall for the three days, all are invit-
ed to the nightly activities
such as movies presented by
the Pitt Program Council,
volleyball games and a dance
held dining each session.

Those who do decide to
stay on campus have a mid-
night ctnfew, but that doesn't
mean lights out either.

“The only problems that
really arise are keeping the
kids here,” said Pencosky.
"lhere’s always thelure of
going out [after curfew.]”

» ,- . So new student programs
_ _  a plan to combat that
problem.

In addition to stricter after-hours dorm
admission policies for the freshmen —
cornpletewithacalltoMornandDadfor
curfew crashers — new student programs

has trained its staﬂ' to better accommodate
the freshmen wanderlust.

Pencosky said freshmen peer coun-
cilors, who act as Resident Assistants and
advisors to the students, often design in-
dorm, after-curfew programs for the stu-
dents. The programs range 5%

’ ﬁorn informal ice-breakas to 
group games, allowing fresh-
men to blow off a little steam

Pencosky is one of nine
central staff members who
oversee the programs opera-
tion and direct the 32 paid
freshmen peer councilors.

In past years, over 120
volunteer mentors attended a
varying number of advising
sessions supervised students
during their stay.

But freshmen peer corm-
cilors have to be at all seven
sessions, bunk up i with stu-
dents during those sessions ”""
and stay in otf-campus housing when the
freshmen are gone.

If a contract isn't completed by the
August target date, both sides still said they
expecttobeginworkontheﬁrstandwork
to have the contract ﬁnalized sometime
later in the month.

Shorak indicated that the University is
hoping to negotiate a ﬁve-year contract.

Polizzano described the negotiations as
“g -natured on both si .”

“I really got the sense from talking to
the [searchlcommitteethatthereisasense
of partnership,” Polizzano said

Oﬂicials on both sides said they expect
a smooth transition because most of the
heavy appliances, ovens and refrigerators
currently used by Marriott belong to Pitt.

Shorak said the only major change will
be changing the logos on many ofthe ven-
dors’ spaces and making various adminis-
trative accommodations.

Polizzano added that, while Sodexho is
bringing in its own upper level manage-
ment staﬂ°, it is currently working with Pitt's
food workers union on a contract.

The contract will allow many of the
front-line workers to change uniforms, not
jobs.

Most of Sodexho’s operations will be

“One of the things that really came
through [inthenegotiations]wasaneedto
establish a healthy dialog on campus,” he
said. “We really want to have a lot of
avenues of communication with students.”

Sodexho has already responded to the
students complaining of a stagnant selec-
tion of food. Polizzano said the company
plans to implement ditferent options and
change them, if need be, based on student

nse.

“If you didn’t do that, it would seem as
if this was being shoved down someone’s
throat.”

Campus administrators see Sodexho’s
arrival as not just positive in a customer ser-
vice sense to the University, but in a ﬁscal
sense as well.

Shorak said one of the task force’s
goals was to ﬁnd a contractor who could
ﬁnancially contribute to the campus by ren-

’ ovating and building better facilities.

According to Shorak, the changing of
the food service guard has gone well so far.

ance many of them lack from home.

I Mudd, the only member of the Black
Action Society to take part in most of the
convention, said he thought Pitt did not do
enough to promote involvement in the con-
vention among minority students.

“I don’t know if Pitt did not take it into
‘accotmt or what, but there are a lot ofcol-
lege-aged and high school students there that

Pitt could have tried to get into the school,”

Mudd said
Pitt was represented at the convention’s

cultural program Sunday by the the

University ’s Kuntu Repertory Theatre,
which performed Our Spirits Soar. The pro-
duction was a mix of dance, theater and
music performed in conjunction with
Xpressions Contemporary Dance Company.
The Theatrehas been at Pitt since 1974
and is dedicated to promoting an under-
standing of African-American life and cul-
ture.
Even so, Mudd said attending the con-
vention has shown him that there should be
more interaction between universities and
the NAACP in general.

Gamrnage,” he said. He added that the
NAACP could assist minority scholarships
and encourage activism on campus.

Mudd said he thinks the NAACP con- -

cems itselftoo much right now with minori-
ties who have already become successful

Mudd said the clothing company
OFAAFO, a business which was founded
by minority st11dents, was not invited to the
NAACP business expo.

“They should be trying to promote
these types of businesses,” Mudd said He
said minorities who are already established
should be trying to invest in them to help
yoimg entrepreneurs succeed

Representatives ﬁom the NAACP con-
vention did not reply after being contacted
for comment on why OFAAFO was not
invited to the expo.

Mudd said more of the organizations
etforts should be spent in educating yotmg
people and helping out people living in poor
or dangerous areas. A

Mudd said he thought a good place for
the NAACP to_ start in Pittsburgh is with
Pitt’s Black Action Society, where minority
students may come from difﬁcult pasts or

 

are stmggling to succeed

This is where Mudd’s beliefs cross with
Aisha Anderson, president of the society.

Anderson, who is originally from
Baltimore, is an NAACP member in that
city’s chapter. She said she has taken part in
few convention activities because of com-
mitments to summer academic programs at
Pitt.

She said similar commitments have.

also kept other Black Action Society rnem—
bas from participating hi the convention.

“I’ve had long conversations with
Harryaboutthisissue, andlwouldhaveto
say that we’ve had a pretty decent working
relationship with the NAACP,” she said “In
fact, we’re trying to start a collegiate chapter
of the NAACP here at Pitt "next year.”

Anderson said she was not sure why a
previous chapter of the organization dis-
solved in the rnid-80’s, but said she was
going todo her best to start it up again.

While Mudd thinks the NAACP should
reach out to more yotmg people, he also said
more yotmg people should reach out to the
organization. A collegiate chapter of the
organization may help.

. “The NAACP is nm by people who
were very active in the civil rights move-
ments during the ‘50s and ‘60s, but we’re
not in that era anymore. We have different
problems,” Mudd said

Every movement starts with the young.
Older people have the experience and the
advice, but yotmg people have the strength.”

Anderson agreed, but said she thought
the NAACP is addressing those concerns.

“When you have an organization that is
national like this it can not be one of
extremes,” she said. “It can’t be for the rich-
est of the rich, and it can’t be for the poorest
of the poor. It must touch on the lives and
issues of all its members.”

Anderson said fmther involvement in
the NAACP will reveal that to Mudd.

Mudd said he has discussed these issues
with people inside the organization because
of his involvement and his negative feelings

' for the NAACP have been pushed aside by

the positive things he’s seen the convention
do for Pittsburgh.

"1hey’ve exposed a lot of the problems
here,” he said “It’s good that they came to
Pittsburgh.”

Dear Sodexho Management,

We are very excited that the
University food services will be orga-

hopethatyouareequallyeagertomake
sure that we like the job you’re doing.

enthusiasm for pleasing us, and they
took a lot of criticism ﬁom students for
that.VV1ththatinmind,herearesomeof

Most importantly, we want more

closed far too early at night and not open
until fartoo lateonweekends.Thereare,

they might like to car then. And closing
evaything by late evening is very incon-
venient for students; some things should
beopenintotheweehoursofthenight,
like mfeterias in the dorms. Students are
oﬁenuplateandsometimesgethungry
in the middle of the night; we shouldn’t
have to walk over to McDonalds or the
“O” at 2 am. to get something hot.

Though this may seem almost too
obvious to mention, we want good food

A good start would be cleanliness

Underpaid post-cloc teachers a mistake. I
é

Pitt is slowly phasing out the
tenure system, and, contrary to what
the admirristration is telling us, it is
going to weaken education at this
institution.

For some time now, there has been
a desire within some of the administra-
tion to start hiring underpaid post-docs
for teaching. We can all agree the the
$20,000 a year Pitt is proposing to pay
them isn’t enough. We are told that
these people will not have to do
research and so will be able to dedicate
themselves to the betterment of under-
graduate education.

But they’re wrong.

Underpaid post-docs are not going
to feel very dedicated to this school for
very long. Pitt won’t be attracting the
best candidates for the jobs,since they
will be going places that do offer
tenure track assistant professorships.
Pitt will receive only the second-rate
personnel, and they won’t stay here
very long. 'I'hey’ll leave, and we’ll
have to acquire new second-rate teach-
ers. By design, nobody will stay in
these teaching positions long enough
to learn how to teach and to refine their
course plans. Everybody will be start-
ing from scratch, and there will be no
such thing here as maturing in the abil-
ity to teach.

Apparently, the idea to do this has
come from a dissatisfaction with the
tenure system. The University doesn’t
want to pay teachers $60,000 a year
and to guarantee them a job for life
anymore. i

Tenure, in much of the country, is
already becoming strictly a reward for
research, not for teaching.iSome pro-
fessors will tell you that the general
review before awarding tenure seems
to be this:

Are they excellent researchers?

Yes.

THE Pl'I"I' NEWS

Are they not too-terrible at teach-
ing?

Well, sort of

Good enough: Here’s tenure!

Tenure is clearly not going to pro-
mote education if it is awarded this
way. But what is worse is denying
tenure altogether to those who are
doing the teaching. If tenure is an
award for good research, and the
underpaid post-docs are supposedjto
be doing the teaching, then the assis-
tant professors who do
get hired will not give a
darrm about teaching.

Here’s my recom-
mendation: First, scrap
the post-doc plan; it will
only lead to ruin. Next,

tenure review. If you
want to make education a
priority for the
University, as most
administrators will say
they do, then make it a
priority for achieving
tenure. But don’t remove
research from their duties

The problem with post-docs dedi-

cated to teaching only is that they will

not have a foot in current research,
which means they will not be able to
give their students the best education
they possibly can. .

It is wrong to believe that only
graduate students need professors who
are up on current topics. Undergrads
need them too — especially in techni-
cal areas where one may be trying to
get a job on the leading edge of new

‘frontiers with just a bachelor’s degree

(say, for example, computer science);
There is a certain quality of the
knowledge that comes from a profes-
sor who is both a good teacher and a
competent researcher. They know
what they are talking about. And they
don’t just know the course material —

they know where it leads to, and hence
they know what is important and what
should be emphasized. This is espe-
cially important for students who plan
to go on to graduate study and need a
solid undergraduate education.
Professors who teach and research
can also stir great admiration from
aspiring students. I was once speaking
to a professor after class about what it
is like to be a researcher. He told me
that it’s an amazing journey, because
eventually, if you’ keep
at it, you find that all of
your teachers and the
leaders in your field
have retired or passed
away, and suddenly, you

It was an incredible
moment in my world
view to think that one
day, I, too, might
become a leader in my
chosen field.

You see, I have a par-
ticular self-interest in
writing this column: I
am seriously contem-
plating getting a Ph.D.
and trying to become a professor. I
think that would be one of the most
fascinating and intellectually inspiring
careers I could choose. But I’m not
going to do it if I know that I won’t be
able to find a job when I come out. I’m
not going to do it if I’ll only get short-
term underpaid positions that will
never last or lead anywhere and won’t
be enough to pay off my student loans.
And that might be a shame because
I’m told by many people that I’d make
a great teacher.

I guess that would be everybody’s
loss.

Joe Camel died from the law that

Joe Camel, the lovable camel with
big city charm, who was known for his
trademark cigarette and participation in
every aspect of the American adventure
lifestyle, is dead.

Mr. Camel was renowned for his

appearance in magazines and on bill- ‘

boards around the nation as a spokes-
camel for R. J. Reynolds tobacco com-
Pauli

His life was cut short on July 11, in
the cloud of controversy surrounding
his appearance in such tobacco adver-
tisements.

Though he was expected to live
well past the 25-year life expectancy of
most camels, Mr. Camel died just after
his ninth birthday.

He died in the R. J. Reynolds com-
pany headquarters moments after exec-
utives announced the end of their Joe
Camel campaign of causes. His death
was directly related to his smoking
habit. '

“I think, while we hated to lose
Joe, it was time for Camel advertising
to move on,” said Richard Williams, a
spokesman for R. J. Reynolds’, from
his Winston-Salem, N.C., ofﬁce.

An ardent defender of smokers’
rights, Mr. Camel chose to speak softly,
but carry a big cigarette.

Though there is no record of Mr.
Camel’s youth, he quickly made a
name for himself after appearing in the
fall of 1988 as the poster-camel for his
namesake brand of cigarettes.

Williams described Mr. ‘Camel as
“fun, engaging and somewhat irrever-
ent.”

R In the early 1990s, Mr. Camel
began expanding his horizons from
magazines to billboards and eventually
to the race track.

Mr. Camel, or “Smokin’ Joe” as he
was affectionately referred to by col-
leagues, broke into the sports of

Nascar, Indy Car and motorcycle rac-
mg.

But he tired quickly — so quickly,
in fact, he never appeared in public on
a race track ——- but remained active at
his first love of motorsports, well
attested to by mountains of Camel
advertising material and several cham-
pionship teams.

But the blacktop wasn't the only
place Mr. Camel was caught taking a
drag.

“Joe has been in different scenar-
ios. Every time you see Joe, he is doing
something adult-oriented,” Williams
said. “He’s lounging by his hot tub,
he’s riding his Harley, he’s playing
pool  all adult activities.”

But with his success came tragedy.

Not long after his jump into the
high-proﬁle worlds of cigarette model-
ing, Mr. Camel was jolted by accusa-
tions that his nose bore a striking
resemblance to male genitalia.

Despite being the brunt of jokes on
programs like Saturday Night Live and
being unable to recoup his self-respect,
Mr. Camel persevered and continued

 

with his advertising contract.

Although he was very active, Mr.
Camel socialized. almost exclusively
with his four friends: Ray, Max, Floyd
and Busta. Mr. Camel even appeared
with “The Pack” in a series of adver-
tisements and camel merchandise cata-
logs.

Mr. Camel’s four friends, as well as
a mysterious blond-haired female
camel, who was seen in several ads
with him, have also disappeared into
the wake of their friend and fellow
species member.

Recalling the better days, Williams
said Mr. Camel and his friends knew
how to play hard and, well, play hard

Williams said they were always
“just fun-loving, hard-charging guys.
That’s what the brand stands for.”

According to Williams, a Mr.
Camel’s work for R. J. Reynolds boost-
ed their market share in the U. S. from
4.2 to 5.1 percent during his nearly
decade-long tenure at the company.
Camel is currently among the only
three full-priced brands still growing in

 
  
 

broke the camel's back

sales across the nation.

Despite his hard work,‘his depar-

ture is approached with some bitter-
sweet indifference.
“Joe Camel did exactly what he

was supposed to do,” Williams said. 4

“He repositioned a then-75-year-old
brand and made it a viable alternative
for adult smokers of competitive prod-
ucts.”

It was clear in the past several
months that trouble was in the air. Mr.
Camel was seen appearing less in new

ads, replaced by the more traditional, ‘
p humped camel displayed on the front of

Camel cigarette packs.

_ This fact simply made the thicken-
ing haze of scandal that started to sur-
round Mr. Camel only months after he
first appeared. 1

After breaking into the cigare
scene, Mr. Camel was accused by the
federal government of attracting

youngsters to smoking. Press agents ,

and public relations personnel from R.
J. Reynolds immediately denounced
the accusations as absurd. ‘

Many observed Mr. Camel’s only
public reply to be his silence and a
characteristically coy smirk.

The debate raged on throughout his
career.

Finally, in the midst of the Ligget
company’s damning evidence that cig-
arettes are ha_rmful and last month’s

negotiations between tobacco manu-.

facturers and the government, it hap-
pened.

The law broke the camel’s back.

Mr. Camel is survived by the R. J.
Reynolds company from Winston-
Salem, N.C. ‘

Burial will be private and dona- '

tions may be made out to the American
Lung Association.

Usually, when you’ve got an itch to see a classic
ﬁlm, you have to go to the video store. Some nights,
the ﬁlm you want to see isn’t there. Some nights, it’s
there, but your ﬁiend with the VCR doesn’t want to
watch it Some nights, you actually rent the tape, but
it’s in terrible condition, with video squiggles and
screeching white misc.

Inanycaseyoucmseandscreamandwishyou
could travel back in tine to see the movie when it
was released on the big screen.

For 35 nights in July andAugust, the Pittsburgh
Cultmal Trust will become that cinematic time
machine. The Trust’s Summer Film Series, assem-
bled by former Point Park Playhouse Film Director
Richard Rauh, comprises ﬁve weeks’ worth of the
greatest movies in ﬁlm history, beginning with
Kenneth Branagh’s. recent production of Hamlet and
ending with Pitt alurmus Gene Kelly’s masterpiece,
Singin ’ in the Rain. .

Anewﬁlmserieshadbeen“inthebackofmy

beenintheforeﬁontofpeople’sminds.Icanjust

The Playhouse ﬁlm series, which was shut
down by Point Prnk College in 1994, provided
Oakland residents with a venue for ﬁrst—rrm indepen-
dent ﬁlms as well as occasional classics and cult pic-
tnres. Thistimearound,onlyafewofRauh’s selec-
tions are recent, but they’re wildly eclectic, spanning

 
 

seven decades and every conceivable geme.

“I rarely have a pattern when I [pick ﬁlms],” said
Rauh“IguesswhatIwasdoingwastryingtopro—
gram it for all sorts of tastes. I can’t expect the
Philadelphia Story audience to want to go see A
Clockwork Orange, but who knows? I found at the
Playhouse that there are separate audiences for dif-
ferent movies.” A

If one of those audiences is the “college audi-
ence,” it may have some generational preferences —
say, Harrison Ford’s gritty detective in Blade Runner
rather than Bette Davis’ sadist in Whatever
Happenedto BabyJane?———butallthe ﬁlmswill be
equally accessible, with the downtown Byham
Theater a quick bus ride away and student tickets
only $3. i

The series provides more ﬁlm for the dollar too:
17 of the 27 movies scheduled run longer than two
hours, with Hamlet topping the list at four full hours
and Lawrence afAmbia close behind at three hours
and36minutes.AccordingtoRauh,this wasanacci-
dental side etfect of selecting many movies, ﬁlmed in
Cinernascope, which bend toward the extravagant.

BOOKNOTE

 

THE P|'l"I' NEWS

_  ., -  .. Many artists lose their
C SOUNDBITE; way trying tobring sanity
‘ and organization into their
work. The new local group
On knows better than to
even make the effort.
Instead, they put their
» V hearts and souls into mak-
ing music that rips the sweat from their pores and
the tears from their eyes.

John Bechtol, Eric Fox and Kevin Charney,
formerly known as the Kelly Affair, have turned
their mics back “on” to introduce a revamped,
sophisticated rock sound with an emphasis on
strong melodies. The new group incorporates the
emotional, balls-out rock sound, which Bechtol
and Fox are notorious for, with a lustrous arrange-
ment of songs.

On’s first CD, Contact, finally articulates what
the band has been striving for through years of
playing Pittsburgh's music holes and competing in
the Graffiti Rock Challenge. Bechtol paints a
mood of scorn and heartache through painful har-

‘ monizing chords and powerful lyrics that seep

with artistic passion and frustration.

The first track, “You Want It?” is a surge of
vocals and faster-than-pop rhythm. It has a terriﬁc
chorus line that cries out at you with edgy guitar
licks; bold bass and drum accompaniment as
Bechto1’s vocals ride atop the mix : “You want it?! !
Don’t you see it’s in your hands.”

“Crossover” is about a relationship that threat-
ens to drive a person out of his mind. The song
evokes the tormented soul’s confused dreams of
trying to work things out with his lover and with
himself. The dark cry that resounds through the
track asks when “will it all be over?” Though the
lyrics conclude that there mightbe a resolution, the
music in the background echoes past the life of the
song.

Living on the edge of insanity and trying to
see past earthly frustration is central to Bechto1’s
work. The music carries a mind-boggling emo-
tional charge. For example, Fox and Bechtol have
worked together to fuse powerful questions such
as “Would you believe me if I laid before you call-
in’ your name as I began to die?” onto ferocious

harmonies. They are driven by an inner force,

unaware how to channel it — and that’s the way it
should be. On’s musical vision, born out of

’Bechtol’s inspiration, works best when left raw

and untamed.

Onis CD release party will be at Nick’s Fat
City (South Side, 1601 E. Carson St.) on July 18

The “universal cosmic
5 O U N D B ' T E groove” of Blindsight is
about to take the next step
in its evolution.

South Oakland musi-
cian Lenny Williams has
melded his own name
with that of his band; “Cosmic Funk,” the new
single from the upcoming album The Energy
Connection, appears under the name LW

 

Blindsight. Williams has been working on The

Wednesday, July

Energy Connection, Blindsight’s debut effort, for
almost a year. Now “Cosmic Funk” is getting
radio play on WYEP, WAMO and the X, and the
full album is set to hit stores in the fall.

The original Blindsight band, comprising
Williams and several musicians from Pitt’s radio
station WPTS, energized Pittsburgh audiences for
three years. But when Williams took Blindsight’s
psychedelic funk rhythms to album producer
Chyp Davis, known for his work with Earth,
Wind and Fire; Toni Braxton; and George
Harrison, disagreements over recording led to the
departure of the rest of the band.

Davis polished the hybrid form’ of experi-
mental funk percussion that Williams had been
developing, dropping the once-hypnotic percus-
sion for a jazzy, easy listening sound. The music’s
message remain the same, however: a vision of
universal love that Williams hopes will inspire a
spiritual rennaisance in the coming millennium.

The vision of the “universal cosmic groove”
coalesced during Williams’ time at Pitt, where he
studied jazz guitar, music theory
and electronic music, as well as
coordinating the short-lived
Students for Media and Arts
Council. Williams also names his
stint in Pitt’s African Drum
Ensemble as a major inﬂuence on
his work.

Expect to hear a lot of psyche-
delic funk in the tracks on The
Energy Connection. “Ballad of a
Go-go Queen” is one example of
how vivacious and energetic LW
Blindsight’s music can be: ‘ ,
Worldbeat inﬂuences are fused with - ’ ’
jazz in the spirit of rock’n’roll.

Williams reworks a previous

Blindsight song, “1,000 Guys,” to ‘
refocus his original concepts. “Energy
Connection” itself is a reach-out-and-touch-
someone-with-your-soul idea that encompasses
Williams’ cornucopia of musical inﬂuences. The
chilled-out vibe of “Cosmic Funk” mixes twang
beats and ripping guitar solos.

The music crosses over various radio formats
fitting into dance, pop, R&B, funk and adult con-
temporary. Williams believes that his true mes-
sage probably won’t be understood till after he is
gone, but regardless of his underlying message
his music is still a good time. His seductive voice
is positive and void of pretentious stage confi-
dence, and Williams’ chants of positive energy
and universal love are reminders that music
should invite everyone to partake of it.

If the radio play of “Cosmic Funk” isn’t
enough for you during the wait for The Energy
Collection, a sampling of Blindsight’s music can
be heard on the web at
www.citysound.com/blindsight.

y, July ‘I6, ‘I997

 

Tight, intense and lone-
ly, Hurl’s second album
combines hard-core,
indie-rock aesthetic with
rebellious punk-rock spir-
it to create a sound that’s
not quite either, but
iling to fans of both.
inchanting harmonies accompanied by the
1 edge of gritty reality give not a memory an
st, determined style. The tracks ﬂow togeth-
if thrl band never stops to breathe, and the
-.aren-’t ﬂashy or over-written. Music, rather
imaggt, is the band’s focus. Hurl isn’t afraid
perinlent, pushing their songs further than
131' band might be able to: Chords and beats
ake i’ expected trips without degenerating
lWil( frenzy of instruments.
he first track, “Bred in Kentucky,” is a
bang; introduction to the album’s strong
line and drum beats. The lyrics speak of the
:s of whiskey, a favorite drink of the band:

. “Kentucky, USA bred a loser /
Apologies to you and your farm-
ly.” If they were drinking while
recording this song, though, I’d be
amazed to hear what they might
sound like sober. Each instrument
 contributes its own intricate voice
5 to the song, giving rise to an
inspired creation of natural musi-
cal innocence.

“Everything is Electric” deepens
the mood with frustrated lyrics and
fierce moments of never ending
 chords: “’Ihere’s nothing left that’s

 important to me / that’s why none
5" of my plans will work out my
way.” The vocals are played down,
~ putting emphasis on what’s going

the background harmony.
he thematic continuity of the album begins
birth and doggedly continues on to develop
in entity independent of any preconceived
the musicians might initially have had. This
magic of not a memory: Each member of
and brings his own talents to the studio
id offollowing a single leader. Mat Daly
11'), Matt Jencik (bass), Noah Leger (drums)

Shakespeare before making any more references.

Although they don’t
know their Shakespeare
from a hole in the
ground, the Ike McCoy
Band’s ...Made
Glorious Summer is a
_ highly listenable album.
" J  This local band
sounds like the Dave Matthews Band and Blues
Traveler got together and produced an offspring.
Lead singer Jamie Bernarding doesn’t have the
vocal ﬂuidity of Blues Travelers’ John Popper, but
his voice sounds extremely similar on songs such as
the opening track “Slur”. The Dave Matthews vibe
is evident in the album’s off-the-cuﬁ, just-jammin’
mood.

If the alburn’s title tempts you to use the liner,
notes as clitf notes for your Intro to Shakespeare
class, don’t. Although the band admits that the
inspiration for the title ...Made Glorious Summer
came from John Steinbeck and not the great Bard,
the “Richard III” quote “Now is the winter of our
discontent made glorious summer by this son of
Yor ” is completely misinterpreted.

The liner notes state, “.’..that even in our dark-
est hour, there is always something — a friend, a
pet, a memory, a child, a place to transform our
metaphorical winter into a glorious summer.” They
also hope that this album will be its listener’s “son
of York” First of all, the speaker of the quote,
Richard, hated the son of York. Second, the “glori-
ous summer”, as far as Richard is concerned, is war.
Death and destruction, folks, not cute little furry
animals. Happiness and laughing children add up to
“the winter of discontent” for Richard.

This album is no son of York. Fused with ener-
getic guitar riffs, tight drumming and melodic
vocals, it is not a treatise on the depths of ruin and
despair, but rather a toe-tapping attempt to brighten
the listener’s day. “Richard III” is the wrong
Shakespearean play for the Ike McCoy Band;
they’d be better off placing themselves in “Much
Ado about Nothing," where they could sing “hey
nonny nonny!” with a carefree spirit rather than try-
ing to twist “now is the winter of our discontent”
into a happy line.

...Made Glorious Summeris a highly enjoyable
album that comes right out of our backyard, and the
Ike McCoy Band and anyone who picks up the
album need not feel discontent about that.

both length and difficulty. _

“When working out at high intensity with quick explo-
sive movements, the first thing your body loses is adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), which is the muscle’s energy supply,”
said Jamie Dorley, a user and salesman of creatine. ‘That's
why you fatigue.”

Once in the muscle, creatine is stored as creatine phos-

- phate, a substance that helps power the muscle-contraction

process during exercise. During exercise, ATP is the main
energy source — allowing someone to exert high amounts of
energy quickly. -

However, the amount of ATP in the muscle will fuel a
maximum effort such as lifting weights for only 10 to 15
minutes. After the ATP is used up, the body relies on creatine
phosphate to restock its supply of ATP.

So, with the added creatine level, an athlete’s ATP level
will be replenished for longer periods of time, allowing more

‘ work to be done for longer at the same intensity.

Athletes in training have always. supplemented their

body’s creatine with outside sources, but not in the form of a
powdered drink. Creatine is found naturally in beef and fish,
high—protein staples for many workout buffs.
I But, in order to get as much creatine as in the newer
commercial products, a person would have to eat nine
pounds of meat. Five grams of a creatine supplement has the
same amount of creatine as in 2.2 pounds of meat.

“Having more ATP helps speed up the muscles recovery

from exercise, which may delay fatigue,” said Wayne ‘

Campbell, a researcher from the Noll Physiological Research
Center at Penn State University.

OlympicCommittee.

“I’m here to encourage the University of Pittsburgh to at
least take a look at the possibility of reinstating the men’s gym-
nastics program,” said Richard Aronson, liaison from the USA
Gymnastics program to the NCAA.

Aronson’s encouragement comes from a grant by the
Olympic committee to the East Coast Athletic Conference, the
league that included Pitt’s gyrrmastics team until 1995. Out of a
total $8 million designated by the committee for “endangered
and emerging  $15 million will go to the ECAC.

If Pitt gymnastics were to rejoin the ECAC in the near
future, Aronson estimates that over half the conference’s grant
could go to the University. Were Pitt to start a men’s club team
that would eventaully join the conference, rather than a com-
petitive one joining immediately, it could receive a smaller

It’s natural, but so is Insulin Growth

drug recently banned by the International
Olympic Committee and the NCAA that

Creatine supplements are still in
their early stages of use. The first known
users were European Olympians in the
1970s.

The first creatine supplement
reached the market in 1992. Still, no
studies have been done on the effects of
long-term creatine use.

The debate on the potential side-
effects of creatine supplements may go
on for a number of years. The one thing
proven is that it does enhance perfor-
mance, whether natural or not. 0

Does this breed unfair competition?

Until now, the NCAA has regarded
creatine as similar to any other natural,
nutritional substance. But, never before
has a natural substance been able to cre-

mance. .

So, where to draw the line?

“Not until more research is done on
the exact results of creatine use can we
make a decision,” said Thomas; “Only
preliminary studies have been done.”

For now, athletes will be able to use
creatine as much as they want, and this

Aronson, USOC and ECAC oﬂicials will

the grant could go to what schools.

It’s all the  s” that have kept the Pitt
athletic department from jumping at the
grant money. Assistant Athletic Director
Ron Wahl said the school has yet to receive
any oﬂicial notiﬁcation of the grant. And
without such notiﬁcation, no change in the
current school policy — zero expansion in
men’s sports programs —— is expected.

“Any comment at this point would be
premature and speculative,” said Wahl of the
USOC grant.

Pitt Athletic Director Steve Pederson
was unavailable for comment, but has said
in previous interviews — most recently after
the start of the women’s softball program —

6 that no men’s programs are scheduled for

reopening.

T‘hat’s where the alumni come in.

“We’re trying to save the program,”
said Mark Saleem, former Pitt gymnast and
reunion organizer.

He was quick to point out that restarting
the program is “not going to cost the
University anything, or at least not very
muc  I

Naturally, this could be viewed as a
positive for an athletic department currently
spending$9n1illionayearandtal<ing injust
over $1 million in revenue.

“I realize the Univasity has a money
problem,” said Aronson, who has has met
withPedersonandsaidtheathleticdirector
“seemed receptive [to restarting the pro-
gram], but nothing deﬁnite.”

Again, the “nothing deﬁnite” may be

the problem. While other programs have
already received funds from the USOC for
men’s gymnastics —— Big East rivals
Syracuse and Temple are among the nota-
bles —Pitt is at least three weeks away ﬁom
receiving even the vaguest dollar amotmt
ﬁorn the committee.

The main stumbling block to restarting
theprogram,accordingtoallconcemed,has
been the NCAA’s Title IX regulations. This
gender-equity act was the main force behind
the cancellation of mer1’s gymnastics and
men’s tennis at Pitt and could prevent a
renewal of the men’s team — regardless of
funding.

Aronson is well aware of the problems
T'1tlelXcancause, butstoppedshortofcrit-
icizing the legislation

“It’s a very sticky thing,” Aronson said
of Title IX. “I’m doing this very politically
correct.”

But Saleem was more candid. He called
the act “just a piece of paper,” saying the
regulations the paper contains have caused
more harm than good to collegiate sports.

Like Pitt, many schools chose to cut
men’s programs after the act’s passage,
instead of opening more doors to female
athletes.

Men’s gynmastics has been the victim
of many of these axes. Thanks to Title IX,
ﬁscal problems and other concerns, the
number of college men’s gymnastics teams
hasdroppedfrom l50to28overthelast 15
years.
“It should be enforced the way it was
meant to be,” said Saleem of Title IX, “and
