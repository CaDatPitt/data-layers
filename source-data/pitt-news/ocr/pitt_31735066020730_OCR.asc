more of a reality, especially in the

Morning show hosts Jimmy
Roach and Steve Hansen of
WMYG FM, or Magic 97, fol-
lowed their ratings into the toilet
on Friday; and, consequently,
they are no longer on the air.

According to station General
Manager Steu Cohen, the two ra-
dio personalities broadcast their
show from the station's men's
room because they were upset
that the rating of their show had
dropped from fifth in the nation
to 10th in the past three months.

”l’ve always been an en-
trepreneur, and I've always been.

McNeal, from Bryn Mawr, Pa.,
says one of her success secrets is

her ability to interact with people.
’’I approach people and I take

says. ‘
As a business owner, McNeal
stresses the importance of read-

it is a learning experience.

”got rather gross,” they were
taken off the air.

Cohen added that the two are
not angry at the radio station, nor
is the station angry with them.
They are angry at the ratings sys-
tem, which is conducted by Ar-
bitron.

”The sample base of listeners
used in conducting the survey is
ludicrously small; therefore, the
chance of the sample being vola-
tile increases,” said Cohen.

He added that because of this,
The jimmy and Steve Show drew
a short straw.

After Friday's incident, Roach,
Hansen and station managment
came to a mutual agreement to

cancel the show for an unspeci-
fied amount oftime, said Cohen.

According to Cohen, Roach
and Hansen may be at Pitt today
between 7:30 and 8 a.m. He did
not say why they are coming
here, nor what they will do. He
did say, however, that what they
do at Pitt could influence their
return to the air.

Cohen said that plans to come
to Pitt were announced by the
two men yesterday in his office.
He said they _left his office
screaming, ”Jimmy and Steve are
revolting!” Cohen explained that
they are revolting against the rat-
ing system.

Friday's broadcast did not

break any Federal Communica-
tions Commission rules, said
Cohen.

He added, however, ”The
sound effects were rude. They
didn't leave a lot to the imagi-
nation.”

When asked if he knew that the
pair would broadcast from the
restroom before they went on the
air, Cohen said that he respected
their creativity and approved the
broadcast.

Since Friday, Cohen has been
heard on the air apologizing for
the incident and asking listeners
not to call the station with their
questions.

King
recaﬂed
by BAS
tribute

By Adam Richter
Staff Writer

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s
birthday was commemorated last
night with a speech by Dr. Dor-
thy Cotton.

Cotton, the present director of
Student Activities at Cornell, said
that not enough people know
about the importance of the civil
rights movement of the 1950s
and 19605, citing as one case a
student at Cornell who did not
recognize a video tape of the fa-
mous ”freedom rides.”

”[The student saw] me in the -

old newsreels, and she said, ‘I
thought when they said ”civil
rights,” they were talking ”Civil
War.”’ It was ancient, ancient
history to her,” said-Cotton.

Cotton gave four reasons for
celebrating King's birthday. The
first reason, according to Cotton,
was that there are lessons to be
learned from King's life and
work.

”Yes, Dr. King had a dream,”
she said, ”but you also must have
a dream in order for us to go for-
ward. You ought to come clear
about what your vision is, and
what you can contribute to the
planet.”

The second reason, according
to Cotton, for celebrating King's
birthday is that when it was need-
ed, he provided the necessary
leadership. ”Dr. King had so pre-
pared himself,” Cotton said,
’’looking at how theologians had
projected some of their talk about

 applying [the Gospel] to peo-
ple's real problems.”

Third, Cotton said King's birth-
day should be celebrated for the
reason that he could communi-
cate people's problems and in-
spire hope in them.

Cotton’s final reason was that
King gave society the ”tool” of
non—violence, and he taught peo-
ple to love themselves and to
lead others.’ ’’If you do not love
yourself, you certainly cannot
love anybody else," or help
others, Cotton said. ’

Cotton’s appearance was spon-
sored by the Black Action Socie-
ty to celebrate King's 51 st
«birthday. The ceremony was held
in the Assembly Room of the Wil-
liam Pitt union.

 

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January I7, I989

Liberty Bell struck in honor of Martin Luther King 6

PHILADELPHIA (AP)
Proclaiming a rededication to the
ideas of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
and the principles of liberty,
black leaders symbolically rang
the Liberty Bell Monday as a sig-

- nal for bells to ring nationwide.

Mayor W. Wilson Goode and
Dr. Benjamin Hooks, president of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
as well as Hooks’ wife, Frances,
tapped the Liberty Bell with their
fists at 12:30 EST on the 60th
birthday of the slain civil rights
leader. -

As they struck the bell inside a
pavilion while several dozen
people and members of the me-
dia watched, a bell could be
heard ringing through Indepen-
dence National Historical Park.

C. Delores Tucker, of the
Philadelphia Martin Luther King
Center for Non-violence, said the
ringing of the bell symbolically
set off replicas of the famous
cracked bell in all 50 states. She
also said bells would ring at Big
Ben in London and in South
Africa.

”The crack is a symbol that

 

there are some things unful-
filled,” Goode said.

Goode and Hooks urged those
people who believed in Dr‘.
King's ideas to rededicate and
recommit themselves to dreams
for civil rights.

The ceremony has been held
for several years at the Liberty
Bell in Independence National
Historic Park. ‘

The bell is located inside a spe-
cial pavilion across the street
from Independence Hall, where
the bell was once located.’

Reagan bid farewell
by Soviet journalists

MOSCOW (AP) —- Soviet me- D

newspapers bid respectful and
even fond farewells Monday to
Reagan and his secretary of state,
George Shultz, for helping U.S.-.
Soviet relations.

of Western society,” the govern-
ment newspaper, Izvestia, said in

.a front—page article. ”But the re-

structuring of international rela-
tions could not bypass the White

» House.” ’

In 1984, Reagan quipped into
an open microphone that he
would begin bombing the Soviet
Union in five minutes. In the last
days of his presidency, however,
Soviets recall not those ”five
minutes” but his five summit
meetings with Mikhail S. Gor-
bachev, lzvestia said.

”And this is not because we
have short memories, but be-
cause a long road lies ahead of
us, which we can only overcome
together,” wrote the newspaper's
commentator, former U.,S.-based
correspondent Melor Sturua.

Pravda, the Communist Party
daily, painted an extraordinarily
intimate portrait of Shultz, Rea-
gan's secretary of state since July
1982, and declared: ’’It will be

Libyans suspected of

BON N, West Germany (AP) —
Finance Minister Gerhard Stolten-

believes that a Libyan chemical
factory is capable of producing
poison gas, according to a report
published Monday.

At a news conference Monday,
Stoltenberg again revised official
recollection of when Bonn first
learned of possible West German
involvement in the factory. He
also said a government company
may have unknowingly helped in
the factory’s construction.

A German magazine, mean-

PPC urges students to

sign up for spring trip

Every college student should
experience spring break in Day-
tona at least once, according to
Kristy Smith, the chairwoman of
the Pitt Program Council travel
committee.

That's why the PPC is sponsor-
ing its sixth annual spring break
trip to Daytona Beach from
March 3-12. Smith has gone on
the last three Daytona trips.

Studentswill stay at the Claren-
don Plaza Hotel, the best location

. in Daytona according to assistant

director of Student Affairs, Tom

new Marriott that's not taking‘ stu-
dents,” Misuraca said.

In addition to being located at
the center of activity in Daytona,
the hotel also plans special events
for students on spring break, such
as pool parties and trips to Dis-
ney World and Epcot Center.

Although other travel organiza-
tions have student representatives
on campus who are also offering
Daytona trips during spring
break, Misuraca said that the PPC
offers ”the best trip availablefor
the lowest cost.”

According to Misuraca, the
most important difference be-
tween the PPC trip and other trips
is that the PPC is a university or-
ganization, and students know
what they're getting with this trip.

’’In the past, at other campuses
I've worked at, people have taken
the money, cashed the checks,

— and nobody got a trip. I'm not ac-

cusing these people of that, -but

_ you know what you're going to

get if you come to us,”'Misuraca
said. -

Another important difference is
the mode of transportation to
Daytona. Students who go on the
PPC trip will ride in new wide-
body 102 buses.

These buses are the best buses

A available for road trips, according

to Misuraca. They have more
room than normal buses and
come equipped with television
monitors and a VCR so students
can watch movies .,

Shanty for homeless
should be firststep

Standing out on the grass in front of the William Pitt
Union is a shanty. Made of cardboard and wood, it exists
as a symbol of a problem here in Pittsburgh and across

the country.

Built by the Student Action Union, the shanty is part
of an effort to raise food and clothing for the homeless
of Pittsburgh. As part ofthe demonstration, some mem-
bers of the SAU will be living in this shanty over the next

week.

It is commendable that the SAU is making the effort to
help these people. Last year, a similar event raised $300
for the Rainbow Kitchen and the Greater Pittsburgh Food
Bank. The food and clothing being collected will make

 — life a little easier for many people with little or nothing

of their own. The problem, however, cannot be resolved

through simple charity.

The most important thing the SAU’s shanty will achieve
is the focusing of attention on the problem of the home-
less. The shanty is an eyesore on the groomed lawn of
the WPU and effectively represents the plight of home-
less people forced to wander in a supposed '’land of op-

portunity."

What the shanty must do is make people aware of a seri-
ous problem in Pittsburgh. People should not only give
the SAU canned goods and old clothes, but they must be-
come more informed about the problem of homelessness
and think about solutions that could be implemented, such
as increased employment opportunities.

In the long run, food will not solve the problem of home-»

lessness. We, as a community, must search for an answer. ..

way you expect something to be.

clusion about the way any given

say that college is turning out the
way you expected ?_ No? Not ex-
actly the picture that was paint-
ed in St. Elmo's Fire? We know
where you're coming from.

For those of you who are dis-
heartened by your parents’ insis-
tence that ”these are the best
years of your life,” just take com-
fort in this: happiness exists.

that seems to drag everyone
down, is the fact that ugliness and
horror are prevalent, and beauty
and joy are somewhat obscure.

lated caves, some might say.)
That doesn't make them inacces-
sible; it just makes them a little
harder to find. '

Parents who helpkids too much

I receive a lot of interesting
calls at my office. My favorite so
far this year was from a mother
who lives in Bethesda‘, Md.

”I wonder if you'd mind an-
swering some questions on the
U.S.-Soviet missile treaty?” she
said.

"I would be happy to," I told
her. "Why‘do you ask?" 9

”My son is home from college

AR-T.
BUCHWALD

and he has to write a term paper
on disarmament.”

"I see. Why doesn't your son
call’ me himself?”

”He's very busy. He needs to
get his car tuned, and the only
time he can see his girlfriend is
when he comes home.”

”Don’t you think there is some-

thing wrong with a son asking his V
_ mother to do his term paper for

him?" I

’’I don't mind,” she replied.
"There is so little he needs from
me these days. Was it Reagan's
idea or Gorbachev's to reduce
the missiles in -Europe?"

”Look, ma’am, I don't mind an-

more interesting.

No, no, only kidding. What we
suggest you do is go out there
and find happiness. Hunt it down
under rocks and behind damp
bath towels. Search the sewers,
drain the swamps. (Hey, evenif
you don't find happiness, exact-
ly, you're liable to discover some-
thing interesting this way.)

You're wondering, what the
point is, aren't you? Well, the
point is that expectations will
murder you in cold blood every
time. When you expect the best
of something, you get the worst.
And when you start out with the
lowest possible expectations,

.you’re on a fast train headed for

self-mutilation.

Face it, when your worst ex-
pectations aren’t met, you're still
disappointed.

Don't expect anything. Life will
be full of surprises. Who knows,
maybe even pleasant ones.

‘Don't roll into a new situation
with a lot of expectations, de-

mands and other crazy ideas.v

swering your questions, but if you
do the work, your son isn't going
to get anything out of it.”
' ”Oh, yes, he will. If the paper
is any good, they'll give him an
A.” .

"That's not what I mean.
-Mothers shouldn't be writing
term papers for their children."

"Why not? We pay their
tuition.”

”The term paper itself is not im-
portant — gathering the research
for it is-what helps make the
scholar.” A

”Well, I’m sure my son would
research the material if he could
spare the time. He was never lazy
when he lived at home."

”Whose idea was it for you to
dothis paper?”

"Both of ours. He kept com-

. plaining that his entire vacation
was being ruined because he had i

to look up facts about ICBMs.
Since I didn't have any other
commitments, I volunteered to
help him. After all, he is flesh and
blood.” ,

I didn't know what to tell her.
”Somehow I feel party ‘to a
crime,” I said.

”Mrs. Lipkin always helped her
son Milton with his papers, and

Say, for example, you think you

In spite of your mutual friend's
predictions of doom, you make a

PERSPECTIVE

THE PITT NEWS

No ‘hypocrisy’ in U.S. policy

I don't normally write editori-
als, or responses to editorials no
matter how much I question the
intelligence level of some of the
authors in The Pitt News.
However, on Jan. 12, Michael
Smith wrote an editorial on Rea-
gan’s ”hypocrisy” with respect to

chemical weapons procurement. .

This struck just a little too close
to home for me not to deal with.
I am a veteran of the U.S. Army

LETTERS

Chemical Corps. I was honorably
discharged last May as a sergeant
in charge of nuclear, biological,
and chemical warfare defense for
a Lance missile battalion in West

"Germany. I also served as an as-

sistant instructor for a year and a

. half at a military school for these

types of warfare. Having_said
that, I feel I'm qualified to
respond to Mr. Smith's accu-
sations. '
-First Mr. Smith states, quite cor-
rectly, that Reagan said he
”would abide by_the I972 treaty

. that banned virtually all chemical

and biological weapons.” Mr.
Smith goes on to say that [Rea-
gan] (hypocritically?) ”has allot-
ted $17 million for
development of chemical
warfare.”

Does Mr. Smith understand the
U.S. policies on the use of these
types of ‘weapons? It is quite ob-
vious [that] he does not. The Unit-
ed States has unilaterally banned
the use of biological weapons.
The $90 million budget for bio-
logical weapon development cit-
ed by Mr. Smith is for research in
biological defense. The Soviets
have always maintained biologi-
cal weapons inventories and still
do. We need to be able to defend
ourselves with inoculations, an-
tidotes, etc. The only way we
may do this is through research.
[...]

As far as the chemical weapons
policygoes, Mr. Smith is  seri-
ously mistaken. The policy of the

the -

United States on chemical
weapons is ”no first use.” We
will not use chemical weapons
without being provoked in kind.
However, we do and always
have reserved the right to
respond in kind. Reagan has stat-
ed again and again that the
money for our chemical weapons
development is not to increase,
but to replace our existing stock-
piles of chemical weapons. [...]

Yes, the Reagan administration
vowed to uphold the 1972 treaty
on chemical weapons, and I can't
see any instance where [it has]
failed to do so. I would like to ad-
vise Mr. Smith to check his infor-
mation more closely before he
jumps into Reagan-bashing again.
I would also like to advise the
readers of The Pitt News to not
take everything [they] read" as
gospel.

Derek Viljoen

Hypocrisy in The Pitt News is
nothing new, right? But it seems
that Michael Smith has made an
art of it in his article ”The dangers
of chemical weapons for all
countries.” What Smith believes
about chemical and biological
weapons and the true facts about
the subject are so different that
it's hard to believe.

Here are a few things that
Michael Smith said about chem-
ical and biological weapons in
his article. He mentioned ’’...the
1972 treaty that banned virtually

all chemical and biological

weapons.” This treaty does not
ban any chemical weapons; it
bans only biological ones. The

only treaty concerning chemical A

weapons is the Geneva Protocol
of 1925, which bans the use (not
the development, production or
stockpiling) of chemical

_ weapons. So Smith's self-defined

”illegal weapons” are nothing of
the kind.

Also mentioned is that the
[United States’] chemical stock--
pile is ”...growing larger and

more dangerous.” The chemical
stockpile is not growing larger.
The congressional bill which
provided funding for the binary
agents requires the destruction of
one old weapon for every new
one produced, and in any case
the Army began destroying obso-
lete weapons in the early 1980s.
The U.S. stockpile has actually
decreased since 1981. [...]

Smith also mentions
government's budget increases
for ”biological weapons.” The
United States possesses no bio-
logical weapons, which are ille-
gal under the 1972 treaty. What
is actually done with this money
is develop defenses against other
countries’ biological weapons.

Although Michael Smith
prefers to observe the issue of
chemical and biological weapons
through red-shaded glasses, I be-
lieve the readers of The Pitt News
would prefer a realistic look at
this important issue.

Evans totally wrong

This letter is in response to Paul
Evans’ remarks in The Pitt News
Tuesday, Jan. 10, and in other
Pittsburgh newspapers.

[...] Where does Paul Evans get
off saying the fans and their de-
votion are disadvantaging his

-team? [In reference] to the Boston

College game, I observed many
fans sitting in‘: the aisles of the
bleachers‘ia‘nd an thefloor. They

taunted Dana Barros, cheered on -

Pat Cavanaugh’s guarding efforts,
stomped on the bleachers, and
many voices were-lost [that]
Saturday night. 

‘ V I have a high respect for Coach

Paul Evans, the Pitt basketball
program, and the players. Evans’
record does speak for itself, and
most of the fans are listening. We
are the enthusiastic fans who are
tired of being called ignorant. [...]

Pitt's long line of paperwork

”Next!” The words I waited
two hours to hear,'as I waited at
Thackeray Hall, were barked at

. me by.some old lady-wearing

green polyester.

She snatched the forms out of
my hand faster than Dan Quayle
can zip his ski jacket.

”What’s that? No, I don't have
a-copy of my bill.”

Hence began the seemingly
never-ending series of GOTO
commands.

GOTO THE SECOND FLOOR!

”I can't have a copy of my bill

‘ because there's a financial hold

on my account? But I can't pay
my bill without it.”
I was beginning to see myself

_ as that little wimpy guy in the

Wendy's commercial — Step
aside, please step aside.
’ A GOTO SPECIAL ACCOUNTS!

There was a sign on the door:

1 ”Enter Here.” An hour later, I.en-

tered there, and a 6-foot-4',

-  247-pound hulk’ of a. woman,

‘   ‘With»¢irI°9ki-W‘ wouldsend Paul

Evans running, looked me dead
in the face and bellowed, ”Move
down to the light switch, stand
against the wall, and don't block‘
the doorway.”

The guy behind me whispered,
”Just do as she says.” ’

Mad visions began running
through ‘my head. Words like
”late fee,” _”cance|Iation,” ”un-
educated washed-up bum” were
causing beads of sweat to form
on my brow.

”I can't have the hold on my
account released because I have
an outstanding balance? But what
about my financial aid?”

GOTO BRUCE HALL!

”Sign in and sit down.” By
now I was asking myself, do they
know that I pay their salaries?

As I sat there waiting, I flashed
[back to last March. I know I had
my FAF, PHEAA and GSL forms
sent to Iowa City by April I. I

know this because they were due .

before taxes, so my parents had
to estimate their income for the
year, which ended upbeing off
by $43.26, resulting in a mid-July
audit. I , , ’
”What do you mean, where's

that green card. Yes, I have it right
here. What? You mean I could
have just shown this to that poly-
ester babe at Thackeray? You
mean I skipped three classes,
blew off work, and missed Days
of Our Lives for this?!”

Outraged and in no mood to
piss around, I retraced my steps
from theafternoon, accordingly
presenting this oh—so-powerful
green postcard to anyone who
would look at it.

Finally, two sets of Walkman
batteries later, I reached the end,
the great conclusion; the fat lady
has sung. All the crap, the lines,
the red tape comes down to a lit-
tle, shiny, blue sticker. No one
but a Pitt student could know
what power this little rite of pas-
sage holds in life at this
bureaucratic, pain-in_-the-ass
place.

I grabbed the valued prize and
informed the demon woman,
”You’re fired!”

asked myself, do I put this on my

A pox on smokers

I was in a small, confined
waiting room the other day,
and some guy I don't even
know lit a cigar and practical-
ly blew the smoke in my face.
I turned my attention from my
book to this guy and told him
that I thought it was very rude
of him to light a cigar around
me without asking if I minded.

   

He replied, ”I’l| smoke dis ci-
gar if I want to. I don't need

MARK
your approval.”

, _ STAF
This comment didn't go

over to big with me. I rose, stepped out of the room, went to
the nearest drug store and bought a tin of Skoal chewin’ tobac-
co. I loaded up my cheek a_n_d gum full of this pollutant snuff

I stuff, came back to the room and sat down right. next to this

rude hog. After a minute of heavy salivation, I got right up in
his face and said, ”This is what it is like when your foul cigar
smoke comes into my air.” I leaned foward and spit a stream
of dark brown tobacco juice at his ugly face.

After I ran like hell, I thought that it was the rudest thing in
the world for that toilet merchant to sit next to me and blow
his combination bad breath/second-hand smoke in my face and
space.‘Yeah, sure, even though it's a filthy habit, it is this butt-
head's constitutional right to smoke. But more importantly, it
is my constitutional right to breathe the cleanest air possible.
Not everyone enjoys the aroma of a fine I8—cent cigar. It is just
common courtesy and the teaching of many a prophet to think
of others before you think of yourself. " .

Think about it this way: If we have regulations for the amount

of toxins that a car can produce and take companies to the‘

Supreme Court for polluting water with life-threatening and dan-
gerous chemicals, then how can we justify people polluting our
immediate airspace with life-threatening and dangerous chem-
icals? Forget the fact that the smoke is offensive to those who
do not smoke. Fine. More important, second—hand cigarette
smoke is dangerous and even more carcinogenic than the ac-
tual cigarette itself.

It's not fair to those who deliberately choose not to breathe
cigarette smoke and risk not being super-cool by avoiding smok-
ing to have someone else force you to breathe smoke by smok-
ing in your airspace. This threatens the health of a non—smoker
who, in turn, is an innocent victim. '

Here's a good example: As I was writing this column last

night, one of the obnoxious smokers, who writes for The Pitt_

News and polluted the air I was breathing as I wrote this, came
up to me and — as a totally immature joke — blew some smoke
in my face. That's fine. He and brainless people like him are
the reason that smoking has become illegal in so many places
in the first place. Besides, the next time I go out boozing, I'll
make it a point to vomit on him.

I talked to a few non—smoking Pitt students who have made
some good points. The most important message that students

convey is that they are laid back about the issue but just want .

to see more courtesy on the part of smokers. Dalel'Kha|il, a
Pitt junior, thinks that it's OK for people to smoke but that they
should definitely follow an etiquette rule. She said, ”General-
Iy, it doesn't bother me that people smoke, as long as they are
not rude or abusive with their cigarette smoke.”

Vershetta Johnson, a Pitt sophmore, told me a story about

someone she knew who had his eye burned by a lit cigarette. _
Still, she's basically passive about the issue as well. Vershetta’s ‘

point is clear and simple: ”If you're gonna smoke, be
courteous.”

One non-smoker who is very firm on his opinion cracked my
lid. They call him Big Jim. He is. a dude who stands almost
6-foot-6 and weighs about 300 pounds. He told me about a time
when some smoker told him basically what the cigar-smoking
hog told me. It seems that Jim lost his temper. ”I grabbed the
little weasel by the neck and punched him as hard as I could...
twice.”

My argument is clear: Be courteous and all will be har-
monious. , ' -

One more thing: Before you smokers out in readerland have
a you—know-what fit and send me a ton of mail quoting the Con-

stitution of the United States of America, let me tell you to not

waste any more paper. Because I) My secretary opens, reads
and throws out any mail that is anti-Stafetic; and 2) I'm not say-
ing that I want smoking to be prohibited. Hell, smoke your lungs
out. Just respect the right ofthe non-smoker who finds your
smoke offensive and annoying. If you can't do that, non-
smokers, who are the majority, will keep on passing more and
more legislation to ban smoking. I
And if that doesn't work, Big Jim and The Skoal Chewers (now

a semifamous rock band heard frequently on WPTS) are. gonna ,.
, teach you some manne_rs, dudemeyer. I

°He’s   back!

Brookin

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

It was not your average day for
Rod Brookin.

The average day for Rod
Brookin has involved coming off
the Pitt bench, playing about 21
minutes, scoring around eight
points and avoiding the press af-
terward. There is something
about thispast Sunday that made
Rod Brookin just a little different.

’’I didn't eat breakfast,”
Brookin said after he helped the
Panthers beat the third—ranked
Oklahoma Sooners, 99-91, by
scoring 24 points in 32 minutes
of playing time. _

It wasn't only that aspect that
gave Brookin a little extra incen-
tive. Since he came back to the
team (Brookin missed the last half
of last season due to academic

-43,. problems), Brookin’s weight has

C
, basketball court, but it carries on

‘I don't expect something exactly

been a big subject for discussion.
He did balloon up to about 260
pounds (according to Coach Paul
Evans) when practice started back
in November, dropped a little,
then rose again. Now he is at
about 235, Evans said Sunday.
The Pitt basketball media guide
lists Brookin at a conservative

- 230.
--‘G

’’I did get a little sick and tired
. of hearing about my weight,” the
6—foot-5 forward (who broke his
se|f—imposed silence to talk about
his performance and, in some
cases, his life) said. ”lt didn't
bother me, though. If I  let that
bother me, I'm not going to be a
good player. I'm not going to
listen to what other people say
about me. -
”Not only does it_carry onto the

in life. You can't worry about
what people think of you. That is
the way I was raised by my par-

ents, and it has carried over

through all of the difficulties l
have had.”
Most of all, it was Oklahoma

x$S'nK°' ..

that got Brookin fired up.

”He said before the game that
he was ready to play,’’ Evans
said.

Two years ago, in the second
round of the NCAA tournament,
a Pitt team that featured the likes
of Charles Smith and Jerome Lane
lost 96-93 to the Sooners. in that
game, the freshman version of
Brookin scored a _then—career high
of23 points. He didn't play in last
year's game, an 86-83 Pitt loss.

This time around, Rockin’ Rod
wanted to show what he was
made of. \ '

”Rod has worked real hard,”
Evans said. ”He just needed a
game to get going, and maybe
this was the one.”

Brookin looked ready to play as
soon as he checked in, scoring on
'a layup following a steal, and get-
ting fouled -in the process. As the
ball went through the hoop,
Brookin threw his arms in the air

 a .

in an effort to get the crowd go-
ing. That basket brought Pitt to
within one point.

A minute later, he tied the
game by hitting the second of two
free throws. By the time intermis-
sion rolled around, Brookin had
compiled 13 points (second
highest on the team to Brian
Shorter’s 22). He was on his way
to having the kind of afternoon
that was promised after he was
named to the Big East All-

Whoops.' —. It's the ’Niners and

”As for the upcoming season,

like the iconoclastic year of
1981, when the upstart Bengals
and upstart 49ers, two teams not
even predicted to have winning
records, charged off the depths
and into a Cinderelia Super
Bowl.” —— Dr. D's NFL preseason
forecast in the Aug. 3 I, 1988 is-
sue of The Pitt News.

last season, before the Minneso-
ta Vikings unceremoniously
ground them into the mud of

' Candlestick Park in the first round

of the playoffs. It was a bitter off-
season and a roller coaster ride
through the regular season for the
team, but the ’Niners are back,
seeking theirthird world champi-
onship.

On the other side of the field,
Cincinnati, an explosive 12-4
team this year, finished a misera-
ble 4-11, last in the AFC Central
only a year ago. That's where the
surprise lies, in Cincy’s unexpect-
ed rise to the top. Head coach
Sam.Wyche, who, until this sea-
son, had a foot and four toes out
the door due to his team's less-

one.

  

DANYLUK

What San Francisco did in the _

playoffs this year was utterly in-

: 1 credible.“ After an unspectacular.

10-6 regular season campaign,
which included blowout losses to
Atlanta (34-17), the Rams (38-16)
and the L.A. Raiders (9-3; yes,
when considering what a jokester
unit the Raiders defense is, that
was a blowout too), the 49ers cut
up Minnesota 34-9, then neu-
tered the snarling Chicago Bears
in the NFC title game with a Gin-
su knife also known as Montana's
right arm, 28-3.

This is not your typical 49er Su-
per Bowl team, though. This is a
team in high transistion, a very
young group of players blessed
with valuable leadership ex-
perience in some crucial posi-
tions. Only five starters remain
from San Francisco's last Super
Bowl appearance in 1984 —
Montana, running back Roger
Craig, safety Ronnie Lott, center

‘ Randy Cross and linebacker Kee-

na Turner, who provide a corner-
stone in practically every area of
the field for the team —' while the

Rod Brookin didn't do much sitting on Sunday, scoring alcareer-high 24 points in Pitt's 99-91 upset of Oklahoma.

”Not to underestimate the
other guys, but Brookin was a key
to the game [Sunday]/’. Oklaho-
ma Coach Billy Tubbs said.

Brookin said. ’’I hope that I can
continue to do the best I possibly
can.”

seven starters. ,
Craig, the starting fullback for

the 1984 NFL champs, has since

slimmed down and been moved

' to tailback, where he has become

the league's most physical run-
ning back, pound for pound,
since Earl Campbell. This year,
Craig and Eric Dickerson of the
Indianapolis Colts both led the
league in total yards with 2,036
rushing and receiving.

Montana battled "injuries and
his youthful challenger Steve
Young for the rights to the quar-

terback position for much of the _

regular season, then snapped
back at critics by firing six touch-
down passes in the playoffs, in-
cluding five to All-Pro wide
receiver Jerry Rice. 9

Turner, Cross and the hard-

hitting Lott, all in, the twilight of
their careers, still play the game
with the fervor of a trio of rookies.

While the rest of the team prac-— ‘

tically is a squad of rookies.

MIAMI — Forget about the in-
juries, the coaches, or the quar-
terbacks. The most crucial bit of
information a handicapper needs
to know about this Super Bowl is
that the San Francisco 49ers are
staying at a hotel near Miami In-
ternational Airport all this week,
and their wives may be staying
downtown.

That's why the diminutive Dr.
Ruth, who knows plenty about
that kind of thing but next to

’ nothing about football, is leaning

toward the Cincinnati Bengals.

' For most of the week, at least,

they'll know who's where —— and
when.

’’I think in many cases, couples
being apart will create more ten-
sion than good,” the noted sex
therapist said Monday in a tele-
phone interview from Los
Angeles.

”For one thing, maybe she is
going to ask him, ’Where were
you last night?’ And then he's go-
ing to ask her the same thing.”

Men and women have been
asking one another that ever
since Adam lost a rib and gained
a partner. Football coaches didn't
pose the question to their charges
until several centuries later, but
some of the stories have been
good enough to more than make
up for lost time.

And one of the very best came

from the very first Super Bowl
and Green Bay wide receiver
Max McGee, who was as adept
at making passes off the field as
he was at catching them on it.

On the night ofJan. 14, 1967,
less than 24 hours before the
Packers were scheduled to play
Kansas City, a team official told
McGee after an initial bed check
that there wouldn't be another
one.

”That was enough for me. I
practically ran over him getting
out of the room,” McGee said in
the book Lombard, written by
Green Bay teammate Jerry
Kramer.

”I met some blonde the night
before, and I was on my way to
pay my respects. I didn't feel I
was letting the team" down any
because I knew there wasn't a
chance in hell I'd play.

”| waddled in about 7:30 in the
morning,” he said, ”and I could
barely stand up for the kickoff.
On the bench, Paul [Hornung, his
roommate] kept needling me,
‘What would you do if you had
to play?’ And I said, ‘No way,
there's no way I could make it.’ ”

When McGee‘ heard Coach
Vince Lombardi call his name
early in the game, he figured he’d
been caught sneaking out and ex-
pected to get slapped with a
$5,000’fine. It turned out to be
worse; front—liner Boyd Dowler
had injured his shoulder leadin
the Green Bay sweep. —

 Sex and the Super Bowl —  
 Dr. Ruth picks the victor

”Get in the game,” Lombardi
barked.

”I almost fainted,”
recalled.

He stayed up long enough to
catch seven passes for 137 yards
and two touchdowns — starting
a Super Bowl tradition of party-
ing hardy and playing well that
was enriched by such late—night
legends as Broadway Joe Namath
of the New York Jets, John
Matuszak of the Oakland Raiders
and Jim McMahon of the Chica-
go Bears.

Which brings us to Dr. Ruth's

McGee

. second reason for leaning toward

Cincinnati. The team's policy on
visits, conjugal and otherwise,
appears a little more relaxed.
Though both’ teams will se-
quester their players the Saturday
night before the Super Bowl, the
49ers require that for all games
home and away. '
Bengals are allowed around the
house when they're in Cincinna-
ti, which just might help explain
why they were one of just two
NFL clubs to go unbeaten at
home. -

Leave it to Penn State. They'll
do anything to beat Pitt.

Witness to that fact the men's
swimming meet last Saturday at
Trees Pool.

The Nittany Lions came in
shaved and tapered, while Pitt
was in a hard training cycle, nor-
mal for this time of the year. The
result was slower Panther times
because of their cycle and a
151-92 PSU victory. The loss, in
Pitt's last home dual meet of the
year, drops their record to 5-2.

’_'Normally at this time of the
year, teams agree not to shave
against each other if they're
championship-caliber teams,
which Penn State [as well as Pitt]
are,” said men's swimming
coach Dick Bradshaw.

”I really thought we'd beat this
team. We thought they'd come in
more or less equal in regards to
training. They've swum very con-
sistently all year, very predict-
ably, and all of a sudden they
show up here swimming the kind
of times you do at the‘ end of the

Super Bowl

to Cost

(AP) — The University of Pitts-
burgh will name its new indoor
sports complex the Charles L.

Cost Sports Center to honor a.

former three-sport letterman who
donated more than $1 million to
the project.

Cost, a Pittsburgh contractor

‘ who played football, basketball

and baseball at Pitt from 1956-58,
said, "The new facility will help
Pitt remain competitive at its lev-
el of commitment to its athletic
programs.”

The Cost Sports Center, expect-
ed to be completed in the spring
of 1990, is being built atop a
seven-story parking garage adja-
cent to Pitt Stadium. It will con-
tain a regulation-sized football
field and "multipurpose playing
surface and can be used for bad
weather football practices.

The complex will contain nine
regulation-sized tennis courts.
Five Pitt athletic teams, as well as
the university's band and cheer-
leaders, will practice» there.

season,” added Bradshaw.

Pitt captured only two of 11
swimming events as well as both
diving events, which are not af-
fected by cycles.

Mike Kozlina captured the
200—meter backstroke in 1:51.22,
nearly three seconds faster than
the closest Lion.

Tim Adams beat two shaved
PSU swimmers to win the 50
freestyle in 21.22 seconds.

"Timmy did a great job. For a
guy to beat someone while he
was unshaved and they. were
shaved is fantastic,” said
Bradshaw.

John Sharkey and Vernon Ye-
nick each won a diving event.
Sharkey took the 1-meter and
finished second to Yenick in the
3-meter. Yenick was squeezed
out of second place in the
1-meter by little more than a
point but came back strong to
take the 3-meter. Mike Naylor
finished fourth in both events.

Diving coach Julian Krug was

not entirely satisfied with the
team's performances, however.

'’I’m a little disappointed that
we didn't see NCAA cuts today,

but I really do expect several of
our people to get them in the next
few weeks,” said Krug.

Bradshaw, however, was much
happier with the results.

"I was very pleased with our
times. Our whole team swam the
best unshaved times of their
lives,” said Bradshaw.

"We weren't equal today be-
cause of our philosophy, not be-
cause of our kids. We don't
believe in giving up the rest of the
season just for a dual meet. They
did a good job on us, but they
were rested and shaved and we
weren't; but I didn't expect it.

”However, I'm proud of the
fact that we're doing it the way
that we are. I really can't believe
they'll do much better the rest of

A the year,” said Bradshaw.

‘I think we'll swim better than
they will [at the Eastern Seaboard
Championships in March] be-
cause of this meet now,” Brad-
shaw added.

Other top finishers for Pitt in-
cluded Kozlina, who finished a

close second in the 200 freestyle ‘

and Bill Folger, who finished
fourth. John Kesler finished a

the organization. Yes, Sweet OI’
Bill is Cincinnati's biggest threat,
and the Bengals won't be able to
do anything about his influence
unless they sneak over to the
sideline, stuff Walsh into a Gato-
rade cooler and Federal Express
him to Bora Bora. Heck, Walsh
is probably even prepared for
something like that. .
Cincinnati has a lot of great ta-
lent on its roster. Quarterback
Boomer Esiason is the league's
best lefty since Ken Stabler; Ick-

ey Woods is doing a nice job at
fullback, and Cincy's secondary
is one of the most punishing in
the league.

But the AFC and the NFC,
although evenly matched during
the regular season, become two
different levels of play when it
comes down to crunchtime, as
past Super Bowls have blatantly
proven. The National Conference
has won six of the past eight
meetings without serious effort,

Pls Cesari saving his best for last?

‘ By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

. Joe Cesari is hoping to save the
best for last.

Cesari, one of Pennsylvania's
best-known scholastic coaches, is
spending his 23rd and last season
as the only wrestling coach North
Schuylkill High School has ever
had. Few state coaches have ever
matched his 345-30-2 career
record, but, after this season,
Cesari will concentrate on his job
as the district's assistant superin-
tendent.

With his Spartans atop the state
Class AA rankings, Cesari, 47,
would like nothing better in his
final season than to win his se-
cond PIAA title. Led by returning
state champion Mark Cesari, the
coach's son, North Schuylkill will
be one of the Class AA favorites
in Hershey this March.

“I've been asked constantly
how this team compares to our
1983 (state title) team,” Cesari
said Monday in a telephone in-
terview. ”We’ve had a couple of
teams come real close, finish se-
cond,’ but no other team has won
a state title. And until somebody
else wins it, I can't compare any
team to our 1983 team.”

The 1983 Spartans had only
one PIAA champion 3 138-pound
junior Joe Cesari, who won the

second of his three titles 8 but
produced 744 points with top—to—
bottom balance. No other Class
AA team came close to matching
that figure until Benton outpoint-
ed the Spartans 874-73 to win last
year's title.

The PIAA tournament is two
months down the road, and, be-
fore that, the Spartans havedual
meets have against two of the
state's premier teams, Shikellamy
and Line Mountain. The Line
Mountain match Feb. 11 has
been moved from that school's
tiny gym to the more spacioius,
3,000-seat gym at nearby
Shamokin.

”When we wrestled them two
years ago, so many people
couldn't get a ticket they showed
it on c|osed—circuit,” Cesari said.

Besides coping with the suc-
cess and pressure that accompa-
ny any highly ranked team, North
Schuylkill will be closely
watched the rest of the season be-
cause of last week's Sports Illus-
trated feature story, titled, ”Gold
Amid the Coal.”

The four-page story praised
Cesari, a former college football

player with no previous wrestling,

experience, for building a suc-
cessful athletic program in a hard-
hat area hard hit by the decline
of the anthracite coal industry.

Wrestling _

Super hype detracts
from the Super Bowl

By Dave Goldberg

AP Football Writer

MIAMI —— Boomer Esiason
came prepared for his role as
a central figure in the pre-
Super Bowl hoopla that may
overshadow his role in the
game itself.

The Cincinnati Bengals
quarterback even knew some
of the questions.

”No, I haven't been asked
yet what kind of tree I'd like
to be or how long I've been a
white quarterback,” Esiason
said at his unofficial unveiling .
for the Super Bowl press
corps. That came Sunday, a
day before the official Esiason

J unveiling Monday night.

Was Esiason joking?
Hardly. ,
Anycoach. who has ever
been to a Super Bowl knows
that no matter how hard he
tries, he can never prepare his
players for the cameras, tape
recorders, pens and pencils
with which they will be as-
saulted for most of the week
building up to Sunday's game.
’’I love the idea of making it
here, but I don't love every-
thing that goes with it,” said

» San Francisco Coach Bill

Walsh, whose 49ers won in
1982 and 1985 and are seek-
ing to become the first team
this decade to win three NFL
titles. ' 8

What goes withit are ques-
tions like the ones to which El-
way referred. _

”How long have youbeen
a black quarterback?" Doug
Williams was asked last year
before he led Washington to

its 42-10 win over Denver.

”lf youwere a tree, what
kind of tree would you be?”
one reporter asked every play-

. er she could find last year, and

another asked:

, Bourbon Street

”I’ve just talked to the Top
Gun pilots and they say they
admire you. What do you
think of them?” -

”We|l, you've hit the
beach,” was the first thing a
reporter said to Esiason.

”Yes,” he replied and went
on to otherthings.

While a handful of coaches
and players met with a relative
handful of reporters Sunday
and Monday, the brunt of the
work for the players starts on
Tuesday, the misnamed ”Pic-
ture Day.” V

That's when not only pho-
tographers, but every other
form of media life descends on
Joe Robbie Stadium for a ses-

- sion with the players. All ‘are

required to make themselves
available — under threat of a
$5,000 fine — for an hour
each day.

That didn't sit particularly
well a couple of years ago
with Mark Bavaro, the talent-
ed but monosyllabic tight end
‘of the New York Giants. He
showed up at the assigned
time in uniform, posed for the ,
cameras, then disappeared
back onto the team bus before
a small army of questioners
could get to him.

Asked later why he had dis-
appeared, Bavaro replied: ”It
was picture day.  They took
my picture.  I left.” I

In 1985, it was Jim McMa-
hon, Chicago's offbeat quarter-
back, who was the object of
the media crush, first because
