BAS gets
students
to show ,
off talent

by Becky Reiser
Stzzﬁ’ Writer

President Barack Obama might
have been inaugurated Tuesday, but
the Black Action Society continued to
celebrate the historic event through-
out its annual “Black Week”

Last night, students ﬁlled the ball-
room of the William Pitt Union to

watch the armual talent show hosted ,

by BAS. In addition to BAS members,
the group also invited other student
groups to showcase their talents

“We have this [event] at least once
a year for fun, to show the talent that
Pitt has,” said Cherise Ponder, BAS
community outreach chair.

Gary Curtis, this year’s host, was
asked to emcee at the last minute but
was enthusiastic throughout the per-
forrnance,  shout outs between
the eight acts to ﬁaternities, soronties
and Obama, as Well as the Steelers

The first group to perform was
Axe Capoeira, Pitt’s Brazilian Martial
Art Club. Club president Tasha Kim-
ball said that BAS invited them

‘We like to support school events
like this because it’s a_ good chance to
teach people about Capoeira ...' it’s a
little obscure,” she said

Last minute entries gave the event
a coffee house feel, with acoustic
guitar performances by both Ethan
Cohen and Adam Phillips and an im-
provisational performance at the end
by a non-Pitt student  Stevie
Wonders “lately”

“I -heard there was an opportunity
to play;’’ said‘Cohen, who strurnmed
an original song titled “Baby.”

“I hadn’t played ir1 a while and
wanted to perform,” he said. I

In addition to musical stylings, Ja-
millia Kamara performed a spoken

Pennsylvania education offi-
cials proposed a new, unique way
of receiving higher—level educa-
tion this Wednesday.

The officials surfacedthe idea
of opening new colleges" aimed
at one thing: providing their stu-
dents an affordable way to obtain
a bachelor’s degree in as quick
and efficient a manner as pos-
sible, according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette.

The proposed schools would
offer an education —— and not
much else. In an effort to reduce
the schools’ tuition fees, they
would be stripped bare of all

extracurricular activities, sports

plush dormitories.
Most colleges and universities
heavily advertise the very aspects

schools would forego. Regard-
less, the straight-to-the—point
style of education could be very
beneﬁcial for certain types of
college students.

This type of school might ca-
ter to the needs of students look-
ing for a different style of edu-
cation. The schools would offer
four—year ‘degrees but would cut

_ the time it takes to earn them by

implementing year—round pro-
grams.

Some fresh high school grad-
uates opt to take a year or two
off before heading to college to
work or travel. These students
could still receive theif degrees at
the same time they would have,
had they entered college right

A from high school. I

Furthermore, such schools

would provide an attractive al-

EDITORIAL

~ Pennsylvania should
launch no frills schools

teams, fancy fitness centers and

of college life that such new,

. Bare education a ﬁnancial solution

ternative for adults looking to go
back and ﬁnish a degree or even
begin their pursuit of a degree.
Upper level education in
Pennsylvania is by no means in-

_ expensive. Pennsylvania is the

sixth most expensive state in the
country for students to acquire a
college education, according to a

report released by the state board ‘

in November.’ The average cost
of education in the state is $532
more than the national average.

Sure, community colleges of-
fer an" inexpensive opportunity
for education.

' But the new schools would al-
low affordable four—year degrees
instead of the associate degrees
offered by most community col-
leges. .

Putting these new schools
into service would cost the state
money,And they’d be a better in-
vestment for the state than subsi-
dizing existing schools. 1

While the state pulled back
funding to the some of the state-
owned and state-related schools
this year — including Pitt — a
state—issued check to these uni-
versities might be used to pay for
non—acadernic expenditures.

Educational institutions like
Pitt have many more facets to
put money toward than schools

that do not offer a plethora of 4

student—related, extracurricular
groups and activities.

Currently these new schools
remain in a theoretical state.
However, Pennsylvania should
quickly implement the schools
to expedite the administrational
processes involved with opening
new schools. -

Korman canscold Complaints

by Ben Korman
Colammldt

I’ve always been fond of the an-
nual phenomenon knownin temper.-
ate climate zones as “winter.” Snow
is fun to play with. The comforting
abilities of hot cocoa have been well
documented. The stylistic virtues of
the beanie are, in my opinion, largely
unheralded. Also, my birthday oc-
curs during winter.

But one  about winter I
can’t stand is the incessant com-

plaining about the cold that people-
seem to feel obligated to engage 

Not only is it extremely negative, it’s
also unconstructive.

There is not some democratic
meteorological‘ overlord listening in

. on our trivial banter for constructive

criticism regarding his current mod-
el in order to determine possible av-
enues for improvement, Face it:It is
cold outside, and there is absolutely
nothing we can do about it;

This is why I have resolved, for

thefentire winter, not to complain
_ even once about the cold, nor any

of its meteorological ' brethren.
This includes but is not limited to:

snow, sleet,  slush and icebergs.

I I briefly considered allowing myself

to gripe about “wind chill,” but this
would have been one of those an-

Thrice. The band’s been pumping out
fast, blaring, guitar-assaulting rock for
the better part of a decade now, and it’s
gotten better with each record
- Kensrue’s solo work, though, is
straight-ahead singer—songwriter fare
laced with his gravelly yell one moment
and delicate the next .

Brother helps Dixon ﬁnd shot

by Zack Chakan
Aimirtarzt Sparta E9itor

Pitt junior guard Jermaine
Dixon struggled through the ear-
ly part of the season to ﬁnd his
outside shot. Despite displaying
lock-down defense and starting at
shooting guard for the Panthers,
Dixon couldn’t make an impact
on the offensive end.

- After a 1-of-7 shooting day
Jan. 3 at Georgetown, including
missing on all ﬁve of his 3-point
attempts, Dixon searched for ad-
vice from a familiar face.

the NBA has its 7

_ “[Juan] took me in the back
gym at the Wizards’ stadium and
was telling me what I was doing
wrong-with my jump shot,” said
Jermaine Dixon last week. “I
brought that back here.”

Dixon made only 1-of-5
3-pointers in his next contest
against St. John’s, but followed
connecting on 4—of-6 in the next
two, including a'3 for 4 effort in
Pitt’s 69-63 loss at Louisville on
Saturday.

Dixon led all Pitt scorers with
19 points in that game, a week af-

Streaking Panthers travel to Syracuse

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ’ W/riter

Fresh off two convincing wins
after two disappointing losses, the
Pitt women’s basketball team looks
to get back to string three wins to-
gether for the ﬁrst time since it won
nine straight in its non-conference
schedule.

Next up for the No. 25 Panthers
(13—4, 3-2 Big East) are the Syracuse
Orange (13—5, 2-3 Big East), as the
two teams are set to face off Satur-
day at 1 p.m. at the Carrier Dome.

In the Panthers’ two recent
losses to Providence and DePaul,
junior guard Shavonte Zellous was
seemingly the only Pitt player who
could get anything going.

Besides Zellous, who is averag-
ing a gaudy 23.8 points per game
this season, the only other Panther
to score in double ﬁgures in either
of the losses was senior Xenia
Stewart, who notched 18 points
against Providence.

Not coincidentally, the Pan-
thers’ turnaround in their current
two-game  streak has been
aided by the improved play of the
supporting cast.

In the 79-47 thrashing of South
Florida last Saturday, sophomore
guard Taneisha Harrison had 13
points, while
Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson tallied
12 points.

Then, in the 76-40 win over

freshman center -

Seton Hall on Tuesday, two other

Panthers stepped up to score in ~

double ﬁgures. Junior forward
Sophronia Sallard had 12 points,
and sophomore guard Shayla Scott
contributed 10 as well.

The Panthers hope all of _ these
players remain on top of their
game, as Syracuse is a motivated
team right now, coming off its
worst loss of the season, a convinc-
ing 107-53 purnrneling at the hands
No. 1-ranked Connecticut

The Orange are led by sopho-
more guard Eﬁca Morrow at 17.7
points per game, senior guard
Chandrea Jones at 15.5 points per
game and junior forward Nicole
Michael, who scores nearly 13

points a contest.

Both Jones and Michael average
8.2 rebounds per game to tie for
the team lead in that category.

The game aside, perhaps the
biggest storyline for Syracuse is
the altercation that occurred in the
postgame handshake after the loss

to Connecticut.

Connecticut coach Geno Au— ~

riemma had a few things to say to
Michael after the game, and then
things got worse as he tripped over
her foot.

Auriemma had to be restrained
by Connecticut assistant coach and
former Pitt assistant Shea Ralph.
The Big East decided not to take
any action in the case.

Pitt ready

to Brawl

on Sunday

by Ben Duignan
Staff Writer

Last year’s first meeting be-
tween Pitt and West Virginia pro-
vided a ﬁnish that was only ﬁtting
to one of the greatest rivalries
in college sports: the Backyard
Brawl. .

The Mountaineers went up 54-
52 with nine seconds left, and Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon called a tim-
eout in the Feb. 7 matchup. Nine
seconds later, Ronald Ramon hit
one of the most memorable shots
in recent memory — a 3—pointer
that gave the Panthers the win.

The rematch a month later in
Morgantown saw a much more
one-sided affair. The Mountain-
eers won 76-60, behind 32 points
from Joe Alexander.

Ramon and Alexander have
moved on. Both teams, however,
believe they are better than they
were a year ago.

“I think [West Virginia] is
pretty similar [to a year ago],” said
Dixon. “This team will play some
switching man-to—man and some
matchup zone defense. They’ve

Chak-Talk

Adda/[ant Sparta E9[tor

  

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull en-
tered the Sun Bowl prepared for

the most important game of his

life and left El Paso after a perfor-
mance he would love to forget.
Unfortunately, it was the kind
of effort that Pitt fans will re-
member until the opening kick-
off against Youngstown State
on Sept. 5. That’s seven painful
months of nightmares. ' .
Stull and the Panthers were f -
vored to _take down Oregon State

on Dec. 31, and ride a victory to V

a preseason top-15 national rank-
ing. The carnage caused’ by that
game makes it difﬁcult to rank
Pitt in the top 15 of the state.
Stull’s ugly stat lineipfrom the
3-0 defeat: 7—of—24 passing, with
52 yards and an interception. He

was harassed all game by the Bea- _

vers’ defensive front,.which tore
through the decimated Panther
offensive line like it was caution
tape. , .
When the dust settled after
that windy Texas; day, star run-
ning back LeSean?";l\/IcCoy saddled
up the first hors __-he could ﬁnd
‘and-galloped straight to the NFL

 

Draft. President George W Bush‘

is more popular ‘right now than
Stull.

V In other words, the early peek
into Pitt’s 2009 season looks just
as rosy as Rod Blagojevich’s re-
sume. A ‘

Enraged fans are already pre-
dicting a losing season, it seems.
True, with McCoy on board,
the Panthers would have been a
trendy pick for a 10- or 11-win
season next year. On the surface,
Pitt’s chances at a Big. East title

-_ next year appear as doomed as-
one of Stull’s Sun Bowl screen’

passes.
But with‘ President Barack

And make no 
, it, Pitt's quarterbackgplay V
be muchirnproved in 2009.

Here’s a little hunch, it will. i
Pitt remains just as big a threat

to capture Big East royalty next

season. The title is up for grabs
already, with West Virginia, Rut-
gers, Cincinnati and South Flor-
ida featuring major holes. And
Pitt’s‘ defense returns nearly intact
after a dominating year.

. Ironically enough, the threat

starts with Stull. And make no
mistake about it, Pitt’s quarter-
back play will-be much improved
in 2009. '
No, Stull isn’t goirig to magi-
cally turn into Brett Favre (ac-
tually, pray that he doesn’t, let’s
say Peyton Manning), but the
upcoming senior isn’t a bad quar-

_ terback.

Stull completed 57 percent
of his passes in his ﬁrst year as a
starter and passed for 2,356 yards
with nine touchdowns and 10 in-
terceptions. Those numbers don’t
exactly force one’s jaw agape, but
Matt Cavanaugh’s offense totally
revolved around McCoy. Without
McCoy, the passing game has to
be ushered to the light.

. Pitt could have the best receiv-
ing group in the Big East, with
Jonathan Baldwin ready to break
out after a compelling freshman
campaign. Only Derek Kinder

Bostick, Sunseri not ready

to overtake Stull as passer

 

.  .  ii
Andrew Keelan / Senior Staff Photographer

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull celebrates in a gaine earlier this year. Pitt's quarterback job
has opened for the 2009 season, with Pat Bostick and Tino Sunseri challenging Stull.

Chakan, page 13

look like LenDale White.

But once again, the difference between
an 8- and a 10—win season depends on the
quarterback. No matter who it is, the pro-
duction will increase from last year.

Stull is one of the hardest workers on
the team, and no one is more upset with
the Sun Bowl’s outcome than he is. He put
a lot of blame on himself for the loss, and
he’ll come back in 2009 ready to be the
best passer possible to put that game be-
hind him. ‘

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt opened up
the quarterback spot for competition, but
Stull is the favorite. The incumbent knows
he has to improve for the Panthers to suc-
ceed.

The only way Wannstedt veers away
from Stull is if and only if a challeng-
er makes a monumental improvement.

\Whether that player is junior Pat Bostick
or freshman Tino Sunseri, Pitt will benefit
from the competition.

Sunseri looks like a future star at this
stage, but next year will be a learning effort.
And Bostick has a lot of work to do to live
up to his pre—Pitt potential.

There’s no way Warmstedt and Ca-
vanaugh enter 2009 with chaos at quarter-
back. They will do everything in their pow-
er to prepare the trio for the tribulations
of leading a good college program. After
the Sun Bowl disaster, the coaches need
to devise a new game plan of their own to
put their quarterback in the best position
to succeed.

In the end, Stull will be that guy. He has
the chance and the ability to prove the In-
ternet gurus and naysayers wrong.

Yes he can!

The junior guard seems to do some of
his better work offensively when one of
Pitt’s “Big Three” of DeJuan Blair, Sam
Young or Fields fails to put up spectacu-
lar numbers. With Young struggling to hit
shots in his three games‘ before Monday
night’s Syracuse win, Dixon averaged more
than 14 points a game while making 16 of
his 26 shot attempts.

 

It's what he does on the drive is more
what we were talking about.

J amir:
D; iiim

“He’s deﬁnitely improving and getting
better,” said Jamie Dixon. “That’s what
you want to have with guys in your pro-
gram, especially ﬁrst-year guys.”

Pitt’s coach also values tenacious de-
fense, ‘particularly from his guards, and
Jermaine Dixon has ﬁt that bill so far this

season. Although Dixon only totaled four‘

points against Syracuse in the Panthers’
78-60 triumph Monday night, he clamped
down on the Orange’s top scorer, Jonny
Flynn.

Flynn ﬁnished with 12 points, four less ,

than his season average, but went only
3-of-14 from the ﬁeld and rnisﬁred on all
ﬁve shots behind the arc. Dixon matched
up with Flynn for just about all of his 22
minutes of court time. ,

Sunday, Dixon must deal with West Vir-
ginia’s most potent shooter, senior guard
Alex Ruoff. Ruoff makes more than 37
percent of his 3-point attempts and paces
the Mountaineers in scoring at 16.5 points
per game. i if

Dixon has already become Pitt’s signa-

ture defender despite spending onlya year i
1' in the program, and the Panthers have ex-

perienced the highest_ of highs through the
ﬁrst three months of the season. The at-
mosphere of Pitt’s locker room acclimated
Dixon for his effective start, '

“Everybody welcomed me  open J

arms,” said Dixon. “Everybody has fun so

i it was easy to blend in, it’s just like "a family.

A lot of teams say that, ‘it’s a family thing,’
but eVerywhere’s not like that. There’s a

lot of selﬁsh ‘people, but it’s not like that

here.”
