Uniersity Senate approves
conﬂict of interest policy

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

Pitt faculty will soon be operating under a new
,conflict—of—interest policy which requires
professors to disclose potential conflicts between
their research and other concerns.
At its meeting yesterday the University Senate
‘Council approved the new policy, which left the
decision to implement the policy to the
administration. After the senate meeting, Pitt
President]. Dennis O’Connor confirmed that he
would approve the policy.

Most of the practices that the policy says pose‘

a potential conﬂict of interest involve faculty
members who gain financial rewards from outside
interests.

Pitt’s old policy requires that faculty members
gain prior approval from their academic
supervisors for all professional activities that
present a potential conﬂict of interest. According

to the new policy, there were problems with the
old policy. ’

“The rigor of this requirement and the lack of
university—wide procedures have been the cause
of uneven adherence and enforcement,” the
new policy stated.

The new policy only requires faculty to make
“regular timely and full confidential disclosures
to their superiors of all outside remunerative
activities related to their teaching, research or
administrative responsibilities.”

The policy outlines certain situations that
should be viewed as potential or actual conﬂicts
of interest, including:

-Accepting gratuities or special favors related
to teaching, research or administrative duties.

-Giving well—paid lectures for companies or
organizations whose economic or political
interests are affected by the investigator’s scholarly
work. '

Doctor discusses S T Ds

By Catherine Goldstein
Sta_[7“W1°iter A

The term “safe sex” is
misleading, according to
Shadyside gynecologist Dr.
Kenneth Goodrich, who spoke at
the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority
Founder's Day week kickoff last
night.

Goodrich presented an in-
depth and very descriptive slide
show on various sexually
transmitted diseases, discussing
infections, how to detect their
symptoms and how to seek
treatments if any are available.

“There are a number of myths
out there that I’m here to clarify.
There is no such thing as ‘safe
sex.’ That term is dead!” Goodrich
said. ‘

One of the myths Goodrich
referred to dealt with yeast
infections. Many times women
will mistakenly think that vaginal
discharges are the result of yeast
infections, which is wrong.

The discharge is only caused
by a yeast infection when it
resembles cottage cheese, he said.
Otherwise it may be caused by a
number of diseases, ranging from
gonorrhea to chlamydia.

Although yeast infections are
easily treated, they can become
very severe among diabetics.

Herpes are little welts that are
contagious and painful. Once
they’ve grown, they pop, dry out
and become crusty. Women can
get herpes from men, who have
the welts on their penises.

Many people think that different
types of herpes stay within a
certain area of the body, Goodrich
said, but this is also a myth.

For example, some think
Herpes 1 is confined only to the
mouth. But if someone has a cold
sore in their mouth and perform

oral sex on their partner, the
partner can contract the virus.
Herpes will go where it wants to
go, according to Goodrich.

“Gonorrhea is “on-theriseiagain, ”:
Goodrich said. Surveys in 1986
and 1987 show a huge jump in
cases ‘of gonorrhea.

Some of the symptoms of
gonorrhea include hardening and
pain in the stomach and a vaginal
discharge which is yellowish and
has a fishy odor.

Goodrich said the discharge
causes painful urination, which
can be treated with antibiotics.

The most common STD in the
last few years is chlamydia. As
with gonorrhea, a symptom of
chlamydia is a ﬁshy smelling,
yellowish discharge.

People who are at a high risk
for getting it have many sexual
partners, partners who have other
STDs and partners with
chlamydia. Chlamydia is treatable
with various antibiotics.

Goodrich said the AIDS
epidemic can possibly become
“the greatest tragedy” for African-
Americans. Although 60 percent
of AIDS'cases are among whites,
it is more prevalent among the
black community because of drug
abuse and increased sexual
activity, according to Goodrich.

It is averaged that 8 to 10
million adults have AIDS
worldwide and that 1 million
children suffer from it as well.

Condoms will help in
preventing some diseases as well
as pregnancies. But the only way
to avoid the HIV virus is ‘by
establishing a monogamous
relationship with a partner who
has tested HIV negative, and
through non-lethal sex, which
includes dry kissing or sexual
toys.

There are three stages of AIDS,

to consider ‘chancellor’
as title for O’Connor

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

Pitt President j. Dennis
O’Connor could soon be Pitt
Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor if
the Board ofTrustees approves a
motion to change O’Connor’s title
this Thursday.

O’Connor, who took over as
president on Aug. 1, said he
initiated the change.

“I think the title is not only my
preference, but I think it is more
in keeping with the long-standing
academic tradition of
universities,”_ O’Connor told the
University Senate Council at a
meeting yesterday.

The title change does not

See SID, page 5

represent any change in his job,
O’Connor said.

“The term ‘chancellor’ goes way
back in academic circles,”
O’Connor said.

“It is a title that carries with it a
lot of the rich history of the
University of Pittsburgh,” he
said.

O’Connor’s announcement was
met with approval by faculty
members at the senate meeting.

One faculty member who was
not at the meeting, chemistry
Professor Toby Chapman, began
campaigning for the title Change
to "chancellor" in in June.

Chapman then said he thought

New store
opened
 Towers

By Julie‘Sabol

News Assistant

Ice cream, candy and potato
chips, among other college
necessities, are now available for
students to purchase without
even stepping outside the
Towers. »

The__f[o_wers Express, a mini-
conveniencestore located at the
bottom of Tower B beside the
mail-room entrance, held its grand
opening yesterday.

“I am very happy. We didn’t
advertise and just word of mouth
has gotten people in "here. I’m
grateful for that,” said Robert
Eisenstat, co—owner of the
store.

Einstat said Pitt is one of the
last universities in the country to
open a dorm convenience
store. ‘

“‘We’re here as a convenience
to the students. We’re not trying
to gouge anyone; our prices are
reasonable. We hope it works
out for everyone, the university,
us and most importantly, the
students. This is for them,”
Eisenstat said. .

Though the store carries mostly
munchables, other goods,
including milk, microwaveable
food, spaghetti, school supplies
and a line of health-care products,
are also available.

The store is open from 8 a.m.
until midnight Monday through
Friday, and 10 a.m. until midnight
on the weekends.

But “thehours will expand if
the desire is there. We are very
flexible and are open to
suggestions,” Eisenstat said.

Pitts:)urghMen’s Collective explores masculinity, ‘feminism

ByLisa Tylak

Sta_ﬁ" Writer

While Bob Morgan was working as an-
instructor and counselor at Carnegie
Mellon University, he noticed a difference
between his female and male students
that made him stop and think.

“Women did not have access to power,
and men did,” he recalled. He noticed
that many women ended up feeling like
second—class citizens.‘

Morgan gathered a group of his male
friends to question the impact that they
had on the women around them. What
resulted was the Pittsburgh Men’s
Collective, a group of pro-feminist, pro-
gay rights men “looking for a new way to
live out the male role,” according to
Morgan. ' _

Morgan estimates that 700 to 800 men
have V attended the group since its

organization in 1976. The main purpose
of the group is to provide a “safe place"
for men to be themselves.

During the weekly meetings, members
have a chance to share their own
experiences and emotions concerning
the topic of the week. Though the group
is aimed at redefining the male image for
men, it is open to women as well.

“Men are suffering equally from the
patriarchy,” said Milt Wolfson, an eight-
year member of the collective. “They're
in roles that they don’t like any more
than women like submissive roles.”

According to Morgan, the group began
as a sort of therapy group to help men
come to terms with themselves and their
lives. But they soon moved away from
that approach to deal with issues that
concern the group as a whole.

Larry Gesoff started attending the
collective about a year ago because he

was frustrated by his lack of male friends.
He said the group has helped him connect
better with his emotions, get closer to
men and overcome his homophobia. He
also said that is has influenced his attitude
toward women. _ ,

“I can appreciate women more as
human beings, not as objects,” he said.

Though the group bills itself as pro-
feminist, it has been criticized for not
actively supporting the feminist
movement.

Janet Stocks, a teaching fellow in the
sociology department at Pitt, has attended
meetings of the collective, and she
questions the group’s non-activism.

“I think they need to examine the fact
that they’re calling themselves feminists.
I think they’re doing some really
interesting things. I just don’t think they’re
doing enough,” she said.

Morgan admitted that the group is not

as active as he expected it would be
when it started, but he also said that the
group is helping the women's movement
in its own way.

“It seems a lot more important to me to
help men deal with their masculine roles,”
he said. A

Gesoff explained that activism is not
what brings men to the group.

“Men coming to the collective are.
trying to change themselves,” he "said.
According to Gesoff, each man goes
through his own “evolution” while
attending the group.

He said thatsince the group can consist

of 25 to 50 different members at any
given time, some of the members may

not have reached a stage where they are *~

comfortable with group activism.

“If someone becomes a feminist, that’s
going to change their actions in their
everyday life.”

Pitt medical ethics center advises local hospitals

13y Michael J. Lowe
Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt's Center for Medical Ethics
began consultation recently at

local hospitals, where medical

personnel can consult with an
ethics committee when they have
questions about a patient’s

' treatment.

Health—care professionals at
Presbyterian University Hospital
and Montefiore Hospital consult
the center about five to 10 times
a month, said center director Alan
Meisel.

The ethics committee is most
frequently asked whether a
patient should be taken off life-
support systems, according to
Joel Frader, the center’s associate
director for consultation.

“Sometimes it is evident that
patients have a right to self-
determination, even if the doctors
and nurses don’t like it,” Frader
said.

Frader stressed that the
committee was formed to give

advice about the goals of.

treatment and not the type of
treatment a patient should
receive. _

The center has a staff of six
people that are trained to head
the consultations, Meisel said. It
began official operation in 1986
with four main areas: clinical
consultation, research, education
and continuing education.

“I think we are the strongest
place in the country doing
empirical research,” Meisel said.

Before the center officially
opened, groups of researchers,
including Meisel and Charles W.
Lidz, associate director for
research administration,
conducted studies about the kinds
of information doctors gave
patients, whether patients
understood the information and
how decisions about their
treatment were being
made.

“With the creation of the center
we were able to hire a research
director,” Meisel said.

Laura Siminoff, director of
research projects, is conducting a

the recruitment of patients to

trials.

Her other study involves the
policies for organ and tissue
donations, according to Meisel.

The center is also working on
five more studies that have not

been fully developed, such as the '

quality of care to patients with
AIDS, and doctor—patient
communication regarding
advance directives.

The third area that the center
stresses is education.

Students enrolled in the School
of Medicine are taught medical
ethics in each year of their medical
training.

The most important part of the
education program is the Clinical
Ethics Training Program. It was
established in 1987 with a three-
year grant from the Vira I. Heinz
Endowment.

Meisel said, “It’s been a
tremendous success in improving
education in medical ethics at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

The program integrates clinical
training in medical ethics into the
curriculum of the third— and
fourth—year medical student.

philosophy of science, with help
from the Medical Ethics Center,
has also created a master's
degree program in medical
ethics.

“It is a small program, but we
are confident that it is improving
all of the time,” Meisel said.

The program is in its third year
and has graduated one student
thus far.

The fourth area that the center
stresses is continuing education.

“We decided that traditional
continuing education in medical
ethics left much to be desired,”
Meisel said.

The Center for Medical Ethics,
along with the Hospital Council
of Western Pennsylvania, initiated
in September 1990 a Consortium
Ethics Program to help in the
continuing education in medical
ethics.

The program takes two people
from each of a dozen hospitals in
the surrounding area and trains
them over a three-year period to
be primary-care medical ethicists
in their hospitals, according to
Meisel.

These people will then
implement their own medical
ethics plans in their own
hospitals.

Art exhibit
shows role

of women
in ’20s ads

By Jen Spagnuolo
For The Pitt News

What do Cindy Crawford,
Paulina Porizkova and
Claudia Schiffer all have in
common? T hey’re used by

manufacturers to sell
products.
Throughout history

women have been used to
promote clothing designers
and appeal to the public in
advertisements.

The current Pitt Program
Council art exhibit in the
student union’s Conney
Kimbo gallery displays such
ads from the first half of the
century. .

“Women in Fashion” is a
collection of international
poster reproductions of
women advertising items
from cars to perfu'me. The
exhibit covers the years
1920 to 1930.

The posters, which will
be on display until Jan. 23,
are part of a traveling exhibit
that Pitt has ‘leased from the
French Cultural Service of
New York City. The posters
come from the Musee de la
Publicite. ~

Pitt Program Council art
director Julie Veil said, “I
am surprised by the success
of this exhibit because it is
not what I thought it would
be.”

She said she expected
only examples of women’s
fashion throughout the
century, and the exhibit is
made up of advertisements
instead.

The prints depict how
women’s appearances have
changed with the turn of
the century. The style of
hair was short and
contoured, as in the poster
entitled “Mistinguett.” This
print, dated 1925, focuses
on a woman ,with short
blond hair and large feathers
and jewels surrounding her
face. A

In the '20s women went
from long dresses that
covered them from neck to
ankle to tube—shaped
dresses that revealed
shoulders and ankles, as
well as the ﬂattened chest
and long pearls displayed
by the “Vera Mint” liqueur
ad.

Coty cosmetics has an ad
which is I a hazy
representation of a woman’s
face. Her red lips stand out
— an example of the
budding public sensuality
of women.

The poster is simple and
has no direct reference to
fashion.

Veil said most people like
the collection and some
have even asked where they
can purchase the prints.

approaching cultural and
political questions with a
global or international
awareness. It is a journal of
culture.”

The journal was started
in the early 1970s by
William Spanos, an
internationalscholarwhose
goal was to get away from
the modernist pattern of
the international High
Style.

“lboundary 2] had its
origin in the sense of
crossing over, of crossing a
border into the unknown,
or entering into a period
which was not really a

period but which was.

precipitated by theaend of
Modernism,” Spanos
said. '

A current project of the
members on the journal’s
staff is to translate some of
the great literary works of
foreign authors into English
including the works of
Shosa, a South African
woman poet.

Scholars of English,
American or foreign
literature write for the
journal. .

But works by historians,
philosophers and social
scientists are also
published.

Sixty percent of the

_ works published are

solicited by international
scholars, and 40 percent
are from unsolicited
submissions.

Although b0undary2 is
an international journal,
students are welcome to
submit their work. About
25 percent of all
submissions are from
graduate students and 5
percent are ‘from
undergraduates. Every
week 10 to 15 essays are
submitted. A

“Our major concern is
what the future role of
American intellectuals
studying culture and
politics around the world
is, what the future role of
literature is,” Bove said.

Upcoming themes
include Eastern Europe,
Latin American post-
modernism, the Pacific
Rim and South African
literature.

according to Goodrich:
-Stage one is asymptomatic,
where the patient tests HIV
positive and there are no
problems aside from an acute
flu-like illness that goes away
quickly. ‘
-In stage two the patient suffers
from AIDS-related Complex.
There is persistent swelling of
the lymph glands, skin rashes,
night sweats, etc.
0 Stage three is AIDS, where the
patient suffers from a
total immune-system break
down.

Many who saw Goodrich’s

presentation were shocked at
some of the findings as well as
happy to have been
informed.

University of Pittsburgh senior
Lindsey Maxwell said, ‘‘It’s
important for the black
community to be educated,
especially here at Pitt, where
sexual promiscuity runs
rampant.”

But Pitt junior Tina Watson was
disappointed that “more men of
all colors weren’t there because
men feel they are safe if they just
use a condom and that’s not true.
There’s no such thing as safe
sex.”

How Pitt Program Council plans a terrn’s activities

By Scott Nespor
For T be Pitt News

_ Tip O’Neill, Maya Angelou, Steven
Wright, William F. Buckley Jr. — what
does it take to book big-name personalities
to speakat Pitt?

According to Joanne Fiamma, director
of the Pitt Program Council’s lectures
committee, the PPC is often contacted by
celebrities’ agents.

Other times the group quickly
brainstorms for 10 people it thinks students
would be interested in and then tries to
book the most visible one.

Fiamma said some speakers can cost up
to $50,000, which is out of Pitt’s budget,

but the PPC can book excellent speakers
for $10,000 to $20,000 and sometimes
even a fraction of that cost.

Once the fee is established, the next
step is negotiating and writing a contract.
Pitt provides, transportation, :1 room and
reimbursement for food costs.

PPC events scheduled for this semester
are a lecture by former Speaker of the

House Tip O'Neill on March 16, trips to 1

Washington, D.C., and Panama City, Fla.,
all-night bowling, a performance by artist
Jennifer Lewis, a student art show and
Meltdown '92, which is a winter
carnival taking place at the end of
January. 4

Gagliardi stressed that PPC’s members

do not have a “secret agenda” nor do they
plan “programs for the committee
members.” '

She said the PPC is not a success if no
one goes to the programs. Therefore, it
“plans whatever will bring in a lot of
people.”

The committee meetings are open to all
students, and the meetings are announced
in The Pitt News.

Most PPC decisions aren't made quickly.
Arts committee directorjulie Veil and the
arts committee spent two weeks
debating the theme for the Student Art
Show.

“We have to ask ourselves, ‘Will people
like it?”’ Veil said.

Deciding this is a group process. But the
group realizes that “you can't make
everyone happy. There are too
many people on this campus,” Veil
said.

Special events director Todd Cable and
his committee planned Meltdown ’92, a
week-long winter carnival at the end of
January.

The carnival features a performance by
comedian Jimmy Krenn, ice skating, at
student talent show and the Arctic
Adventure, which is a keg roll.

To attract students the program has to
be “pretty big or no one will come to it.
They would rather go to some bar,” Cable
said. ‘

Condoms on campus

Among its other academic pursuits, the University of
Pittsburgh should follow suit with other campuses across
the country and better facilitate the needs of its students
outside the classroom. _ _

_As frank and honest discussion about the hazards of
unprotected sex has thankfully become more visible, the
one important fact that has come out of these discussions
is that sex without a condom can be risky as well as life-

 . threatening.
 But despite the statistics and stories that show the
I dangers of unsafe sex, many people continue to engage
in it, either out of irresponsibility, inconvenience or
embarrassment.

At Pitt, administrators could take a great step towards

l

 

lessening the likelihood of unsafe sex among students by ‘

“better facilitating the purchasing of contraception on
campus. ' .

The Student Health Service offers a reasonable programs
to provide sexually active males and females with-
contraception; however, for the student who does not
plan ahead, the accessibility of condoms can result in
unsafe intercourse. .

But students should be aware that while using condoms
significantly decreases a person’s chance of contracting a
sexually transmitted disease, condoms are not 100-percent
effective in either preventing pregnancy or STDs.

The university should install condom machines on
campus, as well as provide dental dams (squares of latex
that reduce the chance of passing the HIV virus while
performing oral sex on a woman). H

In dormitories, the reasons are obvious. In fraternity
houses, the logic is sound as well. But Pitt should not stop
there. r ’

The university should install condom machines in
various restrooms on campus as well. Pitt could, by its
actions, make 'tself the safe-sex university of western
Pennsylvania.

Other universities, such as George Washington
University,’ have placed condom dispensers in public
campus areas without compromising anyone’s rights and

, together. .

No doubt that there will be people that will argue that
a state—related university is spending tax dollars “to
promote promiscuity.”

- But if the university truly wants to be as “cutting edge”
as it claims to be, it must provide added resources for the
sexual safety of its students.

With a mature and realistic analysis of the situation, it is
brazenly clear that with the rising number of people
infected with sexually transmitted diseases, condoms are
as important in ensuring a student’s future as the education
he or she is receiving.

See War, page 9

Anise ’s statements are sexist

I write to protest an
unnecessary, gratuitous and sexist
comment in Uan. 13l’s lead article
on Rollo Turner's suspension from
the black studies department. To
provide some background to
Turner’s suspension, the article
quotes Emmanuel Anise, a
professor in the department, on
an ongoing conﬂict between
Brenda Berrian, the departrnent’s
current chair, and a former (male)
chair of the department. I have
no personal knowledge of the
circumstances, and since Berrian
and FAS Dean Peter Koehler each
refuse to comment, I certainly
can't defend their decision to
suspend Turner.

Nonetheless, regardless of how
justified Turner's position is, I
find outrageous Anise’s comment
that a black woman who suspends
a black man “endangers” the black
community — or at least black
men. For those who didn't see it
the first time, Anise is quoted as
saying, “The black man inAmerica
is an endangered species — he's
endangered by his own black
woman."

Letters

Black men often expect and

rely upon black women to soothe '

their (often quite justified) outrage
and humiliation at being
oppressed by the larger,
predominantly white society.
Unfortunately, they also often add
to black women’s oppression of
being black an additional penalty
for being women in a sexist
society. It is frequently considered
an act against the black
community (or at least against
black men) for black women to
publicize the particulars of their
suffering, both from society at
large and from black men in
particular.

In this instance, Anise appears
to believe that in no case
whatsoever may a black woman
suspend an employee if the
employee is a black man — to do
so makes “the black man in
America an endangered species.”
The patriarchal and chauvinist
contempt Anise expresses with

“his own black woman” is both
stunning and all too common.
Anise suggests that black women

and their interests, both as

individuals and as a group, must
always be subordinate to black
men and their interests — even
when it is a woman who is
responsible for supervising the
work of a man.

Anise’s comment introduces a
conﬂict between black women
and black men where there need
be none, rather than recognizing
that a shared oppression is best
defeated by working together.
Attacking black women solves
neither the problems of black
men nor of the black community
as a whole. Views such as Anise’s,
even when born of frustration at
black men's oppression before
society as a whole, ultimately
work against the efforts of all
who seek an end to both sexism
and racism.

Taisq

Years" ago the mere mention of the
word “divorce” made people cringe or
draw conclusions about your moral
character. My grandmother once told
me that thoughts of divorce were
unheard of in her time. Once you got
married, that was it. You stayed married
until death.

Although she admits that there were
some difficult times with major

. sacriﬁces, she insists that she wouldn’t
trade it for the world. She told me: “I
sometimes had it hard with your
grandfather, but we’ve been together
for more, than 45 years . . these
younger generations don’t understand
what true commitment is all about.
Their whole idea] of marriage is sex,
money and a little’ love.”

It is estimated that 50 percent of the
people married this year will divorce or
separate between the first and fifth
year of marriage. '

Of marriages begun in the early
1940s (1946 is the year my grandmother
married), about one in four ended in
divorce. That's pretty good in

- comparison to marriages today. I've
often dreaded the thought of marriage.
My parents have recently divorced,
and it’s tough emotionally to deal with
—— not so "much because I’m losing a
parent but because my parents’ are
losing each other. After 23 years of
marriage, I fear that no one can take

each other. Even after seeing them
treat each other so badly, I know deep
down that they wouldn’t deliberately
or intentionally hurt each other. The
hurt, the pain and the memories of
their marriage is what I carry with me
each day. It is that hurt that I fear most.
I fear the release of that pain which, in
most cases, is released on the one that
is closest to you. -
My fear is that I'll behave the sam

way my parents have — as many
people do — without even realizing

The trauma of a divorce can

care of my parents like they would‘

that I'm doing so.
Marriage is a complex institution that

must be approached seriously with the ‘

intent to work at maintaining an
emotional balance. It can only be
achieved through communication and
compromise.’ If one is not willing to do
either, then the likelihood of the
marriage being not just successful but
happy and fulﬁlling is unforeseeable.
Many people get married for a lot of

selective reasons: love, sex, money, ;

class and so forth.

What has happened to traditional
values, «those similar to my
grandmother’s —— such as sex after
marriage or life—long commitment to
their parent? To think that a person can
marry eight times (as did Elizabeth
Taylor and Mickey Rooney) has to have
some effect on the conscious of
American people. _

' What kind of society have we become
when getting married eight times is not
held as abominable? Instead it becomes
the praise of glamour and newsworthy
publicity. Sadly enough, marriage has
changed. Unfortunately, a high number
of married couples will ﬁnd themselves
either separated or divorced (during

‘ the first ﬁve years of marriage). Marriage

is still the most sought after union
between two people, and yet it is
becoming the most unsuccessful bond
that two people can share (for whatever
reason). My hopes and wishes are that
when I. marry, I will be more successful

Divorce is on the rise, no doubt, but is
it because people just don’t understand
each other or because we are prone to
divorce after watching our parents and
other couples divorce?

According to an article in last week’s
Newsweek, “Breaking the Divorce Cycle,”
children of divorce are more likely to
divorce because their parent’s breakup
leaves them with traumatic aftereffects.
The emotional wounds affect their
relationships, and they deal with them like
their parents: by divorcing. I disagree with
the notion that most children of divorce
are more prone to divorce than children
whose parents have not divorced. Yes,
their parents’ example of marriage is- a

broken one, but I don’t think that means ’

they will end up in a bad marriage. Instead
it would make them more idealistic by
realizing the problems they want to avoid
in a partner. ‘

For example, in the article one adult
child of divorce said, “I had certain ideals
for my husband, and I found them injohn

- [her husband]. It wasn’t my parents’

marriage.”

In the article this woman was shown as
an exception to the‘ average child of
divorce. I don’t think she’s the exception
because of my own experience with
children of divorce. Children of divorce
become more idealistic when looking for
a partner — not more prone to broken
relationships. 0‘

I see some of my own friends romanticize
their relationships. Because love is
supposed to be wonderful, they avoid
ﬁghting at almost all costs. They go around
smiling all the time saying how wonderful
life is when it’s just a facade. Part of a good
relationship _is working out your
differences. It seems to me that if there
were never any differences, then the
relationship must be pretty shallow.

Even the Brady Bunchiparents had
arguments. Now that my romanticizing
friends are thinking of marriage, I’m starting
to get worried. I see them romanticize
narriage, too, and I don’twant to see them

get divorced. In reality, love doesn't
conquer all, and marriage isn’t something
that makes love either more real or more

permanent. Realizing this fact could stop A 
some divorces from happening by‘ 

encouraging practical thinking about
marriage. .

The problemsbefore marriage will still
be there once you get married. If you can’:

deal with it, then avoid it. I'm not saying to 7 in:

look for a perfect person or to just not

bother getting married at all. I'm saying -

that when you start to think about marriage,
remember the part of the vows that says,
“till death do us part.” Can you live with
this person for the rest of your life? Can you
work through your differences, or do you

overlook them? Marriage won’t solve the -

differences, so if you can’t'deal with them
‘now, you won’t be able to deal with them
later. . 3 i
I don’t think a parental divorce is why
people divorce today. The problem exists

before marriage. We all want to ‘be loved, '

so when we find someone who loves us

we want to try to establish it through

marriage. . _ A
"One of my friends told me that we grow

up believing we marry the person we love, I

but the person we love" may not be the
right person for us to marry.

Most of us have too many insecurities to t" " I

take the risk of ﬁnding someone whom we
love and who is more suitable to marry. I
think since people are divorcing left and
right that we are developing a perspective

thatmarriage is temporary: Go with ituntil ’  ~

it doesn't work. When your car runs’ but of

gas, you don’t abandon it. You fill it up I

with more gas. When there are problems
in a marriage, you have to work through
them to keep the marriage going. You
don’t just dump it. t - .

In some cases, if there are major problems
with the marriage, then I think it might
have been avoided. Know who you are
marrying before you get married. If you
think practically about the relationship
before you get married, then you'll know

what you’re getting into — or if you should

get into it. "t

explore otherwise hidden events
and motives? The media, whether
it be television, magazine or
newspaper, is the watchdog for
it’s citizens. If the government

' cannot balance itself because of

fraternal bonds, the responsibility
rests squarely upon the shoulders
of the free press. A free press is
the bedrock of democracy, for an
uninformed public is an easily
manipulated group indeed. “Our
liberty depends on the freedom
of the press," Thomas Jefferson
said, “and cannot be limited
without being lost."

The Persian Gulf crisis placed
the media in a precarious position:
It could allow itself to be spoonfed
the processed information of
official sources and televise
entertaining ﬁreworks from the
front, or the press could bravely
decline the government’s
invitation to complacency and
challenge (or at least verify) the

ofﬁcial versions.

The government’s stance
toward the press is well-
documented. Standard rules were
broken when Bush undertook
Operation Just Cause. Reporters
were left behind, and the quick
military strike‘ went largely
uncovered. Of course strange and
persistent rumors have circulated
concerning‘ that skirmish ever
since, but nothing was
documented by timely pictures
and stories. The Bush
Administration managed the
Persian Gulf crisis just as
effectively.

Recalling the lessons from
Vietnam, where reporters roamed
unchecked and discovered quite
a few newsworthy stories, Bush
ordered the reporters to be pooled
together, told them where they
could wander, who they could
talk to and had their stories
checked ’ for “sensitive”
information. Even an interview

an attentive ofﬁcer. What we saw
were the military brieﬁngs with
exact ﬁgures and optimistic news.
Americans watched their
televisions for the exciting
destruction of an Iraqi building
that supposedly harbored
weapons and supplies.

The government, I suppose,
should be expected to attempt
such maneuvers. What wasn’t
expected was the media’s
censorship of itself. The sizable
media establishment allowed
itself to be pressured by the

99

government into not challenging
the sterilized reports issued each
day.

Where were the pictures NBC
reportedly had that showed
gruesome photographs of civilian
women and children lying dead
after one of our surgical strikes?
The press did not hesitate to
show us pictures of Kurds gassed
by Hussein. I -saw women and
children, holding hands, dead in
the street. I read accounts of Iraqi
soldiers stealing the incubators
from tiny children. I heard terrible

stories about Hussein's attempt I

to brutally eradicate the fleeing
Kurds after the war. Where were
the stories and pictures of the
estimated 200,000 Iraqi civilians
who died as a result of our
merciless bombings? If the job of

’ the media is to only sell

newspapers or to attract viewers,
then perhaps the news from the
war front reflected the wishes of
the American people. But if its
duty is to correct the distorted

paintings of the government, to -

balance its power, the press failed
miserably.

No war is surgical. And for the 0

press to further the idea that this
conflict was somehow cleaner
than others contradicts its basic
duty. For it is not enough to cater
to the nation’s whims, as Newton

Why don’t people like the Pitt
cheerleaders? As I think about
this question, it brings back
memories of when I was in high’
school. I was not a cheerleader,
butl was a band member, which

Dere

could be just as bad depending
on who you talk to. Band
members in my high school, like
many, many schools, are
occasionally looked down upon.
(I’ll bet this comes as a big surprise
to you former band members.)
The point is that, as a dedicated
member of a quality organization,
I occasionally took exception to
this sort of treatment. I took pride
in what I did, knowing that the
compensations were not those of
a material sort.

We did not get paid, but our
performances gave, us something
worth more than money:
satisfaction.

It is in this way that I can say
the Pitt cheerleaders are unfairly
maligned.

Pitt cheerleaders have plenty to celebrate — a national championship is their latest success.

It is all too easy to feel contempt
for things you know little about.
As a first—year student, I often
said the same things that I hear
now about the cheerleaders,
because I was ignorant.

I blindly assumed that it actually

Panthers face Connecticut tonight

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers take their

undefeated Big East record on

the road tonight to face
Connecticut at the Hartford Civic
Center. '

The Huskies are 2-1 in
conference play, having lost to
Villanova Saturday night. It was
the first loss on the season‘for
head coach Jim Calhoun’s team,
which leaves the Huskies with an
overall record of 11—1. They have
beaten Miami and St. John’s in
Big East play.

The first word that describes
Connecticut is defense.
Opponents hit just 59 percent of
their shots from the field and are
also outrebounded by an average
of six a game. Even though
Calhoun likes an active, pressing
defense, his team has committed
60 less fouls than its opposition.

The starting five have remained
constant for Connecticut in all 12
games this season. Senior guard
Chris Smith is the leader of the
club. Smith, a two-year starter at
shooting guard, now mans the
point for Calhoun but is still a
shoot-first, pass—second type of
player. He leads the Huskies in
scoring, averaging 22 points a
contest. Smith has been especially
hot of late; in the last six games
he has scored over 20 points, and
twice he topped the 50-point
mark. While he is not a
tremendous percentage shooter,
he makes big shots and is
automatic from the foul line.

Another familiar face to Pitt
fans is Scott Burrell, who is playing
his third position in as many
years. Because of the presence of
first-year player Donyell Marshall,

Hovan gains 100th
win; wrestlers split
in meet at Clemson

By Rob Pugliese

Sta ff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team began its dual—match season Saturday
with mixed results. In the opening match the Panthers fell to
Clemson 25~14, but they rebounded for a 24-20 victory over the
University of Tennessee—Chattanooga to even their record at 1-
1 on the young campaign. The Panthers entered the weekend
ranked 14th in the National Wrestling Coaches Association
tournament poll and 20th in the NWCA dual—meet ratings.
According to head coach Rande Stottlemyer, the Panthers
started very sluggishly.

“I wasn’t very pleased; that’s an understatement,” Stottlemyer
said. “But we showed a little bit more character in coming back
and wrestling better against UTC. Right now we’re not wrestling
with a lot of pride and enthusiasm, and that’s gotta change.
That’s what we’ll emphasize this week.”

Although Stottlemyer said that few individuals wrestled
solidly in both matches, one of two returning Panther All-

Americans made history. At 158 pounds, redshirt senior Scott _

Hovan recorded a technical fall against Clemson for his 100th
career victory at Pitt. Hovan is only the second wrestler in Pitt
history to achieve 100 victories, following two—tjme national
champion and four-time All-American Pat Santoro. Last season
Hovan compiled a 31-5 mark en route to garnering Eastern
Wrestling League and All-American\ honors. With his goals set
higher than ever, Hovan didn’t place too much emphasis on this
accomplishment. I _

“It really doesn’t mean ,a whole lot,” Hovan said. “It’s a nice
milestone in your career and I'm glad I accomplished it, but
that’s not why I’m wrestling.”

Other victories against the Tigers came from 167-pounder
Sean Gibbs and All-American heavyweight Perry Miller. Gibbs
recorded a 3~2 decision, while Miller won by forfeit. In addition,
Miller was named the EWL Wrestler of the Week for his
performance at the 59th Wilkes Open Championship. Miller
coasted to the heavyweight title at this tournament while also
winning the award for most falls in the least amount of time. He
posted three falls in only 7: 14 and won the title with a 7-2 victory
over another Panther, first—year grappler Pat Wiltanger, who will
be redshirting this season. -

Against UTC, first—year blue-chipper John Richey recorded a

pin to get the Panthers started at 126 pounds. Richey bounced

unwavering dedication. It’s not
everyone who can stand out there
time and again, exhorting cheers.
Sure, any clod can get up there
once and get a few laughs.

But it’s not that easy. And to say
that it is is an insult to the people
who go to practice, who sacrifice
their time and energy.

It’s just like when I was in the
band. Somebody would make
some smart remark about my
allegiance, and I’d feel like yelling
back, “What the hell do you know
about it?” I’m sure the cheerleaders
feel this way sometimes. It comes
with the separation that hard work
brings.

Because of the unknown and
unseen nature of practices and
the like, it is easy to assume that
the cheerleaders don’t do all that
much. That assumption is dead
wrong.

And because they are a group
which, by nature, is so close—knit,
the inference can be made that
they are stuck-up.

I don’t know any cheerleaders
socially, but those I’ve talked to
at sporting events display only
the blunt, honest pride and
devotion that should be in their
persona. ‘

Yet they continue to be seen as
the cause of student apathy at
athletic events.

Talk to the cheerleaders (the
ones I have spoken to are quite
willing), and they will tell you the
amount of work they do. It’s
pretty staggering, considering
they don’t receive payment for it.
I really can't identify with them
because I get paid for the work I
do here. _

The dedication they must have
is amazing, and it screams for our
respect.

The point of all this is that
when it’s painfully obvious (even
to a journalist) that a group of
people exude incredible amounts
of dedication and effort, the group

Continued from page 10

Rudy gained wins in the 50-
and 100-yard freestyle and
anchored Penn State’s 200-yard
medley relay to victory in the
meet’s ﬁrst event.

As for the performance of the
nationally ranked Lions, Pitt head
coach David Belowich was
impressed at their bottomless well
of talent. “They are just amazingly
deep,” Belowich said. “They carry
24-25 swimmers on their roster.”

Belowich said that while PSU
didn’t have one dominant
swimmer, he was struck by the
Nittany Lions’ penchant for team
balance. “As far as any individual
[swimmer], no one really stood
out,” Belowich said. “They didn’t
have any outrageous individual
times. They just had no
weaknesses.”

Evidence of this lack of
weakness was that Penn State
took first place in 12 of 16 events,
with 10 different swimmers
contributing in those wins. As for
the Panthers’ showing, Belowich
was disappointed at his team’s
erratic effort. “I didn’t think we
raced as well as we could,”
Belowich said. “There were some
who gave a good effort and some
who didn’t.”

Those who gave commendable
effort include Julie Rocks (second
in 200 ﬂy), Donna Flatch (first in
1—meter diving, second in 3-meter)
and ‘Laura—Lee Sullivan (first in

100 breast stroke). First-year
swimmer Christy Knobloch
continued to impress, taking first
place in the 200—yard backstroke
and participating in Pitt’s 400-
yard free-relay victory, along with
Jen Burns, Vicky Geubtner and
Keri Killinger.

Belowich noted two swimmers
in particular who, despite not

winning their events, performed‘

admirably: senior tri—captain
Janine Atiyeh and first—year athlete
Laura Zdyb. While Atiyeh placed
second in the 200 backstroke, it
was how she raced that impressed
Belowich. “I was pleased with
how she came from behind,”
Belowich said. “She showed what
type of condition the team is in.”

As for Zdyb, who missed the
first half of the season due to
mono, her return to action was a
welcome sight to the ‘Panther
head coach in light of the
departure of Pitt’s top distance
swimmer, Jill Comeau.

“We’re looking forward to
Laura’s contributions in the
distance events,” Belowich said,
noting it will take a while for
Zdyb to regain her edge. “Once
again, because this was her first
meet, she wasn’t in top racing
form. But overall I think she did
a pretty nice job.”

The lack of Competition over
the break had an effect on the
team as well as the outcome of
the meet. While Penn State
benefitted from swimming a dual
meet the previous weekend
against Minnesota, the Panthers
hadn’t seen serious competition
since the Pitt Invitational in early
December.
that the lack of a competitive-
racing atmosphere for a long
period of time (a month) was
evident in his team’s sluggish
performance. “Penn State had a
slight advantage in that their meet

Belowich admitted ‘

with Minnesota reacclimated
them with competition racing,”
Belowich said. “We were sluggish
with racing again. We got off the
blocks slower, coasted in on some
finishes and had awkward
exchanges on our relay events.”

In addition to the holiday layoff,
Pitt was at a disadvantage due to
injuries to senior Crit Gallagher
(rotator cuff/ tendinitis) and junior
Clare McShane (strep throat). Both
missed Saturday’s meet.

week. Her status for this weekend
is unknown. McShane is currently’,
on antibiotics and should return
soon. While Belowich didn’t get
the effort he expected over the
weekend, he said he's not too
worried about it. “I was hoping to
get back to our December
performance level; that didn’t
happen,” Belowich said. “In the
coming weeks, we’ll get there.”

Pitt’s next meet is a combined
men's and women’s dual meet
this Friday against West Virginia
at Trees Pool.

Wrestlers

Continued from page 10
back from a 7-5 loss-_ against

is ' Clemson, and Stottlemyer said he

was pleased with Riche_y’s
performance on his first timeout.
However Richey said that the
adjustment from high-school to
collegiate competition was
difficult. A

“I just need to prepare better,”
Richey said. “I have to adjust; it’s
different wrestling kids all over
the country who are as good or
better than me.”

Steve Budman recorded a
superior decision at 142 pounds,
while Miller pinned his opponent.
Other victories came from Gibbs
at 167 pounds and sophomore

Jeff Kloiber at 190 pounds. Hovan
suffered a rare defeat against the
Moccasins, and even more rare
was the fact that he was pinned.
“That doesn't happen very
often; it’s pretty rare,” Stottlemyer
said. “It’s just one of those things
that happens, but he wrestled a
helluva match against Clemson.”
“It’s the first time I’ve been
pinned in college,” Hovan said.
Assistant coach Jim Beichner
said that some of the squad’s
troubles could be attributed to
the prominence of several new
faces in the lineup.
“We’re a little bit young; we
have a mix of old and new,”
Beichner said. “It was our first

dual meet of the year, and the
teams we wrestled have had more
experience. We weren’t real crisp,
but we might be able to chalk
that up to being our first time out.
And the second match was
deﬁnitely a step up."

Pitt will open its Eastern
Wrestling League season on
Friday evening, when the Lock
Haven Bald Eagles come to
Fitzgerald Field House. Beichner
said Pitt will look to its solid
nucleus of Miller, Hovan, Gibbs
and Budman to carry a great deal
of the load.

Another key man will be
Kloiber, who showed promise in
a 14-11 first—year campaign.

playing, it tends to throw a
wrench in the gears. It’s almost
uncanny. Basketball may not be
much different. It’s hard to defend
against shots that normally
shouldn’t be taken or rebound
against badly thrown shots, just
to list a couple of examples of
~ why it’s not as easy as you think
to play against a bad team. Also
Pitt was just coming offa big win
against Syracuse and may not
have had the proper attitude to

play a game most people would
look past.So next time you
complain about the Panthers
playing to the level of their
competition —— playing badly
against bad teams, remember that
the Panthers may play badly at
times, but they are a young team.
Mistakes will be made.

If the Panthers lose, then they
played badly because they didn’t
play well enough to win — no
matter who they played or how
they played.
