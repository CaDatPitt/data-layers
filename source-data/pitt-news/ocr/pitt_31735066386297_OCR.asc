After two weeks of frantic
campaigning the 20 homecoming
candidates were cut to 10 when
the Pitt Program Council
announced the homecoming
court yesterday.

The candidates who made the
court are Alexis Archer, Jill Betz,
Andrew Brenner, John Demming,
Michael Duckworth, Franz
Jobson, Anita Rodriguez, George
Samuelson, Lisa Tate and Marcia
Walters.

Jobson, a junior whose
campaign is endorsed by the
Black Action Society, said that
running for homecoming king is
a worthwhile experience.

“Well, I ran for homecoming
when Alexis [Archer], who is also
sponsored by the Black Action
Society, asked me if I wanted to
be her running mate. I thought,
‘Yeah, sure.’ It was a great idea,”
said jobson.

“I’m basically a shy guy, so
campaigning has helped me to
come out of my shell,” he said.

Jobson said there is one aspect
of homecoming, however, that

The increase in the price of
oil will not greatly affect the
University of Pittsburgh, said
Thomas Hussey, associate vice
president for management
services.

“[The increase in oil prices]
does have a ripple effect in the
economy, but it does not have
a direct effect from the
escalation in oil prices. We will
be effected, but not as hard as
we would be if we relied mostly
on oil-based energy," Hussey
said.

He added that most of the
energy used by the university is
generated from coal and natural
gas. ,_
Glenn Schott, manager of
energy conservation and
resources, lists steam, electricity
and surge water as the major
energy sources used by the
university. Each of these sources

Pitt unaﬂected by /aiglaer oil prices

are generated from natural gas
and coal, he said.

The university has been
working to conserve energy,
Schott said.

“We’re doing_ several things
to conserve energy. We’re
working on several projects
totaling $2 million in capital
costs to save us up to $7,000 a
year in utility costs," said Schott.

Schott said that lighting was a
big area in energy consumption.

“Lighting costs the university
$7 million a year," Schott said.
Pitt has improved lighting in
streets and in renovated areas
on campus, Schott said. Schott
also said that all persons can
help to conserve energy.

“We encourage people to do
simple things  to use desk
lamps, to turn off the lights
when they leave their offices or
their dorms. They seem like
simple things, but they all add
up.”

According to John Verana,

assistant vice president for
administration and director of
central business, the university
is working on a project to reduce
the number of vehicles and
find more efficient ways to use
them in an effort to conserve oil
and gasoline.

“We are buying gasoline at
discounted rates [and] trying to
extend that as best we can,”
Verana said. He added
consolidating runs and driving
less to the list of methods in
which the university has
engaged. .

According to Verana, the
university began a study of its
gasoline consumption about
four months ago.

“We, like anyone else, are
aware of the fact that at this
time there are rising gasoline
prices. People have budgets in
which they live. You have to
look for ways in which you can
cut costs and not increase your
expenditures,” Verana said.

“The only negative thing I've
found was the posters which have
been torn down or had tacks
sticking in the eyes of some of the
candidates, but I guess you kind
of expect that,” said Jobson.

Betz said she couldn’t believe
it when she received a phone call
from the Pitt Program Council
Wednesday night.

“[The PPCl told us that they
were going to call us when they

had the results, so when I got the_.

call, I was shocked,” said Betz, a
junior and member of Delta Zeta
sorority. “It was a real honor.”

Like Jobson, Betz said
campaigning was not one of the
better points of homecoming.

“I don't know; I just felt funny
about passing out flyers that were
asking people to vote for me.
Although I got a chance to meet
a lot of nice people, I did not
want to promote myself,” she
said.

Samuelson, a junior who is
sponsored by his fraternity, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, said, “It’s great to
be a court candidate. I was at the
Pirate game when [they called],”
Samuelson said.

Samuelson said since there
weren’t that many male
candidates running for
homecoming king, he felt
confident about the court
decision.

“Well, there are only seven
guys running, and out of those
seven, five are chosen for court,
so I figured that I had a pretty
good chance,” he said.

Candidates who did not make
homecoming court found they
still enjoyed the experience.

“It was a lot of fun, campaigning
and all. I met a lot of nice people,
and since I am a resident assistant,
I had a lot of support from my
residents,” said Heidi Klingeman.

Sue Ann Dawson, a senior and
member of Delta Phi Epsilon,
sorority, said she wanted to run
for homecoming queen because
this is her last year here at Pitt.

“I thought it will be a good
memory of Pitt when I’m gone. It
was a good experience, and the
people were very friendly,” she
said.

LRDC staff saves receipts
for local grade school

By Margaret Swisher
Staff Writer

Pitt employees are helping
students at the Saint Agnes School
in Pittsburgh receive computers
and software by collecting Giant
Eagle cash—register receipts.

The Learning Research and
Development Center employees
last year raised over $30,000 in
cash receipts for the Saint Agnes
School and began their efforts
again last month, said Sharon
Lesgold, program coordinator and
research specialist at the LRDC.

The Apples for the Students
program sponsored by Giant
Eagle enables schools to fill their
computer needs, said Vicki Clites,
Apples for the Students
coordinator.

“This program gives us an
opportunity to help the children
without costing the schools or
taxpayers money,” Clites said.

Saint Agnes School’s

coordinator, Sister Patricia Anne
Skowronek, religious sister of
ministry, said the LRDC’s
participation was due to Lesgold’s
willingness to volunteer to collect
receipts.

“Last year we were able to get
over $311,000 [total] in receipts,”
Skowronek said. “We are really
grateful that they collect for us.”

Lesgold noticed students
collecting cash—register receipts
while conducting a fraction study
with first-graders at Saint Agnes
School for the LRDC in the fall of
1988.

“I thought it was a good idea to
collect receipts,” Lesgold said.
“It’s our way of paying back the
school for all the help they’ve
given us.”

Research specialist Nancy Bee
also helps to collect cash-register
receipts at the LRDC.

“With two of us we have access
to more people,” Bee said. “It’s

City courtrooms provide setting for new PBS film

By Kristene M. A. Bondi
Sta_[)"Wrlter

Pittsburgh will be the scene for
Darrow, an upcoming PBS film
that will begin shooting Nov. 2,
according to Robert Curran,
director of the Pittsburgh Film
Office.

On Friday Curran held an
informal conference titled, “Talk
and Get—Together on Filmmaking
Opportunities for Students in
Pittsburgh.”

The conference, held in Room
501 in the Cathedral of Learning,
was an opportunity for students
to meet the film’s producer,
Richard Heus.

Heus also explained how
Pittsburgh was chosen for the site
of a film which is supposed to
take place in Chicago and Los
Angeles.

“Chicago was out of the
question. It has too much modern
architecture to film a period piece
there,” Heus said. The film takes

place from the turn of the century
to 1925.

Also considered were Toronto
and Minneapolis, according to
Heus. He explained that Toronto
was too expensive, and
Minneapolis did not have the
period quality.

The main factor in Pittsburgh
becoming the shooting site was
the turn-of—the—century court
rooms that have been utilized in
other films, according Heus. He
said, “I was taken through 40

potential court rooms [by Curran]
in one day. The court rooms here
were exactly what I wanted. The
architecture hasn't changed.”
Curran, whose office is
responsible for bringing
filmmakers to Pittsburgh, said he
acts as a liaison between
filmmakers and the city.

Heus and Curran also told
students that internships are
available on Darrow and through
the Pittsburgh .Film Office.

Rape
Continued from page 1
societal groups involved are
forced to split their affinities, she

said.

When a black man rapes a
white woman, a black woman
must split her affinities between
the black man and the white
woman, both of whom have been
historically victimized, she said.

In these cases accusation of
rape is perceived by some black
women as a way to persecute
black men, she said.

In the Stewart murder case in
Boston, where a white man killed
his wife but blamed the murder
on a fictitious black, Boston police
officers terrorized black
neighborhoods in search of a
perpetrator, she said.

It was a case of “white male
power against black male
impotence,” she said. Police
officers stopped, searched and
removed the pants of black men
in the street solely on the basis of
their skin color, she said. I

Smith said the Central Park rape,
in which the victim, an investment
broker, was beaten and raped
repeatedly by a group of black
and Hispanic teenage men, was
in and of itself heinous.

But journalists covering the case
circulated and resuscitated myths
with a rhetoric of animalism, she
said.

The New York City media
characterized the group of men
as a vicious pack and implied that
their behavior could be partially

attributed to that evening’s full
moon, she said.

Their imagery of the men was
subhuman, she said.

Although the tone was
appropriate to their crime, she
said that white males in New
York City used the victim as a
pawn to seize control of their
city.

Smith said that during the
controversy of the Central Park
rape, she heard someone say that

Signs must meet campus guidelines  

By Marietta Pacella
Sta_ﬁ‘IVr1'ter

Signs are being posted all over
campus for homecoming and for
students’ individual sales and
needs. However, there are certain
policies which must be followed
when posting these signs and
other forms of advertisements.

All campus buildings have a set
of guidelines and policies for the
posting of advertisements on
bulletin boards, walls and
individual glass showcases.

Buildings such as the Litchfield
Towers and all other residence
halls, the Cathedral of Learning,
the William Pitt Union, Clapp
Hall, Michael A. Benedum
Engineering Auditorium, Forbes
Quadrangle, the Music Building
and Langley Hall do not permit
the posting of sales
advertisements and/or personal

. advertisements for business. The

majority of signs approved are
advertisements for campus-
related events, activities and
organizations.

For example, at the union, all
signs must be approved by
building management on the main
floor at the information desk.

 I.RDC"‘——

our favorite school to work in;
the kids are great.”

A lot of students, faculty and
their families at the LRDC also
save their receipts.

Systems analyst Jamie Schultz
collects stacks of receipts from
his family and his in-laws.

“I’1l do anything that helps out
kids,” Schultz said. “That’s why
we’re doing all this crazy work
up here.”

Lesgold said that most of the
receipts are under $10, but they
really add up.

“Anyone who wants to
definitely = be grateful for it,” <
Lesgold said.

WHAT IF YOU DON'T GET
INTO THE GRAD SCHOOL ,
OF YOUR CHOICE? '

Sure, there are other schools. But why
settle? Kaplan helps students raise their
scores and their chances of being adrnit—
ted into their first-choice schools. Fact is.
no one has helped students score higher!

Signs are approved every evening
for posting, and once approved
they are posted either on the
bulletin boards on the lower-
level floors, or in the glass
showcases on the main floor.
There are glass showcases on
the main floor near the main
entrance to the building on Fifth
Avenue, between the elevators
and also on both sides of the
building's information desk. Signs
which are professionally printed

may be placed in these
showcases.
According to the assistant

director of residence life Jon
Conlogue, university residence
halls follow similar policies.

“All signs must be approved
before they are posted. If we
didn't set a policy in which
everything had to be approved
before posting, the residence halls
would be covered from floor to
ceiling with signs and
advertisements. It would defeat
the purpose of having signs
altogether. There would be so
many of them, no one would
look at them anymore. Not only
this, but it would also become a
fire—safety hazard,” he said.

“If a sign is posted that is not

approved, it will simply be taken
down,” Conlogue said.

As with all campus buildings,
the residence halls do not permit
the posting of signs directly to the
painted walls of the buildings.

“If a sign is removed and [its
removal] causes damage to the
paint [on the wall], the student
[who is responsible for posting
the sign] may have to pay for the
damages as a result,” said
Conlogue.

According to policy, signs and
advertisements are not permitted
to be hung on the walls of
classrooms or in the stairwells of
buildings.

Signs may also be posted on
the exterior of Amos Hall,
McCormick Hall and Holland Hall
as long as they are not displayed
on the portions of the buildings
that face the streets, according to
Conlogue.

“The signs must be facing the
quad and must be hung securely
and safely,” he said.

These signs do not need to get
formal approval to be displayed.
They may be displayed freely
unless they contain obscenities,
according to Conlogue.

Machinist makes research equipment from used parts

By Betty Saraﬁn
For The Pitt News

Hanging on the door to B78
Crawford Hall is a sign reading,
“The Best Little Machine Shop in
Pittsbu rgh. ”

Inside, machine shop manager
Frank Valentich can be found
working on his latest project, an
eight—tracl< rat maze with air-
operated doors.

The machine shop makes
equipment f or research programs.
“IIt‘sl a very integral part ofall the
research at this facility,” Valentich
said.

There are five machine shops
at the University of Pittsburgh;
they are located in Allen Hall,
Benedum Hall, Public Health
building, Chevron Science Center
and Crawford Hall.

Valentich said recycling is a big

part ofhis job. He takes machines
apart and determines what can
be used again. He uses throwaway
goods to make useful research
equipment.

He said, “I learned to recycle
early in life: gears, shafts, a lot of
electronic components.”
Valentich’s shop is involved in
biological sciences. At SB76
Benedum Hall the shop services
the School of Engineering. The

chemistry shop is housed in 234
Chevron Science Center, and the
physics and astronomy shop,
which is also an electronics shop,
is located in 500 Allen Hall. Also
servicing physics and astronomy
is a machine shop at 10/} Old
Engineering Hall.

The shop in the Public Health
building is no longerfunctioning.
According to Edgar Duncan, dean
of public health, it hasn’t been

operational for several years. "

Valentich’s shop has a one-
man staff. Among other things,
he has worked on a special brain-
implant device for Dr. Theodore
W. Berger of the behavioral-
neuroscience department. When
asked what the most unusual

piece ofequipment he ever mad?‘

was, he said, “They are all unusual.
Everything is made for a specific
purpose.”

Rape
Continued from page 2
“all the talk about race and class

was beside the point.”

But race and class
considerations are necessary in
cases of interracial rape because
neither the rapist or the victim are
purely gender beings, she said.

Smith cited another rape in
which the victim was described
by the media as a mildly retarded
white girl who was raped by a
group of white teenage males in

Virginia.

News coverage emphasized the
victim’s mental capacity and the
effects of the rape upon the overall
community, Smith said.

“Certain women’s bodies are
more valuable than others,” she
said.

Smith discussed Alice Walker’s
short story “Advancing Luna” as
an example of such a border
case.

The unnamed narrator of the

story, a black woman,
characterizes Luna, her white
roommate, in a negative manner,
both directly and indirectly,
according to Smith.

She describes Luna as being
attractive, but just barely, Smith
said.

This is an example of the “thinly-
veiled sexual competitiveness
between white and black
women,” she said.

In the short story Luna’s

admission to the narrator that she
had been raped by a black man
prompts silence, according to
Smith. I

The narrator chooses to grant
her affinities to the silenced black
male instead of the silenced white
woman, she said.

Smith said that Walker’s four
separate endings to “Advancing
Luna” indicate the unsolvability
of the issue for the narrator/
author.

“The story seems to unwrite
itself even as it is being written,”
she said. 1-

Smith said that during one of
her seminars she asked the
students to tell her whether they
identified with the narrator or
Luna.

“The story silenced a group of
ordinarily talkative students,” she
said.

According to Smith, of the

students who were eventuallgv

willing to state their opinions, the
black students identified with the
narrator and the white students
identified with Luna.

Smith was originally scheduled
to speak on “Fetishizing

Hafer is just oz little better. ..

This year’s race for the governor of Pennsylvania has
become a series of personal barbs, political attacks and,
above all, an evasion of the issues. Republican Party
candidate Barbara Hafer has criticized Gov. Robert Casey
for political attacks during the 1986 gubernatorial campaign
and has also attacked his pro-life stance. She also, during
the campaign, called Casey a “redneck Irishman.”

Casey, on the other hand, has defended his policies and
his record as governor since 1986.

Both candidates ducked the question of raising taxes,

"although each was perfectly willing to say that the other

wpgld dramatically raise taxes.

Casey’, ‘£3 kolxv/lelriibi’, his ‘ciiiisisteiitly eppeseid any
attempts to let women keep their choice to have an
abortion. As long as he remains in Harrisburg, women will
always have to worry about’ that threat. '

Hafer is not without her problems, however. As auditor
general of Pennsylvania, her record was less than
exemplary. Even in her campaign for that position, she
has far less political experience than Casey. This has been
shown in her failure to force Casey into the political
blunder that her campaign so desperately needs.

Also, during the debate, Hafer was rather nervous, and
that showed in her performance, as her delivery was
occasionally err/atic.

In a recent poll Hafer trailed Casey by as much as three
to one. Her campaign will need a powerful boost within
one month if she is to be successful in her attempt to
become the next governor.

By attacking Gov. Casey on abortion, however, Hafer is
exploiting his major weakness. This is an attempt by Hafer
to boost her poor showing in the polls.

But this attack is the only chance Pennsylvania women
will have if they are to keep their right to choose whether
or not they will be able to have abortions. Gov. Casey has
clearly stated his pro—life stance many times over the past
four years.

Recently, Casey supported legislation that would have
made abortion in Pennsylvania extremely hard to attain-
——a bill that was killed in Congress. During Tuesday
night’s televised debate, he stated that he would sign a
bill, as long as it was constitutional, which would outlaw
most abortions.

As a voting public we cannot allow this right to be taken
away.

Because of their respective stances on abortion, we
endorse Barbara Hafer for governor. Although she is not
a perfect candidate, she is the obvious lesser of two evils.

This Thursday marks the third annual National
Coming Out Day. On this day, people across the
country affirm their gay identities. On Oct. 11,
1987, over 600,000 lesbian, gay and bisexual
individuals, along with people with AIDS and their
friends, marched and rallied in

I'm here, I'm queer—get used to it

wasn’t that weird or even a sex party. People just
ate some snacks and conversed.

I only stayed for about a half an hour, then I left
— I still had my closet alienation. I didn’t attend
another Gay and Lesbian Alliance meeting for
three years.

Washington, D.C. They come
out of the closet, i.e., stop hiding
their lives from friends, family
and the world around them.
Some people don’t think gay

Mark
Smith

Then by the spring term

I started coming out. I worked at

a gay-affirmative job over the

summer, and I even met my
current ‘boyfriend.

people exist because they don’t
understand the “closet.”

Most people who know me think I could have
never been in the closet. Wrong! In fact it was only

‘during my fifth year as an undergraduate that I

came out to the point of no return.

As a first-year student I was almost completely in
the closet. Only some friends from high school
knew about my gay identity.

As a second—year student things began to change
— however, not a whole hell of a lot, let me tell
you. I attended my first Gay and Lesbian Alliance
meeting during the ’86 fall term. I wandered around
outside for about 30 minutes debating —-— “Should
I go in?” I remember that it had just stopped raining.
I stood across from the William Pitt Union on
Forbes Avenue. What prevented me from entering
the building is a complete mystery. Fear? Self-
hatred? I still resent this screwed-up world that
drives people into the closet and compels people
to hate and bash queers.

So anyway, I walked into Dining Room A. There
were about 30 gays, mostly men. Yikes. It was a
weird experience. Before this I had sneaked into
gay bars a few times.There my friends and I didn’t
interact with other people. At this meetingl was on
my own. I had to talk to gay men. I

“Was this a sex party?” I thought. “That's the only
thing that makes us different from heterosexuals?"
These and many other strange questions entered
my mind. I talked to a few people, trying to act like
I knew everything about the gay culture. I know I
acted foolishly, but so what? To my surprise it

But I still had coming out
to do. At the end of my fourth year I wanted to
attend Gay and Lesbian Alliance meetings, but the
group was inactive. I remember getting up the
courage to ask the woman at the union information

desk how to contact the Gay and Lesbian Alliance. »

It took me 10 minutes to think about how I should
phrase the questions.

The woman told me the name of the faculty
adviser, and I called her. Over my last year an
undergraduate I changed in so many ways. I went
from planning to live my life in some neuroscience
lab to fighting for gay liberation as a 1989-90
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance co—president.
How about that? But my story isn’t unusual.

I’ve been "bashed," harassed and called “faggot,” -. L

“queer” and “sicko,” to mention a few epithets. I
went through an educational system where in gym
class we played “smear the queer.” I attended a
university that doesn’t think there’s oppression
against gays because students, staff and especially
faculty live in the closet and are never heard.

But I’ve also been on talk shows. I’ve appeared ~ —

in newspapers, and I’m still alive. I have an almost
wonderful relationship with a good, caring man.
I’ve met some great people at the university. I’m
applying to graduate schools, taking a class, writing
for two newspapers, working another job and
volunteering with six to 10 organizations a week.

I’ve come a long way from standing outside in
the rain wondering if I should attend a Gay and
Lesbian Alliance meeting. So can you.

The Replacements
All Shook Down
Sire

-polish of Don ’t Tell A Soul has
been thrown out and supplanted
with the raw demo feel that graced
such previous efforts as
Hoolenanny and Let it Be.
Although the material is primarily
acoustic this time, All ShookDown
again delivers the diversity that
has made past Replacements
albums so accessible. The rustic,
up tempo sounds of “Torture”
and “Attitude” could easily bring
a saloon of shit—kicking ‘Mats
fans to their feet, while the crisp
cynicism of “Nobody” reflects
\X/esterberg at his poetic best.
Also, the album’s melancholic,
alcoholic ballads are as beautiful
and emotionally powerful as ever.

Although All Shook Down
doesn’t boast the rockers
characteristic of the ‘Mats of old

Since emerging from the
Minneapolis post—punk scene in
the early ’80s The‘Replacements
have never ceased to amaze even
the most stubborn critics. But for
some reason success and the band
just haven’t been able to hit it off.

Not that The Replacements
haven’t tried. Last year singer/
songwriter Paul \X/esterberg
ardently pursued stardom with
the commercially geared Don’t

Tell A Soul —— and failed.

With the release of their eighth
album, All Shook Down, The
‘Mats just might find success
waiting for them with open arms.

All Shook Down may very well
be Westerberg’s most brilliant
creation yet. Packed with slide

the album has all the criteria that
has undoubtedly made The

American bands. And the time
has come for the music industry
to learn to recognize them as
such.

Gene Loves Jezebel: Th

By Cheryl Neidlinger

For the Pitt News

When last year's San Francisco
earthquake rumbled near the
recording studio where Gene

Agpvesjezebel was recording, lead
singer Jay Aston considered it a
symbolic moment. The band had
been struggling for almost a year
following the exit of Michael
Aston, Jay’s twin brother and co—
lead singer, from the group in an
amiable but traumatic decision.
The change could very well have
been the end for the four

" ' maining members, but what
resulted was a new sound, a new
outlook and a much-needed
second wind.

The latest album, entitled Kiss
Of Life, is a breakthrough album
in many respects. Although Gene
Loves Jezebel had enjoyed
popularity in alternative-music
circles in both the United States

(‘and in the United Kingdom, no

release to date had drawn so
much attention to them. Their
current single, “Jealous,” is
receiving. heavy airplay on both
rock and alternative radio stations
across the country, providing the
group with a new, more
widespread audience and some
high hopes for their tour to start

‘Eater this fall.

In a recent phone interviewjay
Aston had a chance to tell the Pitt
news how he feels about the
recent changes Gene Loves
Jezebel has gone through, as well

as where he sees it moving in the
future.

About the split up:

“I suppose splitting up with
anybody, whether it’s a relative
or someone you are going with,
will be very painful. It's hard to
get straight answers on things
from someone when you’re close
to them. We could have split up
a long time before we did because
we weren't communicating as
we should have been. In a group
it is supposed to be about four or
five spirits working together to
make whatever. If you’re not all
kicking in there, it can be all
disjointed. We were
compromising each other —
Michael would sing songs that
maybe I should have been
singing. There would be changes
in album covers, lyrics, etc., that
we didn’t agree on. It became
something none of us were
ultimately happy about. Sure, it
was upsetting. The only band
I've ever been in is Gene Loves
Jezebel, and the only one I ever
sang with on stage is Michael.
Liberty is a wonderful thing, but
it can be terrifying if you’re not
used to it.”

About his role as chief
songwriter:

“Lyrics usually come through if
I'm feeling particularly lonely, or
if my skin breaks out one day or
any other everyday things. I may
even get upset about something
that happens politically in the

world. My next—door neighbors
are old people, and I worry about
what a tough time they have. All
these things force me into a state
of looking for something bright.
Whenever I’m down, I look for
light things to bring me up. Release
is my main objective when I write
songs.”
About forming Gene Loves
Jezebel:

“We wanted something that
really kicks against the grain; that
wasn’t just black and white. We
wanted sexuality as opposed to
middle—class uptightedness,
which we saw. We called it Gene

This scene from Full Metal jacket symbolizes the violent/ peaceful
duality of Rico's nature.

w PTS

dl
profile

Once known as “Nuke Winter”
and originally headed for
University of California at Los
Angeles for filmmaking, \X/PTS’s
program director and official Larry
Hagman fan Rico Gagliano is a
walking dichotomy.

“I like these romantic and
idealistic musicians,” said
Gagliano. “ButI also have a great
interest in those things that are
radically, off-the—wall violent. I
love action movies."

With his round (dare I say
Lennon-inspired?) prescription
glasses and black baseball cap
worn backwards, it’s hard not to
laugh or at least guffaw when
you’re talking to Rico. “I can
come across as this nice guy, but
I have all this interest in violence
and bloodshed,” he said with a

As program director, Rico's
job is like that of a cop. “My job
is to keep everyone on their
toes. I’m supposed to make
sure that nobody says anything
that is contrary to [Federal
Communications Commission]
regulations and that no
Obscenities go out over the air.”

Although instances with the
FCC happen very rarely if at all,
Gagliano does a lot of the
paperwork that it takes to run a
college radio station; filling out
logs and making sure all the t’s
are crossed and i’s are dotted.

Gagliano admires the freedom
that college radio offers. “In
regular radio everything is
mapped out for you, and you
can’t play anything that you
want. It’s like a computer
program based on audience
research and the format they
have, and you have no choice at
all in what you play. Part of
being a [disc jockey] for me is
having some sort of say in the
music you play. Your individual
personality can come out in the
music you play.”

Gagliano believes that the
cash is the best part of WPTS,

station. “There was this one woman
up here who supposedly gave
every male overnight DJ  fellatio.
She was the Overnight-fellatio girl!
That’s just a rumor though. I have
no way to corroborate that because
I was never an overnight DJ. We’re

not all prudes up here,” he said,_~3,_,-.

laughing.

Gagliano’s most bizarre and
stressful situation happened
recently when New York City’s
Cop Shoot Cop (an industrial garage
band) came for a WPTS concert.
“They stole my autographed picture
of Larry Hagman,” he said. “I met

[Hagman] in person when he was”
directing an episode of ‘Dallas.’ I‘ "

walked up to him and he gave me
a picture where he was smiling
and wearing his Stetson hat. They
stole it. Cop Shoot Cop also
autographed my Sonic Youth
poster, which I didn’t want them to
do. So basically, Cop Shoot Cop, if
yOu’re reading this, I want a new

Sonic Youth Poster and I want my K
Larry Hagman picture back,” he ’

said.

Gagliano likes working for WPTS
because, “unlike a lot of clubs on
this campus WPTS is one that has
an immediate effect on the public
at large. It goes beyond the college
because anyone can tune us in.”

Gagliano’s favorite books are
Michael Herr’s Dispatches and Ray

Bradbury’s Martian Chronicles. But  I

Rico’s true dualistic nature is
obvious with his favorite movies,
Wings of Desire and Full Metal

marriage, which I sadly had to
decline.)

Public Theater's Iguana makes wonderful night of theater

as
By Matt Goldstein
For the Pitt News

Tennessee Williams has created some
of the most challenging and sought-after
roles for women in contemporary theater.
Roles like Maggie in Cat On A Hot Tin

’ Woof Amanda in The GlassMenagen'e and

Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named
Desire are just a few. In The Night Of The
Iguana, Williams leaves his tragic hero T.
Lawrence Shannon in good hands with
Maxine Faulk and Hannah Jelkes.

The Pittsburgh area is left in good hands
with two of his works as well with Pitt
Theater’s production of Streetcaropening

ﬁn a few weeks and the Pittsburgh Public

Theater’s The Night Of The Iguana, which
kicks off its 16th season.

Iguana is set in 1940 at the rundown
Costa Verde Hotel in Mexico, where the
defrocked minister "turned tour director
Shannon, arrives with a busload of female

  

college teachers. Here he meets up with
the hotel proprietor, newly widowed
Maxine Faulk. He also meets Hannah
Jelkes, a sketch artist traveling with her 97-
year-old grandfather Nonno, “the world’s
oldest living poet.”

The story concerns the union of
Shannon, Maxine and Hannah, who are
struggling to break free of their past in
order to continue with their lives.

Williams fills out his cast of colorful
characters with two of Shannon’s tourists:
cranky Judith Fellowes, determined to get
him fired for the seduction of the forlorn
Charlotte Goodall, the youngest member
of the group, who is still dazed over the
minister. Taking care of the comic relief
are the Fahrenkopfs, a German family
staying at the hotel and relishing the radio
announcements of the burning of London.

In one scene Hannah (Helena Ruoti)
and Shannon (Marco St. John) share an
intimate moment when Hannah begs the

minister to free the trapped iguana.
Captured by Maxine’s houseboys to be
eaten, the iguana symbolizes their own
need to be set free and to understand one
another. They are alone on stage but for
Maxine’s shadow, which hovers in the
background behind the swinging doors of
the veranda.

Director Claude Purdy makes good use
of the Public Theater’s stage with the
audience on three sides. The standout in
the cast is Ruoti, who brings a slight
mysterious edge to Hannah. Alsointriguing
is Olivia Williams as Maxine with a loud
and bellowing Whoopie Goldberg—like
voice. As the disturbed Shannon, it is clear
that St. John is an actor of fine talent.
However, by the second act I grew tired of
his overdone antics, which seem more
comedic than tragic. John Straub is funny
as Hannah’s senile grandfather, who has
spent half his life trying to complete a
poem he’s writing. In supporting roles

Sheriden Thomas keeps the prudish college
teacher from being a caricature, and Clea
Montville is wonderfully naive as Charlotte
Goodall.

It also helps when the company has
been provided with such a realistic set on
which to move about. Designed by James
Sandefur, the set, with palm trees on each
side, conveys the seediness of a rugged
rundown resort. Martha-Halley’s costumes
are brightly appropriate.

If Iguana warrants a closer look I suggest
you pick up tickets a half hour before
curtain time, when students can get in for
half price.

The Night Of The Iguana runs at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater through Nov. 4.
Performances are 8 p.m. from Tuesday to
Saturday and 7 p.m. on Sunday. Matinees
are at 2 p.m. on Thursday, Saturday and
Sunday. For further information call 321-

Introducing a small working-class
town to an international lesbian
and gay ﬁlm festival may seem like
a far—fetched notion, but for the
last ﬁve years the Pittsburgh's Inter-
national Lesbian & Gay Film Festi-
val has opened the doors to our
provincial community. The festi-
val runs from Oct. 12-22 at the
following locations throughout the
city; The Artery, Chatham College,
the Fulton Theater, the Oakland
Screening Room, South Side’s Rex
Theatre and the University of Pitts-
burgh. Here are some picks.

The Times of Harvey Milk

This powerful documentary is
about Harvey Milk, the first openly
gay supervisor (city-council mem-
ber) elected in San Francisco, Mayor
George Moscone and the “boy

 

Tongues Untied J

next door" supervisor Dan White
who assassinated them both.
Friends and political allies recount
the life of Harvey Milk, his en-
trance in local politics and the
circumstances leading up to the
assassination. The ﬁlm earned an
Academy Award for Best Docu-
mentary. Directed by Rob Epstein.
USA, 1984

World War II film Memphis Belle is hi

By Paul E. Zeidman
For Tbe Pitt News

The opening shot of Memphis
Belle shows a group of young
men wearing military fatigues and
playing football on a field. An off-
screen voice gives a short
description of each man. We learn
that they are all around the age of
19, and that they are the crew of
the Memp/9isBelle, a B-17 bomber
in World War II.

The first thing that interested
me about this movie was that it
starred Harry Connick Jr., who
happens to be one of my favorite
jazz musicians. But when the
movie got started, I learned that
there was a lot more to it than just
ol’ Mr. New Orleans. Memphis
Belle is an excellent film that tells
a true story about 10 young men
who fought for their country in
the skies over Europe.

As the movie begins, we learn
that an Army public- relations
man (played enthusiastically by
John Lithgow) wants to get the
word out about the crew of the
Bellebecause if their next mission
is successful, they will be the first
crew to have ﬂown 25 successful

missions. But no one else on the
base is as gung ho about it as he
is. They just want to go on their
mission and come back in one
piece.

Although the first third of the
movie takes place on the ground,
it is during this time that we get a
good look at the members of the
crew. Before his final mission,
Capt. Dearborn (Matthew
Modine) says goodbye to his
plane (which is named after his
girlfriend). Because he’s afraid to
die, navigator Phil (D.B. Sweeney)
gets drunk and ‘throws up on
bombadier Val (Billy Zane).

After a delayed start, the
Memphis Belle ﬁnally takes off on
its last mission: bombing an
airplane-assembly plant in
Bremen, Germany. During the
journey, we get to really see the
airmen in action. They share the
fear of dying in combat and are
willing to help out one another
whenever they can. The aerial
shots are most effective in the
movie. When the German fighter
planes attack, you can sense the
tension and anxiety felt by every
man.

When the nose of another plane

Gagliano got a lot of
inspiration from his mother,
who is an opera singer, and
his father, who is a playwright,
“My parents brought me up
on The Beatles and Simon
and Garfunkel,” he said. “I'm
an only child and a spoiled
brat, which is why I like to
talk about myself.”

Rico, who thinks Pittsburgh
is a happening place for
filmmaking isn’t quite sure
about his plans after he

‘ graduates from Pitt in April.

“I’m a film-studies major; you
tell me what I’m supposed
with that.”

For now, Gagliano will
continue being the cop at
WPTS and working at the
Fulton Theater downtown.
He’s currently hoping that no
one will find out about how
he got those nasty purple

the plane fall, you can hear the
radio man’s voice crying out, “Oh
God, I don't wanna die!" as the
plane disappears into the clouds
below.

The message of Memphis Belle
is more than just “War is hell” —
it’s that a war was fought by
young men who were willing to
risk their lives for their country,
knowing that at any time they
could die. As Phil tells Val, “I
know you’re scared. We’re all
scared.” Each man has that
underlying fear of impending
doom, but they all do their best to
ignore it.

In the ﬁnal scenes, the Belle is
coming in to land, but one of the
wheels refuses to lower. This
refers back to the beginning of
the movie, when another plane
landed on one wheel and then
suddenly exploded. As the
ground keeps getting closer and
closer, you can read the fear on
each man’s face. Several of the
men start to sing “Danny Boy” to

NC-I 7 is latest development in film ratings controz/ersey

By Dmitri Ragano

Showcase Editor

Last week Phillip Kaufman’s
Henry and June became the first
film rated NC-17 (No Children
Under 17 Admitted). The Motion
Picture Association of America
created the new rating in response
to mounting criticism. It’s
uncertain whether NC—1 7 will help
the problem with the MPAA
ratings system.

And what is the problem with
the MPAA ratings system?
Censorship. Simple as that.

With its X rating the MPAA
controls what audiences can see
and what ﬁlmmakers can make.
Most theaters won’t run a film
with the stigma of an X rating. In
fact, many newspapers won’t
even run an ad for an X-rated
film. So when the MPAA decides

whether a movie should be rated
R or X, it’s probably also deciding
whether the film will be coming
to a theater near you.

Of course, Hollywood isn’t
going to make movies no one
can see. That’s why most directors
are put under contract to deliver
an R ﬁlm. David Lynch’s Wild at
Heart may have won the grand
prize at this year’s Cannes Film
Festival, but he was forced to edit
it for its American release. Usually,
as in the case of Wild at Heart
and Alan Parker's Angel Heart,
getting an R rating only required
cutting a few seconds. But should
the MPAA have the power to
make a director change his or her
film?

It’s not just artists, nerdy critics
and fervent free—speechers who
are crying censorship. In a ruling

comedy TieMe Up! TieMeDown!,
Justice Charles E. Ramos of the
New York State Supreme Court
wrote, “The present system of
rating motion picture G, PG, PG-
13, R and X is an effective form of
censorship. It is censorship from
within the industry rather than
imposed from without but
censorship nevertheless.” Ramos
strongly advised the MPAA to
“either consider proposals for a
revised ratings system  or to
cease the practice altogether.”

MPAA President Jack Valenti

says that the purpose of the rating
system is “to provide advance
information to enable parents to
make judgments on movies they
wanted their children to see or
not- see.” Seems like a good
enough intention. Problem is,
who should decide what’s fit for
children to see. and how do they
decide it? The MPAA routinely
gives extremely violent films PG,
PG-13 and R ratings, while a
sexually mild fl? n can get an X. Is
a tender sex scene and a brief
shot of pubic hair in Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down./ really more
disturbing to a young person
than Jack Nicholson scarring a
pretty woman with acid and
gleefully mass-murdering an
entire city in the PG—l3—rated
Batman?

“The problem with censorship
is that it’s so subjective,” says
Richard Rauh, film director of the
Pittsburgh Playhouse. “What
exactly is it that's offensive? Who

 E://X ~  
EME5

is it that makes such a judgment?"

TieMe Up! TieMe Down! is one
of many films that helped rekindle
the ratings controversy in the
past year. Others included Peter
Greenaway’s The Cook, The Thieﬁ
His Wife and Her Lover, Henry-
Portrait of a Serial Killer and
Wayne Wang’s Life is cheap 
but toilet paper is expensive. All
these movies had several things
in common: They were small,
ambitious, original works by
serious artists; they were made
and released outside the
Hollywood system, and they
didn’t deserve to be tainted with
the ,MPAA’s X rating.

Gary Kaboly, director of
exhibitions at the Fulton Theater,
stresses that, unlike the X, the
NC-17 rating is trademarked. “The
big thing is that porno theaters
won’t be able to use the
trademark. X wasn’t copyrighted.
That’s what originally designated
that those films couldn’tbe shown
in regular theaters.”

Kaboly thinks the new rating
will catch on. “It’ll be a slow
process. It’ll take a year or two 
Eventually there’ll be more NC-
17 films  If it makes money,
Hollywood will produce it. It’s as
simple as that.”

But there’s no guarantee that
theaters will accept an NC-17 ﬁlm
any more than they accept an X.

“A theater owner will guess
that the picture is still pretty racy,”
says Rauh, “He may convert it in
his mind that for his audience it’s

 
 

VIDEO GAMES

still an X picture  [They say]
Henry and June contains ‘erotic
lesbian scenes’, whatever that
means. A theater owner might
say ‘Uh-oh, it’s one of those X
pics’.”

Phillip Kaufman has made two
of the best films of the last decade
(The Right Stuff and The
Unbearable lightness of Being ).
It’s a shame that people who
don’t know better might lump his
Henry and fune, and Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down./ and the other
serious X’s, with grindhouse porn.
We’ll just have to wait and see
whether NC—17 helps matters.

There was a time when great,
serious films like Last Tango in
Paris, A Cloc/eworle Orange and
the Oscar— winning Midnight
Cowboy could don the X rating
without shame.

“With films like Midnight
Cowboy the X rating had a
respectability that it doesn’t have
now,” says Rauh, “and I don’t
know why that is. Maybe it was
the climate  we were coming
out of the ’60s. We’re just living in
a different time now.”

And how. In the '90s, in the
midst of a Reagan-Bush
puritanical legacy that wages war
on art, that tries to take much-
needed grants from artists, that
arrests people for making rap

music, the film— rating controversy.

isn’t exceptional. It’s just another
Sign of the times.

Art funk band Blurt bleats and squonks into Pittsburgh  

" Watching Ted Milton perform, it’s

55‘

possible to imagine him in his former
incarnation as a puppeteer on the artistic
fringe. His vocals leap about eccentrically,
and the saxophone squeals," bleats and
jerks up and down in time to the chunky,
chop-chop rhythms of Blurt’s guitarist and
drummer, Chris Vine and Nick Morcott.
Milton’s personal reﬂections spill out in
the form of Dada-like poetry inﬂuenced
by literary examples such as Kafka and
Chekhov (e.g. “If God had intended for
man to ﬂy/he would have fitted him up
with a black box”). Pagan Strings is the
latest collection of lyrics from Milton’s
prolific brain, but there’s a catch —— so far
it’s only available in book form, a set of

 

Saxophonist Ted Milton of Blurt.

handmade volumes made of unique

’ materials found in the streets of Brussels.

The audio component of the aptly named
Blurt can only be experienced live on their
“Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse” tour,
just now hitting North America after some
stops in Eastern Europe. Each performance
begins with a silent film documenting the
creation of the book, followed by the
band playing the songs contained within.

Blurt started honking 12 years ago in the
British post-punk aftermath with the single
“The Fish Needs A Bike” and went on to
Factory Records, the label that produced
Joy Division/New Order, A Certain Ratio
and Crispy Ambulance — wait, you say
you’ve never heard of that last band?

Pitt News File Photo

Unfortunately, Blurt has managed to
remain rather obscure here as well, despite
excellent receptions abroad of the later
albums on their Toeblock label (such as
Poppycocle and Kenny Rogers’ Greatest
Hits) and the 1987 licensing of the Smoke
T imeLP to Celluloid Records in the United
States — nine records altogether, plus a
12-inch dance single by Milton.

Though Milton has often been called the
best British sax player to avoid the
constraining “jazz” tag, he had to move to
Belgium to get closer to the teeming
intellectualism of Europe. And while the
highly theatrical Blurt could be described
as an avant—garde performance band,
they’re also eminently danceable,

 
  

ii!

 

especially if you’re into grand mal seizures.

Terms such as white funk or comparisons
to James Chance (orJames Brown for that
matter!) do little justice to describing their
sound, so I'll quit trying. As Village Voice
reviewer Richard Meltzer exulted back in
1981, Blurt is “SOMETHING YOU BETTER
JUST LISTEN TO EVEN AT IMPORT
PRICES." Luckily, Ted and crew have
decided to import themselves, Pagan
Stringsand all, making your life that much
easier. Ask for them by name.

Blurt will be performing at the Upstage
tonight with local experimental-music
ensemble The Year Zero.

Virginia Mountaineers came into
town and rained on Pitt’s parade,
38-24, leaving behind a dark
presence of frustration and
dejection that hung like a storm
cloud waiting to burst in the Pitt
locker room afterwards.

In the post-game interview

gloom and helplessness that
enveloped the players. The
Panthers’ major bowl hopes,
maybe even any bowl hopes,
were virtually extinguished, while
the shadow of a possible losing
season lurked in a corner.

“I asked myself ‘Am I giving
100 percent?” said Wright. “I spent
time evaluating my own
performance and seeing what I
have to do to improve. I can
work on a lot of things to make
myself better. I can go at practice
a little harder. I can watch the
game film a little more — lots of
things.”

“I think we have to be more
vocal,” said Van Pelt. “I don’t
think there was a lack of
leadership, we were just not as
vocal as we should be. There has
to be a self—motivation there.”

“The guys have a lot I'1'10’i.,’

Riddick.

Pitt was a 10-point favorite
entering the WVU game, but for
the third straight week the team
surrendered over 500 rushing
yards, more than enough to make
Hackett wonder aloud whether it
was the defensive schemes that
were failing or his players’
performances.

Hackett hasn’t changed any
defensive formations, indicating
that it was the personnel,
something Riddick agrees with.

“Schemes don’t win or lose ball
games; players do. We’ve got to
correct our V mistakes,” said
Riddick. “The [large numbers

_ Panthers ponder
sub—par first half

«a

By Rob Mazur
Staff Writer

With almost half a season
behind itthe University of
Pittsburgh football team has had
a week to reflect upon
itsdisappointing season thus far.
After a 2-2-1 start, injuries to key
players and lack of intensity have
hurt this team, picked by many
earlier this year to play in a major
bowl. Perhaps the only good
thing that has happened this year
for the Panthers is the Steelers’
offensive ineptitude.

With early blowouts against
Oklahoma and West Virginia and
a lackluster tie in Syracuse, many
were left questioning whether a
winning season would be
possible, let alone a bowl berth.
The players, however, remain
confident in their abilities. “We
know what we have to do,” said
senior inside linebacker Prentiss
Wright. “We can’t lose more than
one game the rest of the season.
If we do that we still have shot at
a major bowl.”

The one bright spot for the
Panthers this season has been the
offensive line. Allowing only one
sack of QB Alex Van Pelt through
five games, this young group has
done a good job. “We’ve played
against some of the best defensive
lines in the nation,” said junior
right tackle Scott Miller. “We’re

playing really well.”

Looking back upon their
disappointing play, the players
realize they need to get better in
order to continue play after their
regular season ﬁnale with Penn
State. “We came into the season
with really high expectations. It’s
really frustrating being 2-2-1, but
we can't get down on ourselves.
We have to put the first part of the
season behind us and go from
here.,” said Miller.

The week off has been a
welcome break for the players.
After losing 12 people to injuries,
they were battered and bruised
both mentally and physically.
While some of the original all-
Band Aid squad have returned,
some key players are lost for the
season. Steve Israel, punt and
kickoff return man, has elected to
have surgery on an injured knee
and will be lost for the remaining
six games. Senior outside
linebacker Nelson Walker is out
for the season. His replacement,
junior Curtis Bray, is probably
out for the season with a
dislocated right elbow.

If the injury situation was not
enough, players have also been
lost to non-football reasons as
well. Junior defensive end Todd
Pipkin has been lost for the season
because doctors have determined
it would be unsafe for him to

Miami joins Big East Conference

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

The University of Miami entered the Big East
Conference yesterday after university trustees
voted unanimously to accept the invitation.

Miami will begin participation in most sports
this fall. However, in football, the Hurricanes will
remain independent.

Pitt, Boston College and Syracuse will be
searching for a way to obtain a commitment from
the Hurricanes to participate in football. But this
does not necessarily mean the Big East will
become a football conference.

“We’re looking at possible alliances with the
ACC in the sport of football,” said Pitt’s director
of athletics Ed Bozik in a WFAE interview.

“The Southwest Conference has already
approached us. They’re looking for an eastern
presence in football,” he added.

The Big East extended the invitation to Miami
in part to be sure that Pitt, BC and Syracuse
would not defect to an all—sports conference.

“To be very blunt with you, our [Big East]
future was at stake," said Big East commissioner
Mike Tranghese.

“If the Big East and the University of Miami
could not have gotten together, I’m not certain
we had an answer that would have satisfied
football concerns at Pitt, BC and Syracuse.”

Miami’s successful Juggernaut baseball team
will also remain independent for the time being.

Miami becomes the 10th member of the Big
East Conference.

Fan apathy is appearing to be
taking its toll on Pitt footba1l’s
most emotional leader.

Linebacker Prentiss Wright,
long known for his expressive
antics on the ﬁeld, will still wave
his white towel, run up and down
the ﬁeld enthusiastically and
attempt to get the crowd into the
football game. But Wright is a
little tired of his efforts being in
vain.

“I get real disgusted, and I try to
get fans into the game, and a lot
of times I don’t get any response.
It’s the worst,” Wright said.

But Wright admitted that
unresponsive fans may be
partially the responsibility of the
football team. In past years, when
Tony Dorsett was here and the

Steelers were winning, fan
support was excellent, according
to Wright. But that support seems
to have dropped off with the
Panthers’ exit from stellar national
prominence on the football scene.

“Maybe when we start winning
games and performing like a
University of Pittsburgh football
team is supposed to, people will
get behind us,” he said.

However, Wright has been to
countless other places where fan
support is at a feverish pitch,
regardless of the situation the
home team is in.

“When I go to Oklahoma or
Syracuse, no matter what the
situation, fans are yelling and
screaming and are behind their
team. When we’re down here,
we have no support and it’s the
worst. I don’t think people realize
what a crowd can do for a team

on the field,” Wright said.

“Fans should be supportive
even though things aren't going
the way they should be. If we’re
down and people cheer, it lifts
the team up. But that doesn’t
happen that much,” he added.

Indeed, witnessing a game at
the Carrier Dome or at Oklahoma
Memorial Stadium is almost a
religious experience. The
stadiums are engulfed in a sea of
orange, or red and white. The
cheers are deafening, and it’s
hard to hear a person who is right
next to you.

Whether the Orangemen or
Sooners are up by 20 points or
down by the -same margin, it’s
hard to tell because of the
deafening noise and frantic
cheering.

Soccer team slips by Geneva, 1-0

make the save. Similarly, freshman Eric Duffy
had a superb blast that was deﬂected by a
defenseman out of bounds.

In a well-fought battle at Pitt Stadium the
Panther soccer team defeated the Geneva Golden
Tornadoes by a 1-0 margin. Despite the small
margin of victory the Panthers dominated most
of the game, controlling the ball in the Geneva
end for much of the contest.

Pitt came out smoking in the first half, spraying
the Geneva defense with tactical shots and
strong passes.

The Panthers managed three early shots on
goal but all were turned away by the Geneva
goalkeeper. Senior Nick Liberati had an excellent
scoring opportunity, but his shot hit the crossbar
and was deflected.

Late in the first half Geneva scored an apparent
goal that would have given it the lead, but the

After Liberati smacked another shot off the
crossbar, the crowd of 215 began to get restless.

After gaining control of the ball the 5-foot—9-
inch Tran smoked a ball at the net but was
denied by the goaltender.

Undaunted, Tran again launched a shot at the _.

net; this time, he scored.

After Tran’s spectacular effort the Geneva
team’s spirit was broken, and Pitt coasted to
victory.

“We were more skillful than they were,” said
Tran. “When we kept the ball down, we
controlled the game more. Our defense played
extremely well."

“We played well tonight. Once we settled

understand,  The week off gave
us a chance to get our problems
in focus.”

Last week was the first time the
Panthers have had a Saturday off
since training camp, and while all
the players enjoyed the time off,
each utilized the time in his own
way.

Mike LiVorio got to see his
younger brother play for Gateway
High, while Riddick did, well 

nothing really.

“I went home and just laid
around,” said Riddick. And
despite the normal weekend
barrage of televised gridiron
action, Riddick wasn’t tempted.
“No, I tried to stay away from
football for a while.”

Others, however, relished the
opportunity to watch someone
else play for a change.

“I just stayed in my apartment
and watched the games,” said

Wright. “I saw Stanford beat Notre
Dame; that kind of boosted me
up. I wanted Florida State to beat
Miami too, but that didn’t
happen.”

Van Pelt watched the Rutgers-
Boston College game to scout
the Scarlet Knights’ defense, as
did center Scott Miller—— after he
got out of bed at 2 p.m.

“I watched the Miami game,
but I kept flipping back to the
Rutgers game whenever they had

the ball to see how they were
doing,” said Miller.

The Panthers also had a chance
to heal some nagging injuries,
but the team’s injury list is still as
long as a small phone book.

This week’s casualties include
Curtis Bray, who dislocated his

Lady Lions cmsb tennis team

By Rob Mazur
Staﬂ" Writer

If women’s tennis serves as an indicator
for football in the traditional Pitt-Penn
State rivalry, then the Panthers of the
gridiron had better watch out in their
showdown with the Nittany Lions in
November. The Lady Lions from Penn
State invaded Panther country Wednesday
and left with a convincing 9-0 victory.

Penn State swept through singles action,
winning all six matches. These losses
meant that the Lady Panthers are 1-11 in
their last 12 singles contests. The No. 1
singles match between Julie LoPrinzi of
Pitt and Kelly Erven of Penn State was the
only close match of the day. It took Erven
about two hours and three sets to put
away a determined LoPrinzi, 7-6, 2-6, 6-1.

“This was an excellent showing for
Julie," said Coach George Dieffenbach.
“[Kelly Erven] is an outstanding competitor.
She has competed in the NCAA national-
championship tournament a number of
times. Julie showed great Pitt pride and
spirit today, giving her a good fight and
matching her shot for shot.”

The remaining singles games were not
even close. The Lady Lions outplayed and
overwhelmed their competition, winning
all remaining matches in straight sets.
They surrendered only five games to the
Lady Panthers in the last five matches.

In other singles action No. 2 Kathryn
Bratton of Pitt was defeated by Penn
State’s Tammy Okins-Nguyen, 1-6, 1-6. Jill
Cohen, Pitt’s No. 3 seed, was beaten by
Cathy Kissell, 1-6, 1-6. No. 4 Barb McCarthy
lost to Kerri Kohr, 1-6, 0-6. In No. 5 singles
Josie Neiswenter fell to Chris Vogel, 0-6,
0-6. No. 6 singles player Jen Farrington of

Penn State put away Pitt’s Cheryl Sheppard,
6-0, 6-0.

In doubles action, the Lady Panthers
did not fair much better, losing all three
matches and allowing Penn State a sweep
of the day’s action.

In No. 1 doubles, LoPrinzi and Bratton
lost to Andi Chiumento and Ann Slocumb,
6-2, 6-1. Cohen and Neiswenter were
defeated in No. 2 doubles by Okins-
Nguyen and Kohr, 6-0, 6-0. Penn State's
Kissell and Farrington completed the day’s
action by beating Pitt’s Sheppard and
Rachel Graham at No. 3 doubles, 6-0, 6-0.

“We scheduled two tough matches this
week ——- Penn State and Clarion earlier
this week — in order to get ourselves
ready for the Big East Championships that
are to be held this weekend at Seton Hall.

These two matches have been of the
caliber of competition we will face this
coming weekend. Clarion participated in
the Division II championships last year,
and Penn State has sent numerous players
to the NCAA tournament.

This was a good learning experience to
help prepare us for the heightened level
of play we will encounter this weekend.
Our goal this year is to ﬁnish out of last
place,” said Dieffenbach about the match.

While the team’s goal as. stated by
Dieffenbach, may seem to be a bit low,
consider this — the team has finished in
ninth place (last) for the past seven years.
This goal, when looked at in this light,
becomes more realistic.

The Lady Panthers return on Oct. 18 for
a rescheduled match with Duquesne
University. Following that they travel to
Youngstown on Oct. 23 for a match with
Youngstown State.

Zols leads V—ball to victory.

By Ryan Buncher
sum Wruer

Despite a surprisingly tough challenge
from West Virginia (10-8), the Pitt
volleyball team, ranked 16th by the
American Volleyball Coaches’
Association, won its seventh straight
match last night by scores of 15-4, 156,
15-4, raising its record to 15-2.

West Virginia led 2-0 in the second
game, but the Lady Panthers ran off 14
straight points. The relatively small Pitt
team actually had a height advantage on
the Mountaineers. That and too many
West Virginia errors were more than
enough to overcome an outstanding
defensive effort by the Mountaineers.

Junior Linda Zols led the team in kills
with nine, and junior Heather Hollands
was second with eight. The Lady Panthers
had only seven hitting errors on the way
to a kill percentage of .326, compared to
only .093 for the Mountaineers. They
out-dug West Virginia 51-38, with junior
Dee MacAuley tops on the team with 12.
One of those was the best play of the
match, with Pitt getting two consecutive
diving digs on a point it eventually won.

The team will be without star freshman
Ann Marie Lucanie, who is currently on
crutches and will be out for three to four
weeks with a sprained ankle.

Coach Sue Woodstra said it is
disappointing because “The team is at a
peak—— [playing] better than it was early
this season.”

The team was bolstered by the return
of junior Bridget Gary from a knee
injury. She and the other players have

turned up their level of play in recent
weeks.

“This team has the ability to  [turn
up its level of play]. We’re getting better
every match,” said Woodstra.

The team travels to Villanova Friday
night and Georgetown Saturday before
returning home for a showdown with
10th-ranked.Penn State.

“We’re real excited. It’s a big game,
and we expect a big crowd. We’re the
two best teams in the East,” senior Co-
captain Jenelle Lantagne said of the
Penn State match.

When asked if the team might look
past its matches Friday and Saturday in
anticipation of the Penn State match,
Junior Susan Zonneville said, “Villanova
and Georgetown are in our conference.
We want to make a statement that we’re
the best [in the Big East]. [But] I really
want to beat Penn State. We haven’t
beaten them since I've been here. We’ve
played them four times since I've been
here.”

Both players seemed upset by the
lack of attendance for their home games.
Last night a single West Virginia fan was
usually louder than the entire Pitt crowd.

“It’s a bummer that more people
don't show up,”Lantagne said.

“It’s upsetting. When we go other
places, even smaller schools, there are
more people. This place will be packed
lon Sundayl,” Zonneville said of the
attendance.

When it was brought up that the
Penn State match was at the same time
as the Steeler game Sunday, Lantagne
said, “We’re doing better than the
Steelers.”

Flames and Blues share top honors in Srnythe Division

By Derek Willis

and Brian Berger
For Tbe Pitt News

CAMPBELL CONFERENCE
Smythe Division

In this division there are Calgary
and Edmonton, and then there
are the other teams. lt’s not that
the rest of the division is that bad;
the Flames and Oilers are just that
good. In each of the last eight
years, one of those two teams has
made an appearance in the
Stanley Cup ﬁnals. But both must
adapt to personnel changes this
year

The Calgary Flames traded

When reading about it is no longer
enough. Take back the Earth with one

away Joey Mullen and got rid of
Coach Terry Crisp. New coach
Doug Risebrough needs to find a
leader at this club. It could be Joe
Nieuwendyk, who has made a
remarkable recovery following a
knee injury; his presence makes
the front line as good as anyone’s.
The talent is in place for another
Cup run, but the losses of Mullen
and Brad McCrimmon will disrupt
the team’s chemistry.

The Flames’ loss was great, but
the Edmonton Oilers must cope
with the departure of Jan Kurri,
who is playing in Italy this year.
Suspended goalie Grant Fuhr
didn’t really lose his starting job
last year (injuries kept him out),

next season, and Bill Ranford has
the job at least until then.

Finally escaping the Gretzky
shadow last year, the Oilers
proved that they are still a great
team, led by the talents of Most
Valuable Player Mark Messier.
Messier was nearly always
dominant last year, but
consistency is a question mark
this season. Without Kurri it’s a
different team.

A new team concept with the
Winnipeg Jets improved their
fortunes by 21 points last season
but cost them center Dale
Hawerchuk, who didn’t take to
the new system well. He was
dealt for defenseman Phil
Housley, who joins a legion of
offensive-defensemen on this
team.

The lack of muscle will hurt
Winnipeg. Still, Coach Bob
Murdoch is encouraged by the
play of Thomas Steen and Teppo
Numminen. Overall this team
Can’t compete with the top two
on the front line, but it has nifty
new uniforms.

For the Los Angeles Kings,

{it-WI‘ “S” I’ };igtF‘i-,.‘*:‘§'i w-¥.i,i§kri“:;(¢E JIM

health is a big factor. If the front
line, especially Gretzky, can stay
healthy, the offense can put on a
show. The Great One can still
raise the level of his linemates’
play. The biggest problem, other
than health, is maintaining
defensive consistency. Some of
the players are still convinced
that it’s OK to allow six goals a
game as long as they score seven.

While occasionally able to stiﬂe
other teams, the defense is
basically slow, and the forwards
gamble far too much. Of course,
any team with Gretzky, Luc
Robitaille, Tomas Sandstrom and
Tony Granato can’t be completely
ruled out, but lack of defense will
make this team suffer.

Speaking of suffering, the
Vancouver Canucks also must
get over an important loss, that of
Paul Reinhart, who was a
steadying factor on the defense.
The Canucks finished in the cellar
a year ago and will do it again.

A lack of muscle hurts this
team, and the drafting of 178-
pound Czech sensation Petr
Nedved did nothing to change
that. Offensively the Canucks

Norris Division

The St. Louis Blues may have
helped themselves more in the
off-season than any team in the
NHL. Defensively the Blues
signed Scott Stevens to a $5

million contract and named the‘

ex-Capital as their team captain.
Stevens’ rugged defensive play
blends nicely with an already
steady defensive corps led by
offensive—minded Jeff Brown.
On offense the Blues plucked
left wing Geoff Courtnall, who
just happens to be the second
leading goal scorer among left

wings the last three years in the "

NHL. The steady sniper joins 72-
goal scorer Brett Hull, 100-point
center Adam Oates, rising

superstar Rob Brind’amour, 35-

goal scorer Paul Mclean and
center Cliff Ronning, who scored
an amazing 134 points in 42
games in Italy last year.

The Blues’ firepower might be

the league’s best. Between the -

pipes the Blues have the highly
touted Curtis Joseph and the solid
Vincent Riendeau. With this kind
of ammunition the Blues are going
to hurt a lot of teams.

The Chicago Blackhawks
picked Chris Chelios from
Montreal in the off-season, and

his presence gives Chicago at

Trophy winner Doug Wilson, who
at 32 years of age scored 23 goals

Thomas, who is coming off a 40-

campaign. Denis Savard was lost

problem is he’s always injured.

On defense the Leafs can score.
Al Iafrate pumped in 21 goals last
year. He’s had knee surgery and
seems to be recovering nicely.
T om Kurvers and Rob Ramage
both had 50-point—p1us seasons.
But the team did allow the third
most goals in the league last year.
Reports out of Toronto say that
goaltending is no longer a
problem. Coach Doug Carpenter
feels he has three No. 1 goalies
on the squad.

This is highly suspect, and the
Leafs will probably give up a lot
of goals this season, but they’ll
also score quite a few. And that
means .500 hockey —— again.

The Minnesota North Stars
stink on the road. Unfortunately,

all their young talent will be on
the road to California as part of
the new ownership deal.

Goaltenderjon Casey won a team-
record 31 games last year. The

defense is ghostlike. Only Larry
Murphy has any scoring punch,

and the human relic Curt Giles

was voted the team's best
defenseman last year.

Up front the Stars added Bobby
Smith, Brian Propp and Ilka
Sinasalo, three aged veterans who
know how to win. They join 55-
goal scorer Brian Bellows and
soon-to-be-superstar Mike
Modano, who had 75 points in
his rookie campaign.

Because of Casey and the
addition of the three veterans,
the Stars should be able to eke
out a playoff spot in the NHL’s
ridiculous playoff pool.

The Detroit Red Wings have

a plethora of mediocre
goaltenders. Unless youngster Tim
Chevaldae develops overnight,
the “motor men” have no chance
of contending.

On defense the Wings have
added Brad McCrimmon from
Calgary to go along with Steve
Chiasson, who surprised with 14
goals last year.

McCrimmon’s presence should
help stabilize an inconsistent corp
of blueliners. Sure, Steve Yzerrnan
is unreal, but the keys to the
offense are the returned health of
centerjimmy Carson, the physical
presence of Bob Probert and the
development of No. 1 pick Keith
Primeau.

If these three can contribute.

immensely, the Wings might
challenge the Stars; regardless, it
should be a long, cold winter in
the Motor City.

“There's a new attitude on
the team, now. We had three
hard practices last week and a
good practice yesterday. I
think we needed last week to
recuperate and rest up. Our
goal now is to go 6-0 the rest
of the year,” said sophomore
left tackle Mike LiVorio.

“It was good to have time
off. We had a brisk practice
Monday and Tuesday.
Everyone seemed to be

enthusiastic and well-rested. '

We realize that the remaining
six games are of major
importance. We suffered a

hard loss to West Virginia, and

any more room for mistakes,”
said head coach Paul Hackett.

Rutgers currently sports a 2-
