Students continue to voice concer abot GB trat

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

From every which way, stu-
dents voiced their concerns
on the recent Student
Government Board retreat to
SGB President Jacob Brody
and administration.

Yesterd-ay’s SGB-sponsored
forum also brought responses

about the Nemacolin
Woodlands retreat from stu-
dents, administration and
Brody.

Some students were out-
raged by the cost and

‘ demanded an explanation to

why SGB went on this retreat.
Students were talking out of
turn and all at once to get
answers.

Director of Student
Activities Joseph Cavalla came

By Kelly B. Casey
Pbotograpby Editor

Two hours was not
enough time for members of
the administration to answer
the concerns of the nearly
90 students who attended
yesterday’s Student
Government Board-spon-
sored Open Forum.

Graduate and undergradu-
ate students fired questions
at SGB President Jacob
Brody as well as five mem—
bers of the administration in
the William Pitt Union

to the aid of Brody and
Allocations Committee Chair
Lisa Waslo.

He said that a few days
before everyone went home
for winter break, SGB advi-
sors and himself went over a
variety of scenarios for SGB’s
retreat. The arrangements
were made and they support-
ed Brody, but Allocations did
do its job by making the rec-
ommendation.

When the decision was
made, Cavalla said they fig-
ured there would be feedback
from students.

“Jacob Brody does not go
around spending students’
activities fees,” Cavalla said.

An audience member said
that he started a petition for
the impeachment of Brody.

Ballroom.

Many of the students’
questions were answered.
Other questions were not.

Josh Knauer, a Carnegie
Mellon student and member
of Pittsburgh Friends of Mt.
Graham, directed his ques-
tion to Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor.

Knauer said that he
believes the Mt. Graham
project is “culturally and
religiously [impeding] on the
Apache nation.”

Knauer asked O’Connor if
he thought that this project

other members of administration ﬁelded questions from students.

Dispute arises over transportation fee

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Some students let the
administration know how
they feel about the new trans-
portation/safety system and
fee at yesterday’s forum.

Steve Parks, president of
the Graduate and Professional
Student Association, and his
staff do not agree with all
full—time students paying the
$30 fee.

Their reasoning is that not
all graduate students live in
Oakland, so they do not use
the shuttles. Also, students
are paying for security, thus
GPSA said that students are
paying for the security of staff
and faculty.

“We really do not see that
the transportation program
addresses our needs, and we
were out of the loop when
the program was being devel-
oped. We’re going to be
charged a fee when we had
no input,” a GPSA member
said.

John DeVitto, assistant vice
chancellor of business and

was “offensive” to the tradi-
tions of the Apache Native
Americans as Pitt celebrates

W

Diversity Week.

In response to Knauer’s
question, O’Connor said, “I
think there is a difference of
opinion as to the effect of
the telescope project on the
Apache nation, just as there

finance, said that the adminis-
tration did contact GPSA and
adjustments do need to be
made.

“This period of time is an
adjustment period,” DeVitto
said.

According to DeVitto, since
Jan. 4, the new transporta-
tion system has shuttled over
72,()00 students.

“The fact is that we serve
not only graduate students,
but the entire university,”
DeVitto said. “If we can
accommodate everyone, that
is what we intend to do. What
we are looking for is what we
can efficiently do. We are
evaluating the system.”

DeVitto said that when they
set up the system, they
looked at zip codes of off-
campus students so the
majority of the students will
be covered by the routes.

Since adjustments do need
to be made, the administra-
tion is looking into expand-
ing the service to Shadysidc
and Squirrel Hill and working
with Carnegie Mellon’s trans-
portation system.

is a marked difference of
opinion on the adverse envi-
ronment implications.”

“The world is not of a sin-
gle mind,” O’Connor added.

O’Connor said that he
would be willing to sit down
and discuss the cultural and
environmental aspects of the
telescope project before any
final decision is made on
whether or not Pitt will join
the partnership of the
University of Arizona, the
Vatican and the Max Planck
Institute.

“I would be happy to dis-

Once all of the adjustments
are made, the fee
decrease, DeVitto said.

Student Linda Jarrett said
the bus system is great, but
there may be a problem pick-
ing up intoxicated people on
the hill.

DeVitto informed the audi-
ence that the bus driver is not
allowed to pick up an indi-
vidual that “looks, smells or
talks like a drunk." He said
the reason for this is because
there is no cleaning team
available and the student
would be in no condition to
clean any mess up.

Some students were posi-
tive about the new shuttle
service.

“The buses are great. I love
them,” a Forbes Hall resident
said.

Addressing the question of
why students pay for every-
one’s safety, Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor said that the
administration is currently dis-
cussing how the staff and
faculty can pay for their
share of the security part of
the fee.

said, after Knauer invited
O’Connor to meet with a
representive of the Apache
nation and environmental
experts from Tucson, who
will be coming to Pittsburgh
on Feb. 22.

“Why don’t you get on the
calendar?” O’Connor asked.

Knauer insisted that he has
tried since November and
has had no luck.

“Call after this meeting,”
O’Connor said, which
sparked laughter.

Racial issues ‘notjust blade and white’

By Beth Kovaly
Asst News Editor

Brian and Arlen are each
out with a few friends on a
Friday night. The two groups
meet in the Towers lobby. An
argument between the two
students begins with racial
remarks and turns into a
fight. Brian is African
American, Arlen is white.

Campus security arrives,
pushing through the crowd
to break up the fight. Brian is
pulled away but lunges
again, and one officer hits
him with a night stick. Brian
is led away.

Someone in the crowd
comments, “If he was a white
guy that never would have
happened.”

“What would you do?” is
the question addressed to the
small audience watching the

skit in the William Pitt Union.

Diversity Week ‘93 contin-
ued last night as the Office of
Residence Life hosted “It’s
not just black & white  race
relations at Pitt.” Several stu-
dent groups participated,
including the Black Action
Society, Kuntu Repertory
Theater and the
Contemporary Black Drama
class.

Students wrote and pro-
duced a video and several
skits on race relations at Pitt,
depicting segregation, room-
mate tension, job interviews
and interracial relationships.

After each skit, panel mem-
bers were asked to briefly
describe how they would
resolve the situation.

Patricia Wright, from Pitt’s
School of Social Work, said
she saw a loss of individuali-
ty in the first skit involving

police and student interac-
tion.

“They were representing
their various ethnic groups
—African American and
European American -—— into
the roles that they are accus-
tomed to in society,” she
said.

Public Safety officer and
panel member Sgt. Charles
Grier, who portrayed the offi-
cer with the night stick,
explained the reasoning
behind his actions.

“When I was attempting to
get into the situation, in the
scenario [Brian] actually
punched me,” he said.
“Because it was a mob scene

. I reacted with my night
stick. I didn’t hit him in the
head, I hit him in the arm, to
get him away from me and
try and stun him.”

False alarm in Forbes
Hall angers residents

By Frank Porco

Staff Writer

Angry Forbes Hall residents complained during yester-
day’s open forum about abuse they said they received
after a false alarm was pulled.

After not evacuating during a false fire alarm on Dec.
18, 22 students were cited $1,025 each, and one student

was arrested.

Resident Laura Dennis said the alarm was the sixth one
set off that week.

According to Alison Hanlon, another resident of the
hall, the alarm set off mass confusion. Campus police
knocked on doors and told students who were not awak-

year as well. Over a dozen
helmets were stolen from the
Pitt Stadium football locker
room in a series of thefts
throughout the fall.

Campus police cleared 130
of last year's thefts through
arrest or recovery of the
items. Because of the quick
and dirty nature of the crime,
it is often difficult to catch the
Culprits.

Despite this, the police
were very successful last fall
in catching bicycle thieves. In
one case, officers arrested two
Monroeville youths breaking
locks with a hydraulic jack.

Brody quickly responded,
“On the charge of?”

The member answered,
“On the charge that you
went over the budget.”

That brought response
from other students in the
audience. Some said that if
Brody was to be impeached
for of going over the budget
then so should the president
of the United States or Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor.

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs William Harmon said

that this retreat has been a
-standard practice and the
costs have ranged from
$5,000 to $10,000.

“This has gone on for I
guess 15 years.
Constitutionally [Brody] has
done nothing wrong. The
Allocations Committee is
there to make recommenda-
tions,” Harmon said. “So, in
essence, what you’re doing
is saying Brody made a
decision which happens to
be one that you disagree
with. Can you impeach, or
do you want to impeach,

someone because they made
a decision that you disagree
with?”

Brody admitted that it was
a mistake and it has hap-
pened. “I am asking the stu-
dent body that we now
move on and let the SGB
begin work,” he said.

A student in favor of
Brody said that SGB is an
informal learning process
and if he learned something
then that was the good part.

Brody responded, “Yes I
did [learn something].”

This learning process has

brought about retreat
reviews.
“Students were outraged
by the cost, but what I’m
trying to say is that it is time
for SGB to do the work for
the students. We’ll also
review the SGB retreats as
well as reviewing the
retreats of other organiza-
tions and set up standards
so this kind of thing does
not happen again,” he said.
‘‘We’ll learn from our mis-
takes and move on. I’m not
saying let’s put all of this in
the past.” 0

because after they were cited,

attorney but he was never
there or he would not be
there for the whole time,”
Fournier said.

According to Dr. William
Harmon, vice chancellor of
Student Affairs, the biggest

problem is the false fire

alarms being pulled arotind

Harmon said that Pitt pays

off on campus.

prits are never successful

conflicts between roommates:

Melanie a racist, Melanie
replied, “I’m not a racist.
Hey, I have black friends.“

Justice is necessary

Yesterday afternoon in the ballroom of the William Pitt
Union, there was an open forum for students to express their
many campus concerns. Campus safety, Mt. Graham and uni-
versity military research were a few of the issues discussed.
But as could be expected, the focus of this meeting turned
toward the extra money spent by the Student Government
Board at Nemacolin Woodlands. Most of the students
expressed their outrage at SGB President Jacob Brody.

Some students called for impeachment. Others cried victim-
ization. Some came to his defense. One student went so far as
to scream that he didn’t have enough money to buy his books
this semester, while Brody was taking his student fees and
spending them on lobster and steak. In the end, the meeting
turned into chaos and much of the mob lost sight of the real
issues.

There is no doubt that the tn'p’s excessive price tag is cause
for serious concern. But, regardless of how much money they
spent, people will always complain about the price tag. The
real issue is the fact that Brody overspent money that was
knowingly denied to him. One student came to his defense by
saying that this is hardly grounds for impeachment, and if it
was, the past two U.S. presidents would have been impeached
several times over.

The difference is, however, that U.S. presidents are allowed
to incur deficits. According to the allocations manual, the SGB
can’t. By overspending the money they ignored the rules that
everybody else has to abide by. In the short" run students have
to pay for this trip out of their activities fees. That seemed to
be the rationale behind those SGB members who voted against
denying the funds. Contrary to those members, however, vot-
ing for the funding will not allow us to “just move on.”

In the long run, though, students must receive their justice.
We are still wary to call for impeachment, although there
seems to be some justification for it. It strictly states in the allo-
cations manual that deficits will not be funded. What would
happen if the governance groups and various other organiza-
tions on campus now decided to overspend their budgets? In a
sense it would be understandable, since their own leader did it
without any repercussions. Only after students receive their
justice will Brody and the SGB be able to move on.

One suggestion — albeit a symbolic one —- is for allocations
to cut SGB’s budget for the next four years until the money is
returned. The obvious‘ problem here is that not all students
involved will be given justice. A second suggestion is to go
cold turkey and slash SGB’s budget for this year. This, howev-
er, will limit its effectiveness and hurt everyone. Finally, Brody
could give back some of the money from his tuition reimburse-
ment. Although Dr. William Harmon, the head of Student
Activities, called this a “stupid idea” at the forum it will bring
justice to all of the students and allow Brody and the SGB to
finally move on. Progression is hardly stupid. Sweeping it
under the covers is.

Whatever the plan of action, there must also be steps taken
in the allocation process to assure that this will not happen
again. Although it is a feeble excuse, there is some justification
in the statement that Brody was not around when the decision
was made and that he had to go against allocations. Therefore,
to avoid problems like this one, the new SGB should convene
in December with the purpose of planning its retreat. This
way, even if there are a few bumbling fools, one member
should at least have the common sense to put out the error of
their ways.

SGB president could learn from Clinton

Dear Czar Brody,

I know that I am merely a
lowly subject and of no conse-
quence to one so great.
Therefore, my opinion proba-
bly means nothing to you.
However, I have observed that,
so far, your presidency is not
going very well. If I may be so
bold, I would like to offer a
suggestion to help you traverse
these “troubled times.” What
follows is a description of a
new class that maybe you have
not heard of and I think you
should take.

“Bill Clinton 101.”

This class is an introduction
to Clinton studies and will look
at various aspects of Clinton’s
campaign for president. The
basic theme of the course is
how Clinton worked to forge a
consensus and maintain (or
increase) his popularity.

Requirements: two take-
home midterms, a final exam
and daily attendance. N.B.
weekend retreats will not count
as excused absences.

Prerequisites: none.

Students who may he interest-
ed include anyone who is elect-
ed to office and is seeleing to
form their own consensus or
find themselves to he unpopu-
lar. Students with high office
positions, such as SGB presi-
dent, should he extremely inter-
ested.

That is
description, mein Furhur. I real-
ize the add/drop period is
over, but I’m sure someone of
your overwhelming importance
will have no problem getting
into the class.

However, I realize you are
probably not used to taking the
unfounded advice of one of

your lowly subjects. Therefore,
I’ve provided an example of
one of the lectures.

Lecture #1: “Avoiding scandal
and maintaining momentum.”

President Clinton ran one of
the most masterful campaigns
in history, even former
President Bush admits that.
One of the keys to the cam-
paign was avoiding scandalous
issues and maintaining momen-
tum.

First let’s deal with scandals.

Tom
Stein

the basic class‘

One of the earliest threats was
Gennifer Flowers. To stave this
off Clinton appeared with his
wife on “60 Minutes” after the
Super Bowl, thus ensuring a
captive audience. While he
never directly denied the affair
he turned it into a non-issue.

Of course Clinton wasn’t as
effective on all potential scan-
dals. ‘His “I didn’t inhale” com-
ment stayed with him until the
end of the campaign. But by
that time it was just a joke and
had little impact. The only real
scandal that hurt Clinton was
the draft issue. However, he
minimized this by receiving
endorsements from high mili-
tary men in the Bush establish-
ment.

To move on, the second part
of the lecture was on maintain-
ing momentum. One of the
keys to Clinton’s campaign was
re-establishing momentum
when he had none. A prime
example of this is the New
Hampshire primary. In the
wake of Gennifer Flowers and
attacks by Tsongas and other

Democratic hopefuls, Clinton
quickly went from a command-
ing lead to a distant second in
the polls. Clinton finishedt bet-
ter than expected, but was still
second.

However, Bill didn’t let this
daunt him. Labeling himself the
“Comeback Kid” he became the
first man to lose N.H. and win
the presidency.

Another example is when
Clinton surged from 19 percent
to a commanding lead in the
early summer. He used appear-
ances on “The Arsenio Hall
Show” and other talk shows, as
well as his town/ meetings, to
connect with the voters. Then
the helpful withdrawal of Perot
and the Democratic Convention
put him over the top.

That is just an example of the
many things you can learn,
Kaiser Brody, in a course
examining Bill Clinton. This is
just my lowly opinion, but I
think you could stand to learn
a little more about avoiding
scandals and increasing the
public’s opinion of you. But, in
case you are still not convinced
this class is for you, I have
included a copy of the final
exam question.

Bill Clinton had a nickname
that, while his enemies loved to
use it, was probably a close
portrayal of him. Here was a
Democrat who could campaign
like a Republican.

Question: What former
Republican president had a
nickname similar to “Slick
Willy.” Here’s a hint, his nick-
name was “Tricky

Rodney Dangerfrelds no more.

With their recently anointed and well-deserved
number-13 national ranking in tow, the hottest team
in the Big East — the 13-2 Pitt Panthers — retum to
action tonight when the Syracuse Orangemen visit
the Civic Arena for an 8 p.m. match-up.

For senior power forward Chris McNeal, the props
of a high national ranking is positive, but it won’t dis-
tract the team from doing what its done all year long
— win.

“That’s a pretty high ranking,” McNeal said. “I
guess everybody will be shooting for us  being
that we’re ranked so high. We’ve just got to take it
one game at a time.

into battle with C11 IS   hable Orange

Not by coincidence, that happens to be true.

The 1992-93 Syracuse season was short-circuited
prematurely when its basketball program incurred
rules violations. The team’s penalty is no NCAA bid
in 1993. l‘ _

With a beatable opponent on the horizon next to a
gaudy nrunber—13 ranking, is there any chance the
Panthers will be distracted? Uninspired?

Pitt forward Antoine Jones says there is no chance.

“We’re not worried about Syracuse,” Jones said.
“We’re worried about Pitt. Whatevefs going on in the
Syracuse program, we can’t control that. We can only
control our own destiny.”

A key to the success or failure of the less-than-for-
midable Orangemen roster is rebounding. The ‘Cuse
is 7-1 when it outrebounds an opponent — just 3-4
when it doesn’t.

Syracuse Orangemen, the alwaysexpecting-but
neverdelivering Panthers are halfway through the
1992-93 college basketball season virtually
unscathed, winning 15 of 15 games to date and
vaulting to within percentage points of first place in
Big East play with a mark of 6-2.

Led by the wondrous efforts of pointmaster Jerry
McCullough and Misters Mobley, McNeal and com-
pany, the Panthers have eclipsed even the most
optimistic of expectations by winning, winning and

But what separates this edition of Panthers hoops
from past hopes (and proceeding failures) -— and
what makes ‘93 the year the Panthers see the sec-

UCLA or Duquesne — or a final minute heads-up

Hurricanes, the Panthers have stepped up with per-
sistent inspired play —— responding in quandary
after quandary all year long.

“Down the stretch [in games] everybody just pulls

say ‘we can’t lose this game!.’ Instead of pulling

By George Klimis
Staﬂ Writer

Dave Senay may have been
called many things in his life, but
one thing you will never hear said
about Pitt’s senior shot-put throw-
er is that he is a quitter.

After sitting out all of last season
because of knee surgery, the
Washington, Pa., native is quickly
making up for lost time. And he’s
picking up where he left off two
years ago.

“Mentally, I feel more confident
in certain aspects of competition,”
Senay said. “Physically, it’s 50/50
because my knee still hurts, but
my upper body is the strongest it
has ever been.”

In August of 1991, Senay under-
went surgery to repair knee dam-
age from “overuse.”

“There was a big hole through
the cartilage and a hole in the
actual bone,” Senay said. “They
went in to take out excess carti-
lage and to smooth it out.”

It wasn’t until this past June
when that Senay finally threw the
shot-put again. At first there were
complications as a result of the
surgery.

“When I started throwing in the
summer, I had a lot of battles with
tendonitis,” Senay said. “But the
doctors warned me about that.”

“He could of said, ‘The heck
with all this, I’m going to sit back
and enjoy my last year,’” Pitt
men’s track and field head coach
John Vasvary said, “but he decid-
ed to come back.”

Two weeks ago at the Ohio
State Invitational, Senay finished
fourth, throwing the shot 49-1 1/2.
The Eastern Championship
(IC4As) qualifying throw is 5()
feet.

“That was my best performance
so far,” Senay said. “The first cou-
ple of meets I was sluggish and I
didn’t have any confidence in my
throw.”

Senay did have one toss over
50 feet, but he fouled, which dis-
qualified the throw.

“The foul was so minor, so I
know I’ll improve,” Senay said.

This weekend at Virginia Tech,
Senay frrrished eighth in the shot-
put with a throw of 48-8.
However, Vasvary said that Senay
may have expended to much
energy this week in the weight

THE Pl'IT NEWS, Wednesday, January 27, 1993

Syracuse

Continued from page 8
- more rebounds a game  we
still have to go in there and
rebound hard.

“They‘re‘ going to come in
here with the intention of
knocking us off. They don’t
care too much about us.”

Another major advantage for
the Panthers heading into the
‘Cuse battle is the play of the
Pitt reserves. While Pitt has
received major contributions all
season from its starting five of
McCullough, McNeal, Mobley,
Jones and Ahmad Shareef, it’s
safe to say Pitt wouldn’t be on
the brink of first-place in the
Big East without the men with
the warmups on.

As far as how the latest Pitt
reserve squad stacks up,
McNeal compares the depth of
the ‘92393 Panthers to the ‘90-
’91 Pitt team, which featured
Bobby Martin, Brian Shorter,
Darelle Porter and Jason
Matthews. While “Big Daddy”
calls the talent of the two
squads “pretty equal,” there’s
one facet of this year’s team

that, in his mind, puts today’s
team a step ahead of the ‘90-
’91 squad.

“With this team, we seem
like we can get out on the fast-
break —— mn a little bit more,”
McNea1 said. “Also, some of
our bench players give us a
real good spark  some posi-
tive minutes.”

The play of the Pitt Bench
Battalion — Brian Brush,
Orlando Antigua, Marlon
Rhymes, Garrick Thomas and
Brock Generalovich — has
been a pleasant surprise,
according to McNeal. He knew
the effort, the desire to win
was there. It’s the impressive
production thafs been the key.

“We saw the guys’ work
ethic [in camp], but I didn’t
really expect the guys to come
through the way they’re com-
ing through,” McNeal said. “If
somebody gets into foul trou-
ble  or if someone isn’t hav-
ing a good game, we can
count on those guys coming in
and picking us up — defen-
sively and offensively.”

Senay

Continued from page 8
room, which affected his perfor-
rnance.

Although Senay has not yet
qualiﬁed, he said he is not wor-
ried about it because he knows
it’s going to happen.

“I know I can throw 50 feet
and even further,” Senay said. “It’s
just going to take time. I should
throw my best by the Big East
tournament at 52 or 53 feet.
Anything less and I won’t be satis-
fied.”

“He’s been making solid
improvements,” Vasvary said. “For
him, it’s just getting back into the
groove.”

Besides his accomplishments
on the field, Senay has been
equally impressive in the class-
room. He has been invited to a
luncheon sponsored by Bell of
Pennsylvania to honor student
athletes with QPAs over 3.0.

Senay, a biology and neuro-
science dual major, is planning to
continue his education by attend-
ing graduate school to study
physiology.

“I’d like to stay in the research
ﬁeld, which is what I’m interested
in," Senay said. “I’d like to stay
here at Pitt.” .

Senay said he is curious about
the human body and would like
to study ways to increase athletic
peifomiances without the use of
drugs.

When it comes to competing,
Senay wouldn’t mind it being out-
side. Besides throwing the shot
indoors, he throws for the out-
door team.

‘‘I’ve always done better out-
doors,” Senay said. “The shot is
smaller and I have small hands.”

Senay also contributes his better
performance to the circles from
which the competitors must

throw. Senay said that each
indoor facility’s circle is built dif-
ferently, and some are not as
durable as others.

“At West Virginia, I pushed so
hard with my left leg that I moved
the whole circle,” Senay said.

Outdoors, the circles are made
of concrete so Senay doesn’t have
the same problem.

Another thing other teams
should be aware of during the
outdoor season is that, according
to Vasvary, Senay is an excellent
hammer thrower.

But right now Senay is concen-
trating on the indoor meets and
trying to get a feel for the compe-
tition.

“For me the indoor season will
be adjusting to the whole track
and ﬁeld scene,” Senay said.

But just for Senay to be com-
peting, whether indoor or out-
door, is a feat in itself.
