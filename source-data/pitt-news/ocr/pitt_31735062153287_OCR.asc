the graduate manager plan will solve
this problem, do hereby petition the
chancellor, J. G. Bowman,. for a
Graduate Manager to control all stu-
dent activities, excepting athletics-
our reasons for so doing being that:

"Secondly, under his guidance in-
ternal .friction would be reduced and
gralually abolished.

“Firstly, because he would develop
conditions in a business like manner,
promoting eﬂiciency, economy and
progress, having had the lasting
beneﬁts ofya ﬁeld ‘of ‘experience.

“Thirdly, useless ‘activities that
did not promote the better interests
and welfare of the school could be
abolished upon his recommendation. .

“Fourthly, he will have the check

on all student managers and activity
leaders and will be able to’ make
them abstain from anything that
would be detrimental to the inter-
‘ests of the activity concerned, He
will relieve the animosity caused by
.the present committee controlling ac-
tivities. ‘ ’

“Fifthly, that he will direct all ac-
tivities in such a manner to pro-
mote harmony, co-operation and suc-
cess so that eventually these activi-
ties will ‘rival their fellow athletic
activities in prominence . and will
boost the spirit of the University and
increase the student morale.”

THE HEART OF -PITT

The new staff of The Weekly already has begun its work with

the publication ofthis issue. It succeeds a staff, headed by Maxwell "

E. I-Iannum and William G. Lytle, Jr., which ably upheld past rec-
ords, despite uncontrollable diﬁiculties and obstacles. _
Serving more than 6,000 alumni and students; The Weekly holds

.. together this numerous group with its varied interests.

In it ‘the

students seek not only the accounts of their particular activities,’ but
also news of organizations with which they are notpconnected, in or-
der that they may be familiar with the doings of the entire school;
‘through it the alumni are kept in close touch with their Alma.

Mater.

The school paper is the heart and strength of the institution.
The aim of the new staif is to typify truly the heart of Pitt.

A LITTLE DOPE 1;  

KERR’S COACHING ABILITY RECOGNIZED

The appointments of Andrew Kerr and Lou McMas:ers as coaches of
the varsity and freshman basket ball teams, ‘respectively-,— for next year
have met with almost unanimous approval of the student body and of the
alumni. A great deal of regret Is expressed over the leaving of Dr. Flint,
whose eight years with the University have put basket ball on the plane
that it occupiectoday. .
all lines of athletics. Primarily a professor of mathematics, coaching with
him was a side-issge, but so great were his successes ﬁat he now devotes
as much time to athletics ashe does to his teaching.- Hsfame began with
the great athletic teams he always produced at old Central High School,
teams whichcontributcd some of the greatest collegiate olayers the country
has ever known. At the height of his success with scholastic teams, ,.a
city ruling was passed requiring the physical instructor in the high schools
to do the coaching. This meant to old Central and now‘Schenley High the
loss of its greatest coach and never since have the athletic teams repre-
senting those schools bécn on a par with the teams ofthe days of Coach
Kerr. But what was loss for the high schools was gain for Pitt, for shortly
after the ruling was passed, Mr. Kerr came to the University as tfack
coach. Several years later he assumed the task of coaching the freshman
football team and the year before last became freshman» basket ball coach.
His ‘new appointment comes in the nature of a promotfoni His freshman

 

forty and two of those were lost during an illness whichéconfinedz the coach
to bed for several weeks and the other two were Ibst oy one point. The
Penn State freshmen were defeated three times in four atte,mpts and all of
the best high and prep school teams in Western Pennsylvania have fallen
before the Kerr-coached freshmen teams. ~ "

Mr. Kerr has been a successful coach because he I-hows athletics and
because he knows how to handle men. Being a high school professor prob-
ably helps him in imparting his knowledge, for the men under him learn
quickly. Few men have taken hold of as many greenhcrns and made star
athletes out of them than has Coach Kerr. His knowledge of how to handle
men comes from his ability to command their respect and» to make them
work. 'He has. nofuse for aloafer or for a man who “can't stand the gaff.”
He drives his men and they respect him for E. If Coach Kerr does not
turn out some of the best basket ball teams in the history of the University,
‘there will be some bitter disappointments on the part of those who know
him well.

 

McMASTERS’ APPOINTMENT MEETS WITH APPROVA

Coach Kerr has set an awful mark for Dr, McMas.telrs to reach with
his next year's freshman floor team, but McMasters has countless boosters
whoibelieve ﬁrmly In? his ability. Dr. Mcmasters graduated from the
School of Dentistry in 1917 and is one of the most loyal Pittites that ever re-
ceived a diploma from this University, as well as being one of the finest
athletes. McMasters’ game was principally track and for a number of years
ranked as the greatest pole-vaulter in the history of the school. He held
the University pole-vault record in his day at 11 feet 6 inches-._ But he was
equally good on the basket ball floor, being a member ofqthe great ‘I911 that
won the Pennsylvania State championship, along with Hastings, Lubic, Mc-
Nulty and Maison, and it took a mighty classy man to win a berth on that
team and that McMasters was one of its stars speaks volumes. for his
basket ball ability. This ability is not confined to. playing the game, but
applies equally well to coaching it and Dr. McMas’cers has. the conﬁde-nce of
everyone that he will make _good as freshman coach next winter.‘
