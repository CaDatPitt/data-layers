Judiciary Commission Upholds
Suspension‘ of PiLam Football

Interfraternity Council’s Judiciary_ Commission has up-
held a ruling by the IF Athletic Committee declaring Pi
Lambda Phi ineligible for fraternity football competition for
the remainder of the fall semester.

The Commission’s decision followed an appeal by the

Pi Lams of a judgment handed down on Oct. 5 by the Ath- ’
letic Committee. The Committccé

had charged the fraternity with a
violation of the following rules:
Eligibility Rules and Regulations
(Section 3), “a team shall forfeit
any contest in which it uses an in-
eligible player,” Forfeits and Post-
ponements (Section 2), “One for-
feit in a sport automatically drops
a team from further competition
in that sport for the season.”

Pi Lambda Phi violated these
ru1es"by'using a player named
Leonard Schnitzer who is not on
the active list of the fraternity
and is not enrolled in the Uni-
versity. The infraction took place

on Oct. 3. .

In its appeal, Pi Lam fully ad-
mits the use of an ineligible
player in the game. The appeal
was supported by the contention
that the athletic rules were
changed on the evening of Oct.
3, at a meeting of the -IF Coun-
cil.

At the meeting the rules were
amended to read that “a team for-
feit be penalized by dropping that
team from that sport, but a tech-
nical forfeit, such as allowing an
illegal player to participate or
failure of a referee to show be
penalized by the addition of one
game to the loss column and a
subtraction of one game from the
win column.”

Pi Lam further agrees that
they should forfeit the game but
argued that they should be al-

   

in a game against Phi Epsilon Pi‘

lowed to continue in football
competition. The fraternity al-
so felt that because they did not
have a. member present at the
amendment meeting they did
not have any knowledge of a
change in the rules, or a chance
to protest the changes made.

The Judiciary Commission ruled
that “amendment to the, Athletic
Rules as passed by IF on the eve-
ning of Oct. 3 does not apply
since the amendment was passed
after the game.”

Also included in the decision
was the ruling that “the amend-
ment was not passed by estab-
lished procedure and therefore
could not be considered by the
Commission.” All initial legis-
lation and amendments to estab-
lished rules of the Athletic Com-
mittee must first be considered
by the Committee, sent to Leo
Bemis, director of intramural

. sports, and then considered by
IF Council. One or more of these
steps was overlooked by Coun-
cil when the amendment was
passed. .

Commission’s ruling further
held that the contention by the
Pi Lams that they were in ignor-
ance of the new rules was “dis-
qualiﬁed on the grounds that it
is the responsibility. of the fra-
ternity to become acquainted with
the rules of any activity in which
it wishes to participate.”

 

‘side is coupled with the situations

which arise throughout the course
of his stay with the family hosting
him.

Heading a cast which is one of
the largest assembled for a non-
musical dramatic production at
Pitt is Larry Heller, who was
last seen as Freddy Hill in
“Pygmalion.” The cast is as fol-
lows:

Mrs. Stanley, Jean Kelly; Miss
~Preen, Dona Ginsberg; June Stan-
ley, June Hopper; Sarah, Gail
Oller; Mrs. Dexter, Ethel Schac-
ter; Maggie, Mary Nina John-

hen; Harriet Stanley, Edith Wal-
dorf; Mr. Stanley, Richard Harsh-
berger; Dr. Bradley, Peter Beagle.

Heller; Bert Jefferson, Jack Joy;
Beverly Carlton, Bob Feldman;
Banjo, Paul Mooney; Lunch
Guests, Norm Bloom, O’Leary,

The play will run for three
days —- November 8, 9, and 10.

ers for one dollar. Season passes,
good for three more shows to be

Finds New Worlds To Conquer,

« weanesaay,- october 17," 1-95s'—'rm«: rm N1-:ws—rage 3

PhD Holder Setting Fast Pace Here

Like Alexander the Great,
an Alexander at Pitt conquer-
ed his world in his early
twenties. At the age of 24,
Tony (Thanis) Alexander .had
the distinction of being the

youngest man to receive 'a PhD
from the University of Pittsburgh.

Eight years earlier, this man of
intelligence and inspiration had
come to the United States to learn
our methods of trade. His father
and two brothers were in the ex-
porting business in Greece; and
the information he could bring
them would be of much value.

Two important events changed
his plans. While at the Univers-
ity of Tampa, he met and married
a girl from Pittsburgh, who per-
suaded him to study graduate
work at Pitt. In 1951, Tony Alex-
ander came to Pitt; and after two
years, he had earned both a Mast-
ers and a PhD Degree.

America A Challenge
By this time Dr. Alexander had

‘_decided to remain in Pittsburgh.

He found life in America a thrill-
ing challenge. Pitt to him was "an
institution that could be excelled
by no other. He says, “At Pitt, the
students receive a broad training
of the mind, giving them insight
on all aspects of life plus an edu-
cation enabling them to become
experts on a chosen ﬁelds.”
Dr. Alexander was such an

‘ outstanding student that he was

immediately offered a position
teaching economics and statis-
tics in the school of Business
Administration. He spent part of
his time in the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research and began work-
ing on research manuals. This
work was ﬁnanced by a grant
from the Zurn foundation.
Many companies haxe offered
to publish the manual in book
form. Also Dr. Alexander was
trusted with important data from
large industries in the Pittsburgh
area. His job was to prepare
questionnaires determining the
capital expenditures for these in-
dustries. Dr. Alexander’s latest
work is compiling a work book

for graduate students‘, from, case

Cl1ancellor'Litchfield Proposes

Broad New Academic Program

Last week during the Western Pennsylvania Education
Conference at Syria Mosque, Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
 “outlined his hopes for a broad new academié program to

 

make the University of Pittsburgh a world "leader.

Dr. Litchﬁeld’s four broad hopes are:
(1) A better balance between liberal arts and professional

training. He proposed a year-

round school of three semesters in

v which there would be no technical

training in any undergraduate
school. _
Tri-Terms Proposed

The technical .or professional
training would come in graduate
school. By going year-round, the
student could achieve this goal in
a reasonable time. ’

(2) Greater internal unity With-
in the university with closer con-

 tact between the students and the
‘faculty of the various schools.

Dr. Litchﬁeld would house
schools of related ﬁelds in the
same building and put libraries
together so students might more
clearly see the world outside
their own narrow interests.

(3) Regular analysis of what t_he
world needs from the university.
This would enable educators to
toss out some programs and set
up new ones as the times dictate.

Moral Development

(4) Make students “total human
beings” by taking more interest in
their moral and spiritual develop-
ment outside the classroom. This
would entail more “campus life”
at Pitt, such as the new Student
Union at the old Hotel Schenley.

To achieve all these broad
hopes, Dr. Litchﬁeld said Pitt

 will need outstanding facilities
in all its schools. It must in-
crease tuition in the future, re-
ceive “material” raises in State

     

aid, obtain 400 to 500 per cent
more endowments and higher
alumni giving.

He “described Pitt’s library sys-
tem as “deplorable” and the ath-
letic plant as “criminally small.”
Both programs are “musts,” he
declared. ,

Dr. Litchﬁeld also cited the
need for new dormitories, in ad-
dition to the former A Schenley
-Apartments, if the school is to at-
tract students from throughout
the World.

City, Thursday, Oct. 18, at 6 p.m. , ‘

Dr. Rogers, who is in Pittsburgh
to speak before the American So-

cuss with Mrs. Elkus the types of
engineers that are needed, the

kind of training they require, and ‘

related questions.

Dr. Rogers, who has put into 3
practice the idea of making use
of part-time teachers taken from
industry to relieve the enormous
shortage in outstanding science
teachers, is well known for his
idea: that “quality and faculty
far exceed campus buildings in,
achieving notable engineering
results in both teaching and
training ﬁelds.”

Polytechnic Institute of Brook-
lyn is the nation’s second largest
engineering school with more than
6,000 full and part—time under-
graduate and graduate students.

The graduate engineering school i

is numerically the largest, and

While working in the School of
Business Administration, he has
found “that our Business Admini-
stration department is highly‘re-
cognized by the government and
by large industries. We are trust-
ed with top secret facts and are
invited to attend all conferences

most in the country.”

Dr. Alexander spends his af-
ter-school hours on a personal
project. Last summer he hired
70 students, representing all the

school in the University. Work- A

ing with these students, he be-
gan a program for ‘the re-assess-
ment of‘Mer.cer County. This
entailed reappraising the value
of properties in Mercer County
to comply with the Pennsylva-
nia State Equalization Tax Law.
The county commissioners were
quite pleased with the results, and
they found it hard to believe that
college students could operate so
effectively without detailed train--
ing. “We have a high caliber of

received offers from Clearﬁeld

Publicity In Poltics

In regard to the coming elec-
tion, Dr. Alexander, who can cer;
tainly be considered an expert,
has expressed his feelings about
the parties’ attitudes toward busi-
ness. “I think that an unnecessary
commotion is being made for pub-
licity purposes.” He said, “Neither
big business nor small business

the election. The economic factors
are the ones that must be con-
sidered; and neither party can
control these.” ‘ ‘

Dr. Alexander is proud to be
a part of Pitt, ﬁrst as a student
and then as a teacher. He believes
that “the mere acquisition of a
PhD degree does not qualify one
to become an instructor. We must
not overlook. the difference be-
tween acquiring and transmitting
knowledge. A teacher must be

‘lfeligian Year Round   "

The Student Council of Religious Organizations met
during a retreat several weekends ago and attempted to
decide at that meeting whether or not Religion-in-Life Week
should continue in its present form. The decision was that
it should not. The Council, in making its decision, had three
alternatives from which to choose. They were: (.1) A con-
tinuation of the former practice of setting aside one week
out of the year as a Religion—in—Life Week which would

involve obtaining a convocation speaker as well as speak-B
« ers for classrooms, ﬁresides, fraternities, sororities, and other

organizations; (2) A year—long program with no, speciﬁc em-
phasis on one week; (3) Or’, a combination of the ﬁrst two
ideas. - ’

J The consensus of the 30 members was that the third al-
ternative should be accepted. This means that a,year-long
program will be put into effect with the possibility of bring-
ing in a speaker to address the entire University some week
in the spring.

Council members went a step further and suggested

J plans as tohow the year—round program could be handled.

No decisions have been reached as yet but several ideas
are under consideration. It has been’ mentioned that a
series of programs be held which would explore the reli-
gious implications. in art, music, drama, and politics, as
well as a program titled the Skeptic’s Hou.r, the purpose

being to stimulate thought. concerning the meaning and

purpose of life from the point of View of the thoughtful
and concerned Student. t

Other ideas, suggestedwere seminars on the subject of
Human Relations, a program for freshmen, and a deﬁnitive
publication concerning religion on campus.

Each one of the new ideas sounds strong in view'of
the Council’s objective of developing a student’s spiritual
growth. It shall be interesting to see how far they are

of the scientiﬁc variety.

There's Still A Delmlancl. ...~ .

Liberal Arts Maior

By Gordon Clowney .

In today’s world of rapid scientiﬁc and tech
nological change, and complexity of business and
industry, specialization seems to have become the
key for college graduates seeking jobs.

Engineers, scientists, and business students seem
to have a corner on the high paying jobs offered
to college seniors. The struggle for technological
superiority between ‘the United
States and Russia has done -much
to heighten this demand for col.
lege trained specialists, especially

 

A news item released last week
by the University’s School of En-
gineering shows that engineers
account for 28 per cent of the
student body
here at Pitt. Add to this the fact V - --
that littlemore than a third of the applicants for
admission were accepted, and one can readily see
that»today’s high school student is very much aware
of the large demand for engineering graduates.

But while this specialization does offer the in-
dividual a rather lucrative starting salary, does it
enable him to take his place in the modern world,
capable of understanding and appreciating those
things that don’t happen to fall into his own lim-
ited ﬁeld of study. Does it allow him to 100k be-
yond his area of concentration, to understand and
evaluate problems in another ﬁeld, or to intelli-
gently discuss affairs in which he has not had in-
tensive training? —

Takingthe matter from a still more practical
standpoint, how can an employee hope to advance
in his job, if he can’t communicatethis ideas, plans,
recommendations, etc., to ‘his employer. Even if the
individual is an expert in his particular line, of

- work, his ability, or inability to organize and ex-

press ideas in writing and in speaking, will be a
large factor in‘ whether or not he rises to a high
level executive position, or is buried in the struggle
for advancement.

Communication Important ,

In an article on “How To Be An Employee,” by
Peter F. Drucker, Mr. Drucker points out that “as
an employee you work with and through other
people. This means that your success as an em-
ployee will depend on yourability to communicate
with people and to present your own thoughts and
ideas to them so they will both understand what

you are driving at and be persuaded. The letter,

the report or memorandum, the ten-minute spoken
“presentation” to a committee are basic tools of
the employee.”

This is not to say that everyone trained in a
special ﬁeld is not able to communicate effective-
ly. But the majority, due to the emphasis placed
on mastering and becoming proﬁcient in one area,
have not had the opportunity to learn much else.

But while his training has not been diversiﬁed,
the average specialist can command a very hand-
some starting salary. However, is the ‘starting
salary always indicative as to what the individual
will be earning ﬁve or ten years later? It is in
this matter of ‘advancement that the liberal arts
major seems to have the advantage over his more
skilled brethren. ' i '

Starting with a somewhat lower salary, but with

Natures and Tribal Dances . . .

   

a broader and more general education, the liberal
art student, in most cases, must receive much of
his specialized knowledge in “on the job training.”
But once he becomes familiar with the particulars
of his job, his liberal education supplies him with
the tools to advance at a pretty steady rate.
Quoting again from Mr. Drucker’s article. “There
are a great many careers in which the increasing
emphasis is on specialization. You ﬁnd these careers
in engineering and in accounting, in production,iin
statistical work, and in teaching. But, there is an
increasing demand for people who are able to take
in a great area at a glance, peope who perhaps

, do not know too_much about any one ﬁeld, though

one should always have cne area of real compe-
tence. These “generalists” are particularly needed
for administrative positions, where it is their job
to see that other people do the work, where they

have to plan for other people, organize their work, 

Y

initiate it and appraise it.
Outlook Promising . .

From a recent issue of “Fortune Magazine,”
one of the leading periodicals on business and in-
dustry, comes the following view, shared by more
and more members of top management today. “Men
of general education in business or the liberal arts
actually have .a promising outlook: if past trends
continue, the typical non-specialist will be earning
more after ﬁve to ten years.than the typical spe-
cialist.” ~ ' ' -

“But initially the non-specialist is less sought
after. He does have a marketable ability, the abili-

ty to deal with a variety of new problems and new  
situations, but it may be that neither he nor the ‘Q.

company will put a ﬁnger on that ability when he‘
has just turned" twenty-one.”

The personnel head of Proctor and Gamble
states that, “more and more we are turning to the
liberal arts graduate. Our interest is in‘ what the
man is, not what he has studied. We want toknow
whether he is a potential leader.” I

Dr. Robert Wilson, chairman of Standard Oil
(Indiana) sees a need for “men with a broad edu-
cational background with or without the capstone

[of specialization.” Clarence Randall,‘Chairman of

Inland Steel, says that “for the perpetuation of
management in corporate life we require men

/trained in the creative and imaginative qualities

that come from a general education.”
Combination Good ‘~g
However, if narrow specialization is bad, then
an education that is too broad or diversiﬁed is just
as bad. Actually, what present day industry is
looking for, above all else, is what is known as
the “well rounded specialist.” This individual, and
not too many of them are to be found", combines
the good qualities~of both the specialist-and the
generalist. He is proﬁcient in performing the

speciﬁc job, and at the same time is capable of _

getting along with and handling people effectively.

The universities capable of turning out stu-
dents who pretty well ﬁt this “well rounded spe-
cialist” pattern, are the ones which will most
nearly be thought of as fulﬁlling their job to the
individual student, and to society in general.

But, even if you don’t happenlto be one 
these well rounded specialists, cheer up, the job

outlook for all of_ us seems to be pretty promising a 

these days. i

Gourmets Meet to Eat, Discuss

Cooking ofPeas Without Water

By FITZHUGH

SCHENLEY

(Editor’s Note: Fitzhugh Schenley, junior reporter for the defunct
OMNIBUS, paused ‘at the PITT NEWS oﬁice during airecent tour
of the Oakland fleshpots. Taking a stance before an 1890 model
Smith-Corona—Chancellor please note—, he pounded out a report
on the latest meeting of Pitt’s new secret: society, Gourmets

Anonymous.)

How to cook garden peas without water was the prin-

cipal subject discussed at the GA Society meeting at an un-
 gnamed rendezvous on an unspeciﬁed day last week.

The society changed direction;

so to speak, by descending to a
below—street-level restaurant to
sample a perfect meal prepared
by a chef honored for the evening.
Heretofore the group has always
found second—floor hideouts for
their meetings.

“Let’s construct this m e al
around a ﬁne piece of beef,” sug-
gested the_sole sophomore in the
society. Preliminary arrangements
were made to explore the possibi-
lities of a perfect dinner centered
on a perfect ﬁllet mignon.

Salmon Chosen

‘ After some consideration, smok-
ed salmon was chosen for the ap-
pétiser. Paper-thin slices of the
cured ﬁsh, lox to some members
of the group, were served with
chopped black olives.

A short debate ensued on the
subject of howrare the steaks
should be. The members had re-
cently dined in a restaurant which
»printed on its menu, “The Man-
agement. refuses to assume re-
sponsibility if a customer orders
our tender, succulent steaks cook-
ed well-done.” Having taken this
statement as policy on steaks, the
members now, with one accord,
cried, “Rare!” thereby earning the
profound respect of the chef.
Two vegetables were ordered
after some thought. Past experi-

ience had taught the value of '
-,3-r'the lowly baked potato when

properly served with .freshly
soured cream. The chef, enter-
ing into the spirit of the occa-
sion added a few chopped chives

...\

to the cream. Garden peas, fresh
from the South, were served as
a green vegetable.

Follow the French

The subject of peas concerned
the diners. The chef was asked to
follow an old French recipe for
cooking this tender legume. He
placed several large lettuce leaves
and a ball of butterthe size of a
walnut in a heavy sauce pan
which he then sealed. The mois-
ture from the lettuce leaves and
from the peas themselves pro-
vided the exact flavor needed for
this delightful vegetable.

Desert, as usual with GA, was
simple and uncomplicated. In
matters of food,” said one mem-
ber, “the simple things are best.”
Unanimously the group ordered
plain vanilla ice cream, over
which was poured Napoleon
brandy. Black coffee completed
the meal.

After recording the activities of
the society in the journal, the club
informed the press of their deli-
berations, and elected one of the
student members to serve as host
at his home at an early date.

not only a means of examining
life, but also_a means of escape
from it.

Then, after one of the gaps,
he said, “Practically all people
are lonely as hell . . . I feel a
great" deal of sympathy for the
villain.” He writes because he
has to. Unlike many writers who
work at regular hours, Beagle
responds to “occasional tre-
mendous urges.” He ﬁnds it not
unusual to be smitten as his
mind- moves ahead and away
from the boring formalism of
classroom learning.

His formula for writing is sim-
ple enough. For Peter, the urge to
write is always coupled with a
specic character. Writing consists
in deﬁning his relationship to the
character. All the time he is writ-‘
ing, he asks himself the question,
“Wouldn’t it be funny if . . . ?"

The questions won’t be answer— -

ed. Especially the one about where
Petertthe recorder ends and Peter
the inventor‘ begins. Peter wrote
a poem once, he says, about his
uncle Smedley who shrinks heads.

Varsity Cagers

' Begin Sessions

Coach Bob Timmons greeted 21
candidates to the ﬁrst drills as
the varsity basketball team began
practice last Monday at the Field
House.

The ﬁrst day was spent in drill-
ing on fundamentals and rounding
the players into condition; the
ﬁrst hour was spent in practicing
shooting and passing while de-
fensive drills took up most of the
second hour. ’

Almost all of 1astayear’s letter
winners are back. The rest of the
lettermen, being football players,
will begin practice after the foot-
ball season is over.

Co-captain Bob Lazor has “la
severely sprained ankle and has

‘been hobbling around with the

help, of a cane. He sat in the
stands during the practice and
will not‘ dress for a while.

  
   

support.

Vince Scorsone and Dan Wis-
niewski lay claim to the guard
slots.’ Scorsone, undoubtedly one
of the most underrated players
on the team, has .—been playing
like an All-American in the past
three games on both defense and
offense.

Due to injuries at the guard
positions, Scorsone and Wisniewski

V have been forced to play most of

the game. To relieve this burden,

:Ron Kissel has been transferred

to guard from tackle to team up
with Nick Carr reporting from the
disabled list.

Starting QB'Tossup

Chuck Brueckman will start at
center with Tom Salwocki ﬁlling
in as a replacement. '

Starting quarterback is still a
tossup until game time with either
Darrell Lewis or Corny Salvaterra
handling the pigskin.

Coach Michelosen, still unde-
cided about the starting back-
ﬁeld, is going with Jim Theo-
dore and Corky Cost at the halfs
and Tom Jenkins at fullback.
Ray Di Pasquale, Nick Pas-
sodelis, and Ralph Jelic have
been alternating with the ﬁrst
group.

The Panthers, specializing in
power plays, have outgained the
opposition to date in rushing by
470 yards to 454 yards. The pass-
ing game of the Blue and Gold,
though, has been held to a mini-
mum, gaining only 115 yards to
366 yards for the opposition.

Panther Cubs
Seek First Win

Freshman coach Steve
Petro, is probably the only
grid‘ mentor in the country
who was happy with a loss
sustained by his squad last
Saturday. C

The Panther Cubs were edged
out by the West Virginia Frosh,
19-14, at Clarksburg, but Petro is
not complaining.

_ “Sure, we would have liked to
win,” he said, “but I was Dleas- _
antly surprised by the playing
of the fellows. I was expecting
a much worse defeat.”

Petrol pointed out that the
Mountaineers have been working
out with the varsity since Sept. 1,
while the Blue and Gold freshmen
have had only three weeks prac-
tice. Besides the Panthers were
without the services of tackles
Ron Dzanony and Ernie Westwood
for much of the game.

“The rest of the line made up
for the deﬁcit, though,” Petro ex-
plained. “I was pleased with the
play of our centers, Seraﬁno Fa-
zio and Bob Rathi as linebackers,
and Bob Longfellow and Al Cor-
ﬁeld at guard. Larry Burke and a
converted center, Chuck Mar-
ranka, did good jobs ﬁlling in at
tackle. Dave Helsel also impressed
me at theend.”

Saturday the Junior Cougars
take on the Penn State Frosh at
the" Stadium at 2 p.m. Petro is
hoping to make use of George
Valesky, halfback from Jean-
nette. Valesky was injured dur-
ing the West Virginia game but
with luck will ‘see action Satur-
day. Steve said “His loss will
certainly hamper us, and I know
he can help us if he plays.”

The Petromen will be looking
for their ﬁrst win in two seasons,
having ﬁnished with a record of
two ties and two losses last year.

Harriers Run American _Univ.,
Georgetown in Triangular Meet

By MICHAEL GERBER

On Saturday afternoon, Coach Carl Olson’s undefeated.
cross—country team resumes action after a two week layoff.
Due to scheduling difficulties, there was no meet last week
and the Panthers are fresh from a victory over Villanova
and Navy in the triangular meet at Annapolis Oct. 6.

This coming Saturday will find the Panthers in the na-
tion’s capital where they will run:
against Georgetown University and

American University in another
triangular meet.

American University Weak. ,,,
After Littemeier, however, th _
Hoyas do not have too much 

the ﬁrst of two important meets they have this week. To-
day, Leo Bemisi booters play at Grove City and Saturday
they will travel to Brockport, N. Y., to battle last year’s
NCAA co-champions, the Brockport State Teachers College

A
T

eleven.

The Blue and Gold have had
more than a week to recuperate
from the minor injuries sustained
in their ﬁrst ’ " ' "" "
pair of meets
a n d s h o u l d
have an even
chance to im-
prove their rec-
ord of one win
and one tie.

However, at
1 e a s t o n e
player w i 1 l
m is s today’s
e n g agement.
Jack H i l l ,
outstanding senior right half-
back, 'was hurt in last Friday’s
scrimmage and will be replaced
by another senior, Dennis Neu-
man. Neuman himself suffered a
bruised thigh in the opener at
Slippery Rock, but is now fully
recovered.

One other lineup change has
been made for the Grove City
scrap. Jack Horox, who perform-
ed so brilliantly in the Panther
win over Lock Haven, is the new
left man, replacing Al Solomon.

Ordinarily, the locals could ex-
pect a fairly easy win over Grove
City—-but on their home ﬁeld the
Grovers_ are very tough. Still, the
locals are given a slight edge.

    

Bemis

These two teams -have met

three times» before in the last
two years .with the Panthers
winning one. Grove City lost
only two members from last
season’s team, and included in
the veterans is Bob Subbroco
who was personally responsible
for those two Grove City vic-
tories. ~

Offensively, the Crimson are
primarily a passing team with
hustle to spare; and on defense
their main asset is agressiveness.

Bemis is counting on a win to-
day, but Saturday could be a dif-
ferent story. “If we play as well
today as we did against Lock
Haven, we should win. But a vic-
tory Saturday would be strictly
an upset.”

The Brockport team is no
weaker this year than in 1955
when the booters from upper
New York state, along with
Penn State, had one of the two
best squads in the country.
Coach Huntley Parker has 14
seniors, 13 juniors, and only two
sophomores on his outstanding
team.

In referring to a few defensive
failures in the Lock Haven meet,
Bemis commented, “If we give
Brockport as many scoring
chances as we gave Lock Haven,
it would take a superman effort

Lto beat them.”

These two schools, however, do
not ﬁgure _to provide the Panther
harriers with as tough a test as
Villanova. Georgetown, in its
opening meet of the season last
Saturday, ﬁnished. third behind
Villanova and St. Josephs of Phila-
delphia in a triangular meet.

Littemeir Tops Hoyas

The Hoyas are not their usual
strong selves this year, and their
cross-country’ chances for
coming season do not appear to
be too bright.

Coached by Elmer “Hap”
Hardell, a veteran cross-coun-
try mentor, the Georgetown
harriers are led by captain Bob
Littemeier.

Littemeier,. a senior, was the
IC4A freshman cross-country
champion in 1953. Since that
time, Littemeier has done very
well and will undoubtedly be a
threat in this year’s IC4A compe-
tition. 1

the '

There are six other harriers who
will run against _the Panthers.
They are juniors Tom Mackey,
Bob Carney, Don Nelson, and Tom
Basick and sophomores Ralph
Coan and Norman Williams.
American University is a.
small school which has a woe-.
fully weak cross-country team
and does not ﬁgure to be any
competition at all for either
Georgetown or Pitt. . -

workouts in order to prevent their .

d:l‘alented Blue Devils
Not Philanthropists

By AL PELAEZ
At the main entrance to Duke University is a huge statue
of Washington Duke——its main benefactor—with a single
word inscribed on it——PHlLANTHROPlST. Panther Coach
John Michelosen isn’t expecting the talented Blue Devils to
be in a philanthropic mood this Saturday afternoon, how-

A

ever. V

Duke, rated as one of the na-
- tions top teams in most pre-
‘ season polls, has dropped two of
its ﬁrst four games——7.-0 to South
Carolina and 33-20 to powerful
Tennessee. In between these
losses they sandwiched a 40-7
av-auzyictory over an outclassed Vir-
‘ ginia eleven and an upset 14-6
_,__ .. conquest of Southern Methodist.
.a The deceiving aspect of this re-
cord. is Sonny Jurgensen, rated
“the best quarterback in the
business” by his coach, Bill Mur-
ray. Jurgensen was injured in the
Blue Devi1’s second game and did
vnot get into action until late in
the SMU contest——but not too late
. to lead the Dukes to two touch-
downs and a victory. This Satur-
day Jurgensen is expected to be
in top form and “is anxious to

get another crack against Pitt.”
Duke Inexperienced

Supporting Jurgensen will be
the biggest —— but also the most
inexperienced —- team Duke has
ﬁelded since 1951. The end posi-
tions will be manned "by Bill
Thompson and Captain Buddy
Bass. Both are former right ends,
but Thompson has been shifted to
the opposite side of the line. Be-
hind these two -— who are rated
among the best receivers in the
Atlantic Coast Conference — are
a host of inexperienced sopho-
mores.

Returning regular, Sid De-
lotach and Dan Cox, a newcom-
er to the varsity, will hold down
the tackle slots with Roy Hord
and Charley Klinger starting at
the guards.

Spearheaded upset win over SMU

Frosh Cagers ‘Begin Practice;
They’re Tall And Enthusiastic

By MIKE KOSCHIK
Approximately 40 boys appeared in the dusty old gym
under the Stadium last Monday as freshman basketball prac-

tice got under way.

Most of the boys‘dressed as soon as they arrived and

"‘'‘began shooting until Coach Carl: ’

Peterson and his assistant, John
Horty, made their appearance.
Mr. Peterson’s ﬁrst move was
to gather the candidates around
him and give them a short talk.
He then led the boys through
some .. calisthenics which soon
had most of them gasping.

The coach then showed them
some fundamentals and the boys
ran through the drills until prac-
tice ended at six o’clock.

When asked about his impres-
sions of the first practice Coach
Peterson said, “I’m happy at the
number of boys who turned out.
Their enthusiasm was great.
Every one of them showed a de-
sire to work and that's just what
they will have to do to make the

. team.” \

 Peterson added that he was
pleased with the height of many
of the 'candidates. He also ex-

boys out for the team. “Nobody
has made any position yet and
I-won’t pick the,ﬁrst team for
at least two weeks.”

Assistant coach Horty agreed
with Coach Peterson’s statements
and added that he was glad to see
that the boys were “ready, will-
ing and able.”

Although Coach Peterson de-
clined to single out any player as
outstanding, probably some of the
better candidates are John Man-'
dish, 6-3 forward; Gene Massari,
6-1 guard; John Mills, 6-5 center;
and Eliot Maravich, 6-5 forward.

positions were lost via graduation
and this could prove to be a weak
spot in the Blue Devil line. An-
other” question mark is center,
held down by the inexperienced
—- but big — Johnny Long.

McElhaney Always Gains

The halfbacks have been term-
ed “plentiful but questionable” by
Coach Murray. Emerging as the
best of a mediocre group are Nick
Kredick and Skitch Rudy. Close
behind these two, however, is
Bunny Blaney, a 159 pound scat-
back’who is averaging over six
yards a carry.

Fullback Harold McEllhaney—
from nearby Burgettstown, Pa. —
has caught the fancy of the Dixie
fans with/his’ powerful, slashing
running. In his two years on the
Duke varsity he has never been
stopped for a loss.

Although this Saturday’s game
is built as a Shriner’s beneﬁt,
Duke doesn’t intend to give the
game to Pitt. They ﬁgure that
one philanthropist on the campus
is enough. '

F umbling Swamis
Wondering Again;
Salvaterra Picks

Fumbling for about 20 min-
utes before they decided on

which crystal ball they would i

use for this week’s guessing ses-
sions, the PITT NEWS Swamis
ﬁnally agreed and once again
lend their wondering selections
to all -— concerned or uncon-
cerned. -

Wondering (or is it wander-
ing) into the fold this week to
represent the players is quar-
terback Corny Salvaterra, a
passer (I think) from the foot-
ball squad. Corny just did the
natural by pickin’ all winrgrs
and no ties.

Representing the coaching
staff is the illustrious Walt
Cummins who also had the good
fortune to be present at the
most unusual seance of the sea-
son. 'Said Walt, “I have my

Sorority Activities
Start Formal Rush

(Continued from page 1)

Sunday, rushees will have an
opportunity to get the “inside,
story” of the sorority of their
choice.

Each girl may attend two par-
ties only if she has received an
invitation. If she cannot attend,
she must decline the invitation
beforehand. If she has accepted
an invitation, she must notify the
sorority with a written note of
acceptance.

If a rushee has attended these
parties she must come to the
twelfth floor Cl., Monday, Oct. 22
between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. to ﬁll
out a preferential ballot, whether
or n t she has decided that she
wants to pledge.

The evening, between 7 and
7:15 p.m., the rushees should re-
turn to the twelfth ‘ﬂoor to pick
up their bids. They will then
proceed to the sorority houses
for the ribbon ceremony.

A bid consists of a formal in-
vitation to join a sorority and an
invitation to attend a ribbon cere-
mony which is the ﬁrst meeting
of the sorority with the pledges.

Approximately 200 invitations
have been sent out to second sem-
ester freshmen and upper-class
women who have completed at
least one half semester at Pitt,
with a QPA of 1.0 and carrying
at least twelve credits.

Any woman, meeting these
qualiﬁcations who has not been
invited to rush- a sorority, and
would like to, may do so by con-
tacting Miss Skewis, assistant to
the dean of women, in the dean
of women’s office on the twelfth
