The search goes on...

Campus
presents
wish Iisi

By Nicole_Walz
Staff Writer

The chancellor search committee mem-
bers sat at the front of the William Pitt
Union Ballroom yesterday, and their view
was desolate.’ Rows of empty chairs
stretched before them, along with about 25
people there to voice their opinions about
who should become Pitt’s new chancellor.

An invitation was extended to the campus
community to attend the ‘open meeting, but
not many people responded. Of the people
who were there, each had _a different wish
list for the new chancellor.

“Pitt is fast becoming a cultural waste-
land,” said W. Stephen Coleman, the chair
of the theatre arts department. “We are the
state-supported -institution of Western
Pennsylvania. We have an obligation to pro-
vide a well-rounded education.” ,

Some speakers criticized former
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor, while oth-
ers described the ideal chancellor of the
future. » _ , j _,

“We need someone who will be open to
speak to faculty, staff and students,” said
John Baker of the School of Dental
Medicine. “Dr. O’Connor wouldn’t meet
with our group, and that’s why we met with
the provost.” -

Roger Campbell, a renaissance studies
major, said of the former chancellor,
“O’Connor whined that he hadn’t been told
what to do. A chief executive ofﬁcer is not
someone who has to be told what to do.”

People suggested each candidate should
submit a mission statement. This would
allow the Search committee to gain insight
into the candidates’ plans for Pitt

“If you find [a mission statement] that has
any depth to it, pay close attention to who
wrote it,” said Robert Hazo, director of the
American Experience Program.

One staff member hopes the new chancel-
lor will be more inclusive to staff concerns.

“Many staff members feel like third-rate
citizens,” said Marie Capezzuto, a staff
member from Housing Services. “We have
no real mechanism for grievance, and per-

Fewer people join the Greeks

By Vicky Palombizio
For The Pitt News

lt’s that time of year again. Everywhere
you look you’re reminded to RUSH!
RUSH! RUSH!

The Greeks returned to their usual fall
ritual during the past few weeks to pro-
mote recruitments. They posted signs all
over campus, set up tables in the Towers
Lobby and held meetings and get-togeth-
ers.

But something different happened this
year.

While the Greeks made a lot of noise,
the response they got was much quieter.

As fall-semester rush officially ended
for sororities last night, the number of
pledges came in at 217, while last year’s

numbers exceeded 300.

Many people have different explanations
for the declining interest toward Greek
life, but all agree that it has declined to a
degree.

V Some say the bad publicity surrounding
sexual assault charges had something to do
with it. Last year, a 19-year-old Pitt stu-
dent claimed that several men had assault-
ed her at a combine party at the Phi
Gamma Delta (FIJI) house. Sigma Chi,
Delta Tau Delta and FIJI were put on
social probation for their involvment in the
party, which included underage drinking.

But others say that not as many students
felt the need to join the Greek system on
such an urban campus, or simply that
Greek life just didn’t appeal to this semes-

Groups plan strategy For student housing

By Melissa Pearlman -
For The Pitt News

As the one-year anniversary of the
university’s unveiling of the Master
Space Plan approaches, few changes
have yet to be seen.

For nearly a year now, Pitt has been
discussing the plan, which has the goal
of turning Pitt into an efficient and
viable campus of the future. It divides
construction projects into short-range,
mid-range and long-range goals -
roughly five-, 10- and 20-year ranges.

But the lack of housing provided by
Pitt is a problem that Oakland communi-
ty residents say they feel the plan
doesn’t address. There are approximate-

ly 2,200 students for whom the universi-
ty does not provide housing.

The university “really does not address
student housing,” said Susan Golomb,
executive director of the Oakland
Planning and Development Corporation.

In the plan, the issue of housing is pre-
sented as a short-range goal that will be
addressed within the next five years.

Local groups like the Oakland
Neighborhood Alliance and the Oakland
Planning and Development Corporation
have gotten together to try to propose an
alternative solution to the housing prob-
lem in Oakland.

According to these organizations, the
lack of university housing has forced
students to move off campus to areas in

North and South Oakland. They feel that
the neighborhood is forcing permanent
residents out to make room for slum-
lords and low property managed hous-
ing. These organizations represent busi-
nesses and residents that want to clean
up and revitalize Oakland.

Golomb, along with others. has
formed the Oakland Agreement
Committee, which is made up of 10
local organizations that are trying to
work with the city and the university to
see which areas of Oakland are most
appropriate for new student housing.

The Oakland Agreement Committee's
main purpose is not only to propose an
alternative housing plan for graduate and

Bosnia, Croatia step closer to peace

World Events

CROATIA — Leaders of the
Bosnian and Croatian govem—
ments announced yesterday that
they would not take advantage
of their position by attacking the
Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka, the chief American
envoy in the Balkans said.

If both governments honor the
pledge, it could be another step
toward achieving peace efforts
in Bosnia, a process which has
progressed recently.

If an attack does occur, it will
diminish Bosnian Serb hopes for
an autonomous republic in any
peace settlement and might even
draw Serbia into the conﬂict. --

KENYA — Pope John Paul II
addressed more than 300,000
people at a mass in Nairobi’s
largest park yesterday, calling
for an end to the bloodshed in
Rwanda and Burundi, saying
forgiveness and reconciliation
are the only workable solutions.

His words hit home, as the
massacres in Rwanda and
Burundi have devastated the
Roman Catholic Church in East
Africa and have deepened fears
that similar ethnic battles could
happen in Kenya.

In his speech, the pope made
no mention of the criticism of
the Catholic Church in Rwanda

during the genocide in that coun-
try last year. — The New York
Times

JAPAN — The alleged rape this
month of a Japanese school girl
by three American servicemen
in Okinawa has caused fury in
Japan, bringing demands to
revise rules considered lenient
when it comes to the American
military.

~ Hoping to alleviate the uproar.
Ambassador Walter Mondale
and Lt. Gen. Richard Myers, the
commander of U.S. forces in
Japan, apologized to the
Okinawan governor yesterday at
a .news conference, where the
American representatives called
the incident “an outrageous act
toward humanity.”

Ironically, the news confer-
ence was held in an American
military hotel in Tokyo where
top military officials for both
countries had gathered to cele-
brate a previously scheduled
“friendship dinner,” marking 50
years of military cooperation
since the end of World War II.

Applicants for fellowship may liaveJli<—-2-‘cl, study says

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

One applicant reported having
three articles published in a
medical journal.

Another cited six articles in
various scientiﬁc publications.

A third claimed to have been
published in professional jour-
nals 24 times.

There’s only one problem..

None of these journals exist.

Two researchers at the
University of Pittsburgh School
of'Medicine have found as
many as 20 percent of the appli-
cants for a highly competitive
training fellowship may have
lied about their research creden-
tials.

Also, 30 percent of the appli-
cants who reported publishing
articles in professional journals
misrepresented their accom-
plishments. These include
claiming to have published
nonexistent articles in actual
journals and citing articles in
non-exsisting journals.

“We were kind of depressed
when we were doing this,” said
Gail Sekas, a clinical assistant
professor in the Department of
Medicine and co-author of the
report. “We thought people were
more honest.”

The study, published in the
July 1 issue of Annals of
Internal Medicine, was conduct-
ed by Sekas and William R.
Hutson, also of the department
of medicine. It consisted of a
retrospective analysis of the 236
applications submitted for a gas-
troenterology fellowship at Pitt.

During the initial review of
applications to the fellowship
program, Sekas and Hutson dis-
covered that two applicants had
misrepresented research experi-
ence and publishing activities.

The first applicant claimed to
have published several papers
on diverse subjects during the
first two years of postgraduate
training. The unusually high
amount of productivity brought
this application to Sekas’ atten-
tion.

“This individual seemed a bit
too productive for someone so
early in their career,” Sekas said.

The second applicant immedi-
ately raised the suspicions of the
research team by reporting the

publication of a paper about a

’ basic science topic in a purely _

clinical journal.

‘_‘This applicant claimed to
have a highly scientific report
published in a journal which
usually only contains things like
pictures of ulcers,” Sekas said.

‘\ Both applicants were rejected.

After detecting these cases,
Sekasand Hutson reviewed all
of the fellowship applications
to determine how widespread
the misrepresntation had
become.

“Once we started looking, we
realized there were major prob-
lems,’’ Sekas said.

They discovered approxi-
mately 30 percent of the appli-
cants who included academic

accomplishments either embe1l- A

ished or simply invented them.
Some of the applicants were

particularly creative. In addition
to making up journals, one
applicant actually created co-
authors.

The researchers said the prob-
ability of detecting misrepre-
sented accomplishments is
small, and perhaps the appli-
cants felt the beneﬁts of entering

the fellowship program out-
weighed the low risk of being
exposed.

Acceptance into the gastroen-
terology fellowship program
essentially guarantees entry into
a subspecialty that has a higher
median income than other mate-
rial subspecialties, researchers

said. In a recent year, the aver-

According to the researchers,
the perception may exist that it
is normal to inflate one’s
achievements on applications
and that this does not constitute
an ethical problem.

turnout.”

She also said staff members
have had a pay freeze for the
past year, and that it could pos-
sibly extend into two years.

Although there were very
few students in attendance, they
did speak up.

“We would love someone
who is trustworthy,” said Tanita
Harris, chair of the Black
Action Society. “We would
love someone who is honest.”

“We need a humanist and a
teacher and scholar, not an edu-
cational bureaucrat,” Campbell
said. “We don’t need another
witty, charming, good—looking
guy who drops the right buzz-
words.”

Some speakers said the com-
mittee doesn’t need to look out-
side Pitt for thechancellor.

Capezzuto said of interim
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
“Perhaps we do have the right
man in the position now  we
need integrity. The internal sys-
tem will never improve unless
we have integrity.”

“I don’t think we can expect
someone to walk on water,”
said Arden Melzer, a professor
from the School of Social
Work. “I don’t think we can
expect a savior. We need under-
standing of the committee that
the university culture is differ-
ent from a corporate culture.
The CEO role is inappropriate.”

also to “return existing hous-
ing stock to buyers and home

owners,” Golomb said.

Jim DeAngelis, co—chair-
man of the Plant Utilization
and Planning Committee, is
working with the university
on the space plan, including
the comprehensive housing
strategy.

“The community has taken
an active role along with the
university concerning hous-
ing,” DeAngelis said.

Community members hope
to use an upcoming meeting
to continue to mold housing
strategy.

On Sept.’ 30, representa-
tives from the university,
local community groups and
Mayor Murphy will gather at
the School for the ‘Blind to
discuss rebuilding and
restructuring a community
that many feel is deteriorat-
ing.

“We feel that this is a real
opportunity for community
groups, residents and the uni-
versity to work together for
the revitalization of Oakland,
something that would be to
everyone’s benefit,” Golomb
said.

Clockers

A Spike Lee joint

Starring: Harvey Keitel, John Turturro,
Delroy Lindo, Mekhi Phifer

If you are under the assumption that-
Spike Lee’s Clockers is just another
mindless, bloody, gangsta flick in
which Han/ey Keitel yet again portrays

‘a tough guy who’s good with a gun,

you’re only half wrong. Keitel does play
the classic, cynical, no-nonsense cop-
with-a-mission, but in Clockers we
come to believe that he actually cares
about that mission.

Strike (Mekhi Phifer) is a drug deal-.
er, or clocker, who’, like‘ anyone living
in the projects, wants out. So, by clock-
ing for thelocal scumlord (Delroy
Lindo), he saves up his cash in the
hopes of getting the first train out of the
ghetto. This idea of escaping on a train
becomes not only a recurring symbol,
but also a subtle motivator for the char-
acters’ troubled existences. Countering
Strike’s “evil” line of work is his brother,
Victor, who works two honest jobs,
supports a family and is slowly going
insane under the pressure.

Cut to the painfully realistic crime
scene of a murder that the audience
does not actually witness but is fairly
certain of who’s responsible. The
NYPD is prepared to chalk the murder
up to a case of wrong place/wrong
time until an unexpected confession
from seemingly angelic Victor moti-
vates homicide detective Rocco Klein
(Keitel) to do some real investigating.

Sound simple? It isn’t. The real
depth of the film is conveyed through
the psychological aspects of several

DREAMS

 

Harvey Keitel, Mekhi Phifer and John Turturro star in Spike Lee's latest joint,’ Clockers.

beautifully intertwined relationships.
Under Lee's direction, the actors do a
convincing job of showing a strict code
of honor and a raw nobility in a setting
where one ‘wouldn't expect to find
either. it is this nobility that makes
Clockers different from so many other
movies (i.e. New Jack City and Tales
From the Hood) dealing with drugs.
What’s interesting is that this is the first
film of Spike. Lee's in which drugs
become a main focus. The stay—away-
from-drugs message is clear and

relentless without being didactic.

As with any realistic, well-made
movie about the drug scene in urban
hell, Clockers is somewhat brutal to
watch. Thankfully, the violence isn’t
without purpose, and the violence
helps to drive home the points -the film
makes. Spike Lee sets the tone by
using several pictures showing the
remains of murder victims which look
like crime scene photos taken the night
before. As is expected from Lee, his

"original use of camera angles, particu-

larly during flashbacks, casts a
macabre light over the entire film. In
doing this, Lee forces you to laugh but
at the same time makes you feel
remorse for doing so.

With witty social commentary,
intriguing camera work and, of course,
a stunning performance from Keitel,
Clockers makes you do whatso many
of today’s gangsta-drug films don’t:
feel.

On Columbus Day weekend,
there’s a convention of major
proportions happening in
South Miami Beach. “How
Can I Be Down ‘95” can be
the answer for the striving rap
artist with a demo that's trying
to get put on. It takes place
Oct. 5th thru the 9th; get in

the near future, there’s a con-

should be the buttah. Also, the
Kappas are throwin’ a
“Player’s Ball” in the Union
tomorrow night for those who

    

able to make
the concert. The deejay at this
point is a mystery, but the dent
is minimal. Enough is enough.
Let’s handle this.

Album: Clockers Soundtrack
Producer(s): Various

label: 40 Acres & A Mule/
MCA Soundtracks
rating:--@@@ 1/2

By now everyone has to be
familiar with the first single,
“Return Of The Crooklyn
Dodgers.” If not, where the
hell have you been? O.C.,
Jeru The Damaja, and Chubb
Rock (can we say resurrection
boys and girls?) rip ‘95
Bucktown flave over a
smoothed-out, cholesterol-
spreaded jazz track with com-
plementary drums to produce
the new burger of the month.
Complete with samples from
the ‘94 Crooklyn Dodgers, it’s
a true-to-the-heart sequel. But

where does that leave the rest
of the album?

Clockers  is more of an
R&B soundtrack. Marc
Dorsey represents twice with
“Changes” (flavored like Kool
G. Rap’s “|ll Street Blues”) and
“People In Search Of A Life.”
His soulful offerings are com-
plimented well with the addi-
tion of a ballad by 1970’s wild
child Chaka Khan. “Love Me
Still," with the piano as the pri-
mary instrument, is not one to
be slept at all. Seal drops his
contribution in the form of
“Bird Of Freedom." With a
sturdy drum track and an ill
piano line, it could’ve easily
been a hip hop track; Seal
uses it nicely. “Bad Boy No
Go A Jail" has Mega Banton
deejayin’ over a buttah track
with a jazz feel; different, but it
works.

This album also attempts to
introduce newrap groups
Rebelz Of Authority, Strictly
Difficult and BrookIyNytes.
Although the music for the
most part on their tracks was
tight, the songs as a whole
were kind of “hum drum.”
They’re i-ight, but definitely
nothin’ to check for as new
artists. The flavor of the first
single is misleading; you have
to take a sideways approach
to truly appreciate the album
after hearing it.

Overall, it’s a tight album.
Clockers will have you
checkin’ for the smooth side of
your soul. Just keep in mind,
it’s not a hip hop soundtrack.

Artist: Doug E. Fresh
Album: Play
Producer(s): Various
label: Gee Street/lsland

' rating: @@@ 1/2

If you've heard such classic
tunes as “Keep Risin’ To The
Top,” “The Show” and “La Di
Da Di” featuring Slick Rick,
then you have to know who
this kid is. Doug commercially
dropped on the scene circa
1985 and has been dippin’ in
and out. With his first album,
Th_e World’s Greatest
Entertainer, he etched his
name in the hip hop stone. If
you don’t believe me, you can
also check for “Cut That
Zero.” Because of contractual
difficulties with that label and
the subsequent loss of set
label, Doug was left out the
mix — a classic memory. He
resurfaced under Hammer’s
Bust It Records with an effort
reminiscent of his boss which
began to cost him his audi-
ence — the true to life Hip
Hop heads. in the nine nickel,
he’s back to reclaim his spot
as a phat entertainer.

With this new album, he's
out to achieve that status once
more. With the first two install-
ments, the Hjp l-‘lop street call
anthem “l-ight” and the now
dance-hall classic “Freaks”
with his young protégé
Vicious, heads were taken by
storm and had people
screamin’ the infamous
Poltergeist statement —
“Heeeeeee’s Baaaaaackll”
With his current single and
video, “Where's Da Party
At?” he’s establishing himself
as sort of an East coast Luke.
lt’s nothin’ more than cal|-and-
response over classic hip hop
beats (read: “The 900
Number,” ‘‘I Got It Made,”
“PSK,” “JBeez Comin’ Thru”
and others). Speakin’ of.Luke,
they do a collaboration on the
joint “Freak It Out.” I call it
‘New York Bass.’

For the most part, the album
is tight. There are a few hang
ups. Most of the music is pop-
pin’, but the rhymes don’t
always fit. Since the rhymes
are severely lackluster at
times, it makes this album an
easy sleeper when it shouldn’t
be. Although Doug's
rhymestyle is old school, the
tracks are 1995 - 1997.

This is not a sleeper, but not
a standout either. Another
note of advice: you have to be
a true old school head to get
full appreciation for Doug’s fla-
vor. If you do decide to make
that purchase, take heed to
the album title and play it all
the way through.

Since there are, once again,

no phat singles to report, there
will be no Starting 5 Singles of
the Week. Check for me the
next time i decide to get my
fingers dirty  in the crates.
Squeeze, kids.

Scene

Two Saturdays ago, I woke
up earlier than you probably
did and went to the “Spiritsof
lndependence” convention at

the Holiday Inn in Oakland.-I

There were about 25 zine writ-
ers and independent comic
artists there, all of them at
tables where you could easily
talk to them, and all of them
with copies of their stuff to sell.
Needless to say, I had a great
time, especially since every-
thing I bought there is tax
deductible if I review it here.
So, without further ado:
Chronic Apathy 1-2 tells
the story of an alcoholic slack-
er named Sarah, and her

struggle to be productive. I can

see a lot of Love and Fiockets
influence in the writing. Oh, I’m
kidding myself. None of you
know what Love and Fiockets
is, Sigh. Anyway, the front
covers are computer colored,
and they are absolutely beauti-
ful. The guy who does album
covers for the Cure (Paris) had
something to do with them, but
I can’t figure out what from the
credits. The art inside has a
few rough edges, but it tells
the story well. Now, if we could
work a little on the anatomy 
Chronic Apathy 1-2 should
be available by mail from:
llliterature P‘ress/ P.O. Box 61/
Pickerington, Ohio 48147-
0061 at $2.95 each.
Everything Sucks and
More collects the first four
issues of this great comic, with
a sparse helping of new mate-
rial. Basically, it tells the story
of Jason, a grumpy young
man who lives in Pittsburgh’s
East End (Hey! Kind of like
usl). You get Jason trying to
pick up girls, trying to convince
girls that he’s not gay, going to
shows, and other adventures
of that ilk. I get the feeling that
it is at least semi-autobio-
graphical. lt's full of references
that we’ll get, but probably
won’t mean one damn thing to
anyone outside of our little
geographical social circle. But
we get them, and they are
really funny, so that’s all that
matters, right? I feel like the
guy who wrote this has been
following me around and
chronicling my life lately. It’s
that close. The artwork is pret-
ty basic, but it works quite well
with this. It's available from:
Randy C./ 7332 Schley Ave./
Pittsburgh, PA 15218 for $1,
and it’s well worth it, man.
Me: a comic by and for God
tells the story of Jesus meet-
ing God in 2009 with drawn
line art and pictures. I think
this works best when line art of
God gets superimposed over a
picture, which happens a cou-
ple of times. The art is very
distinctive, and looks like no

 

one else I have ever seen. The
story itself is narrated by God,
and is very conversational. My
favorite line occurs when
Jesus bursts in on God, who
responds: “Oh Jesus  always
in the middle of Clarissa
(Explains it All)  “ I‘ also like
the endorsement by two-thirds
of the Trinity for Marlboro Light
Menthol. I think that someone
is going to hell over this
delightful little zine. Anyway,
it’s available from: Baby Head
lmages/ c/o David NoweIl/ 31
Applewood Ct./ Horsham, Pa.
19044. I think it's 75 cents.
Well, that’s all the zines for
this time. Yesterday I went to
the South Side and discovered
that Slacker and The Eye of
Horus, both on Carson St., sell
zines. As always, direct ques-
tions or comments via e-mail

past the William Pitt Union
could not fail to notice the cor-
porate panhandlers who sit
and offer us credit cards,
phone cards, tennis shoes and
books. These aren’t the only
ways in which the rights to us
are sold. On the scoreboards
and wall of the Pitt Stadium,
Coca-Cola has purchased a
right to be seen throughout the
games. Even in the dorms,
there are ads.

The Campus Fest was put
together by a booking agency
that sold its fair to the Pitt
Program Council. The PPC’s
stance on things like this is
that there must be something
in it for the students——- freebies
and entertainment value, said
Tom Misuraca of the PPC. The
PPC does not pay for these
events to come. it will cover
some of the ancillary costs,
like security and garbage col-
lection. While some campuses
will pay to bring in an event

like this, the PPC will not pay

for it since it is recognized as
an ad campaign. Misuraca
said, “We aren’t here tosell
anyone’s product.” The corpo-
rations, however, are here to
sell, he said.

And where the money really
goes is out of your pockets
and into corporate coffers.
That Pitt is an institution of
higher learning is very true.
But what’s being taught is that
it's acceptable for our campus
to sponsor high-stakes ad
campaigns such as Campus
Fest. While many students and
administrators jabber endlessly
about the “problem” with pan-
handlers on Forbes Ave.,
there's yet to be even one
voice raised to rid the WPU of
these aggressive solicitors,
these corporate panhandlers,
who daily ask for handouts for
their merchandise. Pitt has

been "turned "
into another
Monroeville,
for those men and women who
ask for much more than a
dime.

While the administration con-
dones bringing the market of
merchandise into the market-
place of ideas, it won’t let us
bring in any bands. Nothing for
the students, by the students
and of the students is con-
doned.

I spoke with some of these
poster, phone card and credit
card solicitors who showed me
they have an interesting gig.
They tour campuses like
speakers or bands to drum up
business. The young lady who
was trying to give me a phone
card has been as far west as
Phoenix,,Ariz., and down to
Florida recruiting the next gen-
eration of Sprint callers.

Some of you may have
noticed that in the dorms this
year there are public service-
type announcements on
boards, produced by the
Campus Voice. At the bottom
are ads for candy bars and
caffeine pills. The housing
office approved these signs.
They are produced by a com-
pany called “Campus Voice”
and will feature public service-
type ads on subjects such as
time management on a month-
ly basis. They were approved
with the understanding that
there would be no hard-core
advertising, but rather a men-
tion of the sponsors.

Let’s return to Dr.
Thompson’s idea, that politics
is the art of controlling your
environment. The promises of
no obligation and free t-shirts
seem pretty innocuous. But
consider it in terms of what
they are really offering. T_hey
certainly aren’t giving you that
shirt because they are worried

y o u
cl 0 n ’ t
h a v e
enough clothes. That shirt is
an advertisement. The corpo-
rate world wants to make you
into a walking billboard.

When you’re sitting in class,
listening to the professor lec-
ture, you’re receiving sublimi-
nal messages from the guy’s
shirt in front of you. You don’t
really know until the moment of
truth comes and you’re buying
their product. The question
becomes: why are you doing
the things you do? There are
forces out there that are trying
to control you, and they want
you to believe that it is the U.S.
government, the United
Nations, the liberal or conserv-
ative media, but it's really the
Madison Avenue media that
are running things.

We have a responsibility to
ourselves not to buy into this
corporate culture lock, stock
and barrel. Continuously, mar-
ket surveys determine what
will be made available to us
and for how much. While the
corporate monster is here with
us to stay, it can be tamed and
put to work for us. Some cor-
porate sponsorship is neces-
sary in a climate where even
the government wants to be
stuffed into private industry’s
mold. But at the same time, we
do not have to become their
drones. They are like technolo-
gy: we can either learn to con-
trol them responsibly or have
them control us.

So the next time corporate
America asks you, “can you
spare a little change to help
me out?” remember: to put
money in its paper cup is to
help those who forced all the
other panhandlers into the
street to do the same thing to
you.

This Saturday, local musi-
cians, artists and poets will
come together to fire a shot in
a cultural revolution. This time
around, homelessness is star-
ing down the barrel.

The multi-faceted “Peace
Gathering” will benefit the
Duncan and Porter House on
the North Side, a homeless
shelter that local activist
Vincent Eirene has run for 19
years out of his home and from
his heart.

The idea for the Peace
Gathering began five years
ago as art shows for the home-
less. Many people had motiva-
tion to work on the issue, “but
didn’t have the context to do it
in. The art show  gave them
a way to do that — a way to

Chita Rivera

 

  

meet the homeless,” said
Eirene.

One of the goals of the bene-
fit is to show people that the
poor are a hardworking but
excluded group, not a social
blight. “There’s no reason for
there to be so many homeless
people, because there are so
many empty houses in the
city,” said Evan Knauerof
A.T.S. Knauer said he sees
“imagination” as a powerful
catalyst for social change.
Exposing people to new ideas
can help the homeless and
poor see alternatives to the
desperation.

Involved in every cause from
welfare cuts to Iraq's impover-
ished children suffering under
the U.S. sanctions to NATO
bombing in Sarajevo,.Eirene
believes in cultural — as
opposed to political — revolu-
tion. “lt’s been kind of exciting,
because I think that we don't

  RIL

have any political platform, and

   

if we did we’d probably argue
for days on which way it should
be nailed or how it should be

taken apart or screwed and

hammered,” he chuckled.
Lenny Williams of Blindsight
believes that every person has
been given the gift of passion;
every person has a gift to give
the world. It was Eirene’s pas-
sion that first attracted Williams
to the Peace Gathering.
Williams, who grew up listen-
inglto groups like Santana and
The Last Poets, realizes the
power for change that music
can yield. ‘When it's done right
by the right people, it just tran-
scends everything."

The band line-up is: The
Feral Family, Brooke

_ Smokelin, PSOAS, Blindsight,

Bucky Guda, Mother McFlee’s
Garden ' and A. T.S. The
Gathering starts at 9 p.m. at
1332 Sheﬁeld Street. Call 231-
2766 for details.

fessional ethics, including mis-
representation.

“Pitt has absolutely no inter-
est in this whatsoever,” Sekas
said. “Actually, we were criti-
cized by Pitt for even writing
the paper. We were told not to
publish it because it would
make doctors look bad.”

The individuals critical of the
study_ recently left Pitt. Their
departures had nothing to do
with their criticism of the paper,
Sekassaid.

A spokesperson from the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center said, “We Sup-
port and encourage academic
freedom.”

ter’s freshmen.

“We hung posters and did everything-
that worked for us in the past,” said
Wendi Wiley,a sorority rush counselor.
“But this year the numbers were just
lower.”

One of the major reasons that Wiley
said she feels that Greek life didn’t appeal
to as many women this year is because
Pitt is an urban campus and it iSn’t as nec-
essary to join a sorority to meet people as
it would be at a smaller college.

“There is so much to do around cam-
pus,” she said. “Going Greek iSn’t some-
thing you need to do to meet people, but
they don’t realize how much more there is
to it.” _

Although not nearly as drastically, the
fraternities also experienced a decline in

pledge initiations.

According to Cyrus Zolghadri,
Interfraternity Council vice president,
only 223' men pledged this fall as opposed
to 253 last fall. He said that last fall had
the highest number of recruitments, and
216 was the lowest, during fall rush in
1988.

Zolghadri said he feels that the alleged
sexual assault charges last year inﬂuenced
independents’ decisions this year not to
join a fraternity.

“All of the negative publicity that we
received last year inﬂuenced many peo-
ple,” he said.

That wasn’t the only explanation that
Zolghadri gave. He also said that each
freshman class consists of ‘students with
different priorities.

“You also have a different group of peo-

ple that make up the freshman class each
year,” he said. “We have no control over
the chemistry of personalities that vary
from year to year; it’s out of our hands.”

Doug Siegel, IFC president, said that
students’ personalities have changed.

“Students are having more fun being
individuals,” he said. “But they are clos-
ing certain avenues that would otherwise
be open if they were Greek.”

He said that some of these opportunities
include attending social events, self-
advancement opportunities and obtaining
leadership skills.

Wiley said that she also doeSn’t think
that the alleged sexual assault charge had
much to do with the lack of pledges.

“It had a little something to do with it,”
she said. “But most of the incoming fresh-
men didn’t even know about that.”

Keep it a Burgh thing

Last night, something remarkable happened. The Pittsburgh
Pirates played. their last home game of the season, and it may
have been the last Major League Baseball game the city of
Pittsburgh ever sees. After 109 years, an era may be coming to
an end.

The Pirates have been plagued by several losing seasons, the
baseball strike, disheartened and disinterested fans and a rash
of financial difficulties. Though they have a temporary home
at Three Rivers, they still don’t have anyone to love them.

Ten people presently control the Pirates franchise, and seven
of them have to agree before the team can be sold. In other
words, it will take four votes to keep the team in Pittsburgh.
With the huge debt the Pirates are carrying, it is difficult
enough—to find anyone willing to take the risk of incurring

‘almost $90 million in instant debt.

It seems, however, that the present owners have found every
reason not to let prospective buyers carry out a deal. John
Regas was only one who was refused, and others were never
even allowed into the running. As soon as someone shows any
signs of interest, the present owners balk and stick their heads
into the Astroturf.

If the Pirate owners do not find a buyer soon, there is a very
real possibility that next summer will be very boring around
the Burgh. The Fedko Zone is not going to be very exciting if
we have to watch scenes of the blood-and-guts, knock-down,
fight-of-the-century battle between the Burrell Elementary

_ intramural little league teams.

Aside from eliminating a place to enjoy a refreshing $5 beer,
if baseball leaves Pittsburgh, the city’s economy will suffer a
huge blow. Even though attendance has fallen to dismal levels,
the past has seen floods of people visiting the city during base-

.-ball season. Something tells us that the Stingers indoor soccer

team is not going to attract that great of a following.

Baseball is a part of Pittsburgh’s history and tradition. If you
have ever been in Forbes Quad, you might have noticed a
cloudy piece of glass on the floor. You can barely see through
it now, but it covers the home plate of the old Forbes Field.
The back wall still stands too, though it is covered by ivy.‘
Ironically, that field is what all the prospective buyers want
back.

Many native Pittsburghers say they would love for the city
to rid itself of the “football town” image.‘ Well, there’s no pro
basketball team, and the hockey‘ team _didn’t sell out playoff,
games last year. There has to be more to Pittsburgh sports then
the Stillers. . ‘

The city of Pittsburgh needs to find a way to keep the Pirates
in Pittsburgh. There has to be some way to raise the money,

. and if there isn’t, then maybe some of the ridiculous demands“

the present owners are asking of a buyer should be reevaluat-

wed. Whatever it takes, though, the city should do everything it
can to keep the Pirates in Pittsburgh. ‘

Calvin and Hobbes each

(Following is an interview’

with Calvin on NBC’s “Face
the Nation.”)

NBC: What are the primary
issues between Hobbes and
yourself, Calvin?

Calvin: -I am your typical
hard-working, blue-collar
worker, despite what has
been published about me and
my work ethic in kinder-

garten. Hobbes, however, is

such an elitist that he did not
even bother going to school!
To further promote his aris-
tocratic image, he calls him-
self the “king of the jungle
called America!” That
snazzy striped suit he wears
all the time proves my point
that he’s an elitist!

NBC: Calvin, let us in on
your political ideology.
Calvin: Hobbes’ policies are
regressive, meaning he talks,
brags and disappoints.
Conversely, my agenda is
progressive, reflecting both
the will of the people and the
needs of the nation. I am a
conceptual realist. Hobbes,
on the other hand, is nothing
but your run-of-the-mill ide-
alistic visionary!

NBC: Calvin, could you
please expand on your agen-
da a little for us‘?

Calvin: Hobbes is a military

expansionist. He is the one
who devised Calvinball. not
me! I, however, am a mili-
tary isolationist, meaning I
would appropriate money we
now spend on defense on
things like banning math
books and jailing cruel and
insensitive babysitters. I sup-
port free trade, while Hobbes
doesn’t share anything. For
example, yesterday I asked
him if I could have a spoon-
ful of his Chocolate Frosted
Sugar Bombs, and he
responded by telling me to

go buy my own! This outra- _.
geous behavior cannot be '

tolerated! On a global level.
this form of greed could
jeopardize our national secu-
rity and threaten the compet-
itive edge we hold over the
rest of the world. Hence, you
can see why Hobbes is
denounced as a socialist. I,
however, am a pure laissez-
faire capitalist; someone
who will plan, impose and
deliver; someone capable of
ridding of tiger-like elitists
such as Hobbes who lie wait-
ing in the thickets, stealthily
stalking, catching and
devouring the unsuspecting
population with their ruinous
radical plans for action!
NBC: I see 

Calvin: Hey, wait?!! Is this
interview being recorded?!
Televised?! Am I being
framed?! You’ll hear from
my lawyer, you senseless
reporter!! Wa, wa, wait -— I
really didn’t mean anything I
said about you Hobbes!!

Stadium renovations lead Pitt into next century

By-Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

A podium sits on top of the plush, blue
carpet, ready for the veteran coach, one of
the winningest in Division I football, to
claim it. .

In the front of the spacious room lie
wooden lockers ﬁlled with jerseys, hel-
mets and shoes from some of the best
players ever to play for theteam. ‘

‘A shiny glass door separates the players
from these rooms to the playing ﬁeld, one
on which nine national championships
have been won.

It sounds like the home of the_Fighting
Irish, where Knute Rockne told his boys
to win one for the Gipper and Joe
Montanavbegan his hall-of-farne career.
Or maybe it’s the blue—and-maize locker
room of the

rounded by glass creates" a wave that
allows players to swim against the cur-
rent. It is one of two pools of its kind in
the Pittsburgh area, and Pitt is one of ﬁve
colleges in the country to have this pool.
Adjacent to the pool is a l0-person
jacuzzi, for more rehabilitation purposes.

Along with the pool, head team physi-
cian Freddie Fu has a renovated training
room with which to work. The 26 taping
and examining tables almost triple the old
size. .

The revamped complex also has an
enlarged locker room and new training,
weight and equipment rooms. The weight
training room, much like many of the
other rooms in the complex, is surrounded
by glass. ,

Phase one of the project cost $6.6 mil-
lion, the most expensive of the stages. It

facility to be con-
nected to a new

helm of the
podium is Pitt’s Johnny Majors; the
retired jerseys once belonged to‘Marino,
Dorsett, Green and Fralic; and the ﬁeld is
the turf of Pitt Stadium. The changes are
just part of the Second Century plan at Pitt
to improve the overall quality of the
school’s athletic facilities.

The Duratz Athletic Complex is the
renovated, reconstructed home of the Pitt
Panthers football team and is now consid-
ered one of the premier college athletic
facilities in the country. Only one phase
out of eight has been completed, but when
the nearly $20 million facility is ready to
go, Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
said, it will put Pitt over the top.

“The University of Pittsburgh is.chart-
ing the course to lead our intercollegiate
athletics program into the 21st century,”
Jaynes said in a packet about the new

_ facility.

“This new complex will give our stu-
dent athletes an excellent facility for train-
ing and will enhance our recruiting efforts
for the future,” he added.

One highlight of the facility is a
hydrotherapy pool. The 15-foot pool sur-

the early plan-
ning process. ‘

Majors was a big inﬂuence in getting
the facility’s improvements off the
ground. The University of Tennessee,
Majors’ old school, always had a top ath-
letic center, and he wanted to bring that to
Pitt. v

“This project can’t be underestimated.
When it is completed, we will have facili-
ties that everyone who loves Pitt will be
proud of,” Majors said in the Second
Century guide.

Other phases for the project include an
improved academic support services area
which will have a library, a computer lab
and an enlarged study lounge. There will
also be an improved sports medicine facil-
ity, a new band room and an improved
visitors’ locker room. '

According to Pitt’s Sports Information
Department, the money for the entire pro-
ject was raised solely from outside
sources. The lead gift for the facility was
donated by James and Helene Barco
Duratz, in honor of George Barco, a 1934
Pitt Law School graduate and a Pitt
trustee.

another way to tai/gate

 

By Kevin Henderson
For The Pitt News

The 1995 football season has been a great suc-
cess so far. The football team started out 2-1, a feat that
had not been accomplished since 1991. The ﬁrst phase
of the renovation process of the football facilities has
been completed. Two new additions to the game day fes-
tivities have also been added this year — the state-of-
the-art scoreboard in the north end zone and The Golden
Panther Sports Village. What is the sports village and is
it a good idea? Read on 

The Golden Panther Sports Village is an inter-
active area where fans are able to test their skills in such
sports as baseball, basketball, football, gymnastics, soc-
cer, swimming, tennis, track and volleyball.

It is located in the Charles L. Cost Sports Center
above the stadium next to the Towerview Parking
Garage. The Cost Center contains a regulation-sized
football ﬁeld with an artiﬁcial playing surface. This foot-
ba_ll ﬁeld is where the sports village can be found.

In addition to the interactive sports, the sports
village also offers a variety of food and drink, in a buf-
fet-style setting.

Admission into the Village is free. Games and
refreshments are not. Tickets are sold for the different
games at a cost of 25 cents each and ﬁve for $1. Each

’ . ticket_is worth one chance at any of the nine different

sports offered. The food and drink vary in price. The
cost for Golden Panther Alumni Association members
and those who register in advance is $10. Otherwise it’s
$12 at the door. Children under 6 get in for $6, $5 with a
reservation.

The Sports Village is open two hours prior to
every home Panther football game.

The overall reaction to the sports village has been very

good.
Joan Shinavski, the gifts and events coordinator, is
very happy about the last two pre-game efforts. “We had
about 500 people for the Washington State game and
600 for the Eastern Michigan game.”

Donna Sarift of the athletics department is also very
enthusiastic. “Last week we were throwing people out of
here to go to the football game.”

Most of the fans seem‘ to agree that the Sports Village
is a good idea.

‘This is a really good idea in a nice facility. I’m very
impressed,” said Ron Hassen of Elwood City.

Pat Giebel of McKeesport was similarly impressed.

“It is pretty well-equipped. I also think it is a good
idea to have something before the football game,” she
said.

“It is real good. I liked soccer the best.” remarked
Brian Smith, age 9, of Gibsonia.

None of the current football players are allowed to
attend the sports village festivities, but former players
have no such restrictions. The former players present
before the game against Eastern Michigan included
Joseph Pohl (‘64-’66), Bob Steinbeck (‘80-’85), Mike
Dorrundo (‘8l—’85) and Roman Matusz ( ‘85—’89).

Matusz is enthused that an event like this is now being
offered.

‘‘It brings old Pitt fans, new Pitt fans and old Pitt play-i

ers together to experience the resurgence of the Pitt pro-
gram under Jonny Majors,” he said.

None of the other former players were quite as whim-
sical as Matusz, but they were all very impressed with
the facultities.

The events represented at the Sports Village are run by
student athletes. Most of the student athletes seem very
excited about the addition of the Sports Village.

Mike Myers, a representative of the gymnastics team.
feels that the interaction with fans is a great idea.

“It exposes people to the other varsity sports at Pitt
other than football and basketball.”

The basketball representatives, Kevin Jordan and
Oliver Antigua, also liked the idea.

“It’s a good opportunity to let little kids get exposure
to the players” said Antigua.

Jordan also thinks the Sports Village is a good idea.

The Pitt News, Thursday, September 21, 1995

Fall guy or nai, Ryan is No. I quarterback

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

John Ryan is everywhere. _

Featured on this year’s Pitt football schedule, he’s
plastered on almost every campus store window. Ryan
has the dubious duty as Pitt’s marketing tool for ticket
sales. And why not? He’s the cagey veteran quarter-
back who emerged late last season to lead the Big East
in passing efficiency.

Along with posing as Pitt’s poster boy, Ryan also
moonlights as Pitt’s fall guy. When something goes
wrong, namely a loss, all the blame seemingly lands on
his shoulders. Case and point, after the Panthers’ 38-27
loss last week at Texas, a sign was soon raised in a
Brackenridge Hall window. It read: “It’s John Ryan’s
Fault. We want Pete — #10.” The sign, strategically
placed so everyone walking through the Schenley
Quad can see it, beckoned for Ryan’s backup, Pete
Gonzalez.

“They don’t know what they’re talking about,” head
coach Johnny Majors said. “Anyone can put up signs.
Anyone can do things anonymously. That doesn’t take
any guts. That doesn’t take any knowledge.”

Maybe not as blatant as a sign, but Ryan is used to
this kind of alienation.

“It’s not right that that happens,” Ryan said, “but it
seems like at any level you’re at, they always put the
blame on the quarterback or the coaching staff.” .

Ryan has been mired in a quarterback controversy
since his sophomore year. But coming into this year,
the 6-foot-3, 210-pound fifth—year senior finally
secured the starting job for good after the coaching
staff named him the No. 1 man before spring practice.

“It was a great feeling not having to look over my
shoulder,” Ryan said. “The coaches had confidence in
me, the other players had confidence in me, which

“He’s a tough kid, John Ryan
doesn’t get rattled”

—Johnny Majors
Head football coach

made me more conﬁdent. It’s a situation every quarter-
back wants to be in, because you don’t want to have to
worry about every little mistake.”

His confidence showed. In the ﬁrst game of the year
against Washington State, Ryan orchestrated two
fourth-quarter touchdowns to lift Pitt to a 17-13 upset
win. The following week against Eastern Michigan,
Ryan once again looked golden as he connected for
three touchdowns and 288 yards in limited playing
time.

The Panthers were 2-0 and the fans’ once-growing
skepticism had subsided. Ryan was no longer the goat.
He was the now the heroic quarterback.

That is, until last week against Texas. Ryan’s perfor-
mance was less than heroic, as he threw five intercep-
tions. Pitt had a chance to win against the No. 15
Longhorns, but key interceptions in the second half
killed that opportunity.

The fans grew more than restless, they grew rowdy.
It doesn’t matter that the defense allowed big play after
big play in the fourth quarter, and it doesn’t matter that
Majors openly lambasted the receivers for running
wrong routes, it was still Ryan’s.fault. He went from
goat to hero to goat again —-— so be the life of a Division
I quarterback, always under the public microscope.

Now the fans are calling for the his backup.

“There’s a saying that says ‘the most popular guy on
the squad is the second—team quarterback,” Majors
said, “because he’s not the guy out there on the line.
And everybody, colleges and pro fans, always want to
see the second—team quarterback in there when the
team isn’t doing well.”

For example, when Steeler quarterback Neil
O’Donnell struggled, the whole city cried for Mike
Tomczak. Anyone who witnessed last Monday night’s
game against the Dolphins saw Tomczak throw inter-
ception after interception. He’s not the man to run the
team, but it’s the fans’ innate nature to want the sec-
ond-string quarterback. But there are reasons why
someone is second-string.

“The quarterback is the most
obvious position on the football
team,” Majors said. “lt’s nor-
mally the most second-guessed
position on the field, and the
average fan doesn’t know a
thing about football. They
oversimplify. They don’t know
the sophistication of the game
or the details about it.”

Going into last year, which
followed a dismal sophomore

‘ year for Ryan, the Pitt coachin g
staff went out and got Sean

I Fitzgerald, a junior college phe-
nomenon who threw for over
3,000 yards in one season. The
coaches gave Fitzgerald the job
immediately, and Ryan was the
odd man out. But Fitzgerald
struggled early and often, as he
threw only four touchdowns in
seven games. The staff still
remained firm in its decision
and left Fitzgerald in while
Ryan sat on the sidelines.

“The coaching staff felt it
would be in the best interest to
go out and get a guy who can
play right away,” Ryan said. “I
can’t blame them for that. It
was just a shock not to get a
chance. I realized the job was
pretty much his to lose, but
they pretty much gave it to
him.

“I want to get into coaching,
and I’m sure if I was put in the
same situation, I would have
done the same thing.”

Finally, after waiting seven
games, Ryan got his chance on
homecoming against West
Virginia. His ﬁrst pass was one
he would like to forget. He
dropped back and threw an
interception that was returned
for a touchdown.

“I was like, ‘I ﬁnally got my
opportunity and I blew it,”’ the
Ohio native said.

But it would take more than
an interception to drown Ryan
this time around. He came back
and threw for 433 yards and
four touchdowns, which landed
him second in Pitt’s record
books for the most yards in a
game. John Congemi had 446

for Pitt, but after the tough loss last week at

exas I would have loved to see a Temple or a
Rutgers. Another blowout would be nice for the
morale of the players and fans.

‘Nah, let’s play Ohio State, anotherranked
team. Hey, they’re even better than Texas. What a
great idea,” said the scheduling gods in Pitt Stadium.
Ohio State may not be the best team in the
Columnist country, but it’s the seventh best. Pitt has not beaten
Matt a ranked opponent since I was in ninth grade. The
Grove year was 1989, and The Bangles were rockin’ the
house. The Panthers knocked Off Texas A&M in the

John Hancock Bowl 31-28.

Not one win against a Top 25 team in six years. Why, then, would
you schedule Texas and OSU back-to-back? I’m sure Sean Fitzgerald
knows, but where has he been lately? .

Coming into the game the Panthers are 2-1, tops in the Big Least,
while the Buckeyes are 2-0, third in the Big 10/ ll behind Michigan
and Penn State. ' -

Pitt dropped its first of the season 38-27 at Texas in a game that it
could have, and should have, won. The Panthers played possibly the
best game in recent memory, but mistakes cost them the game.

Ohio State disposed of No. 18 Washington 30-20 in its ﬁrst game

Receivers put to test by Majors after poor performance  

By Brad Isles

Sports Editor

Catch the ball.

Oh. if it were only that easy.

After‘Pitt’s near—upset of the No. 15 Texas
Longhorns last Saturday. no part of the team felt
coach Johnny Majors’ wrath more than the wide
receivers. -

“We played with a tremendous amount of confi-
dence and effort, with exception to our receiving
corps,” Majors said. “I didn’t’think that they gave
the effort that the rest of the team gave, and I did
not think that their discipline and smarts was very
impressive.”

There is no room for excuses to be made, like
“it was the first road trip of the year,” or “the turf
was slippery” or “it was hot.”

Indeed, it was hot. It was nearly 120 sweltering,
middle-of—September-in-Texas degrees on the
field during the game.

Majors didn’t care.

“It was hot,” he said, “but it was hot for a lot of
people.”

Ouch. _

On Saturday when the No. 7 Ohio State
Buckeyes come to town, it won’t be anywhere
near 90 degrees, so everything should be all right.
Shouldn’t it?

“Ohio State will be the best team, including
Texas, that we have played at this point. I have
never seen a team with so much size and height,
and they are loaded in terms of ability,” Majors
saidabout the Buckeyes. “The cornerback, Shawn
Springs, is a big young cornerback who played
last year as a freshman.”

Springs (6-foot, 185) will most likely have
the responsibility of covering Dietrich Jells. In
the first game of the year against Boston
College, Springs had an interception, six tackles
and a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.
He added five tackles last week against
Washington.

But for Majors, it doesn’t matter who is out
there on coverage — the receivers just have to
improve their performance.

“It’s got to be done better,” he said. “The chal-

6-foot-6, 330 pound sophomore anchors OSU’s offensive line

.responsible for getting the

lenge has got to be put -~
out there for them. I certain-
ly plan to do that myself,
plus I expect some other
people to put the challenge
to them.”

Majors said that his
challenge to them would
come this week during prac-
tice.

On paper, it is hard to
believe the receivers aren’t
doing well.

First, there is the man

ball to the receivers, quarter-
back John Ryan. He is first
in the conference in total
offense with a 250-yard
average. He is fourth in
efficiency at 121.01, com-
pleting 57 of 103 attempts
for 760 yards,"six touch-
downs and eight intercep-
tions.

Jells is first in the Big East
in receptions (6.0 avg), and
scoring (10.0 avg) and sec-
ond in receiving yardage
with 101.7 per game. He’s
also added five TDs.

Sadiq Durham has 17
catches for 234 yards, Curtis
Anderson has nine catches
for 78 yards and Mark Butler
has five catches for 105
yards. .

So, what’s the problem?

According to Majors, the
answer lies in the effort the receivers are giving.

“I am disappointed, and [the receivers] have
to reach up to a better level right now for us
to be as good as we can be,” Majors said. “Too
many other people are giving good effort;
too many other people are doing things correct-
ly.”

Majors said at least two of Ryan’s interceptions

in the Texas game were a result of the receivers
running the wrong route, ending up at the wrong
depth.

This absolutely cannot happen against Ohio
State. . ‘

For the Panthers to have a chance against
the Buckeyes, the receivers, and Ryan, must
execute the offensive gameplan to perfection.

- By Mike Kovak

Asst. Sports Editor

This Saturday when the seventh-
ranked Ohio State Buckeyes travel
to Pittsburgh to play the Panthers,
their key concern lies with getting
runner Eddie George the ball.

So far this season, George has car-

ried the ball 53 times for 311 yards.
and four touchdowns.

Leading the way for George is the
best offensive line the Panthers will
see this season. Say hello to:
Orlando Pace, Jamie Sumner, Juan

Porter, LeShun Daniels and Eric.

Gohlstin.
Perhaps no one in the nation is

better than Pace.

“Pace is a good athlete,” Ohio
State head coach John Cooper said.
“He is a big, strong football player,
he's got good foot speed —— some-
times I wonder why I am not playing
him on the defensive side of the
ball.” _

Pace started all 13 games last sea-
son for Ohio State as a true fresh-
man. He logged the most minutes
ever for a Buckeye freshman. The 6-
foot-6, 330—pounder was named Big
Ten Freshman of the Year and even
plays on goal-line defensive situa-
tions.

“He’s a real fine football player,”
Cooper said.

So far this season, Pace has helped
the vaunted Ohio State offense to
a whopping 469 yards per game.
Pace already appears to be the
favorite for the Outland Trophy,
which goes to the best offensive
lineman in college, and has been
mentioned as the best lineman in
Buckeye history.

In his spare time, Pace enjoys the
peace and tranquility of the Lake
Erie waters in search of large fish.

Sumner, norelation to David,
weighs in at 290. This is Sumner’s
second year as starter. According to
coaches, he possesses the best atti-
tude on the team and is the line’s
best run blocker.

In his spare time, Sumner likes to
relax with a good book.

The 285—pound Porter anchors the

_ line at center in his second year at

the position. He played guard before
last season, but garnered honorable
mention All-Big Ten honors last sea-
son. Porter played all but five downs
for OSU last season. He is consid-
ered the most versatile lineman on
the Buckeyes and can play any of
the three interior line positions.

Daniels is starting his second sea-
son as the Buckeye right guard. He
started every game and was second
on the team in minutes last year,
behind Pace. »

The 285—pound junior enjoys col-
lecting 50-cent pieces.

Gohlstin is the shortest member of
the line at 6-3, but he tips the scales
at 295 pounds. The sophomore has
replaced All-American Korey
Stringer at right tackle. Gohlstin
played in nine games last season and
finished the year as the back-up cen-
ter. He also logged time at guard
before he was moved to tackle this
spring. He is Porter’s cousin. '

His hobbies include bowling and
working on electrical projects.

The Ohio State line averages 6-4
and weighs 297.

“Ohio State has a big offensive
line,” Pitt head coach Johnny Majors
said. “I have never seen a team with
so much size and height, and they
are loaded in terms of ability.”

There will be no argument from
the Buckeye side. .

“We do have a great offensive
line,” Cooper said.

Forget about the Irish, Buckeyes focus on Pitt

By Brian Sollsh
Ixintem sports writer

Editor’s note: Brian Sollsh is a sports writer for The
Larztem, the student newspaper at Ohio State University.

Walking around campus, one tends to see more Ohio
State-Notre Dame shirts and assorted paiaphemalia than
Ohio State-Pittsburgh. However, the coaches and players
of the seventh-ranked Buckeyes football team know they
have a game Saturday.

“They are a team that is about two minutes from being
undefeated,” said head coach John Cooper at his weekly
press conference. .

“They are deﬁnitely one of the most improved teams
in the country. Our key is getting off to a good start. This
is our first true road game, so we have to play well and
not let the Pitt fans get into it.”-

The Buckeyes are coming off a 30-20 victory over the
University of Washington, which raised their record to 2-
0, but Cooper feels there is still much work to be done.

“Pittsburgh is a sound football team, but I am con-
cerned with Ohio State. We want to improve on things
we can control ourselves," said Cooper, who looks to
improve his record against the Panthers to 3-1 on
Saturday. B

Onearea of concern for the Buckeyes isthe kicking
team. - .

“Our kickoff and punt teams are great in practice. Josh
[Jackson] and Brent [Bartholomew] both have Big Ten
legs, but they try too hard, which can be overcome,”
Cooper said. ‘

The other area that will be worked on is defense,
specifically the tackling.

“The defense is at a point where I thought they would

~ ~ . \2'-‘ we

be,” said Cooper. “We will work on

attack angles and tackling.
Pittsburgh’s got some good skill peo-
ple.”

Cooper would like to keep the ball
in tailback Eddie George’s capable
hands. George became the ﬁrst back
in OSU history to rush for 200 yards
in a game three times, and now his
name has been thrown into the
Heisman Trophy running.

“I wasn’t very focused on the
Heisman Trophy coming into the sea-
son,” said George, a senior from
Philadelphia. “I’ve got to focus on
this week’s game and we’ll sort [the
Heisman] out after the Michigan
game.” -

Pittsburgh is coached by Johnny
Majors, now in his second stint with
the Panthers. He built the team into a
national power during the ‘70s and is
now in his third season trying it in the
‘90s.

“We were poor two years ago,”
said Majors, who played his college
football for the University of
Tennessee. “We would be out of the
game in the first half. Our goal is to
have a chance to win the football
game going into the fourth quarter.
We’re a better football team as far as

1993.

It all worked out in the end,
but when Ryan watched from
the sidelines, it was rough. So
rough that he thought about
transferring.

“It was something I thought
about, but I doubt that I would
have ever done it,” he said.

While Fitzgerald was given
the job in ‘94, the quarterback
situation was handled much dif-
ferently the year before. This
time around Ryan fought with
Ken Ferguson for the job.
Although Ryan started 10 of the
11 games his sophomore year, it
was a whole different ballgarne.

“When Ferguson or I went in,
we knew if we weren’t produc-
ing we would be pulled,” he
said. “It was a game—by-game
situation.”

Ryan conceded he didn’t
have a good year, throwing six
touchdowns and eight intercep-
tions, but as usual, the blame
erroneously fell on his shoul-
ders.

“It was discouraging to any-

one associated with Pitt. We
were struggling,’’ Ryan said.
“Everything was going wrong.”

But there's a different feel
this year —— everyone involved
with Pitt can feel it. However,
Ohio State visits Pitt Stadium
this weekend. Usually that
translates into a major Pitt
drubbing, but maybe not, if
Ryan can rebound from the
Texas game. Majors thinks he
will.

“He’s a tough kid,” Majors
said. “John Ryan doesn’t get
rattled. He’s not a soft—touch.
He’ll always bounce back. You
can mark that down.”

Already having thrown 760
yards this season, Ryan’s career
total is up to 3,655 yards, which
lands him fifth on Pitt’s all-time
list, and he only needs four
yards to pass Dave Havem for
fourth. Not bad for someone
who took up the position as a
freshman in high school
because he thought that he
wouldn’t get hit. 1

“I really enjoyed punting and

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 

 
 

 

kicking. As a freshman, that’s
all I really wanted to do,” said
the two-time Big East Scholar-
Athlete. “I didn’t want to play
receiver or defense and hit; I
didn’t like any of that. My mom
told me to go out for quarter-
back. She said I’ll be second-
string, I won’t play ever and I
won’t get hit.”

As a junior he won the start-
ing position at Boardman High
School and never looked back.
He went’ on to break school
records in yardage and touch-
downs, both of which were pre-
viously owned by former
Cleveland Brown great Bernie
Kosar.

Although Ryan has made his
mark in both high school and
college", he said he’s not the
type of guy who’s going to win

games. “I just have to put the

team in the right situation.”

The “right situation” is com-
ing this weekend, and a win
would make Pitt a legitimate
bowl contender. It would also
shut up Ryan’s naysayers.

Village
0From page 3

“It’s also fun. I have a good time out
here doing this.”

The Golden Panther Sports Village is a
great idea that might help Pitt put more
fans in the seats. There are, however, a
couple of problems.

The first thing that comes to mind is
that the Sports Village does not publicize
enough. There are no signs directing fans

to the Cost Center, nor are there ads in
the local papers. More than half of the
fans reading this article have probably
never heard of the Sports Village.

The Village seems to be situated in a
bad location. Students, for the most part,
do not know where the Cost Center is.
Even if students do know where it is,
they are not likely make the trip, just for

“way up the hill.” One suggestion might
be to change the location of the Sports
Village to a more student-accessible loca-
tion.

Most of the people in attendance before
the EMU game at‘ the Village were
parked in the Towerview Parking Garage.
This is the parking garage that is right
between the Cost Center and Pitt
Stadium. If the intention was to entertain

the fans parked in this lot, then thumbs
up, great job. If the intention was to
entertain all fans before a Pitt game well
then

The Golden Panther Sports Village is a
good idea, but alittle more publicity
would make it even better (PA. system at
Pitt games excluded). This is just another
example of Pitt turning a great idea into a

the past two years. No one was
happier when the Seahawks took
Galloway in the ﬁrst round of the
NFL draft this past April. Glenn
had seven catches for 91 yards
and one score last week against
the Huskies.

I still like Jells, and you can’t
vote anti-Durham. Advantage:
Pitt

Offensive Line — Matt
Hosilyk vs. Orlando Pace

At 6-4, 285, Hosilyk is a very
big man. At 6-6, 320, sophomore
Orlando Pace is a much bigger
man. Pace makes Dell Seagraves
look like the anti-huge.

Still only 19 years old, Pace
was the Big 10 Freshman of the
Year in ‘94. ‘Nuf said. Advantage:
OSU

Ohio State does have Pitt out-
matched on offense, but the key to
the game will be the defense. If
the Panthers can slow down the
OSU offense, they can stay in the
game. The most important point
will be to stop the big plays. In
turn, Pitt must be able to pull
something special out of its hat
this week

“How do the defenses stack
up?” you ask Let’s take a look

Linebackers — Tom Tumulty
vs. Greg Bellisari

So much has been said about
the talent of Tumulty.

So much has been said about
the talent of Bellisari.

Looks like we have a good old-
fashioned talent show. Advantage:
Push

Secondary — Anthony Dorsett
vs. Shawn Springs

Both of these men combine size
and speed to cause problems for
their opponents’ passing game,
but there is a bigger picture here.

Tum back the clock to the late
l970’s  Tony Dorsett wins the
Heisman and leads Pitt to the
National Championship. Rod
Springs is a star back at Ohio
State. Both have kids while still in
college, Anthony Jr. and Shawn,
respectively. The Dallas Cowboys
draft both of them (Tony and Rod,
not the kids).

Now their sons are starting at
their alma maters. Anthony
Dorsett gets the edge because
Tony is on the cool Burger King
cups. Advantage: Pitt

Special Teams — Solid vs.
Shaky

Chris Ferencik has been perfect
so far this season, 14-14 on extra
points and 4—4 ﬁeld goals. Nate
Cochran has punted 13 times and
has an impressive 40.8—yard aver-
age, including a 68-yarder against
Texas.

Ohio State’s Josh Jackson has
wonied coaches, especially last
week when he had an extra point
blocked. Punter Brent '
Bartholomew has a miserable
31.8 average in the ﬁrst two
games. OSU coach John Cooper
has also been concemed about

~Ten'y Glenn ﬁelding punts.

This is a solid area for the
Panthers, and that could make a
difference in a close game. This
will be a close game.

Jenkins has two more INTs.

Durham scores his ﬁrst career
TD.

Hoying is kept under wraps,
Eddie George isn’t.
