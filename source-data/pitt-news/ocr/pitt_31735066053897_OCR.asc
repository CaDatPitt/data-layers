October 12 marks an anniversary no one in
Pittsburgh will be celebrating. It will be the one-
year anniversary of the day Johnny Gammage
died while in police custody.

Today, lawyers are set to charge Baldwin

‘I Sgt. Keith Henderson and officer Shawn

evening, but they do/not face charges.
1 Speakers on the case gathered for an open

'1 night to discuss and vent anger over the case.
? The event was sponsored by the Campus

Mellon University and the Kuntu Repertory
T Theatre at Pitt. The discussion was one of several

“I have no problem with police in general. I

coroner’s inquest jury foreman Richard Lyons.
Lyons said the meeting Friday night was a
chance for the public to know what the jurors
knew so there wouldn’t be anymore wrong ideas
surrounding the case. .
He also urged members of the media to only
tell the public the facts of what happened on the

night Gammage was killed, not to let their person- V

al opinions obscure their duty as journalists.
“Some people say our decision was hasty. It

wasn’t. We were sequestered for three days. We _

had to hear and see the whole thing,” said Lyons.

The jury weighed testimony ﬁom over 30
police oﬁicers as well as ﬁorn Cyril Wecht,
Allegheny County coroner. Wecht, testifying on
the last day of the inquest, gave detailed descrip-
tions of Gaminage’s battered body.

Lyons, refening to Wecht’s statements, said
that they “sealed the decision on the case.”

Lyons went on to say that all ﬁve of the ofﬁ-

that night. -

“People forget that all Garnrnage did was tap

Facilities management
doesn't clump recyclables

6"‘ her ,.

   

- The recycling coordinator

for Pitt’s Facilities
Management Division has
introduced a new program to
guarantee that recyclable mate-
rials don’t end up in the
garbage dump.’

“I’ve met a lot of staff and
I’ve been a pain in the butt —

. but that’s kind of what you

have to do to sell a new pro-
gram,” said Greg Garvin, recy-
cling coordinator for facilities
management.

Garvin is talking about the
expanded. recycling program
instituted last February by
facilities management, which
handles maintenance functions
for every Pitt building except
student dormitories. Since then,
recyclable materials have been
picked up two days a week,
while regular refuse is collect-
ed on the other three.

“Our program has come a

long way in a year-and-a—half,”
said Garvin, who believes peo-
ple are recycling more now that
the process has been simplified
for them.

There are now two waste
containers in each staff and fac-
ulty office of the campus acad-
emic buildings. One is for plain
refuse, and the other is for
recyclable paper products.

Garvin attributes part of
this success to Browning Ferris
Industries (BFI), which became
Pitt’s new recycling company
about two years ago.

“They’re a company thor-
oughly committed to recy-
cling,” said Garvin.

The University’s recy-
clables were previously han-
dled by A. Phillips Hauling
Company. Garvin said that
unsubstantiated rumors about
this particular company mixing
the recyclables with refuse
caused an image problem with-
in the University community.

Trustees approve new degree to

increase GSP|A’s

Marc Nuzzo

 

Pitt trustees voted unanimously
Thursday to approve the addition of a
new degree type to the three existing
degrees currently offered by the
Graduate School of Public and
International Atfairs [GSPIA].

The Academic Affairs and
Library Committee of the Board of
Trustees introduced a Master of
Public Policy and Management
(MPPM) program to GSPIA. which
will provide a 30 credit hour curricu-

lum, as opposed to the 48 credit hours A

required by the other GSPIA degrees.

Two required courses in the cur-
riculum are a Foundation Seminar in
the ﬁrst semester of study, and a
Capstone Seminar to be taken near
the end of the program which will
combine what the student has learned
into one course.

competitiveness

Applicants will be limited to
those with ﬁve or more years in a
position of substantial managerial or
policy—maldng responsibility. 4

According to Kevin Keams,
associate dean of GSPIA, the pro-
gram is essentially “taking away the
element of core courses, which are
repetitive to the target student, and
giving credit for life experience.”

Keams said he hopes the new
program will improve GSPIA acade-
mically in relation to other graduate
schools. _

t ‘This will enhance not only our
competitive position, but will reiterate
the intellectual climate of GSP ,”
said Keams.

According to a report issued by
the committee, the degree program
was proposed in response to “consid-
erable competition from Carnegie

WASHINGTON — House and Senate
negotiators agreed to expand insurance cov-

mothers and their infants.

Republicans also yielded to President
Clinton’s demands for more domestic
spending for next year, hoping to avoid a
repeat of last year’s damaging budget ﬁghts.

The health care proposals will prohibit
insurance plans from establishing restrictive
lifetime or armual limits on coverage for
mental illness. It will also allow new moth-

WASHINGTON —- The House voted to
overturn President Clinton’s ﬁve—month-old
veto of legislation that would outlaw a late

The 285 to 137 vote — four votes more
than needed for the two-thirds majority
required —— was a symbolic victory for anti-
abortion forces because the Senate is unlike-
ly to muster a similar majority to enact the
measure into law. The Washington Post

GSPIA has been forced to consider

the report, has also occurred as part of “an

The school‘ projects an enrollment in the
MPPM program of 55 part time and six full-

According to Provost and Senior Vice

Those courses will be taught by concen-

According to Maher, a unique aspect of
the MPPM program is that it draws from the
instructors and resources which GSPIA
already has at its disposal.

“What the program does is utilize
GSPLA more efﬁciently with the resources it
already has.” said Maher.

The provost’s office has agreed to pro-
vide GSPIA a loan to fund the creation of this
program. This money is ' scheduled to be

the substantial costs of marketing the pro-

Piﬂ researcher clevelopes anti-terrorism technology 

Michel "Humes

      

Ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy is
as expensive and bulky as it sounds, but
a Pitt professor is researching the tech-
nique as the newest forrn of anti-terror-
ism.
“Using the Ultraviolet Raman that
way, we can detect small traces of
explosives that the human eye can’t
see,” said Calum Monro, professor of
forensic and analytical chemistry.

Monro has been using Ultraviolet
(UV) Raman to rapidly break down
molecules and give details about their
structures.

He said the device works by reﬂect-

ing light off substances, and that securi-
ty guards will be able to determine if
the substance is an explosive by the
color of the reﬂected light.

“From the differences in color [of
the UV ray on different substances] you
can extract information on the molecu-
lar structure of the material,” he said.

Monro is researching ways to use
UV Raman to detect traces of bomb
explosives at places like airports and
security posts in buildings and sports or
concert events.

Monro said the recent rash of
bombings at places like the Olympics
and the Federal Building in Oklahoma
City has increased the need for this type
of research, but he stressed that it is a

very slow and detailed process.

Monro’s current goal in the devel-
opment of this technology is to reduce
the size of the equipment for the UV
Raman spectroscopy to the size of a
backpack so security officials will be
able to walk around and scan products
with a rod for traces of explosives.

Monro said the laser that detects the
substances wouldn’t be able to probe
into the luggage, but it wouldn’t have to
because the PETN could be traced on
the outside of the luggage.

The explosive substance Monro is
interested in detecting is PETN, or pen-
taerythritol tetranitrate, a chemical that
terrorists commonly use in bombs.

PETN is a white, granular powder

that adheres to things such as fingertips
and luggage rather easily. UV Raman is
able to detect mere microns of PETN on
objects in as little time as five seconds,
a. significant concept considering that
1,000 microns measures only one rni1—
limeter.

Monro said the UV Raman will
allow authorities to follow trails of an
explosive material to the people who
planted the bomb and to the bomb itself.

Monro said he is also researching
the use of UV Raman in detecting small
traces of drugs, which would help
police and customs officials prevent
drugs from getting through airports and
security areas.

Another goal is to lower the cost of
the equipment and make it affordable so
it can be used around the world.

“I would like to make UV Raman
accessible to every laboratory in the
world. At the moment, the cost aspect
of the device prevents this,” Monro
said.

If correctly applied, UV Raman can
be used to study an inﬁnite number of
things. Monro said other scientists are
using UV Raman to study biological
molecules to learn about protein folding
and structure.

“There is so much we don’t under-
stand about the body. UV Raman helps
us understand more about the body’s
functions and processes,” Monro said.

Monro also said each breakthrough
with the spectroscopy unit opens a door
to more research.

“We’re trying to take UV Raman
from just research and applying it to
solve industrial problems and for phar-
macy use. You do research in one area,
and it can benefit other areas,” he said.

“Verbocentrism.”

You may be trying to ﬁgure out what
that word means, but by simply reading it
the meaning may not be automatically clear.
That is an example of why Professor Doug
Hartman is researching new methods of
education.

Verbocentrism is the method of teach-
ing through written materials which most of
us experienced in elementary and high
schools. It is a cheaper, easier method of
teaching for schools with tight budgets, but
Hartman has discovered that many students
have trouble learning with this method.

Hartman, professor of language and lit-
erature in Pitt’s School of Education, recent-
ly received a fellowship ﬁorn the National
Academy of Education to study students
who have diﬁculty learning by the verbo-
centric teaching method.

Hartman focuses his research around -

minority students, primarily African-
Americans in high school, though he said
many other types of students have diﬂiculty
with the “verbocentric” teaching method.

Early in his career, Hartman taught at
schools in areas ranging from rural Oregon
to urban California. He said teaching such a
variety of students helped him understand
how different classroom techniques have
more meaning to some students than to oth-
ers.

“The methods ﬂiat were so robust in
teaching students to comprehend, compose,
and use texts in rural Oregon lacked power
and relevance in urban California,” Hartman

Haywood Jones, a coroner jurist, and
Paul Gettleman, a local attorney, also spoke.
Jones said that there are still “too many
lies” surrounding this case and “unless all
ﬁve oﬂicers are convicted, the truth won’t

said.

Because students with diﬁerent cultural
backgrounds have difficulties interpreting
“mainstream” or traditional styles of teach-
ing, Hartman said he hopes to customize
methods of teaching according to student
cultures.

Hartman has researched how some stu-
dents respond to texts such as music and art,
and found they have a much more sigriiﬁ—
cant impact on students than written texts
but aren’t used often enough in the class-
room. .

“’Ihe full range of textual practices that
many students develop and use outside of
school are often not employed in the class-
room,” said Hartman. '

Hartman has researched the interaction

of high-school Aﬁican—American males
with various types of art and music. He has
also studied how they communicate social-
ly, and how they instruct each other in order
to see how they might best respond to
instruction ﬁorn others.

For the past year, Hartman has been fol-
lowing two Aﬁican—American high school
males and observing their daily interactions
with “text” (including notes written to girl-
ﬁiends during lunch hour or maps for get-
ting to a local hangout after school).

He said he hopes this research will help
him develop teaching methods that cater to
the special needs of such students. He said

he wants to adapt this method through ﬁlms, 8

computer programs, music, and other class-
room mediums.

Hartman said his research can beneﬁt
the students of Pitt’s School of Education,
who are mostly female, rniddle—class, and
English—speal<ing, towards new teaching
approaches.

He said this change will be necessary
because future students, will be “more het-
erogeneous  a mix of socioeconomic sta-
tus.”

Hartman said that even though his
research is speciﬁcally centered around
high-school Aﬁican—American males, he

V says his research can “work across the age

levels,” even for university—level students.

In the future, Professor Hartman’s
research can help the general Pitt students,
those who may be struggling with instruc-
tion that uses a “verbocentric” method.

”Rock the Vote” rolls onto Pitt campus Tuesday

 

You might be surprised to hear that
out of 16,000 Pitt undergraduates only
3,000 were registered to vote last year.

You might be even more surprised
to hear that only 17 of those 3,000 stu-
dents bothered voting in the elections.

These statistics, released by the
Student Government Board, prompted
them to invite MTV’s “Choose or Lose
Bus” to the William Pitt Union on
Tuesday in the hopes of inspiring more
students to register and vote.

“It is not surprising that this age
group, particularly college students, do

not have any candidates look their
way,” said Shanna Blau, chair of voter
registration for Pitt. “We really did not
give a reason for candidates to come to
our campus, however if we get enough
students to register we can ‘rock the
vote.”’

MTV and “Rock the Vote” have
come together in an attempt to register
as many students to vote as possible so
that the student vote will not be over-
looked.

“Rock the Vote” was founded in
1990 as a nonproﬁt organization by
recording artists. “Rock the Vote”
became the response to attacks on free-
dom of speech and artistic expression

and to the results from the 1988 elec-
tion, in which the young voter turnout
hit an all-time low. '

In the 1992 presidential election, 43
percent of young voters participated in
the election. This increase inspired
“Rock the Vote” to become even more
motivated to make a difference in the
1996 presidential election.

“We’re developing campus-orient-
ed programs, we’re continuing the PSA
campaign, we’re going to television and
radio this year and we’ll have a website
on the Internet at
www.rockthevote.org,” said MTV’s
Executive Director Ricki Seidman.

Since “Rock the Vote” was found-

ed, it has registered over one million
young people to vote. The organization
has also been active in fighting censor-
ship laws that would stop anyone under
the age of 17 from buying a CD with a
parental advisory sticker.

“I think ‘Rock the Vote’ is doing a

great job. The amount of youth voter ’

registration since 1992 has risen
tremendously,” said Blau. “If we could
just get everyone to vote after being
registered that would be our greatest
accomplishment.”

In 1996, the SGB also enacted a
registration program called Pitt Vote.
SGB’s goal is to educate and register
students to vote here in Pittsburgh so
that they won’t have to go through the
process of absentee voting.

“In order to vote, a student just,

needs to fill out the registration form.
Pitt Vote will do the rest of the wor ,”
said Blau. “After registering students
will get a reminder in the mail to vote,
it is that easy.”

So far, 500 students on campus
have been registered, and this figure is
projected to grow as the weeks
progress. The last day to register for the
presidential elections is Oct. 5. The
people at Pitt Vote and “Rock the Vote”
will continue registering students on
campus until that date.

“The response on campus has been
great. Many other organizations are
helping out in our cause,” said Blau.
‘‘We’ll just have to see the outcome on
election day to know if we reached
young voters.”

The fact that A. Phillips Hauling

was primarily a refuse company was

another factor promoting the switch

to BFI, which- is the one of the largest
recyclers in the country. (

Garvin said that any mixing that
took place when the refuse company
hauled the recyclables doesn’t hap-
pen anymore.

Part of the expansion of’ recy-
cling services included purchasing
165 containers for recyclable materi-
als at a cost of about $10,000. Garvin
said the containers not only prevent
the recyclable paper from getting
wet, but also help discourage the
belief that the recyclables are being
thrown away with the other refuse.

In addition, facilities manage-
ment is now purchasing facial and
toilet tissue made from 100-percent
recycled paper.

But the recycling success Garvin
talked about in the University’s acad-
emic buildings is not as prevalent in

. the residence halls.

“Right now, our program is not
terribly successful,” said Housing
DirectorBob Hopkins.

The main problem, according to
Hopkins, is that food stuffs are often

0 thrown in the recycling containers,
which contaminate the recyclables.

Hopkins said that an added chal-
lenge of housing recycling is the
turnover of the resident population
each year.

She's a dedicated follower of fashion

 

Continuing on the topic of the
Netherlands, I’m going to discuss dif-
ferences of appearance between the
people of Holland and those of il’lC
U.S. But three things must be under-
stood before I go any further. First of
all, I am not including Amsterdam in
this comparison, since it exists as a
sort of mir1i—country within the
Netherlands. Second of all, I’m gener-
alizing based on personal observation;
I’m not assuming any of the following
to be the absolute truth, and neither
should you. Lastly, I’m writing about
daily wear to school (that means
excluding situations like going out to
clubs or whatever).

So with that in mind, I’ll start my
comparison. Three physical differ-
ences between Dutch and Americans
came to my attention. As all my
friends know, since it’s my favorite
statistic, the Dutch people are the
tallest in the world except for one tribe
in Kenya whose name I cannot
remember. This may seem like trivia,
but it makes a huge difference. Beds
are long enough, showers high
enough, pants and sleeves long
enough, bus seats far enough apart,
and heels become possible to wear
without feeling like a towering giant.

Besides simply height, there is a
certain Dutch body type that is identi-
ﬁable as such. What I mean is that
there are Dutch physical (especially
facial) features that predominate.
Basically, Holland is full of Dutch-
looking people. On the surface that
may seem like a silly, obvious state-
ment. But it’s not when seen from the
perspective of the U.S. After all, what

does a U.S citizen look like? With a
huge range of ethnic backgrounds,
there is really no physical type that is
very predominant. I am not saying
there is only one “Dutch” type, just
that there is more ethnic homogeny.
The third physical characteristic
actually belongs more to the realm of
fashion, but since it has to do with a
part of the body, I’ll just consider it to
be a physical feature. It’s in the nails.
It appears to me that the phenomena
of long nails, either painted or plain, is
distinctly American. I might have

- seen a couple of females withpainted

nails in Holland, but I don’t remember
ever having seen long nails. In addi-
tion, I got plenty of comments on my
nails, although I don’t think they are
particularly long.

Passing over now deﬁnitely into
the world of fashion, I noticed some
glaring differences. Most of these
became clear to me upon my retum to
Pitt. Therefore these observations can
be considered to be more between the
University of Utrecht and Pitt than
between Holland and the U.S. To
make this topic manageable for this
article, I’ll make some generalizations
about male and female fashion trends
at Utrecht and at Pitt.

Dutch female students tended to
wear either short, tight tops or long,
loose ones. Pants were tight and
ended just above the ankle —usually
jeans or a lycra/cotton mix. Leather,
plastic, and satin pants were also “in”
while I was there. Small, light scarves
were often worn knotted at the neck.
Shoes were dark and generally high-
heeled. Platform shoes were not
uncommon. Dutch male students
wore monochrome T-shirts under but-
ton-down shirts tucked into either reg-

ular ﬁt jeans or slacks. Dress shoes or
boots (anything like Docs or combat
boots) were the choice for shoes.
Sneakers were worn by both sexes
only for sport, never to go to class.
Dutch students tend to dress less casu-
ally than American ones. I didn’t real-
ly notice any particular trends in jew-
elry, which I mention because it
seems the hemp with beads necklace
seems to have taken over here. .

I have to say, though, that the
greatest single fashion trend that I
noticed on my return was one that’s
nmning opposite the trend in Holland.
Whereas the clothes there are leaning
towards body—hugging, here they are
going for body-enveloping._ I mean,
what’s up with huge pants? They
seem to have invaded. This trend also
seems different from the one in the
Netherlands because it’s much more
unisex. In Utrecht, male and female
students couldn’t switch outﬁts. Here,
they could. Now, I’m not saying
everyone; I’m saying with the trend to
large clothing, it’s possible. Shoes
here are very different as well, apart
from the sneakers I aheady men-
tioned. Shoes are more unisex here as
well, being Birkenstock—ish or Teva—
ish sandals or Purna-ish or Airwalk—
ish trainers. Another fashion trend that
remains American is the baseball cap,
especially when worn backwards.

So in conclusion, I have no con-
clusion. Do what you will with the
above observations. Just understand
that just as not everyone here is walk-
ing around in oversized pants, nor is
everyone in Holland wearing ﬁgure-
hugging clothes.

campus watching fashion trends

Is the death penalty a
fair retribution or a
crime in and of itself?

I’m writing in response
to Jason Gallinger’s
polemic about the death
penalty in Wednesday’s Pitt
News. Obviously he has
strong opinions on the
issue, but he doesn’t know
the facts...

Mr. Gallinger says the
death penalty is the only
punishment for murderers.
It’s arbitrary to single out
murderers and not other
criminals for a sentence

precisely the
crime.

Mr. Gallinger says that
it is expensive to keep pris-
oners in jail. It is, but it’s
far more expensive to exe-
cute them. According to the
Los Angeles Law Review in
1989, “The death penalty is
not now, nor has it ever
been, a more economical
alternative to life imprison-
ment.” According to the
Miami Herald on July 10,
1988, it’s approximately six
times asexpensive to exe-
cute a prisoner in Florida as
it is to keep him alive for
life...

The appeals process is
expensive but necessary.
The concept of the death
penalty intrinsically denies
due process because once a
person is dead there can be
no appeal or reprieve in
case of‘ new evidence. The
appeals process is designed
to set the record straight if a
prisoner is indeed inno-
cent...

He says the death penal-
ty is not an effective deter-
rent because it isn’t taken
seriously. It’s clear that it is
not an effective deterrent.
Increasing the amount of
executions would not
change this.

Mr. Gallinger limits an
accused criminal’s right to
“a fair trial by a jury with
good legal representation.”
Death Row inmates are
overwhelmingly lower
class. Most — approximate-
ly 90 percent — could not
afford a lawyer at their tri-
als...

The problem with the
death penalty is, as Sister
Helen Prejan said, “The
most profound moral ques-
tion is not, ‘Do they
deserve to die?’ but ‘Do we
deserve to kill them?”’

We have one month
of a closed Bigelow —
make the most of it

A test in September?
No, it’s not mid—terms yet,
but we are in the middle of
a huge test. If we don’t pass
the Bigelow Boulevard test
this month then we may see
our campus cut in half once
again.

Contrary to popular
opinion, the closing of
Bigelow is n_ot a safety
issue. It’s not about Pitt stu-
dents being battered, but
rather about us being bul-
lied by cars. Pitt students
c_an look both ways before
crossing, even though
Councilman Dan Cohen
doesn’t think we are smart
enough. However, we
should not have to be
chased down by cars. when
we try to get from one side
of campus to the other dur-
ing a 10-minute break in
between classes.

This month is an oppor-
tunity for all members of
the University to come
together and claim our
Campus. Campus with a big
‘C’ because finally we have

a chance to earn one. After
decades of being split by a
busy throughway, we are on
the verge of campus unity.

Make this month count.
- Have a conversation on
the way to class.

- Relax. There are no two-
ton metal giants chasing
you down.

- Relish the quiet. Relish
the smog—free air.

0 Have the next pep rally on
Bigelow.

- Play the guitar. Juggle.

- Enjoy your campus.

The most important
thing to do is to be loud.
Share your feelings about a
united campus with the peo-
ple around you. Make sure
that you take a few minutes
and tell City Planning how
great the new student
throughway is. In fact, if
you really care about your
school, then you will write
a quick note to the city of
Pittsburgh and drop it off in
the Student Government
office (639 WPU). SGB
will hand—carry all letters
pertaining to Bigelow
Boulevard to the City

Planning office to make
sure that our voices are
heard.

A student takes
offense at p.r. taylor’s
column on abortion.

Regarding p.r. taylor’s
“A funny thing happened on
the way to the abortion
clinic”: Moral idiocy has
once again struck the pages
of the Pitt News. Ms. tay-
lor’s tantrum at having
viewed the insertion “She’s
a Child, Not a Choice” is
typical of many young peo-
ple today. Let me offer one
reason she probably was
annoyed at having seen it:
The insertion most likely
tugged at any pangs of
moral sensibility left in her.
To be confronted with
moral dilemmas is very
annoying to those on the
secular Left these days.

That taylor would char-
acterize abortion as merely
“a woman doing what she
wants with her body” is tan-
tamount to comparing a
fetus to a decayed tooth. No

one would question if a
woman wanted to remove a
decayed tooth. Why?
Because a woman can do
whatever she wants with
her body. I would think that
even Ms. taylor would not
go so far as to compare a
fetus to a decayed tooth.

By the way, I’m techni-
cally pro—choice. I do not
believe abortion to be the
moral equivalent of murder.
But at least I can under-
stand the moral dilemmas
of abortion. It’s not murder,
but it’s something.

Finally, I would suggest
taylor take a trip to the
Holocaust museum in
Washington, D.C. Maybe
she’ll be lucky enough to
meet a survivor. Then she
can ask the survivor if
he/she thinks that the pro-
life movement’s premises
are (in her words) “Nazi-
like.” To make an analogy
between the monsters who
gassed Jews and often times
burned them alive, and
those in the pro—life move-
ment, is, simply disgusting.
She ought to be ashamed of
herself.

Yes, Ms. taylor, the
uteris is a body part,
but a. fetus isn't

This is my rebuttal to
Ms. p.r. taylor and her crazy
view of the abortion issue.
She started her editorial on
Wednesday, Sept. 18 stating
that she learned that the
uterus is a part of the
woman’s body. Your body
belongs to you and you may
do whatever you like with
your body, but when one is
pregnant, it is the mother’s
responsibility to care for
the other BODY  And
what does abortion have to
do with gun control?
Abortion is totally different
from gun control, except
that they both have to do
with murder. I do not even
have a clue about where the
drug control issue comes
from. Maybe our friend Ms.
taylor is on crack or some
derivative of it. I am not

Majors: ”Not as
good as |astyear”

Mike Kovak

 

When things are at their worst,
optimists say things can only get better.

Pessimists say things will only
continue to spiral downward.

Whether your glass is half-full or
half-empty, Pitt has reached rock bottom
after Ohio State humiliated them 72-0

The Buckeyes have had a runner reach
the 100-yard plateau in 14 consecutive
games. ’

Pitt managed to cross midﬁeld only
once in the game, courtesy of a 32-yard
run by Billy West, who carried the ball
only nine times for 63 yards.

Unlike the Buckeyes’ season open-
ing 70-7 throttling of Rice, Pitt players
and coaches could not complain about

  

Last season, Pitt went 2-9. This
season, Pitt is 1-3. Saturday’s loss is the

most lopsided margin of defeat in school
history.

The Buckeyes dominated every.

aspect of the contest. Ohio State scored
on their first 10 possessions, nine touch-
downs and one ﬁeld goal. Running back
Pepe Pearson, who amassed 103 yards,
and freshman David Boston scored
three TDs each. Tailback ' Joe
Montgomery, OSU’s third-stringer led
the Buckeyes with 109 yards rushing.

right defensive end Jason Chavis, and
super—sub running back Dwayne
Schulters. In addition, punter Nate
Cochran punted with an injured leg.
That’s just part of the reason Pitt
converted one of 11 third downs, man-
aged one first-half first down (four for
the entire game). Pitt rushed for nega-
tive yards until late in the third quarter
and finished with 77. Starting quarter-
back Matt Lytle looked shakier Saturday
then he did against West Virginia, com-

Stupid penalties can
really hurt any sports team,
as the men’s soccer team
found out in their 2-0 loss
to the University of
Connecticut yesterday.

“We missed our early
chances to score, and that
came back to haunt us,”
Coach Joe Luxbacher said.

The 25th-ranked
Huskies capitalized on two
Panther penalties by Travis
Kruse in.the second half of
the game to capture their
fifth win. The Panthers
have lost three straight Big
East games, falling to 2-3-1
(0-3-1) overall.

The first half of the
contest was highly aggres-
sive and control changed
hands frequently, resulting
in a scoreless half. After the
half, both teams "came out
determined to score. Pitt

had several scoring

attempts, but all were either
botched or blocked. Finally,
after a long afternoon of
hearing the referee’s whis-
tle, Kruse was slapped with
a yellow card when ’ he
pushed a UConn player to
the ground. UConn then
answered on the penalty
kick, scoring at the 69:12
mark.

Pitt tried to regroup,
firing several more shots,
but none of them entered
the goal.

“Our guys played hard,
but we haven’t found any-
one to score goals yet,”
Luxbacher said. “If we
could have stuck in the
early goals, it would have
been different.”

With only a minute left,
Kruse was given a red card
for his second pushing
offense and had to leave the
game. UConn then scored
again on a penalty kick at
90:00. Kruse will miss this
Saturday’s garn"e»against“,,thc.‘

St. John’s Red Flash, a con-
ference powerhouse,
because of the red card.
Penalties have been a
problem for the Panthers
this season. Mike Dyer, a
senior marking back,
received a red card during
the SUNY-Buffalo game,
which forced him to miss

Pitt’s Big East opener
against Providence.
Drew" Kopp also

received a yellow card dur-
ing the UConn game for
fighting with a player.

“No one feels sorry- on
this team,” Luxbacher said
of his team’s morale. “The
season is a marathon, and
there will be ups and
downs. Perseverance is
what it takes to finish the
marathon.”

Just how embarrassing are we going to gel?

  

embarrassed

Every0ne’s been
before, but...

Remember the time when you did
those 21 shots and accidentally peed
your pants on your way to the bath-
room or puked in front of McDonald’s?

Or how about that time you were
cited, for underage drinking by Pitt
Police behind a bus stop with your
underwear down, exposing your geni-
talia on Allequippa Street?

The latter may not occur as often,
but it’s still embarrassing.

Where were the Pitt Police on
Saturday as the Panthers forgot to play
against the Ohio State Buckeyes, losing
72-0, Pitt’s most lopsided defeat in
school history?

We could dissect every embarrass-

ing aspect of that game (which we‘

will), we can complain about it (which
we will), we can contemplate how Pitt
went from the nation’s most dominant
program in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s
to the pathetic excuse of a Division I
squad that they are now (which we
will), and we can hide our heads and be
ashamed that we’ll refer to Pitt as our

alma mater one day (a cowardly act,-

but quickly becoming the only option).
To top off the embarrassment,

A which has swelled to epic proportions,

television has taken up mocking Pitt,
making us the laughing stock of the
nation. ESPN referred to the contest as
“Tyson versus Seldon.” If your boxing
knowledge is cloudy, Mike Tyson is the
man with an uppercut from hell and a
cute little lisp. Bruce Seldon was the
man Tyson last fought. His glass chin
shattered from Tyson’s breath.

NBC’s NFL pregame program cyn-
ically took their shots at one of college
football’s worst programs. Studio ana-
lyst Cris Collinsworth, a former all-pro
receiver, teased Mike Ditka, a former
Pitt alumnus who would have killed
everybody associated with Saturday’s
game had he been in Columbus, about
those Pitt Panthers. An uncontrollable
laugh emerged from everyone at the
NBC NFL studio, except for Ditka,
Why? He’s embarrassed.

This loss was as embarrassing as
the time when that note you wrote to

you got the courage to give it her. It
was possibly more embarrassing than
emerging from a public swimming pool
only to find that your trunks are still
ﬂoating somewhere in the deep end.

This was the largest margin of
defeat in Pitt’s history. Through all the
horrible teams this school has produced
in the past, this is the lowest moment.
On national television, Pitt lost 72-0,
and the score could have been 94-0. We
owe OSU Coach John Cooper a big
“thank you.”

After receiving scrutiny from Rice
University following a 70-7 victory,
Cooper vowed that he would not
attempt to run up a score again. During
the Pitt game, ESPN sideline cameras
spied on Cooper. They let the viewing

audience know that the Buckeyes

Pepe Pearson also tore apart the

said it must have been incredibly

Withrow, and senior Bryan Matusic are
expected to lead this year’s squad.
Matusic is a three-time national qualiﬁ-
er, while Withrow and Bodo are All-
Americans. In_all, the team returns 14
lettermen, including seven starters.

“This team has a lot of talent,” said
junior Larry Spercher. “But even more
impressive than the talent is the team’s
character.”

While formal
practices have yet

must participate in
mandatory condi-
tioning sessions
four times a week.
Their ‘work ethic
shines through at
night, when ‘nearly
everyone on the
team voluntarily
wrestles in infor-
mal practices.

As high as the expectations are for
the 1996-97 season, expectations are
even higher for future seasons. This
year’s recruiting class was ranked as the
10th best in the nation, according to
Amateur Wrestling News. (Penn State
was ranked 12th.)

“Our staff, particularly Coach Dan
Payne did an excellent job of signing

some top scholastic prospects from our
home state as well as Ohio and New
York,” said Coach Stottlemyer. “We
believe these young men ‘will impact
our program over the next four or ﬁve
years.” .

The Panthers may decide to redshirt
many of their freshmen in order to
stock up for the future. But freshman
Rob Loper, a high school Pa. state
champ, and Nick
Mengerink of Ohio,
rated second in the
nation at 145
pounds, may earn
starting spots this
season.

to have an impact
this season include
recruits Eric Pizzi, a
Pa. high school
champion, and
heavyweight Matt Mueller. Returning
grapplers include junior Jacob Schaus,
transfer Kevin Johnson, and. redshirt
sophomores Brian Pardini and Chad
Jesko. .

The Panthers will begin competing
in open tournaments in late November.
Their first dual meet is at home versus
Bloomsburg on Nov. 26.

gram used three ineligible players. The
third player’s name was blacked out in

bered as the most embarrassing in Pitt
history, OSU’s punt team, as ESPN
radio pointed out, had only eight men
on the field.

Eight men. Pitt had 11 guys on
the field; the Buckeyes had eight and
made the touchdown return look easy.
Maybe in the future, Pitt could barter
with teams, asking them to only play
seven players at a time, thus giving
our boys a better shot at the Miarnis
and Notre Dames, programs far supe-
rior to ours. .

Even though the Panthers are a
bad team, this loss shocked the coun-
try. It shows the disparity between
teams like Ohio State, teams that con-

tend annually for a national champi!

onship, and Pitt, teams that have some
talent but can never win games that
are of importance.

Know what else is embarrassing?

the game. They only got one in the
first half. Ohio State had 29 first

The Pitt offense- embarrassed

themselves by only entering Ohio
State territory once in the game,
thanks to a Billy West run. If you put
Pitt’s end zone at the 50-yard line, the
score would have been a lot closer,

The Pitt defense embarrassed
themselves by allowing nine touch-
downs during Ohio State’s first 10

pleting three of 10 passes for 22 yards.
Backup Pete Gonzalez, who might start
this weekend against Miami, went four

of eight for 21 yards and an interception. -

Majors might pull a few rabbits out
of his hat dealing with the quarterback
situation, including ditching plans to
redshirt heralded freshman Tony
Zimmerman. _

“I would consider virtually any
option this year,” Majors said.

It didn’ttake long for Ohio State’s
top—ranked offense to consider tearing
Pitt’s defense apart. Following two long
third down conversions, including a 22-
yard Stanley Jackson to DJ Jones con-
nection, Pearson scored his ﬁrst touch-

down of the game from 16 yards out,
shedding several poor attempts by the
Panther defense to tackle him. Pearson
broke ﬁve potential Pitt tackles on the
play.

After Cochran let a punt snap slip
through his hands on the ensuing pos-
session, the Buckeyes had the ball, ﬁrst-
and—goal at the Pitt 10-yard line. On sec-
ond down, Pearson scored from nine
yards out and Ohio State led Pitt 14-0
with 8:03 left in the first quarter.

The route was on.

The Ohio State quarterback tandem
of Jackson, who has led his offense to 10
touchdowns in his first 10 collegiate
series, and Joe Germaine combined to

THE PI'I"I' NES

 

complete 14 of 17 passes for 233 yards
and three TDs. This all occurred before
halftime, which saw Pitt trail 52-0.

“It didn’t matter who they put in
there;” Pitt strong safety Curtis McGhee
said, “they just kept going.”

The Buckeye offense kept going in
the second half, despite Coach John
Cooper’s attempts to keep the score
under control. Ohio State did not throw
the ball in the second half. ‘

After Ohio State made it 65-0 on
fullback Matt Keller’s 22-yard burst
through the gut of Pitt’s defense with
4:09 left in the game, it appeared as if
Pitt could hold on and avoid suffering
the worst defeat in school history, which

 
 

 FROM PAGE 11 

 

had previously been 69-0 losses to
Michigan and Notre Dame. -

That’s when the one of the most
embarrassing plays in the history of col-
lege football occurred. As Cochran punt-
ed for the eighth time, Ohio State’s
Boston was back to receive. Boston
ﬁelded the punt at the OSU 33-yard line
and proceeded to return the kick for a
67-yard touchdown. The Buckeyes had
eight men on the ﬁeld.

Pitt’s defense yielded 602 yards of

total offense as the Buckeyes controlled ~

the ball for 40:10. Pitt gained 120 yards
total offense, but was penalized only
three times for 16 yards. The Buckeyes
were ﬂagged ﬁve times for 60 yards.
