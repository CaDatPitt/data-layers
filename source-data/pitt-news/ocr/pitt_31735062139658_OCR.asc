Tippetts Meets
Bus Ad Students

Cultural Objective Of School
Emphasized By New Dean

 

“OuI' object in graduating students
from the School of Business Adminis-
tration is still primarily cultural,” said
Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, new dean of
the school, in an address before a
general assembly of Business Admin-
istration students Friday in the ban--
quet room of Memorial hall.

Meeting the students for the ﬁrst
time publicly, Dr. Tippetts explained
that the administration wished to
turn out graduates “not merely pro-
ﬁcient in money making, but also use-
ful from a. social and public point of
view.” _ , _

“Business ’states1nanship,” he said,
“is much more important right now
than business technique or skill. Our
students must learn the social im-
plications of their professions.” '

The new dean expressed‘ his happ-i-
ness at seeing so many women in the
school. He foresees great possibil-
ities for them in this ﬁeld. ,

In reviewing the history of busi-
ness schools, Dr. Tippetts told of the
ﬁrst recommendation‘ for a business
course in VVashington university prof-
fered by Robert E. Lee in 1869. In
1908 the University School of Busi-
ness Administration was established,
one of the first ten. At present there
are 80,000 business schools, the Uni-
versity school ranking among the ﬁrst
12 in size.

The dean was introduced by Dr.
Marion K. McKay, professor of eco-
nomics.

The assembly was arranged by
Montford Jones, professor of ﬁnance
and acting dean before Dr. Tippetts
assumed office. ‘ ‘

M 0 st Educators

Laugh Off Hearst,
Dean Prall Says

 

Teachers Disagree On Difference
Between Collective Economy,
Presenting All Sides

“Most educators are inclined to
laugh off William Randolph Heart's
shouting campaign,” said Dr. Charles
E. Prall, dean of the School of Educa-
tion, who returned last week from the
National Education Association con-
vention i11 Atlantic City.» The con-
vention caused much comment in the
newspapers because of the recent
criticism of radicalism to which the
schools and colleges of the country
have been subjected.

“The cry of sedition,” fDr. Prall
continued, “is that of a. special group.
In the schools, at least, we are not
.\-‘et at the stage where we point at
the ‘left-wingers’ as we pointed» at the
‘pro-German’ during the war.”

“The real issue among educators,”
he said, “is between the group who be-
lieve that we are about to move into
a collective economy, and that teach-
ers should interpret the current
scene accordingly; and the »group
who feel more doubtful of the direc-
tion in which we are moving and who
believe that the teache1"s work
should be the presentation of all
sides of the question without inter-
preting or predicting.”

Dr. William A. Yeager, professor
of education, who also attended the
convention, said: “In my opinion, the
feeling among educators is that the
public schools must examine critic-
ally the aims, purposes and curricu-
lar offerings in the light of the pres-
ent social, political and economic
changes everywhere apparent, There
must be a closer tie—up of the schools
with -the social order."

Other topics considered by the con-
vention were the problems of stats
and federal support of education, and
consolidation of educationl adminis-
trative units.

Among themembers .of the School
of Education faculty who attended
the meetings are Dr. C. A. Buckner,
professor of education; Dr. G. A.
Yoakam, professor of education; and

Dr. R. V. Young, associate professor_.

Kelly To Select
‘Chorines’ Tonight

Viehman Interviewing Applicants
For Leading Roles In Show

Gene 'Kelly,‘- dance director -- of Cap
and Gown, will draw the deciding line
for “In the Soup’s" beef trust chorus
at tonight's rehearsal scheduled for
8:30 o’clock at the Y hut. All men
who are eligible to compete in the
ﬁnal eliminations must have a pro-
ﬁcient dancing knowledge of all the
dance steps demonstrated to date.

The prospective chorines were given
a lay-oif from practice work over the
week-end in which to recover from
sore muscles, strained backs and blis-
tered soles.

Theodore Viehman, scenario and
general director of the show, is more
than satisﬁed with its progress to
date. He has been interviewing ap-
plicants for the cast since last Wed-
nesday and will make his ﬁnal choices
for principal players within the next
three days. In a statement made in
Friday’s castings. he said:

“I have, at present, enough good
material from which to draw a star
cast. I am, however. giving all ap-
plicants at least two chances to show
their proﬁciency as dancing vocalists
or actors. I have not made any cuts
as yet a.nd ﬁndit rather hard to do
as I have many good performers on
hand. The talent exhibited by the
applicants augurs well for a hit show."

Russ Connolly, Jack Wyeth, Charles
Gollmar, Jack Hammerschmidt, Harry
Boyd and Richard Orhlare among last
year’s stars who are out for the cast.

There will be a tryout for the octet
on Vvednesday, between 4 and 6
o’clock. in Room 1001, Cathedral.

Prediction Crown Goes To Seidle
After ‘Pledging’ Bull’s Eye Shot

The next time you intend playing
the ponies, buying a lottery ticket or
booking some clearing house num-

bers, consult N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men and fra-
ternity adviser, for a sure-ﬁre tip.

S-aidle’s prediction on the number
of men that would be pledged by the
men’s fraternities hit the results right
smack on the nose, the first prediction
ever made by the ofﬁce of assistant to
the dean of men to click with the
actual results. Mr. Seidle's prediction
was that 35 men would accept frater-
nity invitations and sure enough, at
5 o‘clock, VVednesday. when silence
period ofﬁcially ended, 35 men had
signiﬁed their intention of pledging to
one of the Greek societies.

This was Mr. Seidle’s second pre-

diction, his ﬁrst one, which was made
last October for the first semester
rush, missing the results by the long-
est shot ever. recorded in fraternity
forecasts. Mr. Seidle, in a statement
to the News at that time, said:

“From now on we’ll get authorities
to do the forecasting. My guess, he-
sides being ’way off, cost me a box of
candy.”

Concerning the candy episode, Mr.
Seidle had made a bet with Miss Alice
Beatty, his secretary. that he would
outguess her in predicting the rush-
ing results. If he won, Miss Beatty
was to forfeit a box of cigars. Miss
Beatty’s guess as to the number of
men that would be bid by the Greeks
was 60 per cent closer ;than Mr.
Seidle’s, whose forecast was off by 80
men.

Third SFA News
Show Scheduled

Revived Motion Picture Project
To Be Given Wednesday

W“itl1out applying artiﬁcial respira-
tion, injecting adrenalin, or using a
teeter board, Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant dean of men, resuscitated the
SFA newsreel after it had been de-
clared dead by the SFA committee
sponsoring the project.

Although Mr. Biddle and Charles
Herald, C36, chairman of the com-
mittee, had decided to discontinue

showing of the newsreel because of
the expense involved, further negotia-
tions with Vvarner Brothers ofﬁcials

~have‘en'ab1ed them to continue it for

another week. “The third presentat-
tion of the ﬁlms, at the Schenley the-
ater this Wednesday," Mr. Biddle ex-
plained, “will be in the nature" of a.
ﬁnal experiment. The ﬁlms will not,
be shown. again unless attendance is
large enough to indicate that stu-
dents want them." ~

“Even if the newsreel project as

it _is now being tried should -not prove ~'

successful,” said Leonard Marks, C35,
chairman of the Executive committee
of the SFA, “it will have been val-
uable experience in helping us to
promote similar projects when the

Stephen Collins Foster Memorial audi-

torium will be completed.”

The screening committee will meet
downtown tomorrow morning to pre-
view the ﬁlms and to choose 'Wednes-
day's program. Faculty members are

Stefansson Returns Next Tuesday
To Explain Final Arctic ‘Abolition’

 

The Arctic is “on its last legs” so
far as noii-intercourse is concerned
and Dr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson, great-
est living authority on the Eskimo and
the Far North, comes here next Tues-
day, March 12, to explain how the
Arctic is being “abolished.” *

All third-hour classes will
omitted.

Dr. Stefansson spoke here at an as-
sembly last December. He took part
in three extended explorations in the
past 28 years, lived in the North ﬁve
solid years at one time, wrote seven
books about the country and learned
the language,of the Eskimos.

Next Tuesday afternoon at 1:30
o’clock he will address a group in
the Falk school. At 3:30 o’clock he
will speak in Room 817, Cathedral.
Both afternoon lectures will be open
to students.

The following day Dr. Stefansson

be

will make four addresses in Erie.

The explorer will return to the Uni-
versity campus March 26, April 2, 8
and 18 for other lectures.

Besides “Abolition of the Arctic,"
Dr. Stefansson will speak successively
on “The friendly Arctic," “Stepping
into stone age society," “The blonde
Eskimos and “Polar geography and
anthrology.”

Dr. Stefansson at his last lecture
here astounded the audience by de-
claring explorers “never become used
to the cold-——they protect themselves
from it.”

Next Tuesday he will hold the Arc-
tic has advantages in ﬂying, mining,
ﬁshing, ranching and as a resort which
soon will open it up to the world.

“The ice is a great disadvantage,”
he said, “when. you want to sail or
swim. But it is an. inestimable con-
venience when you want to land a
plane or walk.” .

Head On Wane?

By Edwin Banks

RANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT is a;

man whose political and economic’
philosophy I have long since given up
the attempt to understand. Capital-
ists have branded him as a socialist,
radicals have labelled him as a. con-
servative, impartial observers ha.ve
called him a straddler, and laboring
men are beginning to compare him to
Ramsay MacDonald, a leftist liberal
who has betrayed his cause.

Vifhatever principles the President
may adhere to in the privacy of his
mind, it seems to be pretty deﬁnitely
a fact that he is, like Stalin, an op-
portunist. Roosevelt. has kept his ear
to the ground. He was swept" into
oﬁice by a great wave of popular
discontent, and he must be keenly
aware that his future political suc-
cess depends upon subduing that
wave. The administration relief pro-
gram has been designed for such a
purpose.

The National Industrial Recovery
Act was launched to produce the same
effect with this difference — Roose-
velt, it seems to me, sincerely be-
lieved that the measure Would. ulti-
mately please both capital and labor.
‘While the relief system was aimed
directly at beneﬁting unemployed,
the NIRA was supposed to help every-
body.. Business men might grumble
at first at having their liberties re-

stricted to-the extent-.that they must

shorten working hours and raise“
wages a little, but they would become
enthusiastic eventually when the in-
crease in purchasing power would be-
come» reflected in a marked rise in
consumption and proﬁts. W'orkers
would be tickled with their,.bettered
conditions "and especially" with the
recognition of their right to collective
bargaining. In a few years every-
thing would be hunky-dory. That was
the presidents dream.
“Dead As G. J.’s Cats"

Y THE MIDDLE of last year any-
body who didn’t care to kid him-
self realized that the Blue Eagle was
as dead as General Johnson’s meta-
phorical cats. The codes drafted by
business men were not drastic docu-
ments for the most part. VVa.ges were
not substantially raised, and the only
real accomplishment. of the shortened
hours of work was a “share the star-
vation” program. Furthermore, em-
ployers were only breaking the labor
provisions of the codes, and, almost
without exception, getting away with
their violations.
And labor, which had suffered the
delusion that the NIRA was ushering
in a. new era for the working man,

was learning bitterly that Section 7a
didn't mean anything to business.

The Pitt

The company union, worse than no
union at all as far as labor is con-
cerned, was set up to counteract or-,
gnnizing by the A. F. of L., and other;
activities not so open and above?
board were engaged in to nullify in?
fact the collective bargaining clause.
7a Already Wiped Off

Last week a federal judge declared
Section ‘Fa unconstitutional as applied
in intrastate commerce. That action
was hardly necessary. Section 7a
has already been wiped off the statute
books.

But unless the Supreme Court re-
verses this decision, Judge Nields
will have. done one service for Amer-
ican labor. He will have brought the
sorry mess between organized em-
ployer and organized employee to a
showdown. At least, that is a devel-
opment I expect. '

Franklin Roosevelt must have dis-
covered by this time that self-govern
ment in industry is an ideal impossi-
ble, gf fulﬁllment just .-asa -federal
system of government is an illusion.
No two groups like capital and labor,
whose interests and aims while not
inevitably are usuallyirreconcilablo,
can adjust their differences satisfac-
torily for long.

One class must be able to impose
its will on the other or else a third
force superior to the other two
and not prejudiced toward or
against either must be able to end
their disputes for them. The Presi-
den’s idea of self-government in in-
dustry is like that of the philosophic-
al anarcliists, a lovely, lofty theory
that doesn't. happen fo be realistic.

I submit then that Roosevelt is
again faced with the embarrassing~
task of expounding and making pub-
licuag new. position on our industrial
fiuiiible. The time"‘has""come- when"
further straddling will anger both
business men and the masses.

Mr. President, how about letting
us know where you stand?

James Joyce’s ‘Ulysses’-—
Expression Of Despair

By Hen'ymon Maurer

 

Part Three

Maurer’s interpretation of James Joyce’s book
will be completed in three parts.——Ed. Note.

HE NEWNE-SS of method has blinded critics to Joyce's reaction to his

characters and his material.

He has been said to be philosophically de-
tached, to be, though disillusioned, sympathetic.

But if we do not allow

ourselves to be blinded by the brilliance of the technique, we must recog-

nice that Joyce’s attitude is entirely one of regret.
Joyce is in that condition of attaraxia, or passionlessness, which Epi-

curus desired, but which upsets Joyce
or -happy or s_vn1-patheticn H-is char-

profoundly. He is unable to be angry

acters are too animal to cause excite-
ment. Joyce regrets not so much
that his characters are dead and in-
human but that he cannot react to
their deadness. He seems to say,
“These people are so low, so dirty
that even though they are human be-
ings I can’t become angry at them. I
can't sympathize with them. If I only
could. I cannot.” .

Joyce has arrived at this attitude
largely because he is squeamish. The
popular picture of him as a man frank-
ly facing certain crudities of life is
false. His frankness is almost self-

torture. From his

a c quaintance

with the words

and the actions
of many people
 Joyce. .,r_eads. - into
the inner nature
of his characters
those words and
actions to which
he himself has

. reacted. _

No one can get
into the mind of
other persons;

 

Joyce of neces-

. sity must base

Herrymon Maurer his experience
on external ap-

pearances, and since he is a very sen-
sitive man he decides that a. person
who vomits has nothing else but
vomiting in his make-up. He is so
struck by the obvious traits, by the
sordid outward expressions of certain
peoples——at least he is so struck
until he attempts wholesale wish-ful-
ﬁllment—that he is unable to imagine
anything constructive or excellent
within.

But in most people, however up-
setting and revolting they may on
the surface appear, these elements
are present. It is too bad that up to
the Nighttown scene Joyce can see
only the act of vomiting. But after
that episode Joyce tries to round out
his characters with goodnesses and
justifications which are so forced that

I

the change in nature is incomprehen-
sible without recourse to unnatural
agents.

As it is, in the ‘best parts of
Ulysses, Joyce takes away a good
deal of the roundness w-hich is neces-
sary to make a character or a group
of characters live for the reader. He
endows his characters with one-track
minds. Althoughthe narrative may
progress, the characters think very
much the same thoughts at one time
as they do at another. The reader
senses, if only unconsciously, the ex-
aggerationof one phase of character,
and does not receive a forceful im-
pression. . _

This is unfortunate, since Joyce
has something important to say. He
says -*t’n’-a't*7‘the thoughts which~a're in‘
the minds of the persons living in
what is accepted as the highest civil-
ization of all time are not the lovely
thoughts that a great many people
suspect. A world has decayed, and
decayed so thoroughly that’ a sensli
tive man can feel nothing but regret
in contemplating it. It will not be
until we recognize the truth of
Joyce’s diagnosis that we can recon-
struct.

But it is not only the decay of the
life around him, but also Joyce’s
manner of looking at that life which
brings him to despair. This manner
is entirely traditional; it is scientiﬁc,
careful, complete, poetic. Joyce, who
comes at the end of the established
English literary ttlradition, can be
more suitably compared to Shake-
speare, who came at its beginning,
than any other iluthor.

In both of them the approach to
man is that of an approach to a ma-
chine to be put through its move-
ments, watched critically, and then
to be labelled as if it were a some-
what imperfect watch-works, Neither
Joyce nor Shakespeare can become
interested in man simply because he
is man. They cannot sympathize
with anything so cold as an automa-

Obstacles to sympathy did not

obstacles to pity do bother Joyce;
they cause his despair. He lakes ref-
uge in technique even more violently
than the older artists; he even takes
refuge in sentimentality.

Joyce comes at the end of a long
line of scientiﬁc analyists. He has ap-
plied the method, h_e has searched as
deeply as its limited nature will al-
low, and the method has failed to
make possible a vital reaction be-
tween the artist and the people of his
environment. It is significant that
that part of Ulysses which is framed
in the most thorough. going scientiﬁc
fashion, in the question-answer meth-
od, is the vehicle least suitable to
carry the thought. Alike are Joyce
and Shakespeare, exceptthat Joyce,
who comes after ,__$h,akespeare, has
realized, unconsciously’ 'perhaps;~‘ that
the world is decaying and that the
old way, of looking at life is barren.

{However necessary it may be to un-
derstand the truth of Joyce's essen-
tial attitude. Ulyses, I am afraid, will
have little to do with its establish-
ment. The essential in Ulysses is
too hidden, too obscured by tech-
nique; the elements-are too often dis-
connected to serve widespread prac-
tical purposes, Perhaps we can use
Joyce best as an awful example of
what a decadent age can do to a sen-
sitive man.

If only Joyce had been a little more
clear about his own emotional reac-
tions, the inﬂuence of Ulysses might
have been surprising. As it is, we
must read his analysis of the low
bourgeois mind,.we must meet his at-
titude, understanding its truth, how-
ever exaggerated, and having real-
ized the presence of sickness, formu-
late ways of getting rid of it. If
only Joyce had been a little more

Collegiate Dance -Bands
To Make European Trips

According to an announcement of
the Men’s Placement bureau, two ﬁve-
piece bands will make European trips
this summer similar to those made
last year by William J. Bailey, C34,
and John Francis Lally, BA37.

Men1bers of a dance band making
one of the tours last year paid a fee
of $10.00 to their promoter, and prev
sented themselves at the port of sail-
ing at their own expense.

Tmnsportation, room and meals
were provided by the steamship com-
pany while on the water, and suffi-
cient time was permitted for travel
in England and Europe at the band’s

expense.

 

 

You like me best because I am
so mellow, rich, ﬂavorful. She
chooses me in preference to
other cigarettes for another
reason; because I am so mild
and easy on her throat. But you
both prefer me because I am
made exclusively from fragrant,

expensive center leaves. That’ s
why I’m milder. That’s why I
taste better. No top leaves, unripe
and stinging; no bottom leaves,
coarse and sandy, are permitted
to destroy my uniform mildness
and good taste. I’m your best
friend. I am your. Lucky Strike.

Cats Continue Cavalcade
Of Victories Over Skibos

Cribbs Leads Attack As Cagers Win, 36-31;
Rigg Sparkles In Tartan Defeat

By Charles A. Ruch

Carnegie Tech ’s clansmen may be excused for being quite satisﬁed
that Mr. Claire Cribbs has seen action for the last time against their
beloved Skibo basketball team. Giving one of the most sparkling
exhibitions of his brilliant career as a Pitt basketeer, Cribbs led the
Panthers to a 36-31 victory over the Techs and did everything a fel-
low could possibly do on a basketball ﬂoor except to jump through

the hoop.

On .the other hand it must be said9

that the Pittadherents a'ren't.r-unning
to the nearest wailing wall just be-
cause Captain Ted Rigg of the Tar-
tans has ﬁnished his performances
against the Panthers. Mr. Rigg sent
seven field goals and one foul shot
through the hoop to keep the S-kibos
in the ball game while all his team-
mates put together were garnering
only one more point than did Rigg.

The victory puts Pitt out in front
for the nonce in the city title series
and it all depends upon the outcome
of the Tech-Duquesne game tomorrow
as to whether or not the nonce will
get an extension. Beating the Tar-
tans also moved the Panthers one step
nearer the title in the Eastern Inter-
collegiate conference.

Pitt certainly had the Indian sign on
the foul shots, sinking nine without a
miss in the ﬁrst._half and ﬁve out_of
nine in the second half.

It was a foul toss by Pete Noon
which started off the scoring for the
evening after the boys had slammed
up and down the court fora couple

of minutes without doing‘ much. TC-ribbs‘

dropped in the first of his ﬁve ﬁeld
goals to give the Panthers a working
margin but Macalka and Rigg shot a
ﬁeld goal apiece to put Tech in the
lead for the ﬁrst time—and the last.

Roderick Gets Two

Roderick got two in a row from the
ﬁeld and from then on until the end
of the half the Panthers kept piling
up the score and sinking the fouls
with monotonous regularity. Cribbs
furnished the fans with something to
rave about by putting a couple of
marvelously longshots through the
hoop. although the brightest bit was
the one he banked in on a left—handed
‘toss as he headed for the crowd in a
corner of the court.

Facing a deﬁcit of 23-12 when they
came back to start the second half,
the Tartans began to go. “Stretch”
Janies, who does just that with a
frame of something over six and a.
half feet, got two ﬁeld goals, Macalka
added another and then James eased
in his third, bringing the count to
25-20. Fouls by Hughes and Roderick
gave the Panthers their boost. Cribbs
and Rigg balanced ﬁeld goals and
Rigs: added a foul to make it 27-23 and
put Tech close again, but here Wainio
and Cribbs registered ﬁeld goals to
help the Pitt cause. '

From then on in it was Hughes for
Pitt and Rigg for Tech who took care
of all the scoring, with the exception
of a ﬁeld goal by Ewalt. Hughes got
ﬁve points and Rigg netted six but the
comeback of the Tartans wasn’t
strong enough to overtake the Pan-
thers.

Although the game was plenty
rough in spots, only one man was
banished from each team on personal
fouls. Noon, who played great ball
while he was in there, was the first
to leave. Felser, subbing for Spisak,
went out in the ﬁnal minutes after
figuring in a double foul with -Skippy
Hughes.

The fans were treated to something
unusual when “Stretch” James “rob-
bed” Ferguson of a ﬁeld goal by the
simple method of reaching up above
the basket and catching the ball as
it was dropping straight for the hoop.
The more unusual that method is, the
better for Pitt, inasmuch as Mr. James
is only a sophomore. ' ‘

Fall As Middies Score Sweep

The Navy continued to dominate the
Eastern Intercollegiate wrestling spot-
light today, after easily defeating
Coach Earl Oster’s Panther matmen,
38 to 0, in a match at Annapolis, Sat-
urday. The Middies made a clean
sweep of the card, taking seven of
the eight bouts by falls as they scored
the most overwhelming vic-‘tory in the
history of the matt sport. at Annapolis

The matches were close in only two
divisions, the welterweight,-in which
Wright of Navythrew ‘ Thurston of
Pittsburgh in nine and a half minutes;
and the junior middleweight division
in which Adams, of Navy, won a vic-
tory over George, the Panther repre-
sentative.~

Captain Detzel of the Panthers was
defeated. by Schacht in the heavy-
weight bout. Detzel became a little
too anxious to ﬁnish up the Navy
heavy and charged him with all
speeds forward. Schacht sidestepped
and went after Detzel with a bar and
chancery hold that had the Pitt cap-
tain pinned to the mat after three min--
utes and 30 seconds.

Badger Boxers
Outslug Panther
Ringmen, 5‘/3-2%

By Thomas Fellow

In a match featured by three tech-
nical knockouts, the University of
Wisconsin defeated the Panther var-
sity boxers at the Stadium pavilion
Saturday night, by a score of 5% to
2%.
The Badgers won ﬁve out of eight
bouts and gained a draw in another.
Russell, Vvisconsin bantamweight,
Harman, middleweight, and Wright,
heavyweight, won technical K. O.’_s
over their Panther opponents. Wright
won the decision in the heavyweight
event when,Linderman_ of Pitt, struck
his head on the apron boards of the
ring in falling,‘ and was unable , to
continue.

Captain Jimmy Giannatti continued

his winning streak when he obtained
the nod over George Stupar, of Wis-
cousin. and Bernie, ,
welterweight kept his record intact.
by gaining a draw with Nick Didier of
Wisconsin. . -
_ Gene, Stoughton, ﬁghting in the
175-pound division, had a tougher
time in his bout than he will ever
have playing a tackle for the Panthers
on the football ﬁeld.

Stoughton opposed Deanovich, also
a Badger grid perfromer, and the
boys went at it with a rush, that were
both of them o11t by the end of the
second round. The Panther boxer
came out with a whirlwind attack to
start the third and this outburst likely
won him the decision. -

Joe Kopp lost to Zyanda, Badger,

165-pounder, in the only bout. which
the fans appeared to believe went the
wrong way on the judges’ scoring
charts.

Chet Smith, sports, editor of _the
Pittsburgh Press, was the third man
in the ring. Aside from the jibes of
his fellow scribes, .-Chet appeared to
do well enough.

Pi Lambda Phi Menaces Delt Five
In League “A” Competition

Despite the loss of Jules Green,
clever Pi Lam forward, the Dithridge
street boys of the green-pillared and
rich-orange frat, tripped up a previ-
ously undefeated Sigma -Chi combina-
tion, 24-17, and thus stepped into
the league “A” leadership last Wed-
nesday.

Delta Tau Delta carved out 50 per
cent of the Pi La_m’s first place berth
for themselves as Sigma Alpha Mu
staggered from a. 44 to 9 rout.

In the ﬁnal league “A” game,
Theta Chi, served notice on the pres-
ent leaders when they registered a
34'toi1‘4 win o'ver Phi’ Epsilon Pi.

Pitt gridmen again ﬁgured promi-
nently in Greek basketball last Wed-
nesday evening on the Trees Gymna-
sium court. “Izzy” Weinstock, All-
American line-bucking fullback,
teamed up with Brother Wohlgemuth,
another 1935 Pitt Panther, to lead
the Pi Lam's in spilling the Sigma
_Chi’s._ “Wohlgy" also captured high
scoring honorswith four ﬁeld goals
and one charity toss. Gridder Stough-
ton led the Sigma Chi’s with five
points. A
. Eckert with nine, and Robinson and
Andrews with eight apiece were re-
sponsible for Theta -Chi’s ﬁne show-
ing against Phi Epsilon Pi.

On -Thursday, Phi Kappa took a
close one from Lambda Chi.Alpha by
throwing up an airtight defense in
the closing periods of play. “Chow”
Souchak, hefty guard on the Phi Kap
ﬁve, paced his mates in their 18-17
victory , with 10 points.

Immediately after "this game, Kap-
pa Sigma. snapped the three-game
winning -streak of Pi K A by the de-
cisive score of 48 to 23. The red and
white passers blanked the previous
leaders, 15-0. in the first quarter.

Michelosen continued his scoring
spree from the hole with 20 points.
Don lHensley was runner-up with 18
markers.

Pi Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, and
Phi Kappa now share ﬁrst place with
three wins and one loss, each. Kap-
pa Sigma’s forfeiture of their win
over Phi Kappa has created this triple
tie in the “B’ league. George Shot-
well of Kappa Sigma. was ruled inel-
igible due to 1nid—semester graduation,
thus causing a forfeiture of the game
he competed in—the Kappa Sig-Phi
Kap contest. A play-off looms up in
this league from present indications.

Style Bulletin
Finds Creations

Subtle, Tricky

Quieter and non-sensational fabrics
will strike a new note this spring,
according to the’late’st‘Fasl1'ion' Re’-
porter, a style bulletin published
semi-monthly by the Research Bureau
for Retail Training.

“There are plenty of new creations
to talk about——more than ever, but
they don’t loudly ﬂaunt their own vir-
tues,” the booklet writes. “Very sub-
tle are the tricks in the new weaves.
It may be the mere twist of an extra
thread, or the wcoly effect of a pure
silk———but there’s something about a
1935 spring fabric that makes most
of last year’s fabrics look sadly un-
interesting.”

Coeds have only to await the com-
ing of spring to blossom out in new
suits, lightweight coats, and “With-
out-a-coat” dresses. Woolens are cor-
rect or tailored suitings, more or
less masculine; for sports, in light
and soft and interesting weaves, in

bright colors, and in checks and
plaids: and for dress, woolens are
sheer, “of a crepey matelasse texture,”
nubby ratine, and boucle effects.

The new synthetics are more rea.l.-
istic than ever and are put out in
more interesting and varied weaves.
“Puft’.ed rice,” “iingerwave,” and other
surface patterns creat new effects in
the fabrics.

011 colors, which will run rampant
in the spring, the ‘Fashion Reporter
«rites, “Regency colors dominate the
field, peasant and gypsy colors lend
gaiety to the picture, and in the an-
nual spring epidemic of blues, navy
will lead. Gay, clear colors and striki

 

will predominate, though the families
of brown, tan, and gray will not be

slighted.”

Deans Discuss

Coed Problems
Of Love, Sleep

‘That would you do if all the women
in school were to fall in love with the
janitor, the iceman, or perhaps the
postman? It would be a queer hap-
pening at. the University, but to the
dean of women in a girls’ school it is
a serious problem.

According to Miss Helen Rush, as-

sistant dean of women, who returned.
last week from the NADVV convention
in Atlantic City, this peculiar situa-
tion was a problem submitted before
a session of college deans.

Another problem peculiar to girls’
schools is that they sleep until the
last minute before classes and don't
take time to dress. Coeds may be
seen going about campus with a
skirt and sweater thrown over top of
pajamas, tousled, uncombed hair and
sometimes even unmatched shoes.

But other problems discussed by
the deans’ convention were of a less
humorous nature. - Some suggested. that
most university students needed psy-
chiatric treatment, and one univer-
sity had a department of psychiatrists
who tend to the problems of women
students. Other delegates insisted
that such a. plan was not within the
scope of university personnel work,
and believed that the school might
just as well install an emergency op-
eration room.

The question of the place of wo-
men’s fraternities on a college cam-
pus was also considered. The view-
point of individual deans differs wide-
ly on this point, Miss Rush says. Some
of the delegates think of everything
i11 terms of fraternities, while others
refuse to discuss the matter.

One dean, acording to Miss Rush,
stated that one of the most interest-
ing ﬁelds of work at her school was
the work with fraternities. Yet, the
dean did not know how many fra-
ternities were on campus, who be-
longed to what fraternity, and she
had never attended a Panhellenic
meeting. The theory on which this
particular dean worked on was to
let well enough alone. Many schools
do not recognize a fraternity problem
and leave the individual groups to
work out a co-operative program.

There are some schools who lay
stress upon the academic work of
students, but the general tendency is
to take a broader interest in the ex-
tra curricular activities of students.
The University falls within the latter
classiﬁcation.
