l,\Chance at MC Post

By AL DONALSON
For the ﬁrst»time in’many years, there is a possibility
that an independent. will be president of Men’s Council.
Last week, three Panther Party men and one indepen-
dent were elected MC representatives from the various class
offices. This was the result of a new ruling which Men’s
Council approved earlier this semester.
Officers of the various classes are now expected to se-

xlect a representative from among
‘themselves to serve as their MC
candidate. Prior to this semester,
 presidents ‘St the classes al-
waysserved as the Council repre-
se_nta_tives. V 
i 3 Panthers Selected

 ‘ Tom Walsh, Col. ’57, Jerry Mur-
 " ray,‘ Bus. Ad. ’57, and Jan Swen-
‘ sen, Col. "59, are the three Pan-
thers who have been selected class
representatives. Jm Marino, Col.

I '58, who ran independent of party
'i affiliation, was selected as the rep-
resentative of his class. Marino,
 who _is the ﬁfth-man of the Col-
 lege junior class, is expected to
"* H vote with the Independent Party.
. Two other classes, the junior
fi and sophomore of Business Ad-
, ‘ministration, will decide on their ~
"  representative this week.
’ At the present time, the Panther
Party has a two ‘vote edge over
‘khellndependents in Council. The
 Panthers have eleven representa-
#9 tives seated, while the Independ-
 ents' have nine. The All-Pitts have

7',-'5. »-two. . _

 A Elections ToiBe Held Friday

 According .to talk_in the Inde-

pendent political circles, either

 Tarolli or,Mitch Kozikowski, Engr.

 ’57, will ge the Independents’

 support ‘for the presidency.

A ‘ However, it appears that Ron
Sobel,«Col.-’57, who is expected
to be the Panthers’ choice, has
_the inside track on’ the presi-

, dency. Sobel may get the sup-

  liberulizing liberties  7

Constitutional lawand military codes are. being altered
and shifted by individuals who ﬁnd it to their convenience
to shape the law to suit themselves, either for political ex-
pediency or out of misguided sincerity resultant of the big
“red” scare a few years back.

. The American’ Association- of University Professors

- after languishing behind for all too -long of a time, lashed

out against the decimation of. our civil liberties at its na-
tional convention last week and condemned eight universi-
ties for ﬁring -professors for using the Constitutional Fifth
Amendment. _ ._ .

’ At the same time, the AAUP pulled itself to full sta-
ture in permitting dismissal of University personnel only for
“intellectual dishonesty,” barring none from teaching posi-
tion only because of -political leanings.

Thus, Democrats, Republicans, Vegetarians and even
Communists will be permitted to teach in the university
systems as long as that didacticism which they expound
is presented fairly and honestly, permitting the student to
judge values for themselves.

. , Presently, the Servicemen’slDefense Committee headed
by New York Senator Emmanuel Cellar is ﬁghting grave in-
justices in the Army’s loyalty—security program. By now,

A’ newspaper readers are familiar with the dishonorable dis-

charge of approximat_ely '48 soldiers for actions the Army

deemed undesirable before their. entrance into the military.

Although the‘Universal Military Training and Service
Act declares plainly that a drafteefs discharge’ must be
based on “the character of the service he has rendered while

‘inhthe armed services’_’ hundreds of soldiers have been dis-
_rnisssd for reasons extraneous of their military service.

Thus the military has been conducting political and so-

"cial censorship of its recruits “before, during, and for the

six reserve years following“ military service.” Last year,
the Army committee discussed the problem, but since pub-

_ lishing an obscure primary report, they have not been heard

from for two months. Justice works slow, but military em-
barrassment‘and a red-faced defense secretary are slowing
it up even, further. In both American Universities and the
Armed services, the constitution has been translated loosely

by persons fearing for their jobs during a “big scare” that

comes of awry foreign politics and uncoordinated civil poli-
cy. The sooner a change comes based on clear-cut policy
in upper echelons the better it w_ill be for the security of
free-thinking United. States citizens.

‘You're My Kid's. Teacher’

lrreverance For Educatio 

By Irv Rothman

The ﬁrst part of the Twentieth Century may be
known literary terms as the Age of Shaw. The
not-so venerable codger was the critic and the
writer and the social thinker and set a pace of
social satire that was to lead to the undermining
of plutocratic aristocracy as well as an irrever-
ance for institutionalized education.

In “Pygmalion” which the Pitt
Players will present next week

 
 

and prides himself on the way
“thousands of men and women
. . . have sloughed off their na-
tive dialects and acquired a na-
tive tongue.” -

Yet,‘ he hardly attributes. it
to modern education systems, _
for, in one of the early scenes 
after a man called Higgins has asked the ﬂower
girl Liza to recite the alphabet, he cries out against
her futile effort, “Stop, Listen to this . . . This
is what-we pay for as elementary education. This
unfortunate animal has been locked ‘up for nine
years in school at our expense to teach her to
speak and read the language of Shakespeare and
Milton. And the result is ‘Ahye,? ‘Bay-yee.’. .”

Lots to Laugh About ' ‘
Yet, Shaw would have ,had quite aﬁbit to laugh
about if he..cou1d have seen the incident recently

of a young Junior High School Teacher in Iowa’

barred from his position because he wanted too
fast to teach students those ideas that might have
shaped their minds intelligently.

Twenty-one year old Paul Richer, after having
graduated from the University of Iowa, went to
Riceville with an idea of methods he might use
to teach. students. and an enthusiasm for litera-
ture he wanted to impart to them. '

After engaging students in cafeteria-table dis-
cussions and winning their conﬁdence by a friend-'
ly, youthful, and vigorous attitude, he began to

“What Do We‘ Have Here?"

teach his “farm-boys” poetry branching out to a
study of the history of the Great Religions. I
Protest From Community , _ * U

The inexplorable protest came from the com- ‘
munity—the people complained about his teaching
unnecessary poetry, incomprehensible Shakespeare,
even voiced disapproval of his discussing “Black:
board Jungle,” because it showed a young boy be-
ing stabbed by a ﬂagstaff with the American flag
on it. A ‘

When he conducted a 21/2 week study of 'Com- ~.
munism—as objectively as he could imagine-a
bigger howl arose and even the Congregational;
minister accused him of being a Communist.

Brash and bold, young Richer objected and
eventually was ﬁred from his position-—a position

‘ in which he never faltered, although he may well
have been too bold.

But if nothing else, the incident "shows that
education of the children still remains a ﬁght with
the parents—-a peoples who have left their own
days of ﬁghting and demanding‘ farbehind in their
submission to a complacent, conservativesociety
—with reservation of course. A

; Remaining Scare Term

The subject of “Communism” remains a scare _
term.‘ Despite progress since the McCarthy disas- .
ter, folks still worry fortheir jobs that someone .
might accuse’ them of. Communism; _and college
administrators in many schools still insist that a A
man may be ﬁred due to his political aﬁiliation. _

Senator Fred P. Harelof Somerset. County'once . i
told of his experience in a bar while he was““~‘-—»-
a speaker. Walkingiin and ordering a drink, he
recognized’ a wide-eyed open—mouthed fellow sit-‘.
ting there who was the father of a son he had in
class. “Whatda ya mean coming inta this place.
.You’re my kid’s teacher,” the parent blurted out.

Yes, Shaw would have enjoyed being alive
even today. He’d have a lot to laugh about if he," ‘
considered education in the United‘ States. But,
on second thought'he probably did, for it is an
old story. ‘ ~ -

Mrs. Salk Starts Series
For Parents Magazine

Mrs. Jonas E. Salk, wife of the polio scientist, is writ-
a series of magazine articles on parent-child problems.

Her articles are based on her experiences as a professional
social worker in New York and Michigan, following gradua-
tion from Columbia University’s School of Social Work.

In her ﬁrst article, Mrs. Salk stresses the need for both
parents to spend time with their children, and she tries to re-
assure folks who often sigh:

I Awednesday;     -NEIWIS-4Page,S

“Learning the skills of par-
enthood is easier for some of L
us than for others, just as talents_
differ in learning a language, a
sport or a mechanical art.”

Mrs. Salk speaks from persdnal.

experience. She is the mother of
three young boys. In addition, she
is 'a member of Mayor Lawrence's
Commission on Human Relations,
a director of the Child Guidance
Center and active in the County
Health and We1fare_‘Federation.

THE MANY LOVES
OF THORWALDV DOCKSTADER

Whéh Thorwald Dockstader—sophom-ore, epicure, and sports-
man—ﬁrst took up smoking, he did not simply choose the ﬁrst

, brand of cigarettes that came to hand. N o, indeed! Hedid what

any sophomore, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled
several brands and then picked the gentlest, tastiest, most
thumpingly, wondrously, unfailingly pleasing of a1l—Philip
Morris, of corris! _ ' , ’
Similarly, when Thorwald Dockstader took up girls, he did
not simply select the ﬁrst one who came along. No, indeed!
Thorwald sampled. He took out several likely girls and then he
compared their charms and then he made his choice. ‘
His ﬁrst date was with an English lit major named Elizabeth
Barrett Grish, a wisp of a girl with luminous eyes and a soul
that shimmered with a pale, unearthly beauty. Trippingly,
trippingly, she walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat
with him behind a windward dune and listened to a sea shell
and sighed sweetly and took out a little gold pencil and a little
morocco notebook and wrote a little poem: . -

‘I will lie -upon the shore,

I will baa dreamer.

I will feel the sea. once more
,_ Pounding on my forum‘.
Th_orwald’s second date was’ with a physical ed major named
Peaches Glendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile and a
size 18 neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder track where
they jogged around thirty or forty times to open up the pores.’

Then they played four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 36
holes of golf, nine innings of one-o-cat, four periods of rugger,
six chukkers of lacrosse, and.a mile and a quarter of leap frog.
Then they worked out for a few hours on the parallel bars,,the
ﬂying rings‘, and the bongo board, and then went ten rounds‘

.with the eight-ounce gloves. Then they had'heaping'bowls of’
bran an whey, eicchanged a manly ‘handshake, and went home‘
to their respective‘ whirlpool baths.

A Thorwald’s ﬁnal date was with ‘a goldcn—ha.ired, crca“n‘y-browed,
green-eyed,‘ red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi Mclistway.

Totsi. was not majoring in anything. As she often’ said, “Gee-

whillikers, what’s college for anyhow —-‘to ﬁll "your head full of
morbid old facts, or,to discover the shining essence that is
YOU?” _ «

Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious res-

taurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock_

hen. From there they wentto a de luxe movie palace where Totsi‘
had popcorn with butter and a bag of chocolate covered raisins
—also with butter. Then they went to a costly ballroom and
chap-cha’d till dawn, tipping the band wildly all the while. Then‘
they went to a Chinese restaurant where Totsi, unable to deci-

_ pher the large and baﬂiing menu, solved her problem by order-
ing one of everything. Then Thorwald took her to the women's if

dorm, boosted her in the window, and went downtown to wait
for the Morris Plan office to open.

While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
came to a decision. “It is clear,” said Thorwald, “that I am not
yet ready for girls.” “It is equally clear," he continued, “that

. a man needs a gentle companion, and who,” he asked, “will be"
my gentle companion?” “Why, PHILIP MORRIS, of corris,"
he answered. “Philip Morris will be my tender comrade, my
solace and my strength, my friend in adversity, my shelter in
vicissitude, my boon and bosom buddy,” and, so saying, Thor-
wald lit a PHILIP MORRIS and was content. ©M., 3,,,,1,,,,,,, 1,5, ’

 ‘Children Will Be-Finer’

“Excellence”, Urged by Moore

.:.:.__

Service in Society ‘
Must Be Purpose

‘For T rue Scholars

By BARBARA CHERINGTON

“Devotion to Excellence”
and “not just mediocrity”
should be the aims of students,
stated Dr. Robert Moore, vice
chancellor of the Medical
School and guest ‘speaker at
Schola'r’s Day Assembly to-
day, 10:30 a.m. ‘

“We have a high level of re-
sponsibility and that is to serve

‘society the rest of our lives as

seen from experiences in school,”
the Vice Chancellor said. There

-are two types of schooling, he

claimed, “in being sent to school
and in. going to school.” He “hopes
everyone goes to school.”

As for women who go to school
with the possibility of marrying
before graduation or shortly there.-
after, their “children will be ﬁner
people because the women have
had a college education,” he said
in an interview.

Move to New Med School

In connection -with the new
medical’ school, Dr. Moore said all
classes .will begin by January’ 1,
1957. Classes in nursing, dentistry
in the
new locale by September of this
year. V ' A

There is atrend in the dental

and medical school toward stu- ~

dents doing more work in the
clinical aspect. This is actual
treatment of out-patients, rath-
er than pre-clinical laboratory
work. At present much" of the
dent school practice is clinical.

While last year about ten or

eleven weeks of the senior year in _
. medical school was spent ni clini-

calxwork, about 18 weeks of clini-
cal work is planned for the com-
ing year. I

The instigation of combined
faculty of full-time and part-time

ffnembers at Pitt, is “not entirely

new,” said Dr. Moore. In 1917
Johns Hopkins and Washington
University began this type of em-

'ployment of doctors for educa-

tional study and research.
Fees Not Restricted,-
on the problem of “the disposi-
tion of the fees which are derived
from the practice .,. . , ” the Vice

Chancellor-stated, “the University

does not tell the individual how

,much or how little to practice,

Frosh Hold Party
Called ‘3 a11d 12;’ .
Honors Officers

Freshman class party, “The 8
and 12 Social” will be held tomor-
row, Thursday, April 19 on the
12th floor to honor the newly
-elected oﬁicers of the class of ’59.

The party will last from 2:30-4:30 _

This party is of particular inter-
estas this is the ﬁrst time that a
class party has been held on the
12th floor with both the men and
the women of the class participat-
ing. .

At 3:30 there will be enter-
tainment provided by members
of the class. The type of enter-
tainment will range from group
singing to duets, from a mon-
ologue to poetry reading. A
special feature will"’be the re-
presentation of the Nationality
Rooms Guild skit which was
ﬁrst presented at the Guild

' party.

Refreshment of punch and cook-
ies will be prepared by the girls
of the Freshman Council. This will
be the last major function of the
Freshman Council before its dut-
ies are completed.

Although all the preparations
for the “8 and 12 Social” are be-
ing made by the women of the
Council, it is expected that the
men will supportthe part)’ Wlth
their ‘co-operation and attendance.

other than to be concerned if he

charge. That is his business as a

Olson Claims Miami ‘Best in Ohio,’
Sowell Tries for First Mile Victory

‘Arriving at their second big¢i

hurdle of the outdoor season, the
Panther thinclads will face Miami

at the Stadium_Friday. Coach Carl
Olson says that “Miami is the best
team in Ohio and should give us
a gtiff battle.”

The ﬁeld events will open up
the meet and should ﬁnd the Blue

«and Gold at a big disadvantage
because this is the weak spot on _

the team while Miami is well forti-
ﬁed with talent here..

and Irwin Templeton will be the
Panther entries in the shot put
Which is the opening event. Tem-
pleton will lead the team’s aspir-

ants in the discus later in the aft—’

ernoon. Unfortunately, there will
be no javelin throw in the meet’
where the team has a pretty sure
point‘-getter in Salvaterra.

Miami Strong in Mile

Arnie Sowell will attempt to’

cop the bro-ad jump with team-
mate Bill Smith giving him strong.
support, Tillman, Miami’s leading
entry in this event, should furnish

' V the major opposition.

Bill Burton, Miami’s big ‘gun,
will lead the visitors in the high \
jump as well as the dashes and
hurdles where he totaled three
victories in last year’s meet. -
Sophomore Charles Heﬂin is the
Panther’s .top man in the high
jump and will be the team’s
hope to stop the, Ohio star.

Since Miami is particularly

' gifted with outstanding milers in

Tom Wood ‘and Joe Cleavenger,
Sowell will run his ﬁrst mile of
the season in an effort to gain a
victory where the Ohioans would

otherwise seem to be sure victors.

Questioned, about the effect
traveling had on the team, Lewis

the traveling tires the boys. Then
too, our pitchers didn’t get a

the inclement weather. It’s hard
to tell a pitcher how to act in a
situation unless he can learn it by
experience."
Pitchers Have Been Wild
“Our ﬁelding has been above
average and the boys have been

big thing that has hurt the squad
has been the wildness of the

 Grid Future Looks Good
After Winning Season

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Writer '

Pitt’s sudden resurgence to gridiron success has apparent-
ly gained its ﬁrst signiﬁcant foothold since the era of the
late Dr. John Sutherland. With spring drills currently under-
way, optimism is at its highest pitch since the Sutherland
regime. The Panthers’ eruptive rise to undreamed of heights
in their ﬁrst season under John Michelosen has the fans
buzzing again about the Blue and Gold’s chances of emulat-

' ing last year’s showing.
' Michelosen produced a winner in his ﬁrst season at his
alma mater. When the Panther mentor accepted the coach-
_‘_....;,.ing position he was expected to eventually have a winner.
‘-4 Hardly anyone anticipated it in his initial season, though.
‘ This one season of power football hbs done more for-Sky-
scraper U. that more than a half dozen coaches, multiple offenses‘,
. ‘and the like couldn’t do since Sutherland. Pitt has been trans-
pired from a school that used to be content with mediocre records
of 6-4, 5-5, and 3-5-1, to a football “hotbed.” ‘\

It looks like Michelosen served himself an ultimatum
when he guided. the Jungle Cats‘ to a 7-3 slate and subse-
quently the Sugar Bowl. This is" ' ’
what he was hired to do, and he
did it. But for the ex-Panther
backﬁeld star the honeymoon, is
cover, and the pressure is mount-
ing and will continue to mount.

Records in the future will have
to be -better or at least compare
favorably with the. 7-3 posted in
1955. This one winning campaign
has captivated the higher athle-

* tic brass,‘ students, fans, and

‘T ,1 alumni to the degree that a win-

‘;:\,-’ ner,is now almost mandatory;

 ‘From henceforth, Pitt will not

' ‘be permitted to slide back to the
days of mediocrity which they
have bitterly experienced in the
last decade.

The pressure is being exerted
from all angles-—prestige, pub-
s : licity, and ﬁnancially.'Presige of
,1‘ V the great ‘teams of the ’30’s; the ,
L  favorable _publicity that ﬂowed
-_ so freely after the loosing effort
L 1 to Georgia Tech; and the 150
' g’s that was added to the ath-

letic treasury. This is one_ ad- _
vantage of being an independent
grid power-'-you don’t have to
split the melon among your con-
ference members as does Okla-
. homa, Michigan State, and sim-
’ uilar conference bowl- partici-
’_,.. - pants. _
But even with the high-pres-_-E.
‘L _ I" sured atmosphere of winning per-
’ vading the Ellsworth ﬁeld prac-
ticesessions these snappy spring
days, Michelosen’s_ position seems
to becoming more and more en-
Viable He again has the neucleus
 that should make the locals have
' L . a team the equal of‘last years.
Brighter possibilities are that it

will be even superior.

Although an array of top- talent
was lostxvia graduation, adequate
replacements should be found
without too much difficulty. Sev-

« eral sophomores and untried re-
1 turnees are likely to make the
’ wdi-fference. And what they can’t
‘ ~ ‘ . compensate -for, the extra _dr1ve
which separates the outstanding
teams from the average—spirit-—

has been reverberated.

‘ Even more important -for fu-

ture seasons, however, is the
favorable attitude of "enrolling
at Pitt that has grasped some
of the high school standouts in
the district who had intentions
of going to the leisure Southern
schools or the persuasive Mid-
westem institutions. Look for
the inﬂux of grid manpower to
skyrocket when Coach Steve
-Petro begins frosh drills next
fall.
« It all adds up to the monotony of
"~”-\ winning, sellout Stadium throngs,
' ‘ and unparalleled grid fervor in
Pittsburgh. The much sought after
grid evolution has been realized
at last. It should be enjoyable.

understand them better. This sort
of insight is one of the important
values of studying history.”

In explaining his year’s work
with the book, Mr. Cleland add-_
ed, “The book is actually ‘an
example of the close coopera-
tion between the Darlington
Room, the University Press, and
the History Department. Such
behind-the-scenes cooperation is
a very important part of the
University that students some-
times don..’t know about.”

Stimulated by history in his
undergraduate days at.West Vir-
ginia University, Mr. Cleland came
to Pitt to earn his master’s in
1952. He has remained at Pitt
four years. -

Presently and in addition to his

teaching, Cleland is attempting to -

set up in the Pitt library a collec-

tion of the papers and documents

of past American labor leaders

/ and labor unions for the purpose

of preserving them so that Pitt
will become a-world center _for»
labor research. ‘ ’ ’

 Cleland’s master’s thesis ‘was ~

also printed in‘ book form under
the title.“.John B. C. Lucas, Physio-

‘ciat of the Frontier.”

Lucas was also an intimate

friend of Hugh Henry Bracken-
ridge, founder of the college
which has become the University.

Mr. Clel_and is vociferous in
stating that, as he sees it, teachng
is the best way possible to pre-
sent history. And he -intends to
continue teaching as his major
work. That is, until he decides to
take up the pen again to set down
more history on the printed page.
