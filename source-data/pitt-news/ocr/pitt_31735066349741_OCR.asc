For Faculty Assembly

BY DEANNA LOUISE

A structural revision of the
University Senate, including the
creation of a Faculty Assembly, has
been ratiﬁed by Senate members,
according to Norman Austern,
chairman of the ad hoc committee
on university governance.

At a Senate meeting Friday,
Austern announced that approxi-
mately one-third of the 1200-mem-
ber Senate body approved the plan.
Only 625 ballots were cast.

According to the committee’s
final report, the Faculty Assembly
“should be a body to recommend
policy on matters that affect the
quality and welfare of the
University. Its purpose should be
to formulate and express faculty
views, criticisms and inquiries on
such matters.”

The Senate Council, comprised
of student, administration and
faculty representatives, will be
maintained. Faculty ‘hembers

Police Fire
Wooden Shots
At Ohio Mob

ATHENS, Ohio (AP)—Police
used riot control tactics—including
wooden bullets—early Sunday to
disperse a group of more‘ than
~l,000 persons who took over two
blocks of a downtown street in an
end-of-school celebration at Ohio
University.

Twenty persons were treated for
minor injuries, including two
policemen, one of whom was struck
by a ﬂying brick, authorities said.

Twenty-four persons were ar-
rested. most of them on misde,-
meanor disorderly conduct char-
ges, and were later released. Two
men were arrested on felony
charges of inciting to riot, and they
remained jailed Sunday morning.

Police Chief Ted Jones estimated
that police fired 70 wooden bullets
into the crowd. but it wasn't known
ifthey caused any injuries. He said
the stinging bullets were fired
because bottles and bricks were
being thrown at officers.

Jones said the celebration, a
tradition at the university, began
Friday night after classes ended for
the spring term. Finals begin next
week. He said students and
nonstudents returned in_ large
numbers Saturday night to a main
street near the university campus,
where there are several taverns
within a-few blocks.

About 1 p.m. Sunday, several
storefront windows were reported
broken and police said they saw
some looting. But there were no

:, arrests because the crowd was too
' thick to allow police to get near,

Jones said.

formerly elected from the Univer-
sity departments, however, will be
elected from the Faculty Assembly.

The group also approved the
formation of an ad hoc drafting
committee to implement the
structural changes and write any
by-law amendments deemed nec-
essary. Chairpersons of Senate
standing committees, past presi-
dents of the Senate and two or
three representatives of the gover-
nance committee will compose the
committee.

The present plan does not
provide for student representation
on the committee, but Austern said
the committee is willing to consider
that possibility.

Senate president William Brown,
reporting for Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, announced a move of the
University research center from the
Office of Planning and Budget to
the Chancellor’s office. The
Chancellor. still is looking for
someone to fill the position of
Associate Provost.of the Office of
Research created by the move,
Brown said.

The Senate also voted to
implement a plan for the direct-
depositing of paychecks of all
University employees who wish to
take advantage of the service.

Task Force On Police

Will Convene Tomorrow

BY CRIS HALL

A student-faculty task force
created by Chancellor Posvar to
make recommendations concerning
activities of the Campus Police has
scheduled public hearings for
tomorrow and next Monday.

According to a June 7 Pitt
Update, all members of the
University community will have the
opportunity to make_ten-minute
presentations to the nine task force

, members.

Posvar created the task force
after a group bf local black leaders
charged the Campus Police with
being racist and guilty of harrass-
ment of blacks on and off campus.

Those black leaders also claimed

the University committees set up to
review charges’ of racism _and
brutality were ineffective and
stacked against the black commun-
ity.
I At the conclusion of the
presentations. discussion is plan-T
ned until the end of each meeting,
which will last approximately two
hours.

Some questions called “essen-

tial" to the committee’s work are:

l2l7C.L. L , -_

*What should be the function of
the campus police?

*How ,much security is wanted
and needed?

*What can be paid for?

*What should be the guidelines
for recruitment, employment,
training and evaluation of campus
policemen? .

*What should be the grievance
and appeal procedures for the
campus police, the University
community and the public concern-
ing University security matters?

*What provisions for reparation
should exist for injury?

*What should be the relationship
of the campus police to the
University community, students
and faculty? and

*What existing or new mechan-
isms should be implemented to
improve_relations consistent with
maintaining appropriate security?

Tomorrow's meeting is sched-
uled to take place from 3:30 p.m. to
5:30 p.m. and Monday’s hearing’ is
set to take place from 7 p.m. to 9
p.m. Both meetings will be held in

presidents, legal awareness com-
mittee chairman and WPGH
general manager are among the 25

positions being remunerated.

Today, the remunerations
process.-has been held up by an
SGB appeal of the original proposal
submitted by the remunerations
committee.

Yesterday, Dan Meloro, director
of student activities,’ announced his
rejection of the SGB appeal after
consulting Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Alfred Moye.

The SGB appeal challenged the
criteria used by the remunerations
committee in choosing which
student leaders are to be paid.

‘The committee used seven
criteria in making its recommenda-
tions weighting some more heavily
than others..

Administrative demand, autono-
my, complexity ‘of duties, group

interaction, personal expenses,”

special required skills and time

demand were assessed and assign- ' , L
ed point values to determine which -_ 

positions would b_e salaried’. - I

 

The 25 positions withthe largest  ll

total points assigned to the tallied
criteria will be salaried.

“The point system used._ toul 
weight the seven criteria is not’ in s I

valid.- The present system does not
deem that time demand always "be

 

rated equally to the criteria of_’- 1
specialized skill and complexity of. s , it

duties. The point system merely

allows these other two criteria to"

potentially have equal signiﬁcance
to time demand, “.Meloro said.
The maximum number of points

 

that may be assignedvto these',g_,"'j/ii

criteria. is equal.

The SGB also objected to the lack. a‘ I is

New Program lnitated

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

“Smoking is a learned habit
which can be unlearned with
proper motivation,” according to
Robert Derden, program coordina-
tor of an eight-week anti-smoking
clinic to ‘be offered at Allegheny

County Community College (ACC).
The program which begins’ _this
week, is sponsored jointly by The
American Cancer Society and ACC.
“The program is designed to
take people through a series of
steps in which they gradually cut
down the number of cigarettes
smoked," said Dr. Lynn Rhem, a
clinical psychologist at Pitt.

Rhem is one of several’consul-'
tants who will be working with
program participants.

The smoker also must submit a

$20 deposit which is refunded if he  " ‘
' completes the course.

 
 

“The deposit insures good '
attendance and helps motivate the 

smoker to successfully complete

the course,” Rhem said.

As part of the program, smokers I i

keep a record of the situations

which induce them to smoke, such ' ‘

program they try to eliminate
smoking in one of these situations.

several applications of positions to
be remunerated in the original
proposal. _
Meloro resolved the disputed
awards be withheld until the
applications in question receive the
appropriate advisor’s signatures.
Tive said obtaining these advi-
sor’s signatures is the only thing
presently delaying the paychecks.
SGB members wanted another

“The seven criteria were submit-

Meloro said.

Along with his rejection of the

A test of ﬁre alarms in fou‘f’

proved successful when city ofﬁ-
cials indicated they received
signals from the Cathedral, the

ter, and Old Engineering and
Alumni halls, according to Univer-
sity Health and Safety Officer
Eugene Barry.

Barry said a problem with city
fire alarm circuit 19 which caused
his office to post notices. on affected
alarm boxes warning they were not
working was the subject of

confusion among city fire offici-géf‘.
alaﬁiﬁ

last week because fire
officials failed to notify the city fire
department, which is a separate
organization.

Barry said yesterday that Univer-
sity custodians were asked Friday
morning to remove the signs from

‘Original’ Owner Defends
-2”"/Business And Clients

BY BILL MOORE

The Original Hot Dog Shop has
the best security in Oakland, the
least problems, and the most
trouble with criticism from the
public, according to Sid Simon,
president of the Original Hot Dog
Shop Inc.

“There is a tremendous amount
of people who come through here
every day, yet we seldom if ever

’ ﬁve any arguments,” Simon said
in response to ' allegations the
Original is the scene of late-night
ﬁghts.

' A second allegation, by Oakland
Development Inc. chairperson Lois
Devereaux that the Original has a
reputation for selling beer- to
minors, was also denied by Simon.

“We sell the largest volume of
beer in Oakland,” the part-owner
said. “Maybe three, four or ﬁve
minors slip through with one of the
300 to 400 six-packs we sell. But
they either have phony IDs or look
a lot older than they are. Those
things happen. Anyone can get a
phony ID for $2.

.“Why would we sell beer to

. , jnors? We don't have to, we do

the Oakland area. “You have
about 90,000 students in a 14-block
area, and about half of them are
underage. We certainly aren’t
serving all of them who drink.”
The first business of the Original
is food, not beer, Simon pointed
out. “We have a liquor license too.
but we don't sell hard liquor during
the week because with hard liquor
you get into a rougher crowd.”
“We do a lot of black business,
and we do a lot of white business,
and we mix it up more than anyone
else. Yet we never have arguments
or fights in here. You know why
people come in here all hours of the
day and night? Because they know
it’s safe in here, that’s why.”
“People complain that we cause
the problems and we sell to minors.
They are picking on us for some
reason. If the Pittsburgh police put
a man in every bar in Oakland for a
day, they could shut them all
down.”

Simon criticized the police and
the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board for releasing minors caught
drinking, yet prosecuting the bar
that sold the beer.

“That’s selective law enforce-
ment. The LCB is supposed to
enforce the law, not interpret it.”

“All they are doing is encoura-
ging minors to drink.”

“One of our major focuses in the

smoke can call another program

FACULTY MEMBERS AWARDED
FULBRIGHT GRANTS ‘

The University of Pittsburgh is
unique in the nation since all four
of its faculty applicants have been

awarded Fulbright grants for,

research abroad.

The awards went to Dr. Karen C.
Smith and Dr. Gwendolyn L. Lewis,
both of the sociology department,
Dr. William B. Crawford of Asian
Studies and Dr. John Beverly of
hispanic languages -and literature.

Post-doctoral research funded by
the Fulbright awards must be in
the area of language and area
studies and cannot take place in

‘Europe, according to Helen Jero-

slow of the University LCe'nter for
International Studies.
Incidentally, several types of .

Fulbright awards are given. One,- ‘
called the Fulbright Hays award, is ’

named after Rep. Wayne Hays,
D-Ohio, currently headlining every
newspaper in the nation for his
involvement in a Congressional sex
scandal.

0 A New Trick A

’ ﬂ 'No, our state leg haven’t given themselves another raise.
h But it seems theiaculty members of the University Senate are
5 picking up a trick or two. Amidst the mumbled ruins of multilateral
representation in the Senate, runs a bulldozed path, leading smack dab
 the doorway of a unilateral Faculty Assembly.
. « Though the University Senate body is comprised of administration,
faculty and student representatives——all of whom presumably had
equal opportunity to adopt or reject the Assembly in Friday’s
referendum——faculty comprise an overwhelming majority of the
' 1,21X)-member Senate body. . \_
i From Student ‘Govermnent Board President Barry Weisband’s
statement that the ratiﬁcation of this proposal “would change the
' University Senate into a Faculty Senate, ” and the obvious squelch this
 putsonboth student and administration inﬂuence in the Senate, it can
_«be concluded safely that few, if any, students approved formation 0
the Assembly. . ‘
‘ Since the faculty dominated the Senate before the Assembly was
resurrected, what can be the signiﬁcance of this move? What can the
_ - faculty. do  the Assembly that they can’t do within the
, = ‘ multilateral Senate body?
’ Until the by-law amendments are drawn, answers will not be
forthcoming: It stands, however, that the committee appointed to draft
these amendments has not officially provided for student
representation. '

A nmjority of faculty representation on this committee creates little

obstacle to the self-delegation of faculty power to lead the Senate by.
l the scruff of its neck. ‘
Lastly, only a microcosm of the faculty-dominated Senate, in fact
V only one-third of I this body, approved the referendum. This
‘ concentrates power in the hands of only a segment of the faculty, but
— .-gives them the impression of large backing and the clout it yields.

  
  
 
   
   
    
   
     
  
   

Deja Vu  

 ’: ' Maybe it is more than 100 miles away and maybe it is in Ohio-and.
-  cares about Ohio anyway?——but Athens, Ohio, police used riot
control tactics, including the ﬁring of Woodeﬂ bullets. to disperse a
crowd Sunday, and-one can’t help but be reminded of another incident
that occurred six years ago in another small Ohio town.
That town was Kent and four people, one of them a "Pittsburgh
as woman, died from gunshot wounds, when riﬂes were used to quell a
 campus protest march.
; j The incident in Athens Sunday was a little different. Fortunately, no
 , one died.
 _ And the crowd had formed for a very different purpose. Rather than
 " _ protesting U.S. action in Vietnam, this crowd was celebrating the end
of spring term. '
Students at Ohio University celebrate the end of spring term every
‘ year. This year, the festivities began last Friday night after classes
» ended. And again on Saturday night, jubiliant students and
3  — " nonstudents returned to the streets, where there are several taverns
within a few blocks. A crowd of over 1,000 formed.
At 1 a. m. Sunday, several storefront windows were reported broken
and police said they saw some looting. There were no arrests made
against looters, though. Police Chief Ted Jones said the crowd was too
:thick to allow police to get near.
Later, 18 riot-equipped oﬂicers used sticks and some tear gas and
ﬁred 70 wooden bullets into the crowd to break up the mob.
Jones said the stinging bullets were ﬁred because bottles and bricks
were being thrown at ofﬁcers.

. That sounds a little bit too much like national guardsmen ﬁring real
bullets at students because they had been taunted and had rocks
thrown at them during that anti-war demonstration six years ago.

Twenty persons were treated for minor injuries in Athens, including
:  . two‘ policemen, one of whom was struck by a ﬂying brick, authorities
' , said. And twenty-four persons were arrested, most of them on
misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges. Also, two men were
 arrested on felony charges of inciting to riot.
‘ Whether or not the mob had grown uncontrollable is hard to sa
’ without having been there. ’

But it isn't hard to say police should use methods for quelling

disturbances other than ﬁring indiscriminately into a mob.

Apparently no one was seriously hurt by the wooden bullets. But

what guarantee is there that the next large group that
assembles—whether it be to celebrate the end of classes or to
M H demonstrate against a government policy——won’t be‘ ﬁred on, too?

Ye Generation of Vipers

BY BILL MOORE

“Ye vipers, ye generation of
vipers, how’ will you escape the
damnation of hell? There is no
escape for you except through
Jesus Christ.”

George Smock, evangelist, for-
mer longhair and drug addict, has a
rich, "deep voice which ﬁlls the
whole of the_5th Avenue side of the
Cathedral lawn. /In his Sears plaid
suit, white shoes and business,-
man’s haircut, he tells an unwill-
ing, hostile audience of his escape
from the temptations of drugs,
women and music. ‘He stands, a
self-styled Christ on the Mount,
ignoring the abuse of the crowd,
ignoring the'giggles, the guffaws,
the obscenities, the rude taunting
of the 30 or so_students interrupted
from studying", sunbathing, ‘ or
whatever, on the Cathedral lawn on
a sun-baked afternoon.

Once a bearded, beaded, burly
ﬂower child of the Haight Ashbury
'60s scene, Smock looks more like
an accountant now than a preacher.
His doubleknit suit looks hot and
uncomfortable beside the‘bathing
suits and cutoffs worn by his
audience.

He says he is at Pitt to teach
Religion 101—The Fundamentals
of Christianity—and that the lawn

Doesn’t anyone dare take an
opposing view from the black
militants concerning the present
furor over the so-called racist Pitt
cops? I do! Let me lift the cover of
vague generalizations, prejudicial
opinions, derogatory accusations
hurled against the Campus Police
and see if we can find these
bigoted, brutal, comtemptible cops
inside the box.

Let's start with Chief Curt
Graham. He is accused of not
maintaining good supervision over
the police force.
dedication to the principle of
providing protection and safety for
all members of the campus
community has been physically

Graham’s ‘

. is his classroom. “You have a ﬁnal

exam coming up. We all have a
ﬁnal exam. It's with Jesus Christ,
our Lord and Savior.” .

He calls the University classes
“obscene and communistic,” and
claims he alone has the truth and
the way to freedom.” He answers
a heckler with only one question-
“What time is it?

“The time is now. The time is
now for all of us to all on the Lord,
call on him and you shall be freed.

Call on the Lord and repent your

sins. We all have sins, and \we are

don’t.”

“Look at you. Some of you are
half-naked. The Lord says women

» should be modest in their dress.-”‘

The predominantly male crowd
loves that one. ‘ They hoot and
holler for George “Jed” Smock’s
views on women.

“The Lord said men are the glory
of God, and women are the glory of
man. Women is the helpmate of
man.”

“How many are thankful God
created women?”

The crowd loves that one even
more. Cheers and applause, along
with some funny ‘asides, greet
Smock as he ﬁnishes his question.

An: Opposing View

An editorial in the May 25 issue
of the Pitt News pointed out that
“the University has a need for a
competent professional police force
that can operate in a high-crime
area, as well as a campus
environment.”

Somebody didn’t do their home-.
work. Graham was cognizant of
this fact long before this article
voiced its aspirations for the
campus police. That is why the
latest group of new members on
the force had to pass a three month
(live-in) academically intensive,
physically gruelly course at the Law
Enforcement Academy in Cham

The crowd complains—“We are
bored, we can’t study, you are full
of it , you are keeping us from
sleeping, we don’t care”—and
Smock invites them to leave. They
stay.

“I was a sinner once. A hippie
and a sinner. Then I was born
again, and now I am a saint. A
saint in the glory of the Lord.» I ask
you how many of you are born
again?"

i The crowd whistles and screams.
“Whoowee, a saint.” One yells
back, “You weren’t born the first

. time. You were hatched.”

The heckler laughs. Some laugh
with him, others smile, others keep
the same look of dazed pity they’v
had allalong. ‘ r

The man is sad. He is
humiliating himself daily in front of
any audience he can ﬁnd. He is an
overzealous fanatic and a spec-
tacle; but he is a person all the
same. People tend to be rude in
groups, and they tend to be ruder
when they know the person cannot
return the.insult. _

Smock, unfortunately, is going to
keep on making a fool of himself,
preaching to those who don’t care
and won’t listen, for some time to
come. But the others, those who
taunt and try to catch him up, are

far worse. They aren’t kooks, they

are cruel.

What was it Smock said.
“Professing yourselves to be wise,
you have become fools.”

mentally alert to suspicious or
criminally overt behavior? I would
suggest that some factions of the
college community mentally resent
while verbally crying out for
dynamic, efficient valid protection.

Bob Pitts has’ accused the
University of hiring police officers
with past records of “harassment
and brutality to students.” What a
slanderous statement! Does he
have proof to back up these
allegations? All potential officers
are subjected to thorough back-.
ground investigations.

The incident involving Chentis
Pettigrew Jr. was reported in the
same issue of the Pitt News. He
claimed he was humiliated bythe
Campus Police "and accused of
stealing his own car. But was he
humiliated because he was.appre-
hended for suspicious behavior,

"because he was black and therefore

irreproachable or because a man in
his position doesn’t need to respect
the sincere and viable efforts of our
police officers?

- If indeed the initial suspicions
against him were in error certainly
an apology was due. In retrospect,
the learned Pettigrew could have
taken an intelligent broad view of
the entire circumstance and taken

Stakes Laid On New
Folk Vocalist Sharp

 

I BY TOM WASELESKI ’

Just About Love, Randy Sharp
RCA Records, BEL 1-1390.

Deep down within every review-
er there’s a yen to be the ﬁrst to
pick up on a new artist who will be
a first-rate sensation within the
year. If I had a reputation to stake,
l’d lay it all on Randy Sharp, a
virtual unknown who has the gall to
bring us not only good, driving
music but also freshly poignant
lyrics.

He sings as plaintively as Jesse
Colin Young on the f ‘slow folk”
stuff, and can double as Don

,“American Pie” McLean on the

rock tunes. ‘This guy doesn't have
a musical fault, at least not in these
thirteen cuts—this being his ﬁrst
album—and his band is likewise
brilliant. No need for them to stay
in the background; they could
probably sell this record without
Sharp’s vocals-—but why sacriﬁce?

“Don’t Know How I Made It’’ is
a funky rocker, led by Jim
Hobson’s charging piano and some
great guitar licks by Jim Williams

sultry. starry night.

My favorites turned out to be the
blending of Ellington’s piano and
Jimmy Woode's droning, bowed
bass in the melodic, slow-stepping-
on-pond-rocks delicacy “The Sin.

gle Petal of a Rose"

Other outstanding moments on
this fine recording are the meshing
of diverse instrumental voices in
"Get-with-Itness" and “Some-
thing" and frantic boogie-swing of
\“Having At lt.” These are from
“The Goutelas Suite,” which tells
of the harmoney of humans
working together similar in mode to
the way “The Queen’s Suite" tells
of nature’s harmony.

“The UWIS (performed at the
University of Wisconsin) Suite” is
outstanding, particularly in the
second movement, “Klop,” and
the third, “Loco‘Madi.” “Klop” is
polka backwards and the precision,
melody and spirit of the polka

that could’ve stood in for George
Harrison’s on Abbey Road.

Another dazzler is “Let Your
Business Go,” only this one’s
a helluva lot meaner. At the start
the piano tinkles,_ yet Sharp’s
12-string sets up a pleasant
dissonance to suit’ the lyrics:
“Found him standing lost/So you
offered him a hand/ Said he needed
someone to understand/Now you
tell me that your hand/Isn't all you
ﬁnally gave.”

The song’s highlight is John
Davis’ pedal steel screaming
angrily in front of the tough
acoustic background. There’s no
country in that pedal at all, just
guts. A

On the mellower side is a title
track with good vocal harmonies,
distant piano and Arp strings.‘
Another folk tune is “Novocain
Lover,” a slow, -drunken ballad
with a melody as sincere and catchy
as Gordon Lightfoot’s best.

Almost disco‘ is “Mama Get
Ready,” the LP’s prime dance cut.
With congasland some light horn
arrangement in the background,
Sharp keeps his ribbon-smooth
voice, but rocks solidly enough to
get you out on the ﬂoor.

The album's best lyrics have to
be on “The Weekend.” Simple and
straightforward, uncluttered and
‘precise, Sharp knows how to play to
them, using only voice,_ piano, and
strings: “Hey, in the morning,
why don't we sleep in/Youcan call
up your girlfriend/Say. you're
staying the weekend./ We can
make coffee, we can make toast,
and love."

He can be lyrically humorous,
too, as he is on “Do We Really
Have to Dance?" a reggae tune
about one man's tight moments on
a crowded dance ﬂoor. “Don't
want no one at this party to
see/Don't want no one at this
party/To see that part of my

  Pirate PowerPounds R

BY GARY MIHOCES
AP Sports Writer

PITTSBURGH—Richie Zisk
slammed a pinch-hit, solo home
run in the eighth inning to give the
Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-4 victory
over the Cincinnati Reds Monday
night in a regionally-televised
power display that saw both sides
clout a total of seven solo homers.

Neither team had a hit through
the first four innings, and Pirates’
starting pitcher Bruce Kison led,
1-0, on a no-hitte’r through six after
the Pirates scored an unearned run
off Reds’ starter Jack Billingham.

But by game’s end, the two
teams had matched the major
league record for most solo homers
by two teams in a single
nine.-inning game. The total of

seven was last equalled by the
Chicago White Sox and Cleveland
Indians in 1974.

In the seventh inning alone, the
Pirates assaulted Billingham with
three solo homers.

Al Oliver and Willie Stargell hit
back-to-back homers to almost the
same spot in the right ﬁeld seats to
open the inning, and one out later,
Bill Robinson drove another home
run over the left ﬁeld wall.

It was the ninth homer in 22
games for Robinson, who also had
three here in a Saturday night loss
to‘ San Diego. ,He took only a few
steps from home plate while

watching the ball clear the fence. ‘
Cincinnati’s Joe Morgan count-
ered to open the Reds’ seventh
when he jolted a homer to right, the
third hit of the game off Kison.

- What happened to the Pitts-
burgh Triangles Saturday night at
the Civic Arena was not unlike
what has been happening to them
all season, as they lost another

close match. A tiebreaker game in

the ﬁnal set decided the match as
the San Diego Friars beat the
Triangles, 28-26, giving Pittsburgh
a 5-12-record and a longer lease on
last place in the Eastern Division of
World Team Tennis (WTT).

Part of the Triangles’ problem
was player-coach Mark Cox's
decision ‘to put third-stringer
Bernie Mitton and newly reacquir-
ed Sue Stap in the mixed-doubles
lineup to face a hot Ross Case and
Bettyann Stuart with San Diego
leading, 21-20, going into the Set.
Mitton aced a few, while Stap just
kept hitting the ball into the net.
Her last too-low shot decided the
ﬁnal point of the tiebreaker, giving
the Friars the game, 5-3, and the
set, 7-6.

The only bright spot for the
Triangles came when Evonne
Goolagong defeated Terry Holla-
day, 6-2, giving the Triangles their
biggest lead, 13-8.

In the opening set. Goolagong
and _Peggy ‘Michel narrowly beat
Holladay and Bettyann: Stuart, 7-6.

Triangle owner Frank ‘Fuhrer A

voiced his disapproval of his team's
play after the loss.

“Every team in the league has
improved and has become more
competitive except the Triangles.
The only player who is doing an
outstanding job is Evonne.‘ The

Peggy, .'V_itas. and. . .

Mark, aren't doing a good job at i

all. They’re getting worse. JoAnne
(Russell) and Bernie are not
improving to the level where they
could cover up if a player slumps,”
Fuhrer said.

In the eighth, Pete Rose tagged
Kison for another solo homer to
lead off the inning and, one out
later, Morgan slammed his second
homer of the game to right ﬁeld to

‘trim the Pirate lead to 4-3.

Tony Perez then singled to chase
Kison, and George Foster followed
with a single to right that was
misplayed by Parker, allowing
Perez to score the tying run.

Zisk stepped to the plate in the
bottom of the inning and drove the
first pitch from Cincinnati reliever
Will McEnaney over the left ﬁeld
wall for the game-winning homer.

The first Pittsburgh run came in
the sixth when Frank Taveras led
off with a single. Taveras stole
second and continued to third when
catcher Bill’ Plummer’s throw

Clock Ticking Downf

  For Struggling 
  Pitt Skaters

BY STEVE SYBERT —
The Student Government Board's (SGB) recent recommendation to‘

the Allocations Committee to cut in half the Pitt Hockey'Club’s ;_i 

proposed operating budget leaves me somewhat disgruntled.

As a promoter of sports and a lover of hockey, I would like to see the
Hockey Club make it. I have always thought that in years past this
same situation involved both the Pitt football and basketball teams.

After all, they too had to start somewhere, just as the Hockey Club is.‘ I.  

presently trying to.do. _ ,

The building of Pitt Stadium more than 50 years ago kicked off a long
tradition of football excellence at the University. The basketball team
staged its games in the stadium, too, and when they hungered for ’a
better facility, why, of course, the Field House was built.

Supposedly, the construction of a new sports arena on campus, with

the possible inclusion of an ice surface, is ﬁve years away. Athletic. . 
Director Casimir Myslinski has maintained the reason he will not fund . 
the club is not because of lack of money (he did contribute $1,000 from .

the athletic department for last season), but rather because there are
no campus facilities for the sport.

If, however, a rink is ﬁve years away, what then will be the plans for 1131 I

having a varsity hockey team at Pitt? And if that does come true, what
will happen to the team in the interim?

If Allocations decides to honor the SGB recommendation and cuts
the club’s funding through the student activities fee to 25% of their
proposed budget, then who, besides the players themselves, will be_

counted on to take up the slack? What if the SGB’s effort to pass the C ' I 

buick to the athletic department is not successful? If Pitt hockey goes’
down the drain this year, what sense is there in trying to revive it five.
years from now?

Or maybe I'm raising too many questions and “what-ifs.” Two’, , I 
years ago the Hckey Club won 19 games. Many of the top high‘ school ‘ l: ‘-
players in this area saw the success of the program and found their

Unless the Hockey Club is given a lifeline to maintain it‘ until a, . in

the endless night.

The train has to stop sooner or '
later and what better place to rest  

than ajumpin’ little cabaret with
pianist Joe Turner. These new

recordings by the 69-year-old 

pianist express a joy you can feel
deep in your laughing belly.’ The
raucous piano style made popular
by Thomas “Fats” Waller ﬁnds a
home on Turner’s 88s. This kind of

' eloquent boogie music is happiness

in sound rarely found in the work of
many contemporary pianists.
The material is diverse, ranging
from a combination Scottish fling
and melody from “Please Don’t
Talk About Me When I’m Gone” in
Earl Hines’ “Rosetta” to “Song of
the Vagabonds” from Czech-Amer-
ican composer Rudolf Friml’s 1925
operetta, .“The Vagabond King.”
It's a pleasure to ﬁnd a strong-, new
interpretation of “I’m Gonna Sit
Right Down And Write Myself A
Letter.” Turner’s own “Harry
Numa” evokes images of the
tough, bald Eric von Stroheim
prowling Paris in the foggy
morning.
Whether you’re alone or with
friends, Turner will ﬁll the room
with joy.

Chalk up another entry into the

gloriﬁed folk amateurs who are
merely hopping on the bandwagon,
this is ﬁrst-rate stuff.

If you didn’t know better, you’d
think this was Poco in the good ol’
days before Richie Furay bolted to
form Souther-Hillman-Furay.

The Pousette-Dart Band has the
ﬂashy, twangy, country z‘ip that
Poco’s been struggling to recapture
in the last threeor four albums,
and there, too, the musical force of
the group lies in the efforts’ of one

He writes nine of the ten cuts on
the album, sings lead vocals and
delivers the showcase guitar licks
on electric, acoustic and slide.

“Woman in My Dreams” is a
kinky, torrid tune with congas and
the humidity of Pousette-Dart’s
lead vocal a la Jesse Colin Young.
Wait ’till those steamy 78-degree

midnights-—this cut’s gonna melt ‘
‘your diamond stylus.

A nice touch of moog stretches
the track out and also provides a

respite from the vOcal’s countrgl-:.:

drawl, which any hick—rock fan
knows can become as burdensome
as a bale of hay.

Some more moog accents are
used in “Freezing Hot," probably
the best cut on the record. With
heavy bass and strong backing

. vocals, this is a sweeping country

tune that’s bound to carry you back
to your last sunny walk through a
green ﬁeld.

“What Can I Say” is the shiny
opening track. Pousette-Dart’s
electric and John Curtis’ acoustic
play a summery middle eight off
each other, with Kenneth Buttrey’s
percussion effectively punctuating,

as it does on the rest of the albun;_.._—\
On the funky side is 5‘All Youw‘

beautiful refrain equal in mastery
to Poco’s “Crazy Eyes.”

“What You Need” is the

Though not as expertly
rendered as theother songs, it’s

Not a bad cut in the album, and
