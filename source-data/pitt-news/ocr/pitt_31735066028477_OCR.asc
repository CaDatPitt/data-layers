Lothrop fitness room "in the works"

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

Construction of a fitness
center in Lothrop hall is
underway and should be com-
pleted by Jan. 1.

At an estimated final cost of
between $150,000 and
$200,000, the center will fea-
ture new fitness equipment
and a shower facility.
According to Vice Chancellor
of Student and Public Affairs
Leon Haley, the new center
will be a bargain.

“There had to be construc-

,tion done to create the shower

areas, and all the equipment
we are getting is brand new,”
Haley says. “It will be the
kind of quality facility that
our students are used to.” ‘
Tara Construction, which
had the lowest bid in a recent
proposal to the university, has
crews working full time on
the site. The construction
supervisor, Larry DiFran-
cesca, says there have been
no problems encountered and
the crew should be done by
December. . . 
The purpose for the con-

struction is to install showers
and locker rooms for men and
women. The original cost of
the construction was sup-
posed to be approximately
$45,000, but plumbing prob-
lems for the shower facility
were encountered, and the
new cost will be approximate-
ly $83,000.

Betsy Sallade-Farina, direc-
tor of food services, says that
since Lothrop is an older
building, all the drains and
plumbing needed to be retro-
fitted to work.

“Though this is taking
longer than originally
planned, the completion of
this facility is occurring only
one semester after it was for-
mally proposed by the
Student Government Board,”
says Sallade—Farina.

Last May, the SGB present-
ed a signed petition to the
university requesting a fitness
center on the lower campus.
Presently,Trees Hall is the
only fitness center on cam-
pus, but it is located at the top
of “cardiac hill” above the
stadium, making it inconve-
nient to access.

 

   

John DiVitto, vice chancel-
lor for business and finance,
says there will be no addition-
al charges to students using
the facility, and the hours of
operation will be long to
accommodate the busy sched-
ules of students.

Sallade-Farina says the

facility is funded by the
Office of the Provost, Student
Affairs and the Office of

Business and Finance. She

says all of these offices are
very excited about the facili-
ty.
“This will be a beautiful
facility,” says Sallade-Farina.

Pitt student sneaks
into Lothrop Hail

Without any problems or
obstructions, a reporter for
The Pitt News, who does not
have access privileges to
Lothrop Hall, entered the
building via the rear loading
dock and took an elevator ride
onto the resident floors.

He left notes on some of the
students’ doors, letting them
know someone who didn’t

they live.

At the past production of “Hamlet” by the
Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival, a dagger
fight between two characters brought the crowd a
little too close to the action. A dagger got hung
up on the doublet of the actor’s costume and flew
from his sweaty hand into the crowd, hitting a
woman in the face.

and choreographer of the

show’s duel, has made sure
his actors put in many hours
of rehearsal.

“Each movement of the
sword is like a line of dia-

logue,” he says.

Objectives and obstacles
confront every move just as
they do every word._

Bob Kupperman, a senior
theater arts major who plays
Danceny, and Zander Teller, a
local Pittsburgh actor who
plays Valmont, duel over two
women with whom their
have become
entangled. The actors
rehearsed every day since
rehearsals began six weeks
ago.

The actors have done some

   

stage fighting in the past —
Teller in “The Illusion” by
Corneille at Stanford
University and Kupperman in
Pitt’s production of “Tis a
Pity She’s a Whore.” They
started by aiming their
swords a foot or so from the
intended point of contact. As
the choreographed move-
ments became more familiar,
the aim moved to a few inch-
es of the intended mark,
increasing the risk, but mak-
ing it look more realistic.

A challenge the actors
encountered was adapting to
a more confined area once the
fight was moved onto the
stage. But in rehearsal, Teller
found a way to work it into
the performance.

suggested that dueling was
probably illegal, and there-
fore best done in a concealed
space. “Work it into the char-'
acter” was Teller’s sugges-
tion.

Keeping history in mind is
a major part of choreograph-
ing a duel, Coleman says.
Coleman first began dueling
in 1968 and has worked with
trainers at the New York
Shakespeare Festival, the
National Shakespeare
Festival and in London with
the renown stage fight chore-
ographer, William Hobbs,
whose credits range from
Laurence Olivier’s “Othello”

when staging a duel. First is
safety, then dramatic action
—— the sequence of events in
the story, third is historical
accuracy and fourth is logic.

Although learning the
mechanics of a duel are what
keeps it safe, the actors must
also learn grace. Anticipating
where your partner is going
to attack, but not letting it
show, is part of the difficulty,
Teller says.

Teller and Kupperman also
had to learn the correct form
for dueling. The angle at
which the knees are bent,

the head held high are all fac-

like a dance. The whole
process is a lot like a ballet,
Kupperman says.

The actors also must con-
sider the honor and nobility
that was attached to dueling
in this period. There was a
definite dueling etiquette.

“Aside from trying to kill
each other,” Kupperman said,

“they were trying to do things ‘

with a touch of class.”

the same one the construction
crews, who are not university
personnel, use to access the
building.

Sgt. Charles Grier, the com-
munity relations officer at Pitt,
says it’s common for him to
investigate security problems
at university buildings when
asked to do so by the housing
office. In this case, Grier was
not called.

Leon Haley, assistant vice-
chancellor for student and
public affairs and a member of
the housing office, did receive
a phone call. Later that day he
rode the elevator and found
the same security problems.

“Previously the construction

site was a cafeteria,” says
Haley. “The workers there had
no need to take the elevator
beyond the first ﬂoor, so it was
locked. Apparently, since then,
the restraints put on the eleva-
tor were removed.”
' Haley had the locks put back
on the elevator, and now the
situation is secure for the resi-
dents of Lothrop.

Grier was called to check
Lothrop a few hours after
Haley left. Grier suggested
giving the workers access
badges and sending a memo to
all the residents of Lothrop,
ensuring that all residents are
aware of the construction
workers in their building.

One Lothrop resident says
there have been prior security
problems in the building.

“I was walking through the
halls and an old lady stopped
me and asked where
Presbyterian Hospital was,”
the student says. “She said she
was the grandmother of a stu-
dent that worked there. I have
no idea how She was allowed
to get on my floor.”

Haley says responding to
problems of security is
extremely important to the
welfare of Pitt students.

“Apathy." said John Callahan,

Two years ago when the clock

Pitt News complaining, he said.

“However, when Vice
President Al Gore came in
September, no one ranted and
raved,” said Callahan.

Greek status was a hot topic at
last night’s session.

“The Greeks are just an organi-
zation,” said Callahan, “Greeks
are the same as non-Greeks.
There are good people and bad
people like in any group.”

“There are definitely candi-
dates here with solid ideas and
experience, but there are more
than a few without,” said Julie
Crowell, SGB president, at the
end of last night’s meeting. ‘‘I
challenge [the candidates] within
the next week to do investigation
and research and show people
what you’re made of.”-

The Neon Bible
Directed by Terence Davies
(UK, 92 min.)

A postcard-colored
Cinemascope dream of ‘a
movie, whichfloats effortlessly
through the moods and memo-
ries of its central character, The
Neon Bible calls up visions of a
small Southern town in the
1930s and '40s. A young boy
feels there must be more to life;
his gaudy, boozing, show-biz-
loving Aunt Mae (Gena
Rowlands) becomes his symbol
of that something more.

The Mystery of Rampo
Directed by Kazuyoshi
Okuyama

(Japan, 93 min.) ,_

This slick story starts when
the author reads an article in the
newspaper about a woman who
has killed her husband. When
he goes to meet this woman, he
discovers she is identical to his
character, and this inspires him
to write a sequel that involves
the woman being held captive
by a kinky man — and this is
where fiction and reality begin to

The Hemp Revolution
Written and Directed by Anthony Clarke
(Australia,72 min.)

I know you’re thinking mary jane, pot,
ganja, sense, chronic, herb, dope,
grass, weed, craig, smoke — but did
you know that rope, clothing, "paper,
seed oil, paint, sailcloth and even the
very‘first pair of Levi’s can be and were
made of hemp?

«While most of this film is just a sec-
ond-rate rehash of the whole legalize
hemp movement’s arguments couched
once again in clichéd hippy-dippy horse-
shit, filmmaker Anthony Clarke does
move past this elementary stuff in the
film’s second half. Clarke’s huge cast of

talking head experts begin to expose‘

exactly why any growth of the hemp
plant, whether for medical research or
the no-THC variety for use in fiber
industries, is totally illegal in the United
States. As one author says, marijuana
simply does not produce an effect on
the individual which will be tolerated in a

capitalist society. Pot does not produce '

the kind of neurotic conspicuous con-
sumers and automaton workers that fuel

    

this country’s economy. Now, caffeine
on the other hand  5

Clarke also details the historical cam-
paign of the ban on hemp from other
angles. DuPont Chemical’s patented
pulp wood to paper process left the
cleaner, cheaper hemp to paper
process a target of the industrial giant.
Just like any conversion to alternative
fuels, the legalization of hemp threatens
an already existing industry with a
cheaper and safer way of doing things.
This ensures that the industry in place
will do everything possible to quash any
change in prohibition laws.

Despite Clarke’s corny optimism
mixed with a silly world beat wanna-be
soundtrack, the real answer by film’s
end is that hemp is simply too threaten-
ing to the powers that be to ever be
legalized. So even if Clarke had done
something truly revolutionary and not
just preached to the converted, it looks
like the squares, who seem to be run-
ning the show more and more these
days, willcontinue to hinder your high
with incarceration paranoia and pollute
your body with pesticides from your cot-

tonclothing. .

Odile and Yvette at the Edge of the
World

Directed by Andre Burke

With Karen Skloss and Heather Roheim

The pill Odile takes at the beginning
of At the Edge of the World was bunk if
it was supposed to be acid. Andre
Burke's idea of fun is a pretty boring
Wonderland, a flat-out ‘60s giddy-romp
cliché that makes Heavenly Creatures
seem pretty sharp.

Odile and Yvette are two sisters who
begin their vapid day-tripping in the
back seat of Daddy's station wagon, but
jump out of the car and run through the
corn fields to escape his crossword puz-
zle droning. Yvette Ieads Odile through
the woods to a drainage pipe — their
doorway to fairy-tale land, where they
look through kaleidoscopes, hallucinate
and spin themselves silly. The camera
shows us all these cliches with the
cheapest of effects. It spins when they
spin, shows the girls’ hallucination with
really" obviousediting and splash water

on each other and then jump rope.

“You just have to want something,
then you can have whatever you want,”
Yvette insists. The redundant dialogue
rehashes Yvette’s never-neverland
mantra five gazillion times with the wis-
dom of high school journal keepers: ‘‘It
has to be important — what you really
want," ‘‘If you want, I can get you one,"
and “Did you get what you wish for?"
And what they (want are — what else —
boys. Cute boys. And since this takes
place at the edge of the world, you'd
better make that's dark-skinned boys,
like Johnny-the-Indian. Cuz, ya know, .
what’s at the edge of the world if not
Native-Americans, and to two school girl
nymphettes those bravehearts are real-
ly, really cute!!! The press kit’s descrip-
tion of Johnny comes straight out of
your little sister's Sweet Valley _High
paperbacks: “part teen rocker, part
wood nymph, Johnny embodies Odile’s
idea of ‘cool."’ Seems like this Danny
Wahlberg cum flutey Pan is every teen's

‘idea of sweetie-pie. Riight? Right? Are

.Dear Abby N .

 

Now comes the part where with
my stunning foresight, I offer a lit-
tle advice to bands who may be
planning to tour themselves by
explaining how we did it.

How Did They Do It?

Let me start by saying
this,:nyone that wants to tour,
can. Being in a punk rock band
gave us a serious advantage,
(although my guess is that this
applies to almost all underground
scenes) because punk rock is
such a close. knit sub culture.
We simply called punk rocker
friends we knew from other
bands and asked them for’ num-
bers of people they knew in other
cities whoput on shows.‘ After
acquiring those numbers it was
just a matter of sitting down and
making millions of calls that
went something like this, “Hi. I’m
Punk Rock Justin in Pittsburgh
Pa. I got your number from Punk
Rock Susie in Cleveland, and
she said that you might be able
to help my band Anti-Flag get a
show in your town.”

We've playedand kept in con-
tact with national acts such as
The Queers (NH), Youth Brigade
(CA), Avail (VA), etc., who were
happy to help us get shows and
make contacts in other cities.
Not to mention Pittsburgh bands
like Aus_ Rotten, Sub Machine,
Worm Hole, Bad Genes, etc.
(who, in some cases, are proba-
bly more popular out of town
than in) were extremely helpful in
getting us booked. Many people
don'tt:realize the extremely good

reputation Pittsburgh bands have.

on the national circuit. We had
kids who said they came to see
us not because they had heard
of us, but because we were from
Pittsburgh.

Underground publications such
as Book Your Own Life (found
in many independent record
stores), or the p-line (punk rock
internet) are helpful to touring
bands. We met bands who had
booked their whole tour that way.

A PL_A§§_0N THE WES!1rmp.i:www.acoventura.corr\l

 

if your band IS big enough you
could probably get picked up by

a booking agent. But keep in
mind that once you take that
route you loose a great deal of
control over the terms under
which you play. We would rather
put forth the effort and do it our-
selves. (On the other hand, my
feeling is that if you can find the
right booking agent for your
band’s needs, it could probably
be almost as effective.)

One more thing to keep in
mind. Clubs and promoters are
almost always in it for the money.
Kids are in it for the cause. In
the end, shows put on and pro-
moted by kids are almost always
better! Promoters or clubs will
often book you onto an over
twenty one bill where they make
money from" alcohol and the
bands play to a couple of people
who don’t care who is playing.
(While the kids who want to see
you sit outside trying to listen
through the walls.)

Let’s Go On Tour
If you ever decide to tour with a
band, the success of the tour
can’t be measured on whether
you make a little bit of money or
whether you score a record deal
if at the end of the tour you hate
the members of your band so
much that your band breaks up.
With that in mind, here are
some touring tips that you and
your band members may want to
consider before you hit the road:
1.. Stay away from situations that
bother you as much as possible.
If need be, go sit in a coffee
house by yourself for a couple of
hours. 2. Talk about anything
that your associates may be
doing that bothers you right
away. Don't sit on it for three
weeks letting it slowly build up to
the point where you want to kill
each other. 3. Once you’ve
talked about it, let it go. It's
over. Move on. Get over it! 4.
As hard as it may be, try to be
accommodating toward one

another. That can be the differ-
ence between fist fights and gun
fights.

Tour Length

Concerning the subject tour
length, I have to reiterate the
advice given to Anti-Flag by our
good friend Sean Genes, (previ-
ously of the magnificent and
now sadly defunct Bad Genes,
and now the bassist for power

pop punker than !#%* rockers,

I
I-.


ii

The Loveless), “Don‘t go out for
any longer than five weeks!”

As embarrassed as I am to
admit it, in a fit of insanity we
underestimated Sean's punk
rock wisdom and decided to go
out for seven weeks.
Personally, I still haven’t recov-
ered from that mistake. Our
thinking was that we had toured
before with time spent on the
west and east coasts respective-
Iy. But there is a big difference
between a week or two and
seven weeks. With that in mind,
unless you’re hoping to return
from your first major tour a com-
plete psychological and physical
mess, do yourself a favor and go
out for no more than five weeks.
(When you get home be sure to
send a thank you card to Sean
Genes.)

Promotion
The best and really the only
promotion for an underground

punk band is to release your a

music with hopes that the major
zines will review it (hopefully in a
favorable light!), and college
radio stations will play it. That is
precisely what we did (thanks to
the tireless work of both Brian
Lauer at Self Serve Records and
Sean Genes), and with good
reviews in zines such as
Maximum Flock ‘n’ Roll, Heart
Attack, etc., we had kids coming
to see us just because they read
the record reviews or heard us
on their local college radio sta-
tions.

Canceled Shows
lt’s inevitable, there are going
to be shows that you have had
booked for three months cancel
out on you. We did one of two
things. 1. Depending on our
geography, we took advantage
of the situation and went to the
beach. (As a matter of fact, if
we didn’t have a show in New
England cancel on us we
would’ve never gotten to see
that irreplaceable historical mon-
ument to Americana, gleefully
referred to as Plymouth Rock!)
2. If there’s another show within
driving distance, and you’re
aware of it, you may want to try
and jump on that bill. While we
really didn’t have a problem with
canceled shows, we did see a
number of bands successfully
.try to jump on bills on which we
were booked to play.

Doesn't Money Fuckin’ Suck?

As much as I'd rather not, I
have to comment on the
almighty evil of evils, money. I’d
love to say fuck worrying about
money, this is punk rock, this is

3; anarchy. And while that might

be true to a certain extent, anar-
chy doesn’t put food in your
mouth and gas in the tank. (or
toes it?)

Most tours are complete fail-
ires because of money prob-

Mallrats
Written and Directed by Kevin
Smith

With Shannen Doherty and
Jason Lee

I can see how this probably
happened:

With a black-and-white, criti-
cally acclaimed cheapie called
Clerks under his belt,
writer/director Kevin Smith is
approached by a film company
offering higher production val-
ues, more advertising publicity
and a well-known actress for the
starring role.

On one condition: tone down
the language. (Clerks barely
escaped an NC-17 rating for its
language use.)

Clerks was a low-budget
comedy about a convenience
store clerk whose life is going to
hell within an eight-hour time
span and, as far as I’m con-
cemed, was one of the funniest
films of the year.

Since it was Smith’s gift for
weaving harsh profanity and
graphic sexual language into
realistic conversations, the less-
ening of this element extracts
much of the potency that could
have made this film just as good
— if not better —— than its prede-
cessor.

Mallrats, Smith’s sophomore
effort, pales in comparison to his
first effort. The movie follows two
friends named Brodie and T.S.

out as they complain about their
girl troubles, run into some old
friends and get into a lot of trou-
ble. The oddball acquaintances
that these two encounter are
one of the elements that keeps
the film from failing completely,
most notably the sexy ex-flame
of T.S.’ (who openly tries on inti-
mate attire while carrying on a
conversation) and a whacked-
out mallrat who grows more and
more outraged from failing to
see the image in those damned
3-D pictures. ‘ I
Smith’s new film may be in
color, it may have been much
more advertised and it may star
Shannen Doherty (of “Beverly
Hills, 90210" fame), but itonly
garners about half of the laughs
in Clerks, and the harsher lan-
guage use that made that movie
so funny is only hinted at a few
times here. As a result, Clerks’

 

profane, pothead duo Jay and
Silent Bob (Smith himself) have
nothing to do in Mallrats, except
a few mildly amusing slapstick
antics. And Doherty fans (if there
are any) take note: the ex-
90210er is in and out of the film
for about 15 minutes altogether.
The only other thing that
saves Smith’s movie from
drowning is his talent for writing
dialogue, which his characters
spew at such a frenetic pace

that it’s sometimes hard to keep '

up with. And his little in-jokes will
only appeal to those who have
seen Clerks. Perhaps if you are
a mallrat yourself and you’re
faced with as much time to
waste as the slacker buds that
inhabit the film, you’|I give
Mallrats a chance. Otherwise,
check this one out on video.

-anti-flag from 5
lems. Usually because bands
expect to make a lot of money
from the door at the gigs
they’re playing.’ However,
anyone who has toured for
more than a weekend will tell
you that contrary to popular
belief, touring bands don’t
make shit off of the door at
shows. You need to have
merchandise to sell! It’s your
life line! I can’t stress that
enough! Whatever you sell in
t-shirts, tapes, etc., is more or
less what you are going to
make that night. Without mer-
chandise, you will most likely
starve.

Luckily, we never even
came close going broke or
running low on cash as a
result of all of the good bills
we were playing. On the
other hand, without merchan-
dise to sell at those shows we
would've gone belly up in
about two weeks. Unless
you’re Fugazi (and I doubt

   

 

 

  

you are) make sure you stock
up before you hit the road.
And if you’re going to be on
the road for an extended
amount of time, be sure to
have a plan to have merchan-
dise sent to you as you run
out.

That’s All Folks

Well that's about all there is

to tell. I hope you got some-
thing out of this article aside
from a headache. Honestly, I
don’t know what more you
could ask for? A little on the
road excitement, a couple of
touring tips, and a feeling in
your stomach that has you
running for the nearest bath-
room. What more in life is
there?

I'd like to close by urging
that before you sit around
whining and complaining that
there is nothing going on in
this city you go to shows with
local bands and be supportive
of the local music scene as

  

much as you possibly can.
After all, if you want some-
thing to happen, you have to
make it happen. If you’re so
unbelievably alternative, than
why don’t you PROVE lT!! All
talk and no action equals zero
you know? And there are
people in this city that are try-
ing, but they can’t do it alone.

My suggestion to you is that
for every mainstream, even
“under ground main stream”
show that you go to, go see
one show with local bands.
After all, a music scene, even
a great music scene is impos-
sible to build with out local
support. More than that, you
may just find that you’re miss-
ing out on something you
might really enjoy. How many
people do you think were sit-
ting around crying that there
was nothing to do in Berkeley
while Operation Ivy were
down the street rocking 924
Gilman to the ground?

Opinions

  I Allegheny county coup

Tuesday night Allegheny County made history. For the first
time in 60 years the Allegheny Board of Commissioners will be
comprised of a Republican majority. Larry Dunn and Bob
Cranmer will serve as majority commissioners, and Mike
Dawida will serve as minority commissioner. (These results are
pending due to the request for a recount of votes, since Cranmer
only beat his Democrat opponent, Coleen Vuono, by approxi-
mately 300 votes.) '

During the primary elections, Dunn and Cranmer made a lot
of promises. Among other things, they promised to cut property
taxes in the county by 20 percent on the first day they take
office. They also‘ promised to freeze property tax assessments
for fiveyears, and to eliminate useless management positions
created during Tom Foerster and Pete Flaherty’s patronage sys-
tem of government.

The most surprising thing about Dunn and Cranmer’s victory
is that they crossed party lines to win the election. Support for

’ the Republican team came from Democrats as well as

Republicans. The only good explanation for that is that people
wanted change, and Dunn and Cranmer made promises which

. will change this county for the better if they are kept.__

Well, Tuesday night the winds of change swept over this

_county like a tornado. Allegheny now has a new government '
' and a new majority party. Hopefully, the winds won’t die down

over the next two years. This county is finally facing a turn-

, around in the economic crisis it is currently in. Dunn and

Cranmer had better hope they can fulfill their promises if they
don’t want to face their own crises.

  Holocaust remembered

Tonight at 8:30 on the patio of William Pitt Union there will
be a candlelight vigil held in honor‘ of Kristallnacht. For anyone
who does not know what Kristallnacht is, the word means
“night of the broken glass.” Kristallnacht symbolizes the night
Nazi troops invaded the Jewish ghettos, smashing glass and
hope, destroying property and lives. It was the beginning of the
Holocaust. — ’

In recent years, there have been more and more people com-

: ing out and saying things like “the Holocaust wasn’t as bad as

people say,” or “there weren’t really 6 million Jews killed.”

In fact, the much talked about Rev. Louis Farrakhan once said
that the Holocaust is God punishing the Jews, and if they aren’t
careful it will happen again.

Any reasonable, logical human being with an IQ over 2 knows
that statements like those are ridiculous. The Holocaust (lid
happen, and 6 million Jews and other Europeans were murdered.

$One of the reasons Kristallnacht is important is so that nothing

like it ever happens again. A
So tonight go to the union and see what’s going on. If you
know everything there is to know about the Holocaust, go — go

A and share your knowledge. If you don’t know too much about it,

you might learn something.

In honor of those who served

This weekend we owe it
to our veterans to take
time off to remember
their dedication, service and
commitment to our great
nation. On Nov. ll the nation
will pause briefly to thank
veterans of the armed forces
of America. It is a time for
veterans to embrace one
another and remember their
sacrifices and those who are
no longer with us. It is a time
for the nation to say “thank

. you” and focus on the service -

of others, in this time of self-
ish, “you owe me” mentality,
this time has been dedicated
to those who gave and earned
the thanks they receive.
Veterans are the unseen,
unheard and unthanked mem-
bers of our society, and they
deserve recognition on this
special day to honor their
commitment to the nation
and each other. We owe it to
each other to remember our
sacrifices and our survival.
We have overcome personal
differences and adversity to
emerge, oftentimes damaged,
on the other side of an expe-
rience few outside the mili-
tary can possibly envision.
We are men and women
from all walks of life. We are
members of all religions,
races and creeds. We are
black, white, Asian,
Hispanic, Indians and Irish.
We are straight or gay, mar-
ried, single or divorced.
When we met in our barracks
we had come from country
clubs and ghettos, city slick-
ers and rednecks, educated
and uneducated. All the

diversity in the country can ,

be found in a basic training
facility, and each of us
learned to put aside old ideas
to learn to work together for
a common goal, to survive in
combat. Our‘ bond was a
common promise: to defend
the Constitution and the
country. In practical terms
this meant we would protect
and defend each other. We

_ Patrick
McKelvey

.tionships.

were members of elite fight-’

ing teams: Rangers and
ground crews, medics and
minesweepers, sailors and
engineers, nurses and para-
troopers, pilots and God-
bless—them-every—one
GRUNTS. We were all
pulling for a common goal,
not some “global policy” or
“higher morality.” We were
trying to stay sane and alive
intimes of war, and safe in
times of training.

We came to the armed
forces for different reasons.
Some of us came out of dedi-
cation and service to our
country and the belief that
the military was the way to
do that. Others came to
escape —— homes, neighbor-
hoods, no jobs or bad rela-
We came for
money for college or a fresh
start on life, andsome of us
have paid with our lives.
Whatever our reasoning, the
military only wanted one
thing from us all —- that we
do our job and do it well.
And for hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans this is
exactly what we have done
and are still doing. We often
labor in obscurity and
anonymity freezing on the
DMZ in Korea and sweating
in the sands of the Persian
Gulf.

Basically we share the ‘abil-
ity to say with PRIDE, “Been
there, done that, got the t-
shirt and I’m damn proud of

' it.” We" have, in this heyday

of the “Gimme!” generation,
given of ourselves, our time,
our lives and our freedom.
Yes, that’s right, freedom.
Members of the U.S. armed
forces enjoy less freedom
than does Joe—on-the-street.
We do not enjoy the right of
freedom of movement, and
certain speech, that the rest
of America takes for granted.
We have surrendered certain
freedoms in order to perform

what we see as our duty. In
an age of the free lunch we
have said we would pay the
ultimate price for the free-
dom of others.

It is an important distinc-
tion to remember on this hol-
iday that soldiers are not
politicians. We do not set
agendas, create policies or
execute any decisions not
originated by our elected
government. As members of
the armed services, we do not
have politics, we only have
the camaraderie of our broth-
ers and sisters in arms. And
on this day above all others it
is important to cherish, honor
and pay respect to that cama-
raderie.

The reason why I view this
as such a vital holiday is not
misguided nationalism, an
excuse to drink beer or what
some would label as patrio-
tism. Six years ago I joined
the army, and in it I found a
home — a place where dedi-
cation to duty, ability and
determination cut across all
boundaries, barriers and con-
fines of race, religion, gender
or economic background.
Those brothers I_ made I will
always have and love. We
have shared the ultimate

. fears and come back alive

because of each other.

So I take this moment now,
my fellow veterans of any
service, whether in combat or
in peacetime service, to
remind all of you that if no

one else says it to you this’ I

weekend, you have my heart-
felt thanks.

“For it is the soldier above
all others that abhors war and
prays for peace.”

soccer. Their conference record was 8-3. They tal-
lied 16 points, which placed them in second place in
the conference, one point behind No. 1 Boston
College.

This Friday, the 1995 Big East Men’s Soccer
Tournament will get underway. According to Pitt
soccer coach, Joe Luxbacher, Pitt is the most sur-
prising team in the tournament.

_“We were picked to end up 10th [in the presea-
son],” Luxbacher said.

Because of expansion,'for the first time in the
tournament, it will be the top eight teams in the con-
ference competing, instead of just the top four
teams. The teams receive a seed in the tournament
based on the outcome of their regular season. It is
set up so that the number one seed plays the number
eight seed, the number two seed plays the number
seven seed and so on.

This year’s season came down to the wire for a
lot of teams. Luxbacher said that until the last day
of the regular season, 11 out of 12 teams could have
gone. It came down to the ﬁnal whistle.

Boston College, who ﬁnished its season with an

8-1-1 record and 17 conference points, will be the
No. 1 seed in the tournament. The Eagles, ranked
24th in the nation, will be making their third con-
secutive appearance in the Big East Tournament.
But this is the first time they’re entering as the Big
East regular season champs.

The number two seed belongs to Pitt. This is only
the third time the Panthers have qualified for the
tournament. Luxbacher said that although they’re
going into the tournament as the second seed, they
feel they still have something to prove.

“It’s a very competitive league,” Luxbacher said.
“Any team could beat any team.”

Rutgers is the number three seed in the touma-
ment Rutgers was the coaches’ preseason favorite
to win the regular season. The Scarlet Knights ﬁn-
ished their season with a mark of 10-5 overall and
5-2-4 in conference play.

St. John’s, ranked 17th in the nation as of last
week, is the number four seed. St John’s played in
the championship game the last four years and has
won the last three.

Syracuse holds the number ﬁve seed, as it returns
to the tournament for the ﬁrst time since 1990.

The number six seed was claimed by
Georgetown, which ﬁnished out its regular season
with 11 conference points and an overall record of
8-9-2. Last year, the Hoyas were the regular season
champion and ﬁnished as the runner-up in the Big

. The Pitt News, Thursday, November 9, 1995

Former Panther great Tony Dorsett talks about Pitt
football, bottled water and Burger King cups

(Editors Note: This interview was conducted for The Pitt
News by Brad Isles, sports editor, and Mike Kovak, assis-
tant sports editor; the F riday before Pitts Homecoming
game against Miami. )

The Pitt News: What are the similarities or differences
between Johnny Majors now and when you played for
him?

Tony Dorsett: The difference is he’s older. I don’t know
because I’m not there ﬁrst hand, but I know that Anthony
would call me at times and ask me, ‘Dad, did Johnny use
to do things this way?’ I would say, ‘Anthony, you’ve got
to understand one thing, this is a new day and age. There
is a new approach to the game, there is a new attitude, a
new type of athlete nowadays. Sure, the way he did things
when I was coming up are a little different than the things
he’s doing now.’ We worked hard; we knew we had to
work hard. We had a squad committee that was the com-
municating arm between the players and the coaches.
Most of the things we suggested to him, we did. When we

_ went to a bowl game or something, he said, ‘Hey, this is

the reward for having a good year. I’m going to treat you
as men if you act like men." ' '

The coach is only as good as the players that play for
him. You can’t expect Johrmy Majors to work magic at
the University of Pittsburgh. It just doesn’t happen.

TPN: What do youthink about his future? It’s been three

’ years and the team hasn’t gotten anywhere.

' TD: For one thing, when I go back to Pitt and I look at the
‘ same facilities that were there when I was there, I would

say it would be pretty hard to get quality athletes to come
into an environment like that. And if you’re going to play
the Penn States, Notre Dames and the Michigans, you’ve

' got to be on the same level as them. You’ve gotta have the

same type of facilities. That new locker room they built is
a hell of a locker room. That’s a start.

Now everybody wants a winner, and that includes the
people here in Pittsburgh. They have become accustomed
to that since my era. There was a time when it was one of
the most prominent programs in the nation. And all of a,
sudden it fell off, and when it went down, it went way
down. -

. TPN: Does that disappoint you?

TD: Yes, very much so. Athletics is athletics. Let’s take it
from that standpoint first. If you want a football player, go

, get yourfootball player. Now, understand this about being

a student—athlete. It’s important for athletes today to get a
quality education, because if they don’t, after sports 
You know that’s short-lived. Then what do you do?

But it’s mighty funny to me, that being an alumnus at
the University of Pittsburgh, I can see Ohio State, I can

I see Penn State, USC, UCLA, Alabama, Georgia, I can see

all these universities being able to go out and get student-

upsets me that, it really pisses me off that I can

athletes, and Pitt can’t do it. Why? Where do .  _ . _
you start? You start at the top. What were the
coaches doing? One member of the coaching
staff here, when things were being told to me,
said, ‘We want to get the graduation rate of our
athletes up.’ Well that’s ﬁne and dandy, every-
body else is doing that. Why can’t Pitt? So
don’t try to get the percentages of graduation
up at the expense of your program.

I’m not taking anything away from gradua-
tion. Football programs support a lot of other
athletic programs at the university. It really

see these [other] guys are able to get student-
athletes that are both quality in- the classroom
and on the ﬁeld and Pitt can’t do it. Is it the
coaches falling back on their job? Who do you
point your finger at? They had them there
when I was there. They had them when
Marino was there. They had them there after
that. And then all of asudden, it falls off.
Something’s wrong there, man. There’s some
mud in this water, and I don’t know where it’s . A
at.

TPN: Do you think that some of it has to do with ‘

Oakland falling apart over the years, getting more crime?

TD: Oakland is not one of the better places to be. Pitt is
not a picturesque campus. This is the city, man, but that
isn’t running players away. Crime is everywhere, but
moreso in the city than in the rural areas. No, I don’t think
that’s the case. I just think that along the line, some of the
coaches didn’t do the job they were supposed to. I lmow
what Johrmy Majors is capable of doing —— I’m a product
of it. There’s quite a few who went through that era and
onto the next level who were quality students and were
able to go out there and do both.

It’s very upsetting to me to sit back and talk about Pitt
[being like it is]. That’s got to show something about Pitt
pride. And somehow it’s got to be brought back.

TPN: How did Pitt help prepare you for the NFL?

TD: I came into Pitt as a boy, and I left as'a young man.
There was a lot of growth that took place within those
four years. I was pretty much an introverted young man.
My communicating skills were difﬁcult I was just not a
guy who would open up, and I still don’t open up that eas-
ily to people. I almost wanted to drop out of school.
Thanks to Jackie [Sherril] and my mom, they talked me
out of it. They made me understand that the person I

‘would be hurting the most would be myself, and once I

realized that I was able to deal with staying in school.
I spent more time in Aliquippa my freshman year than I
did at Pitt. Once that transition took place, my mom
would call and ask me when I was coming home, then I
was enjoying being in the city. '

I didn’t know what I wanted to major in as a

freshman. I went from being a consensus All-
American as a freshman to being thrust into a
totally different lifestyle. I was at banquets with
the president, dinners with senators, lawyers,
congress people, I was thrust into a totally dif-
ferent life and it was like ‘damn, what am I
going to do?’ So I got into communications,
and that might have been one of the smartest
moves I’ve made. Getting up in front of people
and speaking was nerve racking, but shit, it
turned out to be a great move.

TPN: How was that? When you were sitting
3 there in that room with all of those people and
then they called your name, what was it like?

TD: It’s a hard feeling to describe. You’re
happy as hell, scared as hell, you’re frightened,
you’re happy —- it’s one heck of a feeling. And
to be singled out as the best collegiate athlete in
that particular year is quite an honor.

TPN: When I was a kid I remember watching
 the crowd going crazy, the players running
around the ﬁeld going nuts. What was it like
back then, because now it’s poor. Nobody goes
. to the games. There is no emotion.

 

Pat Bums/Staff Photographer

TD: You don’t see that fan support; you don’t see that
human snake that we used to run through all the time. It’s
disappointing. You don’t see the blue and white in the
stands. Man, I went to the Ohio State game and I thought
I was in Ohio. I walked out into the stadium and I
thought, ‘What the hell is this? Am I in Pittsburgh or
Columbus, Ohio?’ It’s disappointing to see that, but you
know, everybody likes a winner and the program has not
been winning. But you still have to have your faithful in
the stands. You don’t go from the outhouse to the pent-
house in two or three years. It doesn’t happen.

Players that are here have got to have pride too. You
can’t just show up and your attitude be ‘here we go
again.’ If something goes bad, ‘here we go again.’ Once
you have that kind of attitude, which can very easily hap-
pen, and if you get yourself caught up in that, and if
there’s not somebody there on that team to pull you out of
it, you give up. You become quitters. I don’t know if that’s
the case.

But, if you lose to Temple, shit, that made me mad as
hell.

TPN: How many games do you come to a year?

TD: This is Anthony’s last year, so I’ve been trying to
catch most of his home games. I don’t get involved very
much. I’ll tell him what I think he should do and how to
do it. Nowadays I think he pays more attention to whatl

tell him than when he was younger. I’m proud of what .

he’s developed into, proud to see him fulﬁll his dream of
being able to play and possibly the chance to go to the
next level. Anthony never wanted to get involved in
sports until his junior year of high school. He never
played football. Other people his age were much farther
ahead.

TPN: What kind of running back do you think he would
have been?

TD: He’s got a lot of athleticism. He was just never
involved as a youngster. A lot of that comes instinctively,
but if you haven’t been doing it as a kid all the way up, it’s
kind of tough to all-of-a—sudden put you out there because
you come from someone who could do it.

TPN: Do you think your presence on the sideline is a
motivator for the players?

TD: Not really. I don’t go out there and do that; it’s not
my style. When I see something good, I’ll be one of the
guys to congratulate them and to tell them to keep up the
good work. I just try to let the guys just see me there and
let them know that I can appreciate what they’re trying to
do. I don’t try to interfere with what the coaches are trying
to do.

TPN: What was it like to come back as a Cowboy and
play against the Steelers?

TD: It was a great feeling. That was my ﬁrst start my

Well-rested Panthers
Iuosl angry Orangemen

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt football coach Johnny Majors said last
weekend was one of his most enjoyable of the sea-
son.

The only problem was there wasn’t a football
game last weekend. '

The vacation is now over, and the hungry
Syracuse Orangemen (6-2) are eager to take on the
2-7 Panthers.

The game, which kicks off at noon Saturday,
will be the last home game for the Pitt seniors who
came to the school under the Paul Hackett regime.

They will have to be attheir best if the Panthers
are goingto end their seven-game skid.

“Syracuse is a gifted team,” Majors said. ‘They
are very talented, particularly on offense.”

One player Majors was referring to is Syracuse’s
dangerous freshman quarterback Donovan
McNabb. He leads the high-octane Orangeman
offense that averages almost 30 points a game.

On the Panthers’ side of the ball, injuries are still
the main setback. Running back Chris Patton is

-doubtful and QB Pete Gonzalez is out for the sea-

son. Majors is undecided on who will start in place
of Gonzalez — senior John Ryan or freshman Matt
Lytle.

“There is a likelihood that both quarterbacks will
play,” Majors said. “John Ryan has very good lead-
ership on the ﬁeld, and Matt Lytle is a good ath-

Majors said one of the keys to the game will be
turnovers.

“Takeaways are the best way to increase your
chances to win,” he said. “We have several this
year, but our gifts have been inordinately bad.”

The Panthers haven’t given up all hope on the
1995 season," one that some thought would land
them in a bowl game. Majors said the team is still
practicing hard.

“I think our practice attitude has been excellent;
we just need to play on Saturdays the way we’ve
practiced.” ’ ’

Syracuse is looking at Pitt as a chance to take out
its frustration from last week’s 31-7 pounding by
Virginia Tech.

Along with McNabb, the Orangemen will be
looking for big games from senior wide receiver
Marvin Harrison and junior running back Malcom
Thomas, who’s averaging 4.2 yards a carry and has
four touchdowns.

Defensively, the Orangemen are lead by line-
backer Antwaune Ponds and free safety Donovin
Darius. Ponds has a tearn-leading 107 tackles, and
right behind him is Darius with 104. Strong safety
Darrell Parker and comerback Kevin Abrams lead
the team with ﬁve interceptions.

Last year Pitt traveled to the Carrier Dome and
got soundly beaten by the Orangemen, 31-7.
Syracuse compiled over 600 total yards on offense
and scored 17 unanswered points in the second
quarter to pull away. Pitt leads the all-time series
record, 25-22-3.

It's the end of the
road for some seniors

 

: Columnist
Matt
Grove

e Panthers play their
ﬁnal home game of the
season Saturday when

they host Syracuse. The
Panthers havn’t had much suc-
cess with the Orangemen over
the last few years, and the fact
that the ‘Cuse is in the Top 25
doesn’t help the Panthers much
either. A loss seems to be
almost a sure thing, but this
game is different.

This will "be the last time a
handful of seniors take the field
at Pitt Stadium} To the fans this
game is just the next in a long
line of despair, but in reality it is
much, much more.

We are all aware of the down-
ward spiral the football program
has taken in terms of wins and
losses. We’ve sat through the .
tough losses and listened to the
jeers from around the country.

I remember the last day of

‘elementary school — that

mixed up feeling of fear and
anxiety. What does junior high
have to offer? Bells at the end of
class, bullies and girls you never
knew existed. I was confused,
but I knew I had a lot ahead of
me.

Junior high — the hormonal
imbalance we all knew, and

some even loved. We had “The .

Wonder Years”-esque dilem-
mas that we thought would
never go away. -

Does she “like me” like me?
“I thought your mom was pick-
ing us up.” And the unforget-
table breathing telephone
silence with equally unstable
girls.

I knew there had to be some-
thing to top those good times. It
came in the form of high school.
Gettin’ the coveted driver’s

Dorsett I

°From page 4
rookie year. I had given up on my rookie
year. Back then we played 14 games, and
that was the 10th game of the season. I
just happened to have a conversation with
Tom Landry and he said he expected me
to be a starter by now, and I stressed the
same thing, that I would be one too. I was
pretty much just banking on next year. My
attitude was care-free. I worked hard, but
if I dropped a pass in practice I didn’t go

crazy or hit the ground. I’d always say,‘

‘coach, I can do it on Sunday.’ That’s the
way I’ve always been.

But, if Landry didn’t feel comfortable
with you during the week, he wasn’t
going to put you in the game, especially a
rookie. He decided to start me coming
back here, and it was a great feeling
because as a lad growing up I loved the
Pittsburgh Steelers. To come back to your
home and be able to play against your
hometown team is an exciting feeling.

TPN: Did you feel like you had some- .

thing to prove?

TD: I didn’t feel I had anything to prove.
As an athlete, I just always felt I needed to
go out and get my job done and tl1at’s it.
How the chips may fall after it’s done

youdont  

with, so be it But tlrere’s no question, as a
motivating factor, coming back to play in
your hometown, psychologically, I was at
an all—time high.

TPN: What are you doing now?

TD: I’m in business. I own a sports bar
with a couple of my teammates, which we
do very good there. I own a bottled water
company that produces spring water. Earl
Campbell and I just started a business not
long ago that looks like it’s going to do

well. That’s in telecommunications, a pay '

phone business for inmates in jails and
prisons. I think L.C. Greenwood is
involved in that in this area.

My company is called Touchdown
Products. My water is called Tony
Dorsett’s Pro-Flow. That’s in Dallas.
We’re pretty much regional, in an eight-
state area. I’ve just experienced my ﬁrst
water season, and it went well. We’re
rockin’ and rolling right now.

TPN: How does your success in business
compare to your success in the NFL?

TD: It’s a different arena. As an athlete

you can get the quick fix. One carry you
may fumble, and the next you may go 99

the old Wagon with leftovers.
Come to Foster’s Bar & Grill, located

in the Holiday Inn Select 0 University

Center, 2-1/2 hours before each Pitt

home game. We have

yards. In the business world what I had to
learn was things take time. You have to be
able to produce, but things don’t happen
as fast. Fortunately, with the career I had,
people know who I am. The name recog-
nition and credibility I created as an ath-
lete has gotten me in a lot of doors, but
I’ve still got to produce. You have to nur-
ture at times. The gratification is there;
closing a big deal is like scoring the big
touchdown. I enjoy it. It’s challenging,
and sometimes that point of it keeps me

going.

TPN: What’s it like going places and see-
ing your picture on cups or Sports
Illustrated.

TD: It’s embanassing, man. I never really
have been comfortable with it. It makes
you feel good, but it’s different to see
yourself on TV. I’ve never been able to
feel extremely comfortable with it because
it’s kind of embarrassing.

TPN: How did you find out you were
going to be inducted into the Hall of
Fame?

TD: I got a call. Iknew I was one of the

nominees. I really didn’t know. I got hurt

in ‘89, I tore my knee up, my
ACL, and I was on injured
reserve that whole season, and I
retired right after that in ‘90. So
they said ‘89 was my first year
out of football, not ‘90. In ‘94 I
became eligible, and I didn’t
even know that.

When it came down to reality,
shit man, I was happy. I cried.
When you are recognized in that
manner it doesn’t get any better.
You’re legendary. People can go
to Canton, Ohio, and see Tony
Dorsett. You’re permanently
enshrined in the history of the
National Football League. As an
athlete, we’re all conditioned and
trained to be the best we can be,
and to be recognized that way
means you have been one of the
best players to compete in the

The Pitt News, Thursday, November 9, 1995

‘From page 3
EastToumament.

With eight appearances in the
championship game, Seton Hall
tries to make it nine as it enters
the tournament as the number
seven seed. Seton Hall holds the
highestwinning percentage
(.700) in tournament play.

Finally, just edging into the
tournament by one conference
win is number eight seed
Connecticut. The Huskies have

license and going on that first
date with your own wheels (or
mom and dad’s wheels that you,
called your own). i
The same girls you chased just
a few years before were now
being courted by the older, wiser
guys. You know, the guys who ,
would eventually come back to
your senior prom dressed in
their military garb. Those week-
end furloughs turned into lasting

room or parents to make you get
out of bed and go to school.
Freedom and responsibility at
the same time. It can be a world
of good if you play your cards
right, but if your don’t play a
good hand you’re back home_
doing chores.

. . When the end comes, many
are wondering, what’s next?
Will all that “hard” work pay
off? Where will I be?

That’s what many seniors will

their future, but most will not.
This will be the the last game
playing for the school that they
soon will call their alma mater.
These Panthers ‘havn’t given
the fans the big wins or trips to
bowls,.but think to yourself:
what have the fans given them?
So when Saturday rolls
around and you wake up to the
wind and rain, don’t roll over
and go back to sleep. Get out of
bed, get dressed and go to Pitt

Stadium. Win or lose, these men
deserve recognition for what
they’ve done at Pitt. When they
walk off the stadium turf for the
last time, they will lookup to the
stands, and I hope they see fans.
If they don’t, who is the loser
then?

Matt Grove is a columnist for
The Pitt News and is going to
the game, but will be in that
warm little press box.

good tight defense seems to be
the way to go when playing
Seton Hall. However, defense is
not all that’s needed.

“We have to be opportunis-
tic,” he said. “If we get the
chance to score, we have to put
it away.” .

Although tournaments in any
sport can cause stress and ten-
sion, they also create excite-
ment

“It’s' a great atmosphere. Eight
very good collegiate teams
playing soccer,” Luxbacher
said. “It shouldlbe an intense,
exciting weekend of soccer.”
