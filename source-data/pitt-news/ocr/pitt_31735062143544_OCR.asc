Cap And Gown
In Last Week
Of Rehearsals

To Give First Performance
Friday, April 21, at
Syria Mosque

Ticket Exchange Today

Seventy-ﬁve members of Cap and
Gown chorus, cast, and octette enter
their ﬁnal week of practice tomorrow
before the ﬁrst performance of ‘‘All

to the Point.” In addition to an en-
tire week of evening shows at the
Nixon, the all-male production will
play to a private house in the Syria
Mosque Friday, April 21.

Today is the second and last of the
ticket exchange opportunities for stu-
dents. Special rates have been pro-
vided for Pitt men and women, and
are available at the booths near the
Y Hut on DeSota street from 4:30 un-
til 6:30 o'clock this evening.

Men in the musical show will plunge
into their last week of activity, not
only for the rehearsal, but also for
ticket -selling. Two prizes of week-
end trips to New York City have been
offered to the men selling the greatest
number of admissions to the ﬁve
shows at the Nixon.

Costumes have been received dur-
ing the past two weeks from New
York, and are reported “authentic”
1789 fashions. Yet “All to the Point,”
says Director Marlatt, will be remem-
bered more for its music than for its
adherence to history.

Louis Fushan, a graduate Cap and
Gown member, and Stanley Goldman,
Col. '34, have written the lyrics for
the production. Composers represent-
ed are Harold Levenson, Col. '34,

‘Charles Textor, and Bernard Rosen-

son, Col, ’34. Additional numbers
were written by John St. Peter, Dr.
Benjamin Levant, and Gus A.

Schnabel. In all, there are twenty-
four musical pieces, many of which

eenth century Pittsburgh.

Article 5, Section 7 of the con-
stitution to be dropped, the fol-
lowing to be substituted:

“General campus elections shall
elect two women (one junior and
one senior) to represent the
women of the University. This
will eliminate the necessity of
electing one woman from the Col-

amendment will raise the number
of members from 12 to 14. The
women shall be nominated by
petitions signed by 25 women of
the University. Only students
elected from the school elections
shall be eligible for re-election
internally.

“The election to Council shall
be upon vote of all the women of
the University. These women
shall represent the women of the
University, not any school. This
shall not be interpreted to mean
that the powers and privileges of
these women shall be curtailed
in any way.”

hellenic Council, announces that she

Specht’s Columbia Broadcasting Com-
pany Orchestra. The band is nation-
ally known and also records for Co-
lumbia.

Panhellenic Ball is the one big fete
during the year that the association
of sorority women gives to the men.
It is the one affair for which the men
have to worry only about transporta-
tion and Corsages.

The scheme of decoration in the
ballroom will feature a departure
from the traditional. In previous
years replicas of the pins of each
group constituted the decorations
theme; on the night of the 21st, this
will give way to a more universal
type. It will consist of a large black
satin banner with the Panhellenic
emblem, a gold key, embossed on it.

Dance programs are secret, but it
is known that they will be a, combina-
tion program and favor.

Rose Marie Demesticha-s, president
of WSGA, announced that the execu-
tive committees of women’s campus
organizations elected tomorrow will
meet at the Heinz House on Thurs-
day, from 9:30 until 3 o'clock to
choose the chairmen of the organi-
zations’ committees for next year,

WSGA is sponsoring this work-day
in an effort to make for greater ef-
ﬁciency in choosing committee chair-
men. Senior court will be at the
Heinz House ready to check the names
submitted for eligibility and duplica-
tions as they are sent in.

This will be the ﬁrst time that such
a plan has been followed on the cam-
pus, and it will be the ﬁrst meeting
of the executive officers who will
be elected tomorrow. All women who

ing the past year are urged to come

Will Elect
14 Members
On April 28

College, Education Rulings
Dropped; WSGA is
Denied Control

Petitions Now Available

Women of the University will have
special representation in Student
Council after Friday, April 28, the date
set for general Spring elections.

This drastic change in the nature
of the legislative body was approved
Friday when the constitutional amend-
ment introduced and given ﬁrst read-
ing last Wednesday by Arthur Gold-
berg, C01., was passed by a two-thirds
vote of the entire membership. The
amendment automatically increases
the membership of Student Council
from 12 to 14,

The “Goldberg Amendment” given
ﬁnal sanction at Friday's special
session drops article 5 of Council's
constitution, which p1‘0Vides that at
least one of the two representatives
from the College and the School of
Education shall be a woman, and sub-
stitutes a provision for the election
of two women (one junior and one
senior) to represent the “women of
the University,” not any school.

Under the new provision, the “ne-
cessity" of electing one woman from
each of these two schools is eliminat-
ed, yet it will be possible for either
men or women to elect representatives
to ﬁll both positions in each school.

The objection to the old system of
representation, as offered by Goldberg,
was that it was “unfair and undemo-
cratic” in that it “permitted the elec-
tion of two women while the men of
the schools could elect but one.”
Goldberg based his objection on the
fact that women constitute but one-
ﬁfth the enrollment in the College,
where they are guaranted one-half the
representation,

Any woman student of the Univer-
sity may nominate herself for election
to one of the two special Council
posts by ﬁling a signed petition with
the office of the dean of men. Peti-
tions may be obtained beginning to-
day from that ofﬁce, and the peti-
tionee, upon returning the paper
signed by 25 women of the University,
has automaticallynominated herself

Cap and Gown Club

 

There will be a meeting of the

The Campus-Socially

With “All to the Point” well on the
way to a successful premiere, the
Undergraduate Cap and Gown will
cease foot and mouth practice long
enough to entertain the Graduate
Cap and Gown at an informal dance
tomorrow evening. From 9 to 12
o'clock the popular melodies of the
Lewis Pipers Orchestra will be heard
at the Heinz House. Robert Young,
Eng. '33, chairman, has promised en-
tertainment by Eugene Kelley and
William Pillich, Cap and Gown stars.

But by the time the dance is in full
swing sororities and fraternities will
have been forsaken by their sorors
and fraters for presumingly more en-
tertaining quarters. Dances, formal
and informal, will greet the college
set on return to their respective
homes for the Easter vacation. To
those who are not going, but who
have been at home the entire year,
Easter proves the most opportune
time to resume acquaintance with
their own neighborhood and city en-
tertainment.

At It Again

THERE will be plenty of talk in the next few days on the passage

of the “Goldberg Amendment,” the measure which provides spe-
cial representation in Student Council for women of the University.
There will be plenty of talk—both for and against the amendment—
and not all of it will come from Heinz House.

Among the “women of the University” there will be a feeling
that Student Council, at last, has begun to appreciate their import-
ance as individuals, their ability to legislate for a mixed student
body with as much success as men.

Among the executives and subordinate ofﬁcers of WSGA there
will probably be a feeling that is divided between exultation and
chagrin. . They will be pleased because they have been given an op-
portunity to enlarge their jurisdiction and gain greater recognition
for women—a fulﬁllment of what appears to be their purpose—for
it will be possible under the new elective system to ﬁll six of the
fourteen Council posts with members of their sex. They will be
somewhat chagrined because Student Council denied them the right
to nominate these special representatives in a so-called “undemo-
cratic” manner. Their feeling, in short, will be one of compromised
satisfaction.

Among the vast majority of indifferent, uninterested undergrad-
uates—the large group of men and women who are mentally unbut-
toned on the subject of student politics, and proud of it—-there will
be a brief query and a knowing laugh, but hardly anything that
could be called feeling. They will say, “What difference does it
make?” convincingly enough to win another handful of converts.

But all other sentiment notwithstanding, the political science
majors and the students who believe in consistency in government
are going to be sore. They are going to examine the move in the
light of its effects on the entire student body. It is inevitable that
they will look for possible motives that have little to do with democ-
racy. And it is equally inevitable that they will add another black
mark to the store of mental reservations they keep on hand each
year for Student Council.

These politically consciencious individuals are going to resent
the dragging in of “democracy” as a test of student government at
the University. They are going to ﬁnd reason to talk about the inan-
ner in which the word has been bandied about by student legislators.
They are going to say, “If democracy is to be the test for one small
part of your machinery, make it the test for your entire system.”
But that would be bad. It would most certainly be frowned upon by
the ‘ ‘interest ’ ’ groups.

There is no reason to clamor for proportional representation be-
tween men and women in the College and School of Education when
that feature of democracy does not exist for the schools themselves.
And there is no reason why there should be continued separation of
student interests into those of men and those of women. When
every eﬁort is being made to make ‘.‘co-education” mean what it
implies, to get away from the idea that there is some kind of a con-
test on between the men and women for supremacy in the University,
this amendment can only widen the breach between the two groups
by antagonizing one of them in a political move.

Under a supposedly representative system, it is impossible to
ﬁnd any just reason why the women, any more than any other group,
should be given special representation in Council. That goes almost
without saying. Council has sacriﬁced some of its own prestige in
dancing to another ’s tune.

But even granting the women this “privilege,” it is probable
that they will ﬁnd the College and Education cupboards bare when
the tabulation of Council votes is made. For unless they resort to
the same “gang” methods of political promotion that we have seen
in the past three years, they cannot hope to beat out the organized
male groups in these schools. The amendment works its injustice in
both directions.

The compulsory election of at least one woman from the College
and the School of Education has had one good eﬁect that more than
balanced its alleged undemocratic tendencies. It has acted as an
effective “brake” on the political aspirations of deﬁnitely organized
interests in these schools.

— Now that the “brake” has been removed, we may expect con5di-
tions that are far more unfair than those which have just been oﬂi-
cially condemned and corrected.

IF YOU are the sort of person who looks in the back pages of the
newspaper for the accounts of more important events, you will
read during the coming week of the trial of the Scottsboro boys.
For certainly, the International Labor Defense has not been getting

the front page break for the “boys” that it would like.
I think it is no lie that the individuals contributing their money

to the defense of the accused negroes have been unlucky. That is in
regard to publicity. And publicity is% ’
exactly what they want. They are

anxious to throw light on the Ala-
ba.-mo. varietycof justice. "From the re-
ports of Alabama justice that have
ﬁltered north through liberal periodi-
cals ever since the Reconstruction fol-
lowing the Civil War, a little light on
the blindfolded lady might not be
amiss.
Gruff Justice

It took no Scottsboro case to prove
that there were two kinds of justice
in Alabama—and other southern
states too, for that matter. The trial
of these boys has been the effective
instrument of calling attention to a
condition well enough known, but ap-
parentlylh little cared about. This
case, because it‘ is not'confused with
issues of radical opinion, except as the
International Labor Defense applies
them. is an outstanding example of
how the negro is treated in the south.

To anyone who is more an impartial
spectator the problem is not what is
done in the south, but rather what
could be done to correct, or ameli-
orate, present conditions, The radical
suggestion is that all color line be
wiped out immediately and complete-
ly. Such a. suggestion assumes other

changes; in fact it assumes wide so-
cial changes that would turn indus-
trial life upside down, and put the
world to work on a new basis. I do
not expect to see the world go to work
on a new basis next week or next
year, either, however much I may be-
lieve that it might not be a bad idea.
And so for the present, facing a social
structure that has been functioning
on a peculiar basis of its own for
some decades, the solution of the
negro problem is no snap to be made
in a single statement and a single act.
Same Old Stuff

That the negro problem can be
solved without changing the social
conditions that produced it is a real
question. On a rough, detached guess
I would say no. But social changes,
especially those so fundamental as
the ones that are apparently needed.
in the south, are a. long time coming.
And the needs of a race that hasn’t
had an even break in a long time are
immediate.

If I were the dictator to say what
should be done, Iwould pick slow work
as a_ (fundamental proposition. For
the present mess is a sweet example

of what happens when human beings
act speedily.

Slavery must have been a terrible
‘institution. But it could not have
been much _worse than the slavery
that exists now for the negro. And I
think that the southern negro can
thank his northern white brothers for
about three—quarters of his present
troubles. I am not so gullible as to
believe that the southerner of the
nineteenth century, if let alone, would
have worked out a perfect solution of
the problem of the negro. But I be-
lieve that he could have done a bet-
ter job of it than the hordes in uni-
forms who overran the south in the
sixties.

Pre-War Opinion

Southern literature previous to the
Civil War shows a. real concern for
the colored man. People down there
were thinking about what should be
done, They did not always think with
the greatest impartiality. But they
thought. And that is more than the
readers of the yellow abolitionist
press were doing. Southern intellec-
tuals recognized the problem. South-
ern workers felt the economic eﬁects
of forced labor which competed with
them for a living. A change was
coming. Some students estimate that
slavery, had the south been let alone,
would have been abolished volun-
tarily before the turn of the century.

Voluntary abolition by southerners
would not have produced any Utopia
for the negro. But being voluntary, it
would not have begot an irradicable
hatred for the freed men which was
exactly what interference by northern-
ers brought.

Before the busy-bodies from the
north stuck their noses in, there was
no such thing as the modern prejudice
against the negro. There was a. pat-
on-the-head attitude which colored
persons today resent—and with justice.
But if a man is going to feel that I am
of an inferior race, I would much
rather have him accept me as decent
though somewhat stupid fellow rather
than hate me as 3. demon only to be
killed off so long as complete sub-
servience is not shown. The kind
master is more of an approach 120
equality than the blind hater.

War Results

The results of the Civil War have
been a situation which I believe, will
not be remedied in many generations.
If nothing else, it is a demonstration
of the ineffectiveness of war or any
other kind of unwelcome physical
force as an instrument of social re-
form. Bungling has made the Scotts-
boro case and a thousand other cases
like it.

We would like to do something for
the negro, But our idealistic ances-
tors have presented us with a tough
nut that cannot be cracked without
cracking everything else in sight.

The annual banquet of the senior
class of the Law School took place
last week in the Chamber of Com-
merce Building Salon.

of the law school, spoke about the
class as 9. whole. Peter J. Surma,
president of the senior class, talked
about highlights in the class history,
from its beginning three years ago.
Thomas F. Lansberry talked humor-
ously about strange events concerning
the senior class,

Musical talent in the senior class
provided the musical entertainment.
Bernard J. Miller rendered vocal se-
lections; Francis S. McQuilkin pre-
sented several classical selections on
the piano; and Herbert Lomask en-
tertained with violin solos.

The members of the entertainment
committee were: John V. Snee, chair-
man; Abe R. Moretsky, Jason Rich-
ardson, William J. McDowell, Jr., and
George H. McKean.

Louis Artuso, Law '33, former ac-
tivities leader at,Grove City college,

the regular monthly meeting of the
Biology Forum of the School of
Pharmacy, yesterday morning. Dr.
Williams’ topic was “Wanderings of
a Naturalist in Djuka. Land.”

Dr. Williams has made a number
of trips to this region, located in the
tropical rain forests between the
Amazon and Orinoco rivers and has
lived among the aborigines from
Bolivia to Brazil. His dissertation
centered about the giant snakes,
jaguars, anteaters, tapirs and other
animal forms, the jungles, the ﬂowers,
and the people in a hot and humid
jungle.

Foamy Panther Features
Professor’s Drinking
Ballad Tomorrow

 

Bowing to the times, and taking
oﬂicial recognition of the return of
beer, the Pitt Panther will issue to-
morrow a rollicking “Beer Number.”
Staff members of the magazine have
thoroughly investigated the case for
beer, and have discovered many
aspects of the subject that lend them-
selves to humor. The humor, to say
the least, is not at all dry.

Featuring the issue is a rhythmic

beer ballad written for the Panther by
a Pitt professor, whose name has not
yet been disclosed. The ballad is
titled, “Hail and Farewell, or A New
Deal.”

For perhaps the ﬁrst time in
Panther history, the cover has been
drawn by a coed. Its theme, distinct-
ly on the subject of beer, it was, un-
fortunately on the press when the
University took its stand on beer.

One of the most frequent questions
heard on the campus is, “Will the
athletes be allowed to drink beer?”
Hy Cohen, sports writer for the
Panther, asked the opinions of sev-
eral of the athletic coaches, and re-
veals some startling facts in his arti-
cle, “Spring, Sports, and Beer.”

“Cut-Outs for Junior,” “Bartender’s
Catalogue,” “A Proof-Reader's Night-
mare,” and “Soup to Nazi,” a few of
the humorous features, are predicted
to be four of the most successful
Panther burlesques of the year.

“Freshman About Town,” continu-
ing with its gossipy revelations, the
new modes in hats and shoes by
Elinor Smith, fashion writer, and an
article, “Students Without Money,”
disclosing the ﬁnancial plight of many
college students, complete the issue.

Cieven Discusses Penn

men‘s Clubs on “William Penn and
