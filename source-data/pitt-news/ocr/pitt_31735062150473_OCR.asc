As guest artist, the Choral has

his famous character impersonations.
Mr. Hammond has chosen two char-
acterizations which he will give in
costume: “He Knew Lincoln,” by Ida
Tarbell, and “The Interview,” by
Mark Twain.

Two soloists who have appeared be-
fore many campus groups will also
appear on the program. Marion Wer-

ter’s “Serenade” and Gounod’s“‘Je
Vous Vivre,” from Romeo and Juliet.
The accompanist of the Wome-n’s
Choral, Mrs. Lucille Hamilton Wer-
ner, will sing.

Mildred Gardner, C40, will play a
violin obligate 'to “Dance to the Ball-
erina” from “Petroushka” by Stra-
vinsky; and Miriam Todd, Ed37, will
play a ﬂute obligato to the “Nightin-
gale Song” by Handel.

Between group songs the Choral
Quartet, composed of Annabelle
linupp, Ed-37, ﬁrst soprano, Helen
Kulik, Ed4U, second soprano, Helen
lieiper, Ed37, alto, and Mary Ruth
Goodwin, C39, alto, will be featured.

Under ‘the direction of Mrs. Ger-
trude Northup Ayars, the Choral will
sing a varied program. It will include
the following:

“The Cathedral” by Alan Floyd;
“Ave Maria” by J. Arcadelt, arranged
by Louis Saar; “Adoramus te,

Band Schedules
Home Concert

For Wednesday

 

As one of the principal features of
Spring Festival Week, the University
ROTC Band will be set to swing into
its annual home concert Wednesday
evening at Carnegie Music Hall. Lee
M. Lockhart, director of instrumental
music will conduct the band in one
of its characteristic programs of class-
ical and novelty numbers.

Most of the numbers to be per-
formed are standard classics that have
been transcribed for concert band. In
this class falls one of J. S. Bach’s
greatest choral and fugues, a Bee'th~
oven, “Larghetto,” and two of De-
bussy’s most famous compositions:

the song, “Girl With the Flaxen
Hair,” and the, “Golliwogs’ Cake
Walk,” from the Children’s Piano

Suite. A modern number in the band’s
playing repertoire, “Headlines,” a re-
cent American work, made such a hit
at the Scholar’s Day assembly that it
was decided to include it in the home
concert.

Tickets are still available for the
student body upon presentation of
the student activities book. They may
be secured in the office of the military
department, 11th ﬂoor, Cathedral.

Poetry Contest
Tryouts Set
For Thursday

You don't have to be a Katharine
Ilepburn or a Leslie Howard to take
part in the poetry reading contest
which is being sponsored by Delta
Sigma Rho, national honorary foren-
sic fraternity.

All you have to do is prepare a

will be held, and members of the
speech department will select the six
contestants who will take part in the
ﬁnals.

According to Miss Theresa Kahn,
instructor in English, selections from
any of the classic poets or from any
contemporary poet of merit are ap-
propriate. Excellence of selection and
interpretation will be considered.

The ﬁnal contest will take place the
following Thursday and will be judged
by ﬁve professors from the English
department. The winner will be pre-
sented a copy of the Book of Oxford
English Verse given by Percival Hunt,
professor and head of the depart-
ment of English.

Last Chance

 

Tickets for the Cap and Gown
production, “Trailer Ho!” will go
on sale again this Thursday and

Performances
Scheduled For Three
Pennsylvania Cities

Making their first out-of-town trip
since 1930, Cap and G-owners leave
this morning for a three-day tour to
Johnstown, Bradford and Erie.

Two buses, one with the prop(_‘1"ties
and production staffs, will leave at
7:30 o’clock; the other, with the cast
and choruses, will pull out at 11:40
o’clock.

When the buses arrive in Johns-
town, the students will register at the
Fort Stanwix Hotel, lunch at a nearby
church and proceed immediately to
Johnstown Central high school audi-
torium, where a rehearsal will be held.
After dinner, they will return to the
auditorium for makeup and the per-
formance.

The Johnstown performance is to
be under the sponsorship of the Lee
Hospital Junior Auxiliary.

From Johnstown the show moves on
Tuesday to Bradford, Pa., where a
performance sponsored by the Me-
Kean County Pitt Club will be given
at the New Bradford Theatre. The
choristers will rest overnight at the
Hotel Holly in Bradford.

The final production of the trip is
scheduled in the auditorium of Acad-
emy high school in Erie. This show,
which the Erie Kiwanis Club is spon-
soring, will be given Wednesday eve-
ning. Immediately after this show, the
buses will leave for home, arriving at
the Cathedral at 3:15 o’clock Thurs-
day morning. '

Eight Fraternities

Outstanding senior and junior stu-
dents will be honored, and eight
honorary fraternities will tap new
members at ceremonies to be held in
front of Memorial Hall on Friday
morning at 11 o’clock.

Speaker at the tapping ceremony
will be Dr. John J. Geise, assistant
professor of history. Interest centers
about the selection of Senior Queen

standing man in the graduating class.

Those fraternities tapping are:

And if you were as smart as two

the Spring Festival Dance. These lads
called themselves “Independent-lnde

you had a ﬁcld—day last Friday. And
then you found that the voting-

the banana oil spilled around campus
to grease the machines.)

But now it’s over. No more slates.
No more back-slapping. No more

And now, where’s the Sloan’s lini-

In addition, plaques will be pre-

February. In case of rain, the cere-
monies will be held in Memorial Hall,
according to William Stark, chair-
man of Tap Day.

oalition Wins, 16-12,
In SFA, Sweeps CA Offices,

Dominates Men’s Council

IN DEPENDEN TS THREATEN

By Stub Harrison
An all-time record number of voters pushed and clicked their
respective ways through a complicated election procedure of elec-
tion cards and voting machines to give the fraternity coalition an
edge in the Student-Faculty Assembly, a clean sweep in College
Association, and a “Strangler Lewis” hold on Men’s Council Friday.

When the tally sheets were
ripped from the back of the sev-
en County-loaned voting ma-
chines, they showcd a total of
1723 voters, exactly 109 better
than the former all-time high, es-
tablished two years ago in tlic
1935 returns.

One year ago, 1490 students
turned out to put the Beta-Indc-
pendent group in teinporary
power by a xnargain of 17-13.
.l‘wo years ago, four factions
clectioneered to set up the
former high of 1592; and, to com-
pare even further, there were 1141
voters in 1934, and 1228 in 1933,
the year that marked the over-
throw of the G.O..lv’.’s (the grand
old party, later Alphas, and now
the backbone of the fraternity
coalition.)

Al Kairys, BA, led the pack in
individual vote-getting by taking
the ﬁrst junior seat with an all-
time record individual high of
366, surpassing Bill McQuade’s
record of 270 in 1935. Kairys tal-
lied 101 more votes than his near-
est junior competitor.

It took a minimum of 188 votes
in the senior men's division to
win a place in the Assembly, as

Spring Festival
Clrc us Set

For Wednesday

The world awakens with the Spring
We’ve aroused the monkeys ’n every-
thing.

-Wednesday afternoon’s Cir c u 5

Swing is expected to set the pace‘

for the Spring Festival program, ac-
cording to Madeleine Batty, Ed37,
chairman.

First event on the annual program,
the Circus Swing will be a mixture
of rusticity, urbanity, and monkeys.
The one ring show will take place
in Webster Hall's ballroom with
Ches Walters and his boys oiﬁciatiiig,
beginning at 3 o’clock,

Miss Batty promises clowns, mon-
keys, and trapczes, together with
pink lemonade.

Chaper-ons for the danc-e are Mr.
and Mrs. Carl F. Distelhor::.t, and
Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Batcheldcr.

Entrance to the big show—-includ-
ing clowns, monkeys, trapeze;-;, and
pink lemonade—-will cost 25 ‘cents
per person. Gong will be rung at 6
o’clock.

Organism

Cathedral Speaker System
To Dispatch Music

This afternoon, from 12:30-12:40
o’clock, an organ recital will be
trans-mitted over the loud speaker
system of the Cathedral.

These short concerts will be heard
twice weekly, on Mondays and Fri-
days, with student soloists at the
console of the Hammond electric
organ, installed this year in the 23rd
ﬂoor of the building.

Soloist today will be Harry Golby,
C39. Golby, a student of Frank Ken-
nedy at Pittsburgh Musical Institute,
will play two numbers J. S. Bach’s
“A1'ioso,” and Sir Edward Elgar’s,
“Salut D’ Amour.” Besides his cham-
ber music work at the University,
Golby is president of the French
Club, being the only student ever to
secure the position in his sophomore
year.

The present cycle of recitals were
instigated from the suggestion of
Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of
the University, and were planned by
a committee from the Freshman
Women’s Council, including Mildred
Cardener, chairman, Evelyn Lowy,
and Betty Schrom.

The Bach number is from one of
the German master’s organ cantatas,
which he wrote, one every week, for
his congregation. It is heard quite
frequently on the radio programs of
the day because of the present in-
tense interest in Bach’s music.

Recognition

T IS GRATIFYING TO

LEARN that an unrecognized
campus group, namely, the Pitt
Student Union, has been granted
permission to hold meetings in
a University building. While we
hold no particular brief for the
principles or causes of that or-
ganization, it should nevertheless
be pointed out that students
should not be denied their con-
stitutional right to assemble
peaceably. b h’ f h

The -rou , a ranc ~ 0 t e
Americai Stlhdent Union, holds
its first organizations meeting
today at 12:30 o'clock in Alum-
ni Hall. There it will prepare a
constitution and draw up plans
for its formal application to
pietitiog recogrnition. If the groug
o stu ents ave purpose an
initiative worthy of considera-
tion, they should be recognized
and be permitted to function
much like any other undergrad-
uate University activity. If their
measures are worthwile, and they
have the correct approach, it is
likely that the Union will sur-
vive and do good.

For the--past two years, the
group has been denied the right
to hold a, meeting in a Univer-
sity building for the reason that
it has been “unrecognized” by
the student government. a

The step that led to the grant
of permission to assemble is
progressive, an-d Yhighly signif-
icant. It is. signiﬁcant not so
much for the one particular
group vitally concerned, but
more so for its affect on future
campus groups hinging on meas-
ures of a highly-controversial
nature. There is a need for dis-
cussion groups to educate stu-
dents and faculty alike on polit-
ical, social, and economicissues
that so often are brushed aside,
ineonveniently from an educa-
tional and progressive point of
view. -‘ - 5 "

We commend the Pitt Student
Union for its persistency, Pro-
fessors DeVites and Schoenberg-
er for their faculty sponsorship,
and the authorities for treating
the situation with intelligence

 

ews J

and fairness.—E.H.B.

Illdependeilts Show Strength,
But Are Edged Out By Greeks

(Continued from Page 1)
compared to last year’s junior
low of 129 votes. The minimum
was even higher in some divi-
sions, with 202 in the senior
women’s group topping the list.

Possibly the biggest surprise
was Nick Spanos, who stood sec-'
ond high in the balloting-for
senior men, with 319 votes. Bill
Stark, who also paced "his" class
in last year’s election, came’ out
on top once more with a total
of 344. . "

John Michelosen, ’38, unsup-
ported, made a strong bid to
break both party tickets, but
wound up in second place behind
Ted Whitaker in the race for the
presidency of College Associa-
tion. The fraternity coalition
pullcd in 323 votes for Whitaker,
while Michclosen accounted for
258, followed by ' Independent-
backed Verna Douglas, ’38, lone
woman in the race, with 231.

The daywas-ideal, in direct
contrast to the damp chilly after-
noon that discouraged 1936 vot-
ing. It is believed, according to
reports of members of the elec-
tion board, that several hundred
voters decided against casting a
ballot, because they failed to ﬁll
out election cards at mid-semes-
ter registration or because some
cards-‘were -lost or misplaced in
the shuffle. -

Verna Douglas was tops in the

senior women group, polling 273
votes, ahead of Lucy Conn, last
year’s junior leader, with 255.
Ruth Custer, C39, running on the
same ticket as Miss Douglas, was
top-heavy favorite in the junior
class with 261 votes.
‘ Lea'Cvol_dstein, C39, won the
ﬁfth and final junior woman seat
with a surprising total of 197‘
votes. Miss Goldstein was not
backed by either political group,
and stands with Spanos as the
only two who were successful in
breaking the party slates.

Balance of power in next year’s

SFA Assembly now rests with
the fraternity coalition, organi-
zation of the 13 men’s social fra-
ternities and four women’s social
fraternities. The fraternity group
placed candidates in 16 of the 30
seats, while‘ Boss MeQuade’s In-
dependent crew seorcd 12 times,
leaving the position of the two
remaining Asscmblymcn - elect
undecided. '

Those members of the present
Assembly who were successful
in their campaigns for reelection
include: Rose Nugent, Lucy
Conn, and Mary Jane Beachler,
junior women; William Stark,
D. C. Schultz, Bill McKenna,
and Ernie Rose, junior men; and
Al Barr, senior man.

Casualties were: Ray Nord-
strom, Frank Engel, Leo Koch-
erlein, Herb Rackoff, and John
Wren, junior men.

Rackoff topped all candidates
in Men’s Councilwith a total
high of 291, just 208 votes better
than his nearest competitor, An-
thony De Leo. Fraternity men
now possess 12 out of a possible
13 seats in the Council, a group
which is constitutionally. self-
perpetuating, in part.

It was a gay and colorful scene
on the Bigelow side of Memorial
Hall, with slates, campaign prom-
ises, chewing gum, cigars, elec-
tion-best dress, wide smiles, the
customary wave of hearty hand-
shakes, good-natured slaps on the
back, the slam of car doors that
brought taxi-loads of escorted
voters down to the polls, and con-
juring campaign managers all
casting a magic spell of cxeit
merit and concentrated activity.

Election of next year’s SFA
executive committee will be held
during the first two weeks in
May. It is probable that the first
meeting of the newly-elected
members of Men’s Council will
be held before that time to deter-
mine officers for the 1936-37

group.

Small town girl makes gocd . . . at
least, not even the most rabid fan
would say that the town of Glassport
was a metropolis or that Kay Hardy
who hails from there had not made
good in the big city.

Kay started out as freshman by
being elected vice p1‘es:ident of her
class. At the end of that ﬁrst year
she was tapped to membership of
Cwens. And two years later to two
1nore honorary fraternities—Mortar
Board and Xylon.

She began watching the welfare of
new students as a. sophomore when
she served as a member of ‘the W5 -A
customs committee, continued in her
junior year as chairman of the Trans-
fer Council. She completed ‘this task
this year by serving as senior mentor
for two semesters and as a justice in
Senior Court.

Rounding out an active junior year
Kay was elected president of her
class, treasurer of her fraternity,
Zeta Tau Alpha, and was an associate
editor of the Owl.

President of her fraternity in her
senior year Kay has climaxed her
career by being chosen the ﬁrst coed
co-chairman of Spring Festival Week
in history, and as a candidate for
Senior Queen.

ties to that ﬁeld.

Having been chairman of the Sports
Unit and a member of the cabinet
of the freshman class, Mary Lou was
tapped to Cwens at the end of her

freshman year. - -

Continuing her activities during her
sophomore year she was elected as a
representative to ‘WSGA and there

she spent the ﬁrst part of her senior
year as a mentor.

In her spare time Mary Lou travels

Liberty, Freedom
=--Dr. Root

Attainme-nt of liberty and freedom
lies in the keen evaluation of impend-
ing social evolution and not in appeal
to the authority of historical person-
alities.

That is an observation of Dr. Wil-
liam T. Roo't, dean of the Graduate
School and head of the department
of psychology, as he addressed stu-
dents at the first meeting of the new
SFA—sponsored Student-Faculty For-
um Friday noon. Dr. Root discussed
“Psychological Aspects of Social Or-
ganization.”

Although giving a brief historical
survey to show how the principles of
liberty have been misconstrued, he
declared that “the tendency is now
to broaden freedom and liberty to in-
clude every man, woman, and child.”

“Social planning,” he said, “re-
quires a long-time view. But man is
primarily a creature of the immediate
present. Any consideration of free-
dom and liberty must give considera-
tion 'to the fact that man is roused
to fury and action only by the immi-
nent.”

He mentioned a second aspect, that
of encroaclnnent on personal rights
by social legislation, emphasizing that
personal and social problems play a
large part in wha't persons conceive as
encroachments on their rights.

Another difficulty, he declared, is
the attempt of every “ism” and
creed to associate the principle of lib-
crty only with its own type of govern-
mcnt or theories, and apply the op-
posite point of view to conflicting at-
titudcs.

“The dangerous feature about this,”
he explained, “is -‘the extreme egotism
of groups with the highest ethical
intent.”

Distinction should be made, he con-
tinued, between practical and imprac-
tical social planning.

“There is a vast horde of half-
baked idealists trying ‘to get the im-
possible,” he observed.

“The desire for personal freedom,”
he said, “is another factor that has
deﬁed social planning so far.” He il-
lustrated this by pointing out the lack
of observance of liquor, gambling,
and similar laws.

“The arch-enemy of freedom and
social planning is propaganda,” Dr.
Root added. “Propaganda deprives a
man of his freedom and makes him
like it.”

He also deplored the principle of
freedom as applied ‘to private interest
as against the public good, advocated
relaxing of movie censorship, advis-
ing that there is “safety in publicity.”

“We must plan and restrict for

 

_ socially inadequate groups,” he said.

“Eventually we must plan or perish.”

fessor of psychology, will discuss the

World This Is!
I.
It was at the Rota.rian’s Conven-
tion. Alexander Doakes, Pot-tsville,

South Dakota, approached Ruther-
ford Glyth, Ruxton, Oregon. They
gave the Rotarian handclasp accord-
ing to ritual, although they had
never seen one another before.

“So you’rc from Ruxton,” Doakcs
began. “Do you know a hab-erdasher
in Ruxton by name of Kirstenheim-
er? J. John Kirstenheimer‘.7”

“I’m afraid I don’t,” Glyth re-
sponded. “But, say, do you happen
to be acquainted with a Margaret
Campbell in I’ot.t.sville? I met ‘her
ten years ago.”

“Nope, never heard of her.”

The exotic young woman looked
like a movie star, sitting on the plush
sofa in the Statler.

A gentleman, handsome, bronzed,
got up from his chair across the
lobby, wa.1ked over to her, removed
his hat, smiled, said:

“It certainly is a pleasure to meet
you, Miss Del Rio. I want to tell you
how much I enjoyed your last pic-
turc.”

“Tee, hec,” she answered. “My
name isn't Del Rio. Just plain Mary
Dugan.”

He woke up with a start. Finally
he had a hot tip on today’s races.

He knew how to interpret his
dream. He had dreamed that he fell
into an ocean of hot coffee and when
he hit bottom, he saw a crazy man
baking a cake. He ﬁgured:

“You make a cake with dough. A
lunatic is a nut. Join the two and
you have doughnut. The coffee? You
dunk doughnuts in coffee. Perfectly
obvious.”

He placed $2,000. on Doughnut
Dunkci-‘s nose in the third race.

Monopoly won the third race.

She met him in the park. She was
lovely, the very breath of loveliness.
But he looked like a bum.

Yet he had strong, Grecian fea-
tures. They talked to each other for
several hours, sitting on the park
bench. He had perfect manners,
spoke exquisite English. secured to be
a gentleman on vacation.

She was unable to learn anything
about his past, knew little of his
present, could only guess at his
future.

“Please, please tell me who you
are,” she begged.

“Why I’m just an ordinary bum.

At Philadelphia Meet

" Indiana University Squad,

Led By Don Lash, Tommy

Deckard, Take Team Honors; Panther Sprint

 

Medley T cam Sets Record

. l _ . .. 1 _ _ By Bill Morse
‘Philadelphia, April 24.—-—Whil‘e a quartet or great runners from
Indiana University was stealing the show at the Penn Relays held
at Fran_klin Field, Philadelphia, Friday and Saturday, two Pan-
ther relay teams managed to cop‘ an even eight of those much-

desired trophy watches.

-It was Don Lash and his fellow Hoosiers who thrilled a great

crowd of more than 40,000 with their
astounding speed and staniinalas they
combined to set a new world record
in the four-mile relay.

Paced by Smith and Lash, the In-
diana’ team ran four miles in 17:16.6
to. break the record held by the so-
called “dream team” of Cunningham,
Venzke, Hornbostel and San Romani
setvlast summer in England.

Second honors should go to the
Panther sprint medley relay teanisof
Art T-homﬂas, D»ick'Mason, Glenn Coop-

home 35 ‘yards out _in'ffro_nt..

The other four watches went to
the Pitt freshman 'niil'e_re"lay’ quartet
of Lewis, Ferrara, McKee, and Ohl.
Lewis started fast, and-his teammates
tore. up the softtrack to ‘defeat Man-
h‘att'a.n‘, defending "champions", ‘in the
time of ‘3:24‘.S. _ ' ' '

Only Pantl:I'e-‘r defending a cl1'a'in'P-
ionship, Gene Taa-no, javelin titlist,
was unable to qualify at the minimum
of 190 feet. He has been troubled by
a strained back muscle since the in-
door season. Sanborn of Army added
17 feet to Ta.ano’s~ winning throw of
last year with a toss of 213 feet, 11
inches.

A fast Pitt sprint relay squad lost
an excellent opportunity for anotlier
victory when Ed Routch and 
Spitz tangled in passing the baton,
and the. half-mile team, anchored
again by Woodruff running one of
his rare 220-yard races, con-1dn’t.quite
make the grade. A team from North
Texas State Teacher’s College won
this event, but was disqualiﬁed for
passing the baton illegally. A A

These same Texas boys, sporting
a pair of fast twins in Elmer and
Delmer Brown, stole the show from
the Panthers again Saturday after-
noon by nosing them out in ‘the Class
B mile relay, even though Wo’odru-ff',_
running anchor, cut down a huge lead
to a bare three yards by irunn-ing a
48 second quarter mile.

Thomas Starts Poorly I.

Art Thomas, running the first leg,
was off to a bad start but »race'd
around the outside of the track to

obtain a slight lead which Red. Test.

and Alex Legigin could not hold.
Woodruff s'ta1'te'd the last lap about
25 yards behind Brown. The Texan

broke the ‘tape’ for a new Class B ;

record in 3 :19.6.

Mason and Cooper, sprinters, were ‘

unable to qualify for the 100-yard
feature event. Leading a fast fu‘-:l’_c_l,
Eulace Peacock, Temple ﬂash, defeat-
ed Ben Johnson of Columbia and Bob
Packard of Georgia in 9.8 seconds
after he had leapedyto first place in
the broad jump, sliortlyjbeforc. '

Cornell University won the colorful
shuttle relay, an event which the O1-
sonmen did not enter, by nosing out
a great Penn State team. The ath-
letes from State. College showed a
great deal of power and w1ill‘undoubt-
edly test Pitt to the limit in their
coming meet. _

Indiana University took team hon-
ors with two ‘new carnival nia-rks and
a_ world record in the relays, and two
individual winners, Lash in the In-
vitation Mile, and Tommy Deckard
in the 300 meter steeplechase.

Outsprints Beccali

Final and perhaps most. colorful
event of the day was this Invitation
Mile which Lash won only after an

amazing sprint in. which he nosed out '

Luigi Beccali of"Italy -in the home
stretch. Venzke and Federoffi were
lost in the final. rush for the tape.

In an interview following the race,
both Lash and. Beccali expressed their
admiration for Pitt’s Woodruff whom
Lash agreed is “the fastest half-miler
in the world . . . and I saw them all.”

Lash, who last year set a new world
record for the two-mile run by low-

ering Paavo Nurm'i’s ‘old record, was-

greatly ela'ted at the showing of the
Hoosier four-mile relay team. He es-
pecially praised Jimmy Smith, whose
4:14 mile made the new record pos-
sible.

Bill McMunn, former Pitt track
star, ran anchor man for Catholic
University's mile relay team, starting

and finishing in fourth place.

By 9-0 Score

.Pa_nthers To Second
Shutout Victory

 

 

_ Each match that the Pitt golf team
plays seems to add another bit_ of
ci1~cums‘ta'ntia1- evidence to the con-
clusion ‘that it is the 'dist'ri'c't’s finest
fairway outﬁt. I
Saturday afternoon at the Summit
Country Club, U-niontown, the Pan-
thers maintained their undefeated,
unscored upon ‘record by sending the

. West Virginia, Mountaineers into the

rough, ,9-0, in a match play, best
ball contes‘t. ‘
Showing the same superio1'it'y they
displayed against Duquesne on Wed-
nesday, the'Panthers not only grab-
bed e'ver”y pointbut won the majori-

'ty_ "of matches" by foverwlielming

scores. Tony _-Kay, Pitt’s number 4
man, led. the a’ftern-oo_n’s“medal play
witli a total of 73, one above par.

-.’1-‘wo strokes behind .»K,ay., were the
number 1 and 2 of P-itt’s team, Frank
Souchak and Frank‘ Bonaroti. Bill
Daddio stroked out a 76 and he ‘was
‘followed in the P_an_ther medal play
by Bob Baughman and Eddie Lawry,
both shooting 78s.

Souchak Pressed

Carried to the 18th green for the
-second ‘time in two matches, _Pitt’s
golfing ace, Frank Souchak defeated
Kirk Jackson of the Mountaimnen, 2
up, by winning the last hole. This
was the only match that went the
limit.

Bonaroti found his opponent not
quite so persistent and he ‘triumphed,
6 up and 4.tofgo1f. 'IVeami1"Ig‘togetl1e1",
the two Franks won a best ball
point, 5 and 4. Bonaroti beat West
"Virginia's Graham.

‘Bill Daddio didn’t have "anything
to scare him as he conquered Fear
of West Virginia, 5 and 4. Tony Kay’s
low score didn’t interrupt his match
with Sharpenburg from being’ a
corker. It wasn’t decided until the
17.th.gr‘e'en, when Kay parred out to

"win, 4‘ and 2. Daddio and Kay com-

bined for the best ball point, 3 and
2.

. The other close match was between
Pitt’s Bob Baughman and Weddow,
his West Virginia opponent. Baugl1-
man won out, 2 and 1. Eddie Lawry
in ‘the Pitt number '6 position scored
decisively over Bird, 7 and '6. The
ﬁnal ‘point was tallied by Baughman
and Lawry, 5 and 4.

Point To Win Game As
Urban, Goldberg Star

Saturdays third spring training
game supported the increasingly-
alarming fact that the 1937 football
crew still has a long, hard path ahead
before it will go very far in the In-
tercollegiate fall ‘warfare.

The starting Blues, tentative first-
string line-up, still found it difficult
to cut /down the always-driving
Whites, and it was not until the
starting outﬁt had been juggled
around to some ex'ten't that the only
touchdown of the afternoon was
punched out.

While aman wore. a white shirt
on his back there seemed to "be plen-
ty of drive and power in his cliarge,
but when the color was Blue, he
lacked something. The Whites, as a
team, carried away the play, time and
again. It was only the individual ef-
forts of Goldberg early in the game,
and later Johnny Urban, that made
the Blues an offensive threat.

Possibly Bill Daddio and Frank
Seuchak, vacationing in West Vir-
ginia with the golfers, were missed
a bit, oﬂ"ensively. Anyway, the surg-
ing White forward wall and ba‘cke1's-
up swarmed all over the Big Blues
during ‘the first half of the after-

noon.

Blues Get “Brea.k"

Acting Captain Henry Adams,
snapper-back of the Whites, elected
to receive at the start of the game.
Fabian Hoffman, Blues right end,
showed that he was on his toes by
turning Tony Matisi’s “short” kick-
off into a “break,” as he fell on the
f_reerball_ to give the Blues possession
on the 33-yard line in enemy terri-
tory.

Fighting back, the Whites held the
battering Blues to three yards in
three attempts, only to have Gold-
berg scamper 14 yards ‘to a ﬁrst-—down
on the last try"afte1' at least three
tacklers had a goo'd shot a't the elu-
sive Elkins Flyer.

Then Spotovich, rugged left end, ‘

shot into the backﬁeld and pulled
down Stebbins for a 12-yard loss.
Shea stopped Stebbins just short of
a ﬁrst down ‘two plays later. Three
downs later, fa‘i1'ing to advance, Pat-
rick dropped back and booted to mid-
ﬁeld for the Whites.

Sta.pul'is clipped off .12 yards for .

the second ﬁrst-and-ten of the after-

noon and then, after two line playfs, ._

Mercovsky leaped up from the line
to knock down Stapulis’ pass, forcing
punt formation.

Lateral Click!

Later in the period, Patrick re-
pl-aced Stapulis A
Blue backﬁeld. Driving off left tack-
le, Patrick eluded the backers-up,
and as he was about to be tackled,
lateralled to Stebbins. The play was
good for 'a first down.

Goldberg picked his way to the '
right and sh'ot over for ‘the fou-rth '

first down two plays later, and it

looked like the Blues were star-‘ting -

to go places. However, Tony Matisi

was caught holding, and the ball was ’

moved back 15 yards, where Patrick
stepped back and placed a kick out
of bounds on the 12-yard line.-

Thc Whites were back on the‘ir
heels when Stapulis, with the wind
to his face, booted to Stebb'i‘ns' who,
along with Goldberg, just escaped the
fate that belonged to Goldberg and
La Rue in the fatal Duquesne game
when the two safety-men rubbed
shoulders in going after the falling
punt, fumbled, and then lost the ball
to the on—rushing linemen.

Dickinson threw Stebbins for an
11-yard loss. On the next play, Gold-
berg driving wide‘ to the right was
hit by"/UI'baI1, and su-ﬁ’_ered injuries
to liisle-ft leg. Urban replaced Gold-
berg in the Blue backﬁeld, with Cas-
siano ﬁlling the open position for the
Whites. Urban skipped 12 yards for
another first-and-‘ten, but on the next
fourth down, the ball was short by
inches on the 14-yard line.

Fumbles Fatal

Shea fumbled when he was hit hard
as the half neared its close. Pat-
ricl-: recovered for the Blues, but time
‘was called.

Another fumble by the Whites, this
time by Cassiano, ultimately led to
the lone touchdown. Fabian Hoffman
recovered» shortly after the second
period got under way. With Michel-
osen at the helm, the Blues soon drove
to the score, with Urban and Patrick
doing‘ yeoman duty. Matisi aided
when he recovered Urban’s fumble
for the Blues on the three-yard line.

After three unsuccessful tries, Pat-
rick ﬁnally crashed through for the
Blue score. With Stebbins holding the
ball, Pat hit “dead center” to score
the seventh and ﬁnal point of the
afternoon.

The remainder of the‘ game was
featured by frequent substitutions
‘and determined drives by the Whites
to strike back and tie the score. Far-
kus and ‘Cassiano led the play for
the scrapping seconds. Urban ended
the afternoon with a 20-yard scamper
to stamp himself as one of the most
impressive backs of ‘the afternoon ses-
sion.

Acting Captain Don Hensley, cen-
ter, played a consistent, rugged game
for the Blues, being one of the few
men to last the entire session.

Madden Pressed In Win
Over Peterson As Blatt,
Solow Drop Matches

 

 

A ﬁghting Grove City tennis team
threw a scare into the Panther net-
men before succumbing to Bobby
Madden and his teammates at the
Stadium courts Friday afternoon.

Stan Peterson of the Crimson made
things tough for Madden in his ﬁrst
start of the outdoor season, but the
Pittsburgh Indoor cham'pi0'n came
through to win 6-4, 6-1.

Although Ralph Bald and Johnny
Megan, playing at second and ‘third
positions respectively, managed ‘to win
their ma‘tch'es and lose only one set
between them, a wet ‘spring, ‘showed
its effect upon veteran Irv Solow and
freshmain Larry 'Bla'tt, both of when‘:
were decisively beaten. Ad Hartman
gave the Pitt team ‘its fourth singles
victory. V

Madden and Bald had no trouble
chalking up 21 doubles win over Pet-
erson and Larry Faivre, but the
other two matches were stopped be-
cause of darkness. The total score
of matches completed was 5--2, Pitt.

On Monday nights there are
some 1000 students in class in the
Cathedral, all of them potential
Glee Club members. It is because
of the vast discrepancy between
1000 and twenty-one that the
members of the Club feel certain
that relatively few are aware of
the time and place of the meet-
ings. Of course, with an aug-
mented membership,- more ambi-
tious . programs can be planned’
and more frequent concerts can
