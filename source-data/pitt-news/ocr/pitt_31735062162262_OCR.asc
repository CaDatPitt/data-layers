Posvcir Quits After Selling

- BY
ARTHUR WILLIAM GOTTHEIM

Due to the sale of the University‘
of Pittsburgh to Duquesne Uni-
versity, the Pitt News has been
renamed the Duquesne Duke. The
former Pitt News staff has formed a

commune in the heart of Donora.

' Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
amazingly resigned Sunday shortly
after. he sold the entire Pitt Oakland
campus to Duquesne University.
Costs were not disclosed.

The announcement came at a
well attended press conference
from new chancellor Joseph A.
Dutton. Pitt's Johnstown campus
has not been sold, Dutton reported,
and the school’s headquarters will
be moved to Johnstown shortly.

Circumstances under which the
unique transaction took place are
still rather vague. Posvar gave no
indication last week of the’ surprise
move. ‘ _

Speaking at the news conference
before reporters and thousands of
interested students, Dutton said,
“Former Chancellor Posvar un-
fortunately will not be in Johns-
town with us.

“Soon after he notified me of the
sale, for a price I cannot disclose,
he informed me of his resignation
which is affective, or rather
effective, immediately.”

Dutton said Posvar was leaving
the city but left no indication of his

destination.
“Frankly I can find little reason
for the sale," Dutton said.“We had

been running some ideas up
flagpoles, but after the time
schedule’ controversy, we had
,,decided not to make any more

waves for the students. So I really
don’t know what Posvar was

doing."

As the winter term winds to a
close, Pitt students will not be
affected by the sale, according to
Dutton. ‘

_ The departments of anthro-
pology, philosophy, and geography
no longer exist, however, and

A 25-cent fee to enter any

University building has been

announced by the new Chancellor

' Joseph Dutton who explained that

the extra mo'ney was needed to pay,
for maintenance of the buildings’
doors. - I

“You have no idea how much
wear and tear on»hinges, and the
like occurs,” Dutton said.
where are we supposedto get the
fund to pay for the upkeep. It’s just
another expense that we can't
handle with our present budget.”
— Since the institution of the fee last
week, absolutely no one has
attended any classes or used any
University building. The Univer-
sity is at a standstill, but still
Dutton and the Administration
appear unwilling to relent on the
fee.

Wucky Wesley PuIIsOne Off

BY I. DON BELIFIT
Chancellor Wesley Posvar is
such a modest man, that few

people know about his experiences
during "The Big One" across the
pond. W.W. ll.

“Wucky Wesley," as his bud-
dies used to call him, wasassigned
to the Military Airlift Transporta-
tion, Service (MATS). whose
purpose was to fly the vital supplies
to the troops in order to continue
the war effort. V

Posvar was at first sent to
Burma, where he flew material
“over the hump" as it was
commonly referred to, and was
quoted many times to express his
dissatisfaction with the duty by
thrusting his head out of the pilot's
window as he flew over the hump
yelling"‘l-lump the hump."

After ﬂying over 300 thousand
tons of ping-pong ballsinto China,
“Putty Posvar," as his enemies
called him. was transferred to

Berlin "where he spent the restof

students enrolled,in those depart-
ments are now registered in the
school of business. \-

Officials at Duquesne have
announced the termination of all
football scholordhips. Players not
going to Johnstown but staying on
at the_ new University are being
encouraged to try out for the newly
forming water polo team.i

Athletic director Red Manning
has announced plans to flood Pitt
Stadium rennovating it as Amer-
ica’s first stadium used exclusively
for water polo.

“Former football
Ma_jors is welcome to stay on as
calisthenics coordinator for the
water polo squad,“-Manning said.
“We’re optimistic he’ll join the
squad.”

Student-athletes at Pitt enjoy a
preferred status that grants them
gourmet meals, access’ to women of
questionable morals, -salaries that
extend into six figures, lush living
quarters, grades of their choice,
transportation by sedan chair to
practices, manservants, and any-
thing else their little hearts desire.

A typical .week’s training table
menu consists of such delicacies as

‘surf and turf, ﬁlet mignon, lobster

“Wucky .Wesley’l in his ﬂight gear [circa 1945]

 

tail, prime rib, cornish hen, and
stuffed shrimp, according to the
athletic department's head trainer.

“‘The‘athletes eat like kings,”
the trainer told the Pitt News.
“The meals are prepared by some
of the finest chefs in town. The
athletic department hired away
these chefs from restaurants like
The- Edge," LeMont, Top of the
Triangle, Sg_ro’s, and Park Schen-
ley. But remember. this interview
never took place.”

But football player Tom Perk-up
disputed this description of train-
ing table meals. “Nonsense!”
Perk-up declared. “Why _just last
week we ate plain rib steaks.
Bleah! And a couple of months
ago, we got fried chicken!"

Of course, not all athletes eat
this well. The women’s» swimming
team eats plain old Szabo food just
like the rest of‘ the ‘dormitory
students. When asked if this meal
disparity constitutes unequal treat-
ment of women, Athletic Director
Casimir Mysolooski said, “Not on
our part. I can’t help it if no one
will pay to see our girls swim. I
sure can't blame them though.”

Athletes (male that is) are given .

access to certain female compan-
ionship free of cost and in the
convenience of their qwn- rooms.
These young ladies are recruited by
assistant coaches and trainers’ in
some downtown areas and brought
to the dorms by University
vehicles, according to a local
madame.

"I'm sure the boys are satisfied--
I mean pleased--with our girls,”
the madame said. “We send only
our best ones to our steadiest
customers.”

High salaries are paid to all Pitt
athletes, too, according to Univer-
sity Treasurer David M. Jones.

M “It’s a ﬂexible scale, you see,’’i

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
In line with Supreme Court
‘ guidelines for capital punishment,
 the Pennsylvania House and
‘ Senate have suggested amend-
ments to , the controversial bill
EV reinstating the death penalty.

. One of the proposals would make
farting in church a capital offense,
and according to the amendment's
sponsor Representative John Y.
‘ Lear, this particular offense has
grown to dangerous proportions
over the last three years.

‘‘It has gotten out of hand,” Lear
said, “the farting element in
society thinks it can get away with
desecrating our most sacred
places". Well, I think capital
a punishment will provide the
’ necessary deterrent.”

A Lear noted many House mem-
. bers would have supported senten-
cing an offender of this particular
. , statute to death two or three times.
_but energy considerations stayed
their hands. “You have to
remember we have an energy crisis
in this country," Lear said. We
could heat twelve homes for three
’ hours with the juice we pump into
 one offender."
A Another amendment would make

the telling of elephant iokes an
offense punishable by death.

Congressman Willy Knierber-
boben denounced what he called a
“lax" attitude on the part of the
Shapp administration towards the
elephant ioke offense.

“lt’s gotten to the point,"
Knieberboben said, “where an-
other wave of elephant iokes could
throw this country over the edge.
We must act now or later
generations will pay the price.

“I have FBI figures which
indicate elephant jokes were told
by nearly 80% of the American
public last year, of that 80%,
nearly half were the one about the
elephant hiding in the cherry
tree, “see how well he hides,”
which is a particularly reprehen-
sible example.”

Knieberboben advocated the
set-up of a federal elephant-ioke
task force to quell the rising
occurrence of the offense, and an
Elephant Joke Hotline so people
/can report serious offenders
directly to the FBI in Washington,
D.C.

Among the other amendments to
the death-penalty bill were pro-
posals making actions such as

the war ferrying condoms and other
vital supplies to the occupation
troops in West Berlin.

He was by this time, flying in a
C-47 aircraft with the inscription of
“Wucky Wesley" painted on the
side. and on three occasions had
the misfortune of running out of
gas while over the Russian's
occupied territory of East Ger-
many. It was here that he met
Joseph Dutton, who was hard at
work trying out subversive opera-
tions on the Russians. Dutton, who
was working undercover for the
O.S.S.. saved Wesley (as he calls
Wucky) from a fate worse than
death, as his plane ran out of fuel
that fateful day.

As Wucky tells it, it was Dutton
that was the hero of the day.
Dutton insists, however. that
Wesley had his finest hour trying to

land his plane with the engines
dead.

“Trying to land a dead engined
C-47 loaded with 10,000 pounds of
ﬁsh-meal fertilizer on board takes a
lot of guts,” Dutton said.

“First of all, a C-47 without any
engines is like Johnathan Living-
ston Seagull loaded with the
buckshot of both barrels of a
12-guage shotgun. The only way to
go is down. --

“Secondly. Dutton continued.
“if Wesley didn’t bring the plane
into a reasonably smooth landing,
and the cargo-hold broke open with
all that fish-meal aboard, you can't
imagine the stink. Hell, it would
have smelled like the Tuck Shop.
Wesley really pulled it off that
day."

Needless to say, Wesley did
“pull it off” that day, and the
evidence sits in his office in the

A The Student Government Board
decided at it's meeting Wednesday
that the situation had reached the
critical stage. Negotiations with
Dutton will begin when the Board

, receives a report from its Ad-Hoc

Investigating Committee.

One Board member expressed
outrage at the fact he was charged
to enter the Student Union for a
Board meeting. “The University
should at least exempt members of
the SG Board from paying the

~ building entrance fee," he said.
"This just gives more justification
for Board members to receive
remunerations."

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg sent a letter to
the Board of Trustees stating that
faculty members were gravely
concerned about new policy and the
effect that classrooms would have
on faculty iobs. “If this trend
continues, its very possible that
Dutton may recommend the elimi-
nation of all faculty positions as a
cost saving measure," Rosenberg
said.

Lord Spoke Unto Noah

BY LOIS LANE

The sinking of Benedum hall was
the subject of an impromtu meeting
betwcecn the Lord. and the keeper
of that building, Noah Boman

Sunday. The following is this
‘reporter's account of that meeting.
I Noah Boman was already seated
when the Lord; black robes
flowing. entered the cloud-
saturatcd hall.

“We've got a problem, Lord."

“Yes, I know, Noah."

"Well, there must be some
explanation. Buildings don’t iust
sink into the earth every day. I
demand an investigation!"

"It was meant to be, Noah."

“What?"

"Build a helicopter. Noah."

“A what?"

“A helicopter."

“But shouldn't I consult Vice
Chancellor Dut-"

“Blasphemy! Purge your false
idols, Noah. Follow the paths of

righteousness."

“But Lord, all the students can't
tit into one helicopter."

“Take only those who know the
Lord."

“You mean..."

“Yes. Noah. The Greeks must
sink. Remember Noah, take them
in twos. one man and one woman to
a pair."

“But Lord. there aren't that many
women in the School of Engi-
neering."

“That's your tough luck, Noah. I
warned you about that Equal
Rights Amendment."

“Lord, uh-um what about the-
um..."

"The Gay people, Noah?"

“Uh-yes, Lord.” .
“To them I declare special
clemency. they've taken enough
shit. Noah."

"Well, where are we going in this
helicopter. Lord?"
“Well. there's always my house."

“Ah. we went to your house back
in '72 for the east coast flood..."

“Don't play games with me,
Noah. That wasn't my flood. That
was Agnes’ ﬁasco."

“Alright. Lord. What time will
you be expecting us?"

"Not before midnight. And don't
forget the Tecquilla."

Priceless Mole
Theft Rocks Zoo,-

Authorities Baffled

BY ROVER HADDOG

The FBI is investigating the
possibility that one-time billionaire
Rody Schmoduel was involved in
the theft of the world famous
Lincoln Mole last weekend from the
Pittsburgh Zoo.

A business card found in the
mole cage at the zoo led local police,
to Schmoduel who now shares a
room with his brother-in-law in a
Liberty Avenue hotel. The case
was then turned over to the FBI.
Pittsburgh Police Chief Alex Grabb
said, “This case is iust too hot for
us to handle."

The business card said to be
from Schmoduel's former com-
pany, a local employment agency,

vi had his full name printed across the

bottom. _.

“If he didn’t steal it,” said
Pittsburgh FBI Director John
Monohand, referring to the mole,
‘‘I’d like to know what his business
card was doing in the cage.”

The Lincoln‘ Mole is the last
surviving full ancestor of President
Lincoln’s pet mole and was here for
the weekend white in transit to
Springfield, Illinois for next week's
celebration of Lincoln's true
birthday.

Football coach Johnny »Minors
and basketball coach Booze Riddle
explained the grading system. “Ya

final grades." Minors said. “those
good oi‘ boys down thar at
registration send them up to our
offices where our players can look
'em over and, ya know, kinda
change ‘em around a little if they
like.

“Then we send them good oi‘

Riddle observed, “You can’t

gotta ‘play basketball and get back

Coincidentally. a check of ath-

The‘ announcement came as no
' rise to the staff. This is the
_ issue of the Pitt News.
I oth Student Government and the
 versity administration have
u thdrawn their ﬁnancial support
ﬁ-‘om S the paper. Last week
gf”clv'ertising,revenue dropped to an
ill! new low point. Because of the
inﬂationary situation the paper
cannot continue to operate.
According to knowledgeable
urces, however, the paper was
the victim of a plot_ intended to
= mandate its shutdown. The SG
1 ocations Committee contends
thqshutdown of the Pitt News was
a_i:t"of the University’s southern
str_ategy. Now _the Pitt News can
ilivulge this controversial and
secret information.
The beginning of the end began
-North Carolina during the NCAA
fnament. Chancellor Wesley
Posvar and SG President Mike
A’ iirick agreed the Pitt News was no
longer a “responsible” campus

 
      
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
    
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
   
   
   
    
   
  
 

 
  
  

sentatives unplugged the Assoc-
iated Press machine in the Pitt
News offices. Thismarked the end
of 68 years of collegiate iournalism
on the Pitt campus.

The shutdown of the paper
however, was only one aspect of
the University's.strategy. Alfred
Moye, Vice-Chancellor of4Student
Affairs, contends the University is
attempting to “control" SG rep-
resentatives in return for “sepcial
favors," such as the NCAA iunket.

This matter is so sensitive, even
the Pitt News cannot divulge
anymore information, except that
we have learned three members of
the SGB, Furick, Bruce Keeler, and
Paul Hertnecky, now have girl-
friends, which ‘they did not have
before the North Caroline incident.

In the past few weeks the paper
has continuously criticized the
University administration and Stu-
dent Government. _ Apparently,
this is the reason for the Pitt News
shutdown.

It is clear the Pitt News is at fault

.cents an issue."

ml

since he plans to run for Congress
someday.

Big Mac (as he is known in Pitt
News circles) summarized his

‘ feelings when he said, “Now I

cannot get those satanic symbols of
corruption (the University admin-
istration) anymore." ’

However, the Chancellor has
recognized MacLeod’s abilities.
Dr. Posvar has appointed the
former editor Vice-Chancellor of
Business and Finance succeeding
Joseph A. Dutton. Dutton left his
office to serve as editor and
business manager of Update.

According_ to Dutton students
“will be required to subscribe to
the propaganda newspaper for 10
Dutton should be
congratulated for his cost cutting
measures.’

This added income will be used
to convert the former Pitt News
offices into a gymnasium for
faculty. so they do not have to walk
all the way to Trees Hall for their
physical exercise.

have been written by George Zrust

“John Conti"?)
Whichever nameis the pseudo-

“Now, thanks to you and your fine
comrades," Jebson continued, ‘‘I
see how much ‘of a hoax it was.
And for the limited physical
pleasure 1 derived from fraternity

have suffered.” ‘

Jebson talked about-his involve-

Jebson said the blood he once
shed for fraternities was so
alcoholic that it was anti-freeze, but
that the blood he will in thenfuture

never freeze because it is laden
with true human warmth.

iustifiably so, as you can see.
Therefore, holding him up as an

“Certainly if someone farts in

cheek," he said.

Reports from the Supreme
Court's Judicial Committee on
Capital Punishment indicate many
states are following Pennsylvania
in reinstatement of the death
penalty and the nation is now
returning to stricter punishment of
criminal offenses. ‘

“We’re not sure,” said a judicial
committee representative, “but
Delaware is on the brink of making

be a few hitches because some nut
in Massachusetts has proposed
that making proposals about the
death penalty be punishable by
death and things have sort of
ground to a halt up there,” the
representative said, “But all in all
it’s been a lot of fun."

Bassy Van Cleef, a noted lawyer
in a New York firm may be the first
counselor to spring a client under
the new laws.

“That's the breaks. The new
laws didn't say anything about the
victim being under 6 foot 3, and I
can't see how you can sentence a

man for a crime the state hasn't

recognized. _

“I'll have my client back out on
the street before you can say Jack
the Ripper."

So far, according to .national
sources, there is no winner to the
all-state race to execute the first
capital offender. Although Mary-
land was declared a premature
victor in the hanging death of an
inmate at the Black Hole Rehabili-
tation Clinic for the Socially
Maladjusted, reports indicate it
was really a suicide.

Texas state representative Errol
Big said his state would come out
on top, with the first hanging
scheduled for early next week.

“We had to stretch it a little, I
mean, he was picked up for a
non-moving traffic violation, but
the prosecutor came through and
the jury was enthusiastic." Big
said, “Besides, this guy had a

just couldn't stand. He ‘deserves

Priceless Mole

Theft Rocks Zoo

Authorities Baffled

(Co7zti71ue(l from Paye 3)

According to Monohand. the
mole was discovered missing
Saturday about six am by the zoo
keeper who also noticed that the
mole's water dish and pillow were
gone. This has led some
authorities to believe the mole is
being kept alive.

“We don’t know what he’s done A

with it,” Monohand said, “but we
know Schmoduel took it. He might
have killed it, he might have sold it.

All we know is his card was found
in the cage.” '

A theory has been advanced that
perhaps someone planted the card.
City Criminologist Eric Slanto said
“Nobody would be so"stupid as to
leave a card with their name on it at
the scene of a crime.”

Schmoduel’-s own psychoanalyst,
however, disagrees. “Rody often
left his business cards behind.
Under plates in diners, in people's
mailboxes. He liked to remind
people of how he used to be a
billionaire and president of his own
company,'.' said Dr. Louis Tera.

He could not say what would
cause Schmoduel to _steal the
Lincoln Mole, however.

A Schmoduel has been released on
10,000 dollars bond in custody of
his brother-in-law to await further
investigation.

City police equipped with riot gear

were beaten back repeatedly by the
feisty females. Transit buses
commandeered by the police pulled
up to barricade Grandview Ave for
blocks.

The tambourinist was late, and
some fans mounted utility poles to
look for his auto. The crowd,
growing increasingly restless,
began to chant “Huck Q! Huck

A roar went up as Huck’s 1949

bodyguards shortly before the girls
upset the car, burned it, and rolled
it down the face of Mt. Washing-
ton. Huck's chauffeur, Rocky
Downshift, escaped with only split
pants.

“Let's check out this dump,”
reporter Maloney said. We left our
car and worked our way through
the mass of bodies, at several
points having to slap the fans silly
with our notebooks.

Once inside, we-saw that Huck
had been confronted by Vet -another
mob. Huck shook violently. even
though he is the holder of a coveted
paisleybelt in karate: Fortunately,
he wascatapulted over the crowd
by a tag-team of Sumo wrestlers
who remembered him from his last
Asian tour.

Tension was high as the house-
lights dimmed. The bar was silent,
save for the faint slapping sounds
heard as two detectives worked

over Huck's manager Willie
“Joe-Bob" Nurn with rubber
hoses in the men's room. (They

had caught him hawking Juiy
Fruits outside Mahoney's without,
and peddling 8" X 10" glossies of
Huck. We managed to obtain
several photos).

A hayseed emcee stumbled
through an introduction as Huck
tuned’ his tambourines. Huck
picked up this emcee last summer
during his tour through the
Midwest in an open-door boxcar.

“Debut is nice up here,” said Huck of his Mt. Washington exposure.

But as he beat out a few bars on
his tambourine to warm up, the
crowd was again entranced. His
tambourine hung to his knees from
a green strap, iust like Johnny
Appleseed's sack. V

Then Huck read several of this fan
letters that had been piling up at
the hotel
Tuesday on the riverboat “Warsaw
Queen."

Goaded by audience requests,
Huck revealed the secrets of his
meteoric rise in the glittery world
of show business. His first big job
came in 1965, when he played a
week in thethird stall of the men’s

room at the Brady’s Bend Hilton.
In that time, show prices soared
from a dime to 15 cents.

We sat sipping on our drinks
(Zrust’s a “Shooting Star", and

' Maloney’s a “Jump Up and Kiss

Me"--provided at double price by
the bartender). The crowd was in
tears. A table of six girls next to us
was reminiscent of a scene from
“Manhunt.”

Then I-luck ﬂashed into a set of his
early hits including" the biblical

ballad on pig-raising called “The

Days of Swine and Moses.”

He followed with what was
probably the highlight ‘of his
performance, “I Want To Hold
Your Tambourine“, which he,

belted out on his acoustic tambou-

rine [one of the ampliﬁers had been
And in honor of the
cigarette haz'e-laden atmosphere,
Huck "smoked through a golden
dusty, “Nicotine Tambourine.” b

As he closed the first show, the

scene outside Mahoney’s was
bedlam. Grandview Ave. shops
had been ransacked by

throngs of frenzied 30-year-'

olds. Police again charged‘, backed
up by five of their meat wagons,
and scooped up an estimated 160
writhing groupies. According to
police inspector Ramone DeBone,
who was on hand, such scenes are
“business as usual" wherever
Huck goes.

In his dressing room afterwards,
we cornered Huck for a quick
interview. Although he was at first
reluctant to speak with the press,
he soon played into our hands.

After he regained consciousness,

he was happy to talk to us.

simply a matter of appreciation. If
an old lady draws a st_ick figure,
and she herself appreciates it,
then... it is art. Does this imply
that the shepherd's penis is art
because the ewe appreciated ‘it?
And I know that once such a silly
theory is formulated, it is very well
impossible to argue it.. .so what can
I say...well, the old lady's stick

F rosh Phenom Inks
Pact In Hospital Bed

BY BYRON COPE

The Pitt Football program re-
ceived a serious blow over the
weekend as All-American running
back Tony Dorsett announced that
he was skipping the rest,of his
collegiate career to iump to the
newly founded World Football
League. 4 ~

The announcement was made
from a room at Presbyterian
Hospital where Dorsett was ad-
mitted for multiple iniuries, which
he alledgedly sustained following
his last practice in a Pitt uniform
Saturday afternoon.

Dorsett was found shortly after
the scrimmage behind a_Stadi_um
concession stand with both legs
broken and a possible skull
fracture, according to a report filed
by emergency room attendants at
the hospital. '

The announcement concerning
the move to the new league was
made at the hospital by Dorsett7s
agent, Rufus Bucknell. Dorsett.
refused to comment on the matter
primarily because he had not
regained consciousness from the
beating. _ 1

“Man, Tony's fed up with all this
shit," Bucknell said. “Why, just

take dat ‘honkie‘ Heisman Trophy‘

shit. Everyone knows Tony
shoulda got it. We ain't gotta put
up with noe of dat.”

According to Bucknell, Dorsett
signed a multi-year $10 million plus

Pitt Gets All-

Female Football

Women’s libbers/--take heart.
Next fall at Pitt, not only will there
be a men's varsity football'team,
but a girl's grid squad too.

Newly appointed Athletic Di-
rector “Tiger Paul” has appropri-
ated funds for the formation of an
all-female football squad. ‘Citing
federal rules that stipulate wo-

men's varsity programs must share.

a proportional amount of monies
funded for varsity athletics or the
University's total sports expendi-
tures be cut, “Tiger” has set aside
$300,000 to fund the girls team.

Roberta “BuIl-Dyke” Benson,
who played five years as a
defensive tackle for the Chicago
Bears before Dick Butkus exposed
her secret to the NFL after getting
a good look at her in an obscure
corner of the locker room, was
named as coach of the team for the
upcoming campaign.

Benson immediately requested
for enough financial backing to take
‘a recruiting trip through Denmark
and Sweden, to scout the infamous
Scandinavian Women's League. '

“Fuckin’-A,” Benson- said, “by
next September I_’ll have my
women ready to take on Johnny

Majors and the whole football.

team, before or after the game.”
The only problem in finances,
accordingito “Tiger,” is the $1000
worth of extra iock straps he has
ordered. ” . ' '

Philadelphia Bell of the infant
WFL.

“The NCAA is nothin’ but iive,
“Be-
sides, Tony's gettin' more than just
$10 million. I mean, like the team
is half his, the town gonna be his
and he's gettin' a new Cadillac
every other day. Shit, when one his
cars gets dirty--they just gonna buy
him a new one." -

Pitt head coach Johnny Maiors,
who was seen by one eye witness
leaving the Stadium shortly before
Dorsett was found under the
bleachers, denied having any
knowledge of the contract prior to
the official announcement. '

“I can only hope Tony a" speedy
recovery,” Majors said with broad
grin,“..if he walks again. But we
all know what kind of competitor
Tony is, I’m positive he won’t let a
little thing like this get him down.”

Newly appointed Athletic Director

Tiger Paul openly admitted having“

knowledge of the WFL's efforts at

-wooing Dorsett out of “academic"

life, however, and tried himself to
keep Pitt's football sensation in
school.

“I can’t understand why Tony
wanted to leave us,” Tiger
remorsely remarked. “We offered
him a gold throne, a gold crown, a
gold robe, a gold Lincoln Conti-
nental and all the fried chicken and
watermellon he could eat...maybe
he doesn’t like fried chicken?” —

and would be financed with funds
appropriated for the rennovation of
his office._

“Tiger” said that athletics at Pitt
were becoming unnecessary. “I
think there should be more room at
court side and on the sidelines for
cheerleaders. Eventually, sports
events can be eliminated com-
pletely and cheerleading will take
over the limelight. Along with
limelights, I hope to have installed
pink and green lights also.”

Tiger said that funds for football
would be cut in half with the extra
going to basketball. “Why
shouldn't 1?", he chuckled, satur-
ated with his new power.

When asked how being a paper
boy would help him in his new
duties, “Tiger" said that it was
“the perfect conditioning for any
athletic directors primary function;
collecting money."

“Tiger” is reportedly having try
outs for positions on his staff.

Applicants must have crew-cuts,

tennis shoes and be willing to
sweat in public.

The new A.D. emphasized the
aspect of enthusiasm in his
upcoming proposals, but not
necessarily pride. After a brief
sprint ground the basketball court.
Tiger elaborated on the subject.

"People made fun of me, being a *

paperboy and all. And they'll make
fun of me as athletic director too.

their
recent

investigation of the Pitt wrestling
programhas found that there exists
a special training room in the
basement of Trees Gvm which the
ixrestlcijs have fondly named “The

it is rumored that Coach Dave
Madman has used the room to turn

most effective of all of them being

Metrical to the more stubborn
athletes.
Whatever the methods, the

results speak for themselves. After
such a marvelous season, the
mentor could but say one thing.

“Fromhere, the only direction
we can go is up.” i

Darlin' Dave, as all the wrestlers
like to call him. then proceeded to
take this reporter on a special
guided tour of his little funhouse.

“Over here we have the
weighted-pendulum device. A
wrestler is required to life the
barbells over his head within five
seconds or the pendulum will swing
down and cut off his arm. We feel
that this adds a little incentive to
the wrestler’s basic ability to
excel.”

“On the other side of the room,
we havethe Iron Maiden bench

keep the weight above his head for
a full minut_e or the spikes that are

small spring that automatically 

releases when the minute is up."

Madman did go on to say that the
Iron Maiden is not foolproof and a
few wrestlers have been iniured,
“but," said Madman, “we really
can’t worry too much about that, as
long as the job gets done and the
guys are in shape when the season
starts." - i

T “You of course know that
lifting weight is the smallest part of
training. The most important thing

of all is giving the wrestlers the

on-the-mat experience. That’s why
we have Little Bubba,” said the
mentor as he showed off his prized
possession.

Little Bubba is a seven foot, one
ton bear and any wrestler who
survives his bout with what
Madman likes to call “my son,"
automatically is on the team.
Those who don't? “We don’t talk
about it," commented the grapling
Coach. “We just figure that
someone who doesn't make it with
Little Bubba doesn't deserve to be
on the team anyhow."

“I think 1 might also like to
mention that the interior decorat-

‘ing in this room was done by the

Marquis de Sade. His character
fills every corner of the room and I
feel I can really identify with it,"
said the wrestling mentor.

“The most important thing about
this training program ‘is not only
does it develop character, but it
brings the team together and
unites them towards one solid goal,
although I doubt sometimes
whether or not they really
appreciate what I’m doing for
them,” said Madman.

“More than once I've found
cyanide in my lunch but luckily my
taste testers found it for me. They
were really good boys. and I'm sure
that'they could have been good
wrestlers."

“I'm sure that this is just the
work of a few misguided souls who
don't know what a favor I'm doing
‘for them letting them wrestle for
Pitt." said Madman.

Your ten seconds are up. If you
haven't already guessed (or forgot
to read the beginning of the article)
the answer is of course Swap

Swap Senorita is ‘a remarkable
book. I mean who needs the

Swap Senorita avoids the frills

Kathy Pruitt doesn't let plot or

The book does have a plot but it is
only used as a framework for
Pruitt‘s vividly decribed scenes.
All you traditionalists probably

make you feel better, here goes.
Kathy Pruitt describes how, being
