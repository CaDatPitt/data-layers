To Examine Health Fee

"BY CONNIE GIEL

A student consumer board has
been formed by the Student Health‘
Service to evaluate the proposed
mandatory student health fee.

The board, made up of repre-
sentatives from graduate and
undergraduate organizations, will
5-zducate students about the fee and
the services it includes. Its
immediate concern is to ensure
student needs are considered when
the Board of Trustees votes to
endorse or reject the fee at a May
18 meeting.

The fee. $16 per term for all full-
time students, has been approved
by the Chancellor as a means of
funding the'Student Health Service
next year.

“Students are consumers, and
the product in this case is the
Student Health Service,” Health
Service Director Dr. Joanne Robin-

3}*son said.

   
   

With its input stopping just short
of decision-making authority, the
consumer board will make sure the
fee meets the health needs of
students, Student Government

Board member Larry Krain said.
“We're there to advise the
Health Service of these needs, as
well as inform students about the
things the fee may cover," he said.
Robinson’ said the board con-
siders the fee a service to students,
not a tax. “Once students see the
broad range of services included in
the sixteen dollars, they may
recognize it as a bargain,” she

~ said.

Black Action Society member
George Van Hook said he was
philosophically opposed to the idea
of a fee--“health care for students
should be free"--but said he
believes the fee is inevitable and
that he will’ try to get students the
best care possible under it.

“Since it's too late to do much
about not having a fee, this board
should try to make the fee cheap
and cover as many things as
possible," he said.

A work sheet of proposed_

available service, prepared by
Robinson and approved by the
board. includes physician services‘
such as dermatology, gynecology.

Community charges of irrespon-
sible behavior and harrassment
leveled against six Bayard Street

fraternities, if proven correct, could

result in the heaviest penalties
ever imposed on a Pitt fraternity,
according to Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Alfred Move.

“We've received word from
several citizens who've complained
of harrassment," Moye said, “and
the people making these -charges
are very reasonable people.

“There is no reason to believe
these charges are exaggerations or
lies," he said, “but we have to talk
with the fraternities to get their
side of the story.”

, “The charges may or may not be
exaggerated, ” lnterfraternity
Council (IFC) president Jay Mc-

Namara said Monday. “Also, a
lot of neighbors feel differently, but
some are angry about what's goin

Union Campaign pRe,vving Up

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

May 12 will be the date of a-

union election for Pitt support
personnel and the campaign
already shows signs of heating up
with the appearance of group
campaigning against unionization.

The May election is the
‘culmination of a drive by two union
organizations, the University of
Pittsburgh Support Personnel
Association (UPSPA) and the
American Federation of State.

Tive said he believes remunera-
tions were dropped during the past
two school years because the SGB
wanted individual job performance
-evaluated in determining salary
amount. He said the committee
was not created to make this type of
decision.

According to SGB member Robin

Wertkin, remunerations were re- '
instated this year to compensate for‘

the time and effort many students
put into their positions.

“Some of these jobs consume so
much time that-students can't get a

(AFSCME).

The petition for the May election
was submitted jointly by the
University administration and
UPSPA on December 11, with
AFSCME requesting to enter the
race the next day. The ballot will
include UPSPA, AFSCME and the
“No Representative” option.

An anti-union organization, the
Staff Non-Union Group (SNUG),
last week began a campaign
advocating a no-union vote in the
May election.

Some support personnel see
unionization as a means of
equalizing pay and fringe beneﬁts

with state levels, claiming support

SNUG claims union promises

cannot be guaranteed and contends
many of the services the union
would provide are already available
on campus at no cost to th
employe. -
“The unions talk about money as

representative. said. “They don't
say where all of the money is going
to come from, and some things they

Assertion, Not Aggression

BY NANCY WINTNER

Assertion training workshops--

' programs in self improvement--are

spreading like wildﬁre throughout

-the country; and Pitt students and

faculty will be exposed to programs
offered for the first time during the
current spring and summer terms,
according to Dr. Warren Hill,
psychologist and counselor at the
University Counseling Center.

Given as two separate work-
shops, May 10 and June 28, at the
University’s Counseling Center,

‘faiithe as_serting programs consist of

groups of eight to twelve people
who focus on exercises and
procedures aimed at strengthening
an individual’s conﬁdence. Hill,
head of the assertion workshops,
said the programs make an
individual less fearful in interaction
and basically teach a manner of
handling everyday situations with

parents, friends and employers.

“But it’s not an encounter or
sensitivity group,” Hill stressed.

Participants aren’t threatened or
criticized and he added there is no
negative feedback tossed back and
forth. -

“Sensitivity” groups are un-

<~”T‘3;structured, according to Hill,
“where everyone just sits around.”

‘!"\-J);
_34

However, assertion groups are
organized,.having group leaders
“who always give the people things
to do.”

The term assertion, as opposed

_to aggression refers to “getting

what you want in a socially
excepted manner without doing so
at another’s expense," Hill ex-
plained.

Because he expects 150 partici-
pants at the spring workshop, Hill
is presently training 13 qualiﬁed
counselors to be group leaders.
Each of the counselors have
masters degrees in education,

‘ counseling, or rehabilitation._

During the seminar, workshop
participants are presented with
situations and practice solving
them as if in a real situation. “How
do you handle your best friend who
comes an hour late to dinner?” is
one example‘ of the exercises
provided. Another example
situation involves asking a boss for
a raise by practicing it three
ways--assertively, nonassertively
and aggressively. However, one of
the main activities used is role
playing, Hill said. ‘

The type of person involved in
this program is “the normal person
interested in improving himself,”
Hill said. “It’s not- a therapy
group and not for the psychologi-
cally damaged.” .v ’

Often, people wonder what

- characteristics make a person more

assertive. Hill says high self-
esteem is an important ingredient.

“The more assertive person has
a positive attitude toward him-
self,” the psychologist com-
mented. “He feels that he has
every reason to have his needs

satisﬁed and every reason to be

Although the assertion program

is helpful to everyone regardless of

sex Hill said he feels it's most

beneﬁcial to women.

“Women in particular are, more
concerned with being self-
sufﬁcient,” Hill said.  “There is
more competition with getting out
and experiencing new horizons.
And in order to do this, women
need _more assertiveness."

Our culture teaches women to be
more passive, he said, and
consequently, they express ‘less
conﬁdence when competing with
men. ’

“If there’s anything we all share

presently in this culture, it is a _

general feeling of powerlessness
and impudence,” Hill said. “This
assertion training is needed to
respond to this vague feeling of
powerlessness.” '

  Too Little; Too Late

It is easy to take a critical view of everything; to sit back from a safe
distance and nod knowingly when things don’t go quite right.
Unfortunately, it has become all too easy to criticize the Student
Government Board’s (SGB) sluggish and ineffectual campaign against
the. impending tuition hike. , .

The SGB knew about the hike before it took ofﬁce; it was a major I

‘issue in the Student Government elections last February. When asked

P , if there were any circumstances under which he would support a tuition

hike, SGB President Barry Weisband said, “No. Not at this point,

. because we are not shown exactly where the money is needed.‘I would

like to see a student representative at the budget meetings, and I
' would want to see exactly why tuition needs to be hiked.”

SGB has had several meetings with the Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Planning and Budget, Jack Freeman, and has received sortie
information about the University budget, and this certainly is a step in
the right direction—-but now that they have obtained the infomiaﬁon,
what are they going to do with it? And what ever became of the plan to
have student representatives at departmental budget meetings?

During the campaign, Weisband said he would ﬁght the tuition
increase with "student demonstrations. Except for the rally during the
last week of winter term, there were no demonstrations. If SGB wished
to involve the student body in their plans, they waited too long.

. SGB also has contacted local legislators to ﬁnd out their stand on the
tuition increase, and, ﬁnally, have sent a letter to parents of Pitt
students (see below) asking parents to pressure the state legislature in
efforts to change Harrisburg’s attitude toward public education. The
letter, like most of SGB’s actions, is a good idea, but it is too little and
too late. ' ' '

The state legislators will vote on the state budget very soon, perhaps
as soon as next week. At this point, anything SGB does will be a waste
and misdirection of energy. It is time to go on to other things and more
importantly to start working to prevent any tuition hike in the coming
year.

In any event, what SGB has done so far to ﬁght the tuition increase is
not unlike using a paper fan to blow out a forest ﬁre. During the spring

‘ break,‘ when there was important work to be done, many SGB members

were absent, and those who were here seemed unmotivated.
We can only hope their future performances will be more impressive

 and that they startworking on tomorrow's problems today.

 P   SGB Letter To Parents

Dear Parent(s):

Last year, the University of Pittsburgh requested 62.1 million in
funding from the State of Pennsylvania. The University ultimately
received only $58.3 million, resulting in a tuition increase of $70 per
term. This year, Pitt has asked the legislature for 68.5 million, and at
this juncture, it ‘appears the school will receive only 59.9 million.

Should the situation remain the same, the result is obvious. Pitt will
onceagain be forced to raise tuition. The reasons for the situation are
equally obvious. First, a slender budget to avoid a tax increase is a

, standard election year ﬁxture. Rumors from- Harrisburg. however,
indicate a tax increase to follow the November elections. Second, the

legislature has decided upon higher rates of tuition at public schools._
' This, of course, defeats the purpose of the public schools to make

quality education available at a reasonable cost. Pitt, according to
“.Parade" magazine, charged the third highest tuition of all
state—r.elated schoolsin the nation.’ This was before last year's tuition
hike. "

The legislature has been elected to serve the needs of their
constituents. We ask that you contact your legislators, and urge them
to support increased funding for higher education. Phone, write, send
a telegram, for it is only by way of public pressure on the legislature
that we can alter their attitude toward higher education.

Please, do it today!

Scarlet Letters

BY MICHAEL ROUTH

More serious than it perhaps at first seems to be,
the damage caused by the collapse of college grading
standards during the past decade has already been
too long ignored. Quite simply: too many students
are receiving too many ‘ A’s and B’s. and——less
obviously, and a much nastier topic to boot—very few
students, no matter how incompetent, are being
ﬂunked. ’

Probably nobody has ever accused the American
university‘ of overusing common sense or, indeed, of
even using it at all. Presumably the bastion of the
rational mind, the university is itself frequently run
irrationally. And grade inflation provides a case in
point. For (extremely unusual situations aside),
when over half the students receive A’s and B's, the
exceptional is no longer exceptional, and the system
of ‘evaluation is rendered meaningless. As Gilbert
and Sullivan observed, when everybody’_s somebody,
nobody’s anybody. Or. as Shaw put it, “In heaven an
angel is nobody in particular.”

And let us dismiss at once the idea we sometimes
hear used to account for inﬂated grades that students
are somehow better today. This presupposes that
students of the past decade either benefitted from~
some miraculous leap forward in the evolutionary
process, or that their precollege teachers nationwide
suddenly developed new and dazzling techniques
that somehow had escaped A other teachers for
thousands of years. Suspicious hypotheses, these.

I recall listening at a teacher's workshop to one
professor explain his grading scale as consisting of
A, B, C, and “No Credit.” F’s and D’s, he held,
were somehow punitive——though he never got
around to explaining how a grade of “No Credit”

, differed from an F, or how a_C in his system wasn’t as

“punitive” as the traditional. D. “We’re all
humanists," he kept saying, implying that therefore
we should all- grade easily. 4

I" have yet to discover whose humanism this A 
professor had’in mind; but the idea that no one must

fail is at best unrealistic. Besides providing rather a
dubious deﬁnition of success, such an idea is

' damaging to a student's intellectual growth. For,

like other people, students tend to come up to the‘
standards set for them. Lower standards, or abolish
them all -together, and—educational pop psychology
theories or no—in most cases the result will be lower
performance.

Of course such reasoning carries with it far too

great a burden of common sense to be of use to the
university. Yet we see this sort of reasoning used
elsewhere quite frequently, often in -far more
mundane settings. In a recent advertisement an
international airline emphasizes its rigid standards

for selecting pilots; imagine your reaction to this ‘

airline if its ad were to read: “We let just about

‘anyone fly our planes.” But that in effect, is what ‘
happened in college when virtually anything handed .

in is passed not because it is actually college-level
work, but, rather, simply because’ it is handed in.
If a person is to improve his mind in college, then
the college must necessarily be demanding. It must
require that students come up to legitimate academic
standards, rather than adjust itself—as it is now
doing—to the level of the students. No instructor
could amble out to the football field and say, ‘ ‘Coach,
l'd sure like to make the squad. Trouble is, I’m slow,

weak, and overweight—think your guys could ease '

up a little when they hit me and let me score a
touchdown once in a while?" And yet, because
college has become reasonably easy, this is precisely
what students have been led to expect—that if
something'is” too‘ tough for them, well, we’ll make it
easier. This is why departmental chairmen hear
students complain not that a teacher is incompetent,
but that he is “too difficult," that his standards are
somehow “too high" (though it is seldom if ever
explained in relation to what the standards are too
high).

Unfortunately. improving academic standards
signiﬁcantly probably isn't feasible today for that
grossest of reasons. money. The nation's colleges
and universities are scratching as desperately as the
rest _of us to stay afloat ﬁnancially, so administrators
aren't likely to beam with delight upon those
instructors who do uphold students. For too many
administrators. students are monetary units, and if
they startgetting low grades and quittingpor flunking
out or transferring to easier schools, then the

‘instructors who are "too tough" are thought to be “

matters, it seems, is the financial one—whether the
monetary unit, the student, will be lost.

The trend toward teacher evaluation question-
naires has helped foster insecurity in those
instructors who would like to upgrade standards.
Rodin and Rodin recently found that"‘Students rate
most highly instructors from whom they learn the
least," who also happen to be the instructors who '
tend to grade leniently. Similarly, _last fall Powell
found that teachers “receive much higher
evaluations from students when they are required to
do less work. receive higher grades, ‘and learn
substantially less." He concludes: “If it is true that
students inadvertently give higher ratings to
instructors who require less work and give higher
grades, and those instructors are rewarded for ‘good’
teaching by their departments and the administra-
tion, while more demanding instructor are punished,
then there is pressure for all instructors to behave in
this way...(thus students) are short-changed on the
most important commodity which is supposed to
result from their university experience—learning."

BY GEORGE DULL

Once upon a time, monkeys were
taken from thewild by using the
simplest of traps—their greed. The
hunter would cut a small hole in the
top of a coconut (large enough to
admit the monkey’s paw), drain it

and fill it with boiled rice. The
_monkey, a lover of boiled rice,

@3-

would insert his paw and grab a ,

large handful. As a result, he
would be unable to remove his
hand. Because he was greedy, it
didn’t occur to him to release the
rice and extract his paw. In the
resultant dilemma, Mr. Monkey
got caught and was shipped to the
Highland _Park Zoo.

The monkey is like our City,
County and State bureaucrats.

Once they get their greedy little ,

paws into the taxpayer's purse,
they haven't enough‘ sense to
release the mittful of wealth they
are intent upon extracting. In this
way, pols in the past have been
caught and put on exhibition. The
Watergate gang, including our
envoy to China, shouldn’t have
been sent away in disgrace or to
some cushy jail—they should have
been displayed in stocks through-'
out the land so that the put-upon

taxpayer could have gotten rid of _

spoiled cabbages, eggs and toma-

‘toes, and maybe a rutabaga or two.

\ V‘

Bureaucratic monkeys are al-
ways in the wilds of the apex of the
structure. This area is sometimes

described by the terms council,
commissioners, the administration.
They always describe themselves
as “honest." I listened recently to
County Commissioner Robert

Peirce on The Marie Torre Show,
and Peirce insisted he hadn’t the
remotest idea of how terrible the
situation was in the past adminis-

‘tration of the county commission-

ers. I could only wonder where
Peirce had been for the past several
years. What was he doing during
this period? He certainly has
enough time in the County Court

  Hitchcock Comedy Thriller

DeciIin', Thievin' and Scarin'

BY M. C. PILECKI

The Master has done it again.

For his long awaited 53rd movie,
Alfred Hitchcock has” put aside
charges of old age with a compact
comedy, The Family Plot, and
proven once again he is the premier
film director alive today—or
perhaps ever.

Though set in Southern Califor-
nia, Plot is a neat little comedy in
the British tradition, not unlike
Hitchcock's earlier The Trouble
With Harry. It concerns two rather
different young couples whom the
phenomenom of coincidence (a
theme) has
drawn together.

The first couple is a fake medium
(Barbara Harris) and her accom-
plice-boyfriend (Bruce Dern), an
“actor” earning his living as a
cabdriver. Then there’s the more

1. suave pair, a jewel dealer and his

mistress (William Devane and
Karen Black), who have an
interesting sidelight: They kidnap

” prominent persons. Involved in all

this is a wealthy dowager (Cather-
ine Nesbitt) who feels guilty about

Fran [Karen Black] in blond wig disguise examines the diamond
ransom for the kidnapped shipping magnate in Family Plot.

in illegal

having forced her sister to give up
her illegitimate son and now wants
him to be her heir. A

As expected, Hitchcock plays his
audience in some unexpected
ways, using the audience’s expec-
tations against them. For example,
not until the film is well under way
do the identities of “hero” and
“villain” become established: Is it
the lower class pair of oversexed
con artists or the smooth upper
class kidnapers?

decides to unfold the mystery of the
missing heir, all four have some
place in the audience’s sympathies.

There are several familiar
Hitchcock themes here, such as the
playing on the audience’s not
completely wholesome feelings of
curiousity and fascination for
(principally nonviolent) criminals.

‘Dreambocit Annie’ Wins
Hearts In U.S. Debut

BY TOM WASELESKI

Dreamboat Annie, Heart
Mushroom Records, MRS]5005.

This group’s been around
Canada "since the early ’70s and
makes its American debut with this
dazzling album. The group bills
itself as sisters Ann and Nancy
Wilson with Steve Fossen and
Roger Fisher. . , '

Fven without top billing the girls
musical spectrum goes, Heart is
Ann doing lyrics and vocals, Nancy
writing and playing to Ann’s
words. -

As far as their position in the
musical spectrum goes, in is
pleasantly on the mainstream side
of Renaissance, the Brit_ish rock-
classics quintet. Ann’s vocals are
tougher and more piercing than

those by Renaissance’s Annie
Haslim. and Heart is more a rock
band than simply a classics group
playing for a rock market.

“Magic Man” is a grinding,
blazing rocker featuring a vocalist
as unrelenting as another day’s
Grace Slick, and Roger Fisher gets
in some hefty guitar work in the
middle. Since most of this group's
pieces are five and six minutes
long, practically everyone in the
band gets a chance ‘to shine
somewhere along the way.

The title theme appears three
times on the record, not holding the
album together as’ any sort of
concept record, but rather provid-
ing some relief between the heavier
numbers. The first version of
‘fDreamboat Annie," called “Fan-
tasy Child,” shows off some nice
acoustic guitar work by Nancy, the

Ir - 9 1-‘!

BY MREA CSORBA

Don't look for the explosive
action of Edward Albee’s “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” to be
repeated in his_“The American

Dream.’ ’

Mirroring the sophisticated vio-
lence of modern times, Albee
couches this play’s nightmare in
unsensational drama. But though

I I ‘ the surface action is simple, Albee
- utilizes enough muck from modern

social twistedness to give the play a
frightening sense of solidity.

I Basically the play entails a
couple's uncomfortable squirmings
as nervous twitches of realizations
surface through their fogginess:
the American Dream is failing
them. But as a drowning person,

' who, with frantic floundering

hastens his going under; so too,
Mommy and Daddy (Caryl Opslin-
sky, Chris Blaetz) get even deeper
into their mire. In a far too simplis-
tic recount of the many-level-
ed intertwinings of this play, the
end result is that the two trade in
the only person who still has a
sense of reality about_her—Gran-
,ma—in exchange for a young man
who is a flawless embodiment of
the American Dream.

V “Embodiment” is a most appro-
priate word since h-e—the dream
boy—is all physical, without
substance; all body, without a soul.

Mommy and Daddy seem" im-

lmensely relieved, however, con-

gratulating each other, “Yes
sirfeel This is more like it!” in

’ their conﬁdence the last thorn of
. truth has been removed; and there

  

Grandma [Ramona Fischer] is the
only one that escapes the fog
enveloping the other American
Dream characters.

will be ‘no more cause for their
vague uneasiness. -
The mechanics of the production,
under the direction of Bill Royston,
work well. In 1959, Albee
extracted a shorter, illusionistic
play, “The Sandbox,” from the
realistic comedy (?) of “The
American Dream.” He used the
same basic characters but placed
them in a different situation. In the
Pittsburgh I Lab Theatre (PLT)
production the two are sliced and
sandwiched‘ back together ynder
the “American Dream” title.
The small audience (limited to
30) sits on top of multi-leveled
scaffolds in the middle of the
“stage.” The action of “Sandbox”
takesiplace on one side, then moves
across stage through the audience
for the ‘-‘American Dream” scenes.

 

The play opens on the “Sand-
box" side with poor Grandma
(well-played as a nimble, far-from-
senile dear by Ramona Fischer)
being dragged hand and foot b
Mommy and Daddy. »—

They dump her in a sandbox an
give her a shovel to bury
herself with. Then Mommy and
Daddy retire to their living room to
figet nervously for the “fixer”
(Trish _Begley, the typical commit-
teewoman) to come who will

‘hopefully make amends for their

souring American Dream.

Once again the unusual seating
arrangement contributes to the
impact of what we see. The
proximity of the audience, together
with the darkness of the stage,
makes the viewers seem like silent
ghost-observers of a spotlighted
excorism. 

The play will stay with you for
weeks. The intricacies of Albee’s
works are’ -well-recognized; the
excellent portrayal of his characters
by the PLT company only enhances
the built-in nuances. Only one
slight fai1ing—the American

Dream boy, the epitome _of the'

human social package, falls short of
the glorious god-like image promo-
ted in the script. 'Dean Hyland,
though a superb actor, is a little too
bumpy, and his face shows signs of
difficult times, rather than A the
pudgy softness of the boy of slick
magazine pages. .

The play continues through May
23, Thursday through Sunday, 8:30
p.m. at the Pittsburgh -Lab'Theatre
on the corner of Craft and Fifth
Ave. .-

Hitchcock movie are usually dull at
best. while members of the police
force are definitely unappealing.

Another, even more familiar
theme is that of the fragility of
personal identity, with new twists.
Thistime the primary identity in
question is that of the “villain’s"
(who actually sports a moustache-
a first for Hitchcock; he has often
played upon the old melodramatic
notion that the villain always has a
moustache).

The “heroine” keeps two identi-
ties—one of them 'male—for her
work, and keeps its genuineness as
cloudy as possible. In a smaller
way, the “hero” keeps switching
identities, too, for his work.

Hitchcock plays the suspense-
for which he has become deser-
vedly famous—in different ways.
Much of his suspense in _Plot is not
related to fear, but rather, more to
curiousity. Is Devane really the
missing heir? Will Dern and ‘Harris
find him to-tell: him that he's so
wealthy he doesn’t need to kidnap?

When Hitchcock ﬁnally does get
around to scaring the audience, he
mixes it thoroughly with slapstick
(at the base of which is, after all,
fear) in a scene that is a gem. The
old car-without-brakes-going-down
-the-steep-mountain-road bit has
been done many times, but not as
funny as in Family Plot. Hitchcock

keeps the camera inside the car for
the most part. emphasizing the
comic aspects of Harris’ complaints
and Dern’s look of helplessness,
rather than dwelling on the “thrill”
of the car’s speed or the view from
the cliffs. _

There's also a bit of an inside
joke. Hitchcock has been famous
for his “cool blondes,,”, but this
time his “icy blonde” is a
wig——that gets stuffed in

the. .

refrigerator after use. “E

And then there’s the greatest F
suspense of all: When is Number
54?

Tubes In Concert Mondciyil

Anyone in need of some musical
and theatrical insanity should‘
check out the Tubes. A

The Tubes have been generating
waves and building a cult-following
on the West Coast with its bizarre
stage show and satirical music for
the past three years. The group is
comprised of 24 people with
various backgrounds; ex-models,
college dropouts, mimes, a Holly-
wood stuntman, musicians and
dancers, with one common bond
—craziness.

It’s new album, Young and Rich,
is an extension of the looniness
found on the first Tubes album,
and to give you an idea of what to
expect, here are some of the titles:
‘fPimp,” “Don’t Touch Me
There,” “I’m Pround to- be an

' American" and the title cut, “Rich

and Young.” Included also is

_ heavy-metal rendition of “Love

And because the keycodes of all prefixed
functions 'are merged, the 49—step program
memory can actually store up to 147 key—
strokes. (Hows that for a memory capacity!)
Whats more, you can store numberslin eight
data registers and perform 72 preprogrammed
functions and operations (logs, trig, mean
deviations, rectangulanpolar conversions,
summations —you name it). Not to mention
RPN logic; fixed decimal, scientific and
engineering notation; and much, much more.

In fact, if you wanted to know all the
HP—25 can do for you it would take a book.
But don’t worry, we've already written one —

Some of the tracksters in the
{ nation will be invading Pitt

"Stadium tomorrow and Saturday

‘defer’ the Sixth Annual Pitt Invitation-
‘_al, in what many feel will be the

 best track meet ever held in the city

A of Pittsburgh. V
Though -V the names may be
obscure, the qualifications are
formidable.
;One participant, Villanova’s

‘S 6“ Eamonn Coghlan, has run a 3:53
4’ V mile and, at last year’s Invitational,

became the first person to run in a
sub-four-minute mile (3:56.2).

 . Cochlan, who may represent his

home country of Ireland n this
_-year’s Olympics, also holds the
,_meet record for the 3-mile run
:_(13:35.0). He has also run a 1:49
half-mile.
The half-mile standard will be
challenged by two of his Villanova

 teammates, Ed Tackacs (who has

"run a 1:47) and Mark Belger, both
Olympic candidates, and also by

‘~Mark Robinson, from Catholic

 One More

University, who holds the Invita-
tional record in the event (1 :49) and
Seton Hall’s Orlando Green (1:46
his best).

The 100- and 220-yard dashes
look to be don’t-blink-or-you’ll-
miss-’em events, with East Caro-
lina speedster Carter Suggs -(for-
mer national high, school record
holder in the 100 with a 9.3) and
teammate Larry Austin (22.1 in the
220) set to battle it out. p

Seton Hall and East Carolina also
appear to be the favorites in the
440-yard relay. '

The American record-holder in
the 1,000-yard run indoors, Tom
Byers, representing Ohio State,
will also be on hand. 1

Other entrants include Penn
State's George Malley, holder of
the third fastest steeplechase time
in the country this year (8:34) and
his Nittany Lion teammate, Mike
Shine, who has turned in times of

.l3.6 in the 120-yard high hurdles,

49.9 in the 440-yard intermediate
hurdles and 45.8 in a leg ofthe mile
relay. Shine is one of the top ﬁve
hurdlers in the country.

“Knight”

To Remember

BY TOM HALL /
' Sports Editor

,When Bill Knight graduated, from Pitt in 1974 and signed a contract
with the American Basketball Association's Indiana Pacers, I figured
I'd never get the opportunity to watch the ﬂashiest player Pitt has ever

" known do one of his back-door over-the-head lay-ups again.

But a guy named Mike Malloy and the Big Brothers Association of

Allegheny County has given me new hope.

On June 12, the

organization will sponsor a basketball game or two as a fund raising

I "effort, with some of the most interesting lineups I've ever seen.

In the ﬁrst game, a team comprised of former Pitt and Duquesne

Steelers.

0 - players who graduated before 1967 will face a team from the Pittsburgh

“I can't say for certain that the ofﬁcial Steeler basketball team will
be able to attend,” said Malloy. “I have talked with Franco Harris,
who is very active in the Big Brothers program in Pittsburgh, and he

I _ promised me he’ll get enough Steelers together to field a team.”

The second contest will feature a rematch of the old feud that has fed
the fires of collegiate basketballin the city since way back when. Pitt
will field a team to face Duquesne, with both squads composed of

 - post-'67 grads. The Panthers will he coached by ex-mentor Charles

“Biiza” Ridl, while the Dukes will have the services of Red Manning,
back at the helm since his retirement from the coaching ranks three

years ago.

Pitt’s squad will feature the likes of Mike Paul, Mickey Martin'and

Tom Richards.

The Dukes will counter with Jarrett “The Jewel”

Durham, Gary and Barry Nelson and other faces from the past.

But what about Billy Knight?

It seems there is a clause in the standard professional basketball
contract that precludes a player from participating in contests that '7

include amateur participants.

But Mike Malloy has come up with a solution. “During the halftime
of the Pitt-Duquesne game we'll stage a two-on-two match,” he said.
That match will feature two ex-Dukes, Mickey Davis of the Milwaukee
Bucks and Mike Barr of the Virginia Squires, pitted against ex-Panther
stars Mel Bennett, also of the Squires, and Knight.

It should be an interesting night of basketball, and to top it off a
women’s gymnastic team from Penn Hall Academy will be performing.

“I'm looking forward to a sell-out crowd,” said Malloy. “It should
be a great time for everyone, and well worth the $2.50 admission.”

The event is scheduled to take place in Allegheny Community
College's Allegheny Campus gym. The facility seats only 1,500 fans,
so get your tickets early. If $2.50 seemsva bit steep for a basketball

” game, remember, it's for a good cause.

Recruit to HelpNetters

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

Pitt’s basketball program has
been grabbing a lot of hot
prospects for the 1976-77 season,
and now another Panther team has
come up with a star recruit of its
own. ‘

Tom Liebenguth, a North Alle-
gheny High senior and one of the
top scholastic tennis players in the
state, has signed a letter of intent
to enter Pitt next fall, thus giving
Coach George Dieffenbach’s hopes
for success a considerable boost.

Liebenguth, born in England, is
also ranked ninth by the Middle
States Tennis Association (MSTA)
which spans Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Delaware and New
Jersey. He has yet to lose a dual
match and is a top contender for
state championship
after being last year's runnerup.

Besides his four letters in tennis,
Liebenguth has also won three
letters in soccer while acting as
North Allegheny’s co-captain and
earning two All-WPIAL selections.
The 6-0, 165 netter will be a great
asset to Dieffenbach’s program.

“I am thrilled to be able to add a
player of Tom's . caliber to our

aspiring tennis program,” Dieffen-
bach said. “Not only is he a ﬁne
tennis‘ player, but he’s a bright
young'man who isinterested in
both academics and athletics.

“There’s great possibilities for
him at Pitt for national exposure
and a chance to advance his. game
with an advancing program.”

' Meanwhile, the Pitt tennis team
has finished its current season,
ending with a 5-7 mark. Despite
being walloped, 9-0, by Penn State,

the Panthers were able to rebound ‘

and win three of their last four
matches—5-4 over West Liberty,
7-2 over Carnegie-Mellon and 8-1
over Westminster.

“I'm not really happy," Dieffen-
bach said, “but I’m not discour-
aged. We did not have
overabundance of talent, but we
were a fairly young squad.
Considering our schedule and the
exams the kids were taking, we did
quite well."

Dieffenbach’s biggest disap-
pointment came in the doubles
competition. Several times during
the season, his Panthers were tied
with or leading an opponent, only
to lose the overall match due to
weak doubles squads.

“We were equal man for man
with every team outside of Penn

an"

State, but our doubles really hurt
us,” he said.

Against Allegheny, Pitt was
leading, 4-2, ‘going into the
doubles, only to drop three straight
sets and the match, 5-4. then,

' against Akron, the Panthers pulled

the same stunt, this time losing two
of three sets in a match knotted at
3-3 after singles. Dieffenbach
regards the collapse against
Allegheny the most disappo‘inting(

moment of his initial season as--‘H’:—'

coach. A

“With a little more depth, and
we'll work on doubles, next season,
we should be vastly improved,” he

said. ‘

Dieffenbach singled out Harry
Habbel as his best and most
improved player of the past season.

“He wanted to win. He really
fought hard in all his matches.”
Habbel ﬁnished with an 8-3 record,
while his brother, Mike, recorded a
7-5 slate.

With only two players graduat-
ing and all singles starters
returning, Dieffenbach is optimis-
tic _but still somewhat apprehensive

about his team's chances for next .
season. In addition to Liebenguth, ‘,

he has gained another top prospect
in Philadelphian Kevin Quay, who
is also ranked high by‘ the MSTA.

“Both of these players should
add strength, depth and a lot of
talent to our team," Dieffenbach
said.

With six returnees and at least
two talented freshman seeking
positions for the fall season,
Dieffenbach feels intra-team com-
petition will help as the Panthers
face another formidableschedule.

“That's a big factor," he said.

the coach is good. There's going to
