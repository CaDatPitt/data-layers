Campus Balloting  
Favors Negative
In Inﬂation Poll

Preliminary Count Reveals Trend
Of University Opinion; News
‘ Solicits More Comment

The trend of opinion on the campus
regarding currency inﬂation is rather
deﬁnitely negative. Thus. show pre-
limi.nary tabulations of ballots cast in
the poll which is under the sponsor-

ship of The Pitt News, the American

Institute of Public Opinion, and The
‘Pittsburgh Press. '

A News reporter -sought comments
Monday from faculty and students
personally, and those gathered con-
ﬁrm the verdict of the ballots.

Dr. Charles -S. Tippetts, deanof the
School of Business Administration,
said that he was opposed to currency
"inﬂation. “When someone talks‘; of
inﬂation to me, I take it he means
inﬂation by ' the issuance of green-
backs. The diﬂiculty in this is that
once you get the‘ printing press start-
‘ed it is hard to stop. This brings,
about a rapid rise in prices, and, this
condition is dangerous. The experi-
ence .of the world in the past in re-
gard‘ to inﬂation has been unfortun-
ate.”» Credit inﬂation in Dr. Tippetts’-
isn’t as dangerous as the
greenback type of inflation, especial-
ly if the inﬂation is regulated by some
such body as the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem. ‘

A student when questioned claimed
that he was opposed to inﬂation if it
was “used as a means of paying the
debts of the United States ‘govern-
ment. Increased inheritance and in-
come taxes will adequately take care
of the tax burden."

In the opinion of Dr. Francis D.
Tyson, professor of economics, cur-
rency inﬂation isn’t really necessary
because, “There is enough currency
already in circulation. The real prob-
lem is to guard against credit inﬂa-
tion, due to the excess of bank re-
serves- The expansion
should keep pace with the expansion
of goods and services.” T .

There were some humorous com-
' One young
lady "when questioned said that she

was against 

she was .“a. capitalist.” _
According to one student “inﬂation
isjthe only way thatlyou can equalize
the government. expenditures.” _
All students who have not votedin
this poll are urged to do so at once.
There are ballot boxes in Alumni Hall,
Thaw Hall, State Hall, and Cathedral.

, There are two boxes in the Cathedral,

in" theﬁrst floor lobby and outside
Room 801.

The results of the campus poll will
be published in next Monday's issue
of The Pitt News.

- A yurs iUncovers Possible Loophole
In Planned Surplus Tax Legislation  

By_ Daniel Lichtenstein

Robert D. Ayars, professor and head
of the department of accounting, who
has spend a great deal of "time study-
ing tax accounting, has observed a
possible loophole in the Surplus‘ Tax
bill which is still in its embryonic
stage in the Senate committee.

After reading on the potentialities
of the president’s proposed legislation
placing a ‘tax on corporation sur-
pluses,’ Mr. Ayars feels reasonably
sure that one large loophole has been
overlooked up to date by the presi-
dent and by the press.

The main purpose of this proposed
tax bill is to attack the "large sur-
pluses of corporations,,_thus forcing
these corporations to reduce their sur
plus-by declaring .nLio1_-e and larger
cash dividends. This Woiﬂd put more
money into circulation, increasing the
buying power of the community and
creating general prosperity.

Because stock dividends, which re-
duce surplus just as well "as cash
dividends, are taxfree, the ’-corpora-
tions will resort to declaring them in-
stead. Although this reduces the tax-
able surplus it does not affect the net
Worth of the corporation.

This is easily demonstrated by a
simple illustration. Suppose that-‘a
corporation _has $100,000 in outstand-
ing capital stock, and a surplus-_of_
$80,000, thus giving it.‘-a net worth. of-
$180,000. Suppose further that there‘,
are 1,000 shares of stock outstanding.
Dividing the number of shares into the,
net worth we ﬁnd that each share has
a book value of $180. The corpora-
tion not wanting to pay the surplus
tax and not wanting to pay out cash
dividends, issues a stock dividend of
60 per cent, if its charter permits the
further issuance of. stock. Taking the
60 percent stock dividend on the cap-

stop all payments diii'ing--,t_.depres§'

tal capital stock outstanding after the
stock dividend is declared will be
$160,000.  _ _ i i , . -
Returning to the old surplus, it has
been 1'educ.ed by $60,000 leaving $20,-
000 and leaving that net worth at the
original total of‘_$180,000. It can’ be
seen that although not one cent has
been taken: out ofthe corporation the
taxable surplus has been “reduced by
the issuance of this untaxable stock
dividend. ' _  ' _
On the other,h[and_,_fassuming that
the stock distributed‘;-i's_-‘of ~su-bstantial-
ly the same -char. cter a.Ix_d~pI:efer’ence,

Psychology Group
J Hears R0ot’s Talk‘

Graduate School Head Discusses
Viewpoints Of Psychologists .

Stressing the point that emotion
obscures the means by which we ar-
rive at our’ beliefs, Dr. W. T_ Root,
dean of the Graduate School and head
_of the department oi-psychology, dis-
‘cussed the psycholog'ist’s viewpoint of
reasoning before the Psychology
Forum on Monday evening.
“The psychologist,” Dr. Root stated,
“is interested in what- is believed and
‘whythe particular individual in ques-
tion believes it. From his standpoint,
a perfectly erroneous belief held by
the individual is just as important as
an absolute fact.”
. “The crater and demagogues, arous-
ing our emotions, employ, the ‘Aristo-
telian fallacies’ to shape our beliefs.
But‘ the psychologist is interested in
unconscious use of these errors in
logic by the general public,” said the
speaker. _ I
He listed the “fallacies" as: amphi-
boly, which is ambiguity; composi-
tion, assuming something that is true
for the whole, to be true for the in-

dividual; division, the ‘opposite of
composition; accent, that is, over-
emphasis in -reading, to demonstrate
the reader's point: accident. treating
accident as essential; “begging the
question," assuming the conclusion
to be proved and making it part of
the proof; and false assumpt:lon.
‘ “-Belieif,”ihe said, "is a passive ac-

ceptance of the reports of our consci- *

ousness. Doubt is dynamic; it is sus-
pension of judgment; it is great emo-
tional stress."

,Dr. G: E. Jones, professor of psy-
chology, presided at the Fo':um.

,.'E’e1se'1‘:.‘8pa.rkle For Plaid-

.  A band of wily Scotchmen, using all
their cunning in protecting a small

investment compounded in the last -

period, kept the Panthercagers away
.-z from their door, and-that tells how

 the Pitt ﬂoormen lost the Eastern In;-

tercollegiate basketball title’ at the
Stadium Monday evening. _When all
the shooting was over, and there was
plenty of ‘it, the ‘scoreboard showed
32 for Carnegie, 27 for Pitt.

A Coach Max Hannum’s boys, by dint

- of some ﬁne defensive play on the '

part of Lou Jagnow andvslim James,
hold the Panthers to seven marl’ rs
in th.e.last period. During that I. _e
the Plaid bagpiped 13 points to,over-
come a slim Pitt lead and hoist the
Tartan banner atop the Eastern Con-
ference for the first time since the
league was formed. ._ __ -

It was all Pitt during the greater
part of the ﬁrst_ period, the Carlson-
men holdinga 17-7 lead at one.point
in the struggle. The injection of Lou

' Jagnow into‘ the tilt helped the Tech

cause a lot‘, for he immediately boost-
ed_ his team stock ﬁve points to 17-12.
Patt’s ﬁeld goal deadlocked -hostili-
.ties ‘at 19-all,‘but Bob Johnson sank a
penalty shot togive the Carlsonmen a
20-19 margin at. halftime. ,
' Felser and Jagnow brought the Tar-
tan total up to 25 within the ﬁ'rst few
‘minutes of play’ in the second half,
and from there on down the home‘
stretch, the boys from.across the Hol-

K ‘ low, hung onto their lead with. the
tenacity _of the proverbial Scotchman -

clutching _a penny. The score went
25-22‘, 27-24, 28-26, 29-27, and ﬁnally
32-27. '

For Carnegie, Jagnow and Felser
led_the scoring, each lad getting nine
points, ‘but the work of James, Tech
center, was exceptionally ﬁne. Time
and time again the lanky Tartan stop-

f ped, Pitt shots from getting near ‘the

Program After
Evaluation Today

Committees Study Work, Propose
Revisions For Coming "Year;
To Hear Finance Report

Members of the campus YW will

give their program a thorough over-
hauling and reconditioning this after-
noon and evening. The occasion is
the annual Evaluation Conference,
when group members study the as-
sociation program in an objective
manner.
During the past week, each YVV
committee met and reviewed the com-
mittee work-. Each considered such
questions as what work of value had
been done, and what work was not
of value; how the committee had ad-
vanced the main purposes of the or-
ganization; how the committee might
next year more clearly express the
purpose of the YW; suggestions for
more ﬂexibility in committee set-up;
and Speciﬁc problems to be considered
at Leaders’ Institute.

These same questions will be'sum—
marized by Jane Kahler, Ed37, im-
mediately following a brief opening
worship service led by Sara Marie

noon in the Y Club Rooms on Bouquet
Street. A considerable amount of dis-
cussion on the ﬁndings of committees
is expected. ,

Miss Rachel Timberlake, regional
secretary of the Student Christian
Movement, will be guest speaker at
the dinner to be served at 6 o’clock.
She will lead the evening discussion
period as well. ‘

Following a report on future ﬁnance
and general policy, submitted by Mrs.
W. W. Mendenhall, a memberof the
advisory board, the conference will
consider several main questions that
will arise out of the afternoon discus-
sion. Chief among these will be a
consideration of cooperation and joint
projects with the YMCA, the prob-
lem of becoming more vocal about
group convictions, committee organ-
ization, and program simpliﬁcation.

In conclusion, Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women, who is a mem-

review the work of the freshman re-
ligious program, which has centered
about a consideration of “Spiritual
Poise.” All members of the advisory
board have been invited to the con-
ference.

Doctor Edward‘ Grace is a kindly,

elderly fman, very nervous; When he
reveals a strong motive for killing
Robinson, and even admits he plan-
ned to shoot him, only didn't, because
something which happened that eve-
ning made iﬁsunnecessary, everyone is
astonished. The last part of his story
seems unlikely.
' His reason for wishing: to do {Robin-
son an injury had to do with the hon-
or of Carlotta, his niece, who had ,a
mind and will of her own, and could
not be prevailed on to listen to rea-
son. Robert McKee, _C38, will take
the part of Doctor Grace.

Alice Montgomery, a buxom,‘ elder-

ly lady and chai1_"man‘of the amateur
players, is ‘somewhat silly, ‘although
in a very nice way, like many elderly
women active in community life. Mrs.
Montgomery will be played by ‘-Helen
Ackerman, C38.
_ Maria Scott, assistant to Director
McAuliffe, is the efficient young
spinster type.‘ The lady.is remarka-
ble for her detection of insigniﬁcant
detai1s., She leads the way in solv-
ing the crime. Jeannette Swartz, C38,
will play the role. -

Helen Maxwell, a middle-aged
widow, is the mother of Carlotta. She
is considerably worried over Carlot-
ta’s infatuation with the villain, Rob-
inson, so she too might wish his re-
moval. Ola McGrail, C36, will be Mrs.
Maxwell. ,
