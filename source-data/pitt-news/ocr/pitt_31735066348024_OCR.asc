Frat Noise Aggravates

Bellefield Area Residents

BY DON CRONER

"Reports circulating the college
community of an impending battle
between students and’ permanent
residents in the Bellefield area
appear to be for the most part
ungrounded. The residents were
reportedly up-in-arms over late
night partying. juicing, and ca-
rousing in the streets, a situation
severely aggravated byithe Fall
rush of the fraternities which offer
a good part of the student housing
in the area.

“It happens every year at this

.time,’.’ said William Markus,
Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs. “This has been a
problem for the last 15 years. It

[7 corresponds with the weather--

every fall and every spring, when

people can be outdoors, the
situation is always a little aggra-
vated." '

The Inter—Fraternity Council, it-
self aware that the situation was a
little aggravated, scheduled a

meeting inpart to discuss the“

problem. A spokesman for the
Council said they were also aware
. that Bellefield residents had sought

police advice in the matter.

The Bellefield Area Civic Asso-
ciation (BACA) did in fact can in a
police officer, himself a Bellefield
resident, to discuss particularly the
problem of noise between dusk
and dawn. The police officer
offered little solace to his fellow
residents: “There's little that can
be done about the noise. It's
simply a problem of having literally
hundreds of students in the streets
on some of your busier nights.
They really aren't doing anything
illegal and can't be arrested, but by
sheer numbers they make a lot of
noise."

Sister Viola Leininger, president
of the Bellefield Area Civic
Association is the vocal point of

what protest has been aroused in

the area. “Numerous people have
spoken to me about the noise
around, the fraternities and parti-
cularly around Haddon Hall. There
is no lounge in the building, and
when the place closes at two the
people are very noisy. It is mainly
older people who have complained

Lewis’ Son Stumps for Father

BY BOB EVANS

Making state scholarship funds
available to middle income families
will be an aim of GOP guberna-

candidate Drew Lewis if
, according to his son.
who ~made a campaign

3Lewis, 19, a sophomore at
Haverford College, spent the
tlmmer, traveling across the state
_ncouraging young people “to take
 interest in politics, and, if they
like what they see and hear of Drew
Lewis, to help campaign for him.”
‘My father believe many institu-
tions for higher learning have
become accessible only to the
disadvantaged and the rich."
Lewis said, "The middle income
amilies are being pressed harder
and harder to meet rising education
costs, because their income is
above the cut-off line for scholar-
ship, but not -fully sufficient to
finance a college education.
"/‘The middle income families, in
addition to the full tuition costs,
must also bear the ﬁnancial burden

, ilies could become eligible for
scholarships if cut-off ﬁgures were

‘One of my father’s proposals is if
he maximum family income ﬁgure
allowable for scholarships were
raised from $12,000 or $20,000, we
could give these middle income

- highways, as

people some needed ﬁnancial
relief." ‘

Lewis also said his father believes
mass transportation is another
program which can certainly work
efficiently if it is properly funded.

“Transportation money is being
handled poorly in Pennsylvania,
and is definitely a source of waste
in the state government. A system
of submitting bids for state jobs, a
system my father approves of,
would eliminate this waste.”

Lewis said his father believes
decentralization of government
would help improve transportation
problems.

“Government has become too
centralized." Lewis said. “My
father wishes to bring it back to the
local level. the grassroots level.

“By bringing issues such as
transportation to these local levels
and granting them subsidies, my
father hopes we will elminate the
poor condition of the state’s
well as cutting
wasteful spending in transporta-
tion."

Lewis felt the greatest effect
Watergate had on the people is this
resulting apathy toward politics.

“The people have/become really
turned off by politics, but their
faith can be restored through
honesty and openness. . .

“My father can restore a positive
attitude in the people,” he said.
“His complete financial and
income tax disclosures and his
openness with the press are good

examples of what kind of man he
is.”

“My father challenged Shapp to
four debates on statewide televi-
sion so the people could evaluate
the two. My father feels this is
highly significant, because the
people deserve this
evaluate their candidates.’

Despite the many negative as-
pects of Watergate. Lewis said
there definitely was a bright side to
the problem. .

“There’s been a positive fallout,
as more and more new people are
becoming involved in government.
And, especially among young
people, there’s great potential.

“Young people between the ages
of 18 and 25 could have a big say in
the direction the Pennsylvania
state government goes. But we
have to get mobilized and vote."

At :1 meeting of the Board of

Directors of the BACA this past
Wednesday night. Leininger

brought up the subject of student-
permanent resident relations. One
man. in his 60's, agreed that the
students were noisy, but differed
from Markus, as to when they were
the worst: "It's not so bad now,
but when the weather gets colder
and people are out having snowball
fights and sledriding--that's when
things really get noisy. But there's
not that much serious trouble.

There's just so many of them and
they seem to stay out all night long.

They seem to be having a good
time."

Another member of the Board. a
student and a member of a
fraternity himself, offered a de-“
fense. “Fraternity people are
usually pretty stable. They have a
high over-all grade average. They
aren't the kind of people who cause
a lot of serious trouble." Later he
added, “Besides, the fraternities
were there first." '

to make a more substantial protest,

demurred. The board passed a

Igrlorance and Deceitin S(}

"' - BY TOM SMITH

Editors Note:i [This is the second in
a series of articles on the Student
Government Allocations Commit-
tee]: .

Funding recommendations of the
Allocations Committee to the
Student Government Board for the
Black Action Society (BAS) and the
Pitt Young Socialist Alliance (YSA)
are examples of the committee
members’ unwillingness and ina-
bility to properly administer their
‘obs. _ »

After conducting interviews with

representatives of the -BAS last

spring the Allocations Committee
recommended a reduction in their
programming schedule.’
scheduled three
political speakers to address
dnterested Pitt students this year.
The Allocations Committee decided
'in their apparently infinite wisdom
that this was an excessive number
‘of political speakers and eliminated
one from the BAS budget request.
By making such a recommenda-
tion the committee completely
disregarded the programming re-
cord of the BAS, which has
included in the past year such
speakers as Bobby Scale and
Stokely Carmichael. ~Clearly, the
BAS has sponsored some of the
most distinguished, thoughtful.
and successful programming atPitt
in recent years. .
And yet, a BAS program featuring
Angela Davis, one more attempt by
the organization to continue servi-
cing the campus community
intellectually was eliminated by the
Allocations Committee. According

to the committee Davis was no‘

longer capable ,of drawing an
audience sufficient to justify an
expenditure of funds.

Obviously, the committee ne-
glected to research. their claim
adequately,- since only a few
months after the committee’s
recommendation Davis attracted

. many thousands of people to a rally

in North Carolina protesting racism
and political, oppression in that

 
 

state.

The program featuring Davis was
eventually restored after more
‘information sessions with the
committee, but too late to prevent a
confrontation at a Student Govern-
ment Board meeting. The
committee had rectified its mis-
take, but only after it was
responsible for provoking a con-
frontation which should never have
occurred.

Unlike BAS, in, which the
allocations recommendation was
bred from ignorance the recom-
mendation denying all funds for

programming to the Pitt Young,

Socialist Alliance was a blatantly
vindictive attempt to deceive that
organization and the Student
Government Board. H

The committee stated three
reasons for objecting to a proposed
YSA conference on the relationship
between socialism and“the. struggle
for Black Liberation.

First, the Allocations Committee
said the proposed conference
duplicated the efforts of the BAS to
program black speakers. However,
simply because an organization
other than BAS seeks to sponsor
political programs featuring black
sponsors, it cannot be said that
those efforts either duplicate or

‘overlap the jurisdiction of the BAS. 

A program on black socialism is

most definitedly within the scope of i

the programming interest of the
YSA just as one on blacks in the
military could be presented by one
of Pitt’s military affiliated student
organizations. ‘
Secondly, the committee stated
the proposed dates for the
conference conflicted with Parent’s.
Weekend. Though it is the policy
of Student Government ‘not to
schedule events for a specific date,
this only applies to programs
sponsored either. by Student
Government or other student
organizations. Parents’ Weekend
is sponsored by the University and
not by Student Government, which
indicates that if the Committee
desired to approve the YSA
program it-could have done without

- ployed extremely

worrying about Parents’ Weekend
programming restrictions.

And finaly, the Allocations Com.-
mittee questioned the organiza-
tional capacity of the YSA to
sponsor campus programs. This is
the most outrageous claim of all
since the YSA has already proven
its ability to program despite its
very brief one year tenure as an
active campus organization.

Not only did the YSA field a slate

[of candidates for the last Student

Government Elections, the organi-
zation also successfully sponsored
last March a socialist educational
conference featuring black socialist
Andrew Pulley, a former vice-
prcsidential candidate.

The Allocations Committee em-
general and
blank terms such as duplication,
schedule conflicts, and program-
ming capacity in the case involving
the’ YSA without detailing specific
instances of duplication, student
sponsored programming conflicts,
or organizationalprogramming
incapacity, , if .

However, the true motivation for
the committee, members’ decision
to deny funds to the Pitt YSA was
never formally communicated to
either the organization or the
Student Government Board.

Members of the Allocations-

Committee, themselves, have ad-
mitted‘ they objected to the
programming of Pulley on the basis
that he spoke at the Pittsburgh
YSA headquarters on Bouquet
Street in addition_to speaking on
campus to, _P1tt stifdents.

Yet this has never been publicly

- explained’ by the committee.

And after temporarily punishing
the YSA for\.their supposed
programming infraction, the A110-
cations Committee approved over
the summer a funding request for a
program featuring Linda Jenness.
The committee obviously found this
program entitled‘.“The Socialist
Alternative for America” much
more acceptable that the initially
requested program dealing with

‘ blacks andithe labor struggle.

Arab Oil Prices Prompt
Washington Tough To/l<

BY KENNETH J. FREED
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON AP -

The United States has little in the
way of hard weaponry to back up
the Ford administration’s tough
talk concerning a new oil crisis.

President Ford, Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger and Treasury
Secretary William E. Simon in the
past week have warned of a
disastrous international economic
disruption if the price of Arab oil is
not lowered.

Ford and Kissinger, particularly,
indicated the Western industrial-
ized nations would not sit placidly
by while the oil producers accumu-
lated more and more of their
currency.

Administration sources have out-
lined several possibilities under
consideration for meeting the oil
threat, ranging from diplomatic
isolationof the Arab states to a
last-resort use of military force.

But an analysis of projected
remedies and discussions with
administration and diplomatic
sources indicate the US strategy
most likely to be followed is a very
complicated, long-range solution
that requires nearly unprecedented
international cooperation.

The first step was started last
week in Brussels, when 12 nations
agreed tentatively on a coordinated
plan to reduce their oil demand in
the event of a new crisis while
sharing the available supply.

The next stage may come this
weekend with a reported meeting
Kissinger and Simon will hold at
Camp David with the foreign and
finance ministers of Japan, Great
Britain, West Germany and
France.

Kissinger is said to have arranged

 

Call 6'21-0500

the meeting in secrecy for a
detailed study of ways to offset the
Arabs’ economic power and en-
courage a common front.

The theory is that if all the big oil
users out their demand, the Arabs

Governor Milton Shapp will ap-
point a new student member to the
Board-of Trustees to replace Shar-
on Novak whose 3 year term
expires November 17, according to
Student Activities Director .Dan
Meloro.

Meloro said his office had already
forwarded A the names of three
nominees, one from each of Pitt’s

'74 Homecoming Activities

(Continued from Page I)

and the committee agreed, Tive
said. i

The requirements and procedures
for this year’s contest will be the
same as in previous years, accord-
ing to Tive.

He said he believed “the majority
of the University community would
support the idea of a Queen over a
Homecoming Person."

This year's Homecoming program
is tenatively scheduled to begin
Wednesday, October 6, with a
proposed campus variety show.
The show, if it is held, will be the
first variety show presented in
conjunction with Homecoming. It
will be free to the public and any
student or student group will be
eligible to perform.

Thursday, October 7, will be
highlighted by’ the annual Campus
Leadership Dinner held by the Pitt
Alumni Association followed by
free films in David Lawrence Hall.
No definite film titles have yet been
named. ’

The Homecoming Parade will be
held Friday afternoon with sepa-
rate competitions for ﬂoats and
banners. Preliminaries in the keg-
rolling competition will follow the
parade.

Friday evening will begin with the
usual bonfire rally followed by a
concert. No groups have been
decided on for the Friday night
concert. V

Finals in keg-rolling will be held

Temple Homecoming game. The
traditional Homecoming Dance will
be held Saturday night at a location
to be decided later.

Also being considered is a window
painting competition to be held
earlier in the week in the Towers
Lobby. .

The theme for this year's Home-
coming is “Campus Kaleido-
scope," according to Homecoming
Committee Chairperson Janet
Toth. “A kaleidoscope has many
different parts, but in the end it all
comes together to form one pat-
tern. Likewise, we are trying to
bring together the different
groups, schools, and students
within the University," Toth said.

student governing bodies, to the
governor for his selection. The
three are: Shiela Rae Rathke,
recommended by General Studies
Student Cabinet (GSSC), Lynn
George Kissel, recommended by
the Graduate and Professional
Students Association (GPSA), and
Haig Sakoian, recommended by
Pitt undergraduate Student Go-
vernment (SG).

The Board of Trustees is at the top
of Pitt's organizational structure
and consists of 36 unsalaried voting
nembers, the Governor, the State
Secretary of Education, and The
Mayor of Pittsburgh. It is ‘respon-
sible for the overall direction of the
University, managing funds and
assuring University compliance
with public interest.

Provisions for a student member
to the Board came in 1971 when
Shapp decided that “young people
will provide the Board of Trustees
with input and viewpoints which
are often ignored or overlooked.
Besides appointing Novak to Pitt’s
Board. Shapp named trustees to
the boards of Penn State and
Temple.

1 “Shapp appointed the student
members in 1971 in the middle of a
lot of student interest in the
workings of the University and a lot

of campus unrest,” Meloro said.

“We wrote to the Governor
during the summer to see if it was
his intention to continue with a
student member, he said ‘yes’ so
we asked the three student govern-
ing bodies to submit one name
each.”

Meloro said he wasn't sure exact-
ly when Shapp would make his
appointment, but felt he would

decide before November 17, when .

Novak leaves office.

COLLEGE YOUNG 

‘ offers students “political re-lease.” photo by Wilson

“You have to work with the
system to change the system,” said
State College Young Democrats
(CYD) President Bet Nelson, also
an active member of the Pitt CYD.
“People have to become involved
‘to make sure corruption is cut to a
minimum.” 4 ,

“People should register .to vote,
know the issues, and get invol-
ved,” Nelson said. “People have
to demand politicians be respon
sive to them.”\ --

The CYD,» Nelson said, sets up
‘ programs of political education as
well as studying and critiquing of
issues such as education bills,
juvenile penal reform, and election
' reform. E _

. CYD President John Rohe said
' CYD offers the student a “political
release. We can funnel him to the
proper channels. ” The CYD offers’

YOUNG AMERICANS
FOR FREEDOM

“Nothing is»the peop1e’s fault.
Professional politicians and bur-
eaucrats are too caught up in the
growing government thing.”
Mitch Kaufman spoke of the
central philosophy of the Pitt
Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF). ’

“Our organization is speciﬁcally
for people blaming our government
for ourrproblems,” member Rich-
ard Meritzer said. “We want
freedom from government ‘control,
from manipulation. We support
the right of free speech‘ and
freedom of the individual on issues
like abortion.”

Last year the YAF successfully
led a petition campaign against an

‘anti-hitchhiking bill. In the past

they have sponsored seminars on
the at1'ocities_of North and South
Vietnam and the dangers they feel
are inherent inincreased diploIm-
tic relations with Red China.

Meritzer said the Pitt YAF is,

different from the national YAF.
“We use a more radical liber-
tarian stand,” he said. The Pitt
chapter disagrees with the state
and national organizations on many
issues;
Meritzer said the national organi-

zation is “very conservative” ‘and,

for this reason the YAF is generally
viewed as such. “But we’re not as
monolithic as people think.”

V racism and the academic racism of

To inform the students of Pitt of
racism, the SDS members attend
classes where they feel racism
exists. They circulate petitions and
confront students and professors.

There are currently about 10
active members in the Pitt’s

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE
/

“People are fed up with the lies
of the Democratic and Republican
arties.” Young Socialist Alliance
SA) President Mark Satinoff
said the YSA offers a realistic
alternative to dissatisﬁed people.

Satinoff said the YSA deals ‘with.

all major political issues on
campus. He cited their involve-
ment with the farmworkers and
Chile issues. .

The YSA also works closely with

the Socialist Workers’ Party [SWP]
and supports their candidates.
, There are indications the YSA and
SWP are gaining increasing sup-
port, Satinoff said. They were able
to get 65,000 signatures on a
petition in the state to have SWP
candidates on the ballot.

Satinoff said the ,YSA will run
candidates again this year for
Student Government. In last year’s

‘campaign many. of the other

candidates were too caught up in
“sandbox politics..,” Satinoff said.

“They don’t realize the problems
of the University have to be linked
up with the problems of society as a
whole.”

“We’re the only organization that
can solve the problems.”

College Young’ Democrats (CYD)
state president Bet Nelson shares
the views of some other CYDS and
Pitt College Republicans (CR) that
student political involvement is not
what it once was. “After McGovern
lost a lot- of people became disil-
lusioned. The problems with Nixon
and Watergate didn't help at all.
Students are much less willing to
become totally committed, totally
involved."

CR Vice President Pat Nixon
agreed, saying she sees a move,
towards more establishment poli-
tics. “People aren't getting invol-
ved in radical organizations any
more."-

“We’re going through a weird

For too many students Rohe claim-
ed, “College is one big social whirl.
Everybody thinks about getting a
job when they get out. There’s a
small "minority of students at Pitt
who do all the work. ’

. “But the trend is slightly turning.
Freshmen attitudes are better; they

'weren’t as hurt by the McGovern

noted the Socialist Workers Party

presidential election, the most of
any of the minority parties.
Richard Meritger of the Young

“There is no student apathy.
Students see the political structure
as unbcnding, unfeeling. They feel

Writer Raps Warre

BY ARNIE GREENWALD
“It was a ‘crossﬁre that killed
John Kennedy,” contended Journ-
alist ‘Bob Katz Monday Night
before a large audience in David
Lawrence Hall.
His lecture entitled, ‘.‘Who Killed

JFK” raised serious doubts about
the accuracy of the Warren

Commission Report, the assassina-
tion’s official federal ‘investigation
committee. Katz provided what he
called proof that a conspiracy
existed. ’ A

At various points in his lecture,
Katz _implied that the FBI, CIA,
Army and the Dallas Police
Department were involved in a
conspiracy, and asserted two
snipers shot JFK, one ofthem in

. the Dallas School Book Depository

and the other standing behind
a fence on a grassy knoll nearby.

By Katz’s judgement of the timing
and placement of_ the shots that
killed former President Kennedy it
would have been impossible for Lee
Harvey Oswald to have shot three
bullets in the amount of time the
Abraham Zapruder home movie of
the assassination shows took place.

TWO THOUGHTS
  AT SMALL ~

BY DOUG GEBHARD & JESS M. BRALLIER

We got trouble...right here in three rivers city. It seems that some
students haven't been acting up to par at Student Union Annex
\ activities and Oakland residents aren't particularly pleased with the
 whole -situation...not that they are to blame or we students are to
blame, but some things have to be put into perspective.

At a recent Annex dance, troubles arose after a large number of
students were not admitted ot it. Drinking and roaming around, made
Oakland residents upset, and justifiably so. Here’s where the hassles
lie: people came who weren’t supposed to be there,_ i.e., non-students
and the lines outside resulted in boredom and related activities.

Notice: no tickets will be sold at the door (give the Student Union Box
Office a try). Hopefully this will elminate any‘idle hanger-outs and
minimize confrontation with Oakland proper.

And secondly: there are a lot ofpeople who like to drink. they will not .

be permitted to drink in the Annex.

‘Any alcoholic beverages or

smoking stimulants (ragweed, cow manure,.etc.) will be checked at the
door by Programming students. Once inside anything discovered will

be checked with concert officials.

It may sound like mom and dad telling_you-to be careful...if that's the
, way you feel, OK, but the Allison-Alexander concert this weekend is
A I/__,-‘;§'the one they’ll be looking out for. Should anything go wrong we might
as well forget future events there. If you have never been tothe Annex
you are missing quite an experience, because it creates the atmosphere

~ for a very intimate show. Why lose it just because someone has to get

high?

Recognized is this fact: most of us like to enjoy a concert; But is there
any reason why altering your perception will enhange it? Especially for
this show. If you need someone to carry you in...that's alright but do it
before or after the .gig, but not at the gig...please.

Some really tremendous shows are scheduled for this year, and a

.1. majority of them would be at the Annex...unless this show proves to be
 otherwise. We, all want you to have a good ‘time...so please do.

Theatre Ups ' Services

BY JESS M. BRALLIER
Pitt's theatre arts department has
taken another step. '
Another step out of its 11th floor

fkhole and into the entire educational‘

experience of the College of Arts
and Sciences.

Coordinator of the Theatre Arts,
Dr. Attilio Favorini recently an-
nounced the formation of a new
program available to all University
instructors. The Instructional Per-
formance Company will present,
upon request, scenes from plays,
dramatized poetry readings, and
Reader’s Theater selections rele-
vant to the instructor’s subject

' materail.

Two graduate students, Sha Leg-
nard and Toby Beckwith, are the
company's directors, managing six

‘performers who receive theatre

arts course _credits for their work.
Costumes and props will be used in
the performances only if necessary
and available.

Beckwith believes the possibilities
for the in-class performances are
unlimited. "it is entirely possible
to present three different ~in{pres-

sions or interpretations of one

Hey, you know Chilly Billy? And‘
Bill Cardille? Well, they're the
same person. No really, of course
they're the same person, but I
mean the guy. the voice, the
attitude, everything that you see
Saturday night, well damn it,
THAT ,IS the real Bill Cardille!
Really, they're as interchangeable
as bricks. -

Yeah, the fool, although he’s
really not foolish atall, met me
with a “Enter into my chamber,
pleeeease.” The voice was that
weird, drawn out low spook sort of
tone, the type of voice you laugh at
until a lonely,’ dark alley shows up.

Chilly started right in on Chiller
Theatre,.“Chiller's been going for
about 10 years, it's been quite a

success. Iguess I never expected it '

to do so well, the thing just took
off." if

He, was amazing, or maybe
surprising...sort of handsome, a lot
classier than you might expect for

better than knits, and I the un-
healthy gu’t was practically gone.

“So we come up with some ideas
that really cracked us up, the show
takes off, people drop in, kids with
ideas and they work. The show just
worked.”

Chilly calls an ad man in and he
spits out a few ﬁgures. “We go for
the 18-49 age group, everybody
does, and we pull in, rather
consistently, the largest'.viewer-
ship. Sometimes as much as ‘/3 of
the televisions being watched."

“You know, it's really too bad that
there's no local TV done anymore.‘
Chiller‘s about the only one." He
looks remarkably healthy. Chilly'-

found by an associate of Frank

with some female reporters and be

That’s where he’s come. frorn._..
the inﬂuence of Nat'King Cole...
and that sweet rum, I bet. His

favorites included Jamal, Garner, _

Fats Waller, Wynton Kelly, Oscar
Peterson, and the forever great Art
Tatum.

"Now, Mose Allison is funky...a
blend of country , and blues and
jazz, his music reflects life.

Through the message of music he"

tells a story which can be applied to
all phases of life. Some have
referred to him as the “spiritual
godfather of today’s crop of singers
and songwriters.”

Others consider him “possibly the

best country artist playing today.”

when Bill Cardille tells it, it's

you'd feel bad not laughing...

Pitt Soccer Problems

BY YAIER LEHRER

At Point Park College, there are
seven West African members on
the soccer team. Chris Bahr of
Penn State's squad will play on the
1976 edition of the US Olympic
soccer team. The,,Mountaineers of

‘ West Virginia wi/ll~ﬁeld this season
a freshman goalie whose claim to
fame is that he has been a high
school All-American.

At Pitt there are not West
Africans playing. Neither is there
an Olympic caliber player, nor a
former high school All-Amerimn.

They belong to the team for the
sole reason of the love to play
soccer.

The problem is that when the Pitt
squad faces teams such as WVU or
PSU, the Panthers are playing
against schools that have well
financed, thoroughly recruited
programs, the direct opposite of
Pitt's program. The difficulty aris-
es out of one thing, money.

“A good high school player will
not come to Pitt for an inconse-
quential scholarship when he can
get full tuition or better at some
other schools." says Coach Leo
Bemis. g  A  W m

West Virginia’: entire soccer

arship program. There are no high
school soccer teams in the state, so
the Mountaineers recruit and give
scholarships to players from good
high school teams in New York and
Massachusetts, not to mention a
team member from Nigeria.

Bcmis does not get the money and
therefore is unable to afford the
high level of recruiting that is done
by the other major colleges.

"if we had some money for
recruiting." observed one team
member, “some of us would be out
of a job." '

Bemls puts it another way.

East’s No. 1 Team
Prepares For USC  

BY G. W. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers will go into this
week’s game against the University
of Southern California as the East’s
number one team. The Cats were
rated as the number eight team in
the AP poll this week, 10 spots
higher than the Trojans who are 0-1
aftter their‘ opening‘ loss to
Arkansas. But the Panthers, who
may be picked as the favorites this
week, won’t be able_ to rest on their
laurals because they will be facing
one of the nation’s top teams.

“We can’t go out and try to

‘ impress people,” cautioned Pitt

coach Johnny Majors, speaking at
the weekly Pitt press luncheon.
“We have to play loose and not try
to live up to our ratings. We need
to play relaxed and with emotion
and enthusiasm because we have
everything to gain by winning this
game.” ~
' “We’re going to have to play a
better game than we have thus far
to stay ‘with them and to beat
them,” Majors continued. “I’m
sure they won't look like the same
team that lost to Arkansas.”
Saturday’s game will put two
exciting running backs on display,
both All-Americans last year and

BY STEVE SYBERT

If you should ever be up at 6:30
am and see a group of guys striding
by your window, do not be
alarmed. It is probably just the Pitt
cross-country team out for their
morning run.

These dedicated athletes begin
each day by running five miles or
so and still make it to 8 and 9 am
classes. But that’s only the
beginning. The real workout
comes in the afternoon when Coach
Jim Banner’s barriers trot 10 to 15
miles more in order to prepare for
their meets.

“These guys are very dedicated.
tenacious.” says Banner. “They
are the hardest workers in track.
It's the nature of their event. The
guys who run the most will come
out the winners."

But just what motivates cross-

”country runners? Do they actually

sure bets to be picked again at the
end of this season. USC will have
senior Anthony Davis in their
backﬁeld, a real game-breaker who

will have to be stopped if the 5.,
Panthers are to make it three in a.;,-T.-

row. Davis gained 74 yards on 20
carries against Arkansas and added
a 100 yard kickoff return for the
Trojans only score.

‘Of course, Pitt will have sopho-
more Tony Dorsett running from
the tailback position. “TD”
compiled 168 yards against Georgia
Tech to up his season total to 249.
Tony needs just 23 yards to become
the all time leading rusher in Pitt
football history, and its almost sure
he’ll get those yards this Saturday.

“We were pleased to welcome
Tony Dorsett back,” said Majors in
reference to Dorsett’s improved

performance against the Yell --
Jackets. “He had a. good game 7"

against Florida State, but we
opened a few more holes for him
against Georgia Tech, and he ran
for daylight.”
Probably the
factor in this week’s game will be
the play of the defensive lines.
Both teams have outstanding

will need to stopeach other’
running attack. ~.

Pitt’s defense added another
superb performance last Saturday
and have to be considered one of
the top defensive crews in the
country. This week’s game will be
the first really big test for the
Panthers although they handled
the potent Georgia Tech wishbone
easily.

“Georgia Tech was not as strong@\

‘V

physically as Southern Cal will
be,” said Majors. “They (Tech)
couldn’t run inside because we
were stronger than they were.,
Southern Cal may be more effective
especially with the running of
Anthony Davis who is a fine
running back with good quickness
and .balance.”_-

Once again, middle guard Gary
Burley will lead the defensive
charge. Burley was phenomenalﬂin

shutting off the middle. He made

12 individual tackles against Tech,  __l
forcing the Ramblin’ Wreck to run’ , , ff‘!

wide from their wishbone.

“Burley has the makings of the
best lineman in the country,”
Majors said. “He’s a definite
candidate for the Outland Trophy
and he’s comparable to (Lucius)
Selman from Oklahoma and (:Rich)
Glover from Nebraska. He’s_ got
good size and strength and he's
very quick."

This week marks the first time in
over 10 years that Pitt has been
rated among the nation’s top 10
teams. A win over USC will surely
move them into the top five. But,
as Majors ‘said, “the ratings are no
the important thing. What V

important is that you play you’rew

best and give it all you have.” The
Panthers will be fired up for

even basis, we'll have to match
their program or we'll go through
the same thing that the football
team did for ten years."

in the past, Pitt has had players
that have given the team the
respect it deserves, but they are all
gone. Joe Luxbacher, Dennis
Kohlmyer. Bill Haines, and Fer-
nando Carriquiry all graduated last

year with Tim Tremont abandoning

his undergraduate work for dental
school. '

The loss of these players has
sorely deleted the team of many
experienced players who will have
to be replaced by those who are
much more experienced, some of
which have never played organized
soccer. '

“it is very true that we are in an
era of rebtiiltliiig." says Beinis.
"On the other hand. the only way’
we can get cxpcrieiiced players to

replace our losses is through junior
college transfers."

At Penn ‘State. the non-revenue
teams, those that don't bring
Inoncy in, have greatly benefited

"from the success of the football

team. whose extra monies have
filtered down to provide more
scholarships and recruiting funds.

It is quite possible that this will

“ happen with the success of Pitt

football.‘ but the immediate prob-
lem is what can the team do now.

The present picture may ' be
dismal. but the Pitt team is far from
terrible. It's just that they have no
superstar. someone they can de-
pend on to lead them. Every effort
has to be a total team effort. or it is
a lost cause.

lliere is one other thing that the
soccer team lacks apd that is
confidence. One of the reasons for
this is last SattIrtlay's 7-1 loss to
West Chester.

“My cousin went there four
years,” Parrish noted, “and he
was in and out of the lineup.‘ I
wanted no part of that.”

Parrish- got his chance to play
when middle guard Gary Burley
was injured in Pitt’s first game last
year. He started against Baylor,
was injured for the Northwestern
game, and has been a permanent
institution in Pitt’s defensive line
since.

According to defensive line coach
Jim Dyar, Parrish has “improved
50% over last year.”

“He played very well against
Florida State,” said Dyar. “Of
course, that is his home town.”

“It was just like playing a
Crosstown rival,” said Parrish of
the Florida State game. “My
parents were in the stands, and it
felt great.”

Parrish’s biggest improvement
has been in his . technique. As
opposed to bulling over people in
high school, he has learned when to
hit and when not to hit, and his
progress has been the benefactor.
The defensive line has changed
for the better according to Parrish.
One of the important factors has
been the cohesiveness of the unit.
“We only lost‘ one player this

. year, and. we’ understand each

362-6113
4 p.m.

earn $1 .00°extra.

Class of 19

other. We are all’ very close.”
One of the most sought after
players in Florida according to

Dyar, Parrish sets goals for

himself..

For the upcoming game against
Southern California, Parrish said
he wants to have at least one
sacking of the quarterback, and

hold Anthony “TD” Davis to les 3, 

than 100 yards rushing.
~With Parrish’s rate-of improval,
future opposing quarterbacks are
going to wish he hadn't come to
play; For Pitt fans, “Parrish” the
thought.

Credit Pirates’ Comeback  

BY DOM GLIOZZI

‘So it came to pass that the Pirate team of l973_ no longer posessed
that magical bag of tricks which was its trademark the three previous

seasons.

Gone were the exciting come-from-behiiid ninth inning

victories, the back to back homeruns,’the electrifying defensive plays,

the tight relief pitching and so on.

Instead they found ways of losing ballgames they should have won, A
lack of consistent hitting, key errors at crucial moments and some
pitiful pitching had the Pirates resembling your old neighborhood

‘ pick-up ‘team rather than a« competent major league ballclub.

May, to be replaced by unfamiliar names like Ken Brett, Ed
Kirkpatrick and Jerry Reuss. The pitching staff. bolstered by Brett and
Reuss was prepared to mow down opposing batters while the hitters
with the aid of Kirkpatrick would terrorize the league once again.

Well, they began the season with optimism and yes, even a little dash
of hope but it didn’t work. The Bucs fell flat on their faces, losing their
first six games and digging an abyss by mid June. ‘

Yes sir,_those marvels of mediocrity were at it again, only this year
their bungling ways seemingly knew no bounds. When the pitching

produced, the hitting power just wasn’t enough. And oh those mental   28 Market Square 3715 Forbes Avenue‘

what they knew they were capable of. That meant putting together the
hottest streak in baseball as they played near .700 ball from mid July to
the end of August. The brilliant starting pitching remained brilliant,
the batting attack re-appeared and the once questionable defense

My hat goes off to Joe L. Brown, Danny Murtaugh, the players and

  Motivations Of A Long Distance Runner 

Despite the physical punishment,
there is much satisfaction to be
found in running cross-country,
and Coach Banner sees this in his
team. “They take a lot of pride in
their accomplishments and their
goals." said Banner.

“Running is a personal thing with
me,” explains junior John Heiser.
“Trying to run faster than I ever
did before. I get satisfaction from

  

[and also track] is that fans do not
turn out to view the results ’of the
your teammates," Heiser added.
“We're a close bunch of guys. It's
important to have a close relation-
ship to function as a team."

One sad thing about cross-country

  

runners’ hard work and dedication.

"It's just not as popular as most
sports," reasons Boyd.

According to Heiser, only parents,
personal friends, girlfriends, and
roommates of the runners ever
show up at a cross-country or track
meet. “Other sports provide help
though. Our football success may
help the whole sports program,”

he said.

Still, the runners remain undaun-
ted. They will continue to run their
daily 15 miles without complaint
and endure the punishments of
such rigorous conditioning. Cross-
country runners are truly a rare
breed. And why’ does one go
through it? '

“I enjoy it, that's all."
