A 15-year-old juvenile was sen-
tenced to three years at Shuman
Center after being convicted in
Juvenile Court on two countsjof
rape, 14 counts of burglary and
one count of involuntary deviate
sexual intercourse.

The youth was given the maxi-
mum sentence allowed by the
state. ‘

After seven hours of testimony
on Dec. 10, Common Pleas
Judge Joseph Jaffe sentenced the
youth to three years in .the Al-

legheny Intensive Treatment Unit
for juvenile sex offenders. The
youth will remain, in a specially
structured program under the su-
pervision of the juvenile justice
system until he is 21.
Pittsburgh Police arrested the
youth on_Nov. 6 in connection
with a series of rapes, burglaries
and assaults between July 2 and
Nov. 4 in south Oakland
apartments. . .
Prosecutors had petitioned the

COUl't t0 try the _teenager 35 an

adult, but the request ‘was denied
by Jaffe, according to Assistant
District Attorney Ronda.Win-

necour. /
Winnecour said Jaffe felt the

youth should receive treatment in_.

a juvenile center.

’’As far as I'm concerned, he’
can't be in there long enough,”
said one of the victims.‘ ’’But I
guess it's fair because he's so
young, but I don't agree with it.”

Under the state juvenile sen-
tencing system a judge can ex-
tend the incarceration if
necessary after periodic review of
the case.. The sentencing can go
beyond the original maximum,
but not beyond the defendant's
21st birthday.

Rather, he finds it-so intriguing

that he has redirected his aca-
demic career to pursue it. He has '

Moyer, who became’ Student

Democrats blast Reagan's proposed budget

WASHINGTON — Democrat-
ic congressional leaders Tuesday
assailed President Reagan's pro-
posed 1988 fiscal budget of
$1.02 trillion as ”way off track”
and announced they want to
meet with him to draft a com-
promise.

On Monday, Reagan sent his
proposal to Capitol Hill, where,
for the first time during his
presidency, the Democrats have
control of both houses of
Congress. _

Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd promptly questioned the
president's financial calculations,
challenged the accuracy of deficit
projections and suggested Rea-
gan rewrite his budget proposal.

Also Tuesday, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole said the
proposal was ”way off the mark”
and questioned the White
House's financial projections.

Under the measure, military
spending would rise slightly, but
many domestic programs would
suffer massive cuts. Among the
cuts would be $3.5 billion in sub-
sidies to college students.

Controversy surrounds one part

of the proposal: whether or not
taxes would be raised. President
Reagan flatly said the measure
”absolutely does not raise taxes.”
But House Budget Committee
Chairman William‘ Gray called
Reagan's claim of no tax hike ”an
absolute falsehood.” Gray said
the budget tries to hide the tax
hike by calling for ”user fees for
government services and sale of
government assets.”

Victims’ families sue
Puerto Rican hotel

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Fa-
milies of two of the victims of the
New Year's Eve fire that killed 96
people and wounded 140 others
filed lawsuits Tuesday seeking
$19 million in damages from the
Dupont Plaza Hotel.

The suit charges hotel manage-
ment with negligence in the
death ofJuan Rosario Torres and
in" the injury of Jose Aponte
Rodriguez, who was in the casi-
no when the fire broke out.

The suits contend that the

gent in failing to install fire-

prevention measures such as.a
sprinkler system, fire walls and
lighted exits. Also, the suits
charge that the hotel did not have
an adequate evacuation plan.

Federal investigators have al-
ready determined that the cause
of the fire was arson, though no
specifics have yet been released.

Claims have surfaced that the
teamsters union at the hotel may
have been behind the blaze, but
the union vehemently denies any
involvement. Just minutes before
the blaze broke out, the union
voted to strike.

Pittsburgh area man

PITTSBURGH — The lone win-
ner of a New Year's Eve ”Super
7" Lotto jackpot of $12.8 million
said Tuesday that on. the day he

et, he forgot his glasses and filled

JOHANNESBURG, South Afri-

Tuesday that seven blacks died in
incidents of weekend violence,
including a 7-year-old girl who

in deadly train crash

CHASE, Md. — Federal inves-

Conrail locomotives ran through

junction where they were
rammed by a speeding Amtrak
passenger train.

The worst train crash in Amtrak
history killed at least 15 and
wounded scores of others. Offi-

wreckage Tuesday in hope of

finding more survivors but admit- '

ted there was little hope of find-
ing anyone alive in the twisted

The Amtrak train, 15 cars long,
slammed into the line of locomo-
tives, causing many cars to derail
and some cars to pile on top of
each other.

Afghan rebels treated at ShadysideHospital

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Janatmir Jalahaddin has been a
freedom fighter since the Soviets
invaded Afghanistan on Christ-
mas Eve 1979. He has lost two
fingers and his left leg. Doctors at
Shadyside Hospital are working
to repair his right leg.

Said Jalahaddin, ”I have noth-
ing on my mind except to go
back and fight.”

Last October, the Soviet army
attacked Jalahaddin’s base at the
Pactia province on the border of
Pakistan southeast of Afghanistan.
He stepped on mines planted by

» Russians and was taken by friends

to an_ international Red Cross
hospital.

The medical facilities there
were inadequate for his needs.
Aided by the Committee for a
Free Afghanistan in Washington,
D.C., and the Pittsburgh—based
American Humanitarian Support
for._the Afghan Tragedy, Jalahad-
din was brought to the United
States for treatment at Shadyside
Hospital.

Dr. Timothy Janeway, an ortho-
pedic surgeon at Shadyside
Hospital, is one of the organizers
of the new|y—formed, Pittsburgh-
based group. At his suggestion,
Shadyside Hospital cooperated
with a program providing free
medical treatment to the Afghan
refugees. Nine Afghan citizens
have been treated in Pittsburgh
and nearly 200 have been treat-
ed throughout the United States.

”The hospital was very suppor-
tive,” said Janeway. ”They were
happy to contribute.”

Janeway and wife Joyce have
been making trips to Afghanistan
since 1972, sharing modern treat-
ment techniques with doctors
and nurses.

 

I Don Mofismon/The Pitt News

From left: Kuchi Gul, Mohammed Abrahim, and Janatmir Jalahaddin.

”It’s good to have people like
myself here to take care of the Af-
ghan refugees,” said Janeway.
”The.Pakistani hospitals do not
have the facilities that we do. But
treatments do get expensive and
so do hospital stays. The next
people we have here will proba-

bly have to be_outpatients.”

Mohammad Abrahim, 19, is an
outpatient being treated for an el-

-bow injury. He became a free—
dom fighter five years ago.
Abrahim and some friends were
spending the night in a village
near his hometown when they
were bombed by the Soviets.
Abrahim managed to escape to
the mountains but lost his brother
and his cousin.

”As long as I |ive,iand aslong
as there is blood in my veins I will

fight,” said Abrahim.

Kuchi Gu|,»22, received treat-
ment at the Eye and Ear Hospital
in Oakland. He is also anxious to
return home to fight. Gul stepped
on a land mine near the Khyber
Pass, resulting in the amputation
of the lower part of his right leg
and injury to both eyes. Surgery
on Gul’s eyes have restored them
to almost normal. .

Gul said he is inxa hurry to be
fitted with a prosthesis so he can
continue to fight, explained inter-
preter Habibb Zikria, an Afghan

refugee who was a university in-_

structor in the capital of Kabul.

Zikria is missing a brother and
brother-in—law. ”They were work-
ing for the state department,” said
Zikria, ”and were taken prisoner.
They are still_missing.”

Zikria is determined to help
those still in Afghanistan. He is
living with his brother in Fox
Chapel where they are housing
Gul and Abrahim until they are
ready to return later this month.

Zikria said his people are not
ready to believe the Soviets’ an-
nouncement of a Jan. 15 cease-
fire. ”If the Soviet Union is seri-
ous about the cease-fire, they
must present a timetable. Then
we wouldbe willing to discuss it.
My people are willing to get the

‘United Nations’ troops to come

in and watch the withdrawal. But,
I think it is a.gi_mmick to mislead
the people,” said Zikria.

Gul agrees with Zikria. ”This
declaration is a big lie. They want
people to think that they are for

peace. They want to show us as

 

being the aggressors.”

More than one million people

have been killed since—the Soviet
invasion. There are an estimated,
5 million Afghan refugees and
thousands of Afghanistans are
missing. But they are more deter
mined than ever. I

According to (Jul, the freedom , _
fighters use a hit—and-run strategy _ 9 
to push the Soviets. '

”We are successful even now,”
said Gul, ”because with their
huge army and sophisticated
machinery they cannot control
Afghanistan. They are imprisoned
on their bases while we are free»
to move.” , I _ T

Zikria explained that the
Soviets have placed - mines
around their bases in order to..
keep the freedom fighters out and ,

also to contain potential ‘I
defectors.

Gul said the lack of weapons is7 ‘
a big problem.

”Everybody wants to’ fight,”
said Gul, ”but we just don't have
enough weapons. We also need-
anti-aircraft missiles and mine de-
tectors.” ' »' ».

Gul wonders why the United
States doesn't help more’. ”We 
are not only fighting f_or_o,ur free— ' I L"
dom but also to protect the. Per- -
sian Gulf area. I

”We believe and we hope that
our country will get free,” said
Gul. “If they [the Soviet troops]. —
kill all the men, then our women _.
will fight them back.” I '

.Zikria and Mrs. Janeway, CO-“I
chairman of ‘the American Hu-, 
manitarian Support for the Af- .
ghan Tragedy, would like to raise 
enough money to get a Pittsburgh ...
apartment to house the ,Afgha“ns,
who come here for treatment. 

They also seek involvement A
from students at the University of ‘i
Pittsburgh. . L’ I

Bosworthcaused
his own troubles

Brian Bosworth, the Jim McMahon of the National Collegiate
I Athletic Association, is no longer playing for the Oklahoma
Sooners. On Monday, Jan. 5, Oklahoma's coach Barry Swit- ‘
zer announced that he had asked Bosworth to forgo his senior
season of eligibility. ‘For those of you not familiar with the plight
of Bosworth, he has put himself in a compromising position
because steriods were found in his system. The use of steroids
among college athletes is a serious problem, and the actions
’ _ taken against Bosworth prove that their use will simply not be
tolerated. ‘
When the steroids were found in his blood stream, the
NCAA’s first action was to ban him from the Orange Bowl, in
which Oklahoma played Arkansas. Bosworth was permitted on
the field during the game, though he was not allowed to play.
The Orange Bowl is a huge media event, as are all of the
bowl games. The story of Bosworth’s troubles was well known
-A by game time, which was proven by the many cameras aimed
; in his direction. Evidently, Bosworth felt that he had been treated
 unfairly by the NCAA. He must have thought that his banish-
 ment from the Orange Bowl was cruel and unusual punishment.
‘ -‘How could one arrive at such a conclusion? It was easy; all
anyone had to do was read what was printed on the sweatshirt.
' he wore on the sidelines: ”National Communists Against Ath-
letes’»’ and “Welcome to Russia.” _
 How can someone who clearly deserved his punishment try
 ‘ "to blame the NCAA? The NCAA is to be commended for the
" » actions taken -against Bosworth. Instead of looking the other
V way, as they seem to have done many times in the past, the
, NCAA saw an infraction and punished the perpetrator.

 Posvar helps Pitt

fix‘ the

of a prosperous career

How many times has your
mother told you, ”Now, if you

"want to get anywhere in the

world, you have to go to school
and get good grades." Perhaps
you grew up believing that if you
can't break over the 3.0 QPA bar-
rier, you're doomed to get a
mediocre job‘ in the hometown
you always wanted to get out of.
You probably think that only
those who graduate this year with
a 3.9 QPA or higher are the only
ones who will get those golden
jobs with the starting salary of
$35,000, a company limo and

three—week vacations. Wrong,.

wrong, wrong.

What do QPA and extracurric-
ular activities have to do with
each other? Quite a lot.

Being a junior,\I am reaching

A the point where I am spending a

lot of time worrying about what
I will be doing to-earn a living
once I graduate from Pitt. Next
autumn’ I'll be writing hundreds
of letters asking for interviews
and going to interviews. And
since the interview is basically
the only passage -through to a
regular 9 to_ 5 job, I've been re-
cently researching how to best
prepare. My research has turned
up some helpful pointers. I’d like
to share them with you.

My first obstacle to overcome

The ”Looking Beyond”
column-of Dec. 3 raises an in-
teresting point: drugs are now a

part of our culture, and intelligent _

use lessens their harm’. I am not
writing to-debate this statement.
I am writing to further illustrate
that drugs are already a part of

with the interview is my QPA: It's
OK, but I know there will be peo-
ple interviewing for the same job
opening with a higher QPA, so

I've got to find another significant,

area to top them at. That's where
extracurricular activities come in.

At the end of my Introduction
to Fortran class last semester, our
instructor invited in a-gentleman
who was near retirement from the
computer industry. He had
started out in the 1940s as an Air
Force pilot, one who flew some
of the first jet—propulsion fighters
in existence,'and then left to be-
come asalesman for the rest of
his life. He had no significant
background ‘in ‘computer
programming or science, yet in
the mid—I960s he began selling

and demonstrating the first com— I

puters commercially available.
I'm sure you know how much

computers have changed in the

past two decades (from room-

‘sized monstrocities that used pre-

punched cards for programming
to the IBM PC). Yet this man
stayed in the computer hardware
business during that entire‘ peri-

religion and nationalism drugs?
Should we educate our children
on the dangers of unchecked
patriotism? Should we police our
borders for contraband religious
pamphlets? Of course not.
Religion and nationalism are not
problems in themselves. The

problem is misguided souls abus- .

money. His secret?

”Your generation doesn't have
a good work ethic,” he told us.
”You go into a job interview and

- ask about job benefits, retirement

plans and vacation lengths, but
rarely show the interviewer that
you are sincerely enthusiastic
about working for the business.
A company invests a lot in you as
an employee, and in returnthey
want you to produce.”

Now this gentleman had also _A

been a job interviewer for his
company, so I feel confident he
knows what a job interviewer
wants. And what does the inter-
viewer want to see? ”The willing-
ness to work. ,We want to know
that you can handle responsibili-
ty, that you'll get the job done,
that you'll shoot for a goal and
reach it instead of merely coming
to work every day to breathe the
office's air. You need to prove to
me that you will work, and work
successfully at your job.”

And that's where extracurricu-
lar activities come in. You may
notice a 4.0 student, but you may
beat out the guy with a_‘3.7 QPA
with your 2.9 QPA by ‘showing
the interviewer, through your ex-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 7, ‘I987

A pet makes a house or apartment a home

So, Helen's gone. I knew it, of
course, but it hit me the hardest
when I was shaving the other
morning, and I looked for her to
be up there on the counter in
front of the mirror, checking out
both of our reflections.

Helen was my cat. I got her in

1973, when she was a kitten. This ’

year her health had deteriorated
terribly, and finally a veterinari-
an, to use the euphemism, "put
her to sleep.” She was I3, which
I am told is rather old as far as cats
are concerned.

I never considered myself to be
a pet person, but Helen changed
me. She put a little symmetry in
my life. I just mentioned the fact
that I was shaving, and I noticed
that she wasn't up there on the

. counter by the sink — that's what

she always used to do, every day;

I’d get out of bed and go into the A

bathroom to shave, and there
would be Helen, watching us in
the mirror.

It wasn't a bad feeling nor a
good feeling, having her there
every morning; it was just a case
of something in my life that I

obsesses me night and day. It is

male is a friend and colleague
and knows how I feel, and of
course he tells me that our friend-

or sex exists. We go out and share

‘interests and dance and have

meals together (my partner
doesn't mind). I feel as if I am the
only woman in the world caught
in such a madness. How can I get
out of this?

should be a master mechanic
with inherited wealth.

As a youngster in California, I
used to watch Clark Gable tool
along Ventura Boulevard in a
black Jaguar, vowing there would
be one in my future. The dream
came true a decade later in Indi-
anapolis, where a dealer pointed
to a shiny, 6-year-old Jag and
called .it a steal at $1,200. .

could count on. If it was morning,
there was Helen. Symmetry.
She wasn't the nicest cat in the
world; when she got in a bad
mood, she tended to scratch and
nip. That was OK, though; I'm
not the nicest human in the
world, either, so we got along just
fine. She could be ornery in other
ways. Sometimes she would hide

‘and refuse to come out. There is

an electric can opener in the
kitchen, and usually the noise of
the can opener whirling away
would be enough to draw her out
— she would think a can of food
was being opened for her. But

‘when she was determined to be

annoying, even the can opener
trick didn't work. She would hide
until I was sure that she had got-
ten locked in somewhere she
wasn't supposed to be, and then
she would come strolling calmly
out. I could almost see the taunt-
ing smile on her face.

She wasn't much better with
strangers. Helen spent her life in-
doors, and_ when someone she
didn't know came into the apart-
ment she became very protective

love doesn't only happen with

as you might expect to be. Let me
say that many women havefallen
for gay men and suffered a deep
shock on learning that the man is
gay, proving that they could fall
for such a man —— normal instinct
did not guard them against mis-
taking sexual identity. Also,
women who have loved gay men
have gone on and formed new at-
tachments with new men who
responded to them as desired.
We have here a mystery, a twist
of human experience causing a
lot of pain ‘and confusion, but
nothing for‘ the loving woman to
blame herself for or feel ultimate
despair about. ” *

is no harm in having a little fan-

which he can be what you want
him to be. But to get out of this
present pain you are in, you have
to take some measures that re-
quire a lot of character. I '

First, you have to give up those
dates with your gay friend. If he
is a real friend, he will under-
stand. I don’_t mean to say you'll
never have lunch with him again,
or exchange Christmas presents
again, or whatever the customs of

tionship. But all through the '70s
and into the '80s, she was almost
a reflection of my own life.‘ Every-
thing that happened to me during
that long period of time, Helen
was there, too, and it's
melancholy to consider that
whatever happens from now on,
she won't be there.

How many mornings and
nights did I watch her trot over to
her blue bowls —— one for food,
one for water — and gobble up
whatever was in there? She was
a fast and silent eater — put the
stuff in front of her, and she
would do away with it. And how
many times, as I unlocked the
front door, did I hear her mew-
ing, waiting for me, -rubbing up
against the inside of the door in
anticipation of my coming home?

It has been about a week that
Helen has been gone, and there
are moments when it doesn't
even occur to me that _she’s dead.
I'll walk into the kitchen and
wonder where the.blue bowls
are. Then I'll remember: They're
not needed any longer. They've
been thrown away. '

I'll put on a tape and instictive-
ly look for Helen to come pranc-
ing into the living room; she
always liked the sound of music,
and at times it would seem as if

she was trying to dance. But of _
course when the music comes on

now, there's no Helen.

I suppose it's just a new fact of '

my life: I used to have a cat, and
now I don't have one. We went
through so much together. I'll
think back to all of it, and I won't
be able to envision it without see-
ing a white cat with black and
grey markings.

I hear that what you're sup-
posed to do when a pet dies is to

go out and get another one right —

away. I don't think that's going to
happen. Helen and I shared a cer-

Mayer

Continued from page 1

Mayer said the turning point
was a course called Computers
and Culture.

”As soon as l was taking this
course, I knew exactly what I
wanted to do,” he said. ”lt was
so clear to m.e that artificial intel-
ligence was something that I
could devote my entire life to,
and it's going to be a life pursuit.”

Meanwhile, Mayer will con-
centrate an the thought process-
es of Pitt students. He considers
student apathy to be the biggest
problem on campus, and it com-
pelled him ta campaign for the
Student Government Board presi-
dency last fall. Mayer won by a
1,328-846 margin against Jay

Rothstein, and he took over for,

Jim Mumma yesterday.

Mayer has served on the SGB
Allocations Committee, the
University Senate Committees on
Quantitative Reasoning and Hu-
manities and the Pitt Program
Council. He has also been in-
volved in the Mentor Program
and Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

He said the antidote to apathy
starts with active student leader-

.ship. ”l’ve spoken with alumni

and so forth, and they said that in
recent years, Pitt has lasta lot of
its school pride,” Mayersaid.

”The spirit can come back. I
see it coming back., If we can
show that this Student Govern-
ment Board is proud of its school,
that it cares about its school
enough to do things for the stu-
dents, to really go out of its way
to do these things, then maybe
the students will appreciate this
enough to become involved.”

He has many proposals for in-
creasing student involvement,
such as:

* building a university night-
club on the William Pitt Union
ground floor which would be
open until 4 a.m. on weekends;

* educating students about
South African divestment policies

. and holding a referendum to de-

termine their opinion;

* raising the student activities
fee by $6 per semester to increase
funding to student organizations;

* initiating telephone polls of
200 randomly-selected students
on various issues, conducted by
the Freshman Council;

* holding board meetings in
the student union ballroom and

inviting students to ask questions
of their leaders.

Mayer previously said he
would hold a referendum before
proposing to raise the student ac-
tivities fee, which students pay
each semester to help -fund stu-
dent organizations. He said he

decidedagainstthe referendum, .

however, after talking with" Dr.
Conney Kimba, vice president for
student affairs.

”Our student organizations are
crying for more money, and I
think that we can give it to them.
I think that is ample enough
referendum,” Mayer said.

Mayer also cut the proposed
increase from $15 per student an-
nually ta $12 per student. If ap-
proved by the board af trustees,
the fee would rise from $24 to
$36 per ‘semester for full—time
students.

’’I think that would more than
cover it,” he said. ”Twelve dal-
lars is three large pizzas during
the course of the term," as ap-
posed ta Greek Week, Engineers
Week, Black Week, Nurses

Week, Geology Club's trips to"

rack sites, tours of the Nationali-
ty Rooms, films, lectures and
poetry readings and so forth.”

Mayer said he does not plan to
be a passive president. Some of
his predecessors have been criti-
cized for running for president
only to bolster their resume.
However, Mayer's plans after
graduation include enlisting in
the Peace Corps and attending
graduate school, hopefully at
Yale, and he does not expect his
presidency to help further his
career. .

”This can't be used an my re-

sume. I mean, I'm in computer A:

science, for God's sake,” Mayer
said.

”My father laughs at the fact
that I became Student Govern-
ment Board president. He’s a
scientist, and whenever every-
body was congratulating me and
telling me this was going to-be
fantastic for my future and so
forth, my father and my brother,
the level heads in the family,
looked at me and told me it

_ wasn't going to do a thing for me.
”They said, ‘Why are you do-.

ing it?‘ "

’’I saw the Student Government
Board and realized that same-
thing could be done. I sa_id to my-
self, ’I can do something far that,
for this university.’ Like I said be-
fore, when I pursue something, I

‘pursue it to the end. It's all or

nothing,” said. Mayer.

Tl-IE pm NEWS, Wednesday, January-7, 1987

Posvar is overprotected  

I don't really deal with pub-
lic relations people much.
When you have to deal with
them as a journalist, it tends to
make you nervous. For a per-

son in public relations, an or- .

ganization can_do no wrong.

‘The old saying "no news is
good news” is easily switched
to a newspaper focus of ”good
news is no news.” I mean,
good news is nice, but we're
supposed to put out a paper
that people will want to read.
Like it or not, good news can
often be quite boring.

For all intents and purposes,
Wesley Posvar exudes good
news. The university he leads
is solid financially, academical-
ly and athletically. As an enti-
ty, the University of Pittsburgh
fallsinto the good category. -

There are, of course,. things
that go down in the system
that need to be checked, but
generally the university itself
is,‘ well, one large yawn.

When I went to interview
Posvaryesterday about his
receiving the ”Pittsburgher—of—
the—Year” award, this weird
thing happened. Usually, when
we interview administration
members, it is by phone.
Although I had talked to Pos-
var several times before, I had
never sat down with the man '
face—to-face. In fact, I didn't
know where his office_was.

I called Mary ‘Ann Aug, who

LOOKING
BEYOND

DIRK KAUFMAN

is director of the Department
of News and Publications for
the university, and she told me
where it was.

”Thanl< you,” I said.

”All right,” she said. "I'll see
you clown there.”

Mind you, I wasn't going to
talk to the man about a huge
scandal in the university. Of
all the things to talk to a presi-

, dent about, winning an award

has to be the most harmless.
So, we three sat down and
had the interview. He recalled
some interesting things about
student protests in the late '60s
and about the competition be-

. tween Pit’: and Ch/*-.Ll.

Unclerstancl, Wesley Posvar
islan interesting character. He
possesses a thorough know-
ledge of foreign policy, holds
several academic degrees and
was a Rhodes scholar. He also
flew in the Berlin Airlift.

Every time I talk tohim, I
wantLto drop my list of ques-
tions and justvsaly, ”So, what
was flying in the airlift like?”
and then sit back and listen
while he relives the past.

But I don't. There isnever
time.

At any rate, he doesn't need
someone to answer questions
for him. At least he didn't on
this occassion.

I had thought since she was
there, that Aug would have
something to say. Or some-
thing to ask of me or him.

All she did was go in, sit be-
side me quietly in his large,
well decorated office, and
leave with me.

I have always had a good
relationship with her and ex-
pect it will continue. I didn't
mind her being there any more
than if any other person were
in the room. It’s just one of
those things where a person is
there-,Iand it bugs you when
you don't know why.

If she was there to help him
answer some difficult or dis-
turbing question, it bothers me
that I didn't ask it. it bothers
me even more that I have no
idea what that question would
be.

I called her back later in the

‘day but couldn’t contact her. I

guess I'll find out later. But she
is a public relations person,
and I was always taught to talk
to them with one eyebrow

raised in disbelief. I can't help -

It.

In the meantime there is
some question out there that
went unasked. That, most of
all, will bother me to no end.

An alternative to the dorms

By Lisa Ann Krisay
For The Pitt News ‘

Most often, the only alternative
to on-campus housing is an apart-
ment. A new alternative to dorms
and apartments, called shared liv-
ing, is being offered. -

Housing Ministries lnc., formed
in 1983, provides Homesharing,
a housing program for those who
prefer a relaxed atmosphere and
a more home-like environment.

‘With shared housing, two or

more unrelated people share a
house, each having his own pri-
vate bedroom and sharing other
living areas such as the living
room and kitchen. ’

V According to Lucy -Hixon, ex-
ecutive director of Housing
Ministries |nc., two applicants are _

selected on the ‘basis’.-of their“

common interests and goals.

range an interview with a
representative from Housing
Ministries. If the‘two agree-to
share a house, they will undergo
a one-month trial period during
which they will decide upon rent
and other living‘ arrangements.
Unlike college dorms, where
there is sometimes little or no
privacy, Homesharing _offers a
more personal atmosphere with

available companionship. The.

most difficult part for all parties
involved,— according to Hixon, is
the pairing of compatible people.

This new option offers advan-
tages for both the individuals in-
volved and the community, in-
cluding reduced housing costs by
shared living expenses, social
and emotional support through

increased compahionship, a safer I

and more secure living environ-
ment, a more efﬁcient use of per-
sonal resources and a more effi-

‘profit

cient use of existing housing.
The program was originally a
demonstration project im-

plemented through the South
Hills

Interfaith Ministries and
funded -by the Pennsylvania
Department of Aging. '

Two basic types of shared
housing programs are being de-
veloped throughout the country:
congregate and -Homesharing.

Congregate or group homes _are '

comprised of four or more peo-

ple sharing a residence, which is"

jointly owned or is under non-
sponsor ownership.
Homesharing programs are
offered by nonprofit organiza-
tions which provide a matching

-service to facilitate private

homesharing agreements be-
tween two or more persons who
want to share aprivate home,
which is owned or rented by one
of them.

Both parties are contacted to ar-

PSU professor offers guidelines for counseling

By Dr. James E. Van Horn

For The Associated Press

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Every
one of us, at one time or another,
has the feeling that our world just
isn't right. We may feel blue, dis-

« cou raged, down—in—the—dumps,

empty or depressed. We simply
don't feel like ourselves. Maybe
we have these feelings about our
family or marriage. There may be
obvious problems.

Do these feelings mean we
need to see a counselor? Not
necessarily.

In most cases, these feelings
will pass in a day or two, and

we'll feel OK again. lf,.on the _

Members
wanted

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

, ‘As one of the largest universi-
ties in the state, Pitt prides itself
on its medical program. Although

nursing students account fora '

large portion of the medical stu-
dents, the Student Nurses Associ-
ation of Pittsburgh, which offers

-these students opportunities for

advancement, is experiencing a
serious lack of members. .

Although approximately 600
students are enrolled in the
University of Pittsburgh's under-
graduate nursing program,- only
about 20 are members of SNAP.
According to Debbie _Kro|l, a
member of the group for two
years, SNAP has been struggling
to increase membership.

’’I don't see any reason why
nursing students shouldn't join.
Belonging to the organization can
only benefit them,” she said.
”We have a professional respon-
sibility for our future.”

SNAP, which has university,

state and national chapters,
serves as a lobbying group for fu-
ture nurses who are concerned
with legislation that affects their

careers, such as standards set for‘

state boards.

Kroll is hoping to recruit more
members this year by extolling
the benefits’ of becoming a
member.

”We offer scholarships, and
many student nurses don't know
that. We also attend a national
convention every year, where we
vote on issues that affect those of
us pursuing a nursing profession.
This -year it will be in Chicago.
We are also preparing for the '88

convention which will be held in '

Pittsburgh,” said Kroll.

SNAP is also involved .with '

community service projects, the
most recent being a Christmas
party held for the children at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic._

”lt’s incredible that no one

wants to be involved,” said Kroll. _

Kroll is especially concerned
with building a stronger organi-
zation before thePittsburgh con-
vention.

”The more members you have,
the more delegates you are al-
lowed, and the more influence
you can have on national legis-
lation,” she said.

Upcoming events for SNAP

will include participatingin the.

Hand-in-Hand festival and at-

tending the Chicago convention"

from April 1-5.   

' other hand, these feelings ‘or

problems stay with us for a peri-
od of time and continually upset
or worry us, then perhaps we
need to get some help from a
counselor who can help us work
through whatever is bothering us.

The following are some gener-
al guidelines.

You should see a counselor if,
over a period of time, you don't
feel emotionally up to par, are
disturbed about your life or aren't
coping well with everyday hap-

penings and situations.

Seek help if you feel blue and
depressed a lot, feel like you have
lost your energy or lost your en-
thusiasm and interest in most

everything, and there is no obvi-
ous physical cause.

You should see a counselor if
you find you have little or no in-
terest in other people, withdraw
from contact with people, can't
make decisions, are unable to
concentrate or have physical
problems that have no medical
cause.

Everyone has some of these
symptoms. An occasional
headache or backache is com-
mon among most people. Every
once in a while we find a partic-
ular decision difficult to make.

We may withdraw from one or
another person or group. But if
any of these is a recurring

problem that gets in the "way of
our daily living, then it is time to
seek help.

If you experience repeated and
continual relationship problems
with a spouse, child or relative,
then seek help. Again, all rela-
tionships have problems, but
help is needed when relation-

ships become hostile, problems"

are not handled effectively or
there is almost a total breakdown
in communication.

You should seek help if a habit
gets out of hand. For example,
you or a family member is drink-
ing too much, has a drug problem
or can't overcome a fear such as
one about flying, meeting new

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 1987

 

By John Enright

Sports Editor '

1 Maybe it was a blessing in
 disguise. But then again,
maybe it wasn't.

Whatever the case may be,
Pitt's 67-65 win over the
Akron Zips at Fitzgerald Field
' House on Monday night

showed the schizophrenic ten-
dencies of the Panthers
(ranked 14 by AP).
Last week Pitt won the Rain-
bow Classic in Hawaii by
defeating three big-time teams
(Kansas,__Arkansas and Wis-
consin), but the Panthers have
struggled at home the last two
games against solid but inferi-
or teams — especially inferior
consideringthe Panthers tre-
mendous home-court ad-
vantage.

For the second straight
game, Pitt (10-2) came out flat
in the first half, digging a hole
for itself that could only be
overcome by the impressive
play of off—the—bench senior
center Tico Cooper. 1

Last Saturday night against
Providence, it was Cooper
who rescued the Panthers
from defeat. in that game,
Cooper grabbed numerous 7

g clutch offensive rebounds and
was near-perfect from the foul
line down the stretch in Pitt's

76-67 win. Cooper was sub-

bing for Charles Smith, who 5

dominated the game but spent
. portions of the second half on
the bench with foul problems.

Against Akron (10-2) ‘the
script was similar. in the first
half, Pitt came out slowly, and
if it weren't for an All—World
performance by Smith and
two ill—advised technical fouls
against Akron coach Bob Hug-
gins, the mighty Panthers may

Too close

have been out of the game
early.

Due to the excellent three-
point shooting of Akron guard
Eric McLaughlin, the Zips had

a comfortable 29-21 lead with ‘

5:42 left in the half. McLaugh-
lin had four three-point goals
in the first 10 minutes of ac-
tion. He finished the game
with seven for 21 points.
But Smith, with a little help
from Huggins, was not to be

denied.

Smith scored 24 of Pitt's first
28 points, including seven
straight when he was fouled
and Huggins was hit with two
technicals in less than a
minute. I

”Charles was thereason we
were still in it in the first half,”
said Evans.

Smith hit five of six foul
shots and concluded his spree
with his fourth slam dunk of
the night on a feed from-Cur-
tis Aiken, pulling the Panthers
to within one point. And
although Pitt still trailed at half-
time 36-35, they had ‘momen-
tum going into the’ locker
room.

Still, Evans wasn't pleased
with Pitt's first-half perform-
ance. ’’If you screw around
against a team like Akron for
the first five minutes, then they
get confidence that they can
play with you. And that's what
happened,” said Evans.

But the way Smith was play-
ing, it seemed only a matter of
time before Pitt would put
away the pesky Zips. '8

Not so fast.

Smith picked up his third
and fourth personal fouls a
minute into the second half
and then fouled out at’ the
eight—minute mark. He

of the season 92-73 at the hands
of Big East power. Villanova at
Fitzgerald Field House last night.

”We got buried,” said Pitt
coach Kirk Bruce. ’’.As I told the
team I really believed we could
win the_game. We had a good

game plan, but o.f course it's only-
as good as your ability to‘ follow,

through."

The loss dropped the Lady Pan-
thers record to 3-8 overall and 0-3
in Big East play. Villanova im-
proved its mark to 8-2 overall and
3-0 in_the league.

B'ruce said that his players were
”in total awe” of the talented

It was a long season of ups
and downs for the Lady Pan-
ther volleyball team. Pitt won

lost games it should have won.
However, the Lady Panthers
finished the season with a
respectable 29-12 record.

The Lady Panthers won the
Big East title by defeating
defending champion Provi-
dence at home in November.
The volleyball team realized
another season long goal with
an NCAA bid, although Pitt
lost 3-1 to Nebraska in the first
round. of the tournament in
early December.

Despite the loss to the Corn-
huskers, Pitt earned a lot of

Next season the Lady Pan-
thers are looking forward to a
big year. Every player returns
with the exception of senior
Sue Hoover. Hoover,‘ team
captain for the 1986 season,
will leave a big pair of shoes
to fill. She was named the first
ever All—Bi g East Athlete of the
Week, and to the first team All-
Big East and the NCAA’s

However, the loss of

Mulvihill and Lisa Stewart. All
three were selected as mem-

Stewart represented Pitt on the

The Lady Panthers "will have

They will not face a light

The Lady Panthers will have a

NCAA football playoffs?

By Tim Liotta
AP Sports Writer

SAN DIEGO —— An NCAA
committee said Tuesday it would
study the possibility of a nation-
al football championship playoff.
If approved, the new system
could be in place by January
1989.

The committee will begin its
study in April. Any plan would
have to be approved by vote of
the full NCAA membership. The
next such possibility would be
during the January, 1988 conven-
tion,‘which means a playoff sys-
tem couldn't be put into place
until the following January.

’’I’m not even sure I'm in favor
of a playoff at this point,” DeLoss
Dodds, athletic director at the
University of Texas, said. Dodds
will be chairman of a subcommit-
tee that studies playoff ideas.

Other committee members will
be John Swofford, athletic direc-

tor at North Carolina; Glen Tuck-
ett, athletic director at Brigham
Young, and Carl James, commis-
sioner of the Big Eight Con-
ference.

Dodds said he would favor a
plan that keeps the current bowl
structure intact.

”We’re thinking along the lines
of a one-game playoff after the
bowls. But it's a long way away,”
Dodds said. ~_

”The bowls put $41 million
each year into the colleges. The
bowls have been good for college
football.’’» '

Dodds said the most interest in

S a football playoff comes from the

public -and the media. ”The-insti-
tutions do not seem as interest-
ed,” he said.

There have been several
studies previously._

”One advantage we'll have this
time is we'll know ‘what hap-
pened with the Fiesta Bowl,"
Dodds said. Top-ranked Miami,
Fla., and No. 2 Penn State, both
independents, met in a much
ballyhooed championship show-
down Jan. 2 in the Fiesta Bowl.
The game, won 14-10 by Penn
State, drew intense interest
around the country.

”l’m not sure what the factors
will be in the decision,” Dodds
said. ’’I can't speak for others. But
some of the considerations would
be the time demands on the
student—athletes, public interest,
interest among the coaches and
the institutions/.’

Pitt

finished the game playing only
17 minutes. _

The Panthers, appeared to
be in trouble, considering the

' way Zip forward Marcel
Boyce was filling it up.

The left—handed Boyce
scored 14 second-half points,
finishing the game with 27,
and Pitt couldn't handle him
in the paint. .

Enter Cooper, who is begin-
ning to show flashes of bril-
liance in a reserve situation.

With the Panthers down
59-55 with 4:30 left, Cooper
hit a turn—around jumper to
pull Pitt within two.

And a minute later, Cooper
made a layup and was fouled.
Cooper could have tied the
game with a foul.shot, but he
missed. Demetreus Gore
grabbed the rebound, though,
and put it in to give Pitt a
63-62 lead. _

And super-sub Cooper put
the game away with a layup
off a missed foul shot by Rod
Brookin with 00:53 left.

, ”You can't give Pitt those
second shots,” said Huggins.
”We did everything except
block out at the free-throw
line.” '

While the game was one of
Pitt's least impressive perform-
ances of the year, it was '
nevertheless a win, despite the
fact that Pitt's best player,
Smith, spent the majority of
the second half on the bench.
”Charles kept us in it the first
half, and we did it in the sec-

”They showed good charac-
ter,” said Smith, speaking of

Gore trying to shoot his way out of slump

By John Enright

Sports Editor

With the Panthers riding the
crest of a five—game winning
streak, one would think all of
Pitt's top seven players are play~
ing at the top of their games.

That’s. not the case.

Small junior forward De-

> metreus Gore has had his mo-

ments in each of the Panthers’ last
five victories, but his shooting
and scoring percentages have
dropped oft‘. . h

After Pitt's first six games of the
season, Gore was shooting 60
percent from the field while scor-
ing 17.7 points per game.

But in _Pitt’s last six games,
Gore was shooting only 38 per—

'3 cent from the field (33 of 85),

although he was still able to
pump in 15.3 points per ga'n’:e,
incltiding a career high 30 against
Wisconsin in the championship
game of the Rainbow Classic.
Core, for one, isn’t concerned.
’’I just have to keep shooting,”
said Core. ’’I’m taking extra

T"”‘5_3hooting practice. I'll break out of

.—./vs‘

L!’

"It.

Teammate Charles Smith

agrees. ”There’s nothing wrong .

with Demetreus,” said Smith,
who leads Pitt in shooting per-
centage at 64. ”He’s just missing
right now. He'll be fine.”
Panthericoach Paul Evans is
pleased Pitt has been able to con-
tinue its winning ways while
Gore's shooting has gone cold.
He also knows what the problem

pit?
to ram
ou cll

may be. ”Demetreus is thinking
too much. He's at his best when

. he just let's it all hang out.”

For the season, Gore is averag-
ing 15.5 points while shooting 49
percent from the floor and 84 per-
cent from the foul line.

>i< * >l=

‘Pitt captain Curtis Aiken was
named Big East Player of the
Week for his MVP performance
in the Rainbow Classic. Aiken
scored 84 points in the three
games, including a career-high
37 against Arkansas. He made 13
of 22 three-point» field goals in the
tournament. 5

Aiken became the 14th player
in Pitt history to score 1,000
points when he took a micl-court
pass and slammed one home
against Providence last Satur'clay'.

Core needs 80 points to be-
come the 15th player in Pitt his—
tory to score 1,000 points.

Surprising Stat of the Week: Oi
Pitt's five starters, Charles Smith
has the least number of minutes
played (435). He is averaging
28.7 minutes per game. Aiken
leads the team with 36.3 mpg.

Providence coach Rick Pitino is
0-2 against Pitt at Fitzgerald Field
House,» but he still loves to play
there.

’’I think it's the toughest place
to play in the Big East, but I love
it,” said Pitino. ”The atmosphere
is great, and it's true college
basketball. It's my favorite place
to play.”

Wrestler Santoro following dad's footstps

By Brooks Thomas

For The Pitt News

Ask any youngster who his
favorite wrestler is and you may
get several answers. Hulk Hogan,
The Junkyard Dog, and Rowdy
Roddy Piper are just a few of the

responses you may get. Ask

University of Pittsburgh wrestling
coach Randy Stottlemyer and the
answer is simple and decisive ~
Pat Santoro.

”Pat is what you look for in a
recruit,” said Stottlemyer. ”He is
an outstanding wrestler and a
good student. He is very quiet,
but he leads by his actions. That
is a great virtue. i just can't say
enough about him.”

- Santoro hails from Bethlehem,
Pa., where his father had been an
outstanding wrestler at Lehigh,
one of Pitt's most fierce rivals.
And why shouldn't he be one of
Stottlemyer’s favorites? As a fresh-
man last season, he had a 28-6
record and achieved Al|-America

, -status in the 142-pound weight

class.» Santoro and teammate Kyle
Nellis, also All—American at 134
pounds, led Pitt to a 9-3-2 record,

Stottlemyer’s best to date and
Pitt's best since the 1978-79 sea-
son. In turn, Stottlemyer was also
honored by being selected the
Eastern Wrestling League's Co-
Coach of the Year.

With the graduation of Nellis,
a heavy burden has fallen on San-
toro’s shoulders. Or has it?

’’I’m not really a rah—rah guy,”
said Santoro. ’’I tend to lead by

example. We have some really

great leaders on this team in
[senior co—captains] Gary Bolin
and Eric Wertz. I try not to put
any unnecessary pressure on my-
self. I get a little nervous before
each match, The nervousness
goes away right when I walk oﬁt
onto the mat. I block everything
out of my mind when I am
wrestling.” 3

Santoro, a graduate of Bethle-
hem Catholic High and the Blair

- Academy, is off to a very fine start

this season. He has a 23-1 record
and has had a great deal of suc-
cess in the tournament field this
season. He has alreadylwon the
Eastern Nationals, the Ohio
Open and the Lock Haven Invita-
tional. Santoro also placed sec-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 7, 1987

Into the home stretch: The NFL’s final four

By Thomas Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

Finally, there are four. With the
completion of the divisional
playoffs in the National Football
League over the past weekend,
only the Cleveland Browns, Den-
ver Broncos, New York Giants
and the Washington Redskins re-

main in competition. Here's a.

brief review of the weekend's ac-

‘tion and a look at the upcoming

AFC and NFC title games.

In Municipal Stadium, the
Cleveland Browns celebrated
their first playoff victory since
1969 in tip—toeing past the New
YorkJets 23-20. The Browns’ win
did not include a particularly im-

_pressive effort from their ”Dog

House Defense,” nor did Bernie
Kosar’s 489—yard passing outburst

 shred the Jet pass defense into
submission. In the spirit of the

holiday season, the New Yorkers

3’ pitifully gave Cleveland the

game, gift wrapped in futile offen-
sive play calling and an equally
embarrassing prevent defense.

-.-With 4:08 left to play in regu-
'f a _ . .

lation and pinned deep in their
own territory, the Jets held a
20-10 lead over Cleveland. New
York, firmly set in their ”bend
and then break” defense, allowed
10 quick Cleveland points, and
the overtime misadventure was
set. '

Instead of attacking the Brown
defense by throwing the ball up-
field, Joe Walton's club played it
safe, running into the teeth of a
determined Cleveland front line.
No play—action passes. No
screens. No long balls to the
speedsters Al Toon and Wesley
Walker. These grounded Jets
played to lose, to end an already
dismal season, and Mark
Moseley granted their wish by
booting a 27-yard field ‘goal ear-
ly in the second overtime. When
the going got tough, the Jets
booked winter vacations. Maybe
they should change the color of
their uniforms — from green to,
perhaps, a pleasant shade of
yellow.

Hear about the large quake in

Chicago over the weekend? It
measured a whopping eight on

the Richter Scale. The center of
the disturbance was at Soldier
Field, the site of the Bears’ 27-13
loss to the resurgent Washington
Redskins, and the eight came
from the play of Redskin QB Jay
Schroeder.

Why was Schroeder the key?
His stats, 15 of 32 for 184 yards,
weren't all that impressive. But he
is experienced, at least more ex-
perienced than Bear QB Doug
Flutie who struggled with his
short-to-medium range passes all
afternoon. The Bears’ lack of
solid play at quarterback finally
caught up to them. Schroeder has
been under center for over a sea-
son and a half; Flutie for only a
handful of games. Washington's
No. 10 minus Chicago's No. 2.
That was the difference in a
shaken Soldier Field. ‘ '

”Oh, My!” — shades of Dick
Enberg, indeed, but on the ”NFL
on CBS,” only the New York Gi-
ants have fit that description this
season.

New York's 49-3 crushing of
the 49ers really shouldn't have
been a surprise to anyone. After

all, Bill Parcell’s club has inces-
santly been collecting superb
defensive talent over the years,
and the ensuing results have put
them. into the NFC Champion-
ship. ”They played a game as
well as any team can play,” said
49er safety Jeff Fuller.— ‘'1 don't
think the Redskins can beat them
if they play with the same inten-
sity of today.”

The.Giants held the vaunted
San Francisco ground game to 29
total yards, and yielded only nine
first downs throughout the entire
game. Displaying domination
similar to last year's champion,
the Chicago Bears, New York is
the definite favorite to win their
first Super Bowl. If their win over
the 49ers is any indication of
what's to come, go ahead and
make it a double ”,Oh, My!”

The weekend's best game was
played at Mile High Stadium,
where the Denver Broncos
slugged their way past a tough
New England squad 22-17. John
Elway lofted a 48-yard spiral to
Vance Johnson at the.end of the
third quarter, providing the Bron-

Message to Students at the University of Pittsburgh
on the Impact of the TaXReform Act of 1986

on Scholarships and Fellowships

The Tax Reform Act of 1986, recently signed by President Reagan, will have consequences for many students. Although the law

1 -is effective for the tax year 1987, the regulations governing the implementation have not yet been published, and there remains sub-
stantial ambiguity about some parts of the law. The University, therefore, cannot assure you of absolute or continuing accuracy of
this preliminary attempt to give you notice of the revisions to the law.

 

- The Act generally provides that degree candidates may only exclude from gross income the portion of scholarship and fellowship

I  awards expended for tuition and course—related expenses (i.e., fees, books, supplies and equipment required for courses). All students

will need to maintain records to document any excludable tuition and course—related expenses. Non—degree candidates will no
longer be, entitled to any exclusions. , . A

' The’ new tax law is effective January 1, 1987 for scholarships and fellowships granted after August 17, 1986. Prior law applies
to scholarships and fellowships granted before August 17, 1986, no matter when the proceeds are actually paid to the student. Prior

law will also apply to those amounts of a scholarship or fellowship awarded after August 16, 1986 that are actually received, and
s ‘ attributable to expenses, before January 1, 1987.

‘In light of the above, the following tax circumstances will probably apply for 1987, subject to any changes brought about by future
federal regulations: , — .
Undergraduate Students.

Scholarship and fellowship awards that are given to undergraduate students and that are not compensation for services performed _
for the University, will be excludable from gross income, to the extent the awards c/over tuition and course-related expenses (such

as books, fees, supplies or equipment required for courses). Any amount in excess of tuition and course—related expenses will be

will regard such salaries as taxable income. The University will withhold taxes on these salaries, as it has done_ in the past. In the
past, some TA/TF/GSAS and Academic Advisors might have been able to claim that this salary was not taxable income because the
work performed was a degree requirement. The tax law provision that exempted from taxation compensation for services performed

_ pursuant to degree requirements, has been eliminated in the new law and such salary must now always be considered as taxable income.

This weekend, while the
basketball team will be battling
Big East rival Georgetown, San-
toro and the rest of the team will
be tangling with nationally
ranked Lehigh in Santoro"s
hometown of Bethlehem.

’’I’m kind of excited about
wrestling in front of my

hometown,” said Santoro. ”But

it's just another- match for me. I
have to go out and get the job
done/’

_And what a job it will’ be as
Santoro goes against the coun-
try's premier wrestler Peter Yoz-
zo. Last year at Fitzgerald Field
House, Pitt shocked the Lehigh
Engineers with a spirited 21-21
tie, in that match, the young San-
_toro gave Yozzo everything he
had and the heavily favored Yoz-
zo barely escaped with a 8-7 de-
cision in the waning moments of
the match.

Probably to the surprise of his
hometown and Lehigh wrestling
coach Thad Turner, Santoro
elected to pass on going to Le-
high and instead chose to attend
Pitt. , T‘ .

’’I felt really comfortable with
the guys on the Pitt team," said
Santoro. ’’I felt like I fit right in.
The main reason I chose Pitt was
because of academics. Pitt has a
great reputation for its health-
related curriculum, and that is the
area in which I would like to con-
centrate.” .

‘ Another reason people thought
Santoro would stay in Bethlehem
was because of his family's in-
volvement in Lehigh’s wrestling
program. Both his father and

' brother were All-Americans for

the Engineers. His father also was

A a teammate of Coach Turner.

The Panthers are now 1-0 in
this thebeginning of the season
after defeating Waynesburg 41-3.
If Santoro and Pitt can get by the
challenge of Yozzo and the en-
tire Lehigh team, the Panthers

' _will get a big win, and Santoro

will even his score with Yozzo

and likely be on the road to

repeat asan All-American.

”Pat is a definite All-America
candidate again this year,” said
Stottlemyer. ”He can be a nation-

PITTSBURGH — In a major
shakeup following consecutive

Steelers on Tuesday ousted play-

the son of the team's owner and
brother of President Dan Rooney.

The Steelers also announced
that Coach Chuck Noll will be-

duties previously handled by Art
Rooney. Controller Dennis Thi-

the No. 2 man in the front office.
”Our object is to establish
direct lines of communication
and better internal communica-
tions,” Dan Rooney said. ”This
will enable us to function more
efficiently. Our goal is to bring a
championship to Pittsburgh.”
Thimons will have no authori-
ty over Noll on football matters.
