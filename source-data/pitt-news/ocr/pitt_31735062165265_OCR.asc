Baseball, Parking
Don’t Go Together

Students will be scratching
their heads again and wondering
at the parking problem when the
Pittsburgh Pirates open their new
season April 13. With the base-
ball season and spring atlhand,
Pitt students’ thoughts will turn
to parking. ‘

If they don’t, many students
may be standing beside blocked
cars in Schenley Plaza, waiting
for the game to ﬁnish. The new
season- opens April 13 with three
successive exhibition games be-
fore the regular home season
starts. _

It may help the situation if

' students were aware of the pos-

‘ sibilityof being hemmed in, and
\ thus watched the Pirate schedule

of home games. A schedule will
be on the main bulletinvboard on
« the ground ﬂoor,‘ for those inter-

Brodhead-Garrett Co., and Holt-
zer-Cabot Electric Corp. and
Micro-Switch Co. '

In 1948 he was a partner in

the management consultant firm’

of Slade, Rogers and Vieh. He
joined Cresap, McCormick and

Over Competition

University directors are making plans for a full and
part—time medical staff. The problem facing these men seems
to be bigger than just internal policy, for Pittsburgh doctors
are very worried about the “competition” from Pitt’s Medi- A

cal School.

; In a message to the Urological Assn., and in statements
to the press, Dr. Robert A. Moore, Vice Chancellor of the

School of Health Professions, stat—¢ .

ed that the full-time faculty plan-
ned for the Pitt Medical School
are joiningthe staﬁ primarily for
purposes of education and re-
search, and not for the practice
of -medicine.

Dr. Moore mentioned that -Pitt
will emphasize _a small core—not
over six full-time men in each
department. These full—time men
will receive a salary, from Pitt,
but may not keep any other

‘earnings that they may receive
in private practice. Any other
fees must be deposited in a seg-
regated fund in the University,
and the chiefs of the clinical 'de-
partment will determine how it
is to be spent.

In 1953-4 Pitt maintained, nine
doctors. These men, as__.part'-time
faculty, earned $116,000 from the
University and $90,000 in private
practice. In 1954-5 these same men
as full—time ‘faculty members
were paid $211,000 in salaries, and
earned only $51,000 in fees. This
$51,000 was turned over to the
special fund, for no full-time fac-
ulty member may keep any extra
fees earned during his stay at Pitt.

One of the controversial points
dealing with the proposed new
full-time faculty is whether they
should have the privilege of see-
ing a limited number of private
patients. ‘Dr. Moore believes that
the full-time men should be ex-

ROTC History Teacher Hypnotizes

Captai11—T{eceiVed
Military Education
In Many Schools

By SHELLEY WEISS’
After twelve months in Korea,
Captain Charles M. Thompson Jr.,
assistant professor of Military
Science and Tactics, claims he

still “can’t tell a_ North Korean I

from a South Korean. They don’t
say y"al1 or’ anything like that.”

Captain Thompson, who receiv-
ed his military education from
ROTC in high school, Texas Agri-
culture‘ and Mines, " Oﬁicers’
Training School and Highest
Quartermasters’ School, teaches
American military history to
freshmen. He is also adviser to
Pershing Rifles, honorary army
fraternity, and Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, social fraternity. ‘

According to the captain, who
has seen much of the world, New
Guiena means “rotten coconuts
and there’s nothing like it except
more coconuts.” His observation
of Koreans was, “They didn’t
value life.” »

After watching Australian tribe
chiefs ‘perform hypnosis on their
subjects, Captain Thompson in-
quired further into ‘its mysteries.
With the help of an American

friend and Australian books on

the art, the Pitt instructor de-
veloped a technique and a voca-

. tion. . '

Explaining the difference be-
tween hypnotism and mesmerism,
he stated that mesmerism in-
volves the sense of touch, while
hypnotism is the power of sug-
gestion. In applying hypnosis, he
has no immoral intentions he
said. Furthermore, he‘ explained,
the hypnotized victim will say or
do nothing he would not ordinar-
ily do. , .

This hypnotist performs the or-
dinary acts of making lemons
taste sweet and suspending people
between chairs,,but prefers to uti-»

in Silverman Studies
Field of Ceramics

, For Half Century

By IRV JACOBS

“If you absorb science
properly and learn to utilize
 it, you can become a real bene-
_':-« ﬁciary of the knowledge you
possess.” Perhaps no man’s
,1... .-liafe is better testimony to this
" statement than that of
author, Dr. Alexander Silverman,
Professor ‘Chemistry Emeritus,
hereat Pitt. Dr. Silverman, a vet-
eran of .over ‘ﬁfty years of origin-
al study and’ research in the ﬁeld
of ceramics, has made accom-
plishments that have, in fact,

beneﬁtted the entire ‘world.

His glasses have foﬁnd uses for
such, varied needs as the protec-
tion from glare, in decoration
schemes, and in protection from

atomic radiation at today’s mod-
V ern atomic plants. In his half
.1’, century of work in the ﬁeld, D_r.
' Silverman has made glasses of
practically every color and prop-
erty. ~ - . C

A‘ _ ' Entered in 1897

Dr..‘Silverman, a- strong believ-
g er? in determination, entered the
-r  University (the Old Western
’_? University of Pa.) in the fall of

.. 1897 after "only one year of high
school. Upon graduation in 1902
‘as Ia Bachelor of philosophy, his
‘curiosity led him into the ﬁeld of
81353 F ‘

Strangely, his ﬁrst accomplish-
ment was not in the area of some-
thing new, but rather in the re-
vival of something old. At the
.time, the “secret” of making ala-
ba‘ster.glass had been lost for
some twenty years ‘since .the
adoption of the use of pure chem-
icals.

 The marblelike properties of
the glass sad been‘caused by
. certain impurities unreﬁned
' .-from the old raw materials; ~
;. Through the y.ears, Dr. Silver-
H-_--/\"’rrIan’s -accomplisliments have
:' /.__ brought him international repu-
* - tation and acclaim. Ceramics ex-
 -perts through the world have
studied at Pitt under him and
sought his advice in their re-
 searches. ‘
-f '6, ' ‘He‘has popularly been on call
' " by. industry for his advice and
‘ direction of rearch. He has lec-
1‘ tured before learned groups both

      
 
      
 
 

has authored over 225 publica-
tions on “Glass” and related
. subjeicts. - _
Though long recognized as an
authority in his ﬁeld, Dr. Silver-
-man. maintains that he has re-.
.t_-aineid the curiosity of a student
 Jaiiinis life. He insists that ’one
, must constantly keep himself in-
’ formed of new developments in
his "ﬁeld, so as to be always ready
 to adopt and utilize’ them to: im-
' prove his work.  ‘
' _' ’ Keeps Other Features
. “In addition, the doctor has
A ‘ V to maintain several
”,_other features of the student,
he retains ,a,youthful bounce and
vigor that belie his 75 years. 
, XI-Iis youthful appearance, he
~ claims,‘ has been born of his
youthful ideas and enthusiasm
 ‘beneﬁt from the development of
 modern science.‘ His home and
, loﬁice are equipped with the latest
2 in.modern life-easing equipment.
Since 1951, the head of Pitt’s
chemistry department, Dr. Sil-
verma'n has not taught due to the
compulsory retirement policy at
the University. He spends his
/time, though. engaging in a
variety of interests. Researchers
in ceramics still call on him for
‘ advice, and he is often asked to
review scientiﬁc publications’.
Perhaps this greatest present
position, in recognition of his tre-

 

 

butions to chemical science, is his
,, office as Chairman of'the Inter-
 national Board for Naming of

Inorganic Chemicals. D_r. ‘Silver-
 ‘an is presently preparing for

hassling stems from March, 1954,
when the Panther Party fraterni-
ties seceded from IF, and return-
ed only after they were promised
that fraternities would be repre-
sented in IF in proportion to their
active membership. This was to
the advantage of the Panthers
since they were the larger frat-
ernities.

The two factions, the larger

fraternities and the smaller fra-

, ternities, have been grappling
for power in IF ever since. The ,

bickering was intensiﬁed during

the.- past, IF elections when Pan-

  Political Stability 

Except for occasional groups backing prohibition and
vegetarians, the United States has maintained a strict two-
party system, based on Democratic and Republican plat-
forms. . ~ , ' , .

A _It.has worked rather well in stabilizing government due
to the checks and balances with which one side scrutinizes
the actions of the other. Keeps them on their toes.

However, at this University, we have shunted ourselves A

into those formidable ivory towers against such a value of
permanent political parties. Some members of Administra-
tion and not few student leaders have cried out “pol1t1cs”,

and with their minds glutted with only the sordid side, have
failed to see that politics can be clean. » ' .

Last December, Student Congress appointed a special
committee to investigate thepermanency of political parties
on campus. Nothing-has since been heard of the legislators,
which, though not unusual, is disappointing. We imagine that
the ‘item was squelched in committee by thinking -similar to
that forming policy for the women’s elections.

Last year, women were politely told that participation in

. elections with party backing is unbecoming a lady; rather

undigniﬁed. Not even the Luce fortunes could obviously
save Claire Booth from serving a life in purgatory to cleanse
h_er sins. i 

The results of such policy were disastrous this year in
both listless Student Congress and Men’s Council, with

WSGA plodding along in the pattern set ages ago, showing
’ little originality in‘ program. ’ .

With political parties, however, there would be such
pressure groups sanctioned by the university to enforce
promised programming, if elected, to push for a compromis-
ing vote, if in minority, a constructive program for student
activities. Those students with ideas could, with a bloc sup-
port, more easily present them to the chair‘ and hope to have
them, at least, discussed. i

We certainly hope that programming plans submitted,
be talked out, caucused, compromised and presented for a
ﬁnal vote after being well thought-out.

.Certainly there will be political maneuvering.” But this
is not necessarily an evil, although the haphazard, awry
program‘ now in effect will far more easily result in hap-

U hazard campaigning, irresponsible promises, and loose or-

ganization after ‘initial campaigning.’ _. ,
' Permanent parties, properly guided, would give stu-

dents a clear-cut means to carry out government on campus

—-original, vigorous, good , administration. Parties which
failedlto meet these demands would not long last.on a Uni-
versity campus. -

Parking. Space Pirutetl

‘The rejuvenated Pittsburgh Pirates open up the .ﬁrst
of a three game exhibition series at Forbes Field, April 13,
and with the crowded parking situations, students and

A faculty drivers will again get the short end of the deal.

The Pirates have a ‘greater pre-season subscription than ever
before, and more people than last year will probably be
ﬂocking to Forbes Field to see the “new” Pirates with a
new manager ﬁght to get out of last place. .
Pittsburgh police with their eye gauged to the Chamber
of Commerce rather than our registrar’s office won’t hesi-
tate to dole out tickets to students on ball game days—for
parking in localities which hardly meet the University’s
parking needs today. All-day restriction will be the rule.
, Because.we realize that there would be no place for
ticket-buyers were students to park in Schenley Plaza and

Political Machinations

By Irv Rofhmon

With fraternity men slating independents on their
parties’ tickets, and independents slating fraternity
men, the emphasis in the 1956 elections will be

placed on sp1it—ticket voting.

Although individual parties wills,-‘present sound,
platforms — gratifyingly
after last year’s ambiguities—-the party that gains

constructive

power will be the one which
has slated the most‘ leaders
and/or the most popular person-
alities.

Certainly, an equal balance
of both is needed; but from past
experience, what student gov-
ernment needs nowadays are
personalities to
start the wheels .rolling.

When the issues comes down 
, to personalities, athletes prove
known, and the parties have not failed to utilize‘
this source. For example, three “names” have been
nominatedfor senior Student Congress positions-
Darrell Lewis, Tom Jenkins, and Arnie Sowell.
None of them has ever run for a student govern-
ment position, except for Jenkins who is a member
of the Engineering and Mines Cabinet. _Sowell was
a student instructor in the Menis Conference pro-

gram for freshmen.

the schools had problems in cre-

Dormitory Problems

The‘ "second, discussion topic
was on “The Role of Government
in Establishing Standards of
Conduct for Women Students.”
Problems such as dormitory
hours and wearing Bermuda

Although the four representatives
found much of this discussion

Pitt, they said it was interesting
in the light that in thelfuture

when Pitt dormitories are built,‘

these things will have to be con-
sidered. . _

With all the talk of what Pitt will look like some
25 years from now it was a needed change of pace
to turn in the other direction and look back at Pitt

as it was 25 or more years ago.

school year in the 1929 Owl.
Pitt Band Featured

One of the larger groups featu
book is the Pitt band, who, on the :
picture look more prepared to go '
to war than the ROTC Depart-

different then, owing to their tall
blue hats and gold capes. They
boasted of a membership of 70
musicians and even Vdared to
hope for 100 pieces in the near
future. ‘ ‘ .
This smaller band, however,

had some sweet serenading to do in those days, par-
ticularly at the football games since this was one of
the years of the famed Sutherland elevens. The
gridders displayed an unbeaten record that year ex-
cept fora 7-6 loss to Stanford in the Rose Bowl
game which, the yearbook story contends, was due
to a wonderful Stanford team and the long train
ride across the continent to California.~.

year of an unbeaten basketball team. Coached’ by

Occasionally, even" in the world -

that it is inclined to be overlook-
ed or lost in the shuffle when it
does appear. But those who are
fortunate enough to recognize
this talent for what it stands for-,
are indeed the lucky ones. In
this particular case I consider

bum ﬁlled with greatness, this is
it. There are twelve numbers,
and every arrangement is suited
to ﬁt the creative stylings of
Miss Merrill.

True talent is inescapable, and
if there were those who voiced
doubt as to the success of Helen
Merrill, surely now there can be
no doubt — only praise. The dis-
tinctive quality which lends it-
self to these vocal interpretations
is in a word, “originality.” Hel-

Quartermaster
Talks to ROTC
In Washington

_The success of the Quartermas-_
ter Corps in developing expert
logisticians was described by Ma-
jor General K. L. Hastings, Quar-
termaster General, who addressed
60 ROTC cadets from the Univer-
sity- of Pittsburgh and Penn State
University, Wednesday, March‘ 28
at Washington, D. C. .

“On—the-job training, increased
levels of responsibility, and formal
schooling, both in the service
school system and at civilian edu-
cational institL.tions are, we feel
producing Quartermaster officers
of outstanding ability and poten-
tial,” General Hastings said wel-
coming the‘ cadets to the oﬂice‘ of
the Quartermaster General, Wash-
ington, D. C., where they were
briefed on world-wide operations
of the Quartermaster Corps. '

“The margin of victory in any
campaign is usually attributable
to the training, preparation,
equipment. and stamina of the
troops on the winning side,” said’ '
General Hastings. He explained
that, “In like manner, the or-
derly discharge of daily assign-
ed responsibilities in peacetime
requires trained and experienced
personnel with the ability to
evaluate the part they play in
the over-all scheme of life in
general and in the Army in par-
ticular.”

The cadets visited Washington,
to obtain ﬁrst-hand knowledge of
Quartermaster operations. They
were guests of the Quartermaster
General at a luncheon which fea-
tured samples of the latest opera-
tional ﬁeld rations of the type de-
signed for soldiers in the ﬁeld.

Fifty-ﬁve ' of the cadets were
from Pitt. They were accompanied
by Lieutenant Colonel Alan P.
Thayer, QMC senior Quartermas-
ter instructor and assistant profes-
sor of military science and tactics,
and Major’ Lee Roy Beaumont,
QMC, ‘and Captain Charles M_.

35 Million Anti-shots
To be Given by July

More than half the persons eligible for the Salk anti-
polio vaccine will probably not receive their shots by the
peak of the polio season in July, according to a Scripps—

Howard newspaper survey.

The survey estimates that the output of vaccine will

A
not exceed 70 million shots, which

should inoculate about 35 million,
giving two shots per person.

The number of persons con-
sidered most susceptible to the
crippling disease is now 55 mil-'
li'on. It includes children and ex-
pectant mothers.

Officials of the Public Health
Service and National Foundation

 for Infantile Paralysis are more

optomistic in predicting that all
eligible persons will-rec_eive two
shots by July 1.

The survey disagrees on ﬁgures
“official esti-

timistic.”
It also states that the output of

the last three months will have
to be doubled for the official

‘figures to be reached.’ Although

the four manufacturers have a
combined capacity» of 20’ million

‘per month, it takes four months

to make and test each batch of
vaccine. '

Last month’s record output -
eight million shots. M
The four producers are Eli Lilly

First. of a Series

iWalton Leads Ends;
Both Tackles Return

By DON KAISERMAN
Like guessing at the answers on a multiple‘-choice test,
analyzing a football team at spring-training time just can’t
be done with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, in

,a series of four articles of which this is the ﬁrst, this reporter

will cling to the proverbial limb and attempt to present a

sonnel.

Naturally, any appraisal of the
gridders thus far has to be based
primarily on past performances.
And on that basis, Joe Walton,

who last year set a school’record V

for touchdown passes received,

looms as the team’s outstanding

individual performer,

Walton, pre-ministerial ttudent
Bob Rosborough, and Dale Brown
are the three returning lettermen
at the end positions. The latter
duo will have to ﬁll the vacancy
left, by the departure of A1l-East-
ern right end John Paluck.

KiesellBacks Walton
A former All-State fullback at

.Beaver Falls, Walton has devel-

oped into a top offensive star at
left end. Although his main forte
is pass receiving because of his
speed, timing, and maneuverabil-
ity, he is also a better than aver-
age blocker and defensive player.
Backing up Walton is Bob
Kiesel, a 200-pound senior from
Scranton. Kiesel is also a con-

" lverted fullback and is being

counted on to provide the nec-

essary depth at the terminal ’

post. -
Switching over to the opposite
end of the line, Rosborough ap-
pears to have the edge over
Brown. But keep an eye on a 215-

‘ pound, 6-4 sophomore named. Art

Gob, who is rated as potentially

_ a great receiver.

Tackle Spots Look Good

With four of the ﬁve top tackles
returning from last season's Sugar
Bowl team, even .extremely-cau-
tious Coach Johnny .Michelosen
admits that the Panthers. may be
“very outstanding” at this posi-
tion. ’ T - I

A big,,“if” is the recovery of
last year’s starters, Bob Pollock
and Herm Canil, from knee
surgery. Big, tough, and experi-
enced, 22,0-pound Pollock is rat-
‘ed .one of’ the n atli o n ’s top
tackles. '

Junior «Ronnie Kissel, ‘a 225-
pound giant from McKeesport is
available to provide some depth
at the left tackle post. -

McCusker Has Chance
on the right side, Canil is being
pushed for the ﬁrst-stringlberthby

Jumbo ’Jim McCusker, who, at

245 pounds, is-the biggest man on

the squad.
'Canil, a “small” 210-pound
senior, is .perhaps the best

blockerlon the team. Relatively
fast, his specialty is downﬁeld
blocking. A
On the other hand, McCusker
is a defensive standout. Enemy
ball-carriers have found it almost
impossible to run through-his po-

sition, ‘and 1‘~./Iicxhelosen used him

last season whenever a goal-line
stand was necessary. Both _men
undoubtedly will see a lot of ac-
tion. , ’ l ' ,

Financial Wizard of Field House

George Rules the Roost
From the Field House to Sugar Bowl, Kenneth George,

Business Manager of the Athletic Department, handles all
money connected with Pitt’s sports program.

George has been with the University since 1938, with
- a 33 month stint in Army Ordinance during World War II.

George held his present position since 1949.6 .
All of Pitt’s athletics, in addition to WPIAL games

at the Field House, and summer 9

‘operettas at the Stadium, are
handled by George. "During the
football team’s stay in New Or-
leans, he was responsible for
securing reservations, paying
bills,
happy. . _
In.an interview with the.PITT
NEWS George commented on the
excellent behavior of the students
who accompanied the squad
south. “They didn’t give the peo-
ple down there any reason to re-
gret inviting us, and if we have
a good enough season next year,
there’s an excellent chance for a
return trip.’/’

Although the football season is.

George's busiest time, the multi-
tude of winter athletics occupy a

' lot of his hours. He considers Rex

Peery the top wrestling coach in

the cmuntry and .is ..disappoi,nte.d:
I t “fails ‘to

and keeping the boys

make «use. of .,ath1,etic..si ;,is .to ,-. par-

 

support the sport as it should. “In
fact,” George admitted, “the
WPIAL fans who come here to

_see their games could really give

Pitt students lessons on how to
cheer.” _

He feels an occasional basket-
ball-wr_estling or basketball-
gymnastics double-header would
boost attendance and create in-
terest in so-called “minor”
sports. ’ ‘

George is looking forward to
the day that a swimming pool
will be added to the Field House,
and the swimming team can move
its meets from the P.A.A. where
they are now held.

He feels’ more students shoyld
participate in various athletics.
“After all, these sports are for
the students and the best way to

Sowell Leads‘ Dashmen;

Field Events

Look Weak I

By JOHN FAY
Coach, Carl Olson’s thinclads open the outdoor track
season at the Stadium Saturday at 1:00 p.m. when they face
Army in a dual meet. Arnie Sowell will lead the team as he
has done since he arrived on the Blue and Gold track scene

three years ago.

Sowell has just completed his most successful indoor
season which found him running various middle distance A 7‘

events ‘along with anchoring the nation’s most successful two-

mile relay team.

In the Knights of Columbus meet in Cleveland, Sowell

ran a 2:1l.0 in the 1000-yard run to break the former meet

record by one-tenth of a second.¢

It was a customary situation to
ﬁnd Sowell taking the baton in
the two-mile relay event with a
twenty-yard deﬁcit only to blaze
around the track and lead the
march to the tape. In the IC4A
meet in New York, the team broke
the relay record with a 7:400 time.

Relay Team Sets Record

Running in the Milwaukee
Journal meet, the relay team ran
the fastest time of the indoor sea-
son while breaking the meet rec-
ord in 7 :35.2 which was less than
two seconds slower than the world
record. Sowell made up twenty-

Great Sports Towns
Missing The Boat

By ED BACHMAN

 

1 Bethany - First .Oppositio11

For Panther Tennismen

Coach Jim Tully sends his 1956 edition of the Panther
tennis squad into a 14 match schedule when his netmen
open the season by traveling to Bethany, W. Va., April
18, to oppose the Bethany Bisons. '

News Editor

It seems that someone in this city is missing the boat.
9 In a town which has long been considered a great sports

town, attendance at athletic events is slipping. And no one.
7‘ knows what to do about it, so it seems.
The situation here at Pitt is far from the desperation

position, but actually we do have worries. Of prime con-
cern is 'the basketball attendance for the past season. In a

G...

year which has seen the Panthers floor one of their top

squads in many a year, the crowds at the ‘Field House have
remained low. Pitt has had a fairly attractive schedule,
A and still has won 60% of their games. '

 

I , But do we have the populous ﬁghting to get in to
see‘ some of these games? No, far from it. Instead of ,
attracting crowds totaling in the thousands, we’ve had

toosettle at times for merely a

 I: few hundred. . .

We’ve got a Field House 0
which we can be roud, even
1 though it'is small by some big-
nschool standards. But how many
ilnes have there been full houses
there this past winter? Just three
times. One time was’ when‘ Pitt
tangled with Duquesne for the
Steel Bowl championship last De-
cember. Another time was the
West Virginia game here. And the
.3 third time was during the recent
. WPIAL . basketball tournament.
That’s_ not a very good record of
_ '_ which to boast.

The other Pittsburgh colleges
,' . aren’t-‘burning up any attendance
records, either. Carnegie Tech,
-playing for the fun of it, draws
1 ‘fair crowds, but in a small gym.
I‘ .'And Duquesne, facing the end of

   
       
  
   

has had very «poor turnouts. This
despite the. presence of the fab-
 ulous Si.Green-
 that officials on the Bluﬁ’ aren’t
‘"..licking their lips over prospects
’ of big crowds watching them next
 year; -» —
' _ So kwhere’s the solution? It’s
‘ - right’"where it’s,been‘ for the past
V -few years. Up on the hill in the

ler was upset for the IF pres_i-
dency by Reed Harper of Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity.
Harper was ordinarily associ-

ated with' the Panther Party, but_

he was approached by the All-
Pitt Party, who told him that they
would support him for president.
The All-Pitts insist they backed
Harper because he was “the best

‘man,” but the Panthers think the

All-Pitts were manuevering poli-
tically.
Peake Questions

“When Dr. Peake (newly-ap-
pointed assistant chancellor to
student affairs) was here,” Cun-
ningham said, “one of the things
he asked me was how much self-
discipline do the fraternities have.
I told him that IF will soon adopt
a proposal for a Judicial Board,
but I shuddered when I said it,
because I don’t know just how a
self-discipline program would
work in IF with the politica1vsit»u-
ation as it is.”

. Cunningham was referring to
a proposed IF bill that is in com-
mittee. The bill, which would
ask for the creation of a Judici-
ary Board, is expected to be ap-

- proved at Wednesday’s meeting

‘of IF at the Sigma Pi house. It
was to have been approved at
the last IF meeting, but the bill’s

President, was unable to attend
the meeting due to illness.
Meanwhile, the two fraternity
party presidents, Ted Jamison of
the All-Pitt Party and Lynn Wat-

son of the Panther Party indicat-'

  

ed that they were willing to think . -

in terms of integration. .
Jamison revealed that he and
Watson had “discussed” integra-
tion, but didn’t “reach any con-
clusions.”
“It seems to me,” Jamison said,

“that we should unite now al-.

though iI.don’t think the danger  I‘ “

of the independent movement is
eminent now, but it may be next
year or the year after that they
become a power.”

Watson thought that Cunning- "

ham’s warning was “very much

in order” because it is “inevitable 
that the two factions will have to .

divorce politics from IF.”

“So far as associating more
closely with the other party,”
Watson continued, “We have no
objections about working .. along

with them, but on the other hand, 

we" will always be interested in

supporting the_ best men for, IE‘-

offices.”
