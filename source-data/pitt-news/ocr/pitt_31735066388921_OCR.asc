Dance Marathon raises over

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

The Dance Marathon, the first
event in Pitt's 1988 Greek Week,
raised $38,010 for the Western
Pennsylvania School for Blind
Children, almost twice as much

as last year.
”This was the best Dance
Marathon I've seen in four

years,” said co—overaII chairper-
son Lee Brody. ”The chairmen
for the event [Dance Marathon]
did a great job coordinating the
whole thing.”

"Bill [Breitenbach, the other
Dance Marathon chairperson]
and I have been working since
November,” said Susan Morrow,
co-chairperson of the marathon.
”|t's been a lot of work. Just in the
last month did things all of a sud-

den fall into place.”

The event started Friday even-
ing at 6 p.m. and ended 24 hours
later at 6 p.m. on Saturday.

"You should have seen them at
around eight [Saturday] morn-

_ing," said Brigitte Guernsey, the

Greek advisor. ”That was the
hard time."

Most of the dancers agreed that
the early morning hours were the
toughest point of the event.

"Around six in the morning, I
felt like my body was ready to
quit,” said Norma Bielich, a
junior in Chi Omega sorority.

"Three or four in the morning
was rough," said sophomore Eric
Ring of Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternity.

”At 8 a.m. you just feel like lay-
ing down wherever you are and
sleeping," said Frank Costanzo,

"In a court of law, a two—bit
thief has the same rights and
powers as the federal govern-
ment," said Tim O'Brien,
Supreme Court correspondent for
ABC, at a lecture sponsored by
the Honors College on Friday.

O'Brien, who has covered the
Court for over eight years, was
describing the value of the
Gideon decision, handed down
25 years ago Friday, which gave
all people accused of a felony the
right to have a lawyer, regardless
of their ability to pay.

”The legal system has gotten so

complex,” he said, "that it would
be unfair to expect the average
person to defend himself against
the state, with its huge resource
of money and people.”

Although he recognizes that
there are some problems with the
current state of the Supreme
Court, among which is the in-
creasing politicization of
nominees, he said that the court
works, and works well.

The Supreme Court has the last
word in legal matters, during their
life-long appointments; the
justices are called upon to-inter-
pret the intent of a sometimes am-
biguous document, the
Constitution.

a sophomore from Delta Tau Del-
ta fraternity.

But with dinner, breakfast and
lunch provided by Roy Rogers,
and occasional 10 to 15 minute
rest breaks, the dancers kept up
momentum. Several events were
designed to keep dancers moti-
vated, including the giving away
of two round-trip tickets to Mia-
mi, Fla.

”At first I was doing it for the
fraternity, so we could get the
points,” said Ring, the winner of
the two tickets. "But it is a worth-
while cause and it's fun, because
you're with all of your friends in
the Greek system. You feel like
you're doing something good —
but the tickets really helped.”

"We tried to set up a point sys-
tem that we thought would be
unreachable,” said Morrow.

”There are situations that the
framers couldn't have envis-
ioned, and the Court has to make
some sort of judgement,"
O'Brien said. "[The] Justices
should be bound by the Consti-
tution, but given considerable
leeway."

He cited the recent questions
about the validity and fairness of
the death penalty heavily in his
remarks about the value of "origi-
nal intent.”

"The punishments that were
acceptable when the‘Constitution
was drafted, the screw and the
rack, would never be accepted
today. I think the framers would
allow for a changing definition of

$38,000 ‘

"One house managed to turn in
$6,000. [The] $38,000 [total] was
just unbelievable.”

"The [Dance Marathon] just
gets better every year," said
Guernsey. "There are more peo-
ple. But the big difference this
year was that it was held in the
Student Union instead of Soldiers
and Sailors."

This is the first time that this
event was held in the Union. It
is also the first time in years that
the marathon was held at the be-
ginning of Greek Week instead of
the end.

"I liked [the Dance Marathon]
better this year,” said Bielich,
who participated in another
marathon two years ago. ’’I liked
the room better. It was more like
a party.”

speaks about justice

what was cruel and unusual.

"You also have to remember,"
he continued, "when this coun-
try started, only 25 percent of the
white males were eligible to vote.
Obviously, you have to take that
into consideration.”

The framers were leading
proponents of human rights in
their time. If they were alive to-
day, O'Brien said, there is no rea-
son to assume that they still
would not be at the forefront.

"I think Justice Brennen has
come the closest to describing the
purpose of the Court. He said that
the court had to be guided by a
respect for human dignity."

Panama
Canal

stays
open

By Richard Cole

Associated Press Writer

PANAMA CITY, Panama —
When strikes shut down the rest
of the country, Panama Canal
employees went to work. When
flaming barricades blocked
downtown streets, roads to the
canal were clear. The crisis grip-
ping the rest of the country has
barely touched the waterway so
vital to Panama's economy.

Even at the height of this
week's protests, rioters demand-
ing the ouster of strongman Gen.

Manuel Antonio Noriega avoid-‘

ed the canal zone just outside the
capital.

Canal officials said the most
serious problem was a transit
stoppage that made it impossible
for many canal employees to get
to work. =

After last Wednesday's failed
coup attempt and street riots, the
joint U.S.—Panamanian commis-
sion that has governed the canal
since 1979 issued a reassuring
statement.

"We expect surface transit to
continue without interruption,"
said the canal’s marine director,
George Hull.

But not everyone agrees.

Capt. John Maher, president of
the 230-member Panama Canal
Pilots Association, said continued
political instability could sound
the waterway’s death knell.

Shipbuilders are already plan-
ning for the year 2000, when
Panama takes full control of the
waterway, he explained, and they
must decide now whether new
fleets will be small enough to fit
through the l10—foot-wide lock
chambers.

The association pilots guide
ships large and small through the
canal, its locks and other instal-
Iations.

Maher fears that if builders
have doubts about the canal’s fu-
ture, they will opt to build larger
ships. About 1,800 ships world-
wide are already too big to pass
through the locks.

An average of 33 ships a day
pass through the S0-mile set of
locks and lakes. Canal officials
said 37 made the trip the day of
the coup attempt and 39 passed
through the next day, despite
work stoppages at ports on both
sides of the waterway.

Even the power outages that
plagued the rest of the country

IRA mob murders British soldiers at funeral

BELFAST, Northern Ireland --
Two British soldiers who were
killed in a brutal attack by an an-
gry mob ignored orders to stay
away from an Irish Republican
Army funeral procession, the Brit-
ish army said Sunday.

All soldiers in the British—ruled
province were told that the funer-
al was taking place on Saturday
and had been warned to steer
clear, an army spokesman said.
He said the army had begun an
investigation.

"The two corporals should not
have been where they were, and
we are interested in examining
how that came about," said the
spokesman, speaking anony-
mously in keeping with British
custom.

”They would have been
briefed about the route of the
funeral procession, and the two
corporals were not expected to
be there and had no requirement
to be there."

Cpl. Derek Wood, 24, and Cpl.
David Howes, 23, were shot
dead in Belfast on Saturday after
funeral mourners dragged them

from their unmarked car, beat
them unconscious and stripped
them naked.

The outlawed IRA claimed
responsibility for the deaths and
the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's police force,
said it was questioning three
people.

”The thought of these two sold-
iers being savagely beaten and
then shot in cold blood will give
rise to feelings of revulsion in ev-
ery Irish man or woman who has
a spark of human feeling,” said
Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, head of
the Roman Catholic church in
Ireland.

Both soldiers belonged to the
Royal Corps of Signals, a regi-
ment often engaged in highly
secret monitoring of communi-
cations.

municipal elections after explo-
sions ripped through the capital
and sabotage knocked out pow-
er to much of the nation.

Early turnout was moderate,
without long lines at polling
places in the capital. There were
some organizational difficulties,
including late delivery of ballot
boxes to some voting stations and
arguments over the placement of
party observers at tables where
registrations were checked.

The entire capital was without
electricity after leftist guerrillas
blew up transmission towers out-
side the city. The outage meant
that virtually no one in the city
had running water, as the state-
owned utility's pumps run on
electricity.

The outage knocked almost all
radio stations off the air. Only the
army’s Radio Cuscatlan, which
has a powerful generator, was

broadcasting news.

[Telephone calls to local radio
reporters around the country
showed that guerrillas had
knocked out power in II of El
Salvador’s 14 provinces.

UFOs sighted inside
China near airplane

BEIJING -— Passengers on two
flights to Xinjiang, China's north-
westernmost province, reported
UFO sightings, an official report
said Sunday.

The state-run Xinhua News
Agency said a passenger on a
flight from Beijing to Urumqi, the
provincial capital, last Friday
sighted the unidentified flying ob-
ject to the right in front of the
plane at 9:35 p.m.

When the flight crew contact-
ed local airports, they were told
there was no plane in the area at
that time.

The object was described as
being about the size of a basket-
ball and sending out a beam like
a searchlight. The crew sent a
light signal to the object, which

Pittsburgh Marathon
offers more than just
a competitive race

 

By Mark R. Brown

Staff Writer

The Oakland Business and Civ-
ic Association is looking for .run—
ners to participate in the
Pittsburgh._Ma(.athon on May 1.

Karen Stahl, spokesperson for
OBCA, said, ”We’re forming an
informal Oakland team to run in
the Marathon. Students, residents
or anyone employed in Oakland
are welcome.”

”The fee for entering the Mara-
thon is $15. Our Oakland team
will have their own distinctive
singlet to wear in addition to the
Marathon shirt,” said Kathleen
Miller, a member of the OBCA
planning staff.

The Pittsburgh Marathon is ten-
tatively scheduled to kick off an
hour after the Women's Olympic
Trials, which will draw some of
the best female runners nation-
wide. The top three women run-
ners will be selected for the U.S.
Olympic team.

”Oakland is about halfway on
the 26—mile course. The runners
will cross the Birmingham Bridge
and negotiate the only challeng-
ing hill on the course — up
Forbes Avenue —— hang a left on
Craig Street, then right on Fifth
Avenue," said Richard St. John,
also with OBCA.

"Presby Hospital is furnishing
the medical support for the race,

and will be maintaining a fitness
stop and aid station in Oakland,”
Miller said.

The main focus of OBCA plan-
ning is on creating a festival at-
mosphere so that people can
enjoy themselves.

”The race will not be boring;
it will be more like a fair,” said
Miller.

”We’re really targeting families
to enjoy themselves," said Stahl.

”Tentatively, we're looking at
having bands, jugglers and
clowns along the race route.
Given the large variety of activi-
ties in Oakland on May 1 —— a
graduation, people moving in the
dorms for the summer and the
Olympic trials — Oakland is go-
ing to put on a show. The theme
of, ‘Oakland — A World Within
a City,’ is something that we can
be proud of,” Miller added.

"We're encouraging people to
come out and have a good time.
The diversity of people in Oak-
land is spectacular, and our run-
ning team, support crew and
spectators will show this of,”
said Miller.

In addition, van tours of Oak-
land and events for children are
planned. Tours of the Nationali-
ty Rooms will be conducted.
Parking will be available at the
Forbes-Semple Garage and at the
Medical Arts Garage. KDKA—TV
will be covering the race.

The 350th Anniversary of
Swedish and Finnish coloniza-
tion was celebrated Saturday
night at Duranti's Park Plaza
Restaurant in Oakland.

The event, which included
traditional Scandinavian mus-
ic and cuisine, was sponsored
by the University of Pittsburgh
Swedish and Finnish National-
ity Rooms Committees and the
Scandinavian Society of South-
western Pennsylvania.

The dinner celebrated the
first Swedish-Finnish colony,
established in 1638 in New
Delaware, and is the first of
many events soon to be held
nationwide.

Finns, Swedes mark 350 years

During the evening, the au-
dience was addressed by Dr.
Ralph Jalkanen, President of
Sumi [Finnish] College, in
Hancock, Mich.

Jalkanen focused on the
hardships that many of the
colonists experienced in the
new world. 1

Depicting their saga, Jalka-
nen gave accounts of attacks
by Indians, severe sickness
and ethnic prejudice against
the Swedish and Finnish
people. ’

Jalkanen made comparisons
between the different facets of
Swedish and Finnish culture. '

”The Swedes are a culture
of contrast,” ‘said’ Jalkanen.’
”They move in several differ-
ent directions; they are the

freest of all cultures in the
West. While they practice
neutrality, for over 100 years
their military roots were se-
cond to none.

“The country takes care of a
[person] from the cradle to the
grave,” Jalkanen said of
Sweden's economic system.
”Sweden is a welfare state on
one side while capitalist on
the other.”

Jalkanen, jokingly quoting
Will Rogers, said/‘Finnish is
such a difficult language even
the Finns speak Swedish."

In closing, Jalkanen said that
Swedish and Finnish coloniza-
tion was unique because it fo-
cused on the value of family
life. i

Obviously, from the number
and content of the various
amendments to the Constitution,
that definition is changing.

”To me,” he said, ”[changing
human rights] is the best argu-
ment so far for not following the
actual wording of the Constitu-

tion. There are some important
things that just aren't there.”

Answering questions from the
audience, O'Brien made some
predictions about cases current-
ly in the court system:

The legality of independent
counsels: It will be decided that

independent counsels violate the
separation of powers in the Con-
stitution, but Lawrence Walsh
[Iran-Contra investigator] will be
able to use the evidence he has
accumulated.

Reagan will pardon them after the

will help you do what is called a
”neat trick” —— something on the
face of it, hard to do.

That neat trick is not to worry
about what worries you at the
very time it worries you the most.
That is a neat trick, yes, but that
sex therapist, listening to you and
considering how to proceed with
your special and individual
problem, will have you forgetting
the worry that is blocking you
from the fullest pleasure.

doctor mentioned that there are

older men with their sexual per-
formance. They showed an im-
plant device that can be inflated
‘to create an erection and lasts as
long as it is needed — then it is
deflated after the couple have
both been satisfied. The doctor
said to consult a good urologist.

A: That doctor said the right
thing. If you are personally in-
terested, you have to consult a
urologist, and it should be a good
urologist. This isnot a thing a

Evans, Smith, Gore: , ,

Pitt's loss to Vanderbilt yesterday in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament stung all of those who are associated with
the Pitt program. But the loss could not have hurt anyone more
than seniors Charles Smith and Demetreus Gore.

Smith and Core have seen both the highs and lows of col-
legiate competition in their four years at Pitt. To see their careers
end with such a shocking loss is nothing less than a bitter dis-
appointment. But Smith and Gore can still take pride in the
many achievements Pitt's program has enjoyed during their stay

at the university.

Under the leadership of Paul Evans, Pitt has had two straight
successful seasons, albeit seasons that were tainted because of
two successive early exits from the NCAA Tournament. But that
does not lessen the impact Pitt has had on the collegiate basket-
ball scene. And Smith and Gore were a large part of the Pan-
thers' rise to national prominence.

Smith's individual ability brought national attention to the
school, and he parlayed his abilities into many victories for the
Panthers. Gore, although never receiving the accolades Smith
did, had a solid career on the court.

Due to an impressive freshman class and the hopeful return
of Jerome Lane and Rod Brookin, the future of Pitt basketball

is bright.

No one should forget that Smith and Gore are a major rea-
son why Pitt’s program is regarded as one of the best in the

nation.

First, everyone complained that
the United States was wasting
millions of dollars by supplying
the Contras with the necessities
of war. Nobody seemed to care
that Nicaragua was a Marxist-
Leninist government receiving
aid from the Soviet Union.

Second, everyone was upset
with Reagan because he was the
prime advocator of supplying the
Contras with everything they
needed. This resulted with the
Republican-sponsored Contra—aid
bill's being canned in the House.

Third, the Democrats’ Contra-
aid plan was shot down in the
House two weeks ago because
everything seemed to be peace-
ful down in Nicaragua, and no-
body saw the need to give the
Contras more money to wage
war if Ortega and company were
being nice guys.

Surprise. The instant Contra’

funding ran out, the Sandinistas
attacked. It's strange, but hadn't

Each March, I make a modest
safari through the fashion maga-
zines to see what new ways they
have to decorate the species. My
harbinger-of-spring tour through
this designer world usually picks
up a little news. This year, the
message is positively minimal:
Less is more.

The skirt rose last autumn; the
bodice is falling this spring. There
are holes and cut—outs, ruffles and
roses in all the wrong places.
Women are bursting out of what
isn't barely stretched over. And
the copywriters are also bursting
— with enthusiasm for the new
sexiness.

The new sexiness? If I had
bought stock in fashion futures, I
would have put my money on a
very different costume. This has
been touted as a more sexually
conservative era. Women are not
just being warned of the dangers
of sex; in many ways, they're be-
ing asked again to take on the
role of sexual controller.

The high fashionables,
however, seem to be contrarians.
Everybody’s running for cover, so

they sell exposure. The same
women who are being told to
buy condoms and caution are be-
ing marketed decolletage in

is there something going on
here? Just say no, but dress for
yes? Are we witnessing a"revival
of a truly retro style? The Return
of the Tease.

Those born after 1950 may
have only dim memories of the
stock female figure of the pre-
(sexual)-revolution era. The tease
was the girl who promised him
anything, but gave him less. On
the high-school scale of things,
being called a tease was only a
notch or two better than being
called a slut or, for that matter,
frigid. And it was boys who gave
out the labels.

The tease was the double mes-
senger of the double standard of
mid-century America. In the earli-
er Victorian era, women were
presented as rather sexless crea-
tures, meant to appeal to a flesh-
less virtue. By the 19505
however, a woman was sup-
posedto negotiate a much tricki-

er path. She was supposed to be
sexually attractive without being
sexually active.

Success demanded that you
lure a man; safety, that you keep
him away. This was to be care-
fully managed. Sexual favors
were to be dispensed in a timely
fashion, coordinated with varsity
sweaters and ID bracelets, frater-
nity pins and diamonds. Men
were to press, women to resist.
The path was to lead inexorably

"hawks" been fortelling that that
would happen if aid was cut off?
Didn't anybody who voted
against the bills consider the im-
plications of their decision to end
aid to the Contras?

The Contras had been using
our money to fight their war to
oust the Sandinista government
and install some sort of a
democratic government.

Now that the Contras will no
longer ' be receiving U.S.
weapons, they won't be able to
continue fighting the Sandinistas.
The Hondurans aren't too
pleased that the Nicaraguans in-
vaded their country to attack the
Contras, so they asked the Unit-
ed States to intervene in some

fashion i

to the altar where, magically,
wives were to be transformed
into eager partners.

Not every young woman could
maneuver this path so perfectly.
Some promised too much or gave
too little. And some of these
women were labeled teases.
”The tease” itself may have come
from her angora sweater, her
walk or her laugh. The label
might have been dispensed by a
male out of his frustration, his
anger or his confusion.

Novels and movies, humorous
or bitter, were written by '50s
men who felt manipulated by
women. But the tease was the
product of an era when the con-
sequences of unmarried sex —
pregnancy — were disastrous.

Today, the one thing that sur-
vived the sexual revolution,
locked in deep storage, is this no-
tion of women as agent of sexual
control. This is another era when
the consequences of teenage sex
— pregnancy -~' and "casual" sex
—- AIDS —— are seen as disastrous.

The campaign to just say ”no”
is directed at girls. It is assumed

What did the United States do?
It sent soldiers —— Americans — to

Honduras. Their mission isn't to‘

engage the Sandinista forces, but
rather to sit there and look tough
with the hopes of scaring the San-
dinistas back into Nicaragua be-
fore the Honduran Army finds
itself in a full—fledged war to pro-
tect their territorial integrity.

Did any of the people who vot-
ed against the Contra—aid bill ever
think that American troops would
be sent to Central America to pro-
tect the Contras when the Contras
lost the ability to protect them-
selves? Probably not. Did anyone
ever consider that the United
States might be forced to fight the
Sandinistas to save the Contras?

God forbid that the United
States, the so-called land of the
free, should provide money to
groups of people in other nations
to fight oppressive regimes when
we can send in our own soldiers
to fight for them.

ndustry

that boys are pressuring them.
The campaign among heterosex-
uals for condoms and caution has
also been directed at women. But
so is the notion that they must
continue to appear sexy while be-
having safely.

It isn't just fashions — to wear
and bare .—— that are sold on sex.
Every shampoo carries the mes-
sage that you can wash that man
right into your life. The senti-
ments abound. To fail to sexual-
ly attract a man is to be lonely.
To succeed is to be endangered.

Women are urged back to their
posts as the traffic cops of sexu-
ality. This time they’re expected
to push the red and green lights
at the same time. What better
setup for the return of the late and
unlamented tease?

When you go looking for an
outfit for the sexually conserva-
tive era, something special for the
safer-sex ball, skip the high
fashion glossies. They haven't got
a thing to wear.

Newton's Law
Commodores defy the ods, upset Panthers, 80-74

By The Associated Press

LINCOLN, Neb. —- When Will
Perdue fouled out and his team
trailed No. 8 Pittsburgh by one
point with four seconds left in
regulation, Vanderbilt coach
C.M. Newton told his 7-foot
senior not to worry, his playing
days weren't over.

Guard Barry Coheen made his
coach a prophet. Goheen hit two
3-pointer jumpers in the final 17
seconds to send the game into
overtime, and Vanderbilt outlast-
ed Pittsburgh 80-74 in an NCAA
Midwest Regional quarterfinal
Sunday.

‘ 

Their intensity picked
up, plus we got out of
our offense and started
taking the shots early.

—— Paul Evans

Perdue’s fifth foul came against
Pitt standout Charlie Smith, who
made both free throws for a
69-66 lead. But Goheen’s last-
second jumper evened the score
as time ran out.

”The big thing is the team
proved we can play without me
in the game,” said Perdue, the
Southeastern Conference's play-
er of the year. ”This isn't a one-
man show. If one guy fouls out,
we don't fold."

When Perdue went to the
bench, Newton said: ’’I told him,
‘Your playing days aren't over.
We’re going to win it.’ ”

Goheen wasn't as confident.
He said he hoped Smith wouldn't
make both free throws ”so we
wouldn’t need a 3-pointer to tie.”

”When he made them both, all
we could do was go down and
take the best shot we could," G0-
heen said. ’’I was fortunate to get
as good a shot as I did, and for-
tunately, it went in.”

”We were hoping to foul him,”
Pitt Coach Paul Evans said. "We
couldn't catch up with him.”

Vanderbilt scored the first six
points in the overtime, including
a free throw from Goheen and a
3-pointer by Barry Booker. The
Commodores never lost the lead
in the extra period as Goheen ad-
ded four more free throws.

Santoro wins NCAA tournament

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt All—American Pat Santoro
beat Edinboro’s Sean O’Day
Saturday night to take the
142-pound NCAA championship
in Ames, Iowa.

Santoro dominated the match
from the beginning to defeat
O’Day, 16-11.

The match, telecast live by
ESPN, was typical Santoro. He

Coheen had 22 points as Van-
derbilt, 20-10, advanced to the
Midwest Regional semifinals in
Pontiac, Mich., Friday against the
Kansas, a 61-58 winner over Mur-
ray State. ‘

Pitt, 24-7, led by as many as 13
points midway through the first
half as Jerome Lane scored eight
and Smith, six. Lane also had 10
rebounds as Pitt held a 23-12 re-
bounding edge by the half.

Smith entered the game need-
ing 10 points to top the Pitt career
scoring record of 2,033 set by
Clyde Vaughn, from 1980-84.
The 6-foot—10 senior went past
Vaughn’s mark on a slam dunk
with 15:52 left in the game.

Smith finished his Pitt career
with 2,045 points.

Vanderbilt, which finished
fourth in the Southeastern Confer-
ence, rallied behind Booker’s
seven points and 1 1 from Perdue
to pull even at 34 at halftime.

”We were so tight, it was un-
believable,” Newton said of the
first half. ”Once we realized we
could just go out and play, we
played and played pretty well.”

”Their intensity picked up, plus
we got out of our offense and
started taking the shots early,”
Evans said. ”Our big kids were
out—running them early but they
slowed down. I guess they got
tired."

Smith and Demetreus Gore
scored six points each in the first
eight minutes of the second half
to boost Pitt back to a 48-43 lead
but Gore picked up his fourth
foul and went to the bench with
12:02 to play.

The lead changed hands sever-
al more times until Pitt went up
64-61 at 2:03 on two Darelle
Porter jumpers.

After a missed shot and Lane
rebound, Smith was fouled by
Perdue with 17 seconds to play.
Smith made the first free throw,
missed the second but came up
with the loose rebound when
Lane tipped the ball out of Per-
due’s hands.

Pitt's Jason Matthews was
fouled with 12 seconds left and
made both ends of a one-and-one
for a 67-63 lead.

Goheen hit a 3-pointer from
the corner to make it a 67-66
game with six seconds left.

Perdue fouled Smith on the in-
bounds play and Smith hit both
ends of the one-and-one, but Go-
heen put up a 21-footer with one
second left and sent the game

came running out in the first peri-
od with his head down and went
to work. For the rest of the match,
Santoro continued to look deter-
mined and ready for action.

Santoro took O’Day down to
score the first points of the match,
and there was no looking back.

”[Winning the NCAA champi-
onship] has been a goal of mine
since last year,” Santoro said in
Sunday's Pittsburgh Press. ”I was
real nervous when I went out, but

into overtime tied at 69-69.

’’I thought they'd try to foul in
the back court,” Coheen said. ’’I
was pleased with the shot
selection.”

’’I can't really remember any-
body making as big a play as
those two,” Newton said of Go-
heen’s shots, ”not at this stage, in

I felt a lot less pressure than I did
in the semis.”

In the semifinals, Santoro got a
scare in a tight match with Carl
Monoco, a 3-2 win.

This is the fourth time that San-
toro has defeated O’Day this sea-
son. The last time was in the
National Wrestling Coaches As-
sociation All—Star Meet, 16-10.

Santoro has been ranked No. 1
all season by the Amateur
Wrestling News. He finishes the
season with a perfect 48-0 record.

such a crucial situation.”

Newton said his strategy in the
overtime was simple enough.
”Play. We got new life, play,” he
said. ”We were going to buy time
with the zone. All I was con-
cerned with was running that
clock and having a chance to
win.”

In the first round, Santoro
pulled a technical fall over Boise
State's Randy Schimel, 19-3. He
pinned Ohio State's Ken Ramsey
in the second round at the 2:10
mark.

Santoro reacted to the win in a
different way than other winners
did. Instead of jumping up with
his fist raised, he simply walked
off the mat.

It was just another day at the
office.

As if making it to the first
ArenaBow| wasn't enough, Pitts-
burgh Gladiator head coach Joe
Haering wants more.

He wants the whole thing.

”We'd like to get the title and
bring it to Pittsburgh,” said Haer-
ing, who will also serve as the
team's general manager.

”Maybe, looking back on it,
[losing] was a blessing in disguise
because it's going to drive our
staff even harder,” he added.

The Gladiators lost to the Den-
ver Dynamites 45-16 in last sea-
son's ArenaBowl, which was
held at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena.
The experimental sport had the
best support from fans in Pitts-
burgh, as opposed to fan support
from the league's other cities:

Denver, Washington and
Chicago.

Last season, the league played
six regular season games with the
top two teams playing for the
championship. This year,
however, the success of
Arenaball has made expansion a
reality, as the league will now
have six teams, with each team
playing 12 games.

Denver's squad has moved to
Los Angeles (Cobras) while
Washington has moved to Detroit
(Drive). The Chicago Bruisers are
the team remaining in the league,
while the New England (Provi-
dence) Steamrollers and the New
York Knights join the conference.

With one year under their belt
and a drive to be the best in
1988, Haering would like to get
the local products to play. The
team will retain the rights of the

players from last year's team and
can add 12 territorial picks.

”We have the rights to all state
schools .. which includes Pitt
and Penn State  and anyone in
a 75-mile radius of Pittsburgh,”
said Haering. ”Anyone who was
active and played three games for
the Cleveland Browns or Pitts-
burgh Steelers — we have the
rights to the replacement players.

”Pittsburgh is great for support.
If we can find these local players
from the schools, that should
help, because we didn't have that
last year. We could get some
players from Pitt,” Haering
added.

The league brings in 50 play-
ers for the six teams to draft, but
teams must cut their rosters from
35 to 18 by April 20.

In other happenings:

0 Haering named Mike McKib-

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 21, 1988

Temple and RI proving A-10 not so weak

Prior to the 1988 NCAA Tour-
nament, there was no clear-cut
favorite for the national title, nor
any teams ready to wear Cin-
derella’s shoes.

But now that the first and se-
cond rounds of the tournament
are complete, things are starting
to fall into place.

0 Despite placing six teams in
this year’s tourney, the Big East
has not fared well. Five teams —
Pitt, Syracuse, St. John's, Geor-

getown and Seton Hall .—i were .
eliminated from title contention

this past weekend.

Only Villanova has won its first A

two games, defeating Arkansas
82-74 on Friday and Illinois
66-63 Sunday afternoon. I

Suprisingly, it was the Atlantic 5

10 Conference that dealt the
deadliest blow to the Big East.
Generally regarded as a much
weaker conference, the A-10 has
sent both of its representatives to
the Sweet Sixteen.

Upstart Rhode Island, which
lost wvo games to lowly Du-
quesne in the regular season, up-

set Syracuse 97-94 on Saturday to
become the first team to advance
to the Final 16.

URI used stellar play from
guards Tom Garrick and Carlton
”Silk” Owens to nullify the
Orangemen’s potent inside
game, fouling out Derrick Cole-
man and Stephen Thompson,
and neutralizing Rony Seikaly
and Derek Brower with four fouls
each.

Top-ranked Temple, also an

A-10 team, belted Georgetown,‘

74-53, on Sunday. The loss was
Georgetown’s worst in tourna-

* ment history.

St. John's never made it past the
firstround, losing 62-59 to Flori-
da on Thursday at Salt Lake City.

Late season bloomer Seton Hall
handed Texas El-Paso a ticket
home after an 80-64 victory, but
the‘Pirates season ended with an
'84-55 loss to powerful Arizona
yesterday.

And Big East regular-season
champion Pitt could not hold off
a late-game Vanderbilt rally,
bowing to the Commodores

MA'I"I'
MARTIN

80-74 in overtime.

0 Pitt’s loss marked the end of
an era for the Panthers as seniors
Charles Smith and Demetreus
Gore played their last game in the
familiar blue and gold uniforms.

Smith leaves as the all-time
leading scorer in Pitt history with
2,045 points and is only the se-
cond Pitt player to score more
than 2,000 points in his career.
Clyde Vaughan scored 2,033
points.

0 The Richmond Spiders have
turned out to be the real suprise
team of the tournament, defeat-
ing defending national champion
Indiana, 72-69, on Friday and up-
ending Georgia Tech 59-55 in
their second-round game Sunday.

The Spiders will have their
hands full next weekend,
however, when they face off
against national power Temple in

Hoyas out of tournament

By Howard Ulman
AP Sports Writer

HARTFORD, Conn. —- Top-
ranked Temple, one of the na-
tion’s best defensive teams,
forced Georgetown into its worst
shooting performance of the sea-
son Sunday.

The Owls, led by Mark Macon
and Mike Vreeswyk, outscored
Georgetown 15-6 in the first nine
minutes of the second half and
rolled to a 74-53 NCAA East
Regional second-round victory.

The Hoyas trailed 30-26 at half-
time but hit only three of their
first 15 second-half shots while
Temple was making five of eight
to build a 45-32 lead with 11:15
left in the game. Macon had six
points and Vreeswyk five in the
surge.

”When you're playing a great
team like this,” Georgetown
coach John Thompson said, ”you
can't afford to make mistakes.”

The Hoyas did, primarily in try-
ing to locate the basket.

”Ramon did a good job on the
inside,” Vreeswyk said. ”He
didn't allow them many second
chances.”

”They have thunder and light-
ning on that team,” Thompson
said. ”The big kid [Rivas] is tough
inside and Macon can run around
and do things on the outside 
I think he's one of the best play-
ers in America."

Temple, 31-1, carries a
17-game winning streak into
Thursday's regional semifinal at

East Rutherford, N.l., against the
Richmond Spiders, who defeated
Georgia Tech to advance.

The Owls, champions of the
Atlantic 10, had lost in the sec-
ond round in each of the last four
seasons, including 1985 to Geor-
getown, the 1984 national
champion.

Temple, whose lead ranged
from 10 to 22 points during the
last 11 minutes, was led by Ma-
con and Vreeswyk with 21 points
each.

the East Regional semifinals.
0 Iowa's 104-86 victory over
1987 Final Four competitor

University of Nevada-Las Vegas '

was a stunning turnaround from
last year’s game between the
same two teams. UNLV was
down by 18 points at one time,
but rallied to defeat the
Hawkeyes and advance to the Fi-
nal Four, only to lose to eventual
national champion Indiana.

0 Michigan and Maryland, two
teams that will probably be tour-
nament competitors for at least
the next few years, both had im-
pressive showings this weekend.

Michigan, powered by All-
American guard Gary Grant and
one of the best inside games in
the country, struggled with open-
ing round opponent Boise State,
but won 63-58. No such luck for
Florida, the Wolverine’s second
round foes. Michigan jumped out
to an early lead and never looked
back en route to a 108-85 pound-
ing of Vernon Maxwell and the
Gators.

Maryland, which finished

17-12 in the regular season,‘
opened the tournament with a
92-82 victory over Cal-Santa Bar-
bara, which had defeated PCAA
rival UNLV twice during the year.
The Terrapins played valiantly in
their second round game against
Kentucky, but eventually were
ousted by the Wildcats 90-81.

Both Maryland and Michigan
are young squads, and this year’s
tournament experience can onl ’
benefit the ft'1'tij‘re of both“
programs.

0 Possibly the greatest display
of run-and-gun basketball in the
tournament, notwithstanding Ok-
lahoma, was Loyola-
Marymount’s 119-115 victory
over Wyoming on Thursday.

With the Lions averaging a shot
every seven seconds, it's no
wonder they were the country's
highest-scoring team this season.

The North Carolina Tarheels
did the Lions one better,

however, beating them at their ‘

own game with a 123-97 victory
Saturday. North Carolina will
face Michigan this weekend.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 21, 1988

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

Maybe it's because they've
been so bad for so long that the
Pittsburgh Pirates can't wait to tell
everybody how good they're go-
ing to be.

”We don't have a manufac-
tured enthusiasm in this club; we

ave real enthusiasm,” ' relief
iitcherlim Gottsaid. ”I just can't
see us not doing well, not con-
tending. We have a great combi-
nation of older guys and younger
guys who are hungry and have
something to prove."

The Pirates proved last season
that after three consecutive last-
place finishes in the National
League East, they no longer are
one of the worst teams in base-
ball. But whether they're now
ready to become one of the best
teams is questionable.

Thrift completed a roster over-
haul last season by trading near-
ly every veteran of value for

young talent, the Pirates won 27
of their last 38 games. They
finished 80-82 after winning only
58 games in 1985.

”They finally had something
for the highlight film," Manager
Jim Leyland said.

The Pirates not only escaped
last place for the first time since
1983 by tying Philadelphia for
fourth place, they apparently
rekindled an enthusiasm for base-
ball in a city that has long ignored
nearly every team except the
Steelers.

Preseason ticket sales are up
nearly 40 percent from a year ago
and the Pirates’ radio and televi-
sion commercials boast glowing-
ly about the turnaround,
proclaiming, ”Next year is final-
ly here.”

”But I've told our players that,
just like they didn't listen when
everybody told them how bad
they were, they shouldn't listen
when people tell them how good
they are,” Leyland said. ”We’re
getting close, but we're not there

yet. We still have a lot of work to
do.”

The Pirates have one of the best
collection of young pitchers in
baseball — ’’I think we've got a
gold mine,” pitching coach Ray
Miller said — but doesn't have a
pitcher who has won more than
13 major-league games.

Their middle defense is very
good, with Gold Glove catcher
Mike LaVaIliere, far—ranging sec-
ond baseman Jose Lind and sure-
handed Andy Van Slyke in center
field.

Barry Bonds, the streaky left
fielder, was the Pirates’ top pow-
er hitter with 25 homers, but bats
No. 1 because, ”This basically is
a team without a lead-off hitter,”
said Bonds. .

The Pirates also don't have a lot
of veterans with playoff ex-
perience —-— veteran pitcher Bob
Walk, 31, is their oldest player.

In addition to Catt, who saved
13 games after Aug. 3, Thrift’s
other late-season acquisitions —
after he dealt veterans such as Jim
