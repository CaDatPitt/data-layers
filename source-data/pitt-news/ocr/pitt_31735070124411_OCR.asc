In thelate 1970s, Pittsburgh and theiart _r

that students who study art aren’t even intro-

a recent graduate ﬁom Northwestern

University. “Glass or any of the‘ important

In an essay on display at the exhibit enti-

The _majority of artists on display at the

these glass artists have focused-on_ the tradi-

Marioni’s work is by farthe most tradi-

tional, with simple contrasting colors and

elegant: shapes formed using the Murini
technique. This technique comprises little
squares of glass fused together into a large
work of art. But not all of the artists mold

Berkovitz proposed the idea of a glass

an art medium was young and was emerging
on the art scene. Berkovitz wanted to expose
this artto thepublic.‘ t A — . .
The premier’ show was met with great

} successwhen it opened in 1981. It was host?

ed in theiGallery’s-ﬁrst location, on the 5800 
block of Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill.

In 1972 the Concept Art, Gallery moved — _

The young woman listening to the
music with her head on her boyfriend’s
shoulder didn’t need to understand the words
Urna sang. Language was not a great enough
barrier to block the emotion pouring through
the singer’s Voice.

Uma Chahar Tughci, Mongolian singer
and composer, performed “Songs from the
Grasslands” with her husband, Robert
Zollitsch, last- night at the Frick Fine Arts
auditorium to an audience of students, facul-
ty and members of the community.

Pitt’s department of music presented the
concert, which was sponsored by the Asian
studies department and Honors College.

The couple opened with “Taliin Juud,”
translated as “Dream of the Steppe.” The
translated lyrics are, “Flowers of the
Steppe/songs of joy/melodies of a happy
land/hymns of praise from young and old.”

All of Tughci’s songs are from her
native land. She was born and raised in rural
Mongolian farmland and collected folk
songs the people from that region sing. She
blends them with her own sound to create
music unique to her. 0 .

“In Mongolia, every song tells astory,”
Tughci said. She used her four—octave vocal

range to tell stories varying ﬁorn a monk"

Wearing a tradi-

Tughci sat on a red
chair, resting her right
arm on her crossed
legs and bracing her

the microphone com-

with her eyes closed.

‘Staff Writer

Thomas_ Braun, who has been‘

serving as interim dean of Pitt’s
school of. dental medicine since
January, was named tothe position.
permanently.

Braun, 52, replaced the contro-
versial Joe Suzuki, whose reportedly
abrasive style nearly caused a facul-
ty uprising during h'is five year
tenure.

“Dr. Braun has all the things
you’d look for in a dean,” said
Arthur Levine, senior vice chancel-
lor for the health sciences and dean
of the school of medicine.

“He’s proven himself to be a
great teacher,‘ clinician, researcher

and leader,” Levine said‘. “These

were the areas we were looking for
to take the school into the future.”

Braun was unavailable for com-
ment about-the promotion.

According tova University press
release, the Pittsburgh nativecarned
four degrees at Pitt, culminating in a
Ph.D. in anatomy in 1977.

I Braun has taught in the school of
dental medicine since 1975; In 1990
he was named associate professor
and chairman in the department of

U Dental dean named  

oral and maxillofacial surgery, and in

A 1993 he became a professor.

Braun has also served and
presided over several state and
national dental boards.

In a Sept. 4 ,l999, Post-Gazette’
article, Braun’s predecessor Suzuki
was accused of sharply dividing the
dental school faculty with miniscule
pay raises, strict rules for non-
tenured faculty and a habit of play-
ing favorites.

In the press release announcing
Braun’s appointment, Levine cham-
pioned the new dean as having the
endorsement of the local community,
“including faculty, alumni and the
dental society.” Braun’s candidacy
also brought support from colleagues
at Harvard, University of
Pennsylvania and Columbia.

Braun evaluated his goals for the
immediate future of the dental school
in the release. He said that he hopes
to re-examine curriculum, school
admission standards and continuing
education of faculty “to determine
how the school may be able to be re-
engineered such that it is recognized

as a center of -excellence.” _
' Braun also noted the dental
school is establishing a tissue—engi- ‘

Staff Writer

When the Caribbean island of
Grenada was invaded and bombed by
the United States in 1983, Merle
Collins was there. Though’ Collins
survived, several of her friends were
maimed. ,

A native of the Caribbean, Collins
has chosen toexplore the politics and
personal hardship of such events

A through her -poetry. A powerful and

political writer, Collins will be read-
ing for Pitt. students as .part of the

I Contemporary Writers Series today at

8:15 p.m. in the Frick Fine Arts audi-
torium. - .

The ‘Contemporary Writers Series,
now in "its third year, features ' free
readings on- campus by nationally
known authors. According to Jeff

V Oaks, managing director of the series,

the readings are also usually followed
by book signings and question-and-r
answer periods with the authors.

This year, the English department
is working with the Africana studies
department to host several special
writers series‘ events. These readings,
including the Collins performance,

will focus on themes of black litera-
ture and culture. . ‘
“Merle Collins also read herein
1992. Students, and faculty kept ask-
ing ‘when are you going to bring her

, back?”’ said Brenda Barrien of the

Africana studies ‘department.
The authors _are selected by a

committee from the English depart- - -
ment in a process that Lynn Emanuel,‘
series,‘

director of the writers
describes as “fairly democratic.”
Nominations for writers arepmade by

the faculty , but some.nominations are . '
‘‘also'based on what students have _

said” about a great writer they have

“read lately, , said Emanuel. The final

schedule is then determined based on
writers’ availabilities and potential
student interest. — 1

Barrien feels that Collins’ reading
will particularly -appeal to Pitt stu-
dents because she mixes music and
poetrygin her ‘show.

“She performs with a steel drum-

band playing calypso and reggae
music in the -background,” Barrien
said. i ' _ .

Combined with Collins’ thick.
Caribbean accent, she said the effect

an author’s perspective, she said that

writers usually participate in readings
here because “it’s always gratifying to
have an audience.”

Pitt’s audience, in particular,
tends to be especially “well-informed
and responsive”~s at these readings
because of its “enormous undergradu-
ate writing program,” Emanuel said.

Students taking writing or litera-
ture classes at Pitt, take note: some

classes have included these readings
from the Contemporary.Writers Series
as part of the coursework or as extra

credit opportunities. Oaks also teach- '

es a poetry writing class at Pitt.

Oaks said his ‘students will read
“The Daily Mirror,” by David
Lehman, who will speak Nov. 2.

He said many people let poetry
intimidate them, “but meeting a writer
dissolves the idea of the writer as an
infallible, perfect being.” Then, Oaks
said, students can understand that
writing can be “something just about

any of us can be capable of.”

Starbucks in Hillman is

As many a college student
knows, caffeine and studying go
well together. Recognizing this, and

‘perhaps drawing inspiration from

the scores _of kids who can be spot-
ted getting an academic groove on at

such establishments as Starbucks.

Library System has decided to intro-
duce a little caffeine kick to Hillman

Scheduled for completion by

December, the construction of a

recreational reading room in the area
adjacent to the Media Services sec-
tion of Hillman, complete with a
Starbucks Coffee cart, is in the
works. i .

Certainly this will be a great
convenience for those -poor 3 souls

up. Previously, students in this situa-
tion were forced to break their con-

Forbes vicinity.
But is such ahigh degree of

It seems as if Hillman is trying

coffee culture train in an attempt to
attract more students to study there.
While the proposed Starbucks is not
a bad idea, Hillman is perfectly fine
the wayrit is, by virtue of the fact
that it has books — lots of them, and
they are organized in an easy-to-use
system under PittCat. .

t For those students who wish to
study in a coffee shop environment,‘
there are plenty of establishments in
the library vicinity where one can do
just that. Students who chose to
study at the library do so because it
is quiet and in a central location. The

not have to worry about adding

 so do I look Puerto Rican?

It’s hip to be Lat:ino — or so believes
Republican presidential hopeful George 
Bush. The Texas governor has been aggressive-
ly courting Latino voters, and the designated
hitter in this high—stakes political ball game is
his own Latino nephew, George P.

The son of ‘Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush and his Mexican-bom wife
Columba, the telegenic 24-year-old
has created a media sensation since
he began stumping for his uncle. The ABC

News Web site described the Rice University

graduate .as the Bush campaign’s “secret
weapon” (July ll). USA Today contributor

Deborah Sharp gushed, “Let’s face it, he’s a

major hottie” (June 18). Even pop—culture digest
Entertainment Weekly has commented on
young Bush’—s coronation as “the Ricky Martin

. of the Republican party” (Sept. 1).

It’s been strangely unsettling to me to
watch the ascendance of this new political star.
Like George P., I’m a Latino man who is the
product of a bicultural union (in ‘my case,
between a Puerto Rican mother ‘and an Italian-
American father). Similarly, my “Anglo” first
name may obscure my Latino identity to some.

I George P.’s name is just one of the cultural
markers that indicates the complexity of Latino
identity in the contemporary United States. Just
how “Latino” do you have to be to be consid-
ered “Latino” by" the general. public? Sure,
George P. Bush has the whitest of white—bread
names, but he’s ﬂuent in Spanish and appears to

A sport a perpetual tan. ’

And I have to admit, this new Latino icon
sometimes makes me feel a bit too assimilated
in comparison. I can barely hold my own in

- fractured Spanish (I learned late in life as a grad-

uate student here at Pitt), and my pale complex-

ion looks more Goth than Latino.‘ "
Actually, I’m a second generation

“Assiinilatino” with an identity complex. My

8 mother Irma was born in New York City to par-

ents originally from Puerto Rico." She grew up a
fair-skinned Latina who, in contrast to the rest

of her family, spoke English without the hint of I

an accent. To further complicate matters, she

was the only one of four children who did not
many another Puerto Rican. To this day, she
gets angry when she hears a non—Latino say the
phrase that has plagued her for most of her life:
“But you don’t look Puerto Rican!”

But just what is a Puerto
Rican supposed to look like? Or
sound like? I first started to seri-
ously grapple with such issues of
-self—defnition when I was an
_ undergrauate student at the State
University of New York at Buffalo. That school
had a Puerto Rican Studies program, and I
eagerly signed up. for an introductory course.

The instructor had recently arrived from
Puerto Rico, and on the first day of class asked
how many of us spoke Spanish. When all but
three hands shot up, she announced that the
course would be taught in Spanish.

Not having yet learned Spanish, I was
crestfallen. Fortrmately, the instructor allowed
me to remain registered in the class. I designed
my own independent study sequence, and
instead of attending class, I met with her pri-
vately to discuss my work. At the end of the
semester she invited me to give an oral presen-
tation on my semester’s research to the rest of
the class. Finally, I felt like a real Latino despite
my initial exile from the class on linguistic
grounds.

Yes, being Latino is not always a -simple
thing. The way you look, the language you
speak (or don’t speak), your religious inclina-
tion and even your name all inﬂuence the way
both Latinos and people of other ethnic groups

may perceive you. And of course, the situation

is further complicated when one claims multiple
or overlapping cultural identities.

But all in all, I enjoy being Latino, and "I
ﬁnd it fulﬁlling to share this culture with ‘others
regardless of their ethnic identity. I don’t
begrudge George P.’s day as the Latino media
idol du jour, but I hope that George W. and his
media handlers don’t trivialize a rich and
diverse culture in their quest for votes.

Technology and education do not go hand in mouse

Over the past three weeks, I’ve often
found myself answering questions with the
phrase,_’i“JCo11rseweb is evil.” I’ve been
answering that question a lot recently

puters. When I got myiinewest computer, I

Courseweb’s problems man-
ifest themselves in a variety of ways:
Students are unable to access Courseweb
from home, students waste time waiting for

printouts (or get blank pages, the menu bar‘

and other common outputs) or their comput-
ers freeze. In addition, faculty members
report difficulty placing material onto
Courseweb (one professor who. attempted to
use it quickly realized the futility of the task
and gave up). Why, if the system is so
ﬂawed, is it used? The answer is simple —
an overabundant faith in technology.

We hear that machines will make our
lives easier, more convenient and more plea-
surable. Don’t buy it. The more possessions
we have (especially ones that consume
many hours of the day), the more complicat-
ed our lives become. Even when upgrading
machines, stress always increases. My old

. The 14th-ranked Pitt men’s soc-
cer team will head into its big game
with No. 4 Connecticut on Friday
with a perfect 6-0 record after last
night’s 1-0 win over Canisius.

The Panthers victory didn’t come
easy, however.

Pitt didn’t play at its best and
even seemed ﬂat—footed throughout
most of the game.

The Panthers controlled the ball
for the most part‘ but blew a number
of great scoring opportunities.

“We didn’t play as well as we
have to,” said head coach Joe
Luxbacher. “We had lots of chances,

‘A ‘ I’m just glad we won.”

The first five minutes of the

 g game weredominated by the Golden

Griffins.

They had two-shots on goal and
kept the ball in Pitt territory, but
those five minutes were all the
opportunities that Canisius had in the
game.

At about the seven-minute mark
of the first half, the Panthers turned it
on. — ~

Personal best times and strong

freshmen finishes highlighted the,

Panther cross country team’s trip to the
Penn ‘State Spiked Shoe Invitational in

University Park, Pa., this past week-

end. . . . -
“It was deﬁnitely a step in the right
direction,” said head coach Waddie

Freeman, remarking on how both the '

men and‘ women’s teams ﬁnished far
ahead of where they were last year at
the meet. V _

At last year’s Spiked Shoe
Invitational, the teams ﬁnished near the
bottom of the 25—team ﬁelds.

On Saturday, the men finished 12th
out of 23, receiving 375 points, while
the women ﬁnished 13th out of 25 with
412 points. 5

William & Mary won the men’s
competition, beating out James
Madison and Penn State, while
Michigan won the women’s competi-
tion, followed by West Virginia and

James Madison. ‘ ' ‘

Freshman Mike Diano, who has
been one of the Panthers’ strongest run-
ners since the season started, was the
top finisher for the men. He came in at
46th with a time of 26 minutes, 52.90

' seconds on the 5.2—rnile course.

, “Mike, was the second freshman
overall. to cross the finish line,”
Freeman -said and continued praising

Diano for. his accomplishments while

running with some of the best competi-
tion in the nation. ' F

Just behind Diano was senior cap-
tain Mike Head, who came in 52nd
with a time of 27:00.51.

Head had the best performance for
the team when they ran at the Hillbilly

I

Invitational at West Virginia two weeks
ago. A
While Freeman was impressed by
these two runners’ performances, he
was a little concerned about how the
rest of the men finished.

“There was a big gap between our
second runner and our third runner,”
Freeman said.

For the women, Amanda Schmidt
continued to lead the way for the
Panthers, taking 55th place overall with
a time of 23:00.87 on the 6,000-meter
course.

7 It was the third consecutive meet
that the junior placed ﬁrst among the
Pitt women, and her time was a person-
al best fora 6,000-meter course.

man who made some waves this week-
end, as she ﬁnished second on the team

KAREN BIELAK

Staff Writer

For anyone who has not yet followed
the Pitt men’s soccer team this "season, now
would probably beﬁa good time to start.
The team is ‘currently undefeated and
ranked N o. 14 in the country heading into
last night’s game against Canisius.

A large part of that succ_ess can be
attributed to the stellar play of Chad Porter.

And to think that just a few years ago
the business marketing major almost left
the game of soccer altogether. ' _

I The senior midﬁelder from Irwin, Pa.,
has been around the game his entire life.
He grew up with three older brothers who
all played soccer, and consequently, he
began playing in games of his own at- the
age of five. I .

Porter was a standout during the years
he played for Penn—Trafford High School,
earning four letters and setting school
records for goals in a season (34) and in a
career (73). Three times he earned All-
Conference and All-Section honors and
was twice named to the All—State team. In
addition, Porter was an All-Region and
two-time All—Western Pennsylvania
Interscholastic Athletic League selection

and the member of a two-time sectionf

championship team. .
As a senior, Porter was named both the
Section I Player of the Year and the East

Player of the Year. He also played for the
Olympic -Development Program regional
team and the Beadling cup-team. He was
the captain of Beadling when it won the

Western Pennsylvania cup, championship 

in .1996.

While Porter enjoyed tremendous suc-
cess with high school soccer, he excelled in
other sports as well, earning two letters in.
football and one in track. But the decision
to continue playing soccer- was an easy

one; considering his superiority in the g

sport.

Porter spent the 1997 season‘ playing‘
soccer at James Madison, scoring two
goals in 18 matches. But hisioverall -expe-
rience with the program was not ‘a favor-
able one, and Porter considered quitting
the sport. ' I

“I was the first sub on and I was get-.
ting a lot of playing time, but it was almost
too demanding,” Portersaid. ' —

Porter then discussed the situation with
his brother Jeff, who played soccer at Pitt
from 1992-96_. The advice he gave his
younger brother was that perhaps he was
just playing at the wrong place. He went on
to describe his experience playing here at
Pitt and how he really enjoyed it. Porter

liked what he heard and then decided to 
contact the coaches. Upon doing so he was 

made an offer and transferred for the fol-
lowing season.

PORTER

In his first season as a Panther,
Porter saw action in 14 games, all of
which he started.iA shoulder injury
forced him to miss four games, but
nonetheless he finished’ the season

' tied for second on the team in scor-

ing. Porter recorded four goals and
four assists on 27 shots, including the
game-winning goal against Canisius.

ing, registering 10 points. He had
four goals and two assists‘ in 15 con-
tests, 13 of which he started. Porter
recorded 33 shots on goal. and had
two four—point’ games on the season.
Thelfirst was in the Panthers’ opening
game against St. Francis, with Porter
scoring a goal and two assists in the
3-0 victory. He then scored two goals
in the match against Cleveland State,
including the game-winner. ’ I

So far this season, Porter has
taken ll shots, scoring only once. But
that one goal proved to be a huge one
for the Panthers, as it was the game-
winner in a 1-0 upset against host St.
John’s, a team that was at the time
No. 2 in the nation. I -

“I was just at the right place at the
right time, that’s. how players get

beginning of the game so you would-,
n’t expect that to be the game—winner,

I 'but it was, and it was really exciting.”
Soccer is not the only sport Porter,

has a passion for, as ‘he is a big foot-
ball fan and enjoys Watching both
college football and the NFL. When
Porter is not busy with soccer and
classes, he simply likes to relax.

“I spend way too much time run-

laugh. . I I
While Porter-has played a large
role in the success of the Pitt soccer

team so far this season, he feels there , t

are a number of factors which have
molded the team into one of the top
competitors in the country. He notices
that the greatest change from last sea-
son is the team’s work ethic, both in
the preseason and at practice.

“Our, practices are a lot more
intense, and we’re definitely focused
on making ourselves the best team we
can be,” Porter said. _ _

While Porter also cites a “good

the team’sKtakeoff, he was quick to
praise his fellow’ teammates -as well.
“We have a freshman defender,

Clay [Haﬂich], who has stepped up “

and is playing a prettywkey role,”

Porter said. “We also have two com— '-

petitive goalies and we’ve deﬁnitely»
seen, improvements in both.” 4 ' A’
, Because this is his last year with
the team, Porter himself came into the
year in the best shape possible.
He has assumed a leadership role

possibly be, to help it reach its ulti-
mate goal. _ I '

reaching the NCAA tournament."
However, Porter and the rest of
the team know that in order to

achieve that goal, they must first '

make the Big East tournament and
perform well there.

“Each game we win " brings us
closer to that goal,” Porter said.
“We_’re off to a really good start.”

Freeman was very happy with how
much the women have improved from
last season. ’

“Last year, the team was next to

last in the Big East,” Freeman s-aid. ,

“They had a big improvement.”
On Sept. 30, the team returns to the

hills of Schenley. Park for the

Duquesne Invitational, and with full

participation from both the women and
men, Freeman expects big results. ’

“The teams are ready» to compete‘

for the title,” said Freeman, as the

Panthers will face some top teams at .

the meet.

With the substantial success this I

year’s team has already had over last

. year’s, Freeman can only see things

getting better. , V t I

“When the «team improves just
about every meet, there is ‘nothing
more that you can ask for.”

called “The Black Honus Wagner.”

“After I saw him play, I felt hon-
ored that they should name such a
great ballplayer after me,” Wagner
said. -

Yet on the official all—century
team ballot, Lloyd’s name wasn’t even
included. No one who has studied his
career in any detail would place him
below the likes of Cal Ripken and
Ozzie Smith, who were on the ballot
instead.

While leaving Ed Delahanty off
all—century teams makes sense (he
died in 1903, after hitting .333 at age
35, following years of .376 and .354),

FROM PAGE 9

. his exclusion from consideration of

all—time teams is astounding.

Delahanty has the seventh highest
batting average ever and led his
league in slugging five times. He was
among the top five in homers six
times and the top 10 in total bases 11
times. Despite playing in the “Dead
Ball Era,” he managed to top a .500
career slugging percentage.

Because he played primarily in the

‘ 19th century, almost no one raises his

name in discussing who follows Ted
Williams among all—time left ﬁelders.

Smokey Joe Williams is often
ranked as one of the top five pitchers
in baseball history, yet wasn’t even
inducted into the Hall of Fame until a
year ago. Some place him second only
to_ Walter Johnson, but Williams got

THE Prrr NEws

slightedpbecause of his skin color and
continues to get slighted.

Lacking the showman personality
and wit of Satchel Paige, he is rated as
the better hurler by any Negro League
scholar and was similarly given a
higher rating when the Pittsburgh

Courier once listed the all—time Negro A

League team.

When you say “Smokey .Joe,.”
though, the baseball fan thinks of
Smokey Joe Wood instead. Even when
Williams finally got into
Cooperstown, the media all but
ignored the belated honor.

There are other early-era whites
and Negro League blacks who get
slighted in “top 10” or “top 20” lists
by position, too numerous to cover
each in depth (which increases the
shamefulness of the matter.)

Men like Buck Ewing, Willie
Wells, King Kelly, Buck Leonard,
Roger Connor, Turkey Steames, Billy
Hamilton and Sam Thompson are’ cast

‘away in any discussion. .

Until men like Charleston are
included in discussions of the best
players ever, or men like Delahanty
and Wells are included in discussions
of the best at their position, baseball
fans will be overlooking some great
talents, offering false conclusions as a

, result.

SOCCER

Midfielder Chad Porter gave a

great pass behind the defense to for--

ward Spencer Barton who couldn’t
quite beat Canisius goalkeeper Dave
Borchard to the ball, thus starting a
series of missed opportunities for the
Panthers’; A V

At the 11-minute mark, the
Panthers had two consecutive corner
kicks, but the first was knocked aside
by Borchard and on the second, Chris
Churchill’s’header was wide.

For the next 20 minutes, play
continued back and forth with few
scoring chances for either team.

In thei30th minute of the first
half, the Panthers took over the
tempo of the game once again and
began to drive the ball into the
Canisius zone. Porter dribbled the

ball toward the side of the net and

took a blistering shot that was saved
by Borchard.

Two minutes later, the Panthers
caught Canisius’ defense sleeping
and forward Josh iWhitham found
himself all alone on a breakaway.

As he dribbled in toward the net,
he took a shot at the bottom left cor-
ner of the goal, but Borchard barely
got his left foot on the ball and forced
it wide.

On the ensuing corner kick, the
ball was deﬂected out to midfield-and
another opportunity slipped away
from the Panthers.

WEDNESDAY: SEFIEMBER 20, 2000

The second half started the same
way the first had ended, with Pitt
controlling the tempo of the game,
but missing its scoring opportunities.

Through the first six minutes of
the second half, Pitt had a direct kick
deflected wide, a shot by. Bryan

Hopper stopped by the keeper and a -

battle in front of the Canisius net in
which two Pitt players got great shots
off denied by a sprawling Borchard.

. The lone goal of the game was

scored 20 minutes ‘into the second
half by freshman defenseman Clay
Haﬂich. _ .
He receiveda centering pass and
kicked it out ofmid-air and into a
wide open net. ,
The goal was Haﬂich’s first on

the collegiate “level” and his first "

points as well.

“It’s a big relief,” said Haﬂich on
scoring his first goal. “Anyone can
put it in the net, even if you’re a
defenseman.”

Pitt was able to slow down the
pace and run out the clock.

I The win marked the 12th straight
time that Pitt has beaten Canisius.

Next up for the Panthers is the
showdown with Connecticut at
Quaker Valley High School. _

Luxbacher praised the Huskies

‘on their defense and theirteam.

“UConn is the best team in the
country. That No. 4 ranking ‘means
nothing to me. They are the best
team. They play great defensively,”
Luxbacher said. .
