second in a series investigating
various aspects of the University
of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

The University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine is under scru-
tiny regarding allegationsrof a
conflict of interest in receiving
governmental and private funds
for drug research.

Since September, a‘congres—
sional subcommittee has been in-
vestigating the alleged conflict.

er violated governmental regula-
tions set by the National Institute
of Health.

According to a congressional
source, the House subcommittee
has discovered that Dr. Charles
Bluestone, as director of Otitis
Media Research Center at Chil-

‘ dren’s Hospital, failed to disclose

receiving more than $1 million in
grants from private industry to
study drugs he was researching
under NIH funding. The center is
designed to research middle—ear"
infections.

Funded by an NIH grant, Blue-
stone and his colleagues were
studying the effectiveness of
amoxicillin, a drug commonly
prescribed for middle-ear dis-
eases in children.

”Throughout the period of time
that the center has been perform-
ing NIH-funded research on the
effectiveness of antibiotics in the
treatment of middle-ear disease
[including amoxicillin], the
Center and a primaryinvestigator
have had ongoing, substantial
economic relationships with the

manufacturers of the antibiotics
under study,” Dr. Erdem I. Can-
tekin, a Pitt professor of otolaryn-
gology (ear, nose and throat), said
at the congressional hearing.
Cantekin argued that the center

"should not conduct industry-

sponsored research on drug effec-
tiveness. He added that the center
should perform studies only
when funded by neutral sources.

SG B non-G reeks discuss difficulties

They didn't ”go C-reek,” but
they were elected to the Student
Government Board nonetheless.
Ask either of them and you'll dis-
cover that it wasn't easy getting
there.

Of the nine SGB members,
only two, Julie Shepard and Justin
Lawhead, aren't members of a
fraternity or sorority, despite the
fact that 88 percent of Pitt stu-
dents are non-Greeks.

This is not a recent phenome-

  

non, according to Student Activi-
ties spokesman and former SGB
president, Luke Kluchko. A
majority of the board has been

Greek for as many years as he can

recall, he said.

”Call me biased, but I'd like to
see more non-Greeks up here,”
Lawhead said. ”It’s great if you
are Greek, but it should not be a
prerequisite.”

Lawhead said that when he

came to Pitt, he thought joining
a fraternity seemed to be the
”thing to do" if you wanted to

make many friend$<iHe,noW‘-fee'5r-

     

that he was wrong.

”Greek life never really ap-
pealed to me,” he said. He finds
a great source of friendship in his
roommates who, he said, ”are
now my best friends.”

_. Lawhead said he found run-
ning for SGB difficult because he
had to do most of his campaign-
ing by himself, although he got
some help from his roommates.

”Sometimes I think it's unfair.

Shevardnadze will ask Israel to negotiate with PLOG

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) ~ Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard-
nadze, on the eve of separate
talks with Israeli and PLO offi-
cials, said Tuesday he would try
to persuade Israel to negotiate
with PLO chief Yasser Arafat.

Shevardnadze’s 10-day Middle
East initiative faces its toughest
test Wednesday when he meets
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens in an effort to sell Israel on
his peace plan. Arens warned that
arranging peace talks could be a
lengthy process.

”Peacemaking in the Middle
East is a very difficult exercise. It
is a painfully slow process. But
we are both convinced that very
intensive efforts have to be made
to try to put momentum in the
process and try to move the
process forward,” Arens said.

Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel—Meguid, speaking to
reporters after meeting Arehs-,
also indicated that preparatory
moves might take a long time.

”We will keep on discussing
and talking and having a dia-
logue, a means we believe in

IIUUUHUI IUUUUIIUUIIIUUT JUUUUUUUUUQ

even if the dialogue takes a long
time,” he said.

Israel is adamantly opposed to
talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which it views as
a terrorist group. It also has seri-
ous reservations about the Soviet
concept of an international con-
ference, which would include the
PLO.

”We are trying to persuade Is-
rael” to enter negotiations with
the PLO, Shevardnadze told
reporters after meeting with Egyp-
tian Prime Minister Ahmed Sidqi.

Israeli Prime,Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, leaving on a four-day trip
to France, was chilly toward the
Soviet proposal of a V U.N.—
sponsored Middle East peace
conference.

Britain expels envoy
over Rushdie order

Iran recalled all its ambassadors
from European Common Market
nations Tuesday and Britain ex-
pelled an Iranian envoy as the

diplomatic battle grew over
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s
death threats against author
Salman Rushdie.

In Washington, President Bush
said he supported the retaliatory
moves by the European
countries.

NEWS BRIEFS

However offensive Rushdie’s
book, The Satanic Verses, may be
to Moslems, ”inciting murder
and offering rewards for its per-
petration "are deeply offensive to
the norms of civilized behavior,”
Bush said.

The United States does not
have diplomatic relations with
Iran. Bush noted existing eco-
nomic sanctions against Iran and
said: ’’I don't know where we'll
go from there.”

Iran's official Islamic Republic

matic recall was in response to.

”The people of the United
States want to know that the
drugs marketed are effective,”
Minsky said. ”One of the ways to
test this effectiveness is for the
NIH to fund university research
facilities to review objectively
and give analysis about that drug.

”When a university laboratory
or a university scientist gets a

effectiveness of the drug, the NIH

because the center had the NIH-
funded research underway,”
Cantekin told the congressional
subcommittee.

Bluestone’s analysis of research
claimed that amoxicillin is effec-
tive. Cantekin, a co-investigator
in the group, dissented this
analysis.

’’In my opinion, they have
broken the protocol of their anal-
ysis. They did not fulfill what was
required from them [by the
NIH],’’ Cantekin said. ”Only with
that miniscule vision if you look
at the data, you show thatthe
drug is effective. If you look at it
in any other way., the drug is not
effective.”

Bluestone could

not be

reached for comment, but in a
December interview with The
University Times, he explained
that the 60-member Otitis Media
Research Center concluded that
amoxicillin is statistcally effective
for more patients than is a place-
bo; however, the antibiotic does
not work in all cases.

A university panel also report-
ed that because of the use of
”different data subsets and differ-
ent analysis methods, results and
thus interpretations could be
quite variable.”

Dr. Eugene Myers, the head of
the department of otolaryngolo-
gy, confirmed that the medical
school is still receiving money for
biomedical research from drug

companies. However, Myers dis-
agreed that receiving money from
pharmaceutical companies cre-
ates a biased outcome of a
government-funded study.

’’If you say, ’We’re still getting
money from drug companies,’ it
sounds as if we are on the
’take,’ ” Myers said. ”The effica-
cy of drugs must be proven be-
fore they are FDA-approved for
marketing. Since the pharmaceu-
tical companies don't have ac-
cess to patients, they want to get
people who are most reliable.

”Part of the research we are do-
ing concerns the efficacy of the
drugs, and part of the biomedical
research is funded by drug com-
panies,” he added.

Strong steps needed
to eliminate racism

Penn State University has had five racial incidents within the
last month, and on campus, there is a high level of concern about
the problem of racial harmony. Protesters have made appearances
at rallies and basketball games to speak out against the problems,
and they have met with strong support for their position from ad-
ministration officials. Provost William Richardson came to one pro-
test after midnight to meet with students and agreed to call back
a team of social scientists who examined the environment for
blacks in December. They will re—evaluate the situation, due to
charges that the previous study was inaccurate due to its timing
— the study coincided with the finals period at the university.

There have also been suggestions that PSU consider forming a
judicial board to handle disciplinary action for students involved
in racial incidents.

While all of these options are good avenues to pursue, it seems
as if there could be better solutions to the problems. Penn State's
actions seem more productive than any corresponding steps taken
at other universities, but they still fall short of dealing with the
source of the problem — the attitudes of the students. This is some-
thing rather difficult to address, but there are possibilities. - ’

While the administration, notably university President Bryce Jor-
dan, has made statements supporting the student—organized pro-
tests and also agreed to meet with concerned black students daily,
as yet, there has been no effort to organize a more catholic meet-
ing of students. The university should be working with both white

and black students in an effort to discern areas of misunderstand- -

ing and fear, and attempt to alleviate these and other tensions. By
organizing larger, university-sponsored functions designed to at-
tract,both white and black students, the problem can be dealt with
twice as effectively.

The concerns of black students about discrimination and bigo-
try are legitimate, and the students have shown _courage and
responsibility in their expression of these worries. Now, what is
needed is for the university to take strong steps, involving the whole
community, to correct the problems. Only by bringing all aspects
of the community together can there be a solution. And if Penn
State can resolve its conflicts, then it can point the way for other
communities, including Pittsburgh, to follow. .

Trade and education

More than 40 percent of Americans feel Japanese economic su-
periority is more threatening to U.S. interests than Soviet military
strength, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

The survey showed a tendency for Americans to want the govern-
ment to do more to lessen the perceived gap in trade between
the United States and Japan.

But high import tariffs increase retail prices, which push infla-
tion up as well, and this is not a solution to our problems.

Our economy is afflicted with a tendency known as inertia. Un-
less acted upon by some external force, it will continue to stag-
nate, eventually spiraling down beyond the point of no return.

America is a land blessed with abundant material resources, but
that is not enough. We now need to make use of one of our greatest
natural resources: our youth. International studies and education
at universities throughout the nation must be recognized as a vi-
tal part of the rejuvenation process already beginning in the Ameri-
can business community.

Universities should ”have a crucial role to play in the training,
education and development of players in the international trade
process,” according to Dr. Duane Hall, executive director of the
Center for International Trade Development. ”[They are] going to
need courses in international studies and languages. [They are] go-
ing to need courses in the politics and the economics of overseas
environments.”

This is a more realistic approach to solving the problems caused
by our trade with Japan, even though the majority of Americans
polled said they would accept the higher prices entailed by eco-
nomic protectionism. Americans are not known for their ability
to be self-sacrificing. Does anyone remember the energy crisis of
the ear|y"70s when we pulled together?

The rise and fallof Christianity

To say that these are tough
times for Christians is to say that
Christ suffered only a bit at the
hands of the Romans.

Around the globe, many Chris-
tian denominations are ”celebrat-
ing” Lent, the 40-day precursor to
Easter which calls for various
forms of fasting and penance.
Perhaps it will be during this time
that Christians will ponder just
what is happening to the Christi-
an religion. I

About a week ago, Barbara
Harris was consecrated as the first
woman bishop of the Episcopal
Church. This has caused a furor
between traditionalists and
feminists within the church.
Feminists argue that women
should also be allowed to follow 4
the example of Christ's apostles.
They point out that two women,
Mary Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Christ, were at the
Crucifixion while the apostles ran»
away in fear (this argument bla-
tantly omits the crucial presence
ofJohn the Apostle at Calvary as
well). Traditionalists counter by
saying that if Christ wanted wom-
en as religious leaders, then some
of the apostles would have been
female. Indeed, the radical
feminists have become so in-
flamed with the idea of a patriar-
chal religion that many feminist
”post-Christian" religious groups
have adopted the figure of a
”Christa,” an artwork designed
by Edwina Sandys, which por-
trays a nude, crucified female in
substitution for the traditional
crucifix.

This whole idea mocks all
Christianity by supposing or even
wishing that Christ was a wom-
an. If Christ/God was a woman,
then why did Christ pray to His
Father in the Garden of
Gethsemane? .

The consecration of Harris
could also lead to a schism
among Episcopalians. My friend
of the week, Mike Van Auker,
who considers himself a tradition-

erza ettihm-3:

al Episcopalianffeels that the fact
that Harris is divorced and has
only been a priest for eight years
also makes the consecration sus-
picious. According to Van Auk-
er, the idea of a divorced male
priest being consecrated so soon
would be considered ”highly
unusuaL”

Ideology has also been a major

‘ spear in the side for Christians.

Just how much Christian dogma
can you reject and still call your-
self a Christian? There are many
”cafeteria Catholics” who pick

, and choose portions of Catholic

beliefs which accommodate
them, yet reject others as if they
were pieces of rotten fruit.

Can a Roman Catholic who
does not believe in transubstan-
tiation, the infallibility of ‘the
pope on church matters and the
”communion of saints" really be
considered a Roman Catholic?
What is the purpose of going to
Mass if you consider 50 percent
of it to be superstitious absurdi-
ty? In fact, how many Christians
really believe in all of the Profes-
sion of Faith/Nicene Creed?

Ideology in the church is just
the start of the problem. Many
homosexuals consider them-
selves Christians, yet twice the Bi-
ble condemns this behavior.
Leviticus 18:22 states, ’’If a man
lies with a man as with a wom-
an, both of them have committed

an abomination; they shall be put
to death. ...” The New Testament

‘casts equal aspersions on
homosexuality in Romans 1:26.
Paul the Apostle tells us, ”Men
burned with lust for each other 
and as a result paid within their
own souls with the penalty they
so richly deserved.”

Indeed, the above passages
leave gays in a quandary. What
they do is explicitly condemned
by their religion, yet many are
more ”Christian” than regular
churchgoers. If gays are sincere

about their Christianity,‘ perhaps -

they should reconsider the be-
havior which the church so ac-.
tively condemns.

Many of the faults lie in the
Christians themselves. They seem
to be constantly shooting them-
selves in the foot, then putting it
forward, as if it were the better of
the two. Alleged molestation of
youths by priests, the long-

standing and flat-out stupid tradi- .- .

tion of blaming the Jews for
Christ's death, even fighting
among themselves — witness
West Beirut and Ulster. —— has
damaged the church's reputation.
If the church isn't mucking things
_up, it is wearing its alleged mar-
tyrdom like a crown of thorns for
all to see —.— contradicting Christ's
”Sermon on the Mount" as an ex-
ample of proper behavior. 2
Far be it from me to stand back
like some guiltless, omnipotent
observer, blaming here, absolv-
ing there. Though I call myself a
Catholic, I am guilty of the most
heinous of all crimes — hypocri-
sy. The fact that I recognize this
sin, yet fail to act, is even worse.
Perhaps thisis the Lent during
which Christians will sit back, re-
examine their beliefs and use
» Easter, the ultimate symbol of
redemption, as their start of a new
moral year.

°One dollar gets an adventure in mudslinging

After weeks of procrastinating,
I finally attempted to complete
my I04OEZ income tax return
form. At a brief glance the form
seemed simple and ”easy" to fill
out. However, I was amazed to
discover that the Internal
Revenue Service actually has a
sense of humor.
For among the bits of informa-
Qion that the IRS wants to know
is whether the taxpayer is willing
to contribute one dollar to the
Presidential Election Campaign
Fund, and it further notes that
”checking ‘yes’ will not change
your tax or reduce your refund.”

AMY KING
LIEBMAN “

What a joke! Only a few short
months after witnessing the worst
presidential campaign ever, I
can't help but think the lRS’s re-
quest is hilarious. In fact, I not
only refuse to check "yes,” but
I want my dollar back!

At one time, I truly looked for-

ward to the 1988 presidential
election. After all, it was the first
major election that I was permit-
ted to vote in.

However, I was quickly disillu-
sioned with both candidates be-
fore the conventions even began,
and as the campaign neared an
end, I was thoroughly disgusted.

Because he was not appealing
enough to win on his own,
Bush's strategy consisted of
savaging Dukakis in a cutthroat
campaign. Dukakis, on the other
hand, with weak responses to his
opponent's jabs, only aided Bush
in his victory.

Within this ”Mondalizing of
Mike Dukakis,” real issues like
education, the deficit, and health-
care were superficially addressed
while questions of values and
symbols dominated the
campaign.

Bush attempted to charm voters
with the story of Willie Horton,
the murderer who escaped a
Massachusetts prison while on
furlough in 1986, and the empty
electric chair that accompanied
this tragedy.

Also, the vice president did not
fail to make major issues out of
the polluted Boston harbor and
the Pledge of Allegiance.

Unable to articulately respond
to Bush's childish games,
Dukakis allowed his opponent_ to

accomplish his main objective —‘

making the Massachusetts gover-
nor look like a complete wimp,
weak on issues like crime, pollu-
tion, taxes and defense.

Dukakis did try to gain some
strength with his "GI Mike” com-
mercials, and only a week prior
to the election was Dukakis final-
ly able to admit that yes —- "I'm
a liberal,”

Unfortunately for the Duke,
these reprisals came too late to
save his damaged image.

But, why should a candidate be
forced to respond to the trivial
and nasty cuts made by his oppo-
nent in order to win?

More important, why should
millions of dollars, with a good
portion of it coming from the tax-
payers, be spent to aid politicians

7t's not just a case of ‘the blues’

One evening while I was talk-
ing with a co-worker, the subject
of depression came up. ’

”You know," she said to me
cheerfully, "I feel so much better
than I did last month." I nodded,
thinking to myself that she had

emed rather down, and she
continued, ''I was starting to think
that it would never go away — it
never lasted that long before.”

I began to feel concerned:
Depression is one of my favorite
subjects; since I've had so much
personal experience with it, I've
become somewhat of a crusader
on an ever—present mission to dis-
cover and expose it wherever it
5, in an attempt to educate ”the
public.”

So, I tried to keep the intensity
from my voice as I asked,
”You’ve experienced these very
dark moods before?” '
» She hesitated a minute, as
though counting the occasions in
her head, and then she nodded.
”I get really depressed sometimes
for no reason,” she said, smiling
doubtfully, "but usually I just
wait it out and it goes away. This
time, though... ” ‘

"Does this happen regularly,‘

say, at specific times every year?
qs anyone else in your~fami|_y like
this?” I hoped I didn't sound too
much like my own psychiatrist.
”Actually, yes. And my moods
are nothing — my mother gets
these periodic moods that we call
her ‘black moods,’ when we just
don't even go near her. And‘ my
brother is... well, he's violent,

and he tried to commit suicide I

once.” W _
.. She laughed, and continued;

     

~ After that, we went to   

therapy and, more and more
often, with antidepressant drugs,
much as a diabetic is treated with
insulin. In most cases, treatment
is effective and can begin to work
in as little as a week, frequently
producing a complete turnaround
in a patient’s mood.

Yet, many people who realize
they are depressed don't ever
seek treatment. Their reasons are
many: Some think they aren't
depressed enough; many are
ashamed and view being
depressed as being weak; treat-
ment is expensive (although most
health insurance covers from 50
percent to 80 percent of out-
patient psychiatric care); and, un-
fortunately, many have sought
professional help and been disap-
pointed by inadequate psycholo-
gists and
discouraging them from trying
again.

HEATHER LUM

Clinical depression, if left un-
treated, doesn't usually just go
away —— it has a» nasty tendency
to return again and again, grow-
ing more severe with each epi-
sode. Over a period of years,
grim hangers-on suffer severe
emotional damage, and those
who cannot stand the suffering
may try, and sometimes succeed
in, taking their own lives.

The answers to the excuses for
not pursuing treatment:

0 There is no specific "level"

to which one must sink to be
qualified as depressed enough to
‘need professional help. The doc-
t_o,r is not going to laugh at any-

psychiatrists, ’

$100 an hour, they are usually
willing to work with patients to
devise a payment plan for por-
tions of bills not covered by in-
surance. Aren't good mental and
physical health worth it? The two
are more closely linked than peo-
ple realize.

0 One of the most discouraging

A aspects of suffering from depres-

sion is searching for "the right

doctor." It is very difficult for a —

depressed person with little or no
energy, low self-esteem and no
motivation to sever ties with a.
doctor who is not helping him
and find a new one. It helps to
have supportive friends or rela-
tives who can aid in this quest,
which may, for a while, seem
endless.

But it is important that a
depressed person feel comforta-
ble with his doctor or therapist,
and that he or she is actually
helping him recover. Any psy-
chologist or therapist should be
experienced in both psychother-
apy and the use of antidepres-
sants, more of/which are being
discovered all the time.‘

Pittsburgh is fortunate in that it
is the home of one of the coun-
try’s
research facilities, Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic. Any-
one may seek treatment from
Western Psych, and those
without health insurance who are
Allegheny County residents can
pay for treatment on a sliding
scale.

I told my co-worker all of these
things, and I told her of my ex-

perience with depression in my H

family and in myself. I empha-

‘sized how much treatment, pri-

foremost depression? .

in their ridiculous games to ac-
complish their quest for the
presidency?

Although it is unrealistic to ex-
pect politicians to fund their cam-
paigns from their own pockets, it
isn't too much to ask that they use
the money with some respect for
the intelligence of the American
public. '

It's difficult to imagine, but I
don't think that a president like
Abe Lincoln could be elected in
the campaigns that this country
has become accustomed to.

As I cast my vote on election
day, I was forced to vote for the
better candidate and not the one
I liked. It came down to the
choice of the lesser of two evils.

To the IRS, thanks but no
thanks, and I want my dollar
refunded.

Those. who advocate gay
rights seem none too happy
with any of- Pittsburgh's

appear to be especially dis-

stance on the issue. Or should
I say, her lack thereof?

In the news, it seems that
wherever Ms. Masloff goes,

Among the city's election
dramas, the gay rights issue
has taken center stage. Politi-
cians are being extraordinari-
ly cautious not to take a stand
so as not to offend any of the
voters. Admittedly, this is not
a novel practice in the ‘politi-
cal realm — in fact, I seem to
recall a presidential election in
which the same approach was
taken not so long ago...

But through this seemingly
_ acceptable political practice,
the Pittsburgh mayoral candi-
dates have managed to offend
many voters, myself included.

Sophie protests protest

Presuming that Pittsburgh
possesses all of the "dignity"
(interesting choice of words,
Sophie) of Paris, Vienna and
Rome, I would still have to
wonder if Sophie isn't missing
the point, just a little.

Now, Sophie, I know it's
kind of a drag that these peo-
ple are standing in the way of
your campaign efforts and that
you're probably wondering
why they would lower them-

selves, you and the city of ~

Pittsburgh, to such a nasty lev-
el, so devoid of dignity.

I think, Ms. Masloff, that
they're doing it with the hope
that you won't be elected.
They seem to be afraid that
you aren't quite the candidate
for them. I think they doubt
that you intend to protect their
rights. ‘

What they're doing, Sophie,
is protesting. And naughty as
it seems, they’.re allowed to do
so. They can plague your ev-
ery campaign function like lo-

" custs, and there really isn't '

much you can do about it.

Ridiculous, isn't it? But that's .
the way the old founding "I

fathers set the whole thing up.

they didn't want fascism to

Knight's number is up as Pittretires No.34

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

After a 15-year hiatus from the
University of Pittsburgh, the jer-
sey of basketball great Billy
Knight was retired at the half of
Monday night's nationally tele-
vised Pitt—Villanova game.

S Knight joins the elite ranks of
All-American guard Don Hennon
(1956-59) and Pitt's all-time lead-
ing scorer Charles Smith in hav-
ing his jersey ‘encased in the
men's varsity locker room in Fitz-
gerald Field House.

Knight was a member of one of
the most successful basketball
teams lll Pitt history. During the
1973-74 season (Knight's senior
year), Pitt won aschool-record 21
games in a row and finished 25-4.
The team advanced to the Eastern
Regional Finals in the NCAA
Tournament where they lost to
eventual \lCAA champion North
Carolina State. J '

Knight led the Panthers in scor-
ing and rebounding for three con-
secutive seasons, averaging 22.2
points per game. He is fifth on the
all—time scoring list with 1,731
points, and fourth in the rebound-
ing category (938).

”lt’s an honor to be considered
in the same [league] as Don Hen-
non and Charles Smith,” Knight
said. 5 '

”lt’s the epitome of what you
can achieve when you're a play--

er; to have your number retired
by the team that you played for,”

(6 he said.

.1

Knight is fourth in all—time field
goal percentage (.522) and 10th
in free-throw percentage (.748).

The most impressive aspect of
Knight's career is that he only
played for three seasons. He sat
out his freshman year to straight-
en out his academic life.

If one would project Knight's

Women gymnasts

figures over four years, he would
surpass Smith by over 300 points.
Smith pl_ayed for a Pitt team
which boasted such talent as Jer-
ome l.ane and Demetreus Gore,
enough talent to win the Big East
title two consecutive seasons.
Knight came to play for a team
which had only one winning sea-
‘ en ears. During the

 

 

 

three years that Knight played,
Pitt climbed into the top 10 and
played one of its final post-season
games in the Final Eight of the
NCAA tournament.

Knight was selected in the first
round of the American Basketball
Association draft by the Indi-
anapolis Pacers and also by the
National Basketball Association's

Los Angeles Lakers.

During his pro career, Knight
was named an All-Pro three times
and scored over 10,000 points af-
ter stints with Indiana, Buffalo,
Boston, Kansas City and San
Antonio.

fall to Penn

State, Kent State in tight meets

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers gave Penn
State University a run for its
money last Friday night in front
of a crowd of 2,500 at PSU’s
Recreation Hall. 1

Pitt lost the meet but scored
their highest team total of the sea-
son with 181.05_points. Penn
State scored 182.3.

’’It was extremely competi-
tive," head coach Debbie Yoh-
man said. ”They were competing
against each other during
warm-ups.”

The two teams alternated rou-
_tines on vaulting and uneven
parallel bars. Pitt started on bars,
while Penn State started vaulting.

Freshman Gina Venezia per-
formed a nice set but fell on a
release move, dropping her score
to 8.2.

Sophomores Kathy Wallish and
Carrie Carnesale picked up the
pace, hitting for an 8.65 and a
9.0, respectively.

Junior captain Shelly Sleith had
one fall, but scored well with a
8.75; Freshman Jen Butkovich
and sophomore Jeannie Vecchio
were Pitt's high scorers on bars
with a 9.15 and 9.45, respec-
tively.

Going into vaulting, Pitt was

only trailingPSU. by three-tenths I _

of a point. Although Pitt scored
its highest vaulting total of the
year, they couldn't surpass PSU’s
bar scores, which ranged from
9.2 to 9.75.

Venezia scored 9.05, as did
senior Trish Aser. Sophomore
Tina Taylor scored 9.0 and But-
kovich followed with a 9.1.

- Sleith and Carnesale were con-
sistent, earning 9.35 and 9.45.
Carnesale p|ace'd second on the

V, event, tying with PSU’s Debbie

O’Brian.

On the floor exercise, But-
kovich stepped out of bounds on
her first tumbling pass and scored
8.75. Venezia had one of her best
floor routines of the year and
scored an 8.8.

’’I thought Gina was a little un-

Freshman swimmer Noelle
Barry has lived in four differ-
ent states, has traveled to Eu-
rope and South America, and
is settling in just fine toher col-

_ lege career here at Pitt.

' Barry is already the top but-
terflier for the Pitt women's
swim team, and head coach
David Belowich is excited to
see how much better she will
get.

’’I’m delighted with her
progress this year,” said Be-
lowich. ”She’s just starting to
learn how talented she is; she
can keep getting stronger and
stronger.”

Although Barry spent much
of her younger years in New
Jersey and Arizona, she did
not become interested
swimming until she moved to
Florida. Barry liked the inten-
sity of high school swimming
there and the importance
placed on the sport.

But Barry only swam her
freshman year in high school
in Florida before moving to

North Carolina. High School
swimming was not as big
there, so Barry concentrated

Associated Press Writer

COLUMBIA, S.C.‘ — South
Carolina reached into Division
I—AA and named Appalachian
State's Sparky Woods its foot-
ball coach Tuesday, ending a
search that began just over

0 two weeks ago following the

sudden death ofloe Morrison.

”This is a job where I don't
think you ever need another
job in this business,” Woods
said. ”If [the] goal is to be the
very best and reach the very

top, then I feel like we're here.
All we've got to do is succeed
at it.”

Woods said he would meet
soon with the Gamecock play-
ers and the assistant coaches
still on the staff. He hoped to
have a complete staff by the
time spring practice begins
March 13.

’’I think he's got a fire in his
stomach. He's got a lot of en-
thusiasm,” Presidentjames B.

also made me appreciate my fa-
mily more. They were always
there.” .

Other than her family, Barry is
not inspired or motivated by
many of the things that get other
athletes going.

”For me goals don't do much,
they don't inspire me,” said Bar-
ry. ”It’s really in my mind how
I'm going to swim. If the team
needs me, I want to come
through for them. That inspires
me a lot.’’

Barry is looking forward to the
Eastern Championships coming
up this weekend at Penn State,
but more from a team standpoint
than an individual one.

”I want to see the team have a

ood overall standing,” said Bar-
ry. ’’I’d like theteam to go in
there -and show that we have a
really strong team. For myself, I
just want to go my best times and
-come out of the season knowing
I improved.”

Barry has a chance to qualify
for the NCAA meet coming in
March as part of a relay team. She
admits her chances for qualifying

individually are pretty slim for
this year, but she would like to
qualify by her junior year and
build a good reputation for her-
self as a swimmer. She confesses
that will be difficult, considering
the tough competition in the but-
terfly events.

According to Belowich, this is
not out of reach for Barry.

”She has a nice, relaxed swim-
ming style. She needs to be a lit-
tle more aggressive and get a little
more confidence; add that with
more experience in big meets,
and she'll be able to achieve
those things,” said Belowich.

Perhaps Barry's best perfor-
manceof the year was at Vil lano-
va. Barry won the 200-meter
butterfly race by over a full se-
cond and was the only swimmer
to swim the 100-butterfly in un-
der a minute. She was also part
of a victorious 200-medley relay
team.

Barry's best memories of the ‘

year include the Penn State meet
and the Virginia meet.

Carnesale hit a career-high all-
around score of 36.6, edging out
PSU’s Debbie O’Brian for second
place. ”I want to hit a 37.00 this
year,” Carnesale said.

After a close match at PSU Fri-
day night, the Lady Panthers were
worn out for their tri-meet Sunday
at Kent State with the University
of Illinois.

Pitt managed to defeat the
University of Illinois
178.45—167.90 but couldn't edge
out Kent State's 179.65.

Pitt started out on vaulting,
where they scored their lowest

vault total all season. Yohman

was disappointed with some of
the scores given by the judges,
but she added that the low scores
didn't affect the team's attitude
for the rest of the meet.

”The kids were frustrated, but
it made them more determined,”
she said.

Taylor placed third with an 8.8,
and Carnesale won the event
with a 9.15.

Pitt chalked up a few good rou-
tines on the uneven parallel bars,
with Wallish’s 8.7, Butkovich’s
9.2 and Vecchio’s 9.4. According
to Yohman, Butkovich performed
the best routine she's done all
season. Vecchio placed third on
the event. ‘

On floor exercise, Pitt's floor
routines were up and down.
Freshman Tracy lung was missing
some difficulty in her routine,
dropping her score to 7.75, but
Aser came back with a good rou-
tine for an 8.75.

Venezia scored an 8.9, which
seemed low to Yohman, who
said, ”She did the best double
back I've ever seen her do.”

Wallish, Carnesale and Taylor
were consistent, scoring 9.0, 9.2
and 9.3, respectively. Carnesale
tied for third and Taylor won the
event

Pitt only trailed Kent State by
one point after the first three
events. Their last event was the
balance beam —— the event that
either makes or breaks a team.

In this case, the Lady Panthers
did well but still couldn't catch
up to Kent State. ”I was really

pleased with the beam squad,”
Yohman said.

Wallish started off with an
8.75. Taylor, who had fallen
twice at PSU Friday, came back
strong with a good routine
despite a fall for a 9.05. _

Venezia hit for a 9.0-and Aser
scored 8.95, despite grabbing the
beam to prevent a fall.

Sleith had some trouble on
beam, falling twice for a 7.75.
”She just wasn't quite on,” Yoh-
man said.

Carnesale nailed her beam rou-
tine, placing second with a 9.3.
She also placed third in the all-
around with a 36.10.

”We had two really good
meets last weekend. I think [the
team will] get more aggressive,”
Yohman said.

dual meet. —

B-ball tickets bank on long tradition

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Every Monday, thousands of
University of Pittsburgh students
find themselves standing in line
at the ticket window of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, waiting diligent-
ly for their chance to pick up a
Panther student basketball ticket.

Most don't mind waiting in
line, even though some will be
turned away after the 2,000 allot-
ted tickets are distributed. After
all, unlike at the remaining eight
Big East schools, these tickets are
free to students with validated
l.D.s.

’’It’s just a long-standing
process,” said Pitt ticket manager
Dick Lukehart. ”All the years I've
been here, we've just sent a cer-
tain amount of tickets down to

the ticket office and let the stu-
dents have them.”

Student tickets at Villanova cost
$6 per game, and Georgetown
tickets run $12.

The Big East Conference
schools — Georgetown, Pitt,
Providence, Seton Hall, Syracuse,
St. John's, Boston College, Con-
necticut and Villanova — have a
revenue-sharing program that
equally distributes funds from Big
East ventures among the pro-
grams, but Lukehart said that
does not include student ticket al-
locations from the other schools.

”I don't know what the Big East
revenue-sharing rules are, but I
believe that they only apply to
the post-season Big East Tourna-
ment,” added Lukehart.

Pitt's athletic director, Dr. Ed-
ward Bozik, said that gate
receipts, including student ticket
revenue from the other league
schools, are not shared among
schools.

Bozik said that although the
free tickets are not an issue now,
student football tickets used to be
distributed in much the same
manner as basketball tickets.

”This issue was raised about 10
years ago, and a fee was put on
student football tickets,” Bozik

said. ”The money goes to the
Office of Student Affairs and
some also goes to the Student
Government Board.”

Pitt student football tickets are
approximately $9 for a season.

Lukehart said that on-campus
basketball games compare to
football games at Pitt Stadium in
terms of splitting the revenue.

”We now pay the visiting team
a dollar amount to come here
and play,’' Lukehart said.

The Panthers lose, or rather,
never gain, a good amount of
revenue due to the free distribu-
tion of student tickets. Prior to this
season, there was a waiting list of
approximately 1,000 people
wishing to purchase season tick-
ets for Pitt home games, accord-
ing to Lukehart.

The plush chair seats in Pitt's
Fitzgerald Field House cost $192
for the season, and bleacher seats
run $128.

Despite the cost of funding a
growing basketball program at
Pitt, Lukehart said the subject of
discontinuing free student ticket
distribution has never been
broached.

’’I don't think anybody up here
is thinking about it,” said Luke-
hart, referring to the administra-
tors in the athletic office in Pitt
Stadium.

Pitt's basketball team has be-
come one of the premiere pro-
grams in the country over the past
four years. With its growing repu-
tation comes a need to accom-
modate more fans.

The Fitzgerald Field House cur-
rently seats 6,798 and is the third-
smallest arena in the Big East.

Plans for a 12 to 15,000-seat
arena have been rumored, and
Bozik said should that arena ever
become reality, the policy of free
student tickets would be
reviewed.

”It would really depend on
how you had to pay for your are-
na,” Bozik said, adding that most
schools_have set aside funds for
construction of such facilities.

”West Virginia University
[which built its 14,000-seat
Coliseum for $10.4 million in
1970], for example, has a sur-
charge built into every one of its
tickets for bonded-indebtedness,”
Bozik said.

Bonner, just moments after her
win in the hurdles, set aside her
fatigue and finished second in the
55 meter dash with a time of
7.13, further extending the Pitt
lead.

Minutes later Michelle Bennet
of Villanova ranthe 500 in a Big
East record time of 1:11.45, but
the Panthers lost little ground as
Hope Ardythe came from behind
to pull out a second place with
a time of 1:14.01.

Pitt's Keisha Demas, the winner
of last year's 400 dash, repeated
her performance with a seeming-
ly effortless victory in a time of
55.78. Demas led from the open-
ing gun and was never
challenged.

Alexis Archer further padded
the Pitt lead with a second-place

finish in the triple jump. Archer's ~

jump of 1 1.82 meters was second
only to Janeen Bonner’s of Syra-
cuse, who set a Big East record
with a jump of 12.30 meters.
Bonner, a three-time Big East

' champ in the long jump and tri-

ple jump, was named outstand-

on said the 35-year-old coach
”has the characteristics we
were looking for — unques-
tionable integrity, strong
character, student-athlete
oriented [thinking], and a
genuine feeling and concern
for young people.”

Woods said he had three
goals: ”[students’ graduating],
[winning] football games 

and [having] fun while we're
doing it.”
While he wants to have fun,
Woods conceded to some jit-
, ters about his new job — and
a 1989 schedule that includes
Clemson, Georgia, Florida
‘State and North Carolina State.
”l’m nervous about them
all. Right now, Duke makes
me nervous and that's the first
ball game.  I'm nervous but

I’m not intimidated at all,”
Woods said.

Dixon said while terms of"
Woods’ contract have not all
been defined, it will probably
be a 5-year deal.

Woods said he felt a bit
overwhelmed at the jump to a

major Division I football pro- ‘

gram, but had no qualms
about accepting the offer.

- ’’If they wanted me as much
as I wanted them, then we're
very happy with each other,”

head coach at the University
of South Carolina. '

”I’m very sorry that it oc- _

curred because of the death of
Coach Morrison. But I'm excit-
ed about carrying on with the
tradition of winning that he
has established here,” Woods
said.

Woods coached the I-AA
Mountaineers to Southern
Conference titles in 1986 and
1987 and was named the
league's coach of the year an
unprecedented three straight

times, beginning in 1985.

previous Big East record.

When it was over, the Lady
Panthers had amassed a total of
121 points, compared to 99 for
second-place St. John's and 95 for
third-place Villanova. i

Pitt athletes Deborah Bonner,,

Demas, Archer and Dudley each
individually outscored the entire
women’s_teams from Boston Col-
lege and Seton Hall combined.

Bonner received the award for
outstanding female performance
for her first place in the 55
hurdles‘. ‘

’’I’m on top of the world,” Bon-
ner said. ”From being last a few
years ago to winning it this year,
it feels great. The Villanova dy-

nasty is broken; we finally beat '

them.”

Coach Steve Lewis first thanked
the entire Pitt coaching staff and
then saluted his seniors.

”We have five seniors that we
built this program ‘on. They are
the ones that got us here.”

.' ' The Panther victory was all the

sweeter for Lewis because of the
quality of competition the wom-
en prevailed over.

”We were up against one of
the best teams in the country in

..__Villanova..l’m just happy to be
