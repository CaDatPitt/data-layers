Or, A Cracker Barrel Dispatch
From Mr. McCo-nkey

By WINSTON MCCONKEY
University Debater
Special Correspondence to The Pitt News

HANOVER, N. H., April 21—VVith
a cry of “Skoal to the “North,” the Perl-
patetic Pitt1nen—-Boyle and ll/IcConkey,
Pitt debaters, accompanied by Coach
W. M. Parrish — have visited Penn
State, Cornell, Colgate and Middlebury
colleges.

The last two colleges sent debat-
ing teams out against the Pittmen and
in both cases, withdrew with their
wounded follo*.vin_:_: audience decisions.

A lighter episode occurred when the
debaters stopped at New York’s fa-
mouse Buttermilk Falls, which drop
500 feet through gorge and whirlpool
a froth of milk-white water. Upon
parking the expedition’s auto---and
before debaters Boyle and McConkey
could remonstrate——D-r. Parrish was
well up the steep side of the gorge,
With what was later described as the
abandon of a mountain goat.

The debaters followed in a hot and
bre.a.t‘n-taking climb.

“Doctor, what ever made you plunge
up..a _.Inountain l.ike this?” panted
Boyle. , 3

“Well,” said Dr. Parrish, “I had
noticed that it was just 8:40 o’clock,
a.nd I must ha.ve been thinking of my
class in Alumni ha1l.”

At Colgate the debaters were asked
about the House investigation and
about the Cathedral. Colgate men
pointed to their own pride, a cemetery
reserved for members of the adminis-
tration alone, and called it the most
exclusive fraternity on the campus.

At New York’s rococo State House
at Albany, where weighty problems of
state such as the banning of nudism
are consi.,d_ered, Dr. Parrish declared
-that the heavily upholstered swivel
chairs in the Assembly chamber were
the most: coznfortable he had ever en-
countered.

'l‘ired by the long drive, the coach
soon dropped off for forty winks, just

No More Batching
For Batchelcler

In the University directory of oili-
cers, ‘faculty, and clerical assistants,
an unmarried person has an asterisk
in front of his name. If a new direc-
tory were to appear this week at least
two names now starred would not have
the decoration, for last Friday Miss
Marjorie Vvolford, secretary to the
principal of the Falk Elementary
school, became the bride of Endicott

registrar.

The ceremony took place at the Wol-
ford home, Miss Louise Wolford act-

best man, and Dr. Harold Dalzell, as-
sistant pastor at the Shadyside Pres-
byterian church, reading the service.

Legislative Meet

Students, Instructor To Attend
Two-Day Session Tomorrow;
Earle To Open Conclave

 

Fifteen University delegates to the
student legislative Coiiference leave
tomorrow for Harrisburg to attend a
two-d:-.y session that opens Friday. .

Those who will attend, accompanied!
by Dr. Roger Shumate, inst.ruc.tor in
political science are: Louis Weis-

Governor George H. _E'arle_. who will
welcome the collegians, says of this
nieetiugz “I hope that, in meeting
as a, model legislature this year as if
your model constitution were in ef-
fect, you will demonstrate graphically
just what. great steps we might take
if we could work under a more flex-
ible and 21 more modern constitution.”

The se.:reta.ry of the commonwealth,
David 1.. Lawrence, has expressed him-
self thus: “I have always felt that
text.-book training, while absolutely
essential .for..._intellig.c_11t ,apprecia_tion
of .ao'rernmen't, was not of itself suf-
licicnt, but should be suppleiiiented by
s.ct.ual experience.”

The conference, which is completely

one of the following ton committees:
education, industrial relations, judicial
organization, local government, natural
resources and public utilities, old age

Mellon Institute Strides

Toward Pneumonia Cure‘

 

By Harold Hoffman

In his 22nd annual report to the
board of trustees of M-":l10I1 Institute.
just released, Dr. E. R. Weidlein, di-
rector, has revealed the progress made
by members of the Institute during the
year er-1’-ed March 1.

According to the report. $596,937,
an increase of 11 per cent, was con-
tributed by industries for the support
of research, inakinpg a total of more
than ten million dollars for the past
24 years. Fifty-six industrial research
programs were carried on by workers
during the past year.

The‘ most signiﬁcant of the pro-
grams has been the fight against
pneumonia, centered in the depart-
ment of research in pure chemistry, by
the use of various serums and chem-
icals. Utiliziug the facilities at Mel-
lon Institute and local hospitals, Dr.
C. L. Butler, Dr. Alice Renfrew, and
Dr. Leonard H. Cretcher, assisted by
a corps of workers, have made deﬁnite

progress.
The workers at the Institute and
Mercy hospital have concentrated

their efforts on 59 quinine derivatives
and compounds. To date, the most
interesting of the compounds to be
studied are, hydroxyetliylhydrocupre-
inc, apoquinine, ethylapoquinine, and
11ydroxythylapoquinine. These four
drugs--have been studied both in the

test.-tube and on laboratory animals
with convincing success.
Five collaborators at the ‘Mercy

hospital, Drs. W. V’. G._ Maclachlan,
H. H. Permar, John M. Johnston, Jo-
seph R. Kennedy, and H. B. Burchell
have gathered biological and clinical
data. Besides Dr. Butler, Dr. Cretcher,
and Dr. Renfrew. the Institute staff
on. this problem consists of Dr. B. L.
Souther, and Miss Mary Housler. The
ﬁndings of the department are being
published at signiﬁcant stages in the
development of the work. Twelve sci-
entists; under the direction of Dr. "RI
R. Mellon, are working at West Penn
hospital on the biological control of
pneumonia by serums.

Other research specialists have
made considerable progress. Dr. C.
‘W. Sweitzer has developed a new

black lacquer, while Vt’. J. Balswin has
carried into the plant stage an im-
proved method of enameling. A tile-
faced metal that has already been ac-
cepted in the building trades has been
created by D. S. Hubbel. The refrac-
tory fellowship, headed by S. M.
Phelps, has developed a process for
the control of commercial products
during their niaiiufacture.

During the past two years Dr. B. H.
Giliztore has conducted research on
soap and has succeeded in demonstrat-
ing the adjuvant _value of “C‘.algo1-,”
now being used in laundering and me-
chanical disliwashing. Drs. ‘JV. VV.

lfmecker and C. R. Payne have dis-
covere-.l a sulphur compound that has
protecting agent

proved a valuable

against acids and other corrosive sub-
stances. A p1'oc.edure that aids in
sharpening razor blades and selecting
hardened steel has been developed by
E. J. Casselman. The fellowship in
organic: synthesis was successful in a.
wide variety of ﬁelds.

Two new strained baby foods have
been made by the food varieties fel-
lowship, headed by E. R. Harding. Dr.
G. J. (‘ox~and.Miss ~Mary Doods have
concluded that there is a substance
that is valuable to the growth of
healthy teeth, when present in the diet
during tooth forniation.

-During the calendar year 1934, 11
bulletins, 19 research reports, and 41
other reports were published by mem-
bers of the institute. Fifty-two Ameri-
can and 49 foreign patents were issued
to fellows.

The new building of the Institute
will gradually be occupied during
1935. The chemical engineering quar-
ters are almost -ﬁnished, and many of
the laboratories will be ready for oc-
cupancy within the next few months.
The building is to be completed by the
end of this year.

Trackmen Head Eastward

For Annual

Relay Carnival

 

Panthers Open Season Withzvictory Over-‘Temple Owls";
Two Olsonmen, Peacock Smash Stadium Marks

 

Getting favorable breaks in the draw for starting lanes, the
Panther trackmen head for Philadelphia tomorrow morning where
tliey will compete 111 the nation ’s foremost track carnival, the Penn

Relays, on Friday and Saturday.

" Of the ‘eight-rel'a‘y'-te’an1s €I1teIi‘€(l“ll1Tlle meet, tlirec lof'th’em‘-drew"
pole positions, those being the t.wo-mile, four-niile, and 880-yard
teams. The ﬂashy mile relay combine and the distance-medley quar-

tet got ﬁfth lane positions, while the:

440-yard and sprint medley groups ob-
tained places outside the number 10
lane.

The Kiger, Grout, McDonald. Con-
nclly combination will be defending ti-
tleholders in the Class B college mile-
1'ela_v_. having won this event for the
last. two years. Last year they came’
within four-tenths of a second of
breaking the carnival mark, speeding
the mile in 3 minutes, 20.8 seconds.

‘Olson will proba.bl,v use Fleming,
Menaker, Kiger, and Schlossberg in
the sprint events. In the two-mile re-
lay, the team will be composed prob-
ably of G-roat, Leggin, Connelly. and
Tost. ‘Wagenhouser, Kirkpatrick,
Tosi. Miusico, and Albright will be
used for work in the distance relays.

-Coach .Pott's, freshman ‘mile-relay;
team will probably‘ be- made up of
Thomas, McConnell, Van Kennan, and
Pustik.

In addition to the relay entries, 01-
son has entered several men in the
individual events.

Trample Temple

The runners got off to a ﬂying start
against Temple last Saturday in their
ﬁrst dual meet of the season, sending
the Owls back to Philadelphia with a
95%,-391,4. trouncing. In all, three sta-
dium marks fell by the wayhwiththe
Panther lads accounting for two and
Tempie’s one-nmn track team, Eulace
Peacock, setting the other one.

Taano, sophomore star, opened the
afternoon festivities at the bowl by
tossing the javelin 198 feet for a new
mark in this event. The Panthers
monopolized all three places in the
javelin, Gongloff getting second and
Sowiski taking third.

'.l‘emple’s E-ulace Peacock showed
the large number of track fans present
why he deserves to be rated with
Owens and l\'Ietcalf=:=. by doing the 100-
yaid dash in 9.6 seconds. This _fea.t
gave the stadium record books a new
mark. Fleming, Pitt star, trailed Pea-
cock by the scant margin of two steps.

Fleming tied his recoid for the 220-
low hurdles, hitting the tape in the
fast time of 2-1.6 seconds.

Record No. 3 went to Bud Great,
who ran a beautii‘ul race in the 880-
_v-ard run to set up a new mark of 1
iziiiiute, 56.4 seconds for that dis-
tance. Groat took the lead at the
start and gradually increased his ad-
vantage. throughout the race.

Peacock, with 16 points, led the
scorers. Bouavita anclFlemingeacl1l1ad

in the shot and llammer events; Flem-
ing getting his points from a. first in

Translating the synibols, the Tokyo

telephone operator says, "Tire connection
is made—— go ahead, please.” Meaning
that now you can talk to Japan from any
telephone in the Bell System.

Interestingly, Japanese was the first
foreign language ever transmitted by tele-
phone--when in the winter of 1876-77
three Japanese students at Harvard
visited Alexander Graham Bell in Boston.
These men have lived to see the day
when they can talk with Boston from
their homeland!

Seeking to put the whole world on such
easy speaking terms, Bell System service
now enables you to reach more than 93%

of the world’s 33,000,000 telephones.
