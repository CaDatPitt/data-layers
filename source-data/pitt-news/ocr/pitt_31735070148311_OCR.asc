“Part of the challenge is’[that] Iam

I know that some of the groups have

Stavrakos hasn’t requested any do-

Pooja Patel, a sophomore who,
like Stavrakos, is runningfor the ﬁrst
time this year, has already worked
for the Board as chairperson of the
academic affairs committee. She and
the other two candidates on her slate,

Pitt Eirst, have each spent $200 on the
campaign, ordering two banners and

I 75 T-shirts.

Patel and her slate mates, who are

before and normally does not get
the shot.

“I don’t think there’s anything
wrong with [the vaccine], it’s just
not necessary unless you’re prone
to getting the ﬂu,” she said.

But Ronak Patel, a cardiology fel-
low at UPMC, received his injection
of the vaccine earlier this month,
and said that he got his shot “so that

 my patients don’t contract the ﬂu,

on my behalf.”
Patel hasn’t gotten his shot every
year. Two years ago, hemissed get-

' ting the shot and was infected with

H1N1, a type of ﬂu popularly called
“swine ﬂu” that infected 43,771
Americans that year, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

He recalls the illness as “the sick-
est I’ve ever been.” After that experi-
ence, Patel said he makes sure to get
vaccinated.

For the 2010-2011 ﬂu season,
8,227 people were hospitalized
because of the ﬂu, according to the
Health Industry Distributors As-
sociation.

Nicole Cerussi, the manager at
Falk Pharmacy, said that it is purely
a coincidence when people get sick

Flu shot a health boon

after their shot. They could have
been exposed to an illness before
receiving the shot, and the shot does
not protect against an already grow-
ing virus. .

Sixth—year pharmacy students
Kate Steward and Ashleigh Hogue,
who volunteer through the School
of Pharmacy, have been handing out
information to students on campus
to inform them of the beneﬁts of the
ﬂu vaccination.

Steward has had her ﬂu shot
because she does a lot of traveling
and is a UPMC employee, though
employees are not required to get
the vaccine. She said that for those
people who decide not to get the vac-
cine and become infected with the
virus, they are out of luck. “There
really is no treatment,” she said.

‘Accordingto the CDC, there is no
exact number of how many people
die from the ﬂu each year, though
the most common estimate for every
year is 36,000 deaths worldwide.
Ninety percent of those deaths occur
in people ages 65 and older.‘

“College students aren’t likely to
die from the ﬂu, but it’s kind of 5
bummer to miss a big event because
you were sick in bed for two days,”
Zimmerman said. I

Landreneau said that Sodexo
wanted to host the event. Lan-
dreneau has worked with Sodexo
through the food committee this
semester.

Rosenkaimer said that she got
a call onTuesday from a Sodexo
public relations employee saying
that the_Pitt Blue slate had set up a
campaigning opportunity in Market
Central, and she wanted to offer the
opportunity to all of the candidates
over the next few days.

Rosenkaimer said she then im-
mediately contacted all of the other
candidates via email to notify them
of the event in case they wanted
to attend.

Pooja Patel, a candidate running
for Board on the Pitt First slate, said
she found out about the event too
late, but Market Central was hold-
ing another event Wednesday night
so she opted to not attend the Tues-
day event.

“I think I would have an issue _

with it if I couldn’t go tomorrow,”
she said, referring to the meet and
greet held Wednesday at Market
Central.

A Presidential candidate John
Hasley, who is running on the Pan-
ther Pride slate, said he didn’t ﬁnd

before it happened.

“I would have wanted to know
about it sooner so I could have

The event included the slates
talking to students in the dining

hall, which was decorated with each

 

slate’s signs, anda blue and gold 

cake, provided by Sodexo.

“We do desserts anyway, so we
usually put cake out at night,” Fuku-
shima said. “We didn’t do anything
above what we would normally do,
we just allowed students to serve
the food.” ,

Rosenkaimer said that the can-

those meetings. She said she had 
no say in the Market Central event 
and assumed that Landreneau and 

Sodexo set it up.

Rosenkaimer said that before 
elections began, she tried to de- 
ﬁne the elections code more thor— 5,
oughly to include what counts as 
campaigning together and what ,

counts as slates endorsing each
other. But she said the Board disap-
proved her plan. “I did not change

OurSGB

endorsement  

Every year, students confront seem-
ingly unsolvable problems: tuition
hikes, transportation deﬁciencies,
etc. But today, anyone who signs onto
mypitteduhasanopportiinitytoalter
the course of Pitt history by voting in
the Student Government Board elec-
tion. _

Ifyou didn’t experience a swell
of civic pride reading the preceding
lines, you’re probably not alone. Only
19 percent of students voted in last
year’s election, and only 12 percent in
the election before that. Few on cam-

pus seemto know— orcare-——about,

SGB; at best, the Board is generally
recognized as the overseer of club ﬁ-
nances.

But whether or not people realize
it, SGB’s inﬂuence extends beyond stu-
dent organizations. We wouldn’t enjoy
freeaccessto The NewYorkTimes and
USA Today, for instance, if it weren’t
for previous President Charlie Shull
and current President Molly Stieber.
At the very least, students should
 themselves with the two
current presidential candidates,_]ohn
Hasley andjames Landreneau, before
dismissing today’s election as incon-
sequential.

Hasley, a senior history and phi-
losophy major, has campaigned on

three main initiatives: sending Board '

members to club meetings to ensure
both parties understand each other,
reforming the New York Times/USA
Today readership program so that
the papers are only available to non-

College of General Studies under— .

graduate students who paid for them
and moving Board members’ office
hours to public spaces like Litchﬁeld
Towers Lobby. “

Landreneau, a senior chemical
engineering major with a certiﬁcate
in nuclear energy, also emphasizes
ti1reeinitiatives:assigningeachBoard
member a series of clubs to contact
on a regular basis, mostly to clarify
why allocaﬁons decisions were made;
esmblishingmonthly Pitthallsessions
during which attendants could ask
Board members questions; and cre-
ating an on—campus Student Leader
Summit

Earlierthisweek, we met individu-
allywith both Hasley and Landreneau
to discuss their proposals and, more

broadly, their reasons for running.
Now, after deliberating amongst our-
selves, we’ve decidedwhich candidate

> to endorse.

That candidate is James Lan-
dreneau.

We’re skeptical that Landreneau’s
Pitt hall sessions will attract large
crowds — as mentioned, most stu-

'dents couldn’t care less about SGB —

but we do think his Leader Summit is
asureﬁre way to bolster campus-wide
camaraderie. We also commend Lan-
dreneau’s proposal, mentioned during
our meeting and Tuesday night’s de-
bate, to ease the transition from one
allocations committee to the next —
in part by changing the ‘allocations
manual each year to accommodate
changing voting precedents.

We’re also impressed with Lan-
dreneau’s track record as a Board
member. This year, Landreneau over-
saw the installation of an easy—to-use
swipe-in entrance system at Towers,
a feature that will soon spread to all
residence halls. And during the sum-
mer, he helped renovate the OCC pro-
gram —- an overhaul that, although not
without its ﬂaws, was still indisputably
a step in the right direction.

This isn’tto say Hasley doesn’talso
have important accomplishments to
his name, amongthem the implemen-
tation of a Blackboard smart phone
app. But we remain unconvinced that
his initiatives would amount to any-
thing truly signiﬁcant. .

We also ﬁnd Hasley’s attendance
record at SGB meetings troubling
— right now, the candidate has ﬁve
absences while Landreneau has two,
according to Stieber. When his ab-
sences were mentioned during our
interview, Hasley said he would only
miss a meeting as president under
dire circumstances, whereas now, al-
though heassuredustherewas no way
he could have avoided the absences,
hewas “just another Board member.”
We hardly think that’s an adequate
rationalization.

Ultimately, however, today’s
election presents a choice between
two strong presidential candidates.
Whether or not you agree with our
endorsement, exercise your right to
make a difference just this once: Head
to my.pitI.edu and vote. I

THE STAMATIACK

Columnist

I’m surprised you’re even read-
ing this right now — I thought
the excitement of Student Gov-
ernment Board elections would
preoccupy students for the day.

Given that 18 candidates are
campaigning on at least three
proposals each, there’s certainly
a lot to be excited about. All you
need to do is rank the platforms
by preference, then choose the
six candidates whose ideas best
match yours. Then, just sit back
and let democracy make every-
thing better.

I’m pretty sure nobody’s do-
ing this. _ ‘

I suspect that, to many, SGB
is just a gloriﬁed high school
student council. We hold elec-
tions, people win and then. the
victors sit in a special room a
few times a week. It seems like
nothing ever happens because
the Board members wield no real
power. Even if we agree on the
ideas candidates are _circulat-
ing —- this year we have green
roofs, South Oakland lighting
and expanded Safe Rider routes,
among others — there seems to
be little reason to get excited be-
cause nothing ever happens.

In actuality, depending on

Nick Stamatakis .

ﬁne success, the out-

how you de-

going Board kept anywhere
from one-third to half of its
promises. This year’s two presi-

dential candidates, John Hasley
andjames Landreneau, each ac-
complished something concrete:
a Blackboard smart phone app
and a swipe-in system at Tow-
ers, respectively. For what it’s
worth, politifact.com estimates
that President Barack Obama has
kept or compromised on roughly
a third of his promises, although
he still has a year to go. Make

of it what you will that Obama -

and SGB have comparable suc-
cess rates.

It_ probably wasn’t ineffec-
tive leadership or laziness that
precluded widespread change.
It’s more likely that the popu-
lar conception of SGB isn’t .far
off the mark — there isn’t a lot
of practical power inherent in
Board’s positions. And because
many of the Board’s funding deci-
sions would probably not change
much regardless of who’s on top,
voting for candidates at this level

_ is arguably not that critical.

This isn’t the case with the

president, however. Molly Stie- ‘
ber, who currently holds the

  “‘$-“mollallﬁe if the sen gm’. 0”

  
   
  

position, has
‘ actually achieved
_ all three of her
campaign propos-

the inclusion of more
electronic books at The
Book Center, served as a
clear student voice in communi-

, eating with the city and state and

created the promised SGB~spon-
sored Allocations 101 sessions
earlier this year to help clubs
understand the often confusing
process.

Does Stieber’s success mean
she’s simply more competent
than everybody else‘? I hardly
find this explanation satisfying.
Although the Board itself does
resemble a high school student
council — a sort of vague liaison
between administrators and stu-
dents -— the president position
does have some leverage. Per-
haps this power is not derived
from any legislative mechanism,
but rather the prestige of the po-
sition.

So although apathy toward
the Board is understandable,
everybody should take keen in-
terest at least in the presidential
race between Landreneau and
Hasley. Whoever wins this race

will impact your life as a Pitt student.

Landreneau’s three primary campaign
goals are establishing SGB liaisons for
speciﬁc campus groups, creating a Stu-
dent Leader Summit and holding monthly
open forums in which students can pose
questions to Board members.]ohn Hasley
wants to allow SGB members to meet with
student organizations, ensure that only
non—College of General Studies students
have access to the The New York Times
and USA Today newspapers provided to
students through the readership program,
and institute public ofﬁce hours in places
like Towers Lobby or the Union.

So, for the 81 percent of you who didn’t
vote in last year’s elections: One of these
two people will win, and one of these two
different series of initiatives will take
effect. Landreneau’s focus is on creating
institutions that connect student groups
to SGB. Hasley’s focus is similar, but cen-
ters more on preventing freeloading by
making it impossible for non-"students to
get free newspapers.

Of course, this isn’t a United States
presidential race: A vote for Landreneau’s
openness platform isn’t a vote against
Hasley’s anti—freeloading platform.‘ But
because the student presidential vote mat-

your preferences with candidates’ platforms

ters, and because the president’s power
comes from his or her passion about spe-
cific issues, it’s up to the campus to decide
which one of these visions we prefer.

Is the biggest problem with SGB, and
Pitt in general, the miscommunication
between student groups? If so, vote for
Landreneau. Or do you agree with Has—'
ley and think that the problem with SGB
and Pitt is the misallocation of student
resources and the abuse of the reader-
ship program?

Go to my.pitt.edu and decide. The state
of campus next year depends on who you
choose. —

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND

Pick up a basketball, get in a workout before the weekend

BY ANDREW GRETCHKO

When the Pitt men’s and women’s
basketball teams take to the court,

they’re surrounded by more than '.

12,000 seats in the Petersen Events

Center. For regular Pitt students,

things are a little bit different.
Our options are limited to Trees

Hall and Belleﬁeld Hall — a total ~

of four courts for a student body
numbering close to 29,000. But if
you’re like me, you haven’t let this
stop your quest to lace up a few
times.a week for some games of
pick-up hoops.

A workout in itself, the walk up
to Trees Hall from lower campus
can be daunting. After passing
the Pete, you have to make your

way up yet another hill. Then you P

canﬁnally swipe your ID at the
front desk. Starting up the ﬂight
of stairs, you can usually tell if the
trek was worth your while; the
sounds of basketball shoes stick-
ing to hardwood and the clanking

of basketballs off rims are always
a good sign. Rounding the corner,
you are ﬁnally face-to-face with
your opponent.

The court closest to you gener-
ally draws solid competition, made
up mostly of those who played for
their high school or haveenough
love for the game to come up to
Trees regularly. The middle court
is reserved, for the cream of the
crop and if you can’t dunk, you
might want to move on. The court
at the far end of the gym some-
times.remains open for stragglers

. to shoot around, but on crowded

days will also be covered with 10
competitors playing games of First
To Eleven by ones and twos, call
your own fouls. .
This may seem daunting at ﬁrst,
but much like calculus or chemis-
try, Trees has a formula to it. Gen-
erally speaking, if you head up to
Trees on a Friday around 5 p.m.,

you’re going to have to wait a game

or two before you get on the court.
The weekend has officially started
and people are trying to get in a
last—second workout before head-
ing offifco indulge over the week-
end. Thanks to college schedules,
Thursdays are much the same and
all three courts are usually taken.
This crowd will stayfor an hour
or two, running full-court games
until 7 p.m., when Trees tends to
empty out. On a normal weeknight,
you may still be able to ﬁnd a game
if you come up at this time, but
on Thursdays and Fridays people

‘ seem to be in a hurry to get started
. with their night.

Belleﬁeld, on the opposite side
of campus, is a completely different

story. A historical landmark, the‘

courts looklike they haven’t been
varnished since Belleﬁeld opened
in 1926 — the court is more like a

MOVIE REVIEW

’Huppy Feel

BY LARISSA GULA

“Happy Feet Two”

Directed by George Miller
Starring Elijah Wood, Robin Wil-
liams, Pink

Grade: D

There are bad sequels, there are
pointless sequels and there are agi-
tating sequels. “Happy Feet Two”
is all three.

Following up with Mumble the
tap-dancing penguin, this animat-
ed ﬁlm takes place not long after
the ﬁrst ﬁlm ends as_Mumble (Eli-
jah Wood)‘and Gloria (Pink) live
happily with their fellow Emperor
penguins trying to raise their son.
After Mumble’s journey outside of
the penguins’ homeland in the ﬁrst
ﬁlm, their society has reformed —
children are taught not only how to
sing, but how to dance.

But Mumble’s son, Erik (E.G.

Two’ tries to pack too much plot into one movie .

Daily), does not ﬁt in with his fel-
low penguins and does not have the
passion for dancing that his father
brought to the group. During a brief

journey with Mumblefs old friend ‘
Ramon (Robin Williams), Erik '

meets a revered bird named The
Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria). Mis-
taking Sven for a penguin that can
ﬂy, Erik makes it his dream to learn
how to do the same. But before he
can return home to his mother and
father, everyone’s world is literally
shaken as melting icebergs cause
disturbances throughout the Ant-
arctic. ,

If this seems like a messy story,
it is. One of this ﬁlm’s biggest ﬂaws
is its fast pacing and attempts to
squeeze too much into a two-hour

running time. The ﬁrst movie was

accused of the opposite problem -—
being too slow —— but it seems that

this ﬁlm has overcorrected.

This problem doesn’t just affect
the plot —— the music and visuals
are overdone, as well. This is pretty
much a long, never—ending music
video with mash-up after mash-up
of bad dance moves and songs with
the lyrics edited to make penguin
jokes.‘ The few lines of dialogue
that aren’t sung are forced, fast
and painful to listen to.

Though it was slow, the origi-
nal “Happy Feet” characters felt
developed and relatable, thanks in
part to some very convincing voice
acting. The fact that the ﬁrst ﬁlm
followed a limited set of characters
over the course of several years led
to a fairly decent, emotional story
told convincingly, albeit slowly._ ‘

“Happy Feet Two” does no such
thing. Instead, it’s too busyjuggling
a bizarre, overcomplicated plot to

even pick a main character or two.
Not once during the ﬁlm is it made
clear whether the main protagonist
is Mumble, his son, Gloria or any
other penguin in the ﬁlm. And come

the end of the ﬁlm, it’s impossible .

to tell what the lesson was. The
value of family? The importance
of -good deeds and of being true to
yourself? That even the smallest
beings can make an impact on their
surroundings? It could have been
any of these — or something else,
for all viewers knew.

Adding to the ﬁlm’s ﬂaws,
Mumble’s parents (played by Hugh
Jackman and Nicole Kidman) have
completely disappeared. And the
character of Gloria feels substan-
tially different since Brittany Mur-
phy, the original voice actress, died.
Plus, in what may have been the
worst decision by the director, the

ﬁlm got an additional two charac-
ters named Bill (Matt Damon) and
Will (Brad Pitt), two krill taking part
in ‘a separate, unrelated journey of
their own.

Remember Sc'rat the saber-
toothed squirrel in the “Ice Age”
ﬁlms? These two krill serve a simi-
lar purpose — they offer pointless,
bad comedy and distract viewers
from the story, effectively ruin-
ing any limitedtension that ever
existed. A

As the ﬁnal nail in the coffin,
while some other recent animated
ﬁlms know how to use 3-D effec-
tively, this one does not". Young
children may be amazed by the
bubbles ﬂoating toward their faces
and may enjoy the return of these
dancing penguins —— butthis time,
few outside of ‘that age group will
feel the same. I

No sophomore slump for artist Drake

BY ANDREW GRETCHKO .  

Take Care

Drake _

Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money,
Universal Republic

A.

1 Unlike most second releases, Drake’s second

album is far from a sophomore slump.

His newest release, Take Care, provides the
usual mix of R&B and club bangers we’ve come
to expect from the Toronto—bom artist. Coming
a longwayfrom his days as Degrassi starjimmy,
Drake continues to impress with both his lyri-
cal and vocal skills. Lil Wayne already told the

world on the track “Money to Blow” that Young
Money, Cash Money Entertainment would “...
be alright if we put Drake on every hook.” And

with his second album, Drake proves that he
can produce far more than a catchy—sounding
hook on someone else’s track.

Right from the start, this album showcases
Drake’s true skills. “We’ll Be Fine,” the ﬁrst song
on Take Care, combines a club beat with Drake’s
gifted, lyrical talent to make a song that’s hard
to take off repeat. The chorus — “I’m trying to
let go of the past / Should we make this one a

shut down. 4

Discussing his rise up from the mixtape
game" to his more recent commercial success,
Drake continues the album with the track “Un—
derground Kings.” This beat is very different
from than that of the more commercial “We’ll
Be Fine” as well as the other more R&B-style
tracks of the album;

But that’s not a bad thing. In fact, this track
has a more aggressive style, one reminiscent of

~ "‘Miss Me” from Drake’s last album, ThankMe

Later, and further proves how multitalented
Drizzy really is. Dealing with the newfound
fame of the past three years, Drake raps, “It’s
been two years since somebody asked me who I
was.” It’s pretty hard to dismiss his fame when
you can barely listen to the radio for a half—hour
without hearing a song by him. As the album
continues, the lyric “I’m the greatest, man, I
said that before I knew I was,” gets harder and
harder to deny. ' i

All club tracks aside, it wouldn’t be a Drake
album if there wasn’t a heavy dose of R&B.
Drizzy showcases his vocals on “Practice,” a
song that moves a little faster than previous
Drake slow jams but still gets sparks ﬂying.
An eight—minute interlude also fulﬁlls the R&B
requirement, as the slow beat allows the words
to linger. The track “DoingIt Wrong” even fea-

/

I

tures Stevie Wonder — what could add more
R&B credit to an album than that?

Other "songs that will soon be played ev-
erywhere include “Make Me Proud,” featur-
ing Drake’s crush Nicki Minaj, and the single
“Headlines.” There’s even a little somethingfor
hip-hop enthusiasts in the song “Lord Knows,”
produced byjust Blaze. This track not only has
bumpin’ bass, but also gives Drake the chance to
show off his lyrical prowess as he speeds along
the driving beat. The darker beat of “HYFR” —
short for Hell Yeah F*ckin’ Right -—- featuring

Young Money, Cash Money artist Lil Wayne also _A

_allows Drake to showcase his skills.

Childish Gumbino shows

BY uz KEENEY

camp

Childish Gambino

Glassnote Records

B+ t . .

Rocks.Like: Early Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco

For comedian Donald Glover, who is best known
as Troy Barnes on NBC’s “Community,” being a
professional funnyman wasn’t enough. Enter a
few mixtapes and an online Wu—Tang Clan name
generator, and Childish Gambinowasbom. Camp,
the new release from Glover’s rapping" alter ego,
is a manic look inside the mind of a man with
many talents.

' Unlike his previous releases — most notably
lastyear’sFreaks and Geeks, whichwas afreneﬁc,
conﬁising shot at rapping — Camp is Glover’s
attempt at settling into his Childish Gambino

. persona. .He still has the same ,enthusiasm.and

bravado, butthistime it makes sense. Freaks and
Geeks conﬁised people because nobody knew
whether to take it seriously or not —— was it just

another joke, some kind ofweirdly executed com—4

edy album? But with Camp, it’s clear that Glover
should be taken seriously. In his song, “Bonﬁre,”
he says he’s like “rap’s stepfather, yeah, you hate
me, but youwill respect.” _ . _

Part ofhis appealisthe subtle earnestnesswith
which he delivers his lyrics. It smacks of a young
Kanye West —— insecure, yet with razor-sharp,

, clever lyrics. Glover is very much in that same _

‘BASKETBALL

Spotty defense leads to defeat

jasketball < 1

Transition defense helped win the
game for Long Beach State: The Pan-
thers allowed 25 fast break points.

“They did a lot to try and stop us
from running, but we’re too fast for
that,” Ware said.

Dixon recognized the 49ers
strength in transition, but mostly
blamed Pitt’s lackluster defense.

“Our transition defense is not
good enough. It hasn’t been good

gough,” Dixon said; ;  _

Offensively, the.Panthers con-
tinued to play inconsistently. They
had 12 turnovers compared to the
49ers’ 10, but still managed to score

’ 76 points.

Once again, Pitt was led by senior
guard Ashton Gibbs, who scored 20
points and shot 8 of 21 from the ﬁeld.
The last lead the Panthers held was
14-12 with 13:02 minutes left in the
ﬁrst half. After losing it, the closest
they got to regaining the lead was

62-56 with 9:53 remaining.

“There were certain spots we were
supposed to be at certain points in the
game, and we weren’t there,” Gibbs
said. “They played harder than us.”

Nasir Robinson played a consis-

tent supporting role throughout,
scoring 19 points to go along with
three rebounds and two assists. Still,
the senior forward felt the effort of
the team was not enough.

“They worked harder, ran harder,
got back to loose balls, executed bet-
ter thanus, outsmarted us,” Robinson
said. “They just wanted it more.”

‘In the second half, the Panthers
switched to a zone defense that had
some spotty success. Long Beach

State was running zone aswell,‘ and '

head coach.Dan Morison ,s;a,i_d,'a big
reason for the zone was Robinson. C‘

“Robinson was a load forus,”
Monson said. “We probably went to
the zone more forhim than anything
else.”

For Long Beach State, the win
was a long time coming. Playing in
a mid-major conference, the 49ers
have faced teams like Duke, Syracuse,

~ Notre Dame and North Carolina over

the last four years without ever get-
ting a major win.

‘‘It’s a great accomplishmen ,”
Ware said. “It’s a big win, we feel
good. But we expected to win this.
We knew we were going to win this
game.”

“First, I want to thank Coach

Djéxon for giving us the opportunity
today,” Morison said. “Alot of coaches
wouldn’t do that. He knew we had a
veteran group coming back, he did it
because he’s a friend and I appreci-
ate the opportunity to come in here
today.” ,
However, Monson stressed that
his team was just getting started.
“This group has not been to an
NCAA tournament yet,” he said.
“That goal for the end of the year is
not attained in one game. We’ve got

3 to play better.”

I I For the Panthers, point guard

T Travon Woodall also had a strong

showing, scoring 17 points on ﬁve of
six shooting ﬁ'om the ﬁeld. He shot
three of four from beyond the arc.
The redshirt junior injured his arm
in the ﬁrst half, but returned in the
second half. He received anX-ray af-
ter fouling out at the 1:44 mark, but
results have not come back yet.

Pitt will be back in action next
Tuesday against La Salle.

“I had anticipated us beinga much
better team, but obviously we’re not
where I want us to be at this time,”
Dixon said. “We always get better as
the year goes on, and we’ll have to
do that again.” i

FOOTBALL

Pitt’s defense the final

-‘-3 Chris Fanelli
. Stajf Writer

Coming into the season, most Pan-

ther fans were excited to see what the

{ootball team’s offense was going to
ring to the table.

Now, as the season enters its last
two weeks, the focus has shifted to the
other side of the ball, where the Pan-
thers will rely on an ever—improving
defense to carry them to two more

'~?victories and a bowl-game berth.

Star tailback Ray Graham and
multiple starting offensive linemen
including guard Lucas Nix have suf-
fered injuries, and the offense con-
tinues to play at an inconsistent level.

,._(_Jurrently, the Pittsburgh defense is
ranked ﬁfth in the Big East, allowing
355.6 yards per game, but the coaches
and players feel they are headed in the
right direction.

Unexpectedly, leadership of this
defense has fallen to sophomore
defensive lineman Aaron Donald
— who is currently. tied for sixth in
the nation in sacks with nine on the
season. Donald showed rapid devel-
opment from last year, when he got
spotty playing time as a freshman.

“Technique—wise, he was very,
very raw when we got here because
he hadn’t played much,” head coach
Todd Graham said. “What makes him
special is his explosive power. The sky
is the limit for how good he can be.”

Donald isn’t the only one having
success on the defensive line, as senior
standouts Chas Alecxih and Myles
Caragein continue to be stout and de-
pendable. Alecxih has 45 tackles and
4.5 sacks on the season, and Caragein
has contributed 32 tackles from his
position as defensive tackle.

“The other guy who’s really im-
proved his game is Myles Caragein,”

hope to salvage Iacklusterseason

Graham said. “He’s really improved
his pass-rushing and has played a lot
more snaps on third down.”

The versatility of the line has en-
abled the Panthers to take a different
approach as the season progressed.
At its outset, Pitt was expecting to
bring a lot of blitz packages to really
put pressure on the opposing team’s
quarterback, but it became evident
that more help was needed in the
secondary. But Pitt has been able to
rush only three or four players and
still get pressure.

For defensive line coach Paul
Randolph, that gives the Panthers a
chance to be more versatile.

“Ourback end ﬁts ourfront, which
allows us to rush three and drop eight,
or we can rush four and drop seven,”
Randolph said. “V\f1th that, you have
to have tremendous coverage when
you’re dropping eight. I call them cov-
erage sacks, and I remind my guys to

make sure you thank the defensive
backs for doing a great job.”

As a result, the secondary has
stepped up recently. Over the past
ﬁve games, the Panthers have im-
proved considerably and have only
given up an average of 176.4 yards
a game through the air. Before that,
the Panthers gave up more than 200
yards passing in each of their con-
tests, including a 399—yard, three-
touchdown performance by Iowa’s

Jake Vandenberg.

The secondary will certainly have
to be on its game for the Backyard
Brawl. WestVirginia has the Big East’s
top passing offense, averaging over
362.1 yards per game. To slow down
the attack, the linemen will need to get
pressure on standout junior quarter-
back Geno Smith and the secondary
will have to be alert for the screen pass
of which West Virginia head coach
Dana Holgorsen is so fond.

“They do a great job with their
screen package,” Randolph said. “For
our guys, it’s tough to attack and im-
pact the quarterback when they slip
the screen out on you. It’s a way of
slowingldown the rush and control-
ling the rush, and West Virginia just
does a great job with running the
screen.”

The players know the screen is a
threat as well, and they’re using the
bye week to get extrapreparation for
the Mountaineers and their explosive
athletes.

“You just got to be more cautious
and always watch out for it,” Donald
said. _

With the offense still trying to ﬁnd .

its identity post-Ray- Graham-injury,
the players of the Panthers defense
will be the key to Pitt’s chances at
salvaging the season. In fact, the op-
portunity of a bowl game could rest
in their hands. ﬁ

VOLLEYBALL

Eighth—seeded Panthers conﬁdent going into tournament

Torie Wytiaz 5

Staff Writer

In theory, the eighth-seeded Pitt volleyball
team would have a tough time facing the No. 1
seed in the Big East tournament. But the odds
might be in Pitt’s favor, as the Panthers are the
only team in" the conference to have taken down
the Louisville Cardinals. ’ .
Securing the eighth seed wasn’t easy for the
Panthers, who had to end the season with a
four—match win streak to secure atoumament
berth. The ﬁght doesn’t stop there, though.
Louisville will present a whole new set of chal-
lenges. .

’ The Pitt team earned a 3-1 victory at Lou-
isville on Oct. 23, and as a result the Panther
players feel conﬁdent going into the end-of-
season tournament.

“It was an awesome feeling to beat a- team
like Louisville, especially on their court,” senior
middle ‘blocker Kiesha Leggs said. “A win like

       
 

y Lola Aeiislanbékova, who has L

that lets :V0_u'r team know that we are capable

of beating any team, and it really boosts our
conﬁdence going forwar .”

Fellow senior middle hitter Lauren Hart-
man agreed, but noted that Louisville will be
looking for revenge.

“We were Louisville’s only conference loss
this year, and I am sure they will be ﬁred up to
play us again,” Hartman said. “We know that,
as a team, we have to be just as focused and
ready to play.”

That focus has been evident in the ﬁnal
matches of the Panthers’ season, as they con-
cluded their schedule with a 3-1 victory over
USE to cap the four—match win streak and se-
cure a tournament berth.

Coming into the USF contest, Pitt controlled

its own destiny in terms of securing a spot in _

the end-,of-season conference tournament. A

.egvictofry gbver USF would give them the eighth
and ﬁnal seed.

-“The whole teamihad a must-win mental-
ity inpreparing for the USF match,” Pitt head
coach Toby Rens said. “Everyone understood

.. that a win put us in the tournament and a loss

would end our season.” ’
The Panthers (18-12, 7-7 Big East) respond-
ed to the challenge and defeated the USF Bull-
dogs (11-16', 7-7) in four sets with scores of

26-24, 23-25, 25-23 and 25-19.

‘offensively, Leggs led all players with 17 to-

tal kills while also contributing four blocks for.

points. She currently ranks third in the Big East
in kills, points and hitting percentage. For the
entire season, she has led her team in kills and
blocks. Additionally, she is on pace to become

the ﬁfth player in Panther history to earn 400 ~

kills and 100 blocks in one season.

“Kiesha has been a major asset to our of-
fensive game plan this whole season,” Rens
said of his senior captain. “We will look for
her leadership and aggressivestyle to come
into play again against Louisville.”

, While the offensive sparkwas decisive, the
Pitt defense and serving was also critical in
the USF match and will continue to be going
forward. - 1 .

Four Panthers ﬁnished the USF match with
double-digit dig ﬁgures as they held the Bull-
dogs to a .114 hitﬁng percentage, and sopho-
more Monica Wignot led all players with four
serving aces while freshman Lindsey Zitzke

' added three.

“We have Worked on serving nearly every
week in practice,” Rens said. “Executing our
serving can put the other team out of their

1 system and rhythm, and it’s a part of the game

that we can control.” _

The Panthers ﬁnished the regular season
ranked second in the Big East in serving aces,
while Zitzke ﬁnished second in the individual
category. V

As the Panthers prepare to face Louisville,
Rens stressed the importance of consistencyin
his team’s play and acknowledged the necessity
of mental toughness. '

“Louisville is an excellent team with a lot of
experienced players,” Rens said. “We need to
match that by limiting our errors and staying
focused even if we don’t have the lead.”

For the Panther players, the BigEast tourna-
ment is a chance to show that they can compete
with the leagué’s best teams. . ‘

“Earning a spot in the tournament proves

thatwe belongwiththe bestof the conference,” , _

Leggs said. “We have shown that we can also
beat the best.” _

The Panthers’ season was extended with
their win against USF, but they are looking to
continue playing after their Nov. 18 matchup
with the Cardinals in Milwaukee, Wis. If the
Panthers win, they will face No. 4 Syracuse
or No. 5 Notre Dame in the semiﬁnals on Nov.
19.

“As a senior, I was glad our season did not
end with a loss against USF,” Hartman said.
“I certainly do not want it to end with a loss
to Louisville, and I am conﬁdent that we can
prove ourselves once again.” [
