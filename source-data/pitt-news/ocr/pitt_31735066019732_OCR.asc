Socialist conference
addresses capitalism

By Marc Hopkins

Staff Writer

Political activism took center
stage in David Lawrence Hall last
Saturday and Sunday as the
Young Socialist Alliance spon-
sored the Socialist Youth and Ac-
tivists Conference.

The conference featured a
myriad of interest groups
representing issues on the domes-
tic and international‘ agenda.
While the concerns of the differ-
ent groups varied, the central
theme of the conference ex-
pressed a relationshipbetween
the capitalist economic system
and the concerns of each respec-
tive group.

During a press conference at
the Pathfinder Bookstore located
in Garfield, Kathleen Mickells,
the YSA's vice presidental candi-
date explained the Alliance's
platform and goals. ”Yo‘ung peo-
ple are rebelling against the fu-
ture capitalism offers,” she said.

Mickells held the U.S. govern-
ment responsible for the current
economic problems facing the
nation and called for a reduction
of the work week without a cut
in pay. This action, explained
Mickells, would enable more
people to be employed. Mickells
also urged workers to fight
against oppression in the Third
World, end aid to the Contras

and work for the demise of
apartheid.

”The campaign combines the
efforts of workers everywhere,”
said Mickells. ”The enemy is the

Y same — the capitalist class. The

campaign must be taken interna-
tionally to forge links between
workers.”

Focusing on the youth, Mick-

ells stressed the need to be ”po—'

litically armed.”

National conference coordina—
tor Derek Bracey added, ”Young
people do not have jobs, and
their right to [have] jobs needs to
be protected.AThere is no such
thing as permanent employment;
anyone can have their wages
blocked/'~

Supporters of the conference
were united in the beliefthat the
world situation would only im-
prove with the erosion of the
capitalist system.

An excerpt from the conference
registration booklet states: "The
YSA advances the perspective of
revolutionary change in the Unit-
ed States. We need to overthrow
the blood—sucking system of
capitalism here and establish a
workers’ ' and farmers’
government.”

Attendance at the conference
numbered over 500 people,
drawing support from major U.S.
cities and abroad. Conference
supporters traveled from as far as

The University of Pittsburgh
finalized a deal yesterday to
purchase an Oakland bar, The
Sanctuary.

Jim Watters, assistant vice

Finance Office, said, ”By pur—
chasing The Sanctuary, the
university obtained adjoining
property.”

‘ The Sanctuary is the fourth
property the university has
purchased in the last year. Pitt
has bought the Pitt Tavern, on
the corner of Bouquet Street
and Fifth Avenue, Your Cam-
pus Store, located on Fifth
Avenue and Puccini hair sal-
on, on Bouquet Street.

"The Sanctuary is strategi-
cally located near the univer-
sity, and the property can be
held for the planning of a
university building,” said

Watters.

Watters said that the actual
deed transfer would take place
at the end of the week, with
the university actually taking
the building ”probably by the
end of the month.”

Owners of The Sanctuary
approached Pitt officials about
eight months ago about the
possible sale, according to
Watters.

Pitt junior Tim Comptaron
said, ’’I hear they are going to
build dorms with it. If that is
true, it is a good sa|e.”

Pitt student Brian Goldinger
reacted to The Sanctuary’s
closing. ”|t is not big deal. All
it really has is a dance floor.
There are a lot of better bars
in Oakland.”

senior said, I won't miss it be-

A university—sponsored shuttle
service covering the North Oak-
land area has recently been ap-
proved for weekend
transportation to provide better
security for students.

The service was created
through a consensus between the
South Oakland Citizens Council,
Inc. and the University of
Pittsburgh.

Prior to this service, students
had access to shuttles going only
to ”the Hill" and Trees Hall on
Allequippa Street.

Mike Wells, a Pitt sophomore
and brother at Phi Delta Theta
fraternity, initiated the new shut-
tle service. ’’I saw that the shut-
tle was being provided for the
fraternities on the Hill and felt we
were entitled to the same serv-
ice," he said.

Wells said his biggest problem
was finding the right connections
to get the North Oakland shuttle
started.

”Chuck [Farine|la, lFC presi-

Green. ”They [YSA] had a vision
of a world without want based on
needs, not profit — that's what at-
tracted me to them.”

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the

/university's black studies depart-

ment, urged conference support-
ers to continue the fight against
apartheid.

Brutus, evaluating the world sit-
uation, said, ”Clearly, we are en-
tering a period of crisis in terms
of the global economic situation.

lncreasing pressure is coming

a dent] made- the final connec-

tions,” said Wells. ”He talked to
the faculty,.and that's all it took.”

Farinella had presented the

‘idea of a North Oakland shuttle

service at a regular meeting be-
tween student leaders and faculty
members. From that meeting, the
idea was presented to the South
Oakland Citizens Council, Inc.,
an agency that acted as a media-
tor between North Oakland's
fraternities and its community.

Pat Scanlon, executive director
of the South Oakland Citizens
Council, lnc., said ”We hope this
is a solution to the after-party
problem as well as the security
problem.

”We feel it is the right of the
community to _live in peace and
harmony,” said Scanlon, ”We
consider the fraternities part of
the community and think this will
mutually benefit the university,
the students and the com-
munity.”

The shuttle will be funded
through. both Student Housing
and Public Safety and will run Fri-

day and Saturday evenings from
10 p.m. to 2 a.m. for the re-
mainder of the term.

John Vrana, assistant vice presi-
dent of the Office of Business and
Finance, said the cost of the shut-
tle is ”moderate.” He also said,
in reference to continuing the

shuttle service in the fall, that the _

Office of Business and Finance
will ’’look at it and see how well
it is utilized” to determine
whether there is really a need for
it or not.

Wells said that he hopes the
shuttle service will be a solution
to the complaints the fraternities
received due to after-party noise
and trash. »

The route for the shuttle begins

‘on the Bigelow side of the

Cathedral of Learning, proceed-
ing to a stop at Bayard and
Bellefield, turning on North
Dithridge with stops at all three
fraternity houses. it will then go
to Centre, turning on Neville with
a stop at Wallingford and Neville.
The shuttle will then go back to
Bayard and Bigelow, ending in
front of the William Pitt Union.

Garbage poses serious problem for Lothrop residents

0 By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Students living in Lothrop Hall
have turned the patio outside the

dorm into a garbage dump, ac-
cording to students and Falk Clin-
ic employees who work on
Lothrop’s first floor.

”Every spring, we ‘face the,

that has been thrown from Lothrop Hall.

same problem,” said Iva Fedor-
ka, who works at Falk Lab. ”The
students throw garbage out their
windows -— we've got rotting
food and broken glass right out-
side our offices. It's a disgusting
practice and also dangerous.”

According to Pitt's resident stu-
dent Code of Conduct, ”A resi-
dent/guest is absolutely
prohibited from throwing any-
thing from the windows and/or
balconies of any residence
building.” "

The littering sometimes esca-
lates into outright vandalism, the
first floor tenants said.

”[The resident students] some-
times drop garbage bags filled
with water,” said Diane Rum-
baugh, dermatology department
administrator. ”The noise is un-
believable. This whole suite
shakes.”

Rumbaugh’s department, along
with the Falk Lab, Internal Medi-
cine, Emergency Medicine,
Cardiology and Benedum Geri-
atric, occupies an area of Lothrop
Hall formerly known as the
Grand Lounge. The first-floor
lounge area has glass doors and
windows leading out onto the pa-
tio, which is bordered on three
sides by Lothrop Hall.

In addition to paper, garbage
and food, students also throw out
broken furniture, mattresses,
clothing and other assorted rub-
bish, according to Lothrop oc-
c u p a n ts.

”We don't mind when it's
streamers or confetti after Pitt has
won a football game or some-
thing like that,” Rumbaugh said.
”But this is a constant thing. It's
disgusting.” ’

Several students and Falk em-
ployees reported seeing rats in

and around the patio area. No
rats have been seen inside the
building, however.

Rumbaugh said she had to
have a window and an air condi-
tioner in her office replaced after
a load of garbage landed on it.
The weight of the garbage on the
air conditioner cracked the win-
dow in which it was mounted.
The garbage dripped into the air
conditioner’s vents and ruined it,
Rumbaugh said.

A window in medical professor
Donald Leon’s office had to be
replaced after being shot with a
B-B gun, according to Rumbaugh
and Leon's assistant, Randi
Klemm.

One of the major problems
with using the patio as a dump-
ing area surfaces at the end of the
semester, when students alleged-

Shuttle service gets
a valuable expansion

Last week, a new shuttle route was approved for the Pitt cam-
pus. There is already one shuttle service at Pitt, serving the north
section of the university, particularly the fraternity houses and
the athletic buildings.

The new service will carry studentsfrom the front of the
‘Cathedral to various destinations in the North Oakland area.
Now, students living on or near N. Dithridge, Neville and
Center will have an alternative to walking home.

We think that the expansion of the shuttle service is a good
idea, and we hope that the university will consider an addi-
tional expansion to serve the vast number of students living
in the South Oakland area.

We feel that the program at Carnegie Mellon is a good one
after which to pattern the Pitt system. There, an evening serv-
ice takes students from the campus center to the'North Oak-
land area but will deviate from the mapped route by a distance
of one mile.

Due to the larger student body at Pitt, a mile may be too large
from a logistical standpoint, but a little leeway in the route is
a good idea. Many thanks to all involved in bringing this phase

of the shuttle program to fruition.

In a nutshell 

If Jesus Christ had known he was going to die for all
of this, he'd have gone to law school instead.

The letter to The Pitt News
(March 30, I988) complaining
about the publication of a picture
showing students in Florida is
another example of shooting the
messenger if you don't like the
message. While the writer, and
undoubtable others, found the
picture ”offensive,” both the pic-
ture and the article was a worthy
news piece.

I know a great amount of in-
terest and comment was generat-
ed since I heard several remarks
from both students and faculty.
This was so because the subject
matter was about topics near and
dear to students and others.

I find the spring—break
phenomenon fascinating for the
sociological and psychological
questions it raises about young
males and females. I was in-
trigued by the comments of a

male Pitt student that removing
the tops was OK, but that he
didn't like it when some females
removed their bottoms. The
writers of the letter could have
told us why they were offended
and perhaps an interesting dia-
logue could start in The Pitt
News.

The Pitt News could have
taken the lead rather than having
more editorials and articles about
national affairs. The Pitt News is
rather boring because it doesn't
have many in—depth articles
directly relevant to campus life.
Why do we need to pay national
correspondents like Ellen Good-
man et al to appear in a campus
paper? Students have told me that
the crossword puzzle is the main

bonng

I attraction of The Pitt News.

The only other story I remem-
ber which was of great interest
was the ”Bozik-blackout” story.
Why no follow—up or investiga-
tive reporting about big-time ath-
letics? What is the attitude
towards students when Dr. Bozik
can say with a straight face that
Pitt is wonderful because 3000
tickets are available to students?
(Remember last fall when they
were not going to take Pitt to
Houston?)

Come on Pitt News! Let's have
more articles which are offensive
and provocative. Shake up the
campus a bit and leave off-
campus news to the traditional
sources.

A call to battle; ”Remember the love letter!”

I am standing in the post office,
behind 14 other Americans who
share my zip code and my astute
consumer judgment. We are the
people who stocked up on books
of 22—cent stamps before the rates
went up to a quarter. We are now
queuing up for our three cents
worth.

This is at least the third or
fourth time I have performed the
same ritual in honor of postal in-
flation. But today, as the line
inches toward the window, I
have time to consider what else
has changed since the WPA ar-
chitect put up this monument to
public postal service. Take, for
example, mail.

Remember when the Commis-
sion for Privatization put the post
office on their hit list? They sug-
gested that mail delivery might be
turned over to private business.
Did Americans rise up and de-
fend the one government service
that touches home and hearth in
rain, sleet and you know what?
There was nary a murmur.

Now, in this three-cent line, I
have finally figured out why the

postal service is no longer a ' '

cherished American institution.
It's not that the post office closes
too early. It's not that it can take
a week to get mail from Boston
to New York. The problem is that
the post office no longer gives
American citizens a product they
like — mail. The last time that
word stirred the soul of the aver-
age American was when he or
shewas in the army, or summer
camp, or in love. Last year, more
than 160 billion’ pieces of mail
were delivered, but few of them
communicated anything more
meaningful than a threat to our
line of credit.

The heart of the postal service,
the reason it warranted a special
place in the Constitution, was
that it kept Americans together
across vast distances. We ex-
changed our lives through letters.
They were the way — the only
way — we stayed in contact with
each other.

The letters that come down to
us from 18th-century diplomats
and 19th-century pioneers are
testimonies to the distance and a

longing and loneliness that are
rare in this mobile and verbal
generation. Last month, a very
modern young friend, watching
The Color Purple on cable tele-
vision, was merely confused by
the image of a woman waiting
hungrily for a letter from her sis-
ter. ”Why,” she asked her
mother, ”didn’t the sister just
call?”

Even in my childhood, long-
distance relatives kept in contact
by mail. My grandparents an-

swered any cross-country phone
call by instinctively asking,
”What’s wrong?” Now we reach
out and touch someone by
Touchtone. The telephone com-
pany sells us ”guilt calls.” We
chat on the phone and use the
mail for sending careful hard
news.

The wonderful, storytelling nar-
rative of letters, the heft and feel
of pen and paper have been
replaced by the ephemeral dia-
logue of the telephone. It's an ex-
change that leaves us with
nothing more than a dial tone.
And in our mail slot, the letter has
been replaced by the telephone
bill.

What does the so—called letter
carrier deliver to my household?
What is the end prduct of this her-
alded passage through rain and
snow? Bills, catalogs, magazines,
advertisements, fund-raising re-
quests. A ton of impersonal mail
for an ounce of personal commu-
nication.

Mail, which was preciously
protected, has become junk.
Even our greeting cards are not

usually written by us but by some
commercial ghostwriter.‘ We
merely sign them and send them.
On many days, the closest thing
to a personal touch is the robo-
type on a fund-raising letter.

Indeed, it has become so hard
to get us to even open envelopes
that our business correspondents
print the important message on
the outside. Which of our 19th-
century ancestors would believe
how much mail we simply throw
away?

The stamps I purchase today
will send my best regards to bill
collectors. It is not a thought to
send goose bumps up my arms.
In the American mailbag, as in
much of American life, the per-
sonal has been replaced by the
commercial.

But all this suggests to me a de-
cent rallying cry for an endan-
gered species of public service:
Save the Post Office. Write Some-
one a Letter. (And don't forget the
extra three-cent stamp.)

Victim’s rights the topic of lecture by ex-model

By Lisa Molinaro
Staff Writer

Two years ago, two men
slashed the face of model Marla
Hansen with razor blades and in-
tensified the controversy involv-
ing the victimization of women.
’ Hansen was the principal

‘speaker for the rights of women
, victims at a lecture held last

Thursday in the William Pitt
Union, entitled ”Women: Vic-
tims Power Rights.”

Hansen began by describing
the events of June 5, i986, the
day she awake in a hospital bed
with fr Jr cuts on her face. She'd
been in surgery most of the night
before, coming out with over 150
stitches.

Hansen then detailed the
events leading to the attack.

She'd moved into an apartment

building owned by a man named
Steven Roth. Roth became infatu-
ated with her and often entered
her apartment unannounced with
his key. Hansen eventually

_ moved from the building.

After moving out, she asked for
h-er security deposit to be

returned. After several arguments,
Roth agreed to meet Hansen in a
bar and return the money. After
leaving the bar, Roth and Hansen
were approached by the two men
hired by Roth. The men grabbed
her and slashed her face; later,

Marla Hansen spoke on victims rights‘.

they were apprehended by
police.

’’I didn't realize the attack l’d
face in the courtroom would be
more severe than the attack I
faced an the street,” Hansen said.
In the wake of the attack, the

police began questioning her on
details of the attack, her life and
Steven Roth. ‘I felt as though l
was the one who had done some-
thing wrong,” she said.

As she was questioned about
her relationship with Roth, Han-
sen said she felt like she had been
an ”accomplice” in her own at-
tack. ’’It’s a common thing to
blame the victim for her own at-
tack,” she said.

Hansen was cross—examined by
Bowman's attorney, Alton Mad-R

her of wearing provocative cloth-

prostitution.-

Hansen believes one of the
main reasons for the mistreatment
of women victims by society is
fear. She said that people would
rather believe she provoked the
attack, so they can think it can’t
happen to them.

”We have to quit blaming the

human beings.”

Sallier still undecided; Pitt near top of list

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

Contrary to a March 23 article
in the Beaver County Times, Bri-
an Sallier, a 6-foot—8 for-
ward/ceriter from Lincoln High
School in Port Arthur, Texas, said
he has not verbally committed to

Pitt, and is still narrowing his

choice of schools.

”No, I didn't verbally commit,”
Sallier said, ’’But I'm real high,
real highon [Pitt .”

Sallier is also being recruited as
a tight end by the University of
Oklahoma. "I'm thinking about
Oklahoma,” he said.

But not for football. ’’I’m going
for basketball,” Sallier said.

With letter of intent day (April

13) quickly approaching, Sallier‘

said he would commit ”some-
where around Monday.”

Sallier averaged 19.5 points per
game his senior year and would
be a major asset to Pitt consider-
ing the loss of Charles Smith and

Marshall lork/The Pitt News

Oklahoma's Stacey King scored 17 points in last night's loss.

Fouts’ retirement signals

Surely, but sadly, the names of
the star quarterbacks of the 19705
have dropped from the lineups of
National Football League teams
and passed into memory.

Miracle workers known as
Staubach, Stabler, Anderson,
Bradshaw, Griese, Tarkenton and
Jones have been replaced in this
decade's youth movement by
present stars, like Marino, Kelly,
Elway and Kosar. A new genera-
tion of heroes own the game. The
men of the 19705’ contributions
are now property of, occasional-
ly, the Hall of Fame, and even
more so, NFL Films.

Add another name to the roster
of the past: Daniel Fouts, former
fighter pilot for the San Diego

Chargers.

On March 24, Fouts decided to
put an end to his brilliant NFL
career, claiming that injuries had
finally taken their toll on his
36-year-old body. ”l just didn't
feel physically up to it anymore,”
he admitted to the press after the
decision was final. ”|t’s some-
thing l’ve been thinking about.”

Taking a hit in the pocket was
something Fouts never seemed
concerned with when dropping
back to pass. ”When he's
blitzed,” former Steeler lineback-
er Jack Lambert once said, ”He
hangs in there. He takes his beat-
ing, and he doesn't flinch. He's
an old—fashioned quarterback,
like Bobby Layne.”

 

Demetreus Gore to graduation
and the possible early departure
of Jerome Lane to the NBA.
And despite a sub—par senior
season, Sallier is also considered
the top prospect to step in and fill
graduating tight end Keith Jack-
son’s spot on the Sooner squad.

”Brian was hurt in the first 1

game his senior year,” said coach
Williams, Sa|lier’s football coach,
”and he was much more produc-
tive his junior year.

Williams said Sallier caught 30

passes and averaged five solo
tackles and two assists on
defense. He also had two pass in-
terceptions.

Sallier was hindered with a
thigh injury at the outset of his
senior season. ”He caught 10 to
12 passes his senior year and
barely played any defense,” Wil-
liams said.

Manning's all-around play gives

By Jim O'Connell
AP Basketball Writer

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Danny
Manning scored 31 points and
grabbed 18 rebounds as un-
ranked Kansas won its second na-
tional championship with an
83-79 victory over No. 4 Oklaho-

ma Monday night to become the A

losingest champion in NCAA
history. -

The Jayhawks, 26-11, played
fast and slow and withstood a
record-setting 3-point perfor-
mance from Oklahoma's Dave
Sieger to avenge two losses to the
Sooners, 35-4, during the regular
season.

This was the third champion-
ship game played between two
teams from the same conference
and it was the third this decade
in which a heavy underdog
managed to win the title.

Kansas was an eight-point un-
derdog but in the first half the Jay-
hawks ran with the Sooners, the
nation's second-leading scoring
team and the regular-season and
tournament champions in the Big
Eight. Then they showed patience
in the second half, running down
the 45-second clock before tak-
ing good percentage shots. The
Jayhawks shot 64 percent for the
game, 35 of 55; and they cooled
off after a first half in which they
made 17 of 20 at one point.

But for all the strategy of Coach ..

Larry Brown it was Manning, the
two-time All-America who car-
ried the Jayhawks to the title in
a year in which they overcame
injuries and academic problems.

THOMAS
DANYLIIK

And as a result, his whole
career was plagued with injuries.
Yet he kept coming back. The big
question NFL teams asked in fear
was not whether Fouts would
ever be dressed in uniform again,
but how soon, and would he be
ready in time to wreak his havoc
on them.

Who remains active from the
lore of the 19705? Thirty-eight-
year-old Joe Ferguson, for years
the other heart and soul of the
Buffalo Bills (beside O.J. Simp-
son), and presently a relief pitch-

Milt Newton added 15 points
for Kansas, while Kevin Pritchard
had 13. Sieger led Oklahoma
with 22 points, while Stacey King
had 17 and Harvey Grant and
Mookie Blaylock 14 each. But
King and Grant, the two leading
scorers, had just four each in the
second half.

Kansas took the lead for good
at 69-68 on a hook shot by Man-
ning with 8:50 left in the game.
It was the last of seven straight
Kansas points scored by the
6-foot—1O center and the play

' started with Manning standing at

midcourt with the ball waiting for
Oklahoma to come out and ap-
ply pressure._
Manning handed the ball off,
cut to the basket and hit the hook.
Chris Piper then hita jumper to
give Kansas a four-point lead. The

Sooners tied the score on a free A

throw by Sieger and a turnaround
jumper by Grant with 5:55 left.

Pritchard hit a baseline drive
with 5:34 left and the Jayhawks
were on the way to the first na-

tional championship for a team ’

from west of the Mississippi River
since UCLA won in 1975.

Manning sealed the victory
with four free throws in thefinal
14 seconds. He gave Kansas an
81-77 lead with the ‘first two.
Scooter Barry had missed the se-
cond free throw of a 1-and-1 but
Manning tapped the rebound and
was fouled by King.‘

Sieger made seven 3-pointers,
six in the first half, to tie the
championship game team and in-
dividual record set last season by
Indiana's Steve Alford.

er looking to win aspot with the
Indianapolis Colts. Jim Plunkett of
the Raiders is also hanging on for
dear life, although most of his
magic was worked in this decade.
Steve Grogan of New England
makes a few splashes once in a
while when Tony Eason is on the
bench.

After that, welcome to the
19905.

It is strange that Fouts’ retire-
ment was taken by the sporting
world so casually. NBC broad-
caster and former Cincinnati Ben-
gal Bob Trumpy called him ”the
best timing passer ever. He could
stand in the freeway and throw
balls through the windows of
moving cars.” Granted, Fouts

Iayha wks upset win over Sooners

Manning picked up his third
foul just 25 seconds into the se-
cond half but he never got his
fourth.

Sieger made his seventh
3-pointer of the game on his 10th
shot from that range but then he
went cold.

Sieger missed two in a row on

one possession and seemed
ready to take a third when the
ball bounced back to him. But he
hesitated and passed the ball in-
side to King who scored fora
65-60 lead, Oklahoma's largest of
the game.

Brown called a timeout just be— ‘
fore King's basket. The Jayhawks T
scored five straight points to tie ’

the game, the last three coming
on’ a three—point
Manning.

Sieger was the hot hand for Ok-
lahoma as he made six of eight
3-point attempts while the Soon-

ers made 48.7 percent as a team, 5

19 of 39.

The first half was played at Ok-

lahoma's ‘tempo as the teams
finished tied at 50-50.

Sieger, who finished 7-of—1 3 in
3-pointers, answered with his
third 3-pointer and King added a
baseline drive and the Sooners
were within one again.

Manning picked up his second
foul with 10:44 remaining in the
half and with the two-time All-
America on the bench, the Soon-
ers couldn’t capitalize as they
outscored Kansas 12-10 with
Manning out of the game.

Oklahoma had beaten Kansas
twice during the season, 73-65
and 95-87.

QB era  

never was the quarterback of a
Super Bowl participant, let alone
champion. The closest he and his
Charger teammates ever came to
the pinnacle was during the years
1980 and 1981, when San Die-
go advanced to consecutive AFC
Championship games.

The Raiders, then the Bengals,
took turns bouncing Air Coryell,
named after San Diego head
coach and offensive genius Don
Coryell, from the playoffs. No
defense, that's what the coroners
agreed to be the cause of death.

Through it all, one thing was
for certain —— lack of offense was
never a suspect.

Panther tennis squad disposes of

Tartans in grand fashion, win 8-1 

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's varsity tennis
team entered yesterday's match
against Carnegie Mellon with two
goals in mind — one team and
one personal — and accom-
plished both at the expense of the
outmanned Tartans.

The Panthers, 8-7, fulfilled a
team goal by defeating CMU 8-1
and raising their record above the
.500 mark.

In singles action, the Panthers’
Neil Meyerowich won a tough
7-5, 7-6 decision over Keith Gru-
met; Jeff Mills defeated Graham
McAfee 6-2, 6-3; Greg Campbell
pummelled Rob Schlackman 6-0,
6-1; Vivek Kumar won a three-set
decision over Thinh Le 6-1, 3-6,
7-5.

Though Campbell is too team-

Dieffenbach saw to it that credit
was given where credit was due.

”Greg has been a team leader

Lemieux provides magic, but Pens still out

' By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

Just when NHL fans thought
they had seen it all this season,
Mario Lemieux would do some-
thing else that was out of sight.

If it wasn't his incomparable
three-goal, three—assist perfor-
mance in the NHL All-Star game
at St. Louis, it was the goal he

gscored on his knees against Que-

bec —— or his overtime game-
winner while nearly flat on his
back against Washington last
Saturday;

He had a league-high 10 short-
handed goals, and even scored

once with one hand held behind
his back by a Toronto defense-
man. He was Lemieux Le Magni-
fique —— Lemieux the
Magnificent.

”He was so good it was scary,”
Philadelphia coach Mike Keenan
said.

’’If he doesn't get the MVP,
there should be an investigation,”
teammate Dan Quinn said.

But while he became only the
fourth player in NHL history to
score 70 goals in a season, Le-
miuex didn't reach the one goal
he'd set for the 1987-88 season:
leading the Pittsburgh Penguins
into the playoffs for the first time

, since 1982.

”We still are a couple of play-
ers away, but we will be better
next year,” Lemieux said after the
Penguins beat the Hartford Whal-
ers 4-2 Sunday night. ”We had
some guys who wanted to make
the playoffs.”

Lemieux had 70 goals and 98
assists for 168 points in 77
games, 19 more points than
Gretzky. Gretzky played in only
63 games because of a knee in-
jury and failed to win the scoring
title for the first time since enter-
ing the league in 1979.

But, as Montreal defenseman
Larry Robinson said, ”You always

think you've seen the best, and
then somebody else comes
along. Not that Mario's any bet-
ter than Wayne, but it's nice to
have a breath of new life in the
league.” V

After leading Team Canada to
the Canada Cup championship
over the Soviet Union with 11
goals, including four game-
winners, Lemieux enjoyed the
fifth most—productive season in
NHL history.

”The trophy is supposed to go
to the player who is the most
valuable to his team, and I can't
be the judge,” Lemieux said.
’’But I think I did pretty good. I

Art a11d reason

VV hen Mark and I decided to spend
the weekend at his mother’s house,
I never imagined I would be walking
into a mouse’s» nightmare. There were

cats everywhere.

Cat plaques, cat statues, cat clocks,
even a cat mat. I couldn’t begin to dupli-
cate her collection ofkittv litter if‘I spent
a year at a garage sale. Conspicuouslv
absent, however, was a real cat. Strange,
I thought, and began to fear that a
weekend with cat woman could be a
' lot less than purr-feet.’

I But then she came home, and
Mark introduced her. She was
dressed surprisingly wel l-—--no
leopard. pants. In fact, you
could say she was the cat’s meow,
but I’d rather not.

She offered me a cup of Dutch Choc-
olate Mint. Now that was something
I could relate to. Then she brought it
out in the most beautiful, distinctly
unfeline china I’d ever seen. As we
sipped, I found out that Mrs. Campbell
has my same weakness for chocolate,
loves the theater as much as I do, but,
incredibly, never saw “Cats.” So Mark

and I are taking her next month.

have a shot at it.”

”A lot of guys deserve con-
sideration, but there's always one
player that rises above them all,‘
and I think Mario did,” Coffey
said.

And he's only 22 years old.

’’I think I had a great season. I
think I did the best I could,”
Lemieux said. ’’I tried to be a
leader on and off the ice, to help
us win the big games and get the

big goals.”
But he acknowledged that the

pressure of being counted upon
to supply so much of the Pen-
guins’ offense was considerable.
”My goal is to score 200 points,”
he said. .

He could do it, say several
NHL coaches and players.

”You probably could put a tent
around him, and he'd still find a
way to score,” Oilers coach Glen
Sather said. _ ,

’’lt’s my job,” Lemieux said.
”That’s why they pay me a lot 0
money.” , _ -

Heyward  

accepted

NEW YORK (AP) ~— All-
American running back Craig
”lronhead” Heyward of Pitts-
burgh and former Brigham Young
tight end Trevor Molini were
granted eligibility for the NFL
draft this month, the league said
Monday;

Heyward was the nation's

second—leading rusher with 1,655.-

yards last season for the Panthers.

Pitt football coach Mike Gott-
fried sent telegrams to Cincinna-
ti Bengals owner Paul Brown,
Dallas Cowboys president Tex
Schramm and San Francisco
coach Bill Walsh, all members of
the league's competition commit-
tee, asking their support in up-
holding the NFL rule which
regards when college players can

- turn pro.

Heyward opted to end his col-
lege eligibility when, after the

football season, he contacted an '

agent, a violation of collegiate
rules. Heyward and his agent
then threatened to sue if the play-
er wasn't cleared for eligibility for
the draft, scheduled for April 24
through 25.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 5, I988

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Led by freshman sensation El-
bert Ellis, the Panthers turned in
a strong performance at the
Colonial Relays, held on Saturday
at the College of William and
Mary.

Ellis, in capturing Outstanding

«ii»/Iale Athlete at the meet, won the

110-meter high hurdles in 14.23.
He ran the 400-meter intermedi-
ate hurdles in 51.33, good
enough for the runner-up spot in
the event.

Additionally, Ellis was a force
to be reckoned with in the relays.
He ran the lead leg on the shuttle-
hurdle relay team which finished
second, the final three legs being
run by Norris Coleman (substitut-
ing for a nicked-up Calvin Hol-
mes who earlier had finished

.0 third in the 110-meter high hur-

dles), George Ifill and Eric
Cannon.

Ellis ran the second leg of the
1,600—meter relay team which
finished fourth, being clocked in
a time of 3:10. Rowan Mighty led
off for Pitt, followed by Ellis’
standout time of 46.6 and
finished by Chop Burton and
Dave Price.

Three other Pitt relay teams dis-
tinguished themselves. The
400-meter relay team of Cannon,
lfill, Mighty and Neil Malbickey
was clocked in 41.76, which
earned them fourth place in the
event

The distance medley relay
team of Tom Boggan, Dave
Moore, Tony Brookover and Joe
Daniels finished sixth. A disturb-
ing note for the Panthers was the
injury of Moore, who suffered a
strained achilles tendon and will
probably be out of action for the
next two weeks.

The 3,200-meter relay team of
Maurice Walcott, Mike Thomas,
Chris Naumann and Brookover
came in sixth in a time of 7:45.1.

  Ellis leads track team in Colonials

Pitt's Craig Woshner (14:47.1)
and Keith Dowling (14:52.6)
finished first and fourth, respec-
tively, in open 5,000-meter run
while Price was runner-up in the
open 400—meter run (47.2).

The Panthers’ Zac Shea gave a
strong account of himself. He was
clocked in 4202.1, earning sixth
place in the freshman
1,500-meter run.

Pitt coach John Vasvary was
concerned about the walking
wounded on the team at the con-
clusion of the meet. Despite that,
he was proud of his team.

”The Colonial Relays had 90
schools in the field. Most of the
schools from Virginia on up
through the Northeast participat-
ed, including our IC4A rivals. We
are pretty pleased with the
results, overall. We had to juggle
our relay teams as a result of in-
juries. Dave Moore's looks the
most serious, and we are having
him checked out by [team physi-
cian] Dr. [Freddie] Fu.”

Peppler speaks at volleyball clinic

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Mary Jo Peppler, considered by
many to be the finest American
women’s volleyball player to take
the court, was at Pitt on Saturday.
She was in town for the 1988
Gold Medal Volleyball Coaches
Clinic, held at Trees Hall.

Peppler has been a major force
in women's volleyball for over 20
years. In 1964, she played forthe

U.S. Olympic Women's Team.
Three years later she participated
in the Pan Am Games. Then, in
1970, she played in the World
Championships. In the early '70s
she was the only female coach
and setter in the International
Volleyball Association, a coed
professional league.

For the last two years, Peppler
has been player coach of the
New York Liberties in the Wom-
en's Major Professional League.

She noted the difficulty in serving
in a dual capacity —— as a player
and as a coach.

”When the team is playing
well, the dual role is not difficult.
However,,when things are going
bad, it is hard for me to concen-
trate on my individual role be-
cause I am concerned about what
the team is doing,” said Peppler.

In a sport where most people —

are on the downside of their ath-

Cioffi went three—for-five, with

was also three—for-five and had

two hits.

”We played well; we just

Fouts

Continued from page 9
perhaps the greatest offense in the
history of football, at any level.
From 1978 to 1982, Air Coryell
was capable of scoring plenty of
points on any defense in the Na-
tional Football League. Excep-
tional offensive co-stars like
Kellen Winslow, Charlie Joiner,
John Jefferson, Wes Chandler and
Chuck Muncie gave Fouts all the
gunpowder he needed. Then,
come gametime, the stiff-kneed,
bearded quarterback would sim-
ply drop back into the pocket,
cock his right arm and light the
match.

”l fear Dan Fouts more than I
fear Joiner or Chandler because
of Dan Fouts’ gall, forcing the ball
in there and allowing his
receivers to make great catches,”
Los Angeles Raider cornerback
Mike Haynes once said of the
passer.

’Who can ever forget the 1981

playoff between the Chargers and
the Miami Dolphins? ”A Game
No One Should Have Lost,”
Sports Illustrated proclaimed it.
”The greatest game ever played,”
sportswriters all over America
pounded onto their typewriters
for Sunday's sports page.
January 2, Trailing 24-0 after
one quarter of play, Miami quar-
terback Don Strock and the Dol-
phins roared back to tie the
Chargers early in the second half,
then eventually take a 38-31 lead.

‘Momentum had clearly shifted,

but Fouts, and his sidekick Wins-
low, kept firing away at the
porous Miami defense. And after
two overtimes, it was finally over.
41-38, San Diego.

Perhaps it is unfair to single out
Miami’s defensive lackings that

V year, for it was indeed San Die-

go's flimsy defense that continu-
ally kept Fouts and his blitzkrieg
out of the Super Bowl year after

The Chargers could, and
would, score lots of points with
ease. But opponents, well, they
usually would do the same with
equal effort, and in many cases,
with less talent.

Fouts was a third—round selec-
tion by San Diego in 1973 out of
the University of Oregon. His first
five years with the club were
nothing spectacular, and the low-
ly Chargers continued to struggle,
finishing last in the AFC West
four times between 1973-77.

Constantly battling with Charg-
er backup and hometown
favorite Jesse Freitas, as well as
the unkind press, along the way,
Fouts was only 22—47—1 going
into the 1978 season.

That year, it all came together.
Coryell, previously with the St.
Louis Cardinals, was hired to
coach the club. His high-
powered passing attack suited

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 5, T988

Fouts perfectly, and the Chargers
quickly became a force in the
league. From 1979 to 1981, the
team won three straight division-
al titles.

But Air Coryell was suddenly
grounded after the strike-
shortened 1982 season. Coryell
was recently fired, and he insists
he is permanently retired from
coaching. Joiner has quit the
game. So have Jefferson and
Muncie. Winslow is still hanging
on in San Diego, but his playing
days have been cut shorter by
numerous injuries. Playoff ap-
pearances were many, but the
Chargers are still without Super
Bowl rings.

Now, 43,040 yards, 254 touch-
downs and six Pro Bowls later,
Captain Fouts is handing in his
wings. Suddenly, as far as NFL
defenses are concerned, the air-
ways have become a lot safer.

letic careers by the age of 30, her’

ability to excel at the age of 41
is nothing short of remarkable.

Peppler believes her desire to
excel has led to an elongated
career. ”l am very goal-oriented.
if there is an opportunity to ac-
complish something, I'll go after
it I get very obsessed over some-
thing and then I channel all my
energy in that direction," ob-
served Peppler.

When volleyball season is oveﬂiw

she gets away from conditioning
herself to play, prefering to do
something creative. ”At the end
of the season, I prefer to do some-
thing totally different, like writ-
ing. l have always had a wide
variety of interests,” Peppler
noted. ’
Peppler has helped the Univer-
sity of Florida women's team for
the last few years but will be un-
able to do so in thefuture. In-
dividuals who were involved

with Women’s Major Leagues‘?

Volleyball last season (such as
Peppler and Pitt coach Shelton
Collier) were permitted to return
to college coaching this past fall;
however, the NCAA, in its infinite
wisdom, has ruled that in the fu-
ture no college coach can have
ties to the professional league.

Although the NCAA ruling was
disappointing to Peppler, she
need only think how far she has
seen the game she loves grow in
the last 20 years. At one time, she
was best known as the inaugural
winner of the Women's Super-
stars competition; now, she is
known as the top female practi-
tioner of her sport America has
ever known. 1
