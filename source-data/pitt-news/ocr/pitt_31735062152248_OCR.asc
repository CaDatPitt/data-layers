serving on committees in the vari-
ous organizations on the campus.

“In previous years, freshmen
have been permitted to enter the

experienced upperclasswomen and
causing them to lose interest,” de-g
olares Miss Ericson. “This method,

Peters Rate Quantity Award

With Three Freshman Sons
Starting 0!? At Once

It may be an expense for
psrents to start one ﬂedgling to
college, but it’s just three times
as bad to start three. Ellen-
rossn, Paul and Kenneth Pe-
ters of Perrysville highway all
came to Pitt as freshmen in
Septem, . Ellenrosan and Paul
are in t e college, while Ken-
neth is in the School of Engin-
eering and Mines. Incidentally
each one bought his own
stock of books——oh, just a mat-
ter of eighteen or so altogether.
If we had known all this before
we’d have bought stock in the
book store.

Not that this situation is
without its advantages. Some-
one of the three always has
theme paper handy, no doubt,
and then there’s always some-
bod with whom to send home
boo s. But then, again it’s
harder to compete with two
than one, and certainly harder
to ﬁnd excuses in the case of
two sets of high marks.

Dr. ‘Alderman
Seriously Ill

I»

Dean. of Education School

In ‘Critical Condition

 

Dr. Grover H. Alderman, dean of
the school of education, is in a crit-
ical condition at the Allegheny
General Hospital, according toad-
vices of physicians. He has been
ill for the past several months, but
has been in a serious condition for
only the past two weeks, physicians
said.

Dr. Alderman came to the Uni-
versity in 1925 as dean of the school
of education after a long record as
an educator in the middle west. He
was formerly professor of education
at the University of Indiana and
superintendent of schools in Walker,
Lake Park and Newton, Iowa.

Since comingto Pitt, Dr. Alder-
man has been instrumental in’ estab-
lishing the departments of religious
education, commercial education,

physical education: and higher - edu-

cation. .

Dr. Alderman was granted," a‘
leave of absence from his duties at
the ‘University shortly after the
close of school last spring.

Freshman Why Club
To Hold Doll Party

Sixty active freshman women of
Y. W. C. A. Why Club are making
palns for their annual doll-dressing
Party in Heinz House next Thurs-
day, Dec, 4, following a 5:30 din-
ner meeting. They intend to com-
plete their present tentative plans
for a Mother-Daughter Tea.

The_ Freshman Why Club this
year is functioning on an entirely
different plan than those of former
years. Due to the deterred organi-
zation rules of W. S. G. A., the
sixty active women in the club have
no officers,’ but work 0 one of the
four committees: social, social serv-
ice, program and publicity.

Aleeth Roberts, Col. ’32, Y. W. C.
A. Why Club chairman, states that
“This year’s group seems to be
working together even better than
last year’s, although they have no
formal organization. Possibly the
sharing of the responsibility of the
entire. group is the cause of the
good response the club has had.”

More than 1,100 parents of the
September freshmen were the
guests of Chancellor John G. Bow-
man at the semi-annual parents’ re-
ception, held last Friday evening in
the auditorium and banquet hall of
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial
Hall.

Dean of Men Robert C. Clothier
opened the reception with the intro-
duction of Chancellor Bowman, who
spoke on the attitude that should
be taken by students and parents.
In his speech, Chancellor Bowman
explained the purpose -of the recep-
tion as being “to have the parents
meet the faculty, in order to enlist
their counsel in guiding and encour-
aging the students most under-
standingly in their Work.”

“Children of today,” continued
the Chancellor, “are better balanced,
are more conservative than those of
our youth, and they will think he-

the reception was a result, pri-
marily, of the cordial and effi-
cient way in which they co-
operated.

the creative ability of his child and
not attempt to force him to take up
a profession for which he does not
care. The child will eventually ﬁnd
the thing he Wants to do and will
be perfectly happy and satisﬁed.
Children of today are not to be
scolded when they make bad grades,
but rather should be given the

Announcement of the results of
the state-wide sophomore examina-
tions taken by sophomores in all
Pennsylvania colleges last May re-
veal that two Pitt students have
taken ﬁrst places in their respective
test. John F. Schmitt, Col. ’32, took
ﬁrst place in the general govern-
ment college test, and John  Snioy-
er, Col. ’32, was given first place in
the American History t.

The examination was a follow-up
study of the 1928 freshman class‘
with the purpose of getting a com-
prehensive view of the student’s in-
tellectual achievement after two
years of college work. All sopho-
mores enrolled in their fourth se-
mester in the college, schools of en-
gineering and mines, school of busi-
ness administration, and schools of
education took the examination. At
the Universit more than 700 stu-
dents took t e examination, while
throughout Penn ylvania, sopho-
mores of forty col eges participated
in them.

John Smoyer is majoring in ‘jour-
nalism, ‘is Ia member of the Weekly
staff and a member of the track
team. John F. Schmitt is a pre-
student. The University

Drama Class
  To Give Plays

Group To Present First Of
One-Act Series Tonight

 

Three one-act plays will be pre-
sented this evening at the Frick
Training School Auditorium by the
dramatic students of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The curtain is
scheduled to rise at 8:15. The plays
to be presented tonight are the ﬁrst
of 8. series of one-act plays which
will be given by the Play Produc-
tion Class. They are “The Eldest,”
by Edna Ferber; “The First Dress
Suit,” by Russell Medcraft, and “De-
fea ,” by John Galsworthy. There
will be no admission charged. *

Carl H. Cass, director of the Pitt
Players, has instituted the presen-
tation of these one-act plays to give
his students practical experience in
directing plays and to discover from
among the many applicants those
with the most talent.

He has no part in their presen-
tation or direction, acting only as
the critic of the performances. He
is using this means of starting his
campaign to make the dramatic or-
ganization of the University on a
par with the dramatic organizations
of other universities.

Mr. Cass is working to make the
Pitt Players a really active and
worthwhile campus activity. He
said: “We are a new organization
this year. We have deﬁnitely started
on an attempt to develop. Any
laxness due to no direction, no su-
pervision, is past.”

One of the difficulties the Play-
ers have run up against is the lack
of an inexpensive suitable auditori-
um. The reall good auditoriums
in the neighbor ood are so expensive

One morning they arose as usual

way, they couldn’t persuade him to
get up or get dressed. So ﬁnally
giving up the host, they picked him
out of bed an set him outside the
hotel room and locked the door so
he couldn’t get back in. Poor child
—--he wasn't clothed for winter, by
any exaggeration. “The jokesters
went on their merry way and
promptly forgot that such a sleepy
man ever existed. But-—upon
returning they found him sitting on
the steps between the twelfth and

Argentine Ca-It-l-I-iedral Space.

Named After Famed Men"

The Institution of National Edu-
cation in Argentina, stimulated by
the plans for the Cathedral of
Learning in which the classrooms
will represent the cultural herita
of the various students, has d i-
cated each one of its classrooms to
a distinguished ﬁgure in the ﬁeld of
culture, either Argentinian or Amer-
ican. The name of the person to
whom the room is dedicated will ap-
pear on a special plate which will
be placed in the room.

The idea was introduced by Ar»
gentinian educators who visited
Pittsburgh last summer and in-
spected the Cathedral. They were
greatly impressed with the fact that
each of the ﬁfteen classrooms on
the Commons Room ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral is_ to represent a different
country and will be furnished in the
style of that country.’ On return-
ing to Argentina, they made known
the idea to the Institution of Na-
tional Education who decided to ded-
icate each 'of its rooms to people
distinguished in the ﬁeld of culture.
Since the Institution exists for the
development of cultural relations be-
tween the United States and ‘Ar-
gentina, both the citizens of the
United States and Argentina are
represented.

The names of the people so hon-
ored are: Domingo F. Sarmiento,
Juan B. Alberdi, Sara de Ecleffton,
Horace Mann and Walt Whitman.
Sarmiento and Alberdi are great
figures in the Argentine nation who
were warm champio of the cul-
ture of the United 8 ates, of which
they applied certain aspects durin
their, public lives. Sara de Eel -
ton was at disti 'shed American

Engineering - Association To
Hold Dance, Smoker A

~—-——

 

After an illness of ﬁve weeks, M.
E. Br-inker, graduate instructor. in
the school of engineering and fac-
ulty adviser of the engineering as-
sociation, has returned to school. The
group, newly organized at‘ the be-
ginning of C the semester, has been
held back considerably by Brinker’s
absence ‘but, with his return, is pre-
pared to do all it originally set
out to do. A

The association was formed with
the intent of providing a central or-

ganization through which social ac-
tivities could be successfully han-

is required for membershi . A con-
stitution and a set of by- aws were
drawn u when the association was
formed uring the third week of this
semester. Since then they and a
short foreword written by Dean E.
A. Holbrook have been made up into
a small booklet which has been dis-
tributed to all the students in en-
gineering.  .

Immediately after the organiza-
tion was formed a membership cam-
paign was held in the different en-
gineering departments. So far in
the race the chemical enginers are
ahead. But, during. the last week
new members have been added so
fast that they may lose their posi-
tio.n in the l . ’

Last Friday during the activities
period the ca inet, composed of two
members from each department, met
and planned the social calendar for
the ensuing semester. A smoker to
be held on December 7, and a dance
sometime in January are the social
events.

smoker will be the presentation of a
silver medal to the sophomore stu-
dent who made the highest scholas-
tic average in his studies last year.
The medal is being given by Sigma
Tau, honorary engineering frater-
nity. The committee appointed to
take‘ charge of the smoker consists
of chairman, R. H. Kernahan, E.E.
’31; Fred Reiser, Jr., M. E. ’31, and
H. B. Carter, C. E. '32.

The officers of this association
are: President, E. J. Woll, I.E. '31;

The entire Pitt theater has been
turned over to the members of Mor-
tar lsoard and Owens on December
11 for the Pitt night theater party.
These two organizations jointly will
conduct the party as a beneﬁt affair.
Hereofore, the only theater party
given by any University organiza-
tion-has been the Student Loan Pitt
night. This year, Mortar Board and
Cwens beneﬁt will take the place of
the old Pitt night.

“Jerry” is the play offered that
week, portrayed by Billie Burke.
Candy will be sold in the aisles be-
tween the acts by students. A lar e
crowd is expected this year, and ed
proceeds will be divided between
Cwens and Mortar Board.

Neither Cwens nor Mortar Board
receives money from any Outside
source, and since neither assesses its
members at all, it has been custom-
ary for each to give social affairs in
order to make money. Other years
they have given tea-dances

Fraternities

Striking Pink, Black Cover
Announces New Issue

 

 

The Fraternity Number of the
Pitt Panther made its appearance
on the campus yesterday, in a strik-
ing pink-and-black cover upon which
is illustrated the ﬁrst fraternity in-
itiation in the world. Fraternities
are taken to issue by the Panther
in almost all of its 40-some pages of
cartoons, jokes, short humor and ar-
ticles.

The special feature is an informa-
tive article on “Why Go Frater-
nity?” by Philosopher Bee, noted
pragmatist, duelist and dietist. Des-
pite the fact that Philosopher Bee
would like to know himself, the ar-
ticle should be of invaluable as-
sistance to those who have gone fra-
ternity and to those who wonder
why they did. at

Marvin T. Herrick, in his second
article on the theatre, discusses
plays ranging from “Street Scene”
to “Elizabeth the Queen,” and gives
timely suggestions and hints as to
the shows worth seein . In "Sports
Analysis,” Morris Co en, co-sports
editor of the Weekly, makes his first
appearance in place of Bob Re-
maley, and gives —a review of the
month's sports.

“The Campus Murder Case” is a
hitherto unpublished document by
Doctor Watson about another of the
innumerable exploits of the famous
Baker street detective, Sherlock

“Smart Set-Ups” is the new illus-
trated Panther. ociety page that
gives all the inside dope on ocal so-
ciety folk. On the “Hazard Page”
and on the “Pitt Patter” page there
is to be found the cream 0 the Pan-
ther humor, while “Things About
Town” gives information on the
best places to mug and dance.

The Fraternity Number has been
purposely delayed_in publication in
order to be issued after the rushing
season so as not to disillusion the
freshmen.

Well, folks, we got a little rest
last Saturday, but we are back in
there working our heads off right
now for the annual Thanksgiving
battle ‘with the ferocious Nittany
Lions from Penn State tomorrow.
We didn't go so hot. our game
with Ohio State, sol ﬁgure that we
are set to take the Lions for a ride.
And again I say, since “Jock” pre-
dicted that we lose only two games
thié year, we are almost sure to
win, even. though the Campus
Scout does predict a victory for us.

Anyhow I'm going to tell you a
funny thing that happened’ in 1}-
dressing room on Monday. A couple
of us boys saw one of the fellows
standing over in a corner by him-
self reading a. piece of paper, which
seemed to be holding him spell-
bound. We “snuck” up on him and
grabbed the piece of paper. And
boy did we get 9. laugh when we
read it! I guess I will give you the
low-down, even though it will make
him pretty sore if anybody finds out
who it is. 7

Getting back to the game tomor-

ing a little worrying over losing
our two regular ends, “Jim” Mc-
Murdo and “Rip” Collins, but we
have been using I-Iirshberg and Da-

they look pretty ood to us. “Jock”

receiving one from them free of

a certain dealer down on Forbes

sure would go good with some cran-

think It would be a bad idea for
this dealer to send me one since it's

Panther
Chatter

By BOB LYTLE

vPi*tsb"rsh P-g

Another Thanksgiving has rolled
around and once more Penn State is

going to try to break her biggest I

jinx. Ever since the dim and distant

days of 1919, State teams have been
bucking up against our Panthers
without much success. .
they are a determined ﬁghting

Every year

bunch, and not until the game is
over and the crowds are shuffling
homeward (or elsewhere). _d0 the
Lions of dear old State realize that
they have been beaten again.

This year the Panthers  go
through the same old motions,

 

cross the goal line a few times and

i

then thank the fates that be, that
another season is over, passed and
a thing of history. It might not 
just that simple, but the result will
be the same. Pitt's season hasn't
been a record-maker or anything to
scream about, but the boys have
showed that they are quite‘ capable
of doin things to opposing team
when t e notion moves them.
morrow afternoon the Panthers will
be a. different team from the one
that faced Ohio; they are set for
action and want to end the 17981‘ I5
it should be ended.

Last year State played some
mighty sweet football, but it wasn't
qﬁllte good enough to win. One of
t e Lion linemen told me afterwards
that 1930 would be an altogether
different story and that his crew
would take all of the “thanks” out
of Thanksgiving for Dr. Suther-
land’s men. This  1930 and to-
morrow is Thanks-giving for the In-
habitants of the United States of
America, and I still think ‘that ev-
erything will be serene (in other
words, 0.K.) when the State team
has done its best and the Panthers
have done just a little better. I
don’t know what the exact score will
be, but I do know that Pitt will get.
more points than the boys .who go
to school in Center county.

1919, the last time they defeated
the Panthers. .

The Panthers were favorites that
ear and early in the K8-_m9 they had
orced State deep into its own ter-

ritory. Just _when ever body ex-
pected the Lions to pun a _State
back tossed a pass to Bob Higgins
on the State one-yard line and that
lad continued running with the ball
until he had crossed the Pitt goal
line. This play so demoralized the
Panthers that they were never able
to get gtarted with the result that
Penn State won, 19-0.

Higgins New Coach »~

Higgins was appointed head coach
of the team at the beginning of the
season and although the results
which he has produced to date are
nothing for the folks back home to
get drunk over,‘ he can be ex
to bring a ﬁghting‘ team to the '53’
diam, one that will test the mettle
of the Panthers to the fullest ex-
tent. .

As for the score of this game, the
good old Campus Scout will cross
everybody up by refusing to predict
the score of this game. Nothing 18
certain in football. We've found
that out.

There . is one man, however, who
has been telling me his predictions
following the games and strange to
say his scores have been better than
mine. What a man! This man is
Charle Kappler. Good old Charley

Pitt Squad Meets Western
Reserve Group Here

 

 

_ With the uneasiness that accom-
panies their ﬁrst public appearance,

now passed. the members of the
Debdting Association are

Men's _
looking forward to their ﬁrst inter-
collegiate debate, » scheduled with
Western Reserve University, here,
for January 15. 4 c .
The debaters gave the first exten-
sion debate at Allegheny High

school, Monday afternoon, arguing .,
the question of unemployment _in-

surance. Although the limited "$11118 .
allotted to the team left no oppor-_ . -

tunity for the audience to render a

decision by popular vote,’ the argu-

ments of both sides werewell pre-
sented and any decision would have
been close. ' ‘

A second extension debate is-

scheduled for the. regular assembly
of Perry,Hi»gh school, Monday, De-
cember 1st. The same teampwhich
debated at Allegheny Highwill rep-
resent the squad/at the Perrysville
avenue school, debating the ques-
tion, “Resolved: That the Several
States Should Enact Legislation
Providing for Compulsory Unem-

ployment Insura.nce.” On the affirm-

ative side will be Cyril Jacobs, Bus.
Ad. '32,‘ and Edward T. Crowder
Jr., Col."31. Jess Spirer, Col. '31,
and Robert C. McClurkin, Col. ’31,
are to present the negative argu-
ments. ,

The third extension debate will be
held at Ambridge High school,
Thursday morning, December 4,
wherg the question of unemployment

insurance will again be argued. V A A

squad of four different men will en-
gage in their ﬁrst debate of the sea-
son at this time. Sam Strauss, Col.
'32, and Emanuel Fishkin, Bus. Ad.
'31, will argue for the affirmative.

(J_ while D. J . Butler, Bus. Ad. ’32, will

press the negative. ,

The ﬁrst intercollegiate debate
which was tentatively scheduled
with Penn State, *1 has been post-
poned until some time later in the
forensic season, because of the ill-
ability of the State team to meet
at the proposed date. The debate
with Western Reserve has been
scheduled to ﬁll the vacancy occa-
sioned by the Penn State with-
drawal.

lege, will attend a meeting of the

of Lt.-Colonel Cullen disbanding the

aroused much comment on the cam-
pvus. The order was effective last

No exp tion of the order has

and Drum Corps was formed at the
beginning‘ of.-the year and showed
prospects of becoming an important
‘unit of thebattalion. Both Col. C_ul-
len and Lieut. Wilson were putirﬂ
larly enthusiastic at the time of
inception. The body was composed
of twenty-four pieces ‘and appeared
with the band at the Notre Dame
game. Favorable comment on its
appearance was voiced throughout
the school following the game. ,

Another special order made _corn-.

ery Friday regardless of the weath-
er conditions. The cadets will ap-
pear for drill during the _drill pe-

weather will be conﬁned to class-
rooms assigned to each battery.

In preparation for the Penn State
game tomorrow, Pitt's one hundred
and twenty star musicians went
through their paces Friday after-
noon on their drill grounds. Forma-
tions of the Penn State letters was
the big event of the afternoon and

boys keep up the standard of work
which they have exhibited ingaines
throughout the year. Being the
ﬁnal game on the Pitt schedule, the
Penn State game will afford the lo-
cal musicians at little more incentive
to be at their best.

     Lustoms ?--- Why? ,
 » HERE IS MUCH HUMOR-g",n the announcement from Stu-

. dent Council that freshman customs for men. Will be‘

 formally closed at noon ‘today. If the ychairinan of the
Customs’ committee had not directed our attention to the fact
that these customs are still supposed to be ineffect, we should
1:-scarcely have given them another thought. They have». been
forgotten for these many weeks! _ l . I. .   V I

  Now that customs for the second consecutive year have
been a dismal failure, let’s give up! Student Council surely does
not illogically‘ consider them a tradition of the campus!_

 When they ﬂopped last year, the Customs’ committee ar-
, gum that it would be a slow development and require several
. years before their enforcement could be strengthened. But lack
of interest upon the part of upperc1assmen_ and disregard of
-1 any rules by the freshmen themselves should indicatethat there
isino desire-for this kind of traditionIat_Pitt. _ » -  ~‘

I 0 Student Council will probably perceive this when the mat-
«, gter comes up for discussion, and will wisely put aside“ the whole

'  of customs or regulagons. . .call them what you may 1,

Wednesday.

The delegates on Monday night
attended the , all—pi-Iess dance given
by the Columbus papers. ,,

An interesting feature, in the
form of a banquet, took place on
Tuesday evening. Marmon Pew, ed-
itor and publisher, and Frank Ful-
ler Shad, editor and publisher of
“The Philadelphia Bulletin” gave in-
terestin talks.

quent chapters committee, and Suf-

forts to secure a Sigma Delta Chi
national traveling secretary. The
motion will be discussed as an
amendment to the Constitution at
the next meeting.

The candy, fruit and miscellane-
ous stand that the Y. M. C. A. main-
tains in the Activities building is
doing a thriving business. The red
apples are being retailecl to hungry
students at a nickel per, and the
other edibles at regular rates. Par-
don us if we have given the impres-
sion that the apples are being sold
at more than regular rates. Larger
apples for a nickel we have never
seen sold.

a I ‘C’ ~ as

Last Saturday we visited the In-
ternational Art Exhibit and, after
seeing it, we jstillglike the perma-
nent collection the ‘best. One mat-
ter that especially’ impressed us as
we viewed the hundreds upon hun-
dreds of paintings that hung ﬂood-
hghted on the walls of the galleries
was the total lack of any photo-
graphic qualities in the pictures.
Also, the sight of so much canvas,
almost without exception in stretches
of at least ten square feet, made us
wonder what possible use would
ever be found for it. There seems
to be practically no demand. And
after all, there is only so much
plain wall surface in the world that
can be decorated with paintings.
Since paintings are such permanent
things, it has always been a mystery
to us how these» vast‘ expanses of
artistic effort are consumed. Of
€0111‘S€. there is a lot of room left
for such things in Alumni Hall but
who would ﬁnance the undertaking?
Even suI>posiI_1g_that it would take
only 200 paintings to .completely
deC01_‘a«I‘»e the halls, since the aver-
age cost of each of these canvases

is $400, that would be approximate-

ly $80,000 right there. It is a prob-
1?m3 the painter’s problem, and
since the,usua;l small apartment to-
‘day hasnt room for wallpaper, let
‘alone pictures, the difficulties in the
way of picture marketing‘ become
difficult indeed.

 COLLEGIANA 

A few days past we had an op-
portunity to hear one of those mys-
terious ._persons who are admittedly
Dramatic Readers. In s-pi-te of the
well-known talents of Ruth Draper
and Cornelia Otis Skinner, we had
always thought that a Dramatic
Reader was just an elocutionist who

had had some great
IN sorrow. Max Montor

PASSING changed this opin-

..' _ _ ion, for he proved his
legitimate acting ability by his ex-
cellent characterization in’ Street
_Scene. Mr. Montor gave us a read-
ing of King Lear which will, at
least, be memorable for its shading.
Power rang in his interpretation of
Lear’s outraged fatherhood; his
royal, despairing fury was literally
overwhelming. If he erred at all,
Mr._ Montor might be said to have
misjudged t'he amount of volume
necessary in Heinz “House, for his
interpretation of Lear was a triﬂe
bellicose. A little roaring is a tre-
mendous thing in a not-too-large
frame structure. Mr. Montor‘ re-
deemed himself, however, by the re-
straint and knife-sharpness of his
minor characterizations. His read-
ing eliminated the sub—plot, so that
the intensity of the main plot was
heightened to a taut emotional level.
One could desire little more of deli-
cacy andrestraint than Mr. Montor
gave to his Jester or to his inter-
pretation of Cordelia. It is a wor-
thy'axiom to “have no regrets,” of
course. But if there is any future
opportunity to hear a dramatic
reading of a play so full of beauty
and wisdom as is Lear, I trust we
may all take advantage of the
chance. "When we consider that a
dramatic reader ha to overcome the
double unreality 0
tion’’ without the aid of stage set-
ting, we may appreciate more fully
the skill and intelligence of Mr.
Montor’s reading; may we hear him
again some day.

Collembolans Plan

400 years ago in an old English
manor house, will be portrayed at
the annual Y“ tide Festival, to be
held in the ‘ room .of' the Hotel

John M. Henry, prominent local
attorney and Assistant United
States District Attorney, inaugu-
rated the series of free Tues ay
evening forums at the Y. M. and W.
H. A. Tuesday evening, . when he
gave an address on “Justice.”

The committee in charge of these
forums plans to have in’. its present
series distinguished men and women
who will speak on subjects interest-
ing to people in all walks of life.
The questions and discussions which
are conducted from. the floor after
each address are an addition to the
program.

George Keller, chairman of the
Current Events Luncheon Club, has
set Friday at 11:45 o’cldck as the
time for the weekly meeting of the
club. Two luncheons have already
been held, and “Y” members who
are interested in present-day hap-
penings, ﬁnd the meetings very in-
teresting.

Phillip La Follette, governor-
elect of the state of Wisconsin, and
son of the late Senator Robert La
Follette, will lecture at the Y. M.
and W. H. A. on “A Challenge,” De-
cember 2. —- ,

Mr. La Follette is well known for
his skill in presenting his material
in a convincing manner, and im-
presses his audiences with his sin-
cerity. He is truly “a great son of
a great father.”

With the production of “The Add-
ing Machine” by Elmer Rice, De-

 

cember 9 and 10, the “Y” Playhouse I

will change its admission prices, so
that the cost of a season ticket to
the next four plays will be $2.00,
and $.75 for general admission.
The second o-f the shows included
in the season subscription will be

comedy by Boris’ Glagolin, which
will be followed by “The Haunted

Bravo! Latest Campus Oddity
Braves Student Curiosity ‘
By Loud Braying

Fraternity initiations? No, of ‘
course not. Pitt changed its
mascot from the Panther to a
donkey? Who ever heard of
such a thing! And there isn’t
a zoo or circus around. here,
either. Can't you read the
signs? Then use your imagina-
tion. The Freiburg Passion
play and a donkey--read up on
your Biblical history.

Herr Esel (that’s donkey in

rman) maintained a stoical
attitude when I braved the lot
adloilling Syria Mosque to in-
terview him. ‘What is your
name, please?” I quavered. He
looked scornfully at me, and in
my embarrassed silence I
thought I Jieard him bray,
“Whoever heard of a German
donkey speaking English?”

A true reporter never stops
at rebuffs (according to Profes-
sor Maulsby), so I advanced to
get a closer view. I brought in
use all the feminine arts and
prescribed journalistic aids for
interviewing I could conjure.
But to no ail! Here was one
male who would not fall. He
advanced forward astep —- I
ﬂed. At the corner of Bigelow
and Bayard I dared to glance
back. There he sat gazing
scornfully at the hurrying stu-
dents in a manner that augured
ill for all ﬂedgling reporters! -

Hotel Schenley for a ﬁnal dress re-
hearsal. *

The festival is to be presented un-
der the title, “Christmasse in Merrie
England,” and will be enacted by a
cast of players under the direction
of Mr. Carl Cass, director of Pitt
Players. The festival will be sup-
ported by the choruses of the com-
§bined glee clubs of the University.
IPitt Players will also contribute to
the program with a. sketch, “St.
George and the Dragon,” to be pre-
sented as a part of the larger fes-
tival. .

Opening with a picture of the
t pical English manor household,
t e lord of themanor and his lady
are shown celebrating the Yuletide
festivities, attended by their serv-
ants and followers. The host of
grateful servants and cavaliers join
in the singing of Christmas carols
for the lord and lady. Jester and
cjaroler hold sway for a time in the
round of merrimeiit. And then a
group of traveling. Oxford students
present themselves before the lord
and lady, offering to entertain the
assembled guests with a short play.
These are the.players who present
the sketch, “St. George and the
Dragon.”

and singing, and the guests of the

The fourth ﬂoorwill have on

headquarters of W. W. A.,_ W. I
S. G. A., and Y. W. C. A-. After
the committee has decided ap-
proximately how much space
each office may have, they will
confer with the heads of the or-
ganizations as to the‘ space it
needs, and in this wa the ﬁnal
allotment will be in e. I ‘

Concerning the interior deco-
ration of the Women’s. ﬂoor, the
