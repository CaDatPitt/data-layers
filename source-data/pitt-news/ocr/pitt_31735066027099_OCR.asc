SGB bid for trustee vote on hold

hMe|issa Blackwood

Less than a week after vowing
to secure a vote on the Board of
Trustees, Pitt’s newest student
leader has learned the banal reali-
ties of Pitt’s bureaucratic system.

During last week’s Student
Government Board inauguration,
new president Justin DalMolin and
much of his board agreed to make
gaining a seat on the Board of
Trustees one of their top priorities.

But at yesterday’s University
Senate Council meeting, DalMolin
passed up his first official oppor-
tunity to raise the issue with Pitt
faculty and administrators, avoid-
ing any hint of controversy that
might have upset the friendly,
“welcomeiback” tone of the meet-
ing.
DalMolin now says he plans to
wait until SGB members have had
more time to work up a formal
proposal before presenting the idea
to the Senate Council.

“One thing I’ve learned from
working on the Student
Government Board is to be very
prepared when dealing with the
administration,” ' DalMolin said.
“It’s a one shot deal. If you don’t
do it right the first time, it will
blow up in your face.”

DalMolin said he hopes to
have a proposal for gaining a seat
on the Board of Trustees ready for
the Senate Council’s formal plan-
ning meeting in March.

“We want to be able to say this
has been drawn up by the board.
This is endorsed by the board.
What are you going to do about it
right now?” he said.

Board member Brandi Miller
agreed that the new members need

more time to work together as a ’

group, and added that yesterday’s
meeting was not really the appro-
priate time to raise such a hot
topic.

“This was more of a ‘feel-
good’ meeting, a chance to get to
know the people we’ll be working
with on the Senate Council,” she
said.

In keeping with that theme,
yesterday’s half—hour long meeting
was short and sweet.

According to Senate Council
President Keith McDuffie, it may
be one of the shortest meetings on
record. -
“Even though we didn’t have a
big agenda, 1 still thought it was a
good idea to get together to find
out what is on people’s minds,”_
McDuffie said. “You never know

RN opens heart to transplant patients

Jennifer Haluska

 

It’s three o’clock in the after-
noon; you’re at the mall shopping,
and your pager goes off. You rush
to the nearest phone, and call the
number. You hear someone on the
other end of the line say, “We think
we have found you a compatible
heart. You’d better get to the hos-
pital.” You hang up, and you’re on
your way.

For Wendy Deis, one of the
transplant coordinators at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, this is a daily routine.

Deis, along with several other
coordinators, tries to make things a
little easier on the families affected
by transplants. ‘

Deis, a registered nurse who

graduated from the University of
Bridgeport, began her career as an
ICU nurse, but soon found a par-
ticular interest in working with
donor patients and their families.
“Typically, donors are young,
healthy people who suﬂ’er a fatal
injury,” said Deis. “It’s as though

i one minute they are walking and

talking and the next minute they
are gone. I ﬁnd it to be very
rewarding to be able to help farni—
lies through this type of traumatic
experience.”

While working with donors,
she realized that what she really
wanted was to work with trans-
plants. When Deis began working
at UPMC, she handled all trans-
plant patients -— before and after
care, for both young and old. As
transplants began taking oﬁ° at a

rapid rate, more coordinators had
to be brought in, and Deis special-

ized in pre-heart transplants for

adults.

The coordinator’s responsibil-
ity is to follow the patient. She fol-
lows her patients from the time
they are referred to her unit until
the actual transplant, when a post-
transplant coordinator will take
over. ‘ .

The ﬁrst contact Deis makes
with a potential transplant patient
is after they are referred by a
physician. “After taking a referral,
I have to go over the patient’s
medical records trying to decide if
it is a suitable candidate or not,”
said Deis. “And after I review all
of this I arrange for the patient to
come to Pittsburgh for an evalua-

Unexpected liaison
may ease tensions  
between frats, CWO

Anthony Breznican

 

Years of tension between a women’s
group and Pitt fraternities may end as a
result of “ground-breaking” appoint-
ments by the new student government.

During a retreat designed to unite the
new members, President Justin DalMolin
surprised his board by appointing Christa
Douaihy as a liaison between the SGB
and Interfraternity Council.

“Everyone thought Christa was a rad-
ical, and during the election some called
her a ferni-nazi and things like that,” said
DalMolin. “But she’s aware of the stereo-
types and is willing to go against them. I
think her appointment to the IFC is a
good way to do that, to dismantle the
stereotypes on both sides.”

As a liaison, board members act as
SGB go—betweens to the 10 governance
groups on campus representing student
interest.

In a past interview , with The Pitt
News, Douaihy said one of her goals is to
get the Campus Women’s Organization

recognized as one ‘of these groups, and‘

while her involvement with Pitt fraterr1i—
ties is surprising, her past with CWO is
not.

“My background is in women’s
issues, and multi—cultural issues, and the
problems of sexual assault on campus,”
Douaihy said. “In the past, there has been

tension between CWO and the IFC on
these matters, so it’s unusual, and it’s
exciting for someone like me to be work-
ing with them. I think it can only beneﬁt
both groups.”

Relations between the CWO and IFC
have been strained since .an indecent
assault charge against the brothers of Phi
Gamma Delta two years ago.

According to an article on Sept. 26,
1994, in The Pitt News, the fraternities
social privileges were revoked by the,IFC
as punishment, and the CWO denounced
the sentencing as “a slap on the wrist.”

“There has been tension between the
CWO and IFC, and it’s still
omnipresent,” Douaihy said. “But you
don’t put someone like Douaihy on the
IFC unless you want to resolve those dif-
ferences. I think they’ll be happy that
we’re breaking down barriers.”

Laura Bardwell, publicity chair for

CWO, said she was happy to hear of the 0

appointment, and that Douaihy could be a
strong inﬂuence in bringing the two
groups together.

“We’re hoping this will open the
lines of communication between CWO
and IFC,” she said. “That’s the first step
in making members of both groups more
aware of things like date—rape and rohyp—
nol (the date—rape drug).”

IFC President Patrick Callahan could
not comment on the appointment, but
Douaihy said she’s been in contact with
him and the response has been positive.

“I’ve worked with Pat, and he knows
me, and things seem pretty cool,”
Douaihy said. “They know I’m not out to
get them. You can’t get anywhere if you
can’t work together.”

Though Douaihy and the IFC is the
most unusual combination resulting from
the SGB retreat, it’s not the only untradi—
tional one.

In the interest of encouraging unity
across the campus, DalMolin said the

 

THE PITT NEWS

 

eclectic mix of board members inspired

him to appoint them to unusual posts.
“[Board member] David Eisenberg is

a Greek, so you’d think it’d make sense

‘to put him on the Inteifraternity Council,

but instead I put someone like him on the
nurses organization,” DalMolin said. “I
did that with Christa and all the board
members and hope it’ll be a good learn-
ing experience for everyone involved.”

Board member Ryan Weidenmiller
agreed the retreat helped bond the new
student government, and said he thinks
the differing opinions and backgrounds
of the board will only be rewarding for
the student body.

“Because of the diversity, not only on
the board but in the entire University,
these appointments should keep every-
body open-nrinded and require us to lis-
ten to each other,” he said. “Even if we
don’t always agree, we can learn to be
respectful of other ideas, and work
together toward making SGB more effi-
cient.”

In another unexpected move,
DalMolin appointed Douaihy his assis-
tant in charge of running meetings and
other SGB business in his absence.

“It doesn’t put her in a position above
any of the other board members, but she
has some added responsibilities as a
result of this,” DalMolin said. “I admit I
was concerned about all the rumors of her
being a radical, and so on, but after get-
ting to know her and the rest of the board
this weekend, that has been put to rest in
my eyes.”

Douaihy said she was surprised by
this added responsibility.

“I’m just a sophomore now and have
no seniority on the board, so I’m
extremely happy that Justin felt I could
serve in this position,” she said. “I think
[DalMolin’s] moves to unite this board
and campus are very tactical and impres-

tion, because we get referrals from all over
the country.” 0

During the evaluation process, one of
Deis’s responsibilities is to educate the
patient and his family. She explains what
the operation entails, and what they should
anticipate in the future.

“At first, I was running from room to
room, saying the sarrre thing 20 different
times to 20 different people. So I decided to
bring all the patients together and say the
same thing to everyone at once,” said Deis.

A computer does a search for donors
and prints out all the potential matches. The
patients’ names are then sorted out ﬁrst by
blood type and size, then by medical
urgency, how sick one is, and ﬁnally, how
long one has waited. ’

Deis then evaluates the patients that are
potentially compatible and reviews them
with the physician to decide which patient

 

 FROM PAGE 1 

is the best candidate for a transplant.

“It’s very exciting, sometimes it feels
like detective work, trying to track someone
down in the middle of the night,” said Deis.

While Deis’s job is basically over at
this point, it’s only the beginning for the
next patient, who might not be so lucky.
Many lives have been lost due to the short-
age of donors.

“The need always outweighs the sup-
ply,” said Deis. “Everyone knows about
transplantation, and everyone knows about
the miracle of transplantation, but does
everyone have their donor card signed?
No.”

Despite feeling bad for patients she
loses, Deis concentrates on the ones she can
help save.

“I love what I do, and ﬁnd it very
rewarding to be able to help patients,” said
Deis.

Drastic measures needed to
defeat textbook price gouging

The editorial that we ran yesterday entitled “How to beat the

bookstores” gives the advice that rather than pay an exorbitant

amount of money for a packet of photocopied materials, you
should get together with other students, buy one copy, and photo-
copy the packet to be distributed throughout the group.

Some people thought it necessary to bring to our attention that
this is advocating copyright infringement. Yes, we are well aware
of that, but what we were advocating is a little bit of civil disobedi-
ence. As Henry David Thoreau refused to pay his taxes to ﬁnance
a war he thought was unjust, we too must take a stand for what we
believe in. We believe that course materials should be fairly priced
to accommodate the rather limited ﬁnancial resources of students.

We are not saying that copyrights are pointless. Original

thought and work must be protected, and that is why copyrights
exist. It ought to be just as illegal to charge $20 for stapled photo-
copies, that is, to charge signiﬁcantly more than it costs to repro-
duce the materials, as it is illegal to photocopy copyrighted materi-
als.
' For those who are squeamish about violating copyright laws,
an alternative would be to‘do your homework in the bookstore. For
your convenience, we’d recommend going at a time when the
bookstore isn’t extremely busy to limit the number of intenuptions
in your work.

We must stand up against an unjust system and demand that
our interests be considered as well as those of the bookstores and
the publishing companies. There are alternatives to requiring stu-
dents to buy overpriced books. Companies like Dover and Penguin
publish books at inexpensive prices. These so-called “thrift edi-
tions” include works such as “The Importance of Being Earnest”
and even “Civil Disobedience.” What about taking a look at them
as an example and an alternative?

Until a cheaper alternative is found to charging small fortunes
for course materials, we, as a student body, are forced to ﬁnd our
way around the system. If photocopying course materials or doing
our homework in the bookstore are the only ways in which to get
an education at this University without going to debtor’s prison,
then perhaps that’s exactly what we have to do.

Are you happy or just content?

 
 

It seems to elude most human

beings, or at least the ones whom I .

know. At best, I know a few who
consider themselves to be content.
Contentment and happiness are two
entirely different animals.
Contentment is often mistaken
as happiness. How many times
have we heard or said, “Why am I
so depressed? I have everything
going for me; I should be happy.
So, why am I so miserable?” Good
question. The answer lies in the dif-
ference between the concepts of
contentment and happiness.
Contentment is achieving a
balance between the forces in one’s
life until things work. We’ve
always been told that moderation is
the key to happiness, but in actuali-
ty, it is the key to contentment.

Moderation is the art of getting

through life with the least amount
of suffering. If one never gets
drunk, one never has a hangover.
One who doesn’t take risks will
never feel paralyzing fear.
Unfortunately, while avoiding suf-
fering, one also avoids extreme
pleasure. Someone who never
drinks will never feel the freedom
of lowered social inhibitions.
Someone who doesn’t take risks
will never feel the ecstasy of an
adrenaline rush. I’m not advocating
stupidity here. No one should get so
bliﬂrering drunk as to forget one’s
own name. No one should take
risks that practically guarantee fail-
ure. I am not advocating modera-
tion either. Happiness is experienc-
ing life to the fullest, taking all it has
to offer. Moderation and content-
ment are more about avoidance and
self-imposed sheltering.

 

. _ .. . .. .. ...A. ,_. .. _ .. _{ _,__.g. ,.,,o;.,_, _ , . , ff. (..r. ..
Happiness is an elusive demon.

This is the main reason for that
restless feeling. Despite having
achieved a balance in life, there is
the sense that something is missing.
Only in tempered extremism can
there be happiness. By tempered
extremisml mean to stop at the bor-
ders of stupidity, or the “Don’t Play
in Traffic Rule.” The stupidity bor-
der is different for every person. An
expert in mountain climbing plans a
trip to the summit of Mount
Everest. He is still well within the
stupidity borders. An overweight
Florida businessman with heart and
kidney conditions would not be
within his  I

Another key to happiness is
ﬁrlﬁllment. Two things keep people
from feeling fulﬁlled. First is the
misconception that achieving ful-
ﬁllment is easy and can be attained
with various short-cuts. Sony folks,
but fulﬁllment requires suffering.
As things go, the greater the pain,
the greater the fulﬁllment. This is
fairly obvious -— the more work
one puts in, the greater the reward.
What is not so obvious is that it is
possible to learn to enjoy the suﬁer—
ing experienced on the road to a
particular goal. Zen mystics have
long told us that suffering is the key
to fulﬁllment. On a more tangible
level, even though long-distance
runners experience great pain, they
love to run. They are not sickor
masochistic individuals. They have
merely learned to adapt to their sit-
uation. When we have a goal that is
important to us, we can do the
same. Meditating about goals and
reﬂecting on the steps taken (at least
once a week) is a good start. We
often get so caught up in our own
little worlds and each speciﬁc task

‘i that the big picture begins to disap-

pear. One way to combat that is to

sit and think in quiet reﬂection
about where our lives are going on
a regular basis. .

The second obstacle that keeps
us from fulﬁllment is a practical
one. Fulﬁllment is based on living
out our ideologies. The more close-
ly we live out our ideologies, the
more we are fulﬁlled. However, the
rest of the world is seldom in agree-
ment. One decides to become a
vegetarian based on the principle
any mistreatment of animals is
morally wrong. To live this ideal is
virtually impossible. Even if one
buys all their food from an organic
food store, food is not the only thing
affected. Name almost any house-
hold product and it will invariably
be associated with some sort of ani-
mal mistreatment. This is not to say
that striving to live this ideal is
ignoble, but it is to say that the line
must be drawn somewhere. Many
people believe that animal rr1istreat—
ment is wrong, but there are few
who would die naked and malnour-
ished in the woods someplace for
this ideal. There are some who may.
Note: I am using this as an example,
and it is exaggerated. I am aware of
the increasing availability of animal
safe products and a fully nourishing

~ diet without meat. I am merely say-

ing that perfection is impossible, in
this case and many others.

It is about priorities. There are
some ideals that we are willing to
die for and some over which the
continuance of our own life takes
precedence. It is not hypocrisy to
compromise one’s ideals for the
sake of another ideal. Dead men tell
no tales, and very, very few are
remembered enough to make a dif-
ference.

The world of college basketball is where it's at

Last year was suppos to
Armageddon for college basketball. The
exodus of underclassmen leaving college for
the NBA draft, combined with the new trend

 

 

of high school players jumping directly to
the pros, ﬁnally reached the point where it
seemed that no good players would be
around in college anymore. Not only were
all the naysayers wrong (three words:
Duncan, Vaughn, Foitson), but college bas-
ketball, even without the players that left, is
still better than the NBA. I

The attraction of college basketball was
never in its stars. You go to an NBA game to

I 7

see Michael Jordan score 30 points, or to see
Shaq miss free throws. In college, you never
know who the star of the game is going to be.
At different points in this young season,
Chad Varga, Jason Maile, and Vonteego
Cummings have all been Pitt’s most valu-
able player. VVithout the superstars to watch,
college fans cheer for a whole team. That’s
how it should be, because even though the

Several Panthers pick up the pace

   

 

Pitt’s track relay teams, and a hand-
ful of other squad members, will advance
to postseason championships following
last weekend’s meet at Princeton.

The men’s and women’s seasons
opened Dec. 7 against West Virginia, and
since then, the teams have been busy.

Senior women’s captain Angie
Martin has qualiﬁed for the NCAA
championship meet in the 800 meters,
and she has met the East Coast Athletic
Conference qualifying standard in the
500 meters.

Last weekend at Princeton, Martin
ran legs on the mile and 2—mile relay
teams, both of which qualiﬁed for the
ECAC championships.

Sophomore leader Trecia Smith has
qualiﬁed for the NCAA championship in
the long jump and triple jump. She is an
ECAC qualiﬁer in the shot put, high
jump, 55 meters, 55 meter hurdles, 200
meters, and the pentathlon.

Smith was also a member of the mile
relay and the shuttle hurdle relay teams
that qualiﬁed for the ECAC meet last

weekend.

“We have two true standouts in
Angie Martin and Trecia Smith. They’ve
done some super stuff,” said Pitt Coach
Steve Lewis.

For the men, senior captain Jerel
Williams has one of the fastest 200 meter
times in the East so far this season,
according to Lewis. Williarns is also part
of Pitt’s mile relay, one of the East’s
fastest teams.

“Jerel and Orrel Green are really
leading the men. Our captains for both
the men and the women have been major
contributors. They have the top scores
and times. They’re doing a very good
job,” Lewis said.

Many of those Panthers who have
qualiﬁed for the postseason meets did so
at Princeton. The relay teams had a par-
ticularly outstanding meet and have all
qualiﬁed for the championships.

“Our plan was to start getting our
relays qualiﬁed for the championship
meets,” Lewis said. ‘This was a fim meet.
We didn’t want to work kids too hard, so
we limited the individual events.”

' Of the four women’s relay races, Pitt
won three. Joetta Purter, Tamika Dorin,

Chantee Earl, and Angie Martin won the
2-iriile relay in 9:05.05. Shana Fadis,
Martin, T recia Smith, and Purter took the
mile relay in 3:48.84. The shuttle hurdle
team of Kianga lee, Jennifer Williams,
Fadis, and Smith won their race in a
meet—record time of 29.50 seconds.

In the fourth relay event, the distance
medley, Pitt took second place with
12:22.54, 19 seconds behind Princeton.
The only Pitt woman to win an individual
event was Trecia Smith with a 45-11 1/2
throw in the shot put.

The men’s shuttle hurdle relay team
of Oriel Green, Jack Jeﬁieys, Jeremy
Ward, and Jerel Williarns won their race
in 29.00 seconds.

Two other Pitt teams ﬁnished sec-
ond. The mile relay team ran 3: 19.04, two
seconds oﬂ° Princeton’s winning time.
Pitt’s 2—mile team ﬁnished in 7:50.77,
eight seconds off Princeton’s mark.
Green was the lone individual winner for
the Pitt men, winning the '55 meter-hur-
tiles in 7.50.

ECAC’s are March 1 and 2. The
women will compete at Dartmouth, and
the men will be at Princeton. NCAA’s are
March 7 and 8 at Indianapolis.

Angie Martin has been a fierce competi-

tor for Pitt since her career began.

Despite missing coaches, Panther grapplers have big weekend

‘Brian Knavish

Talk about a busy weekend. Not only
did the wrestlingteamhavethreematchesin
four days, but they also lost their starting
134-pounder, Chad Jesko to an injury. On
top of that, both of the team’s assistant
coaches were involved in car accidents pre-
venting them ﬁom attending Sunday’s tri-

9 meet with Ohio State and Cuyahoga

Community College.

The lack of coaches made the match
interesting, leaving head coach Rande
Stottlemyer as the only coach for two mats
of action. This setback did not hamper the
team’s peifonnance. Pitt emerged victori-
ously in all four of their matches by a com-
bined score of 127-41. The Panthers
thrashed Slippery Rock and Wﬂkes
University on Fri. and followed that with
two wins on Sun. ’

Panther grapplers won eight of 10 indi-
vidual matches against home team Slippery

Rock in the 23-8 Win, including pins by

  

heavyweight Rick Vetterol and 118-pounder
Chris Stevens.

Rob Loper (126), Larry Sprecher (158),
and Jacob Schaus (158) came away with
minor decisions (victory by 7 points or less),
while Bryan Matusic (177) and Mark Bodo
(I90) won in dynamic fashion with major
decisions (victory by eight or more points).

“I tried to push myself, even though I
had the match in hand,” Matusic said. “I
know that later in the season I’m going to
need that competitive edge in some closer

John Vsrithrow collected a forfeit at 167.

In the second match of Friday’s tri-
meet, Pitt destroyed Wilkes University 34-
15. Pitt started many second teamers in this
match which made the victory all the more
impressive.

Pin falls were collected by Larry
Sprecher and Jeﬂ° Skakalski (190) —- his ﬁrst
ever collegiate victory.

“I was really excited. I just hope I can do
it more often,” Skakalski said ‘This proved

to metliatlcanwinatthisleve .”

Eric Knopsnyder (126), Brian Pardini
(158), and John VVithrowA (167) also earned
victories between bookend forfeits ‘by Chris
Stevens (118) and heavyweight Rick
Vettorel. .

In the closest match of the weekend, Pitt
edged Big Ten opponent Ohio State19—15 in
a contest that was more one-sided than it
appeared. Panther grapplers collected 13
takedowns compares to OSU’s six.

Chris Stevens narrowly defeated Ohio
State’s Matt Fratta at the 118 lb. weight class.

That win was followed by two losses at
126 and 134. Rob Loper lost 5-4, and Dan
Kelley, who was ﬁlling in for the injured

Chad Jesko, was pinned by Ohio ‘State’s '

Brian Roskovich.

“It was 6-6 in the third period,” Dixon
explained. “Coach [Stottlemyer] told me to
waituntiltheendoftheperiodandtakehim
down.” iffy
That is exactly what Dixon did. He shot
in, earned his two pointsglet his opponent

back up, and played defense for the remain-
ing 10 seconds to secure the 8-7 victory.

Lariy Sprecher suifeied a tough, dou-
ble-overtirne defeat at 150. With the score
knotted at one, OSU’s Dan Dicesare earned
a one point escape in the 30 secondziide-out
Peﬁod "

The remainder of the contest was dom-
inated by Pitt. Jacob ,Sc'haris (158), John
Withrow (167), Rick'"‘Vettorel (I-Iwt), and
6th ranked Mark Bodo (190) man-handled
their Buckeye foes.

The only loss among Pitt’s upper
weight-class wrestlers came when Bryan
Matusic lost 8-2 to eighth-ranked Mitch
Clark

‘‘I had all the olfense in the match, but
he ended up with the points,” Matusic
explained. “He’s one of the tougher wrestlers
in country, but I feel pretty conﬁdent that I
could beat him if we wrestle again.”

The other match of the day again gave
the Panthers an opportunity to gain soirie

Carolina bittersweet for Pitt

.949" .T°.w

 

The women’s swim team split a pair
with the Carolina two—some last weekend,
losing to the Tarheels on Fri. 189-101 and
then dominating N.C. State 174-68 on Sat.

' On Fri., the Lady Panthers pounced on
UNC in the ﬁrst event. The 400-yard med-
ley relay team of Beth Grube, Erin Bissell,
Jennifer Slack, and Heather Brennan won
in 4:01.41, but it would not be‘Pitt’s day, as
they would only capture one other swirn—
ming event. The win came in the 400 free
relay by the team of Grube, Brennan,
Melissa Burns, and Isabel Dejo in 3:38.04.

“They are a top 15 team. They had too
much depth for us,” said Head Coach
Marian Cassidy-Keen. “Even though we
lost, it really helps to race against the best
teams in the country. Even though the score
waslopsided, I was pleased with the way
we swam because we haven’t raced in a
while. This competition will make us bet-
ter.”

Freshmen Jamie Tomazich impressed
as she won both the diving events by more
than 50 points. This Wexford, Pa. native is
a high school All-American and the reign-
ing WPIAL diving champion from nearby
North Allegheny High School.

“Jamie has done an outstanding job.
She has been consistent all year and is
developing into one of the best divers in the
East,” said Keen.

North Carolina’s dominance in the
pool was evident in only allowing Pitt six

 

top three ﬁnishes out of 14 races. Besides
the twolrelay wins, Grube managed a sec-
ond in the 100 back with a 59.29. Bissel
(1:07.86) and Nicole Palombo (1208.96)
placed second and third, respectively in the
100 breast. In a close race, Nikki Clifford
squeaked out a third in the 200 ﬂy with a
2:09.96.

Against N. C. State, the team avenged
their loss from the day before by spanking
the Wolfpack in winning 12 of 13 events.
Sophomore Samantha Chabotar took a first
in the 1,000 free (10:28.45) and 500 free
(5204.70), and a second in the 200 free
(1258.13). Tomazich again.dorninated the
diving events in winning both by over 60
points. The relay team of Grube, Bissell,
Brennan, and Liz Perry won the 200 med-
ley relay in 4:00.56. Grube continued her
excellent weekend in winning the 200 back
(2208.55) and was part of the winning 400
free relay (3242.45). Brennan, the fresh-
man, won her specialty, the 50 free, in
25.09. She is another top—notch recruit
brought in this year by Keen to bolster the
sprinting events.

“It was good to see us turn it around
the next day. I’m very excited about how
we swam. On paper we thought this meet
would be closer than it was. When we beat
them in the ﬁrst relay, it took the wind from
their sales, and we went on to win,” said
Keen.

Up for Pitt this weekend is another
double dosage of quality teams. Pitt starts
by hosting Penn State on Fri. and ending
with West Virginia on Sat. at Trees Pool.

Column

NBA may not recognize it, basketball is a
team sport.

Everybody knows that the NBA is
based on the marketing of its superstars,
and that makes the league’s style of play
about as exciting as Saturday night at a
nursing home. Every play in the NBA
goes something like this: Stockton brings
the ball up the court, waits around for
Malone to post up. Passes to Malone.
Malone turns around, knocks a few people
over (of course, no ref would dare call a
foul on him), maybe draws a foul. He
takes a shot if he can, otherwise he passes
back out to Stockton, who shoots from
outside.

College basketball is almost an entire-
ly different game. College teams press and
trap and pass the ball to someone because
he’s open, whereas pro teams pass the ball
to someone because of his name. The
result is that college teams get steals and
fast breaks, and it’s not always the same
people getting the ball fed to them inside
on every possession.

 

 

FROM PAGE 7 

The Bulls wonlast year’s NBA cham-
pionship, and it wasn’t close. It’s not any
closer this year. The Bulls may not go 72-
10 again, but they will still win the title
with very little competition.

Now, let’s look at the defending
NCAA champions, Kentucky. Already
this season, they have lost to Clemson and
Mississippi, and they won’t go undefeated
the rest of the way. Plus, there are a dozen
other teams (Kansas, Wake Forest, and
Cincinnati to name a few) just like
Kentucky: very talented, but vulnerable to
defeat on any given night.

Speaking of champions, the NCAA

basketball tournament is hands down the
best postseason system for any sport in the
known universe, and it certainly beats any-
thing’ the NBA has. Ifyou aren’t convinced
that college basketball is superior to the
NBA, just wait until March.

“I hadn’t been wrestling lately. This
match gave me a chance to get into a
rhythm which helped me later on in the
Ohio Sate match,” Dixon said.

Panthers’ next match is Sat. night versus
Navy at Cannon Mac high school.
