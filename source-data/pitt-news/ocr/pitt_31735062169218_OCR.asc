  Dr. Robert P. Newman
 Retires from WPDU;
Debate Alumni Return

“I’m simply going to shift the scene of operation,” commented
Dr. Robert P. Newman, retiring director of the William Pitt ‘De-
bating Union (WPDU), at the Annual Awards Banquet which hon-
ored Dr. Newman. “I expect to be active in analyzing the evidence
handed to the public by other media,” he continued. With these
words he assured more than 100 debaters, debate alumni, and guests
on Monday that he would continue his crusade against those who
deviate from presenting what is valid and substanﬁable.

l 3‘

Dr. David H. Kurtzman and many distinguished graduates of

the University added their praise of Dr. Newman and the WPDU
to the customary rituals of greetings and award presentations. Rev.
Gregory Rene, debate coach and teacher from Central Catholic
High School in Pittsburgh, spoke of Dr. Newman's “commitment
to intellectual integrity.” This integrity, he commented, will~ re-
main a lasting tribute to Dr. Newman.

When Dr. Newman .officially concludes his 16 years with the
WPDU, he will leave behind one of the most ‘highly praised debate

and speech organizations in the
nation. The praise is w'ell-de-
served because the Union has
had seven teams qualify for the
National Debate Tournament
since 1953, besides having num-

A _erous champions in state debate

. east Missouri

    
 
 

and speech competitions. How-
ever, Dr. Newman feels that the
greatest compliment received by
the WPDU is that “Pitt is the
only school approved by the Com-
mitteee on International Speech
and Debate to send debaters
abroad.”” The WPDU has used
the sanction in its visits to Ja-
maica, and in May three mem-
bers of the Union will travel to
England for a series of debates

in English universities.

“The success of the Union may
be attributed to the Public De-
bate Program which is more
‘substantial that other ratiﬁed
debate programs,” Dr. Newman
believes. In this program mem-

»- bers of the WPDU, representing

the University, speak before
high school audiences through-
out the country. Including the
orthodox competitive debates,
Union members have partici-
pated in over 6,908 debates, in-
cluding multiple debates, in
front of more than 563,000 peo-
ple since 1952.

Dr. Newman received his un-
dergraduate education at North-
State Teachers
College (1939-41) and University
of Redlands, Calif. (1941-42). He
attended Divinity School at the
University of Chicago (1942-43)
before serving in the US Army
from 1943 to 1945. At Oxford
University, Dr. Newman was
awarded his Honors BA in philo-
sophy, politics, _and economics
in 1948 and his MA in 1952.

Dr. Newman Became a full
professor at the University in
1960. He left the University last
spring to be a visiting professor
at the University of Hawaii for
one term.

  Assembly Convenes

by FRANK ALTMAN

A sparsely populated SU Ballroom was the scene of
the ﬁrst Student Government (SG) General Assembly. The
new Off-Campus Housing ‘Committee, the new dormitories
and apathy highlightedlthe event.

The General Assembly was created, according to the
SG constitution, to better acquaint the various campus or-

ganizations with new develop-
ments and with legislation pass-
ed by SC, and to provide a
forum where new ideas for stu-
dent action -could be developed.

The assembly" heard reports
concerning the activities of the
SG Senate, the functioning of the
Allocations Committee (see sep-
arate story Wednesday), some
contributions of this year's Men's
Dormitory Council (MDC), the
workings of the Calendar Com-
mittee and the plans of the Off-
Campus Housing Committee. »

Commenting on the location
of the new dorms, MDC Presi-
dent Terry Gordon _explained
that ﬁve alternatives were "avail-
able for construction. The dorms
could have been built in Forbes
Field, behind the Common Fa-
cilities Building, or Panther Hol-
low, but investigation revealed
that the hill is the only place

that fulﬁlls the requirements of

, readily available land- where

construction can begin immedi-
ately.

Jack La Pietra and ‘his Off-
Campus Housing Committee
have announced plans to begin’
a pilot project in the Oakland
area this summer. “The com-
mittee will determine which
Oakland residents intend to rent
their property, whether they
would wish to list their dwell-
ings through the University of
Pittsburgh, if they would sub-
mit to an inspection of their
rooms, and if they practice dis-
crimination againstpersons
seeking housing,” claimed La
Pietra.

Lists of ‘all satisfactory dwell- I

ings will describe the price, num-
ber of rooms, private or shared
bath, kitchen facilities, and the
question of a lease.

‘Angry Arts’ Protests War;
Features Dr. Montgomery

Dr. David Montgomery of the
University history department
will !be the featured speaker in
a program of the “Angry Arts
Against the War” this Saturday
at 8 p.m. in the Pitt Field House.
Dr. Montgomery participated in
the November 4, 1966, “Speak-
Out” on Vietnam and he is on
the board of the Allegheny Alli-
ance.

“They Made a Desert and Call-
ed It Peace" is the theme of the

of Dan Smullyan. After the pro-
gram there will be a candlelight
procession through Oakland to
an exhibit of original art at Mt.

This activity was formed to
direct the Pittsburgh student ac-
tivities of Vietnam Week, April
8-15.

This week of local programs
of protest will build toward
mass demonstrations April 15

cisco. Round-trip transportation

ranged through Mary, Shinhofen,

 
 
 

locations Committee. Allocations
will be made for the entire year,
not term by term to recognized
undergraduate groups. Also, the
Committee will be handling all
monies given by the University
to student organizations.

In the past, the Committee al-
located funds received from a
$5 assessment of all undergrad-
uate, full-time students. For the
next ﬁscal year, the state will
pay this assessment for the full-
time, undergraduate students.
But the Allocations Committee
will also be giving out funds
previously appropriated by the
office of the Dean of Student Af-
fairs. It will, be allocating all
University monies for the opera-
tion of student organizations.

Applications for funds from
the Committee for the next fis-
cal year will be available April
15 in 156 CL and must be re-
turned to that office on or be-
fore May 15. The application
packages will include a copy of
the Committee’s policies and
procedures, a model budget to
used as. a guide, and six appli-
cation forms. Returned applica-
tions must include an explana-
tion of, how the organization will
use its requested allocation.

The May 15 deadline will al-
low the Committee six ‘weeks to
review requests, present recom-
mendations to the SG Senate,
and reconsider any requests not
approved by the Senate before
the beginning of the fiscal year,
July 1.

On the application forms, each
organization must designate an

-individual who will be available

for an interview if one is re-
quested by the organization or
by the Committee. If an organi-

zation asks for an interview, the ‘\

Committee will grant it.

The same procedure and ap- '

plication will be followed for
emergency money requests with
the addition of an explanation
of the emergency nature of the

-request. These requests may be

made throughout the year by
any student organization rec-
ognized by the SG Recognitions
Committee. However, the Com-
mittee reserves the right to de-
cide whether a request is indeed
an emergency and whether it
should be considered at all. Only
a certain amount will be set
aside for emergency requests, so
the Committee urges organiza-

tions to make their yearly bud- ~

gets as complete and accurate
as possible.

All actions of the Committee ~
are not ﬁnal until approval by '

the SG Senate. The Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs also reserves a veto
power over allocation decisions,
but will have no voting power
in the Committee.

When reviewing requests for

funds, the Committee will take 6

into consideration:

>The record of ﬁnancial sup-
port given in the past by the
University to an organization.‘
since recognition.

VT-he amount of ﬁnancial
support raised by the member-
ship and the amount of extra-
University support.

>The degree to which the
program beneﬁts the University
Community,

~> The status of proposed.pro-
gramming as related to the or-
ganization’s purpose as stated
in the organization's constitu-
tion or by-laws. ,

ming adds to the diversity and

enrichment of the overall activ- ‘

»A Message

To Seniors
By Chancellor David H. Kurtzman

From time to time, The Pitt News opens its columns to me to
provide me with another and valuable medium for reaching the
student body. I would like to use its hospitality today, in this, its
’,_last issue of the winter term.

‘ My message is to the graduating seniors.

g In a very real way, I feel that I'm graduating with you. The
.forthco'ming commencement will be my, final commencement as
chancellor of the university. At this time, I will “graduate” to
(chancellor emeritus.

, And for me, as I hope it will be for you, still another period
"of learning will follow as this milestone slips behind me.

That really is the core of the message—that learning does not
i end with a handshake and the presentation of a diploma. learning
, should continue for as long as you breathe and take nourishment.
‘ The mind is not limited by the formal boundaries of terms and
degrees. .

In your years at the university," I. imagine that you have learn-
ed more outside -the classroom than you have learned inside the
classroom. This is no reflection on your excellent teachers; it is
‘simply the way of life. Life teaches its lessons constantly rather
than three hours a week. ' -

But it is the knowledge thatyou receive in the classroom which
enables you to, make the proper evaluation of lessons learned in
life. Formal learning provides you with a scorecard for appre-
ciation and understanding. _ ' _

My own “graduation” climaxes a period of intense learmng.
—}.Being an educator is very educational. My lessons, of course, have
A not been the classroom sort. My assignments have not been bound
-between hard covers. My grade will not. be submitted _to student
“records.

In my contact with students I hope that the learning expen-
genee has been mutual. That a chancellor can learn from students
_should not be considered unusual. It should be accepted as part of
;the inevitability that we learn from everyone regardless of the
[number of letters behind his name. V

I My lessons for you have not .been scholarly ones. It is not,
‘H in.my opinion, the duty of a chancellor to duplicate the functions
.. ofa, good faculty. But together we have examined the larger is-
sues which confront your govermnent. your organizations and your
_' lives as scholars.

, I have come away from those examinations with a better un-
derstanding of the problems which involve students and of the
students’ concern for the total institution. I hope you ‘have Come
" away with a better understanding of your university and of your
[life. 7
- \ Finally,'then, I wish you the best of luck. And I hope that you
I will use this formal part of your education tovbuild an. educational
« awareness that will remain with you throughout your hfe.

The Pitt News has risen above
s-tudent apathy, above certain
administrative f‘lip service” and
has sought to give the impetus
to a long needed re-evaluation.
The University, under Chancel-
lor Edward H. decided that the
atmosphere in the bookstore
should be an “academic” one. No
one is questioni-ng the fact that
this decision was made or its
reasons for being madeat that
time.
The Freshmen arriving on
campus at orientation for the
first ‘time usually go straight to
the bookstore in an attempt to
get a Pitt Jacket, or maybe just
a Pitt ‘emblem. They are quite
surprised to find these things
unavailable in THEIR Univers-
ity Bookstore. They are even
more confused when to-ld that
these items are sold in stores
in and around the Oakland area
but not on the University cam-
pus. This raises the question:
How can the bookstore best ful-
fill the University community’s
needs‘? Could it be that there
are other articles of inventory
that could be handled in the
bookstore, would sell to the stu-
dents, and also help earn a pro-
fit. The point here is one of em-
phasis. Under Dr. Litchfield it
was “academic.” The University
Community is a community of
\scholars,, administrators and stu-
dents. They all have their needs
I and the University bookstore
should reflect these needs and
desires. There is a need of ﬁne

arts and literary fbooks, classical
records and a ﬁne selection of
paperbacks. But who is the book-
store supposed to be serving?
The public? The City of Pitts-
burgh? or primarily the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Commun-
ity of Scholars, professors, ad-
ministrators and students?
These are questions of emphasis
and purpose. Then there -is the
question of prices. The book-
store allows University em-
ployees ie, professors, adminis-
trators, and janitors a 10 per
cent discount. Why can’t the
students get a discount? or are
we University students consider-
ed like the general public by the
University bookstore?

Dear Mr. Byman:

Whatever shape the new.draft law finally takes, the
fact of military service will continue to be a very real
factor in the career planning of young men-
including all six of you students writing these open
letters with me. This is why I am writing each of you
this same open letter on the subject.

Although this letter will deal primarily with the three
direct questions students have raised with me, the
basic question of a citizen's obligation to his country
underlies my thinking throughout. Here are those
specific issues:

1. Why should a student head for a business career
when graduate study for teaching, for example, will
gain him further deferment-—or when completing
medical school will gain him a commission if and
when he serves? Why shouldn't a student pick the
Peace Corps or VISTA as ”an attractive alternative
to combat?’’ /

2. What chance has a man with a 1-A classification to
get a good job in the first place? Will a company hire
him? .

3. Isn't the time spent in service a worse handicap
for a man planning a career in the competitive world
of business than for his classmate who wants "to be

a doctor or lawyer?

Although thenew draft law may change the rules in
some of these areas, it will not change the fact that
the way a student or a company reacts to the present
situation tells a lot about his or its basic thinking. So
let's consider these issues in order:

‘I. Other careers provide more deferments.

Look closely at this one. Isn't the student who raises
this pointactually saying that he is ready to select his
lifetime occupation solely on the basis of a very
short—term draft preference? Isn't this somewhat like
choosing a college major because its classes are held
in a new building? '

The ISSUE:
 Will  
the dra
hurt
  VQUT    
. business
career?

   

Robert Galvin, Motorla Inc.

The Peace Corps and VISTA don't exempt, by the
way, although they can defer. Sufficient deferments,
it appears, may leave one too old to be drafted.
Whether one avoids the draft by going to Canada
or by going to graduate school with only draft
deferment inmind, it is still draft-dodging. And it
seems that those who would have others fulfill their

own military obligations are often the ones who carp

at ”se|fish” businessmen or vow that business has
questionable ethics.

2. Will acompany hire a man who is 1-A?

Yes. Good men are hard to find these days. A
company who wants a certain man would be very
foolish not tohire him just because he hasn't yet
fulfilled his military obligations. You can probably
find companies which won't hire 1-A's, butwhy look?
There are enough which will. Our own feeling, for
example, is that a man we want now is a man we

will want later as well. We would hope he returns

to Motorola after his service. He will be on military
leave while heis gone;~his time of company service

‘continues; he gets his old job or a comparable one

when he returns. ‘Matter of fact, that's the law.

3. The militaryxdetour hurts a young businessman
most.

Many of our own returned veterans rejoin us in more
responsible positions than they had when they left.
Most of these men have achieved a greater maturity
in the service; they have had to adaptthemselves
readily to changing situations;_ they have lived
through hardships and some have faced personal
danger. They know better who they are and what
they want and why—they know the values of

the things they have fought for. "‘

One important thing to be learned in the service is
how better to cope. A man must cope, in business
and out, all his life long. Additionally, many service-
men received training which is directly applicable to
their/civilian careers. Our own returning servicemen
usually get into the swing of things at a faster pace
than before. They keep this up and most catch up
quite quickly.

As this letter is written, consideration proceeds on
possible revisions of the draft law. The President's
Commission and the House advisory panel agreed

-on two basic questions: that the draft law continues

to be needed, and that younger men should be
drafted first. If I correctly understand large parts of
student opinion, this should be welcomed as
removing many uncertainties in your planning.

No matter what the details of the new draft law may
be, tw.o facts will remain: The government's main
task will be, as always, determining who will serve
when not all serve. Avoiding service through subter-
fuge is a pretty shaky platform upon which to-b_uild
a life.

Do my feelings about our specific commitment in
Viet Nam color my thinking about the draft? I am
the father of mid-teenage sons. I believe we have
an absolute responsibility to resist a communist
take—over of thefree nations of the world whether «
by the use of force from without or subversion
within; this resistance may at times involve us in
military conflict. I also believe an individual who
enjoys and insists upon the inalienable privileges
of a democratic country likewise has an absolute
obligation to protect them; and this obligation may
at times involve him in military service. ’ /

Viewing the events of Saturday and Sunday evenings in retrospect, part members of our apathetic majority and not the small segment of
we cannot condemn the majority of those students who participated in activists on our campus. They identify with one another but not with
the so-called successive riots. Given a situation where students are forced our administrators, Student Organizatiens, and key areas Of e0neern- Cries

If students are effectively incorporated into areas which do affect

they will not be so alienated. Saturday and Sunday evenings should not
be dismissed as just the “academic rites of spring.” To do so is to ignore
all the implications of such an occurrence.

 STUDENTS OBSERVE the “happenings”. in the Quad Sunday night.

by DAVID CORNELIUS

For the ﬁrst time in my life
I was arrested Sunday night. I
spent the night in jail and was
tried in city cou.rt.It was a new
experience but hardly worth the
aggravation, considering I had
no part in the riot.

My roommate and I were re-
turning from West Mifflin at 10
o’clock and parked in front of
the Cathedral of Learning on
Bigelow Blvd. Crossing the
street we were met by two po-
licemen with dogs who demand-
ed that We move on and pre-
vented us from walking onto
University property. Because we
did not move with the haste
they wished, we were arrested.
It wasn't” until we talked to the
‘policeman driving the police
wagon, that We found out what
was happening-. Three other peo-
ple were also put in this Wagon.

All of them were picked off-

the streets; none of whom had
a part in the riots. Later they

even picked up a visiting pro
fessor at Pitt when he Walked
down from Webster Hall.

Because none of us were ac-
tually involved in the riot, the
charges against us were dis-
missed. However, we had to
spend ﬁve hours in jail and pay
a $25 bond to get out. We had
to stay this long because we
were not allowed to make a
phone call until five hours later.
We were cleared though. Others
weren’t so lucky.

By the action of the police
when we were arrested, it seem-
ed that they were much more
panicked than anyone else at the
scene. Their frantic actions and
arrests actually caused more
trouble than easing the situa-
tion.

This point was made evident
when the visiting professor tes-
tifying in behalf of.John Law-
son, Pitt student arrested for
assault and battery, stated that

I’m in no way defending the
riot. It could only be labeled as
irresponsible actions. Yet I can’t
condone the irresponsible ac-
tions of the police either. Maybe
they ‘haven't had enough experi-

_Wh_at was motive for riots? I

by IVAN ABRAMS
The Saturday and Sunday

“Play is an activity which has

Psych Prof Answers:

always the danger that there
will be found people who are
not normal and derive a sense
of ‘satisfaction out of anti-social
action. People suchgas these, he
said, were those most likely re-
sponsible for the throwing of

objects with deliberate aim at
the policemen on the scene.

“In any sort of an emotional-
ly built-up situation, judgment
and common sense are turned
off and there is a tendency to
lose control and react. This is

‘Chain Reaction’

CHARGES WITHDRAWN
Dean of Men Herbert G. Mc-‘j

against them withdrawn. The

Along The Way

SLUSH FOOTBALL.

The violent world of college football has been shaken
during the past month. Shaken in the way that causes
athletic directors across the country to glance nervously
at their staff of coaches and their alumni supporters.

A scandal to a major school has brought to public at-
tention the hypocrisy of collegiate football as an amateur
sport. Just about everybody knows the details of how the
University of Illinois turned itself in on a direct violation
of Big Ten rules prohibiting “slusln" funds for university
athletes. .

Just -about everybody knows that the Big Ten. forced
the resignations of likeable football coach Pete Elliot as
well as basketball coach Harry Combes and his asslstant.

AND JUST about everybody knows that the majority
of Big Ten schools have similar slush funds and engage in
recruiting practices far more unethical than anything the
Illini had done.

“Illinois kept a detailed book on its funds and the dis-
bursements,” is how a spokesmen for the conference ex-
plaints it. “The fund was operated with the knowledge of
the coaches, who knew it was against the rules. The evi-
dence against others is not always concrete.”

Former Illinois Athletic Director Doug Mills is among
many who have criticized the punishment, which also in-
cludes thepermanent suspension of ﬁve athletes. “This is
just peanuts compared to what others are doing,” he says.

SEVEN YEARS ago, Mills called Pitt Athletic Director
Frank’ Carver to schedule the two schools for football. The
result of that phone call is a clash between Pitt and the
stricken Illini this fall on September 30, the second game
of the season for the Panthers.

“It’s anybody’s guess what the effect of this mess is
going to be,” Carver said. “The strict action might make
others stop their violations, or it could focus all the wrong-
doing on Illinois, making it safe for the other schools to
continue.” ‘

Carver, who is a recently elected vice-president of the
NCAA, clariﬁed the rule that hung Illinois. “Financial as-
sistance, other than an athletic scholarship covering tuition,
room‘ and board, and a set amount of expense money per
month (usually $15), is illegal.”

IN OTHER WORDS, “If alumni got together to give.

me some money for ballplayers, it would be il1ega,” ex-
plained Carver. “Only the University, through the Student
Aid Office, ‘can administer ﬁnancial assistance to our ath-
letes. We raise the money for them through the Belleﬁeld
Trust fund.”

One of the Illinois football players, whose home was
in Florida, received airplane tickets at vacation times.
Others got expense money, which though allowed by the
NCAA, is forbidden by the Big Ten. Illinois felt that the
slush m0ne.y, which totaled $21,000, was a worthy cause
for needy athletes. The innocent guardians of the Big Ten,
Duffy ‘ Daugherty and Forest Evaschevski, for example,
thought otherwise.

Now the question is, where does Illinois’ go from here?

A week ago, Gene Vance, the school’s new athletic di-
rector, announced the appointment of Jim Valek as head

football coach to replace Elliot and Harv Schmidt as basket-
ball coach to replace Combs.

VALEK assumes control of the _Illini gridders just in
time for spring practice. Perhaps his appointment, coming

"only days after Elliot submitted his resignation, will mean

a smooth transition on the football ﬁeld.

Panther coach Dave Hart has adopted a “we’ll wait
and see” attitude. Carver speculated that the scandal and

_ the suspensions could “have a serious downward effect on

the teaIn’s morale.” On the other hand, “We could be fac-
ing a ﬁred up bunch of kids next fall.

“Ordinarily,” he continued, “Big Ten schools ease up
onnon-conference opponents. But with the national atten-
tion on them, Illinois may take every game as a “must” win.

IT’S A CERTAINTY that the Illinois game has taken
on added interest. But the Panthers also have _Wisconsin
on their schedule. Two Big Ten teams. Two weeks apart.
Will Elliot blow the lid off the whole conference as he swore
he would? I

- He may yet. But in any case, Pitt’s clean. Probably too.
clean to suit Hart though. -

Battle hardened veterans
face a showdown with the
Panthers’ highly touted
sophomore crop in the an-
nual Blue-Gold spring game Sat-
urday at 2 p.m. at the Stadium.

Some of the veterans, secure
in ﬁrst string berths, must show
that's where they belong. But
other veterans must prove they
are ﬁrst team material.

Head coach Dave Hart and
his staff have sized up each in-
dividual, sophomore or returnee.
And in Saturday's game, the
coaches plan to match both the
offensive and defensive ﬁrst
teams, the Blue team—against
the remainder of the squad—the
Gold team.

Presently, eight sophomores
have taken over Blue team posi-
tions, six offensively and two
defensively. But stalwart veter-
ans remain the mainstays on
defense, if not so offensively.

Greg Keller, an adequate de-
fensive end last season, has
proved just the right man for
the Panthers’ vital middle guard
position. That is the spot va-
cated by All-East middle line
backer Jim Flanigan, who sign-
ed a professional contract with
the Green Bay Packers. '

Keller’s 6-3, 220 frame can ei-
ther anchor the forward wall in

‘Hart's 5-4 defense. Or, he can

supplement the linebackers in a
4-4-3 formation.

“Keller is not only big, he’s
agile,” emphasized Hart. “He's
doing well as linebacker because
he’s got a good deal of killer
instinct.

“There is no reason, this de-

fensive team can't be one of the

me».

MIKE ELLIOT came up from his post in the defensive backﬁeld

to breakup a pass play. The former quarterback has been impres-

sive in making the switch from offense to defense.

best,” acclaimed Hart, “And Kel-
ler will be one of its mainstays.”

That "defense across the line
shows 6-2, 212 end Bob Ellis;
6-4, 205 tackle Mike Mancuso
(Dave Drake, ﬁrst string tackle
injured his ankle and will miss
the remainder of drills); Keller,
then 6-4, 230 tackle Ed Whit-
taker; and 6-5, 225 end Paul
Naponick.

“Drake’s absence really hurts
you,” noted Hart. “IIe’s another
mainstay. Whittaker has done a
ﬁne job since switching to de-
fense.” '

“Joe doesn't cover too well on

Offensively, Hart will stick to
his ball control philosophy to
‘Yin “The guys this year be-
lleve they can move that ball.
Y0u’Ve just got to push that
ball forward. and maintain pos-

The Panthers’ rushing attack
last season was more of a handi.
cap than anything else. “You
can't give up the ball to Syra-
cuse or Notre Dame on fumbles
and missed short yardage situa-
tions and expect to win,” assert-
ed Hart.

“It’s important to maintain
possession of the ball because

An administrative foulup
forced the cancellation of
yesterday’s baseball game
with St. Francis and put a
crimp in coach Bobby Lewis’
plans for his pitching rotation.

Lewis had planned to have
Dave Welty and Don Stock split
the mound chores against St.
Francis, thus giving each of
them a chance to get in some

‘ work before the weekend games.

But, the cancellation changed
all that. Now Welty is being
counted on to go nine on Friday
against Washington an.d Jeffer-
son, and Stock is expected to do
the same Saturday against Buck-
nell. Both games will be played
at Leach Farm Field.

“I hope they're ready,” com-
mented Lewis. “I think they will
be, but if not, .we have help.”
The help will be limited how-
ever, to Gary Laidig and ‘Rich

Orpneck, since Lewis’ other two.

pitchers, Bill Trees and Denny

rough the first time. I'd prob-
ably be better going five, but
that’s the way it is.”

The players were all disap-
pointed at the cancellation, and
Lewis shared their view. “I’m
very disappointed. I really be-
lieve we were ready. But, there's
nothing we can do.”

The circumstances surounding
the postponement contributed to
the general disappointment-
Lewis had been told that the
field would be ready, but then
was informed, Monday morning
by Assistant Athletic Director
Walt Cummins, that the game
had been cancelled.

Some of the players who had
seen the field insisted that it
was in playable condition, but
as Lewis said, “It’s their field
and we’ll have ‘ to take their
word for it.” '

Adding to Lewis’ troubles is
the fact that second ~ baseman
Steve Kienzl will be out for two
weeks with an ankle he injured
in Monday’s practice, a practice
that would not have been held
had the game not been cancelled.

The gro-undskeepers ins i s t
that Leach Fann will be ready
for the Friday and Saturday
games “as long as it doesn't
rain.” But then that’s what they
said about yesterday.

W. irginia Clubs Golf Team, 19-5, I 

For Golfers Second Straight Loss

The golfers are in the
rough. An 0-2 record, the
latest loss tacked on by West
Virginia, 19-5, in Monday's
match,and a good chance to
equal last season’s dismal 3-14
ledger are -keeping them in it.

Right now the only‘ thing
which could bring them out of
it is Pete Keller, a sophomore
from Mt. Lebanon.

Keller,‘ a University of Vir-
ginia transfer student, becomes
technically eligible to play when
the golf team again resumes

play against George Washington .

and Georgetown, April 20 and
21. -
He sat out one year of com-

petition because of the transfer-’

eligibility clause under NCAA

regulations. .
Keller may be what the team

needs. “I think so, at least his
scores indicate this,” explained
coach Rex Peery. But let’s wait
and .see before you compare him
with the present squad.”

Peery recognized that the
Colonials and the Hoyas, which
the golfers wil face have some
“mighty fine golfers,” but so
did the Mountaineers. .

At Morgantown, the match
was based on a three points per
18 holes instead of the Eastern
one point system.

Rick Golden, shooting a 77,
broke even with,WVU’s Ron

Mallicone, at one and ‘a-half
points each in the number five
. .slot.

Medalist Bob Alult, with a low
score of 73 for WVU, upended

Bill Bryan, 3-0. Ault finished 

one-up on the first nine; and
four-up on the back nine.

In the number one match, the ‘ 
golfers’ Dick Winters exploded g,;7;:,‘"

to an 81 and lost five-up to the
Mountaineers’ Steve Haque, who
picked up three team points.
Shooting a 76, Haque was four-
up, then one-up on the back nine.

All-East linebacker and
now protegy to Vince Lom-
bardi’s Green Bay Packers
football team, Jim Flanigan
almost walked away with all the
honors at the Athletic Awards
Banquet yesterday in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom.

Flanigan didn’t quite, however,
because he wasn’t there to re-
ceive the Pitt News Athlete of
the Year Award or the most
valuable player award for the
1966 Panthers. ,

The Pitt News award annual-
ly recognizes an outstanding
senior who most distinguished
himself On the ﬁeld. In ﬁve of
the last six years, the awardee
has’ been a football player.

The present Commission of
the Southern. Conference and
former Pitt great-, Lloyd Jordan,
was the banquet’s main speaker.

Jordan, a native of Punxsu-
tawney, Pa., was a three year
letterman in football and _bas-
ketball from 1921-23. After serv-
ing as a high school and college
football coach, he has been the
Southern Conference commis-
sioner for the last seven years.

 

The banquet itself is held to
honor athletes of the past calen-
dar year, Besides honoring the
most valuable athlete in each
sport, Dean of Engineering Wal-
ter Turkes presented the Ath-
letic Committee Award. ‘It is
given to a senior who has main-
tained the best com-bination of
high scholarship, all around atht
letic ability, sportsmanship, and

aptitude.

ted As “Athlete or The Year”  

Dick Hulme, a three year let-
ter winner in swimming, was
the recipient of this year’s award.
Hulme owns a 3.68 QPA in elec-
trical engineering‘.

Besides the Panthers’. F’lani-
gan, Frank Handleman in cross-
country and Art Richardson in

soccer, were the other fall sports

awardees. ~

Netmen Belted by W. Virginia, 8-1

by JERRY GRUEBEL
Coach Ben Pope had ex-
pected his tennis team to
meet a strong West Virginia
squad. He wasn’t wrong
about that. But West‘ Virginia
just proved too strong as they

outclassed the netmen, 8-1.
“The boys played Well,” Po-pe
sympathized, “but West Virginia

. played m-uch better. These fellas

were much steadier.”
Most of the matches weren’t
even close. In the singles, Erik

Lieberman was the only one of '

Pope’s players to win. He beat
Jack Ehrheart 6-3 and 6-0.
Bill Goldstein and Robert Kell-

“man were the only netters who

came close to winning. Goldstein
lost to WVU’s third man, Mark
Parsons, 6-4, 6-8, and 6-3. Kell-
man lost to W.C. Boyd 6-4, 3-6,
and 6-3.

In the other singles matches,
Torn Hanna, the top man of the
West Virginia team, beat Bill
Nichols 6-3 and 6-2; Bob Pruett
whipped Bob Salembier 6-1 and
6-4; and Joe Abraham beat Mar-
ty Liebowitz 6-4 twice.

The netmen were shut out in
the doubles. Parsons and Pruett
outmatched Nichols anl Liebo-
witz 6-3 and 6-2. In the next
pair-up, Abraham and Hanna de-
feated Goldstein and Lieberman
6-1 and 7-5. Erheart and Jeff
Jones had no trouble with Sa-
lembier and Elliot Sainer 6-3
and 6-3. .

Pope still has hopes for his
team. “They fought hard,” he
said referring to his boys, “but
they were just outplayed.”

He later added, “the boys took
the loss well. They won't give

against Bucknell when they
open the home season.

Coach Ben Pope expects Buck-
nell to be tough. “They have 21

tennis -courts on campus and’

these are always in constant use.
There are so many players to
pick from. They must have a lot
of talent—a great team,” Pope
frowns. I

The coach will probably use
the same line-up against Buck-
nell. The matches will be played
at Carnegie Tech’s courts be-
cause the state still hasn’t given
the team permission to play on

6 REQUIEMRFOR A SQUARE

You, like any other lovable, clean-living, freckle-faced
American kid, want to be a BMOC. How can you make-it?

Well sir, there are several ways, none of which will I

work.

You’re too puny to be an athlete, too lazy to be a Valedic-
torian, and too hairy to run for Homecoming Queen. ,

As for becoming a best-dressed man, how are you going
to buy clothes with a’ miser for a father?

Are you licked then? Is there no way to make BMOC?

Yes, there is! And you can do it! Do what? This:

Become a hippie! Get cool! Get alienated! Have an
Identity Crisis! Be one of the Others!

How? Well sir, to become a" hippie, simply follow these
ﬁve simple rules:

1. Read all of Tolkien in the original dwarf.

2. Have your Sophomore Slump in the freshman year.

3. Wear buttons that say things like this:

‘ NATIONALIZE DAIRY QUEEN
ASTHMATICS, UNITE
‘ LEGALIZE APPLE BUTTER
HANDS OFF AIR POLLUTION

4. Go steady with a girl who has long greasy hair, a gui-
tar, enlarged pores, and thermal underwear.

5. Attend Happenings regularly.

‘L. e L
I‘ :y ,//1”%?‘\.
;; r it: p .

 

This last item may require some explanation, for it is"
possible that Happenings haven’t reached your campus
yet. Be assured they will because Happenings are the big-
gest college craze since mononucleosis.

A Happening, in case you don’t know, is the ﬁrst form- "

less art form. Things just happen. For example, eighty
naked men come out and squirt each other with ﬁre hoses
containing tinted yogurt. Then eighty more naked men
come out and light ‘birthday candles in the navels of the
ﬁrst eighty men. Then one girl, clothed, comes out and

pulls three thousand feet of sausage casing through her

pierced ear. Then eighty more naked men come out and
eat a station wagon.

There is, of course, a musical accompaniment to all
these fun things. Usually it is “Begin the Beguinej’ played
by 26 trench mortars, _a drop forge, and a rooster.

There used to be, some years ago,-still another require-
ment forbecoming a hippie: a man had to have a beard.

But no longer. Beards were worn in the past not so
much as a protest, but because shaving was such a painful

experience. Then along came Personna Super Stainless -

Steel Blades.

Today if you don’t want to shave, well, that’s your
hangup, isn’t it, baby? I mean when you've got a blade
like Personna that tugs not neither does it scrape, what’s
your copout, man? I mean like get with it; you’re living
in the past. Shaving used to hurt, used to scratch, used to
gouge, used to give you all kinds of static. But not since
Personna. It’s a gas, man. It’s a doozy; it’s mom’s apple
pie. You dig? -

I mean, man, you still want a beard? Crazy! But you
don’t have to turn your face into a slum, do you? Shave
around the bush, baby, neatly and nicely with Personna.
I mean like Personna comes in double-edge style and
Injector style too. I mean like any way you try it, you
gotta like like it.

**-I-

Hey, man, like how about doubling your shaving cool?
Like how about wilting those crazy whiskers with some

Burma-Shave? Like regular or menthol? Like have "

you got a better friend than your kisser? Like treat it
