By BERNIE TRUMPOWER

Richard Hodges, director of
the Office of Student Records,
has released figures for fall
registration showing that en-
rollment has reached 4,970. In
releasing the statistics, Hodges
stated. “We are in slightly better
condition for this fall registration
at this

than we were last year

time.“

Hodges referred to the last min-
ute rush for schedule changes in
the Commons Room by saying. “If
students are going to change a
course. they should do it now and
avoid the Commons Room dilem-
ma." By having students change
their courses as early as possible
liodges hopes to eliminate some of
the last minute confusion in the
Otlice of Student Records itself.

At present the statistics for the
following schools stand as follows:
Liberal Arts, 2.210; Education,
329; Engineering and Mines, 1,282;
Nursing, 155; Business. 205; Phar-
macy. 89; General Studies, 60.
Hodges stated, “Registration is
not. however. complete in this
area due to incoming freshmen
who have not completed their
registration.

Release Statistics

He went on to release statistics
on registration for the graduate
schools but noted that in this area
the figures are about 50 per cent
of the expected total. In the Grad-
uate School of the Humanities, 88;
Social Sciences, 27; Natural Sci-
ences. 66: Education, 156; Engi-
neering and Mines, 207; Phar-
macy, 10: Dentistry: 22; Nursing,
26; Business, 39; and Health Sci-
ences, 4.

In addition to new freshmen,
those students planning to enroll
in the School of Education will
not complete their registration
until the termination of the
spring trimester. Schools such as
those of Nursing and Pharmacy
have received approximately~«com-
plete enrollment for their fall

classes.

WANTS DOUBLE STANDARDS

One Pitt coach, tired of losing, both in the games and
in the recruiting battle, is fed—up with the situation here.
“I’m for having double standards,” he cried, “so we can com-

\ pete with these other schools we’re playing.

“If they (the administration) had given me a little
more leeway,” he added, “I could’ve brought in a few
more kids. This is nonsense when we’re playing schools

like Syracuse, West Virginia and Miami that have double
. standards. At least Notre Dame is coming up now.”

Despite the schedule ripped off, the coach was not a

football man.

Pitt's football team has gotten rid of more dead wood in
key places this year than an expert termite exterminator.
This year the dead wood is where it belongs-——on the bench.
That’s why the outlook is good for this fall.

While in New York a friend of Beano’s told him: “I saw

it was one of your dates.” Beano admitted that he has dated
a few dogs in his life, but none with four legs.

After sipping a tasteless coke at Forbes Field the other
night I dread the thought of having to pay Concessionaire

Myron Obrisky‘s water bill.

Basketball star Brian Generalovich was . released
from his job as bus boy in a resort in the Catskill Moun-

tains just prior to the start of the summer basketball

camp up there. He hasn’t been paid either, according to

roommate Neil Shorthouse.

Just when it appeared that baseball was on the up-
swing here after the recent successful season, Coach Bob
Lewis reports that he has no aid to give to any incoming
freshmen this fall. Looks like another recession soon. “But I
have no grudge,” Lewis said. “This is the way it has to be."

like Grandma Used to Malia

Last year Pitt's football team had a rocking chair of-
fense: You had the impression that it was moving but it was

getting nowhere.

If you wonder why Pitt has so many football players
from Youngstown, look at it this way. If you ‘lived in a town
.. where priests sleep with pistols under their pillows and guys
are found in the trunks of autos, wouldn’t you want to

leave town, too?

Carnegie Tech is going rough housing again. They now
have a cricket team. And that’s a wicket_sport. _ _
If Jerry Lucas accomplished one important thing in
his life it was getting rid of the American Basketball

League.

After seeing that Beano Cook got an invitation, there's
one thing that puzzles me. How come I wasn t invited to Mike

Rice’s wedding reception?

Duquesne University reportedly has only given out three
basketball scholarships for the coming year. They are having
trouble with the admissions director who apparently is not
a basketball fan. Pitt has only two in the basket at this

point.

. Could there be a merger in the wings?

The Chemical Engineers and the

: to dominate play in the American

Young homering twice and Ash

“full many a flower is born to blush unseen, and waste its.

sweetness on the desert air.”

Panther basketball coach Bob Timmons, however, is not

skipping any flowers in his search
for prospects due to enter in the
fall.

He has corraled two so far and
is still skipping after more. The
one, Larry Szykowney, attended
near-by North Catholic High
School, whose basketball team
holds the Pennsylvania Catholic

high school team title. Timmons
rates Szykowney as “a good back-
court man, a good playmaker, and,
in full, a fine all-around player.”

Recruits New Yorker

The other, Bob Lovett, from New
York, will add six feet and six
inches of height to the freshman
team. Lovett’s high school team
advanced to their district finals
in play last season. According to
Timmons, Lovett excels in offen-
sive play.

A third player, Dave Roman,
will come to the University in
the fall as a team member ell-
gible for varsity competition.
Roman played freshman ball at
Johnstown Center. Against the
Panther Jayvees, he poured on
a rather convincing 30-point
barrage.

Timmons rates Roman as “a
good scoring backcourt man,
whom he hopes to pair up with
Ca] Sheffield.” _

Timmons regretfully added that
“the Panthers last year lacked the
back-court shooting which Roman,
hopefully, can offer.”

!Ricuitti Named
'To All-Star Team

Pitt Shortstop Al Ricuitti was
‘recently named to the second
iteam District 2 All-Star team.

Ricuitti, who batted .392 for
the year, was runner-up to Den-
ny Moyer of Lafayette who hit
.420 and was a repeater on the
select squad.

Coach Bobby Lewis has no
complaints despite his pitch for
Ricuitti. He never saw Moyer
play, but other Eastern coaches
attested to the boy’s outstanding
ability.

Lewis said the statistics of
both Moyer and Ricuittl were

pretty close with Al having ﬁve
homers to Moyer’s three. He
added that Moyer committed
seven errors whereas his man
had only one miscue.

District 2 of the NCAA com-
prises New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Delaware.

Bob “Corky” Cuthbert was
named to the honorable mention
listing as a right fielder.

_W. Va., State,
Syracuse Hated

When the second half of
August rolls around, the Pan-
ther football team, will head
for its fall training camp at
Allegheny College in Mead-
ville. Training starts on Au-
gust 21.

If the football team voted on
the three games it would want to
win the most in 1962, it probably
would be a three-way tie among
West Virginia, Penn State, and
Syracuse. All three routed the
Panthers in 1961.

“I want to beat Syracuse the
most,” said tackle Gary Kalten-
bach.

Brown Picks PSU
“Penn State for me," said guard
Tom Brown, a senior.‘
“West Virginia for me,” said
fullback Rick Leeson.
Actually the reasons are dif-
ferent for everybody. As for the

coaches. they are evenly divided
too.

Before last year’s West Vir-
ginia game, a Pitt player made a
bad comment about the Moun-
taineer squad. This quote ap-
peared in The Pitt News.

Showed Poor Taste

“Although it did not have any-
thing to do with the outcome, it
was still in bad taste for one of
the Pitt players to say it,” said
Beano Cook, Pitt publicity direc-
tor.

However, after the game, the
Mountaineer players had a few
things to say about Pitt. “Na
desire. Lazy. No second effort,”
were just some of the quotes
told to writers.

i Then there is Syracuse. The
;Pitt team had a hard time at-
;tempting to stop halfback Ernie
3Davis. In fact, the Heisman award
‘winner had a field day against
;the Panthers. Yet, the following
lweek, a Syracuse coach said Pitt
played it a little rough on Davis.

Low Passing Quota
As for Penn State, a certain
school official made fun of Pitt’s
‘passing attack a few days after
;the game. “Pitt's quota for passing
is usually one a game,” he wrote.
Many players still like to beat
Notre Dame but there is no
bitterness among members of
the squad.

“Notre Dame plays the best in
the country,” said one player.
“They never cry when they lose.
They hit harder than any team
we played last year but were the
cleanest team. As for myself, I
like to see them win every game
except against us.”

Other opponents on the 1962
schedule are Miami of Florida,
Baylor, California, UCLA, Navy,
and Army.

Profesor Gets
$400 to Study

Formations

Dr. George DeVries Kein, as-
sistant professor of Geology at the
University, recently received an
award of $400 from the Society of

the Sigma Xi and the Scientific.

Research Society of America.

The award will be used by Dr.
Klein to further his studies of
sandstone formations in Oklahoma
and Arkansas.

Dr. Harlow Shapley. chairman
of the Society's grants-in—aid com-
mittee, commented on the presen-
tation, stating that “Each year
Sigma Xi and the Scientific Re-
search Society make a number of
grants to the most promising sci-
entists at the critical points of
their research careers.

“We recognize." Shapley con-
tinued, “that many needs are
relatively too small for the large
foundations to consider, and it is

. to meet these needs that our re-
search funds are maintained.”

A graduate of Wesleyan Uni-
versity and the University of
Kansas. Klein received his doc-
toral degree at Yale in 1960.

Teacher Praises

‘Non ~ Tour Nonsense’
Editor, The Pitt News:

I want to thank Mr. Nesvisky
for his most enlightening, eye-
opening tour reports of the So-

viet Union. also USSR. also Rus-
sia which appeared in the June

27 Pitt News. His highly infor-
mative article inspires every
reader who has not been there

to catch the next troika to Mos-
cow and reminds those of us
who have already been there
how nice it is over here in Pitts-
burgh.

Color Idea

Editor. The Pitt News.‘

Hark, do I hear the strains of
bitterness coming from J. Bar-
rie’s letter of June 2? concern-
ing the various ID color tags‘?
Surely he must be kidding! I can
not see a better way to famil-
iarize oneself with the freshman
women when they come here.
You not only have the advan-
tage of knowing her name but
also whether she be a dorm stu-
dent or not.

If she is from Aardvark Park,
New York, for example. I rather
doubt whether she has seriously
considered the possibilities of be-
coming a full-fledged commuter.
In the past, these people have
tended to shy away from this
sort of evil.

I think it would be a peach of
an idea if everyone had an ID
color tag with his or her name
on it whichever the case may
be. The color background could

Tag

indicate one’s major field-—some

examples if you please--a blue
hue for the chem majors; blue
to remind everyone that it's not
brains that gets one through
chemistry but sheer guts and
courage and the endurance of
lab fatigue. A light yellow hue
here for the English majors to
signify—-, well one tends to get
the picture, doesn't one?

And if J. B. thinks that all
these colors are confusing and
that he needs a key for them,
let him read it in the Pitt News.

Wouldn’t it be nice if the edi-

, tors of the Pitt News would print

in each edition what all ..the col-
ors stand for? It would make
better reading, than an of last

year's public relations news re-
leases which they have been stuf-
fing in one of “America's great
newspapers", or is that the Pitts-
burgh Press‘s motto‘?

One parting though-wouldn't
it be nice if the Pitt News would
give out an ID tag when they
print one of your letters in the
Pitt News? Yes sir, it is a peach
of an idea.

Tech Student Replies

‘To Beat It, Bucs'
Editor. The Pitt News:

Upon reading your article,
“Beat it, Bucs." I immediately

disagree with you violently. I
have been in Oakland since Sep-
tember 1959 as a student at Car-
negle Tech. Yes. the fans even
come as far as Tech to park. But,
did you ever stop to think that
the same influx happens for Pitt
football games? You say the
games pose a parking problem for
Pitt students. I have no parking
problems; I have no car. I must
rely on public transportation.

Have you thought of the eco-
nomic impact of baseball on the
community? I'm sure many Oak-
landers will be sorry to see the
Pirates move to the North Side.
There are hundreds who obtain
a few extra dollars, if not all
of their income, from baseball,
both inside the park and out. This
money will change hands many
times right in Oakland. further
promoting the economy.

Most Pittsburghers and even
Western Pennsylvanians w e r e
exuberant when the Pirates won
the World Series in ’60. For
many restaurants. hotel and park-
ing lot operators the Series meant
thousands of dollars.

You evidently don‘t care for
baseball. It is the national past-
time. President Kennedy threw
out the first ball and enjoyed the
All Star game immensely this
week. In these times of tension
baseball is an excellent form of
relaxation.

You seem proud that Pitt has

ll lxllll

driven the Bucs out. of Oakland.
Did you know that many Oak-
landcrs regard Pitt as a spread-
ing plague devouring everything
in its path’? I do not share this
opinion, because of Pitt's intel-
lectual purpose. I am glad to see
slums and antiquated building go
in the face of progress.

But my ire was raised. along
with that of other Pittsburghers
when we heard that Pitt was
going to chop a few acres out
of Schenley Park for a Fine Arts
building. I hope it is not the
land occupied by the playground
and beautiful fountain behind
Forbes
your sacred parking lot.

People To Decide

Columnists Fate

Editor, The Pitt News.‘

The person who wx'ole “Beat
it, Bucs" seems to be asking for
a reply. He doesn‘t seen to be
writing in a comic or
manner. It sounds
and
baseball. Does he know the posi-
tions of the nine men or has he
ever felt the excitement of the
game?

All the criticism he has about
parking, the fans, the announcers,
etc. are all part of making the
game a pastime of the American
public. Even the President of the
United States has time to sit in
on an All-Star game. I will let
the American public who have
sung “Take me out to the Ball
Game" for many years decide
whether the author’s criticism is
valid.
