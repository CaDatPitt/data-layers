Trustees approve new graduate programs

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

University of Pittsburgh graduate schools
are expanding as the result of the board of
trustees’ approval Thursday of three new
graduate academic programs.

Students will now have the option of
obtaining a Ph.D. in Rehabilitation Science in
the School of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences, as well as a Master of Law degree in
International and Comparative Law and a
Master of Health Promotion and Education.

The Ph.D. program inRehabilitation
Science will be offered through the School of
Health and Rehabilitation Science and will

rely on faculty from the Schools of Medicine
and Engineering and the Department of
Occupational Therapy, Rehabilitation Science
and Technology and Physical Therapy.

“The proposal has been through —— as are
all academic proposals — a very, very lengthy
and close scrutiny at various levels inside the
university before coming to our committee,”
said Martha Munsch, a representative of the
Academic Affairs/Libraries Committee.

In a letter to the chancellor from Provost
James Maher, Maher said Dean Clifford
Brubaker of the School of Health and
Rehabilitation, “views the launching of a doc-
toral program as the last major element in the
transformation of the school from a training

program to a comprehensive academic and
scholarly enterprise.” ’

In reference to the the Master of Law ‘

degree, a press release was issued on
Thursday. In it, Pitt Director of
Communications Ken Service said, “The
Master of Law degree in International and
Comparative Law is designed for graduates of
foreign law schools who wish to expandtheir
understanding of the U.S. legal system. The
program will also helpeducate U.S. students
about other legal systems through classroom
interaction with the foreign participants.”

As for the Master of Health Promotion and
Education, it will be offered by the School of

C WO prepares for Take Backfire Night

This year CWO hopes to get everyone
involved in the march, including fraternities and

“Every year. 132,000 women report they have
been victims of rape or attempted rape,” said
Stephanie Sudzina, co-president of Campus
Women’s Organization, at Thursday’s meeting.

The statistics she read were from an FBI sur-
vey, and those are the kinds of statistics that are
going to be the centerpiece for the annual “Take
Back the Night” march on April 5. The march is
coordinated by CWO and at their meeting it was

the main topic of discussion.

“The march is against sexual assault,” said
Scott Dolin, co-president of CWO. “Last year
there were 300 people, and we would stop where
the speakers and people could walk up and talk
about personal stories involving sexual assault

and rape.”

CHINA — The United States
and China are making progress
toward an agreement regarding
several issues, including the
intellectual property piracy issue
that has been the cause of ten-
sion in recent weeks.

Both groups are scheduled to
attend higher-level meetings this
week to try and iron out their
disagreements, although U.S.
officials say that other important
issues are still outstanding.

The talks are scheduled to be
held in China, and Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene
Bashefsky will lead the talks. —

SARAJEVO — The Bosnia
truce is showing signs of strain
as Bosnian government sources
and Muslims fired at each other
and fought on the ground for the
last three days.

Both Bosnian Serbs and Croat
commanders refused to attend
peace talks that had been sched-
uled by United Nations officials.

Sporadic fighting occurred
near the town of Bihac. The
cease-ﬁre that was reached on
Jan. 1 was designed to last four
months to give the two sides a
chance to reach an agreement.

LEBANON — Fighting
occurred in southern Israel as
planes and guns pounded the
guenilla-held area. Two civilians

were killed, including a 15-year-
old girl.

One guerrilla was wounded in
the attack which was the sixth so
far this year.

United Nation officials said
Israeli and South Lebanon Anny
gunners released some 400
heavy artillery shells on the area.

Guerrillas fired back with anti-
tank rockets and machine guns.

NEW HAMPSHIRE — The
Republican Party is gearing up
early for the 1996 elections. This
weekend, nine Republican hope-
fuls descended on New
Hampshire to speak to 1,400
activists.

Some of the potential candi-
dates who showed up included
Bob Dole, who at 71 is going to
run for the third time, and Texas
Senator Phil Gramm, who is
expected to be the ﬁrst person to
announce his candidacy next
week.

New Hampshire is regarded as
being an important litmus test of
an candidate, because it is con-
sidered the first real test for a
candidate. Candidates who have
won the New Hampshire prima-
ry since 1948, with only one
exception, have gone on to win
the party’s presidential nomina-
tion. — Reuters

NEW YORK — The National

time chairman William Gibson.
The 64—member board voted 30
for Evers-Williams and 29 for

MIAMI — The Clinton admin-
istration agreed Sunday to let
Cuban families visit relatives
detained in the U.S. naval base
at Guantanamo Bay,’ Cuba.

The base currently has 25,000
refugees, and the Clinton admin-
istration is still trying to decide
whether to grant asylums to
refugees who set sail to the
United States before the Aug. 19
decision to refuse entry to Cuban
rafters.

‘Many of the refugees are dis-
appointed with the turn of
events, and some have attempted
suicide or have walked and
swam back to their communist-
held homeland.

The visits by family members
to the naval base could start as
soon as March, and the
Pentagon announced that it
would spend $35 million to
upgrade the refugee camp. —

an anti-Mitsubishi stance along
with chants such as “Hey, hey, ho,
ho. Mitsubishi has got to go” and
“Mitsubishi Corporation — We
don’t need your deforestation” to
get their message across.

The group performed a skit
depicting the end of the world and
the cutting of the last tree by
Mitsubishi. The radiation suit clad
Mitsubishi workers held bloody

chain saws made of cardboard and .

danced around the world’s thre_e
last trees. The skit concluded with
an environmental activist convinc-
ing Mitsubishi to save the last tree

- and become environmentally

aware.

Activists circulated a petition
among pedestrians which called
for a total boycott of Mitsubishi
cars and products.

“We need to send a message to
the destroyers of tropical rain-
forests that such business practices
will not be tolerated,” said Shawn
Maclntyre, vice president of the
Community College of Allegheny
County chapter of SEAC. “We as
consumers cannot continue to
finance the destruction of our
planet by buying Mitsubishi prod-
ucts.”

Pitt’s SEAC chapter was sup-
ported by the Campus Women’s
Organization in the demonstration.

“CWO believes in acting local-
ly,” said CWO co-president
Stephanie Sudzina “It’s about let-
ting your voice be heard. That’s
what we try to do in CWO. We
support being socially active.”
Sudzina encouraged a “girlcot” of

Police patrolled the area of the
protest, but did not attempt to
remove the demonstrators because
they were not doing anything ille-
gal. Police told SEAC that they
had to stop using their loudspeaker
and that they could not block the
sidewalk or the Convention
Center entrance. “You have a

  FALL 1995 MEAL PLAN CHANGES

Dear Resident Student:

Before you renew your housing contract with the University for next year beginning in

August of 1995, we would like to make you aware of significant changes in the Meal Plan.

Beginning with the Fall 1995 Term, there will be one streamlined Meal Plan for A
upperclassmen, and it will cost $750 per term. The Meal Plan will have two parts:

1. Meals. Your choice of a 3-, 5-, or 7-meals-per—week option. Meals may be eaten in
either a residence cafeteria (all—you-can-eat, unlimited trips through the line) or in a retail
outlet (with each meal having a cash equivalency of $4). If you do not eat the number of
meals you contracted for (3/5/7), you will lose them on a weekly basis. Students may use
their dollars to purchase additional meals inthe cafeteria at a discounted price.

2. A Dollar Debit Account*, (or Marriott Money), is the amount of meals for use in either
a cafeteria or retail outlet, operating on a dollar-per-dollar basis. Students have all
semester to use their dollars.

The new Meal Plan may be used in all of the following locations: Lothrop and Sutherland  

residence cafeterias, Schenley Food Court, Eddies’, Clara’s Comer, The Engineer’s
Caboose (Benedum), and The Pitt Club (January through May, for White Linen dinners
only).

The Choice Dollars program will remain as a voluntary meal supplement. 5

As you can see in the following chart, the new $750 Meal Plan for the Oakland Campus
compares favorably with the meal plans available at Pitt’s regional campuses:

BRADFORD S 15—Mea1 P1an...$940
l9—Meal Plan...$98O

JOHNSTOWN 14-Meal Plan...$792 P
l9—Meal Plan...$827

GREEN SBURG 10-Meal Plan...$835
5 l9-Meal Plan...$88O

TITUSVILLE V l9—Meal Plan...$96O

We are confident that you will find the new Meal Plan both ﬂexible and easy_ to use. No
restrictions or limitations will be imposed on the use of dollars for the Dollar Debit
Account*.

*The Dollar Debit Account is part of the required Meal Plan, and should not be, confused
with Choice Dollars, which is a separate, ‘voluntary program. 5 C

News is not exploitation

The purpose of a newspaper is to make its readers
aware of what is happening in their communities and in
the world. It would be a disservice to those the paper
serves to sugarcoat bad news in an effort to make the
world appear better than it is and thus to give them-a
false sense of security. By knowing the truth about the
world around them, the readers of the newspaper are bet-
ter equipped to deal with it. V

When The Pitt News printed the article reporting a sex-
ual assault on Feb. 14, 1995, the purpose was to make
the students of this campus aware of a situation, albeit
unpleasant, that affects them. Students need to be aware
of what’ happens to the members of their community.

The details of the assault were printed to help educate
the campus about the nature of sexual assault. Students
need to be aware thatvsexual assault involves more than

‘just the standard definition of rape. The entire campus

community needs to be aware of what happens in order
to protect themselves from these unfortunate circum-
stances.

As for whether or not a “tremendous disservice” was
done to the victims of sexual assault, only the victims
themselves can know that. As for “potential victims,”
that is exactly what printing this article is designed to
prevent. To think of the campus as full of “potential vic-
tims” is a terrible approach to the problem. Students who

are aware of the fact that sexual assault exists and know —

the circumstances are less likely to become victims of
the assault. .

It was for this reason that The Pitt News printed Public
Safety’s remarks that-the victim was “intoxicated” and
had left “an Oakland bar with a man she had just met.”
Far from victim—blaming statements, these are the
circumstances under which the Department of
Public Safety said the assault took place. To suggest
that reporting the facts is “victim-blaming” is a com-
plete disregard for the circumstances and context of the
report. People must know what led up to this sort of inci-
dent so that they may prevent a problem before it

OCCl.lI'S.

This unfortunate assault needs to be brought to light in
order to prevent further incidents of this kind. Preventing
further victims, not exploiting them, was the purpose of
this report. Also, with the printing of this article, it was
hoped that anyone with information might come forward
to help resolve this situation. This crime, like any other,
must be reported.

victim exploited

I am writing this letter to
draw your attention to the
recent article entitled
“Assault Allegations
Reported,” which was printed
in The Pitt News, front page,
on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 1995. I
believe that you need to
understand the consequences
of your decision to graphical-
ly detail the alleged assault
itself and then print these
details on the front page of
The Pitt News. In addition,
the societal propensity to
blame the victim was also
quite evident in the article
and the consequences of that
will also be addressed in this
letter. I am hoping that, in the
future, you will avoid totally
disregarding and exploiting
the trauma that another
human being has experi-
enced.

Due to Mark Gordon’s arti-
cle, the victim now lives in
fear that the alleged assailant
and/or his friends will begin
to harass or intimidate her or
even possibly stalk her. The
alleged assailant will now
know that the victim has
reported the assault to the
police. Consequently, the vic-
tim is terrified of being alone
on campus because of the
fear of seeing the assailant or
any of his friends.

Your decision to print this
article only enhanced the
shame, humiliation, and
ernbarrassment that the vic-
tim already feels. The entire
university community now
knows all the graphic details
of the assault.

You printed this article with
total disregard for the victim.
You have greatly contributed
to her feeling of powerless-
ness which she experienced
the night of the assault. You
have also created a situation

in which it will be extremely

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

difficult forthe victimto trust
anyone who is in a positionat
the university to help her.

You have done a tremen-
dous disservice to all the vic-
tim and potential victims on
campus. Victims will now be
extremely reluctant to report
their assaults to the
Department of Public Safety
or any university employee,
for that matter. The victim of
this recent assault of this
recent assault informed me
that she would not have spo-
ken to Public Safety if she
had known that The Pitt News
would exploit her.

Within the article, you
referred to the victim as
“intoxicated” and as “leaving
an Oakland bar with a man
she had just met”. I have
received phone calls from
students who are horrified
and angry by your victim-
blaming statements and your
propensity to degrade an
already degraded and objecti-
fied human being.

In closing, I sincerely hope
that The Pitt News’ staff
members will reevaluate their
values and motives and begin
to treat other individuals with
dignity and respect. It will
take a long time to undo the
damage that you have creat-
ed.

Charges unfounded

We have read an article

appeared in the Jan. 30, 1995
issue of The Pitt News. She

offered no evidence to sup-
port her accusations.

Africana Studies is a teach:
ing, research and public ser-

vice department just like any
other academic department in
FAS. Our courses prepare
students for graduate and pro-
fessional schools as well as
for work. Our courses are
open to all students, and in
fact a good number of white

Africana Studies. We are an _

area -studies department with
a focus on the teaching and
research of the black experi-

this respect our regional
emphasis is much like that of
other university units such as

We are not any different from
other Pitt departments that
specialize in the study of par-

Streaky
Thomas
deserves
more time

, t the
Columnist end of
18165 high school

career, he was

rated one of the top 10 college
prospects in his home state of a
Texas and one of the top 200 in
the country. He also earned
McDonald’s All—America hon-
ors and was a member of the
USA Today All—Star team. He
even displayed his explosive
athletic ability in his new home
town at the Dapper Dan

- Roundball Classic bywinning

the slam-dunk competition.

But what has Garrick Thomas
done since then?

Arguably, the only thing that
most Panther fans associate him
with is the game—winning three-
pointer he hit with one second
left to upset ﬁfth-ranked Seton
Hall his freshman season.

But after averaging 19 points
and 11 rebounds his senior year
at MacArthur High School in
Houston, Thomas has only
averaged 4.6 points and" 1.9
rebounds.in his Pitt career. He

has" only scored above -19 ‘twice’ '

this season.
But why is Thomas like this?
It is extremely difficult to
understand why anyone goes
through slumps. In basketball, if
you hit a slump, the coaches tell
you to shoot your way out of it.
There are so many intangibles
involved, like release point or
rotation, that the only way to
cure it is to hope it cures itself. .
Thomas hasn’t been in a
slump for the last three years. It
has been streakiness and incon-
sistency that have hampered the
growth of this gifted athlete.
This is unfortunate because
when he gets hot, he has virtual-

‘ ly unlimited range. He can hit

from anywhere. Evidence of
this is Saturday’s game against
Miami. He scored 20 points,
making seven of 12 ﬁeld goal
attempts and connecting on six
of 10 from three—point land.
“We all know that Garrick

‘ ‘Thomas can shoot open threes,”

coach Ralph Willard said of
Thomas’ effort. “And he got
some great looks at the basket

tonight and knocked them

down.”

Another important factor has
been playing time —- namely
the lack thereof. In three years,
he has only started four games,
three under Paul Evans, and has
averaged 11 minutes a game.
Perhaps the reason Thomas
scored 20 against the ‘Canes is
that he played 32. Ten minutes
isn’t long enough for a player to
get into a rhythm or get to ﬁnd
his shooting touch if he misses
one or two shots.

It’s a good thing the Miami
Hurricanes came to town,
because any other team would
have licked its chops and
buried Pitt’s 21-point first half
output.

Instead, Miami, which has
never beaten Pitt in the regular
season, only mustered 23 first

half points
and conse-

handed the
Panthers its

Big East
wins of the season, winning
67-61 at a sold out Fitzgerald
Field House Saturday night.

The win came on the heels
of the Panthers’ Wednesday
night victory over Boston
College.

“I can’t remember how it
feels, it’s been so long,” Pitt
forward Chris Gant said of
Pitt’s second straight confer-
ence win. “Everybody is
happy right now; it feels great.
I just hope we can continue
this feeling for the rest of the
season.”

The last time Pitt won two
consecutive Big East games
dates back to last January. The
win raised the Panthers" record

to‘7=-‘1’5‘5' and 3- 1 1 ‘ in ‘le‘a'gu’e’

play. Miami dropped to 11-10
and 6-7.

After getting out of the
blocks slow, Pitt turned it on in
the second half, as the
Panthers canned nine of 11
three-pointers, en route to a
school record-tying 14 treys
for the game. ~

After two consecutive close
losses, the Pitt wrestling team
took out its frustrations this
past Friday night with a 26-10
victory over the Mountaineers
of West Virginia at Fitzgerald
Field House.

The 21st-ranked Panthers
improved their record to 13-9
overall and 3-3 in the Eastern
Wrestling League with the
victory.

Just by the looks on the
Panthers’ faces in the pre-
match warm-ups, it was easy

to see that Pitt would
settle for nothing less than a
victory.

Pitt’s Chris Stevens got the
Panthers rolling with a big six
points for the team in the first
match of the evening. Down
2-1 after the first period,
Stevens came back to pin
Gary Harris of WVU in the
second to win the 118-pound
division.

“Stevens got us off on the
right foot with his victory,”
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. “He was down early but
came right back.”

But what can Thomas do
now?

Many have argued that
Thomas is a prototype for
Willard’s style of basketball.
He can play in Willard’s up-
tempo system. He can run the
ﬂoor and ﬁnish the break,

,playing either the two-guard
or small forward position.

Well, the only way we will
know if he can ﬁt into
Willard’s system is to let him
prove it. Give him the minutes
to ﬁnd confidence in his shot
and his ability. Why not let
him start the last four games
and the Big East Tournament
and give some stability to a
position that has seen four dif-
ferent players start there this
season?

Lobo, who also collected four
rebounds, three blocks and six
assists, credited the Lady
Panther defense for holding
Connecticut to just 40 percent
shooting, 10 percent below its
season average.

The Lady Huskies, the only
unbeaten team in Division I
men’s or women’s basketball,
outrebounded the Lady Panthers
44-42. Guard Stephanie Petho
led Pitt with six rebounds. Pitt
dished out a mere seven assists
as a team compared to UConn’s
20. UConn also drained 20 free
throws to Pitt’s eight. I

The Lady Panthers committed
24 turnovers with 11 coming
from Morton.

“We needed to be Houdini to
beat this team,” Bruce said.
“They’re the No.1 team all
around. They got it all.”

That statement is hard to
argue against. Lobo is second in
the country with 3.6 blocks per
game. Her twin tower counter-
part, Wolters, is 10th with 2.6.
The team’s 91.7 points per
game ranks ﬁrst in the nation, as
does its 56.5 points allowed per
game. UCon-n beats its, oppo-
nents by an average of 35.2
points per game, also tops in the
country.

“They’re still hungry this late
in the season,” Bruce said.
“Maybe we can take something
from that.”

The struggling Lady Panthers
traveled to Providence on
Sunday for an afternoon game.
Then they ﬁnish up the regular
season at home with games
against Syracuse and Villanova.

were just about naked.”

Swingman Garrick Thomas
came off the bench to lead the
three-point blitzkrieg. He con-
nected on six threes, as he
scored 20 for the game.

“I came out thinking I was
going to stop my man on
defense and give the team a
spark, and just let the offen-
sive end come to me,” Thomas
said. “That’s what I’ve done,

_ and I think I fired up the guys,

and we cranked it up and got it
going.”

After Miami’s Steven
Edwards hit three straight
three-pointers, Pitt was down
five with 15:26 left in the sec-
ond half. But Thomas retaliat-
ed with a three of his own, and
then Jaime Peterson dove for a
loose ball and passed it to a
streaking Thomas, who found
Andre Alridge for an easy
layup —— tying the game at 37.

The Panthers would never
look back. Alridge, who

scored a game—high 23 points‘

and dished out 10 assists, hit a
pair of free throws, and Pitt
never trailed from that point
on.

Miami "tied the score on the
next possession, but Orlando
Antigua and Alridge hit con-
secutive threes, and Antigua
hit a running ﬂoater across the
lane to give Pitt a six-point
advantage with 10:25 remain-
ing.

Miami’s power forward
Steve Rich scored five straight
points after that, cutting the
lead to one. But Pitt turned it
on, led by a quick 8-2 run,
which was capped off by an
Alridge wide open three-point-
er in the corner.

The Panthers held a seven-
point advantage up to the one-
minute mark. And when the
Hurricanes desperately tried to
foul, Alridge responded by hit-
ting ﬁve—for-six free throws in
the ﬁnal 51 seconds to seal the
win.

“You have to give Pittsburgh
credit,” Miami coach Leonard
Hamilton said. “They’ve had a
lot of tough losses, andfor
them to maintain their concen-
tration and come out and shoot
the ball as well as they did, it
says a lot about the character
of this team.”

But as sharp as Pitt shot in
the second half, it was the
stark opposite in the first
frame. ‘

The Panthers shot a putrid
27.6 percent in the first half,
while only hitting three
non-three-point hoops. Also,
oddly enough, the Panthers
didn’t attempt a free throw all
half.

Miami didn’t do that much
better, though. The ‘Canes
only shot 36 percent in the half
—— thus the reason for their
pathetic 23-21 lead going into
halftime.

The first half was so slow
that Antigua’s three at the 8:46
mark tied the game at 11. This
came after Pitt opened the
game down 7-0.

Pitt plays next against a
slumping Syracuse squad.
Game time is 8 p.m. Tuesday.
