Recession incites Pitt cutbacks in classrooms

by Kelly Thomas
Staff IV/‘lie/'

As the -economy ﬂounders, Pitt
schools and departments are trying to
cut  without cutting educational
quality:

After the Pennsylvania government
announced in December that it would
withhold $11.3 million appropriated to

ﬁnd ways to reduce operating costs
InanopenletterinDecember, Chan-
cellor Maik Nordenberg announced

‘ that he would distiibute the budget cuts

evenly throughout Pitt’s four main oper-
atingcenters One of those four, the Of-
ﬁce of the Provost, indudes all academic
areas except the health sciences

James Knapp, senior associate dean '

of the College of Arts and Sciences, said
that CAS would keep educational quality
and research the school’s top priorities
“We’ve made wonderfulprogress in
thelastfewyearsinimprovingthe qual-
ity of the education we provide to our

students, both undergraduate and grad-
uate,andthelastthingwewantto do is
jeopardize that progress,” said Knapp in
an e—mail.

Although CAS has set some general
guidelines for saving money, Knapp said
they were  with  de-
partmentstomakesureneedsaremet

“So we’re  to be smart about
this,” said Knapp in the e-mail, “rather
than just impose a one—size—ﬁts—all solu-
tion on everyone.’ ’

English Department Chair David

Bartholomae said the departInent’s op— '
 was cutby about 5 per— .

cent. The operating budget includes of-
ﬁce supplies, bills,  support and
iacultytravel ‘

In order to help meet the new bud-
get, Bartholomae said the department
renegotiated a contract with Computing
Services and Systems Development to
reduce the hours its computer 
stays on site. '

-“Our  concern there was to

preserve travel opportunities for those
who need it most,’ ’ said Bartholomae
Some faculty members also gave up

_ travel opportunities so that others could

travel instead, he said, which saved the
department $12,000 and helped balance
the budget ,

In other areas, however,‘ solutions
haven’t been so easy. 5 _

“The way we felt it most strong was
that we had to suspend. searches [for
ﬁculty] that were unclerwayg” said Bar-
tholomae _ i A

He said the department planned to
resume the searches when the economy
improves, and that althoughit may not
beabletolaireanynewfacultymembers,
it would not haveto lay off any, either

Bartholomae said the department had
not yet  any numbers for the in-
structional budget for next semester:

“I thinkiﬁs safe to saywe’llbeoEering

“Rather than two classes set at [an en-

Vampires were cooler before they were all popular  

by Andrew Hicks
Calummlit

In theilast decade, vampires have

' been pulled from the  of folk
' legend, B-mdvies. and novels with

names like “The Bloody Night Dark-
ness Trilogy” to the forefront of pop

K ular culture. They now have movies, i

television series, books, video games
and apparently their own weekend.
Long gone are the days of the
cape-wearing, cofﬁn-dwelling vam-
pire, whose meals consisted- mainly
of roving gangs of noblemen whose

horse-drawn carriages always man- '

aged to conveniently blow a tire
directly on the doorstep of Castle
You’reallgoingtodie, which I guess
they always assumed was Transylva-
nian for “Holiday Inn.”

The typical vampire of today’s
mediaisalmostaspaleasheisan—
drogynous He’s a lanky, hypersexual
being who’s ashamed of his animal-
istic tendencies, yet is drawn by his

condition to go searching for people '

to drain in the middle of the night

So, where did this vampire obses-
sion come from? I think ifs because
vampires are the ultimate bad boys,
the mythological equivalent of the
seniors in  school who got to
stay out as late as they wanted and
smoked  in the  lot
after class Vampires as protagonists
aren’t_ really evil anymore, they’re jus
bad inﬂuences. '

I Of course, there are usually evil

' vampires who the  vampires

end up defying through the power
of true love, a newfound respect
for humanity or whatever feel-good
message drives the plot. But even
these antagonists are less like demon-
ic murder machines and more like
Hans Gruber in “Die~Hard.” They
rriight make a snarky comment and
kill a person every once in a while,
but you just don’t get that same sense
of them  an immortal force of
darkness anymore. '
The origin of this problem can
be traced all the way back to “Sesame
Stree ” which introduced a friendly

vampire named Count Von Count, .

lust for blood with a love of count-
ing, priming an entire generation of
children with the idea of the good
vampire —— but you can’t completely
pacify a vampire, as became shock-
ingly clear in an unaired episode from
1996 where the original Count got
away from his handlers and drained
the life out of two cameramen before
Big Bird could drive a_ sharpened No.
2 pencil into his heart A new Count
was hired soon after, and everyone
who works with him is outﬁtted with
a vial of holy water and the letter T.

So now that authors have fully
explored the horror aspect of vam-
pires and audiences are  to ac-
cept the gentle. but tortured vampire
as a character, theyfve moved on to
romance “I know he’s a soulless, un-
holy killer, but I can change him,” the
love interest says,  doe eyes at
the vampire as he dabs the blood of
his last victim from the corners of his
mouth.

We even have vampire family
dramas now, where the vampire hus-
band comes home from a rough day
at the vampire ofﬁce, hits his vampire

wife in ﬁront of the vampire kids and
is carted away by the vampire police
to vampire jail. '

Not only do these writers have
the gall to subject us to these awful
plotlines, but they go on to complete-
ly rewrite the mythos as they see fit

‘The whole “vampires die if they

' come in contact with sunlight”

either they write about a post-apoca-

- blow up the sun, or they just make up

a reason why their vampires can go
to high school without turning into
a pile of dust. In the end, nothing is
sacred. Vampires can’t step foot on
holy ground? Mine are atheists and
just get really uncomfortable around
the clergy. Vampires hate garlic? Not
really, only Dracula did. He was al-
lergic '

But all of these changes serve
only to cheapen the conﬂicts that
would make a vampire character’s
life interesting I would have been far
more inclined to see “Twilight” if it
were about a  and her odd, pale

' friend who darts "nervously from

shadow to shadow and mysteriously ,

disappears from the lunchroorri on
Pasta Day.

" But as we speak, the idea of the"

good vampire is  as entirely
played out as “a normal guy becomes
the Grim Reaper” or “comic relief
Jesus,” and something else will soon
be dragged out to take its place. Per-

sonally, I’m pulling for Frankenstein '

I can see it‘ now “Frank and
Stein,” a novel about a young mon-
ster named Frank who must come

‘an abomination stitched together

from scavenged body parts while ,

You can’t land on a track that doesn’t turn

up the beat and make the pulse race with dance-
rock energy.
If you’re looking to feel the power of the syn-

‘ thesizer, you’vegotiton“Birds of Prey’ ’or“Lala.”

And there’s nothing wrong with some synth-

I rich pop.

But there is a time and place

Von IVa’s never—quit approach to the beat
is a perfect match with the want-to-quit center
that is the gym. Feel motivated enough .to get
dressed in your sweats and tennis shoes, but not
to spend 30 minutes on the treadmill? Von Iva is
your friend. A *

Decide to wait until 3 am. the night before to
‘finish your term. paper? Von Iva is your ﬁiend.

Want to dance the night away? Von Iva is
your friend.

Now, there are only so many ways you can
play a so-ul—style vocal with a pulsing dance beat.

Unless you’re hyped up on Red Bull and
speed, that stuff can get old pretty quick. Then,
you get your musical energy crash, conﬁning
your listening habits to sleepy folk songs and
chamomile tea to recoup.

That doesn’t mean it’s bad. Its just not mul-
tipurpose There’s no range here, no reprieve»
from the pounding beat. I

Only once does the band get remotely close
to a  of pace And if Girir On Fibre can
claim one stand—out song, it’s “Emerald Eyes.”

The lyrics don’t scream poetry, with gems
like “I get lost in the sky of your emerald eyes.”
But if you want poetry with your dance—rock,
you might have to sync up your favorite techno
groove to a  of \W1lliam Butler Yeats

It has a vintage feel, with a drurnbeat pacing
the tune to dance step—like rhythm. It could be a
doo—wop classic with that underlying bass.

Onlyjillian Iva’s vocals and a key change that
brings in a bit of that Von Iva style piece this one
together with its synthesizer—loving siblings

It would be nice to see the softer side of Von
Iva for ‘just one song

To quote “Birds Of Prey?’ “I need as

change”

Choose your music wisely Take Von Iva for
what it does well. Dance the energetic dance of
the caffeine-addlod children. Embrace the beat.
Love it or hate it, but know Von Iva can use a
synthesizer like it’s 1989. ‘

bigger role

by Emily Steiner _
Staﬁ’ Writer

Mycaiah Clemons always knew
running would be her ticket to get-
ting a stellar education. It’s what
she’s done with that education
that’s made her a different type of
student—athlete.

In person, she’s bubbly but
humble. She works to keep her
team together, but she wants to
do well for herself. She’s proud of
what she’s done, but she wants to
do better.

One of the best examples of
Clemons' character is her status
as co—captain of the Pitt women’s
track team, especially after last sea-
son didn’t see a captain at all.

“It was disappointing,” said
Pitt coach Alonzo Webb of las>t
year’s captain situation. “Last year
[the team members] were just not
strong enough to make the tough
decisions that need to be made, so
I just didn’t name any captains.”

It changed this year.

“This year, Mycaiah and a few
others separated themselves, and
they understood that we did need
the team leadership. I think she’s
been a good leader so far, 
the kids like her. She’s tough on

Pitt bounces
gback_ with
EAGL win

by Laura Veith
For T /1: Pill New

A crowd ﬁlled with black and
gold cheered Pitt’s blue  gold

to a gymnastics win against North _

Carolina State on Sunday.

The Panthers came from be-
hind in the final rotation to defeat
NC State 195.300-194.450 at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

“This was a well-deserved
win,” said Pitt coach Debbie

‘Yohman after the meet. “This is

.what we’ve been working on all"

season.”
The Panthers started out with
a small lead after the first rotation,
only to fall behind by a marginal
0.6 points going into the third ro-
' tation.
“I knew we were down,” said
Pitt senior Anya Chayka, “but you
try not to let it affect you.”
Posting a career-high 9.900 on
Eihe beam, Chayka helped close
I the gap and set her team up for
its first EAGL conference win.
After last weeks close loss to

rival West Virginia, the Panthers 

hit the gym focusing on high-
pressure situations, said Yohman.

In the loss, the beam proved
to be the toughest challenge for
the gymnasts, and Sunday’s meet
displayed the week’s hard work.

A “Last week, the girls were too

'nervous,’’ said Yohman. “And

.you can’t do good gymnastics
carefully.”

The‘Panther’s seem to have
shaken any early season nerves

__{_,and replaced them with much
needed conﬁdence.

“We always know we can do
well during practice, but we had
to focus on bringing it to the
meet, said Chayka. “And today

gwe brought it.” '

Earlier this week, senior Dani
Bryan was named EAGL Special-
ist of the Week, and freshman
Alicia Talucci was honored as
Rookie of the Week.

1, Pitt’s win improved them to
3-3, 1-2 in the EAGL. The Pan-
thers will next travel to Rutgers
on Saturday. '

But whatever momentum Notre“

Dame built, Pitt put to a halt with a
strong beyond-the-arc performance
in the first ‘half, going 4-of-6. The

_ perimeter game allowed the Panthers

to then work the ball into the paint,
positioning them to earn easy buck-
ets with free throws. Pitt ﬁnished the
first half going 10-of-12 from the

line.
 ‘ V Zellous led the way for the Pan-
thers in the first half, tallying 11 points

Pitt walked into halftime leading
40-31.
The break sparked the Fighting

Irish, as they jumped all over Pitt in i

the game’s second half with a 15-7
run. Notre Darne’s second wind mir-
rored Pitt’s early effectiveness, but
a resilient Panthers team bent, but
didn’t break.

. Notre Dame (16-5, 5-4) saved
face in‘ the half ’s early goings, but
Pitt’s balanced attack proved too
much for the visiting Fighting Irish.

Both Stewart and Taneisha Har-
rison ﬁnished the game with 17

‘points, while Shayla Scott earned a

career-high 18 rebounds. Freshman

Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson conttib— i i

uted with 12 rebounds of her own.
Even though Berenato was im-
pressed with the performance, it

i wasn’t anything she didn’t see com-

ing. In fact, Berenato’s expectations
for the game were simple. I

“We expected to win tonight,”

them when she needs to .be, but
she’s also understanding. She cares
about what she’s doing.”

ton, which is just northwest of
Pittsburgh, Clemons was raised'in
an athletic family. Her older and
younger brothers played football,
baseball and basketball. She and
her oldersister ran track and brief-
ly played basketball. -

going to get our schooling paid
for,” said Clemons. “Growing up,
it was either run or don’t go to col-
lege.”

After excelling in track at Val-
ley High School — she was named
an All-American her senior year
— Clemons decidedto take her
talents away from home and head
to Blacksburg, Va., to run for Law-
rence Johnson at Virginia Tech. ,

“[Virginia] Tech was a good
school academically,” said Clem-
ons. “And his track program

me to the next level athletically.”
That next level —.the Olym-
pics —-— was a goal of hers.

But a ,mix of homesickness

Growingup in New Kensingg

“[Running] was how we were _

worked in a way that would take _

and some disagreements with the

coaches led Clemons back home
to join a program that she was
familiar with for her sophomore
year. " i I

And because of the violence
that conspired on Virginia Tech’s
campus on April 16, 2007 — the
year after’ Clemons left — she feels
that she might’ve been "meant to
return to Pittsburgh.

“[The shooting] didn’t really af-
fect me too much, but I felt bad
for everybody else that was there,”

said Clemons.’ “It was shocking,_

because I could be down there.
Some people said, ‘Well maybe
it was a sign from God that you

were supposed to leave,’ because I "

could’ve been  that building.”
- Since she’s been here, Clemons

‘has undoubtedly made her mark.

In addition to stepping up as a
leader and captain of her team,

she broke the school record in the.

60-meter hurdles at the Big East
Indoor Championships last sea-
son. She took second in the event,
missing first by only .06 seconds.
“Knowing that my name is
going to be in thehisétory books

‘forever is something that was re-

ally exciting to me,” said Clemons.
“But I don’t want to leave it at that,
I want to do something bigger. My
accomplishments will be set this
year, for sure.”

For her senior season, Clemons
hopes to win the Big East Indoor
competition in both the 60-meter
hurdles and 60-meter sprint, in ad-
dition to the outdoor 100-meter
hurdles. I _ ‘

After that happens, she has her
eyes set on breaking school records
in both hurdling events and mak-

' éé § _ .

[Running] was how we

were going to get our school-
ing paid for. Growing up, it

was either run or don't go to

college.

ing indoor and outdoor nationals. » ’

All of this,fand she still man—_
ages a 4.0 grade-point average.

“It’s a lot -to do if you’re look-..i—i.

Clemons left Virginia Tech for Pitt

ing to just have a fun social time
in college,” said Clemons. “It’s not
anything above and beyond for me.’
I just make sure I get done what
needs to be done before itvneeds
to be done. And that’s it.”
Webb has a similar outlook.

“She’s really focused, she cares
about being good, and she wants
to be-the best,” said Webb. “She
wants to eventually qualify for na-
tionals, and I think she’ll do it this

year. She’s been working hard for i

it.” . .

Clemens will continue to work
hard both on and off the track.
And she knows if she slacks off,
it’s her own fault.

“At the end of the day, coach is

not going to be sitting at yourdesk _

beside you, making sure you’re

doing your work,” said Clemons.

“Coach isn’t going to be the one,
on the track,  your legs,
making sure they move fast. It’s all
about you making sure that you get
that done, and you practice to that
point and you study to that point

where you can get down there and ’
.. _-“make the grades and make the
times.”
