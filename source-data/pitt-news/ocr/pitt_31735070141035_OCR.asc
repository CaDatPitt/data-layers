Two investors sued by Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University last week
have been accused of rnisappropriat-
ing more than $500 million. _

Federal agents accused Paul Green-
wood and Stephen Walsh, whom the
universities ﬁled a complaint against

last Friday, of $553 million in secu1i— V

ties and wire fraud from about 1996 to
this February. The two were working
for Westtidge Capital Management
Inc, based in Delaware They are ac-
cused of  the money to buy rare
books, horses, teddy bears — valued
at as much as $80,000 — and a home
for Walsh’s ex—wife.

Pitt invested an estimated $65
million in Westtidge Capital Manage-
ment and its partners, according to
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, which is also  a suit against
Greenwood and Walsh.

Pitt vice chancellor of public affairs
Robert Hill and CIVIU spokeswoman
Teresa Thomas released a joint state-
ment last Friday saying that the uni-
versities had called for a temporary
restraining order against Greenwood
and Walsh.

Thomas said in the statement that
there was “insufficient information
available” to determine how much
money CMU had invested with
Westiidge Capital. An article in the

Panhandlers cited forusing milk crates

by Lori Stover
Staﬂ Wrtfer

To curb panhandling on Oak-

land streets, the Pitt police are
looking to the law for alternative
strategies.
i One method includes enforc-
ing a state law that restricts the use
of carts, cases, trays, baskets, boxes
and other containers.

Though the law has existed
for at least two decades, the police

have just applied it to panhandlers,
said Pitt police chief Tim Delaney.

Pitt police recently cited
Roosevelt Lewis Bell for illegally
using a milk crate and obstructing
a sidewalk. Police have cited others
for this offense, Delaney said.

He added that the police use the
law to encourage panhandlers to
move away from Oakland streets
and to allow other pedestrians to
move freely.

“As heavily traveled as the side-
walks are, if you put a crate down
and sit on it, you’re obstructing a
good portion of the sidewallg” he
said. V

The law prevents people from
taking crates that dairy companies
use to transport milk to_ stores.

Dairy companies and others
that lend out or use crates and
containers lost so many of these
items that Pennsylvania passed a

use without the owner’s perrnis—

The law says that a person may
not use a crate "off the owner’s'
premises or in a nearby parking lot
without permission. In addition,
the crate must be marked with the
owner’s name or mark. I

Vic Walczak, legal director
of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said he doesn’t know of
any instances of police. enforcing
this law. '

“I’ve never heard of this law
being enforced and certainly not
in this context,” said Walczak. “It

-appears that Pitt police are using

this law as a pretext to harass pan-
handlers.”
This application could consti-

tute harassment, because police __

use the law for something other
than its original purpose and typi-

cally don’t ‘contact the owner, he

said.

Walczak also questioned the
police’s application of Pennsylva-
nia’s obstruction statute.

The law deﬁnes “obstructs” as

reasonable inconvenience or haz-

occupy the sidewalk to the point so
that people walking couldn’t easily
step around, said Walczak.
Delaney said the police must
ask the individual if he owns the

milk crate and almost always, the‘

person tells the ofﬁcer he doesn’t.
“In. most cases, they ad-
mit that it’s not theirs,” he said.
“They don’t want the hassle.”
If the person claimed to own
the crate, the police would call the

_'contact number on theiside of the

crate and ask the owner if the per-
son had permission, said Delaney.

 Jay: Asexuals explore

intimacy in new Ways

“There’s nothing wrong with me, I can
live my life and be happy. Asexual people
are exploring new ways to think about inti-
macy,” said Jay. .

Many people deﬁne themselves as asex-
ual but still find themselves attracted to
others, just not sexually.

“All of the things that sexual people’s
bodies go through happen to asexual peo-
ple too,” said Jay.

This means that asexuals have the ability
to have sex but they do not have the desire
to take part.

Jay started the Asexual Visibility and
Education Network in 2001 to provide
support and friendship to people like him.
The networkpnow has the largest asexual
outreach program in the world.

The Rainbow Alliance president,]oseph
Yarsky, helped bring Jay to speak.

“We received a good amount of general
body feedback indicating a strong interest
in an asexual speaker.

"He stands for many of the same prin-
ciples that Rainbow Alliance does. Current-
ly we have active members who identify
themselves as asexual,” said Yarsky

“Asexuals will deﬁnitelyrelate the best
with Jay, but_I feel that the campus body
as a whole can benefit from this speaker
that promotes visibility and education for
all sexual orientations,” he said.

totheeditor

To the Editor, \

I am  in response to the “Obama’s policies strip lib-
erties” column by Giles Howard. I couldn’t agree more with
what Howard wrote It’s nice to see someone advocating the
return of personal liberties as opposed to more government
intervention in light of the “economic crisis”

When the government steps in to take control of the eco-
nomic situation, it only ends up  matters worse The
laws of economics can be likened to the laws of physics —
you can’t break them without consequences.

When the government tries to curb the current recession

by printing money and government jobs, it is doing .

the exact opposite of what should be done. Through inﬂation,
the value of the dollar decreases, thus  up the prices
of goods and services. Essentially this means our dollar buys
us less Additionally,  more government jobs is useless
because the government does not produce any tangible goods
and services and thus does not contribute to increasing our
GDP ' I

In order to recover from the current recession, the free
market must be allowed to cleanse itself of the rampant mal-
investments present in many  of our economy. While
this may mean struggling through a mild depression, itwillpale
in comparison to the one we will surely suﬁer if the govern-
ment is allowed to continue on its current course of action

Twin sisters, one redhead make country coo

Ben Kweller returns to his roots

by Justin Jacobs
A0’E E9itor

Let’s get the obvious part out of
the way ﬁrst — Ben Kweller, the fop—
pish, high—voiced singer-songwiiter
who’s been banging out garage rock
since he was a preteen, just put out
his first country record. As in, Tex-
as—boy-showing—his—roots country.

‘F**k you man,’ but we gotta label
things because we got a language so
we can explain  to people,”
said Kweller from his home in Aus-
tin, Texas. “If you want to ‘call it a
country record, so be it, I don’t care.
But it is just another. Ben Kweller al-
bum.”

Good country music’s all about

But like the the story, and
best folks in the Ben Kweller with not surprisingly,
genre, Kweller’s The Watson Twins Kweller’s jew-
always been a ish, rock ’n’ roll,
storyteller. And Dﬁggizdgéuihpsfige boy—wonder-in-
though his la-test 41914313800 the—South tale is
record, Cbangzhg among the best
Harm‘, is more Now I 27,

rodeo than rock ’n’ roll, the familiar
playfulness and hard-to-hate sun-
shine songs fans have known for
years make this Kweller’s best in
years.

And yes, he knows its country.

“They did the same  to
Bob Dylan when he put out Now}:-
vi//e S@ui'ne, and I even call that his
country record. He’d probably say,

Watson Twins’ folk rock isn't

Kweller wrote his first song when
he was only 8 and “sounded like a
little  with a Southern accent”
Naturally, this didn’t sit well with the
aspiring cowboy rocker.

“I was in fifth grade, and I made
a cassette for my friend who was
really into AC/ DC. My two songs
were country piano songs, and I
gave him the tape. He came back

the next day and said,  you 
like a girl,”’ said Kweller. “I was so
devastated and bummed. So I tried
to make my voice sound tougher. I
didn’t want to sound like a p***y to
my friend.”

His family had moved from Cali-
fornia to Texas when he was a year
old, making his eventual laid—back
California sur1shine—child attitude
a bit of a surprise. Especially given
that his childhood idols were Garth
Brooks and Alan Jackson. But ado-
lescence — and the early ’90s —
threw him for a loop.

“This little band called Nirva-
na came out. I was at a skate park
when I first heard ‘Smells Like Teen
Spirit,’ and I literally pulled over and
said, ‘What the f**k is this,”’ said
Kweller.

For one  it was inspiration.
By the time“ he had his bar mitzvah,
Kweller was putting out records in
the band Radish, going on to play
both David Letterman’s and Conan
O’Brian’s shows and touting inter-

For Chandra and Leigh Wat-‘
son, being 6-foot—tall identical
twin sisters isn’t the only unique
thing they’ve got going for them.

They’re also the harmonizing,
guitar strumming, folk singing in-
die rock artists, performing as ——
surprisel ——- The Watson Twins.

Best known for their collabo-
ration with Jenny Lewis on Rabbit
Fur Coat, the sisters broke out on
their own in 2008 and will come
to Pittsburgh this Saturday to
open for Ben Kweller at Diesel
Club Lounge.

.It’s hard to guess by the Wat-
son’s soft sound and sweet har-
monies, but indie folk hasn’t al-
ways been their cup of tea.

“There was a large punk scene
and hardcore scene, so that’s kind
of where we grew up, going to
see these punk shows and hard-
core shows,” Chandra Watson
told The Pitt News about her
hometown Louisville, Ky.

But as their musical abili-
ties irnproved and their tastes
changed, so did their music, and
they weren’t alone.

“It’s funny, because cut to
years later now, all my friends who
were in hardcore bands are now
playing Americana or alt—country
indie rock,” laughed Watson.

After a few years in the Lou-
isville music scene, Chandra and
Leigh moved out to Silver Lake,
Calif, where their voices caught
the attention or Rilo Kiley’s lead
singer Jenny Lewis.

Dublin's fashion is fresh

air compare

by Julia Nauer
Staff Writer

They say the grass is always greener on
the other side. W/ell, that’s literally true if you
cross over to the other side of the ocean.

For the past three weeks I’ve been living
in Dublin, Ireland, but the gorgeous green
landscape does have one drawback —— the
weather. It’s very similar to Pittsburgh’s, as
in cold, gray, rainy, unpredictable. But the
Irish don’t seem to let the weather affect their
wardrobes. Pittsburgh could take a few cues.

It seems as diough everyone is always well
dressed and makes an effort to not roll out
of bed in their sweats. Yup, even for class.
Attention to detail, as well as displaying per-
sonal style seem to be key ingredients when
getting dressed. The everyday look here is a
little more rock ’n’ roll and mix and match
than m the United States.

And although everyone is dressed pretty
uniquely, there are a few deﬁning trends I’ve
noticed. Coats and boots are the foundations
of many outﬁtshere, as they are essential for
combating the sporadic rain. And the options
and variety seem endless. I

Whether it’s a tough-looking motorcycle I,

jacket, 21 long chunky cardigan or a brightly
colored pea coat, everyone seems to be don-
ning standout outerwear that brings their
looks together. Interesting cuts and out-of-
the-ordinary details keep everyone from
blending together. Boots ﬁnish the look off
with fringe detailing, buckles _or chunky low
heels in all sorts of funky colors. And stores
are bursting with options at affordable prices.

Tights and leggings are other essentials for

 

d to 'Burgh

. showcasing skirts and dresses in chilly weath-

er and are perfect for tucking into boots. One
thing I’ve noticed is the plethora of people
wearing jean skirts with leggings —— a look
that hasn’t been big in the United States for a
while. It’s everywhere here.

Floral—printed and brightly colored mini
skirts are also top items to pair with tights of
all colors and patterns. Leggings have been
big for a while obviously, but the way that the

. Irish girls ‘where them in versatile ways make

them feel fresh, especially pairing them with
unique Hats and even colorful sneakers.
Accessories are huge here. Everywhere
you go it seems that everyone has accessoiized
to the max. Armfuls of colorful bracelets are
vital for sprucing up your wrists and big bold

earrings for day or night to make an outﬁt '

pop. And no one forgets to decorate their
hair either with pretty headbands and cute lit-
tle barrettes with either ﬂower or bow details.

’ Scarves are a must, and  the variety
and selection is intense. Every color you could
imagine, plus plaids and other pretty patterns
make scarves the indispensable accessory and
offer an instant way to spice up any outﬁt A
lot of accessories seem either a little punky
and edgy or have a dainty feminine feel, al-
most like an English tea party. Next to each
other it’s an interesting juxtaposition.

But what really stands out to me most of
all is that everyone isn’t walking aroundlook-
ing like clones of each other, and it’s cool to
see everyone’s personal style shine through,
especially in dance clubs. i

To get the sa.me kind of look, I would
suggest browsing Topshop’s Web site —- they
deliver  the United States —— for trendy
pieces from the UK and  up H&.M for
some Euro-chic looks. Cheers!

KWeller's once-girly

Voice rocks new disc

' Kweller, page 7 —

nationally.

And though he might not have
sounded tougher on the CBS sound-
stage, a p***y he was not. Kweller
was an indie rock hero in England
before he could drive.

Alas, Radish spoiled by 1998 and
Kweller was on his own — and bet-
ter off for it. By 2002 he’d released
his first solo record Ska .5’/ya, an album
that straddled rootsy indie rock and
gut-punching brat—punk. And while
Kweller’s country roots took a back-
seat, they were undeniably still there.

Now with Cbanging Hones,
Kwellefs sixth solo record, Texas
is back. But don’t expect a Garth
Brooks hillbilly stomper. Home: is
ﬁlled with gorgeous acoustic ballads
(“Ballad of Wendy Baker”), plod-
ding steel-guitar workouts (“On Her
Own”) and catchy, sun—baked sing-
alongs (well, every song).

“A lot of the songs have been
written over the years,” said Kweller.
“I’d write one and say, ‘God, I love
this song, I want to make an album

like this.’ There were certain songs
I knew belonged on an album to-
gether with their cousins. And it just
seemed like the right time to make
this album.”

Before he’s even hit 30, Kweller

has been  a  in music

"for more than half of his life. And

with his ﬁrst son Dorian (whose
middle name Zev, matched with
Kweller’s middle name Lev, trans-

lates in »-Hebrew to “Lion Heart’

and wife Lizzy by his side, Kweller
shows no signs of slowing down.

“I’m not good at  else.
Iknewthatearlyon—thankGod
I got lucky and got a record deal
when I was so young. But there’s
other  I love — science, his-
tory, the outdoors, camping and
ﬁshing,” said Kweller.

“I always say if I was doin’
something else, I’d be a park ranger

-or a professional ﬁsherman. But I’d
probably get bored of that -—- I’m'

an artist ﬁrst and foremost. Music is

my thing.”

Talucci

's top class is gym(nastiCS)

Diana Connor / Senior Staff Photographer

Pitt freshman Alieia‘Talucci balances on the beam in a meet earlier
I I’ this year. Talucci earned the EAGL Gymnast of the Week honors.

 

by Laura Veith
Staﬁ’ Wrtter

Algebra is harder than gym-
nastics for Alicia Talucci.

Coming out of class, she’s
more frazzled than you’ll ever see
her during a meet.

“In the gym I have to try,” said
Talucci. “But school is so much
harder.”

Adjusting to life as a student
athlete is challenging for any
freshman. For Talucci, the athlete
part comes naturally.-

Sitting in her chair before a
meet at Fitzgerald Field House,
Talucci is surrounded by blue
mats and chalk dusting every sur-
face. Listening to Michael Buble
on her iPod, Talucci is calm and
composed. She doesn’t get ner-
vous, and she doesn’t know why.

There are four events in gym-
nastics: the ﬂoor, bars, beam and
the vault. While most gymnasts
don’t compete in all four, Talucci
does. In last Friday’s loss to Michi-
gan State, Talucci tallied the high-
est all—around score for the week
in the Eastern Atlantic Gymnas-
tics League with a 39.250.

The highest a gymnast can
score is 40.00, but that is nearly
impossible. Since Talucci didn’t

start out the season competing in

all four events, her scores are that
much more impressive.

“Every week we would give
her a new routine or event, and
every week she would nail it.”
said Pitt coach Debbie Yohman.

Introverted and modest, one
would never know how the suc-
cess Talucci has already achieved
in only a few months as a Pan-
ther.

The EAGL is the Big East
of gymnastics (with a few other
schools added in or subbed out),
and so far the league has already
honored Talucci as Rookie of the
Week twice. Last Friday’s marks
earned her the top honors of
EAGL Gymnast of the Week,
rarely awarded to freshmen.

She’s not one to set lofty goals, I

rather she competes as hard as
she can every time. The only goal
she’s set for this season is to score
a 10.0 on her favorite event: the
vault. '

“Its not that hard,” says Ta-
lucci. “A lot of college athletes
do it.”

But it is hard, and it is rarely ~

done.

For the average person, the
vault is . a terrifying event. The
athlete has to sprint down an 80-
foot runway and then ﬂip one

The Pitt men’s basketball team
heads to Newark, N._]. Saturday to
take on the Seton Hall Pirates at
8:30 p.m.

But for one Panther, the trip
marks his first Big East game back
in his hometown. I

“We’re going to try to make it
a good homecoming,” said fresh-
man guard Ashton Gibbs. “We’re

just going to try to win and that _

will be the highlight of my home-
coming.” '
Gibbs recorded his best per-

 formance of the season in the

Panthers’ loss to Providence on
Tuesday. He turned in 14 minutes
and put up 15 points as Pitt’s late
rally came up short;

With the loss, Gibbs and the
rest of the Panthers (25—3, 12-3
Big East) learned that no team can
be taken lightly.

.“I 'think.it’s got us focused,”
said Gibbs about Pitt’s latest per-

formance. “A lot of guys weren’t '

ready. We’re the No. 1 team in the
country and teams are out there to
get us.”

prediction assumes they will lose
to Villanova on Saturdaynight, but
beat St; John’s and DePaul to close

I out the season 7-11 in the Big East.

Expectations placed on this
young team were immense, but just
how rightfully so is the question.

get to Connecticut guard  Price’s
iidiculous game later, because the
real story was forward Stanley Rob-
inson  this game over late in
the second half.

\W1th seven minutes togo, Con-
necticut trailed Mzrqllette by one.
Robinson threw down two dunks
and converted on a 3-point play af-
ter a layup to lead the Huskies down
the stretch. ’

Marquette not only lost the
game, but also senior point guard

Dominic James for the rest of the J

season after he broke a bone in his
foot. The injury ended James’ ca-
reer at Marquette, in which he was a
four-year starter and a leader for the

‘Golden Eagles.

Connecticut’s win was the 800th
of coach Jim Calhoun’s career.
Calhoun became just the seventh
coach in Division I history to win
800 games. Calhoun is second all-
time among active coaches, behind
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who
has 826 career victories.

well, had a forgettable two-game
stretch last week. Summers scored a

‘ respectable 12 points in a78-72 loss

to Marquette last Saturday, but com-

Hazell's scoring prowess
provides threat to Panthers

Men's basketball, page 10

expects the Panthers to be ready tomorrow.

‘When we’re down by 18 points, it’s a
number of different things,” he said about
the struggles in Providence. “W/e,’ll get it
back together, though. We alwaysdo.” -

Gibbs said he has roughly 125 tickets for
the ‘game, but he doesn’t expect to know ev-
erybody in those seats,

“My mom and my father have a PAL
team — a fundraiser —— so they’ll be bring-
ing a lot of kids,” said Gibbs.

With the Panthers playing in the heart

of the Big East, Dixon is excited to see his
players perform in front of their hometown
crowds. ,

“It’s a good opportunity for us to get
back home for a lot of guys,” ‘said Dixon.
“W/e’ll have a lot of people there.” M

The Pirates are coming off a 75-60 win
over South Florida on Wednesday. The loss
snapped their three-garne losing streak.

Sophomore guard Jeremy Hazell paced
the Pirates against the Bulls with 20 points.

.His 611 points lead the Big East, and his

22.6 points per game ranks second to Notre
Dame’s Luke Harangody. A

Like Pitt’s defeat in Providence, Seton
Hall (15-12, 6-9 Big East) will also salute its
seniors before tipoff.

“Coming from New Jersey, I’ve seen
[Seton Hall] play their hardest, said Gibbs.
“Coach [Bobby] Gonzalez is an energized
guy, and he’s going to have those guys
ready.” .

But returning to Pittsburgh with another
Big East win is all that matters for the Pan-
thers. Their loss to Providence dropped the
team into a tie for third place in the confer-
ence. . _

“It’s deﬁnitely going to be a good home-
coming,” said Gibbs. “A win wouldn’t hurt
at all.” -

Talucci nets first perfect
vault score since 2004

Talucci, page 10

way or another onto a smallstructure using
both hands and no feet, then complete a
few more ﬂips and twists in the air before
blindly landing perfectly straight with both
feet together. '
The last Pitt gymnast to score a 10.0 on
the vault was Alyse Zefﬁro in 2004.
“Every gymnast works toward perfec-

- tion, and. that’s.what the 10.0 is. It’s going

to be hard, but she is very capable,” said
Yohman.

Talucci started tumbling around at the
age" of 6. The only reason she began gym-
nastics was because her dad’s.friend opened
a gym, so her parents decided to throw her
in the mix. ' '

Nearly 10 expensive years later, Talucci

found herself training for the Olympic lev— ,

_ el. Once a surgery sidelined-her for a year,
college gymnastics was the only option.

“She wasn’t exactly ready to go when
she came here,” said Yohman. “But, we
recruited a great athlete, and she worked

hard. She’s‘an athlete that will continue to

progress.”
But Talucci isn’t concerned with how

she’s going to do or how she has already
done. Only a few hours away from a meet,
perched in her disheveled Sutherland
dorm, Talucci’s thoughts resemble those
of any other Pitt freshman. She hates
math, wishes she had money for laundry
and is hopeful to get one day off this week
to go snowboarding. I i

The Panthers have one remaining home
