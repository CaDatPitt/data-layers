NSABP stucly resumes enrollment

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

The nation’s largest breast
cancer prevention study has
resumed patient enrollment at
the University of Pittsburgh
and approximately 10 other
medical centers. ‘

The National Cancer
Institute halted enrollment of
the Breast Cancer Prevention
Trial, coordinated by the
National Surgical Adjuvant

Breast and Bowel Project, at
the beginning of April when
problems arose within the
NSABP, headquartered at
Pitt.

In March, reports of
research fraud at St. Luc’s
Hospital in Montreal sparked
inquiries about the reliability
of the data. As well as halting
enrollment of the BCPT, the
NCI also requested that
enrollment of two other stud-
ies be halted and NSABP

Chair Bernard Fisher resign.

According to the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Health Sciences
Bureau, changes were made
within the NSABP to address
data monitoring and quality
assurance issues.

This study investigates
whether taking the anti-can-
cer drug tamoxifen will pre-
vent development of breast

cancer in women who are at

If you are of Polish background and would like

In February of 1991 a collection of 45,000
Polish books were transferred to the University of

As of today, 7,251 of those Polish books have

Pitt junior Stacy
Chase decided two
years ago that she
would pursue a career
with the FBI.

She had gone to
Career Day where she
talked to an FBI repre-
sentative. She was
attracted to a career that-
seemed different and
exciting. A

“I don’t want an
office job,” she said. “I
like to be busy.”

But when a fight
broke out at Pitt on
April 1 and Chase,
along with five other
Pitt students, were
arrested, her chances to
work for the FBI may
have diminished.

That night, a fight
broke out in the William
Pitt Union during a
dance that brought area
high school students to
campus. Chase, Tamara
Goodman and six others
waited outside for a bus
to go to a bowling party
sponsored by National
Society of Black
Engineers when the
crowd spilled out from
the union. V

Campus police asked
the NSBE students to
leave.

“We said, ‘We’re col-

them our Pitt ID,
showed them our ticket
and they said ‘OK,”’
Goodman said. When
Goodman saw someone

Piﬁoffice combines veterans and disabled services

By Anthony Breznican
For The Pitt News

 

The name sounds deceiving,
but the Office of Veterans and
Disabled Student Services is
actually two separate offices
operating under the same roof.

The Office of Veteran
Services and the Office of
Disabled Student Services
were combined to form one
office, but each performs very

different, but important ser-
vices for many University of
Pittsburgh students.

The Office of Veteran
Services acts as a liaison
between the University of
Pittsburgh and the Department
of Veteran Affairs regional
offices in Pittsburgh and
Buffalo, New York.

“Our purpose is to process
paperwork for the 300—plus
veterans and their dependents

who attend the University of
Pittsburgh,” said office coordi-
nator Don Graffius.

This enables students who
are veterans or dependents of
veterans to be eligible to
receive VA educational bene-
fits they may be entitled to for
five different chapters under
Title 38 of the U.S. Code of
Federal Regulations, accord-
ing to Graffius.

Under the VA work-study

program, the ofﬁce uses quali-
fied eligible veterans or
dependents as work-study stu-
dents.

“The ofﬁce also maintains a
friendly atmosphere where our
students can feel free, should
problems arise, to discuss
them, and look for a possible
solution with fellow veterans,”
Graffius said. “We attempt to
maintain an air of comradery

JAKARTA, Indonesia —
President Clinton said
Wednesday that free trade with
Asia will open huge new mar-

kets to American goods and the

GATT global trade pact is a cru-
cial first step in reaching that
goal. .
“The most important thing
we can do is get the Congress to
go home and pass the GATT
agreement,” Clinton told busi-
ness leaders as he wound up
his visit to the 18-nation Asia
Economic Cooperation forum.
Outlining his arguments for
free trade in the Pacific region,
Clinton said, “By the year 2000,
the market for automobiles in
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand
and the Philippines will equal 
today’s market in Canada, in
Mexico combined.” —— Reuters

MOSCOW ——- Senior experts
at Russia’s influential USA-
Canada Institute on Wednesday
said relations between Moscow
and Washington could well
deteriorate after a sweeping
Republican victory in mid-terrn
elections.

Some in Moscow are worried
the Republican Party’s crushing
electoral gains, which gave it
control over both houses of
Congress, might force
Washington to take a much
ﬁrmer line with Russia.

This posed an especially dan-
gerous risk because Russian
ultra-nationalists gained an
unexpectedly large number of
seats in the State Duma lower
house of parliament in elections
last year. — Reuters

FORT MYERS, Fla. ——
Tropical Storm Gordon, chum-
ing in the Gulf of Mexico on
Florida’s southwestern coast,
appeared ready Wednesday to
take another swipe at the state.

Three people in Florida have
died in the storm, and 40 people
were injured by a twister from
Gordon. Shelters have been set
up for 200 people who were left
homeless.

Weather officials have also
put most of eastern, central an
southern Florida under a toma-
do watch from the twister that
killed at least one person in a
Brevard County retirement
community Tuesday night. --

WASHINGTON -- The chief
law officers from 17 states,
including Pennsyl—vania, have
asked the Federal
Communications Commission
to order MCI Communications
Corp. to stop charging callers
for its “1-800-CALL-INFO”
directory assistance service.

In an effort spearheaded by

Connecticut and Vermont, a
brief was ﬁled with the agency
Tuesday, alleging the service is
“inherently misleading because
virtually all consumers strongly
associate an 800 call with a
‘free’ call.”

AT&T Corp. recently ﬁled a
complaint with the FCC about
the new service, which MCI
introduced nationwide last
month.

An MCI official defended the
service, saying the company
does not charge consumers for
800 calls but for providing
directory assistance, which is a
$.75 charge. —Reuters

HARTFORD, Conn. — A
Connecticut businessman,
charged with manslaughter for
allegedly holding his father’s
hands to prevent the terminally
ill man from removing a plastic
bag on his head, has applied for
special probation.

William Meyer III of
Westport, Conn., asked Superior
Court Judge Thomas Miano for
accelerated rehabilitation, which
means the charges would be
dropped after the petitioner ful-
filled probationary requirements
established by the court.

Meyer, 65, is accused of
assisting the suicide of his
father, \V1lliam Meyer Jr., 88, on
July 30, 1991. The elderly man

an increased risk of getting it.

According to the UPMC Health
Sciences News Bureau, tamoxifen was
chosen for the study based on evidence
that new cancer did not appear in the
unaffected breast of patients who were
treated with this drug for breast cancer.

The study also investigates whether
tamoxifen lowers the number of deaths
from heart attacks and reduces the num-
ber of bone fractures.

“This is the most important study we
can do over the next decade to find out
how to prevent breast cancer,” said Dr.
Ronald Herberman, principal investiga-
tor of the BCPT and director of the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. “We expect
the rapid, steady addition of the rest of
the 300 BCPT-participating sites as each
one processes the new BCPT protocol
through its institutional review board.”

The Office of Disabled
Students provides special ser-
vices for Pitt students with a
wide range of disabilities.

“The purpose of this office
is to give students the tools to
know what they need to do to
alleviate their disability that
would ultimately lead to [the
student’s] independence,”
said Coordinator of Disabled
Services Marcie Roberts.

The office helps to provide
disabled students with every-
thing from tape-recorded text-
books for the visually
impaired, to a wheelchair lift-
equipped van to help physi-
cally challenged students
around campus, according to
Roberts.

“We also try to supply inter-

said.
Roberts is also on the

Committee which deals with
the accessibility of school
buildings for disabled stu-
dents. '

The office is helping more
students this term than ever
before. Nearly 75 percent of
these students have “hidden
disabilities” such as learning
disabilities or psychiatric
problems.

The office works together
with the student and the
instructor to provide the best
way for a disabled student to
learn, according to Roberts.

NCI coordinator of the trial and chief of
the NCI’s Community Oncology and
Rehabilitation Branch.

The BCPT has been evaluated by the
Steering Committee and the Endpoint
Review, Safety Monitoring and
Advisory Committee, both reporting to
the NCI and the NSABP; the Oncologic
Drugs Advisory Committee of the Food
and Drug Administration; the Senate
Cancer Coalition and two independent
NCI advisory boards.

According to the UPMC news bureau,
these agencies said the BCPT remains
scientifically valid and recommended
the trial continue.

The changes made included modifica-
tion of the protocol and consent form for
women entering the program.

The participants are now required to
undergo a sampling of the endometrium,
the inner lining of the uterus. This is to
increase the safety monitoring for partic-
ipants since an increased risk of
endometrial cancer has been linked with

These modifications were reviewed
and approved by the NCI and the FDA,
and then given to BCPT physicians and
coordinators responsible for entering
participants.

Although enrollment was halted, the
11,000 women already enrolled contin-
ued with their treatment and follow—up.
The study’s goal is to get a total of
16,000 women enrolled.

The study, which began in the spring
of 1992, targets women from age 35 and
older — randomly half receive tamox-
ifen and half receive a placebo. Neither
the doctors nor the participants know
who is receiving the tamoxifen.

“During the study hiatus, we have
received countless inquiries from
women across the country asking to be
evaluated for entry onto the BCPT,” said
Herberman.

Slavic bibliographer and cata-
loger of the university library
system.

Although the material is pri-
marily written in Polish, there
are many books written in
English. Included in the collec-
tion are books on the Polish lan-
guage, the history, music, art,
folklore, science, economics,
sociology, government, foreign
relations and the Polish experi-
ence in the United States.

The usefulness of the collec-
tion reaches beyond the students
at Pitt. Researchers come from

other universities to use this col- '

lection.

One researcher even came
from St. Petersburg, Russia, to
conduct his Polish research.

and her friends ran. As they mixed with
the crowd, they lost track of each other. As
police told the crowd to disperse,
Goodman said she ran around Schenley
Quad looking for her friends.

Police again called for the crowd to dis-
perse. At this point, Goodman said, she
and her friends were trying to get away
from the crowd.

“I do have a temper, I’m not gonna lie,”
Goodman said. But when police arrested
her and Chase, they used more force than
necessary, she said.

“I was thrown on the ground,” Goodman
said. “He said ‘cuff her tight.’ I had scars
from the handcuffs.”

Pittsburgh City Police arrested five Pitt
students, including Chase and Goodman.
Police said the students acted aggressively,
yelled profanities and disobeyed orders to
disperse, according to the May 11 issue of
The Pitt News.

Police charged the students with rioting,
obstructing administration of law, resisting

arrest, failing to disperse and disorderly
conduct. Police also charged Goodman
with two counts of aggravated assault.

The felony charges were eventually
dropped, but Goodman and Chase were
put on probation and must perform 175
hours of community service by January
1996. They were given community service
in exchange for the expungement of the
charges from their records.

But the FBI can find this on Chase’s
record when she applies for a job, she said.

“Anybody that really wants to can find
it,” Chase said. Chase said she might not
be able to work for the FBI because of that
spot on her record.

Neither Chase nor Goodman have decid-
ed where they will perform their commu-
nity service, but Goodman said she will
have difficulty when she has to call differ-
ent agencies to explain that she has to do
community service.

“Do---you know how embarrassing that
is?” she said.

Chase said she might work at a senior

citizens’ home. She doesn’t know what
she would do, but Chase and Goodman
said they want to do something challeng-
ing.

“I’m not sweeping anybody’s floor,”
Chase said.

“I didn’t think we should have to do
community service in the first place, but
the judge chose it,” Chase said.

“We are 100 percent innocent,”
Goodman said. “We were guilty of noth-
1ng.”

Goodman said she considered taking her
case to the American Civil Liberties Union
to file a civil lawsuit against the police
department, but the ACLU said it would
cost $25,000 just to file.

Also, filing a lawsuit with the ACLU
would be a long and frustrating process,
Goodman was told. So she and Chase
decided against it.

“It wasn’t on our minds anymore,”
Chase said. “We put it behind us.”

“... as much as we could,” Goodman
added.

“The advisor of the Polish

The Polish National Alliance,
the largest Polish fraternal orga-
nization in the United States,
founded the Alliance College in
1912 as a small liberal arts col-

IHE

Thirty years ago, British
bands like the Yardbirds, Van
Morrison’s Them and, of
course, The Who, were run-
ning around London playing
their hyped up versions of
Muddy Waters and Sonny Boy
Williamson songs that they
heard were so big in America.
To these people, that
Southern drawl, that deep, pri-
mal growl that permeated
blues music and the raw sexu-
al energy of the James Brown
and Otis Redding set crystal-
lized as an image of a cultural-
ly integrated, rebellious and
supercool “America" that did
not truly exist. At the same
time, with the rising visibility of
black, mostly West Indian
immigrants into England, the
magnetic mystery of black
music and culture became
highly attractive to the increas-
ingly bitter and disillusioned
young people of post—war
Britain. It is from this atmos-
phere that the Mod movement,
a style of life as much as of
dress and music, made
Voodoo dolls out of British
youth. Mods were frighteningly
obsessed with style: the stitch

 

of a jacket, the cut of the hair, 
the correct soul records at the ‘V

correct clubs.

It seems strange, in 1994, 

that four 20-odd-year-old kids
from Oakland, California
should latch on to the same
music, and much of the same
style, as this history book
fashion-trend of days long
gone and put out some of the
most spiritual and exciting
music in recent years.

The Loved Ones, with two
albums and a coupling of sin-
gles, mostly all on the
Hightone record label (the
ones responsible for the resur-
gence of guitar guru Dick
Dale), are a raucous, faithful
and viciously tireless R&B
quartet with more soul than
the entire remainder of the
Golden State combined. With
a strip-mined lineup of guitar,
bass, drums, vocals and har-
monica, their records create a
train-wreck of blues and
rhythm that seems live, even
after the hundredth listen.
Trying to get a soul-a—billy
explosion like “Jaguar Blues”
out of one’s head is like forget-
ting the chorus to “Blue Suede

The mod, mean rockers from Britain who call themselves THE LOVED ONES.

Shoes” —— the music is natural,

it's unalterably intrinsic to our
culture.

Live, the Loved Ones are a
barnstorming band, even more
energetic than on record, a
frenzy of guitar and mouth-
harp, with the steady pounding
of drums and bass keeping it
tied to the stage. Xan
McCurdy plays like John Lee
Hooker on too many diet pills,
his guitar sounding like an
entire blues army, bringing us
back to the early days of
Yardbird Jimmy Page. Pick
out the guitar players and
enthusiasts at a Loved Ones
show by whose eyes are
glued to McCurdy’s fingers.
Meanwhile, a look at Bart
Davenport’s stature is enough
to mislead one as to his vocal
prowess: the frog-voiced,

Wynonie Harris/Jimmy

‘Witherspoon sounds that his

unsure-seeming figure pro-
duces paint a portrait of a tried
and true blues man. Finally,
the stationary, resigned
appearance of Mike Therieau
belies an anchoring, vital bass
player and an ace songwriter,
while John Kent, complete
with Keith Moon haircut,
punches a smooth yet grinding
rhythm to swing to.

The Loved Ones certainly
won’t go winning awards for
originality and uniqueness.
That’s not important in this
field — R&B has, indeed,
been done, and done well.
What matters here is that this
is a band that is doing it bril-
liantly, and doing it now. Now.
The Now Sound of the Who’s
Maximum R&B, and the Now

Sound of the Loved Ones.
Two sides of a three decade
wide coin; the Mod explosion
of early ‘60s Britain never
made it to America. Why not?
Is it a reality that Americans
face and cannot forget?
Perhaps this is the reason for
a band like the Loved Ones.
Perhaps they allow for the
possibility of that idealistic
Mod image of America. They
deny all laws, they deny all
modern trends (the farthest
sound from grunge possible),
just as they would probably
deny any allegiance to their
British predecessors. Like Van
Morrison, the only important
thing is good music -- they
have no qualms about playing
three different Junior Wells
covers in one set. However,
the ties are there to the ‘60s
Mods; the use of music and
style to escape the hum-drum
of the modern world.

Thursday night at the
Decade, the perfect Loved
Ones setting, expect to hear
almost all of both Hightone
albums, as well as many
songs that any R&B fan will
know by heart, and probably a
scattering of unreleased origi-
nals, across two blazing sets.
The Loved Ones don’t get
tired, they’re the hardest work-
ing band in America.
Somehow, even in the ‘90s, a
bunch of white kids in
California grew up thinking
that a rock band has to work,
sweat and entertain like all
hell, and do it all with no atti-
tude included. What’s this
world coming to???

Those people wealthy
enough to afford the $50
admission price can attend a
major historical event at the
Andy Warhol Museum Theatre
this weekend, where John
Cale, Sterling Morrison and
Moe Tucker, of the legendary
Velvet Underground, will per-
form for two nights. The trio
will be playing new music to
accompany Warhol’s silent
films Eat and Kiss on Friday,
Nov. 18, and Saturday, Nov.
19, as well.

This will be the first time
these three musicians have
played live together in the
United States in 25 years.
Conspicuously absent from
this event will be Lou Reed,
who did perform with the oth-

T ers as the Velvet Underground

for the summer 1993
European tour. Apparently,
this gig will take place in lieu
(no pun intended) of the much
rumored Velvets reunion that

DULGTN EA

was to happen at the Warhol
Museum Opening last spring,
but was never brought to
fruition, reportedly due to diffi-
culties with Reed, the band’s
resident rock star.

So what have the other
three Velvets been up to late-
ly? in the past year, drummer
Maureen Tucker has released
two superb solo albums, with
all three of her former part-
ners, as well as indie super-
star Don Fleming of Gumball,
Violent Femmes bassist Brian
Ritchie and former Femmes
drummer Victor DeLorenzo,
among others contributing
their talents to those albums.
Tucker has also been touring
the country as a three-piece
band with Morrison and
DeLorenzo. Tucker’s sched-
uled gig at Rosebud last
month was cancelled due to
the truly unfortunate fact that
L7 was scheduled to perform
next door at Metropol the

same night, and would have
been too loud for Tucker's
show.

Original Velvets co-founder
John Cale has recorded sever-
al symphonic albums in recent
years, including the Last Day
on Earth concept album, with
Bob Neuwirth, earlier this year.
You may recall that Cale and
Reed reunited long enough to
record 1989's Songs for Dre//a
album, a tribute to Warhol.
Cale produced and played
most of the instruments on
Nico’s solo albums from the
‘80s, and also produced the
upcoming Siouxsie and the
Banshees album, whatever
that means.

Eat, filmed in 1964, was
intended as an homage to Pop
artist Robert lndiana, and is
basically 39 minutes worth of
Indiana eating one mushroom
in slow motion. Kiss (1963-64)
is actually 13 short films
shown consecutively, and

NOVEMBER 17 1994

     

Call this one the politics of decep-
tion. Although uncertainty remains as
to who pulled the plug on WPTS-FM’s
hosting of indie rock concerts, what’s
conclusive is that the radio station will
no longer host concerts for local and
national bands as it had in past years
—— and no student from WPTS made
the decision.

immediately following a Rancid and
Anti-Flag concert in Bellefield Hall on
Oct. 1, the station’s advisor Ron
Asbury issued a memo to promotions
director Nicki Mason that called for the
cancellation of all future WPTS spon-
sored concerts. What prompted the
decision is also debatable — Mason
said administration personnel made it
because they “were looking for a rea-
son to sweep us under the rug and
hide us from the university.” Asbury
said he and the DJs made it because
the station had strayed from its original
mission to simply be a radio station.
And Director of Student Activities Joe
Cavalla said he agreed with the deci-
sion but can not be held responsible for
making it.

At the Rancid show, two campus
police officers extinguished a three-
inch by five-inch American flag which
had been set on fire by a woman from
Ohio who did not attend Pitt. Public
Safety Director Rick Boyd said the only
problem caused by the incident was

COCOCOCOOOOOOOOOOOOCIOOOOOIOOOOIO

that it was a fire hazard. But Mason
said the incident was the third in the
last year to upset Pitt administration.
The first occurred in Benedum Hall last
March when a bassist threw his guitar
through a wall, vomit was found in a
trash can and cigarette butts were
swept from the floor. The second dealt
with a local promoter who was collect-
ing money improperly.

Station manager Adam Lewis said he
is not against the new policy. But he
said that on Oct. 3, Asbury handed a
memo to him and four other members
of WPTS’ student executive board. The
memo put into effect the anti-concert
policy, and it was only after the memo
was issued that Asbury asked the DJs
how they felt about it, Lewis said. “That
decision was made above the board
because we had no say in it. It was
issued via memo to us that that was it.
Period,” he said. And had WPTS DJs
made the decision, Lewis said they
would have notified him. “Any deci-
sions that come through DJs, i would
know of. So [the decision] came direct-
ly from Asbury and Cavalla — they are
the only two above me,” he said. “The
university feels that it is our job to run
the radio station and not to put on all
these shows.”

Three other DJs at WPTS have all
said the decision was made by the
administration, and two of those DJs

(as well as
Lewis) are on
the five-mem-
ber executive
board. Cavalla
adamanuy
denied the
assertion and
said, “l didn't
do it to WPTS,
nor did the
administration

It was a
decision made
by the execu-
tive board of WPTS along with their
advisor  I agree with the decision
because I am not too sure that their
purpose is to do concerts.”

Cavalla said he held a staff meeting
on Oct. 11 in which Asbury and
Campus Police Captain Tim Delaney
were in attendance. His staff discussed
“the concept of putting on concerts,” he
said. “We had a discussion at my staff
meeting to talk about concerts and
shows put on by a lot of these clubs
and organizations whose purpose it is
not to put on concerts and shows.”

Although Cavalla disputes any claim
that he made the decision, it is appar-
ent that his office has taken an active
interest in the future of WPTS-FM. In
addition, no student organization pro-
motes concerts and brings groups to

campus other than WPTS; thus, the
discussion’s focus of organizations
“whose purpose it is not to put on corn-
certs and shows” was WPTS. Delaney
said he was asked at the meeting if he
had any problems with the concerts,
and he said he did not. He said he only
expressed Campus Po|ice’s interest
that there be two officers at every
show.

Mason said that when the memo was

issued on Oct. 3, Asbury told her the
administration had been discussing the
decision for an extensive period of
time. She said the flag-burning inci-
dent, which caused no damage to the
hall or harm to audience members,

Killing Zoe
Written and Directed by Roger
Avary

Starring Eric Stoltz, Julie Delpy
and Jean-Hughes Anglade

For a film that tries to
achieve a ‘90s-style
Baudelairian decadence —
with AK—47s, ruthless bank
robbers and a thriving drug
culture, Killing Zoe could have
been an interesting and
engaging film. But this portrait
of irrationality quickly became
tiresome and cheap. The script
is far too obvious and simplis-
tic to take seriously: the char-
acters take a lot of drugs, rob
a bank and shoot a lot of peo-
ple in the head —-— with a
healthy sprinkle of lust thrown
in for fun. The film relentlessly
indulges in imagery of violence
and drug use, but unlike the
smart-as-hell Pulp Fiction,
Avary never elevates his mate-
rial above a conventional plot.
This time around it’s Puke
Fiction. '

A basic hostage flick told
from the vantage point of
some very dumb bad-asses,
Killing Zoe's main conflict
revolves around the juxtaposi-
tion between the two thieves
— the hedonistic Eric (Jean-
Hughes Anglade) and straight
boy Zed (Eric Stoltz), a conflict
which Zoe (Julie Delpy) is
cheaply used to resolve.

The Pitt Program Council

-These characters are especia —

     
 

ly cliché; Eric is the fearlessly
cracked leader of the gang,
while Zed just came along for
the ride because he and Eric
used to be friends, and he
remains aloof with college boy
reserve. .

The drug-induced jazz club
scenes, which drag on for
about a half hour, rely on gim-
micky camera stylization. The
focus is pulled, distorted and
re-established; the camera
spins, whirls and cants relent-
lessly; and a hodge-podge of
medium shots and sensual
close-ups are edited together
to give the illusion of heroin
use. Which is fun to watch,
certainly, but the direction of
the story frustratingly stops,
and viewers just want them to
rob the damn bank.

Also problematic about the
film is Eric’s role. The motiva-
tion for his actions are
unknown and his loose-can-
non personality comes off too
extreme to be believable, or at
least not to be ridiculous.
Eric’s graduation from robbing
mini-marts to wantonly shoot-
ing up banks is never
explained. He has no concern
for the future, and one can
only speculate that this is so
because he has AlDS -— he’s
gonna die anyway, so he’ll
take a whole bunch of punks
with him. But what’s most frus-

Avary put together a banal
script, hid it behind a few over-
the-topscenes and then tried
to pawn it off as a quality
netherworld portrait, when he,
working with Tarantino and
Lawrence Bender, could have
dropped some quality smut on
us. While highly watchable,
Avary’s pulp lacks the depth
he’s capable of presenting.

week. 381-2200

Clerks

Written and directed by Kevin
Smith

Starring Brian 0’ Halloran, Jeff
Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti
and Lisa Spoonauer

When watching Clerks, keep
the $27,575 budget in mind.
Remember that Randal (Jeff
Anderson) had no acting expe-
rience prior to the film. He was
just a high school buddy of
director Kevin Smith, 23, who
cashed in his comic book col-
lection one magazine at a time
for an extra $3,000. Given
these hindrances to produc-
tion, Smith deserves much
credit. lt’s appropriately hip, at
times funny, and has the
smart-aleck sensibilities of
Slacker. But what's not to be
applauded is Miramax’s bla-
tant utilization of the low bud-

minimal risk, to tap into the

The film was packaged ready-

Damn!!! it’s been a long time, but I'm
back. The pressures of beinga senior
are getting to be a burden. No matter.
This is one of my forums to speak hip
hop, and that’s what I’m here for. My
other forums are WPTS 92.1 FM on
Fridays at 9 p.m.

Another forum is Underground Hip
Hop Video Magazine on Mondays at
11 p.m. Speaking of which, the
Underground is starting to receive its
well-deserved props. In this month’s
The Source, is a full-page write-up on
the video show I boost so much (espe-
cially because I’m on it) in the Ear To
The Street section. Also, there is also

. going to be another write-up in Vibe

Magazine. From what I understand, it’s
going to be a little more extensive. It’s
going to be written by Kevin “The Real
World” Powell (?). l’Il keep you updat-
ed on that. We didn’t win the Billboard
award. That went to Ralph McDaniels
and the crew from Video Music Box in
New York. Congrats to them for keep-
ing things real.

Another forum will be my writings in
Urban Entertainment. I don’t know the
format for that yet, but from what I
understand, it’s supposed to be a lot
like this. l’Il inform you when the first
one drops. It's loot in the pocket for
doing something that I love. it’s all
good when it’s like that. I still have one,
possibly two, more union parties left in
this semester. The NSBE joint was fair-
ly successful, except for some bloopers
and that foul smell (which is the smell
of a blown speaker).

Quickly, before we jump into the
review, I wanna hit you with some
release dates. Redman is slated for
release on Nov. 22. Smif-n-Wessun
and Mad Lion are not due out until
January or February of 1995.
Funkmaster Flex is also due to drop
another single featuring Biz Markie
and others on a posse jam that has the
potential to be the strongest posse cut
of ‘95. Keep your eyes open for that.
For those that live in the New York
area and have heard the joint, “The
Dirty B-Side” with Da Brat, Jermaine
Dupri and Notorious B.I.G., it is slated
for limited release, but I don’t know
when. l’ll try to keep you up on that.
Since there's nothing else that I can
think of for the moment, let’s get down

This Man,” “Slow Down,” “Wake
Up” and many others set the crew by
the name of Brand Nubian into high
gear. With the departure of Grand
Puba and DJ Alamo, Sadat X and
Lord Jamar took their music to a dark-
er, more serious mindstate. Enter the
still-underground hit, “Punks Jump Up
To Get Beat Down,” and a few others
that came from a flopping album. Even
though Grand Puba and Alamo did
rejoin the group, they are not on this
album at all.

“Word Is Bond” is a hellafied way to
open an album; but that’s a false repre-
sentation of the feeling of the album.
The overall feeling of the album is dark,
angry; all-jokes-and-bullshit-aside in
other words. “Lick Dem
Muthaphuckas” first surfaced on the
Menace II Society soundtrack. With
the remix on this album, this song
takes a whole new persona. A bassline
with a very sturdy, crisp drum track and
a scratched hook (done by DJ
Sincere) sets the mood perfectly.
“Down For The Real” is an ill joint

steel

 

promoting guerilla warfare against the
devil and anyone who’s down with him.
“AIIadat” is Sadat’s solo joint with
Busta Rhymes going ballistic on the
hook. The subject matter is about men
and women who think they are the shit
when they are not. There are a couple
of others that catch the attention, such
as “Return Of The Dread,” “Step Into
The Cipher,” “What The Fuck,” and
“Sweatin’ Bullets.”

Even though the album is lyrically
sound, the music is no faster than 85
bpm. The album just drags through.
This is not characteristic of Brand
Nubian. On this album, they’re not flip-
pin’ it like they used to; it’s just not the
same. Maybe the tempos will speed up
when they cut the album with Puba.

I have to keep this relatively short.
Sorry, there will be no Starting 5 this

American Highway Flower
dada
l.R.S.

Someone once told me that
if I learned three chords, I
would be a guitar player. I
wondered who would believe
such a thing. Now I know that
they go by the name dada.

This same someone proba-
bly could invent some reason
to justify American Highway
Flower. I, on the other hand,
found this to be the most musi-
cally unoriginal, mundane
piece of work l’ve encountered
since I was traumatized by the
Gin Blossoms.

I suppose that even a band
like dada has influences, and
in this case they are about as
subtle as a Mack truck.
Apparently, dada grew up lis-
tening to the Police and the
Grateful Dead and liked them
a little more than what is
healthy for their musical

career. There is also some
strange I.R.S. sentimentality
going on in “All I Am,” which is
a frightening throwback to
R.E.M.’s I.Fl.S. days. I'm not a
supporter of record label inter-
vention, but someone really
should have prevented the
embarrassment involved in
recreating “Finest Worksong.”
Another one of dada’s influ-
ences would probably be the
band Extreme who, in case
you forgot, released that
ground-breaking Top 40
smash “More than Words" my
sophomore year in high
school. The only difference is
that I think dada is supposed
to be an “alternative” band.
You may be craving a more
scintillating analysis of the
music. No problem. Take three
run-of-the-mill musicians, per-
petual 4/4 drumming, a big fid-
dle bass line plus the occa-
sional harp, and ta da — dada.

ing, their lyrics are worse. I'm
not sure, but “Scum” is either
using Rush Limbaugh as a
catalyst for creative thought or
is saying that Rush is scum. In
any case, how Rush made the
cut I have no idea. “8 Track”
divulges their previously unex-
posed country music side (and
you thought dada was one-
dimensional). They moan,
“Baby's got an 8-track
mind/baby's got an 8-track
mind/and |’m number 9.” In
“Real Soon," dada sings, “I’m
gonna need somebody/I'm
gonna need somebody/Real
soon.” Oh, don't get too deep
on me now, kids.

When I say “dada sings,” I
mean they all sing. I have
never been hit over the head
with such irritating harmonics
since Music in Our Schools
Week. All I have to say is that
“fuck" really loses some of its
power when sung in three-part
harmony.

 

The point of all this is that
dada is playing at Metrocool
on Nov. 26, which would be a
Saturday. If you’re into long,
over-mixed, cliched songs,
knock yourself out. Based on
American Highway Flower, I
would avoid the Strip District
entirely. Somehow I doubt it,
but maybe they're better live.

I was instantly impressed
with Latimer’s Wor/d’s

some overly confident, bad
basement band trying to break
through to the big time. The
first song, “CaroIida,” made me
eat my expectations. These

“MTV’s Most Wanted." What
enthuses me most about
Latimer is that it gets right to
the point. “CaroIida” entranced
me from beginning to end. It
seized me with a superb open-
ing drum mix and tossed me
around with a cleaving electric
guitar. I needed an exorcist
after listening to this song.

World's Portable is fast,
loud and high-spirited. It's
good crowd music. I tried to
dance to “Good for Motion,”
but it was too intense and I
didn't have enough space in
my room. “Good for Motion”
moves rhythmically back and
forth; then it jerks into an elec-
trified spontaneity of strings,
drums and bass. “Diresque” is
one of the best songs on the
album. It has a certain seda-
tive/stimulant quality about it
that left me satisfied and con-
fused. Latimer can't sing. Their
voices consist of scratchy,
defiant, adolescent yells, but it
sounds good to me!

The best thing about Latimer
is that its sound is purely
inventive. Every song on the
album is worthy of greatness. I
predict that these guys will get
much radio play as soon as
they come out of the base-
ment.

day off, but ends up at work,
reading in the newspaper
about the engagement of his
ex-girlfriend from high school.
Randal (Jeff Anderson) and
his current girlfriend Veronica
(Marilyn Ghigliotti) are there
with Dante to joke, play hock-
ey and existentialize. Dante
plays the customer-appeasing
clerk, while Randal’s role is
more cutting and irreverent
toward the saps who walk into
his video store.

As for the film's merits,
Dante and Randal shoot off
enough rambling anecdotes
about past sexual partners and
Iooned out customers to be
entertaining, but then they
banter without much finesse.
Too much of this dialogue is
stilted to make us laugh.
People's sentences are always
spoken in their entirety, the
emotion is often forced and
Randal delivers an especially

so far removed from believable
chatter that we are reminded
he's reading from a script.

Other moments are more
laughable and enliven the
clumsy script: the man search-
ing for the perfect dozen eggs

Smith sold his comic book col-
lection), people searching for
the latest expiration date on
milk and video store" cus-
tomers who ask, “Do you got
that movie, about that guy, that
came out last year?” Other
than these anecdotes, the
script lacks a coherence other
than a day-in-the-life of plot
organization — in which all the
characters dwell in twen-
tysomething angst.

f e
Starring Kevin Costner, Elijah
Wood_and Lexi Randall

Anytime a movie can wet
your eye and raise your spirit,
it's worth the effort to go see it.
The War does all that, plus it
sends youhome with a slice of
morality.

Actually, it's quite obvious
that the film is preaching to
love thy neighbor; neverthe-
less, you leave the theater
wanting to embrace your worst
enemy.

The War is the story of a
father, recently returned from
Vietnam, who teaches his kids
the lessons he apparently
learned in battle: fighting isn’t
the answer and there is always
hope.

Writer Kathy Mcworter takes
you to the heart of depressed
Juliette, Miss., in 1970, where
the Simmons family is trying to

-’.-:-' :-:-.-'

   

get back on its feet after having
its home condemned.
Stephen Simmons (Kevin
Costner), the do-gooder father,
bounces around from one job
to the next because memories
of leaving his best friend to die
in Vietnam torment him and

kids show up; his sister Lidia
(Lexi Randall), who is the
family realist and narrates the
story; and" Lidia’s friends, two
black girls, who smoke and
periodically stop to teach Lidia
how to dance.

   

The title of the movie not

keep him from holding down

work.

Stu (Elijah Wood) idolizes his
father and is bent on building a
massive tree house that sym-
the
Simmons’ lost home. Stu is
constantly being beaten up by
the filthy Lipnicki kids for con-
trol of the tree house.‘ The
Lipnicki kids, whose father is
an enraged drunk, resemble
the Mongol horde of Genghis
Khan — destroying everything

bolically replaces

in their path.

Stu proceeds to the task of
building the tree house with
two overweight pals, who bail
on him whenever ‘the Lipnicki

only refers to Stephen’s strug-
gle with Vietnam, but also to
Stu and Lidia’s skirmishes
with the Lipnickies. Stephen
teaches Stu not to throw up

his fists every time somebody

gets “his dander up,” although
the exception to the rule
seems to be when fighting
results in another’s aid. in one
scene, Stephen refuses to
fight, even when Mr. Lipnicki
publicly humiliates him. Mr.
Lipnicki then goes after Stu
with a tire iron for sassing
him, and Stephen slams Mr.
Lipnicki to the ground saying,

“You touch my son, your

gonna push a button on me.”

back?

Although Asbury has said
the DJs approved the decision,
and Cavalla has said he did
not make the decision,’ it is
apparent that the executive
board did not make the deci-
sion. Members Lewis, Mason
and Paul Williams said the
decision was handed down to
them from Cavalla via Asbury,
who is a Student Activities
staff member.

Asbury said while the three
may not be happy with the
decision, they did approve it.
Asbury said they mistakenly
believe Cavalla made the deci-
sion because he issued the
memo eliminating the concerts
rather quickly. “It might have
been because right after that
incident occurred and I typed
up the memo instructing Nicki
to just go ahead just cancel all
future concerts, and then we
discussed it afterward. I think
maybe they might have
thought maybe I jumped the
gun,” he said. ‘‘I figure there's
no sense losing any more
money and losing any more
prestige.”

Bingo. It was immediately
following the Rancid show that
Asbury passed the memo to
Mason without her or any
executive board members’
approval. Two days later,
Asbury said he discussedthe

decision with Lewis, Mason.

and Williams, but the meeting

was irrelevant because a deci- g

sion had already been made.
Mason said she protested and
all Asbury told her was, “Come
up with a proposal and we will
go talk to Joe Cavalla and Dr.
Haley and try to work this out,”
she said.

When the October 3rd
memo was handed to Mason,
Lewis and Williams, the radio
station had two concerts that
were supposed to run in the
next week. Asbury said the
first show, on October 6th, did
run as scheduled because it
would have been too difficult to
cancel, but the show sched-
uled for the 10th was can-
celled. The haste with which
the decision was made raises
an important question: why
would WPTS eliminate a policy
which has stood for years in
two days (the Rancid show
occurred on Saturday and the
new policy went into effect
Monday)?

The fact remains that there
were no staff meetings at the
radio station on that weekend,
and Monday's memo was
issued without any input from
a WPTS DJ. Mason said she
began drafting a proposal
which she will present Asbury
and Cavalla so that the anti-
concert policy will be lifted,
but, logically, it seems incon-
ceivable that Mason would
approve a policy and a week
later begin fighting against it.

WPTS DJ and concert pro-
moter Bradley Simon said he
had promoted the Oct. 10
show, with The Queers, and
was told only days before the
concert that it was cancelled.

 
 
 
  

MBER 17 1994

‘‘It just came on me like three
days before I was supposed to
have the Rancid show.
Everything just started coming
down on me at the last minute,
it just started changing, so you
knew something was up,” he
said.

Asbury said the greatest
problem with WPTS sponsor-
ing the concerts is that they
run counter to the mission of
the radio station and that they
have tarnished the station’s
image. “Our original purpose is
to operate as a radio station
and not to promote bands,” he
said. “When it begins to reflect
upon our image within the uni-
versity, then I think it is time to
re-evaluate our thinking.”

Mason said she disagrees
with Asbury. One of the func-
tions of the radio station is to
promote concerts and bring in
indie rock bands for Pitt stu-
dents — bands which other-
wise may not appear in
Pittsburgh, she said. DJ Chuck
Van Keuran said the purpose

  
  

_r- 1 -.~ -.- 1'
.,.':. ;.-'

of a college radio station is to
serve the needs of the student
community, and WPTS fulfills
this role by bringing alternative
bands to campus. Because
the DJs know the music and
have the administrative skill to
coordinate a concert, no other
campus organization is better
suited to bring indie rock to Pitt
than WPTS. Mason said, “Pitt
Program Council brings in g
shows, but they are mostly
mainstream artists. We have
indie rock artists, and we deal
with Discesare-Engler and The
Next Big Thing who are willing
to work with us to co-sponsor
a show for groups that Pitt
Program Council knows noth-
ing about. They don't know
anything about Velocity Girl,
Superchunk or Sleepyhead.
And that’s where we come in.”
What is particularly repres-
sive about the policy is that the
shows were always all-ages,
and Pitt was the only venue to
provide alternative music on a
regular basis without an age

restriction. In a town with all
too many over-21 concerts,
WPTS consistently showcases
bands for a musically savvy
crowd that gets shut down at
most bars. As a result of the
new policy, the number of
bands that will appear in
Pittsburgh has been limited,
and it is more difficult for stu-
dents to attend shows. Scott
Dolin, a second-year Pitt stu-
dent who attended WPTS con-
certs, said there were never
any problems or fights at the
station’s shows. ‘‘I haven't wit-
nessed anything that could be
considered even remotely a
problem. Compared to any-
thing else, they are really
calm. People just come out to
hear music,” he said. And
because the bands are not as
well known as major label

acts, the audiences are usual-
ly smaller and more sedate
than a Metropol show, Dolin
said.

But for an organization that
bears the distinction of bring-
ing underground musicians
and/or international successes
such as L7, the Boredoms,
Cop Shoot Cop and
Sleepyhead to an all-ages
crowd, they've gotten no
respect. Still Cavalla denies
involvement in the decision
and said, ‘‘I am not trying to
subvert music here.” But clear-
ly, because a decision has
been made without the
approval from the student
members of WPTS’ executive
board, the silencing at
Bellefield Hall sounds like
subtle subversion.

, No school prayer

President Clinton is running scared. He announced yesterday his
willingness to work with the Republicans toward passing a consti-

schools. Though not a major issue in the elections, school prayer COMVLIQD \(s/{TH THe at/To at/\{s5.'oNs ’FeSTiNG

vigor.

Clinton is himself very religious and has long been in favor of
some forms of voluntary prayer, but the step toward a possible con-
stitutional amendment is an unprecedented move by the president.

The Supreme Court has consistently declared school prayer, in ,_ /, V

any form, to be unconstitutional. Therefore, to legalize school /“
prayer, a constitutional amendment is necessary. ‘IF ,_

School prayer has consistently been found not to be in the spirit
of our constitution. To alter it in this fashion would be an alteration
of the entire fabric of American democracy. It is the duty of parents
to instill religious sentiments into their children, not the govem-
ment’s.

Pirates are staying

The Pirates are staying in Pittsburgh, but maybe not in Three
Rivers Stadium. John J. Rigas, chairman of Adelphia
Communications, was selected Monday by the city ‘of Pittsburgh
to buy the club, Mayor Tom Murphy announced. “This is good
news for the city of Pittsburgh and good news for the Pirates,”
said Murphy. We heartily agree, the announcement that the
Pirates are staying will come as a relief to all Pirates fans and
baseball fans in Pittsburgh. The issue of whether or not the
Pirates will stay in Three Rivers is yet to be determined and will
be studied by the new owners.

A suggestion to the new owner would be to lower ticket

‘ prices. As part of the city’s new budget plan, the amusement tax

has been cut in half from 10 percent to 5 percent. However, it is
up to the Pittsburgh teams themselves to lower prices. It would
be a good gesture to the city by Rigas to "make one of his first
actions of business to lower prices equivalent to the decrease in
tax. Hopefully, the other Pittsburgh area sports teams will fol-
low suit, making it more affordable for us to support our city’s
sports teams.

We hope this good news will prove contagious and that the
baseball and hockey strikes will soon end. The Steelers are
great, but this isn’t a one-sport town.

CMU policy violates students’ rights

Carnegie-Mellon University
has decided to censor certain
computer bulletin boards which
contain sexually explicit materi-
al. It began restricting access to
these bulletin boards on Nov. 8.

The University of Pittsburgh
has officially supported
Carnegie-Mellon’s decision.

There are 81 bulletin boards
which will be eliminated,
although all bulletin boards
about sex will not be outlawed.
Some of the boards which will
be banned carry pictures, and
others are merely text files.

While I’m inclined to agree
with a Camegie-Mellon junior
that “if you need to read a board
to get turned on, there’s a clue
you need to get out more” -
nonetheless, censorship is cen-
sorship. What people want to
read on their own terminals is
their business. It’s probably bet-
ter that anyone engrossed in
these things is not out taking the

risk of propagating their genet- _

ics.

The real trouble is the
approach that is being taken by
members of the administration
at Camegie-Mellon. If this atti-
tude spills over to the adminis-
tration here at Pitt and at other
schools, things will get out of
hand.

Bill Arms, the vice-president
for computing services at
Camegie-Mellon was quoted in
The Tartan (CMU’s Newspaper)
as saying, “Responsible discus-
sion of sexual matters is very
important,” in explanation of
why all bulletin boards will not
be censored. The first question
is ‘who decides what is respon-
sible discussion?’ which is fine,
but common sense would dic-
tate what is responsible for most
people. The real problem is who
determines where conversation
can take place. Perhaps these
other boards contain or even
provoke responsible discussion.

Arms also said the action was

being taken because of a
Pennsylvania anti-pomography
ordinance. Now, these boards
violate this statute, but so do
some of the mass-mailings that
ﬂoat around in the e-mail boxes.
Will they have to start screening
personal accounts next? E-mail
would be the easiest way to get
around the ban. If someone
wanted sexually explicit materi-
al, and couldn’t get it here, you
could have someone e-mail it to
you from outside the system.
(Apparently, there is a pomo-

-graphic “Brady Bunch” script

ﬂoating around somewhere. It
never made it to television.) In
order to avoid this ﬂagrant vio-
lation of the law of the com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania, e-
mail would have to be screened.

The Internet is not in
Pennsylvania. It’s everywhere,
or nowhere. Who can regulate
what is allowed to ﬂow over it?
The rules would change every-
where. The question is whether
it’s the network’s location or the
user’s location that is important
in regulation.

Bill Arms also said, “I didn’t
feel it was necessary to discuss
this with the community
because there is no_need to dis-
cuss whether or not we should
obey the law” (The Tartan).

Laws are for the beneﬁt of the
community. Since they affect
the community, they ought to be
discussed by the community.
Blindly obeying the “the law”
simply because it is “the law” is
not justice; it’s social lem-
rriingism. It is worse to obey an
unjust law than to disregard it.

Edward Steinberg, the vice
provost for education at CMU,
said, “Our lawyers tell us that at
the moment we’re liable. If it
turns out we’re liable for other
things, we’ll have to take a look
at other things.”

Where does it end? First,
pornographic material is
banned. There is a lot of

counter-culture information
ﬂoating around in the electronic
ether. Someone once gave me
the instructions for building an
atom bomb downloaded off the
Internet. Is that next? The recipe
for a Molotov cocktail could do
more damage than a sex story,
so that type of board will proba-
bly be the next to go.

Although events like this raise
the spectre of an authoritarian
state, things like e-mail ensure
that any sort of crackdown
would be known about all over
the country, if not the world,
almost as soon as it happens.
Information can ﬂow very fast,
making it hard to censor any-
thing. This protection would be
lost if the delivery system itself
becomes restricted any further.
Too many people are already
excluded from this source of
information; let’s not exclude
anyone who’s already on it. The
only way anyone could seize the
networks for their own designs
without widespread panic is lit-
tle by little, one board at a time.

Probably the best way to deal
with these bulletin boards is to
just leave them alone. One
Carnegie—Mellon student told

me his curiosity was soon killed .

after looking at these boards
once.

Social stigma will keep this
kind of thing in check better
than laws. If people think they
are getting away with some-
thing, they will become more
deviant trying to break the law.

The business of higher educa- .

tion is to make people think, not
merely teach technical skills
based on the current demands of
the private sector. Give the stu-
dents unrestricted access to the
Internet and what’s on it. Let
good taste, not authoritarianism,
prevail.

based life form in an increasing-
ly silicon-based world.

meant more
to the

Columnist Panthers bas-
Sean ketball pro— A
Duncan gram than

anyone will
ever know.

It was a religious ceremony
in a sense. An exorcism — an
exorcism of ex-coach Paul
Evans’ demon.

The grim reality of Evans is
gone forever. The only time
you’ll see him is in night-
mares.

Sick, grotesque nightmares
like Vanderbilt’s Barry
Goheen’s three—pointer that
sunk the best Pitt team ever
assembled.

A 1988 team that featured
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane
and Demetreus Gore, that was
ousted from the NCAA tour-
nament prematurely.

That was with Paul the
Butcher.

Coach Ralph Willard is at
the helm now, and it shows.

No more ambivalence. No
more last-minute chokes. No
more underachieving, and
consequently, it makes a much
happier bunch of guys.

py people last year I think,”

guard Jason
Maile said. “It’s
more of a family ‘
thing this year. I
think everyone
loves it.
Everybody is
pulling togeth-
er.”

For the mem-
bers who played
under Evans, I
send my condo-
lences. But the
way Tuesday
night’s game
looked, they are
in for one hell
(no Evans pun
intended) of a
turnaround.

team, and they

enough heart and
enthusiasm to
put Evans into
shock.

The moping, pat each other
on the butt when someone gets
benched style is no longer en
vogue. No more lethal injec-

ager who suited up, the
Panthers somehow pulled off
the win.

“What I was looking for was

Willard said after the game.

game did they die. When they
got down at the end of the
game right at the end, they
found a way to come back and
win, and that’s what is really
important.”

Attitude, emotion and char-
acter seems very foreign,
especially in an exhibition
game against a team that’s
name resembles a gas station.

But those gas attendants
beat Pitt last year with a
healthy Jerry McCullough and
Eric Mobley. It’s pretty hard
to believe. Regardless that
Marathon Oil shot around 70
percent from the three-point
arc last year, the loss can only
be attributed to one person:
Paul Evans.

Evans had the uncanny abil-
ity to bring the absolute worst
in players by benching them
for taking a bad shot.

Not this year. Several times
during the course of the game,
players took bad shots and
turned the ball over. Instead of
sending them to the bench,
Willard shouted encouraging
comments and let them play.

Another change on Tuesday
happened in the pre—game
announcements —- the coach’s
name was announced. Yes, it’s
true. Things got so bad at the
end of last year that Evans’
name wasn’t announced in
fear he would catch a bowling
ball in the side of his head.

Brady of the Major
Slater L 6 a g “ 6

— B a s e b a l 1
strike, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette ’s coverage of last
week’s summit in Rye
Brook, N.Y., was despica-
ble.

On Thursday, Nov. 10, the
first day of the meetings, the
Post-Gazette’s only baseball
headline read: “Pirates sign
lefty Plesac, hope for good
experience.”

So, as the future of the
game hangs in the talks in
Rye Brook, the only base-
ball news the PG sees fit to
report is the Pirates’ signing
Dan Plesac. Nobody is big-
ger than the game, especial-
ly Dan Plesac.

Anybody relying on the
Post-Gazette for their sports
information wouldn’t have
even known the meetings
existed until Friday. That’s
when the PG ran a pagetwo

article on the Red Sox’s
John Harrington replacing
Richard Ravitch as the own-
ers’ chief negotiator.

On Saturday, there was a
little blurb in the Morning
Briefing section about the
owners’ setting a December
deadline for an agreement.
The PG wrapped up its
extensive coverage with
Tuesday’s Morning Briefing
blip about the owners
pulling their salary cap off
the table, breakthrough news
that appeared in the USA
Today on Monday.

One Associated Press
story and two wire bites on
what could end up being the
most important negotiating
sessions in baseball history?

And_ while the PG puts the
baseball strike on the back
burner, it runs NHL strike
stories almost daily, and
even has a reporter blanket-
ing NHL downtime.

Dave Molinari covered the
NHLPA’s patsy, no-check,
four—on-four tournament.
Yesterday, the PG ran a
story in which Molinari,
“spent a few days exploring
hockey towns in Canada to
find out how they’re surviv-

ing without the NHL.”

You mean to tell me the
PG doesn’t send a reporter
to Rye Brook, but sends
Molinari on a tour of
Canada to find out about the
strike-time welfare of a
bunch of Canucks?

They couldn’t feel any
worse than the Americans
whose national pastime is on
the line.

It must be that the PG
thinks it’s covering a real
hockey town.

Da Penguins bring da cup
ta da ‘Burgh, and all of a
sudden it’s a hockey town.

I grew up near Duluth,
Minn., I know what a hock-
ey town is.

Pittsburgh is not a hockey
town; Pittsburgh hockey
hinges on owner Howard
Baldwin’s wallet.

The PG should quell its
hockey town delusions and
start paying attention to
what matters.

Funderburk about to
break receiving records

By Matt Brody
Associate Sports Editor
The Daily Targum

Even though the defense
wasn’t there in last
Saturday’s 41-34 Scarlet
Knight football loss at
Virginia Tech, the offense
certainly came out to play.

Receiver Reggie
Funderburk broke several of
his own records, and inched
him closer to a 36-year-old
Rutgers record.

His seventh touchdown of
the season moved him into a
tie for second place on the
Rutgers all-time touchdown
reception list for a season.
His seven are two away from
Bob Simms, who set the
record in 1958.‘ He had a
career-high 11 catches, for
another career-best of 172
yards receiving.

He caught a 66-yard touch-
down pass from quarterback
Ray Lucas. “It’s sort of an
under route,” Funderburk
said.

“I’m reading the lineback-
ers and the safeties. I real-

- ized it was man coverage, so

once I went underneath  I
just came straight across. I
guess my man got picked off
or got lost somewhere, I
don’t know.”

He said he knew how the
defense would unfold
because of the positioning of
the safeties. V

“I read the safeties,” he
said. “Their safeties were

playing seven yards off the
line of scrimmage. When the
safeties are that close, you
know it’s some form of man.
And if it’s a man route, you
just keep it on the move. If it
was a zone, I would have
just stopped in the middle
and caught the ball.

“It was a designed play —
we had practiced it all week,
and it worked better than we
thought.”

Funderburk caught the
pass about 10 yards upfield,
and then found himself
almost alone —.—— there wasn’t
a soul within 15-20 yards of
the sophomore. As he neared
the goal, he needed just one
block, and it came from
another receiver, Jonathan
Gibbs.

Hepsaid it was a great
block, but added, “I didn’t
know which way he was
going to block it. Luckily, it
worked out.”

Rutgers used some less
frequently called-on plays on
offense, some of which
involved Funderburk lining
up in the backfield.

When he did, though, he
would go in motion and find
single coverage when he
would go deep.

Coach Doug Graber said
he was pleased with his
team’s offensive perfor-
mance. “We had 474 yards
on the offensive end. We did
some nice things.

“Both teams have an

The last hurrah
Piﬂ can play bowl-spoiler in seniors‘ last game

By Keith Pompey

‘ Senior Staff Writer

Normally, when teams
have losing records they
tend to go through the
motions when playing their
last game.

But the Panthers, who are
2-8 (1-5 in the Big East),
feel they have unfinished
business to attend to when
facing Rutgers (5—4—1, 2-3-
1) Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

“We just want to get that
last win to go out on a good
note,” linebacker Jason
Chavis said.

“Last week’s loss to
Miami reminds me of the
’ T e x a s
game. As
close as
we came
to winning
s o m e
games this
year, we really want to get
this last win.

“For us to win this last
game of the season will help
us out when preparing for
winter conditioning.

"‘Also, it is always nice to
win this’ last game for our
seniors, since Rutgers still
have a chance of going to a
bowl game.”

If the Panthers win the
season finale, the Scarlet
Knights can kiss a bowl
game goodbye.

“It will be fun to know
the team needs to beat you
to have a successful sea-
son,” safety David Sumner
said.

“There is nothing better
than preventing a team from
attaining their goal.”

 

 

Senior defensive end Tom Barndt leads the Panthers with ﬁve and a half sacks this season. c
He has been named a tri-captain, along with Reuben Brown and Lawson Mollica for Saturday.

For Pitt to complete their
mission, they must con-
tain two offensive threats in
Ray Lucas and Terrell
Willis.

Lucas, a 6-foot-3-inch,
200-pound quarterback,
has completed 135 of 229
passes for 1,651 yards to go
with 15 touchdowns this
season.

As a result of this, he is
ranked third in the confer-
ence in passing efficiency
with 133.27 points.

pound sophomore, is
currently ranked third in
the conference with an
average of 94 yards a
game.

Last season, he was named
the Big East Rookie of the
Year.

“If we stop those two
the game is ours,” said
Sumner. “I am 100 percent
sure we can stop them.
Last year we went up
against [the two] and they
didn’t do anything. This
year we are a better defen-
sive unit.”

But while the Panthers try
to put a stop to Willis, they
are hoping Billy West has a
field day.

So far this season, the
sophomore tailback leads
the Big East Conference in
rushing with 1,170 yards,
ranking him seventh on
Pitt’s all-time single-season
list.

If West rushes for 113
yards or more this game,
he will have the fifth-best
rushing season in Pitt histo-
ry.

His current average of 117
yards a game is ranked 13th
in the country, and he leads
the team with five touch-
downs.

Other Panthers to watch
out for are seniors Reuben
Brown, Tom Barndt and
Lawson Mollica.

On Tuesday, these three
players were selected by
their teammates to serve as
the game captains in their
final game wearing a Pitt
uniform. »

“All three players
are excellent football
players and superb leaders,”
Pitt coach Johnny Majors

-Barndt, a 6-4, 275-pound
defensive end from Mentor,
Ohio, has led Pitt in sacks
the last two seasons. This
year he has racked up a team
high five and a half sacks.
He also returned a blocked
punt 53 yards for a touch-
down.

Brown, a 6-4, 295-pound
offensive tackle from
Lynchburg, Va., leads the
team with 69 intimidation
blocks. Brown, who has
been a standout offensive
lineman the past four years,
recorded 14 intimidation

blocks against the
University of Miami
defense. ,

consistent lineman in recent
years. After being switched

Rutgers takes its show on
the road one last time this
season as the Scarlet Knights
come to Pitt Stadium
Saturday for the season
finale for both clubs.

Rutgers (5-4-1 overall, 2-
3-1 in the Big East) brings
with it an offense that is
averaging 22 points, along
with 373 yards of total
offense, a game. Rutgers dis-
tributes its wealth evenly by
averaging 177.5 yards rush-
ing and 195 yards passing
per game.

season while scoring three

touchdowns. He is averaging

Year in 1992.

The most potent aspect of
the Scarlet Knight offense is
the receiving corps. Led by
tight end Marco
Battaglia and sophomore
Reggie Funderburk, the
Rutgers air attack has
amassed 1,955 yards this
season.

Battaglia leads the confer-
ence in receptions per game
with 5.0 and is third with
67.9 receiving yards per
game. He has 50 receptions
for 679 yards and four touch-

Battaglia had his best out-
ings this season against
Boston ‘College, when he
caught eight passes for 102
yards and one touchdown,
and six catches for 110 yards
and two scores against
Virginia Tech. ESPN draft
expert Mel Kiper has tabbed
him as the number one tight
end for the 1996 NFL draft.

Funderburk leads all Big

touchdowns on the year. He
has 47 receptions for 647

thrown for 1,651 yards,
which ranks him third in the

conference.

He barely threw for 1,000
last year.

Graber also feels that they
were running against less
than stellar competition.

“We had some huge num-
bers against poor defenses,”
he said.

The two racked up big
numbers against Duke,
Colgate, Temple and Army.
None of these teams are
known for their strong defen-
sive units.

And despite the fact that
the Scarlet Knights put up
such huge numbers last year,
they still finished the season
at 4-7.

This season the statistics
are not as gaudy, but the

team’s overall record stands
at 5-4-1.

“We’ve been in a lot of
close games,” Graber said.
“We’ve had some tough road
losses.”

But recently, the offense
has begun to turn things
around.

“Our offense is beginning
to do pretty well,” Graber
said

“We can play well if every-
one is healthy.”

Besides Presley, the team
is essentially healthy, and on
a roll. The Scarlet Knights
have won three of the last
five games.

Along the way, they tied
Boston College and lost to
No. ll Virginia Tech in a 41-
34 thriller.

It should be no surprise
that the running attack is the

force behind Rutgers’ latest
success.

“Terrell Willis is really
coming on now,” Graber
said.

On Nov. 5, Willis was
named the Big East
Offensive Player of the Week
for his school-record 232
yards against Temple.

And before the BC game,
Presley was coming to form
as he had rushed for over
100 yards in back-to-back
games against Army and
Cincinnati.

Saturday against Pitt,
Willis will take most of the
carries.

“Presley is out, and is
probably done for the sea-
son,” Graber said.

“But I have no doubt that

Terrell Willis will get the job
done?’

explosive offense,” Graber
said.

“It was who could outscore
who.”

But Rutgers did not do the
outscoring on this day, and it
may have cost the team a
bowl bid.

Funderburk attributed this
to some mistakes on offense.

“We thought we moved the
ball pretty well,” he said,
“but there were certain situa-
tions where we had to make
the big play, and maybe we
didn’t. The defense was
struggling all day — this was
a very tough game for them.”

ence.

Against Virginia
Tech, Funderburk had
11 catches for 172
yards, both career
highs. He also excels
as a hard—nosed down-
field blocker for the
Scarlet Knights.

The number three
target for Lucas is red-
shirt freshman Steve
Harper. He has caught
17 passes for 242 yards
and two Scores. He
leads the team with
14.2 yards per catch.

Leading an experi-
enced offensive line is
senior tackle Ken
Dammann. He has the
longest starting streak
of any current Rutgers
player, with 25 starts
over three years.
Dammann has been in
the Starting line—up 34
of the last 35 games for
the Scarlet Knights.

“He’s playing consis-
tently at a very high
level,” Graber said.
“He’s got to be one of
the best around. He is
quietly playing better
than any offensive
tackle we’ve had since
I’ve been here.”

The only area where
Rutgers does not excel
offensively is in the
kicking game. Senior

‘ Eddie Duborg is 25-28
for points after touch-
downs but is only 5-10
at field goals.
