Pitt ceremony

By Gary Knapick

The sky wasn’t all that was
trying to rain on Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O’_Connor’s parade last
Friday.

Protests of several kinds took
place throughout the day, as a
variety of organizations and
individuals attempted to draw
attention to a number of

grievances surrounding the
installation and administration
of the chancellor.

A boycott of the installation
ceremony by former black-
studies department Chairperson
Dennis Brutus was indicative of
discontent over the cost of the
ceremony.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor thanked his family for their support.

O’Connor stresses Pitt’s future

Byjulie Sabol T

Asst. News Editor

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor invited students,
faculty and guests to join him on

.a journey as he was officially

installed as the 16th Chancellor
of the University of Pittsburgh
on Friday in the Carnegie Music
Hall.

journeying from the eighth
century to the future of the 21st
century, O’Connor described the
changes that have and that will
take place in the academic world
of schools with tradition, which
he called “cathedral schools.”
He then focused specifically on
Pitt and the new directions it
would be taking into the next
century. O’Connor emphasized
how he has listened to the
concerns that have been brought
to him. He assured the audience,
“Together we are taking action.”

O’Connor said the budget
policies have been restructured
so that they come from the
bottom of the university structure
to the top. A five—year plan to

enhance and innovate
classrooms, lecture halls and
computing laboratories is now
underway as well as a substantial
increase for financial support of
the library system.

The installation ceremony
began with an academic
procession featuring presidents
from other colleges and
universities, presidents from
Pitt’s regional campuses and
members of the Pitt community,
including deans, directors,
faculty and administrators.

All of the participants were
dressed in academic robes and
walked from The Carnegie’s
Dinosaur I-lall through the Hall
of Sculpture to the Music Hall.

The official ceremony opened
with commendations to
O’Connor from a variety of
colleagues and dignitaries,
including Pittsburgh Mayor
Sophie Masloff and Robert
Rosenzweig, the president of
the Association of American
Universities.

A written message from
President George Bush to

O’Connor was read to the crowd.

“By your example, Pitt
students will know that through
hard work they can make a
difference in the world. Your
role is an important one, but I
am confident that you are up for
the challenge. Barbara joins me
in sending best, wishes,” Bush
wrote.

Gov. Robert Casey also sent a
commendation to O’Connor
expressing the pride
Pennsylvania has in the
University ofPitLsburgh and the
new administration.

Masloff, who spoke on behalf
of'the city of Pittsburgh, said,
“At my initial meeting with
[O’Connor] less than six months
ago, I knew the relationship
between the city and the
university was bound to prosper
due to his leadership  The city
of Pittsburgh is very happy to
officially welcome you to our
community.”

After an interlude by the lleinz
Chapel Choir, Provost Donald
Henderson placed the

 Trustees amend bylaws to a’z'z/erszfy boara’ members/oip

By Megan Bertino
News Editor

Pitt’s Board of Trustees has amended it’s
bylaws to create greater diversity on the
board and foster better communication
between trustees during their spring
meeting on Friday.

“The underlying philosophy behind the
changes is to make the board better
informed of university business and more
representative of the university and the
general community,” Farrell Rubenstein,
chair of the ad hoc committee on the

board’s structure and operations, said.
The board voted unanimously to pass
the resolutions proposed by the committee.
Under the new amendments, the board
will work to change its composition more
frequently. The trustees said they will also
work to diversify the board by adding
more women and minority trustees to
make it more representative of the
universityand the surrounding community.
Prospective candidates will be reviewed
more vigorously before being evaluated
by the board for confirmation, and existing
members will be evaluated based on

attendance, participation and overall
participation.

In addition, greater steps will be taken to
keep trustees better informed of the

activities of‘ their committees,’ including’ .

written reports submitted in advance of
BOT meetings rather than oral reports
during the meeting.‘

The number of charter trustees who
have unlimited terms was reduced from 12
to eight.

BOT committees will make a greater
effort to include input from faculty, staff
and students and members of the

community.

The tenure of the BOT chairperson,

which was previously unlimited, will be
restricted to five consecutive one-year
terms. ' . ‘T r i '
In response to student trustee Paul
Chappano’s request that BOT bylaws
mandate there always be a student
appointed to the board, Rubenstein said,
“There was a consensus of the committee
that it be rejected  [I] could not get any
support for that position."

State Rep. Mike Fisher said he agreed

Yale prof says humanities face uncertain future

By Michael King
and Christine Hanna
The Pitt News

The humanities face an
uncertain future due to the
recession, according to Yale
literature Professor Peter
Brooks. A

“To be asked to speak of the
future Ofhumanities at the present
moment may be like being asked
about the future of the wooly
mammoth at the onset of the ice
age,” said Brooks, who spoke on
a humanities panel as part
of the week—long installation
events.

Other panelists included Pitt
Professor John Beverley of the
department ofl lispanic languages
and literatures; Pitt Professor Paul
Bove of the linglish department;
Assistant Professor Helena
Goscilo, chairperson of Pitt's
Slavic languages and literatures
department; Pitt Professor Gerald
Massey, director of the Center for
Philosophy of Science; and
English Distinguished Professor
Albert Labriola of Duquesne

University.

The speakers were moderated
by Pitt professor offine arts Allison
Stone.

Brooks said the recession is
spreading beyond economic
issues.

“At economic hard times like
the present, humanities are
thought to be soft and
dispensable,” Brooks said.

Despite the concern for the
future ofhumanities, Brooks said
the United States is still a world
leader in humanistic pursuits.

I le called the humanities in this
country “a democratic market with
competition to publish.”

Brooks, the author of Reading
for the Plot and A New Ilistovjy of
lirerzc/9 Literature, said the study
of humanities is often
wrongly associated with a social
elite.

“Humanities was most
personified by the humanists of
the Renaissance, who wrote
imitations of the Greek and Latin
masters  reworking the lessons
they have learned in their Own
works,” Brooks said.

He said the preservation of the
wisdom of the past is the basis of
the humanities.

Stone said the ratio between
men and women faculty must
change, citing disparity in the
chemistry (26 men, no women),
economics (_ 26 men, two women),
math (41 men, three women) and
physics and astronomy
departments (/10 men, two
women). ,

Only the German department
has more women teaching than
men.

Beverley said the United States

_is the fifth-largest Spanish-

speaking country in the
world, and by the end of the
century, it could be the fourth-
largest.

According to Beverley, by 2076
the world may consist of non-
western multiculturalism. “Where
we are today is at the beginning
of exploration of consequences,”
Beverley said.

Goscilon said instead of just
emphasizing the three original
R’s, the university should educate
in ritual, rhetoric, reason and

responsibility.

Throughout her presentation
she put her four R’s into the
perspective of J. Dennis
O’Connor’s installation as
chancellor.

Goscilo said there is not much
to celebrate, but to mourn. She
said the installation would be
either “nOvelle cuisine or
starvation” to the university.

Goscilo said she feels like a
child when asking for money to
Xerox papers for her students.

Massey said, “You cannot just
concern yourself with text. One
needs to look at the book of the
world.”

Massey said there is a lot of
science involved in humanities.
“There must be an involvement
and interaction with the sciences,
especially biological. That is
where the action is.”

Stone said the latest technology
will transform the humanities field
in the future. Now humanists
must look beyond to the social
sciences, she said.

Bove said humanistic educators

Akbar points blame of gender r

roles of blacks on White men

By Maria Muzzie
Sta_17' Writer

The white male—dominated
American society is responsible
for problems between black
males and females, according to
Dr. Dawud Akbar.

White American males are
projecting their sexual hang—ups
onto black society, said Akbar,
who spoke at the Black Action
Society’s BASICS Workshop.

“It is not white females who
are running this society. It is
white males. We are assimilating
the male chauvinism of the
American patriarchy,” saidAkbar,
a clinical psychologist. “They
think men’s muscle and might
make them superior. That’s not
how it happened in Africa. We
had rulers who were sisters.
African men didn’t have ego
problems.”

Akbar said African Americans
must understand that they have

« inherited these attitudes from the

days of slavery and that this
“slavery imprinting” is responsible
for the growing problem in the
black community of fathers
sexually abusing their young
daughters. It was common for

 

slave masters to force young slave
girls to have sex with family
members for breeding purposes,
Akbar said.

Akbar said white America is
preoccupied with the flesh.

“The flesh has
bondage. Why do men rape? They
associate flesh with woman and
woman with evil. Is that the way
it was in Africa? H-e—l—l no. That's
the way it is in America,” he said.

“I see young ladies wanting to
have babies and young men
grabbing their genitals. If we
maintain this infant mentality, they
will end up in the penitentiary,”
Akbar added.

The reason African Americans
are’ still suffering is they are
operating out of the value system
of white-male America, Akbar
said. In order to end this suffering,
people must understand that the
body is only a shell and that the
real self is the spiritual self,
according to Akbar.

“We have to realize that our
collective survival is more
important than the individual,”
Akbar said. “To look into the
individual you see the group,
and to look into the group you
see the individual.”

PSfP, local groups sage /aomssez/en

By Lisa Restivo
For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh Students for Peace
rallied with five local human-
services agencies to raise
awareness about hunger,
housing, mental-health services
and health care at the
performance/sleep—out festival
“Leap into Action” Saturday
night on the William Pitt Union
lawn.

According to PSfP member
Cassi Geirer, the event served
as a reminder of the homeless
problem.

“Quite often, in working for
peace in distant corners of the
world, we forget about
problems in our own back
yard,” Geirer said.

Folk singer Anne Feeney
kicked off the event by singing
about issues from children’s
hunger to health insurance.
Musical performances,
performance poetry, comedy
and an open stage for former
homeless people to showcase
their talents followed the rally.

of Street Beat, which features
literary works by homeless
people, joined 15 others in

Mc(lafferty said she wrote her first story when she

a divorced family who was fascinated with her
Italian neighbors, who had such a large family. “I
really liked the act of writing the story,” she said.

At the University of Delaware, McCafferty

University Glee Club
has diverse abilities

By Jennifer N. Spagnuolo
For the Pill News

With last season being Pitt football’s 100th season, students
might be tempted to label it the university’s oldest student
organization. Performing on-campus since 1890, however, the
Pitt Men’s Glee Club has stood the test of time just a bit longer.

The 23-member a cappella group sings anything from
barbershop to baroque, classical to contemporary and spirituals.
The group is occasionally joined by accompanist Beth Kovaly.
A soloist is chosen by audition to help with certain songs.

Once a semester the Glee Club travels to various women’s
colleges with the goal “to harmonize in four parts with the
women,” Glee Club President Rich Koval said. In addition to the
trip, the men tour at the end of every Spring term.

In 1990 they went to Europe. In 1991 they went to Chicago
and sang at a White Sox game. In 1992 they will be going to
Atlanta with the Pitt/Atlanta Club to sing at an Atlanta Braves
game. These trips “provide an opportunity for the members to
get to know each other better,” Koval said.

On campus, the Glee Club has sung at many university affairs,
including Alumni Association gatherings. The men have also
sung with the Women’s Chorale Ensemble. On March 5 the
group will sing the National Anthem before the last home game
of Pitt’s men’s basketball season.

Director of the Glee Club Greg Scheer joined the club when
it went on tour to Chicago lastyear. He is a graduate student in
music and was selected as director by the music department.
Scheer has written some of his own music in the past and has
arranged a version of “Come Together” by the Beatles for the
upcoming 102nd Annual Spring Concert. The free concert will
be held in the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium on Sunday, April 5,
at 3 p.m.

agreed to participate in the event
he was unaware that the
installation would cost the
university $92,000.

“I cannot in good conscience
participate in what I regard as an
inexcusable extravagance. I
believe the money could be better
spent in services for the students,”
Brutus said.

About 20 protestors from the
nationwide gay, lesbian and
bisexual activist group, Queer
Nation, picketed in front of
Carnegie Music Hall during the
installation. Members of the group
from Pitt, Chatham College and
Carnegie Mellon protested
O’Connor's decision to allow
ROTC to remain on campus
despite the Department of
Defense’s regulations, which
discriminate against gays, lesbians
and bisexuals and violate Pitt’s
anti-discrimination policy.

“’Ihis is a direct action to protest
homophobia and bigotry," said
Matthew Kittredge, who
organized the protest.

“'I'o admit that llhe l)ol)’s
policyl is wrong and that it violates
the anti-discrimination policy of
the school and not do anything is
ridiculous,” Kittredge said.

PSfP member Cassi Geier said
she is one such student.

“I wanted to come back to Pitt
this term, but I couldn’t afford it.
Out of this $92,000 could have
been my tuition. It just isn’t fair,”

.Geier said.

Pitt custodians from Local 29 of
the Maintenance Workers Union
were also present to express their
discontent with the progress of
their contract negotiations with
the university.

Pitt is offering the custodians a
raise of 20 cents per hour over
the next four years.

In addition, the custodians said
the university is trying to make
them switch to a health—care plan
that is more affordable for the
university but which will raise
the workers’ deductible from
almost nothing to $1,500.

“'I‘hey’re trying to give us a
two—percent raise. T hey’re taking
away our benefits. That’s a shame,
man,” said I-lazen Burton, who
handed out leaflets and turned
heads with a hand-held public-
address system.

“Instead of giving us a raise,
they’re throwing a party for all
the snobs in town,” Pitt custodian
Mike Walsh said, referring to the
guests entering the student union.

James Headings of Edgewood
staged a one—man picket march
around Oakland on Thursday and
Friday “to protest the university’s
$90,000 coronation
extravagance.”  A

Headings held a sign asking
O’Connor if he wanted a crown
for his “coronation.”

“Many of us were hoping for a

change of tone after Posvar, and.

it appears that we’re not getting
this change,” Headings said.

Miller emphasized the
importance of using politics
to combat hunger and
economic injustices. “The
legacy of Reagan/Bush
economics has not helped.
Minimum wage isn’t enough
to raise a family of four up
to the poverty level,” Miller
added.

According to PSfP
President Erin Bush, the

protest the war in the Persian
Gulf last November.

“During the war we had a
food drive and collected
canned food because of the
money diverted from social

' needs by the Department of

Bush said. Bush said human-

still put into defense.

“I think it’s wrong that last

$10 million and Carnegie
Mellon’s Software Engineer

in 1991 alone, while the
state closed Woodville

a lack of funds,” she said.

Katz said Street Beat is an

Board passes changes
to Pitt athletic policies

 

The Board of Trustees’ Ad Hoc
Committee on Athletics at Pitt
presented its proposal during
Friday’s meeting for changes in
the departrnentbased on the 1991
Knight Foundation Report,
“Keeping Faith with the Student-
Athlete: A New Model for
Intercollegiate Athletics,” which
called for new standards for
college athletes.

Chair of the committee Eugene
Barone presented the proposal,
which was passed unopposed by
the board. The new guidelines
for the athletic department are as
follows:

-The educational values,
practices and mission of this
university determine the
standards of conduct in the
intercollegiate athletics program.

-The responsibility and
authority for the administration
of the athletics department,
including all policies, personnel
and finances, will be with the
chancellor of the university.

-The welfare, health and safety
of student-athletes are primarily
concerns of athletics
administration on this campus.
Pitt will provide student-athletes
with opportunities for academic
experience as close as possible
to those of their classmates;

- Every student, whether male,

female, minority or majority, will -

receive equal and fair treatment.

-The admission of student-
athletes will be based on their
showing reasonable promise of
being successful in a course of
study leading to an academic
degree.

°Continuing eligibility in
intercollegiate athletics will be
based on students’ being able to
demonstrate each academic term
that they will graduate within five
years of enrolling.

have spent comparable time as

-All funds raised and spent in
connection with intercollegiate
athletics will be channeled
through the university’s general
treasury, not though independent
groups, whether internal or
external. The athletic budget will
be developed and monitored in
accordance with general
budgeting procedures on campus.

-All athletics—related income
from non—university sources for
coaches and athletics administers
will be reviewed and approved
by the university.

-The university will conduct
annual academic and fiscal audits
of the athletic department.
Moreover, the university intends
to seek NCAA certiﬁcation that
the athletics program complies
with the principles herein. The
university will promptly correct
any deficiencies and will conduct
its athletics program in a manner
worthy of this distinction.

with Chappano that the position be maintained,
and it was decided that the issue would be
discussed at the board's next meeting.

Trustee Frank Mosier reported on the
resolutions of the BOT Affirmative Action
Committee, which mandated the university take
positive steps toward achieving diversity in the
racial, ethnic and gender compositions of its

work force at all levels; enhance opportunities‘

for enrolling, retaining and graduating students
from underrepresented groups; provide
accessibility and accommodations to individuals
with disabilities; create a campus environment
free of bigotry and harassment and engage
minority and women—owned business and
vendors or suppliers. The board passed all
afflrmative—action mandates.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor told the
trustees that the $5.8 million budget cut the
university will receive for fiscal year 1993 will not
affect the academic department at Pitt.

“We have been able to absorb that reserve,”
O’Connor said, but he did discuss the possibility
of a 6—percent tuition increase for students.

The board passed the ﬁnal proposal for the
transfer of Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic from Pitt to Presbyterian University Hospital.
Presby will now be responsible for overseeing
the hospital.

Currently, WPIC is owned by the state, but it
is leased to the university. Under the new plan,

Presby will sublease WPIC from Pitt. WPIC .

employees will become Presby employees.
Adjustments will be made to WPIC employee's
benefits packages to make them consistent with
Presby benefits, particularly allowing for tuition
remission for dependants of WPIC employees.

Pitt and Presby also agreed to regularly evaluate
the academic and clinical work at WPIC. Ifat any
time the university or Presby should decide to
terminate the sublease, then the governance of
all WPIC operations becomes the responsibility
of Pitt.

New appointee for Vice Chancellor ofAlumni
Affairs Lawrence M. Weber was confirmed.

“Mr. Weber, president of Ketchum, Inc., brings
to Pitt an outstanding record of expertise and
accomplishment in institutional fund raising and
advancement  He has directed a number of
successful fun_d—raising campaigns and provided
counsel to more than 20 of the nation’s‘major
universities and colleges,” O’Connor said.

William G. Laird, chief financial officer of '

Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic was
appointed to the position of controller and
assistant treasurer of the university.

In addition, the title ofpresident ofthe university _

was officially changed to chancellor at the
request of O’Connor.

Shake up at the top

Last Friday, the University of Pittsburgh's Board of
Trustees approved structural and operational changes to
reﬂect the so-called “new era of openness” sweeping our
great institution.

For the past year or two (or three, or maybe even

longer), the university's decision-makers have been

accused of being asleep at the wheel.

_ Last May the Board of Trustees faced this criticism over
internal policy. It was embroiled in scandal over the perks
allocated to outgoing Pitt President Wesley Posvar. Trouble

- erupted when hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of

benefits went to Posvar without the full knowledge of the
board.

Since that time, an internal committee has been reviewing
board ‘policy and structure. At Friday’s Board of Trustees
meeting, the recommendations were unanimously
approved.

Farrell Rubenstein of the BO’I"s Ad Iloc Committee on
the Structure and Operation of the Board commented,
“The underlying philosophy behind the changes is to
make the board better informed ofthe university business
and more representative of the university and the general
community.”

ljnder the new amendments, the board will work to
change its composition more frequently. Board chairs will
be limited. Committees will work to incorporate various
campus interests.

’l'he trustees will also work to diversify the board by
adding more women and minority trustees to make it
more representative ofthe university and the surrounding
community.

In an attempt to put on a diverse face, the visually
heterosexual, white, male majority on the board agreed to
attempt to broaden the ranks by race, gender and age. It
was particularly insightful for the board to take a good
look at its composition. This pointcould not be emphasized
enough: Mandatory gender parity on the board should be
in place by the end of the decade. As well, the board must
ensure greater participation for African-Arnerican, Asian-
American and Ilispanic peoples.

Unfortunately, our new era of openness will only go so
far. Rubenstein dealt a blow to students.

Paul Chappano, the only student trustee, suggested that
BOT bylaws mandate that a student must serve on the
board. Rubenstein said, “There was a consensus of the
committee that it be rejected  lll could not get any
support for that position.”

Our board must have student representation. In fact,

student representation should exceed one student trustee. .

I t would be possible for university students to be selected
as board representatives in the same manner as all
applicants.

At least I() percent of the board seats should be reserved
for students and faculty to ensure greater participation
from the university constituents. Of the 1() percent, three
seats must be reserved for students.

If a real era of openness is on the horizon, the board will
take appropriate action rather than make statements soon
to be forgotten.

Japan-baiting masks America’s Woes

What’s with all of the complaining? Every time I
watch more than 20 minutes of television, I hear
someone complaining about what someone else in
Japan said or did concerning someone or something
in the United States. I personally wish my life were
carefree enough to allow me to get angry over what
someone that I’ll never meet says about me. I keep
seeing these person-on-the-street interviews that
tend to go something like this:

Reporter: “Did you hear the

competition. Most Americans don’t own car
companies, and in the board rooms, the companies
consider themselves global entities. So as long as
the company is putting Americans to work, it
shouldn’t matter who you buy a car from.
George Bush is another person abusingJapanese—
bashing. He wants to look concerned until hecan
find another dictator to hunt down. I realize that
most of us can’t remember a time when we didn’t
officially hate someone, but if

prime minister of Japan’s
comments?”
Person: “Yeah.”
R: “What did you think of them?”
P: “It pisses me off. Them

John
Day

America buys into this anti-Japan
attitude, it runs the risk of slipping
into an anti-Japanese — or worse,
an anti-Asian — mentality. This is
not only damaging to long—term

Japanese got a lotta nerve, saying
that we are lazy and illiterate. Being lazy and
illiterate didn’t win World War II!”

R: “What do you do for a living?”

P: “I'm unemployed, and you know what? I'm
beginning to think we didn’t win the war.

I'm sorry, but this whole “Be annoyed; buy
American” thing is really silly. First off, if people on
the other side of the planet calls you names, ignore
them. Getting angry over it is a sad argument for
your side. Secondly blaming a race for the comment
of one of its members is pathetic. No American
should take responsibility for all of the inane
statements made by Bush or Reagan.

The whole trade thing is also silly. Before we
condemn theJapanese government for not opening
the markets to our goods, we should first condemn
“American” corporations for not making them here.

Wye Pittsburgh Press ran a matching quiz on the
front page a couple of weeks ago, asking readers
to match different makes of cars with their country
of origin. From a short list of imports and “domestics,”
the only car made here was a Honda.

Face it. Corporate “America”'is just using Japan-
baiting to give it an edge over other foreign

relations, but it is unfair to Asian-
Americans.

Unless America is unable-to support itself, the
question of trade with Japan should fallfar behind
AIDS, health care, unemployment, education,
housing, the infrastructure and a massive rethinking
of America’s drug policy.

If, on the other hand, America can’t support itself,
it’s easy to understand why an outsidermight think
that we are lazy and illiterate. After all, AIDS is
spreading like wildfire, health care is shrinking
from the reach of most Americans and the dream of

owning a house sounds more like ancient mythology 0

every day for a lot of people. We are, in fact, a
democracy; yet we continue to elect candidates
who allow these and other alarming events (loss of
civil rights as a casualty of an inane drug war) to
happen. I can see where an outsider might think
that we are too lazy to be concerned or too illiterate
to be informed. .

Fortunately, this is an election year. The best way
to get people to shut up is to prove them wrong.
Let’s just hope we can.

Some final thoughts on the installation

I wish there was something
that we, as students, could have
done to stop this spending of
$92,000 for the O’Connor
installation. It seems like ever
sinceJ. Dennis O’Connor became
president, the only noteworthy
things he has done was spend
large amounts of money on
Himself? These were labeled
“necessary" both times. How are
alumni expected to donate gladly
for student-tuition funding when
they are asked to help pay for a
ceremony that costs $92,000? I
personally don’t care if it is an
“honorable university tradition”
or if it goes back to medieval
universities, in a time when the

nation is facing an economic crisis,
such spending is unwarranted,
especially with the state cutbacks
on funding for Pitt. When I see
more and more students forced’

Letters

to work while going to school
full time (I am one ofthern), I just
can’t believe what I'm hearing
about this installation. Does J.
Dennis O’Connor know. what
thrifty means?

This installation is clearly not
sitting well with the student
community. J. Dennis O’Connor

is getting off on the wrong foot,
but what I want to know is what
does this mean for our future?
What’s next? When the state
governor criticized this spending,
I would think that would grab
their attention enough for them
to consider putting a stop to such
an expensive ceremony. But no
heed was given to Governor
[Robert] Casey. We’re just going
to go on and spend a‘ wasteful
amount of money to feed a few
hundred semi-important people,
and — oh yeah — We’re thinking
about a tuition increase next year.

Mugged

Woodard,

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports Writer

Pitt travelled to Villanova
looking to secure a potential
NCAA Tournament bid. The only
thing the Panthers secured for
themselves was a night of utter
frustration. -

Villanova hammered the
Panthers, 78-61, in a game that
was truly over at the half. These
two clubs have been going in
opposite directions lately, and
Saturday’s rout at du Pont Pavilion
certainly accented that. The
Panthers fell for the fourth time in
five games, while the Wildcats’
winning streak grew to four
games.

Villanova head coach Rollie
Massimino lauded his club’s
defensive effort.

“I thought this was the fourth
terrific -defensive game we’ve
had,” Massimino said. “Iwas very
impressed with the way Lance
Miller played. He gave himself
up and was there for us
defensively.”

As brilliant as Pitt was in
Tuesday night’s 86-77 upset of
24th-ranked Connecticut, this
performance was as horrific. The
Panthers trailed 44-21 at the half
and watched their deficit grow to
34 points, 72-38, with 8:05
remaining in something that was
supposed to be a contest. The
final eight minutes defined
garbage time.

Pitt could find no answers for
Wildcat seniors Greg Woodard
and Marc Dowdell. Woodard tied
his career-high by scoring 33
points on 10-of-13 shooting from
the floor, including a deadly five
of seven from three-point range.
The 6-foot, 6-inch sharpshooter
also scored 33 against the Panthers
in last season’s 75-72 Wildcat
victory at the Spectrum.

Dowdell hustled all over the
floor, always one step quicker
than Pitt’s big men, Darren
Morningstar and Eric Mobley.
Dowdell finished with 17 points,
seven rebounds and five steals.
Dowdell assisted Miller in keying
‘Nova’s strangling, first-half
defense which stuffed Pitt to the
brutal tune of 10-32 (31.3 percent).
In contrast, the Wildcats blazed
away at a 61-percent clip (14-23)

for the half. Not only did Pitt find
the Cats’ defense perplexing, but
the Panthers could not figure out
the officiating either.

“I thought throughout most of
the game there were eight pretty
pitiful performers out there,”
Evans said, in reference to his
club and the officiating crew of
Larry Lembo, Bob Donato and
Tom Corbin. “How you can have
three fouls in the first half and 20
in the second, playing the same
defense, is beyond me. I would
say that those three guys will
have as much trouble getting into

the NCAAs as we will.”

Woodard and Dowdell
shredded Pitt for 26 of the ‘Cats’
first 33 points, building a 15-
point lead. But the real key in
‘Nova’s decisive first half was the
defense of the versatile junior,
Miller. He completely took Sean
Miller out of the game, throwing
a major wrench into Pitt’s offense,
which never really put together
anything.

“I though Lance was
tremendous,” Massimino said.
“Sean’s a terrific point guard. He’s
involved in everything they do.

He’s really been picking people
apart, and Lance sacrificed his
offensive prowess and played
tremendous defense.”

“He got us totally out of synch.
I think Lance Miller taking Sean
out of the game got us in a bit of
a panicky state,” Evans said.

The ‘Cats led from wire to wire.
Dowdell’s driving layup around
Morningstar put Villanova up 4-0
and prompted Pitt head coach
Paul Evans to summon Mobley
from his bench just two minutes
into the game. Dowdell
immediately schooled Mobley,

driving to the hole for a soft bank
shot and drawing afoul. Dowdell
converted the free throw for a
quick, 7-0, Wildcat lead.

Chris McNeal strung together
two quick baskets to pull Pitt
within 7-4, but things quickly got
out of hand. Mobley drew his
second foul at the 15:15 mark,
only adding to the problems
which Pitt faced in the half. After
Woodard’s pull-up jumper in the
lane gave ‘Nova a 13-6 lead, Jerry
McCullough gave Pitt a rare
highlight with a hanging, double-

Lacrosse lambasts Cardinals in lopsided contest, 23-5

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff‘ Writer

When the game began, they barely had
enough players to field a full team of 10.
Those that were there were scrambling
for their jerseys and equipment. One of
the players remarked that the home team
looked like it was serious about this game.
It should have been a sign, but they did
not heed the warnings. And Wheeling
College paid for its insolence dearly.
The Pitt lacrosse team, playing the role
of the rude host, treated its opposition
worse than the cold, damp weather did,

outhustling, outhitting, outgunning and
generally outplaying Wheeling, en route
to a 23-5 victory Thursday night at Pitt
Stadium.

The game was the first of the season for
Pitt, and the victory places it in the
customary position of first place in the
Allegheny Lacrosse League, a spot it has
occupied for the past two seasons.

Although the final score might indicate
a solid, end—to-end effort, the game did
not start out so.

Pitt came out in the first period, obviously
suffering from “first-game jitters,” throwing
errant passes, forcing bad shots and not

hustling after loose balls.

“This. was our first game after eight
weeks of practice, but we settled down
and things moved along as the game went
on,” Pitt head coach Gary Neft said.

Once the Panthers got rolling, they
exposed Wheeling for the pathetic
opponent it really was. Pitt’s passing
became sharper, the players began to
hustle and their shots began to hit the back
of the net.

An invitation in the form of a Wheeling
penalty was sent graciously to Pitt, and it
cashed it in. Midfielder Lee Stember, last
season’s leading scorer with 44 goals and

10 assists, added to his career-point total
by feeding attackman Ed Croot in front of
the net for the Panthers’ first goal of the
game. The Panthers added goals by Craig
Leslie and Chad Lehman to take a 5-0 lead

- into the second period. They added seven

more goals to take a 10-0 lead into the half.

Scoring in the second period for Pitt
were Brenden Leezer, Daryl] Schmitt, Josh
Gochnauer, Pete'Guevara (twice), Croot
and Steve Grass.

On the defensive end, Pitt was able to
keep Wheeling’s attackmen clear from the
goal, consistently breaking up any scoring

Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers roller-
coaster regular season finally
came to a close Saturday with a
finish to rival any one of the rides
at Kennywood.

After falling behind by as many
as 17 points early in the first half
to the Georgetown Hoyas, Pitt
went on a 51-8 spree over a 12-
minute span before halftime to
take control of the game, going
on to win, 70-67.

Erin Maloy led the Lady
Panthers in scoring, chalking up
21 for the game. She broke out of
a recent shooting slump, sinking
six out of eight from three-point
range and three out of four from
the free—throw line.

“Erin shot the ball real well
today,” Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “She got it where she could
just catch it, square up and shoot
it. She shot ‘less than she does
sometimes, but she made more
of them. Instead of taking 15
shots and having half of them
being bad shots, she took eight
and they were all the kind of
shots that you want."

The game started out looking
like another ugly loss for Pitt. 'l'he
Hoyas burst out to a 22-5
advantage. The only offense the

Lady Panthers could muster was
a Jill McElhinny driving layup
two minutes into the game and a
Maloy trey one minute later.
After Georgetown’s Nadira
Ricks gave her team a 17-point
lead, Mcljlhinny canned two free
throws to make it 22-7 with 10:31
to play in the half. I-Ier charity
tosses were the beginning of the
run that put Pitt in front for good.
Forward Jonna Huemrich
played a key role in the Lady
Panthers’ run, scoring all 10 of
her first-half points during that
stretch. She ﬁnished with 14 points
and nine rebounds. But she was
limited in her offensive role,

playing almost eight minutes of’

the second half with four fouls.
Pitt’s surge to the front was closed
out by Carol Morton's steal and
layup with 41 seconds left.

“We just came out like we were
in a coma,” Bruce said. “They
play real aggressive basketball,
and we started out cold. There
was really two halves to the first
half. in the first part, we were
awful on both ends of the court.
However we started to wake up
and play good defense. When
we did that, we limited them to
one shot on offense, and we
started making our lshotsl.”

A switch in the type ofdefense
also played a role in the Lady

Panthers’ come back. Instead of
playing their normal, rnan-to-man
attack, the Lady Panthers dropped
back into a zone attack.

“We tried to stay with our man,
but it just wasn’t working,” Bruce
said.

“Then we tried a three-quarter-
court press to try and shake things,
up and that wasn’t successful,
either. Our zone has been kind of
weak, but we used it anyway and
it ended up being very effective.”

The different look worked in
stopping the Hoyas’ powerful
offensive weapons.

Kris Whitfill, who lit the Lady
Panthers up for over 30 points
last season, was held to just six in
the first half, 18 for the game.
Center Karen Sheehan scored
only two, and guard Ricks netted
six ,

“I thought we did a nice job of
keeping them off the boards and
limiting their shooting,” Bruce
said. V

Pitt extended its lead to nine
points early in the second half
before Georgetown began to
come back.

The Hoyas sliced the margin
down to one point, 41-40, with
just over 15:30 showing on the
game clock.

Maloy answered with a huge

Bulls burn Blazers
in overtime, 10-9

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staﬂ“ Writer

There’s no place like home.

That’s what the Bulls were
saying Saturday night after
forward Tim Hormes clicked his
heels and squeaked the game-
winner by Blazers goalie Bruce
Donaldson at the 3:10 mark of
overtime. A

That goal sent the team spilling
onto the turf, as it had just won
the championship and propelled
Pittsburgh to a 10-9 win against
Boston in front of almost 9,000
adulate, screaming fans at the
Civic Arena.

“I just happened to see an
opening, and it went in,” Hormes
said about his goal.

For the Bulls (2-4), the winwas
their first against a divisional
opponent and the second at home
this season. The team has yet to
win on the road and has been all
but eliminated from playoff
contention. The Bulls presently
occupy the cellar of the National
Division. The loss drops the
‘Blazers’ record to 3-3 and keeps
them in second place.

“The fans here have been
unbelievable. Nine thousand fans
came out to see a 1-4 team. We
owed them this one,” Bulls head
coach Dennis Wey said.

. At first it appeared that the
Bulls were going to run awa
with the game. -

The way I see it, the
Pittsburgh Penguins are a
bunch of quitters. Their effort
this season leaves much to be
desired, after a 1990—’91 season
that saw them win the Stanley
Cup. Their pathetic play since
the first of the year has rivaled
the play of Quebec and San
Jose.

Not everyone is to blame,
though. First, Rick Tocchet,
Kjell Samuelsson,JeffChychrun
and Ken Wregget are not to be
blamed. If you remember
correctly, the Penguins were
playing poor hockey even
while Mark Recchi and Paul
Coffey were still here. They
were 2-6-2 in the 10 games
leading up to the big trade.
These four players can’t be
expected to make up for the
awful play of their teammates,
and they certainly should not
be used as the scapegoats.

Players like Larry Murphy
and Joe Mullen deserve no
blame. Murphy has been the
Penguins’ best and by far most
consistent player this year. His
play was better than Coffey’s
while Coffey was here, and
Murphy is currently among the
top 10 in both plus/minus and
scoring for defensemen.

goals to take a 3-1 lead into the
second period.

The Bulls “secure” lead was
turned to mud, as the Blazers
ripped off ﬁve unanswered goals
to silence the home crowd and
take their first lead of the game,
7—6.Exit Bilger; enter back-up
goalie Bob Heyes.

“A goalie change shakes up the
defense,” Wey said. “I pulled
Kevin to get a lift from the team.
He had a great first half.”

Wey’s move did just what he
set out to accomplish, and the
Bulls rallied to tie the game at
seven on Hormes’ first goal of the
evening. The Bulls then took the
lead just 30 seconds later on a
goal by Greg Manley.

No lead is too safe, however,
andonce again Boston came back
with a goal late in the period to
knot the game, 8-8.

The Bulls did not make things
easy for themselves in the fourth,
taking penalties that left them
shorthanded for a good part of
the time. 

With forward Randy Ernst off
for holding at the 7:15 mark,
again the Bulls found themselves
down a man at a crucial point in
the game.

the day Coffey and Recchi were
traded, instead of trying to give
support to his new teammates.
The Pens must be seriously
wondering why they resigned
Ron Francis. I know they canft
be blamed for signing him,
considering his play in the
playoffs, But for a two—way
center, both his offense and
defense are well below
standard. When Lemieux is out

There are a few solutions I
feel the Penguins can make to
try to right themselves. First,
they need a player to step
forward as the leader, like
Stevens did in the playoffs. Next,
if I were Craig Patrick, I'd
consider another major trade
— involving Francis or even
Barrasso. They could get an

Mullen deserves no blame.
He went through a goal-scoring
drought earlier this year, but at
least he has recovered— unlike
others on the team. He has
been the Pens’ best, if not only,
offensive weapon as of late. He
has also kept his mind on
playing a good defensive game,
something other forwards on
this team don’t do.

The people who deserve
blame forthe Pens’ current play
are Tom Barrasso, Kevin
Stevens, Ron’ Francis and even
Mario Lemieux. Barrasso’s play
as of late has been atrocious.
He has given up more bad goals
in the past few weeks then
goalies like Patrick Roy give up
in a year.

Kevin Stevens has not been
the same player he was in the
first halfof the season. His goal
production has dropped as of
late, though the referees hurt
him here. (He has taken
countless stuﬁid penalties,
which leave his team
shorthanded.) Stevens also is
not the leader he was in the
playoffs. He blasted Craig Patrick

Sports Editor

One could say that Pitt's 78-61
loss to Villanova was a blowout,
pure and simple. Ilowever three
things stick out as key factors in
the Panthers’ demise.

The first and perhaps most
telling item from Saturday night’s
game at du Pont Pavilion was the
inefficiency of the Pitt offense,
which put together back—to—back
baskets only four times during
the entire game.

Much of this was due to
Villanova’s Lance Miller, who
relentlessly hounded Pitt point
guard Sean Miller throughout the
game.

“Sean is the heart and soul Of
that team,” Lance Miller said. “We
just tried to take him out of the
Offense."

At6-feet, 6-inches, Lance Miller
has a distinct advantage over the
Panthers’ lead guard. Yet in the
first Pitt-’I\'ova contest this year,
Pitt negated this with a balanced
inside game, which included a
career performance from Iiric
Mobley.

Saturday night's game was a
whole different story. Clhris
McNeaI was the only Panther
frontliner to reach double figures;

he had 19 points.

The rest of the forwards and
centers (eight in number)
accumulated 1‘) points and I7
rebounds on the night.

“The inside men really stepped
up and stole some passes and
denied the ball,” said ‘Nova guard
Greg Woodard. “That disrupted
their offense.”

All told, the Wildcats were
credited with 14 steals. Senior
forward Marc Dowdell had five,
which is a third of his total steals
on the season. Villanova
constantly harassed both the
passer and the receiver, usually
with good results.

“I was very impressed with the
way Lance lMiIIerl really gave
himself up,” Wildcat head coach
Rollie Massimino said. “He did a
terrific job defensively on Sean,
and Sean has just been picking
people apart.”

Offensively, the game was very
frustrating for Sean Miller, The
senior had more turnovers (six)
than assists (five), a rare
occurrence for him. He also
committed all four of his fouls in
the second half, often in obvious
frustration.

After driving into the lane and
being fouled by ‘Nova’s Calvin

clutch bucket to cut the margin to
ﬁve. Then Woodard and Dowdell
grabbed this game by the throat.

Woodard glided inside for an
easy layup. Then Dowdell drove
through the lane for a soft jump
hook over Mobley to boost the
lead to nine. Gandhi Jordan
converted a nice, three-on-two
break with a pretty dish by Miller
to bring Pitt within 17-12. Then
came the turning point that would
ignite a 27-7 Villanova run.

Woodard drilled a three-pointer
from the top of the key while
being knocked to the floor by
Morningstar. He hit the free throw
for a four-point play, and the
‘Cats, up 21-12, never looked
back. Dowdell dropped in a pretty
backdoor feed from Miller, then
converted a driving, fast-break
layup for a 25-14 lead. This forced
Evans to call time out in an effort

to control the damage.

However Woodard connected
on two consecutive treys from
the left wing to push the lead to
31-16 at the seven-minute mark.
The ‘Cats continued to light it up,
with Woodard’s driving layup
resulting in a three-point play
and ‘Nova’s largest first-halflead,
44-19.

Jermaine Morgan hit the first
basket of the second half to cut
‘Nova’s lead to 44-23, but Pitt
never made a run. The ‘Cats led
50-25 with 17:05 remaining when
Woodard exploded again. He
scored ‘Nova’s next 10 points on
two treys and two drives to the
hole. The second of the three-
point bombs made it 60-31. Miller
flashed in for another easy layup
to double the score, 62-31, at the
13:10 mark.

Pitt’s record fell to 16-13, 8-8 in
Big East play. The Panthers will

face Boston College Tuesday
night at Fitzgerald Field House.
This is a must-win for the Panthers
in terms of an NCAA bid. Pitt will
travel to the Capital Centre to
visit the red-hot Georgetown
Hoyas in their regular-season
finale on Saturday.

Villanova is 12-13 (9-7 in Big
east play). With victories in their
final two games, the ‘Cats may
have a slim chance at a berth in
the big dance.The ‘Cats realize
their backs are to the wall.

“The NCAAs are in the back of
our mind. It’s our goal,” Woodard
said. “Two wins, and I think we’ll
make it. Our team is really
responding to a gut check.”

But Massimino said he has his
doubts. “We went on a six—game
quest, so to speak, and we’ve got
four of them so far, “he said. “But
that’s not gonna be enough, and
we know that."

threats-when they did not mess
things up for themselves.

When Wheeling did get a shot
at the Panthers’ net, goaltender
Scott Knowles was there, stopping
the two first-half shots.

The Panthers did‘ not let up
during the third period. They
took a 12-0 lead on goals by
Leslie and Stember before
surrendering one to Wheeling,
on the the power play, that eluded
the reach of back—up goalie Mike

and Stember to hold a clearly
insurmountable 16-4 lead at the

end of three.

One would expect Pitt to ease
up a little on the offensive end,
but that was not the case, as they
continued to dominate offensively
and defensively, pouring in
another seven goals. The final,
No. 23, came with only 22 seconds
left on the clock.

Panther scorers in the fourth
were Gochnauer, Brian Barrett
(twice), Leslie, Kounas, Brian
McGann and Guevara.
Goaltender Shiner finished the
game saving 10 of Whee1ing’s 15
second-half shots.

“I’m real pleased with the way
the younger guys came out and
played,” Neft said. 9

“We have incredible depth, and
we will come together as a team.”

The high scorer for the Panthers

was Stember, who finished the
game with two goals and ﬁve
assists.

Multiple-goal scorers for Pitt
include Croot (four goals, one
assist), Gochnauer (two goals,
four assists), Ieslie and Kounas
(two goals, one assist), Pete
Guevara (three goals) and Brian
Barrett (two goals).

Pitt’s next game is Tuesday
night, 7 p.m., at Pitt Stadium
against another Allegheny
Lacrosse League opponent, the
Rockets from Slippery Rock
University.

“Slippery Rock is a better team,”
NCf[ Said;

“T heyalways play us tough.”

Admission to the game is free,
and there are sure to be plenty of
good seats available.

three the next trip down for the
Lady Panthers, putting them back
in front by four. /

The closest Georgetown could
get the rest of the way was two
points, and each time Pitt
answered with a bucket to quell
any outbreak of Hoya Paranoia.

Jill Colabrese iced the contest
for the Lady Panthers when she
hit on one of two tries from the
foul line, putting Pitt ahead 68-
62. I-Iuemrich and Maloy each
added a free throw, providing for
the final 70-67 margin.

According to Bruce, the entire
team does not have to score for
the outcome to be positive.

“This was probably one of our
best team efforts of the year,”
Bruce said.

“We had players in there who
don’t score much, but their
contributions are key for us to be
successful. Lisa Fessler did not

offensive-defensive in return to
take the place of Coffey. It’s
obvious this lineup, like the lineup
with Coffey and Recchi, is not
going to make it to the playoffs,
let alone win the Stanley Cup.
And the bottom line is if the Pens
keep playing this way, the
Islanders or Flyers deserve to be
in the playoffs over the Pens. At
least the Islanders and Flyers are
playing with a purpose.

Tournament March 6-9.

Keys
Continued from page 12
Byrd, he rushed over to referee
Bob Donato and said, “Good

call. Good call.”

The second factor was
perimeter shooting. Villanova
had it, and Pitt did not.
Woodard’s 33-point
performance included five
three-pointers.

The Panthers were
punchless from outside,
however, and that made it

« easier for ‘Nova to sag on the

interior players.

Of the 10 field goals that
Pitt made in the first half, none
came from outside the paint
area. The Panthers made four
perimeter jumpers all night,
while Woodard was the chief
Wildcat culprit.

‘‘I really felt into it tonight,”
Woodard said. “We wanted to
attack the defense, and I like
to shoot when I’m open."

Villanova executed nearly
ﬂawless screens in freeing the
6-6 senior for jump shots. Once
known as streaky, Woodard
was consistently poised and
in control on offense, as was
the whole team.

The perimeter strength of
Woodard opened up the lane
for the driving Wildcat
forwards.

Although the 6-9 Dowdell
was at times dwarfed by Pitt’s
big men, he could drive around
them and was fouled often on

the way to the'basket. The

perimeter showing led to a-

seemingly endless parade to
the foul line, where ‘Nova is
one of the best teams in the
nation. Saturday, the ‘Cats
converted 29 of 34 from the
charity stripe.

Contributing to those
numbers were the officials,
who were the third key factor
in the game.

The inexplicable lack of
consistency displayed by Larry
Lembo, Donato and Tom
Corbin led to the horrible flow
of the game. Although the final
stat sheet shows that the
number of personal fouls was
relatively equal (Pitt had 25 to
‘Nova’s 23), they did not come
that way.

The main problem for the"
Panthers seemed to be in the
first half, when they tried to
get the ball into the post. The
officials did not distinguish
between a reach-in foul and a
steal, and time and again the
Wildcats foiled the passing
attempts of the Panthers. Evans
described the interior play as
“muggings.”

The first-half play-by-play
for Pitt reads like a long stretch
of fouls periodically
interrupted by a made field
goal or free throw. The
opposite was true of the second
half, when Villanova amassed
17 of its 23 fouls.
