  Allocations

Dispenses

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

More than $210,000 has been
allocated to 37 student organiza-
tions for the 1971-72 fiscal year.
The funds were recommended
by the Allocations Committee
and approved by the Social Com-
mission from total budget re-
quests of more than $400,000.
Several budgets are pending.

The ‘ largest budgets approved
were the Social and Programs
Commissions’. The Social Com-
mission was granted $75,196 for
concerts, dances, and other en-
tertainment. The Programs Com-
mission received $24,925 for a
speakers and /programs series".

However, both budgets include
funds for joint programs with
other campus groups. According
to William Lenaghan, Assistant
Director of Student Activities,
the Allocations Committee~want-
ed to avoid funding separate
groups for identical programs.
Therefore the Social Commis-
sion was allocated $3500 to co-
sponsor dances with the Com-

muter Association, Men's Dor-

mitory Council, and Women‘s
Housing Board. The Programs
Commission was given $3000 to
bring in speakers in conjunction
with Environmental Action and
Women’s Housing Board.

The Owl, Pitt‘s yearbook, was
allocated the third largest bud-
get, receiving $21,151 for its cur-
rent fiscal year and an addition-
al $4,964 for a deficit. The Pitt
News had the next highest bud-
get, $17,925.

Student organizations are fund-
ed from the student activities
fee which has brought in $190,-
000 annually at a cost of $8 per
student. Because of the large
amount of requests this year,
however, the Allocations Com-
mittee suggested the fee be
raised to $12. After approval by
the Social
commendation by Bernard Ko-
bosky, Vice Chancellor for Pub-
lic‘ Affairs, the Board of Trustees
recently approved the bike
which will bring in additional
revenue of $60-75,000.

Three new policies designed to
prevent the misuse of student
funds have also been enacted.
They are:

1) All monies from past bud-
gets remaining in student organ-
ization accounts as of July 1.
1971 will be recalled; I

2) Organizations will be re-
quired to keep up-to-date books
that will be audited two or
three times a year by the Allo-
cations Committee. Money the
Committee feels is being mis-
used will be recalled;

3) Organizations planning any
substantial changes in anticipat-
ed expenses or income must
gain Committee approval.

The University has decided to
scrap its Forbes area develop-
ment plans in favor of a scheme
to be devised by representatives
of Pitt, the Oakland community.
the City, and the ‘State.

Vice Chancellor of Finance
Edison Montgomery, who reveal-
ed the University’s decision at
a joint University/ city/ community
last night, also announced that
the University would “. . . . sus-
pend immediately and indefin-
itely all future property acquisi-
tions 1 . . in the Forbes Field
area, with the exception of the
Civic Center Motel.”

The Forbes area development
program included construction
in four phases of a Law School,
building complex for the School
of Education and various depart-
ments of the Social Sciences.
parking space, and a cultural
center. '

; The new. cooperative effort,
said Montgomery, must yield
as much square footage for Uni-
versity use as was provided in
the original plans for the Forbes
area development.

He also said that “In the joint
planning effort, provision will be
made for the development of
new commercial space and ‘peo-
ple-oriented’ space . . .”, two
facets of a community plan pre-
sented earlier as «an alternative
to the original scheme but re-
jected by the University.

Though Pitt's financial re-
sources will be usedonly for
those‘ parts of the development
related to academic needs, Mont-
gomery did not rule out the pos-
sible use of Pttt‘s endowment
fund for investment purposes

. plans, , Montgomery

to finance or purchase those

non-acade nic projects.

In announcing the University‘s
said that
Forbes Field would be razed
immediately, despite hopes for
its rehabilitation by some Oak-
land residents. He cited the  —. .
hazard presented by Forbes Field
and the extreme costliness and
difficulty in securing the struc-
ture . .  as reasons for the de-
molition.

“There appear to be no real
prospects for its redevelopment,
and the cost of converting it for
any use would be far greater
than the cost of new facilities,”
he said. He estimated the cost
to the University of securing
the ball park at $2000 per week.

Delayed By Objections
Implementation of the Uni-

‘versity‘s original plan. schedul-

ed for last spring, had been de-
layed in order that Oakland re-
sidents, the city. and more re-
cently. the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania could voice objec-
tions to the plan.

Oakland residents became

alarmed when the General State’

Authority (GSA) began pur-
chasing for the University‘s ex-
pansion plans homes and com-
mercial establishments in the
block bounded by Forbes Ave..
South Bouquet St., Sennott St..
and Oakland Ave.

Represented primarily by a
group known as Peoples Oak-
land, they claimed that the Uni-
versity’s development would
create traffic chaos, alter the
life styles of certain neighbor-
hoods, and facilitate further Uni-
versity expansion into, South Oak-
land. They maintained that

Pitt had ample space within its

present boundaries to expand.
Speaking for the City of Pitts-
burgh. Director of City Planning
Robert Paternoster said that if
the University did transcend its
current boundaries, the City
. offer
some means of relief for the
burden . .
City's tax base.

And last week. Governor Mil-

ton Shapp asked the University
to delay construction until it

‘could effect a plan that would,

involve community input.

“These developments,”
Montgomery, “have caused the
University to reevaluate its own
position in these negotiations . .”

“A Start”

The University finalized -its
revised position at a meeting
yesterday afternoon with City
and community representatives.
Peoples Oakland member Mike
Adams, who was present at the
afternoon session, said of the
new planning procedure: "We
think it‘s a start.”

Joint planning efforts will be
coordinated by Charles Blum,
Deputy Executive Director of the
GSA. They 'will began when

community groups decide who ‘L

is to represent them.

Montgomery was not certain
how long Pitt‘s expansion would

be postponed while the joint
planning continues. “If ‘every-
thing clicks properly," he said,

"the delay could be as short as
one year.

  Women’s Studies Approved

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Considered to be a vanguard
in the movement by many fem-
inists. the University was quick
to give academic attention to
women's liberation. It responded
to requests by women faculty
and students by offering several
courses in women‘s studies dur-
ing the last two years on such
subjects as the role of women
in society and literature. Two
courses are to be offered again
this fall.

Now the University has taken
the first step in establishing a
formal program in women's stu-
dies. On July 1 the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council
(FASC) approved by a minimal
quorum vote of 5-3 a proposal
that would establish a limited.
interdisciplinary program to be
operative September, 1972.

The proposal was submitted
by a task force of the Advisory
Committee on Women's Oppor-
tunities (ACWO) and endorsed
by the College of Arts and Sci-
ence Council. Proposal advo-
cates present at the FASC meet-
ing were Marcia Landy, Eng-
lish professor and principal au-

thor of the proposal, and Jerome
Schneewind. Dean. College of
Arts and Sciences.

The ACWO is an advisory

group appointed in the spring of
1970 by the Chancellor to help
study the problems and oppor-
tunities for
versity.

line. -

The proposal calls for the hir-
ing of a core faculty of no less
than five feminists and the addi-
tional hiring of faculty from
other departments within the
University on a part-time basis.

Because women’s studies is a

new field, the program will be -

divided between research of
problems and issues as well as
teaching. According to the writ-
ten proposal, faculty and stu-
dents will be encouraged to ex-
amine such topics as family sex
roles, child care programs, and
the degree to which courses are
oriented toward “male perform-
ance, male dominance, and to-
ward the perpetuation -of male
hegemony.”

The July 8 issue of University
Times, reported the motion made
by Dr. Burkhart Holzner. chair-
man of the sociology depart-
ment, was passed only after
much questioning of the struc-
tural, budgetary. curricular, and
ideological aspects of the pro-
gram.

One man was reported by the
Times as declaring. “The Uni-
/ersity cannot afford to estab-
ish a center for every problem
which comes up.“

Holzner said, however. “This
should be a weighty and presti-
gious program that would influ-
ence other parts of the Univer-
sity . The establishment of

such a program would give much
needed visibility

Summer Employment:

by RON. LOZOWSKI

For many Pitt students, sum-
mer is a season for lolling in the
sun. or even attending classes.
but a few are hard at work, quite

, often at tasks a bit out of the or-

dinary.

A notable example is junior
Mike O‘Loughlin. a racqueteer of
sorts. Mike,_ however, poses no
threat to the likes of Al Capone;

. the only racquet he‘s involved
with is used to knock a fuzzy ball
over a net.

He further remarked that “you

range from little old ladies in

one grows older. citing as an ex-

an 87 year—old ace to defeat a
pair of men in their forties. “This
guy is always out there on the
courts." noted Mike, adding that
this simply proves that tennis is
for everyone. regardless of age.

While O'Loughlin is offering
tennis lessons, Alan Tolchinsky is
busily helping prepare lessons of
a different sort. Alan‘s title he
said. “sounds impressive. all
right: ‘audio duplicator and editor’

lamented Alan.

“It‘s kind of . . well . . different.“
he conceded.

Alan, who will enter dental
school this fall, has not yet un-
dertaken his true task, which will
include checking for possible er-
rors on educational tapes record-
ed by Carnegie-Mellon University

will be to record the signal tone

i'Mattress’ Moves

From Bed to Worse

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

When Once Upon A Mattress
opened on Broadway. the over-
all response was four stars for
Carol Burnett and a minus—0ne
for the show. The reason for this
descrepancy is that the show is
about as thin as Melba Toast. In
the Odd Chair Playhouses pro-
duction. it is thinner than a wa-
fer. A

Once Upon a Mattress is bas-
ed on the fairy tale The Princess
and the Pea. It describes the
trials and tribulations of "the
prince" who cannot marry until
thedemands of his over protec-
tive queen mother, who devises
hideous ordeals to determine the
“perfect princess" for her son
to marry, are met. Then on the
other hand. there are the prob-
lems of the princess who finally

rates the prince by not falling‘

asleep on 20 mattresses under
which a pea is placed. The story
revolves around this pea . . . and
the story itself is about that size.

What could make the show
worth the-money is elaborate
scenery, a strong chorus, high-
stepping choreography. elaborate
costumes, plus the voices for the

‘music and acting to match.

Unfortunately, with the excep-
tion of Lenora Nemitz (Princess).
Jim Horne (King Sextimus the
Silent) and Paul Greeno (Prince
Dauntless). there is very little
to talk about. Other than Ron-
ald Sopyla (Wizard), Barney Mc-
Kenna (Jester) and David Tomp-
kins (Prince Harry), who serve
in fine support, most of the re-

_ mainder of the cast might well

have been forgotten. -

M

The problem is that with the
exception of Miss Nemitz. no
one can really carry off the
music. and with the exception of
both she and Jim Home. the
acting is little better than ama-
teur.

Only two musical numbers
show everybody working togeth-
er at their best. The first in-
stance is in “Minstrel, Jester
and I" and the other is during
“Song of Love" which ends the
first act. The remainder of the
numbers were for the most part.
awkwardly staged with very lit-
tle togetherness.

The show is directed by Tom
Thomas. Thomas is as inconsis-
tent in the area of musical com-
edy as any director I‘ve seen. I
understand he‘s excellent with
drama and comedy. For the
opening production of the season
Celebration his direction was_of
note; in past productions at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse his efforts
varied. With this one they are
of little reward. He has little to
work with, and from the way
opening night looked. he had
little time to put things togeth-
er. Perhaps the biggest disad-
vantage was ever choosing the
show at all.

Once Upon A Mattress will
continue at the Odd Chair Play-
house until Aug. 1. It will be
followed by the comedy The
Women playing from August 4-
15. The season will end with the
prize-winning musical comedy
Cabaret opening August 18.

'Amlcrsmi Tapes’ Tops

“Blacktop” Highway Robbery

by STEVE ZYCH

"You're nothing but a cou-
ple of small town-shithead-
speed freaks" bellows veter-
an actor Warren Oates at
non—actors James Taylor and
Dennis Wilson. he of the
Beachboys. This is probably
the most poignant line (and
probably the longest) in the
pointless. boring and over-
rated rated (Esquire called it “the

film of the year") racing
film Two Lane Blacktop
currently featured at the
Shadyside Theater.

 

The film has far less dia-

logue than an Italian west- '
ern. which isn‘t saying
much. but then again nei-

ther does this film. The plot

(I‘m being very kind) cen-
ters ‘ around a meaningless
race to Washington, D.C.
between Warren Oates‘ G.
T.O. and the dynamic doll-
arhungry duo of James Tay-
lor and Dennis Wilson in
their 454 1955 Chevy. The
prize consists of some pink
slips, their cars, and Laurie
Bird. a girl who is‘ hitching
with Taylor and Wilson. who
are. known in the film as
“the driver“ and “the me-

chanic." How clever.

Dialogue. depth. character de-
velopment, perceptivity. acting~
all that comprises a fine film-

is lacking. with one notable ex-
ception. The photography is lush.

Dialogue between rockers Tay-
lor and Wilson (who were added
to the film on the advice of a
major Madison Ave. P.T. film’s
market research computer data)
is reduced to grunts and mono-
syllable groans about cars by
sceneartist Rudolph Wurlitzer,
whose shadow of a script (again
I’m stretching definitions for the
sake of kindness) is silly and
trite at best. '

Acting is restricted to Warren
Oates (The Wild Bunch, In the
Heat of the Night)who. compar-
ed to nameless nonentities like
“the driver" and "the mechan-
ic“ is a polished Shakespearean
thespian. Small wonder Time
thought “Oates is one of the best
actors around.“

The plot is nonexistent
except for the unending and
sickening series of raucous-
ly routine races over back-
woods roads from Texas to
Tennessee. Even these se-
quences are wasted —~ any
Wide World of Sports Spe-
cial has far better staged se-
quences.

‘Forbes Field

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Forbes Field is an overrun,

r underprotected, vandalized

A-shell of a baseball park that

 

 

will soon play host to a dif-
ferent and more final kind of

‘ ball—the wrecker’s ball.

The University announced
last night that the contract
for the demolition of the old
park, delayed since March,

a will be sighed today.

Since that first broken engage-
ment with the grim reaper, the

  

 

MONTGOMERY
Announces move

-old ball park had withstood the

heat of five months of commun-
ity/University/city talks. and. re-
cently. one actual fire. Destruc-
tion of the House of Thrills,
which seemed imminent several
times. had been repeatedly de-

layed due to community or city T
A objections to the

Universitys
Forbes area development plans.

In a dramatic statement be-
fore community and city rep-
resentatives last night, Vice
Chancellor of Finance ‘ Edison
Montgomery said "that Pitt will
scrap those plans‘ and begin
anew, this time in co-operation
with the community, the city,
and the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania.

Ambitious Expansion

The University long projected
the razing of Forbes as the ini-
tial step in its Forbes area de-
velopment program, and ambi-
tious expansion plan that en-
visioned construction of several
building complexes, parking
space. and a cultural center.

Also planned were the so-
called Hillside Dorms. a struc-
ture to be erected on the hill-
side near Allequippa St. that
was to accomodate 1200 stu-
dents.

Forbes Phase I, seen as the
first of four construction phases
of the Forbes area development,
included plans for a School
of Law and a building complex
for the School of Education and
various Social Science depart-
ments, plus underground park-
ing. The General State Author-
ity (GSA), which purchased
Forbes Field from Pitt for $3
million, would have financed all
construction.

The GSA found that it requir-
ed the block bounded by Forbes
Ave.. South Bouquet St.. Sen-
nott St.. and.Oakland Ave. to
build atop and to run power
lines "beneath. /-

When it began to buy com-
mercial establishments and re-
sidences in the block. however.
angered residents and a suspi-
cious city had some questions.

The city invited some com-
munity groups, including Mo-
del Cities, the Allequippa-Ava-
lon-Brackenridge Block Club,
the Chamber of Commerce, the
South Oakland Citizens Coun-
cil, and Peoples Oakland, to
discuss with the University Pitt’s
expansion plans.

Peoples Oakland

In the months that followed.
the burden of representing the

community fell upon Peoples
Oakland. a scrappy band of Oak-
land residents, a few profession-
als. and some students.

Hampered somewhat by its
smallness. the group.was also
plagued by a shortage of cash
and charges that it never truly
represented the Oakland com-
munity.

Financial woes were eased
somewhat when Walt Boykowicz,
a teacher of architectural design
at Carnegie-Mellon University
and a member of Peoples Oak-
land, was placed on the payroll
of the City Planning Depart-
ment. The city and the Univer-
sity pay Boykowicz’ salary.

Group members seem resign-s

ed to the persistent charges of
misrepresentation. "Of. course
there are mixed feelings in the
community.“ said Kim Fellner.
a Peoples Oakland member. She
added that group members
“have made real attempts to in-
form“ Oakland residents of all
events.

Good Fences, Good Neighbors

Despite its lack of resources
and late entry into the fray.
Peoples Oakland was able to
persuade the University to radi-
cally change its plans for the
Hillside Dorms. Those plans
are now being. redrawn by the
University with community ad-
vice.

Until yesterday, the Univer-
sity balked at changing its For-
bes area design to meet Peoples
Oakland objections.

Peoples Oakland argued that
the University plans. if com-
pleted. would impair traffic in
Oakland. depersonalize the life
styles and environment of the
neighborhood. and smooth the
way for construction of Forbes
Phases II-IV in the manner al-
ready blueprinted by the Uni-
versity -—~ that is. without com-
munity input.

Peoples Oakland architects
litichard Brittain. Troy West.
and Boykowicz devised their

own plan for the rehabilitation
of Forbes Field. calling for
clas.<.;room space. a farmers
market. and open areas for use
by the University and the com-
munity. ~

“The House of Thri||s”—-ForbesFie|d——cis it is today.

“We tried to deal with the
problems of interface,” explain-
ed Boykowicz. Interface allows
mutual and affable use of facili-
ties, a concept based on the
belief that good fences indeed
make good neighbors.

Following a detailed study by
its own architects. the University
rejected the plan, claiming that
it would be more expensive to
rehabilitate Forbes than it
would be to tear it down and
build the community's plans
from scratch. *

 

FELLNER
Moneuvering game.

Before last nights announce-
ment. Peoples Oakland members
were not convinced of the good-
ness of their neighbors inten-
tions or the value of five months

of tripartite negotiations..

“The meetings,” said Boy-
kowicz, “have essentially been
a forum, a place to air ideas.”
He claimed that “there has not
yet been a cooperative design.”

“We are sort of advisorswho
need not constrain the adminis-
tration.“ he said.

Fellner. a graduate student in
communications at Pitt. concur-
red.

"Their (the tripartite meet-
ingst importance is more related
to the fact _that communication
has taken place. rather than
what has resulted.“

described the
meetings as "power-parrying."
a show of "who can outman—
euver whom when.‘

much a victim as manipulator
of changing circumstances.

Around a decade ago, when
University visionaries first de-
veloped the idea of a Master
Plan for Pitt’s expansion, it did
not seem particularly pressing
for them to consult the com-
munity they were planning to
displace. Progress was progress,
and no one imagined an irate
community would brace itself
against Forbes’ ivy-covered walls
and battle Progress’ bulldozers
with sticks and stones.

"It was easier." speculated
Boykowicz. "to conceive of an
urban renewal scheme that

wiped out an entire area that. to
a dispassionate eye. seemed un-
fit to live in."

When Pete Flaherty blew into
office. the political winds bear-
ing the city shifted with him.
“We must place a moratorium
on the growth and expansion
of tax exempt institutions." said

the maverick Democratic May--

01'.

 

PATERNOSTER
“A new atmosphere . . .”

“The Commission will consid-
er no further applications for

University expansion until there‘

is sufficient community input to
the planning process,” said John
Bitzer, chairman of the City
Planning Commission.

And there was the University.
a tax \exempt. expansion-bound
institution that had cultivated
no community suggestions for
its expansion scheme.

Well. even if the University's
plan flew in the face of the new
Mayor's new directives‘. it was
still a sophisticated. well-form-

ulated plan. unrivalled by any-
thing the community could mus-
ter on such short notice. It was
hardly possible for a coopera-
tive plan to be hammered out
when there existed a design rea-
dy to be implemented.

“A Community There”

Understandably. the
sity clung tenaciously to its
much-maligned plan. Its dele-
gates repeatedly pointed out the
time and money that were spent
on the plan. the time and mon-

Univer-

ﬁg-,ey all the delays have cost. and
2 the time and money it would
1 take’ to junk the plan in favor

pf a cooperative effort. .

“ Yet, for all its alleged in-
transigence, the University was
patient, if "uneasy, and open to
suggestion.

Robert Paternoster. Director
of the City Planning Depart-
ment and chairman of the tri-
partite meetings. said the Uni-
versity "could have easily torn
it (Forbes) down in March.“

"They‘ve been rather fair. I
think. in waiting." he said.

Early in the talks. Montgom-
ery said that the Phase I pro-
posal was non-negotiable un-
less an acceptable alternative
and one with financial backing
could be found. The non-nego-
liable proposal was negotiated
for five months and finally drop-
ped in favor of an uncertain fu-
ture. '

Director of the Physical Plant
Division Hunt Martin, who with
Montgomery represented the Uni-
versity at most of the meetings,
said the University was able to
talk rationally with community
representatives because there
is now “a community there for
us to respond to."

 

 

MARTIN
New Rules

"There has been a change in
the nature ofvthe representation
of the community." he said.

‘‘It‘s now representing itself ra-

ther than being represented by
government agents."

As one would expect on an
issue that cuts so close to the
cores of many. the discussions
had their irrational moments.
Martin said he could distinguish
two segments of community re-
presentation—a "radical element
that makes noise. applauds. and
cheers.“ and “another element.
a profound. intelligent. logical
group of people".

At a tripartite session July
16, roughly 100 residents swell-
ed the Peoples Oakland ranks
and condemned the University.
Martin would have been justified

in placing them in his “radical” '

wing.

One resident called Monto-
gomery a liar. Another chided
the Lniversity for having no re-
spect for the dead. One disgust-
ed resident likened the meeting
to a "melodrama. where we ap-
plaud the hero and boo the vil-
lian.“

New Rules

If what took place was a mel-
odrama. it is important to re-
member that the cit_y. for the
most part. managed the stage.

$$$

At the July 16 meeting, Pat-
ernoster revealed the city's po-
sition on the University’s expan-
sion plans. He said that, should
University architects decide to
transcend Pitt’s current boun-
daries, they “will subject them-
selves to a careful scrutiny by
the city.”

He added that any such move
would be expected to contain
significant community input.
Since the Phase I plan forced
Pitt to acquire new land. the
city would presumably have
given great credence to com-
munity objections.

Some Peoples Oakland mem-
bers seem to believe that the
University is yielding to city
and, or state pressure. rather than
to any interest in the welfare of
the community.

"The pressure they're respond-
ing to is not the community.“
said Fellner.

"They‘re responding to pres-
sure. not to any major restruct-
uring of the ideology of the ad-
ministration." said Boykowicz.

Martin conceded that in ad-
dition to the new community,
the University was “also res-
ponding to changes in city gov-
ernment.”

“The new government has
said.. ‘there are new rules un-
der which you‘re going to play
the game.”

Phoenix For Future

So the game has new rules and
new teams that. strangely en-
ough. will pitch in to scuttle a
ballpark.

Ascribing motives to Univer-
sity officials is a risky business.
one that probably is not ne-
cessary to predict the future.

The University has pledged
that it will acquire no more
community land. Given the new
city guidelines and the drama

He Wanted Friendship

 

-and notoriety of this confron-
tation.

by CINDY MORGAN

Franny never harmed anybody. He just limped across

the gravel parking lot. night after night. day after day. of-
fering his friendly conversation. and hoping to make new
friends.

For years I nodded hello. but made hasty retreats to
avoid anything further. Summers upon summers I watched
foolish high school girls laugh at his slow manner and his
stooped walk. They all flattered themselves to think that
they were too good for him. ‘

He only wanted to meet a nice girl. He was 28 and
very lonely. Most of his other friends had moved away and
were starting families of their own. Others had died. So he
hoped by hanging around the local ice cream drive—in that
perhaps the girl of his dreams would come along.

He saw me in that parking lot last Wednesday with my
date. He waved and began to talk, brushing a lock of dark
hair back from his forehead. We were a little confused, but
we started a conversation and found we had mutual friends.
He called me beautiful.

He asked if I knew any girls who weren‘t going with
someone. I said I didn't but told him to stop hanging around

the ice cream parlor and go to some dances. He smiled. and
knew I was probablyrright.

I soon realized how kind. how gentle. and how friendly

he was in a completely unphoney way. But his innocent eyes

blanketed me with an unexplainable sadness. As I drove
away. all I could do was mumble an embarrassed thank—you
as he threw away the dishes to the chocolate sundaes for us.

That was the last time I saw Franny, for two nights
later he was struck and killed by a pickup truck, long be-
fore the last ice cream cone had a chance to be served.

He never harmed anyone. he only wanted us to enjoy
ourselves. And most of all he wanted friendship. It is only
unfortunate that we became aware of it when it was too
late to do anyone any good.

Chucho Valencia and Gus
Theofilos will have a definite
affect as to how far the Pitt

soccer team will go this coming
year.

On Tuesday afternoon. both
of these athletes.were at Pitt
Stadium doing what comes nat-

“ural to them. kicking a ball. The

ball they were kicking. however.
was oval instead of round and
their accomplishments with it
were enough to awe Carl De-
Pasqua.

With about 50'. accuracy. they
zoomed the ball 45 yards ala
John White. often with many
yards to spare. ’

But all this was experimenta-
tion, for the athletes had one
thing on their minds, soccer.

On August 30. soccer practice
will begin and Leo Bemis has al-
ready sent typed sheets to his
players telling them what he ex-
pects.

The soccer hopefuls will be
required to do four 50 yard dash-
es that will be clocked. In addi-
tion. a six—minute mile will be

Page '6—PITT NEws—Tiaursday.t Jilly 29, 1971 ‘

required. The varsity average in
the mile should be about five

‘ and one half minutes.

Even though the requirements
seem tough, they are necessary
ones, according to Bemis, for a
school that hopes to go to the
NCAA soccer tournament.

The booters seem to have the
necessary talent returning to
making them a consistent win-
ner this year. The team has lost
only five players and with the
likes of Ali Rdisi. John White.
as well as Theofilos and Valen-
cia returning. an optimistic
Theofilos thought it necessary
to say: “If we don't make it this
year. we will never make it.“

Kerry Krause. Randy Dry.
Gerry Kruth. Dave Di Emedio.
and Tsima Lekoma are the grad-
uates that will no longer be
eligible to play.

Both Valencia and Theofilos
have been playing with a Greek
team at the stadium on Satur-
days and have been involved in
some pretty fair competition in-
cluding a 6-5 win over Youngs-
town last week.

Press Day to kick off Pitt‘s
1971 football season will be held
at 2 p.m.. August 19. in Pitt
Stadium. The squad of around
75-80 players will be available
to members of the media. for in-
terviews and pictures from 2-4
p.m. The players will be bussed
to Pitt-Johnstown campus later
that evening. and then will open
fall drills the following after-
noon. ‘

Pitt’s slugging first baseman,
Ken Macha, has placed highly
among the major college bat-
ting leaders for the 1971 base-
ball season. Macha, a junior
from Pittsburgh, was 14th in the
nation in hitting with a .415 av-
erage (34-82 in 24 games) and

' eighth in RBI’s with 31 for a

1.29 per game average. In help-
ing lead Pitt to a 18-8 record,
Macha also led the team in
home runs with seven and in
hits with 34.

Pitt’s Trees Hall will be the
site this Saturday of a training
clinic in ‘team handball‘. an
Olympic sport that has been
played outside the United States

‘for several years but was just

*

recently introduced to the Am-
erican public.

The clinic, which will start
at 10 a.m.. is being sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Team Hand-
ball Association in conjunction
with the Trees Hall Center for
the Development of Activity
Programs for the Exceptional
and the 99th U.S. Army Reserve
Command. It is open to the
public free of charge.

The main purpose of the clinic
is to expose athletic directors,
coaches, officials, and civic
groups to this relatively new
sport, an Olympic event which
the United States will enter for
the first time in the 1972 Gam-
es held in Munich, Germany.

A combination of basketball,
soccer. and volleyball. team
handball can be played either in-
doors our out, using a ball slight-
ly smaller and heavier than a
volle_vball. The object of the
game is to throw the ball past a
goalie into a net similar to those
used in ice hockey.

An added purpose for the
clinic is to interest enough peo-
ple to develop a pool of trained
athletes for’ the 1976 National
Olympic Team.

.but devastating satire on wire-

tapping, organized crime, the
police and the upper class lei-
surely way of life.

Craftily adapted by Frank
Pierson from the best selling no-
vel by Larry Sanders. the flick
is meticulously directed by Sid-
ney Lumet The Deadly Affair
and Bye, Bye Braverman.

The plot deals with the codly
calculated (by Sean Connery)
burglary of a posh Park Avenue
apartment house which is filled
with all kinds and types of elec-

tronic surveillance parapherna-
lia.

The movie gains momentum
as Connery plans the caper and
picks up in intensity as the plan
is put into effect. To tell more
would be to destroy the exciting
effect of this fine‘ film so I
won't say any more than to re-
commend it to anyone ‘who sav-
ors a realistic and suspenseful

ending. ’ _

Summing up: Cinematic crime
caper with plenty of substance
as well as suspense and pointed
satire.

W0mert’s Study

(Continued from Page 1)

Later Schneewind termed the
proposed program “a very good
way of getting a lot of depart-
ments to think about traditional
subjects in traditional ways. It
offers tremendous stimulus for
research." He added that the
University is the logical place
to begin much needed change
in the realm of women's equal-
ity.

“Indecent Haste”

Not all faculty members ap-
prove of the FASC’s decision.
Dr. Irwin Schulman of the Poli-
tical Science, Department, for
example, has reservations about
the program. Though he says

there is a need for study of wo-.

men's problems, he says, “Wom-

Plan

en's Studies as an academic
field is in danger of being a
joke. The movement has produc-
ed nothing of intellectual im-
portance.”

When confronted with this al-
legation. former ACWO Chair-
woman Mary Lou Burger re-
plied. "It seems to me there is a
lot of work that has to be done
in the field of study in the his-
torical and sociological tradi-

.tions of the oppression of wom-

en through domesticity. and if
this type of scholarship and re-
search is not iniated in a Uni-
versity setting — where else?"
Schulman also criticized the
Council for what he called its
"rapidfire approach": its deci-
sion he says was made in "in-
decent haste." ‘

“Frankly,” he said, “I don’t
understand why Schneewind was
in such haste to get the propos-
al passed. Perhaps he's afraid the
fad will peter itself out.”

When asked about Schulman’s
charges. Schneewind agreed that
the proposal was "pushed
through" rapidly. But he argued.
"After two years of giving cours-
es that were jammed every time
offered. it was evident that there
was a need for such a program.
The ACWO presented a proposal
and it was approved. It was such
an obvious case that it couldbe
decided very quickly."

Schneewind said that if the
faculty has any great objections
to the FASC decision. they can
arrangegto have it discussed at
a meeting of the Faculty of
Arts and Science this fall.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.
It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-

ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you’ a never

seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't

call it the Beetle anymore.

So we.gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks its ‘true identity, a new name.
We call it SUPER BEETLE. ,
