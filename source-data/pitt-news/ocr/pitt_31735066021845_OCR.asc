Penn State frat raids
worrying Pitt Greeks

By Marc Duchin
Staff Writer

Some Pitt fraternities have ex-

pressed concern over the charges
brought against 16 Penn State
fraternities for serving alcohol to
minors, according to Bridget
Guernsey, assistant director of
Pitt's student affairs.

‘Guernsey said that some frater-

, nity members are confused over

 

why the charges were made‘at
Penn State and are worried that
this type of action will become
common practice.

The Penn State fraternities were
charged after a two month police
investigation. ’

According to Police Chief El-
wood G. Williams, plain-clothes
officers collected information at
various fraternity parties. Charges
were filed in the office of District
Magistrate Clifford Yorks against
the 16 fraternities named in the
investigation. Citations Summons
have also been sent to about 25
people for. sewing alcohol to
minors.

”It’s about 20 steps backwards
in cooperation” between student
government and the State College

Borough, said Craig Miller,«

University Student Executive
Council adviser.

The fraternities charged are: Pi
Lambda Phi, Tau Kappa Epsilon,
Sigma. Phi Epsilon, Theta Delta
Chi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Nu,

Alpha Chi Rho, Beta Sigma Beta,
Kappa Sigma, Phi Mu Delta, Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon, Phi Kappa
Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Pi,
Acacia and Phi Kappa Tau.

According to a formal state-
ment released by Penn State offi-
cials, ”While in the fraternities,
observations were made of the
bar areas and, when persons who
were believed to be under the

ageof ‘21 were served alcohol, ,

they were followed and identified
by uniformed officers outside the
building.”

Earl Good, president of Penn

‘State's Acacia fraternity, said he

is still unsure what the ramifica-
tions will be, but said, ”I think it’s
going to force the fraternities to
do something.”

President of Beta Sigma Beta

fraternity, Simon Viff, said the In-
terfraternity Council asked him
not to comment on the charges.

‘Craig Jackson, public relations
for Pitt's IFC, said Pitt's dry rush
has been effective in curbing un-
deraged drinking.

”The good thing about dry rush

is the guys‘ that are rushing are the
guys that are really interested and
not the guys that paid five bucks
in the beginning of the term and
-then drank for three weeks,” said
Jackson. ”It gets the beer-
guzzling down, and it gets the
brothers motivated to meet the
guys.”

Youth arrested after PPC concert

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer ’

I A 16-year-old Swissvale youth
was arrested by University of

, Pittsburgh Police on charges of

disorderly conduct and simple as-
sault Friday night.

The juvenile, a sophomore ‘at
Swissvale High School, was
threatening passersby with a knife
at the corner of Fifth Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard.

. When the arresting officers at-

. tempted to disarm the youth, he

lunged toward_them, wounding
one of them. Officers said the boy
was behaving in a violent and
psychotic manner.

The youth was believed to
have been in Oakland attending
a ”Friday the 13th” concert spon-
sored by Pitt Program Council in
the Assembly Room of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. '

youths.

I The juvenile reportedly was re-. _

moved from the William Pitt Un-
ion after he began removing his
clothes by the" elevators on the
main floor.

After he wasapprehended, the
youth was taken to Presbyterian-

vation.

Increase in local fires sparks prevention awareness

By Michelle Quinn
Staff Writer

Due to a recent rise in local
fires, there has been a growing
need for the awareness of fire
prevention, according to local fire
officials. '

According to firefighter Joe
”Sparky” Parks of Engine Compa-
ny 14, the majority of fires are
caused by smouldering cigar-
ettes, televisions and grease fires.

”People don't pull the plug out
from their TVs after they're done
using them or at night before they
go to sleep,” Parks said. ”|fthere
is anything defective in the TV or
there is a power surge, the vacu-
um tube will just explode, send-
ing ‘shrapnel’ everywhere."

Many fires are caused by smol-
dering cigarettes.

'”Kids have parties and, when

Pitt falsealarms a. problem

Parks said the easiest way to

combat a grease fire is to keep the I

lid of the pot or pan within reach.

”They think it is a big damn
joke. They don't realize that
while we are out answering
the false alarm, we could be
called for a real fire,” Parks
said. ’’If one of our guys gets

Africans
possibly
predated
Columbus

By Jack Burkman

Sta ff Writer

Blacks from Africa came to the
Western Hemisphere long before
Columbus, according to world-
renowned anthropologist Ivan
Van Sertima, who recently gave
a lecture to Pitt's Black Action
Society.

”Columbus himself said that
there were Africans in America
before him,” Van Sertima said.
”There is evidence that blacks
were traveling from Western Afri-
ca to the Carribean long before
the slave trade.”

Recent studies substantiate Van
Sertima’s contention, he said.
Botanists have found that the two
most popular kinds of American
cotton are indigenous to North-
west Africa and not I North
America. ‘,

Despite such evidence, Van
Sertima admitted many American
and European schools remain un-
convinced. He attributed this
skepticism to the limited nature
of the studies done on African‘
culture. .

”We must look at Africa. in a
new light," he said. ”When one

studies Africa, he, traditionally, '
always studies the worst. Recent *

research has revealed that Afri-
ca‘ns have used advanced tech-
nology for years.” 4
According to Van Sertima, one
never ”hears of Africa's contribu-
tion to the modern world.” He
K pointed out thatmany anthropol-
ogists contend that Africans had

terparts.

”We now know beyond the‘ I
shadow of a questionable »

doubt,”-Van Sertima said, ”that
homo-sapiens originated in cen-
tral Africa.”

This, Van Sertima argued,

proves conclusively the absurdi-
ty of racial discrimination.

”Co|or change was the result of
genetic mutation and variations
in climate. Humans are one fami-
ly,” he said.

Brant added that Penn State's
‘situation will not necessarily
cause local police forces at other
colleges to take similar action.

- ”The more we can share infor-
mation, both positive’ and un-
desirable, the more educational
it is going to be for others. I think

Nothing more or
less than racism

The Ku Klux Klan, for almost a century, has been advocating
the use of violence to promote thesuperiority of the white race,
which they feel is their right. In 1981, a young black man was
found mutilated, hanging from a tree. A damage settlement of
$7 million has been awarded to the family of the man and the
NAACP.

The incident in question is now history. No amount of money
can ever bring the man, Michael Donald, back. No amount
of money can ever ease his family's suffering. Yet, even with
the outrage exposed and the KKK proven guilty, the organiza-
tion /continues to operate.

The KKK continues to meet, to plan violence, to hate. The

‘ goals they/"express are ‘those’ of violence‘. In case noonehas

taken the time to explain the lawto them, violence is illegal
— as is terrorism and murder. Yet the Klan continues to exist.

Were a group of people to get together and to plan a bank
robbery, they would probably be arrested for conspiring to com-
mit a crime. Robbery is a crime. Why is the KKK, with the vio-

'lence inherent in the order, still permitted to meet and to kill?

By standing by, allowing the KKK to continue it's bloody treck
through history, we are sanctioning violence and promoting
hatred. There is no infringement of freedom in not allowing
a groupto kill people.

The time has long since passed for us to outlaw the KKK. They
have shown active and visible tendencies toward racial vio-
-lence. They and their mindless hatred have nothing to offer this
country and should not be permitted to exist within our socie-
ty. Constitutional freedom doesn't include the freedom to mu-
tilate another person in the name of nothing but predjudice.

Back in October of last year, to the Allocations Committee for

the current Student Government
President Phil Moyer was cam-
paigning for making the Student
Government Board more student-
oriented. The "open door” poli-
cy (office hours Monday and
Wednesday 3-4, Thursday 1-5) he
adopted and instituted was part
of his platform, as was a more
controversial issue, that of raising
the Student Activities Fee. Moy-
er feels there is a dire need [for]
"strengthening programming

.-"capabilities of student organi-
'zations."

The Student Activities Fee goes
to pay for the programs of student
organizationson campus. In the
words offormer SGB President.

Jim Mumma, these organizations .
”provide arsourcezof education, I"
V - enjoyment «and. friendship.’-'  it

The fee is divided [among] the

SGB, the Pitt Program Council .
and Media"a'nd'PubI‘ications. {-...] -4‘
Once the percentage of funds is
handed out, the SGB monies go

distribution.

The reason for the proposed in-
crease is the gap between monies
requested by student groups and
the monies available. Last year
the gap was immense — a
$600,000 difference between
[existing and requested funds].

The amount of organizations
that Pitt has is large and diverse.
The fee goes to pay for programs
such as PPC's movies and lecture

series, Greek Week, the Black ‘

Action Society, honorary, aca-
demic, ethnic and sports groups
and charity events. There simply
are not enough funds ;to “meet

everyone’s requests. Hence, the

need to‘ increase the fee.

The Dead come to life

The Grateful Dead. If they're
dead, why are they so damn hap-
py? Happy, nothing. They're
downright grateful. The original
nihilists, right?

I like the Dead. I'm happy. I'm.

also not dead. Nor am I a "dead
head.” I just like their music.
When someone asks me what my
favorite band is, and I tell them

--it's the Dead, they look at me

kind of funny. Like I be a drug ad-
dict, or worse.

I don't know if you've ever
seen someone try to look for nee-
dle tracks in your arms without
being obvious, but it can't be
done. A bunch of folks just seem
to associate the Dead with every-
thing their parents told them not
to do.

I have to wonder if maybe their
parents told them to ignore good
music because the Dead certain-
ly make good music. I'd go as far
as saying that they're the best
thing ever to happen to vinyl.

You like to dance? You can
dance to the Dead. You like to
party? You can definitely party to
the Dead. You like concerts? The

Therese McFadden puts it. Simi-
lar funding is a comparative look
at the Urban 13 schools to see
where Pitt stands in regard to stu-
dent activities fee amounts, dis-
tribution and increases.

In short, the study has shown
Pitt's activities fee is comparable

If there were to be an award for

in the history of the planet, it
would probably be the Dead.

I'll sometimes ask a person if
they happen to share my taste in

abortion because they believe the
fetus experiences pain. This is a
very valid possibility but, in any
case, it must be weighed against
the suffering of the unexpected

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, ‘February ‘I6, I987 A

Hey! Get me a real man  

Men, men, men.

Girls, girls, girls.

What's wrong with this
already? *

The first woman and man got
us all off to a pretty bad start. Eve
tempted Adam, or was Adam so
stupid he fell for it?

What? It should read, ”man
and woman,” right? Does it
bother you? A writing instructor
of mine last term typed ”she or
he” on a piece of paper instead
of the conventional ”he or she”
and confessed he re-typed it be-
cause it bothered him.

It doesn't bother me.

' In fact, it seems like a lot of
things bother ”men.” A person I
know tells a female friend of
mine she should let her hair grow
longer because it would look bet-
ter that way.

He seems entirely obsessed
with how a woman should and
should not look:

”She’s short, she has buck
teeth, and she's got no chest,” he
describes another female.

But what do you expect from
a guy who likes a pop ”tart”, like
Madonna? ‘ '

Women should shave. Of
course. It kills me when I hear
someone say a woman should
shave for hygienic purposes. If
that be true, let the man shave his
legs and underarms, too. Let him
cut his knees and sting his unde-
rarms when he uses deodorant.

A lot of men_ I know have

    

 

. '- ‘. ..

definite criteria a woman must
follow to beacceptable. Not all,

' but a lot.

‘ The most sickening part is that
some women give in to silly
demands.

I have seen intelligent women '

act like complete dumb—asse5 just
so they are-not viewed .as
threatening to a man. They are
blond, so they feel compelled to
act like a dumb blond.

The aggressive woman is a
bitch, a tyrant.

The aggressive
succeed.

This sure isn't true. But too
many people, both men and
women, believe it.

Enough preaching already.‘ All
of these scenarios are cliches.

But they are cliches which
should have long since disap-
peared from our society.

man will

What keeps this attitude alive?
How about shows like, Drearri
Cirl, U.S.A.? This has got to be
the most ridiculous show on tel-
evision next to Dance Fever.
Each week, four girls compete in
a pseudo beauty pageant to vie
for a spot in the coveted Dream
Girl, U.$'.A. finals which will
eventually determine who will be
”dream girl USA." Need I say
more? ,

Or ho_w about the Love Con-
nection hosted by Chuck
Woolery? This is nothing but a
televised meat-market auction.

Solid Gold? Well, they do play
some music. But those dancers,
those women dancers, look like
their costumes came out of a
Kleenex tissue box.

And back to Madonna. Why
doesn't she present the image of
a real woman? She's got a mean
and nasty husband who will fight _
to protect her honor, she claims"

.she’s just like a virgin, and she

wears pasties. And just who is
this Samantha Fox who can't sing
worth a damn? Great bod’, they
say. .
I guess we can_ blame it on
good ol’ television.

Where else can we have vicar-
ious sex, vicarious fantasy, vicar-
ious excitement and a vicarious
presentation of how a woman
should be.

So guys, why don't you go read
some books? Television has af-
fected your mind too much.

Nicked by aclose shave

Upon my first encounter with
the disposable razor, I thought of
the Beaver.

. I pictured Theodore stumbling
onto Wally’s shaving kit while
June and Ward were attending a
PTA meeting or something. The
Beaver would be staring into the

bathroom mirror, his face and‘

shirt collar lush with lather, when
Larry‘ would say something like,
”Geez, Beav, I dunno.” But the
Beaver would slowly draw the
blade to his cheek, managing to
dart holes all over his face before
Wally came home from basket-
ball practice.

The Beav wouldbe canonized
the following day - at school;
Whitey would share his baloney
sandwich for the honor of sitting
near him at the lunch table. He
would stay king until Eddie
Haskell brought the matter to
Mrs. Cleaver’s attention before
dinner, at which time Theodore
would be sent to his room for one
of those unavoidable talks.

I had never applied a disposa-
ble razor to my face until last
Thursday night. I was weaned on
an electric -razor, and by last

I Count, we have'three electric

razors in our bathroom closet, an
average of 1.5 razors per person

the blades, the sight of tissue-
paper wads on his face was
enough deterence for us.

But I was desperate. My side-
burns looked like truck ramps.
And the electric razors never
completely cleared my neck.
One package contained yellow
razors for sensitive skin. The
other held blue double-edged
razors. Impulsively, I went for the
yellow.

They don't print directions on

the packages, but I followed my

hunch I should lather up before

the act itself. I washed with soap"

and hotwater, smeared Rise all

sidering pulling the plug forever.

But first, I wanted to try the blue ‘

double-edged razors.

The first rule of shaving, ldis-
covered, is not to succomb to
overconfidence.

The cheeks were easy; the neck
was not. I raced the dual blades
around my collar, which left lit-

' tle red specks all over my neck.

The specks increased in size un-
til they became spots and
splotches, and eventually they
began to drip. I had incurred
seven leaks. I grabbed the nearest
towel and pressed it to my neck.
Soon it was considerably stained

v with blood.

Coco, our white Maltese, sat on
the ‘carpet outside the bathroom
door and looked at me with his

I head cocked. I didn't want -to '

bleed on him, so I kicked the
door closed in his face.

I finally stopped the bleeding
and completed the shave without
requiring a paramedic. The blood
holes turned to neat scabs, which
wouldn't be extremely noticeable

were made with crayons.

We received the piece of J
paper last year. .It was a gift

,   . non GREENE
rom a little boy named

 
Schuyler Stephens. I wrote

about Schuyler last February; he was 4 years old and suffered
from a liver defect known as alpha-I antitrypsin deficiency. He
was in need of a liver transplant. . 1

Before writing about Schuyler, I made numerous phone calls
to his mother, Patricia Stephens. She talked to Julie and me so
often that it seemed as if the three of us were friends. After the.
column appeared, Schuyler drew the picture and asked his
mother to send it to us. .

Julie posted it on the glass wall. It stayed there, as a kind of
silent prayer that Schuyler would get a new liver and that every-
thing would be all right.

Schuyler, indeed, received a liver transplant. In fact, he
received two. The first operation took place on Nov. 24, but
‘there were problems. The second liver transplant took place
last Thursday. There were more problems. At 1 I :30 last Satur-
day night, Schuyler died in Pittsburgh's Children's Memorial
Hospital. .

”Schuyler and I had been discussing what might happen ever
since he was old enough to talk,” his mother said. ”His grand- »
mother passed away, so he knew what death was. He knew

' that if things didn't work out, he would go to live with Grand-

ma and God.”

The surgical procedures were arduous. The first transplant
operation lasted 12 hours. The second lasted 15 hours. ”The.
doctors expected him to die several times,” his mother said...
”But he was so strong, he was fighting so hard. He was trying
desperately to breathe.”

Mrs. Stephens has been in Pittsburgh since November, when
the first operation took place. ”Schuy|er never cried,” she said.
”That was the amazing thing. With all that he was going
through, he never cried once. He would look at me, and I
couldn't help myself — the tears would be running down my
face. And he'd say, ‘Don't cry, Mommy.’ ”

Toward the end, Schuyler could not even talk to his mother.
”There’s this thing called a ventilator,” she said. ”It’s a tube V
that they put down the patient’s throat and into the lungs. They
had to use that on Schuyler. He couldn't speak because of the
ventilator. But he could look me in the eyes and shake his head
’yes’ or ‘no.’ If you look into someone’s eyes, you can know

' what he's feeling.”

Schuyler never became angry at the doctors or nurses. ”He
knew that they had to do things that would hurt him. Because
if they didn't, then he'd have no chance,” his mother said. ”He
didn't complain about it.” _ ' .

- On the last night, Mrs. Stephens sat in Schuy|er’s hospital
room and held his hand. He was hooked up to a series of mo-
nitors, and shecould tell by looking at the monitors that his"
body was failing fast.
”He was gripping my hand as hard as he could,” she said.
”He was struggling to breathe. Finally, I leaned over to him and
I whispered, ‘Schuyler, it's time to stop fighting.’ ”

When it happened, Mrs. Stephens was ready. ”Do you know
in the movies, how the wiggly line on the monitor goes
straight?” she said. ”That’s how it happened. All of the sudden

‘ the line on the monitor went completely straight, and at that

exact moment, Schyuler released his grip on my hand."

Mrs. Stephens didn't leave the room right away. ”It’s kind _
of hard to pull yourself out of there," she said. ”Your chiId.’s 
body is still there, but you know that your child is not really

there any longer. You don't want to- leave. But eventually, you  ~ .' ; 

. have to." J _ . - ~~ ‘ 1 ,

Misconceptions often
worsen college stress

' By Brenda McGuirk

For The Pitt News

College can be a very stressful
time in one's life. Leaving home,
making new friends and adjusting
to college work are a few of the
new problems facing students.
Six years ago, the University of

Pittsburgh's Health Education-

Office began a» program that

If offers‘ SlIl’€SS management COUl'S€S

to help students deal with stress.

Shona Sharif, a graduate stu-
dent with a master's degree in
health management, got involved
in the program this year because
she was interested in helping stu-
dents gain control of their lives.

Sharif stresses that bad eating
and sleeping habits and a lack of
exercise contribute to the damag-
ing effects stress has on a person's
body. Roommate conflicts, a part-
time job and the fear of failing a
class can also greatly increase the
stress in a student's life.

Symptoms of stress include the
need to run and hide, an impulse
to cry, lack of concentration,
trembling and pains in the back
and neck. lrritability, changes in
appetite and impulsive behavior
are also signs.

”Most students don't [realize]
the reason they are sleepy, irrita-
ble, or nervous is a combination
of things,” said Sharif. ”lf you
have a tough test coming, you
may stay up all night studying
and drinking a lot of [caffienated
beverages].”

Sharif said a student make think
he feels terrible because he was
just worried about a test. ”He
doesn't see the actions surround-
ing studying for a test as stressful
to the body. I want students to see
the harmful effects of 9 their
lifestyle and scare them into con-

, trol of their lives,” she added.

.— In 1986, 1_71 students were in-
volved in the program. This num-
ber i_nc|udes student groups who
asked Sharif to speak to them. At
a university as large as Pitt, Sharif
said that she would expect the
student involvement to be great-
er. ”But students often’ ignore
the,ir personal growth and are
insecure about seeking help for
personal problems,” she said.

Some students believe that they
have to pay for the classes or that

they don't have time for them._

Some simply don't know the
courses exist, said Sharif. _
To increase campus awareness

of the program, the Health Edu-
cation Office advertises in The

Pitt News and places brochures
in the William Pitt Union and in
the student health center.

The classes «show students what

‘stress does to the body. High

blood pressure, ulcers, alco-
holism, insomnia and migraine
headaches are some common
problems caused by stress and an
unhealthy lifestyle.

Sharif helps students identify
what stressors are in their lives
and how they physically react to
them. She also teaches students
how to relax and how to avoid
the ”stress response" that occurs
when a person gets nervous, mad
or upset.

Sara (whose name was_
changed by request), a Pitt junior,
took the class to learn how to
cope with problems. ”Stress was
getting in the way of my life. I
knew it was there, but I didn't
know what to do about it,” she
said. Sara's stress symptoms were
head and stomachaches and
sweaty palms.

Sharif teaches relaxation exer-
cises to stop such reactions to
stress. She said getting mad or up-
set is OK as long as you can calm
down and forget about what is
bothering you. '

According to Sharif, it is when

a person can't relax that stress be-
comes harmful, because the body

keeps getting excited and can't _

function normally.

Sleep, eating and exercise con-
tribute to the body's ability to
handle stress. Sharif recommend-
ed drinking juice or water instead
of drinking soda or coffee. ”Even
if you have to pay 15 extra cents
for juice instead of buying a
cheaper soda, it's worth it,”...she
said.

Sharifis a firm believer in eat-
ing right and getting regular
sleep. ”Your‘ body has its own
pattern. If you disturb it because
of a stressful situation, it only
makes matters worse.

if you are in control of your
body, stress won't hurt it as
much,” she said. ’’If you can re-
lax and resistthe stress response,
you'll be healthier.” Besides a
proper diet, Sharif said time
management, exercise and ra-
tional thinking are essential in a
student's life-

The stress management class is
offered this term during February

and March. It meets for an hour‘

and 15 minutes a week for four
weeks and is free to Pitt students.

”Always keep a flashlight han-

”Wave the flashlight back and

If the door is not warm, he said,

Blacks protest diminished  
political clout in Alabama

By Kendal Weaver

Associated Press Writer

MONTGOMERY, Ala. —
About 2,000 marchers protesting.

diminished black political clout
in the Statehouse and an ”anti-
black attitude” in the White
House rallied at the Alabama
Capitol on Saturday.

”My objective here is to re-
juvenate Martin Luther King's
strategies,” said the Rev. Hosea
Williams of Atlanta, who joined
Alabama black leaders in the pro-
test. ’’It's time again for non-
violent direct action. Back to the
streets.”

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
missed the march but arrived to
speak from the Capitol steps, tar-

geted Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt
for failing to give blacks a sub-
stantial role in his new Republi-
can administration.

”Governor Hunt, this is Valen-
tine’s Day,” said the 1984
Democratic presidential primary
candidate. ”This is a day to be
loving, a day to mend broken
hearts.  You've driven an arrow
into hearts on Valentine's Day.”

Hunt, the first Republican
governor of Alabama this centu-
ry, has said repeatedly his ad-
ministration will be ”co|orblind.”
He met two days ago with black
mayors from Alabama, who

, praised his economic policies but

criticized him for appointing only
one black to his cabinet.

Most protesters’ placards fo-
cused on the reduction of key

committee assignments for blacks
in the new state Legis|_ature ‘ses-
sion, but Williams, an Atlanta city

councilman who has led recent

protests in Georgia, said they

were also part of ”a new move- A
_ment afoot across America.”

”The focal point must end up
being Ronald Reagan  and the
anti-black attitude he projects,”
Williams said. That attitude, he
said, has allowed the Ku Klux
Klan ”to rear its ugly head again.”

Organizers expected as many
as 3,000 people to attend the

march. Several hundred began-

the march, and their ranks
swelled as the march proceeded.

The National Heart, Lung and -

Blood lnstitute recently awarded
the University of Pittsburgh's
School of Medicine $2.7 million

to begin a seven-year nationwide .

1 study aimed at the prevention of
_ Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Diseases.

Pitt is one of 10 institutes in-
volved in the study. Others in-
clude John Hopkins Hospital and
the University of California at Los
Angeles.

' COPDS, such as asthma,
chronic bronchitis and emphyse-
ma, are the fifth leading cause of
death in the United States. In
spite of the recent decline in
some heart diseases, the fatality
rate of COPD has steadily in-

creased. This rise is due, in part, ’

ram cw

PLACE -

 

 

to the lung damage caused by
smoking. It has been determined
that cigarette smoking is the lead-
ing cause of COPD. V
Robert M. Rogers, M.D., chief
of pulmonary medicine at the

University of Pittsburgh School of’

Medicine, said, ”This,study

hopes to determine if the best _

method for slowing down the
decline of pulmonary function as-
sociated with COPD is a combi-
nation . of smoking cessation
[either by a gradual or cold tur-
key approach] and bronchodila—
tor drug treatment or smoking
cessation alone.”

Although behavioral and psy-
chological motivation have previ-
ously gained the highest rate.of
smoking cessation, a new bron-
chodilator drug may change
these trends. , .

Due out April 1, Atrovent is

designed to serve as ‘a throat
relaxant. It will be used in this
study.

While even non-smokers be-
tween the ages of 35 and 59
Suffer from rapid pulmonary func-
tion deterioration, the main focus
of this study will be with the
smoker.

”Rapid decline‘in pulmonary
functionsand smoking go hand
in hand,” said Donna Caruthers,
research associate at the school
of medicine and project director.

The study will compare the loss
of lung function found in the
Smoker with that of the non-
smoker. Caruthers added, ”We
want to reduce the deterioration
of the pulmonary functions in the
smoker and parallel it with the
course of the non-smoker of the
Same age.”

Debating
not for  

‘Nerds’

By Dan Maney
For The Pitt News I

:0 --:Carl« Craver, ‘a philosophy;

major, ”liked sports but wanted
to do something that was off the
beaten path.” So he followed a
suggestion made by his middle
school history teacher and took

up debate. Nearly six years later, .

Craver is now one of the two de-
baters on Pitt's varsity debate
team. V

Craver, from Marysville, Ohio,
said he wanted to attend Pitt be-
cause of its good philosophy
department and because the de-
bate team has such an excellent
history, especially after winning
the National Tournament in
l98_].

posing President Reagan's policy
in Nicaragua, in part because of
his Vietnam experience.

”Vietnam gives me greater
pause to reflect that when you
commit troops or surrogates, it
better be a last resort,” he said.

Platoon follows a boot-camp
graduate off the transport plane
and into the horrors of the war.
Ridge, 41, has no quarrel with the
appearance of the film — the jun-
gles, the insects and leeches, the
camouflaged bunkers and
booby—traps.

’’It showed the nights, which
were so clear you probably can't
imagine. There were no lights for

  

hundreds of miles around, just‘

the iridescence of the moon and
stars.”

V Ridge’s problems with the film '

l.ie in the way the tension, anger
and fear of the war are shown to
result in Americans brutalizing

' villagers and finally each" other.

’.’You go into a village after one
of your guys has been shot, and
you're mad, you're scared.
Maybe someone drags a guy in
for interrogation and yells and
screams,” he said.

But the film goes so far in
depicting /‘the inhuman ele-
ment,” according to Ridge, that
he almost walked out of the theat-
er. He said he thinks of the
58,000 names of the dead on the
polished wall of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial.

”They probably didn't do any
of the stuff in that movie. It up-

sets me. I think Hollywood has -
exploited the tension and made,

it inhuman and barbaric and
cruel,” he said.

Ridge said he had recently seen
the film and had not yet dis-
cussed his feelings with a loose-
knit group of 12 House and five
Senate members who served in
Southeast Asia. Many of the 17
are also members of the larger
and more formal Vietnam .Era
Veterans Caucus, which includes
veterans who'were not on active
status and those not sent to the
ﬁghﬁng.

' Like Ridge, many in the smaller
group saw combat. Ridge, who
had never fired a rifle before he
was drafted, was given an outpost
with several Americans and a

company of Vietnamese. He was , 2

not injured during the war.
But he added, ”Vietnam vete-
rans don’t have to go to a movie

V to‘ relive it. We don't need mo- _

__vies. In Vietnam, there were 3 .

million stories, and there's not

one movie that can reflect those.”

The Penn State Nittany Lions
have defeated a Pitt Panther team
once again this year. This time it
was their wrestlingteam that
handed Pitta 32-17 loss Saturday
night at Peters Township High
SchooL

The loss dropped the Panthers,
ranked 17 nationally, to 10-3

overall and 2-3 in the Eastern
Wrestling League. Penn State im-
proved to 15-1-1 and 3-0.

"1 have mixed emotions after
this one,” said Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. "l was happy
that the score was close, but I
think that a couple of our guys
could have done better. A few
wrestled without any intensity.”

The second-ranked Nittany
Lions started off fast. At 118

pounds,'PSU’s Jim Martin blew
out Pitt's Matt Rizzo 18-3. This

What in the world went on
at Fitzgerald Saturday night? A
Pitt-Boston College game go-
ing into double overtime? The
most exciting Pitt basketball
game in years? Against the
same BC that's won only two
Big East games all year?
Against the same BC that the
Panthers whipped by 18 only
three weeks ago?

You bet.

Despite the mismatch on
parchment, Jim O’Brien’s Ea-

. glesgave Pitt the game of their
lives, as the two teams threw
a roundball surprise party that
nobody expected. It was "The
Thrillah on the Hillah," with
Pitt sneaking away a 72-67
victor. A

Post-game interviews rev-
ealed two clearly unhappy
coaches — one because his
team came up short again —
Boston College has now lost
nine games by 10 points or
less —— and the other because
his club almost gave away th
night's door prize. ‘

Said a hoarse, defeated
O'Brien, "This was just a very,
very disappointing loss. We
played as hard as we could.
You know, you don't get too
many chances to beat a great
team like Pitt very often, and
we had our chance tonight.
We played pretty damn well,
regardless.”

"lt's good to come away
with a win, but we played very
poorly,” said an equally sullen
Paul Evans. ''It reminded me
of how we played in the St.
John's game. They controlled
the tempo out there most of
the time...But as»bad as we

played, we had some good
performances ' down the
stretch.”

The stretch? Before getting
into the details of multi-climax
ending, let's find out why
there even was a stretch, for
this game was supposed to be
kaput before halftime."

Back in January, Pitt pound-
ed the Eagles inside on both
ends of the court. So O'Brien,
instead of shying away and go-
ing with Dana Barros’ outside
bombing, sent his troops into
the core of the key to battle
Pitt's monsters.

A combination of hot BC
shooting and freezing -Pitt
"projections directed some-
where near the rim" gave the
Eagles a surpising 33-31 lead
at the half. Boston College

_ shot a nifty 60-percent from

the field, hitting 14 of v23‘at-
tempts, while Pitt converted
only 11 of 31. The strange
thing was that most of the Pan-
thers’ shots were inside the
key, at point—blan_k range.‘
Only a decent performance
by center Charles Smith (12.
points in the half) kept Pitt
even that close.

The second half was an all-
out tug—of—war. The Eagles’

Skip Barry, Jamie Benton, and

Tyrone Scott combined for 14 _
points, and at the 12:01 mark
BC was up by six. Pitt was

.looking awfully ragged and

stale. They needed a spark to‘
ignite themselves and the
fiesty crowd onhand.

Luckily, Rod Brookin
brought the lighter.

The freshman forward, sub-
bing for Demetreus Gore,
found himself a picnic spot on
the left baseline and feasted on

An interesting bunch, this Pitt

' basketball team. Interesting, in-.

deed. Before the season began,
many believed the Panthers had
the talent to be where they are to-
day -— ranked in the Top 10 of
the country, 21-4 overall and
growling atop first place in the
Big East with a 10-2 record and
an eight-game win streak.

But it is the way this high-

. flying, rim-rattling group of play- -

ers has achieved its success that
is so intriguing.

And that couldn't have been
more evident than it was on
Saturday night when the Panthers
found a way to beat Boston Col-
lege 72-67 in double-overtime,
when a loss seemed nothing
short of a sure thing.

Panther freshman Rod Brookin

was mainly responsible for this _

victory. The 6-5 forward con-

tinued his season-long clutch
play, hitting a three-pointer with
three seconds left in the first over-
time to tie the game and force
another extra session.

in that second session, JeROME
Lane took over, sweeping the
glass for four more rebounds to
add to his game-high total of 19,
scoring the basket that put Pitt
ahead to stay and bringing down
the house with a fearsome dunk
on a four-on-one break.

Almost. Lane missed the dunk,
which would usually spark the ire
of Pitt coach Paul Evans. But not
this time. ’’I really couldn't be
that upset [with him] because he
was rebounding like a bitch. He
really got the kids fired up,” said
Evans. '

Lane did have one flaw in his
game. He shot a miserable 3-8

from the line, including two

missing their foul shots. Usually
the team that makes its foul shots
wins the close ‘games. Obvious-
ly, Pitt doesn't suscribe to that
theory.

But_ their ineptitude from the
foul line in the clutch has
produced numerous theoretical
discoveries on this writer's part.

BTU nexpected form u la makes Pitt a win ne r

produce. Pittwill need his ser-
vices dearly in the Big East and
NCAA tournaments.

0 Feb. 4 at Villanova. Lane and
Brookin go to the line for one-
and—ones with Pitt clinging to a
one-point lead with under a
minute left. Both miss, but center
Charles Smith saves the day,
blocking a shot by Harold Jensen
with 10 seconds left. Theory No.
2 — Smith doesn't always need
to score points in abundance for
this team to win, as evidenced by
the Panthers 7-1 record when he
scores 12 points or less. He does
need to utilize his shot-blocking
abilities in clutch situations and
stay out of foul trouble, though.

0 Saturday night at Fitzgerald
Field House. In the last 10:58 of
the game, the Panthers shoot 3
for 12. Yes, three for 12 from the
foul line. Reserve center Tico
Cooper starts the bad trend when
he misses two one-and-ones with
11 and seven seconds left in regu-
lation. Theory No. 3 —- Some-
times it's better to be lucky than
good. .

Believe me, the Panthers are
good, but they have won a hand-
ful of games that easily could
have gone the other route.

Surprisingly, though, Pitt's rise
to the class of the nation's elite
teams has been accompanied by
rather unexpected seasonal per-
formances (both good and bad)
from some of its top players.

lane has been the key. The
multi-talented star has all the

tools to perform as he has. The -

only thing that's shocking is that
he has done it everygame this
year. Lane has scored in double
figures 24 out of 25 games and
has had 10 rebounds or more in
22 out of 25 games. He simply
hasn't had a bad game this
season.

However, the biggest surprise
has been the guard play and the
small forward spot. Aiken has had
four straight single-digit scoring
games.and has only made 12
three-pointers in 12 Big East
games. His scoring average has
dipped below 17‘ a game, after
returning from the Rainbow Clas-
sic in Hawaii in December with

a 23 point average. Goodson

knows Aiken’s problem. ”Once‘
he misses his first couple shots he
stops shooting,” said Goodson.
”Curtis has got to build his con-
fidence up. He's got to keep
shooﬁngf’ ’

Meanwhile, Goodson, who
people said didn't need to score
for Pitt to _win, is averaging 10
points a game and leads the team
in three-point field goals in Big
East play.

Brookin, whose nickname
”Rockin” should quickly be
replaced with the tag ”lce,” is
averaging almost nine a game in
the league. _

The most shocking statistic of
all, though, is that Gore, Pitt's
leading-scorer last season, is only
the sixth-leading scorer on the
Panther. team in conference
games.'Wow! .

Obviously, Paul Evans has.

Game

Continued from page 13

the Boston College zone -with
several bullseye 1 7-footers.

”|’ve been working on that shot
a lot in practice. I'm really com-
fortable with it,” he said. Come
overtime, Brookin showed just
how comfortable he was.

Now for the stretch. With 6:07
remaining, Pitt had clawed back
to take a three point lead, 53-50.
Jerome Lane was rebounding

' everything in sight— he finished
the game with 19 —— including a
errant Panther shot that was head-
ed out of bounds. Laneigrabbed
that one at the last second, and
while falling backwards, spun

and whipped the MacGregor out’

to guard Mike Goodson who was
situated near half-court. Pitt re-
tained a crucial possession.

The Panthers led by one going
into the final minute when
Brookin fed inside to Lane, who
was fouled. He converted the
first, then blew the second. Little
did Lane know that he was setting
a trend of misses that would cost
the Panthers victory in regulation
and in the first overtime.

The Eagles came down the
floor, dilligently working for a de-
cent last shot.‘ Finally Benton,
BC’s version of ”lronhead” Hey-
ward, missed a short jumper and
Tico Cooper grabbed the board.
In the game for a fouled-out
Smith, Cooper made perhaps the
biggest play of his career. He was
quickly fouled at 0:11, and Pan-
ther fans thought this one was fi-
nally over.

Not 50. Cooper went from hero
to ”ancient Chinese billygoat” as
he missed both foul attempts. BC

had the ball for one last shot.

Barros took the outlet and
drove the length of the floor,
while Goodson forced him into
the corner with tight ”D”. Whis-
tle! With one second on the
clock, a foul was charged to
Goodson. ”That was a terrible
call,” he said. ’’I didn't even
touch Barros. The refs made that
one to keep Boston College in the
game.”

Whatever, Barros nailed both
and the teams went into OT.

The first overtime was a series
of fouls. Twice Lane missed the
front end of one-and-ones. Then
with only 12 seconds remaining,
the Eagles were up one and had
possession of the ball. Pitt had to
foul and Gore sent Benton to the
line. Benton hit both, and BC led
by three.

An upset? Well, Pitt still had

time to launch a three-pointer
and tie it up. Taking the ball at
midcourt, Curtis Aiken headed
towards the foul line, where he
ran into traffic. While the defense
was concentrating on "Aiken,
Brookin (remember him?) posi-
tioned himself in that left corner
just beyond the 3-point line.
Brookin let it fly at 0:03.

”Charles [Smith] told me at the
bench that if I had the shot, to
take it,” he said. ’’I told coach
that I could make that shot dur-
ing the time-out.”

”We knew they'd be looking
for Curtis [Aiken], so I told Rod
to put it up,” said Smith. ”He
looked at me and said ‘You know
it.’ "

Just like old times — SWISH!

The second overtime was a
mismatch, as Pitt did pretty much
what it wanted. ”They wore us
down with their size,” said
O'Brien.

Credit the win, although it
wasn't a thing of beauty, to Evans,
Lane and Brookin. When the
game was tight, Evans masterful-
ly played the chess game. Lane
had the man at the ”Romes”

Boards office flipping ”Bs” all
night. And Brookin, with his
gamesaver, made it all
worthwhile.

wasn't the’ only competition the
Panthers encountered this past
’weekend. The majority of the
team competed at Edinboro
against Robert Morris, Carnegie
Mellon and host Edinboro. At this
meetthere was no scoring.

”There was no scoring to get
those who didn't compete else-
where a chance to run this
weekend,” Vasvary said.

Not trying to single anyone out,
Vasvary was especially pleased
with some of the younger
runners.

”There was a nice hurdles race

Vasvary. . «

All seven are hoping to qualify for

2:31 gone in the first period.

’’I was very excited tonight,”
said Santoro. ’’I had never seen
this guy before, so I didn't know
what to expect. I just went out
and exploded.”

Pitt's Gary Bolin took the next

‘match 22-7. This brought the

Panthers to within four points of
the lead. It was now time for the
Pitt fans to do some yelling, and
they did.

’’I felt really good tonight,” said
Bolin. ”This is the best match that
I have wrestled all year. I'm start-
ing to come to my peak now.”

The next match was key be-
cause a win could bring the Pan-
thers to within one point. Eric
Wertz fell behind early but was
only able to pull a‘tie at the end.
This made the score 18-14 and,
for the most part, sealed the Penn
State victory.

’’I wrestled his game,” said

‘Wertz. ”l misseda takedown ear-

ly and got frustated. We might

have lost, but l think Bill Lewis,"

‘Seeing, that the meet was
almost wrapped up; some fans
started to leave, and those that
did missed the most exciting
match of the evening;

It took place at the 177 divi-
sion. Another hometown boy,
Pitt's Bill Lewis, faced Wally
Voight of Penn State. Lewis
fought hard and strong but in the
end lost 7-4.

The final two matches were
split. At 190 pounds, Pitt's Mark
Stoner won 8-3. In the last match,
Panther heavyweight Chris Nuf-
her was pinned, making the final
score 32-17. ’ ‘

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

For most native northern col-
lege students, Florida is but a sun-

drenched Spring Break vision.

For one Pitt swimmer, though, it
is home.
Now in the midst of the grey

and cold of a Pittsburgh winter,
one has to be wondering why
anyone in their right mind would
leave the warmth of Florida for
the dreariness of the North dur-
ing winter. '

S Pitt freshman swimmer Charles
Fry, a native of St. Cloud, Fla., has
his reasons.

_ and countless other publications.

’’First I really wanted to attend

. a northern school,” said Fry. ’’I

needed a change from Florida.
The cold up here really doesn't
‘bother me. My, second reason for
coming north was Pitt's solid
swimming and academic pro-
gram. I am very pleased with the
decision I have made."

Pitt men's swimming coach
Fred Lewis discovered Fry at the
Junior National Championship
meet in Orlando, Fla., last year.

’’I thought he was extremely
talented,” said,Lewis. ”Pitt hasn't
been able to recruit kids with his

kind of talent lately. We got lucky
when we were able to bring him
up here to the snow.” -

Fry has made sizeable contri-
butions this year, holding team-
best times in the 1,650-, 1,000-
and 500-yard freestyles.

Fry is categorized as a distance
freestyler, although he has also
shown an aptitude for the short-
er events, swimming and placing
well in the 200-yard freestyle in
various meets this past season.

”The 500-yard freestyle is prob-
ably Fry's strongest event since it

Fry finds northern climate more suitable

longer races require and the
speed that the shorter races do,”
said Lewis. 

”We will really be counting on
our 500—yard freestyle swimmers,
especially Fry, to get our team off
to a good start at the Big East
[Championships] since it is the
first event,” continued Lewis.

Fry and Lewis are aiming high
for the future. Both feel that with
hard workyand dedication, Fry
will qualify for the NCAA Cham-
pionships next year and eventu-
ally for the Olympic trials.

. Fry holds mixed emotions
about the success he has ex-
perienced_in his first collegiate.
swimming season-

”ln some respects, l was sur-
prised by my success this year,”
said Fry. ’’I didn't expect to get

this far so fast.

Pitt hasn't been able
to recruit kids with
[Fry's] kind of talent
-lately. We got lucky
when we- were able to
bring him up here to

the snow.  
— Fred Lewis

”On the other hand, though, I
put in enough hard work to

. achieve my lifetime best times,” ,

continued Fry. ”You have to
work hard to achieve your goals.
The harder you work, the further
you can reach past your goals

. and the more you can achieve.”

Fry is favored to do well at the
Big East Chamionships this
weekend at Trees Pool. He is al-
ready 20 seconds under the
present Big-East record for the
1,650-yard freestyle.

Coach Lewis claims that part of
Fry's success was his ability to
blend in well with the Panther
team. Things wern’t always that

Surpsingly, at St. Cloud High
School, Fry was the only swim-

mer on the team for hisfirst three _

years.

Lack of teammates did not
hamper his swimming ability at
all, as he became a high school
All-American in the 500-yard
freestyle.

Fry has a bright future ahead of

him, provided he doesn't hurt _

himself first.

He has had a string of mishaps
in the past, including an arm
broken in four places while
rollerskating, 12 stitches for an
ankle cut while bicycling, and
eight stiches in the head after slip-
ping in the locker room last year
during Junior Nationals.

.When asked if he thought he
was clumsy, Fry replied, ”No, l’m
just a victim of circumstances.”

Fry hasn't had any mishaps this

year though, and he looks for- .

ward to good health and good
swims at the Big East Champion-
ships and the Eastern Seaboards.

’’I’m really excited about the
Big East Championships and the
Eastern Seaboards,” said Ery. ’’I

NFL instant replay rule
may be abolished

at owners’

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) —
A poll of the NFL’s 28 teams
shows instant replay may be dis-
continued in March when team
owners cast their votes over us-
ing the system next season, the
Fort Worth Star—Telegram report-

ed Sunday.

Four NFL clubs said they plan
to vote against it, and five others
said it will take a convincing
presentation by the league's com-
petition committee to keep them
from doing the same, the
newspaper reported.

Eight negative votes would
bring the league's one-year in-
stant replay experiment to an
end. '

The survey showed 10‘-teams
favored continuing the use of in-
stant replay, while 14 said they

were undecided, and four said

theyywill vote against it.

The‘ four teams that oppose
continuing the program are the
Cincinnati Bengals, Kansas City
Chiefs, New York Giants and St.
Louis Cardinals, the5tar—TeIegram
reported.

The five that are leaning toward
voting against instant replay are
the Minnesota Vikings, Pittsburgh
Steelers, Buffalo Bills, New En-
gland Patriots and Seattle
Seahawks.

request

”l’I| listen objectively. to any
discussion of it, but I think the
game should be left on the field,”
Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill said.
’’It doesn't matter if they change
or improve it.”

The competition committee,
chaired ‘by Dallas Cowboys’
president Tex Schramm, will
review the system and present its
findings at the league owners
meeting March 15-20 in Hawaii.

The experimental use of instant
replay was approved last year at
the owners meetingiby a 23-4
vote with one abstention.

Officials of some of the clubs
that voted in favor of the ex-

perimental system now say they -

are leaning toward getting rid of
it.

”We voted for it on a one-year
trial basis, but we've been vic-
timized by it,” said Minnesota
Vikings General Manager Mike
Lynn. ’’I would say we're leaning
against it.”

The 10 teams that said they will

vote for continued use of the in-
stant replay are the Indianapolis
Colts, San Diego Chargers, Atlan-
ta Falcons, Dallas Cowboys, Mi-
ami Dophins, Cleveland Browns,
Houston Oilers, Detroit Lions,
San Francisco 49ers and the
Washington Redskins, the Star-
Telegram reported.
