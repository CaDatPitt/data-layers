Not all of Congress favors
Clinton's health care plan

By Randy Knapiek '
Staff Writer 0 ’

Texas Senator Phil Gramm
opposes President Bill Clinton's

' health care plan for, a simple rea-

son: “it won’t work.”

Gramm and three other

Republican lawmakers spoke
Friday afternoon at Mercy

Hospital, stop 13 of a 19-city tour '

promoting a reformed private
_l_1_ealth care system and attacking
the presidents government-con-
trolled health care plan.

, Pennsylvania member of
Congress, Rick Santorum, said
Americans “don’t ‘need the gov-
ernment to take over one-sev-
enth of our economy in orderto

"-solve problems.” ,
“This decision will be the most

important made in this quarter
century,” said Georgia Senator
Paul Coverdell. ’

Gramm cited a lack of con-
crete evidence as a reason to be
skeptical about the governments
ability to manage health care bet-
ter ‘than a reformed private sys-
tem could. “I am convinced there

is no evidence that the govem— .

ment can run the health care sys-
tem more effectively.” he said.
Gramm said the main subject
of health care reform debate is
not how to provide coverage to

all Americans, but rather how to
control costs.

According to Gramm, only 19
pages of the president’s plan
deal with providing-unifonn cov-
erage, while the other 1,323
pages specify, how the govern-

ment would manage the system.
“If the debate is about helping

people geﬁ and keep good health

insurance, then there is plenty of

~ room for bipaitisanship. But if

the debate is about having the
government take over and run
our health care system you can
count me out,” he said.

Supporters and opponents of
the president’s plan do agree on
some points of health care
reform.

Gramm spoke of a “growing
consensus” in Congress to make
health care more affordable.

In addition, Gramm "said most
agree that health insurance
“ought to be more permanent,"
so that employees do not lose
their health insurance when "they

Five-year-old Davies
dies early T bursday

Laura Davies, who received a seven-organ transplant at
Children’s Hospital this year, died early Thursday morning in
the hospital at the age of five.

Dr. Andreas Tzakis, who performed the surgery, said at a

- press conference Thursday morning that “clearly, Laurais suf-
fering out-weighed any benefit from the second operation,”
according to the Pittsbmgb Post-Gazette.

When Daviesreceived her second transplant in September,
the procedure was considered a breakthrough by the opti-
mistic and condemned by the doubtful.

Tzakis said that “critics whosaid the operation would only
prolong the girl’s pain were proved correct,” according to the

When Davies was born, her intestines had formed on the
outside of her body, a condition called Gastroschesis.
Corrective surgery left her intestines too small to digest food
properly and she was placed on intra-venous feeding.

I Eventually, the tube feedings began to destroy her liver,
which couldn’t handle the high protein content of the IV
fluid, according to Children’s Hospital spokesperson

According to Baker, the effects of
massive unemployment in Detroit
had a worse effect on the city than
the steel industry lay offs had in
Pittsburgh.

“At least Pennsylvania still has a
General Assistance plan,” Baker
said. “The technology is here and
I’1u glad for it, but those who are
out of work are human beings and
they need necessities too.”

“We try to get the homeless into
vacant project housing,” Baker said.

SGB proposes way to increase revenue for safety/ transportation

By-A  Gresock
Staﬂ‘ Writer

In an effort to increase rev-
enue for campus safety and
transportation, Student
Government Board member Joe
Foner announced Friday that he
is investigating the ‘possibility of
having businesses and student
groups advertise on campus
huses. « - »

Foner said he has been

discussing the sale of adver— I

tisements to outside busines-
Pitt Assistant

Vice-Chancellor for Business
and Finance John DeVitto
and John Morgan of the
Department of Parking and
Transportation. , .

According to Foner, if
an agreement is made between
Lenzner, the owner of
the campus buses, and
SGB, businesses and student
organizations may be able
to purchase and display adver-
tisements similar to those
on Port Authority Transit
buses. 0

“This could be a big deal if

the contracts are alight,” Foner
‘said. “It could bring in as much
as $10,000 to $20,000.”

Foner said the money
received from the sales of ads

would be “earmarked” for spe- ,

cific transportation and safety
improvements, such as extend-
ing "A the on-call van’s service to
24 hours a day, further expand-
ing shuttle routes and possibly

‘extending hours at Hillman

Library. I

“The safe'ty“'problem isn’t
solved, but it’s, definitely taking
a step in the right direction,” he

said.

SGB President Jacob Brody
said the revenue from the ads
could also lower students’ safe-

.ty fees. “Eventually, the safety

fee can be phased out due to
the fact that the initial expendi-
tures [of the program] are fixed
costs.”

Foner also said that the
Computerized Survey Initiative
will begin a test run today in all
Pitt ‘computing labs. c

The survey consists of 12
yes/no questions. Foner said he
is working on “expanding it to

include direct questions or

short-answer [questions], but for I
now it will just be yes/no ques-

tions” ,

In other SGB business, Safety
Committee chair Derek Majikas
said he has discussed residence
hall security with Bob Hopkins
of the housing department in
light of the upcoming
Thanksgiving break. .

Majikas said Holland Hall, in
particular, “has been marredby

Pitt unites with other
universities Via satellite

to discuss campus unity

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

“We Can Get Along : A Blueprint for Campus Unity” was
broadcast live via satellite Wednesday in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

The broadcast, sponsored by the Division of Student

Society, presented a panel discussion with university faculty
and administators from across the nation. _

“I think everyone is responsible for -campus unity. But any-
one who doesn’t take part will miss out on a lot,” said Paul
Shang, director _of Help for Education and Life Planning
Success Center, Colorado State University. '

The panel focused on issues such as discrimination, affir-
mative action and the benefits of student organizations.

One aspect of discrimination that the panel members said
they felt strongly about was the issue of free speech. ’

“A lot of people don’t understand that your free speech
stops when it infringes on mine,” race relations counselor at
the University of Texas Curtis Polk said. A

Shang stressed that he felt “it is important that when we
talk about freedom of speech we understand what we are
‘talking about. Racial epitaphs are not freedom of speech.”

Expo to aid students

By Brian Whitley  
For The Pitt News

The William Pitt Union
became a bridge to the working
world Thursday when over
300 companies from the
Pittsburgh area set up tables
in the Assembly Room to
show Pitt’s minority community
what employers are looking
for. _ N _

The 1993 African-American
Job Expo coordinated by- The
Black Action Society and The

_National Society of.lBlack

Engineers was a featured part of
Black Week. Since 1985, BAS
and NSBE has brought compa-

nies and the minority communi-

ty of Pitt together.

According to the 1993 Job
Expo Student Guide Book,
the primary goal was to give
the students the opportunity
to display their knowledge
and their qualifications and to
make possible contacts for
employment. The secondary

goal was to let the companies

present themselves to the stu-

dents and invite them to join
their firms. _

Coordinators Erika
Drummond of NSBE, Will
Thomas of NSBE and Andre
Nelson of BAS said they were
pleased with the tumout.

“I was very happy with the
outcome,” Drummond said.

.“We started planning for this
‘event in late April. With the

combined efforts of BAS-and
NSBE; the event turned out to
be above expectations.”

Students from Pitt as well as
all local colleges attended the
Expo.

“I felt that the Job Expo was
very beneficial,” said Tamara
Watkins, a Chatham College
student.

“I’m only a junior; this pro-
vides me with some exposure
to some companies that I may
not have been exposed to.”

Faculty and administrators on
the panel said afﬁrmative action
needed to involve all students
and faculty. “I think people
don’t get involved when they
think they don’t have a stake.
All people need to realize it
affects them,” Polk said. 0

Gloria Romero, professor of
Chicano Studies at Loyola
Marymount University, said, “I
think affirmative action needs to
be at all levels. If it starts with
students only, it’s not going to
work.” Members of the panel

— said that campus organizations

were crucial in creating campus
unity. ‘

“It’s a natural need for young
people to get together on mat-
ters of common interest, and I
think it’s very important for_uni—
versities ‘ to allow that,”
Professor of Psychology at
Barnard College Jaqueline
Fleming said.‘

However Romero said she
believed that organizations
alone could not create unity
between students. ‘

“I think student organizations
need to coalesce — they need
to work together,” she said.

Majikas said during
Thanksgiving break, housing
staff members will check
to make sure second-
ﬂoor windows and all doors
are locked. He also said

A students should be responsi-

ble when signing in their
guests.

Student Dina Scardamalia
also encouraged Holland’s
residents to keep security in
mind when they leave for
Thanksgiving. ~

“I’d like to urge all students
of Holland Hall, especially
those on the second floor
where most break-ins
come from, to leave their win-
dows locked,” Scardamalia

said. “It .would help tremen-
dously with the security
issue.” .

The board also discussed
the possibility of requiring
SGB president and/or at least
one board member to be in
the SGB office during all reg-
ular business hours.

“There has been a lot
of concern about the acces-
sibility of the board,” Board
member Ted Schroeder
said.

“A lot of times students
come up to the office and ask
to see a board member  and
there’s no one here to see
them.” ,

Schroeder said all board
members are required by SGB
by-laws to keep at least ten
office hours each week, and
the president must keep 12

office hours, but their hours
often overlap.

“It would make sense that
office hours were organized
so there was always one

member in the office,” he .

said.

“The total of 92 hours
required for the president and
the board should easily cover
the 40-hour week.”

Davies

, Continued from page I
In June of 1992, Davies received a new liver and small
intestines. After several episodes of organ rejection, her
intestines were damaged. In the following March, she had

her spleen removed, according to the Post—Gazette.

She then received a second transplant by Tzakis. The
transplant included two kidneys, small and large intestines,
a liver, stomach and pancreas.

Two weeks ago, she developed Lympho-Proliferative
Disease which was caused by a complication from the
irnmunosuppressive drug, FK-506, given to Davies to pro-
tect her body from organ rejection, according to the Post-
Gazette.

“The. window between rejection and Lympho-
Proliferative Disease was too narrow,” Tzakis said in the
P0st—Gazette.As Davies’ condition worsened, she suffered a
neurological trauma similar to a stroke, which left her brain
damaged. At that point, her parents, Les and Fran Davies,
decided to have the respirator she was placed on turned
off, according to LeMasters.

There have been five children who have received multi-
visceral transplants using this drug. Three of these children
have survived.

change jobs. _
“When somebody changes

' jobs in America, more often they

change health insurance,”
Gramm said. If health insurance
policies did not expire when a
person. changed jobs, however,
these “temporarily uninsured,”

which account for 85 percent of-

the United States’ 57 million
uninsured, would retain cover-
age even when between jobs.

Most lawmakers also agree
that health insurance should not
be cancelled simply because the
purchaser becomes stricken with
a major health ailment.

“We need to insure that when
people buy health insurance 
as long as they pay the premium,
no matter what happens to them
in temis of getting sick, that their
insurance cannot be cancelled,”
Gramm said. Most uninsured
Americans do not fall under the
governments deﬁnition of poor,
because Americans with incomes
below the poverty line are cov-
ered by Medicaid, he said;

Those who are uninsured eam
incomes over the poverty line,
but cannot afford to purchase
insurance, he said. “Something is
wrong in America when people
who don’t work have good
health insurance coverage and
people who do work and make
moderate incomes don’t have
any coverage.”

‘‘I don’t understand a society
which treats people who are rid-
ing in the wagon better than
those who are pulling the
wagon,” Gramm said.

Gramm also said the
Republican health care plan

would provide a, “sliding—scale— T

tax credit” for those who earn
moderate incomes, to make

health insurance affordable.

Another option employees
have under the Republican plan
is to purchase a “medical IRA,”
Gramm said.

With this option, an employee
pays an annual deductible less
than those of existing health
insurance plans and deposits

additional money into this “med-

ical savings account.”

If the employee does not
exhaust this account during the
year, because of a major illness
for instance, the employee takes
the remainder of the account as
take-home pay. 0

According to Gramm, one of
the reasons health care costs rise
so quickly is because consumers
pay very little of the cost directly
out of their pockets. About 95
percent of the cost is covered by
“third parties,” such as health
insurance companies, he said.

Because the public has to

absorb so little of the cost,’

Gramm said the health care sys-
tem often “provides quality we
can’t afford.” _

“IfI bought groceries like I buy

health care, I would eat different-
ly and so would my dog,” he
said. The “fundamental disagree-
ment” many legislators have with
the president’s plan is how to
control this unaffordable cost.

Gramm said that under the
president’s plan, selling a health
care plan in competition with the
goverrmienfs would “That’s
confidence in the product you’re
selling,” he said.

According to Gramm, Clinton
has given “no theoretical under-
pinnings whatsoever to the asser-
tion that goverrmient, as the only
buyer of health care, can buy

health care cheaper.” R

Gramm said the “good, honest,
dedicated bureaucrats” who
would run the health care system
under the Clinton plan have no
incentive to control costs.

“We are likely to end up with
all of the compassion of the IRS
and all the efficiency of the post
office,” he said.

Arizona Senator John McCain

the president’s plan in recent‘

weeks indicates “the American

Coverdell said “no matter what

plan will “produce massive frus-

“It took us half a century to get

Based on platforms and personal interviews with each
Student Government Board board candidate, The Pitt
News feels the following people are those qualified to
serve as elected student ofﬁcials.

Heath Golden. Golden has definite ideas to improve
the safety of Pitt’s campus. Reinstating Crime Stop,
forming a town watch and ‘inviting campus police into
Freshman Studies classes are all steps that could realisti-
cally help address the safety problems on campus.
Although safety may seem to be overplayed, Golden
has done his homework and knows what is feasible.

Elizabeth Mania. Mania, along with her slate mate
Golden, has done her research as well. Her plan to
form a Representative Student Council is a step towards
the democracy SGB is supposed to be. She plans to -ini-
tiate an SGB newsletter/update which would fill stu-

l dents in on what their elected officials have been doing

and how students could get involved with SGB. Her
plans are well thought out and provide much needed
services for students. ~

Eric McKinley. McKinley’s plans to increase student
involvement are practical and feasible. He has shown
-Hirnself to be knowledgeable of issues facing groups on
campus that tend to be overlooked by many. It is time
someone from SGB addressed Pitt’s low minority reten-
tion rate and united with the Black Action Society to do
something about it. By uniting forces, much more can
be accomplished. * « ’

Andrew Wuertele. Wuertele also has delved into the
university system and checked out the feasibility of his
plans. His plans to increase student office space and to

u add academic minors in nursing, pharmacy  engi-
} neering would benefit students. Although a lot of _red
f tape will be involved in both of Wueitele’s projects, he

has shown he understands the obstacles and still is will-
ing to stick with the projects.
‘ Chris Fedeli.‘ Fedeli’s pla-n to form a student—run-

. course evaluation guide is something that needs to be

done for this campus. He has called other universities
and looked into forming a guide detailing how students
feel about courses on the Pitt campus. His current posi-
tion as Academic Affairs Chair gives him the experience
to complete such a project.

.Jason McCright. McCrigh.t says his focus will be on the .

cost of education and how to help students deal with

rising costs, a concern to the majority of students. He

«has» also looked into expansion of the shuttle system
and how to alleviate the crowding on the Squirrel
Hill/Shadyside routes. Both are projects that would help
students and which McCright seems to have researched.

Although the Student Government Board is comprised
of eight board members and students are only able to
place five votes, we feel any combination of these can-

" ididates would be the rightchoice. Hopefully students? .

will review the issues and vote responsibly.

It’s tough being a guy these
days. The 90’s have proven to
be very confusing. Some peo-
ple say we’re rapacious and
untrustworthy (“put away that
nudie book!”). Others argue
the opposite,that men have
become too timid (“would you
quit apologizing?!?”).
Everywhere you see book and
pamphlets telling you what’s
what. The solutions offered to
the male species’ dilemma
range from abasing itself for its
testosterone—induced sins to
beating drums and weeping in
the woods with a bunch of
other hairy, stinky males.

As amusing as these propos-
als may be, they don’t suggest
much in the way of a practical
roadmap to life. The recent
proliferation of “solutions” to
our “problems” has only served
to reduce public discourse
about the male and his place in
society to a whirling maelstrom
of half-baked ideas. Who suf-
fers as a result of this degener-
ation? We're the ones who
wind up getting it! The time
has come for us to take action.
Instead of whining about a lack
of direction, we must sort this
mess out ourselves.

“But Shawn, where do we
start?” you ask. The answer, my
brothers, is surprisingly simple.
If we want to find our way

' through this dark wilderness of

confusion, we must think our
way through it. If you think I’m
joking, ask yourselves the R51-
lowing questions: How did
Portugal achieve so much eco-
nomic success in the late 15th
and early 16th centuries?; Why
is ancient Greek philosophy
still so inﬂuential?

So, what’s the answer to
these questions? The
Portuguese founded a school
devoted to the art of explo-
ration by sea. Certain Greeks
(e.g. Plato) founded an acade-
my devoted to the study of
philosophy. Simply put, each

’ group thought its way through

its problems. If they can do it,
then so can we!
What is needed here is a

 

eing a man in the '90s

consistent, disciplined
approach to the study of man-
liness. In order to reach this
goal, I offer a humble sugges-
tion. It’s time that we had a
men’s cultural center here at
Pitt. P

- The center would allow us
to explore the vexing issues
that have troubled us men
since time immemorial. “Is it

Shawn
McClearn

true that nice guys finish last?”
“What’s to be gained by bond-
ing with my fellow man?” “Why
do we love to scratch our-
selves?” All of these questions
and _ many more could be
explored with the depth and
intensity that they deserve -— if
we had a cultural center.. The
most pressing issue the center
would examine is the nature of
that which has come to be
known as “macho”. In order

- for us to understand ourselves

better, we must understand this
integral part of our being.
Thus, the center’s first task will
be to find a concrete definition
of macho.
. Allow me to tell you what
macho means to me. (If you
disagree, then all the better.
That’s why we’re here.) Macho
is a mix .of stoicism, rugged
individualism, and blunt hon-
esty. Truly macho guys don't
whine about their problems;
they deal with them. They are
too honest to disguise their
opinions and do not apologize
for givingunpopular and con-
troversia1.opinions.Most impor-
tantly, macho men do not
think; they act. The Hamlet bit
just doesn’t cut it for them.. (I
don’t consider myself to be
macho. If I were, I wouldn’t be
here writing, I would be some-
where else getting ready for
deer season.)

Perhaps I’m getting ahead of
myself. Although there may not

be a working definition for
macho, there is enough of a
consensus to construct a basic
canon. The following list may
be sketchy, but it makes for a
good start.

Historical Macho:

Alexander the Great

Julius Caesar

Caesar Augustus

Hannibal

Attila the Hun

Ivan the Terrible

William the Conquerer

' Henry II of England

Cosimo de Medici

General George Sherman

Sir Richard Burton (the explor-
er, not the actor)

Geronimo

20th Century Macho: ,

Chuck Yeager

John Wayne

General George S. Patton
Mickey Spillane

The “Steel Curtain” defense
(especially Jack Lambert and
“Mean” Joe Greene)

Humphrey Bogart

Faux Macho:

Arnold Schwarzenegger
(steroids and an accent do not
macho make)

Ernest Hemingway (real men
don’t blow their heads off)
Lyndon Johnson (LBJ was an

S.O.B., not macho; there is a ~

difference)
Finally, the MCC will have two
patron saints of macho:
Ghengis Kahn (kicked more
butt than anyone else in all of
history)
And the MCC’s living patron
saint:
Sean Connery (if you have to
ask..., plus, he’s Scottish!)

Brothers, the time has come
for us to stand up and proclaim
our love for ourselves. Armed
with the power of knowledge,
we must march forward and
claim our rightful place in soci-
ety. The men’s cultural center
is the first step toward our
place in the sun. Let the world
tremble before us as we
advance and cry out, “I am
man! Hear me belch!”

Sporadic Pitt volleyball goes onefo (1

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staﬂ‘ Writer

The Pitt volleyball team t20—9) was at its
schizophrenic best and‘ worst this weekend,
beating the 19-12 Louisville Cardinals in four
games Friday night and losing badly to 17th-
1-a-nked Notre Dame yesterday.

Senior outside hitter Ann Marie Lucanie was
in the middle of plays that exemplified both
matches. ‘ - A . .,

When Pitt struggled to finish off game three
against Louisville, Lucanie slammed the‘ game-
winning kill down the sideline. Pitt made the
clutch plays to beat the Cardinals.

Against Notre Dame, Lucanie dove to dig a
ball. An errant second hit sent the ball back in
her direction. Nobody covered up, and Lucanie
wasleft trying to hit a ball from her knees with
her back to the net. Like the entire match, it
wasn’t even close. A _ -

“I don’t know what our team is going to do,
because we’re always up and down,” Lucanie
said. “I’d like to think that we had come back
and established a consistent level, but today 
How do you go out and play Louisville [that
well] and then play Notre Dame like this?”

Pitt had struggled to beat a good team all year
and finally did against the Cardinals. ‘

“Pitt volleyball did something tonight we
have not done all year,” Pitt Head Coach Cindy
Braziel said Friday night._“T hat is [to] play a
team that is comparable in a_thleticism, that is
viewed comparably nationally [and win]... it

was a gutcheck. Before tonight, we lost the gut
checks.” ’

g The Panthers controlled game one with to a
15-7 win, but blew an 8-4 lead by losinglthe
second game 15-12. a

In game three, Pitt charged out quickly again,
taking an 11-3 lead when Jennie Driscoll tipped
a ball, into an open space. The Cardinals rallied,
turning Pitt’s 11-5 bulge into a 14-15 margin on
a kill by L0uisville’s Becky Verst.

“That’s a horrible feeling,”. Braziel said. “We
make a couple of bad plays. They make a cou-
ple of great plays. Then we back off.... We
allow them to emotionally dominate us.”

A kill by Sarah Mitchell gave Pitt another
game point, then Lucanie sealed the deal with a
shot down the line. 5 ‘

“[Lucanie] had an all-or-nothing match. There
were times she didn’t make the right decisions,”

Braziel said. “When it was clutch  she's got

the athleticism and the mentality to be success-
ful. » 2
“Everybody made the plays so we were in a

positionfor Am [Lucanie] to get the final kill.’

She’s our go-to kid and we went to her.”

Game four was a 46 minute battle with seven
ties. The teams played even up to 13-13, then
Carrie T homton made two key plays — a kill to

get Pitt the side out and a service ace for the 14-

13 lead. Driscoll found an open back court for
the ﬁnal-point.
Friday night, Braziel said she expected the
team to be loose for the match against Notre

In her remarkable best-selling novel
The Fountainhead, Ayn Rand champions
a philosophy of rational egoism.

This revolutionary philosophy holds that
reason is each man's only proper guide for
action, and his only proper goal should be

his own personal happiness.

Dr. Bernstein, Associate Professor of
Philosophy at Pace University, will discuss
how The Fountainhead—with its theme of

independence in thought and action-

concretizes and dramatizes Objectivism,
Any Rand's philosophy of rational egoism.

College took a 7-0-1 record and
a national ranking into the
Notre Dame Stadium and came
home embarrassed, 54-7.

“It will definitely be a pride
game,” Eagle running back
Darnell Campbell said. “We will

 

have to play for ourselves and
not care what the country thinks
about Boston College.”

The country, however, must
think highly of Campbell. _

The leading touchdown scor-
er in the nation with 19,
Campbell had another excellent
game against Pitt. Rushing for
89 yards on 13 carries and
catching three passes for 69
yards, Campbell is a true dou-

ith Pitt pasting

ble—threat to opposing teams.
“If somebody told me that

Damell Campbell was going to _

be the leading touchdown scor-
er in the nation before the sea-
son began, I would have said
they were lying,” Campbell said.

But Campbell is no joke.
Against Pitt, Campbell naturally
found the end zone again.

hurt ourselves  To come out

~ with no points"—‘ it really got

everybody depressed,” Pitt
quarterback ]ohnRyan said. '-
Pitt’_s defense did put a hood

_over the Eagles’ eyes. in the-sec-

ond quarter, apparently holding
Boston College scoreless when
Eagle’ place kicker David
Gordon missed a 31-yard field
goal to end the half. But an oil‘-

sides penalty against Pitt gave
Gordon another try. This time
the kick was good to give
Boston College a 16-0 lead at
halftime. T . , . v -
The Panthers, who have
played well in the second half
of several games this year, were
unable to light off the second-
half attack by the Eagles, and
lethargically wentthrough the
motions for two more .qua”r.ters.

 
   

COUNCIL THRIFT sHoP  
    3512mm AVE.

 

“The second half was a total
disaster offensively,” Majors
said.

One of the only positive notes

seen by Pitt fans’ in the second

2 half was a lull in the steady rain-

fall. Everything else remained

status quo for both teams, as the
Eagles soared for seventeen

. more pointswhile completely

holding back‘ the Panthersfor

_ the 33-0 win.

Boston College quarterback
Glenn Foley completed 22 of 57

passes for a total of 560 yards

and three touchdowns. Foley’s

most productive target was “split

end Clarence Cannon, who
caught three passes for 115

yards, including a long catch of
75 yards. Eagles’ tight end Pete
Mitchell was not quite as pro-
ductive, but caught seven pass-
es for 110.yard's and a touch-
down. ’ P

The Boston College ground
attack was led by Darnell
Campbell, who ran for 89 yards
with 158.al1-purpose yards and

_two touchdowns.

“We were beaten by a very
good, explosive, exciting, out-
standing and far superior foot-
ball team today," Majors said.
"One of our biggest disappoint-
ments was giving up the big
plays. I wouldn’t want to elabo-
rate at this point."

Dame.

“We have nothing to lose,”
Braziel said. “There is no fear in
a match like that. We’re sup-
posed to lose to them '—— on
paper.”

They did that on paper and
everywhere else.

Mitchell had nine -hitting
errors in the match (the team
had 29). The entire Notre Dame
team combined for nine errors.
The Panthers attacked at a .096
clip, far below their .249 season
‘average. Notre Dame pounded
out an astounding .449 percent-
age‘. .

“They just didn’t make any
errors,”— Pitt: assistant coach
Brian -Begor said. “If you don’t

play well against a team that

doesn’t make errors, you’re
going to get crushed, and we
did. I think they sensed that we
were not playing well. All they
were doing was keeping the
ball in play. They knew sooner
or later we’d self-destruct.”

The Irish dominated the first
two games 15-2, 15-1.’ The
Panthers kept game three close
for a while before losing 15-8.

“If we’d have started game
one like we staited game three,
it would have been very com-
petitive. But once you get
thumped like that  it’s dis-
couraging as hell,” Begor said.

Begor said the weekend was

a positive because of the
Louisville game. He and Braziel
tried to turn the team’s focus to
next weekend’s Big East
Tournament, telling the players
to put the loss behind them.
A “No, I can’t [forget it],”
Lucanie said. “Maybe some of
the others can, but I can’t. I
don’t accept losses like that.”

B.C.

Continued from page 9 .
Campbell scored the Eagles’
second TD on a four-yard run.
He returned to paydirt in the
second half with a little catch-
and-run.

“That was one of the nice
plays,” Foley said of Campbel1’s
61-yard screen pass hook-up. “I
like togthrow three-yard passes
and have my receivers run 60
yards for the score.”

.\Y/hile Campbell and Foley
were having a field day, Eagle
cornerback“Michael Reed was
just taking care of business.

Posting a shutout, Reed
stopped a Pitt drive early in the
game with his second intercep-
tion of the year. Reed, like the
rest of the B.C. defense, was not
overlooking Pitt.

“Just look at the Northwestern
game for example,” Reed said.
“A lot of people were not
focused for that game and it
showed.”

But that .does not mean
Boston College was not looking
for a little payback next week.

“If anybody was with us last
year, they know we got our
butts kicked [against Notre
Dame],’’ Reed said. “It’s a pride
game.”

That was the feeling outside
the Eagle locker room — a
clear-cut, focused, suit-and-tied
experience. ‘
