Seminar Held For Media Appearance

Yesterday’s seminar for suc-
cessful public media appearances
took an ironic twist when KDKA
radio talk show host Roy Fox
suggested that the media itself hold
the seminar.

“I would suggest a seminar for
news leaders similar to the one
we’re having today,” Fox said.
“They could sit down and discuss
what constitutes news and whtatls
sensationalism.”

Speaking on “The Art and
Hazard of Appearing in Pubic
Media” were Roy Fox, KDKA radio
talk show host; Robert S. Perkins,
Media Training Consultant for
Bob Perkins and Co.; and
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar.

A Perkins, a former anchorman
for KDKA television news,
‘stressed organization and research
as being necessary for an effective
interview.

“Most of the time when you have
a media opportunity, . . . you sayl
can't tell my story in 30 or 45
seconds. If you’re organized, you
can do it,” Perkins said.

An example of helpful research,
which Perkins also refers to as
“homework and preparation,”
would be to become familiar with
the person who is interviewing
you. Finding out something about
them will give the person being
interviewed some“ idea of what to

’expect.

In the “old days,” and even
today, interviewers intimidated
their subjects by - using what
Perkins calls “dirty tricks.”

One technique is to “stand right
up against them,” making a person
feel uncomfortable’, with this
sudden intimacy. Perkins’ solution
is to “just step back.”

Another method is the “ice
cream cone mike,” with the
microphone passing between the
two for “I take a lick, you take a
lick, I take a lick.” '

Not removing the mike after an

interviewee had finished what he.

had to ‘say is also a
technique.
In defense of the media, Perkins
said that now radio and television
stations “d_o everything they can"
to make you look good and make
the show as successful as possible.
“Especially T.V.h,” Perkins added.
“They knock themselves out to
make you feel comfortable.”

rattling

Roy Fox emphasized audiences

importance in relation to the

media. “A good writer or educator

needs a good audience,” he said.
Reading is an ‘‘imperative’’ need

for full audience understanding of ,

what is happening in the news.
“A one half hour television

newscast equals about one page of

print in" a newspaper." Fox added

/

that “we’re becoming a culture of
contraptions” that relies totally on
television for knowledge. The
audience must ‘also do its own
work; a concept he utilizes in his
radio talk show.

Salvador become
another Vietnam? On Tuesday
evening, rng_re than 300 people left
Clapp Hall Auditorium sensing

that U.S. involvement ‘in El
Salvador could escalate into‘
another Vietnam war.‘

That night, the film “El

Salvador: Another Vietnam”, an
academy award nominee for best
documentary, was shown to a
packed house in the Clapph Hall
_ Auditorium. A spokesman for the

Democratic Revolutionary Front ,

(FDR), the popular resistance
movement in El Salvador, was on
hand to make a brief statement and
answer -questions I from the
audience. His message
translated by an interpreter and
V relayed to‘ the audience. The event
was sponsored by the‘ Progressive
Student Network and the Central
American Mobilization Coalition.
The film was verypowerful and
‘relayed the suffering of the
Salvadoran people. Instead of

showing endless photos of shacks.

and honey torsos, “El Salvador:
Another Vietnam” offered short
explanations of the coffee and
cottoneconomies, the rise and fall
of several military-civilian juntas
and the regime’s 1980. agarian
reforms.

The film also touched on news
stories like the 1980 murders of the

Maryknoll_ ‘ "missionaries and -
Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar
. Romero-—events that many

viewers may no longer remember
or link with El Salvador.
The agarian reform policy was

. singled out as “a pretext for
terrorizing the countryside” and“

was _

. who

equated with what “U.S. adivisers
in Vietnam called pacification.”
The filmmakers interviewed
peasants in refugee camps, telling
how their relatives were killed and
their villages destroyed by soldiers.
In one segment of the film,
.Duarte, the current. junta
president, admits “a lot" of
peasants are dying in El Salvador
but points out that most
Salvadorans are peasants, whether
friends or foes. “Who wants
violence?” he asks. Not the
government, not the army, not the
people, he says; instead it's the
enemies of all three. Duarte smiles
and declares there is repression in
the country.

The film used
delivered by Duarte, President
Reagan, Alexander Haig and the
State Department’s John Bushnell
to convince the viewer of the U.S.
bungling in El Salvador and the

Wparallels of U.S. administrative

On -hand to answer questions.
pertaining to El Salvador was
Alfredo Monge, a member "of the
FDR. Monge was a member of the
first military-civilian junta in
1979, but he resigned and was
forced into exile after attempts
were made on his life by right-wing
death sauads.

Monge stated that he is a member

of these groups merged in 1980 to
form a broad coalition of the
Salvadoran people. Monge said the
FDR has a wide range of members
which include “trade unioni_sts,
small businessmen, church
groups, different political parties,

. students and many professionals."

Monge made a brief statement to
the audience. He thanked them for
inviting him to come and speak
and for all the support that the
American people have given to his
people. He ‘warned of the dangers
of the possibility of U.S. troops
being sent to his country, and he
urged all those in the audience to
prevent this before it becomes a
reality.

He summarized the current
situation in El Salvador: “First,

you have the advancement of the

military struggle among the
people in all parts of the country."
Mohge added that the resistance is
growing among all sectors of the
population and their control of
more territories.

“Second, you see the ‘-failure of
the landreform program,” Monge
said. The “land reform program
didn't work and is now being used
as the justification for massacres.

' “Third, you have the
recognition of the FDR-FMLN, by
the. French and Mexican govern-
ments and other international
political bodies, as the sole
representative of the Salvadoran
people..This is a direct blow to the
U.S. government; that is why they
have stepped,‘ up the military
repression in my country,” Monge
said. A

Monge added that the upcoming

elections on March 28 are
insignificant . and will only
prolong the suffering of the

»Salvadoran people. He said that

the only candidates in the elections
are right-wing extremists and that
Duarte and the Christian Demo-
crats have lost all popular support
since aligning with the military
junta. V‘ i
“The elections are a farce,”
Monge said. “The only supporter‘

of the elections is the U.S. The only ‘

thing that will come out of these

elections is that the extermination

of my people will be legitimized by

the U.S.”.

Mon ge added that the students of
Salvador are playing

important role in fighting th

El

repression in El Salvador. He noted .

that the university of El Salvador
has now been closed for two years
and that many students are not
being permitted to continue. their
education.

Monge referred to a scene in the
film that showed how the National
Guard made an assault on the
university in 1980 and slaughtered
200 students. He compared this to
the U.S. National ’Guard's
handling of the Kent State student
uprising, as he grimly described
the massacre. .

While addressing the -many 

students in the auditorium,Monge
said, “The people of my country
want to live in peace with the U.S.
We pose no threat to the U.S.’s
security; My . people
negotiated settlement and friendly
relationships with all countries.”

Monge closed by say-ing,“Those

Interviewing Examined

identified several levels of media
coverage.

‘ There's the “classical hometown
syndrome" inswhich we negatively
criticize ourselves. “Who writes a

superlative criticism?" Posvar
asked. '

Closely related to this is‘ th€
“Pittsburgh apology syndrome."
With the fourth best, ranking
nationally as a preferred place to
live, Posvar believed that therewas
“no need to apologize.” ,

There are psychological
phenomena, such as a headline’s
differing from the crux of an article

for the sake of attracting reader.

attention.

In television reporting, there’s
“interview shock” with “Mike
Wallace style guestions” being
asked. No’ advanced warning is
given to the interviewee as to what
questions will be asked or with
what evidence_ the reporter may
suddenly confront the person.

To better deal with the media,
Posvar suggested that interviewees

deal with the media.

“In this game there’s always ’a

dark humor,” Posvar said.

When being interviewed for
television, “encapsulate your
comments,”ahe said. About twenty
seconds is recommended. a

Posvar - also suggested that
keepingit “spare andlean,” or in

, other words, “simple and stupid.”

- When speaking to printed media
representatives, Posvar ‘suggested
that “if you don’t want it printed,
don’t say it,”and to be “careful of
context” while speaking.

You must also be willing to take
your lumps and accept _unjust
criticism. “Turn the other cheek,"
he said. ' '

  Are Campuses More Conservative?

A study done for the Ameri-
can Council on Education
showed that 24 percent of this
year's college freshmen con-
sider themselves politically
conservative as opposed to 15
percent in l97l. ’

The number of freshmen cal-

-- ling themselves liberal dropped

sharply from 38 percent in 1971.
to 18 percent last fall, according

 to the study.

-Might this be a trend-—and if
so—-is it here to stay? Are stu-
dents at college campuses

becoming more politically con-_

servative in their views? What
effects will Reagan's economic
policies have ‘upon students’
political thinking?

Forum sought opinions from
Joe Aloe—president of Pitt's
chapter of College Republi-

cans, and Ann Leopold——

organizer of Eitt’s chapter of
Americans for Democratic
Action (ADA_).

Joe Aloe

President, Pitt
Chapter College
Republicans

According to Aloe, college
students are becoming. more
politically conservative in that
they don't believe in past eco-
nomic policies “where the fed-
eral‘government engaged in
excessive spending."

“Students realize to get the
economy back on its feet into a
healthy, prosperous state, the
federal government must
tighten its belts; they must
spend less,” he said.

“While students are in
school, they may show a nega-

tive feeling toward Reaganom-
ics, but if the administration's
economic policies help the
country, students will realize
that eventually they will be for
the benefit of everyone-—
including themselves."

Aloe‘ said college campuses
are not an ideal environment
for “the conservative move-
ment” though students are
“more conservativenow than in

.the past."

“I'm talking about my expe-
riences at Pitt; other campuses I
am unsure about," he said.
“But I do believe conservatism
is stronger now among the pub-
he as the recent Republican
gains in House and Senate seats
expresses. The ' country_ as a
whole has made a powerful
swing to the right and I think it
will stay this way in the future.”

Ann Leopold
Organizer, Youth

Caucus Chapter of the

Americans For
Democratic Action

Agreeing with Aloe in that a’

politically conservative trend
has emerged at campuses, Leo-
pold warned that with Reagan
administration’s proposed
financial aid cutbacks to stu-
dents “a latent liberalism may
be surfacing due to present
conditions.”

Leopold said she is not so
sure the so-called New Right is
a powerful trend in that “they
do not represent the interests of
the ‘public’ " though they are
“politically stronger” as evi-
denced by a Republican major-
ity in the Senate.

Support the

“It may appear I am a
member of a minority group
(liberals), but I am not. -Right
now the New Right, which’*is_
destroying many of our coun-
try’s traditional values, is effec-
tive because it’s highly
organized," she said. “The
ADA group is busy recruiting
candidates, undertaking diverse
projects, writing letters and lob-
bying to educate students as to

. what is happening with the

New Right.”

Leopold warned that because
of deep cuts in governmental
programs——not just the axing
of financial aid—students

“must change their political,

thinking and do something
about it; students must get

organized effectively before it’s,

too late.f' _

Misconceptions: A Block To  
Third World Relationships

_ ‘By JEFF RUSSELL

Foreign aid to the nations of the
Third World from the powerful
countries of the Industrialized
World might not bekhelping the
relationship between‘ these two
groups because of misperceptions
they hold about _each other,
according to Doctor Jerome Wells,
an associate professor in Pitt's
department of economics.

. Wells, speaking at the Noontirne
Lecture Series sponsored by the
Student Cabinet of the University

.Honors Program and the Academ-

ic Affairs Committee of the Student
Government, ‘ cited two main
problems that have developed in
the relationship. ’

One problem, Wells said, is that,
on the part of, both sides “there is
an attempt to shift the blame”
away from themselves. Each side
blames the other for mishandling
its role in the economic aid

0 programs. ,

The second problem is that
)“harde_ning__of positions on both

sides has undercut communica-
tions between them.” .

Wells, explaining the history of
foreign aid, said that belief in the
beneficial aspects of foreign aid
didn’t occur until after World War
Two. , ‘ .

Before World ~War
economies of the “South,” as the
Third World is often referred to
today, were termed “backward.” By
1950, however, they began to be
called “underdeveloped” instead.
Now, they are even more politely
referred to as “developing.’.’

Wells said that under President

Truman “The notion that you -

could successfully plan economies
came to be-.. accepted.” This
acceptance’ was brought about by
the success of the Marshall Plan (to
rebuild West Germany and
Western Europe) and by the success
of aid programs to Greece (to
prevent Communist, uprisings).
These successes led us to embark
upon a policy of supporting

' developing nations’ economies.
During the ’50s, there still was '

some debate /over the costsand the

Two,

benefits of foreign economic aid,
but the debate ended with the
election of President Kennedy in
1960. Kennedy was a strong
supporter of foreign aid programs.

“The 1960s was a period..of
economic aid optimism,” Wells
said. The beliefs then were that
“interventionist policy would be
beneficial policy” and that the
policy “leads to self-sustained
economic growth,”

These beliefs began to ‘change
around 1970. This change was due
to two reasons; the failure of aid
programs in Vietnam to prevent
insurrection, and the high infla-
tion blamed in part on expensive
foreign aid programs, according to
Wells. _ .

“A breakdown of consensus
came about during the Seventies,”
Wells said. This breakdown,
coupled with a new skepticism of

" aid policy, caused a decrease in aid

to the Third World countries.
This, in turn, caused the Third
World “to go on its own line."
Wells said that the developing
countries are growing as fast as the

I

I ,5

~ a

'TheiPitit 1~‘t‘e..;;.;' iriliiil-..t'y', March E6, 1982 A

-4

industrial powers did during the
Industrial Revolution.

’ If economic aid policy appears to
be working, then is there
disillusionment and debate?

Wells cited several reasons. First,
for the developing nations, “dis-
illusionment occurs because of the
strainsof growth.” Second , the

influx of people into urban areas i

(away from farms), xleads to a
number, of problems.

This influx is a partial cause of
the third problem, agricultural
failure, due‘ to an insufficient

1*‘ - "

 

    

number of farmers and inefficien-

c .
3/Finally, there are political
reasons, such as unrealistic prom- ~
ises and expectations. Wells said
that too much was expected too

soon. '

Wells concluded by saying that
“without communication, the‘
conflict between, the industrial
North and the South (Third
.World) can't be solved.” Wells said
that both sides “are lecturing, to
each other, but neither side is
listening." ‘

‘Local PresidentsDiscusscutbacks

Cyert
Stays
Home

 One university president was
absent from Wednesday's press
conference held by area college
and university presidents to
protest the budget cuts in
student financial aid programs.

It was not an illness or a
previous committment that
prevented Carnegie~Mel1on
University President Richard
Cyert from attending, but
personal choice.

“We prefer to work on
internal solutions rather than
political activities. Idon’t think
education should take more
than its share of cuts, but,I also
don‘t think we can expect tobe

‘btiieated in a way that is very
generous with taxpayers’
money at a time when, for the
good of the country, the federal
budget has to be cut,” read a
written statement. Cyert
prepared for the conference.

Cyert told the Post-Gazette in
an earlier interview that he did
not feel it was “proper or
dignified for universities to be
mobilizing their students and
putting presure on legislators
the way some special interest
groups might.”

Chatham College President
Alberta Arthurs criticized
Cyert’s attitude at the opening
of Wednesday's conference.

,,~« V “Compared to the other

7. agencies, education seems to be

taking a drastic, disproportion‘-
ate cut—student aid was cut by
12 percent, while most other
federal programs were reduced
only 4 percent. I have to dis-
agree with my..colleague Dr.
Cyert about what is dignified
for colleges. It's essential to
stand up for our constitutents,”
said Arthurs.

Cyert has assured CMU cam-
A pus that enough funds will be
provided to meet every student’s
‘financial needs through a com-
bination of grants, loans and

jobs, regardless of what
happens on the federal level.
According to Cyert, steps
been taken to generate
extra funds from both
endowment and alumni
contributions.

doctors, scientists, professors,
engineers, managers and experts in
public affairs,” said Posvar, who
said he believes that members of the
executive branch have their
priorities confused in regards to
higher education. “In economic
terms what we are really talking
about is human capital. That is the

product of higher education.

“Human capital——trained
experts and professionals—must
be developed before the physical
capita1—factories, laboratories and
technical services——can reach
meaningful levels. Without a crop
of exciting young leaders and
specialists in all theseareas, the
productivity and prosperity of this
country will suffer." 1'

In making higher education
financially inaccessible to
students, the proposed cutbacks

1 give the country both a shortage of

trained professionals and
technicians and a decline in
quality of life, according to

Community College of Allegheny
County president Laurence Lauth.

“If you thinkghigher education is
expensive, then try ignorance or an
unskilled labor force,” said Lauth.
“A continued investment in
improving our human resources
must_ continue to be a national
-priority.”

The Rev. Donald Nesti,
president Duquesne Univeristy,
warned that the proposed federal
cuts threatan to eliminate students’
freedom of choice of higher
education. A

“I represent what well may
become an endangered species in
the in the future of American
higher education—in private,
church-related institution,” said
Nesti. “The proposed federal cuts
in higher education threaten to
eliminate freedom of choice for
students of all backgrounds many
of our nation’s smaller,
independent institutions simply
will be able to survive the economic
pressures.”

According to Nesti, national

attention is being focused solely on

build-up alone will not insure the
country's security,” Nesti said. “By
building brains rather than bombs,
were ultimately selling the
country short in the long run.”

Colleges will survive if the
proposed cutbacks are passed, but
accessibility to higher education
for those students with limited
finances will become very limited,
said California State College
presidenrjohn Watkins.

“The 14 state-owned schools
exist especially to provide access to
any person in the Common-
wealth,” said Watkins. “The pro-
posed budget cuts threaten this
very philosophy of public
education.”

Citing individual student cases,
Posvar gave a personal insight to

lh€ problems graduate students
will face if the proposed federal aid
.cuts—a package that eliminates
low-interest, state-guaranteed loan
programs-are passed.

If the cutbacks do become reality,
a medical student would be forced
to pay 18 percent interest on his or
her loan while still in school and,
after graduation, would face
“insurmountable” monthly loan
payments of $2,600, Posvar said.

“For the first time in the
university’s history a great number
of our medical school students may
be forced to ‘drop-out of school
because of financial reasons,”
Posvar said. “Anyone who believes
in the well-being of this country
has to ‘believe that higher
education is the best of all public
investments.”

Aid For Med
Students

Students at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine
recently contributed more than
$7,000 to the School’s Kaiser
Fund for scholarship aid. At the
request of Susan Miller and
William Petit, JR, co-presidents
of the Student Executive Com-
mittee, the money will be used
for loans to financially needy

for you

  

students in order that the funds -,

can be reused. In accepting the
contributions, Donald F. Leon,
M.D., dean of the School of
Medicine, praised the students,
saying "Each and every one of
you is to be congratulated for
your effort in raising these.
funds through various projects,
but more importantly for your
concern for the students who
will follow you here at Pitt.
Your thoughtfulness on their
behalf is eloquent testimony of
your fine humane character-
istics.”

The contributions resulted
from fund-raising activities
during 1981 which included a
dinner dance and a fund-raising
letter to the students’ parents
nettingover $7,000. The money
raised by the students, together
withmore than $60,000 donated
by the Medical School's alumni
and more than $83,000 contrib-
uted by the staffs of University
Health Center of Pittsburgh
hospitals, medical societies and
several private foundations,
brings the total money donated
to the Kaiser Fund for 1981 to
more than $150,000.

In ,April 1980, the Kaiser
Family Foundation donated
$100,000 to each member of a
l3—member consortium of med-
ical schools, including the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, for
scholarship use. In addition,
the foundation offered to give

each school in the consortium

the sum of $50,000 during 1981
if the school would match it on
a two-for—one basis, i.e., provide
$100,000. At Pitt, the needed
additional $100,000 was raised
by mid-June of 1981, a full six
months ahead of the deadline.

Stress Doping  
"Examined At

Workshops

The University Counseling and
Student Development Center, in
cooperation with the Student

Health Service, the Women’s Cen- .
ter and the Admissions Office, will '

sponsor a Stress Awareness Week
for all students, faculty and staff
from Mar. 29 through Apr. 1 in the
Student Union.

The goal ofvthe activities is to
focus attention on the many varie-
ties of stress in our normal lives and
advance some methods for coping
more effectively with it.

One of the reasons for the timing
of Stress Awareness»Week is the
upcoming final examination
period, in which normal amounts
of stress are multiplied. Students in
particular may benefit from a
workshop on “Reducing Test Anx-
iety” scheduled for Apr. 1 from 3:30
to 5 p.m. in Room 121 student
union. -

A wide variety of workshops and

~. discussion groups will take place

during the week. "Progressive
Body Relaxation” and “Biofeed-
back” will cover the areas of how

681-1300

one can physically make a differ-
ence in his level of stress by gaining
a greater degree of control over his
body. _, g

In addition, othe groups will
deal with handling the stress
involved in “Personal Loss,” such
as the death of a loved one, “Finan-
cial Stress” and the “Stress in Mak-
ing Career Decisions.” _

Relationships are also a concern
for the university community. One
workshop will address the topic of

. “Communicating with the Oppo-

site Sex,” while another concerns
the “Stress of Ending a Relation-
ship.” “Afterthoughts——After an
Abortion" concernsgthe reactions
women have to a highly stressful
decision. It will be run at the
Women’s Center on Mar. 31 from
6:30 to 8:30 p.m. » _‘

Interested faculty, staff and stu-
dents need not register in advance
for any of the workshops. Work-
shop times and places are available
from flyers that are being distrib-

uted or by "calling the Counseling. I

Center at x5804.

Anyone-Seen
Richard Cyert?

Just ‘because Richard Cyert, president of
Carnegie-Mellon University, didn’t show up at
Wednesday’s summit conference of Western Pennsylvania
educational leaders is no cause to chastise the man,
especially when he is convinced that what he did was the
proper thing. The fact that he didn’t show up, however,
bothers us less than the reasons he gave for choosing not to
state his opposition to proposed financial aid cuts to
education.

Cyert gets the hypocritical statement of the week award
for a quote attrib‘uted% him in yesterday’s Pittsburgh
Press: “I don’t like to see educators getting involved in
political activity,” ‘Cyert said. “We can do things behind
the scenes to get over our point of view.”

Being a university president certainly isn't enough to
i . .~ cause amnesia in an individual; Cyert’s memory can most

‘ likely go back to thissummer. Nevertheless, Cyert seems to

. have forgotten that it was because of his efforts, half the
Pennsylvania Congressional delegation, some of the
highest officials in Taiwan and a Congressional
committee spend countless man-hours and tax dollars in
pursuit of the causes behind CMU statistics professor
Wen-chen Chen’s mysterious death in Taiwan‘ last
summer. '

This is not to say that theinvestigation into death didn’t
deserve all the attention it got. And italso doesn’t mean
that Cyert,s'houldn’t have done everything he did to get to
the bottom of that tragic affair. We commend him for his
efforts in the investigation.

But now, all of a sudden, we see the same man, who was

-/such a powerful force behind all the political efforts aimed
at uncovering the causes for Chen’s death, telling his
colleagues that they’re getting out of line when they

publicly oppose financial aid cutbacks. I

With or without Cyert, the gathering was unique for its

ability to get almost 14 university leaders to agree on one
thing, namely the harmful effects of President Reagan’s
proposed cuts in financial aidxfor the upcoming fiscal
years. Getting together persons such as Pitt Chancellor _

Wesley Posvar, Chatham College President Alberta

Arthurs and the Rev. Donald Nesti, president of Duquesne

University, for anythingmore than a few drinks and an

expensive lunch is an accomplishment in and of itself.

Cyert’s absence from the gathering certainly didn’t stop
the rest of the university administrators from giving a
piece of their collective mind to whomever would listen or
read the newspapers the following day. But Cyert’s
notable absence did put a damper on the ‘event. ‘

It's not that Richard Cyert is such an impressive person,
a reputation further eroded by his behavior this week. But
with the weight of a prestigious institution such as CMU
behind him, Cyert’s word carries much more weight than
it might otherwise, something confirmed by the Wen-chen
Chen incident. A ‘

“We have a bigger responsibility to run our own
institutions and take care of‘our own students,” Cyert
added in yesterday’s Press.

C’mon coach, where’s your team, spirit?

Taking care of “your own students” may be an easy
thing for institutions with $100-million—plus
endowments—such such as CMU-—-but it’s another story
for universities that aren’t so blessed that they can charge
ridiculous tuition fees to pad the university's purse.

Serious financial cutbacks in education shouldbe cause
for alarm by anyone’s standards, especially for those who
have the most atstake when it comes to opposing the cuts,
such as the university presidents. We urge Cyert and

~ anyone else who feels threatened by these cuts to make
their feelings known and not criticize those who do.

Practice PlansCauseConfussi,onr

Dear Editor:

As first-year medical students,
we would like to respond_to the

continuing controversy concern—'

ing the clinical practice plans of
the University Health Center and
their relation to the medical school
budget.'This issue has been raised
most notably by Dr. Robert Glew,
professor of biochemistry’ at the
medical school. Dr. Glew (in the
Mar. 10, Pitt News) charges that the
practice plans return a substan-
tially smaller percentage of their
profits to the medical school oper-
ating budget than do comparable
plans. at most other schools. In
light of recent record-breaking tui-
tion hikes and the possible elimi-
nation of loans /[O graduate
students by the federal govern-
ment, we are certainly concerned
about the veracity of these charges.

The students at presentare unin-
formed and confused about the
financial arrangement between the
practice plans and the medical
school. When this issue was raised
at forums between administration
and students, it was not satisfactor-
ily clarified. To compound this,

‘the silence on the part of the

administration in response to Dr.
Glew's rather serious charges
arouses suspicion in the student
body. In short, we are mystified

Dear Editor:

_ The March lOth.,-Honors Convo- ‘

cation was a very impressive
event—it was well organized and
moved along rapidly. I generally
came away with a warm feeling ofa

g job well planned and executed. _

This impression was to change
starkly when I arrived at Forbes
Quadrangle for the reception.
There I found the opposite, and it
seemed as if two separategroups

. had organized the different parts of

the event. When we finally reached
the table with the refreshments,
after standing in a long line, there
was no food or drink left. There
was no receiving line of any kind or
any other grouping of faculty and
students, and i the band which
played in the corner of a very cha-
otic lobby seemed somewhat out of
place. All in all, it had the effect of a
bucket of cold water after the
solemn ceremony.

Perhaps the money that was
expended for the reception could in
the future better be applied towards
another scholarship or given to a

,university organization.

why the relationship between the
practice plans and the medical
school has consistently remained
enigmatic. _ . ‘

of the practice plans) to address this

Newspaper Opinion Must
Contain All the Facts

Dear Editor:

I am glad to see that my letter of
March 8, I982 (“Column Off
Target On Rapallo”) finally
stirred some response from Scott
Rex. But I am afraid he missed my

‘point on journalistic responsibil-
ity. Part of his opinion was based .

on his knowledge and fact of the
Rapallo Treaty, which I stated he
had incorrectly represented as the
treaty which rearmed Germany
with Soviet aid. Rapallo did not do
this (Rapallo was signed in 1922
and the treaty which rearmed Ger-
many was signed in 1921). The two
treaties were independent in

' motive. My point in restating this

is thus:

If a journalist wishes to express
his opinion or the newspaper’s
opinion, he can do so. I fully
encourage this practice. But if he
does so, he must get all the facts

_ right that he is basing his opinion

on. If he does not, as Mr. Rex did
not, the whole opinion is therefore
jeopardized. The rbelievability of
the writer’s opinion is undermined
as was Mr. Rex’s article of March 3
concerning German rearmament.
That is whatjoumalistic’responsi-
bility is a part of and what The Pitt
News is lacking.

On the one hand, Mr. Rex feigns
comparison to, The "New York
Times but later in the article he

compares himself or The Pitt News’

to Bob Woodward and Carl Bern-
stein and their error in journalistic
responsibility. Can The Pitt News
compare themselves to Woodward

. and Bernstein? But just-because

The Pitt News is neither The New
York Times or Washington Post
does not alleviate them of their
responsibility to accurately report
the news and offer opinion. From
where I sit, The Pitt News has not

clearly and concisely explain the

situation. Doing this, the adminis- ‘

tration seemingly has nothing to
lose, but will have the opportunity
to gain the trust and respect of the
students. .

(Editor’s note: The writers ofthis
letter have asked't0 remain ano-
nymous)..i

done this consistently. iWhen they
consistently report the news accu-
rately, then their just rewards will
follow and errors of responsibility
will not look so glaring. But first,
an excellent track record must b
e‘st‘2IbliShed~.* , A ‘
Finally, I wish to comment on
Mr. Rex’s term or name (I guess he
was calling me this) “First grade
liberal” outlook. I’m notquite sure

’ what this term means, but I think it

was an insult to those of us who
look towards some kind of cooper-
ation instead of conflict with the
Soviet Union. Now I realize the US
shall never be on friendly terms

with the USSR, we are on different 
parts ,of the political spectrum 

(funny, though. how the US sup._
ports so few liberal democracies‘
around the world.) But coopera-

tion of some kind seems to me to be
a much more sane policy than con-

flict and confrontation, which

President Reagan seems to be
pushing the US into. You, Mr.

Rex, as 2} member of the Arms Race
Study Group, should realize the

tremendous destructive force and

potential the US and USSR possess
in both conventional and nuclear
weaponry. Whether the confronta-
tion is direct or through a third
nation, the human suffering is hor-
rible. Let the US instead push for
establishing liberal deomocracies.
This would be one way to stop
communism from spreading, for
we all know a liberal democracy, as
the, US possesses, is much more
humartethan is communism as it is
practiced in the world today. In
closing, if I am a “first grade lib-
eral,” then so be it and thank God
there are some of still around!

  Swiminers At Nationals:

High Hopes in Question

By SEAN BARNES

The Pitt swim team completed
‘the first three days of the Men’s
NCAA National Swimming and
Diving Championships in
Milwaukee yesterday. The
Panthers were entered in two of the
five events, but could not gain
All-America status in either.

“The extremely fast cutoff times

A for National qualification cut the

number of entries considerably this
year,” said Pitt Head Coach Fred
Lewis in a phone interview. Pitt
qualified eight swimmers this year,
which is the average number for
_the Top 20 teams. V
“Texas is strong and well

‘ balanced with 15 men,” said Lewis. .

“But there isn't a clear leader after
fust the first day.”

Both Rick Carter's 50-yard
freestyle» and Pitt's 400-medley
relay of Ed Bergan, Sandy Pigeon,
Geoff Emore, and Carter, failed to
make the finals against
opening day competition.

   

the g

“The lack of swimmers entered
overall because of the stiff cutoffs
created a much weaker-than-usual
meet atmosphere," said Lewis.
“Most everybody seems to have
done the same times they did to
qualify. There were even a couple
events where swimmers made
finals with a time less than'a
national cutoff." '

To gain All-America-status in
this year’s 50-yard freestyle, a
swimmer had to break last year’s
national record. Cutoff times
dropping a full one-quarter second

_per lap left only 20 entries in the

50-freestyle at Nationals.

“The quality swimmers are
here," said Lewis, “But just not
enough of them to keep the overall
enthusiasm up where it should be.
We've made some adiustments in

our -psych and will be ready for the

six events we have left.”

The thirteen events left in the
meet »will conclude by Saturday
night. Pitt has three entries on each
day. Friday ‘will include the

100-yard backstroke with B_e_rga_n,

oougist...m~sn.uatng ability give t$iti'coéot{eobi§y tmssome ilexibtlty with his

the 400-yard individual medley
with Pigeon, and the 800-yard
freestyle relay of Greg Murphy,
_].D. McCrillis, Jerry Zaleski, and
Carter. Saturday will see Pitt in the
200-yard backstroke and breast-
stroke events as well as the 400-yard
freestyle relay. '

It's a new pool for many of this
year’s nationalists at Milwaukee.‘
The two-year-old facility is a-
shallow one which spells more
than average wave problems for
those swimmers in the outside
lanes. There have been no standout
surprises so far, but 13 events still
remain.

The team powers who should i

dominate by Saturday are Texas,
Florida, UCLA, and North
Carolina. Coach Lewis said he
hoped his Panthers have adjusted
to the new complex and the meet’s
atmosphere and look ahead to team
record-setting performances in all
of their events left to swim.
All-America honors are still within
the Panthers’ grasp.

lineup. Lewis has put an emphasis on hitting this year, since the Panthers lack the V
experienced pitchers of season's past.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

As another Pitt baseball season
swings into action, Panther Coach
Bobby Lewis engages in a ritual he
has done to usher his 28 previous
seasons--he crosses his fingers and
looks toward the skies.

It isn't so much for divine
intervention-—although this year’s
young team which numbers 20

freshmen and sophomore members 7

may yet prompt Lewis to pray
before it brings opponents to their
knees. Rather, Lewis’ doleful gazes

are for the inclement northern

weather which has already forced
Pitt to cancel two games last Mon-

day against Baltimore, and threat-
ens to wipe out Sunday’s home
doubleheader‘ against Fredonia
College of New York.

Before their recent trip south to
the Rollins Baseball Week in
Orlando Fla., where the Panthers
finished 0-6, the team had been
practicing almost ‘ exclusively
indoors. Despite the winless streak,
Lewis was encouraged by the trip,
which revealed several things
about his young team, a team with
six new starters and, at times, four
freshmen in the starting lineup.

“We knew going down there that
we were at a disadvantage. They
were our first games on the field,

....

Lewis Searching For Answers

and of course, we had some good
points and we made some mistakes.
But we hit very well,” Lewis said.
“And, we got our young kids'_feet
wet. They saw it's a lot different
than high school ball.’’
The trip, which was funded by
team members’ raffle ticket sales,
afforded Lewis an early chance to
see what Pitt has to work'on head-
ing into the major part of its sche-
dule. Unlike last year’s 25-8 squad,
Lewis’ best team ever, many uncer-
tainties swirl around this year’s
club, including the most basic of
‘questions-.—the starting lineup.

Byrd, Eastern8
Live On,AddTwo

BY AMIIN GHOSSEIN

Call Eastern .8‘ commissioner
Leland Byrd the Cat Man. The
man with the nine lives. The
man with nine teams. ,

With rumors predicting his
league's demise duri_'_ng a stormy
winter—what with charter
member Pitt leavingfor the Big
East—-Byrd rang in the coming
of spring not with a whimper,
but with a bang.

In a press conference Wednes-
day at the Meadowlands in.New
Jersey, Byrd welcomed the addi-
tion of two teams, Penn State
and Temple, bringing the
league's number of teams to
nine. Penn State apparently dis-
sastified with its stature as an
years ago the conference
outlook was bleak," Penn State
Coach Dick I-.Iarter said,
following his N ittan_y Lions

re-admission into the league.

‘‘I'm very optimistic about
the future of the league. Four
years ago the confernce outlook
was bleak," Penn State Coach
Dick Harter said, following his
Nittany Lions re-admission
into the league.

Penn State, which left the
league in search of glory and
prestige" as an independent,
comes back after Joe Paterno’s
Eastern League scheme fell
through‘ and after their own
failure to establish much of a.
reputation as an independent.

“There were only two teams
selected as independents this
year in the NCAA tournament.
That shows you that most of the
interest is in going in the
league,” Harter said. ’

While Penn State might have
settled on the Eastern 8 after
failing on other preferred
options, one of which was
entrance into the Big East,
Templeiwas only too happy_to
accept the offer into Byrd’s
kingdom.

“This is an excellent oppor-
tunity for Temple basketball to

It also gives the Eastern 8 a

This isn't the first time that --
the Eastern 8 has-ventured into
Philadelphia. The first time,

lanova, didn't prove to be too
successful. Small crowds at the
Eastern 8 tournament at the
Spectrum proved to most, that

Five.

Byrd is still anticipating one
more team, most probably St.
Joseph’s will make the
commitment to the Eastern 8
maybe by next season. That ‘
would bring the number to 10, s
the ideal figure for Byrd.

The Eastern 8 or whatever it
will be, lives on thanks to Cat-
Man Leland Byrd.‘

  Muscular

By BRIAN BALK

How many athletes could
capture a body building
trophy? How many‘ athletes
could win this trophy without
any previous muscle building
experience? And how many ath_-
letes could do all this in three

_days prior to a national cham-
pionship meet? Probably none,
unless the athlete was named
Lisa Shirk.

. ﬁnk, an outstanding athlete
\' , ‘Erowned the “Best Built
Women in Pittsburgh" last
Tuesday night at the First Pitts-
burgh Collegiate Body Build-
ing Championships.

This exuberant athlete
excells in another sport which
may appear to contrast the flex-
ing and rippling of muscles-
the sport of gymnastics. Shirk’s
well-toned build has enabled
her ‘to become one of the most
highly-acclaimed gymnasts in
the nation, ~

Shirk’s performance at East-
ern Regional Championships
was good enough to earn her a
bid _to the -two-day NCAA

{aerial Gymnastic Cham-

pionship beginning today in
Salt Lake City, Utah. She was
the only competitor (other than
Penn State Nittany Lions) from
the Eastern region to qualify for
a prestigious invitation.

“I’m going to go out and do
my best. Ijust have to make sure
I keep my head together,” said
Shirk in reference to defending
her second-place national all-
around ranking.

Shirk has been hampered all
season since a January ankle
operation by lack of necessary
practice time. ~ “If I only had
another month to prepare for
nationals Icould do a lot bet-

 said Shirk.

" . owever, there is one source
of optimism Shirk has acquired
for this upcoming meet. It is in
her most consistent event, the
uneven bars.

“If there is anywhere that _I-
could place high, it would be in
the bars. For this year, I guess
my main goal would be to win
the bars.”

This goal is within grasping
distance, for Shirk is this year’s
Eastern champion in the
uneven bars. Shirk is the sole
competitor representing the

‘Lady Panther Squad and will
be competing with the
third-seeded team, the

tions, Shirk has devised a
method which is totally unique
to deal with it.

“In order to deal with my ner-
vousness I wear layers upon lay-
ers of clothes before each event.
Then after each competitor gets

off the apparatus I peal a layer —

off. This not only gets my blood
and sweat flowing, but it also
gives me something to think
about instead of worrying if I’m
going to fall or not,” Shirk
explained.

Before each event, Shirk is
usually leaping and stretching
with her face deeply submerged
in the hood of a ragged blue
Eskimo Parka. Shirk refers to
this refuse from a Good Will
Box as her “security blanket.’_’

' “I didn’t have my parka when
we met Florida; I was cold and
didn’t know what to do!” said
Shirk. ‘

According to Shirk, this
parka also serves another not-
so-obvious function.

“The best thing about my [

parka is that it hides my ner-
vous face,” she says.

Many of Shirk’s opponents
are psyched out by her crazy
antics in that comical parka.
They think she has either got to
be totally nuts or good enough

to do whatever she wants. The "

later opinions usually wins out
when her performances are
observed. However, little do her
adversaries know, but beneath
the torfnage of clothing and
inside that oversized hood, is a
gymnast that is just as nervous
as everyone else.

But away from gymnastics, is
there a future for body-building
in this Shirk’s athletic career?
According to Shirk, definitely.

V“Body build may be really
good to motivate me to get in

shape for gymnastics,” Shirlc‘, I

said. In this competition, where
she ‘captured five of seven possi-
ble trophies, Shirk literally
stole the show.

At first I didn’t know any-
thing, about body-building
competition, then .1 saw all the
other girls posing it up, I did
the same. Then once the
audience started screaming, I
really got into it," Shirk said,
laughing.

“My ambition in life is to be
an ordinary‘ everyday house-
wife, with ordinary domesti-
cated hobbies, like body-build-
ing," Shirk joked.

Whatever aspiration she
chooses to chase, there is one
thing for sure-—Lisa Shirk will
never be considered “ordinary”
She is definitely one of a kind.

Baird Sets His
Way To Honors

By LISA GRENEVICKI

An All-East honoree and a
member of the No. 3 team in the
East. Most players would be
thrilled about it. Not Dave Baird-
he’s out for much more. .

4" Dave “Chubby” Baird has
accomplished plenty in his three
years on the Pitt men’s‘volleyball
team.

Though only a junior on Coach
Ray Reilly's spiker team, Baird has
become an integral part to the
highly sophisticated offense of the
Panthers. ‘

“Baird is the key to our offense,”

said Reilly. “Without him, we
couldn’t run the type of offense we
have.”

As setter, Baird runs the Pitt
offense on the floor. It takes a keen
eye to read the opponent's defense

to know ‘where their blockers are

going to be. > ‘
_ ' “We have the most sophisticated
 offense in the country," explained
Baird. “I like the job of setter,
because I control the tempo of the
game. .
“My job is to set up a player that

isn't going to be blocked. I try to
anticipate who will be open. I
don't know how I do it. I just see
things out of the corner of my eye,"
said Baird. -

“Indisputably, Baird is the finest
setter in the East,” Reilly said.
“He’s an excellent reader of blocks.
Most of the time when he sets, we
get a one—on-one situation.

“He’_s a gifted setter. It’s not
something that is easily learned;
it’s instinct,” Reilly added.

Baird first got interested in vol-
leyball while in ninth grade at Steel
Valley High School. An all-around
athlete involved in football, base-
ball and basketball (besides volley-
ball), Baird gained all—state honors
in volleyball.

“I saw young Mo Williams play
on TV for USC in the Nationals(in
1976) and I was really impressed,”
said Baird. “I was tired of the other
sports. I like volleyball. It’s my
favorite sport because it’s the most
exciting and most interesting to
play.”

In a sport that has few stars,
Baird found he was influenced by

The biggest farce of the year was
Robert Morris competing in that
same tournament.

Father Nesti, president of
Duquesne University, subscribes to
the theory: Act first, think second.

N0rtheastern’s Jim Calhoun was
wise to remove his name from
Duquesne’s slave list.

Whoever says “I wish they all
could be California girls” never
visited the Pitt campus.

continued from page fourteen
Williams and Pitt assistant coach
Mike Gordon. ,

“Young William-s really
impressed me by the way he _could
play and his attitude about the
game,” explained Baird. “(Gor-
don) influenced me because he was

a four-time All-America for Penn‘

St . He showed how a small guy
Jinlay with the tall guys.”

And at just six feet-—not very tall
for a volleyball player—Baird is
also proving he can play with th
“taIl” ones. ~

Another inspiration to Baird is
fellow teammate and team captain
Gary Groshner. /

"(Groshner) really helped me
this year. When you have a dry
spell, it’s not good for your atti-
tude.- When I get down, (Groshner)
picks me up,” Baird said.

One noticeable aspect of Baird's
personality is his overwhelming
confidence——something he demon-
strates on the court with his com-
manding sets and off the court

. 'th his views of Pitt's chances in
&;ﬁast.

With a team goal of winning
Easterns this year, Baird is sure the
Panthers can achieve their goal.

“With the use of our trick
offense, moving the front hitters all
over, we gain an edge over better
teams,” Baird said. “We make up
for talent by running a faster
offense.

“Right now, we're playing our
best," continued Baird. “The guys
on the team are getting the confi-

dence‘ they should have had all
along.

“We have two big matches com-
ing up with Penn State. They lost

one of their good players to ineligi- _

bility and that’.Il give us a psycho-

-ﬁyifal advantage. Our recent split

\ t' them helped us, too. It’s made

pete with them; now we know we
can beat them." ' »

Since two collegiate teams can-
not attend the Pitt Classic this
weekend, ‘Reilly has scheduled
scrimmages_for Pitt. After that, two
matches with Penn State on Wed-
nesday and Apr. 7 have Baird confi-
dent for a ~ fine ending to the
Panthers’ season.

“We haveagood shotatwinning
Easterns and going to Nationals,”
Baird said. “It’s all a matter of
believing and having confidence.
We just have to play up to our
potential and have the mental
confidence.”

Reilly has many praises for this
junior setter.

“Baird has brought more credi-
bility to the Pitt volleyball pro-
gram than any other player,
through his All-East honors and
setting talent,” said Reilly. “He’s
just a great guy."

A Already an All-East player as a
sophomore,-Baird is out for more

in his junior year.

“I want to go to Nationals and
make All-America,” said Baird.
“But to do anything, it takes all six
out on the court. Volleyball is a
team sport. You canshine individ-'
ually, but you need five other guys
(who) can do the job.

“I want to play as well as I can. I
want to get everyone fired up. I'd
rather inspire people with action-
my playing—than with words.”

Baird's outstanding playing
ability definitely says it all.

better hitting lineup, used
Fitzpatrick mostly as a designated
hitter in Florida. '

Major news. . .

Former Pitt coach John Majors
first had to worry about his head
coaching job at the University of
Tennessee. Now, Majors has to
worry about rumors charging him
with drunken driving.

These rumors got so bad that
university president Ed Boling
came to Majors’ defense. Boling
claims that he has found no official
records of Majors’ being arrested or
charged and calls the rumors
“nothing but vicious gossip.”

Because ‘of these drunk driving
innuendos, Majors says he has
stayed away from establishments

I where liquor is served. According

to Majors, who has compiled at
29-27-l mark in five years with the
Volunteers, he has received
nothing but a traffic ticket during
the time he has been at Tennessee.
The coach added he plans to stop
thinking about these rumors.

Williams rejects

American University’s head
coach Gary Williams turned down
the head coaching job at Duquesne
yesterday. Williams, the first man
to be offered the position, cited
“personal reasons” for staying at
Am'erican University. Five starters
returning for the‘ Eagles is
probably the other reason.
‘ Williams was the first man
offered the job. Earlier,
Northeastern coach Jim Calhoun
withdrew his name from
consideration after he was offered a
long-term deal to stay put with the
Huskies. *

Williams is 72-42 in four years at

Nils Lofgren

In a music industry where
quality is determined by quan-
tity (of albums sold) and innova-
tion is likened to duplicating the
sound of REO or Styx it is no
wonder that the presence of a
rock—n-roll prodigy would be
largely ignored by the public
despite the ravings of several
critics. Nils Lofgren is one of
those geniuses who has fallen
victim to the prevailing Ameri-
can preference for generic "cor—

A _ porate rock.”

Yet, Lofgren insists he is not a
victim by any means: "It would
be ridiculous to worry about
such a thing,” he insists, "Sure,
I'd love to reach more people
with my music but I've got no
time to be bitter...to wait for
superstardom would be a real
big distraction—you’ve got to
enjoy what you're doing now.”

For those lacking in back-
ground, Nils Lofgren was more
or less discovered by veteran
rocker Neil Young, who signed
Lofgren on as a guitarist for the
After The Gold Rush album and
tour. Gaining much acclaim as
one of Young's sidemen,
Lofgren went on to front his
own band, Grin, which, though

critically touted, was forced to

disband because of money
problems.

”We were penniless," he
recalls with a hint of remorse in
his voice, "I guess when you
play the big league you've got to
pay the price. The worst part
about it was the negative aspect
of having to break up because
you can't sell an album or make
a profit. Another thing that
bothers me is that the band was
at its peak when we broke
up...but hey," he adds with a
laugh that borders on the sar-
castic, "you gotta eat."

With the dissolution of Grin,
Nils Lofgren entered a solo
career that has spanned several
albums, record companies, and
styles. Two of Lofgren's pre-
vious studio releases, Cry Tough
and most notably lcame To Dance,
both on A&l\/I, elicited hosannas
of excitation from the music cri-
tis' bleachers. In addition, A&M
released an "official" bootleg
limited edition recording of one
of Nils’ live concerts (to radio
stations only) that is in demand
among audiophiles and rock
purists alike.

His most recent album, Night A

Fades Away, is Lofgren's first
album on the Backstreet label
and one that he himself is proud
of. "Yeah, I'm real happy with
it," he says, "It's 40 minutes of
the most consistent music I've
done. I try to keep changing the
format of my albums——this one
was polished, clean, and very
tight...Now for my next release
I'd like to capture a raw, live
edge to the music," he says, ”I
love the live aspect of music."
Night Fades Away was produced
by Jeff Baxter (Doobies/Steely
Dan) and also has a guest
appearance by Del Shannon
within its grooves. One other
noteworthy aspect of the
album, besides its musical con-

tent, is Lofgren's dedication of l

 

the release to the Vietnam
Veterans. Although he pro-
fesses no special involvement
with the Veterans’ cause he will
admit that the Vietnam War
was a tragic annal of American
history. "I was of age then," he
explains, "I couldn't pass the
physical, but I saw what hap-
pened to my friends—it was a
tragic thing I guess this is just
my. way of expressing my
sympathy."

Next to his love of his music
and his family, Lofgren is an afi-
cionado of athletic sports. A
former gymnast, he enjoys
playing basketball and basically
staying in shape. While on the
road, Lofgren finds his sport
onstage every night of a show.
His concerts have the trade-
mark of being very energetic,

often ‘employing mini—tramps «

and what-have-you to trans-
form a rock concert into a quasi-
Springsteen extravaganza of
movement and energy. Lofgren
tends to find a cathartic value
within the exertion of a night's
gig. "All great entertainers put
themselves out on a limb physi-
cally," he says, "To me, sweat-
ing for two hours is a very
purifying experience." I
Somewhere along the line,
with his penchant for electric
concerts and his image as one of

the last rock—n-roll innocen_ts- "

/purists, Nils Lofgren has been
compared to Bruce

Springsteen—frequently. Non- e l
' etheless, he is not at all bothered

by this often overshadowing
com arison In fact during one

of Lofgren's shows at the Royal
Manor Club in Jersey, he was
joined onstage by Springsteen
for a version of "Lucille" that
brought the house down. "I
really enjoyed it," said Lofgren,

. "I got to be lead guitarist for

once and I was able to sit back
and enjoy Bruce."

Most recently, Lofgren has
returned from a holiday tour of
England that was a notable suc-
cess. His future plans include
work on a new album that is
tentatively scheduled for
release this summer and a late
summer-early fall tour of the
States. ”I like to keep a perpetual
cycle going -of putting out an
album and touring," he says.

At this point it becomes
obvious that Lofgren is not only
a survivor but a winner when it
comes to the music industry. He
has transcended that level of
craftmanship in which the
"artist" is concerned solely with
producing a product that sells
and has occupied a niche that
does not allow compromise in
producing purist rock-n-roll.
Perhaps Lofgren himself sums
it up best when he says: "I've got
to be in my own world. The
music business is-a rotten busi-

ness and it keeps my hands"

full——you have to be very care-
ful. However, I'm not worried,"
he says, "My age doesn't worry
me nor does the amount of
records I sell, etc. Ipay attention
to what I can control now and I
(now right now that I feel confi-
Ilent that I'm good enough to
eat sleep and play my music..."

By JANE HOLAHAN

Home is a celebration of life key-
ggholed into Crossroads, a small black
' town in North Carolina. There is a
sense of resiliency in Cephus Miles,
the man whose life is chronicled in
the-play—-a sense that he cannot be
kept down or confined by other peo-
ple's beliefs.

Maybe it is just a coincidence, but
the same can be said about the author
of Home, Samm Art Williams. Born
and bred in North Carolina, Williams
defied just about everything that
society expected from him. Instead of
becoming the football player that
God intended him tobe (he's 6'4”, and
a good 200 pounds) he wrote love
poems to his high school sweetheart,‘
read books like Wuthering Heights (his
all time favorite novel) and eventu-
ally created Home, his poetic tribute to
the people he knew growing up in
North Carolina.

-Williams was never interested in
what society expected from him, not
when he was a child, and not now,
when he is a leading black playwright.
In fact Williams dislikes the idea that
he is a spokesman for anyone. "I
never speak for the black man, there
are just too many blacks to be able to
speak for -them; there's too much di-
versity. For instance I hate Jessie
Jackson, he isn't speaking for me, and
I resent the assumption that he is.
You shouldn't let people speak for

ll

ou. -

Williams is just as happy about the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre's produc-
tion, which is running through April
25th (students can buy tickets for $3
fifteen minutes before curtain, call
323-1900). "I wrote the play for a
small stage, it's an intimate play. Ilike
‘this production a lot."

Homeiis a three character play, but
dozens of other characters float

:Plath: Portrait To Open Tonight At
3 PLT

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

The Pittsburgh Laboratory Thea.-
tre will present a revival of one of its
most successful productions, Sylvia
Plath: A Dramatic Portrait, opening
tonight and running through April
25. Originally produced in 1977, the
play is being remounted for the com-
pany's Tenth Anniversary Season.
PLT subscribers were polled to select

revivals for the celebration, and
Artisit Director Bill Royston reports
that eighty percent of them opted for
O the Plath piece.

g Plath is perhaps best known for her

: ‘ : early poetry volumes, Ariel and Colos-

0 5145, and her compelling novel, The Bell
:]ar. Using Plath’s poetry, prose, diar-
.ies, and letters, director Kate Roys-
:ton has fashioned a sort of theatrical
Ocollage which follows the writer

plays (among others) Pattie Mae
Wills, Cephus’ love interest through-
out the play.

Nadyne Cassandra Spratts has an
amazing diversity, which makes up
for her some time weak readings of
the lines. When she is ‘given the
chance to approach a new characteri-
zation (mostly in the second act) she
stuns the audience with her versatil-
ity, and etches a memorable character
in minutes.

Home is a poetic play-—there is no
basic plot structure, or consistent

characters. Instead the play revolves

around Cephus, and the two women, ‘

who play among others, his mother,
girlfriend, friends, a prison guard, a

prostitute, and on and on. At first the
CCOOOOOOOOOOOCUUCUUOOOCC..

myriad of events and people flowing
through the play is confusing, but
things slow down to a pace that
becomes natural and exhilarating
(though maybe the audience just
becomes used to the fast pace and
grows to accept it). Either way, by the
end of the play the odyssey of Cephus
Miles has taken on an emotionally
high pitched, moving flavor.

As Cephus, a man drawn to the
land, but driven away from it because
he has refused to fight in Vietnam,
thus ending up (after five years in
prison) in New York City, finding his
need to once again return home, Carl
Crudup is wonderful. The demands

on him are extreme because he has to
anchor the play amidst the flowing
structure of the characters, and keep
us interested in Cephus, while at the
same time we have lallthe other char.-
acters to drink in. That he succeeds is
terrific, that hesucceeds as well as he
does is remarkable. I
Religion is a running theme

throughoutthe play. Sly references 

to God's vacationing in Miami Beach
remind us of Cephus’ misforturnes,
as he desperately tries to get holdof
him.

Williams notes that sometimes, it
seems that maybe God is away on
vacation. "Miami—have -you ever
been to Disney World? I figured if
God wasn't there when ou wanted

him to be, where would he go? Miami
of course. There's God laying on the
beach, getting a tan, and if‘he's black
getting a darker tan, thinking of
nothing but himself. Idon’t ever go to
church though, there's too much
hypocrisy, but I think God exists
somewhere."

Religion is a strong theme in Home,
probably because Williams grew up in
a deeply religious atmoshpere. ”My
aunt used to give me these fire and
brimstone speeches that scared the
hell out of me, but they gave me a
strong backbone. But once ‘those
women went into church you

through the various stages of her life’
and climaxes with her suicide at 32.

"Don't expect a dry poetry read-
ing,” com-mented Royston. "It is a
dramatic portrait, moving, funny,
sad, bitter. Much of her later work
was intended to be heard rather than
read."

Portrait features three actresses,
Patricia Grace, Caryl Opshinsky, and
Janet Robb. Orshinsky is a member of
PLT’s original cast. Royston has
ma.de major changes from the 1977
version, and the actresses contrib-
uted to the restructuring process-

"I had to make changes,” sa_ys

Royston. "I knew that this section
just didn't work, that one wasn't
explored enough. So the actresses
were given specific assignments, the
diaries or the letters, for instance,
and then they were to bring their
work back into rehearsal. The ground
rules were that we were to work
together, but as the director I made
the final decisions as to what worked
or what didn't." .
Royston and her actresses use a
number of realization techniques to
prevent Portrait from turning into
"reader's theatre or coffeehouse poe-
try readings from the 60's. I find

THE TIME   01-‘ YOUR LIFE

The Time of Your Life

By CHISTOPHER APPLEGATE

William Saroyan’s The Time of Your
Life opened at the Booth Theatre on
Christmas night, 1939, and became a

‘ hit with critics and audiences alike.

When read today, the script seems
like a lovely piece of Americana, with
its romantic images of workers and
prostitutes and its endearing social
misfits. The faded production photos
of Julie Haydon and Eddie Dowling

Q__are charming; the-play would seem to

an

      

grant us access into that simple, big-
hearted U.S.A. glimpsed cinemati-
cally in films such as Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington and It's A Wonderful Life.
The charm of the printed page does
not, however, survive the transition
to the 1982 stage. Saroyan’s play

seems merely dated, and many of his '

observations have degenerated into
naive cliches. Life lacks the guts of
Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh
(written the same year and set, sim-
ilarly, in the bar) or the tight struc-
ture of Thornton Wilder's Our Town
(which was produced two years ear-
lier and has survived countless ama-
teur and high school revivals. Life

tries too hard to trade on its whimsi-
cal charm; the charm’ is shopworn,

By WALTTER WATSON

The more one thinks of how unus-
ual and turbulent the late 1930's and
late 1960's were in American history,
it only becomes more difficult to con-

“sider the disparate periods as twin

sons of different mothers.

between the two time frames as
examined by ‘Edward Albee's The
Death of Bessie Smith and Sam Shepard’s

however, and it cannot sustain our

J (attention for three hours on its own..

Good acting can, though, and there
is an abundance of that in John Don-
nelly’s Life now running at the Fine
Line Theatre. Some of Donnelly’s

 

Liberman gives us a gutsy, powerful
Kitty whose ultimately revealed
vulnerability becomes all the more
touching. Bearlike, boyish Dan Wyse
is an absolute delight as the guileless
flunky. Tom; Philip Winters offers

CI-IARD LAWLESS AND US-

YOUR LIFE  _, . _. .  
actors are able to transcend the thin-

ness of the Saroyan_ script; when they

take the stage we really are at Nick's
Bar and Grill in San Francisco, it is
October, 1939, and yes, we are hav-
ing the time of our life.

Lois Liberman’s Kitty Duval is a
surprise. Instead of a fragile fallen
angel under a hooker's hard makeup,

burgh‘s Studio Theatre productions
of these’ two one act plays put viewers
on the edge of their seats. The

I uncommon vitality, volatility, and

haunting resonance of both plays
come to fore in their visions of survi-
val, politics, and reality.

The Death of Bessie Smith features a
tough cast of players with a story that
climbs far beyond the realm of the
black blues queen who died unable to
get medical attention from racially

«segregated hospitals. Karla Boos is

 

TAVE     A

  
 

boundless energy and deft comic tim-
ing as the would—be standup, Harry.

Two performances stand out even
among these standouts. Director
John Donnelly’s Nick is the prototyp-
ical -American bartender, part father
confessor, part protector, and part
streetwise philosopher. Gustave

‘Wiedl’s Kit Carson is nothing short of

brilliant, and he effortlessly domi-
nates every scene in which he
appears. Ironically enough, his incon-
gruous, larger-than—life Western
character is the most vividly real per-
formance in the cast. _ .

Donnelly’s cast is of high quality,
and honorable mentions must go to
actors Harold Kaufman, R.G.
Caughey, Jennie Lindsey, and Wil-
liam Laux. Richard Lawless is shallow
and unconvincing in the pivotal role
of Joe, however, and the cast is pep-
pered with a few amateurish, artifi-
cial actors, most notably Fred
Donatelli as Blick.

Designer Al Dirshman’s dreamlike

set is quite beautiful, but somehow 9

seems :stylistically' out of step with
the production. Make-up designer
Jerry Gergley has done his work for a
forty-foot proscenium stage, unless
it was his intention to show us people
with lines painted on their faces.

In all justice toDonnelly, it must be

said that many of Life's problems I

would undoubtedly have been solved
if his attention were not divided
between his directing and playing
Nick, a part he could not cast. Despite
the rough spots, The Time of Your Lifeis
a worthwhile evening in the theatre,
and can be seen at Fine Line through
April 4.

especially ”trashy” as the bigotted

nurse who refuses to give Bessie L

Smith any attention before she's
good and ready. Thexsharp perfor-
mances by Tom Mendicino, Sharon
Fallon, and Monte Russell make the
heat and frustration in 1937 Mem-
phis very tense, true to its ugly set of
sensibilities.

Fallon plays a sultry, evil desk
nurse at a Memphis hospital who
teases and spites her suitor (played by
Mendicino). He finds her to be the
alluring and repulsive paradox of
southern womanhood. Her father
(played by David Doepken) is a
deathly-ill redneck, anxious to get rid
of her daughter's persistent tortur-
ing as he is to be done with his mis-
erable life. She is most bitter in her
hatred for the hospital's Negro
Orderly (played by Lamont Arnold),
and constantly reminds him that he is
a ”boy,” a ”nigger" with no future
beyond taking orders.

Fallon’s nurse is loud and arrogant;

cackling with the power to'brutally I

shake up the pléy’s tensions‘. This
character's urgency hurls Albee's
play about shattered dreams into the
same shamelessness and wreckless-
ness that opens the play, as Bessie’s
friend Jack (Monte Russell) and Ber-
nie (John Wanamaker) meet with
wide, warm smiles and heavy,
drunkenlaughter of hopes yet to be
crushed from without the temporal
world of its dreamers. ,,

Sam Shepard’s Cowboy Mouth, as

‘performed by Patricia Hicok as

Cavale, Torn Mendicino as Slim, and
Lamont Arnold as the Lobster Man,
is even more reeling. ‘

Slim and Cavale, pleasure seekers
in the acidic, ”Hello, I love you" ’60's
attempt to sidestep middle American
values for nirvana, Cro-Magnon eti-
quette and the generous mentality of
”Do Your own thing, man.”

Can rock 8: roll stardom bring
meaning to the lives of Cavale and

Slim? The question resolves itself in ~

part by the strong metaphorical tie
that Cowboy Mouth brings to Albee's
Bessie Smith, in which a black man
involuntarily replaces his white
counterpart to create the strong sug-
gestion of no exit. With Cowboy's cou-
ple, one can only think of Osbourne's'
Look Back In Anger for its sad humor,

and its frustrations of yet another _

generation living with deferred
dreams.

Director Hugh MCD. Scott (Cowboy)
and Patricia Hicok (Bessie) have kept
the high, essential levels of con-
sciousness needed to achieve
bouyancy in their characters. The
direction in both’ plays is imaginative
andengaging, qualities that streng-
then their wicked and ponderous

tnessages for today.

MICHAEL ‘CAINE

 

By JANE HOLAHAN

M_OM’S= ADVICE is ALWAYS THE Bizsr

If Michae'l:C'aine had his way with movie making everything. would
disappear—the actors, the director, and the camera. "Great directing is to
i ' make the camera disappear and the director disappear,” insists Caine, ''you
should no longer see any acting or any example of the fact you had a script
or‘_.did any rehearsing. You're just whoever you're supposed to be."

This philosophy is drawn from his mother's advice———be like a duck;
“ remain calm on the surface and paddle like hell underneath. S_ays Caine:
'l”You shouldn't be able to see the wheels going round in a film."

-”I remember working on a film with this director who shall remain
nameless because of what I'm about to say. We were shooting a scene and I
noticed the lens going in and out, which meant the shot was going into close
‘' up»-all the time, and I cut the scene and told the director, ’look, you've paid
-‘me a great deal of money to be in this movie so why don't you let me act.’ He
was showing his mom what a great director he was, you know, ‘look ma, I'm
directing!’ " '

Dubbed the Cockney Cary Grant, Caine has remained true to his ideals.
His performances always look easy, as though he were simply playing
himself, but for Caine that is’ the greatest compliment an actor can receive.
”In the movies, if someone tells you, ’I thought you played that part very
well,’ that's nice, it's a compliment of a kind. But if someone says, ‘You are
playing yourself, you're very similar~to that character,’ then you know
you've done it because they think it's you. They think it was a real person."

‘Caine admires Humphrey. Bogart, Spencer Tracy and French actor lean

let the chips fall where they may and played the person rather than the part.
Disappearing into a character is the hardest thing to do in films. Bogart,
‘ Tracy and Cabin were masters of this, and in the memory of people in
cinema those are the ones who have survived." I

THE CAINE MUTINY

Survival is something Caine knows about. The Cockney accent that
flavors all his roles is genuine; he grew up in London's Southwark area, a
poor and rebellious kid (his stage name is taken from the Caine Mutiny). In
' a tight class structure like England's, acting seemed the only means of
escape. "It was the only thing, from my background which was a very poor,
working class background, it was the only thing you could do without a
technical education. I became an actor as a means of escape from where I
was, which was in the pitts—-the bottom of the social scale. If you have no
racial minorities, as England didn't, then you make a racial minority out of
your own race and religion. We were the equivalent in England of black
. people in the United States. We were used as laborers and all__tlTé crap jobs
and we were ill—educated. Specifically Cockneys, whicl/1,. is-what I was."

Caine had no desire to be locked into this class structure, so instead he
took the world by storm with two concurrent performances that indelibly
influenced the film world. Harry Palmer, the near—sighted, poor, unglam-
ourous. spy in the lpcress File (1965) was a contradiction to the James Bond
norm, while /llfie (1966) changed the British/romantic hero for all time to
H§.QLne- ‘

person, but his performances are always genuine and complete.

(Cabin because the acting wheels never showed in their performances.
"They underplayed according to the methods of acting of their time. They ”

Caine was never your typical movie star. "With the parts I'm, given I must
look very strange,” laughs Caine. "Isee myself as a rather heavy, aging-
Leslie Howard, but a lot of people must see me as Klaus Kinski because Iget
really strange parts. But I don't want to repeat roles. If I'm playing a

murderer I don't want to do that again. When I played Alfie I was then ‘ ll

offered 25 Alfies of this guy screwing every girl in sight. I want to have
diversity." , E
What remains consistent‘ in Caine's performance is a low key dignity to
his characters. This low key style may have made him an underrated
actor———people don't notice how hard he works on a performance——yet that's’
the way he wants it. Through everything Caine maintains his basic core. He

may not metamorphisize (a la Robert DeNiro) into a completely different

FAMILY MAN A

It's sort oflodd to hear Michael Caine talk about his family. In his screen
roles there is always a touch of Alfie the rouge, but when he talks about his
wife of twelve years and his eight—year—old daughter, the deep devotion he

has to them comes through clearly. "My family goes everywhere with me._%;,
1

If the film is in a place where you can't take children I turn it down.'I'd rathel
miss a good film than a good family. It's not that you're going to find other
people, it's that you start leading parallel lives, and no matter how innocent
or blameless your life is, parallel lines never meet again. And I think if you
have a child you should spend time with them." I ~

The Caine's lead a low key life in‘Los Angeles, occasionally going to New
York, but mostly staying at home. Caine's hobby is watching the news on
television. "This new cable network is great. 24 hours of news a day,'so they
have to give you everything!” '

THE SYLVESTER METHOD

_Caine does not stand by any particular method when it comes to acting
(his mother's advice not withstanding) but for his latest role, as Sidney

Bruhl, a burned oiﬁ/semi—psychotic playwright in Deathtrap, he does have a 
rather unusual modus'operandi'. ”You know Sylvester and Tweety Pie? Well I ’V%*

based my character on that." .

Sidney Bruhl is a rather desperate man. He hasn't had a hit play in years,
so when a student sends him a fool proof thriller that he knows will become
a hit, Bruhl decides to murder him and attach his own name to the play.
"He's an arch cynic," says Caine, ”everything seemed OK to him, even the
most dastardly things and- that's exactly the way Sylvester goes about
trying to kill Tweetie Pie all the time. He's always got this wonderful smile
on his face and he's always very charming. So I based my character on
that—the guy is stark raving mad, just like Sylvester."

Caine does not inhabit his characters. ”I would have hated to be Sidney
Bruhl 24 hours a day, and I would HATE my wife to have to live with Sidney
Eruhl 34 hours a day. No, I just leave the character at the studio when Igo

ome. «

Derithlrap is a beautiful example of Caine's skill as an actor. He manages to’ ’..j:‘

make. us believe he is "merely" playing himself as he portrays a raving
lunatic———that s no mean feat. He makes it look simple. Iguess mom's advice
was the best; glide through your role and don't let anyone see you're

paddling like hell underneath " ‘

the opportunity to carry the bulk of a
film on his talents alone. He may not
have succeeded, but how many have?

The movie opens with some starkly

Richard Pryor, an acquired taste,
proves once again that he is very pos-
sibly the funniest man in America;
and that's not just because the com-
mercials say so. His newest film,
Richard‘ Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip, is
even better than his first concert
film.

 Dressed in a red suit with a black

"*ﬁirt and gold boots, Pryor takes

command of the stage, turning it into
a comic gymnasium. Pryor struts,
paces, rants and raves himself into a
tornado of rapid-fire anticdotes. The
man has a style all his own——you
might call it sort of an urban classic
sarcasm style. He attacks everything
from prison convicts to Playboy bun-
nies’ apartment decor, with a sort of
wit that looks so spontaneous, you'd
never think of doubting it.

Pryor also covers the topic that
everyone wants to hear about: his

Cident. What was actually free-
basing, is devised into a story so prep-
osterous thatone might believe his
sincerity. Pryor says that before he
goes to bed at night he has his favor-

ite snack, milk and cookies. One night
he saw that he onlyhad a little bit of
homogeous vitamin D milk left, so he
mixed it with low-fat milk, and, it
exploded! ”Scientists are still trying
to figure out what happened!" said
Pryor.

Veteran director Joe Layton,
whose successes on the stage include
Barnum, The Sound of Music and George
Ml, gave Pryor complete freedom, as

faras material and movement were

concerned. Layton was probably
more responsible for organizing the
concerts (smoothly edited into one),
that appeared for two consecutive
nights at the Hollywood Paladium
earlier this year. Cinematographer
Haskell Wexler (Who's Afraid of Virgi-
nia Woolf? and Coming Home) used six
cameras on stage, so as to not miss
one move the comedian made.

It is impossible to watch Pryor per-
form without seeing the pain he had
to overcome. It's not a matter of feel-
ing sorry for him at this late stage,
but it is clear that his accident (from
which his life was barely saved), has
had a great impact on his humor.
Funny as he is, Pryor gives us an
honesty that is rarely seen in the best
of performers.

  

 

communist block countries such as
Czechoslovakia to kill off their elite
terrorist, Heller needs the help of his
menacing employer. To get that help,
Heller digs up some dirty laundry
with which to blackmail the higher
ups ‘into a few weeks traing at "agent
camp" and the contacts "necessary to
get behind the Iron Curtain. Without
giving away the good parts I can tell
you that what ensues is a series of
plot twists and changing identities

which provide for well paced action I

and a movie that's worth seeing.
Savage may fail to dominate the
screen’ but the weaknesses are
absorbed bya fine overall repertory
performancelheaded by Christopher
Plummer's portrayal of Czech pro-
fessor and intelligence chief Antonin
Lakos. Also on hand are a group of

excellent‘ Canadian actors, most not- .

able of whom are Ian Rubes who

plays the murdered .gir'l'sfather and

JOHN SAVAGE IN THE AMATEUR

Heller's confidant and Nicholas Cam-
bell who chills as the Freedom Figh-
ters’ leader, Horst
Savage's work early on manages to
convey Heller as a quiet, pensive man
chock-full of frustration. However,
given the opportunity to vent those
emotions, Savage appears to hold
back and thus never fully convinces
us that Charles Heller has been

pushed far enough to want to kill.

Nevertheless, The Amateur concerns
itself ultimately with the CIA and fit-
tingly possesses all the smooth-edged
polish of its subject. The Amateur and
all of its predecessors emerge cycli-
cally like trial balloons that test our
distrust of an institution that has
long lurked in the shadows. If you're
the type who needs its daily slogan

and Erma Bombeck wit to attack our ’

cold diabolis ex machina world then
The Amateur provides a dose of suspi-
cion and a measure of intrigue to con-
firm your worst fears. N

There were two opening

covers such as "Pretty Woman”
and ”Mony Mony”in addition to
originals, and had the crowd

THE WAITRESSES
Heaven
March 11, 1982

. Standing in the crowd at
Heaven tonight I was bom-
barded by the usual show of
colors and fashion that seems to
invade this nightclub's innards.
the kaleidoscope of
colors, there was also an air of
electricity pervading the atmos-
phere tonight. If not'from' the
static, electricity those
designers’ knits caused, the aura
seemed to arise from the fact
that The Waitresses, music's
latest offering of female-
oriented rock-n-roll, were here
tonight.

Soon, the first band, the Tril-
lionires, took the stage as the
blond-haired, made-up lead sin-
ger grasped the microphone in

 both hands and broke into a

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

1950's swing song. I shuddered
at the sound and nearly became
depressed as the second song
produced the same 50 s rhythm.
Nevertheless, from then on it
was bliss. The Trillionaires left
behind past decades’ music
styles and slid into contempor-
ary punk and new-wave styled
songs. The band was really tight
and after the final song eve-
ryone cried for more. Eventu-
ally, the uncompromising
crowd got them back on stage
for a couple more tunes.
Upon completing their
encore, the Trillionaires exited
and after a few equipment
changes, the band members of
the Waitresses climbed onto the
stage. Patty Donahue, the lead
vocalist, followed shortly after
coming face to face with a glit-
tering, excited crowd. Standing
on the stairs, I watched as peo-
ple clamored toward the stage
shouting and waving their arms
to the opening song, "Wise Up.”
Dressed in a black miniskirt, a

I conservative white blouse-.and

forever clenching a cigarette

between her fingers, Donahue
spelled out the words to several
of the songs off the group's
debut album that kept the
audience swinging and dipping.
Her voice was a decisive tool
that she used to hammer out
her ‘feelings about women's
perspectives and what is
expected of them in our society
(a -view which she strongly
opposes).
' "What's a girl to do
scream and screw
No! Pretty victories.

Patty used very powerful and
deliberate gestures to nail her
opinions into the audience while
her tone and facial expressions
displayed a "Just try me!" atti-
tude. Actually, Donahue
sounded very much like she
does on the album with that
same sarcastic back tone to her

into her scathing lyrics.

Mars Williams, on reeds, was
Patty's exact opposite franti-
cally running about the stage as
though he had dropped 5 speed-
ers. For all I know, he very well
might have.

Throughout the show, all
eyes were drawn to the stage
while minds and bodies
absorbed the beats and lyrics of
each consecutive song. Finally,
it was time for the big hit, "I
Know What Boys Like.”
Throughout the song, Mars’
role played a boy seeking favors
of Patty until they reached a
point in the song where Patty
sarcastically enunciated
"sucker" followed by a sneer.
Mars picked his composure up
off the floor and crept back to
his side of the stage.

A few songs later, the show
came to an end with the crowd
clamoring for more. After a
number of minutes, the band
ascended the stage and dove
into the title track of their
album, "Wasn't Tomorrow
Wonderful?" They finished up

This concert has quite a few
firsts--the first time a warm-up
group started on time; the first
time the warm-up group had" a
standing ovation and an encore;
and the first time Pure Prairie
Leaue failed to deliver a good
concert.

It's wasn't as if Pure Prairie
League didn't try; first the
sound was poor, then it seemed
that they were going after the
rock and roll fans and not the
fans that love their mixed blend
of country—rock.

It was only when were over
half-way through the concert
that their talent finally surfaced

sandwiched between "Hand

Devil.”

After that it was "Two Lane

Ready" for the encore and- the
concert was over. _

Notable, though, was Al
Garth, the new saxman the
band recently picked up, whose
Great Gatsby-like appearance
was soundly applauded.

Long before the end of PPL’s
finish, people were streaming
out._But for the Corbin-Hanner
Band, fans were far from walk-
ing out on them. They were on
their feet from "Let it Roll" on.

The hit "Excuse Me Ma'm,
Where's the Door?" was fol-
lowed by country hit after hit.
"One Fine Morning" is just one
example and their rendition of
"Jailhouse Rock" was the best

result? A tedious rompitthrofugh
white funkland with a band that
sounds as if it should have
stayed in the garage—with the
motor running. The only half-
way decent cut is "Cowboys In
Africa" and that's only because
it's such an insipid song that it
makes you laugh—-at it, not
with it.

Someday Tommy Tutone will
find success - but not just yet.
This group has stashed away all
the potential necessary, and if
they could only be caught cross-
ing the border from mediocrity
someone might notice them.

Tommy Tatone—2 gives new
meaning to two-sided recording
because, although the material
remains consistently agreeable
throughout, the production is
”schizo.” The problem arises out
of the fact that with exception
of lead singer Tommy Heath
and guitarist Jim Keller, sides
one and two are the work of two
different bands, two different
production—engineering teams,
and two different time periods.

What emerges from this
"duplexity" makes you wonder-
what a little consistency might

to have been individually
designed and pasted together.
But like home-made cookies
(the Nestle recipe instead of
Chips Ahoy), it's got an extra
spark that gives it an original
flavor.

Pittsburgh's answer to a cross
between the B-52's and OMD,
the cardboards have a knack for
matching disparate lyrics to
quirky, synthesized back-
grounds. The words and music

have done. Side one boasts the
rocketing single "867—
5309/Jenny" that could proba-
bly ride on the_ irresistable
numerical hook even if it wasn't
a great song. "Shadow On The
Road Ahead" and "Why Baby
Why" lead one to flattering
comparison's with the Califor-
nia band of a decade ago, Cree-
dence Clearwater Revival.
Heath's strong vocals are not
quite as strong as Fogerty's but
they possess an added dimen-
sion, a Petty-like drawl that
works well, especially on the
slower numbers.

Side two stands on shakier
production grounds, but con-
tains the better material in the
moving ballad of small town
love gone astray. ”No Way To
Cry”, and a straight up rocker,
”Tonight", that's as close to the
Houserocker sound as a band
from California can get.

impersonal tundra of boredom
("On The R=TZ" and "Gravity's

The only drawback may be

THE CONCERT IN CENTRAL
PARK

Simon and Garfunkel

Warner Brothers

On September 19, 1981, half
of a million people crowded into
Central Park to see the reunion
of two men who had made their
musical mark in the late 60's and
early 70's, splitting soon after
that to go onto mediocre solo
careers. The men are Paul
Simon and Art Garfunkel; the
concert is history.

Simon and Garfunkel always
produced albums that featured
perfect vocal harmonizing and

o

est thing Pittsburgh has to a
folk hero and, as listening to His
Own Kind will attest, McCul— 
lough takes his position
seriously.

Without a doubt, this album is
enchanting. McCullough has
formed an entourage of home-
grown musicians including
Ernie Hawkins and Gary Jacobs
(Highway Ghost) that breathes
a certain native vitality into the
album.

The album is a potpourri of
Irish traditional and dance
tunes, rockabilly, country and
western, and a few classic drink-
ing ditties. McCullough con-
jures ’up subtle, magical images
of such legends as Pete Seeger,
Jim Croce,...even Woody Guth-
rie. Yet, McCullough is his own
man——he's new blood with new
ideas——he’s someone to pay
attention to.

Notable cuts on the album
include"No Need to Worry,” a
warning about Three Mile
Island, "Pittsburgh Bound,"
"Patrick Sheehan," "Pas De Sor-
tie," and a warming "Can't
Blame It On the Beer."

The Concert In Central Park has
these same trademarks and
other fine points that make it a
great album. The best thing
about the record, though, is it
makes you feel like you're sit— _
ting in the crowd. The recording 
isso good, nothing is missed.

Another of the finer points is
the song selection. All the songs
that made the duo what they
once were are included-—-"Mrs.
Robinson," "Scarborough Fair,"
"Bridge Over Troubled Water,"
"The Sounds of Silence," and so
much more.

Simon and Garfunkel's The
Concert In Central Park is highly
recommended; it is well worth
the twelve dollar price tag. The
album comes with a photo and 
lyric booklet and 19 of the best

songs on today's market.

from references to everyday

rison is making music not to be
accepted by critics, but to satisfy
his soul. There is a lot of hidden
meaning here; songs of mists
and stairways and Irish muses-
things which are obviously close
to his heart, but defy strict
interpretation.

Like many of his previous
records, this is an album of soft,
melodic music, filled with
romanticism and soulful har-
monies. "Aryan Mist" and
"Accross The Bridge Where
Angels Dwell" are two of the
best examples of this, with
Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits
guesting on guitar in the

- rhythm section. There is also an

interesting instrumental,
"Scandinavia,” which features
Morrison on piano.

All in all, Beautiful Vision is an
album of romantic appeal, music
that creates an entire atmos-
phere. While its commercial
acceptance is very doubtful, it is
another beautifully crafted
piece of work from a master
musician.

By GEORGE HOLZER

The scene backstage after the Outlaws’
show (Feb. 25 at the Syria Mosque) was
chaotic; about 20 people were waiting to go
upstairs to the dressing area. Most notable of
these guests was Myron Grombacher,
drummer of Pat Benatar's band. Myron had
helped Freddie Salem, Outlaw gu‘itarist/vo-

' calist, do his solo album and had come by to see

Freddie.
I was soon ushered upstairs and introduced
to bassist Rick Cua. Rick was at-"ease and very
friendly; he told me a great deal about himself
and Outlaws.
SHOWCASE: I know you are from
the local band circuit in Syracuse,
New York. How did it feel moving up
to an act with the status of the
Outlaws?
Rick: It was great. I had been playing

 
 
 
   

New York forever...well, at least all-

. my life. I'veIplayed everything, you

name it——bar mitzvahs, weddings,
nightclubs, fraternities, concerts,
EVERYTHING. But, the Outlaws
was definitely,my* big break, so to
speak. It's been great.

SHOWCASE: How did The Outlaws
find a Yankee bass player?

Rick: We have s_ome mutual friends. I
heard about the opening, bought an
album, learned five songs I had never

‘ heard before, went down, and auditi-

oned. Next thing I knew, I was a
southern rocker. ‘ . .
SHOWCASE: Do you write for the
Outlaws?

Rick: Yes, I do. I wrote both the songs
I sing lead on for the new album,
"Easy Does It’_' and "Won’t Come Out
Of The Rain." A friend of mine and -I
collaborated, as we've done since we
had our own band back home.
SHOWCASE: What do you enjoy

K doing in your free time?

Rick: I write songs. I spend a lot of
time with my family, I've got a wife
and two daughters, seven and eleven

ake an album. Not because we don't

. get. along, but because we're spread

out. Hughie (Thomasson, guitarist-
lvocalist) lives in Tampa, David (Dix,
drummer), in Atlanta, Freddie, in
Akron, Ohio, and myself in Syracuse.
It's impossible to call up the guys and
say "Hey, let's all go to ‘Chicago and
party this weekend."

SHOWCASE: Earlier, you menti-
oned your solo album, what's hap-
pening with the others as far as solo
careers go? _

Rick: Well, Freddie has just finished
his. He had good people working with
him; as a matter of fact, the drummer
onyhis disc was Myron Grombacher
from (Pat)? Benatarfs band. Hughie-is
going into the studio after this tour to
do his solo album. But, everyone's

first love is the Outlaws. We really ‘ I

feelthe band is about to blossom; we
feel strong about the new album.

SHOWCASE: What's the new album

I titled?

Rick: Los Hombres Malo——"The Bad"
Guys." _

SHOWCASE: Do you. figure the
record company will use that for
promotion?

Rick: Yeah, I guess so. Sometimes it
worries me though, 'cause we're not
really. We are "BAD" as players, but
we are not bad guys‘.

SHOWCASE: Where did you put the
album together?

Rick: We rehearsed in Tampa, did th -

. the overdubs and mixed in Chicago.
‘SHOWCASE: Who produced the

A album?

Rick: Gary Lyons. He's the same pro-
ducer from the Ghost Riders album.
SHOWCASE: It couldn't help be
noticed that original member Billy
Jones was absent from tonight's per-
formance, where is he?

Rick: Billy is no longer with the band,

-he left just prior to the new album.

SHOWCASE: So you did the album
as a quartet?

Rick: Yes, it was just the four of us.
SHOWCASE: Did Billy leave because
of a fall-out? ‘
Rick: No, it was by mutual agree-

* ,‘ ment. The band's been changing a lit— 

   
 

        
  
      
 
 
   

tle bit; I'm sure Billy...we still keep in
touch. He's pursuing a solo career, or
else he's going to form another band,
so he's doing fine. And we're happy
with the change.

There was a knock at the door and in
walked drummer David Dix and guitarist-
/vocalist Hughie Thomasson. Dix seemed at

I ease, but H ughie seemed slightly nervous——he

fiddled with a copy of Ghost Riders sitting
on the dressing counter. After introductions,
we got back to the interview. I

’ SHOWCASE: How do feel about the

band changes?
Hughie: I feel good about it; you've
got to be able to change. Ifyou can't,
you're not gonna survive, and that is
one thing this band has been able to
do all along. It's either bend or break,
and we like playing so much that,
even though the b'and,.has had a‘ lot of
changes, we've been able to stay
around for a lot of years. Not everyb-
ody wants to do the same thing

forever. The change doesn't bother.

us. I think we sound as good now as
we ever have.

David: Probably better. Let's put it I.

this way, no change we've ever made

. has turned out be bad.

SHOWCASE: Do you ever look back
on any of the changes?

Hughie: No you can't, you have to
think positively. If you make the
change, you've got to keep your shit
together and take the criticism and
then dish it out to show 'em your
change was for the better. We've
been lucky so far.

SHOWCASE: The fans of the Out-

laws have noticed a progression in

  
  
 
 
   
  

 

the band's music from southern boo-I

T‘ V... 4  ' gie to a harder rocking bracket. What
basic tracks in Atlanta, and fi.nished

are your feelings on this?

Rick: Well, I feel we're more contem-
porary. We keep up with the times,
and there aren't as many southern
boys in theband as there used to be.
Also, the influences that ‘Freddie
Salem has———this is his fifth album you
know—and my influences from New
York are out of the country-ish vein.
We still retain that southern flavor
because it's the Outlaws’ roots. We
want to be able to reflect on the
members of the band without aban-
doning those roots. \ ’
SHOWCASE: How do you two feel
about losing the southern touch? ‘
Hughie: It doesn't bother me a bit.
We've retained the southern influ-

ence. lt shows up...

Hughie:~ But we're not going to be

SHOWCASE: How do you feel about
going back to smallerdates such as
colleges? I

Rick: Fine, I wouldn't mind goifﬁs

back to clubs, as long as we could still
do the arenas. As long as the people
are loving it, ‘I love it.

SHOWCASE: Do you get much from
the fans? ’

David: Yeah, when they're up it's a
natural pick-me—up‘for us. Makes you

mind if they're sitting down; because,
when they're sititir-ig"down, atleast
they're listening. There is a lot to

David: Yeah, by that time you're sick
