Vandalism
increasing
in Union

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The William Pitt Union’s sixth
ﬂoor lounge and men’s restroom
were found covered with graffiti
Sunday night, adding to the
growing problem of vandalism in
the WPU.

Black marker was used to
write several words and symbols,
possibly gang-related, on furni-
ture in the sixth ﬂoor lounge and
a mirror in the men’s rest room.

“There have been a lot of
problems lately with people writ-
ing with markers in rest rooms
and all over the furniture,” said
Chris Weinstein, Facilities
Manager of WPU.

The word “crip,” a nationally
known gang which is believed to
have members in Pittsburgh, was
written on one of the lounge end
tables. “Troy Rest In Peace” was
also written on lounge furniture
and just the word “Troy,” was
written in rest room.

“The heavy black magic mark-
er looks like it may be gang graf-
fiti,” WPU Building Manager
Chris Chergi said. “It matches
graffiti we’ve found before on
lower levels.”

According to Chergi, WPU has
had other vandalism problems
within the past month, including
baby powder poured in the
men’s rest rooms on the fifth,
sixth and seventh ﬂoors.

“There has been a rash of peo-

The “joyful” holiday season is underway,
shopping malls are ﬁlling up with people
buying gifts and snow will soon be falling.
But for people with seasonal effective dis-
order the holiday season can be a time of
sadness.

Seasonal effective disorder is a type of ,

depression that occurs during the winter
months. According to the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center News Bureau,

this disorder is not a simple case of the hol-
iday blues. Seasonal effectivedisorder
occurs as the winter days grow shorter and
lasts until springtime when the days grow
longer again. This cycle can last for years.

Dr. Mark Miller, a specialist in depression
at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, said, “Seasonal effective disorder is
a compilation of symptoms that are usually
comprised of a low mood, oversleeping,
overeating and weight gain.” ,

Miller added, “The disorder might possi-
bly affect 10 percent of the population, and

the more northern you are [located] the
higher your chances are of being affected.”

He stressed the importance of correctly
diagnosing seasonal effective disorder.

“We think it’s a seasonal component to a
depressive disorder and it is important to
get properly diagnosed and treated,” said
Miller

treatment at its depression prevention clin-
ic. Anyone who would like to speak to a
doctor or get information should call 624-

Stadent allocations process serves as role model to others

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

(Editor's note: This is the first in a two-
part series looking into the Student
Government Board is Allocation process.)

Pitt’s student-run allocations board is
the only one of its kind in the country.
“You don’t see anything like this any-
where else,” according to Student
Government Board Allocations Chair
Damian Cevallos.

Although throughout the past year
people have questioned the process of
allocating student funds, SGB members

and administrators stand behind the cur-
rent system. -

“I’m hoping we can be a role model
for other campuses who want to start a
similar system,” Cevallos said.

SGB board member Tara Munkatchy
saw how other universities administrate
student funds at a student government
conference last summer at Texas A&M.
She said Pitt’s allocations method gar-
nered much interest from other schools
with less—efﬁcient systems.

“We learned that other student govern-
ments were having a lot of problems,”
Munkatchy said.

“Many [others] had University Senates

in charge of administrating money 
there were more people involved and
more conﬂicts.”

Munkatchy said several other universi-
ties talked to her and SGB President
Jacob Brody and asked for advice on
how to start systems similar to Pitt’s.

“We had the most effective method of
doling out money of anyone at the con-
ference,” she said.

Cevallos said the original student allo-
cations proposal, drafted in April 1975,
was much broader and less specific than
today’s, although its purpose was gener-
ally the same.

“What you see now is more focused

and more designed on the purpose to
help students as best as they can,” he
said. “Though what [the people who
proposed it] wanted was basically what
we’re doing today.”

According to Cevallos, the fact that the
process is student-run does not make it
any less effective.

“It gets really frustrating for me when
people say the Allocations Committee
sucks, and it should go back to letting
adults handle it,” he said.

“Some people might see a problem
with it, but they should look and see
what kind of a system it really is,” he

In an age of environmental
awareness, industrialized com-
panies are continuing to discov-
er more effective ways to burn
materials which will minimize
harm to the atmosphere.

In a current debate among
local environmental activists and
the Kosmos Cement company
located on Neville Island, about
10 miles from the University of
Pittsburgh, the Allegheny
Department of Health has
allowed the Kosmos company
to conduct a 55-day test burn of
tires as an effective_or ineffective
way of fueling its plant to make
cement. ‘

Cicilia Schmidt of the Clean
Water Action Project said the
greatest concern is the water
facility, located only 100 feet
from the plant. This reservoir
contains treated water for about

250,000 people in McKees’
Rocks,

Bellevue, Avalon,

Sewickley and Brighton Heights.
If the permit is granted, the West
View Water Authority will have
to pay $1 million to cover the
reservoir which will keep the
water free from toxins.

This concern does not come
from burning the tires, but from
the method that will be used.
The Kosmos company plans to
burn the tires whole as opposed
to shredded.

Kevin Paveglio, Kosmos plant
manager, said that this method
has been proven effective.
“European countries have been
doing it for years” and over 30
cement kilns are currently using
this process in the United States,
he said. Burning the tires whole
actually saves money in electri-
cal energy because the tires
burn more rapidly and the oxy-
gen and heat can be better con-
trolled, he said.

Janet Staholsky of the Ohio
River Basin Environmental
Council said, “There’s a right

way and wrong way [to do the

burning]. They are going to take
the cheapest way to do it.”

Schmidt said that by burning
the tires whole, the heavy metals
that are contained in the radials
of the tires remain. The,by—prod-
ucts of the tires are hazardous.
“The metal will be vaporized
and escape through the stacks,”
she said. “This causes a problem
in airborne mercury.” She also
added that the increased lead
and arsenic falls into the water
which contains carcinogenic
material and could cause birth
defects.

Schmidt said burning chipped
tires is much more effective and
environmentally safe. It is also
recognized in the industry as the
most effective way to do it. The
chipped tires become more
homogeneous when they mix
with coal.

Guillermo Cole, spokesperson
for the Allegheny County Health
Department, said burning the
tires whole is “not an unproven
technology and is not the first of

=‘~  ‘PnT*NEws;‘Tue'sday;-‘1)"éeéii1‘B€' ‘7; 'i9"9'3

Testburning of tires for energy-cause"is debate

‘its kind. We do have data that

says it can done safely without
degrading air quality.”

Another problem, said
Schmidt, is that by burning the
tires in this inefficient manner,
there arises a problem of dust.
Schmidt said Kosmos has always
had this problem with dust. “For
a company that can’t control
dust, it’s unconscionable that
they are deemed a 55-day test
bum, especially since there is an
open drinking facility near by,”
said Schmidt.

Strahosky, an Avalon resi-
dent, said she does not feel
secure about this test being con-
ducted in‘her backyard. “This
[air pollution] facility is over 30
years old,” she said. “It’s a
cement kiln, not a tire incinera-
tor.”

_ “We think the burning of tires
will not have an adverse impact
on air quality,” said Cole. “There
might even be a reduction in
certain -types of emissions up to
20 percent.”

seasonal
trips, gives
students
break from
final tests

Staff Writer

As the holidays fast
approach, so do finals. '
Students can be found
working round the clock
to ﬁnish papers and pre-
pare for exams. It doesn’t
seem like there is a lot of
time for students to take a
break and enjoy the sea-
son’s festivities in
Pittsburgh. ,

But 36'students will be
able to do just that next
weekend. The Pitt
Program Council sells
tickets to the Nutcmcker
every year. This year they
sold 56 tickets to Sundays
2 p.1n. ballet performed in
downtown Pittsburgh.

The Nutcracker runs
from Dec. 9 through Dec.
28 but “the only time stu-
dents can really go is on
the 12th because finals
start on the 13th, then stu-
dents go home for the
holidays,” Assistant
Director of Student
Activities Tom Misuraca
said.

PPC does not provide
transportation to the
show, “we just sell the
tickets,” Misuraca said.
“It’s a big seller; we were
sold out with just one day
of advertising.” He said
they could sell more, but
there weren’t any more

Students honored for service contributions“

Byjohn B. Moore
For The Pitt News

In the dimly-lit ballroom of
the William Pitt Union, mirrored
tiles on the walls reflect the
smiles of students and their
tutors stepping forward in
recognition of their accomplish-
ments.

Yesterday afternoon, partici-
pants of the Pitt Project Tutor
program were honored at a
small yet important ceremony
that included both the tutors
and their students.

Through the Pitt Project Tutor
program, students at the
University of Pittsburgh are
assigned one or two students
from three participating schools
in Hazelwood and are required
to meet with the students twice
a week.

“There were a lot of University
students interested in communi-
ty service, and there were a lot
of students in Hazelwood that
were available for the tutors,”
Tutor Coordinator ‘Laura Horn
said. The Hazelwood students
were chosen from St. Stephen
School, Burgwin Elementary
and Gladstone Middle School.

“The schools selected kids on
their own criteria,” said Horn.
“We wanted kids who could
really benefit , who could get
the most out of [the programl.”

Horn said the schools weren’t
just looking for the students
with the lowest grades in every
class, but were looking for

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

We interupt this page
to bring you this
important announcement

those that had the promise to
do more.

The job of the tutor was not
only to help with literacy skills
and math and science problems,
but to emphasize goal setting.
Each tutor would try to get the
student to set at least one goal a
week.

Horn also stressed the rela-
tionships that grow out of the
meetings between student and
tutor. “The program hopes for

more than just an interaction’

over spelling,” she said. “We
hope the tutors are seen as
older brothers or sisters to the
students.”

Pittsburgh City Councilman

Bob O’Connor, present at the
recognition ceremony, was
influential in getting the pro-
gram started. “If we’re going to
stop the problems in this city,
we have to start with educa-
tion,” he said. ‘

O’Connor said that there is an
untapped potential in the stu-
dents at the university that
many seem to overlook. There
is no money involved with this
projecf, and the students can
provide a much needed service.

"According to O’Connor,
“Education is a long range
answer to our problems, that
and the economy.-”

Addressing the students at the

"3

ceremony, Dr. Shirley Biggs,
director of the Pitt Project Tutor
said, “\Y/'e’re here because a lot
of people did a lot of hard
work. We wanted to give you
something for your hard work
and look forward to the day you
can be the tutor.”

The benefits come not only
from the students that were
tutored but from the tutors as
well. Maureen Dalton, a tutor at
St. Stephen School said, “It’s a
great opportunity. Any kind of
community service is good, but
this is especially good because
you can see your effect on the

' child and you can see the bene-

Allocations

added. _

SGB’s Allocations Committee
supervises the money spentby
107 student organizations and
governance groups on pro-
grams, activities and other oper-
ational costs.

According to Cevallos, stu-
dent groups are funded through
the $32 per semester student
activities fee paid by all non-
CGS unglergraduates. SGB allo-
cations’receives 50 percent of
the revenue from the fee, with
the remaining '50 percent going
to WPTS and the Pitt Program
Council.

The 1993-94 Allocations
Committee funding report,
which is approved by Pitt
Director of Student Activities
Joseph Cavalla and Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Harmon, lists the total
funding for the current fiscal
year as $355,186.07.

According to the report,
approximately 56.6 percent of
this total ($188,262.98) is allo-
cated to SGB and Pitt’s gover-
nance groups, which include

Black Action Society, Resident

Engineering Student Council
and Academy of Students of

The remaining $146,923.09 is
shared by the 107 student orga-
nizations eligible for SGB allo-
cations. '

After budgets are approved
and finalized, remaining money
from the student activities fee
goes into -a general distribution

fund, from which organizations’

emergency funds requests are
taken.

These emergency requests
can range from display ads in
The Pitt News, to van rentals for
student groups, to mass printing
through the university’s Central
Printing office.

According to Cevallos, there
is usually enough money to
cover the emergency requests.
“Once I notice that our general
distribution level is getting low,
it’s usually December or late in
the semester anyway,” he said.

The committee is comprised
of eight voting members and
two alternates.

After three members left the
committee, this year’s members
include Heath Golden, Julie
Crowell, Rob Mazur, Eric
McKinley, Hannah Ufberg and
Elizabeth Mania. Cevallos had
been a member and became
chair in May. Golden, Crowell,
McKinley and Mania will contin-
ue their SGB participation next
term serving as elected board
members.Members serve terms
from January thru December
while‘ the Chair of the
Committee serves from May to
April of the following year.

to serve as a liaison to several
student organizations.

When groups submit
requests, their assigned liaisons
investigate it and discuss the
requests during the weekly
meetings.

Cevallos said constant coin-
munication between the com-
mittee and the student groups,
which receive funding, is
absolutely necessary.

“I want to make sure that we
contact the organizations every
two weeks or so,” he said.
""\X7l1en we do business, I want
them to do a lot of investigation
into it. ’

“If you have the right people
on the committee then, as chair,
you can accomplish a lot,” he
added.

Cevallos said he is working
toward getting the entire com-
mittee to take a more active role
in contacting student organiza-
tions. . -

He said much of the commit-
tee’s work in the past was done

by Chairpersons themselves,

such as last year’s Allocations
chair, Lisa Waslo. '

“Lisa did a great job but she
did a lot of the work herself,
and as a result we really weren’t
as informed as we should be.”

According to Cevallos, viola-
tions of allocations procedures
do not occur frequently, since
the groups in question also
have to deal with the Office 0
Student Activities. '

“It’s' difficult for a group to
violate the process, and it’s hard
to cheat the system,” Cevallos,
said.

Cevallos said deficits are his-
torically one of the few prob-

j

lems with allocating funds,
although he said he cannot
point to a concrete example of
one.

Although deficits must be
covered by non-allocated
money, he said the committee
tries to be fair with groups that
incur them.

Cevallos said the biggest
problem with deficits are
groups which spend their own
money and then expect to
receive reimbursements

“If a deficit happens, we don’t
say, ‘You screwed up. Get out
of here,”’ Cevallos said. “I try to
be as ﬂexible as possible. I’d
rather help the groups out than
try to be a bad-ass about
things.”

According to the SGB
Allocations Manual, programs
are funded under the following
priorities: educational, service
programs, cultural, recreational
and social activities. Requests
can be approved, denied or
deferred by SGB when they
receive Allocations’ recommen-
dation.

“We look first at whether the
program has been funded
before,” Cevallos said.

“As far as new requests, we
look at how many people it will
educate, how big the group
[submitting the request] is and
the monetarylvalue involved,”
he said. if

Emergency requests are
deferred requests and are sub-
mitted after the annual budget is
approved. Any emergency
requests in excess of $500 must

be approved by vote of a quo-

rum of SGB members. _
Cevallos said this procedure is
also followed during the sum-

mer when much of the SGB is
out of town.

“Every request that comes in
is pretty much set within the
standards. So if it was a minimal
amount, I would just sign it,”
Cevallos said.

An example of these small
emergency requests was an'S8
request for copies for recruit-
ment ﬂyers.

“The second anything contro-
versial came up, I’d call the
members and make sure I at
least got a quorum.”

According to Cevallos, Board
Member and Business Manager
Tony Moody, who was SGB’s
acting president over the sum-
mer, approved requests in
excess of $500, such as a

. $2157.24 for display ads in The

Pitt News for SGB recruitment.

Cevallos said .the Allocations
Committee can defer requests
that cannot be approved but
should not be turned down
immediately.

“If a request isn’t too clear-
cut, we can defer it,” Cevallos
said.

“That’s a great way for us to
see if they’re really serious.
They can come back to us, and
from there we can revise it.”

“Sometimes we really want to
fund certain things, but we have

to make sure we’re being fair to .
all the groups,” he added. “If-

someone wants to take their
group to Hawaii, it’s obviously
too expensive.”

Though Hawaii might be out
of the question, it could soon be
easier to fund some student
programs which may have been
declined in the past.

Last month, SGB passed a res-
olution which proposed a $8

per term increase in non-CGS
undergraduates’ Student
Activities Fee.

If the fee increase is passed
by Pitt’s Office of Student
Activities and Board of Trustees,
SGB’s estimated annual budget
will increase by 25 percent to
approximately $500,000.

Cevallos said the additional
money would come in handy
immediately, since over 30 new
student organizations have
begun receiving SGB allocations
since the activities fee last
increased in 1987.

“A lot of students can start
their own groups, and I think
that’s really great,” he said.

“The fact is, when you only
have so much money it makes it
hard.” A

Cevallos added, “the reason
[for the increase] is not because
SGB is asking for more money.
We have to either squeeze
money from other organiza-
tions, or we increase the fee so
more money is available.”

Pitt Associate Director of
Student Activities Terence
Milani said he agreed that the
fee increase is coming at the
right time, since over the past
few years, the value of money
has decreased while the
demand for funding by student

Milani also said organizations
will be able to take advantage
of the additional activities rev-
enue immediately.

“T he money students give to
activities fees comes directly
around to the students  it
directly benefits students that
will be using it,” Milani said.
“The money will be directly uti-
lized for students by students.
It’s money well spent."

“I think the people, who
believe there is a need for a

to become more knowledge-
able of how the system works,”
Milani said. “It’s been working

period of several years, and I
think it’s been fine-tuned.”

Prepare students for the world

A panel headed by former Senator William Brock
released a report yesterday calling for colleges to
reassess the way they operate. They said that colleges
should prepare their students more adequately for
their roles in society. USA Today reports that the
panel based their recommendations on a 1992
Department of Education survey of college transcripts.
They found that 50.8 percent of students graduated

'~ without ever studying mathematics, 26.2 without ever

studying history and 58.4 without ever studying a for-
eign language. This report reveals a problem that both
students and administration officials need to address.
Far too often, getting a degree has not prepared stu-
dents for the real world. j V A 0 7

The panel was set up by the Wingspread Group.
They recommended that colleges and universities
develop plans to give students a broad liberal arts edu-
cation and make sure that next year’s new students
will “graduate as individuals of character, more sensi-

’ tive to the needs of the community  andmorecivil

in habits of thought, speech, and action,” (Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette). These recommendations should be
acted upon so universities do not become degree
stores which sell diplomas to anyone willing to hang
‘around for four years. ’
Requirements for graduation should be made stricter.
While entrance requirements should be kept at the
same level, those students-who were content to just
get by in high school, should realize a higher quality
of work is expected from them once they enter col-
lege. College must be used as a place to prepare them
realistically for life after they get their degree.

Too many students want to have things handed to’
' tioned. in-.South_. Korea, but

2.-them as opposed to working for their just desserts. '

Statistics don ’t end crime T

Th‘_e,F.B.I. has reported that violent crimedropped
five perc.ent in the first six months of 1993, but
Director Louis Freech warns the U.S. to take this news
with caution: "the levels of violent crime and drug traf-
ficking remain so staggering,” (USA Today ).Students
should not be lulled into a false sense of security from
these headlines. Instead of being soothed by this good
news, it is time for everyone. to take steps to ensure
that crime rates keep dropping.

Students should learn how to protect themselves by
attending safety seminars on campus and taking a self-
defense course. During finals week many students will
be out late doing research or studying. Those students
should use the shuttle system when they are out“late.
The shuttles are there for your convenience and safety.

As the campus shuts down for break, those who are
leaving should make sure theirvaluables will be safe.
Those who plan to stay on campus, should be sure to
be extra cautious. _

Use firm hand to deal with Korea

Because of North Korea’s
continued refusal to allow the
International Atomic ' Energy
Agency to inspect all of its
nuclear facilities (they still will
not agree to an inspection of
the reactor in Yongbyon), a
showdown with the rest of the
world may soon be on the
horizon.

Currently the U.S. has about
37,000 military personnel sta-

may, and should, soon deploy
more soldiers to the
Demilitarized Zone. This will
be done in hopes of deterring
a North Korean invasion of the
South. '

President Clinton still hopes
that diplomacy, promises of
recognition and trade will
cause North Korea to back
down and open its facilities up
to inspection. '

It sounds like a decent strat-
egy when one considers that
North Korea’s economy has
contracted over the past‘ two
years and will almost certainly
do the same this year. That is
until one looks inside North
Koreaand realizes that all bets
are off when dealing with this
country.

North Korea is a nation
where time "stands still and has
been ruled by one man, Kim Il

Sung, since 1948. Today the '

81-year-old Kim is still the
paramount leader although his
son and heir apparent, Kim
Jong I1, is the de facto ruler
who is in charge of the military
and the day-to-day running of
the country. ‘

The elder Kim makes all of
North Korea’s foreign policy
decisions. Some have called
North Korea the Hermit
Kingdom or the last hard-line
Stalinist nation on earth.
Whatever name one chooses to

use, one thing is for certain —
North Korea is the personal
kingdom of Kim Il Sung, and
he is god to the 22 million peo-
ple who le there.

Personality cult is not
strong enough to describe how
the citizens feel about Kim Il
Sung. Huge bronze statues and
painted murals of the “Great
Leader” are everywhere. All cit-
izens are required to wear a

Tony
Dickensheets

badge of Kim Il Sung over their
hearts to show their devotion
to the quasi—religious leader.

In George Orwell’s 1984, he
describes a nation that is ruled
by a “Big Brother” and an Elite
Class. He says that, “the Party
seeks power entirely for its
own sake. Power is not a
means; it is an end. If you want
a picture of the future, imagine
a boot stamping on a human
face —_—— forever.”

So it is still in the North
Korea of the 1990s. According
to a North Korean terrorist,
much of the education that
children receive is focused on
the worship of Kim Il Sung.
The first phrase‘that children

learn is “Thank you, Dear‘

Leader.” She also said that
“Kim Il- Sung is a godlike figure
.. in North Korea, and to
refuse an order from him is
unthinkable.” In North Korea,
she said, “virtually everyone is

a slave to Kim Il Sung. It was,

the most ultimate honor to die
for Kim'Il Sung. Everyone
thinks like that,”
Washington Post 11/ 30/ 93). '

(The A

The average North Korean
citizen knows little or nothing
about the outside world as
their radios and televisions are
government controlled and are
fixed exclusively to several
propaganda stations. Short-
wave radios are found only
among the few elite.

Thus, the population is unaf-
fected by the collapse of com-
munism in Eastern Europe and
the_ former Soviet Union. Kim Il
Sung and Kim Jung Il, howev-
er, are very much aware of
those events and will do any-

. thing to prevent the’ same fate

from happening in their king.-
dom.

The North Korean military is
the fifth largest in theworld
with over one million soldiers
and an arsenal of missiles with
a range of 1,000 kilometers. It
is clear that the international
community cannot allow No_rth
Korea to develop nuclear
weapons.

It is still possible that diplo-
macy will work to solve this
crisis, but the Clinton
Administration must carry a
heavy stick (i.e., sanctions and
beefed-up military and the

I addition of nuclear weapons in

South Korea) in addition to
offering some carrots.

Clinton must stop waffling
and come to grips with the fact
that this is a potentially explo-
sive situation involving, not
only the U.S. and North Korea,
but also Russia, China and East
Asia.

How this crisis ends is large-
ly Kim Il Sung’s decision, but
the U.S. must be prepared for
any possible outcome. It can
be no other way when one is
dealing with the last Stalinist
nation on earth. 9

Let the voice ring out...

I know what you’re thinking. SGB
elections have been over and decided,
rather magnanimously, I might add, for
more than 10 days now. And yet, the
so-called controversy surrounding presi-
dent-elect Ross Pasquale and his alleged
elections violations rages on. Or so
we’re told.

The only parties that seem to care
about this affair are The Pitt News and
certain members of the outgoing SGB:
President Jacob and the 1
members of the present
board who lost their
bids for next year’s
presidency.

Now, do you think
it’s possible that the
losers are just a little

candidates that somehow didn’t find
their way to the front page.

1. Tara Munkatchy - What a coincidence
it was that the two pollsters who turned
Ross in for his alleged violations at
Sutherland Hall were two of your soror-
ity sisters. Besides which, what do you
care? You came in a distant third. If
Ross isn’t the president, then Tony
Moody is.

2. Tony Moody - What
did you run on? Your
membership in a slew
of campus organiza-
tions? Posters, flyers,
and being Greek got
you second place.
Count your blessings.

sore about their respec-
tive defeats at the hands of an SGB
member from two years ago? Someone
who few people gave a chance in hell
of winning and who pulled it off with
an outstanding campaign? The only can-

‘ didate for president with a clear vision

for the SGB over the next year?

That’s right, kiddies. Ross kicked
some serious butt, and before he won,
none of these folks took him seriously.
But now that he’s won quite decisively,
there are a lot of sour grapes surfacing.
I don’t begin to know what the editors
of the newspaper have against Ross, so
I’ll leave that issue to the imagination.

However, I think it’s rather clear that
Tony Moody and Tara Munkatchy are
just plain bitter. That’s right, guys. The
Greek vote wasn’t enough this year,
and apparently, neither was the female
vote that one of those candidates might
have been counting on (along with her
glowing endorsement from the paper).

Moving right along. Jacob, you’re just
a big joke. Your quotes in the paper in
response to this whole ordeal have
been nothing short of hysterical. No, I
mean it, Jake. They’ve beenlreally
funny. I laughed. I laughed hard. You
say that if you had faced such a contro-
versy during your presidency, then you
would have resigned from your office.
With all due respect, I find that very
hard to believe, and so do the rest of
your humble constituents.

You’ve faced bigger controversies
than this by far during your term, both
public and private. Unfortunately, they
didn’t all make it to the front page like
the one Ross has had to deal with. I
know you don’t like Ross, and that’s
fine, but just keep your big mouth shut.
Fortunately for all of us, your term is on
the verge of expiring (although we’ll
always have the gazebo and the big
clock to remember you). A

Now, I’d like to take this opportunity
to point out a few things that not every-
one might be aware of about the other

3. Doug Herman -‘Dude, you lost. You
lost big time. And not even one of your
four cronies made it onto the board.
What position exactly are you in to
judge the ethics of someone else?

4. Heath Golden (can I call you Heath?)
- Heath, Heath, Heath. Early in the cam-
paign, you complained about ticket vio-
lations committed by the “Equal choice
for equal voice” ticket. Next there’s an
ad in the paper endorsing you for
board, paid for by the Dental Science
Club. Now, you never really officially
got that endorsement, though the presi-
dent of the club is a fraternity brother of
yours. I’ve been told that you, not the
club, paid for that ad. You were also
seen during the campaign ripping down
posters that had been hung by some of
the other candidates for board. With big
brothers and role models like Mike and
Gill, I can’t believe you would stoop to
such behavior. ~

Many of the candidates have openly
admitted to breaking the same viola-
tions that Ross was accused of by Tara’s
friends, except those, who have already
been mentioned. The student body
elected its president. If the election is
held again, he will win again, perhaps
this time by a wider margin after all of
this hullabaloo about nothing.

Let’s move on with our lives and give
this new, rather promising board a
chance to do what they came to do and
what we elected them to do.
Congratulations from little ole’ me to
the new SGB president and board.

I look forward to seeing your accom-
plishments over the next semester
before I leave. A special nod to Julie
Crowell, Eric McKinley, Andrew
Wuertele, and, of course, Ross Pasquale
for helping an old timer believe again,
if only for a moment. Equal choice for
equal voice. Amen.

POINT

...or a Moody Government?

There has been a significant amount
of campus discourse revolving around
Student Government Board President-
elect Ross Pasquale’s controversial vic-
tory on November 17 in the 1994
Student Government elections. It was
alleged by two poll workers that Mr.
Pasquale actively campaigned on elec-
tion day within 100 feet of the
Sutherland Hall polling site, thus wrong-
ly gathering additional votes for his can-
didacy.

ly.

Many may gripe when they read this
column and say it is just a personal
attack on Ross Pasquale. Wrong. If it

had been any other person in Mr. .

Pasquale’s shoes the principle would be
exactly the same.

The punishment handed down is an
insult to the intelligence of Pitt students
and is just the final blow to a terminally
ill student governance system. It first

started with the reim-

The problem lies in
the fact that this act is
deemed illegal and

tion in the Student
Government Board
Elections Code. When,

bursement of Student
_ Government Board
President’s tuition and
fees under the auspices
of President Gil A.
Golden in 1992. _
Then it was the contro-

the complaints were
filed to the Elections Chairperson, the
committee began taking the steps nec-
essary to adjudicate this problem. A
hearing was held and the committee, by
majority vote, concluded that Mr.
Pasquale was indeed guilty of the
charge against him.

However, the committee did not fulfill
its responsibilities after all. The punish-
ment for this infraction was 1) Mr.
Pasquale had to give a public apology
for his wrongdoing and 2) the disquali-
fication of only the votes Mr Pasquale
received at the polling site in question,
in this case Sutherland Hall. The dis-
qualification of these votes, unfortunate-
ly, does not alter the outcome of the
election

What does this tell the roughly 14,000
undergraduate students who will be
represented by not only Mr. Pasquale,
but also by the eight candidates elected
to the 1994 Student Government Board?
It tells them what they should already
know.

The student governance system at the
University of Pittsburgh is continuously
losing any legitimacy it might have. It
tells them they have a" representative
process which condones the act of
cheating. Yes, cheating.

As a former member of the 1992
Board I am not attempting to paint
every board member and president in
the past as free of any wrongdoing. I
don’t know for sure, but one would be
hard pressed to convince me that all
students for elected office are complete-
ly free of any wrongdoing. This is not a
ho1ier—than-thou diatribe here.

But there is a difference between
breaking the rules and breaking the
rules and getting caught.

In this case we not only have a
President-elect who has been deemed
by an objective committee of his peers
as guilty of this wrongdoing, but Mr.
Pasquale admits himself that he broke
the rules, that he acquired votes illegal-

versy over current
Board President H. Jacob Brody’s
expenses at the retreat for the current
Board and its committees at the
Nemecolin Woodlands in January. If
things stand as they are, Ross Pasquale’s
election fraud will be known as the
instance which stripped our governance
system of what little respect and cre-
dence it had left.

If Ross is inaugurated with the rest of
the new Board in January he will com-
mand absolutely no respect from stu-
dent leaders and organizations, and his
ability to fulfill all the duties of his
office will be severely impeded.
Administrator X would and should have
reservations about working with a stu-
dent representative such as Mr.
Pasquale.

The Pitt News editorial board opinion
on the subject was published in the
November 22 edition saying that a new
election should be held for the student
body to choose someone other than Mr.
Pasquale, a student with high moral
fiber, to take on the duties of this high-
est elected student position.

There isn’t time for that with next
term just around the corner and a full
agenda of concerns to be addressed by
the incoming Board and its president.

This lack of legitimacy has to be
reversed now. Mr. Pasquale must show
he is a man of high character and
should step down from his position.
Tony Moody, the runner—up in the pres-
idential race, should be called upon to
fulfill the duties of the office for which
he is qualified and sought. Moody is
one who ran a fair race.

This is not only a pro—Moody stance,
but as the controversy stands now is the
right thing to do. It is what must be
done in order for us to once again
respect and deem legitimate a process
which was created and is administered
by our fellow students.

The Redmen (2-1) are coming off an impressive 72-64
win over Seton Hall.

“It was a huge win for us,” coach Brian Mahoney
said. “Any time you beat a quality team like Seton Hall,
it boosts your confidence.” '

The Panthers are also riding an emotional high after
playing their best game of the season in defeating
Providence 94-82.

“Pittsburgh is playing very well,” Mahoney said.
“They have a lot of weapons.”

“Mobley, Antigua, and McCullough are all New York
guys,” he said. “I know what they can do — they’re
great players that can hurt you in a number of ways.”

The player that Mahoney is most concerned with is
Jerry McCullough.

The junior point guard had a huge game versus
Providence — 19 points, 10 assists and six boards.

“McCullough is a problem,” Mahoney said. “It’s

(First of a two-part series on rebuilding
the Pitt football program.)

Tucked away on the window sill in John
Majors’ office is a plaque resting against a
pane of glass that reads:

1 shall not pass through this world but
once, Any good therefore that I can do or
any kindness that I can show, to any
human being, let me do it now, Let me not
defer or neglect it, For I shall not pass this
way again

Majors, however, has indeed passed this
way before. He recently completed the first
year of his second stint as head football
coach at the University of Pittsburgh, and
he is in the midst of a rebuilding task like
no other in his long career.

Pitt has the man it needs to shepherd the
ﬂock toward the promised land. ‘

“The most important thing is to hire
coach Majors and get his staff in place,
which we’ve already done,” athletic director
Oval Jaynes said.

Majors has done this sort of thing before.
He has built other programs from the
ground up. If he is to do it again, he will
have to corral the efforts of herds of people
that include: players, coaches, administra-
tors, recruits, boosters, season ticket-ho1d-
ers, media and even architects. Not neces-
sarily in that order either.

It is no small job.

Pitt sports a football program that has
won only 15 games over the last four years

and center Dickey Simpkins. _

The Panthers did more than hold their own as Cauley
and Mobley hauled down seven boards apiece to give
Pitt a 44-41 advantage on the glass.

“Pitt is a bigger, stronger team than we are,” Mahoney
said. “They are probably the most physical team in the

-league. We may have problems matching up.”

The Redmen are led by six-foot-eleven-inch, 255-
pound senior center Shawnelle Scott. Scott is averaging
23 points and 14 rebounds a game. No one else on the
team is in double digits. ‘

“Shawnelle is our most experienced player,”
Mahoney said. “We need him to score, rebound and
have a big year.” _ -

“This is a very important game for us,” he said. “It’s a
league game at home that we have to win.”

. It’s'also important for the Panthers, especially the
players from New York.

“It’s home, it’s tough to play there because you have
your friends and family in the stands,” McCullough said.
“You want to play well in front of them. We’re looking
for a Win.”

Pitt last won at St. John’s during the ‘88-’89 season
when the Panthers defeated the Redmen 85-81 in over-
time. -

“We’ve always been close up there, but we_ haven’t
played real well,” Evans said. “We have to get the New
York City kids to play within our system.”

If they play like they did Saturday, that won’t be a

_ problem.

Johrmy Majors has a long, successful track record of reviving dormant programs.

— an average of 3.7 wins per season. It is a
program that Majors, upon arrival at Pitt last
year, labeled in worse condition than when
he first took over, 20 years ago, with a team
coming off a 1-10 season.

Majors’ coaching record speaks for itself.
He has undertaken the rebuilding process
at his three previous stops (Iowa State, Pitt
and Tennessee).

Majors’ first head coaching job was at
Iowa State, a place he called a “coaches

...-----...-......_,t.r.....

graveyard.” In his first year, the Cyclones

suffered through a 3-7 season, but by the _

end of Majors’ fourth year the team held an
8-4 record. '

The job Majors did in his first stint here
at Pitt is legendary. In only four years, he
turned a one-win team into an undefeated
national champion. ‘ ‘

After the 1976 season, Majors left Pitt for
Tennessee, his alrna mater, where he faced
yet ‘another massive rebuilding project. The

58-year-old coach compiled 116 victories in
16 seasons, including 11 bowl appearances
in his last 12 years there.

So Majors has proved himself to have the.

savvy and experience needed to accom-
plish such an endeavor. But how has he
been able to rebuild time and again, and
what are his plans for this turn at Pitt? What
is Majors’ formula for building a winner
from a loser?

There were collisions. There
was a pile. _The referees waded
in, searching for the ball. The
entire game and one team’s sea-
son hinged on this play, and
nobody had made a call.

Anxious seconds passed until
an official ﬁnally raised an arm
pointing away from the end
ione. The 7-5 Pittsburgh
Steelers were saved — at least
for another week.

Three weeks ago, the Steelers
were being touted as the best
team in the AFC after pounding
the Buffalo Bills in front of a
national Monday Night Football
audience. Weeks earlier, some
fool who shall remain mesaid
they were Super Bowl con-
tenders. Two days ago a pat.het-
ic offense left Pittsburgh a few
inches from losing to_a 1-10
team on a six-game losing
streak. '

Something that had been con-
sidered a positive may be a rea-
son for the team’s struggles —
the return of Carlton Haselrig at
offensive guard.

Those problems run pretty

deep. If they had played a con-
tender on Sunday, the Steelers
would be 6-6 right now and in
serious jeopardy of. missing the
playoffs.

A good team would have
pounded Pittsburgh the way it
played on Sunday. Secondly, a
contender would have kicked
the tying field goal. As pathetic
as the Steelers’ offense had
been, the Patriots would have
had a great chance to win in
overtime, but Bill Parcells had
no reason to be conservative
with a 1-10 team.

That game is even more dis-
heartening for Pittsburgh after
consecutive poundings at the
hands of the Houston Oilers
and Denver Broncos.

The Steeler defense does not
deserve the Steel Curtain com-
parisons it got earlier this sea-
son, but it is not the problem.

‘Injuries have limited the effec-

tiveness of what was a thin front
seven, but the overall unit is
playing well enough to win
games.

The special teams are still a

concern, but they are not losing
games. Besides, where is the
Steeler offense if Gary Anderson
is not having a great season?
The Pittsburgh offense, how-
ever, has gone from erratic to
nonexistent the last few weeks.

Ryan
Buncher

Three things havedone that.

One is the absence of Barry
Foster. After Leroy Thompson
rolled through the Bills, the
biggest concern for the Steeler
running game was supposed to
be the fact that Leroy
Thompson is going to be a free
agent after the season.

Let us deal with this misun-
derstanding right now.
Thompson is a quality reserve
tailback. Barry Foster is an All-
Pro. Thompson not only lacks
Foster's bruising style that wears
down defenses, he is also not as

good at finding holes in the
defense — a must in the Steeler
attack.

Another problem is the play
of quarterback Neil O’Donnell.
Healthy or not, he is not getting
the ball down field right now. If
O’Donnell is hurting so badly
that he can not throw the deep
ball, Mike Tomczak should be
playing. If not, somebody might
want to suggest to Mr.
O’Donnell that he throw to the
wide-open teammates down-
ﬁeld.

The most disturbing problem
is the offensive line. That once-
dominating group has been
lousy the last few weeks, espe-
cially in pass protection. The
return of Carlton Haselrig may
be the reason why.

Haselrig deservedly went to
the Pro Bowl last season, and
his play this year is not the
whole problem. The mistake
was messing with a unit that
was clicking. The line was
opening holes and doing a
much better job in pass protec-
tion with Justin Strzelczyk start-

Haselrig's return marks Steelers’ recent slide

ing. That group, especially the
right side of Haselrig and Leon
Searcy has struggled since the
change.

More than any part of the
team, the offensive line has to
learn to work together as the
season rolls on. By reinserting
Haselrig into the lineup, the
Steelers interrupted that
process.

-Were the New Orleans
Saints really 5-0 this season, or
was that a mirage?

°The moaning about the lack
of quarterbacks continues, with
much of the blame falling on
run-oriented college schemes.
The other side of that is an ever-
growing number of quality run-
ning backs.

Jerome Bettis, Roosevelt
Potts, Ron Moore and Reggie
Brooks are the stars of a stellar
group of rookie running backs
this season. The inﬂux of run-
ners is even more impressive
with the bluest of blue chippers,
Garrison Hearst, missing most
of the season with injuries.

-The latest sign that there is
some justice in this world is this
week's Marcus Allen update. He
ran for 73 yards on 12 carries
and scored three touchdowns
(Allen now has 15 touchdowns
this season) Sunday against
Seattle. The Raiders’ would-be
replacement at tailback, Nick
Bell, has trouble making it to
the. huddle without pulling
something.

-How many of the people
who argue for West Virginia to
play in the Orange Bowl instead
of Florida State actually think
the Mountaineers are the better
team? Or that they could beat
the Seminoles?

Wrestling ta/ees 25179 at Las Vegas Invite

W/iltomger lone seeded Panther to place in prestigious competition

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

The bright neon lights of Las
Vegas didn’t shine too brightly
this past weekend for the Pitt
wrestling team.

The Panthers wrestled to a

25th place finish at the
prestigious Las Vegas
Invitational.

The luck that is so often asso-
ciated with one of America’s
most exciting cities unfortunate-
ly didn’t rub off on the Panthers
Saturday.

A 25th place finish is no dis-
grace, but the Panthers’ expec-
tations for Las Vegas were much
higher.

“We’re a little disappointed,
we didn’t do as good as we
expected,” Panthers’ head
wrestling coach Rande
Stottlemyer said.

Only one of the four seeded
wrestlers placed in their given
weight division.

“At times we went down
swinging and at other times we
didn’t go down swinging,”
Stottlemyer said. “

The Las Vegas Invitational is a
38—team competition with many
of the top wrestling programs in
the country fighting for top hon-
ors. In fact, 10 of the top 15
rated teams in the country were
represented in this single com-
petition.

“It’s a great competition,” Pitt
assistant coach Jim Beichner
said,   ..

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger
was the only Panther
(out of the four seeded) to place
in the competition, finishing
seventhﬂin his weight classifica-
tion.

The Pitt sophomore heavy-
weight lost on a controversial
stall call (avoiding action)
to _ the number—two
seeded Steve King, who went
on to win the heavyweight
division.)-"_ _

weights) and showed some
tremendous improvement
over last weekend (Lock Haven
Invitational),” Stottlemyer said.

Another pleasant surprise was
rookie John<Withrow. Wrestling
in the 158—pound division,
Withrow fought hard in defeat
in a match that could have
placed him in the top finalists of
his division.

“He’s always in the match,”
Stottlemyer said. “He never gets
blown out.” ,

An event as big as the Las
Vegas Invitational can serve as a
good motivating factor for those
Panthers who didn’t fare as
expected.

“They have to realize where
they have to go to get in the top
level of NCAA wrestling,”
Stottlemyer said.

Pitt’s top wrestler, senior Jeff
Kloiber, won his first two
matches but fell a little short in
his third match.

Kloiber, the number—three
seed in the 190—pound class,
lost 8-6 to the number-six seed,
JJ. Mc_Grew from Oklahoma
State.

Sophomore John Richey was
still feeling the results of an
elbow to the nose that he sus-
tained last weekend at Lock
Haven.

Wrestling with an uncomfort-
able full face guard, Richey
wrestled well in his early
matches but eventually ran
out of gas in the quarterfinals
and lost to_the eventual 134-
pound division vxiinner
Dewayne Zinkin from Fresno
State.

Number-five seed Rich

opening round match
against Keith Cunningham of
Central Oklahoma when he got
pinned. —

Jet lag, fear of first time
flying and injuries are all
factors that a traveling
sports team must deal with
at some time or another.

These are all factors that take
their toll on a young team but
must be overcome to achieve
success.

“We can’t look for excuses,
we have to look for solutions,”
Stottlemyer said.

A tough weekend such as the
one the Panthers endured last
weekend can serve as a good

learning experience.

The Panthers received first-
hand knowledge from some of
the top teams in the country
about what it takes to be a top
program.

“We have to do more, be
smarter and be more commit-
ted. The potential is there to
reach our goals,” Stottlemyer
said.

“Other teams have to deal
with travel and injuries as well
— it’s something that has to be
dealt with.”

Pitt’s first home match isn’t

1-3 Pitt 7906/eeg-}fz'g/0z‘sz‘o

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

With just six divisional
matchups awaiting the Pitt
Hockey Club for the remainder
of the season, the 1-3 Panthers
find themselves in a position
they never intended to be in.

With their backs to the wall,
they must find the discipline
they have been lacking and get
on the winning track in order to
keep their playoff hopes alive.
This past Saturday, the Panthers
tuned up against WPCHA
Division 11 Lock Haven, in
preparation for next week’s
showdown with divisional rival

Indiana (Pa.).

As expected, the stronger,
swifter Panthers took the Eagles
to school, allowing only 14
shots to fall on goaltender Sean
Moloney while peppering the
Lock Haven net with 62 shots in
a 12-2 drubbing.

Their victory over Lock
Haven, however, does not
improve their situation in the
playoff picture, and their 9-7
loss to Penn State West two
weeks ago — a game that the
Panthers gave away by taking
too many penalties — makes the
road ahead even bumpier.

“Against Penn State (West),
we just lost our discipline,”
Hockey Club President Matt
White said. “Against the better
teams in the league, we have to
play more disciplined hockey,
and that’s all there is to it.

“We’re not going to go to the
championship of the league
with stupid play like that.”

Rookie ‘phenom Bill Elliott
paced the Panthers against Lock
Haven with a career-high five
goals, along with two assists.

At the outset of the game,

were falling all over each other.

Finally, with just over nine
minutes remaining in the first
period, Disanti took matters into
his own hands.

After several three— and four-
man rushes failed, Disanti
grabbed the puck from deep in
the Panther zone, skated along
the left wing boards untouched,
and buried a slapshot after
entering the Lock Haven zone
to give the Panthers a 1-0 lead.

That goal was the spark that
the Panthers needed, and
school officially began on the
unwilling Eagles.

The Panthers opened up the
floodgates with three more
goals in a span of under two
minutes, starting with Disanti’s
second goal on the same shift —
a precise redirection of the pass
by Sean Engel, giving Pitt a 2-0
lead.

Pitt increased the lead to 3-0

T homas. aims for consistency

Pitt basketball's
soph swingman
primes for
improved play
in second year

at college level

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

The shot was heard all around
Oakland last year. No, it wasn’t
a drive-by shooting. It was
rookie Garrick Thomas’ 22-foot
jump shot with four seconds left
that sank the number seven
team in the country and the sole
powerhouse in the Big East,
Seton Hall.

The six-foot-four-inch
guard/forward was used to such

heroics in high school. At.

MacArthur High School in
Texas, he averaged 25.6 points
per game and was on the All-
State team.

“Coming from being the man
in high school to a role-player
here was tough. If I become the
man here, .then it happens. If it
doesn’t, it doesn’t,” Thomas said
modestly.

After Midnight Madness last

year, when Thomas stole the I

show in the slam dunk contest,
Pitt fans were in ya Garrick
Thomas frenzy.

He appeared on the cover of
The Pitt News basketball pre-
view and everyone coined him

 

  6” Cese Pizza

“the man.”

But Thomas was plagued
with inconsistency last season
and as a result, received mini-
mal playing time.

“Last year I had to deal with
my streaky shooting,” said
Thomas.

“I had streaky practices and
streaky games. I felt that
the coaches didn’t have confi-

‘ dence that I could step up

and play the role of the two-
guard.”

This year, Thomas’ streaky
shooting isn’t his main concern
his knee is. In early
September, Thomas underwent
arthroscopic surgery for a torn
cartilage.

The irony of the injury was
that he didn’t know about it
until a week after it happened.
Thomas’ said that while he
was playing, Eric Mobley fell
one way and Chris Gant fell the
other way.

Thomas jerked his knee and
he felt a pop.

“I don’t know how I injured
it,” Thomas said. ’

With the injury, along with
the recruiting of long—range
shooter Sotiris Aggelou and a
healthy Jason Maile, Thomas’
off—guard position will be cut
into severely.

His role this year will be at
the small forward position.

“We’ll wait and see how his
knee comes around before we
define his role,” assistant coach
Nomi Law said “He will proba-
bly play- mostly small forward
for us.”

“He’s a good athlete, with
quick jumping ability and long
arms. He’s a good shooter,
which will pull the defense out
for the big guys inside,” Law
said.

Thomas likes to think of him-
self as more of a “‘tweener.” He
can shoot the three and take the
ball to the hole strong.

In Texas, Thomas has worked
on his game all summer in the
Chevron Pro—AM League and
feels he is a much improved
player.

“This year you’ll see a differ-
ent Garrick Thomas,” he said.

Truth is, the team with the
argument is Notre Dame.
FSU is probably going to
pound Nebraska, taking the
number-one ranking. The
Irish and Seminoles will both
have one loss, with ND win-
ning the head-to-head battle,
but it will be Florida State
that is number-one.

All other considerations
aside, we should do any-
thing humanly possible to
avoid a celebration that
would include the tomahawk
chop. Even its political incor-
rectness is not enough to
make it tolerable.

-The 20th—ranked (USA
Today poll) University of
Connecticut men’s basketball
team devastated Virginia 77-
36, which is ranked 22, last
week. Does anybody actual-
ly think UConn is only two
spots better than the
Cavaliers at this point?

With Georgetown already
having losses to Maryland

13

and Villanova, the Huskies
have established themselves
early as the team that will
challenge Syracuse for the
top spot in the Big East.

-We had not seen Markus
Naslund fight until last
week’s game against the
Whalers. After watching his
“battle” with Randy
Cunneywoith, does anybody
wonder, why?

-The Penguins have not
been impressive. Mario
Lemieux may never be a full-
time player again. Tom
Barrasso has been out for a
while, and had one of the

. worst save percentages in

the league. Jaromir Jagr is the
only member of the
Penguins among the league’s
top scorers.

Oh yeah, one more thing.
Pittsburgh is still on top of
the Northeast Division. ‘Nuff
said. '

Rebuilding    

Continued from page 9

“I don’t know if you want to
call it a formula, but I’ve learned
from the people around me and
the coaches I’ve had,” Majors
said.

If Majors doesn’t have some-
thing tangible he can use as a
formula, there certainly is some-
thing cognitive about the way
he approaches the rebuilding
process. It seems to be some-
thing bred into him. He just
knows what to do.

“I love to compete,” Majors
said. “When I was a boy, I was
the one organizing the games
and running the games.”

Majors admits that he has
always been a builder and a
competitor. He speaks at length
about the impact his father and
former coaches have had on his
career as a coach.

I shall pass‘ through this
world but once 

Majors late father, Shirley,
was a builder of programs in his

- career too — albeit at lower lev-

els of competition. Shirley
Majors took over Huntland High
School, Tennessee school that
had not had a football team at
all, to 3-5 record their first year.
Shirley, who John played for

‘in high school, closed out his

career at Huntland with a 70-1-1
record in his final ten years.

Shirley eventually moved on
to Sewanne University of the
South, where he spent 21 years
and was named Small College
Coach of the Year in 1973.

John Majors also credits his
former college coach at
Tennessee, Bowden Wyatt, for
shaping the success of his own
coaching career. Majors said this
is where he learned discipline
and togetherness “from men of
character,” which he says are
ingredients forwinning.

Therefore, Majors’ formula is
merely a result of his training
and background.

 Any good therefore that I
can do or any kindness that I

can show 

Majors gives the air of a man
bound to rebuild once again.
He stares out his ofﬁce window

— located inside Pitt Stadium —

as if expecting to see the rejuve-
nation process going on before

his very eyes. When speaking of

the job at hand, he paces back
and forth like he does on the
sidelines during autumn after-
noons.

“I’m a part of this university,”
Majors said. “I’m not just the
football coach. I’m here for the
whole university.”

If Majors is a part of the _uni-
versity, and if he is only one
part, then there are more peo-
ple than just him working
toward the same end.

Bob Smizik reported last
week in The Pittsburgh-Post
Gazette that a significant contri-

bution toward the downfall of

the Pitt.-' football program was a
lack of cooperation between
former athletic director Ed
Bozik and former coach Mike
Gottfried. Smizik said “Gottfried
fought Pitt administrators on
many fronts.”

Both Majors and Jaynes
agreed that working hand—in-
hand is a top priority if the pro-
gram is to resurface.

“They have been support-
ive,” Majors said. “I expect them
to be. You can’t get it done
without it. It’s impossible.

“It is hard enough to win
with everyone pulling the same
way  coaches, administrators,
players everyone.”

“It is important for every-

body to work in harmony,” I

Jaynes said.

A Lock Haven netminder for

his first goal of the game.

The last goal of this
quick barrage was scored
by right winger Toki
Barron, who found the
puck amidst a Hurry of
action in front of the net,
and scored, with Elliott
getting the only assist.

After three more unan-
swered goals gave Pitt a
commanding 7-0 lead,
the Eagles finally suc-
ceeded in delaying the
inevitable by scoring a
goal with 8:47 remaining
in the second period to
cut the Panther lead to
7-1.

The Eagles would also
score the final goal of the
game with 4:45 left, but
only after the Panthers
added five more in the
meantime, making the 12-
2 ﬁnal a real laugher.

They will need to cor-

rect that monkey in the I

wrench for their show-
down with the Indians
