gagement with the forces of gen-
eral apathy.

An official communique from the
TPA naval base disclosed that each
crew member will wear insignia
and 9. nautical cap. Advance train-
ing has prepared the crew for sal-
vos of stamp-licking.

Quartermaster G. S, Rupp, as-

Policy Convention Today

Independent party will meet today in its annual convention, as
Hiram Milton, C42, chairman, continued to blast the “miserable condi-

tion of student government at Pitt.”

Milton has asked all non-fraternity students to attend the con-
vention in 24 Cathedral at 12:30 o’clock.

The convention, he said, will do-
cide “whether we will participate

become a farce. Nothing is ever

been selected and crew duties as-
signed by Admiral Herbert Gall,
M43. 0
Heavy casualties are anticipated
among the capital ships of the
Non-Stamp Buyers, since small
units of the local fleet will patrol
shark (and wolf) infested waters
of the Tuck shop near the islands
of Java and Coca Cola.

Another landing force will at-
tempt this week to reach the shores
of Faculty isle, where previous
landing attempts were foiled on the
beaches in clashes with the land
units of General Indifference.

Senior Women Fete

On Eighth Floor

Although not completely reno-
vated, the new men’s lounge on
the eighth ﬂoor opens this morn-
ing at 9:30 o'clock and will be open
every school day henceforth from
this hour to 4:30 o’clock.

The room, which until two
weeks agli was the Men's Tuck
shop, temporarily is arranged in
four sections: a game corner, a
music corner, a reading corner,
and a lounge corner. In the center
is a large table with several chairs.
A statue of a. crouched panther
decorates the table.

Furnishings yet to be installed
include pictures on the walls, more

done. Because of the cockeyed elec-
toral system it is extremely diffi-
cult to eliminate the do—nothings

now warming seats in the Student-

Faculty association.

“Student government has no real
contact with the students and
makes no effort to solve their prob-
lems. Therefore IP must decide
what it is to do about student gov-
ernment and that is why the con-
vention has been called.”

Milton continues, “We urge
every non-fraternity student who
thinks student government can do
something for him to come to the
convention in 24 Cathedral today."

be employed by nations which
threaten, - or may threaten,
aggression outside of their

wider and permanent system
of general security, that the
disarmament of such nations
is essential. They will likewise
aid and encourage all other

practicable measures which

will lighten for peace-loving
peoples the crushingburden

The_ “Duke.” is coming to town.

Ye7s,'E1lington, father of Ameri-

can jazz, brings his band into the
Stanley theater on Friday. He
is celebrating his twentieth anni-
versary this week. i
The composer of such hits as

“Sophisticated Lady,” “Mood In-h
digo,” ‘‘I Got it Bad,” etc., has ‘

just waxed a new record with two
songs of his own composition. Ti-

tles are “I Don’t Know What Kind I

of Blues I Got,” a vocal blues num-
ber, and “Are You Sticking?” a
patriotic instrumental swing tune.
’By the way, in a very short time,
Duke and Orson Welles are going
to make a picture based on Ameri-
can jazz since 1900. Something
worth waiting for, V
‘Hurray for Rey. Alvino, he of
the electric guitar, has just waxed
the terriﬁc “Army Air Corps
March." Very patriotic and timely.
Reverse is “Little Hawk” which

features quite a few spot jazz

‘choruses moving along at break- -

neck tempo. Don’t miss this one.
Did you know Woody Herman
has a girl trumpet player in his
band? Her name is Billie Rodgers.
You can hear Billie on Merman’s
latest recording on Decca called

 

“Even-Steven.” MisslRodgers does
‘a hot vocal chorus and then takes
off a la James. Very solid.
“l..ittle Cousin” is here, I mean
Benny Goodman’s recording‘ of

same. It's a terriﬁcally moving 

tune with a Russian “ﬂavor.” Flip-
over is the new doubletalk tune “A
Zoot Suit.” Highlight is a choice
hep vocal by Art London.

There is a new song hit coﬁfingl

your way. ’Twa_s written by Ruth

Lowe of “I’ll Never Smile Again”
fame. Title is “It’s Raining Mem- ,-

ories.” Fred Waring has been fea-
turing the lilting ballad and you’re
going to hear a lot about it inthe
near future. Remember we told you
so. _
lf you can possibly drag. your
date away from Ted Weems at -the

Military ball next Friday night, 

(and there is no reason why you
can't), it will be well worth your
while to go over to the Blue Room
and catch an earful of Billy Mun-
day and his fine young band.
Here’s a compact and solid group
that can play a sweet and swing
tune and still sound good. I think
you’ll agree with us that Munday
has as ﬁne a. set of pipes as you’d
want to hear.

Drills; Allislnouse   Eligible ‘

An announcement made by the
University athletic administration,
declaring that George Allshouse,
senior center on the Panther foot-
, ball team the past season, is eligible
to play another year, removed one
of the many headaches'Coach Char-
le'y Bowser is suffering these days.

Allshouse was injured during his
sophomore year and did not see
i any ‘action, thereby causing Pitt
officials‘ to reconsider his status.
The husky gridder will be starting
his ﬁfth year at the University,
\pursuing his studies in the Dental
school. ,

On the other hand, Coach Bowser

has to cope with the inclement

weather and a rumor that regular .

halfback Bill Dutton is facing in-
duction into the army. The News
has not been able to reach Dutto-n
forcomment on this rumor, as to
whether there is any truth to it
or not. Should “Wild Bill” be un-
able to play this fall, another big
gap in the already weakened Pan-
ther squad will be created.

Another attempt to inaugurate
the spring drills will be made this
afternoon. ‘However, the decision
is entirely up to Jupiter Pluvius.
New equipment’ has" already been
issued to_ the veterans and pros-
pects and they are anxious to get

going.

Possible material for stardom in
this year, providing,-of course, “that.

curtailed while a leveling effect is
felt throughout society.”

Dr. Verne Wright, associate pro-
fessor of sociology, divided his
topic of “American Attitudes On
War” into ﬁve categories:

1. Pro-Axis attitude of people
Either related or deeply sympa-
thetic with Japan, Germany, and
iiltaly, These persons comprise about
one per cent of American popula-
-tion.

2. Persons who would prefer to
be on the side of the Axis and those
who support the war though un-
willingly; These comprise about
two or three per cent.

3. Paciﬁsts- and isolationists
snake up less than one percent.

_4. Reactionaries and conserva-
-tives who still think that we should
‘have: stayed out of the war com-
. ‘ prise between ‘ﬁve and one per cent.
-5. Persons who believe in the in-
'4  evitability of the war and that our
position is in it comprise the over-
; whelming majority of 90.per cent.

Dr. Stanley Gray, assistant pro-
-fessor of psychology, on the «sub-
G ject of “Moi-ale" confessed that he

could not state the exact factors
, which govern public morale. He
said that “one would t.hinl<- that
complete, eﬂicient propaganda
would deﬁnitely inﬂuence morale
and public opinion." This, how-
ever, has not always been the case,
he contended.

He stated that in the last presi-
dential campaign the Republicans
‘overwhelmed the Democrats in the
ﬁeld of propaganda, but the Demo-
crats won at the polls.

He termedmorale as “Uniﬁed
Motivation” and said that only a
A total war psychology ‘could win the
war.
V “Morale is not very good,” he
maintained. “If it were, there
would be no petty squabbles over
working hours, no strikes and no
one’s war proﬁts."

Dr. Wright corroborated Dr.
Gray’s statement about the condi-
lzion of morale, declaring that the
complacent condition was due to
the average American’s attitude
of an easy victory and the lack of
_ confidence in the national govern-
r ment.

Mr. Arnold explained that the 

government will soon double the
number of students who may take
the CAA primary groiind and
ﬂight training courses, and will

treble the number who may take 4

advanced training. This means
approximately 42,000 students

ed CAA program.

Military Supply Truck
Crashes, Disrupts Classes

Overturning with a crash, a huge \

trailer truck Monday morning dis-
rupted classes
Boulevard side of the Cathedral,
and damaged several Pitt students’
automobiles.

Foiir cars were damaged, one
belonging to William Saalbach,
M43, and another to John C. Towns-
end, C43, but the extent of destruc-
tion could not be determined.

Students heard the siren of the
truck’s police escort, and looked out
the windows in time to see the

truck careen wildly around the cor- V

ner and turn on its side, barely
scraping the parkedcars.

Carrying a load of army supplies,

the truck was behind schedule and A

was being speeded through the city
until the accident occurred. Police
and soldiers guarded the truck as
it lay on its side in puddles of
gasoline.

The driver was only slightly in-
jured.

Several fourth period classes
were virtually dismissed by the stu-
dents who thronged out to the

scene of the accident. Only the rain "

coming‘ about an hour later kept
the crowds small enough to avoid
a traﬁic problem.
