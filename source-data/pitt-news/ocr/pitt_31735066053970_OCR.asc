 

The water in the Litchﬁeld Towers
will be ﬂooded with scalding water today
to rid the plumbing system of Legionella,
the bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ dis-
ease.

Pitt officials and the Allegheny
County Health Department revealed yes-
terday that two Marriott employees were
infected with Legionnaires’ disease over
the summer, and the bacteria that causes it

has been found in the Towers’ water sys-

tem. A
Legionella bacteria from a plumbing
system travel through the air on small
drops of water from faucet spray and are

"light entropy."

Legionnaires in Towers water

Disease-causing bacteria infects Marriott employees over summer

inhaled into a person’s lungs, where it

g becomes the fonn of pneumonia known as

Legionnaires’ disease.

Towers’ plumbing lines will be ﬁlled
with water heated to over 170 degrees
Celsius today, and then ﬂushed clean to rid
the system of the bacteria.

“High temperatures will totally
destroy the bacteria after the ‘heat and
ﬂush’ method occurs,” said Guillermo
Cole, spokesman for the Allegheny
County Health Department. “After that we
will retest the system to make sure the
water is clear of Legionella.”

Pitt decided to test the water lines for
Legionella after the two Towers’ cafeteria
workers were diagnosed with
Legionnaires’ disease.

“After the two Marriott workers were
diagnosed with the disease, and the

Allegheny County Health Department rec— _

ommended Pitt test the water as a result,”
Pitt Spokesman Ken Service, said, “we did
the test as a precaution, and Legionella
was discovered, but not through the whole

system, and not in high concentrations.”

Service said that no other employees
or students have contracted the disease
since the summer.

“Only those two workers were diag-
nosed,” Service said. “The fact that we
haven’t had any cases in the past two
months really indicates that there is no risk
to students.”

Cole also said there is very little risk to

Pitt reacts

to Bigelow

closing

Forget everything your mother ever
taught you about crossing the street. You
can now run blindfolded between the
Cathedral of Learning and the Wﬂliarn Pitt
Union if you want to.

On Monday, the city of Pittsburgh oﬂi-
cially began the 30-day trial closing of
Bigelow Boulevard between Forbes and
Fifth Avenues. Despite all the tensions sur-
rounding the decision, the actual shut—down
was quiet and trouble-free.

“I think the actual closing really went
we ,” said Bob Harkins, director of parking
and transportation at Pitt. “We didn’t really
armounce that we were going to do it just
after midnight so I was really surprised that
there were some students out in support of
the closure.”

Many of the 30 or so students that
came out to show their support that night
were from Pitt’s Student Enviromnental
Action Coalition (SEAC). They canied
signs pledging their support for a perma-
nent closing. ’

“I want Bigelow closed because I don’t
like playing ‘Frogger’ with my life,” Elly‘

Glenn, a Pitt senior and SEAC member,

. , ‘ . . . . . . . . . . . .

said. She was refening to the popular Atari
game of the early ‘80s where a ﬁog had to
hop across a busy highway. '

Mike  also a SEAC member
and senior, said, “A huge problem in cities
is that they are dominated by roads and
buildings. There is no green space for peo-
ple to enjoy. They become choked and
clogged with ma .”

Kaizar said that SEAC believes that
Pittsburgh has too many roads. “This city
caters completely to cars. Part of making a
more livable and environmentally ﬁiendly
city is actually tearing up a lot of the roads
and making green spaces,” Kaizar said.

Creating “green spaces” wasn’t every
student’s motive for supporting the closing.

“I’m not here because I think that it
should be a greener campus — I came to

 

SEAC members show their support of the Bigelow closing Sunday night.

Pitt because it’s a city campus,” said Jaime
Caplan, a Pitt freshman. “It would just be
nice to not have to worry about being hit by
cars.” .
Other students that were present also
had concerns about safety when crossing
the street

‘This is all part of showing campus
unity,” said Adam Neary, a Pitt junior. “It
shows that students, all of us, care about our
own lives and safety. Students fought to get
this road closed. It’s an example of student
power.” ‘

According to Harkins, the closing has
gone very well so far. He said that on
Monday some of the shuttles were running
a little behind schedule due to the extra dis-
tance, but they are back on time now.

Peace Corps
recruits help for
global projects

Dee
.:?.:.;a.

Malcolm Asté and Connie Hedrington,
two recruiters and former volunteers of the

' Peace Corps, spoke to Pitt students last night

in the William Pitt Union.

Hedrington said the main objective of
the evening was to recruit and to assist stu-
dents interested in the Peace Corps toward
achieving their goal.

On Jan. 20, 1961, President Kennedy
initiatedapeaceproposalinhisinaugural
address, with the intent to “help the people
around the globe, in order to help them help

p themselves.”

This organization was later called the
Peace Corps.

Hedrington and Asté were here to
include Pitt students in that great tradition.

Hedrington and Asté spoke to a small
group of students interested in the program.
Aside from training, pay, and medical cov-

erage provided by the Peace Corps, .

Hedrington and Asté stressed the cultural
and educational experiences that students
receive from volunteering.

For students who are interested, Peace
Corps assignments occur strictly abroad,
and are currently available in over 90 coun-
tries around the world.

Volunteer work ‘takes place in ﬁelds
such as agriculture, education, health, engi-
neering, and other skilled trades are avail-
able to those who have a college degree or
three to ﬁve years of work experience.

“Recruitment of volunteers here at Pitt

will depend upon the motivation and desire .

of the senior class,” said Hedrington.
Volunteers receive $5,400 after they
have served for 2 years, or $200 for every
month a volunteer served. But since the vol-
unteers live at the same level of the people
they are helping, that money stretches a long
way. .
“The living allowance is modest, how-
ever, it is more than enough to maintain a
standard of living in the areas the volunteers
work and live in,” said Hedrington.
Volunteers live, eat, and adapt to the culture
of everyone they work for, she said.
According to Hedrington, the Peace
Corps is always looking for recruits, but can-

KUWAIT - After a one—day delay,
Kuwait agreed to receive additional U.S.
troops on its territory Monday, though the
Pentagon said it had not issued a ﬁnal go-
ahead for their deployment.

However, President Clinton said that
the United States was not out to force a
showdown with Iraq. As Clinton officials
toned down their rhetoric over a possible
confrontation with Saddam Hussein,
3,000 troops at Fort Hood, Texas, wait to
see whether they will be ordered to
Kuwait.

If these 3,000 troops are deployed,
they will join 1,200 other members of the

“I keep walking around and saying to
myself, ‘Where’s the tmlﬁc?’ It’s just not
there,” said Harkins. “People have been very
helpful to us in terms of making traﬂic ﬂow
better.”

Harkins said that they were also moni-
toring all the parking garages and so far none

of them are reporting being filled to capaci— A

ty.

Harkins said few people have reported
any problems to the University. “Our com-
plaint line has been relatively empty so far,”
he said.

Students who commute to class have
said they haven’t had too much trouble get-
ting through Oakland either.

“I left my house an hour early
[Monday] for my night class, and I had
almost an hour to kill before it started,” Jim
Dixon, a Pitt sophomore, said.

Traﬁic in Oakland appears to be mov-
ing relatively smoothly and there isn’t much
diiference in the amount time it takes to get
through Oakland, said Dixon. I

didates should expect a competitive selec-
tion process.

“Although the selection process is com-
petitive, any applicant who has the willing-
ness to help others and the desire to seek the
speciﬁc skills required to make them a
stronger candidate will be a prospective can-
didate,” Hediington said. ‘

Both Asté and Hedrington stressed the
importance of volunteers gaining an in-
depth skill in languages from the village
they work in. In addition, the Peace Corps
provides valuable experiences that are good
references to those seeking employment
after-returning to the United States.

Asté said that access to federal jobs is
extremely high for Peace Corps volunteers
due to their leadership qualities and the work
experienced abroad.

“Americans have a limited knowledge
of the world, other than from watching tele-
vision. The Peace Corps provides a broader
vision of what the world is about,” said Asté.

Many current political ﬁgures have
served in the Peace Corps, ranging in oﬂice
from state supreme court justices to mayors
to state representatives.

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and his
wife are former Peace Corps volunteers who
served in Paraguay. There are also six for-
mer volunteers who currently occupy seats
in congress.

Since they worked overseas this sum-
mer, two Pitt seniors, Leanne Lemon and
Krista Behrens, have been looking forward
to joining the Corps.

“After working this past summer with
volunteers in Somoa, I feel the Peace Corps
represents America well,” said Lennon.

people opposing the trial closing, but few
people have complained about space. ‘
“Parking hasn’t been a problem at all,”
said Kim Hince, a part—time student and
cormnuter. “You’re crazy if you park on the
street in Oakland anyway, especially with
the discounts you get with your ID at the

garages.”

If you are enjoying not having to ﬁght
cars to cross the street, Harkins said that there
is something that you can do to make the
closing permanent. “If you support this,
make sure you let the mayor know. We need
to make it known that people support it.”

Latin dancer shakes it up at Katz Business School

 

If you don’t know how to dance,
then the Katz business school is the
place for you.

At least that’s what Barak Levin,
a 26 year old Pitt MBA student, said
while establishing a Latin American
dance club at Pitt.

For four weeks, Levin hasbeen
offering dancing sessions at the Katz
School of Business for MBA students
exclusively. But recently Levin

decided to try and enable more people
who are interested in Latin American
dancing to participate. Therefore, he

recently applied for and was granted
club status at the William Pitt Union.

“We want to open the meetings to
undergraduates, faculty, and staff 
[and] everybody and anybody who is
interested,” said Levin.

Levin began to learn ballroom
dancing in Israel, his native country,
five years ago, and eventually
became interested in Latin American
dancing three years ago. From then
on dancing became a part of his life
— a part he wishes to share with oth-
ers.

When Levin came to the United
States two months ago to study in the
Pitt MBA program he had no inten-

tion of starting a dance club. But after
spending time on campus and having
no luck locating a good dance club in
the area he decided to do something
about it.

He teamed up with Joanna Lee
Bing—Yu, also a student of the Katz
business school, who had three years
of dancing experience. Together they
successfully launched the first ses-
sions of the Latin dance parties at the
Katz school.

In order to promote and advertise
the first of the Latin dance parties,-
Levin used several strategies. Fliers
were used to describe the essence and
purpose of the club, colorful banners

were hung in the lobby of the Katz
business school to attract attention,
photos from the learning sessions
were placed in the lobby to activate
interest and provide imagery, and a
special web page was created to pro-
vide daily and weekly updates and
information about the club. I

Levin received a great amount of
help from Robert Nachtmann, the
MBA program coordinator, who
allowed Levin to utilize the lobby for
advertising purposes. Nachtmann
also aided Levin by ordering refresh-
ments for the dance parties, making
ﬂiers for students, distributing adver—
tising materials, and much more.

The club started with 15 mem-
bers, but shortly those 15 turned into
30 and as each day passed, more and
more people became interested in the
Latin Dance Club, which gave Levin
the idea that he should try to extend
his club to include all those people
associated with Pitt.

As a result, he has filled out the
necessary application at the William
Pitt Union in an attempt to be allowed
use of the ballroom for the Latin
dance parties. “The ballroom of the
union would provide more room for

. the ever—increasing number of people
attending the sessions,” Levin said,

“and it would allow the possibility of
using better sound equipment.”

For all those wondering which
dances are being taught by Levin at
the Latin dance parties, they are the
merengue, the salsa, and the lambada
—— dances which Levin proclaims
“are the sexiest ones in the world.”

The Latin dance parties begin at 8
p.m., and for the first 45 minutes,
Levin, with the help of Lee Bing—Yu,
teach the beginners the basic steps of
the dances. Afterwards, they move on
to more complicated steps.

Currently, Levin has decided to
concentrate on one specific dance at
each meeting. One meeting will be
devoted to the merengue, another the
salsa, and another the lambada. But
as the Latin Dance Club becomes
more stable within the coming weeks,
all three dances and new dance moves
will be taught at each meeting.

Levin stresses" that even people
who think themselves to be uncoordi-
nated can learn how to dance, and he
said that if you were to look at people
whom he has taught to dance, you
wouldn’t know that they had attended
only three or four meetings.

“It’s great. Levin is very good. I
didn’t expect to learn so much so
fast,” said Adel Al Ateeq, a Katz

MBA student and current business ’

manager of the Latin dance club.

“It is a brilliant idea and it’s a lot
of fun,” said Naira Vordapetyan,
another attendee. “You can socialize

Pyschologist provides students with career education

 

The Pitt Placement Center’s job fair
started its week-long series of events
with the “Careers for Creative and
Unconventional People” seminar which
was held Monday afternoon.

The seminar was hosted by Barb
Juliussen, a placement counselor in the
College of General Studies, and by
noted psychologist and author Carol
Eikleberry.

Most of her placement technique,
described in her book “The Career
Guide for Creative and Unconventional
People” comes from years of personal
experience helping people focus their
careers.

She targets people who are not nec-
essarily happy or satisfied in their work.
“The first step is to focus on the part of
reality to which you are most sensi-
tive,” said Eikleberry. Targeting an
aspect of your life with which you are
comfortable and then “bringing what
you know together and solving the
problems in that area” are the essence
of getting a good job, according to
Eikleberry.

She said people need intrinsic moti-
vation to do what they want to do.

“This makes your job effortless and
less stressful  it is ﬂying with the
wind, not against it,” Eikleberry said.

Within the coming weeks, Levin
will be contacting the different
Caribbean and Latin American

he also hopes to get local bands to

Within the next two weeks, there

any people who are the “slightest bit

He also recommends that new
dancers come to the Latin Dance
Club 30 minutes before the session
for registration purposes.

He not only pointed to his desire
to share his knowledge and enjoy-
ment of dancing with others as his
reason for starting the Latin dance
parties, but he also said, “It is my

am taking towards meeting that

“What you do quickly relative to other
people and what you are doing when
you lose track of time, are both indica-
tors of a task which is not only of inter-
est to you but also what you are good at
doing.”

If a job seeker is still not clear as to
what skills they can offer after asking
these questions, there are a lot of “inter-
est assessment tests” available,
Eikleberry said.

The Self Directed Search, Strong
Interest Inventory,’ and Myers—Briggs
Type Indicator are just three types of
such tests. “The counseling center on
the third ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union
can assist students in obtaining and tak-
ing these tests,” said Juliussen after the

 

lecture.

The Strong Interest Survey costs
students $5, a fee to cover the sending
and processing costs of the survey,
whereas the Myers—Briggs Type
Indicator is free to Pitt students.

“The benefits are that these tests
boost your confidence and help you to
place the right skills in prominent
places in your resume” said Eikleberry.
She said that this is one way for the job
seeker to market himself for a job.

Eikleberry also suggests that stu-
dents “ask significant others what they
think you are good at.” She also said the
job seeker should “honor occupational
daydreams, not write them off.”

She said that too many people

ARC urges health care students to get involved

Michelsﬁmith

.4-.c4'o  .2». '15..

The Association for Retarded Citizens-
Allegheny Institution wishes to open its
doors to Pitt students who have a heart.

The ARC—Allegheny is located in
Pittsburgh and supports children and adults
with mental retardation and other disabili-
ties.

The agency has existed for 45 years. It
was established in the early ‘50s and only
consisted of 25 families. Today, the agency
annually serves 6,000 clients.

The agency is volunteer-driven and
welcomes anybody who wants to help. Pitt
students seeking careers in health-related

 

ﬁelds such as social work and personal care
could gain experience by volunteering at
ARC-Allegheny. Fundraising and working
with the clients are jobs other Pitt students
may want to participate in.

Patti Marino, executive director of
ARC-Allegheny, and Arthur Marino,
administrative assistant for communications

.and foundations, are trying to involve the

agency with activities at Pitt such as Greek
Week. The association would like both
sororities and fraternities to sell cards and
calenders to raise money for a donation.

Students can also wrap gifts for retard-
ed children during the holidays as a dona-
tion for the association.

“It’s a great opportunity for students to

get involved with ARC,” Arthur Marino
said. “Helping people with disabilities sets
examples and shows the clients their
strengths as well as it helps them feel good
about themselves.”

Children and adults with retardation are
provided with full service and support
throughout their lives by the organization.

Clients are also guaranteed therapy and
network support for their families. The
agency possesses a parent-to-parent group
which travels to nearby hospitals to visit

mothers and new born infants with mental

retardation.

Residential homes in the community
are occupied by adults who wish to obtain
their independence. One hundred teens and

adults live on their own in the residential
housing, while young children remain at

I home with their families.

Parent network support groups come
into the houses to watch the children and act
as a care giver in the home. “We offer sup-
port to make the clients as independent as
possible so that they can be included in all
facets of community life,” Patti Marino said.

The agency also offers vocational
schooling for clients. Teens and adults are
trained and often start off working in restau-
rants throughout the community.

“Everyday people learn more about the
abilities rather than the disabilities of the
people with mental retardation,” Patti
Marino said. “With a little support they are
not any different than you and me. They
make great students, neighbors, workers,
and frien .”

The Marinos encourage any students
interested in volunteer work at ARC-
Allegheny to call 322-6008 Ext.424.

‘The only people at risk are older
adults and people with weakened immune
systems,” Cole said. “People recovering
from something like mononucleosis could
be at a slightly greater risk, but there is still
a very small chance of them getting
Legionnaires’.”

Symptoms of the disease include a loss
of appetite, weakness, muscle ache, fever,
dry cough, nausea, and diarrhea. The health
department is recommending anyone with
those symptoms see a physician immedi-
ately.

“We’re advising anyone with those

dent,” Cole said. “Employees of Pitt should
see their family doctor.”

While most students are not at risk,
Cole said the strain of Legionella found in
the Towers’ plumbing is the same strain that
infected the Mariott employees.

“We are almost certain that those work-
ers became infected with the disease at the
Towers’ complex,” Cole said. “However,
those workers were very old, and I believe
both of them were smokers, which also
increases susceptibility to the disease.”

Ken Service said that the infected
workers received treatment for the disease
and have frilly recovered.

“They are perfectly alright now and
back at work,” Service said.

Cole emphasized that the bacteria
could not be transferred from other people
or through food handled by someone
already infected with the disease.

“Legionnaires’ is only transferred
when the bacteria is in a ﬁne mist or spray
of airborne water that is breathed into the
lungs,” Cole said. “If you inhale that bacte-
ria then Legionnaires’ develops. That’s the
only way to get it.”

Service said that the University hesitat-
ed releasing news of the bacteria because
testing was not yet complete.

“We were working with the health
department on tests and then a possible
treatment for the bacteria’ in the water,”
Service said. “We were planning on
armouncing the discovery of the bacteria to
our students ﬁrst, but the health department
released the information early.” 4

Cole said that the information was held
until now because testing was not conclu-

"The tests were performed only a cou-
ple weeks ago, and we have been working
with Pitt on devising a treatment for the
bacteria since then,” Cole said. “We have
been questioned about the issue by the
media for quite some time, so we went pub-
lic with the information [ﬁrst].”

Superheating the plumbing system
should rid the Towers of Legionella for a
few months, Cole said.

“I understand Pitt is looking at instaling
special equipment in a few months to ion-
ize the water and protect the system by low-
ering Legionella cells to near or at zero,”
Cole said. ‘”I'hat’s the only way to protect
any system against the bacteria.”

Help to make ”Fer|o
Park” a reality

We have come up with the perfect plan to keep Bigelow
Boulevard permanently closed; we will remodel the space and
rename it “Ferlo Park”

Fellow students, please help by bringing buckets of green
paint to give the pavement a healthy, grassy look. Those of you
who are artistic can paint ﬂowers and other assorted park entrap-
ments. Get out all of your old plastic ﬁchus trees and tropical
foliage. Another nice touch would be for those of you who own
plastic yard ﬂowers that spin in the wind, lawn chairs and oma-
ments (pink ﬂamingos, anyone?) should bring those over as
well. We will make Ferlo Park an oasis of beauty for the entire
year round.

Some of you might be questioning the reason that we
would like to call our grassy knoll “Ferlo Park.” We would like
to name our little piece of heaven after The Honorable Jim
Ferlo, city council president Even though Councilman Ferlo
has been dead-set against the closing of Bigelow Boulevard, we
think that he might be persuaded to support a permanent closing
by having his name in lights over our paradise. VV1th the afore-
mentioned enticement, this is an offer no one could refuse.

Of course, Councilman Ferlo isn’t the only obstacle in our
path to victory. As this battle has been waged, other opponents

- — O, who could they be — have made themselves known. The

SGB will be surveying local businesses to see who is in support
of a permanent closing after a week and thus ultimately in sup-
port of students. .

Students are a permanent part of the Oakland community.
While individual students may come and go, students as a group
are here permanently. Their concerns as a permanent part of
Oakland merit attention.

We need to exercise our ﬁrst amendment rights and peace-
fully congregate in the area of our future park. For the next 27
days, Bigelow Boulevard is our space. We have to make sure
that it stays that way permanently.

Help to make Ferlo Park a reality. Bring yourselves, your '

outdoor adomments, and your voice and park them on the
closed Bigelow Boulevard.

An advertising insert was
included in last week’s paper enti-
tled, “She’s a Child, Not a Choice.”
I must beg to diﬁer. “ t” is a choice,
actually, because the last time I took
a biology course, the uterus is an
organ . located deep inside a
woman’s body, over which she has,
for better or worse, some ultimate
and inalienable degree of control. It

‘is my contention that this is really

what the whole issue (or non-issue,
pun intended) is about. Control. It’s
like gun control, and like drug con-
trol; whoever has it get’s picked on
and whoever doesn’t have it whines
about it. When really, it’s a moot
point, and when it comes to the
contents of women’s ‘ uteruses
(uteri?) I don’t see how you can get
much mooter.

The insert in our paper con-
tained nothing more than propagan-
da masquerading as information
(whereas at least opinions colurrms
are nothing more than propaganda
masquerading as propaganda). I am
not going to bore you with reitera-
tion and refutation of all the argu-
ments which you already know, ad
nauseam. Instead I am going to
bore you with something complete-
ly different. Like what goes through
my tiny mind when I read the crap
which is presented as information.
The “Dear Reader” letter on the
second page did contain the asser-
tion that “[those who consider abor-
tion as a] women’s rights issue have
been withholding critical ir1forrna—
tion from you.” Hmm, I wonder
what critical info they mean?

Well, here’s Michelle C. on

quite possibly evil personiﬁed. ' .

page 12. “Don’t make my
Mistakes.” What’s the story? It
seems she had an abortion and then
regretted it; however, she has been
forgiven by God (I wonder if He
wrote or called?), and Michelle C.
now pickets the sidewalks outside
abortion clinics preaching absti-
nence. The only critical thing I can
see in this information is that if you
see her on the sidewalk outside
Women’s Health Services, get
away quickly ——- a lecture designed
to alleviate her guilt by increasing

sanctirnonious bom-again 
Although there was no evi-
dence of it in this bad advert, there
is one argument which causes me
some slivers’ of cognitive disso-
nance when it comes to abortion,
and that is the argument from sin-
cere and thoughtful people (as
opposed to guilt mongering pseu-
do-religious quacks) who argue that
the sanctity of life is too great to be
messed with by us inept humans.
All of us have had occasions to be
awed by the mystical and sacred
aspects of this mortal coil.
Choosing between two evils is a
task we all face at times. Playing
God is a_role we surely know we
are ill-equipped to perform, so we
stumble about in the dark and hope
for the best. Therefore, it always
seems overly presumptuous when-
ever somebody peppers their con-
versation with references to some
deity, as if they knew it’s mind, with
intimate detail. One thing I am rea-
sonably sure of, however, is that
using “God’s will” as an excuse to
oppress and control a speciﬁc social
group is obnoxious at best and is

 

A funny thing happened on the way to the abortion clinic

If you feel paralyzed by guilt
over having an abortion, then don’t
have one. If you feel paralyzed by
guilt over having a baby, don’t have
one. And if you are just paralyzed
by guilt, take two aspirins and call
me in the morning. If you think life
is sacred, you have a point, and I
agree with you. Life is sacred.
(Especially that which already
resides on the planet in semi—solid,
viable form). In my book, that
means all life, the good, the bad,
and the ugly (with the possible
exception of the ugly — if my life
is good, and you are ugly, then
don’t come crying to me with your
sperm count and expect me to fall
over backwards and bear your ugly
offspring). This is what really ticks
me off about this whole debate. The
offensive assumption that the con-
tents of my own personal uterus is
even a subject of public debate.
How dare you presume to tell me
which products of conception I will
and will not include in the rest of
my life.

The advertisement in our paper
was pathetic as regards “informa-
tion” or even any compelling argu-
ments. So some silly girls regret
their abortions. Too bad. So some
abortion workers get sickened by
the procedure. Not surprising. So

some people would never have I

abortions under any circumstances,
and never regret it. Good for them.
So what? Do any of these reactions
justify the Nazi premises and prac-
tises of the ant:i—abortion move-
ment? I just don’t think so.

p.r. taylor is the proud possessor of
a uterus over which she exercises
sole discretion.

A letter in response to ”Are church and Pitt separated?”

I would like to respond to Matt
Mills’ editorial, “Are church and
Pitt separated?,” which appeared in
the September edition of The Pitt
News.. In this piece, Mr. Mills
decries Muslim students’ use of an
alcove in the GSPIA/Economics
library as a prayer space. I take
strong issue with some of Mr.
Mills’ claims and demands.

First of all, Mr. Mills’ claims
that the Muslim students benefit
from a politically correct “double
standard”: “If I were to attempt to
devote a permanent space in any
university facility to Christian wor-
ship  [I] would be regarded as a
religious lunatic extremist.” Mr.
Mills’ claim is misleading on two
counts. For one, this prayer alcove
is not at all a “permanent space;”
those rugs could be quite easily
moved. For another, the University
frequently accommodates Christian
students, such as myself. During my
years at Pitt, I have attended Bible
studies and religious social activi-
ties on University property many
times; nobody has ever stigmatized
me as some sort of cultist psy-
chopath.

Mr. Mills is also terribly incor-
rect in attributing his fellow stu-
dents’ unwillingness to support his
crusade against the Muslim prayer

alcove to either “apathy” or “a fear
of political correctness.” On the
contrary; I feel that our fellow stu-
dents are merely displaying the tol-
erance that is necessary for the
health of any religiously pluralistic
community. What Mr. Mills mistak-
enly calls a vice, I recognize as a
virtue. Indeed, as a practicing
Christian, I know that I have bene-
fitted from this same spirit of toler-
ance as practiced by my non-
Christian fellow students; as a
teacher, I have seen this virtue prac-
ticed by the students in one of my
composition classes as they read
and discussed a religion—themed
essay by one of their Muslim class-
mates.

I must also take strong issue
with Mr. Mills’ claim that, regard-
ing his opposition to the prayer
alcove, he needs “help to protect
the Constitution.” These Muslim
students in no way pose a threat to
the Constitution; nor, for that mat-
ter, do the Christian students with
whom I have shared Bible studies.
These Muslim students are not forc-
ing non-Muslims to pray with them,
nor are they denying anybody use
of the disputed alcove outside of
their prayer sessions. They are not
diverting University funds for use
in proselytizing people to Islam.

Nevertheless, Mr. Mills suggests
that the dignified and considerate
actions of our fellow students
somehow threaten the foundations
of our nation; this suggestion
strikes me as one designed to awak-
en feelings of bigotry in his readers.

Unfortunately, it is not only

“Muslim students who Mr. Mills

appears to be demonizing in his edi-
torial. He also attacks “today’s lib-
eral elite,” whom he claims stand in
opposition to the United States’
founders. Such blatant libera1-bash-
ing, rather than shedding light on
the issues Mr. Mills raises, merely
perpetuates stereotypes and divisive
rhetoric.

Ultimately, it is Mr. Mills’
intemperate rhetoric which most
undercuts his own argument. In the
conclusion of his piece, he urges his
fellow (presumably Christian) stu-
dents to “force the library to
remove the Islamic prayer space.”
Why is there a need to “force” any-
one to do anythingregarding this
matter? Would not dialogue, toler-
ance, and mutual respect be pre-
ferred to a divisive holy war? I can-
not believe that any of my fellow
students would really like to live in
the type of hostile, polarized, uni-
versity community which such
actions would lead to.

I would like to end my rejoinder
on a personal note. Before accept-
ing an English Department teaching
assistantship for the Fall of 1994, I
had had some social interaction
with Muslims. Several semesters
later, I can say that I have worked
very closely with many Muslim stu-
dents, and have greatly valued my
relationships with them. When,
after reading Mr. Mills’ editorial, I
paid my first visit to the alcove
which, so horrified him, I did not
feel threatened either as a Christian
or an American. On the contrary, I
felt a sense of peace and happiness
upon considering that, in that very
space, some of my brother and sis-
ter students regularly kneel and
seek communion with a power
greater than themselves. Whatever
our own theological leanings, this is
surely an enterprise which we, as a
student body, can support. In con-
clusion, I would humbly ask Mr.
Mills and the rest of the student
body to recommit themselves to
manifesting a spirit of tolerance,
mutual respect, and fairness regard-
ing each others’ faith. In a pluralis-
tic community such as Pitt, such an
attitude is no 1uxury- it is a necessi-
ty.

Hang’em high: the death penalty is necessary justice

 

I was watching “60 Minutes” on
Sunday and saw a report that really
pushed my buttons. According to the
story, the district attorney of Bronx
County, N.Y. feels that he is above the
law — that he can ignore New York’s
capital punishment statute just
because he doesn’t agree with it. I’m
from New York and know first—hand
that state residents have been lobby-
ing for the death penalty for years.
Governor George Pataki won the
1994 election because he supported it
and Mario Cuomo did not. But now
the entire legislation is in severe trou-
ble. In neighboring Westchester
County, a murderer can receive the
death sentence if found guilty, but
across the street in the Bronx, the
same crime receives a much less
severe punishment. This is a severe
injustice.

In this country, you can’t throw a
stick without hitting a bleeding heart.
Someone is always ready to say that
capital punishment isn’t fair — that
it’s inhumane. Well, was it humane
for the murderer to kill his victim?

It is getting harder and harder to
find the justice in our judicial system.
This trend of putting the concerns of

criminals before those of victims
should be disturbing to anyone who
thinks about it. It’s supposed to be the
other way around. Wise men often say
that justice is blind, but the Bible,
which is supposed to be the supreme
governance of all Christendom, says
that justice should be distributed “an
eye for an eye, a hand for a hand.”
Many of the people who renounce
capital punishment are from the
“Bible Belt.” Do they realize what
hypocrites they’re being?

One of the more popular argu-
ments against capital punishment is
that it doesn’t work or deter crime in
any measurable way. I challenge the
people who make this argument to
take a look at the criminal justice sys-
tem we’re using now. We spend mil-
lions of dollars annually to keep pris-
oners alive and in jail. For what pur-
pose? Reform? Statistically, reform
doesn’t rank much better than the
death penalty. People don’t just
change. For them to have become
criminals, society allegedly wronged
them in some ghastly manner, so why
would they suddenly have a change of
heart and embrace the institution that
tramped on them originally? In jail,
they glean benefit on top of benefit,
all at the taxpayers’ expense. For
instance, if my financial aid for next

semester falls through, I can commit a
crime, go to prison and get my college
education for free. I can get rewarded
for being bad! Does this make people
think twice about committing another
crime?

Capital punishment would be the
right tool for reducing crime if only
we would cut through the bureaucracy
and red tape. Convicted felons typi-
cally spend up to 20 years on death
row before they make it to the gas
chamber. Why? Appeals. Again and
again our justice system lets prisoners
appeal their sentences. Then, if they
do get released, often on a technicali-
ty, the whole process was a waste —
an expensive, drawn-out waste.

If no one takes capital punishment
seriously to begin with, why should
criminals? That’s why we haven’t
seen a decrease in violent crime in
states where the death penalty is in
place. The bad guys are laughing at us
from their jail cells and hideaways.
They’re getting arrogant, thinking
they can get away with whatever they
want because there’s no serious pun-
ishment for breaking the law. What
are a couple of years in jail? There’s
always appeal and parole. Compared
to the price victims pay, criminals
receive only a slap on the wrist.

rights, but we’re taking this to an
extreme. If someone commits a crime,
he automatically forgoes those rights,
privileges that were intended for law-
abiding citizens. He should have a fair
trial by jury with good legal represen-
tation, but that’s all. The punishment
should fit the crime, and it should,
above all else, be strictly enforced.

Let’s face it: most violent crimi-
nals are scum. What good are they to
society? It seems a travesty that we
insist on keeping them around. We
don’t need any more murderers or
rapists. None of the victims or their
loved ones are asking to have them
released back onto the streets. The
world is over-populated. We wouldn’t
miss the criminal element.

It’s time for us to get serious.
Fifty years ago, you could take a walk
at night without fearing for your life.
There weren’t street gangs roaming
around, thinking that they owned the
city streets. No one needed to buy a
weapon for protection. Now, even the
police are afraid of criminals. This is
out of control! Don’t you think that
it’s about time to make America safe
again?

THE PITT NEWS

Drew Kopp led Pitt in goals last season as a freshman.

Megan Borofski

 

When Drew Kopp was
growing up in Fairfield, Conn.,
he learned to play basketball
and tennis through his sports-
oriented family. However, it
wasn’t until he was introduced
to soccer at a neighbor’s house
that he found his true calling.

The 19-year-old sopho-
more finished last year’s sea-
son with the Panthers as the top
scorer, recording six goals and
three assists in his freshman
year, and is tied for the most
goals so far this season.

Kopp began his soccer
career playing in recreational
leagues and on travel teams
under the instruction of his
neighbor, who had played soc-
cer in his college years. Kopp
excelled on the travel team,
which won three consecutive
U10 (under l0—years-old) and
U12 state championships.

“It’s amazing to be that
young andbe known through-
out the state,” he said.

The Kopp family moved
from Connecticut to Lebanon,
Pa., where he joined the varsity
soccer team as a freshman at
Cedar Crest High School, and
continued to play basketball
and tennis. While he excelled
at all three sports, it was appar-
ent that soccer would prevail.

“I always knew it would be
soccer,” he said.

During the summer

between his junior and senior
years, Kopp won the right to
travel to Brazil to play with the
Select Team, participating in
eight games and training with
the Brazilian Club and profes-
sional teams.

“Going to Brazil made me
a lot more confident,” Kopp
said. “I was expecting it to be
really good soccer and really
good competition, and it was.”

Kopp led his team in scor-
ing his senior year with 26
goals and 14 assists (66
points). He was selected as a
first-team member of the All-
Lancaster/Lebanon League for
the third consecutive year, and
was named the 1994 League
MVP. He also garnered all-
state honors that year.

“Every year I played, other
people were ‘better,”’ Kopp
said. “But senior year was
mine.”

In October of his year,
Drew began looking seriously
at colleges. He was being heav-
ily recruited by Bucknell
University when his mother
suggested that he look into Pitt.
She had heard good things
about the business program,
which was his intended major.
Kopp‘ sent a letter to Joe
Luxbacher, the head men’s soc-
cer coach, expressing an inter-
est in finding out more about
the team and the University.
Luxbacher contacted some of

Cosby gives Pitt verbal committment

After losing two top high school bas— '

ketball recruits last season, Pitt Coach Ralph
Willard picked up the slack and landed a
verbal commitment from another top
prospect.

Atilla Cosby, a 6-foot—8 1/2, 200—pound
power forward from Oak ’Hill Academy,
made his verbal commitment after an oﬂi-
cial visit to Pitt last weekend, giving Willard
his third top 50 prospect for his 1997 recruit-
ing class.

Cosby, who’s seen his stock rise dra-
matically this summer, has not officially set-
tled on Pitt and wants to keep his options
open, according to Oak Hill Coach Steve
Smith.

“I think he’s still planning on making
some visits,” Smith said. “I don’t think he’ll
visit three or four more schools, but he still
wants to make some visits.”

Cosby is also considering Syracuse, St
John’s, Seton Hall, Arizona, and

Massachusetts, but playing-time at Pitt ,

could come sooner than at other schools.
Cosby’s verbal commitment does not
bind him to Pitt until he signs a letter of
intent. He is free to sign with another school.
The NCAA’s early signing period begins in
November. '
“For a guy his size, there’s no one

quicker in the country,” Smith said of Cosby. I

“He’s very talented. A lot of college coaches
who’ve watched him think he’ll be a pro.”

Cosby was Oak Hill’s second-leading
scorer last season, averaging 10.4 points, 6.4
rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game.

Earlier in the summer, Pitt received ver-
bal commitments from Chris Seabrooks and
Ricky Greer. Seabrooks, a 6-foot-9 forward,
averaged 15 points, 12 rebounds, and two
blocks per game last season at Northeast
High School in Georgia Greer, a 6-foot—5
guard, led Manhattan’s George Washington
High School last season with 26 points

Even Jim
Leyland
cured his
Pirate Fever

 

Pennant fever.

Right now, in places across this
nation, thousands and thousands of fans
are in the ﬁnal stages of pennant fever.
Symptoms include mass tumouts at base-
ball parks, conversations about baseball
playoffs, and a general ignorance of the
first few weeks of the football season. If
symptoms persist, they may lead to the
advanced stage of the World Series.

Fortunately, there hasn’t been a
breakout of pennant fever in this state
since 1993 in Philadelphia. This area had
a mild case in the early 1990s, but other
than that, nothing.

Instead, we have Pirate fever, which
is a little diﬁerent.

Pirate fever begins in mid—April, after
the Pirates have already been mathemati-
cally eliminated from playoff contention.
By May, Pittsburgh sports fans are
already standing in line for tickets — to
next season’s Steelers preseason games.

Symptoms persist until about rr1id—
June, when any traces of Pirate. fandom
disappear completely. The stadium gets
put under quarantine — no fans allowed
The owner whines and blames the lack of
fans in the stadium on the stadium itself.
The team trades any player with a pulse
and loses the rest to free agency. ‘

Jim Leyland has been suffering this
dreaded ailment for years now. It ﬁnally
caught up with him yesterday, and the
skipper announced his resignation —
effective immediately after the season
ends. This doesn’t help the team’s stance
in the city spotlight, since Leyland is the
only member of the organization that fans
don’t get confused with the peanut ven-

Something actually cheap at the campus bookstore

Paths of Glory '
Starring Tony Dorsett, Mike Ditka,
etc.
Directed by Sean Doughtery
Stuart R. Ross

Although Paths of Glory, a
sports documentary recording the
first 100 years of Pitt football, orig-
inally reached the shelves of your
local videostore (or Foodland) in
1990, the tape just went on clear-
ance at the campus bookstore.

The $4.99 price tag is chump
change. There can be no doubting
that Paths ranks as one of the slick-
est sports documentaries ever pro-
duced, rivaling anything done by

NFL "Films, the Godfather of the
underrated genre.

There can’t be a college football
fan anywherewho couldn’t marvel
at the sleek editing and complete
historical rundown, not only of the
football team, but the entire
University. This video evokes emo-
tions that send chills down the spine
of any Pitt fan ever to walk on
God’s green grass. Paths watered
my eyes on several occasions,
although I attempted to mask my
emotions from several females lurk-
ing the hallways where I watched
this masterpiece.

As the video opened, the haunt-
ing voice of Earl Mann charted the

early history of our Panthers.
Mann’s voice makes the video. His
narration rivals John Fascenda, the
original voice of NFL Films.
Couple Mann’s powerful, over-
whelming voice with classic instru-
mental and inspirational composi-
tions, as any quality sports docu-
mentary should, and it’s possible to
close your eyes and envision what’s
taking place.

What is taking place is some of '

the best footage ever compiled for a
college collaboration. Ross Sports
Productions scoured the archives
for footage from Marshall Goldberg
and the Dream Backfield, Glenn

Sutherland, who originally arrived
at Pitt from Scotland to play soccer,
but fell in love with American foot-
ball and went on to become a legend
of the game.

A Constant interviews from Mike
Ditka, Tony Dorsett, Matt
Cavanaugh, Goldberg and Johnny
Majors add to the authentic, nostal-
gic feel that Paths emanates
through its entirety. The segments
on Ditka and the 1976 National
Championship are the highlights.
The viewer gets to see the raw,
aggressive nature of “Iron” Mike
that not only typifies Western
Pennsylvania, but made Ditka a
world-wide celebrity.

And the scenes of Majors being
carried to the championship podium
by his players are touching. It’s cul-
minated with Majors talking about
nothing feeling better.

The film went on to document
the Dan Marino/Hugh Green teams
that dominated college football for
four years, culminating in the elec-
tric comeback victory against
Hershel Walker and the Georgia
Bulldogs in the 1982 Sugar Bowl.
Paths tells the entire story, mostly
the good, but also the bad.

I’ve seen few films that emo-
tionally moved me like this one; I
guess it helps to have loved Pitt
since childhood. But even if you’re
the casual sports fan, this video
should be in your collection. The
passion presented in this historical
documentary surpasses many
Hollywood sports epics, with the
exception of Field of Dreams or
Rocky II.

So, when you’re in line buying
books or if you just need some
poster supplies, check out Paths of
Glory. It’s the most affordable pur-
chase at the bookstore and you
won’t return it for cash at the end of
the semester.

Patrick Robertson

The Pitt women’s soccer team
took their show on the road this
weekend as they traveled to Penn
State and Youngstown State. They
were searching for their first win as
they left Pitt, but Friday the 13th
lived up to its reputation for the Lady
Panthers in Happy Valley against the
21st-ranked Penn State Lady Lions.

The Lady Panthers suffered an 8- -

O defeat at the hands of the Lady

"Lions. Pitt mustered only two shots

on goal in the game, both stopped by
Penn State keeper Robyn Van Praag.
The home team, on the other hand,
racked up 25-shots on Lady Panther
goalie Sarah Stout. Coach Sturk
noticed a lot of improvement in the
early part of the PSU game as his
team only gave up two goals in the
first 53 minutes, but after that the
floodgates opened and the Lady
Lions never looked back.

Penn State began the rout at the
10:57 mark of the first half when
Rachel Hoffman banged an eight-
yard shot home. Lauren Miller fin-
ished the scoring for the half at 37:46
when she booted in a 50-yard free
kick. Four more Lady Lions would
join the scoring parade before the
game ended. The game dropped the
Lady Panthers to 0-5, and lifted the
Lady Lions to 2-0-1.

The Pitt women’s soccer team
had to try and bounce back just two
days later as they played the
Youngstown State Lady Penguins on
Sunday. Head Coach Roland Sturk
was disappointed with his team fol-
lowing the game.

“I thought we were the better
team and should have won. Just as
the players got into the game they
saw they were a better team and then
seemed to let up.”

The Panthers did tally 13 shots in
this game, but could not solve the
problem of Penguin keeper Bridget
Frank. Youngstown State registered
their only goal when Missy Laforet
scored just inside the post from in
front of the net. Coach Sturk called
this a “bad goal” and said his team
just could not recover from it as the
game finished 1-0 Lady Penguins.

The Lady Panthers finally get to
come home after losing their first six
games on the road. The Lady

the references Kopp had provided,
along with some other coaches he
knew in the area.

‘‘All of them said pretty much
the same thing,” Luxbacher said.
“They told me that he was a very
good player that a lot of people did-
n’t know about yet. They felt he
would be a good player on the col-
lege level and that he could handle
the competition.”

Kopp visited during recruiting
weekend and spoke with the coaches
and players before making a final
decision. He chose Pitt over
Bucknell, Bloomsburg,
Elizabethtown, Ohio-Wesleyan, and
Millersville.

“I almost went to Bucknell. It’s a
really good school and the recruiters
were really great,” Kopp said. “But
when I came to Pitt, everyone on the
team was really nice and they were
all so close. The location of the city
and the fact that it was Big East
competition were also big factors.”

Kopp admits that it was intimi-
dating walking into the locker room
the first day of practice last August.

“I walked in with my roommate,
Phil Matilla, who was also a fresh-
man, and I felt so uncomfortable,”
he said. “But everyone welcomed us

stopped in the Steelers’ 24-6 victory over
Buffalo Monday night. Bettis ran for 135
yards and a pair of ﬁrst-half touchdowns
to lead the Steelers to their second straight
win.

Steve Christie’s ﬁeld goal put the
Bills ahead before Bettis sandwiched a
pair of touchdown runs around Norm
Johnson’s 30-yard ﬁeld goal.

The Steelers’ running back has rushed
for at least 100 yards in Pittsburgh’s two
victories.

The Steelers are 8-1 on Monday
nights under Bill Cowher, and have won
their last four meetings with the Bills at

Pirates get a new pitcher’s mound.

Most importantly, it gives no cure for
Pirate fever, only a diiferent hospital bed. If
this was what the fans truly desired, they
would go watch the Pirates get beat in
Cincinnati.

No. To ﬁx this sickness, the doctors up
in the owner’s box need to take some dras-
tic measures. That means spending money
— or, more accurately, throwing money
away— in ways designed to improve the
team and heal the fan base at the same time.

First, sign Albert Belle. He’s a free
agent. He’s also a mental case and a violent
loner. He won’t talk to the press and he’ll
cost a lot of money.

Perfect. This is the kind of guy that will
get fans interested in Pirate baseball. As an
added bonus, he can hit with power as well
or better than anybody else in the National
League at the moment.

 

FROM PAGE ll" 

Second, sign Tommy Lasorda as gen-
eral manager. He is healthy and unem-
ployed and might be the only living human
with a chance to turn the team around
Think about it — what young prospect or
cagey veteran wouldn’t want to play with
an organization led by Lasorda?

Third, bring in a manager that will
make the front page of the sports section
every day of the week. Larry Bowa, the

third-base coach of the Phillies who used to I

beat up toilets with baseball bats, is a possi-
ble candidate. So is Felipe Alou, who could
easily be lured away from a cash—poor
Expos’ squad if he fails to make the play-
oﬁ°s. Even a relic like Sparky Anderson or
an all—time great like Bob Gibson
(Cardina1s’ pitching coach) or Bobby
Bonds (Giants’ base coach) would make
headlines.

All of this involves money —'— some-
thing that the Pirates are desperately short
of at the moment But to get it you have to
spend it, and some wise moves like these
might just lift the state of baseball malaise
in this city and put fans’ funds back in the
owners’ pockets.

If not, it will be more of the same. To
paraphrase a famous saying ﬁrst used for
the Chicago Cubs, “Pirate Fever — Catch
It and Die.”

Kevin Lilley is a columnist for The Pitt
News. He wishes Mr: Leyland success in

ﬁnding ajob, hopefully with a major league
team this time.

Kopp

was the St. John’s contest, where he
scored the first goal of the game and
teammate Travis Kruse scored the
last. St. John’s came back to tie, but
Pitt won.

“It was such a great game,” Kopp
said. “Coach was saying ‘We need a
goal, we need a goal,’ and I just went
in and did it. It was special because
Travis and I were both freshmen, and
St. John’s was ranked at the time.”

Although he says he was unsure
of how his freshman season would
turn out, he credits hard work and
dedication to his successes.

“I came in, not knowing what to
expect,” Kopp said. “I got on the field

and played hard, and my confidence
grew, and the team’s confidence
grew, and everyone believed in each
other.”

Now, a full year after walking
into that locker room for the first
time, Kopp has made a name for him-
self.

“Drew is a marked man this
year,” Luxbacher said. “People know
his name and people know his num-
ber, but that’s all a part of being a
good player. He’s got a great work
ethic, and he has the talent and works
hard. He turns in solid, consistent
play and we can always count on
him.”

Four games into the season, Kopp
has already scored two goals for the
2-1-1 Panthers, who face Seton Hall
at the Pitt Stadium on Friday night.

“So far, I don’t think we’ve
played anywhere near as good as we
can, but that’s good - we don’t want
to peak early,” hesaid. “Once we get
the ball rolling, we should be alright.
Every game, we have a shot.”

Coach Luxbacher agrees. “We
have a good bunch of men. I think
that we have enough talent if we can
get everybody on the same page.
Everybody has high expectations in
the Big East, and every game is going
to be a battle.”
