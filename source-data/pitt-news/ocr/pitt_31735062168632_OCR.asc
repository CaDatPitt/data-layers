Housing Survey Points

To Better Medical Care 

A’ survey study of medi-
cal service at a Pittsburgh
low rent housing project by
associate professor Jerry A.
Solon, from the University's
Graduate School of Public
Health, may point the way
to meeting future medical care
needs in community housing
areas.

The survey, sponsored by the
Allegheny County Medical Socie-
ty with the backing of the US
Public Health Service, was con-

' ducted in 1946 and 1966 to study

the acceptance of a sponsored
medical service established at
the North View Heights public
housing project.

An overall view showed that
61 per cent of the project resi-
idents are now using the serv-
ices provided by Dr. Marcus ei-

ther exclusively or on combina-
tion with outside private physi-
cians, outpatient hospital clinics
and the facilities

—-medical care only one-third of
Dr. Marcus’ patients use her serv-

ices exclusively, with the other 
two-thirds sharing the services , V

with outside facilities.

Similar ﬁndings are reported
from sponsored medical programs
in New York City and Cleveland.‘

Dr. Solon underscored the im-

portance of continued research 

in providing necessary data for
the development of policies and
guideposts

communities.

The supposed “stigma” of state-relatedness is slowly being proven
- to be non-existent. When it became clear that the University was about to

 embark on a new relationship with the Commonwealth, there Were rapid

I cries that our standards would drop in the process.

These same Cassandras predicted that the level of the undergradu-

 ate student body would fall beneath previous classes. However the progress

0‘ on admissions for September 1967 seems to point to the opposite happen-
’ ing. ’

Apparently out-of-state students are not so upset by the discre_pency

" in the tuition scale that they are not applying to Pitt. Critics of the state-

relationthip had claimed that out-of-staters woul-d hesitate to pay tuition

 that was $1350 higher than Pennsylvania costs. But the applications from

’ the Cleveland area, for example, are double the number they were last year.
‘ Rather than the number of applicants being reduced this year, more

 students than ever are interested in coming to the University. By Novem-

 ber 1,1965 there had only been 7 ,O00irequests for applications. This year

there have been over 15,000 requests. In part the increase in applications

"I is due to a nation wide jump in the number of high school students applying

' to college. But much of it is do to the opening of Pitt’s doors to Pennsyl-

: Vania students from ‘low economic background who previously could not
Vpay our tuition. ’

At the same time these applicants are apparently high level aca-

-demic achievers. Some had also predicted, that because of the new state-re-

lation, the University would have to take herds of mediocre Pennsylvania
students, This myth is also being gradually destroyed. In a study done of
300 Pennsylvania applicants for admission next fall, close to 50 of them
were in the top ten per cent of their class and had SAT scores totaling
1250. 100 of them, admission Dean C-ritchﬁeld said, could have been ad-
mitted immediately on the basis of their high school records.

Two problems however still plague the admissions department. One
is the shortage of dormitory space. Fortunately dormitories, will be built
in the near future (even though their location is of dubious advantage.)
Residence halls are a top priority necessity if the University is to a cos-
mopolitan educational center.

The second problem is out-of-state tuition. While out-of-state stu-
dents seem more interested than ever in Pitt, the University does restrict
its possibility for admissions by having such a high tuition rate. Giving
more scholarships to these students is not the -answer. A gradual cut in the
tuition rate continues to be badly needed. The administration and the
Board, of Trustees have made it clear that no action will be taken on the
tuition rate this year.

But 1967 holds the potential for bold steps that could greatly
strengthen the University. A tuition reduction for out-of-state students
will have to be one of thesesteps. ‘

GOLDWATERISM IS dead.

 Barry Goldwater’s humiliat-

ing defeat of two years ago

has been buried under the

victory scores of dozens of
liberal Republicans, the one
outstanding exception ‘being
Ronald Reagan’s victory in

California. The crushing blow

of the 1964 Presidential cam-
paign took its toll,'but while
the Republicans were recov-

ering from their almost ir- .

reparable losses, an amazing
transition occurred, result-
ing in the birth of a new Re-

’   gpublican Party.

As the CBS newscasters

H. reported the election results,

they pondered over an inter-
esting phenomenon — how
strange it was to discuss un-
and-coming Republicans. The

victories of Charles Percy.

Edward Brooke. and Win-
throp Rockefeller. to name a
few, expressed a deﬁnite
voter preference for the new
breed of Republican candi-
dates. Unlike the negative

Goldwaterites, the new breed '

Republicans are the positive
breed. -
The only issue that voters
appeared to react against
was the racial one, as candi-
dates capitalized on the surge
of the white backlash. Ron-
ald Reagan’s stand against
open occupancy in housing
was a decisive factor in his
victory over California’s lib-

. ”eral Governor Edmund (Pat)

Brown.

REPUBLICAN CHARLES
Percy, too, in upsetting his
former professor, Democrat
Sen. Paul Douglas of Illinois.
inadvertently beneﬁted from
this backlash. “Percy never
courted backlash votes. But
resentment build up steadily
in Chicago this summer. as
Negroes rioted on the West
Side and the Rev. Dr, Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. led

' march after march of open

housing demonstrations into
white neighborhoods which
greeted them with rocks,
bottles, and curses,” says
the Pittsburgh Press.

‘ However, , George “Your
Home Is Your Castle” Ma-
honey was defeated in his

 norship.-,Mahoney’s sole cam-
 paign issue,’ was his gonsiis-gt

tent attack on open housing
legislation.

Winthrop Rockefeller,
brother of New York Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller, became
the ﬁrst Republican gover-
nor of Arkansas since Re-
construction. Winthrop Rock-
efeller won his victory over
ardent segregationist James
Johnson.

SIGNIFICANT, TOO, is
Massachusetts’ Attorney
General Edward W. Brooke’s
solid victory over former
Democratic Governor Endi-
cott Peabody. Brooke, the
ﬁrst Negro to be elected to
the U.S. Senate since Recon-
struction . days,’ received a
mandate from the Massachu-
setts electorate, 98 per cent
of whom are white.

In repudiating Goldwater,
the new breed Republican
Party demonstrated a new
vitality, as reﬂected by the

electorate. It gained three

new senators and a far larger
number of representatives
than an off-year election nor-
mally produces, 47. It won
22 of the 35 governorship
races.

This victory must be attri-
buted to the new breed. Gold-
waterism is diminishing ‘in
the Republican Party, as Re-
publicans begin to build from
the depths of humiliation_
They have succeeded in their
attempt to challenge the
Democratic majority. They
now have the forum to build
a Republican Party that will
seriously contend for the
Presidency in 1968.

» WHEN A six-year-old sees
a band of wild Indians rav-
aging a wagon train his sym-
pathies are usually with the
cowboys. There evolves a
cl_ear black - and -_white dis-
tinction — the cowboys are
the good guys," the Indians
are bad guys. Seldom does
the child realize movies are
primarily ﬁctitious and often
void of substantive evidence.

In Monday’s Pitt News a
"letter by Mr. Frank Kofsky,
Teaching fellow in History,
reﬂected the same type of
perception. Mr. Kofsky’s let-
ter focused on a column by
Alan Disler concerning Dr.
Martin Luther King’s visit
to Pitt. Although the Disler

column deserved some criti-

cism for its Buckley-type
tone, Mr. Kofsky’s retort re-
flected an equally narrow
perception of reality.

He addressed his initial
comments to Di'sler’s “mere-
ly acting as a hatchet-man
for the Office of the Dean of
Students.” He further‘ pre-
faced his‘ substantive attack
on the column by saying
“Nothing gets into the Pitt
News without approval of
the Dean of Students.”

THE BUCKLEY-DISLER
perception may "be closely
akin to the conservative out-
look- of the Office of Student
Affairs. Yet Kofsky’s state-
ments assert that there ex-
ists a direct cause-and-effect
relationship between the two
areas. He presents an all-
too-perfect syllogism: the
Dean of Students is conser-
vative, therefore, the Dean
of Students tells Alan Dis-
ler how to think.

Mr. Kofsky not only uses
fallacious reasoning, but re-
gresses to the intuitive ap-
proach of providing evidence_
He states that Earl Trent, a
student involved in the King
affair, submitted an article
that‘ “was not printed as
written.” He says the rea-
son was because “according
to one of the editors of the
Pitt News, the editor-in-chief
phoned the Dean of Students
office and revised Mr. Trent’s
article in accordance with
the wishes of Administration
personnel.”

Trent’s article was a. state-

‘ment issued to the Dean of

newspaper. Upon receipt of
the statement the editor-in-
ehief called the Dean of Stu-
dents for her comment on
the statement. Her comment
was that she would be talk-
ing to Dr. Kurtzman and
would make no public state-
ment. Unfortunately, Mr.
Kofsky failed to take time
to investigate.

TRENT’S STATEMENT
was used just as an inter-
view. It was not printed in
entirety, but the crux of his

.statement was presented.
Again the Kofsky approach

was to assume a relationship

between’ two events without -

researching the problem. The
same fallacious approach
stands as the basis of his
generalization about the

Dean of Students approving 

everything before publica-
tion.

It is true, as Mr. Kofsky
asserts, that student jour-
nalism can degenerate “when
students are too timid or too
apathetic to emancipate
themselves from the crush-
ing weight of in loco patern-
alism.” A historical account
of the Pitt News will show
that such is not the case
at Pitt. It will also show that
there have been many col-
umnists and letter writers
who are too stigmatized by
their own beliefs to research
an issue.

It is tragic that a student
at Mr, Kofsky’s academic
level will make assertions
without investigating the
problem with empirical tech-
niques. Indeed the tragedy
of the Kofsky letter and the
Disler column is a tragedy
of education. Each presented
a viewpoint from an opposite
end _0f the political spectrum.
Their common denominator
was a narrow, rigid frame of
reference. The result istwo

Hom’ng Plans
Fall Short Again

Editor, Pitt News:

Because I am the proud posses-
sor of a Homecoming ticket, I
have little to complain about. But
I must speak up for that unfor-
tunate 901st person who missed
out on a coveted ticket because
he had trouble crossing the inter-
section betwen the Cathedral and

C the Student Union.

I feel that the school should
rent the proper facilities to al-

‘low every Pitt student.to attend

Homecoming. There are many
ﬁne structures that could be used
which the Homecoming Commit-
tee _overlooked. For instance,
huge pices of canvas could be
sewed together and fastened
around Pitt Stadium with thumb
tacks. By doing this, at least 50,-
000 students would be able to
see the Homecoming concert in-
stead of the present 1,800. (Light-
ing facilities could be handled by
the candles left over from Lan-
tern Night.)

The Homecoming dance could
take place on the “Bridge to No-
where” where anyone causing
trouble could be quickly elim-
inated. Of course, instead of the
dance being a coat-and-tie affair,
it would probably be a ski parka-
and-earmuff one.

Finally some of the official
playing rules should be suspend-
ed for the Homecoming football
games. First, all home football
teams should automatically be
given at least‘ 75 points.

-Secondly, the playing‘ ﬁeld at
Pitt Stadium should be shortened
to 50 yards so that more date’
ickets could be sold at their
regular price. If these changes
took place, I feel sure that no one
would ever again criticize Home-
coming at Pitt.

Dean Clarifies
Secret Research

. Editor, Pitt News:

Miss Mary Lynn Brown did a
ﬁne and responsible job of re-
porting my remarks on classiﬁed
research before a recent meet-
ing of the American Association
of University Professors. May I
correct a misapprenhension that,
through no fault of hers, might
be gained by reading her story?
It would be a great mistake to
conclude that, because the face
value of classiﬁed grants amounts
to about eight per cent of the
University’s total grant support,
that eight per cent of our re-
search activity is classiﬁed.

A more meaningful comparison
is in terms of the actual expen-
ditures in each category during
the last ﬁscal year; this immedi-
ately reduces the ratio to a some-
what more than four per cent.
Furthermore, more than half of
this activity is conducted outside
of Pittsburgh and more than an
additional fourth is carried out
in campus institutes or centers
not affiliated with the,Universi-

‘ ty’s academic departments. Less

than one percent of research in
our academic departments is
classiﬁed and, to my knowledge,
no faculty member spends more
than ten per cent of his time in
such activities.

I hope very much that the Uni-
versity Senate and administration
will adopt a strong policy state-
ment forbidding classiﬁed re-
search except under unusual and
compelling circumstances. How-
ever, I do not consider that the
present nature _and level of our

      

research activity 1S m- '

port to the school in a car that
lacked good visibility, seat belts,
padded dash, collapsible steering
wheel, adequate handling, and
disc brakes. Had the Reverend
been allowed to ride in a Volvo,
these faults would have all been
corrected.

It grieves me to think that such
an important ﬁgure should have
been allowed to ride in such an
unsafe car. The Student Union
Board would be well advised to
remember the cry of the revolu-

Kofsky’s Logic

Editor, Pitt News:
Deductive reasoning is the pro-

& cess in which the relevent facts

are assembled and a logical con-
clusion ‘is drawn from them. It
is also the foundation of all his-
torical thinking. But a Teaching

"Fellow in History at this Uni-

versity, Frank Kofsky, has de-
serted the principle tool of his
profession in a recent letter to
this paper.

Looking at Mr. Kofsky’s argu-
ments one by one, it is clear that
they were not the result of care-
fully developed deductive re-
search. Instead, Mr. Kofsky in-
ductively reaches his conclusions
ﬁrst and then looks for facts to
support them.

' It is unfortunate, that in this
he has chosen to reveal “facts”

about this University that do not

exist.

Mr. Kofsky’s ﬁrst argument is
that a recent column in the Pitt
News was sponsored, by the Ad-
ministration. The author, he
states, is the “hatchet man” of
the Dean of Students, and it was

V in this capacity that his column

appeared.

The facts are that the author
never has met the Dean of Stu-
dents much less write the column
at her insistence. The column
was written at the insistence of
his conscience.

Mr. Kofsky’s next conclusion
is that the Pitt News is a pawn
of the Administration. He une-
quivoucly states that nothing gets
into the paper without the ap-
proval of the Dean of Students.
In truth, the opinion and con-
tent of the Pitt News is indepen-
dent of Administration control.

Finally, he states that Student ‘

Government and the Student
Union Board are tools of the
Establishment designed to keep
in direct contrast to the true
nature of both bodies as reveal-
ed in the new constitution.

In all of these positions, Mr.
Kofsky has taken his stand on a
base completely unsupported by
facts.. II1:'_h_i_s_'capaci1':y,as 3 h

Social Season

Editor, Pitt News:

I can’t help but feel sorry that
Mr. Snyder (Letter to the Editor,
October 26) has received what
he feels is an unwarranted slap
in the winter social season. I
have, to feel sorry for anyone,
especially a poor Texas boy who
has been in Pittsburgh less than
six‘ years, whose social life, in a
metropolitan area of only 2.5
million people, depends on one
dance. His childhood must have
been, and apparently still is, very
unhappy.

The refusal of which Mr. Sny-
der complains was one of the al-
location committee’s rare exer-
c-ises of responsibility. Functions
such as Homecoming, Dorm Week-
end, and Winter Weekend should
be made to pay for themselves,

as they do on other university ‘

campuses. That they do not is at-
tributable to poor planning, an
abundance of other city activ-
ities, or that old standby student
apathy. Whatever the reason,
however, it should be obvious
that such functions do not de-
serve prime consideration at dole
time.

At this point _I will make it
clear that I‘am writing as a self-
appointed and, therefore, very
unofficial, but very disappointed
and indignant, spokesman for the
Hill Edudation Project, which, as
you might suspect I feel deserves
to receive more money than

WPDU or Homecoming, and cer-

tainly much more than it did re-
ceive.

Richard Thuss stated that the
allocations committee can give
money only to recognized cam-
pus organizations, “to recognize,”

in this case, being deﬁned as “to‘

become subject to the ﬁighty
whim and iron will of the den
of students.” HEP is, unfortunate-
ly, so recognized. But it received
only $375 from the committee,
approximately a 16th of what it
needs and a sixth of What it ask-
ed for. Apparently that means
that HEP has either been a sixth
recognized or ﬁve-sixths slighted.
In the latter case, it should make
the dean. of students very se-
cure to know that she and the
allocations committee are the
only ones in step, because every-
one else seems to have acknow-

ledged I-lEP’s existence by this.

time. Even the federal govern-
ment and especially the Negro
school children, many of whom
are waiting, and will continue to
wait, until we in HEP can afford
to get around to them.

Seance Held on KDKA

Houdini Returns At Session

by MARTY LIEBOWITZ

Everything is made com-
mercial these days, even se-
ances. Take the seance held
at the Craft Avenue Theatre
Halloween night, broadcast
over KDKA radio. It was the
fortieth anniversary of Har-
ry Houdini’s death. The

great man was to be called
back from the spirit world, and
in a moment of glory, displayed
before a curious and paying audi-
ence.

It was KDKA’s big Halloween
scare show that would top them
all. This was to be an historie
event—even more so than Dr.
Lord’s organ recitals of Tues-
day noons. Assembled on stage
were four experts; each in a par-
ticular ﬁeld, but each very much
related to the next.

At ﬁrst chair — bearing the
name of David Hoy—-sat a heavy
set gentleman wearing a bro-
caded gold vest. Hoy, the inno-
vator of various party games, in-
vented “Spin the Bottle, E.S.P.”
in which one could tell whom he
would leave the room with be»
fore the bottle was even spun.
As an “expert” on E.S.P. he has
also claimed to have the power
of foretelling the future.

Seated along side Hoy was Wal-
ter Gibson, a biographer of mag-
icials, collector of magic tricks,
and a personal friend of Hou-
dini. Also present was Gibson’s
wife, Ilka, formerly married to
the magician “Raymond the
Great” (whom she must have
despised since she continually
laughed whenever his name was
mentioned). Besides the associa-
tion with Gibson, Ilka was some-
thing in her own right-—a collec-
tor of African voodoo rituals.

To top off the list was Herbert
Beyer, a real unburier of the
dead (who by the way looked
very affluent).

As a prelude to the evening’s
seance, questions were taken
from the audience and listening
radio crowd. A young girl called
in and asked Hoy: “I think I
have E.S.P. How can I make
sure?” Hoy mumbled something.

With the show -about to begin,
Beyer placed himself in a pr¢.~
timed trance, took three deep

breaths and assumed a fetal posi-
tion in his chair. Three and one-
half minutes passed, and sudden-
ly, Beyer started to search for
something to‘ touch. Put at his
disposal was a letter, written by
Houdini to Gibson. Nobody had
ever touched it besides, Harry.
Gibson and the Postman.

The letter was read: “I want
to thank those of you who make
it possible for me to come here
tonight. I will reveal something
to Walter Gibson of a personal
nature. It deals with Prague.”

Could that be the end of our
lcng awaited Harry Houdini?
What will become of our Mystical
Magician? Where will he appear
again? What personal message
does he have to tell Walter? But
wait, Beyer is talking again.

“What I will shortly tell to
Walter concerns a new trick. You
will be able to alter ﬁngerprints
in such a way that they will be
reversed. However, this must be
kept secret.”

Suddenly, KDKA’s Mike Doug-
las butted in: “I hate to say this,
but our time has run out! I wish
we had more time but there isn’t
any. This is Mike Douglas and
his Halloween night scare show
broadcasting to you from the
Craft Avenue Theater bidding
you a very good night.” The
seance was over, and before leav-
ing, I went on stage to question
some of the experts.

Standing next to me was an old
gentleman who smelled from too
much Lucky Stfike. Besides these
attributes, he also had a long
neck, and bragged that he was
an “expert” on ﬂying saucers.
Finally, to get him off my should-
er, I asked him if he believed in
the “Pill”? “Which Pill?” was
the reply. He asked me if I be-

lieved in God; whereupon, I an-

sered: “Which god?”

When I finally approached Mr.
Beyer, another middle-aged man
jumped ahead of me. I listened.
The man related to Beyer that
one morning he had awakened,"
and at the foot of his bed, ob-
served 12 “cholars”—Plato, So-
crates, etc., etc. They were grin-
ing. They instructed this man to
take good care of his wife.

_ I asked some questions but I
mostly observed the -crowd. Per-
sons —- large and small — were
lined up in front of each “ex-
pert” with a paper and pen or
pencil—autograph seekers from
the valley of Pittsburgh. These
panel experts were their super-
men, their heroes. _ .

Had they ever heard‘ of Pablo
Casals, Copland, .Seeger, Buffy
Sainte-Marie, Sutherland, Steich-
en or the rest? It’s doubtful
But you can be sure they knew
the name of Mike Douglas, to
what church or synagogue he be-
longed, and on how many kilo-
cycles he was broadcasting. I
leave it to you.

Harvey Mudd College
Combats Frosh Slump  

CLAREMONT, Calif. (IP) __ The sophomore slump’
is the period of the academic doldrums in most colleges,
when drop-outs are high, but at Harvey Mudd College “the ,

s1ump’’ comes in the freshman year, says Dean Eugene 1
Hotchkiss.

In an effort to combat this, the faculty and administra-
tion have announced that no grades will be given in the freshman Fl‘-~ ,.
year, starting this year. Students will be notiﬁed of “satisfactory” {
or “unsatisfactory” work. However, all freshmen work that is not
satisfactory must be made up during the sophomore year.

Working on the committee which prepared the proposal on eval-
uation and grading were faculty members, the registrar and a senior
student, the chairman of the Student Academic Committee. This new
system eliminates the emphasis I
on grades, encourages the stu-
dent to study‘ for the sake of
learning, and allows the instruc-
tor greater freedom to develop
course material in the manner
most appropriate to the student's
needs.

One of the causes of the fresh-
man slump, Dean Hotchkiss said,
is that some students ﬁnd it in-
itially difficult to compete on the
college level in a school like
Harvey Mudd, where ‘the stan-
dards and requirements are high,
and where all freshmen take the
same courses. Some students who
have taken special courses in
their senior high school year can
get by with very little work.

both undefeated teams up until
then. And it occurred on just
such a Friday night in Florida.

“It happens to all teams when
they come to Florida; that balmy
