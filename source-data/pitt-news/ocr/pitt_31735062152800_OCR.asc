The Smith. Cabinet, composed of a

ﬁne collection of mineralogy speci-

mens, is now being rapidly installed

at the University after an absence of
almost ten years. The collection,
which is the property of the school of
Mines, is composed of a number of
large showy mineral specimens, some
shells, a few old animals, and a num-
ber of old coins and continental bank-
notes. The specimens have been gath-
ered from almost all parts of the
world. The best specimens are now on

This collection, which is one of the

pares favorably with the famous ones
in the British Museum, and the gov-
ernment collections in.Vienna and Ber-
lin, was "given to the University by the
Misses Jane and Mathilda Smith about
1890. At the death of the sisters a
few years ago, a sum of ten thousand
dollar? was bequeathed to the Univer-
sity for the maintenance of the collec-
tion. Among other gifts to the Uni-
versity from the same source are the
portraits hanging in the Chancellor’s
office and a bequest of ten thousand

PEAGE PLAN UUTLINED
  av FAMOUS Imion

A world’s peace movement, to be
started by the present neutral pow-
ers, with the United States as one of
the 'foremost countries in the estab-
lishment of the ‘movement, was the
plan offered by Hamilton Holt, editor
of the New Yorkilndependent, at -the
weekly assembly, in Memorial hall,
last Friday morning. Mr. Holt, who
is lecturing under the auspices of the
Carnegie Endowment for Internation-
al Peace, chose as his subject, “The
Great War and Peace Movement.” ‘

The editor\ condemned war on three
indictments that he thinks stand out
. most prominently, and forcibly to-day
in the great war in ‘Europe—-the ‘inor-
al, economical and biological view-
points. Speaking of the moral argu-
ment against war, he said, “I am
willing to accept the words of the de-
calogue on this score, ‘Thou shalt not
kill.’ ” As to the economical loss suf-

‘ fered by the 'confiicting'parties, he

said, the victor used to be ahead in

being privileged to gather together
what he desired as spoils. But to-day,
the victor fares little better than the
loser, there being nothing left in the
way _of material things worth ‘con-
ﬁscating. He predicted that war
could not last more than one and a
quarter years. The biological reason
why war should discontinue wasdwelt
on at length by the speaker. He said,

- “There are 10,000,000 men in arms in

Europe to-day waiting to drench the
ﬁelds with their blood.” “The loss of
5,000,000 men will setback civiliza-
tion foryears to a degree that possib-
ly never will be attained again.”

As a solution to the promoting of
peace, Mr. Holt offered three possible
and entirely necessary steps; (1) an

‘ extension of Democracy which can

only be attained within the ‘nations
themselves; (2) a spirit of good will,
an absolute necessity which our public
institutions and ; churches could foster,
and (3) a political organization, of the
world. This last phase is bycfar the
most important and difficult, accord-
ing to Mr.‘Holt, and must be brought
about by the “League of Peace”
method. *

“The United States is the greatest
League of Peace known to history and
it sems to be the destiny of the Unit-

Holt and closed his address by wel-
coming the day when ‘we, asa nation
can sign .an— “Inter-dependence” as
well as an “Independence” declara-
tion. '

PLANS FOR SUMMER
CAMP TAKING SHAPE.

Enough interest was manifested at
the meeting in preparation for the
summer camp to ‘indicate that the ef-
forts towards such a move would be
crowned with success. At the meeting
last Monday, a number of students de-
clared their intention of spending a
summer vacation in this manner.
While no deﬁnite steps" were taken,
the plans for the camp were discussed
in an informal way. As things are
now shaping up, three weeks will be
spent in a pleasant spot in the Adiron-
dacks, where the time will be spent in
a combination of work and play in
order to secure the greatest beneﬁt as
well as a pleasant vacation..A certain
amount of discipline will be maintain-
ed and the camp will be conducted
along military lines. v About 25 or 30
boys ar.e expected for the trip, and
any who are interested are asked to
see Charles S. Miller, at the Gymnasi-

um, as soon as possible.

MEDICAL FRATERNITY

ticing physicians of this vicinity who

Triple Clash Between Three
Rivals Attracts Much Interest
Throughout Country —— Affir-

Conﬁdence is being manifested in
debating circles this week as the Pitt
teams hold their ﬁnal practice before
the debates with Penn State and W.
& J. Although the teams from Pitt's
rivals are said to reach. the high mark
set by their predecessors, yet the men
representing the Gold and Blue are
expected to show the results, from a
long and careful study of the ques-
tion and so cwinthe decision on both
occasions. The debate with W. & J.
occurs at Washington, while that with
Penn State will be held in Thaw hall
on Friday evening, ._ April 9, at 8
o’clock. The question is “Resolved,
that the
Abandoned.”

The Pitt affirmative team, which
will remain here to meet their op-
ponents from the Center County seat
of learning. is composed of Ben Selek-
man and F. W. Glaser of the School
of Economics, and E. B. George of the
College. At a debate held early last
week, the team representing State de-
feated the boys” from Westminster.

»This debate is a triangular aifair,
and so on the same date, the Pitt nega-
tiv team will journey to Washington
to _ eat the W. .& J. team, composed.
of Earl F. Reed, ’15, King Alexander,
’16, and Harry Dunmire, ’17, Reed is
an experienced debater, having. been

‘on the team for the last two years,

and the other two men have shown up
exceptionally well in the trial debates.
The Pitt men are R. L. Spence, Col.

‘received, it is probable that Pitt has
again triumphed “O’er a stubborn

Next Friday ‘evening, April 16, a
Pitt aflirmative team’ will meet the
team from Westminster at Pittsburgh,
in a ‘debate on the same question.

The afﬁrmative of this debate‘ has a

A big Spring Festival. is being
planned -by the girls of the Women’s
Activities Association to be held some
time near graduation.

There wil be an old English pageant
including May Pole dances, old ‘Eng-
lish dances, a dramatic production of
Robin Hood, athletic events and music.

It is planned to have all the girls
in the University take part in this
festival and show the students and
friends of Pitt to what . extent this

performance of the year Monday
evening at the Schenley theater, when
it produced “The Maxixe Girl,” under
the management of the Harry Davis
Amusement Co., to accommodate those
who were unable to secure seats at
the Charter Day performances. As
was to be expected, the crowd was not
asilarge as before, but showed apprec-

LIGHTING SYSTEM.

.. Unﬂustered by a runaway, careen-
ing madly down the campus road, and
undisturbed by the rush of his com-
panions through the swinging doors
and down thelfront steps of State hall,
one noble college freshman \ “remem-
bered well the days of his youth,”
when the sophomores taught him to
use the basement steps of all build-
ings, 'and—missedi all the excitement
of seeing a miniature heavy-weight
battle betwen a grocery wagon and
the corner lamp post at the foot of
the hill. The result was that the pole
sustained a. knockout, while the vic-
torious vehicle was somewhat batter-
{ed up, but able to leave the ﬁeld by its
own horsepower.

The horse, owned by T. G. Lamont,
a grocer of 348 Atwood street, and
driven by Edward Lawrence, of Oak-
land avenue, became frightened, be-
cause of a break in the harness while
descending the hill, and dashed madly
down the steep grade. _At the foot
of the hill, the wagon collided _with
the corner lamp post and the driver
was tossed from his seat. He was
picked up, placed in an automobile,
and taken up to the Medical school.
He was found to be badly bruised, but
not seriously ‘injured and was later
taken to his home. When picked up,
he was semiconscious, but said later
that he did not remember ever start-
ing down the hill.

PLANS or DRAMATIC
CLUB PROGRESSING.

“Pitt” Players” is the name of the
new dramatic organization that has
been organized by Mr. G. M. P. Baird,
of the English department.

The organization meeting was held
at the opening of the Spring term and
about 35 men and women expressed
theirdesire to join. Mr. Baird out-
lined the plan of work for the society.
He said in part, that the “Pitt Play-
ers” will in no way conﬂict with the
work of the Cap and. Gown club. While
the latter has for its purpose the pro-
,duct:ion ofonly  comedies, the:
“Pitt Players” will stage modern
dramas. Moreover it will not rely upon
student activities funds to cover its
expenses,.as. do the other student ‘or-
ganizations. , No inducements of any
kind willbe offered to the members of
_the “Pitt Players,” no trips and no re-
ward—-excepting that which is derived
from the work itself—and it is under-
stood that all those that join are will-
ing to do a little hard work.

Two. more meetings were held and
a number of plays were read before
the society. It is the intention of the
“Pitt Players” to begin work on the
plays selected immediately and -to
stage them about the ﬁrst Friday in
ay.

Meetings are held every Tuesday, at
2:30 p. m., at 107 Thaw Hall.

College and the School of Economics who is not-working his own way
has a certain margin of time which he can and should devote to

SALUTATORY.

 

It would seem too un-editorial, no

V doubt, for a new administration to go
into ‘effect on THE PITT WEEKLY,
'1 without giving a measure of space to
’ olicies and credos. We hope to get
y, however, with the fewest possible

‘ splinters of a platform, chieﬂy be-
cause they are such hard things to live
“up to when you once have them nailed
down. We have made no promises to
anyone as to what or what not we will
attempt, and we will not have to re-
tract any. Surrounded alternately by
howling mobs of radical extremists de-
termined to batter down the defects
and excres.cences of" Old Pitt in a day,
and again by timid ﬂocks of conserva-
tives, eternally satisﬁed with the state
of things as they are, we have our own
V troubles in trying to keep our footing
on the rock of moderation, which must

be the basis of all true progress.

We have watched the course of sev-
.,..eral editors as they rose and waned,

' ;_and have noticed, or had the phenome-
—‘._“;nTOn called to our attention, that, how-

: ever uiidauntedly or self-reliantly they

: "went into the post, their determina-

_ tion paled with the passing days, and

V their reigns terminated in a lukewarm

“jacquiescence and self-abnegation.
‘ Whether this fact proceeds from mim-
terous trips to the carpet, the censure
" of fond friends, or the innate modesty
‘_of the editorial. mind, we have yet to
” discover. _:Th_e first is a natural .attend-

ant upon life, like marriage and
_measles, the second should be of no

weight .in the determination of con-

« duct, and the third has no proper place

5' in an editor’s makeup.
We are profoundly conscious of the
fact that the editorial column is regu-
larly the-last turned to, if tu_rned to
,it is at all. The only way to get peo-

‘ ple to read editorials, therefore, is to

 make them so continuously hot (oh, no,

-{not sensational), that the heat which

_‘,~tliey radiate will draw the gentle read-

lfﬁiei-’as the candle does the moth. Our

"policy (if such it can be called) for

.V "the succeeding thirty-ﬁve issues shall
.~ “ therefore be simply and solely to re-
.,___n_iove the familiar stigma of “Ortho-

"’dox,sheet,” and to do our darndest to
“make the PITT WEEKLY a factor

‘‘ alike in the councils and opinions of

the rude injuneer and the ravishing
co-ed. ,

 

SQUEEZING THE TURNIP.

 

. Rightlaway we will have to disclaim ’
.. all responsibility for any and all edi-
1' torial policies which have been promul-

ggaicd in this august colum for the

' , ‘past eight weeks. Their name is legion
-«hand their harmony quite terrible to be-
,5; Last, weekthe new and pro-
‘vvposed-semester system was given its
A ‘first airing in this sheet, with more

or le§s favorable comments thereon
by one of our esteemed colleagues.
These referred more largely to the
strictly‘ ‘academic side of the innova-
tion. That it would have very salu-
tary effects upon the scholarship of
bUniversity students, is a moot ques-
tion, although the lords of the faculty‘

‘Y . seem to have exercised their judgment
’ unanimously and favorably on this
point.

_ One sidelight that may be
thrown upon the change in time,
-arises from the prevalent fashion of

- ._;i,midye_ar commencements in almost all
- the high schools of the district.

. 3 . To
])3'0Vld8 for this large inﬂux of stud-

:  is, of courstegﬁilinpossible under the

ﬂip-ree-term sys . However, these

4 ‘phases concern us less nearly than the

economic side of the change, which we
.wish now to consider.

‘ We claim sufficient familiarity with
g he public opinion of the undergradu-
ate body of the University to know
that there is more than a little mui‘;-'
,muri—ng upon the all important point of

V (where the new system touches the’

._ issatisfaction at large among the
«.,student body, it is the duty of the
student publication to voice it, or at
east, to allow it to_ be voiced. Inas-
rich as the subject is in the prely dis-
ussional stage,_ at present, the WEEK-

y_ . desires to invite an expression of
f‘0I11Il10n from any or all who take an
interest in the matter, whether student,
lumnus or faculty member. Communi-
y.hcat_ions of reasonable length ( not over
;3(_)0 or 400 words) stating the point of
view of the writer on the proposed
£183,111 tuition, will be welcomed, and
shed ' in the WEEKLY’S Letter

 

 

Box, if the writer's signature is (given
as “an evidence of good faith. This
will not be used, if the writer so re-
quests, but anonymous epistles will
receive no consideration.

The arguments which we have heard
advanced against the higher tuition
are brieﬂy as follows: Granted, that
the two most desirable ends to be at-
tained in the University just at pres-
ent, are the elimination of congestion

is the advanced rate calculated to at-
tain either of these ends in the most
efficient and equitable way? In the
College, School of Education, and
School of Economics, the burden will
be manifestly felt the hardest. There
are no extra fees in the School of Eco-
nomics, beyond those paid in all
schools. In the College, Groups I, II,‘
and III are almost in the same cate-
gory, science courses therein being at
a minimum, especially in the junior
and senior years. In the remaining
groups, the change would more nearly
approximate an advantage, but there
are few students in any of the College
courses, whose fees for a given year
total $45. Of course, the abolition of
the present system of “groups” will
not materially change the composition
of the College student body, since a
natural graviation under the elective
regime will bring similar curricular
strata. In the School of Engnneering
some extra laboratory and shop-work
fees are at present levied. In the
School of Mines, special breakage,
assaying, and metallurgical fees bring
the total expense for the year close
to the vicinity of the proposed $150.
The students in the School of Dentist-
ry will be the losers, by comparison
with their present payments, to the
extent of from $15 to $25. Their pro-
fessional brethren farther up the hill
will not quite break even on the propo-
sition, their present amount of $220
being raised to $250. ‘In the School of
Law, the change will be manifestly
burdensome while the rate in the
School of Pharmacy remain station-

ary. .

That the registration will suffer a
material halt in its upward climb
seems a logical outcome during the
year 1916. The high cost of educa-
tion in a University receiving a meas-
ure of state" aid can not be conducive
to the arrival of the average high and
prep school graduates (which includes
the better grade of students). Many
are voicing the opinion that a stiffen-
ing of the .academic requirements,
both at entrance, and after entrance,
is the only ultimate solution to the
necessary process of weeding. Plainly
the present physical equipment of the
University is inadequate to accomodate
the present student population, but
whether the increase
funds will sufficiently offset the
diminuition of the ratio of registration
increase, is open to serious doubt.

Of course the spot where the shoe
pinches tightest is in the inequality of
requiring students who entered under
the old regime to pay the extra amount
during the remaining years of their
course. If the system could be put
into effect with next year’s entering
class, there would be less ground for
‘objection. Those who are now pa ing
part or all of their expenses will ve
very serious difficulties in meeting the
new demands. and many will undoubt-
edly be compelled to drop their studies,
at least temporarily. If the ideal of
the University is how best to serve
its constituency, so ‘that the advant-
ages of an education will be a matter
of democracy and not of aristocracy,
the change has its defects, which cast
a doubt upon its wisdom, if they do
not condemn it.

We want above all, a free and open
discussion from every angle and atti-
tude, upon this and every other vital
question, and it is to this end that we
call upon the readers of the WEEKLY
to make their ideas on the subject
known.

DEBATING: VARSITY SPORT.

We believe in students supporting
all their own activities, of what ever
name or sign. For which reason, de-
bating will continue to be hammered
upon in this column, until it receives
the support that it deserves. We never
expect to see the day when brain-work
will count for as much in the popular
would not want it "to be so. Probably
of the “martial virtues,” which are
the only saving grace of war, and
which must be perpetuated for the
best interests of the race. But-—-the
fact remains that debating, of all
extra-curricular activities, is least ap-
preciated, brings least of honor, and
in the end, the participant has the
least to show for his efforts. Of course,
it is true that the “sport” has not
been put upon the same business-like
plane in regard to publicity, organiza-
tion, and the like, as the other activi-
ties, except in particular cases, such
as that of the State debate of last
year, when the interest was largely an
artiﬁcial one created by the question.
Let’s start right now and help change
this. Friday night we have the best
opportunity. to redeem ourselves for
the miserable showing at the time of
the Allegheny debate. et’s fill Thaw

students that henceforward our var-
sity debate must be held in Carnegie
hall. And what’s the matter with hav-
ing “Red” Irvine and some of his new
cohorts on the job to cheer our “letter
men” on their formidable mission of

FETT’S FOUNDLINGS FEED.

 

 

On next Monday evening precisely
at seven-thirty (depending on whether
the toastmaster’s accompaniment hails
from Belleﬁeld or Bellevue) four hun-

dred and forty—more or less—— of the

young men and women from the De-
partment of Liberal Arts will sit down
to a sighing table in Kuhn’s place, and
while away three or ‘more happy hours.
This stunt of coking up social events
for their respective schools seems to
beabout the only function remaining
to the senatorial dignity, and it is

ardor. Inter-department competition
is healthy when it does not extend to
the degree of rancor, and these
banquets are the best possible means

Not with swords nor with guns
Will the battles be fought,

In the spring of the year,

In the land of the free;

But with many home runs,

And on many a lot,

The ball fans will cheer

And the crowds come to see——-
For thus battles are fought

In the land of the free.

Three balls and two strikes-—
See the ball cross the plate;
Three strikes and you’re out,
Struck ten minutes too late.

‘Slide for second you boob,

Now you’re caught in a trap,
There the bonehead is out— -
Who’s that gink at the bat?

Give that piker a curve I

And he’1l miss it a mile,

He'll lose all his nerve

If you pitch your old style.

Can’t you strike out that rooky ?—-
Wow-e-e what a clout,

There the ball goes a ﬂying

Right out of the lot—-

Yes-—you’ll ﬁnd these small battles
In each town that you see

For thus battles are fought

In the land of the free. ‘

TEAM sums
HEALWOHK

.Monday afternoon the ﬁrst. regular
baseball practice for the Varsity team
was held at the stadium. The weather
was ﬁne and over 40 candidates re-
ported for the initial practice. No

 

men to run around the ﬁeld a little
in order to loosen «up their muscles.
A few of the men have been working

out for the past few weeks and they

are rounding into‘ shape. a The pitch-
ing staff has been working out for
two weeks now and the twirlers are
beginning to buzz them across.

At present there are ﬁve candidates

' for the pitching staff. Langdon and

0

Riehl are last year’s men and are
coming around to their last year
form. Hart, one of the new men is
showing up well. Kennedy of Belle-
fonte and Black from Westminster
are the other two pitchers. Beatty
and Austin are last years catchers out
on the job this year. Matson, from
Shadyside and McQuiston, formerly of
Slippery Rock, both members of the
football squad are both good receivers.

With Captain Healey, Peck, De
Hart, Hastings, Carlson, Gray, Hayes
and Heil all ﬁghting for inﬁeld posi-
tions the work of the coach is not
easy. All these men are experienced
in the game and it will not be an easy
job to pick the best man. In the out-
ﬁeld there are Dillon, Englehart and
Morrow of last year’s squad. The
new men include Forney, Geisel, Fox,
Nelson, K. C. Morrow and the two
Eskeys.

The diamond has been put in the
best shape that it has ever been. A
new sliding pit has been constructed
near the training house. Coach Wil-
son announced that beginning Wednes-
day regular games would be staged

every day. The opening game is only"

two weeks from today and hard work
is the order from now on. If Captain
“Pink” Healey can spread his ’\en-
thusiasm to his men they certainly
should win all the games this year.
He claims that they will have the best
team around here barring none. The
material certainly is good and the
chances for a winning team are bright.

GYMNASIUM RECORDS
‘ ON -THE TOBOGGAN.

 

The spring contests for the gym-
nasium records will be held next week.
The winners of these contests will
have their names placed on the shields
in the gym. This is the third year
that these contests have been held
and there is great rivalry between the
different schools. All the ‘records
made the ﬁrst year have been broken
and many more will probably go by
the boards this year. The events are
only open to men taking regular gym-
nasium work.

The following records are the best
that have been made this year. S. R.
Henson, Engr. ’18, holds the rope
climb record of 13 ,1-5, lowering the
former record by 1-5 of a second. J.
A. Rodgers raised the fence vault
record to 6 feet to inch. W. W. Heller
has the record for dipping, having 22
to his credit. The chinning record is
21 times made by G. L. West, Engr.
'18; in this event three men are tied
for second place with 19 to their
credit. Stanley Scott’s broad jump
record was beaten by four inches when
J. L. Gray, Econ. '18, jumped 18 feet
5' inches. G. G. Boggs holds the
potato race record at 36 and 2-5
seconds. W. A. Powers with 8 feet 10
inches has the best mark in the ring
vault.- A. L. Burkston has hurled the
10 pound medicine ball 37 feet 9
inches, beating last years record by
six inches.

INTER-SCHOOL GAMES
TO BE SCHEDULED.

.—__u

A welcome announcement and one
that is a step in the right direction is
the word given out by the athletic
authorities that plans forsa regular
schedule of inten-school basketball will
be run next year. The plan is to have
a team from each of the schoolson the
campus and to run from two to four
games every week. The team with
the highest percentage at the -end of
the year will be awarded the cham-
pionship of .the University. Four of
the schools had teams this year, but
no deﬁnite schedule was attempted.

’The need of some Way by which
more students could participate in ath-
letics has been recognized, not only
here but also at many of the large
institutions throughout the country.
The facilities here for baseball and
football are so limited that no ad-
vance can be made along these lines
of sports. The movement for secur-
ing tennis courts, it is hoped, will
partly _aid in interesting the students.
There is a larger number of students
interested in athletics than is gener-
ally supposéd, as the minor sports
attract a large number besides those
engaged in the major sports. Last
year over 400 students participated in
some form of sports. This seems a
large number but is really a very
small percentage when considering the

. total enrollment. This plan of having

inter-school basketball games should
prove a means of attracting more men.
Tlurther announcement will be made
ater.

SWIMMING MEET

Lnoxms ’EM OVER

Last week and the next two weeks
are certainly lean ones in the number
of sporting events here at the Uni.
However the true fan is patiently
awaiting the call of Play Ball and
the crack of the starters pistol.

._..Q._..

We might be prejudiced but when
we lamped the players that were
cavorting around on Trees stadium
yesterday they looked as good as
Uncle Sam’s non-taxable bonds.

Peck, at ﬁrst,
second, “Pink” Healey,
short, and “Jimmy” De Hart, third.
But you never can tell. J. Arthur
was_betting 10 to 6 on himself.

There is some talk at the Track
house of matching “Jock” Sutherland
against the new champion from Kan-
sas, but it was doubtful if the new
champ would take a chance so soon.
Some one asked Peck why he did not
challenge him. Bob said he would, but
he was afraid the darn fool would
accept it.

.—°'*

The teams to be met at the Penn
relays are among the best in the land,
but with such men as Burwell, Mays,
Carothers, De Hart, K. C. Morrow,
Irvine and Thomas we should be able
to make them all hustle. That is
providing the men ‘get out and prac-
tice faithfully.

,—-O-- .

The meet with Syracuse is only four
weeks off. This is the ﬁrst meet of
this kind to be held between the two
schools. A good showing in these
contests will mean much for-the rep-
utation of the Uni in those parts.

They are raising quite a fuss up at
Bucknell over the election of a pro-
fessional baseball player to the cap-
taincy of the football team. Whether
he lived up to_ the rules of the Penn-
sylvania colleges in this respect or
not we do not know. But the farther
a school keeps away from the taint of
professionalism the better for the
sports in that institution.

The Athletic authorities announced
that there would be events for girls in
the inter-scholastic swimming meet
next week. Come early and avoid the
rush. Telescopes, ﬁeld and opera
glasses barred.

Coach Reinecke has, the right idea
when he advocates continual practice
for wrestlers. A man can not get into
shape and do his best in a few weeks
time. No one knows this better than
the popular. coach himself, who has
met the best in the business.

Tomorrow night next years basket-

In answer to the wishes of the stud-

year. ~

“Langdon too much for Penn State,”
“Langdon downs W. & J.,” these old
familiar headings will probably be in
style again soon: The big southpaw

.from Altoona reported in ﬁne shape

and with the team that he will have
back of him should make a wonderful
showing this year. But in the mean-
while we must not forget “Shorty”
Riehl. He pitched excellent ball last
year and the year before he was the
one to come to the rescue when one of
the _pitchers Pitt depended on failed
them.

By request Captain Norman Och-
senhirt will render his original, copy-
righted, Made in Germany, yodel, in
chapel, Friday, immediately after the
preseirtation of the championship cup.
Although Made in Germany the yodel
is a native product of Switzerland and
strict neutrality will be preserved
throughout the period. This is posi-
tively the last chance to hear that far
famed ditty, and no one should miss it..

bronze medals will be awarded in in-
dividual events and a silver cup to the
winning relay team. A new feature
this year will be the 40 yard race for
girls. This is the ﬁrst time that there
has been an event for the gentle sex,
and it has been included by requests
from three of the local schools.

Entries are being received from all
the local high and preparatory schools
and from many of the other schools
in this district. Last year’s events
were all hotly contested. The most
exciting one was the 160 yard relay
in which Born, swimming for Pea-
body high, beat out the Sewickley man
in the last few yards. Taylor, of
Allegheny Prep, lowered the 80 ‘yard
four style race’ and also the 40 yard
backstroke. The events this year in-
clude the 40 yard, free style, 100
yard free style, 80 yard medley race,
40 yard breast stroke, 40 yard back-
stroke, 160 yard relay race, 40 yard
race for girls, pliunge for distance,
and the fancy diving contest.

The University swimming champion-
ships will ‘be decided the same even-
ing. The 100 yard was held two
weeks ago and was won by Swope.
The events for these championships
will include a 40 yard novice race,
40 yard open, 200 yard open, 40 yard
back-stroke and the plunge. Last
year Swope lowered both the 100 and
200 yard records and McDiarmid
broke the former plunge record by
one foot .. I ‘  ‘ ‘ '. .

loving cup mounted upon a carved
ebony base and has the score of the

state. The retiring captain, Norman

The winning of the
championship of the state is a big
thing and as no celebration has been
held to commemorate it, it was
thought that some public presentation
of it should be -made. What the team
accomplished this year is too well
known by the students to need repeat-
ing. ‘Sufficient to say -that the team
this year has made the best record
that any basketball team that has

‘represented the institution.

Tomorrow night last season’s man-
ager, H. S. Downing, is giving a ban-
quet to the members of the team. At
this supper next «year’s captain will
be elected. The announcement of the
result of this ballot will be made at
the time of the presentation of the
cup. Of the eight men on this year’s
squad six will be back next year. With

NOTICE.

Attention is called to the ne-
cessity of medical examinations
and signed eligibility cards for
all men engaging in athletics.
These rules must~positively be
complied with, before any stud-
ent can represent the University
in any branch of athletics. This
matter should be attended to
at once.

FRESHMEN NINE
HAVE HARD GAMES.

 

The Freshman baseball nine willbe
called upon to meet someiof the best
teams in this part of the state—ac-
cording to the schedule arranged by
their manager. J. Steele Gow. The
schedule will include not more than
twelve games as the ones that have
been signed tup so far are of such
teams as Kiski, East Liberty
Academy and Indiana Normal. Trips
will be made to New Castle, Indiana
and Kiski. Due to the excess of Var-
sity material in school this year the
Freshmen should have a team that
should hold up the records set up by
those in previous seasons.

It is desired that as many men as
possible should come out for the team
as every position is open and noman
has any place cinched. Coach Am-
mons is not one to judge a man by his
past “rep,” and each candidate will be
judged on the stuff he shows. The
schedule as prepared this year is the
most pretentious that has ever been
arranged for the ﬁrst year men. The

-experience that they secure this year

will be valuable when next year’s Var-

sity call is given. The schedule
follows:—- _

April 21-Peabody H. S. at Peabody.
April 24--Kiski . . . . . . . .at Saltsburg.

May 1—Indiana Normal. .at Indiana.

WRESTLING COACH

A new plan for keeping the Var-
sity wrestlers in condition and of ex-
periencing new men for next year’s
team is being tried out this spring.
The failure to secure a coach for the
entire year has necessitated some
system by which the men can be kept
in good condition. The few months
time that. the wrestling coach has the
men under his direction is not enough
to enable him to turn out champion
wrestlers. When he takes charge of
the men either they are green at the
game or they are in no condition to
start strenuous work. Several weeks
of his time is thus wasted while the
men are training down.

The plan that isbeing worked out
is to have the members of this year’s
team act as instructors for the new
men. ' Two hours each week are spent
by all the men in wrestling. Gym-
nasium credit is given for the time
put in. A large number of men have
signiﬁed their intention to engage in
this, in preference to regular gym
work. This plan is now in force in
many of the larger schools were
wrestling is popular.

Ray Huff, Econ. ’16, has been ap-
pointed manager for next year’s team,
to succeed Ray Collins who acted both
in capacity of captain and manager
this year. The team this year was
only entered in two meets; the P. A.
A. and the Pitt-Penn State meets. An
extensive schedule is being arranged
for next year. Negotiations are now
on with Penn State, ‘University of
Pennsylvania, Navy, West Virginia
University, Cornell and one or two
other schools in the east. Washing-
ton and Jefferson -may have a team
next year and if so they will probably
be meet. Coach Reinecke is well
pleased with the material on hand and
hopes to improveait by the new system
now in operation.

TRACK CAND_IDATES
DO OUT DOOR WORK.

The advent of warm weather
marked the beginning of strenuous
work for the Varsity track team. The
Penn relays are only four weeks off
and the big dual -meet with Syracuse
there is only a week later. The im-
portance of these meets are not being
under estimated by the men and they
are getting down to real work. Most
of the men have been doing indoor
work and are in fair condition, but
they will have to be in much better
shape than.*they were at the last
meet at the Duquesne Gardens if -they
expect to make a respectable showing
in the next two meets.

Some of the trials for the Penn
relays will be held the latter part of
this week, but no deﬁnite selections
will be made until a few days before
the event. Besides the four men -in
the relay Pitt will probably send one
or two other men to represent the
school in some other contest. For the
relay Burwell, De Hart, Morrow, Mays,

Thomas, Carothers, Irvine and Canan.

are likely candidates with a possibil-
ity of one of the others beating them
out. The raising of Pitt to a higher
class will make it harder than in
previous years. At the present time

seems to be the best bet, as they have
been defeating all the teams they met
this year.

The dual meet with Syracuse marks
the ﬁrst time that a Pitt team has
gone so far to enter in a dual track
meet. The York State boys always

~ are strong in track and are exception-

ally well represented in all branches
of athletics this year. A win over
them would only be the more credit
to the victors. s

The later meets with Penn State,
Tech, Westminster and Washington
and Jefferson, although all hard meets
are not causing the coaches any
trouble. If they can make a creditable
showing in these two meets the others
can be taken care of easily.

CHANGES IN SYSTEM
. STILL GOING ON.

/"

With committees still working upon
the system, for counting _the credits
after the adoption of the new semes-
ter plan, and upon the changes to be!
made in the University curriculum at
the same time, the principal problems
involved in this new departure from
the rules of the past year have not
yet reached satisfactory solutions.
A Changes are being made, it is believed
in the present system of major and
minor subjects, that of electives, and
also of grouping in some of the de-
partments.
