Sexual awareness program forms

By Mike Hudson
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Concerned about naive
attitudes on campus, the Sexual
Aides program hopes to make
sex safer for students by providing
workshops geared toward risk
reduction.

“A lot of young people want to
think that, ‘This is never going to
happen to me, ”’ said Ollie Dreon,
_a member of the Sexual Aides
program. He described what he
saw as the attitudes of an
overwhelming number of Pitt
students toward sexually
transmitted diseases.

The 17—member volunteer
program, developed last year, is

a joint venture of. the Office of
Residence Life and the Student
Health Service.

According to Jan Devoe, a
health educator for the Student
Health Service, the program was
developed because there is a
need for risk-reduction education
at Pitt.

“Overall, we found Pittstudents
to be well-educated in regards to
pure. factual information about
sex, but they did need to learn
ways of changing behaviors that
put them at risk,” Devoe said.

The aides have developed an
hour—long presentation that
provides information about STDs,
date rape, contraception and the
role drugs and alcohol play in

risky sexual practices.

“We felt that students could be
an effective means for addressing
the problem of unsafe sex and
encouraging behavior change,”
Devoe said.

The AIDS issue is a big part of
the awareness ‘program, said
Mary—Alice Olsen, co—chairperson
of Sexual Aides.

“AIDS is here on campus, and
students should be aware of it,”
Olsen said.

According to Devoe, AIDS
cases have been reported on
campus, but the number is not
known because of the
confidential nature of the reports.

Devoe also said that cases of

Support group for Women ends

The Office of Continuing
Education for Women may
discontinue its informal coffee
gatherings that are offered for
women who are returning
students, according to director
Cynthia Vanda. A

The get—togethers are an outlet
for current, past and future
College of General Studies female
students to share their experiences
as returning students.

When the meetings blegan in

the 1989-90 academic year, two
were held each month. The
number was decreased this year
to six per term. The last one, on
Feb. 26, was attended by less
than a dozen women, Vanda said.

Vanda said this group of
students may be too busy to
participate in anything “informal.”

“They’re usually very busy
people. Education’s not their
primary activity. These people
are more practical, career-
oriented,” she said.

The office also recently planned
a few bag dinners at the William

Pitt Union which drew little
support. _,

the’ informal functions seemed tc
have some common concerns:
financial-aid questions and
uncertainty about which career

The off1ce’s job is to help the

  Expert says students rarely recognize aldoholabusee

Stat)“ Writer

When students think of substance abuse,
their first thoughts are often of cocaine,
amphetamines, crack or morphine. V

But according to one expert, they have
mistakenly omitted one of the most
potentially dangerous chemicals: alcohol.

According to Jeremiah McAuliffe,
substance abuse specialist at the Student
Health Service, alcohol is “a very serious
problem. It is the most dangerous drug,

probably, that we have.

“If it was discovered today, it would
never be legalized,” he said.

Alcohol on college campuses is a serious
problem, he said. “Alcohol use is much
higher in college than for the general
population,” said McAuliffe.

This in turn creates a problem for the
students themselves. According to- the
Office for Substance Abuse Prevention,
the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health
Administration and the United States
Department of Health and Human Services,

many students do not know about the
negative relationship between drinking
and academic performance.

McAu1iffe said the relationship between
alcohol and academic performance [is
“absolutely true.”

“Probably many of the freshmen that
don’t make-it that first year — it’s not
because they're dumb. It’s because they
were partying, and alcohol totally effects
the cognitive function," said McAuliffe.‘

There are a lot of mistaken beliefs
concerning what an alcohol problem is,

Pitt sponsors iclimcformnners .

according to McAuliffe.
“The big mistaken belief is tha-t- an

. alcohol problem is defined by how much

or how often you drink, and that’s not
true,” said McAuliffe. Alcohol abuse is if

‘ you have any negative consequences when

you drink. That can be getting sick, blowing
off class [or] doing things that you: later
regret.” 4 V’ 9

Many students do not feel that they are

1 A Hillman Library employee
has organized a display of
homosexual and bisexual
periodicals, novels, plays and

‘ newspaper clips located in the

special-collections section in the
third floor of the library.

“The display connotes an idea
of what happened in this culture
in the last 30 years to gays and
lesbians,” said Dave Sleasman.

‘ “It's for them to learn and develop
an idea of what they are as
’ minorities. ”

Sleasman said that he was asked
to do a display by members of the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, of which he is a member.
He then had the idea approved
by his boss, Charles Aston-

“It’s not for controversy’s sake,”
said Aston. “It is supposed to
represent the development of
literature in the gay and lesbian
world over the past 30 years.”

The collection that Sleasman
put together consists of several
glass display cases, one at the

“Dave did an: excellent job,

“Our primary concern was that
we make sure that the exhibit
was equally distributed between
gays and lesbians. Both groups

Most students seemed to agree.

NETAC develops environmental safety technology  

By Margaret Swisher
Stajf Writer

(Editor's note: This is tbefomtb
segment of a ﬁve part series of the
Pitt Trust.)

When the Exxon Valdez oil
spill contaminated Alaskan
beaches, the National Environ-
mental Technology Applications
Corporation recommended two
bioremediation treatments to
clean up the spill.

NET AC, one of the five entities
in the University of Pittsburgh

Trust, works with the
Environmental Protection Agency
to accelerate commercialization
of environmental technologies,
such as bioremediation treat-
merits.

"The bioremediation treatment
consists of reproducing oil—eating
bugs, who pass the oil through

their bodies as carbon dioxide

and water.

NETAC was set up by a
cooperative agreement between
the University of Pittsburgh and
the EPA. The EPA will contribute

$4.5 million to NETAC over the
next four years. NETAC is also
expected to contribute the same
amount back to the EPA.

“Our budget today is $2.8
million, so as you can see it is
almost a two—to-one catch—up,”
said Edgar Berkey, president of
NETAC. “We are generating those
funds from industry foundations
and state and local government
sources.”

NETAC has many functions,
one of which is to identify the
need of new environmental

technologies. Berkey said, “We
will contact the EPA and tell them
this is needed. Sometimes they
say, ‘Great,’ or ‘No.’ Sometimes
they will come and say they will
do it for us.”

NETAC also advises industrial

companies in the United States. '

“Any manufacturing process
involves some generation of solid
or hazardous waste. So con-
ceivably, every industrial com-

pany in the United States is a po-

tential client for better environ— '

mental technologies,” ‘said
Berkey. “So NETAC was also
established to make sure com-
panies have access to the best
ideas and technologies to control
the pollution that is being
created.” _

Now, many of these women

Also, many of them have children

“That's a real frustrating, difficult

addressed the Pittsburgh job

“Students should be aware that
an HIV infection means that a

“The purpose of the Sexual

refer them to the Student Health
Service if they need further help
with a problem,” Olsen said.
The aides involve participants
in role-playing exercises after a
brief lecture period to see how
each person reacts in a given
scenario. The aides, acting as
coaches, then critique the person’s
behavior and offer suggestions
on how to avoid taking chances.
One of the benefits of role-
playing, Olsen said, is that the
participants get a better

understanding of how they
become involved in risky
situations.

Date rape is acted out through
role playing, Olsen said.

“Date rape is not an issue that
is just ‘hyped up.’ I do believe
that people would like to think
that. it is.  [Date rape] is
something that needs to be
brought out in the open,” Dreon
said.

“People don’t realize that [date
rape] is a form of rape,” Olsen

said. “A lot of times people give
each other mixed messages, but
the bottom line is, no means no!”
Olsen stressed that students
need to be aware of how drinking
causes date rape because the
judgment of both the man and
woman is impaired. '
“There are a lot of [date—rape]
occurrences on campus,” Devoe
said, “but usually there is nothing
done about it because people are
not willing to talk about it, and
the victims don’t want to report

it”

Although the program is still in .]

a formative stage, Olsen said she
plans to have Sexual Aides
recognized as a health advocate
on campus by the fall semester.
Olsen also said that volunteers
each receive 20 hours of
introductory training that teaches
them about STDS, contraceptive
devices and drug and alcohol

awareness.The aides also attend '

monthly training sessions to
update them on pertinent issues.

McAuliffe said that even if a
student only drinks a couple of
times a month he or she can still
be abusing alcohol.

“If you drink three or four

times a month, and two or three
of those times you get sick, do
something you regret — don’t
study, blow off class —— you’re
abusing alcohol. And that’s only

Made in the USA. may soon be, replaced by Hecho en
Mexico. - ‘ '

The United States, Canada and Mexico have recently
agreed in principle to a free-trade agreement, potentially
making all of North America a free trading zone. This
pact, made by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulrooney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, would allow both American and Canadian
corporations to move their operations to Mexico, making
them less susceptible to restrictions from both
environmentalists and labor unions. ‘

ix Labor unions -are virtually nonexistent in Mexico.

Therefore, one of their main exports is cheap labor. By
attracting large corporations into their country, Mexico
would be ableto boost its own economy, albeit in a
limited fashion, by providing jobs to its people. A

By moving their bases of production, major U.S.
corporations would be gleaning a huge profit from this
cheap labor. At the same time, American workers would
be losing their jobs, contributing to our own unemployment
rate. C \ ‘

Most economists, when asked, will say that this country
is in the middle of a recession. Unemployment is on the
rise, along with prices for goods and services. This
measure would only enhance those problems; as labor
moves south, wages here would be forced to decrease,
and American workers would suffer greatly.

This legislation would also permit companies to reduce .
prices at the cost of the "environment. Mexican

environmental policies are not nearly as stringent as

those in both the United States and Canada. By dropping
standards for protecting the environment, these major
corporations save more money.

The Environmental Protection Agency, a long—time

. adversary of these corporations, forces the U.S. government

to impose strict guidelines such as the Clean Air Act of
1990 upon companies, forcing them to cut back on the
production of substances proven to be harmful to the
environment.

Naturally, these improvements cost enormous amounts
of money. Mexico, which is not-a heavily industrialized
country, does not have the same strict environmental
legislation. As the “environmental president,” it would be
hypocritical‘ of Bush to give Mexico ‘this agreement
without some guarantees that the environment would be
protected as well. ’

Ironically, this proposed legislation comes at a time
when many are questioning the stability of our own
economy. Contrary to what President Bush says, this

agreement will not aid the economy; even if prices for

some goods might decrease, money to buy them would
be scarce because of a lack of jobs.

Free trade is one thing, but cheap goods should not
come at the expense of the environment and the loss of
American jobs. ‘

When it comes to modern art,
I’m a “live—and—let-live” kind of
guy. As long as no one forces me
to look at Day-Glo images of

their dog’s footprints, I don’t make '

fun of them.

Of course, nothing lasts forever.

This delicate relationship was
shattered last week when, as I
was leaving Hillman Library, I
saw a huge (96 x 120 centimeters,
to be exact) photograph in the
lobby that showed six women
clad in black. My first reaction
was that it was a blowup of a
Revlon ad. Boy, was I wrong.

In case you were wondering,
that photograph (and its duplicate
on the second ﬂoor) was taken
by local artist Lorraine -Vullo. In
the picture, she’s the one in the
middle in the first row. Anyway,
the folks over at the Carnegie
Museum_ decided they liked her
stuff, so. they commissioned her
to “do a piece.” (T hat’s artist talk

for “make something people-

could stare at and then make
pithy comments like, ‘My, how
Kaﬂ<a_-esque.”’) _

At this point you’re probably
wondering why, if ..the thing" is

The Carnegie’s fault, it’s in the

Hillman Library instead. Well, you
see, the Hillman Foundation
footed the bill for it. So The
Carnegie owns it, but the Henry
L. Hillman Foundation paid for it.
Naturally, since the foundation
paid for it, it also decided where
it goes, and what better place
than a college library? I could
give them a few suggestions.
That’s the story on how the
thing got there in the first place.
Don’t ask me for any more details.
I can’t get them. I couldn’t even
tell you who could. I asked about
five or six people who work at
the library and found most of

_ Adam   
Richter

them to be almost as clueless as
I am. Apparently The Carnegie
was supposed to give the library
staff _ some background
information‘ on those elusive
photographs, but it hasn’t‘gotten
there yet.

The people at The Carnegie
weren't much help, either. Not to
criticize them, but they seemed
to know about as much about the
pictures as the people at Hillman
Library did. I think the biggest
attraction of the pictures is that
no one knows anything about
them. ‘

So, if you go to the library and
ask a staff member about the
picture, you’ll probably get, “Your
guess is as good as mine” for an
answer. -

Now, I'm the first to admit I
know only slightly more about
art than I do about quantum
mechanics, and I_ care about it
less. Still, I can’t grasp the point
of those pictures, except maybe
to cover up huge expanses of
blank wall space. Personally, I
never saw anything wrong with
huge expanses of blank wall
space. .

The worst thing about the
picture (by the way, it’s untitled)
is that it shows anyone with a
Kodak disposable 35mm camera
can pass as an artist. I wish I had
known this before. I could have
taken advantage of all those badly
cropped, out—of-focus snapshots
I took with my 110 when I was a
kid.

‘It isn’t all bad, though. One
interesting thing about the exhibit

really ‘art?’

(besides the fact that it is
apparently permanent) has got

to be those stand—up cutouts on ,

the second ﬂoor. When I first saw

it from a distance, I thought they ., _
actually were three people

observing the picture the way
pretentious art people do. Much
to my relief, though, I discovered
they were fake (although this
doesn't rule out my first
impression). Of course they
couldn’t be real. Who do you

know that would spend time’

consciously observing somethin g
like that photograph?

Of course, the simple way to
avoid Ms. Vullo’s work is not to

go to the library. But for those of ' J

us who can’t avoid going, we will
be forced to live with it. The least
they could do is give the picture
a title. How about “35m Tax
Write-Off?”

My only comfort out of this is

knowing that the Student-

Government Board — you know,
the one behind the neon sculpture
in the student union, some bench
on Fifth Avenue and T elefact —
wasn’t responsible for the new

Hillman exhibit. In fact, it wasn’t A

even the university. The new
“art” in the library is the fault of
the Henry L. Hillman Foundation,
so don’t look for another tuition
hike in next year's bill — not for
this thing, anyway. .

I don’t know. Call me skeptical,
but I just don’t see the point in the
Hillman Foundation's decision to
donate those pictures. For Pete’s

sake, if they wanted to donate a ,

work of art, why not something
everyone could appreciate? They
could donate something like a
neon sculpture of Wes Posvar.

“I walk in the banquet, and there
is my mother sitting there," said
Lantagne. ‘

The evening was highlighted
by the Blue—Gold Awards given

The Lady Panther gymnastics
team ended its season with a
strong showing at the NCAA
Regionals in Lundholrn Gym at
the University of New Hampshire
by placing ﬁfth with a score of
186.725 last weekend.

During the competition, the
Pitt squad held true to the level of
performance that it has

demonstrated throughout the
season. The Lady Panthers added

Panthers and the Hurricanes were
joined by athletes from George
Mason University, the University
of Miarni-Dade, Eastern Kentucky
University, the University Central
Florida and Florida International
University.‘

“The guys went down there
and did a great job,” head coach
John Vasvary said. “When you
can qualify this early in the
season, it’s just a super
performance. They are already
ahead of the point that I expected
them to be at this time of the
season.” _

Senior Elbert Ellis led the squad
in the 110- and 400-meter hurdle
events. In the 110m, Ellis crossed

the line first with a time of 13.89
seconds’, a good enough finish
to be a provisional qualifier in
the NCAA Championships.
Coming in second was teammate
Brett Shields with a time of 13.95,
joining Ellis as a provisional
qualifier. The outright national
qualifying time is 13.72 seconds.
The provisional qualifiers are put
on a list infdescending order and
will participate in the
championships if there are less
than 24 competitors in the event.

“Elbert and Brett will probably
make itwith those times,” Vasvary
said. “They will still improve on
their times as the season goes on.
They both certainly push each

other, and that’s what you want. ”

In the 400m, Ellis again took
first place, ﬁnishing with a 51.93,
qualifying him for the IC4As in
the event. Teammates Franz
Jobson (52.97) and Shields (53.80)
came in second and third,
respectively, and will join Ellis at
the IC4As.

The men’s relay team of Ellis,
Shields,Jobson and Brian Whitley
took the opportunity and
qualified for the IC4As in the
4x100- and 4x400-meter relay
events.

bests, as well as tying one of the
school’s records. Two gymnasts
placed in the top 10. Jeannie
Vecchio won first place on the
uneven parallel bars with a score
of 9.725, and Tina Taylor took
fourth place in the floor exercise
with a score of 9.80.

At this year’s competition,
Vecchio was named regional bars
champion. She held this honor
three years ago. Vecchio and
Taylor also received All-North
East Honors.

“They looked like competitors, "
said Coach Debbie Yohman.
“They just went out there and
worked. Some of the mistakes
were from working too hard, but
we learn from that.”

The Lady Panthers opened the
competition with what has been
their strongest event all season:
the ﬂoor exercise. The team
handed in strong performances
and earned a 47.50, the second-
highest team ﬂoor score of the
evening.

But they still had a few

grass, the tart taste of iced
lemonade under a shaded
tree. And, of course,
baseball.

A baseball fan since birth,
I was delighted when I was
asked to offer my insightful
perspective on this year’s
American League East race.

Not feeling too confident

in my baseball knowledge,

however, -I called my old
friend Scooter, a wizened
baseball fan of many a
summer, to assist in the
task.

“I'd be glad to help,” said
Scooter. “How may I be of
service?” _

“Well,” I said, sheepishly,

“I guess the first thing I

need to know is what team
should be favored to win
the AL East this year.”

“Oh, that’s easy,” said
Scooter, a self-proclaimed »
baseball connoisseur. “The
Boston Red Sox. The boys
from Beantown won it last
year and have taken three
pennants in the last five
years."

“But what makes them
so special this year?” I asked.

“Well, the Bosox won 88
games last year with a
pitching rotation that
included Greg Harris, Dana
Kiecker and T om Bolton.”

“Who?” ‘

“Exactly. But this year
they’ve added veterans
Danny Darwin and Matt
Young to the rotation, along
with designated hitter Jack
Clark, to a lineup already
laden with more beef than
a Ruth's Chris filet mignon. "

“Say, don’t the Red Sox
also have that guy who’ll
make more money than
IBM this year?”

' “Yes, that’s Roger
Clemens. He went 21-6 last
year with a 1.93 ERA. And

‘sometimes his fastball is

even faster than his mouth. ”
“Wow. And don’t they
have that guy who eats
chicken every day and falls
out of moving cars?” v ,
“That’s Wade Boggs. He

a time of 41.41 seconds. It came
back in the 4x400 to take second
place with a time of 3:11.78.

The injury problems that
plagued the team late in the
indoor season are starting to
smooth out.

“We still have some athletes

with nagging injuries,” Vasvary
said, “but not as many as during
the indoor season. They are
coming back and picking up
where they left off and doing an
excellent job. ”

One of the vital athletes on the
injured list is steeplechase
specialist T om Swartout, who is

out with a nagging calf injury.

“Tom just can’t seem to shake
that problem,” Vasvary said, “but
the medical staff will keep
working on it and see how soon
he can be back.”

Next up for the Panthers is the
Dogwood Relays at the University

of Tennessee next weekend.

The event attracts_teams from
the Big 10, Atlantic Coast
Conference and other Big East
squads.

West Virginia University and
Penn State University will also be
joining the field.

East

Continued from page 8

slipped to .302 last year but
promises to bat..36S this year -
and wear his seat belt every day.”

“OK, good. Are there any teams
that will challenge the Red Sox
this year?”

“Only one. The Toronto Blue
Jays. But the problem with the
Blue Jays is that they always
seem to have the best talent but
don’t do anything with it. Sort of
like Paul McCartney.”

“Have they improved
themselves over the winter?”

“They think they have but not

» really. They got Joe Carter (.232,

24 HRs) but gave up Fred McGriff.
They got Roberto Alomar (.287,
24 SBs) but gave up Tony
Fernandez (.276, 26 SBs), and
they got Devon White (.217, 11
HRS) but gave up George Bell
(.265, 21 HRs)..”

“I see. Well, what other teams
are there in the AL East anyway?”

“There's the Baltimore
Orioles.”

“How will they do?”

’ “Well, Jeff Ballard, their
Opening—day pitcher, was 2-11
last year.”

“Yeah, but didn't they pick up
former Astro Glenn Davis over
the winter?”

“Yes, their lineup is OK. They I I
still have the Ripken boys and I
Randy Milligan, and they picked

up Dwight Evans, but their
pitching staff still has about as
much depth as a Jackie Collins
novel."

“How about ‘the New York
Yankees? How will they do?”

“Y’know, the Yankees are no "

fun anymore. In a couple of years
they may even have a winning
season again.”

“How about the Cleveland
Indians?"

“The Indians could be the worst
team in American League history.
Their top outﬁelders are Chris
James, Alex Cole and Turner
Ward.”

“Yeah, but don't they have
Albert Belle, the guy who hit 11
homers during spring training?
He’s getting lots of ink this year
as the next Cecil Fielder.”

“Belle, Schmelle. This team

couldn't play its way out of a

paper bag.” ,
“Well, what about Fielder and
his Detroit Tigers’ teammates?”
“The Tigers have Alan
Trammell, Lou Whitaker and more

castaways than ‘Gilligan's Island.’ ~ '

Every _other starter came over
from another organization. This
team is in worse shape than Iraq's
Republican Guard.” ‘ '

“Hmmm, that's too bad. I-low 

about the Milwaukee Brewers?”

“The Brewers are not good.
They never have been, and they
never will be. They had one
lucky season in 1982..”

“They still have Robin Yount, I

don’t they?”

“Yes, but, believe it or not, he’s
getting old. He’s 35 years old
now, even though he's "been
playing for Milwaukee since 1974,
and he only batted .247 last year.
They also traded away Dave
Parker (.289, 21 HRS, 92 RBIs),
their best player last year. The
Brewers should bring back Larry
Hisle and Gorman Thomas if they
want any kind of chance."

 

Seniors

Continued from page 8

by club President Robert Lovett,
a former basketball player. Pitt
Director of Development for
Athletics Michael O'Brien
announced that the senior athletes
would also receive one year’s
free membership in the Golden
Panthers.

Of 73 athletes graduating, 23
made the University Scholar-

-Athlete All-Academic Team,

which includes all athletes who
graduate with an overall quality-
point ‘average of 3.0 or better.
Bozik, who announced the team
with John Bolvin, dean of the
College of General Studies, said
of the group, “I wantyou to listen

TITLE: PROSPECTS IN LAW:
AVIEW FROM THE BENCH AND BAR

DATE: Wednesday, April 10, 1991
TIME: 4-5230 p.m
PLACE: W.P.U. Assembly Room

Several prominent figures from
Pittsburgh’s legal community will
speak on issues related to the
profession. Everyone welcome.
Refreshments will be served.

to these majors. There are not a
bunch of basketweaving majors
here.” The list included tennis
players Jeff Mills and Terry
O’Conner, who have both been
accepted into law school. Mills
made the dean’s list every term at
Pitt.

The list included Lantagne and
Dudley, who also received two
of the four Big East Post—Graduate
Scholarship Awards. Other
athletes honored for awards were
Pitt’s four senior All-Americans:
punter Brian Greenfield, Demas
for the 400m dash, Elbert Ellis for
the 55m hurdles and Keith
Dowling for cross country and
the 5,000m event in indoor track.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, April 10, 1991

  

Gym
Continued from page 8
' The second leg of the
competition found the Lady
Panthers working the vault. The
squad performed its vaults very
cleanly with only a few
problems, scoring a 46.55.
Strong vaults came from
Carnesale (9.50), Taylor (9.30),
Venezia (9.30), Vecchio (9.25),
Kristin Brown (9.20) and Kathy
Wallish (9.20). ‘
The Lady Panthers turned in
strong bar performances but
again experienced some
trouble. Taylor missed a
direction change in her routine

and lost bonus points.

Carnesale cast too hard for her
handstand and went right over
the bar. But in the true spirit of
this team, the bar squad was able
to score a 46.65.

High scores for Pitt on the bars
came from Vecchio (9.725),
Brown (9.425), Jorgensen (9.30),
Wallish (9.20) and Taylor (8.975).

The Lady Panthers ended the
competition on what has been
their most inconsistent event: the
balance beam. This season the
team has been experiencing a
great deal of difficulty staying on
the beam. During regionals, the
team fell four times and scored a

V 46.025.

“How do you predict that?”
asked Yohman. “The kids had
superb beam workouts the past
two weeks. lt’s awful hard to

go in there and know what '

you have to do, and do it last
on beam.”

Strong beam workouts came
from Venezia (9.475),
Carnesale (9.45), Brown (9.10),
Taylor (9.10), Vecchio (8.90)
and Wallish (8.90).

PITT BITS: Scoring their‘

career—high scores last
weekend were Tina Taylor,
Karen Jorgensen, Jeannie
Vecchio, and Carrie Carnesale.
