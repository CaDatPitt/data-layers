Job Market Draws From

Engineer, Health Fields

By NOLA WERNER
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

The engineering and health field
graduates_of 1980 will find the job
market wide open for their skills,
according to Daniel Nagy, director
of student placement. However
liberal arts graduates will be hit
harder by the recession.

Engineering graduates are in the
greatest ‘demand with 99 percent of
all who use the Placement Off1ce’s
services being placed.

“The one percent that are not
placed is probably because they
don’t want to be,” said Nagy.

Graduates from the health field,
nurses, pharmacists, and medical
technicians are also doing well as in
past years with a placement rate of
99 percent. A

The predicted placement rate for
science and technology graduates is
88 percent based on the placement
statistics tabulated last fall, explain-
ed Nagy.

“This year’s tech graduates will
hold their own.” Liberal arts
graduates are up against a tighter
job market and “that is why there
has been a real rush by non-tech
students to get into MBA school
and get business courses” according
to Nagy.

The liberal arts graduate has to
be taught “where the jobs are and
how to pursue the market.” They
have a placement rate of 75 percent,
but the students often lack proper
“motivation” because of
discouraging “rumors” that there

are no jobs available, explained
Nagy.

“We gear them up on how to
search for a job, how to get their
foot in the door and pry it open.
The person "who is more aggressive
and competitive will get the job.”

The Placement Office arranged
12,000 personal interviews between
students and representatives of 670

companies lastwyearg. This year the V

office’s order books for on-campus
recruiting visits were ﬁlled earlier
than last year despite the recession.

Nagy predicted this year to be
either “a feast or famine year.”
Problems could arise from the cut-
backs in the steel and auto in-
dustries since U.S. Steel was the se-
cond largest employer of last year’s
graduates and Generral Motors was
the third largest.‘

“Computers, - electronics,
aerospace and defense contractors
will be booming” however, and

number one employer of last year’s

The eight year series of attempts
to convert Pitt's WPGH Radio into
an FM educational station neared

"completion last Monday, June 16,
when a license application was sub-
mitted to the Federal Communica-
tions Commission on the final day
for filing an application which
challenges another college radio sta-
tion for FM airspace.

WRCT, the educational FM sta— .

tion at Carnegie-Mellon University,
decided not only to remain on an
FM channel potentially available to
Pitt, but also applied-to increase
their power to 100-watts. The FCC
reviewed the technical parts of
WRCTs application and designated
June 16 as the deadline for Pitt to
submit the challenging application.

Former WPGH General Manager
Jeff Couch hand-delivered the ap-
plication to the FCC office in
Washington. Couch has been a
paid consultant to the university in
completing the application and is
the author of the original Fall, 1977
FM proposal.

some time in the end of July.

_The former director, Dr. Joanne
Robinson, after a leave of absence
granted in late October, ‘resigned at

Conflict With CMU

From the results of a frequency
search conducted two years ago by
Educational FM Associates, a
private engineering consultant firm
based in Duxbury, Massachusetts,
the only FM channels potentially
available to .Pitt in this area are: ‘
-88.1 MHz, 88.3 MHz, and 88.7
MHz. However, all of these fre-
quencies are impacted by WRCT,
operated by CMU on .88.3 as a
10-watt (Class D) facility. '

“The FCC has certain frequency
allocations that they make, and
sometimes when they’re made in-
itially they’re made on what’s called
a demand basis. That means it’s
first come first serve. They get to
keep it regardless of what frequency
they’re on,” said Edward Perry of
Educational FM Associates.

According to Perry, this is not
the “most efficient way” to allocate
frequencies because, “one station
can tie up more channels than it
needs to.”

'In the case of WRCT, they are
located at 88.3 MHz, and that ties
up 88.1 through 88.7 MHz.
“Basically, the conflict is that

now it only accomodates one and
there isn't much Pitt can do about
it,” Perry said.

Hoping WRCT would agree to
“relinquish” their facilityin favor
of Pitt, Educational FM Associates
went ahead in preparing an
engineering exhibit in 1978 to sup-
port WPGH’s application for 900

watts on 88.3. Engineering exhibits ,

are included in any FCC application
and include such data as antenna
andsite information, facilities re-
quested, and potential impact on
other stations. ‘ J _
However, WRCT continued to
operate and decided to increase
their power to 100 watts.
According to an informed source
at Pitt, “an engineer on WRCTs ex-
ecutive board advised WPGH in
1978 that rather than increasing
WRCTs power to 100 watts as man-

dated by a recent FCC ruling, the '

station (WRCT) would shutdown

because of a lack of funds to make -

the power increase.”

The newly created position of
program coordinator of the Pitt
Program Council (PPC) has
been ﬁlled by a University of
Rhode Island graduate.

Henry Morris, who joined the
PPC staff June 2, is responsible
for picking I up the duties
previously handled by a part-
time program assistant in addi-
tion to sharing duties with PPC
advisor Joyce Giangarlo.

Sue Warden, the former pro-
gram assistant, left Pitt to take a
position at the Community Col-
lege of Allegheny County.

PPC, formerly known as the
Pitt Union Program Council, is
responsible for coordinating all
programming for non-College
of General Studies
undergraduate students.

There are nine programing

areas under the PPC: concerts,
entertainment, lectures, recrea-
tion, films, homecomming ac-
tivities, technical productions,
cultural arts, and video. Morris
and Giangarlo will split eight of
these duties and share in the
planning of Pitt’s homecoming
activities.

Individual committees con-
sisting of undergraduate
students will be responsible for
coordinating ‘each program
area.

The constitution governing
PPC has recently been revised to
include a board of governors.

One executive student board
will be comprised of the nine
chairpersons of PPC commit- .
tees, who will be responsible for
reviewing and evaluating pro-
grams and budgets, and appoin-
ting the student coordinator.

The second board will include

three students chosen by the
Student Government Board,
two students and one faculty
member appointed by the vice
chancellor for student affairs,
two ‘students chosen by PPC,
and one alumni member ap-
pointed by the chancellor. The
second board'will be responsible
for approving funding‘alloca-
tions to the various committees
and overseeing PPC activities.

Morris views the new con-
stitution as “moving in the right
direction.”

Another change mandated by
the new constitution is the name
change from Pitt Union Pro-
gram Council to its present title
to “reflect the campus-wide
scope PPC intends, rather than
only union bound as the name
previously implied,” Morris
said.

Tuning In On WPGH

The student operators of WPGH and Pitt’s
administration have just completed a.long, tedious
process only to begin another in pursuit of an FM
educational radio station. license.

Last week, an application for a new FM facility

A was hand-delivered‘ to the Federal Communications

I Commission on the final day it could be filed. Now,
the students and administrators who are personally
committed to the project must wait a maximum of six
months for the federal bureaucratic process to take
its course. Within half a year, Pitt will know whether
or" not it can begin construction of the proposed sta-
tion. ‘ . \

Although the application must still be scrutinized

, investment.

by the federal bureaucracy, the proposal to establish

the station has already passed through the redtape of -
the university administration. It took months of prod- -

ding and politicking to convince -the Student
Government Board and the university senior staff
that an FM facility would be well worth the capital
Once the administration and student
leaders saw the advantages of building an FM sta-

tion, the project received a stampiof approval.
An overview of the proposed station—the endorse-

ment of the original proposal by SGB, the monetary
commitment by the university administration, and

the countless hours spent pouring Over -technical and '

legal information—shows that persistence pays off.
If approved by the FCC, a project that started as a
dream will become a reality. '

The construction of an FM educational radio sta- -

tion will provide a new dimension to the unive sity.
Not only will theuniversity reap the benefits of ered
by an “open-air” station, but the Allegheny County

community will also be the recipients‘ ofa fine public _, 4 I

  

service. - . --  
The proposed‘ programming format was designed',,..  

to meet the needs of ‘the station’s potentiallistening .

audience, determined through interviews and" ran-
dom surveys with community leaders and others. The

‘proposed programming format will include: hourly] I,
news broadcasts, in-depth analysis of current events,;:

advice on economic problems and personal finance;
“speak-out” messages, a wide variety of musical‘
shows, radio serials, and ot,her_programs.

‘ If approved by the FCC, the new station will also§,i:‘.l-"-  f 

providea valuable experience for students iriterestedi 

in the communications field.

We hope that the FCC approves the license ap-l - it

plication because of the public service it will provide

to the university and Allegheny County commun.itie‘s. '

Also, we commend the university administrators and
students who took a personal interest in the FM pro-_“

  CoIumn/   The Baylor Bill Of Rights

ject, and supported it through thick and thin.

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free ex-
ercise thereof; or abridging the
freedom of speech or the press; or
the right of the people peaceably to
assemble and to petition the
Government for a redress‘ of
grievances. .

The first Article of the Bill of

Rights as printed above does not
apply to private schools in regard to

freedom of the press. A controver-'

sial issue which has drawn national
publicity developed last January at
Baylor University in Waco, Texas,
which proves the latter. 

Baylor University is to Southern
Baptists what Notre Dame. is‘ to
Catholics. It is the most prestigious
of the seven schools supported by
the Baptist General Convention of
Texas. The recent fiasco between
the student newspaper, the Lariat,

and the university’s president,»

Abner V. McCall, has developed a

I situation whereby the First Amend-

ment of the Constitution has come

into conflict with itself.

It ‘all began last winter when.
Playboy Magazine announced that
it would be coming to Baylor to
photograph Baylor ' coeds for a
September issue displaying “Girls
of the Southwest Conference.”
Within two months a vast enough
controversy had evolved that all
three editors of the newspaper were
fired, most of the newspaper staff
resigned, two 'members of the
Baylor journalism faculty resigned,

and scholarships from several stu-

dent staff members of the paper
were revoked by. the school’s ad-
ministration. . i

The paper at first simply ran a
story announcing the upcoming
Playboy visit.- ‘Editorials followed
in‘ which the paper’s sditors sug-
gested that the question to pose or
not to pose should be left up to the
individual Baylor coed. President
McCall had announced that any
coed posing for the magazine would
be subject to disciplinary action.
Once the president read the articles
and editorialsjwhich he believed to
be contrary to his edict, he ordered

. adviser

the paper‘ to cease printing stories
he considered promotional for

Playboy. According to anarticle in '

The Quill, the magazine for jour-
nalists, McCall said, as chief ex-
ecutive, he would determine policies
for the student newspaper. ‘He
issued a four-page statement
reiterating his position and _stating
his belief that the editorials were de-
nying the basic tenets of the Chris-
tian faith. That statement included
McCall’s assertion that hewas‘ ac-
ting aspublisher of the paper and
was , entitled‘ to determine what
would and what, would not be
printed. I 3 '
The chairman of the journalism

department, to add coal to the tire, _
‘sent a letter to the‘ paper’s faculty

adviser instructing him to order
students to submit editorials to the
in advance for review.
“This is not a suggestion,” the let-
ter stated. ,“It is a direct order.”
The weeks that followed saw the

. issue become a national news story,

the three student editors were fired
by the school’s publications board,

and the Lariat temporarily ceased

Leh‘er/ In Defense Ronald Reagar_1_

I just received my May 22 issue. of

The Pitt News (it’s customarily "

three weeks late) and couldn't help
but notice a column by Cindy
Cohen, entitled, “Reagan and
Carter in November. . .'Anderson
the Underdog.”

After reading the column I was
amazed that a responsible student
publication, like The Pitt News,
would permit such a crude attempt
at editorial journalism to be

’ published.

The author of the column makes
a very crude’ attempt to attack
Republican presidential candidate
Ronald Reagan, and to a lesser
degree President Carter, and to pro-
mote Independent presidential can-
didate John Anderson.

The author dwells on the fact that
Reagan was an actor, as if it shows
a lack of intelligence. I say, so
what? Being an actor does not
make one unqualified to, be presi-
dent. Why should the press have a
field day as the‘ author claims?

News anchormen are actors in 4.1"’
way also. ’ I also find most
ridiculous the author's comment
that she wonders if a President
Reagan would pre-efnpt a movie of
himself in case of a nuclear attack.
That's a pretty ridiculous" comment
to make, isn3t_ it? ‘

The author also attacks Reag‘an’s/

, alleged lack of experience, par-
" ticularly in foreign policy. I wonder

if the author has taken any__time to

' research his record as governor of

I

California and his statements‘ as a
candidate. Reagan spent ‘eight
years as governor of California.

' (which:if it were it’s own country,
‘ would rank among the top ten) and

by most people's estimation he did
an excellent job. ‘While governor he
signed into law some of I the '
toughest anti-po1l_ution_ laws. He
also left California with a very’ large"
budget, surplus and reformed. the
welfare system to increase
assistance to ‘the truly needy. If
elected President I am sure Reagan

.In cross-over primary states like

fact, Reagan himself is a former

process. His avowed purpose is not
to win the election or to articulate a
particular ideological viewpoint,
but to deny the major party can-

is a tragic attempt by a man who
lacks a base of support in his own
party to make himself a Presidential
Kingmaker and possibly deny the
candidate, who was the choice of a

plurality of voters, the White

lack of judgement.

Festival Soars Despite Rain

By MYRLE KAYE

Music, fluttering banners, and colorful
crowds competed with rain, high winds
and battered artistry to set the tone for the
twenty-first Three Rivers Arts Festival.
The 10-day festival succeeded in bringing
the arts to the multitudes of Pittsburghers,
despite bad weather. Pittsburgh proclaim-
ed itself a joyous, thriving, creative com-
munity. capable of withstanding the stor-
miest weather.

The sprawling festival site encompassed
Gateway Center, Market Square, and Point
Park, and housed treasures for all the
senses. The ]u'ried Visual Arts Exhibition
and the Artists’ Market, the Main Stage and
the Inflatable, and the countless food
booths offered feasts of great variety.

Twenty-three pavilions displayed
photography, paintings, drawings, and
lithographs by names as strange to Pitts-
burgh as Bert Stephan Lustig and Carol
Pasch. Rebecca Parslow and David
Wyzenbeck, 1980 graduates of Pitt's studio
arts department, keptcompany with more
than 400 other fine artists and offered
names familiar to Pitt art supporters. The
open-air gallery created by the pavilions

was the backbone of the festival, touching a
wide range of media and artists.

Batik, quilts, sculpture, and metal-work
converted the huge lobbies of the Gateway
Towers into galleries crammed with pieces
unsuited to outdoor viewing. Breathtaking
batik pieces by Murley Kay Kight and
Joanne B. Slates offered soft contrast to
Tina Galilei's marble sculpture ”Lady" and
Irene Pasinski’s plexiglas pieces. The clever
and useful steel and resin table, "Caribou
Under Glass” by Zsolt F. Vudy, captured an
attitude of sheer, careless joy. .

Ceramics and stoneware, woodwork and
leather-tooling attracted ‘browsers and
barterers to the Artists’ Market behind the

_Hilton Hotel... Corn-on-the-cob, fresh fruit

salads, pizza, and Crepes provided satisfy-
ing refreshment for the wanderers. The
heaviest crowds filled the market area and
in the heaviest crowds the pulsing energy
and spirit of the festival emerged. The at-
traction of the arts seems not nearly so
strong as the attraction of the relaxed, sum-
mer crowd. Sights such as amazed children
with painted faces gawking at a
lithographer in action and dancers on the
stage lent a unifying bond to the milling
strangers. Photographs and paintings can
delight the mind, but friendly artists and
neighbors touch the soul.

Magic Between the Evening Shows

THE PENNSYLVANIA BALLET CO. .
Main Stage-Three Rivers Arts Festival
Benjamin Harkarvy, Artistic Director
Saturday, lune 7, I980

By CANDICE KOMAR

There it was, that unique magical ex-
perience that happens fewer times than it
should. It is the event that every dancer
lives for, and is what the audience takes
with them after they leave the performance.
Anyone fortunate enough to be near" the
Main Stage at noon on Saturday, June 7,
was witness to such an event. The
choreography, costumes, music, andmood
of the audience blended with the warm
weather to evoke a wonderful hour of
ballet. The Pennsylvania Ballet has proved
their reputation for exciting performances.
The dancers are characterized by their
freshness, technical expertise, and the
special ability to project themselves into an

audience. They do not merely perform; it is

as if the dancers and the audience together
create their own special experience, which
is what dance should be.

The first work performed was Concerto
Grosso, choreographed by Charles Czarny,
with music by George Frederick Handel.
This was a modern piece which based itself
on the sport's ethic and action. Composed
of small variations representing such sports
as boxing, speed skating, gymnastics, fenc-
ing, and judo, each movement managed to
capure the personality and temperament of
each particular sport. The choreographic
movements were simplistic in design but
technically demanding. The steps were
done cleanly and with confidence. '

The second half of the program was.en—

titled Pas de Dix, with choreography after
the legendary Petipa, _and music by Alex-
ander Glazounov.‘ This classical piece is a
divertissement from the full-length
Hungarian ballet Raymonda. The women
wore the traditional tutus and the men silk
shirts and tights. The entire work glittered
with passes and allegro footwork that was

. well-executed by both the women and the

men. The dancers’ stamina and control was
amazing when one considers the exhausting
schedule they maintained while in Pitts-
burgh. They had just finished lecture

American Dance Ensemble at the festival

demonstrations at local high schools, a few
master classes, a performance the night
before in Heinz Hall, and another perfor-
mance the following .evening—-all in the
space of threedays. It was evident that
each dancer was working at his maximum
despite the humid weather and gusty winds.
The Pennsylvania Ballet, despite its youth,
has achieved national ‘prominence, and‘
with its personality, inventiveness, en-
thusiasm, and technical expertise, it will un-
doubtedly continue to achieve acclaim .as
one of the foremost in America.

THE AMERICAN DANCE EMSEMBLE
Main Stage—-Three Rivers Arts Festival
June 14, I980

By CANDICE KOMAR

The Point Park Dance Ensemble, mem-
bers of which are mostly college students,
presented an extremely diverse program at
the Arts Festival, and the performance was
impressive.

"Livin' in the City," a jazz piece by
George Benson, was the opening number..
Choreographer Douglas Bentz looked cool
and languid in the opening bars with his
back to the audience, one leg on a chair and

' a cigarette in his hand. The program then

switched to a modern ballet entitled The
Voga, which was originally part of their
program with Rod McKuen. The first
variation was unique in that thefemale
soloist and her two male partners danced
with their hands joined. This section still
managed to contain variation in tempo and
yet maintained its smooth lyrical quality.

ADE's attempt at comedy came about in
the piece called Olympic Symphony, by
Nicolas’Petrov, music by Shostakovich.
This was more pantomime than dance—the
costumes being actual sports attire and the
movements witty. The most satisfying seg-
ment was the gymnastic pair. Their perfor--
mance required a great deal of control and-
strength.

An authentic Russian folk dance fol-
lowed with elaborate costumes and fast-
paced steps.
Schleich then danced the variations from
Harlequin, originally choreographed by
Petipa. The two worked very nicely
together both technica ly and emotionally.

The program concluded with West Side
Story Suite. Bentz’s choreography was ex-
citing and flamboyant. His pas de deux
with Maria to "Somewhere" was dreamlike
and touching. The final scene left the entire
audience completely silent.

The Dance Emsemble showed an im-
pressive amount of artistic effort. and

_ dedication performed proudly and with af-

fection for their hometown.

Three Rivers Shakespeare Fest to Begin Soon:

By KIM WATTERSON

WILL IS IN PITTSBURGH! William
Shakespeare, that is, and the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival. The playwright
beckoned and his followers in the city
responded to his call with a menagerie of
entertainment that truly captures the
essence of the Elizabethan period. The
festival is in all facets a product of Pitts-
burgh—produced, directed and performed
by the city's finest. The efforts of the Pitts-
burgh's "theatrical family" will afford the
opportunity for many players to be
reunited on stage and, in other instances,
give actors the chance to work with other
talents they have admired.

The concept of the festival arose from the

vUniversity Theatre's sentiment that the

theater should be alive in the summer.’ The
festival promises to be an annual event with
this summer being its inaugural.
Shakespeare was chosen, according to
Christene Frezza, associate producer,
because he is the classic playwright—a
natural.

The University Theatre and the City
Theatre Company are the sponsors of the
festival with Attilio Favorini, chairman of
Pitt's theatre arts department, serving as ex-
ecutive producer. Favorini leads a staff of
approximately 75 Pittsburghers.

This summer's gala event will feature two
stage productions, The Taming of the Shrew

and Romeo and Juliet. Shrew, directed by
Gillette A. Elvgren, is a big bawdy comedy
highlighted by 26 pieces of music scored by
Frezza which includes seven songs perform-
ed on stage and ten taped pieces. This com-
edy promises to dispel the misconception
that Shakespeare is dull. The story rollicks

and is pure fun as life emerges from the play
itself.

Romeo and Juliet, directed by Stephen
Wyman, is quite a different type of story.
The play is the classic tale of tragic love and
portrays life in the same magnitude, but in
a different light. The saga is laden with con-

flict, so in the spirit of theatrical realism, V

Alex Colman, out of New York, has come
to teach the actors stage fighting for this
production. _

The actors and technicians have been liv-
ing and breathing Shakespeare throughout
the summer, with the rehearsals for Romeo
and Juliet taking place during the day and
those for the Taming of the Shrew in the
evening. The rehearsals, in and of
themselves, would provide entertainment,
should a straggler wander in. One would
find jugglers juggling, costume designers
pinning and fitting, choreographers danc-
ing, musicians practicing, and a designer
here and there creating some of the most in-
tricate and beautiful props and scenery.

The festival. offers something for
everyone and included much more than the
stage plays. The Dog and Pony show, an
old threatrical term, features eight enter-
tainers specializing in song and dance.
These entertainers provide some lively rem-
nants of the Elizabethan period in their per-
formance before and after the plays. The
Bard’s Buffet will be serving a family picnic
on the Cathedral lawn several days of the
festival. This will be provided by Universi-
ty catering and the menu includes along
with the meal, make-your-own-sundaes
"As You Like It.".

Jody Mccllntock and Joseph Pllato perform In Taming of the Shrew

Shakespeare was chosen because he is the classic playwright

The Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival is
a chance for one to see the master's plays
performed by Pittsburgh talent and is a
welcome addition to the cultural expansion
of the city. The Tamingof the Shrew will be
running June 27 through July 19 and Romeo

Part II: Marsy is Sailing Air Waves to Success

By JEFF LEHMAN g

Connellsville, Canonsburg, and
Charleroi: WDVE morning disc jockey
Marsy may be the only person I'll ever
meet who has had a bona fide job in each
of those western Pennsylvania‘ towns.

And since I've never met Charo, Fa-
bian, Syreeta, or Dion, she is the only
person I've ever met who goes by only
one name. J J

Seven floors above 7th Street, in
WDVE's studio in the Commerce '
Building, Marsy and I talked about her in-
famous limousine ride with Stanley
Clarke, the ketchup bottle that brought
her waitress career to an abrupt ‘end,
"Suntan U.,” and being "discovered."

SHOWCASE: Marsy, when did you
know you wanted to get into radio?

M: Yesterday! No, actually I've been in-
volved in radio for about seven years, the
past five here at WDVE.

SHOWCASE: You must have had some
crazy jobs before that.

M: I worked in a dishroom once: cleaning
dishes, wiping off tables, and throwing
stuff down the garbage disposal.
SHOWCASE: That's wild because Lily
Tomlin was on Johnny Carson last night
talking about her old jobs and it was
hilarious. She was a waitress at Howard
Johnson's—— .

M: Me too! 80 cents an hour and tips. I
waited on a table of 12 once and they left
me a dime tip!

SHOWCASE: She mentioned that they
had trouble finding waitresses because
nobody wanted to wear HoJo's waitress
uniforms. ~
M: The blue and white checked dresses. . .I
could never get one to fit me!’ And we had
to wear a hairnet. The only thingl would
not do when I worked at these places was
mop floors. Once, when Ixworked in the
dishroom, someone dropped a whole bot-
tle of ketchup on the floor and the
manager wanted me to go get a mop and
.mop it up. I said "Nope, I don't do
floors." We had a confrontation and that
was the end of that job.
SHOWCASE: You saw no future in that.
Where was your first job in radio?
M: My first job was with WLSW in Con.-
nellsville.
SHOWCASE: When you first watched
‘ "WKRP in Cincinnati," did it remind you
of your radio station in Connellsvillel
M: No, it reminded me of here!
SHOWCASE: How long were you there
at WLSW? . V V -
M: Three weeks? I think it was three
weeks. ‘ ' i r

.1.-..,

SHOWCASE: Threeweeks? Then you
landed this job?

M: No, while I was at WLSW I also had a
job in Canonsburg. The driving back and
forth was killing me, so after three weeks I
had to quit one. of them. Later, while I
was teaching school (A woman was on
maternity leave), I had bought a tape deck

‘and I went down to the Charleroi radio ‘

station to ask the program director his
‘opinion of the equipment. .He had just
happened to have the weekend shift open.
So I taught school during the week and I'd
do;adio on the weekend. A few months ~
later, Jimmy Roach called me and offered ..
me a job at WDVE. He had been listening
to the radio one night, playing with the ~
dials, and he -stopped on WESA and
listened for 45 minutes or so, ‘looked the
station up in the phone book, and called.
That's like sitting in the drugstore and get-
ting ”discovered."

SHOWCASE: Really! Going back a little,
where did you go to college?

M: University of Miami.

SHOWCASE: Suntan U., huh?
M: I made it through without even taking,
underwater basket weaving! No, really,
one semester I took calculus, biology,
‘- chemistry, and advanced English. I'm not
going to say how I did! The university
was making a major attempt to dispel the
country club image, and right in the mid-
dle of this great push, someone in some
office slipped and put an ad for the college
in Time and Newsweek. It had pictures of
people water-skiing and surfing and
boating and girls laying out in the sun in
their bikinis: "Come to the’ University of
Miami where both semesters are spring-
time!"
SHOWCASE: There are a lot of us who
began college in the late '60s. I guess
we're both part of the post-war baby
boom.
M: There's a new baby boom coming.
Our generation put off having families for
awhile, but now they're starting to have
kids. Haven't you noticed all the baby
stores cropping up around town? If you

Golem Gets the Rabbi Test

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN
THE GOLEM
Written by Leon Katz
Directed by John-Michael Tebelak

Somewhere ‘in the very old books of
Jewish mysticism, the Kabbalah, lies the
legend of a monster. He is the Golem, the
manufactured man.

In the Pittsburgh Playhouse's Craft
Avenue Theatre, through July 29, life is
breathed into the creature onstage. The au-
dience watches nervously as the horrifying
tale unfolds, the tension becoming unbear-
able at times.

The Golem is brought into the world by
Rabbi Liwa (Kevin Cotter), after a series of
attacks and murders wracks a small Jewish
village. He talks of raising the monster to
keep watch over the people, to chase away
the devils and the devilish. The rabbi is
warned not to do so by several men, but he
goes ahead with his plan. J

Rabbi Liwa's five disciples are enchanted
by his doings, and throughout the story
become more strongly anchored in their
faith. They help him along the way, pray-
ing and rejoicing in their superior’s courage
and -sacrifice. And the rabbi has far to go:
he must weather attacks by devils and
demons in a journey into what seems is his
own soul, becomes a learned man—-a sage,
as it were——and theh rounds up various sin-

\

ners to bring about the final moment.
After a brief ceremony, the Golem
(David Marchick) appears from a mound of

' earth. He is called Joseph,‘ and, though

created only from clay, he learns the ways
ofthe world in hours. Instructed to obey
his master, his brief encounters with
humans force him to deviate: he discovers
lust, anger, and hate. It is in the second act,
when the monster becomes caught between
doing good and evil, that the play gains its
most exciting moments.

Narrated throughout by James Lieb, who
is in center stage most of the time, this
Hebrew legend more than comes to life.
There are strong hints of humanitarian
messages weaved into the dialogue and
monologues. It is not unlike the tale of
Frankenstein's monster; in fact, Shelley's
novel may have been based on this
medieval legend.

The staging of the play was very nearly
flawless, with a great deal of help by the ex-
citing music of Michelle DiBucci, the
beautiful costumes by Erica Hollmann, and
the well-synchronized lighting by Alan
Forino.

Do not be turned away if you are
unknowledgable about ancient ' Jewish
mysticism; the play can be enjoyed by all.
And for those who like horror movies: it is
mandatory. '

SHOWCASE: It is often difficult to get up
in the morning. Morning DJs try to greet
their listeners with a'nice attitude. Are
there any other guidelines?

M: You try to give people the weather
report and the time and be as cheerfulas
you can.

SHOWCASE: Do you remember the first
group that you introduced in concert?
M: The very first one I did was Crosby,
Stills, and Nash. I was scared to death. I
got myself together enough to go out on
stage and read the little piece of paper.
When I got out there, they shot this pure
blue light at me. It was so blue and it felt
so warm that I calmed down immediate-

ly.

SHOWCASE: Who are your favorite
musicians?
M: The Stones, Jefferson Airplane, Talk-
ing Heads, Joe Sample, Stanley Clarke. I
had a great experience with Stanley '
Clarke. I did an interview with him for
my Sunday night jazz show when he was
here with the New Barbarians (Keith
Richards and Ron Wood from the Stones
werein the group). It was touch-and-go
whether I would be granted an interview.
Halfway through the performance, the’
guy from the record company came up to
my seat and said to me, "Here's your in- ~
structions: When you hear them play

‘Honky Tonk Woman,’ that's your cue
to go backstage and stand by the fourth .
limousine." My friend who was with me
was to go get his car and follow us out to
the airport. Each member of the group
had his own limousine. Everyone got in
and the doors were closed and locked.
We had a police escort through town to
the Fort ‘Pitt tunnel. I don't know how
fast we were going, but we got to the air-
port cargo area in 12 minutes! There was
a chartered jet waiting. It was like a scene
out of Casablanca! The gates were open-
ed and all these limos drove up to the
plane. The group was based in Lake
Geneva. It flew out of there each day for
the next concert and would return after
the concert.

Miami, you must have friends from New

smaller cities such as Pittsburgh?
M: Some of them won't even come visit
because of all the things they've drummed
up in their heads about Pittsburgh. I have
no patience for that anymore because it's

Working Toward Obscurity

FAME
Directed by Alan Parker
Screenplay by Christopher Gore

By THOM PALMER

Our film, I hope, will he a
microcosm of New York. It's the
glamor of the Great White Way of
Broadway and the squalor of 42nd
Street, the dream of instant success
and the constant reminder of failure,
the fine line between a Iuilliard
scholarship ’and dancing topless at
the Metropole...It's George M.
Cohan and the City Ballet. Rock and
Roll and Vivaldi. It is New
York...vulgar and beautiful. A
dozen races pitching in and having
their own crack at the American
Dream."

Alan Parker
In his pre-production letter
to the Crew, July 9, 1979.

The Pennsylvania Ballet

This film, I am sorry to say, has proved
itself to be nothing more than a thin-
skinned stab at trying to create a story per-
sonalizing the trauma and triumphs of eight
talented stereotypes as they cajole their
Winsome way through the High School of
the Performing Arts. Director, or misdirec-
tor Alan Parker (surprisingly of Midnight
Express fame) succeeds in his attempt not to
go beneath the surface of.these youngsters
and he races us back and forth between all
of them with a ”who cares” hecticness that
ends in an abrupt, saccharine, inconclusive
way, making it saddening to know that he
had a good idea, but the blade he was using
for carving out character and plot was
about as sharp as a rubber knife. It's
cinema with childlike derision———problems
with solutions that are really problems, a
thin sheet of plot spermy with sentiment,
and ribald song and dance trying ever so

hard to burst its seams of banality. It is '

Fame...vulgar and well, just vulgar. ~ A.
dozen races pitching in_and having their
own crack at adolescent success after bad
auditions for Dancin', A Chorus Line, and
All That Iazz. Sorry, Alan. You write a"
nice letter, though.

THE SHINING

Dlrected by Stanley Kubrick

Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Diane
Iohnson

By THOM PALMER

What we can't decide after seeing The
Shining is whether Jack Torrance (Jack
Nicholson) turns into a drooling, terrifying
madman because of demonic ghosts or the
mental taxation brought on by isola-
We can't tell whether Stanley
Kubrick is telling us tales of gothic
poltergeist, psychopathic degeneration,
heightened sensory perception, or reincar-
nation.

The Overlook Hotel, where Torrance,
his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), and his son
Danny (Danny Lloyd) are winter
caretakers, is haunted, right? Or are the
claustrophobic co_n_ditions creating
hallucinations for these people? No, that's
not right, either. Danny is seeing these
things before they even move to the hotel,
through his ’.‘shining,” an ability to see
things into the future and from the past.
Whatever the case, I'm sure it makes even
less sense to the Torrances than it does to
us.

Putting all the blather aside, what we can
say about The Shining is that it is a perfec-
tionist’s model of filmmaking in "its
representation of achieving that "closed-in"
feeling. Kubrick starts in with very expan-
sive aerial shots of Torrance’s car winding
up the mountain road, and slowly (a time
of two hours and twenty-six minutes) whit-
tles it down. to some tight viewing area that
begins to make us nervous. Even titled
scenes like ”The Interview" and "Closing
Day” begin to decrease in length until he's
finally just flashing on the screen "2 p.m.”
and ”4 p.m.” This, however, is disappoint-
ingly broken during a series of sequences

ht Way: ‘The Shining’

that switch to the vacationing cook
Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) and the
chronicling of his trip back to the
Overlook. What happens when he gets
there affects us likea match to the nerve
endings, but after the scene sinks in, we
begin to ask ourselves if Kubrick is wasting
our time.

Technically, Kubrick is indeed not
wasting his own. His spooky camera
follows Danny like a spectre as the boy

rides his Big Wheel around the echoing halls‘

of the empty hotel, and his wide-angle lens
narrows the lavish rooms into a closed-in
craziness. The film is at its best when
Kubrick's camera creates action within the
frame in his highly-stylized, hypnotic way.
Seeing‘ Nicholson makes one wonder
whether he's playing a character or some-
one like himself——someone he has played in
the past. He is an actor of the highest
caliber, through physical expression and
vocal inflection, and it is a thrill to watch
him. But, sometimes it seems as though he
is painted with too much Kubrickism, not
letting enough of his own thespian abandon
bloom. Duvall is mostly a teary-eyed
hysteric who takes about an hour's worth
of film to get used to, but turns in a very
nice job once she's settled into delerium.
And Danny Lloyd has a chilly, averted
stare that gives his character a finer edge.

Overall, the film is captivating, although
these times are somewhat infrequent. The
precision of it carries us through the full
two-and-a-half hours, but the confusion
(which multiplies throughout the entire
film, even to the final scene) seems to strike
the only sour chord. Poor Stanley Kubrick
even seems confused. And wherever you

see it, the entire audience will indeed moan

(probably a reflex action) at the ludicrous
clumsiness of a final shot in the closing
minutes that stands out like a sore thumb.
But just to see the genius Kubrick in action
makes The Shining worthwhile.

PA Ballet Simply Splendid

PENNSYLVANIA BALLET
Heinz Hall 1
June 6 8: 7, 1980

By SUSAN COLWELL

The Pennsylvania ‘ Ballet presented a
variety of ballet styles with their June 6th
program at Heinz Hall. The dances includ-
ed Pas de Dix, a classical ballet, Four Men
Waiting, which leans toward modern, and
Carmina Burana, a modern ballet.

The program began with Pas de Dix, a

divertissement from the ballet Raymonda,

originally choreographed by Petipa, with
music by Glazounov. The divertissement
consists of an opening movement, six varia-
tions, and a finale.

Several of the variations were very well
done. The first showed Diana Duffy to be
very quick and precise with her footwork.
Fourth was a strenuous dance done by
Carol Klocke and Laurie LeBlanc,' who
were very well matched. Fifth was a show
piece for William DeGregory, the principal
male dancer, and his leaps and spins were
quite impressive‘.

The ballet, although a challenging one,
was well suited to an excellent corps of
dancers.

The next piece was Four Men Waiting,

choreographed by the company's artistic.

director Benjamin Harkarvy. It was set to
Saint-S'aen’s Fantasie for Harp and Violin,
Opus 124. Soloists were Robert Chausow,
violin, and Jude Mollenhauer, harp, both of
whom played adequately, though not ex-
ceptionally well.

The ballet emphasized a contrast in styles
between the men and women dancers, and
this was apparent immediately as the men
were dressed in white blouses and brown
pants, and the women wore brightly-
colored calf—length dresses. The music,
slow and classical, separated the sexes fur-
ther. Male dancers were earthbound, spen-
ding a lot of time close to the stage, while
the women were more lofty, their dancing
more classical in line and style.

The entire piece was danced very well,
showing the choreography to be first-rate.

’ S Carmina Burana, choreographed by John

Butler, topped off the night. The
Mendelssohn Choir, directed. by Robert
Page, and sang the text of the thirteenth
century poems, which had been set to music
by Carl Orff. '

The choreography did not attempt to tell

, the story in the poetry, but instead to cap-

ture the mood of the music. And since the
music captured the moods of the text,

,which was sung in Latin, the effect was im-

pressive.

The ballet had no less than 25 songs,
although the first and last were identical.
There were many clothing changes as the
mood changed, but the outf_its,
choreography, and dancers always
reflected the music. Some of the songs were
even accompanied -by silhouette-like slides
of symbols that were to help set the mood,

but several mistakes made when switching"

the slides ruined the effect. ~

The wisdom of bringing along the Penn-
sylvania Orchestra became evident during
this piece. The ballet was demanding
enough on the dancers without them having
to worry about musicians’ errors. These
musicians were familiar with both the music
and the conductor, Maurice Kaplow. Un-
fortunately, the choir was not familiar with
Mr. Kaplow and was dreadfully off on
several occasions. Since the choir was split,
with half on each side of the orchestra pit,
not only could they lose the conductor, but
they could also lose each other, and this
also happened. Luckily, the musicians
never wavered, and the dance went on with
no mishaps.

The style was that of a modern ballet,
and once again, principal DeGregory per-
formed beautifully, this time joined by
other principals Edward Myers, Magali
Messac, and Michelle Lucci. All 16 of the
dancers danced enthusiastically and ex-
tremely well.

The versatility and overall excellence of
this company was evident throughout the
evening.

The program for June 7th included From
Gentle Circles, choreography by Harkarvy,
Allegro Brillante, by Balanchine, and a
repeat of Carmina Burana.

THE FABULOUS THUNDERBIRDS
Fat City
June 12-14, 1980

By BRYAN A.C. KELLY

The ”blue wave” arrived in Pittsburgh this
month in the form of the Fabulous Thun-
derbirds. Just back from Europe, the crew
from Texas are blues revivalists of sorts. In
the strictest sense, the Fabulous Thunder-
birds is perhaps the most rigorous blues-
rock bunch around, and if there is such a
thing, they could be called a new wave
blues.

New wave rock is characterized by short
songs that are blended such that no one
member dominates the sound. That was the
purpose of the new sound, to end 15-minute
solos by the '70s ‘superstars.’ Much of the
blues also depends on long piercing guitar
solos and the continued meaning of the
singer, at least until now. . A

What the Thunderbirds seem to be doing
is using the new wave formula on -the good
old American blues. It works. Their songs
are fast, concise, and not too loud. But,
above all, they were pure blues. ‘

The Thunderbirds are a quartet made up
of guitarist Jimmy Vaughn (who does not

show off), laid back singer Kim Wilson,-

who also plays the harmon-ica, and a tight
rhythm section with bassist Keith Ferguson
and drummer Mike Buck.

Though undisputedly historical music,
the blues have evolved and its following is
s_till young.

Cheap Trick:
Nothing  

  Butt. Fun

CHEAP TRIICK/OFF BROADWAY"
Stanley Theatre I
June 4, 1980

‘ By SAM MATTHEWS

The fans really made out_ on this one.
Originally scheduled at the Civic Arena,
the concert was moved to the acoustically-
preferred Stanley. The kids switched their
tickets and prepared for a night of Cheap
Trick. The band didn't let them down,
either. In a 90-minute set, 18 songswere
fired back to the capacity crowd.

Their performance concentrated primari-
ly on material from the last four LPs. The
first part of the set included rowdy versions
of "Clock Strikes 10," "California Man,"
and "Top of the World." Robin Zander's
voice began to crack as Cheap Trick swung
into the middle part of their show. (They've
been on tour for four months, so that may
explain Zander's condition). Neilson played
mellotron on "Voices,” and he and Peterson
both played 8-string basses_ on "Heaven
Tonight." Zander's voice recovered as
Cheap Trick ripped into ”Day Tripper" and
played a five-song string‘ of their . best
known to complete the evening. "Ain't
That a Shame," "I Want You to Want Me,”
and "Surrender" finally brought the au-
dience to their feet. ”Dream Police” follow-

" ed as the only encore.

The most novel. part of Cheap Trick is
-that, while seeing them, you don't have to
think. They don't have a political stance,
sociological perspectives, or association
with any non-nuclear group. All you have
to do is enjoy the music. '

Scuito, the Decade got back to the exciting ,
energetic rock ’n' roll concerts it is famous
for when The Jags played before a full
house earlier this month.

'. Throughout the Decade's national con-

certs, the new wave hot-shots (Ramones,
Police, Fabulous Poodles, Romantics) have
consistently out-classed the more tradi-
tional rock acts (Pat Benatar, Tantrum,
Scuito). The Jags were a welcome back to
the good ole days and a wholesome contrast
from most leather and spiked punks. Their
punchy 13-song set was chocked full of
punky aggression and rockin’ pop over-
tones, but from their appearance alone the
London fivesome could have easily been
mistaken for some fresh-faced midwestem
Americans. I _ .

The Jags came out hot from the begin-,
ning and steadily built upon their early
momentum. The highlights of the show
were reggaeish "Woman’s World,” the
"Evening Standards," the less

Elvis Costello-sound-alike "Back Of My
Hand" and the band's continual chants of
"Wake up Pittsburgh(!)” to a Decade

' _ crowd that was polite but sleepy.

But if The Jags couldn't get a Pittsburgh

‘ audience excited, maybe The Decade's up-

coming slate of shows will. Los Angeles
punks The Alley Cats are scheduled for
June 30, Robert Fripp and his League Of

GENESIS
Stanley Theatre
June 13, I980

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

Genesis is obviously not superstitious.
Performing before a packed crowd on Fri?
day the 13th, the five-man band left no"
doubts that they were alive and well and
living in excellence. ‘I

It is something that is hardly seen
nowadays, "but this group seems to defy the
recent trend of extremely popular bands to
split up ‘(take Yes and Emerson, Lake and

Palmer, for instance), despite vocalist and '

drummer Phil Collins’ diversion into the
jazz machinery of Brand X. ‘Genesis played
for two and one-half hours, and the music
was as closely held together (tight, as they’
say) as could be imagined. ‘ _

' Drumming up many of their great hits,
such as "Dance on a Volcano" ‘ and

"'Afterglow,", to name only a few, the band’ i 
I interspersed many of the songs off their ~-

latest Duke album. The tunes were

remarkably carried out, almost verbatim ‘

musically from the releases,

Several aspects of the concert were ab- '

solutely superb. One was the unison

achieved between the two full drum sets of ’

Phil Collins and Chester Thompson. The‘
difficult. rhythms exposed both percus-
sionists as masterful musicians. The se-
cond, but certainly not secondary, high-
light was the light show. Impeccably timed
and synchronized, artistically crafted color

schemes flashed to the music. It was by far .-
the most visually, pleasing show—complete .,

ecutive board of WPGH, consisting
of General manager Jeff Couch,
Chief Engineer Ken Pierrehumbert,
Program Director Renee Pike, and
Business Manager Ric Franzi decid-
ed to go ahead with the $1,200
engineering exhibit in 1978.

But the exhibit could not be used
and an application could not be fil-
ed by WPGH when WRCT decided

' to comply with the proposed FCC

ruling. The ruling, Docket 20735
adopted in June, 1978, is an overall
proposal under which various rules
changes were implemented for all
non-commercial educational FM
broadcast stations, centering on the
low-powered 10-watt FM stations
found on many college campuses.

Options Open To Pitt and CMU

The option presented to CMU by
Pitt was the subject of a May 11,
1979 letter from past General
Manager Dan Shalenko and Media

Advisor Larry Lunsford:

“WRCT currently operates on
channel 202, 88.3 MHZ. It would
be possible to locate anew facility
on channel 201, 88.1 ,MHz if

WRCT were to move to channel ‘

204, 88. 7 MHz. Stations must be at
least three channels apart to
minimize interference.”

FCC regulations require a
minimum of four channels between
stations to minimize the broadcast
interference of neighboring
transmissions. The letter also re-
quested that WRCT sign a waiver
of the rule that stations be
separated by four channels so
WPGH could move within three
channels of WRCT. ’

Edward Perry of Educational FM
Associates suggested another op-
tion which would benefit both radio
stations.

Perry suggested finding WRCT a

top of the Cathedral of Learning,
519 feet above ground.

“That would give them greater

‘coverage than they’re proposing to

get now at 100 watts, and would let
them retain the ease of operation
that you get with a ten watt
station,” Perry said.

When upgrading to 100 watts or
more, stations assume additional
responsibilities, such as regular in-
spections and ascertainment of
community needs.

“They could operate just as they
do now, except they’d reach an area
which is approximately twice as
great as they’re proposing to reach
with 100 watts,” Perry said.

However, the option is con-
tingent on WRCT’s acceptance.
Because of a technicality in the FCC
rules, the option of switching to the
commercial band at 10 watts is only
available to existing FM stations.
The option is not available to a new
station like the one proposed by
Pitt.

“You could get what you want
and Carnegie could get more than
they’re asking for.

“You guys have wanted a station
for years, and this is really the last
opportunity that you will have any
opportunity to have any right to
the matter,” Perry said.
