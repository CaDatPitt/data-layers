Crime an
aspect of
vandalism
on campus

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

‘(Editor’s note: This is the

. third part ofa three-part

series on vandalism at the
University of Pittsburgh. )

Besides costing money,
vandalism is also a crime.

“Any type of graffiti
or vandalism is a violation
of the criminal code,”
according to Assistant
Director of Pitt Public Safety
Gary Moses, “and obviously
we enforce the criminal
code.”

“We look at two sections
of the code — institutional
vandalism and criminal mis-
chief,” Moses said.

Institutional vandalism is
a misdemeanor charge cate-
gorized as any damage to
any property or buildings of

the institution — in this
case, the University of
Pittsburgh.

Criminal mischief is any
damage where there is
a monetary loss to any
property, not just the univer-
sity’s. It is .normally a
summary offense which
can result in up to 90 days
in jail and a $300 fine or
higher if the damage is over
$500.

Moses said campus police
receives reports of vandal-
ism from all over campus.

“We get basically a gamut
between the overall mischief
or vandalism throughout the
campus area,” Moses said.

In 1994, 224 cases of crim-
inal mischief and institu-
tional vandalism were
reported, which is down
three cases from 227 in
1993. In 1992 and 1991,

In an effort to answer to consumers,
insurance companies, large corporations
and all financial sources for hospital
health care services, the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center is planning to
cut its overall budget by 20 percent in the

According to a recent UPMC news let-
ter, UPMC has been the hi.ghest-cost
provider in the region and one of the high-

“Our goal is to become one of the lowest
cost health care providers in the city,” said
Jane Duffield, a UPMC spokesperson.

The medical center expects to terminate
a total of 800 jobs between now and July

1, which begins the next fiscal year.

“We estimate that we will eliminate400
[jobs] through layoffs and 400 through
attrition,” said Duffield.

UPMC actually began making cutbacks
in as early as July of 1994 when it began
laying off nursing staff and maintenance
employees at Western Psychiatric Institute

and Clinic.

Many UPMC employees are concerned
for their jobs but also the welfare of the

patients.

“How can [UPMC] maintain the quality—.
of health care when they are cutting back
on the people who deliver patient care?”

Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) broth-
ers submerged themselves in
community service efforts last
weekend —— they painted, they
danced and they picked up
garbage.

“We got involved basically
because we are a_philanthropical
organization,” ' said FIJI
President Chris Nestor. “We do

community service — it’s one of I

the things we believe in and
uphold.”

The fraternity also was
required to do a certain amount
of volunteer work for social pro-
bations, according to Nestor.

Sunday afternoon, about 15
brothers worked with other
Habitat for Humanity volunteers
to work on renovating a house in
Braddock, Pa.

“We painted the entire inside
of atwo-story house,” Nestor
said. “It took us about ﬁve or six
hours.”

Dawn Lehman, volunteer .

coordinator for Habitat for
Humanity, an organization that

helps build houses for the less
fortunate, said the organization
can only exist with the help of
groups and people like FIJI.

“I certainly appreciate their
willingness to come out and visit
these sites,” Lehman said.

Nestor said the fraternity
brothers would definitely do it
again if they have the chance.
“What was nice about it [was
that] it also brought us together
to achieve a common goal and in
the process we helped out peo-
ple,” he said. ;

Young scientists and
researchers were given tips on
how to succeed in science at
the Survival Skills and Ethics
for Emerging Scientists work-
shop last weekend.

The workshops, held once a

month each fall and spring
semester, focus on skills that
cannot be acquired in a lab,

such as writing, teaching and

managing a job.

This month’s workshop and
the last of the semester’s series
entitled Directing a Lab,
Keeping a Job and Beyond
offered advice on advancing
careers, overseeing a staff and
managing research funds.

Keynote speaker Kenneth
Olden, the first African
American to head any of‘ the
17 institutes of the National
Institute of Health and current

director of '-the National’

Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences and National
Toxicology, advised the audi-
ence on how to make it to the

. top in any field.

“Few people accidentally
achieve goals,” Olden said.
“You have to think big.”

Olden suggested creating a
“road map” to your goal. He
suggested frndinga role model
in someone who has already
achieved success, emulating
them and asking questions. '

“If you want to drive in the
fast lane,” Olden said, “you
have to know where you are
going.”

AIDS and 45 had died by the

Vandals

°Frompage1 _
162 and 170 cases were reported,
respectively. ,

According to campus police
CrimeWatch, there have been 39
cases of vandalism reported in
January and February of 1995. That’s

on pace to match the 1993 and 1994
numbers.

But Moses said he does not think
the increased number signifies any
trend. 8

“I think that with any crime of
this type, it can fluctuate. I don’t

Assistant Director of Pitt Police Gary Moses said gang graffiti is on the decrease at Pitt, but William pm Union

think that there is a movement
out there that says ‘I think we’re
going to go out there and damage
more property,”’ Moses said. “It fluc-

‘ tuates, and it fluctuates with the type

of people that are in the environ-
ment.” Of the 104 cases of institu-
tional vandalism and
criminal mischief
reported in the six-
month period of
October 1994 to
February 1995, 38
percent, or 39 cases,
were cleared — mean-
ing an arrest was
made. The majority of
the arrests were out-
, siders with no affilia-
tion to Pitt, Moses
said.
One of the biggest
aspects of graffiti
is expected to be
gang-related but
there is not as much as
people think on cam-
pus, according to
Moses.
“When I started about
two years ago, I
saw some [gang
graffiti] but "recently
there hasn’t been
any,” according "to

Graduate Manager

Michael Midden. ,

Moses agreed that gang graffiti has
been on the decrease around Pitt,
but he added that it's very hard to
tell what is and what isn’t gang-relat-
ed.

“Kids get up there and they do it or

'they copycat something else they

see,” Moses said.

A lot of times, people report that
they see gang—related graffiti in a
dorm or the student union.

“What’s the purpose of a gang

member going in and putting [graffi- 8

ti'in a university building]? They
want it seen. ,

They want it seen by everybody,
and no one is seeing it there
except the few students that are
going through that area,” Moses

said.

Moses said his guess was that most
of the writing he’s seen in stairwells
or inside buildings is done by copy-

cats or just someone drawing any ,

type of graffiti.

“We are particularly conce_,rn,.ed
because gang graffiti usually
indicates turf,” according to Robert
Hopkins, Pitt director. of
Housing Services. “On the one side
that a gang may use graffiti to mark
their turf, ‘we clean it to mark our
turf.” .

No one gang really has turf in
Oakland, so the gang graffiti at Pitt
is limited, according to Moses.

- lenging the status quo to set

oneself apart from the masses.

The key to being successful
in any field, he said, is to “be
perceived as a playmaker.”

The workshop also focused
on creating a productive lab
environment through mentor-
ing.

Awards to recognize excel-
lence in mentoring were given
to Susan McCarthy, assistant
professor of surgery and molec-
ular genetics and biochemistry,
and Ian Reynolds, associate

professor of pharmacology. The
two were chosen from nomina-
tions given by over 250 work-
shop participants throughout
the course of the series.

McCarthy said the most
important thing in mentoring is
to allow your staff the chance
to learn and to treat them with
respect.

“The golden rule that we all
learned probably before kinder-
garten is to do unto others as
you would have done unto
you,” she said.

Reynolds said he believes it

is important to provide a labo-
ratory atmosphere that is both
fun and critical.

“What you are doing is tak-
ing a seed, giving it fertilizer
and letting it grow,” Reynolds
said.

This is the first year this
award has been presented, but
Beth Fischer, project coordina-

tor, said she would like to see it ,.

become a tradition.

“Our hope is that this may
someday become like the
Teacher of the Year Award,”
Fischer said.

FUI brother Tom Curran said
Habitat for Humanity is a great
program, since it helps people
get a new start. He said most
people take it easy or sleep in on
Sunday mornings and after-
noons, and it’s not a big deal to
get up and go out and help peo-
ple.

Saturday morning, about 10
guys trekked out at 8 a.m. into
the cold rainy weather to pick up
trash along the Monongahela
River as part of Duquesne
University’s Spring Clean—Up.

“We picked up trash for over
two miles and cleaned up the

area,” Nestor said.

According to Larry

tor of Pitt’s Student Volunteer

tion with Duquesne’s project.

He said this project includes
clearing and cleaning up bike
and walking trails along the
Monongahela. “It’s deﬁnitely a
worthy cause.”

tions chair, said the group picked
up a lot of glass bottles, beer

union contract since Jan. 10.

“We are still a mile apart,”
said Borsos. “They still are
proposing a wage freeze,
elimination of the health and
welfare fund, elimination of
our pension fund and other
drastic cuts.” .

According to Borsos and
other ll99P workers, the cut-
backs have placed an impos-
sible workload on the
remaining staff and the
patients are not getting the
same quality health care.

UPMC denies that the bud-
get cuts are affecting patient
care.

“We have looked at the

cutbacks very carefully,
through a re—engineering
process,” said Duffield. “ It
is our full expectation to
maintain and improve patient
care through this re—engi-
neering.” S ’

While the cutbacks are

and nursing staff, ll99P

cutbacks began, Thomas
Detre —— the senior vice

ences -— and Jeffrey Romoff
— the senior vice chancellor
for health administration —
received salary increases.

Detre received a 2.7 per-
cent increase raising his
salary to $411,596 and
Romoff also received a 2.7
percent increase, bringing his
salary to $328,435.

Duffield said the cutbacks
have been across the board.

“The cutbacks have been
in administration, clinical
care and all services to
the organization,” said
Duffield. “Virtually every
area of the organization has
experienced or will experi-
ence cutbacks.”

According to the union, the
total annual wage compensa-
tion for about 38 employees
is nearly $30,000 less than
Detre and Romoff’s' com-
bined salaries.

In a recent newsletter, John
Paul, executive vice presi-

dent, said the budget cuts are .

a painful process, but UPMC
must take these steps to
remain a viable institution
and a major player in the
health care market.

  

Opinions
Leave Lothrop open

Lothrop cafeteria will close at the end of this year, appar-
ently permanently, according to the Student Government
Board. The block plan will remain as is, but the places where
students are allowed to used them will decline.

Tower C will remain open and the Lothrop cafeteria corpse
will be cannibalized in order to upgrade the Towers. In addi-
tion, nutritionists and nutritionist interns at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center and the School of Nursing will be
able to analyze the nutritional value of some of the food. In
the final bit of Food Services tyranny, all resident students
will be required to buy into the block plan. Again, students
are denied a choice and forced to buy into a plan they may
not necessarily want. Food Services is trying to cut its losses
by forcing this upon the students. ‘ ,

According to Dr. Leon Haley, the Lothrop Cafeteria will be
converted into an exercise center. So, the ovens will be
replaced by weight benches and nautilus equipment. Students
get enough exercise running to class or walking up the hill to
Lothrop. They’ll have to run much faster now if they want to
get a meal in before class.

While the Towers are more centrally located, that should

«not be used against the students in Lothrop.Hall. Many stu-

dents who live in Lothrop are health professions students,
whose classes are located primarily in areas immediately sur-
rounding Lothrop Hall. Last year students complained about
having to leave Lothrop for meals on the weekends. Now
they will be forced to use Lothrop as a. place for sleeping
only. ,

If the Towers’ location is what makes them. more desirable,
then the same logic could be applied to a lower—campus fit-
ness center. Shouldn’t the lower campus fitness center be
more centrally located for the use of more students? What
ought to go before the Lothrop Cafeteria is Eddie’s.

Trees Hall already exists for students who feel they need a
fitness center. If they refuse to use walking up the hill as a
warm-up, then there is always the shuttle system. Perhaps the
shuttle system ought to be expanded t_o__encou_rage increased

use o‘f"Trees Hall.
If the use of Trees declines dramatically, will it be closed in
favor of something on the lower campus? When the master

space" plans are looked at and re-evaluated, this ought to be a

concern for the planners. _

Are the students on this campus in need of more exercise
for physical fitness? If the university is interested in promot-
ing the health of their students, then they should leave the
Lothrop Cafeteria and the Tower C Cafeterias both open.
While missing an exercise session is not likely to prove over-
ly detrimental to health, skipping meals or relying on a con-
venience store for several meals a week will.

The students should be considered first in the planning, not
recouping the losses of the meal service.

School Choice is not empowerment

Clinton placed
their daughter

:    Chelsea in an
Columnlst exclusive pri-

  

Rick vate school in
- Wa s h i n g to n
Nowlm upon his inaugu-

ration, conservatives cried foul.
They said, “If the President can
put his child in a private school,
why can’t we dothe same?”

The thing ,is,’ they ‘can. Only
they want you and me to help
pay for it, and I don’_t..think
that’s right. i

In a column that appeared
last summer, I tried to expose
conservative hypocrisy intheir
stated opposition to “big gov-
ernment” except when their
agenda depends on it. They’re
still at it, this time under the
guise of a cockamamie idea
popularly known as “school—
choice.”

Such a program allows state
money to be used for private
elementary and secondary
school tuition, either as a tax
write-off or by simply allowing
parents and guardians a set
amount to be used at any
school, even private, parochial
or out-of-district public schools
(“vouchers”). What’s wrong
with that?.Plenty.

For openers, its supporters
haven’t figured out just how
much school-choice will cost or
how to pay for it. Since higher
taxes are obviously out of the
question, the money will have
to come from cuts in other pro-
grams, which they won’t name.
Some have said that it will
eventually save money in the
long run by lessening the
demand for public schools, as
some Catholic schools in the
area suggest by displaying large

‘ signs in front. I see no evidence

of that.

Many school-choice propo-
nents will tell you that the pub-
lic school system is stagnant
and “needs competition” in
order to improve. They argue
that, since private schools seem

to do a better job, why not
throw some state money their
way and take some of those stu-
dents who might be better

served by a private education?"

However, having had a mostly
private education myself, I can
tell you that such an analysis
doesn’t square with reality. _
Private schools institute‘-.,i_.~a

selection process as to whom _

they’ll accept; on the secondary
level, they even have entrance
exams. Therefore, the private
school student is already more
talented and disciplined than
his or her public school coun-
terpart. Now how is there true
competition? _ , p
More important is parental
involvement — or more suc-
cinctly, the lack thereof. Many
parents, especially in lower-
income households,,use the
public schools as a daytime
babysitting service and don’t
really care if their children are
learning or not. Or else, they
feel that “teaching is the
teacher’s job” and then com-
plain when their children fail or
don’t learn as much. As a
result, many teachers spend an

inordinate amount of time try- -

ing to keep the class quiet.

An extreme example from
about 15 years ago was the case
of Ceinwen King-Smith, a
blind teacher in the Pittsburgh
schools who consistently
received poor ratings because
of her inability to control her
class. However, she said that
when she taught in a private
school, she only had to threaten
to tell parents that the children
were acting up, and her stu-
dents straightened up right
away.

School-choice backers have
also insisted that their proposal
“will empower parents, espe-
cially in lower—income house-
holds, to make choices con-
cerning their children’s educa-
tion.” Double talk, pure and
simple. Gov. Ridge’s proposal
calls for $700 per year per ele-
mentary school child and
$1,000 for secondary school.
On the other hand, the cheapest
private school I know of costs

over $3,000 per year._Someone
tell me how that helps the poor,
who can’t afford to make up the
rest. .

Anyway, the real issue hereis,
not educational achievement
but social control.
Conservatives have jumped on
the school-choice bandwagon‘
largely because of their con-
tempt for teachers’ unions and
their “liberal agenda” which
they say has nothing to do with
education. Interestingly

enough, when those same,
unions call for dialogue with A

parents and the community,
silence reigns. That’s why the
National Education Association
opposes “school-choice” — it
ignores community issues
which they have to deal with in
the schools (such as violence). ‘
Furthermore, such proposals
were used to avoid integration ,
in major Southern cities in the
1950s and ‘60s, most notably
Birmingham, Ala., which at
one point tried to close its pub-
lic schools and pay private
schools to educate white chil-
dren. As most private schools
in Pennsylvania are white,
black parents have two fears:
1) private schools are by defini-
tion racist (true or not) and thus

’ their children can’t learn; and

2) when white children leave

public schools, they take"

resources with them. That’s
why the NAACP opposes
school-choice. Ironically, back
in 1992, California voters
rejected a school-choice pro-
posal that included public
schools as well. Know why? In
part, because wealthier parents
decided they didn’t want their
taxes raised so that “those”
children can attend “our”
schools. 0

I have no problem with par-
ents wanting the best for their
children. “School-choice,”
however, will prove to serve
only the privileged few -— and I
don’t think that’s what America
is all about.

n yester-
day’s The
Pitt
News, a
small blip
_ ran stating
' that shooting
' guard Sotiris
Aggelou was
contemplat-
ing transfer-

 

ring.

Now, most of the time
players decide to run to
another program, they are
crybabies, whiners or play-
ers who don’t like to work.

However, in this situation,
the opposite holds true.
Aggelou is not a baby, has
never been confused with a
whiner, and is the furthest
"thing from a player who
doesn't like to work.

But you can’t blame him
for thinking about leaving
town.

. He has gone from a starter
at the beginning of the sea-
son to a limited reserve
player by the Big East tour-
nament.

. ' What makes matters worse
is the situation that will arise
next year. Jerry McCullough
will be returning, along with
leftovers from this season —
Jason Maile, Garrick
Thomas and Andre Alridge.
In addition, newcomers A
Kevin Willard, Vonteego
Cummings and Kellii Taylor
will be added to the mix.
.--This seems to be the recipe
for disaster. It would be a
minor miracle to keep every-
one happy in this logjam of
guards.

The answer to the problem
is simply to reduce the num-
bers. One less guy means
more minutes to be shared
by the others.

With the emergence of
Alridge, Thomas and Maile
this season, and the inﬂux of
talent in the form of
Cummings and Taylor,
Aggelou appears to be the
odd man out.

It has gotten so ugly that
some people are already
talking about what will be
done with Aggelou’s schol-
arship when he goes.

. So apparently, he is being
written off already.

It’s a shame that a player
who has given his heart and
soul to the Pitt program is
being treated so badly.

But don’t count Aggelou’s
career as a complete bust ,
yet. I’m sure there are a
number of programs who
-could use a good long-range
shooter.

Majors makes
necessary
changes in
spring practice

By Keith Pompey
Special to The Pitt News

Pitt football coach Johnny
Majors is very optimistic
about his Panthers’ chances
in the 1995 season after wit-
nessing his team’s improve-
ment during spring drills.

“I think we made excellent
progress,” he said. “On
defense we have more
aggressiveness, more confi-
dence in what we are doing.”

Majors continued by say-
ing the offense has not been
as quite as cohesive as the
defense at this point.

But the good news for
Pitt’s offense is the return of
most of their skilled position
players. In total, 17 letter-
men and six starters return
from a offense that ranked
second in the Big East in
total offense.

{The Panthers’ most noted
standouts will be running
back Billy "West, wide
receiver Dietrich Jells and
fifth-year senior quarterback
John Ryan.

The men’s and women’s_

track team was at it again as
several team members hit their
best times of the outdoor sea-
son at the Duke relays in
North Carolina last weekend.

“I was really pleased with .

our performance,” head coach
Steve Lewis said. “We had a
great meet.”

Senior sprinter Dietrich Jells
hit his best time of the season
in the 200-meter dash with a
winning time of 21.10 sec-

Anthony Dorsett finished
third, posting his best time of

Junior Jay Jones didthe

Wes Alexander didn’t want
to be left out, so he hit his best
time of 52.61 seconds in the

First time

lacrosse
fails to
make
playoffs

By Jerry Klayman
StaffWriter
The Pitt men’s

lacrosse team finished
its 1995 regular season
schedule this past week-
end by winning two out
of its three contests.
However, two wins

» were not enough to pro-

pel the Panthers into the
playoffs. This is the
ﬁrst time in team histo-
ry the team failed to
make it into the post-
season.

The weekend started
out quickly for the
Panthers. Thursday
night’s game against
Carnegie Mellon at the
Cost Center was a
blowout in the. true

sense of the word.’

Freshman goaltender
John McGrath got the
nod and manned the net
efficiently, allowing just
two scores.

The Pitt offense also
dominated on its side of
the field. Scoring early
and often, the Panthers
put away the game
before the first half was
completed. Final score:
Panthers 11, Carnegie
Mellon 2.

“The Carnegie
Mellon game was a
good one for the team,”
said head coach Gary‘
Neft. “The game gave a
lot of our younger, less-
experienced players the
opportunity to see some

quality playing time. .

John McGrath played
well in net.”

Up next for the
Panthers was West
Virginia Wesleyan and
the team’s seventh
game ever on a grass
surface. For this game,
Division III transfer
Michael Stuckert would
get the start in goal.
Due to a ﬂat beginning,
the Panthers found
themselves down early.
By the halftime mark,
Pitt trailed 9-3.

Starting off the sec-
ond -half with a’ great
deal of emotion and
persistence, the
Panthers crawled back
into.the game. A ﬂurry
of four straight goals by
the Panthers was
capped off by junior
David Walters, as he

April 13 1995

The

Hun er

Artis s

To act is to starve  for a
while anyway. Whether you are
hungry for roles, or only making
enough money to live on
Hamburger Helper for a couple
of months, becoming an actor
devours lives. What happens
when you have to live on and off
the stage as a student in
Pittsburgh? I found four talented
individuals who were willing to
tell me. '

Joel Lee Kulp is straight with
me. “You can’t go into it half-

. assed. If you really want it, don't

dabble. If you feel it and you
really want it, then do it."

Kulp, a 19-year-old sopho-
more in the theater program at
Pitt, has a 12-hour daily routine
that doesn't leave a lot of time
for illusions.

He declared his major during
freshman year. “I realized it was
something I couldn't do without
going through life asking ‘What

‘ if?'” The Pitt program allowed

him_ to take elective/core class-
es in a variety of fields, which
isn't true for all programs and

 separates the Pitt program from

CMU. Pitt also provided him
with the opportunity to perform

 _e_ar1i_e_r than most schools would
 ﬁe"w"as'the best man for the

role. "Recently, he appeared as

-the -Dummy in Ghetto, which is

hisseventh show. “lt's treatin’
me good.”

l'.ve seen Kulp in a few stand-
out character roles, “Darius” in
Jeffrey for one, which. he
explains was “verydeal” to him
— “The character the issues."
How does he get cast in the
roles he's performed? Kulp
attends the general audition in
the beginning of the school
year, and sometimes the cast-
ing works in strange ways. “l’lI
do a serious monologue, and

get a part where I go on stage, f

fall over and everyone Iaughs."
He shrugs.

In addition to the actual physi-
cal classes, Kulp tells me the
major entails a lot of history.
“I’m sick of theater history.” He
has enjoyed his acting classes
with David White, however. “He
taught me a lot about acting,
and my acting has changed. He
taught me about keeping things
inside. My acting is more low
key.”

Kulp emphasizes that there
are many options in a career
with this major — set design,
directing, film — but he wants to
stay with theater. (He cites that
right now there’s .“no communi-
cation” between the film and
theater departments. Possibly
because the film department
here is made up entirely of aca-
demic theorists; there’s not a
real filmmaker in the bunch.)
Kulp’s shooting for an MFA. “lt’s
scary (this field), but grad
school is where I'll meet peo-
ple.''

Ilona Harris is taking the alter-
native route.

Harris is a graduating senior
who is taking a year off to move
to New York and audition for
roles. Taught and directed by
the teachers here, she's
explored other realms like cos-
tume design and doesn't plan to
attend the MFA program here
because she feels she has got-
ten everything she could out of
Pitt.

“Getting work is really shaky.
It’s a crazy_job. You have to
know as many people as you
can on a national level to get
anywhere. I’m moving up there
[NYC] and hoping for the best.”
She lights up another cigarette
outside the Green Room and
explains the down side of being
a theater .major in general: “So
many silly politics, rhetoric, net-
working. But when a show
comes together, it's like you're a
family — as much as we don't
like to admit it." This family facet
drew Harris into her major. “At
Pitt, there is a lot of pressure to
bein an organized group. This
is its own group. I feel like it's
‘really productive because we
spend all ofour time doing
something that we love."

iWhiIe‘ going to New York
Vfsoujnds like a package deal,
 te'l’l‘s.,’rfié"'that‘ a “BA in
.;:Theater = waitress” and that
jalong with audition possibilities,
‘she may be out of work for
months before she gets even a
r_,“spear-carrying" role. She sees
‘this as an “O.K. tradeoff,
Tbecause I'll at least be pursuing
what I want."

Harris describes the theater,

‘ program here as a trickle-down
system, with one class incorpo-
rating the other, and refers to
theater as a collaborative art.
She lights up while discussing
directing. “Directing encompass-
es all of that. Keitel (teacher) is
so knowledgeable. In directing
l’ve learned so much about act-
mg.”

After five solid minutes talking
about directing, I start to wonder
why she's acting. How do you
describe the feeling of perform-
ing? “There's really nothing that
compares to it, but if I had to,
it's like sex in a really good rela-
tionship. You spend all of that
time preparing, and getting to
know the person, and that's
what you do with a character.
The stage is where you and the
character really unite." Here
comes another cigarette.

“When you look out and see
people's eyes filling up with
tears, it feels like you accom-
plished something.”

Making a difference in peo-

‘ ple’s lives moved Michelle

Proctor — who retains a Law
JD. — to enter Pitt’s MFA pro-
gram.

"I've always viewed theater as
my ministry. I'd like to move and
shape the world through the-
ater. I'm not there just to be
seen.” Proctor sees the MFA
program as a time for “emotion-

al, spiritual and mental growth.”
Following a performance of
Flachel during her senior year,
in which she portrayed a young
African-American who refused
to bring children into a racist
world, audience members came
up to her months afterward

telling her how the show had-

made a difference in their lives.
“I saw the power of theater.”
Since she had always planned
to attend law school, she stayed
close to her craft by doing film
work on the side because “most
of the work can be done in one
day.” This ended up becoming
excellent preparation for the 14-
hour days she would encounter
with Pitt's three-year MFA pro-
gram.

Proctor was introduced to
Pitt’s program by her boyfriend,
fellow MFA student KenYatta
Rodgers, who introduced her to
Sarah Barker, head of the
Theater MFA program. “Her
vision of the program seemed to
be ideal for what I was looking
for. She wanted people who
want to make a difference in the
wond through theater.”

“We're not the road to
Broadway,” explains Barker.
“Wec;,re preparing actors to work
in __the_ater‘»<,vghich'iserves the
community. We look for people
who aren’t starstruck. We try to
put together a‘ companylito, com-
pliment and contrast each other.
Michelle brings a strong political
awareness to her work support-
ed by her strength and passion
to perform.”

Proctor relishes the fact that
the MFAs at Pitt aren’t given the
impression that they are in com-
petition with each other, which
happens in some other pro-
grams. “This program sees that
every person is on their own
journey. It's very conducive to a
learning environment.” /

All Pitt MFAs are required to
teach one semester during their
first year, during which they are
evaluated, and it is decided if
they will be rehired. This is one
of the reasons Proctor reminds
me she chose Pitt. “This
increases your marketability. If
you're not performing, you can
teach.” .

“Beginning teaching was
exciting, but very scary," stress-
es Michael Hartnett, another
member of the first-year class-.
‘‘It gives you a voice to express
what you think is important
about theater — where it's
been, and more importantly,
where you think it's going.
We're close enough to relate to
our students, and learned
enough to be really informative
and teach the basics of perfor-
mance."

Hartnett teaches Intro to
Performance, one of a cluster of
core requirements at Pitt, which
means most of his class is not
looking to pursue theater as a
future. “I look at it less as an
acting class, than as a class to

-Joel Kulp and llona Harris

teach the appreciation of acting
as a craft. If we can create a
better theater audience, then
that class has done its job."

Hartnett begins a typical day
of the intense program with
Movement class at 9 a.m.
“Some of the classes we take
magnify the classes we've
already had, but I've never had
a movement class as an under-
grad.” He emphasizes its impor-
tance. ‘‘If you're not getting the
physicality of,.the character [its
not beIievabIe]."

Voice begins at 10:30 a.m.
and, character development
aside, it teaches the MFA to
Ieam how to speak for two-and-
a-half hours. “Above and
beyond all else,_ it's our respon-
sibility to tell a story. You're
learning to speak from the
heart,’not just reading lines off
the page." Roughly, he has less
than an hour to eat — or be
interviewed — before he has to
attend Acting class from 1 p.m.
to 3 p.m., studying naturalistic
techniques. Later, he puts his
time in at the Prop Shop, which
is part of his assistantship. All
grad students must work in
some area — properties, box
office, etc. —— for fifteen hours a
week each semester. This pro-
vides them with a stipend for
tuition and/ or to live, while intro-
ducing them to another facet of
the theater. Along with late-night
rehearsals, it also takes a con-
siderable chunk out of his week.

Hartnett personifies diversifi-
cation. He took a year off to do
professional theater in
Philadelphia before transferring
to Pitt, where, aside from pursu-
ing the MFA, and in between
performances, he spends time
playwriting and working with the
Susquehanna Hat Co., a local
improv troupe. “[lmprov] is truly
interactive theater. It's theater
without a safety net. It's what I
love to do because it's theater
at its most visceral."

Hartnett finishes his lunch and
comments about how he some-
times uses this time for bizarre
meditation practices. When I

Clockwise frm top- Michelle Procor, Michael Hartnett,

write this down, he starts laugh-
ing, telling me he was just kid_;-
ding (sure, sure), and his reac-
tion reminds me that he's an
employee of the university now.
Aside from expressing the diffi-
culty of being both student and
teacher at the same time, this is
the closest he, or any of the
actors for that matter, comes to
any criticism.

The fab four that I talked to
have had varying degrees of
success at Pitt, from only one
mainstage role to lead charac-
ters, and even though each one
had very little criticism to -offer

’——- which could be a result of

their compromised position as
current members of the pro-.
gram — all four seemed_.as can-
did as possible with me. I was
really given the impression that
they wouldn't be in the program
if they weren't happy with it.
Even though neither woman
interviewed mentioned the lack
of women's roles in the produc-
tions at Pitt, both women
expressed the need for? more
exciting, audience-friendly,
diverse productions. Proctor in
particular is among the students
lobbying for The Colored
Museum to be put onnext year
here.

“The MFA program is a very
rigorous‘ intellectual, emotional,
psychological and physical chal-
Ienge," explains Sarah Barker in
an understatement of the year.
Taking all of the outside work
that the student (BA and MFA)
has to include in their schedule,
anyone considering entering the

‘theater program at this institu-

tion is really considering a
lifestyle.

Beyon
Tank Girl ,
Directed by Rachel Talalay

With Lori Petty, Ice-T and
Malcolm McDowell

Everyone l’ve talked to about it
has slagged Rachel Talalay’s
screen adaptation of the comic
book Tank Girl as one of the
worst movies to be released late-
ly, and I just don’t get it.
Whattsamatta? Don’t you like to
see sexy punk rock girls team up
with revolutionaries to throw a
knucklepunch to the nuts of fas-
cist corporate dick-heads? Don’t
you like to see lce-T made up
like a kangaroo, fighting against
Malcom McDowell in the same
film? You got a problem with
Tank Girl’? See me after class.

Let’s get a little background
going down here: The year is
2033. What we have is another
post-apocalyptic scenario, much
like the one in Road Warrior.
This time, however, the high-
stakes commodity that’s got.
everyone grabbing is not gaso-
line, but water. It turns out that
the world's supply of the liquid
lifeblood (not beer, baby, but
WATER) has been virtually
sucked dry by civilization. To
make matters worse, poor planet

. Earth’s been parched even fur-

ther by a drought-inducing colli-
sion with a distant comet.
There’s been no rain for 11
years. The quest for a monopoly
on water has established a
police state controlledby an evil
corporation called, simply, Water
and Power. Where the bad guys
in’ Fload Warrior were a bunch of
slightly homoerotic gas junkies,
the creeps in Tank Girl work for
a utility company. Goose-step-
ping goonsquads, at the com-
mand of Water and Power, run
around kicking down doors,

-shooting loved ones and kidnap-

ping 10-year-old girls. Tank Girl
herself (Lori Petty) is content to
persist under such conditions,
stealing water and getting freaky
with her boyfriend, ‘until the cops
come for her people one night.

If you want to know more
about the plot, then go pay the
same $6.25 for a ticket that I did.
You know as well as I do that it’s
not my job to throw the story. But
if you're thinking what I'm think-
ing, then the year 2033 doesn’t
sound too far away. If you’re
thinking what I’m thinking, then
the emergence of a police state
designed to enforce an economy
of scarcity created by faceless
multinationals doesn’t sound_ too

cartoonish to be real. If you con-

sider that the U.S. Congress is
currently deliberating over a
crime bill that will effectively dis-
pose of the Fourth Amendment
in the Bill of Rights (that's the
one that say the cops must have
a warrant to enter your home,
jerky) then the Water and Power
goonsquads ain't such a far out
fantasy, are they? '
But, jeezis, this is just a comic-
book movie, right? Tank Girl is
sheer entertainment, and, as
such, _it had me rocking in my
seat. I wasn’t rocking from sus-
pense, since it’s pretty obvious
formula at work here, but from
the humor, color and imagination
with which the formula is treated.
Dig the beautiful birdy finger that
Tank Girl throws, with adoles-
cent charm and insolence, in the
face of her oppressors. How
entertaining to see a caricature
of fascist corproids used to rep-
resent the bad guys, and-then
see those bad guys get what
they desen/e. What a gas it is to
see Tank Girl and her frumpy

sidekick Flyer (Naomi Watts)’

upset conventional standards of
femininity with bullets, brains and
burlesque. Whose wacked vision
created the Rippers, the half-
man/half-kangaroo enemies of
Water and Power? Their make-
up, wardrobe and mannerisms
suggest a group of b-boys, beat-
niks and latter-day Black
Panthers. The Rippers are the
very gangsters that mom, dad
and the media tell us are too
dangerous to play with and who
turn out to be the good guys
after all.

Acting? Come on, this is a
comic book, it’s supposed to go
over the top. Everyone here
does a good job, even if Lori
Petty’s cutie-pie adolescence
does get a bit shrill at times. All
of the Rippers completely rule.
Malcom McDowell plays a car-
toon version of his own bad-guy
typecast, and Naomi Watts, the
nerdy brain—child, beautiful
behind her glasses, had my

ratchet wound tight a full five"

minutes, at least.

Tank Girl lets other recent
attempts at screen comics such
as Cool World eat its dust, using
animated sequences as a transi-
tional deviceand to make the
story-line visually explode at
times. lt’s a funny, thoroughly
entertaining dream, a kind of
hokey Riot Grrl anthem targeted
for a young audience. It ain’t
serious, but it's a lot of fun. So
why all the empty seats?

Nitzer Ebb
Big Hit
Geffen

The latest installment from the
British duo Nitzer Ebb, Big Hit, is
another collection of ominous,
bittersweet and psychotically dri-

 
   

ven computerized tunes. lt’s just
what you would expect from this
band with a few, very few, sur-
prises thrown into the mix to
keep things fresh, including two
slow.“'ballads” (if you would
believe that?). lt’s also damn
good. .But_don’t expect to hear
them on the" radio or see them
on MTV anytime soon. They
i have yet to write a. song that will
signifythey’ve~ become a leader
in the alternative world and not
just Depeche Mode’s sweet-
hearts. They are getting closer,
however.
Both musically and lyrically,
Big Hit picks up right where

Nitzer Ebb’s -last album,-

Ebbhead (1991),,left off. Bon
Harris (hacker extraordinaire)
once again transforms the
sounds of factories, computers
and god knows whatlelse into a
loud, maniacal symphony.

Hey, minus Harris’ partner,
lead singer Douglas McCarthy,
this would sound l_ike an effort
from Trent Reznor (Nine lnch
Nails)‘: The music is that power-
ful. Now‘, th'at’s"not to say
McCarthy’s not holding up his
end’ of the bargain. His voice is
stronlg and"ma'niacal,' almost

possessed, as well. Here’s the - ’

catch: there“a're times when his

Surprisingly, it wasn’t listed as a
main attractionon the cover
sticker. “Hear Me Say” possess-
es a very desperate quality,
thanks to McCarthy’s lyrics. No
doubt this should give_ it some
mass appeal..H_arris breaks up
McCarthy’s ponderings with a
wicked sound that makes the
song.

“Kick It’’ was listed as a_ main
attraction, and it's next. In “Kick
It,’’ McCarthy is at his self-
loathing best. (“see a man run-
ning away/ from what there is no

escape from/ see a man hiding] 4'

his face from the undeniable
truthl see yourself in the mirror/
are you looking for mercy?") it'll
do well with fans. Self-loathing is
in this year. By the way,
McCarthy really.carries this one
with his lyrics. ' '

This is the same kid that got

who’s “live and uncut.” The kid
that “got burnt once but it was
only Gonorrhea.” Out of the Wu
Tang’s conquest of the record
industry, he was one of the first
(it was between him and
Method Man whose Tical went

Amidst his troubles (being

I’m telling you from the door; you

Most of the beats are pretty
much of Wu standards (offtimed,
eerie, gritty, dark, very raw).

the first single, the underground
classic “Brooklyn Zoo.”

“The Stomp” is kinda like a

the good sense of the word)
track that he tag teams with
Raekwon and Method Man to
wreck.

On the off-colored end of this
album, you have “Don’t U
Know” (one of my personal
favorites) where ODB lets you
know that he likes his women to
be nasty; a woman that “will do
anything at any given time.” The

7
end poem is the coup de grace
to this song:

‘‘I tried to run, but she yelled
out freeze/ Pulled down my
drawers, dropped to her knees/
ripped off my drawers as if she
had c/aws/ broke the rules that
defied sex /aws/ She’ responded
quick/ with a slick/ welcoming
kiss with an ice cream lick/
(moans) I begged, I_ begged/
easy on my balls they're as
fragile as eggs.”

If you’re down enough to own
the cd, you got the pleasure of
hearing “Dirty Dancin’,” with
him and Meth panning their
voices from the left and right

Inside, the bar glows red from
light reflecting off the peeling red
booths that line the wall. Fire
helmets have been hung on the
wall by Chief’s present owner
Benny Provencano as a tribute
to the original owner, who was

have been smeared on the yel-

Theater-Revenge of the Space
Pandas

Written by: David Mamet
Directed by: Pam McCready
Lighting design: Jason
Peroney

Set & Costume: IC Light &
Magic

A sheep, four pandas from
space, a couple kids and an
omnipotent ruler and his syco-
phant. That doesn't sound like
a gum-stealing big dog to me
but the director did say “its
David Mamet without the fuck-
yous?

Mamet wrote the play for
children but it's not just pink
chocolate and bubbles. It's a
wacky, zany comedy about
what happens to bad children
who don't listen to their mom-
mies and toy around with the
laws of nature. I was told that if
l like cartoons then I’m gonna
be loving this show. Big dog-
gies, we have stumbled onto a
live cartoon show.

You have to photocopy that
— opium does the trick.

But the play has been adulti-
tied according to cast member
Chick Leiby, who goes on to
say it's a process of illuminat-
ing the dark humor in the play.
Some more death, what the
hell. So, the dark cartoon com-
edy will be showing only this
weekend at the Pit.

Also, there are going to be
Directing One Act plays in the
Studio theater with a dunking
machine, a purple wagon and
peppered bacon. Hey, not so
quick motherfucker because
after the One Acts, there is an
Acting 4 showcase.

The showcase will be per-
formed by the Acting 4 class
clowns. They are performing
The Wool Gatherer. I've never
heard of use I can't comment

‘ on it. It would be lying, but then

again my whole life is my lie.
Ok, so The Wool Gatherer
what could it be about? It's the
tragic ——no, the comic — rela-
tionship two people create after
being attacked by hairy ass
necks. Enough. For the love of
god, who are you?!

(it's also on the Jerky Boys

a crazy off track that has ODB
taking us to the next level.

The beefs I have with this
album are relatively small. For
one, “Drunk Game (Sweet
Sugar Pie)” should have been
left off of this album. No one
should be subjected to his
singing. Recycling beats from
the Wu album is not cutting it
either (“Protect  drumtrack
appears on this album twice and
“Clan In Da Front” shows up
once). Although these joints are
phat, it's too much like trying to
ride that success to death. Why

     

Krlow

' didn't they put “ive It To Ya

IT AL

Raw” on this album? It would’ve
fit in nicely. The two CD bonus
cuts should be made available
on cassette as well. Depending
on when you listen to this album,
the excessive screaming can
wear thin on you fast. The child-
hood voicebox game is fast for-
ward material as well.

The album is tight; if you
thought about buying it, do so.
It's money well spent. Just keep
in mind that it's unorthodox. It's
definitely one of a kind.

If you go back two or three
years and remember the under-
ground hit “Six Million Ways To
Die" by Funkmaster Flex, you'll
remember this kid. The scratchy
voiced wonder bowgarded his
way out the Bronx to represent
with ill metaphors. If you go
deeper in the game, then you
remember the very limited
release “Can’tlWon’tlDon’t
Stop (9mm Goes Bang)." Not
many radio stations played it
because that’s how limited it
was (I own itl). What you missed
was Nine showing that his skills
on “Six  was no fluke. Now,
the year is 1995, and he has a
solo album on the racks, minus
the two M's that followed his
name. ‘

one of the two ballads men-
tioned earlier. After one listen,
you’ve had enough.

“Floodwater” is short (3:36)
and very sweet. it gets to the
point right away and then
leaves you wanting more.
Unfortunately, its a dwarf com-
pared to most of the other
songs on Big Hit, where the
average length hovers around
five-and-la-half minutes. They
could have done some editing.

Side B: “Border Talk” isn’t
hard; it’s slick, even a bit
humorous. McCarthy talks
through the verses and sings
(probably with a severely
pissed-off look on his face) the
choruses. The combo of music
and lyrics creates a definite
atmosphere, sort of like a spy
flick. l’ll bet that’s what they
were aiming for. 1 .

“ln Decline” is listed as a
winner, like “Kick It’’ and
“FIoodwater.” But unlike the
other two, it’s only mediocre.
McCarthy actually sings the
word “fuck” in this one. You
either scream fuck, or you
don’t use it; you can’t sing it
and sound serious. The music
is, well, it’s there.

The next two songs, “Living
Out Of A Bag” and “Boy," are
lumped together because they

will be lumped together by «.

many an Ebbhead as they fast
forward past both. Both are
moderately slow and boring.
Both are too long. Both will be
remembered, unlovingly, by

' fans for albums to come. _

“Our Own World” is the suit-
able conclusion to Big Hit. it’s
actually kinda_ happy and
proud. "That makes itdifferent
from the rest, That, and its
sound, which is remotely coun-
try westemish. Take note, they
used a real guitar for this one.
The lyrics also help to promote
this feel. (A sample: we'll never
be broken/ not like the morn-
ing/ when the sky/ through the
night comes yawning).

All in all, Big Hit is a good
effort. it’s at least two songs
better than Showtime (1990)
and equal with, if not ever so
slightly better than, Ebbhead.
The band tried a few new
things with mixed results:
“Border Talk” is compelling, the
“ballads” are horrific. The
biggest difference between this
record and past records, how-
ever, is that McCarthy is not
bubbling over with anger; he's
depressed. But it works.

Moby
Everything is Wrong
Elektra

Moby, the evangelical
Christian raver, has done it
again. But this time Everything

1 Is Wrong, but the music is oh

so right! Raging, repetitious
female vocals, reggae sam-
ples, house piano, even trancy
stuff. This album is the answer
to all of your happy house
prayers.

What I love most about Moby
is his vegan bitterness. He's
anti-drugs, anti-meat, anti-pol-
lution, yet his music is so
pleasantly corrupt. Moby is
positivity without the tedium.

On the women’s side, Staci
Suggs, who recently won the
female Blue-Gold Award at
the senior banquet for personi-
fying the true meaning of a
scholar-athlete, hit her best
time of the season in the 100-
meter hurdles with a second-
place finish of 13.82 seconds.
Also, junior Tonya Mullins
finished fourth (14.48). 4

First-year hurdler Joetta
Purter also got into the act by
hitting her best time of the
outdoor season. She finished
second in the 400-meter hur-
dles (59.95) and Angie Martin
finished right behind her in
third (1:OO.24).

   

The 4 x 400 meter relay
team of Angie Martin, Joetta
Purter, Ayne Allen and Lakeya
Smith didn’t waste any steps
when they beat their best time
of the season with a winning
time of 3:40.53.

Although she finished in
tenth place, distance runner
Ayne Allen hit her season’s
best in the 400—meter dash
(56.29).

The Panthers will ﬁnally get
to sleep-in this weekend as
they host the Panther Relays at
Pitt Stadium.

“Our goal this weekend is to
try and get some national
qualifier performances and try
and to have some fun,” Lewis
said.

found the back of the net. The
Panthers were now only down
by two goals, 9-7.

The two-goal deficit was as
close as the Panthers came.
The final horn sounded and
the scoreboard read: West
Virginia Wesleyan _l4, Pitt 10.
Along with the game, the
Panthers also lost their playoff
dreams for the 1995 season.

“The West Virginia
Wesleyan game was very dis-
appointing,” said Walters, a
junior. “We just could not get
anything going in the ﬁrst half
at. all. In the second half, we
could have won the game. I do
not think that they were better
than we were, and I think that
if we would have played bet-
ter in the first half, we would
have come away with the vic-
tory.”

“At first, we didn’t play to
our capabilities at all,” said
sophomore Peter O’Hara. “By

the time we regrouped, it was

-too little too late. We could

not fight back fast enough.”

Sunday’s game against
Slippery Rock University
started out just like the West
Virginia Wesleyan game. The
Panthers were down by three
goals quickly. Fighting back,
the Panthers tied thegame at
halftime, 4-4. ,

Once again, the Panthers
came up big at the beginning
of the second half. Scoring the
first two goals of the half and
playing well on the defensive
end of the field, the Panthers
took control and never looked
back. Final score: Pitt 10,
Slippery Rock 7.

“It was great to end the sea-
son on_ a positive note,” said
O’Hara. We showed a lot of
resiliency in the first half. We
fought back. Saturday, we got
down early and never could
come back. We showed what
we were made of. The second

half went well for us. Our
defense tightened up and the
offense got into a groove.”

This year’s undermanned
team finished its season with a
record of 11-5. All things con-
sidered, the team had a suc-
cessful year. Many new play-
ers got a lot of. game experi-
ence that will be invaluable to
them next year.

“We have many players
returning next year,” said
Walters. “Our team rebuilded
this year. We arelosing very

few players to graduation. We'

are going to miss Matt Shea;
we have all learned from Matt
in the past few years.”

“I am really proud of this
team,” said Neft. “We were
undermanned the whole sea-
son long. We showed a lot of
heart. Most of this team will
be playing again next season.
With a good freshman recruit-
ing class, we will have a
strong team next season.” ’

East” is also closing in on
Pitt’s all-time career recep-
tion record. He only needs 22
more catches. <

“I expect him to give us
speed, experience and leader-
ship,” Majors said. “I think
he has grown up consider-
ably. I’ think he has has
matured between consider-
ably and drastically.”

-After beginning the season
as Sean Fitzgerald’s backup,
John Ryan developed into the
most efficient passer in the
Big East conference. The 6-
3, 210-pound signal-caller
finished the year with a

159.7 passing efficiency.

The Panthers are hoping
Ryan will continue where he
left off last year.

But while the skills posi-
tions seem to be overloaded
with talent on offense, the
offensive line has undergone
reconstruction with the
departure of Al1—American
tackle Reuben Brown and
four—year starting center
Lawson Mollica.

Due to Brown’s and
Mollica’s departures, two
former defensive linemen
will move to offensive line.

Senior Matt Hosilyk will
move to guard, while redshirt

junior Tim Robbins will
switch to tackle.

Redshirt sophomore
Reggie Thomas, who was
Pitt’s starting left guard last
year, will move to center in
1995. Thomas is expected to
be the cornerstone of the
offensive line.

The only noteworthy
switch on defense is David
Sumner’s move from free
safety to outside linebacker.

“This is a very positive
transition,” Majors said of
Sumner. “That is a better
position for him than safety
man. I don’t look to move
him back unless we are hav-

ing an emergency. He has
had a good spring.”

With Sumner at outside
linebacker, the Panthers are
looking to improve their
aggressive interior line and
linebacker corps. Five
starters and nine lettermen
return along Pitt’s front
eight, giving the Panthers a
solid nucleus.

Majors went on to say the
Panthers are a quicker team
overall than last fall.

“We are somewhat stronger
and a little faster,” he said.
“We have lost a considerable
amount of body fat in our
off-season.

Column-

°From page 6 ’

And it’s also not for certain
that he will be leaving.

It would be nice to see him
stick around and make a con-
tribution next year.

But don’t count on it, he
seems too be to proud to log
the majority of his minutes
on the pine.

So you may see Aggelou
again in the near future. But ,
the next time he hits a big
shot at the Field House, Pitt
may be on the short end of
the stick.
