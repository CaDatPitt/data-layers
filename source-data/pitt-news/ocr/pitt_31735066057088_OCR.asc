Rape victims rarely

After being raped by a Pitt student she
had met at a fraternity party last fall,
Jenny‘ was one of very few Pitt students
who considered pressing charges.

Minutes after her rapist had left, jenny
had to relive the traumatic experience as
she told local police officers what had
occurred on her bedroom ﬂoor.

Jenny had to suffer another painful
experience as doctors from a local hospi-
tal collected evidence. from inside and
outside her body. S

ers say, is because they blame themselves
for the actions of their assailant.

“The number-one response of rape vic-
tims is ‘I’m either to blame or somehow
held responsible for what happened,”’
Weiner said. .

Donham said he remembers one stu-
dent who took responsibility to the
extreme.

He talked with the student last spring
about bringing charges against her
boyfriend who repeatedly physically and
sexually abused her. ~

“She thought it was her Christian duty
to take this guy on and help him turn his
life around,” Donham said.

they weren’t really raped when they start

Revoke of Hoke's tenure cause of student rally  

 
 

By Victor Wallace
Staff Writer

The front of the Cathedral of
Learning was crowded yester-
day with students waving
signs and screaming their
protest of tenure denial to a
female Pitt law professor.

The debate over tenure
selection procedures was
sparked when Provost Donald
Henderson last week reaf-
firmed his decision to over-
turn a Law School faculty vote
to give Professor S. Candice
Hoke tenure.

According to the Student
Bar Association (SBA), which
sponsored yesterdays rally,
this is the first time a provost
has overturned a faculty vote
to grant tenure.

SBA members said they
believe that Hoke, who is fil-
ing discrimination charges
against the university, was
denied tenure because of her
outspoken criticism of the
administration.

SGB responds to if
students ’ demands
with resolutions

By Beth Kovaly
Asst. News Editor

Student Government Board members took an official
stand on two debated issues after students and organi-
zations pressed for their support.

Pitt’s Black Action Society asked SGB to recognize
and promote possible construction of a Black Cultural
Center on campus. 9

SGB supported the idea for a center and encouraged
Pitt administration to move toward its establishment.

Reasons included:
°“Alarmingly” low graduation rates for minority stu-
dents.

-Deficient African-American retention rates.

-Support and services for African-American students,
and the general student body, are fragmented through-
out Pitt.

-“[Pitt] must take steps to bridge the cultural, racial and
ethnic gaps which exist on this campus.”

SGB President Jacob Brody said that members of the
Board debated with student organization leaders at last
Tuesday’s President Council meeting on the pros and

speak out against
Black Cultural Center

ByBethKovaly

Asa Newsl-Jditor.

Though Student Government
Board members support the estab-
lishment of a Black Cultural Center,
Pitt College Republicans does not.

After SGB voted its support for a
campus center, CR President Kevin
Docherty said that a majority of the
group does not understand the need
for the center.

“Why single out a single group?’
he said. “Why not have a cultural
center for all students, for African-
American students as well as the
general student body?’

“I’m still waiting to hear a good
reason why we need a Black

Cultural Center and not a cultural .

Docherty said that the Black

job, why create another bureaucra-
cy?

“Is this really going to help?’

Docherty said he and other
Republicans had wanted to attend
last night’s SGB meeting to discuss
the resolution before it was passed,
but the College Republican’s annual
elediom were held at the same time.

A separate center, according to
Docherty, “stresses the differences
and not the similarities of the stu-
dents.” .

“The university is supposed to
prepare us for life, not coddle us.”

He said that his group was also
concerned with where the money
for the center would come from.

“Wouldn’t the money be better

spent to promote minority scholar-

ships?” ‘

“Any minority student feels left
out,” he said. “But by giving them
their own cultural center — are they
going to use it, and is it going. to
solve any problems?’

THE PIT!‘ NEWS,,'I'm,,ﬂ 20,1993 

By Carol Whaley
For The Pitt News

“It’s a beautiful day in the
neighborhood,” or at least it
will be on May 1 for graduat-
ing Pitt students.

Mr. Fred McFeely Rogers
will visit PitI’s neighborhood to
deliver the commencement
address being held at the Civic
Arena at 2 p.m.

During commencement,
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
will present Rogers with an
honorary Doctorate of Public
Service. This is the first honor
Pitt has bestowed on Rogers,
who is a Pittsburgh native.

“I think it's very exciting,”
said Hedda Sharapan, an asso-
ciate producer with his Public
Television Broadcasting chil-
dren’s show. “It’s truly an
honor. Fred Rogers’ back-
ground in child development
has strong ties to Pitt.”

The university is also excited
about Rogers’ appearance at
commencement.

“Fred Rogers is a Pittsburgh
legend and hero,” O’Connor
said. “For the past two and a
half decades he has been a
gentle yet profound source of
inspiration for millions of chil-
dren. In the truest sense of the
word, he is a teacher. And we
at the University of Pittsburgh
are tremendously honored that
he will grace us with his pres-
ence and his words at our
1993 commencement.”

Rogers is certainly no
stranger to receiving awards.

Mr. Rogers is coming
to Pitt's neighborhood

Among his many honors are
two Emmys, a George
Peabody Award and honorary
degrees from 28 colleges and
universities. This spring
Rogers was honored by the
Museum of Broadcasting.

Rogers is also no stranger to
the University of Pittsburgh.
He consulted with the late Dr.
Margarat McFarland, a child
development expert at Pitt, on
issues affecting children.
Rogers and his staff continue
to work closely with Pitt facul-
ty members.

“It’s not just physically that
we’re in your neighborhood,”
Sharapan said.

The School of Library and
Information Science houses

the Neighborhood archives, .

and the University of
Pittsburgh Press will publish a
retrospective of Rogers’ work
in 1994.

‘Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood” first aired in
February 1968. Along with cre-
ating 15 new episodes of the
show each year, he spends
much of his off-air time help-
ing children.

His nonprofit production
company, Family
Communications Inc., uses its
money from the sale of
Neighborhood merchandise to
further educational efforts.
Rogers, an ordained minister,
was also involved in a project
that produced videos for chil-
dren in domestic violence
shelters and children of men-

tally ill parents.

Action Union

helps student

organizations to he beam’

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

A group attempting to unify student organi-
zations so they can have a louder voice has
hit campus.

“The students of this group aren’t going to
let the administration stay in the direction it
is headed,” Student Action Union member
Olivia Kissel said at last night's meeting.

The Action Union has a focus to help give a
voice to the students, which it said has been
silenced by the administration and Student
Government Board.

“Every organization we have spoken with is
frustrated because the administration won’t
talk with them, and what is SGB doing about
it?” Kissel asked. ’

Members of the Action Union said they H

think SGB- needs to speak loudly so the
administration will have no choice but to

respond to student concerns.

“This is a way for all groups to communi-
cate and come together for a powerful
voice,” member Dean Gerber said.

The Action Union wants to get their mem-
bers to run for SGB in hopes of getting a
voice.

“SGB is real conservative and we want to

change that,” Kissel said. “We want to change '

the student government and the way the
administration functions.”

The Action Union now has three people
interested in taking SGB positions.

“The problem is SGB is talking for us, but
they are not talking to us,” said John
Staryszak, member of the Action Union and
possible candidate for SGB.

Kissel is also planning to run

for” SGB and said she is concerned with
the fact that only one woman is on the
board.

Continued from page 1
police said campus police go
through a very progressive sen-
sitivity training program. It is
important to sit while talking
with a rape victim, talk in a non-
accusatory way and, most
importantly, reassure the victim
that it wasn’t her fault, Grier
said. ‘

But Weiner said that the few
police-questioning procedures
that she witnessed during her
experience as a rape crisis coun-
selor, seemed to place the
responsibility for the crime on

the victim.

“The oﬁcer would say, ‘What
did you do when he went to
lock the door?’ Implying that the
victim should have ﬂed when
she had the chance,” Weiner
said.

Under Pennsylvania state law,
rape‘ is defined as sexual inter-
course by the use of forcible
compulsion, the threat of
forcible compulsion or inter-
course with someone who is
unconscious, mentally deranged
or unable to consent.

The law defines rape when a
stranger jumps out of the bushes
or when the victim is mentally
retarded but not when a rapist
uses “coercion or manipulation.”

“There is no law,” Weiner
said, “that deals with emotional-
ly badgering like, ‘Come on.
Come on. Please. I’ll be quick.”’

The experiences of a date
rape victim sometimes get worse
once she pursues a criminal
case.

 

“Traditionally, the justice sys-
tem has been a nightmare for a
victim to come forward, espe-
cially an acquaintance rape,”
Grier said.

But he said he believes the
law has slowly evolved, espe-
cially in the last five or six years,
making it easier for a victim to
prove that she was raped even if
she wasn’t brutally forced in the
traditional sense. 0

Until the last decade,
Pennsylvania law required that
the offense be reported within’

_ three months. A victim’s past

could also be used to discredit
her story. ‘

According to campus police,
no Pitt student who ﬁled a rape
report over the past five years
has ever decided to pursue
criminal charges.

Furthermore, no student over

,the past four years has taken a

rape case through Pitt’s judicial
procedure. ‘

A  Administrators disagree as to

why no such cases go through
the closed judicial system. ’

For Jenny, the system wasn’t
closed enough.

When charges are brought

against a student, that student:

has every right under due
process to know who his or her
accuser is, said Susan Rubisch-
Gisler, University Judicial
System coordinator.

For that reason, Jenny decided
to drop the charges, fearing
what her assailant might do to
her when he found out he may
have to face sanctions or a sus-
pension from the university.

Donham said the nature of the
judicial system is partly to blame
for the dearth of reporting
acquaintance sexual assaults.

The irony in the legal system,
Donham said, is that the truth
can often ruin the prosecutor’s
case. .

“Most women are very honest
about this thing,” he said. “They

I

   

APARTMENTS AVAILE

set themselves up for an inquiry
that weakens their case.”

It’s not the legal system, Gisler
disputes, but rather a broader
social problem that explains
why no student has filed sexual
assault charges during her four
years as Judicial Affairs coordi-
nator.

“The reasons for them filing,
in my perception, doesn’t have
anything to do with this system
or it being intimidating,” Gisler
said. “The reason they decline to

file has to do with the acquain-

tance situation.” .
Gisler said she has heard a
dozen students say, “I don’t
want to file, but if it happens
again I'll think about it.- I just
want to get on with my life.”
None of those students ever
came back, she said. 0 ,
Frustrated with the students
who continue to get away with
rape, Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs ’William” Harmon said he
hopes the university can take
action even when the victim
isn’t willing to do it on her own.

“The question thus becomes - ,

‘What is the responsibility of the
university?” Harmon said.
“»We’ve gone around and around
on this  whether or not we can
take what may be considered
administrative action.”

Pitt’s lawyers have yet to
come up with a solution. ‘

When the public and universi-
ty judicial system failed her,
Jenny took action on her own.

She moved: to another apart-
ment immediately after the
autumn night she still has night-
mares about. She receives

The End

Yesterday, the standoff between the FBI and the Branch Davidians in
Waco, Tex., a conﬂict that lasted four days longer than the Gulf War, ﬁnally
and tragically came to an end.

After 51 days of broken promises of a_ peaceful resolution by cult leader.
David Koresh, the FBI apparently had run out of patience. According to FBI
agent Bob Ricks, a little over six hours after submitting the barricaded cult to
nonﬂarnmable tear gas, Koresh ordered members of his cult to set the com-
pound on ﬁre, thus sealing the fate of the 80 people inside, including about
two dozen children. At press time, nine cult members were counted as sur-
vivors. .

Ricks said that Koreslfs last act was to lie to the Cult members about the
safety of the children inside. Survivors of the blaze told investigators that
Koresh indicated that the children were secure in a bunker before the blaze
began. They were not.

From the beginning, the standoff became a media circus as lawyers and
television producers seemed to have more privilege and inﬂuence than fed-
eral negotiators. Soon the abundant jokes on the late-night talk show circuit
served to diminish the fact that this man’s cult killed four federal oﬂicers.

Considering the severity of this man’s actions and the way he continually

mocked the authorities whose job it was to bring him to justice, the FBI .

showed considerable restraint in not moving to end the conﬂict sooner.

It’s hard to affix blame in this situation. Sure, if the federal agents acted v

sooner and apprehended Koresh when he was on one of his many excur-
sions outside the compound, all of this could have been avoided But it is
also hard to blame the feds when they are expected to act rationally with a

The bottom line is that more than 80 people have died on national televi-

sion and millions of people have been entertained That is a sad commer_1— .

tary on the callousness of modern American society. When those producers
come out with their TV movie, we hope people will resist the temptation to
watch it. Only then will the raging fire of the exploitation of human suffering
bedousedinthiscountry. And perhaps the media machine that feeds the
David Koreshes of the world be shut oﬂf.

C
What's going on here?

Today, Pitt law students marched outside the Cathedral — a rare

sight on this campus. The reason they marched is even rarer.
«‘ Even though in January 1992 the law schoo1’s faculty voted in
favor of granting Professor 8. Candice Hoke tenure, Provost Donald
Henderson overruled them in May and then reaffirmed himself last
week after Hoke appealed.

Staughton Lynd, a lawyer from Youngstown, Ohio, has refused to
teach at Pitt in the fall due to Henderson’s decision and said that he
believed it was the first time that the law faculty has voted for
tenure and the applicant has not received it.

Whether or not this decision is groundbreaking, it is unusual

enough that it deserves some explanation. Henderson has made
the decision: he should explain it to those concerned with the deci-
sion, especially Hoke herself.
C Questions have been raised about this situation. Hoke has report-
edly filed a discrimination claim against Pitt with the Equal
Opportunity Employment Commission, a claim that could be bol-
stered by the fact that only four of 21 tenured faculty in the Law
School are female. -

President of the Student Bar Association Chris Biancheria said,
“lHokel was outspoken on issues.of gender and racial-ethic politics
and has also been a critic of the centralized bureaucracy of the uni-
versity.” . P ‘ t

‘The idea that Hoke’s rejection may be based on activism has to at
least be considered. - A

if Henderson has a legitimate reason for rejecting Hoke -for ,

tenure, then he could save himself some trouble and reveal it. If he
has none, then he and the university deserve more than a little
grief.

THE PI'I’I' NEWS, Tuesdaz, Agril 20, 1993 V
Student protestors just don ’t get the facts about Mt. Graham 9

The Pitt News has given sizeable
press to the protestors of the Columbus
telescope project on Mount Graham in
Arizona (among them the “Friends of
Mt. Graham” and the Student
Environmental Action Coalition, or
SEAC), apparently because Pitt is con-
sidering joining the project. The com-
plaints are primarily that a species of
red squirrel native only to Mt. Graham
will be put in serious jeopardy if the
project continues, and that local
Apache Indian tribe is upset at any use
of Mt. Graham because the tribe con-
siders it sacred. However, The Pitt
News has given little space to the peo-
ple directly involved — Pitt
astronomers. We feel that the protesters
have misrepresented many of the facts
about the project and wish to present
our side to the students of the universi-
W~ .

A few of the claims of the protestors
(in no particular order) and the true
facts follow. Some of these come from
literature the protestors have been
spreading, others from personal" con-
tact. The following do not represent all
of their claims, but should constitute a
fair sample. ‘ ”

( 1) The population of the iTredlAsqt1irrel,- 

native only to Mt. Grahainis in grave
danger because of the telesc'_ope pin-.
ject.

Fact: The U.S. Forest Service has con-
cluded that there is no correlation

between the ongoing construction of
the telescope site and the population of
the red squirrel. The estimated numbers
have varied from a high of 350 in the
spring of 1986 to a low of about 150 in
the spring of 1990 and up to 400 in the
fall of 1991. Since construction has
been ongoing since before 1986, it is
doubtful that the numbers of red squir-
rels are related to construction work.
(2) The Apaches of the area are
against the project. '
Fact: The tribal

disheartening that various media,
including The Pitt News, continue to
quote the protestor’s figures as gospel.
(4) The original binocular.design of

the telescope is hopelessly ﬂawed and.

will not be implemented as planned.
Fact: Untrue; the Colombus group
still intends to build this telescope. The
proposed telescope has three innova-
tions that the layman can readily appre-
ciate: (a) the primary mirrors are spin-

1991. There are many Apaches against
the project (including some council
members), but their disapproval is not
unanimous. The Apache Survival
Coalition is the most vocal opponent of
the project, but they do not officially
represent the San Carlos tribe nor are
all of its members Native Americans.’

(3) Mt. Grahamis the worst of a total
of 38 (some say 36) surveyed on a site
selection list.

Fact: ‘This list is not a site_selection

 yarious sites (a total-.,of 59,.not-1.38): ‘MEN

meter primary mirrors, giving an effec-
tive collecting area of one 11 meter
(about 34" feet across) mirror; and (c)
the design allows for easy access to the
secondary mirrors for maintenance and

for the rapid replacement of secon-A

daries depending on experimental
requirements. ‘
(5) The total cost of the project will
exceed $200 million, and the University
of Arizona is desperate for money,
which makes Pitt’s contribution vital.
Fact: The total estimated cost is below

$60 million, more than a factor of three ‘
‘Smaller’ than '.the protesters claim. i More‘
importantly, the project already has"

enough funding to continue even"with'-
out Pitt’—s contribution. This shows a

7

basic flaw in the protesters’ local strate-
gy — the project in no way depends
upon Pitt’s involvement. Pitt has not
made a final commitment to the pro-
ject, although our astronomy faculty
has recommended the Columbus pro-
ject first on our priority list. In fact, we
do not have an unlimited amount of
time to make our decision, since the
Columbus people may well find a dif-
ferent partner in the near future.

The protestors have legitimate argu-
ments with the University of Arizona
for lightly dismissing the issues, and
indeed UA could have shown more
sensitivity. Yet this does not detract
from the central issue that the protes-
tors have been running a disinforma-
tion campaign on this campus. In part,
because the local protestors are not as
important as they like to think most of
the astronomers here ignore them and
simply wish they would go away. I
admit ‘to feeling this way to some
extent myself, but I also feel it is impor-
tant that we do not allow the protestors
to be the only voice on concerning the
Columbus project heard by Pitt stu-
dents. As far as the protestors are con-
cerned, they will earn a“respected voice
only if they stick to the facts and‘ avoid
cooking ‘up numbers’ to’ ‘serve ‘tlie"ir pur-
poses."  ” A  A

Please don't hate me because I belong to the majority

I am a white American male. I
am also an individual. , .

Being of this nationality, skin
color and gender, I am part of the
majority in this country, and there-
fore, I’ll start oil’ by admitting that.I
do not understand some of the

problems that affect minorities in A

the United States.

But beyond the way I look, I am
still an individual. I have dreams
and aspirations just like many of
the individuals that do not look
like me. I also face the everyday
problems in this world and in this
country that many face.

However, I do not face-the
racism that is prevalent in America.
America is still a patriarchal and
racist society that favors people
like me. I offer no solutions to this
problem, except time. Time has
continually shown that minorities
have made great strides in a soci-
ety that has not easily accepted
them.

But “time” is a concept that
members of radical minority and
feminist groups overlook. They
also see past my individuality and

‘see only three things — a white

American male. In other words, an
imperialist, racist and oppressor.

Yes, I am a white American
male, but I am also an individual. It
is this point exactly that many‘ radi-
cal minority and feminist move-
ments don’t understand.

I am a person in the  I‘

am a person who grew up not in a
rich_ or poor section of America but
in the middle. I. arna part of the tra-
ditional suburban middle class
community and family.

0 My dad worked hard every day
and came home from work so
tired he could only eat supper and

fall asleep. My mother was at

home and did all the cleaning and
cooking. She woke up in the
mornings and made my dad
breakfast and packed his lunch
every day.

0 My older sister and brother have
jobs in this society and both work
hard. Often, my whole family
would workon Saturdays cleaning
up our yard full of autumn leaves.

- I worked odd jobs through high
school and studied hard to attend
college. In one more year I will be
the first person in my family to

attain a bachelors degree.

Why say all this, you may ask?
Well, as an individual I do not
come from America’s wealthy and
elite,=nor do I come from this
country’s poor and downtrodden.
I was raised on a strict, hard work
ethic and I was taught to treat peo-
ple respectfully. ’

'But I guess that is not enough
for the many radical minority

— Cory

groups that look beyond my indi-
vidual background. I feel I treat
people with dignity, no matter
their nationality, color or gender. I
feel I treat them as equals to
myself. But I do not feel treated as
an equal by many radical people
that label me and disregard the
person that lies inside.

Coming from a Protestant, con-
servative background, my values
often disagree with many minority
groups. These values may be con-
sidered “wrong” by some. But,
again, I am a person and my views

should not be regarded as hog‘-
wash.
Life is not always easy for indi-

viduals. Problems must be. .over.- ‘
come-' to be able to live ..w.-ith. some: 

kind of peace of mind. I worry
about my place in society, my
schoolwork, my writing and what
life holds in store for me. I was
taught to work hard and things will
come to those who carry on this
way. But things do not always
blossom for hard-working individ-
uals, Whether they be black, white,
male or female. That is a problem
everyone has to overcome in his or
her own way.

I feel that working hard in any-
thing might be an answer for the
individual in the 19905. Prejudice
still abounds, but things are getting
better for minorities in this nation. I
would like to know that I could
succeed in the United ‘States not
because I am a white American
male, but because I’m a hard
working person.

So what about making my life
better? It sounds really selfish, and
you might think that it sounds very
hypocritical coming from a white

American male’s perspective, but I
still have to find my individual
niche in this world. My life is not

"on ‘easy street simply because’ of

my  coloror sexy   =1?

’ To the ‘raclid1ls’of the world-’—— I i

wish to be viewed as an individual
like most people wish for. I would
like to be allowed to work hard
and see if I can make the best for

. myself, my family and for my chil-

dren to come.

Must I pay for my cultures past
mistakes? No, I am a person that
must be seen as an individual that
is not an imperialist, racist or sexist
man An individual that is trying his
best in this world to be treat every-
one as his equal.

I am proud of this country and I

am proud of who I am. If the radi- -

cal racists and feminists could just
learn to respect someone like
myself, who happens to be the
white American male, then maybe
the United States would prosper
for everyone and ‘my point would
not be irrelevant.

trading with Cuba?” First of all, we
are not a “democracy.” The word
democracy has traditionally meant
unlimited majority rule, e.g. ancient
Arhers. The founders of our county

sought to proted the

tions of the gover:nrnent to the pro-
tection of individual rights. They

called this system a “republic.” _

(Notice that the word “democracy”
does not appear in the Declaration
of Independence, the Constitution

1 or the Bill of Rights.)

Secondly, (without expressing my
opinion on the embargo) Professor
Lobel should know that the concept
of “free trade” refers to two or more
voluntary traders. In Cuba, voluntary
traders are treated as dangerous

cons of the proposed center.

The vote“, with two board
members absent, went 5-1,
with Tom Grassia dissenting.
Grassia said he was for a cen-
ter but had a problem with the
wording of the resolution.

Grassia questioned whether
Pitt’s retention rates for African
Americans were deficient in
comparison with other major
universities.

He said he had seen a study
that placed Pitt second among
predominantly white universi-
ties for African-American
retention rates.

Brody asked Grassia if he
had this. information present,
but Grassia said hehadlnot
expected to be voting on the

‘wording of the resolution last ’

‘night.

The Board’s second resolu- 3
tion. came after members of

the Student Environmental
Action Coalition and other
concerned students requested
several months ago that SGB
take a stance on the Mount
Graham telescope project.

The University of Arizona-
based project has been under
fire from activists and Apache
tribes for its ecological and
religious conflicts.

Though Pitt is not yet
involved in more than specu-

lation on the project, SGB“

responded to A Sl3AC’s request
and urged administration to
further ‘investigate other possi-
ble sites for the astronomy

‘study, because: ,
,-The Mount Graham site

resulted in “great controversy
relating to the ambiguous

' nature of its financing.”

-Other major institutions have
pulled out from considering

Mount Graham for the tele- 9

scope project.
-The site is culturally and his-

torically important to the

Apache nation.

-”There are too many other
ambiguities involved with
Mount Graham, which war-
rants a closer look at the other
possible telescope sites.”

The Board faced a third
issue as representatives from
the Campus \X/omen’s
Organization asked for student
government support in relo-

cating their group to a’ better
office facility. 5 ‘

“At this time there is little or
no support for women on
campus,” CWO member Shira
Hassan said. “lC\X/'Ol does not
even have a mailing address.”

Member Jenna Ferrara
said that Pitt’s \X/omen’s
Studies program is the only
phone number in the universi-
ty directory for women’s con-
cerns.

“We would like an office
with a telephone, so that we
can start a support service to
take some of the weight off
them,” she said.

Ferrara said thatboth BAS
and the BiGALA groups “have
and deserve office space, but
the constituency that [CWO]

represents is twice as large as
theirs.”

Brody said that he would.
work with CWO over the sum-
mer on acquiring the space.

Last night’s meeting was the
last of this term for SGB.
Several members will work
over the summer and all mem-
bers will return in the fall for
the second half of their elected
term, but SGB Chairpersons
and committees will undergo a
changing of the guardsnext
month.

Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team used
strong relief pitching to record
the first Big East sweep at
home in school history as it
defeated the Seton Hall Pirates
10-6 yesterday.

The victory was the third
straight for the Panthers (24-5,
7-3 in Big East play), who took
the first two over the Pirates
(16-13, 4-7) on Sunday,
putting them in second place
in conference and a half game
out of first place.

“It’s an accomplishment —-
it’s somethingthat a Pitt team
has never done before,”
Panther head coach Mark
Jackson said of the sweep.

“I was here last year when
the program was just decent,
and it feels so great to win,”
pitcher Greg Mrochko said.
“It’s great to see everybody do
well. It’s the best feeling I’ve
probably ever had.”  '

With Mrochko picking up
the save for winning pitcher
Mickey Vincent, the Panthers
pounded out 10 hits, including
two towering home runs, to
send the Pirates to their 13th
defeat of the season.

Despite the fact that ace
Jason Rakers started the game
in hopes of sealing the three-
game series, Jackson had to
resort to his bullpen relatively
early. Rakers lasted only two
and two-thirds innings before
Jackson was forced to make

the switch to Vincent.

“He just got too pumped up
out there,” Jackson said of
Rakers. “We talked about how
this would be Pitt’s first sweep
and how every game would be
important and he just
wasn’t real focused on what he
was doing.”

The combination of Vincent
and Mrochko, however, was
stifling for Pitt. With the duo
allowing only one run over the
final six and one-third innings,
Jackson had to make no fur-
ther moves to the pen.

“If Jason didn’t have it, then
we were going to try to piece
it together [out of the bullpen]
and we were able to do that
with the pitching staff,"
Jackson said. “lMrochkol gave
a different look [than Rakers
and Vincent] and he threw
well. He really wanted‘ it, too.
He was real composed out

I there and did a good job.”

“I was throwing a fastball,

land. a slider,” Mrochtko said;  

just put my slider on the out-
side corner on all the lefties
and I think they were having a
little trouble picking it up — I
don’t think they could pick the
spin up on it.

“I felt great and everything
and I pitched pretty well, but I
have to give all the credit to
the hitters. We just kept beat-
ing the ball.”

Pitt beat the ball to five extra
base hits and seven runs in the
last five innings, garnering its

G alie Spitzer named rookie of the year

It had all the makings of
a roadtrip from hell.

fresh from back-to-back

to California (Pa.) State
and Bucknell — were
New England—bound for a
pair of Big East
Conference games against
Providence and Boston

Pegged to finish dead
last in 1992 after going _O-
6-2 the previous year, the
Panthers were in dire
need of an inspiring effort
from someone — anyone

something big from some

Hockey gums pic/e the Campbell conferenceﬁrst round

Smythe Division

(1) Vancouver Canucks vs.
(4) Winnipeg Jets

This is the most eirciting first-
round matchup as it pits two of
the league’s top young studs
against each other.

In Winnipeg, all the talk is
about Teemu Selanne, the most
exciting rookie since Mario
Lemieux. The Finnish Flash has
used an incredible blend of
speed, agility, grace and hockey
talent to obliterate nearly every
rookie scoring record in the
books.

Vancouver’s second-year sen-
sation Pavel Bure — though
going through a minor slump -
has been every bit as impressive
as he was last year when he was
the NHL Rookie of the Year. He,
along with captain Trevor
Linden, Cliff Ronning and
Murray Craven round out an
impressive scoring punch.

In goal, Bob Essensa of
Winnipeg is consistently one of
the league’s best, though he is
untested in the postseason. Kirk
McLean of Vancouver will use
his ‘playoff "experience to its full

advantage.

Ultimately, a one—man team
cannot win a playoff series. So
in the hard-fought battle
between Team Teemu and the
Russian Rocket, playoff experi-
ence and a stronger defense will
prevail. Canucks in seven.

(2) Calgary Flames vs. (3)
Los Angeles Kings

The Flames have rebounded H
nicely from a dismal 1991-'92
season when they didn’t make
the playoffs. The Kings, one the
other hand, have been largely
inconsistent this year —- with or
without Wayne Gretzky.

Both teams are evenly
matched offensively, with
Calgary holding an edge in goal

‘ and on defense. Much-maligned

Flames goalie Mike Vernon has

a Stanley Cup to his credit and a.

postseason record of 59-28. His
counterpart, Kelly Hrudey, has a
long tradition of folding when it
counts.

Neither team is strong defen-
sively, but Calgary’s Gary Suter
and Al Maclnnis far outrnatch
Los Angeles’ lone notable, Rob
Blake. Overall, Calgary’s blue *

 

  

   

liners provide more offense and
better defense.

Sure, the Kings still have
Gretzky up front, but stick
mammoth Joel Otto in his face

Tom
Schneider;

and expect a quiet round from
“The (Not-So) Great One.” The
Kings also have Jimmy Carson,
Tony Granato and Jarri Kurri to
pick up the slack.

The scoring is dead even with
the Kings having record—break—
ing left winger Luc Robitaille —
who broke Steve Shutt’s 16-
year-old record of most goals in
a season by a left winger this
season. The Flames’ go—to guys

(1) Chicago Blackhawks
vs. (4) St. Louis Blues

If St. Louis wins this series,
you better get ready to see ﬂy-

_ ing cows and snowballs in hell

‘cause the Blues are truly awful.

' The only reason they’re in the

show is because Minnesota has
played worse than they have
down the stretch.

For a gunner who led the
league in goals the past three
years, Brett Hull had a tough
time finding the net this season,
scoring well below his career
average. One hundred-point
scorer Craig Jamey may have
had a career year, but he’s had a
bad reputation of choking when
the going gets tough. Ditto for
winger Brendan Shanahan.

Meanwhile, the Hawks were
in the finals last year, so that
alone speaks of their perfor-
mance-come crunch time. But
scoring is not this team’s forte.

and Michel Goulet both had dis-
appointing seasons, neither '
scoring more than 75 points.

On defense, the Chicago duo
of Chris Chelios and Steve Smith
are two of the league's most

' physical players as well as

being able to put the puck in '
the net. St. Louis, on the other
hand, has defensemen who
move the puck well such as Jeff
Brown and Doug Crossman, but
they also check like a couple of
figure skaters.

The matchup in net will be
very competitive. The Blues’
Curtis Joseph has had a strong
season while Chicago’s Ed
Belfour is the probable Vezina
Trophy winner.

Bottom line: While Joseph
will be able to keep the Blues
close he won’t be able to win
games for them. Hawks in four.

six extra points in Pitt’s first
game of the season —— a 51-10
trouncing of Kent State. He
also showed the powerful leg
on kickoffs that limited
opposing kick return units all
season.

In his only year of eligibility
at Pitt, Conley nailed 16 of 19
field goal attempts and 27 of
31 extra points. His penchant
for perfection in the field-goal
department was not limited to
chip shots: Conley connected
on nine field goals of 40 yards
or more, including a career-
long 48-yarder against Notre
Dame.

Pat Wiltanger —— Wrestling

for the Panthers this year,
Wiltanger combined an
impressive 24-8 record with a
clutch performance at the

Tournament to earn him a trip

After a fine dual—meet sea-

seeded fourth entering the
EWL Tournament. Wiltanger
surprised everyone by knock-
ing off top-seeded Jeff
Scherma of Cleveland State in
the semi-finals en. route to a
second place finish. The man
they call “Wilt” was on his

Working with former Pitt
All-American Perry Miller last
season, Wiltanger gained valu-

This year, the Panthers and

Toronto doesn’t have the scor-

Rookie

Continued from page 11
a sore shoulder, rookie middle
hitter Yanik gave the Pitt vol-
leyball team more than a gutty
performance in ‘92 —— she
gave them a gifted player in
the middle.

Yanik, who finished the sea-
son with 189 kills and 57 digs,
put forth quite an effort.
Raising her hitting percentage
from a low .056 midway
through the season to a
respectable .184 by the end,
Yanik worked through the
pain.

“She worked with phenome-
nal pain,” Pitt assistant coach
Cindy Braziel said. “She is the
quickest middle hitter I’ve
seen.”

Yanik and three other first-
year players were the key to
the Panthers late—season Big
East Championship run.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 20, 1995 . ' 

Spitzer
Continued from page 9
starter Kirk‘ Brodows in the
second half of Pitt’s 3-2 loss to
the aforementioned Bisons.
Just a scant three weeks
removed from his summer
vacation in Morganville, N.J.,
the rookie netminder would
draw the assignment of
thwarting both Providence
and powerful Boston College
in the same weekend — both
in front of a nationally tele-

vised audience.
He would not disappoint.

Led by Spitzer’s confident"

play in net, the unknown
Panthers gained not only their
first conference win since
1990 —— a 3-1 win over the
Friars on Friday —— they
would sweep the road trip by
upsetting the favored Golden
Eagles, 1-0. Spitzer’s play,
particularly in the BC game,
served as a defining moment
for the overachieving Pitt
squad. The Panthers would go
10-4-1 the rest of the season
en route to the greatest soccer
season in school history.
While the play of the rookie
goalie throughout the season
was nothing short of top-shel.f
—— a 12-4-1 record and a
goals-against-average of 0.71

A attest to that contention — the

moxy and confidence exuded
by Spitzer during that first
roadtrip left a marked impres-
sion on his head coach.

“I was impressed by how he
handled our first big roadtrip
of the year — particularly the
BC game,” Pitt Coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “He gained a
lot of confidence and respect
off that performance.

“The fact that he played so
well in his first games — both
tough road games — showed
me a lot. He might have had
butterflies, but he didn’t show

it."
If Spitzer did have a case of

the nerves, in either the first
weekend or the remainder of
the season,he_ sure didn’t
show it. By the time the ‘92
season had come to a close,
Spitzer had set a new mark
for most wins in a season with
12. He also claimed share of
the Pitt record for most
shutouts in a season (10),
tying the mark set by his
goalie coach, David Torrence,
in 1985.

“While'I knew he had the
ability, I didn’t expect him to
take chaige like he did,”
Luxbacher said. “The team
quickly gained confidence in
him. Our defenders weren't
afraid to make mistakes.

“He’s a good man, he works
hard and he always wants to
get better.”

For the benchwarmer
turned record-breaker, the

expectations and realities of
his exciting frosh campaign
was nothing more than
making the most of the
opportunity presented to him.
Nothing calculated. Just good
timing.

“When I first came in, I
wasn't sure if I was going to
play,” Spitzer said. “I got
lucky, got a break, and made
the most of my chances.”

As for the early season
nerves? Spitzer admits to hav-
ing a few jitters — particularly
in the BC game. But as any-
one responsible for the last
line of defense will admit, a
slight case of anxiety is a pre-
requisite for the gig,

“You're always on your toes
during the game -— trying to
be aware of everything in
front of you," Spitzer said.

‘ Despite his positive nervous

energy, Spitzer rarely lost his
cool in pressure situations. He
credits his backline team-
mates with keeping him at
even keel when things got
hectic on the field. “The
defenders helped me keep my
head up during a game,”
Spitzer said.

With a year of superior,

goaltending firmly etched in
the Pitt soccer record books,
Spitzer already has a top-
flightlist of goals for his
sophomore campaign. They

include: first-team All-Big East _

Conference honors, a return
trip to the league final four
and a berth in the NCAA
Tournament.

His priority?

“I want the team to win.
The team is the most impor-
tant thing to me,” he said.

While quips of team play

sound all well and good in
the optimism-drenched month
of April, how will that trans-
late when the games being in
early September? Spitzer said
he doesn’t know that answer,
but he does know one thing:
Pitt won’t surprise anyone this
time ‘round.

“It'll definitely be more dif-
ficult,” Spitzer said. “Just
hanging around with a lot of
Seton Hall players back home,
you can tell they’ll take us
seriously next year.

“This year against Seton
Hall [Pitt won, 3-2], that was
«one game where people
didn’t respect us. They didn’t
take us seriously.

“Next year, they’ll know
we're ﬁghters.”

And they’ll know about a
Jersey boy named Adam
Spitzer.
