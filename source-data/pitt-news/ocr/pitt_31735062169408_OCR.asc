UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Dr. Goodman Outlines the

by BERNI MoLEOD

Dr. Paul Goodman, Wednes-
day’s Public Affairs speaker, re-
minded the audience that 50
years ago they would have been
out in the factories rather than
sitting there listening to him. He
noted that the unique “error” of
our age is masses “nests of young
people” into universities, from
which they derive very little.

At the noon meeting in the SU
ballroom, Dr. Goodman addressed
a capacity crowd on the faults
of modern American universities.
He felt that one of the big prob-
lems is the extent of governmen-
tal and corporate pressure on

~ students and faculty.

“MIT is 80 per cent supported
by government funds,” said Dr.
Goodman, “and Columbia is at
least 40 per cent. All the giant
schools are in the same boat. The
more intelligent the student, the
more disgusted he is at this con-
trol.” 

According to Dr. Goodman, uni-
versities also mis-educate more
students than they educate.
“These institutions,” he argued,
“have expanded themselves with

902 Wins;
Profit Is  
Doubled

Alpha Phi Omega, men’s serv-
ice honorary, awarded this year’s
Ugly Man on Campus (UMOC)
placque to 902 Brackenridge. The
contest ended with the ﬁnal judg-
ing at the dance Saturday night
in the SU ballroom.

This year’s contest grossed
twice as much as last year. The
funds will be used to support
the honorary’s foster child in
Ecuador. The remaining funds
will be contributed to the Hemo-
philia Society of Allegheny Coun-
ty,-and to leukemia research.

Besides the placque, 902 was
also awarded the trophy for top
money in its division and a spir-
it award—a ﬁrst in the UMOC
for their outstanding enthusiasm
throughout the contest.

The overall judging was based
on ugliness of face and costume,
durability of the costume, time
and effort devoted to entry, and
number of money-votes. The Cir-
cle K and Brackenridge-Panther
entrants were over-all runners-
1113.

Delta Phi Epsilon drew the
most money with Zeta Beta Tau
and 901 Brackenridge following
their lead.

The finalists in the three con-
test divisions for the placque
were the Greeks: Delta Phi Epsi-
lon, Zeta Beta Tau, and Sigma
Delta Tau; dorms: 902 Bracken-
ridge, Mad House, and Bracken-
ridge-Panther House; and organ-
izations: Circle K, Glee Club, and
Chemical Engineers.

the pretensions to educate 50 per
cent of American youth. Every-
one argues that high technolo-
gies need such trained people.
This is a lot of hog wash.”

Dr. Goodman feels that an aca-
demic education is not the best
education for, the great majority
of people. “Most bright and aver-
age people don’t learn that way,”
he said. They must have real ac-
tivities at which they get actual
t.raining—a college radio or TV
station, a newspaper, social work
activities. .

The college youth community
is also not given responsibility, in
Dr-.‘Goodman’s estimation. Deans
and state boards set up so many
requirements, interfere with
their interests, and “make them
go to classes.”

Flaws of Many Universities

Dr. Goodman also feels that uni-
versities, as professional schools
fail miserably. They do not pro-
duce autominous individuals, such
as professionals have been for
ages, but instead produce men
who cooperate with the “front
office.”

Of the large numbers of stu-
dents now attending American
universities, Dr./“Goodman esti-
mates that perhaps 30-40 per cent
don’t want to be there. They re
main, however, for the hope of a
decent job upon graduation, the
lack of anything better to do, the

xeans of dodging the draft, or
for the opportunity of stalling in
order to “ﬁnd oneself.”

Dr. Goodman doesn’t feel that
any of these are good "enough
reasons.

$11 Million Approved  
For Dorm Construction,
Quadrangle Planning   

(See Editorial: The Dorms
Are Your Project, 112. 4)

Over $11 million Worth of
loans and appropriations for
construction and planning at
the University were approv-
ed by the General State Au-
thority, Tuesday.

According to Chancellor
David Kurtzman, $8.5 mil-
lion of the total which Was
appropriated by the 1965 state
legislature is a loan for construc-
tion of the proposed dormitories
above the‘ Stadium.

Dr. Hamilton Speaks '

by ROBERT ZAVOS

The phrase “Death of God” is
“an insane, journalistic pseudo-
event,” according to Dr. William
Hamilton, professor of theology
and religion at the University of
Rochester. Speaking on “Radical
Theology and the Implications
' for Ethics” Tuesday, he contin-
' ued, “Fortunately, the right peo-
ple were offende_d—it bothered
the establishment.”

Before discussing the issue of
ethics at this fourth lecture in
the Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation
series, he asked whether the
phrase “Death of God” was>real—
lyservicable. “The answer is ‘yes’
if youconsider it next to its ac-
tual context — poetry,” he ex-
plained.

“The idea is actually quite old
if we look into literature and poe-
try,” he noted, “and it was at
least 100 years old when Niet-
che’s madman ran into the town
square.

“But even more crucial is the
quest ‘What God is dead?”’ pro-
claimed Dr. Hamilton. “Is it the
God of the New Testament or the
Christian God or the God of
scripture? VVe have just begun to
ask what islthe meaning of the
word ‘God.\”’

Dr. Hamilton suggested that
people are confusing the function
‘of the word with the concept.
Dr. Hamilton believes there is
evidence in the Bible to show
that the word God invites us to-
place ourselves in the world in a
speciﬁc way. He implied that God
is not an entity up in the sky, but
rather a way of looking at the
world. If this is the case, then
the Death of God is irrelevant,

‘Death of God’ Phrase Insane

  

DR. WILLIAM HAMILTON speaks as pm of a panel on the
“Death of God.”

and we will now be able to move
into a post-Christian age.

He then asked, “Where will our
ethical and social ethics come
from? If there ‘is no God, are all
things permitted as Ivan Kara-
mazov states in the Brothers
Karamazov?” Dr. Hamilton ex-
plained that ethical values will
not be lost, just because people
no longer believe in the tradi-
tional God. If we look around us,
we see that there are many so-
called believers who are moral-
ly irresponsible and there are
many non-believers who are mor-
ally responsible. The empirical
evidence shows that belief in God

is deﬁnitely not related to ~pos- .

sessing personal and social ethics.
Ethics will come from the indi-
vidual, just as it always has.

Dr. Hamilton believes that a
second important problem result-
ing from the Death of God is the
question, “Where are commun-
it-ies going to come from?” Just
as the question, “Who is God?”
has been answered, so also has
the question, “Who am I?” been
answered by persons like Freud

Dr. Robert Efron, whose re-
search on the nervous system has
evoked much interest among phil-
osophers and psychologists, will

and Sartre. Now we must ask,
“Who are you?”
Dr. Hamilton sees the emerg-

ing communities as the answer

to the third question. He does
not believe it is possible to des-
cribe the communities exactly,
but he sees the growing impor-
tance of institutions like the uni-
versities and decreasing impor-
tance of the family.

Graduates Fight Poverty

by LIZ CIAVARRA

Men and women around the
world are up in arms against pov-
erty and University students are

,no exception. Morton Coleman,

assistant secretary to the Mayor,
working with Manpower, stated
that the Graduate School of So-

cial Work is taking an active

part.

Graduate students, such as Dor-
is Herron, who is working in the
inayor’.s office, are working on
the development of education and
training for destitute persons.
This is mainly done through a
self-help program. Charles‘ Green
and Ed Swartz, also working with
the mayor, are interested in
health and employment and all

Dr. Marsh
Sees Change
In China

Changing social patterns in Chi-
na is the topic for the fourth

ii..a series of social science lec-1"
tures sponsored by the Univer-

si.ty’s Department of Anthropolo-
gy. Dr. Robert Marsh of Duke
University will speak Friday,
March 3, on “Evolution and Rev-
olution: Two Types of Change in
China’s Stratiﬁcation System.”

Associate professor of sociolo-
gy at Duke University, Dr. Marsh
has conducted ﬁeld research in
Hcng Kong and Taiwan, and has
published articles and books on
Chinese history and sociology.

social services.

Through these efforts, previous-
ly unemployed people are now
earning a living for themselves
in jobs outside the poverty pro-
gram as well as working within
it. Family service agencies are
working in all neighborhoods, as
are health and legal services.

There are aged people in th-e
Lower North Side with incomes
less than $1,000 a year. The aver-
age income for these people is
less than $3,000 a year. Beverly
Lovelice, another graduate stu-
dent, is helping with senior citi-
zen’s programs which provide
work forthe aged.

The unemployment rate of peo-
ple between the ages of 16 and
20 is three times higher than the
normal rate: The unemployment
rate of the Negro is six or seven
times higher. The drop-out rate
is as high as 50 per cent.

To help reduce these rates, the
University, Carnegie Tech, and
Mount Mercy are working with
the Upward Bound Program un-
cier the Pittsburgh Community
Action Program. Two hundred

students will be recruited from-
‘ the eight poverty neighborhoods

to attend classes in English, bio-
logy, and math this summer at
the three schools.

Fifty high school students from
these neighborhoods resided at
the University in the summer
and attended classes once a.
month during the winter. They
have been taking part in special
educational, cultural, social, and
counseling Dl‘08’rams aimed at
preparing the student to enter

.-but are also alienated

and remain in college.

Coleman said that the under-
privileged not only lack money
and iso-
lated from society. This creates
psychological and social problems
which the workers are trying to
eliminate.

In the poverty-stricken areas,
posters relating the news are
hung on the streets for those who
can read. One of these, North-
siders on the Move, is published
by the Northside Committee on
Human Resources, a citizens
group for community action.

These papers talk to the peo-
ple in language they can under-
stand. Headlines read: “Cool That
Constable,” “That’s Family Serv-
ice, Man,” and “It’s Endsville for
Eighth Street.” Articles instruct
people how to make their homes
more livable, where they can re-
ceive information about jobs, ed-
ucation, health, housing, family
service, and legal aid.

During the summer, city offi-
cials were taken on a tour of the
slum areas. Rat infested, window-
less shacks were everywhere.
Work is now being done to re-
juvenate the neighborhood. Cole-
man stated, “There are 50,000
people in the city living under
less than adequate conditions for
health and safety.”

When asked the reason for the
condition of these areas, Cole-
man stated, “Because of discrim-
ination, inadequate training and
education, these people are not
productive in today‘s society and
must be lead to become oriented
in today’s world.’’

‘Frick’s Attorney
he-A-Qlarifies Stand

Editor, The Pitt News:
_ A ‘If in your issue of Feb. 13 you
" have correctly reported the state-
‘-ment‘ ' of Chancellor Kurtzman,
'3-tlren I am obliged to say that he
‘is simply not accurate.
It is not true that Miss Frick “de-
manded” that Professor Loerke
,_ and Dean Wadsworth “be ﬁred.”
;_On the contrary, both Chancellor
,Litchﬁeld and Chancellor Kurtz-
‘”-‘man told me that they would be
happy to see Loerke leave, but
--that they could not discharge .him
_C'«_becaus_e he had tenure. All that
7, Miss. Frick “demanded” with re-
-%spect to Loerke was that the
University abide by its agree-
rment that he continue to have his
office in the Cathedral of Learn-
" 'ng rather than the Fine Arts
‘ Building. This agreement as to.
his office was proposed in writing
- by Chancellor Litchﬁeld on Nov.
1 11, ' 1964, and by Vice-Chancellor
I-Peake on Feb. 16, 1966, and April
, 9, 1965. And it was included in
 , he written agreement of June
,,16, .1965, as a result of which
j’ the University got Miss Frick to
"give it money. -
So, when Chancellor Kurtzman
says that the decision with re-
‘gard to Professor Loerke was
merely a verbal agreement with
Chancellor I..itchﬁeld, he is not
accurate. The written agreement,
ig‘ned""by. Chancellor Litchﬁeld,
attested by the University Secre-
ary" Stanton Crawford, and ini-
iated-?by Vice-Chancellor -Peake,
provides at page nine:
1 -‘_‘The ﬁne arts departmental

ired to obstruct any agreement

rary to its promises, the Uni-

Dorms

The ‘Commonwealth has cleared the way for the construction of the
“new dormitories on the hill. It is just a matter of time until architects will
‘ibe hired and plans will be drawn up for the new resident halls. We feel
. that because these buildings Will be for use ohly by students, there is no
H’ reason Why student opinion about the facilities in the dorms should not be
included at every step of the planning stage. .
__ Because of the unusual location of the dormitories in relation to the
I _:Towers and Quadrangle, there are many pressing questions concerning the ,
provisions made in the new buildings. For example students should be per-
mitted» to express their opinion aboutthe cafeteria services. When‘ the
plans for the dorms on the hill were first announced, it was stated by the
‘ _administration that only men would be living in the residence halls. The
fl administration also said that those living in the dorms would eat in a cafe-
 teria. in the building. It is obvious that such an arrangement could isolate
 the men at meal ‘time from the Women students living on the lower campus.
 ‘ Students should beinformed about what provisions are being made
-for bus service to the “upper campus.” If the present service is not im-
proved the transportation problems for the residents of the new dormi-
tories could be intolerable. There are also questions about What sort of

side the University should have
controh. over faculty.” The issue
is whether the University will
keep its promises.

Attorney to Miss Frick

Student Questions
New Implications
Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News of Feb. 20 of-

fers a sad commentary on the
state of the University. A great

deal of space was devoted to a ,

discussion ‘of the increase in dorm
fees and the decrease in service-.
This discussion included state-
ments by the administration, the
supposed student leaders, and
The Pitt News, yet no one dealt
with the real implications of this
action. The reason the adminis-
tration did not speak of them is

obvious: they did not want to »

cause the uproar which was sure
to come’ if the truth were clear
to everyone. Why The Pitt News
and the Student Government ad-
ministration did not speak of it

is a matter which is better left

to conjecture.

Mr. Smith came closest to the
truth when he said, “This view
does not recognize that the state
did not provide a tuition subsidy
to be used to support dormitory

and maid services far in excess»

oi those provided at Penn State
or at other institutions in the
Commonwealth.” Note that it is
not the fact that the money is
used for dorm and maid services,
bit rather it is the amount of such
service that is objectionable. This

' is indeed the crux of the’ mat-

ter. The University has been us-
ing general funds to offset the
deﬁct in _ the running of‘ the
dorms. This year, however, as-
the administration planned next
year’s budget, they learned, via
Pitt graduates in Harrisburg, that
the state legislature would not
vote funds unless there was a
decrease in maid service or an
increase in dorm fees to about
$500 a term. p

The administration, to its cred-
it. recognized that a dorm fee of
this size would deter, to say the

least, out-of-state students from

coming here. Hence, it increased
dormfees $40 and cut maid serv-
ice, so that now costs will be

close enough to income to allow‘

the use of general funds to- make
up the deﬁcit. The reason the
state legislature gave for not al-
lowing the University to use gen-
eral funds to make up the deﬁit
was that no other state school
has so much dorm‘ service and
Pitt should .not either.

I can sympathize with those
who are upset by administrative
fiets, but a much greater danger
to the University community lies
in the area of legislative ﬁat to
what is supposedly still, essential-
ly a private university. For those
of us who sat through meetings
where Dr. Kurtzman assured us

-that Harrisburg would have no

direct control over the University
because “they would have less

“than one-third of the Board of

Trustees,” this turn of events is
very disconcerting. This action
leads one to questions about
whether Pitt will have to be-
come like the ‘other state schools

in other areas as well.

Will Pitt be unable to recruit
good professors because we can’t
pay higher salaries than the other
state schools? Will Pitt be un-
able to keep or lower its teacher-
student ratio because it is lower
than that of other state schools?
These are questions which both
the faculty and students should
ask themselves, while bearing in
mind that Harrisburg has just
dictated University policy in an
area which does not directly re-
ceive their money. What they
will dictate in those areas which
do beneﬁt directly from their
money, such as professors’ sal-
aries, is anyone’s guess. Suffice’it
to say that a dangerous prece-
dent -is set when an outside body
is allowed to create University
policy. 6

There are two courses of ac-
tion which I would recommend
to those who would like to worry
about this. First, the University
community, faculty, students, and
maybe even those who call them-
selves student leaders, no matter
what their party, should formu-

late an educational policy (some- »

thing which has been lacking
for the past two years) and then
agree to defend this policy against
encroachment from Harrisburg.
Second, Pennsylvania residents
and their parents should protest
this interference in education by

room arrangements will be made in the dorms. Often we hear complaints
that the -three walls in the Towers’ rooms leading to claustrophobia. Stu-
dents should be allowed to tell the Chancellor and the University planning
board about experiences such as these. 

The administration should also want to know exactly What recreational
facilities students would like to have in the new dorms. They should review
with students the problems residents have faced with the facilities offered
in the Towers andthe women’s dormitories in the.Quadrangle.

Ultimately the administration should not have to come to the students.
The elected leaders of the student body who meet with the Chancellor
should be prepared with well constructive s-uggestions for the plans. They
should meet with the representatives that sit on their various councils to
determine what are their top priority objectives. Throughout the entire
year the student leaders of 1966-1967 worked for involvement in decisions
affecting student life. The crucial issue for next year is the construction
of the dorms on the hill. If student efforts are t-0 be well spent, the elected
leaders shouldorganize their thoughts and insist upon the incorporation of
their proposals. into the ﬁnal blueprints.

groups on campus, like SG, feel
that petitions are the solution to
all problems. In this case, how-
ever, 50 two paragraph letters
sent by individuals to individual
legislators are more effective than
thousands of signatures sent to

Penn State closes the Panther basketball team’s home
season tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 p.m. The cagers are
hoping that the Field House, where they are 4-6, can some-
how make up the 40 point edge the Nittany Lions’ enjoyed

in their first encounter.

.The Lions won that one, 84-44, in the most lopsided

game in the series’ 61 year his-
tory. At the time, it was State’s
30th co1’,_,'_{‘l,1.l'?.'e home victory.
Syracuse s;\n:-ippsd the string two

‘ games later, perhaps pointing out

the difference between this year's
10-12 team and coach John Eg_li’s
tournament clubs of the previous
two seasons.

But Panther coach Bob Tim-
mons, after watching Penn State
destroy his squad that January
afternoon, could only speak fav-
orably about State’s current ball-
players. He had seen sophomore

*Bill Stansﬁeld score 25 points and

grab 11 rebounds in 20 minutes.
He had seen his defense stymie
State’s Jeff Persson, only to have
two reserve guards, Joe McGov-
ern and Garry Hayes, hit for 14
points apiece. _
Persson has since recovered
from that _season low of six
points to average 18 a game.
Stansﬁeld -adds nearly 16, and
the Lions’ 6-9 center, Paul Mick-

ey, contributes 11. Mickey and.

Stansﬁeld (6-8) -also provide the
one-two rebounding punch.

“We couldn’t stop those two
from getting in close to take the
second and third shots,” Tim-
mons reﬁected on the earlier

less. “That beat us as much as
anything else.”*

Another thing that didn’t help
was Egli’s ability to go to his
bench and get points. The Lions’
substitutes outscored their eager
counterparts, 26-0.

If the ﬁrst Penn State game
was the cagers? worst affair of
the year, Wednesday night’s de-
bacle Vith Temple ranks a close
second.

The Owls bombed the Pan-
thers, 87-49, at the Palestra. Tem-
ple led 6-0 in the opening mo-
ments, expanded it to 17-9, and;
putkthe game out of reach, 41-18,
at the end _of the ﬁrst half.

Ken Bollens managed 14 points
in the midst of the onslaught,
with none of the other cagers in

double ﬁgures. They had one of 5»

their worst shooting nights of the
year, 22 for 74, while Temple
connected on 38 of’ 76.

Thus, the Panthers lost their
11th game on the road against
just one win. v

The questioninow is: Can the — I

musty Field House and a tradi-
tional rival invigorate a dying
basketball team?

State has-consistently scored in
the 180’s which is about 40 points
better that the gymnasts’ average.

Last Tuesday night, the gym-

of the season, defeating West Vir-

it in pop. In rock. In folk

    “I’ve ironed my hair...tried lots of torchery
  things to get rid of natural curl.” r

(This is how Dee Dee Dolan looked before using
CURL FREE. And these are her own words.) “It's ob-
noxious...not so much the ringIets...as the frizzy
ends. I've tried all kinds of things to get the curl
out but nothing does it. I have to set it in great big
roIIers...and just keep my fingers cross_ed.Whenever
_it’s even a little damp outside...the set comes right
out. My hair just hangs sort of bushy.
I "I've always envied kids who've had straight hair.
I'd really love to-wear those straight, collegiate styles.
Do you really think CURL FREE can "do that for me?”

 

.“My bangs!The sides!  really
took. the curl out.” I

“The bangs—that’s the part I'm crazy about. And its
springy.You know...not limp or anything.I love it! It
was simple, too.MainIy,I just applied CURL FREE and
combed it through. Now I won't have to set it as
much. It won't frizz up—fantastic!”-DEE DEE DOLAN.

Comb those natural curls right out ofyourhairwith
cool, creamy CURL FREE. Even ifyour hair is so curly it
puts up a real fight—it will surrender to CURL FREE.
Just keep using it and you’ll 
see. Styling Freedom that lasts 

for months.That’s CURL FREE.
