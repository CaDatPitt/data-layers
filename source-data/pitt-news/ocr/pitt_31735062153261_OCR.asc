“W. S. G. A.” hMock Comedy
to be Presented by Mem-
bers in Hospitality ,House
Cafeteria ‘

“W. S. G. A.,” a mock‘ comedy, will

the Hospitality Home Cafeteria at 8
o'clock Wednesday, April ‘13. The
scene is laid in Greece, before its
downfall and the costumes are in the
classical style.

The plot is a combination of mod-
ern ideas and ancient -customs. A
number of Greek women “borrow”
their husband’si clothes-and disguise
themselves as men. In this deceptive
makeup they go to the legislature and
pass a bill which turns the govern-
ment over to the women. .

The ﬁrst duty of the women is to
bring the tragic poet Euripides to
trial on a charge of slandering the
women in his writings. Realizing the
fact that a mere man could have no
inﬂuence before a. court of suifragettes,
the father-in-law of Euripides dis-
guises himself as a woman and goes
to the trial to plead the case of his
son-in-law. His identity is discovered,
and the ‘court is enraged.

Classical Club -officers are: Presi-
dent, Gertrude Coffman; vice presi-
dent, Betty Hubacker; secretary-treas
urer, Helen ‘Bartholomew,

Prof. Neal Caldwell of the Carnegie
Technology School of Drama, assisted
by Prof. Evan T. Sage and Harold
Gilmer of the. Department of Latin,
are directing the play.

Musical Numbers by Ben-

ialties Prove to be Hits of‘

.5

Show

9: . .— ‘ v

A well-enjoyed farce with the or-’
dinary musical comedy plot and with
breezy music was what “Done and
Undone,” this year’s production of the
Cap and Gown -Club, proved to be.
The four performances of the show in
the ‘Schenley Theater were attended
by large audiences.

In a review of the play for the
Pittsburgh Dispatch, May Stranathan
commented on the plot as follows:
“The comedy tells a tale, which as
the author of books and lyrics, John
M- Walker, says in his character of
the breezy hotel clerk, has ‘All Been
Done Before’——a tale of parents who
arrange a marriage for their chil-
dren and children who rebel and run
away without waiting to see or even
learn the names of those chosen for
them, only to ﬁnd they are the ‘very
persons with whom they fall in
love._ But there are really only a few
plots in all literature and this one
seems to stay everlastingly fresh and
the denouement was greeted with the
same old delightful surpris’e.and every
one seemed satisﬁed.”

The musical numbers by Benjamin
Levant, '21, added “pep” and zest to
the production and received generous
applause. “Audrey” and “Maid of My
Dreams" proved to be the most ‘en-
joyed of the numerous musical num-
bers in the play. Other numbers were
“Give Us a Lot of Applause," “But—-
That’s All Been Done Before,” “Sweet
Fanciful Queen,” “Those Telephon’
Blues,” “Love Has a Way All of Its
Own,” “Vamping Eyes” and “Our Lit-
tle ._ Bungalow.”

The specialties proved to be among
the hits of the performance. John
Ankeny and F.  “Pie” Williams in
their fantastic classical dance pre-
sented the most humorous scenes of
the show. The Pitt Varsity Quartet,
consisting of Yardum, Donnelly,’Kleb-
er and Drew, was given generous ap-
plause. The songs by J.‘ D. Duve,
Regis Toomey and Philip Small were
well received. _

The show brought forth, a. well-
trained chorus, which showed the
coaching of Mrs. Gus A. Schnabel.

' The co-authors of the play, John M.
VValker and Louis M, Fushan, both
played their parts well, the former as
Sammy Allen, a hotel clerk, and the
latter’ as Patricia St. Clair. J. F.
Regis"’I‘oomey, veteran of other Cap
and Gown shows,. played the part of
Audrey Muldoon, the heroine, an-d
proved a charming “maiden.” The
hero, William Knight, was acted by
Aubrey Schoﬁeld. Harvey J. Harmon
had a chance to show his football
strength inthe part of Terrance Mul-
doon. 7 Max A. Loevner was Gloria Ap-
pleton, -the Twentieth Century vamp
‘of the show, and Ralph O. P. Silver-
man was 0. I. Hookum, the corre-
spondence school detective, who “un
did” everything. ~ ‘
