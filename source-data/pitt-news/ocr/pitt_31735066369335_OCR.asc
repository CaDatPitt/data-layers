Alternative Curriculum  

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Alternative Curriculum pro-
gram, a bone of contention at Pitt
recently, was voted down by the
College of Arts. and‘ Sciences
council last week. . '

Council member and student
Joseph McGroarty said last night
he received 5' letter from CAS
council president Dean Irwin
Schulman Saturday stating the
5-4-1_ vote cast in favor of the
program last’ Wednesday had been
changed to a negative vote.

"McGroarty said the letter indi-
cated the vote was changed to 6 to 5
against the program after an

, abstaining -vote cast by an as-yet

unidentiﬁed council member was
recast after the meeting. ‘ '
The change of vote made ‘-the
tally 5-5, McGroarty said, with
Schulman as president casting a
“nay” ballot to decide the tie.

“I had no information onvthis
(vote change) after the meeting,”
McGroarty said, “I was completely
surprised when I received this
letter because I had considered the
meeting adjourned.”

Key to the recent vote negating
the Alternative Curriculum pro-
gram was a proxy vote cast ‘by
council member Jan J aworski. .

J aworski left the meeting before-

its conclusion, McGroarty said,

Times Continues Publication Under Previous Policy

By SUE McFARLAND ..
Pitt News Staff Writer

The University Times will
publish uninterrupted on its
biweekly schedule despite rumors
that the paper would soon cease
publication.

“The Times will publish as usual
and will continue to do so in the
forseeable future,” Mary Ann
Aug, director of Pitt’s Office of
News and Publications said last
night. “Some steps will be taken in
the future however to help the
paper meet the communicational
needs of the community.”

Aug added that she has been

Student Uon Should ‘Be

instructed by the. university to
investigate the possibility of giving
the paper a new look, keeping in
mind the belief in a “high quality,
objective newspaper.”

At Friday’s Faculty Assembly
meeting, Gerald Massey, professor
of philosophy introduced a resolu-

tion to offer continued support to ~

the paper in light of an alleged
“secret resolution" by the admin-
istration to discontinue publication
of The University Times, replacing
it with an “in-house publication.”

According to David‘ Engle,
president of the University Senate
Council, the council officers who

SGB president Josh Baylson, whose term expires Wednesday, urged the
university to carry out a proposed 81 3.5 million Student Union renovation.

were informed of the proposal over
a week ago, were told that the
resolution was in the workings
because of “low readership and
ﬁscal restraint.” , ‘

Aug said according to the most
recent survey taken in 1976, over
80 percent of those polled read The
University Times.

Engle argued at the meeting
against the second charge of fiscal
restraint, saying that the costs of
producing an in-house newspaper
would be very similar to the current
costs of producing The University
Times. -

Pitt News Staff Writer

In his ﬁnal days as Student
Government Board president, Josh
Baylson is still urging administra-
tors to move ahead on the Schenley
Hall renovation project. g

“I made my ﬁnal push at the

Student Affairs Advisory Commit-.

tee meeting last week,” said
Baylson. , “I feel that the new board
is behind me on the renovation
project.” ' — ,

Baylson said that there are
basically three renovations propos-
als. They include: -

—-A $1 million facelift, which

. would involve painting the Student

Union.
—--A $6.5 million proposal which

would involve painting, purchase of ‘

new furniture, and building of new
walls. Baylson said, “This would

leave the Student Union pretty ‘

much. the same structurally, but in
a nicer fashion.”
.-——A $13 million proposal which

would include gutting the entire .i

Student Union and completely
redesigning the building.
The third proposal is the one that

According to a policy statement
issued by The University Times,
the newspaper has several basic
objectives: to cover events at or
concerning the university, to
provide a forum for full discussion
of all major issues, to enunciate
positions taken by the university
administration, to report off-
campus news that has potential

. .bearing on the university commun-

ity, to provide a forum for faculty,
staff and administration opinions,
to make a statement—-by virtue of

its existence—-about the fairness“

and reliability of the university
administration. These objectives

the present SGB endorses.

“There are a lot of advantages to
redesigning the building,” said
Baylson. “Presently, there is an
enormous waste of space in the
Student Union in ‘hallways and
restrooms. This plan would change
the building from a hotel into a rea
student union.” '

Of all the proposed additions to
the new Student Union, Baylson
cited a quiet study area accessible
from the outside as the most
important.

“If this area is accessible from
the outside, it could remain open 24
hours,” he said. “I'd also like to

see a lounge adjacent to this study .

area with couches. People could
actually sleep there if they are
stranded by the weather or stay
overnight before an early midterm

or final.”

According to Baylson, students
surveyed this fall preferred a quiet
study area to any other renovation.

Also high on the students’, list of’

priorities are a bar separating the
recreation room from the eating
area, a newstand, a snack bar, a

Norman reiterated on one part of 

"the policy statement that says, “it
is‘ essential that The University

as the nation‘s most respected

basement. s .
“While students can walk down
the street to get many of these
things, like stamps or newspapers,
that's not the idea behind these
changes,” said Baylson. “The
idea is that the student has enough
hassles during the day and a
student union is there for the
convenience of the students.”

A decision has yet to be made .

about funding of the renovations.
According to Baylson, there are
three possible modes of funding.
The fee will be paid by either the
state ‘General Services Administra-
tion, donations to the university’s

capital campaign fund or at Student _

Union fee.paid by the students.
“As far as I know‘, the university
has decided not to apply for the

tion money,” he said. “The
university plans to contribute
something, but there will almost.
certainly be a fee for students.”

A spokesman for the Iranian
Islamic movement led by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
recently said he wanted Ri-
chard Cottam, a Pitt political
science professor, to be the
American ambassador to Iran.
I According to Cottam, ‘those
were personal remarks made
by the spokesman, Shariar
Rohani, while being inter-
viewed by syndicated column-
ist Mary McGrory.
Cottam said Rohani was not

representing Khomeini and

Pitt Professor Says He

added that the Ayatollah did
not mention the position when
I he spoke with Cottam in
December. Cottam stated he
did not. expect such an
appointment, saying he is
satisﬁed to stay at Pitt.
“Rohani said the United
States should. appoint an
ambassador that understands
the Khomeini movement, -Cot-
tam said. “There are a lot of
foreign service officers who
understand Iran.”
Rohani, who is not a
diplomat but -speaks for the
movement in the United States,

Does Not Expect Ambassador Post

is connected by family to the
leading religious circles in Iran.
Although the United States -
strongly supported the Shah,
Cottam said good relations with
Iran are still possible if the
current government stabilizes
and if the United States makes
no drastic diplomatic errors.
That includes economic ties
such as exporting oil and
business with multinational
corporations.

“They (the Iranians) under-
stand their desperate need for
foreign exchange,” Cottam

said. Oil exports are scheduled
to start next week. , ‘* *

“Contracts with the multina-
tionals will be based on Iran's
self interest,” said Cottam,
“Most of those contracts will
be renewed.”

He said Marxist opposition
to Khomeini is extremely
fragmented and is not an
immediate threat to the go-
vernment. .

However, Cottam said that
polarization between the reli-
gious and secular forces
within the Khomeini movement
could weaken it.

— pertains to internal develop-

‘ and the West.

The Soviet Union’s relations
with Iran will be worse now
than they were with the Shah,
according to Cottam. Kho-
meini is anti-communist and
anti-Spoviet because of the
Soviet Union’s poor treatment
of its Moslem minority.

Cottam explained that the
idea of an Islamic republic

ment and laws governing the
Iranian people, and should not
adversely affect the chances of
good relations between Iran

after indicating to Schulman she
would vote against the program.

McGroarty stated there was
discussion over whether J aworski’s
vote should be included in the ﬁnal
tally, with the final decision being
that her vote had no consequence
on any ultimate resolution since the
general vote had already swayed
toward supporting the program.

However, the vote was counted

night that proceedings after last

Hesidence stated that, according
to the manual, absentee votes must
be __in the hands of the presiding
officer before each meeting is
adjourned. Additionally, Hesi-
dence said, Schulman’s vote may
be illegal. .

“You can’t vote outside a public

’ meeting,” Hesidence stated. “He
(Schulman) could not vote unless
there was another meeting called.’-’

However, Hesidence added that
the recent vote probably has no
effect on the ultimate fate of the
program. -

“It’s been my experience at Pitt
that councils only advise in that
they agree with the administra-
tion,” he stated.

' The Alternative Curriculum pro-
gram has been under scrutiny by
the administration for some time.
Those opposing the program have
stated that enrollment has exceed-
ed costs and that its structure is
loosely supervised.

Supporters of the groups have
contended that it is conducive to
developing intellectual skills and
maintains high quality education.

Council president Irwin Sculman cast a deciding vote last week that withdrew
support from Pitt's Alternative Curriculum program.

Flame throwing, ﬁre dancing,
and weapon ﬁghting will highlight

“Movement: An Extravaganza of ,
the Arts,” a martial arts show, to ,

beheld in the Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall this Tuesday at 7
p.m.

“The Extravaganza of the Arts
moves the martial arts from the
gym ﬂoor to the stage, combining
the various styles through music,
ﬁghting, ‘dance, and exercise,”
said Curtis Smith, the show’s
coordinator and a self-defense
instructor in the area.

,.“The show is unique to the
Pittsburgh area,” Smith continued.
“Never before has Pittsburgh
experienced a show that combines
the best of music, dance, and the
martial arts. The show not only
entertains, but educates.”

Both local and international
talent will appear. Featured will be
performers from Samoa, Japan,
Africa, and Hong Kong, including

Samoan ﬁre dancer Malingi Tele- .

fano.

“Since many individuals know
little about the martial arts except
what they saw in Bruce Lee movies,
a narratorwill explain ‘the history,
the purpose, and the essence of the
arts,” said Smith, who will also
perform. ,

“All the acts will be performed
under the spotlight and the
participants, ages eight to 45, will
wear native costumes and use
authentic weapons.”

According to Smith,
features include a - ﬁre dance
performed by Malingi; an African
art sequence featuring native
dancers, drummers, and warriors;
Brazilian, ﬁghting and dancing;
West Indies stick ﬁghting; a
Japanese assassin sequence; and
Chinese animal forms.

The show, sponsored by the Pitt
Union Program Council’s recrea-
tion division, is free to Pitt students
with admission for the general
public set at $2.00 per person.

she said. \“I decided to enter the
contest for the experience, for the

I got the phone call I just couldn’t

Feminists in the past have said
that the pageant exploited women,
but Ferguson, a secretary for Pitt’s

greed.

“I don’t feel that I’m being

the pageant as an aid to a career in
fields such as modeling ‘ and a
means of recognition,” Ferguson
said.

Panel Of Reporters Discusses Role of NewsRepor’ring

By PHILIP CONTES
Pitt News Staff Writer

The role of news reporting was
debated by a panel of journalists
recently in the speech class,
Presidential Rhetoric.

Robert W. Dickey, general
manager of KQV and WDVE radio,

Robert Yuna, assignments editor of
KDKA news and Lynn Hinds,
anchorman and reporter for
WTAE-TV, were members of the
panel. _

Each speaker defined their
concept of news.

is news,” Hinds said. Yuna added,
“News is about change and
conflict.” .

“Although reporters and net-
works may have pet subjects,
which are heavily covered, this is

not necessarily evidence of bias,’,".

Dickey said in answer to a comment

“Anything in the public interest

   

about bias in the news. .
Hinds commented, “The news

To Vote Or
Not to Vote

In a meeting held last Wednesday night, it was
determined by the College of Arts and Sciences
Council to retain the Alternative Curriculum
program by a vote of 5 to 4 with one abstention. This
past Saturday, however, members of the council were
informed by Dean Irwin Schulman that the vote had
been changed to 6 to 4 against the continuation of the
program.

The story thatThe Pitt News received was that the
person who cast the abstention vote and is not yet
known, conferred with Dean Schulman informing
him that he had intended to vote against the con-
tinuation of the Alternative Curriculum program.

Schulman accepted the vote change as valid, and, -

since the new vote count created a 5-5 tie, Schulman
excercised his right to vote in order to break the tie.
I-Iis “nay” vote created the 6 to 4 ending of the
program.

The Alternative Curriculum program, for those
who are not familiar with it, offers a student the op-
portunity to gain college credit for taking classes that
are not usually considered as part of a normal college
curriculum;

matically is added to the total of the side that garners
the most votes. This should have made the vote 6 to
4 in favor of retaining the program." Once the vote

had been counted, the vote should have been
declared official and the issue settled. The change in
vote should never have been allowed, not only for the
reason mentioned above, but for the moral implica-
tions involved with the situation that occurred after-
ward.

As it stands, we call for the re-intervention of the
council, along with a re-vote, or that the original 5-4-
1 vote (which should be considered to be 6 to 4) be
allowed to stand. There is no excuse for this crucial
issue to -be handled in such a shoddy manner,
especially when the academic fate of the students is
concerned. Immediate action should be taken.

The fate of the Alternative Curriculum program
and the way that it was dealt its death blow is yet
another example of the lack of communication and
the ultimate power of the administration over the stu-

dents at Pitt.

By VINCE ORNATO, JR.

I was trudging through the snow
and wind down Fifth Avenue the
other day when I came upon a
frowning old man standing in front
of the Campus Book Store. He
looked about 70 years old, and he
had a red face and sagging jaws.
His expression said he was

‘_miserable about something so I

thought I'd give him a hearty

‘greeting to cheer his soul.

“What do you think about the
Steelers?” I exclaimed with en-

g thusiasm.

“STEELERS!!” he screeched.
‘ ‘ Steelers! Those radicals!”

Taken back a bit I
“Radicals?”

“What would you call a band of
rabble-rousers like that?” His face
grew even redder.

asked,

“What do you mean by
rabble-rousers?” I asked. I was
confounded.

The old man stepped closer to
me, peered over his right shoulder,
and then whispered from the side
of his mouth, “Do you mean, you
don’t know?"

‘The issue at hand, however, is not the merit of the
program as it stands. This is something that can be '
dealt with at a later date. The issue that we question
is the way that the program was ended.

i According to Robert’s Rules of Order (which is the
accepted mode of conducting most voting council af-
fairs), when a vote is cast asan abstention, it auto— *

I shook my head. I noticed he
had a chew‘ of tobacco in his jaw.

“Those—those Steelers. I think
they’re takin’ over. The main
group of ‘em seems small,” he said
and spit out some tobacco juice.
“But, they got a lot of power
somehow and a lot of silent outside
members. It's just like the Ku
Klux Klan.”

“The Steelers are powerful, all
right," I said. “But they’re——”

“They’re trouble makers. I just
know it," he interrupted. “Now I
don't know i what their exact
intentions are, but their instigatin'
too much hoopla and rowdiness
around town.” He spit out more

_ juice.

“Mister, what makes you think
the Steelers are trouble makers?"

“Young fellow, ya just haven’t
been around much, have ya?”
- I straightened up. trying to look
like I had been around much.

“These Steelers have been
appearin' on television, on radio, in
the newspapers. They’re every-
where.” As he spoke, he glanced
over his shoulder from time to
time. “Seems they got a plan, boy,

a big plan,” he whispered. “I'm
not sure what it is, though.”

Always one to respect my elders,
I let him continue. In his case.
senility carried with it an interest-
ing viewpoint. I agreed with him,
“They have been everywhere. But
how can you be sure they're
causing trouble?"

“It's because of how they avoid
tellin‘ exactly what they want. We
don't know their intentions. We
got to be careful. They got the local
newscasters backin’ them up.
They got national news backin’
them. They have banners
downtown.

“Records singin’ about ’em on
radio. Every mornin7 for the past
month I put on my radio and the
fella is talkin’ bout Steelers. ‘I
switch stations. The guy’s talkin’
bout Steelers. I switch to a few
more stations and more Steelers.
Finallyl turn off the damn radio,
put on the TV and guess what?” .

“More Steelers?”

“More Steelers,” he said as he
spit out some tobacco juice and
wiped his mouth with a wrinkled
red paw. ‘

“I see,” I said. “You're afraid
because you don’t know what

do?”

He put his hand on my shoulder.

not to fret none. One thing about
‘em. they don’t seem too bright
upstairs."

“Why do you say that?"

“Well. for some reason they
want to beat up on cowboys. I’m
not sure why but it’s true. The real
stupid part is they went to Miami to
find ‘em. Anyone knows cowboys
ain't in Miami."

I acted relieved. “Not too smart,
huh?” I said. “Do they have a
leader?" .

“Well, they got this fella called
Bradshaw whose their top guy in
the field. I think he works with
bombs," he glanced over his
shoulder. “But, between you and 1,
boy, I think the mastermind is a
guy they call Noll.”

“Why do they hate cowboys,” I
choked, holding in my laugh.

“Could _be just the start, boy.
First, cowboys, then, who knows?
If they’ll beat up cowboys they’ll
stop at nothing. But fact is fact. I
heard it on the radio yesterday!
The Steelers went to Miami and
beat the cowboys! I’m as surprised
as you. How did they know
cowboys would be there? They
must have ambushed a touring
rodeo or something. -

“And it was a ﬁerce battle as
near as I can tell. The Steelers got
35 of theirs and the cowboys got 31

“At least the cowboys gave them
a tough fight,” I said.

“They musta. But, like I say, I
know the Steelers got thousands of
members because no sooner did I
hear they beat those cowboys then I
hear horns blowing, and people
yelling and banging pots! It's a big

The question of the W proper
relationship between the two
primary responsibilities of our
university-—teaching and resear-
ch—is a crucial one. Recent
correspondance in The Pitt News
and elsewhere has tended to
exaggerate the tension that may
arise between the commitment of
the faculty to the advancement of
knowledge through research and to
its transmission through teaching.

I am concerned that many of our
students, and apparently some of
our faculty, have lost sight of the
unique and priceless opportunity

that a university can offer and that '

can make it an entirely different
type of institution from a high
school, a liberal arts college or a
research institute, each of which
certainly has its place.

Many departments on this
campus have faculties whose
members are, by and large, deeply
interested in their fields of
scholarship and are ready, willing
and able to share that interest with
students who take education
seriously. Teachers who are
involved directly in creative schol-
arship are obviously in a better
position to communicate the
adventures of intellectual discovery
from first-hand daily experience
than are those who know about
their subject but are not involved
directly in its development.

The reporting of new knowledge

to one’s peers for criticism through
publication or lectures is a
demanding and sometimes humbl-
ing requirement to which a
university faculty is traditionally
held accountable. I can testify from
my own teaching experience. that
there is a world of difference
between the comfortable climate of
uncritical pedagogical authority
that develops in most liberal arts
colleges and the demands for
continued contributions to creative
learning that are expected in a
university.

Onefs knowledge of a lively ﬁeld
becomes rapidly outdated if'it is
based entirely on second-hand
knowledge from undergraduate
text books. i

A good university can attract
highly qualiﬁed graduate students
for participation both as fellow
researchers and as superior teach-
ing assistants. The research
support funds that such a faculty
brings to the campus can help to
provide facilities, personnel and
programs that enormously increase
the learning opportunities for
students at all levels and that
would otherwise have to ‘be covered
by tuition.

The prestige that such a
department may enjoy in the highly
competitive world of higher educa-
tion is only maintained by
continued strenuous efforts by its
faculy and students. Graduates are

 
   
      

Cd 661-I311

     

tr 4:2

U

«evid-

apt to find that such prestige is
roughly convertible into the market
value of the degrees, which they
get from that department.

In all of these ways and many
more, the undergraduate program
can benefit from high quality
research on campus. The fact that
it doesn’t always work out this way
is due more to our individual
failings as teachers and students
than to the system.

Pitt has departments and'faculty
members who do embody the best

‘ traditions and concerns of teaching

with highly creative ability in
research. Students who wish to
take full advantage of such
departments can get an outstand-
ing education here. They do not
need to go to an expensive Ivy
League college. '

Sadly enough, Pitt also has
departments and faculty members
who fall far short of reasonable
expectations both as teachers or as

creative scholars. Insofar as they
project a cynical or contemptuous
attitude either toward undergrad-
uate teaching or toward the
advancement of knowledge, they
debase and weaken our total
collective effort as learners toge-
ther.

There is no necessary correlation
that I know of (either positive or
negative) between teaching ability
and research. Some outstanding
researchers are also vitally con-
cerned and interesting teachers.
Some faculty who are inactive in
research are also dull teachers and,
of course, some do only one thing
well.

All of us, students, faculty and
administrators, stand to benefit by
improvement of the total quality of
education at Pitt—both as we
experience it and as it is recognized
from the outside. This will be
fostered best by recruiting and
giving tenure to faculty who have a

strong lifetime commitment to
teaching and to creative scholar-
ship.

The faculty bears the main
responsibility for evaluating .,re-
search potential and performance.
I agree with my colleague, Robert
Wolke, that students can help to
evaluate teaching by the fair
reporting of superior or clearly poor
teaching to chairmen and deans.

The opportunity to teach and to
share in the discovery of knowledge
in a university like Pitt is a‘ rare
privilege, which carries special
responsibilities. Every effort
should be made to recruit new

' faculty members who are ready to

do “the whole job” and to
encourage our students to take full
advantage of the opportunities that
are available to them at this
university.

Closing ‘The University Times’ -
Pressure From A dministrators?

It has come to my attention from
numerous sources who wish to
remain anonymous that The
University Times is receiving
pressure from the university
administration to reduce its editor-
ial autonomy. This unofficial policy
statement seems to indicate that
the university wants no negative
press coverage dealing with the
recent controversy at Pitt, which

began with Jerry Miller's letter on
Jan. 31. '

Is the objective of this policy to
covert The University Times into an
uncritical supporter of university
policy? The freedom to criticize
oneself is the test of the free
exchange of ideas. Is this free
exchange not a fundamental reason
behind Pitt's existence?

In limiting the editorial latitute of

The University Times, the admini-
stration is revealing an insensitivity
to the difference between construc-
tive self-criticism and self-congrat-
ulatory public relations. How can
the administration ignore the fact
that public controversy is the key to
resolving problems? I urge the
administration to reconsider its
action.

A Tonic for the Troops
The Boomtown Rate
Columbia

For the past three years ‘a great
deal of critical attention has been
showered upon the New Wave.
Except for Elvis Costello, this
attention hasn’t translated itself to

~popular‘appeal. This is probably

because most American listeners
could care less about the political
protest stands of the English

. -bands.

L This has left agap, filled by
groups and people such as Blondie,
Nick Lowe, and Dave ’Edmunds,
who also could care less about
protest and who want to make good
time rock. The Boomtown Rats ﬁt
(into this growing category.

The Boomtown Rats’ second
album, “A Tonic for the Troops,”
has finally been released in the
United States after great success in
Britain. Some English critics
already have hailed them as the
new Rolling Stones! However,
pretentious afﬁliations with bands

or movements do not distinguish

B the Boomtown Rats, but the band’s

performance does.

In some ways: the Boomtown
Rats are unusual because they are
more inﬂuenced by the Rolling
Stones then by The Who. Most of
the original English New Wave
bands took their style and stance
from pre-“Tommy” Who,

album is pure “power-pop," with
bright melodies, smart lyrics and

' builds until

with these normally insubstantial
elements is a cheerfully mordant
sense of humor and a strong,-
though understated, social con-
cern.

In the Biritsh number one single
“Rat Trap,” all these elements
mesh together perfectly. The song
opens with a mid-tempo piano and
a saxophone cuts
through the melody, ala Bruce’
Springsteen and the E Street Band.

While Springsteen would deliver
a romantic lyric about life in the

better and comment: “There s

screaming and crying in the high

rise blocks it’s a rat trap Billy and '

you’re already caught.”

How well these sentiments will
go over in this country is
impossible to say but the Boom-
town Rats have the musical
expertise to express them. With
some luck and substantial support
from its label, one might soon

wonder why there was any doubt ’

about the band’s success.

Days of Heaven -
Directed by Terence Mallick

It opens with a montage of photographs. of immigrants
and-laborers in turn—of-the-century American cities, but
“Days of Heaven” dwells brieﬂy on the grimy confines of
the steelmill where the ﬁlm itself begins. This is a tale of

' Brooke Adams stars In “Days of Heaven”...

ENr£RTAiNMENT

‘Days of Heaven ’ -- Passion onthe Panhandle

passion which‘ could happen any place, but here erupts on a
farm on the Texas panhandle. ’

Bill (Richard Gere) kills a man during a ﬁght in the
Chicago steelmill where he works. He runs from the scene
and with his younger sister (Linda Manz) and his girlfriend
Abby (Brooke Adams), joins a group of migratory workers.

Passing off Abby as a sister to keep talk down, they ride the -

rails to Texas where they are offered 53 per week to work
the harvest for a wealthy young farmer (Sam Shepard).
Bill overheats a conversation between the farmer and his
doctor and learns that his employer has approximately
a year to live. When the farmer begins to express» an
interest in Abby, Bill encourages her to respond.

“He’s got one foot on a roller skate and the other on a

banana peel,” he explains. . »
The farmer marries Abby, Bill andhis sister move with

‘them into the huge farmhouse. Bill _and Abby manage -to

steal an occasional kiss, an evening together in the lake.
Her husband, at ﬁrst, does not suspect and the four spend
days and evenings playing. ,

“The rich have it all figured out. We just sat around all
day and cracked jokes,” observes the sister in her crackled
narration. , , .

_ But Bill and Abby grow careless and the husband
catches them in an embrace. She tells him it is just the way

brothers and sisters act, but there is tension in the air and

Bill leaves. During his absence, Abby falls in love with the
farmer. -

When the migratory workers return, so does Bill. Abby
explains that her feelings for him have changed and he
accepts it, but the farmer still hurts from a jealousy he
struggles to suppress. .

Then, suddenly, everything erupts. A plague of locusts

descends on the wheatﬁelds. The workers light a bonﬁre to E

burn damaged crops. The farmer’s hatred of Bill comes to
a head and he lunges at him with his torch. The ﬁre
catches the ﬁelds ablaze. , . .. '

  Falk Plays ‘Columbo’ in ‘The Brinks Job’

By J OE BRANDT

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Brinks Job

. Directed by William ‘Friedkin

Can a small time petty thief ﬁnd
wealth and happiness by attempt-
ing the crime of the century? He
can but the audience probably
won’t in “The Brinks Job,”
William Friedkin’s new‘ film
starring Peter Falk.

. Falk portrays Tony Peno, a

small-time burglar in Boston
during World’ War II who, with the
help of his bungling brother-in-law
Vinnie Costa (Allen Goorwitz),
manages to botch up a series of
minor break—ins. Then, just when

'it seems that they had failed as

criminals, Tony and Vinnie stumble
upon the headquarters of Brinks,‘
lnc., with its magical bags of
money. ‘

After making a few small-time
hits on individual trucks, Tony calls

together his troops, including a
bookie, a bartender, and even an
ex-army demolitions expert, to help
pullioff the world's biggest heist.

Although not your usual laugh it
up type comedy, “The Brinks Job”
has a few 7 humorous moments
provided by the accident-prone
Vinnie, and the McCarthy-era FBI.

‘ The ﬁlm’s.satire on the law helps,

but unfortunately, the laughs are
too few and far between to make

“ but to think of “Columbo,”

this a really good comedy. And this
ﬁlm is not serious enough to be
taken otherwise. L t

Looking at Falk, one can’t help
not
only because of his face, but
because, somehow, even the cigar
and mangy raincoat are dragged
into the ﬁlm. It seems as though
Falk will remain as the dirty
detective for sometime to come.

But even without an abundance
of humorous scenes, the audience

leaves feeling better than when it
came in. The old American
tradition to cheer for the underdog
comes forth as Tony and his crew
come out, not exactly smelling like
roses, but at least standing tall
among the small.

If it’s hysterical comedy you’re
looking for, you won’t exactly ﬁnd
it here. But “The Brinks Job” will
at least give you a little boost that
makes your day seem a little easier.

ii‘Roots: Second Generation’ Equals Original

By GARY BRADFORD

Pitt News Staff Writer

Roots: The Next Generations
ABC-TV ,_

~ Trying to compare “Roots: The
Next Generations” to the first
‘‘ Roots’ ’ is like comparing a ruby to
an emerald. The differences in
beauty and value are purely
subjective and so are the dif-

ferences in the two "Roots."

Both shows had outstanding

productions, superb performances —

and individual scenes of intense
emotion, like Kunta Kinte’s cap-
ture by slavers in the first show and

Haley’s return to Kinte’s village in

the second.

\. « -- more reason,
Still, “Roots II” seemed to

depict events more incisively.
Maybe this was because of. the

behind-the-scenes black input by
directors Georg Stanford Brown
and Lloyd Richards, and writer
Sydney P. Glass or maybe it was
because«the story covered a period_
close to our own. Whatever the
‘ “Roots Il” struck
deeper into.._the black experience

 

than anything yet seen on
commercial television.‘ ’
The second segment explored

the formation and development of
the black middle class, both its
strengths and shortcomings. After
a steady diet of criminal types and
updated minstrel shows, the Haley

family’s human struggles were an-
',,oasis inthe n'é'two"rk wasteland. 

 

Alongside the romance and
mythological aspects, there were
the usually neglected truths at?
American history: the‘ disenfran-

chisement- of Southern blacks after
Reconstruction, the armed forces‘

racism, and the completely oppQ- 

site philosophies of Booker T_

Washington and W.E.B. DuBois. ..-

Fine Cinematography in ‘Days of Heaven’

(Continued from page 8)

Adams are almost embarassingly intimate in the way he
shyly opens up to her. From the painstaking way he breaks
through his natural reserve to longingly watch her through
his telescope to his furious hurt when he observes her
kissing Gere in the shadows of the gazebo where all four
played through the summer, Shepard gives a ﬁne
performance.

Shepard, a successful playwright who has a show
currently running on Broadway and who wrote “Angel
City," recently produced by Theatre Express here, made
his acting debut in the film.

Gere is smoldering in his sensuality. His Bill, at ﬁrst.
seems interested only in sex and proﬁt. but when he
painfully watches Adams and Shepard drive off on their
wedding trip or gazes up at the warm glow from their lit
windows, Gere shows his vulnerability and is at his best.

Adams, the object of the passion. is rather opaque——-
pretty to look at but never giving off much emotion at all
except for a quick laugh here. and a quietly loving look at
Shepard there.

Manz provides the narration throughout. a technique
director Terence Mallick used in his previous hit ﬁlm,
“Badlands." Her voice sounds grating and tough, an
octave higher than John Travolta's in “Saturday Night
Fever." Manz plays a hardened street kid. a bit
reminiscent of Tatum O'Neal in “Paper Moon" but without

the veneer of innocence. Manz plays a survivor who can
make it on her own and ultimately has to.

Mallick uses other techniques from “Badlands.” “Days
of Heaven" is set in roughly the same area and there are
similar sweeping shots of the countryside.

Mallick uses ﬁlm as a metaphor: the animal images in
“Days of Heaven" are particularly vivid and appropriate.
He uses light and contrast almost so subtly that
suggestions and foreshadowing are incorporated into the
richness of the ﬁlm

The cinematography in “Days of Heaven" is exquisite.
Malick captures the sensuous line of golden wheatﬁelds
swaying in the Texas wind, the erotic ripples of the water.
Shepard's farm is shown as a place of ultimate bounty.
where buffalo roam and the deer and antelope play—1n
actuality. There are the blazing furnaces of the steelmills
and the bonﬁres of the migrant’s camp and. ﬁnally, the
horrible ﬂames that devour the lush wheatﬁelds.

Mallick’s eye for detail is amazing. He catches such
seemingly minor details that add to the over-all tapestry of

Immigrant workers babbling in foriegn languages and
dialects, a wheat plant sprouting from seed, small animals
darting from the path of the threshing machines -- all such
tiny pieces, so easy to overlook. give texture to the ﬁlm.

The time is worked into the storyline beautifully.
President Wilson's train passes by Shephard’s farm on a
whistle-stop tour, a travelling circus lands Fokker biplanes
in the wheatﬁelds, and a marching band sends doughboys
off to World War I.

The musical score is haunting and couples with the
camera for both improbable beauty and wrenching horror.
There is the apprehensive rustle of piano keys as the ﬁlm
opens in the mills. the swelling organ chords of a mass
celebrated in the ﬁelds to open the harvest, and the
mournful violins foreshadowing tragedy: all create a
heightened awareness as events unfold.

“Days of Heaven" is rich with imagery, engrossing to
view. It is like taking an old postcard from an album and
watching it come to life.

Generations” com lemented and . .
P sor, “Roots lI” scrutinized more

Many of the characters in the
second show were more three-di-
mensional than in the previous
show. Al Freeman Jr. gave a ﬁery

portrayal of Malcolm X, in what
might have been TV’s first honest
presentation of black “militancy.”
Malcolm was seen as he was in
reality, an intellectual.

The exception to the full blown
characters was the teenage Alex
Haley, played by Damon Fjvans.

Evans seemed as if he were still

a result, he was overwhelmed by
nearly everyone with which he
shared scenes.

Like the two “Godfathersfn enhanced each other. But, just as
The Next “Godfather II’’ probed deeper into

“Roots” and “Roots:

fully the Afro-American psyche.

Brando Contribution Valuable

“Roots: The Next Generation” marked the
television debut of Marlon Brando and the two-time
Oscar winner did not disappoint in his much
publicized role of George Lincoln Rockwell, head of
the American Nazi movement.

Brando’s part was relatively small: his scene takes
place when Alex Haley (James Earl Jones) interviews
Rockwell for Playboy magazine.

During the interview, which Haley conducts with
admirable dignity, Rockwell extolls the superiority of
the white race. He sprays an aerosal air freshener
around the room, wields a pistol and, at Haley’s

request, sings a couple little racist ditties.
Brando’s pertormance is brilliant, in part because
it is such a change of pace for Brando, who has, in the
past, insisted on playing sympathetic characters. His
Rockwell is a fool and Brando plays him as such, but
not blatantly. Subtlety is the kev to his performance.

‘ Brando’s low mumble of a voice works extremely
well——a ﬁne contrast to the usually strident tones
used by most film heavies. His Rockwell
acknowledges Haley’s intelligence, then spouts forth
some racist drivel about the rest of his race. There's
a human element in Rockwellthat Brando, captures
and expresses so deftly.

  Pitt wins Toumamenth opener, 5-so

    Cagers Dunk Colonials

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor
Pitt center Sam Clancy wore a
pale blue T-shirt last night with a
cartoon and the words “I Don't get
Mad—I get Even,” printed across
the back.

Sam did not and the Panthers
did, beating George Washington
University, 85-80, in a first round

Eastern Eight basketball touma-V

ment game.

The victory, was particularly
sweet for Pitt, which had been
physically knocked around in

January when the Panthers (17-10)
lost a wild game against the
Colonials in Washington, D.C.
“We wanted this game bad,”
said coach Tim Grgurich.
“Ever since that loss, , we’ve

again.”
George Washington (13-14) was
mechanical in its scoring. The

Villanova, Rutgers and West

‘Virginia last night joined Pitt. as

Eastern Eight semifinalists by
securing home-court wins during
the first round of the league’s
championship tournament.

Each of last night’s ‘survivors
encountered second-half challen-
ges from opponents whose regular
season league recordshad not been
good enough to earn a first-round
home-site advantage. The winners
will travel to the Pittsburgh Civic
Arena tomorrow for a semiﬁnal
doubleheader in which the tourna-
ment’s first four seeds will

Colonials shot 62 percent from the
field and an amazing 72 percent
during the first half, but when the
machine slowed down in the second
half, Pitt snagged the lead. With
the exception ‘of a few one point
deﬁcits, the Panthers were in
command of the scoring after
intermission.

Yes, Pitt was in command, until
the clock reached :50 and GW,
trailing by five, decided it was time
to foul. Guard Curtis J effries chose
to foul Pitt’s leading free-throw
shooter, forward Terry Knight, and

a correct choice-it was. .

The loss came in

this ‘season.
Massachusetts coach Jack
Leamon’s last game as the
Minutemen’s leader; ‘he owns the
most successful record in UMass
_basketball history.

Villanova’s Alex Bradley, the
igarr_ie_’s leading scorer (with 23
points), sent the game into
overtime with an 18-foot jump shot

that tied the game at 67 less than
two minutes before the end of
regulation play. The Wildcats had
’held a five-point label early in the
second -half but had to overcome
several Minutemen leads late in
the game.

Freshman Aaron Howard gave
Villanova (9-1 during its Eastern
Eight season) its last lead, and a
"chance to meet Pitt tomorrow night
atthe .Civic Arena, by hitting a
short jumper during the overtime
period’s first minute.

Rutgers, the tournament's
second-seeded team, needed 26
points from James Bailey and some
larcenous second-half defense
during a 67-57 win against, Penn
State at Piscataway, NJ.

Penn State’s patient play allowed
the Nittany Lions to cut Rutgers’
lead to one point (45-44) with 16

4 Panthers Favored

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt-News Staff Writer

Pitt’s swim team (10-0) is a
strong favorite to win its fourth
straight Eastern regional champ-
ionship this weekend at the Penn
State Natatorium. .-

Maryland, West Virginia and
East Carolina, three ‘teams the
Panthers easily outscored in last
season’s championship, will chal-
lenge Pitt for first-place honors,
but none of the three, according to
Pitt coach Fred Lewis,
capable of winning; M

“East Carolina has a helluva
good team, but they lack diving,”
Lewis said. “Maryland, on the
other hand, has some good divers,
and a few good individual
swimmers.” But, Lewis added,
Maryland’s team isn’t as gutsy as
is Pitt.

“West Virginia has some decent
divers, but only one outstanding
swimmer, “John Havlik, who has
won the 200-yard butterﬂy for the
past two years,” Lewis added.

“There will be a lot of teams
trying to catch us, but we’ll still
probably..win. ”

Lewis expects Pitt to surpass the
444 points they totaled in last
season’s championship “because
we’re better.”

Many sports teams on campus
are gearing up for championship
competition and the women’s track
team is no exception.

With the regional championships
at Princeton about a week away,
the Pantherettes host their last
indoor meet of the season today.
The meet, against .a young Ohio
University team, will be a
“warm-up” for regionals next
month, said Coach Alfreda Goff.

Mark Schuman (100-yard butterfly)
will lead Pitt. All are top-seeded in
their events.

Pitt also is expected to win the
400-yard medley relay, and along
with West Virginia and East

With women like Marie Ribik,

probably has its strongest team

Men Swimmers Prepare for Eastem   Regionals

Swanson
To Nix
Shaving

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Shaving (removing hair from
the arms, legs and chests), and
tapering (cutting down yardage
and concentrating on speedwork in
practice) are things most swimmers
do when preparing for a champion-
ship meet.

While most of his teammates
have done both, however, Stu
Swanson has tapered for this
weekend’s Eastern regional cham-
pionship, but will not shave until a
week before the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA)
championship, to be held Mar. 22

One of Pitt’s leading scorers,
Swanson has yet to qualify for the
NCAA’s, but is expected to do so
this weekend.

“It’s a gamble, but I think I can

I win this weekend without shav-

ing,” Swanson said. “My times
probably won't be as good as if I
had shaved, but this way I feel I can

‘ do better at the NCAA champion- .
ship because I won’t-peak as fast.”

Last season,‘ Swanson, after

(Continued on page 14)

will be out to improve its time once
more before the Eastern champion-
ships.

The two-mile relay team will also
try to cut its time. Karen Bradley,
Maria Sciullo, Brenda Cherpenning
and Jane Strause broke the
Pantherette record for the event

and will try to do it again before “\

sion, was four for six from the ﬁeld
and two for two from the line for
ten points. More importantly,all
were made in pressure situations.

However, the big story was the

combined efforts of the Panther

front line. Clancy, Ellis,and Knight
hit 20, 20 and 21 points,

respectively. Added to this was.

guard Carlton Neverson’s 12
points.

“Our inside game was just
awesome,” said Grgurich. “The
only thing that would have made
the game a little easier was our
free-throw shooting. Now if we

E start hitting those...”

Wayne Williams, playing his last .

game at Fitzgerald Field House,
was scoreless, but along with

Neverson he was, as Grgurich said

afterwards, “terrifying on
defense.”

Colonial guard Brian Magid was
terrifying on offense, swishing in
jumpers from more than 20 feet.
However, GW coach Bob Tallent
kept Magid on the bench for most
of the second half, “ explaining,

. 

“You can't score if you don’t bring
the ball up past the item line.”
Magid amassed ﬁve turnovers, but
his bench-warming was of greater
help to Pitt.

With Duquesnes loss to West
Virginia, Pitt remains the city's
hope to. reach the tournament
ﬁnals. Now that George Wash-
ington has been repaid for an
earlier loss, the Panthers look to
defending league champion Villa-
nova, a winner over Pitt last week,
to provide them with some more of
that sweet feeling called revenge.

PITT NOTES: Neverson, hit with
a technical foul in the first ‘half,
said, “Every time I came down the
ﬂoor, Samson ke‘pt bumping me. So
I didn’t say anything to him. I just
walked up and pointed my ﬁnger at
him, but didn’t_ say ‘anything at
all.”...For this, one of three New
England referees working the
game called the technical;,later the
Pittbench was similarly penalized
....A crowd of 4,254 paid to see Pitt
play. . .The Panthers will most likely
play at 9 p.m. tomorrow evening at
the Civic Arena....Pitt committed

100- and 200-yard backstrokes, but
failed to score in the NCAA’s.
Wanting to avoid a similar
situation, Swanson, unlike most of
his teammates, will not use a razor
until mid-March.

Although he is_ unshaved, Swan-
son is seeded first in both the 100- ‘
and 200—yard backstrokes in the
Eastern championship.

Shaving and tapering are sup-
posed to help a swimmer swim

Only one other Panther has not

first in the 100-yard butterﬂy this

weekend, but fourth-seeded in the
100-yard ‘freestyle because he
chose not to use his razor.
