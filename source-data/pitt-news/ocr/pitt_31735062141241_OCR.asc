If there’s any of the Pitt
tradition
this university, if
there’s any of the fighting

“spirit that carried many a

Panther team to the top of
the national football ladder, Pitt
will need all of it tomorrow.
Heaven and Charley Bowser know
that’s little enough to match
against the bonecrushing charge
of the fabulous Minnesota Goph-
ers.

All the Panthers have shown
thus far is a variation of the old
Michigan ‘lpunt-pass-pray” system,
except that Pitt has yet to dev-
elop a consistent passer or punter.
We will now all kneel. . .

Outmanned completely by
Michigan’s forward wall last
week, the Panthers face the dis-
mal prospect of being pushed
around by another hard-charging
‘front line of 200 pound giants.

But of course nobody likes to
be pushed around. And its just
within the realm of possibility that
the Panthers, certainly capable of

If they don't make a fight of
it, the Panthers may be through
for the year. Bluntly, they may
take a beating that disqualifies
them, mentally if not physically,
from first class collegiate com-
petition.

A good Pitt showing, however,
a “moral victory,” to use a worn-
out phrase, will carry Pitt over its
toughest hurdle of the season with
nothing worse than another de-
feat. And the consequences could
be much more serious than that.

Pitt’s varsity is inexperienced,
but should be learning rapidly

Police Blamed
in students’
Auto Accident

Two members of the Pittsburgh
police force today were facing the
prospect of disciplinary. action by
the p.olice trial board in the after-
math of a traffic accident last
week in which two Pitt freshman
football players were injured.

The freshmen, William Kurtz,
C45, and Joseph Geraud, C45,
were injured when the police car

in which they were riding witlr

the approval of the police collided
with another car. Kurtz was
taken to Presbyterian hospital
with a broken leg and abrasions,
his physician said.

Geraiud was not seriously in-
jured.

Although the full facts await
presentation before the trial
board, it has been definitely es-
tablished by police that the two
youths were in no way responsible
for the accident and were riding
with the police at their invitation.

After being admitted to the
hospital for the injuries caused by
the accident, Kurtz developed a
s_e:i9us case of app.e_nd.icitis.

  

With the annual fraternity rush
week entering its fourth day of
social activity, fraternity men and
rushees alike await the ﬁnal and
gala events scheduled to close the
week-long program. I

Most of the 12 men’s social

fraternities University

have reserved a house dance for 2

tomorrow. The only mixed event
of the week, it will climax rush
week activities. The music of
Rusty Williams and his orchestra
will be featured at Phi Gamma
Delta, and the opening of a new
game room will highlight the pro-
gram at Phi Epsilon Pi tomor-
row evening.

Varied Nights

Parent night will be the event
tonight at Theta Chi and Pi Lamb-
da Phi, while Phi Epsilon Pi and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon will offer
theater parties.

Provost Addresses
SPA on Tuesday

Roy Ruane, C42, president of the Student-Faculty?‘
association revealed today that the executive committee}?

had invited Provost Rufus H. Fitzgerald to its next meet-

ing Tuesday afternoon to discuss student problems.
also announced that the question of locker shortage ‘and’
of smoke control in the Tuck shops had been discussed by:

the committee.

Ruane said that an attempt would be made

meeting and at future ses-
sions to find a substantial
project upon which the en-
tire student body could work and
from which a functional use of
the student body could be derived.
Ruane emphasized that since
the University is made up largely
ofstudents who reside in the city
and commute daily to school, any
student reaction at the University
would be immediately felt through-
out the city.
Effusivg Spirit g

“Once the project is found and
the student body is organized to
support it, the spirit will per-
meate throughout the whole
city,” he declared.

Ruane admitted that as yet a
suitable project had not been
found which could be considered
worthy of presentation to the stu-
dents. But, he added, the ques-
tion of a student union was be-
ing seriously considered.

Thomas Grogan, BA42, in-
formed the executive committee
that the student replies to the
locker shortage poll had been very
small and that only 22 of the bal-
lots which were printed in the
Pitt News had been filled out and
given to the committee.

Grogan said that in viewof the
fact that a definite shortage of
locker space in the Cathedral is
known ‘to_ exist, another opportun-
ity would be given students to

Soviet /°\uthor ‘Vi/rites
Don Cossack Novels

By CHARLES rmman

Fine literature is not produced
in the middle of chaos. Insecur-
ity is not conducive to clear and
lucid writing. Peace and time are
needed for understanding and
expression. '

But on the heels of every so-
cial crisis comes a flood of 8*'¢‘t
writing. lt is as if the new world
creates those who are to inter-
pret the old. ‘

Both Novels Timely

Michail Sholokhov’s two novels
__ “And Quiet Flows the Don”
and “The Don Flows Home to
Sea” —— occupy such a position.

The first volume, “And Quiet
Flows the _Don," was published
in the United. States in
after it had already enioyﬁl ‘W0
years of popularity in Europe.

The second volume, “The Doll
Flows Home to Sea," was pub-
lished in August of this year.
Events have given both a time-
liness. . i

It has been twenty—four years
since the Russian revolution over-
threw feudalism. ‘In these twenty
four years since" 1917, Russia has
been undergoing a ‘change that
took western Europe well “ over
150 years to accomplish.

The Don Cossacks!

It is the effect of this change,
its early action upon. the Don
Cossacks of the Don river region,
that Sholokhov deals with.

The central character, about
whom the story is woven, is Gre-
gor Melekhov, wild young Cos-
sack of the Don ‘basin. “Gregor
(the author writes), was like his
father, half a head taller than
Piotra, some six years younger;
the same hanging hook nose as
his father’s, bluish almonds of
burning irises in slightly oblique
slits, brown, muddy skin drawn
over angular cheek--bones.

“Gregor stooped slightly, iust
like his father, even in their
eyes there was that same savage
quality."

‘Two main themes exert their
pressure upon Gregor.  is

1934, ‘

C’ossack’s wife. ‘Thesecond theme

is his participation in the wars‘

that tear at the Vitals of his exist-
ence.

The story begins on the first
theme of love, an argument be-
tween Gregor and his fath-en,
Pantaeimon, over Gregor's in-
terest in Aksinia. Warned to
stay away from her Gregor die-
obeys. His passion mounts, spend!
itself in a ruthless pursuit. Ful-
fillment brings only deeper long-
mg. —

Pantaleimon, wise in the wayi
of tradition, decides to marry off
Gregor. A vivid description of "a2
Cossack wedding follows. But Nab-
alia, the new bride, is cold and un-

responsive. And as a year wears
on, Gregor returns to Aksinia,
His married life is completely

broken when both he and Aksinia
take flight together.

A As Symphony Soloist

I7 I. cnossusu

For the second consecutive year,
French Violinist Zino Francescatti
will appear as the guest soloist
with the Pittsburgh Symphony or-
chestra Friday evening at 8:40
o'clock and Sunday afternoon at
3 o’clock.

Under the baton of Dr. Fritz
Reiner, director of the Pitts-
burgh Symphony orchestra, Fran.
cescatti will play the Lalo “Sym.
phonic Espagnole."

Francescatti created the great-
est sensation among the soloists of
last season’s concerts,

When Francescatti performed
with the orchestra last year, Pitts-
burgh's critics rushed to their
typewriters and pounded praises
hailing him as one of the two
greatest violinists in the world.
The Pittsburgh Symphony soci-
ety reports that no other soloist
in the history of the Pittsburgh
Symphony orchestra has ever re-
ceived such acclaim. ’

(loaning from a family of musi-
cians, Zino Francescatti was born
in Marseilles on August 9. 1905,

into a world of music and violins.
His father, a naturalized French-
man, was both a violinist and a
cellist. His mother, born in Mar-
seilles, was also a violinist.

-Francescatti himselfis married
to a violinist, the former Yolande
Potel de la Briere. '

Previously known throughout
Europe and South America, Zinc
Francesscati camefco the United
States for the first time in the
autumn of 1939. He apppeared
with the country’s outstanding or-
chestras which immediately eng'a,L“—
ed him for the following season.

According to the Pittsburgh
Symphony society, Francesscati
is playing a sold-out concert tour.
ln the short time of two years, he
has established himself as one of
the great music artists in this
country.

During the first half of the pro-
gram, the symphony will play
Weber’s “Jubilee” Overture, the
American composer Aaron Cop-
1and’s “El Salon Me)'(ic0,” and
three movements fromthe “Sym-
phonic F‘:mtastique” by Berlioz.

«Abusive Epithcts Mean

.r.

By FRANK MASTORAKI

Before deciding who should aml
who should not be sent to the “old
country,” some factors should be
considered. A few days ago I
heard a policeman address a man
in this manner, “Why in the hell
don’t you go back to the ole coun-
try where you ‘came from, you
damn wop?"

For no other reason other than

the fact that I am best falrniliary

with the policeman, I will point
out the hypocrisy of his state-
ment. The policeman held to his
favor that his mother's great-
grandfather married an lndian
* squaw, making him even more
American. His father’s great-
grandfather came from Eire.
Heckling and name-calling are
every day occurances which re-

ﬂect a deep and serious misunder- _
. standing of human beings. The

greatest of all misunderstandings
is embodied in the sentence, “Go
back to the old country, you
hunky.”

The United States is a young
country characterized by new and
unexpected happenings. Its pop-
ulation is composed of people de-
scendant from many lands. Cul-
tures, ideas, ideals have been bor-
rowed, synthesized, modiﬁed, and
the ﬁnished product labeled “The
American Way of Life.”

for a period, and changed to suit
the people and the environment.

U. S. To Slaughter

By CUFFORD GERSHOVITZ

The isolationists are neither left-
ists nor rightists; they are half-
rightists. The right half is the
contention that the Administration
(Roosevelt and Co.) is leading the
US into war. The wrong half is
the belief that America should and
can remain aloof from the World
conflict.

Now on what basis can it be
proved that the American ﬂock
is being led to the slaughter? The
answer is by the process of elim-
ination. First let us ask who or
what can plunge us into the war.
There are four possibilities: the
American people, Congress, Hit-
ler, or the Administration. It is
obvious that the American peo-
ple do not want to have their

boys fertilize the Ukrainian wheat"

ﬁelds as they have enriched the
poppy ﬁelds of Flanders.

Stay-at-Home Americans

Talk to your father, uncle.
teacher, boss, or your girl and then
look at a poll or two and you will
see that the American people when
scratched are still stay-at-homes.

Yes, they want to send guns,
tanks and planes. They feel that
American participation is inevit-
able; that Hitler must be beaten
and cannot be beaten without
American men.
want a declaration of war——para-
doxical but true.

The next possible war perpe-
trator is Congress. The senators
and representatives throw a lot of
wordy smokescreens, but when you
pin them down it isobvious that
they are a two-pronged rubber‘
stamp, and rightly so.

They go through the ‘formality’
of making laws which everyone;
knows ‘are’ ‘handed to‘ them‘ direct.

‘ from the White House. “They
spend billions‘ for defense every
weekend but still play the game
of follow the leader. ‘Who can
even pretend that Congress to-
day is dragging anybody any-

'wbere?

Hit|er’s Not Kaiser
The next possible war perpetra-
tor is Adolph S. Hitler, himself.

Now whatever you say about him,

after you are done swearing, you

must admit that Adolph is no

dumbkopf. He is no Kaiser who
says phooey on the Amerikaner

lousers.

The Germans know what the
US can do and acts accordingly.
They could easily send U-boats
into “American defense waters,"
sink a couple of ships, drown a
few hundred Americans and thus
incite a war. But why should
they do that when they can at-
tack convoys in Icelandic waters?

America the armorer is better

Yet they do not

merely a finger

than America the warrior. Wh-at
with Russia on their -backs, the
Germans have enough to keep
even their skillful hands busy.
This leaves as the remaining
group capable of pushing the
American people overboard, the
Roosevelt administration. At the
outset it should be stated that in
times of crisis the executive takes
over, no matter what form of
government predominates. It is
a historical fact that a central

authority guides the ship of state‘

when U-boats lurk about.

Roosevelt and his advisers agree
with the American people that the
US must fight if Hitleris to fall.
But they follow this thesis to its
logical conclusion. They are de-
termined to ﬁght. '

People Are M alleable

They know, too, that a people
as far from the scene of battle
as is the US, will never by calm
deliberate reasoning, send their
sons abroad, to die. The people
form an enormous malleable mass
which, however, must be prodded
slowly to war fever.

Hence, step by step,
proach apd then enter into the
war. (We must admit that sheer
military strategy devoid of any
ulterior motive would dictate such
a policy).

So long as Hitler doesn’t want
war, Roosevelt will have to push
American aid so close to the very
front and make it so eﬁective
that the Nazis will have to re-
taliate and thus make war a ne-
cessity.

One may argue that American

' participation in the war is either
1 good or bad.

‘The fact remains
that it is inevitable in the light of
the present anti-Hitler sentiment
and that the Roosevelt regime is
on the hand of
fate. ; A

Sones’ Plan
F or Trainingi

High school graduates of the fu-
ture will make better husbands
and wives. They will be trained
in those “little things” that make
for happy marriages.

The girls will study the care of
babies and will learn how to cook
and serve food. Meanwhile their

boyfriends will explore engineer-_

ing or medicine, carpentry or ag-

riculture, as junior observers or

helpers to adults carrying on this

work in the school community.

. Such is the plan set forth in
“Youth Education in Practical
Living,” edited by Dr. W. W. D.
Sones who is a professor of edu-
cation and the director of curricu-
lumstudy at Pitt. This book is
one of the products of the Pitt
'woi‘kshop' la'borato"ry in teaching.
It was prepared for tri-state schools
engaged in local curriculum devel-
opment programs and will serve as?
a supply guide and source
for-.thos\e schools.  

who worked on the book stressed
the idea that students should
come out of high school prepared
to face ordinary life~problems._
one of the 11 beliefs that they
have set up as the creed of the
workshop group is "We believe
that education is co-extensive
with life” and the courses put-
lined by the book develop ths
idea. A

Here’s a comforting thought for
all of you . . Thanksgiving has
been deﬁnitely set for the last
Thursday in November. Now there
will be no more worrying as to
whether or not HE or SHE will
be home at the same time as you
are.

lt seems that people are more
concerned about the scandal re-
sulting from the .lenkins-Coch-
rane ﬁght than they are about the
fact that Harry Bridges was de-
ported by a unanimous vote in
the House.

Bringing up a sore spot in our

' college life for the last time, I

hope, in one of our daily newspa-
pers it was stated that from the
looks of the score of the Pitt-
Michigan game, the score this
week between Minnesota and Pitt
will closely resemble the Lend-
Lease ﬁgures.

So everything is bustling in Jap-
an. Well, go ahead and bustle,

Quite a large crowd was at the
Carnegie Music hall Tuesday
night to hear William L. Shirer.
An excellent speaker and writer,
but he said nothing that was not
known before. Of course, he
cleared up some points, but it
was all personal opinions on his
part.

I overheard one of the c0—eds
saying that she saw no reason for
her modeling one of the new caps
with pigtails on, because no one
here at school would be caught
dead in one. But why not-
What is there about Pitt girls that
makes them comment so sarcasti-
cally about their own female _class-
mates when they try to appear col-
legiate? Not only with pigtail
caps, but with their own pigtails,
too. The students look wonder-
ingly at girls who braid their hair,

as if it was such ‘a radical way of
going to college!

But whether we wear pigtails
or not, we can at least be sure
that our fellow students won't be
executed as they are in some coun-
tries. K And this is the world that
was wrought by man. . . .

It's a close race between “I
Don’t Want to Set the World
on Fire” and “Piano Concerto.”
. . . The ﬁre-extinguisher song
seems to have a slight lead. Did
you know that it is Mayor La-
Guardia.’s theme song?

Rumor tells that bets are being
laid as to when the Chatterbox
will open . . . pity the guys who
made dates for the opening night,
and are still waiting. Pity the

student activities and organiza-
tions to refrain from classroom an-
nouncements or any other form of
publicity which is prohibited by
University rules.

ln 3. notice issued to all activi-
ties and organizations, Mr. Bid-
dle requested that University reg-
ulations governing publicity "Tor
student events be observed. The
notice pointed out that all organ-
izations are permitted to use bul-
letin boards which have been pro-

vided on several floors.

It was also stated that publicity
for student events, supervision of
which is centered in the office of
the dean of men, should be con-
fined to the use of the boards ac-
cording to regulations.

Particular attention was called
to the rules which prohibit dis-

tribution of handbills, and past-
ing of stickers on revolving
doors, classroom doors, or any
other University property.

University regulations, it was
pointed out, also prohibit an-
nouncement of University or stu-
dent events in the classrooms, and

“I am sure that the wisdom of
this rule will be appreciated.
Classroom time should be devoted

Pitt News Uses
Student Survey

National student opinion will
again be reported this year by the
Pitt News in conjunction with the
Student Opinion Surveys of Amer-
ica, Jack de Benidictic, C42, edi-
tor, announced today.

As surveys began this week in
160 universities and colleges
throughout the United States the
questioned to be polled was
whether or not students favored
changing the neutrality law to
permit arming of American sup-
ply ships.

Official interviewer for the poll
at Pitt will be Thomas Grogan,
BA42, chairman of SFA statistics
committee. The News will publish
results each week. '

Headquarters of the survey at
the University of Texas send out
questionnaires on national, inter-
national, and college problems for
each weekly survey.

The poll is conducted so that all
types of students’ opinions are
represented. Statisticians of the
Gallup and Fortune polls aided in
arranging the college survey or-
ganization which is now in

fourth year of operation-

perhaps the best prospect. Ac-
cording to Olson, Curtis has shown
more than any other member of
the team and it is hoped that he
shows the same form to the Spar-
tans that he has shown thus far in
the pre-season drills.

Following the meet tomorrow
with Michigan State, Pitt will
probably be idle until November
1 when they travel to West (Point
to meet the Army. Coach Olson
stated that he wan trying to get
a meet for the 25th of this
month, but as yet has nothing
deﬁnite. '

Invitdfion Accepted

The local harriers have been in-
vited to attend the Army-Notre
Dame football game, which will be
held in New York City, the -same
day they run against Army. The
invitation was extended by the
Army Athletic association and has
been accepted for the team by
Coach Olson. The team will drive
down to New Yorkafter the meet,
which will be run off at 9:00
o'clock /in the morning.

The_ following week Pitt meets
Penn State at State College, Pa..,
and then comes the IC4A meet
in New York. Last year Pitt ﬁn-
ished a poor sixth in the meet.

RECORD TO DATE: 13 right, 7 wrong.

PITT I4, MINNESOTA I3

Minnesota has 9. powerful team.
Minnesota is undefeated, so far
this season. Minnesota is headed
for both the Big Ten and National
championships. Minnesota is fa-
vored in a big way over Pitt. But
what an upset a Panther victory
would be, we hope-a-hope-a-hope.
MICHIGAN ZI, NORTHWESTERN 20

A two-headed coin would come
in very handy for this one. If the
Wolverines can keep a one or two
point advantage until the ﬁnal
gun, thcy’ll win the game. But,
on the other hand, should North-
western have a bigger score at the
end, Michigan will be defeated.
Catch 011????

OHIO STATE 20, PURDUE '7

Considering and ‘ comparing
what Paul Brown's boys did to
Southern California and the trou-
ble encountered by the Boiler-
makers in subduing the Panthers,
9. Buckeye victory seems obvious.
An undefeated season is more
than a slight possibility for Ohio
Stawl

DUKE 27, COLCATE 0

The Blue-Devils probably‘ won’t
push the score past the half-cen-
tury mark, but they will take an
easy victory. Our apologies to
Colgate 897. No. 769403. Andy
Kerr -still needs sympathy.
FORD!-IAM 34, WEST VIRGINIA 6

Bill Kern has a passable eleven,
this year. But the Mountaineers
would have to be SURpassable
to come near a Fordham victory.
The Rams are still the class of the
East.

It's an Irish victory, sure
enough, but the score won't be as
lop-sided as expected. A breatlicr
for Leaky, a headache for Baker.

TEMPLE I0, PENN STATE 6

Here's another one of V those
close ones. Neither team is spec-
tacular. It’s an evenly matched
contest, with a very slight nod go-
ing to the Owls, who have not
been defeated, yet, this year.

NEBRASKA I9. INDIANA 1

The Cornhuskers haven’t met
any real competition so far this
year. And they won't until Hin-
nesota comes along. So Indiana
will help keep a clean record for
Nebraska, this Saturday.

DUQUESNE 36. ST. VINCENT 0

Last week's "Hilltop tussle with
Manhattan was supposed to be
close. On the basis of the Man-
hattan score, this one should be -a
run—o-way. ,

NAVY I9, CORNELL T

The boys at Annapolis are con-
tinuing the National defense pro-
gram on the gridiron. And they’re
adding a touch, a very adequate
touch, of olfensei to the recipe.
Cornell has been lucky in its ear-

lier games, but class will tell, Sat-

urday.

ALABAMA 2!, TENNESSEE 14

The Vols lost just about every-
thing including a coach to the
Army, (the defense unit, not the
grid team). Alabama, however,
is an amazingly improved squad.
It should be ‘a banner year for
the ’Bamas.

PENN I9, PRINCETON 0

We could repeat the Allderdice
pun used last week. But even that
isn't necessary to prove which
‘team is the better. Pennsylvania
will do that.

ten cents which is charged for ad-

,mission.

The provisions of the act
henceforth will apply to all or-
ganizations and there will be ex-
ceptions only in -cases where
members of the armed forces in
uniform or members of the Ci-

form are admitted free or at re-
duced price.

When they are admitted a‘t re-
duced price, a tax must be paid on

Freshmen

Take Test

A forecast of the probable
grades and type of work which
ﬁrst year men in the School of
Law will do, is expected to be de-
termined from the result of the
aptitude examination given on
Monday and Tuesday.

Dr. E. A. Gilmore, dean of the
School of Law, explained today
that the 45 first year men vol-
untarily devoted two periods on
Monday and Tuesday to take the
tests.

The school is cooperating with
other leading law schools in the
country by giving this standard

test to entering students, Dr. Gil-
more added.

The aptitude examination also
will be given to all students enter-
ing the Law school and those stu-
dents whose test result shows no
aptitude for law will be advised to
change to other ﬁelds. The test
results are not ﬁnal for a student
can disregard the result and en-
ter the school.

Experience at other leading law
schools at Harvard, Columbia, and
Yale has shown, however, that the
student will do the type of work
equivalent to the test result, con-
tinued Dr. Gilmore.

A central committee composed
of representatives from the par-
ticipating schools will score the
papers; results being sent to the
schools concerned, Scores of the
individual students, averages for
each school and scores of stu-
dents from all the schools will
be determined.

Freshmen Meet
At Heinz House

Mixer Dances

Freshman men and women will

Annually given for new stu-
dents at the University, the Mix-
ers will take place Tuesday, Wed-
nesday, and Thursday from 3:30
to 5 o'clock at Heinz house.

Members of WSGA social com-
mittee, directed by Mildred Fro-
bouck, Ed42, and ﬁve upperclass
men will be on hand to help with
introductions. They are: D. J.
Bailey, BA42; Howard Hanna,
BA42; William Stormer, BA42;
Paul Schaughency, BA43; and
Robert Sullivan, C43. A member
of the physical education depart-
ment, not yet selected, will assist
with games.

Admission will be by tickets,
which freshman men and women,
may obtain free of charge at the
offices of the dean of men or
dean of women.

Since students may attend the
. affair only one of the three days,
they have been requested to ob-
tain their tickets early and se-
lect the day they desire.

Smoke ’Em Too”--Dawso

With science lending a hand, Pitt students will not have to wow.
whether they will be permitted to smoke in the tuck shop. All t
will have to do is to be able to digest tomatoes. .

According to Dr. Ray F. Dawson, of the University of_ Mssiou-“ri-
one way to grow nicotine‘-free tobacco leaves——is to graft t0b9»¢.¢' ‘

shoots on tomato plants.

To study the distribution of nicotine Dr. Dawson grafted toblacc
shoots on tomato plants, and tomato shoots on tobacco stocks. He
reported that the,presence of nicotine in tobacco, its transfer «t
the leaves by way of a woody tube like structure of the plant, and
its continued accumulation in the leaves is due to its formation b
synthesis in the tobacco roots.

lt’s hard on the tomatoes,
nicotine in them. *
