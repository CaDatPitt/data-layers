Pitt students are likely to suffer
tuition ' increases until inflation is
brought under control, Pitt chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar said in an inter-
view Friday. ,

_ “This country is in the grip of,
inflation, and it hurts all of us,” Pos-
var said. _

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported that Posvar told the Senate
Appropriations Committee last

week that a tuition increase between .
' $l80 and $195 is expected fornext’

year. But Posvar said “reports of
increases in tuition are
inventions."

“Never did I mention a specific
amount," Posvar said. “I said that

‘tuition increases might well be at the

same level as inﬂation, but I hoped
they would be less.” I
Posvarand other Pitt administra-
tors met with the House Appropria-
tions Committee March 2'and the
Senate Appropriations Committee
March I0 to discuss Pitt’s appropri-
ations request for fiscal year l982..
Pitt has requested $83.9 million, an

I l8.2 percent increase. Gov. Richard

Thornburgh has recommended
$76.6 million, a 3.5 percent increase,
according to Posvar.

’ “Legislation hearings are a politi-
cal experience that is part ofthe-pub-
lic review process,” Posvar said.

tors to ask questions and voice com-

SGBAl1oca.tes.Funds for Student Activities;

By TIM MCCABE

Pitt News Staff Writer-

The Student Government Board
(SGB) has earmarked some

$200,000 for student organizations 
despite_its uncertainty over each ___-
’ organizations size_and popular stu-

dent support.

Under university rules, organiza-

tions are taken on their own word in‘

proving their qualifications for uni-

versity recognition as campus‘
-' groups. To qualify for SGB funds,

supplied by the $24 student activity
fee, a group need, only state oniits
application that it has at least 25
members and that at least 75 percent
of its total membership consists, of
undergraduates. I

A group need not submit proof of

memberships, nor must it submit the -

names of ‘members.

According to associate director of I

student activities Terry Milani, SGB

_ does not require. membership lists
‘ because of the university’s conserva-
,-tive "interpretation of 'the First
- Amendment. Pitt considers the First
.Amend_rnent to includedfreedom of
speech without proof of identiﬁca-
tion not only for political groups but
also for social groups including most

 campus organizations.

‘By ERIC L|EF'DAV|N_ ,
“Naw, man,” answers Gil Scott-
Heron. ‘‘I’m not a musician. I’rn a
.student of ‘the blues. I’m a
Bl_uesologist.” - ~ _g .
The ‘blues, says Scott-Heron, is
the black experience: He's studied
the variations: the urban, blues, the
rural "blues, the ‘been-down .blues—

--and myriad‘ sub-genres like ‘the

“Been-down‘-so-long-it-looks-like- _.
up-to-me blues" or the “Been-down-

I so-‘far-I-heed-a-step-ladder-to-tie-

my-shoes blues.”

And, Scott-I-leron has detailed

them in a 1970 novel, The Vulture, a .
‘book of poetry, Small_ Talking on
125th _and Lexon, a I972 novel, The .

Nigger Factory, again in a volume of
peotry found in the album_Inside the

One possible solution for deter-
mining a »group’s membership,
according to Milani, is ‘a re-
interpretation of the First Amend’-
ment by the university.» Pitt legal
counsel hopes to find sufficient case
precedents to show that’ social
‘groups do not fall under the First
Amendment interpretation restrict"-
ing membership list requirements.
Only political organizations would
V have the Constitutional‘ shelter
under such a re—interpretation.

Program allocations are evalu-
ated by the following priorities
established" under SGB president
Bill Abraham: .

——Educationa-I value;

4_: l

——Cultural value; _

—_Service to the university com-‘
munity «

—Recreation quality

The possibility of a petition that
would be passed to all CAS under-
graduates to determine whether an
incoming group would receive
recognition is also being considered. 2
Milani said the feasibility, effective-
ness and legality of such a plan is
being examined.

plaints. What we have essentially is
presentation by me, then a whole
series of questions and discussions.

“The first hearing, with the
House, was fairly balanced in its
focus. I was pleased; it involved
favorable discussion of our research
programs, laboratories, faculty per-
formance and faculty workloads.”

The University Times reported
that at the March 2 hearing with the
House, legislators charged that Pitt
employees are refusing to help the
university by not accepting lower
salaries or longer working hours.
Posvar said, however, that if such
charges were made, they were not
the focus of the hearings.

The second hearing, in the Senate,

dealt with the issue of out-of—state

enrollment for the medical school,
Posvar said. Twenty—five percent of
Pius medical school students are
not Pennsylvania residents.

“My main presentation response
was very satisfying,” Posvar said.
“The difficulty in defending the
medical school budget is very ironic.
The fact is, there has been no
increase in the medical school
budget for nine years. It must be at
or near the lowest level in the
country.”

Posvar said the medical school
budget doesn’t begin to cover a frac-
tion of eduating in state medical
school students."

“Therefore, the question of state
support for out-of-state students is
moot." Posvar said. “According to
my reasoning, not one penny ofstate
funds is devoted to supporting out-
of—state enrollment."

The next step in the budget pro-
cess is for the legislature to complete
additional hearings and to vote on
Pi_tt’s request, Posvar said.

Last year. full appropriations for
Pitt and other state-related universi-
ties were delayed until a reluctant
Liquor Control Board delivered
needed funds to the state. Posvar
said he does not expect the same
difficulties this year. Also, Posvar
said he does not support a bill that
would make Pitt a state institution
and give it preferred status.

“We are, in effect, a state institu-
tion at the present “me, "Posvar said.
“This bill would place Pitt in the
preferred category of appropria-
tions, which might lead to excessive
centralization of higher education.
This has been found to be harmful in

‘states where it occurred."

Posvar added that Pitt’s student
lobbying organization was “very
useful" and made a favorable

impression on legislators.

In other budgetary matters, Pos-
var explained the purpose of the
$850,000 “tax“ the Faculty of Arts
and Science is required to submit to
the university for its budget.

“In the first place, it‘s not a tax,“
Posvar said. “Its a preliminary real-
location of funds from existing pro-
grams in order to provide funds for
program increases or changes. We
do this every year.“

One consequence of FAS budget
cuts being mentioned is anincreased
push for faculty unionization. Pos-
var termed faculty unions as
“unnecessary.”

“We said repeatedly I think a
faculty union is not only unneces-
s'ary but would also be harmful to
many of the values of free discource
and collegiality," Posvar said_
“Furthermore, there's been no evi-
dence faculty unions lead to higher
compensation." -

sible departure won't change his
administrations organization.

“Walter Concrete says, ‘That's the
way it is,‘ but that am '1 the way it is.
Dig it. If Walter Concrete is gonna
go on the air every night and tell us
what’s really coming down. you
think the people who run this coun-
try are gonna tell him?

Scott-Heron is wary of the editor-
ial premises upon which most ofthe
media is based. White—owned and
operated media, he believes, has
given blacks blatantly distorted
images of themselves.

“Dig, the TV tells you that if you
are dissatisfied with the status quo,
there’s a policeman over there made
to order. If you don’t like the econ-
omy or the racism, there’s another
policeman there. You start to feel
that you will not only -be busted if
you stand up and express yourself,
but you will be busted in an hour,
while in between time they will seU
toothpaste and pantyhose. And in
the end it comes down to you doing
what you want to do and here comes
a bald-headed dude with a lollipop
dipping on your turf.

“Now, back on 17th and 9th
there, man, it don’t make any differ-
ence who he was, he come through

our neighborhood like_that and they '

would have worn him out.

“He comes on like Tarzan of the
Ghetto. I-Ie’s down with all the
natives, the pimps and prostitutes,
and he says: ‘Wha’s happenin’, man,
wha’s happenin’?’ You figure at the
end ofthe show he’ll go “Awwwooo”
and the winos’ll stomp all the crimi-
nals to death.”

But, how did blacks shift their
intelligence to the very forces brutal-
izing their communities? How did
they come to root for the wrong
team? '

“The truth is that maybe about l2,
l3 years ago two folks are sitting up
there on top of Rockefeller.Center
and one says to the other one: ‘You
know, .I.R., we don’t have any
blacks on TV. Why don’t we'get
one?’ A —

“So, the next thing you know,
there’s a TV show called-SWAT. l
was going to college at the time and
I’d watch people ghingz ‘Awright,
awright, go get’em, brother!’

“I say, ‘What you mean go get ’em?
That’s you he's going to get!’ "

And, not only does the media
seduce us into rooting for the wrong
teams, it also hinders our organizing
attempts with its lure of'notorie.ty'.

Scott-Heron criticizes many orga-
nizers who will begin on interna-

‘ streets when I was coming through

tional problems and work their way ~

down through national, state, -and
finally, city problems.
“The reality,” he says, ‘

6

is you

. start_at home and get your house

together. Make surefyour house is
about all the things you say are posi-
tive and -then move next door. You
deal with the block before the"neigh-
borhood and that before the city.
“Often times we been taking this
bass-ackwards because we're like
moths to the ﬂames when it comes to

them TV cameras, which only cover ‘

events of a certain magnitude.

“I suggest that the basic work of
organizing is not glamorous, is not
involved with a great deal ofmedia
attention. The reason we-in The Last
Poets said the revolution would not
be televised is because first you have
to change someone’s mind. ‘Ain’t

nobody gonna be able to film that.”

“To a certain extent, Scott-Heron"

believes black poets in the Sixties
became the conscience of the black
community because they were about
this business of changing people’s
minds.

At that time, a centuries-old Afri-
can tradition oforal communication
Griot experience—re-A
emerged. In Africa, a Griot was a

i story teller, a walking library, a
' -weaver of ideas‘ which connected

people’s lives. - A

in America’s cultural history, poefs

‘Pitt Spikers Unite toWin ECVL Tournament      

a

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Sports Writer

Last Friday night in a hotel ro‘o‘r’n
in Newark, New Jersey, the Pitt
Panther men's volleyball team met
for a long time and reached three
important decisions: 1) To put aside
their individual squabbles which
may have been partially responsible
for their defeat to Eastern power-
house Rutgers; 2) To pull together
all of their efforts and play as a uni-
ted group; and 3) To play the best
volleyball that they had ever played
and knock off all of their opponents
when the Eastern Collegiate Volley-
ball League Open Tournament
began the following morning.

The next evening, after the tour-
nament, every one of the Panther
volleyballers had received an A-plus
for successfully accomplishing all
that they had set out to do.

Pitt came together and won the
first tournament that a Panther
men’s volleyball team has ever won..

“We just had an excellent wee-
kend, at the ECVLS with everyone
playing great volleyball,” said head
coach Ray Reilly. “We brought
home the first tournament cham-
pionship that has ever been earned
by a Pitt men’s volleyball team since
we turned varsity three years ago.
We got the team act together and,
for the first time this season, we
played I00 percent united.

“We decided on Friday night that
we were going to do away with the
individuality that was hurting our
play,” Reilly said. “We did this and
our play on Saturday laid a good

foundation for the rest of the yew” “"

The Panthers earned the right to
face George Mason, a team that they
had defeated earlier in the day dur-
ing pool play, in the ECVL final

Although the Panther basketball
season care to a close on Sunday,
the work is just beginning for coach
Roy Chipman and his staff. With

five seniors leavingthis year, ‘Chip-I

man is busy talking on the telephone
and traveling to lure some blue-chip
players to Pitt. Chipman has already
inked two players, Roosevelt Kirby
and Charles Thompson.

Kirby, a 6-foot-7, 225 pound for-
ward and junior college All-
America, is expected to ease the loss
of Sam Clancy. Kirby brings with
him some impressive numbers as he

. averaged 23 points and pulled down

   

an incredible I6 rebounds per game.

Thompson, a 6-foot—,5'_shooting,—,i-

guard from Phoenixville, Pa. also
signed an Eastern 8 letter of intent to
attend Pitt. Thompson was des-
cribed by Pitt assistant coach Reggie
Warford as a “a very good offensive
player -with great quickness and a
good shooting touch.” Warford
stated that Thompson could be a
Carlton Neverson-type player, but
with a better shooting touch. I

The Panthers have shown interest

in Ed Pickney, a center from _New-

York, who is considered one,of the
topgthree schoolboy centers in the

match. George Mason, a long-time
rival of the Panthers, came out fired

up in the first game of the three- ‘

game match to beat Pitt, l5-7. The
Panthers were not to be denied the
championship, as they quickly
rebounded ‘ and defeated George
Mason in the next two games, 15-10
and l5-8.

“True to George Mason form,
they came out with a great deal of
momentum going for them,” said
Reilly. “They had_just come off a
semifinal win over Army to finish
pool play, aiid they were ready to
win the tournament.” .

“George Mason wasn’t the only
team ready to capture first—place
honors. So were the Panthers. And,
fortunately for Pitt, it had the physi-_

cal and skillful edge to pull out the

‘ victory.

“All day Saturday, we were ready
for anyopposition,” said Panther
Dave Mitas. '“We just went out
against everyone and did it. Against
George Mason, we were really fired
up. We wanted that first place title
and we weren't going to let Mason
take it away fromius. They thought
they had it after that first game.
They just keep trying to beat us, but
they seem to have a mental-block
when it comes to facing us—we
always" come out on top.”

The Panthers opened up tourna-
ment play early Saturday morning

against the University of Massachu-_

setts. The initial game of the day

> seemed to setthe stage for an optim-V b

istic attitude as the Panthers
defeated UMass, ‘l5-l and l5-13.
The Panthers’ second opponent
was New Jersey Institute of Tech-
nology, who handed them their only
defeat in pool play. Pitt easily won
the first game 15-9 bu_t came out on
the short end of the second by an
8-l5 score. . ' _
“We came’ out very flat that
second game against NJIT,” said
Reilly. “Wejust couldn’t seem to get
fired up and our passing was
extremely bad.”
_ ln Pitt’s final contest of pool play,
they met George Mason for thefirst
time of the day, with the Panthers
taking both games l5-13 and 15-l.
These three matches brought Pitt

The quarterfinal match found Pitt

won that match I5-8.and l5-6.

“It was a shellacking,” said Reilly.
“We beat them up pretty well, partly

NJIT. Actually, we just smoked

Nine Pitt Pantherette swimmers

(AIAW) Swimming and Diving
Championships at the University of
South Carolina today through Sat-

The Pantherettes, who finished
second to Princeton in the Eastern
Championships, will enter the meet
with the largest number of partici-
pants ever for the team.

Pitt coach Dick Bradshaw wasn’t
surprised by Pitt‘s large number of
individual qualifiers, but had hoped
Pitt could overtake Princeton, the
defending champion, at Easterns.

In addition to the individual com-

All-America Kinney 1

Jumps to Record

Pitt Panther Larry Kinney won
All-America’ honors last weekend
with a strong seventh-place finish in
the triple jump'at the NCAA
National lndoor Track and Field
Championships at Detroit’s Joe
Louis Arena.

Kinney‘s jump of 52-feet l-inch
set a Pitt indoor record in the event,
and marked the second consecutive
meet in which‘l(inney had set a per-
sonal indoor best.

Last weekend, Kinneyjumped Sl-
l l% to earn second place at Eastern
Regionals held at Princeton, and to
win the right to advance as Pitt’s
lone participant to the Indoor
Nationals. . ‘

“Im really happy that Larry made
All-America,”-said Pitt track coach

Mike Agostinella. “His jump was "I

really good, especially considering
that the runway was shorter than the
distance he normally runs to make
his ju_mp.

Keith Connor of SMU won the
triple jump event with ‘ a world-
record leap of 56-9%.. Agostinella
said that Connor is usually among

the top triple jumpers in the nation

and, while his first-place victory‘

wasn’t a total surprise, the world-

record leap is “not something you i

expect to see very often.”

Kinney’s jump (52-1) is only four
inches short of his best outdoor leap
of 52-5'/z,'which should be a good
omen as he now turns his attention
to gearing up for the outdoor sea-

son. Jumping indoors is more diffi- J

cult than outdoors ‘because of the
smaller, crowded indoor arenas. The

jumper’s runway is often next to the 

track where running events are in

progress, and the crowded -sur-,.

,rou-ndings just naturally breed more
distractions that‘ test a jumper‘s con-
centration, , according to Agosti-

Gwen Murray has become the
first Pantherette speedster in Pitt
women's track history to win All-
America honors. Murray finished
fifth at the AIAW National Indoor

- Track Championships in Idaho last
weekend, running the 400-meter
dash in 55 seconds, a Pitt women’s
record.

“She peaked at just the right time
during the season," said women’s
track coach Alfreeda Goff. “Now we
have to concentrate on outdoor sea-
son and getting her to peak again in
the championships.”

Murray, who owns virtually every
Pitt sprint record, has also shifted
gears to the outdoor season.

“My goal right now is to make it
to outdoor nationals," said Murray,
a senior. ‘‘I‘d like to shoot for an
invitation to the Division I Nation-
als, but I have to qualify at our Div-
ision ll level first."

Murray will lead Gofl‘s squad in
the upcoming Florida Relays in
Gainsville. The first meet ofthe out-
door season will give SIX Pan-

therettes a chance to show off their

talents. Murray will compete in the
