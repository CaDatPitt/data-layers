F Task Force Selected To
 Probe New Student Union

by MICHELLE PILECKI

A Student Government com-
mittee elected thirteen members
for the Task Force for a New Stu-
dent Union. which excludes wo-
men and -the Student Union
Board (-SUB ).

The task force. as originally
approved by the committee. con-
sisted of one member. each, from
Student Affairs, Student Govern-
ment, the.Black Action Society.
Commuter Association. resident
students, General Studies Stu-
dent Cabinet, Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Association.
Operations, a faculty member
f'rom the Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee. Foreign
Student Organization, the campus
media, and the SUB.,Later./Dean
of Student Affairs Dr. Alfred
Moye eliminated the SUB mem-

Cs ber, and- added members from



the Alumni Office and the Office
of Special events. Dave Bluey.
temporary chairman, concurred
with Moye.

The committee had decided to
exclude a representative from
the Association of Women Stu-
dents (AWS), with a 2-3-4 vote.
Gordon Percy, General Studies
Student Cabinet Chairman sug-
gested that women be included

in the task. He noted that other i

minority interests were repre-
sented.

Marty Meltzner. business man-
ager of the Pitt- News. opposed
the move. asking "what’s to pre-
vent other minority groups from
demanding representation?“ He
mentioned a Gay Liberation group
as an example. He added that wo-
men may be representing other
groups on the task force.

"There is some overlapping“

admitted Percy. “but that's by
its nature." He stressed that

’ "women's rights have been over-

looked. and if we exclude wo-
men. but not other minority
groups. the results of this com-
mittee will be in doubt." Terry
Milani, Student Union manager.
noted that any one group will

not monopolize the taskforce just

by its presence. .

STUDENT UNION TASK FORCE:

On the subject of the student
union itself, William Markus,
Associate Dean of Student Af-
fairs, recommended that the task
force make an analysis of the
present building, and compare it
to more “modern” structures.
“Remember, we do not necessar-
ily want a ‘traditional’ student
union” he added.

He said that the task force
should work with "other sectors
of the university who are inter-
ested in the new union. He

mentioned the athletic depart-

ment. and discussed the possibil-
ity of a student union “with an

 

emphitheater, a basketball court.
conference facilities, etc.

As for funding, Markus noted
that federal and General State
Authority monies would be avail-
able for a building like this,
whereas they might not be avail-
able for a traditional student
union. He added that funds
might be obtained from the
Golden Panther Association, and

    

Avoiding political footballs.

perhaps organizations like the
Kellog Foundation.

Milani said that the first task
of‘ the group should be to mea-
sure the needs of the groups and
look at the needs for a student
union. Then. he said. the task
force must ask if Schenley Hall
provides for these needs. and.
if not: can it be made to provide
for them.

The co/mmitteedismissed the
idea of having one task f'orce
member from the community.
Milani said it would be "too
much of a political football."

, Communist Candidate Sees Little

candidate for vice-president. be-
lieves that the momentum of the
recent Democratic national con-
vention shows a strong swing of
popular opinion to the left.

 which is "more than George Mc-

Govern is willing to accept."

Speaking at a meeting of the
Western Pennsylvania Commun-
ist Party last week in the Union
Ballroom. Tyner said that recog-
nition of the Communist Party
as a legitimate force in Ameri-
can politics illustrates a shift in
the thinking of most Americans.
"We have received. little harass-
ment in this campaign and peo-
ple show a willingness to listen."

Because of the lack of confi-
dence in society's major institu-
tions, stated Tyner, many oppres-
sed working people, especially
blacks, chicanos, _and women,
are looking for direction and see-
ing a positive solution in com-
munism.

"The capitalist system has
been-unable to solve the basic
problems of providing a decent

life of ease. while others don‘t
even have shoes on their feet.

Without workers there would be -

no prosperit_v. but private hands
are keeping the fruits of work-
ing-class labor." said Tyner.

The candidate proposed social
ownership of industry as a solu-

tion to the problem of economic

inequality. Other parts of his
economic program include:
—Taking the. tax burden off

.the poor by closing loopholes,
abolishing: corporate exemptions

Referendum Likely  

On Activities Fee

by LOIS ELDER «

Tom Bailey. Student Government President, recently announced
that a referendum concerning the student activities fee may possibly
be placed before Pitt students in January.

Bailey said. “With a referendum on the fee, we'll see whether
students want it or not. The activities fee used to be hidden in the
tuition cost. but it became listed separately in September, 1969.

“As far as I know, there have never been any major complaints
about the fee. That’s why there has been talk of blocking the refer-

endum. .

“The referendum will include a plurality-type vote. All we
need is 51 percent of the students voting to vote for the activities
fee. We would like to see the fee stay as it is. '

“PIRG brought this to a head. .It‘s request. earlier this year.
for a line item fee to be placed on the invoice was voted against by
the Board of Trustees. Because of this, William Rea, Chairman of
the Board of Trustees, wanted the Activities Fee, which is currently
a line item.‘ researched. He wanted to know where it comes from
and if it‘s legitimate. _

“I personally want the activitiesjfee because it’s invaluable. It
should be listed separately because the Student Government doesn’t
believe a mandate, a hidden fee, is legitimate.

"I'm sure the referendum would come. I don’t see blocking it as _

a Student Government role.” . _
The referendum will be announced in September allowing four

months before January. 1973. for the public relations work to be done. ' " I

During this time. the Student Government wants to show students

why the fee is there and, more importantly what would happen with-_

out it.

During. those four months, Student Government plans to meet
with student organization heads and ask them to show students how
they use the fee. Bailey said, “If they put up posters for activities
they’re sponsoring, and the cost of the posters was paid by the
activities fee, we'll ask them to put something on the poster saying
it waspaid for by the fee. V

"We're planning a mailing before August to ‘show. what money
was requested by the student activities and organizations and the
amounts they all received from the Allocations Committee.

"In conversations with Dr. Alfred Moyce. Dean of Student Af-
fairs. and William Markus, Associate Dean of Student Affairs. we
discussed alternatives if the fee is voted against," said Bailey. "If
the tuition is raised to include a hidden fee. the Administration would
control the expenditure of the fee. a

"The fee funds approximately 150 diverse student activities on
campus such as the Pitt News, Black Action Society, Environment-
al Action/Zero Population Growth, Engineering Student Cabinet,
Associated Women Students, and the Commuter Association.

“Many students believe the fee pays for their seats at athletic

activities for varsity competition, but it doesn’t”

Bailey said_the decision of who will sponsor and fund the ref-
erendum is still up in the air. He would like to see the Univer-
sity pay for it and have the Student Government run it. But. if Stu-
dent Government decides to formally ask to run it; they will'pay
for it because. according to Bailey. “The referendum cost is worth
it to see the results.

"Were willing to take on the challenge of having the activities
fee stay."

During a 40-year federal ex-
periment. a group of syphilis vic-

PHS doctors are giving the men

to treat for syphilis, but add that

and sales taxes;

—instituting a $20 billion pro-
gram for child-care centers,
housing improvement and up-
grading of schools which, in
turn, will create employment
opportunity‘;

—A national health care plan.

Tyner maintained that the cam-
paign he and presidential candi-
date Gus Hall are waging is bas-
ed not on promises. but realities.

"We will speak to you about
the things that hit you over the
head now. If we don‘t you will
never listen to us speak about the
promise the future holds.“

As a black politician and chair-
man of the Young Workers’ Liber-
ation League (a Communist inter-
racial organization), Tyner ex-
pressed the view that racism’s
worst effect is to keep all working
people from attaining their com-
mon goals.

“L~'nited. people have power.

treatment for their disease.

Some participants died as a re-

the U. S. Public Health Ser-
vice says.

The experiment, conducted by

the PHS, was designed to deter-
mine through autopsies wha_t dam-
age untreated syphilis does to the
human body. _
" Syphilis is a highly contagious

ed to suffer the disease and its_

side effect without treatment.

ered as a cure for syphilis. Treat-
ment then probably could have

periment participants. PHS ofl'i—
cials say.

them for whatever other ailments

and diseases they have develop-
ed.

Senator William Proxmire. D-
Wis.. a member of the Senate
appropriations subcommittee
which oversees
called the study "a moral and
ethical nightmare."

PHS officials responsible for
initiating the_ Tuskegee study
have long since retired and cur-_
ren‘; PHS officials said initially
they did not know their identi-
ties.-

But later a PHS official said
the study was initiated in 1932
by Dr.. J. R. Heller, Assistant
Surgeon General in the service’s
venereal disease section. who sub-
sequently became Division Chief.

by w. M. SMITH
On the evening of July 22nd I

,'found myself panting up Wash-

ington Place through the oppres-
sive Pittsburgh heat toward the
Civic Arena. Summer in the sooty
city and the populous is tired and

-irritable but still there's a sell-‘

out crowd drawn to our “dome

.wonder” by a magnetic phenom-

enon known as the Rolling Stones.

As I neared the arena 1 be-
came conscious of the streets‘ em-
ptiness. A momentous event like
this ‘and no one around? It’s too
quite. I thought. Where is every-
one?*l don't like it. The quiet

I before the storm? I remembered

Altamont.

The Arena was gift-wrapped in
a bright red ribbon which read
“Disney On Parade.”

The crowd of non—ticket hold-

“ ers was clustered before Gate 1.

Each circle of grass in front of
the entrance had become a small
campsite from which hunting par-
ties emerged to inquire of each
passing stranger. "You have an
extra ticket?"

I retrived my passport into their
Satanic Majesties' presence and
entered in time to hear the un-
mistakable strains of "For Once
In My Life.“ Stevie Wonder.
that sultan of sophisticated funk
who was the tourmate on this
Stones’ assault on the United
States. had already began to lay
the energized framework for the
evening. ~ I

His band was an exercise in
subtle excitement. The -horn
section sent out hot blasts‘ that
stirred up the already charged
atmosphere. but the crowd re-
mained remarkable passive.

They flowed into “If You Re-
ally Love Me",l then a little
"Ain't She Sweet" transition on
the piano became "I Need Your
Lovin' Everyday." The entire
set went nonstop from one num-
ber to the next and as l watched
this blind man being led from
instrument to instrument..l mar-
velled at this seemingly indom-
inable spirit and never-ending
talent. One point for man and
art.

A wise artist makes use of the
technological progress, so Stevie
added some non--traditional sounds
to the world of soul by feeding
his voice through a moog synthe-
sizer. The result was interesting
although I couldn’t help but be
reminded of the little green men
on the old Red Skelton show.
“Ba diba dip.”

His clenched fist raised in a
salute to music-power. he
brought the set to a close. and
was led. hopping with energy.
off the stage by a trio of lovely
lady vocalists.

The crowd. though still smil-

ing. met requests to be seated
or move out of the aisles with a
belligerant

For-
nerve-

stubborness.

tunately the otherwise

racking delay was eased by a
giant beachball which" dropped
from somewhere up in the spider-
work of the Arena's roof.

A tightly-packed, loosely play-

ed game of volleyball ensued
which ' captured the audience’s

V attention.
this might not have been a planned
diversion by the Stones motiva-
tional research boys because in
the middle of the’ game, unno-
ticed by the majority of spectators
the stage "suddenly became cover-
ed with Rollin Stones.

I wondered whether

“Hello Pittsburgh. " exclaimed

Jagger. The cocky jocky parted
his

pouting lips. “The last

time we were here was 1966!"

There were no doubt a goodly
number of those in tonights audi-
ence who remembered the last
Stones visit to the Arena. but I‘d
be willing to bet that few if any
had been exposed to them in their
shaggy. sullen. snot-nosed early
days when they played under the
revolving globe of mirrors at
West View Park's Danceland in
1964.

The opening chords of “Brown
Sugar” were flung into the wait-
ing ears of 13,846 of Pittsburgh’s
Rolling Stones Fans. The crowd
went nuts. From that moment
Mighty Mick and the Boys found
themselves again the sole lords
and masters over thousands of
screaming kids awaiting -the
slightest sign, twitch or limply
beckoning hand, to go ahead
and break loose with a frenzy of
unimaginable magnitude.

The stage lit up like fire as
they rolled onto "Bitch" and
Jagger strutted like no other
bantam can. His purple jump
suit clung skin—like and the long
pink sash adorning his waist
flopped wildly as he pranced and
danced about.a whirling dervish
of sensuality.

The level of heads rose approxi-
mately a foot and a half as every-
one stood on their chairs.

Jagger then brought up Keith
Richards to sing "Happy" and

everyone was.

For some reason their next
number. "Love in Vain". had the
power to make the crowd sit
down.

Then out came Jaggers har-
monica and Richard picked up
an acoustic to accompany him
for a softer more melodic tune

from their Exile On Main Street,

album.

Jagger. with a hand on hip.
asserted that "You Can't Always
Get What You Want“ but he
gave the audience everything
they needed ‘including the. one
and only Nicky Hopkins tickling
those ivories.

The Midnite Rambler fell to ,.

his knees bathed in blood red
lights slowly shipping the stage
and rose as “Jumpin’ Jack
Flash.”

The lights came up in the mid- _

die of this last number and _a
screaming. sweating mob was
treated to a slapstick scene of
Jagger pelting Charlie Watts
with something that looked like
popcorn.

Then the “Prince of Dark-
ness” annointed the audience
with holy water and as if to in-
sure the impossibility of an en-'

core, a shower of sparks shot from 1.

the right-hand tower cutting off
the thank yous and goodnights.

My fears were unfounded. The
Stones came and went in peace.
There was‘ no violence. In’ fact
the biggest danger turned out to
be dodging the cars shooting out
from the Arena after the concert.

Being a member of a track team in an area
where track isn't a thriving spectator sport isn't
the ideal situation for an athlete desiring to make
headlines. Hardly anyone. except the most astute
track fan. knows who you are.

_ At one time in his track career. at the very
start of his career. Bill Rea was not deserving of
headlines. But as time took its course. it became
evident to the most casual observer that Bill Rea
should soon be a name newspapers would have to
cope with. 7‘

As a sophomore that time for a most deserving
Bill Rea came. The headlines. though few. also
came. On July 7-8. Rea just missed qualifying for
one of the three long jump
positions in the 1972 Sum-

mer Olympics in Munich. INCHES
Germany. SHORT
On May 8th, 1971, as a

certain collegiate sportswrit-
er viewed the second annual
Pitt Invitational at Pitt Sta-
dium, a man in the stands
asked the sportswriter who
Bill Rea was, after hearing
on the P.A. system that Rea
had jumped 48 feet in the
triple jump.

He had also heard that Rea
had broken a meet record in

 

West Virginia (22 9“) and BVVINCE »
had set a new Field House

long jump mark <23‘ 5”» dur- D1 NARD0
ing the indoor season. Sports Editor

Not even the delighted
Rea. with his pleasant smile. —--j---—-
slender face and moppy hair knew what was ahead
of him at that time. _
“I was just thinking of breaking Pitt records,”
Rea remanissed last week. “I wanted to break

Herb. Doughlas’ long jump record of 25’ 3”. I

didn’t even start thinking about the Olympics un-
til Ijumped 25’ 7”.” '

Once that happened. Rea became obsessed
with the Olympics. And as he kept jumping pub-

  

licity people became aware of th-at same possi-
bility. First Rea jumped 25' 10" then his most
phenomenal feat. his jump of 26‘ 712 inches at this
year's Pitt Invitational. which is still the fourth
best jump in the world this year.

With that jump. Rea qualified for the Olym-
pic Trials and it was a matter of time before he
would get his big chance.

The record now shows that Bill Rea earned
the alternate position on that Munich bound team
——he will make the trip if any of the other three
athletes sustain an injury or- can’t make it for
some other reason. ‘

The week before the trials in Eugene Oregon.

Rea and his coach. Jim Banner registered at a—

local Holiday Inn to relax in air conditioned
peace and quiet. But eventually. Bill missed his
trip by-a minute 3 4 of an inch.

Army's Arnie Robinson won the Olympic
trials with a 26‘ 4 3 4" jump. A surprising Preston
Carrington. unnattached. and Randy Williams from
USC both jumped 26' 312" to tie for second place.
thus shattering Rea's hopes. His 26' 2 3 4“ jump.
his second best jump ever. was useless.

As Billy ran‘ down the runway for his final
jump knowing what he had to do, beat 26’ 31/2”,
he took off a full two feet before he had to and he
had to settle with defeating Henry Heini for the
fourth place slot.

"1 was confident. I expected to make the
team. I guess I succeeded in a sense by making
itas an alternate.“

With the trials behind him. Rea plans to go
after the world record in the long jump. 27' 2"
He plans to lift weights and peak at the national

 

indoor championships. -
Performing in front of 180,000 people in th
ten day period Bill was disappointed that he

couldn’t have won a slot on the team and because
of two letters or phone calls he didn’t receive.

“The University backed me financially." he
said. "No complaints there. But. it would have
been nice to receive a letter from the Chancellor
and the Athletic Director telling me they appre-
ciated my effort.“ 0’

Of course. Rea plans to attend the
Olympics. By then he won’t be at Pitt any longer.
but he will be remembered for his near miss in
"72.

Rea has come a long way in a year. A lot If

Inore people know who Bill Rea is. Well. at least
one man who first saw him on May 8th a year
ago and a collegiate sportswriter have learned one
thing. Bill Rea is a great athlete. And he. doesn't
need a letter to tell him the sa111e thing.

Pennsylvania Interscholastic Ath-
letic League stars. Bemis has
also convinced seven others to
attend the Oakland campus. oth-

_ers who have all had ample soc-

cer experience. I

With the graduation of ‘Chu-
cho’ Valencia and the turning
pro of Gus Theof0lis,. the Pitt
front line seemed destined for

,a little trouble. With the front

‘line problems being complicated
more due to an ankle injury to
Kevin Crowley, Bemis went
right to work on recruiting for-
wards.

Alan Jutca. who Bemisfeels
has great potential. will be an
important man. according to
Bemis. Jutka starred at Trinity
High School for two years and
is given a chance to
right in at the forward position.

"I‘m looking to build my at-
tacking line around Joe Lux-
backer." Bemis said. "With (Bill)
Rex and Crowley returning that
leaves one forward position open.
I think we’ll be alright with
Tony Bolea. Denny Hosek. Len-
ny Raffa. Jorge Mauer. and Jut-
ca all battleing for that position."

‘The golie position, which caus- '

ed some distress last year, prom-
ises to be a wide open three way
struggle. Steve Fibel and Bill
Haines are the returning golies
and Eric Holt is the newcomer.

"We had some problem with
our goal kicking last year. That's
one reason I moved John White
back there last year. But I think
were improved there now with
Haines. Fibel. and Holt." con-
tinued Bemis.

Browns Keep Surging;
Darken Abbos’ Hopes

The Charlie Browns. defending intramural softball champions.
came a step closer to retaining their crown Tuesday afternoon by
holding off the Abbos. 6-4. .

The Abbos drew first blood with a pair of runs in the fourth.
Bailey. their captain. reached second on a throwing error and
scored when Hyland lined a double into center. He advanced to
third on a bobble and scored on Ieracis long sacrifice fly.

But the Peanuts platoon came right back. Their pitcher, Rob-
. erts, drew a walk to open the fifth, Molinaro singled, and Turner

doubled in a run. Ebersohl was issued a base on balls," and Litile,:

Bowles and Trax all hit safely, combining to drive in. three more
tallies. Roberts came up again and singled in a pair of runners. By
the time the third out was made, Schultzes swingers had sent 11
batters to the plate, and sent six of them across it.

The Abbos refused to play dead. however. and added a run in
the sixth when Stasiak and Schuili cracked base hits. and the pitch-
er. Germinaro. sacraficed for the score.

The Abbos tried to make a game of it during their last at bats.
when Schuili sandwiched another hit between singles by Peters. and
Breisch for another tally. but the Browns slammed the door'shut to
cinch the victory. -

This «years playoffs are double elimination. so the ‘Abbos will
meet Delta Sigma Phi. and the Charlie. Browns will square off
against the Dental Sophs. — by Ierali
