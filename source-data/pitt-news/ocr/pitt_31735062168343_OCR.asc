Draft To End Soon?

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

 WASHINGTON (August 5)
 Although a death sentence
 ' has yet to be pronounced, the
draft is likely to live no more

_ than two years.

President Nixon, Secretary of
Defense Melvin Laird, and key
members of Congress favor an
all-volunteer military; few op-
pose it. The only real question
left is that of time — a critically
important one to young men who
could be drafted, depending on
when the bell rings.

Two weeks ago, Secretary

Laird told several hundred col-

legeustudents working as interns

in the House of Representatives

— that compulsory military service

can- be eliminated as early as

 June 30, 1972, the end of fiscal
year 1972. '

He cautioned, however, that
if Congress continues to appro-
, priate more for social welfare
and less for defense than re-
quested by the President,,_the es-
tablishment of an all-volunteer
army, may be delayed. He also
.. intimated that the Nixon Admin-
istration’s desire to curb inflation
could interfere '_With its ambi-
V tions to end the draft.

The Senate seems
neither to heed Laird’s words
, nor. to endure the draft for more
 than .a year. Senator Mark Hat-
field (R-Ore) has introduced an
amendment. to the Military Pro-
curement Authorization Act,
currently being debated on the
Senate floor, providing "that the
draft end when the Selective
A’ Service Act expires June 30,
1971. I

Cosponsored by Majority Lead-

:2-. ,.,

er Mike Mansfield_ (D-Mont);

Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-
‘_Pa),' and prominent Senators from

, both sides of the aisle, the
amendment stands a good chance

.‘ of passing when it comes up late

Uﬁicthis month. It is likely to be

as’

inclined ’

considered after the Senate votes
on the proposed expansion of the
Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) system, probably in two
or three weeks. ~

A similar measure has been
advanced in the House by Con-
gressman Allard Lowenstein (D-
N.Y.) and Congressman William
Stei'ger (R-Wis). Prospects there
are not so good. But should the
Senate approve the proposal
while the House rejects it, pres,-
sure could be exerted to include
the Senate rider in the confer-
ence report. i

The Hatfield amendment, de-
signed to implement the recom-
mendations of the Gates Com-
mission, appointed by President
Nixon over a year ago, would
increase the first term pay of
enlistees by 50%, boost the first
term» pay of officers by 25%,
and raise the number of Re-
serve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) scholarships to attract
volunteers.

"Because the President's top
economic advisers are anxious
to delay the inflationary impact
of all-volunteer military service.

Student Government (SG) will
present its restructuring docu-
ment to the students for a refer-
_ endum in November. accord-
ing to SG President Lenny Kla-
vonic.

Klavonic said that the as yet
unfinished document, SG‘s most
..3§«_. important project, will probably
""5-»' involve some transfer of power.
Hegmentioned that SG is test-
ing the idea of a four-man coun-
cil to replace the office of pre-
siden-t.
. In ‘September and October,
SG will provide the student
.body with detailed information
concerning the proposed Novem-
ber referendum. '

."Among other plans for the
‘coming academic year, SG hopes
gtoinstitute. a “Concert a Month”
program. SG has already booked

Other concert possibilities in-
clude James Brown for Home-

be made available.

For April. SG is working on a
project called "Freak Week.“
featuring the “Jefferson Air-
plane.','. ’

SG also plans to present Week-
ly seminars, covering such top-
ics as the feminist movement,’
black/ white relations‘, drug abuse,
abortion and birth control, and a

Week. _SG will also set as the

The Secretary, of course,
claims that politics is not the fo-

Violence Scare-  

  Closes Festival

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

The threat of racial violence
caused the cancellation of the
final day's activities of the Black
Arts Festival, originally schedul-
ed to conclude last Sunday even-

. ing at Soldiers and Sailors Mem-

orial Hall.

According to Festival Director
Tim Stevens. the decision to can-
cel the final session of the three-
day festival was made "the day
before, when it became “ . . . .
pretty damn certain that a con-
frontation would occur.‘ '

Stevens, who also performed
in the Festival, revealed that he
and his co-workers feared insti-
gation from several sources. “We
thought,” said Stevens, “that
whites might get uptight about
an all-black. affair being held in
the middle of Oakland. We also
felt that blacks might get up-
set about whites. being allowed
in a black arts festival.”

The leaders of the Festival be- ‘
lieved that the recent racial me-A

lee at the Fraternal Order of

Police (FOP) picnic at West
View Park had so intensified
black-white relations that it

might well ‘have proved cata-
lyst_ to a racial explosion. In the
incident at West View, black

\and white police officers scuff-

led, resulting in several injuries
and mass resignations from the
‘FOP by-black officers.

-The Festival promoters origin-
ally planned to head off any vio-

The University of Pittsburgh is

NASA-funded information cen-

According to one of the dir-
ecting personnel, it is practical-

Year  

for the campus police to call in
the City police in case of ‘trou-
ble. “It would be better," Kla-
vonic said, “if the campus "pol-
ice had the power to stop any
trouble themselves."

In hopes of preventing any
turmoil on campus, SG will also
labor to improve campus/com-
munity relations.

Other plans for the new year
includez‘

—— Institution, through SG, of
a bail-bond fund;

— Issuing of a booklet outlin-
ing the legal rights_and respon-
sibilities of students;

— An attempt to gain a mea-

lence by closing Sunday’s pro-
gram to whites, as they had’ the
festivities of the first. two days.
“We felt then," explained Stev-u "
ens," that by withdrawing, the in-
vitation to whites, we might
prevent physical violance. The’
first committment of the Festi-
val anyway was to bring the
black community together.”

That decision, which followed
a four-hour meeting attended -by
representatives of many black
factions, evoked a storm of pro-
test, including an angry letter -
from the NAACP headquarters in
New York. I V ‘G 9

Stevens, the Coordinator of V —
Youth & Young Adult Activities
of the NAACP locally, -said that ‘
" . we really weren’t concern- .
ed with what they were saying
in New York. We decided, "how-
ever. that even withdrawing
the invitation to whites wou‘ldn't-.:_v
be enough to prevent violence
from occurring." -‘ ;

   UCEP Programs Help

 

 

Aid Deprived Students

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Members of oppressed minor-
ities have been “traditionally ex-
cluded from opportunities for
higher education” contends Dr.
Norman R. Dixon, associate di-
rector of the University-Commun-
ity Education Program (UCEP).
UCEP thus was created as a re-
sponse to accommodate deprived
people.

The objectives of UCEP, ac-
cording to Director Dr. Edward
J. Barnes, are three:

5 ——The extension of University re-

sources to students of oppress-
ed minority groups;

——To establish an atmosphere in
which deprived students .can
maximize their learning poten-
tials;

_ —To gain recognition by the Uni-

versity that such a program can
be successful.

UCEP achieves its objectives
through three programs — Devel-
opmental Scholars Program
Malcolm—Marcus—Martin

Program (3-M), and
New Career Development Pro-
ram (NCDP).

‘P is designed for youth from
~.rn Pennsylvania who are
jically and educationally
...ed. The criteria. for admis-

I I _,~s’lons is a high school diploma or

a General Education Develop-

panied by credits in English, sci-
ence, social studies, and math.

The 3-M program services min-
orities at a national level. It ad-
mits any ambitious high school
or GED graduate financially and
educationally deprived.

The emphasis in NCDP is train-
ing for “para-professionaIs” who
function professionally but lack
adequate preparation. This sec-
tion of UCEP is geared towards

Examines Effects

an older body of students ranging
in ages 25-30.

The success of the project. ac-
cording to I)r. Barnes. has been
"moderate to good.” but the
L'CEl’ director added that he
would like to see some improve-
ments. "We urgently need." he
stressed. “additional personnel
linstructors. counselors and ad-
ministrators). development of
curriculum. and more space in
which to operate."

Stating the "the pu-blicis inter-
ested and looking for answers
concerning drugs" and that "the
majority of what people read in
the paper concerning drugs isin-
correct." Buckley stressed that
the course does not intend to deal
with any moral or legal aspects of
drug abuse. Starting from a cellu-
lar level. the course builds a foun-
dation from which the effects of
drugs on the central_ nervous sys-
tem. reproductive tract. and au-

made understandable to the liber-

What Must You Say

When Things CouIdn’t
Look Any Worse?

by DON MARBURY
Ediotr

The impact of the story tale really hit me hard. As my little sister
came to the end of it I realized that I had heard. or read it before. but
its profoundness landed on me with full force.

And I just sat back in the chair. which before had seemed so hard
and uncomfortable; completely devoid of anything except what my lit-
tle sister had just told me. My mind recounted our brief little conver-
-sation . . . . .

“Donnie," she said. "wanna hear a story‘? Well see once upon a
time there was this king. He had all kinda money. He could go any-
where. he wanted to go. do anything he wanted to do. He was bored:
he was completely board. »

WELL, ONE DAY he got this idea into his head. and he sent every-
body in his whole kingdom out to find something that would make him

, sad when he was happy and happy when he was sad.

Everybody was bring back all kinds of stuff like games. and jokes.
sad stories, and problems; but they either made the king sad or they
made him happy, and none of them could do both.

This went on for a long time. and the king kept getting more and
more bored. He woke up one morning and decided to call the whole
thing off. Well ithappencd that on this day. a little boy dressed in rags.
came up to the king‘s throne. and all he offered the king. to make him
sad when he was happy and happy when he was sad. was a balled—up.
dirty, little piece of paper.

Hesitating a minute the king opened the paper up and scribbled on
it were just four words, which read: "This Too Shall Pass."

SHE JUST STOPPED after saying those last four words. and look-
ed at me inquisitively. "That was a pretty story wasn't it." she asked._

“Yeh. I replied with a feigned smile. '‘I'm‘ telling you. a kid reach-
es 11 nowadays. and right away they think their a Disraeli.“

The humor of my comment escaped her. and she gave me a shrug
followed by a "well. see you later."

And the four words stayed in my mind. It seemed like everywhere
I turned for the next few days I was thinking about them——for I envied
my little sister. I envived anyone who could look at this sick world with
an equal amount of both optimism and pessimism—at a time when the
cloak of pessimism and complete doubt is threatening to cover every-
thing.

THE THOUGHT THAT the things we enjoy have to come to an end
sometime, I could accept. but the thought that our world as it exists
now, might one day change too. only meant. to me. change to that final

, 'stage—utter destruction.

And I wished that I was 11 again, and had never been in a race riot,

,’ or seen a policemen down an innocent bystander at a student demon-
. stration; or seen a young man trying to escape this world by putting a

needle in his arm; or talked to soldiers home from Vietnam; or heard

» the word niggar, or honky, or Jew, while looking at the persons face as

he spat them out; or read about babies dying from rat bite; or had taken

 , chemistry and found out a little of the awesome power of the world's

WCSPOIIS; 0!‘ . . ..

This too shall pass? ‘But you know. we've got to look at our world
with that attitude. It's a bit easier to do when looking at good things.

.0l'.....

. because about the biggest inward emotion you will suffer will probably

be, regret, and then even that will pass to look at our world with his

; eyes wide open and still say to himself. “This Too Shall Pass."

We've got to have this basic hope in our mindsgand hearts or we

= won't even try to cope with this sick world. .
' ' We've got to say to ourselves, it will pass because I will make it

pass. V
If we can't. if we. don't look at theworld and say this. it_won't.

The Woman’s Body

 And Her Job Abﬂhy

(Editor's Note: Mrs. Ester Kitzes
is the director of all University Stu-
dent Publications. With women's
liberation one of the central topics
of discussion today, she researched
this article, and used the opinions of
Drs. Holt and Miller, who are both
reportedly active in the Abortion
Justice Association in Pittsburgh.)

by ESTER KITZES

Should women hold key execu-
tive jobs‘? One doctor says they
should NOT becuase of hormonal
changes during certain periods in
their life. _

This statement raised a tem-
pest in the teepee of high Demo-
cratic party councils. Congress-
woman Patsy T. Mink went after
the scalp of the man who made the
charge. .

It added fuel to the women's lib-
eration movement. And. finallyl it
caused the resignation last week
of Dr. Edgar F. Berman. physi-
cian. and political advisor to for-
mer Vice President Hubert Hum-
phrey.

TWO PITTSBURGH physicians
were asked for their medical opin-
ions on whether or not the hor-
monal changes experienced by
women in their middle years
should disqualify them from hold-
ing. key executive -jobs. Both an-
swered with a ringing “NO."

Although Dr. Berman resigned
last week. he still insists that
what he calls “raging hormonal
imbalances" suffered by women
at certain‘ periods in their life.
disqualifies them from top jobs.

He called it “my scientific opin-
ion."

DR, NANCY Holt. Pittsburgh
obstetrician-gynecologist wh o is
also an expert in endocrinology
which includes the study of hor-
mones. evaluated Dr. Berman's
scientific opinion in two words:
"Absolutely false. "

Another Pittsburgh obstetrici-
an-gynecologist Dr. Felix Miller.
who has the added objectivity of
being a male. replied a little more
cautiously:

"-I have heard of horrendous
stories involving raging hormonal
upsets brought on by the men-
strual cycle. but. in my experi-
ences with my patients I have not
seen any such cases." -

ASKED IF he would disqualify

- a woman from holding a key exe-
cutive job because she may be in '

her menopausal years. Dr. Miller
answered:

"No. _I would not disqualify a
woman from holding a top job on
that basis alone.“ ’ t "

Both Pittsburgh physicians
pointed out that men are subject
to hormonal stresses also. And
like women they undergo hormon-

Dr. Berman drew the wrath of
Congresswoman Mink of Hawaii
with this statement:

“IF YOU had an investment in
a bank you wouldn't want the
woman president of the bank
making the loan under these rag-
ing hormonal influences at that
particular period. "

Pittsburgh's Dr. Holt physi-
cians reply is: "I am a business-
woman. I am in private practice.
I don't see any male bank presi-

dent refusing my bank deposits ‘

because hesuspects me of being

be treated medically with hor-
mones or tranquilizers. I am sure
the President of the United States
needs a tranquilizer from time to
time. This shouldn‘t disqualify
him from serving.

Dr. Berman still believes there
are physical and psychological
inhibitants that limit a woman's
potential.

HE SAID: “All things. being
equal. I would still rather have
had a male J.F.K. make the Cu-

To Escape The
Death of a Fad

The evolution of a political movement into social consciousness re-.’¢_'_9-,/

quires a series of semi-manipulative steps designed to entrench opin-
ions in the minds of a broad audience.

The dynamics of the black liberation movement and the drive for
peace have followed a pattern that comples the “fledging women's
lib devotees to emulate them.

The movement must establish itself as a legitimate struggle and
discard the wraps of a fetish-fad. '

There are ways.

Initially. the women's lib movement must adopt a simple, identifi-
able complaint while avoiding the pit of sloganism. r

Blacks have accomplished this by at first emphasizing the undeni-
able oppressions of economic discrimination and inequality. They
brought an ignorant public to the point of assuming that white racism
exists as a serious problem in the nation.

Once the movement has found a rhetoric-less vantage point, its
geaders and sympathizers can overlook no opportunity to expand the
asis. ' ‘

After schooling themselves with "objective“ facts and data, wom-
en must deluge the media at all levels. No pun intended, the causes of

Successful revolutions can only be based. in the end, on the real and

the practical. Projected theory can often be defeated by antagonistic’ A

Further. the lib movement must be all-encompassing. stressing
the crucial element of unity. It will be necessary to fight fire‘ with fire,
using existing prejudices to defeat themselves. ,-

 Associate’s
Ego Blown

Dear Virginia.
Associate Editor:

Before The Pitt News staffers
become big—headed. as indicated
by the insert on page four. I would
like to comment on what I call
very mediocre college paper.
Since when does a newspaper
highlight its own editor and asso-
ciate editor. We don't care about
you two. As incoming freshmen
we want to read things that are
pertinent to us and not to you.

Who cares about your article.
My Friend, An Ugly Dirty Hole?
Who cares if you were a scholar?
One can see you are still inse-
cure and mixed up. still relying
on ego building claim. “Oh. Im a
Scholar.“

You are out of high school.and ‘

I hope you have reached a matur-
ity of some sort so that you can re-
late to the yearlings. so to speak.
Please dispense with the pictures
and go back to the ugly hole in the
wall.

Another recommendation: take
the. next issue of The Pitt News
with you. Strictly amateurish.
when compared with our own high
school paper. Sorry if you are a
frustrated, desperate. grasping.
and insecure “what you call it."
Perhaps you are trying a skill that
is not you. Get on welfare and en-
joy yourself. Joan of Arc.

I am looking forward to a

rather exciting stay at Pitt be-
cause I know who I am and where

Wales System
Not Informal

Editor. The Pitt News:

I fear that readers of the report
on The Welsh Group Visit, which
appeared in your issue of 30th
July. may have formed a wrong
impression of our system of high-
er education in Wales.

The system is, in fact. very far
from informal. and the University
of Wales. in common with all Bri-
tish universities. demands a high
standard of achievement in the ex-
aminations that qualify students
for entry. .

Thereafter. the undergraduate.
in the course of acquiring his ini-
tial degree. will be no stranger to
examinations and grades. though
it is true that some universities

are beginning to favour various
methods of continuous assess-
ment in certain courses where
this is considered appropriate.

In addition. however. to their
main functions of teaching and re-
search in undergraduate and post-
graduate schools. all British uni-
versities engage in adult educa-
tion and offer courses of univer-
sity standard to the community at
large.

These courses are open to all
who are interested and the stu-
dents attending them may or may
not be graduates already. but they

Oakland Youths See Better Days

By VINCE DiNARDO
Staff Sports Writer

When I was nine or ten years old. a summer day in the streets
of Oakland was a rather ordinary thing. After getting upout of bed.
I would grab something to eat and be out in the streets looking for
other kids to pick-up a game of baseball in the alley——often going
without lunch because there was no time for such an unimportant

thing.

Oftener than not a whole day's activities would consist of noth-

ing at all.

Times have changed though.

At least for a couple of hundred
kids who live close enough to the
University of Pittsburgh.

Kids, mostly from the low-in-
come area around the Univer-
sity, have had a chance the last
couple of years to participate in
sports under the leadership of
qualified instructors with top-
notch equipment and big league
atmosphere. This year’s program

i ended Tuesday.

The Federal government. in,
conjunction with the NCAA and
the University. has made funds
available for such a program to
begput into effect.

Le Roy Weisberg, who is a
Pitt graduate and a teaching as-
sistant with a masters degree in
physical education. is the head
of this program here at Pitt. He
serves as the laison officer be-
tween the NCAA, the University,
and the Federal government.

/Along with Weisberg, Taylor
Tompkins, Richard Miller, and
Bob Kalhalter also serve in the
administrative end of the pro-
‘gram. There are also numerous
instructors and senior leaders.

the game on Wednesday. July

29 before the summers killjoy
made its appearance. Even
though the rain ended in appro-
ximately '30 minutes. the game‘
had to be cancelled. The rain
was heavy enough to also cancel

the remainder of the playoffs.

The Charlie Browns were not

_ the only discouraged squad. how-

ever. "We were disappointed
that we couldn't complete the
playoff." Draft Dodger short-
stop George Luther remarked.
“We thought that we definitely
had the better team. We really
wanted to play the Charlie
Browns."

The Dodgers would have pre-

the ages of 9 to 18. After choos-
ing ,a field. the kids spend 6
weeks in the field they choose.
They are shown slides of their
activity and then they go out
and put what they have " seen
into effect.

A day runs from 10:30 A.M.
to 3:30 P.M. From 10:30 to 11
they have a meeting. From 11

underway. From one to two
o’clock a hot lunch is served and
a movie on some community pro-
blems follow. The drug problem
and Venerial Disease are some
of the topics on whichmovies
are shown. _

Leisure-Learn is a nationwide
program and operates here under
the auspices of the Federal gov-
ernment, NCAA and the Presi-
dent’s Council on Physical Fit-
ness.

,It can operate here ‘at Pitt be-
cause of the availability of the
multi-million dollar facilities at
Trees Hall. The otherwise empty.
facilities give the program the
major league atmosphere. Mor-
gan State College and Temple
University are a few of the many
other Universities also involved
in other parts of the country.

baseman. Ed Jozwiak. missed a

game; he was getting married.

The Dodgers are hoping that
four graduations won't split the
co—hesiveness of their spirit of
their sizzling defense next sea-
son. Throughout this years 15
contests. no opposing squad
could put more than four runs
across the plate against the Dod-
gers.

Third baseman Jack Dillon

will le_ave Pitt to teach at VMI

 

in the fall. and rightfielder Jim_

Eggler and mound ace Elliot
Schiller will also graduate be-
fore next season. First baseman

Jim Mahoney. meanwhile. is
doubtful.
Luther. Dillon. and Jozwiak

were all new members of the
Dodgers in 1970. and no doubt
they‘ll be on the lookout for up
coming chem grad students of
ability similiar to that of the
three 1_970 newcomers. Also.
they just might seek or develop

a medicine man who can out»

maneuver the rainmakers.

 

Cheerleading tryouts will be
held during the first week of
school this fall. Specific times
will be announced in the Pitt
News then. Tryouts are opened
to both male and female‘ stu-
dents. ’
