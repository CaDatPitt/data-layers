Vanet Volts Journalists

David Mazer, ‘Pitt News sports
Editor and a guest on the first

“Campus” show last week, which
discussed “Pitt’s suicide football
schedule,” commented that the
show went off very well for a
completely unreherser program.
However he believes that as the
production of the show progresses
it can become an outstanding stu-
dent production. Mazer also stated
that if the discussion is on a more
diversiﬁed topic, such as the U. N.,
this week’s participants will speak
more fluently and provide more
concrete ideas.

Next week’s program will dis-
cuss the topic, “Here Comes the
Band.” Queuions will be answered
and films will be shown on band
members learning their forma-
tions.

Head Coach Under Observation
As Squad Awaits Navy Game

‘ By DAVE MAZER

Athletic director Tom Hamilton took over the coaching
of the Panther football team late yesterday afternoon after

Head Coach Lowell “Red” Dawson went to the hos

a possible heart condition.

Dawson very unexpectedly left his office at the Field House
at noon yesterday and after a consultation with Dr. Richard
H. Horn, the assistant dean of the university school of medi-
cine, entered the hospital for observation.

This is the ﬁrst time that Dawson has made any mention
of a possible illness and Hamilton immediately took over

direction of the squad for th

Saturday. ,

At present it is not known how
long the head mentor will remain
inthe hospital but it will be at
least for a week. V

Hamilton and Dawson were sup-
posed to attend the regular Uni-
versity press luncheon yesterday
at noon but it was announced there
that Dawpn was busy and that
Hamilton was called away at the
last moment. News that Dawson
had gone for observation did not
break until later in _the day.

Hamilton ran the squad through
the drills yesterday’ and kept the
same, procedure that Dawson had
used.

Hamilton had previously coacheci
the Panthers in’195l, the year be-
fore he brought Dawson to the
University. The captain paradox-
ically, has also coached the Navy
before as he\was their head man
for fave seasons ending in 1947.

‘K

structing Army troops are

' only a few of the experiences

of three students before en-
tering the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Retailing.

William Meiter has returned this
year to the School of Retailing
after being calledinto the Army,
to instruct troops. He was in his
second month of retailing school in
1952 when he was drafted.

Before coming to Pitt from
Thiel College, he received over-
all retailing experience from the
J. C. Penny Co. He is now em-

. ployed in Horne’s sporting goods
department. , -
Two 0 foreign students in this
year’s class are Zoltan Toth and
‘Ronald Friedman. Toth,‘ a native
of Hungary, cannot return to his
native country as long as it is be-
hind the Iron Curtain.

He attended the University of
Munich and during the war,
served as a manager of a ‘PX«
store there.

Wanting to ﬁnish school, ~ he
decided on the United States
while witnessing a scene at the
PX.

There was a line of people
awaiting the opening of the store
after the lunch hour and Toth no-
ticed three privates at the head of
the line. Directly behind them was
a general. “ 

He said that such a sight reall
touched him. “If the Army was
that Democratic,” he said, “so that
the privates stand in front of gen-
grals, then the countrymust also

e.’

A native of Alberta, Canada,
Ronald Friedman comes from a
family of retailers and chose Pitt’s

« School of Retailing “because of its

ﬁne reputation.”

But it was getting licked in lacrosse

the Navy plebes that got me

interested in Annapolis. My break on

an appointment came when two

"This is when thlcoach ran out on th' field for a few

awards with the referee."

They're in Step

Pitt’s Varsity Marching Band once again showed the

 results of cooperation and determination as they staged at

half-time show at the Stadium last Saturday which any col-

,.legiate band would be hard pressed to equal.

The precision which this aggregation exhibits belies
the difficulties which beset its members inworking up a
routine. The unﬁlled need for a practice ﬁeld results in late
afternoon bus trips for the 140 members and their instru-
ments. Three buses ‘are required to transport the group
to an outlying p_ractice site where they drill for two hours
before returning to the University.

This, coupled with the fact that its members are, in the
main, not professional musicians to be but students of busi-
ness administration, engineering, medicine, etc., could re-
sult in a very valid excuse for aimediocre organization but
the band has not had occasion to use this excuse.

The reasons, behind a series pf performances such as
the band displays each year c,ould be based on a number
of thingsbut basically they fall under the heading of_the
misbegotten term, school spirit. A cohesion between the

U members and a determination to follow the director beyond

the point of passiveness and toward an ultimate goal of

* -perfec1;ion results in the contagious tremor of pride, born

of identity, , which. flows through the stands each week as
the band forms on the ﬁeld. -

The spontaneous cheer which follows on the heels of
the announcer’s last words and ushers the drum corp onto

the turf is born independently, without the aid of cheer-
leaders. Nor is it centralized in the cheering section. The

pride which a person feels in a group such as this is ex-

-pressed in the form of a cheer or a hand clap whether he is

from Pitt or Paduka. _

When 60,114 persons brave unmoving lines of traffic
and sandwich themselves into an oversize cereal bowl to
watch a football game only to leave talking about the band,

it evidences a spirit which is generated not by the fans but ,
by the band itself.

Such Spirit exists without the need for pep rallies. and
assemblies. It results not in the idolization of individuals
but in the unity of aggroup‘ working toward a single goal.

The fraternity—sorority prac-
tice of reserving seats at football
games for their members has
gone a bit too far.

Last Saturday a_ group of

friends and myself arrived at the _

stadium early
so t h a t we
could a v o i d

Proposed Amen

Assemblies Overrated

by Irv Rothman
Student Congress passed‘ a
1954-55 budget amounting to
$1900 at last Monday’s meeting.

Little discussion was held, -yet‘

questions should be raised con-
cerning the several appropria-
tions to be in- I

need explaining, but no special
worry over them. The funds
probably wont be used.

that came early.

Since it was early we could see

Minority Gets Maiority”

I don’t think anyone opposes
the idea of friends sitting with
friends but it is going too far
when one friend saves 200 seats
for other friends. Let’s be fair,

fraternity and sorority people are

a minority on campus so it is

illogical that they~sHould require A

a majority of the seats available
for students. ~
We tried to be congenial and
made an attempt to getseats in
the “non-frat” Section but since
it was already overcrowded, we

_unfortunately had to sit‘ in one

of the frat sections much to the

consternation of the young man

Pittites should take note of the
$700 allotted the assemblies com-
mittee—-$300 for pep rally ex-

‘ penses and $400 for general as-

semblies. Why so much?

Surely three orpfour pep rallies
and maybe movies every Thurs-

day afternoon don’tr begin to eat’

up that sum.‘ And this year, the
amount is an increase of, $100
1 a s t year’s assemblies
budget. What was the reason for
the increase? Were assembly
funds completely used up last
time? Certainly the student body
didn’t beneﬁt.

Budget .Needed

Isn’t it about time we had some
accounting _of how funds were
spent as well as an approximate

‘budget for the coming year,

which is seldom adhered to?

And while I am on the subject
of last“Saturday’.s game there. is
another point. During the ﬁrst
half of the game there were sev-

eral injuries to members of the I

Notre Damesquad. A group of
so ‘called ‘students sitting directly
behind megave out with cheers
eachtime a green jersey Twas
sprawledon the ﬁeld.
Sportsmanship Lacking

In one instance a Notre Dame
player was injured and the group
gave out with their cheers when
he recovered enough to stand
they booed and when he fell
down againvthey cheered. Inci-

dently this comparatively small.

group were the only ones acting

in this manner, action ,which

caused other students to ask them
to"“wiSe up.” A

While a lot of spirit is wanted
at the‘ games this type is not. It
was not only a poor reflection on
the University and student. body
but was the poorest type of
sportsmanship. - I .

d m e nts

blends to impfove relationships
between the t w o university
classes. -That they failed came
as no surprise andis of little sig-
niﬁcance at this time.

But SC allotted approximately
$50 to encourage such functions
this year, and at ﬁrst glance,it
would appear as a step in the
right direction. But contrasted to

$80 for Student Congress keys for’

representatives and $100 for stu-

dent elections, the sum appears Y

mighty small. .

It ‘may be true that such a pro-
gram could be produced inex-
pensively.‘ But added funds
would enhance the attraction to

s t u-d e n t s with refreshments, .

movies, and even a- luncheon.
Informality Lacking

Certainly a major complaint of
instrpction at this university is
its lack of informality. Promo-
tion of student blends could alle-
viate this situation. But no doubt,
SC will avoid action‘ in the edu-
cational phases of our university
as’ it has done in the past. Those
funds, too, will gather moss.

There are some other expenses
listed in the annual budget, but
they are mainly for such items
as convention expenses, Owl pic-
tures, banquet, and Junior Wor-
thy Awards which are more or
less traditional. '

The SC 1954-55 budget is inter-
esting. But I would still like to
know for what the $1900 is going
to be used. ,

< I 6 MY COUSIN HASKELL

 have a cousin named Haskell Krovney, a sweet, unspoiled country ,

boy, who has just started college. A letter arrived from him this
morning which I will reprint here because I know that Haskells
problems are so much like your own. Haskell writes: “\ :

Dear Haskell (he thinks my name is Haskell too), _ _ .

I see that you are writing a column for Philip Morris cigarettes.
I think they are keen cigarettes which taste real good and which
make a pleasant noise when you open the pack, and I want to tell
youwhy I don’t smoke them. _ . _ '

It all, started the very ﬁrst,day_ I arrived at college. I had lust
gotten off the train and was walking across the campus, swinging
my cardboard valise whistling snatches of Valencia, Barney Google,

and other latest tunes, admiring statues, petting dogs and girls, when ,

all of a sudden I ran into this fellow with a blue jacket, gray pants,
and white teeth. He asked me was I a freshman.  said yes. He asked
me did I want to go places on campus, make a big name for myself,-
and get pointed at in fashionable ballrooms and spas. I said yes. He
said the only way to make all these keen things happen wasto
. join a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
on him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn’t tell me the
name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I’ll find
out when I go active. , . _
Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week and collects his
dues which are $100. Lately he has been collecting $10 extra each
week. He says this is a ﬁne because I missed the meeting. When I
remind him that I can’t go to meetings because I don’t know vvlccre
the house is, the twists my arm.

I have never regretted joining the fraternity because it_ is my
dearest wish'to be somebody on campus and get pointed at in spas,
but you can see that it isn’t cheap. It wouldn’t be so bad if I. slept

at the house, but you must agree that I can’t very well sleep at \

the house if I don’t know where the house is.

I haye had to rent a room. This room is not only hellishly expensive,
but it isn’t_ the kind of room I wanted at all. What I was looking for
was someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within easy
walking distance of classes, the downtown shopping district, the
movies, and my home town. What I found was a bedroom in the
home of a local costermonger, which is dingy,,expensive, uncom-
fortable, inconvenient, and I don’t even get to use the bed till six
o’clock in the morning when my Landlord goes off to mong his-costers.

Well, anyhow, I got settled and started going to classes. But ﬁrst
I had to pay my tuition. This came to a good deal more than the
advertised rates. When I asked-the bursar what the extra money
was for, he told me lab fees. When I said I wasn’t taking any labs,

. he said I was taking psychology which counted as a lab because
they used white imice. When I offered to bring “my own mice, of
which there are plenty in my room, he twisted my arm.

So I paid the man and went to my classes where I found that .

all my professors had spent busy summers writing brand new text-
books. Over to the bookstore I -Went, saw the prices on the text-
books, and collapsed in a gibbering heap. At length I recovered and
made indignant demands to speak to the proprietor, but they told

me the Brinks truck had already taken him home for the day. There ’ '

was nothing for it but to buy the books.

Next I turned to romance—-and found it. Harriet, her name was——a
great, strapping girl. _I ﬁrst spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours without
effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her milky little"
eyes opened, she raised a heavy arm, seized my nape, and dragged
me off to a dimly lit place called The Trap where everything was
 9. la carte. She ordered"‘cracked crab ($1.75), sirloin chateaubriand
 ($7.00), a. scuttle of french fries (18¢ the french fry), an artichoke
(3_0¢ the leaf), and compote (80¢ the prune). ,

After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not rouse
her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with my fork. I did
bird calls of North and South America. I pinched herhuge pendulous
jowl. I rubbed the legs of my corduroy pants together . . . But ‘nothing
worked, and ﬁnally I had to sling her over my shoulder and carry
her to the girls dormitory, to the vast amusement of everybody
along the route.

But it was not the jeers of bystanders that bothered me. It was
the hernia. Fortunately, medical care for students is provided free
at the college dispensary; all I had to pay for were a few extras,

like X-rays, anaesthesia, operating room, forceps, hemostats, scal- ’

pels, sponges, catgut, linens, towels, amortization, and nurses. They
would not, however, let me keep the nurses.

So, dear, cousin, if you see me these days Without a Philip Morris
cigarette, it is not because I.don’t like Philip Morris cigarettes. I
do. I ﬂip when I taste their mild rare vintage tobaccos. But I can’t
afford cigarettes. I can’t even afford matches, what with fraternity
dues and room rent and lab fees and textbook prices and my girl
Harriet and medical care.

Well, I’ll write you again soon. Keep ’em ﬂying.

Yr. Cousin,
Haskell .

But Culhane Rernains,

Two years ago in the Polo
Grounds in New York the Ameri-
can Gaelic football team defeated
the Irish ‘all-start team for the
ﬁrst time in 25 years, thanks to
the eiforts of a young man named
Mike Culhane. .

Culhane score four goals in that
game which the Americans ﬁnally
won by one tally. This same Cul-
hane is the big reason why Pitt’s
soccer team has looked like one
of the nation’s leading squads
their ﬁrst year
istence.

Besides scoring the only goal

in the Panther’s 1-0 victory over '

powerful Slippery Rock last Sat.-
urday, Culhane was a bulwark
on the Pitt defense, which has
allowed one goal in two games.
Playing c e n t e r—halfback, big
Mike gets in on b6th drives against
the opponents goals and defense

Before coming to the United‘

States, the thirty-year old Pre-
Dent junior. was considered one
of the best amateur football play-
ers in Ireland where he played

and an oﬂicer in the Panther Club, the varsity 1ettermen’s

organization.

It was in these latter two capacities that he approached
me a few weeks ago with an idea that has been a Pitt problem

for quite a while.

The trouble in short is this: the gap between the foot-
ball players and the rest of the University ‘students is too
big. The gridders hang around in the Commons Room, most
of the students elsewhere,and never the twain do meet.

_ Solution to this separation according to Ford, lies in a
‘get-together in which the players and rest can mingle. “Kick—
off dances and the such” he says, “are held on Friday nights

when we can’t attend because we have to rest up

fonthe next day’s game.”

Female Touch

_ (Editor’s note. In order to give

more complete coverage, the News

This is the first of -these articles.
By BENITA REINGOLD

With the football season well
under way for the men, the fe-
male population at Pitt has
launched its autumn sport of
field hockey. The energetic ath-
letes have added a little feminine
touch to the sports world. ‘

In addition to the regular phys-
ical education classes, Pitt pos-
sesses a top-notch all-star hockey
team, consisting mainly of phys-
ical education majors. These girls
are part of the University Field
Hockey Club, which is associated

with the Pittsburgh Field Hockey’

Club. .

The ﬁrst game of the season
was played against Ellis Girls
School on Monday. The Panther
team went down to a hard defeat
by a 6-3 score. The more experi-
enced Ellis; team showed better
team-work throughout the "game.

In the ﬁrst half of the contest,
Pitt held the score down to 2-1
with Ellis in the lead. But in the
second half, Ellis opened up and
kept the lead until the end of the
game.‘ * .

Pitt’s three goals were tallied
by Sondra English, a ﬁrst-semes-
terfreshman. The center forward
spirited the team down the ﬁeld
to the opposing goal throughout
the game. ' '

hockeyists 1S Tuesday with Car-
