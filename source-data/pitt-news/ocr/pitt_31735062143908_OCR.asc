Today marks the official begin-
ning of “Hello Week,” for all Pitt
men and women. Sponsored by
Student Congress and under su-
pervision of chairman Milt Tokash,
the purpose of the various events
is to stimulate a closely knit feel-
ing among the students.

According to Milt, “Hello Week”
is being presented at the opening
of the school years to foster not
only a friendly feeling among
the freshmen but to encouage a
true college spirit among all the
classmen.

“Originally,” Milt said, “Hello
Week” was scheduled to take
place at mid-semester, but it was
felt that an early emphasis on
friendliness would be of more
value. In itself, "Hello Week is an
opportunity. The men and women
will have the chance of associat-
ing at a series of informal affairs.

Dr. Farmer Begins

Religious Talks

Dr. William R. Farmer, student
chaplain, will begin a series of
talks entitled “The Relationship
of Religion to All Phases of Uni-

At this service the topic will be
“The Relationship of Religion to
Physical Education.” In the weeks
following, Dr. Farmer will discuss
in the same manner such ﬁelds as
English, law, and medicine.

Though each talk will be repre-
sentative and complete, it is hoped
that the students and faculty will
attend as many as possible.

Also -taking part in the service
will be the Heinz Chapel Choir,
singing Scholin’s “God Is a Spirit.”
Robert Reighart will act as stu-
dent leader.

The service will close at 1:25

gress, is open to the entire student
body. Congress and the dance
committees have taken special ef-
forts to insure an enjoyable after-
noon for everyone; we need your
whole-hearted support and en-

thusiasm to make the Hop a suc- _

cess.”
According to business manager,

Jim Jones, the price of admission-_,

was deliberately -cut so that every
Pitt man and woman will attend.
“Student Congress expects to
make no proﬁt on the dance,” he

said. “We’ve kept the admission.

yet the facilities at the students’
disposal are among the best.”

people.

State Fair Given
By Junior Class

Wolf calls in the Red Tuck Shop
will be replaced by hog-calls this
evening when" the junior class
gathers there for its State Fair. A
picnic supper (potato salad hot
dogs, and pink lemonade) will be
served at 5:30 o’clock. From then
until 7 o’clock, junior ‘girlswill
act as judges, sampling the “pre-
served fun” of the entertainment
committee. “Ol MacDonald,” a
fliver pantomime, and the forma-
tion of a Spike Jones and his City

Slickers band, will highlight the -

program.

Since mid-semester advanced
sophomores who, socially, are con-

sidercd juniors are -cordially in-‘

vited, the cabinet hopes to serve
a real State Fair crowd at -a
minimum charge.

if is Dear Editor:

 

. The University student is the representative of the nation’s
highest intellectual stratum. He thereby assumes responsibility

1 not alone toward himself but particularly toward an intelligent
1 leadership of his nation‘. The nation, conversely then, depends

on him for guidance in its problems. What now are the con-

 temporary problems that face the people of the United States?

High on‘ the list are the problems of the newly won ‘peace,

at problems of reconversion, the Army Demobilization plan, the
1 Labor’ Front. ~

The people, in their search for a. solution, look up to ﬁnd
the answers. In ‘view of these facts, is it not unforgivable that
a newspaper such as the Pitt News does not in the least reﬂect
the opinions of the students it claims to represent? College
papers all over the country have political columns where edi-
torial opinion is expressed, where the student body is invited to
contribute.- Thus the students and the people outside the uni-

; versities who read the papers have an opportunity to see how

the future course of the nation will be run. What about the

s Pitt News? If such political expression is discouraged by the

school administration, the paper has no right to exist since it

it A no.longer represents the student body. If it is an oversight or

lack of appreciation by the editorial staff, it is" unexcusable. We

 have at this University faculty members and students from all
 walks of life and with the most diverse shades of political
1 opinions. Why deny them the right and the opportunity to ex-
; press themselves? The college student is the future guardian of
T‘ ‘four democracy. Don’t let him fall asleep on the watch.

Jules Kann.

U.  . In reference to the above letter and several other comments

 passed this way, we feel it timely to once again open the closet,
f  dig out the Pitt News policy, and air it before the student body.

The Pitt News is the “ofﬁcial student newspaper of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.” It is not just the “pet”~ of those who
spend hours every week contacting and interviewing people for

In a message to student organizations soliciting their sup-

 port for “Hello Week,” Student Congress president Herky Knell

said:‘ “With the completion of the war, student enrollment at
Pitt has doubled in size and there is the need more than ever for
a uniﬁed student body. School spirit has been sadly lacking
and Student Congress, acting as your ‘representatives, feel it
their duty to restore this spirit. With the beginning of the fall
semester, some event comparable with Spring Festival is appar-
ent to stimulate the whole student body in spirit and unity. As
a solution, Congress is sponsoring “Hello Week”—a week ﬁlled

rtwith events to enable a student to acquaint himself with other

students and also University social life.”
Student Congress has undertaken a large and difﬁcult task

9 in attempting to knit a closer feeling of spirit and unity among

 

the students. It can only be successful if every student cooper-
ates and participates to his utmost. (The list of events appears

sonthe front page.) So let’s all pitch in with enthusiasm an

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor: —

I am highly satisﬁed with th
attention and consideration that
has been shown me here. My ar-
rival at Pittsburgh has made the
Pan-American ideal crystallize for
gne. Examples of that idea are
love and justice whichga man,
whom the Latin Americans honor,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, put forth.
We place him next to Bolivar, the
Liberator. In Central and South
America we admire Roosevelt not
only as the man who directed the
United States to victory, but as

can understanding, in which the
Pan—American family is one and
indivisible.

The new conception of life
which the post-war is bringing us,
makes me hope for an America
free from racial prejudices, with-
out frontiers between the Latin
and the Saxon bond, a place where
North and South Americans can
»_deal freely, thus showing that the
, lives of Roosevelt and Bolivar, up-
;holders of Latin-American under-
standing, have been copied in a
sacred ideal of universal justice.
Toward that we are now progress-
ing.

Yours sincerely,

Revised Draft

Regulations
Announced

Memorandum regarding draft
reg-u‘-Lations pertaining t-o regis-
trants between 18 and 25-:

The revised -draft regulations
of registran'ts -over 2-5 years of
age are classiﬁed under 4-A.
This regulation this group from
any military induction.

As to all registrants under
25 years -of «age between ‘18 and
25, circular No. 139, as revised
September 28, 1945, provides as
follows: '

A. All students who are in
high scho~o1—this subsec-
tion does not apply to
students in the Univer-
sity.

B. All students who have

‘ entered colleges. or uni-
versities prior to their
eighteenth birthday, who
are inducted upon arriv-
ing at their eighteenth
birthday, may apply in
writing to their respec-
tive local draft board for
deferment, support-
ing with written con-
ﬁrmation from the reg-
istrar or dean of their
respective college. Upon

doing this, the local
board shall defer their
induction until their

completion of the quarter
or semester they are then
in attendance.

The result of this regulation
is that students who enter the
Univer.sity under ‘eighteen years
of age may have their induc-
tion postponed until the com-
pletion o-f the semester in
which they are enrolled. You
will notice, however, that stu-
dents over eighteen years of
age who enter the University
are not covered _by this regula-
tion.

I have given the interpreta-
tion -which Local Board No. 4
has given to this circular and,
as government appeal agent of
this board, recited for commu-
nicative purposes.

sweet we  
ﬂowiaam

By Arnie Steinman

Well, here we are again start-
ing “Sweet and Low-Down” on its
third year. This column will bring
you both write-ups on bands, new
and old, and articles on the music
business. in general. If you have
any suggestions, opinions, or com-
ments concerning this column
drop me a note care of the Pitt
News Office.

Many peo-ple come up and ask
me “Where can I hear some good
jazz?” “Is. there any in Pitts-
burgh?” Before we go any further
let us realize that what we call
swing and what we call jazz are
two very different things. The
big bands such as Goodman and
Dorsey play mostly swing. Their
music is primarily for dancing.
The little groups “(com-bos) of
mus:icians that get together and
jam, that improvise o-n and around
the melody without beneﬁt of
music where every man is a star
in his own right, they are the
musicians that play jazz! Jazz is
music that pays off purely ‘in
enjoyment or “kicks” as the hep
cats say. .

1If you haven’t realized it as yet
you probably will that this city
in proportion to its size ‘and popu-
lation is one of the poorest musi-
cal centers in the United States.
‘Out-of-town musicians actually
shun it and many of the good
Pittsburgh musicians leave town
as soon as they -possibly can. The
name bands seldom come into
town "and when they do they never
play more than a. “one—nighter”
here. Why, bands do not even
appear at the Stanley theatre any-
more. . ~

Now what are the reasons» for
this? First of all Pittsburgh in the
last ten year.s -or so has; built up
a bad reputation among the music
business. as being what musicians
call a “square town.” It seems
that all the people in Pittsburgh
want to hear is Guy Lombardo,
Sammy Kaye, or any of those
other “mickey mouse” band.s.
Wherever they appear they play
-to -capacity crowds «but let Woody
Herman -or any other good band
come into town and they can
count the gate receipts. o-n both
hands.

The second reason for lP‘itts--

burgh’s musical unpopularity is
that there aren’t more than two
decent places for a top ﬂightband
to play in. Cincinnati, Dayiton, etc.,
all these cities not even as big

as Pittsburgh have big ballrooms,

with good accoustics and beauti-
ful decoration and; always two or
three name band.s in town. It’s no
wonder that all the Pittsburgh
boys who made good in music

’ ha-d to do so in other cities.

As far as jazz in Pittsburgh is
concerned, some good jazz is play-
ed up at Center Ave- at the

- Celebrity Club, or down on D-ia-

mond Street at Dui‘I"ey’s and oth-
er like pl-aces. At the Churchill

Taverns in North Side there is a A

combo which plays good jazz and
«ﬁnal-ly if it is piano playing that
you would like to hear, the piano
players at Mercur’s Music Bar or
the Seventh Ave. Hotel will more
than satisfy you.

Staff Changed

In Department

The commercial "education, de-
partment has undergone many
changes‘thi.s. past year, reported
H. H. Green, assistant professor
of commercial education.

A new commercial teacher who
has been added to the staff this
year is Mrs. Elsie Hawkes, for-
mer instructor at the Carnegie
Institute of Technology. Mrs.
Hawkes has «filled the position left
vacant by the resignation of Miss
Honora Noyes. V

However, Mr. Green said that
another member will soon be add-
ed to the staff. In February,
George Anderson who was a com-
mercial education teacher at Pitt
before he entered the Navy two
years ago» expects to receive his

service discharge and to return

to the University. .

Stephen Foster mouse, “it’s been

there were 75 people at the Pitt

away from his silent reverie, we

Old Oak Table

Comes To Fore

Do you know what the Oak
Table is? No doubt freshmen have
wondered about the Oak Table,
and perhaps upper classmen have,

too. Though many have heard  5
about it, nobody seems to know 1.
what the Oak Table actually is. :-;

In the student dining room, on
the sub-basement ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral, is one table, different
from the others in that it is made

of oak. The Oak Table is reserved b A

and located on the Belleﬁeld Ave-
nue side of the dining room.

.At this table, every lunc.h hour,
sit four faculty members and six
students. For each luncheon there
are three men students from _the

ﬁles in the dean of men’s ofﬁce, 5

and three women students select-
ed from the ﬁles of the dean of

Women’s ofﬁce. The Oak Table ,
committee, whose co-chairmen are '

Gloria Ressler and Florence Ca-
petus, tries to reach all students.

At the Oak Table, conversation
is intended to be in-formal and
informative, both to faculty mem-
-bers and students. Student Con-
gress conceived the idea of the
project for the purpose of foster-
ing better student-faculty rela-
tions. Therefore, if you receive an
Oak Table invitation, please reply
promptly.

Teach Classes

From the Pittsburgh Post—Ga-
zette two men have come to teach
a journalism class in editing—JC’.
Edmund Fisher and Howard W.
Miller.

Mr. Fish-er, night city editor of
the Post-Gazette, is now on a
month’s leave; he is making a
conducted tour of industrial plants,
sponsored by the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers. His
series of articles is now appearing
daily in the Post—Gazette.

A native of Harrisburg, Mr.
Fisher attended Dickinson Col-
lege. He ‘worked on Harrisburg
papers for a number of years be-
fore going to Dayton, Ohio, where
he began as a rewrite man and
worked himself up to city editor
of the Evening Herald.

After .a period of three years in
Dayton, he «came to the Post-Ga-
zette, where he has been since
1943. He has worked, on both the
city and copy desks.

Mr. Miller is replacing Mr.
Fisher as instructor of Journalism
31 for the next four weeks. He
came to the Post-Gazette in 1942
as a desk man and a “swing man,”
who, in the vernacular of news-
papermen, is a person who fills
in wherever he is needed. Former-
ly he had worked on a suc-cession
of newspapers as a desk and re-
write man in St. Louis, Cleveland,
Cincinnati, Waterloo, Iowa, and
Evansville, Ind.

A gift of 5,000 dollars for the
University’s marching band has
been made by Edward Vose Bab-
cock, trustee of the University.

This gift will make «possible the C

replacement of worn out instru-
ments by new ones of the same
manufacture, perfectly matched in
regard to tone and appearance.
The band, under the direction

of {Robert L. Arthur of the oflice ,

of the dean of men, performed be-
tween halizes at the Bucknell
game Saturday. Except for a brief
appearance at the Penn State
game last year, the band has been
inactive for the past three years.
Although the present comple-
ment of—the organization is only
50 musicians, its full quota of 120
members is expected gradually to
be reached as more men stu-dents

. keep returning to the campus. In

the past, the Pitt band was rated
among the best college bands in
the East. In former years, al-
though only 120 men would
march at one time, it usually had
a strength, counting replacements
of 140’ musicians. This made possi-
ble the ycarry-over from one
school year to another of a nucleus
of at least 1100 trained men. Now
that the rebuilding program is
deﬁnitely underway, Pitt students
may look forward to bigger and
better band, which will carry out

and preserve the high traditions ’

of its predecessors.

The completion of the Norwegian Room brings the number of Na-
tionality Rooms at Pitt to 17. It was begun before the war, but due to
the need of space, the room was opened for classes while still unﬁn-
ished. When the Air Corps left and pressure for space slackened, the
completion was again resumed. Now at last the Norwegian Room is
opened, this time ﬁnished. The work was done under the guidance and
supervision of Eric Eliassen of Oslo, Norway, the architect and de-

signer of the room.

Chancellor Views

Large Enrollment

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
speaking last Wednesday to the
University chapter of the Ameri-
can Association of University Pro-
fessors, discussed problems caused
by the unexpectedly large under-
graduate enrollment.

The Chancellor said that the
total number of students, 7323,
shows an increase of 33.4 per cent
over that of the past year.

Of these students, 843 are re-
turned veterans. “The experience
and maturity of these men and
women,” he said, “presents a need
for considering the character of
the students in their relationship
with each other and the faculty.”

Chancellor Fitzgerald also dis-

cussed the environment of Pitt
students. (‘The University’s cafe-
teria is now serving as many as
1,000 students a day.) In addition,
he expressed the hope that in the
future,‘ better housing facilities
could be provided by the Univer-

. sity in student dormitories for out-

of-town students.

Faculty participation in the
Senate, the Chancellor feels, is
strengthening the good morale of
the faculty, and a faculty commit-
tee working with the Alumni As-
sociation is effecting closer rela-
tions there.

 

50,000 RADARS

W0 years before Pearl Harbor the Govern-

ment asked Bell Telephone Laboratories to
help perfect radar as a military instrument. The
Bell System,.through the Western Electric Com-
pany, its manufacturing branch, became the na-
tion’s largest supplier of radar systems.

Bell scientists designed and developed many
different types of radars—-each for a specific job.
One particular type was standard‘ for B-29's in
the Paciﬁc for navigation, target location and
high altitude bombing. Another directed all Navy

guns over five inches.

This is not surprising, for radar development
and production stem from the same roots that
produced and continue to nourish this country's

telephone system.

  A New n...  

On Fliers

It may be startling to learn
that you can become psychic with-
out loading your schedule with all
the psychology classes that the
University offers, or -by taking a
six—w-eek course with a Swami!
At least, that’s the impression re-
ceived from WAVE veteran, Grace
Statler. All you have to do is join
the WAVES ‘and orient ﬁghter
pilo-ts to Link trainers.

Miss Statler, now a sophomore
at the University, says “'We learn
to size them up as soon as we see
them walking forward.” And, as
proof -tha-t birds of a feather don’t
ﬂo-ck together, she says they meet

_all kinds of men—from the en-

signs with arrogant attitudes to
the “~I-mean-business” oﬁficers.
Also most of the young recruits
look down on girls as -teachers, to
say nothing about the recruits. who
were drafted to learn about night
ﬂying and who aren’t too keen on
learning new things. And, accord-
ing to Miss Statler, “new things
weren’t rarities because they were
always changing the procedure.
Things. nev-er got monotonous.

If some of these things seem
like o'bstacles to you, rest assured
that Miss Statler thought -they
were wonderful. Quote: “It was
won-derful. I certainly hated to

- leave.’’

Here’s looking at another vet-
eran, but before we dash off into
the story we would like to explain
how the vets are chosen. We spot
these fellows in the corridors and
in and around the school. Inter-
viewed on the spot, they are writ-
ten up in this column without any
prearranged data. In other words
they are just plain vets and that’s
something. This being the case it
happened that last week’s story
and this week’s are both about air
corps men.

Victor Pultanovie is our hero
for today and for convenience sake
we will hereafter call him Vic.

Vic served as a sergeant in the
air corps for four years, enlisting
in 1941. He was in the ﬁfteenth
air force ﬁghter group and re-
ceived the presidential unit cita-
tion and seven battle stars.

1 Vic thinks he voices the opinion

of all the veterans when he Says
“We are happy to be back in the
swing of our likes.” His own par-
ticular “like” being medicine, he is
fulﬁlling a life long ambition in
studying it. He attended Midland
High School, Midland, Pa., where
he was one of the editors of the
year book.

Vic’s interests as a hobby lie
chieﬂy in photography but as an-
other sidelight he explains, ‘‘I like
blondes, brunettes, red-heads, and
girls with any other color hair.”

Wants To Aid
Latin-A merica
Relations

By Betsy McCreary
In Nicaragua, Salvadera Liger-
ino was a Spanish teacher in a

normal school for girls. Now she
is a student at Pitt, learning new
methods in education. The Amer-
ican Embassy in Nicaragua ad-
vised her to try George Peabody
College in Tennessee so she ﬂew
to New Orleans and then took a
train to Nashville. During the two
days she was at Peabody College,
she was told that Pitt offered some
good courses in education and so
she decided to come to Pittsburgh.

Miss Ligerino arrived here on
September 21, and says she imme-
diately liked what she .saw of
Pittsburgh. Of course, cool weath-
er is new to her and so is the
food, which she ﬁnds “diﬁerent
but delightful.”

The South American student has
studied English and soon expects
to be able to speak it with ease.
She has found everyone at Pitt
very likable and co-operative. To
her the registration was “very
happy and lively.”

At present Miss Ligerino has a
degree from the Normal Teachers
School of Nicaragua, another from
the International -Correspondence
School, and still another degree
which she received by correspond-
ence in English from the Philadel-
phia Optical College.

At home she was the secretary
for the American Round Table.
When Miss Ligerino returns to
Nicaragua, she wants to apply
what she has learned in the United
States and contribute to an under-
standing between Nicaragua and
the States.

Mike Roussos
Leads Scoring

Bik -Mike Roussp, sophomore
full back, and one of the few let-
termen on the Panther eleven,
leads the Junglecats’ scoring so far
this season with 28 points‘ to his
credit. Big Mike hails from New
Castle High where he was an all-
WPIAL tackle. Last year Mike
played tackle for the Panther elev-
en, but this year he has been con-
vertedto. fullback. His 23 points

represent almost half’ of the 64
points the Panther’s have emassed
thisseason. Mike crossed the goal
line once in the West Virginia
game, three times in the Bucknell
tilt and has four conversions to
give him his total of 281

Second in scoring for the Panth-
ers thus far this season is Jimmy
Joe Robinson. The ﬂeet, negro
halfback from Connelsville High
has carried the pigskin over twice
—once in the West Virginia game
and again in the Bucknell contest
to give him his total of 12 points.
Don Matthews, Jim Foley, Herb
Douglas, and Ed Zimmovan all
have one touchdown to their
credit.

Billy Wolff, freshman quarter-
back, has been consistently hitting
the target with his aerials. Billy
stands out as one of the best quar-
terbacks in the district. He has
not only proven his ability as a
passer, but also has proven himself
as a crafty ﬁeld general. At the
halfback posts in the Junglecats’
backﬁeld are Ed Zimmovan and
Jimmy Joe Robinson, both of
whom have been dependable per-
formers since the beginning of the
season. This pair of hard-driving

halfbacks have given Pitt’s op-
ponents something to worry about.

Johnny Kosh Captains J unglemen on Saturday;
Spartan Offense Hinges on Tricky “Z” Form

By Allan Roth 9

_It’s going to be the “T” versus
the “Z.” This phrase seems to be

the most ﬁtting preview of the A‘
forthcoming classic on the Pitt g

Stadium turf between Clark
.Shaugnessy’s T-f 0 r m e r s and
Michigan State’s unique “Z” of-
fensive Saturday afternoon at 2
o’clock. The Spartans are under
the tutelage of Notre Dame grad
Charlie Bachman, one of the deans
of modern ‘football, who has guid-
ed the destinies of State for the
past thirteen years. ‘There was a
short lapse in ’43 when the school
abandoned the sport for a year
and Charlie was lend-leased to
Camp Grant for the pigskin sea-
son. When Bachman returned to
East Lansing last year he intro-
duced a new variety of offense to
the football world which he had
just devised. He dubbed his latest
brain child “The Flying Z” of-
fense. Run off the balanced. line,
its idea is that every play hit or
threaten the middle of the line
before disclosing its ﬁnal course.
The term was applied be-cause of
the ‘figure suggested by -a line
drawn to connect each backﬁeld
position. "I‘he_results were gratify-
ing in its ﬁrst year of inception as
State bowled over six opponents,
bowing only to Don F'aurot’s. Uni-
versity of Missouri ‘Tigers by a
count -of 13-7.

Spearheading the State attack
is triple-threat Jack Breslin, a
190-pound brilliant -‘fullback from
Battl-e Creek, who is being rated
as the greatest Spartan backﬁelder
since Johnny Pingel roamed the
chalk stripes for rMich—State. Bres-’
lin was the workhorse of the 1944

given annually to the outstanding
footballer at !Michigan State. He
climaxed the season starring as
a member of the East s-quad in the
Shrine game at San Francisco.
‘Rounding out ’State’s number
one ﬂeet of pigskin toters are, at
the halves, Fred Aronson, a. 172
pounder from Chicago Austin ll-Iigh

165 pounds and stands a mere
5.6.'Ludwig is the only newcomer
in the starting backﬁeld and his
coaches rate him as the outstand-
ing passer on the squad.

The Green and White will prob-
ably line up at the kickoff with

only three veteran linemen. Of
these Brady Sullivan, center and
honorary captain of last year’s
Spartans has seen -the most action.
The other lettermen are Dick Mas-
such, a 6 ft. 1 end who started his
college career'at tackle but was
returned this year" to his ﬁrst love,
at a terminal; and Bob Lamssies
of South Haven, an 185-pound
guard. ‘Others who may be in
there for the starting whistle are
Tino Barbas, a tall, rangy end
from Detroit Cooley; Dan. Gold-
smith, big 6.3 and 206 ‘pound
tackle from Flint and a veteran
of the AAF; 190--pound Don Black,
an out—of-stater from Toledo, Ohio
where he learned to play a bruising
guard; and 17 year old Kent Esh-
baugh who was considered the
prize among high school linemen
last y-ear at Grand Rapids and this
season has proven his readiness
for big-time ‘collegiate competi-
tion as a varsity tackle. The Pan-
ther line- will outweigh the visitors
by a. few pounds per man.-

The Panthers will outweigh their
opponents a few pounds per man
but can be counted on to offset this
with speed. Thus far this fall the
Staters have gone into action
twice. In their season lidlifter
they journeyed to Ann Arbor
Arbor where Don Dworsky, John-
ny Poinsetto and company led the
Michigan Wolverines to a crushing
40-'0 conquest over State. Last
Saturday afternoon Michigan State
entertained Bernie Shively’s Ken-
tucky Wildcats and eeked out a
7-6 shaving over the southerners.

Ordinarily the Michigan State
clash would be considered as noth-
ing more than a warmup for Notre
Dame, the Panther’s next oppon-
ent. However with a mastermind
like that of Bachman guiding the
destinies of the visitors combined
with the strange “Z” formation
which Shaughnessy’s gridders
know little about, the enemy can
prove very dangerous.

Coach Shaughnessy will proba-
blyﬁeld the same club which has
been so successful in their last
two starts. The Panther line from
end to end has been performing in
great style, and have been arous-
ing much comment among Mon-
day Morning Quarterbacks in the
East. Veterans George Ranii and
Fran Mattioli have acted as a
steadying force in keeping the line
as a solid charging force. Besides
Ranii and Mattioli in the guard
positions, Bill vMcPeak and Leo
Skladany have handled the ends in
ﬁne fashion and Tony Chufﬁ and
George “‘Buck” Johnson are the
guards. John Kosh will be at cen-
ter and will act as captain in the
Michigan State contest.

Traditional Pep Rally
Spirits Team On

The ﬁrst of this year’s series of
traditional pep assembles took
place at 11:30 o’clock Thursday,
at the Bigelow Boulevard side of
the Cathedral.

Band selections and cheers were
interspersed with talks by Bob

Prince, well-known sports-caster '

and former Pitt student and Coach
Shaughnessy, both of whom placed
emphasis on “ . . great poten-
tialities . . . but we should avoid
over-optimism in View of our
tough schedule.”

Also high-lighting the speaking
program was Fran Mattioli, star
guard, who introduced the captain
elect of Saturday’s game, Ed Zim-
movan and other members of the
varsity squad. Ed promised, “We
are determined to work hard—no

let-downs in the second half.”

Although quarterbacking is an
old business for Bill Wolff, he
says college football is something
altogether new and different. Bill,
a 175 pound, 25 .feet 10% inch
freshman from St. Clair, is well

rehearsed in the quarterback po- -

sition, for he played that spot for
four years on «his high school team.

I suppose you fans have noticed
the display of passing Pitt has
shown in their ﬁrst three games.
Well, Bill is the b-oy on the passing
end of that ball. A Physical Edu-
cation major here at pitt, Bill
hopes to become a football coach
someday. He thinks. Pitt is a.very
ﬁne school and everybody’ and
everything around the school are
just swell.

When it comes to the ﬁeld of
likes and dislikes, Bill is a Very
versatile lad and is very'easy to
please. He shows quite a bit of
talent out on the football ﬁeld,
but football isn’t his only interest.
There’s the trumpet. .He’s a gre-at
lover of music, both slow pieces
and jazz although he prefers it
on the mellow side. Of course,
football is his tavorite sport, but
he likes lbasebalel and basketball
almost as -well. Eating is ‘his
favorite pastime, and, as he puts
it, 1 '
Food is food. I like it all.

As for the woman situation, Bill
is quite deﬁnite on that. L
I like ’em. Sure, who doesn’t?

he -disliked, but there just isn’t
anything. at the moment. '

The ﬁrst whole-hearted display of school spirit in the Shaugh-

.nessy era at Pitt took place at the pep rally, last Thursday, on the

Bigelow Boulevard side ofthe Cathedral. Let’s call that rally the
warm up for the Notre Dame get together scheduled for next week.
We may as well say we are practically starting out new, just as the
football teamvdid this fall. The majority of th_is year’s enrollment are

freshmen and had never heard Pitt cheers and songs before.

The

cheerleaders did a

S, teaching the cheers and the results

were evident Saturday. The band
added. the necessary color to the
rally along with the Panther and
Bob Prince. We are off to a good
start and now isn’t the time to
let the boys down.
A Survey of the Team

The records show two victories
for Pitt against one defeat. The
loss was handed down by a Big

‘Ten foe where the best collegiate

football is‘ played, while our vic-
tories are over teams which aren’t
even in\,our class. A glance at the
line tells why we have scored 64
points against 23. At the present
the line is far ahead of the back-

.ﬁeld in playing a consistent game

of ball. Leo Skladany and Bill
McKeap are playing a bang up
Both have
spilled the enemy in their own
backﬁeld for many a loss and those
four hands haul in passes at every
game. The writers downtown ex-
pect to see Leo ﬁll in that end
spot as well as Mugsy did in a few
years. At the tackles, Buck John-
son and Tony Chufﬁ are making a
name for themselves. Buck is- one
swell ball player and is capable of
ﬁlling in any spot on the team.

‘Some consider him the best athlete
A ' since Sutherland’.s time. Two vet-
" erans, as far as service on the

gridiron goes, are George Ranii

and Fran Mattioli. This pair is

rated as one of the best in the
East.

Monday and so announced her en-
gagement to Buddy White of the
Army.

Weddings en masse from the
Zeta’s——June Kratt and Lt. Kelso,
Bonnie Goldie and Harold Cornell,

Army ins and outs still hold a
large part of the fraternity spot-
light this week. Just to prove it,
the Phi Delt’s are planning a big
welcome for all their vets in the

very near future. Phi Kappa made
an even swap with Uncle Sam, J.
Goodworth dofﬁng and Ray Wacht
donning the uniform. From Clyde
Street comes word that the return
of Dick Brock was marked by the
Pi KA’s with a dance following
the Bucknell game. Not to be
outdone, Sigma Chi reports Jim
McConnell and Dick Foster home
on furloughs from the A.A.F.
These boys are apparently home at
an opportune moment, for, they
with their fraters, will attend a
dance at P.C.W. this Saturday.

This week’s initiations are mo-'
nopolized by the SAE’s who wel-
come Jerry Aland and AndyﬂMa-
lanos as new brothers. The ﬁrst
social event for Jerry and Andy
as actives will be a joint dance
with SAE’s Tech Chapter at the
latter’s house. Phi Ep announces
the pledging of Herb Margolis.
The Webster hall will also play
host soon to a swimming party
and dance.

Bucknell game celebrations in-
clude a Phi Gam dinner dance, a
Delt picnic, and a Pi Lam skirt
and sweater hop. From the same
houses come the following addi-
tional communications. The Phi
Gam’s held a tea dance for the
Kappa’s last Thursday, and plan
one for the Phi Mu’s tomorrow.
Fraternization is evidently here to
stay, for the Delt’s are also going
in for some. Today they hold a
tea dance with the DZ’s and Sat-
urday they waltz with the Theta’s.

Complete Report on Pearl Harbor
Should be Aired Now B

By Jim Pettican
PEARL HARBOR! What does
that name mean to you? To wide-
ly awake, well-informed college
students of today, it poses’ a di-

lemma. To future students of his-'

tory and. political science, it may
well mark a momentous turning
point in the history of our nation.
During the war, our watchword
was “Remember ‘Pearl Harbor.”
Currently, some of the country’s
most 'powerful and inﬂuential -pol-
iticians would like us to “forget
Pearl Harbor.”

At the present time, various in-
vestigations of the tragedy have
been made and others are still in
progress. The Isolationists led by
John T. Flynn are screaming that
Mr. Roosevelt actually trapped the
Japs into attacking us at Pearl
Harbor. Various other groups are
presenting somewhat more mod-
erate views on the subject. How-
ever, one thing is certain. The
American People are -entitled to
know the truth—the whole: truth
-—about Pearl Harbor, not for the
purpose of slinging mud or satisfy-
ing a few sensation-seeking poli-
ticians, but fo-r a greater cause and
a greater glory. We must know so
we can be certain that nothing like
it can ever happen again. Though
we can never repay the debt we
owe to the men who gave their all
in l1istory’s greatest conﬂict, safe-
guarding the future of their chil-
dren and their children’s children
may at least represent a small
to-ken payment.

Everyone who follows current
events should be familiar with the
facts that have been uncovered by
the investigations made up to this
date. Throughout 1941, the Unit-
ed States was woefully un-prepar-
ed in the Paciﬁc because of Lend-
Lease and the need for patrolling
Atlantic waters. In fact, right up
to December 7, there were not
enough heavy bombers in Hawaii
to maintain patrols covering a full
360 degrees radius of the islands.
Prince Konoye was the Japanese

Premier. He has always been re-
garded as a «moderate as opposed
to the extreme militarists. ‘The
Prince is said to have wanted to
meet Mr. Roosevelt somewhere on
U. S. soil (probably Hawaii or
Alaska) and discuss effecting a
peace with China. However, our
State Department was never fully
convinced of his sincerity and the
meeting never took place.

Nevertheless, there remains the
conjecture that the Prince might
have proved the springboard for
establishing some sort of agree-
ment with regard to China. Fin-
ally, on October 16, Konoye’s cab-
inet fell and the extreme militar-
ists under Tojo took over the reins
of the government. Since our oil
and other embargoes against
Japan had cut her off from vital
war supplies and made it neces-
sary for her either to give up the
war with China or gain access to
the rich resources of Malaya and
the Dutch East Indies, it then be-
came a matter of where she would
strike and under what conditions.

We received one unexpected
break when our alert de-coding
experts cracked the Japanese “ul-
tra” code. This enabled us to inter-
cept their -most hush-hush mes-
sages. From here on, the problem
becomes more complex. The pres-
ident of the United States is com-
mander—in-‘chief of all the armed
forces and also the titular head‘
of the government. The policies he
exercises in this dual capacity
should normally be in accord, with
one -complimenting the other. Yet,
this is not the way Mr. Roosevelt
handled the situation in 1941. The
State Department under his guid-
ance was threatening Japan with
ultimatums, while on the other
hand, as commander-in—chief of
the armed forces, he had been in-
formed by the heads of the Army
and Navy that we were danger-
ously weak in the Paciﬁc, and ut-
terly incapable of even attempting
to enforce any threats the State
Department might make.

It is also well to point out here
that the liason between Washing-
ton and our commanders in the
Paciﬁc, at this time, was so inept
as to be almost non—existent.
Though some of the blame may
rest with Admiral Kimmel and
General Short, they certainly can
not be held responsible for things
Washington never informed them
about. (Ed. Note: For a more de-

tailed factual summary of ' the
events leading up to Pearl Har-
bor, we refer you to John Cham-
berla.in’s article» in the September
24 issue of Life magazine.)

To one in possession of the facts
that are known to date, it seems
rather certain that Mr. Roosevelt
knew the Japs were goi.ng'to at-
tack us soon. There is still a strong

element of doubt, however,_ as to ‘

whether or not he had any idea as
to the locality where the attack
would take place. -Since the task
force which made the attack
would take place. Since the task
force which made the attack. mov-
ed under complete radio silence,
its location could not have been
revealed by" any intercepted radio
messages. The current consensus
of opinion is that Mr. Roosevelt
expected. the blow to fall much
farther west than Pearl Harbor.
Still, there is evidence to point
out that on December 6, messages
were intercepted‘, dealing’ with the
Japanese “peace” envoys who
were then on their way to Wash-
ington, which revealed that the
attack was eminent. Why General
Short and Admiral Kimmel were
not inzf-ormed of this by radio tele-
phone, the fastest means Washing-
ton had of communicating with
them, is not yet known. Thus, this
is where the story stands at this
date.

In recent weeks, Walter Win-.
chell and other rabid New Dealers
have been shouting that we should
allow Mr. Roosevelt to “rest in
peace” and have been picturing
the Pearl Harbor investigation as
a sort of ghoulish aiid despoiling

enterprise. It might be well for v

Mr. Winchell to stop and consider
that - these tactics are doing his
cause more harm than good. For
the louder Mr. Winchell and his
cohorts shout, the more suspicious
the people are becoming about
just what it is they have to cover.

When the entire truth has been
uncovered and the blame correct-
ly placed, the American people
will have "fully learned a lesson
they must never forget. In the fu-
ture, we must bring about an
alignment of the ‘various branches
of our government so that they
will always pull together coopera-
tively in pursuit of one common
policy and n-eve-r again tug against
one another in. futile attempts to
reach opposite and incompatible
goals.
