April 20 has been agreed

if Congress. Councl Agree
  On Spring Electon Date

upon as tl1e election date for

, both Student Congress and Men ’s Council, while April 13 has

been set as the date for the VVSGA election according to an-
,-nouncements received from the groups involved.
Previousl_v Student Congress and Men ’s Council had been

at odds regarding the date for

their election. This year Larry

Burwinkle, president of Student Congress, sought to have the

Congress’ election
usual in order that the Congress-
elects could sit with this year’s
Congress for a number of imeet-
ings.

The difliculty arose between the
two governing organizations be-
cause Men’s Council was in the
process of drastically amending its
constitution, a process which is
now completed.

In the past the elections had al-
ways been held on the same day,
thus eliminating the necessity of
having men students vote twice.

Congress on Monday, voted

'down a motion that it have the

power to regulateutime, place, and
conducting of all student elections.

The motion was introduced by
Tom Ryan to increase efﬁciency
and to determine whether or not
Student Congress is the senior
governing body.

There was much debate onthe
motion before it was put to ques-
tion. Theodore W. Biddle, Dean
of Men, said that “the founding
fathers provided for three gov-
erning groups: one to govern men’s
affairs, one to govern women's af-
fairs, and one to govern joint ac-
tivities. None of the organizations
have supreme power.”

Tom Ryan and _Bob S-ilberstein,
Congress delegates to the recent
Conference on Christian Colleges

\

earlier than’

in China at Syracuse, N. Y., re-
ported that the problem of Lin-
guan University, Pitt in China,
since the advent of communism
was discussed.

The conference advanced the
theory that if the Chinese Coin-
munists- left the curriculum and
administration of the school as it
was, Pitt should continue support-
ing the Chinese school with the
Pitt Chest funds. '~ Otherwise the
funds shouldbe discontinued.

Bob Kingsley, treasurer, 'an-
nounced that the budget for next
year was being prepared and that
provision would be made for the
newly-formed poll committee.

Of Players in Show Offering

By BERNICE, RIVLIN

“Candida” chalked up another hit for Pitt Players last night at
8:30 in the Stephen Foster auditorium.

The Players proved an apt match for the Shaw comedy in in-
terpretation as well as presentation. Anatalie ,Gefsky in the title
role was in complete command of her part giving it the right touch
of ﬂippant, yet understanding femininity.

_ A
Her poised unrestrained per-'

formance was in sharp contrast to
the precocious teenager she re-
cently played in “The Philadel-
phia Story.” Miss Gefsky shows
excellent versatility as an actress.

Versatility of performance em-
bodied" the whole Players’ cast for
“Candida.” Fagan Beattie, as
Morell, gave real feeling to his
roll of the jealous, self-assured
husband. Along thesesame lines,
Robert Sisler, although only an
advanced freshmen, mastered one

of the most, difficult rolls the

istically infatuated poet.

and wit. Ruth also is in sharp
contrast to her emotional role in
“The Flies.”

The Cock-ney and reﬁned British

4 accents which the cast had to mas-

ter came off well. Due no doubt to
the strict construction of Shaw’s

. play, the tone of the first act was a

little too well modulated. The cast
warmed to their parts in the re-
maining two acts, however and
the production gained in volume
and suspense. —

Authenticity increased with the
excellent Mid-Victorian living
room set designed by Buell White-
hill of the speech department and
constructed by Frank Petrilak and
his committee. The Western Penn-
sylvania Historical Society donat-
ed the greater part of the late
nineteenth century props which
along with the furniture are
valued at $2000.

Costumes, also obtained‘ from
the Historical Society and other
similar sources, added consider-
ably to the early London ‘atmo-
sphere. Nance Mechling, who took
care of costumes for “The Flies,”
was prop mistress.

Last night proved a light enter-
taining evening with the Players
offering a delightful serving of ro-
mance and philosophy spiced with
just the right amount of good
humor.

Following tonight’s perform-
ance, tlie Players will hold the us-
ual reception in the social room of
Stephen Foste-r for the entire
audience. The play will be given
tonight and tomorrow night at
8:30.

By ‘HERB CANTOR

The right bid in any situation is the bid. that will give the most
information to your partner, the least» to your opponents—the bid

,.that puts you or gets you into the contract_which will produce the

maximum score on the hand.’ Making the right bid, involves an
understanding of any previous bids and an evaluation of your own
hand in the light ‘of those bids. In other words, you can. guess what
your partner and your opponents have on the basis of the, bids they
have or have not made, you can see what is in your own hand,
and thus can decide more or less accurately, depending on your ex-
perience, what the potentialities of the hand are. Thepurpose of
any bidding technique or convention is to translate the knowledge,

, experience, and card sense of the expert into terms intelligible to

all of us who play bridge. The point count system for bidding, ‘as
developed by Charles Goren, makes it possible for even beginners

to bid a certain type of hand as:

well as it can be bid by experts.
This column is the ﬁrst of three.
explaining the system and will
concern itself only with a gen-

Mr. Goren uses the Work count
as a basis for evaluation, dividing
the deck_ into forty points—four
for each ace, three for each king,
two for each queen, and one for
jack. With the following
hand (containing 37 points):

s AKQ h AKQ d AKQ c AKQJ.
seven no trump is" a cinch. That is,
you can take 13 tricks. About how

rmany points then are necessary

for one trick? My grade school
arithmetic suggests that 37 divid-
ed-by 13 is a little less than three
points per trick. If I can ﬁnd out
how many points my partner has,
I- can add them tothe number in
my hand, divide by three; and
presto, I know how many tricks

L we can take at no trump contract,

This -applies only ttishands that I
wish to play at no trump—hands
that are rather evenly distributed
and in’ which every suit is stop-

’ .ped._ Any hand that does not con-

 

.tain a void, singleton, or two dou-

bletons is evenly distributed,. any
suit in which you hold as much as
Jxx or .Kx may be considered
stopped unless it has been bid by
tliie opponents.

The opening bidder in any sys-
tem assumes that his partner has
a little strength, therefore the re-
quirements for an opening one no
trump bid are the distributions
discussedabove and 16-19 points
instead of the twenty—one need-
ed to make one no trump. How do
I arrive at twenty-one? Remem-
ber we need three points per trick
and We want to take seven tricks
—simple enough? And it’s just as
simple for responses to a one no
trump opening. Just add the

points in your hand to the mini-

mum of 16 announced by opener,
divide by three and make the bid
that indicates how many tricks

you think can bc made if your

partner has only a minimum.‘ For
instance, with 8 points bid 2 no
trump since 16 plus 8 is'24 divid-
ed by 3 is eight tricks you can ex-
pect to -take. And with 10 points

‘bid 3 no trump. The responder

is not responsible for stoppers but
he should also ‘have ‘a balanced
hand (i. e. a hand distributed
4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, 5-3-3-2)
raise the no trump bid. If the
opening bidder has 18 points in-
stead of 16, he should raise a re-
sponse of 2.no trump to three; but
he, must pass a three no trump re-
sponse since that is. game and a
slam. is very improbable.

Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

Well, the beer issue’s dead and
the guy named Ryan who was
promoting the stein has a right to
hang his head. It is thinking like
this which has made America
what it is today, thesubject for
the Kinsey report. He had about
as much chance as belly-button
lint in a Windstorm, of getting that
proposal through_ Congress and
faculty row. Nothing much except
noise resulted from the pub plan
but it could have had far reach-
ing, disastrous results. For in-
stance. it could have been tougher
than midnight on Cinderella for
the 18, 19, and 20 year—olds.

In the ﬁrst place it was a fore-
gone conclusion that there would
be no drinks, past, present or fu-
ture at a University to—do. “Car-
negie Tech has it,” you might say.
But I’d rather be Rasputin with
the mumps than like Carnegie

Tech. You can quote, vote and ‘

note me on that one because Tech
is my idea of what not to do, how
not to do it andwith whom not
to be seen. ,,

‘other things, mothers don’t raise

they send Junior to the hallowed
halls of ye olde university to get

it on ye olde universityis walls.
When mothers hear the cheer, for
beer they get _up in arms. Moth-
ers belong to church groups;

Mothers up in arms means-pas—,

tors and parsons up _in— arms.

‘Of course, all these people up
in arms have now been assured
that the crisis has 'been_ averted’,
but let us hope that the ‘crusaders
of virtue will let it go‘ at that.
But usually they begin to think

        - c cl

o Over-Capacity   row

' ‘Thanks to Stuart Chase, author of “The Proper Study of Man-
ind','_’7. many Pitt students have an inside, story on the reasons for
;1,e’fa_il'u,re of polls in the recent presidential election. ’

'Mr. Chase, addressing a capacity crowd’ in'Stephen Foster Me-
dorial" auditorium Wednesday afternoon, cited the errors of the

olls as a study in the general ﬁeld ‘of social science. “Mr. ‘Roper
; my neighbor, and we went over" this together,” -he said.

 The‘Gallup, Roper, and Crosley
"olls had each produced a guess
tatowas within the limitsof ac_-
iracy allowed by the sampling
-teory, Chase explained. , .
,A“, method of getting averages
‘Lithin percentages of a group, the
mpling theory has been revolu-
_ nizing census taking and statis-
‘ps. By simply assuming the
le1‘a'"ges of a large percentage to
tld true in general, the social
gientist car_i_us_ual1y arrive at‘ con-'
usioris that are accurate within

lsmall tolerance.

lBut,‘asjl\_/Ir. Chase made clear, "a
residential election is not a ﬁt
tbjectfor this type -of poll, espe-
'alIyTone like the last in which
f_\'"I',l_'laI_'lY _people were , undecided
1t_il- the _last minute. Mr. Chase
lmiited‘. tliat‘he could not decide
t a*candidate until election day.
The social ‘scientist can be ex-
‘  this _case ‘because thelit-'

a

 

have been successful in past elec-~

tions due totthe fact that a great

‘majority of. the people ‘had deﬁ-

nitely, decided which way they

would vote before election time. '

Some of the work done ‘social
scientists was discussed by Mr.
Chase? An important example he
gave was the devising of aptitude
tests- for pilots in’ World War 1-1.

A pilotuin the ‘ﬁrst World War was

usually selected for courage alone

‘which resulted insome cases of

square pegs in round holes. -The
‘requirements set up by aptitude

tests doubtless saved many lives

and helped to shorten the war,
Chase "stated. ‘

‘.He7 also explained the work of
teams of social and natural scien-
tists during the war. These teams

degrees who lost all their records
and equipment in theiﬁre. Much
of his equipment has had to be re-
built and of coyrse, a lot of time
has been lost through ‘retracing
his steps.

Dr. James Coull, Chem, Engi-
neering, took great pride in point-
ing out a molecular_ distillation
still which is one of the few in

‘ the country and quite expensive.

There ‘is also a conventional cop-

these stillslis that they all have
to be registered at Harisburg be-
cause of the possibility of making

would stoop to that!

Grady’s hopes for an improve-

the New ran
Fad: Upsets

By DONALD GIFFEN
Sports Editor V

VVith_out l1anging up outstanding records,’ Pitt’s athletic
outﬁts have deveolped this year a clever habit of leaving a

sweet taste in their followers’

mouths.

Mike Mill.igan’s crew appeared headed for nothing more

-than a mediocre season last fall, as it headed into its ﬁnal

games with Purdue and Penn State. But the Panthers left
pleasant memories by outﬁghting a desperate Boilermaker

eleven, then burying the bow1(>

hopes of the unbeaten Nittany
gridders.
They’l1 Remember WVU _

‘Similarly, the surprise party Dr.
H, C. Carlson’s basketball Caravan
held at.Morgantown last Saturday
as a windup will be remembered
by Pitt ﬂoor adherents long after
the not—so—pleasant record of 12-
13 is forgotten. _

Merely because the Pitts ﬁgure’-
eighted out of existence West Vir-
ginia’s 58-game home victory skein

- satisﬁes many of their rooters that

the basketball campaign was a
winning one, even though it didn’t
erase from the record book‘ the
13 defeats.

If the Caravan ‘had been re-_

stricted to tri-state travel,‘ as -the
short-staffed ’49-’50 club may be,
it would have had a ﬁne chart to
brag about. Carlson’s men of the
road lost all but two of their de-
feats while shutling through the
South and West. .
Doc’s Still Rehashing

And,'if Doc could lay his hands
on the ledger, he’d be tempted to
rewrite a few of the outcomes of

o the road games.

He’s still rehashing the last "nine
minutes of the Bradley game.

A recording of, the broadcast of
that clash, now the possession of
the University’s speech depart-
ment, v.eriﬁes that the Panthers
lost the ball twelve times during
that‘ span, either on personals or
out-of-bounds calls, to Bradley’s
three. Hence, his dogma against
many oﬁicials.

‘Disaster’

Penn State at State College,
Denver, Loyola. His club could
have won those, too, Doc contends.

But no matter how you look
back at the hoop season, you’re
,bound to end up at the Moun-
taineer upset, labeled by a West
Virginia paper Sunday, “DISAS-
TER.” '

.That’s where Dodo Canterna
will dwell in years to come, not
on the night back in 1944, when
he scored 37 points against West-
‘minster, a Pitt record. .

‘Most Satisfaction’

“It was the most satisfaction I
ever got out of a game,” Dodo re-
marked happily on the bus home
from Morgantown. “There it was
—-my'1ast game. We upset a team

that’s won 58 straight. You can’t
ask for anything better.”..

What with the long-range out-
look for next year rather drab, it
appears we can’t expect anything
to match it, at least for another
season or two‘. ’*
We can hardly expect the cagers
to lose two men like the sensa-
tional Canterna and a not-so-sen-
sational but even-more-brilliant
Sammy David, and still come up
with such a beautifully worked
out axing of high-ﬂying teams
like West Virginia.

of Pitt football, where he never
got going under the single wing
as he did under Clark Shaugh-
nessy’s Panther T of 1944, will go

Paul’s high school coach predicts.
“They certainly aren’t keeping
Paul on the payroll just to have

Who Tells Scribe, 'Write About Boys

 

Mitterlingi r

V By LYNN C. MITCHELL

“The boys, the boys. Write about the boys.”

Ralph (Sarge) Mitterling just didn’t believe he was as inter-
esting news as his “boys.” In fact he had to be pursued for several
hours around the Stadium bullpen Monday and cornered ﬁnally in
the shower room before admitting in the most modest way that he
had been a big leaguer with the Athletics in 1916 and a veteran
of the minor leagues. ‘

Between questions

V’

about himself, that is.

But for the same reason the
easy-going and gentlemanly Pitt
baseball coach has always been
known as a_good guy. '

‘48 Was Let-Down.

It must be said, however, that
the _Mitterling—minded mittmen
are eagerly looking forward to a
winning season this year. The
1948 baseball edition was a dis-
appointment to Mitterling even
though last year’s team was com-
posed highly‘ of regulars from
1947, a winning season for the
Sarge.

The likable coach goes about
his job as head mentor in the same
rugged way of the past, using —a
bat for bunting demonstrations or
even heaving himself into the
sliding pit as an example -for the
boys .-who don’t keep -their shoul-
