  Disparate Views On Dorm Aired
Administration Tries

To

Quelli Controversy

by BILL GORMLEY, News Editor

Conceding that the Universitys plans to construct a new dorm
complex in the vicinity of the Veterans Hospital "have perhaps been in-
adequately communicated to some people." Jack Freeman. executive
assistant to the chancellor. attempted Wednesday to nip a controversy

based on "misinformation" in the bud.

Freeman and other administration spokesmen emphasized. in sep-
arate interviews. that the Universitys need for additional dorm space
is critical and that studentsparticipated actively in the decision-mak-
ing process which yielded a housing plan over a year ago.

The University is expected to begin constructing a dormitory to _
house 1.300 students early next year. It will be built on a piece of land
bounded by Trees Hall on the west. Falk School on the east, Alequippa
Street on the north. and University Drive on the south.

Provisions have been made to increase the size of one of two play-
grounds next to Falk School and build a new one to replace the play-
ground which will be supplanted by the dorm.

A pamphlet distributed by students opposed to the University's de-
cision. which was reached over two years ago, neglects to mention that
while one playground will be demolished to make way for the dorm. an- .

other will be built in its place.

"The total playground area is just in excess of 30,000 square feet as
it now exists”. Hunt Martin. director of the Physical Plant. explained.
“The total amount of playground available to the Falk School under the
proposed plan would be approximately 27,000 feet."

Answering an additional objection to the Hillside Dormitories,
Martin pointed out that such recreational facilities as Trees Hall, Fitz-
gerald Field House and Pitt Stadium will be especially accessible to
students living in the new dorms. He added that “by the time the dorm
is complete (the current estimate is-the fall of 1973), the escalator com-
plex should be nearly complete too,” making access to the heart of the

campus relatively easy.

In the above-mentioned pam'phlet. no reference is made to the es-
calator which will run from O‘Hara Street to the Hillside Dormitories,
and the South Oakland shopping area is termed "a long and steep walk

or drive away“ from the dorm.

Responding to another point of criticism. Freeman stressed the
role which students played since the fall of 1968 in reaching decisions on
the dorm. “There isn't a project that's ever been planned at this Uni-
versity that's had more student input." he claimed.

Community Reacts To Proposed Dorms

Residents See Threat

by BOB GING, News Editor

University. plans to construct a hillside dormitory project in the stadium area have caused a great
deal of furor among the residents of the adjacent Allequippa Street community, and other residents who
would be affected by the construction of these dorms.

A hastily formed group of students and community residents is attempting to find some type of a sol-
ution to many of the problems which will be created by the construction of the dorms. The residents of this
community only recently became aware of the construction plans according to Keith Bromberg.

Bromberg. a member and spokesman for the Student-Community Coalition. explained that the group
was formed to find out exactly what the dorm plans were and how they would affect the community. “We
have found out that plans were in the making for at least three years.” he explained. “but only last week, at
a meeting of the Falk School PTA, were the plans made available to the community.

Bromberg, a Pitt student himself, explained some of the reasons for the community dissatisfaction
with the proposed dorms. “First, Allequippa Street, which runs off Centre, is the only access the residents
have to their homes and it is already badly congested.” He pointed out that the current use of that street by
the Fall School, VA Hospital, Trees Hall, Pitt Stadium, community residents, and residents of nearby Schen-
ley Farms and Schenley Heights have made parking impossible, created innumberable traffic problems, and
pose a threat to the safety of the children of the community.

“In the winter." Bromberg said. “Allequippa Street is too icy to get a car up the hill. Residents now.
use University Drive and another connecting road to get to their homes. but the connecting road will no

longer exist once the dorms are built.

"The problems which will arise out of this are obvious. and are cause for a great deal of concern. Pre-
sently. fire trucks have a very difficult time getting to the community and to the VA Hospital. With the added
congestion caused by the dormitories. what is now intolerable will become impossible."

Another complaint put forth by the residents of the community concerns a ballfield, adjacent to Falk
School, which is used by their children. “These kids use the ballfield every night,” Bromberg commented,
“and the lot proposed by the University, although comparable in square footage, will be impossible to play
ball in because of its shape. There is currently a house on the lot where-the new ballfield will be developed
and the University plans to raze this house and cut all of the trees around the house for the new field.”

In addition to the physical problems there are also human problems which could arise from the addi- , M
tion of 1,300 students to that community. “The community." asserts Bromberg, “feels that the congested
situation will cause many of the same problems that the Towers Dormitories cause in South Oakland.

_ “To begin with." he went on. “there are at present no commercial facilities nearby. The residents are
worried that the neighborhood will become a playground for the dormitory occupants."

New SC Constitution Proposed

by CINDY MORGAN

Concrete steps have finally
been taken to officially restruc-
ture Student Government. The
new constitution, ratified by the

Coalition Aids Co-eds

by MARC HILLER
and LENNY KLAVONIC

A new coalition of concerned or-
ganizations and individuals has
been created to deal with the sit-
uation of unwanted pregnancies
at the University. Throughout the
summer months efforts ‘have been
made by Environmental Action-
Zero Population Growth. Student
Government. University and City
Ministries, University YWCA.
Planned Parenthood Center of
Pittsburgh. and the Student Health
Service to attack the problem
from the standpoint of the individ-
ual ‘who ha-s made the decision to
terminate pregnancy. instead of
approaching it from the religious
or moral perspective.

One major reason to join in 'a
co-ordinated effort in this area
was the fact that many University
co-eds were unaware of existing
services and were forced. in many
cases. to seek help outside the
University community. an action
which often resulted in treatment
by unqualified or otherwise un-
skilled individuals claiming ade-
quate competency in performing
the operation.

Examining the problem from a
preventive perspective. Student
Government recently distributed
5.000 copies of the Birth Control
Handbook, a publication of the

‘ Students Society of McGill Uni-

versity- Continuous referral has
been offered throughout the sum-

 

mer by Environmental Action-
Zero Population Growth who re-
ferred people to the Planned Par-
enthood Center for treatment and

I distribution of birth control de-

vices.

Beginning Oct. l, co-ordinated
efforts will begin on the part of all
organizations concerned to pre-
sent the broadest possible medi-
cal referral, counseling, and fi-
nancial assistance. In the very
near future, the Student Health
Service Organization of Student
Government will be instituting a
program for the distribution of
condoms at manufacturer's cost
to any individual in the University
community desiring the service.
The distribution would be handled
by the Student Health Service, lo-
cated in Brackenridge Hall.

The Student Health Service cur-
rently provides limited free gyne-
cological services and assistance
to any student requesting consul-
tation. Although the Student
Health Services capacity to as-
sist in these matters has been in-
creased. the combined efforts of
concerned organizations will ex-
pand the services and facilities in
the areas of birth control and
abortion.

Information concerning prob-
lem pregnancies. abortion. and
population control can be obtained
by contacting Environmental Ac-
tion—Zero. Population Growth 414

will be handled by the Student
Government Office. 1305 Student
Union. ext. 7330. 7328. or 6555.
However. emergency help may be
received by directly contacting
the emergency clinic at Magee-
Women‘s Hospital at Forbes and
Halket Sts.. at 681-5700.

To help the student involved in
the unwanted pregnancy combat
the emotional trauma which of-
ten precedes or follows the prob-
lem, Student Government will
also arrange counseling through
Clergy-Consultation, a recently
formed organization interested in
dealing with the individual’s reac-
tions and feelings on a strictly
personal and confidentiallevel.

To further insure that once the
therapeutic abortion has been ar-
ranged through qualified medical
personnel and proper consulta-
tion. the individual does not fore-
go help because of financial rea-
sons and turn to the unlicensed
practitioner. financial arrange-
ments on a partial loan basis can
be arranged through the Student
Government Office. All cases will
be. treated in a strictly confiden-
tial manner.

Efforts will be undertaken on
the part of the Student Govern-
ment Health Service Organization
and Environmental Action—Zero

the distribution of birth control
pills at a later.date.

necessary two—thirds majority of
senators Tuesday night. combines
ideas from several other commit-
tees which have come and gone in
the past year and those of the ad-
ministration.

According to the present SG
constitution. any new amendment
or constitution must not only se-
cure a Senate majority. but it
must also be submitted to the stu-
dent body and receive the support
of over one-half of those voting.

The referendum will be in ear-
ly November, and before that the
SG. headed by President Lenny
Klavonic, will educate students
at their dormitories, fraternity
houses. and through the Pitt News
concerning the probable benefits
of the proposed new system. It is
believed that the new restructur-
ing will result in a Student Gov-

The .l970 Activities Fair
will be held Monday and Tues-
day from T0 a.m. through 5
p.m. in the Student Union Ball-
room. The obiective of this
year's Fair is to promote stu-
dent involvement in campus
organizations.

Students will have the
chance to meet with represen-
tatives from various campus
organizations and register for
any which interest them. En-
tertainment will be provided
in addition to the activities

iunctively by the Men's Coun-

ernment that is of more service
to the students, as both a co-ordi-

.nator in students affairs, and in

solving many of the academic and
social problems of the student.

Presently, there are no sena-
torial meetings except to discuss
various policies. And if the stu-
dents pass the new constitution in
November, there will be no furth-
er senatorial decisions except for
a few possible ones regarding al-
locations or appointments. There
will also be another electionin
January to elect new officials.

Perhaps the most noticeable
change within the new system will
be the division of duties among
four executives
president. The Executive will be
comprised of four separately
elected commissioners responsi-
ble for four areas of student con-
cern: academic (the academic
cabinets and course evaluation),
social (the social calendar, stu-
dent organizations, and entertain-
ment). programming ' (orienta-
tion. minority group programs,
and all special programming for
organizations), and lastly, com-
mittees (committee applications,
student services. public relations,
research. and finance).

With these changes, approxi-
mately 28 student representa-
tives will be elected to the Uni-

instead of one “ "

versity Senate Council. The exact A 

day for this election will be de-
termined by out-going representa-
tives. The students who are elect-
_ed must appoint students to fill all
available positions on the commit-
tees and seats in the Senate within
three weeks of assuming office.
The election itself will be admin-
istered by seven graduating sen-
iors. appointed by out-going rep-
presentatives.

In the Towers, each house will

Cormick Hall residents defend-

Freeman and Martin attribute
the concern of the former to “un-
founded fears" that the Universi-
ty might stop financing the Falk
School.

The Falk School. which is own-
ed and operated by the Universi-
ty, serves as an educational lab-
oratory to the School of Educa-
tion and includes students from a
wide variety of socioleconomic
backgrounds.

At a meeting Tuesday night, the

University’s intentions until last

2. We. the residents of our build-

under the impression that we
would have 24-hour visitation,
and therefore we are prepared
to handle the situation.

3. We feel that since we are a

such. that 24-hour visitation is

and extending this visitation to
our guests is not a great change
from what already exists.

ground facilities. termed "too
costly" by the administration.
The revised suggestion is. accord-
ing to Martin, "subject to ne-
gotiation. ”

Mrs. Margaret Haynes, chair-
man of the Community-Student
Coalition, just learned about the
new dorm two weeks ago. “We
should have had some kind of
warning,“ she complained.

If her views are typical, hillside
residents are asking the following
questions: What kind of parking
problems and transportation dif-
ficulties will the construction of
the Hillside Dormitories cause?
Will student culture have an ad-
verse effect on neighborhood
children? Might the University
eventually decide to purchase
land used currently for residen-
tial purposes?

According to Freeman and
Martin, the last question is main-
ly on their minds. “I think they‘re
afraid the University has expan-
sion eyes on the neighborhood,”
Martin observed. “But the Uni-
versity has no interest in their
property.

Student Political
Involvement Sought

A conference on Politics will be held at Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity tomorrow from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Speakers will address
themselves particularly to effective campaign techniques and possi-

bilities for student involvement.

In addition to the formal program, candidates for local, state,
and federal office or their representatives will be available from

He stressed that this fear is not
based on a dislike for students but
on the belief that students in dor-
mitories never really become part
of a residential community.

After a great many attempts to
bring the University to some type
of communications with the com-
munity, the Student-Community
Coalition finally met with Univer-
sity representatives last Wednes-
day. “Although Pitt's public re-
lations men didn’t answer any of
the important questions." Brom-
berg said, “They did promise to
take the questions back to Pitt and
attempt to find the answers.f‘

If this attempt to find a solu-
tion does not meet community ex-
pectations, Bromberg aserted
that the community will take the
petitions it is now circulating to
government authorities. “We
hope that we won’t have to use the
petition," Bromberg explained.
“But in the event that the Univer-
sity is unresponsive. we will use
them and mobilize student sup-
port for our dilemma."

Karate For Women

  . For Self Defense

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
l Associate Editor

One of the most successful forums of the Symposium on Femin-
ism held here Wednesday and Thursday of this week dealt with the
issue of self-defense for women.

Public events have almost erased the need for a justification
for female acquisition of defense skills. Women are assaulted, mur-
dered, raped or in other ways, violated every day. Newspapers and
pther “night-oriented” fields sometimes close out women on the

" basis of potential physical dangers.

Most individual women have experienced personal harrassment
. on the streets; the Boston strangler is one of our nations most in-
famous celebrities.

However, one of the most interesting and insightful points made

by two representatives of a Boston Female Liberation Karate team

I was the connection between sex crimes and a politico-socio strains
- of the country.

The obvious fact that women are always the objects of sexual
assaults, believed the speakers, is an indication of the intensity of
the sexism that “pervades our society.”

RLEASE ’
Men have been taught that sexual release is a “valid" method of
r exercising frustrations and “masculine” aggressive tendencies.
” They learn that overpowering and dominating a member of the
“weaker sex” is a reinforcement of sagging virility.

Delpfine Welch and Pat Galligan, two skilled women in the
Korean art of Tae Kwon Do—the original Karate—-offered a second
conclusion which to this writer was a brilliant insight.

_ . The women pointed out that in many cases of fatal assault, the
bodies of the victims are mutilated, cut into pieces and otherwise
dissected in a sexual way.

They reached the conclusion that this results from the manner
in which women are portrayed in the media and the popular maga-
zines. The female form is commonly presented in bits and pieces——
a pair of legs is inserted in an automobile advertisement—contem-
porary fashions are sporting the “cut out" look, a look that empha-
sizes a breast for a midrif. This sexist trend, they felt, educates sex-
ual marauders to see women as parts of a whole. The conclusion is
* 1 « that a demented culture produces demented attackers.

SELF-PROTECTION
Besides the apparent physical necessity for women to realize
the ability to protect themselves, the karate artists pinpointed psy-
chological advantages. Mere knowledge that she can handle herself
defensively may prompt a woman to react strongly to verbal as-
saults as well as physical threats. -

It is no uncommon sensation for a lone women to experience in-
tense feelings of fear while walking past the Briar Bowl on Forbes
Ave. There is always the though lurking in the back of her mind that
if she dares to stand up for herself to combat with a verbal retort,
sexist pinches or threats thereof, she will be immediately mangled
or perhaps just intimidated.

But just intimidated is too intimidated for the new woman. The
new woman who is demanding, without “permission,“ control over
her own body and how it will be used. And that's the trend. The wom-
an is beginning to see the need to use her body, instead of accepting
outside definitions of how it should be used. _

Students Give Conservative Victory

Weiriglrtss and Joy

by WILLIAM A. JOHNSTON, III

Probably the only statement
that could not judiciously be
challenged in the debate between
conservative Daniel Joy and ex-
treme left winger Leonard Wein-
glass is that the audience be-
have as if they were witnessing
the NFL’s annual Super bowl
football game. It was not hard to
determine who was the home
team. After it is not too prudent
for the supporters of the visiting
team to be discourtious to the
home town crowd at their pre-
sence. However, the manner in
which Mr. Weinglass’ most vo-
cal supporters behaved con-
firmed many of Mr. Joy’s con-
tentions, consequently providing
him with a victory, whether he

‘I realized it or not.

The principa, approach of the
two debaters expounded upon
were somewhat different. Mr.
Joy’s contentions were .funda-
mentally philosophical and Mr.
Weinglass’ exclusively empiri-
cal. Mr. Joy endeavored to set a
parallel of the contemporary
American New Left to that of the
French syndicalists and the
youth of the pre-Hitler age. Joy
went on to say that “Syndicalism
is the founding of New Left
thinking."

He also performed his most
devastating undermining of the
New Left by challenging the
views of one of the New Left's
foremost spokesman, John Da-
vidson.‘ Joy stated that David-

son says, “Stop the universities
from functioning. The university
is the most oppressive part of
the establishment.” Joy also
stated that Davidson refers to a
New Working Class. “He made
up a new working class because
the old one didn’t work.” Joy
went on to say about the reasons
behind campus unrest that “it
can’t be Vietnam because the
same things are going on in Bri-
tain, France, and Germany.”

ON THE other hand Mr. Wein-
glass debated on points that in-
volved him and the others in
“The Movement.” For example
he told about an FBI agent who
testified against the Chicago
Eight in the Conspiracy Trial

and admitted that he and a few

others had attempted to inter-
dict former Vice-President
Humphrey from speaking at the
convention. Weinglass expound-
ed that one of the jurors said,
“After hearing men like Mr.
Salaburg, for the first time I am
afraid of my government.”

“The question is not how vio-
lent we’ve become. The question
is how passive we’ve become in
the face of an overwhelming gov-
ernment. We have to stop wring-
ing our hands and starting some
arms. We should bring down the
system by whatever means ne-
cessary.” After those closing

' statements the New Left version

of the Mouseketeers gave him a
standing ovation.

MR. JOY in his rebuttal said,
“Our people have lost more

Analyzed

times than we’ve won in the past
ten years, but we did not go with
guns into the streets.” Joy de-
clares that the Young Ameri-
icans for Freedom were “an an-
ti-liberal establishment group”
and he attempted to defend the
principles of the constitution and
freedom. Many times he found
himself attempting to defend the
status quo, which he does not
support, against the radical al-
ternatives.

Mr. Weinglass on the other
hand endeavored to put Jerry
Rubin and Abbie Hoffman in the
same class with George Wash-
ington and Thomas Jefferson. In
one respect I agree. Washington
and Jefferson owned plantation
slaves and Rubin and Hoffman
want socialist slaves. Whom can
you trust anymore?

Joy suggested that all of the
empirical observations of Wein-
glass should be taken with a
grain of salt. If you disregard
the philosophical arguments of
Joy and disregard the empirical
arguments of Weinglass, since
no one else was there to confirm
his candor, you come up with one
startling revelation which is ex-
clusively empirical. If you ob-
serve the behavior of the sup-
porters of Mr. Joy and the be-
havior of the vocal supporters of
the New Left, in addition to the
way that Mr. Weinglass respond-
ed to a question, you will arrive
at one conclusion. The New Left
does not believe in free speech.
How about that, Mouseketeers?

  Revelations (in Revolution

by IAN IIEISS

I never liked the idea of violent revolution as
a means of social reform. Largely, my feelings on
revolt are subjective, and because I write this arti-
cle to persuade I wish to separate out those things
which may not relate to radicals who have already
committed themselves to overthrowing the sys-
tem.

I believd in the Judeao-Christian-Islamic myth
that to commit murder is a wrong thing. Although
I could see fighting to defend myself or my home-
land (a nebulous area which includes Pittsburgh
but not Saigon) I could not see myself murdering
or assassinating to carry through a revolution at
home.

I realize, however, that a true revolutionary_

has steeled himself to do all that is necessary for
a violent change of government and will be unaf-
fected by my arguments of “religious bullshit.”

I BELIEVE IN the liberal myth of social re-
form through political pressure channels. That
muchhas been done towards reforming social ills,
and there is much left to be done. I am convinced
that the process of renewing our inner cities 
a process of decades, not election years. I unm -
stant that the priorities in this country are in:
torted, but I feel that they can only be changed by
steady political pressure.

R I realize that the revolutionary holds little or
no stock in the possible avenues oft political re-
form, but seeks a military solution. I am aware of
that and do not pose this as an argument to dis-
suade him. ‘

History shows that the most successful revolu-
tions are those with close knit elites and broad
based support among the people. While the New
Left is intellectually heterogenius. and its sup-
porters tend to make better sympathizers than
warriors, it is not to me to predict histroy. Cer-
tainly a dedicated revolutionary concerns himself
with what is to be to a much greater extend than
what was.

REVOLUTION SEEMS wrong to me because
those who undertake to revolt consider their ideals
about life styles more important them peoples
lives. Yet I realize that a‘ true revolutionary is
convinced that his ideals are more importantthan
peoples lives (especially some peoples lives) and
I would not attempt to convince a revolutionary
with such an argument.

Revolution in America seems especially lu-
cridious to me because the revolutionaries num-
ber -in the thousands while the members of the war
machine number in the millions. It seems to be
that revolutionaries would be crushed over a brief
period of time, and the social coffins of the under-

. priviledged that they champion would be sealed
. under the hand of a repressive military I

Yet a true revolutionary does not fear larger
numbers. He does not necessarily fear a wave of
repression. He feels that revolution in America is
only part of a great wave of worldwide revolution
which will eventually come to reinforce the Amer-
ican left. He is certain the conflict will be bloody

‘ and can accept the fact that the lives of millions of

innocents will be ended or distorted towards his
ends. So indeed, I cannot use any of these argu-
ments to sway a true revolutionary.

N0, AS I consider each of these arguments I
can see why and how they sway me to be a liberal.
but not how they will change the minds of those I
consider to be revolutionaries.

Now there may be many of you who want to

seize me by the shirtscruff and say. “Now look

here, you’re' wrong in the way you define a revolu-
tionary.” Before making the assumption that I am
wrong in my definition. search yourself to see if
the root of your anger is the naming, in my list, of
a revolutionary quality which you do not possess.
That is, if you feel yourself religious. but willing
to revolt. or if you lecl political solutions are pos-
sible but ll cl i. r : ight to burn, or if you think peo-
ple are mu 1 we -»z ; z‘l.é-Ll than ideas. but still want
to bump gr-ti .“_,,» <.- .‘.;_ncw. or if you think that some
sort of ll()Il\'inl' m revolution will take place with-
out a confrontation with the military, or if you
think you can be a revolutionary without risking
the spattering of your guts, you’d best think again.
It is likely you are not prepared to make the com-
mitment of the revolutionary.

Now there may be a few of you who read
through this article without disagreement, and
agree wholeheartedly with my assumptions about
revolutions. That is, to revolt successfully you
have to come out of your religious hangups and-hu-
manistic bullshit. That you have to be prepared to
fight even a losing cause rather than compromise
your ideals.

LETS ASSUME THAT you hack your way to
the top. That you seize the reins of America, or
enough of them to merit help from brother revol-
tionaries across the seas . . .

. . . You will find, rushing to your aid, third gen-
eration Russian Commisars, intellectually stunt-
ed and completely power oriented. . . . Aging Chi-
nese, ruling in the finest Mandrin tradition, over
peasants who equate communism with Buddist
theology. . . . Scores of nations with ruling com-
munist, who have a longer path to social reform
than the America of the 1950s. . . .

And it would be you, the revolutionaries, the
men without compromise, who would be forced to
make the cruelest compromises of all, you the

idealists, who_would suffer this,idealis_t’s existen-

pa-ma‘

How Our Readers See It

Monotonous

To the Editor, The Pitt News:

It appears that Mr. (Mark) Co-
hen’s drivel is to be forced on us
with monotonous regularity (ie.
in each issue of The Pitt News, in-
tellectually void through it is. As
Mr. Donatelli’s articles are comb-
ed with great scrutiny for “incon-
sistencies,” it seems only fitting
that Cohen should be required to

~ offer something beyond frantic
calls to take up the workingman‘s
burden and quit playing frisbie
on the Cathedral lawn.

Though his rhetoric is wittingly
interpressed with “color,” it is
still a ponderous undertaking to
achieve any rhyme or reason
from his rather shallow diatribes.
With usual arrogance for such a
childish mentality, he screams
(extrapolated from previous writ-
ings) Stop! Revolt! Rip! Tear!
Shred! Destroy! that which has
been built.

Our privileged position (which
of course is derived from the sur-
plus our system provides) should

I ‘e utilized more constructivelv. I

think perhaps there is some worth
in that statement so we’ll allow it
to pass uncontested.

But Mr. Cohen loves to promis-
cuously wave his finger (which
should “home in" on his own ridi-
culous self) and spew forth stup-
id generalities and half-truths.

He brilliantly levels the busi-
ness community with “it is good
business, just like war.” I think
that if Mr. Cohen really cared, he
should check with the Establish-
ment to see how much they like
the war. Maybe then, he would
find out how much of the economy
isn't profiting from the war.

Maybe he would find how great
a majority of business is crying
to invest and build and supply our
society with the goods and serv-
ices of a _peacetime economy.
Perhaps, he should look at the fi-
nancial page more often. The
NYSE and AMEX listings have
fallen so critically in the past two
years that many feel the market
is in depression right now. And
these are the “fat cats.“ Mr. Co-
hen. I just cannot visualize them
salivating over events in South-
east Asia.

As an answer to our dilemmas,
Mr. Cohen suggests that we quit

such a sinister remark that we

me, one of the major redeeming
features of the system we have is
our right to at least a degree of in-

This is an easy question to an-

search in the electoral processes

. information on electoral pro-
cesses" (emphasis added). Or, to
paraphrase, “Keep the coins roll-

those dirty leftists here." Can you
believe that this pale, diluted
CIC is a response to Kent State
and Cambodia?

Posvar lauds Pitt’s “atmos-
phere of free thought and free
speech” (The Pitt News, Sept. 18)
while capitulating to Harrisburg’s
rumblings on the right by helping
to evict the free thinking and the

college field generals. Pitt head Coach Carl De-
Pasqua has announced that Hogan will be his
starting quarterback tomorrow, but quickly added
that, “both boys will play.”

Dave Havern. 5‘9" junior from Montour High
School near McKees Rocks will be backing up
Hogan.

In regard to the affect of Ralph Cindrich's
injury on the defensive strategy Coach DePas-
qua said, “There will be no significant changes
in the defense. The linebackers will just move
up," refering to Gary Patterson and George Fe-
her, both of whom filled for Cindrich in the
UCLA game. ' if

 

Panthers On T. V.

Panther fans will have the opportunity to
see the Cats battling the Baylor Bears live from
Waco, Texas over WTAE-TV (Channel 4). WTAE
radio (1250) will also beam the game back over
a 15-station network.


Pasqua said about Cindrich, “and with the design
of the defense, it’s gonna hurt.”

Other than the ailing second-year middle line-
backer, Pitt goes to Waco without any serious in-
juries. Linebacker Joe Carroll has been troubled
this week by a charley horse, but DePasqua is
confident that Carroll will be ready for Satur-
day’s game. Lloyd Weston has been suffering
with a low back injury and Ernie Webster has
a hip pointer, but both will be‘ready for the con-
test.

This weekend’s game is only the third meet-
ing between Pitt and Baylor._In 1961 the schools
began. relations and the Bears beat Pitt, 16-13. The
following year the Panthers evened things up
with a 24-14 victory. The two schools will not
meet again after Saturday’s game until 1973 when
the Bears visit Pitt Stadium for the season opener.

Baylor Coach Bill Beall got a taste of Eastern
football last week against Army and came out
on top. He indicated that he could not detect any
specific differences in the Eastern and Southern
styles of football. Praising the fine quality of
football across the country Coach Beall added
emphatically, “You can get beat anywhere.”

they will have quite the skill
that Akron did.”

The Akron match took a slight

_ injury toll, temporarily sidelining
Chu Cho Valencia. Valencia pull— ’

ed a calf muscle and injured his
knee on Saturday. He has missed
practice this week but Bemis
feels that he will be ready to
play in the up coming match.

Gus Theofilos was also hurt

Pitt quarterback John Hog-
an was selected by the East-
ern Collegiate Athletic Con-
ference as their Sophomore
of the Week, in leading the
star picks in the first week
of the Division 1 Star Squad
tappings.

Hogan completed 29 of 47
passing attempts for 299
yards in the Panther opening
loss to UCLA at Pitt Stad-
ium, top quarterback statistics
in the nation after the first
week.

Panther linebacker Joe
Carroll also received an honor

West Chester finished last sea-
son with a 10-4-1 record. They
were one of the four schools from
the Pennsylvania, Delaware, New
Jersey Selection Group to rep-
resent the district in the nation-
al tournaments.

This will be the Pitt booters’
first experience playing on As-
tro-Turf. Some of the booters
who practiced on the Turf report-
ed that the ball rolls much fas-
ter than on grass. Also the field
has an eighteen inch crown which
causes the ball to roll off of the

a field.

The soccer men play in short
pants and short sleeved shirts
and Bemis predicts some brush
burn injuries due ,to falling and

sliding ‘on the Turf.
Putting the soccer marking on
the AstroTurf also presents

problems. Tape will be used to
mark the penalty areas since any
other type of marking is either
impractical or will damage the
Turf, In the event of rain, how-
ever, the tape will not adhere to
the field.

expects to use his running game more this week against Baylor.

Stadium
Lines

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Panther football fans would have been surprised Wed-
nesday afternoon had they chosen to walk up to Pitt Sta-
dium to watch their favorite football team practice. They
would have, instead, discovered that Pitt does indeed hav.e
a soccer team.

Conveniently, the Panther football team will be played
at Baylor on real grass tomorrow and the Pitt soccer squad
is scheduled to play its first home game on the Stadiums
AstroTurf. So the teams switched practice fields for aiday
on (Wednesday, the gridders going to the All—Purpose
Fiel s.

The football team took over the Stadium on Thursday,

P but soccer coach Leo Bemis can finally claim the Stad-

ium turf as a home for his players. The permanent blue
soccer lines which extend from the grid sidelines have been
installed, and the turf looks like more than a football field.

It doesn’t look exactly like a soccer field, though.

The 18-yard lines which bound the penalty areas and
a midfield circle must be added.

Adhesive tape will be used for these temporary lines
whenever a soccer matchxis scheduled. The tape could be
a problem in rain or snow, losing its adhesiveness. Or in
any kind of weather, players could trip over the lines-
which are above the normal turf surface, of course.

The tape will also be white, the color of the perman-
ent football stripes. And that could be the biggest prob-
lem. ' ~

“Sure, that’ll make it a little confusing for us,” Bemis
admits. “But we can live with that. We’ve got a filed to
play on——that’s the big thing.”

Bemis would prefer the permanent blue lining for all
soccer needs, but possible confusion for football players
and fans rules out those markings.

‘‘If they're gonna call it a multi-purpose field, there’s
no reason the lines shouldn't be there,” Bemis says, referr-
ing to the permanent blue ones. “But of course you could
go on and on and say you should have the girls’ field hock-
ey lines. Then you would get a quilt appearance.”

Bemis is also Pitt’s Director of Intramurals and despite
that comment, he is satisfield that the AstroTurf is becom-
ing a multi-purpose field. Band practice, physical educa-
tion classes, and future intramural action on the turf sup-
ports such a belief.

Bemmis is planning intramural softball‘ and football
games on the Stadium’s free Saturdays and Sundays this
fall, beginning very soon.

“We could have games during the week now,” he says.
But it’s a little difficult during the football season, and
we’re losing daylight savings time. But when we get
lights...” .

L...~g..c..1. Squad
For First Win Today

'.

By MARTY HELLMAN

Whether the future of Pitt foot-
ball is a bright one or not, will
be answered in part by the out-
come of today's freshman grid-
iron contest at West Virginia.

The Cubs open their schedule
against the WVU frosh at 2 p.m.
this afternoon. Coach Bill Quin-
ter will have 43 freshmen to bat-
tle the Junior Mountaineers.

Among the 43 Cubs, will be 13
of last year's Pennsylvania‘s “Big
33" squad. Their prescence in the
[lineup along with many other
‘..}’ghly touted schoolboy players
gives Quinter one of the best po-
tential teams that Pitt has had
in recent seasons.

The big names in the Cub ros-
ter occupy backfield positions.
Quarterbacks for the opener will
be Bob Medwid and Rod Huth,
both local high school stars.

"I feel that we have four of
the best quarterbacks in the
East," Quinter remarked.

The other two field generals
are Bob Veillette and Dan Rullo.
Both will start in the defensive
backfield for this contest.

The rest of the offensive back-
field will be filled by Clair Wil-
son, Stan Ostrowski and John
Chatman.

Receivers for Medwids and
Huth's passes include Lance Wall.
Jim Stein. Grant Abe and Bill
Englert. Tight ends are Leslie
Block and Mark Butr_\'n.

Defensively. the Cubs look big
and strong up front. James Buck-
man. John Robb. John Achenbach
and Glenn Hyde present a defen-
sive wall that averages 220 pounds.

The WVU frosh will depend
heavily on its quickness to off-
set Pitt’s depth. Kerry Mar-

Camaro In Georgia

Race After Successful

Recruiting Program

By HARVEY MARCUS

This weekend. Bob Fryer and the University of Pittsburgh
Road Racing Team will be traveling to "the land of cotton" where
they hope to capture top honors in the Savanna Nationals being held
in Savanna. Georgia. Until a few days ago. the race was scheduled
to be held in Atlanta. Sports Car Club of America tSCCA) officials.

however. have decided to switch the action to the Savanna circuit I

and reschedule the Atlanta run
until next month.

The past week has been a busy
and profitable one for the Uni-
versity Team. The team’s spirits
have not only been buoyed by
improvements made on the sus-
pension and braking systems of
the Camaro. but also by the phe-
nomenal response to the organiza-
tions recruitment campaign. Ap-
plication forms for membership
have poured in to the Team's
headquarters at the rate of over
100 per week.

The overwhelming success to
date of the Road Racing Team's
membership drive did not seem
much of a surprise to Bob Led-
erman, a member of the student
“Pitt Crew".

“These race weekends are/tre-
mendous.“ explained Lederman.
"Not only is there the spectacle
and thrill of professional racing
itself. but the dusk to dawn so-
cial life which is something that
just has to be experienced. You
can easily understand why peo-
ple want to be a part of the
whole scene. "

The Pitt Camaro crew has
come quite a ways since its in-
ception last spring. when there
were only a handful of partici-
pants. A win this weekend would
be a gratifying return on the
generous investment of effort and
interest which has been shown.

son. As of now, Pika is credited
with the win. Delta Phi played the
game under protest.

Pika‘s Jack Hannon was the hit-
ting star of the game. His four hits
included two homers and two dou-
bles and six RBI's. Tom Bailey
who leads the league in walks,
also had two hits to go with his
walk. Joe Zuccerelli also had two
hits.

In the top of the seventh inning
time ran out with the score re-
verting back to the last complet-
ed inning. Delta Phi contended
that time had ran out in the sixth.
