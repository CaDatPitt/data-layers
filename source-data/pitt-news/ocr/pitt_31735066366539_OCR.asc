UNIVERSITY OI: PITTSBURGH

P.P.P., Engels Give Platforms;

Student Activities Fee Discussed

(The first in a ‘series of articles on the platforms of
Student Government candidates.)

The Pitt Progressive Party (P.P.P.) and
the Marty Engels - Bill Lerach independent
ticket have announced their platforms for
the Student Government (SG) campaign.
Both platforms have planks concerning the
much discussed problems of the SG Consti-
tution, Student Activities Fee, dormitory

rules and the Book Center.

 ACTIVITIES FEE ‘ .
'1 ' On the subject of the Student Activities
Fee, the P.P.P. urged that “a committee of
ﬁve members appointed by SG should be
established to distribute the activities fee.”
Engels‘ asks for “Student Government’s con-
trol of the Student’s Activities Fee.” He
does not spell out any possible changes.
Presently the Activities Fee _is distribut-
ed by a Committee composed of two mem-
bers appointed by SG and two members ap-
pointed by the Student Affairs Committee..

P SG CONSTITUTION

The P.P.P. urges the adoption by refer-
endum vote of the newly proposed SG Con-
stitution. The P.P.P. feels the constitution
embodies two outstanding . features: “The
University Review Board, composed of stu-
dents, faculty and administrators who have
the right to review in cases of “any disput-
ed academic, legal ordisciplinary de:.isi_ons,”
and (2), The General Assembly with two
representatives from-every recognized stu-
‘ dent organization.

suspension.”

Engels_and Lerach do not discuss the
proposed constitution, in their platform, but
do ask for a judiciary branch of SG. This
branch, consisting of students, faculty and
administrators, who would revise “arbi-
trary decisions effecting student

> DORMITORY’ RULES

Both platforms call for a change in ,
dormitory rules. Engels’ platform_asks for
a M.D.C.-SG Committee to liberalize hous-
ing rules and for “co-ed study hour at least
once a week for all floors .

SUB Public Affairs Series;
Vance Packard Next Guest

Theodore C. Sorensen, special counsel to the late Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy, will speak at the Student Union
Board public affairs series at noon today in ‘the Student

1-(.,,,_yUnion Ballroom. Sorensen will meet informally with Uni-

versity faculty and students at a coffee hour at 3 p.m.
‘When Kennedy was elected President, his first appoint-

ment was to name Sorensen his
‘special counsel. Sorensen began
his public service as an attorney
for the Federal Security Agency.

In 1953, he joinedxthe staff of the -

then newly-elected Senator Ken-
nedy, ‘serving as. his administra-
tive assistant. Sorensen worked
for Kennedy for 11 years.

 Shortly after Kennedy’s death,

Sorensen left the White House
staff to Write an account of his
Years with Kennedy. .His book,
Kennedy, was published in the
fall of 1965.

During Kennedy’s entire poli-
tical career, sorensen was a ma-
jor aide. He was with him‘ dur-
ing the key crises and turning

points, including the race for the

— vice-presidency at the 1956 Na_-

  

tional Democratic Convention,
the launching of Kennedy’s pres-
idential candidacy, the speech to

;~“il§‘-the Protestant clergy of Hous-

ton, the TV debates with Nixon,
and election night at Hyannis
Port.

Sorenson’s appearance today is
the ﬁrst of several speeches by
prominent people at the public
affairs series. Author Vance Pack-
ard will speak Jan. 26, and C01-

IFC Begins
Winter Rush

  i At Smoker

Inteffraternity Council Rush
Chairman B_obby Uhl predicts “a
turnout bigger than last year” at
the IFC smoker this Thursday’
night in the Student Union ball-
room. Uhl expects increased par- 1
ticipation because of the larger
number of men rushing and even-
tually pledging fraternity during
the fall term. _

Formal Rush will extend from
7 a.m. Friday until 2 a.m. Jan.
23. There will be no open rush
period this term.‘ One [major ‘
change is that ‘there will be no

» dated or combo parties allowed

on either of the two Fridays, dur-
ing rush. Fraternities have been
encouraged to have stag aﬁairs
on these nights at which time
they could meet and get to know
rushees.

The P.P.P. advocated that all organiza-
tions unite to urge the_ enactment of the
M.D.C. proposal that institutes _ a basic
change in the regulations concerning visit-
ing hours in the Men’s Dorms. This would
permit weekly visiting on Friday and Sat-
urday nights.
> THE BOOK CENTER ~

The P.P.P. feels ,.the students should re-
ceive the same 10 per cent discount from
the Book Center. They feel this would be
the .first of “several steps toward the ‘ulti-
mate goal of a University. Cooperative.
Engels suggests that the University s legal
department should arrange with the_ state
to drop the five per cent sales tax In the
Book Center upon presentation of the all-
purpose ID card.

-No‘ Move by SG.

WEDNESDAY, _lANUA_RY 11:12., 1966
Legislator Predicts 
Closer State Ties  

. ' The Pennsylvania House Subcommittee on Higher Edu-
cation will meet during the week of Jan. 24 to ask Governor
William Scranton to call a special session of the 1966 State

Legislature to act on a closer relation between the Univer-'_,

sity and the State. The move was decided at a meeting of ,

the subcommittee and University administrators

the Chancellor’s office.
Chairman of the Sub-committee
Representative ‘H. Beryl Klein,
Aliquippa Democrat, urged that
the state act quickly to effect
changes as “early as'Septembe'r,
1966.” A delay of a year could
hurt the University, he said. _
Rep. Klein did not specify if the

-- Cornell or Temple plan for state-

affiliation is‘ being more serious-
ly considered,4but he quoted $450
per year as a possible ﬁgure for
tuition if the University becomes
state-related. The ﬁgure is the
same.as that forecast for Temple
University in its new state status.

Rep. Klein did not expect the
low tuition to be realized for
many years but stated that the
1966 Legislative may allocate
funds to begin the tuition reduc-
tion. In any event the University
‘would gain no additional funds
to alleviate its ﬁnancial crisis as

MDC Bans P.P.P. Signs;

Claims Violation of Rules

By FRED FRANK

The Men’s Dormitory Council
(MDC) Election Committee has
banned the Pitt Progressive Par-
ty (PPP) from putting up signs
and distributing handbills in the
dorms. The MDC election com-
mittee issued the punishment last
Monday night because the _PPP
violated an MDC rule which pro-
habits dorm campaigning until
next Monday.

According to the NDC Elec-

.tion Committee, members of the‘

PPP early Monday morning “con-
spicuously violated the ‘above
rule by distributing campaign lit-
erature underneath the ﬂoors of
Men’s Dorms.” "Any further vio-
lation by the PPP will be report-
ed to the Student Government
Election Committee (SGEC) for
disciplinary action.

SGEC met Monday afternoon
and decided not to act on the
PPP violations, due to ' pleas by
representatives of the party that
they had not understood that this
violation would be subject to
SGEC disciplinary action.

V Before the MDC decision was
announced, the PPP issued a
statement in which they said that
they had “no alternative but to
-break those rules.” The statement
continued, “We have consulted
with the president of MDC, de-
liberated with the MDC Policy
Committee, appealed with mem-
bers of the faculty. . . . We have,
in other words, exhausted every
available legal ‘channel in. an at-
tempt to have these rules elim-
inated.” ‘ ‘

V / In» the same ‘statement, they

  
   

lated by “the MDC rule banning
the free expression of ideas with-
in the university community.”
“We agreed to disobey the rules
of the MDC primarily to abide
by our principles and stand for
what we believe,” they continued.
While SGEC took no action
-against the PPP, Jerry Hogan,
president of SG and a member
of SGEC, described himself as
“very, very disturbed” by the sit-
uation. ’ _ g
' In a letter sent to the three SG
presidential candidates, Hogan
said his personal opinion was
that there has been “a deliberate
and ﬂagrant violation and it was
not acted upon because of a tech-
nicality. I feel the PPP has gone

one step too far in testing the ,

rules of SGEC.”

The source of the problem was
the PPP’s ﬁrst issue of their of-
ﬁcial bulletin, “Common Sense.”
The three page mimeographed
publication included the PPP‘s
objective in the campaign and
their platform. It was slipped pn-
der doors of rooms in the men’s
and women’s resident halls
around 12:15 am. last Monday
morning. . '

y BILL JEROME

The attitudes, tempera-
ment, and vitality of Eliza-
bethan life were uniquely
and successfully re-created
last week in the University
Theatre production of “An
Elizabethan Miscellany,” a
spoken anthology of the lit-

erature of that age.

The Miscellany, which featured
selections from Shakespeare’s
plays, was unusual in that the
work of several authors was of-
fered rather than readings from
only one. The arrangement of the
selections was to blend diverse
passages into careful patterns of
contrast and similarity. ‘

‘The seven readers——Harriet A1-
len, James Berry, Sharon Eck,
Wandalie Henshaw, John Krich,
Harvey M. Miller, and Forrest
Sears—offered passages “. . . of
Love . . . of Occupation . . . of
the Theatre,” and these formed
Act I of the production.

Featured in this act were con-
secutive passages from Shakes-
peare’s Romeo and J uliet‘-—
spoken by Harriet Allen, James
Berry, and Sharon Eck — and
Troilus and Cressida—given by
Wandalie Henshaw and John
Erich. Here, the contrast between
untainted and tainted love was
accentuated, and visually put
forth by having the ﬁrst group

Action ‘The Trime

of speakers on the left side of
the stage, with the second group
on the right.

Another area of,.contrast in the
production was created through
the variation of sound and de-
livery. Thus, Forrest Sears’ sol-
iloquy as the Porter in Macbeth
—-“Knock, knock. Who’s there, in
th’ devil's name?”—diﬁered in
pitch and syntax with the next
passage, from Act IV, scene ii of
Measure for Measure—-“If you
think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him
abide here with you” — and
spoken by James Berry, John
Krich, and Harvey M. Miller. '

In Act II, the Miscellany con-
tained selections dealing with
more weighty subjects: “Dreams
and Visions . . . Death and Cor-
ruption and . . . Kingship.” Fea-
tured in this act were readings
from Hamlet, Julius Caesar, and
King Lear, as well as passages
from The Wonderful] Yeare by
Thomas Dekker and A Dialogue
Against the Pestilence by Wil-
liam Bullein.

The 54 selections were chosen
not to be a cumulative identiﬁ-
cation quiz for Shakespeare buﬁs,
but were arranged to form a sin-

-gle thread of the “Elizabethan

voice” during that Arranger-Di-
rector Glorianne Engel termed
“an Elizabethan day.”

No modem-day narration was
inserted between passages since

this would have destroyed the
continuity of the production, and
no references to character, act,
scene, or line were announced
since, as Miss Engel put it, “the
language itself says enough.”

And although full familiarity
with the texts themselves would
have made the language in the
Miscellany less of an obstacle,
the inﬂection and facial expres-
sions of the speakers provided
many cues which helped greatly
in keeping up with the dialogue.

The lighting, too—by Philip R.
Eck—provided visual cues and
mood variation, as did staging.
The mere alternation of male
and female voices was another
contrasting device that prevented
monotony by varying the sound
of the language.

An Elizabethan Miscellany is .

an example of what the con-
temporary mind can create out
of the material of the past, re-
arranging it into a new, organic
form. The readers and produc-
tion staff deserves credit for not
allowing the modern theatre to‘
decay to the level suggested by
one of the selections in the Mis-
cellany, “A Sermon Preached at
Pawles Crosse” by Thomas White:

“The cause of plagues is sin . . .

“And the cause of sin are
plays . . . '

“Therefore, the cause of plagues
are plays.”

the University depended on an emergency loan then pending from the State
of Pennsylvania. Then it was a loan, now it is everything.
The University,_through the Board of Trustees, and the State of
' Pennsylvania, through Senator Albert Pechan and Representatives H.
Beryl Klein, have resolved that the University will become more state-
affiliated as soon as possible.
'. A There is no sense in debating the issue of increasing the affiliation—-
it is inevitable. Furthermore, it solves numerous problems: plans are that
tuition will be reduced by nearly two—thirds; enrollment will double, and
-‘there will be increased resources for buildings and facilities.
, Current plans also call for increased numbers of graduate assistants
.‘and atstable fiscal backing to maintain quality professors on the faculty.
The only problematic issue, other than timing of the new affiliation, /
becomes the structure of the University under an increased state affilia-
tion. Two major plans now under consideration are the Cornell Plan and

The more equitable plan is -the Cornell Plan through which the state

   

 
 

contracts with the University for certain educational services. At Cornell

these are state-ﬁnanced programs in veterinary medicine, home economics,
industrial relations, and agriculture. _

_ By using the Cornell plan the University could relieve the burden on
many of its graduate schools. The state-ﬁnanced arrangement for both a
graduate and undergraduate program in business administration would
relieve substantial financial strain. Other possible areas for such programs
might be education, engineering, and social work.

These ﬁelds provide necessary talent for the state and merit in-
creased state support following the Cornell plan. Unfortunately, the Tem-
ple plan is the most lucrative considering the University’s current status.

It is better suited to relieve costs of increased building, maintenence,
and tuition. It also places the University in the lap of political manuever-
ing. The Cornell plan would allow a reciprocal relationship and not the

one-sided political intrusion evident in the Temple plan.

has the power.

There I was riding in my, car on the
bumpy cobblestone streets manuevering be-
tween the street car tracks when I heard a
surprising news bulletin. Ronald Reagan,
master of ceremonies of Death Valley’ Days
and star of numerous grade B movies, had
announcedhis candidacy for the Republican
nomination for Governor of California.

When I arrived at the Student Union at
8 am, I immediately found a host of stu-
dents discussing the political phenomenon.
The recently-awakened prophets were hud-
dled before the broken television set in the
Lower Lounge discussing Reagan’s chances.

“I LIKED him in Death ‘Valley Days,”

‘ said one critic, yawning restlessly. “He has '_
 dynamism and that's what I like. After all,
Newupqen ,

how many people could talk about the
thrills of the Old West while 20 mules and
few dusty wagons were roaring by? The
Old Ranger never could, but Reagan has the
class.” V

I ASKED HIM whether he felt Rea g°.n’s
preoccupation in the entertainment indus-

~-., try would hinder his ability in politics. “The
* probability is no,” he said. “All the public

wants anyway is an actor. They fell for
George Murphy as U.S. Senator and he ap-
peared. in the same type of movies as Rea-
gan. I remember my parents saying how
bad the melodramas and two-bit westerns
were, but they sure went 'over,in politics.”

Another meditative- student interceded
at this point. ‘.‘Yes, I'll agree wholehearted-
ly. In fact such events lend support to my
theory of politics being the trash can for
defunct actors. I see the trend formulating

and Reagan’s election should follow log'ic- A

ally.” -

I THEN questioned a third prophetic

Duquesne University will con-

ing‘courses to a Department of
Communications Arts in Septem-
ber. Specialized courses in “news-
reporting, adiertising and public
relations will be eliminated, em-
phasizing a “broad understand-
ing of modern communications.”

The journalism department was
recently under attack by staff
members of the student newspa-
per, Duquesne Duke, who charged
censorship. University officials
said there was no connection be-
tween the subsequent staff resig-
nations and the change.

would sacrifice as much educational integrity as the Temple plan should

filiation with Barry Goldwater in the last
campaign. “Well, Barry was a loser all the
way and ‘even Reagan’s tear-jerking tactics
couldn't help him. But I don't think it will
serve as any stigma‘ on Reagan’s campaign
—-he’s, got the pull.” ~

. “What do you mean pull?” I said. “Well,
he’s able to,butter—up the old people, the
legionnaires, and the boys from the Veter-
ans of Foreign Wars. He can appeal to the
youth with this pop art angle. Pretty soon
he and Murphy will be making the theatre
rounds like Batman. L .

“FURTHERMORE, all the Hollywood
people will support him avidly‘. He’s too
much of a risk to them with all that talent.”

“But What about his personnel?” I ask-
ed. “Who would he enlist to conduct the
state's affairs?” '

“Oh his cabinet will be no problem,” said

' the yawning student, “He’ll probably use a
group of loyal party people to do lthe work, ‘

while he attends parties, shakes hands, and
delivers heartwarming speeches.”

THE OTHER TWO violently disagreed.
“No, no, no,” one said. “Can’t you just see
the campaign gimmick of saying a- cabinet

-of all stars will follow with Reagan’s elec-

tion? Jack Benny as City Treasurer, Sean
Connery as Chief of Police, Raymond Burr
as District Attorney, James Franciscus
heading the Board of Education, and Ray-
mond Massey in charge of Public Health.”

f‘It’s a cinch,” the other said. “They all

know the roles perfectly. There would be no 

problem of adjustment. . ..

“So you all agree Reagan will make it as-

Hoopsters Entertain Westminster

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Westminster College, per-
ennial leaders of the West-
ern Pennsylvania basketball
conference, visits Fitzgerald
Field House tonight to con-
front the Panthers, who at

times wish that they were mem-
bers of that conference. Game
time is 8:15.

The Titans bring a 5-5 record
into the contest. Not only would
they like to go over the .500
mark at the hoopsters’ expense,
but they would also like to avenge
the double beatings inﬂicted by
the Panthers last season.

The cagers found Westminster
to be the “breather” on their

schedule, winning 85-71 in New
Wilmington, and crushing the
Titans 101-71 here.

Nevertheless, Pa 11 t h e r coach
Bob Timmons doesn’t look to
that easy a time tonight. One rea-
son is the Westminster spark-
plug, 5-10” guard John Fontanel-
la who averages 19 points a
game. “Fontanella is the man
we'll have to watch,” said Tim-
mons.

“Since they aren’t a big team,
we can expect them to run a lot
and play a tight defense,” he
added. Westminster’s tallest play-
er is their 6-5” center Bruce Na-
gle, the club’s leading rebounder.

After facing VPI’s 6-10” Jim
King, Panther center Jim LaVal-

 

Being Frank

WE’RE REBOUNDED
One Team We don’t have to be afraid to admit to this
term will be the Freshmen basketball team. They may be
the only winning team the whole term.
If I were Herman Melville I would write a story using

I the fresh as the symbol of hope for basketball at the Uni-

versity. This new hope was brought about by Bob Timmons
who recruited with a new vigor after two years of poor
freshmen teams. Also Tim Grgrich along with Carl Peter-
son branched out a little more than usual and grabbed a
few prizes.

The freshmen are an example of what good recruiting
can do. Bob Timmons had three of the boys sold in their
junior years. Tony DeLisio, Al DeFrischia, and Frank
Clemens had their minds made up early because of Tim-
mon’s persistence. .

One player Timmons couldn’t visit regularly and watch
perform was Sylvester Stevenson. He's from Tulsa, Okla-
homa. Julius Peques, a star from the Don Hennon era in
1958, was responsible for Stevenson’s scholarship offer.
Peques is working in the Tulsa area.

Len Kalata played here in a Catholic tournament and he
caught the eye of Timmons and Grgurich, who then guided
him here. Dave Welty is at Pitt on a baseball scholarship

’ and is a pitcher-outfielder. He is also the spirit guy on the

court and moves the team.

According to Grgurich the squad could have been much
better if they would have recruited a big man. Cliff Par-
sons, the 6-10” star from Gateway High School, was the
one who got away. Parsons wanted to go to a good engineer-
ing school and Pitt was high on his list. His final choice,
however, was the Air Force Academy, a decision that sur-
prised both Timmons and Mel Cratsley from Carnegie Tech.

Parsons was 6-10” and was accepted into a service aca-
demy where there is supposedly a limit on height. He also
told everyone that he wanted to go to a good basketball
school, something for which the academy is not noted.

Another loss was Hank South, probably the best high
school basketball player in the state’s Catholic I.-ea,<rues. He
had hopes of going to Cornell, Duke or Pitt. He then nar-
rowed it down to Pitt and Cornell and chose Cornell since
both of his parents graduated from there.

We can miss one or two players if we don’t miss nine
or ten as we did in previous years. Already Timmons has
planned a recruiting program and has it well in progress by
havinnf contacted 70 boys.

This rejuvenation of basketball will be reflected in the ‘

schedule next year when the Panthers play North Carolina
and North Carolina State.

ley should be able to dominate
the boards tonight against the
smaller Nagle. “If we can get
our share of the rebounds,” Tim-
mons said, “we’ll be all right.”

The hoopsters defeated Carne-
gie Tech, the only common op-
ponent of the two squads, 54-51,
in the season opener. Westmins-
ter dl‘0DDed a 74-65 decision to
Tech.

Smith plays excellent defense
in the backcourt but has been
unable to ﬁnd the range in his
shooting. McNally, on the other
hand, has been shooting and
playing well of late, according
to Timmons.

Sophomore Ken Bollens still
hasn’t asserted himself the way

he did last year on the fresh-
man team. It’s his job to make
up for the loss through gradua-
tion of Daryle Ruby, last year’s
top scorer at 16 points a game.

Bollens appeared to have ad-
justed to Varsity forward in the
Panther win over George Wash-
ington in the Steel Bowl consola-
tion game. That night he hit for
20 points and looked very strong
under the basket. But he hasn’t
duplicated the performance as
yet.

When he does and when
Slykowny and Bob Lovett score
with last season’s regularity
(both averaged 15 points per
game) the Panthers 3-7 record

has to get better.

‘" Frosh Host Westminster J.V.’s;‘
Travel to Youngstown Tomorrow ,

,1‘oboooooeoooooooooooooooooeoeeoooeoooooooooooooooeoooooooooooooooooooooooeoooooooeoooooooU'

By ROY JACOBS

To most people, an idea of
a fun evening is not playing
a college’s J .V. basketball
team. To the freshman bas-
ketball squad, playing a J .V.
team is a means of gaining
a measure of experience
against older ballplayers.

Tonight the Cubs host the J .V.
unit from Westminster College,

and tomorrow they travel to
Ohio to meet the Youngstown

J.V.’s. Both teams are composed --

for the most part of sophomores
and juniors, giving them a two
or three year edge in experience.

“Westminster is well coached,‘
and we’ll have to work to beat
them,” forecast coach Tim Grgu-
rich. “And Youngstown, aside
from the juniors and sophomores,
has three, real good freshmen.”

The coach didn’t expect to

make any changes for either,

game.
“So far we haven’t had to
change. We’ve made the other
teams change to our way. We’re
not going to change for anybody.”
The team has been gaining ex-

perience against older competi-~

tion even in practice. For in-

stance, last week they scrim-

maged a team that included an
"eight-year veteran of the Nation-
al Basketball Association and
two former members of the now
defunct American Basketball
League. With practice opposition
like that, who needs a schedule?

so far, Grgurich said that “they
all are sort of a surprise. Last
year, all I could do was sit and
watch them. This year I can
work with them, and they really
show me something. They’ve all
improved in some way this sea-
son. We’ve got some real comers.”

Grgurich is also quick to ac-
knowledge the work of his subs
—John Cassianni, John Cullen,

Rhett Heyward, and Dan Flynn."

Because of the eight scholarships,
this quartet has not seen much
action, but if they continue to
improve as they have so far; the
coach indicated some changes
could be made.

The Rohr Corporation was founded

by Fred H. Rohr in 1940 based on a
‘ ’ new idea... that he could specialize in

the design and manufacture of large

aircraft components and build them
better at lower cost than the air
The rest is history.=T0day Rohr is the nation’s largest sub-
contractor to the aerospace industry. Typical of the accept-
ance of our product is this: Rohr is building major assemblies
, at for every commercial and military mu1ti- A
engine jet transport in production in America today. Yet,
We’re widely diversiﬁed . . . designing, building and erecting ~ A  
e tracking antennas around the world, for; instance
. . . and fabricating large missile and space I
components such as rocket _engine nozzles andliners. Re-
cently Rohr has acquired large, new, long-term contracts.
More are still sun-announced. The future looks bright here,
and We’re looking for bright, young engineers to help keep it
that way.“ A I D

The United States Steel Cor-
' poration has awarded two grants
» totaling $45,000 to the Depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering
. for research, according to Dr. Ed-
ward B. Stuart, department chair-

The grant is unique in that it
7 is the first research grant the de-
partment has received directly
from a local company rather than

sociation or institute.

The projects, which begin the
ﬁrst of the year, deal with fun-
damental problems in steel-mak-
ing. They are:

,_ A Study of Heat Transfer in
if Moving Boundaries Under the In-
T. ﬂuence of Simultaneously Heating
. A and Cooling. The project is expect-

Jmelting and freezing metals. Dr.
John W. Tierney, professor of
chemical engineering, is project
director.

1A Study of the Effective Ther-
mal Conductivity of Packed Beds
— of Dissimilar Soldis. This project,
directed by Dr. Charles S. Be-
roes, associate professor of chem-
» _ical engineering, is designed to
~.-_ aid in predicting the effect of
6’ various mixtures of raw materi-

als, such as coke, iron ore and
limestone, on their heat transfer
‘properties.

It’s'our Turbo-Jet 396: the V8 strong enough to run your
Chevrolet and its automatic transmission, powensteering, air
conditioning, power windows, AM/ FM Multiplex Stereo radio.
And more. Without even breathing hard.

Reason is, a Turbo-Jet V8 breathes deeper. Breathes freer.
Delivers more usable power whenever you need it—like

for safer passing. Works more efliciently. Where the smaller
engine hurries, a Turbo-Jet V8 just loafs along. You try it,
at your Chevrolet dealer’s. And nowhere else.

You can order 325 hp in any Chevrolet; 325 or 360 hp in a
Chevelle SS 396. There’s also a 427-cu.-in. Turbo-Jet (up to 425 hp) available in Chevrolets and Corvettes.
