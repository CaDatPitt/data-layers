Margaret Webb Named Head;
Sylvia Berrnan Chosen
Secretary

The election of officers for next
year and the adoption of constitu-
tional amendments marked the close
of activities for the Women's De-
bating Association at a meeting held
at Heinz house last Thursday eve-
ning. Margaret Webb, Col. ’29, was
re-elected. president, and‘ Sylvia Ber-_
man, Col. ’30, was elected secretary‘
and historian.

The constitution was amended to
the extent that members who fail to
attend two meetings will be auto-
matically dropped from membership
unless reinstated by the executive
committee.

Bessie Kahn and Catherine Plas-
ter, both of last year's graduating
class, debated the question, “Re-
solved that Our Grandchildren Are

to be Pitied.”

(Courtesy Post-Gazette)
It was reported Monday and Tues-
day-of last week that some sort of
new-fangled “intelligence tests”

were being given on some’ sort of a
wholesale plan at the Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial Hall. Your cor-
respondent determined at the time
to investigate; but it was not until
late last night that he actually got
the assignment. It was then that he
happened upon Enos V. Printwhistle.
He was tying his shoe on a water-
plug at the corner of Forbes and
Atwood streets. Mr. Printwhistle is
known throughout Oakland ands-the
east end as an “all around college
man”; so we bounded up and slap
him heartily on the back asthe ct er
member of the Omega Omega
Omega fraternity would have done.

“What reports do the watchmen
cry. down from campus walls?” we
asked Mr. Printwhistle, knowing
that he was an outstanding student
in the adjacent University.
« “Confusion worse confounded!”
was his unintelligible reply. “And,”
he added, “I am-a moron.” I

we insisted.

“Ain't you heard?” he wanted to
know.

A Deep-Dyed Conspiracy

Your correspondent hadn’t heard;
for, as a matter of fact, we knew
nothing of the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching,
which, it se,ems—-according to Mr.
Printwhistle-—-recently entered into
some sort of deep-dyed conspiracy
with the Pennsylvania College Presi-
dents’ Association and the State De-
partment of Public Instruction to
minimize the intelligence and take
away the intellectual assurance of
all those college students in the
state who expect to graduate next
month. We gathered, however, from
student Printwhistle’s scattered and
doleful remarks that all members of
these supposedly graduating classes
in the local University and colleges
were, on last Monday and Tuesday,
subjected to devastating examina-
tions covering the whole realm of
learning from arithmetic to Omaha.
Mr. Printwhistle used the adjective
“comprehensive.” These tests were
calculated,_ it is alleged, to di ver

maderthus far in their so-called edu-

cational careers. - V -

It sounded int'er_esting;. so your
correspondent pressed the distracted

speciﬁc information.
Poor Printwhistle himself was
still so all shot in mind and s irit

9, that his exposition was too inco er-

ent, and muclrof it too irrelevant, to
be quoted. However, your corre-
spondent collected a few facts and
impressions which may be regarded
as representative if not significant.

What Price Questions?

It seems that modern education
must blue-print both human emo-
tions and human understanding. The
imponderables of the mind must be
diagnosed; and vitality, as nearly as
possible, must be put on a chart. To
accomplish this, stacks and stacks of
books -—- from mid-western prize
novels to weighty tomes on whether
or not the diagonals of a parallelo-
piped bisect each other—-were piled
up and dynarnited. Scraps of paper
were picked indiscriminately out of
thearesulting debris and made the

I V basispof questions to be propounded

to the almost-educated college stu-
dents.

Such, traditional questions, stu-
dent Printwhistle said, as “Where is
it warmer or ill, the counti-y 1*”
“Which would you rather do or (lrink
buttermilk?“ “Who killed Cock
Robbin ?”.and the like, were not in-
cluded. But Pennsylvania seniors
were asked if ivory is obtained from
shell-fish; and they were required
to indicate whether or not the diﬂ‘or-
ential is a part of a radio set. And,
furthermore, they were required to
consider the slope of a. line through
(1-4) ' and (3,2) and then tell
whether it (the slope, presumably)
is 3 or -0.5 or 45 degrees or 1.5.
The truth or falsehood of this state-
ment was questioned: “Horatius,
poets. clarissimus, patre libertino
riatus est’; and, also the question-
naire wanted to know, what about
this, “Morgen ist nicht heutc”?
Some more questions —— implied or
deﬁnitely stated--were: “Which is
the richest in fish, Assyria, Attica,
Spain, Cicily, or Phoenicia?” “In the
‘Odyssey’, were women pictured as
slaves of their lords, as unusually
inconstant, as very inﬂuential in the

and distraught University‘ senior for,

direction of affairs, "or as universally
chaste?” “By 1840, were only about
twenty-ﬁve per cent of English fac-
tory operatives adult males?”
Literature Comes Into Own

Literature, naturally, was given
its ﬂing-—since, Mr. Printwhistle
said, it still has 3. small bertii in
some curricula. Your correspondent’s
informant reported, however, that
the en ineering students walked out
in 3 ody because of such direct
insults as: "Is

’Convolvulus in streaked vases
ﬂush. The creeper, mellowiiig for an

autumn blush,’
in the manner of Pope, Burns,
Chaucer, or Keats?”

There was, so Mr. Printwhistle in-
timated, no little concern manifested
in the questionnaire as to whether or
not Erasmus preferred the “philos-
ophy of Christ” to Luther's “apple of
discord." College seniors should
know, too-—if, accordln . to Mr.
Printwhistle, the Carnegie Founda-
tion’s questions are a criterion-—i'f
1,000,000, 5,000,000, 10,000,000, or
20,000,000 people attend the moving
picture theatres daily in the United
States; and they should have learned
also whether in 1900 the women
wore shirtwaists, “teddies,” (the
quotes are the Carnegie Founda-
tion’s), corests, bustles, and perma-
nent waves. Incidentally--it must
have been incidentally, M1‘. Print-
whistle asseverated-—this question
was likewise asked: “Is a black tie
worn with a dinner coat?”

Education Deﬁned

And so on through the entire
gamut of alleged knowledge, accord-
ing to Enos V. Printwhistle. “All of
which proves,” he declared as he tore
his hair at thoughts of last Monday
and Tuesday in Memorial Hall--“all
of which proves, to quote an ancient
philosopher w h o e s c a p e d the
‘achievements tests,’ that ‘an edu-
cation is the sum-total of the things
you haven’t learned.’ ”

a career. . It is worth thinking about. The choice of

a career is important. Life insurance is most desirable:

and satisfactory as a permanent

That is the story of one who began It the bottom

education. The advantages are with you who grad-

Satisfaction

But all the pay and all the
advancement possible are not
going to wholly satisfy the in-
telligent college greduate. Life
insurance offers further satis-
faction. It is one of the great
factors in the modern world
making for security. peace of
mind, increase of conﬁdence.
and the building up of credit 1

vancement depends entirely *3-=
on your own effort and ability.

This is no fairy-talc of success. It is the sober and
proved fact. The Vice-President of a great life in-
surance compsny who began his career as an agent
has this to say to seniors who are about to graduate
from college:

“If you love work and desire to pursue an honor-
able, useful and lucrative ‘mission in life, this is the
business for you toltakc up. Life insurance salesman-
ship offers a fine field for the energies of the splendid
young men in our colleges.

“That this is true is demonstrated by those college
men who have taken up life insurance, for they have
shown tlist the college man is fit for this kind of a job
and that the job also is at for the college man.

"Theﬂwork of the life insurance salesman is dis-
tinguished by independence and opportunity for di-
recting his own activities. It gives all possible oppor-
tunity for individual initiative and a chance to make
an ample income at an age when most fellows are
struggling on a wage pittance."

 I-‘ROM DISASTROUS
 EASTERN INVASION

mi 1'; Win Single Match
so In Four Matches
On Trip

BLANKED BY PENN TEAM

ﬁiirarthinore, Georgetown,
, .aNavy Upset Weakened
_ . Panther Aggregation

 

'”'Four times in as many days the

fvarsity racqueters fell before the ter-

rific onslaught of the best tennis
‘teams in the East, and not once dur-

‘ing -the four matches did the Pan-
zﬁthers as much as force their op-

ponentssto close scores. This East-

i era invasion will go down in history
- asfthe most disastrous that the Pitt
. net inen have ever experienced.

'.?e‘rin 'took the boys over, 8-0, in

_j;'  opening match. The next day
jtthy went to Swarthmore and fell

" '11, 7'2-

. Friday they played
‘rgetown; here they made their

5 bést showing of the trip, but went
 down to defeat, 5-2. Saturday they
7 ended;-tlie_ slaughter by losing to

Navy by an overwhelming margin,
8-1. ‘Sunday morningthe boys were
back in town and were happy to
think. that the massacre was over.

" Thezboys have good reasons to ac-
count for their showing. They were
handicapped b _the oss of their
captain, John 'Leiughlin, who was
unable to‘-make the trip on account
of -his work in the dental school.
Then, too, -Dr. Stephens could not

' make the trip and By Baur was

forced to take care of the trip.

The boys saw some good tennis
and learned a thing or two about
, e game. The greatest difficulty
that the" team encountered was the
fact that the Easterners use new
balls:-for every set. . Our men. do not
get sufficient practice with new balls
and when they played Swarthmore
‘and Navy they were greatly handi-
dapped. .It seems that after a set

f or two the fuzz wears‘ off the ball

and it becomes lighter in weight.

~ ~- The ball must be hit with a different

 force when it is‘ worn than when it
. -- is new.“ Our boys found that when
’  ,tl'f‘ey hit. the new balls with extraordi-
.w . nary force they would merely float
‘. across the net very slowly.

. The match with Penn was played
on. indoor courts because of ram.

 Two "courts were used in Weight-

nian Hall, the Penn gymnasium, and
The team
was not “used to these courts and
was ‘seriously handicapped because

PANTHER SPIKERS
BEATEN BY LIONS

Carry Nine Firsts But Lose As
State Runners Sweep
Distances

Coach Frank Shea’s undefeated
Golden spikesters travelled to Penn
State last Saturday ” and received
their ﬁrst set-back of the season at
the hands of Coach Carlmell’s
mighty Lions, 80-55. Although the
Panthers coppednine first places the
Blue and White thinnlies took ad-

vantage of seconds and thirds to
score their triumph.

Welch and Wibecan were the
leading scorers, Gibby scoring 1_8
points while Ken was was responsi-
ble for 15 tallies. Bates of State
was high for the Lions with a count
of 14%. Welch took the discus, shot
and javelin and placed second in the
broad jump. Wibecan led the ﬁeld
as usual in the sprints making a
clean sweep of first places in the
100-yard, 220-yard and 440-yard
dashes. " .

Vic Pickard had an easy time of
it in the pole vault, a vault of 11
feet 3 inches bein sufficient to put
him ahead of ,his nearest State
rival. Knobloch split even in the
hurdle events, the Pitt tinviber-top-
per winning the 120-yard high hu'r-
dles, but lost’ a close race in the
220-yard low hurdles to Bates. Pitt's
distance men were completely out-
classed, the Lions’ distance men
taking all three places in the 880-
yard, the mile and two-mi‘e runs.
Don Gwynn, the little Panther‘ ham-
mer thrower, who weighs o'n1y 155
pounds,-heaved the pellet 161 feet 1
inch‘ to beat all competitors by sev-
eral feet.

Pantherlings Lose

The State freshmen defeated the
Pittfrosh 96 to 39 in a preliminary
to the varsity meet, scoring first in
11 of the 15. events and getting
more than an even share of t e sec-
onds and thirds.‘ The Lion yearlings
scored slams in four events and
took first and second in two others.
Musser of the State frosh turned in
an "excellent hurl of the javelin
which netted him 180 yards 2 inches,
9. mark less than two feet from that
set by Captain Gibby Welch.

JACOBS TO PLAY .
IN RICHMOND, VA.

Panther Fresh Net Captain
Entered In Huge Net
Tournament

Edward Jacobs, captain and star
player on t e yearling net team, left
last night or Richmond, Va., where
he has been invited to play in the
Twenty-second Annual Old Domin-
ion Tournament. This tournament
ranks with the highest of the South-
ern tournaments in prestige and im-
portance.

The cream of the tennis world
that is not on the Davis Cup teams

will play in the tournament; the best
known players that have already en-
tered are John. Van Ryan of Prince-
ton. Emmett Pare of Georgtown and
champion of Maryland; Johnny
Doeg, youthful star; Frank Shields,
who holds both the indoor and out-
door National Junior titles, and Al-
phonse Smith of the University of
Virginia. The matches are played
on 14 courts which are the best in
the state. Men’s singles and don-
bles, women’s singles and doubles
and mixed doubles are included. It
is unusual that none of the seeded
players will be allowed to draw a
bye, but must play every round.
Young Jacobs has played with these
celebrities before, but has never’ be-
fore participated in this tournament.
He is planning to play doubles with
Alphonso Smith whom he has played
with in previous tournaments.

This year the Old Dominion. tour-
ney is more important than ever be-
cause -the men who make a good
showing will be invited to St. Louis
this summer to participate in-the
eliminations for the Olympic team.

DEAN AMOS SPEAKS.
ON SEX PROBLEMS

“Sex relationship must be taught
to every one from a biological
standpoint in order to do away with
the present vulgarity of sex,” said
Thyrsa_ W. Amos, dean of women, in
the third of a series of discussion‘
groups sponsored by Y. W. C. A.,
Monday, at 12:30 o'clock, at Heinz
house, on “Problems of Sex."

Miss Amos said that successful
marnage is based upon a thorough
scienti c knowledge of the sex re-
lationship.
the discussion that ignorance is the
cause of the‘present vulgarity of
sex and that the Ch.istian Church
in_ the middle ages had much to do
with the vulgarizing of sex by re-
pressing women and by setting them

a. apart from. every one else,,in re.

gard_ to sex relationship.

Miss Amos stated that although
women have more freedom now than
.they ‘ever had their independence
would not be complete until the vul-
garit of sex is completely elimi-
nfite from the minds of the ‘pea-
P e. s A .
Another of these talks on “Prob-
lems of Sex” willbe given next Mon.
day at Heinz house by Dean Amos.

Action of Explosives

 

Q

Lesson No. 1 of V . . .
BLASTERS’ HANDBOOK“

LL explosives are solids or liquids that can be in- .

' stantaneously converted by friction, heat, shock,‘
sparks or other means into large volumes of gas. That‘ '
sounds simple, but this fundamental principle of the ac- .

tion of explosives is modiﬁed by a host of circumstances.

First there are “high” and “low” explosives. Then there are  '

circumstances of purpose, methods of loading and firing and ‘han-

' dling and storing. Explosives are measurcdprincipally by these

eral characteristics: Strength, Velocity, Water Resistance
ity, Fumes, Temperature of Freezing, and Length an
Duration of Flame.

Chapter One of the Blastem’ Handbook makes this seemingly com-

plicated subject very easily mastered. Charts and tables explain .
relative energy of different strengths. Other characteristics are _.

"explained in classroom terms, and amply illustrated.

- - Many of the leading technical colleges, universities and schools

are using the Blasters’ Handbook in their classroom because of
its perfect practicality. Made up by du Pont ﬁeld service men out

of their own experience in a great many ﬁelds over a great many

years. The text-booksof the “school of experience.”

SUGGESTS THAT COURTESY BE

SHOWN STUDENT COUNCIL"
Editor The.Weekly:

I am sure you mistook the inten-
tion of Student Council in publishing
its note to your editorial staff last
week.

The letter implies that Council is
worthy of more respect than your
recent editorial showed. Certainly,
then, the councillors did not intend
to present themselves to the students
in such a" poor light as they have
in their note.

The insulting and overbearing
curtness of the ultimatum sounds
like the order of an uncultured,
trench sergeant to a private whose
superior intelligence he instinctively
recognizes—not like a communica-
tion between gentlemen and fellow
students.

I might trace the unfortunate
spirit of the note directly or in-
directly to an inﬂuence which I hesi-
tate to mention, but-—

'A youthful council that has been
habitually bullied, insulted and
otherwise “advised" is not apt to let
slip an opportunity to vent its ac-
cumulated ill-feeling on any equal
who does not accord it due respect.
Perhaps the note was written
after due deliberation. But we ‘may
assume that the deliberation took
place, as usual, in a petty, malicious
atmosphere for which the Council is
but to a small extent responsible.
And I repeat, therefore, that it
was a rather mean trick to degrade
Councilbefore the student body‘ by

I would have to hold you responsible
for the perhaps toofrequent ignor-
ance and ill-manners of your’ edi-
torials; and I would -justify Council
in holding you so responsible. . ‘

I attribute the malicious pettiness
of this old feud .to.the.=more_ funda-
mental cause which I have already
mentioned and to the poor,and" per-
haps merely thoughtless example set
by your neighbor across the park.

I suggest that The Weekly ‘show
gentlemanly courtesy in ‘manner
even toward Council. ‘But that the
manner ,9nly,neoer the substance be
modiﬁed. I suggest that The Weekly
disregard Council’s implied threat
until some higher authority declares
that the power in Council's hands
is for the purpose to which Council
suggests putting it andnot for an
entirely different purpose.

CAP AND GOWN

ATURDAY night the Tempos,
S Plebiano and Rubato went
Capandgowning. Rubato, as
usual, was late, and we missed the
overture and opening chorus. What
they were like is, of course, im-
possible to say, but the rest of the
show was good-—furthermore, it
wasdarn. good. Of course I don’t
say that it was better than some
of the old standbys like The Stu-
dent Prince, but it was much better
than two or three “professional"
shows that appeared on the Pitts-

burgh boards this season.

Mary ‘seemed to have a bit more
plot than _'is usual in C. & G. shows,
but not‘ enough toharm it (plots
should be? left to mystery plays
and_S. E. P. short stories). Ascor-
tain English instructor accuses’
me of beingtooi high hat in my mu‘-
sical tastes-—-but. that's neither here
nor _there (nor any place else)-—
most of« the music in this year’s
show was as good as a lot of the
big-time stui! fresh “from a year’s'
«run on. Broadway.” The Barom-
irolle in the. second act and a cou-
ple of the comedy songs were a lit-
tle list, but such catchy, hits as
“I'm: Broken Hearted” and‘ “Mary-
Grow-Round” are hard to beat. The
.._“Mary."‘ refrain is the kind of thing
you whistle, for‘ a month after you
hear it‘. We purchased a com’ of
The Panther-‘ (adv.}— and have been
playing the,.music printed therein

Fewer attempts at the sentimental
ballad? and more,jof,the. songs-with-
a-snap might. ‘help. The writer of‘

the music was the only good

dancing,-especially that of the girl's

and silver‘ costumes were’ two. bits
of work that, the excellent
 Schnabel will -' have a hard
time? bettering; The costumes were
‘worthy. of beingfpart of one of

As for_ the “cast”-the

,-I-lough, as Herr Less (or Lesz, or
Lezs, -or Lezz-—tak’e' the one that
looks? the best).- Without belittling
any others. of the cast, it may be
said‘ that this chap was the center
-of the show. Seldom have I seen
any better comedy playing--cei-
tainly not "in Cap and Gown; In
fact, he wasso good that ‘it seems
a shame to "think-. of. a good come-
dian going to pot in the mola-r-re-
-‘pair business. Another chap de-
serving special mention is. Socks,
alias Charles Hyatt, the Silent
Suitor. And the rest, too numer-
ous‘-"to¥ mention,‘ were all good.

 book of the show, of
 course, was written by Walter
.' Edmundson and the score by
Gus Schnabel. Mr. Edmundson did
the staging and Mr. Schnabel the
music directing. The fine dancing
ofboth choruses was the work of

Mrs. Schnabel‘. Mayme Algeo con-
structed all those gorgeous cos-

- tumes. All the dirty work of scene

painting, shifting, and whatnot
was done. by Dr. Earl Cox. A
