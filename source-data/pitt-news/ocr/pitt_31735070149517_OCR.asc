CREATIVE DIREBTUR 8: PHNTNGRAPHER: RANDI All]
Y lJllYER PHOTll BY RANDI All! 8: KENNY llNli

DESIGN BY GARETH GEBHARDT
BIWER llES|liNl3Y SETH SALCEDU

Dear reader, I

The horizontal tango, making love, doing the
deed: There’s no doubt our society has many means
of talking about — and around ,— intercourse.

And for most of the year, that is what society
focuses on: the act itself, leaving the vast major-
 of its effects and implications unstatéd. Today,
though, with the naked intent of Valentines Day in
promoting Hallmark sales, last—ininute ﬂower pur-
chases and romantic gestures all around, we’re go-

ing to talkabout sex. .

Sex does not just pervade our everyday lives
through raunchy advertising or other media, but
also in subtler ways in our relationships, our vgalues

 on marriage, chastity and promiscuity and society’s
1  perception of “normal.”

We don’t intend to be raunchy, though some of

., these stories might titillate. We don’t want to of-,
 fend, though some of these topics are delicate. And

'  we won’t try to shy away from subjects, especially.
 those no one talks about. We want to ﬁirther the .
 public conversation -about sex, relationships and‘
_, T  the way we all deal with both.

For this, ourlfourth year of the Sex Edition, we
at The Pitt News want to broach the subject from

:  as many perspectives as possible. In these pages,
A . f; you will ﬁnd discussions on pornography, celibacy,
f penis size and'LGBTQ issues. Online, you can ﬁnd
' more of the photos we took for this edition, as well
 as a tour of -an adult store.

V This issue does not center on the act itself, but

 the ripple effects that go out from the way we treat

one another and ourselves. Just talking about the
act borders on pomography, and ignoring it alto-
gether e or assuming college students don’t have
it — leans toward damaging ignorance.

So, ‘as always with sex, we’re hoping that we
haven’t done too much or too little, but just the right
amount. . - .

If you want to talk more about this issue, or- spe-
ciﬁc stories within it, please write to us at letters@
pittnews.com or commentonline at pitt_news.com.

Pitt students struggle to lfigure‘ out birth control

By Parthena Moisiadis
For The Pitt News

‘ Freshman Anna Doyle has had some trouble
with her birth control.

“With the pill, I forgot a lot.’ Sometimes 1

I’d take three in one day,” she said. So Doyle
decided‘ to try the NuvaRing — a once-a-
month birth control ring inserted in the

. vagina. °' . y ' ‘
“[NuvaRing] is really weird. You can feel

it. You inject it like a tampon. And you have ~

’ to refrigerate it prior to using it. My room-

mate doesn’t believe in sex before marriage, 9
which makes it awkward keeping it in our

refrigerator,” Doyle said.

Doyle is one of many students who are
exploring the best ways to manage unwanted
pregnancies and sexually transmitted dis-

. eases while staying sexually active.
' But being sexual active in college isn’t
necessarily a given. ' ' '

Joseph Petrich, president of Pitt’s

Anscombe Society .— an organization dedi-

cated to promoting abstinence, said that .

the only 100 percent effective way to avoid
a pregnancy is to not have sex.
“It is a scientiﬁc fact that is undisputed

by ‘doctors, manufacturers. of artiﬁcial con- —

traceptives and proponents of natural family
planning,” he saidin an email.

But regardless of relationship status, age.

“All of these options require a physician’s

panies cover these products, so the cost is

minimal if one uses insurance. However, if
paying out’ of pocket, oral contraceptives
cost as low as $15 per cycle to $60 per cycle,”
Wettick said.

still believe in myths about preventing preg-

In the fall, Pitt’s Student Health Services be-
gan offering a free vaccine that prevents the
human papillomavirus, the most common
sexually transmitted infectionin the U.S. and
a_ known cause of cancer. " ’

But a majority of students have yet to take
them up on their offer. A

In October of 2011, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention began to recommend
HPV vaccines to men as well as women, be-
cause men often carry the virus. .

' However, vaccination rates for HPV
among males remain low. The New York
Times reported last year that, while a third
of women across the country are vaccinated,
only 1 percent of men have received the three-
shot series. -

At Pitt, Marian Vanek, director of Student
Health Services, said that approximately 32
percent of students who have received the
HPV vaccine at Student Health are male.

That proportion is far better than the
national average, but Natasha Lejbman, the
vice president of the Student Health Advi-
sory Board, said that percentage comes out
of a total of only 1 percent of students at Pitt
who have been vaccinated for HPV through
Student Health. ‘ , e _

Pitt’s male students responded not with
distrust, but with indifference regarding the
HPV vaccine. _ ‘N A -

Steve Melick, a junior nursing major, said
he has not received the shots and was unaware
that they were offered at Student Health.

“I don’t know why I don’t have it, I guess
it hasn’t been pushed on me hard enough,”
Melicksaid. ‘ . .

Eli Maxwell, a sophomore, saidjhe’d had
his ﬁrst shot but didn?t go back_for the rest.

“I just kinda forgot about it,” Maxwell said.
“Maybe I really don’t see the need for it.”

Theredare 40 different strains of HPV,
not all__of them harmful, which are passed
on through sexual contact. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, most sexually

active people in the U.S. will have HPV at some
, point in their lifetimes. -

The most common averse health effect of.

HPV is genital warts, but HPV is also a known‘
carcinogen. In women, HPV can cause cervi- e

cal, anal, vaginal, vulvar or throat cancer. In

men it has been linked to penile, anal-and_V. .

throat cancer. -
. When the HPV vaccine ﬁrst came out in
2006, the CDC recommended it to women

between the ages of 11 and 26. In October ’ l

2011, the CDC also began to recommend Gar-
dasil for men ages 13 through 21. The vaccine
is administered in three shots, leaving more
than a month in between each dose.

A There are two brands of HPV -vaccine,
Cervarix, made by. GlaxoSmithKline, and

' V Gardasil, manufactured by Merck.

At Pitt, Student Health Services is trying to
spread the word about the HPV Vaccine.
Student Health Services has HPV: clinic

hours every Monday through Thursday from
10 a.m. to 12 p.m. from now until June dur-
ing which students can receive the vaccine

free of charge. It normally costs about $120 d

a dose. ' ‘

In addition, Student Health Services will
hold open clinic days for HPV Vaccinations on
Tuesday, Feb. 14, Friday, Feb. 24, and Wednes-
day, Feb. 29, this month in the Medical Arts
Building. _ ..

. “The open clinic days are jusf the latest
installment in ailargerj campaign to get the
word out about the HPV vaccine,” Vanek
"said; Since‘ Student «Health Services began
its Healthy U initiative in the fall of last year,
the number of students getting the HPV vac-
cine has increased. ,

“Although much better than the national

average, we hope to continue to improve this '

percentage,” Vanek said in reference to the
proportion of niale students who had been
vaccinated. - ‘ 4 '

‘ In order to do that, Student Health Ser-

. vices counts on the help of the Student Health

Advisory Board, their student—run arm de-
signed to educate the studentbody about
health issues. _

SHAB employs a variety of techniques to

get the word out about the HPV vaccines, ‘

including meetingwith the Campus Women’s
Organization and planning to table at the

. Vagina Monologues. However, attempts at
drumming up publicity are made difﬁcult. -

by the fact that SHAB consists of only 10
people. ~
“We’re a small organization,” Lejbman

. said. “Our goal is to", talk to as many people

as we can, who we know will talk to other
people.” ' _ ‘ _

SHAB’s attempts to reach male students
have not been very successful. Lejbman said
the group tried talking to the fraternities and
found them to be unreceptive.

“There’s a deﬁnite stigma,” Lejbman said; .

“When the vaccine was ﬁrst released, all the
commercials were aimed at women. Now it’s
advertised as a way men can protect women,
but men need to know that they can be af-
fected'too.’~’ ' . . -. .

' There is another reason people might
avoid the HPV shot. Since the vaccine is fairly

new, some fear that the side effects are not -
. yet fully known. . _ ' A
- Katie Boyk, a junior biological sciences .

major, did’ not receive the vaccine at the be-
hest of her mother, who is a nurse. She said
that her mother was leery about possible
unknown side effects. l _ ' . e

“I deﬁnitely wouldn’t get it now,” Boyk
said. “I don’t know if it would be OK in my
lifetime.” ' A ' —

This kind of controversy follows any new '
' vaccine. -

Vanek said there hadbeen some specula-

_ tion that the HPV vaccine might be related

to autoimmune disorders. Several research
studies, including one that included 190,000
women, found no such association.

“The HPV vaccine appears to be quite
safe,”Vanek said. I , '

Body issues can darken sex life

By Anna Weldon
Staﬂ” Writer

Many people hide‘ body issues in
the dark. ‘
“An estimated 65 to 70 percent

A of women prefer to have sex with

the lights off, while 35 percent
of men like doing it in the dark,”
said John Beiter, a sex therapist
certiﬁed by the American Asso-

‘ ciation of Sexuality Educators,
- Counselors and Therapists.

Body issues concern both men
and women. They can_be fueled
by the media, eating disorders
and common misconceptions.
Often, they affect an individual’s
life as well as ‘his or her sexual

. practices. .- . .

“Women generally desire to be
thin and have a bigger bust size,
which can result in eating dis-‘
orders and numerous cosmetic
surgery procedures. Men tend to
want to look muscular, especially
in the upper body, but still appear
thin,” said Irene Frieze, a_ profes-
sor of psychology, business ad-
ministration and women’s studies
at Pitt. . .

These issues can often serve

as the reasons that someone get-_
ting down and dirty with a part-
ner might prefer the safety of the
shadows.

“If . one feels embarrassed
about their body, they would not
want their partner to see their
body naked,” she said.

A woman is more likely than
a man to worry about her weight

and ﬁnd herself sexually unat-
' tractive, making her more self-
-conscious during sexual intima-

cy. . _
“Our culture has tried to de-
ﬁne and describe what a correct
body image is supposed to be. My

.experience is that it affects wom-

en more than men,” Beitersaid.
One of the darkest potential

. implications ofbody-image issues

are eating disorders. Although
they affect both sexes, women are
more frequently impacted by the
disorders.

Jennifer Wildes, an assistant

. professor of psychiatry and psy-

chology at Pitt who also works at
UPMC’s Western Psychiatric In-
stitute and’ Clinic, explained that

many women feel overweight or.

dislike parts of theirbodies. Eat-

ing disorders, however, can be- i

come a far more extreme issue.
Symptoms of anorexia nervo-
sa include low weight, restricted
food intake, excess exercising
and, in some cases, forced vom-
iting and laxative use. Bulimia
nervosa typically affects those
in normal and high—normal to
overweight, weight ranges, and
its symptoms include binging an
purging. . ~
“These feelings are often not
solely about appearance but also
basedoncertainpersonalitytraits.
Very often people with an eating

' disorder exhibit depression or

anxiety,” Wildes said. Losing and
controlling weight could assist in
decreasing these feelings’.

V ,f‘Inf_the world of things that
they can deﬁne themselves as,
weight and shape take up a huge
part of their lives,” Wildes said.

The concerns consuming
men’s thoughts are often less fo-
cused on actual body image.

“If anything for men, it is p'e-
nis size and less about weight,”
Beiter said. V

- Normally men are more pre-
occupied with their performance
and have strange perceptions of
how long they should maintain

 

an erection. .

In order to change negative
personal views,‘ Beiter recom-
mends a healthy,, holistic ap-
proach. He said getting the prop-
er amount of rest, exercise and
nutrition are the places to start

when working‘ to gain a more
positive outlook. But, Beiter said,
the biggest concern should be
education to reduce the perpetu-
ation of feelings of judgement.

“We need to get rid of the
myths,” Beiter said. I

By Adelia Mohan
Assistant Magazine Editor g

If anticipation heightens the experience,

the collegiate pastime of casual sex must be I
bleak. Sex is becoming expositorykto dates,

a kiss before the handshake. But who’s to
blame? Casual sex is a process easier to learn
than anything taught in class: I want you, you
want me, stop using your mouth to speak,
I’m not listening anyway. '
Most of us have either dabbled in‘ imper-
sonal hook—ups or made them our M.O., yet a

.v.V.
Q--.

Whether it’s Cosmo or The Pitt‘News, it
seems like I can’t pick up a publication
without somebody trying to tell me how to
have sex. ' V-

You’ve probably noticed this too. Peo-
ple want to tell you how to do it, when to
do it, why to do it and who to do, it with.

x And that’s totally crazy.

Human sexuality is as diverse as hu-
man beings. Some people enjoy group sex,
some ‘people want to have sex only with
their spouses and some people never want
to have sex at all. And yet, prescriptive sex
writing usuallyassumes — ludicrously —
that a gay m_an}in?a monogamous relation-
ship beneﬁtsffrom the s_ame*sug‘gestions as
a straight, single woman browsing casual
encounters on Craigslist. e

The goal of sex writing should not berto
tell people how to do it, but to encourage
them to make the best possible choices, no
matter how they do it. To that end, I pres-
ent my incredibly unprofessional opinion
on all the prescriptive sex advice you’ll
ever need.

Have safe sex. _, _ ,

Use condoms, not just to prevent un-
intended pregnancy, but to prevent STDs.

.51

At the corner of Atwood and Bates in Qakiand E 412.881.5656 1 madn'n2x.com l Vaiid ID required for drinks

-u—-Use themeven if the kind of sex you have
can’t result~inpregnancy. Put them on sex
toys if you’re sharing them with someone.
Get testedfor STDs between each partner,
even if you‘ always used protection — no
form of safe. sex is totally foolproof —— and
your last partner told you he or she had no
infectiQns;. " s
I If your sex life includes BDSM, have
‘a “safe word” that calls all activity to a
halt. Many people use the traffic light sys-
tem, where “yellow” means “slow down”
or “less of that, please” and “red” means
“cease and desist everything, immedi-
ately.” If someone is wearing a ballgag,
have a nonverbal safe signal such as a hand
squeeze. Negotiate all activities before-
hand, and stick to what you’ve negotiated
—— you cannot spring a whip on somebody
who hasn’t agreed to being whipped, even
if that person is playing your slave for the
night. If restraint is involved, know how to
tie safe knots, and have scissors or shears
on hand to cut ropes quickly in case some-
thing goes wrong.
Prioritize safety even at the cost of seem-
ing rude, distrustful or impolite -— for ex-
. ample, by asking someone you don’t know
very well if he or she has been tested for
STDs recently. Understand-that safety may
require you to be more assjjertivevthan you’re
really comfortable‘ with. Understand, also,

’A:$

 

mean you get laid less often than you would
have preferred, becayse it means opting
out of sex with anyone who refuses to take
the above safety precautions. That might
be a bummer — but if it’s any consolation,
I’ve never heard anyone say, “You know, I
sure do regret not having sex with that guy
who refused to use a condom.”

Have ethical sex.

Being sexually ethical is about honesty.
It means honoring your commitments and
respecting other people’s —— not only ab-
staining from sex with others if you’re in a
monogamous relationship,. but ‘abstaining

, from sex with anyone whose monogamous

partner isn’t you. If you’re in an open rela-
tionship, being ethical means adhering to
any agreements you have with your part-
ner about how and when you can be with
somebody else. _

Don’t mislead a partner about your in-
tentions. Don’t say that you love him when
you don’t or that you want a long—term re-
lationship with her when you really want
a ﬂing. Don’t fudge the facts about how
many people you’ve had sex with,.whether
you’ve done a certain activity before or
how recently — .even if you’ve recently
tested negative for every possible infec-
tion. If you don’t respect someone enough
to be honest with them, you don’t respect

 

Forget cookie-cu-tetr sexiadvice: Think about safe words, ethics andcunsent

that being truly committed to safety might s

them enough to have sex.

Have wanted sex.

Wanted sex means the same thing as
consensual sex, but I use this word be-
cause, despite our best efforts, many peo-
ple still understand “consent” as a lack of
kicking and screaming. I’m telling you to
only have sex that all participants really,
enthusiastically want. L

Wanted sex is unambiguous. It’s what
happens wheniPerson A says “Do you. want
to do [sexfact] with me?” and Person Bsays
“I sure do!” Sex that happens after you’ve
said no and he asked again and you said no
again and this went on until you consented
just to shut him up is not wanted sex. Sex
that happens after she guilt—trips you‘ and
says that if you really found her attractive
you would do it is not wanted sex. Wanted

sex is not, “Alright, ﬁne.” Wanted sex is

“Yes, please!”

And there is no excuse, under any cir-
cumstances, for any person in any universe
to have sex that they or their partner are
feeling less than “Yes,” please!” about, be-
cause wanted sex is easy. If you’re not sure
that the sex you’re about to have is wanted,
you ask. And if the response is signiﬁcant-
ly different in tone and content than “Yes,
please!” then you don’t do it.

  Hlowrto make that first date special - and then go on another one rightafter

By Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Even in this fast—paced, globalized 21st
century of ours, quite a’ few people in long-
term relationships have managed to reach
that stage by going on. actual dates with
their signiﬁcant others. Instead of merely
hanging out or chillaxing with their part-
' ners until both parties became too out of
shape and inﬁrm to seek-greener pastures,
many of your friends have taken the old-
fashioned route to emotional satisfaction:
scheduling activities with someone they
ﬁnd interesting and then waking up before
the crack of 5 p.m. to carry them out. ’
If that sounds daunting to you  well,
that’s because it is. Once you’ve located a
cool person through texting or online dat-
ing or Facebooking — topics we’ve dis-
cussed in greater detail in earlier columns
+ you might be required to do something
with him in order to win his affections.
This will often entail going on a ﬁrst date,
the onerous prerequisite to secon_d, third
and any other subsequent dates.
Fortunately for you, we’ve gone on hun-
dreds of ﬁrst dates. The tips and tricks we
learned during these encounters aren’t
transferable to later dates — not that it
would matter in our case, since we’ve only

rnrwrx xx/are

(,9

been on a handful of second and third
dates — but they’re guaranteed to ensure
that you and your special someone wind
up having the gr8est — nay, the gr9est -—
evening imaginable. A

So where to commence this awesome
outing? At a fancy restaurant, of course,
but also one that’s safely within your price
range. Remember: Money doesn’t grow on
those pizza‘ boxes you meant to throw out
two months ago — mold does. And until
there’s a mechanism in place to harvest
that mold and convert it into cold hard
cash, you’ll have to pinch your pennies,
give Indian burns to your nickels and lov-
ingly caress your 50-cent pieces.

If you’re looking for a luxury dine-in.

experience on the cheap, considera top-
ﬂight burger joint like Five Guys. Budget
about $15 for the hamburgers, fries and
sodas you’1lbe consuming — nothing im-
presses a date quite like a healthy appetite
—- while reminding him as frequently as
possible that you plan to “go dutch’? to-
night. Here’s a classy example of how to do
that through text messaging:

u: hey look I hope u know I’m not payin
for u tonite , .

urdate: yeah ok ‘ -

u: so make sure you bring your own
money cause like I said I’m not payin for

o

4...‘

A U T H F. N "l" l C.

ur crap
urdate: got it
u: that means_u should have cash in ur
wallet cause the $15 I’m bringin is 4 my
own food. I’m hardgainin wut wut!
, urdate: all right dawg, chill the f out. I’ll
bring $$$ 7

When you arrive together at the ‘restau-
rant, you’l1 face another hurdle: small talk;
Until now, you’ve probably been able to
slide by with cute emoticons and monosyl-
labic texts. But how on earth are you going
to ﬁll those ﬁve or so minutes when you’re
not stufﬁng your face with vinegar—soaked

A french fries and greasy bits of hamburger?

Take a page from our book: ‘

You: Hey, tell me an anecdote about
your childhood. Anything will do, really.
* Your date: Well, when I was seven, my
parents tooklme to Busch Gardens, and I
nearly. drowned  ‘

. Here’s your chance. While your date
drones on with this shaggy-dog story, you
can resume your favorite activities: setting
your Yahoo’! Sports fantasy football lineup,
checking Facebook on your celly, texting
the person you’re dating a few hours from
now, daydreaming about what it’d be like

to have so much money that you’d never’

4

 

have to get out of bed again and the like. '

When your current date forces you to com-
ment on his tall tale —— and invariably he
will ‘— just do the following:

‘ Your date: So‘ what do you think about
that? _ '

You (after a pregnant pause): Huh, that
sure was something you just said. Of the
different parts, my favorite part was the
end.

After you’ve ﬁnished ' your meal, you
might feel tempted to take your date to a
movie or a club. We must urge you to re-
sist these impulses and do the right thing:
Invite your date back to your efficiency
apartment to chillax with your four room-
mates. If this-person can’t hang with your
besties, what good is he or she to you?

Once you two crowd into that ﬁlthy rat
hole you call home, you should begin ignor-
ing your date and focusing on those besties.
You haven’t seen them for a few hours, and
they deserve your totalattention. Sit as far
away from your date as you can, and make
little to no eye contact. Start saying what-
ever it takes ‘to alienate your date. If your
date happens to be a sweet, gentle soul,
here’s the kind of «coarse dialogue that’s
sure to put him or her in high dudgeon:

- But my resolution of abstinence isn’t a
perpetual thing. Instead, it’s made up of con—'
ditions and rules aimed at eradicating the

‘practice of self-destructive behavior. Once/
if the stipulations are met, you guessed it:
game.time.~ ‘ '
In the preliminary stage, there is the ﬁve-
question system put in motion at the com-

mencement of every new encounter.‘To avoid.

revisiting past or incurring future mistakes,
I suggest everyone pose these inquires:

' “What’s your name?” —— There’s nothing
more telling of your character than if you
have to extract your face from someone’s
mouth to ask. their name. The vow of celibacy
is based in the want to be a better person with
better people.'Failing to ask or remember the
single proper noun attached to the person
you’re talking to generally means this situa-
tion won’t lead to a product of distinguished

A — quality. *

“Do you live in the state?” — I don’t know
what it is with me,butI have an out-of:state
magnetfmy emotional unavailability decided
it needed literal mileage. If this question
receives a “yes,” the proceeding move is not
toward the bedroom or someone’s couch.

p “Are you in a relationship?” —— By now,
I’m sure severa1.of youhave experienced the
terrible sex ﬁends who lie about their rela-

tionship status in order to pursue a hook-up. V

According to my track record, I am kryp;
tonite to relationships_, having involuntarily
relation~wrecked upwards of seven couples.
Any time you begin to doubt this new friend,
stick with your intuition, because they are,
more than likely, lying just to egetinto your

pants. Also,.the “We’re about to break up” I

{

answer roughly amounts to ‘ We’re ﬁghting
and I have no soul.” ‘

“Am Isober enough?” :—. A self—imposed
time—out for internal questioning ‘means:
No, it’s time to go home.

“Do you have a car?” — This question’

isn’t as necessary as the other ones, but if you-'

receive an aﬂirmative response and the in-

 

teraction turns into something, laundry and
grocery shopping will be inﬁnitely easier.
After the informal interrogation — use
thosesocial skills to tone down the creep
factor —— the next stage is to genuinely get

. to know the person. This includes conversa-

tions, not making out, dinner instead of sex

. and maybe even a snuggle session.

u

My main conditions for this celibate state
involve seeing the same person in several
consecutive romantic situations until I either
like them or_hate them less than, everyone
else. My public school education thinks I
should call this process dating, but I can’t‘
commit to that quite yet. .

These requirements seem simple enough
to fulﬁll, right? It has been ﬁve months since

Pitt police chief Tim Delaney said a

in the second ﬂoor women’s bathroom
around 4:30 p.m. on Monday. It said a

Fifty minutes later, Pitt sent out an

Chevronlwas evacuated. .

“In this day and age, this is what we do,”
Delaney said about abomb threats.

The building was cleared an hour later

said. .

“We don’t want to scare everyone, but
we have to takeprecautions,” he said.

  Pitt, Penn State and Temple allvow topfiglit proposed

By Gwenn ‘Barney
Senior Staff Writer

In the week since Gov. Tom Corbett
proposed a 30 percent cut to Pitt’s
state funding, University officials
said they have taken the ﬁrst steps
toward preventing thatbudget re-
duction. ._ _ .

“Although Pitt has always been

willing to bear its fair share of the -

burden facing the Commonwealth
in establishing the budget, the Uni-
versity does seek recognition of the

role it plays in bettering the lives of .

Pennsylvanians; thus,.we advocate
fair treatment in the budget-build-
ing process,” Pitt spokesman John
Fedele said in an email.

Pitt, along with Temple Uni-

versity and Penn State University,
is facing proposed state funding’

‘ cuts that could drastically reduce

its-state appropriations. While the
schools said they will do their best
not to let the cuts impact tuition,
they haven’t come forward with set
plans on how they will attempt to

get the funding cuts reduced.

Corbett’s $27.4 billion state -
budget proposal for the coming ﬁs-
cal year will slash spending and cut
Pitt’s state funding from $136 mil-

‘ lion to $95.2 million.

Fedele referred to Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg’s recent state-
ment on the issue in discussing
Pitt’s planned response to Corbett’s
proposed funding cuts. _

“Knowing the daunting chal-
lenge that we now face, we need to

 

build uponthe outstanding advoca-

cy efforts undertaken by students,‘

faculty, staff and alumni_during the
budget-building process last year,”

' p Nordenberg said in the statement.

Last year, Corbett originally
proposed a 50 percent reduction in
state funding for Pitt. By the time
the state passed the budget injune,
the cut was reduced to 19 percent,
leaving Pitt with $136 million in

state appropriations, one-ﬁfth of .
~ an allotment less than it received

in 2010.

After last year’s appropriation .
cuts, in—state tuition at Pitt rose‘

8.5 percent, or $1,196, and out-
of—state tuition rose 4 percent, or
$948. University officials are not
sure if a similar increase is in the
cards this year.

‘_‘It is far too early in‘ the appro-
priation and budgeting process to
arrive at tuition calculations,” Fe-
delesaid.

The state needs.to pass its bud-

:get by June 30. In order for that

tofjhappen, the Senate and House
both need to pass a bill, and Cor-
bett has to sign it. The budget the
state passed injune was a compro-
mise between Corbett’s original 50
percent proposal, the Senate’s/ 15
percent cut and the House’s 25 per-
cent ﬁmding—reduction proposal.
Pitt usually waits until the state
passes its budget to announce any
tuition increase. _ - V

sociation Council, the Student Gov-'
ernment Board, the Graduate and

While I am as disturbedas the next college studeAnt facing huge debt
after my graduate social work program, I believe that in these gener-

,ally dreadful times we need to be realistic. Just a quick glance at Gov.

Tom Corbett’s budget cuts brings me to a difficult conclusion: better .
tuition hikes at the college level than cuts to public school education
and human services. If we do not keep people healthy, fed and ade-
quately educated by the time they get out of high school, college will be
a moot point. Obviously, it is not fun or desirable to get a college edu-
cation taking a class or two at a time. Millions have done it, however
—— it is an option, in the way children learning in adequate environ-

ments having had enough to eat is most deﬁnitely -not. Furthermore, ,

equal if not greater pressure needs to be directed at ways to increase
revenue —— with the most glaring examples being increased taxes for
corporations and the wealthy and Marcellus Shale operations. There
are others, if anyone cares to look. A - ‘

Graduate School of Social Work

Columnist

They typically sit in frontof you in class, barrage
‘I your professor with questions and do 80 percent
— of your group.projects. They all suffer from my dis-

ease. That is, I’m another college student afflicted
by the scourge known as ‘iproductivity-obsession,”
and I might have stumbled upon a way to assuage an

- important symptom. .

You might know_ us (disparagingly, perhaps) as
the breed ‘that compulsively evaluates everything
we do based on marginal beneﬁt'—— the ones who
can’t help but max out our academic credits each

- term, carry around ever-morphing to-do lists and
A feel uncomfortable during holidays at the idea of

sitting around and doing nothing (I’m sorry, but
listening to Uncle Charlie’s,failed—but-he—doesn’t-
know—it Christmas dinner jokes doesn’t exactly
make for adequate summer fellowship application

‘ preparation). Oh, and we also tend to have high life

expectations and grade-point averages. - _

At ﬁrst glance, the ‘productivity-obsessed might
seem invincible. The popularity of such a false be-
lief might serve my interest, but? since universities
supposedly pride themselves on truth—telling (ex-
cept when it’s about their budget), I might as well
dish some out. The fact is, allowing for the variabil— A

ity that characterizes human behavior, productivity .
obsession often carries a signiﬁcant negative side 1

effect — our kryptonite if you will: We consentingly
let- our bodies fall into disrepair. s . -

With our eyes ﬁxated on the frontiers of our
individual production possibilities, we ignore the
need to properly maintain the major factor of pro-
duction — our health. Or we recognize the harm
we’re doing and rationalize it. Or we simply don’t
care, If pressed about humans’ ability to live forev-

7 er, we would of course laugh in your face, citing the
_ life expectancy rate and discreditjng Cryogenics,
‘ a but nevertheless we act as if we believe in unlimited

lifespan, at least for ourselves. Pursuing productiv-

. ity day after day, we ﬁll our blood -with stress hor-

mones and leave our muscles atrophying, building
ourselves greater chances to quickly develop major
health problems. Convincing us to do otherwise is
beyond difficult —— but absolutely necessary. -
Implementing a healthy regimen of diet, sleep
and exercise requires the input of energy, thought
and time. The productivity—obsessed are, indeed,

_ capable of utilizing such resources; it’s just that we

ascribe to them a sky-high premium —'— the mar-
ginal productiveness of an extra activity has to
overwhelmingly convince us before we choose to
displace other activities in our packed schedule.
For college students like me, healthy living is a-
hard sell from the marginal productiveness lens.
With theA specters of exams and post-graduation
employment over our heads, the productivity-
obsessed hesitate to subtract from Earth’s manda-
tory 24-hour time budget so as to partake in activi-
ties that don’t seem to directly relate to traditional
measures of success. Unless you’re vying to become
a personal trainer, companies and graduate schools

won’t accept you on the basis of a workout resumé;
they tend to smile at good grades and relevant work

  Exercise consistent with productivity   S

experience. Likewise, for the large idealistic contin-
gent of us hyper—produActive folks, no one ever‘halt~
ed epidemics or overthrew dictators by regulating
. his personal food intake. A ” -

Facing the daily onslaught of collegiate respon-
sibilities, healthy habits often occupy a back-burn-
er against more success-related uses of time, like
studying for that next exam or gathering partici-

pants forthat upcoming club function. Consequent- -

ly, our non-health commitments direct ourhealth

behavior. Given the deﬁnitively irregular nature of V
these non-health commitments, we eat irregularly, i

sleep irregularly and exercise irregularly (if at all).
‘ And society only makes it.worse. The'widely'cir-

culatéd American hero motif is particularly culpa- _
'ble: People by and large hold to high esteem some-

,one who perseveres toward some greater good

through adversity. It makes imposing adversity on .

our bodies, in the hopes'of enhancing productiv-
ity, all the more justiﬁed, and therefore harder to
reverse. ' a ‘ _ - _ —
Yet, through all of this, I’ve recently found.my—
self living healthily (per se). I agree —— it’s a truly
‘ puzzling phenomenon. Despite internal and exter-
nal productivity pressures that had me more or less.
ignore my body_for countless years, the evidence‘ is
undeniable — for weeks now, I’ve been preparing
my own meals, eating them three times a day at reg-
ular intervals and getting between seven and eight

hours of sleep a night, and to my further surprise, .

I went jogging last weekend (with the predictable
out—of-shape hufﬁng and puffing, no doubt). There’s
no saying how long this healthy spell will last, but
at least in the meantime I can comfortably say I’ve
deﬁed the norm for the productivity—obsessed, and
‘ I hope more of my kind can do the same. \

So here’s the prospective symptom “assuager”
you’ve been waiting for. Surely, potential explana-I
tions for my change of habits abound (such as not
having a meal plan and living farther from campus).

But I’d like to think there’s something more sub— 

A stantial in the mix. That is, I_’ve recently been over-
come by a new revelation courtesy of the neurosci-
ence ﬁeld, and the Work of Pitt faculty is partially
responsible. A growing body of research is strongly
suggesting that healthy living -— particularly exer-
cise —— not only signiﬁcantly beneﬁts the functions

of the body (like heart, lungs, liver, etc.), but also of . I

‘the brain. On the one hand, exercise can stimulate
production of new brain cells that aid in memory,
and on_the other it can slow the normal degenera-
tion of brain volume over time. But most cogently,
the evidence asks us to throw out the popular no-
tion —~ to which I had long subscribed —’ that
there’s some distinction between body health and
brain health. In fact, now we know that it’s unrea-

sonable to expect an atrophying body to somehow -

spare the executive. -

And as the . productivity—obsessed intimately
understand, you cannot optimally balance energy,
thought and time without an on—the—ba1l brain. As
a consequence many of us treat our mental endow-
ments as among our most p_rized possessions. It’s
just that we must gain the perspective that, if not
carefully managed with healthy habits, our yearn-
ing for productivity may be self—compromising. I

Don t expect

Jeremy Lin has had an impressive run
for his ﬁrst few starts in the NBA, but
_don’t expect the 23-year-old point guard
to make headlines for much longer.
Yeah, you heard me: “Lin-sanity” is
a ﬂuke, a phase, an anomaly, Tim Tebow
part II, except I’m going to hate him a lot
less when it’s all said and done. '
I get how impressive this kid is. He
was sleeping on teammate Landry
Fields’ couch in New York City two
weeks ago, hoping not to get cut from
the Knicks. And then, magically, he’s
putting up 38 points, seven assists
and four rebounds against the Lakers.
The Knicks have won all ﬁve games
he’s started in.
The numbers show how hot

Lin is personally: In his lastfour games, he

_scoredat least 23 points, recorded at least

seven assists and shotabove 53 percent

from the ﬁeld. Since the 1985 season, only
- 41 players have achieved such a streak, ac- .

cording to basketball—reference.com.

As you’d expect, that list of 41 includes
players like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird,
Magicjohnson and LeBron]ames. But it
also includes ‘names like Derek Harper,
Kenny Smith,jerome “Pooh” Richardson,
jay Humphries and Lionel Simmons, and
four other guys who never made an All-
Star game.

I’m rooting for Lin, but I’m not hold-
ing my breath for him to win champion-

ships, make All-Star games or even start _

next year. There are a few things everyone
has to remember before getting carried
away. . ' ,

First of all, Carmelo Anthony, Amare
Stoudemire and Baron Davis will even-

tually come back. When that happens, _

you betterbelieve a superstar player like
Anthony will want the ball back. In fact,

Davis, who was the Knicks’ starting point A

guard before getting hurt, might simply
walk back into his starting role, if Knicks

like our posts were going to get

coach Mike Diantoni wants him to. Stou-

.demire will demand touches as well, like

he always has.
In another parallel to the Tebow plague
— whichsaw an" underdog quarterback

perform betterthan expected — Lin has .

carried the Knicks over Weak opponents.
Not including the Lakers — who deployed

_ an aging Derek Fischer to cover Lin for 40

minutes — the combined record of the four
teams the Knicks beat is 41-70. _
There is a reason why the Harvard grad

went undrafted and was then waived by -

the Houston Rockets and Golden State
Warriors this year; it’s because he isn’t
that gifted. .

On ESPN’s show First Take, the panel
of analysts also discussed the big elephant
in the room: Lin is Asian. Good Asian
professional basketball players are, in
a word, rare. Yao Ming was the face of
Asian basketball players in the NBA for
a while, but he was also 7’6” and is now

' out of the league.

. As Beto Duran discussed on the show,
_Lin’s race “doesn’t hurt” his publicity, his
hype, and his fame. I think it’s pretty obvi-
ous the fact that he is Asian has made his

Pitt players have realized there’s

“Lin-Sanity,” orfthleNew Yerk”Kniieks,toikeep succeeding

popularity even’ more rampant. People
identify with him because he’s a smart guy
playing with the best athletes around, _he
breaks the stereotype, and he’s a come-
back story. . C . C
' To his credit, and despite the relent-
less media hype, Lin has been nothing but
gracious, humble and hardworking —
which is why I’m rooting for him. He plays
defense. He talks about how the attention
has been “uncomfortable.”,He wants to
share the ball. He’s everything other pro-
fessional basketball players aren’t.
Even though the Knicks schedule-re-
mains soft until March, I still wouldn’t
expect to see Lin hit more than 30 points

again this season. And once their schedule '

ramps up and -there is some footage on
him, deﬁnitely don’t expect teams to let
his abilities slip through their gameplans.
Once he becomes the focus, his numbers
are going to drop. A lot.

For now, whether it is for luck or just
because he has a grasp of reality, Lin said
he’s continued to sleep on Field’s couch,_
and I think that’s a good idea. The “star”
point guard shouldn’t get too far ahead
of himself. I

James Deen discovered porn by the ﬁrst

grade. , L .
Sometime in kindergarten or ﬁrst grade,

he stumbled upon a pile of porn magazines

g behind his school. Naturally curious, h
' ’ picked one up and looked atit. -

‘i{lnd'I said, ‘This is what I want to do. I
‘want to do porn,”’Deen said. _

While many boys might choose grand ca-
reer aspirations and not achieve them, Deen
has. The 26-year-old, born in Pasadena,
Calif, began his porn career. seven" years
ago, and by 2009 he was the youngest man
to be named “Male Performer of the Year” by
Adult Video News. Much of his work appears
on BurningAngelIcom and Kinlccom.

Deen, who has starred in more than

V 4,000 ﬁlms,'is not your stereotypical porn
' star. In his ﬁlms, he gazes into the eyes ofhis

partners, holding their hands. He doesn’t
look like Ron Jeremy. He’s 5-foot-8 and slim
at 150 pounds. He has wavy brown hair,
bright blue eyes and stubble. If a woman
brought him home to show off to her fam-

ily, her father would likely approve at ﬁrst '

glance.

He tweets about burritos and wanting
super powers. He said that he would prefer
to spend a Friday or Saturday night relax-

ing at his San Fernando Valley home with I

lﬁ-iends rather than partying at a club.

4 And this is how he’s generated such a
massive following of adoring fans.

When I called him last month, Deen was

in thelmiddle ofshooting a porn. But after

‘ he arrived back home, he pulled away from .

his friends to talk about how he loves his job,
how sex is awesome and how communica-
tion — not making love like a porn star -— is
key to great sex.

The Pitt News: In a YouTube video of an

interview from when you were 19 [Deeni
“Oh, God, I hate that video. I just want to

go back and punch myself in the face.”] , you r
I. said you were in the industry for the money, V .
but you wouldn’t mind it if you became fa-

mous. At 26, you’ve gained signiﬁcant atten-
tion and popularity. How do you feel about
how far you’ve advanced? ‘

  llp-and-coming porn star talks industry, oral sex and whatwomen want  

James Deen: Let me rephrase that, be-
cause I still have the same philosophy, but
I’m less arrogant. This is something that
I truly love and stand behind. Becoming
famous was not a priority, it was something
that I wanted to turn into a career and have
a good time and be good and successful at
it. ' V ‘

I would only want more fame if it meant

creating more demand and more job op- ‘

portunities. But‘I’m in porn because it’s my
career, my job. I love it. If I wanted to go into
taxidermy, and people said, “Well, do you
wantto be the most famous taxidermist?”

,I’d say, “No, I just really lovetaxidermy.”

'TPN: You’re carved a niche for yourself ‘

in the pornindustry by being the guy who
doesn’t look like the stereotypical male'ac-
tor. How doyou respond to people crediting
your success to your appearance? ‘

JD: It doesn’t bother me, but it’s not
something that I particularly want to‘ be
known for. Peopleknow me for being good
at my job - or for mylooks, [and].,then

_ [see] that I’m good‘ at my job.

I think now there’ tends to be more ev-
eryday-looking guys entering the industry. I

don’t really think I paved the way, but more .

of-a timing thing. When I ﬁrst got into porn,

the boat ?Men-measureup 

By Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Senior Steve Carroll recounted the preado—

_lescence days when he and his buddies took a

good ol’ ruler to their man parts to size up.
“‘At this age, I don’t think we really com-
pare dicks anymore,” he said. “It was a thing
we all used to do in middle school  Middle
school was the dick comparison age.”

But sex experts say that the age of penis
comparison spansfar longer than the days
of school dances, braces and newly sprouted
pubic hair. And for some, a penis that doesn’t
size up can bring on heavy doses of anxiety
and low conﬁdence. .

“It’s across the. board, through all ages
 Because if they have the idea of penis size
when they’re young, why

   

mightvhave emasculated  man with th 

barely bulging bump in  pants. ~ _ I y

pedestal-  »   '

“I think that anxietyi _ ,

But Granzig disagrees. I .

Granzig, who has taught sexology in

   
  
  
 

lChina,p»§er_many and India, said that even

 pl  here the government. keeps a_
big concern. .

In some Polynesian and African tribes,
menwear horns as penis sheaths. Granzig

said the horns do

not directly cor-

ers’ penis sizes but
still signify who’s_
in power.

“Oh, you’re
the king because
you have a longer
horn,” Granzig

the average erect penis ' -

measures about six to six and a half inches,
whereas a small penis is characterized by
a three- to four-inch erect shaft. The rare
micropenis is one inch or smaller in length.
Granzig said that penis size is directly re-

, lated to the amount of testosterone a fetus

receives while still in the uterus.

_ _ “No guy really ever thinks his penis is too .
A big; it’s always too small  It’s a real interest-

ing thing because it’s almost like sport. In
other words, whoever has the biggest penis
wins,” Granzig said..

The vagina can adapt to various penis
sizes, and Granzig said it can accommodate
a penis of mpre than seven inches, But if a
penis is too big, it can hit the uterus.

Jennifer Bass, the director of communi-
cations at the Kinsey Institute for Research.
in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana
University, said that the institute often re-
ceives letters and phone calls from men hung
up on the size of their penis. V

_“The number one question is, ‘How can
I enlarge my penis?’ and the number two is,
‘Am I normal?’” she said.

- Bass said the anxiety that comes with
the fear of being labeled “small” parallels
the anxiety people have about their body
image overall: /

“People have anxieties about all kinds of
things that are related to their bodies, and
it is unfortunate but  it does inhibit a lot
of people. And it creates anxiety for men,
especially young men who are just becoming
sexually active,” she said.

Bass and Carroll both believe the media

said. “They cer-
tainly wouldn’t be affected by .the media.”
But what about the partner that ‘gets to
receive the penis? - ‘ l
' Drsl Kevan Wylie and Ian Eardley pub-

— lished “Penile size and the ‘small penis syn-

drome,’” in 2006 based. on their ﬁndings

from an Internet survey distributed to 52,031

heterosexual men and women‘. . ,, -

The survey found that while about 85
percent of women reported feeling satisﬁed
with the size ‘of their partner’s penis, only
about 55 percent of men were satisﬁed with
the size of their package, and 44 percent
wanted to _be larger. in ‘

I “The issue of attractiveness to women is
complex, but most data suggest that penile
size is much lower down the list of priori-
ties for women than such issues as_ a,man’s
personality and external grooming,” the
study said. -

Bass said that regardless of a homosexual
or heterosexual relationship, partners do
not fret over size. I

“The most important organ is your
brain,”'she said. - -

Sophomore Kelsey Martin said that she
picks a guy on a number of qualities — per-
sonality, intelligence, likability — none of
the criteria related-to body-part length.

“Penis size doesn’t matter,” she said.

Though the importance of penis size re-
mains up for debate, one thing’s for certain:
Few wish to shrink their member.

“If you want to have a losing medical
practice, advertise penis reduction,” Gran-
zig said. I

How to survive Valentine’

By Sarah Reagle
Columnist

A lot of people think-Valentine’s Day is the
worst day of the? year. It’s in the middle of
everyone’s least favorite month. It basically
forces you to consume 10 times more choco-
late than you would otherwise. And whatever
genuine 'rox=_nantic sentiment was once associ-

ated with the holiday has since been erased by g ’

heart-shaped jewelry, red roses and the ever-
hated Hallmark company. "

Most of the people who maintain this posi-
tion, however, are single. But 'Valentine’s.'Day
doesn’t have to be the worst day of the year —
even if you aren’t halfof a couple. I assure you
thatfvebeen single for the vast majoritybf the
Valentine’s Days in my life, but there are still
some things I’llalways like about the holiday.
I love candy in the shape of hearts. I generally
like the color pink. And I’m unrepentantly in
love with the movie “Valentine’s Day.”

I’m here to propose a few things you can
do to hate Valentine’s Day a little less if you’re
single —_or at least a few things to distract
you for the day. '

If you have single friends:

Gather them. Anyone who’s ever been to a_

high school dance knows that supposed cou-
ples’ events are more ﬁm°if you’re accompa-

' ironic pink cock-

nied by friends rather than a signiﬁcant other.

The same holds true for Valentine’s ‘Day. For -

couples, it’s a lot of pressure. For friends, it’s
an excuse to ignore your work and do some-

thingfun together. I g missed connections ~
Potential activi- ‘  ’ _ on Craigslist and
ties are endless. Eat baking. Everyone

candy and watch other who can bake
somerom coms. Go well, so-this will just

sing sad breakup‘
songs at a karaoke

bar. Dance around - ‘
to ' “Single Ladies”
or f‘99_ Problems.”
Drink some ‘semi-

tails. Do whatever

enjoy "food with friends, cook at home.‘

B‘y Megan Trimble
Staﬁ” Writer

Will Benham found himself facing public
harassment late one night while walking
home from a friend’s house in South

T Oakland.

' Jeers from a man in a passing car H‘

_ came as a result of the Pitt junior’s deci-

sion to hold his boyfriend’s hand.

‘.‘We literally-held hands for two
seconds, and someone at the stop sign
behind us yelled ‘Gay!’ and then, ‘Why-
are you holding handsf?!” Benham said.
“This man in the car, though, clearly
didn’t look like a Pitt student, so maybe
that says something about Pittsburgh 
general.’-’ A A ’

Pitt is often mentioned among top

— colleges in terms of academics, athlet-

ics and_student life, but in the LGBTQ—
friendly category, the University falls
noticeably short.

Pitt Rainbow Alliance President

. Tricia Dougherty said it is not surpris-

ing that Pitt is overlooked by publica-
tions such as Newsweek, the Campus’
Climate _Index '

sion to its nondiscrimination policy.
But other University policies, such as
the housing policy for transgendered
students, remain unchanged.
Dougherty cited the University’s

housing policy’s refusal to accommodate»

transgendered students asla clear con- *-
ﬂict that adds to Pitt’s absence among‘

the LGBTQ—friendly rankings of compa-'
rable institutions such as the University

‘of Pennsylvania and Penn State, New

York and Stanford universities.

The‘se universities receive high
rankings on the basis of LGBTQ policy ‘
inclusion, support and institutional ,
commitment, a category th lo ks _at ,-
university resources dedica . é  
group, academic life, student life, hous-
ing and residence life, campus safety,
counseling and health and targeted
LGBTQ student recruitment. ,

' Dougherty said that Pitt isolates.
transgendered.stuclents in single rooms
on Lothrop Hall, which she said isone
of the most expensive dorms on campus.

“Schools of Pitt’s caliber generally . V
have a policy in place that ifit is not
gender, neutral at least accommodates
transgendered students. These schools

designated LGBTQ

While the limi-
tations in policies

completed the

said. “Pitt is really lagging behind on
LGBTQ issues,_ especially for a school of
its size and ranking.” . '
A To the Rainbow Alliance, LGBTQ—’
friendly means aneducated awareness
of the issues facing the lesbian—gay- _'
transgendered—queer—and—allied com-
munity and the establishment of effec-
tive policies to protect the members of -
the community. ' . A
“The needs of only_ some of the ac-
ronym are being met,” Dougherty said.

h“_Pitt could possibly be characterized

as gay-friendly, but not all, and it has a
long way to go to be friendly to trans- '
gendered students.”

- In 2008, Pitt added sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity and gender expres-

“From my experience as the As-

to the Rainbow Alliance, we do what

we can to ensure a hospitable camp_us‘
environment for students of all sexual
orientations,” Shawn Brooks, the as-

’ sociate dean of students and directorof

residence life, said in an email.
He said that .University resources for

include the Ofﬁce of Diversity, Afﬁrma—

FROM PAGE 16

a lot of the guys were big and buff and ma-
chismo, and when I came in, people were
like, “Well, we’ll give him a shot.”

TPN: A recent Nielsen rating says one
out of every three women is watching In-
ternet porn, more than half of men watch
porn, and a University of Montreal study

I couldn’t ﬁnd a single man in his 20s who

hadn’t watched porn. What’s your response

I to these statistics?

JD: I think it’s great. I think as time goes
on, people will feel less sexually repressed
and more comfortable with different things.
I think the ‘idea that women can be in porn,
watch porn, be into porn is great, and men
not being embarrassed will be a more natu-
ral thing. There’s this primal thing where
sex is just for procreation. No, it’s not. Sex
is awesome. It’s awesome and feels good.

V It’s fun.

TPN: Is it fair to say you don’t give a lot
of oral sex in your ﬁlms? That doesn’t seem
to be something prominent in porn. Do you
think that’s an accurate representation of
sex or is that something you would like to
see change?

JD: I’ve done it before, and there are guys
who do it. It depends on the scene and the
cameras. As far as when I do it, I’m all about
it. ‘ . '

Statistically, the people higher up and the
directors say the viewers aren’t as into it. But
there are some directors who say, “OK, you
two go downon one another, then have sex.”

A director may say you can do whatever you '

want, and there’s a lot of scenes of vagina-
licking and it’s awesome. , '
The scene is about the girl, and some
directors just don’t know how to shoot it
because it’s all so technical. And I do think
it gives an unrealistic depiction of what sex
should be in real life. Oral sexiis great for
both guys and girls. It’s f*ckin’ awesome.

TPN: College is a-time°oflearning'. Do you
think porn can help a sexual relationship or
hinder it? Some say it gives men unrealistic
expectations of women, not to mention that

they wear themselves out after wanking for

so long.

JD: I would say that’s stupid. If a guy is
jerking off because he’s horny then can’t
have sex later, it’s not because he’s tired,
it’s because he’s not able to fulﬁll a certain

fantasy brought by his partner.

I had a friend call me with that problem,
and I asked how long they’d been together,
and she said six years. And I said that chanc-
es are he wants athreesome or he wants to
bang it in the butt. Some people are into
weird things, too. He’s probably faithful to
her while jerking off because they’ve been
together sixwyears, but maybe he’s just a little
bored. —

Two, about unrealistic expectations of
women. The world gives unrealistic expecta-
tions of women. I’ve been in porn for a long
time, and there are some gorgeous girls in
porn. But there are girls just as beautiful as
the girls who are the actresses in porn.

I don’t think people can argue that porn
gives unrealistic expectation when the media
does in magazines. If anything, porn helps
with creating realistic expectations by pre-
senting what certain things girls can be into.
It can show how to communicate between
partners about what they’re into.

- TPN: How has being in the porn industry
affected your ability to develop relation-
ships? Has it helped or ruined your sex
life? ‘ ‘

JD: It hasn’t hurt it at all. If anything, it’s
made it better, because before, I’d always
been a gigantic slut, but now I say, “I’m not
just going to have sex with you. _I’m going
to have sex with other people.” It’s just very
honest and clear. As long as everything is
honest and open, you can still have your
romantic love—making, if you will. I’ve never
had the experience where I have sex and
say, “Oh my God, this is so boring, it’s just

' like work.”

TPN: So you direct ﬁlms, too. Are you
hoping to expand on that in the future into
something bigger?

JD: It’s more of a side project now. But

when I’m done doing porn or I just get tired, '

I would like to go into directing more. The
reason I haven’t done morewitli it now is
because performing is way more fun, and
I want to continue to have fun at what I’m
doing.

‘ TPN: Do you have any tips for guys want-
ing to improve their skills?

JD: Mybiggest tip for everybody is commu-
nication, for both guys and girls. Statistically,
as far as I understand, most women don’t want
to have 45 minutes of sex. Five or six minutes
is enough. They don’t need hours and hours
of guys pounding away on them, where they
might not even c*m from that. So communi-
cate. She might even want something else. I

The Office of Cross-Cultural Leader-
ship and Development can also help to
advocate for students faced with intoler-

ance.

Workshops that educate and train
individuals interested in gaining a bet-
ter understanding of LGBTQ-issues and

playing a role in creating an inclusive

environment are offered through these
resources. The workshops are known as

» Allies Training. ,
“We are proactive in communicating‘

to our entire campus community the

value of diversity and inclusion, and I ' ‘

believe that our students, faculty and

‘ staff have very positive attitudes toward

those who_ are different than they are,
whether it is sexual orientation,‘ race, 4
religion or whatever,” Brooks said.

‘V The Rainbow Alliance offers ofﬁce
hours for students_and solzial outlets
such asiweekly lounge nights on Wednes-
days and Thursday night meetings.‘

. ' Dougherty said that the meetings
range in topicbut feature social justice

f trainings, discussions, speakers and the

group’s annual drag show fundraiser for
the Pittsburgh AIDS Task_ Force.

‘Brooks’ and Dougherty agreed that
speaking out about intolerance is crucial
to making a change. -

Director of the University Counseling
Center Te'vya Zukor said in an email that
he has not seen a student seek counsel- _
_ing for harassment or intolerance since _
coming to Pitt in September. ’

Dougherty said that her experience
advocating to other student organiza-
tions has been,“overwhelmingly__posi-
tive,” but that divisions still exist be-
tween the LGBTQ community, students .
and ‘administration. . "I

‘ “It. is extremely difﬁcult to make‘
headway on including transgender
students in Pitt’s housing policy. It is V
a challenge getting people to listen,”
Dougherty said. “We still have a long

way to go in orderto be fully supported

by the administration.”

Student experiences at Pitt fall on a/
spectrum, but Dougherty said that trans-
gendered and gender—nonconforming
students have a much harder time.’ -

“I have heard of students who were
questioned if they were in the correct,

-bathroom,” Dougherty said. ._ ‘
Freshman Alysse Berry said that Pitt
‘ has no need to feel overly worried about

its lack of ranking. . p
“Yeah, sure it would be nice to have ‘

a higher ranking, but I think we’re real-

istic,” she said. “Pitt is diverse. We’ll ac-

cept-you’ifyou’re different, but we might

not be the most tolerant out there.” '
Benham agreed that, whether or not

Pitt is seen as LGBTQ-friendly, one must

be realistic when viewing the issue.
“Overall, I‘feel that Pitt’s campus is

gay friendly, but therefs always those as-

sholes in the world,” Benham said; I ‘

You: Hey dude, remember that time
I puked all over the place, and there

it up for a few months, and I kept step-
ping in the puke, and you thought it
