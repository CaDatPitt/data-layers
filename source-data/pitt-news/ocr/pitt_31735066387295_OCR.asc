Verdict on all—ages club
could be revealed soon

By Brenda McGuirk

Staff Writer

Besides the under-21 and all-
ages shows at Graffiti and the U p-
stage, most Pitt students under 21
years of age have nowhere to go
to listen to bands and dance
without worrying about being

carded or fined by the LCB. v

Student Government Board
member Melanie Naro is current-
ly working with the Student Ac-
tivities Office to create an all-ages
nightclub on the Pitt campus as
an alternative to going to local
bars and clubs. . »

The nightclub would be open
to all Pitt students regardless of
their age. Naro said she would
like to have it in the Concourse
of the William Pitt -Union on
weekend nights.

Pitt's Student Government
Board met Friday to announce its
agenda for the rest of the term.

Among the plans SGB Presi-
dent Phil Moyer hopes to execute
are a campus-wide crime watch,
a taxi service for students, news-

letters for all student organiza— '

tions and the student's

on-campus phone directory»
Moyer said he was still in con-

tact with campuspolice to help

getting strict, and there's really
nothing else to do in Oakland, I
think this would be a goodvplace
for students to get together," said
Naro. ’’I’d like to get local bands
such as the Affordable Floors,
Hector in Paris and the Spuds to
play thereand draw students to
the club.”

Although students over 21 will
be allowed in the club, no alco-
hol will be served or allowed on
the premises.

The question of whether Pitt
students will go to a club where
alcohol is not allowed was asked
last year in a phone survey con-
ducted by the SGB. A majority of
the students surveyed thought the
club was a good idea and said
they would go_ even if alcohol
was not served.

Some students said they
wouldn't be drawn to the dry

SGB proposes taxi

set up the crime watch which will
cover the Pitt campus. The crime
watch is hoped to alleviate street
dangers.

SGB member George Kontos
has proposed a Student Taxi Serv-
ice. The service would cover the
entire campus, from 10 pm. to
2:30 a.m. Monday through
Thursday and-from 10 p.m. to 1
a.m. Fridays and Saturdays.

”Students will be able to catch
the taxi in front of Hillman
Library,” Kontos said, ”which

will be its central location when 1

club even if live bands played
there. Amy Verdoni, ‘a 20-year-
old junior, said ’’I wouldn't go to
it because there wouldn't be any-
thing to drink, and I wouldn't go
to see the bands."

According to some, under-age‘
clubs do work in some places;

Carnegie Mellon’s Scotland Yard '

is a very popular ‘place to go on
campus. Naro is planning on talk-
ing to the students who run the
club to get some ideas on how to
make Pitt's proposed club suc-
cessful. .

Naro hopes to have the club

open in time. for Homecoming ,

and to have it open after the pa-
rade. ’’I’d like to see it be the
place to go after the Homecom-
ing events,” ‘said Naro.

So far there is nothing definite
on paper. ”We have to get the

Kontos added, ”The board [is
proposing] that the university
make a contract with a local cab
company for a fixed hourly rate
that will be charged regardless of
the number of students who use
the taxi.”

Moyer hasappointed Kontos to
a neighborhood task force on
landlords. ”[We hope to see] how
students can be involved in the
protection, of the campus and of
the neighborhood,” said’ Moyer.

Crowd less than  is
expected for pope .

By Victor L. Simpson

Associated Press Writer

Blame it on theiweather, television or because it's the second
time, but Pope John Paul ll’s pilgrimage is drawing smaller-than-
anticipated crowds. '

The pope, however, can take some consolation as protests . i

that were threatened for each of his stops have been tiny." ,

For the fourth day in a row Sunday, the crowds coming out
to see the pope on his second tour of the United States were
smaller than organizers had hoped.‘ '

An estimated 300,000 people attended John Paul's open-air ‘
Mass in San Antonio, Texas, the fourth stop in his nine—city pil-

grimage. That was the largest crowd yet to see him so far this
trip, but far fewer than the half-million organizers had hoped for.
The papal tour has been bedeviled by the weather since the
start. Even in San Antonio, where skies were clear Sunday, bad
weather had left its mark last week when a windstorm toppled
two 21-story towers erected as part of the altar for the Mass.
in Miami, for the first time on one ofjohn Pau|’s 36 foreign
trips, worshippers were sent home during a Mass. This hap-’
pened Friday when the Secret -Service advised that winds and
lightning during a thunderstorm posed a potential hazard to the
people gathered in Tamiami Park. .
Attendance at the Miami Mass was officially estimated at
250,000, but The Miami Herald reported Saturday that 150,000

was a more realistic figure, based on analysisgof aerial photos -

and detailed grids.
Later Friday, crowds were sparse along the pope's route

through Columbia, S.C., where city officials had braced ‘for ’

250,000 visitors. A
City officials said Saturday that the total turnout was about
100,000, counting some 60,000 who attended an ecumenical
prayer service at the University of South -Carolina stadium.
The bad weather kept up Saturday in New Orleans, where
a thunderstorm drenched 150,000 people awaiting the pope's
arrivalto celebrate Mass. _ ,
Organ_izers had hoped as many as 277,000 would turn out
for the Mass at the University of New Orleans, but Tom Fin-

ney, spokesman for the New Orleans archdiocese, said church ‘

officials were not disappointed.

”Numbers are not as important as the spirit that wasicap-A. '

tured,” he said. » ‘ _

Health club owners

PITTSBURGH — The Pennsyl-

partnership units in the club.

Charged were Sanford Wedner
of Pittsburgh, Irwin B. Wedner, a
Pittsburgh attorney, and Frank

Verderame of New York. They
are accused of selling partnership
interests in the Downtown Rac-
quet and Athletic Club to 17 peo-
ple and groups for about $1.18
million between 1978 and 1985,
commission officials said.

The commission also charged
the men with omitting names of

James Egler, attorney in charge of

office.

City flows freely at tailgate
parties. «

Like the Pitt football program,
tailgating has a tradition of its
own. Partiers gather at parking
lots throughout Oakland, with
the largest crowds near the Syria

Mosque. The serious tailgater will ‘

arrive at 9 a.m. to set up shop.
Spirit seemed to be high due to
the warm weather and cold

-drinks. Some fans go all out for

the tailgate like Tom_Conley and
Jim Boston. They brought grills
and cooked hot dogs. However,
they didn't have the problem of

V ”too many cooks ...” .

”Tom’s in charge of the

Students Dunlap, Sue Simon and
Dave Conley were enjoying the
party, but Conley thought the
mood was casual. To remedy

The fans around him responded
enthusiastically -

gold in their hair, and a few fa-
natics had painted their faces in
the school colors.

Regardless of what was served

.or who was wearing what, the

consensus was that Pitt would
cream N.C. State. In fact, many
of the partiers were so sure of this
fact that they already had plans
for the victory parties.

The tailgaters were friendly

with their neighboring partiers,‘

offering drinks to passersby and
comparing pregame predictions.

”The best part of tailgating is
the people you meet,” said fresh-
man Laurie Palumbo. The stu-
dents reported that even those
who had graduated from Pitt
came back to tailgate with their
friends when the ‘new season
started.

In spite of the rain shower

around noon, the partiers still had
a full hour to wind down and get
to the stadium. There were a few
grumblers , but the grumbling
wasn't enough to disband the
parties.

Schlegel said.

they started to pack up and begin ' ’

Others, if they were lucky, caught

the students departed. The tail-‘ '

Of the pope and

other celebrities

PopeJohn Paul II has embarked again to heal the ailing flock
of American Catholics. Since the beginning of his stay, poor
turnouts and bad weather have slowed the momentum of the
visit. '

It seems that the pope has fallen prey to the pop conscious-
ness of America and become nothing more than a symbol of
abygone time. Repeatedly, American Catholic leaders have
said that they respect him as a cleric, but are comfortable in
breaking with the doctrines of the Vatican. ‘ '

To most of us, viewing the papal visit on television, being
shown brief shots _of a man in white behind a bullet-proof shield,
hearing excerpts from shortened speeches, he represents noth-

ing so much as another group divided in its politics.

His message, a valuable and needed oneof peace, falls on
ears numbed with repeated rhetoric, people needing more than

- the sound of distant trumpets to bring order to the social mad-

ness in which they find themselves.
None of this is to say that there is nothing of worth to be
gained from the pope's tourtof the United States. There seems

‘V 2 to have been some truly productive dialogue between the pope

and church leaders. However, a commitment to the pope's

' dream more personal than a pair of jeweled boots is needed
‘ to cross the wasteland between ideals and reality.

Hope for another

way to have fun

The question of an under—2l nightclub on campus has been

‘ raised within the Student Government. At the present, although

nothing definite has been ”put on paper,” members of the SGB

it are projecting an opening date to coincide with the Homecom-..

ing parade.

To have access to the live music in Pittsburgh, an underage
student now must have either a counterfeit ID or a friend at
the door.

The proposed non-alcoholic nightclub in the Student Union
is an idea deserving the full support of the student body. Not
only would it provide a place for students to go in the even-
ings, it would open a new forum for live music. ’

It would be refreshing to see a place on campus where little-

‘  known bands and performers could have a chance to be seen.

Because it would not be an economically motivated venture,
such a club would be free of some of the stifling restrictions
the pursuit of profit places on an establishment.

With the support and patronage of the student body, an
alcohol-free club could at last provide many Pitt students with
the opportunity to discover music that would otherwise go un-
noﬁced.

alt should not be the aim of the SGB to attempt to copy the
environment of a bar, sans alcohol, and to promote the idea
along those lines. A bar derives some, possibly most, of its ap-
peal from the availability of alcohol. A nightclub such as the
one proposed would be by necessity of a different nature, and‘
should be touted as an alternative for all students, not just as
a replacement of the bar scenefor those students not old enough
to drink. An enjoyable evening can come from places other

‘ than the inside of a bottle, and the SGB is to be commended

‘ - for its efforts in that direction.

\ ’/

For the first time in American
political history, the public, and
more specifically the media, is
faced with the question of where
our prejudices actually lie.

For the first time, there is a seri-
ous contender for the office of
president who happens to be
black. T

Sadly, it hasonly been within
the last two or three decades that
equality for all people has been
a serious issue in our govern-
ment, and we are still a long way
from even a passable situation.

Jesse Jackson raises some in-
teresting questions besides those
in his campaign rhetoric. He has
forced Americans to consider
their own prejudices.

‘As we make decisions about
the relative merits of each of the
canidates, we must simultaneous-
ly examine our motivations for
those decisions. We must be sure
at every step of the way that our
opinions are being molded only
by the relevant information
(which the color of a person's
skin is not) and not by the des-
tructive biases passed to us by
less compassionate generations.

‘True, it is never possible to be
completely objective with your-
self. For a person not actively in-

volved in the public exchange of

A ideas, that barrier does not_neces—

sarily lead to problems.

But, for a person responsible ~

for any of the content of public
media, be it television, radio or
print, a lack of objectivity, com-
bined with a-closed mind, be-
comes a tool capable ..of
producing huge, misunder-
standings.

Criticism of the process of in-
formation exchange in the media
is the single most important ingre-
dient for the realization of our
dreams of equality. So long as
any person feels the need to

 

The light remains hooded

speak out against the way ideas
are being represented, the way
views are being expressed, equal-
ity and tolerance remain un-
achieved goals.

Jesse Jackson, by choosing to

enter the race for president, has .

presented the public with a test

‘of its real commitment to the

equality so many profess to
defend.

He has made us question
whether a person can have
pledged loyalty first to the serv-
ice of a specific church and still
be-qualified as a leader within a
democracy. -'

He has opened debate over the
direction our domestic policies
should take.

And, he has given each of us a
chance to make our country a
better place to live.

Because of his standing among

the Democratic hopefuls, we _

have no alternative but to con-

front our own value systems. For '

many in the media, myself in-
cluded, that confrontation has

shown some discrepancies be-

tween the values we wish to em-
brace and those we appear to
embrace.

Matthew Thornton is the per-
spective editor for The Pitt News.

In defense of Judge Bork

A response needs to be made
to the ”complaint” filed in this
paper Sept. 9 by Patricia Mueller
regarding the nomination of
Robert Bork to the Supreme
Court. if the American public
were my clients, I'd ask for a
demurrer on all counts. Not only
does the ’’plaintiff’’ lack a cause
for action, the American public
has no ”cause for concern.”

The plaintiff, Mueller, main-
tains that the Court’s past liberal
majority ”interpreted the consti-
tution in such a way to give many
of us the rights we now take for
granted.” One of these rights she
mentions is the right to use con-
traceptives. Since this is so, we
should ask why a ”liberal-” court
would rule in favor of prenatal in-
fanticide (this phrase is not a con-
tradiction to many of us)? Was
this a convenient way of restor-
ing a right to privacy? [...]

What Mueller fails to mention

LETTERS

are some of the other legacies left
over from the tenure of a liberal
court: the overliberalization of
criminal legal procedures which
allows many criminals to go free
on technicalities, a further
diminishing of personal and real
private property rights (see Ep-
stein, Takings), and a policy of
reverse discrimination (cloaked
as Affirmative Action) which in-
stills an unneeded resentment in
many Americans toward many
minority groups truly deserving
equal opportunity. _
Judge Bork’s confirmation can
only help in striking a true
balance away from the past liber-
al decisions that have upset many

Americans, the same Americans

who overwhelmingly ' elected
Judge Bork’s nominator in the

past two presidential elections.
As for Judge Bork’s qualifica-
tions, Joseph Biden himself said
several months ago that Bork was
an excellent jurist, more than
qualified to sit on the court. Now
it appears that Biden is against
Bork for ideological reasons. It
seems that Biden is more con-
cerned with appeasing the radi-
cal left than seeing to it that we
appoint excellent jurists to the
highest court in the land. .
Finally, Judge Bork maintains,
correctly I might add, that it is the
responsibility of the legislature to
make the law, not the judiciary.
Therefore, the confirmation of
Judge Bork will put the burden of
deciding social policies more

squarely on the shoulders of our‘

elected officia|s,_where it
belongs.

A review of John Paul and the church-rockers

Pope John Paul II: The 1987
U.S. Tour. Sounds to me like this
man needs an opening act. Judas
Priest would be my first choice.
But from what I understand, he's
relying on his steady back—up,
The Saints, to pack the houses.

The Saints are probably the
most experienced» help you can
book these days. They've backed
up previous incarnations of those
who've toured using the Pope
I.D. And now that the Catholic
church has lessened the manda-
tory number of documented
miracles from four to two in ord-
er to be inducted into this presti-
gious, religious hall of fame, I
figure the group will soon be ad-
ding a few new members to its
ranks.

Headlining for The Saints, I ex-
pect, will be one of the only three
canonized Americans, Mother
Elizabeth Seton.

Word has it that the main-
ecumenical-man asked for
Madonna (it must have been the
name), but I think she thinks he
should be her opening act.

Not since Elvis has the world
gone so doggone ga-ga over one
man who can't even sing.

But the reviews are raving for
the new ”King of R&R” (Religion
and Repentance):

Pope John Paul asked everyone
to join forces to ”alleviate eco-
nomic, social and personal
suffering”.

Catholic Charities USA.

I don't think anyone’s called for
that since Bob Geldof. But this
isn’t it  ~

”The 4,500 people allowed to
wait in reserved areas in a corn-
er of the airport had been re-
quired to pass one by one
through metal detectors. Those
who brought little paper flags on
wooden sticks had to tear them
off and leave the sticks behind.
The temperature was in the 90s,
and there were only fleecy clouds
in the sky, affording no relief from
the sun.”

Will anyone remember the
Beatles’ airport reception after
this?

I celebrated a birthday recent-
ly. But this time around, sand-
wiched between the usual

_ reminiscences and banter with

family and friends, was an odd
sense of loss. I learned that my

be high school baseball coach had

taken his life.

It's not that I was close to him.
In fact, my dealings withhim
were, at best, casual. Neverthe-
less, his suicide felt, in some way,
terribly significant. In the month
that passed since I learned of it,
I have been trying to figure out
why. .

I try not to play mind games
with myself. You know, like
when a relative dies and you feel
guilty because you feel nothing
and then get confused by the
blubbering of people who spoke
to the deceased only twice in the
past 20 years.

I realize there is no reason for
me to feel bad about-what coach

did. People do these things every _
‘ day. Suicides supply friends and

acquaintances with excuses for
calling on people whom they've
long neglected to chat with about
how sad it all is.’ If suicides ac-
complish anything at all, that's it.

Why does the whole thing
bother me so much? It seems that
violence and despair are becom-

ing more immediate cond“i_tions., .-
Up untilearly this year; I was still] 

 

one person removed from the
reality of suicide. ,

For a time during college, Ihad
lived and become friendly with
one of R.”Bud” Dwyer's future
assistants who, earlier this year,
had the grave misfortune of bear-
ing witness to the ex—state treas-
urer’s last performance, in
person. Today, thanks to coach,
the whole ugly concept of the
gun’barre| in the mouth is one
step‘ closer to me.

Perhaps it's just that I'm getting
older and theprotective shell
around me is being worn away
by too many acquaintances from
too many backgrounds with too
many problems. Consider the

AIDS crisis, to which, this year,’

I have moved a bit closer as well.
A friend of a friend has suc-
cumbed to the disease. What will
it be next year? One of my
friends? Loved ones? Me?
During the last weekend in

April, a buddy and I were stroIl- -

ing through the Oakland section
of Pittsburgh, near the Pitt book-
store, when we were assaulted by
five youths. We got away without

. too much damage and, as I laid

in bed that evening, nursing a
sore jaw and rather large knot on
my head, I thought" to myself,

People are getting hurt.

Maybe it's because of the
breakdown of the American fami-

ethical and moral standards.
Maybe the media, me included,
are guilty of too much doom-

Perhaps it's the ”shrinking pie”

the problem is much broader in

The problem, as I see it, is the
pace of our world. Everything
moves and changes so quickly —
knowledge, style, technology.
The rampant pursuit of pleasure
contributes to the overall confu-
sion, as does the unbridled desire
for more and better.

And, as the world spins faster

" WASHINGTON — Richard V. Secord

has closed his office, effectively ended his
business with Iran-Contra moneyman Al-

cording to sources familiar with his
situation.

Secord, 55, a retired Air Force major
general who played a principal part in the
Iran-Contra case, is one of the targets of
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's
investigation.

Although he has given a few speeches,
Secord is ”not a hot property” on the lec-

Secord didn't get paid for the long in-

’ terview in the October edition ofPlayboy,

according to journalist Morgan Strong
who conducted the interview.

Secord and Hakim, his former business
partner at Stanford Technology Trading
Group International, handled logistical
and operational details of the program to
sell U.S.—made weapons to Iran and divert
the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.

They reported to Lt. Col. Oliver L.

Before they became linked to North in

selling weapons at a profit.

UN head on peace mission
to the Middle East and Iraq

BAGHDAD, Iraq — U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar took his
peace mission to Iraq after Iran's president

told him Sunday that Iran will keep fight— I

Earlier in the day, Iraq threatened what
one official called a ”more severe war"
unless Iran accepts the U.N. Security
Council's July 20 resolution demanding
a cease—fire in the 7-year-old war.

Iran says the war began when Iraq in-

the conflict broke out two weeks earlier
when Iran shelled border towns.

The agency said the communist govern-

the prisoners already were freed.

Among those granted amnesty were
480 military and civilian personnel of the

Pitt enters waste—control pact with Netherland

As a society, the United States
is more environmentally oriented
than it has been in the past.

Although hazardous waste has
been creating problems United
States for over a decade, it's only
been during the past decade that
the publics’ newly found interest
has made any impact on the
problem.

This growing awareness of the
effects of waste material has
forced the government into deal-
ing more directly with the
problem. The public is not only
asking questions but demanding
answers.

The government has been mak-
ing decisions that will answer the
questions: ”Where can we di-
spose of these potentially danger—
ous materials and waste and
ensure public safety? If a spill oc-
curs, does the county or city have
the necessary facilities to clean
the spill properly? Will the pub-
lic be warned immediately and
provided with emergency in-
structions?”

The University of Pittsburgh's

A Center for Hazardous Materials

Research has taken steps towards
preventing and eventually solving
the many problems associated
with the handling of hazardous

materials and waste.

Samuel A. Schulhof, CHMR
president, met with leaders of the
prestigious Netherlands Organi-
zation for Applied Scientific
Research (TNO) Thursday, Sept.
10 to sign a two-year agreement.

The agreement was designed to
develop and apply innovative
technologies that will help solve
the hazardous waste problem in
the United States

Shulhof said, ”CHMR was at-
tracted to this partnership be-
cause the Netherlands have
limited land area, high popula-
tion density, and concentrated in-
dustrial and agricultural base has
led TNO scientists to develop
very creative solutions to their
country's hazardous, waste
problems.”

The division of TNO that will
not work with CHMR - the Divi-
sion of Technology for Society —
specializes in the fields of en-
vironment, chemistry, industrial
safety, biotechnology, chemical
engineering, "coal technology and
materials research.

This group will introduce more
effective methods of solving the

problem such as in—situ soil clean- I

ing, groundwater purification,

Phone directory for
students due soon

By Jason Hillman
For The Pitt News

Students will no longer have to
worry about losing that scrap of
paper with that precious phone
number of a new acquaintance .
scrawled on it. The first student
phone directory in recent history
will soon be available to Pitt
students.

Phil Moyer, president of the
Student Government Board, said
the reason there has not been a
directory for so long is because
”  no board had come upon the
idea. -We stumbled ‘upon it in
connection with Bob Firth [Coor-
dinator of new student programs]
a_nd a couple of other people cry--
ing out ’Why isn't there a student
phone directory?’ We decided it
would be a great idea.’,’

The directory will be a listing
of all student phone numbers, on b
and off campus. Off—campus stu-
dents had to give their written
consent to have their numbers

listed, while students living on
campus had implied consent.

The huge task of collecting the
thousands of phone numbersand
organizing the directory fell upon
the shoulders of‘Vince Altomare,
member of the Student Govern-
ment Board.

He began working on this
project in early March and said
he hopes to have the the directo-
ry finished and printed as soonas
possible. ”l’ve been given a ten-
tative date of late October. This

contract date is far beyond our _
- expectations, [in that] it's later

than we would liketo have it
printed,” he said. _

The best part of the directory is
the cost. ”lt’ll be free of charge,”
Altomare said. ”And as it turns
out, it shouldn't cost the Student
Government Board a thing.”

Will there be future directories?
”-I think the" hardest step of hav-
ing one in future years is getting
the first year going,” Altomare
said. ’’I guess it's just my hope
that it does get carried on.”

Pope .

Continued from page 1

Finney attributed the smaller-
than—expected turnout to concern
by some over the heat, as temper-
atures climbed into the high 805,
and the fact that local television
was offering arriva|—to-departure
coverage.

”There may have been very

devout peoplelwho caught every I

moment on TV,” said the Rev.
Roger Morin,'who was in charge
of preparations for the New
Orleans archdiocese.
Authorities have also speculat-
ed that some people may have
been scared away by the extraor-
dinary security precautions.

Events celebrate constitution

American flag made of 30,000 . V

_By Lee Linder

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA —- Delegates '

from 12 of the 13 states spent a
steamy, sticky summer in hot de-
bate and free-wheeling com-
promise that ended Sept. 17,
1787, when they finally signed
the basic Constitution.

This week the nation formally
observes that historic event in the

_ city and the building where it all

happened.

Some activities will be con-
ducted in solemnlsilence. At 9
a.m. Wednesday an honor guafd
will be posted at the tomb of the
unknown soldier in tribute to
those who lost their lives in the
Revolutionary War. This Sunday,
the articles of association for the
nation's first black church congre-
gation went on display.

”The Great American Experi-
ment” in such things-as religious
freedom for all will be celebrat-
ed Tuesday night in a candlelight
procession. The Rev. Leon Sul-
livan, creator of the Sullivan Prin-
ciples for trade with segregated
South Africa, will be the keynote

speaker in a rally at the proces- .

sion’s end.

- Other activities signify a begin-
ning, such as Wednesday's dedi-
cation of the site for a Fountain
of Freedom monument tolbe built
using one block of native stone
from each state. \

For participants such as Jack
Kochiss, it will be the end.

tour. The exhibitfs centerpiece is
”Maggie,” Kochissfs name for the
772-year-old Magna Carta, the
English forerunner of the Consti-
tution.

The Constitution's bicentenni— ,

al celebration culminates in spec-
tacular pageantry and
speechmaking Thursday, the an-
niversary of the day the states, mi-
nus Rhode Island, approved it.

Philadelphia and across the coun-
try at 4 p.m. —— the exact hour the

38 delegates signed the historic‘

document. The day will end with
a two-hour televised show from
the Civic Center and_ fireworks.

For Philadelphia, where liberty‘
was proclaimed in 1776, the oc-
casion is just another historic
chapter in a city that was the first
U.S. capital, site of the first U.S.
bank, the first mint, the first post
office, and even the first zoo.

” ‘We the People’ 200’ has

been a real butt_on—popper for

Philadelphia and the country,”
said Willar Rouse lll, chairman of
the city's celebration committee.

The city's We The People or-
ganization has been working
since mid-1985 on the bicenten-
nial launched last May 25 at In-
dependence Hall, where an

 

’ ;

balloons floated skyward as
hundreds of thousands cheered.

Tom Muldoon, president of the-

city’s Convention and Visitors

Bureau, said the stream of events - iv 

and exhibits ”has been like a fire-
cracker with a very long fuse. It
took a while to ignite, but once
it did, what a bang from
Philadelphia.”

At one point, the city's celebra- 1
tion was on the verge of fizzling. ’ 
Mayor W. Wilson Goode had to ‘_  

replace as We the People chair-

manghis former aide, Diane Semi- S

ngson, with Rouse, who created

controversy by breaking a long— 0 , 

standing tradition that governed
building heights in Philadelphia.

Rouse promptly brought order A

and a payoff. _

The city's summer—long birth-
day party already has attracted
nearly five million visitors to in-
dependence Hall and other -sites

in Independence National .Histor- j

ical Park where Alexander Hamil-
ton, Benjamin Franklin, James
Madison, George Washington
and the other delegates struggled

over every word and phrase in T

Thrust of question

thwarted

Q: I have read in Masters and
/ohnson’s work that many men
are quite sensitive (in the male or-
gan) to pressure or containment
immediately after ejaculation,
and that considerable distress is
experienced when pelvic thrust-
ing by the female is continued.
Unfortunately, I am one ofthose

men. Since that book was written-

in 7966, I wonder ifmore is now
known about this, and if anything
can be done about it.

A: When my question is about
physical pain I have to refer you
to a urologist. I am a doctor of
education, not a medical doctor.

 g
DR. RUTH

WESTHEIMER
m

Q: I enclose a clipping about
the use of condoms to prevent
the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases. In particular, this article
points to the fact that the Food
and Drug Administration permits
the makers of latex (rubber) con-
doms to advertise that their
product can help prevent the
spread of AIDS. This is because
latex condoms are completely
non-porous, whereas those made
from sheep's intestinal mem-
brane have small pores that may
permit the passage of the AIDS
virus. I think you should publi-
cize this fact in your column. It
could save a life.

A: I agree.

Q: My girlfriend and I are both
27, and we have been sexually
active for two and a half years.

to M.D.

For the last six months, however,
we have only engaged in oral sex
and‘ that only occasionally. She
says that intercourse causes her
pain. We have a lot of foreplay,
and she sometimes dries up be-
fore intercourse begins. Her gy-
necologist says she has no
physical problem. Does this
mean she is losing interest in me?

A: It may mean that you engage
in foreplay too long. Many read-
ers may be surprised to learn that
foreplay can be too long, but it
can and so can intercourse. There
is also the possibility that she is
using a fib about discomfort to
avoid intercourse because she is
no longer willing to risk pregana—
cy with you unless she sees that
you want to make-more of a com-
mitment to her than you have
given so far.

Those are two things that come
to mind, but perhaps you two

-should visit a sex therapist

together because there may be

something here that has to be un— '

earthed in an interview.

Q: My daughter got pregnant
by a boy in her class and the first
I knew about it the mother of her
friend came and told me. She
said my daughter was afraid to
tell me. I feel completely des-
troyed as a parent. I have always
tried to be open and supportive
and understanding with her —
why didn't she come to me first?

A: It wasn't because you wer-
en’t a good mother, so forget that
idea. Probably she was not so
much afraid of you as ashamed
— too much ashamed to get the
words out telling you about it.

THE PITT NEWS

Pitt ranked #1; Goodson out untilJanuary 

The Pitt News ,.

The Pitt Panther basketball
team has been selected as the
No. 1 team in the country by
Basketball Digest.

It is the highest pre—season
ranking Pitt has ever attained ac-
cording to Kimball Smith, a Pitt
spokesman.

The magazine, which bases its
coverage on professional basket-

ball, annually. comes outwith a

college preview issue.

Basketball Digest selected Pitt
to finish first in the Big East Con-
ference followed by Syracuse and
Georgetown.

The magazine ranked Syracuse
fifth in the nation and George-
town 11th. 4

Pitt's 6-foot—1O senior center -

Charles Smith and 6—foot-6 junior
forward Jerome Lane were select-

ed second team All-Americans by
the magazine.

Last year the Panthers, who
were 25-8 and co-champions in
the‘ Big East regular season,
ranked 12th in the final Associat-
ed Press poll.

Threé starters — Smith, Lane
and senior guard/forward De-
metreus Gore -— return along
with sophomore lettermen Rod
Brookin and Pat Cavanaugh; and
a stellar freshman class which has
been rated as one of the best in
the country.

Kimball‘Smith said that he's
sure one other college basketball
magazine, which has yet to hit
the newsstands, is going to select
Pitt as its preseason choice as the

-No. 1 team in the country.

‘The only possible damper on
Pitt's prospects is last week's rul-
ing that Mike_Goodson, a junior

Mike Goodson

point guard who started in all 33
games last season,‘ is ineligible to
play basketball until Jan. 5 be-
cause of academic problems.

 

Monday, September 14, 1987

Goodson, who failed to obtain
grades in two assigned classes,
will miss eight games.

Goodson will be able to return
to the team provided he makes
up those classes during the fall
semester, according to John Bol-
vin, Pitt's faculty representative to
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.

|fGoodson fails to complete
the classes, he will be declared
academically ineligible for the
entire season.

Goodson will miss non—league
games against Robert Morris, St.
Francis (Pa.), Chicago State, West
Virginia, Akron, Jacksonville and
Florida and the two games in the
Citrus Bowl Tournament in
Orlando, Fla., Dec. 28-29.

Pitt opens the Big East Confer-
ence season at Georgetown Jan.
6, one day after the winter

semester begins. V

Evans said that Goodson’s loss
will give the young players a
chance to help out early, ‘but
Goodson’s presence would help
when Pitt gets into Big East Con-
ference play.

Goodson averaged 8 points

and 4.8 assists per game last

season.

Although Goodson’s absence

may only be a temporary one, he
is the third player Pitt has lost in
the past two weeks.

Evans announced Sept. 1 that
senior. forward Marlon Ferguson
had been declared academically
ineligible and sophomore for-
ward Chris Gatling had trans-
ferred to Old Dominion. 2

Panthers win in shutout
over N.C. State, 34-0

By Christopher’ Sepesy

Sports Editor

If a rose by any other name
would smell as sweet, then
Saturday's shutout 34-0 win by
the Pitt Panthers over the N.C.
State Wolfpack should do just
the same, right?

Pitt head coach Mike Gott-

v fried doesn't think so.

”We played a tough, hard-
fought game,” said Gottfried,
”but there were still a lot of
mistakes we madeout there
that we still need to work on.
Some of the things we did
were done with a lot of reck-
less abandon.”

In any case, this didn't seem

to bother any of the Pitt fans -

included in the 43,165 who
attended the game. .
Nor did it seem to bothe
most of the players.
’’I think we had a great
game out there today," said
- Panther linebacker Ezekial
Gadson, who,’ after two
games, hammered in yet
another great_performance to
insure his position as one of
the true stars of the team this
season. ”We went out to in-
sure ourselves another win,
and that's exactly what we
did.”

Gadson, who had seven
tackles (six unassisted) and
three sacks for 33 yards, had
his most impressive play in the
first 1 1 seconds of the game.
As N.C. State's sophomore

quarterback Shane Mont-
gomery threw a pass intended
for fullback Bobby Crumpler,
Gadson picked it off and ran
for a 6-yard return. N inety—one
seconds later, Craig I ”lron-
head” Heyward was leaping
into the endzone and Jeff Van
Home was high-kicking for a
7-0 Pitt lead.

’’I think when I made that in-
terception so early in the
game, it set the whole pace of
the rest of the game,” said
Gadson. ”It almost seems that
we had them beat within the
first five minutes of the game.
Our confidence was raised
while theirs probably just went
unden”

There is probably some truth
to this statement, especially
through the statements of
Wolfpack coach Dick
Shendan.

’’I’m really a little shocked.
[Pitt] is a lot better of a team
than they were a year ago, and
I. really didn't expect them to
be,” said Sheridan. ’’I’m real-
ly disappointed in the score,

P has done a lot to put a damp-

' the rest of the game.

and rm also really disappoint-
ed the game wasn’t tighter.
”Next week we go to Wake
Forest,” he continued. ”l just
hope that these two big losses
haven't hurt our confidences
that much. I know this game A

er on them, but hopefully
we'll be ableto bounce back '
and win some of our remain-
ing games.” _

Pitt's second touchdown at
10:53 in the first quarter exem-
plified the shock experienced
by N.C. State that Sheridan ‘
spoke of ‘above, as Heyward
virtually walked straight up the
middle five yards to the goal.
This touchdown gave Pitt a ~
14-0 lead until the 8:55 mark‘
when a 24-yard Sal Genilla
pass was thrown to Hosea
Heard for a third Pitt touch-
down. The Panthers’ fourth
came with only 50 seconds
‘left in the first half when Reg-
gie Williams caught a 19-yard
Genilla pass, upping Pitt's lead
to 27-zip. .

The true precedent was set. /

Steelers victorious over high ranked 49ers  

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Remember the 1981 San Fran-
cisco 49ers, that team which
pulled a shocking professional
football no—no by starting three
rookies, Eric Wright, Carlton Wil-
liamson and Ronnie Lott in the
defensive backfield? The whole
football world ended up choking
on its words and gawking in dis-
belief as the 49ers rocketed to
their first Super Bowl win ever
and the ’Niner defensive backs=to

instant NFL stardom.

Well, the Pittsburgh Steelers al-
ready had four championship
rings on their fingers by the time
that was happening, so in 1987,
you could say the whole thing
has been kind of a role reversal,
a deja vu 180.

The 49ers have been winning
the Super Bowls, so now it's the
Steelers chance to turn loose the

‘flashy, kid-gloves-are-off rookie

defensive back who makes the
big waves.

Deltone Hall —' remember. the

name.

In Pittsburgh's stunning 30-17
win over the 49ers at Three
Rivers Stadium yesterday, it took
the former Clemson cornerback
exactly seven defensive plays to

win the hearts of Steeler fans. An .

off-tackle run by the 49er fullback
Roger Craig was countered with
a jarring shot from Steeler line-
backer Mike Merriweather. The
ball popped loose, took a perfect
superball bounce, then was
promptly. scooped up and polite-

ly escorted 50_yards into-the;_erid- _

 

zone by the timely Hall.

”The ball fell right in front of
me and all I saw was endzone,”
said the latest Steeler hero, as it
was a 7-0 lead for never-looking-

back Pittsburgh.

’’I really think that touchdown
shocked them,” said Hall/’vThat
play gave me a quick, extra shot
of confidence.”

But Hall wasn't the only 49er-
buster playing for the Steelers, not
by a long shot. The Pittsburgh

‘ defense as a whole was simply
outst_anding,_ limiting’. the.

 

reknowned 49er ground game to
a paltry 47 yards. ’’It was embar-
rassing,” said S.F. head coach Bill
Walsh.

Although 49er quarterback Joe

Montana wasable to move his  ‘I 2
club fairly well between the.

30-yard line, he finished with a

respectable 309-yds. passing, the ’ T

endzone was pretty much off-

limits for the last season's top-_ 

ranked NFC offense. San Francis-.
co’s final touchdown — a 3-yd;
toss to Rice — came with they

0 Nothing like a little innova-
tion to spruce up a 34-0 home-

opening washout. With Panthers _

head coach Mike Gottfried dip-
ping into his intriguing collection

of backyard football plays, Pitt

somewhat resembled the Seattle
Seahawks of the late '70s — a
team that offensively wasn't
afraid to have a little bit of fun
and won a few games to boot.
The first play of Pitt's second
possession was a nifty Sal
Genilla-to-Craig Heyward-to-
Heniy Tuten end-around which
resulted in a textbook 45-yard
gain by the speedy wide receiver.
Later, Gottfried also called a sim-
plified version of the flea-flicker,
which ended in an incompletion

to Reggie Williams but looked
good regardless.

But the most exciting loop-de-
loop came on a carefully
designed, high-tech,_ fakely
botched field goal midway
through the third quarter; Holder
Billy Osborn pretended to miss
the snap, and Panther placekick—
er Jeff Van Hornescooped up the
fumble. A quick shuffle pass back
to Osborne, and he was gone -
a clean sweep through an aban-
doned left side of the field into
the endzone. Shades of Nebras-
ka's famous ”Fumblerooski” in
the 1984 Orange Bowl.

Claims Gottfried, ’’I didn't
know anything about it. I didn't
even see it. I was talking to an
offensive lineman.”

situations, ”Dean gets a lot of
momentum starting out back
there. He's a pretty good athlete

Gottfried.

was constantly in the faces of
State's quarterbacks, has sudden-
ly become Pitt's best-known sack
man with a gaudy seven in two
games. For his efforts against
BYU, he was named Sports Illus-
trated’s Defensive Player of the
Week.

0 Quarterback Larry Wanke
made his first appearance for the
Blue a_nd Gold, entering the game
at the 6:00 mark of the third
quarter. The redshirt freshman

of six passes for 42 yards, includ-
ing an 18 yardjstrike to wideout
Michael Stewart. ”Once we start-
ed blowing them out,” said
Wanke, ’’I knew I was going to

second straight 100-yard-plus
game, making him the first Pitt
player to do so in two years. Hey-
ward gained 1 15 yards on 23 car-
ries, two of which went for
touchdowns.

0 Freshman sensation Marc
Spindler is making his presence
felt as a Pitt defensive lineman.
”Marc has been just tremendous
this -season,” said DL Tony
Siragusa. ”That play he made on
fourth down [a crucial sack of
N.C. State QB Shane Mont-
gomery in the. second quarter]
really gave us a lift. He's , a
player.”

Spindler contributed four tack-
les and a sack and wore lineman

making, but we basically knew
we had them beat even then,”
said Heyward, who had a net

— gain of 115 yards with two touch-

downs. ”They really didn't give
us hardly any problems at all. Go-
ing back out from halftime, we
knew we had the game won.”

Pitt's fifth touchdown was both
its most impressive and its most
unusual. At 7:39 in the third
quarter, Van Horne attempted a
field goal after an unremarkable

third down rush. The snap was
fumbled, then recovered by Van
Horne who proceeded to lateral
the ball to Billy Osborn. Osborn
did a quick roll to the left and ran
the ball 15 yards into the end-
zone. Van Horne’s next kick was
good, making the score 34-0 —
where it would remain until the
end.

’’I think we looked the best we
have in a long time, even though
they were a pretty unprepared
team,” said Genilla, who com-
pleted 15 for 26 passes with two

interceptions and a game total of
239 yards. ”What we have to do
now is remember that all of our
games this season aren't going to
be as easy, and that we can't let
these two victories go to our
head.

”lt’s good to have confidence '

in ourselves,” he continued. ”We
just can't run away with it. If
everybody continues what we're
doing now and concentrates on
what we still have to do, we
shouldn't have any problems
whatsoever.”

At least Gottfried agreed with
this.

”The confidence of the team is
high right now,” he said, ”but
that sometimes can make you
think you're _better than you are.
While trying to make up for some
bad mistakes we've been making,

we've got to keep up with the at-
titude we've got right now. Both
the offense and the defense are
complementing each other right
now and making things easier for
each other. If we can continue
this, then we're really going

Steelers leading 30-10 and bare-
ly a minute left in the game.

”Our passing attack was really
out of sync. That wasn't the kind
of performance we expected
from our players, but the Steelers
did have a lot to do with it,” said
Walsh. ”Give them credit. They
played a beautiful game.” I

Leading 7-3 in the second
quarter, Pittsburgh mixed Ernest
Jackson runs with Malone pass-
es — including a crucial 27—yd.
strike on third-and—five to rookie
running Merril Hoge —— and
pieced together a solid 11—play,
66-yard drive that ended in a
Mark Malone rollout, touchdown
pass to tight end Preston Gothard.
”The execution on that play was
perfect,” beamed the Steeler
quarterback. ’’Actually, that

whole drive was well executed.”

A 50-yard Gary Anderson field
goal with :10 to play in the half
sent Pittsburgh into the locker
room 17-3.

The Steelers upped their lead to
20-3 midway through the third
quarter on another Anderson
boot, this one set up by Hall's
(see, there's that name again)
volleyballed interception of a
tipped Montana aerial. ”A lot of
things that went against us today
were just out of our control. It
was that kind of a day,” a deject-
ed Montana admitted.

Despite the grand amount of
points chalked up by the Steelers,
Malone’s contribution was any-
thing but a halI—of—fame perfor-
mance and nothing short of a
hall-of-shame performance. He
completed only 9 of his 33 at-

 

 
  
   

 

tempts for an embarassing 89
yards. ’’I’m not making excuses,
but we have had some guys hurt
on the offensive line, and the new
unit has to get accustomed‘ to
playing together.”

Granted, and it's also a well-
known fact that the 49er pass

defense is the NFL’s iron curtain, _

but Malone’s protection was

more than adequate and his.

receivers were open on quite a
few occasions. Pittsburgh has to
improve that part of its offensive
scheme, maybe by adding more
screen plays and downfield pass-
es to the running backs. The 183
rushing yards the team compiled

on Sunday just isn't going to be" i

there every week.
But for the Steeler defense,

when the need for a big play ’

arises, hopefully Delton Hall will
be.

Nobody thought they could
do it, but the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers, one of the lowest ranked

teams in their division, beat

the San Francisco 49ers Sun-
day, 30-17. - .

Here, Delton Hall runs for
a touchdown.

Falcons haven't

got a snowball’s
chance in NFC

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer \

THE NFC WEST

Ever hear of Ernie Zampese?
He's the new offensive coordina-
tor for the Los Angeles Rams.
Yeah, so what, right? Well, Zam-
pese is a direct descendant of that
legendary offensive whirlwind
known as ”Air Coryell,” the old
San Diego Charger Power.
Remember what kind of numbers
that collection of superstars used
to rack up? Big, big numbers. And
L.A. too has the superstars in the
fireballing quarterback Jim
Everett, a bunch of fleet-street
wideouts including Henry Ellard
and Ron Brown, not to mention
that incredible human odometer,
Eric Dickerson, to complement
the system. Air Zampese —— ahh,
the Rams are really gonna be
something this season. 12-4.

After watching the San Francis-
co 49ers get pulverized by the
Giants, 49-3, in the playoffs last

»winter, then yesterday hearing

Jimmy ”The Creek” prophesize
a trip to the Super Bowlfor the
team, I thought to myself ”No
way -— "The Greek” has flipped

his wig. NO team gets whipped .
» by 46 points in the. playoffs one

year then simply wakes up and
wins the championship the
next.” My opinion hasn't
changed. Sure, Joe Montana is
back and ready to roar. Sure the
’Niners had a solid draft, filling
some quite obvious holes. But
the old guys are getting too old,
and the young bucks are just too
young to take charge. And after

watching Pittsburgh lay waste to
the 49ers, it's all the more obvi-
ous that this is a team in transi-
tion. 10-6.

You read it here first — the
New Orleans Saints will have
their first_winning season ever" in
1987. Head coach Jim Mora and
running back Reuben Mayes are
the miracle workers in the Loo-
siana Bayou, quietly carving a
reasonable — not overpowering,
but reasonable — contender out
of the one-time ’Aints. The crucial
key to the New Orleans season

is QB Bobby Hebert, the former-

USFL standout. As long as he re-
mains healthy, which he certain-
ly wasn't last year, the Saints will
have a rallying point and finish a
respectable  halleluia  9-7.
Oh,‘ the Atlanta Falcons -
another woe-is—me N FL franchise.

‘Last season, the Falcons caught

the nation's eye .by soaring to an
impressive 5-1 mark, then life-
lessly fell out of the sky and
finished a baffling 7-8‘-1. What
happened? The primary finger-
pointing area is the injury
suffered by starting quarterback
David Archer, who missed the
last five games of the season.
”Maybe our momentum and
rhythm were affected by Dave's

.injury,” head coach Marion

Campbell remarked, ”but we're
looking at the team's bottom line
(wins).” Even with Archer, the
offense is unpredictable and
shaky; also, the retirement of the
once-feared William Andrews
didn't help matters much. Only
the defense will keep the Falcons
off the ground, if only a few feet.
5-1 1 .

  

THE PITT NEWS, Monday,-September 14, 1987

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer‘

The Pitt women's volleyball
team won the Temple Invita-
tional this past weekend, beat-
ing out top—ranked teams such
as Bowling Green, Providence
and Purdue.

According to head coach

. Shelton Collier, the Lady Pan-
thers accomplished several
goals at the invitational. '

First, the Lady Panthers
soundly defeated last year's
Big East runner up, Providence
College, which is always a
dominant team in the Big East.

Pitt won the best of five
games in three straight win-
nings 15-2, 15-3 and 15-7.

Next, the Lady Panthers beat

I Bowling Green, who upset na-
tionally ranked Purdue last
week. Th-is proved to be a
tough matchfor the Lady Pan-
thers to pull out.

”We were down 8-3 in the
fifth game,” said Collier. ”We

came back scoring 12 straight

points and won. It was an im-
portant win for us since we
were able to come back like
that."

Junior Denise Frawley said,
”The way we held off Bowling
Green is really rare in volley-
ball and showed some good
fighting and hustling on our
parts.”

In the semi-finals, Pitt met- ‘

Temple and beat them in three
straight sets.

During this match, Pitt's se-
cond string was playing Tem-
ple’s first string.

”This was important for two
reasons,” said Collier. ”First it
proved that we have good
-depth, and second it let our
starters rest up for the finals. It

was a real boost for the team.” _

Pitt again played Bowling
Green in the championship
matchwhich Collier feels was
their best match of the series.

”We felt confident since we
beat them earlier,” said Colli-
er. ”We_played our best match

Spikers win at Temple

Pitt's record is now 6-0. To
win the championship Pitt
defeated five teams in six

matches: George Mason 3-0, '

James Madison 3-1, Provi-
dence 3-0, Bowling Green
3-2, Temple 3-0 and Bowling
Green 3-1.

Pitt had two players named
to the all tournament team.
Senior outside hitter, Lisa
Stewart, had a total of 62 kills,
and junior »-Frawley finished
with 53 kills.

Collier feels that winning
the TemplelTournament will
give his team added ‘confi-

CHICAGO (AP) -— The rarity of
an NFL season opener between
the last two Super Bowl champi-
ons will add to the extravaganza
Monday night when the New

York Giants meet the Chicago -

Bears.

A crowd of more than 66,000
will jam Soldier Field, while the
game is expected to attract the
largest television audience in
Monday night football history.

’’I doubt if the game will be as
good as the hype,” Bears Coach

. Mike Ditka said.

It will mark only the second
time that successive Super Bowl
champions have met in the fol-
lowing season-opening game.

Two years ago, the Bears
defeated the Giants 21-0 in the
playoffs and went on to capture
the Super Bowl with a 46-10
drubbing of the New England
Patriots.. . .

The Giants extended their win-
ning streak to 12 games last sea-
son with a 39-20 triumph over

Bowl.

The only other time successive
Super Bowl champions have met
in a season-opener was in 1982
when the Los _Angeles Raiders
defeated the defending champi-
on San Francisco 49ers 23-17.

The game will feature two of
the toughest defenses in the
league. The Bears will be aiming
for an unprecedented fourth
straight NFL defensive title. They
set an NFL record by allowing
only 187 points for a 16-game
season last year.

The Bears also are trying to be-
come the first team to lead the
league in rushing five straight
years — and that worries Giants
Coach Bill Parcells.

The Bears’ defense will have to
contain a Giants’ offense led by »
quarterback Phil Simms, running
back Joe Morris and tight end _
Mark Bavaro. Simms was voted
the Super Bowl’s Most Valuable
Player after completing 22 of 25
passes for268 yards and three

touchdowns against the Broncos.’ ,
