“ Students can buy computers through Pitt

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

The Personal Computer Sup-
port and Service Center, run by
Computer Information Systems, is
now providing Pitt students with
the option to buy computers at a
discount.‘

”What I think is most interest-
ing to students,” said Jinx Wal-
ton, assistant director of
information services for CIS, ”is
the discounts that were negotiat-
ed with Apple and IBM [by the
university] which includes the
ability for faculty, staff, and stu-
dents to buy personal computers
at the university discount for per-
sonal use. But until now, there
was no real way to get the com-
puters.”

According to Walton, there are
a variety of Apple and IBM per-
sonal computers on display for
potential student buyers.

”You can come in here, look
around, look the computers over
and experiment with the ones
you like, talk with a consultant,
and then you can decide what
you want,” said Walton.”We
aren't going to try to give the
most expensive, but the one you
can afford and [that].works best
for you. .

Everyone [at the Center] is a
university employee,” Walton
added. ”We don't make a profit
from this. What we're doing is
passing along the discounts.”

The discounts the Center pro-
vides include an IBM personal
computer system (model number

ln—vitro quints born

» ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) —- A woman gave birth to quin-
tuplets conceived through in-vitro fertilization, apparently the
nation's first set of test-tube quintuplets, and all were doing well,
a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday.

”They’re beautiful,” Michele L’Esperance, 34, said at a news
conference Tuesday. Her husband Raymond said he was
relieved the delivery was over.

The babies, four girls and a boy, were born Monday by
Caesarean section between 10:34 p.m. and 10:38 p.m., said
Deb Mero, a spokeswoman for William Beaumont Hospital.

A London woman gave birth to five test-tube babies in March

”They are doing well,” Mero said. ”We don't have an offi-
cial condition on them, but none of them is on a respirator."
I Two of the babies, however, were having ”respiratory dis-
tress” and were receiving oxygen, she said.
No further details were available immediately. Conditions are
not assigned to newborn infants because they change hourly
and are inaccurate, said Valerie Mahaczek, another hospital

/The babies, born two months premature, have a 90 percent
95 percent chance of survival, said Dr. Daniel Batton, a ne-

8530-021) that costs $2,295 list
price and is $1,377 at the Center.
A more expensive model, 8580-
071 normally costs $8,495 and

' costs $5,097 at the Center. The

least expensive model of IBM
($1,350 list price) is only $810.

”Once you buy the equip-
ment,” said Walton, ”you can
pick it up here. We provide
orientation classes, and if the
equipment breaks,cbring it back,
and we'll fix it. And for equip-
ment that was not purchased
here, you will still be able to
bring it here and drop it off.”

CIS has offered the discount
since Dec. 15 and since then, 20
computers have been sold.

Drug testing discussed

By Rod Snyder

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — Supporters of
legislation to control workplace
drug testing told a House com-
mittee yesterday that accuracy is
a serious concern and specific
restrictions are needed.

William Reck, an official with
the Pennsylvania AFL—ClO, said
studies have shown error rates up
to 66 percent, adding that the
tests can be affected by such
common substances as cough
syrup and caffeine.

The problem has been exacer-
bated in recent years,~said Reck,
because ”it has become increas-
ingly fashionable for employers
 to use drug tests to screen all
job applicants and all employees

of our services," said Walton.
”What we're really going to do,
as far as students are concerned,
is try to provide certain services,
to be able to purchase a com-
puter and bring it in with a‘war—
ranty, somewhere on campus so
they're not going have to go
crosstown.”

‘The Center is providing the dis-
counted equipment only to Pitt
students with a valid ID. The
Apple-Macintosh equipment is
available only to full—time stu-
dents and faculty. The IBM equip-
ment, however, is available to
part-time students as well as
full-time.

The Center, which is located in
room 204 in the Bellefield An-
nex, is open from’ 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Friday.

or to force applicants and em-
ployees to submit to such tests on
a random basis.”

Reck was one of many witness-
es to testify before the House
Labor Relations Committee,
which is considering legislation
to regulate drug testing.

The bill, sponsored by commit-
tee chairman Mark Cohen, D-
Philadelphia, would ban random
and systematic drug testing and
require employers that impose
the tests to establish a program to
help workers found abusing
drugs. '

It would also prohibit employ-
ers from firing workers on the ba-
sis of an initial drug test and
mandate state health officials to
establish standards for tests.

organize  

blood

drive  

By Merritt Neale Jr.
Staff Writer

The second of three blood
drives scheduled for the 1988
Greek Week competition started
yesterday in the William Pitt
Union.

”This is a way to bring all of the
fraternities together in competi-
tion before the actual Greek
Week,” said Lee Brody, overall
chairman of Greek Week.

Brody said that this year's
blood donation goal is 1,800
pints. All three blood drives are
co-sponsored by the |nterfraterni-
ty Council and the Central Blood
Bank.

”The response has been great,
the kids have been great, and the
fraternities have shown great sup-
port," said Rosemary Shankle,
head nurse for the Central Blood
Bank.

The 1988 blood drive chairper-
sons are Jen Hugos and Scott
Lawry.

8 Greek Week activities will be-
gin on March 17. Events sched-
uled include a 24-hour dance

marathon, a Greek Chariot Race,

the Greek Olympics and the
Greek Gourge, — a who-can—eat—
the-most sandwiches —- contest.

”This year's fund—raising goal is
$75,000 compared with last
year's $72,000 raised,” said
Brody.

According to Brody, the Greek
Week activities over the past five
years have totaled more than a
quarter of a million dollars.

This year's Greek Week chari-
ty is the Western Pennsylvania
School for Blind Children.

”We chase them [the blind
school] due to the school's dedi-
cation to the Oakland area and
their need for funding the new $9
million facility which will ac-
comodate the multi-handicapped
students.”

Both Brady and Shankle were
pleased with yesterday's turnout
of donors.

”The first time I did [donated
blood], it was for [Greek Week]
points, now I think that it is some-
thing everbody should do,” said
Reid Muchler, a brother at Sigma
Alpha Mu.

Pitt student Mary Mazur said
her boyfriend urged her to
donate.

The blood drive will be held
until 5:45 p.m. this week in the
William Pitt Union lower level
and is open to the public.

WEST ELIZABETH, Pa. - The
spill of one million gallons of
diesel fuel into the Monongahe-
la River has fishermen worried as
experts assess how bad the fish
kill is.

”The first thing I thought was
the river would be ruined again.
It's a shame. It was really getting
to be a prime fishery. Now, we'll
just have to wait to see,” said
Pete Leventopoulos, who runs a
bait and tackle shop near the site
of the spill.

The magnitude of the kill won't
be known until biologists can
study spring spawning patterns.
Hundreds of fish have been poi-
soned as the foul-smelling oil
slick oozed downriver, but ex-
perts say it would have been
worse if the fuel spilled in sum-
mer when fish are more active.

”We know there’s a partial kill
going on. We don't think it will
be a major kill. My best guess is
that hundreds are dead, instead
of thousands and tens of thou-
sands,” said Blake Weirich, a bi-
ologist with the Pennsylvania Fish
Commission.

”On a scale of one to 10, this

  

    

.};$$3$$$'S‘$‘$$$S$*$,$$'$'$$$$$'$$$SSSSS-$$$$.

was probably a five or six in
terms of a kill. If it had happened
in the summer, it would have
been a 10. If it had to happen,
this is the best time of year for it
to happen,” Weirich said.

The sport species that fisher-
men love — walleye, bass,
muskellunge, northern pike and
sauger — require less oxygen and
are much less active in the
winter, biologists said.

They also stay at the bottom of
the river, which means they
would have less contact with oil
floating on the surface.

Dead fish found along water in-
takes of industrial plants include
less desirable species such as
carp, channel catfish, sheepshead
and gizzard shad. However, a
41-inch, 20-pound northern pike
was found dead inlWheeling,
W.Va., along the Ohio River.

es that claimed 231 lives, the fed-

The National Transportation
Safety Board said that was the

they had 42 accidents.

Meanwhile, small private air-

The NTSB, in its summary of
1987 air accidents, said 58 peo-

died in four crashes involving
larger jet aircraft.

The 231 deaths comprised the

351 in 1979.

Experts worried spill may cause big fish kill--

over the previous year, with 0.43
accidents per 100,000 departures
last year compared to 0.31 in
1986. Those figures did not in-
clude the crash of a Pacific South-
west Airlines jet on Dec. 7
because that accident is believed
to have been an act of sabotage.

Wilkinsburg to lay off-

WILKINSBURG, Pa. —- All but
the chief of Wilkinsburg’s
32—member police force will be
laid off Friday in a move to en-
sure unemployment compensa-
tion for officers and to prod banks
into loaning money to this finan-
cially strapped Pittsburgh suburb.

”Now that it has come to this
— the borough with no police
protection —- the banks will real-
ize the dire situation we're in- and
will take a close look at this
borough,” said Councilam Mark
Weitzman.

”The blessing in disguise may
be that, in the next three days, the
banks will negotiate, and get as
serious with us as we've been
serious with them, and give us
the loans we need,” Weitzman

Boy leaves school
for fear of AIDS

KUNKLETOWN, Pa. (AP) —-
Wayne Hughart doesn't think the
public schools are ready for
AIDS, and he has decided he

Hughart, of Eldred Township,

Craig Stenger, an AIDS virus
carrier. \

”This should never have hap-
pened,” said Hughart. ”I don't
feel the school district Pleasant
Valley is really equipped to take
care of an AIDS case.”

Craig Stenger has tested posi-
tive for the AIDS virus but has no
signs of the disease.

Hughart said he believes the
school district isn't doing enough
to make sure students don't come
in contact with Stenger. But he
doesn't think his son will contract
AIDS from the incident.

Last week's incident is the sec-
ond involving Stenger and
another student since Stenger was
ordered back to school last May.

Madoff files lawsuit

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

At Monday's City Council
meeting, Councilwoman
Michelle Madoff tried and failed
to introduce legislation in City
Council calling for the removal of
board members Eugene P.Ueep)
DePasquale and Jim O’Mally
from the board of the Allegheny
County Sewer Authority for al-
leged misappropriations of funds.

Madoff announced that she
and six other rate payers of the
Allegheny County Sanitation

have filed a rate—payer lawsuit

against ALCOSAN for misap-
propriation of funds

Louis Tallota, a Squirrel Hill in-
terior designer, is listed in
Madoff’s complaint against AL-
COSAN. However, according to
Tallota’s wife, her husband is
willing to support Madoff in other
endeavors but cannot support her
in this legal action. She declined
to comment as to why her hus-
band couldn’t support Madoff.

Listed in the lawsuit are
Michelle Madoff, Dr. Lee Wien~
thal, Peter Neft, the Stearling Box
Company, Jack and Barbara
Shore and Franklin West.

Closing the gates
before the flood

The University of Pittsburgh, as a proudly progressive insti-
tution, subscribes to the many ideologies that serve as a foun-
dation for equality for every human being under its realm. It
is in this spirit that ACTION, the Action Committee to Include
Sexual Orientation in the Non-discrimination Policy, plans to
request that the university amend the non-discrimination policy.

The efforts of such grassroots committees are instrumental
to necessary reinforcement of such proclamations, and, by their
nature, force administrators to reassess the purpose and appli-
cation of such policies.

While some may argue that if the lesbian and gay sector of
the population at Pitt and elsewhere succeeds in having such
inclusions to policies, every cross—section of society will attempt
to make such changes.

In this instance, however, the change is indeed merited and
is for the better interest of a substantial part of the population
that too often has been discriminated -against in the past.

In addition, the fear of contracting~AIDS is great among the
general population. Now, more than ever, such a clause that
prohibits discrimination against people for their sexual orien-
tation is vital. With more and more people contracting the vi-
rus and the disease, it is inevitable that more occasions will
arise in which a person will be discriminated against because
of their orientation, because they are feared to have AIDS.

An ideal statement of non-discrimination should not even

have to demand an itemized list; however, because it.must in '

our society, it should include this clause. In the long run, more
of us than we'd like to think may look to such a clause for pro-
tection.

They lie side by side on my desk
and, I must admit, in my brain.

The first is about time, or the
lack of it, in our lives. If people
drew up a January list of wishes
instead of resolutions, suggests
the author, our first wish would
be for more time.

The second article is one I

should file under home main»

tenance. In it, an expert warns
that any decent germ—fearing
owner of an ultrasonic humidifi-
er should clean the tank every
day with a cup of bleach.

As a certified humidifier own-
er and a bona fide citizen in pur-
suit of elusive free time, I find
myself making a connection be-
tween this incongruous pair of
messages. .

Maybe the infamous time
crunch of the 19805 is not just a
product of work and family pres-
sures. Maybe we are not all just
overachievers who feel lazy un-
less we are listening to Swahili
tapes while running three miles

in an event for a worthy social
cause. Maybe part of the problem
is the demands put on us by the
burgeoning number of THINGS.
Maybe we consume things that,
in turn, consume our time.
Everything, even the so-called
time-saving device and energy ef-
ficient machine, comes these
days with an elaborate set of in-
structions for/its care and feeding.
Buying a machine has become
more and more like buying a pet.

You get the feeling that you
aren't worthy of owning a hu-
midifier unless you promise to
clean it with bleach. You don't
deserve a coffee maker unless
you faithfully give it doses of
white vinegar. You don't warrant
a VCR unless you run the head
cleaner through it routinely.

And I haven't even mentioned
the car. 

As an owner, I am often guilty
of thing-neglect. I am about as
likely to get up every morn_ing
and pour bleach in my humidifi-
er as I am to shave the pills from
my sweaters. I have enough trou-
ble remembering to floss.

The ”geowimp” and warfare

For no other reason than being
entirely bored one afternoon, I
picked up an old issue of Seven-
teen, magazine that was lying
around the news office and
flipped through it. It wasn't until
almost the end of the magazine
that I discovered an article that
came anywhere near my interests
(as I am neither seventeen nor a
girl this wasn't surprising).

The article yvas a ’.’quiz’’ that
purported to test the geography
knowledge of their readership by
stating that 67 percent of the
respondents to some- poll
couldn't locate Japan on a map
of the world and if you didn't
want to be a "geowimp” you
should be able to answer this
quiz. I scored a perfect thirty-
eight points out of thirty-eight
points.

This, however, started me
thinking. Mainly because I know
several people who know that
Japan is an island in the Far East,
but they're not exactly sure

But I am subject, nevertheless,
to the ultimate way that THINGS
devour time. By breaking.
Without doubt, the two words
that strike the deepest terror in the
heart of a person whose life is
contained in an Hour—At—A-
Glance book 'are these: ”It’s
broken."

This announcement conjures
up two horror scenes. One of
themlis the classic rendition of
waiting for the Godot Repair
Company. This is an outfit that es-

where. Worse still, there are peo-
ple who can't answer far easier
questions about the world on
non—geography topics.
Someone once claimed that
Americans learn geography by
going to war, and this seems to
be pretty much something I can
agree with. How many people
out there, I wonder, didn't know
that Nicaragua is in Central
America or that Lebanon is in the
Middle East (even though we ar-
en’t fighting in either place).

_ Americans, it seems, have been
traditionally daft of -what goes on
in the world. It would seem too
many of us are too caught up
with our own existence to bother
finding what else is going on the
world. It is this trend that happens
to get us into wars in places, it

timates its time of arrival in your
city as alternate Tuesdays be-
tween dawn and dusk. The other
is a road tour that leads you to the
remote and highly specialized
factory—service representative.
This is located handily next door
to the motel where you may
check in and wait.

In my experience, the amount
of time spent transporting broken
television sets, answering
machines and personal com-
puters surpasses the amount of
time spent transporting
preschoolers to gymnastic class-
es they will not remember when
they are in analysis. The amount
of time spent waiting for a repair-
man to come and fix a disposal
or automatic icemaker surpasses
the amount of time spent in a
meat line in Warsaw.

And I still haven't even men-
tioned the car.

My own major culprit in this
department is the vacuum clean-.
er I live with and for. This is a
machine that breaks down so
routinely that I am trying to en-
roll it in an HMO.

seems, we know nothing about.

The whole problem here is that
Americans are more worried
about the here and now than the
future. People would rather wor-
ry about subsidizing farmers in
the Mid-West than in helping an
obscure small country in some far

corner of the globe. Then, when I

that small obscure country goes
somewhere else for help (let's
say, for example, the Soviets), the
government tries to do something
at the last minute which usually
doesn't work and gets the U.S. in
a bigger mess than it bargained
for both at home and abroad.

Possible cures to the myopia of
American foreign policy would
be easy to name but hard to im-
plement. A simple remedy would
be for people to take it upon
themselves to keep up with
what's going on in the world and
elect. government officials who
also know what's going on.

victims of thing—dependency?

I know that I am not‘ the only
person who wastes time on the
things that are supposed to free
time or enhance time. We have
all become machine caretakers-in
one way or another. We buy
some thing in the flush of desire,
the rush of romance; it's only

later we realize we've made a ..

committment to it.

It insists on being cleaned. It
demands to be fed bleach or

vinegar. At the very best, it nags

you to make use of it for the
manufacture of yogurt or popcorn
or videotapes. At the very worst,

' it forces you to take it to be fixed.

It not only gives, it takes  time.

This is one of the ironies of a
thoroughly modern life. We are
time—crunched. Not just by the
number of things we have to do
but the number of things we
have. In the late 20th century,
things have become our new de-
pendents.

Now then, let's talk about the
car.

 Woman can't reach orgasm with boyfriend  

Q: My sisters assure me that
they have orgasms regularly, as
a matter ofcourse. As a matter of
course, l don’t. My boyfriend
needs sex daily, but I think now
and then would be more than
enough. I often get sore from in-
tercourse, and this is most apt to
happen during periods of stress.
I guess I have a sexual dysfunc-
tion.'The sex books I have tried
don't seem to help. Any ideas?

A: First, about getting sore, use
a lubricant such as K—YJelly. Not
such as Vaseline, which is a
trademarked brand of petroleum
jelly. Petroleum jelly,
trademarked or not, is harmful to
condoms and other rubber
products. I mention the brand
name because you may not want
to discuss the product and what
you want to do with it with a
drugstore clerk, but just go in and

have sex with him. The fact is that
women have to know how to
have orgasms and have to allow
them to happen or encourage
them to happen by their own
maneuvers. The greatest male
lover in the world can't ”give” an
orgasm to a woman who is un-
willing to have an orgasm. Or
who doesn't know, consciously
or unconsciously, how to have
one.

That may sound impossible, to \

know something unconsciously,
but it is done all the time. First,
there are things we learned long
ago and then forgot learning —-—
standing on two feet, walking, ty-
ing shoelaces — things the song
called ”doing what comes natur-
ally." There are women who
have little trouble learning to en-
joy sex fully. There are others
who have for some reason more
trouble, and this is to be expect-
ed when there is little teaching
about human activity.

Often, people sabotage their
own efforts. A person may have
some bad experience in the
water, something long forgotten.
Now, that person can't learn to
swim. Whenever he thinks of
learning to swim, he hates the
feeling and images he gets, and
he thinks, ”This lesson will be as
bad all the others, and I still won't
know how to swim.” And you,
when you think of sex, you think
of soreness instead of being close
to your lover and enjoying the
entire experience, not just the
possibility of ecstasy. So you have
to avoid that soreness when you
do have sex by using the
lubricant. ‘

And you have to learn how to
give yourself an orgasm before
you will allow yourself to have
one with your lover. If you have
difficulty doing that, buy a vibra-
tor and use it. Either a battery or
house—current vibrator is OK. The
ordinary massage—type vibrator
works better than one made to
look sexy.

So avoid sabotaging your own
sex encounters with your lover.
I am not accusing you of anything
—— this sabotaging or flinching
away from something we don't
do well is a nearly universal ex-
perience. But you stop thinking
about soreness when you know
it is avoidable, and you stop tell-
ing yourself, ’’I can't have or»-
gasms, I can't have orgasms/'\
when you know you can. "

With your lover, daily sex is
too much for you, and now and
then is certainly not enough for
him. Agree on every other day
and that sometimes you can
pleasure him to climax without
having one yourself, sometimes
even without intercourse but
through some form of foreplay.

It happens that few couples
agree on the desirable frequency
of sex, but if they love or like
each other, if they are on good
terms, they can accomodate each
other. This will help you to stop
sabotaging, too. You don't have
to have sex every day, when that
is irksome to you. And you don't
have to have the pressure to try
for an orgasm every time. If you
are more relaxed and less ”goal—
oriented” about the whole thing,
then what you want ultimately
will come more easily.

Wrestling team pins
F&M College, 48-0

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team faced
off against Franklin & Marshall
College at Fitzgerald Field House
last night. It wasn't so much of a
meet as it was a wrestling clinic
by the Panthers.

Pitt came out strong from the
opening whistle and thrashed the
Diplomats 48-0.

”This was boring,” said Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer. ’’I
hope we can do this against some
of the better teams.”

The first match was the only
one in which the Diplomats had
a lead. It was also the only match
in which Franklin & Marshall was
able to win a period. Pitt's Brian
O’Korn fell behind in the second
period, 5-4, but pinned his man
in the third. The pin gave Pitt a
6-0 lead it would never
relinquish.

Pitt’s lineup was scattered with
three freshman, all of whom per-
formed well. The tightest match
for Pitt's freshmen was Panther
Sean Moffitt’s match at 126

pounds against Greg D’Alssan-
dro. Moffitt still won 4-1.
Panther Pat Santoro (142
pounds) continued to rock his op-
ponents. He came out on fire to
take an early 8-1 lead in the first

‘period. With just over a minute

gone in the second, he nailed his
man to the floor for the pin. ”l
was ready to wrestle today [last

night]/’ said Santoro. ’’I had a lot»

of energy left over from the Mid-
land's Tournament [which San-
toro won], and just came out fast.
I was ready to go.”

An interesting aspect of the
Santoro match was that the entire
field house crowd was quiet from
the start of the match. The crowd
must have known they were
watching one of the nation’s
finest wrestlers at work.

Franklin & Marshall coach
Mark Faller had been doing his
best impression of Bobby Knight
throughout the first few matches.
And even he just sat quietly and
watched Santoro’s match.

Santoro is currently ranked
number one in the nation by the

The best and worst of Panther slam dunks

Tired of reading basketball
statistics about free-throw percen-
tage, field—goal percentage and
other trivialities? Well, then, how
about some stats on slams?

The Panthers have had their
share of innovative dunkers the
last few years. Demetreus Gore
started off his college career with

his first six points all coming on.

breakaway slams. Charles Smith,
at 6-foot-10, d0esn’t impress in
his rim—rattling ala Spud Webb,
but he's been known to throw a
few down with pizzazz.

Ex-Panther Darryl Shepherd
never mastered the trade, but
with his 42-inch vertical leap, Pitt
fans were always on the edge of
their seats.

And anyone who considers
himself an avid Pitt hoop follow-
er has to remember Jerome
Lane's monster slam over
Georgetown’s Michael Jackson
two years ago at the Civic Arena.

So this year, as the Panthers
have attained their highest rating
ever (sixth by The Associated
Press), the team still has its share
of high—flying, mystifying
slammers.

Only now, one player stands
out from the crowd — Smith.

Here's a rundown of Pitt’s best
and worst slam stats as the Pan-
thers approach the midway point
of the 1987-88 season:

Total dunks: 34 (or 2.83 dunks
per game).

Team leader: Charles Smith -
20 (or 1.6 dunks per game). .

This isn't astonishing. Remem-
ber, Smith is close to seven feet
tall. But his 20 slams still can't be
downplayed. Smith has dunked
in every game but three. And he's
had eight dunks in the last two
games. Plus, eight of his dunks
have come against two of Pitt's
better opponents (Florida and St.
John's).

Vlenna Hunter/The Pitt News

Bill Lewis prepares to face Warren McNaughton.

 

Most dunks one game, team:
Pitt with six, vs. St. John's.

Pitt took advantage of St. John's
inferior inside game as Smith was
open for slams all night. Lane,
maybe Pitt's most versatile
dunker, added a nifty left-hander
on a fast break.

Most dunks one game, player:
Smith with five, vs. St. John's.

No wonder Smith went eight-
for-eight from the floor to set a

JOHN

ENRIGHT ’

new Pitt, single-game field-goal
percentage mark. Hey, it's easy to
shoot 55 plus from the field when
you have your hands on the rim
almost every time you shoot the
ball.

Least dunks one game, team:
Pitt with zero vs. both Akron and
Georgetown.

There was no particular reason
Pitt went dunkless in these two
nailbiters. Of course, if Smith had
played better and stayed out of
foul trouble, the Pantherswould
probably be working on a
12-game slamming streak right
now.

Least dunks one player,
season: Sean Miller and Jason
Matthews.

The two freshmen have yet to
throw one down. Of course, it
may never happen. Miller, bare-
ly six feet tall, probably can't do
it, and Matthews looks like he'd
only give it a try if Pitt were up
by 40 and Evans was looking the
other way.

Most important dunk, season:
Rod Brookin’s slam over Chris
Brooks at West Virginia. .

The dunk put Pitt up by four
with over five minutes left, but

Stargell
inducted

NEW YORK (AP) - Willie
Stargell, who inspired the Pitts-
burgh Pirates to two World
Series titles with his power and
pride, on Tuesday became the
17th player to be elected to
the baseball Hall of Fame in
the first year of eligibility.

Stargell was named on 352
of 427 ballots (82.4 percent)
returned to the Baseball
Writers’ Association of Ameri-
ca. In order to be elected, a
player must be named on 75
percent of the ballots, which
this year was 321.

It was another disappointing
year, however, for pitcherjim
Bunning. After missing by 21
votes last year, Bunning fell
four votes short with 31 7 (74.2
percent) in his 12th year of
eligibility.

Stargell hit 475 homers with
1,540 runs batted in and a
.282 batting average in 21 sea-
sons with the Pittsburgh
Pirates. He was equally
regarded for his qualities as a
leader on the field and in the
clubhouse.

ticut, a more rational response
would have been ”Huskies” or
”basketball” or something like
that.

Then again, considering the
long—time sad-sack state of Con-
necticuts’s basketball team,
maybe Marisol isn't that bad an
answer after all.

UConn basketball. Haven't
heard that pair of words put
together like that since way back
in the late, late '70s. Back when
guys like Corny Thompson and
Randy LaVigne and Jeff Carr
proudly directed %the blue and
white of Connecticut to three
straight 20-win seasons. Way

back before the Big East was‘

hatched, when the ECAC (the
what?) was the divine ruler of
Eastern hoopfest. Back before the
emergence of the Syracuse Car-
rier Dome and Georgetown’s
residence in the Capital Center
and the duPont Pavilion at Vil-

lanova. .
The way it stands now, about

the amount of excitement caused
when the Huskies come to town
is nearly equal to a snow cone
truck overturning 60 miles out-

‘ ' side of Nome.

Who cares? And even if some-
one did, who'd be paying atten-
tion to hear the news?

Last season, injuries and the
concept of academics plagued
the long-beleaguered Husky pro-
gram. First-year head coach Jim
Calhoun was forced to employ
several walk-ons to fill his roster,

V and a good many of them saw

quite a bit of action. .

Needless to say, UConn, play-
ing one of the toughest schedules
in the country last year, finished
a dismal 9-19, including an even
more dismal 3-13 last-place
showing in the Big East.

But 1987-88 has seen the for-
tunes of Calhoun’s club travel
somewhat along the upswing.
The Huskies, with a less brutal
schedule on tap, have jumped
out to an impressive 8-3 record,
with their three losses coming to
tough Virginia, Villanova and Se-
ton Hall teams.

On Jan. 9, UConn upset the '

talented but inexperienced Provi-
dence Friars. A win tonight
against the Pitt Panthers would

mark the first time Connecticut

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January I3, I988

. ___________.___‘__________________________...

Continued from page 8

has won back—to-back Big East
games since it consecutively top-
pled Pitt and Syracuse midway
through the 1984-85 season.

”We know we're going to be
in for one heckuva ballgame
against Pitt,” said Calhoun.
”They’ve got so much talent, they
can attack you‘ in so many ways.

’’If we're going to have any

chance at being successful, we've
got to keep [Panther forward] Jer-
ome Lane off the boards. Then
we're got to put some sort of res-
traint on [Pitt center Charles]
Smith. And then if we can con-
trol the tempo, maybe 

It makes one want to picture
Calhoun in one of those Hewlett
Packard TV spots: As he bends
over to a panting, ivory-white

Husky, ”What if  we have six
or seven good 10-hour practices,
then web-up Charlie Smith's legs
with a high-pressure cannon fir-
ing Silly String, then finish off all
that rocket fuel ...”

The Huskies are led by junior
center Cliff Robinson. Averaging
18.8 ppg and 9.2 rpg, Robinson
is considered one of the premier
players in the East.

The forward positions are filled
by Jeff King (6.7 PPS) and Willie
McCloud (6.5 PPS).

Operating from the point guard
position is sophomore Tate Ge-
orge, who averages 10.8 points
per contest and leads the team
with 64 assists and 18 steals. Phil
Gamble is the second guard,
chipping in 15.6 ppg.

Back to the topic of tonight,

UConn over Pitt? Logic in the
'80s says anything can go down
in the goofy Big East. See how
Villanova tripped up Syracuse the
other night? Pitt is the better team
on paper, but the Huskies and
their second-year coach with that
”What if ...” attitude would like
nothing better than to use Pitt as
a stepping stone out of the Big
East cellar.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 13, I988

Slam

Continued from page 7
most importantly, it silenced
those damn hoopies for a short
time.

Most impressive dunk, season:
Demetreus Gore's steal, behind
the back dribble and subsequent
jam just three minutes into the
season-opener against Robert
Morris.

Typical Freakazoid.

Runnerup for most impressive
dunk: Lane's slam off a feed from
Gore at the outset of the Florida
State game.

The dunk was of your basic
one-handed variety, but Rome
did it with authority — one of the
more powerful slams by a Pitt
player since a guy named Sam
Clancy.

Least impressive dunk: Gore's
one-handed dunk from Lane two
nights ago against Duquesne.

You really can't blame Core for
this bore, but everyone is used to
better mid—air antics from him.
The fact Gore was barely able to
dunk it showed the fans how se-
vere his ankle injury has been.

Most impressive dunk attempt:
Smith vs. St. Francis.

Wrestling-

Continued from page 7
Amateur Wrestling News.

Pitt junior Mike Rossi put the
meet away for good by capturing
a decision at 158 pounds, 4-0.

Another bright spot was at 1 77
pounds. Mike Tongel, Pitt's only
senior starter, pulled off a superb
superior decision, winning 13-1.

The last two matches were
awarded to the Panthers because
both Diplomat wrestlers were dis-
qualified for stalling. ”They were
stalling the whole match,” said
Stottlemyer. ”This wasn't a good
shutout. We let them control the
tempo too much. In that respect
we made them look good.”

Morgan State visits the Field
House tomorrow night at 7:30.
Eastern Wrestling League rival Le-
high visits Pitt Monday at 7:30.

Smith went back door late in
the game to try to stuff an alley-
oop pass from Miller, but a St.
Francis player had position. The
result: no foul and Smith came up
limping.

I still can't figure out why Pitt
would try an alley-oop pass
(which is a somewhat risky ad-
venture) with four minutes left in
a 20-oint blowout.

I liked Smith's courage, though.

Least impressive dunk attempt:
Bobby Martin vs. Duquesne.
Wide open, and he blew it. And
he was using two hands. Evans
was, uh, upset. Plus, Martin
received a technical for hanging
on the rim.

I guess the only surprise in this
list is Lane's meager total of only
three jams.

 

Evans constantly berates Lane
in practice for not going to the
basket strongly enough, and
Rome's total is evidence that he
still needs to attack the basket
with more fervor.

Sort of like Charles Smith has
been doing.
