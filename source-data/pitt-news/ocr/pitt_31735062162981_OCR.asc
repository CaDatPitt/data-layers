-High‘ Court Justices

Prepare Interviews ‘

A system for Working rela-
tionship -between subsidiary
courts and the S u p r e m e
Court is the goal of the seven
justices-elect. These seven
students ‘were .appr,ov'ed by
the Senate last Monday.

The_,Jutices-Elect are Ann Abbi-
nanti, Hartwell P. Brown, Ser-
man Fogel, Robert Fulton, Joyce
_ Haney, Barbara Katz -and William
Rodder. The committee selected
Fulton as temporary chairman.

The procedure for establishing
this relationship will be to in-
terview officers and advisers of _

. each subsidiary court. The com-
mittee, also’ has- formulated a.=
‘questionnaire of 23 questions-
that they will give to each court.
A Some of the questions that -will
, *1 be asked are: “Wthat do you feel
‘V’ the relationship between the Su-
preme Court and subsidiary courts
' should be? What is your jurisdic-
tion? What are your p°ast records
of procedure? How has your court
been functioning?" ' ,
With the information, obtained
from the personal interviews and
the questionnaires,‘ the committee

will correlate the information and
present what it feels is a working

-r

a

system to the Student Affairs‘

: "‘tt_"“‘Committee and th_e Senate.

If approval of the proposed
system is obtained, the commit-
tee of Justices-Elect will merge
into the Supreme Court. At that
time, the chief justice will be
chosen‘ by the Student Affairs
Committee. 0
_ Some of the_ courts which will
 -be interviewed are Senior ‘Court
‘ of Assn.

 

nity Court and the me'n and
‘women dorm courts.

  
Here Monday

Mark Starr, labor education ex-
pert, will speak at the Midday
Series program on Monday in the
SU ballroom. Following his talk.
he will conduct an informal dis-
cussion with a student and faculty
group" in the Main Lounge.

_“Moral Issues in the Leader-

~;, s h i p a n d , Administration
' Unions” is the topic upon which
Starr will elaborate. It has been
said thathe isone of the experts
in labor education in the United
States. '
_ Since "1935 Starr has been Ed-
ucational Director of the Inter-'

 

ers’ Union, a. pioneer union "in
the ﬁeld of workers’ education.
For some years Starr has held
‘an executive‘ position in numerous
organizations including: chairman

body. -

Isler’s reason for vetoing the
motion was that sufficient inves-
tigation and discussion had ‘ not
been made_ by the Senate. Isler
said: “There are too many rami-
ﬁcations in an issue as broad as
this to make a decision" in ten
minutes.” Last week the senators
were allowed only ten minutes to
discuss the proposal.

‘Senators Disagree

There was some disagreement
among the senators concerning a
time element being a sufficient
basis for vetoing. Al Garﬁnkel,
senior senator, asserted that he
had not been in favor ‘of'the ten-
minute limited discussion for the
motion which he had introduced.
He said:

"I realized that more than ten
minutes were needed to have a
proper discussion. It would not
have worked anyway because
nine of the fraternities were
against it.” This point-—“.that it
would not have worked—led

- the authority?”

Fred Whittier, director of Ex-
ternal Affairs, spoke in behalf of
interfraternity Council. He wanted
to know how the Senate was able
to single out one organization on
campus and tell them that they
must enforce apolicy proposed by
the student vgovernment. -

Few Others Do It

Stores, which _is the trade or-
ganization of , ‘college bookstores
across the country, reports that
less than five per cent of its mem-

' bers give "student discounts,” Sny-

der continued.
“Carnegie Tech happens to be
one of the exceptions, but the
r-est of the city’s colleges—-Du-
quesne, Chatham and Mount
Mercy—do not offer any sort of
discount to students.” -

At the informal gathering Bol-

subsidization, shoplifting and
‘unfair competition to surround-

the central factors on‘ which the

’’Students are guided by the
misconception that the book store

“But few students realize that all
proﬁts “are replaced in the current
funds of the university and pump-
ed back for student use in lounges,
cafeterias, etc.”
,‘Non-Proﬁt’ Misleading
Boltacz‘ believes that the term
"‘non-proﬁt” is misleading. “Even
‘hospitals make s-ome money,” he
stated, “but it is all fed back into
the organization.” ‘

Prospects for student discounts at the new Book Center
are not very good, according to university ofﬁcials.

Keith Snyder,“ director of Auxiliary Enterprises, and
Paul Boltacz,;Book Center manager, both expressed doubts
as to the possibility of a special student rate.

“We never initiate discounts,” Snyder said Monday. “This

“Another raise in tuition for '

‘Own question, he gestured know-

Referring to his notes Boltacz
then went on to explain that on
the average each student spends
$50 a year on required items --
books and supplies. With the ten:
percent discount, “the, student‘
wouldvhave a savings of only ﬁve,
dollars as things now stand.”
No Money for Store
When asked about state aid,
Bolt-acz admitted that state appro-
priations are granted to the uni-

According to Boltacz, grants

they are given speciﬁcally for
educational purposes by which
the university must abide. “The
book store itself was built on a
loan, which means the univer-

“But the problem of shoplifting‘ C

defeats the discount campaign of-
any reasonable success.” As «it.is,
on a .ten dollar book the store
makes only $1.58 on the sale be-

$.58 on each book. To make up
the loss on one stolen book, 13

Athletic De-emphasis? Not Here

Who says the university is de-
emphasizing athletics? Probably-
no one now, and least of all Chan
cellor Litchfield. '

The probable change in opinion
on the part of critics of any sup-
posed d_e emphasis has come as the
result of a fact presented by Dr.
Litchﬂcld atthe All-Sports Ban-
quet Monday night.

. “Five-years ago the overall
budget for the athletic depart-
ment was $638,000; for 1961 it
will be $900,000,” the chancellor
(revealed. That means the ath-
letic budget has been increased .

   

   
     

  
 

      

The number of full-time coach-
es has beenraised from 13 to 18,
he pointed out, and their salaries
have gone up from $86,000 to
-$125,000. Accordingly, there has
been a 100 percentlincrease in
participation in intramural sports
‘and a 14 percent increase in var-
sity participants. ‘

Dr. Litchﬁeld continued by re-
lating some future highlights for
the sports program. The biggest
surprise was the announcement of
three new varsity sportst‘ fencing,
lacrosse and 15.0-pound football.

wo Tltrauglt .tIte Cycle

, Take a controversial topic, make plans to do something
5about it, discuss it for a few weeks and then it dies.

. i‘ This “cyclical theory” pops up‘ at Pitt periodically.
;The latest examples qf.this theory are the ‘teacher-course
‘evaluation plan and the university’s policy on alcoholic
beverages. _

In the case of the evaluation, the Liberal_Arts Cabinet
, formulated a plan which touched off much discussion
among -both students and faculty. Right now, however, the
,Cabinets, or anyone else’s plan for that matter, appears
* headed for oblivion.

The main difﬁculty has been the lack of agreement on
any single plan. When ideas for evaluation programs have
been brought up, there has been someone to point out the
A . ﬂaws in each of them. .

 No single person or group of persons can-be blamed for
 . the stiﬂing of an evaluation program. It appears now that
‘such a program cannot be devised overnight. Therefore,
, we suggest that the student Senate initiate a joint com-
mittee of students and faculty and perhaps even adminis-
e s gtrative personnel to study the possible future of an evalua-
 tion.
A This committee could work slowly, using the entire
spring trimester if necessary to formulate a program. The
«plan which would evolve from this committee then could
J.-‘be placed in effect next September. -
' ' p The university’s liquor policy presentsa different type
of problem. Here it has been a case of an attempt on the
.part of certain students only to clarify the present policy.
The initial request for clariﬁcation came last October. The
situation is no more lucid today than it was at that time.
_ “ The discussion of the liquor policy has been tossed back
*[and forth from office to ofﬁce. No responsible ofﬁcial is will-
[ing to present any policy statement. And if it were left to
;the discretion of certain officials, the policy—even if it were
stated somewhere——never would be publicized widely.
¢ These persons would have the policy passed around by
2% ‘. word of mouth rather than through any mass media so “out-
"side interests” could. not be aware of any changes that might
be introduced. ' ’
I We are not suggesting any changes be made in the
.j:, , present policy—whatever it is. We merely ‘want a state-
E-‘ment informing the university family of the policy. Such
a statement would answer many of the questions being‘
asked and would solve a number of problems. V

Last Thoughts. . . ;

C)n TTu

By David Breakstone

Somewhere the blue, dark voices are calling
again. It is time to go. But ﬁrst . . .

Out in the melting Northwest, a classmate, Jay
Butler, impatiently awaits an ‘answer to his ques-
tion: “How has four years in
school made you a wise man?”

I sit and think.

We are none of us wise, Jay,
least of all I. If there _is any-
thing that I do know, it is prob-
ably how much I do not knowe
not a particularly original
thought, but nonetheless a valid
one. Moreover, I know nothing
with certainty and realize how
little I can quietly sit around .
and even doubt. ' A

This does not mean that I haveho system of
values or that I am suspending judgment for the
sake of detachment and non-committment. Rather,
my ideas and values tend to be plastic, changing as
I see more of the truth, crystallizing as experience
reinforces ideal theory.

With Reason. but Challenge

That We, as a body, are conservative, I would
attribute to a relativistic, increasingly unmoral
civilization. This does not excuse the conservatism,
but makes the challenge to believe in something
positive and‘ organic all the more real. _

My .own answer is_ to pursue Coleridge’s
“changeful god,” representing the multiform truth,
in a variety of tentative ways until I can ‘learn
the ,legendary “good way unto.which a man should
cleave.” Whether that changeful god resides in the
“river, the lion, or the ﬂame,” I ‘must follow it
until the alternate forms coalesce into_ one. .

I think that while there may be more knowl-
edge behind me‘to_day than four years ago, virtu-
ally all of the wisdom lies ahead." That is, Jay, a

certiﬁcate for 124 credits cannot in any quantitative

or qualitative way confer wisdom, even‘ a drop, to
the "bearer. Those 124 credits, on the other hand,
may say something about the education imparted.
I am not sure. ’

With increasing importance being given to an
objective (machine-made) evaluation of the edu-
cational process (isn't thata chillingly meaningless ‘
phrase?), students are rated, prizes given, on the
basis of what the machine-mind says.

Automatic Commencement

E

Graduates Mix, Educate . . .
rgamzmg an
By Ina Arndvur '

Khrushchev’s visit to the United States caused
some un-expected occurences at the university.
Eight ‘students were invited to the luncheon in
Khrushchev’s honor, but not one of them was a
graduate student. .

When certain members of the administration
were asked if a graduate student _
couldlgo, they seemed to be a "
little surprised to know that such
anomalies existed. It was this

event that prompted a group of
graduate students to organize

 

    
  
   
   
 

represent the graduate student 
body. ' A

‘Tomorrow a temporary coun- 
cil will be elected whose duty it ‘
will be to set up the permanent
regular graduate student organi- _ ~
zation. The membership of this temporary council
will be determined on a proportional basis, and each
division of the university which admits graduate
students will have at least one representative.

It will meet once a month until it has the

permanent graduate student V organization sut‘ﬁ- ,
ciently organized so that it can operate effectively
in the fall. . " ' -

Multifold Objectives , .
Since this idea has not been'tried before at the
university, it might be helpful if the graduate stu.
dents would ‘attend tomorrow’s meeting. The ob-
jectives ofathe organization should be beneﬁcial to
the general graduate student. I‘
These objectives include the attempts to broaden
student activities, to represent graduate’ students
to the university Senateand to make public infor-
mation on fellowships, and degree requirements.

However, these formal objectives are not half
so important as the informal opportunities which
some type of graduate student organization can
offer. Most graduate students seem to know and
associate only with graduate students in their own

same criteria. When does the modern student
ever have to demonstrate what he knows or what
-he may have accidentally picked up along the way?
Rarely, if ever, here.

-With childlike faith in a -set of untested as-
sumptions, the institution runs merrily along like
the theory of the perpetual clock universe. Some-
one, presumably with authority, wound up the
universe a long time ago, and it has been running
unaided EVER since. Also the university. This
university. -

More scientiﬁcally (that is also a modern fetish 9“
-— scientism) education as seen in the classroom
tends, Jay, to be more abstract, less, vital, in-
creasingly academic, in the sense of being paro-
chial. I commented a few weeks ago that no one
has the temerity to askquestions in the classroom
anymore. -

This, I think, is pretty close to the heart of the
diﬂiculty. ‘Without a trace of intellectual give and
take, the classhoom becomes a gloriﬁed nursery
where the uninitiated come to down what they
have paid for. Were Alfred North Whitehead still
ruminating around today’ he might wonder about
some of his “Aims of Education” as they are mis.-2 
represented here. I am talking about mechanism
without guiding thought.

Partial Attainment

Yes, you say, but what about you, personally?
'You, the omnipresent critical, perceptive student?
Well, Jay, let me tell you about that checkered
careerin no particular order. Navigating through
the four years was a calculated, intense-adventure.

Itwas designed to be eﬁective and uncheckered. ‘

I only partially succeeded now that I« think aboutit.

The less than total success of my sojourn ‘here _ ,1
probably stems from having played the game ac-‘ W“
cording to the book. I took too many suggestions,
fulﬁlled too many assignments,-'acc'epted too many-
opinions or‘ judgments uncritically. ‘There appears’
to be a happy medium in this formal business of
diploma-winning. You‘ can’t tell. the referees how
to play their own game: “Sir, you don’t know how g
to teach English 2.", " _,

But conversely, agreeing with everything that
the glib and dogmatic professorial voice- intbnes
conceals pitfalls of its own. Sometimes you wake
up and wonder, “Now just what do I think?”

There is'an element of choice: in education, and .,.Jan

students aware of one another’s existence, could
very well serve to integrate groups of students _
who would normally not -bother to become. ac-7?’ 
duainted. This could make graduate school a '
more meaningful and educative experience for? 

  

Spontaneous Specializing ., ’ .

As ‘far as social activities for the graduate stu-
dents, most of them would be informal and spon-
taneous. If enough graduate .students would sup-
port this endeavor, the organization might be able
to procure a lounge located some place in. the
Cathedral. The lounge, a place where thestudents
would congregate, could also contain a ‘bulletin
board announcing any scheduled activities. A

It could be open at all times, and some sort of
food could be available. Occasionally luncheonsi
could be arranged at a desegregated restaurant to
which a speaker of interest to all.graduate students
could be invited. . - 4 '
v _ Academically, the organization also would ap-
pear to have merit. Again, if itis supported, panel I 
discussions will be planned where perhaps students
from_,variou's disciplines can discuss their varied
approaches to a particular problem.
Trieklings from‘ Tuition V

Although now this organization is being sup-
ported ﬁnancially by the administration, if it should
succeed next year, the money to support the or- *3
ganization’s functions will come directly from the ' ‘
graduate students’ tuition. _ '

If all graduate students would show an interest “V 
and attend the initial organization meeting tomor-
row at 5 p.m., the success of such an endeavor
could have very favorable results for the graduate.
school. A f g

The students would have some representation , 
at the university senate, and would thereby possess
some means of voicing complaints and suggestions.
This is the only way in which the various gradu-
ate schools can be improved. A

Also by causing graduate students to have more_~;..
opportunities to meet with each other, the.students 4'

Dr. Litchﬁeld
Steals Sh/ow At
Sports Banquet

By TED COLTON

- ; Last Monday the Pitt All-Sport Banquet was held at
the Student Union Ball Room. The two and a half hour affair
was one of the most successful Sport Banquets held here at
the university. Pitt’s three major awards were presentedoin
addition to the Most Valuable Player Awards in each in-

dividual sport that has completed its season.

The top awards were given to Dick Chadwick, Athletic

Award, Bill Lindner, Charles Hartwig Award and Tom Hall,

Pitt News Award. Besides the presentations of _awards, the
banquet featured three speakers who did a ﬁne Job.
Governor David Lawrence, Mayor Joseph Barr and Dr.
Edward Litchﬁeld were the main speakers, Mayor Barr and
Governor Lawrence paid tribute to Athletic Director Frank

-‘Carver and the Pitt athletic teams.

Mr. Lawrence showed what side of the fence he was
on when he stated, “Two of my most memorable oc_ca-
sions in sports last year were when Pitt beat the .Il‘lS_h
and Penn State.” He went on to include that Pitt is

_ getting better in every sport and should have.‘ a great
year in 1960-61. He closed with, The sports writers are
going to have the _best time ,they ever had writing about
Panther victories next year. ’

_ 1'11, have to go along with the Governor on that one.
Looking back over this year and then seeing what we have

I ‘coming back in 1960 and ’61, I can’t help but seeing a tre-

mendous year for the football, basketball, wrestling, base-

ball and soccer teams.

iAlthough the Governor did a ﬁne job the man who
stole the show was Chancellor Litchﬁeld. After Toast-
master Ray Scott had “threatened” Dr. Litchfield by stat-
ing that he was going to enter _the university next fall
because he needed a new car. Litchﬁeld replied, If you
’ are going to apply, you better not wait until the year
after next.” (This statement drew a hearty. round of
laughter. I hope for sophomores’ sake that our Chan-
cellor was only kidding.) ‘ "

Litchﬁeld went on to speak about excelling. He pointed
out what the Athletic department has accomplished in the
past years. Then he spoke of the future. He outlined an 11
million dollar plan to expand athletic facilities. The project
will take place on the hill near the present Field House. The
new structure will include tennis courts, a swimming pool

and many other facilities. E

, The Chancellor also went into the sport budget. (See
story on front page.) The whole program put on by Mr.

V Carver -and the athletic department was a major success.

lCats Ready to Move Outside;
Lewis-May Use Black Balls

By JACK SMITH

The Panther baseball nine
is almost as unpredictable as
the weather. At times the“
mitters have shown signs of
a tight inﬁeld. And at times
it appears that Coach Bobby

Lewis will have a job ‘molding a
team into shape by April 9.

Of course since the weather has
changed the Panthers may have a

chance to escape the dark conﬁnes
of "the Field 

House. “This is g
the only w a y ,
we c a n t e l l _
what we__have
and how to im-
prove on 2 it,”
Lewis ‘said. If ‘
the . w e a t h e r
holds, and this
is s a id with ‘

 

t h e m i t t e r s
could j be out-
side ’ toward the end, of the week.

Even if it should snow Lewis
promises to move outside. “If we
can’t do anything else we will
paint black lines on the ﬁeld and
play with a, black ball.”

Snow shoes will be required
also,” Lewis said. “Seriously, we
need to move outside before we
can test. ounstrength."

About the only proven ﬁclders
that Lewis has are: Jerry Matu-
levic, Nick Kartsonas, Ron Ma-
ser and Pete Colangelo.

Matulevic is the leading hitter

Leading this 1960 net group
will be Dave Mason, who com-

EAT, DRINK AND BE MARRIED

‘On a recentrtour of seventy million Americancolleges, .1 was _,

struck by two outstanding facts: ﬁrst, the great number of
students who smoke Marlboro, and second, the great number
of students who are married.

The first phenomenon—-the-.' vast multitude of Marlboro
smokers—comes as no surprise for, as everyone knows, the
college student is an enormously intelligent organism, and what
could be more intelligent than to smoke Ma.rlboro‘?‘After all,
pleasure is «wha.t_you smoke for and pleasure is what Marlboro

' delivers-—pleasure in every puff of that good golden tobacco.
-If you think ﬂavor wentout when ﬁlters came in—try a

Marlboro. Light up and see for yourself ,..Or, if you ‘like, don’t
light up. Just take a. Marlboro, unlighted, and puff a couple of
times. Get that wonderful ﬂavor? You bet you do! Even witli-
out lighting you can taste Marlboro’s excellent ﬁlter blend.
Also you can make your package. last practically forever.

‘ No, I say, it was not the great number of Marlboro smokers

that astounded me, it was the great number of married students. , .

You may ﬁnd this hard to believe .but latest statistics show that‘
at some coeducational colleges the proportion of married under-
graduates runs as high as thirty percent-l And, what is even
more startling, fully one-quarter of these ma.rria.ges have been
blessed with issue! V _,

Here now is a. ﬁgure ‘to give you pause! Not that we don’t
all love babies. Of coursegwe do! Babies are pink and fetching
rascals, given to winsome noises and droll expressions, and we
all like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little
skulls. -But just the same, to the young campus couple who are
parents for theﬁrst time thebaby is likely to be 9. source of
considerable worry.‘ Therefore, let me devote today's column
to a few helpfulliints on the care of babies. '

  

First of all, we will take’ up the matter of diet. In the past,
babies were raised largely on tablescraps. This, however, was
outlawed by the Smoot-Hawley Act, and today babies are fed
a scientiﬁc formula consisting of dextrose, maltose, distilled
waterfevaporated milk and a twist of lemon peel.

After eating, the baby tends to grow sleepy. A lullaby is very '

useful to help itsfall asleep. Indcase you don’t know any lulla-
bies, make one up. This is not at all difficult. In a lullaby the
words are unimportant since the baby doesn’t understand them
anyhow. The important thing is the sound. All you have to do
is string together a bunch of nonsense syllables, taking care
that they make an agreeable sound. For example:
' Go to sleep, my li'tt.le infant, ‘
G'oo—goo moo-moo poo-poo binfcmt.

Having fed and serenaded the baby, arrange it in the position
for slumber. A baby sleeps best on its stomach so place it that
way in its crib. Then to make sure it will not turn itself over
during the night lay a soft but fairly heavy object on its back—-
another baby, for instance. @ 1060 M... Shulmal

And when baby is fast asleep—the little angel!—why don’t
you relax and give yourself a treat? With Marlboro—or if you
like mildness but you don't like ﬁlters—with Philip Morris

Lettermen May Break
Records for T hinclads

» Feeling is running high among the track coach that this
- could be the year that the Panthers break many long stand-

!

ing track and ﬁeld records.

_ The Cats have a good crop of lettermen that did well. last
year and are showing signs of improving. “Some of our’ in-
door performances have helped to make us optimistic,”

Coach Carl Rees said. 9 A

_One of the main reason for
Rees’ future look isADan Kanell.
Kanell, a 6-5, 230 pound senior,
has showirsigns of breaking the
existing discuss throw record of
169 feet three inches set by .Wes
King in 1958. He isn't far from
that record right now and accord-
ing to Rees, Kanell could beat the
record and then some.

Then there is Ron Rush in
both the mile and two mile.
«“'I_‘here isn't a question in‘ my
mind that Bush will break‘ both
of these records,” Rees com-
mented.‘ “In the AAU meet last
week he unoiﬁcially broke the
two mile mark and has every-
thing it takes to cart off both of
these records.” 

In another ﬁeld event the Pan-
thers have Ed Vamos-.

- the Cats’ best broad jumper and
- did 23 feet one inch this year in

indoor competition. Last year he

did 23.7 and should be capable of .

25 feet.

The Panther record for the shot i
set by John"

put was 51’ 41/2"
Bazyk in 1941. Rees’ big man in
this event is Larry Och. In an
indoor meet Och clipped that dis-
tance by heaving the 16 pound
round ball. 51’ 71,12": Och and
others give the cinder coach rea-
sons to smile.

all university-wide student activi-
', ties;

’ ' Second, that IF undertake a
study on the possibility of a
university policy of deferred
rushing of first trimester stu-
dents; and third, that IE sub-
mit the results or recommenda-
tions of this study to the Senate
no later than the end of the Fall
trimester, 1960.

I At that time the Senate will
act 'on the matter as it deems
wise. The motion was unanimous-
