Study abroad takes precautions

By Jennifer Swoboda
Staﬂ" W1-iter

Pitt students studying abroad
are taking extra precautions to
stay safe since war began in the
Middle East.

“With the crisis going in the
Middle East, the need for
international understanding is
more important now than ever,”
said Annagene Yucas, Ph.D.,
director of the University Center
for International Studies’ study

1 abroad office.

Some students have cancelled
trips or returned home from
studying abroad because of the
gulf war, Yucas said. She said
that those students who have
pulled out of study-abroad

programs have done so because
of their own concerns, not the
university's.

“We had two students not
participate this semester due to
terrorist concerns. One was to go
to Spain and the other to Eastern
Europe,” Yucas said.

The itinerary for Semester at
Sea was changed last year due to
the talk of a potential conﬂict, but
that was before the war erupted,
said Yucas. The ship set sail last
Sunday. There was a total of six

v cancellations; two were due to

health reasons and the other four
were concerned about travel
safety, according to Yucas.

The Semester at Sea program
has taken several precautions and
has prepared for evacuations if

necessary, Yucas said. Students
were advised not to go into
densely populated areas and not
to wear clothing with university
logos.

“We are monitoring the
situation very carefully,” said
Yucas. “Travel advisories come
to us as they are released to us
and also through the directors of
other programs at other schools.”

Three Pitt students are currently
in Israel, and two of them have
been there since last semester.
The third student left in January
for Tel Aviv, said Yucas.

According to Yucas, the families
of the two students who left last
semester say their children do
not intend to come home until
their study there is completed.

Peace group organizes
blood drive for troops

By Eric Hoch

Whether students agree or disagree with U.S. involvement in
the Persian Gulf, they will have the chance to show their support
for the troops bygiving blood this Friday.

The blood drive, sponsored by Students for Peace and run by
Central Blood Bank, will be held in the Forbes Quad lobby from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

“We feel this is a positive way to show your support for anyone
involved in this war,” said Matthew Weiss, a Carnegie Mellon

that even if we don’t support the war, we do support the troops.”

According to Terri Glueck, public-relations manager of Central
Blood Bank, the blood may not get over to the gulf because the
military has put a temporary hold on demands for blood.

“We supply them with what they need. As of last Wednesday
they put us on hold,” said Glueck. “Should a ground war start,
then we would most likely be asked to send blood.”

Glueck said that the military gets its blood from its own blood
program and the Red Cross. Private blood banks, like Central
Blood Bank, supply blood when needed.

If the need arises, the blood will be sent to McGuire Air Force
Base in New Jersey, and then the military would send the blood
wherever it was needed, according to Glueck.

“The blood may even go to areas in the United States where
people who normally donate have been sent to the gulf. This
would be through the American Association of Blood Banks, of
which Central Blood Bank is a member. This would take care of
the loss of needed blood here in the states,” Glueck said.

Weiss got the idea to have Students for Peace, formerly Students
Against the War, sponsor a blood drive from a friend who thought
that giving blood for the troops would be a good way to show
support.

“I agreed with her," said Weiss. “This blood drive will show that
people have not written off the troops, and that people are not
selfish in that they don’t support the troops. This blood drive is
to show just the opposite; people do support the troops.”

Weiss said that students wishing to give blood can walk in
during the blood drive or call Central Blood Bank to make an
appointment.

Draﬁ may resume if war in the Middle East continues

By Stacey J akubowski
For The Pitt News

It is highly likely that a draft will be
instituted if the war continues and there
are a signiﬁcant number of casualties,
according to Marion Damick, chairperson
of a local draft board.

If the draft is reinstated, Congress will
pass a law giving it the authority to draft
people. The same day, a lottery will be
held to give a priority number to each
birth date in the year. Men turning 20 years
old in the present calendar year will
probably be called first.

The next day, Mailgrams will be sent to
registrants whose birth dates were given
low lottery numbers.

Draftees will have 10 days to report for
active military duty from the date the
Mailgram is sent and have less than 10
days to file for deferments and exemptions.

Darnick believes the government can
get the draft into operation within six
months because men are already registered
for the draft and the draft boards are in
place.

“In World War II the registration and
draft boards did not exist, and the
government got the draft into effect in less

than six months, so now it could be done
in an extremely short time," said Damick,

She said deferments will be available if
there is a draft.

“The draft board exists to discuss appeals
made by people who want to avoid being
drafted,” Damick said.

Deferments and exemptions include
these categories: hardship and dependency
(obtained only in extreme cases), ministers
and ministerial students, medical students
(they will probably face a doctor draft
once they become doctors), physical and
moral unsuitability, and surviving sons
(because of a military-related death of an

immediate relative in or before the Vietnam
War).

People refusing to register for the draft
risk facing up to five years in jail and/or a
fine of $10,000.

“In the Vietnam War a number of people
went to jail for refusal to register for the
draft, ” said Damick. “Now the requirements
have been much more liberalized, and the
draft- board people I have met seem to be
very reasonable and very conscientious
people.” ,

According to 1981 government statistics,
over 800,000 young men nationwide have

University attempts to prevent quick closing of basic classes

By Jennifer Skriba
Sta_ﬁ" wruer

Registering for classes always
seems to be accompanied by
anxiety and frustration among
Pitt students, faculty and advisers
because of the large number of
closed classes, especially in
general—education requirements,
such as General Writing and
Algebra.

“Everybody admits there is a

problem, and everybody tries to
work out a way to relieve that
problem,” said Katheryn M.
Linduff, associate dean for
academic affairs in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and professor
of fine arts.

The problem of closed classes
is a complex one. The number of
classes allotted for each
requirement is a prediction based
on several changing variables, in
which the actual number of

students is greater than the
anticipated number, according to
Linduff.

First, the number of transfer
students and students from branch
campuses of the university that
are admitted is difficult to predict
and varies from term to term.

Other problems, including late
admissions and students arriving
and registering late, make it even
harder to determine the number
of classes needed.

“There is no way to anticipate
all of that," said Linduff.

In the current term, figures were
off because the retention rate, or
the number of students staying at
the university, was up and the
dropout rate was down, according
to Linduff.

“We don’t get final-enrollment
figures until well into the term
we're teaching,” she said.

Students have two years to fulfill
their General Writing

requirement. “Part of their
argument is to try to balance the
number of students who take it in
the fall vs. the number of students
who take it in the lspringl,” said
Fred Koloc, director of advising
for the College of Arts and
Sciences.

According to Mary L. Briscoe,
dean of CAS, about 40 percent of
entering freshmen must take Basic
Writing, and about 51 or 52

Bush urges Congress to support troops

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

In his State of the Union Address
last night, President Bush told
Congress to stand behind the
troops in the Persian Gulf.

Bush said that the country is
involved in a “great struggle in
the skies, seas and sands” of the
Persian Gulf. He said that
American leadership is crucial to
the world’s ﬁght against Saddam
Hussein’s “tyranny.” “The hope
of humanity rests with us,” he
said.

The President restated the three
main goals of U.S. presence in
the Persian Gulf: as: to drive the
Iraqis out of Kuwait, to reinstate
the legitimate government of
Kuwait and to ensure stability in
the Persian Gulf region.

Though he was interrupted 45
times for ovations during this
speech, the loudest applause
came in support of the troops in
the Gulf. Bush said, “No one is
more devoted to freedom than
the armed forces,” and a two-

minute standing ovation ensued
for the troops.

In other war developments:

-In an unusual development,
the United States and Soviet Union
made a joint statement about the
conflict yesterday. They made two
proposals: first, if Saddam Hussein
says he will pull out of Kuwait,
then there will be a cease-fire.
Secondly, after the conflict is
resolved, there will be a
conference on the Palestinian
issue.

This is something that the United
States has refused to connect with
this crisis.

-Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein claimed, yesterday that
Iraqi ground forces had thrust 10
miles into northwest Saudi Arabia.
The Pentagon said that it knows
nothing about this attack. The

Iraqi military command said that
it had seized weapons and
ammunition in the raid and killed
“large numbers” of enemy forces.

In an interview with Cable News
Network’s Peter Arnett, Saddam
also said that he would not use
more weapons more than the
equivalent of what the allies are
using against his country.

When asked to clarify his
statement, he said that he would
use what he felt would make the
fighting equal. He also claimed to
still possess the power to place
chemical and biological warheads
on his Scud missiles. Saddam
also claimed to have nuclear
capability in that area, something
that allied forces had previously
said he did not have.

-United States Marines took
part in an artillery barrage
yesterday that supposedly
destroyed some Iraqi outposts
and bunkers inside Kuwait.
Marines from the first Marine
division participated in the
barrage.

-Environmental experts from

around the world have arrived in
the Persian Gulf to determine the
best way to deal with the huge oil
slick in the water there. The
Pentagon estimated that over 11
million barrels, or about 300
million gallons of oil, were
dumped into the gulf Saturday by
Iraqi troops.

One effect that the oil could
have on Saudi Arabia besides
damaging its coastline is
damaging the desalinization
procedures. The Saudis take water
from the gulf for drinking
purposes. Experts say that the oil
slick could have more damaging
effects on those procedures than
originally anticipated.

oThe peace demonstrations in
front of the White House are
beginning to disturb President
Bush.

There were reports that the
president was unable to sleep
because of the constant beating
of drums by protesters, although
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said he thought the
drum beats were “kind of nice.”

By Sept. 1, 1983, there were

percent of freshmen place into
Algebra.

In the past eight years the
number of students in under-
graduate classes has been steadily
increasing, causing the ratio of
students to faculty to increase.

“We don’t have sufficient
numbers of faculty to cover all of
these needs,” said Linduff. “Any
increase in staff costs money, and
unless you get it, you can’t
possibly solve the problem. It’s
frustration on both sides —— faculty
and students.”

The problem of the allocation
of resources to CAS is also
apparent in the physical
limitations of buildings and lab
equipment. Koloc expressed a
hope that the new president
would allocate more resources to
CAS.

“There is certainly a feeling in
CAS and FAS that this part of the
university has not fared as well
financially under [Pitt President
Wesley] Posvar’s administration.”

Koloc and Linduff said there
are clearly some courses that need
to be more available to students,
especially General Writing, W-
courses and Algebra.

As an adviser, Koloc em-
phasized that it is important for
students to bring these registration
problems to his attention. “I think
the university is generating a fair
amount of ill will and student
frustration,” he said.

“I would hope that the students
would see the faculty as trying to
do their best and also as [being]
aware of the problem,” said
Linduff. “We make progress bit
by bit, but it's slower than the
need.”

By Jeff Shurilla
For The Pitt News

It was 3 p.m. at the ﬁeld house, a half hour before
basketball practice and 25 hours since Pitt’s worst
shooting performance this season, Sunday against
Georgetown. Jason Matthews and Sean Miller had
arrived early to practice their shots.

This was no lackadaisical shoot—around. These guys
were intense. Three-pointers were the drill for the day,
an attempt to try to improve on Sunday's dismal 39-
percent shooting against the Hoyas.

The two kept shooting and shooting and shooting,
taking turns attempting sets of 10 and 15 shots. They
consistently made seven out of 10, making four, ﬁve,
six in a row. Miller and Matthews were trying to
improve on the Panthers’ recent three-point slump. In
three of the past four games, Pitt has averaged 28
percent from three-point land, well below its season
percentage of .405.

“I think a lot of the trouble with our [team] percentage
is with the guards,” said Miller, who, combined with
Matthews, shot four for 18 against Georgetown. “I
think me and Jason have to get back on track and get
our percentage up to help the team.”

The first results of the renewed shooting dedication
will be in at about 10 p.m. tonight when Pitt (15-5, 4-
3 in the Big East) travels to the Spectrum in Philadelphia
to take on the Villanova Wildcats (10-8, 3-4). Pitt won
the ﬁrst meeting at the Civic Arena, 87-76, on Jan. 2
shooting 46 percent from the floor, just below its
current season average of 48 percent.

As a team, Pitt’s shooting has been consistently just
under 50 percent all year, but has recently developed
a trend that could be a concern heading into the
middle of the Big East schedule. In eight of the last 10
games the Panthers’ percentage has dropped from the
first half to the second half, in contrast to seven of their
first 10 games, when they improved after halftime.

One of the most notable drops was in the loss to
Georgetown, when the Panthers fell from 50 percent
in the first half to only 27 percent in the second.

“Teams are just making defensive adjustments at
halftime,” said Matthews. “I guess we have to make
more of our own offensive adjustments. We have to
maybe move some more people around.”

In tonight’s game the Panthers may get their touch
back by watching Villanova’s Greg Woodard, who is
currently leading the Big East with a 45.8-percent
accuracy from three-point range in all games played.

Big East players stand tall at NBA draft time

The Big East Conference could actually
have the most players drafted by the NBA
this year since the pros went to the two— '
round system in 1988. Last year four Big
East players were drafted: Derrick Coleman
(New Jersey Nets), Tate George (New

Derek
Wﬂlis

along with Pitt’s Chris McNeal.

As long as we're speaking of the future
 While Pitt and Syracuse were able to
keep some regional recruits within the
conference, a lot of New York and New
England high- school players went

Jersey Nets) and Jayson Williams (now
with the Philadelphia 76ers) in the ﬁrst round, and Abdul
Sharnsid-Deen (Dallas Mavericks) in the second.

In 1989 and 1988 ﬁve players were picked for each year. But
this year, with the almost certain defections of Alonzo Mourning
and Billy Owens, the Big East could have six players taken:
Owens, Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo (who is a senior), Brian
Shorter, Eric Murdock and Jason Matthews. Matthews and
Murdock have improved their games enough to warrant attention
from plenty of teams.

One player whose name is missing is Bobby Martin. After
starting out well, his ﬁnger injury will severely hamper his
chances of being picked, but teams will still have interest in a 6-
foot-9 forward with Martin's skills.

Actually, it isn't a great year for seniors in the Big East, as there
are lots of talented juniors. If Owens and Mourning were to stay,
they would join Chris Smith of Connecticut, and Malik Sealy and
Rob Werdann of St. John's as possible NBA picks for 1992.

In addition, several sophomores have professional basketball
futures. Terry Dehere of Seton Hall, Scott Burrell of Connecticut
and Lance Miller and Calvin Byrd of Villanova all come to mind,

elsewhere this year. A few examples: 6-8
Andre Riddick of Brooklyn, who signed with Kentucky; 6-8
Malik Russell, also of Brooklyn, headed for Notre Dame; and 6-
4 guard David Mascia of Lynbrook, N.Y., who signed with LSU.

Still, the Big East did its share of recruiting around the country,
thanks to national television exposure.’ Both Syracuse and Pitt
inked players from Texas, while UConn didn't bother to recruit
in state and got players from Arizona, Georgia and Washington.

Georgetown remains one Big East school virtually shut out in
recruiting. The Hoyas received only one verbal commitment,
from 6-8 Don Reid of Maryland. Reid is not among the nation's
top 150 players. Boston College is also ﬁnding it slow going after
bringing in four freshmen this year, and Villanova has a similar
problem.

What Connecticut needs right about now is a point guard, but
there isn’t one within miles of the Storrs, Conn., campus. Chris
Smith and John Gwynn both make terriﬁc shooting guards, but
neither has the vision and patience to run an offense. Coach Jim
Calhoun had hoped that Israel native Gilad Katz would be able
to take over the job, but Katz is strictly a shooter, too.

Lacrosse club
warms up for
1991 season

By Spencer Borisoff
Staﬂ" Writer

Bitter winter nights in Pittsburgh are
known for causing things to freeze up, not
heat up. The cold conﬁnes of Pitt Stadium,
however, has had the opposite effect on
the University of Pittsburgh's lacrosse team.

The club, which captured the Allegheny
Lacrosse League title last spring, has begun
to warm up for the coming season by
practicing at the stadium four nights per
week.

All team members are likewise fired up
to retain the title that they earned last
season. ‘

According to Coach Gary Neft, a former
lacrosse player at Ohio Wesleyan University
and a former coach at Mount Lebanon
High School, Pitt’s reputation as a lacrosse
power has increased tremendously in the
past year.

“From what I've heard from all of the
talk around the league, we're the team to
beat this year," Neft said.

Topping the list of all teams that Pitt
must conquer in order to remain league
champions are Slippery Rock University,
West Virginia University, Mellon University
and Washington & Jefferson.

One reason why Pitt promises to bully
opponents around this season is that the
team boasts much more depth this year
than it has in prior seasons.

“This year we're much deeper,” Neft
said. “More players are coming to practice,
which in turn allows us to be more
thoroughly prepared for game situations.

"We run full scrimmages against
ourselves in practice now. Depth will help
us considerably,” he added.

Sophomore midﬁelder Ed Croot concurs,
“We're a much more solid team this year,
even though a few key starters from last
year's team won't be back.”

Neft also attributes the high expectations
for his team this spring to the fact that Pitt
played a full nine-game schedule last fall.

Pitt posted a 5-4 mark last autumn while
facing extremely talented teams such as
Bowling Green, one of the best club
lacrosse squads in the country, and the
University of Michigan, a highly touted
Division III lacrosse power.

Neft realizes that just because the Pitt lax
club is deeper and more talented than it
has ever been doesn't mean the club can
relax while preparing for their upcoming
season.

“I'm expecting to have a better team this
year but not necessarily a better record
because our schedule is much tougher
this spring,” Neft said.

‘Even though we're still a club, a good
bit of our games are against Division III
teams, unlike last year,” he continued.

Spearheading the Panther lax-attack this
season will be the quick-sticking and
hard—hitting captains Eric Weber, Harper
Watters and Lee Stember.

“People look up to Lee and Eric," Neft
said. ‘I've chosen them as captains because
they're role models to the younger players.”

Pitt plays the ﬁrst of 15 games on Feb. 23
at West Virginia University and can be
seen in action at Pitt Stadium in their
second game of the season on Feb. 27
against Slippery Rock University.

Activist Harvard Law Prof to address Pitt students

By Lane Hornfeck
Staﬂ" Writer

Law Professor Derrick A. Bell Jr. informed Harvard
University last April that he would be forced to take a
leave of absence if no minority female faculty members
were given tenure.

At the closing of the term he took a leave of absence
without pay to protest the university’s inability to diversify
the faculty.

As the firstblack dean of a major law school and the first
black professor given tenure at Harvard, Bell has quite a
heavy load to carry. On Feb. 1, Bell will be speaking at
Pitt about the topical issue of the Civil Rights bill in today’s
society.

“I will be talking about the relative impotence of civil-
rights laws as we now know them given the fact that
racism provides a major stabilizing force in society,” Bell
said.

“The top ﬁfth of the incomes in this country [totals]
more than the bottom four ﬁfths put together. Now a lot

from his position until Harvard

faculty member tenure. This is not

the first time Bell has taken a stand
for minority rights.

of the people in the bottom four ﬁfths are people colored,
black, but most of them are white. The disparity of the
overall wealth is not the subject of revolt or revolution.
The problem is that too many whites on the bottom are
willing to identify with those on top simply on the basis
of race. Then lthe whites] accepting the role as keeping
the blacks below them.”

By coming to Pitt, Bell is acting as a role model to not
only minority students, but to whites as well.

“I feel I should pay back all of those students who ever
raised cane before. I would not be at Harvard if it were

not for those students who fought for themselves,” said
Bell. “I owe it to blacks and whites alike to get greater
diversity on these faculties."

Therefore, Bell has positioned himself as a role model
for minority students.

"The basis of my protest was not to pressure faculty, but
to encourage and support students who have been trying
to get some results for the last few years,” Bell said.

In dealing with the ineptitude of the Civil Rights bill,
Bell is forcing society to see that the problem does not
simply lie at the level of poverty.

According to Bell, “At present, whites make up the
majority of most faculties in this country. If you don’t see
anything wrong with that, then I guess that it is hopeless.

“It is bad enough that corporate and governmental
America is mainly white, but one would think that where
the life of the mind is supposed to prevail, where the
consideration of ethics and morality are supposed to win
out over greed and profit, that the [minority situation]
would be of greater concern.”

THE PIT!’ NEWS, Black History Month Preview, Wednesday, January 30, 1991

By Christopher McCall
Staﬂ’ Writer

”If a race has no history, if it
has no worthwhile tradition, it
becomes a negligiblefactorin the
thoughtoftbe wand, and itstands
in dangerof being exterminated. ”

—Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the
“Father of Black History.”

To many, Black History Month
is more than a celebration of
African-American culture; it is an
educational tool that benefits
everyone.

“I think of Black History Month
as a cultural and spiritual kickoff
for the year," said Douglas Ligons,
chairperson of the Black Action
Society. “For many people, the
year begins on Jan. 1. My year
begins in February. The cultural,
social and political programs that
[BAS has] scheduled give me the
knowledge and strength to live

1 throughout the year.”

Ligons sees the month as a
chance for African-Americans to
learn about their history, an

opportunity that he
said is seldom
offered in main-
stream educational
facilities.

“If you don’t
know your history,
then you don’t
know where you’re
going,” he said. “It's
like if history were a

We need to view things from an
Afrocentric perspective. An Afro-
centric perspective puts us in the
center and puts everything else, like
European history, on the outside.

- Marcus Guy

“Every month
within the school
system something
should be taught
in every subject
about the
contributions of
African—Americans
and other ethnic
groups,” she said.

Without a

line, You need two   9’

points to make a

line: your history and the present.
If you have no history then you’re
just a point, and you could go
anywhere, but you couldn’t
progress.”

“We need to view things from
an Afrocentric perspective,” said
BAS member Marcus Guy. “An
Afrocentric perspective puts us
in the center and puts everything
else, like European history, on
the outside.”

Schools for the most part teach
history from a Eurocentric
perspective, which can exclude
many of the contributions of
African- Americans and African

culture to American society.

“I didn’t know anything about
African culture until I got to
college,” said Jan Darby, a 43-
year-old social worker. “I found
out that black culture is a beautiful
thing and not just a bunch of
natives running around naked,
which is what I had always
thought. I found out that African
culture is something that I should
be proud of.”

Brenda Berrian, Ph.D., of the
black studies department, says
that the contributions of all ethnic
groups in the United States should
be taught in schools.

Bell

Continued from page P-1

Diversifying the faculties of
these institutions may be the
answer, but according to Bell, “It
should be done simply because it
should be done.”

Bell used the example of a
basketball team to further explain.

“If you see an all-black
basketball team, your first reaction
is wondering why isn’t there a
white player on the team. The
true problem is that in society, 20
to 25 percent are minority. The
major institutions are primarily
white.”

Even today, universities are
deliberately refusing to hire on
the basis of race, he said. “How
else is it supposed to happen?”
said Bell.

As a University of Pittsburgh
law graduate, Bell can see the
differences between the decades.

According to Bell, “It was worse
in terms of racial [issues] between
then and now. I was the only
black in the class of ‘'57. There
were no women students and no
women faculty. Law school was a
lot different.”

Bell is still on his leave of
absence because the university
still has not hired a tenured
minority female professor.

Being an activist, Bell is
attempting to “raise cane" so that,
in the future, minority students
will face more equal
opportunities.

Originally from the hill district,
Bell was an undergraduate at
Duquesne University. He then

A

went on to graduate in the top
portion of his class at Pitt Law
School in 1957.

He worked as a lawyer at the
Department of Justice under
President Dwight Eisenhower.
When the Department of Justice
asked him to sever ties with the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
he resigned.

Bell then went on to join the
six—lawyer office of the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, which was
then headed by Thurgood
Marshall in the early 1960s.

After teaching for a year at the
University of Southern California,
Bell was appointed to Harvard in
1969. Bell left his position as a
Harvard professor for a job as the
dean of Oregon University Law
School. In 1985, he resigned as
dean in protest over a faculty
decision to not hire an Asian-
American woman for a faculty
position.

Bell is currently still on his
leave of absence from Harvard
University over the faculty
decision to not hire a minority
female as a professor.

commitment to

contributions of different ethnic
groups, minority students will be
denied the same sort of self-
image that white students are
taught in a Eurocentric
curriculum, according to Ligons.

“If I try and view things from a
Eurocentric point of view it’s like
trying to put someone else’s shoe
on,” he said.

The observance of African-
American history began in 1926
when C. G. Woodson, Ph.D.
headed the organization of Negro
History Week. In 1976, President
Gerald Ford added three weeks

History Month. Pitt has sponsored
celebrations for Black History
Month for the past seven years.

This year, according to Ligons,
BAS and other African-American
organizations will provide
programs that are better than
have been offered in the past.

“We expect capacity crowds
for all of the events," Ligons said.

“We’ve never gotten more than
50 percent of the black population
at Pitt Ito attend], but this year we
hope that more students of all
races will show up for the
programs,” he said.

“February is so exciting," said
Rob Penny of the black studies
department. “One hundred
percent of African— Americans
get involved somehow. There is
so much going on in the
community that you have to be
involved in one way or another.

“African Liberation Month is
what I like to call it,” he said.
“February just highlights the
contributions of African-
Americans which are happening
all year long.”

Lectures, performances part of month's events

By Kin) Palmiero
Sta_[]" Writer

 

“Celebrate, My Children” will be the theme of
Black History Month at the University ofPittsburgh.

“It’s a celebration of the past, future and present
and being proud of our heritage and what we’ve
obtained despite oppression,” said Marta Efﬁnger,
deputy chairperson of the Black Action Society.

A lecture by jawanza Kunjufu, Ph.D., onjan. 31
will mark the first activity of Black History Month.
Kunjufu is the author of several books, and works
with young black people.

“He is an educator and does a good job of
targeting the problems of black youth,” said James
Raymond, advisor to BAS. “Developing a Positive
Self—lmage for African Americans” will be the topic
of Kunjufu’s lecture.

Kunjufu is the founder of African—American
Images, an organization that helps minority children
develop pride and self—awareness in their heritage.
This is Kunjufu’s second visit to Pitt.

A poetry reading by nationally known poet Sonia
Sanchez is scheduled for Feb. 8. Sanchez is an
international lecturer on black culture and literature.
Local poet, playwright and performer Valerie J.
\X/illiams—Lawrence will also read at this event.

A co-founder and former member of the Black
Panthers, Bobby Seale, will be speaking on “New
Perspectives on Black Liberation” on Feb. 14.
According to Raymond, the Black Panthers “came
along when there was very little empowerment in
the black community and urged people to take
responsibility.” Seale is involved in efforts to teach
the importance ofhanding down leadership for the
liberation of African—Americans to younger
generations.

Another speaker, Ron Daniels, is involved in a
commission to get Malcolm X’s birthday declared
a national holiday. He will be speaking on Feb. 17
about his experiences with the commission in the
past two years. '

The Kuntu Repertory Theater, operated through
the black studies department, will present “Crawford
Girl Presents Billy Holiday” on Feb. 7 and 8. The
show, which was written by Vernell Lillie, Ph.D.,
features Pitt students and faculty. Several local jazz
musicians will play at the show, according to
Effinger. A discount is available to BAS members.

“We purposely spread out programs throughout -
the month so everyone could come and we tried to
pick speakers who could give to the students as
well as to the community," said Effinger.

Marcus Guy, BAS chairperson for the Black
Active Students Inter—Collegiate Struggles expressed
disappointment that Black History Month was not
a greater part of the educational system.

“It’s really sad that we have only one month set
aside to study black history. It’s everyone’s history,”
Guy said.

Diverse population requires support systems

University~programmed supportsystems
must be designed to respond to the
individual needs of a diverse student
population. This requires effective
utilization of institutional resources and a
high level of commitment. There are
considerable factors impacting the
academic enterprise such as AIDS and
conﬁdentiality, increased access for the
handicapped, civil liberties and First
Amendment issues, the increasing cost of
financing higher education and
considerations of the university
infrastructure. The existence of diversity
remains the single most critical challenge
and presents myriad opportunities for
higher education to work diligently toward

Qelimination of artiﬁcial barriers which

continue to plague our pluralistic society.
To gain some perspective on the difficulty
of institutions to respond to ,a diverse
student population, Alvin Toffler (1989)
appears to have captured the essence of
our dilemma with the following statement:
“All education springs from some image of

, the future. If the image of the future held

by a society is grossly inaccurate, its
educational system will betray its youth,
and the inaccuracies will be made obvious
by who participates and when.”

The past 50 years in higher education
reﬂect tremendous growth opportunities
and innovations. Campuses across the
nation are intellectually richer and more
culturally diverse because of the increased
number of women, minorities and other
groups in active pursuit of higher
education. Hall (1966) observed that
Americans have “an acultural bias" (p.
173) because we seem to want to believe
that differences among the people of the
world are superﬁcial. While this is a
desirable and obtainable goal, its practice
has not attained wide acceptance on our
college and university campuses today.

g Once students have met university

admissions requirements and matriculate,
they expect to find an environment of
support and acceptance. Instead, for many
students, they often encounter various
forms of resistance which threaten their
self—esteem and commitment to the
institution. For those students who may
find themselves in the minority, the major
issue thus becomes the creation of a

Harmon

"If the university fails to
recognize this potential
for the creation of a
more enlightened
society, the loss in
human understanding
far exceeds the benefit
and value of post-
secondary education... "

hospitable and supportive environment
in which to pursue education — an
environment in which their uniqueness
will be afforded the same level of respect
and acceptance as that of the majority.
In assessing the university environment
and its _ability to embrace a diverse
population, one assumes that the institution
itself must change and indeed seeks to do
so in order to function as a microcosm and
model for realignment along lines of

_ cultural, ethnic, racial, social and gender

sensitivity. When students perceive that
the institution is unable to demonstrate
this realignment, they begin to form sub-
communities designed to overcome
inadequacies of the campus environment.
Consequently their loyalties become
group-oriented rather than institutional.
The presence of significant numbers of
students in sub-communities allows the
diversity within to become apparent and
the uniqueness of individual members to
be recognized. Members of a sub-
community may feel more secure
acknowledging their differences when
they are members of a stratified group.
Parenthetically, we must be cognizant of
the fact that there may be a point at which
sub-communities can create barriers
between themselves and the rest of the
institution, which inhibit understanding,
cooperation, sharing and learning. Racial
and ethnic division and acts of incivility
weaken the integrity of the institution and
limit its ability to function as a vital
community.

The nation’s colleges and Universities
are on the brink of resolving critical
concerns caused by the‘ demands of a
diverse student population. Gaining
resolution has been difficult atbest because
of a structure historically characterized as
a traditional and conservative enterprise.
Higher education has one of the most
urgent obligations and an unequivocal
commitment to affirming diversity as a
model of society. In affirming and
embracing diversity, the university must
strive to accommodate the needs of
individual students in an environment of
learning. The structuring of formalized
programs as integral components of the
academic curriculum thus allows students
to gain an appreciation of diversity which
effectuates a greater under-standing of
their membership and role in a pluralistic
society. The following recommendations
are not inclusive but may serve as a model
for the continued development of
institutional initiative. Accordingly:

1. The university should continue the
development of programs that afﬁrm the
dignity of all individuals where equal
access to educational opportunity is
vigorously pursued.

2. The university should stress the
development of a community-oriented
environment that purposefully promotes
and encourages the student’s intellectual
interest.

3. The university, consistent with its
mission, should ensure representation
reﬂective of the composition of its student

population in all facets of university life.
4. The university should develop an
“ethic of care” that allows the student to

_ gain an understanding of the nature and

the need for adjusting to the academic
environment and the behavior necessary
for a positive university experience.

5. The purpose of the university is
learning. In this regard, instruction,
academic—suppoit services and experiences
must facilitate the transition, intellectual,
emotional and personal growth and
development of students. Through
orientation, advising and instniction, the

goal is to foster the student's development «

of self-awareness and an appreciation of
individual differences. Inherent differences
reflected in a diverse student population
should contribute in a positive way to the
university experience within the academy.
If the university fails to recognize this
potential for the creation of a more
enlightened society, the loss in human
understanding far exceeds the benefit and
value of post—secondary, education. As
stated by Dr. Bartlett Giamatti, former
president of Yale University, in “Colleges
and Universities Have Failed to Assert
Their Ideals and Purposes Persuasively,”
(Chronicle of Higher Education, Nov. 9,
1988, pp. B1, 2):

“Of all the threats to the institution, the
most dangerous comes from within. Not
the least among them is the smugness that
believes the institution’s value is so self-
evident that it no longer needs explication,
its mission so manifestthat it no longer
requires definition and articulation.

“Silence does not assert that institutional
behavior — how the university or college
treats the people within it, invests its
money, admits students, promotes faculty,
comports itself vis-a—vis other social
institutions — is every day, in a thousand
different forms, how the college or
university teaches. The place teaches by
example. In this fashion it is a model for
ethical or moral behavior or it is not, but
however it acts, people —— within and
without — draw lessons.”

examples above are why

students, we must remember that

same time this should not lead us
to believe that there is no other
work to be done. Our history is
our foundation. We must build
on the legacy. The most important
point to be made this year
concerning Black History Month
is this: Strengthening our

However, as we move into the
year 2000, many of our African-
American youth know nothing
about celebrating their past or
their present, nor have any reason
to celebrate a future.

BAS believes that the images
young African-Americans see of
themselves are crucial to how

to rob, rape and murder? How
can he possibly have any time to
plan out the streets of the nation’s
capital like Benjamin Banneker,
develop the traffic signal like
Garret A. Morgan, or publish and
edit his own business magazine
like Earl Graves? Consequently,
how can an African American

woman do anything productive
when the media parades her only
in the welfare lines or on the
street corners? How can she
possibly have the intellect to be
the first African-American woman
president of a bank, like Lena
Walker, the first African—American
president of a black college, like

spiritually.

One might ask, as an African-
American college student, “What
can I give?" When we have passed
this decade, will the young people
of tomorrow still be remembering
only Dr. Martin L. King, or will we
be adding to the list of
accomplishments that our

community helps us strengthen
ourselves. This in itself provides
leadership for the generations of
African—American youth.

B.A.S.I.C.S. to create college network  

By Christopher McCall
Sta_ﬂ'lVriter

In an effort to coordinate the struggle of
African-American students, the Black Action
Society will establish a network during
Black History Month to communicate with
black student organizations on campuses
across the nation.

“We are going to organize a way to

L distribute information between black

student organizations in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
and across the nation,” said Marcus Guy,
chairperson of the new Black Active
Students’ Inter—Collegiate Struggle.

“We will act as a network for support
programs to help black students survive,”
he said.

‘It's a common struggle for black retention,
financial aid, and to improve the social,
cultural and educational needs of blacks
everywhere,‘ said Guy.

Guysaid thatthe retention rate for minority
students is poor; only 15 percent earn an
undergraduate degree in five years.

Financial aid is another issue facing
African-American students that will be

’ discussedinthe new B.A.S.I.C.S. workshops.

African-American aid has almost
disappeared in the last 10 years, Guy said.

Since B.A.S.I.C.S. is in its infant stages,
the first two workshops, on Feb. 9 and 10,
will contain representatives from black
student organizations only around
Pittsburgh, Guy said.

“In these sessions we will separate
ourselves into committees that represent
different campuses and discuss
improvements that need to be done; then
we will draft a city—wide constitution to
outline the primary objectives of
BA.S.I.C.S.,” he said.

The first workshop will begin at 9 a.m. in
the Cathedral of Learning, and the second
will be held the next day in the Kurtzman
Room in the William Pitt Union, also at 9
a.m.

“First we have to come together,” Guy
said. “Then, once we have established the
leadership, we will try and put together
programs to develop solutions for the
problems that black students face.”

After these organizational meetings, a
large B.A.S.I.C.S. workshop will be held on

Feb. 16 at 11 a.m. in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom. Black student organizations from
across the nation are invited to this
workshop.

“This is the project that we are preparing
for currently,” said David Covington, a
BA.S.I.C.S. committee member.

“It will be a good opportunity for black
student activists to get together and talk
about struggles on other campuses. We will
have speakers and other activities. The
focus will be on the past, present and future
of our race," Covington said.

Representatives from black student
organizations in universities are expected
to attend.

“We're working on contacts across the
nation,” said B.A.S.I.C.S. committee member
Nigel Gardener. ‘

B.A.S.I.C.S. benefits not only African-
American students, said network
coordinator Keith Davis. Davis said the

B.A.S.I.C.S. workshops are for everybody, '

and all students and faculty are invited to
attend..

“It’s for the university as a whole,” said
Davis. “We want everyone to attend.”

THE PITT NEWS. Black History Month Preview, Wednesday, January 39, 1991 J -I
 

Lack of funds keeps ,Blacklz'ne from reaching potential

By Tammy R. Poole
Staff Writer

Lisa James, editor of the
Blackline Networle/Journal at the
University of Pittsburgh, said the
monthly publication has a lot of
potential. In future issues she
would like to see more pages,
more information and more
worldwide issues covered — “a
USA Today black style".

“But all of that takes, of course,
more money, more money, more
money," said James, who began
her editorial position at the
newspaper last term. “It’s really
disheartening when you have the
people, and you have the
information, and you have the
talent, but you don’t have the
money to do what you want to
do."

Production costs for Blackline
are allocated from the University's
Student Government Board.
Although James feels that more
funds would allow Blackline to
show its full potential as a student
newspaper, she has been quite
satisfied with past issues
published this year.

“If I had my way, [Blackline]
would come out every day like
The Pitt News,” said James, a
junior majoring in clinical
psychology. “But as you know,
that would take a lot of money
and a lot of time. I think that with
what I'm working with now -
the staff thatl have — along with
people who pop in to give

information, I'm very impressed
with what we’ve done this year.
But I’ve always said that the
Blackline is a paper of potential.
It can always become more.than
what it is right now.”

The four—page paper, which
was created by the Black Action
Society in 1969, took the form of
a journal before it adopted its
present newspaper style. It
included the poetry, ideas,
opinions and talents of students
at the university who shared
common viewpoints and
perspectives. Since the staff
consisted of students whose time
contributed to the newspaperwas
limited due to classes, the papers
were not published as regularly
as they are now.

“What we're really looking
forward to is increasing the size
for next year, getting more

being able to print it out more

often. The first and foremost
priority is to make sure that all
BAS events are covered,” said
James.

James cited the need forAfrican-
American students to have a
newspaper they can relate to and
rely on for information.

“Anywhere you go in any
newspaper, you see articles that
are insensitive or incorrect in
their context where people can
so easily take it out of context. I
think that a lot of things that go
on, let’s say, on a campus, unless
you make the opportunity to get
your voice heard, no one really is
going to be nudging you along,
saying, ‘Go ahead. Make a little
ruckus and tell people how you
feel,”’ said James. “It’s all about
perspective, no matter what side
of the line that you’re standing
on. All newspapers have their
stab at insensitivity, and I guess
that’s just a part of writing  no
one knows everything to make

everybody happy. That would be
virtually impossible to do
anyhow.”

Since “no one knows everything
to make everybody happy,"James
said the BAS sees it as its
responsibility to maintain the
perspective of the African-
American students on campus.

“The title Blackline is saying
that without a shadow of a doubt,
you know whose perspective is
in [Blaclel1'nel,” said James. “It is
the viewpoint of what is important
to us without necessarily going in
elsewhere and expecting
someone else to do it.”

Before becoming editor of
Blackline, James was a staff writer
in her sophomore year, and she
said that she couldn't remember

P—7

when any students who weren't
black had tried to join the
Blackline staff.

“The entire staff is Afro-
American, but I think the Black
Action Society, for some reason,
when it says ‘black,’ people just
think that, ‘Oh, well, it’s for them
only.’ But if you can handle the
perspective, and if you think you
have a unique view, and you’re
open-minded, like I said, the door
is open. I don’t recall the BAS
ever slamming the door in
anyone’s face who ever tried to
participate on a committee or
anything," said James.

‘To a lot of people, it’s just a
piece of paper,” she said. “But
when you look at it, it’s a lot
more."

lligons says black Americans need tobe radical

By Tammy R. Poole
saw Writer

Ever since he was a freshman,
Douglas Ligons was “raising
noise" on the University of
Pittsburgh campus about the
concerns and issues facing
African—American students. He
said he would never classify
himself a militant, but rather as a
radical.

“I deﬁnitely consider myself a
radical,” said the senior majoring
in black studies and economics.
“I think that it is impossible to be
black in America and not bethat
way. Black people in America
should be born with the need to
be radical.”

In his first year, Ligons did not
bring his influe nce and motivation
to the Black Action Society.
Instead, he criticized the
effectiveness of the organization
and chose not to participate in
the group.

“In my freshman year and the
beginning of my sophomore year,
I wasn’t active in BAS because, in
my opinion, the organization was
noteffective. I was fighting issues,
but I wasn’t doing it within the
organization. I was just very
critical of what they were doing
until a friend asked me, what

right did I have for observation
without participation. If I wanted
to see a change, then I had to get
involved,” said Ligons.

Later in his sophomore year,
Ligons became a BAS committee
member. In his junior year, a
vacancy opened the post of
deputy chairperson, and he was
nominated to fill that position. As
a senior, Ligons currently is
chairperson of the BAS, and his
leadership skills are a necessity
for the type of responsibilities
that accompany his position.

“I basically serve as the main
spokesperson for the BAS while
responsible also for administrative
decisions, chairing the committee
administrative meeting,
responsible for decisions to
deputy chair, steering-committee
members and making emergency
decisions,” said Ligons.

In March elections will be held
to choose Ligons’ successor, but
he said his responsibility to keep
the voice of African-Americans
alive will go far beyond the BAS.

“I would just like to be
remembered as a team player. I
would like to be remembered
that I was there and was a part of
an 11-part system to ‘help all
black students here at Pitt,” Ligons
said.

Blacks say
military is
only option

By Renee Crespy
Sta_[)" Writer

Many African-Americans
on campus feel that there
are disproportionately high
numbers of African-
Americans in the U.S. military
and serving in the Persian
Gulf.

Alicia Smith, programming
chairperson for the Black
Action Society, said she felt
that many African-Americans
are in the gulf because the
service was a last resort for
them.

“I do think that there is an
alarmingly high number of
African-Americans over
there, and yes, they
volunteered, but look at the
situations that made them
volunteer," Smith said.

"We just don’t have a lot
of options opened to us,”
Smith said.

John Stecklow, comm-
ander of Air Force ROTC at
Pitt, said that he didn't have
access to statistics showing
the number of African-
Americans in the service,
but that African-Americans
make up approximately 6
percent of the Air Force
ROTC program at Pitt.

“We emulate the system
norm, and " there is
approximately 6 percent of
African-Americans in the Air
Force ROTC on the Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon campuses, ”
said Stecklow.

Pitt student Shaon Bery
said she feels that society
provides minorities and
those of lower economic
status with very few options

' for the future.

“I agree that society has
set it up so that the lower
economic society has [few]
choices. And society has set
it up so that black people
only have a few choices,”
said Bery.

“The only chance that
black people have is playing
either basketball [or] football,
or going to the service,” Bery
said.

Rhonda Watson, a student
at Pitt, agrees with Bery.
Watson said that many
blacks are bribed with
athletic scholarships, but that

BAS rem-U95 pageant  for BHM begins early
By Megan Be;-(mo Sta__0' W1-lter

The Mr. and Miss Black Action Society pageant is being
revived after a two—year hiatus.

According to pageant chairperson Khafre Abif, the pageant is
being revived because BAS feels it needs representatives to act
as social rather than political liaisons.

“We’re hopingto crown the best representatives of conscience,
education and talent as our African legacy,” Abif said,

The contestants will be judged on their poise, articulation,
talent, overall appearance and a three—minute statement on
their 1’ O16 in helping to progress the African-American community
in today’s society.

Mr. and Miss BAS will be crowned in the traditional headdress
of an African warrior and an African queen.

Once crowned, Mr. and Miss BAS will take on several duties,
including participating in BAS service projects and parades.
'fIl11;ey will also be the BAS homecoming representatives in the

Abif said the winners will hold “special significance” to BAS
and other black student groups on campus.

Pittprofbonoredfor wor/e in black literature

By Kim Palmiero
Suﬁ‘ Writer

English Professor Donald A.
Petesch was “amazed” that
throughout his undergraduate,
graduate and doctoral studies, he
was never introduced to books

‘ by black authors.

“I didn’t realize how restricted
the canon was at the time,” he
said.

It wasn’t until later in his

. teaching career that Petesch

began to explore black literature.
“I taught the firstblack literature

‘course at Pitt in 1970, and it

became very popular,” he said;
Now, 20 years later, Petesch’s
first book, A Spy in Enemy’s
Ten'itqry.- The Emergence of
Modern Black Literature, has
been named an Outstanding
Book on the subject of human
rights in the United States. This
honor was granted by the
Gustavus Myers Center, which
serves “to identify, reward and
publicize outstanding books
about all kinds of intolerance in
the United States.” The book
deals largely with black literature
from the 18508 to the 19203.
When notiﬁed that his book

had been chosen, Petesch said
he was very surprised.
“Actually, the current book
grew out of an introduction to
another book on black literature,
but I realized that one had to go
back to the beginnings in order
to study the subject,” he said. ,
“I’m trying to talk about the
presentation of the black self in
literature, ” said Petesch. He added
that this was a difficult task
because of the stereotypes which
existed in the post-Civil War
period. “Plantation literature and
graphic forms of representation
were prevalent during the post-

war period and contributed to
these stereotypes,” Petesch said.

Petesch spent many years doing
research for his first book. He
examined various mediums to
study society’s perception of
blacks, including lithographs, toys
and postcards. He found that
“black writers have always felt
conscious of whites in a way that
whites have not felt conscious of
blacks.”

Petesch said that this self-
consciousness is “is less overt
among many writers today then
some of the black writers of the
’60s.”

Petesch said that, in the past,
publishing houses were not very
open to black writers. Some black
writers were published in black
newspapers, but they tried to
present themselves as white
people in their writing “in order
to appeal to a white audience
and avoid black stereotypes," he
said.

Modern black literature has
changed immensely, according
to Petesch.

“The black writers are writing
for blacks now. Blacks are talking
about themselves with honesty
and beauty,” he said.

W'illis
Continued from page 4

UConn is tough even without

a true point man, and even though
Tate George wasn’t the
consummate lead guard, he had
a good court sense. The Huskies
also dearly miss the passing of
Nadav Henefeld, who made
Smith's job so much easier last

yean

It doesn’t seem as though help
is on the way, either, because
none of the heralded recruits is a
point guard. It wouldn't be out of
the question to see Scott Burrell
among the team leaders inassists
next year. It would be a sign of
problems, however.

Nova

Continued from page 4
In the first meeting this year
Woodard was five of nine from
long distance and finished with
17 points.

In that game he helped ‘Nova
erase a 17-point deficit by hitting
three three-pointers. During the
comeback the Wildcats outscored
Pitt 24-4 in a 6-1/2 minute stretch
that gave them a three—point lead.

Another guard Pitt has to watch
is Chris Walker, who takes most
of his shots from three-point land.
Against Pitt, seven of his eight
shots were bombs; he connected
on three and finished with 11
points. 4

“I think we’re going to have to
mix it up against them
defensively,” said Coach Paul

Evans. “I think we’ll play some
lman-to—man] to start, depending
on the foul situation. We’ll do
some matchup zone, and maybe
some triangle and two.”

Evans’ defensive substitution
will improve tonight if Bobby
Martin returns to the lineup. It
was against Villanova that he
reopened a cut on his finger that
has caused him to miss the lash‘
six games.

Evans is optimistic that trainer
Tony Salesi has developed a
rubber splint that will allowMaitin
to play. He has been practicing
with a metal splint that is illegal
for NCAA games.
