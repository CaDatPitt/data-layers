Pogo sticks come

outof the toy chest

The sport of pogo sticking goes extreme

Christen DiClaudio
For The Pitt News

Like most other days, Fred Grzybowski
was still tangled in his sheets, surrounded

. by the plain custard color walls of his Los

Angeles home at 3:30 p.m. on Aug. 22.
He had his laptop propped against his
knees, watching YouTube videos to pass
the time.

“Well, I guess I should go pogo,” he
casually suggested over aivideo chat.

He rolled out of bed, put on a pair of
black jeans and a brightblue T—shirt that
read “Pogo Dudes.”

Grzybowski is, according to many
members of the pogo stick community,
the best pogo stick rider in the world.

The hardcore background music

‘ pumped him up as he taped his wrists and
as an afterthought, substituted a shower

i with a few swipes of deodorant. Then

he was off to his backyard, pogo stick in
hand.

We all have that classic image of a pogo
stick: a steel frame with a thick spring
running down the middle. It’s the toy our
parents bounced around on and the one
that some kids still ﬁnd under their Christ-
mas trees, though it has since become
somewhat of a rarity. But it’s not the one __
Grzybowski, 20, and his fellow jumpers

mount every day. Instead, they bounce _

on a new and improved pogo stick called
a Flybar stick — a larger and hoppier.ver-
sion of the traditional pogo stick.

To call the Flybar stick a toy would be
misleading. Flybar, a, branch of SBI En-
terprises, designed a stick in 2004 that
was larger and could support weight more
appropriate to an adult. Veined with 12

. heavy—duty rubber bands, the Flybar is

better equipped for more intensive riding,
including ﬂips and jumps that have reached
as high as the world record 8’6”, set last

summer in Pittsburgh by 16_-year—old Dan . ,

Mahoney of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

LITTLE SHOP OF HAIRS  

By: Lewis Lehe

The Shop has been keeping South.Oakland clean—cut and trimmed since 1948‘. Owner Pete reflects on 62 years of history.

here is nothing made of
plastic in The Shop. As
you enter, on the right
there sit six steel chairs with
cream color leather seats waiting
under wall mirrors. On the left
are two barber chairs, a rusty fan,
a steel space heater and the tools
of the haircutting trade gleaming
gently on a low shelf. The only
sign of the world outside is a 9/11
memorial wall calendar taped to
a ﬁling cabinet. And to the world
outside, the only sign of The Shop
is a white piece of paper taped to
the window facing South Oak-
land’s Frazier Street.. The paper
says simply, “The Shop. ‘T-Sat.
9-1,” written in black felt pen.
The Shop’s resident barber
since 1948, Pete Maniglia, used
to advertise with a proper sign
that read “Pete’s Shop,” but quit
when rioters smashed it with a

£tPlvt¢II¢IIl14iétktlldttotovcrcnoa-Iiocccaqt

brick.The date and cause of the
riot escape the near 90-year-old’s
memory today.

“The Super Bowl?” someone
suggests.

“Nope. Before!” Pete says.

“Rodney King?”

“King! That was him! Martin
Luther King.”

Some businesses might ﬂoun-
der without advertising since the
death of Martin Luther Kingjr. in
1968. The Shop stays open, how-
ever, drawing many of the same
customers. They arrive with an
air of inevitability that has, over
time, transformed from Pete’s
Shop to The Shop — the only
barber shop that its customers
will consider patronizing.

Pete and a silver-haired man
— a patron of. 60 years —— dis-
cuss the G-20 protests, which are
just beginning, over the sound of

scissors swiping and the drone of
conservative talk radio. To Pete
and the customer, the Summit’s
most crucial issue is What to do
with the arrestees. They agree
on a policy they gleaned while
serving as Marines in the Pacific
theater: If a prisoner escapes, the
guard serves the sentenceuntil
the prisoner is recaptured".

This same conversation could
have transpired during the eras of
the Martin Luther King]r., Rod-
ney King and the Super Bowl riots.
For decades, The Shop’s regulars
have migrated dutifully, long af-
ter their own exodus transformed
the neighborhood outside.

The Shop caps a line of three
boarded~up storefronts at the
corner of Frazier and Ward
streets, three blocks south of
the Boulevard of the Allies. To-
day, the four blocks of Frazier

lltlfvtt-zl1'¢¢I¢¢l,O‘¢...g.,.,.....q,.,a,...,u;,g,.u,_e;,.y...,g,.-9a...,-

Street form a low—income, black
hamlet at the southernmost edge
of South-Oakland. Here, men re—
cline on porches, children play
tag in the streets andvteenagers
shoot hoops in Dan Marino Park.
It is a pleasant street, but some
houses are abandoned or show
signs of peelingpaint and droop-

ing porches.

Gangs sometimes operate in
the area. But aside from the bro-
ken window, Pete hasn’t experi-

_enced any problems with crime.

“No trouble from Black or
White,” he said. Nothing since

1959, when a man robbed him

on Dawson Street.

Pete took overwhat was soon
to be “Pete’s Shop” from another
barber, who had already been cut-
ting hair in the single 20-by—2o—
foot room, Pete estimates, for 40
years. It was then just one piece

of a bustling business district
that included “five and dimes,
saloons, pharmacies [and] shoe
repair places.” Pete’s smile broad-
ens as he paints the scene: “It was
a beautiful neighborhood  We
used to have three barber shops
down here at one time!”

The wellspring of South Oak-
land’s commerce was the Jones
and Laughlin Steel Mill, located
down the hill, on the bank of the
Monongahela. Jobs at the mill
made South Oakland a melting
pot of Jewish, Irish, Black, East-
ern European and Italian fami—
lies — without the tensions that
sometimes plagued diverse neigh-
borhoods. “They all seemed to
get along,” Pete says, smiling.

Joe Bellisario, another Oak-
land barber, arrived in the neigh-
borhood from Abruzzi, Italy in
1954. He agrees with Pete’s as-

sessment. During the summer,
he says, families left their doors
open at night to invite the cool
breeze — with no fear of invit-
ing thieves.

“It was a good country!” Joe
says, in a thick Italian accent.

Joe has owned a barbershop on
Atwood Street since the 1960s.
Joe and old acquaintances some-
times speak Italian there. ]oe’s
shop is both closer to campus and
to the present than Pete’s.

The inside hosts traces ofmo—
dernity: a television, stacks of
Newsweek and a clientele that
includes professionals from
nearby hospitals, as well as Pitt
students.

There is even a sign painted in
the window. It reads “Joe Bellisa-
rio’s Sanitary Barber Shop.”

By contrast, the encroaching
present —- embodied in the spec-
ter of endless student rental prop-
erties —— is still two blocks away
from Pete’s shop. But even when
the students arrive en masse, it
could be a while before anyone
notices Pete’s sign, barely visible,
like the corner of a time capsule
protruding from the ground.

Two demands that never
whither with age, though, are the
need to remember happy times
and the need to get a haircut.
The Shop sells both. Eight dol-
lars, please.

Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

SARAJEVO, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
--When Bosnians tell stories, they divide
time into before and after the war.

They talk about a time when people en-
joyed universal health care in Yugoslavia
— before the term became popular — and
when Muslims, Catholics and Serbian Or-
thodox people lived together in peace.

Years from now, however, people might
discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina with re-
spect to the country’s accession into the
European Union. I

Even before Bosnia and Herzegovina
formally began the European Union pre-
accession process in 2008, the country
tried to implement programs to increase
its EU appeal. ‘

Bosnia adopted the Bologna Process
—— the education standard used in 46 coun-

tries, including the member states of the

EU — in 2003, and universities are adapt-
ing at various rates.

Bosnian students are pushed to decide
their futures at an earlier age than students

the city’s drinking water.

in the United States. At about the age of 15,.

Bosnian students can apply for high schools
in speciﬁc ﬁelds, like medicine, economics
and engineering, with the option of attend-
ing a general high school.

Pitt students in the School of Arts and
Sciences generally declare their majors by
the end of their sophomore year.

“Here (in Bosnia), you are not always
sure that you’re going to go to college. So
you need some high school that will en-
able you to work later if you’re not lucky
enough to go to college,” said Nejra Kadié,
a 23-year-old philosophy student at the
University of Sarajevo. Kadié graduated
from a medical high school in 2005 and
could work as a nurse.

A student who pursues a bachelor’s de- _
' gree must pass his “dip1omski rad,” which is

a large research project that’s comparable

' to a master’s thesis in the United States.

The Bologna Process creates a quality
standard for students at the bachelor’s,
master’s and doctoral levels so students can
move between colleges more easily.

Students can earn a bachelor’s degree in
three or four years in the Bologna Process.

Tuition tax officially
off the table for city

Mayor hopesto solve city budget hole by creating coalition.

john Manganaro
For The Pitt News

'' After weeks of protest from‘ students and

university ofﬁcials, Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl canceled his bid for the controversial
Fair Share Tax, and will instead create a
“New Pittsburgh Coalition” to solve the
city’s pension problems. _

Ravenstahl -agreed to take the tax off
the table after Pitt, Carnegie Mellon and
the nonproﬁt division of Highmark agreed
to increase their annual donations to the
city. City Council members and university
spokespeople declined to reveal exactly
how much the donations increased.

Pitt’s Vice Chancellor of Public Affairs
Robert Hill said in an e-mail, “Tuition will
not be targeted to support the University’s
move to help the city solve its ﬁnancial
challenge.” , -

. Ravenstahl, ﬂanked by local univer-

' sity and nonproﬁt leaders, including Pitt
’ Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, outlined a

few aspects of the decision during a press

conference held in the City— County Build-

ing, Downtown, Dec. 21. T
Ravenstahl saidihe and the City Council

decided to table the Fair Share Tax and to

_ instead work to instate a “new Pittsburgh

collaborative formed to address the budget
woes of the city.” g _

“Thisis a leap of faith for all of us,”
Ravenstahl said of his decision to scrap
the tax, which was projected to close a $15
million—per—year hole in the city’s budget.
“The future of our city and our citizens is
riding on it.” .

“With only a week, left in the year, we
have no further intention of pursuingthis
tax,” Ravenstahl told iKDK,A:reporterfs dur-
ing an interview following the press: con-
ference. “We’ve made a commitment to
[Chancellor Nordenberg] and university
presidents. At this point’, tabling the tax
will take it out of the discussion.”

“Students played an enormous role in
ﬁghting this tax,” Hillsaid.» “The student
activism in this anti-tax campaign is yet
another example of the way students have
helped the city’s progress.”

Reinventing a classic hop

Pogo stick trends make. national headlines, television talk shows while being consideredfor an oﬁicial sport status

athletes, pogo stick riding has
overcome its image as a low im-
pact pastime for children and has
been resurrected as an extreme
sport. And it’s receiving a lot of
attention.

Jay Leno and Ellen Degeneres
have,both interviewed Grzybows-
ki on their respective television
shows. Pogo excitement landed
on the front page of the Wall
Street Journal in August. There
have been highlight clips on

MTV and debates on ESPN over

whether to consider jumping an
ofﬁcial sport. Even acrobatic per-
formance group Cirque du Soleil
has shown interest in the art of
jumping. _

Last summer, Pittsburgh
hosted the sixth annual Pogopa-
looza, the only annual national
pogo stick competition. It was
organized and hosted by CMU
junior Nick Ryan, who said the

first ﬁve Pogopaloozas were very
unorganized. One was held “in
a parking lot of some ice cream
shop on a highway, in the woods
with, like, six people from around
that area.”

Bridge. The main event took place
in Schenley Plaza and hosted 60
participants, ranging in age from
13 to 24. People from 23 states,
Canada and England hopped.

Sarajevo students
discuss education

Students can earn degrees in three years instead of four

her third year of sttidying psychology at
the University of Sarajevo, is wary about
students earning degrees in three years
instead of four. ~

“I think it was much more useful before
because after four years,’ you really got
knowledge. Before, psychologists could
work in schools ,h,ereand there with four
years [oiruniversity study]. But now with
three years, with your diploma you have
nothing actually.”

Estelle Tran I ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR

The “Stari Most” bridge in Mostar, Herzegovina was ﬁrst built by the Ottomans but

destroyed by the Croatian army in 1993.

Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Bologna Pro-
cess report for 2008-09 said that there
were about 100,000 students below the
doctoral level enrolled and about 70 per-
cent of them plan to attain master’s de-
grees. T

Bosnia,,,and-Herzegovina have eight
public universities. The University of Sa-
rajevo offers 24 institutions, and students
generally don’t take courses in other in-
stitutions.

‘ Pogo Squad’ performed in parades

CM U student Nick Ryan discusses the beginning of his pogo stick hobby — and the debilitating injury it caused

Pogo 4 15

Per Minute,” where participants
bounced up to four times per sec-
ond and the “Highjump,” where
riders jumped over a bar that was
raised higherand higher as they
cleared each height.

Even though press and word
of mouth are persuading many
teenagers across the U.S. and be-
yond to start jumping, the sport
still has a long way to go.

“I think there aremore people
jumping out of airplanes,” Flybar
sales chairman Paul Treacy said
jokingly. He acknowledged that
many sports in the same realm,
like snowboarding and skate-
boarding, took almost a decade
to be recognized as legitimate.

No different from other ath-
letes in the genre, participants
amaze onlookers as they shrug
off injuries such as brush burns,
chipped pelvises and broken
teeth and cheek bones. They just

hop back onto their sticks and try
to land their next trick.

“To date we have very few in-
juries that have been reported,”
Treacy said.

With that in mind, ﬂash back
to Carnegie Mellon’s Nick Ryan, A
who is a rare exception to the
safety record of pogo sticking
so far.

Ryan’s story begins in 2002 on
the streets of York, Pa.,.where his
disappointment in a silly Christ-
mas gift quickly morphed into a
diehard enthusiasm for every- .
thing pogo. He shared his love
with some friends, and before
they knew it, the “Pogo Squad”
was performing in local parades
and coining new stunts. Not sur-
prisingly, they had little compe-
tition, and Ryan became one of
the founders of jumping as it is
known today.

Website: Pitt not up topar on Tweets

George Washington University named “most proliﬁc Twitterer” for its use of 17 accounts and 57.7 average Tweets per day

Twitter 4 2

ing that U.S. universities have been quick
to adopt Twitter — a social networking
site that is less than 4 years old.

Universities use Twitter as a broadcast-
ing channel, rather than “a medium for
conversations,” according to the study,
and schools use the site less frequently
than average Twitter users.

The study listed Pitt as second—lowest
in terms of followers (112 at the time of the
study) and third-lowest in both number of
users following (28) and average Tweets
per day (3.1).

Additionally, it reported that Pitt
ranked third-lowest in number of Uni-
versity—affiliated accounts with two, tying

with Brown, Clark, the Stevens Institute
of Technology and the Colorado School
of Mines.

Fedele said he’s not aware of any
University—affiliated account other than
PittTweet, and UniversitiesAndColleges.
org could not be reached for comment.

The problem with the research ﬁnd-

ings, Fedele said, is a matter of timing.

“We were only up for a couple of days
when they conducted the poll,” he said,
adding that the first PittTweet was re-
corded on Aug. 25. Data collection for the
study began just days later, on Sept. 1.

Fedele said that for Pitt, Twitter is like
any new communications tool, and so it’s
still in its exploration phase.

“We’re testing it out. We’re seeing how
effective it is,” he said. “If it looks like it’s
going to solve some of our communication
problems, it will be with us to stay.”

But even four months since its cre-

ation, the Twitter account still sees low

activity.

As of press time, the site recorded a
total of 15 posts, and it had 323 followers.
That’s about one-sixtieth of the number
of subscribers to the Twitter accounts of
the most—followed school, Harvard Uni-
versity.

Topping the list for the university with
the most official Twitter accounts was
the University of Florida, which recorded
24.

In addition to the main research news
outlet, UFNow, and the official campus
newsletter, InsideUF, other university
affiliates —- including the journalism
school, the engineering school, the phar-
macy school and even the library —— are
on Twitter.

“We knew some offices were doing it,
but we didn’t realize how extensive it was,”
university spokesman Steve Orlando said,
adding that there was no concerted effort
among administrators to begin Twitter
accounts.

He said UFNow was originally intended
to only reach reporters, but it now at-
tracts students, other universities, local
elementary schools and funding agen-
cies. The account broke 1,000 followers
last week.

Orlando attributed the number of ac-
counts to the value of social media, adding
that Twitter and the university’s Facebook
page allow administrators to connect di-

‘ rectly with the community.

“It’s no secret that the news business
 is going through a real hard time right
now,” he said. “There are fewer outlets,
there are fewer reporters and our job in
the news office is to get news out.”

George Washington University was
named the most prolific Twitterer, av-
eraging 57.7 Tweets per day on its 17 ac-
counts.

In addition to posting university-wide
news, GW administrators use Twitter for
social communications, such as congratu-

‘Where I belong’

Students discuss aspirations, dreams in country of Bosnia

Bosnia 4 16

Nejra Kadié is a ﬁrst-year student in the

school of philosophy and minors in Rus- ,

sian. She originally enrolled in the political
science school and worked on the campaign
for Haris Silajdzic’, a member of the Presi-
dency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kadié
grew weary of politics in her second year
of school and decided to change programs,
a move that forced her to start again as a
freshman.

She wanted to study English, but she
said English programs tend to ﬁll with
people who have straight A’s or the right
connections.

She aspires to become a police ofﬁcer
at an administrative level and plans to at-

_ tend the police academy after she ﬁnishes

herrdegrees in philosophy and political
science. ‘

Some aspects of the old system are more
diﬂicult to eliminate because they’re part
of the culture. ~

Dzumhur said that most students don’t
communicate with their professors because
they are authority ﬁgures. In fact, only re-
cently did the universities start employing
teaching assistants.

She also noted how the Bosnian schools
require students to memorize what she
called trivial details.

“In Europe, especially in America, that
is what I’ve heard,” she said, “You are learn-
ing the stuff you’ll need in your life and your
vocation. But here you learn everything,
even stuff you’ll never need in practice.”

Dzumhur used an example from pri-
mary school.

“I’ve heard that people have no clue
about Bosnia, like they still think that We
are still part of Yugoslavia or that there’s
still a war going on. That could never hap-
pen to our people because we know how
many sheep you have in Canada.”

Kadié recognizes that Bosnia and Her-
zegovina have a long way before they’ll
be considered part of Europe, but at least

with Bosnia’s use of the Bologna Process,
she can see improvements already.
“It’s not easy in America or anywhere.

But you get used to it.’? Kadié said. “I was ‘

born here. I live here. I would never leave.
I don’t‘ know how to live somewhere else.
This is where I belong.”

More H1N1 vaccines

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Pitt will offer H1N1 vaccines to students
and faculty members this month.
Students can receive the vaccine in the

William Pitt Union between 3:30 and 6‘

p.m. today. Faculty and staff can receive
the vaccine in the University Club between
1 and 5 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 14, according

to Pitt:’s website. . -

Pitt will offer both the injectable and
nasal-spray forms of the vaccine. The
University suggests on its website that
people who are pregnant, have a chronic
medical condition, such as asthma or heart
disease, or are immunocompromised take
the injectable form of the vaccine instead
of the nasal spray.

To register for the vaccine visit my.pitt.

Expert: Twitter will ‘slowly gaina foothold’ at universities, despite lack of experience among higher-led employees

student feedback on course recommen-
dations and networking students with
alumni in their respective fields.
Menachem Wecker, electronic com-
munications writer and manager of the
university’s main account GWToday, said
the decision to move to Twitter—based uni—

. versity broadcasts was an easy one since

many students already had accounts.

As a social media expert and co-found-
er of the Association for Social Media &
Higher Education, he predicts that Twit-
ter Will slowly gain a foothold among U.S.
universities.

“As higher education folks get more
used to Twitter, I think we will see more
and more people doing things of this sort,

because they make sense,” he said in an
e—mail. “It’s just tough, I think, because
most positions don’t have social media
written into their job descriptions.”

prise to Amanda Leff Ritchie, who man-
ages PittTweet.

understand that,” she said.

While the Twitter account is still gain-
ing speed, Ritchie said she sees more com-
munity interaction through Pitt’s official
Facebook page, which she also manages.

She said that while Pitt averages at least
10 responses per post on Facebook, she
could “count on one hand” the number of
responses the Twitter account receives.

“[With Twitter], I feel like I’m talking
to a vacuum, but when I’m communicating
Via Facebook, I feel like there’s really a
conversation going on,” Ritchie said.

She recently led ‘a University work-
shop to promote social networking among
Pitt administrators, adding that while
PittTweet is the only Pitt Twitter account
that she knows, some Pitt departments
already have their own Facebook pages.

But with any social media outlet,
Ritchie said, Twitter’s effectiveness at
Pitt could change.

“Who knows — maybe by this time
next year, my opinion will have completely
changed,” she said. “But I think right now,
Facebook really fits the bill for us to reach
out to our students.”

  ‘The weirdestthin;

Pogo stick jumper baffles doctors with symptoms of serious nervous system injury that bruised cervical vertebrae

Pogo 4 17

action—packed day for the Pogo Squad
until Ryan got home. He felt severe neck
pain, but wrote it off as a minor annoyance
rather than a serious injury. Suddenly, de-
bilitating pain cut through his right arm.
It passed after several minutes, and he
decided to take it easy. He caved.into the
couch and reached for the remote control
to watch TV.

“The weirdest thing happened, it was
like my hand reacted too slowly,” Ryan
recalled. “-You know, you tell your body to
do things and it’s instantaneous, you don’t
even think about it, so with this I was like,
‘What the hell is happening?”

Ryan refused to go to the emergency
room, so his mother took him to his gen-
eral practitioner. When he was called in to
see the doctor, he wiped out right on the
waiting room floor. He was not scared;
he was annoyed. The entire right side of
his body felt heavy and exhausted and he
was unable to move it.

The doctor was baffled and promptly
loaded Ryan into an ambulance and sent
him to the ER. The doctors ran numerous
tests to determine his condition and kept
him there for the next four days, he said.
He was miserable. He was not allowed to
eat or drink and went through countless
CAT scans and MRIs. He wore a neck brace
and had blood work. He felt unhappy not
knowingthe reason why his body was
behaving this way.

On day four, Ryan’s health was declared
stable — “as in I wasn’t going to die” —
and he was given the green light to eat.
His nurse delivered him a slice of pizza
and a glass of water. He was thrilled to

ﬁnally have nourishment, but when he ’

touched the pizza with his left hand, it was
way too hot. No problem, he thought, he
would just take a nap and try again when
it had cooled off. He woke up after about

three hours to find that his pizza was still
burning hot. '

Ryan experimented by dipping a few
ﬁngers into the glass of water. It felt like
it was boiling. When the nurses found out

they sent him for more tests.

The scans ﬁnally showed a small bruise
that had formed on vertebrae C2 through
C4 of his spine, near the base of the skull,
where the nerve endings controlling mo-

tor functions and sensation are found.
The bruising closed off his ability to feel
pain and temperature on the left side of
his body or to feel anything at all on his
right side.

‘It’s still incredibly underground’

Nick Ryan continuesto work in the pogo stick industry despite injuries that affected his body’s sense of movement ’

Pogo 4 21

Ryan was then sent to Magee Rehabili-
tation Center, a hospital in Philadelphia
for the paralyzed. He spent about a month
there, surrounded by people who had vary-
ing degrees of paralysis. Spending weeks
in the hospital was certainly not enjoy-

able, but he stayed chipper, telling himself,
“Reality is reality, and you can choose to
be either happy or sad about it.”

After day eight of living in Magee, he
retreated to his single room and set his

mind on making his right side move. He-

pickedﬁup his hand and stared at his point— ,

er finger for at- least 20 minutes, trying
with all his might to make it move. I

~ “I was sweating, I felt like I was running
a marathon, but I wasn’t doing anything
except looking at my ﬁnger,” he said.

Ryan’s ﬁnger twitched slightly. It was
all he needed to build his hopes back up.
Although he was a medical wonder -
his case stumped numerous physicians in
medical conferences — he was certain he
could train his body to function normally

» again. And he could not wait to get back

on a pogo stick. A
Ryan envisioned himself where his
friend, Fred Grzybowski, is now: making

V a living out of jumping. After his injury,

though, Ryan declared — with input from
his family — that it was in his best inter-
est to keep his feet on the ground. He
dropped out of the pogo circuit and went
to college. '

But Ryan simply could not keep himself
away from his passion. He made a radical
comeback by joining on the business end
of pogo sticking, and he now plays a major
role in promoting the sport.

“It has grown so much since I was in
it, but it’s still incredibly underground,”
Ryan said. “I think that with the proper
presentation, this could literally become
an extreme sport in the X Games.”

As participants flip off their pogo
sticks, push the limits to jump the'high—
est or the farthest, and even bounce with
no hands or on one foot or a combination
of the two, picturing these boys, and some
girls, in the X Games is not hard to do.

Around 6 p.m., the sun began to set in
Los Angeles. Fred Grzybowski moseyed
back into his apartment and plopped back
onto his bed. He was calm and noncha-
lant.

And Nick Ryan remembers the days II

when relaxing and pogo sticking were

his way oflife. He shakes his head and p

grins.
“It was a ridiculous life,” he said with
a slight sigh.

Adjunct profs

.\~

ull-time professors are a
dying breed. In»1960, 75
percent of college instruc-

‘tors in the United States were

full-time tenured or tenure-track
professors, according to The New
York Times. Today, only 27 per-
cent are full-time professors.
Some might think that adjunct
professors aren’t bona ﬁde in-
structors and that the label
“adjunct” implies an instructor
with less credibility and aptitude.
Adjuncts are, after all, freelance
teachers who are teaching class-
es as a side job. But before one
writes off the increase as a sign of
decline in the quality of America’s
upper—level education, consider
the beneﬁts adjunct professors
provide. ~ '
Whether they’re practicing
journalists, engineers or law-
yers,’ adjuncts are all  practic-
ing. They’re all working in their
respective industries, meaning
they should be up to date on the
latest knowledge, techniques and
happenings. Contrast this with
the tenured professor who has
been so ensconced in academia
he’s perhaps lost touch with the
latest developments. Whereas the
full-time professor might have
more connections in academia,
the adjunct is more involved in
the industry. For students hoping
to network through instructors,
the adjuncts are current insiders.
Also, the adjunct professor has
less afﬁliation with the school,
in an ofﬁcial sense at least. He’s
less likely to get caught up in any
school or departmental politics.

And when it comes to structur— ’

gffer. sadvarntagesr

ing the syllabus, he has more
freedom than the tenured pro-
fessor — which in truth could
affect students both- positively
and negatively. »

At institutions noted for their
research —— for example, Pitt’s
famous for its medical research
— the full-time professors
double as researchers. While it
would be unfair to pigeonhole
the full-time professor as a de-
vout researcher apathetic toward

his teaching duties, the adjunct .

professor might be the expert
who’s teaching because he loves
his ﬁeld and wants to share his
knowledge with students. ,
Of course, the adjunct is often
transitory, teaching only a few
semesters before he returns full-
time to his ﬁeld. For students,
this means schools usually don’t

provide real ofﬁces, making of—.

ﬁce hours tough to schedule. And
seeking a letter of recommenda-
tion and keeping ties with a tem-
porary instructor can be more
difﬁcult. The adjunct who’s less
zealous about his teaching can

- also slack offwithout fear of los-

inghis job. He knows he’s leaving
after this year, right?

Ideally, adjuncts serve as effi-
cient teachers. They cost employ-
ers less than full-time professors
and can ﬁll in empty slots in the
teaching roster. The adjunct
system isn’t‘perfect, but it pro-
vides its own distinctive merits.
Seemingly all teachers will face
criticisms from students, but stu-
dents shouldn’t be predisposed
to see adjuncts as less than le-
gitimate instructors.

Wide eyes on new officials

Maintain, interest in local politics even without the tuition tax threat

Giles Howard
Columnist

  
 

Freshly back from break and
facing a new semester unmen—
aced by proposals for a tuition
tax, I understand how tempting
it must be to turn our collective

eyes away from local issues and '

once again focus our advocacy on
Africa’s ills, but to do so would be
shortsighted.

A lot has happened while
we’ve been away on break, and
it all justiﬁes a closer attention
to local issues on our part.—

For instance, the make-up -of

City Council has changed sig- ’

niﬁcantly andnow has a new
president. Elected as president
with five votes on Monday,
Darlene Harris represents the
North Side and was a supporter
of the.Fair Share Tax. Harris is
also notable as a product of the
city’s Democratic machine and
has been identiﬁed by Randall

Taylor, a former colleague on the

Pittsburgh Public School Board,
as an anti-intellectual with class
biases, according to'a 2003 Post-
Gazette article. . ~ '

She might have been a com-
promise candidate voted into
ofﬁce by Bill Peduto, but she
doesn’t promise to be a friend
to Pittsburgh’s students.

On a more positive note for
students, two of the tuition tax’s
proponents — Tonya Payne and
Jim Motznik — left Council and
were replaced by two younger

individuals who don’t yet exhibit ‘

the “get off my lawn” attitude that
both Payne and Motznik exuded
while on the Council.

The composition of City Coun-
cil is better for students today
even if its president might not
be. But a more interesting and
immediate development in local
politics that none of us should
ignore is the new relationship be-
tween Pitt and the mayor. As part
of the deal averting the tuition
tax, the University of Pittsburgh

joined with Carnegie Mellon and
Highmark in something called
the “New Pittsburgh Collabora-
tive.” ‘

As part of the New Pittsburgh
Collaborative," Pitt agreed to in-
crease its contribution to the city
but did not cite a specific ﬁgure
nor agree to a speciﬁc timeline.
The University also agreed to
help Ravenstahl lobby Harris-
burg for either state handouts or

_, new powers of taxation to help

solve the pension crisis.

Although I’m sure we’re all
pleased that the tuition tax was
averted, we should be cognizant
of the University’s new role in
the city as well as its new finan-
cial obligations to the mayor’s
ofﬁce. '

In assuming partial ﬁnancial
responsibility for the pension
mess, Pitt is ‘functioning less as
an institution of higher learning
and more as a business concerned
with its political position in the
city and we must remember that
any money Pitt gives to the city to

Looks like an auspicious new millennium

Napster, George W Bush and Will Smith ensure everlasting American superiority

Dave Beitzel
Columnist

 

It’s a new year and a new decade.
As I was cleaning outmy chest of
drawers from the old decade, I dis-

- v  ~~- covered a column.I.wrote,thi1t.n€Y€i‘.... .

got published. To commemorate
this refreshing event, I present to
you a column fromjan. 1, 2000:

Happy new decade! Today, it’s
a fresh world.

Welcome to the Willenium.
I can’t stop listening to that Will
Smith song, “Will 2K.” It is the an-
them of this generation. The album
has already sold '2 million copies,
so I think it’s safe to say Big Willie
has a long, illustrious rap career
ahead of him. .

He’s come a long way since be-
ing dethroned in Bel Air. It’s been
almost four years since the show
ended, but it still feels like yester-
day. Maybe he could have made it

‘ relevant for a few more seasons

if he had worn the popular, con-
temporary clothing of Tommy
Hilﬁger. ‘

Even without the “Prince,”
it’s the beginning of a new era in
American politics. This is President
Clinton’s last year in office. Good
riddance, I say. After nextjanuary,

wwe’l_1_never have to hear from the

Clinton familyﬁagain. Gore,'too’.‘ I  ‘

It’s hard to predict who will
take his place. What we need now
is change, not more of the same. At
leastﬂthat’s what all the candidates
are saying. i .

John McCain looks like a prom-
ising dark horse. He is a straight-
talking media darling. The press
will never write anything negative
about the  New York Times
columnist Gail Collins, a liberal,
called McCai_1_1_ “a very attractive
candidate” and “a bridge candi-
date, a symbol of the new way
America has begun to think about
the military.” .

McCain is somebody who
doesn’t pander to the base. He has

a noble story of his status as an im-
prisoned pilot during the Vietnam
War, but he doesn’t exploit it. Col-
lins even noted this, saying, “the
candidate himself seldom brings
it up.” I .

McCain should have a decent
showing in Iowa, handily win

electoral demographic.

Otherwise, the only viable
candidate is Gov. George W. Bush.
There are some other good con-
tenders, and the ﬁeld is wide open,
but if anyone is sure to lose it’s Alan
Keyes. Black presidential candi-
dates never have a shot.

 

Welcome to the Willenium. I can’t stop
listening to that Will Smith song, “Will

Newﬁampshire, and it should

be smooth sailing after that. He’ll ~

select an extraordinary vice presi-
dential nominee, someone who is
capable of running the country, not
just someone to appeal to some

In May, Bush told a Salon.com
interviewer, “I showed the people
of Texas I’m a uniter, not a divider. I
refuse to play the politics of putting
people into groups and pitting one
group against another.”

Say what you want about his in-
tellect, he looks like a man of ‘his
word. He’s somebody I could sit

down and enjoy a beer with. Or an '

O’Doul’s. ’ .- ,3,

It’s nice that he wants to bring a
new air of civility to government. If
nothing else, at least he won’t bring
disgrace and scandal to the ofﬁce

T» like his predecessor. Bush vowed

to bring “dignity” to any office he
is elected to.

At any rate, it’s majority rule,
and the people of this country will
decide the election. Just like Bush
said in the interview, he’ll “just let
the voters choose who they want
to lead.” Democracy is one thing
we can always count on in this
country. ' 7

No matter who wins, ’what’s
the worst anyone could do? It’s a
rooti'n’—tootin’ time inthe‘United
States. We’ve averted the apoca-
lyptic threat of Y2K,websites like
Pets.com have provided an inde-
structible new dot-com economy
and the world is at peace.

To judge   ‘Decade from Hell , ’ Wait 3 more

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

  

The decade is barely out, but
the jury is already in: The 2000s
were the worst decade since World
War II and “as awful as any peace-
time decade in the nation’s entire
history,” according to Andy Serw-
er of Time Magazine. The evidence
cited? Simply, a lot of bad things
happened between 2000 and to-
day. This is true, but to say that
these constituted an exceptionally
bad 10 years is not only melodra-
matic but shows an astonishing
lack of historical perspective.

First and foremost, there is
that qualiﬁer “peacetime decade”
that makes one realize this nation
hasn’t had many of them. There

were only four decades without ,

American participation in some
war or another in the 20th cen-
tury. If you count the Philippine
Insurrection, general ﬁddling with
Latin America and the invasion of

‘~‘-\¢.:;cs..:-.x..su

Grenada as wars, the ’30s were the
only 10 years of peace we’ve had in
the last 110 years. It’s also disput-
able as to whether our decade, in
which we fought two wars, can be
considered “peacetime.”

What were the decades that
were worse than this one? The
1970s saw the United States lose
South Vietnam to Communism,
the near—impeachment and res-
ignation of its president, double-
digit inﬂation and huge interest
rate hikesto combat it, an energy
crisis, the Iran hostage crisis, the
rise of Japan and the subsequent
weakening of the U.S. auto indus-
try, two recessions, the collapse
of the domestic steel industry,
polyester, bell-bottoms and disco
music.

Similarly, the 1930s were a bad
decade. Unemployment was more
than double what it is now, half the
country dried up and blew away,
a bunch of World War I veterans
got roughed up by, of all things,
the Army. Europe had the Span-

ish Civil War, Stalin’s show—trials,

Hitler’s show—trials and murders-

not even sanctioned by these, an
Italian invasion of Ethiopia during
which poison gas was employed,
the Japanese invasion of China,

the decade with a bang, the Ger-

questions about the necessity _of

saying a word about how much it
will give to the,¢.i.ty, i.r1..291.o..nor.

With the tuition hike and the

“Avatar”

. Starring: Sam Worthington,

Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana
Director: James Cameron
Studio: Twentieth Century Fox

' Grade: B

‘ By the time you read this re-
view, you’ve probably already
heard the hype surrounding “Ava—
tar,”.James Cameron’s astronomi-
cally budgeted epic 15 years in the
making.

“You’ve never experienced
anything like it,” The Los Ange-
les Times assured us. “Avatar is a

state-of-the-art experience that .
g for years to come will deﬁne what

moviescan achieve,” Time Maga-
zine prophesized. Some of your

. friends might have even declared

it the best movie of all time on
their Facebook statuses.

While this ﬁnal claim can ‘be’

dismissed immediately — “Citi-

zen Kane” and “The Godfather”
still trump this blockbuster —— the
others are worth considering. Is
“Avatar” a revolutionary cinematic
experience? V

Well, yes and no. From a tech-
nical standpoint “Avatar” dazzles,
but if you remove all the special
effects you’re left with a very fa-
miliar narrative.

The story is essentially a sci—ﬁ

' take on the “Becoming One with

the Natives” theme: A crippled
former marine named Jake (Sam
Worthington) is dispatched to the
moon Pandora, which is home to
the blue, elongated Na’vi people.
His mission? To bond with the
Na’vi through use of an “avatar,”
an alien body. controlled by his
conscious. Not long after landing

' on the planet, comically exagger-

ated Colonel Quaritch (Stephen
Lang) informs him that they’ve
been trying to excavate a mineral
called Unobtanium (get it?) that

lies under the surface of the Na’vi ‘

home. If Jake doesn’t ﬁnd some
way to get the Na’vi to peacefully

vacate, the colonel and his soldiers

By day, Tammi Hanack is a speech

vgherapist in elementary schools. By

night, she teaches pole dancing at
Fitness With A Twist.

The bubbly redhead looks like a
ﬁtness instructor one might ﬁnd in
any ordinary gym. She refers to the
women in her classes ‘as “my girls,”
and her dancer’s ﬁnesse comes from

years spent as a ballroom dancer.‘ .

However, as she kicks her legs up
to hang upside downfrom the pole
and worms her way to the ﬂoor to
demonstrate a move inher pole in+

éversion class, it’s clear she is not a

typical ﬁtness instructor, and this
is not a typical ﬁtness class.

“I want my girls to see is that
we are just your every-day women
who are just having a great time
and working out together doing
something that’s just a little bit un-
expected, a little eccentric, but it’s
just so much fun that we can’t stop
doing it,” Hanack said.

Hanack began as a ballroom,

dancer and decided to try classes
with friends on awhim. Alter show-
ing off her talents in a student show-
case, the owner, Vanessa Connell,
asked her to teach. V

“The minute I started ﬂying

Pittsburgh. Afterthe episode aired, .

she sought out aﬁtness instructor as
her ﬁrst teacher, and by using videos
and other training, they learned the
dance technique together. Connell
opened her studio in 2006.

That ambition is part of what
keeps Fitness With A Twist fresh.

An elementary ‘Holmes’ ﬂick, my dear Watson

Guy Ritchie’s take on the Sherlock Holmes franchise an entertaining but unfulftlling venture

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ” Writer

“Sherlock Holmes” ,
Starring: Robert Downey]r.,]ude Law,
Rachel McAdams

Director: Guy Ritchie

Studio: Warner Bros. Pictures

Grade: C+

Fans of the mystery and crime genres all know
part of the fun of diving into a new tale is picking
up onthe clues along with the main character, or
maybe beating hint to it.

Theﬁlm “Sherlock Holmes” must have missed
this memo. Despite beingbased heavily onthe Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle stories, followingthe famous
ﬁctional character of the same name, the ﬁlm
instead took the path away from mystery and
focused more on the action.

The ﬁctional face of Sherlock Holmes hasbeen
inthe brains of fans since Doyle conjured him up
more than 100 years ago. Holmes is a renowned
character in ﬁction, with incredible deductive
reasoningskills accompanied byatalentfor acute

- observation and an eccentric personality.

«Downey]r.takingonthe complex and sometimes
ﬂat—out ridiculous character ofHolmes. Athis side

Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures

Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downeyjr.) and Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) stand puzzled.

On screen the two old partners must work
together onwhat is to be their last case as ateam.
It involves suspected black magic and a danger-
ous, terrifying force which rises from the intent
on bringing about the subjugation of England,
America and eventually the entire world.

Theﬁlmportrays the incredible crime ﬁghters
asneedingto use theirﬁsts andbrainstoﬁghttheir
new enernies.Atthe same time both charactersare

supposed to be dealingwith personal issues, such
asWatson’s retirement. In addition to allthat, both
must deal with matters oflove and lust.
Itwas a bold move, but it didn’t pay off.
Instead of allowinga strong plot baseline and
character development, “Sherlock Holmes” car-

ries onthroughthe mysteryswiﬁzlyand chaotically,
withastrongscorethatpounds onthe eardrums

show off the power and danger the detectives
are facing.
The mysteryelementof“SherlockHolmes” is,
in fact, almost completely lost among the chaos.
The settings and sets are more complete

than the characters at times, with costumes 

building designs setting the mood and scene
perfectly.

By the end of the ﬁlm, it’s revealed that Holmes
himselfhad been mentally working through the
casethe entire time, buthadinfactpicked up most
of his clues so early in the ﬁlm that any audience
memberwho mayhave wanted to solve the mys-
tery themselves could hardly have done so in the
short time span spent on the scene holding the
key to the mystery.

Of course, the ending is predictable at best.
The set—up for the villain, including his motive
and crime, is mediocre. The mystery itselfwas
hardly the most complicated of Holmes’ career
and is supposedly connected to a larger crime,
therefore settingthe stage forasequel, or perhaps
an entire franchise.

Most offensive of all, the ending is an ending
that should have beenabegirming. The ﬁlmliter—
allystops as Holmes beginsto suggestalargerplot
thanwhathe and Watson dealtwith for morethan
two hours previously on the screen.

This new take on the character of Sherlock
Holmes needs more work. Perhaps any sequel
will be able to pick up the slack.

In the age of ‘Avatar,’ older
films shine with storytelling

Andy Tybout
Columnist

One of my favorite ﬁlms of all time is Steven
Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park”. It’s not quite a
masterpiece — it’s not memorably acted,
and there are no jaw—dropping twists in the
plot. It’s just one of my favorites and will
continue to be so until the end of time. And
it has nothing to do with technology.

When “Jurassic Park” came out, people
were awed by the swaying, gnashing, beau-
tifully rendered dinosaurs — products of
a burgeoning technology called computer-
generated imagery. But nearly 17fyears after

its release, “Jurassic Park” remains a beloved .

blockbuster — despite the fact that the CGI
is no longer impressive, or even convinc-
ing. That’s because Spielberg was wise —— he
made “Jurassic Park” more endearing than
its special effects.

“Jurassic Park” is still a beloved ﬁlm not
because you are tricked into believing you’re
there on the island with Dr. Grant. Rather,

it’s beloved because it’s an earnest adventure

story with relatable characters. No one thinks
it’s real, of course — viewers just think it’s
a fun ride.

Unfortunately, the virtue of a knowing
suspension of disbelief was largely lost in
the past decade. The blockbusters of to-
day seek, impossibly, to force us into their
worlds, whether through faux—documentary
gimmicks (“Cloverﬁeld”) or 3-D (“Avatar”).
Their aim is to make movies not as artisti-
cally compelling as possible, not as truthful
as possible but as “real” as possible.

Now there’s something to be said for
making ﬁlms seem real, whether through
spot—on dialogueolr a fevvrélatable charac-
ters. But that’s not what the current crop of
blockbusters seeks to accomplish. Rather,
the objective is immersion in the most lit-
eral sense, and it’s built upon a fallacy. As
studios can trick our eyes into believing the
characters are popping out of the screen,
they think we’ll somehow perceive them as

more" authentic — even if they’re tossing off
cheeseball lines of dialogue you’d never hear
a real human say.

Maybe I just can’t see the potential of this
new technology. So let’s imagine, for a mo-
ment, that it’s 2020. Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg is now the President of the United
States. Dippin’ Dots ice cream is ubiquitous,
and in-your-face special effects have reached
their zenith. Now, characters not only “pop”
out of the screen, they wander amongst the
aisles of the theatre, bantering and waging
epic battles.

The only problem with this futuristic sce-
nario is that the screenwriting hasn’t im-
proved. So even when a character appears
to be standing right next to you, he’ll still be
delivering the same canned lines you’ve been
hearing since you were allowed to watch PG-
13 movies. With each “You killed my family,”
or “That was some stunt you pulled back
there,” the veteran audience is reminded
that the character is simply an illusion. The
initial thrill of new technology dissolves into
incredulity. V

This isn’t to say that movies can’t em-
ploy cutting-edge technology and still have
a good story — look at “Lord of the Rings,”
for instance — or that directors should halt
progress in special effects. The fact is that
the focus of movies’ plots should remain on
storytelling, because that’s where the hu-
man connection — the sensation of reality
—- really lies.

The ﬁrst time I saw “Jurassic Park” was in
2002, when I was 12 years old. Movies like
“Spider—Man” and “Star Wars: Episode II”
were ushering in a new era of technological
wonder. Living in such an extraordinary age,
I should have dismissed “Jurassic Park” as‘
cinematically archaic. But I didn’t. It wasn’t
the dinosaurs that inspired me, it was the
thought of journeying through an island of
prehistoric monsters. _

Movie technology, unlike storytelling,
continues to improve at a linear rate. But
it’s the‘ storytelling, not the special effects,
that’ll keep people coming back.

Unfortunately, all the collaborations in

the spirited soundtrack to get their ﬁx.

“Gleeks” of all levels of fanaticism will
ﬁnd solace in this eclectic mix of Pop, R&B
and Broadway standards. Hits made famous
byjohn Lennon, Lily Allen, Van Halen and
The Rolling Stones, among others, have been
rerecorded and reinvigorated by the young

navigate the mine ﬁelds of high school life
and become formidable contenders for their
town’s sectional show choir competition.
They are led and counseled by the passionate
Mr. Will Schuester, played by Golden Globe
nominee Matthew Morrison, who joins in
on the fun by lending his smooth voice to
two tracks on the disk.

When the whole cast unites for songs like
“My Life Would Suck Without You,” the true
spirit of community that resonates in “Glee”

 

shines the brightest.

_ The show is not without individual
standouts, though. One huge example of
this is Golden Globe nominee Lea Michele’s
goosebump-inducing rendition of the Bar-
bara Streisand staple “Don’t Rain on My
Parade.” V

Until April, “Glee” enthusiasts will
only have Simon Cowell’s personal brand
of musical entertainment to look forward
to on Wednesday nights. One song on the
CD will prove to be the voice of the show’s
fan base in these sad months as it tells the
universal truth, “You can’t always get what

The Panthers entered their winter

with hopes of solidifying their
place at the top of the Big East

However, due to upset losses
against Duquesne and Marquette,
the Panthers (11-3, 0-1 Big East)

' After suffering their ﬁrst loss

their previous game, the Panthers
bggnced back with a victory at Aus-
tin Peay on Dec. 20. '

The stellaﬁalay of Austin Peay,

especially the offensive execution
ofjasmine Rayner, challenged the

Panthers throughout the entire ,

game. Pitt trailed for a majority
of the second half, but then Jania
Sims took over. _'

Sims sank a 3-pointer to tie the
game at 71 with only six seconds
remaining. Sims was once again
the hero in overtime as she gave
the Panthers thelead for good with

a jump shot in the ﬁnal 10 seconds

Chelsea Cole also played a vi-

by dominating the boards with a
game-high 19 rebounds, including
four in overtime. '

Duquesne Wins in rare Pitt loss at home

The Panthers 72-63 loss to Duquesne brings the all—time City Game record to 19-9 in Pitt’s favor

Winter Women 4 36

mance pleased head coach Agnus
, Berenato, as she believed it set a
S good foundation for the team. Ber-
enato stressed that, as always, her
team is “a work in progress” and
that the Western Kentucky game
gave her players an opportunity
to develop a better sense of team
identity.

Duquesne 72, Pitt 63
For the Panthers, the Petersen

Events Center is a place where los-
,-_ing is rare. However, Duquesne

broke then—No. 20 Pitt’s 13-gamed

home winning streak with its ﬁrst
victory over a ranked opponent
since 1994.

Plagued by missed free throws
and turnovers, the Panthers trailed
for the entire second half of the
contest.

This disappointing defeat

caused Pitt coach Agnus Berenato
to issue a challenge to her team,
urging players to step up their
court presence and emerge as
leaders.

Berenato also noted that the
Panthers shouldn’t let Pitt’s his-
tory of successful seasons cause
them to become complacent. As a
young team, Berenato said, there
are few players who know noth-
ing but top 25 rankings and Sweet
Sixteen appearances. 3 ‘

One prospective leader for the
Panthers may be Cole, who once‘
again imposed her will on the‘
rebounding efforts with 21 total
boards. 2

Panther players admitted that
changes must be made in order for
Pitt to continue as a ranked pro-
gram. These changes, according
to Panther guard Shayla Scott, are
primarily related to the amount of

defensive intensity shown by the
Panthers.

Berenato even placed blame
for the lackluster performance
on her own coaching technique,
indicating that she might need to
do a better j ob teaching “pitch and
penetrate” concepts that will allow
the Panthers to generate more in-
side scoring opportunities.

This City Game marked the
28th such match—up of cross-town
teams.’ Duquesne, with its 72-63
victory, ‘still trails heavily in the
series, with Pitt leading 19-9 all-

. time. A

Pitt 57, Mount St. Mary’s 47

The Panthers ended their non-
conference schedule with a sound
victory over Mount St. Mary’s,

Panthers drop conference opener

Led by Iania Sims and Sophronia Sallard, the Panthers kicked off Big East play with a 66-55 loss to Marquette

Winter women < 42
ldgfeating the school, saying that she was
excited to coach against them and win, al-
though her “heart is part of the Mount.”
.;.-,.;..,,. «At this point in the season, the main ques-
 for the Panthers is whether or not they
 prepared for the stiff competition that
jjwj gaits them in the Big East conference.
  Berenato, although pleased with the win,
 dted that the Panthers are not quite ready
 conference play and that work still needs
 done, especially in the efforts to control
fuiiforced turnovers. Scott, who contributed
 7§:areer-high 18 points, was also aware of

    

. ltlie diflicult games in the future and stated

that the Panthers have tried to learn about
themselves as a team so that a smooth transi-
tion into Big East play can be made.

  According to Berenato, the Panthers are
1“proud to be in the Big East,” a conference
‘she considers to be the best in the coun-
try. The top two conference teams, Connecti-
cut and Notre Dame, are 12-0 and ranked No.
-1 and 3, respectively, in the most recent AP
and USA Today Polls.

 3 One particular positive from the Mount
St. Mary’s game the Panthers hope to con-
tinue is the high level of energy and intensity
that seemed lacking in previous contests.

Marquette 66, Pitt 55

All of the Panther’s preparation for the
Big East season seemed to be forgotten as
Pitt lost its conference opener to Marquette
onjan. 2. '

The Panthers’ balanced scoring, often
the driving force of its success, was absent

{~EinM the contest.

  Sims ﬁnished with a team-high 20 points

"While Sophronia Sallard contributed 11
points. No other Panthers turned in double-
digit scoring performances.

Another sign of the lack of offensive ef-

fﬁciency is seen in the performance of Ta-
Pffneisha Harrison, Pitt’s leading scorer who

was averaging 14.5 points per game coming
into Big East play. She was held scoreless for
the entire game by the stiﬂing Marquette
defense.

The ﬁeld goal shooting percentage of
the Panthers was also below average. In
fact, Pitt’s averages and the opponents
were nearly reversed. While Pitt averages

around 43 percent from the ﬁeld, it shot for
a mere 26.8 percent. In contrast, Pitt tends
to keep opponents to a shooting percentage
of 33 percent, but Marquette ﬁnished with
43 percent.

Marquette propelled to its lead in the
second half of the game, stretching the Pitt
deﬁcit to as many as 14 points.

Despite Pitt’s height advantage in its front
line and 21 rebounds by Cole, Marquette ‘
managed to outscore the Panthers in the B
paint 16-8.

The Panthers have struggled on the road
thus far in the early season, as two of their
three losses have come during away games
at Penn State and Marquette.

33 free throws in a row, one shy of the school
record held by Jason Matthews, Sean Miller
and Don Hermon.
Senior guardjermaine Dixon and junior for-
’ -"ward Gil Brown’s presence in the lineup helped
the Panthers once again and made it evident just
how much the team missed them for much of
the ﬁrst half of the season.
Dixon had 12 points and hit a3—pointerwith
22 seconds left in the game to put the ﬁnishing

touches on Pitt’s win. _

Brown ﬁnished with six points contributing
an impressive dunk in the ﬁrst half. The two
players will continue to get better as they appear
on court. “I think the team will improve vastly
when Gil and Jermaine get into game shape,”
DePaul coachjerry Wainwright said.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Guardjermaine Dixon

“He’s the best player I’ve played against in

Panthers defeated another — the Bearcats 74-

With the win, Pitt improved to 13-2 on the
season. More importantly, the Panthers are

The Panthers wenton a 7-2 run, capped by a

Gary McGhee dunkwith ﬁve.seconds remaining 1

to end the ﬁrst half and take a 38-32 lead into
the locker" room.

The Bearcats (10-4, 2-1) played strong in
the second half —- tying the game on four
separate occasions — but never held a lead.
They struggled from beyond the arc, shooting
only 25 percent. Stephenson, Gates and Deonta

Vaughn led Cincinnati’s offense, scoring 48 of
their team’s points. A A
Much of Cincinnati’s struggles came because
of a strong second half performance by Gil-
bert Brown. He scored 15 points in the second
half, including a 9-0 individual run during the
middle of the half to keep Pitt’s lead. Brown
ﬁnished the game with 17 points on 7-of—13

The Panthers are currently in ﬁrst place in-

the Big East —— theywere picked to ﬁnish ninth
inthe conference by league coaches ——but play
two of their next three games against ranked

take on the No. 13 Huskies before returning '45
