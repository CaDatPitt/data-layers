Constitution Defemlerl

by BOB GING
News Editor

After several years of work and restructur-
ing committees under three different Student
Government (SG) presidents. a new SG Con-
stitution is finally ready to go to the students
for a vote.

The first restructuring committee. according to
Suzann Slymann. SG Senator and one of the writers
of this constitution. was set up by Ken Schueler.
This committee failed to draft a workable constitu-
tion. and a second restructuring committee was set
up during that summer.

Another constitution was drawn up and submit-
ted to the SG Senate during the Baum administra-
tion. but it failed to pass. Last year. amidst the SG
election havoc. Harris Miller. during the short time
he was SG president—elect. called for another re-
structuring committee. Members of the Senate
worked during the summer and synthesized the
present constitution from two constitutions present-
ed to them.

Gus Avrokatos, SG Senator, explained the the
Constitution was then presented to the Senate, on
three different occasions and when the roll call vote
was taken, all 18 of the Senators present approved
it.

Mike Hout. one of the Constitution writers and
an SG Senator. explained that the main advantage
of the new Constitution is that “it divides up powers.
The executive." he continued. "is divided into four
main areas. Presently one man takes care of all
four functions."

Hout and Pepper Bulick. SG secretary. gave a
breakdown of how the four commission system

The Committee for Rational Alternative.
comprised of Dennis Concilla. Rudy Poten-
zone. Mike Haley. and Lynn Alstadt. has been
recently set up to_ block the passage of the
proposed Student Government (SG) Constitu-
tion.

Following the Towers Lobby debate last evening.
the four aired some of their grievances concerning
the document. Their primary points of disagree-
ment concerned the Allocations Committee and the
lack of an elected official to tie the work of the four
commissioners together.

With respect to the Allocations Committee. the
group believes that the proposed system ignores the
wishes of the elected student representatives. They
would rather see these elected officials have the
final say after the proposals of the committee are
made.

Their main opposition to the proposed Constitu-
tion is that it allows a budget to be formed by rec-
ommendations of the Allocations Committee and not
by recommendations of any elected student repre-
sentatives.

Another criticism which they address to the doc-
ument is that there is no real leadership responsi-
bility given to one member of the board of commis-
sioners. They feel that the leadership be alloted to
one member of the commission. whose responsibil-
ity it would be to coordinate the work of the com-
mission and represent both the commission and the
student body. I

These additional members would also be given
the power to approve the SG budget, which, as it
stands will only be approved by the commissioners.

circulating a petition to have

(men residents J  Forbes stated
that it “really doesn't govern in
any way."

The former MDC member noted
a number of examples of the Coun-
cil‘s alleged inefficiency. The first
cited was the trip the Council took
to Ontario last year.

Forbes noted that “only certain
members were allowed to go. The
presidents roommate. who was
not a member of the Council. was
allowed to go with the group.

“T ‘s trip was in no way a cul-
tural (change. It was just a

fling." he asserted. “This was a

blatant example of MDC‘s knack
for wasting money allotted to

them by the University.“

Another example cited by
Forbes is MDC’s distribution of

refrigerators. He stated, “They
rent them and make a sizeable
profit. It should be done at cost
and as a service to the students.
“Presently. MDC is making a
$12 profit on each refrigerator
they rent for $34. Then the Coun-
cil does nothing with the profit to
benefit the students in the Tow-

members of the Committee for

posed to the adoption of the new
Constitution.

In answer to various questions.
Klavonic explained the fallacies
of the present SG. The president
pointed out that although the stu-
dent body elected 25 senators.
an average of only ten show up for
meetings. Klavonic exclaimed.
"I‘m spread too thin. Power
shouldn't be in the hands of one
man to appoint his friends to SG.“

Klavonic attempted to clear up
the misconceptions about the Al-
locations Committee which will
remain nearly unchanged under
the new Constitution.

He emphasized that the Alloca-
tions Committee does not make
any decisions concerning budget
allocations. Its sole purpose is to
recommend how SG should allo-

cutting budgets submitted by stu-
dent organizations.

Opponents to the Constitution
rejected Klavonic‘s explanation
of the Allocations Committee, de-
claring that the Senate merely
ruber—stamped recommen-
dations made by the committee.
They asked repeatedly why a bu-
reaucracy should have the final
say on how student activity fees
should be spent.

Klavonic defended his position
by pointing out that the Senate al-
located funds for Pitt News sal-
aries over the objections of the
Allocations Committee. Terry
Phillips, a member of the com-
mittee, confirmed Klavonic’s as-
sertion that the Senate does not
rubber stamp its recommenda-
tions.

The only change in Allocations
Committee is that it will make its
recommendations to the Social
Commission rather than to the
Senators. The Social Commission
will be made up of nine members
elected to better represent the
various segments of the Univer-
sity.

One member will be elected
from Men‘s Dormitory Council
(MDC) and another from Wom-

will represent the Commuter As-
sociation and another the School

 Poet Leroi Jones in addressing

 L =re‘nce_ Hall Thursday night said
 that the “struggle is how we can
begin to make strides towards
 achieving national liberty.“

. "_tical power. “Over the years,

'  T According to Jones, Blacks are
, ‘revolutionary by their color
 alone, meanings Black is the
 *7t'irst things with which they are
g-‘l’i'dentified to to identify him."
The ‘Nigger’ is based onrace.”
He pointed out that the Black
 man with a Harvard education,
, ~. and a Black millionare is a

.living in ghettos.

Another purpose of the Black
nationalist is to gain power. he
said. by “bulding a strong Black
political party, from the level
of nationalism to Pan African-
ism. to a World African Poli-
tical Party.“

He insisted that the primary
problem of the Black community
is that “Most of the people do
not know their oppressor. All are
committed to some sort of white
people.“ i

He contended that Black people
must work to change the minds
of the people and that no one
institution can keep 30 million
people oppressed unless they want
to be. “But also." he went on.
"no one small group” can bring
about a revolution; it is the peo-
ple who can. and will be the rev-
olutionl"

He explained that cultural
revolution is changing the minds
of the people. “Revolution be-
gins with a voice inside the skull.
and the first step is discipline.
The individuals own life style
must be the example of what he is
talking about. You must live ac-
cording to your own ideology."

He again pointed out that
“Alliances are needed to defeat
the concept of isolationism.
Revolution must become the spine
of the Black community." and
whenever a contradiction to the
Black community is built inside
of it by the white man. don‘t
leave it alone. control it." He
used the Poverty Program as an
illustration of the point.

The poet explained that. Black

power is the power to impose. \

will. maintain power. and touch
every aspect of Black con-
sciousness.“ He said that the
revolution is to “gain political
power for Black people. for self
determination."

After his speech. Jones read
several of his poems.

The last poem was. “The Na-
tion is Like Ourselves." in which
he expressed the idea meaning
that what ever the US. is do-
ing. or being. is what the Black
man helped to build. “The dead
Negro is fertilizer for the fields."
it concluded; ending Imamu
Ameer Baraka's lLeroi Jones‘)
speech.

last Poets: “Niggers, Scared of Revolution”

by JOYCE BENDER

Every seat was filled, every
wall was lined three to four peo-
ple deep. people sat in the aisles
and in the area just in front of the
stage in the double lecture halls
of 120 and 121. and all stayed
from 7 til 9:15 last Friday night
to hear the message of the Last
Poets.

The concept of the group came
about when South African Little
Richard Copisielle predicted.
"guns and rifles will take over
the world and we are today liv-
ing in the last days.“ hence they
called themselves the Last Poets.

‘Adgesian Akinlori. Omar‘ Ben
Hassan. and Alafia Pudim are
the Last Poets. They are "three
individuals who'came together
for the total liberation of the
black people." Alafic proclaimed.
“we must git our values together
for our total liberation.“ A

‘The Poets consider themselves
teachers of the uninformed black
peoples. Alafia declared. “We
are not an art. we are an action.
We are not here to entertain you.
We are here to teach! "

The poetry illustrated the con-
cern of the group for raising the
level of consciousness of black
people. The poems enacted the
black situation. predicted the
black dream.

PROLOGUE

After reading Kenneth Brown's
The Brig, I read Julian Beck’s
book The Living Theatre. He orig-
inally produced and staged
Brown's play. Beck talked about
the aims of “Living Theatre" . . .
“to increase conscious aware-
ness, to stress the sacredness of
life, to break down the walls."

It’s that language too, real life
gut verse—that Brown used——-as
described by Beck, that is essen-
“tially important in this work. The
Brig is a long way from where
"The Living Theatre” began in

New York. It ‘meant growth for

this group of theatre beings——who.
for a number of years have stuck
together . . . working and stand-
ing up for the kind of theatre they
have strove for . . . continually.

I talked to Martin Kushner, Adi-
rector. What a fantastic theatrical
soul. For him, the theatre I talk
and write about is a real life shak-
ing experience. I don’t disagree
with that and neither does Beck,
but its the failure of theatre to al-
ways provide those experiences
that limits everyone’s experience

‘ ’With_ it.

Is The Brig one of those power-
ful elements, I though? Do I really
call this theatre? No plot. . . .
Plenty of structure. . . . Real life
and words that crackle with soul.
But . . . . .

I quote Beck . . . “To break
down the walls. How can you
watch The Brig and not want to

break down the walls of all the
prisons‘? Free all prisoners. De-
stroy all white’ lines everywhere.
All the barriers. But talking about
this to people is not enough. To
make people feel that whenever
the noise of triumph is heard—the
noise of opening night applause.

_that nothing else can be heard but

that of the resounding cement and
steel corridors of prisons. Let

them hear the noise. let it cause

them pain, let them feel the blows
to the stomach. produce a horror
and release real feeling. let this
happen until there are no prisons
anywhere." A

THE BRIG

It was—it had to be—a gut re-
action. Right there on stage—the
gate closed SNAP—and the white
light SNAP—‘I‘m in a brig I thought

. . it‘s real. Those kids on stage
were working their guts out.

I sat there-writing, then drift-
ing off—then writing again.

Why was I drifting off? I did it
once and did it again. I tried not
to feel uncomfortable. Was it the
play or was it the play? It is ac-
curacy here—Kushner has really
done quite a job. It is a brig.--I am
sure of that.

Brown’s beautiful language is
lost though. They‘ve internalized
their experiences, except fora
few, and I can‘t understand them.
They’re in a brig——but they‘re not
telling us. I am a separate audi-
ence——not until a good deal of time
had past did I clearly understand
"Permission to cross the white
line. sir!“

tastic performance. He is also
clear and crisp—I understand
him. He is impressing me to no
end. What an actor. Robert Conci-
lus and Donald Young are magni-
ficantly strong and expressive.
Their expressions show merger
between gut and technique. The
whole cast work so hard—such

not enough in one sense and an-
other.

this whole thing. Yet not until the
latter half of the second" act did I
really get that experience——into
this thing they call Brig. They
were running and screaming and
the water was splashing. They
were breathing harder and hard-
er and the sparks flew straighter.
That last 20 minutes POW! But it
was almost two hours long, with
a ridiculous and unplanned thing
they devised to seat everyone.

EPILOGUE

It was hardly worth that 20 min-
utes for me. I think that at times I
was really bored. Maybe it's the
plays I've seen or the books I've
read. Heaven knows .I‘ve seen
more than my share. I am a critic
and I don‘t see this as theatre, at
least. total theatre——half theatre
maybe?

Its this play, with all its real-
ism. But then, is theatre realism?
That Marine training film I saw
two years ago moved me more.
Yes, I agree that was real. Al-
right. I was consciously aware

. the sacredness of life was
stressed . . . I got the same feel-
ings also——watching the Baltimore
Colts on the backfield. The guts
flew then too!

The emotion is there. Do you
want to be a Marine? Are you not
aware that the prisoner and the
guard do exist . . . so viciously

bounding at the gate. Are you pre-I Tm  
pared to join in this Kenneth

tivities calendar and the four com-

Mike Haley argued that the stu-
dent body should be given a chance
try “true democracy” and be per-
mitted to elect its representatives
at large.

Klavonic retorted that the new
plan will allow for elections that
will be more representative of the
student body. “Instead of having
19 out of 25 senators being from
one segment of the University.
such as the Commuter, Associa-
tion or the Greeks, we will have
nine people elected to represent
all segments of the University.”

Asked why the University has
“lousy entertainment” on week-
ends and for Homecoming, the SG
president explained the various
difficulties encountered in signing
big-name groups for Pitt.

Many times there is just no
group who can accommodate it-
self to the dates left open on a
schedule determined by the Chan-
cellor and the Athletic Committee.

Most of the time, however, SG
cannot raise the funds asked by
groups such as Led Zeppelin that
ask upwards of $60,000 for a cam-
pus appearance.

Klavonic explained that ar-
rangements for weekend dances
were the responsibility of MDC
and Women‘s Housing Board who
had been allocated $1,500 for such
purposes. At this point the formal
question-answer format turned
into an argument between Concil-
la and Klavonic as the MDC treas-

' ' urer defended the lack of activity
 by the council.

(Continued from Page 1)

1 According to Concilla. the ideas
put forth by his group are "an ex-
periment in democracy." geared
at bringing the mechanisms and
workings of SG back to the hands
of the students.

M V, Lenny Klavonic

* Now, through the efforts of
and many
other leaders, a new document
is finally ready for the final

‘ ‘approval by the students. Com-
. prised of the best of two pre-

vious proposals and several new
ideas, the constitution is up for
a referendum today and for
the next two days.

The proposed constitution
has many strong points. The

duties of SG president, which

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
   

 

over the past’ few years have
grown too cumbersome for one
person to handle, have been
divided up into four areas:
academic, social, programming,
and committees. This break-
down will allow each com-

Washington — .(CPS) — Army
draftees have almost twice as
high a chance of being killed
in Vietnam as non-draftee en-

listed men, according to U.S.

Army study.

During 1969, draftees were
killed at the rate of 31 per 1,-
000 and injured at the rate of
203 per 1,000, while first term
enlistees were killed at the
rate of 17 per 1,000 and injur-
ed at the rate of 120 per 1,000.

The reason draftees tend to be
killed at a much higher rate is
that the Army, in a procedure
different from previous wars,
allows men who enlist for three
years to choose what job they
want. Because of this, draftees

who make up 56 percent of

the men entering the Army,

tend to make up a much higher _

percentage of combat units.

William K. Brehm, assistant
secretary of the Army for man-
power and reserve affairs, ex-
plains that “the popular jobs
are the ones for which people

missioner to become more in-
volved in his particular area
and thus do a better job. Fur-
ther, each commissioner will
have an increased responsibility
in his area.

Having four
can also serve as an important
safety measure. It is not fair
to ask one person to fulfill all
the duties of SG president. But
more importantly. having four
commissioners will prevent one
person from getting control
and using the office to his
own advantage.

Night students will have a
say about where their money
goes if the new constitution is
passed—something they didn’t
have before, even though they
pay a $4 activity fee.

The proposed document
brings all the academic cabin-
ets on campus together, it
standardizes all elections in
January, and it makes for a
standardized and fair system
of appointments, replacing a
“spoils system” which has been
followed up to now.

Further. the 25 Senators. not-
ed. for their absenteeism. will
be replaced by a nine member
board. This will increase their
responsibility to the students as
well as their flexibility.

Now, with all these improve-
ments, it seems that the neces-
sary restructuring of Student
Government can finally occur.

enlist. They don’t enlist for
the hard-core combat skills.
That is why draftees tend to
populate the hard-core combat
skills: 70 percent of the in-
fantry, armor and artillery are
draftees.”

A Defense Department
manpower expert, who refused

to be quoted by name, told a ‘

reporter for National Journal,
a newsletter which requested
the Army study, that “‘we‘ve
studied this problem very care-
fully. People don’t deem to
enlist in the Army to fight.
We recognize the inequity this
causes in a shooting war. but
we don’t know what to do
aboutit.“

College graduates are slight-
ly less likely to be assigned to
combat duty but there are no
figures separating draftees from
enlistees among college gradu-
ates. 36.2 percent of the gradu-
ates who entered the Army in
1969 were assigned to combat
jobs, compared with the overall

commissioners ‘

Within the past few weeks.
however. anonymous leaflets
have been passed out on cam-
pus and mailed to some com-
muters.

These charged Klavonic with
being power-hungry and attack-
ed the “student government
gang” who were responsible for
the constitution. In the several
different anti-constitution
flyers being passed out, the
unsigned writers have gone to
gre‘t pains to cast doubts on
the present Student Govern-
ment leaders, questioning their
motives and integrity. '

To say that the arguments in
the leaflets are ridiculous and
without validity is to make an
understatement.

The big question is on the
motives and integrity of the
writers. who didn't even have
enough faith ‘in what they were
saying to sign their names. It
seems clear that the wanton
slashes in the flyers are entirely
without substance, and were
put there only to make a quick.
sensational impression . . .
enough to cast a small doubt
and maybe enough to change a
vote.

The Pitt News condemns the
authors of these scandal sheets
as well as the ideas expressed
in them, and recommends that
students base their opinions on
other sources of information.

There can be no possible
benefits in keeping the present

 Draftees Killed More Than Enlistees

rate of 43.3 percent. 61 percent
of the graduates were draftees.

The higher death rate of
draftees in Vietnam would have
been aided by an amendment
to the military procurement
bill, which would have barred
the sending of draftees to
Vietnam unless they volunteer-
ed to go. The amendment, auth-
ored by Sen. William Prox-
mire, (D-Wisc.), was rejected
by a vote of 22-713..

The Army says it has no
figures on the chances of a
draftee serving in Vietnam. but
other figures indicate that
8,000 draftees are sent to Viet-
nam each month. The monthly
draft call has been running
about 10,000. 30 percent of all

-draftees then in the Army were

serving in Vietnam on July 1.
compared with 25 percent of
first term enlistees.’

Many persons, including Sen.
Proxmire, feel that the three-
year enlistees should not be able
to opt out of combat while
draftees must fiths; the Army
is apparently unwilling to re-
move the provision because en-
listments might drop, forcing
a drastic rise in draft calls.
“As strange as it sounds." Brahm
said, “only 800 young men a
month out of 200 million
Americans are enlisting for
combat. If we went to an
all-volunteer force in Vietnam.
it’s quite conceivable that that‘s
all we might get.“

by JERRY NORTON
“All Power to the People! “

A wrong-righting rally. rock
festival. or rock-throwing isn‘t
complete today without some
would-be Robespierre chanting
that slogan. Admittedly it con-
tains no words longer than two
syllables, which places it with-
in the intellectual reach of
most New Leftists. but one still
wonders if they know what it
means.

The average person might be
tempted to say it means major-
ity political rule, but then, in
a race between Spiro Agnew
and Jerry Rubin it‘s highly
doubtful the latter would win.

The defensive New Leftist
could claim, with his Military-
Industrial-Complex-under-every-
bed mentality, that the people
don’t actually control nomina-
tions and elections.

Assuming that's correct and
assuming it was changed,
would the Silent Majority
vote the Cleaver-Rubin ticket?
Doubtful, right? So majority
rule is not what they have in
mind.

Maybe what they mean is
_power to particular people.
We concede, it would be time-
consuming to shout “All power
to radical student, radical
drop-outs, militant blacks, poor
whites who didn’t vote for Wal-
lace, and Dr. Spock,“ but the
shorter version tends to mislead
those humans who always
thought of themselves as peo-
ple. .
Only our friendly neighbor-
hood New Leftist knows for
sure. of course. who goes up
against the wall and who
doesn‘t.

The sad. truly sad, thing is
that such a hackneyed slogan
is typical of a revolution that
is supposed to represent some-
thing radically new. Revolu-
tion after revolution in history
has claimed to act‘ for “the
people,” whoever they are,
and “‘the people” have served

 

as an excuse for countless acts
of savagery and despotism.

When New Left leaders’.
scream “All power to the peo-
ple,“ it’s evident from their
actions—shooting down speakers
they don't want to hear, block-
ading classes they don't want
others to attend—-that they mean
“all power to us as the people’s
self-appointed representatives.
and if the people don’t know
what’s good for them they bet-
ter get out of our way." Hitler
and Stalin were sure they were
doing what was best for "the
people” too‘; .

The substantive part of this
slogan is “all power.” The days
of Flower Children and Gentle
People are long gone. Now the
New Left wants power, and
that power means coercion and
violence, including burning,
bombing and shooting. Nothing
original about that.

When the Establishment does

it the New Left says sarcastical-V .

ly that it’s killing for peace.
Considering that, and consider-
ing it was the New Left was
criticized the officer who claim-
ed he had to destroy the Viet-
namese town in order to save
it, one wonders how the New
Left gained a reputation as be-
ing less hypocritical than older
generations.

The New Left loves every-
one, except the Middle Class,
Pigs, and people over 30. The
New Left is against war abroad,
but for it here at home. Napalm
is bad, firebombs are good. The
New Left is for the people,

Except when the people dis-

agree with it.

The crux of the matter is that
to substitute the New Left for
the Old Establishment would
simply mean to substitute one
group of rulers for another,
and if we judge by their words
and actions there is every rea-
son to believe that far more peo-
ple would die because of New
Left repression than died at
Kent of Jackson State.

Would you really prefer “the
people” to have all the power
over your life, power backed
by the coercion of the state, or
would you rather “the people”
and the state lose some of the
power they already have over
your life?

A much better slogan, and a
much more radical and original
one. would “All power to the
individual." Let neither Mark
Rudd nor an Establishment
bureaucrat, but the individual
himself make his own decisions
about his own life.

 

 

 

   

 

Steiuberg’s Logic Twisted

Dear Editor: (The Pitt News)

As a male resident of the Towers. I am dis-
gusted with the unpardonable manner in which
Arnie Steinberg. head of the Men‘s Dormitory
Council. (MDC) the governing body of the male
residents of the Towers. has used his position to
involve himself and the Men‘s Dorm Council in
the Student Government Referendum on a new
constitution.

In the November 12 issue of (The Pitt News).
Steinberg. speaking as president of MDC. con-
condemned the proposed Constitution in an inane
article that combined twisted logic with misrepre-
sentation. Steinberg had no right to use the office
of MDC president as a soap box.

Then at an MDC meeting in 306 SU Thursday
night Steinberg and MDC TreasurerDennis Con-
cilla (who is illegally serving on MDC in the
first place. since he is a co—ed dorm dweller»
spent the entire agenda time of two hours not on
MDC business but on denouncing the proposed
constitution and excoriating Student Government
President Lenny Klavonic.

The meeting itself was illegal in the first
place. since a quorum was not present. Then a
resolution condeming the new Student Gov-
ernment constitution was presented for a vote.

Five voted for the resolution. four against.
and two persons abstained. Thus the resolution

 cannot be said to have legally passed for two rea-

sons: a majority of those present didn‘t vote for it.

and a quorum was not present in the first place.

Yet Steinberg permitted Suzann Slyman. a
member of the’ constitutional revision committee
only a minimal amount of time to present the
case for the new Constitution.

It‘s interesting to note that although Steinberg
can find the time to involve MDC in matters
that concern it not. he can‘t seem to find the time
to involve MDC in matters that concern MDC.

Steinberg received $750 in Student Govern-
ment allocations to provide entertainment for the
Towers population. Yet he can‘t seem to find the
time to schedule dances or similar events.

Steinberg made nearly $300 from the renatal
of refrigerators in the dorms. Yet he has done
nothing to return this money to the Towers resi-
dents in any form. as social events or services.

Arnold Steinberg would do better to use his
office as MDC president to concern himself with
MDC business instead of involving himself in
matters that in now way concern MDC.

I had initially intended to vote against the
new Constitution. but after observing the levels
to which its opponents have stooped. and after
noticing that no one has yet presented a valid
argument against the new constitution — all that
I have seen so far are personal attacks upon
Lenny and empty headed arguments — I have de-
cided to reverse myself and vote FOR the new
Student Government Constitution.

Steinberg Re-Defends

To the Editor

In a recent Pitt News, I ex-
pressed my views against the
proposed _SG Constitution. I
haven‘t always held these views
however. Nearly a month ago.
I as an SG Senator. voted for the
Constitution.

The reaons for this move were
many. Basically I voted for
that Constitution because of my
ignorance of the necessity for real
reform.

From talks with students and
especially from my own exper-
ience. I cannot see how this
Constitution will solve‘ the basic
problem of SG the managemer.t
of our student activity fees.

In the past. the Allocations
Committee, a group of appoint-
ed bureaucrats. was left alone
to handle our money. Of course.
the Committee had to get ap-
proval from the Senate. but I‘ve
been at the meetings when the
Senate considered the budget.

I don‘t think any of
Senators knew what the budget
was really about.

_ There is nothing really sin-
ister about this except that the
Senators were supposedly elected
to represent and lead students.
But. of course. that‘s the myth.
The Allocations Committee does
all of that. We. the elected repre-
sentatives. just rubber stamp the

the '

Committee’s proposals. The proof
of this point is that the Senate
can't approve any money unless
the Allocations Committee rec-
ommends it.

The proposed Constitution is

not going to change this quasi-~

democratic situation.

What we need is a real change.
First. the Allocations Com-
mittee should function advise elec-
ted students in their decisions on
the use of the student's money.

Second. we need a commis-__'

sion approach to government.

But this commission should

have the power to determine the ‘”‘"'

budget. There should also be
some official representative or
chairman of the commission so

there will be some leadership--.

and coordination . in Student
Government. "

(The proposed constitution
thinks 4 people with equal

power will somehow work with
each other even though there is
no historical precident for this
contention)

What we need is government
that works for everyone. not for
the appointed few. Student Gov-
ernment will only survive if it
works. not if it satisfies some
ideological view of life.

Arnie Steinberg
MDC President
SG Senator

Constitution Landed

To the Editor.

After reading the interview of
Arnie Steinberg. MI)C Presi-
dent and SG Senator. in the last
issue of The Pitt News, I can
only conclude that Steinberg is
even more misinformed than the
majority of the student body.

How can Steinberg consider
himself a representative of the
student interest when « for 8
months he has sat on committees
investigating the new constitution
and approving it and even going
so far as to cast a final “YES"
vote as a Senator and then stat-
ing. " a look at the constitution
will reveal that it is very ideal-
istic" and "that it wasn't real-
istic to envision four separate
people working and cooperating
that closely." Yet working and
cooperating closely is exactly
what the councils and committees
of this University do.

I feel that the MDC President
has made a gross mistake in sta-
ting that the new Constitution
calls for a number of elections
during each year. The new con-
stitution clearly calls for all elec-
tions in the 3rd week in January
with all appointments to be made
within 3 weeks.

According to Steinberg. Al-
locations would have to respond
to no elected student. Article V.
section A. parts 2 and 3 state
that members of Allocations Com-
mittee will be approved by a
two-thirds vote of a joing meet-
ing of the University Senate
Council representatives and that
recommendations made by the
Allocations Committee will be
approved by the undergraduate
student representatives to the
University Senate Council and
the Social Commission of the
Student Association.

That makes a total of nine
elected students. In both the cur-
rent and the new Constitutions.
the Allocations Committee merely
recommends.

At the present time 25 Sena-
tors vote on what happens to our
money. It» would be better for
9 representatives of the entire
including General

’  ...._'.$$utti.es.-.which,irigttttnpw.  ;. .

 

$4 activities fee and has no vote,
to determine financial priorties
with my money. than for those
few of the Senators who are in-

terested enough to come to meet- ’

ings.

Steinberg's statement that
conflicts exist in the division of
duties given to the 4 commis-
sioners is absurd, and an out-
right lie. The Constitution clear-
ly states that the duties of each
commissioner and there is no con-
filct or overlap.

The MDC president clains
that "The S. G. Gang“ wants to

«"fit their own ambitions by mak-

ing impeachment and amendment
proceedings easy. these hinging
on easily acquired petitions by
five percent of the student body.”

This “easily acquired" 5 per
cent would consist of 950 stu-
dents. which is about 500 more
than
elected.

Even then, impeachment pro-
ceedings would be brought be-
fore a judiciary body and an
amendment would have to be sub-

mitted to the entire student body ‘

for approval.

Exactly. who is the Student
Government “gang”? It has
taken three years of open hear-
ings. committee studies. an en-
tire political party of seniors,
campus leaders. who ran on the
platform that a new Constitution
was needed, several reviews of
different constitutions. a study
undertaken by the current Sen-
ate and approval by a role call
vote of two-thirds of the current
senate to finally get a new Con-
stitution.

In answer to your query,
“What‘s to stop them from mak-
ing the top 4. selfperpetuating?’
According to the Constitution,
you will notice that they are
elected by the student body.
Exactly. why is Steinberg so
afraid of replacing 1 man with
4. a situation better suited to the
needs of the students‘?

I urge, sincerely urge, the stu-
dents at this school to vote “YES__”
for the new constitution.

University

At present the United States
faces a crisis in the area of fuel
and energy production which may
have dire long-range conse-
quences; in some local instances.
mild effects are already being
felt. ~

Several conflicting factors have
forced the nations energy pro-
ducers into an uncomfortable cor-
ner. The energy demand in this
country has excreased exponen-
tially in recent years (conserva-
tive estimates predict a 63 per
cent increase in energy consump-
tion in the next ten years). At-
tempts to cope with the demand
are stifled by evidence that re-
serves of basic fuels are depleted.

The production-demand ratio for
oil and natural gas liquids (NGL)
has been diminishing for several
decades, and its continued deple-
tion is assumed. Petroleum tends
to be high in sulfur content, lead-
ing to pollution of the air by sulfur
dioxide. Pipelines for NGL cannot
presently meet an increased de-
mand.

COAL PLENTIFUL

Coal, on the other hand, though
infinitely plentiful (850 billion
untapped tons. enough to last 1.-
000 years). has its own problems.
Again, sulfur content is a factor.
Coal that does not produce sulfur
dioxide usually has a high ash
content and that leads to air parti-
culate.

International crises cloud the
picture further. The Middle East
imbroglio has forced the U.S. to
take on at least partial responsi-

bility for bailing out our West
European allies, should the oil
valves in the Middle East be turn-
ed off. The U.S. simply hasn‘t the
capacity to maintain such a situa-
tion for any length of time.

Also in the international frame
of reference, the wealth of coal
here is more apparent than real.
Great coal veins of high quality,
low sulfur coal are pre-co,ntract-
ed to foreign nations as well as to
major U.S. steel producers. Thus,
coal which is non-polluting is dif-
ficult to come by. '

Attempts are being made by air
pollution fighters (both private
groups and the Department of
Health. Education. and Welfare)
to restrict the burning of coal with
greater than one per cent sulfur
content. The Pittsburgh air vari-
ance board has set the limit at
1.65 per cent. ‘

This limit would eliminate con-
sumption of 80 per cent of the vast
Appalachian coal belt.

There are ways, however, to
prevent a severe scarcity. Coal
can be scrubbed of its fulfur con-
tent; utility companies, major air
pollution offenders, rarely if ever
scrub their raw coal-—it’s cheap-
er that way, and heat production
is increased. ‘

What does this mean for Alle-

 

SdfeFr0m Fuel Shortage

It does that already, but owing to ,_ 
the organic nature of the sulfur,‘.g{j

.. t‘

gheny County? Possibly a lot. Coal
reserves are down at many major
power producing stations in the
East. The Tennessee Valley Au-
thority plants are down to 6-10
day back-up reserves from their
usual 65-day supply. The Feder-
al Power Commission announced
on Nov. 2 that of major utilities
in cities, one of every four com-
panies will not be able to cope
with black-outs this winter.

Harold F. York, coordinator of
the Pittsburgh Office of Mineral
Resources for the Bureau of
Mines. said that we “can expect
some brown-outs or worse in the
next few years. Should the HEW
limitations go through. you may
experience black-outs on some
really nippy days. New York and
the coast cities have a much
worse situation. We are consider-
ed in good shape. but utilities
have agreements and we may be
tapped when things go too badly
there.“

UNIVERSITY SAFE

No one is likely to get too chilly
here at the University. Pitt. sup-
plied with steam heat produced
at the Bellefield Boiler Plant in
Panther Hollow, is hooked up with
the heating systems for the YM

lon University. No matter what
the weather. sufficient amounts
of coal will be brought in to keep
these institutions open.

Still, the plant has its troubles.
As an air polluter in the Oakland
area, the Pittsburgh Air Vari-
ance Board has given the plant un-
til January of 1972 to show how it
can bring its 1.9-2.1 sulfur level to
the acceptable 1.65 level. The
plant cannot do that by scrubbing.

Lettuce Boycott

Pickets support the lettuce boycott outside of the Oakland A & P

Support of the lettuce boycott
is being urged by a group of
representatives from the United
Farm Workers Union of Cali-
fornia. At a metting in the Stu-
dent Union on Thursday. the four
delegates delved into the back-
ground and present plight of the
farm workers.

According to the representa-
tives. the farm workers are seek-
ing recognition of their own union.
independent of the company-sup-
ported Teamsters.

The workers maintain that the
Teamsters are willing to pull out.
but the growers are holding them
to their contract. This is an attempt
by the company to prevent the
labor from organizing under
Cesar Chavez‘ United Farm
Workers. the group claimed.

They consider the disadvantages
of the Teamster contract to be that
it lacks provisions for pesticide
control. sanitary facilities. and a
cost of living escalator. The work-
ers allege that non-union lettuce
(sometimes labeled "iceberg")
may be poisonous due to the chem-
icals the company uses to harden
the heads.

President Arnie Steinberg held a
copy of Wednesdays Pitt News.
stating that “this was done as an
individual effort. not in represen-
tation of MDC.“ The article Stein-
berg referred to expressed his
condemnation of the proposed
Constitution of the Student As-
sociation.

Later in the meeting. Steinberg
and MDC Treasurer Dennis Con-
cilla suggested that MDC initiate
a formal condemnation against
the proposed constitution. It was
moved and seconded by Lynn Al-
stadt and Dennis Concilla. re-
spectively. that MDC initiate a
condemnation.

Of the eleven MDC represen-
tatives present. four voted yes
(to condemn the constitution).
and two voted no. anf four ab-
stained.

A second resolution was pas-
sed to conduct a study of the con-
stitution and to work on an al-
ternative document.

Concilla objected to the pro-
posed constitution. stating. “it
says nothing about budget com-
mittees. and allocations could pos-
sibly read undefined powers into
the document. Student Govern-
ment's (SG) present structure is

denounced SG as a "self-perpet-
rating monarchy.“

"Our immediate concern." Con-
cilla continued. "is that the pro-
posed constitution be defeated.“

Suzanne Slyman. one of the
members of a study committee
for restructuring SG. delivered a
short rebuttal to MDC's resolu-
tion. She stated that. even if the
allocations Committee read into
the document any unwritten powers.
the SG Senate still has the au-
thority to veto anything that Allo-
cations proposes.

Slyman then asked Steinberg
why. as an SG Senator. he had
not voted against the constitution
when it came before the Senate.

Steinberg answered. "I ques-
tioned it. but the responses were
evasive and coy. I never got any
straight answers. I sat on the SG
Senate. After this week MDC
may not be in the best relations
with the Allocations Committee
and the Senate."

Steinberg added that he be-
lieves that the budget is "more
or less ramrodded through." and
that the proposed constitution is
being "forced down students‘
throats."

VMedical Competence Questionable

Pitt News Wary of Ads  

by BOB LEDERMAN
Business Manager

The Pitt News has received
several advertisements from out-
of-state abortion clinics soliciting
clients for their services. These
advertisements were sent to the
Pitt News by its national adver-
tising agency. servicing college
newspapers across the country.

We have talked with the direc-
tor of the ad agency and discov-
ered there is no attempt being
made to check out the medical
or technical competence of the
staffs in these abortion clinics.

The Pitt News believes it
would be doing a disservice to its
readers submitting them to pos-
sible medical complications and
physical danger if it ran these ad-
vertisements. Pitt News readers

are also aware that the State of.

Pennsylvania laws. as they now
exist. prohibit the performance of
abortions.

For this reason. The Pitt News
will not accept any out-of-state
abortion clinic advertisements.

Persons wishing abortion coun-
seling can avail themselves of
the services provided by the fol-
lowing organizations in Pitts-
burgh and Pennsylvania:

If an abotrion is recommended
by the attending physician, a

patient is better off having it
done locally, to insure continuity
of medical care in the event that
complications arise."

He concluded: "Besides. adver-

that this will lead to an ‘abor-

practices so far this year, SG will
begin a concentrated effort to
fight back against what SG Pres-
ident Lenny Klavonic terms "out-
right extortion by absentee land-
lords."

According to Klavonic. "Re-
cent Supreme Court rulings in the
state of Michigan permitted rent-
ers to use their rent money to re-
pair substandard conditions and
give the landlord the receipts as
payment for the monthly rent.
Right now there is a case in the
courts to determine whether or
not rent need be paid at all in sub-

would work. The Social Commis-
sion, according to Miss Bulick.
would be far more representative
under the new Constitution since
its membership would consist of
two commuters, one male dorm
resident, one female dorm resi-
dent. and one student from Gener-
al Studies. all of whom would be
elected. V

At present, General Studies stu-
dents have no representative in
SG, but pay a sizeable portion of
the activities fee.

The Programming Commission,
Hout suggested. would take care
of Freshman Orientation and any
spontaneous events, such as the
Moratorium, Elections, and Earth
Day.

The commission which would
deal with committees is set up
with the idea that it will be re-
sponsible for the daily adminis-
tration of SG, such as finances.
budget and the working of SG
committees. The fourth commis-
sion is the Academic Commission
which will coordinate the academ-
ic cabinets, such as the Liberal
Arts Cabinet and Nursing Cabinet.

One of the major objections to
the new Constitution has been the
role of the Allocations Commit-
tee. Suzann Slymann explained
that contrary to what many peo-
ple have been saying, the deci-
sions of the Allocations Commit-
tee are final “only to the extent
that they recommend to the Social
Council and four commissioners
and these people have the final

decision. The only function of the
allocations is to do nitty-gritty
work.

Avrokatos went on to say that
"the two main things about the
proposed Constitution are that it‘s
simple and flexible. The bylaws
will make things more specific
and clarify the vagueness. These
things can only be worked out by
the people who then run the SG.”

In conclusion, Hout pointed out
that “since Pitt has gone state-
related, there have been many ad-
ministrative and faculty changes.
but as of yet, there has been no
corresponding change in SG. May-
be it‘s about time."

 

standard housing.“

The first task of the SG Off-
Campus Housing Committee will
be to mobilize Oakland residents.
Students interested in forming a
Tenants Union are requested to
turn in their names, addresses
and telephone numbers at either,
the SG Office, 305 Student Union,
or at the Towers Housing Office.

Klavonic remarked that “Rent
money could be paid to a central
bank account and held in escrow.
a condition which means that
technically the rent is paid and the
landlord cannot evict the tenant.
However. the landlord could not
legally receive the money, forcing
him to make necessary repairs.”

Additionally, working with the
Board of Health in reporting un-
sanitary conditions and sightings
of rats, roaches, and the various
other vermin which dwell in Oak-
land apartments would force the
landlords to conform to Federal
standards.

“The biggest problem right
now,” stated Klavonic, “is col-
lecting enough data on conditions
in Oakland to build up a case,
which the SG Legal Awareness
Committee is planning for early
next year an unfair housing prac-

tices, discriminatory treatment, °

and substandard conditions for
living.”

Forbes further noted that the
profits from the refrigerators is
going to be used for the dedica-
tion of Litchfield Towers. This al-
lotment comes to $1,500, and no
one is quite sure how this money
will be used for the ceremony. -

MDC is also, according to
Forbes, “always sticking their
noses where" they don't belong. A
couple of years ago, when there
was conflict on campus over
ROTC,’MDC passed a resolution
that ROTC should be continued
and be worth one credit. This was
a curriculum matter and of no
concern of the Council.

“Now,” he continued, “they
have become involved in the con-
troversy over the new SG Consti-

tution.”

” MDC along with AWS, is taking
credit for the passage of the 24-
hour open houses. Forbes noted
that “they had no part in’ the pass-
age of this policy. It was passed
by a referendum presented to the
students. MDC did have a part in
presenting it to the students, but
they had nothing to do with its
passage.”

The purpose of the petition,
Forbes stated, is to have the Coun-
cil’s existence presented in a ref-
erendum to the students. “If the
majority of the students want it
to continue, it should. If they _don’t
want it, it should be abolished.
Nothing would be lost if it were,
since it really doesn’t do anything.
The job of MDC could be better
done by referendums of the peo-
ple in the Towers.”

Forbes stated that when he was
circulating the petition in the Tow-
ers, “most people had never
heard of MDC. When I talked to
them about it. it was the first time
they had ever heard of the Coun-
cil. Those who knew of it were en»
thusiastic about signing the peti-
tion."

Forbes concluded by saying.
“I'm of the opinion that if an or-
ganization doesn‘t do anything.
it should be abolished."

In their home finale. Saturday.
before 21.000 rain-soaked fans at
Pitt Stadium. the Panthers
stumbled to their fourth loss of
the 1970 season at the hands of
the Eagles of Boston College.
21-6.

The Panthers converted an
early Eagle miscue. a fumble
on a wide pitch from quarter-

' back Frank ‘Red’ Harris to Fred

Willis. into a touchdown. Min-
utes later B.C. posted their first
score of the afternoon. and from
then on the Cats had to play
catch-up football. 4’

The Eagles cashed in twice
at the end of the first half to
beef their lead up to 21-6. The

‘Panthers at the same time couldn‘t

penetrate the B.C. defense. and it
wasn't until early in the fourth
quarter ‘that they even entered
enemy territory.

“We were, to put it midly,”
Coach Carl DePasqua said,

“very sluggish and very poor.
They’re an extremely good foot-
ball team.”

   

Park. Pa. promises to be snarl-t
ing next week.

The Panther should be dis-
appointed because he got four
early successes while he was just
starting to get the knack of the
game this year. He didn't look
like a gazelle. but people be-
gan to notice him.

And now he’s losing an au-
dience because of the last three
weeks. While things were going
well he went on television twice,
and his confrontation with the
Nittany Lion was being consider-
ed for the magic screen.

That may be gone now. But
perhaps not. Watching the two
Cats go at it should be interest-
ing. But the Panther won't get
the most of the attention. His
offensive game. which never
really substaintiated itself. fell
flat against the Eagle. though
his defense continued to do what
its supposed to — d despite so
many bumps and bruises.

The man who has control
over the Panther. Carl DePas-
que. didn't really want to talk
about the Panthers year after
Saturdays succombing to the
Eagle. .

“I’d rather not comment on
the season for now,” he said,
while viewing the statistics that
showed how the Panther’s offense
had let him down. “Because
we’ve seen many teams, many
players this year. That makes it
difficult.”

Now. its also difficult to say
that the Panther is back.

After the Panthers‘ initial scor-
ing drive. Boston College to-
tally dominated the contest. They
moved the ball downfield flaw-
lessly scoring ‘on a two-yard
sweep by Fred Wilis. Their sec-

ond scoring drive was stopped

when Willis committed his
second fumble of the after-
noon.

The Eagles roared again late
in the second quarter. with nin-e
yard sweep by Willis capping
an 89-yard scoring drive that
took thirteen plays. Four minutes
later. and with only three sec-
onds left in the half. Willis
flagged in one of Harris’ four
completions for a 21-yard touch-
down.

Both defenses knuckled down
in the second half. and neither
team was able to put any points
on the scoreboard. The Pitt de-
fense especially rose to the oc-
casion in the final thirty min-
utes. holding B.C. on many
threats.

The first half saw the Eagles
roll up 205 yards on the ground
with Willis and Comella split-

\ting them up. almost evenly.

Red Harris, one of the nation’s
top passers only completed four
out of twelve passes for 51
yards and one touchdown. But

the Panthers’ problem was not ‘

stopping Boston College.

After their first and
touchdown. the Panther offense
sputtered. The Cats were strand-
ed in their own teeritory ten
times in a row. Joe Spicko was
forced to punt seven times.

Four interceptions were picked -

off by the Eagles. thwarting
Panther drives. B. C. also re-
covered two Pitt fumbles. the
second a highly—disputed call in
which Dave Havern appeared to
be in the process of passing
when tackled. The ball was jarred
loose and Boston College recover-
ed. stopping one of the Panther
fourth quarter touchdown drives.

only 

   

Rotating his two quarterbacks
for the entire first half, De-
Pasqua complained of poor field
position. Toward the end of the
second quarter, John Hogan was
tackled after throwing incomplete
to Joel Klimek. When he got to
the sidelines he reported that the
elbow that has been bothering him
all season was again giving him
trouble. The bone chips that
were diagnosed earlier in the sea-
son kept Hogan out the entire
second half, as the Parithers
floundered for running room.

Dave Havern. indicated the
tremendous frustration that
plagued Pitt all afternoon when
he grabbed the towel that hung
from center Bob Kuziel's belt.
after lining up behind the center.
and threw it down along the
line of scrimmage late in the
game Havern then proceeded to
have one of the three. end—zone
bound interceptions that he threw
in the fourth quarter.

"We did a lot of foolish things.“
said DePasqua. “that created the
problems we had.“

In the other dressing room
Coach Joe Yukika of B.C. talked
about his team. “They played
a solid. all—around footgall game.
I couldn‘t ask any more of this
football team."

Tough

IC4A’s

by MARTY HELLMAN

This ‘afternoon at Van Cortlandt Park in New York City. Coach
.lim Banners experiment with this years cross country team will be

put to its test. '

All season. Banner has been giving the barriers a chance to train
slowly in hopes of getting the runners in top shape for todays IC4A

championship race.

Thirty-six teams are entered in
the eastern title meet in the Uni-
versity Division. with a maxi-
mum of seven men from each
squad permitted to compete.

Banner feels that Pitt is one
of nine teams which have a
chance of winning, with Vill-
anov University heading the
list. Other strong clubs are Cor-
nell, Harvard, Manhattan.
Northeaster, Pennsylvania, Penn
State and William and Mary.

The battle for top individual
honors should be even tougher
than the team contest. Accord-
ing to Banner. there are several
runners who could take first
place.

Jerry Richey. Pitts best runner
for the past three years is among

 

the group. of prime candidates.

Banner feels that. "Chris Mason
of Villanova and How Michael of
William and Mary will be two
of the best runners.“

Villanova cross country coach
Jack Pyrah added to the list of
potential victors. “Donal Walsh,
our top man, has to be considered
along with Greg Fredericks of
Penn State, and John Ander-
son of Cornell,” he explained.

Along with Riirliey. Banner is
taking seniors Mick Schurko.

Victory Makes NCAA

by VINCE DiNARDO

The Pitt soccer team ended the
season Friday with a tight 2-1 loss
to Penn State. The Pitt loss gave
eastern selectors a 2-0 record in
their decisions concerning Pitt
teams. The NCAA tourney com-
mittee chose Penn State to the
post—season playoff tournament
before this weeks Pitt-PSU game.
They made a similar choice with
the Pitt baseball team last sum-
mer.

On both occasions the Penn
State teams have won the games.

Denying that the Penn State
name has some sort of magic at-
tached to it, Herb Schmidt, the
State soccer coach, merely said
that his team deserved it.

“We didn’t play as well as we
can,” he noted, “but we played a
good game, good enough to win.”

Penn State opened as if there
was going to be no question as to
which team should go to the post-
season tourney. They jumped on a
"sluggish” Pitt team for two
quick first period goals. With the
game just ten minutes old, Rick
Allen pushed a shot past Pitt
goalie Kerry Krause.

Six minutes later. Penn State
struck again.

On a corner kick, State fullback
Tom Keehan, a Lion defensive
star, headed the ball for the sec-
ond score.

“We looked slugish and sloppy
in the first half,” said dejected
Pitt coach Leo Bemis.

Near the end of the half and in
the beginning of the second half
the booters found it hard to main-
tain control of the ball. They lost
control of the ball with bad throw
ins and errant kicks. Thirteen off-
side calls didn’t help them either.

But Ali Rdissi helped turn the
team around. On a pass from Len-
ny Raffa, at 9:34 in the third per-
iod, Rdissi shot past the Lion
goalie, and Pitt came to life. Sud-
denly Penn State was having trou-
ble handling the ball. The second
half was in Pitt’s control.

The rest of the game was one of
near misses. “They have nothing
to be ashamed of,” Schmidt said.

    

 

In Memorium

The Marshall University
football team was tragical-
ly wiped out by an airplane
accident over the weekend.
[Besides the natural sorrow
of death, anyone who is
close to a team that travels
often was hit hard by the
tragedy, as well as the sim-
ilar fate of the Wichita State
players a few weeks ago. '

  
  

  
  
    
   
   
   
   
     
  

The Pitt News wishes to
send its sympathy to the
families and friends of
those who lost their lives in
.both air mishaps.

 
        
 

  
 

 
 

 

Committee Look Good

The game got heated at times.
Gus Theofilos was upset at an er-
rant State hand which struck him
across the face. He was about to
throw an errant hand of his own
when the official stepped in.

Schmidt would have definently
have liked a rout. A 2-1 victory
doesn’t look as good as he would
have liked.

Schmidt also hinted that Pitt
should havsbeen chosen before
University of Penn to the playoffs.
“Penn has a 7-3 record.” he
said, “but I don’t think the played
the teams Pitt did.” The booters
finished with a 8-4 record.

“I hope Penn States goes all the
way and wins the tournament,”
said Leo Bemis. “That might
show them (the committee) how
good we really are.”

Two years ago Pitt soccer
coach Leo Bemis wasn‘t having a
very good season. Besides losing
games, his team was losing play-
ers.

Eight players dropped off the
squad in 1968 for “personal rea-
sons” before the season had been
completed and a letter was sent to
The Pitt News that asked for Be-
mis’ firing.

It was thought that the letter

was sent by one of the players who

quit the team. That sounded like

the logical explanation of identity
since few other people on campus
care about the fate of the soccer
team.

There wasn’t much chance of
the soccer coach being fired
though. A boot coach doesn’t have
to win as often as a football coach;
he just has to put effort into his
assignment. And besides, Leo Be-
mis brought soccer to Pitt some
13 years before the bad season.

Pitt has never called anyone their
soccer coach.

No one else has been called the
Pitt soccer coach yet. Bemis still
pilots the booters, and this year
his squad has recently completed
the best Pitt soccer season in five
years with eight wins and four
losses.

“We have more soccer play-

ers,” Bemis said, thinking about
1968, after his team lost to tour-
ney-bound Penn State last Friday
afternoon. “Two years ago we
just didn’t have fellas who could

play that well. We couldn’t play a‘

complete game.”

A few players from the 1968
team were around for Friday's
final.

Randy Dry and Dave (“DI")
DiEmidio,i who were switched
from their positions of two years
ago, were the only players in ac-

was the soccermen’s manager, 

sitting out a year of lost eligibil-
ity because he transferred from
Slippery Rock.

For Kurth the 1968 Soccer
season was quite frustrating,

since he could only sit along the V;

sidelines.

But the losing bothered those on
the roster more, as the quitting
indicated. This year, with the

squad winning, there certainly 

wasn’t any mass quitting.

But one player did leave. Lou I 

Vida, a member of the 1968
became one of the co-captains the
next year, dropped off‘ the squad
after seeing limited action this
fall.

But Bemis doesn’t criticize his
former captain for quitting. In T.
fact, he doesn’t have harsh words

for the eight guys from 1968 either“) , _

“I look at it this way,” he says.
“You always know some guys will
want to quit. I’ll bet the football
players who don’t play would quit
if they didn't have the full scholar-
ships."

 Black Athlete At‘ Pitt 

Black Athlete Recognition Day

, by ED CONLEY _
Ceremonies.

Sports Editor
A The festivities, which included
the tapping of gridder Lloyd Wes-
ton as Black Athlete of the Year.
were a part of the Black Week
program sponsored by the campus
Black Action Society organization.

Chesterjs Black. In fact, he was
the only ‘Black on the Pitt football
team in 1966-that‘s just four
years ago.

Now there are 45 Black athletes
at Pitt, which has to be considered
an improvement, but Chester
wanted to remind the Blacks that
they shouldn’t think the way
Blacks (“then known as Ne-
groes") have previously thought
about their positions on a team,
their positions in life.

“You would say I am an athlete
and a champion. -1 am an All-
American boy for my people-in
that order,” he related to his au-
dience, which was practically all-
Black. ‘‘That’s what the White
man wanted to hear.”

L “Nolain’t.
_ ’ ,Nalain’t no more.
,.  loin’tgoihg that way no more.
9:‘  .}~l'm not no Uncle Tom.
My, head ain't hanging low no more.,
’Cause'l found out I'm Block
  And l-ain't going that way no more.”
 , Dewey Chester, a Pitt halfback
1 in’the mid-1960’s, borrowed those
,  words ‘from a 12-year-old black
  yough to convey his feelings about
the Black athlete at his Alma Ma-
" ter in aspeech at last Friday‘s

 

"Lift your voice’-and say I ain’t
going that way. Say I am a man, I
am for my people. and I am Black
—in that order."

A Black man presently involved
in the Pitt footbacl program spoke
prior to Chester at the noontime
affair, but he gave the impres-
sion that Pitt’s Black athetes are

what Dewey Chester would like to
see. I
Warren SiPP. an assistant grid
coach pictured the “brothers”:
“The Black athlete on campus is
a different individual. On the field
he’s still the tiger his ability al-

lows him to be. Off the field the .

Black athlete hasn’t always been
the vocal one—the one to speak up
for his rights with publicity, schol-
arships, pro contracts. Now, I_
feel, he is speaking up.”

The only other Black coach at
Pitt, track assistant Dennis John-
son, agreed that he likes the kind
of man Pitt’s typical Black ath-

lete is, but he emphasized that all ‘
Black athletes are important to
him.

“I love the Black brothers on I

our football team,” he said. “But
in the UCLA game every time a

brother on the UCLA team got

theiball I wanted him to really run
that hall.”

The Black gridders I present
starred at one another after that
comment. Though they must con-
sider their Blackness important,
they are taught on the football field

that a team has to play together—-

and certainly not cheer for the op-

position.

Nabb Attempts To Grab

Pvt. “Buzz” Naab phoned in his
yogis selections early this week,
as the famed Yogis enter the final
week of competition.

With his selections from Fort
Knox, Ky, “Buzz” added a state-
ment which read: “I’m gonna

grab the gold in the last week,

everyone else is worried about

Play Beats
Pi Lams

by STEVE WILLIAMS

Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji- romp-
ed to their division title in the fra-
ternity league by soundly drub-
bing Phi Lambda Phi (Phi Lam).
41-7, Sunday. 9

Phi Lam received more than a
defeat. Three of their players re-
ceived injuries which knocked
them out of the game. 0

Early in the first half with the
score still close, Jim Davis was
hit while receiving a pass which
resulted in a severely stoved
hand. He was unable to play any
more after that.

With nearly three minutes left
in the game and Fiji leading 35-0,
Vince Corsi hit Jon Rutenberg on
the left side of his face. Ruten-
berg immediately collapsed in
pain and laid on the filed coughing
and sputterning blood from his
mouth and nose. After about five
minutes he was carried off the
field and assisted to a hospital for
medical attention. Incidently, a
personal foul was charged to Cor-
S1.

»Shortly thereafter, Rich Heft
staggered 'off- the field with blood
flowing from his nose, after the
final Fiji touchdown. No penalty
was called on this play.

Meanwhile, Fiji was running up
41 points.

Jim Ayres, whose rifle arm and
shifty running set up every Fiji
score, led his team down the field
at will.

The combination, - Ayres to
Wayne Pile resulted in three
quick touchdowns. These touch-
downs varied in length; 30 yards,
15 yards, and five yards. Paul
Kalinsky and Ayres followed two
of these touchdowns with conver-
sion runs both good for two points.

In order that Fiji could score
these three touchdowns so quick-
ly, Van Krause intercepted a Pi
Lam pass on the three yard line,
preventing the Pi Lam score. He
also led the defense which was
highlighted by the defensive
charge of Bill Mamakos and Vince
Corsi, who are affectionately call- 0
ed by their brothers as “The Ter-
rible Twosome.”

Ayres continued his one man
circus act, completing a 40-yard
bomb to Bill Hull on a picture
play. The score was now 28-0.

Ayres followed this picture play
with his solo act down the side-
lines. running to the corner of the
end zone-. The old combination,
Ayres to Pile clicked again for the
extra point attempt. raising the
score to 35-0.

Rutenberg was hurt following
this touchdown. ‘

His injury and the ensuing Pi
Lam touchdown didn’t impair the
Fiji lust for points.

Pi Lam’s touchdown was a 15

l yard pass from Rich Josselsam to

Bob Sterns. John Kates caught
the conversion pass in the corner
of the end zone for their last mo-
ment of glory.

Ayres took the first snap from
center and completed his second

said, “ and that’s a pretty good
criteria of how strong they are."

The Wildcats have a perfect
6-0 record this fall. Pyrah stated
that, “No team has come really
close to us so far.”

A doubtful starter for Villan-
ova is Marty Liquori. who is
bothered by a score leg. Liquori.
an All-American in track and
cross country in past years. won
the firstrace this season. and
has not been victorious since. .

The only common opponent of
Pitt and Villanova this year was
Penn State. The Wildcats smashed
the Lions 20-35 in a dual meet.
while the harriers beat them 24-
49 in the “Big Four“ meet.

The courst at Van Courtlandt
Park may prove to be very instru-
mental in the outcome of the
race.

One of the toughest parts of
the five mile course comes at a
point one half mile from the
start. There is a direct left turn
where all of the runners must
clear without getting boxed in.

"It‘s really a tough course,“
}Banner stated. “and a team
{must be lucky as well as good

-(to win on it."

The Fiji lust for points is ex-

As Allan Ginsburg. a Pi Lam

in an intramural football game
played on Pitt Stadiums soggy
As roturf. As a result. Kappa
Sig. Theta Chi and Delta Phi are
tied with 4-1 records. Two play-
off games will be necessary to
determine the division winner.

Ed Ticken started Theta Chi's
first scoring drive. rambling to the
Kappa Sig twenty-five yard line
with an interception. After com-
pleting a flare-out pass to Doug
Hodzak, Theta Chi quarterback
Warren Nystrom threw a 15 yard
scoring aerial to split end Roc-

With only seconds remaining
in the first half, Kappa Sig
knotted the score at 6-6. John
Burby caught Dave Dworsky's
thirty yard pass for a first down
on the Theta Chi twenty. Three
plays later,» Dworsky swept
around right end for a touch-
down.

Kappa Sig came out roaring-

in the second half. On the first
play, the Dworsky-Burby combo
clicked again, this time on a 45
yard scoring aerial. With Theat
Chi deep in their own territory,
John Hartley intercepted Nys-
trom’s look-in pass, giving the
Kappa Sigs a first down only
two yards from the Theta Chi
goal line. Dworsky scored the
clincher seconds later, as he hit
