Rea Steps Down
After I 1 Years

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News StaffWriter

Pitt has undergone significant changes, both

. financially and socially, this past decade, ac-

cording to William H. Rea, recently retired
chairman of the Board of Trustees.

“It’s been a very dynamic period,” said Rea,
who has served as a trusteesince 1950. “I think
this past period has seen the greatest change of
American education in our history,

“It’s been
a time of great
expansion for
the Univer-
sity,” he con-
tinued. “We
have gone
through social
and" racial
changes.”

Rea resigned
the position he
held for 11

WILLIAM REA
years at Tuesday’s Board meeting in Johns-
town. He will remain active as a trustee.

Rea expressed high praise for Chancellor
Posvar, who became Pitt’s head man in
1967—the same year Rea assumed the position
of chairman. '

Rea referred to Pitt’s financial problem in
the mid-l960’s as a “more serious problem”
than today’s budget troubles. '

“It (bankruptcy) was an instant problem,”
he said. “You had to have an instant solution.
It was pretty much of a disaster.” ‘

Rea ,said he is pleased with student attitudes
today as compared to campus unrest in the
60’s. '

“There is a whole different attitude among
students,” he said. “They are much more
serious about their education. The whole at-
titude is one of cooperation. The student in-

t est has made a difference.”

"Rea also said alumni attitudes toward the
University have also changed for the better. He
said gifts to the University exceeded $1 million
last year, while gifts in the 60’s amounted to
approximately $200,000 annually.

“This has been a very encouraging sign,”

PHILADELPHIA-—Pennsylvania
voters gave politicians a loud and
clear message in Tuesday’s
primary: they want new and
independent candidates from
outside Philadelphia who promise
cheaper government free of
corruption.

And that’s exactly what they got,
clearly demonstrating for the third
straight election that the solid
political muscle is in the west.
especially when a.westerner is on
the ballot.

Two Pittsburghers, each of
whom once served as deputy
United States attorney general, will
battle in November to succeed
Democratic Governor Shapp whose

And that’s the rhetoric the voters
will be hearing through the
summer and fall.

The gubernatorial nominees are
former Democratic Pittsburgh
Mayor Peter Flaherty and
Republican Richard Thomburgh,
United States Attorney in western
Pennsylvania before President
Ford made him No. 2 man in the
Justice Department. Flaherty was
named to succeed Thornburgh by
President Carter.

Pitt News Staff Writer

JOHNSTOWN, Pa.—Tuition
went up and chairman William Rea
stepped down Tuesday when Pitt’s
trustees assembled here for their
annual meeting.

Each event sparked discussion;
an at-times lively 45-minute debate
preceded the board’s overwhelming
acceptance of an anticipated $210.7
million budget and its attendant
across-the-board tuition increase,
and a series of tributes, including a

retirement from a position he held
for 11 years. ,

Chancellor Posvar told Senate
Council last week that the trustees
would not consider a budget at the
annual meeting because of un-
certainties connected to Pitt’s
expected state appropriation, but
Roger Ahlbrandt, who later took
Rea’s seat as chairman, presented
his colleagues with a budget that
assumed a state appropriation of
$63.1 million, the funding level
recently approved by the Penn-
sylvania House.

“This is a realistic budget—the
best budget attainable under the
circumstances,” Ahlbrandt said of
a ﬁnancial package that raised
full-time ’ in-state undergraduate
tuition $25 per term to $730 (the
ﬁgure was $605 a year ago.)

His presentation spurred a
discussion in which trustees Alfred
Lawson, a long-time opponent of
tuition hikes, and State Senator W.
Lewis Coppersmith, voting against
a tuition increase for the first time,
argued against the proposed
increases. ,

“I have, in the past, agreed that
the University had no alternative
but to increase tuition,” Copper-
smith told the trustees. “But
tuition is getting out of hand, and I
think that in view of the
uncertainties (with state funding)
we could temporize the‘ increase.

’I’m suggesting a one-year tempor-

izing.’.’

Judge Ruggero Aldisert, who has
perhaps been the most forceful foe
of increased tuition during his years..-
as a trustee, was absent from the
meeting but Lawson, an attorney

Nixon’s re-election in 1972. Neither
ever ran for political ofﬁce before.

All four rolled to easy victories
because of huge margins in
Allegheny, Westmoreland, Wash-
ington, Cambria, Beaver,
Indiana, Fayette and other western
counties.

In 1976 Republican John Heinz
of Pittsburgh won the United States
Senate seat over Philadelphia
Democrat William Green by
collecting over 70 percent of the
vote in the west.

Last year Allegheny County
Judge Rolf Larsen upset the
Democratic organization choice for
state Supreme Court in the primary

 and then routed the Republican
‘Governor who , apposed  I "

 ‘in the? general election.

Raise Tuition Again
In-State Undergrads Will Pay-

Per Term

ROGER All-ILBRANDT

appointed to the board by Governor
Shapp, carried the hold-tuition
torch.

“This is totally unacceptable,”
Lawson said of the budget;
“I see Pitt becoming a second-rate
institution because of a lack of funds
and because of an inability to attract
a quality student body.

“Tuition was $1,320 just a few
months ago, and now it’ll be $1,460

in the fall,” Lawson ‘continued.’

“The student body is going to be
drawn from students who are
rejected elsewhere.

“The state has to be pressured,”
Lawson concluded, adding that Pitt
might improve its chance at
increased state fundng by refusing
to raise tuition. Had tuition not
been increased at the proposed
levels, -Pitt’s expected receipts
would have fallen some $1.5
million.”

“This is an austere budget,”
argued Jack Freeman, vice chancel-
lor for business and planning.
“It is tenuously balanced given the
tuition increase.

“That decision (not to increase
tuition) would place‘ us-—-inevit-
ably——in a deficit situation,”
Freeman said. "

Several trustees argued against
the idea of writing a deﬁcit into
Pitt’s operating budget.

“It would be an unfortunate
procedure,” said Rea, who remind-
ed the board of Pitt’s ﬁnancial

position in the late 1960’s after a

Thornburgh, Flaherty Emerge As Victors

Both of the losers were Phila-
delphia judges. .
Flaherty, a party maverick who
prefers a no-strings-(attached
status, is the only major winner
with previous statewide exper-
ience. In 1974, after a hard-fought
primary battle with consumer
advocate Herbert Denenberg, he
fell short in trying to end
Republican Richard Schweiker’s

career in the United States Senate. ..

Thomburgh’s only other political
race was a losing effort for
Congress in 1966, before he
became popular , as a Federal
prosecutor who sent crooked
politicians to jail.

unmercifully’ in the primary—
Thornburgh constantly called it
“seven years of shame” while
Flaherty repeated over and over
“the state cries out for a new
manager.”

Lieutenant Governor Kline’s
candidacy couldn't unshackle this

Shapp albatross and it destroyed
him.

Thornburgh believes it also will
drag Flaherty down in November.

“I just don’t think any Democrat,
including Mr. Flaherty, can extend
a believable program as a member
of a party that brought this state to
the condition it’s in,” he said. “I
think people want a clean slate.”

Rea Retires As Board

Of Trustees Chairman

(Continued from Page 1)
Rea said. He added that while
interest in athletics has remained
high, the alumni have also begun to
“rally around the academic in-
terests of the University.”

At his last meeting as chairman

’ Rea presided over a long debate by

trustees before a $25 tuition hike for
next fall was passed. Rea said
annual tuition hikes could be
expected at future board meetings.

“It will certainly occur as long as
inﬂation continues,” he said. “If
the Legislature would realize
inﬂation and the need to increase
subsidies at Pitt, it would not be
necessary.”

Rea noted that one encouraging
sign was the four percent increase
in state appropriations for Pitt
proposed by the House after two
years of no aid increases.

Posvar warned at last week’s
Senate Council meeting that the
proposed increase could be cut as
the state budget deadline ap-
proaches.

Rea expressed hope that the full
increase would be enacted.

“I have my ﬁngers crossed,” he
said.

 

A REGULAR CHECKUP

“Cancer is a serious threat to men

City of NewYork. “Call your Ameri-
can Cancer Society for more infor-
mation about cancer.”

Trustees Approve Tuition Hike

(Continued from Page 1)

string of deﬁcit-riddled budgets left
Pitt close to bankruptcy and at the
mercy ofthe state. “We are playing
with a time bomb here. We don’t
want to put the University into
debt.”

Posvar, who again voiced his
“philosophical” objections to in-
creases. Instead, he said it might be
more prudent (“though there’s not
much of a chance") to consider to
tuition “rollback” in the future

should additional revenue be
secured.

The coming fall term will be the
fourth consecutive for which tuition
has been increased. The $25
increase made official Tuesday will
be added to a $50 increase that went
into effect this spring.

Medical school tuition was raised
$1.000 for the third consecutive
year; Pennsylvania residents, who
paid $1,500 in 1974 for medical
instruction, will pay $5,000 next

year.

Most other increases followed the
general lines of the undergraduate
tuition increase.

In other business, Posvar
announced that freshmen would be
required to attend this summer’s
orientation program (June 24-27);
repeated the University’s position
that “unionization of our staff is
unnecessary;” and reported that
he and several other Pittsburghers
would tour China next month.

 x L — "72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Another Increase

No comment can express the incredible frustration felt in the face
of the tuition hike passed by the Board of Trustees Tuesday.
This latest in a series of increases adds $25 per term to un-
dergraduate fees and means Pitt students from Pennsylvania can
expect the line marked “tuition” on their invoice to read $730 this
fall.

After a $50 per term hike in February and a $50 increase last fall,
we wonderwhen the spiraling cost of Pitt education will finally sub-
side. One trustee’s observation——“It (tuition increases) will cer-
tainly occur as long as inﬂation continues.”—makes future chan-
ces for a stabilized tuition look very dim.

There are a wide array of scapegoats we can blame for the
problem: state legislators unwilling to raise taxes and adequately
fund the University; Pitt administrators unable to milk more
money from Harrisburg; a general public unsympathetic about the
needs of Pennsylvania’s higher education system; and a generally
apathetic student body uninterested in seriously ﬁghting for
enough appropriations to prevent fee increases.

We know. Those people have been castigated again and again by
us. Repeating the trite tirades against our representatives and the
exhortations encouraging students to make themselves heard in
Harrisburg seem an exercise in futility at this time. . \

However, we are concerned about the nonchalant attitude per-
vading the Board of Trustees. The majority of them seems to feel
hikes are inevitable and give little thought to alternatives. The
Chancellor’s sudden decision only a few days before the meeting to
push the Budget-Audit Committee to consider the budget repre-

Instead, Pitt officials can just borrow more

If /the Federal

Government cannot allow New York City to collapse, the Penn-

Opinion

It is very disillusioning to have to
ﬁght for equal rights in the ‘ ‘land of
the free.” Every minority in this
country, at one time or another, has
been discriminated against and
made the butt of bigoted jokes.
Through protective legislation we
have been able to overcome some
bigotry, though much of it lingers.

The latest attack on human rights
comes from Anita Bryant and her
anti-homosexual crusaders.
Sprouting lies and spreading
hysteria, she has been all too

effective in getting her message
across. But her message must be
examined closely. -

Does any one person have the
right to deny others human dignity,
employment and housing on the
basis of distorted religious beliefs.
I’m sure most people agree she is
entitled to her opinion, but when
her opinion leads to the destruction
of innocent people’s lives, she must
be stopped.

This issue goes beyond homo-

sexual rights. When an attack is
made on one group of people, all of
our rights are endangered. Let us
live up to the constitutional
amendment that guarantees “life,
liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness’ ’ and join forces to ﬁght for the
human rights to which every citizen
of this country is entitled. If
homosexual rights are suppressed,
who will be next?

Homefront Ignored Part of Budget Crisis Battle K

By JOHN HESS

For a long time now, students
have been hearing about a ‘ ‘budget
crisis” at Pitt. It’s been a serial on
the cover of The Pitt News, but it’s
been a rather bad soap opera.

Why? Because it hasn’t been able
to hold the attention of students who

have known all along that they
would get ripped off again,
regardless of the story’s twists and
turns. Of course, our suspicions
came true and we are now attending
the third most expensive state-
related school in the country.

Why is Pitt so poor? It is run by
heads of big banks and corporations
that certainly have enough money.
University officials blame Harris-
burg. The latest budget submitted
by Governor Shapp hit especially
hard on education and welfare. It
keeps universities and state col-
leges at their present spending
levels and allows no salary increase
for state workers.

The bite on education was

justiﬁed by saying the birth rate is
declining and fewer students are
attending public schools. That
seems a bit ridiculous. Statistics
show that in the last ﬁve years, the
number of students whose families
make between $10-15,000 per year
(adjusted for inﬂation) has gone
down almost 20 percent at Pitt. That
isn’t because there are less people,
but because they can’t afford to pay
the high education costs. E

In the fall of 1977, while waiting
for state appropriations to come
through, Pitt borrowed $18 million.
When the Pitt bureaucrats saw that
the requested increase in appro-
priations was not given in the state
budget, they let their natural
instincts take command. They
began cutting back and taking
students for all the money they
could.

On Tuesday, February 14, the
Board of Trustees voted on a tuition
increase. Only one trustee voted
against it. Now, tuition at Pitt has
risen $50 per term for undergradu-

ates and $55 per term for graduate
students. Chancellor Posvar and
Board Chairman William Rea said it
could be raised again in the fall.

In addition to raising tuition, Jack
Freeman, vice-chancellor for plan-
ning and budget, said: “We cut $1
million in physical plant, $600,000
out of provisions, repairs and
rennovations; we looked at job
attrition...”

Also, Posvar has set a 10 percent
reduction in power usage as a
long-range goal for the University.
To students, that means using.
poorly kept facilities and the early
closing of campus buildings.

The tuition increase is going to be
painful to many students who are
going to have to scratch and save to
return to Pitt. The Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agen-
cy says students requested to
borrow 20 percent more money this
year than last. On top of everything
else, welfare benefits have been
taken away from full-time students.

While the economic crunch is
coming down hardest on working-
class and minority students, the
University has turned its attention
to attracting prestigious students
and faculty, hoping to draw more
research money to the school and
gaining Pitt a high-brow reputation.
It aspires to become a “Harvard on
the Mon.”

-The emphasis at Pitt is not
education, but research. The only
improvement ofquality education is
taking place in the Honors Program,
which affects only a small number of
students; many smaller programs
and departments, in the meantime,
are suffering from a lack of funds
and are liable to be cut altogether.

Even one trustee, A. E. Lawson,
was forced to admit: “lncreasing

_‘t_u'it_ion: eventually becomes self-

defeating and suicidal. Statistics
show that blacks, ﬁrst-generation
college students and working class
students go down in numbers each
time tuition goes up.”

However, what is Lawson so
worried about? What is suicidal
about it? Pittsburgh is noted for its
steel industry, but it is well known
that Pitt has become the largest
employer in the area. It both
produces and employs many
white-collar workers.

Pitt resembles a corporation and
generates much revenue for the
state. And it is tied greatly into the
community. The majority of stu-
dents are commuters and 75 percent
work part time. It is the job of a
university under capitalism to soak
up much of the would-be unem-
ployed and trainthem to function in
ways that best serve the system.
Whenever Pitt starts turning away
working-class students, it is simul-
taneously leaving them unem-
ployed, failing to train them and
breaking its ties with the com-
munity on which it is dependent.

As its enrollment drops, it needs
less of a staff, employs less people
and becomes less of an economic
and social force and even more of a
burden to the community. No
wonder Lawson is worried. It seems
that to stabilize Pitt could mean to
unstabilize an already shaky
economic situation in the area.

Throughout this whole affair,
Posvar has been pointing an angry
ﬁnger at Harrisburg while doing a
political tapdance that is designed
to make Pitt students think highly of
their beloved chancellor. However,
his disregard for the students’
interests is already obvious.

It is funny that Student Govern-
ment has been dancing right along
with Posvar.» doing a strange

L a full-s_ca.l_e,.ﬁre.

version of the Hustle. Our student
“leader,” Josh Baylson, said, “I
fear we, as students, are being used
in a game of politics.”

How profound! Why is it that
Student Government wants to score
the most touchdowns in this game?
It has adopted the strategy of
running and crying to the State
Legislature, sending buses of‘
students to lobby in Harrisburg and
getting nowhere.

They go to shake hands with the

big-wheels while our money going‘ M‘
down the drain. They are asking}; W

mugger to return a stolen wallet.
While they keep our attention
focused across the state, we
continue to get mugged at
home—more cutbacks and tuition
hikes.

The state, which has not only run
out of money for universities but has
also, at times, been unable to pay
welfare recipients and its own
employees, isn’t going to come up
with any more money for Pitt unless
it is taken from the hides of
Pennsylvania taxpayers. It is goin, ‘
to force Pennsylvanians to pay one‘
way or the other. The capitalist
system is based on ripping the
public off, and every time the
system gets in trouble, the solution
seems to be to rob the people even
more.

The University’s policy is to cut

, back education and cut students out

of it at the same time. Students will
continue to be forgotten, and tuition
will continue to rise as regularly as
the changing of the seasons as long
as the fight against tuition hikes is
not right here on the Pitt campus.
Students would be victorious only if
both state and Pitt bureaucrats were
to see the situation here so hot that
another tuition increase could spark

Enigma To Staid Republicans

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—Strait-laced
Pennsylvania Republicans may not
be entirely comfortable with the
Republican nominee for Lieutenant
Governor—William Scranton III.

For one thing, Scranton, whose
famous father was governor from
1962 to 1966, endorsed Democrat
George McGovern in 1972.

For another, he was an inter-
national leader in the transcenden-
tal meditation (TM) movement.
having met his wife, Coral, while
working under a maharishi in
Switzerland.

There’s no doubt the magic of the
Scranton name helped at the ballot
box. _

Some of his workers at the victory
party early yesterday were willing
to speculate that it attracted up to 50
percent of the vote.

“It (the name) certainly help-
ed,” Bill Scranton III admitted. But
the 30-year-old victor insisted that
he had hit the campaign trail hard
and had gotten his message,
bolstering the state’s ailing
economy, across to the voters.

His father, who ran for President

Kane Calls

By The Associated Press

HARRlSBURG——Pennsylvania
voters, who have prescribed open
elections to cure political ills in the
State Justice Department, are
using snake oil as a remedy, State
Attorney General Robert Kane said
yesterday.

“A panacea was created. The
people were told that if they do
this, by some magic they’re going
to get results,” Kane said the day
after voters decided by a margin of
nearly 5-1 to elect the state’s
highest Justice Department
ofﬁcial.

“I think the public was confront-
ed with the issue without it being
fully balanced in discussion.”

Kane’s own appointment in 1975
prompted criticism because of
scandals that occurred under his

ambassador to the United Nations,
hinted that he would be willing to
take an active role in the general
election campaign when his son and
Richard Thornburgh of Pittsburgh
take on Democrats Peter Flaherty
and Robert P. Casey.

Will the elder Scranton appear on
the campaign trail?

“That depends entirely on what
the state campaign wants and what
be (his son) wants,” the elder
statesman replied.

The younger Scranton graduated
from Yale in 1969 and has worked in
Republican politics for years, going
to county political dinners and
aiding with registration drives. But
he had never sought elective ofﬁce
before. '

His parents donated $10,000 to _

the campaign war chest, which
reached $150,000. Republican
bigwigs like Drew Lewis, former
Republican gubernatorial candi-
date, and ex-United States Trans-
portation Secretary William T.
Coleman, helped rustle up the

of revenue and because of his job
as Governor Shapp’s campaign
manager.

But the 47-year-old attorney
general discountedlthe theory that
the referendum was a plebiscite on
himself or the Shapp adminis-
tration.

“The public has been frustrated
and dubious about government
throughout the post-Watergate
period, so it took to the issue,” he
said.

The frustration appeared over-
whelming Tuesday. With 93
percent of the ballots counted, the
vote was 860,272 to 175,974 in
favor of an elected rather than an
appointed attorney general. The

Three years ago when he was an
international director of the TM
movement, Scranton helped con-
vince social workers to use the
ancient art of improving mind and
body in state-funded programs for
rehabilating ex-convicts, drug ad-
dicts and alcoholics.

He was working under the
direction of Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, a forever-smiling elﬁn monk
who gained notoriety when the
Beatles and Mia Farrow beat a path
to his ashram in India in 1966.

“Many people, when they hear
about TM for the ﬁrst time,think
it’s a way to escape from the world
when it’s actually a way to become
more dynamic and fruitful,"
Scranton said at the time.
“I taught my father to meditate in
the summer of 1973, and as a result

states that already elect their
attorneys general.

Voters also approved a second
constitutional amendment concern-
ing a technical change on how long
judicial appointments run. The
amendment would limit the
Governor’s authority to fill judicial
vacancies.

Resolution opponents like Kane
had argued that an elected attorney
general would inject politics into
the office.

Supporters of ‘the resolution
countered that Shapp’s appoint-
ment of Kane was already the
pinacle of political cronyism.

Kane, a campaign worker on
Shapp’s election team, was named
secretary of revenue when Shapp
took ofﬁce in 1971.

Convoy Rescues Americans in Zaire

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON——A civilian rescue operation plucked most of the
Americans from Zaire’s battle-scarred Shaba province yesterday,
and Pentagon sources said it was unlikely U.S. paratroopers would -
be sent to rescue the 11 persons still trapped there.

The rescue convoy was organized by Morrison-Knudson, a Boise,
Idaho ﬁrm which is building an electric transmission line from a dam
at Inga on the country's west coast to Kolwezi in the southeast.

Without encountering ﬁre, the convoy of trucks and helicopters
reached a compound eight miles from the rebel-held town of
State Department‘ spokesman
Hodding Carter reported in Washingotn. He said the convoy took 65
Morrison-Knudson employees‘ and dependents out by truck and
rescued another 12 by helicopter.

Police Discover Chaplin's Body

By The Associated Press

LAUSANNE, Switzerland—-The body of Charlie Chaplin, stolen

police have arrested the two alleged thieves, a Pole and a Bulgarian,

The two men were arrested Tuesday after allegedly calling police.. -
demanding a ransom for the return of the comedian’s remains,
said Examining Magistrate Jean-Daniel Tenthorey. R

He said the body was found near Villeneuve, a small town at the 
eastern tip of Lake Geneva,
Corsier-sur-Vevey, where Chaplin spent the last 25 years of his life
and where he was buried last Dec. 27. A.

Tenthorey said the body was recovered early yesterday morning. ‘ '7 f

Several ofﬁcials of the State

and convicted for involvement in
the smuggling of untaxed
cigarettes that took place during
Kane's tenure.

Kanequit that cabinet post _in
1974 to direct Shapp’s second
successful campaign and was
appointed attorney general after
that election.

“The over-simpliﬁcation is that
the attorney general does just what

Elected Attorney General ‘Snake Oil’ Solution

As soon as the primary results
are certiﬁed, the attorney general’s
post becomes open, meaning that
Kane is out of a job. Shapp has not
indicated whether he would
re-appoint Kane as an interim
attorney general or go with
someone else.

The interim appointee is to serve
until an attorney general is elected
under the new amendment in
November 1980.

It’s that election which will spark
political dealing in the attorney
general’s post, Kane argues.

“Two years from now. you're
going to see several lawyers seek
their party’s nomination for ofﬁce.

Somebody’s going to have to take a

stand and raise campaign money,”_

he said.

League Decisions--Commissioner,

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

T_he_decision to hire a full-time
commissioner and to return the
league tournament to Pittsburgh
highlighted the Eastern Eight’s
annual off-season meeting :in
Hershey Tuesday.

The league had to realign the
format of the tournament to return it
to the Civic Arena since the
Penguins had rights for the evening
of Saturday, March 3. The
ﬁrst-round tournament games will
be played on the home ﬂoors of the
four schools with the best league
records. The ﬁrst-place team will
play the eighth, the second will play
the seventh, and so on, on Tuesday,
Feb. 27; the_ winners move to the
Arena for semi-fmal games today,

with the ﬁnal being held on
Saturday afternoon.

‘ ‘I think the big breakthough was
the recommendation to establish a
league office and staff it, ” outgoing
Eastern Eight president Leland
Byrd of West Virginia told a
reporter. “It’s an indication of the
committment to be a
ﬁrst-class league. We’ve grown so
much we needed someone to handle
all the details.”

One of the primarv duties of the

new commissioner will be to
negotiate a television package for
the league; last year’s proposed
package was canceled at the last
minute by the network.

Rutgers Athletic.Director Fred
Gruninger succeeded Byrd as

league president; Penn State’s Ed

Czekaj was elected vice president
and Pitt Athletic Director Cas
Myslinski is the new secretary-
treasurer.

Byrd also said the sparse crowds
at the league’s ﬁrst tournament in
Philadelphia caused ofﬁcials there
to become leery of the ﬁnancial
backing and, therefore, the Spec-
trum became unavailable to the
Eastern Eight.

  Decathlete Sapienza Removes ‘Greatest’ Tag 

ByKARENKADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Decathletes are considered
among the best-conditioned ath-
letes around, and whoever becomes
the Olympic decathlon champion is
hailed as “the world’s greatest
athlete.”

Pitt’s Mike Sapienza, who
ﬁnished second in the decathlon at
last weekend’s Pitt Invitational,
ﬁnds such ﬂattery heartening but

ot entirely correct.

“I may be the best athlete that 1
compete so well in so many
events,” Sapienza explained, “but
that doesn’t necessarily mean I’m
the best athlete on the squad.

“The same thing holds true with
the world’ s-greatest-athlete tag and
the Olympics,” he continued. “In
the past athletics just meant track
and field, so whoever won the
Olympic decathlon was the world’s
greatest athlete. I don’t think that

holds true today when you have so
many great athletes competing in
sports like football, golf, baseball
and basketball.”

Decathlon events include the
100-meter dash, long jump, shot
put, high jump, 400-meter run;
110-meter hurdles, discus, pole
vault, javelin and 1,500-meter run.

Scoring is based on a comparison
‘between the competitor’s scores in
an event and on predetermined
scales. The lesser the difference
between the two, the more points a
competitor is given.

Unlike other events, a single bad
performance won’t necessarily hurt
the decathlete. If he does poorly in
one event, there is always another
in which he can boost his point total.

According to Sapienza, the
scoring system made the decathlon
one of the most misunderstood
events in track and ﬁeld.

‘ ‘People come out and see us long
jumping 20 feet or pole vaulting 13,
and they wonder, ‘how_ these guys
have the nerve to call themselves
the greatest athletes around.’

“They have a point to a certain
degree, ”
“What they don’t realize is
versatility is what distinguishes the
event and the athletes that compete
in it.”

The decathlon is the Olympics’s
glamor sport since instant fame and
fortune often go to the winner;
Bruce Jenner is reaping the beneﬁts
of winning the gold medal at the

Sapienza continued".

Srakocic photo.

1976 Montreal Olympics; Bob
Mathias, who won in both the 1948
and 1952 Olympics, starred .in a
movie about himself before be-
coming a California congressman.

The decathlon isn't so glamorous
on the collegiate level.

‘ ‘There has been a deﬁnite lack of
competition over the year,”
Sapienza said. “This was the first
year the decathlon was held at our
invitational and it didn’t become
part of the NCAA championships
until 1970.”

Like most decathletes, Sapienza
got started early. .

‘ ‘I was just fascinated with it, ’ ’ he
said. “I started reading all these
books about Bob Mathias and I

knew it was something I wanted to ‘

do.”

At 5-7, 150 pounds, Sapienza is
somewhat small for the sport;
Jenner is 6-2, 195 pounds, which is
average size.

Sapienza said that his lack of size
was discouraging at ﬁrst, until he
saw S-8, 150-pound Jeff Bennett
ﬁnish fourth in the 1972 Munich
Olympics.

‘ ‘I saw him and said if he could do
it, I could, too,” Sapienza said.
“It was at that time that I began
competing in the decathlon in high
school.”

Sapienza went to Ohio State
before transferring to Pitt as a
sophomore. He wants to qualify for
next year’s NCAA championships,
which will be his last at Pitt.

Sapienza has something deﬁnite
he wants to do after that.

“The decathlon is the best thing
in my life, ” he said. “I would like to
continue training for the 1984
Olympics.”

Panthers Close Baseball Season by Dropping Pair

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team (11-17-1), winless
in 13 of its last 15 games, closed out its
season last week by losing, 8-2, to Bucknell
and, 23-5, to Temple.

While holding the Panthers to ﬁve hits,

Bucknell collected six unearned runs off

pitchers Marc Bianco and Dave Crist.
In the other game, NCAA playoff-bound
Temple_ (30-7) banged out 19 hits to win
going away. Pitt had 10 hits, and one of
them, Art Bortnik’s grand slam in the
seventh inning, accounted for four of the
ﬁve Panther runs. ~

“Our pitchers just couldn’t stop either of
the teams,” Pitt coach Bobby Lewis said.
“They’re both strong clubs, but that’s still
no excuse for the way We P1aY€d-

“I got to use a lot of m)’ Younger P13)’€1'S
though,” he said. “At one time all eight of
our guys were either sophomores or

g freshmen.”

Catchers Jimmy Pastin and Dave DiCello
were Pitt’s hitting stars. Pastin had. a
two-for-four outing against Bucknell, while
DiCello, one of 14 walk-ons on the squad-
was perfect at two i}t,1?§t,5,‘¥g“}‘n.5»t Temple‘

COACH BOBBY LEWIS

Rain canceled the Panthers’ game at
Gettysburg, where they were to play before
traveling to Bucknell and Temple. It was
only the Panthers’ second rainout of the
year, the other being the season-opening
doubleheader at Robert Morris.

Don Koller (one inning), Tony DiSaia
“hfeelv Mike Lu9§<.>W. (tW9)..a11.d.. Tim Moran

(two) pitched against Temple. Koller, who
took the loss against the Owls, is the only
member of the Pitt pitching staff with a
three-digit won-loss record. The junior from
Pleasant Hills was the pitcher of record in
Pitt’s controversial 4-4 tie with Penn State
two weeks ago at Trees Field.

Freshman Rich Kline, the starting
leftﬁelder from Miami, ﬁnished with a
team-leading .333 batting average. Going
into the season, Kline said one of his main
goals was “just to letter in college ball.”

PYITCHES: Fall baseball is on tap for Pitt
this September. Lewis said he already has a
few games lined up with Camegie-Mellon
and Robert Morris, with a game or two
against Duquesne a possibility. The fall
games would count toward the team's
overall won-loss record.

“By playing fall baseball, the NCAA
ﬁgures we can cut down on the number of
cancellations in the spring,” Lewis said...

Looking at the West Virginia baseball
team, the Pitt coach feels fortunate that his
team played as many games as it did. The
Mountaineers had 14 of their games

canceled" because of inclement weather.“ .

Would
you
help

 

_ When the dam broke at Buffalo Creek, West I

Virginia, a lot of people wcren’t as lucky as
this little guy.

Jamie and the rest of the Mosley family
made it up the hill just in the nick of time.
Seconds later, a wall of water swept all their
earthly possessions away.

Here you see Jamie in the Red Cross
shelter, thinking it all over.

One look at that face, and we’re awfully
glad we were there to help.

Every year, you know, Red Cross
touches the lives of millions upon millions
of Americans. Rich. Poor. Average. Black.
White. Christian and Jew. With support.
With comfort. With a helping hand when
they need it.

So when you open your heart, with your
time or your money, you can be certain it’s
in the right place.
