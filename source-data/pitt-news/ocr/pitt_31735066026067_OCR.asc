Pitt administrators respond
to calls for a better campus

Last night's town hall meeting initially looked like a bust.‘

Only 20 students dotted the 150 seats arranged in the student union's
Ballroom.

The panel consisted of seven representatives from Student Health
Services, the Department of Food Services, and the Department of
Housing waited patiently.

It seemed they would have few questions to answer.

But those 20 students kept the panel busy for an hour, 25 minutes
longer than the open-ﬂoor portion of the town hall meeting should have
lasted

The questions seemed endless, and Student Government Board
President Alyson Wallach had to step in to close the meeting.

Among those in attendance, freshman Ray Murphy said the event
was good for making initial contact with the 

Murphy explained he would prefer to meet with some of the pan-
elists individually to express his concerns but that the question-and-
answer fomiat was an adequate way to make the proper contacts.

One of Murphy's concerns was about ﬁ'ee—condom distribution and
AIDS awareness on campus.

Pitt dorms: too many decisions, too little housing

Monica Mayk

Staff Wrlter

Ryan “Chach” Higgins wanted to live
in the center of campus.

Kristy Howells wanted a kitchen.

Loren Wells wanted his own space.

When it comes to on-campus hous-
ing, these students have a lot to choose
from. No two residence halls look alike or
have the same amenities. “With all the pos-
sibilities, choosing the right residence hall
can get complicated.

"It is really, really confusing, and they
[Housing] don't exactly give you the best
directions," said senior Michelle Safarik,
who has lived on campus all four years
while at Pitt.

To ease the overwhelming confusion
often associated with choosing a new
room on campus, students can talk to
friends who live in other buildings or
attend help sessions held in their current
dorms.

Many freshmen live in Towers A or B
and ﬁnd themselves at a loss when they
have to choose a room or suite in a differ-
ent building, after spending a year living in

there." A
Since Pitt does not provide tours, stu-
dents take it upon themselves to check out
residence halls before selecting a place to

By talking to students living in
Holland, a women’s dorm, Howells and
her friends discovered that comer rooms
have the most space and certain rooms
have bathroom-size walk-in closets or
shelved pantries. She also leamed that

ﬂoors have the same layout patterns from
the third ﬂoor up and that each ﬂoor has a
communal kitchen. Some rooms‘ on the
second ﬂoor share a private bath between
four women or two adjoining rooms, but
Howells learned from residents that upper-
class women often retain those rooms.

Even though she initially wanted a
suite, Howells opted for a Holland Hall
comer room with a walk-in closet. She
said she likes the character of Holland’s
rooms, which used to be apartments.
Much of this tum-of-the—century build-
ing’s original ﬂoor moldings and room
designs remain, even though Pitt recently
remodeled the building.

"I like Holland because the rooms are
different. It's not like Towers, with rooms
like a jail cell," Howells said.

Sutherland Hall, the newest hall on
campus, has been popular because of its
roomy suites with private bathrooms and

ELAINE CUFFORD/ STAFF WRITER

Brandon Whale shows UPMC doctors how he improved his mother's pacemaker.‘

Thursday, 12 March 1998

Eight-year-old helps UPMC
improve pacemakers

Elaine Clifford

Staff Writer

Brandon Whale proudly displayed his
drawing of two blue elephants spraying
water into the air with the words, "Two ele-
phants in love," written in neat block letters
under the elephants.

The 8-year-o1d's enthusiasm was mir-
rored by his 5-year-old brother, Spencer,
who meticulously drew a royal prince
while medical personnel gathered in the
Presbyterian Hospital room to express awe
at Whale's three-foot inventors chart, which
uses photographs and bright yellow cards
to detail the steps he took to invent new
pieces for his mother's pacemaker bracelet.

Brandon joyfully handed out signed
drawings along with his own personalized
business cards, which he retrieved from his
small black briefcase.

Ever since Brandon entered his project
into the Ross Elementary invention con-
vention fair and won ﬁrst place, he has lit-
erally become famous. He is in the process
of trying to get a‘ patent for the changes he
made that make his mothers life easier.

Since his mother, Danette Rocco,
received a pacemaker in May of 1995, she
has gone to Presbyterian Hospital every six
months with Debbie Peterson, a coordina-
tor at the pacemaker clinic, and makes
bimonthly calls to Rita Hughes, a cardiac
technician.

Rocco's phone has a special jack built
into it that allows electrical bracelets to be
hooked up so Hughes can monitor Rocco's
heart rate over the phone. It was during
Rocco's bimonthly calls that Brandon
noticed a problem.

Brandon said he saw her struggling to
tighten the bracelet's band, which resem-
bles a metal wristwatch band, and thought
he could make a better-ﬁtting bracelet out
of a cottony, spandex band. He also felt that
the process of getting a glass of water and

wetting the metal piece on the inside of the
band took too long.

Brandon began to work on these ideas
a day after he decided to participate in Ross
Elementary School's invention convention.
For over a month, he wrote out a daily jour-
nal about where he came up with his ideas
and how he made them a reality.

He began by contacting the UPMC
Health System's pacemaker clinic and was
put in contact with Hughes and Peterson.

After he had sewn on the spandex band
in place of the metal one, he discovered that
sponges worked best to wet the metal piece
that monitors the heartbeat.

Then, during one of his visits to
Borders Books and Music to hear Captain
Science speak, he found a book about how
the hydrating children's drink Pedialyte
conducts electrolytes better than water and
started investigating. He started by wetting
sponges with Pedialyte and placing them
on his mom's wrist.

He ran three different transmissions
tests, one with water, one with Pedialyte
and one with nothing. The Pedialyte
worked best, and from then on he began
using the Pedialyte with each call that his
mom made to Hughes with the new
bracelet. «

His only remaining goal was to have
the sponges already moist and on hand, like
moist handwipes. He remembered seeing
in the deli section of a food store a machine
that made airtight packages, and so after
many discarded ideas, he discovered that
the machine used at the deli was a
Eurosealer. He and his mom then bought
one and used it to seal the sponges in small
airtight plastic bags.

"Brandon's project left me ﬂabbergast-
ed," said Peterson, who helped him test his
theories. She is still amazed at his studious,
neat and focused manner.

Since his invention, Brandon has been

Freshman Angela Mancino dislikes the cramped living space in her Holland Hall quad.

Housme

spacious living rooms. Students also like
Sutl1erland’s cafeteria, convenience store
and computer lab. During the first humid
weeks of school, Sutherland’s air condi-
tioning goes over well with students, too.
Even though most suites in Sutherland
Hall permanently lost their living rooms as
a result of this year's overcrowding, Casile-
Gross said, "Sutherland is stillby and far

.. the building people want to live in."

However, some students think living
"up the hill" is just too far away from the
center of campus.

Last year, sophomore Higgins wanted
apartrnent—style living close to his classes.
He and his roommates could not afford an
apartment for this year, he said, so they
opted fora ﬁve-person suite in Bruce Hall.

"It's not as nice as Sutherland because
it's not as new," said the computer science
major. "But I just like being down on lower
campus because you don't have to deal with
the hill and shuttles and walking."

Their suite came with a stove and full-
size refrigerator, although only a few Bruce
suites still have refrigerators because the
University chose not to replace old appli-
ances as they broke down.

Angela Mancino, a freshman nutrition
major, also prefers living on lower campus.

"Sutherland is too far away, but I guess
if you're an athlete it's OK," she said.
Mancino currently lives in a Holland Hall
room with three other women. They like
living together but said they need more per-
sonal space. ,

"My space is as big as a Towers room,"
Mancino said. Ideally, she wants to live in
a suite with her own bathroom and a study
area separate ﬁom her bedroom. Mancino,

two of hercurrent roorrnnates, and another"

friend hope to acquire a four-person suite in
Brackenridge Hall for next year.

Mancino and her roommate, freshman
Jamie Pierce, said it's impossible to ﬁnd
time alone in their Holland quad.

"I wo11ld like a single‘ because I'm a
light sleeper," said Pierce, a pre-law major.
"You can never be alone here. A couple of
singles connected with a common bath-

asulem :l:IV.l§ >uvw

room would be nice." _

Singles with shared living areas sound
great to many students, but until Pitt builds
its plarmed apartment building in South
Oakland, the University limits students to
singles in Lothrop Hall, Tower C and all-
female Holland Hall.

Lothrop Hall, located just off Fifth
Avenue near Children's Hospital, requires a
walk to the center campus for food and
classes. Lothrop used to have a cafeteria,
but a ﬁtness center and convenience store
replaced it three years ago. a

According to Casile-Gross, many stu-
dents like I_.othrop because of the ﬁtness
center, although some request to live closer
to the center campus once the school year
starts. Medical students often choose
Lothrop because it sits in the midst of Pitt
medical buildings, UPMC facilities and
Children's Hospital. However, light sleep-
ers are disturbed by incoming helicopters
ﬂying past Lothrop's windows in the rnid—
dle of the night. _

Lothrop single rooms have 151 square
feet, compared to Tower C singles‘ 115
square feet. However, the living space
remains the same due to Lothrop roorns'
having sinks. Many students like Tower C
because of its location on the center carn-
pus and the short walk -downstairs to
Eddie's and the C-Side cafeteria. But Tower
C rooms resemble a Towers A or B double
cut in half, and its single wedges can feel
cramped.

Pitt placed senior Michelle Safarik in a
Lothrop single for her freshman year.

"I really liked it because I could study
when I wanted to, I could get up or go to
sleep when I wanted to, and if I had a bad
day I could just close the door and not
worry about a roommate," said the biolog-
ical sciences major.

As a sophomore, Safarik moved to a
Holland single that featured perks like a
full—length mirror, a pantry and a walk—in
closet. She felt unsure about living with
only women at ﬁrst, but found that every-
one on her ﬂoor interacted.

Student Health Services Director Paul
Ferraro said he would be happy to provide
those services but added, "Nothing comes
without cost." He said he could only do
these things if frmding was available to his
organization.

"I only have so much money," he
explained

After this discussion, during which
most of the crowd chattered quietly about
Murphy's questions and Ferraro's replies,
the two agreed to examine the concerns in
more detail later.

Although condoms and AIDS aware-
ness may have been the most intently dis-
cussed point, the Department of Food
Services received the nrost questions.

From concerns about high prices to

  

increasing the amount of vegan options at
Pitt's cafeterias, Food Services Director
Betsy Sallade-Farina and three of her co-
workers ﬁelded more than a dozen ques-
tions.

"They're restaurant prices as opposed
to grocery store prices," said Sallade-Farina
about one student's concern that Ocean
Spray drinks and other items were priced _
too high. .

Her comment receiving the greatest
crowd reaction was in response to a student
who asked for more noncaffeinated drink
options in vending machines on campus.

"I can make that call tomorrow," said
Sallade-Farina The audience laughed and
seemed surprised that she could act so
quickly.

from the Department of Housing, also
received their share of questions.

One student asked if their departments
could do anything about poor oﬂ’-campus
housing.

"You folks have a lot of control your-
self," said O'Shauglmessy. "If you walk in
[when visiting apartments] and see a place
that's roach-infested with a leaky roof, you
don't have to live there."

The pair also had to face questions
from a few students who sought a more in-
depth survey for dormitory residents to
complete before moving on campus.

The three or four students who wanted
interest surveys said roommates could be
paired more compatibly with a question-
naire.»

"It's not a perfect science, though," said
O'Shaughnessy. "Friends all through high

concern about the low tumout. But he
claimed to have a solution.

and awards. He's received a full scholarship
to Inventures, an invention camp affiliated
with Akron, Ohio's national inventors
museum. Also, the Ross Township Board of
Commissions will honor him at a public
meeting.

Rocco, the petite, single working moth-

  

erof the two boys, sat beside the boys and '
recalled how Brandon came up to her a few .

weeks ago and said to her in a serious tone
he felt he was old enough to open his own
bank account and if he was going to be able
to afford a Lexus like his grandfather's, he'd
have to start saving now.

Rocco commented that Brandon's
meticulous and artistic nature may be
derived from his love of art and math,
which are his favorite subjects.

Rather then turn in a handwritten jour-
nal, Brandon typed out his science-fair diary
because he felt it was neater without the
eraser marks. And he invested many hours
on the design of his invention chart.

* "Brandon recognizes that hard work
pays off. He wants to be a doctor, and he
knows he'll have to work hard to get there,"
said Rocco.

"In Holland, you have singles, dou-
bles, triples  Holland is right in the center
[of campus], and the atmosphere is good,"
Safarik said. ,

She called Holland singles "premium"
because of the hall's location and atmos-
phere and said, "Singles in Holland are
always the first to go."

Housing limits male students who
want a single to Tower C or Lothrop Hall.
Sophomore Loren Wells decided before his
freshman year to live in a Tower C single
because he likes having his own space.

"I'm an only child. The only thing I've
ever shared a room with is my dog. When
you don't grow up with siblings and you
don't know how to tolerate living with peo-
ple your own age, living alone is best," said
the ﬁnance major.

Many students forget about Forbes
Hall, a small, four—story dorm located on
Forbes Avenue across from the Exxon gas
station. Forbes houses about 250 students
in mostly doubles and triples. The entire
building has air conditioning — unlike
halls located in Schenley Quadrangle at the
center of campus — and some rooms have
balconies overlooking Forbes Avenue.

"A neat thing about Forbes is they have
private baths," said Casile—Gross. Students
still use communal showers, but four or six
people share a private sink and toilet.
Casile—Gross said many students who
choose Forbes really like the privacy the
baths provide.

In McCormick Hall, one of the older
buildings in Schenley Quad, students can
live in suites that house from two to eight
people. All suites have a bath, all but one
has a kitchen, and about half have a living
room.

Students most covet McCorrnick's
four cathedral suites, two— story suites hous-
ing ﬁve or seven people. Casile—Gross said
many students retain cathedral suites
because of their spaciousness.

Students also need to consider pricing
when choosing on—campus housing. The
ﬁne print on the back of housing contracts
lists pricing for all housing combinations
on campus based on the previous year's
semester rates.

Singles are the most expensive hous-
ing at $1,784 per semester in every dorm.

Some things aren't
worth the risks

An Allegheny County judge made a decision two
months ago to risk the well-being of a child.

Judge Max Baer ruled to allow a 5-year-old girl
to remain in the foster care of a 74-year-old man
who, in 1960, impregnated his 13-year-old daughter
and was later convicted of incest, sodomy, corrupting
the morals of a minor, adultery, fornication and bas-
tardy, and sentenced to 11 to 23 months in jail.

Allegheny County Children and Youth Services
ofﬁcials did not know of this man’s criminal history
before allowing him to become a foster parent
because he had been selected by an outside agency
that CYS contracts with. Apparently, that agency did
not do sufficient background research.

Despite this newly uncovered criminal history,
Judge Baer allowed the 5-year-old girl to remain in
the man’s foster care.

The judge’s decision might almost seem reason-
able when we add that this man remarried 18 years
ago, raised a stepdaughter whom he never assaulted
and has a 12-year-old son now who is doing well in
school.

That story might seem like enough‘ to give this
man a second chance — to believe that perhaps, after
38 years, he is reformed and can be trusted.

But there’s more, like the fact that his current
family doesn’t trust him. The 12-year-old son bathes
the foster child, and he and the father put her to bed
by 8:30 p.m. so that she will be asleep and safe while
the man’s current wife is working at night. (He
impregnated his daughter in 1960 while that wife was
away at work.) That seems like a rather uncomfort-
able consciousness of his history, and it cannot be a
healthy environment to live in.

If that wasn’t weird enough, consider that this
man never provided a home for his own daughter
after the incest, nor their son, nor that son’s child —
also a 5-year-old girl in foster care, and now awaiting
adoption.

It’s rather strange that he’d want to care for
someone but not for his own biological family. That
he would want to distance himself from them in this
situation is understandable and probably healthy. But
not accepting accountability for them doesn’t speak
well for his sense of responsibility.

An orphanage cannot be worse than an incestu-
ous family, and there’s no reason to take this kind of
risk with a 5-year-old girl.

Hyperbolez the lowest form of humor

James Maude
columnlst

Hyperboles suck so much that in
the process of writing this column,
the pile of pomographic magazines
in my bag was sucked into the com-
puter screen.

It feels like such a shame to use
this standard comedic device, but
because the average Pittsters love it
so much, I feel I shall have to oblige
—— to sell out.

Anyone can churn out hyper-
boles. In fact, one columnist at The
Pitt News chums them out so often
that there is indeed a support group to
help victims of his hyperbolic con-
vulsions — Victims of Hyperbole.
And recently, another columnist —‘-_ a
Polish student revolutionary --
alluded to hyperbolism in his satirical
work.

So, in this rarepopinions column,
where I will forego some of my
insanity to harness the power of
some stupidity, I thought I’d reﬂect
on life, looking at it through the eyes
of a hyperbolist.

As I was walking down Forbes
Ave., climbing over piles of garbage
with a stepladder and having to
clamp my ears shut due to the irasci-
ble noise of all the vagrants and burns
begging for $5,000 in short change, a
strange thought occurred to me. It
shook me so much that passersby
who thought I was doing a moon-
walk threw quarters at me, because
with The Wedding Singer grossing
$560,435,809,304,978,205,666,801
at the box ofﬁce, the ‘80s are back in
a big way (bigger than the hair of the
time, in fact). I used these quarters to
purchase a Big Mac, which was so
fatty and caused indigestion and nau-
sea, it was aptly named the McJesse
Helms burger.

Anyway, I thought to myself that
I was not living my life to its full
potential. Invariably, any person who
takes economics as his or her major
is not living life to its full potential,
but my life is so dull that whenever I
visit an old—age home, the old people
yawn at me. Now,
what can I do to
overcome this? I

would go with some degenerate
friends of mine to a strip club. The
club, located in the cosmopolitan
borough of New Brighton, Pa., in

, snazzy Beaver County, was so seedy,

it was called the Watermelon.

We eyed out the “strippers, slip-
ping dollar bills into their garters,
watching their moves. There was so
much cigar smoke, the neon lights
actually lit it up and aided visibility.
It was so thick, the strippers actually
counted it as an item of clothing.

I left the club feeling disappoint-
ed, as I’d sunk to that level of des-
peration. I felt so low; if there was a
movie about me being made about
my retum from my fall from grace, it
would be called Deep Rising (or
Satan’s Lovechild —- A Biography).
My comeback would have to be of
John Travolta or Burt Reynolds pro-

. portions, I would have to redeem

myself. Indeed, in next week’s col-
umn I will try to redeem myself from

THE PITT NEWS

 

this pile of literary hogwash.
Redemption does not come like
Pamela Anderson (i.e., easy), so I
will have to work hard to achieve it.
So hard, that my ﬁngers are slipping
and sliding off the keys due to sweat
induced by this excess toil and strain.

‘ Hyperboles are, in
essence, if there is

thought about indeed any essence
ﬁnding a new girl- to them at all, a
friend, but my cheap form of
exes dated statisti— humor. Anyone
cians after me to can compose
be with an exciting them, and unfortu-
guy, so any poten- nately, 90 percent
tial girlfriend of society loves
would have to be them. Lower
as dull as the green forms of exaggera-
moss that grows on Strom tion are evident in the mass media, as
’I'l1urmond’s back. , seen in shows such as “Jerry

I decided that on the weekend, I Springer” that show a souped-up-for-

TV version of America’s “proud to
be trailer-park class.”

I will be glad when the day
comes, when hyperboles will be rel-
egated to the status held at this
moment by another language
comedic device: the pun. Puns are so
silly and so ﬁinine. Why do we use
such a_s__s_inine comedic devices? Who
knows? I guess God is an aﬁinine

fellow as well.

The end of the hyperbole is nigh,
my friends. Maybe we should place
more emphasis on satire. And maybe
I should not have used hyperboles to
oondenm hyperboles, which is a case
of ﬁghting ﬁre with ﬁre, but what can
one do? .

There is hope: so much hope that
Jesus Chn'st’s retum will look like a
teddy bear’s picnic.

James Maude never thought he’d be
funny because hyperboles are so
passe.

There's more to Cl career than how much it pays

Jennifer Stoltz

Columnist

Too , many people seem to be
avoiding careers for purely financial
reasons. Education, for example, is
an unattractive field for many, espe-
cially in math and the sciences,
because most positions just don’t pay
very well.

In 1997, over 11,000 college
graduates were applying for only
about 2,000 open positions in this
state_alone. Sounds bad, right?

I Wrong. The only thing that’s bad

, is that there are districts in this state

that can’t fill certain positions for the
life of them, simply because they are
in smaller, rural areas and can’t pay
quite as much as districts in typical
suburbia. When you take into consid-
eration that many “first-year educa-
tors” end up in assistant or parapro-
fessional positions, you realize that
there are available ' candidates who
are simply not looking into all of
their options.

Teachers at the elementary school
level are abundant, and schools nor-
mally have no problem filling open-
ings. In fact, they merely have to
chose from the hundreds of applica-
tions that their districts have on file.
When you get to the secondary level,
however, it is. far from that simple.

Rural districts are having major
problems finding qualified teachers
who are interested in committing to

their schools, especially in science,
math and related subjects.

The Warren County School
District placed ads around the state
for a teaching position in its physics
department and received three appli-
cations. The usual
applicant pool for
elementary slots is
about 200 for that
district. So what did
that superintendent
do? He applied to
the state for an
emergency certifica-
tion of a teacher
with no physics
training. It was his
only option. Another
Pennsylvania district
had no applicants for
a physics teacher
position. It also
applied for emer-
gency certification, this time so a
local engineer, not even a teacher by
profession, could take the job.

Why is this happening? This
problem is I not isolated to
Pennsylvania. and is not really that
new. In the late 1960s and the ‘70s,
the growing technological industry
began to offer more jobs and higher
salaries to women and minorities.
Teaching standards also became more
complex soon after. The feeling is
generally one where those talented in
math and science, with a pure moti-

She said

vation and excitement for what their
specialty is, are being turned off by
the education field. Its lower salaries
and lesser public glory sometimes
steer people away. Those already

. with their hearts set on education are

many times apprehen-
sive about teaching
such subjects.

This should not be the
case. Science and
math are two of this
countr.y’s most rapid-
ly growing fields, so
the importance of
teaching these sub-
jects should not be
brushed aside. No,
they won’t be multi-
millionaires, but all
that should matter is
that these teachers are
making a living and
making an immeasur-
able difference in the life of a child.
Teachers inspire their students to pur-
sue paths that they otherwise may not
have been introduced to. If the teach-
ers aren’t there to do that, what would
they be missing out on?

Obviously, this is not the whole
reason, for the rural shortage.
Graduates are simply ignoring or
totally missing the fact that there are
opportunities out there with their
names on them. Everyone thinks of a
teacher in a suburban, middle-class
community, where a sports team is

the hero or heroine of the school and
the Valedictorian goes off to an Ivy
League school. Well, what about the
districts where the homes aren’t
arranged in plans, where the distance
between houses is great but the unity
of the community is closely knit?
What about these districts is less
deserving of good, qualified, enthusi-
astic teachers? Nothing, nothing at
all. These kids deserve a good educa-
tion just as much as does everyone
else.

Think back to your days in high
school. Those were some of the most
formative days of your life, even if
you don’t realize it. Think back to a
teacher who really made a difference.
Maybe he inspired you to choose the
career path you did or he encouraged
you not to give up when you hit a
stumbling block in that really hard
subject. Maybe he was there for you
in the confusing time when school
was the only thing that stayed the
same every day in your life. Either
way, you probably have someone
who fits this description. However, if
more teachers don’t go into the sci-
ence and math fields, and if they
aren’t equally distributed between
districts, this description may not be
filled for many students to come.

Jen Stoltz thinks that too many people
are worried about how much a job
pays in dollars instead of what it pays
in gratification.

Don't ruin Pih"s
abilily to educate
undergraduates

I have a favor to ask from the
administration: Please don’t make me
look stupid to my mother.

Two years ago, I spent many
nights arguing with her about why Pitt
was my best choice. But now I’m wor-
ried that I may have made a big mis-
take.

As I write this, there are actions
being taken at this university which
are undermining the quality of an
undergraduate education. When I read
about the faculty retirement plan this
fall, I was ignorant of the intentions of
some departments to dump their non-
researching faculty.

With" the undergraduates making
up the majority of the student body
(and the ones paying your salaries), it
should be your top priority to retain
those professors who are the most
devoted to and passionate about under-

   
 
 

   
 

graduate teaching.

. But you seem to have your priori-
ties confused. You are running this
university like a company and ignor-
ing the academic endeavor. Most com-
panies are smarter than yours; they
wouldn’t ﬁre their best employees in
an effort to be “cost effective.” The
message you are sending prospective
faculty is loud and clear: You don’t
care about the quality of their work,
only the amount of money they can
bring you with their research.

And you won’t attract quality peo-

ple because they'll know they’re
expendable, too.

When prospective students learn
the joke that a Pitt undergraduate edu-
cation has become, you’ll ﬁnd your-
self begging students to come here.
When those students who are already
here understand what you’re doing,
and when they see that they’re doing
everything they can to supplement a
degree that will be meaningless, you’ll
lose them as well.

tion rates and’ about the ratings Pitt

receives in national reports, and yet
you’re digging yourself deeper into
this hole of mediocrity.

I applaud the research efforts at
this university (and that’s one of the
reasons that I. came), but if you’re
going to build up the research image at
the cost of the undergraduate educa-
tion, you’re going to fail.

By the time your plans are ful-
filled, the undergraduate degree won’t
be worth the paper it’s printed on. And
once the graduates realize this, you
won’t be getting any money from your
disappointed alumni.

To all the undergraduates and any-
one else who cares about the quality of
our education, please join with me in
standing up to the administration and
ﬁghting these efforts to degrade the
meaning of the degree we’re working
so hard (and going into debt) for.

And to the administration at this
fine university, I strongly urge you to
tag the undergraduate bucks, to make
sure our tuition is going toward our
education, so I ean tell my mom we’re
not wasting ours.

play of sport the world has to offer.

When the clock strikes 12:15 p.rn.

And when I say change, I don’t mean
like changing-clothes change or shave—side—
bums change. I am talking about l0O—per—

will be and who will become the next

like Chris Webber did and hand North
Carolina the national championship yet
again?

Everyone who has ever watched a col-

answer, but just like in the fateful night to
come in San Antonio three weeks from now,
only one will be left standing.

Here are some tips that will either help
you ﬁll in those vacant slots that you just
can’t seem to ﬁll out or make you break out
the eraser and change who, out of the over

standing at the AlamoDome.

Spring practice starts today

Conditioning tro rc postponement of on-field workouts

Rachel Lenzi

Staff Wrlter

Spring break harmed the
Pitt football team more than
helped it.

This year’s spring foot-
ball drills have been delayed
until today because, accord-
ing to Head Coach Walt
Harris, members of the foot-
ball team returned to Pitt out
of condition.

After a two—day delay,
the team announced that
spring drills will begin at
2:30 p.m. today at Pitt

  Hesatd    

 

elaborate on the delay in
workouts. Harris has not
been available for comment
since the press conference.

In other football news,
punter Grant Cofﬁeld will
not return to the football
team because his scholarship
was not renewed. Last sea-
son Coffield was the
Panthers’ starting punter. In
13 games last season, he
totaled 487 total punting
yards with an average of 37.5
yards per punt.

Defensive lineman
Calvin Robinson also left the

 

Stadium, instead of on
Tuesday.

At a press conference on
Monday, Harris explained
why the drills were delayed.

“Quite honestly, it’s a lot
to expect of some guys who
go home, when they’ve been
doing that for two weeks, to
ﬁnally have a week off and
to kick back. They’re learn-
ing a valuable lesson, that
you can’t do in a program
that’s plarming on being suc-
cessful. You have got to

   

tram. I’m disappointed that

we didn’t have more leader-
ship, we didn’t learn from
our winning edge.”

The team’s first workout
on Monday morning proved
fruitless for Harris, who
noticed the team’s faults.

“We did not perform this
[Monday] morning like we
had put a lot of effort in. If
football was important to
you, then you’d be in shape
when you came back in here

 

on Monday. We were hurt-
ing.
“We’re not at the point
where we need to go out
there and put on the uni-
form,” Harris said. “But
we’ll be working out at 6
a.m. at the Cost Center, and
it’s open to the public if any-
one’s free at that time.”
Director of Football
Operations Chris LaSala ver-
iﬁed that spring drills would
start today but would not

team, and two other players,
tight end John Jones and
offensive lineman John
Raymond, were dismissed
from the football team for
violating team policy.

As for the current state
of the football program,
Harris expressed his frustra-
tion but also emphasized the
expectations for this spring.

“I’m disappointed. I’m
not mad at anybody. It just
shows how much of a job we
have to do.”

Mengerink,
Loper take

titles at EWL
tournament

Brlan Knavlsh

Staff Wrlter

This past weekend, Pitt’s Rob Loper
and Nick Mengerink were crowned
Eastern Wrestling League champions.

The two roommates highlighted last
year’s recruiting class —— a class consid-
ered by many to be the best in the history
of Pitt wrestling. The two “blue chippers”
appeared to have so much potential that
their recruiting class was ranked in the
nation’s top 10.

Optimism is the one thing that
always comes with recruiting classes, but
all that potential doesn’t win champi-
onships unless the prospects pan out, and

 
     

   the Pi fresnian  win  gold in more than fifteen years.

a lot of times that doesn’t happen.

“I’d be lying if I said I expected those
guys to be EWL champs already,” Head
Coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “Those
guys did a great job. Neither one of them
has lost since the Las Vegas tournament
[Dec. 5-6], so they’re on a good roll.”

Loper, who was competing in his‘

second EWL tournament, was seeded
second in the 126—pound weight class.
After falling one match short of the con-

wooroilj "3Jvl§ /zrot. l3VHDlW

ference championship last year, Loper
could taste that gold, which further fueled
his desire for the title.

“Last year I was a true freshman, so I
was a little intimidated,” Loper said. “But
this year I was a lot more relaxed. Once I
got to the ﬁnals, I said, ‘I am not going
home with second place this time. I’m
going to win it”’

Loper showed early that he came to

Spring Break Sports Briefs

Meece only
definite for

NCAA swim field

Winning the Big East championship a
few weeks ago wasn’t enough, so ﬁve mem-
bers of the Pitt’s men’s swimming team ven-
tured to two meets over spring break to qual-
ify for the upcoming NCAA championships.

Freshman Devin Meece headlined the
ﬁve swimmers who traveled to the
University of Texas for the inaugural
American Short Course Championships this
past weekend. -

All ﬁve swimmers attempted to gain
faster seed times for entry into the NCAA
championships, which will be held in two
weeks at Auburn University.

“We were quite successful this week-
end,” said Pitt Head Coach Chuck Knoles.
“We were able to set three school records
and record several faster times for our
NCAA entry.”

Although Meece made the automatic
cut in the 100-yard breaststroke with a Pitt
record time of 54.27, both Jon Haggerty and
MichaelProncamewithinaquarterofasec—
ond of making the NCAA cut.

Haggerty put up lifetime and Pitt bests
in the 200—yard butterﬂy, his specialty event

“Jon reset his own school record this
weekend, lowering“ his time by half a sec-
ond. His time of 1:47.53 will place him
about 23rd in the nation,” Knoles said “He
may get lucky and be invited to the [NCAA]
meet.”

Normally, according to Knoles, the

NCAA championships include only the
fastest 21 or 22 swimmers. »

Pron swam a lifetime best in the 200-
yard breaststroke but will likely be about .38
of a second away from making the NCAA
meet, according to Knoles.

‘These guys are doing very well to be
competing in the very top of their sport,”
Knoles said. “I am very proud of their
accomplishments this season.” -

The swimmers, who are awaiting word
on whether they have qualiﬁed for the
NCAA championships, will learn their fate
when invitations go out later today.

Two close losses
for Panther
gymnastics

While some students were at home or
the beach last week during spring break, oth-
ers, like the members of the Pitt women’s
gyrrmastics team, had to stay behind

The gymnasts stayed in Pittsburgh to
prepare for two meets against Ohio State and
University of New Hampshire.

“We were underdogs going into the

meet against Ohio State,” said gymnast
Colleen Crisi. This was a no—pressure situa-
tion for the team, according to Crisi, and a
chance to prove everyone wrong.

After the meet’s ﬁrst two rotations
(vault and uneven bars), the Panthers led the
Buckeyes in overall scoring, thanks to meet-
high vault scores posted by Crisi and
Samantha Salyers.

But despite the opening volley, Ohio
State would come back.

Falls hurt the Panthers in the second half
of action. Four out of six Panthers fell from
the balance beam, hurting the team’s scores
signiﬁcantly.

The team tried a comeback in its last
event, the ﬂoor exercise. It topped Ohio
State, 46.925 to 45.275, for the event, but fell
short overall for the day with a 188.525 to
187.825 loss.

The gymnasts had to put this loss
behind them and prepare for an away meet
the next week — March 8 against the
University of New Hampshire.

Like the OSU contest, Pitt led after the
vault and the bars. But the Panthers couldn’t
help but sit back and watch the excellent bal-
ance-bearn performances by Suzanne Poretz
and Amy Roberts of New Hampshire. The
gyrrmasts scored 9.850 and 9.825 in this
event, cutling into the Panthers’ lead

It got worse.

Theteamhadtorep1aceCalliBodnarin
the ﬂoor exercise routine. She hurt her foot
on the vault rotation and was unable to come
back and perform during the meet.

Pitt was outscoredinboth thebeam and
the ﬂoor exercise, making the ﬁnal score
193.575 to 190.475 for New Hampshire.

The team will have its ﬁnal regular-sea-
son home meet on Saturday against Towson
State at 7 p.m.

Slialbrack leads
Pill tennis to 2-1
record over break

Pitt Panther tennis player Erin
Shalbrack dominated each of her matches
last week when the team traveled to
California during spring break

Shehadarecordofthreewinsandno
losses in her singles matches and a record of
1-1 in her doubles matches with partner Fran
Davis.

The tennis team went to California to
face the University of San Francisco,
Dominican College of San Rafael, and Big
East foe Providence.

Pitt defeated San Francisco, 5-1, and
completely swept Dominican, 9-0.
However, it lost to Providence, 6-1, in the
team’s ﬁrst Big East match-up of the 1998
season. A

The Panthers, now 9-5 on the season,
will face Youngstown State today at 3 p.m
in the Cost Center.

the tournament to win it by embarrassing
Clarion’s Dominic Surra, 22-7, in his ﬁrst
match of the day. He followed that up with
a dominating 7-2 victory over West
V1rginia’s Bob Patnesky in the semiﬁnals
before beating Edinboro’s Kevin Sangia,
3-2, in the championship match. That
match was more lopsided than the score
might indicate, thanks to a few Loper take-
downs that were not recorded because
Sangia landed out of bounds.

Mengerink, who was competing in his
ﬁrst EWL tournament after sitting out last

season with a redshirt, became just the sec— p

ond freshman in Pitt history to win the
conference title (Doug Haines won the

1982).

The 167-pounder exploded onto the
wrestling scene this year, putting together
one of the most impressive rookie seasons
in Pitt history. He compiled a stunning 31-
3 record, earning him the No. 1 seed in the
tournament.

After earning the luxury of a ﬁrst-
round bye, the freshman showed the poise
of a senior in his two 1-0 nail-biting wins
over Cleveland State’s Josh Didion in the
semiﬁnals and Clarion’s Jason Moaney in
the ﬁnals.

Loper and Mengerink became ‘the
16th and 17th EWL champs in Panther his-
tory and the ﬁrst two since J.J. Fasnacht
and Pat Vﬁtlanger captured ﬁrst place in
1996.

The two champions automatically
qualify for the NCAA championships, but

they’re not the only Panthers who will be
in Cleveland next weekend. The top three
wrestlers in each weight class and six wild
card grapplers (voted on by EWL coaches)
get the opportunity to compete in the pres-
tigious tournament.

This year, six Panthers qualiﬁed for
the NCAA championships, one short of the
team-record seven who qualiﬁed last year.

Mark Bodo (190) and John Withrow
(177) continued their quests to become
three-time All—Americans by capturing
second and third place, respectively, at the
EWL meet. The tearn’s other qualiﬁers
include fourth-place ﬁnishers Chad Jesko

‘ (134) and Mike Ziska (142).

Jake Schaus (who ﬁnished ﬁfth last
weekend) is the conference’s ﬁrst alternate
at 158 and will go to the NCAAs if anoth-
er EWL grappler gets hurt or fails to make

13

weight. The alternate has gone to the

NCAAs in each of the past four years.
Brian Pardini captured fourth at 150

but was not selected as an alternate. Shawn

Amistade (118) and Matt Mueller (heavy- '

weight) also wrestled but did not qualify
for NCAAS.

As a team, the Panthers ﬁnished third
in the tournament after ﬁnishing second in
the EWL during the dual-meet season.
Despite this ﬁnish, some consider the sea-
son a little disappointing because the team
was favored to win the conference.

“The focus is always on the things we

V didn’t do instead of the things we did do,

but we did a lot . of good things,”
Stottlemyer said “We ﬁnished 14th [in the
nation] and third in a tournament with ﬁve

top-25 teams, so I don’t consider the sea- 9

son a disappointment.” .

Phi Beta Kappa—the national liberal arts honorary society founded by Thomas Jefferson
and colleagues in the eighteenth century-—seeks nominees (including self nominees) for the
annual Junior Prize. '

The Phi Beta Kappa Junior Prize is awarded to an academically outstanding undergraduate
student who will (a) graduate next year (Academic Year 1998-99) and who will _(b) fulfill
the demanding breadth requirements for Phi Beta Kappa membership by the time of
graduation. The Prize consists of a $400 cash award and an inscribed medal to be awarded
at the Phi Beta Kappa initiation ceremony on Sunday, April 5, 1998.

Criteria for the Phi Beta Kappa Junior Prize are purely academic as evidence by scope and
attainment in the undergraduate curriculum of Arts and Sciences.

Are you a student who combines high achievement with significant curricular breadth
including two years (or equivalent) of college level language study? Will you graduate in
Fall Term 1998 or Spring Term 1999? Will you fulfill the relatively demanding Phi Beta
Kappa distribution requirements in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities? If
so, you may be a candidate for the Junior Prize. Additional information on Phi Beta Kappa
requirements or the Prize may be obtained from the University Honors College, 3500
Cathedral of Learning.

Please send or deliver names of nominees
(including self nominations) to:

Phi Beta Kappa Junior Prize Committee
Oiﬁce of the Dean
University Honors College
3500 Cathedral of Learning
Pittsburgh, PA 15260

 

 Deadlinefor
the receipt of nominations is
