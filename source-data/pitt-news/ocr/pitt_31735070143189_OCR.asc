  Cathedralcreation icing on the cake

‘Ace of Cakes’ star dishes on past tribulations and life as a celebrity chef

Molly Stieber
Staﬁ Writer

Duff Goldman certainly has

‘his cake.

But other people get to eat it..

Wearing faded jeans, a back-
ward baseball cap and sneakers,
the star of the Food Network show
“Ace of Cakes,” told the audience
his views on fun and fear at the
sold-out Pitt Program Council
event in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom. I

“Fun is my guiding principle
in life. Money is not. Think about
taking your least favorite class for
the rest of your life. That is not
fun,” he said.

He explained that you will nev-
er know success until you taste
fear.

Goldman described how police
chased. him for drawing graﬂiti.
He was arrested multiple times
before getting sent to a juvenile
detention center at 14.

“Nothing is as good for you as
fai1ing,” he said.=

“I was just a juvenile delinquent,
and now I’m asked to talk at places
like the University of Pittsburgh.
Why would a university like Pitt
allow me to speak here? Someone
didn’t do his or her homework,”
he joked.

There was a lot of buzz that
Goldman would make a Cathedral
of Learning-shaped cake before
the event, and despite his comple-
tion of that project, the colossal
confection was not on stage when
Goldman started speaking at 8:30
P-IIL '

Despite his cake—mak-
ing prowess, Goldman
said that he only opened
Charm City Cakes to pay
the bills. His true passion
was always to be a bassist
for a rock ’n’ roll band.

Though Goldman has
found success in a ﬁeld
that was not his original
passion, many perks have
come along with it.

On Monday, Goldman
rang the bell to open the
stock exchange in New
York.

“I’m ringing the bell,
and I look up and there
are all these traders and
they were all clapping. I
was like, ‘What universe
am I in?”’

During the question—
and—answer session of
the presentation, there
were many moments
that humored the sold-
out Ballroom. Goldman
dished about what he
thought about his fel-
low network foodies. He
said Tyler Florence and
Michael Symon are his
favorite Food Network
stars, GiadaDe Lauren-
tiis is as ﬂawless as she
seems, and Paula Deen

' is crazy in the best_sense

of the term."

“The best cake is one
that makes people smile.
We aren’t curing cancer,
but we are doing what
we can to make people
smile,” Goldman said.

Oakland
police to
multiply

Liz Navratil
News Editor

The number of police oflicers in
Oakland will increase about tenfold
for the G-20 Summit next week.

About 170 officers from various
departments will patrol the streets
of Oakland Thursday and Friday
of next week, Pitt police chief Tim
Delaney said.

He said he has between 10 and
1_8 officers "patrolling on a typical
day. The exact number depends on
the time of day.

The number of officers will
gradually increase starting next
week, Delaney said. He was reluc-
tant to provide more details.

A “You really hate to talk numbers,
because if anybody’s thinking about
causing harm, you’re telling them
what you’re doing,” he explained.

Diane Richard, a spokeswoman
for the city police, said in an e-mail
that the increase “will be dependent
on activity conducive to the need
for police presence.”

Both Richard and Delaney
said they have no idea how many
protesters will be in Oakland next
week. ‘

“You prepare for the worst and
hope for the best. I hope absolutely
nothing happens,” Delaney said.

Delaney said he will separate his
ofﬁcers into groups and give each

. team a sector of the neighborhood

to cover.
Delaney said this would reduce
response times because his officers

One ofthe ﬁrst decisions the G—20
made was to allow the World Trade

“protectionist measures,” meaning
that the country is restricting trade
to protect its own market.

G-20 ‘shames’
nonconformers

Michael Macagnone
Staﬁ’ Writer

The G-20 leaders can endorse a pletho-
ra of policies, but nothing other than peer
pressure can force governments to abide
by them. A

James Cassing, a Pitt economics profes-
sor, said one of the Summit’s main goals will
be to “get everyone going in the same direc-
tion on the economy.”

But it’s important to note, he added, that
the G-20 is “not a sovereign nation. It can’t
force countries to do what it decides,” Cass-
ing said. ‘

Countries that don’t follow agreements
are typically “shamed” by other nations in
the G-20, partially because decisions are
made based on a group consensus, he said.
I G-20 members will approach countries _
that violate their agreements and say, “Why
would you back down on your word to do
this?”,Cassing said. ‘

The most. common reason for nations
to violate a G-20 policy is if it conﬂicts with
their domestic policies, he said.

Still, Cassing said that the G-20 doesn’t,
have power to take punitive action.

to oversee and prevent another
ﬁnancial collapse.

Representatives from the EU
would like nations to place more
restrictions on their ﬁnancial insti-
tutions thanthatwhich the United
States currently does.

Douglas Branson, a Pitt law pro-
fessor, said additional oversight
would most likely put a limit on
“risk,” which could decrease the
ability of banks to lend money to

their patrons.

4 “It could eventually affect the
little guy,” he said. “It’s still very
hard for individual people to get
loans.”

Increased oversight could also
require the U.S. government to tell
institutions where they can invest
their money, which could conﬂict
with some civil liberties offered in
the United States.

Cassing said he also expects the

leaders to brainstorm ways to curb
inﬂation, which could rise after all
of the stimulus money has made its
way into the economy. A rise in in-
ﬂation could choke off the recovery
of economy, according to a report
from the University of Toronto.

Editorial

Public urination law
relief to offenders

The next time you’re urinating
off an overpass, you will probably
only incur a ﬁne. Finally. '

City Council passed legislation
Tuesday that would ban urination
and defecation in public places
such as sidewalks, parks, over-
passes and parking lots. It bans
the same acts on private property
without the owner’s consent.

Public urination is a recurring
problem in areas like South Side,
where bars are prevalent and pub-
lic bathrooms are scarce.

While Mayor Luke Ravenstahl
has yet to sign the bill into law,
we doubt he’ll take the pro—urine
stance considering the upcoming
election.

That’s a good thing.

Previously, police ofﬁcers relied
on state laws against disorderly
conduct and lewdness in lieu of a
local law speciﬁcally prohibiting
public urination.

The latter potentially landed
small-bladdered hooligans on the
list of sex offenders. Such punish-
ment is usually excessive and un-
warranted.

The new ordinance —— referred
to as “the wee-wee bill” by high-
minded Councilwoman Darlene
Harris —— merely charges offend-
ers with a ﬁne, a penalty more rea-
sonable for the offense.

On this level, City Council de-
serves at least some applause for
sympathizing with public urina-
tors. But it’s not like we should
shower them  with praise.

Prospective public urinators

beware: The initial $500 ﬁne can
rapidly double. The legislation al-
lows violators to be charged for
a separate offense if they fail “to
clean or remove the material.”

How?

This is essentially a $1,000 ﬁne.
No amount of remorse, willpower
or sheer drunken muscle is going
to cleanse the urine from a park
shrub. And if it comes down to an

extra $500 or prostrating oneself '

on a South Side sidewalk with a
handful of Bounty, we’ll tell the
officer to put it on our tab.

A ﬁne of $1,000 for a boorish
but natural mistake is inching to-
ward excessive, though it’s still far

- better than getting lumped in with

pedophiles.

However, Councilman Jim
Motznik did offer a reasonable
idea. Motznik believes state and
local leaders should provide bath-
rooms in the South Side, according
the Post-Gazette.

While the City Council law is
necessary, more bathrooms could
alleviate the problem, so long as
they were permanent structures.
Port-o—potties would present a
whole new set of problems during
the next riot. A broken bus shelter
is one thing — an obliterated port-
o—potty and its contents splattered
across town is another.

So sign the bill, Ravenstahl.
And don’t wait until after the G-20.
The last thing Pittsburgh needs is
an aftermath involving scores of
protesters ﬁghting sex offenses for
peeing in Point State Park.

Student body too apathetic

 
 
  

Jacob Brown
Columnist

Many Pitt students are lazy, apathetic
and generally selﬁsh crybabies who

care nothing about improving this '

environment we know as college. ~

If tl1is is the generation of change,
I’m worried, especially because col-
lege is supposed to be one of the
more progressive venues out there.
Let’s be honest, Pitt needs some
changing.

I sat down with SGB member Nila
Devanath for two hours so'I could
pick her brain on how the politics of
how this school really works.

What I found out was rather“

dard-fare issues like tuition costs»

and whether we’ll have school during

for those matters, very few people '

outside of forums held
by SGB, much lesstryto

pathetic..

Devanath said that

government members

the nation have told her
stories in which swarms

SGB to have direct feedback online A

with students. , -
‘Usually, SGB polling is relegated
to tabling in Towers lobby for feed-
back. If you’re an upperclassman
without a need to go to Towers,
chances are you’ll never know they
were there. The weight of any peti-

But with enough vigor, some ini-

death grip that is Student Life’s bu-

SGB president Sumter Link started.

There’s plenty to be mad about

ment without online class scheduling
to the lack of input students receive

And it’s easy enough toe-mail

representatives.

pose ideas and better our campus
than people think. SGB isn’t just
there to approve organization bud-
gets, and it’s possible to bypass them
altogether if you’re not into staying
up late on Tuesday nights.

The ﬁrst step to student—led
advocacy is understanding the po-
litical hierarchy of the University.
Dealing with Pitt is a difficult and
bureaucracy-laden process. It’s
mind-boggling, but it’s not impos-
sible to ﬁgure out.

SGB works within the limited
conﬁnes granted to it by the Office
of Student Life. SGB also has to abide
byrules regarding online polling and

enough students around campus

who don’t suffer from chronic apa- —

thy. Of the more than 17,000 under-
graduates on campus, only 3,876
students voted foranSGB presiden-
tial candidate last November.

Of those, just 1,063 people voted
for our current president, Kevin
Morrison. Morrison is well quali-
ﬁed for the position, but a mere 6.7
percent of eligible undergraduate
students voting for him does not
instill much conﬁdence in our stu-
dent body.

and Obama-rama last November,
we seem to know how to mobilize.

Jazz singer mixes old with new

Carolyn Perteete will perform Saturday, Sept. 19

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ” Writer

Carolyn Perteete
Performing at New Hazlett
Theater

Sept. 19, 8 p.m.

Starting something new can ,

be terrifying, especially for a
young singer in an older genre
of music.

“I’m probably the youngest
singer in town,” 29-year-old jazz
performer Carolyn Perteete said
in an interview with The Pitt
News. “I grew up with different
music, I’m coming from a differ-
ent place. I’m different by being
younger than people on the scene
in Pittsburgh.” _

How did this young woman
become a musician?

It kind of found her, she said.
Cliché and yet poetic; it’s the
truth.

Perteete was never too sure
about where she was going in
life.

“I always liked singing, but
I hadn’t really found anything
I thought I was really good at,”
she said.

Then, Perteete’s mother gave
her an Ella Fitzgerald CD, and
there was no question left in her
mind.

“The first moment I heard it,
the heavens opened. Everything
just clicked,” she said.

Perteete began lessons with a
local jazz singer and completed
her music degree at Duquesne
University. After that, she joined
and performed with the Sean
Jones sextet.

“When I was on tour with Sean
Jones, I got to see a lot of the
world and a lot of the country,”
she said. “I got to sing in really
great venues. That’s the highlight
of my career so far.”

Even though Perteete’s tour —

ended, she is certainly not slow-
ing down. “These days I’m feeling
more than just jazz,” she said.
“I’ve been writing my own music
for the past year.”

According to Perteete, her
music is all planned out but not
quite pop.

“I approach it vocally the same
way I approach jazz. I think the
texture of my voice ﬁts jazz but
also fits this genre that I can’t put
a name on.”

“I like being able to do both,”

/,

she added. “There aren’t many
singers who can do both.”

And she is determined to dif-
fer from other singers in as many
ways possible. .

“The most important thin
for me is people doing some-
thing different,” Perteete said.
“I appreciate musicians writing
their own music and trying to
ﬁnd their own voice, because that
was original jazz — trying to find
their own thing.”

Musicians are not doing their
jobs if they’re not trying to be
creative, according to Perteete.
“If you’re trying to do stuff to
please others and not yourself,
that’s not the point. _

“The only person I have to
satisfy is myself,” she said.

But if she can please others,
it’s certainly a pleasant bonus.

“Locally, when the greats like
Roger Humphrey see me, they
say they’re proud of me,” she
said. “That means a lot. They
don’t ‘say that to just anybody.”

But Perteete isn’t too cocky
just yet.

“I definitely know I have a lot
to learn,” she said. “I don’t think
Pll ever be quite satisﬁed.”

Perteete may be young, but she’s got the talent to impress the greats.

Kanye VMA scandal nothing new

Kanye West is a public relations nightmare

 
     

Kelsey Shea
Asst. A&E Editor

Oh, Kanye.

Whether it is his fans, his PR folks
or Beyoncé Knowles muttering it, that
one simple phrase trails behind each
and every one of Kanye West’s many
stunts over the course of his career.

After a while, it becomes pretty
run of the mill. The equation of Kanye
West plus any given award show usu-
ally equals a You'I‘ube hit, backlash
from the press, a public apology
and a world of trouble for his pub-
lic relations team. Simple enough to
follow.

But, Kanye’s shocking perfor-

-mance at the MTV’s Video Music

Awards on Sunday threw a variable

into the formula that Kanye clearly
miscalculated.

That variable was Taylor Swift’s
diabeticly sweet persona, genuine
enthusiasm and rookie status on the
VIVIA stage. Kanye’s rude declaration
could not have been bestowed on a
more innocent victim.

He really might as well have kicked
a puppy onstage.

America saw a 19-year-old, coun-
try-singing Cinderella, alldressed up
for the ball, have the moment she had
been waiting for smashed to pieces
— and got mad. ~
g But, as shocking as it was, the
Taylor Swift incident was far from
unprecedented. So, it’s interesting
that it .took ajesus-lovingecountry—
pop starto really bring the heat onto
Kanye for his behavior.

Kanye’s propensity to speak be—-

fore he think, and the fact that his

ego has swelled to be roughly the size
of the International Space Station,

have both gotten him into plenty of
situations before. ‘

So, from Kanye’s perspective,
the backlash from this particular
stunt probably came as somewhat
of a surprise. For him, this is pretty
usual behavior.

Looking back over his track re-
cord of stupid mistakes, the 2009
VMAs actually seems pretty mild.

Back at the start of his career,
Kanye furiously stormed -out of the
2004 American Music Awards after
.not winning Best New Artist.

The following year, Kanye made
headlines when he utteredthe in-

Movie forecast: ‘Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs’

New animated ﬂick delivers on acting, writing and humor

Natalie Bell

Staff Writer _

Movie: “Cloudy with a Chance
of Meatballs”
Starring: Bill HaderandAnnaFaris
Director: PhilLordandChris Miller
Studio: Sony Pictures Animation
Grade: A

“Cloudy With a Chance of Meat-
balls” falls somewhere between the
comfort of your mother’s cooking
and the novelty of a gourmet res-
taurant opening.

4 A l‘fhenostalgiaofabookyouread 

as a child and its ever-entertaining
cartoon clichés are comforting, like
mashed potatoes and macaroni and
cheese. But, a unique plot line and
3-D graphics add some interesting
spices to your ordinary children’s
movie.

Through the po st- eye-dilation-
sized 3-D glasses, the plotline un-
folds with a classic opener: a look
into the childhood of our hero, Flint
Lockwood.

  pt

As is usually the case with pro-
tagonists in children’s ﬂicks, pro-
tagonist Flint Lockwood, played by
Bill Hader, once struggled through
the hardships of individuality, mis-
understanding and taunts from his
peers.

The onlythingbuoyinghis hopes
is his understanding mother, who
hands him his ﬁrst ofﬁcial lab coat
the night of an unfortunate spray-
on shoe incident.

Fast forward several years and
numerous “oops” inventions that
have wreaked varying degrees of

havoc on his town, and you meet 

the quirky, albeit lovable, adult Flint
Lockwood.

Despite his disapproving father’s
wishes, Flint and his best friend,
Steve the monkey, toil hour after
hour in his lab on projects destined
to go awry. '

Loosely explained by the world’s
developing distaste for Flint’s home-
town’s main export, sardines, Flint
decides he can improve everyone’s
lives with a machine that converts

At about this time, Sam Sparks,

After a series of unfortunate in-

In 2006, Kanye really stepped up his game

to this week’s incident, Kanye jumped onstage

 Softball team takes 1 after walk-on tryouts

After tough tryout, senior inﬁelder earns walk-on roster spot

V0‘

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

There are a select few athletes lucky
enoughto attend college on an ath-
letic scholarship.

For the others, there’s the op-
portunity to walk on and play at the
collegiate level without that schol-
arship.

Ashlyn Zellefrow, a senior mar-
keting major, is one of those ath-
letes. -

She’s played softball since she
was young and continued her career
throughout her time at Mercyhurst
Northeast, a college in Erie.

She’s among the all—time leaders
at Mercyhurst Northeast in career
hits (80) and career stolen bases
(16).

When she transferred to Pitt,
Zellefrow didn’t want to give up par-
ticipating in the sport.

On Sept. 4, she gathered at Trees
Field with other hopefuls to try out
for a walk-on position with the Pitt
softball team.

She ﬁnished as the only girl to
make it through successfully.

Pitt head coach Holly Aprile said

the team chose Zellefrow because she .

has overall talent and a solid arm.
“She’s a versatile player,” Aprile
said. “She plays the inﬁeld. She’s

quick. We feel like we can use her on
the base paths and perhaps as aback-
up for some of our inﬁeld positions,
as well. We feel like she’ll ﬁt in.”

to try out for,” Zellefrow said.
“You could try out for any speciﬁc

position. We went and we hit balls .

in the cages and off of a live pitcher,
which was another girl trying out.”

Pitchers throw all of their dif— _

ferent pitches during tryouts, while
catchers are timed on their speed
throwing to second base. _
“Basically, we want to see the me-
chanics of the position you’re going to

ship players. _

“Generally,-if we choose some-
one, we have something in mind for
them,” Aprile said. “We’re not going

to keep someone without a plan in

mind.” T - .
Sometimes walk-ons are used as

backup position players and some-

times as pitchers, Aprile said. Ad-

ditionally, catchers are always im-

portant, because pitchers need to be .

warmed up in the bullpen.

“Also, I look for some versatility,
if she can play more than one posi-
tion,” Aprile said. ' O

“I look to see if they’re_ fast. Speed
is always good, because we needbase
runners, too.” A . «

Aprile said that once walk-ons are
chosen for the team, they participate
in everything the scholarship players
do, including practices, games and
road trips. H

“Traditionally, walk-ons are cho-
sen every year, although that can
change depending on roster spots,”
Aprile said. . - _

As for Zellefrow, she said she
wants to do as much as she can to
make the team successﬁil . and to
improve her skills throughout the
season.

“I don’t know how much playing
time I’ll personally get, but ifby prac-
ticingl can make us collectively better
and make me better, then that’s what
I want,” she said. “I want to make us
better and for us to win every game

, that we can.”

Pitt safety Elijah Fields

Kyle Craig
Sta_[fWri ter

Through the ﬁrst two weeks of the
season, the Pitt football team has
been struggling to ﬁnd consistent
play from its secondary.

That task will only become
more diﬂicult now that starting
free safety Andrew Taglianetti will
miss the remainder of the season
with a torn ACL.

But the sophomore’s absence
opens the door for a veteran, red-
shirtjunior Elijah Fields, to ﬁnally
live up to his potential.

. “Elijah is looking forward to
this opportunity,” head coach
Dave Wannstedt said. “Opportu-
nities come in different ways and
at different times for individuals
— his is now?’

. Fields is a former Associated ’

Press Class A Player of the Year
and was a highly coveted recruit

while at Duquesne High School.
" Once at Pitt, discipline issues

‘and off-the—ﬁeld concerns creat-

ed questions about Fields’ future
with the team. In 2007, Fields was
suspended the entire season for a
violation of team policy.

Now, the Panthers need Fields

to play up to his potential and so-
lidify a secondary that is coming
under ﬁre.

V After replacing Taglianetti on
Saturday, Fields responded by
returning a fourthquarter inter-
ception down to the Buffalo two-
yard line.

“I thought [Fields] made a big
play,’_’ Wannstedt said. “For not
getting all the ﬁrst team reps, I
thought he went in and he played
well. I expect him to take thetorch
and move forward.”

Staff Writer

' There’s a reason people love sports.
Maybe you’re an adoring fan. Maybe
you bet on a game. Or, if you watched

Monday Night Football last week, I

it was for what happened downthe
stretch —— with two minutes left on
the clock. ,

All game long the Bills were
steady. Trent Edwards was solid. He
spread the ball around as ﬁve Bills

receivers each had at least two recep- .

- tions. They were winning without

. 'I‘.O. making much of an impact.

On defense, they were more im-
pressive. Tom Brady couldn’t throw
the ball down the field‘ and had to
settle for numerous checkdown
throws and balls underneath.‘ Randy

Moss and Wes Welker got their yards I

-—l 141 and 93, respectively —but
didn’t hurt the Bills secondary with
any big plays. I

And so, with two minutes to go «

(on the road, mind you), the Bills
had a seemingly substantial 24-13‘
lead; But something began to -unfold.
During the last ﬁve minutes, Brady

completed 1'2-of-14 passes. A Bills A

later, the Patriots win the game.
No one can say they were -sur-

prised, because aﬁzer all, it’s the Bills. ‘

But, the general fallout was predict-
able. Nearly everyone on Facebook
and Twitter commented that they
hated the “Pats,” or some other ex-

pression of animosity. People na-_

tionwide were slumped around their

_ televisions ranting futilely about

how the Patriots are evil — not just
Bills fans.

Of course, if you aren’t a Patri-

despise New England. And further-
more, youprobably think that‘Tom

That is the kind of stuff that cham-
pions do — and it doesn’t happen
every day. Most quarterbacks don’t
do something that special in a year,
or even a career.

It’s the same reason you should
have rooted for the Pats to complete
their perfect season a couple years
ago. It could have been the only
chance you’d have in your lifetime
to witness something so unequivo-
cally perfect. _

Most people aren’t great at any-
thing they do. In sports, the air is
more rareﬁed. And since most of us
aren’t professional athletes, the next
best thing we can do is to witness
greatness. Right?

It’s like the Yankees. Everyone
hates them —— but only because they
do it right. They want to compete
and they want to win, so they do all
they can to accomplish those goals.
They use the lack of a salary cap in
Major League Baseballas aresource.
They take advantage of a storied his-

Lewis shines as secondary, kicking struggles

Notebook 4 10

Lewis is the top freshman rusher in the
nation. However, his numbers aren’t just
“good for a freshman.” They put him near
the top of the rankings among all FBS run-
ning backs.

With 44 attempts, Lewis has netted 319
yards and four rushing touchdowns. Only
Purdue sophomore Ralph Bolden and Ari-
zona junior Nic Grigsby have more yardage.
Lewis has also gained 56 yards through the
air and caught one receiving touchdown.

The 85-yard touchdown run that Lewis
broke off in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s
‘game was tied for the ﬁfth-longest run in
Pitt history. David Priestly also had an 85-V
yard score in 2001.

Wannstedt noted how impressed he
was with Lewis during his weekly press
conference. '

“Does he have talent? Yes. But this kid is
ahead of his time, for sure, from a maturity

K standpoint,” he said. “He’s off to a good
"L start, to say the least.” '

Tackling Fuel

One point of concern for the Pitt defense

has to be the number of big plays that were

’ given up during the Buffalo game. In the

second quarter, Buffalo receiver Naaman

Roosevelt scored on pass plays of 54 and
 67 yards.

Most of the success that Buffalo found in '
‘ the secondary can be attributed to subpar

tackling by the Panthers’ defense.

“We just didn’t look as fast as what we
are out there. When the ball was thrown, we
overran things. On the big plays, we lacked

some of the fundamental football skills that

we do week-in—and-week—out and work on
daily,” Wannstedt said.

Fundamentals are always a major point
of emphasis when preparing for Navy and
its triple~option attack. Wannstedt told
reporters that the defense is going to prac-
tice without a football during some drills
to stress the importance of each defensive
player’s assignment.

“On every play, everyone is responsible.

x*‘o, 1

    

   
 

A
C

On every single play someone has to be
accountable for the fullback, quarterback
and pitch,” Wannstedt said.

The Streak is Over

When Dan Hutchins missed a point-
after—touchdow_n in the ﬁrst quarter of
Saturday’s game against Buffalo, it broke
a streak of 120 successfully converted kicks

since 2006. ,

The streak can be contributed to former
Pitt placekicker, Conor Lee, who was ﬂaw-
less in PAT attempts during his career.

Hutchins responded by making his next
twogattempts before missing another PAT
in the third quarter. 4

“We’ve got to make those,” Wannstedt
said. “[Hutchins] just needs to be more
consistent. He can make those, he knows
he can, and he will.”
