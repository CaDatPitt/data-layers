Maps Duties, Aspects
Of Audio-Visual Aides

by ANNE norm .

Reels of tape instead of
library books ﬁll the shelves
of the Regional Instruction-
al Materials Center (RIMC)
located in G-47 of the Ca-
thedral. The one mah best
able to sort outthis library
of audio-visual aids is Ivan G.
Hosack, director of the RIMC of
Allegheny County Schools and
the University.

Hosack manages over 500,000
ﬁlms in the county's largest Re-
gional Center, and “one of the
ﬁrst Centers, serving more
‘teachers and students and fill-
ing m"ore.requests.”

Hosack. who has been teach-
ing at the University since 1955,
has been the director of -the

I RIMC since‘ its beginning in

1960. He helped found the Alle-
gheny County RIMC, one of 25
such region-al centers, while he
was audio-visual aids director
for t-he city schools. When it
was first established, the RIMC
was not in partnership -with the

‘- University, but .Hosack “work-

ed out a_ program by which .the
University could profit from
partnership with the County and
in turn, the_ County could profit
from the University’s partner-
ship.”

In 1961, Hosack related, the
University began working in co-
operation with the RIMC. Ac-
cording to Hosack, the Univers-
ity provides the space, utilities,
maintenance, certain instruction-
al facilities, materials and equip-
ment. The University receives
access to the County’s Film Li-

' gbrary and certain services of

Hosack. '

“The faculty, intern teachers,
and student teachers of the
county and the entire Univers-
it ] can‘ use the library,” explain-
ed Hosack. “I teach some class-
es without added compensation
as a service to the University.
I also have lecture-demonstra-
{ions for various groups of the
the University, such as student
teachers and the nursing facul-
ty.n

Hosack -stated that the RIMC
supplies 43 County schools, the
University, Chatham, and Car-
negie-Mellon University. “The
University in 1966-67 used 2.750
films in _ all its departments.

  

Through the service of the li-
brary, the University saved 16
thousand dollars. I would say
that we've paid our rent.”

Hosaok, a man enthusiastic
about -his ﬁeld, explained the
workings of the RIMC. The of-
fice takes requests for the use
of films and schedules them. He
emphasized that any student
may "come down to preview a
film any time he wishes. Be-
hind a room filled with reels is
an open room where two assist-
ants check the films when they
are retu-rned and prepare them
to go out again.

In the classroom "where Ho-
sack teaches many of his class-

es, he pointed out various audio- _

visual aids which he not only
teaches his students to use, but
also employs in his own teach-
ing techniques. “We try to prac-
tice what we preach. I believe
every teacher should do this.” '

From his years _of service and
his development of the use of
audio-visual aids, last October
Hosack won the Pioneer Award

» from Pennsylvania Learning Re-

sources. Association. More re-
cently in April, he received the
National Audio-Visual Instruc-
tion Pioneer Award.

New Assistant Dean of Men
Outlines Roles of Orientation  

By DOUGLAS STANTON

“Orientation is not just a
three-day shot and then for-
get about it. Orientation
must continue throughout
the entire Freshman year,”
said new Assistant Dean of
Men for Freshman Affairs
William Markus in an inter-
View Wednesday.

Markus, who assumed his du-

ties July 3, stated that the main

problem in the Freshman year
is Orientation. “Students are
here for an education more than
anything else so we should have
an Orientation to knowledge, not
just to social life.”

The new Assistant Dean feels
that social life is important,
“But freshmen now tend to get
a false picture by too much em-
phasis on social life.”

“A student too often may

choose a major by chance — by
reading a brochure or by tak-
ing a course in high school,”
Markus said. “We must intro-
duce him to all knowledge so

that he can choose his major on _
the basis of knowledge of -all —

areas of academic interest.”

“But Orientation is much
more. The Freshman must ad-
just to many things — his room-
mate, hi-s new independence,
new activities. Orientation
should last all year of his prob-
Freshman in all of his prob-
lems,” said Markus.

Markus received a. BA. from_
Baldwin-Wallace College in 1965
in education. After graduation,
he worked for two years as head
of cooperative housing at Indi-
ana University in Bloomington,
while working for his Master of
Science in Higher Education.

“I have also had experience in
residence halls, for I was ad-
visor while an undergraduate,"
added Markus. I

“I would not have come to
Pitt if I had been asked to just
fill another job,” said Markus.
“I am very excited over the po-
tential here for ﬁner student ser-
vices.”

“I was also attracted. to the
University because it is a pres-
tigious institution. Although I
am not in academics, it is still
important to be affiliated with
a quality sohoo ,”  Markus.

So far, Markus has been busy
reading and learning about the
University. “But by the time
school starts in the fall, I hope
to have some of my ideas ironed
out and in action.” '

According to Dean of Men I

Herbert McGibbeny, Markus
was not hired due to any crisis
in Freshman affairs. “Hiring a
person to handle just Freshman
Affairs was an idea of mine to
aid Freshmen more and to or-
ganize all of the services for
them.”

McGibbeny added that he spe-
cifically hired Markus because

he was young. “Students tend‘

to identify the personnel of the
University with their parents.
We hope they can identify more
with Mr. Markus," he said.

The Freshmen may have to
hurry because Markus is mar-
ried and will be a parent in No-
vemlber.

‘Pitt News’ Review

“Best Bond Is

by Robert L. Horowitz

Bond is dead! Long live
the Bond! James Bond is
back. This time, however,’
he's dead; You might say
he went with an oriental
flare. Sean Connery outdoes
himself in the best 007 ﬂick
to date. From the ‘begin-
ning of ‘ the ﬁlm one gets the
feeling that the old James Bond
is back.

In recent films Bond has been
wishy-washy and over emotional

to the point of being human. In

You‘ Only Live Twice Bond is
his old rutheless i-ngenius, ul-

  

tra-suave, unsurpassed, indes-

tructible, conceited self.

Thcugh -t h e concept of «t h i s
ﬁlm is more fantastic than the
other Bond pictures; the act-
ing, photography, and music
save the day. Bond ﬁlms are _not
Works of art, but they are, or
can be, most enjoyable.

Sean Connery comes across
better than ever as the super-
spy of all times. His.character-
ization is sprinkled with just
the right amount of the neces-
sary ingredients. The support-
ing cast is very good, and the
girls are Wonderful to look at.

    

A Dead Bon ”

The script and the direction
hurt the ﬁlm more than help it.
First, the puns and “comic”
lines are like steaks that are
cooked too long, they’re over
done. The direction has its good
moments, especially during the
battle scenes, but these moments
are scarce.

The musical -score and the
photography create a. perfect
setting -as the background for
the plot. The Picturesque Jap-
anese landscape (the film was
shot on location) is beautiful.
The music is not the usual loud
and jazy stuff, yet, it does cap-
ture and blend the spirit of the

orient‘ with the coolness of 007.,

   

A soft, -sweet, orientally, mys-
tical mood is set; yet, the chords
of tension are ever present.

Bond lovers will have a great ‘

time, Twice wi-llhave its critics
who say Bond is different.
They’re correct, Bond is differ-
ent,

terization drawn by the late Ian
Fleming. In Dr. No and From
Russia With Love it was Bond,
the superman, who with the aid

of gadgets was great. In '1‘hun- ;

derball and Goldﬂnger it was
the gadgets that were great. In

You Only Live Twice‘ Bond is

in control again.

-THE prrr NE. S —‘ flirt any. n £34.’   ~ —_

All ‘too many administrators, especially those in the area of stu-
dent affairs, unfortunately earn the reputation of never really dealing
with students withany measure of honesty. They become stereotyped

A in this manner because of the few administrators who do resort to un-

‘fair tactics when dealing with students, with the result of students de-

veloping a wariness and distrust of the University off'icials who directly .

affect. them. . .
Because there are so few administrators who do enjoy the students’

unanimous respect (which is no mean achievement), it is particularly gra-
tifying to welcome Jack Critchfield to his new post as Dean of Student
Affairs. For our new’ Dean of Student Affairs and former Dean of Ad-
missions is that exceptional breed of administrator who is not only uni-
versally respected but also universally liked.

Dean Critchfield’s record at this University marks him" as an ad-
ministrator who recognizes the importance of placing real respect and

confidence in the students. Those students who have had the opportunity '
' tondeal with him are unrestrained in their admiration for him.

Although he has thus far earned an enviable reputation, we are
-"certain Dean Critchfield recognizes that the real challenges lay before
him. Our University is beset with problems that drastically affect our
students, such as the limitation of the number of dormitory students
until the new dorms are completed in a few years. The complexion of

  A and Beginning   

our student body has changed in the past three years, from basically
a dormitory school to a predominance of our commuter population. Stu-
dent activities could beistruck aserious blow because of this develop-
ment.

Students who commute to school are prone to fall in the habit of
coming to the University merely to attend classes and failing to partici-
pate in the numerous activities available. This development has already
resulted in the formation of an elite group of students who hold most
of the major positions. ’ I

As our University expands in number, however, we are also accept-

ing a higher calibre of student, and it is‘ of vital importance that we

benefit from the high standards our Admissions Office maintains.

The dilemma of the former high school leaders who all too fre-
quently become spectators at this University is one problem that Dean
Critchfield is certainly qualified to handle, with his excellent back-
ground in admissions at this University and elsewhere. For student
activities need the wealth of participation that this University has the
potential to provide. ,

Obviously this problem is not an easy one to tackle, nor are the
countless other aspects of Dean Critchfield’s new position. But judg-
ing bypast experience, which must remain our only criterion at present,
he certainly measures up to the task.

 

Unparalleled Incompetence

 The Perils of Transferring Parade of

As is commonly known,
the-University has accepted
a large number of Pennsyl-
vania resident transfer stu-
dents due to the recent great

A , reduction in tuition.

p I am one of them.
But if my experiences

.with the University so far

prove to be typical of the
next two years, I shall prob-

 ably regret.-- my choice to

leave"t“h‘e"“Uril’iversity of
North Carolina.
As a start, I was accept-

fed to the University over

the telephone. That’s right,
you can dial for anything
nowadays.

Later, a letter of Wel-
come arrived in the mail. It
said, “Further instructions
will be sent about registra-
tion and orientation.”

Naturally (or unnatural-
ly?) the ‘further instruc-
tions never arrived. So this
time it was dial——a—regi‘s-
tration. A secretary in the
Advising Center noncha-
lantly informed me that no
one had ever given them the

“F . A" ,_names of the transfer stu-

dents to be notified for reg-

A istration.

. Luckily, I called in time
_to register before the first
seven-week session had
started. But unluckily, most
of the courses I wanted or
‘needed were already filled

up.

by Douglas Stanton

I can only assumethat if
I had not called the Advis-
ing Center myself‘, I would
never have been notified
that classes had even start-
ed. And if I had not regis-
tered —- you guessed it --
Vietnam.

At registration, I was
told to come back the next
day for orientation.

Orientation consisted of i

a representative from the
Dean of Men's Office asking
the question, “Do you have
any questions?” He appar-
ently did not realize that

-questions must have some

factual base. '
After classes had com-
menced, I was safe from
harrassment by the admin-
istration of the University

‘for all I had to do was pay

mybills and attend classes.
Then came the time for
grades. In a move complete-
ly consistent with the here-
tofore golden rule of every-
thing before students, the
Office of Student Records
decided not to notify stu-
dents of‘ their grades until
after the second seven-week
session. After all, who cares
about their grades!
Incansistently, the deci-
sion was later withdrawn.
But once again, they made
a mistake. No grades ever

appeared in my mailbox.
After being told that all

grades had been sent out,

the Office of Student Rec-

ords informed me that I
could request a transcript
of my grades free of charge.

I think that the reasonit
was free of charge is that
they never intended to send
the transcript in the_first
place. For here it is, one
week later, and three weeks
after the end of the last ses-
sion, and still no grades. I
hate to open my mailbox
anymore.

These examples of gross
incompetence are hardly
singular. Countless other
transfer and regular stu-
dents have related similar
examples of negligence to
me. In fact, the main tra-
dition of which I am aware
at the University so far is
one of unparalleled ineffi-
ciency.

This tradition is not a
recent development, either.
Complaints of alumni for
many years back are heard.
In one example, an honor
student was told ten years
ago that he could not regis-
ter — he was told he had
flunked out.

It is no small wonder that
the University has problems
getting donations from some
alumni. After four years
here, there may be more re-
sentment towards this in-
stitution than any other
emotion.

Commuter Bandit Case 1
Publicit  

by Paul Stoller

Attorney Thomas Kerr is again atempting to defend

- the rights of the accused. Kerr, the chairman of the Pitts-

burgh chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) recently protested the handling of William Zeil-
er. Zeiler is suspected of being the notorious "commuter
bandit." ,

Kerr said “the local FBI officials and police are
deluging prospective jurors with information which may
seriously prejudice any opportunity for a fair trial.”

According to Kerr, Zeiler was . . . “paraded before
the assembled cameras of television and newspapers. He
charged that “Zeiler was slowly and deliberately guided
before the cameras” by Ian D. MacLenden, special agent
of the FBI, and Eugene L. Coon, assistant police super-
intendent. f

“Of course, this coverage was displayed at great
length on the evening news programs of the television
media,” Kerr pointed out. Kerr and other spokesmen‘. of
the ACLU pointed out that a number of FBI statements
concerning the suspect (Zeiler) could conceivably preju-
dice a prospective jury. The FBI and the police stated
that Zeiler “bears a close resemblance to the composite pic-
ture of the ‘commuter’ which was widely circulated.”

Kerr's most essential point, however, was that all the
publicity and statements and other actions germain to
the Zeiler case “were done before the accused had any
opportunity to have his case heard in the grand jury.”

The arrest of William Zeiler, of course, was big news.
After all, various law enforcement officials had been try-
ing to crack the case of the “commuter bandit” for nearly
six years. Obviously, with the arrest of the case’s first
suspect, a great deal of publicity should have been ex-
pected. Unfortunately all the necessary precautions were
not taken to insure objectivity.

The problem of unfavorable pre-trial publicity has
always been a great problem in the realm of criminal pro-
ceedings. The Sam Shepperd case, for example, can pro-
vide an example of this problem. Dr. Sheppard, who was
originally convicted for the murder. of his wife, was re-
cently granted a new trial and then set free because it
was judged that he had not received a fair trial. There
was, it was ‘decided, too much prejudicial pre-trial pub-
licity. ‘

It isn’t very hard to assume, moreover, that if Lee
Harvey Oswald had ever been brought to trial, he never
would have received a truly fair trial. When arrested,
Oswald was immediately branded as President ~Kennedy’s
assassin. Yet, even today there is some doubt about the
validity of this claim.

Most likely, many people hold that Zeiler is the “com-
muter bandit.” The press has indeed been careful to lable
Zeiler as a suspect. Even so, if poll or survey were taken,
it would undoubtedly reveal that most people believe in
Zeiler’s guilt.

Like Sheppard and Oswald, Zeiler has been victim to
the treachery of prejudicial pre-trial publicity. As of now,
Zeiler is an innocent man. Yet, will his prospective jury
(which has been subjected to all the publicity concerning
Zeiler) adhere to the principle of “innocent until proven
guilty.” Or, will the prospective jury have pre-conceived
notions as to Zeiler’s guilt?

N 0 one can really answer this question. Yet, it is rea-
sonable to assume that the fairness of Zeiler’s trial has
been jeopardized. In the future law enforcement officials
in -this area should take a more protective attitude towards
suspects of major crimes. ’

Other home "contests are also
scheduled with William and
Mary, a new _opponent and tra-
ditional foes West Virginia and

for home clashes with Air Force
and Army and an away meeting
with Navy. The game with Air
Force will mark the first meet-
ing between _the Panthers and 
the newest service academy,
while Army and Navy are tra-
ditional rivals.

The Air Force game is even
more significant since it follows
so closely on the heelsof the
appointment of former Academy
officer Dr. Wesley Poscar as
Chancellor of the University.
