Life Goes On As Mid-Year Rush
For Pledges Gets Off To
Severely Moderate Start

 

Season TdEnd Sunday

_ By Igor

It.’s morning of February 20.
At 7:59 o’clock quiet envelops
the campus and its environs. The
birds chirp, and here and there a
student softly sings as he beholds
the wonders of mid-winter na-
ture. Though SPURS d09$n’t ﬂu
the air, thoughts are turned in many
(.3585 toward swimming, roller skat-
ing, and mushball.

At 3 o’clock quiet still envelops
the campus and its environs. The

birds still chirp, and here and there ‘

students still sing softly and 0011'
ieinplate nature's beauties.

For today a severely moderated
rusliiiig season officially begins-

Soon some freshmen and upper-
classmen will know new-found frlellds
among the fraters. Maybe later those
same students will be weaflllg Cllte
little pledge badges signiﬁcant of 111-
tended initiation by (3119, of the 1,3
great Greek bodies existing on this
cainpus.

The truth of the matter seems to
be that there are so few new fresli-
men to rush that the season isii’t con-
sidered worth much bother D)’ the
fraternities. , _

It won’t be the hectic whirl _of
dances, smokers, parties, entertain-
ments, and a.ffairs by which even’ Dre‘
vious season has been descrlbed. The
(‘ouncil of Presidents of Social Fra-
ternities has taken steps to cut down
the season from the usual week at
this period to four days, and has limit-
ed each fraternity to the sponsoring
of only one orchestra dance.

There will be dances, smokers, par-
ties, entertainments, and affairs, gen-
erally, on the schedule, it"s true. but
the war cry this time will be "econ-
omy.”

The new freshman class numbers
only about 55 *men,—-and only -16- -of
those’ have ‘signiﬁed intention of
pledging-before they are in school a
year. How many of those 16 will
pledge their ﬁrst semester has not
been estimated.

Seidle Estimates

Speaking of estimates, The News
has been notiﬁed by N. Robert Seidle,
assistant to the dean of men, that he
expects only about 35 men to pledge
this season. In this number will be
a majority of upperclassmen who
have heretofore evaded the pjedging
ceremonies, he believes.

At 2 o’clock Sunday morning, all
ti-ushees will have been bade good night
by the rushers; then theirs to sit
and think the matter over until 5
o’clock the following Wednesday,
when silence period will be’ lifted. As
usual, it will be considered a misde-
meanor for any fraternity ' man to
proposition a rushee after rushing sea-
son officially ends, and before the
silence period is over.

This may be the last time that the
present rushing system will be follow-
ed. CPSF is considering changing
the entire arrangement around for
next fall, and may move the rushing
season into the ﬁrst week of the se-
inester.

CPSF Proposals

3 Accept I-F Constitution, Others
Consider Rush Rules

Monday night, when the 13 men’s
social fraternities gathered for their
regular weekly meetings, two im-
portant documents under _considera-
tion by the Council of Presidents of
Social Fraternities were to be dis-
cussed. and individual and chapter
sentiment on them determined.

One proposal revolved about a re-
port from an Interfraternity Council
constitution committee, headed by
James VVills, C35. The other was the
reportof Henry George, M35, chair-
man of a, rushing rules revision com-
mittee. _

Copies of the tentative constitution
for a new I-F council did not reach
the fraternities in time to be consid-
ered. But, from reports in The Pitt

Cap, Gown Show
Is ‘In The Soup,’
Say Cliristeners

Directors Schedule Preliminary
Tryouts For Musical Show
On Monday -Evening

Cap and Gown is deﬁnitely “In the
Soup.” This announcement of the
name of the new musical comedy,
scheduled to open the week of April
22 at the Nixon, was made yesterday
morning by Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant dean of men and chairman of
the production committee of the Cap
and Gown Graduate club.

Theodore Viehnian and Ruth Miller,
the two cooks who will stir the
sizzling broth of Cap and Gown, have
set 8:45 o'clock Monday evening as the
time for the ﬁrst preliminary tryouts.
The ﬁrst practice, which will be held
at the Y hut, will be designed to give
new applicants :1 chance to learn some
of the routines before the actual
eliminations start.

All men will have a. chance on Mon-

day evening to get any inforination

they desire about the show. They
will also meet the directors and will
ﬁll out the necessary Cap and GOWII
application blanks.

The eliminations for all branches
of the show, the choruses, cast, and
_singing parts, will start in earnest
Tuesday evening at 7:30 o’clock. All
former members of the show who
wish to try out for the new comedy
must be present at this practice. A
ﬁnal and complete list will be taken
at this time of all prospective appli-
cants. All practices will be at the Y
hut.

The ﬁnal eliminations will be made
Wednesday and Thursday evenings
and a ﬁnal list of the members com-
prising the choruses and cast of the
new show will be posted Friday. Mr.
Viehman, director, has to leave for
Cambridge on l\-‘larch 10. "and wants to_
have a complete list of the show mem-
bers before he leaves. Miss Miller
will supervise production during his
absence.

The time of the rehearsals will be

changed . to a late. afternoon _ and even»,

ing schedule, giving dental, engineer-
ing, and pre-medical students who
have late labs a chance to attend.

The weeks from March 1 to April
21 will be given over to learning
routines and dress rehearsals. This
period will also include the Easter
vacation.

Former members of Cap and Gown
will be given little extra considera-
tion by the new directors as both Mr.
Viehman and Miss Miller wish to
make the new show as non-partisan
as possible. This step leaves an open-
ing for new members as there are
more than 60 ingredients needed for
the recipe of “In The Soup."

FERA Workers
Earn Average
Total Of $64. 63

According to ﬁgures just released
by the University FERA oﬂice, 600
FERA workers earned $3,625 during
the month of January. .This brings
the total earnings for the ﬁrst semes-
ter to $37,165.80.

During the ﬁrst semester, 690 stu-

 

. dents worked on FERA, assignments.

The average earning per student con-
tinuously employed was $64.63. These
students thus earned the expected $15
per month in October, November, De-
cember and January. For the whole
group of workers the average earning
was .-$53.86. About 20 other students
were assigned late in January, but on
acount of examinations did not begin
work during the month.

The FERA office has received word
from the State Emergency Relief
Board that work _is to continue during
February. This means that students
who have been assigned to jobs and
have been working on their own re-
sponsibility during the early days of
the month may continue working and
will receive checks for February.

Minor Judiciary Head Will Refute
‘Newspaper Lies’ At Inquiry Today

An innocent, unassuming Pitt News
report of Inquiry is the cause of an-
other forum today at 12:30 o’clock
in Room 107, Alumni hall. Three
weeks ago Attorney William Doty ad-
dressed Inquiry opposing the “squire-
archy.” Today Andrew W. McMillen,
president of the Minor Judiciary and
Constable Association of Western
Pennsylvania, will be here to refute
what he calls “untruths” of the At-
toriiey. He will defendtlie minor
judiciary which he considers “abso-
liitely necessary.”

The speciﬁc statements of Attorney
Doty which aroused Squire McMillen
are those pertaining to the politicians’
inﬂuence on squires and aldermen.
“This has been checked false,” he
said.

According to Mr. McMillen, Mr.
Dotv overestimated the number of
justices of the peace and aldermen in
the county. “There are 270 minor
judicial officers in Allegheny county,

only one-half of whom are active,”
said Squire McMillen. -

Doty said, “A magistrate studying
law is a miracle.” Mclvlillen claims
that many a reputable attorney, prac-
ticing law, is a justice of the peace
or alderman.

A statement was also made by Doty
to the effect that many justices of
the peace and aldermen have never
seen the inside of a law book. The
squire cites himself as an example of
one who has studied law for his own
use. Moreover squires are often con-
sulted lll problems of law, according
to Squire McMillen.

“No single alderman ever made
$25,000 out of 5,000 cases, as was
stated by Doty,” asserted McMillen.

Finally Squire l\/Iclvlillen said that
Attorney-Doty has not appeared in a
justice of peace or alderinaiiic office
more than seven times in his life, and
therefore knows little or nothing
about the workings of the minor
judiciary.

Pitt Players have done better
shows that the Magda which they
presented to the lreiie Kaufmann Set-
tlement audience Sunday night, but
that wasn’t the fault of the actors.
Principally it was the fault of "a slow,
dragging start that put the audience
back on its heels wondering whether
to have a milk shake after the show
or not.

Then little by little things picked
up. The audience began to perceive
that the plot might eventually get
somewhere. They began to take
notice and quiet down when J'ack
.Hanimersc1iniidt let go a few pyro-
technics about -Magda, the usurper of
paternal authority that had taken her
life into her own hands, being no
daughter of his. Apparently this was
all that the listeners needed, for
from then on they were with the ac-
tors, heart and soul. And the actors
responded by stepping a bit out of
the stereotyped amateur types of the
parts to do a little actual living.

Briefly, the plot begins with a fam-
ily headed by an old tyrant of a mil-
itary father wondering what has be-—
come of Magda, his prodigal daughter.
When they ﬁnd through the family
pastor that Magda has become a most
famous operatic singer, and is at that
time singing at the music festival in
their own little town, even the old
Colonel breaks down to welcome her
home. From tlieti on, things happen.
Magda is found to be beautiful and
autocratic, probably inheriting that
from her father. The difficulties sur-
rounding the explanations of her past
life form the center of the remainder
of the plot.

Plans Prepared
For Conference

 

Representatives From State
Colleges. To Attend Parley

Students throughout the state are
making preliminary plans for the sec-
ond intercollegiate conference on gov-
ernment to take place in Harrisburg
,_April 26-28.

15 University students, dealt» with the
formulation of a model constitution.
'On the assumption that the constitu-
tion is in effect, the meeting this
year will make amendments to it. A
body of approximately 200 students
from about 50 institutions will sit in
a unicameral legislature in which rep-
resentation will be proportional to
their representation on committees.

Every college, university and state
teacher's college has been contacted
and local meetings in each vicinity
have begun to discuss and do re-
search. John P. Bracken and Gen-
evieve Blatt are directors. Winston
Mcconkey, C35, is chairman of the
University delegation. All students
interested in"assisting and attending
the convention should contact the
chairman.

Charter members of the conference
are those who attended last year.
Each one of these schools with one
representative each composes the Ex-
ecutive committee.

The original members were: Buck-
nell, Duquesne, Lehigh, Temple, Penn-
sylvania, Carnegie Tech, Pennsylva-
nia College for Women, Dickinson,
Grove -City Teachers college, Juniata,
Lafayette, Mount Mercy, Penn State,
St. Vincent, Seton Hill, Susquehanna,
Swarthmore, Thiel, Elizabethtown,
Washington and Jefferson, Blooms-
burg Teachers college, California
Teachers college, Lock Haven, Miller-
ville Teachers college, Slippery Rock,
Stroudsburg, Westchester, and Ship-
pens-burg State Teachers college.

 

Dr. Silverman Broadcasts

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the chemistry department, spoke on
“Glass—An indispensable factor in
modern civilization” over WJAS yes-
terday at 5 o’clock.

“First made. in Egypt _5,000 years
ago, glass is referred to many times
in the Old Testament and in the
Psalms,” he said. “It was precious to
the ancients because it was not
abundant, because its beauty delight-
ed, and because it was fragile.”

Of the manufacture of glass Dr. Sil-
verman stated, “Today we make it by
melting sandglimestone, and soda ash
together in ﬁre clay pots or tanks at
white heat.”

200 Attend Harlem Hop,
Incomplete Report Shows

 

With over 200 people in attendance
at the Druid Harlem Hop Monday,
Edwin Beachler, C37, dance chairman,
is conﬁdent that some money had
been made, although he declined to
make any deﬁnite statement as to ex-
penses incurred.

There was only one thing lacking
at the Harlem Hop, said the chair-
man, und that was girls. Stags lined
all four sides of the robin-egg blue
ballroom at the University club. In
fact, the stags took up so much room
that the dance floor was crowded, ex-
cept when the “Swinging Aces,”
blasted out a number too hot for the
average dance couple.

Critical Forecast Of Players’ ‘Magda’
Recommends Show To Campus__Toniglit

 

the" old Colonel share honors. the ad-
vantage being slightly in Miss
Rﬂ1)ll2l€‘l'S favor. She is an actress
who must have an excellent future.
Hainiiierschinidt does not sing “Fine
Featliers,” stick-
iiig, rather, to
pure dramatics
in which his tal-
ent is superior.
Alice Elsoii does
nicely with a
minor part. Ruth
Shapiro was ap-
parently nervous
in the ﬁrst part
of the show, but
her comeback
was strong and
convincing. Janet.
Savage played
her part admir-

 

ably, her sharp
tongue being the
Hannah Raphael Omg, touch of

comedy in the show. Robert Beltz,
Joe Sampson, and Jack Wyeth are
good sub-cliaracters. Purposely, we
have left mention of Joe Madden for
last. Joe handled his voice perfectly.
He lacked the ability to convince only
in his slightly wooden actions. How-
ever, it is certain that he can do two
things, play tennis and use his voice
well.

Tonight the Players present the
Campus showing of Magda at. the‘ YM
& VVHA across the street from Heinz
Chapel. For a. nice evening’s enter-
tainment we suggest that you drop in
there. That you will enjoy the show
is certain, that the players will -enjoy
your attendance is just as certain.
That you will see a tragedy well act-
ed by talented students is even more
certain. Magda tonight!

At "Nearby Theater

Science,Travel Featured

The SFA Newsreel theater will
make its debut at the Schenley
theater at 10:40 o’clock this

screening room.

The different sections of the pro-
gram are varied enough to interest
students who are majoring in any-
thing from political science to phys-
ics. The opening reel, an RKO short.
feature, gives a factual and informa-
tional background of conditions in
the Saar district and some stirring
scenes of t.he celebration which took
place in Saarbriieckeii after the re-

da. A Fox Movietone newsreel con-
tains, among other things, a fashion
show staged in a night club setting in
the Rockefeller center, New York.

Besides the purely instructive fea-
tures, there is some comedy which
serves to, round off and balance the
program.

Columbia Conserve President Outlines
Workers’ Management Experiment

 

“College students are less well-
equipped for intelligent participation
in business than the ordinary man,”
asserted VVilliam P. Hapgood, presi-
dent of the Columbia Conserve com-
pany of Indianapolis, at the weekly
luncheon meeting of the YMCA fresh-
man club Monday.

Mr. Hapgood deﬁned his company

"as “an experiment in workers’ owner-

ship and participation in manage-
ment.” In 1917, the owners of the
coinp'1ny—M‘r. Hapgood and his
brother Norman, the editor—decided
to use their business “as a laboratory
in which to experiment with new re-
lations between owners and workers.”
-‘iftef S9Ve1‘€11 years, they decided in
1925 that the workers were entitled
to‘ own the business and thus have
permanent legal control over it. They
arranged that surplus proﬁts were
thenceforth to go to the workers and
be used by them to buy stock in the
company. By June, 1934, the workers
owned 63 per cent of the common

stock, and thus a controlling interest,
in this ﬁrm which did a million dol-
lars’ worth of business last year.

_ The company is run entirely by the
workers, who are not employed only
when there is business, but employed
by the year. They are paid when
sick and when no longer able to work.
The company also has a health pro-
gram which includes medical, dental
and optical care for all workers at
company expense. Married men re-
ceive higher wages than single men,
and married men with children get
highest wages of all. There is no dif-
ference in the rate of pay of men and
women.

“VVe believe in trea.tiiig our people
decently,” the industrial experiiiieiiter
said, “rather than caring entirely for
our machines.”

Mr. Hapgood also addressed Dr.
Francis D. Tyson's class in personnel
management Monday morning, outlin-
ing the history of labor managership
in the Columbia Conserve company.

“business revival” in Addis Ababa.

Dr. Lambie, of the Sudan United
Mission in this African capital, is one
of the long list of University gradu-
ates scattered over the globe.

The sun may set on The Pitt News,
they say, but it can’t ﬁnd a malor
country where Pitt goes begging for
graduates.

Charles Ludlow Livingston, former
University student, is the United
States consul at Elizabethtown, Bar-
bados, VV. I.

Horation Cadwallader Ray, E’12,
bears the ﬂag to Tshikapa, Belgian
Congo, Africa.

Nicholas N. Bouianovsky, BA34,
just out of school, is now with the
Franco-Asiatic bank of Harbin, Man-
churia.

Hufuf, Saudi, Arabia, Bagdad and
Bahrein are some of the strange
places in which Pitt may drop you.

 

 

Forty-one foreign nations, say
Alumni records, are represented.
Canada leads with ‘.29 graduates.

China has 25. India. has 14 and South
America is fourth with 10.

Other sections on the alumni list
are Japan, Java, Rumania, Mexico,
Cuba, Switzerland, Hawaii, Egypt,
Russia and a score of other countries.

Blood Clots and Death

The state of mind cannot possibly
affect blood clots and induce dea.th.

Speaking on psychological causes of
death, Dr. Alfred G. Dietze, assistant
professor of psychology, told The Pitt
News:

“Worry and extreme fear of
course may undermine one’s
health until a breakdown occurs.
Some diseases are hastened or re-
tarded by the state of mind. But
so far as I know, abnormal fear
cannot induce a blood clot or
even affect it in any way.”

Dr. Dietze mentioned the 20-year-old
University coed who died from injur-
ies suffered when she fell after a.
large dog leaped at her and knocked
her down.

 

Orchids to Dr. Tyson

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics, is receiving congratula-
tions today. His prediction of four
weeks ago on the Supreme Court gold
decision was perfect down to the last
judge.

According to Dr. Tyson, the ﬁnal
vote would be 5 to 4 with the follow-

ing judges supporting the adminis-
tration:
Chief Justice Hughes. Cardozo,

Brandeis, Stone and Roberts. He pre-
dicted Sutherland, Butler, McRey-
nolds, and Van DeVanter would op-
pose.
Dr. Tyson won two bets.
said:
“The Supreme Court is like
Caesar's wife -— above suspicion.
“Seriously, though, the decision
was one of the most signiﬁcant
of the 20th century. A negative
decision would ‘have strengthened
the inﬂationists. The increase in
debt burdens would have justiﬁed ‘
artificial price raising to ease the
load.
“I don’t believe there was much
pressure brought to bear on the
court."

A Day In The Routine Of Expensive Hostelry At New
York Reveals Trends Of Higher Living

By Herrymon Maurer

OTEL BLANK, New York City, is a. combination of a. gloriﬁed old per-

sons’ home, a swanky transient resort, and an expeiisive, haven for (lis-
Contents. Last summer my mother and I stopped at the hotel for two days
to visit a great aunt. Aunt Ruth is an appealing elderly lady, aristocratic
but human. In fact, all the old persons in the hotel are cheerful and inter-
esting, The transients are negative. The discontents are amusing.

I went over to the room which Aunt Ruth was sharing with llxlother a
few minutes before dinner. The room was stuffy; I opened the window,

_ fclumsily knocking a pound of butter-—Aunt Ruth prepared. her own break-

fast——to the roof of a lower section of the hotel.

“l’l| just run down and get it for you," I suggested.

“No,” Aunt Ruth said, “the manager wouldn't like someone climbing
out of the window. Unbecoming in a guest, you know. He’s strict about
appearances.”

“Why don’t you ask one of the hotel men to get it for you?” Mother
asked.

“The tip would be more than the price of the butter.”

The pound of quite usable butter remained on the roof.

=I= * i: it

In one corner of the room a middle-aged gentleman of senatorial appear-
ance who completely ﬁlled his chair sat before a. well-spread and completely-
filled table. His head looked like a. billiard ball resting
on an overstuffed pillow. The pillow pushed forward,
the billiard ball inclined itself toward the table; two au-
tomatic stokers appeared and with regular rhythm
stuffed. food into a wide mouth. Broccoli was swung
from plate. to mouth; lamb was sliced, speared, stuifedg
small rolls were engulfed in a bite. Dinner over, the
gentle1nan'leaned back, lit a. cigar, rolled it lusciously
between caressiiig lips.

Somewhere else in the room a woman began to
talk loudly. ‘

“Both she and her husband are a little deaf,” Aunt
Ruth explained.

The woman was niiddle-aged. Her face and ﬁgure be-
trayed vain efforts at improved appearance by dress,
make-up and diet. Her husband had that; senatorial
countenance, too, but he appeared worried; he squirmed
in his chair. ‘Wife rapped noisily with her knife against;
a plate, discoursed loudly about the menus, called for a waiter. They were
ready for dessert.

“Dear, there's cherry pie,” she announced.
“Don’t want cherry pie,” husband grunted. .
“But clear,” she said in decided tones, “it’s cherry pie. Cherry pie.

You like cherry pie.”

“I know I like cherry pie, but I don’t like the way they make it here.”

The woman rapped on the water—pitcher, waved her hand, called loudly
for the head waiter. “How do you make your cherry pie?” Her husband
left the table to purchase a cigar While the head waiter explaind the make-
up of Hotel Blank pie. ’

“I ordered cherry pie for you, clear,” she said decisively when hus-
band returned.
“But I don’t want cherry pie.”
“But you like cherry pie. Cherry pie. lt’s cherry pie.”

The man grunted, and the woman rose to her feet, picked up a pa.rt of
her long skirt and left the room in regal fashion trailed by her husband.

1!! =¥ ‘I: * .

IN AN institution such as Hotel Blank, swanky as it is, there are bound

to be many entertainments. A group of men and women had crowded

themselves into a large room at one end of the long hall to play bridge. In

the room there was silence, a silence so stilted as to be depressing and ener-
vating; there was conscientious observation of all laws of bridge.

At the other end of the hall was the ballroom, ﬁlled this evening by
country—club members in evening dress cavorting in corpulent childishness;
the ladies had all been: poured into gowns designed for very young women,
and their spare ﬂesh overﬂowed around shoulder straps and neck-lines and——-
notwithstanding the corrective effect of foundation ga.rments—-bulged here
and there beneath the dresses.

The men were stiff in tuxedos and, aware of their stiffness, were silly
and childish in their attempts to appear at case. They attempted to be strik-
ing as grea.t actors. They laughed self-consciously, made theatrical gestures,
shouted, raised eyebrows ostentatiously, bowed and kowtowed.

Mother and Aunt Ruth had gone upstairs. I sat in a. chair in the lobby
and watched the antics at the dance. I felt pleasantly superior to these
people that amused me, but nonetheless I wanted to be in the ballroom my-
self. Now if somebody would say to me, “Come on in- and dance,” I would
go in, dance proﬁciently, and show them all.
a. couple drifted down from the bridge-party end of the hall. They glanced
in the direction of the ballroom. The face of the man—he appeared bored
by the bridge—1ighted with interest and desire. The woman, more subtle,

really high-toned amusement.
:0! I? II!

T LENGTH I despaired of joining the dance, and I went to the cigar

stand to buy cigarets. Being slightly insane at the moment, I pur-
chased a 25-cent variety. I opened the package, lit a ci-garet. Stale, it tasted
of dry shoe-polish, but I was too timorous to complain to the clerk.

I entered the elevator. “Do you like this brand of cigarets?” I
asked the operator as he took me to the fourth floor. -

“I like them all right. But I've only smoked them a couple of times.
Too expensive for me.”

“Well,” I began, a little self-consciously, trying to feel all the time
that I was being generous, “I just bought these, but I don't like them.
They taste too sweet. You can have them if you want.” ’

As I got out of the elevator the operator thanked me cordially. But
as I walked down the hall I realized that I had given the cigarets to the
man because they were stale, and that, not being honest with him, I had
tried to make it appear that I objected to them because of their natural
properties, not because I considered them unﬁt to smoke. My pleasant at-
titude of righteousness which I had been building up all evening did not last
long. I could no longer enjoy my attitude of “what difference do classes
make anyhow?” I had given the gentleman something worn out and useless,
and had hoped that he would be impressed by my generosity.

Clark Expands Philosophy Against
‘Glorious Profession’ Of Reformers

By Wilbur D. Clark
If I had more affection for my good

for misunderstanding me. I do be-
lieve in progress. In fact I think that

As I was nourishing my hopes,

tilted hen nose, snipped out “How foolish,” and dragged her husband off to

friend Eddie Banks (he called me a
good friend of his, and be darned if
I can let him get away with that), or
if I knew him only slightly, I would
try to dissuade him from battering
his tired little wings to pieces against
the image in the window pane.

A year or so ago when the newspa-
pers featured, a story about a spider’s
noble efforts to stop a. clock by spin-
ning its web between the hands, I
was on the side of a number of peo-
ple who believed that the Humane so-
ciety should have taken steps to pre-
vent the continuance of the tragedy.
It was with that idea that I wrote the
last column. I think that torch-bean
ers are wasting their time, and even
if they aren’t I wouldn’t want to be
one.

Banks has always seemed to me to
be rather a nice sort of guy, if you
don’t mind too much a logical person,
and so it was considerable of 8. sur-
prise to me that he should ﬂy to the
defense of torch-bearers. Somehow I
had never associated the glorious pro-
fessiou of bearing torches with Eddie,
and it is rather remarkable that I
haven’t, come to think of it now.

I feel that I should thank Banks for
the compliment about my having be-
come a cynic and having based some
belief or other on “philosophical prin-
ciples.” That will make my parents
very proud, and possibly my philo-
sophy prof, too. They thought that I
didn't learn anything from my course
in philosophy, and to be truthful I
didn’t know that I had, either.

But I cannot forgive the gentleman

it is 9. great thing. But I believe that
progress comes about naturally and
inevitably, and I still maintain that

anything that one man says, or writes, '

or does isn’t going to change the ex-
isting order of things, even if Eddie
does think that Father Coughlin is a
swell fellow.

HE CAMPUS is again anticipatiiig

fraLernit_v and sorority rushing,
and as usual, with a variety of emo-
tions. Those being rushed for the
ﬁrsli time are slightly in awe of the
proceedings, and are hopeful. Those
who have expc1‘ienced a rushing
period are either resigned to a sc1'a-D
heap or looking forward to more good
times. The good brothers and sisters
expect both hard work and pleasure.

And there are some, call themselves
what they may, who are out—and—out
scoffers, Cynics of the sort who demol-
ish school spirit and deride ideals. A
famous (lean once said—-—and it was
recentiy——tha.t, “fraternities always

~have been and always will be an in-

tegral part of university and college
life. Fraternities are the natural out-
g.rowth of college conditions; they be-
long to the springtime of life; they
embody the spirit of youth. They rep-
resent the ﬁne ideals of friendship,
loyalty, and brotherhood before. crass
worldlincss has chilled o11r enthusi-
asms, and the dull, drab, _D'I‘a0tiC%3-1 has
stifled our emotions.”

AI; Pitt, fraternities, sororities, and
the organization of womcn’s classes
are the last. bulwarks of Pittsburgh’s
school spirit. They are the ()nly units
that still cheer the University, toast
her. and do things in her honor. They
are the basic foundations upon which
a ﬁner and happier student body will
be o1‘.‘%a11izell. In reference, then, to
the above quotation, we must agree
tliat Greek organizations on campus
have been and will be an integral part
of the Universilty life. VVil:ness 1.0 this
fact is their inﬂuence in activities and
social affairs. Certainly fraternities
are the outgrowth of college life, for
can you fancy a Greek letter frater-
nity outside of college atmosphere‘?
And just as certainly, fraternities are
the embodiment of youth and spirit.

T THE PRESENT time fraterni-
ties are not ﬂawless. The idea
of loyalty is often misinterpreted to
serve as protection for wrongdoing.
The rather romantic secrecy of the
organizations is often used to shield
selﬁshness and license. Many of
tliem have childish ideas of discipline,
such as p-urposing to produce men by
spanking them!

But despite these ﬂaws. fraternities
are holding their own, and on this
campus, retrencliing. That there has
ever been a weakening of the system
is probably due to the lack of admin-
istration and supervision by the
school authorities, who should inter-
cede in financial and cxtreinest poli-
cies. Any factor so important to the
well-being of school affairs should be
carefully fended from deteriora1;ion.

Now tiliat; such supervision is grow-
ing on this canipus, fraternity men
will be able to turn their attention to
less secular affairs. The building of
an esprit do corps within the frater-
nity, within the campus, will be the
outgrowth of better ﬁnancial condi-
tions. More intellectual and social
matters will enrich conversation.
Genuine guidance and help will be of-
fered to the newcomers. Fraternity
brothers will be brothers in more than
name; certainly Pitt. men and women
need the help and interpretation of
others to aid them in ﬁnding pleasant-
ness on this campus. There are more
Opportunities for the present rushees
to ﬁnd valuable help in fraternities
than have been offered to Pittsburgh-
ers for the past. ﬁve years. ’

Panther Basketeers Meet  
Georgetown Five Saturday

 

I-Ioyas Hope To Topple Coach. Carlson’s Team From Top;

Of Eastern Intercollegiate Conference

 

By William K. Trosen
Georgetown cage followers will get. their first glimpse of the
present Eastern Intercollegiate contcrence leaders when the power-
ful Panthers barge into \Vasl1ington, I). (‘.. Satnrdav for an import-
ant conference battle with the Hojras on the Georgetown hardwood

Saturday night. _
Aside from wislnng to cut the
heap, Georgetown is bent on dishi

Patitliers off.’ the top of the league

11;; out revenge to the l,’itt.sb1t1'gl1 -

 

team for the defeats handed them by:

the Panthers last year. Twice lastl
season the Hoyas battled the Pan-;
thers and twice the I-Ioyas drew noth-;
ing but second place 111 thel
skirmishes. The game Saturday will!
be the ﬁrst meeting of the two teams§
this season, the second game sched-5
tiled in Pittsburgh on March 6. .;

Coach Mesnier has found the going,
rough for his Georgetown basketball;
team this season, the Hoyas droppingf
seven of their 13 games to date. In’
the Eastern Intercollegiate conference ‘
the Ho_va;-1 have :1 none-to0—secure grip :
on the Iotu-[11 place position with an;
even split in their four gaines played.g
Tonight, however, Georgetown stands:
a. good chance of hurdling into third,’
place with its conference game with?
Temple. in Philadelphia. A victory over I
the Owls and the game with the Park“
thers provide the Hoy-as with a fine
opportunity to climb in their confer-I
ence standing.

Two Lettermen On Team
At the start of the season Coach.

lvlesmer had only two lettermen, Cap-1
tain Ed Hargaden and Joe Corliss, to,
form the nucleus of his 1 35 varsity;
The inexperience ot‘ the team wasg
evident. in the first showing of the;
Ho_v:;1.s but lately they have given’
signs that they are still a contender,
for the league honors. Tech was top:

pied recently by Georgetown and thei .

Yale team that ended NYU’s brilliant
27-game winning streak also tell be-
fore the up and coming Washington
boys.

In the spots vacated in the lineup
by graduation last year, lilesmer is‘
using three sophomores on his first
string team. Parcells takes care of
the pivot post, Gobeau is new at one‘
oi.‘ the forward positions, and Zola
teams with Joe Corliss at the guards.
At the other forward post is big Ed
Harg:—1den_. whom the New York pa-
pers hailed as the entire Georgetown
offense against. New York 11nive1'sity.
Hargaden, even though his team has
played less conference games than
most. of his conference rivals have,
is among the individual leaders in
the league scoring.

Pitt Lineup Same _

Coach Carlson, who is still raving
over the Panthers’ thrilling win over
Notre Dame last Saturday, will prob-
ably stand pat on his usual starting
lineup against the Hoyas Saturday
night. Skippy Hughes and Ted Roder-
ick will take the ﬂoor as the Panther
forwards and the center position
again will be ﬁlled by the six foot,
ﬁve inch jumping-jack, High Pete
Noon. The two individual standouts
in the Notre Dame thriller, co-captain
Claire Cribbs and Ross Emrick, will
probably be teamed together as the
Panther guards. Five other players,
Slim Wainio, Bill Jesko, Ralph Fergu-
son, Frank Loucks, and Jim Taylor
will make the trip to the Capital City
in case the ﬁrst stringers are unable
to handle those annoying Hoyas.

Trackmen Enter
New York Meet

Wagenhouser, Fleming, Relayers
Seek AMA Championships

Coach Carl Olson‘s crack relay
team will make its second appearance
of the current indoor season in New
York on Saturday when the relayers
invade the Gotham city to participate
in the National Indoor Senior AMA
track and ﬁeld championships. The
runners will leave on Friday morning.

In addition to the four men com-
prising the relay team, Coach Olson
plans to take Arvel Fleming, Panther
sprint star, and Kenny Vvagenhouser,
who last Saturday ran a brilliant two-
mile race which erased Gus.M.oore’s
old record for that distance.

The relay team of Captain Fred
Kiger, Charles Croat, Emmett Mac-
Dollald. and Harold Connelly will at-
tempt to bring back to Pittsburgh a
first place in the 1600-meter relay
event. In the 2900-meter medley re-
lay, Coach Olson plans to use Fleming,
K1881‘, Connelly, and Great or VVagen-
houser. Fleming will in all probabil-
ity Derform in the sprint races, and
Vi agenhouser will run in the distance
events.

In an appearance earlier in the sea-
son at t.he Melrose games, the baton-
passers won their favorite event
against some of the strongest compe-
tition in their class. However, in this
coming meet the lads are likely to
bump 119 against; the relay teams of
Manhattan, Holy Cross, and other ath-
letic club teams which may produce
a new meet record.

1“0l}1' of the men making the trip
contributed to the record-breaking at-
tack on track house marks last Sat-
l11‘d3-Y. Captaln. Kiger accounted for
two new marks in the two-lap and 440-
yard dashes, Fleming made new times
f01' the 50-Yard dash and low hurdles
0011113911.? broke the half-mile record’
and Vv'8.s‘enhouser whose mile record
withstood the assault, added the two-
mile mark to his record

He Was Very Tired

In speaking about the recent Pitt-Notre
Dame cage srame, Doc Carlson tells one about
Claire Cribbs. Cribbs played the full time,
which was plenty long as everyone knows,
and after a Pitt basket C-ribbs dragged him-
self back to his guard post only to remember
that he was supposed to be jumping center.
With an expression of anguish a mile long,
Cribbs trudged the weary ﬁve yards back to
the center position. Such is life. ‘

toward dramatics, and spend every minute possible
studying the drama and playwtiting, in addition to the
work required by my general course. On top of that, I
have a job that takes up three nights a week. So you
can see my time is pretty full. I get tit-ed...feel ‘blue’
sometimes when my energy is at a low ebb. Then a
Camel sure does taste good! It's really swell how Camels
bring me back. Although I smoke them all the time,

Camels have never made me feel nervous."
