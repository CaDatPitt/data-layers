Tribe Sets
Sights for
Panther

By DAVE BULLOCK ..

Miami’s Woody Hayes rolls his
sputtering Model-T onto the Stad-
ium turf tomorrow afternoon intent
on running down the Pitt’s golden
Panther.

Whether the Redskin mentor can
keep his machine from being shaken
apart by the ‘Big Cat’ depends on
\what repairs he and his fellow me-
chanics performed the past week.

Hayes in his first year at the
Ohio school inherited a squad that
had lost only one game in two years,
besides being Sun Bowl champs in
1948 and Mid-American champs last
year. ‘.

With 27 lettermen returning, Miami
was expected to have a top-notch
ball club again. But the Tribe has
taken only one scalp in three engage-
ments this fall.

Miami began the year with a 23-6
decision over Wichita, then bowed
to Virginia, 21-18, and Xavier, 27-19.

Leaky Line Responsible

Hayes attributes his club's de-
feats to a leaky line, and he and
his cohorts have been working hard
trying to patch it up. The enemy
has been scoring too much and the
Redskins have not got the full mile-
age out of their‘ pass throwing T-
quarterback, Mel Olix.

"Mel has been rushed heavily and
the best passer in the world can't
operate unless he has time to pick
out targets,” explains Hayes.

The “Ashtabula Arrow” gained
only 126 yards through the air in
games this fall. In his two previous
years at Miami, he passed for 2,140
yards.

Good Backfield Runners

Operating with Olix in the.back-
field are three good runners in Sam
Wippel at fullback, and Johnny Pont
Jack Bickel at the halfback posts.‘

The line that Hayes has been
weeping about is light except for
the tackles. A 215 poundpsophomore
tackle, Don _Green, has taken the

‘V the play away from another tackle,

Captain Ernest Plank, as the best
defensive linemen. Outside of the
tackles, the Tribe can't boast of
another 200 pounder on the entire
squad.

This will be the second meeting
between the two schools. In 1931,
Jock Sutherland’s Panthers ripped
Miami, 61-0

Cats Prowl
Tonight

Students who believe that a
penny saved is a penny earned”
should purchase their Panther Prowl
tickets at the student desk.,

The tickets are only $3.25 if
purchased before the dance, but
will cost $3.75 at the door.

The Prowl, part of a big weekend
to be climaxed by the Pitt-Miami
game, will be held at West View
danceland. Decorations will follow
a football motif, and prowlers will
will dance in an atmosphere of pen-
nants, footballs, and goalposts.
West View will provide table serv-
ice during the dancing, which is
scheduled from 9 to 1 tonight.

_Lee Kelton’s WJAS staff orches-
tra will furnish the music for the
informal affair.

According to Don Horowitz, pub-
licity manager, the live panther cub
ihgich was to be given away as ya
I rgprize has »disappeared. ‘ ~

MC Elections
To Fill Posts

Candidates are lining up for Men's
Council elections this Tuesday to
fillithe vacancies created by the
resignations of Bob Kauffman, col-
lege senior, and. Ray Maher, who
filled a college junior post.

The internalelections will accept
any college senioror junior’s name
for nomination. However, those stu-.
dents who polled a high number of
votes at last Spring's elections will
be automatically nominated from
the chairman's seat.

Those automatically nominated
are: Larry Brent and Arthur Ragen
for Kauffman’s senior position; Ro-
bert Crum and Henry Syzmanski for
Maher’s junior position.

Howard Greenberger, president‘ of
Men’s Council stressed‘ that while
these four will automatically be
nominated, any student, if he is a
college junior or senior, can be
nominated.

Features New Facilities

A campus ballroom, arts and craft shops, and lunch-meeting-
game rooms are some of the new facilities which willbe made,
available in the-proposed Student Center.

Flora Diemert, Student Congress president, and Don Ewart,
Congress member, announced tentative plans for the new Campus
structure at Congress meeting Monday afternoon.

Miss Diemert and Ewart, along
with 12 other student leaders, met
with Helen ‘P. Rush, deaniof women,
and Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, at a dinner meeting Oct. 5 to
discuss plans for the Student Cen-
ter.

Tenative plans for the 90 x 90
Student Center building call for five
floors, two underground ‘and three
above, to be constructed on the
campus lawn between the Cathed-
ral and Heinz Chapel.

, Ballroom Planned

On the third floor of the campus
addition will be the ballroom, large
enough for 350 couples. The second
story will house work, rehearsal,
and reception rooms, Miss Diemert
revealed. .

A huge lobby, which also could
be used for dancing, and a lounge
will ‘occupy the first floor.

The ground floor plans propose
game and meeting rooms, gymnas-
ium locker room, and a snack bar,
Ewart said.

A tunnel will connect the base-
ments of the Cathedral and the new
Student Center.

Penn Sales

Need Boost

Ticket sales for the Penn game
train trip took a sharp upturn Mon-
day. A total of 22 tickets was sold
on Monday in comparison to the15
sold during the entire first week of
sales. '

Three-hundred tickets must be
sold at Pitt if the reduced rate of
$10.35 for the round trip is to stay
in effect. -

William F. Saalbach, assistant to
the Dean of Men, feels sure that
there will be no trouble in making
the goal if Monday’s‘ sales were in-
dicative. "I think the 22 tickets
sold on Monday are a pretty healthy
sign,” he stated.

The tickets for the train, which
are now on sale at the Student Desk,
do not include the ticket to the game.
An additional $3.90 will buy the
ticket also on‘ sale at the Student
Desk.

The tour train will leave Union
station shortly after midnight Fri-
day, Oct. 28 and arrive in Phila-
delphia 7:30 Saturday morning. The
delphia 7:30 Saturday morning.,'1'he
return trip will leave.Philadelphia
a little before midnight Saturday,
reaching Pittsburgh at 7:30 a.m.
Sunday.

Extras thrown in by the railroad
include a rally at the station, pri-
vate cars for groups who want them,
and a student-selected name for the
train. In addition, Mr. Saalbach re-
ported that the E H M association
has received permission from the
railroad to take along their jalopy,
a familiar sight at home games.

No longer need athletic students
make the long journey to Trees
Gymnasium afoot. Nor will Ells-
worth Center students have to dash
along the streets of Shadyside and
Oakland in an attempt to reach a
class at the Cathedral on time.

 

For now, thanks to Capt. Tom
Hamilton, the University is running
a busline to these distant outposts.

Beginning next Monday, Oct. 17 ,
students may ride free, ‘of charge
from Ellsworth and from the Cathed-2

- ral-to Trees Gym andiback.

Bus to Ease F ootso re Students

A Chevrolet bus purchased by
the University last year, will be
used. The Athletic Department pro-
mises that the Chevy will be on
schedule.

The morning bus schedule follows:

Leave Ellsworth 8:35 a.m.
Leave Cl (5th Ave.) 58:40 a.m.

Leave Trees Gym 9:15 a.m.
Leave Stadium 9:16 a.m.
Leave Cl (5th Ave.) 9:20 a.m.
Arrive Ellsworth 9:25 a.m.

At 9:35 a.m. the bus will leave
Ellsworth again,the same schedule
being repeated every hour until
3:35 p.m. At that time the bus will
shuttle from Ellsworth to the Ca-
thedral to Trees Gym according to
schedule. It will then leave the
Gym at 3:55; the Stadium at 3:56;
and the Cathedral at 4:00 to arrive
atschenley Oval at 4:15.

\

The bus returning from the Oval
at 4:20‘ p.m. to the Cathedral at
4:33; from the Cathedral at 4:35

‘back to the Ovalat 4:50. It makes

its last trip at 6:00, arriving at the
Cathedral at 6:15 p.m. The trip to

to intramural competitors.

Ellsworth 5 minutes before ‘classes,
which begin on the half hour.

The Dean of Men’s office did re-

Ticket sales for the Penn Spec-

dicated, urging greater effort in
promoting the tour by Congre ss
members.

He said the Franklin Field ex-
cursion is in the form of an experi-

.ment to test possibilities for future

tours.

Howard Greenberger, Men’s Coun-

cil representative, suggested flying
a pennant with "Good Luck Pitt"
around Franklin Field during the
game.
, Due to the budget of Student Con-
gress and the unknown cost, no ac-
tion will be taken until Greenberger
checks the costs. '

A motion was carried to look in-
to the possibilities of placing sing-

The Panther Club sponsored a
WPIAL basketball tournament last
spring at Pitt Stadium. Under the
leadership of Lou ‘Bimbo’ Cecconi
and with the cooperation of Capt.
Hamilton and his staff, the tourney
was hailed as highly successful
by city athletic leaders.

This year the club intends to go
even further in planning social
functions for its members and stimu-
lating interest in Pitt athletics in
general.

DentalSchool Offers More
Than Drills to Students

By Shirley Levine

Dent School isn’t all drilling teeth. All you need to be assur-
ed of this fact is take an hour’s visit to Pitt’s Dental School.
Situated on "the Hill,” is the building known as “upper dent
SCh501.” It is here that some 380 dents do most of their work.
However, the dental infirmary is located on O’Hara Street, and the
dental library is in the Old Mellon Institute Building.

arteries, liver and other assorted
parts. The cadavers are well taken
care of. When not in use, they are
kept in an "ice-box” and are hosed
weekly to keep them in condition.

Besides the anatomy lab, there
are pathology, chemistry, and bac-
teriology labs.

Miami Game Brings No Let-up

Delta Sigs
Hand Eps
13.-7 Shock

Delta Sigma Phi’s Green Wave
ipset a bewildered Phi Epsilon Pi
six this week, 13-7.

An over rated Phi Ep squad was
surprised in the second period when
Jim Smyers tossed a 10-yard pass
to Carl Haus who made a diving
catch in the end zone for the TD.
Smyers again passed to Haus for
the extra point.

Blaine Helmer, Delta Sig stand-
out, later raced 19 yards to a touch-
down, for what proved to be the
margin of victory late in the fourth
quarter.

With three minutes remaining the
Phi Eps pulled a razzle dazzle play
which averted a white wash. Start-
ing on his 19, Curly Weitz lateraled
to Joe Myles who threw a twenty
yard aerial to Cyril We‘cht who lat-
eraled to Cﬁrly Weitz who ran the
remaining 40 yards for atouchdown.
Weitz passed to Myles for the extra
point.

Phi Ep expected a breather, in
anticipation of their coming grudge
battle with Pi Lam, but the deter-
mined Delta Sigs proved too much
to handle.

Eagles Coast In

Although the YMCA office is only
on the eighth floor of the Cathedral,
the YMCA Eagles are sitting on
top of the world after turning back
the Newman Club, 32"0, at the
Schenley Oval on Tuesday.

It marked their second decision
win'of the season, having scored
a 24-6 victory last week.

The Y charged through to vic-
tory last week on the accurate pass-
ing arm of Mario Mancini who threw
five touchdown passes.

Bill Melnick and Lennie Palmer
scored twice and Paul Turasak
also gathered in a touchdown pass.
Melnick and Palmer tacked on the
two extra points on passes from

Mancini.

Phi Delta Theta won its third
game of the season on Tuesday,
1'5-O, over Alpha Phi Delta to re-
main undefeated.

Dimunitive Chub Beatty tossed
a 40-yard touchdown pass to Jim
Stopford late in the first quarter
for the first score.

Stopford added two more points
to the Phi Delt cause by blocking
a punt in the Alpha Phi Delta end
zone early in the second quarter.

The final score was made on a
15 yard pass from Larry Brent to
Beatty. Brent passed to Beatty for
the extra point.

New Inducements Offeied
To Intramural Officials

Intramural athletic contests stand to get the best officiating avail-
able this year. The Pitt Officials Association has come through with a
plan which would offerrecord-breaking inducements to draw students

into officiating work.

This marks the second consecu-
tive year that the embryonic POA
is furnishing arbiters for IM games.

Trophies Furnished

Hourly wages for officials have
been raised this fall, and a system
of trophy awards has been set up.
The most competent officials in
each sport will be singled out to
receive the cups. ~

Officials will be rated according
to set standards. And the ratings
will be made by participants in the
athletic contests. The POA hopes
that, in this manner, the officials
will be kept on their toes.

War on Boos ,

Leo Bemis, sponsor ' of the
group, and Sam Shapiro, its head,
are hoping, moreover, that the us-
ually abundant boos from specta-
tors will wilt substantially.

The experience gained in offic-
iating IM games is expected to
prove valuable in establishing out-
side contacts and getting outside
work. All preliminary basketball
games at the Stadium will be hand-
led by POA members, the best of
them being picked for the iobs.

Torrid Heat, Then Showers

Makes Practices Rugged

By JOHN MEGELLA

Everybody thinks that the competition for Mike Milligan’s Pan‘ .3-

thers tomorrow,Miami U, is in keeping with the University of Pitts-
burg’s observance of High School Day. That is everybody but
Milligan, his assistants, and the team.

to defeat the Red M1 H33"
and white of Miami. Practice ses-
sions lasted long after dark.
Midweek practices found the erst-
while panting Panthers working out
in a soaking rain. The Redskins
aren't being regarded as pushovers.
The Panthers, who had everything
but Dud DeGroot’s bird egg collec-
tion thrown at them last week by
the Mounties, are primed to handle
any Ohio version of razzle-dazzle
that the Tribe may attempt. Incident-
ally, Coach Woody Hayes, a T ad-
vocate, is considered a budding
DeGroot in his own football circles.

Scoring Threat

Assistant Coach, Ed Shedloskey,
who scouted Miami last week, re-
ports that the Redskin game
shouldn't be considered a “breath-
er” because the enemy has the
speed and ability to score often.
With this in mind, the Pitts are set
to stop the passing of Mel Olix and
the end sweeps of John Pont.

Still on Trainer Howard Waite’s
injured list are End Earl Sumpter,
Tackle Flint Greene, and Guard
Charley Thomas.

CARL DEPASQUA has completed
five or six passes good for 54 yards
in the three games played this fall.

24 Candidates

Basketball practice got under

‘way this week with steady work-

outs taking place at the Stadium
pavilion. Some 24 candidates are
competing for varsity jobs.

Head Coach H. C. Carlson is

conducting drills on Mondays, Tues-_ 

days, Thursdays, and Fridays from
4 to 6 p.m. When there is no Satur-
day football game in town,the Doc-
tor gives his boys Friday off so
the out-of-towners can get an early
start home for the weekend. -
Of the 24 candidates, approxi-

' mately eight are holdover varsity 

men, six are from last year's frosh
squad, and ten are newcomer§.

Practice and tryouts for the‘
freshman team begin Nov. 7. The
only difference between frosh and
varsity routine will be the hours.
Frosh will drill from 2:30 to 4 p.m.

Rules Clinic

Discussion of controversial foot-

ball rules will be the main theme

of the football clinic on Tuesday(

Panthers Get
New Worry

g- A new worry is developing for
Mike Milligan’s football team. The
worry’s name is Dick Gregory.
He's a halfback on the Minne-
sota team which Pitt faces later
this season. Early reports had it
that the Panthers would only have
to worry about Tailback Billy Bye
when the Gophers are on offense.
They were not supposed to have
anyone else worth mentioning.
Now, however, matters
changed. 2
Last week against Northwestern
Bye was hurt in the first half, and
the untested Gregory was sent in
to replace him. The scrub played
sensationally, nettingil66 yards in
18 carries. That’s an average of
9.2 yards per try.
Coach Bernie Bierman was pleased
with his showing, of course, but he

The University Building Fund
Campaign Committee will start the
the shovels digging early next spring
to begin construction on the initial
developement of the 312,700,000
Pitt building program. I

According to campaign chairman
Alan M.’ Scaife, the first ground-
breaking will be on the site of the
Nurses Residence of the proposed
Medical Center. V

He said, "We look toward this
critically needed structure becoming
an actuality during 1950.” Formerly
a separate project, the Nurses Resi-
dence was merged with the general
University program last September
when it was decided that the needed
money could be raised more easily
under the consolidation.

At a meeting ofthe committee last
week, construction bids on the ori-
ginal plans drawn up by architects
Ingham, Boyd, 8.‘ Pratt were examined.
It was then decided that the costs
of construction and _equipment would
exceed the funds available. _

Accordingly new plans will be
laid for residence and social facil-
itiesfor 650 nurses. With five years
of research already behind the plan-
ners it is expected that the new~
blueprints willibe completed in re-
cord time.

The building fund now stands at
$7,514,148.

Adds Twist

The Owl staff has introduced a
new twist to its selling campaign
with the mailing of advertising cir-
culars to all juniors and seniors
and some freshmen.

Each circular will have a short
resume of what the 1950 Owl will
contain, together with sample photos
and an explanation of the production
costs that will raise the price to
$6.00 on Oct. 21. A

In addition to the circular there
will be a reply envelope to enable
the students to order through the
mails before the raise goes into
effect.

Owl staff members originated the
circular campaign during the summer
as a direct result of the advertising
classes offered by the University.

During 1950 the Owl will join the
Pitt News and the Panther in switch-
ing to the lithograph method of print-
ing. The new photégraphefs will be
Delma Studios of New York.

An Owl purchase will be an ex-
ample of reciprocal trade, for each
‘buyer’s photo goes in the yearbook
free of charge.

Last day for the reduced rate on
the 1950 Owl will be Oct. 21, after.
which the price will revert to the
original $5. V

Portraits for the Qwl will be,
taken in the Schenley room, start-
ing Oct. 17, on the first floor of
the Cathedral. Make applications
at the Student Desk as soon as
possible. ‘

of the Cathedral being destroyed by fire are mighty slim, if not
‘non-existant. Pitt is not only fire proof, but it has an excellent

to be doubly safe.

Constructed of stone, cement, and steel, Pitt -is from the
J ground up a fortress against flame. The doors (specially those

to record and file rooms) are built
to prevent the spread of flames.

The elevators, always a hazard
due to drafts, are kept clean. Stair-
wells are closed at each floor.

The electric wiring is installed
according to the national code and
the Board of Fire Underwriters. All
building services such as gas, water,
and heating meet the city and state
codes.

Extinguishers and Pumps

And then, because the University
isn’t content with “well enough,”
it has seventy fire cabinets placed
at strategic points throughout the
building. Each cabinet contains an
extinguisher that is recharged every
October and about a hundred feet
of hose.

Since the city can pump water no
higher than the fifth floor, the Uni-
versity has its own reservoir, con-
taining 10,000 gallons of water, and
a pump system. In case of fire, the
pump would automatically deliver

water to a tank on the. 39th floor at’

the rate of 750 gallons per minute.
From there it would gravitate to
the floors where it was needed. The
tanks are always full and ready for
action.

Quick Fire Reports .

The American District Telegraph
boxes are another safety measure.
(‘Note the little red box to the right
of the main bulletin board.) If there
were a fire an alarm would auto-
matically be transmitted to the
A.D.T . office downtown which would
in turn call the fire department.

Just in case all these precautions
fail, the exits are clearly marked,
so that the school just won't give
in to fire.

The danger of diabetes lies in
the effect of a lack of nourishment
on the organs of the body. Un-
treated diabetics often develop cata-
racts and other eye complaints,kid-
ney trouble, hardening of the arter-
ies, including those of the heart,
and gangrene.

The American Diabetes Associ-
ation estimates that there are ap-
proximately 1,000,000 unknown
diabetics in the United States. This
figure was arrived at using the per-
centage figures of a New England
doctor who tested his entire town.

Bringing that figure down to Pitt's
large student body, it means that ap-
proximately 200 Pitt students are
diabetics and don't know it.

Gets Pan
Hel Event

Panhellenic Council has switch-
ed to the Tuck Shop.

Criticism of last year's formal
Commons Room reception for fresh-
man women brought about a change
of scene for the traditional event
scheduled for tomorrow from 7 p.m.
to 9 p.m.

The committee, headed by Vice-
President Miriam McCauley, has
attempted to carry out the recom-
mendations for informality made by
discussion groups at the Panhel-
lenic workshab last spring. Trans-
ferring the affair to a candle-lit
Blue Tuck Shop was the first step.

Each of the 10 large booths will
be decorated with a different color.
When a guest arrives, she will
receive a" ribbon to match the color
ofone of the booths.Sorority women
will also go to booths correspond-
ing to the color of their ribbons.

All sororities will be represented
in every booth. Rushing will be
impossible under such a system
since the freshmen will meet, girls
from all sororities rather than from
just one. ,

Miriam McCauley stresses. that
this is not a rushing event. The
reception introduces the sorority
women of the University to the
freshmen and transfers as members
of a large group, Panhellenic,
rather than as members of specific
