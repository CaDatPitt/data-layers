Ford Proposes A
Immediate Aid .
 Cambodia

WASHINGTON AP — Declaring
“Time is running out,”A President
Ford warned Thursday night that
Congress must vote emergency
military aid within two weeks if
Cambodia is to survive the current
Communist offensive.

\ In a nationally televised and

 '-roadcast news conference, Ford

hinted for the first time he was
willing to see Lon Nol step asideas
Cambodia’s president in order" to
spur negotiations and end what he
called “an unbelievable HOR-

‘ ROR STORY.“ _i ~

“If we don’t give the aid, there is
no hope” and Cambodia would fall
under Communist control, Ford
said. “If we do get the necessary
legislation from Congress and it

— comes quickly...within the next 10

days or two weeks, I believe there
is a hope...”

The deteriorating situation in
Cambodia, where the capital of
Phnom Penh is surrounded by
Communist insurgents, dominated
Ford’s _news conference.

\ When asked whether he would
ask Lon Nol to resign to‘ help
negotiate a settlement, Ford re-
plied he did not feel it proper to ask
that of the head ofanother state. -

Lon Nol, who overthrew Prince

Sinhanouk in 1970, has been the

major stumbling block to the

opening of negotiations since the

Communists have refused to go to

the table as long as he remains in

office. ‘

visiting American congress mem-
bers last weekend he might be
willing to step aside if that would

Legislation allowing middle-in-
come parents or students to take a
$2,000 tax deduction for education-
al costs was introduced in the US
Senate Tuesday by Senator Hugh
Scott" (R-PA).

Under _Scott’s proposal, students
or their parents earning under
$25,500 yearly would be eligible to
take the deduction for post-s'econd-
ary education expenses’.

Scott’s legislative assistant, Tracy
Mullin, was = conﬁdent the _bill
would receive strong support.

“With inﬂation and rising costs
the way they are, I think it has a

good chance,” Mullin said yester- \

day.

“The prospects get better every
‘time we introduce it,” Scott has
introduced similar proposals in the
Senate yearly since 1958, but all
have been defeated.

Letters have been sent by Scott’s
office to "the individual Senate
members inviting them to co-spon-
sor the bill, she said.

Mullinadded the possibility exists
the legislation could be offered as
an amendment to a different tax
bill. “We will settle for anything
that will help,” she said.

She said she was uncertain when
any sort of a vote. would be taken.

In a prepared release, Scott .\said

Free classes on taking and

workshop coordinator ‘Sylvia New-

“We established these classes in
response to students who came into
the Workshop and requested‘ help
on writing essay answers. It's
difficult to organize an answer so

Starting tomorrow, Pitt’s 38 frat-
ernities and sororities will sponsor
Greek Week, nine days of events in
a culmination of collective efforts
\by Greeks to raise money for the
Western Pennsylvania I-Ieart Asso-
ciation. ’

“Every year we interview ‘various
charities,” said Ed Reifenstahl,
president of the Inter-fraternity
Council. “The main attraction of
the Heart Association was the
promise money raised would be
given back to the University for
heart_ research.” This year, Pitt
Greeks hope to raise $25,000 for
-the charity, Reifenstahl said.

“Greek Week is one of the
Greek’s major social and civic
functions of the year. Fraternities
and sororities get together to work
toward common goals.” It's also

time to have fun, Reifenstahl said,

and relieve the stress of putting a

Jim Flaherty

Mayor's Broth

. BY KEN GORMLEY

If Jim Flaherty decides to run for
county commissioner, the fact he is
the brother of Pittsburgh’s mayor
Pete Flaherty may do him more
harm at the polls than good. «

/"“?,T___. Presently an attorney in a down-

‘idisadvantages to have the name

'1

«

town law firm, and acting chairman
of the Public Auditorium Authority,
Flaherty said he is seriously con-
sidering the bid for one of the three
County Commissionerposts. '

But he sees an “uphill climb”
ahead if he is to unseat incumbent
commissioners Leonard C. Staisey
and Thomas J. Foerstor in the
Democratic primary.

Part of this uphill climb will be '

dealing with allegations by the
opposition that he is unfairly trying
to capitalize on his brother’s repu-
tation, the Mayor’s borther said.
But he is certain the voters will
realize there are advantages and

Flaherty.

“I doubt that being the Mayor’s
brother will give me an unfair
advantage over the other candi-
dates. I feel the two incumbent

county commissioners have a ton of '

money, their incumbent postions,
and an access to the news media in‘
their favor,” Flaherty explained.
He added people might vote
against him because they think he
is trying to get into office on his
brgther’s coat-tails.
All of these facts together, Fla-
herty said, indicated he would
probably be an “underdog” in the

 race for county commissioner, ra-

ther than having any politically
unfair advantages.

A Clerk of County Courts, Robert N.
Peirce Jr., who. has announced his
candidacy for. the GOP slot for

 

county commissioner along with
current minorityvciommissioner, Dr.‘
William Hunt, has no complaints
about the Mayor’s brother running
for office.

“Of course ‘Jim_F1aherty would
have a tremendous advantage be-
cause he is the Mayor’s brother,”
Peirce told reporters at a news
conference at Pitt. ,“But one dis-
advantage of being a relative of a
prominent figure is that people say
‘you’re not doing it on your own.”’

This reaction, he said, could cost
Flaherty a lot of votes. And the
Clerk of Courts felt if Flaherty was
elected in the primary, he would

:24

have to face this issue more than ,

ever as the fall’ elections drew

nearer.

“I see nothing unethical about
Jim running,” Peirce later told the
Pitt News. “But it is a legitimate
campaign issue. He could ride into
office on Mayor Flaherty’s popu-
larity.” .-

Peirce admitted the combination
of Hunt, Peirce, and Flaherty as
County Commissioners would be a
productive one, but he refused to
endorse any one Democratic candi-
date for minority commissioner.

I don’t think it would be appropri-
ate,” he insisted. ‘‘I might be
giving that person a vote that
would go to Dr. Hunt.”

with Commissioner Foerster, also
feels Flaherty will have little or no
advantage because of his name.
“Mr. Foerster and I took the
position - we don’t have a choice
who runs against us, but on the
issues we are prepared to meet
anyone. Flaherty may have a high
recognition factor, but he will be no
different than any other candidates
when it comes time for a debate.”
Satisey said he saw nothing
unethical about Flaherty running

» for office, but he did think the

voters might.

extend his political inﬂuence by
running his brother for County

This year Pitt Greeks have been

“These seats will be on the second

Reifenstahl said that Greek’ Week

Linda Solodar deserve a lot of
credit. “They’ve done a helluva
job.”

' explained, “but the day -of the

The Commissioner pointed _out -

brother who is a mayor. _ ' .
Staisey concluded Jim Flaherty.?
was all talk, and should be “run-‘
ning for the head of the ‘ Boy‘ 7

It is expected Flaherty, a 1959 ,
graduate of Pitt Law School, will“
announce his candidacy for County 
Commissioner in the very near‘-ff
future, with former mayor of»-
Wilkinsburgh and Liquor Control A
Board head, Alexander Jaffurs, as ]
a running mate. , I ,
If Flaherty is successful in the;
election, he said his primary con- _i
cern will be to bring efﬁcient,‘
people into County government
who will cut back on wasted“
expenditures, as his brother Petew,
did with the city government. I p ,
“My starting goal would be to, .
introduce some economy into 
County Government. The County f
budget has risen 125% during the
Staisey, Foerster administration,’,’]_ f
he said “while the city budget has I
only\. 18% in that same period’ of
time.” i I .
The Mayor’s brother said he.’-
would locate the sources of those,

     
  
 

and replace those responsible for’:
wasting taxpayers’ money with
more qualified personnel.

experience and the opinions of"

would make all_of his decisions
himself. ”

Higher education has taken it with a grain of salt for too long.
Recessions and inﬂations have always hit human services first an
hardest, and it comes as no surprise that tuition increases have become

.Since the bill applies to students enrolled both in colleges and

Students Unaware

of Present Options

Dear Editor:

Your editorial of February 26
raises some pertinent issues and
they are likely to be with us for
some time. While it is perhaps
unfair to always face the issues
within the old dichotomy of “liberal
education for the whole person”
and “vocational training for those
seeking jobs,” the problems facing
students compel them to raise the
questions.

‘My concern here is you and many
others may not-be fully aware of the
“options” which may already

Pomp and Circumstance Abroad I I

BY TOM WASELESKI

One would scarcely consider a
secretary of state a foreign policy
issue. Yet Henry Kissinger’s
ever-presence in international af-
fairs is certainly a reason for the
stagnation that plagues most nego-
tiating tables these days.

Not that I would try. to take his
Peace Prize away from him. I just
never would have given it to him in
the first place. One year after the
Kissinger peace came to Vietnam
approximately 75,000 on both sides
have died—celebrating the arm-
istice, I suppose.

The man is considered a demi-god
in his field. His word is indisput-
able and he has a free rein‘ to
personally handle every’- trouble '
‘spot inthe world. And God help
any heathen doubters of the Might
and the Right. ‘ v
« Mr. Kissinger’s chief tactic,
“shuttle dip_lomacy,’.’ connotes a
very vigorous, ongoing series of
negotiatory excursions. The war-
ring parties never have to_meet
face-to-face. Peace by mail. The
ultimate Candygram, like sending
sweets to the sweet. Messenger
Henry stands at Israeli Premier
Rabin’s doorstep with the heart-_
shaped box:

The -cold issues and hard con-
sequences involved -in the Middle
East are too potentially explosive to
be handled in such a namby-pamby
fashion. Time is short, so are
tempers. Fingers are itchy for a
ﬁght, yet Kissinger stalls.
“shuttle diplomacy” is no. strategy

exist,<but which hardly ever are
used. -Unless I am mistaken, it is
possible for CAS Students to

directlyenter one or more. of the '

_University’s professional schools in
their senior year, thus effecting
some combination of the “liberal”
and the “professional.” Carried to
its logical conclusion, this permits
(as happensvat some universities) a
student to earn two degrees in ﬁve
years.

The overall structure of the Uni-
versity clearly divides the “discip--
lines” and the “professions.” This
makes it a bit difﬁcult to deal with
the issues you raise, but my
immediate question remains. Why
is there not a greater awareness of
the options already on the books?

Attack on Hunger

To the Editor,

Were you ever broke_ or lost for
money, in_ such _a way that you
really felt forlorn? Because of
your heavy, everyday cumbersome
problems, has it ever seemed as if
no one could have had it worse?
Well, one out of three children born
in the world-today suffers from
permanent physical or mental im-
pairment due to malnutrition. How
does that hit you? ‘ V

at all. It is buying time so the
Israelis can replenish their stores of
American arms. If something
clicks in the meantime, good—if
not, we continue to “shuttle.”

Pressure is increasing on Super
K, however, to move the bargain-
ing to its rightful place in Geneva,
where all nations involved will be
able to confront each other directly.

It appears the Shuttle Shufﬂe has
gone kapiut, and I expect to hear
any day now from the Secretary of
State that we have been so success-
ful in these missions that we can
now move into the more advanced
stages of negotiation at Geneva.
A_nd Americans will love him for it.

The issues in the “shuttle” will be
the same issues at Geneva: Israel
as set up by the United Nations
three decades ago is still Israel, the
Arab states are still the Arab state,
and the invasions of one into the
other must end. If peace comes,
these will be the terms of the final
settlement. No one observing the
Mideast situation objectively can
deny this.

. So what was the good of “shuttle
diplomacy?” Merely much ado
about nothing. And the irony of the
situation lies in Mr. Kissinger’s

V refusal of criticism. According to

him, Congress is undercutting his
effectiveness by constantly ques-
tioning his actions. ‘President
Nixon ‘wasn’t beyond questioning,
the CIA isn’t beyond questioning,

. ‘and Henry Kissinger isn’t beyond ‘
questioning—even if he decides to,

quit, take his ball, and go home.
His‘ desperate cries for military
aid to Cambodia stem from efforts
to save his own diplomatic skin. If
Congress refuses to» appropriate
funds for military hardware, they
will be forced to accept the blame

strongly supports this worthwhile
effort, and urges students to get
involved in this self-denial act.

‘ Through fasting, _ we .can . exper-
ience ;what is like to be without

"food, a very real situation in much
of the world today. . -

Since about 80% of the student;

congregation ' at, the Belleﬁeld
Presbyterian Church comes from
our campus, we feel that the
largest support of this fast should
come from Pitt. Students who will
fast, or make a pledge for each

. hour that someone else goes with-

out food, will become more aware
of the suffering millions, while
simultaneously helping to cure the
problem in a. supportive atmos-
phere of sacriﬁce." The‘ money

tein foods, seeds, tools, and farm

people of good will can’work to help

CROP is an effective organization,
but it needs the help of students in
attacking this enemy--mass starva-
tion. For more information, please

Office, 305 Student Union, or go

.CROP,

for Cambodia’s fall.. In supplying
arms to the Cambodians no one will
realize the full effect of Kissinger
and Nixon’s fatal decision to invade
the country in 1970, imposing war
on a once peaceful nation. The
Cambodians are suffering more at
the hands of malnutrition that at
the bayonets of the insurgents, as
Henry Kissinger shines on.....

What all this means to the other
members of the world community,
particularly. American allies, is
becoming quite clear. Not only has
the Third World rejected the
leadership of the United States
once and for all by their showing at
the United Nations, but even our
allies seldom ‘behave the way we
would like them to.

Israel is none too justifiable in its
emptying of Egyptain oil ﬁelds,
which now account for 55% of the
Israelis’ oil. The Greeks and the

Turks refuse to resolve the Cyprus,

question, and both President Thieu
of South Vietnam and President
Park of South Korea continue to
repress opposition parties ‘/and
media.

Despite the acclaim Mr. Kissinger
has received in allegedly embark-
ing on a new era in American
foreign policy, this country is
insufferably impotent in its deal-
ings with the so-called Free World.

Pitt Programming
Defends Ziegler
To the editor, H ~ ‘
= I am writing in relation to a recent
article and letter in the Pitt News

concerning a statement that

Ziegler’s appearance at the Uni-

_ versity. This statement read, “We

really wanted to bring\him in.
.Mostly because of all the hassles
it’s created so.far.”

Ifeel that this is a misquote and it
certainly does not reflect the
committee’s "intentions when they
decided to postpone the Ziegler
lecture until March 25, 1975. The
meaning I intended to convey is
that the committee still plans to

 """"""l""l"""'"""""""""""'"'""""'I""'““""'"""""""""'l"li_, 

hold the program, partly because of I

all the work and effort that was put
into enabling Mr. Ziegler to. come

’ to speak at the University.

We want to have the program,
whether it be in February or
March, because we feel that Mr.

Ziegler has a relevant contribution '

to make on the topic, “Between
President and Press.” To deny
him the right to voice his views,
however controversial, in so liberal
and educational a climate as an
institution of higher learning, is an
act of hypocrisy. And lastly,
speaking -from a programming
perspective, the committee feels
that Mr. Ziegler’s lecture would

 

{ 

had allegedly made about Ronald

offer a unique experience to thexegr

student body, as well as an
informative and thought provoking
program. -

tion of learning for the best

provide for the students quality
educators. Dr. William Kadunce is

‘such an educator; in‘ mine and

many other people’s opinions. As a
teacher of organic chemistry and of
introductory chemistry, Dr.
Kadunce has demonstrated the
ability to convey to the student in
the best possible way‘ his know-

patient man and the atmosphere in
his classroom is very conducive to
learning. I therefore feel that he
should be allowed to retain his
teaching position at the University.
the present time, Dr.
Kadunce’s contract will be running
out in the next few months. The
tenure system at the University is
founded on the time-aged saying
“Publish or Perish.” Educators

teach on the campus, he must also
do research which could detract
from his ability to be an effective
educator for he could possibly be
more interested in research than in
teaching. When a professor comes
along who demonstrates he has the
desire and the ability to teach, I
feel he should have the right and
the blessing of the University to
pursue his desires.

Many might say that the
University should put the weight on
research for that is the only way
that they can receive funds and
prestige. However,
University’s job is to educate
students, which I feel is its main
responsibility, it ~ should retain

quality professors just for the.
purpose of teaching.

I would like to ask all of the
interested students taking the time
and effort to read this letter to, if
they feel the same way as I do, help
me and others retain the teaching
services of Dr. William Kadunce.
It can be done in one of two ways.
There is a petition in Room 104 of
the Student Union which’those who
know Dr.~ Kadunce either on a
personal level or as an educator are
urged to sign as soon as possible. I
would also like to ask that if you
feel the same way I do on the
question of research versus teach-
ing that you write a letter to Dean
Marshall, Dean Rosenberg and to

any other administrator that might
aid in keeping various outstanding
professors on this campus.

in Italy, in the 1800's a
poor priest met a boy of the
— streets. At that time there were
thousands of such boys in
Turin . . . hungry, homeless and
without hope.
, But what could one priest
do? Without money. Without
Lsupport. Without even a
building to house them.

But Father John Bosco did make a difference. He founded
the first community that was dedicated primarily to youth. With
a program of play, learn and pray he brought the boys from the

streets back to God and gave them

a means of earning their

p living. From such humble beginnings a movement began that
. ; , now reaches around the world . . . a movement that has touched

St. John Bosco.

with 75% or more high school
graduate residency were for the
most part the same ones where
median family income was $15,000
or more. These tracts included the
Allegheny Center area, downtown
and portions of Oakland and
Squirrel Hill.

Families with annual incomes
below $5,000 comprised 22% of
Pittsburgh's population, but only
12% of the rest of Allegheny
County’s. Thirty-seven per cent of
the city's families fell in the $5,000
to $9,999 range and only 4.3%
had incomes over $25,000. The
median family income for the city
as a whole was $8,800 in 1970, up
from $5,605 in 1960. Median
family income of the US central
cities grouping was $9,519 in the
last census. (Pittsburgh ranked

near the bottom--42 of the nation’s'

50 largest cities--in median family
income)‘.

A More than 11% of Pittsburgh

families had incomes below the
federal poverty level ($3,743 for a
family of four), and 44% of these
had a woman as head of the
household and children under 18.
One of every four persons 65 or
older was classified as poor.

Between 1950 and 1970 women
increased their participation from
30% to 40% of the labor force in
the city though they were predom-
inantly employed in clerical and
related positions. However, their
biggest gain in the last ten years
was in service fields.

Total employment in Pittsburgh
decreased 26% since 1950, but that
is attributed to the decline in
population and the increased
length of schooling. White collar
employees edged over 50% of the
city’s labor force in 1970.

Almost 38% of city households
did not own_a car in 1970, while
15% owned two or more cars.
Fifty-six per cent of the employed
depended on a private car--as
driver or passenger--for transpor-
tation to work, 30% used public
transportation and nearly 15%
walked to‘ their job or‘ worked at
home. - For the rest of Allegheny
County, ownership of and depen-

'dence on cars was much higher.

Although 74% of employed
residents still worked in the city in
1970, the trend is toward increased
distance between job and resi-
dence. .

Twenty per cent of the heads of
households were under 35 and 25%
were 65 or older.

Seventy-four per cent of residen-
tial structures in the city were built
before 1939, while in the major
cities grouping, less than 50% of
housing units dated back that
early.

The median monthly gross rent
(including utilities) was $95 in
1970. Highest rent districts
included the Golden Triangle,
Shadyside, Squirrel Hill and
Ridgeimont-Chicken Hill.

The median value of owner-
occupied one-family homes--

 yBrather Is Watching You

computed from owner’s estimates--
was $12,500.

Pittsburgh beat national central
city figures of 8.5% with only 6.4%
of residential housing units here
averaging more than one person
per room. However, more than 7%

of these units lacked some or all ,

plumbing compared to 3.5% for
central cities as a group.

Pittsburgh is something different’

to everyone--‘ ‘ Someplace Special.”
And though a data sheet on
Pittsburgh is interesting and useful
for many purposes, it’s doubtful
anyone judges their city by the
numbers, datesland percentages.

Helen Reddy Move Over

 

  -/¥QIivio: AII-Americcln Sweetheart

BY KEN MINARIK

The meteoric world of pop music
has produced a new All-American
Sweetheart—regardless of the fact
that she is actually Australian.

Her name is Olivia Newton John,
and in the process of earning no
fewer than ﬁve gold records and
one platinum album in ten months,
she _has managed to capture the
hearts, minds" and wallets of the
American public. ‘ .
L To say that she is beautiful would
be a drastic understatement. Her

- . ,f“"5.g,lpiling, wide-eyed appearance

suggests that she just stepped from
the script of an adolescent sexual
fantasy. _

At 26, Olivia Newton-John has
been named Female Vocalist of the
Year by the Country Music As-
sociation, captured four American
Music Awards, and at this writing
is nominated for three Grammy
Awards.

Add to that her gold singles for‘

one million copies sold (“If You

Love Me Let Me Know,” “I

Honestly Love You”), a gold album
for one million dollars in sales (If
You Love Me Let Me Know], and

. ‘most recently a platinum album for

I  “oue million albums sold (IF You

Love Me...). -

On the record racks last year,
-Olivia was second only to Helen
Reddy in the number of total
records sold by a female vocalist.
Ironically, Reddy is also Austral-
ian. I

As if making money on records

3,f'ﬁI,wa‘sn’t enough, John’s live perfor-

mances have been drawing raves
from the critics and dollars from
the. public." She was anointed
1975’s Rising Star of the Year on
CBS’s Entertainer of the Year
Awards. . '

Last month, Olivia Newton-John
broke all-time attendence records
at the Dixie National Livestock
Show and Rodeo in Jackson, Miss-
__ issippi. Meanwhile‘, country music

1..-.-'pu_rists were protesting her success

and complaining about her foreign’
origin. ‘

Olivia Newton-John was born in
Cambridge, England, but at the
age of 5 moved to Melbourne,
Australia. Her Welsh-born father
was a professor and Master of
University College in Melbourne,
where Olivia spent her childhood.

Her grandfather was Nobel Prize-
winning physicist Max Born, who
she recalls as “Einstein’s best
friend.” .

She had started to sing “just for
something to do,” and at 14 she
was singing at a Melbourne coffee
lounge .owned by her brother-in-

law.

At 16, Olivia Newton-John made it
to London, where she toured with
Cliff Richard—Britian’s version of

 

  

 

Pat Boone. In early 1971 she
recorded her first single for Festi-
val Records International, “If Not

good as Dylan’s 1960’s master-
pieces. But it is'probably his best
album since John Wesley Harding
(1968).

Dylan’s contributions to contemp-
erary music are enormous.’ After
revitalizing topical folk music, he
led rock and roll into ‘newterritory
probing into personal relationships
bylbypassing the love cliches and
giving us a poetic vision in a string
of classics such as “Like a Rolling
Stone” and “Sad Eyed Lady of the
Lowlands”. - _

Yeah, you could see it at his
concerts last year, besides his own
original images Dylan put into
words what a lot of people felt.
John Wesley Harding (1968) was a
quiet digniﬁed record in an era of

psychedelic electric blur. In this)

album, Dylan pushed into new
territory with songs ‘infused with
mature insights. ,

But between John Wesley Hard-
ing and Nashville Skyline (1969)

Dylan apparently lost his self-’

conﬁdence. Nashville Skyline set-
tled for pleasantly _reiterating
instead of smashing
through them. i ‘

And though he’s written many

  -M.i...dD,l..  

ﬁnesongs since then, his work has
never been quite as good. Lik/e New
Morning (1970) and Planet Waves
(1974), Blood on the Tracks is an
eclectic mixture of styles and tones. -

Last year’s tour was the first sign
that Dylan was ready to move
again. Even though Planet Waves
is rather complacent, the old songs
he sang were the tough, challeng-
ing ones. “Most Likely You’ll Go
Your Way and I’ll Go Mine,” the
cry of freedom.

Dylan’s been around a long time
and he knows it.‘ His songs are
beginning to echo his earlier works
and “Tangled Up in Blue” on
the new album has_ a “one of the
survivors” attitude. .

Blood on the Tracks has much in
common with Dylan’s post-1968
records. The love songs, like the
earlier “If Not For You” and “On
A ‘Night Like This” are paeans_of ‘
gratitude. This time he sings of a .
woman who gave him “Shelter
From The Storm.”.

Dylan’s recent records take a
more even-handed view of personal
relationships. The put-downs of
“Positively 4th Street” have been
replaced by songs where Dylan
concedes his own faults and share
the blame. It’s a wistful sadness,

not bitterness that permeates
songs like “If You See Her Say
Hello”.

Unfortunately Dylan continues the
main weakness of his last few
albums. He offers cliches unself-
consciously. While John Wesley
Harding toyed with cliches, Dylan
now sings sincerely about a
“Simple Twist of Fate.”

But Blood ‘on the Tracks is
encouraging for Dylan admirers.
“Idiot Wind” shows that Dylan is
once again listening to what’s

blowing in the wind. It’s not really.r2""

political but it shows Dylan’s deep  '

awareness of other people.
And there’s the restlessness. I

guess last year’s tour is responsible -

for it but, at least in “Tangled Up
in Blue”, Dylan’s on the road
again. .

He has the conﬁdence to forsake
the familiar comforting support of
the Band for back-up musicians he
never recorded with before. Ten-
sion replaces the easy slackness 0
Planet Waves. s

Dylan still sings with the free
conﬁdent voice he introduced on
the tour. He sings naturally and
unashamedly; the mannered, de-
fensive sneers are gone. ‘

The music has heavy emphasis on
acoustic guitars and organ, similar
to previous Dylan records. And the
jacket,‘ despite Pete ‘Ha-mmill’s
verbose liner notes, is another
classic of simplicity,’

Blood on the Tracks isn’t’perfect.
But it’s far better than most new
records, and'Dylan"s maturity and
professionalism stand out against
today’s heavy metal noise.

This record is a good sign. Dylan’s
willing to try things again. The ﬁrst’
long story since “Frankie Lee and
Judas Priest” isn’t a total success,
but he’s trying. And succeeding

‘ 'more than he has_ for a while.  _
who else would have the imagina-

tion to compare “the pain‘ that
stops andistarts” to “a corkscrew

-{‘The track is a beautiful, ﬂat 220
Tartan surface with wide turns and
a good viewing area for the
spectators,” said Assistant Track
Coach Mike Agostinella: “‘It’s

_ _ deﬁnitely a runner’s track.” a
t§"Every year the Eastern Champ-
. ionship gets bigger and bigger but
the competition gets keener also.
This year is no exception.

“We had a choice to run our relay
teams or individual events,” said
Agostinella. “We decided to shoot
for the individuals to see what the
guys can do.” .,

With 99, teams entered in the
competition and God knows how
many individuals, it would seem to
present a problem as to who a team
winner would be but that ain't
necessarily so.

“Seton Hall (from New Jersey)

, and Villanova are the really strong
“'/A teams over all,” said Agostinella.
Sprinters are Seton Hall's forte.

They have so much talent they run

  
   

a mile relay with a low time using‘

their second string people. saving

their big guns for ‘the individual ‘

events.”
Seton Hall will run two men in the
440 yard dash against Karl Farmer
of’Pitt, now the third fastest man in
the US, one in the 600 against
Chuck Mozingo and a freshman 60
yard dash man who has run a 6.1.
“Villanova on the other hand is
strong in the half mile and the
1,000 yard run,” Agostinella
‘l”’s»’:.\-continued. They also have some
outstanding frosh such as a kid
' named Belger in the half mile.”
“Sparkle” Markley will be put to
the test he has wanted all season
v "long at Princeton when he runs
q -"against Ken Shappert of Villanova.

In other words it is.

iHe is supposedly one of the best in

the country but Markley will be out
to test his billing. ‘

Fourteen Pitt trackmen will be
making the -long ride to Princeton
later today.

“The trainers say Tim is ready.

_ He -has earned the trip -so he’s

going,” said Agostinella.

Willie Walker will again be
competing in the ‘_ 60 yard dash
while Jay Sharpley will go. in the
high hurdles. _

_Sharpley had‘ a false start at
Michigan State in the semiﬁnals
and was eliminated before getting
started.

Pitt will dust off its distance
medley relay for the Eastems with
freshmen Lee Carter, Mel Boyd
‘and Dave McDonald along with
sophomore Don Betterley trying to
better their time of 9:55. . .

“If the medley relay can take just

tenth or so off their time of some 

weeks back they should win the
race,” said Agostinella. “Villa-
nova wil1'be their major competi-

Track. Championships, Chuck
Mozingo, Rich Markley and Karl
Farmer will be running the 600,
1,000, and the 440 trying to add the
Easterns to their string of victories.

“It’s hard to say just how well Pitt'

can do,” said Agostinella. “All the
guys going have been picked by the
IC4A Committee so they are the
best we have. Every one of them
has the potential to take top honors

. and all have worked enough for it.”

lt’s tournament time for the Pitt
basketball team. After three
months of competition the Cats are
at the ﬁnal turn heading into the
stretch. Tonight and tomorrow the
Panthers_ will participate in the
ECAC Southern Division Tourna-
ment in the West Virginia Coli-
seum. Their opponents this even-
ing, in the 9 pm feature contest,
will be the West Virginia Moun-
taineers. .

Pitt is the top-seeded team in the
tournament with a 16-9 record
against the toughest competition
that anyone in the division has
faced. They have already faced the
Mountaineers on two occasions,
losing the first encounter in over-
time, 82-78, in the Coliseum and
coming out on top in the Pitt
Fieldhouse, 84-77. '

West Virginia’s record is a medi-

 Br YAIER LEHRER
If the Panthers plan torepresent
the ECAC Southern Conference in

the NCAA playoffs, they will have .

to make it over two hurdles. -The
ﬁrst is the Morgantowmjinx, but
assuming the Panthers do to the
Morgantown jinx what they didto
the -Palestra myth ‘earlier this
season, they will still have to play
the winner of what looks to be a
tooth and‘ nail "battle between
George Washington and George-
town. ' A ' 4 ‘
George Washington defeated
Georgetown in a close,82-78 match
'which saw the GW Colonials shoot
ablistering 82% from the ﬁeld in
the second half. The Georgetown

Hoyas will be out for revenge and

possibly the mythical Washington

9 championship’ which has eluded

them for the past six years. In that
time they have not been /able to
muster a victory over George
Washington. .

Both teams ooze with talent, but
George "Washington probably has
the edge. The Colonials’ number
one scorer, Pat Talent, averages
21.4 points per game.‘ The 6’3”
junior combines with Keith Morris
in the backcourt to give the
Colonials an average of 30.5 points
per game.

Another blue-chip player for GW
is Clyde Birwe1l,“a 6’11” senior
center.averaging 13.5 points and
11.5 rebounds per game. It was
Birwell’s work'on the boards that
gave George Washington it’s
victory over Georgetown, and if the
Hoyas. hope to be in the ﬁnals they
will have to box Birwell completely
out of the inside.

Height is.not lacking in George-_ ’

town’s lineuphowever. Trying to
contain the 6’11” Birwell will be a
frontline of Ed Hopkins, a 6’9”
freshman forward, Larry Long, a
6’7” sophomore forward, and
Merlin Wilson, a 6’9” sophomore
center. Between the three of them,
they average 29 points a ‘game,

--with the bench holding Bill Lynn,

another 6’9” forward averaging
10.4 points a game.

Whilethe key~to George Wash-
ington’s offense is the combined

‘ anticsyof Birwell and Tale'nt,.“the

ocre 13-12 and they have lost eight
out of their last eleven games. But
they have never lost to Pitt in the
Coliseum, even in the past two
yea'rs- when the Cats clearly had
them outclassed.

The adrenaline will be - flowing
tonight, however, and the Cats,
who blew a ten-point lead in their
ﬁrst meeting, should find WVU a
powerful adversary. On paper the
Cats have the edge. and a solid
performance will certainly send
them in the championship game
against the winner of the 7 pm
Georgetown-George Washington
contest. V 4 4

The Cats have been scoring an
average of 77 points a game while
limiting their opponents to just 70.
But they will need a better effort
than this to beat the Mountaineers,
who have managed to score over 80
points in a majority of their games. ~

The balanced Pitt attack should be
a big plus in tonight's competition.
West Virginia won’t be able to
concentrate on any single man
because the entire starting ﬁve is
capable of getting hot and burying
the Mountaineers. _ '

Senior guard _Kirk Bruce is the
leading scorer for Pitt with an
average of 18 points. -Tom Rich-
ards and Keith Starr ‘ are also
averaging in double ﬁrgures with
12 and 13 points per game, respec-
tively, and Lew Hill, who started
the season slow but has regained

average over nine points a game,_

with their sixth man, junior guard
Jonathan Smith, leading all
Georgetown scorers with an aver-

Possibly the biggest weaknesses
of Georgetown are youth and inex-
perience. The‘ starting lineup of

- the Hoyas boasts no seniors and
only one junior. Other than junior ,

college transfer guard Bill Thomas,
the Georgetown squad starts two
freshmen and two sophomores.

George Washington, on the other
hand starts one freshman forward,
Leslie Anderson, with the rest of
the starting lineup consisting of
two juniors, Talent and forward
Greg Miller, and two seniors in
Birwell and Morris.

Although George_ Washington has.

the toughest being Slippery Rock,
Clarion‘, East Stroudsburg and
West Chester, the top schools in
the state. Pitt was seeded for the

When Boyett was in high school,
his gymnastics expertise provided
some good times. Like when he
and some friends were in the school
library one’ day. They said they'd
give him a dollar if he did a back
ﬂip in the library, which was sure
to infuriate Ms. Librarian. Right
there, on the spot, he did the back
ﬂip. The kids roared and Mark
collected his dollar.

High_ school was in Arlington
Heights, Illinois, where Boyett also

captained his golf team. But golf»

\“Gymnastics was much different
from golf. I mean I never thought
about holes at our golf course like I
think about gymnastics. For
example, l’ll be sitting in class or
studying in my room, and I’ll.start
thinking about certain tricks in my
routine. Ithink it’s just the nature
of the sport that gets, me so
involved in it.”

‘Despite the satisfaction he re-
ceives from the sport, he often
thought abdut giving it up; but like
a 15 year old kid with acne who
can’t stop eating Hershey bars, he
never did. '

“After my senior year in high
school I almost quit -because I
didn’t think I could compete in
college,” says Boyett. “Butl came
to Pitt and stuck with it. And then I
almost didn’t go out for the team
this year. But after you’ve been

away from gymnastics for a while _

you really miss it, so I always come

. back.”

Last year at Easterns Boyett
scored an unspectacular 6.3 and 8.4
on the compulsory and optional
routine respectively because I got
the chokes,” but hopefully this
year will be better.

“If I hit on my compulsory
routine,” he explains, “I should
score a nine overall.” _

Boyett is the "only senior on a
squad comprised of an overwhelm-

the epitome of the quiet, unimpos-

certain discomforts for him.

“Being the only senior,” he
explains, “I felt like I was almost
separated from the. rest of the
team. I respect the ability of the
other guys on the team, but I
usually didn’t feel like an integral

up the scoring with only 1:28 gone’

Indiana played well in the first
