N ecking Night
Endorsed Here

Accor-ding to a recent ann-ounce-
ment, Lantern night will be re-
placed next fall hy a new event
to be known as Neckin-g Night.
Men students have felt slighted
because of not being able to take
part in Lantern Night. Necking
Night will give them a deﬁnite
part to play.

Shaugnessy beats his boys.

The -event will last three hours
and will consist of twelve ﬁfteen-
minute sessions, Each girl will be
given a printed list containing the
names of her twelve partners for
the evening. As is usual for cul-
tural events of this sort, the affair
will be held in the Commons room,
which will he c-urtained off into
two thousand individual compart-
ments for -the occasion. A warning
bell wi-ll ring two minutes before
‘the renid of each session.

Student co-chairman of the af-
fair will he Long M. Brace and
Will P. Pett. U. Adore Griddle,
dean of men, will supervise rules
and procedure.

When questioned further about
Necking Night, Griddle said, “We
feel it our duty‘ to enable students
to become hetter acquainted with
one another and th-is is one of the
best ways I know of accomplish-
ing this end.”

Bobson’s M ales C
Digging Up  

Sub-basement

Dix Bobson, president of Men’s
Council, has just "revealed a spec-
tacular plan of the Council to
make the Cathedral sub-basement
more homey. “The place lacks at-
mosphere,” Bobson said, “but we
think about $100,000 will ﬁx it
up.” At the same time he an-
nounced that plans for the dec-
orations have now been com-
pleted. Emphasis was placed on
the design for the gym, which will
be ﬁnished in knotty pine, with
exercise mats in an orientalmotif
and‘ hand-crocheted basketball
nets. ‘

Buell lives,on vitamin pills.

The Army Mess hall will be
done in Chinese Chippendale, with
walls an appropriate pea-soup
green and a minstrels-"' gallery
where a string quartet will play
during lunch hour. A dressing
room will be provided for those
men who ﬁnd it inconvenient to
change into ROTC uniforms at
home. It will be equipped with
button-polishing equipment and
convenient riﬂe racks.

That the presence of men at the
university may be felt more
strongly, the decorators have de-
parted from the predominating
proto-Gothic atmosphere of ”the
basement to include walls uphol-
stered in maroon leather and a
series‘of frescoes entitled “A His-
tory of Women at the University.”
However, those little balconies
overlooking the sub-sub-basement
will be brightened with potted
trees and deck chairs. And as a
concession to Mr. S. K. Minney
who has been complaining of late
that the boiler room of Heinz
Chapel is becoming crowded, a
new ofﬁce and practice room has
been planned for him in the sub-
sub-basement, with a decorative
motif of pipes and stokers.

In order to raise the money
necessary for the completion of
their project, .Men’s Council, has
decided to hold a series, of tytle

Won’cha Join
Gothic Gophers

In Galavanting

After the Gothic Gophers, the
committee to promote better con-
ditions in the Commons room, has
worked for two semesters to de-
vise satisfactory Commons room
life for the students, it should be
the duty of the student body to co-
operate. The Commons room, fel-
low Pittites, has been set aside as
a place of relaxation, yet, some
people insist on wearing dress
clothing to relax in rather than
the customary blue jeans. We are
also ﬁnding the lunching condi-
tions in the Commons room worse
and worse; people are constantly
loaﬁng at the tables, and others
cannot ﬁnd places to sit. Remem-

Last Friday, ﬁfth hour, we counted
eight people in the Blue Tuck
Shop, and those, because they
couldn’t ﬁnd eating space in the
Commons room. Cutting classes to
sip cokes in this room is becoming
too prevalent. Last of all, what
about our 4 o’clock jitterbug ses-
sions? The students aren’t coop-
erating in that either. Our Com-
mons Room jazz band sees no use
in reporting every eighth hour to
entertain a couple of stragglers.
We realize that many of you may
not show up because coke is being
served rather than tea. But, stu-
dents, there is a shortage of tea,
and untilthe war is over, please
be satisﬁed with coke and coop-
erate with the Gothic Gophers.

Screechers Fall
On Beam, Roger

Upatree Scratcharail, president
of Woman’s Screech association
has announced that although this
organization has been holding
round table discussions on the
square, the would-be soratyers
will now turn to the reading of
verse. /

Whiteman’s enrolled in the college, too.

When asked if the members
speak easy, Miss Scratcharail said,
“Natch.” Miss Shirk said “abs.”
Miss Yahn, who was wearing dark
glasses (but we knew her) came
on the scene with a pronounced
“def” on the situation. Miss Coax
was absent from the interview
but we’re sure her students were
hitting a new boom in voice cul-
ture.

Course Offered

Senile Seniors

Beginning March 31 from 8:30
o’clock to midnight, the Univer-
sity will offer a course in “‘senol-
ogy.” Dr. X. W. Hasbun, eminent
in the ﬁeld of “senology” and re-
lated sufbjects, will conduct the
course with the aid -of -ﬁve doctors
and three nurses’ aides.

Pegler says, “The Pitt News takes or-
ders from the Kremlin.”

The course is open only to those
over 75 and, by special permis-
sion of Dr. Hasbun, seniors will
he cordially welcomed. “Senology”
is something new at Pitt. It will
give -the septuagenarians an op-
portunity to brush up on their col-
lege work. Seniors will be able to
take four years of work in one
class period, thus relieving the
expected shortage of graduating
seniors. The -diplomas to be given

Riot Wrecks

worsella saved

A special announcement just re-
ceived from Miss Booth Jamlet,
manager, states that beginning to-
day the Blue Tuck Shop will be
closed two weeks for rep-airs ne-
cessitated by yesterday afternoon’s
riot. As a result of the melee
Rafael Razorscum is in jail and
Dick Barnyard, co-author of Pitts-
poori, is in the «hospital.

It all started when Rafael ap-
proached Barnyard and expressed
dissatisfaction with the way his
(Rafaiel’s name was mentioned in
last week’s column. Barnyard
tried using tact, -but Rafael, his

C0uI‘age ‘buoyed up by three dou-
ble cokes, Was not one to stop at
mere wor-ds. He told Barnyard
that if he had his say Pittspoori
would soon have its name chang-
ed to Sadsacki. Then, to drive
home his point, he picked up an
adjacent cash register and hurled
it at Barnyard’s head, narrowly
missing him. »

Seeking to prevent a seemingly
futile fracas, Bea Anemic, well
known campus lbleeder, stepped
between the two ibattlers and at-
tempted to calm them down. How-
ever, her efforts were to no avail
and soon, the various: supporters
-of Barnyard and Razorscum were
heaving furniture and «’bri»c-a-ibrac
all over the Tuck Shop. Finally,
police arrived to quell the disturb-
ance, ‘and were followed by an
ambulance for the injured.

Last. night, from his Ihopsital
bed, Barnyard issued the follow-
ing statement: “The whole inci-
dent was highly regrettable and
I’m afraid it will cause me to
miss the next meeting of Stoogs
Congress. I’m glad, though, that
my partner, Worseula, escaped
unscathed .and will be able to get
out the next column on sched-
ule.

From cell 66B, Razorscum said,
“I Iwuz robbed. I kin lick da burn
with my hands tied. Just wait til
next time.”

To the faculty and student body
from the members of the Pitt

P. S.—Happy April Fool’s Day Also.

 flay

Today is April Day—-like May
Day only a month earlier—on

’ Pitt’s campus. The celebr-ation will

begin this aft-ernoon at 2:30, at
whi-ch time there will be dancing
on the pavilion on the Cathedral
lawn on the Belleﬁeld side. This
pavilion will be up for to-day only
and is a contribution of the cred-
itors of the Pitt News. Music will
be -supplied by Arnie Steinman
and his Sweet -and Lowdown or-
chestra. Presiding -as master of
ceremonies will be Mr. Righteo-us
Cat Deichman. '

Among the acts in Mr. Deich-
man’s show will be an attempt by
Chesty Chuck Tremont to saw
Miss Betty Lou Hilligas in half
. . . Bill Humes and “Fifty Beau-
tiful Co-Eds Who Have Worn His
Pin” . . . Nancy Graper, a “key”
number, who will dive into. a three
inch tank of be-rling erl and come
out alive, bearing a man in her
teeth . . . Bob Bork and his new
woman, pinned with a ne-on Fiji
. Howard Lupovitz and his
practically living demonstration of
Sir Gawain and the Green
Knight . . . a duet by Shirley
Jennings and Johnny (‘Every Time
We Say Goodbye I Wanna Die)
Ridinger . . Eleanor Smith, the
girl who introduced steam heat
into Schenley Park . and as
a special ‘added attraction, in a
separate booth on the lawn, Dr’.
Jones’ English class, featuring the
girl in the back row who curls
her eyelashes in iambic pentame-
ter. ,

Off to one side, with an. audience
all her own, Pattie Watt will swing
from the spire of Heinz Chapel in

Ge/eécaiian

her death-defying trapeeze act.

For April Day only, the eleva-
tors are supplying extra-fast
vacuum transportation for any
students interested in using them.

Right in the center of the lawn,
on a raised dais equipped with
purple lights, Bob Buell will do
a strip tease to the accompaniment
of “Pomp and Circumstance” on a
bassoon.

Feature of the day will be a
trio—June Thomson, Betty Wolfe,
and Lee Mclnerny-——clad only in
costumes cunningly designed from
old copies of the News, singing
“Let’s Do It.” They will be accom-
panied by Tillie Sanker on the
bagpipes ,with Jim Pettican at the
HA'Mmond electric organ.

In competition with the celebra-
tion of this glorious April Day,
Chuck Berg and George Polimus
are co-hosting a little oﬂ?--campus
party at a local speakeasy. ‘

And to -end the day, the entire
News staff, who usually stay in
hiding all day Wednesday, will
descend from their hideout in the
hills high above the fabulous city
to sit sedately on the lavish turf,
murmuring softly to each other in
a strange tongue, while the ‘sun,
strangely reminiscent of a fried
egg, sinks slowly upon the pano-
rama, making a ﬁtting ending for
an April Day that will be long re-
membered as one of joyful festivi-
ties and glad-some merry—making.

The typical Pitt student is one
who spends his class time in the
Tuck Shop and his spare time in
class. The time spent in class is
usually used to do his nightwork
for the following class. Close co-
operation in test-taking is an es-
sential. For class discussion, it’s
taboo. '

In general, the girls are pre-
marriage majors, and the fellows
major in ﬁnding a different girl to
go out with every night. Both are
Tuck shop minors, however, in or-
der to further their special inter-
ests. Their motto is, “Never do
today what you can put off for
next time, and never do it at all
if you can put it off on someone
else.”

Each boy must have at least 12
girls to complete his minor suc-
cessfully. However, one man is
enough for the girls in pre-mar-
riage. Any Pitt student that
doesn't ﬁt the above description is
purely coincidental. Those that

.do, will probably get what they

came here for—marriage.

1 Things is Tough

By K. G. Trick

The University will adopt an
exhilarated program next semes-
ter, according to an announcement
from K. G. Trick, registrar. The
purpose of the program is to in-
crease enrollment by attracting
new students and, also, to keep
down wear and tear on professors.
Students are expected to feel very
exhilarated about it.

Sex is comln’ back. Where the Hell's
it been ‘til now.

Under the new set-up, classes
will begin at twenty minutes past
the hour and end thirty minutes
past. This will give students ﬁfty
minutes to get from one class to
another and is expected to cut
down tardiness. Professors will
give only three outside assign-
ments during a semester and all
exams will have the answers
printed on the back, in order to
help the more stupid element
among the student body, which,
the faculty feels, has been labor-
ing under a deﬁnite disadvantage.

In a warning tone of voice, Mr.
Trick points out that students will
be limited to 25 cuts in each class
per semester and that violators of
this rule will be dealt with se-
verely.

“Many people,” continues Mr.
Trick, “feel that college students
and graduates are too smart.” And
he adds, “We feel certain that our
new program will remedy this
condition.”

He spoke again, raising his hand |

“Fear not. A new prosition will

tinue the same policies that I have
initiated and maintained. Namely:
(1.) Selling only Rameses in the
Tuck Shops. (2.) Snatching athletic
passes from all unsuspecting
fresh-men. (3.) Holding teas, but

charging for the use of the cups. .

(4.) Prohiibitin-g talking and other
forms of vulgar-ity on the prem-
ises. And (5.) Not letting anyone
muscle in on our territory.”

A sigh of relief echoed through-
out the room. -

With -that the group bowed low
and backed into the outer office.

Pennsylvania? Good. We just need somebody from Pennsylvania.
Come over here where we can be private. Conﬁdential stuff, see?”

I followed him to the corner. The brother looked about to in-
sure privacy, then spoke quietly into my ear:

“It’s this way, brother. We don’t want another war, do we?
That’s settled. We don’t want the North and South to ﬁght anymore.
Okay, it’s this way: Whiteman’s from Missouri, Briney’s from Ken-
tuckey, Ice’s from Ohio, I’m from Minnesota———and you’re from Penn-

sylvania.

All right; Whiteman’s gonna see the governor of Missouri,
Briney, the governor of Kentucky, Ice’ll talk to the governor of Ohio,
and I’ll buzz the governor of Minnesota—-a great pal of mine.

“Thanks, brother-——we gotta get

“Gonna vote -—— or are you old

“Say—I voted for Cleveland.”

“A few of us boys got together
and put Washington in.”

“I organized the Indians and
put ‘Columbus over.”

“I carried Rome for Cincinnati

“No--listen.”

I listened in on the sad story

Who

I of Cato. -

-Cato was an old Roman in the
days when the Carthage gang was
the big rival of the boys from the
Tiber. The. Neros knocked off the
Africanos so often that they drop-
ped them from the schedule and
"went out -looking for somebody
who could ﬁll-the Amphitheatre.

However, Cato kept scouting
them and discovered that the Car-

thaginians had gone out and got
. themselves a team, including a

bruising fullback} named Hannibal
and a ﬂock of linemen strong as
elephants. Cato tip-ped off the
athletic board at Rome but they
gave him the berries. But Cato
was persistent and whenever he

Basic English

Room Planned

.. In a recent announcement Dr.
 Don Gadget Hootmon has disclos-
ed that plans are under considera-
tion for -an addition to the Univer-
sity’s nationality rooms. “The pro-
posed Basic English room will be
built and furnished in- tone with
the language it is to represent,”
Dr. Hootmon said. According to
present tentative plans the new
room will have six walls—four on
the sides, one above and one be-
low, (there is neither “ceiling”
nor “ﬂoor” in the Basic English
vocabulary) one table, chairs, and
lights. On the rear wall there will
be a large picture of C. K. Ogden,
chief exponent of the language,
and for the table a bust of I.A.R.
Richards with a ﬂat head for lec-
ture notes has already been started
by Hugh Chisler, the French
sculptor. .

Life is just a. bowl of vegetable soup.

Lectures conducted in this class-
room will be given in Basic Eng-
lish and only those students in
the upper two-ﬁfths of their kin-
dergarten graduating class will be
permitted to register for courses
there, according to a new ruling
made public by Mr. Pepper Mints,
assistant registrar.

“Due to wartime and pecuniary
restrictions -however,” Dr. Hoot-
mon said “there will be a slight
delay in the room’s completion.”

Artist To Lecture

Here On “Form”

Dr. Snalter Feed Shovey, head
of the ﬁner arts department, has
just announced a lecture to be
given Tuesday, March 32, at 10
o’clock in ‘room 3'24 Cathedral by
Miss Anne Corio, EST (Exponent
of Strip Tease.) The subject of
Miss Corio’s lecture will be “The
Striptease, a Modern Artform.”

Finally PlKAs all meet each other.

“I want to urge students to at-

afterthought, “I have just com-
pleted a two-hour conference with
Miss Corio, and believe me, it is
an art and it certainly does have
form.”

Her big brown eyes reddened by

students that previous to her en-
gagement she spent mo-st of her
free hours beating the books in
the ﬁfth-ﬂoor reference library.
“I miss the noise so,” she whis-
pered in a husky voice. “The Tuck
Shop is too quiet for me.”

Miss Coed further charged that
Mr. College forcibly seized her
by the hair and dragged her,
screaming with pain, to his fra-

the blue TS and she had refused
to accompany him there of her
own free-wheeling will. She point-
ed to several bal-d spots on her

The Yaldred Conference, or It
Can Happen Here. An original
one-act play by Hank Daley.

(Scene: Left hand corner of the
Yaldred Room. Time: the future.
Rich Darnhard, leader of all stu-
dent activities, sits on an enor-
mous throne. At his feet are Tarry
Slurwinkel and Tuck Shop Tony,
henchmen and court jesters.)

Dick Darnhard.‘ “Well, Tony,
what dirt do you h-ave besides
what’s under your ﬁngernails?”

Tony: “Fine T.T. Tarry, make
a note to tell the boys at the next
IF meeting to arrange their dances
accordingly. Four dances to be
held on the four days preceding
the Spring Festival and two to be

held on the same night. That
ought to show them.”

Bowman bets on bangtails.

Tarry Slurwinkel: (Who has

been quiet thus far because he
has been busy cleaning his knife
with Tony’s ﬁngernails.) “Hey, I
heard some freshie say he wasn’t
going to join a fraternity.”

Darnhard.: “See? what did I tell
you? *We’ne being persecuted.
Everybody’s against us. _

((At this point Tim Sudswig
.=tipt0es into the room. He is fam-
ous, for his loud shirts and mouth
to match.)

Sudswig: “Heil! Say this is a
swell headquarters, this is. No
one ever comes here. Too many
books.”

Darnhard: “Ah, shut yer mouth.”

Tony (In hysterics): “Chee, the
boss is sure sharp today.”

Sudswig: “I just heard one of the
barbarians in the Tuck S-hop say
someone ought to organize an in-
dependent party.”

 NYU Cops  Title; ‘
Beats USU in Overtime

By Larry Bondy
With Dr. Carlson taking in the sights of New York and Miss
Woomer, the student health nurse on the 34th ﬂoor, refusing to re-
. lease any news on the court front, our attention is focused on the
‘games at Madisonsquare Gardens.

The Violets were chosen to rep-9

I resent Section 2 after a whirlwind
ﬁnish. Keeping up this fast clip
whichisent the-m back to the Gar-
dens, the Violets squeezed out
their ﬁrst tournament win over a
weakbut determined Tuft’s team.
This‘ victory gave Howie Cann’s
men an opportunity to compete
in the ﬁnals.

Ohio State came through with
the ﬁrst upset of the tourney
handing Kentucky their third loss

3 of the season. The Blue-Grass

 , boys defeated the Buckeyes on
their home court earlier this year
but didn’t fare so well in neutral
territory.

The Buckeyes took an early lead
over New York University by the
virtue of Dugger’s' free throw.
NYU retaliated with Sid Tannen-
baurn, the main-stay of the New
Yorkers, sinking a two pointer
from far out. From here on in, it
was a nip and tuck game. The

9 ﬁrst half ended with the Buckeyes
leading 3-6 to 34. The second half

‘proved to be the most thrilling
to the 18,000 odd fans who jam-
med the Hall that Tex built. The
Staters led by two points with
seconds remaining. Failing to use
the strategy of taking the ball out
of bounds on a personal foul,
they shot and missed. The Violets
took the ball off the banking board
and made two points a split second
before the gun shot; ‘The ﬁve min-
ute overtime gavethe rejuvenat-
ed -Cann men enough time to cclme

. out on top -of a 72-65 score.

Third place honors went to
Kentucky as they socked Tufts
with its second loss, 66-56.

Letter To Editor

March 23, 1945
Dear Editor:

Last week’s editorial entitled “A
x Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” seems‘
to us unfair. The issue it deﬁnes
and deals with has not been an
issue in any of the planning for
the ﬂoor. At all times Commission
and all groups interested have
taken for granted that the ﬂoor
should be and will be informal.

In. the Commission meeting on
February 8 the question of where
smoking would be permitted on
the Twelfth Floor was raised.
Some students thought it should
be conﬁned to the roof-deck
When the matter was opened for
free discussion, however, it was
obvious that Commission thought
this would not meet the needs of
the student body. It was suggested
that smoking be permitted in at
least several other rooms. These
ideas were accepted as logical and
desirable. They were accepted as
a basis for further planning.

Another question raised at this
eventful Commission meeting con-
cerned the type of recordings to
be included in the record collec-
tion in the Pine Social Room. We
wanted the very best in records,
popular as well as classical. We
agreed that we not only wanted
but needed popular records to
help create the informal atmo-
sphere the student would like in
this social room.

We are in no way attempting
to substitute the Twelfth Floor
for the Tuck Shop, but rather we
wish the Twelfth Floor to add
something to student life at the
University. We want it to rep-
resent the life of ‘women at its
best. Th-is does not mean stiffness
and formality. It means rather
friendliness, relaxation, dancing,
ping pong-—all the things women
students like to do. The only re-
straint placed upon us will be that
which any cultivated person
places upon herself——the restraint
of good taste and. consideration of
others. Upon the suggestions and
cooperation of the women de-
pends the success of the ﬂoor.
Above all we want it to be a ﬂoor
planned by students for students.

As members of W. S. G. A.
Commission we feel it our obliga-
tion to correct misleading impres-
sions. We ﬁnd the above state-
ment an accurate account of the
proceedings at the 2 Commission
meeting in question.

Cage Championship Undecided As Sason
C 'I-F Council To Rule on PiKA-
 Five-way Tie Likely

By Lowell Lubic

After seven weeks of hard
fought competition, it appears as
if the ﬁnal outcome of the IF
basketball league lies in the hands
of inter—fraternity council. Events
of the past week have boiled down
to the outcome of the already
played basketball game between
the SAEs and the PiKAs. Winning
this ﬁnal game would give the
SAES a ﬁnal standing of 7 wins
and 1 loss. This would. insure
them ﬁrst place since the best
record any other team could have
would be 6 wins against 2 losses.
However, should, the PiKAs
emerge the‘ victor from that con-
tr-oversial contest, the IF league
would be thrown into at ﬁve-way
tie for ﬁrst place between the
SAEs, PiKAs, Phi Eps, Pi Lams,
and the Phi Gams. The SAEs have
stated that in their game with the
PiKAs they should be declared
the victor since the game ended
before Tomadolsky was awarded
the foul which ti-ed up the game
.at that time the score was 30 to
29 in favor of the SAES. On the
other hand " the PiKAs have said
that the game ended after Toma‘-
dolsky was given the foul and
therefore he is permitted to shoot
it. The controversy upon summa-
tion becomes this: was Tomadol-
sky awarded the foul before the
game -ended‘? If he was, the game
ended in a 30 to 30 tie and there-
fore should be played -over. If the
opposite is true, the SAEs win the
game and become IF basketball
champs. The timers disagree in
their stories favoring either the

PiKA version or the SAE version.
Les Sarules, athletic chairman,
had previously ruled that a ﬁve
minute overtime should be played
to decide the victor. However, it
now appears that the SAEs are go-
ing to carry the matter to IF coun-
cil. Anxiety as to the outcome of
the controversy will remain until
the next Tuesday -meeting of IF
c-ouncil. ,

Maintaining their red hot pace
the Pi Lams trounced the Phi
Eps 37 to 18. This defeat ended
a ﬁve-game winning streak for
the Phi Eps and practically crush-
ed their hopes for the IF basket-
ball championship. The game was
more closely contested than the
score seems. Early in the ﬁrst
quarter the Pi Lams took a com-
manding 7-to—1 lead. However,
the Phi Eps surged back with two
quick ﬁeld goals by Pincus and
Silverblatt. But try as they might
it was not the Phi Eps’ day to
shine. From there on the Pi Lams
began to clock and show why they
are rated as the outstanding team
of the league. Point after point
slipped through the net as the Pi
Lams were not to be stopped.
Even -the brilliant defensive tac-
tics of the Phi Eps were to no
avail as the Pi Lams continued to
utilize their overwhelming height.

Speaks on Plastics

Dr. James C-oull will .represent
the University at Deshon hospital
where he will speak on the topic
o-f “The New Plast-ics” on Wednes-
day, April 4.

Dr. Coull did extensive research
work for Tidewater Oil corpora-
tion and was a memb-e rof the
faculty a-t Cooper university in
New York before coming to Pitt
in 1939.

The half ended 20 to 8 and the
third quarter clinched the game‘
as the Pi Lams: led 28 to 12. I-Iig
scorer for the victors was Beck-
with sixteen points who scored al-
most at will in the third quarte ‘

No one seems to‘ know how thé
Phi Eps beat the SAEs 35 to 30;
Everything pointed to an easy.
SAE victory. Only the day before‘,
this same Phi Ep team had be.
unmercifully beaten by th.e‘r
closest rivals. On top of this, thr
Phi Ep starters received injuries
from the previous -game and two
of these boys Blumenfeld and Gold
were unable to play against the
SAE-s.‘ Even the fact that Payton,
SAE star, did not play did not
change the pre—game feeling. The
Phi_Eps won thus preventing the
SAEs from winning the basketba,
championship. But more so, the
Phi A Eps gained back their lost
spirit as Richard Seewald, forinei‘. I
Taylor Allderdice star, ﬁnally
came dip to expectations. He 
trolled the bank boards, scored 1 ’_‘
points, and held the riddled Phi
Ep team together. In the
quarter, after trailing 12 to
the Phi Eps scored 12 straight
points to take the lead. The game
progressed with the lead see-saw”-'
ing until the fourth quarter when
the score was knotted at 22 to 225
From there on Seewald paced the
Phi Eps with six points and co“
trolled the bankboards until the
ﬁnal whistle had sounded. His
ﬁnal basket with 30 seconds re-
maining was the blow that crushéj
ed the SAEs. ,

A highly-keyed SAE team de-
feated the Phi Gams 24 to 20. It
must have been the Phi Ep up-.
set that woke the SAEs up to the
fact that they were not in-vincible.
With this in mind the ’SAEs fought
hard throughout the entire game
The Phi Gams led by two or th-_’r
points for about 30 minutes. In the
last minutes of the game the SAES
struck quickly to gain a four-poi
lead which they held until the ends
Starring for the victors were Lof-
zar and Kosh. This defeat prevent-
ed the Phi 'Gams from winning the
league championship. V 7 ’

In the ﬁnal game of the week
the Pi Lams defeated the Delts 40

In planning the program for the
conference, the committee, headed
by Mel Roberts, C, of the,YMCA,
has taken care to include such
events as hiking, canoeing, and a
campﬁre on Saturday. night." As
has been true in the past, there
will also be several’ outstanding
speakers who will lead discussions
of great interest to the average
student. Already, Dr. James Orr,
of the VBellefield Presbyterian
church, and Professor ‘Demas
Barnes of the history department
have consented to discuss the
various aspects of Christian lead-
ership, which is the general theme
of the conference. Other members
of the faculty vwill include Mrs.
Edna Batz, Miss D. J. Kell, and
Mr. J. Fred Miller, of the YWCA
and YMCA. .

All students who are interested
in going to the conference should
visit the YMCA or YWCA in the
near future. There they may ob-
tain more information concerning
the conference, expenses, and pro-
gram.

“I have visited many of the
world’s famous universities and

institutions of learning but none,

has provided the atmosphere to
me that I found, in the 42—story
Gothic structure whose Commons
room and nationality classrooms
brought back to me the struggle
in which ‘man has engaged as he
has pushed through darkness to
ﬁnd that knowledge and develop
that wisdom by which‘ people
could ﬁnd: a richer life,” said Mr.
Gaeth on his ﬁrst nationwide
broadcast.

“Yesterday afternoon I met the 7

Chancellor of the University of
Pittsburgh . . . the man who
dreamed the great Cathedral- of
Learning, the Heinz chapel, and

the Stephen Foster memorial—and:

then set about to raise some ten
million dollars to see those dreams
-come true,” said Mr. Gaeth on
his second broadcast. These build-
ings, he said, “represent the best
in classical architecture in the last
400 years.” ,

“What impressed me most,” he
said, “was not t at these people

-had built a monument in stone but‘

that they did it in the interest
of . . . future generations. They
did it for the effect it would have
upon the th-ous-ands o.f students
who will
classrooms, the chapel and. the
theater. ‘They set forth a state-
ment of purposes .
now I have been depicting the
brutal realities of a world at war

. . ,To lift ourselves out of that
reality, we need ideals '. . Much
of that we mustbuild in educa-
tion—out of the inspiration of the
best that past ages have contrib-
uted . . . Now these people here
in Pitts-burgh want to place their
youth in the best possible environ-
ment for learning.”
