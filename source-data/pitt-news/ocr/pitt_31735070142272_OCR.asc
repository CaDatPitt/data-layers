Don we now our ugly apparel

College students fmd festive party theme in old, ugly sweaters

Leena Ketkar
For The Pitt News

Once only a cozy symbol of holi-
day togetherness, ugly holiday
sweaters have achieved new life
as a college party theme.

“Ugly sweater parties are a
holiday standard, and I thought
that the perfect way for my friends
and I to blow off steam before ﬁ-

nals would be to geta Santa keg,
don a sweater and rock on,” Pitt
student Liz Van Loon said.

Van Loon, who hosted a fugly

V sweater party last Saturday and

has attended them in the past,
said she already had her sweater,
but most party attendees went to
the South Side’s Goodwill store,
and one even borrowed a sweater
from their grandmother.

Pitt juniors Collin Waggen-

spack and Stephanie Cole at-
tended Van Loon’s party.

Waggenspack’s $3 muted
sweater, embroidered with light
blue and pink ﬂowers, “had an old
grandma smell,” he said.

He said there were so many
good options when he went shop-
ping at Goodwill that it was hard
to pick just one.

Cole said that while shopping
at The Salvation Army in the fall,

she spotted a silky red—and—green
shirt that she knew would be per-
fect for a future holiday party.
“I’m pretty sure it cost maybe
$3  I wouldn’t spend more than
$5 or $6 unless it was fabulously
ugly,” she said. H
Van Loon had a similar re-
action to having to pay more
than a couple dollars for an ugly
sweater.

Ugly festive sweaters were once a fashion faux pas, butnow they’re a reason to party.

It’s 20 minutes before kickoff. In
the locker room, Pitt football play-
ers are psyching themselves up for
the game.

But on the ﬁeld, the Pitt var-
sity marching band is performing
its pregame show to pump up the
crowd — andjack R. Anderson is
dancing.

- “Jack loves when the band plays
‘Dude Short,’ which is the ending
to one of our songs,” piccolo squad
leader Emily Mallit said. “It’s really
peppy, just quick little sound bites.
Whenever we play it, he starts
jumping up and down.”

Whether‘ dancing or conduct-
ing, Anderson knows how to keep
Pitt’s band running smoothly in
his 15th year as director of the
program. i A

“The chords are so big and the
drum parts are written so well that
it gets your blood boiling a little bit
and just makes me dance,” Ander-
son said of the piece.

Anderson knows how to pump
up fans at games with “Hail to Pitt”,
but he can also motivate his band
members at practice.

“He’s been able to take the very
complex and military—like setting
of a college marching band and
make it very enjoyable for every-
one involved,” senior drum major
Tyler McGaughey said.

tice fun. With practice four days a

Council postpones Fair Share Tax vote again

Lindsay Carroll and Liz Navratil

News Editors

lDivided Pitisburgh City Council mem-

bers decided once again to postpone
voting on the Fair Share Tax by one
week yesterday.

The council members spent about
half an hour debating the merit of
postponing the vote to give city oﬁi-

universities.

too much, but if I found the perfect ‘Happy
Kwanzaa’ or ‘Festivus’ sweater, I would be
willing to pay anything,” she said.

At least in the winter months when tem-

peratures reach below freezing, these ugly '

holiday sweaters provide warmth while

traipsing through Oakland, and some

trendsters can even pull off these pullovers
without a red Solo cup in hand.

Pitt student Tayler Bolea enjoys sporting
a festive holiday-sweater out on a Friday
night every now andthen.

“I love these sweater parties. It gives
me an excuse to wear something warm in
December to a party,” she said. “Some other
girls may not choose comfort over skimpy,
revealing clothes  I may have gotten my
sweater from Goodwill, but at least I know
I’ll be wearing it home.”

Not all students have been drawn into
the ugly holiday madness.

Mary McDaniel doesn’t understand the
purpose of a bunch of people getting to-
gether and wearing ugly, itchy sweaters
on a Friday or Saturday night.

“My idea of fun isn’t putting on a huge
acrylic sweater and getting drunk,” she
said.

Brett Schupack, however, thinks it’s

funny and enjoys watching students stum- .

ble through South Oakland in hideous
sweaters dating back to 1965.

These holiday sweaters have created a
whole new market and an online_ frenzy.
One of the many websites dedicated to ugly
sweater parties, www.UglySweaterStore.
com, was started just a year ago by two
friends-in Chicago. These sites have taken
ugly sweater parties to a new level, provid-
ing party tips and even selling a plethora
of festive sweaters online.

said in an e-mail, “We hunt through thrift
stores, department store racks, friends/
families closets and anywhere else ugly
sweaters might be to ﬁnd the ugliest attire
out there for our customers!”

Even the University bought into the
trend. Market Central held an Ugly Sweater
Holiday Buffet from 4 to 8 p.m. yester-
day.

“The sweaters will be ugly but the food
will be delicious!” the sign in Towers lobby
proclaimed.

While Market Central was appropriately
decked out with holiday gear and employ-
ees donned Santa hats, students seemed
to lack the same enthusiasm.

The holiday spread drew the hungry
in, but the theme might have been lost on
students preoccupied with ﬁnals stress.

Pitt freshman Shelby Cooper said that
while the idea of having an Ugly Sweater
Holiday Buffet is funny, she would never ac-
tually partake and wear an ugly sweater.

Finals Fortnight
a possible fixto
students’ woes

or undergraduate students,
it’s not technically Finals

Week, but it feels like it. C

Some classes have already ended,
even though ﬁnal exams suppos-
edly don’t start until next week.

The term “Finals Week” is a
misnomer, because ﬁnal exams are
a de facto two-week endeavor for
many students. Some professors
simply call their ﬁnals a “test” and
administer it early. Pitt should of-
ﬁcially recognize this and institute
“Finals Fortnight.”

This would allot two weeks to
ﬁnal examinations, thereby giving
students an extra week without
classes to study and take ﬁnals.
Before you go saying, “Hey, Pitt
News, your idea is fanciful malar-
key,” consider that this concept
has precedent. Pitt’s School of Law
already administers ﬁnals Dec. 7-18
— a whole two-week period.

This bears the consequence of
classes starting on Aug. 24, in-
stead of Aug. 30, but the beneﬁts
outweigh such detriments.

During this last week of classes,
stress levels skyrocket. Students
stay up all night studying, con-
suming coffee‘ by the trough and
then, as a consequence, acciden-
tally sleep through the next day’s
review lecture. Cramming like this
gave rise to the FINALS acronym:
“F*ck, I Never Actually Learned
this Sh*t.”

Admittedly, some of the stress
that comes with ﬁnals is because
of poor planning on the students’
parts. If Pitt were to institute Finals
Fortnight, what’s to stop lethargic
students from merely procrasti-
nating another week?

Nothing really. But the Uni-
versity can’t plan around those
who aren’t trying. Pitt should
plan around the elbow-greasing
students who study and work but
don’t have enough time for their
toils.

Sleep deprivation lowers the

ability to concentrate, thus skew-
ing test results, and it weakens
the immune system. Illnesses like

, respiratory infection and mono-

nucleosis spike toward the end of
each semester, according to Kent-
NewsNet of Kent State University.
There’s also that porcine ﬂu bug
lurking in unwashed study areas.

The lengthy stress can initiate
depression, stomach ulcers and
acne outbreaks, as well as encour-
age substance abuse. A

Smokers become one-man
smog factories, inviting Al Gore
to intervene on their carbon out-
put. Worse yet,‘The Orion reported
that many, California State Univer-
sity students rely on Adderall, a
prescription amphetamine, to get
through ﬁnals. ~ I

The hectic schedule of ﬁnals
doesn’t excuse these behaviors
— they’re just a reality. If Pitt can
intervene and alleviate that, even
with a modest change, it could help
a lot of students who are freak-
ing out.

There is a certain camaraderie
and sense of accomplishment that
comes with collectively surviving
this trauma. Even some bragga-
docio enters when students com-
pare their schedules and shop in
the one-upmanship aisle: .“Oh you
have three exams tomorrow? How

_ pedestrian. I have seven, plus a40-

page paper and a presentation in
Sanskrit!”

While this seems like Hell Week,
it’s far from the ninth circle. Yet
Finals Fortnight could remove this
entire process from the infernal
spectrum.

The University of Alabama an-

nounced yesterday it will cancel

Jan. 6-8 classes so students can
watch their football team in the
BCS National Championship.
Surely Pitt could cancel some extra
classes to let students concentrate
on studying.

Columnist

Usually, we need a catchy name
or title to attract our attention
to a larger body of information.

It’s hard for me to pick up “The _'

Economist” and start reading.
It’s a lot easier to pull up a blog
where the information is short
and snappy. .
Blame it on technology like in-
stant messaging or rapid-paced

television, but we like short at- l

tractive bits of information. Long
drawn—out descriptions and dis-
courses are just too much to digest
and provide entertainment at the
same time.

Some college courses are
naturally bound to ﬁll up. At Pitt,
Foundations of Biology has noth-
ing to worry about in attracting
students. There is a high demand
for it.

However, some courses that
usually have few students, maybe
because of economic trends, sur-
vive on the demand they receive.

To survive, you must increase
demand.

But how?

Professors at colleges across
the United States have an idea.
Speciﬁcally, change the titles and

, content of courses. An interesting

title does half the work.
Recently, traditional courses

Jessica Holmes, assistant pro-
fessor of economics at Middle-

. bury College, had the solution. She ,
called it The Economics of “Sin”:

Sex, Crime, and Drugs.

The course is the same Intro to
Microeconomics concepts, but the
theories are related to activities a

and enrollment tripled. Who cares
for literature when you can learn
about the chivalry and heroism of
the actual characters?

Such rebranded and re-en-
gineered courses sound a world
more entertaining than their
traditional counterparts. Market
economy culture is deeply rooted
in U.S. society, so it’s not a surprise

. its tentacles would reach college

campuses. People see about 3,000
advertisements per day, so why
not add a few more?

Renaming trends in college
courses are just the beginning.
College rebranding itself looms
in the near future. Many colleges
have to worry about future enroll-
ment for a few key reasons.

The baby boom echo is fading,
college tuition is increasing, the
economy is lagging and unem-
ployment is high.

It becomes harder to afford
education with a price tag in the
tens of thousands. Colleges will
rebrand themselves, either to sur-
vive as institutions or to prosper

above others.

All colleges cannot be com-
pared side by side, as they have
different focuses and will attract

different students. Still, some in-_

stitutions don’t rely on student
tuition as much as others — some
are public and others private. But
within their tiers, competition is
sure to ensue.
Neighboring schools ﬁghting
- for enrollment will pursue mak-
ing their deal more appealing to
students. This could mean adjust-
ing attending costs, giving more
aid or improving the curriculum.
But that all requires money, and
decreased state ﬁmding for higher
education delivers little aid:
Competition is fundamental to
our capitalist society. '
Competitors try to improve
themselves, what they have to of-
fer and their product essentially
to win the race. - ‘
Without the starting materials,
_ public schools cannot compete to
their potential. _
They are left to muster whait

  Rebrand to up enrollment

the wallet will allow. Unfortu-
nately, higher education in the
United States might see a decrease
in quality.

What has a nation but not its
youth to advance it‘? Intangible
wealth, education and our future

is just as important as the tan-‘
. gible.

The United States ranks 57th
in the world for percent of GDP
spent on education.VWe need to
start seeingimprovement if we
want to survive in the global mar-
ket. Thankfully, our Pennsylvania
fared wellwith an overall state
school budget increase of 5 per-
cent.‘ ' I

There are still other states to
consider, though, and the country
should move forward as a whole.

For now, Iwill continue to scout
around for that “Harry Potter”
Literature class. I will be reminded
my school is always competitive
and always stays keen to improve
itself. Panthers Pride.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I am writing in regards to the article “Board denies funds for
anti-abortion group.”

I was present at the Student Government Board meeting on Tues-
day night, and let me assure your readers that SGB President-elect

Charlie Shull’s rationale is indeed as flawed as it appears in the

article. .
If Shull has a problem with the religious members of this campus,

g that’s ﬁne. It’s his opinion.

In any case, his reasoning that the March for Life is a “proselytiz-
ing” event flies in the face of the fact that it isn’t a religiousevent by
any means, as mentioned by both Students for Life member Justin
Romeo and Peter Gruber, the president of the group. ‘Having been
to the March for Life in previous years, I can say with certainty
that it is not an effort to convert people to a religion but to voice
an opinion. ’ '

If voicing an opinion is proselytizing, then all political‘ groups at
Pitt ought to have-their funding revoked. Shull did take the time to
mention Romeo’s religious convictions, which weren’t relevant to
the topic of funding at all. I think this is evidently a case of Board
members’ bias. ’

Hillel to host competitive Iatke cook—off

Sierra Starks
Staﬂ‘ Writer

6:30 p.m.

Hilleljewish University Center of
Pittsburgh

hilleljuc.org

Ready. Set. Latke!

As anticipation grows for this
year’s Hanukkahparty hosted by
The Edward and Rose Berman Hil-

lel Jewish University Center (Hillel -

JUC), potato pancakes seem to be at
the forefront of everyone’s mind.

This year’s festivities include a
candle lighting ceremony in cel-
ebration of the holiday, live music
from the David Landes Jazz Band
and Jewish a cappella group, the
Vokols, tons of traditional food,
dreidel spinning and more.

But this year, Hillel’s traditional
holiday party will add a competitive
edge to the holiday merry-making
—— Iron Chef style.

Hillel’s holiday contest is a
spinoff of the Food Network’s
“Iron Chef America,” a show that
pits world-renowned chefs against
one another in an epic battle to be
crowned the best in the business.

Hillel’s version, titled “Iron Chef
Latkes,” pits Pitt student against
Pitt student in an epic battle to be
crowned King or Queen of the Lat-
kes.

Before the oil has even hit the
pan, the competition is heating

‘1P- .
“It will be unreal,” Marc Schutz-
bank, the public relations intern for
HillelJUC, said of the event. He is al-
ready declaring himself the Winner
of the latke—making competition.

He and seven other contestants
split into four teams of two, will
have 45 minutes to prepare their
best latkes and mustincorporate
the “secret ingredient,” which will
be revealed during the competi-
tion. "

“Everyone should come out for
my latkes because they’re going to
be delicious,” he said.

When asked how concerned he
was about his competition, Schutz-
bank conﬁdently answered, “With

‘ my cooking talent, obviouslyl don’t

need to worry.”
— Schutzbank is more than ready
for the challenge. _ i

“Basically, it’s just allowing me to
get into my creative spirit and put
my ﬁve years of college dorm room
cooking to use,” he said.

Current Hillel JUC Jewish Life
Chair Becca Tanen, whom Schutz-
bank declared the brains behind
the Iron Chef Latkes operation,
encouraged students of all faiths
and ethnicities to come celebrate
Hanuldcah with HillelJUC. She ad-
mitted that Iron Chef Latkes was
something she’s been excited about
for a long time.

“[Iron Chef Latkes] is a way for
students to get excited about a tra-
ditional part of Hanukkah, the latke

making, while adding a modern
twist so that they could have ﬁm

“The party itself is a great op-
portunity,” Schutzbank said. “I

' used to celebrate Hanukkah with

my parents every year, and now Hil-
lel is like a family that people can
celebrate Hanukkah with and have

a great time.”. .

Hanukkah is a festival of light
honoring the rededication of the
Holy Temple more than 21 centu-
ries ago byJudah Maccabee and his
brothers. The miracle of Hanuk-
kah stems from the account that the
brothers had enough oil to light the
menorah for eight days.

Making latkes — grated potato

with various ingredients fried in oil V

to a golden ﬂapjack —— is aJewish
tradition associated with the holi-
day. Alongwith latkes, sufganiyots
(doughnuts) are also eaten.

“Basically, you eat lots of fried
things because the oil lasted for a
long time,” Schutzbank said.

Sports, politics, drama: ‘Invictus’ does it all

Clint Eastwood’s latest flick tells the story of Nelson Mandela’s struggle to desegregate South Africa

“Invictus” J

Starring: Morgan Freeman, Matt
Damon

Director: Clint Eastwood

Studio: Spyglass Entertainment
Grade: A- '

It’s uncommon to combine a

biopic, political drama and sports
ﬂick into one movie.

But Clint Eastwood’s latest ﬁlm-
making venture, “Invictus,” is all of
the above.

Instead of struggling to ﬁt into
one category, “Invictus” ﬁnds a way
to be all three simultaneously with-
out becoming a confusing cluster
of genres.

Based on John Carlin’s book
“Playing the Enemy: Nelson Man-

dela and the Game That Changed
a Nation,” “Invictus” tells the story
of 1995 South Africa. It shows the
country’s struggle with the ramiﬁ-
cations of apartheid, including its
divisions along racial and economic
lines, and newly elected President
Nelson Mandela’s attempt to bring
the country together by rallying it
behind a rugby team.

The ﬁlm’s premise would be
completely implausible if it weren’t

true.

Mandela (Morgan Freeman)
ﬁnds himself in a tricky situation
— part of the country counts on him
to succeed, while the other hopes
he will fail. '

He sees that rugby in South
Africa is a white man’s'sport, and
that blacks view it as one of the last
symbols of apartheid.

Mandela asks the South African
rugby team’s captain, played by Matt

Damon, to win the World Cup, a feat '

no one thinks possible.

He believes that by convincing
the country to support_its team in
the World Cup, he will convince it
to forget theold divisions of apart-
heid.

In typical Eastwood fashion, the
story takes time to develop. The
ﬁlm starts out slow, building Man-

, dela’s case for uniting the country

by showing how severe the divide

Eastwood creates a perpetually tense at-

. mosphere, mostly attributed to scenes involv-

ing Mandela’s’ security detail. _ _
These scenes are frustratingly intense, and
you can’t help but wonder if Eastwood will ac-
tually rewrite history and kill off Mandela.
In particular, Tony Kgoroge as head of
security is almost unbearable, spending the
majority of the ﬁlm glaring at the audience.
Where Eastwood really shines is in his
portrayal of the actual rugby games. He

captures the emotions of the stadium with ,

ease and keeps thehscenes from becoming
too showy. ' h '

The viewer becomes invested in the team,
as if they are actually in the stadium. During
the ﬁnal game of the World Cup, tension ran
so. high that people in the theaterbegan cheer-
ing after a particularly good play on screen.

Matt Damon, while not outstanding as the
South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar,
gives a good performance.

It is Freeman as Mandela, though,who is
truly impressive.

Freeman plays Mandela gracefully, tak-
ing one of the most recognizable voices in
the United States and transforming it into a

- nearly ﬂawless South African accent.

The closing lines, “I am the master of my

fate; I am the captain of my soul,” sum up

the ﬁlm perfectly. Movie-goers will leave the
theater feeling like they’ve just watched their
favorite team win, regardless of sporting pref-
erence.

On the whole, “Invictus” shines as an in-
spiration to viewers.

Anderson ‘heart and soul of band’

Anderson 4 1 —

week, if band wasn’t enjoyable,
he said, nobody would stick
around.

“It has to be fun,” Anderson
said. “Because if it’s not fun, and
they don’t enjoy doing it, and
they don’t use it as their outlet,
they’re going to find something
else to do. We just have a good
time together.”

“Band is a lot of work, but it’s
fulﬁlling. and gratifying,” Mal-
lit said. “Jack isn’t in-your—face

,. intense. He’s a silent intense;

'-
‘I

T

He doesn’t have to yell at you or
get up in your face. You want to
perform your best to meet his
expectations.”

According to Mallit, Anderson
is a grandfather ﬁgure, almost
family.

The rapport between teacher
and student runs deep in band,
so much that Anderson invites
members over every year for
Thanksgiving dinner. Because
Pitt usuallyplays a game around
Thanksgiving, some members of
the squad can’t return home to
see family over break.

Anderson said that 10 people
showed up for dessert this year.

“Thanksgiving happened
to be my birthday this year, so
they brought candles and cake
and sang ‘Happy Birthday,”’ An-
derson said. “I don’t want them
sitting alone [on Thanksgiving].
My house is always open.”

Anderson knows ﬁrsthand the
work band members must put in,
because he played in the varsity
marching band in the late ’60s
and early ’70s.

He recalled the band outper-

._ forming the football team in his

.-

6

college years.

“We got killed. in football in
Miami in 1968,” he said. “But the
Pitt band got a standing ovation
that night in the Orange Bowl.
Pitt wasn’t very good at that time
— we saw a lot of 1-9 seasons —
but the band got a lot of recogni-
tion because it was very good.”

The Anderson family has
strong ties to Pitt. Both of Jack’s
daughters attended the Uni-
versity and marched, his sister
played in the concert band and
his father was the program’s as-
sistant director.

“I grew up on the sidelines
from 1950 on,” he said. “So I’m
approaching 60 years basically
with the band.”

In turn, the University has
been kind to him. Anderson met
his wife as an undergraduate.

Currently, Anderson has a lot
on his plate. As director of bands,

he heads the varsity marching '

band, pep band and symphonic
band and logs hundreds of miles
traveling to away games. He is
the only full—time employee of
the department. '

I Anderson thanked alumni vol-
unteers and associate director Dr.
Mel Orange. ~

“The people that come in to ﬁt
uniforms, the people who come in
at night to set up ladders and yard
markers for practice  They’re
all volunteers,” Anderson said.

Anderson also guest conducts
for the Pennsylvania Music Edu-

» cators Association, an organiza-

tion that adjudicates middle and
high school bands. Because Pitt
doesn’t have a school of music,
Anderson has a tougher job re-H
cruiting members.

“[The PMEA] is a recruiting
process for us,” Anderson said. “I
get out into the schools and meet
the honors band students, the
best students in the area. Hope-
fully they meet me and say, ‘Well
maybe I’d like-to go to Pitt.”’

McGaughey remembers An-
derson recruiting him.

“I was a drum major for two ,
years in high school, loved my
band and never thought that it
could.get any better,” he said. “I

definitely did not want to join a

college band. When I was visiting
the engineering school here,Jack
got in touch with me and asked
me to come andtalk to him about
joining the band. I decided I
would go just to humor him. In
less than an hour he talked me
into joining.”

In part because of his bond
with his pupils, Anderson has
won several awards in the past
few years. Kappa Kappa Psi, a
national college band frater-
nity, awarded him the Distin-
guished Service To Music Medal
for marching band in 2007, and
other groups have awarded him

. similar honors. Pitt’s Greek Life
named him Professor of the
Year in 2006 and 2007.

But Anderson believes the
awards belong toothe entire Pitt

 

_ perform,” he said. “I just kind
of steer the ship andmake sure
we stay on course?’ _

And thoughehe turned .62 last

  
 

month, Anderson has lndplans 

‘hold up.”

McGaughey, who graduates
this spring, hopes‘ future Pitt .
band members havethe chance -I
to work with Anderson.
