Health Service Starts Information Network

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s student health service will
add some new programs this fall in
a campaign to increase student
awareness, according to health
educator Bob LaCivita.

“Prevention is the key," said
LaCivita, who plans to increase
literature available to students, add
new courses on health topics of
interest to students and schedule
events like a bi-yearly health fair.

“We had a fair this spring and it
was very. successful,” LaCivita
noted. He said the fall fair will
follow the same lines and feature
booths set up by different health

care/organizations with special

displays and brochures.

In addition, LaCivita is launching
a blitzkrieg of flyers upon the
dormitories and other university
buildings_ that will center on a
different health topic every two
weeks.

“We’ll place the flyers in places
where the students will be sure to
read them,” said LaCivita, -“like by
the elevators, on bulletin boards
and bathroom mirrors.”

“I want to set up an information
network across campus,” LaCivita
explained. “I’ll send out the
information on one page ﬂyers
through the dorms, fraternities and
to student media over two week
periods.”

Another new addition will be a
student health handbook, deve-

loped by the student health
advisory board and its chairperson
Dawn Gideon. LaCivita said the
booklet would contain information
important for incoming students.
The Health _Service will again
offer behavioral programs for
students. The programs, under the
direction of LaCivita and his
graudate assistant, Larry Sutton,
will focus on topics students are
interested in learning about. They
were selected after a poll of student
opinion determined the topics that
would generate the maximum
interest, according to LaCivita.
The programs are tentatively
titled as follows: Stress and
Suicide, Family Planning in the
Dormitories (under the direction of

Jan DeVoe and assistant Janet
Hague), Nutrition and - Weight
Control, Physical Fitness and
Cigarette Smoking.

LaCivita said that the student
surveys revealed a great deal of
interest in learning about cancer,
but no program will be centered on
the disease.

LaCivita said he would continue
with having freshmen fill out data
to determine their health risk
profiles. The process weighs
personal data with-statistics and
tries to determine vulnerable areas
in the student's personal health
care program.

“We have a new group, called
Peer Health Educators, and they're
going to be primarily concerned

with explaining the‘ health risk
profiles to students,” he said.
“It‘s true that most students who

fill out the profiles are in good ‘

health, but certain risk factors
become important as you get older.

LaCivita said that Pitt students
tend to have knowledge on health
care equivalent with college stu-

dents across the country. He cited-

a 10 question quiz given to

freshmen last fall on alcohol in '

which the average score was 76
percent—“Which is very good,”
he said. ‘

ested in is becoming more visible in

Gays and Lesbians Make Plans for Prideweek

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer
Most of the plans have been
made for__ the Pittsburgh area
celebration of Lesbian and Gay
Pride Week, according to a
spokesperson for the event. The
festivities, which will feature a

variety of events, begin June 15

and continue through June 24.

Gay Supporters at Pitt are among
the many groups sponsoring the
event.

The spokesperson said the
purpose of the event is to “show
unity” among the gay community
and to make a public statement
concerning gay rights.

“One of the purposes is to make
a statement to the public especially
in the wake of recent anti-gay
rights actions,” she added.

According to an information
sheet about the event, the week
will mark the tenth anniversary of
the Stonewall Rebellion.

The Stonewall Rebellion occur-
red in June, 1969, and involved a
confrontation between New York
City police and four hundred
homosexuals. The homosexuals
were angered over arbitrary attacks
by the police on members of the
gay community, according to the
information sheet.

(‘The Stonewall Rebellion in
June 1969 was the spark which
ignited a massive explosion of gay
men’ and lesbiaps in active

resistance against gay oppres-
sion,” the sheet said.

The week will be climaxed by a
march that starts in Shadyside and
ends at Schenley Oval, followed by
a rally and picnic there featuring
speakers from various organiza-
tions throughout the city.

The spokesperson stated that 300
to 500 people are expected to
attend the march and rally.

The week’s events are not just
for gay people, she added, using

the “The Word is Out,” a movie
comprised of interviews of 26 gay
men and women, as an example.

The film will be shown at Carlow
College June 21 and 22 at 7:45 and
10:15 p.m.

“We picked a place where
straight people would feel comfor.
table,”-she said.

Some of the other events to occur
during the week are a gay poetry
reading, a dance, and a “day in the
park” picnic.

Like the stage mother who pulls her klutzy
daughter out of the school play becausethe child was
assigned the role of Mushroom, Penn State has with-
drawn its basketball team from the Eastern Eight.

Under pressure from Nittany Lion coach Dick
Harter, school officials announced late last week the
12-18 Lions would seek roundball fame and, impor-
tantly, fortune as an independent. With a 1979-80
schedule that includes the likes of Muhlenberg, Ur-

sinus and Indiana of Pennsylvania, it’s for certain 1

Penn State won’t acheive either in the near future.
Penn State athletic director Ed Czekaj made the

announcement at the annual Eastern Athletic

Withdrawing from the Eastern Eight in order to gain roundball fame a fortune
may not have been a sound move for Penn State.

On The Run

By MARIA SC/ULLO

Association meeting, “We felt that it was in the best
interests of Penn State’s basketball program to with-
draw from the membership in the Eastern Eight. We
have set very high goals for our basketball program
and we feel those goals can best be acheivedas an in-

dependent.’ ’

 What Will Nittany Lions Gain by EAA Withdrawal?

would pull out of the league, many believed Czekaj

Harter came to Happy Valley after gaining
national prominance withhis University of Oregon
teams. Several weeks ago, when it was rumored PSU
would not bow to Harters wish to go independent.
After all, a first—year coach whose squad depended
upon slowdowns in all games to avoid annihilation

could hardly be expected to carry clout. Joe Paterno,
he’s not. «

But Harter has taken the first step toward building
what he believes will be a winning tradition at Penn
State. At the same time, he displayed a lousy sense of
timing for the announcement. In the midst of chaos
incurred by television negotiations for the league and
numerous proposals by EAA representatives, Penn
State’s little surprise will not be easily forgotten or
forgiven by the remaining EAA members.

The Eastern Eight Minus One is reportedly sear-
ching for a replacement team, preferably Syracuse,
St. John’s or one of a number of prestigious East
Coast schools. A

“We won’t miss Penn State,” said Panther
assistant coach Cleve Edwards. “If they want to pull
out, that’s up to them. It won’t kill us.” a
, If a replacement is not added immediately, the
league will go with its usual format but the regular
season league champion will receive a first-round
bye to the post—season championship tournament.

Other matters on the EAA meeting agenda in-

cluded a proposed television package and the for- —
mation of an Eastern Eight officials pool. Last _

season,‘ the league used ECAC officials, to the

‘dissatisfaction of more than a few coaches.

The league would like to televise some Saturday
afternoon games next season, with two tournament
games also to be broadcasted. - ,

‘had embraced not only basketball but baseball,
-cross-country and wrestling as well, has let go of
wrestling and will reportedly add soccer or indoor."
