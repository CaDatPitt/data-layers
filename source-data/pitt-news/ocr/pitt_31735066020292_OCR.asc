Walk-a-thon will assist   rape victims

By Patty Vishnesky
The Pitt News

Rape and other such offenses
have been closeted up and put out of
mind for many years, but when you
are a victim, dealing with the night-
mare can be’ frightening.

The Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape, a nonprofit organization, for
the past 12 years has been helping
victims of rape and other such
offenses through‘ their trauma by
providing a 24-hour hot line, coun-
seling and other services. M M

The organization was founded by
community professionals who real-
ized that some victims of attack hid

“their problem for years before talk-
ing about it.

“The backbone of ‘the organiza-
tion is the volunteers,” said Joanie
Olin, fundraising chairman of the
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.

Holding a wide range of educa-

tional degrees, volunteers act as’

medical and legal advocates who
meet with victims, ease them back
into control and prepare them for
counseling, police questioning if
they wish to press charges and court
procedures if necessary.

“The workers at the center make a
great sacrifice. considering their
education,” said Olin. “Since
August, 800 victims have contacted
them.” '

Reagan, Bush break from campaign

, .
WASHINGTON (UPI) — The I984
presidential candidates\ spent a rela-
tively quiet weekend while their run-
ning .. mates continued diligently
along the campaign trail. _
Although President Reagan spent
the weekend at Camp David, he still
found time" to speak to radio7listen-
ers. He told them ,of the need to
improve." the ‘_nation’s educational
system, "and also ‘made a point of
warning students/against ‘ watching
too‘ much television. “You can grow
by reading a book,” he said, but not
by watching a “situation comedy.”

date Walter F. Mondale stayed com-

pletely out of" the limelight this ‘

weekend. Instead, he worked on a ,
broadcast speech as well as details of
a deficit-reduction plan that he will
unveil today. \
However, Mondale’s _running
"mate Geraldine Ferraro was‘ out
campaigning in New England. In

* Portland, Maine, she suggested that

—Reagan may be planning. to elimi-
nate Social Security if reelected. She
made by White House Aide'Edwin
Meese and challenged the adminis-

tration to “come clean.”

Inside Today  

I

Vice President Bush also hit the
trail. He spent all day Saturday
promoting the Reagan-Bush ticket
before a partisian group in Detroit.
While addressing the Republican
Convention of Michigan, Bush

' stressed the importance of maintain-

ing President’ Reagan’s strong
defense policy. He told the_gathering
that the best way to ensure world

peace was to reelect Reagan in

November.

In an indirect attack at Mondale.
also referred to recent comments

Bush said, “Weaknessand vacilla-
tion will not keep the peace.”Bush

.

went on‘ to blame Congress for a
“large share” of the federal deficit.

Currently, the polls show an

uphill battle for the Democrats._

"However, Mondale’s campaign
manager defended the candidate’s
standing by saying that Mondale is
leading or tied with Reagan in.20
states. Robert Beckel conceded Rea-
gan is ahead in 30 states — “maybe.”

Mondale’s home stateof Minne-
sota may be one of those listed in the
Reagan column. A poll published in
a St.. Paul newspaper has Reagan

‘leading Mondale 47 to 40Vpercent.

Trees Hall
hours cut,

  
  
 

. By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

This year, Pitt studentsmay
experience some inconvenience
when attempting to utilize Trees
Hall for recreational purposes.
The School of Education budget
has been cut by $30,000 — mean-
ing that students will have 14
fewer hours per week to make
qse of the pool and weight room.

Dr. Ken Metz of the health,
phys-ed and recreation program,
admits that the staff is
disappointed.

“We’re interested in making it
[Trees Hall] available for the
maximum amount of hours,”
Metz said.

Whether this schedule change
will become permanent is not yet
known. The budget for fiscal
year ’84-85 has been set, but the
administration may be able to 
restore some recreational hours » 
by asking students working at ‘ ‘-
Trees Hall who are eligible, to’
apply for work/ study. This
would recover money for the
recreational program. _

“It [the current schedule]
could change as we get clearer
information on the eligibility of
current employees,” Metz

-revealed.

Metz added that this idea may ‘ 4
not recover enough funds due to ~
the fact thatstudents working for
Trees Hall must have certain
qualifications. *

“We just can't have any stu-
dent. Guards must be certified
through the American Red Cross
and our own water safety pro-
gram. Some of our supervisory
positions have special training
programs, also.” '

 

J On the question of whether
there wouldbe further cuts in the , ._ .
future, Metz seemed optimistic.  ' :gf

\ “I would hope there would be
enough unhappiness over the
current cut that there would be
no more.” “

 

_ Athletic Department Admin- ..
istrative Assistant Dan May said .. "
that the cuts were made in places ' ‘S 5'
where they should cause the least
yiconvenience. ,

By this time, most readers of The Pitt News have heard about
or read about and are tired ofthe Bill Fralic interview ( The Pitt
News Orientation Issue). Whathad started as a simple college
paper interview suddenly took offand received national atten-

across the country, not for its finejournalism, but rather for its
shock value, thanks to Pittsburgh’s largest news daily, The

ear ltOI',

All in all, the article is rather innocuous and is fairly typical
of college sports interviews, until Fralic was asked the hack-

neyed question, “What do you do in your spare tirne?”_His‘

response was not unlike one that any other college student
«might have given. The foul language was edited in the standard
vowel-omission style of editing to spare the eyes of our more
sensitive readers. ‘

The trouble started when the Press got hold of the story. The
reporter for The Pitt News also worked for the Press, so they
had an early copy of it. The Press read it and wrote a feature
piece centered entirely on one question in a college newspaper.

The response given by Fralic was questioned by the Pit!
News’ reporter as to whether or not Fralic minded, it being
quoted; according to the reporter, Fralic said, “if you can put

all term and had sworn I was going
to treat myself to at least one week's
vacation. I never even heard what

the guy had said to me, but he
thanked me for my patience, assured
me he would come back with his,wife
and headed for the door. I went to
my boss and told him I had to quit.
He just looked up from his newest
issue of Soldier ofFortune and said,
“_Okay, Michael. Fine have a good
time at school, I guess.”

Great. It was the sunny shores of
Florida for this boy. I had originally
planned a much more exotic trip for
myself, but things got complicated. -

The west coast of Florida wasn’t so

bad: quiet beaches, palms whisper-
ing in the wind, lots of rum, cold
beer and sport. I knew I’d better
pack a lot of Hemingway.

I caught the first People Express
ﬂight to Sarasota. The -stewardess
wheeled her cart down the aisle.
“Would you care for-anything?” she
asked. I ordered a beer and looked

down the aisle. I could see all those
greedy faces staring back waiting to
devour her goodies. “Better make it
three, it might take you a while to get
back,” I said. With this, the seat in
front of me tilted back. “All right!”

cried a good old boy sitting in front
of me, showing me two cans of
Michelob, one empty and one well

on its way to joining  “Hi, I’m
Curt. This is my first ﬂight. I guess
I’m a little nervous,” he said as he

polished off the last of his beer. I
offered him one of mine.

All the cultural differences were
drowned as the flight approached
Florida. Taken by my plight as a
poor college student headed for

Florida tojam three months of vaca-
tion int_o ’ less than 14 days, Curt
asked if he could show me Florida as
a native. How could I refuse? We got

off the plane and headed for the
parking lot where Curt said his car
would be, but first he had to claim
his .375. “Don'tjgo nowhere without

this thing. With three Gs on you, you .

need it,” he said, tapping the barrel

of the gun to his boot. Who could _

argue with such clear logic?

Curt’s car was the antithesis of the

Florida redneck.—_ a powder blue
Buick Wildcat convertible. This

meant trouble. He started the car
and pulled into a drive-thru liquor
store. We picked up Curt‘s brother

and sister and two girl friends and
headed south.

With the top down and music
blasting, I couldn’t even remember
Pennsylvania, much less my summer

—— job. I was a Northerrr college boy

with Jewish parents racing through
the night, swilling bourbon in the
back seat with the sister of an armed
cracker I met four hours ago. I was
going to have the time of my life or
die trying. Either way, I was sure to
let off a little steam before heading
North.

This is all part of what I believe to
be the full college experience. Not
necessarily the drinking or the crazi-
ness on a blind trip to Key West, but

I
l

breaking loose and trying something I

new. Trying something you’ve
wanted to do and thought you

could, but never have. Society.

almost expects college students to be
somewhat anti-establishment‘, to do
things a little differently than they’ve

always seen it done, to be .a bubble
off plumb. It's college, take a
chance. If you fall down, pick your-
self up, wipe off_ your nose and go
back to the academic nine—to-five,‘
but at least try. '

 

This story is more fact than
‘fiction though the names have
been changed to protect the
ignorant. The full story will be
published in full with the mor-
alizing furnished for The Pitt
News. The Pitt News Hopes to

story for your enjoyment.

 

  your calcultor in the sme 

class you are?

Move up to the TI-66. The easy 512 step programmable.

You’re into higher math and your old
calculator helped get you there.

But now it’s time for something more.
The TI-66 from Texas Instruments. The
Tl-66 offers full programming power and
ﬂexibility so you can solve complex and
repetitive math problems quickly, easily
and with fewer keystrokes than you
thought possible. Its 512 merged pro-
gram steps and over 170 built-in
scientiﬁc, engineering and statistical
functions make for powerful program-

   

ming. And the sleek, streamlined design

- makesforeasyuse. .

Its Algebraic Operating System makes
it easy on your brain by allowing you to

Crystal Display not only makes it easy

notation of your program steps so you
can make easy modiﬁcations as you

go along. There are large, readable keys
for your ﬁngers, and an easy—to-follow

  

 

guidebook so you shouldn't get confused.
And last, but certainly not least, at a
suggested retail of $69.95, there’s a price
that's easy on your pocketbook.

All in all, if we made the TI—66 pro-
grammable calculator any easier to use,

it would deserve its own degree. W p

Lack of jail space setting

prisoners free on parole

(UPI) — The number of convicts
on parole from federal and state
prisons has reached record propor-
tions. Justice Department ﬁgures
show that the number reached
250,000 last year.

In their report tracking the popu-
lations of state and federal prisons,
the department’s Bureau of Justice
Statistics also revealed today that
the number of adults currently on
probation has topped 1.5 million.

The agency claims that since I979,
the number of people placed on
court probation has increased 38
percent. On the other hand, the
growth of the prison population is
currently 39 percent.

Agency spokesman Larry Green-
feld has attributed the substantial
increase in both parole and proba-
tion to the fact that state prisons are
releasing a lot of inmates prema-
turely due to overcrowding.

In a related story, one inmate is
still unable to receive parole, despite
his efforts.

James Channey, an inmate at the
State penitentiary in Walla Walla,
Washington, has come up with a
bizarre proposal as a way of repay-
ing his debt to society. Channey said
he would like to donate a kidney in
exchange for his premature release.

If released, Channey would be five
years ahead of his l989_parole date
which he received for a gas station
robbery. Earlier, he unsuccessfully
attempted to sell one of his kidneys
Ior $15,000. Channey claims that
prisoners would make the perfect-
organ donors.

“I don't think that you’d find a
healthier bunch of people than
you’ve got here in prison,” Channey
said. “You have to stay healthy to
protect yourself." In response to the
unique proposal, the state parole
board considered the chances of
Channey’s being taken seriously as
“zero."

Hours cut at Trees

continued from page one

“We reduced the hours in two
areas based on past performance
and usage.”

Swimming coach Bradshaw
agreed that the cuts were made
judiciously.

“Freeman passed down the
mandate to cut, and Dean Kelly
tried his best to cut where it
would hurt the least,” Bradshaw
said.

This is the first time in 18 years
that there has been a change in

Hall

the Trees Hall recreational
schedule. If students have any
complaints about the availability
of both the pool and the weight
room, they should contact Dean

Kelly.

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Billy Knight came horrie Sat-
urday night. The former Pitt All-
America and 14 other pros from
the National Basketball Associa—_,-
tion dazzled asparse Civic Arena
crowd in an exhibition known as
the Stroh’s Classic.

No doubt, the NBA’s big boys
had fun. Defense took 'a back
seat to dazzling layups by Atlan-
ta's Dominique Wilkins, pin-

point passing by former West. a

Virginia standout Greg Jones
and sweet slams by the San
Antonio giant, 7-2 'Artis
Gilmore.

But were MVP honors to go
out, the bearded Knight would
reap the fruits of his efforts.

’ Leading the Tri-State All-Stars
to a 171-165 victory over the '

USA All-Stars, Knight led all
scorers with 36 points. One
expects that kind of effort from

an 11-year veteran, the last Pitt A

basketball standout to lasso All-
America honors.

The night, however, was not
one to lay claim to magnificent
doings as much as to reminisce a
bit. Ten years have passedsince
Knight nearly single-handedly
put the Panthers in the national
spotlight. Venture back to the
1973-74 season, during which
Pitt amassed a 22-game winning
streak before losing to eventual
NCAA champion North Ca-ro-
li-na State in the Eastern,
Regionals.

Yeah, the Panthers went 27-4
that year, actually made the final
eight and finished the year
ranked seventh by the wire ser'-.
vice polls. A
' “The big thing about that team
is that it was all local guys,"
Knight said, “because we were in
Sports Illustrated as seeing home

V from the top of Mt. Washington.

That was the big media thing as
far as our team was concerned.”

Baldwin's Mickey Martin and
Crafton’s Jim Bolla, a short (6-7)
center, played for coach Charles
“Buzz” Ridl. Included, too, were
Tommy Richards, Kirk Bruce -
now a: Pitt women’s basketball

assistant —— and sixth man Ken

Wagoner. ’

After losing its opener to West .

Virginia, Pitt reeled off_ 22
straight victories before losing

two straight to South Carolina 

and Penn State. Then’ came
playoff wins—*o’ver St. Joe’s and
Furman — and national
prominence. «  ‘
“We did it without a domi- I

nant, big man," Knight con}, .‘

tinued. “[Bolla] was outplayed ~
by the seven-footers like ‘Walton.
‘But we made up for it in ‘team
play, knowing each other and
playing a passing-type offense.

. It’s funny now, because in the

pros a lot of teams are going’to a
multiple defense that we ranfo
years at Pitt;-{’ O . '
Knight made a deep impres-
sion on Ridl during his playing
days at Braddock H_igh School..
The in-town, recruiting eventu:
ally paid off. Although there isa
smattering of Knight in the Pitt

. record books (he is now known '

as the fourth all-time leading

scorer and holder of several field '

goal records), perhaps he’s better,
remembered for boosting Pitt's

first return to the NCAAs since

1957. ' _ *

The Panthers extinguished’
their first two playoff opponents
by I2 and three points, respec-
tively. NCSU, however, nixed’
any Final Fourdreams Pitt had
by drubbing the Panthers I00-
72, on its homecourt in Raleigh,
no less. ‘_ A ‘ 

“It was a great time to,be

i .there,’’ Knight said. “It was a u-

nique situation, period,»-because

of tough playing on their home-
court. though.” . -
Also‘_-(in the Wolfpack’s favor
was 7-4 ‘center Monty Towe and
the explosive forward tandem of
David Thompson and Tom
Burleson. Thompson suffered a

near tragedy in the first‘ half 3
when he ﬂipped over a team- '

mate, opening a gash in his head
as he hit the floor.

“When Thompson fell, that
was pretty dramatic for both
teams,” Knight recalled. “He
didn’t play anymore, but what
was ‘unique was that after they
patched him up, he came out and
gave the .team a real emotional
lift. A standing ovation — they
went crazy."

If being part of a champion-
ship contender didn't rouse
Knight, then his performance
against UCLA in his junior year.
surely did. Pitt d-idn’t defeat the
Bruins, in Pauley Pavilion, that
day in late 1972. Still, Knight

« poured in an amazing 37 points.

“It’s always a big game when

you play UCLA, but it was kind
of funny because we all were in

, rental cars," Knight began. “Our

car [with Ridl and then-sports
publicist Dean Billick] got lost so
we didn’t get to the game until
the national anthem. I didn't get
to warm up or stretch.

_ “Just as they got ready to
throw the ball up, I came out of

v.-the locker room. I started_and

had a great‘ game. Maybe I
should come late to every game,
because the type of game'I had
there was unique.”

Indiana made Knight its first-, ..

round draft pick in.‘74. He spent
three years with the Pacers
before lolling around in Buffalo
and Boston (ABA) for a year and
a half. After four and a half more
years as a Pacer, Knight moved
to Kansas City, where he’ll start
his second season. , e 

Knight played primarily as a
forward at Pitt but switched to
swingman in the pros when

_ teams started drafting power for-

wards. Already'he’s eclipsed the
13,000 point mark in his pro
career.

His playing weight hasn't
changed drastically. Knight left
Pitt in the 195-198 range and is
now a shade under 210.

Knight never did play as a
freshman, during the days of
first-year ineligibility. But -he
went on to start for three years at
Pitt and played in three NBA
All-Star matchups.

Nowadays, he'll admit that

being a part of the NBA elite “is
exciting because that's a per-
sonal, individual achievement.
You don't aim for them, you
don’t strive for them, but ‘when

they happen, they're nice to come
_ upon a player.” , 1
Sounds mellow, like a Billy

Knight trademark. Yet in the
end, when quizzed on what stood

out in his Oakland playing days, .-

Knight shifts his eyes upward
and speaks his mind. -
“When you’re in college, those
are the best years of your life," he
said. “You ‘don't have all the

Secondary coach Dino Folino
likens Oklahoma's version of the
wishbone to something Southern
Methodist coach Bobby Collins
used against Pitt in the Mus-

Bowl. I
‘ “It was a similar. concept,”
Folino said. “It hurt us because
since they didn't throw as often
as we thought they would, we
came in to support the run. Then
it's second and 22, we're reasdy
for the pass and they run."
By now the lesso-n is
elementary. _ I I
“We have to put the kids
through who willstop the run,"
Folino continued, “and who will
be there to hold back the pass‘.
We must watch for over-
agressiveness when a'ltacking the
line of scrimmage: Then the
quarterback is open to throw
freely." ' - '

Danny Bradley,_ a second-year
signal caller from good ole Pne
Bluff, Ark. Bradley did pass for
1,269 yards last season, a very
unspectacular amount. But when
coach Barry Switzer has a three-
back offense that so character-
acterizes the wishbone, lots of
things can happen. You get more
eligible blockers for one; screen
plays galore for two; and, for
three, a halfback who fits the

V wishbone to a “T.”

His name i-s Spencer Tillman,
the first freshman last year to
rush for more that 1000 yards in
Oklahoma history. He ﬁnished
with 1,047 yards even after miss-
«ing a game with a back injury.

‘ itching to meet up with this Okla-
homa sophomore.

“I'll be mostly run-support,”
the converted running back from
New Kensington said. “I'll be an
alley-man, trying to shut down
the attack from the outside.

“Is it better to play the wish-
bone?" He then asked rhetori-
cally. “As a defensive back I like
to play a team that passes a lot.
That's why we're here. The chal-
.lengc is there. That's why ‘we
hav.°._,to meet it." ,

Sitting pretty in the dog days
of August and three weeks
removed from the vagaries of yet
another football season, Foge
Fazio spoke. He happened upon
the conclusion that, ever since Ed
Bozik assumed the Pitt athletic
directorship three summers ago,
the schedule has become increas-
ingly difficult.

‘ True, those were Fazio’s
words more or less. The theory,.a
proven one at that, wasn’t lost on
another college football mover
and shaker, Beano Cook.
Employed by ABC-TV as a wee-
kend analyst, Cook made spe-
cific reference to Saturday’s

Cook, 10 and behold, may
have given credence to his part-

In retrospect, Fazio said the
coaches didn't “coach" well
enough and .that “the kids” were
. not to be blamed.

“Coach Fazio is taking too
much of the blame," Congemi
said, as if in court. “We were pre-
pared. We were ready for the
BYU defense. We just didn’t play
well.‘I didn't play a particularly
good game. Neither did the
offense.”

‘Hopefully not lost in all this is
that Congemi sat’ out of practice
till Friday last week, nursing a
bruised thigh back to health as
well as normal color.

"‘lt’s a tough thing working
hard all summer, getting ready to
play Brigham Young and then
not being able to perform like the
offense should, and knows it
can," Congemi continued. “The
offense has a lot to prove. The
Pitt team has a lot to prove."

coaching staff plot ways for the

The Pitt women's volleyball team
began its autumnal drive for the elu-
sive Big East title in the hoped-for
style by defeating an experienced
squad Saturday in Fitzgerald Field

So you want to know what hap-
pened in the world of sports dur-
ing the weekend? Get a rundown
on various events, beginning on

been, a first-match victory signifies a
shiny new beginning for a hungry
team.

'Pitt used to be h_ome to all the
members of the visiting team at_ one
time .or another, but the changes in
the campus and ‘the coach were
dramatically apparent to at least two
members of the alumni squad.

“The field house looks great,” said
'80 ‘graduate Cindy Chambers, giv-
ing a sweeping gesture to the new
scoreboards and bleachers.’ “The
campus looks just beautiful — the ‘
frat houses, and especially the [Wil-
liam Pitt] Union.”

Nineteen-‘eighty two graduate
Paula Olsen, who now coaches high
school volleyall in New York,
enjoyed returning to Pitt. “I am
excited to be here in Pittsburgh,”she
said. “I got goosebumps and a funny
feeling in my stomach on the way
here. _ V M

“Usually; you go your separate
ways and say ‘let’s get together,’ but
your never do. I think this is a great
opportunity to get together,” Olsen
said. '

Chambers said she had the “jit-

ters” when she first got here. “You

’called the“ experience of seeing

former teammates “neat." She

added, “I think this is a great idea of

[Collier’s].” I .
Chambers is - now a corporate

health consultant, with a bachelor’s ~

degree in biological science and a
master's degree in exercise physiol-
o‘gy. While a graduate student at
Pitt, she assisted Collier in coaching
the ’80-81 teams, which included
Ulana Kohutiak, Judy Young and
Pat Belcher. She also helped recruit
Kris Wexell and Sally Gillespie.
“Judy started out with our junior
training team when she was 13-

years-old,” Chambers recalled. '

coaching now.” 1

The Philadelphian, who plays on
the East /Coast team of the US. Vol-
leyball Assocation, was impressed

with the ‘changes in Collier.

' “Shelton has a. phenomenal
knowledge of the game, the skills
and the fundamentals involved,”
Chambers stated. “I think it was his

“The first game was hairy — they
played tough,” Olsen said. “Ulana,
Judy, and Pat played a good game.
And, heck, we’re just a bunch of old
ladies out there.”

USVBA, but “nothing competitive.
We just finished the Empire State

Sooners Saturday

Pitt's Offense against Brigham
Young was near nonexistent two
Saturdays. That will have to P .
change in tiine for the Oklahoma
 invasion several days from now.
- « Story, page 16. n “

‘As the sun shed its burning rays
on Oakland Saturday afternoon, the
Pitt soccer team put Villanova away
in a similar fashion, shutting out the
Wildcats 2-0 in their first game of the
season.

The fans went wild as veteran Vic-

tor Hugo scored the first goal of the 

1984 season with several minutes
gone in the match. The second goal
was spurredwby a burst of speed and
a breakaway by Sherlund “Sparky"
Lucke, a returning senior. In his

one-on-one contest with the Wildcat '

goalie, Lucke showed him what it
meant to be a Panther. ‘

“Support, depth and a good atti-s
tude-made this win,” Lucke said
after the match.

'\
But the Panthers were not ﬂawless %

on the field, coach Joe Luxbacher
noticed. ’

“Although our defense played
well, the offense was having a prob-
lem with forward passes,” he
continued.

Luxbacher also said that he would
like to see_the offense play a more
creative game — create rather than
break, as the first-year head coach
put it. »

The players also‘ noticed what__ \
their weaknesses were and know "‘ \

what they will be practicing on for
their game two days from n6w
against St. Vincent.

The defense, on the other hand,’
played well. Goalie and captain
Dave Torrence stopped every shot
taken. Brian Casey handled the ball
almost‘ ﬂawlessly, and the entire
defense played with vigor, clearing
the ball when it had to. ,

It<was evident that the Panthers’
attitude was positive. The squad
gave support to each other whether
on the field or on the sidelines. The
depth of the team made it possible

for almost the whole team to play. ;;§~

A returning player, Joe Triglia,

' who displayed some brilliant foot-

work, said, “It was a good start. A
lot of effort and hardwt rk made this
a good win. There was a nice blend
moving on the field.” 1 .
Two things help make a good
tram: It's not winning or having
individuals , who are talented. A
group of players that work well
together and a team that has a good.
attitude provide the key combina-

tion. It just so happens that the§'W

Panthers do have talented individu-
als and are primed to win.
