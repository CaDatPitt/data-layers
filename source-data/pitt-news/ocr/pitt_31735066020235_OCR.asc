By Milt Klopfer

_ Staff Writer

Philip Moyer won the student gov-
ernment presidential election last
night, defeating opposing candidate
Jay Rothstein. -

sitions were Vince Altomare, Fiora
Boehm, Rose Cardone, Amy Dan-

WASHINGTON — The C-123K
cargo plane shot down a month ago
while flying supplies to Nicaraguan
Contra rebels was part of a secret
White House-initiated program that
relied on ex-intelligence operatives to
circumvent a ban on U.S. military
aid, according to sources involved in
the effort. j

The White House operation began
in early 1984 when President Reagan
approved a plan to replace CIA as-
sistance to the rebels with help from
Americans outside the government

and from U.S. military allies, current.

and former administration officials
and Contra leaders said.

The operation has received
renewed attention now that Eugene

Rothstein declined to comment.

Kontos, Boehm and Naro, the
board members who received the
most votes, will serve along with
Moyer on_ the university senate
councﬂ. '

”The turnout this year was lower

than it was last year,” said Carpenter. ‘

The number of presidential votes this
year was 2,174 — compared to last

_ year's 2,321.

Carpenter said he thought that this

year's election was quieter than last

year's. ”There didn't seem to be as
many posters,” he said. Carpenter
partially attributes the quiet to his be-
lief that not as many important issues
were raised this year.

Outgoing SGB Presidentlim Mum-
ma advised the newly elected board

A to ”work together and take their po-

sitions as seriously as possible.”

’’Congratulations, I think you're all
veryqualified and are going to do a
good job,” he said..

Hasenfus, the C-123K’s cargo handler
who parachuted from the plane and
was captured, has been put on trial
in Managua.

Although aspects of the White
House program had been disclosed
"previously, the Oct. 5 crash of the
arms-laden aircraft in southern

Nicaragua revealed a previously

secret supply network. The network
used American pilots and operated
out of El Sa|vador’s military airfield
at llopango. ‘ '
Sources inside both the supply net-

‘ work and the administration said U.S.

officials played a supporting role in
the operation — placing the ex-CIA
operative who directed the flights at
llopango and helping to coordinate

I the flow of supplies. The sources dis-

cussed the. U.S. role only onjthe con-
dition that they remain anonymous.

Administration officials have de-
nied responsibility for the flight and
professed ignorance about who was
behind it. _ .

Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of
state for Latin American affairs, told
Congress last month that it would be
”inappropriate” to investigate the
supply operation, which he de-
scribed as a ’/private initiative  not
organized, directed or financed by
the U.S. government.”

House and Senate intelligencel

committees have begun examining
the supply flights to see if the alleged
White ‘House ties constituted a vio-
Iation of a two-year congressional

ban on the U.S. government provid- -

ing military assistance to the Contras
fighting Nicaragua’s leftist Sandinis-
ta government.

According to a report prepared by

Felix Rodriguez, a private arms dealer
in the supply network, a former CIA
operative who uses the pseudonym
Max Gomez was placed at El Sal-
vador’s llopango military airfield by
Donald. Gregg, Vice President
George Bush's national security ad-
viser, and Nestor Sanchez, a senior
Pentagon official in charge of Central
American military aid programs.

The report said Rodriguez had
regular contactwith Bush's office.
Bush, who was ClA,director in 1976,
and Gregg, who was a top executive
there, have acknowledged meeting
with Rodriguez but deny directing
the supply-operation.

Hasenfus has said he believed he
was part of a covert operation mount-
ed by the U.S. . government and
directed -by two Cuban-Americans,
whom he knew as Max Gomez and

et in Nicaragua said to be U.S. spy plane

Ramon Medina and thought worked
for the CIA.

Hasenfus said he was recruited for
the operation by William Cooper,
who was killed in the crash. Cooper
and Hasenfus worked for the CIA-
owned Air America during the Viet-
nam War. Wallace B. SawyerJr., the
co-pilot who died in the plane,
worked at least until April for
Southern Air Transport of Miami, a
formerly CIA-owned company.

Flight logs kept by Sawyer showed
him flying Southern Air planes into
Central America, as well as piloting
other cargo planes into the U.S.-built
Contra airfield at Aguacate in-Hon-
duras. According to Pentagon re-
cords, Southern Air has emerged as
a leading contractor flying logistical

supplies for the Defense Department

WASHINGTON — Sunrise on Vet-
erans Day will unveil a 15-by-25-foot
floral flag at the Vietnam Veterans’
Memorial, containing a flower for
each American who died in that war,
organizers of the event said.

The flag of red, white and blue car-
nations and roses will be woven’
Monday night on the Mall directly
over the polished black granite
memorial dedicated there in 1982 to
the 58,113 Americans who lost their
lives in Vietnam, said Jan Scruggs, the
veteran who designed the
monument. .

”There will be a flower for every
_American who died there,” he said
Wednesday, adding that it will be
”unveiled by the sun” rising on Vet-
erans Day.

Scruggs spoke at a news confer-
ence called to discuss the construc-
tion of similar memorials to Vietnam
veterans throughout the United
States.

Reporters to be jailed
for refusal to testify

SAN DIEGO — A judge told two
television newsmen Wednesday that
they will go to jail unless they agree
to answer questions about their
coverage of a multiple murder case.

San Diego Superior Court Judge
Franklin Orfield gave J.W. August
and Steve Fiorina until Thursday to
back down from their refusal to an-.
swer questions posed by the defense
attorney for David Allen Lucas.

Lucas is scheduled to go on trial
Thursday for three of the six murd-
ers and one attempted murder for
which he has been charged.

Fiorina is a reporter, and August is
an assignment editor at KGTV~
Channel 10, the ABC affiliate in San
Diego. -

Both were found in contempt of
court Feb. 10 by Orfield and ap-
pealed the ruling, but it was upheld
in October.

Small plane hits jet
while landing in fog

TAMPA, Fla. — A twin-engine air-
craft hit a Pan American World Air-
ways jet on a fog-shrouded airport
taxiway yesterday, killing at least one
person aboard the small plane, offi-
cials said.

None of the 30 people on the Boe-
ing 727 were injured, said John
Whiteside, duty officer at the Feder-
al Aviation Administrationls region-
al office in Atlanta.

He said the Pan Am jet, Flight 301,

was taxiing out for a takeoff from
Tampa International Airport when the
twin-engine Piper Aztec crashed into
it.

”The Aztec landed and then taxied
off the runway and hit the Pan Ameri-
can plane on the taxiway, or that
Piper Aztec landed on the taxiway it-
self,” said Whiteside.

The taxiway borders runway 36L,
a lighted, north-south landing strip at
the regional airport.

Whiteside said visibility at the air-
port was limited to one-sixteenth of
a mile in heavy, fog.

The 24 passengers, three flight at-
tendants and the three—member flight
crew on the jetliner were taken back
to the terminal immediately after the
accident, Whiteside said.

Frog Gets Nearly
2,000 Votes in
County Race

LAWRENCE, Kan. —— A candidate
with the backing of environmentalists
gained 1,850 write-in votes in the

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, November 7, 1986

race for a seat on the Douglas County
Commission, even though her sup-
porters said the race was only a pub-
licity ploy.

The environmentalists’ candidate,
Agnes T. Frog, lost to Democratic in-
cumbent Nancy Hiebert, who had
4,886 votes in Tuesday's election.

Agnes was supported by environ-
mentalists who fear that the proposed
14-mile, $38 million South Lawrence
Trafficway Corridor could damage
the Baker Wetlands near_Lawrence.

The wetlands shelter the northern
crawfish frog, which could become
an endangered species.

Heibert supported the planned
bypass, saying an environmental en-
gineer inspected the route and con-
cluded that the wetlands are safe.

’’In my opinion, your espionage ac-

harm to the security of this nation,”
the judge told the Walkers.

He told the father, ”There is no
way anyone looking at you can help
but have an overwhelming feeling of

The sentences were" recommended
by U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L.

Poor more apt to getcancer

By Michelle Zollner

Sta ff Writer

The economically disadvantaged
are suffering from a higher incidence
of cancer than any other socio-
economic level, according to the
results of a special report recently
published by the American Cancer
Society.

The report, prepared by Donna P.
Funch of the State University of New
York at Buffalo, defined the term
”economically disadvantaged” to be
”those persons and groups who, be-
cause of economic, educational and
social disadvantages, do not enjoy
the same health status nor the full
range of health care received by the
mainstream of American society.”

Within the special report, Harold

Freedman of the American Cancer
Society gave reasons and examples
for why the economically disadvan-
taged have the problem of a higher
cancer incidence rate.

”The poor patient with potential
cancer is frequently seen first in the
emergency room rather than being
referred to a clinic,’' Freedman said.

”Often, long waiting periods and
complex registration procedures are
common,” he continued.

According to Freedman, a sympto-
matic patient is likely to be dis-
couraged when faced with a long
diagnosis process for what the patient
may perceive as a painless lump.

”The result is often late diagnosis
at an incurable state of the disease,”
Freedman said.

Freedman calls this ”malignant

neglect,” which ”constitutes a silent
death sentence for many thousands
of Americans each year.”

Another important finding in the
American Cancer Society's special
report was the higher incidence of
blacks dying from cancer compared
to whites.

”Among the low-income popula-
tion  that is, at identical low-income
levels for both racial groups, non-
white mortality rates were significant-
ly higher than white, while at identi-
cal middle and upper levels for both
racial groups, the two groups con-
verged.”

The special report addressed this
racial issue apart from the socio-
economic issue because ”there are
no large scale data bases available."

Salk: Human race is at
turning point in evolution

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Jonas Salk, the celebrated and for-
ward-thinking physician responsible
for the polio vaccine, spoke yester-
day of the need for more cooperation
among the people of the world if we
are to survive.

Salk was a member of the faculty
at Pitt in 1955 when he discovered
the killed-virus vaccine. He began his
work in immunology as an assistant
professor of epidemiology at the
University of Michigan School of
Public Health.

Salk participated in research on im-
munization against influenza at
Michigan that led to his work with
the polio virus. He is currently found-

ing director of the Salk Institute, es-
tablished to bring together biological
scientists interested in the social im-
plication of their work.

”|t’s a propensity some of us have,”
Salk said at his lecture, ”we see
things in a broader perspective.”

The lecture centered around Salk’s
examination of the trends in world
population and the, changes in atti-
tudes needed to cope with growth.

”We are perhaps in the adoles-
cence of of human development,” he
said. Salk went on to compare the
population growth of the human race
with similar curves for lemmings and
other animals. A A \ ’

He predicts that in another few
years, the population growth will lev-
el off and the birth and death rates
will be equal.

”All evolution follows the same

— type of graph as the other species,"

Salk contended, adding, ’’I see man
as the evolver of the future.”

Salk sees humans at a "turning
point” in their evolution, their values
changing in the next phase. He hopes
people will become more socially
aware in the future.

”We have a responsibility to the I

developing nations of the world," he

said. Salk is engaged in work with ,

-governments of Third-World coun-
tries to promote vaccination.

”What is happening is not a
change in perception,” Salk main-
tained, ”it is alchange in reality.”

”We might as well open ourselves
and change our way of living as well
as our way of thinking [about the
future].”

This year marks the eighth con-
secutive year in which the Pi Kap-
pa Phi fraternity is conducting a
PUSH-a-Thon here in Pittsburgh.

The PUSH-a-Thon begins at
noon today in front of the
Cathedral of Learning when Presi-
dent Posvar reads a proclamation
from the mayor declaring Nov. 7
and 8 PUSH Days“ in Pittsburgh.
Members of Pi Kappa Phi along
with members of the Kappa Kap-
pa Gamma sorority will be push-
ing a wheelchair for 24 hours
around the city.

PUSH (Pla_y Units for the Se-
verely Handicapped) is a nation-
al project of Pi Kappa Phi. It
provides recreational units
designed for severely handi-
capped children. Thomas Sayre
founded the organization in 1975

with the collaboration of psychol-

Pi Kaps raise charity
money for handicapped

ogists, administrators, direct care
personnel, electrical engineers
and carpenters. It now serves as
a forum for the improvement of
institutional environments.

Co-chairmen Patrick Maxwell
and Jeff Raichel, along with the
philanthropy chairman of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Terri Sahi, have
successfully organized this year's
fund-raising activities by exceed-
ing the amount the fraternity
raised last year.

Their activities included a car
smash during homecoming and
canning during the Steelers vs.
Bengals game. -

”|t’s good to get a variety of
ways in which to raise money, be-
cause it gives the cause more pub-
|icity,” Sahi said. ~

The PUSH-a-Thon will con-
clude at the Pitt vs. Miami game
after the wheelchair has been
pushed through Oakland, Squir-’
rel Hill, Shadyside and
Bloomfield.

Salvadoran telephone bills also

show repeated calls in September
from a safe house used by the sup-
ply network to White House phones
used by Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a
deputy director for political-military
affairs on President Reagan's National
Security Council.

Through a spokesman, North said
that "to his knowledge, [he] has
never received any phone calls from
the safe houses.” But a source close
to North said he would not necessar-
ily have known where calls were
coming from. Another source said

North helped ”facilitate” the flow of
supplies if the private network en-
countered problems.

For the past several years, North
has overseen U.S. support for the
Contras and, according to current and
former administration officials, pre-
pared a three-page plan in early 1984
for enlisting private Americans and
third countries to aid the Contras in
the face of a congressional cutoff.

According to those sources, then-
national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane outlined the plan orally to
Reagan and received the president's
approval. The plan then fell to North
to implement, the sources said.

Freeing hostages
can be too risky

The Reagan administration has told Iran that the seven-year U.S.
trade embargo on American—made weaponry may be eased if the re-
maining hostages in Beirut are released and if the Iranian government
ceases to lend support to international terrorism.

According to U.S. intelligence sources, the president's former na-
tional security adviser, Robert McFarlane, and other members of the
national Security Council staff have been secretly negotiating with
the Iranians for a year already. Reagan administration officials claim
that the offer to end the weapons embargo was the key element in
the release of David P. Jacobsen, a former Beirut hostage, and is sup-
posed to expedite the release of two more American hostages in
Lebanon.

It's wonderful to see some progress toward the release of the Ameri-
can hostages held in Lebanon. It seems as if the current administra-
tion really has been working on the situation for some time now. But
how wise is it to bargain with Iran? It is vital that the citizens held
hostage ‘in the Middle East be returned to the United States as soon
as possible. In order to accomplish this, negotiators sometimes have
to go to extreme lengths. But bargaining with Iran may be a bit too
extreme.

No one is saying that the United States has indeed given the Irani-

ans any arms yet, but isn't giving a gun to an insane person e or:

in this case, an insane nation — a little suicidal?

The Iranians have proven themselves time and time again, through
their rhetoric and their actions, that they are not worthy of our trust.
Supplying Iran with weapons will only serve to further escalate the
war between Iran and Iraq and could very well become the deciding
factor in the outcome of that war. If Iran should win, they could not
only increase the size of their country, they could increase their sphere
of influence, thereby spreading their form of Moslem Fundamental-
ism. Moslem Fundamentalism is not bad in itself, but the Iranian ver-
sion is extremely militant and anti-American. With more guns, what's
to stop them from walking all over us again? '

Democratic gains

may hurt Reagan

The ”Reagan Revolution” may very well have ended when the fi-
nal results of Tuesday's elections rolled in. The Democrats regained
control of the Senate and added to their already overwhelming posi-
tion in the House. Now they're in the position to push for the pro-
grams favored by the Democratic Party and to stop many of the ones
favored by the president.

Budget priorities may change, SDI faces stronger opposition,

defense spending may decrease, and plans to increase support to
”freedom fighters” the world over may find themselves shelved dur-
ing the next two years. President Reagan is in for one of the toughest
trials of his presidency.
‘ The latest election may spell an end to the Democrats’ troubles.
Any successes they may gain during the next two years could pave
the way to the Oval Office in 1988. But, on the other hand, their
gains inthe Senate may ruin their chances for a Democratic presi-
dent in the next election. ‘

President Reagan is perhaps the most popularpresident in recent
history. Ifthe Democrats in Congress give him too much trouble, the
American public may become disillusioned with the Democratic party

and vote Republican-the next time around. In order to avoid this,_

Congress must not oppose the president too often.

If the American people are ready to label the presidentas a lame
duck for the remainder of his term, they are mistaken. He strongly
believes in all of his programs and proposals and will not take oppo-
sition sitting down. He's shown this time and time again throughout

Star Wars isn't flawless

Several of the ”Star Wars” columns
in this paper have hailed SDI as the
final end to the Soviet nightmare: a
shield that will make the continental
United States safe from an ICBM
nuclear attack.

Unfortunately, the columnists

make the incorrect assumption that x

SDI will work 100 percent.

Let's listen in on the conversation
between two scientist-politicians, one
a Soviet, the other an American, dis-
cussing the feasibility of Reagan's SDI
shield. , ,

Soviet: ”So, Comrade Yankee, your
country is willing to spend trillions
of dollars to defend your continent
from a devastating nuclear attack.
Very noble.”

American: ”Wi|ling and able. Our
initial research has given us a varie-
ty of feasible weapons that can des-
troy |CBMs during their initial boost
phase and during the warheads’ re-
entry over our airspace. And the tech-
nology is in our grasp to develop
these weapons."

Soviet: ”I have no doubt you can.
And I am sure you can easily develop
a small system in less than a decade
that will prevent a small nuclear strike
on your country — perhaps even pre-
vent an all-out nuclear war from ‘start-
ing over the accidental firing of one
ICBM. Such a system would be good.
But, assuming that my comrades in
the Soviet Union do not decide upon
a massive nuclear attack before your
”space shield” is finished, are you

sure your SDI will give you a 100 per-

cent kill?”

American: ”Ninety percent would
be a more realistic figure.”

Soviet: ”Ah, so you don't mind if
about 1,000 warheads fall,.on your
cities and military installations. Or
100. Or even 10. You would rather
spend trillions to minimize your loss-
es on human lives instead of negotiat-
ing a bilateral disarmament of nuclear
weapons?"

‘American: ”SDl allows us to
negotiate in Geneva from a position
of strength, the only language your
countrymen seem to understand. Be-
sides, aren’t.you worried that SDI will
take away your position of global
dominance? Isn't that why you want
us to stop SDI—development?"

Soviet: ’’If the Soviet Union start-
ed developing a shield that would
make the U.S. nuclear arsenal virtu-
ally vunerable, wouldn’t you be wor-
ried about a first-strike that you
couldn't effectively retaliate to?
Nuclr-ear winter for all of us, eh? And
what as.surance_do we truly have that

will not be tempted to tryla first .

strike? Soviets love their children,
too.”

American: ”Yet your government
has also been doing research to de-
velop your own SDI technology.”

Soviet: ”We have. But we will not
spend trillions of rubles building a
technologically sophisticated
ICBM/warhead ' defense system. In-
stead, we will develop very cheap
means of disrupting your space shield
so it cannot work properly.”

American: ”And how do you plan
to acomplish that?” ‘

Soviet: ”Simple! Tell me, how do
you effectively defend a high-energy
laser or electromagnetic rail gun
satellite in orbit? You can't! No
granite mountains to hide it behind.
I could easily knock outyour billion-
dollar satellite with a million-dollar
anti-satellite missile or hundreds of
thousand-dollar space mines parked
earlier right next to your satellite. And
if you spend millions of more dollars
hardening your satellite or gold-
plating it with its own defensive sys-
tem, we will simply overwhelm it
with thousands of cheap space mines
or with a better and easily developed
ASAT, ones that can even reach geo-
synchronous orbit.

”Oh yes, we can also wreak havok
with the sate|lite’s internal guidance
and communications. After all, you
need to tell your satellite when to
start firing, but what ifwe jam all the
frequencies used to communicate
with it?

”Face it, Comrade Yankee, satel-
lites are sitting ducks in space[’

American: ”Satel|ites may be in-
effective, but you can't touch our
gro'und-based lasers, an_ti-warhead
missiles and ’pop-up X-ray lasers.’ ”

Soviet: ”We don't need to! Those
defensive systems can never touch

_ our lCBMS, so our nuclear warheads

will be launched and targeted. We
can then do three things to frustrate
your defensive system.

”First, we can harden our war-

heads so your lasers and charged-

particle accelerators cannot damage
their internal electronics. This meas-
ure does not cost much and does not
require any costly and time-
consuming new technology to
develop. ‘

"Second,  can over-saturate:

your syst
b‘—l'

em with dummy warheads.
 ,lmh,gn>"be; ,' ._ . .d,_

         

    

 

Your lasers and anti-warhead missiles
may be able to knock out an amaz-
ing 10,000 warheads, but how easy
it would be for us to launch at least
90,000 plastic dummy warheads
along with the 10,000 real ones.
Therefore your system would only be
10 percent efficient and, in terms of
anuclear strike, that contribution is
insignificant.

”Third, you will spend at least $1.
trillion to develop your system. We
will spend merely billions of rubles
building thousands of new I-CBMS
that launch faster and give you less
warning time, christening new mis-
sile subs that cut warning time down
to three minutes (and can be used to
knock out your SDI control centers)
and developing new warheads that
are harder to destroy. Perhaps we will
even let loose a few terrorists armed
with small nuclear bombs, eh?”

American: ”So, you're saying that
you can overwhelm our SDI system
without new technology at a cost far
less than what we will pay to develop
SDI."

Soviet: ’’I am saying that we can
easily kill the knight before he
mounts his horse.

”You Americans are very good at

 throwing money at problems, and $1

trillion is certainly a large sum.
Perhaps we should Pet you pursue
your president's precious Star Wars
project. To us it will be $1 trillion not
spent on building conventional

‘weapons, educating your youth,

helping your floundering farmers'or
funding positive research in medi-'
ci_ne,\energy, etc.

”In that case, Comrade Yankee,
couldn't we‘ say that the Soviet Un-
ion has finally won the Cold War?”

In this day and age,virginity is still fine

Q. I get tired of seeing gold stars
handed out in your column to girls
who brag about their virginity. Have
you no" compassion for those of us
who have made our mistakes and are
trying to put our lives together? We
need understanding, and we need all
the help we can get in building up
our self-esteem. Civing yourself com-
pletely at a young age and finding
out that he wasn't worth it and was
only using you sexually is hard
enough without being condemned

' on every side.

A. People who get into sex too
young have all my sympathy, and I
have seen again and again how
difficult it is to get outof that pattern
of letting oneself be used in the hope
of finding love and affection and ap-
proval.

I always tell young people to leave
bad early experiences behind and get

on with growing up and having their i

own lives, resisting new pressures.
One mistake, or a few mistakes, need
not mess up a whole life. But grow-
ing up in our society is easier if we
don't get into experiences before we
are ready for them.

We are creatures that mature slow-
ly — mentally, physically, socially,

morally, spiritually. So I always say
”Bravo” when people tell me they
have not gotten into sex because they
don't feel ready for it yet. Not be-
cause being virgins covers them with
gold plate, but because they are right
to resist, to say no, to ignore pressure
and teasing and self-doubts.

The fact is, many young people, .

very young, are made to wonder if
they are sexual freaks because they

_ are virgins. And then they are subject-

ed to a great deal of indecent curi-
osity and jeering because they are
still virgins as they get older, as if they
had no right to steer their own
course. You see, virgins need support
and encouragement, too.

Let me ask you if there was not a
time when you felt a lot of pressure
to get into something that really
frightened you. And haven't you seen
the pressure being put on other peo-
ple around you? I hope that you, with
what you know now, will be suppor-
tive to some friend who is a virgin
and is not ready to jump into _an
unknown that is really not at all in-
viting — not at this moment in life.
With your experience, you can be a
helpful friend to someone a little
younger than you are.

But you certainly don't have to
think of yourself as someone stuck in
the role of being sadder but wiser, al-
ways regretting what is behind you
and spoiling all your good ex-
periences and sunny seasons with
dumb misery about that one sad thing
that happened.

I bet you will agree with me that
it is wrong to rush into being grown
up when you don't know what you
are doing by getting into intense rela-
tionships that disappoint you bitter-

Bad weather brings out t

O’Hare International Airport, on a
day when there has been bad
weather, skews the tempo of life all
over the United States. Bad weather
in Chicago means.that countless con-

necting flights to and from other ci- '

ties [will be delayed and, in some
cases, canceled. Chicagoans may be
annoyed that a thunderstorm makes
getting to work more of a chore; that
thunderstorm, though, has reverber-
ations around the country for Ameri-
ca’s fliers.

I went out to O’Hare on a recent
day when storms had fouled up the

' system. Some observations:

0 The pay telephones are constant-
ly in use. The first words that people
use when they reach the party on the
other end are always the same: ”I’m
still at O’Hare.” Those four words are
spoken in tones usually reserved for
an obscenity; in Chicago, ”O’Hare”
may just be the name of the local air-
port, but around the country, it"is a
synonym for a kind of purgatory.

The people on the pay phones at
O’Hare behave almost defensively.
They explain that they will be late for
a scheduled meeting or a homecom-
ing with the family, and they are
apologetic about it. O’Hare is a force
of nature, and people ac_t__a_ little

sheepish for having been overcome
by that force. ' .

0 Drinking gets out of hand. There
are small bars in virtually all of the
concourses, but the main one is lo-
cated in the rotunda. People who
would never think to have a drink in
the middle of the day give in; when
you've just been told that your flight
is going to beat least four hours late,
going to the bar becomes a reasona-
ble alternative to sitting at the gate.
The men and women in the rotunda
bar seem a bit embarrassed to be
knocking back so many drinks while
the sun is still shining; they glance at
one another with a ”What are you
going fo do?” look in their eyes. They
are not drinking for pleasure; they are
not drinking to get drunk. They are

merely drinking because ofO’Hare. ’

0 The most intense television view-
ers in the world are the people at
O’Hare on a bad-weather day. They
don't watch commercial channels;
they watch the TV monitors that tell
them when the flights are due to ar-
rive and depart. They have it down
to a science —- they figure out what
city the plane they will eventually
board is coming from, and they
check on its progress every few

 

minutes. The departure times on the
board are constantly changing, but
there is one rule that is absolute: the
times never get earlier, they always

‘get pushed back later. The travelers

seem hypnotized by the TV monitors;
some stand there for up to a half hour
at a time, just waiting for the num-
bers to change. '

0 The people who aren't drinking
and whoiaren’t staring at the TV mo-
nitors have mastered an almost Zen-
like art: They settle back for the du-
ration and put themselves in a semi-
trance. They are conscious, yes, but

Iy when you are too young for that.

Even when a person is 40 or 50,
a sad or bad relationship is hard to
take; when you never really wanted
it and were too young to take the
grown-up risks that go with loving,
it is devastating. But with luck and
good sense and some guidance, a hu-
man being gets over it and is restored.
Human beings are resilient.

Not to give myself any gold star, I
do not judge people by whether they
are virgins or not as much as by how
well they are meeting life, learning,
taking charge, achieving and making
life better for themselves and for
others. Among my fellow human be-
ings, I find many who take the same
attitude. We are unjust if we think
everyone is‘ unjust to us.

I believe this, and everywhere you
will find other people who feel the
same way. They will see you at your
true worth and me at mine, and we
can like them right back — and see
ourselves in the best of lights as well.

But all human beings have an ab-
solute right to defend their own feel-
ings, to have privacy and to tell others
to go away if they try to interfere with
that. Especially young and develop-
ing people have the right to set their

own timetables and priorities.
Without being unkind or harmful to

anyone, we can encourage them to ,

defend that right. OK?

Q. My wife and I want a child. I

have ulcerated colitis, and I suspect

that the medicinal take for it is in-"

terfering with our conceiving. Is this
possible? -

A. I am not a medical doctor. I have
no idea. Call the nearest teaching‘

hospital and ask to be put in touch _'

with a fertility clinic.

Q. My wife and I have been mar-
ried 23 years, and I have always
wanted sex morning, noon and night.
Lately she won ’t permit it more than
every 30-90 days. I get sick of being
cut off like that. I'm forced to the

usual alternatives, which have not in- ‘

cluded other women yet. What can

be done? Twenty-three years is a long

association.

A. How nice are you to her? As
nice as when you knew her 23 years
ago? What if you were to woo her,
spend time with her, take her out,
stay in with her and make her feel
loved? That's always worth trying be-
fore you call up a sex therapist.

e best in people

they are in that zone between alert-
ness and dozing. They do this pur-
posely; they seem to have figured that

if you were to spend all day at

O’Hare with all your resources func-
tioning at a normal level, you would
go crazy. So they pick a chair, and
they lean back, and the trance begins.
They shut out all sights and sounds
but somehow activate a mechanism
in their brains that will cause them
to stir at a mention on the public ad-
dress system of their flight number.
Someone should make a science fic-
tion movie about these people.

0 For the people who choose not to
go into a trance, there is a kind of
camaraderie that develops at O’Hare

_ on a bad-weather day that you sel-

dom see in our cold and distant
society. .

People actually talk to strangers.
On a downtown street or on a bus,
they might never do such a thing; but
O’Hare seems to bring out the hu-
manity in some people. The common
opening is, ”How long have you
been waiting?” And then a real con-
versation starts.

These are seldom interactions that
are destined to result in anything.
Much of the time no names are even
exchanged, and you get the impres-

sion that the people will never see
each other again. But it is as if every-
one realizes that they have been
snatched from the real world — the

world of their homes and offices and r

families — and have been plopped
down in this weird netherworld -
O’Hare. So, like lost adventurers on
some dark and dismal journey, they
seek each other out. Soon they will
return to the America they know.
0 There's one rule of thumb I have
always believed in: If you _are at
O’Hare on a bad-weather day, you
will run into someone you know. It
never seems to fail. O’Hare on a bad-
weather day is the epicenter of the
universe, and somehow you will
cross paths with an old acquaintance.
On this particular day, though, I

was beginning to doubt myself. I had _

been at O’Hare for a goodly amount
of time and had spoken to no one
whom I had met before. I thought the
old adage was about to be proven
false.

But then I heard a voice:

”Bob?”

I turned around.

It was the man who had lived in the ~

house two doors down from me
when I was a kid growing up.
That's O’Hare for you.

”Imagine what would happen

centuries, can finally take no more
and rebel,” James Ellsworth asks
us. Imagine? Why, we've already
seen it. In 1776, a group of Brit-
ish citizens, tired of being op-
pressed by a monarchy, chose to
create their_own government ”of
the people, by the people and for
the people.” And look at the
chain of events that catalyzed.
Eventually women demanded the
right to vote for the people mak-
ing political decisions on their be-
half. They demanded to be

merely possessions of men. Black
slaves demanded the right to con-
trol their own bodies and minds.
Then they wanted voting rights.
And eventually, blacks and wom-
en demanded the right to receive
equal pay when performing the
same jobs as white men and equal
-consideration for the same jobs.
What happened when a people,
oppressed for centuries, could fi-
nally take no more and rebelled?
An authoritarian white male re-

when a people, oppressed for '

recognized as individua_ls, not"

gime was dismantled. Bishop Tutu
does not want white people to be
denied the rights they deserve.
Neither does Nelson Mandela.
Neither do most black South Afri-
cans. They want people ‘of all
colors to be treated equally —
they want justice, not revenge.
What motivation does an
American company have to pull
out of South Africa? Moral obliga-
tion? No. Loss of profits. Over-
whelming public opposition to
South African investments cou-
' pled with massive divestment
from companies doing business
there makes pulling out of_ South
Africa a wise business move.
What will happen if the interna-
tional community does not
respond to the pleas of‘ Tutu,
Mandela and numerous other
black South African leaders to
divest? A revolution will surely oc-
cur, and a booming economy will
fuel the government's armies.
What will happen if we do
respond to the blacks’ cries for
help? The South African economy
will weaken with one of two

LETTERS

results. Either the whites will
make reforms to avoid economic
ruin or, more probably, a revolu-
tion will occur anyway. In this cir-
cumstance, however, the white
government will not have as
much revenue to continue to pay
armies and to buy weapons. This
will give the blacks a much great-
er edge. It is generally agreed
upon, even by opponents of
divestment, like James Ellsworth,
that the blacks will indeed win the
revolution, and if the whites have
a weakened ‘defense, the blacks
will win sooner. Which means
fewer lives will be lost, and a fair
government can be created soon-
er.
Divestment isn't the only op-
tion, as G.B. Patterson and James
. Ellsworth pointed out, but it is the
most sensible one. The purpose of
divesting from U.S. companies
operating in South Africa is to
make pulling out of that country

Divestment is the best alternative available

financially beneficial for those
companies.

Pitt's policy of selective divest-
ment does not acheive that goal.
It ensures that the companies we
support treat blacks fairly in the
workplace, but black South Afri-
cans can still be detained, tortured
and even killed for any reason.

Understand, Wesley Posvar,
that we do not charge you with
genocide. And G.B. Patterson, we
do not charge you with racism.
We charge you both with naivety.

Benedum security

Studying at night in Benedum
Hall has the potential to cause a
serious injury —— not from over-

. working the [gray] matter, but
from being locked in the building.
I bring this to everyone’s attention
because of theserious nature of
the hazard waiting for an ac-
Cident.

Late yesterday evening, [Nov.
4], I tried to gain access into Bene-

dum Hall, only to find all of the
outer doors were locked. Typical-
ly, a call to the campus police sta-
tion to ask for the doors to be
opened is routine. However, be-
tween 11 and 11:30 p.m. there is
a shift change at [campus police] 4
HQ, and apparently, these doors
cannot be opened until the ser-
geant returns from his/her rounds.
I called twice within the space of
15 minutes to enter Benedum.
Although this was inconvenient,
I realized the need for security.
However, consider the following
situations: A student is studying
with some friends, and one of
them becomes very ill and needs
medical attention. The doors to
Benedum could not be opened.
What would happen to the stu-
dent? Also consider what would _ .
happen if there were an explosion
in a lab that did not activate any
alarms. Would the paramedics be
able to get into the building at this
time, or would we have to wait for
the coroner?

Survey says more people coming back to college

Editor's Note — This is the last in
a series of three articles produced for
The Associated Press by the Pennsyl-
vania Association of Colleges and
Universities in observance of Higher

- Education Week.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — As Pennsyl-

'vania’s economy changes, so too

does the‘ nature of higher education.
A survey of colleges and universities
shows a major increase in the num-
ber of continuing education students:
mostly those out of work and those
looking to change their careers.

Many of these adults never attend-
ed college before. Others are seek-
ing academic degrees in a second
field. As might be expected, business
and computer courses are very popu-
lar. But education, law enforcement
and social services are also on the
upswing. 0

Indiana University of Pennsylvania
is bolstering its continuing education
programs, offering regular college
courses as well as special training.

Th rough evening and weekend class-
es, teleconferences and television
courses, IUP is adapting to the par- '
ticular educational needs of south-
western Pennsylvania.

”Learning on the run,” said Nicho-
las Kolb, dean of the School of Con-
tinuing Education, ”is for many the
only way to keep up with changing
times. With both older adults and
traditional 18- to 22-year-olds, we're
seeing more and more part-time stu-
dents.” It is because of economic cir-
cumstances that ”they tend to get in
and get out as best they can.

”For many years the steel industry
flourished here,” Kolb continued.
”But with the collapse of steel, many
workers have difficulty adapting their
background and skills to other
careers.”

IUP now offers complete evening
degree programs in business, com-
puter science and education. ”With‘
the forecast of a future dearth of
teachers, education is once again
proving very popular here,” Kolb

Those unable to regularly attend
classes can take television-assisted
courses, according to Kolb. Students
are required to view public television
programs and read supplemental
materials.

IUP also offers non—credit training
for non-traditional students. Training
for careers in criminal justice has
proven extremely successful. Kolb
explained: Many unemployed coal
miners are not interested in com-
puters or business. But they are well
suited for law enforcement, either as
police officers or security guards.

On occas_ion, IUP also conducts
seminars by teleconference. The
university is also establishing partner-
ships with local companies that must
provide training and re-training for
employees. ”Things change so fast,”
Kolb said, ”that the need for educa-
tion never ends.”

has dramatically cut employment,

bers of unemployed people and
others who expect to be laid off soon.

”People are looking for a career

public relations director.

"It's like day and night here,” Clark
continued. ”During the day, tradi-
tional college students attend class-
es. But after 5 p.m., the complexion
of the college suddenly changes.”
Day students are then in the dorms
or the library, and classes are filled
with 30- to 45-year-old students,
many of whom work during the day.
Full-fledged degree and non-degree
‘programs also continue through the
summer.

Numbers of continuing education
students have dramatically increased

Lincoln University, a traditional
|iberal_arts college for black students,
does not have a continuing education
program. But it is enrolling more and
_more non-traditional students of both
sexes,—according to public relations
director Sam Pressley. Many of these
students are attracted to Lincoln's

‘ highly regarded undergraduate and

master's programs in human services.

The master's program — the only
one offered at Lincoln —— will accept
some students who have not earned
an undergraduate degree, Pressley
said. Previous work experience can
be treated as a B.A. equivalency. The
master's program, which takes two or
three years to complete, was initiat-
ed in 1977 and has enjoyed outstand-
ing success. Held on Saturdays, these
classes attract some 200 students
from the tri-state area — Pennsylva-
nia, New Jersey and New York.

The musical Grease is a show
that takes the audience back to
the fun and carefree '50s. Unfor-
tunately, the production by the
University of Pittsburgh Theater
never quite makes it back. The
new labels on the Rolling Rock
beer battles, the stirrups on San-
dy's final costume and most im-
portantly the movements of the

. cast during the dances don't al-

low the audience to become
completely immersed in the '50s
attitude.

The cast is energetic and ex-
citing for the opening number, a
parody of the school alma
mater. Throughout the show, the
songs done by the entire cast
area pleasure to watch. But, for
an entire cast, the total volume

. . of the songs are not very loud,

and I wonder if those sitting in
the back of the theater were
able to hear without straining.
The second number is ”Sum-
mer Nights." This is Sandy's
opening song, an important
device in defining her character.
Donna Harfenist grabs the

microphone and appears to be
more a rock star than an actress
in a musical. She plays the part
aggressively and never really
seems to be an outsider who
wants to be part of a group.
When comparing ”Summer
Nights" to ”All Choked Up,”
you'll find there isn't a great
change of style, iust a change of

' costume. James Bond (Danny

Zuko) doesn't let the micro-
phone detract from his perfor-
mance during this song. But
throughout the show, the use of
the microphone was occasional-
ly distracting.

Perhaps the most entertaining
scene was when the Pink Ladies
and Burger Palace Boys were
frolicking in the park. The most
well done number was ”i\/loon-
ing” by Ken-Nelson Suggs
(Roger). Not only was the actu-
al singingwell done but Camille
J. Hallstrom complemented his
performance perfectly with her
facial expressions without being
distracting. Hallstrom and Suggs
do a sort of give and take that

is perfectly timed and highly en-
tertaining.

Nora Gerard (Betty Rizzo)
gives a good rendition of ”Look
at Me, l’m Sandra Dee.” She
has an extremely powerful voice
and consistently displays the
anger present in Rizzo. Gerard
is the worst offender of including
modern movement in the '50s-
style dancing. At times she
would have been better off
dancing at the R.E.l\/l. concert.

”Alone at the Drive-ln Movie”
is Bond's best number. He be-
gins the song after Sandy leaves
him. The song is nicely set up by
the preceding scene, because
the interaction between the two

performers is hilarious, and the
audience response on Saturday
night was inspiring. Bond plays
the audience well and shows his
vocal range during this song.

As a whole, the characteriza-
tion of the males was much bet-
ter than those of the females.
Edward McEneaney was con-
vincing as the tough Kenickie.
The portrayal of Sonny LaTierri
by Paul B. Feirstein is funny when
he tries to appear tough in front
of the guys. Feirstein has a good
sense of timing, especially when
he tries to make a stand against
Lynch. The girls, on the other

hand, were very much alike. 4

Gerard was the only one whose

personality and style seemed
unique. .

The University of Pittsburgh
Theater's production was disap-
pointing but not intolerable. The
use of the microphone, styles of
dancing and contemporary
props and costume can be over-
looked. If you are willing to ac-
cept Donna Harfenist's portrayal
of Sandy as somewhat un-
changing and to concentrate on
the pure entertainment aspect of
the show (the music and funny
bits), then Grease is a good
show. If you want to see an ac-
curate picture of life in the '50s,
stay home and look through a
photo album. ’

THE BANGLES
Syria Mosque
Oct. 29, 1986

By Maria Ritz and
Jill Matenkosky

CMU’s victory in MTV’s ”Bust
Multiple Sclerosis" contest in
May brought The Bangles to the
Syria Mosque on Oct. 29..The

female quartet created quite a
stir in their benefit performance,
but perhaps the greater hit of the
night was an airband rendition
of Morris Day and The Time's
”The*Bird."

Seven CMU "musicians"
brought down the house as they
re—enacted another MTV contest

winning performance, last fall's
airband competition number.

mended CMU’s efforts in fund-
raising to fight M.S. and in-
troduced The Bangles, saying,”l
can't think of a better place to
walk like an Egyptian than the
Syria Mosque." '
The crowd rushed to the aisles
as the four women took the
stage. The Bangles’ leader, Vicki
Peterson, shared vocals with her
drummer/sister Debbie, guitarist
Susanah Hoffs and bassist

A letter:

Dear Editor:

In a recent visit to Pitt, I
came across The Pitt News,
and I could. not believe the
shallow, one-sided review‘
written by Ike Shibley on Bon
Jovi's S/ippery When Wet al-
bum. Apparently he has
tastes that belong. to the
minority, considering S/ippery
When Wet is the No.
I-selling album according to
Billboard, [and] ”You Give
.Love a Bad Name" [has
been] the No. I request on
MTV’s Top 20 Video Count-
down, Top 8 at 8 on B94,
Top 5 at 5 of WDVE [and]
Top /0 ofQ/02 consistently

MTV VJ Mark Goodman com-

Defending the Bon Jovi name

for approximately the past
two months.

_ Mr. Shibley claims that the
lyrics are, ”a myriad of other
compositions." Well, now,
how many songs can you
name that don't come near to
the love/relationship theme?
Bon Jovi presents this theme
in a spicy, lively way. lke
should’ve delved deeper to
find the true, from-the—heart,
easy—to-relate—to meanings of
the songs such as ”Wanted
Dead or Alive,” which tells of
the loneliness of the constant
touring_that he (Jon) relates to
being a modern day
cowboy.

- As for Ike Shibley’s com-

ment that Bon Jovi is a chau-
vanistic band, all I can say is
that may be the way he sees
it. Others see it as provoca-
tive and sexy. Why fight it?
It seems to add to the band's
appeal and attraction of mil-
lions of fans.

I'd like to end by saying
that Ike Shibley is entitled to
his opinions, iust as I am to
mine. But I think the criticisms
made of Bon Jovi can apply
to all the rock bands today,
and their success is saying
enough on their own defense.

Sincerely,
Cheryl Viazanko

”We’re here tonight to
celebrate life and the fight
against M.S.l”

After a selection of lesser-
known songs, The Bangles
brought everyone to their feet
with the familiar "If She Knew
What She Wants." Surprising-
ly, the bulk of the music-was not
as mellow as their popular tunes,
but more hard-driving- with
heavy guitar work. The sound
quality was comparable to that
of their studio output. ,

Anyone doubting the musical
abilities of this group can rest as-
sured that The Bangles have
mastered their instruments and
are not simply a case of girl
group nostalgia.

The set featured the bulk of the
material from the'band’s two al-
bums, with the true crowd-
pleasers being ”When the Hero

Takes a Fall,” ”Manic Mon-
day" and the current chart-
climber, ”Walk Like an
Egyptian." "

Buftenf/ies Are Free, currently

. running at the Tonidale Dinner

Theater in Robinson Township, is
a middle-brow soap opera
comedy/drama that elicits its fair
share of both hearty guffaws
and tear-ierking sighs. Definite-
ty a ’60—ish period piece, the

play is set in a low-budget

apartment on New York's low-

‘ er East Side and takes place in

the course of only one day — a
day in the life of Don Baker, the
drama's main protagonist. Don,
a youthful, aspiring musician,
played by T.C. Brown, has re-
cently moved into his rather
austere dwelling — partly to es-
cape from his overprotective,

domineering mother and partly

to work on his career as a
guitarist and songwriter. He
soon makes the acquaintance of

‘ his next door neighbor, a come-

ly, scatterbrained flower child

-named Jill Tanner. With such

lines as I wanted to go to UCLA,

cover that her neighbor Don is
blind, largely due to the ease
and facility with which he moves
about his apartment. And
whether moved by pity or by a
kinky, quirky attraction, she soon
recovers from her initial shock of
finding out that Don is sightless,
yields to her youthful impulses
and winds up in 'the«sack with
him.

Later, lounging around in their
underwear, the newly paired
lovers are quite unexpectedly
and abruptly visited by Do'n’s
mother, an aggressive, over-
solicitous matron from Scarsdale
who is played by Claire Rat-
way. After arriving at a quick
appraisal of what has iust oc-
curred, she lets Don know in no
uncertain terms what she thinks
of his behavior. Toward even-

chura, is her new lover. Left
alone with only his mother, Don
‘comes to grips with his iilted love
affair and proceeds to fall apart
emotionally.’

We can sympathize with
Don's blindness, his romantic
breakup and his struggle to
break away from maternal de-
pendence, but we're left without
even an inkling of the sorrow,
fear and guilt Mrs. Baker must
have felt for her sightless son.

T.C. Brown, as Don Baker,
fared well in the play, eliciting
both our sympathy and affec-
tion. His scenes with Jill 'were es-
pecially warm and compelling,
and the two of them garnered
many a chuckle from the au-
dience. His emotional collapse
after being shafted by Jill,
however, was much too strident
and vociferous, especially in
light of the fact that he knew his

mistress for only a few hours. .

Then too, Jill's fluctuating and in-
consistent feelings for Don that
changed from affection and
seduction to reversal and retreat
and then back again to commit-
ment were too abrupt, too un-

cations department was bad,"
he explained.

We asked him to elaborate on
a statement he made before in-
troducing The Bangles that
went: "l got wild and crazy on
the Cathedral Lawn when l lived
here." Goodman laughed,
"That was too much; a long time
ago," but wouldn't disclose fur-
ther details.

Though Goodman plugs all
types of music — both new and
old —- on MTV, he prefers the
current releases of ’Til Tuesday,
Billy ldol, David Lee Roth.and
The Bangles.

’’If one guest ever really im-
pressed and amused me-[in] an
interview on MTV, it would have
to be David Lee Roth," Good-
man noted. "He's incredibly en-
tertaining, intelligent and far
more well—read than people are
led to believe. He's not strictly
the party animal you'd think.
He's thoughtful andliterate."

Before we had time to query
him any further, an MTV co-
worker delivered Goodman a

‘letter from an admirer and

whisked him backstage to visit
with The Bangles. He conclud-
ed his Pittsburgh visit by return-
ing to his old apartment building

The newEIvis

Compassio

By Mary Campbell
AP writer

NEW YORK (AP) — Elvis
Costello, considered the most
talented songwriter to emerge
trom English new-wave rock,
has released two records this
year with songs heiconsiders to
be more compassionate than
usual.

King of/America, released last
spring, was co-produced with T-
Bone Burnett and used country
studio musicians.

"It's a more open record,
more clear Iyricallyand more
generous in emotion,” Costello
said in an interview. "There are

, not so many mean songs on it.

Some of m most successful

y 3
songs have been quite
maIevoIent."

Blood and Chocolate, Costel-

' lo’s I3th LP in the United States,

uses his long-time band, the‘At—

E tractions.

"I very much want the new
record to be successful because
I've had tew commercial suc-
cesses," he said. "Over the last
couple of years, I haven't been
doing songs of great emotional
substance. People's teelings

have been strong tor more vivid
material that came earlier in my
career. I haven't gone to the
hearts at people. The ones they
get excited about are the old
songs, still."

_The Columbia record was No.
74 with a bullet on the Oct. 25
best-selling chart and has been
applauded by musicvcritics.

An aura ot mystery and un-
availability has surrounded
Costello through much ot his
career.

"It was tor avoiding having to
do interviews," he said. "They
had written the article before
they came to you. There was
very little point in saying any-

. thing. It was easier to toster be-

ing ditticult or mysterious or
violent or all three, so people
stayed away from you. I was
working at a very turious pace.
Let them write the stupid non-
sense they were going to write
anyway. All I wanted to do was
get on with the work." '
Costello lives in London. He
put his real name, Declan
McManus, on King of/America.
"I'm 32. I was 22 when I start-
ed. It's a way of saying that a
period at time has elapsed, and
that's my name. You're not to

n is in fasion

take my name changing too seri-
ously. There's no psychoanalyt-
ical reasoning behind it."

About changing Declan
McManus to Elvis Costello, he
said, "McManus was hard to
say over the phone, the N and
M. And teachers had great
ditticulty pronouncing Declan.
My great-grandfather's name
was Costello. My manager
added Elvis, like a stunt, a life-
Iong stunt. v

"There was a sense of 'How
dare you appropriate that
name?' There was an attraction
in that." ‘

Costello. has recently been
producing for the Irish band The
Pogues. "I'm not technically
minded as a producer. I'm more
like a musical director. I grab
something with imaginative feel-
ing and strong emotional content
and capture it. I can describe
what I want to hear.

"T-Bone Burnettworked that
way with me. He told me not to
lose my nerve it I tailed to get
one version down. He told me
not to tinker with it. Remember
why I wrote it instead at getting

. anxious and trying to change

it"

Gotta Have It.

By Douglas Payne

Nola Darling is a successful
woman — a female icon of pul-
sating sensuality with a satisfy-
ing and rewarding career. Her
sharp mind and creative intellect
balance out her deepest pas-
sions and greatest desires. Nola
is a woman who knows exactly
what she wants, exactly how to
get it and exactly how to keep
it. She's fresh. The problem is
that nobody else seems to know
what Nola wants. Everybody
thinks ‘Nola’s a freak except
Nola. The three lovers in her life
can't figure out what's going on
or why, because they all in-
dividually consider themselves to

be the ”right man" for Nola —- ~

each believing himself to be the
answer to the question mark
they place at the end of Nola’s
lifestyle. They don't understand

Spie Le is the wrier, director and editor of Se’s

    

that Nola’s not confused. Her
mind is made up. She needs all
three of them.

This "love quadrangle” is
what makes up She’s Gotta
Have It, a new American film
written and directed by 29-year—
old Spike Lee, which is showing
at Pittsburgh Filmmakers at the
Fulton Theater downtown until
November 25. This very funny
comedy of manners, which fea-
tures an all—b|ack cast, is a twist
on Annie Hall and sports some
very clever dialogue among an
obscure group of talent. Stylish-
ly filmed in black and white,

- Lee's first film is a very beautiful

work of art with enough smarts
to be sexy, sassy and tender at
the same time.

Nola (played by the radiant-
ly beautiful Tracy Camila Johns,
who resembles a young Gladys
Knight) takes on a vibrant per-
sonalityall her own. Her expres-

Spike’s Rap

sive sexuality and commanding
personality endears her passion-
ately to the men in her life. Each
man knows about the other two
men in Nola’s heart, but they all
realize (in their spurts of
iealousy) that this woman is
worth holding onto. Jamie Over-
street (Redmond Hicks) is the in-
tellectual passion in Nola’s life.
His honest-yet—sappy poetry
strikes a very warm chord in No-
la’s heart. His amorous thought-
fulness provokes a very beautiful
scene in She's Gotta Have It
where a colorful Oz sequence
celebrates her birthday.
However, Jamie is not enough
for Nola.

Greer Childs (John Canada
Terrell) is the muscle man with an
appreciation for the finer things
in life, namely himself and wom-
en. Nola frequents nice restaur-
ants with Greer and finds her
greatest physical desires in him.
Their frolicking is hot and fierce,
but Nola is forced to wait while
Greer takes off his clothes and
folds each individual garment
with perfectionist precision.

Mars (played by Spike Lee),
the streetwise dude, is the comic
relief in Nola’s life. He makes
love to Nola with his hightops
on and pleads to see her by rap-
ping, "Please baby, please,
baby please, baby, baby, baby
please.” lvlars is a trip, -but he

truly loves Nola. Lee's perfor-
mance, though, is the most
memorable in the film. His comic
gifts have ‘the street sense of
Doug E. Fresh and the coarse
timing of Eddie Murphy. His
grace is flawless in its absence
and-his finesse is perfect.

Lee has directed a minor sen-
sation in She's Gotta Have /t. lt’s
a hard film to dislike. The accom-
panying iazz score (written by
Spike's father, bassist Bill Lee) is
a perfect and natural compli-
ment to the passion with which
this film was made. The warmth
is shared with the viewer, and
the jazzy score transcends the
feelings with an admirable
charm. With the possible excep-
tion of some love scenes, his sto-
ry never strays from the
emotional crisis facing all the
confounded souls in Nola’s life.
The passions are emotional and
never meant to be pornograph-
ic. It's very much a woman's pic-
ture with great attention and
care given to a feminine pointof
view that never seeks to stereo-
type or moralize. Lee, still very
much a novice with only three
film shorts to his credit, has con-
structed a very artful film with
enough feeling, warmth and joy
to sustain this considerably suc-
cessful effort. '

There does, however, seem to
be a great lack of purpose to

 

She's Gotta Have /t.

We are told at the beginning
that this will be Nola’s justifica-
tion for why she is the way she
is. Since others in her life have
had such little success in figuring
her out, Nola herself addresses
the screen in the hope that we
will understand what ”makes
Nola tick.” After a somewhat
less than satisfactory, although
predictable, resolution, we
leave the theater having a
greater understanding of Nola
and a tad bit of respect for her,
but is that enough? She's Gotta
Have It portrays a character
whose individuality spars with
her common sense rather than a
human being who envelops
womanhood in the '80s with
sense and sensuality. Nola does

this, but in a fashion that might \

seem foreign to many in a con-
servative era of ”safe sex."
One leaves this movie asking
what the significance of such an
experience is. Perhaps Nola is a
crusader of feminine indepen-
dence, playing in a man's
world, playing by a man's rules.
lf so, she is an emotional heroine
in a role unlike anything any ac-
tress has performed in the '80s.
lf not, She's Gotta Have It, like
its director, is a smart, yet witty
comedy on what it means to be
young, gifted and black in the
'80s. ' .

Peggy Sue

A marriage of missed chanoesand the tricks of memory

  By Bob Thomas

AP Writer

If there's anything Hollywood
likes better than seeing a giant
fall, it's seeing one restored to
greatness. That's why there is
general elation over the return to
glory of Francis Coppola with
Peggy Sue Got /\/larried.

Coppola astounded the film

world with The Godfather, then I

broke all the rules by making a

sequel that was even better. But.

he seemed to be falling into ex-

and he was roundly booed for

Coppola reveals an unexpected
soft side of his nature. Adroitly
written by Jerry Leichtling and
Arlene Sarner, it is a bittersweet
tale of memory and remorse.
Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner),

newly separated from her TV.

pitchman huband (Nicholas
Cage), is reluctant to attend her
25th high school reunion. Her
teen—age daughter (Helen Hunt)
persuades her to do so.

To her surprise, she is chosen
queen of the affair, and Richard
Norvik (Barry Miller), the one-

time bookworm who is now a

multimillionaire in microchips, is

king.

The excitement of it all — and
seeing her estranged husband —
is too much for Peggy Sue. She
collapses and regresses into her
world of 25 years ago. But she

Kathleen Turner leaves no doubt

his attempts to carve a career as

- WHIPLAH SILE
Billy Idol

Chrysalis
By John .Mccombe

-I used to really despise Billy
Idol until l read a recent Spin
magazine interview with him.
He said something to the effect
that critics were never complete-
ly wrong in their appraisals of
the icons of rock ’n’ roll. ldol be-

- lieves that there has always

been at least a kernel of truth in
the negative press he has re-

ceived.

There must be a human being
lurking somewhere beneath the
sneer, I concluded. Or maybe
his words only made me feel
better about my iob as a "critic
of popular music." When l
flaunt a title like that, l realize
that l'm being more than a little
pompous. Billy ldol seems to
have realized that his video im-
age, with his curled lip and
clenched fist,‘ is pompous as
well. He's settled into a role as
a highly competent musician.
More than two years were spent
on the production of Whip/ash
Smile, and his effort definitely
shows.

The new album is a triumph of
his ability to exploit his strengths
and mask his weaknesses. Since
he has nothing of great im or-
tance to say, there is no yric
sheet and his vocals are buried
beneath a wall of Steve Stevens"
guitars." His strength, on the
other hand, is the way in which
he layers Stevens’ guitars over
his seductive growling.

The first single, "To Be a
Lover," is an exception to the
rule on Whiplash Smile. The
steady pulse of clockwork key-
boards and the soulful wailing of
the backing vocalists add to the
sense of tension and unfulfilled
release that dominates ”Lover.”
Much more ldolesque is
"World's Forgotten Boy." The
unrelenting wash of power
chording whacks you over the
head from the opening bars and
never relents. lt's a typical full-

.frontal assault from ldol, a tech-

nique which he has mastered
with this record.

Similarly aggressive are "Soul
Standing By" and ”Don’t Need
a Gun," which would be a log-
ical choice for the next single
release. However, Whip/ash
Smile does include some relief
from the snarling and thrashing.
”Sweet Sixteen” is a country
flavored offering that finds ldol
dropping his bad—ass pose with
an unlikely display of com-

passion.

With Whip/ash Smile, Billy
ldol has matured, especially in
the songwriting department.
Still, he's held on to the some-
what ridiculous stance of the
golden—haired rock ’n' roll rebel.
Very few would be qualified to
hold his positionof adolescent
fantasy boy/guitar rock hero. It's
a tough job, but somebody’s
gotta do it. And Billy ldol does
it pretty well.

HIGH OCTANE REVIVAL
Scruffy the Cat
Relativity

, CRACKED MARBLES

The Reactions
Homestead Records

By John Young
For the talented, original band

playing music on roc ’s cutting
edge, the process of getting
heard outside of your home
town can be a difficult and frus-
trating one. Record-making has
long been acclaimed as the best
way to make your music known,
but studio time and album-
pressing prove too pricey for
most young artists on a budget.
Thusly came about the six-song
EP;. less expensive than an LP to
record, it has become an effec-
tive medium for independent
labels to show off their hot, new
acts. .

Scruffy The Cat delivers a
smooth ride and peak perform-
ance capability on their six-song

record High Octane Revival.

The EP opens with the driving

‘ "40 Days & 40 Nights" which

moves to Randall Lee Gibson's
irresistible snare beat and builds
with Stephen Fredette's country
guitar work. Highlights over the
rest of the musical iourney in-
clude the catchy, harmony-
laden, pop—in-overdrive kicker
”Life ls Fun" and ”Buy A Car”
with its heavy guitar 'n' thump
panache. Scruffy The Cat fills
High Octane Revival with ener-
getic, rockin' party music for the
unapologetically intense.

The Reactions turn in a sli_ght—
ly more serious-minded six-song

EP entitled Cracked /vlarb/es.

The band's songs exhibit sheer

power with their big, ringing gui-
tar sound and urgent, sometimes
straining vocals. The record's ti-
tle song is an engaging, memo-
rable call to ”c’mon” from lead
singer Chuck Wagner, and
”Flowers And Tears" builds
from an acoustic opening pas-
sage to a dramatic conclusion.

”l Want You," which first ap— ‘

peared as a single some time
ago, dynamically swells from
iangly, pop verses into tense,
wailing choruses.

Both Scruffy The Cat and The
Reactions prove to be vital-
sounding, tight, sophisticated
bands on their new records.
Perhaps their two releases
demonstrate what the six-song
EP best accomplishes; both
records left me wanting to hear
more from these outstanding mu-
sical outfits.

Fans: be true toyour school  

So the Miami Hurricanes will be in
town tomorrow afternoon to take on
the Pitt Panthers in a nationally tele-
vised game.

The game appears to be a "match-
up between two teams going in op-
posite directions. And it is.

The No. 1-ranked Hurricanes enter
the game with a perfect 8-0 record in-
cluding an impressive 28-15 win over
the Oklahoma Sooners.

Miami is led by all-everything quar-
terback Vinny Testaverde who is a
sure bet to win this year's Heisman
Trophy.

But this team is no one-man show.
The ’Canes have future NFL players
in running backs Alonzo Highsmith
and Melvin Bratton, wide receiver
Mike Irvin and defensive lineman Je-
rome Brown -— not to mention a few
other players as well.

I could rattle on all day about how
talented the Miami team is, but it
would only be reiterating what every-
one already knows: They have the
finest assemblage of talent in the
country, and they have proved it—ev-
ery Saturday afternoon this_fal|.

On the other hand, the Pitt Pan-
thers are struggling. After winning
three of their last four games to im-
prove their record to 4-2-1, the Pan-
thers took to the road last Saturday
to take on the Syracuse Orangemen
in the Carrier Dome.

This was not to be Pitt's day,
though, as the Panthers bowed 24-20
and the team's best and most valua-
ble player, quarterback John Conge-
mi, was lost for the year because of

a back injury.

Panther coach Mike Gottfried has
had to switch people around to differ-
ent positions all year long to make up
for the Panthers’ lack of depth at key
positions such as wide receiver, tight
end and running back.

Now, it is too |ate.in the season to
make any more personnel adjust-

ments. Pitt has only one option left
— to gut it out and make do with the
healthy people they have available.

This is no time for the fans and/or
players to give up.

Yes, the loss of Congemi was a
devastating blow to the team, not
only because of his ability to excel
at his position, but, even more so, be-
cause of his great attitude and leader-
ship abilities. '

Congemi, if his college playing
career is indeed over, as it appears,
_was-a winner. .

But now it is time for someone else
to step to the front and assume that
critical role of team leader.

Pitt has had a great football tradi-
tion through the years, and despite
the disappointment of 1984 and
1985, it is a program that still receives
great respect.

No doubt, Miami is a much better
team than the Panthers. Tomorrow af-
ternoon, though, Pitt has to show
some pride and prove to Miami that
it is a team worthy of respect.

Sure, the Panthers aren't going to
go to a postseason bowl game this
year, and that is a disappointment.
Our bowl game will instead be

played against the Hurricanes at'Pitt
Stadium.

I'm personally challenging the Pitt
fans, if you want to call them that, to
really show some pride in the Pan-
ther football team at the game.

I'm not asking for anything drastic.
I shouldn't be that critical because I
myself was not the most vocal Pitt
supporter when I used to sit in the
stands at last year's games.

But this is a new season. The Pan-
ther football team has a new look.
Sure, our record is a dismal 4-3-1, but
there is a fine line between a good
team and a mediocre team.

Unfortunately, Pitt is on the medi-
ocre side of that line right now. Hind-
sight is always 20-20, but Pitt has lost
and tied its four games by only a to-
tal of 13 points. The situation could
easily be reversed, and the Panthers
could be a respectable 6-2 or 7-1.

At least the team shows more pi-
zazz this year. The days of Fazio’s
conservative offense are over. Gott-
fried loves to fill the airways, and the
offense is fun to watch. And hey, we
even have a good field-goal kicker
this year. '

The bottom line is that, things aren't
looking that ‘bad for the Pitt football
program. Gottfried has shown the
offense how to put the ball in the
endzone. Now he just has to get
some more — okay, many more —
quality players.

This is a very important game for
the Panthers. Nobody is expecting a
Panther victory, and this writer isn't
asking for one. .

But I am hoping that the playe
will play the best 60 minutes of their
lives and come off the football field
being proud to be Pitt Panther foot-
ball players. '

Hopefully, the fans will give their
utmost support to the team and prove
themselves true Pitt Panther football
fans. '

Steve Apke, his career at Pitt enter-
ing its homestretch, would like noth-
ing better than to beat the No. 1 team V
in the nation. But to actually do it will
mean the Panthers will have to do
something nobody else has yet been
able to accomplish — beat the Miami
Hurricanes. . ’

To beat Miami, a defense must first
stop Hurricane quarterback and
shoo-in for the Heisman Trophy, Vin-
ny Testaverde. Then that defense
must contain running backs Alonzo
Highsmith and Melvin Bratton. The
Pitt defense has been ‘playing well
lately, but Apke knows his unit has
its work cut out . for itself this
Saturday.

Osborn a

By Christopher Sepesy

~ Assistant Sports Editor

With all this hoopla about who is
going to be quarterback in tomor-
row’s game, one person seems to be
all but forgotten except by his loyal
fans.

What about Billy Osborn?

Osborn was brought in by_ former

”If you look at playing the No. 1
team as a challenge, then it will be
a plus for you," said Apke. The senior
linebacker went on to say Pitt could

_ be in trouble if it gets caught up in

the Hurricanes’ mighty reputation
and becomes intimidated at playing
the best. ‘

One major problem the Pitt
defense faces this week, besides the
Miami attack, is its own injuries.
Mike Gottfried will be forced to play
a lot of defensive players with limit-
ed experience against the best offense
in America. That does not bother
Apke.

”lt’s exciting,” Apke said. ”lt’s‘a
challenge for them to come in and
play."

One implication of the new faces
is that Apke’s role as a defensive lead-

11

A win would cap Apke’s career

er will be emphasized even more.
”Steve’s a leader,” Gottfried said.
II I '

He 5 a senior, and he knows what
to expect."

What Pitt expects is that Miami will
come at them from all sides.

”They’re going to try to run first,”
Apke said. ”So we have to be ready
for that. As a linebacker, I have to
look for the run first, anyway.”

One thing Apke does not expect is
Pitt to get away from the things they
have been doing thus far this season.
He does not expect the coaching staff
to come up with a lot of strange
defensive alignments in an effort to
confuse Testaverde. '

”|t’ll be a very basic defense that I
we use,” he said. ”We just have to‘

go out and execute well.”

coach Foge Fazio as a quarterback,
but due to an injury to his wrist, he
was moved to defensive back posi-
tion. He amassed great recognition in
this position before new head coach
Mike Gottfried put him into a
receiver's spot.

In this position, especially during
the spring ball season, he was a
standout. By doing exceptionally well

in scrimmages and practices in gener-
al, Gottfried knew he had his man to
join Chuckie Scales.

Osborn has always proven himself
an exemplary member of the team.
He is always alert in any game no
matter what position he is.in. He is
quick in maneuvers, fast in straight

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, November 7,1986

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

”lfl could take my team anywhere
to play volleyball, I'd take them to
Western Michigan,” said Coach Shel-
ton Collier. Tonight, Collier gets his
wish. The 2_4-9 Lady Panthers take on
the 18-4 Broncosat Kalamazoo.

No. 1 in the Mid-American Confer-
ence, Western Michigan has one of
the most highly respected volleyball
programs in the nation. The Broncos
are ranked slightly ahead of Pitt.

Coach Collier stated, ”We could
establish ourselves with a win over
Western Michigan. They will defi-
nitely be in the NCAA tournament.
They will be a team to contend
with." The Lady Panthers’ defeat of
a team’ like Western Michigan would
give them a chance to advance and
improve their NCAA seed..Pitt has
never played Western Michigan
before. ~

The h_ome—court advantage will
provide a definite edge for the Bron-
cos. Several years ago, WMU broke
the attendance record for drawing the
most people to a single match with
8,500 people. (Purdue broke this
record last year by entertaining a
crowd of 10,000.) Western Michigan

well in front of a huge crowd. Pitt has
been showing a lot of progress re-
cently and should be ready to play
also. ' ’

The Lady Panthers have a healthy
team with the exception of outside
hitter Denise Frawley. Frawley has
been unable to practice all -week.

Lady Panthers look
for shot at playoffs

Collier is optimistic that ”by resting
Denise all week, we hope to be able
to use her this weekend against
Western Michigan and Notre
Dame.”

Sunday, Pitt travels to South Bend,
lnd., to take on the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame. The Lady Panthers have
not played Notre Dame since 1984,
when they took a three-game sweep
here at Fitzgerald Field House. Both
teams have improved considerably
since then. .

Notre Dame, thanks in part to a ful-
ly funded volleyball program, is slow-
ly becoming a national contender.
Pitt hopes to be able to hang on and
defeat the Irish. The fact that the
match is being played in Notre

..»Dame’s own A&C Center this time

around gives an advantage to the Ir-
ish’s game plan.

The Lady Panthers are toughening
their game for the Big East and NCAA
tournaments. Coming off a strong
tournament at Penn State (as well as
a disheartening loss to’ the Nittany
Lions), Pitt is rising to the challenges
that a tough schedule demands.

On the agenda is the Ohio State
Classic next weekend. Thisiwill be
the fifth weekend the Lady Panthers
will be on the road.

Osborn-A-—

runs and has a keen eye to snatch
passes out of the air.

And he's also a really nice guy.

Though he will tell you he still
would like the passing position, he
never, in any way, tries to discount
any other member of the team, in-
cluding the people occupying the po-
sition he was originally selected for.
This includes John Congemi.

’’I really have nothing but respect
for John,” said Osborn. ’.’ln practices,
it is really good to see how hard he
works on the field, and it really
makes you feel bad to know you're
not doing your best when John is out
there giving it his all.” r - J

The coaching staff also knows of
Osborn’s talents and endearing qual-
ities. Coach Steve Coury said, ”Bill
had the best spring out of anyof the
receivers.‘ It seems like he catches
everything, and he always finds a
way to get the job done. He's got a
great attitude.” .

This season Osborn has really been
able to show himself. He has a 12.6
receiving average in 28 receptions for
352'yards and two touchdowns.

So what about the quarterback po-
sition for.tomorrow’s game? Well, it
just may not be-in the cards, but this
fan willtell you that if Osborn does‘
go in, he will give it his all.

There is a rumor circulating that
Osborn may be thinking of playing
this year for the basketball team as
well. It is true that while new Pitt
basketball coach Paul Evanswas still
coaching Navy, he recruited Osborn

_ to-be a player there. Supposedly, the

\

offer still stands.

What will come, only time will tell.
But if Osborn does decide to go for
the hoops this season,._ it will proba- ‘
bly be a plus for Pitt and yet another
accomplishment for a truly good and
deserving athlete.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, November 7, I986

Swimmers looking for second win at KSU

By Beth Froelich

Sta ff Writer

The Pitt men's and women's swim-
ming and diving teams will travel to
Kent State University today to partic-
ipate in the second meet of their
season. I

I The Panthers also hope to pick up
the second win of their season after
defeating Duquesne last week.
Defeating Kent State should not be a
problem for either team. The men
beat Kent State last year 65-44 and
the women won with the score of
87-52.

Pitt men's swimming coach Fred-
dy Lewis feels the Kent State team is
especially weak this year due to the
loss of five of their strongest freshmen
scholarship recruits to Proposition
48. Proposition 48 makes any incom-
ing freshman who did not achieve a
2.0.GPA'in highschool or a 700 SAT
score inelligible to participate in
college-level sports until he improves
his grades.

”We are looking for Kent State to
have one good man in every event,
but they certainly are lacking the
depth that we have," commented
Coach Lewis.

Speaking of freshman recruits,
Lewis feels they have had _a very posi-
tive impact on the team this year.

"Overall, I couldn't be more

pleased with our freshman team
members. They have really raised the
level of competetiveness by racing in
practice. They push the upper-
classmen by raising the level of the
training._They have added a lot of
depth to the team," commented
Lewis.

In the meet against Duquesne last
week, the coach did not swim the
upper-classmen in their best events.
However, he will swim the upper-
classmen” in their best events this

' week.

Lewis explained, ”Switching
events as such keeps the kids fresh
for their top events. Swimming the
same event every meet would make
them stale. We are very fortunate to
have the depth in our team which al-
lows us the luxury of switching
events and still winning.”

The outlook for the women's team
is just as bright. Freshman Sandy Al-
bright set a school backstroke record
in the first leg of the medley relay in
the first meet of the season with a
time of 0:27.44. The previous record,
set in 1984 by Tracy Pfister, was
0:27.88.

''It is a substantial achievement for '

a freshman to achieve such an honor
in the first event of her first collegi-
ate meet. If this is any_indication of
her future performances, we can ex-
pect a great season from Sandy,”

ing their best performances, and this

team that we are," added Belowich.

Belowich is optimistic that the

on top in the meet against Kent State.
He also pointed out, though, that he
won't be using their strongest line-up

x

in the meet. He feels it is important

to switch the line-up to keep the

swimmers fresh. ..
”We are in ‘a nice position. Be-

cause we are a strong team, we can I

modify the line-up without sacrific-
ing our strength,” he said. '

Silk gives punch to volleyball

By Sharon Haney

For The Pitt News

Lori Silk is making quite an impres-
sion. in her first year at Pitt.

A freshman from Johnstown, Pa.,
she has been a significant player on
the Lady Panther volleyball team. Silk
challenged junior Louise O'Shaugh-
nessy for the starting set position,
which O’Shaughnessy eventually
won. But Silk has been played many
positions since.

‘ Head coach Shelton Collier said,
"Lori has been really valuable in a
number of positions. She's really ver-
satile. She's also surprisingly confi-
dent for a freshman in whatever role
we use her in."

At Richland High, Silk led the
Rams to two consecutive state cham-
pionships in 1984 and 1985. Silk was
a middle hitter, so the setting position

was new to her.

'’It’s exciting, because it's a change,
and it's up to you to get the ball up
there for the hitters. You're also
responsible for running the team,”
stated Silk.

Coach Collier worked with Silk at
volleyball camp and was impressed
with her attitude.

’’I felt Lori was the best all-around
high school player in the state. She's
highly skilled."

Lori started playing volleyball be-
cause her sister played. Her parents
have always been supportive and in-
fluenced her along with her- high
school coach.

Lori chose Pitt over several other
schools "because -of the strength of I
the volleyball program. Plus my
major is physical therapy, and I was
impressed with Pitt's program.”

While at Richland, Lori was a
member of the NationalHonor So-
ciety and - earned three letters in
basketball, three in volleyball and

Driesell will
miss coaching

By Gordon Beard

AP Sports Writer

BALTIMORE (AP) — The Competi-
tive fire still burns in Lefty Driesell,
the deposed University of Maryland
basketball coach.

On Monday,» only five days after he
resigned under pressure, Driesell said
he already misses the job that has
been his passion since 1955.

While claiming to be relaxed and
feeling financially secure in his new
job as assistant athletic director,
Driesell left little doubt that his first
love is coaching. '

"I'll probably want to get back 
I have the urge already,” Driesell told
The Associated Press in his first inter-
view since ending his 17-year coach-
ing career at Maryland last week.

''I'm not going after anybody’s job,
but if they contact me, I'd be interest-
ed in talking,” Driesell said by tele-

phone from his home in Silver

Spring, Md. ’’I can still coach. I might
even enjoy coaching‘-in the NBA.

"Who knows, I might just like my

'new job,” he said. ”I won't miss the
recruiting, the travel and the daily
headaches.”

But longtime friends and associates
are convinced Driesell ‘ won't be
away from the coaching bench for
long. Some predict he will be back
coaching as soon as a job at a major
school is available. 7

"He has the urge to come back
right now,” Florida coach Norm
Sloan correctly forecasted over the
weekend. "If someone wants him,
he'll be back. We all know that.’’_

'’If that's what he wants to do, the

‘ opportunity will be there,” North

Carolina State coach Jim Valvano
said.

'’He’ll be a strong candidate to
coach anywhere in the country,” said
Southern Calilfornia coach George
Raveling, a former assistant to
Driesell at Maryland.

Driesell said he couldn't make a
commitment now but added: ’'I love
to coach, and after 32 years I don't
know how I'll react. Right now, I'll

have to wait and see. I have a good

job and financial security.” '

Under a renegotiated eight-yearl

contract, Driesell, 54, has been as-
sured of at least $136,000 annually
for the first four years. The universi-

_ ty will also continue to sanction his I

summer basketball ‘camp which has

earned him as much as $70,000 in
. recentyears. ,  V ‘ —

Testaverdl No. I Miami against Pitt

  
 

 

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

The time has come. How inop-
portune.

Vinny Testaverde and the No. 1
Miami Hurricanes have come to Pitt
Stadium, only to find the Panthers

disabled by injuries to many of their .

best players, incl_uding'quarterback
John Congemi.

Congemi injured his back last
week against Syracuse, leaving
Coach Mike Gottfried without an ex-
perienced quarterback. Gottfried
must choose between juniorJoe Felit-
sky and junior college transfer Sal
Cenilla should Congemi prove una-
ble to return.

Miami coach Jimmy Johnson, con-
versely, has Testaverde as his starting
quarterback.

Testaverde, a 6-5, 2I8—pound fifth-
year seniorfrom Elmont, N.Y., led his
team to the Sugar Bowl against Ten-
nessee last year, his first bowl as a
starter. He finished fifth in the Heis-
man balloting and is expected to win
it this year. He made almost every
All-America team imaginable during
the preseason.

There's more. Testaverde runs the
40-yard dash in less than 4.8 seconds.
He can squat more than 500 pounds
and bench press more than 325. He
has a vertical jump of almost 30
inches. -

66

We're gonna be
ready, definitely.
'— Michael Hadley

Johnson has been most apprecia-
tive. With Testaverde, he has turned
a good team into the best in the land.

”I think we have proven that we
have a good team,” said Testaverde.
”The victories are definitely satisfy-
ing, and I still have a lot of good feel-
ings about the team. I know we have
the talent to go all the way.”

Testaverde has not allowed his suc-
cess to go to his head. He is constant-
ly championing his team and its
opponents. Including Pitt.

”Pitt has always been a strong
team; I don't care what the polls say.
Also, they have beaten us before.
Right now, beating Pittsburgh comes
first in my mind. However, I still think
they are a great team and that we are
going to have to work if we want to
win.”

Testaverde said he has been
bothered by the never—ending specu-

lation about the Heisman Trophy bal— ~

loting. He places team success above
his personal success.
”As far as the Heisman goes, I'm

really not thinking about it. If it comes
my way, I'll be happy, but right now-
our remaining games come first, the
Heisman second.”

Coach Johnson is equally happy
about his success, but he shows as
much humility as Testaverde does,
because he knows how fleeting suc-
cess can be. But he continually sings
the successes of his star passer.

”|n football, the team is, what
comes first, where every player is im-
portant. We're all in this together,
and everyone on the team realizes

this. Along with being a great player .

in his own right, Vinny isalso a ter-
rific team player.

”I’ve said it before, and I will con-
tinue to say it: I think Vinny Testaver-
de is the bestquarterback in college
football.” .

Pitt fans will find out for themselves.
today.

The Panthers have 13 players on
injury lists; most notable is the loss "A
ofJohn Congemi. But Pitt will have
to make due.

”We’re gonna be ready, definite-
ly,” said freshman cornerback
Michael Hadley. ”This game‘ is a real
challenge to us. We may not be 100
percent physically, but if we_can-
reach a peak at any point in the sea-
son, this is the game.” I

As the sports information depart-
ment has propagated all season,
you're in for a game.
