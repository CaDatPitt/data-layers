Home run remembered

Senior Staﬂ” Writer

Like manyyoungfans in1960, George
Skornickel missed most of Game 7 of
the World Series because he was in
school. Luckily for Skornickel, he ar-
rived home for the best part.

With his high school located near
his house, Skornickel hurried home at
the endoftiiedayandsatdowninfront
of the television just in time to see Bill
Mazeroski make history by hitting his

World Series-winning home run over 4

the wall at Forbes Field.

nickel still remembers the momentlike
it just happened.

“Next thing I remember is my
mother going around with a ﬂying
pan and awooden cooking spoon and
banging that  like it’s the end of

®ﬁﬁE£‘r®N: An article in yesterday’s paper, “SGB to revise constitution,” incorrectly stated the outcome of a vote on allocations for the Society of Women Engineers. The
Board voted 5 to 1 with one abste_ntion, to grant the group $1,565.60 to attend a conference. Board member Molly Stieber abstained from the vote. _
Also, an entry in this month’s Dining Guide incorrectly stated the phone number and hours for Campus Deli. The deli’s number is 412-683-3200. It is

TEACHING EXCELLENCE LECTURE

The first fall School of Arts and Sciences Teaching Excellence Lecture will be held on
October 19, 2010, from 3-5 p.m. in the Martin Room on the fourth floor of Sennott Square.
The featured speaker is Carlos Cortes, PhD, professor emeritus of history at the University
of California, Riverside.

Cortes is a nationally renowned scholar, author, and consultant and serves as the creative/
cultural advisor for Nickelodeon's Peabody-award-winning children’s television series, Dora
the Explorer and its sequel, Go, Diego, Go! His recent books include The Children Are
Watching: How the Media Teach about Diversity and The Making——and Remaking—of

a Multiculturalisl. His presentation is titled “The Changing Face of America.“ A reception in
the Martin Room will immediately follow the presentation.

 p.m. in Ballroom A of the University Club, Cortes will perform his one-man autobiographical
play, A Conversation With Alana: One Boy’s Multicultural Rite of Passage. Refreshments will

be served after the play.

The lecture and performance are sponsored by the Ofﬁce of the Associate Dean of
iUntiergraduate Studies. Both events are open to the campus community and students
attending either event will receive OCC credits.

“[The Nazi] experiments and those conduct-
ed in 'D1skegee, Ala., were the catalysts for the
enactment of more astute regulations regarding
ethical standards,” said Dr. Scott Curry, a current
member of the Institutional Review Board atthe
University of Pittsburgh.

The Institutional Review Board monitors
experiments involving humans to ensure that
they meet ethical standards.

is just different These are generally accepted
rules.” _

These rules were formed to address public
concern. All of the researchers interviewed said
that ethics have developed because researchers
value the input of the community.

Dr. David Barnard, member of the Center
for Bioethics and Health Law at Pitt, said that
researchers have more concern for the public
view of current medical standards and how it can
affect conﬁdence in medical research.

° e those in Tuskegee or Guatemala. It IS lmpossrble.

Educational institutions created organiza-
tions, like Pitt’s IRB, across the country in re-
sponse to both the Tuskegee experiments and
those conducted by the Nazis.

Curry explained the IRB review process: “A
research study is reviewed thoroughly, detail
by detail. There is a checklist that investigates
how the scientiﬁc world would view the e>q)eri-
ment and how the community would View the
experiment.”

That checklist holds all necessary compo-
nents of an ethical study. Some questions include:
‘Are the risks to subjects reasonable in relation
to the anticipated beneﬁts, if any?” and “Will
informed consent be soughtfrom each prospec-
tive subject?” .

Fischer said, “The current concept of medical
ethics today is that no research canbe conducted
on human subjects" without informed, nonco-
erced and voluntary consent. The feeling now

“This is ahuge reminder to the scientiﬁc com-
munity that the future of science relies heavily
on the general public perception of trustworthi-
ness,” Barnard said. “Without trust in the work
that we researchers conduct, nothing can move
forward. These discoveries have caused an enor-
mous setback.”

. The public should be comforted to know,
however, that the current regulations make it
highly unlikely for anything like the Guatemalan
experiments to occur in the ﬁllllre, he said.

Curry agreed.

“I would like to think that the scientiﬁc re-
viewers of the IRB would immediately catch the
various discrepancies in the experiment, but if
they didn’t the community reviewers absolutely
would,” Curry said. “There is no possible way that
any govemment—funded experiment would ever
be conducted under unethical contexts like those
in Tuskegee or Guatemala. It is impossible.” ﬂ

EIJITORIAL

Take a sip of
green coffee  

ver try teaching a dog to play
E Mozart’s violin concertos?
We haven’t either, but
we’re hopeful that the image pro-
vides a useful analogy to what it’s
like to teach millions of American
consumers to bring their‘ opinions
to the cash register. Getting the
masses of self-interested shoppers
to care about anything other than
price, convenience and immediacy
is hard —— consumer values are
entrenched. And if asked to teach
consumers to suddenly care about
issues as distant as the environ-
ment and sustainability, you’d wish
you’d been given the dog and the
violin instead.

But, sometimes extraordinary

things happen, and for the sake ‘of
future generations, we hope this
shopping generation turns out to
be extraordinary. In a healthier
America, citizens would regard
the art of shopping as more of
a form of political participation
— as a way to push companies to
make changes they desire in the
world. And if the entire country
demands more time to internalize
such radical ideas, then for now, at
least let D.C. coffee drinkers ready
themselves.

Green building practices are
coming to Starbucks inside the
Washington, D.C. beltway.

According to The Washington
Post, Starbucks Corp. is pulling
out all the eco-friendly stops for
all the newly built and renovated

company-owned coffeeshops in the ‘

D.C. area. Recognizing that close to
75 percent of its environmental
footprint comes from retail, Star-
bucks plans to retroﬁt these stores
— about 100 —— with energy— and
waste-conscious devices like LED
lights and low-ﬂow faucets, aiming
to one day derive 50 percent of its
energy from renewable sources.

But perhaps the most unique el-
ement of Starbucks’ plan is to cer-
tify all new company-owned stores
through the U.S. Green Building
Council’s certiﬁcation program.

The council is a nonproﬁt that
works with companies to pro-
mote green building practices by
encouraging them to meet its rig-
orous Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED)
standards. The Post article reports
that only 6,000 buildings are cur-
rently LEED certiﬁed. In a sepa-
rate report released by the council,
only 25 Pittsburgh buildings and
no Pitt buildings were certiﬁed as
of 2008.

Investing so much in sustain-
ability is a brave move for a com-

pany that had to close 400 stores ’

during the recession. Without re-
leasing the projected costs of its
green building initiative -— or any
information regarding the time
and effort being expended to col-
laborate with the U.S. Green Build-
ing Council — Starbucks has ac-
knowledged it’s been “pricey.” And
it’s a ﬁnancial risk that Starbucks
deserves respect for taking.

But we’re not out to shower
praise onto any one coffee chain —
we’re trying to highlight the kind of
practices consumers of the future
should want to see in their busi-
nesses.Just as shoppers erupt with
delight when they encounter a “30
percent off ” sticker, so too should

they walk into storefronts that .

display the USGBC label on their

windows or recycled ﬂoor tiles in ‘

their foyers. Once the consumer
mindset changes, progress could
proceed faster than ever before.
Changing the world is only a mat-
ter of carrying ideas -—— instead of
just coupons — in your purse, and
you don’t need to send little Spot
to music lessons to do it.

UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

Booze hiatus eye—opening

Taking a break from drinking endowed Jacob with restraint.

 
  

Columnist

There’s a lot of boozing in college. I

That’s a fact.

Even my fellow Pitt News col-
umnist Katie Azzara touched on the
signiﬁcance of drinking last week

— in her column when she discussed

transitioning into the bar scene as a

new 21-year-old. Speaking from ex— .

perience, I can say that being oflegal
drinking age changes everything.
With the exception of a few holi-
days and smaller house parties, when
most people turn 21, they don’t turn
back. Even with the incurred costs
that are well above those of the av-
erage weekend house-party scene,
those of us who are able to barhop
usually keep on blowing cash on a
weekly basis. 0
Bars essentially become to college
students what churches were to com-
munities before the 18th century:
hubs for congregation. The big differ-
ence is that churches didn’t quite lend

Jacob Brown ~

themselves to being spots to pick up
one-night stands.

For many legal drinkers in col-
lege, it would be diﬂicult to imagine
living in sobriety for an extended

- period of time — it’d be equivalent

to having a primary social activity
eliminated. Or at least that’s what I
thought before I had to do it.

.Following recommendations
from a few doctors, my family and
my inﬂamed liver, I realized I had
to take it easy for a month whﬂe I
recovered fromaratherunexpected
bout with mononucleosis.

At ﬁrst, I tried to compensate
for my inability to drink. I went to a
bar only to order a ginger ale, trying
to feel comfortable. But that really
wasn’t possible.

When your 21—or-older friend
—- under the inﬂuence of alcohol,
of course —— mentions to everyone
you’re being a “pansy” for the night,
feeling a sense of comfort becomes
difficult. It didn’t help that this
friend also told the entire crowd I
had mono.

I might‘ as well have had the bu-
bonic plague, or that’s at least how I
felt by the time he was done. So after
two hours of feeling like an outcast,
I left that bar to meet up with some
other friends.

There, I switched toroot beer.
Butwhen I, ordered my drink, it took

‘a few moments for the bartender to '

process the idea thatIwasn’t having
alcohol. - . ‘
Each instance had its own mo-
ments of awkwardness. Since then,
I’ve opted out of going to bars for
as long as anything alcoholic other

A than mouthwashhasbeen verboten

to me.
. Meanwhile, I’ve had to ﬁgure out

what a senior in college does when .

he can’t go to the weekend water-
ing hole. To my surprise, Pitt Stu-
dent Health Service’s most recent

statistics report that more than half '

of the student body has experience
with heavy drinking. According to
the 2006 survey, 51 percent of Pitt
students drankﬁve or more drinks in

it’s really tasty. I love a good steak like
Amy W'mehouse loves cocaine and
bad haircuts. You’d sooner see me
spending 11 bucks on a post—“Signs”

ing in line for the vegetarian option.
But for everything I do that would
deface the great soy—based meal that
all you vegans just made for dinner, I
still can’t root for Michael Vick.
Now, I’m a huge football fan. Al-
though my talents are restricted to
simulating games of Madden, there
is no better feeling than spending a
Sunday afternoon not studying for
exams. Outside of befriending Neil
Patrick Harris, I can’t think of any-

thing more exciting than watching
my beloved Cleveland Browns win
— unfortunately, both events have
about equal chances of happening.
But let’s be real, football entertains
us like Michael Jackson: We love the
performance, but we’re pretty sure
that, eventually, somebody is going
to jaiL .

Professional athletes have not al-
ways been immune to legal troubles.
Ifthere were ajonas Salk ofthe athlete
world, it would have to be Johnnie
Cochran, who defended 0.]. Simpson
in his now infamous murder case.
These days there’s a laundry list of
athletes who can’t stay out of trouble
any better than Ryan Seacrest can
keep a fanbase.

There’s a reason that this article
isn’t about football players in general
though. As we live in Pittsburgh and
as Ben Ro ethlisberger hasjust gotten
permission to return to the ﬁeld, it
seems that I should be writing about
whyl can’t rootfor Big Ben. Well, I will
never root for Roethlisberger. What
he has been accused of is despicable

Vick doesn’t deserve cheer

— but that’s not the point. -
There is a striking difference that
can’t be ignored between Ben and
Vick: Roethlisberger. is boring like
a non—World Cup soccer game. Yes,
he might be one of the top producers

and undoubtedly amazing. In fact,
according to CNBC, his jersey was

2009 offseason: The man hadn’t

watch as a high school dance before
the punch gets spiked. People watch
Steelers games because they want
to see the Steelers. When Roethlis—
berger was riding the bench, they
still ﬁlled the stadium. Michael Vick
is different.

Vick is awonderto watch. He can ‘

run down a football ﬁeld in Usain Bolt
time and throwafootballlike France
can throw in the towel during armed
conflict. Vick dazzles on the ﬁeld with
his abilities and turns the game into a
one-man show. He is elusive, strong

Michael Vick.

With football, there are things that
matter more than the game. I grew
up in Ohio: Iwill always be a Browns
fan. It doesn’t matterthatweekin and
week out I’m watching some of the
worst football in the league. Where
else does that happen? There is loy-
alty in football to hometowns, alma
maters and roots.

Vickhas recentlybeen handed the
reins of the Philadelphia Eagles. Ac-
cordingto an interviewwith NFL Net-
work analystjim Mora, Vick believes
that his time in prison changed him

and made him realize his mistakes,
Since his arrest and subsequent jail
time, he really has done nearly ev-
erything asked ofhirn. He sat through
prison. He went MC Hammer bank-
rupt. He inadvertently gave huge
press to ariimal-rights advocates. The
last time anirnal—abuse cases were in
the media this much, Paris Hilton had
just bought her dog another purse.
With this new startingrole, Vick has

the opportunity to really redeem his

career and his life.

Unfortunately, nobody is going
to ﬁnd me cheering him on. It really
was never about him making up for
what he did. Vickwas one of the hand-
ful of athletes that could transcend
the loyalty of football fans. Football
has always been more than a game.
Our teams represent who we are as
communities. He was the one player
who could truly dazzle us. Then he

just had to throw it away as if to otball
were just a game. He cannever make
up for that.

Students depend too much on alcohol as a social lubricant

Brown 4 6

before the survey was conducted.

As part of the minority of Pitt
students during my freshman year,
I used to go to Friday Nite Improvs
at the Cathedral. I)/eryone I went
with has since graduated, however,
so I didn’t have any friends to go with
during my mono-induced drinking
hiauis.

Instead, Iwent to the casino once
and watched college football with
some friends another time during
my four—week break.

Otherwise, I spent my weekends
watching movies and updating my

resume. Iwouldn’t call it particularly
exciting, but it was a good change
of pace. .

The whole experience will cul-
minate this weekend, when I should
be able to grab the handle of vodka
I’ve had sitting in my fridge collect-

j ing dust for a month. But the results

of what changed from a month of
social isolation into an experiment
in sobriety have me in awe.

On average, before mono, I would
spend $20 to $30 on a single night’s
bar crawl, not including the obliga-
tory $5 pizza. With that money no

longer tied up in testing the func-
tionality of my liver, I had extra cash
to budget on eating out and other
goods I had put off getting — like
my Halloween costume.

I could also get started on work

earlier on Sundays without having
to shake off any residual effects from

the prior night’s activities. To para— _

phrase Ferris Bueller, if you have the
means to try out a stint of sobriety, I
highly recommend it.

But most of us legal drinkers
don’t. A good time often consists of

and havingﬁin, with alcohol actingas
the primary social lubricant. If you’re
not drinking, you’re not having fun,
or so we’re conditioned to think.

As a designated driver inthe past,
I’ve asked bartenders to put Sprite
into a cocktail glass so it would look
like a gin and tonic. It has certainly
made life easier at times, especially
when I’ve rim into people I went to
high school with who have asked me
about my drink of choice.

If my dry experiment has taught
me nothing else, though, it has taught

to be about getting “shwasted,” soon
after my 21st birthday, it turned into
a key for weekend enjoyment.

But now after not imbibing for
my longest stretch since turning
legal, the lack of alcohol has given
me an appreciation for moderation.
Perhaps that’s not a bad thing, con-
sidering excessive weekend forays
in drinking will only be fashionable
for graduating seniors like myselffor
another six months.

Internet is movie
buff’s best friend

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

Ifvideo killed the radio star; then In-
temet, itwould seem, killed the movie
stars. , 3 ' 3

It’s become fashionable among
those who follow the entertainment
industry to proclaim the Internet the
Destroyer of Worlds, a malicious and
unstoppable force bent on dissolving
all integrity any art once held.

On the surface, this is an apt la-
ment. It would seem that the devious
information superhighwayhasleltﬁlm
ﬂounderinginaworldwithout dignity.
Whereﬁlmwas once anAmerican pas-
time, it’s now a pirated novelty on a
disreputable website.

Where once itwas the subject of in-
depth criticism, it’s now at the mercy
ofI1VIDb forums.

Then again, would you have heard
of halfyour favorite ﬁhns without the
Web? '

The fact of the matter is, there’s no
medium better suited to the prolifera-
tion of artwork than the Net —- it just
takespeopleafewyears —or1o ——to
realize it. .

To aidinthisregand,I’vecompileda
list ofthe top-four reasons why people
should leamto stop worrying and love
the Web.

1. Online Film Communities: Yes,
Rotten Tomatoes and IM])b — two

sites ofgreatutilitybutabysmal intel- '

lect —- are popular, and theirusers’ ﬁlm
critiques are less than nuanced. But
there are also sites like Mubi, the /Filrn
blog and indieWIRE —— all of which
nourish speciﬁc subsets of cinephilia.

Mubi, in particular, is a ﬁlm buff’s

deligl1t—-asortofFacebookformovie ‘

lovers. Users create aproﬁle based on

theirﬁlmic tastes, theirfavorite direc— I

tors or styles of ﬁlmmaking and the

reviews they’ve written There’s even
a“wall” onwhichfriends cancommu-

. nicate.Theonlycomponentconspicu—

ously absent are sloppy party photos.
2. Online Streaming: When I say

 . online streaming, 1’rn not referring to’

the virus—laden videos overlaid with
Chinese subtitles that you’ll ﬁnd on
untrustworthy websites. I’rr1 talking
about Netﬂix’s Watch Instantly, a sur-
prisingly comprehensive, completely
legal altemativetoﬁlmic contraband.

Currently, it only offers about a ﬁfth

of the movies availableby mail, but

its roster is steadily expanding. Some
recent additions include “The Godfa-
ther,” “Donnie Darko” and “The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo.”

3. Fan-studio Communication:
Whenpeoplefound outthat NewLine
Cinema was making a movie with the
working title “Snakes on a Plane,” the
novelty-infatuated Net community
went into afrenzy. Blogs sprouted like
they’d been dousedwith Miracle-Gro,
as did a robust — perhaps over-ro-
bust —- network of fan merchandise.
Smartly, the studio decided to heed
fans’ advice, even reshooting scenes
at their suggestion -— scenes which
upped the ﬁlm’s rating from PG-13 to
the more ﬁscally precarious R. That
the movie was forgettable only slightly

' dampens its mythos — rarely have

everyday people held so large a sway
over a Hollywood production.

4. Obscure Movies: Let’s face it:
those ﬁlms that aren’t playing in a
cinema near you probably won’t be

. mentionedinprintpublicationswhen

it comes to mainstream newspapers
and magazines, only the biggest,
loudest movies make headlines. The
Internet, incontrast, grants everyﬁlm
everlasting life — the truism that if it
exists, it canbe found onthe Web is as
valid for movies as it is for anything.
Even information onthe most obscure,
art-house ﬂop isbutaGoogle or I1VlDb
search away.

Even more useful, however, than

the maintenance of ﬁlmic backwash
is the Net’s inﬁnite capacity to garner
cultfollowings. Movies like“Black Dy-
namite” and “The Room” didn’t make
a blip at the box oiﬁce, but they’ve
fostered dedicated fan communities,
replete with their own sites and mer-
chandise, on the Net.

The former is a tongue-in-cheek
parody of 1970s blaxploitation ﬁlms,
the latteris an alarmingly but enthral-
lingly awﬁrlcamp classic. Both ﬁlms
couldn’t have survived in mainstream
cinemas, butinthe decentralized nich-
es of the Web, they’ve ﬂourished.

This is rrotto saythatlnternet pirat-
ing is not ﬁscally crippling the movie
industry — it  Butwhen it comes to
passion, criticism and communication,
the World Wide Web might as well be
a gift from the celluloid‘ gods.

“Haiti Rising”

.A collaboration of artists

Today through Sunday
Kimbo Gallery
William Pitt Union
412-648-7815

Recently, most images of Haiti
have been of the destruction left
by the January 2010 earthquake.
But, a new exhibition hopes to
paint a different picture of Hai-
ti, utilizing a tradition that has
moved north to Pittsburgh and
now.has a large following in the
city -- Haitian art.

This week, from Oct. 14-17, the
Haitian Art Society will present
an exhibition titled “Haiti Ris-
ing” in the.Conney M. Kimbo
Art Gallery of the William Pitt
Union.

The title of the exhibition
represents Haiti’s ability to rise
from the disaster, Bill Bollen-
dorf, a member of the Haitian
Art Society and organizer of the
event, said.

The exhibition intends to in-

- form not only on the subject of

Haitian art, but on the strength
of the Haitian culture in general,
according to both Bollendorf and
Marcus Rediker, a professor of
Atlantic History at Pitt.

‘fWe want to educate people. .

We want to inform people in a
positive way,” he said, “We would
like the ballroom to be full.” 4

Bollendorf has traveled to and
from Haiti at least once a year for
36 years. Hehadores Haitian art

because you can’t not get inter-
ested when you go to Haiti,” said
Bollendorf.

For this particular exhibition
30 to 35 paintings from an assort-
ment of local Pittsburgh collec-
tions —— made up of more than of
25 different artists —-will ﬁll the
Kimbo Gallery. Every painting is
from a local collection, including
his personal one.

ﬁrst visit to the country, he said,
there was no way for him not to
like the art.

“I got addicted to the art. I
got addicted to the country,” he
said.

In 1979 ~ five years after he
began visiting Haiti —. Bollendorf
started to sell Haitian art_in the
Pittsburgh area. The popularity
of Haitian art continues to grow
in and around the city.

“I got interested in the art

Ballroom. He plans to focus his
lecture on Haitian surrealism.
“I am very interested about
how surrealism actually reached
its highest and most inﬂuential
forms in Haiti,” Rediker said.
He also said he will speak on

the aesthetic of realism in Europe

in comparison with the aesthetic
of voodoo in Haiti. The lecture
will discuss the secular versus
the spirit base that Haitian art
typically portrays.

Cuban art speaks abouttabootopics  

Larissa Gula
Staﬁwri ter

Alejandro de la Fuente wasn’t able to see
the exhibition he curated, “Queloides:
Race and Racism is Cuban Contemporary

. «.Art,” when it appeared in Havana earlier

this year because he was banned from
the country for using the word “racism”
in the title. .

“This is the ﬁrst time in post—revolu-
tionary Cuba the word ‘racism’ has ap-
peared in the title of an exhibition,” Fu-
ente explained. “I was banned from Cuba
and from going to this exhibit because
this is an uncomfortable issue in Cuba.
It has been treated like a taboo. People
have claimed there are no racial prob-
lems, so when you do an exhibit like this,

 you go against decades of official silence.

That made.some people unhappy. But they
didn’t dare censor the exhibit, so it was
shown.” ‘ .
Fuente stayed informed through re-
ports and was pleased that the exhibit in
Havana was well attended despite a lack
of press. News got out by word- of-mouth
instead. For now, though, his ban remains

in place.
Fortunately, Fuente will now have the
opportunity to see the exhibit featuring

‘ the work of 12 Cuban artists. Currently

in the Mattress Factory, it addresses the
issues of racism and prejudice that the

A Cuban government denies exist.

Fuente, a University Center for Inter-
national Studies research professor of

history and Latin American Studies, and
his co-curator, Cuban artist Elio Rodriguez
Valdés, organized the exhibit together.
The title alone brings perspective to
this exhibit, according to Fuente, who
is a Cuban-American with family in/both
countries. “Queloides” are wound-induced
scars. The title is meant to raise discussion
of racial stereotypes within the Cuban cul-
ture, as well as the process of healing from
traumatic racism and discrimination.

cause it’s a medical term,” Fuente said. “It’s
pathological scars created by wounds. In a
sense the exhibit refers to social, cultural
and personal scars racism creates.”
Fuente and his co-curator met in 2007,
when Valdés was showing his own artwork
at Frick Fine Arts. Fuente offered to help
bring the already existing “Queloides” to
America, enlisting the help of the Latin

 

American Studies department at Pitt and C

contacting the Mattress Factory.
“Que1oides” features multiple instil-

lations from paintings to photographs
to sculptures, as well as medial-based -

artworks. Each artist brings a different
perspective to the exhibit. For example,

A Valdés created one piece presenting a

series of monstrous-looking beings.. An-

other piece portrays people as faceless

and lacking in identity. A
The Pittsburgh exhibit is larger tha

the exhibition which took place in Havana
earlier this year. .
“What brings the exhibit together is
a common theme —— the persistence of
racism in Cuban society and by extension
racism in the rest of the world,” Fuente
said. “It invites people to think about ra-
cial stereotypes and prejudice.”
~ The racial problems in Cuba cannot be

pinned down any more easily than a lot of =

racial problems in America, said Lindsay
0’Leary, public relations and marketing

manager at the Mattress Factory. The most I

noticeable sign of trouble is a lack of high-

placed job positions for minorities in the

tourism business. , . I ~
The difference, however, is that Amer-

icans talk about the problem. In Cuba,

the government suppresses discussion
of racism while claiming the existence
of ‘equality. ‘ '

» Since the 1990s, Cuban artists in par-
ticular have made it a goal to speak'up,i
using their talent to ‘deliver their mes-
sages. . p ‘ A _ - '

a sculpture from 1440.

It’s the whole picture is worth 1,000
words saying, without using words.””

The Mattress Factory staff has also
treated this exhibit differently due to its
controversial nature.

“We treat the artists exactly the same
as far as the process, but there is a big
story here about a bigger issue,” O’Leary
said. “In the little world of the Mattress
Factory,_nothing has changed. But the fact
that the curator used ‘race’ [in the title]
and it’s stopping him from going home, is

pretty ridiculous.” -- . ,
“Queloides” actually follows a previou
exhibit at the Mattress Factory featuring
Cuban artwork in 2004, O’Leary said.
“At that time none of the artists could
come up because of U.S. and Cuban rela-
tions,” she said. “It was difficult because

we had to do everything by phone and fax

to get the exhibit set up.”

Fuente knew about this and proposed
that “Queloides” come to the Mattress Fac-
tory next, since it ﬁts within the Mattress
Factory,’s progressive and controversial
themes. g

been interested in Haitian art for a long
time; He has his own personal collection

of art, he said, and has been involved pas— ‘

sionately with it for a number of years,
lecturing on it in the past.

Both the exhibition and Friday lectures
are free and open to the public. Anyone
is able to view the art during the four-
day display, as well as attend Rediker’s
lecture.

At the exhibition there will be two
posters for sale, said Bollendorf. Each
one costs $10, and will be featured in the
Kimbo Gallery during the exhibition.

All of the proceeds from the sale will
beneﬁt a project at the Smithsonian In-
stitution called Haitian Cultural Recovery
Project. _

This project restores the art that the

Redikerhopes for the audience to see
“the triumph of the human spirit under the

most difficult of circumstances,” he said. 4
“Haiti has ‘had a hard road throughout «

its history.” —
“It is beautiful, vivid, vibrant art that
has a real power to it,” he said. i

Bollendorf believes that Haiti will come
out of this dark period in its history, and
that the exhibition will exemplify that.

“They are strong, proud, digniﬁed and
spiritual to the point where you could al-
most call them magic. They believe in God,
and that God will take care of them,” he
said. “They believe, in the spirits.” , _

He’s part of the Garne7 Gang, some

of the original people to listen to the _

broadcast, and he said the carnara-

’ ‘ derie between fans is what keeps him

coming back.

“The six ofus have nothingin com-
mon except this,” he said. “You meet
all these people and they share their
stories. It’s just a great day.”

Some fans traveled long distances

V to attend the event, including Gene

Augustine, who arrived from Alaska.
He said he heard about the broadcast
a year ago while listening to the radio
and decided to make the trip. .
“Octoberis abeautiﬁiltimeto leave

’" Alaskawhenwinteris settinginand _
come to the beauty ofwestern Perm-

sylvania,” he said.

Augustinewas 8years oldin196o
and, like Skomickel, he said he made
ithomejustintimeto seethegame-

winner go over the wall in left center
ﬁeld.

“I was literally one block from the
school so I ran home and was able
to see the end of the game,” Augus-
tine said. “The Bucs were everything
then.”

Augustine’s brother-in-law Harry
Watson also made the trip for theﬁrst
time.

Watson, who was 12 years old in
1960, didn’t arrive home in time to
see the end of the game. He was stuck
 for a bus on the playground
and right before the it arrived, the
Pirates won the game. ‘L

‘‘We sang the Pirates song and all
that stuff on the way home,” he said

Watson said he didn’t knowyester-
day’s event would be so large. L

“It’s fun,” he said. “I didn’t know
therewas still apart of thewallthere,
I had not heard tha ”

A self—described die-hard Pirates
fan,Watson said the event allows fans
to feel like they did when the Pirates
had winningteams.

With the teams they have now, he
added, reaching .500 would be a big
accomplishment, though perhaps it
shouldn’t. The Pirates were even un-
derdogs goingup againsttheYankees
in 1960, Watson pointed out.

“The Yankees were a far better

‘team on paper,” he said. “They had

ously ﬂooded downtown Pittsburgh
in celebration.

Gathered with Watson and oth-
ers in yesterday’s crowd was Woody
Boyle, who traveled to Pittsburghfrom
Florida to listen to the broadcast in
Oakland. Seven years old at the time,
Boyle stayed homefrom school onthe
day of Game 7 and watched the win
 his aunts and uncles.

“It’s pretty cool [listening to the
game again,]?’ he said, sitting on the
grass right below Posvar. “Especially

_ sitting right here. Right there is the

mark, if you extend the fence, where
the ball went over, so I’m kindof like
right where the outﬁelderwas chasing

so I’ll have to tell him about it.”

Boyle said hehadwantedto attend '

the event for years, and then decided
if he was going to come, itwas going
to be for the 50th 

“This shows there are a bunch of

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

Nearing the end of high school, Mat-

playvarsity lacrosse at other schools.
But when he decided to attend Pitt for
its scienceprogram, hewaslookingfor
anotherwayto continue the sporthe’d
played since 10th grade.

“I saw they had a club team and
they seemed to play a lot of quality
teams,” Pham said. “Theyhadapretty
impressive record, so I tried outwhen
I got here.”

Now, as a junior midﬁeld captain
and team vice president, he’s leading

Jordan Frank:

There’s also an MCLA champion
championship, Frank said, which is
the Panthers’ ultimate goal.

“Whetherthatcanfeasibly happen ‘

within the nextyear or not remains to

be seen,” he said. “Right now, I’d say
we have our eyes on making playoffs

and competingwith Michigan, who is

usually the top team in our league.”

. Pham said that the last few years

that Pitt went to the playoffs, they’ve

been knocked out early. This year, the

team wants to get a couple of playoff

 The Panthers also want to ad-
vance to the Top 25 and remain there, _

he said.

That’s always a goalin the season."

the Panthers into a new season.

Pham’s teammate Jordan Frank,
who has played lacrosse since the
seventh grade, said the team is start-
ingFallBallwhich isjuststartingFall
Ball. ’

Pitt’s team is a member of the Cen-
tral Collegiate Lacrosse Association
Conference, part of the Men’s Colle-

giate Lacrosse Association, which is .
. a league for lacrosse teams across the

country. The Panthers are considered
aDivisionIclub lacrosseteambecause
of the size of the university.

In the spring, Pitt will play any-
where from 13 to 16 games against
schools both within and outside of
the division. This season, Frank said
the Panthers will travel to Florida to-
play the University of Central Florida
in the spring.

0 Frank said the Panthers have sev-
eral goals this season, such as return-
ing to the playoffs.

“Wealwayswanttomakeittoplay- A

offs,”Franksaid. “That’s alwaysagoal
inthe season. It’s challengingbecause
there arealot of good teams and only
two teams are goingto go to playoffs

cused on continuingto build camara-
derie among the players.

“We really thinkthatwill makeus
better,” he said. “We’re doing things
on and oifthe ﬁeld. We want to create
thattearn dynamic thatyou see atthe
Divisionllevel at otherschools. Hope-
ﬁilly, that will translate to competing
with Michigan.”

Franksaidthe opportunitytobuild
friendships through lacrosse is one
of the reasons he sought out the club
team wherihe arrived on campus. The
team offered opportunities not only on
the ﬁeld, but socially as well, he said.

“I assumed the guys on the team
would have the same personality
as me,” Frank said. “I’m really good
friends now with all the guys on the
team. They’re some of my closest
frien .” ' ~ '

What to “buy” and “sell”

1I1 sports right now

Excellent pitching staff makes Philadelphia Phillies favorites to iuin World Series, baseball shouldn’t adopt instant replay

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

 

Are you laughing at the 49ers? Do you want
Marc-Andre Fleury out of town? Well, hold
your horses -— it’s time for a round of buy
or sell.

Buy: Marc-Andre Fleury, trading at $5.5
million.

It took me four years to perfect my Fleury
impression, and I’m not going to let a bad
goal run him out of town. Yeah, Scott Gomez’s
game-winner on him last Saturday was well,
awﬁil, but do you know how Martin Brodeur,
Henrik Lundqvist and 'I‘uukka Rask are doing
this year? They all have goals-against aver-
ages over four. Let’s give Fleury more than two
games before we forget he won a Stanley Cup
at age 24: unless you really want journeyman
Brentjohnson to have thejob.

Pop quiz: Who is Max Hall?

A) The starting center ﬁelder for the 1915

Pirates.

B) A famous cough-drop purveyor.

C) The quarterback of the Arizona Car-
dinals.

The unprecedented lack of talent in the
NFC West this season, highlighted by undraft-
ed rookie quarterback Max Hall starting for
the division-leader Arizona Cardinals, means
owner Jed York’s texted guarantee that the

Let’s not beat around the bush: baseball
is slow.

That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but the D

sport needs to stay away from instant replay, or

- at least one that utilizes a challenge system.

College football’s instant-replay system
drew out two clear—cut calls at the end of
Pitt-Notre Dame game, and play dragged to
a standstill. Pitt’s last drive, all of four plays,

When I read the story about-the text, I
thought “O” when I didn’t see “jk” at the end

must havetaken 10 minutes, thanks to the
superfluous use ofbooth review. It’s not a rare
occurrence —— the same thing happened at
the end of last week’s game between LSU and
Florida. '

Baseball makes bad calls. The current sys-
tem ﬁxes some of those bad calls — fair versus
foul on home runs, for one. But if the league
institutes a challenge system, ﬁfty inconse-
quential ball-strike calls will be reviewed for
everyjimjoyce moment. It’s a slippery, mind-
numbing slope if there ever was one.

The correct direction for baseball: accu-

rately identify the best ofﬁciating crews for
postseason play. Once umpires start to miss
straightforward calls, it becomes a matter of
ﬁnding better ones — not adding replay.

Buy: Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt and Cole
Hamels, trading as World Series favorites

I take the Philadelphia Phillies over the Gi-
ants . I take them over the Yankees. If you gave
Halladay, Oswalt and Hamels abasketball, I’d
take them over the Heat.

I haven’t seen a pitching staff so domi-
nant since Arizona’s Randyjohnson and Curt
Schilling in 2001. Do you think Halladay and
Hamels tease Oswalt because he gave up a
run? Way to ruin it, Roy.

The Phillies kept Joey Votto, the odds—on
favorite to win the National League Most Valu-
able Player Award, to one hit all series. As
much as I love the Giants, they don’t stand a
chance in a seven—game series if H20 keeps it
up. San Francisco needs two more Tim Lince—

cums.

I haven’t even mentioned Philadelphia’s of-
fense, but that doesn’t matter. With the pitch— .»
ing stall‘ the Phillies have, if you gave Dwyane
Wade, LeBronJames and Chris Bosh baseball
bats, they could probably do the job. I

club and varsity sports. '

Club lacrosse isn’t paid for by the University,
Frank said, and the Panthers pay dues and fund-
raise. Dues usually amountto between $700 and
$800 per year.

Another main difference is that, in varsity
sports, everything is scheduled. The club la-
crosse team members coordinate everything

b themselves.

coaches and plan off-the—ﬁeld events,” Pham
said. “But you see the progress, and everything

The other assistant coach is Alex Perry, who

The team practices once or twice a week,

12:30 am. andThursdays from9to1o:3o p.m.As
aclub team, the group gets last dibs on ﬁeld times,
hence why it practices late at night. O’Brien said
the practice schedule highlights another key dif-
ference between varsity and club sports.

“Varsity athletes see each other every day,”
O’Brien said. “It’s our job as coaches to bring the
team together, to make this a good experience
instead of just horsing aroun .”

Frank said club sports still require a great

An Open Letter to the University of Pittsburgh Community Regarding
Harassment and Suicide of LGBTQ Students in the United States

To Whom It May Concern: A

The issue of suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer—identiﬁed youth has recently gained the attention of the national
media through coverage of the death of Rutgers freshman Tyler Clementi. -We are compelled to offer you a statement on behalfof the
Rainbow Alliance, informing you of the appalling truth behind the larger issues, beliefs, and attitudes that resulted in this young man’s
death. This case is quite far from being a recent development, yet evenfurther from being an isolated incident. In the last few weeks alone,
four other LGBTQ students have taken their own lives. And they will not be the last to do so. ’ A

Suicide is the second leading cause of death on college campuses, yet queer youth are up to four times more likely to attempt suicide than
their heterosexual peers (Massachusetts Youth'Risk Survey 2007). Social stigmatization, rejection by family members and friends, and a
whole host of negative perceptions and representations of homosexuality surround our LGBT youth as they grow up in this society. It is a
world where heteronormativity is equated with prestige and social worth, where divergence from the norm results in a state of second-class .
humanity. Our youth are bombarded with words and images that still portray members of the LGBTQ community as foreign or abnormal,
forcing them into isolation and loneliness as they struggle to ﬁnd a place where they are truly accepted. There is only so much. one human
being can shoulder, and one incident like this can have very serious consequences if it is merely another l.ink in the chain of dehumanizing
events in the life of a young person, LGBT or otherwise. incidents like this speak to society at large——~scream to this society-—that
something must be done in order to halt the forces that are driving our young people into depression and towards suicide. The rights to be
different and to exist freely and happily are key elements of the foundation upon which our country was built, and they are meant to exist in
practice as well as in principle. ' V

The Rainbow Alliance, as the only undergraduate LGBTQA organization at the University of Pittsburgh, defends the rights of all those
who are harassed, assaulted, ostracized, or dehumanized by attitudes and behaviors that result from the fear and ignorance that has been ‘
allowed to remain a part of this society. We defend the rights of all human beings, regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender identity
or expression, religious or political afﬁliation. We are committed to the idea that all students of the University of Pittsburgh are united as
brothers and sisters-the idea that we are all brought together by our common bond as Panthers rather than divided by the differences that
we have created for ourselves. . T

We wish to acknowledge that the University of Pittsburgh shares our commitment to a diverse and accepting-campus community and to
promote awareness of the issues that face non-normative students. It is crucial that we have visible supportfrom the “A” in our acronym,
our straight allies. You have the power to be a voice for an LGBT student who may not feel strong enough to speak with his own. You have
the power to save an LGBT student by having _a conversation, by being willing to understand and become educated, and by standing up
and ﬁghting againstthe. hateful and dehumanizing behaviors that lead so many of your peers to take their own lives’. It can be as simple as

_ thinking before you speak, write, or post online———-being mindﬁil of the fact that what you say canseriously affect the lives of those around
i you. An isolated incident for you may be the breaking point for a student who feels he has lost almost everyone and everything, and what

you may consider a joke or an inconsequential comment can lead to the unnecessary suffering of another human being. If you. are a student
who feels that this suffering has become too difﬁcult to combat,’ please know that it will get better. You are valued. You are loved. And you
are not alone. i A A

Our message, as LGBT students and allies, is simple: Treat others with the respect with which you wish to be treated, with the respect they

, deserve not only as citizens of this country but as human beings. Our hope is that the University of Pittsburgh community will become a

truly exemplary institution by committing to diversity without exception and by accepting the responsibilitypto protect and serve its diverse
student population in every way. i

- We cannot wait for another tragedy to strike. We cannot hope that someone else will solve these problems for us. We are the voices of

change, and in order to create that change, we must be heard.

If you would like more information about youth suicide in the LGBT community and what you can do to help, contact the Trevor Project at
310-271-8845. If you are student in need of services or know a peer who is struggling, contact the University Counseling Center or dial the
National Suicide Hotline at 1~800.—SUlCIDE.

Sincerely,
Dylan J. Drobish
Vice President, Rainbow Alliance
