Men To Establish \
Self-Government
In Schenley House

Schenley House residents de-
cided at airecent meeting to es-
tablish self government and plan
their own social events.

For the purpose of government
each of the four ﬂoor’s in the
dorm will elect one representative
to the body. ' '

A general election will be held
at a later date for the purpose of
electing a president and vice-
president of the group. The vice-
president will act as chairman of
the social committee to plan
events for the dorm.

A judiciary branch will be es-
tablished with six students and
the advisers of .each floor. This

group will make decisions on
minor violations of University
regulations.

The officers and each represen-
tative will meet soon to decide on
a name for the organization and
to establish a constitution.

Brackenridge House is expected
in time to arrive at a similar ar-
rangement. This will not be for
some time, however, due to the
necessity for strict supervision by

the ofﬁce of the Dean of Women.

medical authorities there is a
distinct possibility of an epi-

schedule. .

The United- States Public
Health Service has alloted ap-
proximately six per cent of the
total production of vaccine to
Pax, according to population.
Students’ fall into the second
priority, according to Doctor
Lucien Gregg, Cooridnator of
Professional Services in Falk
Clinic.

At the head of the priority list
are Health personnel, Police, Fire
an d Communications workers.
The second group is made up of
people who have had chronic ‘ill-
nesses which would make them
susceptible, students and the gen-
eral Public.

Production schedules of the
six licensed manufacturers
would have batches of the vac-
cine ready for students around
Nov. 15. “No one knows when
the epidemic will get hot and we
want to give the students the
beneﬁt of the vaccine as soon as
possible,” .said Dr. Gregg.

Junior Describes Tour

Queen Contest Candidate Returns

By ESTHER LATTERMAN

Ilene Rubenstein, a junior
in the school of education was
Pitt’s entry as queen to the
University of California’s 1957
Football Festival sponsored
by the Berkeley Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce, Sept. 15
through 22.

Upon arrival at Los Angeles
International Airport by Trans-
World Airlines early Sunday
morning Sept. 15, Ilene had break-
fast, at the airport, after which
she had a short rest.

M Met Girls

She was driven to the Sheraton
Town House Hotel, where she met
the other girls in the contest.
After lunch the girls posed by the
hotel in bathing suits for photo-
graphers.

The next morning, one of the
girls awoke with a fever and felt
ill. A doctor immediately report-
ed it to be the Asian Flu. Shortly
after this diagnosis, each girl was
“lined up” and innoculated with
the Asian Flu vaccine.

Ilene described the “shot” as.
painful, “but I had no after ef-
fects ecept for waking at 5 a.m.
two mornings later with a
strange sensation in ,my hip,
and after investigation, I found
that the other girls had this
same sensation.”

, After the surprise’ innoculations,
the girls received another sur-
prise. This one was more pleasant,
a television appearance on NBC
show “It Could Be You.” After
the television show, with promises
of no more wild surprises, the
girls had lunch with the Southern
California Sportswriters Associa-
tion.

Toured Disneyland

During that same afternoon, the
girls toured Disneyland, where
they were special guests of Walt
Disney, there the girls sampled
many of the rides. Ilene described
the place as “thrilling and fas-
cinating.”

Tuesday the girls flew to Oak-
land, California, and then left for
Berkeley, each in a convertible,
At Berkeley the girls were housed
at Lehrs’ Estate, a large private
home, complete with a swimming
pool. There the girls lived in close
quarters. To this Ilene remarked
“this is where we developed such
a close association with each
other, and I found myself together
with the most. wonderful group of
girls I have ever met.”

The tour included visits to the '

the hills.” Also included was a
Mexican dinner at the Fairmont

had breakfast around the pool at
Lehrs’ Estatg after which was a

She came to the University
from New York University with
her primary interest in Edu—
cation. Dr. Allen has also been
made available to the Univer-
sity at large as the first Coordi-
nator of Special Activities.

Dr. Allen has been a long-time
educator doing her first teaching
in the public schools of Georgia
at the age of eighteen. Her ex-
periences include not only teach-
ing in public schools and colleges.
but also positions in University
Public Relations.

Developed Programs

She served for the Red Cross in
the Central Paciﬁc during World
War II putting her many abili-
ties to good uses. She helped de-
velop programs and recreation for
all branches of the Service. It was
a morale type of job which.ex-
tended to units far off in isolated
areas as well as in club centers
and aboard ships.

The University of Pittsburgh
Chess Club will meet daily in
Room 324, Student Union, start-

which will meet twice weekly.
They should also denote the
time and days they can attend.
Instructions will be given by
outstanding players from the
Pittsburgh area. The member-
ship fee will be three dollars
per school year or two dollars
per semester.

In 1945 Dr. Allen went to the
University of Tennessee to
‘teach where she was Professor
of Physical Ed. and Recreation.
There she taught on campus for
‘six ‘months of each year and
‘traveled through the state for
six months developing state-
wide éducation and recreation
i programs. The latter six months
were spent teaching in rural
s areas and setting up leadership
training programs in the 95
counties of the state. ‘

American Academy of Physical
Education."

Attended New York
In 1951-52 she attended New
York University to study for her
doctorate degree. She returned
there in 1955 to become Chair-

man of Undergraduate Women's
Program in Physical Education. 1

Now we are privileged to have
her here for both the professional
school and in the interest of stu-
dent activities.

Allen is concerned with a
variety of co-education activi-
ties which should lead toward
the development of an All-
University S o c i a l—Recreation
Program. An initial step toward
this goal is the or.-zanizatimn of
groups at the Student Union in
Folk and Social Dance. .

Students with no previous ex-
pc-rience will be’ encouraged to
participate. Singing and other

special interests are to be present— _

are invited to enjoy the activities.

The first meeting for all dances

will be on Oct. 10 from 3 to 5 p.m.
Allen ‘has already had one
success with the Freshman
Class Party at ‘the Ballroom
uring Orientation Week. She
was delighted with the ifr."esh-
men. She cdmmented that al-
though they were hot and
crowded they were wonderful to
her, and they had a magnificent
spirit.
When asked about her welcome

"in Pittsburgh, Dr. Allen replied.

“I received a very cordial wel-
come,” with notes and calls from
many old friends and a warm re-
sponse from the University and
community personally. 1

, The school is getting into step and a rapid pace it is.
Everything is going at a faster and faster rate with the ex-
ception of the Cathedral elevators. There seems to be either
a pursuing doom or a rapidly receeding goal that is driving
this institution to greater things at a greater speed.

For those who knew the mallasses pace at which most
programs in the.-_University were carried out previously,
this is the era of salvation and rebirth.

But there is another side to the story which will
eventually ﬁnd attention and that is the physical and
mental limitations placed on students and faculty who have
impossibly crowded days and thousands of petty duties to
perform. -

This" category does not, obviously, include those who’
are unwilling to cooperate in things not directly connected
with the classroom. It does include those who have the
drive and interest and are paying the consequences in a
rapidly developing frustration of trying to -do all there is
to do‘and prepare to do all there will be to do tomorrow.

One student expressed this feeling recently. After
having a few words to say about the value and benefits of
the Midday Series, he aptly asked, “But when do we eat?”

’It is hard to see what lasting beneﬁt will be derived
from 45 minutes spent in the presence of great minds and
stimulating groups when the program must be sandwiched
between frenzied academic and extra—curricular activities.

Time is needed badly for the serious reﬂection which
should follow such encounters with greatness.

The argumentfor needed time couldigo on indeﬁnitely
and cover all the points of refutation and support but, un-
fortunately, there isn’t time. ~

‘Computing Center A Birthday . . ..

 

One Year Of Progress

‘By Carolyn Stasenlro

Just about this time last year, in a little room
on the eighth floor, a new department in the Uni-
versity was being formally opened. The opening

’climaxed over a year’s preparation, planning and

organization——the operation of a Computation, and
Data Processing Center was set in motion.

Work_on the organizing of such a center had
begun in the spring of 1955 when a University
committee was set up to inves-
tigate the possibilities in a serv-
ice of this type on the campus.
Finally, in January of 1956, after
careful study, the committee had
placed its order with IBM for a
type 650 electronic computer;
and by October, the computing
cented was ready to begin‘play-
ing its role in the University
program. I  V

The planning had been such

recognize the fact that the original aims are be-'
that the computing center would be enabled to de-
velop with benefits for the center itself, for the
University and for the community. Its function, as
stated by Director William B. Kehl,-is threefold:
(1) education, (2) the support of research programs
within the University, and (3) the development of
cooperative relationships with industry.

Now, one year after the center’s opening, the

University may look back at the development and

have been set for two new courses in the operation .

ing carried out. Pitt’s computing center is, in fact,
the only one in the city applying its usesto both

- business and education.

Education is, of course,-- the primary function of
the center. Inthis field, agiwhole program of
courses is being developed. Now being offered is

a course, in Numerical Analysis by Dr. Weinberger,

of Gulf‘ Research Laboratories. Three courses are
given in P.rogramming—-one"for-business applica-
tions, one for scientiﬁc purposes and the other for

program’s

Industrial Engineering. A course for executives in
Managerial Aspects of Electronic Data Processing
is being conducted by Ethan MacMichael, assistant
comptroller of the American Bridge Division of
U.S. Steel.

In addition, this fall a new course was intro-
duced in Advanced ‘Managerial Techniques; taught
by Dr. Kehl. To broaden the program, future plans
have. been set for two new cousesin the operation
of the machine——one for faculty members and one
for high-school students.

Through this move, the center hopes to attract
interested students for future work in computing.

_ To top off the value of the educational set-up, the

center is considering throwing open the machine’s
use to all students and faculty members in. the Uni-
versity. This would involve the machine’s opera-
Such a program would
obviously multiply the applications of the ma-
chine. '

The second function—-support of research "pro-
grams r ‘ithin the University itself—-has made pos-
sible the sponsoring of projects which otherwise
would not have been feasible. These projects are
being conducted daily by such departments as the
Radiation Laboratory, tl e Bureau of Business Re-
search, the psychology department and the cherri-
istry department.

The center’s third function deals with its con-
tacts with industry. By maintaining a close con-
tact with business and scientiﬁc research, the cen-
ter has enabled Pitt to better serve the community.
Problems in programming, testing and analyzing

have already been carried out and are continuing in

with such companies as Pittsburgh Consolidated

Coal, Pittsburgh Plate Glass and the National In- '

stitute of Cancer.

The little room-on the eighth floor has grownl

since its opening at this time last year. Physically,
it has been enlarged to better accommodate key
punch personnel. Educationally, it will continue to
grow with reciprocal beneﬁts in the two-way re-
lationship between University and community.

” One hundred and twenty years
ago this month, Oberlin College
in Ohio offered the first college
opportunity to women by accept-
ing four women as bachelor can-
didates.
This month ,

tradition and
t e in p e r a-
ment emphasizes learning with-
out the pleasant distractions of
male company. ,

. It may easily be seen that the
barriers at these citadels of all

girl education are beginning to-

crumble. The big news in higher
education this year is that, for
reasons of efficiency and econ-

omy, and academic reward more 
and more men and women stu—”

dents are studying together and
liking it. V ~«

Sarah G. Blanding words, “Ap—
plications to all-women’s col-

leges are ‘rising steadily every-

year. This indicates a trend to-
ward the purely women’s col-
lege, not away from them.”

The Woman ’Is Smarter

Quite a number of college
presidents disagree with Miss
Blanding such as, Katherine E.
McBride of Bryn Mawr, who
said, “I think the easy regular
association of -men and women
in college is excellent, distract-
ing to some, stabalizing to others
——but far more superior than
isolation.” A

Most of the males who are
this year desk to desk with girls
must graciously accept the fact
that their coed sisters are bright-
er than they. At Northwestern,
Dean of Men Joseph D. Boyd
has found‘ that, with 4.0 the~per-
fect grade, the yearly average
for men is 2.31 against a 2.37 for
the women. Authorities * from
colleges including Cornell and
the University of Southern Cali-
fornia agree that the women us-
ually attain the higher. grades.

Kate Hevner Mueller, professor _

culture today keeps
Women afraid that ‘they won’t
marry. On the contrary, there is
very little to keep a woman from
attracting an appropriate hug-
band, marrying happily and hav-

.The old myth that college
women couldn’t catch a husband
is long dead. Of the 2.5 million
women college graduates now
living, more than 1.6 million are
married. The ratio for recent
years is much higher.

A six year survey of girls at-
tending Chatham College showed
that 90% were married. iAt
Chatham graduation last June,
20 of the 90 graduating seniors
were already married. Such sta-
tistics educators have found to
be the rule rather than the ex-
ception. ' I

As is seen in the previous col-
umn the doors of colleges and
universities are being opened
wider to women seeking. their
M.R.S. degree, and those inter-
ested in specializing in pre-wed.

A illetters To The

Editor, The Pitt News:

If those who write about the
splendor of the University of
Pittsburgh were present at the
Oklahoma fiasco, perhaps they
winced a bit at the student dilem-
ma. It seems that the Pitt team‘
didn’t fare‘ much better on the
line of scrimmage than many of

’ the students at the entrance port-

als of the stadium. This is neither
the time nor the place to be fa-
cetious about Pitt football, how-
ever, a needed reconsideration «of
the students’ privileges is appro-
priate. .

Admittedly, the opening game
is an exciting affair andpmany

students feel_ moved to see their

alma mater defend its soul. How-
ever, whena university’ is unable
to provide ample seating facilities

for its ‘own students, I believe it

is time to evaluate what the hell
all this football game business’ is
about. Each student attending the
university pays a $24.00 fee for
the privilege of witnessing the
athletic events.

With a total .of 16,000 students
it seems a bit scant of the uni-
versity to provide a mere 5000
students seats in thestadium. If,
on the other hand, the university
prefers the cash-paying spectator

to the studentin its audience, then “

Etlitoriiil

perhaps it is justiﬁable inothto

obligate the student by such ath-
letic event fees. A i

It certainly appears ludicrous
when the students of a university,
unable to watch a gamein their
o_wn stadium because there are
too few seats or because‘ the en-
trance doors have been bolted
shut, see the remainder of the
stadium ﬁlled with comfortably-
seated observers. ,

If Mr. Litchﬁeld "is truly‘ inter-
ested in the student. and that

for Twain’s statement during
their eight day stay.

From the very beginning the
Bermuda segment of the Air Base
Tour promised to be different and
exciting.

pulled down from t.he sides of
the plane.

flight, members of the troupe sat
facing one another, much the

to view Bermuda Irom a different
prospectus,” Rheda concluded.

“The ‘bee in the Bermudan
bonnet’ is motor bikes,” ob-
served Myrna. “They are as
common as automobiles are in
America. Another interesting
oddity is their diminutive taxis
with surry-fringed tops. They
add to the care—free living in
Bermuda.”

A touch of home was brought
about by “Ye Olde Arthur Murray
Studios” down the street from the
hotel. “A dancing contest was held
there one night and one of the
troupe, Ben—Campo, Col. ’57 won

first prize.”

Commenting on the tour as a
whole, Miss Covert remarked,
“Our troupe was a pioneer group
for the university. Future tours
will proﬁt much from our experi-
ences.”

“It was a great privilege to
us all to be able to bring a
glimpse of home to our service-
men overseas. The playersVex-
perienced a wonderful feeling
using their talents to make them

happy,” she continued. . .

Miss Covert further comment-
ed that the trip was an excellent
opportunity to learn group learn-
ing and discipline; “I know,” she
concluded, “that Mr. McHale and
I brought back a much ﬁner group
than we took.”

For Southern California

By DAVID BREAKSTONE
With a greedy eye upon making a double killing while
in the Far West, the Pitt, Panther ‘will prowl on down t-he
coast this week to the vicinity of Los Angeles, Calif. _
On Friday evening, at the goliathan Memorial Coliseum,

\ the big Cat will tangle with the Southern California Trojans.

Hostilities will begin at 12:30 PST. (Pittsburgh Sleep Time).
The lean Blue and Gold footballers will be after their

second straight win. Oregon waso

the prey last week by a 6-3 kayo.
The home team is still looking for
victory number one.
. Conﬁdence Regained
The locals, according to the
traveling western correspondent,
have regained their early prac-
tice confidence and should have a
full head of steam going on Fri-
day night. Physically, the team
_came out an emphatic winner
against Oregon.
Only halfback Jim Theodore
.emerged from the rough" tussle
worse for wear. He sustained a
leg strain , which may prevent
much pre-game workout.
The Skyscraper stars will prob-

ably go into Friday evenings (or.

is it Saturday mornings) clash as s
the favorite. Their role as an .

Eastern power
Southern Ca’! sslow start account
for the edge. But the human ele-

, ment in the form of Pacific Coast

Conference officials could even up’

the contest quite a bit. They are"

known for their role as poor hosts.
Eastern Refs Assigned
Luckily for the Panthers, Asa
Bushnell, of the ECAC, has as-
signed two Eastern referees to
share the officiating chores. This
should act as a deterrent to par-
tisan politics on the part of the
home town hanky droppers.

The Oaklanders are in a bit
ofa nasty mood, which is us-
ually conducive to winning
football. It seems as though the
Oregon press was rather skep-
tical about the Panthers’ ability
as a football winner. In fact,
some members of the journal-
ism tribe went so far as to call
the last minute victory over the
Webfoots “a cheap win.”

Perhaps the best way to refute
the bitter charge is to look at the
statistics. The Panthers were
ahead in rushing yardage 200
yards to 140 for the Ducks. Pass-
ing statistics favored the winners
99 yards to 64. And ﬁnally, total
first downs showed a 1'’? to 11
Panther edge.

At Slippery Rock
The Panther Harriers, fresh
from‘ their 21-39 victory over

Coach aCrl Olson is guite con-
ﬁdent that the hill and dalers will
rack up victory number two. Top
ﬁnishers ﬁgure to be among John
Christ-of, Vince Timon, Ron Rush
and George Walters. Rush and
Walters are sophomores and seem
to plug the gap left by graduation.
The team is composed of one
senior, six juniors, and four
sophomores. Coach Olson com-
ments that his team is green
and inexperienced and will
need a few meets to round into
‘ form. ‘

"After traveling to ‘Slippery
Rock, the Olsonmen return to the
friendly course in Schenley Park
to meet the Ohio University har-
riers on Saturday, Oct. 12. These
meets, according to Olson,‘ should
add two victories to the Panthers’

All of this prompts one to
gather that Clark won’t be in-
itiated into the USC fold with
cake and honey. And so far this
season the West Coast squad
has proved this correct.

In two games, the Trojans have
scored just one touchdown. That
lone tally came against Michigan
last Saturday in a 16-6 contest.
Oregon State was tougher a week
before, shuting out the Warriors,
29-0‘. Well, at least Clark’s grid-
ders are showing a slight im-
provcment.

Faces Demson Saturday
_»A new two-platoon system and a trio of changes could
vault the Panther soccer team into a higher prominence this

year.

This platooning and the changes were tried out for the
ﬁrst time in last Saturday’s game against Akron U., and ap-
parently Coach Leo Bemis is very satisﬁed with the results.

“At ﬁrst I was only going to platoon the inside men on

the front line,” related the genialO

mentor, “but after seeing the
whole second line work Saturday

 -I. think I will be able to’use the
in entire line for platoon duty.”

Pleased With Shrinsky

Bemis’ starting line,n0w has
Sam Hazou at outside left, Chuck
Kane at inside left, sophomore
Pete Karavellis at center forward.
Jack Horox at inside right, and
Jim Graham at outside right.

His substituting line calls for
Bob Kalchthler, Lee Goodman,
-Jason Shrinsky, Simeon Pestich,
and Edin Ferrer from left to
right.

Bemis was particularly pleased
with center forward Shrinsk-y’s
-play. “The only soccer experience
Shrinsky has had was in the In-
=ter'f_raternity League last Spring,
but as far as I’m concerned he is

as/a pretty nice player right now.

He really demonstrates ﬁne fun-
damental play.”

Ah, at last the gridiron seers

three unanimous picks; happily,
the locals are one of the tri-

Last week’s weak predictions
turned out surprisingly vigor-
