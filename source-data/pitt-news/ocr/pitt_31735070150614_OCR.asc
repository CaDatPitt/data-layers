Along with his family, Pitt students and faculty
mourn the loss ofjohn D. Metzger, the director
of Pitt’s Nuclear Engineering Program. He died
on Oct. 12 at the age of 59, while travelling in
Atlanta, Ga.

Thirty students travelled to Reading, Pa., to
attend Dr. Metzger’s funeral on Friday, Oct. 19.

In Memoriam: Pitt Director of Nuclear Engineering John D. Metzger

people went to his funeral. Students really liked
him,” said Gerald D. Holder, U.S. Steel Dean of
Engineering in Pitt’s Swanson School.
Metzger was born in Reading on July 24,
1953. He later graduated from the nearby Wil-
son High School in 1971. Post—graduation, he
attended the University of Tennessee to receive
his Bachelor of Science in nuclear engineering.
He continued his education at the Univer-
sity of Illinois, where he received his Master

_ of Science in nuclear engineering in 1977, and

in 1989 he went on to get his Ph.D. from the
University of New Mexico.

He is survived by his three children, Ra-
chel, Matthew and Jennifer and his mother,
Lukrezia.

Matthew remembers his father as a very
upbeat, positive person who went to great
lengths to help everyone out.

“He had a really big heart. From us, to his
students, to coworkers, to his mother, he went
beyond the work environment, and he really
did care about everyone he came into contact
with,” Matthew said. “He tried to help those
people. He always made sure _we fulﬁlled our
commitments, because that was the person
he was.”

Metzger’s daughter, Rachel, remembered
the lengths her father would go to if it meant
helping another person. V

“If you asked him a question and he didn’t
know the answer to it, he would go out of his
way and do his best to help you out.”

Metzger began teaching at Pittas an adjunct
professor in the Department of Mechanical En-
gineering and Materials Science inthe Swanson
School of Engineering in 2007, and became the

director of the Nuclear Engineering certiﬁcate .

program in 2010.

His colleague, Danielle Ilchuk, adrninistra—
tive coordinator for the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Center for Energy, called Metzger’s
time as director “a short time -to make a huge
impact.” Ilchuk worked with Metzger on de-

veloping the Nuclear Engineering program

through research facilitation.
“Enrollment for the Nuclear Engineering
Program just keeps going up, and John was

the reason. He just went above and beyond '

in everything he did. We will never be able to
replace john. We may hire someone else, but
there will never be anotherjohn,” Ilchuk said.

Metzger'himself came to the University

, setting from the nuclear industry. Prior to ob-

taining his position at Pitt, he worked at Bettis
Atomic Power Laboratory, after moving to
Pittsburgh in 2005.

“He had a varied career working in industry
and academia,” Holder said.

Ed McCord, the director of the Dick Thom-
burgh Forum for Law and Policy, and Kim Car-
son, the administrator of the forum, worked
closely with Metzger to develop the Symposium
on the Future of Nuclear Power that took place
last March. The symposium occurred on the
anniversaries of the Three Mile Island nuclear
accident and shortly after the anniversary of
the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accidents.

“It was his symposium, his accomplish-
ment,” McCord said. .

The symposium needed an expert on the
technology of nuclear power, and the organiz-
ers turned to Metzger. The symposium hosted
a total of 27 representatives from around the

country, Germany andjapan.

- ‘john enthusiastically got on board,” Mc-
Cord said. “All voluntarily, of course. Every-
thing to him was can—do with a big smile, all
the time. I’ve never met anyone who was such
a joy to work with.”

Carson agreed, stating, “It seemed like any-
thing I thought was a stumbling block, he had
a way to overcome it. He never made it seem

like he was too busy to help us, even though ‘

he was as busy as the next person  He always
made time for us.”

Rita Patel, a graduate student in Pitt’s nu-
clear engineering certiﬁcate program, encoun-
tered Dr. Metzger often. Aftertakingarequired
course with him in the fall of her junior year,
Patel continued taking classes speciﬁcally to
be taught by Metzger. She stressed Metzger’s
personal connection with students and his
entertaining teaching style.

“He wanted to getto know his students.
Even though it was a big class, he would try to
remember everyone’s names, and it was funny
because he never could. He would make fun of
himselffor not remembering,” she said.

Metzger even helped Patel obtain a fellow-
ship from thelNuclear Energy University Pro-
grams of the U.S. Department of Energy after
her senior year.:According to an article written
last summer in The Pitt News, Patel received an
annual $50,000 a year stipend over the next
three years as apart of the U.S. Department of
Energy’s Nuclear Engineering Program.

Patel said this funding would_go toward
her research of the oxidation of metal alloys.

“He would always try to help and encourage
you,” Patel said. I

Hillman laptop thefts spike in month of October

Mandy Velez
For The Pitt News

Sara Turner, a senior majoring in natural sci-
ences, left her laptop at atable on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
of the Hillman Library while she went to grab
a drink from the Cup and Chaucer Cafe. She
didn’t think leaving it would be problematic,
considering the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Hillman was heav-
ily populated and she was only leaving it for
ﬁve minutes.
She was wrong.
When Turner returned to her table, she saw
a man wearing jeans and a black sweatshirt
with the hood up walking away. He carried
no backpack, just a laptop case with a handle.

An unsuspecting 'I'urner thought the scene
seemed odd, but let it go —- until she saw her
laptop was missing.

She turned around and from across the
room shouted to the hooded man.

“Hey, what’s in your briefcase?” Turner
asked.

The man continued his rapid pace despite
her protests until she asked him to open the
case he held. He complied, opening the case
to reveal 'I‘umer’s laptop.

Turner took her laptop back and went to ﬁle
a report. The library called the Pitt police, and
although they searched the area, the unknown
man scurried away.

“I’ve [left my laptop and] gone to Panera
before,” Turner said. “I guess this was kind of
a reality check.”

While studying in the Hillman Library,
many students leave their belongings, includ-
ing laptops, unattended. This month, at least
10 laptops have been stolen in the Hillman,
according to Pitt Police Blotter. Two of these
thefts occured this past Tuesday. In compari-
son, only two thefts occurred in Hillman dur-
ing the entire month of September, according
to the blotter. .

Turner said the laptops thefts surprise her.

“I want to think we’re all here to learn and
mutually respect each other,” she said.

University of Pittsburgh police detective
Kathleen Gaus said that laptop thefts are in-
cluded amongthe smaller belongingtheﬁs that
the Pitt police investigate. Solving laptop thefts

requires a similar tracking process to those in

place for most lost or stolen electronics.
“Once we get info we have to have a serial

number,” Gaus said. “We check local pawn

shops and [the serial number] goes through
the computer until it’ll get a hit.”
Gaus said that the Pitt police also check

with the manufacturer in case the laptop was -

sent back after being sold on the street. There’s
a good chance the police can ﬁnd stolen lap-
tops back at the manufacturer because thieves
selling the laptops can’t always break pass-
words or delete all the settings before they sell
them. The Pitt police also check the burglary

unit within the Pitt police in case people return 7

the stolen laptops there.

While its serial number remains a crucial
factor in tracking a laptop, Gaus advises stu-
dents to never leave their belongings unat-
tended for any amount of time.

“It takes less than a minute,” Gaus said, ad-
vising students to take their laptop with them
if they have to leave their table. “It’s the simple
things that stop the crime from happening.”

Even with these warnings, students study-
ing in Hillman still leave their laptops unat-
tended. During an informal survey of the ﬁrst
ﬂoor the week of Oct. 15, four laptops appeared
to be unattended.

Marina Lukac, a visiting Lake Erie College
of Osteopathic Medicine student and recent

Pitt grad, left her MacBook alone for 38 min-
utes while she took a phone call. ‘

“I didn’t think it was that big of a deal,” she
said of the incident.  W

Occasionally, she would pop in to make sure
nobody took her things. She also has her serial
number written down along with a program
named Lojack that has the capability to track a
laptop _in the-case that it becomes lost or stolen.

“I’d probably ask someone to watch it if I
went to the bathroom,” Lukac said.

Even Turner, after watching someone steal
her laptop, said she wouldn’t handle the situ-
ation that much differently. ‘

“I’m a little more cautious,” Turner said.

“[But] I still just ask people [to watch it] .”
A Pitt police commander Shawn Ellies said
to report any suspicious activity to the Pitt
police and also recommended tips to help
prevent laptop theft.

“Don’t leave your laptop unattended,” Ellies
said. “Take it with you, or put it in the hands
of other students.”

Turner said she realizes she was lucky to
have gotten her laptop back.

“Ten more seconds and it would have been
gone,” she said. I W

Take calculated risks to make

your life more exciting

Channing Kaiser
For The Pitt News

Some might call Felix Baumgartner
crazy.

Baumgartner jumped from a cap-
sule more than 126,000 feet above
Earth, reaching speeds of more than
833 miles per hour and free-falling
for 4 minutes and 19 seconds. He
shattered the records for highest
parachute jump and largest manned
balloon ﬂight, and he was the ﬁrst
man to break the sound barrier
outside of a vehicle. But fortunately,
he didn’t break a bone in his body,
which was a genuine risk if his brak-
ing parachute didn’t deploy.

“Where some say ‘crazy,’ I say
‘awesome,”’ Baumgartner said.

I wouldn’t consider this an act of
youthful spontaneity (better known
as “recklessness”). I

First off, Baumgartner is 43.
That’s middle-aged — also known as

“old.” Baumgartner just chooses not H. ~

to worry about old-people problems,
like taxes and moody teenage sons
or daughters who look like Skrillex;
He prefers to worry about his lungs
bursting and his blood literally boil-
ing from low air pressure.

« Secondly, nothing about this
venture is spontaneous.7NASA had
its eyes trained on Baumgartner be-

cause he was the perfect test dummy V

for spacesuits, and NASA usually has
pretty good eyes — although they’re
a little distracted at the moment,
because the rover Curiosity found
something shiny on Mars.

e Baumgartner also had a 550-

foot balloon to take him up into ,

the stratosphere. Things like that

nights when your buddy says, “Dude,
Hemingway’s is closed. What should
we do?” The results of that question
are usually a less-than-sparkling toi-
let and regrettable Facebook photos.

Baumgartner took a calculated
risk, something I think we should all
do more often in our lives. He went
out of his comfort zone — into the
death zone, actually — and took one

literally giant leap. . I

The riskiest thingl did  
* at you as if you just pushed Regina

weekend was investigate and then
scrub off the foreign brown stains
that were splattered on my kitchen
ceiling. '

Not very risky.

With free cable and Wi-Fi, pre-
made food at dining halls and no
real—life obligations (let’s be hon-
est, college is not real life), it is easy
to get comfortable. We make things .

likebucketlists and stupidbetswith ’

friends as an excuse to do something

risky. We sometimes drink because

it’s easier to tell a guythat he’s}ho'for3

endlessly fascinating or looks" great *
in his World of Warcraft shirt with ’

a Solo cup in our hands than it is to
tell him in the daylight.

If you want, you could say,
“YOLO.” But I’m not promoting it in
the do-an-alcohol-enema sense of
the word. Remember‘? Calculated
risk. Don’t jump out of a capsule
126,000 feet above the ground un-
less you have a 550-foot balloon and
NASA on your side. I’m using YOLO
as in the make-your-life-as-awe-
some-as-possible sense of the word.

Don’t know where to start?

Here are some ideas: ‘~ :

1. Skydiving. The ﬁrst time you go

you’re attached to an experienced in- .

 

stuff for you. All you have to do is try
not to vomit.

V 2. Talk to someone you’ve always
wanted to talk to but haven’t. The guy
who makes You'I‘ube videos that you
not-so-secretly watch, the friendly
barista at Common Grounds — any-
one will do. Best-case scenario: You
make a new friend or just have a re-
ally awesome conversation. Worst-
case scenario: You survive ‘an;'awk-
ward moment of someone—stalrii1g

George in front of a bus, and then
get over it.

3. Sign up to be one of the people
with an axe wedged in his head at a
haunted house. 'I‘hat’d look awesome
on your resume.

4. Go to Anthrocon. Anthrocon is
the armual furry convention held in

, Pittsburgh every summer. For those
‘L of you who haven’t seen the “My
' Strange Addiction” furrypepisode,
* ﬁirries are people who:~like.%’t;ov:dress
;‘_-"up in  costumes (réferredsto
 their “fursonas”)  role-‘play,

both online and offline. It’_slike Sims,
except with giant mammals and a lot
more dudes (according to Wikipedia,
80 percent of ﬁirries are males). If
you’re a single lady looking for some
love, I think you found your place.

5. None of these ideas are quite as
spectacular as Felix Baumgartner’s
feat, but you’re still young and hip
and have plenty of time to build up to
something that magniﬁcent. Besides,
I heard it takes a long time to build
a stratosphere-worthy balloon out
of homecoming queen T-shirts and
dirty frat togas. You should probably
get started. I

FOOTBALL

Tyler Pecyna
Sta_}j" Wrz'ter

Members of the Big East voted Temple out
of the conference in 2004. But this season,
the Owls were welcomed back to ﬁll the void
West Virginia left when the Mountaineers
departed for the Big 12.

And so far Temple has madethe most
of its return, winning two of its ﬁrst three
conference games this season.

With the Pitt football team hoping to
earn its ﬁrst conference win of the season,‘
the Panthers (34, 0-3 Big East) will renew
their in-state football rivalry with the Owls
(3-3, 2-1 Big East) this Saturday at Heinz
Field. The noon kickoff will be televised
on WTAE—TV in Pittsburgh via the Big East
Network, and the game can be found online
at WatchESPN.com.

Pitt may own an impressive 26-8-1 all-
time record against its rival from Philadel-
phia, but this isn’t the same Temple team
that Pitt consistently dominated in the Owls’
previous stint in the Big East.

During its eight-year conference hiatus,
Temple has steadily improved, earning trips
to two bowl games in the past three years.
And in their ﬁrst year back in the Big East,
the Owls have experienced mild success —
especially considering their last-place rank-
ing in the preseason media poll.

“I’m not surprised by [Temple’s suc-
cess],” Pitt head coach Paul Chryst said in
his weekly press conference. “They were a
good football team last year and have been
for a number of years now. I’m not surprised
one bit by [the success].”

SPORTS

Seeking ﬁrst Big East Win, Pitt renews rivalry with in-state foe

After a sloppy victory against Buffalo last
weekend that ended Pitt’s two-game losing
streak, Chryst and the Panthers will look to
climb back to a .500 record with a victory
over the Owls.

The Panthers and Owls have had similar
results this season. Not only do both teams
share a goal of keeping postseason hopes
from sputtering, but they also share similar
styles of play.

“I think [these are] two teams probably
not terribly, terribly far apart from each
other,” Temple head coach Steve Addazio
said in a press conference. “Both want to
run the ball, bothwlant tothrow play-action,
both want to try to stop the run. So you’re
going to see that.”

Temple has already compiled a pair of Big
East wins, defeating Connecticut and South
Florida. Last week, it led undefeated No. 15
Rutgers at halftime. The Owls’ defense held
Rutgers scoreless on just 110 yards of total
offense in the ﬁrst half before surrendering
35 unanswered in the second, losing the
contest 35-10.

After watching Rutgers quarterback Gary
Nova pass for four touchdowns in the second
half against Temple, Pitt quarterback Tino
Sunseri, who attempted only 17 passes last
Saturday, will be hoping to have a successful
afternoon. The potential return of senior
Hubie Graham at the tight end position
could add another weapon to Pitt’s already
strong receiving core. Graham missed the
last two games with a high ankle sprain.

Chryst said that he also wants his incon-
sistent running squad to have a big game.

“There have been times where it’s been

3 good and times where it kind of eroded a

bit,” the ﬁrst-year head coach said.

Pitt running backs Ray Graham and
Rushel Shell, who both scored touchdowns
against Buffalo, will hope to please their
coach by torching the conference’s second-
worst run defense.

Defensively, the Panthers will face the Big
East’s worst passing offense, quarterbacked
by junior Chris Coyer. Coyer has averaged a
putrid 121.2 pass yards per game and is the
only quarterback in the conference with at
least 100 pass attempts who has not eclipsed
1,000 yards this season.

Temple’s offensive success is carried by
its established ground game. The Owls av-
erage 167.2 rush yards per game, which is
the second-best mark in the Big East, and
they’ve tallied nine rushing touchdowns
through six games. The attack is led by ﬁfth-
year senior running back Montel Harris
— a transfer from Boston College — who
leads the team with4391 yards and three
touchdowns.

In Temple’s three wins this year, the Owls
accumulated eight total rushing touchdowns
and surpassed the 200-yard rushing mark
each game.

With both teams looking to run the ball
and play solid defense, the crucial confer-
ence clash could come down to a kicking
battle, which is just ﬁne with Pitt senior
kicker Kevin Harper.

After struggling early in the season,
Harper returned to his usual form at Buf-
falo, drilling both ﬁeld goals he attempted,
despite kicking into strong wind and rain.

“It’s. deﬁnitely a big conﬁdence builder
hitting two big ﬁeld goals and [now] getting
ready for an in-state rivalry,” Harper said.

Students stack up to grab free early-mo

Cathy Butchy
Mcmaging Editor

It’s a common truism that college
students love getting free food.

But take a walk down Oakland
Avenue on an early Friday morning,
and you’ll discover something less
well-known: They also like provid-
ing it. I

Well, four Carnegie Mellon ju-
niors do at least. Every Friday at
8:30 a.m., the residents of 339 Oak-
land Ave. rise early forfone purpose
—~ to cook breakfast on their front
lawn and distribute it to passersby.
The mealof c_h_oice?‘Pancjak,es.

With  ofﬁcial-jcatchphrase T
“hot and free,‘ like America in the "

puter engineering majors Jim Hart,
Adam Britton, Chad Miller and
Danny Santoro host Free Pancake
Friday, a free-food phenomenon
that began spontaneously in early

September and has been serving ‘

up hot and fresh breakfast joy —
and some confusion —— ever since.
Now in its eighth week, Free Pan-
cake Friday has already become a
weekly stop for some South Oakland
commuters on their way to class.
For others, it continues to provide
a strange and wonderful bit of early-
morning serendipity.

Although their method might
seem unorthodox —— they’ll admit
that it is + to many stressed col-

summertime,” electrical and.com- 7

legians rushing to class, the CMU
students’ unabashed generosity
provides a bright moment of whole-
some, laidback enjoyment during
the otherwise hectic school week.
And for the cooks, that’s the
goal. Santoro and Miller summed
it up. ,
“We like giving people free stuff.”
“It’s really enjoyable.”

The breakfast engineers

While their quirky breakfast-
themed altruism might now set
them apart, Hart, Britton, Miller
and Santoro’s pre—pancake story
is one many college students can
relate to. The four lived in the same
dormitory their freshman year and,
after meeting on the CMU football
team, got to know each other well
during six-day-a—week practices and
evenings spent gaming and gener-
ally hanging inltheir dorm rooms.

“We spent a lot of time in each
others’ dorms, studying, just hang-
ing around,” Miller said.

Although busy schedules caused
Britton and Miller to leave the foot-
ball team, the group stayed close,
continuing to sharetheir electrical
and computer engineering major.
and choosing to live together again
as sophomores.

For their junior year, the friends
decided to move to South Oakland,

students live in Shadyside or Squir-
rel Hill.

As it has for many college stu-
dents, sharing meals has played a
continual role in bolstering the Free
Pancake Friday group’s friendship.
The group used to keep a tradition
called “Midnight Meat,” a weekly
event held on Thursdays that, al-
though kept private, provided a sort
of prototype to the shared Friday-
morning pancakes. ‘

“Every Thursday night, we used
to make a lot of meat on the grill,”
Santoro said. “Actually, it’s kind of
like we moved Midnight Meat to
Friday morning, with pancakes.”

Whether they’re cooking, pre-
paring for a test or just chatting
around a table, what the four seem
to enjoy most is each others’ com-—
pany. Joking and laughing good-
naturedly as they cooked a special
batch of lunchtime pancakes one
Thursday afternoon, the friends dis-
cussed everything from electrical
circuitry to football to what ﬂavor
to make next week’s pancakes.

Although the purpose of Free
Pancake Friday seems sincerely to
be simple goodwill and enjoyment,
the roommates also started putting
out a donation jar in early Septem-

ber to raise money for a cause. Last‘

month, they raised $65 for a local
food bank. In October, they’re on

Alcohol and pizza are a college tra-
dition. The options are served at
several places in the area, and two
local business owners have realized
the potential of combining them.
Papa Da Vinci, located on the
Boulevard of the Allies, and Pizza
Sola, on'Atwood Street, have both
recently chosen to add beer and
liquor to their menus in an attempt
to attract more customers.
, Papa Da Vinci, since its open-
ing in November 2009, has made

a name for itself primarily with its,

pizza and hoagies. The food is still
selling, now with the aid of a new
"bar installed this past summer.
Owner Bayram O. Kan, a native of
-Turkey and a Duquesne University

graduate, said plans for the bar had
been in the works since early on in
the restaurant’s existence.

“Since day one, when the kids
started coming here, they were
asking for liquor and beer,” Kan
said. “They knew it was coming
before I knew it.”

Zach Glave, who cooks at Papa _
Da Vinci, has seen business pick" . 3

up signiﬁcantly since the start of
school. ’

“The past two weekends, we’ve »
hit 390, almost 400 checks:in a

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

A slice of nothingness

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

Think about the generic birthday
party of an 8-year-old. Next to the
dozens of balloons and uncomfort-
able, pointy party hats, the most
quintessential aspect is probably the
dessert: cake.

Children go crazy for it. Their lips
are dyed blue with the icing; they ﬁght
over the biggest corner piece. Even
babies feel compelled to stick the en-
tirety of their hands into their ﬁrst
birthday cakes. '

It’s time to make cake a part of
our history, not our present. When
cake is the most boring of the plethora

‘ of possible desserts, why settle for

something so generic?

The flavor of cake is the most un-
sophisticated and lackluster experi-
ence your taste budswill ever encoun-
ter. The most popular ﬂavors when
you go to order one of these from the
bakery include chocolate, of course.
But then there’s the option of white
or yellow. ‘

White and yellow? These are col-
ors, not ﬂavors. Please tell me what
white tastes like. It sounds like it
rnightbe bland. Then again, maybe it
isn’t. White couldbe smooth, creamy
and sweet. Is yellow something sour
or citrusy? Spoiler alert: they both

taste like absolutely nothing. They
are ﬂavorless.

Sometimes cake consumers will
try to get fancy with something like
red velvet cake. Red velvet, to me,
sounds less like an elegant dessert
and more like an antique upholstery
choice. The only difference I see be-
tween red velvet and any other cake is
the unfortunate stain the red food col-
oringwill leave. Nothing fancy here.

Another factor that adds to cake’s

childish appeal is the butter and sugar '

mixture that goes on top: the dreaded
icing. Sure, icing makes the cake look
pretty. With all those fancy ﬂowers
alongside the piped “Happy Birth-
day!” script, you’ve made a stellar-
looking centerpiece for the table.

Icing is like the ominous violin
music to this nightmarish _dessert
scene. As if the cake alone weren’t a
bunch of empty calories, we have to
go the extra step to ﬁirther clog our
arteries. Icing doesn’t have much of
a ﬂavor to it either, unless “sugar”
counts.

This was the one opportunity we
had to make abland cake taste better.
It seems like we’ve dropped the ball
again: A frosted cake is just like eat-
ing sugar-ﬂavored caloric air. Where’s
the substance? It might not seem like
you’re eating a ton of food, but the

sugar-induced coma at the last bite
should be enough of a deterrent. ‘

Cake doesn’t even have an appeal-
ing texture. It ranges from light and
airy to very dense. And then the icing
steps in. Piled high atop the cake, usu-
ally between the layers as well, icing
and cake combine to create a tex-
ture disaster. A dense cake weighing
heavily on your fork, foam-like icing
clumped on top, staining your plate:
These are two textural extremes that
should never be combined. ‘

It’s time to consider our alterna-
tives. We should level up to a more
interesting dessert: a key lime pie
or creme brulee perhaps. These are
totally feasible additions to your din-
ner party dessert repertoire. All you
need is abunch gflimes and a kitchen
torch. . ~

Wait a minute.

OK, maybe these fancier desserts
are a little more complicated than
the generic butter, eggs, ﬂour, sugar
combination that eventually becomes
cake. Isn’t there something else that
has similar ingredients though?

Yes! And it’s the most versatile
dessert or snackin the world: cookies.

Cookies might be a kid favorite

too, but they have everything that

cake lacks.
Cookies are versatile. They can be

as bland or as exciting as the baker
intends, depending on who will be
eating them. Kids can enjoy a simple
sugar cookie, which can transform
into a more interesting treat with
the addition of only one or two in-
gredients.

For example, there are chocolate
chip cookies —- a classic choice, but
perhaps alittle tired. Make them oat-
meal chocolate chip cookies. It’s an
easy alteration. A completely differ-
ent experience, ‘plus a more satisfy-
ing and ﬁlling texture, a quality that
cakes lack. _

Baking cookies might be a bit
more time consuming if made from
scratch, as youwillundoubtedly have

This colorfui ak is anthin but ppetiing. Kenny Ong |Viua| t

 Cut cake from desse tions

  
   

several cookie sheets worth of dough.
But you can enjoy them as you go,
seeing as they are ready to eat after
just ﬁve minutes of cooling. A‘ cake
requires a longer effort. The entire
cake must cool for approximately
an eternitybefore you ruin it further
with the icing.

So when you’re faced with a des-
sert decision, consider these options.
A slice of boring or a classic, hand-

held,,milk—dunkable,ﬁ1ll-of-variat1'on ,

gift from the gods. Well, if you’re out
to eat and someone else is paying,
maybe go for that creme brulee. I

Pittsburgh neighborhoods provide distinct flavors to diners

Matthew Schreiber
Social Media Editor

Each of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods
has its own distinct personality, so
it’s only natural that the city’s res-
taurants are as diverse as the area
that they are located in. Grab that
shiny Pitt ID from your wallet and
take advantage of those always-en-
tertaining city buses to get outside
of our lovely Oakland campus and

grab some great food all around the

Steel City.

After three years spent as a stu-
dent in Pittsburgh, I’ve come up
with the following list of suggested
restaurants (organized by neigh-

borhood) that’s sure to satisfy what— ,

ever type of food you’re craving:

Shadyside

More than just great shopping,
Shadyside offers some excellent
(though fairly pricey) food options.
Looking for a foodie’s take on Ital-
ian? Check out Girasole -and try
the pumpkin ravioli. Want to know
what gourmet fried rice tastes like?
Then you must try uber—trendy
Soba, owned by the same people
who help to craft your burrito over

at Mad Mex.

Speaking of which, Shadyside’s
Mad Mex could not be more dif-
ferent than its sibling in South
Oakland. With great decor and a
somewhat upscale atmosphere, it
makes for a perfect date-night spot.
Another Shadyside favorite is Shady
Grove, where sandwiches and sal-
ads are consistently fresh and tasty.
The lunch menu is fairly extensive,
and the restaurant’s ambience
makes it a nice place to hang out.
Duringthe warmerweather months
you can also sit outside.

Lawrenceville

Easily my favorite neighborhood
in the city, artsy and pseudo-hipster
Lawrenceville has some ‘very af-
fordable and creative dining op-
tions. Skip this weekend’s brunch
‘at Forbes Avenue’s Pamela’s and

head over to Coca Cafe for some
truly original breakfast food op-
tions. With offerings such as pump-
kin pancakes, goat-cheese-stuffed
french toast and lobster benedict,
you won’t be disappointed. The best
part? Most menu items are under
$10.

Other trendy and mouth-water-

ing dishes can be found at Spanish-

’ Asian—fusion-themed (you read that

correctly) Tamari, where you can
order authentic paella with some
fresh sushi as an appetizer.

South Side _

Yes, we all know that you’ve
eaten at every conceivable restau-
rant in South Side Works after go-
ing to Forever 21, Urban Outfitters
and H&M. While they are all viable
choices, the Works offers some of
the most basic dining options that
the South Side has to offer.

Take a walk down Carson Street
and check out Lin’s Asian Fusion for
some delicious (and ridiculously
cheap) Chinese food. The restau-
rant’s fried wontons would seri-
ously say, “I’m perfect,” if they had
the capability to do so. You’ve got
to try them. Lin’s is also happy to
deliver to your apartment or dorm
if you order over the phone. Nearby
Fat Head’s offers fantastic bar-style
food. Be warned, though, that waits

_ for tables can exceed an hour if you

don’t call ahead.
. East Liberty ‘
Let mepreface this by saying

that there is —— for better or worse '

— nothing like Sorrento’s pizza
(with ranch, obviously) at 2 a.m.
down on Atwood Street. With that
said, Dinette offers some of the
most stellar pizza available in all of
Pittsburgh. Something unique: Di-
nette is one of the few BYOB restau-
rants in town. They have a menu of
personal pizzas that changes slight-
ly from day to day in accordance

with what seasonal ingredients are _

available. The chorizo pizza (topped
with potatoes, fresh onions and to-
die-for mozzarella) is a standout on
an all-around delicious menu.

Have you been to BRGR be-
fore? They offer hamburgers like
you’ve never tasted. Made from
high—quality beef, the burgers range
from the typical Kobe beef burger to
the exotic kamikaze burger (made
of ahi tuna and topped with soy
sauce, chili aioli and tempura). The
strange—sounding fried pickle side
dish is something worth trying. The
drink menu is asolid one for those
of legal drinking age. -The spiked
milkshakes (try the salty caramel
one and thank me later) really com-
plement all of the burgers well.

Other neighborhoods

While many of the restaurants
situated Downtown are fairly ex-
pensive, there are still several choic-

es that are affordable. Inthe heart ’

of Point Park’s campus is Nathan’s
Famous, which serves fantastic
old-fashioned hot dogs. In nearby
beautiful Market Square, NOLA on
the Square has New Orleans—style
fare that is sure to satisfy anyone’s
craving for something spicy. Their
seafood ljambalaya is the best that
the city has to offer.

If you’re spending a weekend
morning in the Strip District, you
should make sure to have lunch at
Kaya. The “island cuisine” may be
a bit too exotic for some diners, but
the signature Kaya burger is unlike
anything that you’ve eaten before
— it’s topped with avocado, bacon,
a sunny-side up egg and special
“Kaya sauce.” So. Good.

Take my advice and venture out-
side of Oakland and sample some of
the cuisine in each of Pittsburgh’s
eclectic neighborhoods. With each

’ area offering unique options, there’s

truly something for everyone. I
promise that you won’t be disap-
pointed! I

their way to a higher amount — this time
for a different cause.

“Our football coach at CMU, his wife
passed away from breast cancer at the begin-
ning of the season. So for October we’re col-
lecting for breast cancer research, and we’re
going to donate it in her name,” Santoro said.

CMU football head coach Rich Lackner
said that while his late wife, Cindy, didn’t
often interact directly with the team mem-
bers, they all knew her because of her victory
tradition.

“My wife, when we would win, she would
always bake the boys cookies on Sunday and

724-742~BEEF 

Monday for Tuesday’s practice,” Lackner
said, pointing out that the 10 dozen cook-
ies needed to satisfy the team of 101 play-
ers would keep his wife baking for two days
straight.

The head coach wasn’t surprised when he
heard of the men’s decision to bring a shared
meal to their neighborhood while collecting
for a cause.

“All four are great young men,” Lackner
said. ‘_‘Great, great kids  I think this is their
way of doing something wonderful for people,
of giving back to the community.”

The giveaway

While Santoro now serves as Free Pancake
Friday’s head cook, the weekly event started

   

412-362~BIl{EF:

with an idea of Miller’s.

Finding himself inspired one early Sep-
tember morning, Miller had entered the
compact kitchen to make a sizable break-
fast. Forty—some buckwheat pancakes later,
and he had more than he and his roommates
could eat.

“I just made the entire box of pancake mix.
I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll just make it all,’ and it was
way too many,” Miller said.

1 Rather than throw away the surplus ﬂap-
jacks, the house members decided to see if
any of their fellow Oakland dwellers would
be interested in sharing. Perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, they were. .

“It was pretty crude. They were just regu-
lar buckwheat pancakes that we were handing
people, and they were taking them with their

hand,” Santoro explained. “It took like 15
minutes for someone to take one, but after the
ﬁrst girl took one, like the next 10 people did.”

“So we were like, man, this would be awe-
some if we did this every week. So we made
a Twitter and grabbed a grill.”

Hart chimed in: “I do not ﬁilly understand
the motivation behind it.”

Neither did Free Pancake Fridays patrons
— at least not at ﬁrst. Santoro said that dur-
ing the ﬁrst week of Free Pancake Friday three
people asked if the pancakes were poisoned,
and three others asked if they were rooﬁed.

“Originally people liked to kind of see us
and maybe cross over to the other side of the
street,” Britton said. ,

Miller agreed. “We know when we’re giv-

ing out free pancakes, just asking people to

take our pancakes, we’re going to get some
weird looks,” he said.

Their pancakes, of course, are drug—free
and don’t include any add—ins other than the
occasional dose of M&M’s or peanut butter
and chocolate chips, but the engineers can
understand the suspicion.

After more than a month of consistent
pancake giveaways, however, they’ve come
up with a few strategies for making potential

ing, butmanager Ben Emata said a full bar
was being planned for some time.

“It seemed like we weren’t using the liquor
license to its full potential,” Emata said.

Emata said Sola’s prices have remained
consistent the past three years he’s worked
there, and the beer is competitively priced,
especially compared to the six—pack stores
in the area. .

“The perception in Oakland was that Pizza
Sola is more expensive. Now it seems like,’
for what you get, it’s cheaper,” said Emata.

Other pizza shops in the area choose not
to serve alcohol and instead relyon the busi-
ness that nearby bars often provide the
with. ’

Pizza Romano, a pizzeria located adjacent
to Garage Door Saloon, takes orders from
customers from a window within the bar.

“We have enough drunk customers as is,”
said Burak Budak, manager of Pizza Romano.
“Our reputation is with pizza, and that’s ﬁne.”

Budak could not comment on how many
orders come from the bar.

Likewise, Larry and Carol’s, located on
Semple Street, has been the beneﬁciary of a
closely located bar: the newly renovated and
student-friendly Bootlegger’s. \

Shadi Aboud, co—owner of Larry and
Carol’s, said business is doing just ﬁne and
has even picked up a little bit so far this year.

“It’s three key ingredients to being suc-
cessful: The customers, the employees and
yourself have to be happy. You have to keep
everyone happy,” said Kan.

Since happiness for a college student usu-
ally comes in the form of pizza and beer, Kan
might just be on to something here. I

visitors more comfortable. In addition to
getting paper plates and plastic forks for less
adventurous eaters, the group realized that
a female presence made the pancakes seem
less suspect. Occasionally Santoro will have
a few of his female high school friends come
over to populate the area, and the result is a
more approachable setting.

“Too bad we go to CMU, and we’re engi-
neers,” Hart said.

“We know a couple girls,” Britton coun-
tered. “Probably less than ﬁve.”

But the four are conﬁdent they can en-
courage community engagement nonethe-
less. _

“We even set out a table, that if anyone
wants to sit down, they can sit down,” Miller
said. “Enjoy some conversation.”

Whether it’s the comfort of added sup-
plies, the group’s lively @CMUPancakes Twit-

V ter proclaiming the beneﬁts of free pancakes

.— “We’ve been told they cure hangovers,”
Britton said —— or simply word of mouth,
Free Pancake Friday’s popularity is growing.
Two weeks ago, the giveaway had a small line,
despite cold and rainy weather.

“We’re a pretty legit operation,” ‘Britton

_ said.

The takeaway

On the sunny and only slightly chilly
morning of Oct. 19, Week 7 of Free Pancake
Friday, Santoro manned the griddle while
Hart kept ready pancakes warm, enclosing
them in between two pans to await the ‘next
class-time rush.

Although Britton and Miller were away for

Carnegie Mellon’s mid—semester break, they

likely wouldn’t have been by the house even if -

they were in Pittsburgh. A few weeks ago, the
group instituted a new pancake delivery ser-
vice, which involves the two running through
the neighborhood’s streets with plates of the
pancakes to distribute. Other than widening
their dispersal area, their goal is to reach
Atwood Street, where they’ll usually ﬁnd a
homeless man to whom they give the few
remaining pancakes.

Out front of 339 Oakland Ave., a large,

tarp-like banner, hand painted in forest-
green lettering with the message “Free Pan-
cakes — from your friendly neighborhood
CMU house,” welcomed hurried students to
stop on their way to class and grab a bite to
eat. Santoro did the same, calling, “free pan-
cakes!” at a volume audible for more than a

_ block in either direction as he ﬂipped freshly

poured pancakes. In the early morning air,
the sound forced walker after walker from
their sleep—like trances.

Hurrying toward Forbes Avenue, Pitt stu-
dent Danielle Narlesky was on her way to
open up shop at the Oakland Oasis tanning

salon where she works —— only she couldn’t

ﬁnd her keys. ' . .

i““Free Pancake Friday is the only good
part of this morning,” she said, grabbing a
pancake before continuing her speed walk

O toward Forbes Avenue.

Pitt seniorjohannajoseph was also glad to
ﬁnd the double—wide grill and accompanying
plastic table in the middle of a South Oakland

‘ lawn. In fact, she and her friend came out

speciﬁcally to ﬁnd it.

Having ﬁrst heard about the free pancakes
through @FreeFoodOakland, apopular Twit-
ter account meant to alert Oakland residents
to the presence. of complementary victuals
throughout the neighborhood, Joseph set
out to ﬁnd them for herself.

“I didn’t know if this was real,” she said,
as she prepared her breakfast with the syrup

the roommates keep on the lawn table.

Although the CMU students still get ques—_
tioning looks from some of those rushing
past, the number of people who stop to ask
about the event outnumbers those who cross
the street thesedays.

Although unseasonably warm weather has
allowedthe event to continue expanding, the
quickly approaching month of November will
force the CMU house to develop new strate-
gies for keeping their free outdoor pancakes
available to themasses.

They’re not concerned, however. When
asked what their plan was in case of snow,
Miller, Santoro and Britton were all in agree-
ment with Hart’s immediate reply.

“To make pancakes,” he said. I
