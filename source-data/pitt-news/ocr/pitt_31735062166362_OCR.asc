Players All-Male Cast To Show
War Comedy-Drama ‘Stalag 17’

By DWIGHT FONG x

Theater—goers will see an almost documentary drama.

about the harrowing yet grimly comic life of American air-
men in a World War II Nazi prisoner-of-war camp when the
Pitt Players present “Stalag l7” this week. i
The Edmund Trzcinski-Donald Bevan comedy—drama,
featuring an all-male cast, will be produced at Foster Me-

morial each evening Wednesdayd

through Saturday at 8:30 p.m.
with a Thursday matinee at 2 p.m.
for Engineering and Mine stu-
dents. .

The proceeds of the Wednes-
day performance will go to the
Pitt Chest. “This is the ﬁrst time
that the group has a beneﬁt per-
formance,” said Michael Mc-
Hale, director of the Players.

Ticket price is $1, with a spe-
cial rate for groups.

Tickets for the Wednesday show
can be obtained from Harriet
Laby, Pitt Chest special events
committee chairman, or from Jack
Hardman in the Dean of Men’s
Oﬁ’ice, 801 O1.

Based mainly on the authors’
actual experiences in a real
stalag in Austria, the action of
the drama centers on a group of “
captured American soldiers

tipped oh‘ to the camp com-
mandant by an agent planted
among them.

One airman is thought to be the
spy and is severe beaten by the
others because. he trades with the
Nazis.

The prisoners’, close conﬁne-
ment, the hunger for decent food
and women, the lack of news
from home,‘ and the betrayed
escape "plots are the elements
that generate the suspense of
the play.

But between the tense moments
an earthy humor relieves the
viewer. .

Cast in the leading role is
Bob Rosborough as‘ the mal-
content accused of spying. Nick
Belich, the leader with a soft‘
heart; Dave Stoz, the security"

Chance of Getting
Pitt Radio Station A
A” student radio station is
being considered for Pitt, ac-
cording to Edward Bernstein,
Col. ’58, president of Alpha Phi
Omega, service fraternity.
The project,’ headed by
Bernstein and Neil Goodman, BA
‘"59, is only in the inquiry stage.
Letters have been written to col-
leges having radio stations and
‘to the Federal Communications
Commission for information re-
garding the operation» of a station.
It has been .125 years since Pitt
last had a radio station. A one-
room station was set up in State
Hall in 1924 as a branch of
KDKA. It operated from October
to May of each year and sched-
uled lectures of a semi-popular
nature by faculty members and
guest speakers. It continued until
the early thirties when the De-
pression forced it to close.
Some of the lecturesrs featured

on the station were Carl Sand- .

burg, Clarence Darrow, and John
Erskine. The topics included; The
Role of Chemistry in Everyday
Life, Evolution and Heredity,
Developing a Pleasing Personal-
ity, American Foreign Policy,
Conversations with a Philosopher.
and Great English Story Tellers.

Following a, practice of twenty years, Pratt & Whitney.
Aircraft will again welcome a group of college p1'o- ’

coming summer months. 0 J ‘ A

Last year our “summer professors” represented col-

~ in such diverse ﬁelds as instrumentation and vibration,
combustion, compressible flow, and materials develop-’
ment. Despite the limited time available to these men,
2 ‘they made signiﬁcant contributions to our overall effort.

Though it was to be expected that both the com-
pany and the participating professors might benefit. di-
rectly from such a program, the sphere of inﬂuence
‘has been much broader. The many students who are .
taught by these professors during the college year are «-**\-
sharing the ultimate beneﬁts . . . proﬁting. from lectures
that are sparked by the kind of practical experience
that can be gained with a recognized industry leader

the plan .wh'i—.chi it hassev y-

‘nor channelized in the proper direction. T
Along with the present revampment of Men’s,
Council, -and“ the proposed reorganization of the
whole governmental structure, now being worked
on by the Student Congress evaluation committee,
it must be realized that the ﬁrst, andmost im-
portant step in obtaining good government must
be a complete acceptance of responsibility, and‘pro-
longed year round interest on the‘ part of all mem-

of contest on this earth, be it a
race between people, horses,
dogs, or what have you, there
-will be opinions as to the out-
come. ‘ ' A «

Hollywood, which continually
throughout the years attempts to
become more colossal than the
year before, shows this attitude
all through the voting for
nominees this ‘year. Look at the
top voting category, the “best
movie”,selection, and this can
be seen readily. ,

All five pictures nominated in
this category are high—cost,
technicolor, “big” pictures, with
the possible exception, of
“Friendly “ Persuasion.” This
fblksy—type movie. sucess/fully
shunned the
production which Hollywood has
fallen for in an attempt to woo
people away from their TV seats
and back into the movie theater.

But two of the highest "budget
pictures of the year, “The Ten
' and “Around
the’ World in 80 Days” are ex-
pected to wage the biggest battle
for the prized Oscars, but the
ﬁnal vote could easily tap any
one of the ﬁve pictures. This
corner gives a slight edge to
“Around the World in 80 Days”
to emerge as winner. '

right to do. But-» by looking at
the situation from a logical -point
of view, ‘Congress would ﬁnd
that no need really ‘exists for an
All-University Queen.

It is the veryfunrealistic per-
son who thinks that this Uni-
versity has one woman who
stands out above the rest in that
combination of features
wins a Queen’s_ contest. This
simple, well—known fact is one

of the reasons why so many dif- "
( ferent sources are used afor‘the
-elections of queens.

.Although the Festival Com-
mittee stands to gain if the Fes-
tival Queen contest were made
the top contest of the year, in
that more publicity would be-
fall the week, its members -— in
unanimity -- feel that a Festival
Queen is a Festival Queen and
should not serveas the reigning
queen of the University.

With this in mind, Congress
should accept the plan that re-
presentatives of the committee
in question present today. And
if need be, members of the rul-
ing body should, evolve another
motion that would supersede the
—current one which callfsforjrthe

FASTERQFASTER!

Pick up your paper every rriorning and what do you
read? “CRISIS IN HIGHER EDUCATION.” That’s what you
read. “ENROLLMENT SPIRALLING UPWARD - DESPERATE .
NEED FOR MORE CLASSROOMS, MORE TEACHERS.” But
classrooms, alas, do not spring up like mushrooms, nor
teachers like rﬁayflies. So whatamust we do while we
build more‘ classrooms, train more teachers? We must
get better use out of the classrooms and teachers we now
have. That’s what we must do. ,

This column, normally a vehicle of good-humored
foolery, of joy that wrinkled care derides, oflaughter
holding both his sides, will today forsake levity to ex-
amine the crisis in higher education. My sponsors, t-he
makers of Philip Morris Cigarettes, as bonnie a bunch
of tycoons as you will see in a month of Sundays, have
given cheerful consent to this departure. Oh, splendid
chaps they are, the makers of Philip Morris! Oh, darlin’
types‘they are, fond of home, mother, porridge, the Con-
stitution, and country ﬁddling! _Twinkly and engaging
they are, jaunty and sociable, roguish and Winsome, as

9 full of joy, as packed with pleasure, as brimming with

natural goodness, as loaded with felicity as the ciga-
rettes they bring you in two convenient sizes - regular
in the handy snap-open pack, and new long-size in a
crushproof ﬂip-top box - both available at moderate cost
from your favorite tobacconist. Light one now. Light
either end. N o’ﬁlter cigarette can make that statement.

Let us‘ then, with the gracious connivance of the

p makers of Philip Morris — Oh, splendid chaps! Oh, gra-
Hcious connivers! —take up the terribly vexing question

ofrhow we can turn out more graduates with campus
facilities as they now‘ exist. '

The answer can be given in one word’: sipepedupf Speed
up the educational process. Streamline courses. El1m1‘- ’
nate frills"? -Sharpen. Shorten. Quicken.

Following is a list of courses with suggested methods
to speed up each one. ' '

PHYSICS -"Eliminate slow neutrons.

PsYc_H LAB-——Tilt the mazes downhill. The white
mice willrun, much faster. , ‘
1 ENGINEERING-— Make slide rules half as long.

MUSIC ‘Change all tempo to allegro. (A collateral
beneﬁt to be gained from this suggestion is that once
you speed up waltz time, campus proms will all be over by
10 p.m. With students going homeso early, romance will
languish and marriage counselors can be transferred
to the buildings and grounds department. Also, housing
now used for married students cangbe returned to the
school of animal husbandry.)

ALGEBRA— If _“x” always equals 24, much time-con-
suming computation can be eliminated.

LAN(_;UAGEs — Teach all language courses in English.
Drums-my — Skip baby teeth. They fall out anyhow.
POETRY -— Amalgamate the classics.’ Like this:

Hail to thee, blithe spirit v
Shoot if you -“must this old gray head
You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog
Smiling the boy fell dead.

D

You see how simple it is? Perhaps you have some

speedup ideas of your own. If so, I’ll thank you to keep
-~ them to yourselves.

Peery, Johnson,
Schirf Win Titles
At EIWA Classic

B)’ CHRIS GILLOTTI

Traditional ‘‘luck of the Ir-
ish” evaded the Panther grap-
plers this Sat Patrick’s Eve
and instead enabled Penn
Stateto end the locals’ three-
year reign as Eastern Intercol-
l e g i a t e Wrestling Association
(EIWA) champions at ’University
Park Saturday night. —

Although Coach Rex Peery’s
wrestlers won as many individual
crowns as the Lions -— three --
the amazing performance of Les
Walters gave the Nittany Lions
the necessary points_ to top the
Pittsburghers.

Walters, the “cinderella man”
of the tourney, astounded the ex-
perts by going all the way to the
ﬁnals before losing out to Ron
Flemming of Franklin & Marsh-
all, 5-3. Not only was Walters un-
ranked, but even the highly par-
tisan Penn State fans, knowing
his 1-3 record, were expecting
him to lose in the first round.

Peery Takes Honors

Walter’s point total pushed the

Cats finished second with 6]. and
Lehigh third with 48.

A bright spot in the gloom of
defeat was Ed Peery’s winning
three trophies. Besides recap-
turing the 123-pound Eastern
crown from State’s Sid Nodland,
5-2, Peery also copped the Most
Valuable Wrestler award, which
goes to the» participant voted
most deserving by the coaches
of the league, and, as a ﬁtting
climax to his three years of.
tourney competition, was award-
ed the John Fletcher Memorial
trophy which is presented to the
wrestler who accumulates the
greatest number 01' points dur-
ing his tournament career. -

Prior to decisioning Nodland,
Peery pinned Chuck Hershey of
Franklin & Marshall and Artie
McCall of Temple, and outpointed
John Cummings of Brown, 6-0, in
the semi-ﬁnals. -

Schirf Extended

Dave Johnson, last year’s 157
pound titlist, successfully moved
up a weight and had a rather‘easy

time notching t h e 167-pound
crown. Johnson decisioned Tem-
ple's Ray Norton, 9-1, State’s

Bruce Gilmore, 6-1, and Rutgers’
Neal Lesher, ‘6-1, to reach the
ﬁnals where he downed Cornell’s
Steve Friedland, 8-1.

In the heavyweight class, Ron
Schirf completely dominated the
ﬁeld to capture his ﬁrst Eastern
championship. In the prelimin-
aries Schirf shut out Sam
Markle of’ State (8-0), showed

~ the “lights” to Jim Thompson of
Temple and .Frank Knipe of
Penn, and defeated Chuck
Pfrommer of Franklin & Marsh-
all in the semi-ﬁnals.

Tony Stremic of Navy gave
Schirf a little trouble in the ﬁrst
two periods of the -ﬁnal, but the
big, fast senior from Latrobe
proved too much for the Middie,
winning 5-3.

Bienkowski Third

In the 130-pound division Vic
DeFelice made it to~the ﬁnal
round, but lost to the defending
champion, tough Johnny Johnston

of State.

Ted Bienkowski, who dropped
one limit to wrestle at 137
pounds, was eliminated in the
semi-finals by John Pepe of
State who later went on to take
the title away from Lehigh’s Joe
Gratto. Bienkowski captured a
third, however, by edging
Brown’s Frank Smith in the
consolation.

A close 4-3 verdict by Nittany
Lion Dave Adams stopped Bob
Bubb in the 147-pound quarter-
ﬁnals. Like his teamate Johnston
in the 130-pound class, Adams
took the title with a close triumph
over another Lehigh grappler,
Rich Santoro.

Hamer of Lehigh, 7-0 in the ﬁnals.
The Blue and Gold did not

‘ division. Originally Coach . Peery

the Expanding Field 
of   Instrumentation  

 

Step into I

Automatic control, or automation, or data reduction are
all Instrumentation, and oﬂer some of the broadest and most
satisfying careers available to today’s engineers and scientists‘.

. Atomic energy, iron and steel, aircraft and automobiles,
chemicals and chinaware, petroleum and electric power are
only a few of the many industries which need instruments.
This needcreates permanent opportunities in many of our op-
erations, including research and development, product engi-
neering, industrial engineering, production, inspection, mar;
ket development and customer contacts.

K The products with which you would be concerned include
automatic, high-precision instruments for controlling, record-‘
ing and indicating temperature, chemical concentration, ra_di-’
ation phenomena, frequency -and load and many other con-
ditions. For heat-treaters we make furnaces and process
equipment. For the worker in science-—.-whether student or‘
researcher——we make both automatic and manual laboratory-
type instruments, with which you may already be familiar.

U The Company has. about 3000 people—-is one of the biggest
in its ﬁeld, yet is compact enough for you to be able to ‘.‘-follow
the score.” Its reputation for progressiveness -in industrial
relations, and for quality of product is world wide.

Wayne L. Besselman, our Coordinator of Technical Em-
ployment, will be on the campus on,,March 27, 1957 with infor- 1
mation which he will cordially share about our very modern
opportunities and rewards for engineers and scientists. Your
placement bureau will arrange an appointment with Mr.
Besselman, at your request.

Unfortunately, the Panther root-

keeping themselves in the game
with their excellent outside shots.

In the second half, the rambling
Nildcats moved ahead by a mar-

gapvhafnd tie the Kentuckians at
39-69 with 11:30 left in the game.

and make it stand the rest of

the way.

»Riser again was the top Pan-
ther hero as he held up the de-
fense and provided the oﬁense for
the locals. A capacity crowd of
12,300 fans gave Riser a vote of
approval for his driving lay-ups,
one hand push shots from the out-
side, and rebounding.

Riser was also top scorer for
both teams as hegpicked up a
total of 64 points in the two“
games. Twenty-twoof the points
were for fouls picked up on drive-
in lay-ups.

In closing out the season Riser

raised. his career total to 1160

points,, 15 shy of the ‘school rec-

ord set by Bob Labor with 1175.

Hennon was second in the Pan-
ther offense with 44 points for

both games while Jules Peguesi

had a combined total of 28 points.
