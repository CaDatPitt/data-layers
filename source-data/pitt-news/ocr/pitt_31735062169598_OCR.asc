Project Thought

ROTC ‘Discussion’ Tops Agenda

by DAVE KUHN S
Staff News Writer

The controversial subject of ROTC ac-
creditation, recently the source of much
heated debate on campus, will be the topic
under consideration at Project Thought’s
Friday evening student-faculty forum.
Featured speakers on theagenda of this
week’s informal gathering will include Dr.
Richard W. Cottam from the University’s
Department of Political Science, Dr: Sam
Hays, chairman of the History Department,
and Dr. Walter Ritenour of the Placement
Department. -

Tonight’s Project Thought session will

‘meet at 7 p.m. in the Venetian Room, SU.

. Project Thought spokesman Mike Fab-_
ricant" emphasized that “Project Thought‘
invites the entire ROTC Cadre, the stu-
dent body at large, and any other inter-
ested parties to attend the informal discus-
sion group on Friday.”

This week's discussion session is an-
other in the continuing series of informal
student-faculty forums. sponsored by Proj-
ect Thought in an effort to thwart student

apathy regarding the important issues af-.

fecting the University community. A sec-I
0nd, and equally important objective of the
project is to deformalize and improve stu-
dent-faculty relations.

tee members, “Our aim is to completely
eliminate the lecture, note-taking atmos-

phere of the classroom. Too often, because '

of the growing size of the University, pro-
fessors as well as students are stifled by:
the rigid formality of the large classroom
situation. We would like the professors
and the students to have an opportunity to

get to know each other as people rather  I

than just a figurehead and the mass.”

VSU Board Committeerrfan Jim Ranii
tersely assessed the situation saying,

“What we have on this campus is a failure _ l

to communicate.” “Come Friday,” added

Undeniably his own, Fran Mankiewicz talked about the po-
litical past, analyzed the political present, and praised the po-
litical future when he spoke Wednesday in the Union Ballroom.

Speaking critically and frankly, of President-elect Richard
Nixon, Mankiewicz described American “disgust” for the old
political ways. Mankiewicz pointed to new “political divisions”

which will be forming in the
country, and- said that both ma-

"jor parties will be looking to‘
" “non-political” candidates in the

near future.

“The public is tired of politi-
cians,” said Mankiewicz, press
secretary for assassinated Sena-
tor Robert F. Kennedy. “Over the
last two weeks of the past cam-
paign, they (the publiclwished it
was over. Apathy was present.”

Speaking of Mr. Nixon, Man-
kiewicz remarked that “for the
first time, a nominee did not
move party members or stir en-
thusiasm among Republican vot-
ers. ~

“A survey after most political
conventions usually finds about
40 per cent of the people feeling
that the wrong candidate wa.s
chosen to run, but as the cam-
paigh continues this percentage
goes down," he said.

“This happened with the Dem-
ocratic Party this year. The per-
centage went down to 25 or 20
per cent. But with the Republi-
can Party, this went up as much

IE

as seven per cent,” added Man-
kiewicz.

Mankiewicz noted also that
neither Mr. Nixon or Vice-Presi-
dent Humphrey aided the cam-
paigns of gubernatorial or con-
gressional candidates. “The
‘Goodship Nixon’ and. the ‘Good-
ship Humphrey’ pulled nothing
off the bay. Neither had coattail
strength,” he said.

Mr. Nixon’s narrow victory
margin in the Presidential elec-
tion wouldfbel one of the coun-
try’s bigger problems, according
to Mankiewicz.

“There’s is now a different di-
vision in this country,” he said.
“Humphrey won the East except
for one or two states. All the rest
went to Nixon, except for the
southern Wallace vote.”-

“It’s hard to say where he (Mr.
Nixon) won it,” continued Man-
kiewicz. “He could’ve lost it be-
cause the function of the Vice-
Presidential choice is to help the
ticket. And Nixon’s picking (Spi-
ro) Agnew was no positive step

in the Republican campaign.”

_“This was an election where
the Democratic Party lost,” said
Mankiewicz, who criticized Pres-
ident Lyndon Johnson’s policy
which gave Humphrey a late
start in the campaign.

Mankiewicz pointed out that
the “political blunder” of the

Rioters Face Aid Cutback

by PAT BORKOWSKI
Staff News Writer

Dr. Jack Critchfield, Assistant Chancellor
of Student Affairs, said Wednesday that the
new Congressionally approved Anti-Riot Pro-
vision enabling universities and colleges to
withdraw federal financial aid from students
involved in campus demonstrations is poor
congressional thinking.

“It reflects a lack of good thinking on the
part of our congressmen,” Dr. Critchfield
said.

“Although guidelines come from the De-
partment of Health, Education and Welfare,
institutions are able to use their own discre-
tion on this policy," he said.

“Early last year, a more detailed provi-
sion was considered; this provision would have

demanded that an institution cut aid to stu-.

dents ‘disrupting the ‘campus.’ Through the
efforts of such organizations as the American
Council of Education, which believes in the
college as an autonomous unit, the measure
was modified to its present form.”

The Anti-Riot Provision states that stu-
dents convicted of any crime involving use
of force, disruption of campus activities, or
seizure of college property, face possible loss
of aid. It also requires the institution to give
formal notice and opportunity for a hearing
before denying _aid. In addition, the provi-
sion guarantees a student the right of appeal.

At the University, appeals could be di-
rected to Dr. Critchfield or the University
Review Board.

When asked if he thought the new provi-
sion will effect University policies, Dr.
Critchfield replied, “University policy has al-

‘Public Tired Of Old Politics’—Mankiewicz

University Out—of—Tune 
In Reforms, Innocvations  

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

Ken Scheuler, SG president,
claimed at the Faculty Senate

meeting Monday that “the Uni-'

versity is completely out-of-tune
in terms of educational reform
and innovation.”

“There is no explicit, satisfac-
tory statement on the goals and
philosophies of a Liberal Arts ed-
ucation at this institution, that
can be used as a guideline,” he
went on.

The speaker proposed that a
special committee be organized
to thoroughly study and evaluate
the undergraduate and graduate
education at the University. He
had three goals in mind.

“The study-analysis must give
considerable attention to 1) the
role and functions of the Univer-
sity in today’s society, and 2) the
aids_and goals of a Liberal Arts
education,” Scheuler emphazized.

“Thirdly, questionsof the eval-
uation of graduate systemsimust

in innovating education. He also
mentioned the efforts of the
Board of Visitors, composed of g
the “country’s leading experts
who visit the University period-
ically,” and the Chancellor’sAll-

University Council. However, ac—' 

cording to the SQ president, these
groups are not expansive or de-

tached enough to be completely

effective.

The model that he proposed thelf
Faculty Senate follow is one de-
veloped by Columbia University.

Columbia hired a leading psy- C

chologist, Dr. Daniel Bell, to do‘
research on the University’s
structure and orientation. Dr. Bell,
was completely free to under- .
take his study for one year.

Scheuler suggested the 'ap- ]

proaches that such a special study_‘
at the University could take.

Democratic Party was its divi-
siveness over the Vietnam War
policy. “President Johnson, be-
ing the poor politician that he is,
thought he had 58 per cent of the
people (according to a poll) be-
hind his policy in Vietnam. But
what he didn’t realize was that
40 per cent of those backed Bar-
ry Goldwater, and the other 60
per cent were always against his
conduct of the war,” he said.

Citing the Chicago convention
as the single incident which hurt
Humphrey’s campaign, Mankie-
wicz speculated that the “big city
machines are crumbling.”

The old politicians, like Chi-

have the dominate position (in
the party) but they will have a
stand in the Party” in the future,
Mankiewicz declared.

“The major parties are going
to fight over the educated class
in the next generation,” said Man-
kiewicz, who produced statistics
saying that now 60 per cent of
the population goes to college.

“The parties will also be look-
ing for new candidates who can
enthuse a party. Over the last
five or ten years, people who gen-
erate enthusiasm are thought to
be non-political,” he continued.

“Men like Dwight Eisenhower,
John Kennedy, Bob Kennedy,
Ronald Reagen, and Wallace are
perceived by followers as non-
politicians," Mankiewicz said.
“But they come across as the ene-
mies of old politics, and in the
last campaign, Nixon and Hum-
phrey were far from this. They
represented the epitome of po-
litical candidates in the political
context.”

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
Staff Coordinating Editor
A chapter of Tau Beta Sigma,
honorary sorority for four-year

college and university bandswom-
en, recently received University

I recognition on campus. Its pur-

pose is to promote the existence
and welfare of the University
band and to cultivate a respect
for band activiteis and achieve-
ments.

Tau Beta Sigma honors out-
standing women in the band
through membership extended as
a reward for technical achieve-
ment and appreciation for the
best in music. Basic requirements
are a 2.0 QPA, sophomore status,
one term experience in band, and
musical ability. '

The sorority hopes to foster

‘close relationship between col-

lege bands as well as to provide
pleasant social experience for
those in University band work.

Beta Sigma, outlined the soror-
ity’s past a_c_t_i.v_i_t_i_e_s_a_sy a reception‘

women and a tea is planned for
this evening.

“The sorority is a good oppor-
tunity for female band members
to get involved in school activ-

ities,” one member stated. “Tau '

Beta Sigma will be an incentive
for girls to join the concert
band,” she added.

Another member pointed out
that “nobody knows that the ex-.
ists, particularly the concert band.
Our main purpose will be to pro-
mote the band on campus.”

Mr. Arthur, the director of the
University Band, says that Tau
Beta Sigmapgirls “add charm to
the band and its functions.”

“The aims of the University
must be questioned; the present
operations must ,be analyzed and
a decision reached as to what in-

orient the University and its pro- ,

grams for the future,” he outlined.

“There is a very pressing need
for the University to acclimate
to the changes in society,”
Scheuler said.

The Faculty Senate’s response
to Scheuler’s claims and propos-

als was enthusiastic and contro- ‘
versial. It “went crazy,” said the .

SG president.

Faculty members discussed the
need for an intensive reevaluation
of the University. They talked
about the present teaching meth-
ods, learning approaches, the role

of graduate teaching assistant
and the question of a multiversi

Two proposals were made at the Faculty Senate Mondayby SG“ -b

President Ken Scheuler:

(1) The bill providing for two student representatives on the five
Faculty Senate Committees be amended to include the Academic Free-
dom and Tenure and Budget Policies Committees. ~

—(2) A special study be commenced to thoroughly evaluate the-
quality_ of undergraduate and graduate education at the University
of Pittsburgh. This study would surevey such areas as: ' '

-—-The role and function of the University in contemporary Americ-' ‘ p '

can society.

—The aims of a “liberal arts” education.
—Evaluation of the baccalaureate degree. 5

——Size of classes. -

—-Problems of course orientation.

—Teaching methodology.

——Graduate students as teachers and grader.
'—Method of testing, grading, and the pass-fail system.

—Seminar system and senior colloquia; independent study and

auditing.

—Advising systems; field of concentration program.
—The role of the student in policy-making.

Scheuler added that “ideally this study should be directed by a 
highly qualified academician who would be hired for a full year of V-
research with no other responsibilities. For example, Daniel Bell '
was commissioned by Columbia for its research study.”

  ‘Anti-Riot’ Act

,, The United States Government seems to be supporting
legislation and institutions that are contrary to the interests
and necessities of higher education. Aside from sponsoring
.a draft that is fast deleting the male graduate student popula-
ltion, the Government recently enacted an anti-riot pro-

‘vision enabling universities to discontinue federal financial

aid to those students participating indisruptive campus de-
monstrations. This, in our view, is a spit in the eye dissent.
The Congress, however, has done much more in the name
of. anti-education budget cutting. Going beyond the pass-
age of the anti-riot provision, the “Education Congress” has,
-for the past two years, slashed the recommended budget al-
location for teaching fellowships. Last years request was cut
from $96 million to $86.6. The Congress cut the fellowship
app_ropriation,_ this year, from $86.6 to a mere $70 million.
},To make‘ matters worse, the Congress slashed the allocation
for the educational opportunity grant program from

$159.6 million to $124.6 million.
A new Congress has been elected, and the prospects

that this group of politicians will look with favor to education

Congress are cowards when matters come between a choice
of pleasing the “people back home” and standing up for
-“what is right.-” .

A possible solution is to start collective movement to pres-
sure the Congress into changing its idea that education is
less than top priority. Student power can be combined with
-university power. The universities have in the past, pres-
sured Congress concerning matters of higher education. But
ther has never been a collective movement. With a little plan-
ning, all university presidents — men who share similar fin-

could easily persuade the Congress of the real importance of
education. '

A Pressure influences the Congress, for the men who‘ hold
seats in the Capitol, feel that winning an election is more

[ important than the education of the people.

 The Educational Opportunity, budget slash constitutes a
78 per cent cutback of funds for needy students. In this aca-
demic year, 144,600 students are receiving these Federal Edu-
cation grants. At the beginning of the nextacademic year,
only 31,300 students will receive these grants.
While these appropriation slashes go unnoticed by the

public, many needy students who now receive Federal
-subsidies may have to discontinue their education; many of
students may be stuck in the financial quagmire created
by an anti-education Congress. The Congress and the Govern-
Jment have again revealed their disdain for the “people.”
Political expediency is far more important, it seems, than
the education of America’s youth. Obviously the Govern-
ment has a wrarped sense of priorities.

The Congress didn’t bat an eye when the dubiously in-
spired Highway Expansion Act was passed._ More funds were
allocated for this “highly popular” piece of legislation,
than_for bills, that didn’t fill the contituency’s' pockets
with, Federal money. The Congress is more interested in
passing legislation making campus radicals bent on demon-
stration think twice before comitting a grevious act than in

enacting legislation strengthening open dissent in the pursuit

of rational ends. Indeed, the members of the Congress were
‘ merely thinking of their political futures when the Anti—riot
provision was passed. There are far too few Congressmen
or Senators who stand up for “unpopular principle.” This,
: of course, is political suicide, in these times.

It is no wonder that students and University administra-
,tors are quickly losing faith in the men and machinery of

our government. While education receives a small portion

of budegetary attention, the defense budget is literally pad-
ded with some $86 billion. We spend more money on
death and destruction than on education, poverty, and health.

_ _ This is absurd.

The absurdity exists because the Congress is slowly
but surely" destroying the very strength of America —— the

5 universities. Men in Congress seem to look to personal
rather than national interests. In this ludricrous situation

something must be changed. If the Congress — and the Gov-
ernment — do not beef-up the education budget in the near
future, allpolitical expediency and personal opporunism will
backfire not only in the faces of the Congressman, but in
‘the face of the nation. The educational needs of this nation

 

..can.no_t be placed in the background of national priority.

are dim, for political expediency still exists. Most men in

ancial worries — could organize into a powerful force which.

Mr. Mankiewicz Misses Point;

It is amazing how an intelligent and informed
person. like Frank Mankiewicz. can put visions into

words.

But it is even more amazing how that same in-

platitudes t_o appeal to an audience (in this instance.

-——Marat Sade
They Persecuted

And Assassinated
Jean-Paul Marat; Murdered. Death

by THOMAS MILLER
Staff Entertainment Writer

David Merrick once defended
his right to bar any critic from the
theatre who was about to commit
premeditated murder on one of
his plays.

There is little danger that a
critic would murder The Persecu-
tion and Assassination of Jean-
Paul Marat as Performed by the
Inmates of Asylum of Charenton
Under the Direction of the Mar-
quis de Sade.” The real danger is
that the play might do him in. It
is extremely hard to leave Steph-
en Foster Memorial and know
quite what to say about Marat-
Sade.

Marat-Sade is an idea and it
may be presumptuous _and unfair
to that idea to even attempt to con-
fine it to a summary, but the
main theme of the play must be
explained if the rest of this rec-
ommendation is to be of any use.

Peter Weiss, the author, takes
advantage of two historically true
facts. Jean-Paul Marat was indeed
a revolutionary in the days of the
French upheaval and toward the
end of his life he was confined in
his activities by a skin disease. It
is also true that Marquis de Sade
presented plays at the Asylum at
Charenton where he was incar-
cerated.

These two stories have been
joined by Mr. Weiss in order to
present to the audience a play
within the play. Marquis directs
and the other inmates in an at-
tempt 2 to discover whose philoso-
phy is true. Marquis de Sade be-
lieves that the only reality left
is that of individuality while

Marat‘s passion is for radical so- .

cial revolution.

In the end everyone expects a
decision from the author, but Mr.
Weiss is not about to give satis-
faction. The answer lies in how
the observer responds to the 33
episodes which the Marquis has
chosen to show.

The Marquis sees his conclu-
sion as right, but he realizes that
he must be defeated since mass
revolution destroys individuality
.and the people will invariably

‘clamor for revolution. But he nev- I

‘ er concedes that social revolution

triumphs either.

0n the contrary, it fails be-
cause the people are not seeking
ideals — just that power, greed,
and ignorant insensitivity that
once belonged to someone else.
Marquis de Sade dismisses social
ideals as easy to invent, but so
difficult to act upon.

The University Theatre has tak-
en this struggle and forces the
audience to be involved, intrigued
and certainly stimulated toward
some reaction. Marat-Sade is an
ideamadeliving and loud.‘

No one in the audience can ig-
nore it, for it is constantly mov-
ing, constantly violent, and con—
stantly challenging the playgoer
to make his choice between Mar-
at and de Sade.

The University Theatre is suc-
cessful in providing both the force
of the ideas and the background
of insanity. The characters run
around, scream at each other, and
scream at the audience.

There are musical passages. too,
in which the situation is further
burlesqued. It is a totally em-
bracing production. As Dr. F.

Curtin.Canfield says in the pro-

gram, Marat-Sade is a "multiple-
barreled assault on all our senses
at once.” The University student
should find this appealing.

The cast of Marat-Sade is dili-
gent in its lunacy and the effect

is often shocking. ‘Within this con— h

text the Marquis and Marat must
remain in the stable eye of the
hurricane apart from the rabble.

The projection of their thoughts
relies on this and Daniel Nalbach
as de Sade and Bert Nemitz main-
tain this detatched saneness. The
four revolutionaries provide most
of the social ideas through mime
and song. They are interesting to
watch and they deserve attention
in the program.

There are many people cited in
the program to whom credit is due
for this production. And it would
be seriously unfair not to express
appreciation to Dr. Canfield for
the production of Marat-Sade. It
is quite an undertaking.

-l—-—— Over The Edge

I Won’t Listen To You Anymore,
I Want To Think For Myself

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

Hey! All you young radicals
that attended the Dick Gregory
rally four weeks ago, I want to

g tell you some things. I’m talking

in particular to those of you who
were nodding their heads so vi-
gorously when Mr. Gregory was
saying.

the way you
want to; don’t

gram you. If
you don’t agree
with your pro-
fessor, don’t
agree. Just don’t

let anyone pro-
gram y o u r
mind.” 0

YOU ALL remember that don’t
you? Why of course you do.
Some of the more vocal members
of the audience even stood up
and clapped their palms together.
Yeh man, it sure was great. But
what have you done since that
rally?
you read that have been inter-
preted for you by your profes-
sor? How many of you were too
lazy to think for yourself, and
were completely satisfied to take
the word of some world re-
knowned critic? How many of

A you listened to someone else’s

interpretation and then regur-
gitated it back onto your little
blue book? A lot of you? Well,
don’t feel bad, you’re a secure
part of the majority.

    

How many books have .

But not meaning to sound

V proud (which I am), I did do

something. I took Mr. Gregory’s
advice. I have decided not to at-
tend my two literature courses,
but I will read the books on my
own conclusions, and actually
write them down on a test.

If you are curious how the pro-
fessors will react to this rebel-
lion, I’ll tell you. Here is an ap-
proximate dialogue with ‘one o
my professors. »

“I’ve decided not to attend
your lectures anymore?’

“Why not?”

“Because for once in my sis-
teenyears of schooling, I’m go-
ing to think for myself I’m going
to read all the books and inter-
pret them the way I see them.”

“(angrily) But how can-you do
that? People have studied these
works for years and years. They
have read criticisms, they have

77

“But I don’t want to hear what
a book means to someone else.
I want to think for myself. Just
one time I don’t want anyone’s
ideas or interpretations.”

“(even angrier) Very well,
you go ahead and do this, and I
will see from your test how well
you interpret.” '

“I ' DON’T CARE how you
think I interpret. I‘don’t care if
you give me an F.”

A “(complete silence caused by
disarmament) Do you plan to

give me these ideas out of a
complete vacuum?”

‘‘I’m not a vacuum. I’ll just be
devoidpof anyone elses interpre-
tations. And who are you to tell
me how to think.”

“I am your professor.”

“Oh (disgust enveloping my
entire being), That sure is a good
reason. (uttered with biting sar-
casm). But I don’t care what
grade you give me, or what you
think of my answer.” ‘

“THEN I WILL tell you what
to do. Do this thing that you pro-
pose, and if your answers are
similar to mine, then . . . .”

“(slowly losing my patience)
Why do they have to be similar.?
What if they’re completely dif-
ferent?” _ ‘ i

“(bewildered)_ Then we will
see your grade.” ’

“So give me an F, call me an
idiot, think my brain is a complete

vacuum. But just remember that
the ideas on my test came from ,

my own thoughts and no one
elses.” (end of conversation)

If any of you in the reading

audience have some cause to‘

doubt‘ what I’ve just related,
go up to one of your professors
and tell him you want to think
on your own. Tell him you think

Only’ ‘War’
Keeps Peace

Editor, The Pitt News

Concerning the letter by Mr.
Vic Papale in the Nov. 11 issue
of The‘Pitt News,‘ ROTC ex-
ists as a means of training men
to become officers in the United
States Army-Air Force, and does
so by methods most practically
and precisely suited to this cause.

Mr. Papale’s contrived con-
cept of ROTC course content —
“the study of how to kill;” his
absurd statement as to its ob-
jectives — to “train killers;” and
his definition of war as be-
ing merely “organized killing”,
clearly reflect a degree of nar-
row mindedness. V

No one can deny the evils of

war, but only through war .can_ we
preserve and protect our inalien-

able right to speak out against it! _

ROTC exists not to corrupt, but
to protect. ROTC exists ultima-
tely to protect you, Mr. Papale.

ROTC Purpose:
Train Officers

Editor, The Pitt News

There have been several let-
ters in your newspaper recently
which stated that the purpose of
ROTC is to teach killing.

I say, the purpose of ROTC is
to train officers to serve in the
U.S. Army. The purpose of the
U.S. Army is to protect and defend
our country.

The second amendment to
the constitution states that a well-
regulated militia is necessary
to the security of a free state.

Would those. who protest ROTC
wish to see the entire armed for-
ces abolished, in which case,
each American would have to
take his own_ responsibility to
defend himself? 9

Could it be that our ROTC ca-
dets live their country and wish
to take part in protecting it?

Nixon Is His ‘Own Man’

Editor, The Pitt News

On November 6 George Wal-
lace announced that he was re-
sponsible for Nixon’s victory.
This claim was pounced on by
the commentators who pointed
out that the effects of Wallace’s
candidacy were "quite obscure,
hurting Humphrey in New Jer-
sey, boosting him in Texas.

The one man to whom Nixon
is’ beholden is not Wallace,
but the much less dangerous Strom

One of the big question marks if

hanging over Nixon concerns how
much influence he is willing to
grant Thurmond. ~.

Given Nixon’s political cunning,
he should have no difficulty in
kicking over the ladder on which
he rose. Perhaps Nixon already
has complete freedom of move-

I would like very much to
share with you a bit of verbal
kitch I heard while involved in
a discussion with some represen-
tatives of the Students for a De-
mocratic Society (SDS) who were
manning a table on the Ground
-Floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, Nov. 11.

While pointing out to me the
various reasons why our Ameri-
can system should be torn as-
under, the young lady behind
the folding table‘ informed me
that 133 per cent, yes, one hun-
dred thirty-three per_cent,_ of all
unemployed people in_'the United
States are Negroes. ' '

No, ‘she didn’t say quote, that‘
133 per cent of the unemployed
in this country are black people,

Isn’t snsi:-5. ‘unny

unquote; she merely said that forty

percent of the Negro labor force _

was unemployed and that the na-
tional average was three percent.
, I wanted to make sure so I
asked her if she meant that in
some of the worst ghetto areas
Negro unemployment was forty
percent. She said, “No, that’s for
the entire nation; forty per cent
of all American Negroes are un-
employed.” Well now, the size
of the national labor force is

about 70,000,000. Three percent‘

of that comes out to about 2,100,-
000. The Negro labor force. is
about 7,000,000. Forty percent of
that is about 2,800,000. 2,800,-_
000 is 133 per cent of 2,100,000!
Isn’t the SDS a funny bunch?

fem‘ the outset, one can see i

usually view a “slice of life’’
play.

This Brechtian effect of shock-
ing the audience into an aware-
ness of the fact that it is seeing
a play (and not “life as it.real,y
is”) is sustained throughout the
play by the character of the her-
ald who is admirable portrayed
by Gregory Lehane, a University
Undergraduate.

After Coulmier’s greeting,
the audience is bombarded with a
succession of what can only be
called bizarre events on stage.

It is difficultggand rather point-
less to describe them all, for they
aren’t part of the plot. True, these
events serve to enhance the plot;
but if one wants to find out the
plot of the play, he merely has to
read the full title, The Persecu-
tion and Assassination of Jean-
Paul Marat as Performed by the
Inmates of the Asylum of Charen-
ton Under the Direction of the
Marquis de Sade.

Be that as it may, these events
are both funny and sad, sensible
and ridiculous, and purposeful
and grossly vulgar at the same
time.

cut meaning from them. The In-

mates say they want a revolut-
lon, but it must have “general
copulation.”

They sing of their desire to be
free and perform beheadings at
the same time. The singing it-
self is sometimes good, sometimes
bad, and the acoustics of Stephen
Foster Memorial are not the best.
The four mimes, who do most of
the singing, have a hard time pro-

« jecting their voices, and the most

effective singing comes when the
whole cast wails (literally) to-
gether.

The musical accompaniment
is good, especially when one real-
izes that the orchestra does not
have all the musicians for which
the play calls.

Mary Robb Carr does a very
good_ job as Corday, probably the
most difficult character to per-
form. She must be a singer, a
victum of sleeping sickness,
a lover, and a murderer almost si-
multaneously, and Miss Carr
does all of these rather well.

is a comedy melodrama about a
once successful concert pianist
(Charles Aznavour) reduced to
playing in a pub who becomes
involved with a couple of wildly
improbable pipe-smoking gun-
men. Both films are typical ‘of
Truffaut and the New Wave
for their unique freshness of de-
tail, their amusing irrelevancy of
incident and their beguiling sense
of parody.

Two Bergman _films also re-
main out of this month’s fare. In
The Magician know to some as
The Face Max von Sydow plays
a traveling hypnotist, Volger, who»
manages to terrify the simple
folk of Stockholm in 1846 with
his weird illusions. Eventually,
the townspeople discover that all
his tricks are the products of mir-
rors and projectors and Volger
and his troupe are taunted into
leaving, hating the city for its
bourgeois rationality and criti-
cism. '

The Seventh Seal, another film
directed by Bergman, is.one of
his undisputed best. Using the
allegory and medi-val Swedish
setting, Bregman interrogates
the Christian traditionand the piti-
ful gropings of man‘ to com-

prehend the world around him in .

a style that is uniquely Scandina-
vian. _

THE FILM for tomorrow and
Thursday is The Blue Angel
starring Marlene Dietrich as the
sexy night club singer, Lola
Lola. This movie marks the first
time Josef von Sternberg worked
with her, the first effort of a com-
bination that was to result in the
sensational emergence of Die-
trich as the eternal feminine.

Other films on tap for this
month that are too important to
overlook are Akira Kurosawa’s
Yojimbo, a comedy—western
Japanese style, Agnes Varda’s
poetic love story Le Bonheur,
and Marcel Camus’ classic Black
Orpheus.”

The two male leads are almost
as good. Mr. Nemitz does a very-
efficient job in portraying the brood-
ing Marat; he projects well at
the crucial times and brings con-
sistency to the part.

Mr. Nalbach is nearly as con-
vincing as deSade. He doesn’t
always articulate well and
doesn’t seem to move as easily
as he should. 0

The difficult whipping scene
isn’t as effective as it should be, for
Nalbach doesn’t convince us of de
Sade"s pain and ‘internal torture
very effectively. '

The physical stage itself is
probably the greatest limit to the
effectiveness of the produc-
tion. There simply isn’t enough
room for the actors to move in
and for the stage to be built to
its greatest effectiveness.

However, the set is designed
well and helps‘ make the overall
spectacle more convincing.

Lighting in this play really
doesn’t play an importantpart,
and neither does the costuming,
since the majority of the inmates
are dressed alike in burlap sacks. -

The period cloths (early 19th
century) are pretty and authentic.
However, the make-up is important,
for it must make the actors look
authentically mad. It most cer-
tainly does.

The most interesting thing
about the whole production is that
the audience can’t believe the
grostesque happenings on stage, '
doesn’t understand most of the
philosophical dialgoue, is rather
stunned by the language, and yet
is totally engrossed in the play.

This is what Marat-Sade is
supposed to-do, and the Univer-
sity’s production of it comes
close to doing just that.

Dear Mr. DeYoung:

The urban blight, because of its
concomitant insurgency of the city
dweller, has finally been thrust before the
all-too-unwilling eyes of the American
public. Studies indicate that to alleviate
the problem, we should spend many
billions on our cities within the next
decade. The problem grows worse daily;
however, business resists government
intervention and control.

Our skies are filthy with smog, smoke,
soot, and stench; yet only legislation could
force industry to place antipollution
devices on its automotive products and
the same seems true for its smokestacks.
Our rivers are already fetid conduits;

yet, for purely economic reasons, industry
continues to dump its noxious
by-products into public waters rather
than otherwise dispose of them.

Our cities are a snarl of transportation
congestion, yet business solves that
problem“ by merely running away to
develop new branches in unaffected areas.
Our urban housing is often unfit for
habitation; yet, rather than redevelop
close-in housing and recreation for its
employees and potential customers,
business does nothing until government
urban renewal takes charge—then
business complains of waste, graft,
inefficiency, and intrusion upon

free enterprise.

What evidence of civic responsibility
extending beyond the stockholder does

business show? When will business

relinquish its myopic view of "PROFIT

‘ NOW!" in favor of long-term benefits?

can you, as a businessman, feel proud of
business’ record on these important issues?

Yours truiy,7//awétﬂpréwﬂg

Mark Bookspan
Pre-Med, Ohio State

Dear Mr. Bookspan:

Unquestionably our central cities

are faced with the explosive pressures
being built by the interacting

ills of slum housing, relative poverty,
hard-core unemployment, traffic con-
gestion, air and water pollution. These

are not new problems, but the urgent
demand for solution is underscored by the
many episodes of readily—triggered violehce
now so commonly seen.

Yet paradoxically, as these crises worsened,
our overall economy has witnessed
unparalleled productivity, higher
employment, and better living standards
for the larger majority of our population
thaniever in history. ' '

In turn, this has precipitated a trek to
suburbia of such proportion that many
downtown residential areas have been '
virtually abandoned to a highly explosive.
usually non-white, residual population.

There are no pat solutions to these
problems. Consider for a moment the
magnitude of the efforts during the past
thirty years relative to urban renewal,
public housing, and the war on poverty.
The results have fallen far short of the
expectations voiced by those who
advocated massive public spending and
the multiplication of additional govern-
mental agency programming. In this
context, 1 think it is not an exaggeration
to say that the defining of goals for the _
community, and the determination of the
means for their achievement, was
regarded strictly as governmental pre-
rogative and strictly outside of

business’ purview.

Yet there is now an increasingly vocal ’
ground swell that private industry
somehow holds the key to solving the
more pressing urban prob|ems—if only
its attention can be diverted from its
”b|ind‘pursuit of profits," and its
social conscience awakened.

As Kenneth Clark, the well-known Negro
psychologist, has said:""Business and
industry are our last hopes because they
are the most realistic elements of our
society."

To assess the collective activities of
business throughout ‘the nation, in
developing and implementing practicable
solutions for varying aspects of urban
problems, is manifestly impossible. But
let me mention a number of typical
examples in the field of air and water
pollution.

The auto, steel, oil, rubber, lumber, paper,
and chemical industries, to name a few,‘
have expended literally billions of dollars
in applied research and in the installation_
of mechanical apparatus for the appreciable
reduction of smog, noxious fumes, dust,
silt, and other air and water pollutants.
Examples: the steel industry in the
Chicago area has eliminated 27,000 tons

of the 88,000 tons of particulate matter '
that accumulates annually "to aggravate the
city's air problem . . . Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors have.programs ranging
from the control of fumes ‘given off in
painting auto bodies, and water pollutants
from chromeplating processes, to dust

, Sincerely,  Lh-

collectors at foundries. to intense research
for economically practical auto exhaust
controls _ _ _ Crou/n Zellerbach has
developed means to eliminate 90 per cent
of the solidsand 98 per cent of the
hydrogen sulphide from gases leaving its
kraft mills - - i- ‘

Dow chemical has instituted various
successful methods to reduce water
pollution from industrial plant wastes, and
to reclaim certain types of ponds and
natural streams . . . In Goodyear, installa-
tion of a $750,000 waste water treatment
system at our facilities in Gadsden,
Alabama, assures purification of millions ‘
of gallons daily before return to -the
Coosa River. Moreover, air and water
pollution control equipment is being
installed in some eight other plants, while
all new facilities under construction, or
those recently built, have such controls in
their specifications. All of this has been
done voluntarily. Does this action bespeak
of “Profits Now," as you suggest?

But industry isn't the only source of air
and water pollution, much needs to be
done in the areas of public and private
housing, sewage control, and garbage
disposa|—-just to name a few.

v Slum housing, hard-core unemployment,

education, and traffic congestion also are
the focus of direct business involvement.

In short, business is responding to the V
challenge of the times by channeling some
of its capabilities directly to public sector
requirements. Westinghouse, alone, is
spending millions in this areaand the list
of others is considerable. _

’ Business’ success in such programs results

solely from capabilities which have been
perfected through the disciplines of our
free enterprise system. Business’ real forte
l_ies in itseffective meeting of customer
needs and demands by the translation

of creative research, production abilities.
and resources through managerial skills
under the incentive of profit-making. The
profits generated as a result of this
process provide the underpinnings of

our entire economy.

In other words, business is in business to
make a profit. It is only through the
accrual of profits that funds are available
for all social improvement programs,
whether originated by the public sector, or
at the instance of business’ own

initiative, orjointly with government.

A thorough appraisal of the record, there-
fore, will reveal that the nation's business
community—both on its own and in’
concert with government—is developing,
underwriting, and implementing, viable
efforts to solve the.problems which you
rightfully say demand attention. In terms
of responsiveness to these’ needs. and _
increasingly effective solutions, I thi-nk a -
noteworthy record is in the making, with .
expenditures ranging in the billions.
Withoutprofits, this money would not be
available for these programs, which offer no
monetary'return to industry whatsoever.

Cubs Host Ohio State Froslil

Kokor Expects Short Flips
To Decide Last Cub Clash

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

Two running teams clash this afternoon at I230 p.m. at
Forbes Field, but freshmen football coach Carl Kokor seems
to feel that passing might be the deciding factor in either a

Cub or Ohio State victory.

Ohio State has a proven, off—tackle power offense that is highly
rated among frosh grid teams this fall. Against a reputably strong
Indiana eleven, the Acorns pounded out a 40-14 decision. ‘

“They scored 40 points and
there were no cheapies,” said Ko-
kor. “In our score against Penn
State, if you subtract the cheapies,
you had some ballgame. ”

If the Cub offense doesn’t
give up the “cheapies” to Ojio
State, passing may very well be
the deciding factor.

"‘We’re basically a running
team too,” said Kokor, “but
when both teams are basically
running teams, that’s when passing
seems to come in. ‘

“When ”both teams keep run-

   
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

only change in the Cub defense.

ning,” continued Kokor, "the
defenses have hit, hit, hit, on
their minds. That’s when the little
flipper and little flapper to the
sidelines does the damage.”

Quarterback Lou Angelo,
starting his first game as the Cub
signal-caller, is the player
Kokor’s hopes will rest on.

“He’s a very quick fellow,”
said Kokor, “and he has great
body movement.”

Angelo replaces Tony Embessi
in the line-up. Embessi, who im-
pressed Kokor with his quarter-
backing~ performances against
the Little Lions, is out with a
shoulder separation.

Angelo will be working with
the same starting offensive unit
that Embessi had, with the ex-
ception of either Hank Alford
or Bob Ginden at tight end.

“Angelo won’t play defense
in this game,” said Kokor, “so
Bill Donovan will replace him.”

Donovan, the starting tight
end last Friday, will stay on de-
fense as a back. But he’s not the

“You” "coul?1"'s'a'y' "the" "Jungle

Kokor. “John Hollosy is out with
an injury, Willie Saloky will pro-
bably see a lot of action as prow-
ler because of Joe Carroll’s in-
jury, John Wilborn is starting at
end, and Joe Baranick is starting
at middle guard.” ‘

With three of the ‘jungle Cats’
starting, and two others out for
health reasons, the new defensive
unit surely has died. But Kokor
still expects a 100 percent effort
against Ohio State from his
spirited frosh.

‘Jumpshot’ChcatsYorgis

It looks like the race for first place among the Yogis is all:
over, but there is a heated contest for the number two spot.

“I’ve been trying for a long time,” siad Roy “Jumpshot” Jacobs
“but I’ll finally be in second place after this week-end.” A

“Jumpshot” is "banking on a
couple of hot picks to jump ahead
of George “Moustachio” Lies.
The Hawks coach figures that if
he can’t beat his opponents fair-
ly, he’ll cheat.

“I didn’t cheat,” cried “Jump-
shot,” “I just had outside help
for my picks.”

The rest of the Yogis don’t
seem bothered by “Jumpshot’s”
unethical actions.

“He never knows what he’s
doing anyway,” laughed Art “bu-
ba” Rosengarten,” so he probably
asked the Guru, or Krushchev,
or some other winner for the
picks.”

A “Moustachio,” however,
thought “Jumpshot” hurt his
chances by using outside help.
That is, untile he realized that
“Jumpshot” gave his unknown’
picker this week’s games to pick
and not last week’s.

“I didn’t_think that he’d think
of thinking to use this week’s

   
 
  
  
  
   
  
   
   
  
 

games,” moaned “M01/istachio...i’.
“But I guess I thought wrong.” .._

In any case, well actuallyonly 2?
in this specific case, “Jump,
shot” has six different picks thans.
“Moustachio.” The one game that _
separates the two have nots seems?-
awfully shaky. '

Face Best In
 East At N.Y.g

by BILL NAAB

. "Come Monday morning,
= Jerry Richey and his team-
~mates will have run against
Vtheir roughest cross country
competition to this date.
‘Coach Jim Banner’s harriers
travel to Van Cortland Park
A in the Bronx to center the IC4A’s
This is the first time ever that
.Banner has" taken the cross
country team as a varsity unit to
compete in the highly regarded
IC4As. '
I ‘Richey remarked that the top-
‘notch eastern invitational will be
“harder than any race that we’ve
run in before.” Banner ‘mention-
ed that anything can happen,
since 170 individuals of various
_’talent will be rivaling one an-
’ other for the top spots in the race.

A He predicts that Georgetown,
- Villanova, Harvard, Penn State,
Pitt, St. John's, and Manhattan
will provide the fierce compe-
tition.

In addition, Banner indicated
that Jerry Richey, Steve Stage-
berg, and Tom Donneley should
_.be the outstanding individuals
.of. the IC4As. He remarked,
“There are also always plenty of
darkhorses, and the competi-
tion is always very keen.”

He added that his squad has
a looked exceptionally good in prac-
tice this week. “They’re more
relaxed, and they’ve got a good
spirit. They’ll do the best they can,
the coach stated. '

Undefeated distanceman Jerry
Richey mentioned that he believes
that he has a fine chance to re-

lmain unbeaten and win the IC4A
. race. Jerry said, “I won’t say that
- I’m really confident, but I do
;‘think I've got a good chance. I
actually can’t tell how tough the
race will be. I have no basis to
’judge the meet, since I haven't
run against most of the indivi-
duals.” ’

Moreover, he believes that the
squad‘has a chance to eke into
the top three finishing positions.
.“If everyone performed at their
best, there’s a chance to break
into the top three,” Jerry stated.
,He_ additionally mentioned that
A the squad has been looking for-
ward to the all-important IC4As.

“Since the loss to Penn State,
we’re a little less confident, but
we’re more relaxed. We were too
.tight for Penn State. I’m sure that
h we can do better relaxed,” Richey
reflected.

In addition to his varsity har-
riers, Banner plans to take Bob
Hagner and Dave Cobb to the fresh-
men ,IC4As_. He commented that
“their conditioning isn't what it
should be. Both started late and
both were ill.”

Army Focus

JERRY RICHEY
Faces Toughest Test

Jarvis Helps Academy
Fight Off Inconsistency

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL '

Army brings to Pitt Stadium its worst record in three years
under head coach Tom Cahill, but this year’s Cadet eleven is no
weaker than the past two Army teams that dumped the Pan-
thers, 28-0 and 21-12, respectively.

When Tom Cahill replaced Paul Dietzel as head mentor,—in~ 1966,

eight victories in ten contests.

This year, the Cadets are 5-3,
but will be heavy favorities in
their two remaining games against
the Panthers and Navy’s Midship-
men. Overall, it’s another success-
ful season for Cahill and once
again Army’s "success depends on
a strong defense.

This year’s Army defensive
unit has limited the opposition
to 15 points per game, largely as
a result of the menacing veteran
backfield. Returning from last
year’s squad are Tom Haller, Den-
nis Hutchinson, and Pete Dencker;

all of them started last year. Jim.

McCall adds depth to a crew -that
intercepted 19 passes in the first
six games this fall.

The defensive line is small,
but quick. Tackles Steve Yarnell
(5-11, 195) and Dave Humphrey,
(6-1, 200) are flanked by ends
Bill Price (6-2, 195) and Dick
Luecke (6-2, 195), and middle
guard Joe Neuman (6-1, 205).

But the defense has collapsed
in their last three contests, sur-
rendering 25, 28, and 27 points
respectively. Thus, the Panthers
will not be up against "a consis-
tent defensive unit.

Neither will the Panthers be
pitted against a consistent of-
fense. Fullback Charlie Jarvis is
consistent, and has averaged close
to 100 yards per game this season
on 5.1 yards per carry.

Halfbacks Lynn Moore and Bill
Hunter have also played__e9_ri_sis-

I he gained immediate success, leading Army to an 8-2 mark and cap-
turing Coach-of-the—Year honors. In

1967, Arrnyagain finished with

tent, football. Moore averaged
almost six yards per carry
through his first six games, while
Hunter has penetrated opposing
lines for 4.6 yards per carry.

The pass combination of quar-
terback Steve Lindell and tight
end Gary Steele has also been an
Army strongpoint all season.

But Army has been inconsis-
tent in its ability to score, and much
of it has been due to some of the
same problems that haunt the
Panthers. However, in two of
their last three games, the Cadets
have scored over 50 points.

Army was penalized 285 yards
through its first six games, and
fumbles further frustrated Cadet
drives. Through the first six games,
the Cadets fumbled 14 times and
were intercepted 8 more times.

So the Panthers will find them-
selves battling a strong, but in-
consistent foe. However, Army’s
quick defensive unit and full-
back Charlie Jarvis make up for
many Cadet mistakes. Army is
justly picked the favorite for to-
morrow’s clash, but the Panthers
seem to have more of a chance
than a 22 point underdog is us-
ually given.

Serious Richey Awaits

First Real Challenge

by‘MARTHA HARTLE

Jerry Richey is a winner; he hasn’t lost a cross-country race
since coming to the University, but he’ll face his toughest test
to date in the IC4A competition in New York City this week-

end.

“I’ll be taking the IC4A’s seriously," Richey explained. “The

competition will be real good.”
' Richey admits that he hasn't

“ been pushed in any of his races
~ yet this season. “My hardest race

was at West Virginia against Carl

. Hatfield, but I was overconfident

in that race. I didn’t take him
seriously. I really haven’t been
pushed yet.”

The finest cross-country men
in the east will be pushing Rich-

ey ’at New York. The field in- A
vcludes both last year’s first and

second place finishers, Steve
Stageberg of Georgetown a_nd
Art Dulong of Holy Cross.

“They’ll be touch,” he com-
mented. “They established them-
selves last year. I haven’t faced
anybody as tough as Stageberg.”

“It’s hard to compare my times
with these guys,” he continued,
“but I have run about a half
minute faster than them in five
miles at Notre Dame, but this
course in New York is hilly. No-
tre Dame’s was flat, so it’s hard to
compare times.”

Site of the IC4A competition
is Van Cortland Park and Richey
has never run the entire course.
“It’s a good course," Richey ex-
plained. “I ran the frosh course,
but I haven’t seen the last two
miles of it. I know there’s a big

‘hill there though.

“It’s a lot like" our course,”

- he continued, “but actually the

course doesn’t have much to do
with the race; it’s up to the run-
ners.”

John Baker of Maryland and
Tom Donnelly of Villanova are

two more heralded runners who

will be in New York. Baker is a /
sophomore and some observers ‘K
have rated him on a par with
Richey.

“I ran against Baker in high
School and this summer,” ex-
plained Richey. “I beat him by
a half minute in cross country
but he’s just started developing.”

Richey beat Donnelly last year
indoors in the two mile race, and
he doesn’t consider the Villan-
ova runner as big a threat as the
others. But he explained that his
victory last year in the two mile
can’t be compared to a five mile
race. “There’s a lot of difference
between two miles and five miles.
I’m not real confident of my
strength for five miles.”

“The IC4A’s are the Eastern
championships and it would be
nice to win,” he explained, “but
there not so important as the NCAA
competition next weekend. But
this is a big meet and it’s a chance
to see how good you are because
of the competition.

Last Boot Game

F rosh Seek. Second Win

by MARTIN HELLMAN

The freshman soccer team
will play its final scheduled
tomorrow against Frostburg State
Teachers College of Maryland.
Although the contest was origin-
ally to be played at Frostburg,
heavy snows there will force the
team to play at Carnegie-Mel-
lon’s field tomorrow morning.

County’ cancelled a game which
had been scheduled for Tuesday.
This means that the squad will
participate in. only four games
this season.

In the past three weeks since
the disappointing 2-1 loss to
CMU, coach Pete Snyder has
emphasized shooting drills in
practice. “We haveheen working
onshooting the ball from inside
the 18-yard goal area,” he re-
marked. “Also the boys have
practiced setting up shots _and
getting them off better than in
previous games,” he added.

Snyder has good reason to want
the hooters to shoot more accu-
rately. The squad has taken over
90 shots in the first three games,
yet have only six goals to its cred-
it.

The three week layoff has al-
lowed all of the booters except
center-forward Pete Mace to re-
cuperate from injuries. He will
be the only player not suited up
for the Frostburg contest.

.Snyd,er is pleased with the play
and morale of the fresh. “We

h a v e scrimmaged v e r y well
against the varsity in the prac-
tice sessions,” he explained. “The
boys showed more confidence in
their play and looked likea well
organized unit in recent days.

Soccermen Snowed-In,

Will Host Frostburg At O

CMU Fie1dTomorrow

by ED CONLEY

Home is where Leo Bemis’ soccer team probably prefers I

to stay away from. But, this weekend, due to heavy snows in
Frostburg, Md., the booters will remain here. They play Frost-
burg tomorrow at 3 p.m. on Carnegie-Mellon’s field.

The booters have won only two of nine games this fall, and both
of those victories have come on turfs belonging to the opposition.
Four games have been lost here in Pittsburgh.

Frostburg has had a little beta
ter luck than the kickers; th e i r
record shows five wins in 14 out-
ings. They have also rallied for
three ties as they go into the
game tomorrow, their last of the
season.

The teams that Frostburg has
faced have not been as rough as
the soccermen’s opposition
though.

Bemis mentioned, “Their tough-
est opponents are West Virginia
and Pitt.” -

Frostburg’s loss to the*Moun-
taineers, 5-1, shows that they
could be about even with the
kickers. The other common op-
ponents were Slippery Rock and
Grove City. Frostburg tied both
of these teams, while the booters
beat the Rockets and lost to the
Grovers.

  
    

iTeferi. Cosgrove has.been the big IV 

threat this fall, and has been pla-
tooned at two positions.

“_He roams all over the forward
line; then, they set up on him,”.—

the coach remarked about‘the'~. ‘
athlete, who plays center half-I 
hack. in the 4-3-3 set-up and
moves up to an inside line posi-f_ 

tion in the 4-2-4 formation.
Teferi, a native of Nigeria, was

Frosthurgh’s leading scorer last‘

year. In fact, he broke the school’s

scoring record. However, he broke , 

his leg, too, near the end of the

season. This has resulted in a lit-. 
tle less goal production for Teferi '

this campaign.

“Slippery Rock tells us this

line is agressive,” Bemisinoted.

“I’ve heard that there is talk up at West Point and at the Penta-
gon concerning the acceptance of a possible bowl bid,” explained
head coach Dave Hart. “All they have to do is beat us and Navy.”

Having the Cadets pin loss number eight upon the Panthers is
something that Hart and the gridders aren‘t planning on. “Practices
have been more spirited, and the boys seem eager to play football and

Upsetting Army won’t be an easy thing to do. Hart calls the Ca-
dets “the most underrated, unranked team in the country. They start-
ed out real solid defensively and now they have gone wild offensive-
ly. They really have found themselves.” ‘

Hart attributes a good deal of Army’s success to the fact that most
of the seniors have played together for three years, and the ‘team
plays as one strong unit. “They are a solid football team that does
things and does them well.

“They really have no one truly outstanding player, but they have
22 men who just simply get the job done,” added Hart.
Even though Army doesn’t have a man-as famous as a Terry Han-
ratty or a Ted Hendricks, the Cadets have three fine football players
in fullback Charlie Jarvis, quarterback Steve Lindell, and end Gary
Steele. All three are seniors.

“With an offense with those three on it,” explained Hart, “they
are certainly capable of whipping you.” Last week, Jarvis rushed for

253 yards against Boston College and in doing so,
he broke a 23-year-old record held by the immortal
Glenn Davis.

The Panthers will be doing ‘a
certain amount of keying on Jar-
vis, but they also will be keep-
ing at least one eye on Lindell.
“Well have to be on our toes.
Lindell reads defenses very well
and has a cany knack of_ mixing
up his cadences and throws the
opposing defenses off stride,” Se-
kanovich ‘said. Also, he expects
quite a number of quarterback
sneaks and keepers by Lindell.

Offensively for the Panthers,
they will have the services of
tailback Denny Ferris and full-
back Tony Esposito for the first
time in three weeks. Both sopho-
mores, when healthy, have gain-
ed over 100 yards rushing this sea-
son, with Ferrisdoing it twice.

Another aspect of the Panther
attack which coach Hart expects to improve Saturday is the passing of

open receivers.

To cope with the potent Army offense, Dan
Sekanovich, the Panthers defensive coach, hopes
that he has come up with a defense to contain the
Cadets. “We’ll basically stay with our five man
line and our four deep backs, but this week we’ll
try to get as simple as possible with our defenses,”
he said.

“We will try to take away as much indecision
-as we can from the minds of the defensive players
on each play,” he continued. “In this way we hope
to eliminate as many mistakes as possible.”

          
 
   
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
   

“Army’s linemen are a little shorter than Miami’s
and Notre Dame’s and this should make it a little
easier for Havern to spot his receivers,” said Hart.
“But Army’s defensive line is strong and quick
and this will certainly put the pressure on our line-
men to provide Havern with enough time to re-
lease the football. '

The Panthers will be regaining the services of
middle guard Lloyd Weston, prowler George Prib-
bish, defensive tackle John Stevens and defensive
end Jack Wiley. Only fullback Gary Cramer and
“‘Ez” Ed_. Whittaker are in doubt for tomorrow’s
encounter.

Hart, who likens Army to Penn State because
both teams are opportunists, hopes that his Panther
squad will begin a trend of being spoilers tomor-
row in Pitt Stadium, and carry it through till the
final game of the season against the N ittany Lions.
