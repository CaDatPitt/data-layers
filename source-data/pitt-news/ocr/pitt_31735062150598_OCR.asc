Forelnsic Foibles

Debate Officers Start Season,
Clean Out Nails, Vests, Menus

A short. beer glass, a box of as-
sorted nails, and an old postcard
showing three buxom ladies lean-
ing over a stockyard fence are
among the items the Men’s Debat-
ing association found when they
cleaned up their office the other
day.

It all started when -the new of-
ficers, under the management of
Bill Seyler, C42, decided to clean
out two debris-ﬁlled cubby holes
in the debate office.

Under a substantial layer of dust
"a number of sundry articles were
discovered and have been placed
on exhibition with labels beﬁtting
their station.

Conspicuous in the collection,
‘known as “The Evolution of a De-
bating Group,” is an empty seltzer
‘bottle, in addition to the aforemen-
tioned beer glass. These the de-
baters. promptly disowned and la-
belled as Pitt Players property.

A picture of the Men’s debating
teams of "‘192'2”‘-‘23’"‘
round collars and round haircuts
is included in the exhibition. The
box of assorted nails also contains
several curtain rod holders. The
origin of the box remains a mys-
tery.

Lying next to the box is a pair of
grayish black swimming trunks and
an old. vest left over from the Wolo-
vit regime.

The antique on display is a fold-
ing running board baggage carrier
irom a 1923 touring car. It is still
unclaimed. A cup reading “First
Prize Activities Booth,” lies severed
at its base on top of an extremely
large record of an unintelligible de-
bate.

A pair of overshoes, in good con-
dition, are also displayed.

One part of the exhibit testiﬁes 

to the economic decline of the as-
{ sociation over a period of lean
}'years. This is a collection of past
fprograms of Debate banquets, in-
cluding a large program with a lush
tblue cover which is dated 1928.

The cover of the 1934 program
is a paler blue, with somewhat
coarser paper.

The 1939 program has lost all
claim to being blue, presenting an
almost white appearance.

Some new form of progressive
education, no doubt.

U niucrsity Post

Will Head Buffalo
School of Fine Art

Phillip C. Elliott, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts and muralist,
who has been at the University
since 1935, has been appointed di-
rector oi. the Buffalo School of Fine
Arts.

Since he has been here Mr. El-
liott has taught all of the creative
art courses and started many an
embyronic artist on his way to seri-
ous study. He has designed sets for
plays produced by Pitt Players, and
has executed two murals.

Best known of his stage settings
were the ones done last year for
the production “Adding Machine.”

This year he was commissioned
to do a mural for the Lithuanian
nationality room. The ﬁnished
mural is done in fresco and is an
enlargement of the painting “Two
Kings” by the Lithuanian artist
Ciurlionis.

His new school is operated un-
der the Academy of Fine’Ar‘ts and
is associated with the Albright Art
Gallery and the University of Buf-
falo. le will assume his new du-
ties as cilirector of the school July 1..

A native of Minneapolis, Minne-
sota, lvlr. Elliott attende-d the Uni-
versity of lvlinnesota and later got
the degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts
from Yale university _in 1926. He
has acted as an instructor in the
Waterbury Art school, assistant in-
structor in the Yale sch-ool of fine
arts, instructor in arts at the Col-
lege 0 the City of New York, and
director of the Somerset Summer
Art school.

He was awarded the Chaloner
Fellowship and studied in Paris
from 1930 to 1934.

Appointment of an instructor of
fine arts to take his place will be
announced by the ﬁne arts depart-
ment at some future date.

turning from army service to re-
establish themselves, Dr. Eugene
A. Gilmore, dean of the School of
Law, revealed today.
Can Complete Courses

Under the new system students
may" complete orderly parts of
their courses before the limit of.
postponed induction expires. Local
draft boards are permitted to grant
two '60-day postponements.

“Students planning to begin the
study of law need not drop the
plan because they may be called
under the draft during the next
school year. Likewise, students
now studying law should continue
their preparations, pending their
call under the draft," Dr. Gilmore
explained.

With the year divided into the
four eight-week terms, the week-
ly’ number of hours "devoted to each
course will be doubled. The total.
weekly study of each student will
remain approximately the same,‘
according to Dr. Gilmore.

Eight Week Terms

No course will extend longer
than two terms or sixteen weeks,
and many courses will extend for
only one term or eight weeks.
Each term will be an independent
unit. Separate examinations will
be given at the end of each term.

Passing of the examination in-—
sures credit for the work com-
pleted whether the work is accom-
plished in a one or a two term
course.

Under the new curriculum, tui-
tion in the School of Law will be
based upon the term instead of the
semester, or $75 a term rather than
$150 the semester.

Receives Credit

If it is necessary for the student
to leave school during a term, the
tuition will be pro-rated. Upon the
student’s return, he will be given
credit for the unused tuition.

Those students drafted during a
term may re-enter upon completion
of their army services at the point

at which their classes were inter-

rupted. ,

University Honors Dean Amos
In.-rd:_3o1°¢1nati.0II Ritual Setting

g By WILLIAM PANKUCH
With festive greens of the Coro-
nation ceremony decorating the

,walls and pillars of Heinz chapel,

approximately 400 students, fac-
ulty members, and friends assem-
bled on Friday afternoon to pay
tribute to Thyrsa W. Amos, late
dean of women.

The greens, symbolic of the Coro—-
nation rituals associated with the
crowning of the Senior Queen, were
used to honor Miss Amos, who was
most instrumental in establishing
the annual coronation custom.
Ideals Remain

Twenty students, leaders in cam-
pus activities, formed a double row
of honorary ushers down the cen-
tral isle within the chapel. Be-
tween the black-robed ushers, pass-
ed six. members. of the altar guild,
bearing arrnsful of regal calla
lilies.

.l‘.'ia1"y Ruth Hosey, E541, and 1941
Senior Queen. spoke of the high
position held by Miss Amos  the
minds of all students who came to
know her and who share in the
benefits she has introduced.

Stating that Miss Amos hrzs
ready received her greatest tribute.
Miss Hosey explained that “many
of our Pitt women are tributes to
her" inasmuch as they represer;t
the ideals Miss Amos cherished.
“She  not gone, for she has de-
veloped women who will live full
and well."

After relating incidents which
endeared Miss Amos to the stu-
dent body. Miss Hosey concluded.
“Most of all we loved her because
of her sincere understanding of us."

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, directc-r
of the women's’ student health_se:.'-.‘-
ice, delivered the first of three com-
mernorative addresses. Speaking

.-‘I
oil-

from the viewpoint of the faculty,
Dr. Jamison eulogized the former
dean of women, whom she had
known and respected, an attitude
representative of the entire faculty.
Instilled Self-Conﬁdence

“Dean Amos did as much to make
this University nationally known as

»_ any other faculty member,” stated

Dr; Jamison. “Miss Amos created
a self confidence in everyone who
felt the value of her greatness .

all life responded to the challenge
of her friendliness.”

Speaking of the great educator’s
inspiring qualities, Dr. Jamison
continued, “Many of us left her
satisfied, for she made us see the
heart of our problem and gave us
courage to face the facts.”

Dr. Jamison quoted Miss Amos’s
constant advice, “Just learn to
know yourself.”

Established Pitt Tradition

The remarks of Dr. William R.
Faimer, University chaplain, on
the accomplishments of Miss Amos
contained true sentiment and char-
acterized the feeling of the loss
which Miss Amos’s death has con-
stituted for those who knew the po-
sition she occupied in laying the
foundations for ‘great Pitt tradi-
tions. Summarizing her efforts on
behalf of the selection and coro-
nation of a true University queen,
Dr. Farmer said. “This memorial
service is really a coronation for
Miss Amos.”

Miss Amos’ favorite anthem.
“Beautiful Savior.” was sung by
the Heinz chapel choir, accom-

panied. by Russell G. Wichmann,
University organist. Theodc-re M.
Finney, head of the department of
music appreciation, conducted the
choir.

Our Last Editorial: .
A New Order Come-tll

TODAY WE QUIT the paper and we get nos-
talgic. It has been over a year—9l issues to be
exact-—since our name ﬁrst appeared on the
masthead as editor, and we have already over-
run our stay.

Mostly it has been a year when college stu-
dents read more than comic pages and Pittpourri.
Seniors and juniors worried more about draft
numbers than blueprints or job prospects. Pro-
fessors and assistant deans were yanked out of
classrooms into army camps and naval stations.
ROTC men, for the ﬁrst time in history, became
respected and envied. And it was the year when
one student suggested that the senior memorial
be a plaque in honor of the first man of the class
of 1941 to be killed in \V0rld War II.

But this was not all. SFA needed and did not
get a new constitution. The News went health-
conscious and sponsored campaigns for student
hospitalization insurance and Wasserman and tu-
berculosis tests. Charley Bowser’s footballers
won three games out of eight. Men debaters
snatched their first tournament cup in years. We
got a new blue Tuck shop. And ours became the
last student body to beneﬁt from Dr. Lanfear’s
ability as dean of men; and from Miss Amos’
abilities as dean of women.

DURING THIS TIME, we of the old staff have
spent a lot of time thinking and working-—trying
to put out a live student paper.

We have tried not to make a bulletin board
out of our news pages. Campus happenings were
reflected according to what we considered Sound
editorial values. Our policy in editorials and
opinion columns——if this policy is capable of
being deﬁned--—could be described as simply an
attempt to provoke student thought. 'We like to
feel that we have succeeded here.

’_We have poked fun at ourselves and many
other things because most of us like to laugh; and
we think people should do some laughing these
days.

‘Although it l“.E.lS been one swift year for us as
editor, this was also our fourth year on the News
staff and at Pitt. Ancl the Pitt we have known
in this period  the Pitt which has come to us
through the News oiiice.

Ve learned to like this Pitt. It was some-
what different from that which we met four
years ago. It’s a more pleasant Pitt now, with
more amicable student-administration relation-
ships. Publications men and women are now
working with a deﬁnitely organized student-
iacuity publications board, instead of working
against a vague setup known only to us then
fres’..men as the “administration.”

And= as we are going to always remember this

Pitt whicii we like and which has been trans-
mitted to  through this News oflice, so will we
never forget this paper and the “draggers”: the
day and night shifts of the staff--—the typists, the
repegnrters. the proof readers, the copy editors.
', _ They have worked anonymously without
thought of personal gain or glory. Theirs has
been  quiet, undemonstrative performance, un-
appreciated by many, yet skillful and noiseless
’in_.opcration. ’

It is they who showed us that the real Pitt
spirit is not found in synthetic footbiill cheers
and beery alumni songs and faked applause at

Their spirit, or that thing which we call real
spirit. is not self-conscious. It is not dramatic.
It is not prepared.

The student with real spirit does not fit his
actions into a pre-conceived pattern; rather, it
is his action which forms the pattern of the
spirit which is Pitt’s.

Mother says Uncle Apple looked at the kitchen cal-

endar the other day. “When’s that boy comin’ home?”

he says.

Ordinarily when he wonders about Bub (me) it just
means there's another
school vacation coming up
when I’ll probably be
home for a few days. But
this time when Apple looks
at the calendar it’ll be the
last time I’ll be beatin‘ it

The four years of read-

calls it are just about over.

to Ap just what I was doing here in Pittsburgh these
four years, and no matter what kind of explaining you
do it ends up with the same idea .just readin’,
’ritin’, and ’rithmetic only advanced!

Yet, Appie’s always been interested in this Pitts-
bun-9:h business of mine. I never go home, turnpike or
hitch, plane or train that he doesn’t ask what time I
made. how the weather was when I left: “Any snow
out that way?" . . and the condition of the crops be-
tween Harrisburg and Pittsburzih: “I'll be damn if I see
how a man gets anything outa that soil!”

The second week of our freshman year we took an
elevator to the highest ﬂoor we could (it might have
been 30). walked to 38, and then walked all the way
down to the sub-basement. Once a week,. at least,
that walk down from 38 was about all the recreation
we got after the required phys ed trek to Trees gym
was over.

We took the 38 to SB trail for the last time the
other day. The Cathedral is almost ﬁnished. The
old wooden elevator cars that used to skid to a stop,
and sometimes skid right through, are gone. The steel
superstructure for the steps has been covered by the
composition stone; the pipes and temporary electric
lines have been bricked up.

We remember a few years ago when a visiting
lecturer who had excavated at Pompeii said that noth-

ing thrilled her so much at the Cathedral of Learning '

as the color of the bricks in the unfinished rooms.
"Just like the original bricks of Pompeii!”
_ Nowadays they even paint the walls after the plaster
is put on. The “readable” green of the r:ow—be.ing-
made-.eady-for-occupancy regist1'ar’s oﬁice, 1817.

Since 1937, we’ve seen the opening of the Heinz
*"“‘d.0€-:3 the vaunted stone: the curved es‘--utchcnns of
the colleges; the stained glass windows, each pair with
the small note in the lower corner, “Charles -Connick,
(c) 193-, Boston.”

Curtain Falls

Sirce those first days we’ve seen the burnt curtain

($5,000, insured‘? not insured‘? accidental?) of Foster
memorial, and the ravages of age, or of Pitt Players,
in the hardwood floor of “Pittsburgh’s most beautiful
concert stage.”
We've liked the uncompleted corners of the Cathe-
dral. One of the greatest things we got out of our
college education was an appreciation of the archi-
tectural trades: the conversations with the German
painter, the Italian storecarver in the Chinese room.

This is where we  inclined to disagree with the
planers of the Cathedral, with the “wziit-till-it‘s—done”
;.=’roup. The beauty of the Cathedral is not in the
iizzish-ed room, the colored plaster. the rubbered ti-oar.
Rather. we feel, the beauty of the Cathedral is in the
v.'o:'k. the care, the "love" of the men who created it.

We've found it simpler to study in the unfinished
rooms. The decor in the completed rooms distracts us.
The peculiar o.:lor in the it.-rzner men’s reading room
was rot conducixe to study, We learnt in the slunlight

. ..c-.} -.o, «.;' on the Illil bac‘;< of (unused)
Alumni.

The Old and the .Vew

We’\.'c found it harder to eat in the streamlined
Tucksliops. The smoke gets in our eyes. the sweet
smell of stale coke in our nose. We remember the
days when it wasn‘t too far to walk over to Schenley
Park for a sandwich, between the ripples on Panther
Hollow lake ard the chug of the extra engine making
the grade with the BO’s freight.

We prefer Schenley park to the Cathedral lawn.
We hate to ruin the greenness of those 14 acres. Which
reminds us that they’re going through with that plan
to hold commencement on the lawn. They‘ve mounted
four large Westinghouse ﬂoods on 35 and we sat on
the Heinz chapel steps the other evening reading
economics by the lights. But we want to know how
it can be arranged to seat the supposed 9,000 on that
lawn without tiers for the guests.

And when we asked a buildings and grounds man,
he said. “You don’t want people to cry at commence-
ment."

Which doesr.‘t make sense.

In the Mail

Editor, the Pitt News:

Our country is infested with inany
kinds of Fil'th—columni-.:;ts and so-
boteurs. The most diingerous of
these is the sx.vaggei‘ing egotistical.
blundering idiot of a citizen wio
goes about making a lot of noise
by running down government en-
terprise essential to national de-
tense!

It seems we have a little sopho-
more at Pitt who thinks he knows
more about the requirements for an
ofﬁcer than General lvlarshull Lind
all the other generals of our army.
Perhaps Fredie can tell us where
we could get 55.000 oﬁicers to train
our draftees if the President had
agreed xvith his crack-brain idea of
abolishing‘ the ROTC.

O Marines Use Heads

When a man joins the Marines.
he is taught to use his head. It
takes longer for some men to learn
to think than it does for others. The
average recruit can begin to reason
things out in about three months.
And you, Fredie——t'our years and
you haven't learned yet. Why not
try another four‘? Then, perhaps
you’ll be able to come to the conclu-
sion that it’s best not to go blowing
off about things until you know
something concerning them.

General Hestor says, “With the
passage of time, the War depart-
me-nt is realizing more fully the
value as Reserve Ofﬁcers of ROTC
graduates. They have demonstrat-
ed beyond a doubt what they can
do. They are living up to expecta-
tions and even more.” Of course he
is only a brigadier general. Freddie,
and you were an enlisted man for
four years. But don’t you think he
ir-ight know, shall we say, a little
more than you do? Think it over.’

Even on t.he Pitt News, a sportswriter is bound to remember
a the things after four years’ work. He winds up four years with
a q‘oee1' jumble of meinoi-les—people, incidents, big occasions, dull
days, exciting days, and a great many days that were just ordina.r_v.

We sat down the other day and tried to pick out our most vivid
nieinories, and we found just a jumble, with no semblance of order,
the important and the unimportant standing side by side.

We remembered people most often, people like Jimmy Hagan,
Frank Carver, I)oc ' Carlson, Joe and Frank K1-istiifek. (‘harley

DTD’s Upset Undefeated Fijis;
Deadlock Results in IF League

Delta Tau Delta's mushball team came through with the biggest
surprise of the season last week when they tumbled the Phi Gamma Delta
squad from the ranks of the unbeaten by the score of 9-8.

This defeat knocks the Fijis into a tie for first place with the pow-
erful Phi Epsilon Pi nine. Previous to this game with the Delts, the Phi

Gam had undisputed ﬁrst place po-
sition, arid the title practically in
their laps.

The Fijis took the lead in the
opening innings behind the steady
pitching of Bill Colvin, but a com-
plete breakdown of their defense
put the Delts into the lead which
they never relinquished.

The Phi Garns tried hard to come
back in the late innings as they hit
the offerings of the Delt pitcher,
Jim Clawes, consistently, but this
was one day that Lady Fortune did
not chose the Fijis to win,

Today the Phi Gamma Delta
team plays the second place Phi
Kappa team, who is leading a ter-
riﬁc pace at the present time. The
Phi Kap’s main line of defense lies
in their strong-armed pitcher, Mike
Sotack, while the Phi Gams will
probably use Bill Colvin in an
effort to remain in their uncertain
first place position.

The Phi Eps tee off against the
Pilams tomorrow at 3 o'clock in
hopes of adding to their already im-
pressive record of 7 victories and
one defeat. Batteries for the Phi
Eps should be Jay Silverberg and
Arnv Biron, while the Pilams will
use ‘Marty Faberman and Don Dur-

present time is their contest with
the Pi Kappa Alpha team tomor-
row at 3 o'clock.

Davis will probably take the

round against the Saminies while

old, reliable “Red” Silverman
should carry the load for the SAM
team.

Lambda Chi Alpha and SAE
will tangle for the also-ran title at
3 o'clock. The Lambda Chi’s are
leading the cellar teams with no
victories against 7 losses. and the
SAE team should not have too much
trouble tomorrow.

Pitt N etmen Meet
Indiana Teachers

Rained out and rescheduled for
today, the tennis match between
Indiana State Teachers college and
Pitt will be played on the Trees
courts at 3:30 o'clock.

The Panther netmen have shown
steady improvement in each suc-
ceeding encounter this season. A
victory over the highly-touted In-
diana squad is not too improbable.

Playing in their usual slots for
the Panthers will be Goehring,
Trimble, Gaenger, Nickeson,
Grance, and Reese. Grance and
Reese, two ﬁrst year men, have
surprised even the most optimistic
observer with their outstanding
play and consistent winning this
year.

All committee reports for the
year's activities v.rcre read at the
meeting. The yearly report of the
book exchaizge, one of the projects
of the council, showed that tho serv-

Otlzer reports were pre-:~cnted on
freshman orientation. the tea dance.

ly organized Bridge club. It was
decided to promote this club again
next year.

Most important project. accord-
ing to Parke, is to promote a stu-
dent-faculty committee for all
University athletics. The proposal
is designed to place students on the
present faculty committee on ath-
letics. to give the student body a
direct voice in formulating an ath-

no dcﬁnIt,e<resu1ts, but new mem-

Seniors Lose Title
To First Year Coeds

In a somewhat belated run-off of
the Spring Festival women's sports
program, the freshmen women cap-
tured the cup in the third annual
interclass sports event held Thurs-
day and Friday afternoons in the
Cathedral gym.

Volleyball was the only one of
the five contests scheduled to be
run off, and the winners were ad-
judged on the basis of their scoring
in this sport. The mushball, tennis,

archery, and badminton tourna-
ments were cancelled.
In a very heated contest, the

freshmen defeated last 'year’s-vic-
tors, the seniors, by a score of 19
to 13.

Gunther Leads Team

The elimination games were held
Thursday afternoon. In the first
game, the seniors won a decisive
victory over the juniors by a score
of 31 to 8. The freshman then de-
feated the sophn..1ores, the score
being 24 to 19.

The deciding game was held on
Friday afternoon with the freshman
emerging victorious.

The fourteen lreshman women
who participated in the volleyball
contest will each receive a 4-inch
blue felt letter “P” at 12:30 o'clock
in the women's gym. Delores
Acker, Ed42, newly-elected presi-
dent of WAA and chairman of the
sports events, will make the pre-
sentations.

The freshmen, victors in the vol-
leyball contest, had the largest
number of repi'e;-zentatives present
for the deciding event.

i‘-Iida Jane Gunther, acting cap-
tain for the freshmen, will accept
the cup for her class. Honorary
captain for th. freshmen was Mrs.
Helen Howard Downs.

Continuing their mastery in in-
tramural athletics, the Phi Gams
easily captured the annual frater-
nity track meet last Thursday on
the Stadium track. The Walling-
ford street speedsters took ﬁrst in
every event except the 220 yard
dash in which they placed second.
When the day was over they had
amassed a total of 62%, points, far
ahead of the second place PiKA
runners, who had only 131:’; P0im5-

Just as the Phi Gams were the
outstanding entry as a unit, so
Fiji Bobby Thurbon was the indi-
vidual star. Thurbon captured the
100 yard dash, broad jump, hop,
step, and jump, and gave his mates
a good lead as he ran lead off in
the 440 yard relay. However, in
the hop, step, and jump, he was
disgualiﬁéd because he had al-
ready participated in three events.
Nevertheless, Phi Gam Bobby
Thurbon was the “star of the day.”
Dead Heat

The best event of the meetms
the 440 yard relay in which the
Fijis really showed their heels to
the ﬁeld, winning by 15 yards. Be-
sides the aforementioned Bob Thur-
bon, Bruce Reuter, Johnny Bitner,
and Earl Pressell made up the quar-
tet that outdistanced the rest of the
ﬁeld. Reimer, I-Iasler, Black, and
Robinson of the Phi Delts puffed
in second, but were far behind the
Phi Gam's time of 48.9.

Coming out of nowhere, “Whitey”
Carlson. PiKA's star athlete, man-
aged to ﬁnish in a dead heat with
“Buzz” Updegraff of the Fijis in the
440 yard dash. The time for this
5’-‘Fueling affair was 56.6.

Bud Hawkins Comes Through

Thurbon won the 100 yard dash
in 10.3, followed close behind by
teammate B.ruce Reuter. Wilt of
the SAE’s was third. Pressell, Bit-
ner, Potter, and Warne kept the
ball rolling for the Fijis as they

Tartan Coeds Win
Acher/y Tourney

For the third successive year,
the ’I‘echites won the Intercollegiate
archery tourrament and took the
cup for permanent possession to
their trophy den across the hollow.

Coeds from Pitt, Tech, and PCW
participated in the close rivalry in
the tournament held on the Cathe-
dral lawn on Wednesday afternoon.

Libby Diebel, of Carnegie Tech,
claimed the highest score for the
day- with a total of 178 points.

inal scores for the three schools
were Carnegie Tech, 935; Pitt, 763;
and PCW, 488.

Faculty Squad Nlulees A unual
A ttempt to Bea t it! i tterlingm on

They teach English, they teach
political science, they teach math-
ematics, but it seems that the Pro-
fessors just never learn. Tomor-
row afternoon, a group of the teach-
ers will momentarily trade their en-
cyclopedias and grade sheets for
some stoved ﬁngers, a charley house
or two and many other of the phys-
ical misfortunes that inevitably goes
with the annual shellacking hand-
ed them by Ralph l\/Iitterling's var-
sity diamond men.

Four of the most capable muifers
in faculty baseball history will be
ducking line drives while standing
in the inﬁeld. Allan Bryson, in-
structor of mathematics, will be
watching third base. Bryson is the
only rookie on the squad, conse-
quently the honor of guarding the
hot corner goes to him.

Director of Athletics, James Ha-
gan, at short stop, plans to miss all
the grounders missed by the second
an-d third basemen. Herbert Cum-
mlngs of the Business Administra-
tion school, playing at second base,
will make sure that the Athletic
Director is able to handle his job
well.

Anything Can Happen

There is still some doubt as to
whether Howard Waite or Bill Dad-
dio, both of the athletic department.
will be at first base. The two oi‘
them always politely point at each
other, every time the subject come-s

up. Dacldio hasn't been his physical
self since he participated in last
year's faculty fracas.

Five instead of the usual number
of three players will patrol the out-
field for the teachers. That's to
distribute the tiresome duties of
chasing all of the bounding ﬂy balls.
Ben Williams, political science in-
structor, Eugene Myers of the ec-
onomics department, Dr. Davis,
physical education director, James
Potts, intramural director, and as-
sistant football coach, Dick Fuller-
ton, are scheduled to wander around
the outﬁeld.

Put Kliskey In The Game

Stoving his ﬁngers behind the
plate, will be Bob Hoel of the ath-
letic department. Applicants for
the position of backstop to the back-
stop will be given a trial today.

Starting on the mound for the
professors will be Nick Kliskey.
Just in case Kliskey runs into any
trouble Nick Kliskey will be ready
to relieve him. In other words Klis-
kev intends to ﬁght to the ﬁnish.

Only the battery of the varsity
baseball team is available. Sopho-
more Carmello Ranii is ready to
toss his curves to either Aldo Icar-
cli or Bob Zukas.

There will be no admission charge
for the encounter, which is sched-
uled to get under way at 3:30
o'clock in the Stadium.

won the 880 yard relay in 1:41.6.
The two Wilde brothers, Gus and
Ralph, Bob Carlson, and Page of
the PiKA house took second place.

Momentarily breaking the mo-
notony of seeing the Phi Gains
break the tape ﬁrst, Harris Hawk-
ins of the Delts managed to beat
Warne of Phi Gamma Delta in the
220 yard dash. Hawkins’ time was
24.8.

Taking up where they left off,
the Phi Gains won all the remain-
ing events. Reuter pole vaulted 10
feet to beat his fraternity brother,
Potter, who came in second.

More Fijis

PiKA’s Carlson was second to
Campbell of the Fijis in the high
jump. Campbell cleared 5 feet, 8
inches.

Pressell put the shot 45 feet, 8
inches to win this event and Thur-
bon won the broad jump with his
leap of 20 feet, 3 inches.

Even a disqualiﬁcation couldn't
beat the Fijis on Thursday. In
the ﬁnal event of the meet, the hop,
step, and jump, Thurbon won, but
was disqualiﬁed for taking part in
one event too many. However,
Quick quickly came through to win
with a combined hop, step, and
jump of 37 feet, 7 inches.

Panthers Face

W&J Linksmcn
At Wash'ingto11

Pitt's golf squad will try to fat-
ten its record this afternoon at
Washington, Pa., by stepping over
the .500 mark and the W. & J. golf
team.

The Prexies, long a power among
the little schools, won the Alle-
gheny College invitational tourna-
ment last year and were expected
to cop the title again in matches
which began last Friday.

After dropping a  to 3% deci-
sion to Carnegie Tech early in the
season, W. & J. invited the Tartans
to Washington, Pa., last Monday
and slapped them with a 7-2 defeat.
_ But despite, consist-cnt Wash-Jeff
improvement and the Proxies strong
record on their home coiirse, Pitt
should take today's match and boost
their season's record to five wins
and four defeats.

A victory this afternoon and an-
other against Navy on Saturday
would give Pitt its best golf record
in three years. Recent Panther golf
squads have persisted in remaining
below the .500 mark and below six
victories per season.

With seniors Bob Seybold and
Jack Glenn reaching top form as
they near the end of their college
careers, Pitt should be ‘tough enough
all along the line to prove to the
Red and Black that they should
have stayed in their own league.

Newest big gun for Pitt is soph-
omore Bob Walkinshaw, whose sud-
den spurt picks up the Panther
prospects considerably for next
year. Along with Walkinshaw,
sophomore ﬂash Harry Simpson,
and juniors Jim Butcher and Jim
Rees will be back in '42 for an-
other crack at collegiate golfing
glory.

Mellon Institute Head

Delivers Boston Talk

Dr. E. R. Weidlein, director of
Mellon institute, spoke on “Chem-
istry in Defense and Recovery” in
Boston before a meeting of the Re-
search Day association last Friday.

A member of the Office of Pro-
duction Management, Dr. Weidlein
will spend tomorrow and Wednes-
day in Washington as chief of the
chemicals, drugs, and allied products
section to advise and give aid in
the defense program.

_H'er‘e?It‘—Is -:9 . . .

The constitution was adopted in
1926 and revised in 1933. The
present assembly believes that a
revision is necessary to bring the
association into closer contact with
-‘students in the college. The in-
tended revision, as drawn up by the
officers and the cabinet, will be pre-
sented for approval before the fac-
ulty advisers and if successful, it
will go into effect immediately next
fall. .

Hughes has called a meeting of
officers and cabinet members for
3:30 o’clock today in 828 Cathedral
for the purpose of deciding upon
committees for next year. Chair-
men for these committees will be
appointed from among the cabinet
members.

The College association dance
scheduled for Friday, May 23 has
been cancelled, according to
Hughes. Plans are already in
progress, however for the associa-
tion Kick Off dance, which will
be the first University social event
of the school year next fall.

Officers of CA besides Hughes
are vice—president, Robert Davis,
C43; secretary, Alice Lewis, C42;

Law School

.,>:.._

' Continued from page one

justed calendar will make it possi-
ble for entering students to begin
their study of law at the beginning
of any term. ‘

Under the old rules, students
could begin only at the opening of
the regular school year. Students
in the School of Law whose study
is interrupted by draft call may
resume courses without any loss of
academ"c standing or time.

Revised Curriculum
In making the changes, the law
faculty ‘believes that at the be-

_ ginning of any term it is possible

for a student on the draft rolls to
determine whether his number is
subject to ‘call within two months,
in which case he will be able to
start or continue his law school
work for at least a term.

Under the present curriculum, in
which s-ome courses extend
throughout the full school year
with a single ﬁnal examination,
there is a natural hesitancy to be-
gin or to continue law study if in-
duction call is anticipated at any

‘ time duririg the school year, Dr.

Gilmore pointed out. This may re-
sult in an interruption of legal
studies which extends over prac-
tically two years. The revised cur-
riculum limits the interruption to
a maximum period of a few days
over a year. ' A
Deferment Eligibility

Dr. Gilmore also emphasized the
fact that in regard to deferment,
any school or college man is eligible
for deferment. A recent report
mentioned only such students as
those in chemistry, physics, and the
like, but they served only as an
example of student deferment.

Under instructions from the na-
t.onal selective draft board, local
draft boards are authorized to
grant a 60-day postponement of
the induction of a registrant in case
an immediate induction would
cause unusual hardship. They are
also authorized to grant a further
postponement for 60 days upon
good cause being shown. Accord-
ing to a statement from the na-
tional draft board, unusual hard-
ship is interpreted to be, among
other things, a sudden interruption
in the school work of a student.
