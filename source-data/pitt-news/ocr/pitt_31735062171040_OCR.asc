Posvar Presents '73-'74 Budget in

by SHARON SEXTON
Editor-in-Chief

HARRISBURG~In his 1973-74
budget presentationgto the Penn-
sylvania House Appropriations
Committee on Thursday.~Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar stated that
"the University faces funding
problems of unprecedented sever-
ity in our relationship with the
Commonwealth."

Posvar. along with several vice-

chancellors. faculty. and student a

representatives. was in Harris-
burg to impress upon the com-
mittee that the Governors stand-
still budget of $46.5 million. the
same as last years. could not
meet the University's urgent fi-
nancial needs. Posvar proposed a
budget allocations of $51 .luu.u00.

“A ‘standstill’ budget, in effect,
represents a decrease in avail-
able funding because of inflation
and other rising costs. Whatever
limited flexibility we might have
had in the past to cope with cut-
backs in state funding has been
virtually eliminated for us this
year by serious financial shock:
drastic and mostly unexpected
cutbacks in federal funding for

' health, education, and commun-

ity service programs.”

Posvar estimated the federal
cutbacks as exceeding $5 million
for next year from a, total of ap-
proximately $305.

The differential between Gov-
ernor Shapp's proposed budget
and Pitt‘s request is—$5.624.000.

Posvar maintains that this in-
crease over the 1972-73 allocation
can be accounted for by: It cost-
ot-living wages and salary in-
creases at a total of $3.7 million.
and. 2) other increases for 15:73-7-l
due to inflation and mandated
costs at a total of $l.900.000.

Posvar stated that the increase
of $3.7 million is critical for com-
pensation of University faculty
and teaching-support staffs.’ Pos-
var claims statistics show Pitt’s
faculty salaries continue to be

less than competitive among-

_other universities.

Pitt salaries will be frozen at
their current level if the budget
request in not met.

Posvar outlined several /steps
which the University is undertak-
ing to tighten its belt.

The Chancellor has asked that
all departments within the Uni-
versity prepare a budget at 94 per
cent, based on the current allo-
_cation of University funds. Pos-
var hopes to use this money to
compensate for the loss in feder-
al funds. I

Several new programs. includ-
ing the Freshman Studies Pro-
gram will be delayed.

In addition. in—state tuition will
increase next year from $970 to
$1.000. Posvar said that the Uni-
versity was hesitant to adopt this
increase. "Tuition at Pitt’ is al-
ready higher than Penn State and
Temple..the other two state-re-
lated universities. We have statis-

tics which show that Pitt's high-
er tuition rates are driving away

. the middle income student."

Posvar maintains, “These in-
creases threaten the very concept
of low-cost, publically supported
higher education.”

POSVAR employs economy meas-
ures. Photo by Mark Sussman

Theavailabiligty of state funds
to increase the budget depends on
the outcome of a general fund ap-
propriation bill. Even if the bill is
passed it is questionable as to
whether or not Pitt will get the
money requested. _ .

Budget Secretary Charles Mc-
Intosh said the administration has
other priorities. specifically. care
for the aged and the mentally re-
tarded.

concluded the evening. "

After Posvar’s remarks, most
questions _ from the committee
concerned the Pitt Medical School

and its inability or unwillingness.

to enroll more students.

The legislators. responding to
their constituents‘ demands for
better primary care. pressed Dr.
Donald N. Medearis. Jl‘.. dean of
Pitt’s Medical School. for an-
swers to their questions about the
medical school. the enrollment of
foreign students. and the accusa-
tions that the American‘ Medical
Association (AMA) has attempt-
ed to limit the number of medical

students in order to increase the

demand for doctors and thus en-
able doctors to charge higher
fees.

Medearis admitted that one
could easily document this inten-
tion on the part of the AMA with
minutes of their meetings during
the 1930's and 1940s. He said.
however. that this was no longer
the case.

Medearis said 136 students were

arrisburg  

admitted last September to the.
freshman class. This is the larg-
est class Pitt has ever had.

Medearis also told the commit-‘
tee that out of the 103 students
that graduated from Pitt last
year. 69 remained in Pennsyl-
vania to perform their internships.

Medearis anticipates that the
need for doctors which we are ex-
periencing now will be met within
the next five years. due to the in-.*
crease in medical schools. the in-
crease in the size of individual
classes. and the better distribul-=
tion of already existing doctors. _

   

Chairman of the Committee"
Rep. H. Jack Seltzer, R-Lebanon”
County, assured Pitt officials that,
the budget would not be cut fur-’'
ther. He did suggest how_ the Uni-
versity could balance the_new"-
budget without the requested
state aid. .‘3 -/2 ‘ y_

AF T Supports Faculty

In Unionization Effort

by DAVE MAJERNIK
The American Federation of 'l‘eachers (AFT: has pledged to sup-
port the Pitt Professional L'nion iPPL't. the faculty group organizing

for collective bargaining. ,
According to PPLZ President I)r.

Van Beck Hall. History. who met

Tuesday with a representative of the state organization. the AFT has.
promised to give the PPC staff help and organizational advice.
“We are still not an AFT local,” said Hall, “but eventually we will

be.”

lfall pointed out that if the PPLI joined the AFT it would be inde-
pendent of other locals. like Al Fondy's Pittsburgh Federation of
Teachers. and would maintain a great deal of local authority in terms

of bargaining.

The .»\I“'I‘ is also the bargaining unit for the faculty at Allegheny

County Community College. he said.

The faculty in the Provost's area is the main target of PPU organ-
izing plans, according to Hall. He did not rule out the faculty in the
health-related fields, but said they are “a different type of faculty.”

The inclusion of the health professions faculty into the bargain-
ing unit., said Hall. would depend on the interest by faculty members
there and the decision of t_lic State Labor Board. In the case of Tem-

ple Lniversity.

liowever. the Labor
(ﬂrintitimkrl on l‘a_(/é 3)

Board ruled against the inclusion

State's attorney Tom Bui‘ke.g‘
said the only reason given for mt:-:.,
decision not to appeal was that it]
was decided “the cost factor no ‘
longer made it worthwhile." ‘

The company was fined for aniii. 
unreported oil» spill at its Home.-.
stead Works last April on thel_
basis of “citizens’ evidence” pre-
sented under the Clean Stream:
Law by Environment: Pitts”-'
burgh. ‘ A y

The state's attorney said he i
found U.S. Steels last minute
change of mind "very surpris-
ing." and recognized some room I
in the case foran appeal. I 
’ Burke also said. "The fine;

viction under the Clean Stream“.
Law and under its provisions.‘ a...
second offense within two. years,§
will make the company liable for-,__

David Marshall, coordinator off .
Environment: Pittsburgh, con-
jectured that the underlying rea-''.’’
son why U.S. Steel reversed its u
decisions could be that “the com-_ 
pany did not want to be dragged \ 7
through the mire of publicity
again.” 
Marshall added that his groupi,_
would be "redoubling its efforts," V
to find a second violation of the
Clean Stream Law by the compa-
ny within the two year period. and
said. "No doubt. there will be sev-
eral." ' " '

By Saturday afternoon, the two
major powers deleted internal

strife, while Wombat conquered-

Laulicht indicated that the slin-

demonstrate how nations interact
with one another under strained

,conditions.

The University Placement Serv-

The Center has affiliations with

large and small, local and nation-

Summer contracts with such
national companies, explained
Rush, do not pay a lot of money,

because it gives the chance to get

April to mid-June is the biggest

time for students to look for jobs.
Rush offered this advice:
. 1. Look around your hometown
area for places hiring seasonal
help. Tourist facilities and amuse-
ment parks have low pay and long
hours but do providesome jobs.

2. Go to small companies inter-
ested in hiring one or two ein—
ployees to fill in for vacationing
secretaries or laborers." Stay
away from large department
stores which do not increase sum-
mer business.

3. Dress well and be prompt for
interviews.

The next’ step. which will begin
this week. is 10 dis'.ribuii- au-
thorization cards to the faculty.
said Hall. If 30 per cent sign these
cards. he said. then the PPL can
go before the Labor Board and de-
bate over the appropriate bar-
gaining unit.

“We plan toipush the cards on
a face to face basis,” said Hall.

The third step. said Hall. would
be an election to decide which or-
ganization will represerit the fac-
ulty. Then the elected group would
work out a collective bargaining
contract with the administration.
he said.

The fulfillment of these objec-

.tives is "not around the corner."

admitted Hall.

Hall said he has been in contact
with the administration through
Dr. David Powers of the Chancel-
lor’s office. Hall believes the ad-

' ministration does not like the for-

mation of faculty union and will
probably fight it, but he does not
foresee any “general nastiness”
and anticipation “a debate or a
very high level.” _. '

  Column and A Half

by JOHN METCALFE

l have been following the United Nations delib-
erations on the status of Panama and the Canal Zone
with a good bit of interest. Even before the meet-
ing convened. I sensed that it was ‘quite likely‘ that
even more idiocy than is"the norm for UN activ-
ities might be expected from this particular gather-
ing. 1 was right. '

Themeeting was held in Panama. presumably‘
to insure that -the deliberating body would be truly"
neutral and isolated from the emotional distrac-
tions of local issues and the possible manipulation
of local populations in order to sway the tone and
content of discussions.

In addition, it freed the United States from the
embarrassing" necessity of making statements
which might be'interpreted in some quarters as
threats. In New York it is often the sadduty of our

wdelegate to inform other delegates that they would
I be well advised to express their opinions at the air-

port, and then leave immediately. Otherwise, it
would be impossible to guarnatee their safety.

It must be clear toall thinking persons that a
country which is unable to assure the safety‘ of its

guests is a poor choice as a host.

ln Panama the ideals of the United i\’ations
were vindicated. No nation or group of nations
sought advantage at the expense of others. 1 here
was none of the jockeying for flashy" headlines
which so often mars debate in the New Stork offices
‘of the organization. Delegates could walk the
streets with confidence; muggings areas rare as
revolutions in Panama. V

Reasonaxly enough, the United States was or-
deredto give up all claims to the Canal, which the .
United States built, and to the Zone, which runs
through the sovereign ‘state of Panama, which the
United States invented. '

The United States declined. l
'l he USSR. which invented the veto. objected
to the use of its invention by‘ the United States.
Panama expressed concern over the physical
and mental health of the representative of the
United States. '
A tuba. _\1ll‘pl'l.\lIlgl\'. took sides agains; her i.ear—
esf and largest neighboi.
l5ritain abstained. Abstentioii is a method of
making an event out of inaction.

And now the United Nations is on its way back
to the dangers of New York City without the satis-
faction of having accomplished anything’ on the vital
question of Isthmal Colonialism.

Apparently nobody at the meeting in Panama
had access to a lllSt0f‘_\' book. If any one had remem-‘
bered to bring one. the whole ‘congregation would
have learned that Panama only exists as the re-
sult of a revolution early in this century. largely",
sponsored by the United States. There is clear evi-
dence that imperialism was at work. and that the
Canal is the father of Panama. not the child as the
simple—minded may imagine.

\ou can see that I do own a history book/. and
have been reading it. In the light of the real facts
of the case. I can see only one solution to the dilem-
ma of the Canal. the. Zone. and Panama.

The United States ‘should expunge every trace
of its colonial adventure; pave or otherwise elim-
inate the Panama Canal, clear out of the Zone, and
return the entire so-called nation of Panama to
Columbia.

This will eliminate at least oneyestige of col-
onialism from Central America. and retur_n a po-
tentially useful property to its rightful owner. ’

I will not expect any fee from the United lVa—
tions for this respectfully submitted solution.

ter inouiring about their particu-
lar reasons for waiting to see Mr.
X. l iound I was not alone in my
situation. As the office door
opened. l\«ll'. X emerged and was
astounded by the number of stu-
dents waiting to see him.

Mr. X then inquired if any of
us wanted to see him about Econ.

while ‘Mr. X explained “en
masse” to the group that there
was no possible way that he could
admit any of us into his class. He
further explained thathe wanted
the class to be kept small, and
that it was the administrations’
fault for not offering another 82
course. Rejected and-defeated, I
decided to substitute another
course in its place and figured I
would try again next term.

As registration began a few

went to see Mr. X. After trying

with an apology‘ this time saying
that someone had to get screwed.

cester. l\"iéJ.\'S.. he writes about his
boyhood there in the poem The
Testing Tree in his latest book. of
the same name. and now spends a
lot of time on Cape Cod. The rural
influence can_be seen in his poe-
try. iie eirioys yvoi'kiiig witii \\t)(itl.

Although he feels that the Pul-
itzer Prize has been his greatest
honor ‘_‘in the public sense”—he
says that the most important hon-
or of his life is “to have been loved

by people I love.”

- He considers the poets oi the
world. both pa‘-st and present. "a
big fraternity and soroi'ity'." flop-
kins. Yeats. and his friend Theo-
dore lloethke. he says. have had
strong influences on him. Ques-
tioned about the relatively small
number of-"great“ women poets
in the past. Kunitz replied that
"they didn't have the freedom to
express their feelings." Of those
women poets who have become
great. like iimily -l)ickinson.
Kunitz said that what one saw
most in tiieiii was "their strengtli
and l€I‘l‘.li)iC secrecy."

At the reading Kunitz began

with poems from his Selected
Poems. I*‘inely polished. often
about death. and love. these

poems have that Eliot-like objec-
tive distance that ciiai'acterized
Aiiioi‘icaii poetry during the per-
iod in which tiiey were written.

They are not cold or obscure
poems though, Kunitz shows,
through his clarity and his abun-
dant, striking imagery_, that his
kind of poetry is not necessarily
dry or vacuous emotionally.

One of these poems. "The Dark
and the i*‘air.“ is about meeting a
beautiful woman. a potential lov-
er. only to have the occasion ruin-

ied by haunting memories oi aii—

other. darker lover from the past.

i\’tini’/.. during the intery iew. nieiii—

tioned that two of the most mean-

ingftil lines from his poetry. for

him. are from this poem:

We learn, as the thread plays out,
that we belong

Less to what Hatters us than to
whatscars.

l<‘rom the Selected Poems, Kun-
itz went on to read some poems by
the lafussian poet Anna Akmatova
which he has recently translated.
Before he read. he dispelled the
belief that translation was a sec-
ondar_v work fora poet.

reation of oneself tiiroiigh another
person." His translated poems by
Akhiiiatova are to be published
this spring in a book called Poems
of Akhmatova.

In contrast with the public stat-
ure of poets in this country, Rus-
sian poets, Kunitz explained, are

.folk heroes, whose books sell out

immediately. They are, however,
under complete governmental cen-
sorship.

“in ittissia." he said. "they
care so much what the poet says
that iiiey censor him. Here. you
can print anything you want. btit
no one cares.

For the last of the reading.
Kunitz read fromhis latest book.
The Testing Tree. it was clear
that he is closer to these poems
than any of the others. The dis-
tance in his Selected Poems has
disappeared in this work. The
poems are touching. human. coit-
versational: remembrances of his
childhood. the fun of going to the
movies Willi‘ the German maid
Fi'ietla when he should have been
in school: the horror in "llobin
liedbreast.“ a live bird he once
found with an old. healed bullet
wound through its h‘ead: the joy of
open seaside living: the sad ll‘-
reversibility of getting old.

Some of the poems are vision-
ary, other, worldy scenes involv-
ing the mystery of artistic in-
spiration or the horror of war. In
the long poem, “Journal for My

‘Daughter,” which he read with

much emotion, he says, referring
to student unrest of the last de-
cade: “Demonstrations in the
streets/I am there not there.” 4

These poems are the epiphanies.
the cream of life lived and seen
as a poet lives and sees. What the
audience at" the Poetry‘ I*‘orum
was hearing was authentic. and
they responsed to the reading
wariiily.

At the end of my interview with
Stanley Kunitz. I asked him what
advice he would give to a young
poet. He replied: "Persist. Con-
tinue to write. Search within _vour-
self. Doirt become too literary.
it's more important to be a human
being."

He recommended gaining
“knowledge about the world. It
is vague", romatic feelings,” he
said, “that are the death of poe-
try.” He continued, “The poet

“TO [HAVE been loved by people I love . . . . .”

must nail his poems to reality.
But, one of the tricks is to make
the nails invisible”—Something
which, clearly, he has done and
which has made. his poems as
great as they are.

one-acts that opened at the Pla_\'-

bore anamazing resemblance to
an evening of Love American
Style, I still have to say "better
here than in front of the tube."
The show consisted of two coine-
dies and one ‘abstract drama.

Slide is an original script by
Craig Clinton. directed by Paul
Greeno. The piece is a suburban
romance concerning the viewing
of some slides by two married

' couples. When the hosts slides

run out. the neighbor (Fred Mc-
Carron: offers his own to round
out the night's boredom.

But somewhere along the line,
porno slides have been picked up
by mistake. No, it doesn’t turn into
a Bob and Carol and Ted and
Alice. More of a mildly erotic
Dick Van Dyke with the two prin-
cipals (Jennifer Wells and Dean
Hyland) realizing there is some-
thing missing in their marriage
and making reconciliations after
having literally floored by the
wife’s mushroom wine. . Funny?
Yes.

Each of the actors pounces on
his or her lines so that the maxi-
mum is obtained front ever_\ sit-
uation..and these come fast and
thick to a point. But. as soon as
the neighbor and his pregnant
wife (D‘arcy Webb: crawl out the
door. the play drags on into an un-
usually mundane ending.

Thats right Indiana. Pitt was
supposed l0 meet C-;\lU lot the
Commissioners Lupbut the Tar-
tans couldn't make it to the Al-
pine. as a team that is.

Carnegie-Mellon let out for
spring breaklast Wednesday and
the Tartans requested that the
date of the contest be moved back-.
claiming that they had not been
informed just when the game was
to be held. League officials didn't
buy their story. however. and

since the date for the final game
had, been made public over four

 

months ago. C-.\lU was forced to
relinquist their berth ill the finals
to liidiana. winners oi the Metro-
politan Division.

On two days notice, Indiana re-

grouped their team and arrived
at the Alpine in the place of the
Tartans, who had just defeated
them last week, 3-2, in sudden
death overtime.

For such a touch and go -aifair.
the game turned into a tootii and
nail contest. Many of the Pitt
players complained that the game
wasnt actually a test for the
championship since Indiana had
been eliminated.. l\’onetheless. the
league title was on the line and

made a last ditch attempt and
dove to knock the puck off his

around Lieberman and put the

Indiana netminder hen Hichert
made the game a little mole in-

minutes. Indiana could muster
only a half dozen pucks for Lieb-

The Gobblers weren t expected.

to suivive the opening round. and
won their games by the narrow-
est, of margins. outscoring their
opponents by a total of just four
points.

Virginia Tech opened up the
game with strong outside shoot-
ing. and quick passes to go with it.
and built up an early lead. which
reached a high of 10 points on
more than one occasion. The hot-
test shooting came from Allen
Bristow and Lraig Lider. Lid-

er finished with high scoring hon— 4

ors. hitting for 28 points.

The man who kept Notre Dame
in the/game was 6’9”, John Shu-
mate, who was named the tourna-
ment’s _most valuaxle player. In
the quarter and semifinals, the
“Big Shoe” had connected for 21
straight field goals. '

The Gobblers enjoyed the lead
for almost all the first half. but
when the Irish instituted their full

ly oit Pitt earlier in the season..

points. as Notre Dame hi. for

led the 'GUbbl€l'-S from there. At

Stevens was instrumental in

When Pitt met Indiana twice
earlier this season the results
were some hard hitting and a few
rounds of fisticuffs. When the
third period was only half over,
the brutal checking had begun to
take its toll. The Lush Line was
out and Denny Browne found him-
self crossing sticks with his “old
friend” Rearden. The two hit, the
sticks went up and suddenly ev-
eryone on the ice was running into
each other in a frantic race to

Dearsir:
I am writing in response to a
letter from one Timothy Patrick
Gorman which appeared in your
March 18 issue. It seems that the
University of Notre Dame has
come under fire recently. and I
feel that I‘m supposed to be apo-
logetic for having graduated from
there. I'm sure Gorman would
think me very progressive and en-
lightened for being able to go .from
ND to Pitt for graduate school.

The fact of the matter is. Notre
Dames only sin seems to be in
having a fine tradition and loud

' group of supporters. and lastly its
greatest transgression. winning.

The problem which seems to
have ignited the fire against ND is
that they were invited to the NIT.
Their 15-11 record is the worst of
any team invited and around
Pittsburgh it seems Duquesne
is the team most offended by this
slight. I too think the Dukes de-
served a bid but not because they
‘defeated Notre Dame. I feel both
Duquesne and Notre Dame belong
there. Any basketball fan knows
that one game in a season means
little and upsets are part of the
game.

Notre Dame defeated ’ Mar-

quette, but even an Irish chavan-
ist like myself wouldn’t consider
Notre Dame as NCAA material.
Notre Dame plays one of the best
basketball schedules in the coun-
try, and defeated St. John’s, Mar-
quette, and South Carolina. Notre
Dame deserves to be in the NIT,
an objective look will reveal that.
Had Notre Dame played Du-
quesne’s schedule, it‘ is unlikely
that the Irsh would have lost
more than eight or nine games.

As to Notre Dame being a rac-
ist institution. Im not too sure the
facts are straight. The last time
Notre Dame voted not to go to a
bowl. it may. very well have been
that the reason was because the
football team did not want the
proceeds to go to a minority
scholarship fund. I doubt it. Notre
Dame voted not to go to a minor
bowl. The fact that_because Notre
Dame did not go. the minority
scholarshp fund suffered may be
true but the scholarship fund was
not the only reason the Irish did
not go (if indeed it was any part
of the reason at all). Even so.
does the action of the football
team 1100 men at most) make the
whole institution 17.000 under-
graduate) racist‘? Idoubt it.

Anyone watching Notre Dame
football will also tell you that Tom
Clements is a superior football
player to Cliff Brown. Color has
nothing to do with it.

Gorman’s hope that Notre Dame
got destroyed in the NIT (they
didn’t) and never win another
football game (impossible) is
said. It’s too bad he can’t be for
something instead of against. It’s
easy to be against. Cheer for
somebody Gorman.

Finally. Notre Dame is a fine
academic institution with a long
history of high selectivity in its
students and faculty. Football is
not the only game in town. From
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. presi-
dent. on down. Notre Dame has
nothing but the finest people con-
nected with it. In that respect it's
about the same as Pitt. Incident-
ly. Fr. Hesburgh was chairman of
the Civil Rights Commission un-
til early this year when he pub-
licly criticized Richard Nixon and

was askedfor a resignation. Sort .

of an unlikely head for a racist in-
stitution. don’t you think‘?

Grow up Gorman. there's more
to life than football. basektball.
and being critical without knowing

Irish’ Only Sin Is Winning

the facts. If you don’t like Notre
Dame find out some real reasons.
I was there for four ‘years and be-
lieye me. there are plenty. none
of which you mentioned.
At the risk of being like you.
