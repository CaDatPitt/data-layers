Author Maya Angelou sang, recited poetry and spoke in the student union last night.

Angelou urges exploration
of black literature, culture

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Through song, poetry and her skill for
conveying memories, author Maya Angelou paid
tribute to the indomitability of the black spirit
and the richness of black heritage.

. . ‘,‘Go to the documents and see how it is,” she

said, challenging the audience to delve into their
family and literary heritages. '

As part of Black Week Angelou, also a poet,
actress and playwright, addressed a packed
William Pitt Union Assembly Room last night.
The audiencecheered, called out “That’s right,”
laughed often and gave Angelou three standing
ovations. '

“Look where we’ve all come from,” Angelou
sang .in a lustrous, deep voice, and urged an
understanding of the past.

“I don’t think young men and women will be
as apt to run to drugs, madness in any of its
forms, if they knew that they have been loved ...\

If they don’t know that, they’ll never survive,”
she said.

Blacks have successfully struggled to survive
despite the wretchedness of slavery, she said.
“Miraculously they stayed alive. They paid for us
 Having had everything thrown against us,
here we are upwards of 40 million. I know
people who swear there are more than 40
million black people in the Baptist church,” she
said. . ‘ A :

It's important that people look for role models
in their own families and communities, not “to
some mega-star who doesn’t care if you live‘ or
die." Family members shouldn’t be‘ ignored
because they “split infinitives 
wrong clothes." '

Hearing the black voice expressed through

hundreds of years of writing is the key to
establishing an identity, she said. Angelou stressed
over and over the importance of reading.
“You must use the library,” Angelou

Vendor settles Pitt suit

By Megan Bertino
News Editor

He painted “PITT” on his truck,
and now he has to pay for it —

- $5,000.

Charles Bonasorte, owner of
the outdoor vendor on the corner
of Bigelow and Forbes, will no
longer be allowed to use the
letters “PITT” to advertise his
Pittsburgh Stop phone number.

Bonasorte must also pay the

university $5,000 for legal fees in
a case decided Friday in U.S.
District Court.

“I think Pitt won fair and
square,” Bonasorte said. “I’m OK
with the fact that I lost. I took my
best shot.”

Bonasorte said he did not
realize he violated a law when he
painted the number 422—PI'IT on

his truck, which is usually parked _

in frontvof the Cathedral of
Learning, “l‘PITT’] are the first
letters of my lcompany’sl name.”

Pitt filed charges against

Bonasorte in October 1990,
claiming that his phone number
can mislead customers into
thinking that Bonasorte is affliated
with the university.

The court ruled that using  ‘S

“-PITT” was using Pitt’s name and
was misleading.

Bonasorte said he was not trying
to mislead customers and does
not want to be associated with

the university-owned store, The

Pitt Shop.

“I don’t want‘ to be related to
the university. There’s a lot of
animosity toward Pitt,” he said. “I
want the students to know I have
nothing to do with Pitt.”

Although Bonasorte is not
affiliated with Pitt, he said he

pays the university a 7-percent .

royalty for all products with the
school logo.

Bonasorte said he was not bitter A I I,

about losing to the university, but
he is angry that Pitt initially asked
for $19,800 in legal fees.

Vandalism often leads

to elevator brealedowrzs

difficult to control the vandalism I

By Michael Lowe
Staﬂ“ Writer

Super-glued buttons, smashed
control panels, broken locks and
burning trash cans are some of
the many unusual problems that
occur on campus elevators.

These problems, classified by
facilities management as
“vandalism,” often lead to elevator
breakdowns —— which lead to
headaches for people who have
to wait for a working elevator.

The biggest problem area on
campus is the residence halls-,
according to Gordon Bugby,
senior engineer at facilities
management.

“Any place where people come
and go a lot, people seem to take
out their frustrations on the first
thing they see, " Bu gby said. .“And
since a lot of people don’t have a
car that they can kick the tire,
sometimes they kick the elevator.”

According to Bugby, it is

because it is hard to apprehend
the person or persons involved.

“We haven't tried any major
investigation because it is futile,”
Bugby said.

There are 121 elevators at the
university. Maintenance is
contracted to four different com-
panies with an annual price tag
of $812,000 for regular upkeep,
roughly $6,000 an elevator.

But, vandalism is not covered
by these contracts. For every

elevator that is broken by.

“excessive enthusiasm,” more

money has to be spent to repair’
it. Elevator maintenance can then —
reach close to $1 million a year. .

“I come back from every
weekend, andl hear about a new

adventure with the elevators,”

said Carol Landos, sales
representative for Schindler
Elevators, one of the four
companies contracted to repair
campus elevators.

Award-winning author continues

The phrase “crime against nature” has
two different meanings for writer Minnie
Bruce Pratt. These words represent the
Alabama statute under which she would
have faced criminal prosecution for being
a lesbian if she would have fought for
custody of her children.

CrimeAgaz'rzstNature, which focuses on
her being forced to give up her two sons,
is also the title of her 1989 Lamont Poetry
Selection by the Academy of American
Poets.

Pratt was on campus yesterday to talk
about censorship and to read excerpts

from her latest book of essays, Rebellion.

Her work has been called obscene by
many, including Sen. Jesse Helms from
South Carolina, because of her openness
about her homosexuality.

Helms is known for his attempts to
withdraw funding from the National
Endowment for the Arts. Pratt spoke of the
attempt by the right wing to gain control
over arts funding as “a kind of spiritual
attack.”

She said the Lamont Award ceremony
held at the Guggenheim Museum in New
York where she received the Lamont
Award was discouraging because of the
reaction of the two Chancellors from the
Academy of American Poets, who sat on

stage with her.

While Pratt was explaining the cultural
foundations of her poems to the audience,
she was asked to sit down by the two men,
even though she had taken no more time
than any other speaker, she said. They
passed her notes and interrupted her

while she was in the middle of one of her V

poems.

“Their actions made it clear they were .

not ready to deal with me or my work. It
was very hard to keep reading.”

She said she feared she would be
physically assaulted by the men when she
did not stop reading. “That wasn’t the first
time I felt like someone might hit me
[because of my beliefsl.”

to battle discrimination

Her writing continues to win national
and international awards.

In 1991, she was chosen with two other
lesbian writers to receive a Hellman-
Hammett award from the Fund for Free

Expression. This award is given to writers‘

“anywhere in the world who havebeen
victimized by political persecution.”

She also received the Creative Writing
Fellowship in Poetry from the National
Endowment for the Arts in 1990. _

Pratt was born in Selma, Ala., in 1946.
She received her bachelor's degree with
honors from the University of Alabama in
1968, and her doctorate in English literature
from the University of North Carolina in
1979. l

 

 

For The PM News

Vibrant colors and tempting
aromas drew students into Forbes
Quad yesterday to the Black
Bazaar, part of the celebration of
Black Week, sponsored by the

5 Black ‘Action Society.-

“The black bazaar shows how
diverse black people are. Blacks
tend to be stereotyped in America
as one group," said Kelly Abbey,
a vendor at the fair. “We aren't all
-followers of any one thing.”

Send-e Kenderson, a student at

9 8‘ Pitt who displayed her poetry

‘depicting the black struggle, said
the fair “makes students more
aware of the black culture and
identity. I think black students
have a loss of identity, and this

»  shows we are a part of creativity

and expression."

Students could purchase
African food, jewelry, art and
clothing at the fair.

“I think it’s great. Black
businesses can come and exhibit

their products, and we can sell
and buy to one another. It’s
beautiful,” said }oAnn Thomas,
editor of the BAS’ Blacleline
journal.

“[The bazaar] gives students an‘

opportunity to learn about
different cultures and
nationalities, and out of
knowledge you can learn respect.
People get to congregate and
become aware of other cultures,”
said Patricia Lyman—Seck, a
businesswoman who imports
goods from Africa and Third
World nations.

Many vendors said it was
important to give students role
models to follow and were more
than willing to talk to students
about business opportunities. “It
gives good role models to
students, shows them how to be
self-producing. They can learn
how to enter the business world,”
clothing vendor Robert Lee Bey
commented.

Angelou

Continued from page 1

commanded. “Encourage the
child to use the library.”

She suggested that people go
to their librarians and say, “Excuse
me, Ms. Angelou mentioned some
poetry  and I think I need to

‘ know that poetry for myself.”

After the librarians have
recovered from shock, they “will
search throughout the state to
satisfy your request,” Angelou
said.

As a child she didn’t speak for
about five years, but said her
head was filled with the words of
James Weldonjohnson, Countee
Cullen and Shakespeare. “I loved
Poe so much I called him ‘EAP’ to
myself.”

Her grandmother would say,
“Mama love to see you reading
that poetry. Mama love it. It means
you puttin’ starch in your
backbone.” Angelou soon
realized that spirituals, gospel
songs and the preaching of the
minister on Sunday were also
“great poetry.”

“Great art belongs to all the

people all the time. T here’s no
mystery. It’s supposed to shore
you up,” she said. “I look
immediately for the literature
which tells me not only am I all
right, I am fantastic.”

“Women are so phenomenal,”
Angelou said, and sang a women’s
work song she had written which
described the never-ending cycle
of a woman’s day.

And while men are phenomenal
too, she said, “you’ll have to
write your own poem.”

Minority literature, language
and love has been historically
devalued, she said.

She sang bits of black folk
songs to disprove the fallacy that
“white people make love and
black, brown, beige and red
people have sex.”

“The woman I love is fat and
chocolate to the bone, and every
time she shakes, some skinny
woman loses her home” and
“They say the blacker.the berry,
the sweeter is the juice,” were
some of the lines.

“Now that’s romantic love

poetry and it is poetry,” Angelou
said.

She also scoffed at the common
misconception that “white people
speak languages and black,

brown, beige, red and yellow"

people speak dialects. Each
language is a language. I don’t
understand what [dialect] means.”

She spoke of black Americans’
unquenchable pride. How is it
that a third-generation welfare
recipient “can walk down the
street as if he had oil wells in his
pocket?” And to illustrate, she
strutted across the stage to wild
applause.

Angelou has won many awards —
in clu ding .

for her writing,
nomination for the Pulitzer Prize
(1 Know Why The Caged Bird
Sings) and National Book Award.

But she showed rare humility
when she told the audience she
won the Langston Hughes Prize
last week.“Can you believe it?

Me,Maya Angelou? Those people .

actually put Mr. Hughes’ name
and my name in the same
sentence!”

Inadequate advertising

When students move into the University of Pittsburgh’s
residence halls, one of the questions on the multitude of
forms they must fill out asks them if they want their phone
numbers listed in the on—campus phone listing. V

Likewise, students who live off campus have the option
of having their phone numbers and addresses published
in the white pages.

However the Student Government Board recently
published the Student Directory, which lists the school
and home addresses, complete with phone numbers, for
all Pitt undergraduates. Those listed failed to fill out a form
available to them in The Pitt News on Sept. 17 and 18 of
this year. Other, smaller ads ran for approximately two
weeks but were practically unnoticeable due to their size.

Although the legality of the directory is protected by the
Buckley Amendment of 1974, the process by which the
SGB went about gaining student participation was

I D’ inadequate.

According to Student Government Board‘ President
Brent Saunders, not only were students notified of the
upcoming directory through Pitt News ads, but forms for
those who protested the publication of their personal
information were available atvarious locations throughout
campus.

If students did not want the information printed, they
were instructed by the ads to fill out a separate form at the
Student judicial System at Room 738 William Pitt Union.
, This system is fairly reminiscent of a recent TCI cable
promotion. Consumers who did not wish to receive
Encore were told to notify TCI by mail, thereby creating
mass confusion for not only cable receivers but also
employees of the company.

When faced with the possibility that some students may
be upset that their home addresses were printed in the
directory, Erin Rodgers, the SGB member who helped to
organize the project, told The Pitt News that “The Pitt News
is a source of information, and if people don’t choose to
be informed, it’s not our responsibility.” Also claiming that
the SGB gave studentsadequate opportunity to have their
names unpublished, she said the home listings would not
endanger the safety of students.

Although The Pitt News is a source for information, it is
well known that not everybody reads The Pitt News, much
less every day. The full—page ads for the Student Directory
ran only twice.

The purpose of printing the local and permanent
addresses of students was a violation of rights. Although
there was notification that the Student Directory was
being planned, the advertising was minimal. In order to
better inform students, form letters should have been sent
to the homes of students. There are many avenues the
SGB and SA office could have followed but failed to. Pitt
students are generally apathetic, and the SGB is well
informed of this.

Hopefully, in the future, more consideration will be
given to students before the directory is printed. Director
of Student Activities Joe Cavalla said he agreed. “This is
the first time we’ve done it, and we'll double—check things
better next time,” he said. «

Time to check 01/ttofﬂotellothrop ’

Ouch! I just bumped my head
on the shelfplaced directly above
my sink. Residents of Lothrop
Hall are all too familiar with this,
while other students should be
careful the same thing does not
happen to them. This shelf is one
of the featu res of the new Lothrop
I-lall we found this year. If the
university plans to remodel the
other residence halls or build the
new dormitory this way, we
cannot stand for it.

Lothrop Hall had a new look
when I arrived in August. The
halls were transformed into an
atmosphere that evoked the title
“Hotel Lothrop. ” I had carpet and
new furniture in my room. All of
this combined looked so  nice.
I felt privileged to live in Lothrop.

This feeling was short-lived,
for Pittsburgh was soon engulfed
by stiﬂing heat. In past years,
Lothrop had large, loud, but
effective fans at the end of each
hall that created air circulation to
ease the heat. These fans were
gone and had been replaced by a
window, which while serving a
greater aesthetic purpose, did
nothing else. The fans should
have stayed.

Inside my room, the desk is a
definite problem area. The old
desks were bigger, allowing more
room for storage. My parents had
to bring out an extra table for my
room because I had no space for
my printer or my alarm clock. I
never had them on the floor
before, and I was not about to
start now. The seat at the desk

Ed
Kichline

seems like it was designed for
torture. Any little shift made while
sitting causes the chair to rock,

sometimes almost to the point of
falling. The chair has absolutely
no padding, which makes it
virtually unbearable for any length
of time. Studying becomes that
much worse when you cannot
find a comfortable place to sit.

_ '. Studying is impossible in a dark
room, which is pretty much what
I would have if I hadn't brought
two lamps of my own. The only
light the university provided for
the main part of my room was an
ancient desk lamp with no plastic
on its plug. Any timeyou plug or
unplug the light, a good jolt is
sent up your arm.‘

So my lamp is sitting in the top
shelf of my closet, along with my
shirts, my coats, my shoes, my
suitcase and my dirty clothes. But
anybody who walks by my room
will know that because there are
no. doors for my closet. As much

' as I would like to leave my room

more often, I really have no
incentive because of our lounges.
Sure, the furniture is five or six
decades better than before, but
the TVs are still the same: bad.
You practically have to be a
technician to figure out the best
way to hold the wires to get any
kind of reception.

Compared with other expenses
involved in the remodeling,
buying new TV s would have been
minor. Each lounge also has a
kitchen area, which in the past
had a stove and oven. This was
nice when you wanted to make a
meal for yourself or you had
some pizza or something you
wanted to reheat. I

The ranges are gone, leaving
nothing but a sink. We have sinks
in our rooms, complete with a
badly placed shelf. This shelf is
fine except when you want to
brush you teeth or_ wash your

‘ face. Unfortunately, I cannot think

of many other things to do at my
sink, so the shelf is pretty much a
constant problem.

However, I am less inclined to
wash my face in Lothrop these
days. The cold faucet gives cold
water, and so does the hot faucet.
This lack of hot water is an
inconvenience now, but as winter
approaches the problem will
probably become worse. I can
only hope this does not affect my
heater. I like to dream.

Indeed, when I first saw Lothrop
in August, it seemed like a dream.
The halls and rooms all had a
new look, and we were all
enraptured. But the honeymoon
is over, and Lothrop is perhaps
worse than it was before. So if
they want to remodel your hall,
or they want you to live in the
new facility, watch out.

Soccer coverage incompetent

Because my roommate is a Pitt soccer player and
I enjoy the game, I have gone to most of the
sparsely attended home games this season. That

there are few spectators does not
frustrate me nearly as much as
the incompetent reporting done
by The Pitt News. Imagine a

Haitian covering an ice hockey game, and you have

an excellent comparison.

Every article on the team was flawed. Mistakes
ranged from incorrect jersey numbers to an absolute
ignorance ofsoccer. Writers often used Telefact to

gather team information.

a football game, declaring Pitt’s poor shooting
effort cost them the game and was tantamount to
not crossing the 50-yard line. Seton Hall was

outshot by Syracuse just as badly,

yet won both the game 4-0 and

the eventual championship.
During the entire season,

rarely was mention made of MVP candidate Mike

Watson, yet goaltender Tim Sobelman received

praise in nearly every article. Was the author his

The football team gets two articles a day. The

soccer games get two a week. Make theirs count.

Pitt greases Marathon Oil in

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Marathon Oil entered
Wednesday’s game against the
Pitt Panthers with an impressive
reputation. Instead ofplaying the
classic role ofthe exhibition stiff.,
they had played their Big East
competition tough, winning one
and losing three others by a
combined total of 12 points. The
Panthers rolled to a 92-83 victory,
but they struggled a bit getting
there.

Chris McNeal led the Panthers
throughout, finishing with 29
points and 11 rebounds, while
Gandhijordan came off the bench
to add 18. McNeal and Jordan
were the only Panthers to score
in double figures.

' After the Panthers led by as
many as 21 with just over nine
minutes to play in the first half,
Marathon Oil began a run oftheir
own. Todd May, college
basketball’s all-time leading
scorer, from Pikeville College in
Kentucky, hit a three-pointer with
8:56 left in the half. Eric Turner, a
former Michigan guard, followed
with a two—point lay-in. Then

-Lem Howard, a 6—foot, 8-inch

centerout of Auburn, canned
two free throws after a foul by
Pitt’s.Chris Gant. Zane Arnold
added a short jumper to cut the
Panthers’ lead to 12 with 5:30 to
play.

The two teams traded baskets
until the 3:38 mark. After a

gave the Panthers a 16-point lead
(43-27), Dave Miller and Howard
took over for the Oilmen. With
3:21 remaining, Miller canned a
three-pointer, cutting the deficit to
13. After Mobley missed the front
end ofa one-and-one opportunity
from the foul line, Howard
responded with a three of his own
and then added a breakaway dunk
to cut the Pitt lead to six points
with 1:45 left.

Turner popped a trey with 1:13
remaining to bring Marathon Oil
within three points. McNeal
responded with a back—door hook
with 50 seconds left in the half,
providing for the -halftime margin
of 45-40.

Marathon Oil opened the second
half with a 14-8 run to take a 53-
54 lead, capped by a May jumper
with 15:08 remaining. The teams
alternated baskets until the 10:17

‘mark. At that point, with Pitt

leading by five points, Marathon
went on an 8-0 run aided by two
Panther fouls.

Pitt allowed Marathon to stay in
the game until the 4:10 mark,
when they finally put the game
away. Marathon could only
manage to score seven points in
the last four minutes to the
Panthers’ 12.

“I thought that this win gave our
kids some confidence,” said Pitt
head coach Paul Evans. “I felt
coming into this that a win would
give us some more confidence
and a loss would make us focus
more‘ on’ next week against
Manhattan.” M W 8 V‘ 8' "

thundering dunk by Eric Mobley

The Pitt News

Weldon to wax Miami

Our week off ‘did wonders for.SchoolBoys Two, as we ripped

it up like Cube with a brand new payback, going 3-0 for our first

, perfect mark since the warmer climate of Week 3. We raised our

slate to 19-11 (63.3 percent) on the year. Week 12 features two
of the biggest games of the year, and we’re 9-3 in games
involving independents, so let’s get down to business.

N otre Dame (8-2) at (-3) Penn State (8- 2). Beaver Stadium,
ABC, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.

For awhile it looked like this game would have national
implications until the orange machine from’ Knoxville stunned
the leprechauns 35-34 last week. Apparently the N.D. defense
will get some more southern-fried cookin’ courtesy of the
speedy-Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl, while Penn State is
headed to the Fiesta, ‘where it’ll meet Tennessee.

Two signal-callers with solid stats this season, Rick Mirer of
ND and State’s Tony Sacca, lead potent attacks. Mirer had a
mediocre afternoon against the Vols and will have it even worse
against a vicious Lion D that will shut down Dame’s receivers
without much trouble,

Richie Anderson is legit at tailback for PSU and looking
stronger every week.’ Even though PSU has a weak offensive
line, it’ll move the ball effectively versus Dame cause the Irish
aren’t capable of applying any pressure. The Irish will chip
away with Jerome Bettis, Tony Brooks and Rod Culver to no
avail. This should be the largest crowd in Beaver Stadium
history, and they won’t be disappointed. Take Penn State -3.

Miami (8-0) at (-2 1/2) Florida State (10-0). Doak Campbell
Stadium, ABC, 12 p.m. C

Here it is, finally. No.1 meets No.2. What’s more, they’re in-
state rivals who already hate each other in the worst way. Both
squads come in a little stale but still unblemished. Both
defenses are dope, with the two best linebacking corps in the
nanon.

preseason tuneup

Chris McNeal scored 29 points and pulled down 11 rebounds in Pitt's second exhibition victory.

Pittfootbozll and bots/eetbczll teams
lay tloefom/zcioztionsfor their future

Last Saturday it was very brisk
at Pitt Stadium, but it was good
weather for college football

-nonetheless.

As the sun shined brightly
throughout-the first half of the
Pitt/Rutgers game, so did the
Panthers’ performance. However
it almost seemed that the sky
matched Pitt’s play throughout
the game.

In the third quarter and early
fourth quarter the sky started to
get really dismal, as did Pitt’s
performance.

The offense sputtered, and the
defense allowed Rutgers to get
within only three points. But late
in the fourth quarter the sun
broke through once again and

-cast’ an almost eerie light onto

the field.

The Panthers responded and
rose to the occasion. The offense
succeeded in killing most of the
time left in the game with a drive
down the length of the field.
Although they didn’t score, the
Pitt defense came on to seal the
victory by holding Rutgers’
offense and even scored a safety
in the meantime.

Comparing sports to the
weather draws one parallel:
unpredictability. At the beginning
of the year very few people had
any idea how good or bad the

Pitt football team would end up
being.

Many were pleasantly surprised
early and disappointed lately, but
some of the disappointment
disappeared with the 22-17 victory

.. over Rutgers last Saturday.

The fans and the media had no
idea what Pitt would do from
game to game, let alone the entire
season.

Not too much was expected of
Pitt’s football team before the
start of the year, so the players
just went out and played with no
pressure with regard to preseason

Stephen
Fﬁnn

Well, now that football season
is coming to a close and basketball
season is coming into bloom,
we’re faced with the same
dilemma. Listen to this
description, and judge whether
(no pun intended) this is Pitt’s
1991 football team or its 1991-
1992 basketball team.

0A young team with some solid,
upperclassmen leadership along
with a great deal of talented
younger players able to contribute
right away.

-A team from which preseason

evaluations expect little, but

which has enough talent and V -

potential to surprise a lot of
people.

-A team trying to bounce back
from past years of glory and
which is basically right on the
fence of being recognized asa
national contender once again.
This year is possibly a make—or-
break year for the potential
comeback.

If you guessed that this

description sounds like this year’s
Pitt footballteam and this year’s
Pitt basketball team, you’re right.
This goes to show you that both
programs are definitely in the
rebuilding stage with this year
possibly being the foundation for
the future of either program for
many years to come.

I think in comparing the two, .

that this year’s basketball team
will be similar to this year’s
football team. ‘
It'll win some games it is
supposed to lose, and lose some
games it is supposed to win.. If
Pitt’s basketball team just tries to
play its hardest every game, we
should be in for an exciting
basketball season. ‘
But be prepared! There will be
some celebrations as well as some
disappointments. Remember:
You can’t predict the weather.

The Pitt Swimming and Diving
team returns to action this
weekend with its first road meet,
a combined dual meet against
the University of Virginia.

The men will look to remain
unbeaten in dual-meet
competition, having compiled a
3-0 dual-meet record. For the
women’s team and head coach
David Belowich, this weekend
marks the first opportunity to
atone for a convincing loss at the
hands of Syracuse. Although
losing is never an acceptable
result, Belowich said he hopes
the loss may have a long—term,
positive effect on the squad.

“The loss against Syracuse was
taken well,” Belowich said. “We
discussed what happened [against

Syracuse] after the meet and the
next Monday, and that was it.
You can’t look back.”

Concerning any problems with
the team’s meet performance,
Belowich said the team wasn’t as
mentally prepared as he would
have liked. “One of my concerns
was the team’s lack of
competition,” Belowich said. “We
had very, very little competition
amongst the team [in preseason
training]. It turned out to be a
concern that was valid.”

Belowich said thateach season,
swimmers have to acclimate
themselves to the collegiate-
racing environment. “You have
to get used to racing,” Belowich
said. “Most of our swimmers
hadn’t raced since Easterns [in
the spring].

“There is a ‘putting it on the
line’ aspect [in competing] that

ORDER NOW: 624-PLAY

 

II-'- STUDENT I

GVERNMENT

involves all parts of the individual:
physical, mental, social,”
Belowich said. “As a Competitor,
that's a burden you have to learn
to accept.”

After a solid two weeks of
practice, Belowich said he
anticipates an improved attitude.
“I expect us to be better off and
not so tentative and afraid to race
this week, as we were two weeks
ago.”

For the men’s team and head
coach Chuck Knoles, this
weekend’s effort hopes to be
more of the same thing. The team
was “tired” after back-to—back
Friday and Saturday wins over St.
Bonaventure and Syracuse, but
the Panthers have had two weeks
to rest and are set to crank it up
in Charlottesville.

The men’s quick start can be
attributed to the emotional
intensity and depth of the team.
The Pitt divers have dominated
in all three dual meets. The trio of
Phil Cruz, Sean Braud and Mike
Naylor have placed in 14 of a

possible 18 top-three finishes
(including taking first in every
event). The swimmers have
received expected contributions
from their veterans (Fred
Constantini, Eric Mattson, Joe
Kozlina, David Bacharach, Matt
Porter and Don Boyd) as well as
their newcomers, most notably
Jonti Bacharach, Jeff Novotny and
Matt Brady.

_ While the women swimmers
hope to mirror the intensity of the
men’s team, the Panther divers
will look to continue dominating
both one- and three-meter events.

Junior Donna Flatch, fully.

recovered from off—season knee
surgery, leads a focused group of
divers who have provided Pitt
with a ton of team points. Against
Syracuse Flatch easily took first
place in both events, getting
strong support from teammates
Kara Sixbury and Anne Marie
Rose.

The Panthers will need another
big effort from their divers if they
expect to top a strong Virginia

Swimmers face Cavaliers in dual meet tlazs wee/eena’ ..

squad. Off to a 2-0 dual-meet
start that includes a pasting of
ACC rival Clemson, the Cavaliers
possess a deep, veteran roster
which includes 13 juniors and

seniors. In fact, UVa lost only one —

athlete to graduation: Melanie
Valerio, a four-time All-American
freestyler.

Despite losing such a talent,
Virginia has a swimmer with the
potential to be better than Valerio:
Karen Burgess. A junior who
specializes in the individual
medley, Burgess is the Cavaliers’
most important point contributor.
Belowich is impressed with the
consistent overall ability of the
Lynchburg, Va., native. »

“She is more versatile, perhaps,
than Valerio in that Valerio was a
freestyler, while Burgess is an

J1

IMer, which means that she can ‘

do everything,” Belowich said.

He indicated Burgess’ talent e

continues to ﬂourish. “She won a
2:05, 200-yard backstroke against
Clemson, and I didn’t know she
swam the event. That time is
about a second off our school
record.”

As for the Virginia team as a
whole, Belowich noted no
weaknesses. “They are strong at
every event and have depth,”
Belowich said. “That’s gonna pose
some problems for us.‘ By all
means, we’re underdogs.”
Belowich looks to combat the
Cavalier depth by avoiding being
swept in any single event. “Our
job is to try to split their people as
much as we can,” Belowich said.

A man whose job it is to prevent
such a tactic is Virginia assistant
coach Bob Clemmer. A 1979 Pitt
graduate who swam and coached
under Dick Bradshaw, Clemmer
anticipates a hungry opponent.
“Pitt is noted for their short— to
middle-distance swimmers,”
Clemmer said. “Whoever has the
better depth will win the meet.”

Last season the Virginia women
topped Pitt at Trees Pool, 181-
119. The Panthers hope to avenge
that loss in this dual-meet series,

which Belowich said is always I‘

intense.’ “Every year, regardless
of how it looks coming in, has
always been tremendously
competitive. I expect more of the
same on Saturday.”

The ﬂarnboyant Busta Rhymes of Leaders of the New School.

Annual CMJl\/lusic Marathon more than just ‘free stuff’

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

“To the Vista,” I emphatically
urged Sihad the cab driver, to
which he quickly snapped back,
“This is the third time I’m going to
that hotel this morning. What's
going on?” , _

What Sihad wanted to find out

about was the annual Mecca for_

collegiate—music types to big, bad
Knew Yawk. Yep, a fatt number
10 times ('81 was the first year)
for the College Media Journal, or
CM], seminar/concert/ festival-
type 0’ thang, which took place
over the Halloween weekend. (If
you wanna schmooze, this is for
youze.)

As if Sihad’s third-morning run
to the Vista weren’t proof enough,
let us quickly come to grips and
realize that college radio isn’t
something that is always run in
the basements of student unions
in the dark. In fact, some of
college radio is run in big, bright
buildings in large metropolitan
areas by blue—blazered men and
women. No doubt, and they were
throwing this bash.

Money—making, monster—major
labels rounded themselves like
cattle for the call of Nuevo York’s
shrieks, setting up camp all over
the lobbies, ballrooms and
conference spaces in an effort to
plug their bands’ greatness.

As I awaited my delegate, the

_ 

honorable Heidi Glenn, to arrive,
I was bombarded in the cozy,
tree-filled lobby of the Vista with
videos from a Warner Brothers
band, Fates Warning, as well as
the new Nirvana video. All were
projected from 16 telly screens.
The idea behind the whole
conference was apparent from
the outset: Our band is better
than yours, and we can spend
more money to prove it.

After spotting Heidi, we opted
for our bag of goodies, which
was givin’ to all of the 5,000+
registrants. The bag included a
listingof all the club events as
well as the panels that would
take place over the four-day
period of plugging.

The highlights of the bag
included a Fantagraphics Comix
catalogue, new—music rags like
Alternative Press, Minnesota’s

"Cake, B~.S'z'de and the Knitting

Factory Knotes catalogue, which
highlighted the avant acts comin’
to the happening, near—jazz club.
Also of importance because they
were free was a sampler from Big
Cat records, which features new
cuts from recentsignee Cop Shoot
Cop, a new sampling of the
upcoming Voivod record and
fresh copies of The Source and
Street Sounds, a hype Canadian
mag.

Consciously attempting to avoid
the propaganda around us yet
eager to accept free music and

mags, we headed to the Indie
Conclave panel on the third floor
of the Vista. Late and shuttled to
the back, I began to load my Pitt
News camera with film. It quickly
became apparent that I had no
idea what I was doing, so I played
it of f as best as possible by looking
around and pretending to

mumble at Heidi. The camera‘

was quickly dubbed “broke and
useless.”

The panels are occasionally
interesting, depending on what
topic is being discussed. Being a
b—boy, I opted for nearly all the
rap panels, but of the others I
attended, the Pop Culture and
Influence panel was the best.
Featuring Dave Marsh of Rolling
Stone, Lady Miss Kier, Vernon
Reid and others, the panelists
discussed the shallowness of mass
media, pop icons (where it was
determined that Madonna is the
only true musical icon of the last
decade, while others like Donald
Trump are now considered), the
need for positive trends (like the
peace-symbol example) and the
urgency of the panelists for us, as
receptors, to question what we
accept.

Other panels of noteworthiness
were the silly seminar on the
state of college radio today, a Q
and A session that became
ridiculous as the college-music
directors on the panel never really
addressed the issues at hand in a

serious manner and the
independent-label panel, which
included Kramer ofShimmy Disc
and Dave Rosencrans of Sub Pop.
Also, Chuck D. was a keynote
speaker in a jam—packed metal
panel, and Queen Latifah gave a
keynote address. A lot of mugs
were in the house throughout the
whole weekend: Ice-T, Marley
Marl and Sonny Sharrock all spoke
on panels.

Neil Young was inducted into
the dubious CM} Hall of Fame,
while Jane’s Addiction received
Group of the Year. Queensryche
took loud rock LP of the year,
while Wynton Marsalis won in
the jazz realm.

Ziggy Marley scooped the New
World album. R.E.M. took two
awards: “Losing My Religion” was
voted Song of the Year, and Out
Of Time received Album of the
Year.

So you think major labels had
anything to do with these
outcomes? Well, let’s see. Every
winner is on a major label and
receives significant airplay on
commercial radio, which is
probably the criteria for receiving
awards as stupid as these. “If you
can cross over and make us
money, you’ll win" should be the
title of these awards. .

The real reason for going to the
CM] is to see the bands live. Over
200 bands were in town at over
25 clubs to show off their stuff. A

Photos by Boice Allen

Beastie Boys/ Cypress Hill show
at the hot Building was a sellout,
as was the Buzzcocks at the
Marquee.

The overrated Urban Dance
Squad show received a lot of
hype, as did a Superchunk show
at the Marquee. Primus was
shipped off to New joisey for a
Maxwell’s show that almost
everyone went to except 1.
Knowing that Primus is terrible, I
wentto the Beowulf for a boomin’
Monster Magnet Halloween show
then hopped to CBGB’s for Cop
Shoot Cop.

A massive rap show took place
at the NYU Loeb Center with
Cypress Hill, Tim Dog, Naughty
By Nature, Leaders Of The New
School and others playin’ to a
packed house — the highlight of
the weekend, no doubt.

One of the great things about
CM] is that it’s got sum’em for
everyone. If you’re lookin’ to kiss
a little butt in hopes of an industry
job, you came to the right place.
If you wanna see a vast amount
of shows, ranging from the
Unsane to Insane Jane, you in
there.

You wanna hear what your
favorite stars have got to say?This
is it. If you can except the
infiltration of the majors and their
propaganda machines, which I
am still not comfortable with,
everything is cool. Plus, you get
a lot of free stuff.

Back in effect and comin’
correct with some New York noise
fresh from the rebound from the
College Mediajournal conference
that featured a massive hip-hop
show as well as some large
panelists discussing the state of
rap music today.

Knowledge was shared at the

panel with moderator Paul

Elektra Records discussed the
relationship between college
radio, rap and the labels’ inﬂuence
on both. A theme during the
three days of panels was college
radio's unending influence on
rap music. Everyone from Heavy
D. to Marley Marl to MC Lyte gave
college Djs props as the only real
source for hip-hop music.
Other panels included the Rap
Conclave Panel hosted byjeffrey
Sledge ofjive Records. This panel
was dominated by Hank Shocklee

audience’s questions, mainly

leading a beat-box flavor as
Monie, Lyte, Tim Dog and others
stalled.

The highlight o’ tha weekend
was definitely at the bumpin'
NYU Loeb Center, where a packed
house was treated to over 10 acts.
Brooklyn’s Fu-Shnickens, whose
debutsingle, “Ring Tha Alarm,” is
spiraling up the charts, kicked
some major ragamuffin ﬂavor.

much ﬂavor. Their debut LP" Fruits
Uv Nature is solid.

O.K., Organized Konfusion,
were all that, as is its debut, self-
entitled LP. Yo, these macks is for
real, droppin’ serious lyrics. Prince
Poe—I—flow and Pharoahe Monch
are legit. The beatsare way hype,
and the record is on Hollywood
Basix. Don’t sleep.

Black Sheep were next, and
Dres and Mista Lawnge showed
their live show is just as nasty as
their maiden release, A Wolfln
Sbeep’s Clothing. “Flavor Of The
Month” ripped the house up, as
did “OPP,” as‘Naughty By Nature
kicked it live. Their Tommy Boy
release is growin’ on me. Check
“Guard Your Grill.” C’mon when
Cypress starts to kick it. The Hill
tribe came out sportin’ hoodz an
that but proved they ain’t no
weak, West Coast punks. They
dropped a heavy live show on
the mixed crowd. “How I Could
Just Kill A Man” was the crowd
favorite.

Legendary bassist Carter keeps bumpin’

By Rob. Pugliese
Stajf Writer

lion Carter is a figure who has
already dented the jazz world
with some of the finest acoustic
bass the world has ever seen.
Listening to his views on jazz
bass and music in general gives
the impression that he'll continue
to make waves both as a
performer and, more dramatically,
as an educator. Carter is
probably the most recorded
bassist in the history of jazz with
over 1,000 albums. He is an
innovator with his use of the
“piccolo bass.” In addition, Carter

is a composer, arranger and
currently a professor of music at
the City College of New York.
The legendary jazz bassist came
to Pittsburgh two weeks ago and
presented a seminar titled
“Whose Time Is It?" in the
Ballroom of the William Pitt Union
as part of Pitt’s 21st Annual Jazz
Seminar and Concert series.
Carter demonstrated bass
techniques, specifically finding
the beat, with some help from
drummer Alan Dawson. Carter
broke down the keeping of time
to its simplest form, playing
straight with the beat, and pointed
out the importance of keeping a

steady rhythm.

“The idea of playing a rhythm
is to enhance how the chord
sounds rather than to disguise
the chord," Carter told the
audience. He discussed bass
playing for different situations:

behind a horn player, a_

saxophonist and also vocalists.
“My time—keeping is in my ear,"
Carter said. “I hear the meter in
my head.” I

Carter said the downfall of many
bassists is that they don’t
understand how their equipment
works and never take the time to
learn. I

CONTRACEPTIVE NEWS  FOR WOMEN ONLY!

Q: My girlfriend and I have been using
Q condoms for a while now. Is there any
birth control we can use that doesn’t effect

é sensitivity like condoms?

A; Yes, there is a relatively new product you
should try called VCF” Contraceptive Film, a
birth control method for women that you can
buy without a prescription. One of the great
aspects of VCF is‘ that in most cases neither
partner can feel VCF after it has been inserted.

Thousands of gynecologists across America have been recommending
VCF Contraceptive Film to their patients. VCF Film comes in the form
of a 2” semitransparent square that is extremely soft, most women say
they can't even feel VCF after it’s inserted. VCF is one of the easiest
forms of birth control that you can buy today. All you have to do is
simply fold VCF over and insert like a tampon: VCF begins to dissolve

A in a matter of seconds. No need to worry about removing VCF,

because there is nothing to remove. VCF simply washes away
naturally. Each square of VCF contains an effective amount of non-
oxynol 9, the leading spermicide recommended by doctors. SOUNDS
LIKE A WINNER!

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, November 14, 1991

 

By Larry Chough
Stajf Writer

As I enter Joseph C. Phillips’
suite in the Vista Hotel in
Pittsburgh, he offers fruit from a
gift basket with an insistent
“please,” as I politely refuse. It
would seem that this actor is
somewhat unaccustomed to the
benefits of being a celebrity on
the rise.

Phillips, best known for his
role as naval Lt. Martin Kendall
on TV’s “The Cosby Show,” was
in town last Wednesday to
promote his first feature film,
Strictly Business, which opens
nationwide on Nov. 8.

One of Phillips’ striking
characteristic is his genuine
honesty when he talks of life as
an actor. When _asked typical
questions such as what about this
picture appealed to him and what
future projects he has in the works,
he tells it like it is—not how it is
assumed to be.

“I’m not at a point where I can
afford to turn stuff down. There
aren't many roles that I could
turn down, unless I wouldn’t be
able to face my family or friends
as aresult of it,” he says.

Phillips does, however, feel a
close tie to the character he
portrays in Strictly Business,
Waymon T insdale III. Tinsdale is
a bright business executive
headed, toward success and a
partnership whose life is turned
upside down by the sight of a
beautiful girl, whom he becomes

obsessed with.

Although the movie is a light-
hearted comedy, Phillips stresses
an underlying theme pertinent to
his own life.

“At the core of it the movie's
not too deep, but if you want to
take it to the level of the middle-
class black, you can see a feeling
of being torn between two
worlds,” Phillips says.

“I know Waymon,” he says. “I
know what it’s like to be a black_
who is criticized for conforming
to ‘white’ society and betraying
his fellow ‘brothers.”’

Phillips elaborates on this point
by telling a story about when he
was in college at California’s
University of the Pacific, where
he basically hung out with friends
in his dormitory. Most of the
residents in Phillips’ dorm were
white, and when he and his
friends would go to lunch, Phillips
would sense resentment and see
glaring faces on other blacks,
who tended to sit together.

“I was one out of three blacks
in a dorm, and sometimes I would
feel a yearning to eat lunch with
the other blacks on the other side
of the room,” he says.

“I saw the same situation

happen to another guy, and they
ripped into him the same way
Bobby (a character from Strictly
Business, played by Tommy
Davidson) rips into Waymon.”

Phillips remembers feeling torn
between two lifestyles and feels
that “both sides have to come
halfway.”

This feeling lies in Waymon as
well. He feels torn between his
responsibilities to his firm and
the responsibility to help other
blacks, such as Bobby, up the
corporate ladder.

Phillips, a native of Denver,
Colo., initially was interested in
becoming a lawyerupon entering
college. After two years he
realized his passion was acting
not law, so he transferred to New
York University and -graduated
with a fine—arts degree in acting.

His big break came in “The
Cosby Show,” and he is currently
in his third season with the show.
“I approached [Cosby] and told
him that I wanted to do this
movie, but it would run into the

last three shows of the season.
He encouraged me to do it, not
worry about it, and he said he
would see me next season.”

About Cosby, Phillips says,
“You think Bo knows. Bill knows
more.”

Phillips remains excited about
the release of his first feature film,
which co—stars_ Halle Berry as
Natalie, the girl of Waymon’s
dreams.

When discussing the future, he
says, “The reality is it’s a hard
-business for everyone. It's always
about the next gig — to keep on
working.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 14, 1991

 

Another Manny dandy: Leaving Trains and Fish and Roses.

V By Mike Shanley

Stajf Writer

This Friday the Upstage Lounge will
play host to a mother of a show that runs
the gamut of what’s still good about that
ambiguous beast known as Indie music.

Punk rock mightbe dead, but that hasn't
stopped the Leaving Trains from kicking
around its corpse and getting some good
mileage out of it. On albums such as Kill
Tunes and the controversial Fucle the band
was loud, fast and rocking, with singer
Falling James (the only member still with
the band after 10 years) testifying themes
of alienation that any angst-ridden,
misunderstood and therefore drunk-to-

.“ "~

..’

forget—about-it young man (or woman, for
that matter) could relate to. If there was
justice in this world, the Trains would be
recognized as true spokespeople of a
detached, pissed-off generation. Shoot,
James was the Richard Hell of the ’80s!
The Trains probably couldn't care less.
They aren't actually out there to make it
big, just to make noise, which they’re still
doing. So even though their latest album,
Sleeping Underwater Survivors, doesn’t
quite hold up to their past ﬂights of
brilliance, their set on Friday still ought to
leave the Upstage in a beautiful shambles.
Also on the bill Friday night, at the other
end of the musical spectrum, is New
York’s Fish and Roses. Instrumentally

composed of drums, bass and organ, the
band plays quirky, repetitive riffs in weird-
time signatures that sometimes
approximate jazz and sometimes art-rock
doodlings. In the end, though, they’re
something else completely. On top of that
is bassist Sue Garner’s voice, which sounds
like a country singer who stumbled into
the wrong gig.

Fish and Roses released an EP on their
own Lost label in 1987, which was followed
by We Are Here to Serve You on
Homestead Records two years later. Both
included guest appearances by performers
known in the “Downtown New York”
music scene, like guitarist Chris Cochrane
and Yo La Tengo’s Ira Kaplan. In a previous

GYRO

Pittsburgh appearance the band left this
writer ﬂoored, showing amazing skill and
precision as well as a bent sense of humor.
Onesong consisted of a medley of the old
“Young Man’s Blues” merged with their
own lopsided “HaveA Nice Day and Fried
Rice.” Does it sound kind of whacked?
Well, you better believe it is. And if you
have any sense of adventure, you’ll be
there, right up front, soaking up the whole
thing. ‘

Los Angeles’ The Leaving Trains, New
York’s Fish and Roses, Boston's Common
Ailments Of Maturity and Pittsburgh ’s
Watershed do the large metropolitan-city
thang with an over—2], 9.-30p.m. leichoff at

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Thursday, November 14, 1991

Continued from page S-4

“With the advent of amps, bass
players just plugged in and turned
on without understanding what
they were plugging in and what
they were turning on," he said.
Carter encouraged players to learn
more about the bass and how it
works.

He responded to a wide range
of questions from his audience.
One of the topics he touched
upon was the difference between
a classical bass player and a jazz
player. “Generally a classical
player is not curious about the
instrument,” he said. “Generally
classical players are not aware of
the ranges and the things they
can do. They’re not aware of bass
development.

“Jazz bass players have such
terrible environments. There’s no
dressing room. You can’t warm
up. Up until 10 years ago there
was no specific school for the
bass player to learn the bass,”
Carter said.

Carter was born on May 4,

., 1937, in Ferndale, Michigan, about

a block away from Detroit. He
was one of eight children in the
family, with one brother and six
sisters growing up in the tough
times of the great depression.
“My inspiration was my father,”
he said.

His musical life began at the
age of 1 1, when he started playing
the cello. At age 18, during his
senior year of high school, Carter
decided to pick up the bass. He
earned a B.A. at the Eastman
School of Music in New York and
an M.A. in double bass at the

,Manhattan School of Music in

1961. Carter made a name for
himself as a jazz player and session
musician, playing with such greats
as Eric Dolphy, Cannonball

Adderly and Wes Montgomery.

At age 26 he became the first
player to join the classic Miles
Davis Quintet that formed in late
1963. This powerful group
included Davis, tenor saxman
Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock
on piano and drummer Tony
Williams. The quintet recorded
the brilliant Miles Smiles and the
Coolein’ at The Plugged Nickel
sessions live from Chicago.
Shorter was 30, Hancock, 23, and
Williams, 17. With their youth
they brought a fresh exuberance
and life back into Miles’ music at
a crucial time. Miles was struggling
with critics after coming out
against the avant—garde
movement and needed to find a
fresh forum for his music. This
quintet eventually equalled the
powerful quintet of Davis,. Philly

Joe Jones, Red Garland, Paul
Chambers and the colossal John
Coltrane in popularity and
innovation.

The liner notes from Coolain ’At
The Plugged Nicleel said about
Carter, “Spectacular technique
and unfailing rhythmic sense
locked him into step with Williams
like two pistons in a well-oiled
engine.”

Carter expressed a strong
preference toward the acoustic
double bass in comparison to an
electric bass guitar. He said that
within the realm of jazz, the
standup bass captures a better
sound than the electric. Carter
said he feels deeply distressed
that teachers are not concerned
about helping young players find
their best sound. According to
Carter, the fact that young bassists
gain no experience with the
acoustic will only hurt their sound
and technique.

“For me, the electric bass
doesn’t really capture the sound
of the ballad — the feeling of the
ballad,” he said. “One of the
things that disturbs me in the

public-school jazz scene is that
the bass players in the bands all
play electric, and because of this
those stage bands never get off
the ground musically because
the rhythm section is not truckin’
at the right zone — never in the
right sound zone.”

Carter said that today’s jazz
scene is changing (and not
necessarily for the better) because
the music is in the hands of the
wrong people. The people who
genuinely care about jazz have
no control and are few in number
compared to the others that rule
this genre.

“It’s not that it’s not good now,
but at that time the people who
were responsible for the music
earned that right to be responsible.
People who are now responsible
haven’t earned the right to be
responsible.”

The “piccolo bass” is a half-
sized bass that Carter only uses
with his own quartet. The bass
itself was originally a smaller
instrument, but after the bass
itself became bigger in size, Carter
was the first player to make the
“piccolo bass” part of the
leadership in a band.

He had an interesting view of
Wynton Marsalis, who many jazz
critics and fans elevate to the top
of the ladder as tmmpet players
of the modern era go. Carter
played with Wynton in the early
’80s. I

“Maybe he’ll be a great 10 years
from now, but right now he’s just

an average player to me,” Carter
said. 

Carter recently dropped the
bass tracks for New York rappers
A Tribe Called Quest's latest effort,

The Low End Theory. The Tribe
wanted to use an acoustic bass,
and Carter’s style flowed perfectly
with that of lyrical geniuses Q-
Tip and Phife of the Tribe.

“I had fun doing that,” Carter

said. “They’re nice, young people
who have a view of music that
seems to be important. Find out
what’s going on with it.”

Carter’s plans for the present _

include a trio project with pianist
McCoy Tyner.
