 “Beyond Caring’

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

 gDr. Stanley Shostak of the Bio-
? logy Department explained what

it means to be “beyond caring"

 Tuesday at noon in 120 CF. “This

is where I’m at.” he told the near-

. ly 200 students present, as his
 multimedia presentation began. ‘

Speaking softly, slowly and

, clearly, the popular professor de-
cribed his changing attitudes to-
ward education since he first be-

i came a teacher. Four movies, in-

cluding The Absent-Minded Pro-
fessor and films on prison life,
the University, and mass media,
bombarded the audience visually
as Shostak spoke.

“What's the University for?"

_ Shostak asked, as the session
started. According to students, he
declared, "its a place to get away
from." Other answers to the ques-

tion, he felt, were even worse.‘

"Maybe the students are/the only
sane ones going." he suggested.

The young professor admitted,
however, that he had his own ideas
on “what it’s for.” In order to
make them meaningful, he took
audience on a journey——an intel-
lectual odyssey—which began
when Shostak first walked into a
Pitt classroom.

At that time, he confided. his
approach to education was quite
traditional. "1 had something to
say and students had to listen.“
That was his attitude then.

Before long, though. Shostak

A group of about 80 students.
faculty and staff members from

= - the University will travel to Vir-

ginia Beach, Va.. on Saturday.
March 7, to view the clipse of the

 ' sun. The group will be led by‘Rob-

.ert M. Nelson, Daniel Fellow in

 Astronomy at Pitt.

‘Virginia Beach is the nearest lo-

cation to Pittsburgh where the

eclipse of the sun will be total (it
will be only about 80 per cent
eclipsed in Pittsburgh). The group
will set up three or four telescopes
and perform a variety of experi-
ments. They also will make a film

»using various filters and plates

that will isolate segments of the
spectrum. Mr. Nelson plans to use
the film for instructional purposes
in future astronomy classes.

About 60 per cent of" the group
bound for Virginia Beach are stu-
dents from Mr. Nelson's introduc-
tory class in astronomy.

The group will leave from the
Cathedral of Learning at 11:30-
p.m. Friday and return to Pitts-

’ burgh Saturday night.

concluded that he could not go on
this way. "I was alienated. I hated
more than I loved. Lots of beady
eyes staring at me increased my
alienation. It grew to the point?
where I hated my students and
they hated me. I didn't want to live
that way. I didn't want to be a

monster. I didn't want to hate."

But Shostak had no ready solu-
tion for his problem. "I knew what
I didn't want." he recalled. “but I

didn't know what I wanted.“

The turning point came when he
heard a lecture on the importance
of caring. It was then that he
learned that “the ideal teacher is

a man who's a symbol of caring.“

Most gratifying to Shostak was
his view of the "wages of caring."
"When you care about students."
he argued. “they know it and they
turn to you with their porblems.

. with their questions. with their un-
certainties; ‘they turn to you for

help.“

/ But a new problem appeared.
"I liked that idea.“ Shostak recol-
lected. "but I din‘t know how to

care."

His wife helped him see the sol-
ution by agreeing to audit his Life
Science course for a term. "Just
having her there was the most
important thing." Shostak explain-
ed. "I wasn't talking to the beady
eyes anymore. I was talking to my

wife—a person. an individual."

As a result. Shostak could no
longer speak as he had before. 
cared about my wife more than I

«Partial Eclipse In
  9 Pittsburgh Saturday

A solar eclipse is one of the
many exciting ‘(phenomena of na-
ture. but it is also an extremely
dangerous event to observe. As
the sun is blotted out in greater
degrees. the pupils of an observ-
ers eyes become dilated.-This per-
mits more infra-red radiation to
focus upon the retinas.

Although he may feel no pain,
he may easily receive terrible
burns to the retinas. This damage
is irreparable. Medical authorities
suggest that observers look away
from the eclipse, or use two com-
pletely developed negatives that
have been developed to their
greatest density.

Sunglasses DO NOT provide
adequate protection; infra-red
rays penetrate the glasses. To be
completely safe. the observer
should have his back to the sun
and hold up a card containing a
pinhole. The rays of the sun will
be focused by the hole and a sharp
image will be projected on a white
surface a short distance away.

cared about the subject matter.
more than I cared about how I
said something. What was impor-

, tant was that she understood it. It

went beyond hearing and listening.
It was communication." .

Shostak learned “that what I
wanted to do was to communi-
cate.” Put differently, he “pro-
gressed from caring to doing.”

Still another crisis emerged.

however. Did biology have a place

in this scheme of things? Was bio-
logy a body of knowledge which
had an identity? Did Shostak have
an obligation to his subject,mat-
ter? Might this not clash with an
obligation to his student or him-
self?

Shostak concluded that he could
express‘himself while at the same
time being relevant and being a
responsible biologist.

“So much of my identity is tied
up in biology,” he explained, “that
many of the things I think are im-

'portant are important in terms of

their biology.”

The engaging professor cited
several examples of his beliefs. as
a person who is a biologist:

"Agression is natural.

“There is an animal morality in
man which is good. Let’s bring

that out by being tremendous ani-
mals that we are instead of cover-
ing it up with false humanity.

"Sex is natural.
achieve happiness through sex.

“Man must live in harmony
with nature.» ‘

“Man.has a duty to-use his tech- ’

nology for the good of all‘-living
things. '

and we can’

Shostak Relives "Intellectual Odyssey’

"The sacredness of life can be
seen in animals and plants.

"By sensing this. man can per-
haps appreciate the sacredness of
human life."

By making such statements in

the classroom. Shostak felt he was’

finally being "responsive" to stu-
dents. "These are the important
things." he maintained. he went
on. "they are not only the things

I want to say. but also the things ‘

students want to hear."

One problem remained. How
could these ideas be communi-

cated? How could Shostak get his

message across?

“Through multimedia,” he an- -

swered, “you can turn students

on. You can get them out of their i

shells, get them involved, get
them,to talk to you.”

"Multimedia did one more
thing." he added. "It allowed me
to express things about myself
that I couldn't express any other
way." .

"There's a little bit more inte-
grity in multimedia than in lectur-
ing." Shostak concluded, “because
you can express all sorts of things
about yourself without lying, with-

out being ashamed."

The trip over. Shostak told his
entranced listeners what he had
learned from the eperience.
"Teaching is an art form.“ he de-
clared. And the University? "It

can be an arena for self-expres-

Sl0Il.

“That’s where I’m at,” he said,
ending the lesson. “Creativity is
beyond caring. Now my lectures
are an expression of myself.”

Students can be creative too,
Shostak noted, unable to resist
making one last point. “Think
about it," he urged. And. after a
pause. “What do you think?"

(' hand over this office to Don Marbury, I would like to talk about the faculty
Tahd adrhinistratioin.) “ _ l

 I A "Since my work and interests here have led me to more meetings.

: administration first. ' A

 
  
  
 
   
  
    
  
   
  
 
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
   
    
  
   
  
  
    
   
 
  
 
  
  
   
 
  

.. 5» iWithout a- doubt. the most interesting aspect of the administration
‘during my three years here has been the change in personnel. .,

When I entered the University. Chancellor Posvar was stﬂl a rel-
Iative newcomer. In the ensuing years. such positions as Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Dean of the College 0f‘Arts and Sciences,

j'Di're'ctor of Housing, Director of Student Aid- Director of Admissions
. and many assistants to these positions saw a change in personnel.

Inlthe majority of thesechanges. older men and women were re-
placed by younger_ones. In my opinion. most of the new administrators
seemed generally more receptive to student needs than did their pre-
fdecéssors.,. ‘ A I

__ it MANYNEW administrative positions were initiated to facilitate
;.1‘the University's Black Studies program. These new positions were vi-
;-.tal. and the personnel have consistantly proven their understanding and
‘ability since assuming the SC positions. l ,
-But. there are still many problems in the administrative framework.
 The most glaring sore is in the Dean of Students office. ' V
, The Dean of Students— and his assistants are directly responsible
 '-to the Vice Chancellor of Student Al'fairs. This position.which Mr. Bern-
lard Kobosky assumed last year when Dr. Jack Critchf'ield lef't for a bet-
 terijob at a southern University. is the most thankless job of all admin-
"‘ iistrative positions. Mr. Kobosky and his staff of Dan McFadden and
A, Gary Houston’ have spent long hours trying to solve such student prob-
"."jl‘ems as the financing of student publications. student government
 elections, campus security. and many others. Considering the tremen-
}}"dous amount of unfinished. and often unstarted. business that “Smilinf'
"_Jack Critcfield left behind. these men are doing a great job.

A. And it is here. in the area of student problems. that the Dean of
Students could and should assume more responsibility. Whetherit is
fear or incompetence that prompts the Dean of Students office to con-
s_i_stantly act in a vague manner. Idon‘t know for sure; but their record
is nearly perfect. ' ” I

The recent Student ' I government elections could have been straight-
. ‘ened out by the Dean of Students office; the Winter Weekendhassle
could have been straightened out by the Dean of Strdents office: many
{other student problems of the past few? years should have been
l_ian'dl‘ed by the Dean of Students office. But few they weren't and_the
~'bai‘der_i rests on the shoulders of Mr. Kobosky and his staff.

I WOULD suggest that for the number of ‘assistants ‘(and secret-

‘could be solved. thus allowing Mr. Kobosky and hisstaff time to handle
V-problems much more important than the attack of the Strdent Union's-

yities Calendar. j
.1‘ f.~There is a fine precedent for the "cleaning out" of administrators
="wl_io fail to do the job thay are being paid to do. I am sure that the
; ‘Chancellor realized the p_roblems that existed in the other areas where
personnel changes took place. and should look closelyAat this area be-
 fore he stops his administrative house ‘cleaning. ’ A ‘A‘ .
 One last administrative problem is a small and very personal one.
but one which affects many students. I believe that the Director of
‘Student Publications has grown disgusted with the attitudes of both
*students and fellow administrators. and the replacement of Mrs. Esther A
A7 .Kitzes with a younger person who is more familiar with financialaspect

semantics. The SGEC cannot dis-s

qualify an elected official, only a
candidate. The use of the term
“disqualify” when the term "un-

tain students to question the com-
mittees authority.

The irony of the whole mess is
underlined by the fact that the

charge of a $40 overexpenditurer

to unseat the president-elect un-

Reconsider,
Allan Senio!

Editor. The Pitt News: -

I should like to let my heart
run wild over Allan Senio's let-
ter to The Pitt News. February
23.1970. They manage to tie up
our situation here in a pretty
tight package "college punks
. . . draft dodging commie queers

. . . .pinko Profs. . . hippies."

I am tired. and life is hard.
and I hate that in me that sits
around thinking of creative ways
to tear down and give up.

Somehow. I get tense when I

label people and tie up their
hearts. grabbing each ventricle

with a tight fist. telling them-

what they are.» denying becoming.
I loathe me static and unchanging
—like a closed door. I make my-
self an idol and tell others "You
have all missed the point . . 
"Everybody these days "
"Remember all those .. 

I regret when I act and talk as
if other people are a communist
plot. when I reduce them to their
lowest common denominator.
as if to label some. to throw
away some. to kill some. or to

control 'sor_ne—when —— reduce

themas if this makes if safer for
me. I condemn and condemn. I
am suspicious. I avoid. I am nar-

Trees Hall.

Cur Victims

Editor. The Pitt News:

I have just'recently become
another victim — a victim of the
"Hill". I drove up to our spacious
and very modern Trees Hall to
use some of its facilities. Of
course there was no place to
park. so-I was forced to drive
around for fifteen minutes
until I finally found a place in back
of Trees Hall.

When I was through inside and
went out to my car. I found it had
been vandalized. There was a
hole in my windshield. Now‘I
ask. why the Hell have a facility
like Trees Hall. and afford both
the people who work there and
the people who have activities

there no safe place to park their
cars? _

Its almost“ common knowledge

that anyone that parks in the i

Trees Hall-Field House ‘vicinity
has a 50-50 chance of having
their the victimof some sort of
vandalism. Casimir Myslinski
and the Athletic department ask
why more people do n0t*come to

athletic events‘? Need" they ask‘? -
_My car was vandalized during

the day. With this in mind I can

, imagine the havoc that goes on

at ‘night. It boils down to this.
if the Universityis going to pro-
vide a facility for its students it
should also provide some form
of protedtion of the students pos-
sessions. Not some policeman in
the entrance of Trees Hall check-
ing ID's. but some real security
its a crime to have "a facility
like Trees Hall and because -of
thisvandalism let it go to «ruin. "

I know nothing will come‘ of
this letter. People just won't—do
anything till some misfortune’
befalls them as it did ime. But

‘ something must -be I done. this

vandalism must be stopped.-and ’
it is‘up to our University-to do it!

General Curriculum of the Col-
lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences
at the University of Illinois (nick-
named "32-10" for its college and
curriculum coder serves as a col-
lege and an advising center for the
undecided student.

"We are quite pleased with our
curriculum's progress from its in-
ception (Fall '68» to the present.”
reports Assistant Dean Patrick
L. Miller. “Our advisors and their

students have a remarkable rap- .

port (in part due to the youth of
our advisors: which is no small
element in our success.

"F or the undecided freshman.
somewhat confused and apprehen-
sive about the reputed imperson-
ality of a large campus. the Gen-
eral Curriculum provides advi-
sors and staff who consistently
and uniformly are informed. in-
formal and -interested in individ-
uals.

“While some of our students
have no clearly defined.interests
or goals, others are possessed of
protean goals and astonishingly
varied interests. Neither is easy
to advise but, by and large, we
succeed in helping. And that’s our
goal.”

The General Curriculum was in-
_augurated to serve - those fresh-
man and sophomore students who
had not yet decided upon a major
field of study. Before this. the un-
decided student was compelled to
choose a tentativemajor or elect
to enroll in the Division of Gener-
al Studies.

' Beginning with an enrollment of
1,100 students (11 per cent of all
Liberal Arts undergraduates) and
six half-time advisors, the Curri-
culum has grown to 1,600 students
(15 per cent of all Liberal Arts un-
dergraduates) and 10 half-time

‘advisors, plus two assistant deans.-

‘If you take a look at your Pitt-

the second week of March is
scheduled as Engineers‘ Week.
a First. I would like to tell you what
it is all about. In 1903. a group of
engineering students at the ‘Uni-

. versity of Missouri felt that they

needed a vacation from a long

winter of classes. books. and ,
studies. They claimed that they

received a "revelation" that St.

Patrick was an engineer.

In celebration of this fact. they
cat all classes on St. Patrick's
Day and engaged in various forms
of fun and merriment. (They were
expelled from school for two years
for thier efforts.» In 1909. Iowa
State and the University of Arkan-
sas-followed Missouri's lead and
eventually most schools west of
the Mississippi had celebrated

came a highly celebrated Engi-

east of the Mississippi began car-
rying on the tradition of Engi-
neers' Week. At Pitt. Engineers’

Week was first observed in 1954_

due mainly to the encouragement
and efforts of Dr. G. R. Fitterer.
The celebration has become so
extensive in scope that it is now

one of the major events on the

Pitt campus.

signs models. creates new ideas
and tries to find the best solutions.
These problems can be of any
kind: biomedical. pollution. trans-
portation. safety. geophysical.
housing and many others. Since
engineers deal mostly with social
problems. this year we chose "En-
gineers Improve Our Environ-
ment" as our theme. Also since
the Engineering School is a part of
this community. we decided to
make Engineers" Week evident
throughout the "city. We especially
want you CAS students to come
and join us. This isa perfect op-
portunity to meet each other an to
close the so called "gap" between
us.

The week is touched off by a_ pa-
rade to honor the annual arrival

of St. Patrick to the campus. St. a

Patrick is always a little late in
arriving for his own parade, and
so the parade always begins with-
out him. Then, by some very un-
usual mode of transportation St.
Pat does arrive in his green robe
and long white heard. In the past,
he has arrived by helicopter, in an
authentic Sheik’s car complete
with harem, in a dragster, in a

Nike missile, on horseback, in

deep sea diving gear, and from a
manhole in the middle of the
street.

The arrival of St. Patrick sig-
nals the long-awaited‘ start of a
series of competitive campus
events. On occasion this has taken
the form of a Reno gambling ca-
sino. a mammouth monopoly
game featuring Oakland proper-
ties. displays built by students of
each department. a search for hid-
den shamrocks. a five legged race.
a tire rolling contest. a tug-of:
war. a charity service project. a
debate. a brick throwing contest.
a dramatization of TV commer-
cials. and a catch-a-live—pig con-
test. ’

The climax of Engineers‘ Week
is the Shamrock Ball which fea-
tures the crowning of St. Patri-
cia. a concert. and the presenta-
tion of the Shamrock Award to the
winning department. After pre-
senting the award. St. Pat myster-
iously and quietly disappears from
the campu_s and is not seen again
until next years arrival parade.

A complete schedule "of the
events will be in the Pitt News.

convenient for all, the lab demon-

Clinic building. These displays will
pertain to the theme, “Engineers
Improve Our Environment.” We
also invited some of the area high
schools and our parents to see our
displays. Each department will
have its own display and explain
it. The service project is the most
important event of the week and
we need everybody’s help. Each
department devises its own mon-- .
ey-making scheme and the pron:-'
ceeds are donated to the Western
Pennsylvania School for the Blind.

Come and join the fun. It is not
just for the engineers. We hope
you will all participate.

‘Stealing From

Open Rooms

Since September, 93 thefts
have occurred in University
dormitories. Of these, 80 per
cent took place in rooms lef_t,‘__
unlocked by students.

"~71-‘('-

According to Bernard Ko-

_ bosky, vice chancellor of stu-

dent affairs, and John Vrana,
director of University Hous-
ing, all information indicates
that the "thefts are done pri-
marily by a sneak thief.‘ It is
highly possible. that students

- are robbing fellow students.

Both Kobosky and Vrana
stressed the necessity for stu-
dents to assume responsibilityag,-9
in securingtheir personal pro-“A”

there will be no sympathy

‘shown to any person caught

Besides his offensive play, he
has been described as a defensive
“monster.”

In his junior year at Canon-Mc-
Millan Ostrowski was switched
from end to. halfback on offense.
During the 1969 season he came up
with the big plays at C-M, with his
explosive running ability breaking
him loose on counter and trap
plays.

He is also touted as a leading
receiver and a "devastating"
blocker.

The Hendersonville, Pa., star
decided upon Pitt because, “Carl

the idea of bringing Pitt back.”

Ostrowski plans on studying ei-

Ridl. Putting It .Together

The Panther basketball team
posted a 12-12 record during
the 1969-70 season and Coach
Buzz Ridl admits that it could pos-
sibly represent the greatest-
achievement of his 15 year career.
Last year the cagers were 4-20.

"I wasn't sure that we would
reach ‘ .500." Ridl
“I‘m really pleased. I figured
that wed pull some surprise up-
sets because I knew that the club
would be improving. Yet, I was un-
sure that we would be a consistent
winner; we became consistent
winners when we began playing at
home, though."

In addition to the players‘ in-
creased concentration and aggres-
siveness, Ridl indicated that the

robust student support contributed »

to- this season's basketball for-
tunes.

“Next year I’ll be looking for-
ward to the students filling up the
stands,” Ridl said.

One of the performers who
should help draw Panther fans to
the Field House is Kent Scott. His
16.9 scoring average is the best
output for a sophomore cager
since Don Hennon bloomed into a
varsity star in 1957'.

His 32 tallies against West Vir-
ginia in Tuesday’s finale reviewed
memories of Don Hennon, Pitt's
last All-American. Not since Hen-
non canned 27 points ir‘ra contest
11 years ago has a Panther topped

remarked. ‘

BUZZ RIDI.
Greatest Achievement?

Also, it has been six years since

-anyone has" bettered the 405 points

(in one season) which the blond-
haired sharpshooter from Kansas
City has amassed. Moreover, it is
doubtful that any college player in

Western Pennsylvania has equal- _

ed or surpassed Scott’s .517 field
goal percentage this season.

He set the scoring pace in 11

» «=-- consecutive games and in 16 over-

all during the year. Yet, two of the
contests within his 11 game streak
are the type a player attempts to
block out of his mind, resounding
losses to Georgia Tech ‘and Tem-
ple.

In retrospect, Ridl mentioned,
“Both teams had good nights;
we’d do much better if we met
again. We would just have to exe-
cute better. We had a nasty time
against the press then."

After a miserable beginning (1-
6), the Panthers leaped beyond
even the most loyal fans’ hopes
and finished the season by cap-
turing ll of the final 17 decisions.

Ridl. however, isn't permitting
his most recent success to over-
shadow reality. He stated that in
order to compete. against teams
like Davidson, North Carolina St.,
Army and Cornell next year, he’
will have to patch several weak-
nesses within the squad.

"We need stronger jumping
power and, tough inside rebound-
ers. We’ll have to improve our de-
fensive quickness and overall‘
speed," he said.

The freshmen Cubs are impor-

tant to Ridl’s rebuilding plans. He , I

believes that several of them may
break into the squad’s top eight or
ten spots.

For 1970-71, Ridl will be groom-
ing a stronger squad for a tough-
er schedule. For now, he’s con-
cerned with grabbing the best

 high school talent available.

In Rebuilding Year

Gymiiasts In Easterns

The gymnastics team is
competing in the Eastern In-
ttercollegiate Gymnastic
League Tournament through to-
morrow at Syracuse. N. Y.. and
Warren Neiger sees hope for the
future of Pitt gymnastics.

The coach expects many fresh-
man to return to help out next sea-
son. and he is currently involved
in a somewhat inproved recruit-
ing program.

There are still many problems
when Neiger attempts to lure the
potential gymnastics stars to-
wards Pitt. though.

“The scholarship money I have
available right now is tight,” he
said. “You have to offer the per-
son you are recruiting something
worthwhile to come to Pitt. Right
now our porgram here may not
look good to a kid and I don’t
blame him because we don’t have
as good a record as other colleges.

her greed cit

"Many out of our outstanding
athletes are leaving the area to go
to colleges outside of Pennsyl-
vania because of this fact. But. as
our program picks up. as it is do-
ing now. and our record keeps im-
proving. we will see many of these
kids staying in the area and com-
ing to Pitt once again.

Currently. the gymnasts are
only ahead of Syracuse among the
major eastern gymnastic teams
in the East. Syracuse. is the only
Eastern rival that the gymnasts
have been able to defeat this sea-
son.

The gymnasts final record this
year was 3-7, a 300 per cent im-
provement over last year’s 1-9
mark. And because of few losses
through graduation, Neiger ex-
pects more improvement next
year.

"This has been a rebuilding
year for us and next year we are
hoping to win four or five match-
es. he said.

. The gymnasts are concentrat-
ing on the Eastern tourney at the
moment. They aren't expecting
tremendous successes. but not
completely because of lack of tal-
ent.

Most of the Eastern opposition
has scored very highly this year.
That’s also one of the big reasons
for the gymnasts sub-par record.

During lasts winter‘s struggling
efforts. the gymnasts seldom to-
taled more than 100 points in a
match. This season they have nev-
er gone below 100. but the Eastern
pzyvers have scored well over the
