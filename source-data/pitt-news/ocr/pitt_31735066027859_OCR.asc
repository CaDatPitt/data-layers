Jazz ensemble
s_peaks of harmony

By Cesca Antonelli
For the Pitt News

The room is.quiet until one
person starts, and then they
all get going.'The rhythm
section plays off each others’
cues, the Saxophones start
getting into it and before you
know it, the whole band is
on. This jazz ensemble is not
about seminars or trips to
Jamaica ——" it’s about music.

“It’s a chemistry. It’s a lan-
guage,” said Derrick Finch, a
senior music performance
major, with a grin.

He’s not the only one who
can’t stop smiling.

“I haven"t“-heard better
auditions in the 25 years that
I’ve been here,” said Nathan
Davis, the ensemble’s direc-
tor. “It was one of the
biggest, best turnouts.”

The program benefits from
its number of returning

members to help build expe-
rience for the newer ones.
Though most of the band’s
members are not music
majors, the program offers a
learning experience that
even graduate students can
enjoy. . '

“I want to get a whole lot

better. I’m probably going to
have to work my butt of ,”
said Jeremy Suggs, a fresh-
man engineering student.
Though he’s been playing
for a number of years, this is
Suggs’ first experience with
jazz. - v

This diverse gathering of
people, backgrounds and
experience levels actually

to express. They all agree
that’s what it’s about.

Musical edge cuts
through concert series

By Kirin Kalia
For The Pitt News

Without the colorful lights,
blaring publicity and cheer-
ing crowds of popular music,
there are composers and
musicians who are creating a
new kind of music.

Cities like New York,
Boston and San Francisco
have been the major forums
for these artists, but Pitt’s
music department-sponsored
Music on the Edge series has
brought this avant-garde
sound to Pittsburgh for the
last six years.

Thefirst concert of the
season is this Saturday, Sept.
16, at 8 p.m. at the Frick
Fine Arts‘Auditorium.

Three artists from New
York, including two Juilliard
graduates, will perform early
and more recent works by
American composer Donald

Martino, winner of every
major musical award and the
Pulitzer Prize.

“These guys are amongst
the finest of new music in
New York. Just watching
them play, they’re incredi-
ble,” said Matthew
Rosenblum, the series’ co-

director and associate music '

professor.

The cost is $5 for students
and seniors, and $8 for the
general public. Tickets can
be purchased at the door or
at the music department.

Now in its_ seventh year,
the concert series has attract-
ed mixed audiences of locals
and Pitt students.
Coordinators have hopes of
attracting more Pitt under-
graduates this year. Three
more concerts will follow
this semester (see page 3 for
concert dates), with major

Myths shroud
sexual assualt

By Mary Koch Ruiz

The following is a month-
ly column dealing with
myths of sexual assualt.

Myth: Myths regarding
men. women and relation-
ships do not exist.

Reality: When presenting
programs on the contribu-
tory and preventive
aspects of sexual assault
to students, incoming
as well as returning, it
is sometimes very
frightening to hear the
number of myths which
are invariably reiterated
in every program. Many
of the myths that individ-
uals subscribe to are root-
ed in beliefs about tradi-
tional sex-role stereo-
types.

Following are several of
those myths which sur-
face in every presenta-
tion:

-Women never mean
“no” when they say “no.”

°Sex and masculinity

are one and the same.
°Men must always initi—
ate sexuality.

-Women like to play
hard to get.

°Popularity among male
peers will increase as the
numbers of sexual
exploits increase.

°And. believe it or not,
the women on this cam-
pus are not having sex
and then crying rape to
their friends in order to
protect their reputations
(actually stated by a male
student at Pitt and went
unchallenged by his male
peers).

I believe that some peo-
ple choose to believe
in myths for several rea-
sons. First of all, myths
can be used as a way to
rationalize one’s own
behaviors.

For example, claiming
that a victim of sexual

Myths

°Frompage2

assault was “asking for it”
because she/he had been
wearing tight clothing
(one of the many “asking
for it” myths) is only anoth-
er way of excusing the act of
forcing sexual contact
against the will of another
person.

As a society, we seem
to have a need to blame
others for our own
actions. Unfortunately, the
only purpose that myths
regarding sexual assault
serve is to perpetuate a
“blame the victim” attitude
and make it much more
difficult for rape victims
to come forward, seek help

 and ultimately, recover from
 . the assault.

Secondly, many individu-
als, men and women, do not

 want to believe they could

ever be assaulted by a
“friend,” date or acquain-
tance.

 happen to me.” Therefore,
‘ when informed of the rape

of a friend, they rely on

 myths as a way to find fault

with their friend’s behavior

 before or at the time of the
 rape. The belief is that “I
 will never be raped because
I I would never engage in that
ff‘7_.j-_"7~ same behavior.”

The tragedy is that not

 only was someone raped,
7 but the victim of the rape is

not getting “expected” emo-

I tional support from friends.

This lack of support from

. friends, and possibly family

members, can substantially

impede the recovery process

from the rape trauma.
Finally, I think myths are

used by society as a whole
to shield the truth about
date/acquaintance rapes.

It is interesting that
victims of stranger rapes
are almost always believed.
However, because the per-
petrator of a date or an
acquaintance rape could
be “the boy next door” or
a state representative or
a CEO, “she must be lying.”

  

The myth is that good-
looking, financially well-off,
and seemingly community-
minded people never rape. A
woman who served as a
member of the jury in the
William Kennedy Smith trial
commented after the trial,
“He is so good—looking, he
doesn’t have to rape in order
to get women.”

Myths are convenient for
aeople. They are repeated
when the truth is too threat-

_ . zning or when people do not

music." said Finch. “Say you’re a
great piano player; you sound good
by yourself. You’re a closet player.
Here. you play in a group. If some-
one next to you sounds good, it’s
positive criticism. If not, its positive
criticism.”

Eager to share their enthusiasm
with others, the members of the Jazz
Ensemble have a rigorous schedule
planned this year. This November
will be the 25th anniversary of the

Jazz Seminar at Pitt. In addition to
the quartets that will play at brown
bag lunches every Wednesday in
October preparing for the Seminar,
some students and guest artists will
participate in the Outreach Program
and perform in centers and places
close by.

In addition to yearly on-campus
projects like the Jazz Seminar
and the Spring Concert, the Jazz
Ensemble will be traveling to a
number of area high schools,

about one per month, starting in
October.

“It gives everyone a chance to put
themselves out there, gives you a
chance to learn what fits in,” Finch
said.

The band is also looking forward
to playing a lot of original music
this year. Mary Ann Morocco, a
graduate student working on her
Ph.D. in ethnomusicology, has writ-
ten several pieces for the ensemble
before and has been tasked with

churning out one chart a month. lr
addition to Morocco’s work, the
band will be playing some of Davis‘
originals, as well as some charts that
were donated to the program b_\
alumni.

“It’s exciting to me,” Davis said

“We have a good group. We car
write —— we’re not limited to things
that are store-bought. We’ll do some
funk, some big band, just abou'
everything. We’re looking forward tc
this year.”

Concerts

°From page 1
events in the spring as well.

The audience for this kind of music
grows exponentially every year,
according to Eric Moe, assistant
music professor and co—clirector.
“They show up once, and they dis-
cover [the music] doesn’t bite.”

“It’s not music in the mainstream,”
Rosenblum said. “It’s more adven-
turous. more challenging.”

While some of the music is more
experimental, there are also elements
of contemporary classical music and
popular music. The instruments
involved provide a clue as to the
kind of new music that will be per-
formed.

“There’s a wide range of music 
it’s a big ‘edge’,” Rosenblum said.
Moe founded the series because
only one other group in Pittsburgh.
the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble,
was presenting new music artists in
addition to its own performances.

“The idea was there that little new
music was in town,” Moe said.

“We solely bring in groups from
around the country,” Rosenblum
said. “We’re different in that way,
and we focus on chamber music,
meaning smaller ensembles.”

In the past, Music on the Edge
has collaborated with Carnegie
Mellon and the Three Rivers
Arts Festival to put on “gala” con-

certs that have a broader appeal.
“When we do [these concerts], we
bring in a bigger audience,”
Rosenblum said.

Music on the Edge receives half its
funding from the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences and the music department,
and the other half from foundation
grants.‘

Moe said grant money from
the Pennsylvania Council of the
Arts may “cease to exist” if
Congress succeeds in eliminating
the National Endowment for the
Arts. In that case, “we may have to
cut down on the number of con-
certs,” he said.

Both Rosenblum and Moe are com-

posers themselves, and know “the
people who play our music,” MOE
said.

Moe, who teaches electrocoustir
composition, will be performing hi:
computer music for October’s con
cert.

As the reputation of the serie
grows, Moe and Rosenblum receiv-
requests to perform from more high
ly-skilled new music artists.

The musicians playing this week
end are the most recent example c
this. Even though the series ha
already lined up the year’s concert:
Rosenblum said they managed to f
them in. “We just couldn’t turn thei
down,” he said.

ket."

After searching other student
placement pages from other
universities, Callahan came up
with four prototype pages that
were tested by 100 students.
She said the current page was
the choice of the testing stu-
dents. I

For students writing
résumés, there are several sam-
ples and tips on how to make
your resume more effective.
You can even print out these
sample copies for later use.

Though most schools charge
employers a fee to view avail-
able student résumés, Callahan
said, Pitt does this service for
free. Callahan said this service,
along with the Placement
Service’s successful statistics,
tempts employers tolook at
Pitt students before anyone
else.

“This page is an invitation to
employers to come check us
out,” she said.

Callahan said that the page is

not an alternative to coming in
to talk to a counselor. It cannot
serve as a replacement for
mock interviews, for instance.

One method that is featured
on the Internet page and is also
practiced by the Placement
Service’s counselors is the
STAR technique that teaches
subjects of interviews to
answer questions in the most
efficient manner possible.

“The STAR system allows
you to give responses that do
not require a second question,”
Callahan said. “This is what
interviewers want, and I
thought it was important to put
it on the web page.”

One of Cal1ahan’s priorities
in researching and creating the
page was ease of use, even
with students who have never
used the Internet.

Sophomore Kristi Julian and
junior Tamara Vottero had
never used Netscape or the
World Wide Web before, but

“This is very simple to use,
especially since it is on-line,”
Julian said. “I’ve.never used
this program before, but it’s
easy to find what you are look-

In an effort to improve the
page, Callahan and Bob
Perkoski, director of the
Placement Service, are looking
for.two experienced web pro-
grammers to improve the con-
tent and structure of the page
this fall.

Perkoski and Callahan both
said they will do what it takes
to get students registered and
using the resources of the
Placement Service and the ser-
vice’s home page.

“We want people to know
there is hope,” Callahan said.
“Life after college is not a
dead-end proposition, and if
we can get more students
actively involved in the job
search preparation process, we
can improve their lives dra-
matically.”

Pathfinder for 2 1-2 years,
said that the organization
also participates in other
activities such as telemar-
keting high school visits
and special on-campus pro-
grams.

There is a special program
called “Sorting It Out”
which brings high school
juniors to the Pitt campus.

“The students get a tour

Pathﬁnders

Pathfinders call students
who have written to the
university to answer ques-
tions on a more one-on—one
basis.

Emily Allen, another Pitt
Pathfinder, said she is
always honest when answer-
ing the questions that con-
cern parents and students.

“When they ask about the
safety of the campus, I
don’t lie to them. I tell them
that you always have to

ll A THEATRE HEAR You

tell me that

they like to see that I have

so much enthusiasm in my
school,” Allen said.

She said that her attitude

makes a good impression on

the visiting students and '

parents.

Allen said that
Pathfinders have helped
enrollment at Pitt. She
said they have gotten
positive feedback from
students saying that
Pathfinders were a major

.help to them when deciding

on Pitt as a school.

Yant said that through
Pathfinders she has met
many people within Pitt’s
administration. Ex-chancel-
lor J. Dennis O’Connor
once dropped in on her
while giving a tour.

“It is a great way to meet

all kinds of people,” she
said.
Both Yant and Allen

agree that one of the hard-
est aspects of being ' a
Pathfinder is when they give

a tour and no one in the

group talks. But Allen said
it only has happened to her
once.

Yant said one of the most
memorable things that
happened to her as a
Pathfinder dealt with a
group of Japanese students
who were unfamiliar with
the dormitory lifestyle of
American universities.

“I led the group up into
Tower A to show them a
mock dorm room, and as we
were going up to it, the stu-

dents saw a chalk outline in 

front of the doorway with
ketchup splattered around,"
Yant said. “I had to take 20
minutes to calm them
down.”

Pathfinders are hired at

the beginning of each term. .

All undergraduate students
with a minimum QPA of
2.5 are eligible.
Applications are available
in the Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid in Bruce
Hall.

Opinions
Mumia for Martyr

Innocent until proven guilty. That’s the way the saying goes,
right? But what about after someone has been proven guilty?
-The American justice system was constructed in order to pre-
vent the innocent from being wrongly convicted. But there is
certainly no guarantee that the guilty will pay for their crimes.

Thirteen years ago, Mumia Abu—Jarnal was accused of killing
a police officer. A jury of 12 of his peers found him guilty of the
crime and sentenced him to death. Now, all these years later,
Abu-Jamal is still in prison doing everything he can to save his
own life.

The 1983 trial which resulted in Abu-Jamal’s death sentence
centered around the testimony of five eyewitnesses (one of
whom was Abu-Jamal’s brother) who each testified to seeing
Abu-Jamal kill the officer. Abu-Jamal himself confessed the
crime to people in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. (He
had also been shot in the commission of the crime.)

The fact is, the jury in Abu-Jamal’s trial found this informa-
tion to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty.
(But now, when the possible appeals are running out, Abu-Jamal
has managed to garner huge support for his cause. Members of
every walk of life, including many members of the nationwide

university community, have jumped on the Mumia bandwagon.

Even Hollywood celebrities such as Ed Asner and Susan
Sarandon have taken up the cause to “Free Mumia.”

You might ask, how can a convicted murderer (who brutally
killed a police officer) find such wide-spread support? The
answer, as it is to so many problems, is to use the Internet. Abu-
Jamal was fortunate enough to be literate when he went to
prison. His ability to communicate gave him a voice to the out-
side world.

There are men and women in prison today whose convictions
are highly questionable, but even they could not manufacture
the public support Abu-Jamal has managed to win. The only dif-
ference between Abu-Jamal and any other prisoner is that many
other prisoners are not educated enough to know how to access
the outside world.

It is interesting to see the hordes of people who ﬂock to the‘
candlelight vigils, protest rallies, meetings and other events held
to protest Abu-Jamal’s sentence. How many of these people
know the actual facts behind the case instead of the propaganda
fed out by Abu-Jamal himself? How many believe that Abu-
Jamal would confess and not retract that confession until seven
years after he was convicted, when he needed another reason to
appeal his sentence?

Many groups have made Abu-Jamal out to be some sort of
martyr, but for what cause? In the Middle Ages, literacy was
one of the few things which could successfully save a capital
offender from execution. Obviously, this is no longer the Middle
Ages. Abu-Jamal has received his justice and been found guilty
by a court of law. Now he should be forced to face the penalty
he was given.

The Turner Elementary ripoff

s i g n

Rick Aim the
Nowlin lobby
of Turner

Elementary School in the
Pittsburgh suburb of

Wilkinsburg says, “Turner
School — It’s All Good!”

It should be amended to
read, “It’s All Politics.”

By now, you have probably
heard about the so-called
“Tumer Initiative,” an attempt
at educational reform by turn-
ing over the administration of
that school to Alternative
Public Schools, a Nashville-
based private company. But
sadly, the real purpose of the
privatization has absolutely
nothing to do with education.

I should know, I’m from
Wilkinsburg. Indeed, I grew up
just four blocks from Turner
and have kept abreast of the
situation for the past year.

So why did it start? Because,
I’ve been told, of an ongoing
conﬂict between a parent of a
Turner student and a teacher.
Only this parent just happened
to be on the school board and
decided that this teacher
should be disposed of.

It’s no secret that
Wilkinsburg students have ter-
rible grades and score poorly
on standardized tests; a recent
editorial in The Wall Street
Journal noted that only one
student did better than average
on the SAT last year.
Compound those with higher
school taxes for teachers, and
the solution seems obvious ——
since the teachers we have
aren’t doing the job, let’s find
some cheaper ones who will,
getting rid of the “troublemak-
er” in the process. Problem
solved. (Twenty-four teachers
have been laid off.)

But not so fast. For openers,
according to the common-
wealth’s Public School Code,
such “subcontracting” is ﬂatly
illegal. That’s why the
Education
Association, the teachers’ bar-
gaining unit, _has so far beaten
APS in court. On Sept. 18, the

issue goes before the state
Supreme Court.

Furthermore, the three-year-
old APS, one of five outside
bidders for the Turner contract,
has absolutely no experience in
school administration. A cou-
ple of years ago it hired a pub-
lic relations firm to try to get
into the Nashville schools but
ended up being tossed out on
its ear. APS is now offering
higher test scores plus break-
fast and after—school programs
for supposedly the same
amount that the district would
spend with regular union
teachers. Sounds too good to
be true.

That’s because part of the
school district’s problems are
out of its control. In 1988, the
Pittsburgh police began a
major drug sweep in
Homewood-Brushton, just
across the borough line. But
the dope dealers simply moved
to a portion of Wilkinsburg a
few blocks away, and since the
Wilkinsburg cops were out-
manned, they operated more
easily. By 1989 street gangs
showed up, and drive-by
shootings rapidly became a
staple on the evening news.

Although the dramatic rise in
crime was limited to a small
area, the entire borough’s
image suffered. Frightened
people, especially those with
school-aged children, fled.
Property values plunged, forc-
ing the borough and school
district to raise taxes dramati-
cally to meet the budget.

Wilkinsburg has its share of
absentee landlords, who often
neglect their property and care
only about collecting rent, and
their tenants are often what
some call “the permanent
underclass.” Most district stu-
dents come from here, and
many are transients (try learn-
ing when you don’t know if
you’ll be here next week) and
truants. Most of the middle-
class parents who still live in
Wilkinsburg send their chil-
dren elsewhere. The schools
are so bad because the teachers

have little to work with.

Surprisingly, more district
residents oppose the privatiza-
tion than support it. One group,
Wilkinsburg Residents Against
Profiteering, ran a slate of six
candidates for school board in
the May primary. Five won;
four will challenge the so-
called “Turner Seven,” those
approving APS, in the general
election in November. (The
one who is no longer running
has moved out of the district.)

Despite its public statements,
the board is pulling all kinds of
stunts. It has eliminated the
entire college prep curriculum
at Wilkinsburg High School,
which means you can’t take
algebra, biology or a foreign
language there anymore. Also,
one teacher there, a conserva-
tive Christian not normally
pro-union, said flat-out that
one of the current board mem-
bers “[is] only concerned about
getting his taxes lowered —— he
sends his kids to private
schools.”

Conservative ideology also
plays a role. That should sur-
prise no one, considering its
contempt for both government
and unions. The Kansas City-
based Landmark Legal
Foundation, a conservative
Christian group, is donating its
services to the school board,
and the board also recently
hired Calvin Clinton, a local
blowhard who masquerades as
an activist, to do PR for the
district — and that money
came from right-wing
financier Richard Mellon
Scaife, the publisher of the
ultra-conservative Tribune-
Review.

So what do these have to do
with education? Nothing -
and that’s my point. Once
again, the children are being
caught in the middle of adults
fighting among themselves.
and no one benefits in the
process.

Phillips is
just a
misun-

- mouse?

ColumnistThat

Sean unfortu-

Duncan nate lost

A soul. He tried
so hard for people to like
him, he really did. All he
needed was a little love,.a
pat on the back and a dash
of good luck.

But no, that was too much
toiask for, and now poor 01’
Lawrence Phillips must suf-
fer the consequences. He
didn’t mean any harm —
kind of like Lenny from “Of
Mice and Men.” You know,
the guy who loved those
cute little mice so much that
he snapped their dainty
necks.

George isn’t very happy
with Phillips, and he might
have to blow the back of his
head off with a shotgun. But
that's besides the point.

Phillips will go down in
the books as a misunder-
stood, leading Heisman
Trophy candidate for the
Nebraska Cornhuskers. N 0
one appreciated him. He was
only the most revered run-
ning back in ‘Husker history
since Mike Rozier, and his
popularity was growing like
a corn stalk on steroids.

In Phillips’ first two
games this season, he rushed
for 359 yards and seven
touchdowns. He could have
achieved all the rabbit farms

« ever imagined, but no. His

emotions clouded his senses

V and now he’s arrested.

Phillips, a junior, was
arrested Sunday for alleged-
ly assaulting his ex-girl-
friend and consequently,
coach Tom “George”
Osborne threw him off the
team.

I told you George wasn’t

a happy-

The incident took place
early Sunday morning at the
woman’s Lincoln apartment.
Reports said he allegedly hit
the woman several times.

she was not seriously
injured. Phillips turned him-
self in and was released 45
minutes later on $100 bond.
Man, can you imagine the
problems Phillips must
have? The ‘94 national
champion ‘Huskers won
their first two games and
outscored their opponent by
a totalof 114-31. He was a
lock for the Heisman

New coaches bring different levels of experience
to Panther track, volleyball and gymnastics programs

By CaroleLynn Gerlock
For The Pitt News

The Pitt sports department
is turning over a new leaf
this fall with the hiring of
three varsity assistant coach-
es.

Pitt has hired David Sobal
as the assistant coach for
men’s and women’s track
and field, Steve Craig has
been named assistant coach
for women’s gymnastics and
Jeff Belmonte has been
named the assistant coach
for volleyball.

Sobal comes to Pitt with a
great deal of talent. He grad-
uated from Earlham College
in 1969 and received his
M.A. in education from
William and Mary College
in 1989.

He coached at Christopher
Newport University from
1994-1995, where he was
the men’s and women’s
cross country head coach
and the associate head coach
of track.

Sobal has received a num-
ber of awards for coaching.
In 1994 he received the
NCAA-South-Southeast
Region Men’s Cross Country
Coach of the Year.

In 1993 and 1994, he was

both Dixie Conference’s
Men’s and Women’s Cross
Country Coach of the -Year.

Head coach Steve Lewis
feels Sobal can help improve
some areas.

“He brings a level of expe-
rience and confidence in the
middle—distance to distance
events, as well as cross
country, areas we plan to
continue to upgrade within

our program at Pitt,” Lewis -

said.

Craig. the new assistant
coach for the women’s gym-
nastics team, is relatively
new to the sport, said head
coach Debbie Yohman.

Despite being new to the

sport, though, Yohman said
she feels the training he has
had makes him qualified for
the position.

A 1995 graduate from Ball
State University, Craig
received a degree in pre-
medical preparation. He has
been involved in the sport of
gymnastics for about three
years, working as a volun-
teer coach for two years and
program coaching women’s
gymnastics for two years.

Because Ball State has a
good gymnastics program
and an excellent coaching
staff, along with his knowl-

For The Pitt News

Pitt soccer player Bret
Stezoski’s career has traveled
a long way since his days at
Plum High School. It has
taken him from a former
player to a redshirt college
walk-on to a standout on the
Panther team.

Stezoski was a two-time
all-section selection in high
school, captain of the team in
his junior and senior seasons,
and played in the Coaches’
All—Star Classic.

He also played on the
Penns Forest team, a team
made up of some of the
finest soccer players in
Western Pennsylvania.

“The Penns Forest team did
a lot of traveling to play in
tournaments,” Stezoski said.
“We went to Cincinnati, Erie,
all over Pennsylvania and
Maryland.”

He has been playing soccer
most of his life, and he was
certain that he wanted to
continue on the collegiate
level.

“I started playing when I
was young, probably six or
seven years old. My brothers
all played, so I got started at

really young age,” Stezoski
said. V

After his all-star status,
Stezoski was recruited by
some of the smaller schools
in the area. such as
California (Pa.) University
and Washington & Jefferson
College. So how exactly did
he end up at Pitt?

“I chose Pitt because of the
academics. Pitt has a lot to
offer in the way of acade-
mics,” Stezoski said. "I
wasn’t sure what I wanted to
study. and so Pitt was a good
choice because of the wide
range of majors.

“Also, I knew that I wanted
to play soccer, and so that
factored into my decision. I
was also accepted at
Duquesne, but they don’t
have a team and I knew that I
wanted to play,” he added.

Stezoski’s career started
off slowly at Pitt. In fact he
didn’t even try out for the
team his freshman year. In
his sophomore year he decid-
ed to walk-on and made the
team. But he also was red-
shirted and could not play in
any games.

“Being redshirted was very
difficult for me,” Stezoski

Cindy Alvear. “She’s better
now than ever, individually.”

Building on her 1994 sea-
son will be a difficult task to
maintain. Driscoll was named
to the All-Big East (first
team). For the year, Driscoll
led the team with a .280 hit-
ting percentage and 23 solo

In the 1994 Big East title
game, Driscoll led all players
with a .611 hitting percentage
and added 12 kills, 10 digs
and seven blocks. During the
NCAA tournament, Driscoll
recorded 36 kills, 12 blocks
and a .400'hitting percentage.

“I was just hoping to get

Driscoll said. “I had minimal
goals for the season except to
be healthy.”

Driscoll had been plagued
by consistent right shoulder
problems since her high
school days, but had success-
ful surgery in 1992.

“She got healthy,” Alvear
said. “The level of improve-
ment in her game went up
with the level of improvement
in her health.”

After the end of last season,
Driscoll ranked second on

IRONICALLY, THE TIME To START
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.

C an't afford to save for retirement? The truth is, you
can't afford not to. Not when you realize that your
retirement can last 20 to 50 years or more. You'll want to
live at least as comfortably then as you do now. And that
takes planning.

By starting to save now, you can take advantage of tax
deferral and give your money time to compound and grow.
Consider this: Set aside just $100 each month beginning at
age 50 and you can accumulate over $172,109“ by the time
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and you'll have to
budget $219 each month to reach the same goal.

campaign, all Phillips needed to do was
rush for 3,404 yards the next two years
to break Tony Dorsett’s all-time NCAA
rushing record. That’s approximately
1,700 yards a year.

That poor kid.

And who better to express his frustra-
tions than on a rough-neck woman who
undoubtedly got every bit that she
deserved? Surely the 6—foot, 222-pound
patsy wouldn’t want to get into a bar
fight with a chew-swallowing, sister-
loving hick and maybe risk getting his
face kicked through his head.

Nope, that wasn’t challenging enough
for Phillips. He wanted something
extra—special to smack around — some-
one who would put up a real fight.

Reports also said Phillips allegedly

dragged her around the apartment.
Damn, he must have been really pissed.
I wonder what she did to provoke him?

Apparently, there is more than one
misunderstood youth on Nebraska’s
football team. In an unrelated incident,
Phillips’ backup, Damon Benning, was
arrested Saturday night for a similar
charge of mischanneling his emotions.

Lincoln police said that a 19-year-old
woman went to Benning’s place to pick
up some belongings. Benning first
greeted her with verbal venom and one
thing led to another and he “grabbed
her around the neck.”

Put more eloquently, he choked her,
and then pushed her around. I guess
those belongings meant a lot to
Benning.

There has been no comment on

Benning’s status.

You can bet that George is reloading
his gun.

Can you imagine what Phillips and
Benning would have done if Nebraska
lost or they had to pay for an educa-
tion? Or if they didn’t get spoon-fed by
the university? Or in Phillips’ case, if
an opponent held him under 100 yards
rushing? Or if he didn’t get his 1995
Mustang convertible?

Just the mere thought must send
bruises through the University of
Nebraska’s female population.

But for now, Phillips has to be say-
ing, “George, tell me ‘bout them rab-
bits.”

Not only does Driscoll lead
by example, she leads with
her mouth.

“She’s always been a
leader. That’s one of the rea-
sons why I recruited her.”
Alvear said. “She always has
an opinion, an idea — and she
certainly doesn’t mind shar-
ing it with the coaches or the

Growing up approximately
20 minutes from Chicago,
Driscoll chose Pitt for numer-
ous reasons.

“I wanted to get out of
Chicago. I wanted to go far
away,” Driscoll said. “I really
liked the coaching staff. They
are a real quality group of
people. I didn’t wanted to be
treated like a commodity and
I could tell that I wouldn’t
here.”

Before attending Pitt,
Driscoll went to St. Francis
High School where she
excelled at volleyball and

basketball. She was named,

the 10th Chicago Tribune
Athlete of the Year. She
earned first—team All-State
honors in helping her team to
the Class A State Volleyball
championship. She also was
named AAU All-American.
In basketball, Driscoll was

named first team All-State as
a senior. She averaged 16
points per game while collect-
ing an astounding l5
rebounds per game. Her 1,484
rebounds ranked her, at the
time, fourth in state history.

Driscoll will turn 21 this
Sunday and has big plans.
Those plans include going to

Belmonte graduated in
1991 from Aquinas College
in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
where he received a B.S.
degree in business adminis-
tration.

At Aquinas College, he
played men’s volleyball and
was an assistant coach for
the women‘s volleyball team
for the last five years.

In 1994 Belmonte started
his own youth team called
the Mizuno Juniors. The

fourth place at the AAU
Championship this past sum-
mer.

“It is a great time to be
here, with the volleyball
team turning over a new

things,” Belmonte said.

He said he looks forward
to exploring the city once
the busy season and recruit-
ment settle down.

done, the Pitt sports depart-
ment is looking forward to
successful and winning sea-

said. “After not playing for a
year and then coming back
and being redshirted, it really
hurt me. It was hard after not
playing in a game situation
for so long."

Stezoski’s junior season
was a different story alto-
gether. He definitely got the
game-type situations he had
been missing.

In fact, Stezoski not only
played in every game, he
started every game and never
came out. So. after not play-
ing in a game in two ye-rs,
he played in every second of
the season.

In that season he registered
15 shots, knocking in one of
them. He also had an assist,
but his proudest moment
came from a defensive stand-

point.
“My own personal high
point came against

Connecticut. They came in
with one of the top scorers in
the nation, and I shut him

down.” Stezoski said.

Stezoski has already had
one highlight this season for
the Panthers. It came in the
second game of the year
against St. Francis in the
consolation game of the Pitt
Soccer Classic.

With about five minutes
left in the game, the score
was tied at one when
Stezoski put the game-winner
in the net. It was an impor-
tant win for the team. send-
ing them to their first win
and third place in the tourna-
meat.

Stezoski is a student of the
game and plays out every
game in his mind before it
starts. This visualization
helps him concentrate on the
task at hand.

“I usually get here [the
locker room] early with a
Walkman on,” he said. “Then
Ijust visualize the game in
my head and get focused.”

After such a long career in
soccer, one might think it

 
   

  
    
      

would be difficult for
Stezoski to walk away from
it after his eligibility runs
out. In order to stay involved
in the sport, he has thought
about coaching.

“I’ve been helping Plum
area soccer the last few
years. I would. like to do
more, but I don’t have the
time. There is definitely an
interest there for the future.
though,” he said.

Away from the soccer field.
Stezoski has other goals to

fulfill. He is, as he put it, “a
political science major, right
now.”

His real dream, though, is
to go on to law school. '

“I want to go to law school.
If that happens, I don’t know.
But it's what I would like to
happen,” he said.

In his spare time Stezoski
likes to play basketball. He
also enjoys playing video
games.

His favorite game? FIFA
‘95 Soccer, of course.
