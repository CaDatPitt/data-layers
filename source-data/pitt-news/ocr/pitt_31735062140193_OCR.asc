UNIVERSITY GAINS ADVANTAGES . I

RELAY CARNIVAL ANNOUNCED
BY UNIVERSITY or PENNSYLVANIA

University Appears in Class with
Neighboring‘Colleges—-Meet to
Be Held April 29, at Phila-
delphia.

TEAM TO BE SENT

New Classification Seems to
Be Pleasing to Athletic Au-
thorities Here—-W. & J. Not
Likely to Compete at Phila-
delphia This Spring. ,

The Athletic Association of the
University of Pennsylvania will give
its ‘Seventeenth _ Annual Intercollegiate
and Interscholastic Relay Race Meet-
ing on Saturday, April 29th, open to
all the colleges andlunive-rsities of
the United States and Canada. There
will be three races to determine the
College Championship of America,

“and they will be open to any college

or university that desires to “enter.
One race will be for a distance of a
mile, each man to run a quarter-mile.
The second race will be a four-mile
r-ace, each man to run a mile. The
third race will be a two-mile race,
each man to run a half-mile. The
Universitygof Pennsylvania will be
found in all three, and it is expected
that Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell,
Columbia, Chicago, Michigan,
consin, etc., will also ‘enter them.

T-here will be, in addition, a ‘num-
ber of other races between colleges.
An effor't has been made to arrange
colleges in groups that are about
equal in strength. .

The Relay Races have now become
so well known that all the» leading col-
leges and schools with hardly an ex-
ception are on hand. The'lchampion-
ships and special events are very, high
class, while. the group races are most
interesting. Over 200 teams have
be-en present for several years, mak-
ing this the biggest mee't of the year.‘
To "be absent from the Relay Races
is to miss an athletic treat.

The following prizes are awarded:

A silk banner will be given to the
winning team as a college trophy, and
to each member of the winning team
a gold watch. To each of the mem-
‘bers of the ‘team that ﬁnishes second,
a silver cup. Cups will be given as
third prizes. If.o-nly three colleges
are able to enter the race, a silk ban-
ner will be given to the winning team
and a ‘old watch to each of its mem-
bers. Second prizes will be given
when four teams contest, third prizes

T. Allen Burns Speaks
On. College Loyalty

Member of Civic Commission
Delivers Keen Address on a
Subject Most Vital to Univer-
sity Students.

T Allen Burns, of the civic com-
mission addressed the students of the
college schools of engineering, mines,
economics and education last Friday
morning on the theme of college loy-
alty. Th'e remarks of the speaker
were so near the real conditions in
the University of Pittsburgh, that one
was almost impressed with the pro-
phetic powers of Mr. Burns. The
main point made in ‘the talk-was, that
everything ‘depends on th‘e spirit of
devotion to the University or college
in whose classes the student is work-
ing for perfection. The wonderful re-
sults of sticking together, of schol-
astic or collegiate team play were ef-
fectively ldemonstrated to those pres-
ent last Friday morning. The condi-
tion of Chicago University some years
ago was made use of as a parallel to
our own institution of the present day.
The desire of the Chicago student to
ge‘t together for mutual beneﬁt in the
chapel assembly an-d other convoca-
tions of University character was
strongly brought out, as the keynote
of the success of the Chicago men and
women. A

Mr. Burns was most convincing in
his arguments and it was clearly evi-
dent to his hearers, that his words
were accentuated by sinceri'ty. The
fact that the grind of the college goes
out into the world in the same ca-
pacity was a remark most telling in
force; many’ of the faculty members
present may have raised an objection
to the statements made, but. it is

doubtful if anyone could very well
refute the declarations oﬁered by Mr.
Burns.

Track Manager is Planning for
Big Meet Held on Schenley
Oval Under Auspices of the
University.

The manager of the track team is’
already at work sending out the invi-
tations for the annual collegiate and
scholastic mee't held in Pittsburgh
every spring under the auspices of the
University. This year it is hoped to
make the event the most successful in
years, by having a larger entry list
and many more events of interest to
special classiﬁcation
having been made this spring in the
size of ‘the various high anld prepara-
tory schools of thestate. 1

Formerly the scholastic teams were
in one class, without regard to size or
ability. but this year it «is expected to
place all the teams of equal strength
in one class, while ‘those supposed to
be somewhat weaker will be anranged
in a ‘suitable place. It is easily seen
how the smaller schools will be ben-
eﬁted by_ the new idea of the track
authorities, as it will give all an equal
chance to obtain some glory.

The usual number of invitations
have been sent to the colleges over
the sta'te and it is hopeld to have an
even larger representation than in
former seasons. W. & I. will likely
send her accustomed quota of track
men, which means the best to be sure;
Allegheny, Wooster, Tech, Grove
City, Waynesburg and the lothen’
Western Pennsylvania institutions
will be on hand with a large entry
list.

As formerly the meet will be con-
ducted at the Schenley Oval.

RE-EXAMS KEEP SOME BUSY.

Last Term Debts Are Paid Saturday
Morning By Delinquent Students.

The students who failed to take
their exams last term were very busy
last Saturday morning taking off the
olld debts formed in the past three
months. The occasion was the hold-
ing of the re—exams for the fall ‘term.
N-ot very many students were forced
to take the tests as most every one
managed to be on ‘time at the Christ-
mas festival.

Pitt Students Will Benefit

Dr. Ziegler of Medical School
Faculty Speaks F avorably of

Latest Acquisition to Univer- ‘

sity.

If a report presented by Dr. Charles
Edward Ziegler is adopted by the
trustees of the Magee estate, Pitts-
burgh will soon have the finest mater-
nity hospital in the United States. The
institution planned by Dr. Ziegler will
c-ost $500,000 and will be constructed
and conducted along the lines of the
famous Frauenklinik institutions in
Europe.
ly to the‘ ‘treatment of maternity and
gynecological cases.

While the plans for the new hospi-

tal call for an exceptionally interest-

ing and much needed institution, it is
believed they are somewhat broader

in their scope than those outlineld 

the will of the la't~e C. L. Magee, the
donor. The erection of a student
wing, where medical students of the
University will be accommodated and
will receive practical elducatio-n, is in-
cluded in’ the recommendations of Dr.
Ziegler. An amphitheater where stu-
dents .may congregate and witness

operations would be constructed in
this wing.
A University's Advantage. \

Dr. Ziegler, aside from being in
charge of the Elizabeth Steel Magee
Hospital, occupiesthe chair of ob-
stetrics in the University. Already

valuable instruct-ion has been given to’

many students at the present Magee
Hospital, conducted by Dr. Ziegler in
“The Maples,”- formerly the Magee
home at Halket an~d‘Forbes streets.

Another departure from the original
idea for the hospital will be the ac-
commoilation of private, or pay, pa‘-
tients. Exceptional attention will be

given to this feature of the work in
the proposed institution.

Dr. Ziegler presented his report to
the trustees upon his return from a
tour of inspection of maternity hos-
pitals in other cities. The report has
not been acted upon by the trustees
and has not been ma'de public. How-
ever, sufficient has been.learned from

Carnegie Tech Journal Sharply

Criticises Pitt Rooting at Recent
Game in Garden.

 

iCarnegie Tech pla-yed the University

- of Pittsburgh a game of basketball at

Duquesne Garden last Friday evening.

. The game was a good, clean exhibition

of sport and, although fouls were fre-
quently called the spirit shown by both
ﬁves was._open and sportsmanlike. In
spite of the intense rivalry, the Pitt
team -played in a manner creditable both
to themselves and to -their Alma Mater.
It is’ to be deplored that the same can-

not be said for the crowd of alleged

Pitt students, who were allegedly root-

. -ing for the Pitt team.

 

-Cheering for the team representing
the_ Alma Mater is the most popular
‘form of sch-ool spirit. Rooting has won

many games and the roo‘-ter has come-

to-be almost as important a factor. in
Wi.nning games as the te-am itself. How-
evef‘, there is a vast difference be-
tween. honest cheering, honest encour-
agement, and the disgraceful hooting
and jeering of the opposing side to
which we were subjected last Friday
evening. All through the second half of
the game, cries and cat—calls from the

_Pi.t_t side of. the ﬂoor’ greeted every Car-

-negie cheer. Even several rounds of
cheers for. our opponents failed to
show them the discourtesy in which
they were indulging. The fact that
Tech was the visiting team makes the
misconduct all the more reprehensible.

VVe feel sure that the aggregation of

so—called rooters who were supporting -

the Pit-t team that night. were not rep-
resentative University of Pittsburgh stu-
dents. _ i

It is up to the Pitt men who really
care for their’ school to abolish such
rowdyism which does not injure any-
one but themselves and which giv-es
them a bad name that they-probably in
no way deserve. --Tartan.

Geneva Plays Pitt Friday

Recent ljefeat of Varsity Ought
To Mean a Fast Game in_ the
Garden Friday Evening.

The basketball schedule‘ will be re-
sumed this coming Friday evening,
when the second game with Geneva
College is played at the Gardens. The
Beaver Falls Colleg-ians defeated the
Varsity on their own floor on a recent
date by a score of 18 to 12. The Blue
and Gold is out for revenge this time
and agoold game may be expec'ted
Friday evening. ,

The basketball team ‘has been show-
ing unusually good form for the little

limited facilities at their command.
The game with Tech, while not as
fast as it might have been, was a good
example of ‘the never die spirit." The
Skibo lalds had the game well in hand
during the ﬁrst half and were con-
tent to saunter along in the second
period, but to their dismay they founld
the Pitt ﬁve to be hard at work trying
to overcome the lead wi'th the result
already known.

Captain Weger has undoubtedly the
foundation of a fast and aggressive
team, which would be able to hold its
own with any of the ‘college ﬁves, hald
it suitable quarters to practice daily.
Fortunately the day is not far distant
when the Trees gym. will overcome all
the difficulties of improper ﬂoor facil-
ities. T

indoor meet to be held at the Garden
on the 10th of March. The meet will
be entirely indoor in character, but it
will enable ‘the coach to get some idea
of the new candidates’ strength in the
various events on the program. It is
likely a relay team will be entered
along with the'dashes and the other
events of the evening. Active prepara-
tion for the meet will start in a short

The Red and Black, of VV. & J. Col-

columns last week: “Will \/V. & I. meet
Pitt on the gridiron this year? This is
a question which is troubling lovers of
football in this vicinity. Various ru-
mors liave been going the rounds to the-
effect that the Pittsburghers intend to
omit W. & J. from their list this year.
No satisfactory reason has yet been as-
signed ‘for such a step, but the report
is lent color by -the fact -that as yet the
Pitt athletic authorities have made ab-
solutely no overtures for a game with
the Red and Black. It is said that the

in this case W. & I. might have to_ be

usual one, and mighit even be dropped
altogether. It is safe to say, however,

as usual, notwitghs-tanding all reports to
the contrary. ‘

choice of three dates, and it is entirely
probable that one of them will be ac-

Rule of Senate is Carried Out
By Sophomores Last-_ Monday
Morning.

 

 

Not a li‘ttle stir was caused last
week by the edict of the senate, that
the Freshmen must wear _-their green
caps until the 20th day of this month.
The Sophomores lined up for action
last Monday morning prepared to
carry out the wish of the student law-
makers anld they were not idle in‘ their
wish for something to happen. The
Freshmen appeared for classes with
their usual attire on top, but, it was
not long until caps were decidedly un-
stylish ind the waving lock of brown
or red hair was much more effective
in the way of a color scheme. In
other words, the second year men
were not slow in conliscating‘ the
headgear of the Freshmen, to such an
extent ‘that it was only proper to ap-
pear hatless in the absence of any
other covering. ' G

The members of the two classes

took the fun very goodnaturedly and 2

no Idisgraceful scenes were enacted by
the contesting students. The F‘.1"esh-
men are going about bareheaded to
classes, because many of ‘the green
caps were destroyed at Christmas-
time, most of the Freshmen thinking
the custom officially ended at the
holidays.

The senate has requested the 1914
men to wear ‘their caps or go hatless
until the 20th of February when the
regular Fresh. cap night will take
place.

6 e an ‘IL 0 was mgton ?preser1't at the lllltlal meeting of the

 

and Jefferson College has the following
to say concerning the joint concert
between Pitt and W. & J. in the near
future: .

“The recent announcement of the
proposed joint concert between VVash-
ington and Jefferson and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh musical clubs
seems to be the ﬁrst attempt to create
amicable relations between the two
ins'tituti'ons since they first met
twenty years ago as rivals on the grid-
iron.

Ever since the first football game
was played the two schools seem to
have had a natu:ral antipathy for each
other, which in t-he years that have in-
tervened, has been greatly aggravated
by unsavory accusations by suppor't—
ers of both teams concerning athletic
methods, until it hasibecome, to say
the least, an unwholesome rivalry}
The state of affairs is to be deploreld
and the efforts of the managers of
the two musical clubs to bring ‘the
men of both schools together in social
relations is a commendable move.

Washington and Jefferson and the
University of Pittsburgh have always
been and always will be rivals anld no
student of either institution would
have it otherwise. The many and
varied ba‘ttles that have been fought
on the athletic lield has proven this
beyonkl a doubt, but there is no reason
why the men of both schools should
not have a better and clearer under-
standing of each other. This can only
be brought about by personal con-
tact strch as can be had by the pro-
posed meeting of ‘the musical clubs,
anid for that reason we hail with joy
the coming concerts.”

Monday proved to be a day of rare
goold fortune to the University stu-
dents. as two noted guests were
present to ‘address the chapel gather‘-
ing in the persons of Daddy George,
of George Junior Republic fame and
State Secretary Robbins, of the stu-
Uent Y. M. C. A. The only unfortu-
na'te part of the program was the
fact that ‘two such men were present
on the same day. It was a pleasure

for many of the students to see Mr. :
George, about whom so much has;
been written and said that one almost
feels that an acquaintance is formed
before seeing the man. l't is
needless to say the remarks of the
speaker were very much anoreciated
as the applause given at the conclu-
sion of both adldresses was suﬂicient
evidence of "the appreciation of the’

A CRYTNG NEED.

.n.

- Mr. H. All4eniB~uriis in a chapel ad-
dress last week hit the problem of stu-
dent life in the University of Pitts-

_ burgh fairly on the head by saying that
‘student assembly is the secret of suc-

cess in an institution the size of this_
The woeful falling off in chapel attend-
ance has brought about a decay of Stu-'
dent interest that cannot be computed
by mere words. i The fact cannot be

A. disputed that the disregard of the uni-
_versity assembly three mornings in the

week is, if for no other reason, a plain
evidence, that the students do not want

to take pride in the affairs of the Uni-

versity -of Pittsburgh. The manor wom-

an who prefers to devote the chapel

hour to study or personal recreation is

-just -the type, of humanity that Mr.

Burns very properly deﬁned as selﬁsh.
Possibly that seem-s a harsh term to'ap—
ply to a man or woman broad—minded
enough to be seeking a liberal educa-
tion; but, the fact remains that such is
exactly the case, when a noted speaker
or lecturer is cast aside to prepare a
lesson that should have been attended
to the night before. The speaker Fri-
so
many words, but, from the expressions

T ‘he used, it was‘ divined that college team

play is just .as_ important as the aid
given to a football orbasketball player
in an athletic contest. That is what the
University of Pittsburgh above all things
needs; we are entirely too narrow; We
are not working as hard for Alma
Mater, as we are striving to gain
knowledge to make our way successful-
ly in the world. “The grind is not
every thing,” as Mr. Burns very aptly
said the other morning: he is thegrind

in college and the grind out of the
shadow'of the college walls. The sig-V
niﬁcance of the remarks made last

week can -hardly be appreciated in such

_ a brief resume as this, but the thought

to be remembered is, that the university
is, falling into the rut of carelessness
and indifference to community affairs in
the every—day college life. Our chapel
exercises are not up to former stand-
ards; our student organizations are not
as virile as they might be and our in-
dependent thought is not as active as it

.5 i

should be.- The time to change is now,
not tomorrow or next week, but at the
very moment start out to help the com-
munity affairs of the University of
Pittsburgh by forgetting yourself and
working ‘for the beneﬁt of your fellows?

 

THE DENTAL SCHOOL.

The dental school of the university
places the study of dentistry in a log-
ical position in the western part of
Pennsylvania, because the lar.ge area of
the_'Pittsburgh district is covered fully
by the existence of the school. The
dental school of the University of
Pennsylvania forms the other part of
the double system, that should exist in
the Keystone State. The very fact that
the University of Pittsburgh must sup-
ply the dentists of the western section
of the State implies one exceedingly
powerful consideration, and that is, that
the school should be the The
present quarters of the schobl are quite

best.

other college year will likely ﬁnd the

dental students in the ﬁnest quarters
devoted to the study of dentistry in this
country. The new building, it is said,
will outrank any of the existing insti-
tutions of its kind.

T THE FOOTBALL SCHEDULE.

From the preliminary announcements
made by the graduate manager in foot-
ball it is surmised -that the university
will have a schedule next fall far in ex-
cess of the list provided last year. The
first statement shows the Carlisle In-,
dians to have been booked for a gamei
in October, which is a considerable ad-
dition to the card of last fall. The
Georgetown University team was ex-"
pected to ﬁll the position of the Indians,
and from early indications they seemed
to possess the necessary qualiﬁcations
but the playing of the contest revealed
the weakness of the eleven in‘com—.
parison to the Red men.‘ Two yearsl
ago the Indians were defeated by a de-‘
cisive score, which caused -the university
stock to go up considerablv and surely

the record of last season ought to be‘
sufﬁcient evidence that we will try trl
do the same thing again. The_ Weeklyi
published a report last week concerning!
the scheduling of a game with Penn',i

and, as was thought, the matter proved;

to be the sensation of the week. Sev-;
eral inquiries have been made regard 1
ing the authenticity of the report, and}
we can only say the statement appeared 
in the Pittsburgh Dispatch under zwi
Philadelphia date line, which may or,
may not b-e correct. Manager Hurst;
has not divulged any of the

other 
games, but it is to be taken for granted 
that State College and W. & I. will,
form two of the other strong attrac-it
tions, along with a western college not»
absolutely known at this writing, buff

OUR DISSENTERS.

The Wieekly has had the pleasure of
publishing during the last few weeks
the wri«t‘r.e‘n expressions of several of the
students along lines of undergraduate
activity. It has been really gratifying
to note the interest displayed by those
who oppose our ideas in certain affairs.
It is an old raxiom that there are al-
ways two'sides to a story, and if it
were not true, there would not be very
much fun in this life for any of us. It
is the bringing out of the student opin-
ions that we are striving to obtain;
the man who is content to straggle
along in the same moss-grown path
never wears his shoes out by fast
walking, that’s sure. The editors of the
Weekly have been roundly criticised, it
is admitted, but "after all the university
needs a little knock, now and then, to
keep its blood circulating. Last week
we printed a general depreciation of
the student organizations, and the
writer of the article, the editor of the
week, was refreshingly candid in all hr
said. Today a re-ply to the article ap-
pears in these columns, which is given
equal prominence with the statement of
last week. The correspondent takesiia
large—sized rap at the editors of the
Weekly, and we admire the "courage
shown by thewriter, but the fact must
be remembered that We, too, are stu-
dents, and therefore subject to our own
criticisms. It is the suggestions of the
students we are looking for; they will
at all times receive a warm welcome.

Needless to say, the speaker last Fri-
day morning made a number of burn-
ing remarks.

W. & J. elected a manager and coach

last week. They always look out for.

the morrow at Washington, it seems.

Those fellows generally noted for
their ability to ﬁnd the studies in which
an easy credit can be picked up,"are
not making any headlong dashes into the
Sanskrit course. I .

Not very many climaxes are being
capped in Freshmen English at thr
present time. . A

DENTAL SCHOOL IS REVIEWED

 

Facilities on the Bluff Are Not Equal
To Modern Methods in Vogue at
the Medical School.

The Dental Department of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is situated at the
corner of Bluff and Pride streets.

VVhile this building has a ‘good exte- _

rior appearance, it does not compare
with the new white building of the new
site. i

The south windows of this structure
face the Monongahela river, and the

View afforded is a splendid one; the

other windows overlook the downtown
section of Pittsburgh, whose ragged sky-
line of towering new buildings and
lower ones of an earlier date afford a
beautiful View on a bright day and a
correspondingly ugly one on a_ “Pitts-
burgh” day. The varnished wood of the
interior does not have the prep=ossess-
ing appearance of the marble and bronze
of the new buildings, but it is just as
serviceable.

The two upper ﬂoors are occupied by

‘laboratories and lecture rooms, which

are used by both the dental and phar-
macy students, different hours for lec-
tures, study and laboratory work being
allotted to each. The top ﬂoor contains
a lecture room, ofﬁce and pharmaceu-

tical laboratory, the equipment in these

rooms being the best. ‘

The third floor contains a.students'
museum, a laboratory of chemistry, the
library of the department and a lec-
ture room. On the next floor is ’O3
hall,’ the trustees"ofﬁce and a students’
room. The latter has lockers around
the walls and one side is taken up by a
lunch counter. ' _

On the ﬁrst ﬂoor is the inﬁrmary, in
which the members of the Senior class
treat their patients. \

The students of the collegiate, _engi—

neering, mines andmedical departments

look forward to the day when a new
dental building will occupy a promi-
nent position on ithecampus—when the
students of all ‘departments can form

at their respective buildings and march

in a body to Tree’s Stadium and cheer
the varsity on to -victory. R

With W. & J.

Combined Musical Clubs to Give
Concert in Pittsburgh During
Spring Term-—Would Be a
Success. ’

From unauthoritative sources it is
learned that the combined musical clubs

of the university and W. & J. College

will participate in a joint concert during
the spring term. The importanceof
such a measure is evident to the students
of both institutions, because it brings
the social side into prominence, which
has been altogether too slight in the
past. A joint concert with the Red and
Black in this city would be unquestion-
ably .a ﬁnancial success, as both the uni-
versity and the college have a large
number of supporters in Pittsburgh. The
combined efforts of the State and Pitt
clubs at Thalnksgiving was one of the
most pleasing musical events of the
earlyseason, because the usual rivalry
of the colleges was displaced by the
exhibition of the best student attain-
ments. Doubly more enjoyable would
such a -performance be with our rivals
of old from \/Vashingiton, Pa. The man-
agers of the respective clubs have a
bring about
much good by the proposed joint con-
cert.

The invitations for the .Junior Prom.
are being sent out by ‘the committee

this year are exceptionally neat and
clever, the execution being above the
average.

The Prom. will take place on 'the

evening of the 17th of February at
the Rittenhouse, and will be in keep-
ing with all the recent Proms. The
assessment being made is four dol-
lars. .
The stuldents of the university
should make it a special point to be

year.

University Gains Advantages

that the proposed institution, if con-
structed along the lines he advocates,
will not have its equal in the United
States. ’

“I have presented my report to the
Magee trustees but nothing will be
made public until they have passed
upon it,” declared Dr. Ziegler.

Expensive Maintenance.

The hospital proposed by Dr. Zieg-
ler will be a most expensive institu-
tion from the standpoint of mainten-
ance. It will likely be conduc'ted
along the lines of a surgical institu-
tion, because obstetrics are now
classed by physicians as surgery.
Surgical institutions-are far more ex-
pensive to maintain than ordinary
hospitals. “ ,

It will likely be some time before
the pvroposed hospital is constructed.
Dr. Ziegler declared that an architect
had not yet been secured. The pa-
tients who would be used for educa-
tional purposes, he said, would be
the charity patients.

The stud.ent senate of the univer-
sity will give the first students’ dance
;this coming Saturday evening in the
lassembly room of Thaw Hall. The
jdance will be strictly informal, anld
will be held for the purpose of ac-
quainting the students in a social way.
The hops were given with much suc-
cess last year, and should prove
equally as attractive this winter. A

Suitable music and all the appoint-
ments of a dance will be provided.

The senators were a triﬂe slow in
announcing their plans for the winter,
but it appears as if they mean busi-
ness, and it is now up to the students
to lend the proper encouragement by
liberally supporting the senate dances.

To the Editor of The Pitt Weeklyzi

’ In The Pitt Weekly, issued January

sic Society, the Science Club, the

Classical Club and the Y. M. C. A. re-

ceived their due amount of criticism.

which the “Weekly” has manifested
in’ the student organizations, but he
feels tha't they are in need of another

A ruthless stonm may test a build-

cause criticisméalone will not do it.

existence), but wh-en it came to the

Be Sure to Buy an Owl

Chancellor A McCormick ‘Takes
Opportunity to Suggest _ Pur-
chase of the Year Book—Do
It Now.

Chancellor McCormick the other
morning very vigorously advocated the
purchase of the 1912 Owl, stating that

I the students -should make sufﬁcient al-

lowance for the book in making up
their budgets. The remarks of the
chancellor seem to be very pertinent,
for the simple reason that the’ Owl is
a student publication reﬂeoting the life
of the. University of Pittsburgh, fro-m
the brightest to -the darkest shades. The

_ men elected to positions on the editorial

or managing board are working with
might and main to produce something
worth while. The only rewardthey re-
ceive is the appreciation of the stu-
dents, when the book ﬁnally comes out
and even then the appreciation is sadly
demoralized by a lot of individuals too
stingy to i1Iv-est in a copy, depending

entirely on the good nature of-a neigh—,

bor to steal a glance ‘big enough to
raise a knock that will be heard all over
the university. If every one bought an
Owl, that species of human nature
would soon be eliminated in this in-
stitution. This does not apply to the
1912 Owl alone, but to every year book
from, the preesnt time .to the end of
time, if you put it that way. i

The price of -the Owl is two dollars
and from the slight advance informa-
tion the V\’eekly has had, it is going to
be worth every cent of the‘ two dollars
andpa great dealimore. Ifyou have not
already signed a subscription" blaxnk.
now is the time to do it!

ter body will concur. It is learned
unofﬁcially that the co'ach—manager

ranging for a student assistant man-

The Cap and Gown Club meets this
evening in Thaw Hall at 8io’clock and
it is {desired that all the members be
present, as business of importance is
to be taken _up. As was announced in
a recent number of -the Weekly, the
club hopes to be the best this year it
can possibly make itself. The only
way ‘this result can be attained is by
the absolute co-operation of all the
students of the University in all de-
pa.'rtmen»ts.l It is not necessary that
every one have sufﬁcient talent to be
a star, but, it is necessary that every
man take it on himself to do the very
best he can. .

The club has secured a ldirector,
who is said to be the most capable it
is possible to obtain in this city.
Measures have been taken to form as-
sociatei membesrship in order tha't the
men in charge may have an oppor— '
tunity to work on a ﬁrm ﬁnancial
basis. Many other plans of equal ef-
fectivenesshave been started, so that
it is clearly a case of. the students
jumping in and making things hum
for the Cap anld Gown Club.

CHEERLEADER AT THEPGAMES.

Suggestion is Offered That Cheer-
lealder Take Full Charge of Basket-
ball Rooting in the Future.

 

_ The suggestion has been sent the
lWeekly that ‘the cheerleader be
present at all the basketball games in
the future, in order to regulate the
student applause. It appears, as if
the recent efforts of the men attend—;
ting ‘the games has not been concen-
trated in the right direction andiif the
cheerleader were present, he would be
able" to direct the songs and yells. The
rooting at the Tech game was not by
any means up to University standards
and the next time ‘the real spirit
should be shown by having the affairs
lead in the right way.

This is written at the instance of
,several stuidents and not through the;
ldesire of the editors to dictate the
!policy of the cheerleader.

School of Pharmacy

The University of Pittsburgh offers instruction in eleven thoroughly
organized schools; ' ‘

The courses in the School of Liberal Arts are organized according to
the group system which provides broad general culture as well as the oppor-
tunity for specialization in the latter part of the course. '

% A full college course for the training of teachers is offered in the
School of Education. Educational theory based on the newest conceptions
of science, and professional skill developed by unusual facilities at the com-
mand of the University serve as the basis of this course.

The co-operative plan by which students are given practical work _in
manufacturing plants will be put into operation in the School of Engineer-
_ing in the fall of 1910.

New buildings in the new location in Oakland were occupied by the
College, School of Engineering and the School of Mines in September, 1909-

A new building for the School of Medicine has been erected on our
University campus in Oakland and is now in use.

% A new Gymnasium and Athletic-Field will be constructed during the
present year and will be ready for use in September, 1911.
