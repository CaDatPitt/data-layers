“It could be a negotiation device
with the Russians,” said former

‘ NASA director James C. Fletcher at

Benedum Hall Auditorium this Sat-
urday. Fletcher was speaking at the
Space Technology Seminar of Pittfs

, Engineering Alumni Association.

The proper name for the “Star

_ Wars” plan is Strategical Defense

Initiative. The key words on the pro-
gram came from Reagan’s speech in‘
October of last year: “We ought to
shift from offensive use of our wea-

. pons to defensive.” Fletcher was one

oftheiscientists andiresearchers who
laid out the program after a deep
and long discussion with the joint
chiefs of the president's staff. The
finished product was a seven volume

The history of concepts ofra stra-
tegic defense is a long one. In 1944,
the Germans developed the V-2
rockets, which started the true
meaning of “Star Wars,” according

« to Fletcher. In /1969, the Safeguard

concept, which was an interceptor
device used against re-entry vehicles,
was introduced. However, in that
same year, the ‘Safeguard program
was scratched by the United States.
At the present time, the Russians
have one Safeguard system around
Moscow. The United States none.
Fletcher described the “Star
Wars” defense system." He described
it asajmulti-tier, Smulti-phase sys-
tem. T-he multi-tier system means
that U.S. has a ‘shot at the enemy’s
weapons, to assess whether to des-
troy them again and again. The sys-
tem is 90 percent effective for each

tier. Fletcher said, “We call the sys-
tem: shoot, look, shoot, look,
shoot."

Fletcher also said that four ele-
ments_are needed for effective space
weaponry. First,. one must have sen-
sors to locate the missile and detect
where it is going. Second, one needs
a pointing device to point the inter-
ceptor- at the desired_ target. Third,
one needs a weapon, and fourth, a
battle management system to pass
all information to the next phase.

The conventional way of firing
missiles are from pop-up systems
from ground -into ‘space. What
Fletcher proposed is to have sensors
put into space to track any Soviet
missile attacks on the U.S. He stated
that these systems to be put in space
are anti-nuclear. The main purpose

to counter attack the lCBMs coming

Shouts of “Answer the question!"
from a crowd of GSPIA students

summed up the atmosphere of their‘

meeting” with Provost Roger Ben-
jamin Saturday morning. The pro-
-vost agreed to meet with students in
Forbes Quadrangle to discuss his
proposal last
GSPIA. At 10:30 a.m. Benjamin

entered a packed lecture room‘ of
graduate students eager to listen to.

the details of the provost’s evalua-
tion procedures and long-term goals
that led to the proposal. Benjamin,
however, avoided any details, and
the mood of the meeting became
increasingly hostile during the 90
minutes of his stay. ‘
Benjamin started the meeting with

an air of confidence that quickly

turned to frustration as students
demanded specifics of the task for-
ce’s survey used to evaluate GS PlA‘s
faculty. .

Upon entering the room, the pro-
vost asserted that he, too, was an
almunus of a school very similar to
the Graduateschool _of Public and
"International Affairs and that no
personal feelings against_the school
existed in the provost’s office. “Pro-
vosts don’t always happen to be peo-
ple involved in public affairs
themselves," he assured. “I don’t
mind "being asked embarrassing
questions."

The audience of graduate students
quickly took -advantage of the

‘opportunity to clarify questions that
have remainedunanswered since the
announcement of the proposal last
Thursday.’ The question of funding
and the expense of GSPIA being
factors in deciding its dissolvement,
a question which neither the provost
nor the dean ofGSPI’A, Lean Haley,
had commented on before, was
finally answered. “Yes,” said Ben-
jamin, “that is one ofthe measures."
He described the matter of reorgan-
izing the school as one of“compara-

ltive advantage." _ A '

The validity of the assessment
done th-is year by the provost’s task
force was the major question at

Saturday’s meeting. Despite the pro- I

vost's denials to the contrary, there
is continuing suspicion among stu-
dents and faculty that GSPIA is
being singled out to effectively elimi-
nate some tenured faculty. This left
the question of fairness in the assess-
ment process to be stressed’ by

' students.

“Quality is one ofthese very, very
interesting concepts,” replied Ben-
jamin to a question about the inter-
pretation of GSPIA’s evaluation
results. When an angry student
asked Benjamin how they could pos-
sibly co_mpare"a professional school

-such as GSPIA to other -'non-

professional schools for scholastic
output, Benjamin had no reply but,’
“They just did it."

According to Benjamin, “The
game is.to move from where we are‘

to a more reputable academic insti-
tution.” Benjamin stated that the
university’s graduate schools should
develop an immediate local‘ angle,
and programs such as economies,
which will be of use to the Pittsburgh
community, will be radically
enlarged‘ in the future. One Ameri-

can student argues that because.

Pittsburgh is a growing interna-

tional administrative center GSPIA,"

already has very relevant local appli-
cations. She gave an example in the

former mayor of Pittsburgh and.

GSPIA graduate Pete Flaherty.
Benjamin» did not comment."

As verbal arguments became
more heated, the topic‘ of .the task
forces composition — the lack of
GSPIA students of alumni

became the focus of the meeting.’

Referring to‘the number ofauditors,
Benjamin stated that even “eighteen
is too many” and that. more repre-
sentatives would have been unrea-
sonable. The fact that the task force
contained, no students. or alumni,

some students fear, could have been’, S
‘ a source of misunderstanding ofthe '

methods and goals of the school.
The task force contained representa-

, tives from most of the departments
"in the university, one graduate and

one undergraduate representative.
The provost became increasingly
upset with demands from the stu-
dents for representation in future
decisions and questions concerning
abolishment of the name GSPIA,
which most feel carries 'the.reputa—
tion of the school. Students jeered

when the provost made a frustrated’,

comment to a question by Scott
Riback, a dual law-GSPIA student,

asking whetherhe would graduate_.

with a “GSPIA” degree as opposed
to one with the name of the school
proposed to take its place. “I don’t
know what the hell that’s supposed
to mean,” murmered Benjamin.
One lndian student attested to" the
importance of the name GSPIA in

her country and added that she had‘

left her husband and children to
attain a name and a degree from

GSPIA. Another student imme-'

diately added, “I think you fail to
recognize that you’re dealing wit
peoples’ lives.” - -

“If you're attacking my motives,
then I don't think we have much to
talk about,” said Benjamin.

‘ The meeting closed with the stu-
dents’ threatening to strike -today if
they were not represented in future
decision-making procedures of the
provost; “Could we please have

“This is an exciting time to be
around. I believe that 50 years from
now, the evolution theory will be a
footnotejn the textbooks —- a refer-
ence to something that used to be
believed.”

Dr. Bill Stillman presented his
views on creation science in a speech
sponsored by the Campus Crusade
for Christ Thursday night in the stu-
dent union. Stillman, a civil engi-
neer, gave a general overview of
some of the points of creation
science, as opposed to evolution
science.

Stillman, who earned his doctor-
ate at Ohio State University,
stressed his opinion that “ifthe Bible

is true, we must believe everything in,

it, and that includes the creation
aspect of it.” '

‘TheiPitt News-, Monday, Nov.ember"12, 1984

Creation discussed

The creationist also found fault in
today’s evolution teachings, stating,
“The evolution theory is constantly
changing in its presentation and in
its arguments when problems arise
"with it.” Darwin’s evolution theory,
the “survival of the fittest," said
Stillman, is nowgbeing criticized by
the scientific community, while
more new ideas are cropping up
every day.

Stillman described the scientific
theories of paleontologists as
“inconsistent," saying that evidence
such as the fossil record has “too
many gaps, and no transitions" to
support evolution effectively. What

they are saying, in effect, is that“

“amphibians changed into reptiles

and reptiles into mammals while
nobody was looking,” according to
Stillman. '
The evolutionists do have many
good arguments, said Stillman, but

seem to have no comment on
reproofs presented to them. In
Texas, footprints of humans and
dinosaurs appear to have been made
simultaneously; "the same pheno-
menon occurs with the fossil record

-of humans and trilobites in the

Sandstone Rocks of Utah. “When
confronted with these situations,"

said Stillman, “the scientists just
don’t want to talk about it. If some-
"thing is untrue, it should be dis-
proven, not ignored.”

‘ While making a strong argument
for creation science, Stillman
encouraged. people to weigh both
sides in their own minds and to make

a responsible decision; to find out
what they don’t know so the decision
is easier. “The evolution theory has
some good arguments, but many

aren’t proofs‘ —~ and the other side‘ .

has some very good arguments,
too.” «

This Saturday marked the crown-
ing touch to this semester’s activities
by the Air Force Reserve Officer
Training Corps at Pitt. After a. term
filled with lectures, parades and long
marching practices, the cadets

gathered at the Hilton Hotel down- _

town to celebrate the spirit of the
corps.

T The dinner also marked the arriv-I
al of the new commanding officer, '

Col. D.N'. Thompson, Director of
Aerospace Studies here at Pitt. Also
in attendance was an Air Force
three—star general.

Lt. Gen. H.O. Thomson, Director
for Plans and Policy of the Joint

Staff, Organization of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, spoke to the cadets
about their choice to enter a career
in the Air Force.

“If you start very early, have the
ability to make good judgments and

sound decisions, then you can work v

in the Pentagon,” said Thomson.
As director of Plans and Policy,
Thomson talked about the work

' done. by the Joint Chiefs leading up
to the Grenada conﬂict. “President,

Reagan called us in and saw a poten-
tial crisis. He said, “Let’s get a hold
of it, before it gets a hold of us.”

Thomson said the Joint Chiefs
had assembled the necessary infor-
mation for the president within 24
hours. “Grenada was not high on
our set of plans,” Thomson said,

- “and things we found were not

expected.” Citing the presence of a
Cuban combat battalion on the

.4

island, composed of many veterans
from wars in Africa, Thomson said,
“Cuba and Nicaragua are clients of
the Soviet. Union. They are export-
ing insurgency to El Salvador._ If we
don’t stop it, we’ll see this cancer
grow. ' ’

“Before a stable government can
be established, -we must control the
insurgency. We don’t
impose the military; that is only used
as a last resort," said Thomson.

“Today‘s world is the result of 35
years of work The longer we are
successful with deterrence, the easier
it 4 is to sustain peace,” Thomson
said. '

Following up his speach, Thom-
son called on the cadets to look into
themselves andgtheir personal reli-
gious beliefs. - '

“Personality grows through char- ‘

ac_ter; if you don’t have something
bigger and greater to look to, then
look inward." ‘ '

Fletcher talked about four phases
that the system would go through in
a full-scale nuclear attack. The
phases are as follows: The first phase
is.called the boost phase in which a
rocket from a silo burns out when it
reaches a certain altitude. It then
deploys warheads. The boost phase
lasts about three minutes.

The next phase is the post-boost
phase in which the missile is heading
for the target and carries all the war-
heads and decoys.

The midcourse phase, which lasts
20 minutes, is the longest phase. A

A . battle management satellite will then

differentiate the real warheads from
the decoys on a Russian missile. It is
almost impossible, Fletcher stated,
that the battle management satellite
can totally differentiate all the
decoys from the warheads. He esti-
-matedvthat 10 percent of the missiles
will get to the terminal (final) phase,
in which the ‘warhead enters the

forces?” asked the students.
Benjamin assured them that their

“recommendations would be consi- "

dered very carefully.”

GSPIA students, on the average, '

feel a slight satisfaction in the ﬁnal
outcome of Saturday’s meeting with
the provost. Most,_ though, are
unsatisfied with the lack of specifics
in Benjamin’s explanations. “It
didn't seem to me anything new was
said,” stated Ray Wuslich after the
meeting had closed. Most of the

, GSPIA students seemed to agree.

‘Star Wars’ defense advocated  

atmosphere and then hits its pro-
grammed target. At that time, a sur-
veillance aircraft will be on strategic
alert. “A surveillance aircraft is a
new element that has been added
since the Safeguard project. It (the
plane), also acts as a battle manage-
ment system,“ Fletcher said.

One or the space weapons that

Fletcher talked about developing is_

called a Directed Energy Weapon.
This weapon can be put into space
armed with lasers that are capable of

,“burning through” enemy aircraft

and missiles. It is effective during the
boost and post-boost phases. Non-
nuclear interceptors can also be put
in space that would be ‘effective
against missiles during the mid-
course and terminal phases.

. Fletcher also discussed a problem
that may arise with the defense sys-
tem. Other satellites are constantly
moving around inspace. This would

. make it diffucult for the battle man-

agement satellite to differentiate
between missiles and communica-_

tion vehicles. Fletcher proposed to

set up a satellite constellation for the
battle management satellite to com-
pute. The satellite is to be built in
space; it will remain stationary over
Russia.

Another weapon is the Strategical
Defense Initiative system that is

A composed of laser and particle beam

weapons to intercept and destroy
missiles. This is the main reason why
the politicians call this high-tech
defense system “Star Wars."

“We are only trying to prevent
star wars from happening by devel-
oping anti-ballistic weapons,”
Fletcher said. I '

According to Fletcher Mondale‘s

comments on the “Star Wars” issue -

during the debate with Reagaiiwere
false. Mondale's source on the “Star
Wars" topic came from a back-

ground paper that was written byia A

professor from MIT; the paper
wasn’t accurate.

When walking down a street in
Oakland one sees a variety in cloth-
ing styles: J ordache jeans and Lev1’s,

collar. Both ways might be com-
bined for an interesting effect.
Suits took on a fresh look this fall
especially when put together with
printed shirts and crocheted, narrow
ties; or plain shirts with printed ties.
Ties’ ends should be kept even and
not tucked into trousers. For colder

Yet, we need the big-name
designers so that we can follow the
new trends ,in ‘fashion. Fashion
shows provide an _insight on those
trends and Wednesday night at
Kaufmann’s Oscar de la Renta pres-
ented his fall collection for fashion-
conscious men.

As models walked down the run-

became apparent. They were
subdued greens and reds, all shades

show out of the suit. Trousers have
pleats and cuffs of 1.25 inches.
Waists are higher, legs fuller.

A different look this fall is that of
a slim-cut suit with square
shoulders, slightly nipped-in waist
and a front that is double-breasted
and generously cut.

For this‘ fall's evening wardrobe,
preferred were white shirts with
many collar choices. Oscar'de la

suits, a red cloth belt and red bow-
tie. For women, he suggested black

The general look was that of exag-
gerated proportions. Sweaters are
bulky, rugged and are to be layered.
For example: A rugged cardigan
was shown worn over a sweater vest.

For the outdoors, there were ﬂan-

Outerwear, again, was fuller.

Trenchcoats might have an added

scarves are everywhere. A white

scarf went especially well under the.»

The Pitt hockey team played twice

a this weekend, losing Friday at Gan-

non 4-0 and defeating West Virginia
Saturday at Lakevue Ice Arena l2-4.

Friday’s game at the civic center in
Erie, with a crowd of l,l00 Gannon
fans in attendance, was Pitt’s first
loss of the season. The encouraging
Erie crowd gave Gannon a slight
edge over Pitt. “The fans make a big
difference,” said coach Jim Owens
Sr. Unfortunately, due to the loca-
tion ofthe Panthers’ home ice, about
a half hour drive from campus at
Lakevue Ice Arena, many Pitt stu-
dents are unable -to attend ‘the
games. _ -

The ice was flying Saturday after-
noon when the Panthers returned
home to battle WVU at Lakevue.
The Pitt skaters, with the home ice
advantage, outshot their opponent
46-25. ' ’

“ln Friday’s game, we failed to
capitalize on some shots, and we
played with little orno intensity,”
said team co-captain Jim Lang._This
wasn’t true of Saturday’s_game and

‘ the Panthers’ momentum was strong

as Roger Oldaker and Jim Owens Jr.
both had hat tricks for Pitt with
three goals each. WVU shot its last
goal in the middle of the second
period but,Pitt, with a one-point
lead, scored an additional seven
goals. The 8-point victory was their
fourth win and highest score this
season.

One reason behind the success of

the Panthers is the ability of the .

team members to synchronize their

efforts‘. “Our lines work really well» 5

together," said right wing Roger
Oldaker. “lt'sjust a matter of know-

ing where everybody is.” This win is ,

especially significant to Oldaker,
who recently. transferred to Pitt

. from WVU, where he-played for the

Mountaineers.

The Pi_ttNews, Monday, November 1'i2,,_1984iyi Z '

Freshman center Jeff Bell, a

transfer student from Penn State j
and the newest member of the Pitt

hockey team, had two goals and four
assists. Bell, who skated his first
game with the team on Friday, had
little trouble showing off his abilities
in Saturday’s game and is already

proving to be an effective addition to»

the team. Bell stated that he likes
playing for the Panthers better
because “Pitt has a, more winning

atmosphere." , _
There are still a few weak spots in
the defense that the skaters would

like to remedy. “We give up the puck"

a little too much,” said center Jim

Lang. “We’re still not playing good ..

defensive hockey.”

The Pitt hockey team is having a
winning season and there will proba-
bly be more hardhitting, fast-skating
action from them in the future. The
Panthers will take on Wheeling on
Sunday at Lakevue.

Stick stuff: Left wing Torn Dief-
fenback was suspended for one
game on Friday after fighting with a

_ Gannon player. -

“It‘s my attitude that on any given
Saturday any given team can win,”
Aldisert said. “The senior class
hasn’t beaten Penn State, and it
would be nice to go out with a win.”

When asked what the win meant
to him personally, Fazio replied, “It
doesn't make a difference to me per-
sonally, but I don’t think it’s fair for
the players to get up and read about
such distractions, especially the Fri-
day before a game. I’m concerned
about the team. The coach is old
enough to take care of himself; I
knew there’d be games and seasons
like this when I got into it.”

The Panthers have next weekend
off before heading to State College,
and Fazio said that he would prefer
to play the Nittany Lions next week
but that the team would use the

lead this team to—no more than two
losses this season. “I thought we
played pretty well in the first half,
that was pretty evident. Our defense
adjusted well and Johnny Congemi
made the plays like the Johnny Con-
gemi of last year.” '

“Our intensity kept us in the
game,” fullback Marlon Mclntyre
said, fueling the belief that intensity
has been spotty as oflate. “Everyone
played with it. It helped us out
today.”

Several Panthers voiced annoy-
ance —- at best — over what tailback
Craig Heyward called “cheap shots”
by Tulane players. “They wanted us
to play their type of game,” said
lronhead, who led allrushers with
86 yards on 20 carries.

Fazio chalked up “a lot more talk-

all led up to a get-acquainted shov-
ing match in the third quarter, dur-’
ing which there were more flags
ﬂying than there are at the U.N. ‘
building.

“The football players were macho
out there. Our guys lost their com-

posure and got aggressive. [Tackle]

Randy Dixon wants to fire out and
kill the guy across from him,” Fazio
said, referring to one of several
offsides penalties. “You don’t do
that. Wally was telling his kids the‘
same thing. Just play. We settled
down. Kids after the game hugged
each other, kissed each other.”
Congemi was in no mood. After
firing a 16-yard pass at third-and-
one to Pat Schipani to spark the
2l-point surge, he spoke of remorse
for his aching frame. .
“I’m drained. My legs aren’t up to
par. Mentally, I tried to block the

Panthers leave
Congemi leads
Pitt over Green Wave

By Mark Slndler
The Pitt News

‘Owing to his weariness, John
Con'gemi chose the nearest available
seat. Given the chance, he'd have
lunged at the nearest available.
couch.

Congemi was that groggy and that

I . accomplished a quarterback Satur-

day afternoon at Pitt Stadium.
Starting, finishing and playing an
entire football game for only the
second‘ time this season, he rang_up

‘ 152 yards on 15 of 21 attempts to

‘lead the Panthers past Tulane2l—l0.
The last time Congemi had such a
performance was over” four weeks

‘ago when East Carolina came to
town. Two days ago, he was the driv- _

ing force behind Pitt's third win in
the past year, Army (November of

' last year) and East Carolina being

the others.

Behind 3-0 heading into the
second quarter, the Panthers ran up
the score to a,2l-3 lead by halftime,
though there was doubt Pitt would
win it for the seniors‘ last home game

when a Tulane lineman drove Con- _

gemi’s left shoulder into the turf
after an incomplete pass. “I watched
the ball go, then all of a sudden I was
hit in the back,” Congemi said. “I
had trouble lifting it when I got up.”

Just about every other area of
Congemi’s_body has been battered in
this 2-7-l season; this time, he shook
it off and three plays later tossed an
I l-yard touchdown pass to Bill Wal-
lace with "2226 to~go. The same con-
nection worked just as well 1:48
later, except that it was an eight-
yard spiral that gave Pitt its halftime
lead. '

Both scoring calls were audibles
and for several minutes brought
back the Congemi-‘Wallace glory
days of yesteryear as the split end led
all Pitt receivers with 43 yards.
“With Johnny back healthy," Wal-
lace admitted, “we felt comfortable
again as we did [last year]. We’ve
had less offense this yearwhen he's
been hurt. I

minded than most when it comes to

“I felt that we could [have done

“The problem was that Johnny was

_can happen.“ .
‘In that 2i-point scoring stretch in

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s swimming and diving team
continued its success in dual-meets
with an 81-59 defeat ofthe Michigan
Wolverines over the weekend. The
Lady Panthers put forth a solid team

effort as they clinched their second,

victory of the season.
Coach Dave Belowich was “very,

pleased" at his squad’s performance ‘

in what he described as “a really
good ,meet.”‘The score was close
throughout the entire meet. The
Lady Panthers needed some clutch

efforts by diver Jennifer Brown and O

- the 400-meter freestyle relay team to
seal the win in the end. / i

The meet started out with a Pitt
win. ‘The 400-meter medley relay
team comprised of Tracy Phister,
Jodi 0‘Neil, Alicia Dugan and
Susan Hickman opened the meet
with a win. Sue Heon and Hickman
added two more victories to the tally
as Pitt jumped out to a 23-2 lead
after the first three events.

27-16 after five events. '

The Lady Panthers and the Wol-
verines, both veteran squads, went
back and forth throughout the meet
until the score stood at 71-54 in Pitt’s

_favor. Michigan, -with two events

remaining, could not win but could
force a tie if they swept'the 3-meter
diving competition and won the 400
medley relay. _ _

The Michigan squad is nationally
recognized as having the best diving
team in the college ranks. The Lady
Panthers have two excellent divers

in Tricia Schultz and Tricia Ney, but _,

when the pressure was on, an unex-
pected ‘heroine emerged. In doing
what Belowich called “thebest div-
ing she has done in two .years,”jun-

ior Jennifer Brown surprised -
everyone and took second place in’

the 3-meter competition, preventing
a Michigan 3-meter sweep andicing
the victory for the Lady Panthers.
The Pitt 400 freestyle relay team‘ of
Marian Cassidy,, Dugan, Cindy
Rose and Hickman put‘ the final
touches on the victory as they ended
the meet the same way it started,
with a Lady Panther first-place

- finish.

Brown came through for the Lady
Panthers when they needed her, but
she credits team support the most in
helping her put forth herbest effort.

the meet, which featured some tense

atmosphere, Brown’s

reply was,
“We had a lot of fun.”
Brown is a perfect example of the

depth that is common throughout.

- first-place finishers are, the second-

and third-place finishersare also

has quite a supporting cast.

Swimmers-such as Cassidy, Dugan", A

Stacey Moller, Rose, Chris Kaucher

depth that has enabled Pitt to win

that he is “very pleased" with his
team’s performance so far this sea-
son. The Lady Panthers will begin

preparations for the Pitt Invita—'

Belowich promised, “We are in very,
very fine shape for the Pitt Invita-

on the solid effort against Michigan,
but this team can only get better and

Seniors
bid Pitt  
farewell

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Printed in big blue’ and gold letters

in the Pitt locker room are three"

words: PITT "IRON WORKS.
Something worked in Saturday‘s
final home game, a 2l-l0 victory
in Pitt Stadium.
Whether or not it was the iron
remains to be discussed, argued or
fought over, but -the team's success
held special significance for the
senior players. ’

“This game was extra important
for the seniors,” said head coach
F oge Fazio. “All the seniors played
so doggone well; it was the last game
and a great- victory. .

“These guys have worked hard,”
Fazio continued. “Thecrises they

I have endured didn’t build their char-

acter «simply because they had it
before they came.”

Senior fullback Marc Bailey felt
good about the game. “It feels good
to go out of Pitt a winner. Ithought
we started out sluggish, but we exe-
cuted well for most of the first half
and went in ahead. We put points on
the board when we needed to.”

Pitt scored three touchdowns in

the second quarter to run up a 21-3 - I

lead going into the locker room.
When the gun sounded, both teams
ran off the field, but the Panthers
stopped and made an about-face
when they realized three-time All-
America Bill Fralic was still’stand-
ing on the field. Number 79 was
being retired, which Fralic himself
was unaware of until minutes before

the game, and the players were never .

told about it.

“The Heisman and all those things —

are great,” Fralic admitted, “but this
honor means just as much toxme.
When you get something that only
Tony Dorsett, Hugh Green and Dan
Marino have gotten, it makes‘you

feel special. ‘It reminds me of what

we’ve done for four years.
_“lt’s great to go out with a vic-
tory," he continued. “We didn’t let

the slide or whatever you want to »

call it continue. It's hard to say if we

. let up in the-‘second half, but I think

that if we’d have had to score in the
fourth quarter, we would have. We
were concentrating on controlling

 the game." ~

“Bill’s performance on the field is

‘evidence of the «kind of athlete he's

been the past four years," Faziosaid.
“He deserves the recognition he’s
gotten.”

Caesar Aldisert and Chris Dole-
man, both sehiors, are optimistic
about the upcoming. Penn State
game.

“It felt good, saying goodbye and
all, but what can you say?” Doleman
pondered. “We’ve had some rough
times, but we're back on the winning

\ \

g track."
