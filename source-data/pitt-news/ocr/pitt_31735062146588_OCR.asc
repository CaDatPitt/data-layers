“Earn -While’ You" Learn”, sounds
like an advertisement for a‘corre‘s'-‘

of the advantages of a “Co-op” edu-
cation. , v
That the student may St .ure.su-
pervised training and industry,
thus getting practical experience
in his chosen profession, is the pur-
pose of' “co-op” work as conducted
in the Pitt engineering schools.
Sixty-ﬁve students have been as-
signedqto jobs this year under this
of engineering
education under Prof. J. W. Hal-
lock,‘ director, and E. Willis Whited,
assistant director. * . ‘
’ Observing of the" success of the
systeinpwhich was started in the
university. of Cincinnati in‘ 1910,
-Pitt became the second school in
the country to adopt it. There. are
new forty’ schools using the plan.
_The'student in co-op work is vis-
ited at frequent’ intervals by a
faculty member, who watches him
work, "asks questions and discusses
the work which the student is do-_'
ing, not onlywith the student, but
with the student’s employer.
Meanwhile the student although

ployee of the co-operating ﬁrm, re-
ceiving pay for his services and be-
ing‘ subject tothe provisions of the.
Pennsylvania workmen’s compensa-
tion law.’ _ _ .
.IStudent grades are based on a
written ‘report, describing the work
which is due at the end of the “co-
op”. period, and upon 'interviews-- ob-
-tained from the students and em-
ployers. P '_ V, V
Industries are interested‘ in the
‘,‘co-op” plan because it offers "op-
portunity for training future em-
ployees before they have graduated
from the University. It also gives
the“ sl:ud'en'tTopportunity- to confer
with the employer regarding, univer-
sity engineering work. , ' ' ,
‘Several of the corporations, to
which the University is obligated
to. ‘keep certain‘ co-operative posi-
tions continuously ﬁlled, are' the
Westinghouse E. and M. company,

Tube company, State Highway de-

Pittsburgh [Railways company,'; Du-
quesne-'Light ~. company, - National

partment, American Steel‘. and
Wire company, McClintic-Marshall
company, and several out-of.-town"

companies,‘ including the Studebaker.

pany, Goodyear Tire and Rubber
company, Firestone Tire and Rub-
ber company, and the General
Electric company. '

have been placed by this »depart-
ment, only two have been. killed;
one student because -of _his own.
carelessness. Another‘ died three
years" ago in a’ vain attempt-~ to
save another man's life.  . -
’That the student does real ‘wot ~
is shown in ’that'H., W. _Navergold,-

the dope by nosing out the first place
pre-business administration team in
_the last ten seconds of play. Busi-
ness administration walloped the
freshmen and the -German club
swamped .pre-legal juniors. This de-
feat at the hands of the Mellon In-
stitute boys drops ipre-business ad-
ministration from ﬁrst place and puts
the German club in_the lead.‘
. In the ﬁrst game business admin-
istration returned to their Old-time
form and walloped the freshmen,
21-5. The weak freshman team
failed to make the encounter inter-
esting at "any stage of the game.
Fast passing and quick footwork by
the business administration team
made the poor attempts ofthe fresh-
imen fruitless. It was business ad-.
ministration’s game from start b to
ﬁnish. The failure of the business
men to make more of their many
open shots count kept them from
running up a. larger score. Hartz,
freshman centeizgi collected the only
two ﬁeld goals for his team‘. This

for the ﬁrst year men, their only
win being 3. forfeit from the Ger-
man club. I ‘ —

The German club humbled -pre.-

‘team in the league; ‘The German

By this sweeping victory the‘ Ger-
man club vaults back into ﬁrst place,

for the rest of the season.

The ﬁnal game of the evening was
the closest and hardest-fought con-
test.- Alpha Chi Sigma. forced pre-
business administration’ out of ﬁrs:
_ The game
was hotly contested from the open-
ing whistle until the last ten seconds
_of play, when’, Peck, Mellon Institute
pivot man, dropped in the winning‘
goal on a close rebound from his
basket. At no time during the game
did either team show much superior-
ity. Both teams were quite evenly
matched and lady luck seemed, to
play a big role in the ﬁnal outcome
of the thrilling-. contest." Each team
made seven ﬁeld goals, but the Mel-
lon boys led at the free throw line
three to one. Although‘ the Alpha
Chi Sigma boys deserve. credit for
‘this win, they will buck up against
their toughest opponent of the sea.-

will almost decide. the championship
of the league. I _.

WINS   CAHAMPIOHNSHIPAS

 

 

 

Pitt swimmer who last week star-
tled Eastern swimming circles
with his record-breaking feats’ ‘on
two successive evenings, is not un-
accustomed Ato breaking records.

-While still in high school, “Pete”

brokemany marks,. ' -not only in
swimming, but in tra‘ck; and field
-athletics as well, for Bowen is
equally good in both.

The records Bowen held_ in track
and ﬁeld sports at East High, Erie,
when he entered Pitt,’_a lad Just-
.eighteen years of age, include 100-
yard dash, 9 4-5 seconds; 220-yard
dash, .22 3-5-seconds; 120-yard-high.
hurdles, 16 seconds ﬂat; and the
220-yard low hurdles, 26 1-5 sec-
onds. The Erie boy also held the
rec-
ord for the hundred y_ard_ breast
strlcike in swimming. Histime was
1: ., '

:In

practice at Pitt, Bowen broke
the.-"nter-collegiate 200-yard breast
stro e record of 2:42 '3-5. He al-
so holds the vunoﬁicial Pitt records
in-the 220 and 440-yard...free.-style
-swims. - - , 
Against Army last. Week, ..P_6te
broke’ the. cadets’ tank mar A
-the 220-yard breast stroke, going
‘the distance in 2:44 one and 3-5 sec-
-ands above the intercollegiate stan-
‘-dard. The night following this rec-_
ord performance, Bowen lowered the
‘Lafayette tank mark for the same
distance. _ . A _
.T.hat- Bowen will star .in A Pitt
track is also probable. AWhile a
‘freshman, the .'_‘.r1e lad swung
‘around the ‘indoor runway to break
the one. and-two lap Arecords of_

— many years standing.» The one lap

record ‘stands at 16 6.10 seconds,
and.«.the -two-lap at 344,-5 seconds.‘
.*iTh‘e-University" will send Bowen
to . the- Intercollegiate ‘swimming
meet to. be held in the New York

meet Bowen .wil.l have ‘another
‘chance to lower 'theAA.inter-collegiate
standard in his favorite swim’ event.

Delta Sig Floor Team
Leads Dental League

The Delta Sigs are still in lead
i'n'the dental league, thanks to a
lucky accident. ‘ On Monday night
of last week, the crack senior club
trailed the, Delta Sigs ’till. Within
‘forty-ﬁve’ .seconds of the time for
the_ ﬁnal whistle. Then -the excite-
mentbegan.‘ One ‘f the timekeep-
ers blew _his ,_whistle, announcing
the en'd of "the-‘game to all but-the’
players and the other timekeeper. _
Some fast action ‘then took -place

Delta Sigs, resultingin a tallyfor
the seniors.. The other timekeeper
blew ‘his whistle before anyﬁmore
scoring; could -take place and as far
as the players knew the seniors had
dethroned the leadeis‘ of the league.
Mullen, captain -of the Delta Sigma
Delta pasers,»learnedv of the time-
keeperfs discrepancies. -and immedi-
ately protested’ the“ game. Dr.
Sutherlandgdirectoi"bf the league,
sustained the--‘ protest with the re-
sult- that the Delt-a.Sigs are still
in the; lead, and there is one mo1‘e
game ‘to be replayed‘ after the
‘clo“s“ei-‘ of the. league ~season,.. Friday
':night-.-- -- - .— ‘
The seniors have a great combina-
“nation in Galbo, Mills, Christy,
Hank and Joe Schmitt, Bob Steele,
Steinburg, Kroll, Visley and Mayo.-
Mayo is one of the sensations of
the d_ental.lea‘gue, ha Jing Acaged ﬁf-
teen ﬁeld goals in the ‘last four
games. Mayo "will be remembered
to some as a varsityplayer of three
years ago. During the ‘le year of -A
his-«varsity cai'eer,.he participated‘ 
in ﬁfteen games, but did not re-
ceive his letter. Visley was a stel-

.Conduc-ls Course On _
Einstein Theory Math

I Though it is said that onlytwelve
men in the world understand the Ein-

stein", theory, Pitt can boast of at

-least-one in the person of. Dr. J. S.
Taylor, associate professor of mathe-
matics. . ' ‘

Dr. Taylor is conducting a course
on the mathematics of the Einstein

theory. The‘ purpose of the course‘

is’ to bridge the gap between the
mathematical equipment of the gen-
eral physicist, and the special type
of math required for the Einstein

theory, Dr. Taylor~say_s. He believes

that “the Einstein theory makes use
of mathematical theory :Which here-‘
tofore had been of interest only to

.~ mathematicians .speci'alizing inthe

study of ‘partial ‘differential forms.
The layman, and even -the scientist,
.ﬁndsf11pon- attempting to investigate
the Einstein theory that he is..con"-.
siderably‘ at a loss because of. the
lack of -knowledge of this very special
branch of mathematics. , ‘ ~ ~

‘ "‘B_ooks on‘ the Einstein theory-
-‘written; for ‘those without ‘special
very-
-»_largely descriptive, while those giv-
ing a truly adequate presentation of_
v.re1at,ivity are .apt to presuppose so I

mathematical. training are

mruch mathematics as to be beyond
the -comprehension "of most readers.
In this course the attemptis made
to start with only a knowledge of

advanced calculus and differential
equations, and tobuild up from that

point‘ all the mathematics essential

to an. understanding of relativity.

'-The course is being conducted -very
largely as a lecture course, supple-
mented by reading of selected por-
tions from various mathematical
texts. _. . L _

.“The material of the course will

' “later be _oﬂ’ered‘for publication in

bookform, probably after its use an-
other year inmimeograph. It is felt
that such _a book will not only prove.

‘of-interest to physicis_ts,:chemists and-
scientistslin general who desire to

._obtain "a worki‘ng.'-knowledge “of, the

:matics(’ ‘ ‘ -_ .
