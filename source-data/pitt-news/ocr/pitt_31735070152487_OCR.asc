Steve Nicolet, a premed senior majoring

majoring in environmental studies, started f

The Fair Food Cooperative Club earlier this
year. The club supports the Real Food Chal-
l'eng’e, a‘ national organization that strives to
help college students push for healthier and

. greener on—campus dining services.

Starting March 24, several clubs joined
togetherto put on events to table and inform

students of many different aspects of the
food system as part of Real Food Week. The
weeklong series of events are an expansion
of Real Food Day, an event held lastMarch
by the members of the Real Food Challenge.

_  part of one activity, the Food Coop-

erative Club worked with Corey Hawk, the

, head chef at Market Central, to increase the

percentage of real food in Market. Earlier

this week, Hawk made a pledge to provide
more real food offerings at Market Centralin
the future. To show support for the effort on
Monday and Tuesday, each item of real food
at Market Central featured a sign describing
which aspect of it qualiﬁed it to be real food,

whether it be a part of the fair, local, humane '

or ecologically sound categories of real food.

Last Tuesday, an ampliﬁed version of the
symposium held last year on Real Food Day
was held in the Union. This year, the event
included more clubs as well as representatives
from Chipotle, aMexican fastfood chainthat
has multiple restaurants in the Pittsburgh
area. ’

Chipotle is a prime example of a large,
successful restaurant chain that has managed
to maintain the use of real food through its
efforts to only use humanely raised and non-
genetically modiﬁed ingredients, according
to McDonald.

Jon Berger, Pittsburglfs regional Real Food
representative, came to the Union on Wednes-
day to talk to students about the Real Food

Challenge and how to get involved. He held
two workshops, called The Real Food Chal-
lenge: Uniting Students for a Healthy, Just,
Sustainable Food System and Social Justice
in the Food System. V

At these workshops, Berger guided stu-
dents through discussion and activities, forc-
ing them to think about where their foodwas
coming from, how the food system affected

other parts of their life, current problems with _

the food system and what they can do to start
ﬁxing these problems.
Anna Greenberg, afreshman majoring in

' environmental studies, said this week’s events

help promote awareness for a healthier and

more sustainable environment. I
“Real Food Week gives students more op-

portunities because if a student gets really

passionate about an issue, they can become '

involvedinthat aspect right away because the
club is right there in front of them,” Green-

berg, who is also a member of the Fair Food ‘

Corporation Club, said. -

Holly Giovengo, who is also a member of
the club, sees Real Food Week as Fa. “gateway
to awareness.” Giovengo, a junior studying

French and sociology, said thatthis is because .

inspire many of them to get involved.
Students across campus have already

. showedtheirincreasedinvolvementthrough

partnerships with the cooperative by joining
the club’s mission to have 20 percent of Mar-
ket Central’s food be real by the year 2020.

Three environmental student organi-
zations at Pitt — Free the Planet, Students
for Sustainability and Take Back the Tap —
signed an agreement March 19 to help The
Fair Food Cooperative Club spread awareness
about real food and what students» can do to
support the Real Food Challenge. According
to a 2013 report from the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, more than 2 mil-
lion people become ill because of antibiotic-
resistant infections, whichwilllead to 23,000
deaths in the United States.

McDonald said the effort to feature real

food in Market Central will help lower the risk

‘ of these infections and promotea growing

trend to be healthy. . _
To help accomplish her goal, McDonald
brought the Real Food Challenge to Pittlast
October. A ‘
The Real Food Challenge is a national or-
ganization that has been incorporated into
more than 20 universities_ since its creation

. in 2007. As a partof the challenge, students

work to ﬁrst discover how much real food is
already on their campus through an extensive
set of calculations, and then, to increase this
number to at least 20 percent.

. According to Susan Fukushima, resident
district managerfor Sodexo — the company
Pitt uses for its diningiservices —— Sodexo em-
ployees are helping the students by providing
alist of products from Sodexois primary ven-
dors and their primary uses in Market Central.

In order to complete the calculation, the
involved students will put the provided data
into a calculator that puts each individual in-
gredient through a rigorous criteria to deter-
mine whether or not it is considered real food.

“We are currently in the data gathering
stage. Once the data is tabulated to deter-
mine how much real food we currently serve,

- we will be able to set goals to become more
, sustainable and offer more real food,” Fuku-

shima said. ~

Pitt was the ﬁrst school in the Athletic
Coast Conference to join the Real Food Chal
lenge, McDonald said. '

admittance.” Section 4.04 states: “No
admission fee may be charged to gener-
. ate funds for the organization sponsor
or for donations for any purpose.”
Thejudicial Committee stated in the
letter that based on the violations and
“case precedent,” the Caribbean and
Latin American Student Association
must pay back all the funds they were
allocated from the Student Activities
Fund for the Masquerade Ball, a total
of $602.85. ‘ - t
Harun argued that the association
had advertised ticket-sales on banners

hung around campus.and on the group’s .

Facebook page for the Masquerade Ball
the student group hostedjan. 18.
According to Judicial Committee
Chairwoman Audrey Winn, the commit-
tee came to a decision after two hours
of deliberating after the Sunday night
hearing at approximately 5:30 pm. that

evening. Winn said she notiﬁed the Al-

locations Committee and the Caribbean
and Latin American Student Associa-
tion of thejudicial Committee’s decision
on the hearing Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.

Cynthia Thomas, secretary of the

Caribbean and Latin American Student
Association, said the organization will
be more careful with wording to be sure
that she and otherlmembers of the As-
sociation don’t violate the rules in the
Allocations manual. ' ,

‘‘I’in relieved that [the Judicial
Board] understood it was a misunder-
standing,” Thomas- said. “We hope to
next year make sure that there is no
ambiguity.”

In an official letter from thejudicial
Committee addressedlto the Alloca-
tions Committee and the Caribbean and
Latin American Student Association,
the committee members wrote that the
association violated both sections of the
manual because the group had made it
“ambiguous in advertisements that the
event was free to students not choosing
to donate.” a ’

the advertisements did not explicitly
say that the ticket prices were voluntary
donations. , a

Before the event, the Caribbean and
Latin American Student Association ad-
vertised ticket prices to the Masquerade
Ball, its first charity event, on banners
around campus and on the organiza-
‘tion’s Facebook event page.

According to the group’s Facebook
event page, the tickets cost $7 each and
$10 for a ticket and a mask.

Harun said she thought the ruling
was fair.

“The violations seemed pretty clear,
but it’s only fair to see the other side of
the story,” she said.

The committee members wrote in
the letter that they did not believe the
Caribbean and Lat_in'American Student
Association had intentionally tried to
make students pay admission.

“The committee believes they did
so out of lack of knowledge and not out
of dishonesty or malicious intent,” the
Judicial Committee said in the letter.

Winn said the committee members

argued the pros and cons ofboth sides
of the case and decided the verdict.
Then, they decided on a consequence
for the guilty party.

The Judicial Committee said in the
letter that they will work withthe Allo-
cations Committee to review the manual
to ensure that all policies are clear and
make sure student groups understand
the rules to avoid similar situations in
the future.

Harun said she, Student Government
Board President Mike Nites, Board
members Mona Kazour and Abby Zur-
schmit and the Allocations Committee
are currently making changes to the
Allocations Manual to ensure that the
rules of the allocations process are clear
for students.

Thomas said she looks forward to

these changes. -

“It is our responsibility as student
leaders to read and understand the Al-
locations manual,” Thomas said. “The
manual itself should diminish confu-
sion.” I

Columnist

What could be more exemplary of a culture’s
contradictory beliefs than its condemnation
and legal punishment of dog abusers, despite
one of its culinary staples being the meat of
cows that have been held captive, slaughtered,
gutted and ground into hamburger?

Given the fact that there is no biological,
neurological or otherwise scientiﬁc reason for
valuing the life of a dog over a cow, the distinc-
tion between the two can only be reduced to
an arbitrary cultural norm. Legal and public
opinion say that the animals we are most fa-
miliar with — cats, dogs, parrots, goldﬁsh,
certain reptiles — deserve the highest—qual_ity
care and protection.

Meanwhile, pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys
and sheep are perfectly ﬁne to abuse, hold
captive and mass slaughterbecause we like the
way they taste and ﬁnd otherbody parts useﬁil
for clothing, decoration or testing cosmetics.

if

      

of animals extends to every species,   genus

PETA, among other organizations, have
researched and cited scientiﬁc evidence for

-the neurological complexity of non—human

animals, and more still to prove that these

beings (the ones we commonly eat, at least)‘

experience emotions, build relationships,
plan for the future and have a sense of self-
awareness. Why would we use animals for

research if they were so biologically and neu— ‘

rologically different from us?

But despite the remarkable complexity
of non—human animals, all of these facts are
irrelevant to the question of how we should
treat them. If a being is sentient, _and thus,

has the capacity to experience pain, then it,

is ﬁmdamentally wrong to abuse or kill it.
According to a2012 Gallup poll, 94 percent

of Americans consider themselves carnivores

— aﬁgurethathas remained unchanged since
1999. The USDA also recently reported that

in 2013, the average American consumed.

203.2 pounds of poultry and red meat. This
is evidence that most people don’t ﬁnd eating

meat to be morally problematic, while most
would also agree that the abuse of cats and
dogs is abominable.

Buying_loca_lly or “free-range” meats isn’t A
much of a step up either, since the USDA has =
laughable standards with minimal enforce- -

‘ment. Currently, USDAfree-range regulations
apply only to poultry and outline vague re-
quirements that the  has been allowed
outside. There are no stipulations regarding
the quality or size of the outside range, nor the

amount of time the animal remains outside.

As if these rules weren’t lenient enough, the
only evidence the USDA demands in order
for a product to receive the free—range stamp

is “producer testimonials” -— the judicial

equivalent of a pinky promise. Overcrowded
pig pens, stacks of cramped chicken cages
and otherwise abusive environments where
animals never see the outdoors — a more
common practice —— wouldn’t quality as free
range. But allow these animals a few minutes
to walk in the dirt outside of the pen, and

you’ve got the USDA’s stamp of approval.
‘ Free range inthe context of eggs is amean—_

inglessmarketingterrn, since there are no

. oﬂicial USDA_ regulations regarding this

product. The term free range in reference to
livestock is also unregulated.

The term “certiﬁed organic” has the
same pathetic standard for outside access,
and products can still claim thistitle when
participating in the ghastly —-but unfortu-

nately common —— "practices of beak cutting-

and forced molting (shedding ofthe feathers)

. through starvation. Beak cutting, also known

as beak trimmingor debeaking, involves cut-
ting off the beak of poultry with a hot blade,
often without anesthetic. The practice is done
to prevent poultry from injuring or eating one
another, which is all the more likely when
chicken cages are overlapping. -

Putting aside the actual killing for food,
applyingthis treatment to adog ora catwould
undoubtedly be labeled animal abuse under

legal and moral standards.

Do we draw this line because we need
these animals for food? On the contrary, our
food resources would dramatically increase
with a switch to rneat—free diets ~— and the
environment would be much better off for it,
too. According to researchers at Oregon State
University, 70 percent of grain in the United

States is fed to animals that are used forfood. V

An important context for this statistic is the
fact that this grain is grown speciﬁcally to
feed animals in factory farms, which don’t
have access to natural resources themselves.
Cows grazing in pastures would actually be a
much more efﬁcient use of resources, since
they would convert into aconsumer product
indigestible to humans. But most cows bred
for consumption aren’t allowed a natural diet.
Although it’s diﬂicultto precisely measure
something as varied as animal metabolism,
researchers have found that it takes about
seven pounds offeed to produce one pound of

beef. Other types of meat are also ineﬂicient:
more than three pounds of feed produces one
pound of pork and a little under two pounds
of feed creates a pound of chicken.

The only way it could be argued that eat-
ing animals is an efficient use of resources
is by considering the portion of animal feed
that is composed of products humans would
otherwise never eat: diseased animal meat,
feathers, hair, skin, hooves, blood, plastics,
manure, drugs and chemicals. This might
very well be the case, but I’m not so sure this
is a more favorable outcome.

~ . As if this weren’t ineﬂicient enough, data
from the World Bank shows thatthe livestock
industry produces between 18 and 51 percent
of all global greenhouse gas emissions -— not
to mention its contribution to deforestation
and water pollution. -
Isolating all these reasons used to defend
V the consumption of animal products, one
is forced to confront the contradiction that
-comes from abhorring animal abuse as se-
lectively as we do. I

The world of performance is rife with
multitalented ﬁgures who seem to con-
stantly ﬂip back and forth between mul-
tiple_ roles as actor,‘ musician, artist,
writer and back again. .Still, perhaps

no acting troupeemploys the ﬂuidity .

of showmanship quite like the Carnegie
Mellon graduates who make up PigPen
Theatre Co., a seven-piece ensemble
that makes use of everything from
shadow puppets to ﬁlm to indie—folk
in pursuit of compelling storytelling.
For a layman, thisfeclectic mix might
sound a little overwhelming, but to Pig-
Pen Theatre member Arya Shahi — who

spoke to The Pitt News while the” group .
was at South by Southwest earlierthis’ - B

month + it’s this constantblending of
styles that keeps the group engaged;
 “We made a commitment to pursue

.  projects that would keep the seven _

 us ltogetherf’ Shahi said.

 Thegro:up'originally met as 

rriensin-2007. Since then, they’ve gradu-
ated from Carnegie Mellon’s theater

program, relocated to New York City.
and have beenVt'rav’elinglacross the S

country, putting together plays, short

They’re touring not as a theater troupe,

, but as a folk band, playing tracks from‘

their critically acclaimed 2012 release

Bremen and their newest EP “The Way ’

I’m Running-.” The touchingharmonies
onboth releases are often favorably
compared tothe work of indie-folk
icons such as Fleet Foxes not only by
critics, but also by the band itself.

_ The group’s love of folk music has
been integral to its success since the
beginning. “When we all found each

other in college, we just discovered a‘

lot of shared interests,animation being

one, theater being the other, and this»;-

For The Pitt News

In preparation for his upcoming perfor-
mance in the musical “In the Heights,”
senior Mike Magliocca, a theater artsand
ecology and evolution double major at
Pitt, began doing something one might
not expect from most musical theater per-
formers: watching the movie “8 Mile” over
and over again in order to brush up on his
-freestyle rap. .

V _ “In the Heights,” the latest produc-
tion from University of Pittsburgh Stages
in collaboration with the Staycee‘Pearl

Dance Project, premieres March 27 and
runs through April 6 at the Charity Ran-
dall;Theatre: The show, which won the
2008 Tony Award ‘for Best Musical, stars
Magliocca and is, directed by LisaJackson-
Schebetta, an assistant professor in the
theatre department. ‘

The production focuses on Usnavi
(Magliocca), ahyoung Dominican-Ameri-
can and his many friends, and tells of the
struggles they face living in the poor, Latin-
American neighborhood of Washington

‘ Heights in New York City.

Despite ‘the_production’s large cast,

sometimes having as many as “30 sing-

pany, they haven’t lost their desire to

ers, dancers and actors up on the stage” at
one time, Usnavi is a character of special
signiﬁcance, according to Magliocca, as he
also. plays the role of the narrator.

“Oftentimes, audiences aren’t familiar
with Washington Heights, and he is able to
explain and clarify-things,” said Magliocca
of Usnavi.

The show’s music represents the cultural
and ethnic identity of the New York neigh-
borhood that the show is set in.

“The music is a blend of Latin America
and New York, much like Washington

~— Heights is,” Magliocca said. “It’s a mix of
hip-hop, rap and salsa.”

While this mix of genres might seem
unusual for a Broadway musical, the success
of “In the Heights” speaks for itself. After
debuting on Broadway in March 2008, “In
the Heights” received nominations for 13
Tony Awards, winning four and also won
the Grammy for Best Musical Show Album.

The bar is set quite high, to say the least.
However, the cast and crew are not con-
cerned with trying to replicate the success

and grandeur of the original.

“We put pressure on ourselves,”
Magliocca said. “Other universities don’t

Shahi is keeping mum about the proj-

Considering that the group first
turned to using animation and shadow

that’s saying something. ’

Ricardo Vila—Roger, a teaching artist at

along with Usnavi, who owns his own cor-
ner bodega, struggle to make ends meet.
Magliocca said that audience members
can relate to such problems despite the
speciﬁc Latin—American demographic of
Washington Heights.

' “The struggles these characters face are
just very human,” Magliocca said. “Provid—
ing for your family, keeping your business
running, the love of your life ‘not even know-
ing who you are —— they’re very human
issues that everyone can really connect to.”

Vila—Roger pointed to another reason
for the story being so widely celebrated.
“What’s so great is it’s so speciﬁc, it makes
it universal. When people see the story, they
will think, ‘I’ve been through that.’ So our
job is to just play characters as truly as you
can,” he said_. V .

Jackson—Schebetta said that the show’s

" universal nature is because of its timeless

themes. .

“The script is about home and dreams,”
Jackson-Schebetta said. “What it costs to

ticing one on North Negley [Avenue], and
when I tried to show a friend, it wasn’t
there,” Zavala said. _

In order to make the project a reality,
Zavala knew that it needed to start as soon
as possible. I

Zavala met photographer and
Duquesne graduate Kelly Bogel at Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers when she began taking
classes there in 2009, and they agreed to

work on the project together. Bogel’s fa-
miliarity with shooting urban landscapes
and her interest in" the regrowth of natural
life in urban settings over time made her
the perfect photographer for the project.

The project officially started when
Zavala and Bogel received a grant for
the ‘project from The Sprout Fund + a

Pittsburgh agency that aims to support _
innovative ideas in the city. In early 2013,

they located the signs they already knew
about and captured them using a Calumet

Monorail 4—by-5-inch camera. Bogel shot A

on the weekends and explored different
parts of the city, discovering more signs
as she worked.

“I would stand at a sign for agood 10
minutes. I feel like there’s a lot you miss
passing by,” Bogelsaid. “The hardest part

was making sure the camera was perpen- _

dicular to the image. The rest was taking
care of the two exposures to make sure
they were OK.” ’ _ ' _

The 4—by-'5, large-format camera Bo-
gel used allowed her to capture the signs
effectively, even when they were high up

on a building. ,

Sue Abramson, ‘a professor at Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers who assisted Zavala-
and Bogel with theexhibit, said shooting
with a 4-by-5 camera is one of the best
forms of photography. _

“You can tilt and correct all the lines
and make the architecture of the building .
- look appropriate,” Abramson said.

Bogel said he and Zavala scouted sites
for photographs initially, but found more
advertisements while shooting. One sign
always led to another. 6' I

Because of the wide area Bogel scout-

ed, there’s a diverse array of designs fea— '

tured in the exhibit, from the color of the
signs to the actual content they advertise.
“Some of the signs identify the com-

‘ pany, while others are purely advertising,”

Zavala said.‘ “I especially like the signs

2 with images, and there are about a dozen *
_ if of those, but no more.”’

Sometimes only a digital print would
unravel themystery of the remaining pig:
ments. After Bogel caughtthem on ﬁlm,
Zavala would inspect the images digitally
anddecide which ones to print. The ﬁnal
product is a large reproduction of the

advertisement that allows people to View .

the different "aspects of the remaining
design up close.‘ ' _
' ' “The big thing I wanted to accomplish

» V was all the subtle variations in color, form
~ and texture. The things youiwouldn’t be

able toexamine by just passing by,-” Zavala
said. “Our aesthetic was to not manipulate
these. For those, itencourages [viewers]

‘ to look at subtleties.”

_At the beginning of thefproject they
knew of about 10 painted’ advertisements.

By the time they were done shooting, they '

had 180. - -

, “There are a lot. of them in the Strip .-
and Downtown and in places you wouldn_’t
» necessarily think, like Polish Hill,”. Bogel‘

said. “Farther out of the city, they kind
of die out.” n - ‘ ' ,

The signs are found in all Pittsburgh
communities, from Brighton Heights and
Homewood, to McKees Rocks andthe
North Side. Each one of the 150 locations
has a different history..The exhibit is a
detailed illustration that tells’ a story of
Pittsburgh’s past.

“It’s not just an art project. It’s a his~
torical artifact and a really great thing for
the city to have,” Abramson said. I

§_  

Before  at Pitt, the now+19 —year—old

100- and 200-meter breaststroke events
at_ Po1and’s 2012 Summer National Cham-

Shelalso snagged gold medals in the

the Europeanjunior Championships in the  I

100—'méter breaststroke. _ 
 And after the accolades came dozens of

scholarship offers from American unive1:si- .

ties, including Pitt. ,
. “There was quite a bit of competition

to get her at Pitt as opposed to quite afew
. universities,” Knoles said.

Before seriously narrowing down her .
college’ choices, though, Cichowska crossed
"off schools that were in Poland, where her

pti, ns only included a short list of uni-

 

,  and ‘onthe American West Coast,

where the lengthy plane ride from Poland

‘was much too daunting for Cichowska and

her family to imagine. '

100-meter breaststroke, she placed 15th in

_ the ACC witha time of 1:01.61.

Both times, broke Pitt school records.

At the: same event, the combination of
Blair Wegescheide, Veronica Lee, Cichowska
and Dani des Tombe clocked in at 3:39.68 in
the 40o4metermedley relay, which consists’
of four individual legs: backstroke, -breast-
stroke, butterﬂy and freestyle. ‘ ’
Taking hold of the breaststroke, Cichows-

  

ka helped the team break yet another school
record, and des Tombe credited Cie_howska’s
determination for the accomplishment.

I 5‘Kinga is really positive and has a ‘go-get—
it’ attitude,” des Tombe said of her partner,
though _Cichowska’s personal standards for

the word teammate differ from anyone else

on the team. V _

In fact, she’sstill growing accustomed to
the word team. ‘ I

“In the States, they consider swimming a

team sport,” Cichowska said.-“And I’ve never -

done this before. In Poland, they consider

. everything individual, so the person on the

team [here] is very important.”
“Ifeelvery connected with the team, and

' the team keeps me going,” she added. “When

I have a sickness, when I feel bad, when I
have an injury or something, I need to return

I for the team. I thinkthis is why American

 is so strong because you want to

trade individualsport for the team sport.”

“Had it not been for that, my feelings
are that she probably would have made the
NCAA championships this year,” Knoles
said. . .

Cichowska will have three more seasons
to reach suchagoal, but accordingto Knoles,
another goal occupies her expectations.

Knoles says Pitt is just a stepping stone
for Cichowska, who, if she stays healthy and
continues to show improvement on turns,
could represent Poland in future Olympic
games. _ ‘ ‘

He believes she has a “realistic shot” at
making the team. , _,

Cichowska made an effort at the 2012
Olympics in’London, but fell short. She
hopes to qualify for the team in the 2016
Olympics in Rio dejaneiro and achieve what
she calls her biggest dream: swimming for
her country. '

“I’m already in the States, so [think I did
a really good thing with my swimming that
I was able to move tothe States and start at
a really good university,” she said. “This is
a huge advantage that swimming gave me,
and now I think that I can go further and
become an Olympian.”  ~ A —
