see candidates debate for first time

Student radio station WPTS hosts an on—air debate between board’s presidential contenders Justin Romeo and Charlie Shull

Erin Block
Staﬂ” Writer

SGB presidential candidates Jus-
tin Romeo and Charlie Shull met

, formally for the ﬁrst time last

night on a radio show to discuss
their platforms and answer stu-
dent questions.

Members of student news or-
ganizations asked the candidates
questions regarding campus is-
sues.

The candidates were given one
minute to respond to each ques-
tion, as well as a period for rebut-
tal during the debate, which was
held at the WPTS radio station in
the William Pitt Union.

WPTS listeners asked the can-
didates questions through instant
messages and phone calls.

Many of the questions asked

Richard White, surrounded the
interactions between student or-
ganizations and Student Govern-
ment Board.

Nate Hanson, the engineer-
ing director for WPTS, questioned
SGB’s legitimacy as an intermedi-

C ary for students on campus and its

loyalties to the administration.

He asked the candidates if ..
SGB’s only purpose is allocating
funds and why the administration
doesn’t handle it.

Shull said it is impossible for
SGB to be an extension of the ad-
ministration because students
elect the board members. He said
the board functions as an advo-
cate for student groups and that
its purpose is not just to allocate
funds.

- Romeo said it’s a privilege for
the board to allocate funds, and
the responsibility gives SGB le-
gitimacy.

Shull said that as a board mem-
ber, he’s working on organizing

When the program is imple-

“The best way to have trans-
parency is to allow more students
to be involved in Student Govern-

Romeo said the removal of
some committees and budget re-
ductions restricted the amount
of students that could participate
in SGB.

He later said his platform in-
cludes a proposal to create a coun-
cil of presidents from all student
organizations.

He said he wants them to come -

together for a formal setting mul-
tiple times during a semester.
Romeo discussed his role as a
student manager at Sodexo, the
food services company hired by
Pitt. He said his leadership ex-
perience would help him connect

student organizations and SGB.

Shull said that unlike Sodexo,
SGB purely represents the stu-
dents and does not work for the
administration. -

The candidates also discussed
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s fair
share tax.

Romeo said it is important that
students vote in elections and that
theybattle in court to denounce
the tax.

Shull said the government re-
lations committee talks to city
council members to lobby against
the tax. C

“Council members need to
know what our concerns are and
what the tax will do to students,”
he said.

Professor: Shower 21 ‘half—storm’

Meteors best seen from 1 a.m. to sunrise tonight, temperature forecasted to be 45 degrees

Meteors 4 1

moon that was just new yesterday.

Michael Wood—Vasey, an assistant pro-
fessor in Pitt’s astronomy department, said
the meteors come from a particle stream,
which trails behind the 55P/Tempel—Tuttle
comet.

The orbits of the earth and the comet
overlap roughly every November.

“N otin a way that they’ll ever collide,”
Wood—Vasey said, “but merely just that the
debris that gets left behind from the comet
streams across the orbit of the earth.”

The. comet particles ﬂy at an average
speed of 150,000 miles per hour, across
the sky.

When the particles hit the atmosphere,
they compress the air in front of them to
very high temperatures, breaking apart
in their ﬁery trajectory and leaving the
glowing ﬂares and streaks of a meteor
shower.

The meteors, all coming from one
stream, appear to originate from one point
in the sky, called the radiant.

In this case, that point is in the middle
of the “lion” constellation, Leo, which is
why astronomers call these meteors Le-
onids.

Leo rises above the northeastern hori—.

zon between 1 and 3 a.m.

It takes 1,000 visible meteors per hour '

to constitute a meteor storm. Depending
on the year, these Leonids range from mod-
est to spectacular.

Wood~Vasey recalled the storms from

1998 and 2001, during which the number of

meteors per hour reached up to 3,000.
At an estimated 500 visible meteors per
hour, this year’s Leonids will constitutea
half-storm —— still a strong display.
Wood—Vasey said Pitt’s observatory will
not do anything particularly special con-
cerning this well-known meteor stream.
“One of the interesting things about me-
teors is they really don’t need a telescope
and don’t even need binoculars just to enjoy
them,” he said. “You just want to be able to
see the entire sky, and the human eye is a
very good instrument for doing that.”
The highest‘ number of meteors was
visible around 4:45 p.m. yesterday, mean-
ing the Leonids’ peak hour was effectively

~ invisible for onlookers in North America

and Europe. .
Observers in Asia had the equivalent of

during predawn hours there.

Wood—Vasey still recommends Pitt stu-
dents venture out to catch a glimpse of the
half-storm.

“It’s just always hard to predict exactly
what part of the stream is going to be out
there because we don’t have all these mul-
tiple dust particles mapped out,” he said.
“It’s almost just when we pass through them
that we really have a sense of what their

He said students should look for a place
with a good amount of open sky —— and that
having a blanket on which to lie down and a
bit of patience can make the difference.

Bring something warm, as temperatures
are forecasted to be around 45 degrees
early Wednesday morning.

Just remember not to call the meteors
“meteorites” — unless they hit the earth.

Video games to
fight obesity

hile the Senate debates
whether to include a public
option or abortion cover-

age in its health care bill, it’s missing
a crucial component of American
health: video games.

At a meeting for the American
Heart Association, researchers said
playing the Nintendo Wii constitutes
actual exercise. ‘ .

Before you try to count the next
“Legend of Zelda” gameasagymcred-
it, hold on to your pointed green caps.

The studytargeted games that emulate
sports and ﬁtness regimens — a far
cryfrom prowling Hyrule.

The study, which Nintendo spon-
sored, said one-third of the mini-
games-in “Wii Sports” and “Wii Fit”
meet or exceed the AHA threshold
of moderate exercise, according to
Reuters.

Admittedly, the st11dy’s Nintendo‘

sponsorship calls its objectivity into
question, but gaming has many ap-
parentbeneﬁts, especiallywhen com-
bined with exercise.

Healthy habits are the most effec-
tive and cost—efﬁcientway to avoid de-
bilitating illnesses like diabetes, heart
disease and morbid. obesity.

Regular exercise also reduces At-
tention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disor-
der — something that affects young
people as much as, if not more than,
the release date for “God of War 3.”

When gaming promotes exercise,
players can get these health beneﬁts
in enjoyable doses.

Physically, observe the fervent
players of “Dance Dance Revolution”
in the lower level of the William Pitt
Union. They bring ﬂuids to replenish
electrolytes lost from sweating more
than if they boxed a 10-round bout
with Floyd Mayweather.

But those who play “Mike 'I‘yson’s
Prmch Out” could end up lool<inglike
Kingl-Iippo. The story ofTanya]essen
spread on the Internet when she said
“DDR” helped her lose 95 pounds.

Educational video games, such as
“Brain Age” or teaching games, also

provide an entertaining way for kids ‘

to exercise their cognitive skills.
We’ve already learned many life

skills from video games: “The Oregon

Trail” taught us to stock up on axles,

“Earthbound” taught us how to use
an ATM and “Duck Hunt” taught us
to hate dogs.

Beyond that, though, video games
teach children how to read better, type
faster and enjoy math.

Some Pittsburghvideo game com-
panies, like Etcetera Edutainment,
have already started creating rnate—
rial forthis niche market.

“Wii Fit” does not substitute tra-
ditional exercise, just as “Geometry

Wars” certainly cannot replace Math _
0220. But it is better than the seden- ’

tary pixilated alternative oflVlIVlORPGs
or ﬁrst-person shooters.

Americans are obese. Anyﬁrnway
to curb that problem is welcomed.

libraries have even started joining
the video game community. -

Last Saturday was National Gam-
ing Day at libraries across the United
States. It encourages people to come
out and use libraries as asocial gather-
ing place.

While the struggling Carnegie Li-
brary system did not participate, it
does offervideo game nights for teens
on Thursdays and Fridays.

Students sit in class all day with
the exception of recess or scattered
gym classes that vary depending on
schools and state laws. Then, when
they get home, many kids plop down
and time outto a long, isolated session
of passive gaming.

Changing the game is easier than
changing the behavior, so healthier
gaming options can ease modern pa-
rental challenges.

IfPitt students really need avideo
game ﬁx for exercise, bicycles at the
Petersen Events Center offer a biking
simulation game to make the miles
pass a little faster.

Wri isn’tamagic solutionfor every
layabout. It’s just an entertaining way
to encourage a little more exercise
than kids ——— or college students —
normally get. Dietis stillamajorfactor
in health and well—being.

Students looking to avoid the
freshman 15 -— or 50, really — can-
notsirnplyplayahardcorewii session
inlieu of regular exercise. . ,

In the end, all players still need
some sunlight -— at least until the
release of “Wii Tanning.”

Tuesdayswith Molly

Palin, Cheney or Sanford?

Molly chooses three fantasy contenders to replace Lou Dobbs’ CNN show

Molly Green
Columnist

 

CNN’s reigning conservative pun-
dit, Lou Dobbs, resigned from the
network last Wednesday, leaving
a gaping red hole and a lacklus-
ter john “Magic Wall” King in his
place.

Yes, it’s true. King, a so—called -

moderate and longtime Associ-
ated Press reporter, will ﬁll Dobbs’
old time slot, where he intends to
bring objectivity to punditry.

“I don’t think you have to give
up your objectivity and give up be-
ing a reporter to be part of a very
lively, provocative, feisty conversa-
tion about the issues of the day, as
long as it is built around facts and
information,” King said in an in-
terview Thursday. “I think people
are hungry for it. If I’m wrong, I’m
wrong.”

Well, clearly, old-timer King is
a bit out of touch with how things
work in the pundit world. This isn’t
some magic wall you can touch and
bend at your leisure, King. There
are rules, df"mn it. _

You see, unlike MSNBC, CNN
likes to pretend it’s an objective
and moderate news channel, and
therefore it is essential that the
station have at least one conserva-
tive talk show.

This way, Wolf Blitzer can con-
tinue to roll his eyes more than
Rollie Pollie Ollie on a greased
dance ﬂoor, while CNN maintains
its objective facade —— hence why
it gave Dobbs a show in the ﬁrst
place.

Therefore, now that old Palpa- .

tine Dobbs has officially left the
station, CNN will no doubt sweat

blue until it can quickly replace ‘

Dobbs’ show with that of another
conservative pundit.

But CNN must be careful in its
decision, because with each pos-
sible pundit, you get something
different, something special.

After all, I’ll bet you’ve never
seen Sean Hannity dress up as
Thomas Paine and liken President

Barack Obama’s presidency to the

rule of George III.

But I’ve seen Glenn Beck do that
plenty of times.

Thus, l’ve outlined three per-
sonal fantasy contenders forthe
show, as well as what we could
expect from each.

“Softball with Sarah Palin”

Fresh off her recent book tour

for her memoir, “Going Rogue,”

(now selling for just $9 at Ama-
zon.com!), Palin hopes to touch
on similar themes of politics, faith,

family and that good-for-nothing.

David Letterman on her hour-long
show.

According to Palin, “Softball”
is the female yin to Hannity/Beck/
O’Reilly’s yang, as demonstrated
by the show’s clever original slogan

“The Reinterpretation Room
with Dick Cheney” .

Staged under a dimly lit set
ﬂanked by gargoyles, Cheney will
ﬁnally reveal to the world his po-
litical vision.

Like Sauron of Mordor, Cheney’s'
squinty weasel eyes see all, and af-
ter years of agonizing waiting, it is

, time for us to ﬁnally learn “what’s

‘ really going on.” '

' With his extensive experience
as an ex—vice president and friend-
shooter, he has seen things we’Ve
only experienced in our night-
mares.

Now he’s here to share with us
what torture really is, ladies and
gentlemen. ‘

The exalted one will receive no
guests on his show, as it is ﬁlmed

 

Clearly,,old-timer King is a bit out of touch
with how things work in the pundit world.

— “Girl power!”

“It is in no way an allusion to
Chris Matthews’ show,” she said,
when asked to explain why she se-
lected her shovv’s title. “Girls play
softball!”

Each episode will begin with the

. opening credits of “Top Gun,” end-

ing with a portrait ofPa1in in front
of the American ﬂag while holding
her favorite shotgun in her favorite
red powersuit, naturally. ‘

The ﬁrst half of Palin’s show
wouldconsist largely of irrelevant
fragmented similes to bass ﬁshing,
while Palin updates her Twitter
live.

The second half of the show will
highlight guests — all friends and
ideological comrades of Palin, of
course. I

in a remote secret location, though
Don LaFontaine will do most of the
voice—overs. .

I would write more on this
topic, but the details of this show

' are murky at best.

Moreover, Cheney feeds on
dark energy, so I don’t dare to
speak his name more than three
times, lestI summon his presence
like Bloody Mary. A

“Love and Politics with Mark
Sanfor ”

Gov. Mark Sanford was a natu-
ral contender for the show. He’s a
Southern conservative, and he’ll
likely have to look for a new job
soon, as his probable impeach-
ment looms ever closer.

S

Ravenstahl’s proposed tax ‘kind of bullcrap ’

 
  
 

Shane Levy
Columnist

After the polls in Pittsburgh closed
and Luke Ravenstahl was re-elected
as mayor, Ravenstahl announced
his intentions to propose a 1 per-

_ cent college-education privilege

tax on college students’ tuitions
to alleviate ﬁnancial struggles with
, the city’s pension ﬁmd.

In 2009, the equal opportunity
to higher learning by all Ameri-
cans is at a critical juncture, and
Ravenstahl’s proposal for a high-
er-education tax increases the
already devastating college fees
and undercuts the general trend
of exorbitant college costs.

Tuition and other college—re—
lated costs have consistently in-
creased for 30 years.

Over the past ﬁve years, col-
lege costs have grown nearly 40
percent, with the tuition and fees
of four-year public universities
increasing 6.5 percent in 2008
alone.

Tuition and fees have increased

in other private and two-year edu-
cational institutions, as well.

In 1979, the average tuition at

a private four-year university cost

—approximately $9,000 to $10,000,

adjusted to inﬂation. It is now

roughly $26,000. Public two- and

four-yeari_nstitutions have seen
their tuitions virtually double in
that same timespan.

Currently, 60 percent of all col-
lege graduates leave college with
debt that is on average more than
$19,000.

Between 2001 and 2010, 2
million academically qualiﬁed
students will not be able to at-
tend college because they cannot
afford it. ' -

The current trend in rising tu-
ition costs threatens to inhibit the
potential of so many prospective
students throughout the United
States.

The 1 percent college-education
privilege tax that Ravenstahl has
proposed would require out-of-
state Pitt students to pay an ad-
ditional $230, with in-state Pitt
students paying a $133 tax, accord-
ing to average tuition rates.

Though Ravenstahl’s efforts
might seem insigniﬁcant in the
grand scheme of those frightening
statistics, the college-education
privilege tax demonstrates our in-
ability to protect a fundamental
human right: having equal access
to higher education.

In a Post-Gazette article, Pitt
student Josh Smith responded to
the proposed tax by saying, 7‘It’s
kind of bullcrap.”

‘ many have to take jobs, as well.

Ravenstahl’s proposal to tax
college tuition adds even more
ﬁnancial pressure to students al-
ready struggling to manage the

. outrageous price of college tuition

and life.‘ I

About 2,500 years after Plato
proclaimed education as the fun-
damental scheme to creating an
ideal society in his republic -

_ and some 60 years after world-

4;

Ravenstahl’s intent to tax Pittsburgh’s
university students disregards efforts to
make higher education ‘more affordable.

As a fellow Pitt student, I must
agree.

Countless students are forced
to acquire unprecedented levels of
debt to pay for college tuition, and

leading countries, including the
United States, declared education
a fundamental human right in the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights — the current state of af-

fairs in the American education
system struggles to uphold those
principles.

Throughout the United States,
countless people from inner—city
neighborhoods and impoverished

communities have already been .

denied the opportunity for higher
learning.

If the United States must be-
come a better, stronger, smarter
nation — a nation capable of tak-
ing the global community into the
21st century — then it needs to al-
low those people to obtain a degree
and thwart efforts to increase the
cost of education.

Ravenstahl’s intent to tax
Pittsburgh’s university students
disregards efforts to make higher
education more affordable.

He compromises not just the
prospect of luring future students

1 into a city that is increasingly rec-

ognized as a college town, but per-
haps more signiﬁcantly, he com-
promises the integrity of equal

access to education.

CNN would probably consider

be renamed “Love and Politics with

weekly poetry readings, insight
from frequent guest co—hostJohn
Edwards and, of course, advice to
call—in listeners.

“Hello, you’ve reached ‘Love

Just call me Mark.”

“Hi, my name’s Hil — er, Helga,
and I need some advice.”

“What’s your problem,’ Hel-

“Well, I have this friend, see,
and she’s worried that her husband
might be cheating on her again.
Everyone thinks he’s so great, but
I know he can never leave me, be-
cause he’d be nothing — nothing

“Well, then, maybe you should
i leave him. Once a cheater, always a

cheater,” chimes in Edwards.

“But you don’t understand;
I love him. People think I’m just

“Whatwe’re playingwithisthe idea

because it’s an audience vote,” My-
ers said. “That’s why we have a rule
about no original or opera music.
People want something they can
recognize.”

Campus Superstar began in
Pittsburgh in 2007.

“We have abuilding to support,
and we always do afundraiser,” My-
ers said. “We didn’t want to have
a lecture. We didn’t want to do
something obligatory. We wanted
to do something fun — and this is.
The focus is on the students and
showing that we’re here for them.
They have the opportunity to be
creative.” A

One such creative student, Pitt
freshman Trey Draude, performed
The Beatles’ “With A Little Help

‘ From My Friends.”

He said other than warming up,
he did little to prepare and that his
decision to try out was mostly made
on a whim.

“I’m a novice, though I was Cap-
tain Hook in a high school musical,’-’
he said.

Draude said he loves singing, .

despite the nerves that come with
performing on stage.

“I just keep telling myself I’m do-
ing this for fun,” he said. “If you’re
not having fun, then why do it?”

Nick Jovonovich, a freshman
at Duquesne, sang josh Groban’s
“You’re Still You.”

A member of the Duquesne Uni-
versity Tamburitzans, an Eastern
European folk music ensemble,
Jovonovich is no stranger to the
stage.

“I don’t really get nervous since

I’ve been performing for 15 years.
I’m doing this to get some recog-
nition,” he said. “I have bets with
friends about it. They want me to
try out for ‘American Idol’ after
graduation.”

Pitt sophomore Larissa Briley
performed Ella Fitzgerald’s “Some-
one To Watch Over Me” because “it
was an easy song to sing a cappella
and I really love it.

“I’m always a little nervous,” she
said, “but this is structured well.
It’s really laid—back. I’m listening
to classical music and just trying
not to freak out.”

As president of the Musical The-

ater Club, Briley oversees an up-

coming variety show and organizes
lectures for club members.

She said Campus Superstar gives
her the opportunity to take cen-
ter stage, but Briley doesn’t limit
herself. if

“I just auditioned for an op-
portunity to sing. I guess I’ll get
through life if I’m not the Campus
Superstar,” Briley said with a hint
of sarcasm.

Monica Ziemski, a sophomore at
Duquesne, performed Taylor Swift’s
“White Horse.”

Ziemski said she adopted coun-
try twang when she performed.

“I don’t even know where it
came from. I’m from Pittsburgh.
It’s a really emotional song, and I
can sing it well because, like a lot
of girls, I personally can relate to
it,” she said.

Her heart is in the right place.
She said she wants “to win Campus

The incidents that shape the plot
are not accidents but rather, daily
occurrences that range from waiting
for the bus to being asked for spare

The dance-theater production plays
with the effects of chance occurrences,
as well as memory.

The second act largely responds
to the ﬁrst, drawing upon and play-
ingwith the audience’s memories and

recollections of act one.

“As the show progresses, mate-

Dell keeps its smartphone abroad for now

Dell will not introduce new smartphone to the United States until it’s ready to compete with the 3G—infused U. 8. market

Donald Campbell
Columnist

 

A few days ago, Dell announced the
limited release of its new venture
into the smartphone arena.

Well, it’s limited in that it won’t
be available to Americans. ‘

Dell will release the smartphone,
dubbed the Dell Mini 3, only to China
and Brazil.

But don’t worry. We’re not miss-
ing anything too exciting.

The Mini 3 cleverly lets Dell
continue the naming convention it
adopted when it came out with its
netbook offerings, the Dell Mini 9
and Dell Mini 10.

The little smartphone, which runs

the Google Android open—source.

smartphone operatingsystem, ap-
pears rather underwhelming. ‘
Underwhelming at least by iP—
hone and “the Perfect Storm” stan-
dards. V
The Mini 3 seems unexciting be-

cause of some confusion about its

speciﬁcations.

At ﬁrst, according to an article in
PCWorld, Dell said the phonewould
only be 2G compliant — vs. the new
iPhone 3G — and would not support

Wi-Fi connectivity for quick Internet
access when in Wi-Fi hotspots.
Compared with the iPhone, a Dell
Mini 3 without these features would
not compete successfully.
The Mini 3 comes complete with

a 3.5-inch touch screen and a 3.2-

megapixel camera.
The touch screen matches that of
the iPhone and the camera boasts a

. whopping 0.2 megapixel improve-

ment over the iPhone, but the in-

A ternal speciﬁcations of speed and

performance pale in comparison

to the Mini 3’s rivals. The Mini 3.

appeared to have “lame” speciﬁca-
tions, according to PCWorld.

So here is a dilemma.

Let’s imagine a hypothetical situ-
ation» that involves Dell bringing the
Mini 3 to the United States.

We must note that Computer-
World and PCWorld both feel un-
sure whether Dell will bring the new
smartphone to the United States.

If Dell decides to make this move,
it can go one of two ways, as the spec-
iﬁcations could cause the phone to
fail immediately in the American
market.

But those same speciﬁcations
could come with a low price tag,
and could thus ﬁnd a niche in the

discounted market.

People might buy the phone and
deal with reduced performance for a
quid pro quo reduction in cost.

So what is Dell likely to do?

For the moment, Dell will more
than likely feel content with market-
ing to China and Brazil exclusively.

' The smartphone markets inthose
two countries are not nearly as ﬁerce
as the market in the United States,
where more people covet smart-
phones and more companies have
the infrastructure support and mar-

the Mini 3 a great deal of develop-
ment attention. '

According to PCWorld, China
Mobile might already require the
Mini 3 to gain 3G support if it has
not already adopted it.

If Dell comes to the United States
soon, it would do well to sell the
phone at a good discount over its
competitors, as it appears to require
a great deal of research and devel-
opment before it can successfully
trounce the iPhone.

viability of the Android operating
system, and will thus make it more
available for other manufacturers to
develop smartphones that can run
it effectively. "

The more models of phones
become available for Android, the
more Android’s market share will
likely increase.

The announcement of the Dell
Mini 3 can only bring additional
competition to the worldwide mar-
ket, and it might begin to make the

Dell would need to work hard in
the United States and immediately
compete with the entrenched smart-
phone products. ‘

The cell phone company under

lease the Mini 3 will be able to give

But the phone’s existence does
affect its operating system.
Computerworld published an ar-
ticle describing the phone as a “small
victory” forthe Google Android op-
erating system, even if it doesn’t get
marketed to Americans directly.
The phone’s existence proves the

other manufacturers somewhat
nervous.

The Mini 3 itself might not have
the speciﬁcations to affect the
smartphones already available to
American consumers, but because

a different stylistic theme, which gets

wider range of styles,” Eggar said. “It’s
aprettyrockingshow—- lot of intense
and exciting groove.-based music and
cool things with live sampling.”

In act two, the audience and per-
formers switch roles — spatially,

anyway. _

Theatergoers won’t have to get up '

anddance, but after intermission, they
will ﬁnd themselves sitting where the
stage previously existed, as dancers

cavort through where the seats used

to exist.
Kope saidthis shift explores the ex-
perience ofbeingan audience member
‘versus beingthe performer. .
The show also reﬂects the compa-

‘ ny’s transition to its new home, hence

the incorporation of the location int
the performances title. . T

“We’re using live music, dance and
ﬁghting to create an event that is in
some ways our response to being in
the Strip [Dist:rict]” Kope said. ‘The
Strip isthe kind ofplace that allows for
alot of imagining.” j '

The production explores the idea
that “everybody uses the Strip as a

who live there and people who go to
~ work there every day,” Kope said. “A

window‘ pulls back across from a bar
patio where you’re having a beer, and
it’s somebody’s gorgeous apartment.
It’s so cool. 1

“There’s that saying about every- ~

one being connected by six degrees

The theater companyrealizedhow
desperately it needed a permanent

After that, they decided to settle _

down.
Kope said that to some extent, the
mobility of the performance ‘made it

_ somewhat beneﬁcial.

“Movingaround isn’tthat'awful for
us. It’s very reenergizing. When you’re
comfortable someplace, it’s time to
move on,” he said. ' '

’ Eggar discussed the ways inwhich
the production integrates the aspects of
music and dancetocrafcacommentmy
on the performances themes.

“There’s a lot of interesting com-
mentary. For example, with the music,
all of act one is ampliﬁed and beauti-
fully scored. Inacttwo, [the musicians
play] on the stagewith instruments and
found objects,” he said. *

Eggar said he hopes “Incident[s]
in the Strip” will pleasantly surprise
the audience.

‘‘There’s a very fun ﬂavor. It’s kind
of hard to explain, but there are some
very cool surprises,” he said.

At least 2,100 middle school stu-

basketball team when it takes on
North Florida in its season opener
Tuesday. Tipoff for the game is set
for 11 a.m.

Students and teachers from 10-

to campus to spend the day in the
Petersen Events Center for a school
day promotional event. .

“I think it’s going to be a fabu-
lous day,” Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato said. “It’s an opportunity
for them to come to a college cam-
pus on aﬁeld trip. There are differ-

In their exhibition game, the
Panthers defeated Seton Hill 91-60.
Since then, Berenato said, the team
has started focusing on intensity
and defense presence in practice.

The players will work on fur-
ther improving these skills against
a veteran North Florida team,
which returns three starters and
eight players. .

“They have a game under their
belt, unlike us,” Berenato said.
“They are very skilled and disci-
plined. It will beta challenge for us,
and we’re excited to see where we
fare with them.”

The Ospreys fell to No.15 Flor-
ida State 79-50 in their ﬁrst game
this season.

Sophomore guard Brittany
Kirkland led North Florida with
12 points, while freshman Dori
Lansbach contributed 11.

ence last season.

For the Panthers, the opening
game marks the return of junior
point guard Jania Sims. Sims suf-
fered a season-ending injury in the
Panthers’ ﬁrst game last year.

Berenato said the team feels ex-
citedto have Sims back on the ﬂoor
because she acts as a ﬂoor leader
and a coach on the court for the
Panthers. . .

“She knows every single play-
er’s position on the court and ev-
ery single play,” Berenato said. “If
somebody forgets, she gives direc-
tions. We really haven’t had a point
guard since she went out a year and
a half ago.”

Sims scored 14 points and
dished out eight assists in Pitt’s
scrimmage against Seton Hill.
Junior Shayla Scott led all scorers
with 20 points and grabbed eight
rebounds.

The Panthers started Sims and

before Pitt’s Elite Eight barmer glided
towardthe rafters. . -

People assumed the banner getting
raised signiﬁed Pitfsﬁnalmoments of
reminiscence before the new season’s
St:-111:.

But after a ﬁrst halfduring which
Wofford out-rebounded Pitt 19-12 and
shot45.5 percentfrorntheﬁeldtotake
a 31-24 lead, it became clear this team
needed more time to play together.

“We couldn’t have drawn it up any
better.Thiswasthe exacttype ofgame
we needed from our ﬁrst game,” Pin;
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “Our
players had to do things they’ve never
done before, and they got it and made
plays.”

Those players didn’t answer many
of the questions surroundingPittenter-
ingthe year.

Without Blair, who will rebound?

Minus Fields, whoisPitt’s point guard?
WithoutYoung’s 19.2 points per game,
who will lead Pitt inscoring?

The Panthers won’t rebound the
same without Blair:

McGhee had a game-high eight
rebounds for the team.

“We’ve got to get our rebounding
ﬁgured out. We’re not doing a good

enough job,” Dixon said. “We knew .

that going in, and we’re goingto get it
addressed.”

The Panthers also need help at the _

point.

the team’s scorers.

As for scorers, a few emerged Fri-
day nighttoreplaceYoung’s consistent
outputlastyear:

Wanamaker probably had the
best seven-minute stretch in recent
memory, starting in the game’s 
11 

During that stretch, Wanamaker
made great plays drivingto the basket
and converting shots. He scored 10 of
his points duringthattime and played
solid defense to help shut down Wofi
fordasthe game continued. 5

Freshman’ Dante Taylorshowed he
can score, as well. He put up 13 points
in19 minutes. .

The problem is, the team’s post de-
fense suffers when he’s in the game.

ment.

“Wehadanewteam, mostofusbe-

maker said. “Everybody gets nervous
before a big game. This was my ﬁrst

start. Nerves are goingto come.” *‘

Luckily for Pitt fans, the horn blew,
signaling the end of Pitt’s escape from
itsﬁrst game. The roof almost blew off
with the collective sigh of relief in the
Petersen Events Center.
