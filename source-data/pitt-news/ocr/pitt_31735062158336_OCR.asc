The Interfraternity Judicial

Commission last week took
action against the pledges of
Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity, for
A their abduction of Gary Stein,
Arts ’60, a Phi Epactive.
The. action arbse from a com-4
gplaint submitted to the commis-
sion by Ray King, fraternity ad-
viser. King listed two reasons for
his complaint. The primary _I‘_€aS0n
was that the prank brought much

 bad publicity to the fraternity sys-
tem. Secondly, a man was kept Out
of school an entire day‘ without
his consent.

The ﬁve-man commission head-
ed by Chuck Wittlan, Arts ’59,
held a hearing with Dave Mala-‘
koff, vice president of the active
chapter and ‘ Harold Seder, Arts
'62, treasurer of the pledge group.

The penalty levied was one
recommended by the Pittsburgh
police department. Each of the
24 pledges was ﬁned $2. ‘The
$48 will be turned over-‘to the

’ Press Old Newsboy Fund.

 The victim of the‘ kidnapping,

-Gary Stein commented, “The only

lasting damage that is regrettable“

is that the reputation of social fljitf
ternitics “has” suffered.”

and principals of s e c o n d a r y
schools in this area at a dinner in
the’ Student Union last week.

, A The Chancellor discussed ‘with
the group the Pitt developments
in which they, assecondary school
representatives, were most inter-
ested. / ‘ ‘

These- included the ‘trimester

 plan, which will go into effect for

freshmen and sophomores in Sep'-
tember, 1959; a special grants—in—

 aid program for incoming fresh-

men from the local area; and par-
ticipation of the University in the
loan program of the National De-
fense Education Act.

‘Freshman Aid Provided

He also discussed the progress
made by the UniVersity’s regional
commission «in ‘developing closer
working relationships between
elementary and secondary schools,
colleges, and graduate and pro-
fessional schools.

The special grants-in-aid pro-

gram for incoming local fresh-
men, to go into eﬁect at the
. beginning of the ﬁrst trimester
term, provides modest scholar-
ship’ stipends to freshmen of
good academic promise who are
in need of such help.

The Chancellor emphasized the
fact that‘ the special grants pro-
gram is supplemental to the Uni-
versity’s existing scholarship and
loan program.

, No Cost Increase

The total cost of a student’s ed-
ucation under the trimester cal-
endar will be' no more than under
the traditio/nal semester calendar,
but that cost will be incurred over
a shorter period of time.

"Students may meet this cost

in various ways. The Univer-
sity hopes to make ‘increased
scholarship and loan funds
available, and will encourage

The Rev. James H. Robinson,
pastor of the Church of the Mas-

speaker for Heinz Chapel service
this week. .

Recently returned from Africa,
he will-speak" on “Africa and the
West” tomorrow, from 12:10-12:35
p.m. He will lead a discussion on
the same topic in the _afternoon
from 3:00-4:15 p.m. in the lounge
of the SU.

_ Dr.- Robinson has written an
autobiography e n ti t I e d 1 “Road

ten a book “Tomorrow is Today.”

“There will be no change intuition rates at the Univer-

velopment program is not to parrot the Ivy League.” “The
University is primarily a commuter school and always will
be. We like to have it this way.”

It will encourage students to

invest in their career by borrow-.

ing the cost of education and re-
paying the loan after graduation.
Communters’ Main Interest

The student who ﬁnds it abso-
lutely necessary to work to finance

his education may elect to skip __

any one of the three trimesters
to seek employment’. This ﬂexible

schedule will permit students to

work during periods when there
might be less competition with
other college students for job op-
portunities.

The Chancellor revealed that
the University is interested in

largest and primary is the local
or commuter student. The re-
maining classiﬁcations are re-
gional, national, and interna-
tionzotl.

The latter two are necessary for
the better education of the local
and regional student, as they pro-
vide breadth of View and an ex-
change of concepts, better place-
-ment possibilities, and broaden
the area of ﬁnancial support.

“ Eight Improvements Cited

“The burden of" our interest is
upon local and regional students,
upon local and regional students,"
he added. “The University vis-
of our community.” --

Inhis speech the Chancellor
listed eight basic improvements
the University ‘has attempted.
First on his list was the attempt
to improve the quality of teach-
ing. Sabbatical leaves, reduc-
tion of teaching loads and the
number of part-time instructors.
and increases in salaries are de-
signed to achieve this end.

The Chancellor looks forward
to the improvement of our library
facilities. Forbes Field, which the

- University recently acquired, will

be the site of the new library
building.
' More Facilities Available‘
The‘ Counseling Service and the
Student Union has improved the
approach to the “whole student."
Another goal is the lightening of
students’ ﬁnancial responsibilities.

   ~Pirice Is High  

The long-awaited new University Bookstore Wi1lPT0b'
ably open soon, but without any change in price policy.
Prices on books at the University Bookstore of'the

present are as high as at any retail bookstore. The self-

service esthetic aspects of the new bookstore will not ‘offset

,the basic matter of the pocket book, so important to priC.e-

conscious students. ‘

The mark—ups on books are high enough that a book-
store may be self-supporting with a discount such as Car-
negie‘ Tech’s_ten per cent off list price plan.

The used-book system is far from desirable ‘from the-

‘ standpoint of the student. .

-Books are bought back at- ridiculously low prices and
sold tdother students at prices often approaching the orig-
inal selling”price. “ ’ --

Why not institute used book sales as Penn State and "
several other large schools do with the student who wishes

to sell a book dealing more directly with the student buyer?

The seller would place his bookin a designated section
of the bookstore with a slip noting the desired selling price.
When the book is sold, the seller receives the money. minus
a nominal ten per cent service charge. - ’ . _ ‘

Other‘co-operative-type plans would be equally good
in formation of new bookstore policy. .— 4 i

Several weeks ago, the advanc-

“S ed placements test ofthe College

Entrance Examination Board’
was mentionedgin The'Pitt News.
This is an examination through
which compe-
tent high school 
seniors can be-
gin college as '
sophomores, or
at least, (with
several, sopho-
more courses.

ity of Pitts-

achieve the required level for
sophomore placement here.‘

written,‘ his ‘examination grade,
the examination questions, and
an interpretation of, the grades.

The high school or prep school
also gains valuable information,
for in the fall the College Board
arranges to have sent to each
school the exam books of its stu-
dents, exam questions, and a re-
p_o1_‘t of the colleges’ actions on
the placement.

Students Stand Out

The experience of administra-
tors of the exam has been most
informative. They ﬁnd that stu-
dents in college beneﬁted ap-

_preciably from their advanced

school courses and made good
showings scholastically. ’

Those who took sophomore
courses as freshmen made good
grades in them, almost without
exception. This is really. to be
expected because of the high
level of attainment necessary for
advanced placement.

The students ranked relatively
high in their classes at the end

of the freshman year. Very few ’

of these students planned to
ﬁnish in less’ than four years, al-‘_
though it would have been easy
forthem to do so, even if they
had only advanced in one or two
courses. This should have proved

. a ‘revelation to trimester plan-

ners. .
Some pre-m-edicaland prc-en-
gineers were able to include in
their programs subjects they
could not otherwise have taken.

If this University begins to
draw students of the highest
caliber, we too can share in the

advantages of this plan which

eliminates needless duplication

‘and increases opportunity for ad-

vanced work in college. _

Editor, The Pitt News:
While I would not deny your
right to express your opinion on

political matters and figures,‘ ’I.
feel that you have. gone over-,

board on the man you have
dubbed “Tricky Dicky.”

For "instance, in your column,
“Opportunist at Work,” using
Democratic magazines such as
Nation, you charged Mr. Nixon
as being an opportunist. Immedi-
ately. prior to this, you admitted
to his being a politician: Can Mr.
Nixon, as a politician, be any-

T‘ thing but an opportunist?

You stated that “he said that
the American people ought to
be better informed on foreign"
policy. Then you continue'that
he was wrong in saying that the
. American people were not well-
informed enough to be granted
great consideration in the course
of settling
crisis. ’ c

while the second statement re-

in which the American people
are very poorly informed in
these matters.

But the most galling part 01
your column is that in- which you
attack Mr. Nixon for desiring to
be ‘President. I shouldthink that
the Presidency ‘is a most worthy
goal.‘Therefore to conduct one’s
career with such a goalin mind
is hardly evil. Nor is speaking

No Block P Color Shots
Editor, The Pitt News:

At the-Penn State game, the
Owl photo staﬂf had planned to
take several color shots of stunts
performed for the "'59 edition.

, Much _to our consternation, we
1ound"with all the photographic
equipment set up, we could not
snap the shots. The leaders of
the Block put up a great effort,
but certain insurgent elements
Plfevehted any proper stunt for-
mation. V

Finally, Block P executive had
to call ‘off the stunt performance
before’ all the planned "stunts
were completed.

ltlis true that the fact that we
could not take the pictures we
required made the situation more
graphic to us, but the picture 01
the Pitt. student, or certain
members of the student body, it
presented_ was far from pleasant.

  “ Did your polio shot
hurt, Jackie?”

\What is pain? is it the quick prick of aneedle . . . or the slow ‘

breaking of a heart?

If ‘you’ve everseen a child . . . or a mother or a father . . .
for whom the Salk vaccine came too late, then you know’ true
pain. Because you know how it feels to have your hearttorn,
piece by piece, from your body.

Imagine, then, how you’d feel if you were to see—or be—a.
polio victim who could have had the Salk vaccine.. .and dt'.dn’t.’

It's almost unbelievable that this could happen . . . yet last -

summer’s statistics show that perhaps it already has . . .

In 195$, polio cases were reported down 47 % from 1955 . . .
and down 59% from the five-year average for 1951-1955. And
cases dropped most sha,rpl'y in the group which had received
the most vaccine. This was the group of children, 5-9 years of
age, ﬁrst allowed to have the limited vaccine. But, tragicall
enough, not all these eligible children were permitted by their
parents to have the vaccine. _ ‘

Can we afford to let another polio season go by without
giving our children—and ourselves-the protection of the Salk

‘ vaccine? For, bad as it is to see a little one struck down by
this disease, it is just as heartbreaking to see a mother taken
from her family by polio . . . or a fatherleft helpless and un-
able to provide for his family. a

Polio, it must be remembered, is not exclusively a chil-_

dren’s disease. Although it strikes more often in the lower
age groups, it hits hardest among young adults. That’s why
everyone under 40 years of age should be vaccinated.

So get your shots now-—today—and take the whole family
with you. I

No, your polio shots won’t hurt~compared to how your

\

heart will ache if you neglect to have your family vaccinated _

. . . and then polio strikes. -

DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK. It takes 8 monfhsund 3 In.
iections for maximum polio protection. START YOUR
SHOTS NOW. Andi protect the whole family.

Panthers in Ohio State Victory

By LARRY HAGGERTY" ' - '
9 The one thing that pleased Panther Coach Bob-Timmons
about the thrilling 73-70 victory over Ohio State last week,
besides the ﬁne showing of the team, was the strong support
— given to the Jungle Cats by the cheerleaders and students of

' kicking my wife

“I was surprised to hear all that fan support and I know

that is was one of the decidinge

factors in our win over the Buck-
eyes,” commented Timmons.

“It also put me in a better frame
of mind,” he continued when ask-
ed if the vic-
tory over Ohio

raise the play-
ers’-morale.

with John Mesher’s backcourt play
against Michigan so I wanted to
see how Falenski would react to

Young Cats Star
Falenski rewarded his coach
with ‘an outstanding performance.
Not only did he-score seven points,
but he had several key_ steals that
set up fast breaks for the Jungle
Cats. "

Fridley, while a little jittery
on offense, was a tower of
strength defensively in the Pan-
thers’ ﬁrst two games of the
1958-59 campaign. The sopho-
more from Sharon blocked sev-
en shots against the Buckeyes
and four were on the set or
jump-type shots. _

A member of the All—State High
School team in 1956-57, Fridley
came to_ Skyscraper U. with quite
a reputation‘to live up to. He\is
the Panthers’ second leading scor-
er to date with 23 points besides
being their defensive standout.
“He is certainly a ﬁne player,”
commented Assistant Coach Lou
Iezzi.

Mills Grabs Rebounds .
Sawyer, a senior from Mt. Mor-
ris, N.Y., has scored eight points
in each game and is expected to
do a lot of the inside scoring when
the opposition tries to double or
triple-team Hennon.

Hampered by a-skin disease,
Mills, a junior from Beaver, did
not start in the Michigan en-
counter. but he proved to be a
valuable asset against Ohio
State when he led _the team in
rebounds ' with 13. He also
blocked several shots,

John. Guzik Reaiizes
All-American Dream -

LA Draft Selection Named to Five Tetimsg
Consensus of Coaches Rates Him ‘Finest’

John Guzik’s boyhood ambition of j becoming an All-
American football player has come true. Guzik has been_nam-
ed to ﬁve Al1—American squads to date and is the ﬁrst Panther
to gain this honor since Joe Walton performed the almost im-
possible feat of making everyp‘All—American team as an end

in 1956. ‘ “

Honoring’ the Panther guard to
date with a berth on their ‘ﬁrst
teams are United Press Interna-
tional, Sporting News, Look Maga-
zine, Time Magazine, and the
NEA. Guzik also has been named
to every All-East squad that has

_.hit the newsstands or airwaves.

By making the Look squad,
Guzik appeared on the Perry
Como television show last Satur-
day night. “It seemed funny being‘
on TV and not participating in

. actual combat,” said Guzik a 6-

;toot 3-inch, from
Lawrence.
To Play for East

Guzik’s career as a ‘football
player is by no means ﬁnished. He
will play for the East squad in
the annual East-West game on
Dec. 27 in San Francisco and the
Hula Bowl in Honolulu on Jan. 11.
Also participating in the East-
West Shrine game will be two of
Guzik’s teammates, "End Art Gob
and‘ Halfback Dick Haley.

The Hos Angeles-Rams of the
National Football League
thought so highly of Guzik that
they picked" him fourth last
year\ in the annual draft. Guzik
was eligible for. the draft be-
cause his original class was
listed to graduate in I957._

The Blue and Gold’s new All-
American was eligible“ to play an-
other season because he played
only several minutes against West
Virginia in the opening tilt of the
1956 season before suffering a
broken arm.

Given Two More

The Eastern Athletic Associa-
tion ruled that Guzik was allowed
to play two more complete sea-
sons after his unfortunate" inci-
dent against the Mountaineers. .

- Guzik’s arm healed complete-
ly and the 1957 season found
him becoming a. member of the
much publicized “Five Jumbos.”
His counterparts in that ‘group
were Dan Wisniewski, Charley
Brueckman, Jim McCusker, and
Ron Kissel.

Every football observer in the
tri-state area knows what became
of the famous group. Guzik was
the only player that was able to
play .the entire 1957' season, and
the “Jumbos” were so depleted
after last season ended that Guzik
became known as “The Lonely

233-pounder

Jumbo” and had to live this repu- ‘

tation down. .

coach, Earle (Red) Blaik.

“John was the best player I
have ever coached in my career,”
stated Guzik’s high school coach
at Cecil, Val Rizzo. Panther
Coach ,John Michelosen de-
clared, “Guzik is probably the
finest lineman that has ever
played under me.”_

_ Almost every opposing player.
and coach felt the same way about

Guzik that Terry Brennan. of

Notre Dame did. “That Guzik was

all over the ﬁeld and did more to
beat us than anyone else,” de-
clared the.-Irish boss after the

Panthers had downed the boys~

from South Bend in a thrilling 29-
26 game at the Stadium.

’4Guzik is looking forward to his
days as a pro with the Rams. “I

‘certainly hope that I’ll be able to

make the grade,” replied» Guzik.
If. he doesn’t, it will come as a
complete surprise to coaches Mich-
elosen, Blaik, and Brennan.-

. .5 Pitt ‘Players Review

BY MILLARD AMDUR _
A combination of good acting
and a well-chosen play added up
to an outstanding Show for.the‘
Pitt Players in" “The Rainmaker”
last week. ' ‘

the whole play was Tom Hall as
-. Starbuck, ‘ a fantastic, dynamic,
glib-tongued con man, who at this
particular time was posing as a
rainmaker in a drought stricken
area. .
When he was on stage, the other
players were sometimes almost ob-
scured; Hall played the role of a
dreamer, never able to quite come
down to earth and face stark real-
ity, exactly as one might imagine it
“should be played.
-Deputy Well-Portrayed

The second most impressive
‘piece of acting was performed by
William Stewart, who played File,
an,outwardly blase but insecure
deputy sheriff ( afraid to_love again

File was particularly. well- re- '
ceived in his dialogue alone with
Lizzie, the only female in the
presentation.

Alicia Komich, who enacted Liz-
zie, had a most difficult role and
played it competently, but some-
how seemed‘ in her unsophisticat-
ed, countriﬁed part just a little un-
natura_l.

Transformed by Starbuck *

The best portion of her acting
performance came in the latter
part of Act II andthe beginning
of Act III with Liznzie’s undergoing
a miraculous transformation under
‘ thesguidance of smooth Starbuck,
all this taking place in a tack
room’.

The reviewer would have
wished that Lizzie had been a
_bit more sweet and demure, as
Katherine Hepburn exempliﬁed
- in the movie production of the
play, but perhaps this is an un-
fair comparison to make.

A ‘Rainmaker ’ Features
0 "0utstanding’ Acting in

The actor who seemed toshape‘

‘appropriate role should stand out.
years after his wife divorced him‘?

H. C. Curry, father in the
household, played by Herbert
Margolis, was done ‘excellently.
He did not overact at any time,
as some of the other .cast mem-
bers were prone to do and was
convincingly concerned about the
welfare of his daughter.

Noah Poorly Cast

Noah Curry, the older son of
the family, suffered from an ‘over-
ly sarcastic intonation. The fault
in general was not so much with
Donald Marcom’s acting, but with
poor casting. -

It is an odd sensation for a
reviewer to expect an actor in
a certain role to look different
from what he does, but this was
the distinct impression with
Noah.

He didn't seem to be the type
to assume autocratic control of» a.
ranch and family. Mar_com had
deﬁnite acting ability and with an

Jim Delightful Character .
Jim Curry, played by Steve
Gordon, was intended to be a im-
mature, happy—go-lucky younger
son in the family with perhaps
not the greatest intelligence.

By overacting. Qordon em-
phasized Jim’s moronic side but
the audience seemed not to
mind at all, and gave frequent
outbursts of laughter at his an-
,_tics.'- He‘ certainly did play the
—mixed up adolescent, and was a
delightful character.

The remaining player of the
small cast of seven had just a few
lines but both the audience and
the reviewer _thought he played
them in an’ almost ﬂawless
manner. , »

Lacked Student Support

This was‘ Duane Jones who-
played Sheriff Thomas,_ a keen
judge of the personality of his
deputy, File.

All in all, it was a most en-
