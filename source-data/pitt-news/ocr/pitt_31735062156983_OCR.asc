Fresh Open ‘48 Season

With .‘Cramers Caper’

Pitt’s social set will converge on
the William Penn Hotel tonight
for the University’s ﬁrst big affair
of 1948.

Baron Elliot and his orchestra
will provide the music for the
dance which has been titled
“Crammers’ Caper” in dedication
to ﬁnal exams. -

Taking place in the main ball-
room of the hotel,’ the dance will
last from 9 p. m. to l a. m. Ad-
mission is $2.75 per couple.

From a glance at the program it
would seem that those who attend
are in for an enjoyable evening.
of dancing and entertainment.

Elliot’s music has been billed as

the smooth, danceable style, and,

vocalists Norma King and Jimmy
Confer add the ﬁnal touch.

The Baron’s aggregation is the
staff orchestra of WCAE, his Sat-

urday night “Varsity Show” being.

dedicated to Pittsburgh’s three

.major universities and other dis-

trict schools. . .

Second high spot of the evening
will be Jerry Terheyden, who cre--
ated a minor sensation at the Y
Men’s Club smoker last Monday
night with his pantomines, skits,

1 and antics.

Terheyden, a student at.Pea-
body High, plans to enter Tech
drama school in September.

The affair is. sponsored by Pitt’s
freshman class but is open to all.
Dress is informal and the Univer-
sity ruling “no corsages” remains
in effect. . . ,

Asks Vote

Freedom

Student Congress filed a protest V

letter this week in reaction to the
Men’s Council resolution which
binds its elected member in Con-
gress to vote as the Council sees
ﬁt. , -
Students and "faculty members

of Congress defended the right,

of Chuck Davis, Men’s Council’s
representative in Congress, to vote
and argue independently on any
issue dealt with by Student Con-
gress.

Davis was reprimanded by
some members of Men’s Council
last week for publicly denounc-
ing the “compromise amendment”
after the Council had thrown it-
self behind it. ,

Claim‘ Action Unfair

Both the members and faculty
advisors to Congress——T. W. Bid-
dle, dean of men; Miss Helen_,_P.
Rush, dean of women; William
Saalbach, assistant to the dean of
men; and Dr. Louis Johnston, as-
sistant professor of political sci-
ence—agreed that the Council’s
action was dangerous and unfair,

‘and superseded its authority.

Walt Thompson, a member of
Men’s Council, said that he was
against the action taken" by that

body, but contended that the de-- 1

send the protest letter was then
approved unanimously. The let-

iresentation ’ ’ amendment.

-whither Bound

Newspaper policy is always controversial.

_‘ It is usually deﬁnable as opinion.

Earlier this year, the Pitt News published
an editorial declaring that it was solely re-
sponsible for the undertakings of its policy,
and hoped that i-t would incur “no dictation”
from outside sources. Even this statement was
misconstrued by some to indicate that we want-
ed all-or-nothing-at-all.

We are responsible to the University of
Pittsburgh through the Publications Board.
That expresses our ,ﬁrst allegiance. It tells
the story also, that our main purpose in exist-
ing is to further interest in the University, to
make it a better university on a comparative
‘basis. ' ‘

For this purpose we exist, and We do not
intend deviating from that purpose.

During the space of one month, we have
heard inklings of three investigations, attempts

«to curb the “sensationalist” Pitt News, and

many other charges of our corruptibility.
In every instance, the individuals or groups

promoting the probes or arguments objected

to, publicity slights, over—publicity, or news
slanting. In all cases, the individuals or groups
have been guilty of thorough ineifectiveness

in their work,"lack of control over statements

they or their groups have made, or. apparent

lack of consideration for their fellow students.
‘In other cases, we just outright disagree with

them and try to prove why. -

We have based our .originalstand:s and in-
tend answering these charges with our orig-
inal reasons. We plan to adhere to them.

A Big, Fuss

Tuesday ’s News was full of charges and
counter—charges. Men’s Council attacked
Charles Davis, its 'president.;... on his alleged
misconduct concerning the “proportional ,rep-
Miss Helen Pool
Rush, dean of women, and the WSGA defend-
ed use of funds for a letter sent to women
students stating the case pro and con on the

amendment issue.

Front page stu‘ff—that’s what is was. Men ’s

Council waxed indignant and WSGA pleaded

not guilty, as if’ either’ action carried any
weight as far as actual student administration
of student. aaffirs is concerned. '

lThe ‘fact that both stories did make the
front page testiﬁes to what now must be seized
upon as important news. The functioning of

'Men’s Council,‘ and WSGA are so lacking in

important developments, things which affect

\to“any noticeable degree the routine life of
p ,the students, that even these‘ minor squabbles

receive attention out of all proportion to their
significance. p . . _
With the student government so adminis-

tratively ineﬁective it makes hardly a particle

of difference whether Davis did speak out of

‘turn as charged or whether the WSGA did

deviate slightly from the conventional and
accepted use of the small funds at "their dis-
posal. Had the r_esult of either action been of
any- consequence, the disturbance created by
it might have been justiﬁed. As matters stand,
however, it seems as if some people are view-
ing these events through the wrong end of‘ the
glass. ‘ I _ ,

Until the powers of the student governing
groups and meaningful and the functioning
of these units vital to the life of the students,
such petty agitation-s as the Davis and WSGA
incidents will continue to be all that The News
can offer its_readers as “front page stuff.” ‘

College Life

Big I
 Wifh No Probes
By Mike Levine

Three years, I worked to make myself what I
am ‘today. Three years of climbing, of pushing, pe-
titioning, and politics. Three awfully long years
and now I'm a BMOC——which is a pre-war han-
dle meaning: big gun, hot rock, and wheel, rolled
into one.

the marriage course. My letters, to the editor rank
with the best of them. But I have never ‘been
investigated.

Lately. a guy just isn*t worth a Tuck Shop
coke unless he has some one investigating him.
In spite of the fact that it is common knowledge
that, as chess team water boy, I don’t even get
a. shower at University expense, no committee is
appointed to study the situation. , ,

an appointment as publicity chairman of the an-
nual strawberry festival (which went into the,
cause the expression, red). My date was night-

bucks. Everybody knows it, yet I can’t scare up
a little old informal investigation.

Unless someone soon probes me, my career is
doomed. In one last attempt to get my face ‘and-
name on the front page of the papers I want to
announce that I speculate in cafeteria commodi-
ties. When the price of -pie went up I made a.
killing—had my broker buy short and sell long.

At ﬁrst I didn't want to mention this but when

news of my recent proﬁt in refunded bus tokens

came out and nothing happened,’ I got desperate.

If it will help any I’l1 name the campus editor’s
ﬁancee as the cause of it all. But please someone,

please investigate me, or _I am ﬁnished: as a Pitt

big shot.’

Students Want Honor Tests
After Proctor System Try   I

VALPARAISO, Ind.-—-(IP)——-The honor system is again in

effect in all classes at Valparaiso University this year.»
request that the honor systempbe returned in its entirety was

The

presented to the University faculty by the Student Council

and granted by :the faculty prior to the

academic year.

“opening of the present

 Last February, all freshmen and sophomores were placed

under the proctor system. Thise

procedure was regarded as a tem-
porary control measure to be in
effect, until a suitable plan for a
more eﬁflcient working of the hon-
or system could be found.

After careful consideration, the
Student Council last spring ac-
cepted the recommendations of a
special committee appointed for
this purpose. The recommenda-
tions called for ‘the following
changes:

That all new students be no-

tiﬁed prior to their entry in the

school that they will be required , H

to sign the honor pledge; _thatj“the'
honor system be carried through
the summer session; that the ‘hon-
or council be increased from- ﬁve

to nine students; and -that more .

publicity be given the activities of
the honor council. - ~ i
All these measure have already
been put into pfactice. The fresh-
man class wholeheartedly pledged
its support to the honor system.‘

Dr. Sones Places Comics

 

?4UncIer Educational Status

  

' of knowledge and
. world affairs.

V By Vivian Colonna
Dr. Warren W. Sones, profes-

. sor of education, has it all over

the palmist who traces life lines
and the gypsy who pours over tea
leaves.

“Tell me honestly what comic
strips you prefer and I’ll give
you, a better character reading
than they can,” he said.

And he won’t charge you 50
cents either. He's interested in
ﬁnding out what comics people
like and more important, why.

“Comics _ are national projec-
tion tests,” says Dr. Sones. “Read-
ers prefer those strips in which
they can identify themselves with
the characters. Besides giving this
satisfaction, funnies relieve ten-
sion. During the crisis of the 30’s
-the bulk of modern comic strips
got their start. '

“A cartoon ‘is a narrative even
though the story can be seen at
a glance,” said Dr. Sones, re-
‘ferring to the speech he made
Wednesday evening at the Com-
munications Workshop of New
York University on ‘What Are the
Factors Which Make an Effective
‘Cartoon Narrative.’

“That is its advantage. The
reader has an immediate feeling
for the material.

Comics have grown up. They
have come a long way from “the
Yellow Kid. Even the immortal
Ignatz Mouse and his brick toss-
ing have died out. They have been
replaced by educational strips
such as Harold R. Fo-ster’s “Prince
Yalient,” a picture history of the
days of King Arthur, and ‘Dick’s

I Adventures’ by Neil O’Keefle and

Max Trell, in which a young lad
dreams himself into chapters of
history such as Columbus’ dis-
covery of America‘ and the Pil-
grims’ landing at Plymouth Rock.

“Comics -such as these have a
deﬁnite place in education,” be-

Dr. Sones of the School of Education likes to ﬁnd out what comics
the public likes and why.

A.
T

lieves -Dr. Sones, “not in them-
selves, but as a supplement to
textbooks.”

He points out that a textbook in
duplicating the story told on one
page of ‘Prince Valient’ would re-
quire at least 2500 words to de-
scribe the scenery, wild life, per-

evening at the Stadium, and
walked away with a 36-14 game.

Sparked by the accurate pass-

Natators Engage  
Fenn at Cleveland e a

One of the most difficult hurdles in the drive of the Panther
swimmnig team toward the Eastern Intercollegiate title and perhaps
National Collegiate and Olympic representation is forthcoming to-

night in Cleveland.

There, Fenn College’s powerful natators engage Ben Grady’s
traveling tankers in the ﬁrst of two dual meets in two days in the

Ohio city.

vides the opposition. Both Cleve-
land opponents are new to the

meets with Slippery Rock, Edin-
bore, and Penn State.

Geneva Trip Follows

A trip to Geneva, followed in
March by the Eastern Collegiates
at Rutgers, and possibly the Na-
tional Collegiates at Michigan,
complete an ambitious program
mapped for the local mermen.

Head Mentor Grady is immedi-
ately concerned with Fenn. The
Clevelanders scored impressively
over Edinboro and Westminster,
and are paced by Bob Bushey who
is breaking pool free-style records
with monotonous regularity.

Captain Walt Jackson, Paul
Brugger, and Don Wilde fortify
,the Panther free-style contingent,
along with distance ace Mike Le-
vine. All are lettermen from last
year’s team which won four of six
dual meets.

Free-styler Dave Cannon was
the only graduation loss from the
’47 squad coached by Howard
Waite. ‘

Dick Petro, frosh sensation and
AAU free style‘ record breaker
from Uniontown,'will be a wel-
come addition when he becomes
eligible next semester. Petro is
considered. a good bet for the
Olympic swimming team by many
observers.

Bill Manko and Bill Cochran,
backstroke specialists, and Harry
Lucas, breastroker, are other let-’
termen back. Bill Grant, back-
stroker, is another holdover. '

The Panther breastroke con-
tingent was_ the only one which

Bethany. 68-40  

Pitt’s hustling quints coupled a
ﬁre wagon attack with deadly
long range shooting to stampede
the Herd from Bethany, 68-40,
at the Stadium Wednesday night.

In command throughout, the
Panthers netted 25 out of 58 goals‘
from the ﬁeld and dropped 18 out
of,27 at the foul line in register-
ing their ﬁfth straight win.

Steady Bill Cieply topped Bison
Captain Frank Dumisinecz by
one point to win scoring laurels
with 16 markers. But the front
line trio of David, Cecconi, and
Canterna totaled 35 points and
befuddled Bethany with their fast
break. . .

On defense, the Panthers em-
ployed a harassing man-for—man
which limited the Bisons to 1'3
ﬁeld goals in 41 tries. Three of
these were garnered by district
scoring leader Jim Mewhirter ‘who
pitched in 12 tallies.

Pitt led 24-11 at the first quar-
ter and 44-22 at the intermission.
