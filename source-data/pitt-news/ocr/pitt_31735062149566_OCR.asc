traditional highspot of the Univer- T

sity year-—looming ﬁve school-
weeks away, plans for the six-day
program swing into high gear to-
day with the announcement of a
full calendar of festival activities.

Adhering to tradition on just one
point, the announcement that “this
year’s program is to be the most co-
lossal in University history,” the fes-
tival committee heads, under the
chairmanship of Edwin Ellis, C39,
list today a four-star program of
spring features:
FOUR STARS

1. For pinched budgets, a $5.00
book of tickets that promises a saving
ofl$2.45.

2. For the tradition seeking, the
dedicating of a Senior Walk recogniz-
ing outstanding senior classmen, past
and present.

3. For the sensational touch, a
beard-growing contest with loving
cups for the richest and most colorful
appendages produced in a scheduled
period, yet to be announced by Ray
Light, C39, contest chairman.

4. A full week replete with 18
festival activities: three dances, a
novel carnival night, an amateur
premier by the Pitt Players, and a
full program of sports events.
BOOKS OF TICKETS

The books of tickets will go on sale
Wednesday, March 29. A two-dollar
deposit will hold a book until festival
week, May 8-15.

The beards, scheduled to appear
about April 17, are timed to reach a
state of excellence in fullness, color,
and shape-—with the help of sunshine
and precipitation—on the ﬁrst day of
Spring Festival week. The contest is
open to all undergraduates; “details

The calendar of activities for the
week as announced by Ellis is printed
on page four.

Yugoslavs Plan

Room will be dedicated Friday eve-
ning by Constantin Fotitch, Yugo-
slav minister to the United States.

The dedication will feature Yugo-

Fallon Dislikes Stage as Career,

Acts in Summer

Theater Project

Story and Cut
By Bill Patrick

Most people dream of occupations
other than the thing they do for a
living.

But not Martin Fallon, C31, direc-
tor of “At Your Service,” 1939 Cap;
and Gown production. Red-haired
Mr. Fallon likes best of all, even
above his passion for the professional
theater, to teach drama and speech.
He is on the faculty of the School of
Drama at Duquesne university.

In spite of the fact that he has had
a wide experience as director and
actor in the professional theater, Mr.,
Fallon expresses a dislike for the
stage as a career.

A
7

He cites two reasons for not choos- ;
ing the stage as a profession. He be- I
lieves that actors in the American
theater do not have enough repre- ,
sentaticn or equity in the joroductioni
of shows. Actors are signed up on
indeﬁnite contracts. with speciﬁed .
salary, and regardless of receipts,
they get no more. If the show clicks,
the producer cleans up. “The actors
should have some part in running the
theater as well as acting in it,’ he be-
lieves.

‘His second reason for taboo on act-
ing is that he doesn’t like to live in

hotels and out of suitcases. Says he,
“I’m a kind of sucker for rose gar-
dens and that kind of stuff.”

He played as a soldier in the re-
cent production of “Hamlet” with
Leslie Howard, (he admits, “I said
one line to Howard,") and he had
parts among others _in “Streets of

Pittsbkurgh Trade

Index Climbs Again

Spurred by better-than-seasonal
gains in production and orginating
shipments, Pittsburgh business start-
ed climbing last week, reaching 86-7
per cent of 1923-25 activity, reports
the Bureau of Business Research.

Big business was responsible for
most of the higher operating ratio,
the most impressive increase being
reﬂected in steel and industrial elec-
tric power production. River traffic
and rail tonnage rose proportionally,
bringing the adjusted indexes of pro-
duction and shipments near the same
level, for the ﬁrst time this year.

Department store business, de-
spite a shorter period for pre—Easter
trade, only rose 2 per cent in the last
month. ‘

Men Debate U. S.
Spending at Forum

Federal spending for the purpose
of stimulating business will be the
subject of an intercollegiate discus-
sion between two representatives of
the Men’s Debating Association and
a team from Penn State college at
Inquiry Forum, today at 1 o’clock, in
129 Cathedral.

To establish the afﬁrmative of the
question, “Resolved: That the United.
States should cease to use public
funds for the purpose of stimulating
business,” will be the case of Hyman
Richman, C39, and Abe Horowitz,
C40. Penn State will uphold the neg-
ative.

Today’s debate is the third in a
series to be presented by Inquiry
Forum. The topic is an appropriate
one at this time, as debating teams
are discussing the pros and cons of
the subject throughout the country,
according to Horowitz.

St. Peter Opens the

Gates . . .

By Edgar Beigel
“You read what you don’t see,”
said Dr. Wilfred St. Peter, professor

onstration for this reporter in his
Thaw Hall laboratories, explaining
isolated features of the mystic me-
dium of light.

Dr. St. Peter explained that the
human animal reads “by contrast,”
;that is, by detecting interruptions on
a white sheet of paper. Human be-
ings conjure symbols (letters), words,
and ultimately sentences.

In answer to the query, “What Is
Light?” Peter Vissat, graduate stu-
dent assistant in physics, offered
some theoretical explanation. “Light
is either a stream of corpuscles ﬂy-
ing through space like kites on a
windy day,” he offered, “or it is a
conglomerate of waves of energy
passing from one body to another.”

A tour with Dr. St. Peter through
the labyrinth of physics “labs” re-
,vealed, in addition to polaroids,
charged balloons, ﬂuoroscopes, mi-
croscopes, light charts, and galvano-
meters, a dark light, three times the
size of an ordinary incandescent bulb.
This, he explained, was an ultra-
violet lamp. 1

|photographer’s “darkroom,” we were
‘amazed at the sudden illumination
of an apparently ordinary dust rag,
,the soft glow of a string of beads,
and the bright blue light given off by
a ﬂask of quinine, all reactions [to
rays of energy from the ultra-violet
light. ‘
“This is due to the change of posi-
tions of the electrons in the molecules
of ﬂuorescent paint, applied to the
objects,” Dr. St. Peter pointed out‘,
when the molecules were struck by
ultra-violet rays. Just as clothes
absorb light, a photo-electric cell
generates electricity in reaction to
light, so the force of energy caused
by the ultra-violet lamp brings a
shift of electrons which in turn pro-
duce so-called visible light-and we
see this illumination, or ﬂuorescence.
The latest commercial application.
of this principle, the results of an "ex-.
, periment by the General Electric lab-
oratories, are thin, elongated. glass:
tubes, coated on the inside with: ﬂu-
orescent paint. When ultra-violet:
rays from a heated tube of murcui-yr
vapor strike the painted glass,._the~
illuminationis so great that a,,,15
watt bulb gave much more light 
an ordinary 60 watt incandescent
light. ‘

We go to school and learn all about the poor boy who

made good.

How to ‘Make Good’

“Making good’ generally means becoming a political

' force, which is done by “assisting” in a political cam-
paign, or pointing out how someone else has too freely

assisted himself, or offering a spotless record for your
party to hang its dubious principles upon. Of course
“making good” also includes donating to the public,
like presenting a beautiful and expensive building that
will feed the souls of the beholders and the ego of the
benefactor. And who in America would not like with

' all his heart to be such a benefactor; no matter how he

had to adjust his conscience to do it? (You and I are
the exceptions, of course.)

And then there are the movie stars. Oh, to be a fa-

mous movie star, to ride in beautiful cars, and give

enormous parties; to cry all over the silver screen and
be pestered for an autograph. (You and I are included
this time.) The country is full of wide-eyed and nar-

--row-visioned youths all wanting to be Tyrone Power or
T I-Iedy Lamarr.

his new merit system which has entered the fra-

The idea of nomination for merit was taken up 
the houses outside the big four——who include Phi Eps, 
Kaps. Cams and Delts—to evade the boss tastics that‘;
Barr and Hamburg used to create the one big partyi
which resulted in last year’s plebes e.

cit

Last year evcrything was done at the top. The
bosses di=.A'3d,ed the spoils the way they wanted to divide
them. Hamburg stayed in Florida until it was too late l
for any dissident house to do anything but join thel
coalition, and to take whatever was offered when the
caucus was ﬁnally held.

Dissident Houses

There were plenty of dissident houses, too, when
Hamburg and Barr dished things out. They naturally
got the best things for their own group. But, with less
than a week remaining, nobody could do anything
about it. |

This year things were different. Downie and Mayer 
weren’t of the same caliber as last year’s strong men.
The independents appeared in force. The old Dent
myth was exploded when Widney just inched into SFA
at the last election. I

So, when the caucus was held the houses insisted on
fair play. No more dictating. Every man was chosen
by ballot for his position. This resulted in certain in-
consistencies, especially for the former leading houses.
Some of their candidates were voted down. They
wc—rent getting things by bossing. But the other houses
are for it.

They ought to be. Formerly things were dished out
on the basis of house strength; which put the small
houses behind the eight-ball and kept their candidates
out of position they might deserve. But with the merit
system every fraternity man has an equal chance, if he
can convince the party caucus which is the nominating
convention, that he is worthy.

Coeds Still Unslated

Right now these nominations aren’t being placed on
slates for two reasons:

First, the women’s fraternities aren’t slated as yet.
They have just decided to remain in politics and to enter
their candidates on slates. Panhel Council was attempt-
ing‘ to keep women away from politics.

But one politico -pulled the number one retort of the
week, when she said that she wouldn’t “mix ethics with
politics” and was going to get her candidates elected by
the usual political way.

This broke the slate boycott, but so far the women’s
houses haven’t made the necessary political affiliations.

he second thing which held up fraternity slating
was Bud lVIayer’s Phi Eps who weren’t satisﬁed and left
the coalition. Hoeveler refused with pleasure Mayer’s
offer of 100 votes in exchange for a seat in Men's Coun-
cil.

Penn .

John Nesbitt’s “Passing Parade” which has brought
you numerous entertaining short features, is current at
the Penn depicting highlights in the life of Alfred Nobel,
the man who invented dynamite.

Nobel in making his discovery did so in the hopes
of advancing civilization. The birth of the explosive did
for a while. It was used to gouge out the side of moun-
tains; it blasted through miles of underground rock,
enabling railroads to build short-cut routes; it was used
to smash ice packs and to splinder
log jams; but he never expecte_d—'it
to be used for man’s destructidn
in war.

When his explosive was used for
horrible anihilation in combat,
Nobel invented more fearful ones,
hoping to create one so terrible
that it would stop war.

His attempt to ﬁght fear with
fear was useless. Evidence of his
futility lay on hospital beds, in

twisted, shattered bits of suffering humanity, and be-
neath rows of orderly crosses on battleﬁelds.

Now a wealthy man and with but a few short re-
maining years of life, Nobel thought that his only re-
demption would be in offering a yearly prize to the one
who had done the most each year toward promoting
world peace.

The narrator’s closing statement is a. signiﬁcant com-
mentary on our present civilization when he pleads,
“Where is the man who is being sought by the spirit of
Alfred Nobel?” And with armies ready to march at the
sign of a raised hand or a clenched fist, we sit back and
wonder.

Alex Kuhn, Pitt grad, wrote a song for Ethel Shutta.

thinks the “kiddie song” is a winner. Because of a

but she’ll include it in future programs. Bill Provost,
Pittsburgher, helped Alex in its writing.

ECCENTRIC
JANITOR AT ST.

   

 

FOR 23 YEARS, I905-I928.’

By Alice M. Benovitz

Well may European educators with
their unimaginative Lycees, gymna-
siums, degrees, grades, and doctorates
gape with undisguised amazement, if
not admiration, at the American ed-
ucational landscape. A particularly
luxurious type of scholarly vegeta-
tion is Stephens college in Columbia,
Missouri.

Stephens recently broke into the
headlines—and some very news-
worthy pictures—as a result of its
mass female migration across the na-
tion. On the school’s annual junket
were 520 students, James Madison
(“Daddy”) Wood, Stephen’s presi-
dent, two nurses, and twenty faculty
members.

The purpose of the trip seems to
be rather vague, something about
seeing the country, but the cost per
student, $165, sounds rather deﬁnite.
Since part of the “functional”. curri-
culum is‘ devoted to teaching charm
and ability to converse wittily, if not
intelligently, the junket was arranged
to permit ﬁeldwork at cities where
(eligible) young men might be met.

Their ﬁrst stop was Washington
where they officially kissed Congress-
men and Vice President Garner,
danced with the newspaper corre-
spondents, the diplomatic corps, and
students of three local colleges. They
then danced their way to New York
via West Point and Annapolis.
Following two hectic days in New
York, the “Childrens Crusade” en-
barked in two ships for the educa-
tional shores of Florida. There they
dated the University of Florida. Aft-
er that, half of the group ﬁgured
they had absorbed all the education‘
they wanted, but the other half went l
to Texas for the purpose of dating
Texas Agricultural and Mechanical
college.

With admirable thoroughnesss, the
dates had been arranged in advance
by sending the age, weight, and
height of the girls on to the men. The
papers don’t mention it, but one sup-
poses that upon registering at Ste-
phens, the frcshman places on a card
all her physical dimensions and
states whether she likes blonde or
brunnette men. _

Then, after examining the cata-
logue of courses she probably regis-
ters for a stiff schedule of three cred-
its of charm, two of conversation,
four in cosmetics, three credits in
“How to Impress West Point,” and
four credits in “What to Say at An-

Sports Editor

Mr. Ed Guthman,

‘Sports Editor, ‘Washington ﬁDail)',
University of Y\'ashingt.on, Seattle.

Ed :

In re your memorandum of March 20, I shall attempt an enlight-

cnment.

As a preface, let me tell you that there are certain ramiﬁ-

cations to our football condition that escape and tend to bewilder
even those who are on the battleground.
Now vour immediate inquiry concerns the present status of
football atuPitt, particularly as to how it will affect your Huskies
A

when they play their opening g’c1m€'

next fall with these particular Pan-
thers.
YVHAT OF FUTURE?

The ﬁrst part of your question-
naire does not really have much
bearing on what you really want to
know, so we will dismiss it lightly.
'I say this because the chief point of
alarm in football’s present status at
our University is one that will be no
concern of yours. It is the problem
of what is going to hapen, not next
year, but the years after next foot-
ball season. It is the problem of
:football’s future at Pitt. How is
Pitt going to maintain its present
equality with gridiron powers such
-as yours which are on its schedule?

I know that Jock, before he re-
signed, was given no assurance of
how the realities of this situation
could be met. But, Chisel Bowser,
our new coach, seems conﬁdent that
Pitt will “always be a football pow-
er.” It is possible that things have
changed in the last week. Anyway,
he knows much more about that
than I do.

EXPECT ANYTHING

Getting down to what you really

want to know, I can tell you that you

should be prepared to see anything]

‘happen out on that Seattle gridiron
in September. There has been a
great outpouring of despair over the
situation here. I think, as I said be-
fore, it is not so much with what
will happen next year, but what is
in store after that.

I can’t give you too much of an
inside on what our team will be like
‘next year as yet. Chisel won’t an-
nounce his coaching staff until to-
morrow and practice won’t begin
‘until Wednesday. But, I have some
substantial ideas.

Chisel inherits some really good
material. As a matter of fact, in
potentiality, the line can shape up to
be better than ever.

Nothing Doing

Congo Fuller-l‘

ton is the closest thing to a Shot-
well we have had at center since
George left school. He should de-
velop this coming season. Butch
Klein has the makings of another
All-American guard and Rudy Grad-
isek, his running mate, is not far
behind.

At tackles there will be Ted
Konetsky, a veteran, who should be
much improved this year and Hafer
and Kristufek on the other side. Joe
Rettinger is a great end. His mate
should either be Jack Goodridge or
Earl Pressel, both of whom have the
makings. There you have the line.
They may only be names to you. To
those who have been close to the
Pitt team, they seem capable of being
molded into a great line.

PLENTY OF MATERIAL

Only one of the dreamers back in
the backﬁeld will be Dandy Dick
Cassiano, our Whizzer White, who
should be in line for a Rhodes
scholarship himself. Ben Kish will
be at quarterback, and while he isn’t
comparable to the mad one, he is a
fullback that would look good on any
man’s team. Only right halfback
is the question mark. There are
three candidates outstanding, Bon-
nelli, Naric, and Thurbon. One of
them is sure to develop into a capa-
ble replacement for Curly. Then
we have our freshman team coming
up. They, have been tagged as the
“greatest group of Panther cubs ,1
years.” , «

So you see, Ed, thereiwil be an
abundance of material. And, also
the boys have one very good reason
to point for this opening game. The
feeling is that if they can get by
your Huskies the season will be
made. This one game has been set
up as the barometer for the year.

It should be an interesting after-
noon out on the coast next fall.

News Sport Scribes Look Ahead
To Dull Week on Athletic Beats 7

_ By Bill Mazefsky
Things were dull around the sport’s desk last Week with only

two resignations, a trustee ’s investi
inors springing from the Pitt athle

gation, and a couple of vague ru-

tic situation.

This was a considerably slower pace than the previous week when

nothing less than a “stop-press”
There was plenty of trouble in the
nitely hot. The sudden slow up may¢

prove rather boring to the boys who
gather sport copy for the Pitt News.

Unless one of those surprises sud-
denly erupt, and they do erupt with
uncomfortable frequency, this week
-ought to be easy on the boys’ blood
pressure. Big splash of the week will
be the newly named football aides of
‘Charley “Chisel” Bowser.

Sometime during the week Bowser
will call forth the remains of the 1938
football varsity, the remains of the
fresh team, his new football aides,
and start spring training for the 1939
football season that opens abruptly
with the vengeance seeking Washing-
‘ton State Huskies.

This week will also see Coach Mit-
terling carefully scan his squad for a
varsity nine to throw against George-
‘town’s veteran baseball team on the
season’s opener, April 11.

Coach Carl Olson will be re-
shuffling his track team for the out-
door season. The fraternities will be
wielding bats, in a drive for the mush-
ball crown as will the independents.

So the sport beat ought to settle
down to some degree of complacency.
The resignation possibilities have just
about run about. And this week
ought to be another comparatively
dull week around the sport’s desk.
But you can never tell, there are still
a couple of unsquelched rumors ﬂoat-
ing about.

Tilts for

By Bill McElWain

A week of practice games seems
to be the schedule facing the Pitt
baseballers since coach Ralph Mit-
terling is anxious to see how the
boys shape up under actual play-
ing conditions.

The Panthers have a long way to
go before they will be ready to step
into collegiate competition. With high
school ball the only diamond back-
ground of most of the candidates, Mit-
terling has a right to the pessimism
expressed in his remark:

“I didn't realize there would be so
much to do. The inﬁeld isn’t settled,
I’m not sure of my outﬁeld, and the
pitchers haven’t had to put the ball
past the batters yet.”

OUTFIELD WEAK

Almost the entire practice period
last Friday was spent in lofting fungo
ﬂies to prospective outﬁelders. The
dearth of high grade ﬂy Chasers was
painfully apparent as balls dropped in
front of hesitant ﬁelders or sailed
over their heads again and again.

Four or ﬁve men handled their as-
signment with assurance. A poten-
tial ﬁrst string outer garden at the
msesent garden would include Kieper,
Geltz, and Ripp, the ﬁrst of whom
was just about the classiest outﬁelder
in the intr"-imural league last spring
i Pitcher Joe Treola was also work-
1

ing with the pasture crew and should

I he make good as a retriever, a proba-
'bility, Mitterling would be able to
carry an extra man on his squad.

Smooth inﬁelding should be a fea-
ture of this year’s club. The inﬁeld
workouts have been the liveliest por-
tions of the practices thus far with
little Eddie Straloski and husky Bob
Foliart handling grounders cleanly
and making bullet throws to set the
pace for the rest of the squad. ’
REAL TEST TO COME

Behind the bat there has been a
lack of competition that may make
the department a weakness. Not that
George Hartman and Salko won’t be
fairly adequate but without anyone
pushing them for the job, there may
be a tendency for the boys to let
down. '

The real test for the Panthers will
come when they begin to swing their
bats at curve balls and drops. Thus
far, the pitchers have done little more
than lay the ball down the middle and
the batters have been letting go from
the heels and punching the ball to all
corners of the Stadium.

Against a real delivery, the slug-
gers will have more trouble getting
the range. The possible extent of that
trouble is one of Mitterling’s big
headaches just now. With tossers
such as will be served up by Duke,
Georgetown, and North Carolina, the
Panther nine will need sharp batting
eyes.

VVith less than a month remaining
before the ﬁrst game, Mitterling will
have little time to spend with the
freshmen. The diﬁiculties that have
arisen make it imperative that the be-
ginning of frosh practice be delayed
until after Easter recess.

With the arrival of spring weather,¢

the fraternities put aside political
caucus’ and took up the race for the
mushball championship last Thurs-
day.

Mushball is the opening sport in
the spring program and is the lead-off
sport for the All-Point trophy of
1939-1940.

Sigma Alpha Mu, with Lew Mend-
low hurling, handed the defending
champions, Kappa Sigma, a 5-2 set-
back. One of the two Kappa Sig runs
was the result of a Ruthian swat off
George Kracum’s bat, the ball trav-
elling on a dead line over the left
ﬁeld fence.

SIX RUN BURST

Delta Tau Delta, last year’s runner-
up, jumped to a flying start, winning
from Phi Kappa, 9-4. Harry I-Iolt
was the victorious twirler, and Joe
Connell had his ﬁrst defeat of the
season chalked against him.

Pi Kappa Alpha pulled one out of
the ﬁre against Theta Chi coming
from behind in the ﬁnal inning to
wipe out a 6-1 deﬁcit to triumph, 7-6.
Ray Light pitched the whole game for
the winners, and footballer Murphy
hurled for the losers. Edgar Jones
was the batting hero of the game,
lacing two extra base hits in three
trips to the plate.

Phi Gamma Delta won in a walk
from Sigma Chi, 22-3. Pressell and
Thurbon had four and three hits re-
spectively to pace the victors. Doug
Smith was on the mound for the Fijis
and Bellas southpawed for Sigma Chi.

“Bernie” Cashdollar pitched the Phi

Series Ends Tonight At Garden. Arena

Reverting to regular season?

season form, the Panthers and
the Dukes literally and ﬁgurative-
ly fought‘ through 45 minutes of
bruising hockey’ Saturday night
with Pitt winning 3-1 to throw
the series into another match this
evening.

The McSorley-coached outﬁt had
to come from behind to win, but was
clearly the superior club throughout
the battle. The Dukes scored ﬁrst,
but Pitt blinked the red light in each
of the three periods, Schildecker,
Friday, and Brittain producing the
tallies.

As had been the case in the ﬁrst
two games of the playffs, the officials,
Patsy Callighan and Mike Brophy
of Cleveland, called penalty after
penalty, and though several ﬁghts
started, they were smothered before
they had reached the riot stage.
IUNGERICH VICTIMIZED

Both clubs came through in the
ﬁrst‘ period. Halfway through the
session Bill Vance, Harry Foster, and
Jimmy Unger went down on a per-
fect three man break, Vance sliding
the puck to Foster who blazed away.
As Ellis made a neat save, Unger,
coming in from the right side, took
the rebound and batted it into the
open cage at 8206.

Alex Iungerich was the victim of
a break score at 11:12 of the period
when Bill Schildecker shot for the
left side of the neta from back of
center ice. The Dukes’ goalie had
plenty of time to see the disc coming
but let it roll over his stick and
across the line to tie the count.

Earlier in the game, Walter McGill,
Duquesne wing, broke up a Pitt at-
tack that featured Schildecker and

Schooley, then slithered along the
ice on his stomach and gouged his
head on Iungerich’s skate.
Penalties for Artz, Connick, and
Unger late in the frame gave the
Dukes a ﬁve to four edge in man
power when the second period start-
ed. The second stanza was lively
throughout with the puck going from
one end of the arena to the other in
quick succession. Pat Cusick and
Jimmy Unger went to the penalty
box in the eleventh minute, Unger
with a three minute sentence for
ﬁghting while Pat drew a minute for

roughing. _ _
Schaeffer was detected tripping
two minutes later and the Dukes
were two men down but managed to
hold off a Pitt drive. Tate Brittain’s

Iungerich’s pads and stopped in the
crease where a Duke defense man
cleared it.

With 32 seconds to go, Bob
Schooley and Unger mixed it up in
front of the Duquesne goal and were
handed majors for ﬁghting. On the
ensuing faceoﬁ, Dick Friday skidded
the puck past two Dukes and slap-

cage to put Pitt ahead 2-1 at 14:35.
BRITTAIN SCORES

Playing in the ﬁnal frame was even.
and only a little lively until the
seventh minute. Pat Cusick’s back-

Iungerich’s frantic lunge and on the
next face off, the Dukes carried the
puck deep into the Pitt defense zone
where I-Iansberry dribbled a tricky
roller across the crease. Ellis man-
aged to fall on it just as it reached
the goal line.

Bob Schooley and Tatey Brittain
wliizzed down the i-ce after the face
oﬂ, Schooley passing over from the
left side to Tate who beat Iungerich
with a high backhand into the cords
at 7:54.

Bill Vance, Duke ace, who had
taken a terriﬁc beating all evening,
was tripped by Ozzie Artz at 11:47.
Both went down but Vance leaped
on Artz and began to pound him

pair but when Vance objected to his
major by swinging at Brophy, the
referee slapped on a match miscon-
duct penalty that took Vance out for
the rest of the game.

Springfield Team
Proves Popular

Before some 2,500 spectators,
Springﬁeld Co1lege’s tumbling and
gym team put on a remarkable ex-
hibition of pyramid building, gym-
nastic work, and tableau perform-
ances that left the audience asking
for more at the end of the two and
a half hour exhibition.

Karl Oermann, University phy-
sical education teacher, was re-
sponsible for the local appearance
of the team, hoping that by the
showing here the student body

will become suﬁiciently enthused
about gymnastics to make it pos-
sible for Pitt to have a varsity
team engaging in competition next
year.

Fine Arts Department ‘Ti

Displays New Prints _

I

By Anita Barone l

A comprehensive collection of con- 1
temporary Swedish art is the current E
exhibit in the Fine Arts galleries, f
seventh ﬂoor, Cathedral. 

The works of 35 prominent Swe-:
dish artists are represented, and the;
show covers the entire range of cur- 3
rent graphic art, including wood‘;
cuts, etchings, dry point, linoleum}
cuts, and lithographs. '

BIBLICAL SUBJECTS _

The prints reﬂect neither the man- 
nerisms nor the approach of Anders;
Zorn, who is known in America asé

the best Swedish etcher, but show;
the inﬂuence of French and Englishl
graphic art. }

Particularly interesting is the work 
of Par Siegard, which shows deﬁnite,
French inﬂuence. His subjects are]
Biblical, treated abstractly as designs 
in pattern and color. His block print, '
“Descent from the Cross,” is typical
of his work.

“Mutual Surprise” is one of the
amusing etchings by Ossian Elgstrom.

An excellent character study is the
wood cut by Sigge Bergstrom en-
titled “My Father.”

ARMS RESPONSIBLE

The exhibition is touring the
United States through the efforts
John Taylor Arms, president of the
Society of American Etchers. Mr.
Arms arranged for the exchange of
201 American prints for this show
of 185 Swedish prints.

Mr. Arms devotes much of his time
to assembling American shows
abroad and serving on international
juries, for he believes that cultural
ties pave the way for a better under-
standing between nations.

The American prints have been on
tour in Scandinavian and Central
European countries during the past
two years, and the current exhibit
of Swedish prints has toured— the
leading museums of this country
since November, 1937.

New York” and “On the Spot” in
summer theater projects.

The summer projects, he explained,
consist of small groups of profes-
sional actors and technicians who es-
tablish themselves in some small
town, rig up an old barn for studio
and theater, and produce some six
plays in six weeks.

“We run one show at night, break
and set the business of the next in the
day, and study the lines for the third
between times,’ he says. That means
work on three shows at the same
time, with one actually before an
audience every week.

Fallon had roles in Cap and Gown
shows when he was in school, and he
thinks C&G is the best activity on
campus.

He believes, however, that the ac-
tivity should be conducted more by
the students, and less by the ruling
graduate club which controls the
present organization.

He recommends a “long-distance
approach” for the Cap and Gown pro-
ductions. This would include writ-
ing, submitting, and judging of books
almost a year ahead of time. In this
way, the story can be completed and
the name of the show announced by
the middle of September.

Students will then be able to write
songs for spots in the show, instead of
the present method of adapting the
show to ﬁt music. By having the
plans completed before—time, the
show can be “plugged” for a road
trip, Fallon claims.

PLEASURE

    
  

AGEING-Chesterﬁeld’s mild

mildness and better taste which give
millions of smokers more pleasure.

esting stemming machines, whose
ﬁngers pick up the tobacco, leaf
by leaf and take out the stem,_
leaving only the mild, tender,
good-tasting part of the leaf to go
into the making of Chesterﬁelds.

   

Bl.ENDlNG—-There is only one
Chesterﬁeld blend . . . the blend
that can’t be copied . . . a happy
combinarion of the world's best
American and Turkish tobaccos.
Just the right proportions to make
Chesterfield a milder, better-tast-
ing cigarette.

 

PAPER—Every Chesterﬁeld you
smoke is wrapped in pure cigarette
paper. . . the ﬁnesfcigarette paper
made. That's another reason why
Chcsterﬁelds are milder and bet-
ter-tasting.

  
   

MAKING-—Almost faster than
the eye can follow, Chesterﬁelds
come rolling out of the marvel-
ous cigarette making machines.
C/zesterﬁelds are aIwa_vs'round, ﬁrth
and well-ﬁlled.

PACKAGlNG—Truly amazing
are the packaging machines which
wrap and seal Chesterﬁelds in
their air-tight, moisture-proof
packages. Regardless of. where
you buy them, Clzesterﬁelds reach
you as fresh as the day they were
made.
