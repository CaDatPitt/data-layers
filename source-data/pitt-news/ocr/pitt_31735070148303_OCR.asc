Police crackdowns
raise concerns

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ Writer

As the Occupy movement contin-
ues to grow, so do the number of
participant arrests‘.

Police have arrested more than
3,000 protesters nationwide since
the Occupy Wall Street movement
began on Sept. 17 and spread to
cities across the country. Last
month, police arrested more than
100 people in Boston and more
than 700 protesters on the Brook-
lyn Bridge. This past weekend, po-
lice arrested 17 people in Denver
because they had items such as a
grill blocking the sidewalk.

The First Amendment guaran-
tees the right to peaceful assembly,
yet people are being arrested and,
at times, pepper—sprayed. Lawyers
and police explained the ways laws
can govern protests — and some-
times restrict them.

_“Reasonable” force

Last month, former U.S. Ma-
rine Scott Olsen was hit in the head
by a tear gas canister launched by
police during a protest in Oakland,
Calif. Olsen’s injury has shifted
some ofjthe media focus on the
movement recently to include op-
position to police brutality." '_

Police have the authority to use
force to arrest people who they
suspect of committing crimes, but
there’s a limit to how much force
they can use. Using excessive force
in arresting an individual can vio-
late civil rights, bring disciplinary
or criminal action against arrest-
ing olﬁcers and cause serious in-
juries or death. The line between
too much force and just enough
becomes increasingly blurred
when police dealwith the unpre-
dictable situations presented by
large groups.

In the 1989 court case Graham
v. Connor, the Supreme Court
found that “the ‘reasonableness’

of a particular use of force
must be judged from
the perspective
of a rea-
son-

able officer on the

embody an allowance for the
fact that police officers are of-
ten forced to make split—second
decisions about the amount of

force necessary in a particular situ-
ation.”

Roll call honors fallen soldiers

Tiffany Grossi
Staﬁ" Writer

Sophomore Sefra Lao’s father has
served in the Marines for more
than 20 years. He’s currently based
in California, and her brother will
soon follow in their father’s foot-
steps. But she never immediately
knew the signiﬁcance of their ef-
forts. ,

A Lao, who works in the.Ofﬁce
of Veterans Services onjcampus,

A was asked to volunteer at the

Veterans Day roll call on Friday
in the Tansky Family Lounge in
the William Pitt Union.‘ Lao and
about 30 other Pitt students staff

and faculty spent seven hours on
Veterans Day readingthe names of ,

the 6,312 servicemen and service-

women who have lost their lives in
Afghanistan and Iraq since Sept.
11, 2001.

“It wasn’t until I came here [to

the event] that I understood the
importance of the cause,” Lao said
during the roll call. “To the sol-
diers, thank you so much.”

With her family in mind, Lao
helped pass out yellow ribbons,
which represented support for the

_Armed Forces, to readers as they

ﬁnished their list of names. After
readers received the ribbons, they
placed them on a wreath and wrote
a message to soldiers.

“A lot of these names are people‘
we served with, so we want to pay
homage to them,” Veterans Ben-

eﬁts C'oordinato—r Dennis Renner ‘

said.

Renner spent 24 years in the
Army, stationed in locations across
the world including Germany, Ko-
rea, Iraq and Fort Campbell, Ky.

Six months ago, the Army vet-
eran received an email from Lt. Col.
Brett Morris, Ret., associate direc-
tor of veterans affairs at Eastern
Kentucky University, requesting
that Pitt hold the ceremony.

Morris initiated the Remem-
brance Day Roll Call last year at
Eastern Kentucky, and he decided
to promote the event this year by
sending out a request to colleges

and universities across the na-

tion.

Occupy protests highlight First Amendment issues  

Occupy 4 1

Pennsylvania legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said ofﬁcers “some—
times use more force than necessary.”

Walczak said ﬁghting with the police will
never end in a citizen victory, and police
often follow a “use of force continuum,”
meaning officers will gradually increase
the amount of force used to detain a citizen
in correlation to the amount of resistance
presented by the citizen.

“Politely try to explain to the officer, but

don’t ﬁght on the scene,” Walczak said, ad— _

vising that people adhere to the advice even
if they feel their rights are being violated
by police. In such cases, he urges students
to subsequently relocate to a safe location
and call the ACLU. .

Pittsburgh Bureau of Police spokes-
woman Diane Richard said a police officer
could be dispatched to break up a protest
if criminal activity, such as an assault, is
taking place.‘ She also said officers are given
service training and police have ‘-‘use of force
protocols.” P

Sgt. Eric Kroll from the Training Acad-
emy f'or‘the Pittsburgh Police said officers
undergo ﬁve days of riot control training.

This training includes arrest protocols,‘
formations and the basics of handling a
civil disturbance peacefully. However, when
asked, Kroll declined to provide information
on the tactics used. '
Many condemned the amount of force
used by police during the 2009 G-20 Sum-
mit protests, when Pittsburgh police utilized

a Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD, in’

controlling crowds. This device was origi-
nally developed for use by the military and
produces “harmful, pain-inducing sounds,”
the ACLU website said. It was the ﬁrst time
such a device had been used on U.S. soil
against U.S. citizens. ' ,
_ Riot police also shot OC gas canisters and
rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Many
of the charges against arrested G—20 pro-
testers were for “disorderly conduct” — the
same charges being made against several of
those involved in the Occupy movement.
Under the Pennsylvania, Penal Code,
disorderly conduct occurs when someone
causes a “public inconvenience” by being
reckless, engaging or threatening to engage
in violence, making “unreasonable noise,”
using obscene language or making an ob-

scene gesture, or creating a “hazardous or
physically offensive condition” that serves
no “legitimate purpose.”

Walczak said disorderly conduct is often
considered a “discretionary charge.”

“Police often use that to cite or arrest
people who are doing things they don’t like
or approve of,” Walczak said. “We see disor-
derly conduct misused by police for punish-
ing people for engaging in constitutionally
protected expression.”

Richard encourages citizens to exercise
their First Amendment rights within the
conﬁnes of the law.

“We encourage people to speak — it’s
their right,” Richard said. “Everyone is
granted their First Amendment rights as
long as it is within the law, is peaceful and
orderly.”

Knowing First Amendment Rights

On Oct. 15, the Occupy Pittsburgh pro-

testers held a city-permitted march from V

Freedom Corner at the intersection of Cen-
tre Avenue and Crawford Street to Market
Square Downtown. The march and following
rally lasted for more than four hours and
drew a few thousand protesters.

Pitt law professorjules Lobel said the
government can restrict the time, place and
manner of a protest, as long as it provides
alternative access to the areas requested.
Lobel said the government can. regulate pro-
tests for reasons concerning traffic, noise
and security, but it can’t impose restrictions
based on the content of protests.

.“If you want to march down the street
during rush hour, they can say you can’t,”
Lobel-said. He also said the government

, doesn’t have to grant protesters their spe-

ciﬁc requests, but it must give groups a “rea—
sonable method of demonstration.”

Lobel said the right to assemble only
applies, to public property, and private prop-
e1ty’s availability is up to the discretion of its
owner. But, people can protest on “private
property that takes on a public function or
becomes intertwined with the state.”

The Occupy Pittsburgh group formed a
base on BNY Mellon’s private property on
Oct. 15 following its ﬁrst march and rally,
and has remained there since. Although the
protesters have no constitutional right to be

on the property, BNY Mellon has allowed,

them to stay.

“We are not blocking access,” said BNY
Mellon spokeswoman -Lane Cigna, referring
to the protesters’ current occupation of BNY

Mellon’s property, Mellon Green.

— The First Amendment and the Constitu-
tion are only applied to the government and
its property, so First Amendment rights
are not granted to the protesters on Mel-
lon Green.

Walczak said there are three types of
government property: traditional, which
includes sidewalks, streets and public parks;
non-public forums, such as the inside of
government buildings, and limited public
forums, which are typically non-public areas
that have been opened for civilian discus-
sion, such-as a county council meeting tak-
ing place in a government building.

In order to hold protests on traditional
government property, a group must obtain

' a permit. But Lobel said that some demon-

strations might not need permits. These
demonstrations include small groups of
people gathering on sidewalks to distribute
leaﬂets. But if a group is large enoughto
block trafﬁc, it needs to follow thepermit
procedure, Lobel said.

“If it is a major protest, work with the
authorities and get a permit,” Lobel said,
though he added that, at times, managing

‘to do so is a struggle.

Nadine Brnilovich, special events coor-
dinator at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,
said the price of a permit is around $125,
and_any group planning on using the streets
must have a permit. She said the city rarely

denies permits.

“It’s not often that we’ve denied permits,”

3 Brnilovich said. “We always try to compro-

mise and accommodate to people.”

Walczak said the permit system has be-
come “much fairer” after the ACLU’s 2003
legal dispute People Against Police Vio-
lence v. the City of Pittsburgh. The lawsuit
asserted that “Chapter 603: Parades and
Crowds” of the Code of Ordinances was
“vague and overbroad” and “vests in City
officials’ unbridled discretion to determine
who needs a permit, who gets a permit and
under what conditions.” After the lawsuit,
Chapter 603 was altered. Currently, the
city must approve or deny a permit within
two days. 5 A

Despite any hardships a person or group
might face, Lobel urges students and citi-
zens to defendtheir rights.

“Know your First Amendment rights and
assert them,” Lobel said. “It is an affirma-
tive requirement, an obligation, that public
areas are available for not just transit but

for people to assert their pointsiofpview

 

and protest.”

In the end, ‘it all ‘came down to a

ditch World Cup Sunday evening. The tourna-
ment, in which 93 teams participated, took

Veterans Day roll call a nationwide service project

Veterans < 1

“The goal was to get at least one univer-
sity in each state to participate in the roll
call, and that goal was met,” Renner said.

More than 160 colleges and universities
in all 50 states signed up for the event, and
Pitt was the ﬁrst Pennsylvania school to do
so. California University of Pennsylvania,
Community College of Philadelphia, the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh and Shippensburg
University also participated.

Each of the 150 volunteers at Pitt, who
came and went throughout the day, read
aloud the names of the fallen soldiers, placed
a yellow ribbon on a wire wreath and wrote a
message on a large sign featuring the words,
“Thank you veterans. Rememberi‘ng.those
who served our nation.” A 77‘ , A

One anonymous message read‘, :“All'/‘give
some, but some give all. Gone but not forgot-
ten. Thankyou to all veterans who served
and are currently serving this country.”

The number of volunteers for the roll call
impressed the Ofﬁce of Veterans Services -
even more than it expected.

“We actually had to turn people away
because there were too many volunteers,”
Renner said.

The event even attracted spectators from

outside Pitt.

Emily Ecker and Alyssa Tempus are mem-
bers of AmeriCorps, speciﬁcally the Public
Allies program which trains them to become
better assets to nonproﬁt organizations.

As a service project, the two young wom-
en have decided to focus on veterans ser-

. vices, which led them to the Remembrance

Day National Roll Call.

“We’re here today to listen and learn,”
Ecker said.

Tempus said an event like last Friday’s
not only inspires people, but also teaches
them what kind of veterans services are
already offered and what else needs to be
done.

Outreach coordinatorjanet Owens said , _

Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Veterans Services provides as

much help as it can to veterans so that the.‘ V

transition from military to civilianlife is as

smooth as possible. Witlfi*512_,.veterans on .
campus this year, Pitt’s veteran enrollment ,

has increase by 180 percent since 2009,

one more way that we try our best to honor
and do justice for those who sacriﬁce their
lives.” I ' '

Don’t cancel PSU  
football season 

Needless to say, this has been a
turbulent week for Penn State.

Riots, a media frenzy and abrupt '

changes in administration have
embroiled one of the nation’s

. sleepiest college towns and per-

manentlyv tarnished the reputa-

 tionof an esteemed institution. ’

They’ve also, unsurprisingly,

V prompted certain media outlets

to question thenecessity of_Penn
State’s football season. This past
Thursday, The New York Times
published a virtual roundtable
on whether the team should can-
cel‘ its remaining games. Several
pundits, including the Times’
Gail C¢o’lli‘ns,,' _have”maintaine.d
E  Cove would affirm

  
  

 

egrity:  V T A

However, although we’re dis-
appointed with many Penn State
students’ reactions to this crisis
—— particularly those of the riot-
ers, who decried football head
coach Joe Paterno’s dismissal
while virtually disregardingjerry
Sandusky’s alleged abuses —— we

- don’t think the University should

punish innocent athletes.

Penn State’s Board of Trust-
ees acted remarkably quickly
— some would say hastily —
in dismissing or reprimanding
nearly everyone implicated in
the cover-up. Nevertheless, the
football team has been allowed
to continue playing because,

ﬁrst and foremost, the scandal
has nothing to do with the sport
itself. The same series of events
could have transpired in virtu-
ally any athletic —— or, for that
matter, academic — department.

To cancel the season would -be
to associatela heinous act with a—
sport that in no way facilitated it,
and to eliminate the University’s
only immediate shot at media
redemption. , . 7

In any case, although Pen

State lost to Nebraska this Sat-
urday, the team boasts an im-
pressive 8-2 overall record. Now
more than ever, it’s vital that the
athletes remain at the top of their
games —‘if notlfor the students
who.ig;)vertur_r1ed news vans and

~ destroyed public ‘property last

Wednesday night, then for them-
selves. College football players
have their own public images,
and potential careers, to con-
sider. ‘

This isn’t to say Penn State
football should continue as if
nothing happened. Rather, the
program can demonstrate its
integrity in a variety of ways
— donating the rest of the sea-
sons’ proceeds to Sandusky’s
alleged victims, for example.
Righting past wrongs, not mak-
ing high-minded symbolic ges-
tures, should be the principle
guiding the University’s present
agenda. 

 

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Evaluating the costs and

benefits of your major

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Whenever new job statistics are

released, collegestudents and V

graduates gain one more reason
to be depressed.

Last week, the Wall StreetJour-
nal reported that the unemploy-
ment rate for college graduates aged
24 years and under is 7.7 percent.
Although this is better than the
nationwide 9.1 percent unemploy-
ment rate, it’s still considerable.
Landing a job commensurate with
the qualiﬁcation of a college degree
and with enough earning potential
to justify a crushing amount of debt
is becoming more and more chal-
lenging. This isn’t a good time to
graduate and enter the job market,
but many people my age have no
other choice. V

However, although the employ-
ment prospects look bleak for re-
cent college graduates, there are
serious shortages of particularly
skilled workers in the ﬁelds of sci-
ence and engineering. While some
people frantically comb Craigslist
for a job, many employers are fran-
tically combing the Web to ﬁnd
somebody to pay handsomely.

This underscores avery serious

problem with what people our age
have been told in high school and
before: that college is the key to suc-
cess, and that your major doesn’t re-
ally matter as most people don’t end
up working in their chosen ﬁelds
anyway. Putting these statements
together, it seemed logical that all
college majors were created equal
and that the diploma was the im-
portant thing. The Orwellian real-
ity —— that all majors are equal, but
some are more equal than others
—- was never touched upon. ‘
Choosing a major requires care-

ful consideration of costs and ben-
eﬁts. Costs are not just measured in
money. A cost is essentially what
we have to sacriﬁce in order to do
a particular thing. Every minute I
spend writing this ‘column is a min-
ute not spent hardgaining, playing
Madden, eating $5 pies or reading
the Moustache Column. The cost of
writing this column could be mea-
sured in virtual touchdowns that
would increase my happiness. Simi-
larly, by choosing to be a chemistry
major, I might not have time to go
to football games or the symphony
on the weekends because I have lab
reports to write. The cost of major-
ing in chemistry could be measured
in time spent studying when I would
rather be doing something else.

Mike Rosenthal I Staff Illustrator

On the other side of the equation
are the beneﬁts —— marketability
foremost among them. According
to U.S. Census Bureau statistics,
history majors have an unemploy-
ment rate of 15.1 percent, whereas
actuarial science majors have an un-
employment rate of roughly 0 per-
cent. Of course, as the Wall Street
Journal reported, two-thirds of all
science, technology, engineering
and math majors end up working in
ﬁelds totally unrelated to what they
studied. Yet this doesn’t mean that
their major is irrelevant. Employ-
ers will look at someone with a 3.9
GPA in math and physics and say,
“Wow, this person is really good
at math. Let’s hire him for this
job that requires a lot of ﬁnancial
number crunching..” Similarly,
employers might look at someone
with a 3.9 in the humanities and
say, “Thislperson has to be really
good at writing. Let’s hire him to
read between the lines.” Both these
judgments might be totally unfair
and inaccurate, but it’s important to
remember that what employers see
is extremely limited, and that they
will by necessity weigh things like
choice of major in making a hiring
decision. ‘
Unfortunately, the beneﬁts of
choosing one major over another

Benefits of majors often unknown

were never explained to us. The
costs of some majors — such as two
semesters of organic chemistry ——
are well-known. College students
are asked to conduct cost—beneﬁt
analyses knowing the costs all too
well and the beneﬁts not well at
all. We should not be surprised in
the least that many people choose
less-costly majors that don’t have
as many job prospects.

I am not on a crusade to turn
everybody into a science, math or
engineering major. I am not making
ﬁin of people with an immense pas-
sion for a major they know has little
marketability. Many of these people

are fully aware of the costs and ben-
eﬁts of what they are doing, and
doing something they love might
be the most important beneﬁt to
them. However, I suspect a lot of
people are making decisions about
what major to pursue without full
possession or consideration of the
facts. It should be made clear that
there are both costs and beneﬁts to

picking a certain major, and that the -

job market needs to be taken into
consideration when students select
what to study.

Decreasing number of emergency roms problematic

  

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
‘ Columnist

Did you know there’s an Occupy
Providence? Yeah, neither did I,

and I’m from Rhode Island. It’s

clear that the American people are
hurting ﬁnancially. But before the
movement spreads, there’s arguably
a more pressing problem we should
address: the decreasing number of
emergency rooms.

For everyone, an emergency room is

a stronghold — a beacon of assur-

ance that, no matter what ills befalls

us, at the very least we’ll have access

to a doctor. In 1986, Congress passed
the Emergency Medical Treatment
and Active Labor Act, which requires
participating hospitals to provide
emergency care for anyone, regard-

less of citizenship, ability to pay or
legal status. “Participating” denotes
hospitals receiving payments from
the U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services — in other words,

. virtually every hospital.

Many emergency rooms, however,
are no longer treated as last resorts;
for many Americans, emergency
care is the new primary care. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, annual
emergency room visits increased
from 123.8 million in 2008 to 136
million in 2009. This drastic change
suggests that patients are admitting
themselves for more than typical
emergencies. Not coincidentally, the
Great Recession began in 2008.
Severely compounding this problem
is a decrease in the number of emer-
gency departments. A 2011 study
from the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that
from 1990 to 2009, the number,
of urban hospitals with emergency
departments decreased from 2,446
to 1,779.

Emergency departments that oper-
ated in competitive markets and in

hospitals with meager proﬁt margins

- were more likely to close,’ as were de-

partments in areas with higher—than—
average populations of minorities.
Perhaps this is because these depart-
ments simply couldn’t balance the
books: According to a 2006 report
by The Commonwealth Fund, Afri-
can American and Hispanic adults
were 1.5 to 3 times more likely than
white adults to be uninsured.
American health care is changing, of
course. The Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act — “Obamac—
are” —- was enacted, more than a
year ago, and full measures will take
effect around 2014. Many histori-
cally uninsured groups will become
insured and will thus be able to pay
for hospital visits. But the problem
of decreasing emergency rooms
remains: What’s the use of medical
insurance if there’s no emergency
room in which to use it? Because
many Americans consider the emer-
gency room to be their primary care

facility — whether or not they’re
able to pay — more attention should
be devoted to ensuring that they
don’t close.

If the Obama administration re-
ally wants to improve health care,
it needs to address emergency de-
partment extinction. What Obama-
care does, in effect, is sell tickets to
an already sold-out show. Having
coverage is ﬁne, but being forced
to deprive your child of needed
primary care because the next ER
is too far away is pitiful. Moreover,
more insured Americans means the
already limited number of primary-
care doctors will be harder to reach.
Thus, some people might just use the
ER for convenience, which is more
costly than a primary care visit.‘
We experienced our own emergency-
department closure recently: West
Penn Hospital in Bloomﬁeld termi-
nated its department late last year
after reporting a $90 million loss.
Fortunately, this will be ,reversed.,,__,

West Penn Allegheny Health System
and insurance company Highmark
just developed a merger, and they
have a plan that includes the re-
opening of West Penn’s emergency
department next year. We’re one of
the lucky few.

American use the ER for non—urgent
situations is not ideal, but it’s real-
ity. And our legislation and future
plans should reflect that reality; If
our goal is to insure everyone, then

we should provide enough facilities a

to offer them care. ,
It comes down to quantity versus

‘ efﬁciency _— the current health

care facilities cannot handle the
large quantity of people, and so ef-
ﬁciency is lost.

We will likelyvsee an Occupy Squir-
rel Hill before we see the number
of emergency departments drasti-
cally increase. I just hope someone
is spreadingthe word about the
crisis, and that it’s on a congress-

I man’s- mind. I

Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Pitt women’s basketball head coach Agnus
Berenato said Saturday that it wasn’t a na-

_ -tional powerhouse like Connecticut or Notre
Dame that gave the Panthers their most
resounding loss in years.

It was the Hampton Lady Pirates.

A nearly-12-minute ﬁrst—half ﬁeld goal
drought did the Panthers in Saturday after-
noon, and Hampton defeated Pitt 60-37 at
the Petersen Events Center in both teams’
season opener.

“I said to my staff, ‘I haven’t had a butt-
kicking like that in a really long time,”’
Berenato said. “We’ve played Connecticut
and Notre Dame and a lot of really good

<,..teams, and I think that today our youth

really showed.”

Hampton senior guard Choicetta Mc-
Millian hit six 3-pointers en route to 22
points and eight rebounds, and the Lady
Pirates (1-0) showed why they dominated
the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference last
season. Hampton hit 10 three—pointers,
out-rebounded Pitt 46-35 and frustrated
the Panthers offense.

“I wouldn’t say I expected to come in here
and hit as many threes, but I would be lying
to you if I said that we didn’t come in here

wand expect to win,” Hampton head coach
David Six said. “We had a philosophy that
if we defend at a high level, if we rebound
well and we don’t turn the ball over, we can
play with anybody.” , A

Hampton is the two—time defending
MEAC champion.

Pitt (0-1) held strong early against the
Lady Pirates, limiting the effectiveness of
senior frontcourt duo Melanie Warner and
Sherena Abercrumbia in the opening 10
minutes.

“I thought we got off to a rocky start,
obviously,” Six said. “It’s early in the season
and people are still ﬁnding their way.”

Hampton started 5 for 22 from the
ﬂoon

But Pitt’s struggles on offense marred

Brianna Kiesel hit a jumper with 11:47 left
in the ﬁrst half, Pitt didn’t make another
ﬁeld goal until sophomore forward Asia
Logan converted a fast—break layup at the
buzzer.

By then, Hampton’s perimeter shooting
had given the Lady Pirates a 31-15 advan-
tage.

“We need to relax and run our plays,”
Logan said after the game. “The points are
there. We were just rushing.” »

In the ﬁrst half, the Panthers recorded
11 turnovers, one assist, 3 for 10 from the
free—throw stripe and 0 for 4 from 3-point
range.

Berenato said that her young players re-
ceived a dose of reality against Hampton.

“I think that, mentally, it was really obvi-
ous we had a young team today,” she said.
“They would miss a shot and put their head
down, or a coach would say something to
them and because of inexperience and not
being seasoned and mature, they would
take it personally.”

With six freshmen, three sophomores
and three redshirt sophomores, Pitt is the
youngest team in Division I women’s bas-
ketball this year.

“I think that our players don’t know ex-
actly what kind of effort we expect from
them because they’ve never played an en-
tire college season before,” Berenato said.

“Normally young players would experience _

coming in as a substitute and playing a few
minutes and even going some games not
playing at all, but right now all of our play-
ers have to play 20 to 30 minutes since they
are all new.”

The Panthers also had to deal with a
growing list of injuries against Hampton.
Freshman forward TiAnna Porter missed
Saturday’s game and will miss about a month
because of a stress fracture in her foot, Be-
renato said. ‘ -

Porter joins fellow freshmen Cora Mc-
Manus and Loliya Briggs on the injury list,
leaving Pitt with just nine healthy players
and three healthy forwards.

Berenato moved Logan, a natural guard,
to power forward against Hampton.

Logan ﬁnished with a team-high 12
points, the only Panther scorer in double
digits. V
Sophomore center Leeza Burdgess had
10 rebounds, but Hampton pulled down 16
offensive boards over Pitt’s frontcourt.

we weren’t able to accomplish that today.”

couldn’t close the gap to any fewer than

Pitt seals win

were forcedto send Pittto the foul line in an effort
to make a late comeback.

“There are no 6k-point plays,” Gibbs said. “We

just have to take it one shot at a time.”

The Broncs fell to Robert Morris 83~57 in

their season opener on Friday, giving many the '

impression that the Panthers would easily coast
to avictory. I

But Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said he knew
thatRiderwas betterthan its perforrnanceagalnst
the Colonials.

Rider head coach Tommy Dempsey said that
he knew it, too. “I told our guys [before the Pitt

game] there.is no such thing as a moral victory,”

he said. “We were embarrassed by how we played

on Friday  We didfall short ofthe goal, but I was

pleased ofthe effort.” A '
Afterthe Panthers jumped outto their 14-point

ﬁrst—halflead, Rider took off on a 13-2 rim that_ _

trimmed Pitfsadvantage to 32-29 with 6:47 left
inthehalf. “They came out and they made shots 
they playedalot more eflicient, and theyhavealot

“I think the reason we were so successﬁil in
the points of the paint category was that we were
able to take it around [their ﬁontcourt] instead of

, trying to go through,” Dempsey said.

He said the Broncs came into the game want-

 ing to use their big ‘men. to draw Pitt’s ﬁontcourt

to the perimeter. ,
Robinson — who ﬁnished with 22 points and

,2 six rebounds — said he tried to play smart and

Myles scoreda game-high 20 points, while Stewart

Dixon said the Panthers have plenty of work
to do, particularly defensively. “This better not

be our best, let’s put it that way. And I’m sure it’s

not,” he saidl
