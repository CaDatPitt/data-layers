SGB to meetin
Nordy’s Place

Carla Trinca-Conley
Staff Writer

StudentGovemmentBoardannounced
achangeinlocationofitsweeklymeet-
ings last night.

The Board, hoping to increase

transparency and make it easier for .

students to attend meetings, will con-
vene in Nordy’s Place for meetings
startingMarch 2.

Board President Charlie Shull said
seats will include room for the Board
members and aboutzo seatsfor mem-
bers ofthe studentbody. Iftherewerea
largeamountofallocations requests for
the week, Shull said he would increase
seating space.

“If one student stays in Nordy’s
Place forthe meeting, or if one student
walks past that meeting and walks in
and learns a little bit about Student
Government Board, that’s success to
me,” Shull said.

Iforder cannot be kept from stu-

dents playing pool or watching sport-
ing events, the Board will move meet-
ings back to its‘ original location, Shull
said.

Shull also asked students to par-_

ticipate in Pitt Day in Harrisburg, dur-
ingwhich students travel to the state’s
capital to lobby for funding.

The goal is to have 55 students —
oneﬁillbus ——traveltoHarrisburgand

talk with legislators about receiving, V

money for the University, he said.

The Universityis classiﬁedas state-
aﬁiliated and receives a portion of its
money from appropriations in Har-
risburg.

State-related schools receive a por-
tion of their revenue from the com-
monwealth.

The other state schools that receive
this revenue are Temple, Penn State
and Lincoln. Over the past few years,
the state decreased its ﬁmdingto state-
related universities -——which Shull said
has subsequently raisedtuition rates to
compensate for the missing revenue.

come to Pitt, show their attachmentto the school
and explainwhat Pitt provides for them, the com-

more of a investment, Shull said.

“We, as students, needthis money,” and with-
out this money, tuitionwill increase, he said.

SGB also announced its new committee chairs

Toyota failures:
iota to big auto?

en Toyota’s worldwide car
and truck sales surpassed
General Motor’s sales in

2007, the company effectively outdid
the world leader in auto sales for 76
years. But now with the faulty brake
and gas pedals and other mechani-
cal maladies in some of its models,
Toyota has itselfbecome a dethroned
king.

Since November, Toyota has re-
called more than 8 million vehicles,
according to CNN. Between 2000 and
2009 the National Highway Trafﬁc
Safety Administration received atotal
of 34 complaints alleging fatalities
regarding Toyota vehicles. The re-
call gained momentum in late Janu-
ary when the accelerators in certain
Toyotas began to be suspected as the
culprits behind crashes. Since Toyota
began its recall, buyer complaints
have increased.

It’s unfortunate for car buyers
everywhere that Toyota has proven
unreliable with some of its models
and that it had to issue such a wide-
spread recall. Our society is still
very car-driven, and drivers need a
brand they can trust. When Toyota
led theworld in sales, it couldn’t have
done so without a solid reputation
among consumers. Now even those
who didn’t own a Toyota ﬁrsthand
will have reason to be skeptical of its
models.

Before all the commotion over
Toyota’s recalled vehicles, the models

_ had a consistent and strong reputa-

tion among most buyers. CNN re-
ported that Edn1unds.com examined
more than200,00o complaints about
automobiles ﬁled with the NHTSA
and found that Toyota ranked 17th
among the top 20 automakers in the
number of complaints for each ve-
hicle sold.

This car crisis wouldn’t have such
an impact on the typical American
driver if U.S. auto companies hadn’t
so recently found themselves in
such disarray. Now that Toyota has
faltered, American drivers can’t
necessarily fall back on American
companies because of the compa-
nies’ still-botched reputations. In
May of last year, auto-giant General
Motors told 1,100 dealers across the
country that it would be severing its
connection with them. That ﬁgure
represents about one-ﬁfth of the total
number of dealers in the U.S. Around
this time, Chrysler said it would close
1,900 —— about one-fourth —-— of its
dealerships in the United States. The
American auto companies promise
a big turnaround, but they’ve seen
enough recent hardship that they still
have real obstacles to overcome and
customers to potentially win back.

Still, with a blemish to Toyota’s
image, American auto companies
could beneﬁt from the blow to the
competition. With an industry that’s
as diverse and competitive as the auto
industry, there are bound to be at
least some customers who will turn
away from Toyota and buy American-
brand vehicles. Of course, there’s a
litany of othermakers to choosefrom
— ones that might not have been as
large-scale sellers as Toyota and GM,
but ones that haven’t necessarily had
marred reputations either.

It remains to be seen what the
long-term effects of the recalls will
be for Toyota. It already halted sales
on eight models because of safety
concerns at the end of January and
recently halted some vehicle produc-
tion. Short-term sales will decline,
but given its previous reputation,
whether the effect will be lasﬁng re-
mains to be seen.

Private snow patrols

answer to city’s woes?

City of Pittsburgh ineffectively handled record snowfalls, repeats mistake

 
 
  

Giles Howard
Columnist

The city’s response to last week’s
snowstorm illustrated that govern-
ment is better suited to making
regulations and collecting tax dol-
lars than it is to providing services.
Although it’s important to praise
the employees of the Departments
of Public Works and Public Safe-
ty for their admirable efforts, it
should be recognized that city poli-
ticians failed once again to prepare
Pittsburgh for a major snowfall.
For instance, Pittsburgh’s road
salt budget for 2010 is $559,640
—— down $400,000 from last year.
This drastic cut in the road salt
budget might seem like a small is-
sue to some readers, but it is indic-
ative of how government priorities

differ from taxpayer priorities.
Importantly, the road salt
spending wasn’t reduced as part
of an across-the-board budget re-
duction. City revenue for 2010 in-

creased by more than $5.6 million ~
and city expenditures increased by '

almost $10 million, so we know
that the cut in road salt spending
wasn’t brought about by a ﬁscal
crisis. -

Indeed, the budget of the De-
partment of Public Works Bureau
of Operations — the bureau re-
sponsible for snow removal and
road salt purchasing — is the only
division of Public Works to have its
budget cut this year.

‘If you listened to city politi-
cians, though, you’d never guess
that the road saltbudget was cut as
government officials consistently
promise that they will do better at
snow removal in ﬁxture years. For

instance, after the city failed in the
cleanup of another major February
storm in 2008, Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl declared a “War on Snow”
and promised to do everything
possible to “make sure the city
does a better job keeping streets
free of snow and ice,” the Pitts-
burgh Post- Gazette reported.
Fast forward to last week and
the Mayor admitted that the city
didn’t have enough resources to
clear Pittsburgh streets just as he
issued a call for private contractors
to contact the city if they could
help in the snow removal effort.
In criticizing the city’s response
to the snowstorm and the evi-
dent discrepancies between what
politicians say when people are
looking and how they construct
a budget when people are not, it’s
important to recognize the work
of Public Works employees who

Private firms worth a try given city's inability

Howard < 6

did their best during the storm.
These employees pulled 12-hour
shifts to clear city streets, but they
were betrayed by a city govern-
ment that doesn’t have its priori-
ties straight. -

The response to the storm and
the conﬂictbetween the priorities
of politicians and those of the peo-
ple demonstrates that we would do
well to pay private ﬁrms to provide
us with those services we previ-
ously thought of as necessarily
governmental in scope. It would
cost residents a great deal less to
contract with a private ﬁrm to re-

move snow than it costs in taxes
to the city, because such a private
ﬁrm wouldn’t spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars on a diversity
commission.

I also suspect that no private
ﬁrm would employ individuals like
Shawn Beck, union steward for the
American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees
Local 2719, who complained during
the storm that city meter readers
were being asked to shovel snow
around city garages without “the
training that they need to be shown
how to properly shovel snow,” he

told the Post-Gazette.
The logistics of private ﬁrms
being hired by individuals or

neighborhoods to plow streets
would have to be ﬁgured out, but
delegating snow removal to pri-

66

Such a private ﬁrm wouldn’t spend
.' hundreds of thousands of dollars on a
diversity commission.

vate businesses is at least worth a
shot in light of the city’s absolute
inability to cope with snowfall. A
private solution to snow removal
would have the added beneﬁt of al-
lowing private citizens to set their
own priorities and determine how
their money is spent — thus giving
Pittsburghers control over a pro-
cess that government consistently
fails to execute efﬁciently.

Rulesof coinage: word formation basics

As a sea of new words floods modern culture, we should avoid aspirating the water of untamed syllables.

 
  
 

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

The English language is constantly
evolving, whether it’s through the
inclusion of slang or the expansion
of the Oxford English Dictionary.
For us young, hip college students,
those changes are often a result of
our weekend antics and late—night
conversations.

There are quite a few reasons for
inventing new words: avoiding -
or enhancing —— the use of swears,
leavingyour mark on the language or
just plain sounding cool. However; we
have to understand that the successful
inventor of new words carries quite a
bit of power.

As a result of that, we can’t be too
reckless with our verbal crafts. For
your convenience, I’ve outlined a set
of practical and important rules that
one should follow when coining new

phrases.
First, it’s important that new

words fulﬁll one of the required rea-.

sons. Like any new products that hit
the market, these words need to be
original and hip. They should  pleas-
ant to the ear and easy to pronounce.
Also make sure to include letters like
“z” and “x”, while removing “g’ ’ from
the end of active verbs. Including in-
frequently used letters will give your
words a unique style, while cutting
off “g’s” will help make them sound
less harsh.

Next, use the word as much as
possible. Ifit’s going to get picked up
by friends and family, it needs to be
heard. The point is to have people stop
you on the street and ask, “Hey! What
does that mean?”

Finally, any word thathasfound its
way into our vocabulary will undoubt-

edly undergo variations in usage and _

pronunciaﬁon. When alteringyour or
others’ words, it is imperative that you
respect the integrity of the original

form, both in meaning and sound.

On the off chance thatyou’ve read
this far down, you’ve probably been
conﬁised asto the applicability of the
above rules. For your word-creating
pleasure, I’ll provide an in-depth case
study so that you can begin your lin-
guistic adventures properly and with
the greatest chance for widespread
recognition.

About halfway through my ﬁrst
semester, I went on a road trip to
Philadelphia with my fraternity broth-
ers and found myself immersed’ in a
sea 0 “jawns” and “wudders.” For
those not up on the lingo, jawns can
mean anything and everything — an
alternate to “thing.” Wudder is just
the way Philadelphians pronounce
water— it’s asimple, but sometimes

confusing, difference.

Despite my general aversion to
Philly slang, I did fall in love with the
tri-state invention of “bunz.” Take the
deﬁnition I’ve compiled.

Bunz I bunz I (adj) — disagreeable

or unpleasant because socially un-
acceptable; eating the whole box of
Oreos when you were only offered
one is bunz.

Let’s see how bunz stacks up
against our rules. First, it is pleasing
to the ear while also a means of ex-
pressing distaste without having to
revert to other four—letterwords. Hip
and useful. Check.

Second, in the past few months,
I’ve done my best to make sure bunz
has invaded every aspect of my real
and digital life. Facebook, 'I‘witter,
Gmail, carrier pigeon. Check.

Before we ﬁnish, let’s examine
some changes that have been im-
parted on bunz: bunzin, bunzatron,
and bunzalicious. Here we have two
acceptable and one improper varia-
tion on the original word.

Bunzin, the act ofbeingbunz, sim-
ply takes the word from an adjective
to a verb. Bunzatron, a very creative
alteration, denotes someone or some-
thing that is so bunz that the doer is

a machine that specializes in bunzin.
Both words carry the original mean-
ingwhile extending its use. Therefore,
they’re acceptable.

As expected, though, therewillbe
certain derivatives that sully the sin-
cerity and integrity of the root word.
Bunzalicious is neither creative nor
true to the gospel of bunz. “Licious,”
which can be traced to bootylicious,
implies a certain pleasantness that
undermines the proper use of bunz.
Thus, bunzalicious is unacceptable 
and also quite bunz in and of itself.

By this point, you’ve hopefully
started concocting your own new
words while still being conscious
of their manufacture and modiﬁca-
tion. Shakespeare invented and made
popular innumerable words — like
“assassination” and “obscene” —-that
have passed into our daily usage and
I believe we’ve all got a little bit of his
magic in us. Let’s ﬁnd it.

ANALYSIS

Fashion Week offers surprises

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

It’s New York Fashion Week,
ladies and gentleman — which
means the fashion world’s glit—
terati (redundant?) have congre-
gated in New York for eight crazy
days and nights to celebrate and
preview the completion of the
Fall/Winter 2010 lines. Tomor-
row the festivities will end, and
legions of editors willjump on a
plane and head over to England
for London Fashion Week. It’s a

rough life, keeping up with all
this fashion, but somebody’s got
to do it.

Attempting to summarize ev-
erything that’s happened thus far
at New York Fashion Week in this
modest corner of The Pitt News
is essentially an impossible task,
but sometimes a girl has to put
on her lipstick and try, right? So
here we go, my top 10 of Fashion
Week 2010.

1. Alexander McQueen, R.I.P.:
In one of the most tragic starts to
NYFW possibly ever, Alexander
McQueen, maker of all the things

elegantly edgy, was found dead in
his home last Thursday. Reports
say it was suicide. Why is it that
the most brilliant minds are also
the most tortured? McQueen, you
are a legend and will be forever
missed.

2. Relocation, relocation, relo-
cation: Sadly, this will be the last
year the Fashion Week tents will
be pitched in Bryant Park. Start-
ing in December, the shows will
venture over to Lincoln Center.
I guess the designers on “Proj—
ect Runway” can’t repeat, “I just
want to make it to Bryant Park”

back.

“I do my work from the driv-
er’s seat,” he said.

Grave Digger and eight other
trucks are set to destroy, enter-
tain and captivate in Monster
Jam at Mellon Arena this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

anymore. “I just want to make it
to Lincoln Center” doesn’t have
quite the same ring to it.

3. Who invited you?: Gen-
erally, Fashion Week is for the
editorial elite and die—hard fans
of fashion. This year, however, a
new demographic attempted to
slip its way past the velvet ropes.
Everyone’s favorite pop cultural
phenomenon (but really, aren’t
they a little two months ago?),
the cast of the Jersey Shore, was
rumored to have requested fash-
ion show tickets. Newsflash, my
Seaside Heights darlings, unless

Carolina Herrera decides that
Bumpits are the next vision of
elegance, you aren’t getting in
anywhere that matters.

4. Beyond the clothes: Anyone
who’s managed to catch an epi-
sode of “Kell on Earth,” Bravo’s
brilliant new series about fashion
public relations mogul Kelly Cu-
trone, knows that it takes a whole
lot more than clothes to make a
fashion show work. The presen-
tations have to create an atmo-
sphere —— the lights, the runway,
the goodie bags — all have to be
on—point. One of the week’s big

production winners for me was Erin Was-
son x RVCA, who showed in a carpet and
furniture store. The models were serenad-
ed by a live performance from Yeasayer,
whose quirky international-tinged sounds
were the perfect pairing for Wasson’s hip
beret—topped T-shirt and legging looks.
If you haven’t listened to Yeasayer, and
you’re looking for something new, I highly
recommend checking out their new album
appropriately titled Odd Blood.

5. Velvet Revolver: Fashionista blog-
ger Britt Aboutaleb wrote “A Rant on the
Proliferation of Velvet” yesterday and I
couldn’t agree more. Velvet, unfortunately,
has become one of the runaway trends of
Fall 2010. Now, I haven’t worn the stuff
since’ my days of Tuesday night cotillion
back in middle school, and I hadn’t really
planned on purchasing any swathes of the
unﬂattering fabric anytime soon. Abouta-
leb says the fabric “looks cheap —— and I
don’t mean inexpensive,” and I’m right
there with her. While I frequently have
a softening toward trends I hate in the
beginning, I’m not sure if my opinion will
budge on this one.

6. Fashionably early: Perhaps the most ’

shocking move of NYFW was Marc Jacobs’
show starting ﬁve minutes early. Known

for sending his models down the runway
up to two hours late, Marc pulled it to-
gether and got things going in record time.
There was a slew of fur-trimmed coats,
a penchant for cutouts and a shimmery
cardigan that I absolutely must have.

choices, showing cropped blazers over
corsets and velvet boots. While the risk
factor is admirable, his best strides were
when he stuck to monochromatic knits
and leather pieces.

8. Haiti Relief: Because the fashion

I guess the designers on ‘Project’Runway’ can’t
repeat, ‘I just want to make it to Bryant Park’

anymore.

7. Alexander Wang: If you’ve ever worn
an oversized grey T-shirt, torn jeans and
alblack beanie, you have Alexander Wang
to thank. The designer revolutionized ca-
sual-hipster-"cool, but this season he did

something a little different. To largely _

mixed reviews, Wang debuted a line of
uncharacteristically buttoned-up suit fab-
rics. He made some peculiar proportion

Trucks ‘dig g

Monster truck < 8

couldn’t get parts or service for his F-250
4x4 pickup truck.

Chandler used the truck for work but
also took it off-roading for fun. Eventually,
he had the idea to use large agricultural
tires, lifting the truck high into the air.

While that truck was only used to car-
ry the ﬂag during the national anthem of
truck and tractor pulls, it wasn’t until 1981
that Chandler wanted to see if his truck
could drive over several junk cars lined
up in a row.

Thus was born Bigfoot —-'— and with it
the monster truck phenomenon. _

Huffaker, a driver for one of the seven
Grave Diggers touring the world, has been
helming Grave Digger for 17 years but driv-
ing monster trucks for 28. *

“I’ve done it since the beginning of the
sport,” he said. .

Dennis Anderson of Poplar Branch,
N.C., created the first Grave Digger in
1981 from a 1952 Ford pickup and a Chevy
engine- i

“People would come up to him and ask,
‘What are you gonna do with that thing?’
And he would say, ‘I’m gonna dig your guy
graves in it,’” Anderson said. '

Anderson then took the truck to a cus- i

tom painter, asking for an eerie paint job,
and christenedthe truck, Grave Digger.

Jim Koehler, from Columbus, Mich.,
started his own monster truck career back
in the late 1980s. He now drives the green
and yellow ﬁery truck, Avenger, .the name
originating from his father’s old 1960s
drag car. After witnessing monster trucks
in his hometown in northern Michigan,
Koehler and his buddies imagined the ex-
citement of having their own truck.

Koehler then started researching mon-
ster trucks and looking into the speciﬁca-
tions of trucks he liked, and took pictures
to get his own ideas. _

“I just tried to take the best of every-
body’s stuff and put it all together,” Koehler
said. “It was more like a labor of love, a
project—type thing. I never expected for it
to become a career. I expected just to show
it off to have a cool, big giant truck.”

But what’s so cool about having a gi- .

ant truck? While Huffaker sees getting

into one as part of his everyday routine, 7

Koehler still gets excited every time he
drives his truck.

“It’s all the amusement park rides
wrapped up in one. It’s the best park and
you’re in control of the rides,” Koehler
said.

Of course, with the multiplication of ,

size comes the multiplication of danger.

‘ “You used to get beat up, you’d be sore
with bruises,” he said. “Safety’s come a
long way, though. Monster trucks have the
illusion‘~of being totally unsafe and uncon-
trollable, but the safety is there.”

Despite the fact that harnesses, neck
collars, helmets and specialized safety-
foam seats, which handle the g—force of
landings, are only a few of the innovative
safety features of the modern monster
truck, Koehler still sees the experience as
a wild illusion of insanity.

“It’s controlled chaos,” he said.

::niors leave, softball team ready

‘ The Pitt softball team prepares for its set of 5 spring season tournaments, the first of which to take place on Friday.

Chris Neverman I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER '

Head coach Holly Aprile calls Alyssa O’Connell, who had a 2.79 ERA

last season, a “team leader.”

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt softball team doesn’t open at
home until March 24, when the Pan-
thers will face Youngstown State, but
that isn’t keeping the team from stay-
ing busy early in the spring season.
The Panthers will play in ﬁve tour-
naments this spring, starting on Feb.

19, at the FloridaAtlantic Invitational 1

in Boca Raton.

The Panthers return all but two
players from the team that ﬁnished
25-24 overall and 9-15 in conference
play last season. Amongthe departed

- seniors is catcher Sam Card.

“She pretty much started every
game at catcher,” head coach Holly

Aprile said. “It’s hard to replace her ‘

leadership and offensive production.
Losing a seasoned, full-time starter
and signiﬁcant offensive contributor
like Sam Card is never easy.”

Card batted .277 for Pitt last sea-
son, while leading the team with 28
RBIs. '

Still, Aprile said that sophomore
Keli Gaynor and ﬁleshman-Holly Ste-
vens are up to the challenge of ﬁlling
Card’s void.

“Holly will probably be seeing
time behind the plate as a starter,”
Aprile said. “She’ll split time, but she’s

the one freshman who will really be
playing-”

Aprile said both Stevens and
Gaynor will catch, and she expects
Stevens to produce solid offensive
numbers for the team. S

Stevens, a California native, was
the 2009 Los Angeles city player of
the year. Gaynor was a three-time
all—conference and all-group honoree
at Eastern Regional'High School in
Newjersey.

The other senior missing from
this season’s Panthers squad is pitch-
er Kaitlyn Schuster.

“She didn’t see a ton of innings,
but she was one of our captains last
year,” Aprile said. “Her presence will
be missed.”

The Panthers return the rest of
their pitching rotationfrom last sea-
son: Alyssa O’Connell,Cory Berliner
and Kayla Zinger.

“We will continue to be strong
on the mound,” Aprile said. “Alyssa
worked very hard in the offseason

‘ and I expect her to really come into

her own this year. She is a very hard
worker and a-team leader.”
0’Connell threw 89 innings last
season, with an ERA of 2.59. Berliner
led the pitching staff with 134.1 in.-

‘ nings and a 1.72 ERA.

Center ﬁelder Reba 'I‘utt is Pitt’s

top returning starter on the offen-
sive side, and according to Aprile she
has also stepped up her game defen-
sively. Tutt batted .279 to lead the
Panthers last season, while driving
in 21 runs. 7

“She has always been a serious
competitor, but she has been no-
ticeably more aggressive in the out—_
ﬁeld and her dedication sets a great
example to the rest of the team,”

Aprile said. “She arrives early and ‘

stays late.” - .

Aprile expects left ﬁelder Ashley
Amistade to be a “table setter” at
the plate and provide an offensive
spark for the Panthers. Aprile said
Amistade showed great improvement
throughout the year.

Right ﬁelder Yvette Bravo returns
to the team after leading Pitt with six
home runs last season. ‘

“I expect Yvette to really make her
presence felt at the plate this year
and to produce strong numbers for
us with the long ball and RBI totals,”
Aprile said. ’

Pitt also returns its entire inﬁeld

‘ from last season, includingthe strong

defensive combination of shortstop
Niki Cognigni and second baseman
Kristin Cheesebrew — a core that
Aprile said is “working well togeth-
er.”

Panthers seek second Big East Win tonight

Pitt and Villanova will both vie for another conference win when they face off in the Wildcats’ Pavilion at 7 p.m.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team

_ earned its ﬁrst Big East home vic-

tory on Sunday and looks to pick up
its third conference win at Villanova
tonight.

” The Panthers’ 72-69 victory over
Louisville featured the emergence of

role player Brittaney Thomas, who
scored a career-high 22 points in the
victory. S

For the Panthers to grab consecu-
tive Big East wins for the ﬁrst time
in 2010, they will need Thomas and
other players to take a lesson from
the Louisville game and continue to
step up down the stretch. » 1 —

“Ourcomfort zonewasbeingclose
and not just quite getting there, but

we got it done today,” Pitt head coach
Agnus Berenato said after the victory
over the Cardinals.

After the Georgetown loss on Feb.
10, Berenato said she started calling
the sets in order to alleviate pressure
on any one particular player during
C1'LlI1Cl.'l time.

“Win or lose, we [the coaches] take
the responsibility,” Berenato said. “I
feel like that took a lot of pressure off

everyone.”

Astime wound down against Lou-
isville, the Panthers felt like they were
going to win, Berenato said.

LIT|'MAN TEST

Hacking’s fine if you can win the Tour, right?

In the spirit of Olympic ethnocentrism, there ’s no question we should support Floyd Landis despite the mounting evidence.

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

The Olympics are great for one reason:
feigned ethnocentricity.

We can put aside all our differences for
two weeks while a small group of people
shows the rest of the world why our country
is better than them at a number of sporting
events that all require extremely speciﬁc
skill sets.

For those two weeks every two years, we
care about sports we don’t normally consider
sports. We turn all our attention to Lindsey
Vonn’s shin, Apolo Ono’s soul patch and Bode
Miller’s blood alcohol content.

This Olympic season, however, the Amer-
ican athlete most in need of our support isn’t
in Vancouver. No, he’s on the lam. .

Okay, maybe not on the lam, but still.
America, remember Floyd Landis?

Landis is an American cyclist most fa-
mous for winning the 2006 Tour de France

only to have his title stripped after a lab
tested his urine and found abnormally high
testosterone levels. He became the ﬁrst man
since the race started in 1903 to have a win
taken away from him. Although Landis de-
nied ever doping — and maintains that posi-
tion still — the win was awarded to Spain’s
Oscar Pereiro.

Now, using performance enhancers isn’t
something foreign to cycling. It’s widely con-
sidered to have the most doping of any sport
in the world. Cycling does fall to second if
you were to imagine the ﬁctional sport of
Steroiditarod, an underground race in Alaska
where men get all hopped up on steroids and
pull sleds carrying dogs — also on steroids
— across the state. 2

On Monday, Reuters reported that a
French judge issued an arrest warrant for
Landis for “suspected hacking into an anti-
doping laboratory computer,” according
to French anti—doping agency head Pierre
Bordry.

Cognigni and Cheesebrew boasted ﬁelding
percentages of .881 and .966, respectively, last
season.

Ciera Damonwill play ﬁrst base for the Pan-
thers, while Megan Livesey andjess Rhodunda

Morehead State Invitational, followed by the
USF Under Armour Invitational in Clearwater,
Fla.

We will continue to be strong on the mound.

Holly Aprile

will split time at third base. Damon will spend
the majority of time at ﬁrst base after making
the switch from third base last season.

“She’s looked like an old pro in preseason
practices,” Aprile said of Damon.

After its ﬁrst tournament in Florida, Pitt
travels to Chapel Hill for the North Carolina
Invitational on Feb. 27.

Less than a week later, the Panthers will

tational in Harrisonburg, Va. That tournament

is set to end on March 21, giving the team just
enough time to return to Pennsylvania for its
home opener.

The Panthers started practices on Jan. 11
with a week of individuals. Full team practices
picked up the week ofjan 18, around four weeks
before the Panthers leave for their ﬁrst tourna-
ment, which begins on Feb. 19.

Panthers will apply
lessons from Sunday

Villanova < 12

Georgetown.
Versus Syracuse and Georgetown, mistakes

’ and hesitance down'the stretch cost the Pan-

thers two victories. Against Syracuse, Berenato
said the team played passively toward the end

of the game, holding the ball for too long and -

not capitalizing on opportunities to score. On
the last possession of the Georgetown game,
a dismantled play forced Sims to take an off-
balance three.

However, down the stretch against Louis-
ville, Pitt found its way to the winner’s column
because several Panthers looked like they
wanted the ball in their hands — none more
so than Thomas.

With six games remaining on its schedule,
Pitt has the chance to ﬁnish 18-11 overall and
8-9 in BigEastplay heading into the conference
tournament.

’ To do that, the Panthers will need players to
take a cue from Thomas and step up in critical
moments.

If the team does that, a string of season-
ending victories, success in the Big East tour-
nament and maybe even a NCAA tournament
berth might not be out of reach.

First, however, the Panthers must knock off
Villanova, ateam desperate forasecond Big East
victory of its own. I

The Wildcats notched their ﬁrst conference
victory on Feb. 9, defeating Syracuse 83-69.

‘However, Villanova was unable to follow up

that win with a second, falling 49 -36 in its last
game against Rutgers.

Villanova struggled offensively against the
Scarlet Knights, shooting 30 percent for the
game with only one player reaching double
ﬁgures.

While Maria Getty scored 12 points, no other
player on the team scored more than seven.

Getty leads the Wildcats in scoring for the
season with 11.5 points per game, with Laura
Sweeney the only othervillanova player averag-
ing double ﬁgures with 10.2 points per game.

Getty, a senior guard, is a threat from be-
yond the arc and a standout defender. She is
13th in the Big East from three, shooting 36.6
percent.

A 6—foot-2 forward, redshirt freshman
Sweeney is a solid rebounder. She can score
inside and out, attempting 22 three—pointers
so far this season.

Sweeney shoots almost 55 percent from the
ﬁeld, ranking sixth in the conference and lead-
ing the Wildcats in rebounds with 5.5 boards
per game.

The Pitt-Villanova game will tipoff at 7
p.m.

Cyclist might have hacked, but it’s OK

. Littman (13

to prove his innocence, which was a failed
effort that led to his banning from the sport
for two years. According to The Los Angeles
Times, French judge Thomas Cassuto wants
to question Landis about the allegedly stolen
’ computer data from the anti-drug laboratory
outside Paris that tested Landis. Bordry said
the arrest warrant was issued Jan. 28, after
Landis failed to show up in November on
Cassuto’s summons.
Reuters also reported that the judge put

Dear Oakland Zoo,

out a warrant for Arnie Baker, Landis’ for-
mer coach. Back in May of last year, French
newspaper Le Monde reported that a French
cyber crime investigation team linked the
documents to a computer supposedly reg-
istered to Baker.

After he was stripped of his title, Landis
brought his case to the Court of Arbitration
for Sport claiming the lab mishandled his
sample, but the case was thrown out the
next year.

“It seems that [Landis] made all he could
to enter into our computer system to try to
prove the laboratory was wrong. He showed
many documents he got by hacking to nu-
merous sporting instances,” Bordry told
Reuters. “The judge traced a network of
hackers back to the ringleader.”

As of Monday, though, Landis said he
hasn’t been served a warrant, but wasn’t
sure about his former coach.

“I can’t speak for Arnie, but no attempt

reason you are such a huge success is the positive manner in which you handle

like to say thank you and keep up the great work. On a personal note I would also like

to thank you for your support with the “Heart Health”

program. Your show of support
the best student section in  

has been made to formally contact me,” Lan-
dis said in an e—mail to the Times. “It appears
to be another case of fabricated evidence by
a French lab who is still upset a United States
citizen believed he should have the right to
face his accusers and defend himself.”

Boom!

If you’re getting ready to light a crois-
sant on ﬁre only to put it out with that foul-
tasting Perrier — a bottled‘ water company

in France — while talking about how much

If he says he didn’t
do anything wrong,

A whether that be doping
or hacking, we have to
believe him.

you hate justice, wait. Landis wasn’t done in
his scathing e—mail just yet.

“But certainly I hope it’s not lost on
anyone that it is a grand admission to hav-
ing substandard computers at their self-
proclaimed ‘nation’s best lab,”’ he also told
the Times.

Those last two sentences are the e-mail
equivalent of going out to eat in France and
ordering “freedom fries.”

Landis also denied any involvement with
the hacking.

It’s clear he needs our backing. Sure,
when we hear of computer hacking, we
want to imagine someone sneaking up to a
heavily guarded lab, disarming the guards,
acrobatically ﬂipping through a room se-
cured with an alarm system trigged by lasers,
magically guessing a bunch of passwords to
a giant computer and then blowing up the
lab on his way out. We want to imagine the
ultimate American — our James Bond or
Smash Adams.

Apparently, disappointingly, none of that
happened. Sure, he didn’t do anything spec-
tacular and inspiring like Lance Armstrong,
who won the Tour de France seven straight
times and dated Sheryl Crow. Still, we need
to support Landis here.

If he says he didn’t do anything wrong,
whether that be doping or hacking, we have
to believe him. He’s an American, and he’s
in the midst of being called a liar by French
people. That’s bigger than the Winter Olym-
pics. '

Stop pretending to wear an American ﬂag
as a cloak and to care about Shaun White
when we both know that you don’t. Instead
use all that patriotism to support someone
who really needs it: Landis, Floyd Landis.
