After working for seven years in the per-
sonnel department of the University of

Pittsburgh Medical Center, Catherine
Loughner received numerous awards for her
efforts to employ minority and handicapped
people. '

Her superiors evenpraisedher workas a
ﬁne example of the hospital’s hiring practices.

But since March of 1996, the UPMC lms
beeninur1datedwithclaimsofracialharass-
ment Loughner, a white woman, resigned
outofprotestinDecemberandhasﬁ1eda
lawsuit against Pitt alleging that discrimina-
tion became a hiring policy of the hospital
corporation.

Now, officials are beginning diversity
workshops for UPMC managers, based on
the recommendation of a special board hired
to examine the hospital.

But Loughner claims racial harassment
continues to this day and the hospital corpo-
ration’s efforts are “just a big joke.”

UPMC oﬂicials refuse to discuss any lit-
igation, and they say efforts at diversity train-
ing have nothing to do with complaints of
racial harassment

“We’re growing so signiﬁcantly in so
many areas that managing diversity is just a
basic tool of good management,” said Ron
Forsythe, UPMC vice president of facilities
and support services. ‘This is not a knee jerk
response to [the allegations.]”

Charges of discrimination ﬁrst came
from workers in Forsythe’s own department
and were sent through the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission and
the Pittsburgh Commission on Human

  

Relations. Spokesmen from both organiza-
tions are forbidden from commenting on the
cases.
Loughner ﬁled her complaint in the
Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas
and is suing for back pay. The case is still

g.
She said the problem began more than a
year ago, after her superior, Joann Matten,
ordered her to start building a better hospital
staff by hiring people from “non-special inter-
est” groups. V
“I guess they didn’t think minorities con-
tributed to proﬁtability,” Loughner said
Matten was unavailable for comment
Ignoring the order, Lougtmer continued
to interview people with disabilities and those
of different races.
_She said she believed the order purpose-
fully denied equal employment to people
based on color and non-job—related handi-

caps.

' “I was the only person in the oﬁice who
had to follow a quota,” she said “It started
aftersixyears,andIwaswritIenupifIdidnot
meet [hospital] standards.”

‘Loughner said “hospital standards”
meant interviewing only white, non-handi-
capped individuals for the UPMC temporary
pool.
“Before, I hired people for various tem-
porary positions who had handicaps, like deaf
people who did billing, or a [minority]

‘ research assistant,” she said “Some stayed on

as full-tirne employees, even though they
only startedastemps, sotheymusthavebeen
ﬁne employees.”

. But Loughner’s superiors did not agree
with her. '

Pitt Police contract
negotiations end in
retroactive raises  

ean Marie Zelt

After more ﬂran three years of negotiations, Pitt and its police
union have ﬁnally agreed to a new contract for the campus police
force.

Pitt and union officials signed a new four—year contract
Monday that raises police salaries and changes the method of
their healttrcare payment.

Since 1994, campus police have worked under an extension
of their old agreement, which did not provide for an increase of
According to Ken Service, Pitt spokesman, the salary hike
was the par_amount issue. He said the pay raise reﬂects the fact that
oﬂicers have not received an increase in several years.

Under the new agreement, the police will receive a 4 percent
pay increase effective July 1, 1996. Each following year, their
salaries will increase 3 percent.

Assistant Chief Gary Moses said the contract was made
retroactive to ensure that oﬂicers would get the pay raise they
deserve as soon as possible.

Union President Albert Fink said making the contract‘

retroactive “really helped,” butthat city police still make ﬁorn
$1 1,000 to $12,000 more for performing the same duties as carri-
pus oﬁicers. '

“The raise isn’t so bad, given the economic climate, but I
would feel better if the base wage was a little more in sync with
other departments our size in Allegheny County,” said Fink

Both Service and Moses stressed that the contract dispute did
not interfere with campus safety or the quality of police service.

“[During. the contract dispute] the officers perfomied their
duties beyond standards. We are happy and proud that we saw no
drop-off in service,” Moses said.

Both sides are happy an agreement was ﬁnalized, but police
oﬂicials said that, in the ranks, there are still somehard feelings
toward Pitt.

Fink said the police force tried to maintain its professional
approach during the lengthy negotiations, but “it left a bad taste in
our mouth [because] they praise us, but can’t bargain in a fair
manner.”

He said the union is handicapped because it has no rights to

_ binding arbitration, and he said he believes Pitt took advantage of

the fact that the campus police were unlikely to go on strike.

“I think morale would be a lot better in our department if the
University negotiators would have acted in a more fair marmer,”
Fink said i

Still, he said he believes the oﬁicers are satisﬁed they
received a decent raise.

“Most of us are realizing it’s the best offer we’re going to get,
so we’ll settle for it,” said one oﬂicer, who asked to remain anony-
mous. “We’re very much glad it’s over. It just took way too long.”

The agreement, suggested by a mediator, was ratiﬁed by the
union 46 to 3, and will run through June 30, 2000.

It provides for increases in salaries and uniform allowances,
new minimmn amounts of overtime compensation for court
appearances and changes in payment of health care beneﬁts.

New retirement package
should be done this week

   

FNUZZO

 

University officials expect an exo-
dus of older faculty, if an early retire-
ment program slated for submission to
the chancellor’s ofﬁce later this week is
approved.

“On the part of the faculty, there is ,

a lot of expectancy. We have waited a
long time,” said Keith McDuff1e, a
member of the ad-hoc committee
designing the early retirement package.
“I expect when it’s announced, there
will be a number of retirements.”

McDuffie reported during
'I‘uesday’s University Senate meeting
that the proposal “should be moving out
of committee to the chancellor very
shortly.”
‘ He said he expects to have the pro-
posal in Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s
office as soon as Friday, but McDufﬁe
said he wasn’t sure if that would neces-
sarily be the comn1ittee’s last meeting.

Nordenberg appointed the commit-
tee in January to design a retirement
package that encourages older, tenured
faculty to retire and make room for
younger, lower-paid faculty.

Only ﬁve faculty members retired
within the last year, though 300 were
eligible, according to McDuff1e. He

_ added that approximately 100 profes-

sors retire annually, but many eligible
faculty have been waiting for the com-

mittee to design a suitable retirement
package before leaving Pitt.

The committee received the
approved proposal from the Faculty
Assembly early this week. The assem-
bly’s approval was not required, but it
bolsters overall faculty support for the
proposal.

Once it gets to Nordenberg’s office,
McDufﬁe said that the proposal will
take at least several weeks before it is
finally approved.

“[Nordenberg] can’t make a snap-
judgement. He needs time to think,”
said McDufﬁe. “This involves ﬁscal
obligations.”

But the delay has caused the nearly
300 tenured faculty eligible for retire-
ment to stay at Pitt —— earning an aver-
age salary of $60,000 — costing the
University $18 million annually. The
proposed retirement package would
cost $12 million.

“A normal retirement situation
would have paid for salary increases
this year,” said Richard Pratt, senate
budget policies committee chair, at last
week’s meeting.

At the senate meeting Tuesday,
Pratt delivered a report on the faculty
salary raises for the coming year.

Because of low funds, Pratt’s report
stated that instead of a pay raise which
corresponds to the Consumer Price
Index, raises will be based on a per-
centage of that this year.

Public health gets new AIDS chair

 

JetLS h

   

Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health recently appointed renowned AIDS
researcher Dr. Charles R. Rinaldo Jr. chair-
man of the department of infectious dis-
eases and microbiology.

Rinaldo said his primary goals as chair
are to increase the number of faculty mem-
bers in the department and to expand the
areas of research in which the department is
involved.

He said he would speciﬁcally like to
see research areas include the AIDS and
herpes viruses, hepatitis and other new
emerging infectious diseases of global
interest.

Rinaldo said he also plans to strength-
en the lirrk between the six departments
within the Graduate School of Public
Health and to continue to strengthen pre-
existing relations with other departments at
the University, such as the School of
Medicine.

fronting AIDS and other emerging infec-
tious diseases,” Rinaldo said.

Currently, Rinaldo is the assistant
director of clinical microbiology for the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
and the director of the AIDS-related malig-

Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

He has also served as the Pittsburgh
area director of the national Multi-Center
AIDS Cohort Study, locally known as the
Pitt men’s study. ‘

The men’s study has had ground-
breaking results indicating that the viral
load—or.the level ofHIVvirus———inthe
blood is a good warning that a person with
HIV will develop full-blown AIDS in the
next 10 years.

Rinaldo earned his doctorate degree
from the University of Utah after receiving
his undergraduate degree from Syracuse
University. He conducted his post—doctoral
research at Massachusetts General Hospital
before becoming a member of the
Department of Pathology at Pitt’s School of
Medicine in 1978.

A month later, Matten again ordered her
to make interviewing minorities and disabled
people a “last priority,” the lawsuit alleges.

Loughner said she continued to disobey
these orders and was punished by superiors
with an “oppressive” worldoad. She received
letters of warning during the summer after
failing again to meet her quota of white and
non—handicapped people.

Sid Seligrnan, UPMC director of human
resources, received numerous objections
about the policy ﬁom Lougtmer, the lawsuit
stated.

In response, Katie Devine, assistant
administrator of human resources, told
Loughner that the hospital will “no longer
have the luxury” to hire pwple from special
interest groups as it continues to grow,
according to the lawsuit

Neither Devine nor Seligrnan could be
reached for comment

After letters of warning from her super-
visors, Louglmer says she objected to the pol-
icy to various other managers including the
assistant labor counsel, the director of
Employee Relations and even so high as the
vice president of the hospital network’,
George Huber.

She said she received many e-mail mes-
sages from her superiors describing the hos-
pital’s wish to hire only white and non-dis-
abled people.

“I went to [Huber] and was ignored,”
she said “I wrote that conditions were intol-
erable, and got nothing.”

Loughner’s lawyer tried contacting
Huber, but all complaints were refened back
to Seligman, one of the alleged wrongdoers.

Her superiors continued to harass her
and  against others for several
more months, she claims. By December, her
workload had become unbearable.

“When they don’t like what you say or
do, they say you have a ‘performance prob-
lem,”’ Loughner said. Adding work to her
schedule until it became impossible to ﬁnish
was a way of discrediting her, she said

Loughner’s lawyer, Hoover, said it was
a form of retaliation for her opposition to the
hiring policy and quota system.

Because she continued to interview
minorities and disabled people, Selignran,
Devine and Matten made work increasingly
more difficult until Lougtmer began to suffer
physical and mental distress, the lawsuit
alleges.

“They made my life a living hell,” she
said.

Louglmer took leave in late December
of 1996, until hospital oﬂicials stopped the
discriminatory practices and the harassment
directed toward her for ﬁghting it.

Her lawsuit states that UPMC oﬁicials
tried to hide evidence of its discnmination
policy and her opposition to it by “fabricat-
ing” a letter to her on December 23.

The letter, ﬁorn Matten, stated that
Loughner neglected to process many of the
job applications of the people she inter-
viewed and that she failed to send letters of
regret to some applicants that the hospital did
not hire.

THE PI'I"I' NEWS

After the hospital refused to change its
policy and Louglmer refused to come back to
work, she was ﬁred

Louglmer said she does not know why
the hospital suddenly began the policy to dis-
 but is glad she fought against
them.

“People are afraid They’re afraid of
UPMC. No one wants to say anything about
them,” she said “They own this city.”

Hoover said his client’s eiforts eventual-
ly made her an object of discrimination, too.

“When you retaliate against someone
for refusing to participate in discriminatory
practices, you are discriminating against that
person,” he said “When you hire someone it
is under an unspoken agreement that you
will, one, not ask them to break the law by

discriminating against others, and two that
you will pay them The hospital broke both
agreements.”

Loughner ﬁled a lawsuit against the
University in April and is awaiting trial. The
money she is suing for is back pay and over-
time earned while battling her extreme work-
load

“I’m sony that it had to be against Pitt,”
she said “Pitt didn’t do anything. It was all
UPMC. But since the two are related, there is
no way around it.”

Loughner now works in the Olston
Staﬂing Agency in Downtown Pittsburgh.

Because her case and others’ are still
pending, Hoover is quick to note that any
changes in the UPMC are self—irnposed and
not the result of any court order.

Forsythe said the new diversity training
seminars will affect more than 120 hospital
managers next year and has already been
tested on smaller groups to “good results.”

“We seek to establish a diiferent thought
process on diversity,” he said “It isn’t just
about ethnicity, race or gender. It’s about
dealing with people from many other back-
grounds.”

Forsythe said he hopes the program will
expand to train almost 12, 000 employees.

But people like Loughner are skeptical
and say discrinrination still hovers over the
heads of hospital employees.

“There will always be naysayers and
doomsayers,” Forsythe said. “People will
feel how they want to feel. Early evaluations
of this program are very positive.”

EDITORIAL

UPMC does not deserve
the prestige of its name

It’s a sad day when we hear about unethical and ille-
gal practices going on in our own backyard. It is a very
sad day when we hear that it is a hospital discriminating
against race and handicap in its hiring practices. It is a
tragic day when it is a hospital associated with a univer-
sity that is supposed to be a model of diversity in action.

UPMC is requiring that some of its personnel
receive “diversity training” in response to a lawsuit
claiming they engaged in discriminatory hiring prac-
tices. That is, UPMC is being told what it already knew
and what it didn’t seem to care about before —— diversi-
ty in the work place is important, and discrimination is
not only illegal, it is wrong. Still, this is not enough.

Perhaps Pitt itself should get involved with this, on
a legal level.

UPMC carries the moniker “University of
Pittsburgh” as part of its name. Up until now, we’ve
allowed the hospital to use that name because it seemed
to generate more positive publicity for the school than
negative. But that may not be the case anymore, if
UPMC is giving this school a" bad name. Perhaps it
shouldn’t share our name.

Pitt has a policy affirming its commitment to nondis-
criminatory, equal—opportunity and affirmative action in
employment. The current policy, which became effec-
tive July 28, 1992, outlines Pitt’s program for imple-
menting these practices throughout all Pitt programs and
activities. (Documentation of this policy can be found
online at www.pitt.edu. Choose the link for faculty and
staff and follow the links regarding policy until you see
it).

If Pitt is truly committed to such a policy, then sure-
ly it would respond with stronger measures than “diver-
sity training” if such outrageous practices were discov-
ered within Pitt itself. But these acts might as well have
occurred within the school because very few people out-
side of Pitt will know that there is a difference between
UPMC and Pitt when they hear about this suit.

Either UPMC should take greater measures against
this type of ignorant practice, or it should change its
name. The name of this University carries with it much
prestige, and UPMC should not be allowed to share that
name if it is undeserving of the honor.

  Help! Pitt is out t get me!

After all the warmth and support I’ve received in

' the past two weeks due to my last opinions column,

I’ve had time to think about things. Everyday, I grow
more and more paranoid that Pitt is out to get me.
This is my conspiracy theory:

I recently received a letter in the mail informing
me that the Oﬂice of Strident Accounts put a hold on
my account. This means that I can attend classes, but
will receive no grade. I can’t get a transcript either.

last week’s Time, including the cover article on
“Generation-X.” It said that my generation (the “X-
ers”) is anti-conservative. If a school wants to attract

them don’t like conservatives, the conservatives
must be silenced

I gave my “Pitt Card” to the cashier at Uncle Sarn’s,
and to my dismay, I was rejected I began to think,
“Can ﬁnancial services hold sway over American
Express, too? Can they really shut off my Campus
Funds? I thought my ‘card works here?!’” Contrary
to the slogan, the PittCard works just about nowhere.
For example, I’ve been going to Giant Eagle in the
hopes of buying food for about four weeks now, and
the machine is broken. I gave up after the cashier told
me he didn’t know when it would be ﬁxed Krauser’s
has a machine, but the guys don’t know how to work
it. I had to give my ID number to Parnela’s because
they didn’t know how to work the machine. And,
lastly, I’m afraid they’ll get mad if I use it at the “O.”
The ﬁiendly disposition of the O’s employees (Do
they work at Giant Eagle in the day?) make the
atmosphere of this ﬁve-star establishment seethe
with helpfulness and understanding. But I digress.

VVrththeseideasinmyhead,Iwasﬁnally
relieved that my card did, in fact, work. The only
thing I want money for is beer and cigarettes —- the
only two things you can’t buy with the card.
Coincidence? I think not.

Pitt is going out of their way to destroy me, even
at the expense of other students. The previous is an
example of this. No one can buy beer and/or ciga-
rettes with the card In fact, UBC doesn’t even take
credit cards, so I’m really screwed there. Thank God
that Mellinger’s does. Thanks, Patsy, you’re keeping
me alive.

Another reason I know Pitt is out to get me is the
fact that my requirement for International Foreign
Culture/Non—Westem is never ﬁlled despite my hav-
ing taken classes to do so. In fact, the aforementioned
class now ﬁlls my History requirement, a require-
ment I had already ﬁlled. When I asked them up in
140 Thackeray to switch it over (prompted by my
advisor’s advice), they told me “no,” that the com-
puter puts things where it wants to and to check
before I graduate. T'hat’s good. So when I check, I’ll
ﬁnd out that the computer won’t ﬁll the requirement
for me and that I won’t get a diploma T‘hat’s how
they keep my name and theirs separate. I'll bet they
destroy my ﬁles soon after. With only my word and

a Pitt t—shirt to prove I was here, no one will hire me.

In fact, Pitt’s arm is so long, they’re even able to
get the city after me. It would seem there is some sort
of housing code that says no more than three people
can live in a house unless they are related T‘here’s
ﬁve of us in out imitation palatial estates. I know of
atleastthreeotherhouses with morethanthreeunre-
lated people living there (one is ﬁve girls —— I think
that is still considered a brothel in Pennsylvania). But
who gets targeted? Not the 20 illegal immigrants liv-
ing in a one-room apartment.

Another problem in this is that we have to take
the locks off the bedroom doors. No one uses them
because it doesn’t matter, and they’re skeleton keys
anyway. To take them olf would be to dismantle an
80-year-old door, but the city doesn’t care about pro-
tecting historical landmarks.

On top of this, our landlady decided it was a con-
venient time, with the city housing inspector stop-
ping by and checking on us frequently (1 don’t know
how long the subterfuge can last), to tell us that she’s
received over 20 phone calls during the course of the
year saying we’re too loud and that we have people
over past 3 am. (So?). The cops have never come
over. No one ever complained to us. But Pitt took the
time to track down my landlady, and now she’s been
taken in by the system as well. I can’t escape.

The best thing I can do is trudge on. I could quit.
but someone might like that too much.

THE PITT NEWS

Americans smile Cl lot; does
it still mean anything to us?

 

It’s 8 a.m. I’m tired, and
I’m not functioning.

I walk into Bruegger’s for
coffee, and the woman in line
before me feels my presence
behind her and turns toward
me. She tilts her head slightly
and smiles.

I sigh and smile back.

As I approach the bus stop,
a guy in a blue jacket glances
up and smiles at me.

I take a sip of my coffee
and smile back.

I anive at work and wait
for an elevator. The
bell dings, the door
opens and I step on.
The businessman
already on the ele-
vator smiles at me,
then quickly shifts
his eyes away.

This time, I
don’t bother smil-
ing back — he
doesn’t really care
anyway.‘ He doesn’t
care because he is
only participating
in an unexplainable
and reﬂex-like phe-
nomenon of our
culture. I call it
“smile phenome-

,9

non.  -i

Smile phenomenon occurs
when we shoot short and
meaningless smiles at people
for strange and trivial reasons,
or when we return one just
because the other person did it
first.

Exactly what we are smi1- ‘

ing about? (This question is
not rhetorical.)

Was the woman in
Bruegger’s the “welcome-to-
the-coffee-line-at-Bruegger’s”
woman? Was the businessman
the “welcome-to-the-elevator”
guy? Was the the guy in the
blue jacket the president of the
"bus—stop—welcoming-commit-
tee?” (These are rhetorical.)

If anyone out there does
know what everyone is always
smiling about, let me know.
(And I know for damn sure
that it is not because we are all
happy-jolly people all the
time.)

I have actually thought
about smile phenomenon a lot

in the past few years. My inter-
est was sparked by a Russian
teacher in high-school. Before
a trip to Russia, she told us that
a smile in Russia means more
than it does here and that we
shouldn’t expect anyone we
don’t know to smile at us. (I
thought it was a strange thing

to tell us.)

But, in general, she was
right. I must stress “in gener-
al.” I am not suggesting that
Russians are grumpy and don’t
ever smile. I am only pointing
out a cultural difference in
order to support my claim that
Americans smile a lot and for

goofy reasons.

I became
even more interested
in smile phenomenon
when a Russian
instructor from Pitt
told me that when she
first anived in
America, she could-
n’t understand why
people smiled at her
all the time. She
wanted to know why
people smiled at her
when she got on an
elevator. She thought

‘ maybe she looked
funny.

Finally, after
living here for a little
while and experienc-

ing American culture, she real-
ized that it’s not her —— it’s us.

She realized that we just smile.

a lot and for no real reason.
(It’s a tad ironic, because she
has fallen victim to smile phe-
nomenon herself — although it
doesn’t bother her.)

Try observing people
around you one day. Notice the
smirky smiles tossed at you
from the other person walking
through a doorway. Notice the
awkward smile you get from
the person walking toward you
when you are walking through
an empty hallway. Notice when
other people are smiled at.

Any similarities?

. From my own observa-
tions, there are certain criteria
necessary for smile phenome-
non to occur.

0 First, as the recipient of a
smile, you must be a stranger
to the smiler. (It doesn’t count
if someone from your 350-per-
son psychology class, whose

name you don’t even know,
smiles at you.)

0 Second, you must be in a
situation, most often in a pub-
lic area, where you and the
smiler will be sharing a com-
mon activity (for example,
waiting for public transporta-
tion or climbing up a stair-
well).

0 Third, there should be no
other reason that this person
would be smiling at you (like if
you opened a door for some-
one).

There probably are some
exceptions, but I have not
noticed them yet.

Now that we know why
we are smiled at, let’s think
about why we smile back.

’ Any suggestions?

The only reason I have
been able to come up with, is
that the “smile—back” is a
reﬂex. It is a conditioned and
automatic reaction. (Again,
this is only a generalization. I
don’t think that all smiles are
completely meaningless.
Maybe you think the guy/girl
walking toward you in the hall
is really hot, and you feel com-
pelled to smile, hoping to get a
reaction.)

I know it is a reﬂex
because I have “tested”
myself. I have tried to go an
entire day without smiling in
those goofy situations when
there really is no reason to
smile. I also tried to not do the
“smile-back.”

Was I successful?

Nope. Not in the least. I
found myself thinking, “Jeez,
people will think I’m rude and
grumpy if I don’t smile back.”

And y’know, I don’t want
people to think I am rude and
grumpy. (I have a hard enough
time when my friends tell me
that I always look pissed off,
when it’s really just my natural
expression.)

So I say keep smiling and
try to have something to smile
about.

Besides,what is a smile
worth if there is nothing
behind it? '

Alison Novicki plans to spend
the next year studying in
Russia, but hopes to remember
how to smile when she comes
back.

The Point gets invaded by scrap-bots, men of
steel and other mechanical whatsits as the
Three Rivers Arts Festival takes over downtown

 

.J99n.M.°.r' elf

 

The giant robot SCRAPina may seem
harmless enough, standing in the middle of
Point State Park, looking like a cybernetic gum-
ball machine covered in grafﬁti, but some visi-
tors to the Three Rivers Arts Festival aren’t so

sure.

“That thing moved,” says a nervous passer-
by as he sneaks a glance over his shoulder. “I
swear it was looking in the other direction just a
minute ago.”

Luckily, most of the exhibits at the festival
aren’t so unsettling.

From now until June 22, Pittsburghers have
the chance to play art critic, hear free music and
gorge on cotton candy. Just hop off the bus
downtown, stroll a block in any direction and
you’ll run smack into the action.

Get to the Point

For the real festival atmosphere, stick to
Gateway Center and Point State Park. As soon
as you cross Stanwix Street, you can hear the
music and smell the funnel cakes.

On the way over to the Point, you’ll proba-
bly pass a few impromptu concerts by street
musicians (These can draw a larger crowd than
the official events).

Next you’H encounter the food —- the ever-
increasingly overpriced hot dogs, candied
apples, gyros and lemonade. Vendors will also
accommodate those of you who must have cof-
fee and croissants with your art. Something will
inevitably be irresistible, so give in, take a snack
break and enjoy the music coming ﬁom one of
the Point’s two stages.

Musical oﬁerings vary, from folk and a

  

cappella to jazz and modern rock, depending on

‘ " the time and stage. Artists featured are from

local groups as well as nationally acclaimed
recording artists (see schedule).

The Point is also the home of the festival’s
largest works of art. In addition to SCRAPina,
the robot, site—speciﬁc sculptures, including Tm
Kaulen’s “Consumer Vinyl Idol,” a 30-foot-tall
inﬂatable monument to consumer culture, tower
over the other exhibits.

Kaulen also directed a group of 20 local
artists in the construction of three larger—than-life
steelworker ﬁgures and a giant butterﬂy, which
commemorate the rebirth of the Pittsburgh area
after the decline of the region’s industrial econ-
omy.

Want to take some art home?

The Artist’s Market at Gateway Center,
open Fridays through Sundays, features more
than 400 booths full of stuff, some of which
seems to be more exotic than the art in the juried
exhibits.

For example: Pick up the colorful, blown-
glass vase that’s right out of a “Jetsons” cartoon
and would look great on your desk. Turn it
around in your hands and admire it from every
angle — until you see the $2,000 price tag. Put
it down, reeeeeeal gently, and tiptoe over to the
$20 bud vases, being careful not to breathe until
you’re quite a way down the aisle.

If beautiful but high-priced knick-knacks,
such as vases and framed calligraphic prints
aren’t your thing, there are plenty of artsy ver-
sions of more mundane objects such as hand-
carved wooden pens, exquisitely tooled leather
bags and wallets, jewelry and musical instru-
ments sculpted into non-traditional shapes,

THE PITT NEWS

Wilson’s ”Seven Guitars” shows the hopes

   

Wednesday, June ‘I 1, I997

    

and heartaches of the Hill District's past

 

The Hill District was widely hailed as
the center of Pittsburgh’s thriving jazz and
blues culture -— 50 years ago. Today, it’s
known as a neighborhood at the mercy of
poverty, crime and corruption, and many in
Pittsburgh would just as soon pretend it
doesn’t exist.

August Wﬂson, the Burgh’s most cele-
brated playwright, is one who does care
about the Hill. His latest play, “Seven
Guitars,” takes a snapshot of the communi-
ty circa 1948 and reverberates with the
soulful, heartbreaking melodies of people
struggling to survive and ﬁnd moments of
happiness.

The production features a stunning
cast whose characters speak with a realism
that is hard to capture in theatre. Leland
Gantt plays Floyd ”Schoolboy” Barton, a
powerful singer who has a chance to make
a hit record in Chicago. Through his desires
and ambition, the performance dramatizes
the risks a black man must take to achieve
a life of fame.

Lisa Louise Langford plays Vera,
Barton’s former love whom he is wooing
once again, with the poignant grace of a
honest woman who has left home to ﬁnd
sanity and comfort. Clayton Lebouef and

 

Russell Andrews
play Barton’s
more down—to—
earth buddies and
fellow musicians
— strong person-
alities who are
aware of the
impracticalities of
simply scamper-
ing off to Chicago
to make a record.
However, it is
the crazy old man
who stumbles
-4- A _ around at the bot-
tom of the stairs
Leland Gan" that gives the play
its powerful message. Keith Randolph
Smith is Hedley, a man sick with tubercu-
losis. Hedley hears the struggling voices of
the past speaking to him and is driven mad
by his dream of being a powerful planta-

 

' tion owner. Through Hedley, the characters

see their ancestry and know that the world
has never been on the side of the black
man.
The stage is lit dimly, capturing the
play’s twin moods of despair and hope.
Wilson’s characters are passionately alive
with the poor man's dream of overcoming
oppression, and his script moves through

their lives with awareness of the roots of
slavery and the ﬁght for equal opportuni-
ties.

The story of Wilson’s characters’ hard-
ships can still be found in their songs and
dances. When the world didn’t seem right
— and even when it did -— they used their
voices to sing and their feet to stomp.
These Pittsburgh .
musicians lived in
a black community 
that whites were 
afraid to enter; it
has now been J
uncovered for the 7
audience to see and 
feel. Wilson’s 
script leaves much 
unresolved, as 
does life itself: ,
There is no real 
end to the ’
heartache in peo-
ple’s lives.

“ S e v e n
Guitars” is a reﬂection of how our society
alienated an entire race without ever bother-
ing to look at the individual people within it.
The audience leaves the play having caught

American who seeks an identity of his own.

clothing made of hand-stenciled fabric and
the most complex tie-dye you’ll ever see.

At least it’s free to look, and most of the
merchants will let you play with, try on or
try out their wares as long as you're careful
and willing to chat for a few minutes.

You might even leam something, like
how to keep a bonsai tree under control
(trim the underside and pinch off the top
leaves periodically) or what materials make
the best drums (red oak and goat skin).

Just be patient and watch your toes,
because the crowd doesn’t move fast
through the narrow aisles. If nothing else, it
will give you time to search for something
under $20 (it can be done) and enjoy the
musicians on the acoustic stage.

Art all around the place!

The two-dimensional art category of
the juried visual arts exhibition is on display
at Gateway Center Plaza 4 and features over
100 works by over 70 artists. Some of the art
is immediately eye-catching, such as the
two-toned clusters of stars representing dif-
ferent states. (Why is New York black on
white while Michigan is white on blue?
Who lmows — but it’s nice to look at.)
Other works are extraordinarily poor, such
as “The Death of Pop?”, a corny series of
crayon-like rubbings of Andy Warhol’s
tombstone.

 

 

ii: FROM PAGE 9 ifffif

The rest of the juried visual art exhibi-
tions are on display in the USX Tower
Lobby (sculpture and crafts) and the Bell
Atlantic Assembly Room (photography).

PPG Place features Robert Qualters’
colorful architectural installation “An
Industrial Compound in a Distant Lan ” in
the outside plaza, as well as paintings and
prints in the Wmtergarden and a photo-
graphic history of the Pittsburgh Penguins

Tim Kaule’s steelworkers of the past gaze at the butterﬂy, bol the future

 

on the ground ﬂoor of Building 2.

The spirit of the arts festival in summed
up best in one exhibit: the Wood Street
Galleries’ “Ten + 102” project. This collec-
tion of collaborations between 10 local high
school students and 10 regional artists
shows that art is alive and well in the inter-
action between practicing artists and art
lovers of all kinds.

Nicholas Cage iumps around and pumps the Iestosterone level WAY up in Air:

Character actors get to play

even more psychos in Con Air

If you think
computerized
dinosaurs are over-
rated and can’t
even begin to
believe that Sandra
Bullock could get
stuck on yet anoth-
er runaway vehicle,
then Con Air may
just be your kind of action movie.

Con Air begins with recently dis-
charged Army Ranger Cameron Poe
(Nicholas Cage) killing a man during a
machismo y bravado ﬁght to protect his
wife. Because his special forces training
classiﬁes him as a “deadly weapon,” Poe is
convicted —— but eventually paroled.

As he heads home, Poe is stuck on a
plane full of America’s most dangerous
criminals, who are being transferred to a
new top—1eve1 security prison. But a cleverly
premeditated escape allows the airborne
prisoners to take over the plane.

While Cyrus “The Virus” Grissom
(John Malkovich), black militant group
leader Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) and
serial rapist Johrmy 23 (Danny Trejo) try to
stay one landing strip ahead of the Feds, Poe
realizes that it’s up to him to bring them in.
After a stop to pick up mellow serial killer
Garland Greene (Steve Busoemi), the real
action takes ﬂight

Eventually, grounded Federal Marshal
Vince Larkin (John Cusack) becomes con-
vinced that Poe is covertly working to bring
down the cons’ plans and contacts him
through several scant and unconventionally
delivered messages. The ﬂight comes in for
an unscheduled landing on the Las Vegas

 

Co|mMeaney’sinif?|tHAStobegood!

strip, a smashing climax with bangs aplenty.

Con Air breaks away from the 2.5-hour-
long advertisement genre of this sumrner’s
movies and lets its all-star cast do something
almost unheard of in today’s action movie:
act.

Malkovich takes his role as a deranged
individual in In The Line of F ire and ups the

psychotic ante. Buscemi, who portrays a .

bipolar personality, ﬂuctuates believably
between comic relief and dark realism. Cage
is at his best since The Rock, and Cusack
overcomes most of the underdevelopment
his character suffers from in the script.

Replete with decent special effects and
an all-star cast, Con Air is a high-energy,
thrill-a—minute ride.

Hard-nosed

Bowman earns
his eighth

I would like to take this time to
congratulate the great Scott
Bowman.

Last weekend, he won his sev-
enth Stanley Cup ring as a head
coach and his eighth overall.
Bowman could stick around and
keep coaching, but he really has
nothing left to accomplish. He is
the all—time record holder for
coaching wins and second in
Stanley Cup wins.

And, sadly, li'e’s one of the least
respected coaches in hockey.

These things do not seem to go
together very well, but they are all
true. Players seem to hate Bowman
with a passion. They do not enjoy
playing for him at all. They may
not enjoy playing for him, but he
gets the job done, and the players
love to win the Cup.

Bowman is a hard-nosed coach
who believes that good defense
wins championships. God forbid,
but he made J aromir J agr and Mario
Lemieux backcheck.

He also made his players sweat
at practice. This really bothered
some prima donnas, especially

’ superstars used to the coddling of

other, less-successful coaches.
Coaches that don’t even have
enough rings to cover a whole
hand. A

Bowman has never really
enjoyed a Stanley Cup until this
year; he has always watched from
the sidelines and let his teams bask
in the moment. This time though,
he did things a bit differently -— he
strapped on his skates’ and took
Lord Stanley’s prize for a little
ride. ,

This is probably the first time
in history a coach has put on skates
and enjoyed a victory this much. If
anyone deserved this, it is
Bowman. He had always wanted to
be a player in the NHL but never
had the opportunity. So, last
Saturday he got to live a part of his
dream by skating with the silver.

Bowman has endured harsh
criticism from every angle — the
media, the players, the owners, the
hot dog vendors, everybody. He
won a Stanley Cup in Pittsburgh

Smith wins NCAA long jump

Takes fifth in triple jump before injury in heptathlon

I 9

__Rq_.che-|_ Lenzi

A pulled hamstring sidelined
Pitt track star Trecia Smith at the
NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
National Championships at the
University of Indiana, but not
before she won the national title in
the long jump.

Add that to a list of accolades
that includes five-time All-
American, national record holder
in the triple jump, the ECAC
Championship’s Women’s
Outstanding Performer of 1997‘ and
the prestigious title of female
Division I Athlete of the Year,
which she received last week.

Trecia Smith has a full trophy
case. ,

She became the second Pitt
track performer in as many years to
earn the Division I title, as selected
by the United States Track and
Field Coaches Association.

Najuma Fletcher, now a graduate

assistant with the Pitt track and
field program, won the award last
year.

Smith won the long jump last
Wednesday with a leap of 21-10,
edging out Rhonda Swift of Florida
International University by eight
inches.

courtesy Trockwire

Smith adds NCAA gold to her ECAC
crown and'A||-American status.

Smith placed fifth in the triple
jump, leaping 44-9.75. Her meet
wasn’t even half over at that point;
she was looking to place in three
other events as well — the high
jump, shot put and the heptathlon.

In the heptathlon, Smith com-
peted against 17 other competitors

from around the country. Things

 

were going well for the native of
Jamaica until the triple jump com-
petition. Despite placing fifth,
Smith succumbed to the injury that
eventually forced her out of the
three remaining events.

“It wouldn’t have been a ques-
tion of what she would have done,”
said Head Coach Steve Lewis.
“Trecia was certainly en route to
having an outstanding meet,
regardless of the injury.”

Tiffany Lott, a Brigham Young
University junior, captured the
national heptathlon championship
by scoring 3693 points in seven
events over four days.

Two other competitors repre-
sented Pitt in Bloomington —
senior Angie Martin and freshman
Chantee Earl. Both ran in the 800-
meter run on June 4. .

Martin was in pursuit of a final
shot at an NCAA title, while Earl
was just getting her feet wet at her
first NCAA championship meet.

Martin went to Bloomington
ranked 12th in the country in the
800 and ran the semifinal trials in
2:07.51, finishing sixth in her heat
and 16th overall.

Considered to be one of the top
half—milers in the East, Martin fin-
ished the 800 five seconds behind

Pittsburgh Angels triumph with 5-0 victory

c Knopsnyder

 

The Pittsburgh Angels Women’s
rugby club closed out their spring
season with a 5-0 win over the
Columbus Women’s rugby club in
the annual Travelers Aid Cup tour-
nament at Hartwood Acres.

Melissa Nelson scored the only

I try of the game in the second half

on a penalty play. Kim Kluse was
unable to make the conversion, but
it did not matter, as the Angels held
on for the win.

Angel Phyllis Long was
impressed with the Columbus team
and with the Angels’ performance.

“I think they’re always tough,”
Long said of their opponents.
“They are big, and they hit hard.

But I think we did well in the
scrums.”

The . Angels were without
Captain Idi Okilo, so Kim Nestor
assumed the leadership role for the
cuptcontest.

She made an important deci-
sion before the game even began.
When the Angels won the coin
toss, Nestor decided to pick the
side that the Angels would defend,
rather than choosing to kick or
receive.

This was important because the
field at Hartwood Acres had a dis-
tinctive slope to it.

“I chose to have the downhill
side last,” Nestor said. “Columbus
is not a very fit team, and if they
had the downhill side first, I fig-
ured they’d be tired in the second

IItIitcitUIIvc|I4nct

half, when they had to go uphill.”

Angel Xerona Raines thought
the strategy worked well.

“I believe we tired them out in
the second half,’’ Raines said.
“They were going uphill and the
wind was in our advantage, too.”

Long was not as convinced.
“Well, that was our strategy, any-
way,” she said. “I don’t know if
they were tired or not.”

The Angels struggled to keep
Columbus out of the try zone
(rugby’s scoring zone) in the first
half. Raines touched the ball down
in the Angels’ try zone at the very
end of the first half -— a stall tac-
tic that kept the Pittsburgh defense
safe. As a result, Columbus was
denied of what was probably its

and was promptly shoved aside by
players and ownership for the next
year’s campaign.

During the next season, the
players literally locked Bowman
out of practice. Despite this, he led
them to the best record in the
National Hockey League during the
regular season. An early playoff
exit was the team’s reward for
refusing Bowman’s coaching.

He was not allowed to draw up
game plans to help his team win.
He was just another name on the
pay list thanks to player revolt.

This was no fault of Bowman’s.
The players would not let him
coach the team, and there was noth-
ing he could do about it.

This was one of the worst
moves the Penguins have ever
made. They let the best coach in the
history of hockey get away because
he was too tough.

Since then, the coaches have
been the players’ friends instead of
telling them what to do. And, since
then, the only nice cups at the Civic
Arena have been Lemieux com-
memoratives. It will be even worse
next season, when Mario’s leader-
ship vanishes and no strong coach
is there to fill the void.

Bowman has not been liked
anywhere he has been. That may be
why he has moved around so much.
But whatever the local opinion of
him may be, it seems as if any-
where he moves, he wins.

In his first coaching job, he led
an expansion team to the Stanley
Cup finals. Then, he won five rings
with the lore of the Montreal
Canadiens. He was out of coaching
for a long time before he returned
to coach the Penguins to their sec-
ond Cup.

Finally, he won his seventh
(eighth, counting a front—office ring
from the Penguins) with the Red
Wings this year. Players may not
like him, but he gets the job done.

His all—business style has
apparently worked very well, and
people should not be so fast to crit-
icize him. He is a great coach and
has proven it with his actions.

After the Penguins gave him up,
they went completely downhill, and
now everyone in Pittsburgh is call-
ing for another hard—nosed coach. It
is too bad they let this one go.

Congratulations to Scotty, and I
hope he enjoys his retirement as
much as he did his Cup—skate.
Maybe someday, people will
remember the results and records,
instead of the whining of his play-
ers. I

“I thought we played really
well, defensively,” Nestor said.
“We had more offensive opportuni-
ties than we took advantage of, but
that’s okay because we won.”

Whether Columbus was tired or
not, the Angels managed the
game’s only score in the second
period. And despite the second-
half advantage of a sloped field,
Nelson’s goal counted just the
same, helping the -Angels finish
with a win.

tournament, was the final l5—per-
son game of the year. The Angels
will be entered in at least three
more tournaments this summer, but
those games will consist of only
seven players per side.

The number of Angels had
dwindled over the past_ few weeks,
as many Pitt students had gone
home for the summer. Many
returned for this game, but they
were still a bit rusty and only had
one practice together, according to
Nestor.

The Angles finished with final
record of 7-4-1 during the spring,
but struggled for consistency.

 FROM PAGE 12

1 “There were high points and
low points,” Long saidyof the sea-
son. “I don’t think that we were
very consistent.”

Long said that the inconsisten-
cy probably came more from the
high turnover rate of players and
coaches on the team than from
inexperience. “I hate to say it was
from a lack of experience because
we had some really good rookies,”
she said. ‘ ,

The Angels will compete in a
tournament in northern Virginia on
June 21. They will then travel to
Harrisburg, Pa., and Toronto in
July.’

Withrow, Woods and The
Pitt News sports briefing

Piﬂ Sports
0 Panther grapplers John Withrow
and Bryan Matusic were awarded

, positions on the‘ 1997 National
Wrestling Coaches Association
Academic All-American team.

Withrow, a senior who earned All-
American honors at this year’s NCAA
Championships, won a first-team posi-
tion with a 3.5 grade-point average. It
was his second All-Academic selection.

Matusic, also a senior, was an hon-
orable mention selection. The recipient
of the 1997 Pittsburgh Blue-Gold
award, he earned a 3.2 GPA‘ for the
1996-97 school year.

- While the wrestling team’s suc-
cess is well documented, it didn’t help
the University in its ﬁght for the Big
East Commissioner’s Trophy, awarded
each year’ to the school with the best
overall conference showing. The
Panthers ﬁnished last in the men’s
standings and eighth in the women’s
race. Notre Dame took both awards.

Points are awarded in reverse order,
with the conference champ in any given
sport earning 13 points and the last-
place ﬁnisher earning one. Football is
not included in the rankings, and the
Pitt wrestlers’ performance the Eastern
Wrestling League does not count
toward the school’s trophy ranking.

Golf

0 Starting tomorrow, Tiger Woods
has another chance to rewrite golf ’s
record book. 'The U.S. Open begins

play Thursday, and Woods will attempt
to become the first golfer in a quarter-
century to win two major golf titles in
one year.

Golf greats Jack Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer are among the ﬁeld of
media also-rans. It was Nicklaus who
Woods erased from the Masters’ record
books in April, and the Golden Bear’s
double-major victory in 1972 (Palmer
did it in 1960.) is the next piece of his-
tory Tiger hopes to match.

Basketball

0 Michael Jordan and company tee
off again tonight against the Utah Jazz
in game ﬁve of a tight two—apiece NBA
ﬁnal. Jordan’s last-second three—pointer
rimmed out on Sunday, leading to a
two-game sweep by the Jazz at home.

Thanks to their regular-season
record, the Bulls have homecourt
advantage for the series — a helping
hand for a team that has lost its last four
ﬁnals road games.

- While his team is battling true
competition for the first time in almost
two years, Scottie Pippen has become
the subject of numerous trade rumors.
The Bulls’ forward has expressed a
desire to stay in Chicago, but persistent
whispers place him in Philadelphia next
year. According to some, the Bulls
would receive the number-two pick in
the NBA draft this season and Jerry
Stackhouse to part with their long-time
second-ﬁddler.

“The half-mile was the most
competitive women’s event,” noted
Lewis. “Angie gave everything she
had.”

The Newport News, Va., native
completed an otherwise brilliant
senior season and track career while
earning her degree in psychology.
To top things off, the All—American
will compete in the U.S.A. National
Championships later on this week.

“This was not her final shot at a
title,” commented Lewis. “Angie

outdoor NCAA championship, save
for one, in her four years.”

Earl slightly edged out Martin,

her versatility and ability. Earl ran

. in events ranging from the 55—meter

run to the 1600-meter relay during
the outdoor season.

“Chantee finished the season as
the number one freshman in the
country and the ninth American
overall at the Championships,”
Lewis pointed out after the meet.‘
“She still has three years left, so
we’re expecting great things to
come.” .

Another Pitt athlete from the
Tidewater region of Virginia, Earl
will be competing in cro.ss country
in the fall, but will use the competi-
tion as preparation for next year’s
indoor and outdoor track seasons.

“The three women who repre-
sented Pitt performed admirably
and courageously,” said Lewis. “We
were very successful at the NCAAs
and throughout the season.”
