    Van Hook Takes BAS Chair

The Black Action Society (BAS)
elections wrapped up Wednesday
night with George Van Hook taking

, the Chairmanship and ‘Valerie
3;/j/",'-’,;~,_}’.QVilliams winning the position of
Deputy, Chairman .

BAS officials refused to release
the total vote. count or. the
victory-margin of either winner "in
line with what was described as
“BAS tradition” ' by Election
Committee ~ Chairman Gary
Plummer. 0‘

Van Hook took theielections over
opponents Willie Walker, Yakub

. and Baphi Walton, with Williams
winning over Michael Hayes.

Van Hook attributed‘ the increase

_ in voters to the use of election‘

machinery in the ‘Towers and
Student Union lower lobby, and
I increased participation by com-

“ 3"‘-’1=t1uters and on-campus residents.
The new BAS Chairman dedicated

himself to greater communication ' broadening the mange of A BAS

as a policy. aimed at making BAS

more “accessible”. to students.
“Blacks aren’t in a vacuum

anymore,” Van Hook said. ,“The

problems of the past have been ‘

student issues. , .

“I hope for a- complimentary‘
situation with SG (Student Govern-
ment). We can ‘work together
instead of independently, and make
up "for. the weakness of singlet
student organizations."

The next step for Van, Hook
appointments to the BAS Steering
Committee, the policy-making
body for the organization’. He

- urged {interested students to
‘ submit resumes with their ideas to

the BAS office as soon as possible.

Van Hook served as Deputy
Chairman under Graylyn Swilley

manship, and ran on a platform of

BA-S Candidates Cha rg eei

i Election lrregularities

BY GENE GRABOWSKI and
A. IRENE SCHMIDT

Two candidates for Black Action
Society (BAS) chairman charged
last night voters in- Wednesday’s
BAS election were unfairly inﬂu-
enced by pollworkers at the voting
booths. . 0 N ,

Defeated Candidates Willie_
Walker and Yakub alleged the

inﬂuence was part of a larger _ 1,.
. denied any k‘nowl_edge- of inﬂuence

pattern of illegal practices
throughout the election, including
discrepancies over the eligibility of
white voters. ' A _
Both Walker and Yakub‘ charged
election‘ workers at the Student
Union‘ (SU)‘ polling booth dis-
tributed campaign material‘ and
verbally encouraged voters to
choose candidate George‘ Van
,Hook. ‘ A
Black student Andy Luck sub-
stantiated the charge.

Rene Berry (a pollworker) , said. ‘ ‘I’

- Pitt will ‘face severe ﬁnancial

problems regardless 9f the out-'

come of present attempts to obtain
increased appropriations from the
state legislature, Chancellor Wes-'
ley Posvar said yesterday. ' _

In an interview "with the_ Pitt
News, Posvar said there is hope for
an amendment to ‘Governor Milton

J . Shapp"s suggested budget .allo- .

cation to the University.‘

‘_‘But that would onlytake us from"

, ‘a state of terrible difﬁcultyto one of

serious difficulty,”-the Chancellor i

said. ; 

According to_ Posvar, the "state
allocation is only a portion of Pitt’s"
yearly budget. No increases are
forthcoming from the other sources
such as alumni contributions ‘and
gifts. W 7

Asked if an increase in tuition was
inevitable in the present situation,
Posvar indicated it would be. “It is
like the weatherman who says
there is a 75 per cent chance of
rain, and when you look out the
window you see it is raining. That
is pretty much the situation ‘we are
in," he explained.

The Chancellor was uncertain how
extensive the increase would be.

ment President ;vLarry Platt an-."

ment _and provide them with fact
sheets, data and other logistic
help,” Posvar said. Platt and he
had discussed the plans earlier, he
added. 0 i

The Chancellor also said his office
would. discuss program cuts with
members of the three campusi
student governments.

Posvar, however, saw no need to

discuss any tuition increase withi

the student leaders. “Any decision
that is made‘ will to a very great
extent be forced upon us,”. he said.

He also said there was no need to

. allow students access to" the level-

one -budget as some Student Gov-
ernment members have asked, but

' added they would be provided with

general information. 4 .
The Chancellor’s executive assis-
tant, David Powers, said the level-

i one budget contains exact and
extensive lists of names and salar- i

ies, and in his opinion would not be
as helpful to students as the “Blue
Book." -

Lon N01 Spelled Backwards

BY W. JACK ROMBERG
“Good day, Mr. President.”
“Good day, gentlemen. Now I
know you are all wondering why I
called this little get-together. And
I won’t mince words with you.
Gentlemen, we are faced with a
crisis in foreign policy. Our
credibility is falling, and the
American people are crying for
stronger leadership and direction.
Are there any suggestions?”

“Yes, Mr. President. I have one.
You could issue a nationally
broadcast statement that would
assure the American people we are
aware of the problem and are
vigorously attacking our ‘ enemies‘
on all fronts.” A

“Excuse me, Mr. President, but I
don’t believe we‘ should use the
word attack. -This implies
America is a belligerent power.
We all know that America moves
only in self-defense. Therefore, I
suggest we substitute the word
“confront,” which implies we are
moving tofmeet a threat.”

“Gentlemen, I'm afraid you
misunderstand me. The American
people have read enough state-
ments without getting results.
Take Cambodia, for instance--

Americans have read a lot about -

our concern for Southeast Asia, but
nobody knows what sort of action
to take."

“Well sir, may I suggest we
re-institute the draft and send a
few of our boys over to clean up the’
mess. I would think a million or so
would do the trick. Ifl might say so
sir, the problem with Vietnam was

we never really committed our- 7

selves. I mean, if you’re going to
ﬁght a‘war, you might as well do it
right.” ~  " ,'  -

  Pldll Clears Up  I A
'*ilSt'ancl on Cuts A

a To the Editor:

I would like .to clear up ‘Ala
misunderstanding generated by
some of my statements in the last

, Pitt News.

In explaining the
Student Government on “the ,. ‘pos-
sible tuition hike, I was quoted as
having said: (‘We have to make
sure that all increased appropria-
tions we help the administration to"
get will go toward minimizing the
tuition increases and not raising
faculty salaries." The intent of
‘this’ statement was not clear.

. The. issue of increased state
appropriations is of mutual interest
to all branches of the University.
To suggest Student Government is
only concerned with tuition is a
mistake. Program cuts, increased
class size and inadequate salaries
for professors all directly affect the
quality . of education at this
University and are important to the

student populace as well ‘as to the '

faculty and administration.

_- ‘Although the Student Govern-
~..‘ment,wanf§.j;tQ“ insure thalt, ‘

Congress nor the American people
would stand for sending any kind of
manpower to Cambodia. In fact,
Congress is threatening right now
to cut all aid to Cambodia.”

“Well sir,-then this would be a
good time to chastise the Congress
for its continued cutting of our
defense budget. You could score
some points with the middle class
by pointing out if America had
been at her military peak, none of
this would have happened in the
first place.”

“Excuse me Mr. President, but
America was at her military peak
when we got ‘involved in Vietnam,
so I don’t think anyone would
believe that approach. I would
suggest we -remind the American
people of their commitments to
foriegn powers friendly to .us. We
could suggestthis is a key point‘ at
which to reverse our corroding

credibility. After all, it’s our
patriotic duty to support these
governments . ’ ’ '

“Gentlemen, I don’t think these
suggestions would work either.-

' There are_ those who argue the

Cambodian government is not
worthy of our support, that it is
corrupt and repressive.
many people have not even heard
of Cambodia. To the American
people, Lon No] is just Nol Lon

men, we need to come up with a
sweeping new policy, ‘one that will

get out to the press. It’s enough
they know I make my own

“Well sir, we could take a lesson
from the Middle East. I think our

send Henry on shuttles so everyone '
thinks we are trying to settle the
issues. At the same time, we send
arms and nuclear reactors to both

So everybody in the Middle East is
too confused to ﬁght a war, while
our arms industry makes a killing.
If that isn’t furthering the
American way, I don’t know what‘

simple. Start negotiations between
the "government forces and the

to both sides, thus opening the way
for good relations with whichever" —“

That way you could never be
accused of interfering in the affairs
of other countries. You will’ be

Jazz Concert in Review

Miles Davis: ‘Funky Rhythm’

BY B. LAMBL
Wandering around campus since
Monday night, I’ve picked up some
feedback on the Davis-Hancock

you are going to disagree with this
review.

For once I’m going to be out of the
black box from which 1 launch

be writing about a place you
haven't been yet, but about
common ground. And you'll be
able to see where I'm coming from,
where I've been coming from.
You'll be able to see, for one thing,
that I have strange tastes. No
apologies intended, I’m quite
happy with them. Only I hope they
don’t drive you away. If anything,
they ought to bring into sharp focus
your own attitudes about the

oncert.

‘*The difference in the audience’s
response to Davis and to Hancock
on Monday night was dramatic.

audience when Davis finished

People moved
into the aisles of the Syria Mosque
when the group started playing
“Spank-A-Lee,” Hancock's latest
release.

Hancock spiked that rhythm with
his playing on the synthesizer, the
clavinet and the Fender Rhodes.
He picked out hard electric tones
that transcribed the round drum
song into a more_jagged pattern.
He did most of his work on the
Fender Rhodes, and interjected
synthesizer effects for improvi-
sation. He is still shy with the

synthesizer, and when he gets up i

to play, he cocks his head over it
like a kid tentatively throwing
switches on an unfamiliar toy.

At_ one point, the electronic
improvisation dominated the rest of
the band, and the music moved
away from its organic rhythm. At

relate to. It took a Caribbean
rhythm slapped out on a beaded
gourd to woo back the audience.
Even then, the fusion of electric
and organic that characterized
Hancock's music was there. Bill
Summers cupped the gourd over
the microphone from time to time,
letting the waves inside the gourd
carry out through the amps.

If Hancock was body music, then
Miles Davis was body music plus.
Point of interest: Hancock used to
work with Miles Davis. It was
Davis who introduced him to the
synthesizer and who counted on
him to master it for his group.
When Hancock left, Davis got a
new keyboard man, but kept the
synthesizer for himself.

The trumpet and the synthesizer
seem like an odd combination for
one man to play. But Davis’s style
revealed/‘ their real affinity.

Davis used them sparsely. He
blasted spastic notes from the
trumpet, and interjected phrases
here and there on the synthesizer.

Its quality is unknown at this time.
Ask in a couple of weeks.
OK. So, tell me--why doesn’t
anybody care about Pitt baseball?
You got an hour? In a nutshell,
then; because hardly any students
stay around in the spring, because
the team is grotesquely under-
publicized, and because someone,
as aforementioned, is pulling an
egregious blunder by trying to
make the program disintegrate.
Disintegrate? That’s a pretty
strong word. Why do you say that?
Because the man keeps looking at
the baseball program like it’s a big
pimple; if he ignores it long
enough, maybe it'll go away.
Can't you be more speciﬁc?
Speciﬁcally, the football team
made a zillion, trillion dollars,
which is great. More power to
them (as if they really need it). But
some of the money should be
funneled into the baseball pro-
gram. .
What do you need with money?‘
Are you kidding? The team could

kicked-off theinew season yester-

day with a media luncheon at the .

Greentree Holiday Inn, and as
usual he expressed cautious
optimism regarding the upcoming
campaign. . _
“We could have a very exciting
year,” said Majors. “We have a

‘ lot of experience in the skilled

positions, but we are no cinch to be
a winner. This team could go
either way.”

The route the Cats will take won’t
be known for some time, but one
thing is certain--if the-Panthers are

to improve their 7-4 record of last ,

year, Majors and his staff will have
to ﬁll some mighty big holes.
‘Only 12 starters will be returning
from the 1974 squad, six on offense
and six on defense. Unfortunately,
,of the ten regulars lost through

graduation, eight of them could be .

considered mainstays of the squad.

Defensive standouts Gary Burley, ,

Glenn Hodge, Mike Bulino and
Kelcy Daviston will be missed
sorely, as will offensive stars Billy
Daniels, Bruce Murphy, Reynold
Stoner and Mike Carey.

Another complicating factor is the
lack of true leaders among the
remaining starters.
senior starters will be returning
and only ten seniors will be on the
entire spring roster. Defensive
back Dennis Moorhead, defensive
end Tom Perko and wide receiver
Karl Farmer will be needed to
supply some much-needed charac-
ter to next year’s team.

“This is the smallest contingent of
seniors I’ve had in my 18 years of

In NFL

Only three V

coaching college football,” said
Majors. “We had outstanding
senior leadership last year and we
need some people to step to the
front and take their place.”

But leaders'aren’t the only ones

.Majors will be searching for. There

are glaring holes in both the
offensive and the defensive units.
Possibly the biggest is at the
quarterback slot. O-nly Bob
Haygood, a junior from Atlanta,
has taken a snap as a varsity
quarterback, and his playing time
at the position has been extremely
limited.

There is only inexperience behind
Haygood. Sophomores Matt
Cavanaugh, Mark O"I-‘oole, Dave
Migliore and Dave=DiCiccio all will
be given a shot at the starting job,
but right now Haygood has to be
considered the leading candidate.
.“At quarterback it y will -be
Haygood and youth,” noted

- Majors. “Bob has done a great job

for us, retu1;ning kick-offs- and
backing up Billy Daniels and Bobby
Medwid at quarterback. He’s also
done a good jobbacking up the
basketball program.”

“I think the basketball experience
has helped him,” he continued.
“He’s‘played in some big games in
pressure situations and in front of
some big crowds. I think that it has
helped build up his confidence, and
confidence is an important thing to
have in football.”

The offensive line also is going to
be’ a problem and could cause
Majors and Offensive Line Coach
Joe Avezzano many sleepless
nights. Three of the ﬁve starters
from a year ago will be departing
and only Tom Brzoza and Joe Stone
will be back to block for Pitt’s super
running backs, Fortunately, some
help could be” on the way from

several top-notch line recruits-

reporting in August.

, At running back and receiver

slots--the so-called skilled positions
--Pitt appears to be in great shape.
Farmer and'tight end Jim _.Corbett
had ﬁne seasons last year, with a
combined total of 34 receptions for
487 yards and ﬁve touchdowns.
But they will not have their
positions locked up this spring,
because wide receivers Willie
Taylor and Rodney Clark and tight
end Jinx Johnson will be challeng-
ing them for the starting, nod.

Experience and talent abounds at ‘

running ‘back. Tony Dorsett, a
two-time All-American, will return

_, .

in search of his third straight
1,000-yard season. Freshman
Elliott Walker, who gained 431
yards last season on a limited
basis, should ‘provide plenty of
assistance. Starting fullback Bob
Hutton (4.8 yards per carry last ,
season) also will return to theff
squad. Laverga Walker (Elliott's
brother), Willie Walker and Curtis
Smith also could see some action.

However, the eligibility of the
Walker brothers is still somewhat
in doubt. It is_quite possible that
the two Florida natives will be
ruled ineligible by the NCAA on
the grounds they enlisted a private
attorney to represent them in
future professional negotiations.

“The Walker brothers will start
practice,” stated Majors. “Their
case is still under consideration,
but the fact they will be practicing V
is, Ithink, a positive point. It’s a
very technical case but I'm totally
optimistic aboutsthe situation at -
this time.” -

On the other side of the
scrimmage line, Majors will have to
compensate for the loss of Hodge,
Burley and defensive back David
Spates. At present, there are no
clear-cut solutions to the problem
of who will ﬁll the holes. Majors
will need more time to evaluate the
capabilities of his returning defen-
sive squad members.

Pitt will go against perhaps the
toughest schedule since Majors
took over the helm and it could be
one of the toughest inthe history of
the University. The team will open
the season at Georgia and then will
travel to Norman, Oklahoma to
meet the powerful Oklahoma
Sooners, just about everybody’s
pre-season pick for national cham-
pfon. . , _ 

The Cats will close out the season
with two equally tough opponents
in. Notre Dame and Penn State.
However, there is some talk of a 7
schedule change in the works that~<'.’-.'5_,3;
would make the. Notre Dame I
contest the -season opener, enabl-
ing Pitt to pick up a sizable chunk
of cash from national television
coverage.

So with the caliber of the
opposition and the number of holes
to ﬁll, the future of the Pitt football
team is still questionable.
Nevertheless, the squad can be
expected to be at least competitive,
if not downright outstanding.‘ But‘; \ . 
as Majors put it, “We need some. '
people to come to the front.” \

  Rules change Ridiculous  

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

The National Football‘ League
club owners, those innovators and
renovators of _ the great game of
football, have‘ struck again. In the
interest of giving needed assist-
ance to the poor offensive players,
thebig wheels have adopted eight
new rule changes.

The biggest change is designed to
increase the number of TD’s inside
the 20 yard line. Instead of» bring-
ing an incomplete. passon fourth

down back to _the 20, it will be

placed at the linetof scrimmage.

Have youcgot that exciting news,
sports fans? The reasoning behind
the huge modiﬁcation is most
teams are scared on fourth down
and would opt for a ﬁeld goal try
rather than risk a pass.

This rule was designed to help the
offense but I don’t get it. For
example, you are on the one yard
line on fourth down. You try a pass.
If you miss, the other team takes
overon the one. Who does the rule
.he1pf§:,the',.t_e_a' K 4 '

  
   
 

    
   
     

" .ho=-:tal<?é'S}‘ V9.13“ 0,11 9 I / :;Th§»:-f 

the one or the squad that blew the
TD but has its opponent in a hole?
You ﬁgure it out.

Remember last_ year during the
playoffs when powerhouse .Min-
nesota, with Kansas City and
Oakland, put 15“ men I in its
defensive huddle to confuse the
offense? Well, that ridiculous bit of
smart coaching, which didn’t con-
fuse anyone but the spectator, has
been -done away with by the

. owners. Any delay caused by extra».
. men on the field‘ will result in a 15
V yard penalty.*Any-man who enters

must stay for at least oneplay.

Another big . change applies to
rare. instances when ‘defensivezg
holding is called behind the line of
scrimmage. The penalty will now
be marked off from the line" of
scrimmage instead of from the spot
of the foul. I don’t think the penalty
will exactly curtail holding, but it
was a nice try.

Of the eight changes, . two are

' attention-getters only becausethey
_ re so __r_idiculous...  2 a '

  
  
      

piece of ‘equipment on the ﬁeld of
play--the field markers. From now _
on all markers must be approvedby
King Peter Rozelle, Lord of all the
land. Each team also will be
required to use standard-sized [no
more substandard] line markers
and pylons instead of cloth ﬂags for
end zone markers.

What is the difference if sideline
markers are regulation size? Why
should they be one size? Who
cares? .
..But-./the best rule change..,of all
concerns ball boys. Youknow who

«-

' ‘V theyare, that great bunch of guys

that bring fresh’ balls to the ref-
during rain, snow, sleet or hail‘.
These important people must, until
further notice, “now be uniformly
identiﬁed." -
There it is, ladies and gentlemen“
you've heard it from the top. From
now on all you ball boys will have to
get together before game time and
pickout identical wardrobes. -Per-

/"R,

Miles Davis: ‘Funky Rhythm ’

(Continued from Page 5)

he moved through the improvisa-
tions. That was his control. No
matter how far he went, there was
always the bottom anchoring the
body, soothing the lost listener.
With the tie made, he spun out on a
head trip.

 ‘On the synthesizer, he pitched in

some Gothic chords that developed
into a theme evil. He let the
Congas, the bass and the electric
piano fill in the meat of the
phrases, but when they began to
soften, he hit them again with a
dramatic chord or a hysterical set of
trumpet bleats. He did not let
them slide back into the base
rhythm, but drove them harder to
explore the unyielding music line.

It was beginning to sound like a

horror movie when, without a break .

or transition or identification, he
called out the flute and moved into
a more melodic theme. The form
might have been different but the

1729 Murray Ave./421-1633

\‘1

idea was still the same. This time it
was the flowers of evil. Gradually,
Davis drew out the latent hostility
in the languid song. The flute
melody turned snide, the rhythm
prowling and the bass pulsating.
There’d been no change; Davis was
just developing his material from a
different angle. It seemed like a
perverse fixation with him. The
revelation climaxed with a cat yowl
from the synthesizer.

That was his signal for the third »

change. The melody disintegrated
into imitative noises, disconnected
jungle sounds. It was the purge.
The band relocated the original
rhythm, stressing the primordial
aspect as an alternative to the evil.

Before he stuck out his
tongue and walked off stage, he'd
said, “If you don't get it. up for
yourself, ain't nobody going to get
it up for you." -
