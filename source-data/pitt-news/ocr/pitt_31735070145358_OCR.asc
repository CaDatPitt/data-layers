The highest—ranking military officer
in the nation told a crowd gathered
in Oakland yesterday that they can
playacrucial role inhelpingwounded
soldiers adjust back into civilian life.

Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman
of thejoint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to an
audience of aboutzoo people duringa
town hall meeting in the Soldiers and
Sailors’ auditorium.

The event opened with awelcome
by Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. He
recognized and thanked each of the
eightpanelists of “veterans and those
who are devoting their lives to the de—
livery of services to veterans.”

Mullen then spoke for about 10
minutes about the role the commu-
nity plays in welcoming soldiers back
home, gettingthem back on their feet
after suffering physical and mental
wounds and in comforting theirfami—
lies, who according to Mullen often
suffer from their loved ones’ wounds
almost as much as the injured soldiers
do.

“It is very important to articulate
that the Department of Defense and
the [United States Department of
Veterans Affairs] can’t do this alone,”_
Mullen said. “The third piece is com-
munity.”

He said he believes there is a “sea of
goodwill out there” ——— alarge popula-
tion of community members across
the United States, and particularly in
Pittsburgh, who want to help veterans
adjust to returning home. He said he
thought more would volunteer to help
these wounded veterans if they were
less shy or knew how to help.

Some of the panelists agreed that
able veterans should show community
members how they can help because

each soldier’s situation and wound
is different. Mullen said he chose
Pittsburgh to address in a town hall
meeting because Pitt is known for
its relationship with the military and
veterans and conducts much ofthe re-
searchthatisnecessaryforbetterrnent
of the  Examples he gave are
technology of the visually impaired,
hand implants and entertainment
technology, which is similar to video
games for the preparation and reha-
bilitation of soldiers serving in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

‘ Mullen and the panelists stressed
the issue ofhomelessness of veterans.

Awayto avoidthis is, again, to encour—'

age community members to reach out
and offer their services. Retired Sgt.

Jeremy W. Feldbusch, the national
spokesman of the Wounded Warrior
Project, suggested working one-on-
one with veterans to get them back
to civilian life, in school or a job and
in homes. Feldbusch was blinded by
shrapnel as a soldier.

Panelists also brieﬂy discussed the
relationship between veterans and
their children and ways of adjusting
together and the PittsburghVA Medi-
cal Center’s recognition for women
veterans’ care. .

“We really try to make it one-stop
shopping for women veterans,” said
Terry Gerigk Wolf, director and chief
executive officer of the VA Pittsburgh
Healthcare System.

Nick Bosch, aPitt sophomore spe-
cializing in emergency medicine and
an Air Force ROTC member, attended
with a handful" of his friends in their
crisp blue uniforms. ROTC members
were not required to attend the ad-
dress, but Bosch felt honored to.

“Any opportunity to hear a lead-
er, especially in the military, speak is
good,” Bosch said. “It makes [his expe-
rience with the military] more real.”

City taken to court
oversubpoena

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

A watchdog organization is asking a judge
why the city police chief sh0uldn’t beheld
in contempt of court for refusing to hand
over G-20 documents.

Beth Pittinger:

We’re going to
follow throughrwith
this, of course.      

The Citizen Police Review Board ﬁled
a motion in court last week tohave the
city, speciﬁcally Chief of Police Nathan
Harper, say why it should not be held in
contempt of court for refusing to produce
documents a court order required it to
give to the CPRB. -

Should the city be found in contempt
for refusing to hand over the documents,
it would be ﬁned $500 initially and $100

per day after that for not complying with ,

the CPRB'subpoena by April 7.

Allegheny Countyjudge R. Stanton Wet-
tick Jr. ruled on March 18 that the city
had to give the CPRB copies of its G-20
documents within 20 days or state why
they were protected under law. '

The city filed an appeal to the Com-

monwealth Court April 7, the deadline for
handing over documents. ‘

Questions for Harper were referred to
City solicitor Dan Regan, who declined
to comment on the possibility of Harper
being held in contempt of court.

Harper refused to give the CPRB G—20
—related documents in January, when it
sent the city police a subpoena for the
paperwork. The city’s representatives said
in court that the CPRB could not initiate
its own investigation. ,

Beth Pittinger, executive director of .

the CPRB, said the board will continue to
push for the G-20 documents. ,
“We’re going to follow through with

this, of course,” she "said. ..  _-

Regan said in a statement yesterday
that the G—20 Summit caused the city to A

review the powers of the reviewboard.

Wettick said in his March ruling that
a city ordinance give the CPRB the power
to initiate its own investigations into the
police. ' ’

the CPRB said the board must advise the
mayor and chief of police on police recruit-
ment, training and disciplinaryipolicies,

‘according to court documents.

Wettick said this ordinance can only
be enforced if the CPRB can investigate
police conduct without having received
speciﬁc complaints, as was the case with

‘the G—20.

The state court docket did not contain a
date for the appeal, and only saidthe case
was “awaiting original documents.”

Urban fleamarket o

Students, locals peruse sundries from 240 vendors

Jenelle Pifer
For The Pitt News

A new ﬂea market opened in the Strip District
Sunday, 17 years after Pittsburgh’s only large-
scale, ﬂea market closed.

Whenjanis Surman, alongtime ﬂea market
enthusiast, noticed that Pittsburgh lacked a
central urban market, she began to feel an itch.
Laid oﬂ' from her corporate job of 17 years with
AT&T, Surman spent 12 months unemployed,

facing a poor job market with few prospects.
And soon, the itch that ﬁrst only tickled her
imagination began to consume her morning,
noon and night.

“It was just something that started to grow
in my mind, and ﬁnally it got to the point where
Ithought, ‘You know, Ithinkl canpull this off,”’
Surman said.

Within months, the Pittsburgh Flea was
born. ‘ A

Sunday, Surman held the ﬁrst Pittsburgh

Flea, an eclectic market featuringawide range of
used and new items, between 21st and Railroad
streets in the Strip District. The Pittsburgh Flea
will occur weekly, every Sunday between 8 am.

and 3 p.m., through Nov. 14. _ .

Despite the weekend’s gray skies and 38-
degree drizzle, shoppers came in swarms to the
previously empty lot off Smallmanstreet.

Early that morning, a woman bundled in
a Windbreaker hunched over a table. “I know
I’In kooky, but I justlike it!” she said, gigglingas

pens in Strip District

— she picked up _a ceramic containerwith a naked ‘

woman bejeweled on the lid.
Surman’s project took off last August when

A she approached Neighbors in the Strip, a com-

munity development organization in the Strip
District The organization connected Surman
with local businesses and referred potential

vendors, hoping to bring new visitors to the A

area. . . V
“It’s going to bring a totally different dy-

namic to the Strip District,” said Becky Rodgers, .

executive director of Neighbors in the Strip. “So
hopeﬁilly when they’re down here visiting the
ﬂea market, they’ll stroll over to the rest of the

Strip — have some beer at Roland’s or breakfast ’_

at Pamela’s.”- T .

For Surman, the Strip was the, obvious
venue. It’s city-centric, has the space to ac-
commodate the project and people already go
there to mingle and peruse, she said.

As Surman and Rhodes advertised the proj-
ect via word of mouth, the itch quickly began
to spread. . V i

L For Sunday’s event Surman conﬁrmed 240
vendors, the maximum the area could hold,
and had a waiting list of 40 more. Not all con-
firmed vendors participated Sunday dueto poor
weather conditions, but the quirky spread of
items for sale did not disappoint.

The Pittsburgh Flea isn’t just a bunch of .

“ﬂea-sters” grabbing up “used and bruised

’ ' items from somebody’s garage,” Surman said.

“I wanted it to be a little edgy.”

The market featured a“ diverse mix of new
and old, bizarre and mundane and included
antiques, original art and collectibles. There

. were organic soaps and lotions, homemade

dog biscuits, African textiles, Star Wars comic

books, vintage bow ties, mosaic pottery, jewelry

made from silverware and soy candles. This

_’ list goes on.

The majority of the vendors were local, but

T some came from as far as New York state and 7

Virginia. Some sellers will rotate weekly, and
others will anchor tables summer long.

In a time of economic difficulty, budget-
conscious customers can bargain and haggle
and ﬁnd items at discounted prices. “People feel
better about that,” Surman said. “I thinkit gives
them a little bit of psychic income as well.”

And for Pittsburgh’s always frugal student
population, the ﬂea market could prove worth-
while for its varied mix of inexpensive wares

' and its low~cost entertainment value.

“It runs until 3 p.m. so you don’t have to get
up early. Also, it’s right in the Strip, which is a
ﬁm neighborhood to explore,” Anna Kahler,
a junior neurosciencemajor at Pitt, said. She,
alongwith junior Chris -Brett, is part of Su_rman’s‘
small ﬂea market staff. -
- “This is a great way for students to decorate
their rooms or apartments, ﬁnd interesting

and eclectic ‘pieces that you don’t see in every

Target, and also it’s a great place to spend a
Sunday morning,” Rhodes said. “You can be

hung over, and you can get some greasy food,’_’ '

she laughed.

sors might brush that [program] off. He would -

just laugh and make the best of it,” Eng said.

He said he and his classmates did simula-
tions every other week in Shastri’s class. They
would perform a simulation one week and turn
in a paper about it the next. _ '

“You got to learn a lot more than buying
low and selling high,” Eng said, referring to a
common mantra in the trading profession.
“Compared to other professors, Ithink that he
was a lot more involved in letting the students
get their hands dirty. He really wanted you to _
learn from doing things.” .

Eng said he would consult Shastri when
he was trying to decide which stocks to buy,
and Shastri would always provide him with
solid yet unconventional advice.

“We would look at the P/E ratio, and I
would never consider things like that,” Eng
said, referring to a market principal that
tracks whether a company is turning over
its inventory and making money.

Eng said he couldn’t remember where
Shastri acquired his knowledge of the mar-
ket. V

. “I don’t think he ever talked about his per~
sonal 1ife,” Eng said. V

Shastri was born in India in 1954. He
earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical
engineering from the Indian Institute of
Technology in New Delhi in 1975. He earned
his MBA from the Katz Graduate School of
Business in 1976 and his doctorate in ﬁnan-
cial economics from the Anderson School of

Management at the University of California,

Los Angeles, in 1982;
' He published morethan 40 articles in

peer—reviewed journals from 1981 to 2098.

He began teaching at Pitt in 1981 as avis-
iting lecturer and was named the Roger S.
Ahlbrandt Sr." Endowed Chair in Finance in
2000.

Shastri’s wife, Karen, is an associate pro-
fessor forthe Katz Graduate School of Busi-
ness. She described him as a “brilliant scholar,‘
wonderful cook and a wonderful father.”

Kuldeep Shastri created a webpage for
himself ’on»Pitt’s site. Under the “Personal
Page” section of his site, he wrote that he was
“pretty good” at cooking and enjoyed watching
sports, “especially anything that involves the
Pittsburgh Penguins, the Pittsburgh Pirates,
the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Pittsburgh
Panthers and the UCLA Bruins.”

EDITORIAL‘

Report deserves
follow-up studies

ome college students about
S to graduate into the reces—

sion might look for any
blip of newsfrom Pittsburgh’s
job market to satisfy their aching
fears of impending joblessness.

If your situation seems simi-
lar, take it slow.

Be careful not to take more
from what you’ve read recently
than is reasonable, especially
when you read that the city’s
young workers are among the
best educated. It might mean
good things for Pittsburgh’s fu-

ture, but the observation alone‘

doesn’t allow you to conclude
your job is already secured.
The Pittsburgh Economic
Quarterly reported last week
that Pittsburgh boasts one of

the nation’s most educated young *

workforces. .

According to Christopher
Briem, the report author who
examined 2009 surveys from the
U.S. Census Bureau, the propor-
tion of Pittsburgh workers aged
25 to 3'4 with bachelor degrees
or higher ranks ﬁfth among 40
metropolitan workforces.

A_s Boston leads the country
with 56 percent, Pittsburgh tops
New York and Philadelphiawith
its 48 percent.

Looking at the concentration
of graduate—level degrees in that
age group, Pittsburghranks high-
est among the 40 cities.

Also according tolthe study,
a smaller percentage of Pitts-
burgh’s young workforce is with-
out a high school diploma than
that of any other city.

In an indirect sense, the news
bodes well for the city’s future,
especially if the city continues
to attract educated young work-
ers. ‘

Scholars have long associ-
ated education with societal
beneﬁts. _

It’s not only Pittsburgh’s Jef-
fersonian ideal of democracy that
could beneﬁt (i.e., an educated
city spawns educated voters).

Over- time, regions with highly
educated workforces ﬁnd wage

increases for all workers, accord- .

ing to a report from Arizona State
University’s 2005 Productivity
and Prosperity Project.

In addition, the Project notes
that by increasing the concentra-
tion of college degrees among
the labor force, a region lowers
crime rates and social services
expenditures, while improving
civic participation and personal
health. '

It’s clear that regardless of
what produced Pittsburgh’s sub-
stantial proportion of college
degrees —;whether it was the
large number of postsecondary

schools in the city or movements -

of less educated workers to other
areas — an educated future is a

- bright one.

But what’s uncertain from
Briem’s study is how recent and
soon—to—be graduates will fare
pursuing their ﬁrst jobs.

For the study to be meaning-
ful for these graduates, a central
question deserves an answer: Are
they indeed getti_ng jobs?

More specifically, has Pitts-
burgh’s well—educated young
workforce retained enough jobs
during the recession for upper-
classmen to look at the local
market with justified hope? Do
the retained jobs require degrees
in anything otherthan technical
ﬁelds?

As Pittsburgh Regional Alli-
ance vice president of market
research Jim Futrell indicates,
business success over the past
two years was limited mainly to
the engineering, architecture
and financial services sectors.

Research has yet to investi-
gate such questions, but until
it does, students shouldn’t fill
themselves with potentially false
hope.

It’s not enough to say educat-
ed young workers exist. It’s more
to say Pittsburgh businesses can
pay them. -

MOVIE PREVIEW

Union to screen Pitt student’s indie film

Pitt senior Tom Getty will show his low—budget ‘Emulation’ in the Assembly Room on Wednesday.

EVENT REVIEW

. ‘ Courtesy Tom‘ Getty
Pitt senior Tom Getty not only wrote, but also starred in his ﬁrst full-length ﬁlm “Emulation.”

Noah Levinson
Staﬂ” Writer

Tom Getty would hang out the win-
dow of a car going 90 mph to achieve
his dreams, and in his ﬁrst full-length
movie, “Emulation,” that’s just what
he had to do. ‘

For an elaborate chase scene
on the parkway, Getty, a Pitt senior
communication major from John-
stown, Pa., getting the right shot
required sticking his body out of a

M ' car and dangling his camera 9 inches

off the pavement.

“I almost fell out of the car,”
Getty said. “I wouldn’t want to do
that again.” .

But there isn’t much that Getty
wouldn’t do to ﬁnish his ﬁlm, which
will show in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room Wednesday starting
at 7:30 p.m. _

“Emulation,” a project Getty has
been working on for the past two
years, revolves around one man and
a company that recreates the experi-
ence of living through a movie.

“Say you want to live through ‘Die
Hard.’ They’ll put you in a building
with pyrotechnics and music play-
ing, with guys in ski masks shooting
blanks,” Getty said.

The idea came from Getty wait-
ingthrough the previews in 2007 for
the movie “Death Sentence” when a
trailer for the George Clooney thrill-
er “Michael Clayton” played.

Getty was immediately hooked
— sort of. c

“I thought that would be pretty
terrible to live _in a movie, but it
would be a neat company to have,”
Getty said. “I thought I could do
something with that.”

' After transferring from Pitt’s

Johnstown campus to Oakland,
Getty spent a year ﬁlming the movie
on the weekends, usually only three
hours per weekend because of his
friends? busy schedules.

Even for Getty, the change of life
between movie world and real world
was demanding. _

“Between school, ﬁlming, editing
and this upcoming sneak peek, it’s
tough switching gears constantly,”
Getty said.

The ﬁlm takes place inPittsburgh
and includes many scenes in and
around Pitt’s campus. _

At ﬁrst, Getty worried about
bringing a prosumer video camera
around campus and the attention it
might draw. ‘ '

“As ubiquitous as cameras are
today, no one wants to be on ﬁlm,”

Awash with Tosh: TV comedian deals the funny

Comedy Central’s Daniel Tosh delivered authentic comedy last night in the Union.

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A&E Editor

Sometimes when comedian Dan-
iel Tosh starts talking, he just

- can’t stop —— but no one who at-

tended last night’s performance
in the William Pitt Union seemed

to mind at all.

Tosh’s Pitt Program Council-
sponsored performance went on
for 90 hilarious minutes, and de-
spite going over his scheduled
time by half an hour, Tosh fully
engaged the audience from start
to ﬁnish. _

After an amusing opening

act from Matt Fulchiron, Tosh
marched onstage wearing his
typical uniform ofjeans, a T-
shirt, sneakers and of course one
of his many, many cardigans that
he is so well known for. _
The popular comedian and
host of Comedy Central’s hit
show “Tosh.o” took on typical

stand-up topics like his girl-
friend, politics, gender and race
but also ﬁred a few verbal shots
at the Founding Fathers, the Win-
ter Olympics, Mormons and a few
recent tragedies in the news.
Despite the topics, Tosh’s
performance didn’t quite tum-
ble over the line of sensitivity ——

though he certainly ﬂirted with
it. But just like on “Tosh.0,” his
smooth delivery and likable per-
sonality were his saving graces
that let him get a little edgier
than most.

. In actuality, the entire per-
formance was likean extended
special of the show, without the

TECHNOLOGY TUESDAY

After FCC ruling, net
neutralityin peril  

 
 

Donald Campbell
Columnist

If you were to ask the average Internet user
about net neutrality, you might get a sur-
prising answer.

Net neutrality is a concept that dictate-s
completely equal treatment of all Web con-
tent by Internet service providers. Without
it, service providerscould restrict or ob-
struct access to certain content.

Many people would stare blankly at the
mention of net neutrality.

Others would assure you that net neu- I

trality was’ an inherent feature of the market
and that Internet service providers could
never begin restricting access in fear of a
mass exodus by customers. , .

_ It might not yet be doomsday, but recent
developments have called into question the
existence of true net neutrality in today’s
broadband Internet marketplace.

The trouble began around April 7.

Th_e Washington Post reported that
a federal appeals court ruled in favor of
Comcast in a lawsuit against the Federal
Communications Commission. v

The FCC had previously exercised what it
thought was its regulatory power and sanc-
tioned Comcast when Comcast slowed ac-
cess to a BitTorrent ﬁle-sharing website.

Comcast said its slowing of access was
a tactic to reduce network traffic caused
by the transfer of large ﬁles through Bit-
Torrent.

The court ruled that the FCC did not.

have suflicient oversight powers to enforce
net neutrality. .

This may not be initially alarming. After
all, the FCC lost a case speciﬁcally with
Comcast. Customers can easily go to an-
other service provider, right?

It depends on where you live.

_ According to the Washington Post’s
follow-up article, 78 percent of Americans
have access only to two broadband Internet
service providers in their area. Thirteen
percent are subject to monopolies. Only

nine percent have access to three broad-
band ISPs. - . '

If the FCC is no longer legally able to
sanctioncompanies into net neutrality,

. there’s no guarantee that Americans will

have the available choices to pressure com-
panies through the free market.

Both articles suggest a series of actions
that could be taken to prevent the large ISPs
from restricting access.

Congress could, of course, enact laws
that overturn the court’s decision, and ex-
plicitly give the FCC_‘the power. to enforce
net neutrality. ; _ '  _ A

This might be difﬁcult,j‘hoi/vever, as hav-
ing more government regulation is cur-
rently far from popular. _ e

The FCC could also reverse a decision
from the days when the service providers
only provided landline telephone. I

Back in the day, communications com-

panies were forced to open their physical _

infrastructure to others. In the days of dial-
up' Internet and DSL, this created a market
full of small up-and-start providers, giving
customers a healthy amount of choice. This
concept was known as line sharing.

The FCC exempted broadband providers
from line sharing by classifying them as
“information services,” a new category.

If the FCC were to reverse this reclas-
siﬁcation, it could stimulate the growth of
smaller providers and allow the free market
to pressure companies into net neutral-
ity.

As it stands now, however, the primary
regulator keeping the world of broadband
service approximately fair has been re-
moved from the‘ equation.

Comcast, according to the Washington‘ A

Post, stopped its use of speed reductions
to reduce network trafﬁc. This does not
guarantee, however, that speed reductions
will not crop up in the future.‘

-The congressional route might ultimate-

‘ ly prove to be the solution for net neutrality .

advocates.

Congress has attempted to, pass net neu-
trality legislation. Any legislation might
have to wait until after the midterm elec-
tions or until other highly contentious bills
are no longer on‘the table.

But inhabitants of a few lucky, cities
could avoid this. Companies like Google are

holding contests to decide which American .

city should be provided with high-speed
wireless access.

For the lucky city or cities chosen, the
marketplace will not only increase by one

‘ provider, but Google’s stated commitment

to open information exchange might force
the existing carriers to think twice before
violating net neutrality. '

Today’s difficulty level: Easy

Sold—0ut crowd satisfied  

Tosh < 8

Daniel Tosh sported one of his infamous

Luc Felakl SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
cardigans last night at his performance in the
- William Pitt Union.

Web redemptions and mildly disturbing
YouTube videos. i '

‘He interacted well with the audience
and oddly enough, the stage itself. Over the
course of the performance heattempted
ﬂight by jumping off the stage, picked up a
pen and a hairpin he found and asked if the
ramp were actually a bridge to Terabithia.

His improvisation made» it obvious that
even off the stage, Tosh is a pretty funny
guy, which overall made the show feel a
lot more authentic.- _.

His openingwas a bit intentionally
awkward before he got into the real jokes,
but all in all the sold—out crowd wasn’t
disappointed. '

Getty<8

Getty said. ' -
But eventually, the setting truly paid off.
‘_‘It’s like a playground around Oakland to

make an action movie,” Getty said, running

off his list of locations, including Posvar Hall, .

escalators, buses and the parkway. A

Of course, Getty couldn’t complete “Emula—
tion” by himself. His friend from high school,
Matt Meehan, assisted the shoot as director
of photography. S

Meehan, a 25-year-old graduate of Penn
State living in Johnstown, Pa., works mostly
on indie work in the Pittsburgh area. ’

“It was a lot of work,” Meehan said of his ‘

time working on “Emulation.” “The biggest
challenge was working with no budget; shoot-
ing in locations with no budget, looking for
people to work with no budget.”

But Getty said he feels that a big budget
isn’t needed to make a movie.

“You don’t need a million dollars. You don’t
need to go out to LA. Whatever you have, that’s

what you put into the movie,” Getty said. “W '

had a car. We have a car chase.” . '

_ With minimal funds for advertising, Getty .

Carchase Without budget  

hopes word of mouth  be his b_est market-

. ing campaign for “Emulation.” From there, he

hopes to acquire an agent and send it through
festivals, eventually praying, like every inde-
pendent ﬁlmmaker, for a distributor to step
in. "
But ﬁlmmaking has been in" Getty’s heart
for quite some time. ‘ ..
' Since ‘age 8, he enjoyed writing anything

he could. Soon he received a camera and went

straight to making movies.
Getty cites directors Christopher Nolan,

Martin Scorsese and David Fincher as some V

of his personal inﬂuences, emphasizing their
masteries of the concepts of fear and time.

Finally, though, after editing 10 hours of
footage into an 84-minute ﬁlm, Getty will get
the chance to see his ﬁlm fulﬁll its purpose:
Keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

But that doesn’t.mean Getty himself is ﬁ-
nally fulﬁlled. ,

From “Emulation” alone, he learned more
than he thought possible. I

“You realize you know nothing, and you
will learn everything.”

Gunn can only recall the play be-

~ “The nextthingIcanrememberis,I

where I can’t remember anything.”

' He sat out the restof that season,

“You would think that his career

coach for the past two seasons, said.
“You saw what his passion was and
what the game meant for him.”

Eventually, Gurm was granted a
sixthyearof eligibility. He participated
in spring practice before last season
butwasn’t cleared forfull contactuntil
the summer.

It was diﬂicult for Gunn, who said
hitting is one of his favorite aspects of
football, but once he was cleared for
takedown, he had no time to.be ten-

, tative. - ‘
“Everyone elseputmore emphasis .

out there on the ﬁeld, you don’t have

"time to think, ‘Oh, I broke my neck. I

can’t hit thatguy.’ The gamejust moves
too fast.” ‘

Gurm ﬁnished his senior season
third on the team in tackles (77), third
in sacks (5.0) and sixth in tackles fora

BASEBALL RECAP

Pitt sweeps Villanova,
tied for 3rd in Big East

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt baseball team continued its domi-

nance of the Big East this weekend as the

Panthers swept Villanova. ‘
Pitt (26-9, 9-3 Big East) returned from

Philadelphia with three more wins as it‘

dismantled the Wildcats (19-14, 2-10 Big
East).

- Pitt outscored the Wildcats 25-15 during
the sweep and currently boasts a lineup of
players who each sport a batting average of
at least .320. . r -

“We have — swung the bats well,” head
coach Joe Jordano said. “All of our hitters
understood our plan, and Coach Lopaze and
Coach Leahy have down a great j ob ensuring
that our guys have understood that message
and work at it everyday.”

Joe Jordano:

On Friday, the No. 24-ranked Panthers
won 8-5 thanks to the offensive leadership
of shortstop Danny Lopez and catcher Corey
Brownsten. Each went 3-for-5 at the plate,
drove in a run and scored one.

Pitt trailed 4-_2 entering the fourth inning
after the Wildcats exploited starting pitcher
Corey Baker early in the game. i

But Pitt exploded for four runs in the
fourth inning to take a lead that they would
never relinquish. Villanova starting pitcher

- Brian Streilein gave up two doubles, a single

and a walk all before the ﬁrst out.

Villanova used a sacriﬁce ﬂy to pull
within a run in the seventh, but Pitt put the
game away with two runs of its own in the
eighth. , A

Baker recovered from a shaky start to
earn his eighth win of the year. He pitched
seven innings, giving up ﬁve runs on 10 hits.
Pitcher _].R. Leonardi-ﬁnished out the last

' two innings to earn his third save.

On Saturday, the Panthers overcame a

bad defensive performance to. clinch the
series victory with a 12-7 win. '

Pitt was led by centerﬁelder Zach Duggan, I A

catcher Kevan Smith and starting pitcher
Matt Iannazzo. Duggan went 4-for-5 with

' three RBIs, Smith went 3-for-5, scoring three

times, and Iannazzo went six innings and
allowed ﬁve runs, only two of which were
earned. ' A
The Panthers struck ﬁrst whenjoe Leon-
ard scored on a.Chester groundout in the
ﬁrst inning. Villanova took the lead with two

1 unearned runs in the third due to an error

by "right ﬁelder Philip Konieczny.

But then Pitt regained the lead with two
runsiin the fourth and one in the sixth, which
were the result of Villanova errors.

In the seventh, Duggan and Schultz
singles were sandwiched around a Lopez

double that brought in two more runs. When ,
. Iannazzo failed to retire the ﬁrst two ‘batters .

in the seventh, Leonardi replaced him. He
committed an error that led to two more
unearned runs. - _

But Pitt put the game away with six runs
in the ﬁnal two innings. Iannazzo registered
the win to improve to 6-1', and Leonardi
picked another save by pitching the ﬁnal
two and two-thirds innings and giving up
only two runs. '

In the ﬁnal game of the series, _the Pan-
thers were able to overcome an early two-run

deﬁcit to win 5_-3 thanks to the bat of second

baseman Travis Whitmore.

2 Whitmore hit his ﬁrst two homeruns of
the year, a three-run shot and a solo, in the
fourth and sixth innings to give Pitt all of
the runs they needed. . .

Pitt scored an "insurance run in the sev-
enth when Lopez scored on a passed ball.

Pitcher Cole Taylor played ﬁve innings, giv- .

ing up two runs on ﬁve hits. Taylor struck
out six on his way to improving his record
to 3-0. Ray Black retired the last batter of
the game to get the save.

The Panthers take a break from confer-
ence action to host Kent State today at 3
p.m. and then travel to Youngstown State
tomorrow for another 3 p.m. matchup. Pitt
will jump back into Big East play with the
Backyard Brawl: Baseball Edition this week-
end at West Virginia. ’

Pitt’s 9-3 Big East record is good enough
for a tie with Louisville for.third in the Big
East, while Connecticut and Rutgers are tied
atop the conference standingsat 10-2. Pitt
has already played Rutgers and Louisville,
going 1-2 and 2-1 respectively, and the Pan-
thers will play_ Connecticut May 1-2 at Trees
Field. . V '

“Our expectation is to play every inning

— of every remaining game with great passion

and intensity. Period,” jordano said.

THE LITTMAN TEST

Ortiz’s reputation falling like batting average“?

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

SomeonecallManny Ramirez, because
David Ortiz needs ahug. V

It’s been a rough year or so for the
Red Sox slugger, who won over base-
ballfans withhis infectious smile, brute
power and pre—batting routine of spit-
ting in each hand, then clapping. It’s
more charmingthan it sounds.

But now Ortiz has come crashing
down almost as quickly as his batting
average. V ,

We’ll start back onjuly 30, 2009,
when The New York Times published
anarticle sayingortiztestedpositivefor
perfonnance-enhancingdrugsin2003.
He was an unthreatening designated
hitter for the Twins from 1997-2002,
never hitﬁng more than20 homeruns
in one season. Then in 2003, he went
to Boston and hit 31 homertms. Then
he hit 41 the next season, 47 after that
and54in2006. Hispastthree homerun
totals — 35, 23 and28 — haven’tbeen
as high, but they’re still morethan he
ever hit in Minnesota. .

Realistically, a story about a great
baseball player testing positive for

steroids at some point in the past two
decades isn’t shocking. Forroughlythe
past 20 years, baseballwas the pigpen
of sports.

Ah, but of course this isn’t only

A about one little failed steroid test. No,

Ortiz has continued to fall almost as
quickly as his slugging percentage. -

After the ﬁrst two games ofthis
season, Ortizwas 0-7. Reporters ques-
tioned him about his slow start, and
Ortiz wasn’t too happy about it.

Q got to go ahead and hit for me,” Ortiz

said. _

Thatthird expletive has me really
intrigued. Of course, the ﬁrst and sec-
ondonesaneﬁintothinkaboutbecause
they’rebacktoback, butthatthird one
istheshiningstarinthehissyﬁt.

Well, notimetodwellontl1at,solet’s
keep moving. Lastweek, Reut;ers.com
reported thatjay-Z andjuan Perez, his
business partner, sued Ortiz. 1

Ortiz openedabarinhis native Do-

AlexRodriguez (1998) and Alfonso So-
riano (2006) have joined the invented
club.

Just for ﬁm, if you combine Ortiz’s
career steals with Jay—Z’s, you have
10 stolen bases. Of course, Ortiz has

played 1,460 more professional base-

ball games thanjay-Z.

That brings us to today, arguably
Ortiz’s lowest point: a known steroid
user with a foul mouth who got on
Jay—Z’s bad side. Also, Ortiz is hitiing

If you combine e0rrtiz’s career steels with Jay-—Z’s you 4

’ have  st0ten.bases..  Of course, Ortiz has played

1,460  parofessionarl basebati pgamies than Jpay—Z.

“You guys wait till [expletive] hap-

pens, thenyou cantalk [eiq)letive],”Or—
tizsaid to ESPN .com. “Two [expletive]
games, and already you [expletives] are
goingcl‘-313'-” .

Despite afondness for madl1'bs, it’s

 Republic and named it Forty/

.171 this season with no homeruns,
three walks, 15 strikeouts and a .237
on-base percentage. He also has zero
stolen bases.

But Ortiz shouldn’t feel too bad
about thejay-Z situation. He’s not the
ﬁrstathletet0getint0atiﬂ'wit.’narap—
per.

Back in 2000, Boston Celtic Paul
Piercewas stabbed11 times atanight-
club, andthethree menarrestedforthe

stabbing all had ties to the rap group
Made Men, accordingto theAss0ciated
Press. MadeMenwas agroupthatﬁrst
appeared in the late ’ 90s and released
just one album. ,

A year later, a less violent incident
occurred when bad boy rapper Aaron
Carterclaimed hebeatthen-Lakers star
Shaquille O’Neal in a one-on-one bas-
ketball game in his song ‘That’s Howl
Beatshaq.” There are afewthingsthat
have been disputed for years. First,
who plays one-on—0ne games with a
timer? Next, whywas Shaq patrolling
parks looking for a 13-year-old to play
basketball against? Is the hoop Carter

' balances on in the video 10-feet high,

orcanheﬂy?Als0,wouldn’t Shaq have
been more amusing in the videoaior
‘iAaron’s Party (Come Get It)?”

You can also make a pretxy strong
casethat Kobe Bryant’s “K.O.B.E.” and
Roy_]ones]r.’s “Ya’ll Must’ve Forgot’ ’are
the audio equivalent of being stabbed
11 times.

For Ortiz, one of the more jovial
athletes in recent memory, it’s been
sad, slow decline. ‘ ‘

Almost as slow as Ortiz trying to
steal a base. Or his present—day bat
speed; ‘
