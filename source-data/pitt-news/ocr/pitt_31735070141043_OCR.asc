ofessor hit by bus to leave hospital

by Drew Singer
and Liz Navratil’
Netm Edito/‘.1

A Pitt professor who was hit by
a bus Friday is scheduled to leave the
hospital no later than Monday, said a
Port Authority spokesman.

Emergency workers transported
Sabina Deitiick, an associate profes-
sor at the Pitt Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs, to
UPMC Presbyterian hospital after
she was struck by Port Authority bus
No. 2327 on Fifth Avenue directly
outside of the \X/illiam Pitt Union
bus circle just before noon.

UPMC is yet to confirm Dei-
trick’s status. .

Deittick stepped out in front of
the 54C traveling in the bus lane,

and the bus driver, Daryl Glaze, at-
tempted to swerve, but still hit her,
said Port Authority spokesman Dave
Whipkey

More than 10 emergency vehicles,
mostly police cruisers, responded to
the scene.

Other ofﬁcers taped the area
around the Union’s bus circle to
keep observers away from a pool of

blood.

Police investigated the exterior of
Port Authority bus No. 2327. They
took pictures of the scene and circled
the pool of blood with yellow spray
paint Police then hammered the tape
into the pavement and began 
measurements. Around 12:45 p.m.,
they extended the police line to block
off about a third of the bus circle

The incident comes eight days
after a police enforcement campaign
in Oakland in which 12 pedestrians
were cited for failing to cross prop-
erly and two days after a Carlow
student was hit by a car on Bigelow
Boulevard.

Glaze has been working for the
Port Authority since September

Panhandlers persistent

even Without milk crates

When it comes to sparing
some change, maybe college
students are just more generous.
But it’s no secret that Oakland
has a signiﬁcant panhandling
population. '

The Pitt policepwill look to
the law for a new way to restrict
panhandling in Oakland’s streets.
State law makes it illegal to use
any crates, cases, trays, baskets or
boxes used by dairy companies
to transport milk without the
owner’s permission. After com-
panies that use crates to trans-
port dairy and other goods lost
so many of these items, Penn-
sylvania passed a law to enforce
their uncontrolled dispersion
around two decades ago.

The Pitt police recently ap-
plied this law to panhandlers and
have already cited individuals.
But as an effort to combat pan-
handling, the enforcement of
this law misses the scope of the
overall matter.

Even without a crate to sit
on, panhandlers won’t likely just
get up ‘and abandon the Oakland
neighborhood. Sure, a milk crate
serves as the perfect seat. It’s
small, light, sturdy and portable.
Without, the milk crate, though,
the panhandler is not necessarily
left helpless. ~

It’s still legal to search through
and claim items found in the
trash, which is what panhandlers

' would likely resort to if the police 
strictly enforce thewlaw. Whether]
it’s a box, an old tire or a piece of  t _

wood, the ubiquitous milk crate
has countless substitutes. Whe

it comes down to] it, enforcirigf

‘what panhandlers caniand can

_ however, panhandlers

  
   
   
  
  

across a milk crate or similar ob— T
ject on Oakland’s streets. Panhan— :

dlersi probably ‘ﬁnd their provin-
cial chairs outside of storefronts
or tossed in an alley. If owners
don’t want them stolen, perhaps
they should not leave them lying
around or unsupervised.

The Pitt police argue that a V

panhandling individual stationed

on a milk crate on the sidewalk .

restricts the path of pedestrians.
According to the law, a legitimate
obstruction “renders impassable
without unreasonable incon-
venience or hazar .” Typically,
reside
with their backs to the building

in front of which they station i
themselves. For the pedestrian t

passing by, the» only real obstruc-

tion might be an outstretched .

hand hoping for a few coins to

clench. And without a physical ‘
object such as a milk crate" to sit 
on, the panhandler is ‘perhaps '
more inclined to sprawl out on ‘

the sidewalk and thus take up 

IIIOIC space;

It’s clear that panhandlers 1
tend to reside on streets with L
heavier pedestrian -traffic like 3
Forbes Avenue. The logic behind :
this is obvious: The more people ;
passing by, the more likely the :
chance that someone will spare 5
some money. Milk crates or not, 
panhandlers won’t suddenly re— 9
treat to desolate surroundings if 3
gpanhandling is their main way of 
is making money. 0

it be neat to walk into a bookstore

before your birthday that everyone
decided not to plan a surprise party.
Yet, there is some hope. Face-
book’s terms do state, “We reserve

When I think back to dark times
in the world’s history —— Nazi Ger-

help but feel happy and safe. I am
so thankful for our glorious free-

America, there is simply no room for

maybe even publish/sell/dist1ibute/

But, people are forgetting Facebook

Kings are only out for them-

I’m writing in response to Giles Howard’s column “Obama’s policies strip liberties.”

I’m amazed that anyone can sit through the worst crisis of capitalism since 1929 and claim the superiority
of the free market with a straight face.

Instead of telling the truth about the root causes of the ﬁnancial crisis, Howard shills for ﬁnance capital and
the casino capitalists on Wall Street by laying most of the blame on the “stupid” and the “worst” of society —
namely the poor and minorities — who have been told for years that the ultimate prize in the American Dream

Howard then proceeds to blather on aboutour nation’s alleged history of free market success and entrepre-
neurship, with success and prosperity unimpeded by intrusive and hostile government intervention. This narra-
tive is nothing more than sheer historical fantasy mixed with market mythology. The actions of governments in
capitalist societies are never hostile to capital, but are in fact quite the opposite. They’re invariably dictated by the
interests of capital. Both in the present day and throughout history this collusion between capital and the state
is clearly made manifest, whether as the looting of billions of taxpayers’ dollars by Wall Street with the govern-
ments approval or as the use of government troops by that “great entrepreneur” Andrew Carnegie to suppress

A taste of Italy in the middle Oakland

Groceria Merante a local staple

by Marc Schutzbank
Staﬂ Writer

Underneath an awning of
green, white and red rests oneof
Oakland’s greatest treasures, the
Groceria Merante. Situated at
the corner of Bates and McKee
streets, Groceria Merante takes
students through time, when
Oakland was not-a student haven,
but a tightly knit immigrant com-
munity.

Founded underneath the
Schenley Bridge by Pasquale
Merante two generations ago,
Pasquale’s original groceria has
moved and been passed down to
his son, Italo, to his two daugh-
ters. Julie Durantte, 41, co—owns
the business

percorns and other spices. ’

Merante’s does not just have a
local following. Mike Wiencek, a
construction worker, drives in at
least twice a month from Wash-
ington, Pa. for the grocery’s big-
gest seller: homemade sausage.
Crafted with love by the sisters’
uncle, Salvatore Merante, the hot
sausage is purported to taste bet-
ter than anything available at Gi-
ant Eagle.

“When Sal makes his hot sau-
sage, he coarse grinds it. With this
you can taste the actual pork. It’s
just not done like that commer-
cially,” said Wiencek. "

Now a long way from an

full of homemade wedding soup
and neon signs that hang on the
deli case. Customers will ﬁnd
sandwich Swiss and the more ex-
otic tipo gennoveta or imported
parma Italian prosciutto, which
are Italian meats ﬂaked with pep-

always ensuring
that his meat is
all meat, not like packaged sau-
sage, which Durantte claims is
“ﬁlled with pig’s eyes.” '

Employees move swiftly to‘

prepare for the morning rush,
cutting cheese for their signature,
loaf-of—bread length hoagies.

“It’s the very ‘opposite of
corporate —— we have a lot of
people who just hang out,” said
Durantte. ,

As the last slice of Swiss fell
off the machine, retired Pitt Pro-

fessor jim DeAngelis walked in
from a recent trip to France, chat-
ting amicably with the ladies.

“I’ve been eating all this Euro
stuff. I coulduse a fix of roast
beef. You know that American
thing,” he said.

From Italian sausage to tur-
key and roast beef, the deli case
is often a place where customers
indulge in more’ than just meats
and cheeses.

For nearly 20 minutes, the

whole store was crowded with '

voices, and conversation became
storytelling. Patrons and employ-
ees alike were caught up in the
most important function of a
neighborhood market: commu-
nication.

This is a place to catch up with
family and friends, where talk
blends in with the smell of fresh
bread and spicy sautéed pepper
wafting from the back. _ '

Italian families _ ' forsake their
warm cozy homes, taking a cold,
blistery walk to Merante’s.

“[There’s] an old man who
somehow places his bags upon

his shoulder, takes his cane and,

slowly makes his way to and from
our store,” said Durantte.

Italian women, who frequent
on ' the weekends, banter with
younger student shoppers. The
teasing is important, as it helps
students realize that they are not
the sole inhabitants of Oakland.
They should recognize its cultural
past. At about 9:45 a.m., Pasquale
“Pat” Pizzonia throws the door
open with gusto. Dressed warm-
ly in Steelers gear, he hoists his
freshly baked bread from Rimini’s
through the door. It’s a business

Neal's outlaw country a golden highway

by Tony J ovenitti -
-Staﬁ’ Writer

Out of Highway

Willie Heath Neal

Chicken Ranch Records
Rocks Like: Chris LeDoux, ,
Willie Nelson ’

 

Country music ain’t what it
used to -be, and Willie Heath Neal
knows this all too well. _

If his music were released 
the 1950s or 1960s, he would
have been wildly" popular. Music
Row in Nashville might not have
accepted him — as they rejected
other outlaws like Willie Nelson
and Waylon Jennings, but the
honky-tonk bars down the street
would have welcomed him with
open taps.

However, contemporary coun-
try music has become extremely
showy and almost pop-like.

Neal criticizes this in his up-
coming album Ouz‘ 0/’ Hzgbzz/:91."

His unique brand of music fea— .i

tures his outlaw cowboy voice,
which sounds like a cross between
Chris LeDoux and Willie Nelson,
blended with bluegrass bands and

other country-themed instrumen-
tals.

The album kicks off with
three songs about lost love, but
only one of those songs is slow.
The other two, "‘Cryin’ All The
Time” and .“Can’t Get You Off
My Mind,” are surprisingly up-
beat — especially considering the
titles. H .

They can only be categorized
as delightfully depressing. It seems
a mystery as to why Neal chose
to put these almost oxymoronic
songs at the beginning
of his album. The mys-
tery is solved  the next
few songs, though.

.“Porter’s Blues” is
his most blatant criti-
cism of contemporary.
country music. i

“There ain’t a star in the sky
of Nashville,” croons Neal in the
song’s opening song. “His turn to

shine is overdue / And the honky _

tonks downtown don’t shine like
they used to do.”

The simple acoustic and steel
guitars with a basic drum part add
to the songs message. Neal sings
with a reference to Johnny Cash,

“And he don’t mean no harm. / W

 

He’s just trying to walk the line 
You got to get stoned just to get
through. / Maybe that’s,the rea-
son / Porter’s got the blues.”

If “Porter’s Blues” is the most
blatant —— and probably autobio-
graphical — criticism of Nash-

ville, then the next song is the _

most creative.

.“Something’s Wrong with the
Radio” is a musically risky, but
also genius song about a broken
heart. It starts out with an up-
beat, ragtime piano“melody as he

sings “I wrote this song
_ about how bad that you
done me. / Itfs real sad,

I and it’s real slow.”
Then the rag-
time music
stops and switches to
a rock melody with
electric guitar as Neal sings “And
everybody tells me it’s a hit song.
/ There’s just something wrong
with the radio.” As he repeats the
word “radio” the music switches

, back to the ragtime.
The woman who broke his ..

heart could symbolize ‘ coun-
try music, because he sings, “I
thought you were true when I
ﬁrst met you.’/ I was too young to

abruptly -

know,” before the music switches
back to rock again.

This could explain the first few
songs on the album about heart-
break. If his lost love isvcountry
music, then these songs could be
satirizing contemporary , country

because the topics really don’t‘

fit the music — which seems to
be one of his biggest beefs with
Nashville. New country .musi-
cians still sing about many of the
same things that classic country
did, but the music is drastically
different.

A few tracks later on the al-
bum, “Outlaw Song” depicts
how much has really changed in
the world of country music. It’s a
fast—paced steel and electric guitar
melody with a simple drum beat
as he sings about his love interest
leaving him.

“You need a suit and a tie,

' briefcase guy. / A man with mon-

ey in the bank,” sings Neal. “Well
I just.wouldn’t listen when you
told me before, / ‘Ladies don’t
love outlaws no more.”’ A

He brings up a very interesting‘

point h'ere.v~In the ’50s and ’60s,
the ladies swooned for outlaws.
To give some perspective on how

much outlaws were welcomed
by the young generation of the
time, Willie Nelson and Waylon
Jennings went on tour with Bob
Dylan and Elvis.

After he spends most of the
album ridiculing Nashville, he
returns to his outlaw roots with
“Attitude” and the title track.

“Attitude” is clearly not fit for
radio. Not only is it only two min-
utes and 13 seconds long, it also
relies heavily on expletives as he
warns his woman to drop the at-
titude.

“Inside you’re beat up ring,

there’s probably a whore. / If
you don’t shut your mouth, you’re’

gonna feel the ﬂoor,” he sings to
the fast—paced melody of instru-
mentals.

Then he shouts “Attitude, / what
you got’s a f**king attitude.”

It’s refreshing to seesomeone
trying to bring country back to
its outlaw roots without boring
listeners about how new country
has lost its touch. Neal ﬁnds sev-
eral extremely creative ways to do
this, and Om‘ of Hzgbu/qy has this

No band”-name jokes

by Marc Schutzbank
Staff’ Writer

For(n)ever

‘ Hoobastank
Island Records
Rocks like: a whinier
Linkin Park

 

The name says it all:
Hoobastank. It’s the word formed
when you ask, “Who’d want to
buy such a piece of stank?” after
you’ve listened to enough quality

. music to finally purge the band’s

new album, For{n)ever, from your
memory forever.

Before the disc even hits

your. player, there are problems.-

Let’s talk about the album art.
Hoobastank consists of three
men, Doug Robb, Dan Estrin and
Chris Hesse, all with some" sort
of facial hair that says, “I tried

to grow a beard, but _it’s just not
happening.” On the cover, each
has his chin up, staring out with

squinty eyes. The stares bore into »

listeners’ heads, daring them to
press play. It’s all very annoying
anditoo much for me. '

The grunge album starts with
“My Turn,” which is a big whine.
It is all just a farce. It’d be differ-

-entif they were sitting around on

the corner of Forbes and Bigelow
singing this song. But they’re not;
they’re in an extremely nice stu-
dio. Sing about things you actu-
ally know about, stankers.

The beats for some songs are
not all that bad, but only if you
like synthetics and background
guitar. Hoobastank - has some
similarities to  Park, except
for surprisingly great voices. The
guitar and drums are background
noises, not an integral part of the

‘movie. Overachieving

necessary. Hoobastankbombs

music. This is to be expected as
more pop focuses less on music,
instead favoring the actual per-
former. Hoobastank follows in
that tradition, as the band puts
out sub—par albums while throw-
ing fun concerts.

In “All About You,” a bass
line with a quick beat meets. a
high—toned guitar. The song
holds promise until '
the vocals come in.
The whole song is
like something right i
out of a dumb dating

girlfriend" puts seem-
ingly slacker boyfriend
down. She always talks _
about herself, and he just wants to
point out that it’s “not all about
you.” Some “scream-singing”
helps get his point across. Just
hit skip.

 

When I first read the title,
“Tears of Yesterday,” I just
thought, “Damn it.” But when
I heard a piano introduction
with what seems to be a synthe-
sized violin plucking in the back-
ground, I gave it a chance. The
lyrics are nothing to get excited
about, but Hoobastank found out
that it could make music. The
piano background
helps root the vocals
in something other
than aimless guitar.

This '
high point, though,
that I knew would
not last. When “Who
the Hell Am I?” came
on, it was over. Let me give you
a little taste, just so you can com-
miserate:. “And. it feels like I am
naked, / Stripped for you to see.

/ My scars and imperfections, / 7

W35 2.

But you don’t seem to notice.”
Dude, we’ve got our problems,
too, we don’t really want to hear
about yours. *
_ Hoobastank is a synth-band.
These instrumentals sound‘ en-
hanced by computers, along with
the vocals. The band isn’t made
of poets — these lyrics are bad at
best. It’s a shame that music has
veered so far away fromijames
Taylor, Tom Petty, the Boss or
even Journey. This musical gen-
eration doesn’t compare to the
great artists of yesteryear.

Who will take up the mantle

' when those artists are gone? Cer-

tainly not Hoobastank.

While For'(n)euer has brief, shin-
ing moments of — mediocrity, the
overwhelming majority of the al-
bum is just bland, tired, overdone
alt—rock. And it couldn’t be over
soon enough. _ ‘ C

Pizzonia was driving through Oakland on
his delivery route when the brightly col-
ored Italian ﬂag caught his eye. The busi-
ness partnership began immediately,

“The first loaf was free,” said Pizzonia
said. “You know, we Italians got to stick
together.” ‘ . .

Julie headed to the back counter as she
readied herself for the huge lunch rush.
She reached for a cornucopia of savory
meats, salty cheeses and hot peppers to put

on her Italian hoagies. She explained just

how popular these sandwiches are.

“We start off with about 100 loaves a
day. -By lunchtime, we’re almost all gone. If
you Want one, call ahead,” she said.

Oakland, like other parts of Pittsburgh,
is slowly becoming more corporate, often
losing the touches of community and fam-
ily that make areas like Pitt so interesting.

Pressure helps Cardinals drop Pitt women

Staﬁ’ Wrder

. The Pitt men’s basketball team
made the trip to Providence on
Tuesday, and the Panthers were
knocked off on an emotional se-
nior night The Pitt women’s team
experienced something similar on
Saturday night.

Louisville seniors Candyce
Bingham and Angel McCought:ry
excelled on senior day, helping the
No. 8 Cardinals trample Pitt’s hopes
of becoming the second seed in the

. Big East with a 75-51 win.

Pitt never obtained a lead, but
held tight through much of the first
half and trailed by six at intermis-
sion. But Louisville’s late—garne in-
tensity was uncontainable.

Following the leadership of Mc-
Coughtry and Bingham, the Car-

dinals controlled the game with a
dominant second half.

Bingham outscored everyone
with a career high of 26 points,
while McCought1'y contributed 22
points and seven rebounds for the
Cardinals.

Averaging 23.4 points per game,
McCoughtry is currently the sixth-
leading scorer in the country fol-
lowed by Pitt’s Shavonte Zellous,
who averages 23 points.

Zellous ended with 15 points
for the night Sophronia Sallard fol-
lowed with 13.

The loss snapped the_ Panthers’
three-game  streak, mov-
ing Pitt to 21-6 overall and 11-4 in
league play.

Pitt cannot move up or down in
the conference now.

“We wanted the win, but no

matter what happens against St
John’s we will ﬁnish third in the Big
East, and I think that is an amazing
accomplishment,” said Pitt coach
Agnus Berenato.

1 ’ Louisville used its half—court
press to pressure Pitt, and it took
the Panthers nearly 10 minutes to
reach double digits. The pressure
from the Cardinals resulted in 15
Pitt turnovers in the first half. Pitt
averaged 14 turnovers  game
throughout this season. __

With a perfect 5—of—5»;sli1ooting
at the half, Sallard was one of the
only factors that kept Pitt in the
game during the first hair;

“We were very lucky. to be so
close at the half, with the number
of turnovers we had,” said Ber-
enato. “I told the girls, ifgwe cut the
turnovers in half, that’s seven more

possessions and 14 points for us. We
had 25 turnovers for the game.”

Four minutes into the second
half, Zellous acquired a quiet 14
points andXenia Stewart stepped
up offensively to bring the Panthers
within three, 43-40.

There was a brief ‘exchange of
baskets in transition before Louis-
ville’s crowd became too much for
Pitt The 11,000 enthusiastic sup-
porters became the sixth man for
theiCardinals.  

Down by seven with 12:51 on
the clock, Berenato called a timeout
in attempt to break the increasing
Cardinal momentum, but it was too

late.

The Panthers went scoreless for
eight minutes, while Louisville took
center stage making the score 62-
45 before the Panthers found the

Blair expected to play, J A

with hyperextended knee

by Mike Gladysz

Pitt sophomore center Dejuan
Blair is currently nursing aihyper—
extended left knee after colliding
with Seton Hall’s Jeremy Hazell
on Saturday, but he is still expect-
ed to play when the Panthers take
the floor on Wednesday night.

Blair, who averages 15.6 points
and 12.7 rebounds per game this
season for Pitt, hit the ground af-
ter defending a pick—and—roll just
2:39 into Saturday night's game.
He remained on the ground for
about a minute before making his
way to the locker room for treat-
ment.

He re—entered the game with
13:23 remaining and went back to
the locker room once more, but
still ﬁnished with nine points and
10 rebounds in 26 minutes.

Meanwhile," Pitt guard/for-
ward Gilbert Brown, who slightly
turned his ankle on Thursday
during practice, continues to feel
a bit of soreness. Guard Levance
Fields is also nursing a sore knee,
but neither injury is expected to
be serious.

Pitt sophomore Elizabeth Adams, shown here in a match against West
Virginia earlier this year, lost her first contest of the year on Saturday.

by Robbie Kleinmuntz
Staﬂ W/Vritcr

It was going to happen even-
tually to the Pitt tennis team.

The Panthers suffered a 5-2
loss to Buffalo at home on Satur-
day, their first loss of the season.

Heading into the match, Pitt
coach George Dieffenbach knew
it was going to be a battle.

“Buffalo is an outstanding

team with a lot of depth,” said

Dieffenbach. “We knew we were
facing a very strong team.”

It was a trend that was obvi-
ous throughout the day. A

At No. 1 singles, previously
unbeaten sophomore Elizabeth
Adams lost her first match of the
year 6-2, 6-3 to Denise Harjanto.

Meanwhile Pitt’s No. 2 singles
player, Sabrina Visram, sat out
because of an ACL injury.

Dieffenbach said that if Vis-
ram was in the lineup, some of
the singles matches could have
gone the other way, and the out-
come of the overall match could
have been different.

“Having [Visram] would ha’v,e"

changed the complexion of the

match,” said Dieffenbach. _
Dieffenbach said that -no

decision has been made about

flo has Pit tennis year's first loss

whether or not Visram will have
surgery.

\While the overall match was a
disappointment for Pitt (7-1, 4-0
Big East), the high point on Sat-
urday was sweeping-the doubles
competitions.

Adams and Kristy Borza
upped their record to 8-0 in No. 1
doubles this season, beating Har-
janto and Diana Popescu, 8-6. It
was the first loss this season for
Harjanto and Popescu. A

“Sweeping the doubles against
a team like this is a tremendous
accomplishment for Pitt tennis,”
said Dieffenbach. “It shows that
we are as competitive as a team
like Buffalo.”

Buffalo, now 3-3 on the year,
won the MAC last year.

—Adela Aprodu was the only
Panther to win at singles, as she
beat Aleksandra Petrova 6-1, 7-5
at No. 5 singles.

“[Aprodu] has had a really
good season and has stepped up
for the plate for us so far,” said
Dieffenbach. “She plays with a
lot _of intensity and offense.”

Pitt  have a shot at’b6unc-
ing back when it faces St. Thomas
(Fla.) and Nova Southeastern on
the road next week during spring
break. '

“We will get back in the gym, and
get ready for our senior day against_
St. ]ohn’s. Stewart and Zellous have; 1
worked so hard to lead our team all
year, and we all deserve to get rid of
this feeling we have as the result of
this game.”

Pitt seniors leave Fitzger

Pitt gymnastics coach Debbie
Yohrnan has a sign in her ofﬁce that
reads, “lt’s not the win, it’s the score”
For gymnastic  this is of-
ten the case because the system isn’t
based on wins or losses

Still,  down a ranked op-
ponent always feels good. It felt
even better on senior night, as Pitt
defeated No. 26 Denver Saturday at
the Fitzgerald Field House, 194.725-
193.700. .

Marquette and Connecticut aren’t really
known for pressuring their opponents, but they

could learn a lesson from how Providence and

Seton Hall attacked the Panthers this past week
Pitt’s younger players, particularly Wanamaker,
sophomore Gilbert Brown and freshman Ash-
ton Gibbs, have wilted under the full—court
press and skin-tight defense the Fiiars and Pi-
rates applied ,

At this point in the Big East season, all bets
are off. Georgetown, left for dead just days
ago, came up with a monumental victory over
Villanova on Saturday. A similarly desperate
Notre Dame fell short in an upset bid at No. 2
Connecticut. And Marquette could freefall fol-
lowing the loss of senior point guard Dominic
Jarnesand its subsequent losses at Connecticut
and Lohisvi'l1e ’ThepGolden Eagles will give Pitt
everything they have on Wednesday

_,.Pit;t_'.'c,oacl'l Jamie Dixon should prepare his-

team for defensive pressure this week, because
 against Marquette and Connecticut at the
Petersen Events Center would guarantee a No.
1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, regardless
of the team’s Big East tournament outcome
Although a top seed isn’t necessary come
March Madnessiime, it would certainly help
in perhaps the most wi_cle—open dance ﬂoor in
years. Every major contender has a weakness,

and Pitt’s was finally" exposed in its last road tlip_

of the season .

The Panthers need _to adjust against the
press and keep improving They can’t come out
ﬂat this week or they’ll stumble once
