Decisi o
Pitt

Legislation passed by the
state House Wednesday con-
cerning the status of Pennsylva-
nia’s 13 colleges and Indiana
University will have no effect
on Pitt, according to Walter
Koch, a legislative liaison in the
department of education.

The bill, if signed into law by
Governor Richard Thorn-
burgh, would consolidate the
colleges into a state system of
higher education that would be
ruled by a 16-member board of
governors. Koch said. I

The board will consist of the
governor, the secretary of edu-
cation and 14 gubernatorial
appointees, who must gain
approval by the state Senate.
There will alsobe a chancellor
employed by the board to do
administrative duties.

The names of the l3 colleges

will be changed with “of Penn-
sylvania” added. Indiana Uni-
versity will keep its name. The
colleges involved are: Blooms-
berg, California, Cheyney,.
Clarion, East Stroudsburgh,
Edinboro, Kutztown, Lock
Haven, Mansfield, Millersville,
Shippensburg, Slippery Rock
and West Cliester. The name
change will make Edinboro, for
example, Edinboro University
of Pennsylvania.

  Equal Rights Not Dead

By LAURIE MacLEOD

The Equal Rights Amendment
is not dead, according to political
science associate professor Susan
Hansen, but has a broad reservoir
of support. ~

Hansen spoke on “ERA: A Post
Mortem," in the first in a series of
noontime lectures sponsored by the
Honors Program Student Cabinet.

The issue of the ERA has shifted
from abstractions to economic
rights, winning it the support of
labor groups and blacks, she said,
adding that the ERA would proba-
bly end up as a state issue change in
the books.

“Now a bottom-up strategy is
dominant,” she said. “The trend is
to keep the issue alive."

The ERA is, according to
Hansen. a limited attempt to
change the way t.hejudi('ial process
has operated. ~

The amendment was first intro-
duced to Congress in 1923, but was
never a grass roots movement until
the 19705, she said. The support for
ERA has remained at about 58 per-
cent through the years, but the
opposition has increased.

She said that public opinion is a
major reason that the ERA is
dying, even though it has strong
support.

“In a study done at the Univer-
sity of Illinois, women who
opposed ERA were older, less edu-
cated, religious and very concerned
about how ERA would affect
divorce, child support and aliin-
ony," she said. “Also,'6l percent of

people polled didn't know if their

state considered ERA."

Hansen said that it is hard to get
a controversial issue passed." In
short, the system is statketl against
anything controversial.”

 

Issues

Accepting Responsibility

_Knowledge is a good thing, but
difficulties can stem from the
unpredictability of new knowl-
edge, according to Herbert Simon,
the 1978 Nobel Prize winner for
Economics and Psychology and
computer science professor at
Carnegie-Mellon University.

Simon spoke on “Things We
Should Not Know," our responsi-
bility to obtain knowledge, at a lec-
ture sponsored by the Forum of
Social Responsibility and Values.

He focused his talk on the
responsibility of scientists, and
people in general, to accept and
generate knowledge.

Simon said most people have a
healthy and public participation

on important ISSUE--._I)lll for those
who don't. “there is Fro reason to

feel helpless because you are notan
expert in the field. There are only a
few experts who have the time to
know everything there is to know,
and sometimes that is not enough.
Participation does matter.”

He said it’s important for people
to develop an understanding of
both sides of an issue and learn to
cross-examine. '

“All of us talk about being
responsible people, but the first
step in being responsible is to
accept responsibility for under-
standing and gaining knowledge,"
he said. We must learn to expose

ourselves to both sides of an issue, .

Simon said.

“The danger is that we may see
good in every argument and never
be able to take a position, but look-

Up For

The Black Action Society
(BAS) got the term off to a rous-
ing start last weekend by hold-
ing its annual “Get Acquainted
Weekend" for freshmen and
new students.

 The purpose of the weekend

was to acquaint black freshmen
and other students to faculty
members, BAS officers, and
other student organization
leaders at Pitt. .

The weekend started Friday
night with an “Indaba” (infor-
mal rap session). The guest
speaker was former BAS chair-
person Romana Riscoe. Riscoe
spoke to the freshmen about the
problems that face black stu-
dents at Pitt. A‘ .

The Black Engineers Coun-
cil, the Campus Christian Out-
reach Ministry, the Pre-Medical
Organization for Minority Stu-

b dents, and Progressive Student

Network and Some of God’s
Children were the groups
represented at the “Indaba.”

‘‘It was the first time I have
ever seen so many organizations
assembled at the same time,”
Riscoe said.

On Saturday, a picnic was
held on the Cathedral of Learn-
ing lawn. Over‘/300 students and
faculty members attended the
picnic. Bruce Rogers, current

Black Action
Society Gears

Year

Chairman of BAS said the week-
end was a “positive and unify-
/ing experience.”'

The BAS plans to have .
former Georgia state ‘Senator
Julian Bond as the featured
speaker of this year’s Black
Week. Black Week is an annual
event which reacquaints stu-
dents with their black heritage.
Last year, national syndicated
journalist Carl T. Rowan was
the featured speaker. A concert’
featuring Roy Ayers and Jean
Carn, a play and a soul food
night were held. ‘

Ti 3 BAS has one of the high-
est znemberships of all student
organizations on campus. Once
a black student is admitted to
Pitt, he or she automatically
becomes a member of BAS.

In addition to Black Week
and other events, BAS also pub-
ljﬁhes a journal six times a year,
according to Savona Bailey,
fhairperson of the publication. '

The journal focuses on carn-
pus news, national and interna- -
tional news. It also has an
editorial * page. ' Another
column, entitled “FYI," pub-
lishes class papers by students
about different Afro-American
histories and accomplishments.

The journal, which has a cir-
culation of 500, is open to any
student who wishes to write.

year’s Black Week.

Board Rules On Black Week

By GRACE NORDINI

The Black Action Society will
have $500 less than originally allo-
cated for its Black Week, the Stu-
dent Government Board decided
yesterday. '

BAS had originally asked for
$3,000 for Julian Bond to speak,
but the actual amount for Bond
was reduced to $2,500. BAS had
planned to use the additional $500
to have the Kunta Repertory Thea-
tre perform. , A

The board, however, decided
that the pre-planned events were

adequate and rejected the Kunta
Repertory Theatre spending 7-2.
“It’s not our purpose to fund the
things the Pitt Program Council
could do,” said board member
Linda O'Connor.
Other funding decisions made
by the board include:
‘O Tabling a Studio Theater
emergency request for $200 to

J replace locks damaged by vandal-

ism this summer. The board
pecided to study whether the studio
theater is under the jurisdiction of
the board or the theater arts
department.

0 Rejecting a $475 request for a
sound proof booth.

0 Rejecting a request by the Jazz
Ensemble for reimbursement of
purchases made last year. The
board’s policy is not to fund deficit
spending. _

0 Tabling a Phi Eta Sigma
request for funding of a telephone.
Phi Eta Sigma is a tutoring service.
The board decided to wait until the
actual amount of the request was
decided before making a decision.
0 Rejecting a Hand-in-Hand
group request for a typewriter.

FORUM

Controversial Speakers

G. Gordon Liddy, Timothy
Leary, Jeanne Kirkpatrick Those '
names, no doubt, still provoke
angry feelings among some stu-
dents and faculty members.
Their appearances here were crit-
icized by some as inappropriate.

[ The choice of Kirkpatrick as
1981 commencement speaker,
in particular, led to some harsh
words, not only about the policies
she represents, but also about the
reasons why and the procedure
for how she was chosen.

This week's Forum interviewed
several people involved in or criti-
cal of how the university and stu-
dent groups choose speakers
and their beliefs about dealing
with controversial ones.

Gina Miller
F Pitt Program

Council

, Gina Miller, assistant director
of student activities who works
with the ‘Pitt Program Council,

.«

said the PPC sponsored two
appearances by G. Gordon Liddy
since 1980 because of his role in
recent history.

She said the group anticipated
criticism of the recent debate
between Watergate conspirator
Liddy and drug advocate
Timothy Leary. However, the PPC
had its reasons for planning the
debate.

"Each of them played signifi-
cant roles in contemporary his-
-tory," Miller said. “They
drastically altered the course of
events and had a great effect on
what happened."

The debate, Miller believes,
was also an educational exper-
ience.

“By bringing them in, we pro-
vided an atmosphere where stu-
dents could make critical
decisions about their beliefs and
sharpen their own values," Miller
said.

Last winter, the Pitt Program
Council sponsored a debate
betweeen Cal Thomas, a spokes-
man for the Moral Majority, and
Birch Bayh, a former U.S. Sena-

J; 4. e ‘-«

s. ‘e "4' ” ‘t ‘’-z«

st”

tor whose reelection campaign
was” opposed "by the Moral
Majority.

Miller said there was some
opposition to that debate from
proponents of the separate sides
involved in it. She said, however,
that the debates the group spon-
sors have been well attended.

Miller added that the PPC does
not necessarily endorse the views
of the speakers it sponsors.

Peggy Ferri

Honors Program

Pitt junior Peggy Ferri is coordi-
nator of the Honors Student
Cabinet Lunchtime Lecture Ser-
ies. She is responsible for arrang-
ing and organizing speeches by
faculty members and others on
political or topical issues.

Although F erri has not run into
any controversy about speakers
for her programs yet, she thinks
that that may change in the near
future. Next week's speaker,

Robert Hazo, is a director of the
ArabAmerican Foundation and
will speak on foundations for
peace in the Middle East.

Ferri said she is “very much in
favor" of allowing controversial
topics to be discussed in her
programs. .

“That's what a university is
about," F erri said. ‘‘I’m very much

‘ in favor of freedom of speech and
the marketplace of ideas.”

John Beverly J
Pitt Professor

When U.l‘l.‘ Ambassadors

Jeanne Kirkpatrick was
announced by the university as its
choice for the 1981 commence-
ment ceremony, Pitt Spanish pro-

« fessor John Beverly wasn’t alone
in voicing his criticism.

Beverly’s name was-one of 100 '

signed to a letter protesting the
decision that appeared in the Uni-
versity Times.

Although the Kirkpatrick deci-

on Campus

sion was denounced by religious
leaders and others, Beverly was
also upset about the procedure
for selecting her. He believes that
faculty and student should have
had more of a say in the com-
mencement speaker selection
Chancellor Wesley Posvar said
at the time that the Kirkpatrick
decision was reviewed by both
the University Senate Committee
chairman and by members of

Kirkpatrick's discipline, political‘

science.

However, Beverly said the con-
sulting that was actually done was
selective and did not accurately
represent the feelings of that
department.

“My feeling is that honorary
speakers should be selected by a
faculty and student committee,"
Beverly said, explaining he thinks
that is a more democratic
process.

Beverly added that currently
there is no formal appeals pro-
cess for faculty of students who
oppose a choice. He said, how-
ever, that the University Senate
could declare its ooposition as a

whole to a particular speaker.

Referring to scientific knowl-

Simon quoted Pope John Paul

the world from the “criminal use of
their discoveries.”

He said the most that we can
hope for is that when applying
scientific knowledge, scientists
will amplify good consequences
relative to bad consequences.

“I don’t hope for a Utopia by all
this,” he said. “I don’t have faith in
Utopias because of the ability of
our species to keep wanting more.”

He said a more reasonable goal

Searching For

  A Solution

The Pitt Program Council has had to deal with
what it has perceived for a long time as the racial
prejudice and unfair business practices of the man-
ager of the Syria Mosque. Recently, the situation has
gotten out of hand, according to PPC. The group is
boycotting the Syria Mosque until the matter is
resolved.

According to Gina Miller, assistant director of
student activities, the problem is two-fold: Syria
Mosque manager Dorothy Steele, the person with
whom the PPC works to schedule programs and
concerts for the benefit of students, embraces racist
views which members of the PPC do not think are
morally sound to support. In addition, the PPC
believes that Steele’s business practices only compli-
cate matters.

Steele strongly disagrees. She said that the PPC
and the Syria Mosque have a good relationship that
stands on its reputation. She said that black concerts
have been held\in the Mosque in the past and there
have never been any problems with’ the university.

According to PPC, however, there have been corn-
plaints that Steele has subjected PPC members to
unwarranted name—calling, including racial slurs.
This was the last straw as far as the PPC was
concerned.

According to Miller, Steele’s business practices
have put the PPC in a difficult position. For
instance, Miller said that if a person were to call the
Syria Mosque for information, he would be told by
Steele that no such event was to be held. Steele,
however, said that event announcements are sup-
posed to be made by Pitt or those involved, and that
tickets are to be sold through the university.

After many attempts to remedy the situation, the
PPC wrote a letter of concern to the Syria Mosque
Improvement Association. The PPC, however,
received no response. At the beginning of this term,
the group requested that Andy Smith, director of the
student activities, do something. Smith later called
the director of the Shriners, the group that owns the
Mosque. g

The PPC has taken a dramatic step to highlight a I
problem that it believes exists. It’s now up to
Mosque management to determine the validity of
that complaint. It’s an issue that demands serious,
thorough treatment——by all involved.

It looks as though there might be a solution in
sight. The Shriners are going to bring the matter up
at their next executive board meeting.

It is clear that the situation has to be rectified; if
not, PPC members have resolved not to go back to
the Syria Mosque. The Mosque is an excellent facil-
ity for concerts, dance groups and similar events.

The PPC has taken a_dramatic step to highlight a
problem that it believes exists. It’s now up to
Mosque managementto determine the validity of
that complaint. It’s an issue that demands serious,
thorough treatment—by all involved. Until it's
settled, the entertainment scene will be a little
dimmer in Oakland. '

Dear Editor:

I want to thank The Pitt
News for its'Sept. 17 editorial,
“Less Than Civil," which sen-
sitively and intelligently pond-
ers the matter of civil
disobedience in relation to a
legal proceeding in which Iwas
recently involved.

Richard J. Barnet has
remarked that “the very mean-
ing of sovereignty which states
guard so jealously is the magi-
cal power to decide what is or is
not a crime.” Naturally, states
are unlikely to decide that what
they do, pay corporations to do,
or order citizens to do is crimi-
nal. Who, therefore, is to call
the state accountable when it
prepares and suborns others to
prepare to commit crimes of
great magnitude?

Governments are generally
recognized as legitimate so long
as they can obtain consent from
those they govern. But that con-
sent is not unconditional. The
Bill of Rights to our Constitu-
tion provides that “the enumer-
ation in the -Constitution of
certain rights shall

\

others retained by the people.”

alluded to rights of conscience.

1982, I went to Hillman Library to

this university’s administration to
allow an event such as the Great
Bed Race to be located directly in

library!

Students have a tough cnollgh
time finding a decent place to study
as it is, but these outrageous distur-
bances should not have to be toler-
ated. Surely, another location
could have been chosen for this
event which would not have dis-
turbed students in a library. This
university is supposed to encour-
age learning, not hinder it!

I hope that in the future the uni-
versity will try to have a little more
consideration for its students, who
are supposed to be what this uni-

It is indeed a sad commentary

hours of 4 and 6:30 p.m. in the

Untruths

I Dear Editor:

In the last week The Pitt News
has written some bad press about
the IFC and the situation sur-
rounding the Zeta Beta Tau inci-
dent. Also in the last week The Pitt
News has included some un-truths
about the IFC and the Zeta Beta
Tau incident. Let us first examine
the article published on Wednes-
day, Sept. I5. In the very first sen-
tence the writer states that
“several” fraternities were
involved. In no way does an inci-
dent that involves two fraternities
represent “several Pitt fraterni-
ties.” Throughout the article, the
writer has relied upon second-hand
information and hearsay to make
up the bulk of her story. With
reports that the incident was a
“near riot” and that those involved
“may have numbered 300,” one
immediately questions the validity
of the rest of her story. On page
eight of that issue there is a cartoon
lampooning fraternity behavior
when such incidents occur. This is
a cheap shot at the fraternity system
here at Pitt, which is always
actively involved in community-
oriented projects.

In Friday's edition of The Pitt
News (Sept. 17) there is an article
about ZBT being sanctioned. The
articleclearly states that ZBT “has
been put on probation by the Inter-

Dear Editor:
Had the article appearing on
page six of=the Monday, Sept. 20
edition of The. Pitt News entitled
“Enforcing a Code of Silence” not
been such a blatant example of
“yellow journalism,” I might have
found it to be somewhat
amusing--a mundane piece of _fic-
tion, not uﬁlike the work of Alger
Hiss. For, indeed, it is fiction. I
must admit, however, that I am
somewhat surprised to find that
some journalists, viz. Christina
Clinton, still adhere to the wizened
W.R. Hurst maxim that, if news
doesn't exist, fabricate it. To be
more succinct,  Clinton’s arti-
cle seems better suited to Backspace
magazine, with all of the other fic-
tion, rather than to The Pitt News.
Of course it is well known that
the Greek system is but a front for
La Casa Nostra with Don Bardol
presiding as the “Godfather.” In
fact, all Greeks, myself included,
are ruthless, untrustworthy and
sureptitious-—“cut from the same
cloth” as Alphonso Capone, as it
were. You may, however, be,sur-
prised to learn many Greeks are
clean-cut, All-America boys who
are future leaders. Many of us are
even in the University Honors Pro-
gram. Furthermore, I find the
innuendos advanced by'Ms. Clin-
ton to be an affront to myself and to

fraternity Council.” I am the secre-
tary for the IFC and could have
easily told The Pitt News that this
is simply not true, had they taken
the time to check with me or
anyone else on the IFC.

Finally we come to the article in
Monday’s (Sept. 20) edition The
Pitt News. The writer persists in
saying that two out of 21 fraterni-
ties constitute “several.” The writ-
er goes on to maintain that the IFC
has a “conspiracy of silence.” As I
have stated before, I am a member
of the IFC exec board and I have
never engaged in this so-called con-
spiracy. No one from The Pitt
News ever asked my comment con-
cerning the situation. Had anyone
from‘ The Pitt News taken any
amount of time-to askime for com-
ment, I would have been glad to tell
them what I know. It was an out-
right lie to say that the IFC has
maintained any conspiracy of
silence when at least one of its
members was available for

COITIYHCTII.

The same writer also stated that
the IFC and fraternity presidents
have contacted the newspaper for
coverage of some Greek function.
That is true. The Pitt News must
admit that when the Greeks raise

’ large sums of money for charity or

help out in any other community-
oriented project, it is never placed

all fraternity and sorority
members. In fact, when your repor-
ters begin to libel your own adviser
in order to “spice up” a story, it
merely reinforces what I stated ear-
lier about “yellow journalism.”

Ms. Clinton ends her article with
a particularly ludicrous statement.
It inspires me to ask this question:
If she must guess about the article
which she hasjust written, does the
article merit publication? In all
sincerity, I derive no pleasure from
ripping Ms. Clinton's “argu-
ments” to shreds. In fact, I find it
appalling that I, or anyone, should
seriously have t.o question the
verity of an article appearing in
The Pitt News.

I am sure that Ms. Clinton would

not enjoy bad publicity. Should a
fraternity or the IFC enjoy such
dubious publicity any more so?
What Ms. Clinton appears to forget
is that we all enjoy the protection
afforded to us by the Fifth Amend-
ment, i.e., we all have the right to
reserve our comments to members
of the press. After all, the First
Amendment guarantees vou the

in headlines across the front page
such as the incident at Zeta Beta
Tau was. The writer also wonders
aloud whether the IFC purposely
imposed silence on its members, or
that statements made are a plot to
pacify The Pitt News. This letter is
being written through free will and
without the explicit knowledge or
approval from anyone in the IFC.

At this time let me explain the
IFC’s position. We are investigat-
ing what happened at ZBT on Sat-
urday the eleventh. Until we sort
out the facts from the rumors, we
cannot make a definite statement.
We will be glad to comment on
what we know and The Pitt News
is more than welcome to attend our
regularly scheduled meetings. All
that we ask is some time to fully
investigate the matter and make
our decision based upon that infor-
mation. Until then, our remarks
will be sketchy and seem incom-
plete because we simply don’t have
all the facts. If The Pitt News is
really interested in qualityjournal-
ism instead of attention-grabbing
headlines, it will allow us to do our
work unhindered by misleading
articles and un-truths that seem to
have become regular fare through-
out the past week.

right toprint whatever tripe you
construe as being newsworthy. I
truly wonder whether or not this
letter will be considered news-
worthy by you.

It bears no suggestion of scandal
or controversy——it lacks, in short,
the sensationalism which makes
Ms. Clinton’s article the sort of
material j which you, apparan-
tly(sic), so avidly seek. I would
poit(sic) out, merely, that it is a
newspaper's chief concern to
report the news, not the unsubstan-
tiated assumptions of muck-raking
journalists. And I do hope that the
same form of “cronyism” which
Ms. Clinton so ineptly attacks will
not prevent you from publishing
this letter, unaltered. I should hate
to be forced to add hypocracy (sic)
to this long list of tirades. Finally, I
feel that it might be appropriate to
close this letter with some sound
advice: Look before you lcap——or
you may land somewhere totally
unexpected. I do hope you will
raise your standards.

Dear Editor:_

Israel was right in invading
Lebanon to rid it of the PLO. They
were wrong to shell civilians; send-
ing troops in on foot would have
caused the deaths of more soldiers,
but would have saved more civilian
lives. Israel was also wrong to back
the Lebanese Phalangists and was
horribly wrong to allow them into
Arab refugee camps. Israeli Prime
Minister Menachern Begin and
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
should resign and any Israeli sold-

ier involved in those events should ’

be prosecuted.

Thomas Daniel's "letter pub-
lished in Wednesday’s Pitt News
has no bearing on any of this. It is
not a political or ethical analysis. It
is just a spate of anti-semitic rav-
ing. Presumably The Pitt News

knew what it was doing when it
published Daniel's line, “No peo-
ples’ God will sanctify the Jews’
will toward excessive wealth and
profit..."

I find it hard to understand the
editorial thinking in this regard.
May we have an explanation? Was
there a shortage of letters for the
Wednesday edition so that The Pitt
Newshad to print that one or what?
I'd like to know, please.

Obnoxious Disturbances

Dear Editor:

As I read the letter written by-
Theron D. Imbrie in last Fr1day’s
Pitt News concerning the religious
crusader, I could not help but relate
with his view. You see, I too am_a
victim of “outside interference in
the course of my studies” as I am
convinced are hundreds of other
dorm students. I too “strongly re-
sent this unnecessary obnoxious
disturbance” caused by thought-
less students who feel pleasure
from turning up the volume Of
their stereos. ~ _ A

It is nearly impossible to study in
my Quad room with these uncar-
'ing students behind the volume
controls. Yes, I could go to Hil-
lman Library, but we all know that
the library is asocial spot to hear
the senseless chatter about how
overworked we all are and to what
degree everyone was drunk on Sat-
urday night.

"I do not think that any of us can
imagine a mature adult grinning

deviously, facing his speakers out-

side so that the entire Quad and/or
Towers
from hearing a particular song. (I
would trade this noise for the noise
pollution on Forbes Ave. any day.)

So, what can be done about this
senseless behav1or—bolt down the

windows, issues fines, kick offend-
ers off campus? No,-I think and
hope that the Pitt students are
above this:

Maybe we could try being
mature while maintaininga sense
of consideration. After all, I would
feel guilty if I ruined a dedicated
student’s‘ valuable studying time
for the sake ofsselfishly demonstrat-
ing that I have a quality stereo or to
convince the entire Quad popula-
tion that my new single by Joan
Jett or AC/DC is more educational
than reading a textbook or study-
ing for an exam. A

Have an interesting, slightly ironic
observation to make? Contrary to
popular belief, The Pitt News is
not all seeing or knowing
(although we would like to think
so at times) and we need your
input. Put simply,-this is your
column, your voice. It reflects your
concerns, your gripes, and your
thoughts on matters of local and
international importance.

The Pitt News opinion and
column pages are under new man-
agement and it is the opinion of
this management that these pages

ear Reader,

will be expanded to offer a varied
spectrum of columns dealing with
even more varied ideas. Iespecially
extend the invitation to faculty
members and university instruc-
tors to submit columns expressing
opinions or news analyses so that
the rest of the university commun-
ity can benefit from well-
articulated and structured

THE FLESHTONES
Heaven
September 16, 1982

By SCOTT MERVIS

NYC's The Fleshtones, as you
probably don't know, play
something akin to the kind of
music. you would find in a Fran-
kie Avalon movie. It's fraternity
rhythm 'n blues to be played on
the beach at those parties where
everyone looks like he stepped
out of a postcard in his plaid ber-
mudas. But there was some-
thing very different about the
_way it was presented and
received. First of all, Heaven,
whose decor is in glaring con-
trast with its Thursday night
clientele, isn't exactly Malibu.
And second, I guess due to the
circumstances of the radioactive
'80s, The Fleshtones make you
feel more as though you're
being ravaged by a tidal wave.
It's not surprising that there
were only about two handfuls of
people there, who, while the stage
was not in use, just kind of stood
around looking as.if they didn't
know where they were. It didn't
seem like anything eventful could
happen. The band's airplay is
limited to WRCT, and they are

But, Peter Zaremba, whose hair

to notice the scarcity of people.

always trying to squeeze. The
Fleshtones were so raw and
rowdy that at certain climactic
moments the only thing approp
riate, if Zaremba arrived at the
mike stand on time,were breathy
shrieks or "whoa yeaaahs!"
Their short set was like a guer-
illa attack with each song pound-
ing into another, leading up to the
sly party—pop of "Roman Gods,"
and then into encore "Stop Fool-
ing Around" where sax and har-
monica sparred at center stage.
Stepping back an hourwas The
Phones, a Minneapolis band, who
supplied the more fashionable,
’ electronic waves with danceable
precision that inspired no one to
dance. But thatwas okay because
they were very listenable, they
danced nice and they became a
guitar—powered symphony on the
theme from "Mission Impossible."
I think what we need in Oak-
land instead of frat brawls is The
Fleshtones every Friday night.

nextdayto tellaboutit? Decent,
huh? _

That's what about'10,000 kids
got to do last week and thanks
to a couple of "just right" per-
formances by Greg Kihn and
Rick Springfield, it won't soon
be forgotten by any of us ado-
lescents. The two quite simply
came out and did what they do
with lots of enthusiasm and
sincerity——and that's a helluva
lot more than we get from folks
in other walks of life, not to
mention more than we usually
ask of ourselves. So (an the "I'm
too mature for Rick Springfield"
bullshit and learn a little about
what rock 'n' roll can do.

After keeping its lid on for a
decade, the Civic Arena has
gone open-air—the Debartolos
discovering that mother nature
petitions the P.U.C. for rate
hikes less frequently than
Duquesne Light——so that when
Greg Kihn stepped out onto
stage in near sunny conditions,
the audience didn't know quite

how to act. Greg, however, did, ,

plowing headlong into a 45 min-
ute set that by its end had won
over cheerleaders from the
entire tri—state area who were
up and wrigglin' in gyrations
that took about four years off
my age.

Opening a rock concert for an
audience that's probably never
seen one ain't easy, but it took
Greg Kihn a mere song and a
half to make the introduction
and the kids caught on quick,
impressing me withhboth their
receptiveness to and knowledge
of Kihn's material. Amazing
how the attention span of a
crowd increases when most of
them show up sober.

In less than an hour, Kihn
played all of his hits, "The Brea-
kup Song," "Testify," "Happy
Man," introduced another batch
of white kids to "Higher and
Higher" and "Just My Imagina-
tion"(a.k.a. Motown)—and in

between danced with, joked to,
and generally coaxed and
caressed an audience into being
a friend.

Twenty minutes later Rick
Springfield emerged stage left,
looking a resplendent 33 years
old in radioactive yellow, and
the females of this town sud-
denly wanted more than friend-
ship. Nothing short of a pound
of flesh would curb their
hungers. That he even bothers
to sweat, let alone put on a great
performance, in the face of such
mindless devotion is
commendable.

Springfield knows how to
play off a crowd, he utilizes the
stage, he looks and acts athletic,
and lastly, and to many least
importantly, he can play. Like
the Australian lady that pre-
ceded him into the Arena‘,
Springfield's got polish and his
concert practically glowed
because of it——not a prop out of
place here, not a movement
unexpected, right up to the
revved up black sedan that sped
him away. This was prescrip-
tion persona—-Dr. Noah Drake
style.

Few people were there to hear
innovation and so the material,
songs like "Calling All Girls,"
"Don't Talk To Strangers,"
"Jesse's Girl," etc., etc.,. were
provided true to form and all
loved it. I loved it. I stood there
amidst a sea of Iordache, in the
glare of braces, through the
waffs of cheap perfume, think-
ing "why not?" While all of sub-
urbia grew dark and Ataris lie
dormant, a bunch of kids were
learning of a magic called
rock'n'roll, and who knows,
maybe next week's lunch
money will escape Ms. Pac-Man
and Mr. Frogger and go instead
to a copy of "Just My Imagina-
tion" and a kid willgasp"what is

Greg Kihn Tells ALL!

M

AND
MOM

By FRANK DIGIACOMO &
TODD ERKEL

As Greg Kihn's fiery "Radio On"
medley draws his show to a close, a
man from stage left motions for us to
come backstage, where he instructs
us to wait for him to get us valid
backstage‘ passes (the first ones
issued were from last night's show).
Back here, the atmosphere is one of
tension—as compared to the nubile
hysteria that reigned in the seating
area outside. Security is worried
about getting Rick Springfield on and
off the stage safely (maybe they're
afraid of his returning to prepubes-
cent stages if he's besieged by t_oo
much jailbait.) Springfield can be seen
running in and out of View followed
closely by severalbodyguards.

Among this sea ofgritted teeth and
sweaty palms weaves a man with a
terminal grin on his face. Still
drenched from the show, Greg Kihn
smiles his way into an open room to
cool down. Kihn hasa definite right
to be happy, since the release of RocI<-
ihn Roll Band and its subsequent hit
single "The Breakup Song," he and
the band have finally been allowed
into Club Success. In addition, the
follow-up album, Kihntinued, and
Kihn's rambunctious set tonight
could only add to the testament that
Berkeley's son rocks hard.

A half hour later we're led into the
room and introduced to Greg—still
smiling. The rest can be "likihned” to
a soliloquy-a la "rockihn roll"...
SHOWCASE: What's it like toplay to an
audience of fourteen year—olds?

KIHN:_It was a real learning expe-
rience. I really wanted to do it
though...there were many tours we
could have taken this summer, but I
thought this would be a lot of fun,
because playing for an audience of
girls between the age of twelve and
eighteen is a (pause) beautiful thing
(laughs). Like I said, a lot of these
people have never seen a real rock-n-
roll show before—many have never
even heard of us, and it's real satisfy-
ing when they go crazy at the end.
Did you like it better than headlining?
Well, when we headline it's a chal-
lenge, but it's different, you know,
because they know all the songs and
they're already going to like it. But
this is a lot more pure, and I kind of
like it.

But, do you prefer this?

No, I don't, but it's a real good thing‘
to bringthe band together. We're
playing better now than we've ever
played before. Also, I've learned a lot
about the commercial stuff. I've
. always disdained the merchandising
of rock'n’roll, but now that I'm out
with Springfield, I've grown to
appreciate it. One of the pillars of
rock-n-roll, apparently, is the adula-
tion of young girls, and I think it's

..-1-."

important that one learn how to do
that in one's repertoire. It's like, the
menu has to be varied, you know? I
think we're one of the few bands that
can go out and play, and there's no

K

  

trip involved—it just works. So, I
think you gotta be able to play to
everybody———you don't -have to
change your music ——you just have to
be able to do it confidently in front of
everyone. That's pure rock and roll.
Buddy Holly, for instance——I'm sure
Sid Vicious owned a Buddy Holly
record; my mother owned a Buddy
Holly record. I mean, that's pretty
much the spectrum. That's the truth

   

for me, so I want to get to the essence
of it—everybody should be able to
understand it.

In other words, musie is universal, right?
Right, most of the movements in

1

music are fashion movements, and
...they're good and all, but the music»
hasn't changed. Soft Cell is the same
chords as Buddy Holly. The instru-
ments and the style are different, but
the same essence is still there.

How do you describe your band?

Well, ever since the "Breakup Song"
we've been doing so well, but prior to
that we were the kind ofband that
would take any gig. In the old days,
we used to be the house band at the
Long Branch——so, one night we'd
open for Patti Smith; the next night
Toots and the Maytals; and the next
night Pete Seeger. And it was just
like, ‘Is there a gig? Is there fifty

job; with the CYO, or opening for
Black Sabbath. Literally, the first
major concert we played was at Win-
terland opening for Black Sabbath.
Nooooo!

Yeah. It was a fluke because Cheap
Trick was supposed to open, but one
of the guys got sick, and they called
us literally two hours before the gig
and told us that we were the only
band they knew of that could get
down here, set up and open without a
sound check in that amount of time.
We already had a gig later that night
opening and backing john Lee
Hooker, but we still said, ‘Sure.’
Yeah...Bill Graham called me, and I
said, 'F--- Bill, I'll be there! What's
the address?’ We walked onstage and
didn't even know who we were open-
ing for. As it turned out, we opened

''...and so the hot dog says to the beer

for a brutal, candle-burning crowd of
Black Sabbath fans (wild laughter).
And then, we didn't even look back,
we just jumped in the car and headed
for the Iohn Lee Hooker gig...So,
anyway, now that the ”Breakup
Song” is a hit, we get offered tours all
the time, and since our work ethic is,
‘We want to work,’ we just choose
who we want to work with. Our tour
with Journey gave us a lot of expo-
sure, and we did this gig to learn
about thirteen year-old girls
(smirks)...I guess we're the kind of
guys that if somebody asked us to

bucks and we were free——well, we'd

do it. That's rock-n-roll, man.

Has all this performing helped the harzdgrow?
Does it affect you in thestudio?

Oh yeah, definitely, the band is much
more mature now than ever before.
We've played real loud and heavy;
real soft; and with every inflection;
so that when we went into the studio
to do Kihrltiaued we didn't even think
about what the sound of the songs
would be. Instead of having a precon-
ceived concept, we just took it song
by song and we did whatever the
individual songwanted. We loosened
up a lot when we went into the stu-
dio. For instance, we did "Tell Me
Lies” five different ways until we

realized it was best with a reggae
backing. -
Does your record companygive you that much
freedom? W V
Part of being the only band on
Beserkley records is the fact that we
can do anything we want. We could
go and recut Tommy if we wanted to.
It's really loose and I'm grateful for
that. To me, my artistic freedom is
very precious to me. Someone’s

‘ always trying to lure us away from it,

too, but I realize that what I'm doing
is a privilege and I want to make the
most of it. Being successful is only
one aspect of music. You don't have
to be successful to be a great musi-
cian. If you form a band to make
money and be successful—that’s the

wrong reason. But, if you form a
band to play good music and over the
years you become successful...

That kind of philosophy doesn't get around
much these days...

Because there's problems in the
industry. You read a lot of bad press
about the music industry, but really,
it's the only realistic attitude.

Do you...

I tell y0u...something I was thinking

about. Let's say you wanted to start 9

city——maybe you’re the mayor of
Poughkeepsie or something like
that——and you wanted to put your
city on the map’. First, think about
bands who, like, go on tour and bring
all the money they make on the tour
back home, and put it in the bank.
That means that a city like San Fran-
cisco must make more money off tax-
ing rock-n-roll than say, Dupont. So,

tax breaks up the kazotz to rock
bands——l’d advertise it in Rolling Stone.
I'd get every band to come and live
here and they would plug millions of
dollars into this town. I'd build a f-~--
Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame and have
bumperstickers that say ”Rock City "
or something....

But...
Think about this man; rock turns
more money than any other f-——-- art

form. In fact, I'll bet it turns more
money than all of the other art forms

combined. '50, how come, with the E

amount of money that rock draws in,
there's not one theater in the world
built for rock-n-roll. Think about
that. There's opera places in Peoria,
for chrissakes, there's T.S. Elliot pla-
ces, but not one place in the world for
rock-n-roll. Reagan——-I mean the
guy's f-——-- in show business——why
doesn't he name a‘ national rock
theater? It's insane-—-I think we
should start lobbying right now for
the recognition of rock-n-roll. We
know we're the most important art
form. Nobody’s even close——we’re
kicking everyone’s butt....

I mean Bo Diddley never made that
much money, but he's more impor-
tant to me than Ezra Pound. Ezra
Pound probably made more money-

lum isn't he? So, that's about it

VOYEUR
Kim Carnes
EMI-America

I admit it. Kim Carnes is one
of my guilty pleasures. I really
shouldn't like that hoarse, gra-
velly voice, but I do. It makes
sad, "it's over" ballads believa-
ble, but also sounds great in a
rock song. At least, to me. So if
you don't like her voice, you
might as well stop reading this
article. However, if you toler-
ated its rasp in last year's Mis-
taken Identity, there's a lot to like
on the new album, Voyeur.

On Voyeur, Carnes continues
the move towards rock 'n roll
that she started on tracks "Bette
Davis Eyes," "Hit And Run" and
"Let's Break The Rules Tonite"
from Mistaken Identity. The main

difference between the two-

albums is that there are less of
the bland pop/ballad type of
songs and simply more good
songs in general; the sound is a
lot harder. 4 ..

First, the really good songs.
On side one, my picks are
"Voyeur," "Looker" and "Brea-
kin’ Away From Sanity."
"Voyeur" and "Looker" are two
more portraits in the Carnes
gallery, created by a mixture of
intelligent and poignant lyrics,
Carnes’ emotional voice and
heavy use of synthesizer. "Brea-
kin’ Away From Sanity" is a chil-.
ling, beautiful ballad about a
relationship that is driving one
of the people involved insane.
Oﬁ giaa two, "The Arrange-
ment" and "The Thrill Of The
Grill” clearly stand out as the
best tracks, with "Merc Man"
added as a personal favorite.
Here, Carnes sounds as if she's
having a great time as she rat-
tles some really silly lyrics in a
teasing voice with precise

rhythm. Like "The Thrill Of

.The Grill," it's a good-time

SOI'1g.-’

The decent songs (they won't
make you stand up and take
notice) are "Say You Don't
Know Me,” "Does It Make You
Remember” and "Undertow."
The bad song on the album is
"Take It On The Chin," a self-

consciously "cute" song that is
just plain stupid.

But the album, for the most
part, is a refreshing break from
some of the sludge that has
dominated the charts. So if you
have $7 you didn't know you
had and liked "Bette David
Eyes," go ahead. I think you'll
like it.

THE GOLDEN AGE
OF WIRELESS
Thomas Dolby
Capital

I don't know who this guy is,
where he came from, how he got
here, how long he'll stay or why I
bought this album. All I know is
that ,1 think it's stuck to my
turntable . The beauty and pre-
cision of this album is breath-
taking, and Thomas Dolby
places a lot of heart into the
workings of synthesizers, wave
computers and something called
drum programs. Dolby looks
something like a physicist or
someone you would trust to
open the back of your TV set
and restructure your wiring.
So, you are given the comforting
feeling of listening to someone
who you think knows what he's
doing. .

The album opens with a song to
slap your thighs to and dance

‘ around your living room to in a

futuristic way. "Europa and the
Pirate Twins" blends his innova-
tive electronic percussion with an
exquisite vocal track of overdubs,
shrieks and whispers, while
synthesizers and a harmonica
soar seductively through the
gaps. From here, the music
slides into "Flying North" and
"Weightless,"titles which sug-
gest their dreamy qualities and
the way they make you feel if
‘you turn the volume all the way

up.
For the rest of "The Golden

Age Of Wireless," Dolby con-
tinues to deliver spirited pop
music using the most modern
means available. Dolby's voice is
melodic and always c.omfortable
with the futuristic rhythms and
ethereal keyboards, and as a
result, his message becomes per-
sonal and very human: "Switch
off the mind and let the heart
decide who you were meant to
he." Three cheers for the
underdog.

SIGNALS
Rush
Mercury

This Canadian trio is one of
"my all-time favorites, and it

looks as though my heroeshave

-stumbled.

A progression through space
fantasy and the mystical work-
ings of the human brain has
brought Rush to a new frontier.
That frontier is today's society.
The concept is fine; it is the
music that is discouraging.
First, too manynew styles are
tried in one album. Music

_.ranges. . from .rock,. . to. ..the

too much going on; the musi-
cally simple, three man attack
was one of the band's qualities
that I truly appreciated.

The band itself hasn't
changed though. Geddy Lee still
sings in his distinct, high-
pitched voice; his keyboards
sound new wavish at times;
Alex Lifeson is his normal self,
delivering fiery guitar leads and
flowing rhythm bridges; Neil
Peart offers his powerful drum-
ming and his pointed lvrics.

This album takes some get-
ting used to; even then, mostof
it is mediocre.

GEORGE HOLZER

NORTH BY NORTHWEST
Tom Robinson
I.R.S.

The time has come for Tom
Robinson. For several years
now, "this prolific songwriter
and poet has been all but
ignored in America, while gar-
nering some very healthy praise
in the UK. His various solo pro-
jects and recent collaborations
with Sector 27 have yielded
some consistently excellent

albums, while his initial musical
offerings with the Tom Robin- a

son Band have often proved
controversial (Robinson wrote

readed isco. Second, there is

NOSNIHOH WOJ.

"Glad To Be Gay"), though not
at all lacking in quality.
Robinson's forte is his ability
to write magical lyrics that
remain standing after the mus-
ic's gone. On North By Northwest,
this ability shines ever bril-
liantly as Robinson teams with
Peter Gabriel for two songs,
"Atmospherics" and "Merrily
Up on High," that pulse with his
sharp imagery and Gabriel's
offbeat line of thought. The
remaining songs also rely heav-
ily on Robinson's use of street
images which seems to be -a
major device of his songwriting
(Listen to"1967 (Seems So Long
Ago)"). Standouts on North By
Northwest include "Those Days,"
"Duncannon," "Love Comes,"
"Atmospherics," "Merrily Up

‘On High," and the fantastic‘

"Looking For A Bonfire."

Music—wise, the album is also
very sound and densely
arranged with some excellent
keyboard work by Robinson and
sax charts by Richard Mazda,
who also produces the album.

So, for those tired of cliched,
bland lyrics with equally blase
music, Tom Robinson has got a
lot more to offer—— if only some-
one would pay attention.

there is no mention of what part
of speech each of these bits of
verbage is. d .
But just to prove that this is a
great book, here are a list of
words gleaned from the pages
of Words to help get around this
old college campus in a little bet-
ter shape. Note that while the
definitions are Dickson's, the
commentaries on how they
relate to Pitt are mine.
Frottage: The practice of rubbing
one"s genitals against another
person's, usually of the opposite
sex and usually in public. Also
used to describe the technique
of rubbing a raised design with a
crayon and using a piece of
paper to produce an image. A lot
of this goes on at frat parties,
C]’s Happy Hour, the backseats
of cars on the weekends and on
the benchesoutside the Quad.
Iconolagny: Sexual stimulation by
means of pictures. A condition
common among anthro majors,
and readers of Plat/Girl, Playboy,
etc.
Urtiralion: Flagellation with
fresh nettles. According to
Dickson, urtication was a com-
mon means to arouse sexual
appetites in ancient Rome. Here
at Pitt we do much the same
thing with liquor, and illegal
substances.
Camglollisrn: A lascivious kiss; a
tongue kiss. Also frequently
seen at Cl's, frats, the back seats
of cars and on benches outside
the Quad.
Beaver: Hal It's not what you
think. Dickson defines it as the
movable part of a suit of armor
that protects the mouth and
chin. At Pitt this word is often
seen in Shakespeare, and can

also be observed at Carnegie

Museum.

Netters Rally To Defea
Rival Duquesne Dukes

By TIM DISNGER

“It was a long, cold, damp match
that finished _under the lights,"
head tennis coach George Diel-

fenbach said after Wednesday’s
match with Duquesne, “but the
team pulled together and played
real well.”

It was a different story from Pitt’s
9-0 blow-out of Carnegie-Mellon
last Monday as the Lady Panthers
came back from a 4-2 deficit to
squeak past Duquesnie 5-4.

Pitt came out of the doubles
competition with a slim 2-1 lead,
but‘ then Pitt’s top three women,
seniors Cathy Jacobson, Lisa Lafu-
ria and Miriam Goltz, all dropped
their singles in fhes to give the
Dukes a two-match lead wi_th only
three matches left.

Then freshman Kristine Peck-
man and senior Linda Stadler came
through with wins, tying the
match and leaving all eyes on Pitt’s
Jody Mattioli and Duquesne’s

Cathy Portmann.

  

“Jody wanted the match more
than Portmann,” Dieffenbach
said. “She played smarter and more
aggressive. She rose to the occasion
for Pitt and she won the match for
us. _

After dropping the first set 4-6,
Mattioli came back to pound Port-
mann 6-2, 6-1, winning her match
and giving the Panthers the 5-4
victory. ‘

Dieffenbach also praise Jacob-
son and Lafuria for their comeback
win over Duquesne’s Vivian Pan-
sino and , Barb Gesenhues in
doubles.

The Lady Panthers record moves
to 2-0 as they await the arrival of
Robert Morris for their 2 p.m.
match at the Trees Hall courts
today. The match is a rescheduling
of yesterday's postponed match.

Panthers To Face

Deadly Illinois

/

By scon DELLETT

What has happened to the once-
invincible Pitt defense? As the Pan-
thers enter l)attle tomorrow against

Illinois at Memorial "Stadium. in I
Chainpaign, people are pondering

the state of the defense.
Looking at the statistics doesn_’t
ease anyone‘s mind.

The Panther defense has given‘

up 276 yards passing so far, or an
average of 138 yards per game,
which‘ isn’t all that bad, especially
when the opposition is completing

‘only 38 percent of the passes

attempted. The defense against the
run, however, has been downright
bad. The No. l defense against the
run two years in a row, the Pan-
thers, have allowed North Carolina
and Florida State to gain a total of
325 yards. Usually Pitt’s opponents
didn’t gain that much yardage
until the eighth game of the season

The Panthers’ main concern Sat-
urday will be Tony Eason. The
junior-college transfer quarterback
passed for 3,360 yards last year,
completing 248 of 406 passes for 20
touchdowns. This year, Eason has
not missed a beat, hitting 68 of »l 10
passes for 836 yards in three games.

Passing Attack

Eason will be throwing to receiv-
ers Mike Martin, Oliver Williams
and tight end Tim Brewster.

Eason also throws a lot to his
backs, evidenced last year as he
completed 23 of .37 for 203 against

the Panthers last year. But head.

coach Mike. White will not be
afraid to run as in the past.

Seniors Mike Murphy and Joe
Curtis will start, but there are four
other reserves who have some
glowing credentials. Ray Ryles,
one of the many transfers White
has brought in _during his three
yearsat Champaign, was a Florida
sprint champion. Dwight Beverly
is another fullback «and Mitchell

Brookins has scoredsix touch-i

doiwns so far in 1982.

The offensive line has had some '

problems with Syracuse and Mich-
igan State, but they have some big
people such as 6-7,’ 285-poilnd
tackle Steve Collier, 6-7, 250-pound
John Janata and 6-5, 265-pound
guard Bob Stowe.

The defense was also built by the
transfer route. Illinois_ is a team
with a great tradition on defense,
but White admits he'is an offense-
oriented coach. Still the defenseis
coming along.

Magnelli Grasps  

Center Position

By BRIAN BALK

He has the smallest hands on the
team. In fact he says, “my two sis-
ters got bigger hands than me.”
Yet, he plays the center position,
where the grip is most essential.
One wonders how he can do it.

When the name “Tony Mag-
nelli" appears, the bewilderment is
immediately erased. Small hands
and all, Magnelli gives a most
impressive performance, on and off
the playing field. i

Magnelli began his football

career at Sto Rox High School. He '

claims that his home town is so
small that “the only time we make
the news is when there is a- fire,
murder or when they close a porn
shop down.” ‘

While at Sto Rox,lthe' 6-3, 252 -

pound Magnelli excelled at both
center and defensive’ end. However,
his hopes of playing both ways
soon changed after he entered Pitt.

“See, there was this guy named
Hugh Green, and he, well, ahh...."
Needless to say, Magnelli’s efforts
were then concentrated totally on
offense.

After lettering his freshman year
as a long snapper for punts, it
appeared that nothing could stop
this potential star from progress-
ing. Nothing short of a truck, that
is.

“I went jogging one morning at
6:30. In fact it was the clay of my
sister's wedding," Magnelli said. "I
was right in from of my house
when I heard this horn blow. Well,
as I pushed off the truck to avoid
§€‘[l$lIt$1g_lI‘l

,.

  

   x

1

Even though he was able to see
his sisters wedding, Magnelli was
not able to play for his entire
sophomore year. However, he says
that the redshirt did him worlds of
good.‘

“I needed a year to mature, to get
myhead together,” he said. “Since
I came from such a small school, it
took at least a year and a half to get
adjusted athletically and‘academi-
cally,.’.’ Magnelli added. “The yearl
red-shirted really helped me.”

Part of the adjustment Magnelli
had to undergo was on the offen-
sive line, as he explains. ..

“Going from high school to col-
lege the biggest‘ transition to make
is on the offensive line, because
now you are allowed to use your
hands” Magnelli said. “Quarter-
backs still throw and running
backs still run, but it is a totally
different story for offensive
linemen.”

Center is certainly one of the
most dangerous positions. As Mag-
nelli is hunched over the ball, there
is a defensive noseguard ready to
pounce on the words of “Hut,
hut." However: this fear does not
affect his play.

“When you are out_on the field,
you don‘t have any time to think
about the other guy and how big he
is," he explained.

According to Magnelli, the key is
technique.

“We’re always thinking about
the blocking scene and concentrat-
ing on the defensive set-up,” Mag-
nell_i said. “But technique is 90
percent of it. If you have the right

technique you can usually beat

your guy.”

Thomas Carries The Statistics, Not The Glamour

By MAX REGULA

His feature_

I-Ierchel Walker’s injured thumb

made page one. Walker gets an
exclamation point. And I even
think I saw his picture in Sports

cover. He made page 46. His name
is Bryan Thomas. ‘

Thomas rushed for over 1,000
yards last year. You say you didn't
know that he rushed for that many
yards? That Curt Gowdy never told
you? That they never interrupted
Notre Dame’s highlights with the

Just ask him. You might have to

about his achievements in The
Press.

Thomas plays tailback for the
Panthers, the team we root-for on
weekends. He lines up a few yards
behind Marino. Look for him this
week and watch him closely. You
just might be surprised.

This summer I read that Thomas
runs a 4.8 forty. Ischat a tailback’s
time, or Jimbo Covert’s? Heck, I
run a 4.8 forty, too. Maybe Thomas
should write for this newspaper. I
iisn see it now...Biy BRYAN THOM-

Against North Carolina and
Florida State, I glanced at Thomas
on occasions. I thought that Jimbo
might outrun him on a sweep.
“C’mon Bryan," he might say, sig-
naling him forward, “we ain’t got
all day.” It would make a good
story.

Bryan Thomas isn’t the fastest

turns nothing into five yards better
than anyone in the game. If you get
a chance this Saturday, glance at
Thomas. See if he’s for real, if he's
all the things you never read about.
He is. I'd bet the game on it.

What T 0 Do On Sundays

By DALE MOORE

. In a gesture of incredible stupitl—
II)’, the National Football League
Players ‘ASSOCl2i[lOn has gone on
strike.

Unless you have been asleep or
in a chemistry lab all week, this
isn’t earthshaking news. While
being aware of this calamity, has
anyone given serious thought to
the consequences of this giant step
backward? Will the football fansof

America go into withdrawl at the
loss of their pastime?

Even with the strike, there will
still be football on television on
Sunday. Like every other good and
service in the United States, foot-
ball is being imported. NBC is pre-
pared to televise a Canadian
Football League doubleheader on
Sunday. 7

, Like the foreign car, foreign
football differs from the American
model. In the Canadian Football
League, there are 12 players on the
field at one time instead of 11 in the

American game. The offense gets
only three downs, compared to
four in the NFL. The field is twice

as wide and the end zones are 2.5.» t..

yards long.

There may be a place for David
Trout in the CFL. Because of the
long end zones, 21 field goal that is
off target must be returned. If it
isn't, the kicking team gets one
point. Confused? Don’t worry,
every one else is too.

This brings us to another ques-
tion. What can the people who

refuse to watch the foreign game

and want to see American football
do? No problem. just for these
patriotic fans, CBS is going to
rerun Super Bowl XVI, pitting the
San Fransisco 49ers against the

Spikers Challenge Rankings In Tournament

(‘By MARK A. SINDLER

Ranked versus unranked. The
difference between these two ideas
can mean prominence or obscuri-
ty.This distinction also carries var-
ying degrees of merit—particularly
if you’re a Pitt or Penn State volley-
ball coach.

The Nittany Lions, along with
Ohio State and Tennessee, are ven-
turing to Pitt this weekend for the
Pitt Classic. Before the four teams
meet tonight, the Lady Panthers
face arch-rival Penn State at 7 p.m.

Q" The duel is no less a strong bill-

ing than, say, Cooney vs.Holmes—
volleyball-speaking, that is. Penn
State is currently ranked 13th and
Pitt is nowhere ner the Top 20, but
would like to be—and St.ate’s coach
Russell R/ose said his squad’s rank
is a mere pittance.

“Our ranking is an ignorant
reflection of those putting our
team in the actual Top 20,” Rose

remarked. “This ranking is based
on our being an outstanding team
last year; we came within two
points of reaching the Final Four
in the championships. The whole
thing (polling) is just a media tool.
They didn’t even rank us last year
when we went undefeated in the
East.”

Pitt coach Shelton Collier sees
matters in a different light, saying
Pitt is an “unknown quality right
now. After this weekend, it will
remain to be seen whether we -reach
the rankings. This classic is second
in importance to the Big East
Championships and the NCAA’s."

To date, Penn State is sporting a
1-0 record with Kent State being its
only victim. Rose isn’t overly con-
cerned with this classic since. his
squad starts playing more competi-
tive programs after this weekend.

“Right now, we're only inter-

ested in getting the game time in, "

he said. “This will prepare us for

upcoming matches against Hous-

The latter two are nationally
ranked in the Top Five.

Whether he views Pitt as a
stepping-stone or not, apathy is
evidently present, which may not
be wise considering that the Lions
graduated five prominent players
last year. There is also the solid
self-reliance two Lady Panthers
possess. ,

Team captain Julie Gaul has
strong convictions. “Neither team

'will overpower the other,” she

stated, “but we're emotionally
stronger and have more of a core
going for us than they do. Three of
their starters graduated last year.
We’ll _have to be able to execute very
well, and in order for us to get
ranked, we have to beat them.”

Senior Robin Kukalis offers
assurances.

“We’re definitely going to win,”
she said confidently. "We have a

mental toughness about us and
have proved to ourselves——-based on
past tournament play—that we
know what we have to do to win.
Whatever it takes to beat them,
we've got it".

Collier explained that the Pitt-
Penn. State matchup features the
top two players in the East-Gaul
and Lori Bararick. Both were start-
ers in this summer's National

Sports Festival.

When measuring both team’s
strengths, Collier sees a fairly even
match.‘ He elaborated, “Both
squads will be relying on young
team members. They have sopho-
mores playing key roles. Judy
Young and Ulana Kohutiak are
our two sophomore spikers, and
Carmen Tapia is one of our top
blockers."

Currently, the Lady Panthers are
riding an 11-game win streak and

pionships. Is a third in the
makings?
“Ohio State and Tennessee both
have potential," Collier answered.
“Revenge will be a factor for both.
But right now, we can’t concern
ourselves with taking the classic.
We have to look at each -match on a
individual basis—one at a time.”
Collier will do this with a host of

injuries plaguing his team.

Diane Zack, the squad’s top
spiker, is weathering a rotator cuff
strain in her shoulder, Young has a
pinched nerve in her arm, Kukalis
hasn’t recovered 100 percent from a
recent pulled stomach muscle and
Pat Belcher, the top replacement

for the aforementioned, is ham-

pered by a knee injury.

Injuries not withstanding, the
Lady Panthers are set. When the
Nittany Lions come knocking, Pitt
will aim to get its foot in the door-

Magnelli Set At Center

continued from page seventeen

Magnelli said that the unsung
heroes of the offensive line are
finally getting their long-deserved

recognition. .

“This is the first year I played on
the line that we ever got recogni-
tion," Magnelli said. “The only
time they ever focused on the offen-
sive line was when we allowed a
sack or recovered a loose ball.

“You will always hear the TV
announcers say, ‘nice throw,’
or. ‘nice catch,’ but they forget
about the guys in the trenches who

-«(:9-Hare making sure he (the quarter-

back) can stand up back there,"
Magnelli humorously added about
recognition.

Magnelli has snapped all types
of balls in all types of weather, but
he never saw anything compared to
what the Panthers ran into last
weekend at Tallahassee.

“It was a monsoon," he said.

Although he had never practiced
snapping wet balls, Magnelli was
ready to face the challenge then.

“I told (Greg) Ganzer that I’m
not going to get the balls back there
pretty, but I'm going to get them
back there,” he said during last
week’s torrential downpour.

It would appear that college
football players would spend most
of their available practice time out
on the field. Magnelli explains it
differently.

“We spend as much time watch-
ing films of other teams as we do
running plays,” he added. “Prepa-
ration is everything."

Magnelli lives in Brackenridge
Hall with five non-football play-
ers. He labels his roommates as
“five regular students who are aca-

Living with roommates who are

not involved in football has its

benefits.

“When I come back from prac-
tice, they are always there to cheer
me up. They make me feel really

good,” hesaid.

Magnelli is an elementary educa-
tion major who can boast a 3.0
QPA. He hopes to teach school and
maybe go on to the administrative
level.

The Panthers rely heavily on
Magnelli to initiate the entire
offensive unit, but this is not a
burden on him. He said, “I don't
get as nervous whenever I know
people are relying on me.”

When the Panthers face Illinois
this Saturday, they will once again
rely on the talents of theicenter

junior defensive tackle Don
Thorp leads the team in tackles, 14,
and sacks, 3. The Panthers may
also see an imposing name on the
defense line. Mark Butkus is the
nephew of former lllini and NFL
great Dick Butkus. Butkus, who
backs up Throp, is fourth on the
team in tackles. The other starters
are tackle Dan Gregus and ends
Nick Epps and Ken Gillen.

Four of the top six tacklers on the
team are linebackers. Mike Wein-
grad is_ the starting middle line-
backer, Archie Carter and Clint
Haynes are at the outside spots.

The secondary will be r(‘sp0nsi-
ble to stop Dan Marino's aerials.
Free safety (Iraig Swoope has
picked off three passes so far this
season. ()ther starters are Dennis
Bishop, David Edwards and (Ilia-
rles Armstead.

The barefoot kicker has arrived
in (lhampaign. Mike Bass has done
an outstanding job since he took
his shoe and sock off his right foot.
This year he is seven out of seven in
field goals and he hit all M extra
points. Against Syracuse he hit a
career high four field goals, includ-
ing a 53-yarder, the longest of his
career. Punter (Jhris Sigourney has

done a creditable job. The left-
footed punter has averaged 43.7
yards per punt.

This may be a pivotal game for
the Panthers. If the defense can
shine as it has in years past and the
offense gets its gears going, Illnois
will be in for a long afternoon. But
if it performs like it did the last two
games of this season, the Panthers
will be in for another fight.
