Vandals Hit SG Offices

Mischief, But

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Vandals struck the third ﬂoor of
the Student Union late Wednesday
night, wreaking havoc in several
student government offices.

Vandals entered the Student
Government office in 305, the
Medical Action Committee office in
313 and that of the Legal Awareness
Committee in 320 Student Union.
Medical Action and Legal Aware-
ness are standing committees of
Student Government.

Although nothing was stolen, the
vandals reportedly overturned
desks and chairs and spread toilet
paper and masking tape throughout
the offices.

A Student Government spokes-
man reported there were also
envelopes suspended with tape

* Accessibl-er Programs Needed At Pitt

BY PAUL MATHEWS

Pitt could be required to make
costly building‘ renovations if
proposed federal regulations bar-
ring discrimination against handi-
capped persons are adopted by the
Department of' Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW), according to
Jack Hayes, -Pitt’s director of
Veteran Affairs.

The reg_ulations, which have yet
tobe signed by the new secretary of
HEW, Joseph Califano, are design-
ed to eliminate discrimination
against handicapped persons “in
any program or activity receiving
‘federal financial assistance.”

A With the job market becoming
increasingly tighter every year,

on-the-job experience is an essen- '

tial requirement for the college
graduate who wants to land a ggod,
high-paying job. . 
At Pitt, vitally needed career

Through this program, work
experience in. such areas as
fact-finding and research, indi-
vidual and group process, problem

Hayes said, in terms of accessi-
bility alone, that is, whether or not a
student with mobility constraints
can gain entrance to a University
building, the University could be
forced to spend in the neighborhood
of five to six million‘ dollars to make
its programs accessiblevfor handi-
capped students. t

-Jeff Parker, a Pitt student
confined to a wheelchair who works
in the Ofﬁce of Veteran Affairs and
who designed Access, the disabled
student’s external guide to Pitt’s
Oakland campus, said the proposed
regulations will not speciﬁcally
require all buildings to be
accessible; rather, they will require
all programs to be accessible.

“All Pitt will have to do, in the
event these regulations are passed,
is schedule those classes which
disabled students want to take in
buildingsthat are accessible, if it is
to meet accessibility require-
ments,” Parker said.

Parker said, however, accessi-
is a very individualistic
problem and therefore it is
impossible to make an overall
statement about which building is
accessible and which is not. -“A
building that is not accessible to me
may be accessible to another
disabled person -with a different
mobility constraint,” he said.

Of Pitt’s approximately 60
buildings, Parker said, only eleven,
such as the music building and
Alumni Hall, are inaccessible to
wheelchair students.

Hayes said his philosophy
concerning accessibility does not
advocate the immediate implemen-
tation of the proposed regulations.

Rather than doing nothing for
handicapped persons until the
proposed regulations are approved

-by Congress, which could be a long

time incoming, Hayes said, .A“Our

Ofﬁce of Veterans Affairs Director Jack Hayes proposes to maximize

the available accessible space on campus to aid disabled students rather
than the costly renovation of University property.

space currently available without
knocking down walls.”

Parker said the Ofﬁce of Veteran
Affairs prefers to deal with
accessible space that is already
available, stressing the positive
points of the space rather than just

' sitting back and labeling programs

inaccessible.

“It is easy to doreports that
suggest making sweeping architec-
tural modifications, such as knock-
ing down walls, but we feel it is
more important to maximize the
available accessible space to the
extent that it already exists,” he
said.

Tom Galante, Pitt’s -advisor for

disabled students, said Pitt, unlike‘

ther universit_i_e_s,

   

until either the federal or state
government gives them themoney
to make the architectural improve-
ments to make programs fully
accessible because, in effect, that
attitude is “putting the cart before
the horse.”

By working closely with the
Registrar's Ofﬁce, hayes said his
staff is usually able to, schedule
classes, which students with
mobility constraints want to take, in
Pitt’s accessible buildings.

Parker said the University is

_ making an active effort to improve

the conditions disabled students
must face on campus. The Physical

Cold Spell

BY MARK CELENDER

Sub-zero temperatures haven't
caused any‘ major heating or
maintenance problems at Pitt,
according to Alex Kaminsky, Pitt’s
director of plant services and
building maintenance.

“Besides minor problems like
leaking valves, there hasn't been
any major problems with the
steamlines,” Kaminsky said. “As
long as coal can be supplied to the
Belleﬁeld Steam Plant, Pitt will be
in good shape,” he said.

Kaminsky said 44 of the

University's buildings are heated _

by the Belleﬁeld Boiler Plant, in
Panther Hollow. ‘ -
Pitt closed Jan. 18 because water
lines used to wash coal at the
Consoladation Coal Plant in Li-
brary, which supplies coal to the
Belleﬁeld‘Plant, werefrozen. , '
‘The Belleﬁeld Plant had_to ask"
Pitt to close down because it wasn’t
sure how long its coal supply would
last, since Consolidation couldn’t

supply the necessary coal, a

Belleﬁeld spokesman said.

The spokesman said the‘ plant
was able to open the next day due to
coal it received from a West Virginia
coal mine. ‘

Although there are no problems
with steamlines when temperatures

Besides maintaining heat and
water lines, another problem
involved with the student resi-
dences is electrical overloads.
“A lot of fuses blow this time of
the year because of overloads,”

Willy Darn, the lower campus chief
electrician said.

“The electrical overloads are
caused by students using portable
heaters along with their other
appliances, all at the same time,”
Dorn said.

“One of our goals is to give career
experience and to educate students
in ' the aspects of the Oakland

community,” student coordinator ‘

Nancy Colgan stated.

“We hope to address the student
to the problems. of the Oakland
community and hope that, in turn,
they’ll be committed to the
program's success.”

Presently, nine student volun-
teers are enrolled in the program
along with two full-time staff
members.

Current group projects include

Parker said Galante also provides 1

a reader service for blind students,
as well as tape recordings of all
Pitt ’_s bulletins and catalogs, testing
services, library assistance and text

working at both day care centers in
Oakland and the Mathilda Theiff
House, where program participants
work with girls ages 12 to 14.

In addition to planning com-
munity lunches, the group mem-
bers are also making plans for the
Community Awareness Seminar to
be held March 14-15 at the Student
Union.

The seminar will be held in
conjunction with other interested
University clubs and activities.

Students interested in joining the
program are urged to contact

The rriost immediate issue facing the newly elected Student
Government Board will be an attempt by the administration to raise

" The administration is probably certain this attempt will be successful,
judging from its past record. Which is all the more reason the new
Board’s opposition must involve a lot of hard work and an activist stand.

When candidates, many of the victors promised to reactivate the
state-related schools’ student lobby to pressure Harrisburg legislators
into giving Pitt enough money, consequently avoiding a tuition hike.

They can start their terms by continuing Pitt’s involvement in the ,
creation of a new charter for the lobby. The Board must also rally Energy _ us

tably encounter in college level
courses. Such action is merited as a
short-run contingency to deal with
the actual student body attending

" CAS, but a long run strategy must
also be envisioned that will not only
deal with, but attempt to eliminate
existing problems.

In speciﬁc, no goals have been
determined that would adequately
I V‘ deal with the lack of admissions
I standards. An admissions quota is
a far cry from true admissions
standards. Beside the academic
necessity for these standards, only
‘when they are adopted will we be
able to deal head-on with the ethical
question of admitting minority
students and athletes whose
academic qualiﬁcations are well
below those of the average member

3 of the freshman class.

Special support programs have
been established to keep these
students from failing. An honest
assessment of the situation will
reveal that these programs should

‘not even be necessary (despite the

fact that they are) because no
students should be admitted or
retained who cannot deal with
college level work. With or without
support programs, these students
are being exploited for their tuition
dollars, as are other students whose
successful completion of 120 credits
results in the same credentials
given students who’ marginally
squeak through.

It would be ideal to retain the
present structure of CAS while
setting up minimum standards of
admission and allowing the chips to
fall where they may. The realities of
budget would cause a rude
awakening, however, if only 1,000
students would be accepted and
matriculate, leaving a budget
deﬁcit of nearly $1 million. A more
exte_nsive long-run solution —is
mandated.

Dean Marshall’s suggestion of a
smaller and more selective CAS
with an expanded daytime School of
General Studies deserves careful

    Plan Standards, Goals Now

consideration as the one plan
proposed thus far which could
forseeably eliminate existing prob-
lems in CAS. Because most present
SGS courses are taught by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS),
careful balancing of such a program
could result in a resolution to
existing academic problems, with
an enhancement of educational
opportunities and a balanced
budget.

To cope with a problem is .not
enough. Where a solution is in
sight, it should be explored and

pursued. The speed and extent to _
which it is pursued depends on the :
way in which it is perceived—is it ;

serious, is it harmful? To answer

these questions, a quote from f
professors Harris, Ogul and Schul- ,
“The view is ;

man should suffice’:
already widespread that Pitt’s

student body is not as good as it '
used to be, and that admission to <
the College is non-competitive.... '
The public is not fully aware of our ’
disarray, but many good students .

know enough not to come here.”

 Letter Supports SGB Action

This letter is in response to an
editorial that appeared in the Pitt
News on Friday, January 28, 1977:

Common sense dictates that a
“old” Student Government Board,-
one which possesses both the

kg, -xperience of the allocation pro-

4 ‘cesses and the knowledge of what
types of individuals have been
successful in donating their efforts
to past Allocation Committees,‘
participate in choosing the new
Allocation Committee.
Now, a few thoughts about
“~ tradition. Tradition,-_accor.ding to
the Student Government Constitu-
‘Q tion, dictates that an ad hoc
committee composed of three

*4

.213

members .of the current Allocation '

Committee and three members of
Qthe Student Government Board
choose the new committee. Only
two members of the Student
Government Board may vote, the
third acts as an ex-officio,

non-voting, member. Thus, clearly
the Allocation Committee domin-
ates the recommendations for the
new committee with 60 percent of
the votes, the Student Government
Board is responsible for the
remaining 40 percent.

Another factor must also be taken
into consideration—time. A new
Student Government Board in an
attempt to fulﬁll its role must spend
a tremendous amount of time
acclimating themselves to policies
and procedures new to them. The
removal ofa tirnecommitment to

select the new Allocation Commit-

tee allows the new Student

Government Board. to spend this ,
additional time more fruitfully. The _

Allocation Committee will also have
a better opportunity to adjust to the
budget process before original
budget hearings begin in the
spring. ’ .

Discrete discrimination

Prof Charges Med School  

A factor contributing to the poor
success rate of our black under-
3 graduate applicants in gaining
admission to the School of Medicine
is easy to identify but much more
difﬁcult to address. 4
Having reviewed the credentials
of hundreds of white applicants to
our Medical School from the
undergraduate campus, I .was
I astounded at the very higli
percentage of those who could point
‘to a hospital experience at such
\ ‘ places as Magee-Womens Hospital,
 Children's Hospital, and Shadyside
Hospital or to a research experience
in the laboratory of a faculty
member at the Health Center of the
University of Pittsburgh. On the
other hand, it is rare to ﬁnd a black
applicant from_Pitt who can point to
such an experience.
The importance of the summer and
vacation experience for pre-med
students in a medical atmosphere
cannot be overemphasized for -it
_ serves many valuable purposes.
K When the time comes for the
I medical school aspirant to complete
the application forms to Pitt, it is
conforting for the white applicant to
know that he or she will have a letter
of recommendation from a well-
5 known. established or inﬂuential
I faculty member or health profes-
sional to support ' his» or her
épplication. '1 ' . -

 

The research laboratory, emer-
gency , room, or physicians-aid
experience also provides the white
applicant with first hand exposure
to the medical profession that the

' applicant can point to and discuss in

the essay component of the
application or to discuss at the time
of the medical school interview.

Does it really make a difference?

You bet it does!" Numerous
qualiﬁed applicants have had their
applications scored negatively on
the grounds that they have had no
contact with the medical profession.

I have witnessed the instance in
the Health Center where a fifteen
year old, white'junior high school
student and child of a prominent
faculty member in the medical
school was able to observe or work

in a bio-medical research labora-
tory, Magee Womens Hospital, and"

the Emergency room" all in one
summer. Why could not a minority
undergraduate from Pitt be provi-_
ded with just one of T these
opportunities. This colleagueship
of the professionals in the Health
Center has been highly successful
in filling the limited number of
summer positions with their own
children or those of their friernds.

No wonder there is no room left for

the black pre-med.‘
allsubmit furthermore that each

. -different experience’ at the_I-Iealth

 

The " ,2

/
fundamental operational frame-
work for the Allocation Committee

‘is to react to, not to initiate, the

budget requests that are brought
before it by student groups. their
ideas and directives should and will
come from_ the new Student
Government Board. Thus this will
allow the new Student Government
Board to effectively direct the new
Allocation Committee. The process
by which the “old” Student
Government Board chose the

— “new,” "Allocations Committee,

which had been ‘written into the
Policy and Procedures guidelines,
allows an additional mechanism for
checks and balances within the
framework of Student Government.

Josh Baylson
Allocations Committee Member

Center usually results in a separate
letter of recommendation in the
applicant’s admission folder, since
the Admissions Committee of the
School of Medicine sets no limit on
the number of supporting letters
.that an applicant may have; it is not
uncommon for the white applicant
to have as many as eight letters of
recommendation. with many of
them signed by faculty members of
the School of Medicine.

The composition, attitudes and
conduct of the Pre-medical Advi-
sory Committee have created an
effective‘ corridor for white appli-
cants to the School of Medicine of
the University of Pittsburgh. Its
lack of concern for the welfare of
minority pre-meds has seriously
limited the opportunities of blacks
on this campus. The poor record of
the’ Pre-medical Committee is
matched only by the shameful state
of affairs in the School of Medicine.
The Health Center of the University
of Pittsburgh is in effect a plantation
where minorities ‘are permitted to
dump our trash, scrub our floors,
and ﬁll our water jugs but where
they must limit their aspirations and
those of their children. ‘

Letters to the Editor

Bozik Didn't Ask

I For Volunteers

While browsing through the
February 2 issue of the Pitt News we
came across a rather curious
statement by a Mr. Ed Bozik
concerning the closing of Hillman
Library over the weekend of
January 28-31. According to Mr.
Bozik, the library was closed
because “We didn’t have any
volunteers to staff the library. ” The
implication was that anyone dis-
turbed by the library’s closing
should blame the mean-spirited and
selfish personnel of the public
desks. The fact is that the decision
to close the library was made
completely independently of the
personal desires of ' the library
employes, prlesumablyby one of the
upper-level administrators. The
reason there were not. any
volunteers is simply because no one
asked for any volunteers. If they
had asked for volunteers, we have
no doubt that there would have been
enough to staff the necessary public
desks. We hope that in the future
both Mr. Bozik and the Pitt News
will check out their facts more
carefully before printing them in the

paper.
Signed by ﬁfteen employes of ‘the

Information Services Department at
Hillman Library. ‘

Bozik Gave Staff

No Closing Option

We, the undersigned,_ staff of
Hillman Library, were surprised to

read the statement attributed to Ed
Bozik, Executive Assistant to the
Chancellor, in the Pitt News of
Wednesday, Feb. 2, 1977.

According to Mr. Bozik the reason
for closing the library while keeping
athletic facilities open “—has to do
with personnel. We didn’t have any
volunteers to staff the library.”
Were classes cancelled because no
professors volunteered to teach?

The truth is, we had no option.

Signed by 19 Hillman Library staff
members.

Homecoming Pick
Called Unfair

‘ Many times last semester as well
as this semester .we have seen
advertised in the Pitt News that
people were needed to ﬁll positions
on next year’s Homecoming
Committee. Since we are in our
sophomore year, we decided that

’ we wanted to become involved in

activities other than academic.
We have always been interested

in homecoming, but never really felt .

a part since we are neither greeks or
residents. These are the only two
groups which seems to participate
in Homecoming. We felt that by
joining this committee, we could
ﬁnally be “involved.” When we
went to sign up, however, we found
that we would have to be
interviewed before being able to
participate.

Each of us were assigned to
various times in which to have our
interviews. When we got there,
three people ﬁred various questions
such as “What do you as an

individual have to offer?” or “If you
could be on another committee,
which one would you pick?” It

these have no correct or set
answers. All three of use were
informed that same evening that we
had not been “selected” for the
committee.

It is unfair to be selected for a
committee on the basis of a
ﬁve-minute interview. In fact, it is
unfair to have to be selected at all.
Why can’t a person just sign up and
work on the committee that they
chose? A

We realize that a great number
signed up for the Homecoming
Committee (65 to be exact), but why
not put all on the committee? Since
there are so many differentduties

involved in a committee such as .

Homecoming, - sub-committees
couldvbe formed where all 65 would
be divided ‘up.

Another alternative would be to
hold four or ﬁve meetings to

determine which students are really‘

interested just be their attendance.
The presentmeans of selection of
a committee act as a restraint on
those who want to become involved.
It is unfortunate and unfair that
when students wish toparticipate,
they can’t. . V -

It's all on liberty Ave.

Porno, Burlesques, Smut  

HARRY PARAS

Despite the mayor's efforts to
clean up the city, pornographically
oriented business in the downtown
area, and especially on Liberty
Avenue, is not only doing well, but‘

also ﬂourishing.

On Liberty alone, there are at
least a dozen pornographic places,
and around two dozen are located in
the entire downtown area. Most of
them stay open 24 hours a day (“We
Doze But Never Close”), seven
days a week. Why? Because they
are doing a big business, as a stroll
down Liberty Ave. will verify.

The most recent addition to the
street is the “burlesk” theaters. At
one end of Liberty, there is the
Penthouse Theatre #1 and #2. Here
they have live males performing in
one theater, and females perform-
ing in the other.

It is not traditional burlesque
where the dancers would come out
in a line and kick their legs. Rather,
several performers each come out
individually and dance around to
music while they undress complet-
ely and then dance in the nude. Be-
tween shows, hard-core porno-
graphic ﬁlms are shown. _

At the other end of the street is
the Palace Burlesque Theatre. It
advertises that it has Vegas show
girls, and other big names in the
porno industry, like Honeysuckle
Divine and Georgina Spevlin. In all
essential respects, the Palace is
similar to the other theater.

Right beside the Palace is a place

called Stage 966 where they have

men and women go-go dancers.
Here the performers do not get
completely undressed, but wear a
G-string.

After seeing one of these shows,
if you have the urge, you can visit a
massage parlor. On Liberty, there

are two, the Aardvark Studio (on a '

second story) and the Roman V (on a
third story).

As far as I could tell (see), the
employees are all female.

The massage time-table runs
from fifteen minutes to a half-hour
(although if you’re willing to pay
more, I’m sure time could be
extended). In price, a massage
usually costs anywhere from $20 to
$50, depending on services.

A ﬁfteen-minute massage, girl
not topless, costs $20. Other
services, increasing in price, are a
massage, girl topless; girl nude;
two girls topless; two girls nude;
and a $50 “Deluxe’_’ massage(?).
The policies; vary somewhat from
parlor to parlor. On the ﬂoors below
the parlors are adult movies, books
and magazines.

Hidden on a little backstreet of
town is an inconspicuous-looking‘
massage parlor called the Taurean
Model. From the external
appearances, it might be mistaken
for a nice, quaint restaurant.

_ Basically, it offers the same services

as the others.

The next group of pornographic
purveyors on Liberty has no real
name, but from its servicesican be
called “Peep Shows (25 cents),
Books. Adult Magazines, and Other
Various Parapliernelia.” These

The World's a Big Zoo

places are easily spotted, as they
usually have a white sign with
“Adult Movies 25 cents” in big red
ﬂashing letters. By name, they are
the Deluxe Arcade (two of these),
the Adult Fun House, the Emerald

Theatre and several “Adult Movies '

25 cents.”

For twenty-ﬁve cents, you can sit
in’ a black cubicle (ironically
enough, reminiscent of a confes-
sional box) and watch about
forty-five ‘seconds of the flick of your
choice. The doors are numbered,
and on a sort of bulletin board the
number is matched with the movie.

For instance, if you want to view
the movie in booth 21, you look on
the bulletin board for number 21,
where you will ﬁnd the title, several
preview pictures, and a written
description of the “plot.” To see
the whole thing costs a buck (four
minutes, maybe).

-Porno magazines abound in these
places. In these magazines‘ are
depictedevery normal and abnor-
mal sexual act imaginable (and
probably possible, too). These
magazines make newstand porno
(Playboy, Penthouse) look like
Mickey Mouse.

In price, hard-core pornography
ranges from $4 to $10 for one
magazine, some costing, at lowest,
$3, and others up to $15 and $20.

The porno books are sheer sex
from the first page to the last
(barring introductory hellos), and
written in the style of perhaps an
ambitious fourth-grader.

Occa-

   
   
  

sionally, there is a pictorial section
in the middleof the book (I suppose
for those whose imaginations are
underdeveloped).

A big new item in these places are
“Honey Buns and Honey Cups” -
100 percent edible panties and bras.

“Doc Johnson” also has out a line
of “ﬂavored love lubricants,”
cherry seeming to be the most
abundant flavor.

Vibrators of numerous shapes,
sizes and textures abound. Lining
the shelves are plastic body parts
and inﬂatable males and females.
Behind the counters are 8mm films
and packets‘ of color snapshot
photos. Also, they have a line of

Lastly, on Liberty Avenue, two
movie theaters, the Liberty Theatre
and the Art Cinema, run full-length
feature pornographic movies such
as “Deep Throat” and “The Devil

in Miss Jones.” These cost $3.50, ‘ —.

sometimes $5.00, depending on the
popularity of the movie. '

One might wonder why Liberty
Avenue exists, and continues to
thrive, despite protest fromvarious
quarters?

The simple truth is that people
patronize these places. In short, a
substantial enough number of

people do want them

Spectacular Success

A Slavery Snowjob?

BY JIM FARERI

ABC’s “Roots” was one of the
most successful programs in the
history of television. It didn’t
succeed via old formulas. It broke
rules, and perhaps set precedents.

The show ran for 12 hours divided
among eight straight nights: this is
a revolutionary jump towards
more-active programming, as op-
posed to the tradition of stretching
out a series by running one episode
a week for several weeks.

“Roots” demanded considera-
tions of the viewer never made
before—eight consecutive nights of
time and, consequently, a good deal
of consciousness yielded up to the
program. People went from day to
day thinking “Roots.”

. Although the show is not the ﬁrst,
it is the best adaptation of writing
not originally done for television-
ooming from Alex Haley's best-
selling book.

The subject matter of “Roots”
also rejected tradition. It was not
lost in a limbo of irrelevance or
calculated to appeal only to the
TV-prone masses. It said things to
people, got them excited and gave
their brains something to masticate.

Aside from the innovations, what
did “Roots” mean to millions who
saw it? One thing seems certain:
what “Roots” is depends upon your
prespective.

Literally, “Roots” was about
several generations of a black
family experiencing slavery in
America, from the capture of the
patriarch Kunta Kinte before the
American revolution, until the
ﬂeeing of his ancestors after the
Civil War.

The emphasis of the show was on
the individual and the family—but
the struggle of Alex Haley's
ancestors must be extended to the
struggle of the black race in
general. This was a serious
problem for “Roots.” Many
viewers saw this larger struggle to.
be of greater importance than the

lone illustrated.

Some blacks I spoke with
complained that too many “impor-
tant facts were left out. For
instance, we were not told of the.
organized resistance Africans put
up against the slave traders, or that
the entire west coast of Africa was
nearly depopulated. The historical
focus was too narrow to satisfy
social consciousness, and this can
be offensive; especially with ours
awareness of racism today.

Another problem pointed to was
the “losing context” into which the
blacks were put. The socialvictories
they ’scored, if any, were far
out-weighed by the amount of
whipping they received and the
number of times the slavers
assaulted black women. And when

 

the family ﬁnally “escapes” there

is bitter irony, for we know well‘

what lies ahead for them in the
decades to come.

Probably most disturbingwas the
possible implications of “Roots”
concerning the obliteration of
oppression for blacks. The
“fairy-taleish” ending not only
was, to some, weak structurally, but
also seemed to suggest that the
trouble for blacks was over.

Oddly enough, I’ve heard,

opinions going both ways,

' Presumably, the show was biased to

either the white or black race. This
illustrates an unfounded ambiguity
that the show wore as a badge, but
to others was a scar. Even though it
may sound far-out tothe average TV

.programmer, people actually do

have opinions and enjoy expressing
them—that’s good, even if a show
like “Roots” unearths our hidden
prejudicies.

Those who enjoyed the program

Two Sixties Voices Still Sound Good

BY TOM WASELESKIV ”

33%, George Harrison.
Dark Horse Records, DH-3005.

He noticed he was thirty-three
years and four months old when he
began cutting the album and sohe
named it for the point in his time
that it came about. In a way, it’s
a ﬁtting and ongoing celebratory
record of one man's musical
contribution.

Forget all those Harrison albums
reviewed with optimism yet listened
to with the grimmest of disappoint-
ment. Forget those worthless
tracks of “Maya Love,” “Far East
Man,” and “Be Here Now.” The
boy’ ﬁnally turned loose a monster.

Dipping further into soul and sax,
Harrison has ﬁnally put together a
driving, excitingly fresh record to
remind us that here is not just
another guitar picker who goes into
the studio once a year to cut an
album.

The single “This Song” is a clue
in itself that Harrison has renewed
our stake in him as a great
performer and writer. Unlike his
sourly bitter “Sue Me Sue You
Blues” and “Back Off Boogaloo,”
Harrison airs his latest gripe with
style and wit in “This Song.” The
ridiculous lawsuit in which he was
pronounced guilty of stealing the
melody from “He’s So Fine”- and
turning it into “My Sweet Lord" is
the focus of attack here.

“Dear One” is a dangling, airy

 

 

song, beautiful almost in spite of
itself. A lot of thick acoustic strum
here, as Harrison carries a strong
voice through from start to ﬁnish.

He hardly uses his falsetto,
something that's encumbered him
tremendously since he left his
original band, on “33 ‘/3." There is
power in his straight voice, as
shown in “This Song” and “See
Yourself."

“It’s What You Value” is also
strong vocally, and could make a
tough followup to ‘ ‘This Song.’ ’ In a

lot of ways it's like “What Is Life”
from “All Things Must Pass,” still
far and away his best album. It
pounds, it churns, Harrison belts at
times and there’s a solid guitar line.

“Crackerbox Palace” and “Wo-
man Don't You Cry for Me” are the
only booby prizes in this collection,
which is a twist—usually the ratio is
the other way around.-

Even Cole Porter's “True Love”
is handled with a certain ability
unlike “Bye Bye Love’_’ from “Dark 1
Horse.” _ ‘ »

    

 

Maybe Harrison wasn't done and
out after all. Maybe it really was the
hepatitis and the lawsuits and the
hellish tour and the nearly

destroyed voice. ‘ ‘33‘/3 ” is the best
proof of this to come along.

 
 
  
 
 
  
 

BY TOM WASELESKI
Gulf Winds, Joan Baez.
A&M Records, SP-4603.

Joan Baez is one of a rare breed
musicians who can survive a decade

‘I of the recording business, and sing

to tell about it.

Despite an occasional venture
into the commercial world of the hit
single (“The Night They Rolled Ol’
Dixie Down‘ ’), she clings to her folk
roots on albums, and though glitter,
space rock and disco fads may come
and go, no such bandwagon will ﬁnd‘
her a rider.

Her style remains essentially
unaltered after a decade of fame,

5 and “Gulf Winds”. "continues on the

same course. While she's been

written up recently in rock tabloids

 

as turning into a horrible material-
ist, her music sings, untainted b.y
grand dreams of proﬁt and prestige.

The band is largely unknown,
except for Jim Gordon on drums and
Larry Knechtel on piano, neither of

_whom dominate the other players.

If any of the playing can be called
dazzling, it’-s Baez’s own acoustic
strum. Take “O Brother!,”
probably the catchiest tune on the
record. The bristling choruses

"make the song and Baez’s ﬂeeting
‘ﬁngers make the choruses in some

hard folk, soft rock guitar pickin’.

But as anyone even remotely
familiar with Joan Baez knows, the
willowy, early ’60s style folk vocals
are the forefront of her songs. It’s
perhaps this holdover-from-a-
bygone-era sound that keeps Baez a
mere undercurrent in today’s music
and not a contending force.

She comes through beautifully on
“Sweeter for Me, ’ ’ the LP’s opener.
With a violin and double piano
backup, the love song is nothing
short of moving, Baez’s intonations
giving the words emotional power.
‘ ‘You suffered sweeter for me, ” she
bleats, “than anyone I've ever
known,” over and over in the
chorus.

“Seabirds” and “Caruso” have a
Latin ﬂair to them, and though well
arranged with synthetic effects and
acoustics, are not as successful. The
former shows an overuse of the
Baez falsetto and the latter features
an ever-present set of castanets that

can grate on one’s nerves by the
third verse e ‘- . - ‘

 

 

were not bothered by these
considerations. They were willing
to accept the emphasis where it was
placed—on the individual human in
a situation that all people could
identify with. The struggles of
Kunta Kinte and Chicken George
were absorbed by the viewer as his
struggles too. For these people,. a
universal appeal deﬁed_ all other
boundaries.
wholesale distribution of a people’s
oppression, their struggles and
even their identities to others not
evolving from the same history, is
not just.

But, as some critics would tell us,
we must judge the work on its ability
to meet its goals. In spite of the
complications, perhaps unforeseen,
“Roots” succeeded in showing us
the triumph of an American family,
if only in limited terms. My
strongest suggestion would have
been to let the story continue into

the present and address today’s I‘

parallel circumstances in today’s
more certain terms.

Another pair of tunes gives a
good comparison of her ,_.vocal
success onithe upper and lower
ranges. “Still Waters at Night” is a
slow, almost painfully high croon-
-ing. What makes it worse is that she
backs herself in the same high,
whining. pitch.

‘ ‘Kingdom of Childhood, ” on the
other hand, is also double-tracked,
but it’s sung straightforward in
Baez’s most comfortable range.
The easy, pacing beat ﬁnds good
company in a voice that doesn’t
teeter on the upper rungs of the
scale.

The title cut, a sort of
10-and-a-half-minute folk epic, has
a starkly naked quality to it that is

‘ not worth such a thick slice of plastic

(or an album title). With vocal and
acoustic guitar, the song labors on,
verse after verse, in a musical
monotone reminiscent. of the
coffee-house folk in this country a
decade ago.

While Baez’s voice deserves at
least as much play as Joni
Mitchell's, she can never hope to
get it by singing musical test
patterns that are 10 years old.. '

For others, the -

ﬁrst of President Carter’s exciting, down-home ﬁreside chats on the
tube.

Whatever it was, the Panthers needed every ounce of it. Despite
opening the game with a tough defense, Pitt displayed the rash of
sloppiness that has plagued them all season. And just when it seemed
they were closing in on the Bearcats, the Panthers found some way to

blow it—a bad pass, a traveling violation or slippery ﬁngers. Amazingly, _

with the crowd behind them, the Panthers pulled to within a two-point
deficit, 34-32, when Michael Rice hit a jumper at the first-half buzzer..
Starting the second half, Pitt had the momentum, outscoring the

Bearcats in the early going—only to fall silent themselves and turn a ‘-

Panthers never led; that is, until Larry Harris’ 22-foot jumper cracked‘ 1

revived one of the most staggering
of grid programs in the country and
led it to the glory of a national
championship, greeting people
throughout the crowd and stopping
to shake hands with his successor

Sherrill. _

Majors inspected the MacArthur
Bowl, which is a 10-inch high model
of a football stadium, complete with
miniature goal posts and etched
yard lines, with a proud satisfac-

the feat he had come to" Pittsburgh
to do. ‘

by two other coveted awards
captured by Pitt—the Sugar Bowl
trophy and Tony Dorsett’s prize, the
Heisman Trophy.

As the jazz-rock ensemble “Solid

emcee Bill Hillgrove of WTAE
began the festivities by introducing

Pittsburgh Pirate owner and
chairman of the board of the
National Football Foundation John
W. Galbreath presented the 19th
annual MacArthur Bowl, named in
memory of the late General Douglas

Wesley W. Posvar, saying, “The

Pantherettes Nosed Out

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

In Edinboro, Lady Scots are not
double-ply tissues-at least on the
basketball courts—and after their
71-66 trouncing of the Pitt
Pantherettes Wednesday night, it’s
easy to conclude that Scots are
nothing to sneeze at.

The early going was very close,
with Edinboro sinking a couple of
quick buckets in the final seconds of
the first half to pull ahead at the
break. Behind the super shooting of
center Sheila Collins, Edinboro put
the game out of Pitt's reach in the
third quarter. What really spelled
defeat for the Pantherettes were
their turnovers, which surprisingly
'_'_were not that numerous. '
‘points in what Wallace termed “one
of her better games.” Forward
Barb Welsh and freshman guard

Kathy Paczkowski also scored in the.

“We had 20 turnovers to their
17,” said Pitt coach Pat Wallace.
“Again, the difference is that they
capitalized on our turnovers.” ‘

Center Wanda Randolph led the

'- Pantherettes in" scoring with 21

double-figure bracket with 14 and
10 points, respectively.

“Barb is really coming around
well, and has been playing much
better defensively,” Wallace noted.
However, Welsh, ranked second in
the East in foul shooting with a nifty
91 per cent efficiency, suffered a
knee injury against the Scots and
may miss a few games.

The loss to Edinboro interrupted‘,
a four-game win streak for the 11-4
Pantherettes. Last weekend, -Pitt
took two road victories—an 89-65
thrashing of tough Federal City and
a 73-48 massacre of Towson.

The long-awaited confrontation
between Randolph and Federal City
center Sheila “Too Tall" Patterson
didn’t take place-——Wallace said the
Federal team is plagued with
internal problems and Patterson
watched the game from the
bench—but Patterson’s replace-
ment, Sheila Williams, proved to be
more than adequate. A

Although Federal City never led
throughout the game, there were a
few scary moments: Pitt blew a

20-point lead‘ and Williams (the
game’s leading scorer with 23
points) narrowed the gap to a single
point by halftime.

The Pantherettes put the game
away in the second half, but Federal

A “It looked to me like they were

Randolph and Mimi Senkowski

Pitt while Paczkowski and Welsh

Towson provided a nice breather
for the Pitt squad, a bit
anti-climactic after Federal City.

‘‘It was a well-rounded effort,”
said Wallace. ‘ ’

Randolph tallied 22 points, Welsh
added 14, Senkowski had 12 and

Paczkowski scored 10.

Posvar then read a message of

congratulations from Governor
Milton Shapp and quipped, “When
I go to my budget hearing with the
state next month, I’m going to take
this with me.”

The national championship was
Pitt’s ninth, placing the Panthers
fifth on the all-time list, but was the
school's first since 1937. “The next
one will come much sooner,”
Posvar promised. “Very soon
_ indeed."

The initial winner of the
MacArthur Bowl was Syracuse, but
this is the first since then an eastern
team has been able to regain the
trophy.

“We are proud of the fact we
focused the eyes of the country" on
the eastern ‘part of the country
where the sport began,” commen-
ted Athletic Director Casimir
Myslinski, who then presented one
of the team’s captains, Jim Corbett,

and Majors.

“I just noticed some writing on
here,” Corbett said. “It says,
‘There’s no substitute for victory,’
and that's what we did—we went
from 1-10 to 12-0.” Corbett also
expressed appreciation to the fans
of the Pittsburgh area.

Majors, who will be in town
through Sunday and the presenta-
tion of the Dapper Dan award to
Dorsett, spoke brieﬂy and offered
his best wishes to Sherrill.

“I’m proud to be a part of this,”
Majors said. “It’s amazing ‘what
you’ve done.” In his usual way,
Majors took little of the credit due
for himself.

There was a feeling of continued
optimism in the air as the program
came to an end, with Posvar putting
a lot of words into one neat capsule
summary.

“I would like Jackie Sherrill to
look these things (the trophies) over
very carefully and measure them,”
Posvar joked.

  Grapplers Seas-ed By
Eagle Untlertow, 32-I3,

BY JIM LEWIS A

By. the time the Pitt wrestling
team patched.the leak, the boat had
sunk. . .

Down 29-0'after the first six
bouts, the Panthers manned the
lifeboats and rowed away from a
titanic 32-13 loss to the 16th-ranked
Clarion Golden Eagles (12-3).

“We wrestled very poorly,”
Coach Dave Adams complained. “I-

Adarns had to go,down-with his

After Clark, Brian Jacobs (126),

and Kevin McNamara (150) were
pinned, and Steve Carter (134), Kim
Smith (142) and Jim Gordon (158)
were plummeted, the heavyweight
crew was called upon to keephopes
afloat. But despite the impressive-
boatmanship of Skip Bolin (Pinned
Eagle John Barnett in 4:05 at 167

match to powerful Jay Hockenbrock
at 177), Bill Bailey (decisioned Gary

was too deep to surface from. Pitt’s

Millersville and a .41-3 disaster at

baffled as to why the Panthers’ sails
‘haven’t been blooming.
“I don’t know'if We’re feeling

said.’ “I’m sick of saying we have

Gymnasts: All Not

BYMARKMURPHY

If you are one of the folks who still
think all losing coaches should be
angry over their team’s defeat, you
probably have not spoken to men’s
gymnastic coach Frank D’Amico. If
the first-year coach was smarting
over his club's 202.1-179.85 loss to
national champion Penn State
Wednesday night at University
Park, he had enough ﬁne perfor-
mances, good efforts and consistent
scoring to take away some of the
sting.

“We had some good performan-
ces by different people,” D’Amico
said. “We did a good job for the
ﬁrst two events, better than we
expected. It was in the last four
events that we did not do as well.

“But the best thing that Pitt has
showed is its consistency," he
continued. “Our scores for the last
four meets have all been around 180
points. We have been getting
consistency and you can go up from
there.”

Although the Panthers did not
capture a single individual title
(“Penn State had a monster in every
event,” D’Amico explained), some
performers sparkled in defeat. In
the ﬂoor exercises, Pitt’s Tom Biers
whetted D’Amico’s appetite for
future wins by getting a 9.0.

“Tom added a move to his routine
during warmups,” D’Amico said.
“In the meet he performed it
beautifully. He's shown he is a 9.0
performer. I’m looking forward to
taking him to the Eastem’s.”

Senior Rob Pasterick took third

' place in the all-around competition

with a scorelof 47.75. In ﬁnishing
well behind two Penn State
gymnasts, Pasterick captured third
place in the high bar and fourth in

both the parallel bars and rings.

“Pasterick has shoulder prob-
lems but he still does a hard routine,
especially on the rings,” D’Amico
praised. “I was pleased with his
performance. ’ ’

Senior Don Stevenson also
provided D’Amico with some happy
moments, taking second place in
the side horse and anotf ler second in
the vaulting with a sec re of 9.15.

But all of the Pa 1ther’s ﬁne
efforts could not ov zrcome the
Nittany Lions’ edge in sheer talent.
Penn State is the defending national
champion and its roster boasts two
Olympians and another pair who
made it to the ﬁnals in the Olympic

lost Thumbs Down

BY MARK MURPHY

When the Pitt women’s gymnas-
tic team placed Penn State on its
schedule, local gymnastics fans
must have seen it as something akin
to young Christians making dates
ﬁghting Lions—in this case the
Nittany Lions, only the number-two
ranked team in the country.

Well, the ladies left University
Park Wednesday night far from
eaten up. They came back to Pitt
heads held high and, according to
Coach Donna DeMarino, pleased
with their effort, despite a 129.35-
118.90 loss to their powerful rivals.

“We were thrilled we came
within 10 points of them,” the
ever-cheerful DeMarino said.
“They have a more established
program than we do. It was not a
landslide victory for them.”

Part of the reason for Pitt’s
success was the performance of

trials. To top it off, the Penn State
coach, Gene Wettstone, is some-
times called “Mr. Gymnastics.”

“I am happy we held our own,”
D’Amico stated. “We are a
180-point team. Maybe we can
improve and place well in the
Eastem’s. If we get a fourth or ﬁfth
I'll be happy.”

The next opponent for the 2-2
Panthers is Slippery Rock, a
traditional gymnastic rival.

“They have beaten us in past
years but we will beat them this
year,” a conﬁdent D’Amico opined.
“They have not scored above 170 all
year so we can beat them and I want
to beat them!”

Regina Carson, who finished fourth
in the all-around competition with a
score of 31.05, just .15 points away
from a second-place ﬁnish. The
freshman from Belle Vernon took
second in the floor exercises with an
8.25 and third on the balance beam
with a 7.60. According to
DeMarino, Carson’s scores, along
with everyone else’s, were on the
low side.

“The scoring was low,” the
third-year coach said. “Both teams
scored about 15 points.less than
usual. Regina scored 8.9 on the
floor exercises last week and did an
equally good routine last night
(Wednesday), but got an 8.2. Penn
State had been scoring about 140.
and we’ve been scoring about 125.

“The judges started out scoring»
low in vaulting (the ﬁrst event) and
to keep everything relative for the
rest of the evening they kept the
scores low. I personally feel every

short while. He needed time to

around practice sessions and ofﬁce
work.

So Grgurich spent three days in
exile, presumably trying to rid
himself of a collar of pressure with

which he had outﬁtted himself. “I -

felt that to take the pressure off the
guys on the team, I had to take it
myself, so that's what I did.”

score, whether it was Pitt or Penn
State, should have risen by about
ﬁve-tenths.”

Other highlights of the meet for
Pitt were Cyndee Severyn’s 7.8 on
the uneven parallel bars and Clare
Henry’s 7.1 in the same event.

“Our unevens are our weakest
events,” DeMarino explained.
“But now it is starting to get better
for us.”

Jan Anthony, a freshman from
Philadelphia, led Penn State to its
victory by taking the all-around title
with a total score of 34.40. Some
other "names on the Penn State
roster read like a “who’s who” in
women’s gymnastics. One woman
competing for Penn State was Ann
Carr, multi-gold medalist in the
Pan-American Games. Carr, luckily
for Pitt, could not take part in the
meet due to a muscle pull. The
Lions also feature Karen Schuck-
man, a former national college
all-around champion.

but Harris’ Cincy-crushing shot was
what loosened that collar.

“That shot can’t make up for all
of what’s happened this year, but it

. takes care of most of it,” Harris

said. “Did I know it was going to go
in? I knew it would fall as soon as
Coach Grgurich called the play.”4

The play was “double Larry.”
Larry runs down the left sideline
and circles under the basket, while
two teammates try to obliterate
whoever is watching the tangy 6‘-6
junior.

“I almost slipped getting to the
corner,” Harris said. “But Ed
(Scheuermann) and someone else
did a good job on the double-pick.
Eddie really got his man, so the man
watching me was late.”

Not too late to put a ﬂashing hand

_in Harris’ face, but that merely
added to the scene. And, to his
performance.

‘ ‘He played the kind of game that

lets him see what we're trying to ‘

inspire him to do," Grgurich said.
“He dominated the game, and
that’ s the kind of character we'd like
to see him assumeonthis team.”

It‘ was Harris who stole the ball,
rebounded, scored and hustled
when Pitt was in need. He looked
for the shot when the score was
close.

He led the team.

“This was good for all of us,”

_ Grgurich said last night—he’s back

to his 16-hour days, happily.
“When your team wins, you're a
hell of a coach. When they lose,
you’re lousy.”

With special thanks to Larry
Harris, Tim Grgurich is, at least
until Sunday, a hell of a coach again.
