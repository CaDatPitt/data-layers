University Student Opens
New Israeli Art Gallery

By BERNI McLEOD
After years of interest in
Israeli art, Mrs. Rachel

, Baum, a University under-

graduate, opened “. . .Anoth-
er World” a gallery for dis-
playing outstanding works
of contemporary Israeli artists.
Mrs. Baum visited major,ex-
hibits of Israeli art in America
in order to obtain a wide selec-
tion of art work. From a number

of artists she tried to select those .

works best typifying the newly
developing art of Israel. -

With the exception of Julius
Kahn of Pittsburgh, all of the ar-
tists represented live in Israel. As
immigrants -from such countries
as Poland, Hungary and Ger-
many, they live on Kabbutzim,
socialistic farm communities of
Israel, where they farm and
paint. ‘

“These people have not devel-
oped a typical Israeli art,” said
Mrs. Baum. “Since most artists
are mainly preoccupied with their

-farming, art must take second
 place. Perhaps in ten years

con-
ditions may change.” -

Much of Israeli art, like the.

pictures displayed in “. . . An-

other World,” is heavily inﬂu-

enced by European styles and

The University’s J o h n s t o w n

' land which ‘more than triples the

"size of its “-new Richland Town-

town’s President Dr. Theodore

The acquisition of the 316 acres

Dr. Herbert Aptheker, na-
tional director of the Ameri-
can Institute, for Marxist.
Studies, has been invited by
the Universitys’ Students

for Peace to speak Wednes-
day at noon in the Student Union
Ballroom. Dr. Aptheker, who was
one of three Americans who vis-
ited North Vietnam on an unoffi-
cial fact-ﬁnding mission last De-
cember, will speak on his experi-
ences in Hanoi.

Dr. Aptheker was accompanied
on his trip to North Vietnam by
Staughton Lynd, professor of his-
tory at Yale University, and.
Thomas Hayden, a national vice-
president of the Students for a
Democratic Society.

On their return, the three re-
ported that, contrary to state-
ments _by the Johnson adminis-
tration, the Hanoi government ‘of
Ho Chi Minh had not been ap-
proached with proposals for end-
ing the war in Vietnam at any

“peace offensive.” Dr. Aptheker
has also written a book, Mission

to Vietnam, which will be pub-
lished in the near future. He is

Community College
To Enter Competition

By DAN -BOOKER ,

- Theﬂcompetition among area colleges for local high
school talent has been illuminated by the recent controversy
over the University’s state relatedness. This competition
will be increased even more ‘when Allegheny County opens
the first two branches of its_ community college in Septem-
ber. A ’ ’ .- V ‘

_ Students in thenew college will enter either a two-year
transfer program or -a two-year terminal course in some

special skill. The transfer student will take liberal arts and
science courses to prepare them to enter accredited four-year colleges
as juniors. They will pay a $300 tuition fee, lower than any other
area college. « '

‘A ten-acre site near Monument Hill on Pittsburgh’s North Side
has been acquired by the community college’s board of trustees as.
the ﬁrst permanent setting for a branch of the college. Eventually,
the college will have six branches, two in the city and four spread
out’ over the rest of the county.  ' '

The trustees have also chosen temporary quarters for a second
branch of the college. These quarters include Gateway Area High
School and the. Forbes Trail Technical School.’ These facilities will
only be used at night, however, so the main concentration of stu-
dents will be at the Monument'Hi1l branch. ‘ ’ ~ ‘

Dr. Kermit C. Morissey, president of the community college and
former dean of students at -Brandeis University, will be responsible
for choosing a faculty, from thei600 educators who applied for fac‘-A
ulty positions before the estimated 1,000 students begin classes in
the fall. ’ ' T
, Agitation for a community college in Allegheny County which could
rival those of California and New York began in 1963. Several plans
were submitted to the state for consideration but were rejected for
various reasons. In May, 1965, the voters of Allegheny County ap-
proved a plan whereby one-third of the cost of-‘the college would
be paid by‘-thelstate, one-third by thecounty, and one-third by tui-
tion.ch_arges._    ’ » - ' . 5"

stract paintings of Joseph Zarit-

no justiﬁcation; it need not be
naturalistic or especially pleas-
ing to an audience.

Among the collection are paint-
ings by Moshe Bernstein depict-
ing Jewish folk legends. Hung in
one corner of the gallery are
also stone mozaics, symbolizing
the various tribes of Israel.

Of special interest to Mrs.
Baum is the work of Jenny Mai-
seles, an immigrant to Israel
from Russia. In a series of pencil
sketches she has drawn named
the Hassidim, mystic Orthodox
Jews. Because they will not per-
mit themselves to be photograph-

Playboy Opinion Survey

(-The ‘ following is a recent opinion survey by
' "Playboy Magazine.) 
_. ‘ A majority of United States college stu-

fit is justiﬁable as a means to an end. Fur-
-ther, 79 per cent are opposed to the busing
of Negro children to schools out of their

tain school integration; and an overwhelm-

oreover, 66.7 per cent of the students be-

The Playboy College Opinion Survey,

In recent months the Students for Peace has been struggling for

acceptance within the University community. Last term they narrowly es-
caped having their official recognition challenged. At that time many

     

   

 

groups including The Pitt News defended their right to be an integral part

of the University activities.
In the past campus political groups have restricted their invitations
to speakers who are sympathetic to their political 'views. The Young,
Democrats have brought--in candidates endorsed by their party and the
Young Republicans have done likewise.

With such a campus tradition

behind them, the Students for Peace leave themselves open to much criti-

that qualiﬁed Negro job'applicants should
not be given preference over qualiﬁed ap-
plicants of other races as a means of speed-
ing up equality. As to busing of Negro
school children, 60.6 per cent said they were
opposed and 75.9 per cent disagreed that
the ultimate solution to the “racial prob-
lem” is- intermarriage. V

DIFFERE.NTIATING from the students,
53.9 per cent of the faculty do not believe
that the diversity of civil rights organiza-
tions is more of a hindrance than a help to
the civil rights movement as a whole and
75.4 per cent said they thought that the
Negro civil rights leadership has, by and
large, acted wisely and responsibly in try-
ing to achieve racial equality. . . 5

The Playboy College Opinion Survey al-
so reflects opinions from campuses on a re-
gional basis#i'n the East, Midwest, South,
Southwest and West. Analysis of the re-
turns show that in the South, the students
tend to be more “conservative,” while in
the Southwest, the faculty-took the “con-
servative” point of view. The most “liberal”

stand among students was taken in the
Midwest, and among the faculty, in the
East.

Only 34.8 per cent of the South students
thought that the Negro civil rights leader-
ship acted wisely ‘and responsibly in trying
to achieve racial equality, and 61.5 per cent
of the Southwestern faculty thought that
it has. This percentage, while higher than
that of the Southern students, was still the
lowest percentage return among all the re-
gional faculties on this question. Also of
interest is that none of the Southwestern
faculty thought that qualiﬁed Negro appli-

. cants should be given preference over ap-
_ plicants of other races, while ﬁve per cent

of the Southern students agreed that they
should. '

In analyzing the regional returns, it is
also interesting to note that only 10.7 per
cent of the faculty on Western campuses
(scene of a number of demonstrations dur-
ing recent years) thought that civil dis-
obedience to the extent of blocking traffic
is justiﬁable as a means to an end. This is
the lowest return on this question among

I have always refused to

and comparative standards

of living, or to busy them-’

have proved themselves or
how “scientiﬁcally”

Rain Hinders Baseball Team

Lefthander Dave Welty
pitches today in the resched-
Euled West Virginia game, as’
_’c_oach Bobby Lewis attempts to
regroup his baseball forces after
losing, 8-1, at Hiram last Tuesday.

Mountaineer coach Steve Har-
rick can counter with any one
of ﬁve top pitchers who have a
cumulative earned run average
or 1141 through 14 games.Vaughn
Kovach, a righthander, leads the
team with a 0.19 earned run aver-
age and a 4-1 record.

Harrick’s pitching ‘staff has lim-

ited the opposition to a .188 bat-
ting average, but at the same
time the Mountaineers have hit
the ball at a .294 average. Catch-
er Chuck Boggs leads the team,
hitting .471, followed by second
baseman Walt Listuon at .412.
* In the Mountain State last sea-
son, the Panthers won 5-2 but
lost at home by the same score.
Last year, however, the baseball
teamhad won ten games at this
time. This year rain has forced
postponement of four games (in-
cluding WVU and Indiana. State
last week) and not playing reg-
ularly has hurt. Their record now
is 3-2.

In the loss to Hiram, sound
pitching and a tight defense,
which have characterized Lewis

2 teams over the years, were not
 evident. Hiram accepted two er-
- rors and three walks,
ﬁwith ﬁve hits, and scored seven

coupled

runs in the second inning_ off
pitcher Mark Zovko.

In the ﬁrst loss of the year at
George Washington, the Panthers
-also gave the game away. Win-

Tennis Team
Swimming In
Rainy Season

By MIKE BROURMAN

The University is in the pro-
cess of building new courts for
-the tennis team, but with the
way the weather has been the
past two weeks coach Ben Pope
must be wondering whether it
_might not be a better idea to
build them under water.

So far this year the team has
‘spent more time in the rain than
they have on dry land. The net-
iters have been rained out of all
..but one of their matches, plus
_most of their practice sessions.
_Despite this, junior player Alan
Bauer is optimistic about the
teams chances. ,

“We lack a, really outstanding
Bauer said, “but we

[only match the. team has been
_ able to squeeze .in so far, against
6 Hiram College. Two years ago
‘Hiram shutout the tennis team,
59-0, but this year the netters al-
. most .reversed that, with an easy
5 8-1 win.

  Juniors Bauer and Eric Lieber-
-H-man won singles matches, as did
sophomores Bill Nichols, Jim
‘Ewing, and Bill Goldstein. The
,’ netters swept the doubles match-

es with senior M_arty Liebowitz
and Goldstein, Nichols and Lie-

berman, and sophomores Dick
* Chalfant and Tom Farben work-
V“ ing together.

This week will be a busy one
for the team with matches on
four consecutive ‘days. On Wed-

_-: nesday they play Kent State on
';,Tech’s courts. Then they leave
or three consecutive away match-

_ es‘ with Westminister on Thurs-

ning 8-5, GW combined eight hits
with 14 walks and four errors.

Limited practice, Lewis real-
izes, c0ul_d be the result of the
mitters’ sudden resemblance to
the Salvation Army, but he does
not alibi.

“I’m not discouraged,” Lewis
said, “and neither is the team.
We have had a few errors but
we’ll round out as soon as we
begin to play. regular.”

The weather cancelled what
pitching rotation Lewis had, but
after WVU today he plans to use
Don Stock Thursday at Westmin-
ster, and then come back with

Welty against Duquesne on Fri-
day. The mitters visit Bucknell
Saturday, but the starting pitch-
er is doubtful. '

‘.‘Jim Clister who looks real
good deserves a start,” Lewis
said. “He has been pitching in
relief.”

Clister pitched in an intra-
squad game last week and against
Hiram allowed one hit in two
innings, striking out three.

Against Hiram, second base-
man Steve Eiseman ﬁnally start-
ed to hit, collecting two hits in
four at bats. He was 0-11 before
that.

NIGHT SCHOOL
TECHNICAL STUDENTS

We are in’ touch with a number of
Pittsburgh area employers who frequently
express interest in hiring night school stu-
dents being educated in the technical ﬁeld.
These positions are full-time, and offer
opportunities to acquire experience in the
student’s ﬁeld prior to the time he com.-
pletes his education. Many companies offer
a school tuition aid program.

Metallurgical, Mechanical, Electrical,
Chemical and A Civil Engineering students
are usually in some demand, and openings
often develop for Chemistry majors. A
number of positions exist for Draftsmen
and other men to function as Engineering’
Assistants or Technicians. No . fee of any
sort is charged until the time an applicant
actually receives a job offer and accepts _
it. In the case of men who have already
acquired technical experience and are fairly
well advanced toward their degree, our

service charge can sometimes be negotiated
with the employer.

In the _ event no immediate opening
exists _for a particular individual, his appli-
cation will be kept in our active files, at his
option and ‘without charge, until an appro-
priate job materializes. All applications are,
of course, kept confidential.

Honored
AtBanquet

Despite last year’s horren-
dous record, football is still
the lifeblood of University
sports as evidenced by the
April 4 All ‘Sports Banquet.

At the banquet, which recog-
nized the top athletes of the past,
graduating quarterback Kenny
Lucas was the center of attrac-
tion. .

Nineteen grid records were es-
tablished during the 1965 season.
Five of these were of negative
signiﬁcance, having been set by
opposing teams at the expense of
the inept Panther defense. Eight,
however, placed Lucas’ name in
the record books. .

The Pittsburgh Steeler draft-ee
set the fbllowing records: yards
gained by passing for career (2,-
557); yards gained by passing in
one season (1,921); total passes
“thrown during career (367); to-
tal passes completed during ca-
reer (194); total passes completed
in one season (144); touchdown
passes in one season (10); and
total offense for one season rush-
ing and passing (1,762).

These marks are of added sig-
niﬁcance when considered in
comparison with the support he

received from his teammates. Due ‘

to the porous front line, Lucas
probably set another record, the
most mauled quarterback in Pan-
ther history. Statistics, however,
were not kept on how many times
he was dumped behind the line
of scrimmage.

Past publicity director Beano
Cooke called Lucas, “the guttiest
player I’ve seen in the years I’ve
been connected with sports.”

.At the Awards dinner, Lucas
was presented with the most val-
uable player award for’ football,
the Pitt News award for the out-
standing senior athlete, and the
Charles 0. Hartwig award for
that athlete who through his ef-
forts has contributed the most to
Pitt sports. , ‘

The other most valuable play-
er awards were as follows: bas-
ketball, Larry Szykowny; cross-
country, Dave Eichenlaub; gym-
nastics, Dave McKinnis; soccer,
George Sommer; swimming, John
Lane; Wrestling, Clair Riley;
baseball, Fred Mazurek; golf,
Phil Fassett; tennis, Sam Dona-
telli; and track, Bill Delvecchio.

The Athletic Committee award
was presented to Ferd Sauer ‘and

Luddy Hayden received the East- 

ern Collegiate Athletic Commit-
tee trophy. '

T Associated Collegiate P'res’s
"A unique but perfectly applica-
..._ble« decision was handed down
_,-by Judge William K. Harmon in
%a case involving a former Michi-
[gan State University student
’-"charged with blocking traffic at
a "civil rights sit-in last May.

' Marlene Deutsch was sentenced
:t’o7‘three days in the county jail
_or-— the novel. option of spending
~ he same period of time working
}’on a worthwhile civil rights proj-
" ect in the community.

~ What could be better_than al-
:-lowing the convicted party to ful-
ﬁll‘ the punitive measures by law
by participating in a service proj-
.ect to further a cause similar to
-the one for which she had dem-
onstrated in the ﬁrst place?
 Often, the process by which
persons are punished for break-
_ing the law is criticized for fail-
ing to teach the convicted per-
son anything. Simply being sent
to jail for a. speciﬁed length of
time is not only meaningless but
‘I is sometimes more harmful than
-'-imposing no sentence at all.
Judge Harmon's decision is in-
~’ gdicative of a more progressive at-
titude toward the judicial pro--
cess. _ The option put on Miss
Deutsch clearly put the respon-
sibility on her to choose her own
-punishment. In View of her ap-
_; pagent interest in civil rights, the
I sentence seems singularly just.
-It makes clear that a law was
‘broken and that some price must
be paid for that violation, but it
 does not discredit the cause.

- More decisions like this one
would give more meaning to pun-
shment,.- and would be more con-
«structive to the community than
rmerely sentencing the persons to
incarceration.
