President Carter will decide by Feb. 9 whether or not to

but after enough training I’d probably have the ability to “‘I don’t think women are strong enough to march all day‘
. and then have to ﬁght in the evening,” the woman said, _

“You can’t_treat women equally if they are going to be  ii?‘ 

propose the registration of women as well as men for the
draft, a move seen by political analysts as being a likely
prospect in view of Carter’s pro-Equal Rights Amendment
sentiments.

Many women oppose the idea of registration for either
men or women, but say in theevent of registration, women
should not be exempted.

Susan Flynn, a sophomore in the College of Arts and
Sciences said, “I think it’s the women’s duty; Nowadays.
they have justas many rights to ﬁght for as men do.”

Tammy Clifton, a junior in Pitt’s ROTC program, said
she wasn't very surprised at theprospect of a unisex draft.

“Women wanted equality and that’s what they’ll get,”
she said. '

prospect of women being placed in combat roles.

“I don’t think that women will have to ﬁght in combat, : i‘

_ their ability to f1ght),” she added. ' \,

In 1948, the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act

was adopted by Congress, legally barring women from
combat duty in the Air Force and the Navy and placing
them in secretarial roles. The Army's combat exclusion of
women is a pglieygbut not a statute, in view of the fact that
in 1948 the idea of women in combat was considered
preposterous. L

Airman J acquiline Richey, a_female recruiter for the Air
Force said, “I ‘don’t think reﬂexes or the survival instinct
are sexually oriented.” V ' ‘

Richey thought she was just as’qualiﬁed to fight as men
are.

“I’m a riﬂe marksman which proves that women are
capable of shooting,” she -said. \

However, a Shady-side woman who asked to remain _

ttnidentiﬁed, disagrees with Ri_chey’s views.

men hold’.»”«

Sophomoresusan Flynn said she doesn't think she could “ ' ‘ I ‘I’
survive on the battle ﬁeld “emotionally or physically{’ and

that “many women aren’t capable of killing.”

Many women are concerned that men might be. "i"

distracted by ‘a female on the battle ﬁeld. Airman Richey
said “the male would probably watch the female more than

the enemy. ” -

. And. the woman in Shadyside thought that there migh .

be problems, “perhaps a lot of pregnancies.”
Many men feel that a unisex draft is inevitable. ,.
Secretary of the Army Clifford L. Alexander said on

ABC’s “Issues and Answers” Jan. "27, “I wouldwi

~ 4 Pitt News Staff Writer
The Central Committee for
Conscienlious Objectors (CCCO), a
national, non-profit agency which
counsels Americans faced with

military service. is registering’
individuals opposed to particip-~

ation in the military.
The organization, founded A in

1948, provides individuals with ‘
information on and alternatives to '
military service, according to the -

director of the committee’s Con-
scientious Objection Campaign,
Larry Spears.

Spears said that a person called
for active duty has only 10 days in
which to put together a Conscient-
ious Objector (C0) claim,

“The CCCO is very beneficial in
this case, as it provides a record of

A‘ the individual’s opposition to war

and the military in advance,” he
said. _ .
Registration with the committee

does not guarantee exemption from- -

the draft. However, it could “carry

a lot of weight in convincing a draft »

according to Betty Alexander, a

She brought the problem to her

Americas Willing to Send Troops to Persian Gulf « 

Persian Gulf will be regarded as an
assault on the vital‘ interests‘ of the
United States of America and such
an assault will be repelled by any
\means necessary, including mili-
tary force.” * .
In fact, the pool found American
almost as willing to use U.S.
military power to defend the

‘ Persian Gulf as they are to defend

Western Europe.
Sixty-four percent of those
questioned Tuesday and’ Wednes-

20,000 acres of snap beans and
4,200 acres of tomatoes,” said Dr.
Alvin Ru gledge of the University of ‘
Tennessee’s Agriculture Extension
Service. '

After Mrs. Canada’s telephone
call, Rep. Dale Kelley of Hunting-
don came to a committee hearing
last week expecting little legislative
squabbling to stunt com’s fruition.

But with the inquisitive mind of a
deliberating lawmaker, Rep. James
McKinney of Nashville, said he had
a better selection.

“Soybeans have been the top
crop the last ﬁve years,” he said.

“if the Soviets invade the Persian

Gulf, where most of our imported

oil comes from.”

y _.

Twenty.-si-x percent said they op-
pose such a use of U.S. troops and
10 percent of the 1,600 adults
interviewed nationwide by tele-
phone were not sure. ’

Only a slightly larger percentage

troops’ fighting off a Soviet attack
on Western Europe. U.S. defense,

“If we’re going tobe serious about
choosing an official state vege-
table, it ought to be something
other than corn.”

After the hearing, Kelley said he
would consider a succotash type

bill—corn and soybeans—and the ,

proposal was sent to the Agricul-
ture committee, which just might

-decide the state vegetable ought to

be a _vegetable.

Mrs. Canada demurred on
soybeans. I

“I’m aware com’s not really a
vegetable,” she said. “But I think
most people think of it as a

policy for decades. e_ 
Twenty-two percent opposed
ﬁghting for Western Europe and 11
percent were not sure. -s '
This ﬁnding is an increase from
that of a Gallup Poll in late 1978,
when 54 percent said they would
back U.S.
Westen Europe.

Faced with the" turbulent world
situation, Americans express a

deﬁnite willingness to use U.S.

For example, despite the Iran-

of the public is willing to sent U.S.

U.S.S.R. invades that country.
Forty percent oppose sending U.S.

Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Conney M.
Kimbo announced Friday a revised residence hall
visitation policy aimed at limiting the students’ right
to hosting overnight guests. .

Under the new policy,‘ to be presented to the Board
of Trustees Feb. 12, resident students will be
permitted overnight guests___of the sa'me= sex no more
than 30 days per term, while guests of the opposite
sex will not, be permitted in the ‘buildings at all
between the hours of 2 a.m. and 10 a.m.

The possibility of instituting such a policy has
repulsed many students to the point of opting to
move off campus next year, conveniently solving the

_ L housing crunch that has plagued Pitt for many years.

‘When the board of trustees delivered a charge to
Kimbo at its last meeting to examine the existing
policies it isn’t likely that among the top priorities
was solving the housing shortage by driving students
off campus to contend with the abundancy of sub-
standard housing, which poses an even greater threat
than poor in—house security.

The board was undoubtedly concerned about the
safety of all students following the rash of rapes last
October and the murder of freshman Monica Renee
Jones in a Towers trashroom last January.

There were obviously several pitfalls not‘

considered in preparing the report for presentation to
the board next week—most notably, the
implementation of the policy.

‘Kimbo said Friday he is uncertain what means‘

would be used tovimplement the policy.

chi lattt News

Page d—Monday, February 4,1980

It seems unfair, as well as unbelievable to suggest
such drastic alterations in a student’s lifestyle

, without offering a carefully detailed summation of

the “hows, whys” of the plan.

There are many unanswered questions in the minds
of returning resident students, as well as high school

seniors who are prospective Pitt students. Will they ‘

be faced with the possibility of single sex dorms? Is

this the first step toward complete reversion back EU"

the academic thinking of the 1950’s?

Kimbo is faced with the task of presenting the plan
to the Board of Trustees on Feb. .12 at the quarterly
meeting. ’

At this time we can urge Kimbo, and the members
of the board to step back and carefully examine the
proposal, once again, while the students to step
forward to question whether the revamped policy is
really in their best interest or whether it is an

alternative hastily prepared under the burning gaze

of a deadline clock. It is the students charge at this
time to demand only the best.

Kimbo, did have the insight to schedule a forum
tonight at 8:15 p.m. in David Lawrence Hall to
discuss the changes with resident students.

We hope that students will take advantage of the
opportunity afforded them t_o question the motives
of the plan, "while demanding the details of how
drastically their lives will be altered as a result of

V these changes.

This letter is in response to
James Morris’ letter of January 25,
1980. Mr. Morris wrote ofhis

My first comment on his letter

concerns his statement that “...the

says he understands it to be the

Mr. Morris.is incorrect when he
asserts SGB could not ‘reserve’the’_
room. _

According to Pitt Union Reser-
vations Guidelines, “any recog-

- nized student organization regis-

tered with‘ the Pitt, Union may use
university facilities for general
meetings.” Now I would assume,
that if a room were reserved for the
purpose of a meeting, others in the
room would be courteous enough
to either carry on their business
quietly or choose another room in
which to “relax, do homework, or
snooze,” instead of interrupting a
scheduled meeting. If members of
SGB were impolite to those who-did
not respect SGB’s right-.to_conducti
a meeting there, _l“a,sk_’-Mr,‘ 'M.o_r_ris:

Mr; Morris also commented.- “If

the student body, why can't the
Student Government?” In the first
place, SGB represents the student
body and should not, by any
means, go out of their way to avoid
them! In fact, this is precisely the
reason_SGB chose such an obvious
meeting place. Complaints

the student body that they conduct
business in out-of-the-way places

such as the _ Lower Lo‘1Tnge..

‘ Arrogance, which Mr. Morris feels

“radiated” from SGB, would seem
more appropriate to me, if SGB had
ignored student,reque_sts and kept
their meetings in a less obvious
setting. I tend to believe, as
opposed to"Mr. Morris, that SGB

Morris’ choice of words, “...skim-

making a decided effort to involve
as many students as" possible. In
fact, not only have they utilized the
Lower Lounge, but future plans

include the use of Tower A

Conference Room and other such

areas available. to‘ students. I think

this is a commendable move on the

part of SGB and- not a move to-
“step on the toes” of other

students. ‘

Perhaps, if moregstuclents would

By NICK ARNETT

“Living in a free country means
you should be free to decide
whether or not you’ll join the
military.” A

That statement makes sense to
me, until it is motivated by fear. At
Pitt’s draft forum, students ex-
pressed fears—fears of being
killed, fears of killing. I respect

‘,4.-hose who assert their feelings, but
"I’ll just as quickly condemin those

who will fearfully refuse to ﬁght. I
Those who say they'll support
military action, but don’t want to
be forced to go, are saying they
want someone. else to ﬁght for
them; > I -

We have a volunteer military
force these days, but take a look at
who makes it up. They aren't white
middle class people like those

found on our campus. They’re.the _

disadvantaged minorities, to whom

-the military is a way out of the
ghetto or other disadvantages.

There are non-minorities in the

 

There’s ‘no way we can justify

 asking them to ﬁght a war for us.

I just learned that Italians,
Germans, and Irish are well-

represented at Pitt, but blacks and -
Poles are not. I guess that means.

our wars won’t be fought" by,
Pittsburgh Italians. - ~ '

At some point, I’m willing’ to

physically ﬁght for myself, a move I‘

don’t like, but accept. It became’
clear to me one afternoon on a bus’
when an allegedly destitute youth
requested my wallet. He said he
had a .38 but wouldn't show it to
me. I injured him. It didn’t bother
me. I retained my wallet. '

Freedom is worth fighting

for—on a bus or globally. Those ‘

among us suffering “identity

crises” are enjoying their freedom. ‘

In Russia, _and more soin Iran,
people don’t have “identity crises”

because they are given an identity.-

How many times have we heard_

Khomeini or a follower say, “We
are Mosleums,” rather than
identifying themselves as individ-
uals? '

They sound like the new wave'

group Devo-—_—‘ ‘We are not men, we

‘are Devo.” '

I The freedom we enjoy lets us
deﬁne ourselves. W-e’re free to

' wander Pittsb_rugh’_s streets like

Lansbury, wearing signs con-
demning the postal service, a

' branch of the United States
_Government.

We're also free to
cop out——to abandon our individ-

‘uality following Jim Jones or
Reverend Moon. Those who died-

in Guyana or who mindlessly follow

Moon do so out of fear—-fear of .
“ﬁnding themselves”

like -the
thousands who head for California
annually. ‘ I

It’s a responsibility, this free-
dom,, which can’t be met by the

’masses in,anything other than a

“free society. ” ‘I would not want to
be a Russian individualist. I'm

certain Sakharovis not enjoying
Gorky. I

I don’t know if the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan »or the
Iranian hostage-taking is a clear
threat to. ‘our. freedom. I’d like

ment. Afghanistan maybe another

"Vietnam,‘_but-"it’s closer to the oil

ﬁeld than .‘_Vietnam. The day I’m
convinced my‘ country's freedom is
threatened, Ifll be ready to ﬁght for
it. When" the_threat is so great that
violence becomes necessary, I may
be afraid, but I won’t go to Canada
because of it— because I won’t be
ﬁghting out’. of fear. The danger of
ﬁghting fearfully is that you
become willing to kill—to strike the
ﬁnal blow. The ﬁnal blow is only
needed if the enemy ﬁghts to the
ﬁnish, which is rare.

In dealing with a country which

:calls itself a community (Moslems

or communists) rather than a group
/of individuals, to kill a’ man is to
wound the nation. When another
nation seriously threatens “us, like

’ - soldiers.

the man on the bus threatened me: ‘I;
It is

it is justiﬁable to wound.
wrong to kill. We need only
disable. A -

I’m against war, but that's an
empty statement. There are no_
sane people who long for war. It
should be avoided, but not at the L.
price of freedom, so let's not be,
.afraid _to ﬁght.

Let's take a look at what our I

ﬁghting for, and if‘ it is. truly

threatened in the Middle East. If A " A

we are in danger, if there is a
nation holding a gun to our heads
or our wallets, then we should be
ready and willing to ﬁght.

Panfhereﬂe Hoopers Get Even Break in Hoosier Slate   

By MARIE HUFF
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pantherette basketball team
broke even this weekend. The
women scored a 66-62 win over
Purdue Friday night before drop-

“ping a 53-47 decision to Indiana on
A Sunday afternoon.

The Panther-
ettes, now 17-8, will be heading

- north for a bout with Slippery Rock

Wednesday night. ,
As predicted, the game with the

Purdue Boilermakers was not an

easy win ‘for the Pantherettes. Al-

though Purdue was 2-10, it opened
up an early lead. The Boilermakers
held a 40-34 ‘edge at halftime,
forcing the Pantherettes to play
catch-up basketball. Once Pitt took

the lead in the second half,
however, it was never to be
relinquished.

Debbie Lewis recorded nine
assists during the evening, giving
her 122 assists for the year. She
broke the record that had been held
by her teammate, Kathy Pacz-
kowski, who had 119 assists last

season.

Penny Welsh was the game-high
scorer with 23 points. Lewis added
13 points, and Pam Miklasevich put
in nine while pulling down 12
rebounds. Laura Newcomb led
Purdue with 21.

For the second time this season.
the Indiana Hoosiers handed Pitt a
defeat. While the Pantherettes
were seeking revenge for an earlier
season loss, the Hoosiers were
making sure that Pitt learned some
respect. Indiana jumped to a

halftime lead, entering the locker
room with .a 30-23 edge.

Pitt again began their comeback.
With three minutes remaining in
the game. the score was knotted at
41. Then an unusual event
occurred. A scoring surge took
place, but it was not Pitt that was
doingsthe scoring." The Hoosiers
tallied eight unanswered points to
put the game out of reach for Pitt.

Welsh and Lewis topped the‘

Pantherette scorers with 12 each,
while Miklasevich and Gail Augh-g

burns snatched 10 rebounds
apiece. Indiana was led by Joan
Ryan, who only sank four buckets.
but went 7-for-7 at the charity
stripe for her 15 points.

When the Pantherettes play
Slippery Rock Wednesday night,
they will be playing the same team
they soundly defeated earlier this
year in the Pitt Invitational 73-40.
However, that_ is the largest margin
of victory in the 12 times they have
met. Pitt holds a slight 7-5 edge i
the series.

I There’s a commoncliche known
to most people that there are only

8 two sure things in life--death and

taxes. But after the events in

,Morgantown Saturday afternoon,

one might want to add" another
certainty--the Pitt basketball team
is sure to lose to West Virginia in

 ,the wvu Coliseum.

made Pitt’s record 1-9 versus WVU
at the 14,000 seat facility. The big
Eastern Eight game was witnessed
by 11,356 fans--the biggest’ crowd
Pitt has played before this year. A
win, coupled with Rutgers’ loss to.
George Washington, would have
put the Panthers at the top of the
league standings. ‘
Instead, the Panthers are 14-6
overall, and 4-2 in the league,
behind Rutgers, and ahead of

Duquesne and Villanova. WVU is
9-10 overall and 2-4 in the league.

' The Panther wrestling squad was
caught looking.ahead_somewhat to
an important match‘.-u,p with Cleve-
land State this past week as they
were upset by.a scrappy Millers-
ville squad 25-12 last Thursday and
grappled-to a 18-18 draw with Lock
Haven Saturday .'at the Field
House. ' ; '

Pitt head coach _Rande Stottle-
myer admitted. that Millersville
would -“-hustle” the Panthers,. but
the Marauders wound up running
the table as they took decisions in
seven out of the 10 matches.

Millersville’s fine 118-pounder
Henry Callie led off the match by
snapping Pitt’s Glenn Maxwell’s
ﬁve-game win streak,’ defeating

Maxwell by the, score of 10-6. p

However, after the 126-pound
match, victories were far and few
between for the Panthers. Recent-
ly returning from an injury, Pitt's
Mike Bond looked sharp as he took
a 12-3 decision away from Marty
Hazella in the 150-pound weight
class.

The only other Pitt win was
accomplished after the match was
well out of hand, when Panther
heavyweight Steve “Smokey”
Smocharski scored a 5-3 decision
over the Marauders’ Ron Wagner.

Against Lock Haven Saturday
night the Panthers were noticeably
fired up. Maxv ell regained his
winning form as he topped Lock
Haven’s Mike Milward at 118
pounds by the score of’ 16-4.
Coming into the match. Milward’s
record was an impressive 17-8-1.

Saturday’s loss was everything a
fan could expect from a Pitt-West

' Virginia game—-plenty of emotion,

lots of atmosphere, «and mucho\
controversy. Both teams could
have complained all day about the
officiating because there were bad
calls both ways. Oddly, 23

. personal fouls were called against

each team, and each made 20 of 30
shots from the free throw line.

But seven of Pitt’s 10 misses
came in the first half, when.the
Panthers made only six of 21 ﬁeld
goal attempts. Strangely, the
Panthers trailed only 29-25 at that
point.

In the second half, West Virginia
Coach Gale Catlett kept his players

- fresh by substituting liberally and

using three freshmen, Russell
Todd, Greg Jones and Diego
McCoy at the same time. Todd and
Jones each scored 14 points to lead
the ‘home team, while McCoy
added 13. ' _

Minus point guard Dwayne
Wallace, the Panthers were very
erratic offensively, and'with Sam
Clancy and Dave Olinger in foul
trouble, it seemed very bleak when
the Mountaineers opened a 60-49
lead late in the game. ‘

But at that point the Pitt defense
made its move by causing several
WVU turnovers on inbounds plays,
forcing jump balls, and covering
field goals by Sammie Ellis (who .

led all scorers with 24), and Pitt’s ‘

most reliable performer this year,
Carlton Neverson. . '8
With WVU leading 63-61, Ellis
stole an errant pass at midcourt.
.Ed.Scheuermann ‘drove the lane
and put up a shot, which bounced
off the rim. Scheuermann was

  

as he wrestled a tight 9-6,decision
away from Lock Haven’s George
D’Augustino at 134 pounds.

Then came the drought, as the
Panthers saw their 12-0 lead
evaporate into a 18-12 Lock Haven
advantage. The problem began.
gradually, starting with a very
tough 7-5 loss by Jeff Gordon to
Lock Haven’s.Ken Parsley (15-4-1).

Following a variety of decisions.
by Lock Haven in the next four '
weight classes, the most decisive
and exciting match, of the night

 Lady Tracksters .
  Eighth in Own Invite

By STEVE THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Writer
The atmosphere at Fitzgerald
Field House, the site of the Pitt
Women’s Indoor Invational Track
Meet, was ﬁlled with continuous
excitement this past weekend.
Several meet records were broken,

thrilling ﬁnishes were common,_,

and the Pantherettes looked
{impressive while ﬁnishing eighth
as the host team in a meet where
the overall talent was truly remark-
able.

“I was pleased .with the per-
formance of all the girls,” said Pitt
head coach Alfreeda Goff. “I was
especially pleased with our 880-
yard relay team, which just
recently was‘ put together and
didn’t have much time to work on
the baton changes.”

That particular team-—Stephanie

“The competition was excellent
as expected, and it seemed like
records were being broken in
almost every event,” said Goff.
“There were outstanding per-
formances in every event by all the
athletes involved.”

The University of Maryland
demonstrated why it is considered
an Eastern power as it breezed to a
first-place finish, followed by

The three Most Valuable ‘Perform-
ers chosen were Moretta Walton of
Maryland, Bridget Leddy of-Villa-
nova and Maria Parsons: of Morgan
State. \ I /

Walton set a new meet record as
she hurled the shot put 50-8, while
Leddy won the 1000'-yard run, the
mile run, and anchored Villanova’s
winning distance medley relay
team. Parsons set a’new‘ meet
record in the 220-yard dash and
ﬁnished _second in the 50-yard

Leslie Palmefof Maryland, who
last year won the 50-yard hurdles
here for Pitt, won it again this year.

“It was just like a homecoming
for her,” said former teammate A
Sciullo. ,

“It has been a long two days,”
said Goff. “The coaches and

athletes felt good about the meet,
which makesme feel good also. I
was pleased that everything
worked ‘out well, and thanks to a
nice enthusiasticcrowd, it was a
great _weekend.”

Both "Pitt gymnastics teams
defeated teams which in the recent
past have been difficult to
overcome.
Temple 231.3-212.75 while the
women" drubbed ex-powerhouse
Clarion 127-114.

“We ﬁnally beat Temple,” said‘

men’s coach Fra_nk D’Amico. “‘It’s
the first _time in about 20 years that

‘we have done so. Although three

of their all-arounds are out with
injuries, we still really stuck it to
them. Twenty points is a big

.margin in gymnastics.”

The women's story is a little
different. Clarion has been a
powerhouse _in gymnastics. \in the
past, but this season the Eagles are

The men downed “

competing minus last year’s coach
and her entire team, (save one
competitor), who all took off for
Florida.

Pantherette coach Donna Sanft
was pleased in downing- Clarion,

but was disappointed in the Pitt"

team score. The low score was
partially due to the fact that
standout performers Bonnie Tress-
Ier and Roxann Evans were unable
to go all-around, because of
injuries. .

In addition, Sanft cited the tough
schedule the Pantherettes have
been on in the last three weeks. In
that period of time, Pitt has had
five’ meets. 9‘ .

‘‘Usually,'’ said Sanft, “one
meet a week is what a gymnast
competes in. There has also been a

lot of traveling involved. We are
physically beat up and exhausted.

We have a week and a half to rest,.

hopefully it will help.”

Sanft said that Holly Martino had
a good meet along with Evans,
who, despite being injured, hit all
the routines she performed.
Gretchen Speich was the other
all-around performer for Pitt.

“The important thing,” said
Sanft, “is to have twogor three very
solid ‘meets going into regionals.
By solid, I mean upwards of 133.
Right now, we have the time to
prepare for regionals, and that is
crucial.” ‘

‘Bob Besong excelled for the
Panthers in their defeat of Temple.

D’Amico. Besong is still
scoring up to his potential, as he
should be in the 50’s.

Besong won two events, the floor
exercise (8.7) and the rings (8.95).
He finished in a tie for second in
the vault with a 9.1, ﬁnishing only
ﬁve-one hundreths behind the
winner. Teammate Chris Femiani
also had a 9.1 and tied Besong.
D’Amico said Besong could have

impressed with the side horse team

  Mountaineer Swimmers Snap Pitt 28-M   feet VVIII        

 By STEVE THOMAS
Pill News Staff Writer

There is a familiar term in the
world of sports commonly known as
“losing.” For Pitt’s swim team,
this term has been inapplicable for
three years. Unfortunately, the
Panthers went down to defeat by
the score of 60-53 to the West
Virginia Mountaineers Saturday in
Morgantown, breaking the nation’s
longest winning streak at 28 meet
victories. _ ‘*

Despite winning the ﬁnal three
events, the Panthers could not
catch the Mounties, who, according
to ‘Pitt backstroke star Stu
Swanson, “all swam great. Their
sprinters turned the tide winning
two of three sprint-freestyle
events.” . '

Swanson, though, did his part by ’
winning the 100-meter backstroke
event with a time of 53.84 and set a
new pool record at WVU. Scott
Winkler also set/a new record in the
three-meter diving event while
Rick Carter won the 100-meter
freestyle event. Carter is ranked
third nationally, while gvanson is
currently ranked ninth. _

Other winners for Pitt included
Sandy Pidgeon in the 200-meter
breaststroke, and the freestyle
relay team of Rick Carter, Tom
McGinley, Jerry Zaleski and Scott
Shearer. I

When, asked about the home
crowd being a difference, McGin-
ley said, “They weren’t intimidat-
ing until West Virginia started
winning events. There was a whole

lot of people there along with a
band that deﬁnitely helped mot-
ivate the team.”

“We are used-to winning and
fans have always taken it for
granted that we would win- They
swam unbelievable times and just .
plain beat us.”

Swanson added, ;“We’re pretty
much down right now. We beat a
good Ohio State squad .earlier this
year, notito mention an even better
North Carolina squad by 20 points.
We knew eventually that we would
have to lose sometime but we
didn't think it would be to West

Virginia.. I think we are ‘better

overall but Saturday just happened A

to be their day.”

Despite various sicknesses, and
injuries this "year, the Panthers
have still managed to maintain a
6-1 record and over three years, a
remarkable 28-1 record.
