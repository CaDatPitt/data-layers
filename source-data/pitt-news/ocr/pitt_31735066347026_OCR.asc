Awarded Medical Fees

Pitt has been ordered to reinstate
medical payments of up to $2000 a
month for a former gymnast who was
paralyzed by an accident during

4‘ gymnastic team practice almost four

years ago.

Common Pleas Judge Marion K.
Finkelhor ordered Pitt to renew
payments on October 1 for Thomas
A. Cardamone,- 25, of Bethel Park
after the university suspended
payments last May.

Pitt had been paying I Carda-
mone’s expenses since shortly after

:ACLU Hits

Canvassing
Ban At Pitt

BY RICH HARRY

Pitt's policy of prohibiting
students from olitical canvassing
on campus is a violation of the first
amendment, according to Ellen
Doyle, director of the Pittsburgh

oﬁchapter of the American Civil

Liberties Union (ACLU).

" “Not allowing a student to voice

liis political support is a violation of
that student’s freedom of speech,"

Doyle said.
Pitt disallows political leafleting
because such action may be

misinterpreted as an endorsement
of a candidate by the University.

State related schools, are ineligible
for state funding if they contribute
funds or endorse a candidate who
could lobby for legislative approp-

‘ ' riations.

Doyle acknowledged that Pitt
was a state-supported institution,
‘but added, ‘‘I don’t see where
allowing students to voice their
political support has to do with
state funding. I don't see the
argument at all.
“There have been instances when
Pitt said it was not supported
enough by the state to be subject to
constitutional mandates," Doyle

5 *3 said. -

It has been reported that in the
past the College Young Repub-
licans have had conﬂicts with the
University concerning canvassing,
but. according 0 Doyle, no one has
approached the ACLU for its
support over the issue.

“We would be willing to take
action against the University if
requested." she said.

ACLU prosecutors at state-sup-
ported Penn State University
brought charges against the school
for violations of the first amend-
ment by restricting freedom &
speech. A court ruling. however.
found Penn State's canvassing
policy constitutional.

“I assume that decision is being
appealed." Doyle said. “We'd
look at the possibility of success
before taking action against the

’§ University."

the 1972 accident.

The judge said assistance must be
resumed by either providing
medical services through a Univer-
sity facility or by cash payments.

In addition, the University was
ordered to provide Cardamone, a
formercheerleader, with a tuition
scholarship to allow him to complete
his education.

The university also must -appoint
someone to advise Cardamone and
his parents of the various human
services and programs available
through community health and
social agencies.

The judge said the Pitt Board of
Trustees must consider within 90
days any terms for settlement of the
Cardamone claims for damages.

Cardamone’s liability suit against
the University will be moved up on
the court calendar so it can be
heard next May, Finkelhor said.

The judge noted she didnot ﬁnd
the University liable in the case.

In October, 1972, Cardamone fell
from a set of steel rings while
practicing in Trees Hall. At the time
of the accident, school officials and
the family signed an agreement
whereby the school would pay all
doctor, medical, drug and therapy
expenses “for alltime or such period
of time as the University may
determine feasible.”

The judge ruled that it has been
Pitt's policy to provide care for all
injured athletes “without limita-
tions as to time or amount. The sole
difference between the ﬁardamone
case and other injured athletes is the
scope and the extent of the
Cardamone injuries.”

BY RICH HARRY

The University Senate has elected
philosphy department chairman
GeraldJ . Massey as its President for
the remainder of the school year.

At a senate meeting Friday,
Massey said he would resist-
“driving a wedge” between faculty
and administration.

“It’s important to remember the
administration’s officers are also
faculty members who are not alien to
teaching and research, but are
familiar with them because of their

.own origins, experiences and

continuing activity,” Massey said.

Massey also commended the
existing relationship between the
administration and faculty. “It’s
fortunate Pitt has a Chancellor and
administration who are sympathetic
and concerned about the faculty’s

role in the governance of the

university. ’ ’
He also said the Senate should
“take the lead” in requiring

administrators to meet the criteria
and high level of performance
expected from faculty involved in
teaching and research.

The names of 12 other Senate
Council and officer winners were
also disclosed at the meeting.
Serving as senate officers will be
Wesley M. Rohrer (Engineering) as
vice president and Norman W.
Mulgrave (Education) as secretary.

Faculty elected to serve on Senate
Council for four years were Myron P.
Garfunkel, Sanford Golin and Ivy R.

McManus from the Faculty of Arts V

and Sciences; William Brown (last
year’s Senate president), Anne R.
Jones and Florence M. McKeiina
from the professional schools; Paul
L. McLain from the Health
Professions; Robert B. Yee and
Karen VanderVen as candidates-at-

New University Senate President GeraldJ . Massey, said Friday that as’
president he will resist efforts to “drive a wedge” between faculty

members and the administration.

large; and William Nelson from the
regional campuses.

In his report to the Senate,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar urged the
University’s schools to combine
efforts to combat what he termed
“super problems of society,”
including hunger, killer diseases
and energy.

He pointed out that research in
corporate and federal laboratories
has been restricted in part by limited
time. “A freer investigative
environment on university campus-
es will raise the possibilities that
breakthroughs concerning these
problems will occur.”

Posvar pointed out the University

Plan, a five-year-forecast for Pitt
operations, has been published. The
document, described by Posvar as
“unusual and dynamic” reports
individual long-range plans of each
school and department in the
university, allowing “us to look
ahead and set priorities over the next
three years, which we couldn’t do in
the past.” ‘

Posvar added he learned Pitt is the
first school to devise such a
comprehensive planning budget.

In other business, Posvar report-
ed has requested $69.5 million in
state funding, a 15% boost over last
year’s appropriation.

October Set For SG Co-op Opening a

AFRIEDA LALI

BY LISA ‘RUBENSTEIN

A target date of the first week in
October has been set for the
opening of the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) food co-op,
following approval last week of a
budget of more than $13,000.

Co-op chairperson Frieda Lalli
explained the budget ﬁgure is high
because it includes $8,600 to
establish credit among the vendors
at the strip district. where the co-op
goods are purchased.

“We can't send someone down
to the strip district in the morning
with over $500 in cash, so we will
do our business by credit," Lalli
said.

The vendors in the strip district
belong to 21 vendors‘ bureau which
arranges for credit to be estab-
lished. Lalli said. She said the
vendors’ bureau would take charge
of billing the co-op.

“As long as the co-op breaks
even. the credit balance with the
vendors should remain the same,”
Lalli said.

The funds approved by the
Allocations Committee include
office supplies and wages for a paid
buyers and cashiers.

Lalli said the co-op committee
hopes to hire a student buyer at
$2.30’ per hour to purchase the
produce each week. She said the
buyer will have to be 21 years or
older to comply with insurance.
guidelines for the co-op van used to
transport the produce.

Three thousand dollars has been
allocated to hire cashiers to collect
money. Since University guide-
lines prohibits students from
collecting money from other
students, cashiers, who will be
considered University employees.
will collect the money. Lalli said

the cashiers will by employed
through the Student Union ticket
ofﬁce.

The co-op committee allocation
was approved last week, after the
deadline for allocation requests,
because the SGB considered the
co—op's spring term activities a trial
run. According to Lalli, the trial
run was a “success" and the co-op
should be operating again by the
first week in October.

All undergraduate full-tiime
students are members of the co-op
because it is partially funded by the
student activitites fee. Lalli said.
Part-time students and graduate
students can become members by
paying a $2 membership fee, and
faculty and staff can become
members through a $2 fee. Co-op
offices are located in 305 Student
Union. Lalli said all members will
be asked to contribute some labor
topco-op operations. although the
quota has not been determined.

Open Adoption Records Low

BYMREACSORBA
3

Betty Jane Lifton, author of Twice
Born: Memoirs of an Adopted
Daughter, brought her crusade
against sealed adoption ﬁles to
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic Friday.

Speaking before a group of
Western Psychiatric therapists,
Lifton, herself adopted, said the
lawsthatinstitutedconﬁdentialityof
adoption records 40 years ago are no
longer wanted by the parties

I involved.

Lifton said though the law is
presently being contested in court,
but it is important that therapists
realize how detrimental sealing the
truth against the adopted child is.‘
Private agencies, however, are not
subject to state rule. “About 50% of
adoptions are transacted by private
agencies, which are not effected by
that law, yet these agencies too,
perpetrate the veil of secrecy.”

The most important reason for

‘unlocking the ﬁles, Lifton said, is to
satisfy the child’s,deep psychologi-

I cal need to know who and what his

parents were.

“Many of these children exper-
ience a ‘ﬂoating feeling’ because
their basic security line has been
severed. They look in the streets
searching faces in hopes of finding
their real parents. Many feel
non-existent because their natural
line of continuity has been broken. ’ ’

An adopted child may be told he

‘vas adopted, but nothing more,

‘since often the adopting parents
themselves do not have more facts.
So the child is left with the pieces of
an unsolved puzzle.

Locked records also leave the
adopted uncertain of their genetic
makeup, Lifton said. “I was

convinced I would have mongoloid
children,” Lifton, the mother of a
healthy 12 year old, said.
“Agencies tell you they record the
medical background of the parents,
but what that comes down to is the
medical history of a young mother in
her teens. -The ﬁle is rarely
up-dated, so no one knows what
hereditary illness shows up later.”
Open records also would free the
child from obsessional fantasies
over his real parents. “It is natural
for childrep to have ‘family

romances’ involving a set of
imaginary parents who are kings and
queens. But it is not the same for
adoptees. The adopted child will
have the queen and king._fant8S1eS.
but will also have to wrestle with the
possibility that -his parents were
murderers, rapists or whores,
Lifton said.

To many, the search for their
natural parents becomes an obses-
sion in which the child seems to be
ﬁghting a conspiracy against his
natural right to know.

Science and Society:
A Love-Hate Affair

BY BARB THOMAS

Society has a love-hate relation-
ship with technology, coveting its
luxuries and resentirq its intrusi-
ons, according to D1 Edward E.
David Jrs., former presidential
science advisor who spoke in
Benedum Auditorium Friday.

“Rapid technological changes
can and does induce neurotic
reaction,’ ’ David said, quoting from
Alvin‘ Tofﬂer’s Future Shock.
Forced changes are harmful, but
changes people initiate themselves‘
are more easily accepted, David
said. A

Technological transformations
are signiﬁcant only in relation to
economical, social, legal and
political aspects of society, David
said during his lecture entitled
“Technology for Society: Boom or
Bust?”

Economic growth, David said, has
been increased 30 to 70% by
technology, expanding industry and
increasing production efﬁciency.

«Trying to explain technology’s
part in today’ s society, David quoted
former U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Daniel Patrick

Moynihan. “Technology is not a
secret, it is a system.”
David said the U.S. has

technological agreements with 25
countries to avoid complete depen-
dence on a single nation by
balancing exchange of technology,
trade and natural resources among
them.

For example, Japan gets most of
its natural resources from Third
World countries, while the United
States continues to deplete its own
resources and import increasing
amounts of raw materials.

David also said that total
perceptions of the world can be

-changed by small technological

revolutions, like the camera.

Unifying technological research
under the federal government
squelches such creativity, David
said. Technoogy can best be served

by small industries, education
research funds and individual
initiative.

Ending on an optimistic note, he
said technology can help with arms
control, environmental and popula-
tion problems, making a stable and
liveable future, but only if man
permits it.

He acknowledged in the past Pitt

Concluding his report, Posvar
stated, “We are entering a new

physical size and our stress will be on
qualitative improvement of all
aspects of the university—students,
faculty, programs and research.

“Despite all the pitfalls and

FORD DIPS INTO SOUTH
By Associated Press
President Ford launched the

second phase of a political drive
across Jimmy Carter’s Southland

yesterday while the Democratic

presidential nominee campaigned in

California, talking taxes and looking

for the Mexican-American vote.

Ford rode a 153-mile motorcade
from New Orleans across the Gulf
coast resort area of Mississippi and
Alabama in a mission aimed at
showing that Carter, though a
Georgian, has no hammerlock on the
votes of conservative-minded South-

ern voters.

‘ ‘The best way to win the battle of
the cost of living is to reduce the cost
of government,” he told a crowd of
about 2 ,000 persons outside the local

library in Bay St. Louis, Miss.

“There are some people running
for this ofﬁce of President that want
to add more and more spending,
bigger and bigger deficits, more and

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Textbooks of Tomorrow

There are few reminders of the turbulent 60s left on campus. The
University of Pittsburgh, which was in the vanguard of the protest
movement, has become a place where the biggest political problem is

apathy-

The difference betweentoday’s university andthat of a decade  is
made clear by the University policy which prohibits political canvassing

on University property.

We realize the University is somewhat forced by state policies that say
Pitt is not allowed to endorse any political candidate who would have the
powerto lobbyfor legislative appropriations to Pitt. Giving permission to
a political candidate to canvas the campus might be construed as

endorsing that candidate.

Nonetheless, wethinkthe University, and the student political groups
on campus should work to ﬁght this state policy.

The policy against canvassing violates the I-irst Amendment by
restricting where a person may make lmown his ideas.

A student has a right to be politically active in his own community, and
that community, nine months out of the year, is Pitt.

Canvassing by all of the political groups on campus can only result in a
better informed student body. In any event, why even have student
political groups if they can’t openly work for their candidates?

We're in favor of anything that can get the Pitt student politically
involved. The political ideas of today are the textbooks of tomorrow and
when a student leaves Pitt, he should have more than a diploma: He
should have sortie idea of what’s going on in the world. The political

Pin Crowd

Disgraced Team

After attending my first Pitt
football game, [became dishearten-
ed at the relative lack of
unadulterated team spirit. What is
unadulterated spirit? It is
unrelinquishing fervor to the team,
deriving from the sober instincts of
the fans.

True, Pitt supports its football
players like Plains, Ga., supports
Jimmy Carter, but a large section of

- the student rooters still ﬁnd the need

to be rude to the opposing team, the
referees and even their own

g’ Panthers. This is a disgrace to any

team and really demonstrates the
ignobility of the crowd.

The root of this problem seems to
lie at the mental state of the
spectators. Most fans sit with their
friends, cheer for the Panthers’
successful tactics and groan other-
wise. But the others, usually after an
immeasurable dose of alcohol, thrill
to the good plays and curse out the
Panthers for the bad. This lack of
support can, in the long run, injure
the Panthers’ psychological condi-
tion enough to affect their playing
performance. I

And, as if this weren't enough,

 any penalties fairly administered to

the Panthers arouse the baseness of
the inebriated “fans” to the point
where they shout very crude
obscenities at the referees with quite
negative connotations as to their
competency, parentage, masculin-
ity and sexual behavior.

All in all, the semi-consciousness
of the crowd, the debasing

comments, the drunkenness and the \

lack of consideration for the other
team detracts severely from the
intents of the game—to provide a
legal type of rugged competition, to
supply entertainment and to
increase school spirit and unity.

Frots Need To
C0mpromise

Since the townhouses were built
on Bayard Street above Neville, a
battle has ensued between the

townhouses and the fraternity
houses.

I hope to offer a distant view,
FROM WHERE I SIT!

Having spent a portion of my
academic residence on Bayard
Street I’m acutely aware of the great
friction that has been part and parcel
of “fraternity row.”

The following is not meant to
offend anyone of the combatants,
but to interject some possible
solutions that were used in years
gone by.

Since it is almost impossible to rid
the neighborhood of the fraternity
houses. it is well within the realm of
reality that the fraternity men and

the neighbors call a real intelligent
truce to find a decent workable
solution and stop clogging our
overburdened system with the
trivial accusations regarding prob-
lems that the fraternity men have no
control over. That problem is trash!
’ If the City of Pittsburgh served the
fraternity houses as well as the
neighbors, the trash problem would
all but become a constant problem
thus losing it’s place as a valid
argument. I can't speak for the
fraternity gentlemen but my past
residency on Bayard Street has
shown that Bayard Street can really
jump during the party season, the
noise can be expected. But there is
no reason for a certain house to have
a band in the living room projecting
the noise toward the townhouses!
That still remains a valid argument!
The incidents of people urinating
on the neighbors lawns is a valid
complaint that has gone unresolved
since the combination of too many
people and not enough patience to

gut feeling that “Well, I don’t live
here, so I can do as I please.”

It is rather odd for a fraternity man

who lives on this block to walk out (‘ﬁt-bl

his house to answer the call to
nature.

Therefore many answering the

'call don’t live on Bayard Street. _

A closing comment for both sides
of Bayard Street:

Fraternity men and neighbors
alike, somehow you will have to learn
the delicate art of being ﬂexible mg
not be afraid to COMPROMISE.

That’s right, the last word was
compromise—it’s an old fashioned

art of confrontation and facing the’

problem head-on. The courts have
far greater things to place on it's
docket than the host of misunder-
standings between neighbors. No
one has sought to face this problem
head-on and_ your option has
expired!

A Statement of Conscience

AS black Catholic priests, we wish
to go on record with a statement of
conscience on the comparative
silence of the Christian churches in
face of the latest massacres of black
demonstrators protesting
and horrible oppression of Black
people in South Africa.

This silence is in striking
contrast to the very vocal stand
taken by most Christian churches
on_ the abortion issue. As Roman
Catholic priests, we adhere whole-
heartedly to the authentic and
orthodox position that life in the
womb is as sacred as life outside
the womb; a position which
coincides very closely with the
traditional ehtics of our ancestral
African culture. But what we can
neither conprehend nor mutely

insane '

accept is the comparative silence of
the churches in the face of
organized attacks on life outside
the womb on the scale of those
presently being perpetrated by
racist regimes in South Africa
against the indigenous African
population.

The American news media has
cooperated excellently with agents
of our own government in their
attempts to persuade us that
oppression in South Africa is being
gradually phased out, and this
blatant cooperation has apparently
evoked no strong response from
either the Christian press or pulpit.

Yet, all the while, actual news
reports from African sources bear
witness to the mounting dissatis-
faction and despair of the Black

masses, a despair which belies the
aura of benevolence exuded by the
White elitist government spokes-
men.

The voices silenced by the
bullets of police riot-squads are
clearly recognizable as the voices of
men and women who are being
progressively pressured into con-
centration camp situations on their
own native soil. This is a sin which
shouts to God for vengeance.

We certainly agree with a recent
Vatican communication emphas-
izing the unalterable opposition of
Pope Paul VI to a revolutionary
dialectic based on the denial of God
and on the affirmation on the
inevitability of violent class strug-
gle. As Catholic priests. we have

no problem in rejecting atheism or

the theory that man has to indulge
in violence by his very nature. We
cannot. however, ignore the
recorded fact that the lack of
outspoken leadership in the various
churches, in the face of the

_ oppression of the poor and peoples

of color, has itself actually been the
silent overture to the major
revolutions of modern history.

To revert to the specific issue of
abortion, only recently, case
histories from the former Port-
uguese colonies of Angola and
Mozambique in the period prior to
their liberation from colonial
domination abounded with ex-
amples of pregnant African women
who had babies beaten out of them
or delivered stillborn during forced
labor on road-building projects.
Why weren't the Christian
churches screaming at these
abortions?

If the 200 black lives recently

‘mowed down by racist guns in

Soweto in South Africa were

The following article was written
by Jimmy Love, a student involved
with the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee of Student Government.

The 1960s in America yielded many
great things: puff basketball, James
Brown, automatic ﬁne. tuning and
sugar free soda pop, to mention but a
few. This same decade, on the other
hand, spawned its share of not-so-
great things, such as recalled autos,
urban race riots and elephant jokes,
as well as in-numerable acts of
governmental buffoonery. Of
course, no list of the 60s not-so-
great things could be complete
without including the college
campus drug bust.

The campus drug bust, in its
original, mid-to-late 1960s form,
was an effort on the part of police
departments and drug agencies to
deal with the lawlessness they
perceived on campuses and, in so
doing, prevent -the societal decay
they predicted as a result ‘of this
lawlessness.

Another factor that enhanced the
popularity of the college drug raid
was the fear, based largely on
misinformation and high school
health class attitudes. of drugs and
their effects.

Drug users were generally
perceived by police of that time as
incoherent, murderous zombies who
twitched con stantly and slobbered at
the sight of a Hershey bar.

In an effort not to be outdone, the
college students of the period
cultivated their own plot of myths
regarding drugs, the major theme of
which is that drugs are good for both
body and soul. The extension of this
simple, easy-to-remember principle
led to its corollary: Those persons
and things which prevent us from
taking drugs are bad for body and
soul. In turn, thisledto the growth of
paranoid (or at best, prejudicial) bits

.of misinformation regarding the

enforcers of drug laws, e.g., cops
love to bust kids, have a monthly
drug arrest quota and can and do
make arrests for ‘ ‘suspicion of resin
on tooth enamel."

But the college drug bust is more
than a mere relic of a decade past.
Like James Brown and puff
basketball, it is still very much with
us; only its presence is not as
alarming. College students have
cast off many ofthe silly myths about
drugs and the law, in the 70s.

Unfortunately, some of these
myths have been replaced by silly,
new ones. A

To meet the need for down-to-
earth information on being busted
(and we still do need some———13 Pitt
students were nabbed on drug
charges last year), this article will
attempt to explain the actual
mechanics ofa drug bust, your rights
and obligations during the bust and

what to expect in jail, in addition to a
few hints to make the whole thing go
a little better.

It should be noted from the start
that there are no absolutes in a drug
bust situation and it would be foolish
to present this article_ as if there are
some. But, you argue, we are “not a
nation of men, but a nation of laws, ’ ’
laws which should make all
situations under law absolute ones.
True, but as long as our laws are
enforced by people of differing
temperaments and priorities, there
will be no absolutes.

In other words, some cops treat
the bust situation with a hostile,
sadistic attitude, while others prefer
to do quick, thorough jobs without
making enemies. Hopefully this
article will equip you to deal with
both type of cops and all those in
between.

Like fingerprints and snowflakes,
no two busts are the same. But, for
our purposes, they can be divided
into two basic types: arrests on
search warrants and what we will call
“plain view” arrests.

Police need no warrant when they
see the actual crime take place. For
example, acop receives acall about a
noisy party and checks it out. At the
party, he sees drugs in plain view.
He can then make arrests—arrests
that stick. This is just bad luck.

In most other cases involving
“plain view” arrests, the arrested
person is a victim of his own stupidity
or lack of discretion. This is the type
of person who lights his bong on
crowded buses, rolls joints on busy
street corners and snorts coke at the
Policemen’s Ball. The advice here
will be wasted on people who insist
upon such practices.

However, the law, in its inﬁnite
mercy and wisdom, decrees that
even the indiscrete and stupid have
their rights. In that light, such
persons would do well to read on in
order to gain much lost ground.

In order to make a search for
drugs, a police ofﬁcer must swear
out a statement before a judge.
Included as part of this statement are
the name and address of the suspect
and the types of drugs the ofﬁcer
plans to seize. This . statement

becomes part of the face of warrant _

along with other details, most
importantly, the date and time of day
on which the search may be lawfully
conducted.

Armed with a warrant, this ofﬁcer
and a few others arrive at the
designated time and place, rap on
the door, announce themselves as
police and present the student
bustee with a personalized copy of
the warrant. A search of the
premises ensues, the dope is put into
numbered, tagged baggies and the
student is placed under arrest.

That doesn't sound too gruesome.
The reason? The description above

deals with the text-book drug
bust—the way it's supposed to
happen. Sadly, these cases are
much too few. More often than not,
at least one thing will go wrong.
Heading the list of these

deviations is that the cops, guns
drawn, will ﬁrst break the door down
and then knock. With the exception
of cops who like breaking doors and
other cops whose mothers never
hugged them as babies, police do
By

this with sound reason.

announcing their presence from in
front of a closed door, they run two
undesirable risks: the possibility of
potential evidence is being destroy-
ed, and the possibility‘ that the
individuals inside are armed and
stupid enough to engage the cops in
gunplay. Crashing the door down
reduces both risks markedly.

If the cops do knock and you wish
to save your door, open it
immediately, taking care to avoid
such remarks as “I’ll be there in a
minute-I’m in the bathroom.”

Another area that causes undue
problems takes us back to the
warrant. By law, the police have to
let you see a copy, but you needn’t
get impatient if they don ’t. If they"do
have one, you’ll get your copy soon
enough; if they don't have one,
you've already won your court case.

If, after checking your copy, you
detect errors, don't bother bringing
them up. After swearing out a
warrant and scheduling a bust, the
cop will not say, “Oh, how silly ofus,
so sorry to have bothered you.” In
the highly unlikely event that the
cops do split after realizing a mistake
on the warrant, you’d better believe
they'll be back in two hours with a
warrant capable of withstanding
microscopic examination. When

that happens, you've just blown a

wonderful way ofbeating the cops in
court.

Do not argue the ﬁne points of law
with the cops. First of all, unless you
and the cops are practicing
attorneys, none of you even knows
the ﬁne points. In addition, telling
the cops how to do their jobs does
little to diminish the tension present
in the most tranquil of busts.

This brings us to the ugliest facet
of being busted—-the black eyes,
bloody noses and fractured skulls.

 

bust violence is impossible (espec-
ially when the Feds are concerned),
thereare a few things to remember.

The first of these deals with fear
and tension. Believe it or not, the
cops that bust your room or
apartment will be just as scared as
you—and not without reason. Too
many cops, (not just those on drug
bust but even those on routine calls)
have been punched out, sliced up
and blown away. To prevent this, the
cops involved in a bust will try to gain
the upper hand by controlling the
people in the room or apartment with
all possible speed.

This means they will enter
quickly, often with their guns drawn,
and proceed to grab, poke, shove

.and otherwise handle the people

present in a rough manner. If and
when this happens to you, do not
struggle, resist or cry out; in all
probability the rough-and-ready
treatment will run its course as soon
as the police are sure they have
gotten everyone in the apartment or
suite in a single location. Once
satisﬁed that no one poses a threat to
their security, the cops will
commence their search, leaving you
huddled on the sofa to chain-smoke
under the watchful eyes ofone or two
ofﬁcers.

According to Lt. Sam Conte of the
Pitt Campus Police, student cooper-
ation in a bust yields best results for
all parties concerned and “getting
mouthy or ‘physical’ with the cop
during a bust” is the most foolish
thing a student can do.

This holds true for three reasons,
the ﬁrst of which is that by baiting or
battling the police, a student stands
an overwhelming chance of having
the last ounce of shit knocked out of
him. A case in point took place last
year in the Towers, where a student
named in a warrant took on ﬁve burly
Feds with an empty Sangria bottle.
The student did anumber on the ﬁrst
narc, but enjoyed very poor luck with
the remaining four. He probably still
aches. .

The other two reasons greatly
affect your status as a criminal. If
you engage the cops in combat
during any type of bust, you are sure
to be written up for assault on an
ofﬁcer and resisting arrest charges,
extras you can easily live without.
The existence of these extra charges
will also cost you more money for
bail, since the judge will take into
account the fact that you did not wish
to “cooperate.”

During a given campus drug bust,
the greatest outrage occurs when
cops employ force, not as a means of
establishing a secure environment
in which to execute their lawful duty,
but rather for the sadistic hell of it, to
make people suffer, bleed and ache.
Although there is little you can do
during an act of cop brutality (the
disadvantages of ﬁghting should be
obvious), you can settle the score
eventually.

According to Conte, “In a
situation where the cop is abusive, a
kid is still better off to be peaceable
and still cooper-ate...then ﬁle a
complaint.” The proper channel for
such complaints is the internal
affairs division of the police agency
that busted you.

There are other, though not as
brutal, outrageous police activities
that fall under this heading. For
example, do not be surprised if the
cops take more than your dope with
them after a search. They often take
with them your food, liquor, skin
magazines and sometimes, though
less frequently, money and" jewelry.

If this happens , do not confront them A

on the subject because they will
laugh in your face. Simply report
such incidents to the division of
internal affairs.

Whether you’re busted “plain
view” or on a warrant, whether
you’re busted by Feds, state boys,
city or campus cops, you’ll
eventually end up in one of three
downtown locations: The Public
Safety Building (for campus and city
police cases), the County Jail or the

Woman President A First For Society

BY SUSAN SKLAR

Another sex barrier at‘ Pitt has been
broken. Phi Eta Sigma,_a formerly
all male freshman honor society
has elected it's first women
president.

The society, founded in 1923,
admits students who have achieved
a 3.5 grade average or above in the
ﬁrst semester of their ﬁrst year.
Women were excluded until March
of last year when TitleIX, a Health
Education and Welfare Depart-
ment educational amendment was
enacted.

Title IX requires that all
extra-curricular activities admit
students without regard to sex. So

izations Phi Eta Sigma began to
admit women into its ranks. Pitt's
Phi Eta Sigma chapter claims
approximately 1,000 members.
Last. year the society initiated 155
women and 145 men. Thus this
chapter now has the largest
number of women in the nation.
Alexandra Kreps, a junior
bio-chemistry major, is not impres--
sed with her historical feat. She

defeated two male presidential
candidates in the September
election. Last year she became the
ﬁrst female ofﬁcer of Phi Eta Sigma
when she was elected treasurer.
“I think I won because I was the
best person for the job, not because
I am a woman,” Kreps said.
She does not consider herself a

equal pay and equal jobs, but I
don't want things so equal the male

Kreps said. ‘

addition,two $100 scholarships are
‘awarded to those seniors who have

organization. The society holds

monthly meetings which feature
guest speakers.

Kreps explained that in the past
Phi Eta Sigma existed in name
only. Students would pay their $25
dues, which would entitle them to
an honorary banquet, a society
key, a membership certiﬁcate,
magazine and t-shirt, and there-
after would add their membership
status to applications and resumes.

But last year,» according to
Kreps, the society expanded its
horizons. It participated in social
events such as Pitt's banner rally
barrel- rolling contest and it
sponsored a party.

But the society’s most important
function, according to Kreps, is its
tutoring program. Phi Eta Sigma.
working through the Learning

‘Skills Center and math workshop,

is the only undergraduate organ-
ization on campus that ofers free
tutoring to students. Over one half
of the organization's members are
tutors and Kreps wants to increase
that number. In addition, some
members have been trained and
work as student academic coun-
selors at Pitt.
“I hope to make Phi Eta Sigma a
renowned student organization
before I am through as president,”
Kreps said. “I am enthusiastic
about my new job and hope that I
will inspire other students to strive
for academic excellence.”

As far as being the first woman
president Kreps said, “It was sort
of an accident.” .

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

The art of hitching a ride probably
started when the first hobo found the
ﬁrst unlocked box car. As the
machine age progressed, armies of
teenagers, thumb out, appeared on
the berms of the nation’s highways.
It was only a matter of time until the
state of the art reached unpreceden-
ted heights as hitchhiking took to the
air.

While still not common, there is a
growing number of college students
who have found that ﬂying is the only
way to travel.

The advantages of hitching a ride
on an airplane as opposed to the
usual truck or car is obvious. Good
coast to coast travel time for the
ground bound hitchhikeris a week to
ten days; his airborne counterpart
can do it in as little as a day and a half.

Of course, there is a bit more
forethought involved in hitching a
ride on an airplane.

First of all, you’ve got to decide
where you want to go.

While this mayjseem to be an
elementary consideration, it is
actually very important to your
planning. The smaller the city or
town you want to get to, the tougher
it is to: (a) Find an airport near it; (b)
Find airplanes that ﬂyto that airport.
In many instances, you had better
plan to land at a fairly large
municipal airport and thumb to your

,final destination.
3, Your starting point is another vital

consideration. Again, if you try to
hitch a ride from a local grass strip,
you might siton the ground a week
before getting aride to anywhere, let
alone the place you want to go.
Conversely, it is not only impossible
to get alift at a very large airport, but
it is also a very good way to get
arrested for trespassing or—at some
of the i more security-minded
airports—get a free trip to the local
FBI headquarters on suspicion of

 hijacking.

Pick a busy A general aviation
airport. Probably one of the most
ideal airports in the nation, as far as
bumming ritiec. is Allegheny County
Airport, only five miles away from
the Oakland Campus. The third
largest general aviation airport in

defined as all aviation that isn’t

All in all, it’s an ideal place to
start. Other places in the country
that are good are Chicago’s Midway
Field, Cleveland’ s Lakefront Airport
and National Airport in Washington.
Remember, Greater Pitt, JFK and
Dulles International are for paying
customers only.

The next thing you do even before
showing your face at an airport is to
make yourself presentable.

This cannot be

Volkswagen—sized and even a
slightly unwashed body becomes
unbearable.
Dress neatly, but comfortably. In
the wintertime, put on your heaviest
clothes. While the temperature at
the airport is a cold 25 degrees or so,

the temperature at 10,000 feet might
be -25, and aircraft cabins, though
equipped with heaters, tend to be a
wee" bit on the chilly side. In
general, putting on your best set of
jeans should suffice.

Plan .on packing light. Consider-
ing the cost and size of some
privately owned aircraft, it is
surprising just howlittle weight they
can haul. Also, aircraft baggage
areas tend to be rather small. Your
best bet is to limit yourself to 20

Reagan Republicans who will
deﬁnitely frown upon any signs of
hippieness in prospective passen-
gers. In other words, if you’re really
desperate, get a haircut. ‘

Once you are cleaned, scrubbed
and packed, it is time toﬁnd a pilot
who is willing to give you a ride.
When you get to the airport you will
see men running around in ﬂight
suits and baseball caps. The pilots,
right? Wrong. Chances are they’re
line boysormechanics. Look around

pounds of baggage in one small
backpack.

When preparing yourself, just
remember that you’re dealing with
small, cramped spaces where every
pound must be taken into considera-
tion and where it is extremely easy to
tell what a fellow passenger ate for
lunch.

Also remember that the average
pilot is abusinessman who has spent
up to $4,000 for his pilot’s license
with instrument and multi-engine
ratings. The airplane he ﬂys costs
anywhere from $20,000 to $350,000.

Of course, there are more subtle
ways to go about asking but it boils.
down to the same thing.

Chances of success on the first try
are slim, but most pilots, in refusing,
are polite about it. More times than
not, they’ll volunteer information
about other pilots who might be able
to help you out.

Iknew a beautiful UCLA coed who
wouldiisually ask only one pilot for a
lift. Even if he said no, word would
spread and within an hour, she
would get a lift. While it might take
longer for the rest of us, it does prove
that there are empty seats to be had.

In other words, keep trying until
you succeed. The ﬁrst time is the
hardest because after you get to the
next airport, the pilot who ﬂew you
there can probably connect you with
someone who ’ s ﬂying farther toward
your destination.

Assuming success, there are still a
few things to remember. Pilots,
while" conservative, are a bit free
spirited in their own way. After you
pass their initial inspection, they’ll
enjoy a good conversation even if you
prove to be more radical than you
had ﬁrst appeared. There’s a bit of
the Walter Mitty in each pilot and
he’ll understand if you think a little

differently than most people.

While ﬂying, never ask a a pilot if
he or his plane can ﬂy aerobatics-
they like to prove they can. I once
made that mistake and the pilot
whipped the plane through every

stunt he knew until I had to deposit
my lunch (which I had eaten two
hours before) in a small plastic bag.

Don’t be afraid .to get airsick.
Everybody does at least once—even
airline captains. Pilots will be very
understanding, but there is arule as
old as ﬂying itself: If it’s your mess,
you clean it up.

Don't use fountain pens or butane
lighters when ﬂying to high
altitudes. The higher you go, the less
atmospheric pressure there is, but
the pressure inside the lighter and
fountain pen remain unchanged-
until youtry to use them. This means
that by “ﬂicking your Bic” at 12,000
feet, you can turn an ordinary pocket
lighter into a fairly decent replica of a
ﬂame thrower. The liquid butane,
under higher pressure than the
surrounding atmosphere, comes
rushing out.

I once used a fountain pen on a
ﬂight and when it came time to thank
the pilot, all I could offer him was a
sweaty, blue hand.

Finally, don’t ever, ever, offer to
help pay the expenses. The
operating costs for some of these

planes are a little bit more expensive '

than a year’s education at Pitt.‘

There are, of course, many other
techniques that can be used, but
they come only with experience. The
point is that, while not easy, it is
possible to be winging your way to
Grandma’s house for Thanksgiving
while you earthbound fellow
students must stick out their thumbs
and hope for the best.

‘Red Ryder’ Rides It High

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

There are plays of delight, and
plays of sorrow and plays of
well. . .discomfort. When You Comin
Back Red Ryder is a play of
discomfort, and last week’s revival
on the Stephen Foster Mainstage
succeeded in undermining, upset-
ting and bothering every member of
the audience. ’

Red Ryder is a play taking a look
back to the end of the 60s, and the
terrible self-realization Americans
had to make. American kids commit
atrocities, American government
lies, American presidents cheat,
American ethics are unreal, Ameri-
can unity is a joke.

The play‘ ' aims to treat this
destruction of comfortable myths in
the setting of a backwater New
Mexico diner. The set is real, as if
transported from the guts of some
greasy institution along I-79.

Likewise the lighting. There are no
surreal, modernistic shapes of
plastic or cloth to help us distinguish
what we will see from reality. It has a
documentary feel about it.

On this set at the opening slouches
one Red Ryder, who’s real name is

Stephen and although he’s too far-

away to smell, you have a good idea it
would be a mixture of Marlboros,
GUTS cologne and the sweat of a
long night slinging the hash for
customers. ‘

Ryder, as played by Robin
Robinson, is a ridiculous vestige of
the 50s. Slick hair, well-honed
repertoire of come-backs, snotty,
pointy shoes, Ryder sits in this diner,
and in this small little town, nursing
his self-image and his hopes of
escape to Baton Rouge.

Robinson’s portrayal of this punk
is well-timed and nearly ﬂawless.
Ryder is both amusing in his concise
appraisal of his situation and
pathetic in his strutting portrayal of
what he feels real people do in real
situations.

' The people who ﬁll up the stage
are each a small section of the
mythology with which this country
oils its spiritual machinery. There’s
Angel, played by Elizabeth A. Lott, a

I good girl, a nice girl, a chubby girl, a

girl that lives with her Ma and the
Grandmother. There’s Lyle, a man
who wears a leg brace, and who is
kind, warm and forgiving. There’s
Richard and Clarisse, played by
Jeffrey Kramer and Paula Swart
respectively, two nice intellectuals,
smart enough for tenure, rich
enough to own a rare antique violin,
and yet, ‘ ‘common’ ’ enough to eat in
a real diner with the unwashed. A
bunch of real nice people.

Enter the ﬁgure of Ted, a Vietnam
vet, slightly mad, slightly brilliant,
overwhelmingly desperate to get his
broken van repaired so he can finish
a run of dope into California.

Ted, played to the last ounce of
venom by Christopher Rawson, is a
witty, lunatic sadistic dreg. With no
scruples, no fears and no dreams,
yet armed with a laser sharp
intelligence, he proceeds to cut away
the cocoons of normalcy from the
others in the diner. First slowly, just
sniggering asides. Finally, a gun in
hand he seizes control of the people,
into acts of
unnerving nakedness, the king that

stir up winces from the audience,’

and nervous, embarrassed giggling.

It’s toolate now to catch Christopher Rawson’s electrifying portrayal of
Teddy in last weekend’s production of When You Comin’ Back Red

Ryder.

It’s not enough for Ted to get his
car ﬁxed. He has to destroy, by wit,
by force and by naked, cruel,
accurate commentary every shred of
self-respect, self-image and comfor-
table myth present in the diner.

Of all the characters, Ted is the
only one who moves inside the diner
freely. In the little arena of
Fly-Speck Yellow walls, old-green
booths and Formica tops each
character stakes out a little territory.
Ted is the one who leans close, who
dares to touch strangers, who
whispers intimately. Ted’ s repeated
invasion of the other character's
private space both increases our
feeling of discomfort and under-
scores his power.

It’s a credit to Rawson that the
audience squirmed nearly as much
as prisoners on stage. They were
afraidthis unbound devil would spin
around, his army surplus jacket
whirling, point his ﬁnger at them,
yes them, ﬁghting for the arm rest in
the fourth row, and begin to claw at
their cocoon, their baffling, their
facades. Maybe (worse yet) turn a
spotlight on them!

As the play unfolds, the
embarrassment of audience and
victims grow, and Ted acts out
greater and more elaborate fantas-
ies as the diner becomes a kind of
concentration camp.

Ted levels blast after blast at Red
Ryder. Why he’ s so interested in the
greasy punk is not quite certain, a
point never deliniated in the play.
The interplay between the two" was
well-polished, smooth and conver-
sational.

It's in this interplay between Ted
and Red that the audience is
ultimately forced to choose Red as a
focus for indentiﬁcation. His violent
and loathsome peccadillos aside,
Ted's character is as mysterious,

sudden and impersonal as a natural
force. It is impossible to identify
with a hurricane, or a tornado, or an
eruption. Red Ryder, on the other
hand is pitiable, human and far more
worthy of any emotion, be it distaste
or sympathy.

In fact it is this contrast that is
never resolved in the play. We never
learn of Ted’ s motivation, other than
his involvement in the Vietnam war
and passing education. In the end
we must believe that he returned to

the hot dust and asphalt from
whence he appeared.

In the end, with the van repaired,
Ted readies his escape, binding the
victims in the diner with masking
tape and bandage adhesive. He
hands Red a steak knife.

Red tries to kill this man from the
road, A but is struck down, and
ridiculed in the bargain, threatened
with immediate death at the end of
Ted's weapon.

Nose to the dirty, cigarette butt
floor, Red Ryder cries and blows snot
on himself. Prostate, defeated,
ridiculed, aware ofhis weakness, his
thin arms, his virginity, his
stupidity: He seems totally and
ﬁnall ruined.

A kind of shock settles on the
victims of the diner as Ted exits,
abandoning his sidekick Cheryl with
all the regret of a broken shoelace.
When they ﬁnally are released, Red
leaves.

He grabs his every earthly
possession in the diner, tells
someone to tell his Mom good bye,
and shoots out the diner door with a
long, happy, release of “So Long
Suckers!”

In the end, Ryder escapes. But it
took this kind of violence, this kind of
ignominy to bring him to the ﬁnal act
of good bye and a long ride to Baton
Rouge for a job where they wear
tuxedos in a fine restaurant. Not

Dionne Warwick Sets

One Classy Stage

BY PAMELAEUSI

Saturday night at the Syria
Mosque a lady of grace, style and
charm invaded Pittsburgh. She
captured the audience with a wave of
her hand and a song from her heart.
That lady was Dionne Warwick.

Billed along with Warwick was the
Moments, a musical group. Instead
after a 15-minute delay comedian
Carl Fisher stepped onstage. He
explained that the Moments were in
a car accident in New Jersey and so
Fisher was the group’s replacement.
As the old saying goes ‘ ‘He tried but
he couldn’t do it.”

Fisher attempted warming up the
audience and it was like warming up
a TV dinner in the refrigerator. He
just didn’t go over well. He is
talented and as if to prove it he
bragged about playing the role of the
Lion on Broadway in the musical
show The Wiz. Forbearance is a
virtue some audiences possess and
Saturday night it was in abundance.
A couple of dozen of bad jokes later
and the surprisingly, small crowd
waited for the main attraction to
appear at last.

The orchestra assembled onstage
and began a sassy arrangement of
“Then Came You” and then
Warwick stepped-into the spotlight.
Dressed in a kimono jacket and
ﬂowing white pants she seemed to
typify the image of her entire
concert—cool and confortable.

Next in a set of Donna Summers’
“Love to Love You Baby” and Earth
Wind and Fire’s “You Can't Hide
Love” Warwick showed off her
versatility in the hits of today and
spotlighted her superb, full orches-
tra and female vocalists.

Between numbers Warwick made
the audience fell right at home with
her remarks on the selections, some
shop talk and quipped back to an
audience member who demanded to
hear ‘ ‘Kentucky Bluebird (Message
to Michael)’ ’—‘ ‘We're not gonna do

that one, we’re gonna do this one,"
and proceeded on with the show as
planned.

that her voice is still intact and all the

are still in shape.

After the medley,

was the only noticeable difference as
she sailed into the string accompani-
ment for the 24 million sellef“
“Feelings.” Warwick gave her all in
a moving rendition of Morris

highlight of the evening.

By now everyone was wondering

Finally Warwick ended the show '9

with a Disco medley including the
songs “Shining Star,” “That’s the
Way I Like It,” “Baby Face,” and
“The Hustle.” Warwick again
showed off her dancing abilities

tried to get the conductor/ arranger

to join in. This was a concert of pure @1-

enjoyment not soon to be forgotten.

When you attend a Panther
football game get ready to witness
a real spectacle, like the one you
may have seen at Saturday’s home
opener at Pitt Stadium against the
Temple Owls.

From defensive pursuit by
linebacker Jim Cramer and middle
guard Al Romano to the scrambling
and passing expertise of quarter-
back Matt Cavanaugh; from the
Long boots off Carson’s toe to the
grace of the Golden Girls and the
acrobatics of the cheerleaders;
from the lightening runs of Tony
Dorsett to the post-game chat of
opposing coaches Johnny Majors
and Wayne Hardin; to you, the
fans, who are lucky enough to have
this phenomenon of college football
unfold before you; a Saturday
afternoon in the fall can be an
enjoyable experience you won’t
soon forget.

Pitt News photo editor Rich
Wilson was on hand to capture a
few of those exciting moments.

Panthers Wary After 21-7 Win

BY STEVE SYBERT

With the betting world already
thrown into a frenzy with this
year’s sudden rash of upsets only
two weeks into the college football
season, it is clear that no team is
safe and could be upset by an
unranked or even hapless team on
any given Saturday.

And now the Pitt Panthers
realize this, but it took losses
Saturday by number-two ranked
Ohio State and Penn State, coupled
with a 21-7 scare from Temple at
Pitt Stadium to install this
awareness.

After convincing wins over Notre
Dame and Georgia Tech, the
Panthers wereundoubtedly not as

keyed up for the Temple contest as

they were for the previous two.
And why should they have been?
Pitt was heavily favored, as they
will be throughout much of the
season, and perhaps looking ahead
to Penn State,, over two months
away.

But now, coach Johnny Majors
and his troops have to be a little bit
weary and listen for those
footsteps.

“It’s still a win and I’m pleased
about that,” Majors said caut-
iously. “But we've got to keep
getting before we start concerning
ourselves with that 11th ball-
game.”

Perhaps the Panthers under-
estimated Temple. Though they
were riding a seven-game winning
streak, the Owls are hardly
considered a football power.

“I have the utmost respect for
(coach Wayne) Hardin and his
players,” Majors admitted. “They
did a heck of a job against us.

Temple did an amazing job with
their gameplan and preparation.

“I have a lot of respect for our
people too--the way they came out
in the second half with their backs
to the wall.”

The Panthers went into the
lockeroom down by a point, 7-6,
thanks to Carson Long’s two ﬁeld
goals which got them back into the
game after the unfortunate occur-
rence of a blocked punt.

After two possessions for each
team, in which neither could

muster much of an attack, Larry
Swider attempted to punt with 4:57
gone in the opening period and
Bruce Gordon, a freshman line-
backer, blew through the Pitt
protection to block the kick.
Teammate Chuck Gill scooped up’
the loose football at the Panther 15
and rambled into the end zone to
deliver a slight shock to the
number-three Pitt squad and many
of the 38,500 fans on hand hoping
to witness a massacre.

“I was really disappointed in
getting that punt blocked,” Majors
said. “A blocked punt can really
turn the game around.” The
frightful‘ event did not shake the
world, but did force the Panthers
into playing catchup.

The tables turned before the
quarter was out when safety Bob

Panther guards Tom Brzoza and Matt Carroll pry open Temple’s front
line for Elliott Walker [34]. Walker, who gained 41 yards in his first true
test of the season, plunged from one yard out for Pitt’s first of two

touchdowns.

Field Hockey Big Hit

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette ﬁeld hockey
team started off their first season
ever with a 4-0 shutout over
Fairmont, State on. Saturday.

Midtfiiy through the first half,
Pitt left inner Cindy DiGiacomo
scored the first point. The
Pantherettes led 1-0 at the end of
the half despite a hotly contested
goal by Fairmont that officials
ﬁnally ruled as scored after the
period had ended.

In the second half, Fairmont's
(1——9——l last season) loose defense
became even more porous, and
Pitt, capitalizing on a long pass,

quickly took charge. Centerfielder
Jayna Coury. DiGiacomo and right
inner Eileen Flaherty each added a
goal to bring the final score to 4-0.

‘‘I was very pleased," said Pitt
Coach Janet McDowell. ,‘In fact,
most of the players have never held
a stick before. They've only played
together two weeks and they really
worked nicely as a unit.”

“The thing I was afraid of was if
we couldn't last the whole game,"
DiGiacomo said. “It's a ‘lot of
running around out there."

The Pantherettes will get a
chance to challenge their begin-
ner’s luck when they travel to
Indiana Wednesday afternoon.

Jury, who injured his hand in the
game, but maintains he will be
ready for Duke, fell on a fumble at
the Temple 18-yard line and Pitt
was back in business. After Tony
Dorsett collected 13 of his 112
yards in the next two plays, Elliott
Walker fumbled to end a great
scoring opportunity for the Panp-
Panther

But Temple went nowhere in
their next series and punted the
ball over to Pitt, which took over at
the Temple 38. From there,
fullback Bobby Hutton and quarter-
back Matt Cavanugh each picked
up three yards, before Cavanaugh
overthrew split end Gordon Jones
at the Owls’ 25.

The stalled drive, however,

resulted in a 50-yard field goal, off 

the foot of long, to cut the Temple
margin to 7-3 with 13:23 remaining
in the first half.

Though Temple looked shoddy
running the veer, as did the
Panthers, the Owls managed to
grind out first downs, mostly on
third down plays. But with 11
minutes left on the clock, middle
guard Al Romano and defensive
tackle Randy Hollowa pressured
Temple quarterback Pat Carey and
caused him to fumble.

Defensive end Ed Wilamowski
recovered this one, yet the
Panthers again failed to capitalize
and had to‘settle for another Long

three-pointer, this time from 33 ‘

yards out.

Majors refused to comment on
exactly’ what he said to the
Panthers between halves, following
their very lackluster performance,
but it worked, as a different team
came back onto the field for the
ﬁnal 30 minutes.

“In the second half we came out
inspired, even the bench was,”

Tony Dorsett, who ran for 112 yards In 23 carries against Temple at Pitt
Stadium on Saturday, sliced his way through a line of would-he tacklers to

reach the goal line in the fourth
touchdowninthe2l'-7,contest.
Majors said. “And we decided to
throw more in the second half
because we were behind.”

The Panthers went right to work
and compiled an 82-yard scoring
drive to take the lead for good.
Walker and Dorsett took the ball
five times and picked up 23 yards
and two first downs. Walker raced
for ten yards, got free in the
Temple secondary and almost
broke one for touchdown.

After tight end Jim Corbett made
a great grab over the middle for 11
yards and another? first down
Walker picked up 15 more to the
34-yard line of Temple. Three

quarter for the Panthers second
Wilson photo

plays later, Walker hit, off center
for one yard and the touchdown.
Dorsett took a pitch and ran around
left end to add the two-point
conversion and give Pitt a 14-7
lead.

“Cavanaugh came back much
crisper in the second half,” Majors
said of the team's resurgence.
“He made some key throws and
ran some key keepers. I was
pleased with the comeback of the
offense overall.”

Cavanaugh, who overthrew most
of his receivers in the first half,
completing only two of seven

Boaters Chip Rock, 2- l

BY JIM LEWIS

If Mr. Guinness was at Pitt
Stadium Friday night, he would have
been in ecstacy.

It was a night of firsts for the Pitt
soccer team, which shocked power-
ful Slippery Rock with a fantastic 2-1
victory—-the first time the Panthers
have beaten the Rockets in ten years.

Why was it a fantastic win?
Because a Pitt victory was just not to
be predicted. Always a state
strongman, the Rock boasted a
veteran team with forwards Art Rex
and Kamal Houari, two players
who’ve scored more goals in one
season than an entire Pitt team for
the past four years.

Meanwhile, Pitt possessed a
young, inexperienced squad, with a
losing record, that was trying to
find just how good it was.

Considering that the Rock had a
two-year record of 31-5, including
numberous NAIA playoff appear-
ances, you can see why the Panthers
weren’t exactly favored.

And things weren’t exactly
looking well. Slippery Rock was
controlling the ball early in the first
half and, although Pitt had the only
serious shot on goal. The Rockets
were pressuring, that is, until the
Pitt offense did something they were
very seldom able to do in the
past-—score on a golden opportun-
itv.

Freshman Todd Wawrousek’s
corner kick was deﬂected in front by

the Rocket goalie and right to Pitt’s
Mark Nigh, who moved in and
blasted a bullet into the center of the
net. It’ was Nigh’s first
regular-season goal, while Waw-
rousek, credited with an assist,
obtained his first point as a Panther.

“It was great,” an exhuberant

Wawrousek said of his assist.

“That’s all I can say. We beat the
Rock.”

_ But at the end of the first half, it
didn t look like there would be a Pitt
post-game victory party.

Already denied a goal when the
officials called a penalty after
Slippery Rock supposedly scored,
the Rockets came back with about 20
seconds left in the half. A pass found
its way to a Rock player who put it
past helpless Pitt Goalie Frank
Bucci. At halftime, the game wa
tied, 1-1. .

With that quick goal, it again
looked as if Slippery Rock would use

its veteran experience to eek out a
win.

But Pitt answered opportunity’s
knock a second time.

A head pass by Erwin Siege] to

. freshman Rick Roccon alone in front

produced the game-winner, 2-1. It
was Siegel’s first point of the year
and Roccon’s ﬁrst goal as a Panther.

“It was pretty super,” Roccon
said of his first college career goal.
“I’m glad it came at a good time.”

A very good time; not only did it
raise Pitt’ s record to an even 2-2, but
it afso raised questions of playoff
hopes for the Panthers.

Mark Nigh quenched those hopes.

‘ “We’re not thinking playoffs
right now,” Nigh answered quickly.

«surprisingly

‘ ‘We’1'eJ'USt playing each game as it
comes, thinking for a win.”

_ But the win did point the Panthers
in the right direction. Not only did
the offense learn it can score in touch
situation, but the defense was
assured it could match last year’s
stubborn crew—the same crew that

also held Slippery Rock to one
measley goal in a 1-0 loss.

So the question is what made the
difference this year?

“Randy Gyory and Jedd Zaring
made the difference,” coach Leo
Bemis said proudly.

Indeed, Gyory, a forward, and
Zaring, a back, were prime
examples of what has made this an
interesting season so far--young,
new-foundtalent. _Both sophomores
were impressive, especially after the
Panther scored their second goal and
faced unbearable pressure by the
Rock. They were all over the field,
blocking shots and executing
impressive clearing passes out of
their zone. -

The win was so big, it created a
ﬁnal first—an obviously overjoyed
Bemis. Bemis is an excitable coach,
but after Friday’s match he was
unusually overwhelmed.

“Did we want it! "’ Bemis cried as
the final second ticked away. Then
pulling his cautious self together, he
said, “This team is growing. This
win gave us a lot of conﬁdence.”

Enough confidence of beat
tough Carnegie-
_Mellon Wednesday at Pitt Stad-
ium? '

Well. if Pitt does beat the
Tartans. it won't be the first time
this season the Panthers will have
beaten a veteran squad.

Outclassed Owls Tough

BY RON SIEGEL

It was a sign of things to come.
Their 21-7 victory over Temple
Saturday showed the Panthers that
what opponents lack in ability will
be made up for by super-psych,
trick.plays and who knows what
else.

Though outclassed on paper,
Temple gave Pitt grief all afternoon
and the low margin of victory left a
great deal of speculation on where
the Panthers will be in the polls this
week. With Ohio State losing to
Missouri, Pitt would have easily
moved into the number-two spot
with a convincing victory. As it
stands, they could by ranked
anywhere from two to ﬁfth.

Typical  the next six oppo-
nents on the Pitt schedule, Temple
shouldn’t have been in the game at
halftime. Instead, they carried a
7-6 lead into the locker room.

The fact that Tony Dorsett
missed much of the ﬁrst half was a
big factor. It also wasn’t much of a
surprise. In three games against
Temple in his career, Dorsett has
been injured twice. When he
scores against them, Dorsett “hot
dogs" it, something uncharacteris-
tic for him. He usually tosses the
ball in an Owl's face.

This is not typical of Heisman
Trophy candidates. Although used
to having teams keyed up to get
him, Dorsett sees Temple as going
beyond that.

“Temple is not a dirty ball
club,” he said in the training room
after the game while nursing his
badlv bruised left calf. ‘But I think
they could be a better ball club if
they played with some character.

  

I

iof

They play good football, but some

the things they do are
absolutely not necessary.”
That was a pretty harsh

statement from a Heisman candi-
date who didn’t want to alienate
the Philadelphia writers (and
possible voters) gathered around
him.

Temple also showed some other
things new to the Panthers. On
obvious punting situations, the
Owls would not have a huddle, but
instead lined up right away. With
Pitt’s regular defensive unit in, the
punter and blocking specialists
would charge on, in time to get a
snap off, but not in time for Pitt to
get in its specialists.

The maneuver ruined Pitt’s punt
returning, and also gave Temple a
first down when the Panthers had
18 men on the field for one play.

“That was a very clever

maneuver,” said Pitt head coach-
Johnny Majors. “I didn’t think it

was clever in the ball game,
though. We'll be better prepared
for it next time. It was the ﬁrst
time in my memory that I‘ve ever
come_across that.”

Considered one of the trickiest
coaches in college football, Temple
coach Wayne Hardin is familiar to
Pitt followers. While coaching
Navy many years ago, one of
Hardin’s players feigned injury and
began limping off the field as the
Midshipmen broke their huddle.
When the ball was snapped, he
made an amazing recovery, catch-
ing the game-winning touchdown
pass.

Hardin pulled another interest-
ing move in the fourth quarter.

‘OZ

*Dial-direct calls are those lntra—U.S.
phone without operator assistanc

Trailing by 14 points early in the
fourth quarter, Hardin forsook
trying to win the game by keeping
the ball on the ground. He
apparently decided that losing 21-7
was better than taking a chance on
winning.

That may not have been such a
bad idea, in view of the fct that the
Pitt defense shut out Temple (thi-
Owl's only score came on a blocked
punt).

For the Panthers, it was a.

valuable lesson, though fortunately
not a costly one. What the_weaker
teams lack in ability, they make up_
for by going all out to knock off the
high-ranked Panthers. As Pitt
climbs in the ratings, it will just
mean that much more for the “little
guys" to beat the Panthers.

passes, regained his accuracy to
complete ﬁve of seven in the
second half, many to his favorite
receive, the sure-handed Corbett.

After Jury intercepted a Care
pass near the end of the third
quarter, Pitt drove to the Temple
three-yard line, where Dorsett took
a pitch from Cavanaugh and sliced
into the end zone at the 1:03 mark
of the ﬁnal period.

The key plays were a 20-yard
pass from Cavanaugh to Corbett
and a personal foul call against
Temple which moved the ball from

the 25-yard line to the 12.

The women's cross-country
team, coached by Alfreda Goff and
Mary Ellen Shea, placed seventh as
a team in yesterday’s Lady Lion
Invitational at Penn State.

Becky Falck led the Pantherettes
with a ninth-place run over the
damp, three-mile, 50-yard course
in 18:11. Pitt’s next-best time was
turned in by Brenda Chorpenning,
while Maria Sciulla, Karen Cerutti
and Sue Miller completed the
scoring _for Pitt.

Consisting of four freshmen and
a senior (Cerutti), the young team's
efforts have pleased Coach Goff,
“This week's competition was

“We had a sluggish start,”
Majors commented to the repor-

but it was a win. A ﬁne football

“I'm happy with the win,
