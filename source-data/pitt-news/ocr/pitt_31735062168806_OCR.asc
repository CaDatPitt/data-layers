Sociologist Says —

C College

by DAVID L. AIKEN

CHICAGO, Ill. (CPS) — Stu-
dents most likely to be active in
student protests are those whose
parents raised them permissive-
ly, and who have the affluence to
ignore conventional worries about
jobs and status, according to a
recent study by a University of
Chicago sociologist.

In a study of “the roots of
student protest,” Richard Flacks,
assistant professor of sociology,
writes, “It seems plausible that
this is the ﬁrst generation in
which a substantial number of
youth have both the impulse to
free themselves from convention-
al status concerns and can af-
ford to do so.”

Flacks proposed as an hypo-
thesis that students today are
active in protest because:

>They ﬁnd student life high-
ly “rationalized,” which is re-
lated to impersonality and com-
petitiveness. I

> They have been reared in
permissive, democratic families,
which place high values on stan-
dards other than high status and
achievement. s

> These values make it ‘more
difficult for students to submit
to adult authority, respect status
distinctions, and accept the pre-
vailing rationalized, competitive
system.

> Since they are “not oriented
to the (prevailing) norms of
achievement,” they feel less need
to accept conformity to “get
ahead.” Moreover, they can af-
ford to be non-conformist%“af-
ﬂuence has freed them, at least
for a period of time, from some
of the anxieties and preoccupa-
tions which have been the deﬁn-
ing features of American middle-
class social character.”

> They spend a long period in
a university environment which,
with a series of events around
1960 including Southern sit-ins
and the demonstrationsiagainst
HUAC, has changed from an at-
mosphere of “cool” non-commit-
ment to concern with direct ac-
tion. “A full understanding of
the dynamics of the movement
requires a -‘collective behavior’
approach,” Flacks comments.

> Finally, the formerly disor-
ganized “bohemian” forms of de-
viance have become translated,
through the liberal-minded par-
ents, into a “developing cultural
tradition” into which the acti-
vists students are socialized. A
second generation of radicals is
reaching adulthood, born of the
radicals of the thirties, Flacks
pointed out.

Attempting to discover why the
current crop of college students
has developed such a strong pro-
test movement, while students of
the ﬁfties were noted for apathy,
Flacks organized a study of the
family backgrounds, political be-
liefs, and values of students ac-
tive in such movements.

In one ‘part of his research, he

  
    
    
    
   
  

Protesters Permissively Raised I

sent a crew of interviewers to
talk with parents of students who
live in the Chicago area who
were listed as participating in
national protest groups, such as
SDS, SNCC, or peace groups. The
students attended 26 different col-
leges around the country.

Parents were asked about their
own political attitudes, what
kinds of values they held most
strongly,_and how they had raised
their children. The students them-
selves were also asked for their
views on their parents.

A group of “non-activists” sim-
ilar in such factors as economic

- status to the activists was also

interviewed as a control.

For a second study, Flacks
seized the opportunity oﬁered by
the spring sit-in at UC’s admin-
istration building. Students from
his course in Collective Behavior
interviewed 65 of___those who had
sat in; 35 of those who had sign-
ed a petition opposing the sit-in;
and all students living on one
ﬂoor" of Pierce Tower and one
ﬂoor of New Dorms.

According to Flacks, the most
striking results of these studies
are:

> Student activists differ in
terms of values and attitudes
from non-activists to a high de-
gree.

He attributes the uniformity
among activists to the effects of
a subculture reﬁecting their
share perspectives, not simply to
“common personality traits or
social origins.”

> Parents of activists also “de-
viate from ‘conventional middle-
class’ values and attitudes,” to a
marked degree.

> The difference of values be-
tween students can be directly
traced to different values of their
parents, Flacks believes. He con-
tradicts “a frequently expressed
stereotype of activist students as
‘rebels’ against parental author-
ity.”

>Activists are not ideologues.
While they are “militant, com-
mitted, and ‘radical’ with respect
to particular issues, they are not
committed to overarching ideo-
logical positions.”

This point is reﬂected .“mo"st

dramatically in their unwilling--

ness to describe themselves as
‘socialist’ or to endorse explicit-
ly socialist policies,” Flack re-
ports.

In demographic terms, Flacks
found that activists are likely to
be from high-income, well-edu-
cated, professional families from
urban areas. Activists are also
disproportionately Jewish, and
tend to come from recent immi-
grant stock, his study found.

Only about one-third of the
activists in the large sample of
Chicago—area students, however,
said their political position was
“socialist,” while more than half
said they were “highly liberal.”

Those in the “non-activist” con-
trol group were predominately
in the “moderately liberal”,class

‘ (43 per cent), with almost three

out of ten in the “moderately
conservative” group, and two-
tenths calling themselves “high-
ly liberal.”

While all students reported
opinions more liberal than those
of their parents, there was a sig-
niﬁcant gap between the parents
of activists and those of ‘non-
activists.

Clearly, -student activists are
likely to come from liberal, po-
litically active families.

They are also likely to come
from families in which “permis-
sive,” “democratic” child—rearing
practices are used, as shown by
the parents’ own reports.

The homes of activists were also
those in which Values other than
material wealth are fostered.
These differences in values and
aspirations were paralleled in the
interviews with parents of acti-
vists and non-activists.

Flack rated students on four
“values patterns”:

> Activists are high in roman-
ticism,” which he deﬁned as “sen-
sitivity to beauty,” and, more
broadly, “explicit concern. with
. . feeling and passion, imme-

diate and inner experience.”

> They are also high in “intel-
lectualism,” concern with ideas.

> “Humanitarianism” is also
a trait of activists, who are “con-
cerned with the plight of others”
and place high value on egalitari-
anism.

set of external inﬂexible rules to
govern ‘moral behavior.”

   Pass-Fail Option: A Rational

. , Too often in past years major university policy changes have been
. made in the absence of student opinion. During the past year strides have
. - been to change this pattern and one sign of change is the new pass-fail
3}-option suggested for the School of Liberal Arts. This purposeful and ra-
tional proposal for liberalizing a student’s choice of curriculum was formu-
- la.ted through the joint efforts of student and administrators. . —
. Under the new option upperclassmen (with more than 64 credits)
V would be able to take‘ a maximum of six credits for which he would not
receive a letter grade but rather a pass or fail grade. The proposal limits
X courses taken on this basis to those not in a student’s‘ major‘ or related-
. I ﬁelds. The course credits would be counted towards graduation, butwould
not be figured in the quality point average (Q.P.A.) of the students.

The advantages of this system are obvious. The option permits liberal
arts students to experiment with in areas they are interested in yet in
which they have limited backgrounds. The English major with a French
 minor might be quicker to try out a physics course if he realizes his Q.P.A.

The Large Obstacles

Students 81 Decision Making

The Collegiate Press Service I

THREE MAJOR educa-

tional organizations issued a
qualiﬁedwcall this week for
student participation in col-
lege and university policy-
making.

Despite “large obstacles”
to such involvement, the
groups said that colleges
should seek ways to “permit
signiﬁcant student participa-
tion within the limits of at-

- tainable effectiveness.” .

These suggestions were
containedin a short note on
students as part of a state-

_ ment issued by the Ameri-

can Association of Universi-
ty Professors, the American

- Council on Education, and

the Associationof Governing
Boards of Colleges and Uni-
versities. The full statement,

in preparation since 1964,

primarily discussed the re-
sponsibilities of trustees,
presidents, and faculty for

' “Government of Colleges and

Universities.” No main sec-
tion was offered on students.

THE OBSTACLES to stu-
dent participation on policy-
making, the statement said,
include “inexperience, un-
test capacity, transitory sta-
tus . . . and the inescapable
fact that the other compon-

ents of the. institution are in,

a position of judgment over
the students.”

The report added, however,
that the following opportun-
ities should be given to in-
crease students “respect”
for their colleges and univer-
sities:

'> Freedom of speech in

__ the classroom “without fear

of institutional reprisal ;

_ > Freedom to discuss
questions of institutional po-

' licy and operation;

>The right to academic
due process when charged

stitutional regulations; and

> The same right to hear
speakers of their own choice
as is enjoyed by other com-
ponents of the institution.”

THE EDUCATIONAL or-

‘ ganizations avoided issuing a «

main section on students,

however, because, they said, .

an attempt to deﬁne stu-
dents’ at a time when it is
rapidly changing, might hurt
student interest and because
“students do not at present
have a signiﬁcant voice in
the government of colleges
and universities.”

“It would be unseemly to
obscure, by superﬁcial equal-
ity of length -of statement,”
the report said, “what may
be a serious lag entitled to
separate and confrontation.”

In the major part of the
statement, the groups sug-
gested ways in which trus-
tees, presidents, and faculty
can share responsibility for
governing institutions. They
urge colleges to establish
‘.‘i'easonably explicit” state-
ments of general educational
policy and clear deﬁnitions
of operating responsibility
and authority in official reg-
ulations.

TRUSTEES, THE report
said, have ﬁnal institutional
authority in almost all-col-
leges_ and universities, with
few exceptions. Theyshould,
however, delegate many of
their responsibilities, and
concentrate on long—term

won’t take a dive as a result. Computer Science I -is a good example of a
course which many Liberal Arts students would like to sign up for but
hesitate to because of its difficulty. ' I ’

Another good p-oint of the option is that\_instructors would not know
which, if any, of the students in his classes are taking the class on the
pass-fail basis. At the end of the term the Student Records Office will
simply give the student a “P” (pass) on his grade sheet if his grade is “D”
or above. This way instructors could never setup a separate grading sys-
tem for pass-fail students. R . 4

Further once a student has elected a course on a pass-fail basis, he
cannot change to receive letter grade credit on his Q.P.A.

One of the ‘most gratifying parts of the_ entire formulation of the _3
option is that it was initiated by the Liberal Arts Cabinet which is an arm R
of the Student Government. It was the Cabinet that approached Liberal
Arts Dean, D1‘. James A. Kehl, and got the passage of the option under

planning, on raising capital
and operating funds, and on
overseeing personnel policy.

The president, the report
said, “is measured largely
by his capacity for institu- '
tional leadership.” As chief
executive‘ and planning offi-
cer he ,must maintain com-
munications within the in-
stitution and between the
school and its public; and he I
must “innovate and initiate.”

Faculty members should
have the major responsibil-
'ity for curriculum, student
instruction, decisions on ten-
ure, promotion, and dismis-
sals, and policies governing
salary increases, the report L “j
added. It warned that exter— '
nal restraints on faculty re-
sponsibility for education of
students can impair the “ed-
ucation effectiveness” of an
institution. '

THE STATE.MENT\was_
worked out by the three ed-
ucational organizations “with
a great deal of evolution” in
their views, said Louis
Joughin, associate secretary
of the AAUP. “I think it i
will be unpalatable to only ‘V
a few extreme views.”

- “It won’t satisfy those stu-
dents who think -of a college
as ‘a battleground for test-
ing the administration for
the show they want to put
on the road. Some trustees
will think too much power
was given to other groups,
and some presidents will ob-
ject to it,” he added.

Eligible students who intend to
take-this test should apply at
once to the nearest’ Selective
Service local board for an Ap-

_ plication Card and a Bulletin of
‘ Information for.the test. _

Following instructions in "the
Bulletin, the student should ﬁll
out his application and mail it
immediately in the envelope pro-
vided to Selective Service Exam-
ining Section, Educational Test-
ing Service, P.O. Box 988, Prince-
ton, N. J. 08540. To ensure pro-
cessing, applications must be

ing Service, which prepares and
administers the College Quali-
ﬁcation Test for the Selective
Service System, it will be greatly
to the student’s advantage to ﬁle
his application at once. By reg-
istering early, he stands the best
chance of being assigned to the
test center he has chosen. Be-
cause of the possibility that he
may be assigned to any of the

_testing dates, it is very impor-
tant he list a center and center
number for every date on which.

/ Credit Hour System

EAST ORANGE, N.J. -
(I.P.)——The new Upsala Col-
lege catalogue will include a
number of changes regard-
ing courses, academic stand-
ing, and extra-curricular pol-

icy. ‘

One change will be the aboli-
 tion of course credits. Starting
"' next September, students‘ will be
required to take a total of 40
courses in order to ‘graduate but
no credit hour values will be
assigned to the course. Students
will still receive quality points
for the courses which they take—
one point for a C, two for a B_,
three for an  none for a D, and
minus one for an F.

V The faculty approved the new
system last May. According to
Edward Lawson, director of aca-
demic counseling, both her and
the faculty are “very much in
favor” of the new system. Mr.
Lawson says that eliminating
2,, credits will cut down the margin

~:

of quality points, will help to de-
emphasize the importance of
quality points and grades, and

Swill equalize the attitudes to-

wards courses.

He notes’ that the person who
may "be harmed by the new sys-
tem is one who is good in sci-

. ence courses, which are some-

times four credits, and poor in
humanities courses, which are us-
usually three credits. The only
two-credit courses now given at
Upsala are several education
courses which are usually taken
during senior year. Mr. Lawson

says that these courses will be

combined so that they are equal,

to other courses.

Another change of policy ‘will
be the reporting of a single hon.-
ors list, rather than one divided
into three levels of honors. Now,‘
any student with an average for
the semester of 2.20 or better
and with no grade lower than a

  Ithaca College Begins

 - ‘Dial-a-Course’Program

ITHACA, N. Y. (IP) — Dial-a-
course is now possible at Ithaca
College, where a student is able
' ,_ to listen to the classroom lecture
he missed. “Dial-a-course” is the
name that students have given to
a plan just instituted here under
.which class meetings are record-
ed on audio tape, with later re-
play for the beneﬁt of students
who may wish to hear them.
These students are expected to
include those who were unable
to attend the class.-meeting be-
-_cause of illness, conflict of sched-
ule‘s or for other reasons and
students who did . . . attend but
wish to hear it again. A student
may hear the replay of the lee-
tures by donning earphones at
a number of places on the cam-
pus, dialing the communications
center and asking by number for
the course he desires.
It is possible for a number of
students—up to 600-i-to listen
simultaneously with earphones or
over loudspeakers. Groups may
gather in "a number of seminar-
rooms, dial the course, and lis-
ten to them over loudspeakers. If
, ,al student is ill and conﬁned to a
1 - ‘ward in the inﬁrmary, he or she
‘ may hear a lecture either way—
by wearing earphones, or receiv-
 ing over the loudspeaker. In the
' latter case, all the students in
_  the ward must agree to the course
 meeting they wish to hear.

The plan is intended to strength-

s en the instructional programs at

the college and to protect the

investment that the student and

his family have made in his edu-
cation.

Ohio’s Miami U.Votes

To Retain Trimester =

OXFORD, Ohio (IP) — Miami
University’s faculty recently re-
sponded to Chancellor John D.
Millett’s proposal to put all state-
assisted universities on the quar-
ter system by voting preference
for continuing it.s test of the tri-
mester system for two more
years. ' A

At the same time, it indicated
plans to seek ways of making its
trimester calendar more compati-
ble with quarter systems of other
institutions during’ such a test.

By a solid vote, the Miami
University Senate affirmed a Fac-
ulty Council vote “that the Sen-6’
ate of Miami University prefers
to continue theexperirnent be-
gun in September, 1965, known
as the Trimester Calendar,
though the 1967-69 biennium, in-
asmuch as experience to date is
insufficient to warrant termina-
tion of this experiment.

The Senate action included ap-
proval of a proposal that “such
changes within the trimester cal-
endar as may seem presently de-
sirable be proposed in'time for
implementation in 1966-67 and at

‘later times, and thata trimester

evaluation c 0 in mi t t e e operate
with the view of making a ‘ﬁnal’
report to the Faculty,‘ Council
(and thereby, to the Senate) in
time for informed action in the
fall of 1968.”

The committee’s study and re-
port _are to include evaluation of
academic experience, both fac-

’ ulty and student; ﬁnancial exper-

ience, including base salary and

.extra—term stipend; plant utiliza-

tion experience, student transfer
experience and legislative ﬁnan-
cial support. ,

The Faculty Council and its-
evaluation committee now are
asked by the Senate to consider

monds to fit your budget.

Terms arranged.

schedule changes in the third
(summer) trimester for 1968
which would make the trimester
calendar more compatible with
the quarter system of other
schools.

The Senate referred back to
the Faculty Council for further
consideration a “credit-no credit”
plan, previously approved by the
council. This would permit an
upperclassman to enroll for cred-
it, but no grade, in a course which
he might be reluctant -to explore
lost it jeopardize a grade aver-
age required for graduate or pro-
fessional school. The plan in-
cludes understanding that failure
would mean no grade as well as
no credit. _ W

Commenting on the Millett
memo, Miami President Phillip
R. Shriver said: “Chancellor Mil-
let and I have discussed the pos-
sibility that the trimester calen-
dar and the quarter calendar can
be made to Work well alongside
each other. He has indicated that
he is willing to try this out. In
turn, I have assured him that we
shall do all we can to make our
trimester calendar for. 1967-68
compatiblewith the quarter cal-
endars of the other state univer-

.sities. One way we might do this ‘

would be to change the third tri-
mester of 19167 from two seven
and one-half-week terms to three
ﬁve-week terms, ‘starting in late
April, mid-June and mid-July.”

“Business is for

the birds!”

Who says so?

Lots of people do. Some right on your
campus. And for rationale, they point an
accusing ﬁnger at business and say it lacks
“social commitment.”

Social commitment? We wish they could
visit our Keamy, N. J. plant, where we
make cable and apparatus for your Bell
telephone company. But we have time for
other thoughts, other talents.

Like the situation in nearby Newark.

With civic and business leaders, we be-
gan buzzing with ideas. “Let’s teach higher

skills to some of the un-employed and,

under-employed. Say, machine shop prac-

\ tice. They could qualify for jobs that are
going begging——and help themselves as‘

well.”
We lent our tool-and-die shop, eve-

nings. We found volunteer instructors. A ,

community group screened applicants.
Another supplied hand tools‘. The Boys

Club donated classroom facilities. Another
company sent more instructors.

Some 70 trainees enrolled. Their incen-
tive? Self-improvement. Results to date?
New people at better jobs. Happier.

And this is only one of dozens of social-
minded projects at Western Electric plants
across the country, where our first job is
making communications equipment for the
Bell System.

So, you don’t give up ideals when you
graduate. If anything, at a company like,
say, Western Electric, you add to them.
And It’s not just a theory. It’s practice.
Satisfying. Come on and find out.,And
watch a feathered cliche ﬂy out the window.

SENTRY _ INSURANCE

_ The Hardware lvlutuals Organization

Two ﬁeld house records,
two pulled muscles and no
pole vaulters: these three
factors combined for the
track team’s 58-42 loss to
Kent State on Saturday.

The Golden Flashes were just
too strong in the distance events
and too lucky in the clutch for
coach Jim Banner’s runners.

In all, Saturday’s meet saw
four records broken. Paul Zink

set a new freshman mark in the '

mile of 4:223. This beat Frank
Handelman’s old record by ex-
actly two seconds. Kent’s Pete
Lorrando slashed 18 seconds off
the old Field House mark for the
two mile. Lorrando breezed to a
9:06.4 time running against al-
most no competition.

Handelman himself set a new
varsity mile record. He out three-
tenths of a second off the two-
year-old 41:17.3 time. Unfortunate-
ly, Handelman ﬁnished the race
almost ten seconds behind Kent’s
Sam Bair.

companys

  'i"’.,T,kn.owitﬁiéy

Bair has to be one of the most
impressive athletes ever to run
in Fitzerald Field House. He re-
minds you of Tom O’Hara be-
cause he’s small, thin, and sets
records.

On Saturday, Bair smashed his
own Field House record with a
4:07.6 mile. Later, in the 1,000-
yard run, he shot past Ken Law-
ton half way through the gun
lap, then coasted in for an easy
victory. He’s only a junior.

The pulled muscles belong to
Kingman Davis and Carl Wooten.
Davis and Jack Neyer took early
leads in the 600-yard run. But
200-yards into the last lap, Da-
vis began to limp and dropped
back. Neyer took over and was
timed in the same tenth of a
second of Kent’s Curt Raymond.
Raymond had him by an inch at
the tape, however, and came up
with the win. Somehow, Davis
fought back to a third place ﬁn.
ish.

Wooten was stricken in the
mile relay. Leadoff runner Neyer

opened a ﬁve-yard lead, Davis
doubled it, then Tom Christie
added his own ten yards as he
handed off to Wooten for the
anchor leg. At the very begin-
ning of the gun lap, Kent’s Oran
Richberg was gaining and an
exciting race developed.

But just as the gun signaling
the last lap went oﬁf, Wooten
dropped to the track as if he had
been shot. Richberg coasted
through the lap alone, as Wooten
was helped down to the locker
room.

Banner’s runners made a bet-
ter showing in the shorter events.
Richberg won the 60-yard dash,
but Chet Wojciechowski and
Doug Doben were close second
and third place ﬁnishers. Chris-
tie and Dave Brinn took an easy
one-two victory in the hurdles.
Earlier, Christie had won the
broad jump.

That ﬁeld event was the only
successful one fo-r the losers. The
one‘-two-three sweep in the broad
jump was all but nulliﬁed by the

forfiet of the pole vault event.
Otherwise, John Farthing
aged a second place in the high
jump and Greg Ellis took third
in the shot put.

111 an -

Banner’s two—mile relay team
of Handelman, Larry Hubner,
Lawton and Roger Holly per-
formed as expected in a 200-yard,
26 second Victory over the Kent
foursome.

The freshman had a worse
time than the Varsity. Outnum-
bered in every event they enter-
ed, their 57-28 loss was expected.
The only event where they had
as many runners as Kent was in
the mile relay, which they won.

St. John’s Covers Spot,
Tops Panthers, 95-66

by JAY ROSENSTEIN, assistant sports Editor
Virginia Tech’s 9-3 basketball team visits the Field
House tonight to play the cagers with tipoff at 8:15. The
Gobblers are smarting from a 70-68 defeat handed them by

Clemson at home Saturday.

The cagers weren’t exactly surprised in the same way
by St. Johns’ in New York Saturday night. They were ex-

pected to lose, according to the
betting line, by 28 points. The
Panthers gave the Redmen a
small scare, then were routed,
95-66.

It didn’t start out as a run-
away, however. The cagers play-
ed a tight zone defense in the
ﬁrst half that completely throt-
tled the Johnnies’ inside men.
All-American candidate S on n y
Dove was held to one ﬁeld goal
before halftime.

“We played a good ﬁrst half,”
said Panther coach Bob Tim-
mons. “We held Dove to a cou-
ple of points and controlled the
backboards by laying back in our
zone. .We let their guards try to
work the ball inside.”

Timmons’ strategy worked as
long as St. John’s shot poorly

JIM LavALLI-zit
Pantlwrs’ Top Scorer

from outside. Once the Redmen
guards started to ﬁnd the range,
however, it opened up the eager
defense and allowed Dove to
score from in close.

This is what happened in the
second half. Richie Jackson, a
sophomore substitute, came off
the St. John’s bench to hit ﬁve
straight jump shots and score
the game’s high of 18 points.

“When they started to connect
from outside,” Timmons explain-
ed, “we had to go out after them.
That broke the game wide open.”
The cagers had trailed by only
seven, 36-29, at the half.

Dove scored 14 points in the
second half but still was held to
his lowest output of the season.
The cagers also outrebounded the
Redmen, 54-46, as Jim LaValley
played his third creditable game
in a row.

The Panther center grabbed 15
rebounds and tallied 14 points.
“Jim played another ﬁne game
for us,” Timmons said. “If we
hadn’t shot so poorly (25 of 82),
we would have stayed in the
game longer.”  E  E E I ~

Timmons was, however, pleased
with his bench. The return of
Stan Falenski to the squad after
an indeﬁnite suspension helped
considerably. ‘.€Stan played about
half the ball game and had 14
points,” Timmons pointed out.
“With him and Ken Bollens
(eight points) in the game, it
gave me a chance to rest our
starters.”

“We didn’t hurt ourselves when
they were in there,” Timmons
continued, “I think we’ll be a
little more presentable now.”

The ﬁrst test of presentability
is tonight. Virginia Tech romp-
ed over the cagers last year, 100-
74, in Blacksburg. Two years
ago, VPI lost to the Panthers, 74-
69, in the Steel Bo-wl.

Ron Perry remains from that
sophomore-ladden Steel Bowl
squad. The 6’3” guard is averag-
ing better than 16 points a game
for the Gobblers. “We saw him
against Duke at the beginning of
the season,” remembers Tim-
mons. “He gave them ﬁts.” VPI
upended Duke, 85-71, in Dur-
ham.

GLEN COMBS is Virginia Tech’s leading. point-
getter, averaging over 22 a game. The 6-2, 180 lb.
guard, although only a junior, has sparked VPI to
a 9-3 record despite the loss of 6-11 Bob King at the

beginning of the .season. As a sophomore, Combs
scored 24 points for the Gobblers against Temple in
last year’s NIT. A native Kentuckian, Combs must
have been overlooked by Adolph Rupp.

 Along wit1§v..Perry in the Gob-
bler backcourt is Glen Combs.
Only a junior, Combs leads a
Well-balanced VPI scoring attack
with 22 points a game. Ted Ware,
another junior, averages 13 points
while hitting nearly 60 per cent
of his shots.

Before being upset by Clem-
son, VPI had lost onlyon the
road to Wake Forest in overtime,
and to a highly-regarded Florida
team.

Youngstown could manage, and,

won it on the boards. Aside from
the rebounding we played real
well only in spurts.”

The spurts were enough, “how- 1

College ‘ Paper Claims

Dorm Women Victims

Of Childish Treatment

(ACP)—Coeds living in dormitories have long been vic-
tims of an hours policy which treats them as immature
children who cannot be expected to use their time responsi-
bly, comments the University of Minnesota Daily.

They are denied the rights of coeds living off campus
and working girls in this age group to do whatever they
wish with their time. The.Daily continued:

In all fairness to the administration and to Dean» of Stu-

dents E. G. Williamson it must be pointed out that womens
hours at the University of Minnesota ‘are more liberal than at most
large universities and certainly more liberal than at most smaller

‘colleges. -

And the trend at the university is toward even less restrictive
rules. Since 1960 there have ‘been no restrictions on women over 21
and recently Williamson approved a policy granting junior and senior
women in three dormitories permission to regulate their own hours.

But the “stifling paternalism” (a phrase coined by Williamson) of
the university toward women dormitory residents will not cease until
all women’s hours are abolished.’ _ '

There is no evidence indicating that coeds will suddenly become
irresponsible if they are granted freedom. At Comstock Hall, for
example, junior and senior women use the no-hours policy an average
of only twice a month. .

And current policies, ironically enough, do not prevent a girl from
staying out late if she really wants to. Instead of returning and risking
a penalty, she simply stays out all night. i -

University officials are worried about public reaction to a no-

hours policy, especially if it is granted to freshmen. The public is “not
quite ready for the shock” of giving total freedom to freshmen, Wil-
liamson said last year. “There’s still a little protectiveness in our
culture.” .

Yes, there might be some adverse public reaction if all women’s

hours are eliminated, .but hardly as much as administrators fear. The

public has shown itself to be remarkably tolerant in (bther controversial
matters. Besides, the university should take the lead in correcting
society’s weaknesses—overprotectiveness certainly is a weakness-—and
educate the public on them. We hope the administration will seriously
consider the abolition of women’s hours this year.

WPGH Extends Its Service  

To Offer Nes Inviews  

by BERNIE McLEOD

“WPGH has always been
good at playing and dedicat-
ing songs,” said David Eh-
renwerth, campus news di-
rector of WPGH, the Uni-
versity radio station. “Our
problem was we needed to offer
more news. Last year we started
using UPI, the world news tele-

type service. Next, we scheduled
‘The Bridge.”’

Each Thursday at 7:15 p.m.,
Ehrenwerth, a sophomore politi-
cal science major from Ambridge,
Pa., holds a radio discussion with

»Chance1lor David H. Kurtzman,

over topics of student interest.
“‘The Bridge,”’ says Ehrenwerth,
“is a program designed to- pro-
vide a link between ’students and
the administration, during which
questions and issues are brought
to light.

“In ‘the past,” he continued,
“We _have dealt with state-re-
latedness, the out-of-state tuition
controversy, and the proposed
dorm site on the hill.” ~

The material for the program
is the questions that students ei-
ther write or telephone in to
WPGH. Questions from listeners
have ranged from “Why is the
Philosophy Department so good
and all the others so bad?” to
“When -are we getting a new
chancellor?”

“Chancellor Kurtzman is very
cooperative,” said Ehrenwerth, “I
think his actions are summed up
