'By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

It appears that at -least one of the
student rights published in Pitt’s
“Student Code of Conduct and
Judicial Procedures” has been
followed to great extent by some

SGB members and persons assoc- -' _

iated with Student Government
Board.
According to the code, “...the

Board of Trustees (and) the

University affirms the following
student rights and privileges...to
engage in‘ discussion, to make
inquiries, to exchange ﬁndings and

recommendations, to speak, write

or print freely on any subject...”

What’s been discussed-_—and to a
small" extent written about and
printed—a_re two issues that may or
may not be related in some way. _

The first issue involves questions
arising around would-be SGB
presidential candidate Jeff Miller
and his quality point average; the
second involves possible special
privileges that persons either on or
associated with the board may have
received from the i'egistrar’s ofﬁce.

Controversy .over Miller? s acad-
emic qualiﬁcations for placement
on the’ SGB presid/ential ballot
began Monday. Attiiat time Miller
said he thought it was “rather
unusual and conspicuous” that

Pitt News Staff Writer

The 12th ﬂoor suites of Bruce-
commonly known as the-_

Hall,
“university suites,’f are presently
under extensive renovation, which
ultimately will enable them to be
used as accommdations for “dis-
tinguished visitors” to the Univer-
sity, according to Dr. Edward

A Bozik, assistant chancellor at Pitt.

In addition to housing guests,
the suites will be used to hold small
conferences, small receptions and
fund raising events. '

Bozik said as far as he knows, the
university suites have been used to
accommodate special guests since
the buildings in Schenley Quad-
rangle, were converted from

private apartments into student»-

housing. '

Bozik added that most major
universities have accommodations
of this sort. / '

The suites on the ‘12th’ floor of
-Bruce Hall were, “in their day,
nice luxury apartments, part-
icularly suite 1201,” said Bozik.

Two years ago the ,university
decided to renovate Bruce Hall,
coverting all of the building’s
offices back into dorms, ' as they
once -had' been.

In the process of renovation, the ‘

13th ﬂoor was used up inorder to
provide security measure . such. as

After renovations are ﬁnished,’
the -three suites combined _will-

provide seven bedrooms, that can ’

Bozik. '

In‘ the past, the suites were

furnished‘ by donor gifts to the
university, such as paintings,
Oriental rugs, and? tapestries.
Pitt's Office of Special Events paid
for upkeep, Bozik said.

' During the renovations, these
furnishings were put into a storage
house, which later burned ‘down.-
Only the Oriental" ‘rugs were
salvaged, which were being
cleaned at the time. ‘

The university is currently
” looking around Pitt for furnishings
to replace those lost in the ﬁre.

Bozik also stated that the suites
will be operated on a “charge back

Miller said Steve Fendler,

Elections Committee, appoached

Miller has maintained that he did

until Friday, when his transcripts
were released to him after paying a
$16 room charge issued against
him after living in the dormitories

last year.

The transcripts showed three
“incompletes” on his records, and
Miller has contended he did not
know the ‘G’ grades were there.
His work for the three courses had
been completed and submitted to
the appropriate professors. With
the ‘G’ grades, Miller said he
discovered his QPA was‘ 2.339.

He said he then contacted the

professors and was assured’ the '

grades would be processed soon,
but were not before last Friday’s
deadline for submitting all required
paperwork to the SGB ‘Elections
Committee.’

Miller subsequently petitioned

the committee for ballot conside'ra- ,

tion, but his request was un-

animously turned down after _a
hearing Monday evening.

“All he had to offer were the

‘A’ from SGB board member Kim

Watterson, also a candidate for
board president.

“I heard it from Kim. She said \

she heard a rumor that Jeff’ s
grades might be below 2.5,” said
Fendler. “She then asked Mark
and myself about his eligibility and
we told her that we would have to
have a hearing about the matter if
his QPA were below the require-
ment. -
“I wasn’t making any inquiries
(into Miller’s record),” Watterson
said yesterday. “There were
C-umors ﬂying around the ofﬁce.
Many times people came to me and
asked me if I knew Jeff might not
be eligible. I was not the only
person who heardthis (and) I don’t
think anybody /right now could
pinpoint the source of the rumor.
“I am not the source‘ of the

rumor or the only relayer. It was

probably like a domino effect.“
Watterson continued that she
made the inquiry to \Fendler
because “I was wondering what
student government would do if

mine were the only name on the"

ballot. '
“I didn’t know for sure that Bill

"3 Abraham was running (but I knew)

Jeff was deadset about doing it,”
she added when asked why’ no

questions were raised about ‘

Abraham, whose name does
appear on the ballot for president.

“I did not see any (of Miller’s)
documents. I at no time knew‘ or
‘said ‘Jeff’s QPA is ‘X’.”

. .She said that “someone might
want to ask other persons about
that (knowing what Miller’s grade
point average was before he
claimed he was certain).”

“I heard rumors for a long time.

“I really couldn’t tell you about
it,” said board member Helen
Gianella. “I didn’t hear anything
like that at all.” - .
SGB President Stan‘ Galanski

“It shouldn’t have been ~

ANDY SMITH

said he also did —not hear any

persons either elected to the board

or working in some capacity with it
discussing Miller’s eligibility.
“There was_ probably discussion

- in general about the new QPA"

requirement (the ‘requirement ws
changed from a 2.0 to a 2.5 in a

.referendum- last year),”- said

Galanski. I would say there was
probably speculation overall about
the situation.

“It strikes me as being gossipy.
Anytime you have a political
environment where there’s also a
close social situation, these things
happen.” ‘ .

No matter who did-or did not
know Miller’s grade point average
was 2.5, Director of Student
Activities Andy Smith yesterday
initiated an “unofficial inquiry into
the case.

“There are concerns that have
been expressed,” Smith said,
adding that he had talked to Miller,
Galanski and other persons who
may have complaints; information

or other involvement in the case. _,
“We are concerned that the

Buckley Amendment be followed to
a tee.”

The Buckley Amendment to the

Family and Education Rights
Privacy Act stipulates that educa-
tional institutions receiving federal
funds designate rules, and reg-
ulations for obtaining access to

 

STAN GALANSKI

students’ official records;

At Pitt, the backbone of those
regulations is a rule that requires
no information be released without

' the student presenting identifica- 

tion and providing a signature.

Galanski said he asked Smith to
institute an investigation into the
case rather than have Galanski do it
because “I wasn’t sure Ifd be the
person who could easily get at the
information to solve the problem.
He (Smith) has 31 neutral perspect-
ive.” »

He said one other reason was
that “my administration is running
out of time.” Board members
elected for 1980 will be selected
Nov. 12-14 and will take office Jan.
8. ‘

In tire middle of speculation
about the Miller case, at least four
persons—all of whom have asked
not to be identiﬁed by Pitt News
reporters—have claimed that it
could be possible to play ‘peeka-
boo’ with Miller’s transcripts since
favors have been carried out in the
past for student government mem-
bers.

The favors are purported to
include having registration and
add/ drop forms~ processed after
deadlines, and computer cards

‘keypunched to gain admission to .

closed courses.
“I think anybody you asked that
of would probably say ‘no’,”

  
 

Galanski said, stating he had never
heard of such a set-up.

“Yeah, I heard about it,” said
Cordisco. “It concerned me very
much.” She said she did not
initiate an investigation, though,
because “it would be difficult for
me to do that. I was new to the
board and I wasn’t sure about how
to go about it.”

Cordisco coul_dn’t recall who

informed her of the existence of
any favors that may have been
received.

Infomiallnquiry
Not Enough

The admission by Steve Fendler, chairman of the
Student Government Judiciary, that Student
Government'Board member Kim Watterson told him
of a rumor about irregularities in Jeff Miller’s
transcript——-and subsequent statements by Watterson
and others that this rumor was discussed the week

before Miller claims he knew what his transcript‘

said——creates one large question about the whole
affair. What led all these people to believe Miller’s

' transcript would be a problem when Miller says he

was not concerned about it?
So far, the response to that question has been a

concerted shrug of the shoulders by those besides"

j Fendler who said they heard the rumor. SGB
members Rita Cordisco and Watterson said they
knew of the rumor about Miller’s transcript, but
could not recall where it originated exactly. SGB
-President Stan Galanzki offers a different view of the
situation, saying he heard no specific rumor, but that
he could understand why there might have been

.discussion about the effects’ of the grade _

requirements on prospective presidential candidates.
Still, this fails to explain why the speculation
centered on Miller. '

One action that could solve the mysteries of this
incident is the initiation of an “informal
inquiry” by Andy Smith, the director of the
Office of Student Activities, and advisor to SGB. By
next week, Smith said he should have some findings
about the sourceless rumors about Miller’s transcript
after he interviews the people involved in the affair.

Although this is a step in the right direction, it is I

not sufficient, considering the importance of the
issue involved. A great deal, of doubt now exists
about the integrity of SGB, all the people associated
with SGB and the elections beginning Nov. 12. the
doubts will remain until the source of the rumors is

‘ found. No legitimate election can be held while such
B a pallor hangs over student government.

In these
circumstances'the only satisfactory response is the
postponement of SGB elections and a full—scale
investigation into Miller’s case by Chancellor Posvar.
Provisions in Pitt’s student conduct code, which
specifies the rights of students and the rules that
govern them, gives ample justification for such an
act to be taken. The two most applicable student
rights, which the chancellor is bound by the Board of
Trustees to enforce, are listed adjacently in the code.
The first states that every student has the right to
have his school records kept confidential, and the
second -holds that all students have the right to a
representative student government—both of which
may have been’ violated. in the Miller Case.
The alleged violationlof the’ first is quite obvious.
If Miller did not discuss his Q.P.A. before he
submitted his transcript to the Elections Committee

last Friday, the only possible source of the rumor ,

about Miller’s record must have been some student
or employee of the Registrar’s Office who gained

access to the records. This would be both a violation ,

of Miller’s‘ right to confidential records, and of
regulations that make infringement of a student’s
rights an offense under the code of conduct.

The alleged infringement of ~Miller’s rights

becomes a violation of every undergraduate student’s,

rights because it comes as a consequence of his wish
to be involved in student government elections, and
thus raises dou ts about the honesty of everyone
associated wit SGB, including his prospective
opponents. Implicit in every student’s right to a
republican government is the right to vote for true
representatives, who exhibit the honesty and morality
of the voters. Students cannot be sure that they have

i this implicit right as long as there are doubts about

those involved ‘in SGB and in the SGB election, and
whether any of them had unauthorized access to
Miller’s transcript. ‘ '

Allowing Posvar to intervene directly is a clause of
the code, which gives the chancellor the power to
form and ad hoc committee to investigate charges
that are complicated or are of a severe legal nature.
This case meets both criteria because it is“ very
confusing, and servere legally, since it involves
possible violations of federal privacy laws.
more pragmatic level, the chancellor might want to
intervene because the case raises questions about the
integrity of the Registrar’s Office, which controls the
academic-records of all students; ‘Any questions a-
bout the security of such an office also raise great

doubts about the accuracy of any Pitt ‘student’s,

records, and the worth of such records. .

After Elevator Ordeal, Resident StudentsVoiceComplciint ,

A letter to Donovan Hughes,
director of housing:

We, as residents of Bruce Hall,
have a complaint:

The residents of Bruce Hall have
been unduly subjected to suffer the
pain and inconvenience of faulty
elevators. On Sunday, Oct. 28, all
the residents of Bruce Hall and
their guests had to walk up the
stairs because not one of the three
elevators was working. This of

_course -was an inconvenience, but

most students put up with it and
said nothing. The events on
Tuesday, Oct.’ 30 cannot be passed
off so easily. Nine Bruce Hall
residents were stuck in an elevator
for two hours and 15 minutes.

We were somewhat shocked
initially, and we tried to get out, to

. no avail. With the ringing of the

alarm, someone was notified. A
policeman arrived and he too tried

 .1 unsuccessfully to open the doors.
At this time we were told that an

engineer had been notified’ and

soon we would _be out.

After half an hour, an attempt
was made by an engineer, and the
door opened about half a foot, but
closed immediately. We were
elated that it opened and told him
to try it again, but he refused. He
insisted on calling Westinghouse
for another engineer. Later, we
found that the doors could have

been opened by the ﬁrst engineer, '

but he did not—reportedly because
he did not want to take the respon-
sibility for anything happening to
us while climbing out. Well, after
one-hour and a half had gone by,
we were still stuck in the elevator.
Certainly it is easy to imagine our
anger and dismay. We continually
pleaded for help from those on the
outside, but no one came to our aid.

“We have to wait for the
engineer, he is on his way,” was
always the reply from the police-
man. We were under the
impression that he was already on
his way an hour ago. Finally, after
two hours, we were told that the
engineer was getting people out of

an elevator in Lothrop Hall, and
that he would be here next.

After two hours of anguish and
suffering we were released from
the elevator; we had to climb out.
What was the magic instrument tha
the engineer had used? Was it a
crowbar? Was it an electric saw?
No, it was a simple key.

Why is it that nine students had
to put up with such a great
inconvenience when all that“ was
needed was a little key. Why is it
that we were not permitted to get
out during the ﬁrst engineer's
attempt? Fortunately, for the
university, none of us was
extremely ill or in transit to a
matter of extreme emergency.
Fortunately, we only missed a few
hours of study time, dinner and
classes.

When one is in a situation where
there is the probability of real
danger, one worries and we
worried to the extent that we would

have been at each other’s throats if i

we had not been rescued soon.
Why does something like this have

to occur? Why are there so many
problems with the elevators in
Bruce Hall? _

One reason for the problems with
the elevators in Bruce is that the
elevators are used by those who are
housed in the Chancellor's suite on
the 12th ﬂoor, and they are used by
the people who have offices on the
third floor. These supposedly res-
ponsible persons tend to set the
elevators off into a frenzy with their
keys. Thus, the students riding the
elevators are at their mercy. We do
not have keys to make the elevator
do what we want. We just get in,
and from now on, pray that it takes
us to our destination.

The system is wrong. Students
stuck in an elevator should not have
to wait for two hours until an
engineer from Westinghouse gets
here. The desk attendants should
have access to the magical key, or
at least the campus policeman

‘should have access to the key.

Furthermore, the housing office
has a responsibility to the stuents

to make the ~resider_ice’halls_H_V‘

habitable, and it is our opinion that
it has not fulﬁlled its responsibil-
ities when the office lets us suffer
in an elevator for over two hours. If
those persons who have a suite or

offices inthis building need to use ,,
an elevator, maybe one elevator - P’

should be set aside solely for their

use. This would leave the other
two" elevators strictly for the
residents. -

We demand that something be
done immediately to rectify the
situation. If the situation continues
as it is now, it is highly probably
that this will. occur again.
However,‘ next time the. university
may not be so lucky. We hope
there will be no next time.

Pitt News Staff Writer
Finally, two games away‘ from

“the end’ of its season, the Pitt

soccer team has found out what it's
like to be on the winning end of a-
1-0» game. Freshman Jim Bryne
scored with four minutes gone in
the second overtime period of
Wednesday's game at Gannon
College to lead the Panthers to the
victory.

Pitt had dominated the game
both offensively and defensively. In
addition to holding Gannon score-

-r.

less, the Panthers took 44 shots on
goal to the Gannon teams’ ‘10. ,
Shots were distributed evenly
among the Panther offense, with
freshman midﬁelder Tom Trempus
leading the team with 10. He was
closely followed by Hughes (nine),

~ Jeff Tissue (eight) and Al Adel-

rnann (six). ,.

Byme took a head pass from
teammate Bob Hughes to break the
0-0 tie.

Pitt again played a very physical
contest. Freshman wing Eric
Tiedtke, who started the game, was

injured five minutes into the match
and saw little action until late in the
game. Troy Norton, who saw a
considerable amount of action in
the game, took a blow to his ankle
late in the game, which may
hamper his play. for the remaining
Pitt contests.

The Panthers, who are coming
off back-to-back six goal losses (a
6-0 defeat to Penn State and a 7-1
loss to Lock Haven) have been
playing without the complete
services of their top-notch defen-
sive four.

  V\.
_. . .. ' h 

Outside fullback Tom Kunkel has
been out of action since early in the
Penn State contest. He may return

' for one of the Panthers’ remaining

two games. Also, fullback Jerry
Tomasetti has been hampered by
leg injuries.

Bryne, who scored/the winning
goal, has seen limited action this
year‘ because of the number _of

veterans on the squad. However,

since Byrne can play many
positions, he is a valuable member
of the team. Usually a fullback,é,he

mi... Bootersbowncannon inﬁrstl-0 wmoi season

was playing wing when he scored

the winning goal. 47%

Bryne is an example of the youth
represented on the Pitt squad this
season. At many points in the
Gannon contest, half of the Panther
team was composed of freshmen.
This gives Pitt soccer an optimistic
look for the next few years.

Pitt will travel to Indiana on
Saturday before the concluding
game of 1979 next Wednesday with
rival West Vir_gh1ia.

_. Kenny Bowles is looking to equal his Navy game performance tomorrow

against Syracuse.

Sports lnionnation photo

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

A PittNews Staffwriter
For the ﬁrst third of the season,
you wouldn't have known the
Panthers possessed a ﬂanker with
hands even Fred Biletnikoff would
bevproud of. His name is Kenny
Bowles who has stepped into the
forfront of the Pitt offense after an

inconspicious start. ‘ '

Bowles, a Rancho Cbrdoba
Junior College transfer, did not —see

too much action last year and was a _

virtual unknown in the starting

lineup. The senior Californian,

however,_has been making a name
for himself with his circus catches-
and his ability to haul in passes in a
crowd.

The Pitt offense has been
steadily improving and according
to Bowles, this is due to the
squad’s newly-found confidenceﬂ

“Players are starting to believe‘

in themselves,” said Bowles.

.“Everything is coming together

and the whole -team is going
great.”

The emergence of a set offense
has helped Bowles a great deal.

“Now that they’re throwing’ the
ball to me, I can relax and play my
game,” Bowles said. “I am

definitely playing with more

conﬁdence.” .
Bowles is a psychology major

who someday. hopes to become a v

psychologist, but for ,.now his
attention has been on burning
opposing defenses. »

Throughout his career, the 5-6,
150-lb. Bowles has put up with
skeptics who kept telling him -he
could not play due to his height.
Without a doubt, Bowles has
proved himself not only as a
receiver, but as’ a major college
receiver. He has shown that
ability, not size, is what counts.

Bowles can now look back . and
comment on his “lack of size.”

“I can’t go up for passes like
(Ralph) Still or (Benjie) Pryor 01'
(Cliff) Moore, and I can’t block as
well as they can, but I can usually
roam around the middle and go
unnoticed,” said Bowles. 5.

“It can also be a. psych factor,
because a cornerback comes‘ to the
line and sees me and maybe he’ll
start laughing,” Bowles added.
“By the time he’s done laughing,
I’m 15’ yards downfield with the
ball.”

The» Panthers currently are
ranked 12th in the nation, yet
Bowles feels this is a mistake.

“I think we’re better than the
12th-best team in the nation and
we’re going to prove that this week
against Syracuse,” Bowles said.

u   - Kenny ‘Bowles’ Over Critics as Flanker Excels

“For the past three years our
games have been decided by .a total
of seven or eight points, last year
being the closest with a one-point
win. We have got our work cut out
for us. _ !.

‘ ‘For anybody who does not think
that the Orangemen are not a major
team, all you have to do'is look at
the names of Hurley, Morris and
Monk, and yourealize that these
guys are ballplayers,” the senior
said. A

The Pitt offense will be ‘without
the services of Rick Trocano, who
injured his.har'n_string in the Navy
game. \Calling the plays will be
freshman" Dan Marino, who will
start his first game at Pitt. ‘Bowles

/.7?

said the main difference between -

Trocano and Marino is experience.

“Rick knows what's going on.
when to throw and when not to

_ throw and that all comes from

experience, ’ ’ , said Bowles.

“Dan is going to have to learn"
and will have the chance to do so
this week against Syracuse. Rick
was our leader and now‘ it’s going
to have to be a total team effort.’.’.-

Now, when‘ the Pitt offense lines
up, the 0.PPOsing defense will be
keeping an eye on No. 4, but
Bowles doesn’t mind. I-I'e’s faced

adversity before, and conquered it. .

Will Trocano Retum to Starter’s Role After Recovery from Injury?

Now that Dan Marino has cracked the starting
lineup due to Rick Trocano’s injury, the question
many people ask is whether Trocano will start when
he’s healthy enough to play. Trocano, for one, isn’t
sure.

“I like to think that I’m just out maybe two or
three games, and hope to ._ recover and be 100
percent,” Trocano said the other day. “I’d like to be
ready by Penn State orethe bowl game. I enjoy
playing_football. That's why I came here, and I’d
like to continue to play.” - ,

But for the time being, Trocano .will have to take it
easy, being careful not to aggravate the injury.

“Right now it gives me quite a bit of pain to ‘walk
up stairs, or any kind of incline,” Trocano said.
“It’s a pulled hamstring, a muscle injury, and it’s
gonna take some time.”

Before sustaining his injury in the Navy game,
Trocano had compiled some impressive statistics as
the Pitt quarterback. As a starter, he is 16-5, but
even that failed to impress his critics who say he can’t
beat the good teams, and that his record was built
against a group of patsies.

Compounding the problem was the presence this

‘ ByMARlASCIULLO
' Pitt News Staff Writer

For most of -Pitt’s cross-country
team members, this Sunday’s 3.1
mile John F. Kennedy Run in
Schenley Park will mark the end of
the season. At the same time, it
will give the‘ Panthers one last

. chance to convince the community

that Pitt does sport a- varsity
cross-country team this season.
Yesterday afternoon, the team
was halfway through a rare track
workout at Pitt Stadium when it
neared time for football practice.
As various joggers and little kids
were being shooed off the track, an
assistantlfootball coach called out

A _ to the varsity runners: “Hey, who
are you guys with?”

Such anonymity will not be the
case this weekend, as Pitt coaches

in and runners placed extremely well

at last year's JFK meet. Former
Pitt runner and present Duquesne
coach Dave McDonald won the
men’s division in 1978, with
Panther assistant coaches Mel
Boyd and Barry Harwick close
behind. Uridergrads Gary Siriano,
Randy Bailey are Jim Herrmann
also are among the returnees.

The meet will be run in divisions,
from nine-years-old and under to
open men’s and women's cdmpeti-
tion.

Sunday’s short course is met
with mixed emotions on the part of
the Panther runners. Freshman
John Hutchison, who ran the 3.1
distance in high school, but is a

 

 

veteran of 6.2 mile road races said,
“I like running six miles better
than three, because I have been
training for 10,000 meters.”

Rich Laitta, another freshman,
claims, “Six-point-two miles is too
far. I’m not used to‘ running that

9’

“This season was an intro-

duction to these longer distances,” '

he added.

 

Senior Jim Herrmann said, “I’d
rather run longer races because I’m
a marathoner. I enjoyed running
this year, but I was plagued by
nagging injuries.”

“It (injury) affected my season
and I felt Iididn’t do as well as I
should,” added Herrmann.

Newcomers Hutchison and Laitta
have adjusted well to the longer

cross-country distances and both
were pleased with their inaugural
seasons.

“My overall times have im-

proved,” siad Hutchison. “I have

enjoyed training with these guys
this year, more than in previous
seasons.” '

“I think I ran to what I was
capable of doing this season,” said

  Harriers llopeto Dispel Anonymity Sunday at Schenley    

Laitta.
The Panthers, incidentally, are
4 the defending team champion this
weekend, having handily defeated
the Jeannette Harriers Track Club
in 1978. Possible entries this Sun-
day include the University of West
Virginia and individually, former
Allegheny Community College star
Malcolm East.

The Panthers will again toe the Schenley line this Sunday. Pitt will compete in the annual JFK run. I
