PITT TRIUMPHS

OVER WESTMINSTER

“Polly” Galvin Scores 8 of the 18 l_’oints Rolled

Up Against the Blue and White

On last Sa'turday afternoon the Pitt
team rolled up a score of 18-0 against
the plucky team from Westminster.
The game differed greatly from the
previous contest with O. N. U., as
this team quit after Pitt had scored

12 points and allowed 24 more to be
scored before the end of ‘the game;
but Westminster was full of ﬁght all
the way through and kept the Pitt
players constantly on their toes.

The tackling of Ashton and Man-
sonwas low and sure and the former
got off some splendid punts. _Pit't
showed plenty of ginger but their
playing at times was a little ragged,
the handling of punts was not as good
as usual and several costly fumbles
were_made by the backﬁeld.

Pitt won the kickoff and held the
enemy for two downs, when they
were forced ‘to kick. Capt. “Tex” and
Quailey then carried thesball to with-
in 25 yards of the posts but Westmin-
ster’s, defense stiffened and held for
two downs, so Budd called on Galvin
for a_ place kick which failed. After
se‘e—sawing up and down the ﬁeld for
a few minutes, Rosenbloom and “Tex”
advanced the_ ball to striking distance,

but again the opposition braced up

and Galvin ‘tried another placement,
which failed oy a narrow margin.
After an exchange of punts the quar-
ter ended O-O. t '
On the ﬁrst down after the kickoff
Pitt tried an onside kick, but VVest-
minster got the ball, but lost it when
Blair broke through and "recovered a

fumble. "Pitt then started a‘ steady

march towardthe enemyfs goal, and
with Capt. “Tex” doing‘ the brunt of
the work, soon‘ annexed a touchdown,
the latter bucking his way through
center for the score. Galvin kicked
goal. Score, Pitt 6, Westminster 0.,

Westmiiister received ‘the kickoff
and worked "two good forward passes,
netting 25 yards, but this ended their
gain, as Stevenson tackled the next
runner for a loss and Quailey, who
seems particularly adept at breaking
up thevforward pass, intercepted one
and gained 5 yards before he was
downed, The backﬁeld quartet, Budd,
Rosenbloom, Quailey and Richards,
advanced the ball on_ end runs and
bucks ‘to the 5-yard line, where West-
minster held for downs.
down, Westminster punted and Budd.
after a momentary fumble, reeled off
20 yards, and a‘ short time later a fum-
ble prevented another touchdown be-
ing scored.

At thebeginning of the third quar-
ter,. Hittner and Dewar were substi-
tuted for Quailey and Budd and
“Billy” made a good ‘tackle. of the
man who received Galvin’s kickoff.

’ After Westminster had been held for

downs -and had punted, “Tex” gained

A 30 yards through a hole opened up by

. any more to the score.

On the next .

Dallenbach,. who, by the way, played
a good, consistent game and will prob-
ably prove,a standby in the future.
Westminster got the ball on a fum-
ble and again punted past'the danger
zone but Pitt was not to be denied
and gains by Richards, Dewar and
Galvin placed ‘the ball on the 5-yard
line and “Tex” carried it over from
here in two tries. Galvin kicked goal.
Score, Pitt 12, Westminster 0. _
' Toward the end of the quarter,
“Tex” caught a punt and returned it
to Westminster’s 5-yard line, where
ﬁve or six players tackled him at once
and prevented a touchdown. Time
was called-before 'the teams could
line up again.

The fourth quarter started with Pitt
in possession of the ball on Westmin-
st_er’s 5-vard line and from here Gal-
vin carried it over, but Pitt was penal-
ized for offside play, which put the
ball on the 15-yard line. Richards
gained 10 yards and -Galvin carriedit
over and also kicked goal. Score,
Pitt 18, Westmins'ter 0. A
’ Dave Richards was then substituted
for “big brother Tex,” Brown took
“Rosy’s” place, Vl/agner went in for
Lindsay," I-Iinchman for Dallenbach,
and Gehler for‘ S'tevenson. These
men all did well during the short time

‘Constitution is

Read and Adopted

At a meeting of the s'tudents in the
chapel last Friday morning the con-
stitution of the student senate came
up for discussion and ﬁnal action.
After considerable deliberation "and
debating upon the part of those as-
sembled, tlie consti'tution was formal-
ly adopted. The meeting was in
charge of John OiConnor, a former
student and president of the senate
last year. The staternent was made
that the senate had been since its or-.
ganization merely asocial body and
that greaterithings were to be ex-
pected this coming year. After the
new students were made familiar with
the purpose and working of the sen-
ate the work of adoption was taken
up. Very few changesiwere made in
the original document. outside of the
striking out of ‘the word “Courant”
and replacing it by the new title of
“The Pitt VVeekly_” The Fresh ob-
jected to the/words, “watching over,”
and after a great deal of fun indulged
in by both classes the matter was
ﬁnally changed to read “advise.” In
the mat'ter of holding the annual elec-
tions, it was decided to elect the sen-
ators ,for'the ensuing year on the
third '\/Vednesday in October. The
meeting was of great interest to those
present and goes to show the real
concern of ‘the students when any im-
portant matter is up for discussion.

The Schools of Pharmacy and
Dentistry opened on September 26,

trust good representatives will be
elected for the “Pitt Weekly” at
once.

STATE ROLLS. UP SCORE.

Judging from» the
score of 61-0 which State rolled up
against our near neighbor Tech, the
Centre county aggregation must have
a clever offense, which means a. battle
royal at Forbes- Field on°Thanksgiv-
ing Day.

spirit.

LECTURE TO ENGINEERING '
STUDENTS

OniMonday, October 3, Mr. Scott,’

who acts as consulting engineer for
the Wes'tinghouse Electric and Man,-
ufacturing Company, and ‘is promi-
nently identiﬁed with the American
Institute of’Electrical Engineers, lec-
tured to the engineering students‘ in
the chapel. While his remarks were
intended essentially, as he said, to
help the‘ Freshmen acquain't
selves with the ﬁeld they were en-
tering and to give. them a general idea
of the sort of work required, they
were equally applicable.to, and equal-
ly appreciated by, the engineering stu-
dents as a whole. , .

The chief point Mr. Scott made in
the course of his ‘talk was his asser-
tion that the man ‘most useful to him-
self and to the world in the engineer-
ing profession Was‘ the broad-minded,
cultured man rather than the over-
specialized man. He emphasized the
need for the man who can think and
reason independently and has the
ability to get along with and co-op-
erate with others-—-the man who can
take up a job and carry it through
to a successful completion. He also
brought out the fact that it was ‘the
student’s duty to himself to consider
his own individualcharacterand abil-
ity—to treat himself as he would a
machine as regards ﬁnding out his
adaptability and efﬁciency and reme-
dying his shortcomings. In this con-
nection he spoke o.f the need for
forming right habits of thought and
for cultivating the power of concen-
tration in order todevelop speed and
increased efficiency. ‘

The most important factor in col-
lege life is the students’ paper, that
week after -week chronicles the events
'of.interest. It is the duty of every
,lo‘yal college _man to supp_ort the

publication of his ‘alma; mater ‘and

this aid can be attained in two ways,
the ﬁrst is, always speaking in favor

_of the paper and the second, by far
the ‘ most important, is subscribing

for it. Just at this period‘. in the
history of the Weekly there .ispan
urgent‘ demand for support of the
ﬁnancial description and it behooves
every‘. Pittsburgh man to lend the
‘board. assistance at this time. Last
week we‘ put out ;the ﬁrst number and
it is but a taste of what is to follow
later" in the year. Through an un-
fortunate incident our business staff
was unable to present their full quota
of advertising, so i't was decided to

issue an entire news, number, which

con-tained all the happenings of open-
’-ing week. Lauder, ’1l,, has taken
chargeof the circulation department
and we earnestly hope no student will
refuse‘ the price. of a subscription.

I  CONVENTION.

The statemeetingoof the physicians
of Pennsylvania was held in ‘Memo-

 rial Hall the last week and attracted

a great deal of attention from Uni-
versity students. The metings were
of interest to those connected with
the medical profession, but the ex-
hibit found favor‘ with the people

LOCKERS FOR THE YEAR.

Thoseistudents who had lockers

"last year should a'ttend to the return-

ing of the keys given lastiterm. There
are many new men in the University

this fall and they are entitled to some -

considerationpin the way of receiving

’ ‘a locker. This is really important and

should be attended to by all the stu-
dents at once. ' '

 

THE CHANCELLOR SPEAKS.‘

On Friday afternoon, September 30,
the ' chancellir addressed an institute

-meeting held in the Carnegie lecture
_ room. One of the thingsemphasized

by the speaker was ‘the need for a

1 knowledge of the Greek language, not

alone for thescholar, but, the av-

“erage person as well.

THE PITT

Eveiiing School a _
S l I of Economics

On’ ‘Friday night, October 7th the
evening school~of Economics was
called t-o order with Clarence Sloan
presiding. The executive committee
submitted a list of new members who
were voted upon and admitted to the
evening school. The regular order
of businessqwas done away with to
give ample time for the election of
officers for the ensuing year. All the
members of the senior class’ were
candidates for ‘the office of president.
Mr. C. D. Wettach was elected in the
midst of much applauseand immedi-
atelytook office in accordance with
the rules and by—laws of the evening
school. B. P. Collins was elected
vice president; R..VV. Matthews re-
elected secretary, and Thomas J, Pen-
ney was elected treasurer.‘ Joseph T.
Murray was elected reporter for “The
Pi'tt Weekly.” . '

The evening school is to be con-
gratulated upon this most‘ favorable
beginning and for having elected men
of evident ‘ability to run their organi-
zation, Mr. Wettach is a man that
all have conﬁdence in and has demon-
.strated hi_s interest and ability in past
events of the evening school. The
Weekly wishesto show its apprecia-
tion to the school for having elected
a man of experience like Mr. Murray
to represent the evening school on
our paper and the board desires to
have the closest relation possible.

LACK OF CHAPEL.

Never before has the lack of chapel
been so forcibly demonstrated than
in the pas't two weeks when the pres-
ent assembly room is taxed, to its
fullest capacity.‘ Last year the condi-
tions were unsatisfactory, but this
term they are even worse, and it«is
clearly seen thatsome remedy mus‘t
‘be had at once. There has been some
discussion in regard to securing the
chapel of -the UnitedPresbyterian for
a generous convocation once a week
and in the faceof it the proposition
seems to be a good one. Surely the
church people wouldgive their con-
sent to such a planwhen the.m.ani—
fold beneﬁ't it would confer upon the
University is taken into considera-
tion. More pertinent than the mere
lamentation of our inadequate chapel
room ‘is’ the fact that some ‘Pitts-
burgher whosemoney is going into
other channels, vastly lless in1por't-
ant, might come. to our rescue‘ and
build a chapel to’ the ‘everlasting
credit of the donor. The s'tudents
have a splendid opportunity to place
this matter before the people.

AN OLD FACEMISSING.
The patrons of the book store are

 

V missing an old face, that has alway_s

borne a smile to the buyer and that
is the one of Charlie Schwartz.
Schwartz has ‘received a tempting of-
fer from a large ﬁrm engaged, in the
chemical business ‘and for the pres-
ent ‘the offer has taken Charlie away.

-The vacancy in‘the book store has

been ﬁlled by Parker Robinson. \

SATURDAY CLASSES.

-The announcement is made that Sat-
urdays are now being used for classes
at which full credi't toward a degree
will be given. A

"the study of Greek and the history of

Latin literature. Those desiring more

The w. and J. Defeat

In the Pi'ttsburgh papers the other
day a notice appeared saying the ad-
herents ‘of the’ University football
team were not elated over the defeat
of the rival down in Washingtonand,
such is exactly the case. We are not
gloating over the unfortunate start
‘Washington and Jefferson has made,
but, rather we are sorry, that the good
old opponents of ours have not the
foemen as of yore. A few. years ago
the athletic authorities .at W. and J.
made a ruling, that all one-year men,
that is Freshmen, were ineligible for
the various teams of the college and
on the face of it, it looked like a good
ruling, but that was in the palmy

days at the college and little thought

was given toithe future. Now the
proverbial rainy day has come and
the winter of discord is at hand with
the students wondering the why and
the_ wherefore. Most assuredly ath-
le'tics should be clean, but, where the
college is by reason of its size forced
to draw upon every available student

then the matter _of one year rules and

the like appear in a different light,
Thus, it is our opinion that our neigh-
bors and rivals have been alittle hasty
in their athletic jurisdiction. We are
not overjoyed to learn of their weak-
ness in the ﬁrst game, because that
is not the spirit of the true spor'ts-
man. Here is to a hearty hope that
the Red and Black shows a wonder-
ful improvement in their later games
and wins consistently until -the last
great day when the Blue and ‘the Gold
appears on the scene. ’

THE , CONSTITUTION.

The Senate presented for the ap-
proval of the students last Friday
morning the, much talkedpof consti-
tution and after somedeliberation the
document was accepted for the future
conduc't of the Senate. The Weekly
thinks the Senate has done well in
giving such an able code of rules for
the governing body, but, to be per-
fectly candid we believe the time is
not quite ripe for the advanced form
of department representation in the
various schools. The greatadvantage
in the prepara‘tion for the future is
also noticed and, therefore,‘ we are
able to say with perfect candor that
the constituti_on is wholly good. There
is nothing lik_e being prepared for
the morrow, so the senators and
others who labored in the perfection
of the documen't are to be compli-
mented for- their energy.

FOOTBALL SPIRIT. S

The football season is. here‘ Rand.
with it comes that real essence of col-
lege life—-college spirit. Last Saturday

we played a game and whil-e the.

cheering was good it was not as
strong as it, might be. Did it ever

occur to you what a good, whole- '

souled cheer, coming _straight from

the heart, meant ‘to the men strug-

gling on the gridiron. ‘It helps more

‘than any other part’ of encourage-

ment when across the lined ‘ﬁeld the

songs and cheers of alma mater ﬂoat".

Just ahead of us a littlepiece is the‘
Georgetown game and
the.Tech, West Virginia, W. and J.
and S'tate games. Some of these con-
tests.are of more importance than
others, but irrespective of this, the
spirit of Pittsburgh must be instilled
into all the games. Let us show the
people of Pittsburgh we have a Uni-
versity of which we are justly proud.
When the cheer leader calls for a
yell,‘ don’t mutter, don’t grunt, but

cheer just as loud when things are
going the wrong way as when the
advantage is in our favor. Let this
be a banner season in the true spirit

Public Speaking  
  the

If a college man today wants any-
thing ‘ he wants power—power ‘;to'
think clearly and straight, power to
act tactfully and wisely, power to
transfer thought into action that shall
produce results, power tovinﬂuence
and to lead men. Men who have am-
bitions which fall short of this ideal
have no place in any college. College
education is intended, if it is intended
for anything, for the ﬁtting of each
man to assume and ﬁll creditably a
man’s place in a world of men.

Surely he can never ﬁll such a
place if he goes forth from this place,
supposedly of preparation, tongue-tied:
ﬁlled with a vast jumble of vague and
disorganized thoughts and facts and
impressions, with no ability to face
men squarely and “give a reason for
the faith that is in him,” or the life
and the manhood tha'_t is in him,

_ Rightly understood and presented,

this and this alone is ‘the pur-
pose of training in public speak-
ing. In a sense, it is the object of all

rightly conceived English training.

'But no other subject presented at

college looks to this one grea't pur-

its object. I '

I am quite aware that public speak-
ing is 'not always thus understood.
There are many who persist in re-

. garding it as a spectacle rather than

a great battle of ideas. Eloquence,
even today, is measured often by the
cu‘t of the clothes, the length of the

- «hair, and the mere sound and fury of

the voice. Many today decide upon
the effectiveness of speech by the
amount _of noise produced, as a spec-
tator might judge the result of a bat-
tle by the comparative volume of the
thunder producedby the ‘opposing
sides, V

This method of judging ‘the func-
tion of public speaking, however, is
entirely beside the point. I have no
quarrel with the man who objects to
the spreading on of what seems to
him a merely external polish. But, as
I have had occasion a number of
times to remark and‘ doubtless shall
have again, it is obviously illogical
and unfair to judge a thing by precise-

'ly what i‘t is not." It is manifestly

unfair to judge music by rag—time, or
drama by melodrama, orripoetry by
y rhymes, or journalism by the

-what is commonlyknown as- “yello-
cution”—by the, swing and display of

ﬂexible arms combined with hideous,

and’ artiﬁcial vocal gy_mnastics. V
To create and_ establish here at this
university, as it exists at niany other
great. universities, a true conception
of and a sanely enthusiastic attitude
toward public speaking is one of the
leading pur-poses of the present plan
for this in-stitution. ',Not - a faculty
member, so far as I know, but is in

' hearty accord with it. All those who

have given the ma'tter careful thought
fully realize that if this university is
tofiilﬁll the demand which the com-
munity is urging upon it, that if this
university is to develop men qualiﬁed

-to take a worthy place among men,
that-thestudents must .learn the art '

of speech. . They realize thy the ‘re-
sults of the training are brain-power
and personality., They.realize that
for _college—men, the _declaration of
Emerson is profoundly true and pro-
foundly important, that “the effectof
any utterance upon the public mind
is in direct proportion to its depth of

o

pose more speciﬁcally and solely as

_ ,

THE PITT

and

University   Men

 

thought,” and that the power of
speech is an index to “the man be-
hind the speech.”

The practical meaning of all this is
that a campaign has begun looking
toward raising public speaking to the
place which it is generally believed i‘t
should occupy..* This ‘can never. be
done apart from the co-op.eration of
the student body and the whole stu-
dent body, especially the college and
the school ofengineering. There is
one thing that- I earnestly Want this
student body to do, and ‘that is: look
into this matter. Find out what it is;
but, above all,’ﬁnd out what it is not.
If, after examining into its purposes,

you decide that it is not eminently

worthy of a large place in this insti-
tution, direct your inﬂuence where it
will place the work “in the course of
ultimate extinction.”. But, if‘you de-
cide it is worthy, throw.yourselves
into it, We need your brains, your
inﬂuence, your sympathy. And you,
we think, need us. ‘ ..

with the summer school of the Uni- '

versity‘ of Tennessee. The school
which is carried on in the University
building is the largest ‘one of its kind
in’ ‘the south. Students from all parts
of the country come to the southern
institution for their summer’ work.
The University of’ Pittsburgh is hon-
ored by having one of its professors
a member of this great summer
school. Thework which Dr. Holds-
worth is at the head is along the
same lines as his duties here.

 

FRESH ELECT OFFICERS.

Friday morning the Freshmen class
held a meeting to select class officers
with ‘the following results: Presi-
dent, Cummins; vice president, Hemp-
hill; secretary, Miss Kingftreasurer,

Crookston; football manager, Camp.

Camp, the newly elected football
manager, is a former Mercersburg

man, where he participated in ath-

letics. A‘ start has already been made
upon the schedule, which will con-
tain many leading scholastic teams.
The Freshmen have an excellent op-

portunity to place a clever eleven on

the’ gridiron this fall.

DR. McCORMICK ON COMMIT-
TEE.-

Dr. McCormick is one of a com-
mit'tee, which will decide whether or
not the Meadville Theological Sem-
inary can confer a degree of divinity.
The others on the committee are G.

.M. Phillips, of West Chester State

Normal and President _H. A. Apple
of F. and M. College.

WAKEN UP GIRLS.

It has often been noticed that the
girls rarelyrespond ‘to the hearty ap-
plause given by the students at chapel
time. Whether the girls are unable
to master the deft motionof the hand
necessary to produce the noise is un-
known, but it seems a try would cause
no harm; , .

Splendid ‘Opportunity

A course in musical appreciation is
now being offered by‘ the University,
work in theinew department having
started’ last Friday afternoon. The

classes will convene every Friday aft-

ernoon in the chapel room a't 32,30.
Persons whoihave not had previous
‘musical experience ‘are as welcome
and as eligible as those wh . have
studied before; the object being not
the individual instruction of the stu-
dent in singing and playing, but,
rather the provision of the informa-
tion necessary to a more intelligen't
appreciation of music. _ ,

It is expected that this opportunity
will interest a number of persons who
wish some deﬁnite musical informa-
tion and yet do not have time or
chance for the serious study of some
ins'trumeiit.

The course is under the direction of
Mr. Charles M. Boyd, who has a rep-

utation in the city that is a most high’

one in all the various, circles.

CLUBS MEET.

The, Glee and Mandolin Clubs ‘held
a very spirited meeting last’ Tuesday
evening in Thaw Hall for the purpose
of electing officers for the.
year_ The spirit shown at the initial
gathering of the musical" men was in
keeping with the ‘true sentiment be-
ing shown in all departments of the
University these days. The following
men were elected 'to t_he various of-
ﬁces in'the clubs: Cunningham, man-
ager; committee. on trials, Young,
Cooper, McDaniels; committee on the
Mandolin Club, Cratty, Smertz, Mack-
rell; committee» on constitution, Hall,
Frost, Blakeley. The newly elected
manager is a former Amherst man
and has a reputa‘tion for doing things.
A more complete announcement of
the clubs’ plans for the winter appears
in another place. . -

THE NOON HOUR.

Some misunderstanding has been
caused by the new noon hour period
and the faculty has been busy mak-
ing explanations tofthe students who
do not relish‘ the idea of no lunch.
Prof. Bankson has, however, cometo
the aid of the wondering ones by‘ an-
nouncing ‘that the schedule is made on
the basis of. the old ﬁfth period‘ and
that all noon hours ‘will be distinctly
marked for the beneﬁt of those in
the course. The endeavor has been
made to keep as many -hours as pos-
sible in the old way of doing things.
It is easily seen why the schedule is
forced to be --a’ part of the regular
nono hour, the large number of
courses offered by ‘the University this
year making it imperative to utilize
every possible minute of time in the
day. ’

 

THE WAYNESBURG "GAME.

Next Sa'turday the ﬁrst real big
game of the season takes place at
Forbes Field and that -means
every son of Pittsburgh should be
there. Not much is known of the vis-
iting eleven, but let us‘ so root that
when they leave the ﬁeld 'they will
know that we have a loyal undergrad-
uate' body. The coming ‘game will af-
ford the first real insight into our
team’s ability this year and it is quite
likely that we will have plenty to do
to defeat the Waynesburg passers.

The fact that the game will be
played at Forbes Field will give a
chance to display our rooting powers,
better than the last two games in
Wilkinsburg.

The withdrawal 0, fthe Rev. Joseph
Horner, D. D., LL. D., from the office
of treasurer of the Pittsburgh Con-

Church, which he had held for 40
years, was tl1e’ﬁI‘SlC of the impor'tant

last Wednesday. Dr. Homer is- 87

AND THIS, FROM BRYNF MAWR! _

Bryn Mawr College, probably the
most exclusive seat of learning in the
country for young women, opened last
Wednesday for its twenty-sixth term
with anaddress from the president,
Miss M. Carey Thomas, cautioning
the 450 young ‘women ‘present against
hazing. The'young women, strange

as it may seem,‘ giggled at the. ad?

vice;

The advice from Miss Thomas _re--
garding thehours was just l2 hours
The hazing ‘started about 10. -

late.
o’clock last night. Several of the
freshmen arrived at the college ‘hours
in advance of the opening and the
sophomores decided that they should
be hazed. From some source "the
sophomores coralled ll suits of male
attire. Into these they forced the
freshmen. The sophomores then pro-

cured horsewhips and ’tis said ordered

the freshmen to head for the city. I

According to a farmer-who saw
the shapely procession, the freshmen
werenot a‘ particle afraid of the city

bright ligh'ts and were dancing 'nim-'

bly along the road. The farmer, how-
ever, notiﬁed the college and several
instructors headed off the hazers and

the hazed before they reached theil

cit,-y.

EXHIBIT PROLONGED.
University students will be gratiﬁed

to learn that the summer loan exhibi- _

tion of paintings in the galleries of
Carnegie Institute -iwill‘be ex'tended
for some time longer. The attendance
at the exhibition has been so much
larger this summer than ‘in previous

years and the interest manifested in
the collection has been so gratifying

to the director of ‘ﬁne ar'ts that‘he'has
made arrangement whereby the paint-
ingsmay remain on exhibition for a

longer time than was at first planned;

The paintings now on exhibition be-
long to private collections, being

.loaned to the institute for this special

purpose, and the exhibition was made
possible only through the generosity
of the contributors: F“ . Nicola,
Mrs. Charles Donnelly, Herbert Du-
Puy, Cliilde, Hassam, Miss Helen O.
Brice, Robert C. Hall and the John

Caldwell estate.

THE CO-EDS!

Fifteen girls entered college this
year. Miss Colcord of Smith College
is an addition ‘to the ‘Senior class; Miss
Carpenter is a Sophomore; three are
special students and ten are Fresh-
men. This is the largest, number of
girls to enter at one time. With in-
creased facilities and improved con-

ditions for co—education~ the number - — —

of young women in the University is
bound to increase s'teadily.

THE PITT WEEKLY

Y. M. c A. Meeting

The first meeting of the Y. M. C.
A. took place last Wednesday morn-
ing in the chapel. The attendance
was not what it should have been and
it is greatly regretted that the students
do not take anymore interest in this
branch of work. The Y. M, C. A.
stands for all that is good and their
great numbers throughout the coun-
try shows the merit of the work. It
seems that an endeavor could be made
to strengthen the association here
by calling upon ‘the students to sup-
port the matter as a part of the Uni-
versity. It is planned to have some
very interesting study this winter and
the opportunity should not be missed
by those .desirous of entering the Y.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO L
GROUP v ANDVVI STUDENTS,

The U. S. government and the vari-
ous state and city laboratories are
constantly in need of young me-n and
' microchemical
and food analysis. These positions
offer salaries which are usually much
higher than tho_se given the ordinary
chemist or biologist, and the demand
for food chemists is far in excess
of the supply. _ G .

The Universi'ty has -laboratory fa-
cilities for both of these -courses which
are equalled by very few institutions
‘in the entire country. Theiequipment
is very complete and thoroughly up
to date; and the methods taught are
those in use by the Uni'ted States
government.

Students in Group V and the Chem-
istry Group are asked to take cog-
nizance of the above facts. For furth-
er particulars see, page lll. of the
University catalog or call at the of-
{ice of Professor Silverman, 306
