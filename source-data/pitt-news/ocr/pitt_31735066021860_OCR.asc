Pitt student assaulted;  
locals take precautions 

By Lisa Hallman
Staff Writer

The stabbing of a Pitt student
has left a family living near
Carlow College questioning the
adequacy of police protection in
the area. .

Richard Opiela, 22, was
stabbed in the neck last Wednes-
day by an unidentified black
male. _

Opiela was driving down
Chesterfield Road when the sus-
pect smashed a beer bottle on his
car window, police said.

According to a an anonymous
witness, Opiela stopped the car
and said, ”What do you think
you are doing?”

”He got out of his car and the’

[suspect] pulled out a knife and
said, ’What do you think of this?’,
and [Opiela] said,‘ ’We|l, come
on,’ and they got in a fight and
the [suspect]~ended up stabbing
[Opiela],” she said.

However, the witness said the
stabbing itself did "not distress her
and her family as much as not

. seeing any police respond to the

situation.

"What really upset us was the
fact that [a Carlow College secu-
rity officer] was right there turn-
ing down Chesterfield and when
he saw all of this going on, he
backed up.”

Lieutenant Dan MacConneIl of

Judge Ruggero Aldisert, a mem-

Aldisert said Nordenberg guid-

According to Nordenberg, ‘the

Reagan says attacks must stop; death toll up

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said Tuesday that the at-
tack on the USS Stark ”must
never be repeated” and that from
now on, the order for U.S. sailors
in the. Persian Gulf will be: ”De-
fend yourself.”

Reagan, in a high school com-
mencement address delivered in
Chattanooga, Tenn., said that,
”American sailors are putting
their lives on the line in the gulf.
They have a right to protect them-
selves.”

He spoke several hours after
the Pentagon revised the death
toll from Sunday's missile attack
from 28 to 37.

”This tragedy must never be

I’ repeated,” the president said.
”Our ships are deployed in the.
- gulf in order to protect U.S. in-
Iterests, maintain free access and
‘maintain freedom of navigation

and access to the area's oil sup-
plies. It is a vital mission, but our
ships need to protect themselves,
and they will.”

From now on, he said, ”if air-
craft approach any of our ships in
a way that appears hostile, there

is one order of battle. Defend
yourselves. Defend American
lives.”

Church duped lady of
millions, court rules

_ WORCESTER, Mass. — A fed-
eral Bankruptcy Court judge
ruled Tuesday that a fundamen-
talist church ”abused the trust” of
a chain store heiress and ordered
the return of $6.6 million which
the woman said she was duped
into donating.

» U.S. Bankruptcyjudgejames F.

I Queenan Jr., who had presided

over a three-week, "non-jury trial
that ended April 17, ruled that Bi-
ble Speaks founder Rev. Carl H.
Stevens was guilty of ’’clerical de-
ceit, avarice and subjugation.”

The Bible Speaks Church had
said a ruling in favor of Elizabeth
Dovydenas would result in its
financial ruin. V

Mrs.’Dovydenas, 34, had sued
the church, Stevens and member
Kathy Hill for the return of dona-
tions she made while a parishion-
er from 1983 to 1986. ’

Lovers convicted of
fleeing in helicopter

SAN FRANCISCO — Two
lovers who fled federal prison in
a stolen helicopter last November
were convicted today of charges
stemming from their escape.

Ronald Mclntosh, 42, and
Samantha Dorinda Lopez, 37, sat
side by side as the verdicts were

- read in U.S. District Court. Lopez

placed her hands over her mouth,
but both remained speechless.

Mclntosh was found guilty of‘
wire fraud when he met ‘Lopez
working in the business office of
the federal prison in Dublin,
about 30 miles east of San
Francisco.

Clarification

In the May 13 issue of The Pitt
News, the statement, ”The universi-

. ty has a responsibility to adequately

supply [condoms] to the students,”
was attributed to Student Govern-
ment Board President Phil Moyer.
The statement should have read,
”The SGB and Student Health Serv-
ice should be willing to supply them
to the students.”

Also, Jennifer Hitchings was incor-
rectly identified in a photo as Jennifer
Harris. The Pitt News regrets these

 Should condoms be condemned!

"That question to students after learning that the Pitt-
Bradford campus is awaiting a decision from its
administration that will determine whether or not

l

condom machines will be installed.

Kathy Valentine

”l don't think there's anything
wrong with them. Pitt realizes the
problem with AIDS. I don't care
where the machines are, but in
the bathroom would be more ap-

’/propriate.” -
Sue‘ Falo

’’I don't think it should be on
campus. It's too tacky. The
university offers enough health
services. It would degrade the
university/’.

Jim Naich

”l have mixed reactions. There
is a need for it. I'm wondering if
putting them ‘up on campus is the
proper’ place to do it. It may
offend people's tastes."

Jocelyn Harper

’’I think college students by

now should know what to do —

' what precautions to take. Why

does the university have to be
responsible for people?”-

”Condom Awareness Day” has become a big
event on campuses across the country. According
to 5GB president Phil Moyer, ”There’s been no talk
yet of a ’Condom Day’ at Pitt, but the issues con-

" cerning the subject are of major concern to the stu-
dent community.” '

being a responsible adult, it
would be for our benefit. I feel it
should be in discrete places, like
restrooms.”

CGS alumni gather
for Pitt weekend

By Rae Ann Collette
Staff Writer S

The University of Pittsburgh
College of General Studies
sponsored a bicentennial re-
union this past weekend for
CGS students, alumni, and
their families.

”The reuninon was a great
success. The CGS students and
alumni, enjoyed themselves
enormously,” Associate Dean
of ‘the College of General
Studies Anne Levenson said.
”Of course, the beautiful
weekend weather helped.”

Levenson said this- past
weekend was full of new ac-
tivities and experiences for the
people associated with CGS.
The weekend reunion consist-
ed of a combination of special
classes, tours, and dinners.

”The CGS students and
alumni enjoyed hearing some-
thing academic without hav-
ing to take notes,” said
Levenson. '

Other activities included
swimming at Trees Hall, ten-
nis at Pitt's courts, tours of the
Nationality Rooms, a tour of
the Carnegie «Museum, and
various luncheons and

dinners. -
”The turnout of former an
present CGS students was very
good," CGS’s Director for De-
velopment June Wormsley
said. ’’I’d say we had about

125-150 people attend the _

various events.”-

A special dinner—dance high-
lighted by line ‘ dances and
"golden oldies” kicked off Fri-
day night's festivities.

”The majority of the alum-
ni who attended the reunion
were in their 50's and 60's so

they really appreciated the '

music,” said Wormsley.

On Saturday night, the CGS
students and alumni gathered
together at the Forbes Quad-
rangle Galle_ria to watch the
presentation of various
awards.

Lee Gutkind and Alfred E.
Lawson both received the first
Distinguished CGS Award _for
outstanding community,
university or professionai serv-

ice. Alice S; Donnelly and

Otto Szabo, Jr. both received
the Volunteer Service Award
for their services to the Univer-

sity and to the CGS Alumni As-'

Seeing the price

This week, NBC's Today amorning news and entertainment
show, is visiting and broadcasting from America's ”five most
livable cities.”

Since Pittsburgh is first on that list, we were the first city
visited.

The show was a public relations coup. Civic and academic I

leaders came on and sang the praises of Renaissance ll’s
skyscrapers and super-computers. -Jamie Lee Curtis, in town film-
ing a movie, told ‘the nation about the home she's renting in
Shadyside and lauded the neighborhood's quaintness.

Yes, Pittsburgh was just about to shed its rust belt image. That

' is, until ‘a correspondent did a rather disturbing story during

the last half-hour of the broadcast.
It's true that Pittsburgh has come a long way in recent years.
High tech is revolutionizing our city's economic base. .
However, something is being trampled by this revolution,
and that something is people. The very people who, through
their sweat and hard work, brought about Pittsburgh's original

' prosperity — the now formersteel workers. .

The Today report centered on the plight of a few unemployed

families from the Mon Valley. The reporter interviewed these -

families and followed them through the skeletal remains of what

» once were financially secure towns. Soup kitchens, boarded

up store fronts and the tale of Clairton a town that can no longer
afford its own police force assaulted the senses of anyone who
watched the program. One gentleman in the interview said,

V ”Sure, you can walk down these streets and not get mugged,

but you don't have a dime for anyone to take in the first place.”
‘ The steel industry is not coming back to the Mon Valley. ‘But
that's no reason to forget the downtrodden.- Local politicians
give a lot of lip service to attracting new industries to the area,
but children still go to bed hungry. There's talk of re-education
programs for the unemployed, but parts of Allegheny‘ County
remain virtual welfare states. » -
If Pittsburgh truly wants to be No. 1, we'll stop pretending
that the Mon Valley doesn't exist. '

Marching quickly
onthe road to ruin

‘ H Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, has expressed his
~. deepest regret over the painful incident.” Ronald Reagan shuf-

‘ fled off to Tennessee to speak to a graduating high school class.

Thirty-seven Americans were killed, and as of yesterday, 15
were still missing.

The reaction in Washington has been remarkably cool, as
the most’ important question seems to be why thefrigate was
riot able to return fire. Reagan has said that there will be a full
investigation of the incident. , _ I

The reparations demanded by U.S. government officials of
Iraq were not mentioned In the letter Hussein sent to the State
Department. ~

,removed -from the board. P g:  - " '~ j T ~ .

I TUNG IN To THese IRaN-CoNTRa Hear-mos...

Not my favorite music, not my
favorite cult, The Grateful Dead
are a rich part of American Rock
Heritage. A

Psychedelic country, with a
flare for Egyptian mysticism, The
Grateful Dead undoubtably have
the most unique, genuine and
loyalfollowing of any American
rock ’n’ noll band.

A Grateful Dead tour is a pil-
grimage for thousands of dead-

heads. Like the muslims who

journey once in a lifetime to Mec-
ca, the deadheads are neverfful-
ly initiated until they witness their
heroes in Red Rocks Coliseum,
the beautiful, natural ampitheatre

in Colorado.

Selling L.S.D. inspired car-
toons, tie-die T-shirts and photo-
graphs, the poorest deadheads
turn the parking lot of the con-
certs into a bazaar equivalent to
a Turkish bazaar where fakirs sit

panhandling on carpets of nails. .

The Grateful Dead’s leader has
become Bob Weir,’ who remains
the most healthy member of the"

group. Jerry Garcia, who was the

leader for years after the death of
'Pig Pen, is_ now so fat and near
comatose" that his final cosmic
spiral of oblivion is nearing. But

In_ his letter, which appeared in
the May 12 issue of The Pitt
News, Daniel Keleti writes that
medical care ”must be available
to all segments of our society, be-

cause it is essential to everyone.”
‘ Mr. Keleti regards individual lives

(e.g. doctors, taxpayers) as pub-
lic property, and he feels free to

indulge inva little_ armchair‘

totalitarian planning. What is
your next order, Comrade Keleti?

Now what _ can justify the
sacrifice of those taxpayers who
earn their right to medical care to

_ those who clamor for- something

for nothing? Medical'se_rvice, Mr.

Keleti writes, is a ‘f social respon-

need a leader, so that title is de-
ceptive.

They rely on a sort of sixth

sense when working together.
They often spend long ponderou's
moments between songs, some-
times tugging in two different
directions, searching their moods
and the cosmic intuitition for the
appropriate song to play.

‘Probably more tragic than any

of them seem to realize, The
Grateful Dead have done very lit-
tle to reach their fans — fans who
have turned to them with joy and
in search of values and freedom —
— only to find dejection, incoher-
ent mysticism and a fat and aged
grand-daddy of rock in Jerry Gar-
cia, wavering half-mad at death's

Music is an industry — and a .

very manipulative one at that.
The Grateful Dead; have’ played
the industry so well, and they
have done records so consistent-
ly without anything resembling a
hit, that it would probably hurt ’
record sales badly if suddenly
they made it up the charts. This
is counter-culture magic, to be
sure.

parently, we have no right to the
fruits of our labor, but must hand
over our property to fulfill our
”social' responsibilities,” as deter-
mined by Mr. Keleti.

Whatcan possibly justify the

enslavement of our doctors,
which is the eventual result of so-
cialized medicine? Mr. Keleti's
answer is indicated by his com-
ment that medical care is ’’essen-
tial to everyone.” The doctors are A
chained precisely because of the‘
crucial importance of the services
they offer us. »- ' ‘

Ultimately, it is hard to say how '

I feel about The Grateful Dead.
While experiencing them in
Hampton, VA many years ago, I
saw something of the ancient
sage and pharoah and prophet in
Jerry Garcia during the rendering
of a tune called, ’The Wheel’.

Still, I don't respect him as a man, .

because his thoughts are empty
and his high flying spirit has
soared right into Alpha without
much ‘return. ’

The Grateful Dead is one ver
good example of how count -
culture got put off track in t
'60s and '70s. Drugs, free love
and rock ’n’ roll are forms of pol-
lution, if they are pursued with
nothing except abandon. Music
shouldn't be mystified, and cults
shouldn't be so worthless and
decadent, overall.

The one truly remarkable thing
about The Grateful Dead is that
they have their own genre, art

medium, and ‘ complete art;’/

history. r .

The Grateful-Dead is more than --
"music, it is a religion, too. And

like all religions, it is more theat-
er and Charlatans than prayer and
transcendence.

poses or anything else. .

sic films. Over this past Christmas

rized version of Frank Capra’s

Hogwash! Taking classic films,
classic pieces of the art form, and
adding color to them under the
pretense that ”this is the way the
makers would have wanted them
but they either didn't know about
color or they just didn't have the
funding” is nothing but pure, un-
adulterated mutilation. I can just
imagine what they'll try next.
”Hmmm, let's just straighten out
these lines a little on this Picasso
because that's the way he really

Perhaps you think I’m roman-

Pleasant phrasings
— on pretty paper

I never thought much
about the subliminal sym-
bolism involed in writing
letters. It always seemed to
be a fairly simple exercise:
Roll the paper into the type-
writer, bang away for a few
paragraphs, and send the
sucker off.

But I have been informed
that I am wrong. Very
wrong. M Z

Wiggins Teape — Eu-
rope’s oldest and one of its
most prestigious paper
companies — is entering
the U.S. market for the first _ M
time in its 224 year history. Since its founding in 1761, Wig-
gins Teape has produced fine writing paper from its base in Bri-
tain. It is a company devoted to the proposition that the kind
of writing paper one uses makes a difference in one’s life.

To me, the height of elegance as far as stationary goes has
always been an 8‘/2-by—11-inch piece of white bond paper with
a picture of a newspaper building at the top. So when I learned
that Martin Blockley, overseas marketing manager for Wiggins
Teape, was making a business trip’ to the United States, I took
the opportunity to ask him about stationary and the people who
use it. '

- I first asked Blockley whether the kind of paper a person writes
on really makes any big difference. a

”Well, I would suggest that it does," he said. ’’I think in terms
of quality perceived across the desk; if you receive a letter that
is written on a piece ofjunk, your instinct is to chuck it aivay."

He said that there is a trend to quality in business stationary.
He said Wiggin Teape’s Conqueror brand, which dates back
to 1888, is manufactured in 18 different colors.

It

”lfyou-received an-envelope in claret, don't you think you'd I

read the letter inside?” he said. ”I reckon you would.”
Blockley expressed a total disdain for white bond paper -

the kind of paper most of us are used to writing on. ”Bond paper.

has an-impersonal feel,” he said. ”It is rather flat, smooth -

just uninteresting. A qualitypaper has a different feel and look, I
» and it says something about the person who chooses to use it.” M.
He said a letter must serve as a surrogate for its writer's per-. . - - 

sonality on occassions when the writer cannot make acall in
person. ”Your stationary can portray you as sympathetic,” he
said. ”It can portray you as aggressive. It can portray you as
creative. It can even portray you as sexy.

’’I would suggest that the individual who knows how to
present himself in person should also know how to present him-
self on the stationary he chooses. A person's stationary should

tell you something about the person even if you have never._

met him. People like to dress well, like to carry fine handbags
 the same should be true for their writing paper.”
Blockley said that most corporations still choose the color

white for their letterheadstationary, He was adamant, though, .

in arguing that there is a noticeable differencebetween justany
piece of white paper and a fine piece of white stationary. _
’’In the United Kingdom, people are aware of presentinga
certain image,” he said. ’’I would suggest to you that the fact
mons uses our paper, means something.
”The message is coming across quite clearly that we are in

that Margaret Thatcher uses our paper and the House of Com-’

a very quality-conscious age. Just sending out a letter on white \

bond paper will no longer do. More and more people are
demanding an cotton-containing paper. It may be a little more
expensive, but it sends a message about the writer.”

I asked him if he thought people really paid any attentionlto .

the kind of stationary they received in their daily mail.

”They may not be aware of it,” he said. ”But every piece 

of stationary carries its own message. A fine piece of writing
paper has a‘ nice tactile feel. The writing that appears on it stands
out as being crisp and clear. That's a good word —' crisp. A piece
of fine writing paper makes a crisper presentation. ' .

’’I would suggest that the Xerox copy paper so many people
use féels nondescript and hard. Fine writing paper makes you
feel different the moment you pick it up —- and even the mo-
ment you write your signature. As you sign your name, you can
feel the difference.”

I Blockley said that when a person puts a letter in the mail, _
he should be as conscious of how it looks as if he were deliver- _
A ing it face to face. ’

”You should be proud of what you're sending,” he said.
”Most corporations are fairly conservative, and their letterheads
reflect that. There's nothing wrong with that —' as long as the
look and feel of the stationary does not carry a message of lack
of quality.

”One must be constantly aware of the ordinariness of ordi-‘

nary paper,” hesaid. ”It’s just so  ordinary. I would suggest
that -it simply does not do to be ordinary."

.l ATLANTA — Aggressive
chemotherapy is saving the lives

_of some women with advanced ‘
breast cancer who would almost’

certainly die if given standard
treatment, researchers said
Tuesday.

Several studies presented at a

cancer meeting demonstrate that -
drugs can save many, though still

a minority of, women whose
breast tumors are not spotted un-

sleeping. Physical ailments that
often accompany such cases of
depression are joint pains, stiff-
ness, headaches and muscle
cramps. »
According to Steven Schneider,
associate director of Allegheny
General Hospital's in-patient psy-
chiatric unit, ”[Patients’] ability to
concentrate and initiate projects
is greatly impaired,” which leads
to patients reporting difficulty at
work during their depressions.
SAD usually begins in early
adulthood and affects women
four times as often as men. Ac-

. cording to Schneider, women are

more apt tolcome forward and
seek help, whereas the men tend

til they have spread to the chest
wall.

Such tumors, ‘so-called locally
advanced breast cancer, often are
considered inoperable. They are
too large to be removed com-
pletely, and surgery makes the re-
maining cancer grow even faster.

Typically, patients with this
stage of breast cancef are treated
first with radiation therapy.

”Radiation would control the.

to cover the depression with
other defenses such as alco-
holism.

Most of the SAD sufferers claim ’
a history of a major psychologi-

cal disorder in at least one close
relative and experience some
form of mania. This mania is
characterized by an elevated
mood beyond normal circum-
stances and the feeling that the in-
dividual‘ must make up for lost
time.

The mania and the depression
are caused by biological changes
that are meditated by the secre-
tion of Melatonin by the pineal
gland. The interval of MT secre-
tion is characterized by the‘ time

recurrence,” said Dr. Michael
Perry of the University of Missou-
ri. ’’In the past, virtually all of

these patients had been con-

signed to die.”

The latest research, presented
at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical On-
cology, used a variety of combi-
nations of drugs and hormones to
shrink large tumors so they could
be‘ removed surgically or treated
with radiation.

One researcher, Dr. Joseph Ra-
gaz of the Cancer Control Agen-
cy in Vancouver, British
Columbia, said he believes wom-
en with smaller tumors also will
benefit from early chemotherapy,
and drug treatment before sur-
gery might someday become a

So, manipulation of en-

tor in detemining effects to

He projected that, 10 years af-
ter their diagnosis, 30 percent of
the patients will be alive without

‘any evidence of disease. With

standard therapy, he said, only 10
percent or less of patients survive

for five years, and virtually no

one lives 10 years.

Hortobagyi said giving
chemotherapy before the dis-
eased breast is removed provides
an important advantage;

’’In this strategy,” he said, ”you
can measure the effect of the
chemotherapy, because you still
have the tumor in place. When
it doesn't work, you can spare
them the side effects of future
chemotherapy.”

Of the 130,000 women -in the
United States who are diagnosed
with breast cancer ‘each year, 15

percent have cancer that is too _

advanced to be removed.

tute, researchers are treating these

The light therapy requires ad-

manufacturers for -use in the

home. They usually cost between .

Emergency helicopters
helpful in state parks

For the experienced and fit,
outdoor sports that come with the
warm weather are challenging
fun. For others, they can be dan-
gerous.

Last spring, that fun became a
nightmare for a 12-year-old Pitts-
burgh boy.

Spending the afternoon at a
state park with his family, the boy
dove into an area marked ”No
Swimming.” He was instantly
pulled under by the current_ and _
wedged beneath a rock.

State park rangers contacted
the local ambulance service, who
brought the boy to the nearest
hospital, which was 45 minutes
away. The boy died amid raging
controversy.

Trauma injuries are inevitable
in ‘areas such as state parks,
which attract a large number of
visitors. Many engage in poten-
tially dangerous sports.

The problem is compounded
by the rugged terrain, lack of eas-
ily identifiable landmarks and the '
often great distance to specialty
care hospitals.

Until recently, there were no’
designated landing zones for
emergency medical helicopters.

Allegheny Hospital's Life Flight
has developed’ emergency re-
sponse plans for the Pennsylvania
state, parks within a 60-mile
radius of Pittsburgh. °

.”We presented our proposal to
the state park superintendents in
July 1986 to designate official
landing zones and to assist in car-
relating this plan with their par-
ticular emergency medical ser-
vice by training both‘ park and
pre-hospital personnel in aero-
medical transportation,” said
Ruey Read, Life F|ight’s outreach
coordinator.

In many cases, park personnel
had no experience in designating
landing zones or giving instruc-
tions to helicopter crews. Poten-
tial sites were often unidentifiable
from the ground.

V ADVERTISERS
PLEASE

  

Training sessions were provid-
ed to teach park personnel how
to arrange for a Life Flight mis-
sion, types of patients transport-
ed by Life Flight, helicopter safety
and how to prepare a landing
zone.-

Areas designated as landing
zones were near previous acci-
dent spots or those with a high
volume of visitors. When desig-
nating a landing zone, it is imor-

g tant that the area be a flat part of

the natural terrain with no haz-
ards such as hanging trees and be
accessible by ambulance and
helicopter. One central zone was
designated for small parks, while
some of the larger ones required
two.

”From mid-July to October, we

-worked with the park superinten-

dents and rangers for 14 state
parks and four area dams. At one
park, it took us two hours to get

to the main camping site by truck -

traveling through dirt roads,
bumpy potholes, sloppy mud and
streams,” Read said. ”Most parks
were completed in one day, but

a few were so large that it toak ‘

several days to travel through the
park to some of the more remote,
high volume areas.”

The information obtained, lo-
cation of landing zone, land-
marks, navigational coordinates
and specific park hazards, is kept

in a special record for Life Flight '

dispatchers to use in the event of
a park emergency. The pilots
responding to the calls can also

_ be apprised of the information.

”We also keep track of specif-
ic information on each park. One
park, for example, has a 75-mile
run each July. By being alerted of
the activity, we are prepared to
respond in case of an accident,”
Read said. '

If an accidentocurrs, the park
ranger contacts the local am-
bulance and Life Flight. If the am-

bulance service can.handle the
situation, Life Flight will return to
the hospital, but if the accident is
serious, the flight is continued.

”Life F|ight’s program has also
been handy for our local town-
ship fire and police departments,
who'have used the landing zones
for highway accidents and emer-
gencies,” said Bob Hufman, park
superintendent at Laurel Ridge
Park.

”We decided to implement the
emergency program because, as
a major state park offering recrea-
tional activities such as hiking,
snow mobiling, water skiing and
camping, we realize the need to
be prepared in case of an acci-
dent,” Hufman said.

State parks are extremely«inac-
cessible, and that is why the
helicopter is advantageous. The
helicopter is very adaptable;
therefore, the landing zone can
be changed to accomodate the
injured.

Time and speed is also critical,
as well as getting the injured to

an advanced specialty care hospi- -

tal for appropriate treatment.
Life Flight responds within
three to five minutes to calls from
physicians, nurses, paramedics,
EMTs, police‘ and industrial safe-

ty personnel who have deter»

mined the patient’s condition to
be serious.

Education plays a major role in

Life F|ight’s service. Demonstra-
tions and seminars in the prepa-
ration and treatment of patients

are offered on a regular basis. 
These programs draw upon the.

expertise of Allegheny’s staff.
Life Flight staff includes 20

flight nurses, five dispatchers, six

pilots and three mechanics, as

well as a medical directorand "

‘outreach coordinator. All nurses
are registered and certified ‘in ad-.

vanced cardiac life support. They _ A "

lshtar gets stuck in the sand

It's a comedy, it's a
farce — it's a flop T

By Dave Zafris

’-“If you were planning on
seeing,/shtar, don't go into
the theater thinking it's going
to be funny. .

_ It's not'— .at least for the
most part, anyway. When-
ever I see a comedy, ‘I go in
with the distinct notion that I
will laugh. But _neither the au-
dience nor l laughed that
much. - ‘

' That's the first problem with -
this movie.

The film is about two song-
writers who have minimal to-

‘ lent. They can't find work

. anywhere in this country, and

 their agent offers them a gig ' '
in lshtar, a small fictitious
country lying between Moroc-
co and Libya.

While parts of /shtar’ may
seem funny at the theater, it is

. obvious that the film is really

grasping for laughs.

Dustin Hoffman and Warren
Beatty are disasterously cast.
- l don't know it Bill Murray
and Chevy Case could've
been funny with thisscript,
but Hoffman and Beatty don't
have a chance. They don't
mix, they don't gell, and they
seem too old for the ‘
characters.

Warren Beatty can't play
someone who's dumb. Not
that he's too intelligent to be
perceived as stupid, it's just
his demeanor. His breathy .
style of speaking makes it
sound like he's always on the
verge of making a scientific
discovery. Playing a slow-

enough to be persuasive, and
she has a foreign accent —

on the verge of either laugh-
ter or tears.‘ But the script

The,songwriters,'Chuck
Clarke (Dustin Hoffman) and )
Lyle Rogers (Warren Beatty),

meet up in lshtar with the
beautiful revolutionary Shirra
 V (lsabelle Adjani), who eventu-
?'- * ally draws them into a revolu-
 tion against the U.S.-
 supported government of
' lshtar. ' ‘
There are some genuinely
. humorous, it not side-
msplittingly funny scenes — like
when Warren Beatty is sup-
posed to say a secret code to
 a camel salesman, "l would
 -like to buy a blind camel,”

' and ends up actually buying
 one". The other salesmen try to
 sell an assortment of maimed
 . and crippled camels to the
 confused Beatty. —

 Another highlight is when
 Hoffman's character displays
 a lackof songwriting tact as
_.'. -he composes a song for an

 - elderly couple dining in a
'.,:,,restaurant while he's playing
 , the piano. _

[ He sings, /'m going to save
'."f_ ._a_/itt/e‘/ove for you in my will,
 probably the funniest scene
 '.of the movie.

Paskow, a trio of musicians
known_as The Washington
Squares.

The band's new self—titled al-
bum aptly shows off their con-
siderable vocal skill, enviable
ability to warmly blend their
voices and knack for combining

. a '60s sensibility with a modern,
vital sound.

With the active Mr. Mitch
Easter producing them, the

Livi n g a n
By Dave Zuchowski.

John Daniecki, a New Jersey
native, made his Pittsburgh
‘Opera debut last month in the
role of Arturo in Donizetti's Lucia
di Lammermoor.

In the spring of'8o, he partic-
ipated in the Pittsburgh Opera
Center, training in such diverse
operatic disciplines as stagin ,
dramatic interpretation, bo y
movement, diction, vocal tech-
nique and musical interpretation.

One of only six young singers
to be chosen from a field.of 80
candidates from across the na-
tion, Daniecki was taught how
to research an operatic role by

---«(Tito Capobianco, the Pittsburgh

Opera's general director.
"Developing a~role," he said,
"begins by reading the original
novel or short story onwhich the
opera's libretto is based. From
there, you have to determine
how the literary source manifests
itself in libretto form, taking into

\...\_account' how the characters’

personalities may have changed
‘in the transition from book to
libretto. ‘

"Much of the characterization
can also be inferred from‘ the
music itself, which, for Arturo in
lucia, is not as legato as it is for
the other characters. It involves
a lot of punctuated rhythms.
Arturo's vocal lines and accom-
paniment are much more rigid
and stentorian than for the other

. characters because he has a

harsher, more strident perso-
nality."

Before arriving for rehearsal
with the ‘Pittsburgh Opera,

./

' ‘ Daniecki had his own notions as

to how the role should be
played. But in rehearsal, his
ideas were blended with those
of the director to create .a more
composite personality.

’ Daniecki is pleased that he
was able to si'ng..the‘roIe ofAr-

turo in Pittsburg .

Squares achieve a rich, full--

bodied sound with a minimal

; number of instruments,’ the

maiority of them acoustic. ,
Backed by too long forgotten

-television drummer BillyiFicca,

the band's playing is feverish,
dynamic and full of impact, due,
at least in part, to Easter's unob-
trusively textured production.
But The Washington Squares
shine brightest when they start
singing. "You Are Not Alone”
sounds like a '50's’ ballad musi-

cally, but the song's real tender—.

ness and sense of acommunal
liberal spirit come from the soar-
ing vocal performances.

"D Train" . becomes a
memorable working people's
sing—a—long thanks to some fiesty
vocals on the oft’-repeated
refrain: / get up each morning at
the crack of 8  take a train in
a ho/e to a job I hate/Ridin' on
the D Train line.

If there is a flaw in their
presentation, it is that the band
sometimes settles too easily into

 

vague, peace-nik cliches (the
rain, the system).

They do better for themselves
when capturing the feel of the
Polish labor union Solidarity in
enlightening detail on the trans-
lated anthem "Walls" or when
they play a song capable of
numerous interpretations like
"He Was A Friend Of Mine."

Specifically, "Friend" is the
story of a bond between two
disparate people, but it also
works as an evocation for all the
world's homeless and forgotten.

The Washington Squares are

-a refreshing band, both stylisti-

cally and in the sense of sincere
commitment they bring to their

songs. In time, perhaps, they will i

write more songs on a more per-
sonal, focused level, but much of
what they already sing is still
powerful and rings true, as in
''New Generation:" love and
understanding a// covered in
dust//t's time for direction, caring
and trust.

opera role: research and inspiration

"The opera is a great piece
for me iust now because the
roles of Arturo and Edgardo are
ones that I plan to do for the rest
of my life.~. Typically, young
singers (will build their careers
with the lighter bel canto
repertoire.

"Later, by the time we're 35
or 40, we move on to the operas
of Puccini and Bizet. Then, in our
prime, we go onto tackle Verdi,
who wrote some of the heaviest
orchestrations of all the operat-
ic composers. Verdi's style
makes it more difficult to produce
a sound that can soar over the
massive orchestral music.

"One of the hardest things
that a young singer has to learn
is how to pace himself by not
singing too much or too often. In
my own case, I've been offered

Bohemes all over the country.
But I know that if I did more than
five Bohemes a year, my vocal
musculature could be irrepara-
bly damaged, and I might never

recover from the strain. But I'm <

fortunate enough to have two
mentors whose biggest bit of ad-
vice to me was to be patient and
not try to take on more than I am
ready for." ‘
Beginning -his music career at

‘ an early _age, Daniecki was _
- somewhat of a prodigy. It seems

that everything he touched, mu-
sically at least, turned to gold.

"I learned that I had an obvi-
ous musical ift when I started to
play the celo around 8 years
old. I learned to play it rather
quickly, and by the time I got to
high school, I had already per-
formed with several orchestras.

THE PITT NEWS

By Christopher Sepesy
Sports Editor ~

The much-heralded Panther
basketball recruiting class seems
to be experiencing some rough
waters at the moment.‘

Pitt recruit Marvin Branch, the
6-10 center from Barton Commu-
nity College in Great Bend, Kan-
sas, and one of the top junior

I college players in the nation, has

been formally released from his
commitment to Pitt, and instead
will attend the University of
Kansas. '

Brian Shorter, the star of the

Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of.

Wilson, Va, has not yet been able
to pass his college boards.
According". to Pitt assistant
basketball coach John Calipari,
Branch’s decision was solely per-
sonal, and he would not give any
definite reasons as to exactly why

‘it was made. However‘, Calipari,,

.

said Branch did know of Pitt's ex-
pectations of him when he made
the original commitment in April.

”When I was recruiting him, I
told both [him] and his family that
there were things he would have
to do in order for us to be able
to hold up our end of the bar-
gain,” said ' Calipari. ”Unfor-

tunately, there were some things

he felt he couldnit do, and there
were things he fell short on.”

The Pitt News was told by an
anonymous source at Barton
Community College that
Branch’s decision may be based
on his academic status: either that
he hasn't been able to attain the
academic status expected of him
until now, or that he has doubts
on whether or not he will be able
to meet Pitt's expectations if he
were to attend. *

Also, there has been specula-
tion that Branch was angered by
Charles Smith's decision not to

place himself into the N.B.A.
draft, thereby squelching a pos-
sible starting center position for
Branch on next year's squad._
But Calipari negates this.
”[Branch’s] decision has noth-
ingto do with [Smith’s],” he said.
Calipari also went on to say
that none of the players recruit-
ed this year will have starting
spots on next year's squad.
”We have several good people
coming next year, but we also
have five great returning starters
from this year,” said Calipari.
”Mike Goodson is the logical
choice for point guard, Charles
[Smith] at center and Jerome
[Lane], Rod [Brookin] and De-
metreus [Gore] filling in the rest.
”Yes, the recruits are very
good, but none of .them will have
starting spots,” he continued.
”They will be great back—ups, bar-
ring injury and what not, and will
help a lot with our depth, but

none of them will start.”
The problem with Shorter
seems to be a lingering one.

Shorter has already taken the
Scholastic Aptitude Test three
times and has not yet been able
to fulfill the basic score required
of him by both Pitt and the NCAA
under Proposition 48. -

He has registered again to take
the SAT June 6 and to take the
American, College Test June 13.

According to Oak Hill Acade-
my, he graduated -from_that insti-
tution this past Friday.

According to Calipari, Shorter
will definitely be able to play on
the ‘Panther team next year-

”Brian Shorter is a greatkid,
and he is far from being a dumb
kid,” said Calipari. ”He may
have put himself into some trou-
ble academically during the ninth
and 10th grades, but he has paid

lwedntesdoy, May .20‘, I987 .. 

Branch rejects Pitt, while Shorter Sits

his due, and he is ready for col-
lege, both athletically and,aca-_
demically.

”Personally, I think it's terrible . l

the pressures that are put on a kid
because of the SAT,” he con-
tinued. ”And .I really don't think
it's anyone’s~business but Brian's
what he gets on it.

V ”Put it this way: If he doesn't‘

pass it, he's coming to Pitt one ‘

way or the other.” -

With Shorter and the other four
recruits, the five starters men-
tioned above, plus Nate Bailey,

Marlon Ferguson, Chris‘Gatl'ing  M
and Pat Cavanaugh, Pitt will have

all of its 15 available scholarships

filled. ' S ‘
The 15th is Rich Carrigan, who

will be receiving a medical red-

shirt because of severe atropy in » P _
his -forearms, but he is still enti- - ‘

vtled to hisroriginal scholarship.

“By Christopher Sepesy I.

Sports Editor‘

Former Panther lineman
Steve Apke, overlooked in the
regular season draft, has been
given a chance to try out as a
free agent for the upcoming
season as a ‘member of the
Pittsburgh Steelers.

Apke, the 6-2, 215-pound .
linebacker from Cincinatti,
Ohio, said being able to play
for a professional team has al-
ways been one of his greatest
ambitions, and he is more

. happy than ever in getting this
chance with the Steelers.

”This is truly one of the best‘

things that has ever happened ‘

to me,” said Apke. ‘fl really
didn't think this chance would
come, but I'm really glad that
it has. Ithink I'll make it, but
just getting the opportunity to
try is great.” '
Apke said he feels indebted
to Pitt assistant linebacker
coach Sal.Su_n'seri, who, after
-the initial draft was over, made
several phone calls to various

order to get him a ch‘an_ce..

For The Pitt News

It is shaping up to be a busy
summer for a number of Pitt's
track athletes.

First, the Pitt track team will

’ travel to Villanova University to

compete in the oldest track champ
pionship in the country, the
IC4As.

Pitt men's track coach John
Vasvary said a top five finish for
the Panthers is not out of the
question.

A number of Pitt's track team
members will also be competing
in important competitions around
the world this summer.

For world—record holder Lee
McRae events closer to home
have taken on added importance.

”The big, big thing in my life, ‘

this summer is that, for the first
time, my mom and dad will see
me run,” said McRae.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday May 20, I987

McRae is also looking forward
to the NCAA championships, the
Pan American Games, and the
World Games.

The possibility of a European
tour later in the summer also has
McRae excited.

McRae feels the major differ-
ence between the way he is run-
ning now and the way he has run
in previous years is his con-
fidence.

’’I had the talent before, but, in
fact, I did not have the confi-
dence,” said McRae.

Although McRae appears to
have a virtual lock on the title of
top U.S. sprinter, he said he feels
there are more than enough good
runners out there to challenge
him. Among these, McRae sees
childhood friend Floyd Heard as
his main competition in the up-
coming summer meets. _

Three other Pitt All—Americans

Pitt runners sprinting around the world

are looking forward to a summer
of competition.

The sights of Eric Cannon, Tim
Manes, and Dave Moore are set
on the upcoming |C4A champi-
onships. ' .

Manes, who runs in the 800
meter event, broke the school
record recently at the Pitt Invita-
tional.

The new record, 1:46.91,
breaks Pitt's oldest record, which
has stood since 1955.

Both Manes and another 800
meter runner, Dave Moore, have
qualified for the NCAA Champi-
onships which will take place
I-ater this summer.

Both have the chance to quali-
fy for the Pan American games,
which also take place later this
summer.

Cannon, a hurdler, has also
qualified to. compete in the
NCAA Championships meet.

Wrestlersto make several summerous

By Tarun Reddy

For The Pitt News

Pitt's All-America wrestler Pat
Santoro has been invited to com-
pete in an international tourna-
ment this summer in Sicily, Italy.

Santoro, a sophomore, sees
two bonuses in the upcoming
competition.

”The first advantage is getting

I the chance to travel to a different

country and experience different
competition,” said Santoro. ”It
should be a good learning ex-
perience.

”The second advantage is'get-
ting another chance to compete
and redeem myself after the
NCAA Championships,” con-
tinued Santoro. ”I was somewhat
disappointed with my perfor-
mance at the NCAA’s.”

_ Santoro finished second in the
142—pound divison at the cham-
pionships.

Santoro said that the upcoming
competition he will face in Sici-
ly will be a solid test of his skills,
since several top athletes from the
142—pound division will be par-
ticipating.

Looking further into the future,
Santoro said he would like to take
part in the 1988 Summer Olym-
pics in Seoul, South Korea.

Santoro noted, however, that
the weight classes are slightly
different in the Olympics and that
if he were to participate, it would
be in the I49—pound class.

Santoro. also expressed an in- -

terest in taking part in the .1992
games, at which time he would
be 25.

While one might wonder if 25
is a bit old to be an amateur wres-

. tler, Pitt wrestling coach Rande

Stottlemyer said that a wrestler
reaches his peak at that age.

Coach Stottlemyer sees Santoro
as a different kind of leader. ”San—
toro is someone who leads by ex-
ample, rather than by verbal
outbursts,” said Stottlemyer.

Two of Santoro’s teammates,
freshman Bill Lewis and sopho-
more Jeff Turner, will also see in-
ternational competition this
summer when they travel to

Japan and Seoul with the Athe- .

letes in Action group.

As far as the outlook for next
year's wrestling team, Stottlemyer
feels the team is Capable of an
even better showing than last
year's top-20 finish.

Among the reasons Stottlemyer
cited were the team's increased
maturity and better work habits.

”There is no guarantee for suc-
cess, but_the harder you work, the
better your chances are,”said
Stottlemyer.

”I felt Pittsburgh would give
him the best opportunity of

it's right down the street.”

he does not prefer either the
inside or the’ outside position,

After months of negotiations,-

Michael Spinks will defend his
world heavyweight title against
Gerry Cooney on Monday, June

15, at the.Atlantic City Conven- A
tion Center. --

The 15-round title bout is be-
ing promoted by Butch Lewis
Productions in association with
Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino,

T and it will be under the jurisdic-

tion of the'New Jersey State Ath-
letic Commission.

Spinks is guaranteed $7- mil-

lion, while Cooney willreceive.

a guaranteed $5 million. Lewis is
projecting a minimum gross of

‘$30 million.

Billed as ”The War at the

.Shore,” this m'atch—up will feature

an undefeated champion, who
has spent _a careerdefying the ex-

— perts, against achallenger whose

punching power has_been
described with the adjectives
”awesome”- and ”devastating.”

it is a pairing of David and

‘Goliath proportions. Boxer versus

puncher. Speed against power.

. Local boxing fans can watch
the fight live via closed-circuit TV

"in the Civic Arena’s half-house

set—up. One giant 15x20 foot
screen will be situated at the
north end of the building.

Viewers will not be able to
watch the bout at home. Arena
gates will open at 8 'p.m., with
preliminary bouts beginning at 9
p.m.

Spinks, the 30-year-old un-

I defeated champion (30—O, 20.

KOs), has parlayed ring sawy, an
unorthodox style, his famed
”Spinks Jinx” and an explosive
overhand right into world cham-
pionships in two weight classes.
Each time he“ has beaten the
odds

The St. Louis native, who now
resides in Delaware, burst onto
the worldwide scene in 1976
when he upset Russian Rufat
Reskiev to win an Olympic Gold
Medal.

Five years later, he knocked
down favorite Eddie Mustafa Mu-
hammad en route to a unanimous
decision victory for the WBA
Light Heavyweight title.

in a March 1983 unification
fight, Spinks outpointed Dwight
Muhammad Qawi to become the
undisputed 175 pound champ.

These accomplishments would
prove to be mere appetizers for
Spinks. The main course came on
September 21, 1985, when, as a
heavy underdog, he shocked the

- sports world by defeating the

then unbeaten heavyweight
champion Larry Holmes to be-
come the first light heavyweight
champion ever to win the most
coveted crown in boxing.-

Six months later, Spinks out-
thought and out-fought Holmes
again to retain his title.

Against European champion
Steffan Tangstad in September
1986, Spinks proved his punch-
ing power could take the starch
out of a full-fledged heavyweight

Cooney, 28-1 with 24 knock-
outs, has been best known for

career: incredible brute force —
and inactivity. But once in the
ring, Cooney is as dangerous a
fighter as they come. - '

The 6-7, 232 pound Hunting-
ton, N.Y., giant is the possessor
of a murderous left hook that has
stopped eight opponents within
one round and 14 inside four.
Veterans Ron Lyle, Ken Norton

and Eddie Gregg all fell in the

first, and it was Cooney’s _'

54-second annihilation of Norton
that earned him a shot at the then
champion Larry Holmes.

After recovering from a second-
round knockdown, the 30-year-
old Irishman battled closely with
Holmes before tiring in the 13th
round, when the fight was
stopped.

Against Spinks, Cooney doesn't
plan to make the same mistake of
attempting to pace himself for the

-distance, as he did against Hol-

mes. He promises to take it to the
champion from the opening bell.
