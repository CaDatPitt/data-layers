TOTAL $38,700

In a one—hour bond sale on the
campus on Liberty Day the Women’s
Liberty Loan Committee of the Uni-
versity sold $4,600 worth of bond-s,
thus raising‘ their total sales to $38,-
050. On Saturday the total amounted
to $38,700, almost twice the ~arn_ount
of last year’s sale of $21,050". The
purchase of $1,200 in Liberty Bonds
by Minnesota soldiers stationed here
was a feature of the Diberty Day sale’

Liberty Day was celebrated at P-itt

by a “liberty hour” from 10:30 to
11:20. The students, who gathered
in a crowd on the campus, were
treated to a patriotic concert by the
student band. Subscriptions to the
Third Liberty Loan were taken by
a co-ed committee at a booth on the
campus. Large placards announced
the ever-rising total.
v As a ﬁtting close to the celebration,
an army aeroplane appeared i'in the
sky, ﬂying high over Oakland. The
machine was recognized to be the
visiting plane from the VVright ﬁelds
at Dayton, Ohio.

Miss Thompson spoke on the war
phase of 'pI‘Ol1|l'blltlOIl, urging it as
prime necessity for economy in ‘food

so conclusive that the judges were
unanimous
Thompson for ﬁrst place.

As a result of her victory, she has

SERVICE TAKES
MANY ENGINEERS

Last year the prospective mem-
bership o-f the engineering class of ’l8
amounted to» ﬁfty men. Of this num-
ber twenty-nine have either enlisted
in -the service of their county, or are
-awaiting a -call to one or the other

 

of ‘the great technical training camps
scattered thoruvghout the United
States.

H. H. Martindale, the representa-
tive of the school at the engineer
officers’ training school, leaves to-
morrow. J. E. Albert, Roland Wel-
don and J..P. Frazier are awaiting
orders to «go into aviation, as are
also Sleek, Ellis and Cole. Allan
Cole is a captain of cadets at the
University. The men will probably
go to the Connell aviation school.

West is at eGorgia Tech in the
ground school. Gibson, Corbett,
Ferguson and Levy are expecting a
summons to the enlisted engineers‘
reserves. Weinmian is ltjraining at
San Antonio, Texas, with one of the
flight squadrons. Horning and Peters
are at College Park, Maryland, tak-
ing radio instruction. Ferguson and
Sleek are at present engaged «in sur-
vey work of the local rivers under
Colonel Stickle.

Of the men who remain at school
two have families and the rest have
been rejected by the recruiting of-
ﬁcers because of physical defects.

Three well

racks, Cape May, N. J., have passed
their preliminary examinations for
ensigns and are in Pittsburgh this
week. One of the purposes of their
trip home is to stimulate recruiting
in the naval reserves at the Univer-
sity. A tent will probably be erected
on the lower campus with these men
in charge. ‘They are not planning to
get actual enlistments-—rather their
idea -is'to explain -personally to those

_who are ﬁguring on su-eh service just

what advantages it offers for college
men.

The naval reservesjiwhich they rep-
resent, have far outgrown the orig-
inal title of “Mosquito Fleet.” Its
men "are found all over the world and
all types -of ships number Reserves

At the -present time
is a real demand for ofﬁcer

the preference. Men who make good
in the preliminary training may be
given district commissions at once

or are sent to Alnnapol-is Naval
Acadmey where they have an oppor-
tunity to win the regular Navy an-
chor and beco-n1e a line ofﬁ-cer in the
Navy for the duration of the war.
Naval reserve, armed guard crews
afford_ protection of transports
against the submarine dangers. Sev-
eral Pitt men have recently gone -out
in armed guards, among these are
George Stewart, Eng, and Gus Asch—
man, Ec., they being petty officers of
the ﬁrst crews that left Wissahickon
Barracks. At Wissahickon Barracks
there have been numerous Pitt men
and Pelham Bay and the Philadel-
phia Navy Yard have also had their
share of Pittites.

Willison, Lulbic and Koch repre-
sent the highest type of Pitt men and
their presence here is sure to stir up
enthusiasm in this particular branch
of the service. Willison was presi-
dent of the student senate last year.
Lubic is a former basketball captain
and star. Koch was a member of
the Varsity track squad for several
years.

Pitt’s relay team coverediit»

the Saturday and
climbed to the top rung on the

country

off all the big events at the Penn
relays at Philadelphia,‘ due
_largely to the wonderful run-
ning of Frank Shea, national
quarter-niile champion- The
Panthers captured three relay
events, the national college re-
lay championship, the Class B
championship,‘ and the sprint
medley. Capt. Jock Souther-
land kept pace with his pro-
teges by capturing two ﬁrst
places, in the 56-pound weight
and the discus throw.

She-a was the hero of the meet
and, runningunder a. big handi-
caip-, seemed to bring out the
best that was in him. In the

layed a short time when an-
other runner, who had just ﬁn-

f When he got clear Shea 
st’—?a?rted*~ 

sourian and gradually cut down
the distance between the two.
When less than three-quarters
of the distance was run Shea
had closed up. The Missouri
runner was determined not to
be beaten out, and gave the
Panther star -a big ﬁght, but the
Irwin High lad beat him to the
tape. Shea. was clocked at
48 3-5, two-ﬁfths of la. second
better than -he did an hour be-
fore in the Class B race.

In the Class B relay Shea
started under an even" bigger

‘handicap, being touched off 30

yards behind the ﬁrst man,»who
wore the Columbia colors. Shea
was off at once and soon closed
the intervening distance. There
was not much ﬁght to the Co-
1,umbi.a-man, and Shea took it
easy the rest of the way, ﬁnish-
ing in good condition.

On’ Friday, the first day’ of
the relays, the Panther team
won its ﬁrst victory by captur-
ing the. sprint medley in 3:37
4-5. Peters and Speck each

can 220 yards and Shea was
third, running a quarter in 49 2-5 sec-
onds. He gave Albright a slight lead
over the ﬁeld and the Massillon la-d
kept the lead, though Irvin of Penn-
sylvania pressed him hard. Albright
stepped off the half mile in 2:011-5.
The relay team did not ‘run in any of
the other events. , ‘

 . Commencement Banquet

atl-lotel Schenley May 311

In.£ormalA'ffair and A11 Pittites
Invited——Seniors Get Weekly
‘Fare.

RATE IS_ Two DOLLARS

. Plans for the Commencement
~ activities at the University-have
been completed and between
n-Ow and Commencement Day,
May 31, the alumni Office will
be busy with the many details
_,incident to them.
- The big affair is, -of course; the ‘an-
;"nual Alumni ,-Comm-encemeiit ban-
quet. After a .con'feren-ce with the
i_University authorities it was decided
that notwithstanding existing. war
c.O’ndi-‘tions the banquet should be held.
‘It has .always been a ﬁnal social
vfea_t1_1.re connected with the annual
' -Comrnencement exercises and all who
[have attended. past banquet-s h‘ave.e~n—
jioyed them immensely. T-he Enter-
itainment Committee. plans a good
program of -speakers who will talk
on. subjects relatin-g to the war and
_ the 7part the University is playing
@"’1i‘n‘i't._ ' ' i A
‘About the middle or May s-pecial
-notices will be sent to all the alumni
.in,tj_his district "telling «of the banquet
and having a -card attached which

_ should watch 'for_-this notice and send
in -Orders with check t-he minute it
is -received. This enables the sec're_-

- J t.-ary -to give the hotel -a guarantee on

V the number likely to -attend. It is

i” I not an ir1v.ri'ta~ti~onlaﬁ"air, however, and

through inac-curacie-s in It-he mailing

list so-me may not get notices.’ They

_can,me"rel-y send in the order ‘by let-
 ter, with check. All Pittites are wel-

/ i. come. With ‘so -many alumni gone

,*it is all" the harder this year to make

an es-timate On?-the a-t_ten~dance and

 the ‘:0-Operation of alumni is asked.

All tho-se who are at home should at-

"t.en-d;:if'possi'ble. and they s-hould ad-

‘vise promptly that theywill attend.

. A __ - -T_O BE INFORMAL

record was 3:302-5 seconds and the
