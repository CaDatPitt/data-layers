Students give back

Abbey Reighard

Although most Pitt students used
Monday’s holiday to sleep in, others
saw Martin Luther Kingjr. Day as
a chance to give back to the com-

munity.
More than 600 students ﬁled

into the William Pitt Union Ball— .

room yesterday at 9 a.m. to par-
ticipate in the Martin Luther King
Jr. Day of Service. Duringthe annual
event, people across the country
volunteer on their day off from
work in honor of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. The commemorative
service day’s motto is “a day on, not
adayo .” g T
Pitt’s Student Volunteer Out-
reach, an organization that pro-
motes student participation in
community service, sponsored
Pitt’s involvementinthe MLK Day of
Service. SVO’s MLK Day of Service
Committee organized the event,

at MLK Day of Service

through which Pitt students par-
ticipated in local service projects.
According to committee chair

Janard Pendleton, there were more .

than 25 volunteering locations.
Some of the service sites were
the Greater Pittsburgh Commu-
nity Food Bank in Duquesne, Pa.,
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical

Gardens in Oakland, Seneca Place I

in Penn Hills, Pa., and the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs located
Downtown. Pendleton called it a
“nice mix” of organizations.
Pendleton, a graduate student
pursuing a doctorate in adminis-
trative and policy studies, said the
service projects at each location
varied. Students sent to the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs met and
spoke with veterans about Martin
Luther King Jr.’s lasting inﬂuence
and legacy. Students placed at the
Greater Pittsburgh Community

According to Pendleton, about
650 students volunteered at MLK
Day of Service, a signiﬁcant increase
from last years 500 volunteers.

Pendleton said that he believes
college students play a major role
in moving communities forward.

“Itwas college students working
hard to elect our president,” Pend-
leton said. “It was college students
during the Civil Rights Movement,
white and black students who were
working together diligently so that
everyone could have civil rights.”

Kylea Covaleski, ajunior psy-
chology major, spent her “day on”
crafting greeting cards for men and
women in the armed services.

“When I heard about [MLK Day
of Service], I thought it would be a
good opportunity to do services for
the community in and surround-
ing Pittsburgh,” Covaleski said. “It’s

Appeals court strikes

Gideon Bradshaw

Senior, Stcyff Writer
A Pennsylvania appellate judge
ruled Friday that a law requiring
voters to show photo identiﬁcation
at the polls is unconstitutional.

Judge Bernard McGinley of ,

the Commonwealth Court ruled
that a revision to the state’s elec-

tion code commonly called the.

“voter ID law” threatened “the
franchise of hundreds of thou-
sands of registered electors.” Sev-

 

eral public—interest groups jointly
ﬁled a challenge against Gov. Tom
Corbett and Secretary of the Com-
monwealth Carol Aichele in May
2012, only two months after the
Pennsylvania General Assembly
approved the bill.

The ruling reﬂects a nationwide
trend, coming at atime when both
Texas and North Carolina are fac-
ing scrutiny over their own simi-
larly restrictive and currently ac-
tive voter ID laws.

down Pennsylvaniavoter ID law

Under the law, introduced in
early 2012 by Republican Pennsyl-
vania Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, voters
were required to present accepted
forms- of ID — such as state and
U.S. government-issued driver’s
licenses or photo IDs and IDs is-
sued by universities and colleges
in the state —— at the polls to vote.
The previous law required voters
to show ID when they voted for the
ﬁrst time in an election district,
but allowed them to present non-

I 
1

photo forms of identiﬁcation after
the ﬁrst time. ,
While Republicans who pushed
for the law argued it would reduce
voter fraud, critics said the law
would disenfranchise poorer resi-
dents. The critics, includingDemo—
cratic lawmakers and civil rights
advocates, argued that it unfairly
targeted certain groups of voters
who were less likely to hold state
driver’s licenses or other approved
IDs. These groups included young

voters, the elderly and the poor,
among others.

During hearings held as part of

last July, Bernard Siskin, a statis-

than half a million eligible Penn-
sylvanian voters did not have any

the law. Diana Mutz, a political sci-

VOTING

Pennsylvania, said during the hearings that
although the state government conducted a
campaign to educate voters about the law, it
failed to correctly inform voters about the
requirements of the law.

McGinley sided with the groups that
ﬁled the suit, which included the American
Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, the
Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia,
the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People and several other
advocacy groups.

“The right to vote, fundamental in Penn-
sylvania, is irreplaceable, necessitating its

protection before any deprivation occurs,” .

McGinley wrote in his decision.

Although the Republican-controlled
state legislature passed the law before the
2012 presidential election, a commonwealth
judge said poll workers could not prevent
those without approved IDs from casting
ballots. W

Reactions to the ruling have been split
along party lines.

Pratt Wiley, the director of voter protec-
tion for the Democratic National Committee,
said the ruling would protect voters from

disenfranchisement.

“This law should never have been en-
acted, and Democrats remain committed
both to electing individuals who support
expanding access to the voting booth and

- -to supporting efforts to reverse burdensome
voting laws like this one across the country,” .

Wiley said in a statement the Democratic
Party issued after the ruling.

Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Squirrel Hill, called
the ruling a “victory for Pennsylvanians” in
a statement.

Rob Gleason, the chairman of the Re-
publican Party of Pennsylvania, said in a
statement that he was disappointed with
the ruling.

“The overwhelming majority of Pennsyl-
vanians support a way to protect their right
to vote and combat voter fraud,” Gleason
said.

Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, who introduced the
bill in 2011, was unavailable for comment
Friday afternoon.

Although McGinley declared the law un-

. constitutional; the state’s attorneys may still

appeal the case to the state’s Supreme Court.
“We continue to evaluate the opinion and
will shortly determine whether post-trial
motions are appropriate,”]ames Schultz, an
attorney for Corbett, said in a statement the
govemor’s ofﬁce released after the ruling.

- much easier to help the community when you

ﬁnd out about one of these bigger events, and
I feel like it’s really great, too, because it brings
together a lot of organizations from Pitt.”

While many students took buses to their 

designated areas of service, Covaleski joined
a group of almost 80 students who were as-
signed to the Kurtzman Room in-the William
Pitt Union to make greeting cards for mem-
bers of the armed services and the elderly.

The room was ﬁill of students crowded
around tables covered with stacks of color-
ful handmade cards. Students wrote jokes,
poems and-words of encouragement in the
cards. ; ’ S '

Julia Korenoski, a senior psychology

major, said she really enjoyed making cards
for members of the armed services and the
elderly because she said itallowed her to “re—
lease her inner child while helping out th
community.” - R -
The cards for overseas U.S.  mem-
bers will be sent in care packages and distrib-
uted by volunteers from Operation Stars and
Stripes, a nonproﬁt volunteer organization
that seeks to support active-duty personnel,
reserves, national guardsmen and women,

veterans and their families by sharingwords
of support through handmade cards.’

Students also made Valentine’s Day cards
to be distributed to local senior citizens by the
Meals on Wheels~Association of America, an
organization that delivers meals to the elderly.

' Samantha Barley, a junior psychology
major, said she enjoyed making cards as her
MLK Day of Service project.

“Ithinkthe cards could really bringasmile
to someone’s face and light up their day,” Bar-
ley said. “Just getting a card from someone
and knowing that people care about what
they're doing and what’s going on in their life
can have a really positive impa ” V

Pendleton said organizing the MLKDay of
Service took a lot of time and effort. The com-
mittee faced challengeswhen trying to locate

' {organizations that were open on the holiday.

Pendleton said his experience as commit-
tee chair was rewarding, and he was happy

_ the turnout. He said he hopes to add
‘ ‘more volunteer‘ sites throughout Pittsburgh
T and have a higher student turnout for next

year’s MLK Day of Service. I . ,
“Getting students involved and having

« them go to places and give back is part of our

EDITORIAL A, V A COLUMN

  
 
  
   
  
  
 
  
  
  

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

As much as I dislike most of the
policies Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Corbett has proposed and passed,
there is one thing he has done
that I do like a lot: He has revi-
talized the discussion on liquor
privatization and has laid out a
plan that could change the state
for the better.

I’m not a fan of this just be-
cause it would mean easier access
to alcohol, but because the state-
run system is completely broken
and archaic.

For instance, the tax on wine
and spirits here in Pennsylvania
came about as a reaction to the
' great Johnstown, Pa., ﬂood in
1936. The Johnstown Flood Tax
— as it was aptly named — was
used to help rebuild the devas-
tated city. And it worked: Taxes
acquired from the consumption
of alcohol helped rebuild the
city of Johnstown decades ago.
However, the Johnstown Flood
Tax, retaining its name, still ex-
ists today, and it currently costs
taxpayers of the state more than
$160 million each year.

That could rebuildjohnstown
10 times over. '

Granted, the money collect-
ed from this tax today could go
toward some great things. Not
only could the money help fund
ﬂood insurance for unfortunate
towns, but it could also beneﬁt
state infrastructure, social pro-
grams and education. Unfortu-
nately, it doesn’t. The majority
of the money made goes back

I  1 , . ; m a



 

sylvania Liquor Control Board,
which functions like any other
company but without the worry

into the pockets of the Penn-'

of competition.

Pennsylvania Wine & Spirits
stores generated approximately
$2.2 billion in sales in 2012-2013,
and approximately “70 percent
of the PLCB’s revenue is spent on
the purchase of wine and spirits

» and the transportation and ware-

housing costs associated with the
distribution of the product,” ac-
cording to their website;

Yet despite the monopoly over ’

this highly demanded product,
the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board has been in debt for the
past three years. In the 2011-
2012 ﬁscal year, this debt reached
more than $9 million. Perhaps
this is because the money the
board collects from taxpayers
and consumers goes toward pro-
moting alcohol consumption and

at the same time also goes toward 7

an education campaign against it.

One quick example: The board
spent $100,000 on creating an
iPhone app that compares the
cost of a bottle of wine in Penn-
sylvania to the same bottle in
New Jersey or Delaware. And
then the board invested in hav-
ing breathalyzers in every Wine &
Spirits store. The breathalyzers,
themselves, and the training that
came with them cost millions in
taxpayer dollars.

As a result, 61 percent of
Pennsylvanians are in favor of
ending the board’s control over
liquor sales. And rightly so, be-
cause aside from being wasteﬁil,
the board has also been histori-
cally marred by corruption and
scandal. For example, over the
past year, the agency has been
under ﬁre for the sale of eight
private, in-house brands of
wine and vodka that were pro-
duced in total secrecy and then

  Privatization of Pennsylvania’s liquor:
The better alternative to a broken system

sold in Wine & Spirits stores.
The board spent signiﬁcant re-
sources to promote these myste-
rious brands, and board CEO_]oe
Conti and other agency officials
offered inconsistent explanations
when the brand’s origins came
into question. This prompted an
expensive internal investigation
into the board’s activities by the
State Ethics Commission. Fur-
thermore, in 2012, the Philadel-
phia Inquirer released a report
detailing multiple high-ranking
board officials, including Conti,
accepting gifts from vendors. The
report noted that he and other
board members accepted invita-
tions to golf outings, tickets to
sporting events and free wine and
liquor: the same wine and liquor
paid for by our tax dollars.
Therefore, members abusing

l their power have undermined the

board’s intended role as an ethi-
cal regulator, which will hopefully
lead us to the privatization of li-
quor sales in Pennsylvania. Until
then, Pennsylvania is one of the
two remaining U.S. states with
an exclusive, state-government-
run monopoly on the retail sale
and wholesale (distribution to
bars, restaurants and hotels) of
wine and spirits, according to the
Commonwealth Foundation.
Some states that have priva-
tized liquor consumption have
made out lucratively. For exam-

» ple, the state of Iowa has estimat-

ed its-treasury to be $95 million
richer than it would have been
had it decided not to privatize
state stores in 1986, and due to
annual license fees and wholesale
markups, Iowa estimates that it
makes almost $15 million more

a year than it would have made had it not
privatized. 4

Accordingly, it is in Pennsylvaniais best
interests to follow in the rest of the coun-
try’s footsteps and ditch its dilapidated
system for the uncomplicated, and likely
more proﬁtable, alternative. The majority
of voters agree it’s just up to our elected
officials to ﬁnally do something about it.

To the Editor:

I am writing in regard to last Thursday’s

opinions piece by Natalie Russell, “Protes-'

tant work ethic leads to materialistic culture,
bad health.” This article, evidently inspired
by Max Weber’s 1905 text (without attribu-
tion), suggests that one of the greatest evils
facing America today is our industriousness.

This is an odd claim, and indeed this
piece continues Ms. Russell’s pattern of
choosing an unpopular-position and dem-
onstrating why no one attempts to defend

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

it. While the 250 word limit imposed upon
letters precludes a comprehensive autopsy
of the article (which I’d be happy to produce,
if invited), I shouldn’t think one necessary.
The conﬁision of the piece is self-evident,
and its shameless sophistry is so transpar-
ent that it would be insulting if iti‘weren’t
so hilarious.

Rather than a well-reasoned cultural
critique beﬁtting a Pitt student, this article
is the mere inarticulate shaking of a ﬁst at
what Ms. Russellhas previously called the
“exploitative capitalist system” that suppos-

edly runs. and ruins our lives. I understand
the temptation of such polemics: I ﬁrst read
“The Communist Manifesto” at age 12, and
if my middle school had a newspaper I prob-
ably would have written articles little better
than Ms. Russell’s. However, The Pitt News is
no place for such extremist arguments con-
ducted so badly. We are a leading university
in the greatest country on earth; let’s have
our newspaper reﬂect that.

"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit”
Directed by: Kenneth Branagh
Starring: Chris Pine, Keira
Knightley, Kevin Costner, Ken-
neth Branagh

Grade: B-

 

While Oscar—yearning hold-
overs from 2013 will entertain
the artsy crowds, “Jack Ryan:
Shadow Recruit,” with its com-
petent direction and endear-
ing sense of fun, will leave the
mainstream movie-going audi-
ence with more than the typical
half-baked schlock commonly

 

.-om.

found in theaters in the ﬁrst few
months of the new year.
Though it may be marketed
as a grand -action blockbuster
in which no presumed protago-
nists should be considered allies
to our lead, the actual product
is quite different —- a Cold War-
style espionage B-movie that at-
tempts to thrill with political
and economic themes as much
as car chases and gunplay. And
despite a decent number of plot
twists, the ﬁlm’s loosely drawn
and oversimpliﬁed characters
leave no doubt over the alle-
giance of our heroes and villains.
Ignoring the four previous
Jack Ryan ﬁlms (which were
not tightly linked, themselves,
and in which Ryan was played
by actors such as Alec Baldwin,

Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck),
“Shadow Recruit” acts as a re-
boot to the Tom Clancy—inspired
ﬁlm franchise. After a devastat-
ing helicopter crash, marine
Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) enters
physical therapy, where his doc-
tor and future girlfriend Cathy
(Keira Knightley) aid him in his
recovery. Once recuperated,]ack
is enlisted by Thomas Hooper
(Kevin Costner) to become a CIA
agent working undercover as an
analyst on Wall Street. After a
decade without causing much
trouble, conniving Russian vil-
lain Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth
Branagh) poses a terrorist threat
that could also involve a devas-
tating economic collapse of the
United States, forcing Ryan to
return to active service.

 

 

 

If the ﬁlm were executed
more sloppily, itwould be fair
to say that director and star
Kenneth Branagh was masking
the ﬁlm’s middling scale with
a thunderous score and cease-
lessly kinetic cinematography in
order to compensate for work-
ing with lackluster material.
However, given that the “Jack
Ryan” series is consistently en-
tertaining, it’s far more accurate
to instead praise Branagh for
his ability to do so much with
so little. The ﬁlm nestles com-
fortably between bombastic and
boring, effortlessly achieving
its own modest expectations as
simply a ﬁm thriller.

Despite showing no more
range than he did in the new Star
Trek ﬁlms, Pine makes for a ﬁne

‘rs--F"'”" ‘xx 3'’ ungzw -- - --. I - - A

        

lead and continues to prove him-
self a likable action star. Knight-
ley is perfectly acceptable in her
role, and fortunately her char-
acter is given more to do than
the usual worried love interest
or damsel in distress. Costner’s
character is uninteresting, and
Costner, himself, gives a per-
formance to match. Branagh
is easily the acting highlight of
the ﬁlm as a delightfully stereo-
typical Russian foe whose utter
campiness keeps things playful,
even in the midst ofjack Ryan’s
most serious moments.

“Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit”
is a colorful and unchallenging
excursion, laced with ﬂashes

Whether you’re a casual fan or a starry-
eyed fanatic who has followed the 64-year-
old rocker since the Asbury Park, N.J.,
days, there is one fact that can’t be denied:
Bruce Springsteen has certainly stood the
test of time. A ﬁxture on any classic rock
radio station and idolized by many in the
music world —— from punk rockers like
Ted Leo to jam band legends like Trey
Anastasio of Phish to country superstar
Eric Church, who released his ode to
The Boss, “Springsteen,” back in 2011 —
Springsteen’s inﬂuence can be felt across
a number of different genres.

From the heartland rock ‘n’ roll of

“Born in the USA” to the country—folk vibe
of “Nebraska,” Springsteen’s albums have
exhibited the same diversity as the scope
of his fanbase. In High Hopes, his 18th
studio album, Rage Against the Machine

‘ guitarist Tom Morello brings a heavier

feel to Springsteen’s sound — one that is
almost distracting. Although energetic,

the heavier distortion and metallic riffs ’

are overbearing and seem out of place
on a Springsteen album, especially for
those listeners that are used to hearing
E Street guitarists Steven Van Zandt or
Nils Lofgren. ' ’

It would not have been fair to expect a A

release that rivaled Born to Run. This lat-
est release is a collection of covers, along
with re-recorded versions of tracks from
former albums and concert set lists. Evi-
dently, Springsteen is focusing more at-
tention on touring nowadays than putting
out highly acclaimed studio albums. ‘
On his website, Springsteen described
his new album as a collection of his best

unreleased material from the past decade
or so. But considering what a lackluster
decade it’s been for the rock legend, those
words ring hollow. Nevertheless, “Frankie
Fell in Love,” the seventh track on High
Hopes, is worthwhile. A lyrically light
love song written’ Springsteen circa
the Darkness on the Edge of Town era, it
does well to remind fans of the "striking
quality of his work fromthat time-‘—pe,riod.

the same type of raw energy Springsteen

the list of noteworthy revived originals,
and although it was a noble ‘effort to cut a

Springsteen’s vocals sound far—fetched,
even synthesized, in this studio cut, and
display none of the depth and honesty with
which he sings in the live performance.
“High Hopes,” the title and leadoff
track, is an intense cover of a song ﬁrst

SPORTS

WEEKEND RECAP

Olympic sports all see success in weekendaction  

Dan Sostek
Staff Writer

It was an eventful weekend for the Pitt
varsity sports teams. Both the men’s and
women’s basketball teams fell to Syracuse
in close matchups, while the Pitt wres-
tling team upset the ﬁfth-ranked Okla-
homa State Cowboys. But there were three
other teams in action this weekend, and
all three fared quite well.

Track and ﬁeld

For the second weekend in a row, the
men’s and women’s indoor track and ﬁeld
team trekked to State College, Pa., this
time to compete in a series of individual
competitions as part of the annual Nit-
tany Lion Challenge.

The highlight of the meet for the Pan-
thers came when Carvin Nkanata broke
the 400—meter dash meet record with a
time of 46.36 seconds, tying the NCAA
record in the process.

Along with Nkanata’s impressive
achievement, sophomore Evann Thomp-
son set the women’s school record in
the 600-meter dash, securing a time of
1:30.98, more than two seconds faster
than the previous record. The Panthers
also saw Cayla Del Piano bec_ome the ﬁrst
Pitt women’s runner since 2005 to run
a sub-ﬁve-minute mile, ﬁnishing with a
time of4:58.60.

Coach Alonzo Webb was pleased with
the results.

“Overall, it was a really good meet for
us. We’re moving in the right direction,
and we’re doing the right things,” Webb
said. “I was impressed by how far along
some of the athletes have progressed so
far this season.”

Gymnastics ‘ .
The Pitt gymnastics team avenged
a loss from a year ago by defeating the
No. 25 Michigan State Spartans in East
Lansing on Saturday, 193.o25—192.525.

The Panthers were led by seniors
Brittney Harris and Katie O’Rourke, as
well as sophomore Lindsay Offutt. Harris
placed ﬁrst in the vault, O’Rourke tied
for ﬁrst on the beam and Offutt won the
ﬂoor exercise (O’Rourke placed third in
that event, as well). All three won those
events for the second consecutive week.

Despite describing the victory as “a ,
nice road win, but not a pretty win,” head ’
coach Debbie Yohman was content with

the meet, particularly with her three ﬁrst- A’

place ﬁnishers.

“Brit [Harris], Katie [O’Rourke] and
Lindsay [Olfutt] pretty much owned their
events once again,” Yohman said. “As: a
team, we just keep getting better little
by little, day by day.”

Swimming and diving

Both the men’s and women’s Pitt swim-
ming and diving teams enjoyed impres-
sive performances on Saturday, as the
men defeated Denison 226-74 while the

two split-squad women’s teams defeated
Denison 237-63 andjames Madison 167-
133 at Trees Pool.

The Panthers had tremendous success
all across the meet, but particularly in
diving. Sophomore Samantha Winkel-
mann won the 3-meter dive event, scoring
a 258.50, the fourth-best score for Pitt
this season. For the men, freshman Tony
Galante‘ and junior Harry Bergman won
3-meter and‘1-meter events, respectively.

“The divers did a tremendous job,”
said Pitt coach Chuck Knoles. “It was
really fun to watch them dominate the
boards.” ‘ 5 ‘ ‘

Other winners for the Panthers in-
cluded senior Veronica ‘Lee, who won
both the 100- and 200—yard ﬂy, junior
Danides Tombe, who won the 100- and
200-yard freestyle, and sophomore David

Sweeney, who won the 50-, 200- and 500- A

yard freestyle events while also being

~ part of the winning 400-yard freestyle

relay team. I

One minute and 23 seconds into his match
with Oklahoma State’s No. 8Josh Kindig,
Pitt freshman Mikey Racciato connected
on a reversal and ﬂattened Kindig’s shoul-
ders on the mat for what would be the
match—deciding pin.

“The pin was great,” Racciato said. “I
don’t even remember how it happened.”

Sunday’s match between No. 13 Pitt
and No. 5 Oklahoma State ended tied at
18. When a match ends in a tie, the ﬁrst
tiebreaker is total matches won. Since
the Cowboys and Panthers each won
ﬁve matches, the next tiebreaker is total
pins. Racciato’s pin was the only one of
the match and gave Pitt the bonus point
for the 19-18 victory.

match was just the beginning of the excite-

ment for the Panthers in their upset of a -

traditional powerin collegiate wrestling.

After losing the 125- and 133—pound
matches, Pitt faced a 7-0 hole. With two
freshmen coming to the mat in the next
two matches, it was crunch time for the
Panthers. ‘

At 141 pounds, Pitt’s No. 20 Edgar
Bright earned a 10-5 decision over No.
12 Anthony Collica.

Bright’s match was just one of a num-
ber of wins for the Panthers on Sunday
that they weren’t supposed to get. Pitt
wanted to prove to everyone that they
could compete with a top program.

“Our coaches remind us every day that
we’re working hard for a reason,” Bright
said. “I would say there’s a lot to prove.”

WRESTUNG

Unranked Racciato stepped to the mat
next and connected on his pin of his top—1O
opponent, giving Pitt 21 9-7 lead.

The underdog Panthers were only fa-
vored to win two of the 10 matches during
the day. Wins by the freshmen —- Bright
and Racciato — over higher—ranked wres-
tlers were a necessity for Pitt to come away
with a win. 6 '

“A win like that over such a prestigious
school is a great win for the team,” senior
P.]. Tasser said. “It really shows how re-
silient we are as a unit.”

Pitt needed to show its resilience
again after Racciato’s pin as the Panthers
dropped the next threeamatches, going
into the ﬁnal three matches of the day
down 18-9. '

Included in those three losses was a
tight decision for Pitt’s No. 8 Tyler Wilps.
Facing No. 2 Chris Perry, Wilps forced
overtime before losing 5-4.

The Panthers then had two winnable
matches with an opportunity to close the
gap in score.

No. 7 Max Thomusseit took care of
No. 18 Nolan Boyd 8-6, and No. 20 Nick
Bonaccorsi connected on a takedown in
the sudden-victory period of overtime to
earn a 3-1 victory. "

With the Panthers down 18-15, Tasser’s
matchup against No. 16 Austin Marsden
would decide the overall match outcome
for the Panthers. Going into the match, the
Panthers and their fans knew a decision
in favor of Tasser would earn the win for
Pitt due to the tiebreaking rules.

- The two heavyweights fought a close

 

and conservative match and entered the
sudden—victory'period of overtime tied
at one point apiece. In the one~minute
extra period, the ﬁrst wrestler to score a
takedown wins.

“It’s deﬁnitely a different mentality
going into overtime to win the match,”
Tasser said. “I knew I just had to stay
disciplined and wait for an opportunity.”

A double—leg takedown in the ﬁrst sud-
den—victory period for Tasser sent the Pitt
bench and_the crowd of more than 1,900
fans into a frenzy.

Pitt, which lost to its onlyother top—ﬁve
opponent this season in No. 1 Penn State,
has a schedule that includes some of the
top programs in wrestling.

The Panthers believe that tough sched-
ule hardens them for the stretch run of
their schedule into postseason play.

“It’s a great opportunity when a team
like that comes to wrestle us at home,”
Racciato said. “It’s great for our fans. Our
schedule is probably one of the hardest out
there, which can do nothing but help us.”

Tasser, an upperclassman who has
been through the rigors of a conference
schedule, a conference tournament and
the NCAA Tournament,“ backs up Rac-
ciato’s statements. V

“Wrestling a team of that caliber is
huge because those are the guys you are
going to see at N CAAs in March,” he said.

With the big nonconference win in
their belt, the Panthers must shift focus
back to making an impression on the ACC
in their ﬁrst year in the conference. Pitt
hosts Virginia on Friday at the Fitzgerald
Field House. . ' _ —

A “We have to turn the page and get ready
for Virginia onvFriday,” Tasser said. “That
match is just as important.” I
