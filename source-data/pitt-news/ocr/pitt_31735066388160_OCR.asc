German faculty  worried
about club's politics

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Faculty members of Pitt’s
Department of Germanic
Languages and Literatures say
they have received strong signals
throughout the semester that the
German Club was becoming
politically involved with a,
Pittsburgh “organization. As long
as those ties remained,
department members would
refuse to serve .as advisers to the
club. _

But the way some members of
the German Club, including
President Joe Weiss, see it, the
German department overstepped

.their bounds by delivering an
ultimatum during a meeting nearly
two weeks ago and making an
incorrect assumption that the
club's affiliation with the German
American National Congress
(DANC) was anything more tha
social and cultural. '

“[German department

’ Chairman Dr. Clark Muenzer] put

 

it in black and white. He said,
‘You either break all ties with

DAN C and stay with the German e

department, whereupon the
department will be more than
happy to assist you in distributing
information and recruiting new
members, or you can keep these
ties with DANC, and you will not
be sponsored by anyone in the
German department any longer, ’”
Weiss said.

Weiss added that he originally
contacted DANC about a year

ago to see if club members could

participate in some of the group’s
social functions, such as the
Oktoberfest and Gala Ball. It was
arranged that members of the
German Club could attend DAN C

‘ social functions at half—price, and

no mention of any political ties
was ever discussed. '

“T 0 us, it was the ideal way to
experience German culture. Since

‘we don’t get much assistance

from the German department,
and the Student Government
Board just provides us with
enough funds to meet our basic
everyday needs, we can’t pull off
the big social events we’d like to.

. So this was the way we found to

C.»

try and attract people to come
out and have a good time with us
 it was purely social and cultural
 they never approached us about
anything political,” Weiss said.
But Muenzer said he believes
the relationship between DANC
and the German Club had gone
way beyond just fun and games
and into the political arena, an
area that faculty members try to
avoid when sponsoring college
organizations. . '
“It was made very clear to the

 
 

students that the reasons for our
‘concern were that to our
knowledge, DANC, while
representing itself as a cultural
organization and certainly doing
many things that no one could
question them about, has a very
defined, strong political agenda,
even of an ideological nature,

and we didn’t think it was

appropriate for faculty. at a
university to support [the ties];
“It wasn’t my impression that
the ties [between DANC and the
German Club] were just of a social
nature,” he added. “People can
read things differently, and I think

that students with very good e

motives at times can become
associated with groups that they
aren’t entirely aware of what
they’re about.” *

Muenzer ‘said that the entire
German faculty met and decided

that none of them, including the-

current adviser, “felt that it is
appropriate for members of the
university faculty to be involved’
in a “student organization that
maintains links with a political
organization,” prompting the

Sept. 27 meeting between German _

department members
German Club officers.
.Muenzer said the German

and

department received warning"

signs of the German Club’s

political involvement with DANC I

when he saw advertisements for
DANC functions published in the
_Club’s newsletter last month.
“The advertisements solicited
donations to the organization.
[Weiss asked us] to distribute them
to the German classes,” said
Muenzer. “I was also asked by
Joe Weiss earlier in the term if the

department would co-sponsor a

speaker for the German Club.
When I asked for a little more
information about the speaker, it
turned it was a speaker DANC
brought to Pitt, who was
prepared, in my opinion, to
deliver a highly politicized
speech.”

Muenzer would not comment
on what exactly DANC’s political

beliefs are, saying that they were A

irrelevant to the conﬂict between
the German department and
German Club. However, Weiss
and German Club Secretary
Heather Conti both said that at
the meeting, Muenzer warned
them that DANC’s policies were
extremist. ‘ ,
“The opinion that I gathered
from Dr. Muenzer was that DAN C

has political leanings toward the _

right. He said.DANC has beliefs
along the Nazi lines and that they
support the greater German race
idea; they want all Germans back
together again,” said Weiss.

Move yourself out.”

For The Pitt News

Litchfield Tower A was
renovated this
continuing the university’s long-
range plan of renovating one
dormitory per year, according to
an administration official.

The renovation, which began
in May and was completed in
August, consisted of repainting,
laying carpeting instead of tile,
purchasing new furniture, new
lighting, and windows that‘can
be opened. I

“The feedback we have
received was good,” according to
Bob Robinson, associate director
of Support Services. People seem
to appreciate the carpeting and
movable furniture most of all.
“Students genuinely seem to like
it. It has a better appearance. It
gives them more ﬂexibility.”

Gil Borok, a ‘resident assistant
on the second ﬂoor, said, “They
did a great job. The fixtures in the
building were old. The rooms

The ofﬁcial seating capacity of David
Lawrence Hallauditorium is 800 people.
This limit was reached within 25 minutes
last night at a free sneak preview of Look
Who’s Talking, starring John Travolta.

At 8:45, a Pitt Program Council worker
shouted, “Ladies and gentlemen, we have
reached our maximum seating capacity.

According to Michael Maccarone, ﬁlm
chairperson for the PPC, scenes like this are
not uncommon, when the group offers free
screenings during the year. Though he noted
that “it A is impossible to keep ﬁgures” on

summer, V

early.”

 

had a lot more furniture in them
than they really needed. The
furniture they have now is really
convenient. There is more space.”
According to Robinson, the
renovation cost “approximately
$1 million.” The money to fund
the project was generated by
student room and board fees. _
The contractors for the job were
hired through a bid process. There
were 10 to 12 contractors used, as
well as a group of student painters.
The crews began with 70 people
but dwindled down to about 20
as the summer progressed. “It
was very easy to get a job
lpaintingl,” said Mike Pologruto,
a member of the student crew.
Robinson said, “there has been
a program for years to upgrade
one building per year,” with most
of the renovations clone during
the four months between the
winter and fall term._ “These four

,months are a limited amount of

time, and not all of the

A construction can be completed.”

‘This is why, according to

how many students are turned away, he
added that “It’s conceivably two to three ’
hundred, depending on how much publicity
the ﬁlm got on TV. I ’
“We usually don’t start [admitting people] 4
until 8:30, but we. had a large crowd by
-twenty after. We want to keep the crowd
under control, so we started to let them in

 

   

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News ,

Maccarone said that there will be another “'
free screening October 23, of Immediate V ‘
Family, starring James Woods and Glenn
Close, and there may be two more sneak
previews before the end of the semester.

University continues renovation
plan of one dormitory per year

Robinson, only three-fourths of
Tower B has been completed.

“Planning now is for next summer.

Tower B is the logical step at this
point [and a] definite possibility,”

said Robinson.

At this time, construction
workers are replacing the roofs
on the Schenley Quadrangle
buildings, hoping to ﬁnish the
roofs of Holland, Amos and
McCormick halls before winter.
Bruce and Brackenridge will be
completed as weather permits.
This is being done during the
school year to avoid an overload

of work during the, four summer a

months.

Robinsonsaid he is pleased
with the results of the renovation.
“The staff did an excellent job‘

V coordinating the renovation of A

Tower A.” He feels the students
appreciate the changes, as well.

“The fresh coat of paint makes I

you feel good about where you

Grants vital for engineering ‘faculty

By Chris Studebaker
For The Pitt News

An official from the University
of Pittsburgh School of
Engineering said that a $250,000
grant from a local gas company is
vital to the school’s recruitment
and ‘retention of outstanding
faculty.

“Gifts such ‘as these are critical

to our success in achieving and
maintaining our preeminence in
the field of engineering
education,” said Charles A. Sorber,
dean of engineering. “We are
delighted to have it,” he added.

The grant, which will support
an endowed professorship, was
made on behalf of the Peoples
Natural Gas Co. and CNG

Development Co., two locally‘

based subsidiaries of the
Consolidated Natural Gas Co.

The award is part of a five-year
commitment with Pitt in which
CNG will donate a total of
$500,000 to the School of
Engineering. The use of the other
$250,000 will be determined later,
Sorber said.

Gcmdbis birthday observed

By Phillip Gesue
For The Pitt News

He was called “Mahatma,”
meaning “great soul,” by the
people he liberated from
colonialism and civil war 42
years ago. On Saturday, the
120th anniversary of his birth,
the life of Indian leader
Mohandas K. Gandhi was
celebrated in the William Pitt
Union.

In keeping with Gandhi’s
peaceful memory, the Indian-
American Federation of
Pittsburgh kept the birthday
celebration quiet and reverent
of the accomplishments of their
greatest leader. Approximately
100 Indians and Americans,
wearing both traditional and
contemporary Indian dress,
gathered in the darkened
Kurtzman Room to quietly

remember Gandhi.

The celebration was staged,

in the words of B.D. Singh,
chairman of the I.A.F.P., “so
that all can know [Gandhi’s]
message is universal, not
belonging only to the Indian
culture. I

“His philosophy of politics,
as well, belongs to no one
government in particular, but
to all. All serve in Gandhi’s
name. He is a universal leader,”
he said. '

The ceremonies were
organized by Guernod Goyl,
chairman of the I.A.F.P.
Birthdays Committee, and
opened by Dr. Keith Brown,
director of Pitt’s Asian Studies
Program. Brown spoke of the
achievements
contributions of India.

The accomplishments of
both Gandhi and India were
also remembered by highlight
speaker S.M.D. Kamala,
director of the Gandhi Institute
in Washington, D.C.

on their part. They just assumed
we are politically oriented. But
we aren't partisan; we’re a cultural,
educational organization that
aims to foster friendship between
Germans and Americans,” she
said.

Regardless of DANC’s political
beliefs, Weiss said “ the real
problem isn’t what the German
department’s intentions were but

the way they brought them across.» 

“DANC has never approached
us politically, and I have never
made anything political of it. This
situation was made political by
the German department and no

Conti feels the same way.

4 But they made it sound like we

didn’t have a choice. The point is
that the German department was
getting really dominating. They

Soccer team loses to

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team dropped
its _record to 5-4-1 on Saturday
with an 8-1 loss at Seton Hall.

Coach Joe Luxbacher called
the game a disasterand compared
it to the Steelers’ S1-0 opening
season loss to Cleveland.

“It was one of those‘ games
where everything fell apart. There
was not just one aspect of the
game that was the reason for the
loss,” said Luxbacher.

Seton Hall, which is nationally .

ranked, fielded four All-
Americans against the Panthers.
Luxbacher tried to mark’ these
players man-to-man, using Heinz
Pak, Sam Lanza, Roberto Croce
and Scott Armstrong, and play
the rest of the field six on six.
“We thought, with a good effort,
we would give ' them a good
game. We got out of our game,”
Luxbacher said. ,
Luxbacher said four or ﬁve ‘of
Seton Hall’s, goals were bad plays

by_Pitt, such as back passing to.

goalkeeper Jay Kapusta, and -

getting caught up‘ moving too far
forward. ' I
“They caught us on every

mistake. We took too many risks
against this team,” he said.

Pitt used the same defense,
anchored by sweeper Nick
Liberati, that has not allowed a
goal in regulation time in the past
three games.

Seton Hall scored two goals in
the first few minutes and had a 3-’
0 lead at halftime. ..

The Pirates also scored three
goals in the last 10 minutes.

“They were trying torun it up,”
said Luxbacher.

. Panther freshman Huy Tran
scored his second goal of the
season when the Seton Hall
goalkeeper mishandled a crossing

A pass from Scott Alexander. Tran

tapped the ball into the empty

net.

Luxbacher said he wants the
team to learn from this loss, but
also to forget about it and regroup
for Wednesday’s game against
Carnegie Mellon. He saidldespite
Saturday’s game, the defense has
played well lately.

Luxbacher saidhe expects a
good game from Carnegie Mellon.

the year before. ,

Lady Panthers up end tougher

Weekend opponents, now -13-4

By Ron Ledgard and
Scott Campbell‘
Staff Writers ‘

After feasting on Robert Morris
and Duquesne last week, the
25th-ranked ‘Lady . Panthers
volleyball team faced some stiffer
competition at home over the
weekend against Rhode Island
and Wright State. T he Lady
Panthers were up to the task,
however, winning both matches
and improving their season record
to 13~'4. A ,

Friday night at the Field House,

Rhode Island entered the match,

having lost a ‘close five-game.
match against 16th—ranked Penn
State. Rhode Island is a young

and rising team, and their forte is A

defense, which the Lady Panthers
realized from the outset.

The first game started lwith
Rhode Island keeping within one
point of the Lady Panthers. Once
the game reached 5-4, Pitt turned
it on, taking 10 of the last 13
points for the win. The serving of
Julie Sheils and the defense of
Lori Silk and Michelle Adamson
solidified the victory. Several
quick sets by Janelle Lantagne
behind her back to Adarnson
surprised the Wrams.

The second game turnedinto a
defensive struggle, featuring

several long volleys. The Wrams’ P
Q defense effectively took Lantagne,

the quarterback of the offense,
out of the early part of the game.
Rhode Island grabbed an early 6-

s

 

4 lead. The jumpserves of Kengy
Gardner and Michelle Drerup
disrupted the Lady Panthers’ first

’ hits. According to Pitt head coach

Sue Woodstra, Pitt needsthose
first hits in order to be able to
pass effectively. After a time—out,
Pitt recaptured the lead but was
unable to burythe Wrams. Pitt
squeaked out a 15-11 win. It took
five servers for Pitt to win the
final point.

“They were playing very good
defense, "emotional defense, the
type of defense we’re supposed
to play.'They kept making us hit
ball after ball, which drained us,”
Woodstra said.

The third game was the Lady
Panthers’ first loss at home. Pitt
kept it close, 5-5, but this game
was controlled entirely by the
Wrams. The Wrarns captain and
only senior, Drerup, and freshman
Allison Irvine led the way with
their defense.

“I tried to change the tempo by
taking [Kelly] Matheis and [Lori]
Silk out to see if the younger
players could add some emotion
to the game,” Woodstra said. It
didn’t work.

Thefourth game was all Pitt.
Rhode Island really took
themselves out with a lot of
unforced errors. Once again, the
game stayed close until the five-
point mark. The Lady Panthers
rolled off 10 of the last 11,“sealing
the victory.

“This was

performance of the year. Playing

the weakest‘

 

at home and being the favorite
are tough situations to be in,”
Woodstra added, “Rhode Island
and [Pitt] switched roles tonight.
We are not used to being the

. favorite.” -

The next night, Wright State
pulled into town with a 9-4 record
and a squad that Pitt knew
virtually nothing about.

‘‘They’re trying to build a good"

team; they’re looking to beat some
teams that are ranked. ahead of
them; we’ll have“ to guard against

_ that,” Woodstra saidbefore the
’ match. ‘

Halfway through the first game,
it seemed as if Pitt had nothing to
worry about as they zoomed to a
12-3 lead. Sheils alone had five’
kills at that point, and Pitt was in
command. The Raiders mounted
a comeback, smashing balls off
and through Pitt’s front line, a
problem that would plague the

‘Lady Panthers all night.

Wright won three consecutive
points and came to within 14-9
until M atheis smashed a kill down
the line to ice the first game for
Pitt. _

The second game started much
the same as the first, with Pitt
opening up a 9-3 advantage.
However, several net violations
and service errors opened the
door for the Raiders, who won
four straight points and took a
15-12 lead. .

Two kills by Silk gave the lead
back to Pitt, and Denise MacAuley

The third game started out as a
nightmare for Pitt. Anything they
blasted over the net was returned
by the Raiders, frustrating the
Lady Panthers.

Wright held a 9-4 lead, scoring
six points in a row, but Pitt would
not give up a game without a
fight. The Lady Panthers grabbed
a point here, two points there,
and pulled to within two, 11-9.

The Raiders then fell apart,
hitting balls out and into the net,
and Pitt grabbed the lead for the
first time since early in the game.

“I think it shows a lot to come
back in’ the third game like that.
I don’t think we were ever
thinking that we_were out of it.”

THE prrr ms, Tuesday, October 10, 1989

said Lantagne.

Ironically, the Panthers clinched
the match when MacAuley and
Heather Hollands combined to
block a Raider shot, something
they had trouble doing the whole
night. A

“Our blocking was really off
tonight; we were making a lot of
errors at the net. That's kind of
uncharacteristic. We haven’t really
done that in the past,” said
Lantagne.

Woodstra was happier with her
team’s . performance Saturday
night, despite the errors, and was
not surprised that her team came
back to win the third game.

“I feel pretty confident, no
matter where we are in a match

 

or in a game,” Woodstra said

V Lady Panther Notes: This
weekend the Lady Panthers travel
to Bowling Green and Western
Michigan to play.

The Lady Panthers have already
defeated Western Michigan this
year at the Notre Dame
Tournament, but the Broncos
took the Lady Panthers to five
games.

“I think it’ll be a tougher match
than when we played them
before, since both teams will have
an opportunity to prepare; so
we’re going to have to change a
little bit," taid Woodstra.
