 

Transplant
recipients
plead case

By Jack Finn
Asst. News Editor

Emotional testimony by organ
recipients and donor families high-
lighted public testimony concern-
ing presumed consent for organ
donation.

The joint Pennsylvania Senate
and Hofuse-Judiciary Committee
held the hearing at Montefiore
Hospital on the legislation which
would encourage organ donations
by state residents.

“I am here not just as a wife, not
just as a mother with two children
who are waiting for their father to
rejoin the family, but as a repre-
sentative of a family who has
donated,” Joy Jewell said.

Jewell’s husband, Paul, is on a
waiting list for a heart transplant.
In 1982, their five-year-old son
died. ’

The cornea’s taken from their
son “allowed a 61-year-old man to
see again, to see the green grass
my son could not,” Jewell said.

The ticking of Paul Jewell’s heart
machine could be heard over his
wife’s testimony to the panel of
state representatives.

In closing her statement, Jewell
said she strongly supported the
proposed legislation and pleaded,
“please don’t keep us waiting.”

Senate Bill 794 has been intro-
duced by Sen. Michael M. Dawida
(D—Alleghney). The complemen-
tary House Bill 1956 was intro-
duced by Rep. Mark Cohen (D-
Philidelphia).

The legislation currently before
both committees would make
Pennsylvania the first state in the
nation to create a presumption
that its residents will donate
organs. The presumption could be
‘easily cancelled.

Dawida said non-donors would

Acknowledging that staff personnel at
Pitt “are our most important asset,” Vice‘
Chancellor of Business and Finance Ben
T uchi announced the creation of the
position of associate vice chancellor of
Human Resources.

A search committee is in the process
of looking at candidates to fill this new
position.

Director of Human Resources John
Wilds said he has accepted the newly
created position of assistant vice chan-
cellor for Employee Relations and will
report to the vice chancellor of human
resources. ~

Wilds will have five directors report-

rce reorganizoztiorn addresses uderstaﬁmg,

ing to him. They will be: director for
Workers Compensation, director for
Child Development Center, director for
Employee -Development, P director for
Labor Relations and director for
Employee Assistance Program. Allan
Boggs was named to head labor rela-
tions. Other directors have not been
announced.

The reorganization is in response to a
report issued by Ray Fortunato and
Associates, a consulting firm comprised
of human resource administrators at
universities throughout the country,
according to assistant vice chancellor for
Business and Finance Rhonda Gross.

I “Pitt is seriously understaffed com-
pared to other universities. The ratio of

Gross announced an increase of
seven staff positions at Human-
Resources.
A first-time audio/video hookup of

the Oakland campus and its branches ,

allowed Pitt officials to explain human
resource reorganization to Staff
Association Council members at their
meeting last Thursday.

The meeting, attended by about 400
SAC members at the William Pitt Union,
was linked by video to a similar meeting
at the Johnstown camp_us.

Audio hookups at Bradford, Titusville
and Greensburg allowed regional SAC
members to participate in the Oakland

Once again, ‘violence empt-
ed on the corner of Forbes
Avenue and Bouquet Street.

The shooting occurred last
night at about 11:00 p.m. out-
side the Original.Hot Dog
Shop.

The unidentified victim,
who witnesses and police said
they think is a member of the
Bloods, was taken to
Presbyterian University
Hospital, according to police.
The assailant, who was walk-
ing on Forbes, fled on foot
and remains at large.

Police said they suspect the
incident was gang related and
the assailant is a member of
the Crips from the Homewood
or Wilkinsburg area.

After the shootirrg,
Pittsburgh Police Sgt. J. Bolidi"
said, “Our primary function is
to gather all the evidence we
can and talk to all the witness-
es we can.”

However, many witnesses
refused to comment about the
incident, saying only that
someone was shot and that
the extent of the victim’s
injuries were unknown.
Officer P. Zilles said,
“Amazingly, no one saw any-
thing.”

Police suggested that the
late-night hours of the
Original contributes to the
escalating violence in the
Oakland area. “For years
[Oakland] has always been

stay that way for awhile,” Sgt-
Bondi said.

and update the employee classification
system.

Pitt students will share the
stage with senior citizens dur-
ing theater projects in the com-
ing school year, according to
Linda Deafenbaugh, director of
the Artist Resource Program of
Generations Together.

“They will have drama expe-
riences, which include sharing
of memories and storytelling, in
order to develop an intergener—
ational production,”
Deafenbaugh said.

Deafenbaugh said the ARP is

just one small part of
Generations Together, an
Intergenerational Studies

Program at Pitt’s Center for
Social and Urban Research. Its
purpose is to bring generations
together through volunteer and
mentor programs, ranging from
medicine and engineering to
law and art, according to
Deafenbaugh.

One ARP project uses ama-
teur and professional artists
over the age of 50 to teach art

techniques to students in
Allegheny County schools.

“We recruit and train the
artists, then they go to the
schools. We are continually
recruiting to enlarge our current
roster [over 130 in Allegheny
countyl,” according to
Deafenbaugh.

“The response has been
enthusiastic from the artistic
community. They share the
legacy of their own art. It pro-
vides another avenue for older
artists to enlarge the audience
for their own work and to
develop the next generation of
artists and art appreciators,” she
said.

According to Deafenbaugh,
an artist’s involvement can
range from one presentation to
weekly sessions.

“Student response is enthusi-
astic while their horizons are
being broadened,”
Deafenbaugh said. “Some
schools are enthusiastic about
using minority artists. This gives
students greater sensitivity to
different cultures while giving a

sense of pride to students from
that culture.”

Sometimes schools will sup-
plement an art education pro-
gram with community artists
who have special areas of
expertise.

It gives a dimension “to a
school's art program in a way
that a regular classroom art
experience couldn’t,”
Deafenbaugh said.

One of Pennsylvania's guide-
lines for art education is to use
commercial artists to help teach
students, according to
Deafenbaugh.

In one project, kids used
drum-building techniques to
create sculptures, using nails,
leather, string, wood and other
materials, she said.

According to Deafenbaugh,
the program offers internships
to Pitt students in the fall and
winter, particularly for those
with a communications, writing
or graphics background for
public relations work and a
visual arts background for festi-
val assistants.

Since 1986, the ARP has coor-
dinated an annual end—of-the-
year Intergenerational Arts
Festival.

The 20th Annual Senior
Festival starts the evening of

August 30. Sponsored by the
Allegheny County Department
of Aging, it will last through
Sept. 2 at the PPG Plaza down-
town.

Photos that were part of a
previous ARP exhibit will be
displayed.

“We want to raise the aware-
ness of intergenerational activi-
ties to encourage people to
incorporate these activities into
their lives,” Deafenbaugh said.
“We hope that senior citizens
will be inspired to volunteer
with children.”

These same photographs will
then be taken on tour across
the state to towns and schools,
according to Deafenbaugh,
who added that a national tour
is being planned.

The ARP, which has been in
Allegheny County for over a
decade, will be launched in
Beaver County, Deafenbaugh
said.

Surveys are being done this
summer to find older artists. In
the fall, training will begin for
art teachers and older artists.

Funding for the Artist
Resource Program comes from
school districts which pay a fee
and from companies and foun-
dations such as Westinghouse

potential transferee updated as
to the progress of their request.
“And the departments don’t
want to be fielding a lot of
inquiries,” Wilds said.

A Human Resource liasion
group consisting of 22 people
has been formed to assist Wilds

and Gross in the planned reor- ’

ganization process, according
to Gross.

Pay raises will be available to
SAC members beginning in
September, according to Gross,
and be retroactive to July 1.

When questioned as to why
some employees were paid
semi—monthly while others
were paid monthly, Tuchi said,
“The cost to the university to
pay all employees semi-month-
ly would be an additional
$20,000 to $40,000 a month.
Frankly, we don’t have the

money.”

Director of Transportation
Robert Harkins explained the
updating of computer software
to enhance ride-sharing at Pitt.
According to Harkins, one
potential incentive for ride-
sharing would be discounting
parking permit costs to those
who car pool.

Harkins also stated that
increased enforcement of park-
ing permits would begin in
September.

A change in the parking tick-
et appeals process was also
announced.

“Before, you had to pay the
$25 fine then wait on the
appeals process. Now, you can
appeal first and pay only if you
lose the appeal,” Harkins said.
But the university will be more
rigorous in collecting the out-
standing fines, Harkins said.

“Presently, there are 7,100
tickets outstanding at $25
each,” Harkins said. He is
investigating the ‘possibility of
payroll deduction for outstand-

ing tickets and delinquent park-
ing permit payments.

Harkins also said that SAC
members may ride the campus
shuttle system for free, whereas
students are charged $30 per
semester. “I don’t want the dri-
vers carrying money for obvi-
ous reasons,” Harkins said.

-The university is prevented
from issuing tokens or charging
by the ride under agreements
worked out with the Port
Authority.

The costs associated with
SAC ridership are paid for out
of Pitt’s general budget, accord-
ing to Harkins.

Parking fees will not increase
for permit holders in the
upcoming year, according to
Harkins.

In response to a question
concerning dental benefits for
staff, Wilds said Pitt is working
with the School of Dental
Medicine to develop a pro-
gram. -

Rosol will be stepping down
as president of SAC, although
she will remain a member of
the board as vice president of
communications.

Darlene Harris will be the
new president of SAC. Other
new officials will be Carol
James as vice president of
steering, Carol Kenderes as
business secretary and Larry
Mann as recording secretary.

Wilds presented Rosol with a
wood desk clock from the
members of SAC to commemo-
rate her work with SAC.

Rosol said her goal five years
ago was “to improve communi-
cations channels with the

administration and staff, and ,

this was accomplished.”

Tuchi said that Rosol “was a
pain in the neck, but an
absolutely delightful pain,
demonstrating leadership quali-
ties that would do any organi-
zation proud.”

be provided with stickers for their drivers’
licenses or separate non-donor cards. Their
names would also be entered in a computer
registry which hospitals would have to consult
before proceeding with a transplant.

“Survivors of Pennsylvania residents would
be asked if they want to change the presump-
tion that organ donations are authorized,”
Dawida said.

Paul Johnson, a kidney recipient in 1984,
told the committee that “a young fireman,
here in Pittsburgh, lost his life on the way to a
fire and saved my life.”

Denies Heidenreich introduced her 2 1/2-
year—old son, Steve, to the panel and
explained that he was a transplant recipient
when he was only five days old. She credits
the success of the surgery on the speed in
which a donor organ was found.

Richard Townsend, a trauma surgeon at
Alleghney General Hospital, told the commit-
tee that one potential organ recipient a day
dies in Pennsylvania waiting for an organ and
eight die every day nationwide.

John Fung, chief of transplantation at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said
organs available for transplant include kidney,
liver, heart, pancreas, lung and small intestine,

as well as tissue, skin, corneas, bone and ten-
dons. “A donor can affect over 300 recipients,”
he said.

Currently, there are nationally 30,000 peo-
ple waiting for an organ transplant and nation-
ally last year there were 4,500 organs donated,
according to Dawida. -

An emphasis on education of potential
donors and hospital personnel who must ask
potential donor families for the organs was
iterated by all those who testified.

Taimi Dunham told the committee how her
2 1/2-year-old son was struck and killed by a
careless driver, but his organs went to six
recipients and saved their lives.

Dunham said he strongly encouraged sec-
ondary school education on organ donation.
He said, “it is a gift from the heart.”

Dawida said he expects the bills to reach
the floors of both houses by the end of the
year

He said he felt there was strong support for
this legislation and he said he anticipated they
would pass quickly.

Tim Lynch whose wife died while waiting
for a lung transplant said, "Never in my life
would I have dreamed of waiting for holidays
because of increased traffic deaths -— they
were all potential ‘donors.'f

pass through their village, oth-
ers have been taken to deten-
tion camps and hotels which are
now used as military brothels
where they have been repeated-
ly raped,” she said.

The number of rapes has
been reported by the press at
between 20,000 to 50,000, she
said.

According to Longo, within
seven months, Amnesty
International had sent three
fact-finding missions to Bosnia.

“While the overwhelming
number of these rapes have
been committed against Muslim
women by Serbian armed
forces, all of the opposing sides
have committed such abuses,”
Longo said.

But Longo also said the issue
of soldiers raping women dur-
ing war is not something new
but that it has been going on for
years.

“We need to remember that
Bosnia is not, unique.
Remember the concentration
camp brothels where Jewish
women were forced to supply
enjoyment to their Nazi captors,
and the Japanese army use of
Filipino, Korean and Chinese
women as ‘comfort women’
during World War II, and the
mass rape of an estimated
400,000 women in the

Bangladesh-Pakistani war in
1971. The list goes on,” she
said.

Longo asked the audience for
help in the rape issue by con-
tacting U.S. and United Nations
officials.

She said that since the tradi-
tional Amnesty International
methods of 1etter—writing to an
abusive government have had
less effect because in countries
like Somalia and the former
Yugoslavia, “we really don’t
have a government to address,
and more importantly, we don’t
have a government to embar-
rass,” she said.

According to Longo, Amnesty
International will continue to
send more fact—finding missions
to document abuses, distribute
more reports and educate as
many people as possible about
the atrocities. I

“Most importantly,” she said
to the audience, “we will refuse
to remain silent.”_

Contacting U.S. and U.N. offi-
cials does payoff, according to
Longo.

She said that the U.N. has
developed a structure for ‘war
tribunals.‘ “The war tribunal
question is an important one,”
she said.

Since Amnesty International is
opposed to capital punishment,
Longo said it finds itself in the
ironic position of working to
commute the death sentences of
two soldiers convicted of rape
during the civil war in the for-
mer Yugoslavia.

Several of the audience mem-

bers said they were concerned
with the fight against the death
penalty in the U.S. and wanted
to know what the current status
of the situation was.

“The outcome is hard to
gauge. States are still executing
juveniles.

There is a very difficult strug-
gle ahead of us. [Recently] a
man on death row in Maryland
for nine years was found inno-
cent by DNA evidence,” Longo
said.

She said it is becoming more
difficult for Amnesty to gather
information because of the new
tactics of governments.

Even where there are official
governments to write to or
demonstrate against, “abusive
governments are getting a lot
smarter. They are finding other
tactics, such as disappearances.
It is harder for Amnesty
International to gather informa-
tion on individual prisoners,”
she said.

Campus groups are playing
an increasing role in Amnesty
International, according to
Longo.

“The role of campus groups
[high school and college] has
grown very significant, especial-
lyin the past five years. The
energy and commitment of
youth is amazing. Amnesty
International has responded by
increasing the share of work

delegated to these campus '

groups,” Longo said.

Take the space!

As many student groups already know, it is very diffi-
cult to attain adequate office space in the William Pitt
Union.

Most of Pitt’s student groups have been given desks in
the union to house the facilities of their group. However,
these desks do not allow for privacy or room to house
all members for impromptu meetings. _

The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance is one of the
few campus groups which has an office instead of a
desk. '

In 1992, the group was given a second ofﬁce. BiGAlA
currently uses one room as its general ofﬁce area with
resource material and space for officer meetings. The
second office is used as a social space and for holding
larger meetings. The second office also contains a televi-
sion and VCR for members to use.

According to business manager and former co-
President Todd Kinavey, BiGALA’s ofﬁce space is justi-
fied. T‘

“BiGALA is a very unique and a very diverse organiza-
tion. We serve both as a social-support service andas an
educational/ political service to both gay and straight stu-
dents. It’s not a matter of having two offices, it’s a matter
of having adequate space for these purposes.”

However, another campus group that has become
more and more active is Campus Women’s Organization.
CWO has now been offered an office space in the
union. The office it was offered is one of BiGALA’s. ‘ .

Although it seems that CW O would readily accept any
ofﬁce space available, they have yet to make any deci-
sion as to whether to take the office. ,

This may cause a rift in the working relationship
between the two groups, members from both organiza-
tions say. Shira Hassan, one of CWO’s co—presidents,
stated that the administration “wanted to seriously weak-
en the two groups.”

Joe Cavalla, director of Student Activities, has said that
he and union manager Chris Chergi have searched
throughout the union for an office space.

“Space is tight. There are many people waiting in line
for office space,” Cavalla said.

The university has checked into other opportunities

but the only feasible option is the BiGALA office,
according to Cavalla.

It wasn’t so long ago that the university did have a
women’s center on campus, located above the external
‘studies office on Forbes Avenue. It seems the university
*is once again taking steps toward recognizing the needs
of women students.

As a group whose function is to represent women’s
concerns, CWO must have ‘adequate space to do so.
Although we feel CWO should continue working
towards a women's center, it is first necessary to have a
base to start from. It is CWO’s responsibility to accept
the office space while they still have the choice.

Clinton obtains media make-over

US. News G World Report captured the mood
of the moment quite nicely in their June 7th issue.
“The headlines had been dominated by two full
weeks of flubs and venial sins — from a $200
haircut to a White House travel-office scandal --
that made the Clintonites look all at once like
Hollywood groupies, country bumbkins and
Watergate wannabes.” Ouch!

A few weeks ago, Clinton was as good as fin-
ished. From ﬂip—flopping on Bosnia to Travelgate
to Lani Gunier, the Clinton Administration was
floundering. He was indecisive

Angeles Times reported that, “Clinton dominated
the agenda, took a lion’s share of the media cov-
erage and achieved most of his  goals, including
a breakthrough on  international trade negotia-
tions and a boost in aid to Russia.”

Just a few short weeks ago we were being told
that Clinton was doomed and now we’re being
told that he is firmly in control. All of the sudden,
we see the president as acting, well, presidential.

Although there are a number of reasons for old
Bill’s resurgence, it can be summed up in two
words: David Gergen, the new

and incapable of focusing on

counselor to the president.

drifting. It was quite obvious  light the good things about the

that his demise was imminent.

Clinton presidency and to

Yes, yes, I know what some
of you are going to say. You’re
going to tell me that I’m exaggerating. You’re
going to argue that what matters is Clinton’s long-
term performance not his short-term errors.
However, I knew that old Bill was in trouble. I
knew it for a fact because the media told me!

No, really! It was on the cover of all the major
newsweeklies. Time talked about “the Incredible
Shrinking President.” Newsweek dug deep into
the pool of “Beltway Conventional Wisdom” in
order to answer the tough, probing question
“What’s Wrong?” The Washington punditocracy,
from the McLaughlin Group to This Week with
David Brinkley, spread the word that Clinton was
doomed. While they all said it a thousand differ-
ent ways in a thousand different forums, the pun-
dits and the journalists of America were all telling
us the same thing: “This guy is finished!”

Instead of dropping the ball at every given
opportunity, it appears that he is ﬁrmly in control.
Legislatively speaking, he’s pushed his economic
package through both houses of Congress
(although the differences between the two pack-
ages must still be hammered out) and a campaign
finance reform bill through the Senate.

On the world stage, he attacked Baghdad in
retaliation for Hussein’s‘ plot to kill George Bush
(and promptly gained in the polls). He stood defi-

antly along the Korean peninsula’s demilitarized

zone as if to say to North Korea: “Don’t even
think abouttrying to acquire the bomb!” Now,
old Bill ‘looks like a stand-up guy.

The Renaissance continued with the G-7 sum-
mit in Tokyo. While his peers stood quietly to the
side, the president took to the streets and univer-
sities of Tokyo to press the ﬂesh. See Bill take the
lead on the issue of aid to Russia! See Bill get a
bilateral trade agreement with Japan! If nothing
else, the prez put on quite a show.

Yes, thanks to the wonder of mass media, I
learned quite a bit. For example, in spite of initial
worries that he might not be up to the job, the Los

downplay the prez’s little boo-
boos.

So far, it seems to be working. The once press-
shy White House is now a regular PR factory.
During the G-7 summit, Clinton, Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and even Gergen himself
briefed the press daily. The July 5, 1993, issue of
Newsweek talked about Mr. Gergen persuading
the president to take arch-foe Bob Dole out to
dinner at a well—known Washington restaurant.

Since Gergen arrived, the Clinton administra-
tion has been more willing to play the D.C. media
game. The president may not always get his way,
but now at least he looks like he is setting the
agenda and framing the debates that surround
that agenda.

He has also learned all of the little tricks that
make all the difference image wise. If you have
an unpopular issue you have to deal with, put a
Cabinet officer out in front of the press. If you
want to get better coverage, hold a barbecue and
invite the press.

Overall, Bill Clinton has shown marked
improvement in his ability to manipulate the sym-
bols of the presidency. He now simply looks more
presidential than he did before. And in America,
perception is reality.

This last point, however, raises a disturbing
question about the character of this country. It
appears we’ve become more enamored with how
our leaders say things than with what they're say-
ing. Maybe we all ought to take a closer look at
the major issues of our day before we make up
our minds about them. This may take a little more
effort than what we're used to, but the end result
is well worth it. As for those of you who still think
it’s not worth your time to dig a little deeper,
that’s fine. Fine, that is, if you want to be manipu-
lated by some beltway spin factory for the rest of
your life. Just remember, you reap What you SOW

it may possess a tad of the neo-mascu-

Mac A

Directed by John Turturro
W'1'itten by john Turturro and
Brandon Cole

As each of the three Vitelli
brothers shit, shave and bathe
(Mac, Vico and Bruno respec-
tively), they dream of starting
their own construction compa-
ny and rebelling against their
unscrupulous boss. What a pic-
ture.

In John Turturro’s debut,
Mac, that’s exactly what we get
—— a string of hilarious, dramatic
or visually stunning pictures
held together with something
like chicken wire.

The emphasis on labor as its
own art form, the focus on
being forced to work under
unscrupulous bosses and the

_ price of blind ambition run in
and out of this story. All noble ,

themes indeed, but without
well—developed characters to
attach them to, it’s a little hard
to see the human implication.
Turturro and co—writer Brandon
Cole provide us with some ter-

rific moments tied to a narrative
about as solid as something
drawn on an Etch—a—Sketch.
Mac tells the story of the
film’s namesake and his two
brothers as they try to carry on
their father’s legacy as a crafts-
man and builder. Mac (John
Turturro) is driven by the lofty
notion that what he builds is his
art. Vico (Michael Badalucco) is

a bumbling, likeable stool pid— D

geon, and the last brother,
Bruno, (Carl Capotorto) is the
young, handsome, talented
painter who happens to get
involved with a beatnik played
by Ellen Barkin.

With the help of his wife
(Katherine Borowltz), Mac real-
izes his dream. But there is a
price for his ambition, and the
problems that Mac’s hell—bent
will creates among the brothers

is the film’s only unflattering
portrait. ..

Turturro startsus off with
some ‘visual braggadocio that
would make the Coen brothers
proud. The opening credits con-
sist of the most sumptuously
poured cement you’ll watch,
along with the most beautiful
mud, muck and rain I’ve seen

on film. This alone should
explain Tuturro’s bias. For him,
Mac is a self-described tribute
to his father and an homage to
the workingman in general.

It’s also a problematic film. In
elevating labor to the level of
high art, Turturro sometimes

buzz of conformity and familiarity. The
Grifters crush and crunch with hard-
assed feedback and hard—assed loudness
that’ll send you to a place so "molecularly
dense, it’ll be close to hard—assed guitar
hell. Who Monster Magnet shouldda
been and who Helios Creed should give
a healthy nod to, The Grifters effectively
mold a mean thickness outta a prickly
shell.

Moonshake could sound like Cop
Shoot Cop on Opal, and the group does,
if only for a moment. Then it moves on
to more ambitious and vivid horizons.
While the band is musically ambidex-
trous, it also competently displays its
ability to rearrange each song on its lat-
est release on Matador, Eva Luna.
Combining tape loops, horns, repetitive
bass dirges, impeccable guitar winks and
other various freak effects, these four
Brit blokes scramble the avant wasteland
with weird, sonic ramblings and fill the
wet holes with experimental and discor-
dant texture.

While the ‘Burgh appears to be no
place to embrace its own sensory alter-
ers, Moonshake is certainly worth an
attentive listen. With an aptly-tagged
band name grabbed from a Can song,
Moonshake dissolves comfortable struc-

ture and dumps on a load of gruff and 

grimy whitewash.

Heads for German
pro league; replaced
by assistant Braziel

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Last month Sue \X/oodstra went to
Colorado as an assistant coach for the
IIS. volleyball team in the \‘(/orld
Ilniversity (lame. Pitt was only sharing
its head volleyball coach then.

Next month, \V'oodstra will leave for a
team that is not in a sharing mood.

After four years as head coach of the
Pitt volleyball team. \\"oodstra resigned
late last week to take a professional
coaching position with IISC Munster,
the top club team in Germany.

"It's hard because I know I am leav-
ing a good situation with a good team
 I know as much as I can about what
I am going into, but it’s new," Woodstra
said. “It's pretty exciting. I tend to enjoy

these challenges.’’

Cindy Braziel, the top assistant coach
and recruiter for the Panthers the last
two seasons, will take over the team
when Woodstra leaves July 31.

Woodstra said that a former teammate
from Southern Cal and the U8. national
team, Terry Place, recommended her
name to the team when the job opened
up.

\X/oodstra's departure was no great
shock to those in the program. Pitt
Senior Associate Athletic l)irector Carol
Sprague said that she knew of outside
interest in the Panthers‘ coach. Much of
that could be due to the improvements
in the program over the last four sea-
S()Il‘3.

Pitt had been a contender in the Big
East under previous coach, Shelton
Collier, winning four of the previous
seven conference titles, but the Panthers
have dominated the conference and
moved up on the national level since
\X/oodstra’s arrival.

\X/oodstra’s teams didn‘t lose a single

match in league play until last year. In
Big East play, Pitt ended up with a
record of 32-2 with three regular season
championships and four post-season
titles.

Overall, Pitt was 110-39 during the
past four seasons. The Panthers gar-
nered the only NCAA Tournament victo-
ry in their history in \X/oodstra’s second
season (1990), upsetting Ohio State in
the first round.

Sprague, who has been involved in
Pitt‘s volleyball program since it began
in 1974, said she expects the program to
continue to move up with lira’/.iel
replacing \V"oodstra.

“\'t(’e‘\'e been very lucky [with coach-
esl," Sprague said. “Mike Hebert was
our coach, and he is now the head
coach at Illinois, a top-1t) program.
Shelton Collier was our coach and went
on the national team and is now at
Georgia Tech. Then you get a Sue
Woodstra. I think Cindy will follow
along and take it to the next step

Sprague said the quick move to

choose Braziel is indicative of the ath-
letic department’s Confidence in her.

“In my mind, lBraziell was the perfect
person for the job, and that’s why we
[promoted her] as quickly as we did,”
Sprague said. “I had thought in my
mind that if we lost Sue, Cindy was
capable of stepping in.”

Before coming to Pitt, the 52-year-old
Bra’/.iel served assistant coaching stints
at Texas A&M (1989-90) and \I(=’yoming
(1984-889). She played collegiate volley-
ball at Indiana Ilniversity.

In her two seasons at Pitt, lira‘/.iel”s
main contribution has been in the area
of recruiting. Last season. it was an out-
standing class of rookies that filled in
when the Panthers lost six players to
graduation the previous year.

Woodstra said that lira‘/.iel's work at
Pitt so far is just the beginning

"I have a lot of respect for her and I
think the players do, too,” Woodstra
said. “I have always felt as though she
had the capabilities to be an excellent
head coach.”

So hectic is the day—to—day grind of
.VIarian Cassidy, Pitts newly-hired women‘s
swim coach. that seemingly simple clerical
tasks have become difficult to grasp.

"I don‘t even know how to put my '

phone on hold," Cassidy said jokingly
from her Fitzgerald Field House office.
"That's how behind I am.“

Cassidy has good reason to feel a bit
ft'2l'/.’/.lL‘(l these days. It's a rare day when
you become head coach at your college
stomping grounds, as she did June 7, 1995.
It’s even more rare to gain a college head
coaching position just nine years after
graduating from high school.

For the \Wilmington, I)el., native — who
turned 27 on June 22 — the chance of

being head coach at the Ilniversity of  9

Pittsburgh is purely once in a lifetime.

“I‘m very excited to return to Pitt.“
Cassidy said. “The opportunity to coach at
your alma mater doesnt occur often."

Its been a fast climb up the coaching
ranks for Cassidy. an eight-time Big Fast

champion at Pitt from l‘)S-4-88. She has 
come full-circle in her trip through the col—   - ~
legiate ranks — from champion swimmer 

at Pitt to assistant coaching gigs at Pitt,
Florida State and Miami of Florida to head
coach of Pitt women‘s swimming. All in
less than a decade.

To top it off, she followed in the foot-
steps of her college coach, David
Belowich. Belowich resigned on March 31,

1993.

For Cassidy, who received her first assis— 

tant position from Belowich in 1988, the
resignation of the longtime Pitt coach was
unexpected.

“I was a little surprised that he resigned,”
Cassidy said. “Having swam for him, I real-
ly thought he was going to be here for a
while. But stranger things have happened.”

Like replacing your old coach.

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Last week Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes contin-
ued to shufﬂe the Pitt athlet-
ic department while adding
a new card to the deck.

Carol Sprague was pro-
moted to senior associate
athletic director for varsity
sports. She now takes added
responsibility for overall
management of the depart-
ment.

Former assistant ticket
manager Rex Hough
replaced Dick Lukehart as
ticket manager. Lukehart
retired June 30.

The new card is former
Assistant Commissioner of
the Western Athletic
Conference Mark Hollis. The
30-year-old Hollis steps in
for Bobby Lewis, who also
retired June 30, as Pitt’s
assistant athletic ‘director for
Operations and Facilities
Management.

The moves are part of
Pitt’s ongoing restructuring
process.

In May, Jaynes said he

‘Athletic department

Hoagb; laires new
asst. athletic director

hoped to have things in
place by early July (The Pitt
News, May 19). The two
positions he specifically
mentioned to be filled were
the ones taken by Hough
and Hollis.

With the WAC, Hollis
worked primarily in the
areas of financial manage-
ment and marketing.

WAC Commissioner Joe
Kearney said that while the
conference office does not
have athletic facilities, Hollis
did get some experience in
facilities management
because he coordinated
conference tournaments.

“We do get involved with
a lot of games management
or facilities management
people at the conference
office,” Kearney said. “We
get to see how they operate
and work with them.”

No words from Pitt on
whether further administra-
tive changes would be
made.

Jaynes was out of town
and could not be reached
for comment. He is set to
return to work next week.

 

Cassidy

for the same goals.

“The nice thing about Pitt is
there is a wide range of ability.
Some may be shooting to get
to NCAA’s and some may be
shooting to make the travelling
team or Big East’s [champi-
onship], but everybody’s going
for the same thing, competing
as a team.”

Though Cassidy may lack the
years experience “assumed”
necessary to become a head
coach, her relative youth will
be an asset to the Pitt program,
according to former Miami
head coach Richard Calahan.
(Cassidy worked as an assistant
for Calahan last year.)

“She can relate because she
is still a swimmer  she com-
petes as a distance swimmer
herself,” Calahan said. “[Plusl
she’s knowledgeable way
beyond her years.

Though Calahan recently
departed from the college
coaching ranks, he wasn’t short
on advice for his former assis-
tant about the profession.

“Just enjoy yourself. Be
happy with the rewards that
come with leading a team. If
they swim fast, it’s a bonus. As
long as she can help them
through four years of school,”
Calahan said.

Another former head coach
yvho remarked favorably.to
Cassidy’s appointment was the
man she replaced, David
Belowich.

Marian is she is a very, very
intelligent lady,” Belowich said.
“She was an excellent student
at Pitt and will bring that intelli-
gence to the team. ‘

“I’m very, very proud of her.
If I had a little of something to
do with that  great.”

Since assuming her duties
last week, Cassidy -— along
with former teammate and cur-
rent assistant coach Laure
Walczak — have been busy

organizing and planning for the ~

upcoming season.
Her immediate concern for

the upcoming season?
Recruiting.
“Whenever you have a

coaching change, it can be dif-
ficult on recruiting,” Cassidy
said. “Most have decided on
other places  and that hap-
pens. We have three girls who
have committed. I’m hoping
there are going to be a couple
more [recruits] in the fall,” she
said.

As Cassidy prepares for her
debut season as Pitt’s head
coach, she doesn’t have any
concrete plans for changes in
the program.

She just wants to continue
the winning tradition.

“I really need to get a better
handle on the situation [before
making changes],” Cassidy said.
“I think that the University of
Pittsburgh women's swimming
and diving team has a great tra-
dition.

“I want to continue that tradi-

said. “We had a differ-

ence of opinion  they
disagreed [so] I
resigned."

Pitt senior associate
athletic director Carol
Sprague would not com-
ment on Belowich’s res-
ignation, stating Pitt
doesn’t “comment on
matters of personnel.”

Belowich voiced no
regrets about his current
unemployment status,
dividing his time
between running swim
camps and spending time
with his family. While his
plans for the future are
unknown, his place of
residence is fixed.
Belowich has no plans of
moving from his Butler,

Pa., home.
“There are things to
consider other than

coaching in the collegiate
ranks,” Belowich said.
“I’m not going to leave
where I live. It’s special."

His proudest accom-
plishment at Pitt?
“Probably the reputation
the program now has,”
Belowich said. “When
you leave Pitt, you are
going to get an educa-
tion, be a hard worker
and be dedicated.”

“The great thing about tion.’’
