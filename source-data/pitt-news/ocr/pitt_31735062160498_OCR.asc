~-The Interfraternity Trophy, stolen from the

’ Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity house on May 4, is

still‘ missing today. .

Ronald Ecker, president of Phi Ep, ﬁled a
complaint to the Oakland Police Station last
Sunday night.

Oakland police turned the complaint over
the City Detective Bureau. Ecker said, “Police
are going to Search University buildings for it
this week, unless it is returned.” ,

ber of another fraternity, a member of another
Phi Ep chapter visiting the campus, or an in-
dependent. We know it was taken by a prank-
ster as a joke, but we feel the fun is over and
would like it back.” '

The gold plated trophy is University proper-
ty and valued from $60 to,$100. It is believed
to have beenpurloined from the house on Dith-
ridge St. between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m.

' In the past two years that the‘Phi Eps have
won the trophy, it was pilfered a couple of
tiimes bypfraternity men but returned the next

Lud Lippert, president of IE Council,_said,
“If any fraternity ‘man has the trophy I hope
he will return it to the Phi Eps.”

The IF cup is given to the fraternity that

accumulates the highest number of points for‘
outstanding participation in athletics and ex-
cellence in ‘scholarship.

The trophy will be awarded one more time’
and then discontinued. If the Phi Eps win it

this time they will be able to keep it per— ;

manently, since they have won it in the past
two years. If» the thief returns it, that is.

Watered Down Political
Clubs Given Approval

By JOHN KULAMER. ~

In a watered-down form,
approved.

The administration did a quick reverse in its stand
on that worrisome subject this week with the announce-
ment that the recognition committee had approved two

campus politicking has been

political clubs.

The committee met without any
fanfare last Thursday, and at the
end of an hour-long session gave
its blessing to the “Pitt Republi-
cans,” (formerly the “Students for
Taft) and the “Young Democrats.”

Result of Study

Dean of Men Theodore W. Bid-
dle said the sudden switch was
made as the result of study by the
committee pf a report, compiled at
the direction of the Falk Founda-
tion, on the extent of student par-
ticipation in political activities.

The report speciﬁcally recom-
mended that students be given
greater *opportunity to “practice
politics as they are on the out-
side.” .

However, Dean ‘Biddle stressed
that the clubs would still have to
operate within the framework of
regulations governing campus or-
ganizations. ‘

“I don’t think,” he said, “that
we can allow the university to
become a political battleground.”

In other words, free campaign-

taboo.

Meetings Allowed
. Members of the clubs will be
allowed to hold meetings to dis-
cuss the merits of the various can-

didates. They can also sponsor

speeches by their candidat’s sup-
porters.
' But standard rules governing the
presentation of such speakers will
have to be complied with, andan
opportunity given for the other
side to have its say, either by hav-
ing another speaker present the
opposing view or else allowing for
a question period after the speech.

Dean Biddle denied that it was
the pressure of adverse editorial
criticism in the downtown news-
papers that caused the committee
to change its mind.

Complete Information
Recognition was granted, he
said, on the basis of the more com-
plete information provided by the
Falk Foundation report. ‘
The decision doesn’t neces-
sarily throw the doors open to all
political groups. When asked if
some club such as a “Young Com-
munists” group would be allowed
to organize, Dean Biddle asserted
that under the Loyalty Oath law
he believed that the Chancellor
would be required, in his annual
statement to the governor, to re-
port the presence of “subversive”
student, as well as faculty groups.
On that basis, he said, the com-
mittee would have to refuse recog-
nition to such groups.

Ross Reese, of the Young Demo-
crats, and Dan Purdy, bf the Pitt

of achieving more than a skeleton
organization before the semester
ends. Reese has called a meeting
for Wednesday, May 21 at 3:30
.p.m., while Purdy has not yet set
a date for his meeting..
_ Organizational Meetings
All that either men hope to
achieve -at these meetings is or-
ganization of constitution, by-
laws, and election_ of oiﬁcers. Purdy
said,‘ “The real work will begin
next September.”
, At that time, both clubs hope to
hold picnics, dances, forums, and

\ discussions to beat the drums for

their prospective candidates.

The Panther comes‘out today for the I

last time. And there is not a 'R.oman’s.
chance that thelﬁnal. issue will offend
anyone, for like some of its predecessors
earlier in the year, this ‘edition has a.
scrubbed look.» Most of- the material does
not even come under the classiﬁcation of
“humorous.” -

tors realize, nothing is
harder
funny. Even national
humor magazines,
equipedwith top'ﬂight
professional t a 1 e n t ,
often miss their mark.
Realizing that theysare
,,,, __  __ not funny, many writ-
ers of humor introduce the so .called
“dirty” material,’ and it is this quality.
that dominates, not the humor.

Humor . De-emphasized — C
When and if the publication board de-
‘cides to create a successor to the Panther,

it ‘is certain that there will be‘ a drastic‘

 

de-emphasis upon the use ‘of humor. This "
= will be a wise step. For the concentration
on humor had destroyed] the possibility"

of making the Panther a magazine that

"would adequately reﬂect all phases of“

University life.

Now one of the most amazing charac-
teristics of Pitt is the number of stu-
dents who are unaware of even their im-'
mediate surroundings. .They know even
less of the rest of the school, or of campus
activities. Even many. “activity” men are
ignorant of many facets of school life.

Few of the eighth ﬂoor handshakers,
for instance, know what their ,female
counterparts on the 12th are,.doing. Wom-
en’s activities are a mysteryto all, un-
derstandably enough, ‘but women. A sec-

tion in the new publication on the woman ’

at Pitt would be not only informative and
educational, but also entertaining.

Bring PiH- Closer

‘ In this, and‘ many other ways, a new
‘magazine could make Pitt closer to us.
Discussion of ca_mpus,problems, reports
on the various departments and schools,
description of fraternity life, more cov-
erage on sports, intramural as well as
varsity, could all be presented.

The magazine could not only depict the H

light side of campus life, but the serious

sidealso. Thereis no reason why one ‘

should be excluded at the expense of the
other. - c

A new magazine,‘ that would,‘ in the
fullest sense, be a “campus” mag, could

go’ a long way. in» giving Pitt the flavor“

ithat an urban institution too often lacks.

I think Billy Meyer is the poorest manager in the National

League.

It’s because I attend school and run into the same
problems that confront many other students at _Pitt.
That is the question of parking space in Schenley Plaza.

During the school year arriving:

in Oakland after 9 a.m., a student
has about as much chance of park-
ing as the Pi-
rates have of
climbing out of
the cellar this
week.

So the poor
student either

class or parks

quently he ﬁnds

oauand police are eager to
tag college students who have
committed the unpardonable sin
of parking illegally in order to
make an English class on time. .

This shows that District‘ Attor-
nery George Malone’s election
plank of cleaning up the rackets
has moved accordingly. and the
worse racket in town—that of
parking in Schenley Plaza-—is be-
ing corrected.

By DAVE MAZER

Battling power was the keynote when Delta Sigma Delta
walloped the Dental School Sophomores, 34-22, Monday in
an Independent League contest.

Played in a driving Wind storm, the game produced
56 runs, the highest total of the season and one of the highest
ever recorded in intramural play.

The Delts scored their 34 runs on 27' hits and twelve

Pi Lams Win First,

Beat Sammies, 7-4

A big inning can certainly
change the course of a softball
game and Pi Lambda Phi followed

that principle Friday when they
scored six runs in the third inning
to whip Sigma Alpha Mu, 7-4, in
Section Two of the inter-frater-
nity league.

The victory was the ﬁrst one of
the season for the Pi Lams after
two losses.

The Sammies scored one run in
the ﬁrst frame to take an early
lead. The Pi Lams though, came
back in the third, Herbie Meyers
delivering the key blow with a
two—run single.

Although the Sammies rallied
for four straight hits and three
runs in the ﬁfth, pitcher Bob Zang-
well settled down and shutout the
opposition the rest of the way to
preserve the victory. Zangwell
allowed nine hits but did not give
up any bases on balls.

Pi Lam also had nine hits with
Meyer collecting a double and sin-
gle and three runs-batted—in. Bob-
by Roth had a two-run triple in the
ﬁfth .plus a single to head the
1\oser’s attack. The‘ defeat was the
second straight for the Sammies.

a long overdue event may be re-
corded into Pitt’s track records
this Saturday.

For this weekend the thinclads
visit their perennial rival, Penn
State—a foe they haven’t beaten
since ’pre—war days.

The Panthers, however, are gen-
erally conceded their best chance
in years-—-that is, except for the
typically cautious observations of
Coach Olson.

“It’s going to be a‘ close meet,"
Olson warns. “I think the mile
relay team will decide it. But
their relay team has turned in
better times than ours this year.

“State is especially strong in the
sprints, pole vault, high jump, jav-
elin, and two mile run.” A

But Olson, too, has some for-

midable point-getters. Among
them are John Patellos, who does

-the broad jump and sprints, and

hurdler Wally Monohan.

At present, Monohan‘ leads the
team in total points scored with
251/2," but Patellos is only half a
point behind.

Playhouse Revniewi

By DICK

’The excitements on Craft Avenue these evenings are
rare and spotted. The Playhouse is currently playing host ,
to a mawkish little gluepot called “Wonderful Good” but
which_happens to be‘ plenty ordinary.

poor judgement and let it go. The
important news is that the Play:
house has opened their plush new
Craft Avenue Theatre; no one
should mind waiting a bit longer
for far better entertainments
than those presentlypbeing shown.
Things in Bad Shape

For onstage things are not well.
About ﬁfteen minutes after the
second act of “Wonderful Good”
began, a bearded character c_alled
Little Eli came out and announc-
ed that he was putting a hex ‘on
the proceedings.

Since this matter had been at-
tended to previously-‘—during a‘ﬂat
and vapid ﬁrst act-—I looked upon
such antics as so, much wasted
effort. «

Even by the most charitable
standards this show is a hope-
lessly clumsy compound of bad
writing I and tenth—rate _music,
whose hunior is dependent upon
cheap, greasy shpts of dialogue
that could well stand a liberal ap-
plication of soap and water.

Men's Council Mothers

Fresh. Opens

New Lounge

By ELINORE STONE

From Freshman Week until Graduation Day, Men’s
Council mothers the men at Pitt. Formed in the Student
Faculty Association to “handle activities strictly pertaining
to male students,” Council has been on the job since 1936.

During its ﬁrst year on campus, Council set
to welcome and aid male transfer.

students. Council also organized
a student loan fund which has
since helped many a student out
of hot water. ,
, Orients Freshmen
Perhaps Council’s biggest task
is orienting freshmen to the tra-
ditions of life at Pitt. Members
meet the new Pittites when they

enter, introduce them to life at‘

Pitt, and supervise an orientation
program for six weeks. '
Dinks re-appeared at Pitt, as
part of Council’s program, in
September of 1949 after an on-
again oﬁ-again history before
the war.

The year of 1938 saw the es-
tablishment of the Student Book
Exchange.‘ Open at the start of
each semester, students could and
still can buy second-hand books
from Council’s exchange. The
money they earned went to pad
the loan fund. This year, under
Mort Goldstein, the book store
proﬁt was the largest ever—-
$785.04.

To save the fellows some money,
Council set up a Tuxedo Exchange
on the eighth floor in ’39 to rent
tuxes at"‘r’easonable costs.” The
project was short-lived. This year,
members have been contacting
downtown stores in hopes of se-
curing reduced rates on men's
clothes for Pitt's men. They hope
lto‘have such a system in opera-

A tion by next Fall.

Last year at this time, under
President. Roy Titchworth, Men’s
Council opened their long-awaited
lounge on the eighth ﬂoor com-
plete with ping pong tables, bridge
tables, a juke box, and candy, gum,
and cigarette machines. It cost
Council $1400. But, they’re still
planning. ‘

Paint Walls

In the future, they hope to paint
the walls, hang drapes, buy more
furniture, place some ﬂoor lamps
in a few strategic spots and have
someone in the lounge to care for
it constantly. “All we need,” said
this year’s president, Jack Bur-
winkle, “is more money and Uni-
versity approval.”

This year, Council set up a
check-cashing fund at the Student
Desk. From 2:30 to 5 p.m., checks

Seniors’ Grades

it Due May 23*

Graduating seniors have seven
more school days to inﬂuence their
ﬁnal grades. 

The University's timetable for
graduating an estimated 2000
members of the Class of ’52 sets
Friday, May 23 as the deadline
for senior, grades to be sent to
the registrar’s office.

Though the senior deadline
comes a week before the end of
classes, May 29, each instructor
is permitted to make his own de-
cision on how long the seniors are
expected to attend class.

Within a few days following the
recording of grades, the regis-
trar’s oﬂice will notify the mem-
bers of the senior class whether
they pass or fail.
