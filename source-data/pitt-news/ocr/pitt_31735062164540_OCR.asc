Vrana Reviews Work  

At Joint SG Session

By JACK! KATZ

John Vrana, president of
Student; Government review-
ed the actions of SG for the
past year and assessed the
strengths and weaknesses of
the student senate in his
ﬁnal report at a joint meet-
ing of the old and new senators
Thursday evening.

Vrana stressed that this year
SG has “gone into the recom-
mending business. This is the ﬁrst
time Student Government has
recommended to different offices
that speciﬁc things be done. We
received full or partial satisfac-
tion on every recommendation
but one.”

The one recommendation which
Vrana _was referring to was a
letter sent to the Port Author-
ity Transit requesting commuter
rates for transportation. The Sen-
ate received a “ﬂat no” from the
Authority.

,mittee puts the social calendar

would have to come‘ from the g 
state government. ‘

Vrana said that all University- .
wide social events must be now '
approved by the calendar com-
mittee. This committee consists‘
of the president of SG and the .
seven vice-presidents. “This com-

Although he felt this year had -.
been a good one, Vrana said there
was still some improvement need-
ed. He would like to see more ,
done with the Liberal 
courses and also wants more iné "

Advance Team Prepared Way‘

Speakers Kick Off

B! MARIE KUKICH

Two advance team Peace Corps members are on campus
as part of Peace Corps Week which begins today. Marie
Duff and David Raphael are preparing the way for Peace
Corps recruiters and speakers to arrive later in the week by
informing students about the general program and oppor-

tunities offered by the Corps.

“There are still many misconceptions concerning the
Peace Corps which we hope to correct,” Raphael said. “One
is that an applicant must have a highly developed skill.

“Actually, a liberal arts graduate can be successful in the pro-
gram after completing the training if he demonstrates that he is
emotionally mature and has the right personality characteristics.”
Volunteers serve in a variety of projects in teaching, agriculture,
health, public works, and community development. ' ,

According to the team members, practical experience in such
areas as construction, farming, public health, and recreation’s pro-

grams represent added qualiﬁcations,

but not a requirement.

Volunteers in the corps serve two years, including .two-to-three

months training.

_They receive a modest living allowance plus a “readjustment

 

for each month of service.

By PETE HORN

The United States has an un-
sympathetic attitude toward Arab
nations, political science Profes-
f sor Richard Cottam explained

Thursday night.
, This American outlook results
from four factors, Dr. Cottam in-
dicated: widespread ignorance,
' an anti-colonialist tradition, mem-
ories of Hitler, and determined

anti-communism.
Dr. Cottam described how the
impact of Hitler's crimes gener-
ated an American consensus of
sympathy with the Jewish peo-
ple who were establishing their
homeland in Palestine, much to
 ’ Arab chagrin. He said that many
 , of the news media portray the
. situation from .a pro - Israeli
.1 , standpoint. This does not, he em-
phasized, stem from Zionist in-

ﬂuence. ,

The American policy of anti-
' communism, Dr. Cottam said, di-
rects a large portion of our at-

 

Professor Richard Cottam

titude toward the Near East.
While we favored the vociferous
anti-communists, who were the
traditional leaders, we also sup-
ported popular regimes under
modernizing leadership.

oicy

 

    s   =

The hot-.and-cold nature of
United States support was illus-
trated by the case of Egypt,
where the United States approved
the overthrow of King Farouk,
but cooled toward Nasser when
he neutralized and showed signs
of becoming “soft on commu-
nism.”

The President and his advisers,
according to Dr. Cottam, hold a
Largely pro-Israeli view, while in
the lower levels of the bureaucra-
cy there ex-ists a more wide-
spread pro-Nasser feeling.

Today most Americans believe
communism should be contained
in the Near East. In addition, Dr.
Cottam said, Americans accept
Israel, and believe that it should
be recognized by the Arabs, just
as many think the United States
should recognize Red China.

Two slick, cliche-ridden Amer-
ican tourist ﬁlms followed in

sharp contrast to Dr. Cottam’s *

talk.

Dean Tells of Indian Work

By ELLEN TANNENBAUM

Professor Richard L. Park,
newly-appointed dean of the
Division of the Social Sci-
ences, was the first repre-
sentative to the Asia Foun-
dation’s Indian office in New
Delhi. The Asia Foundation
(a private organization),
gives small grants for proj-
ects in education and culture.

The Founda- - .
tion annually
distributes over
200,000 Ameri-
can - donated
books to Indian
Universities.
Through the ef- -
forts o f Dr.
Park one institu-
tional library
was boosted from 30 to over 500
books.

The Indian office of the Asia
Foundation, acting as informal
consultant to the Indian Plan-
ning Commission and other plan-
ning bodies, encouraged the In-
dian government to begin estab-
lishing three urban research cen-
ters. Professor Park explained
that although 80 to 85 per cent

of the Indians now live in the I

country, urbanization is becom-
ing becoming a problem because

    

n PW

of increasing industrialization.
Dean Park, a specialist on In-
dian (affairs, became interested
in the ﬁeld after serving for two
years in India as a captain in
the‘ United States Army Air
Force. Since 1945, he has been to
India at least once every year.

The Dean will return to India
this May to participate in the
opening session’ of the School of
Political Science. The school,
which the Dean founded, offers
a summer program in ‘research
techniques.

Dr. Park served on the fac-

ulty of the Political Science De -

partment of the University of
California at Berkeley. There he
was /advisor to Project Pakis-
tan, /India, Ceylon (PIC) which
is designed to give students the
opportunity for first hand Asian
study. The Dean accompanied 12
students on their Asian tour in
1953.

“It is the job of each division
of study in the University,” said
Professor Park, “to develop com-
mon facilities which will make
departmental work more fruit-
mi)

He would like the Division of
Social Sciences to establish a
data bank which can be used
"for training in research techni-
ques. Dr. Park feels that an ex-
pert in this ﬁeld should be avail-
able to advise graduate students
on their projects. He would like
to see an increase in multi-de-

partmental research projects.

He also explained that the sen-

that SG should have a judicial

Need Sense 2 of "Identity;

  

Women’s Role Discussed  

By BONNIE STONE
The American woman should have a sense of individual
identity, stressed Dr. Dora F. Capwell, director of the Psy-
chological Service of Pittsburgh in her Thursday lecture,
part of the YWCA’s “Role of Women” series. “Every gener-

ation has its own set of problems to meet; each person
must find his own way to his identity,” she said.

Dr. Capwell used Henry David Thorea.u’s Words. in an -

analogy, “If a man doesn’t keep pace, let him know which
drummer he is following.” Expressing the same idea in her

own words, she said: “Experi-
ence islan individual thing; it is
up to the person to ﬁnd himself.”

Dr. Capwell offered three sug-
gestions to University women,
concerning this personal identity,
hoping that their lives as stu-
dents and as women would be

r enriched. Her first point empha-

everyone at some time will ﬁnd
excitement out of learning.” The
few truly gifted professors can
convey this excitement, she feels,
and such contacts are invaluable
to student motivation.

Although some women students
have the initial motivation, 59
per cent "of the women who be-
gin college fail to complete it-
an action which she considers ex-
tremely wasteful. College is con-
ducive to establishing a career,
and in our. -present society, most
women work. “Marriage versus

well, is a “dead issue” because
at the present time the working

part of our culture.

Finally, Dr. Capwell stressed
the importance of personal iden-
tiﬁcation. To have a creative life

Economics seems to have won as the dominant value again as the
‘Dean of Women’s Office considers putting freshman women in the Medical
Center Nurses’ Residence to help allay the housing shortage on the lower

campus.

Not only would this mean separating these women from the immedi-

‘ ate contact with Quadrangle activities and the majority of upperclassmen,
it but it would mean isolating them even from each other in single rooms.

Freshmen at the University have been traditionally impressed with

the importance of dormitory living, more specifically communal dormitory

living in suites of four to six in McCormick and Brackenridge Halls or in

double or triple rooms in Holland. Learning to live with different kinds of

people, they are told, sleeping in the same rooms with roommates of differ-

ent backgrounds, will be a maturing process that is as much a part of their

education as their classroom Work.

In fact, in Brackenridge and Holland, ﬂoors of freshmen are put
together just for these reasons under the supervision of a select upper-
class woman who is there, more or less simply, to guide their adjustment.

If freshman women lived in the Nurses’ Residence they probably

Fair - Weather Philosophy?
would be grouped together under the same kind of supervision and would
have contact with upperclassmen living in that dormitory. This is a new
building and a University supervised residence, unlike Webster Hall which
has also been used for dorm overﬂow. The rationale seems obvious: it is a
practical move.
But- it still does not satisfy traditional philosophy, for its also seems
obvious that freshman women living away from the quadrangle and possi-
bly eating in the Nurses’ Residence cafeteria are going to ﬁnd considerable
difficulty pretending they are in the Quad with all the other freshmen, the
majority of upperclassmen, the men students, and most of campus activity.
Nor will they really be living with each other—for a-private room, which
can be a prerogative for an upperclassman who has chosen that kind of
living arrangment, could possibly be a recluse for a shy freshman and an
avoidance of a truly educational experience.
We are quite surprised that the Dean of Women’s Office would even
consider separating the freshmen like this—or that they would accept so
many more dormitory students than they can accommodate to put them-
selves in this position at all.

 

  

   
 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 

Anti-Eric Stern
Letter Criticized ‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was quite astounded by the
excess of presumption demon-
strated by Brise Bickerton in his
letter of March 3. Mr. Bickerton
has informed us that the recent-
ly elected president of Student
Government is a man who “hard-
ly has the image of a normal Pitt
student or of a Student Govern-
_ment president.”

I, for one would be very anxi-
ous to learn about the “normal
Pitt student” because I am not
quite sure that I have ever met
him. If you yourself represent
him, Mr. Bickerton, then he must
be a very sagacious being, in-
deed. For you, have already pre-
dicted the course of the coming
year for us, so certain are you
that it will represent “a mistake,
a farce, and an abortion.”

And if you are truly the “nor-
mal Pitt student,” then what a
selﬁsh and narrow-minded crea-
ture he is—-one who puts his per-
sonal bias above a sincere con-
cern for the welfare of his school.
In short, what .a poor sport.

I8 do not know Eric Stern per-
sonally. I cannot predict the
quality of his leadership as pres-
ident of Student Government.
But I do know that the student
body of the University of Pitts-
burgh has entrusted him with
that high office, and in the best

interest of my school and yours,

Mr. Bickerton, I hope he will
make an excellent president, and
I wish him allthe possible suc-
cess.

Editor, The Pitt News:
The recent Student Govern-

, victory of the bearded one and
.'his cohorts of the Pitt Progres-

aside, if they sally forth against
the administration as they indi-
cated they would from their cam-

 . paign promises, the student body

will receive a defeat more ig-
nominous than that suffered by
Don Quixote from the windmill.

Though the number of stu-
dents voting increased from last
year, the majority still did not
vote, indicating that apathy is
more popular than either the

consoles me. I am a senior and

Budget Figures

Cause Wonder -

Editor, The Pitt News:

Whatever else reporter Jacki
Katz revealed about the Univer-
sity budget, one thing is clear:
the word-jugglers outdistanced
the ﬁgure-balancers. That tiny
sum for “administration” is most
artfully placed beside the awe-
some expenditure for “instruc-
tion”; a very impressive, if mis-
leading, juxtaposition.

Just what is this Administra-
tion cost? It obviously does not
include Physical Plant, Business
Affairs, Development, Planning
and Policy, or the Auxiliary En-
terprises which total $8,348,000.
That ﬁgure represents 14.4 per
cent of the total budget.

I presume the Administration

ﬁgure is for some secretarial sal-
aries, but only those in adminis-
tration offices, not including de-
partment or Dean's offices. The
wording, as I said, is impressive
but Vice-Chancellor Monnett has
more questions to answer about
a few items.

I would also like to congratu-
late him on the statement that
the cost of instruction causes the

The

   

One of Americcfsﬂju

tution to rise. This may well be
the facile oversimpliﬁcation of
the year, particuarly in the ab-
sence of any explanation of what
“Instruction” means. The secre-
taries and most junior faculty
(assistant professors and instruc-
tors) can well testify to the fact
that they have not been guilty of
pushing tuition up because of the
cost of their private secretaries,
use of University automobiles,
private offices, Bigelow carpets
and expense account lunches.

For that kind of ﬁscal fat I
suggest the budget butchers stand
up, plant one foot ﬁrmly beside
the desk and rotate 360 degrees.
It would be enlightening trip
.and there would be no travel
voucher to submit.

‘News’ Omission

Cited by Reader

Editor, The Pitt News: .

It was just by chance that I
heard Mr. Talcott Parsons, one
of the most noted sociologists of
our time, if not the most noted,
was to be here on Pitt’s campus
to deliver a talk Feb. 25. Un-
fortunately I found out too late.
I wondered how I could have
missed reading about his arrival,
so I checked the Monday and
Wednesday issues of last week’s
Pitt News. I did ﬁnd out such

important dates as when the So- .

ciety for the Prevention of Dis-
mantling Gustines would meet,
but—alas, not when Mr. Parsons
would be here-

So I sat back and waited to‘
read about his having been here.
In the March Pitt News I found
several columns on what Dr.
Rankin had to say about the al-
locations for student activities,
but—alas, again, not one sen-
tence on what Mr. Parsons had
to say.

Then I started thinking—may-

Midday Crowd
Disappoints

Editor, The Pitt News:

The’ Midday program of Feb.
24 didn’t have a celebrity, but
it did deal with a subject which-
should be of signiﬁcance to to-
day’s college student, i.e., arms
control. Yet, the attendance was
almost nil (about 40 people).

This paucity of attending stu-
dents resulted, I feel, not from
the absence of a stimulating topic,
but instead, to the Pitt student’s
great interest
rather than signiﬁcant issues.

There were crowds to hear
Jimmy Piersall and John How-
ard Griffin; yet, when the un-
known Col. Jack Wagstaif came
to speak on “Arms Control and
the Defense Department,”_ a top-
ic of crucial importance in to-
day’s world, no one attended.

I .am not suggesting that this
topic should be our ultimate
concern; what I do wish to say
is that -the poor attendance at
this Midday program demon-

strates a lack of insight on the
part of many students.

Their concern about the world
is not as deep as it may appear-
I congratulate the 800-who heard
John Howard Griffin last week
—but why didn’t a few return
to hear about armscontrol? Be-
cause John Howard Griffin is a
celebrity and Col. Jack Wagstaif
is not. Yet, what each had to
say to college students was of
equal importance.

responsibility
A key dimension of any job is the responsibility
involved. Graduates who join Ford Motor Com-
pany ﬁnd the opportunity to accept responsibility
early in their careers. The earlier the better. How-
ever, we know the transition from the academic
world to the business world requires training.
Scholastic achievements must be complemented by
a solid understanding of the practical, day-to-day
aspects of the business. That is the most direct
route to accomplishment.

Stephen Jaeger, of the Ford Division’s Milwaukee‘

District Sales Oﬂice, is a good example of how it

works. His ﬁrst assignment, in January, 1963,
was in the Administrative Department where he had the opportunity to
'become familiar with procedures and communications between dealerships
and the District Oﬂice. In four months he moved ahead to the Sales Plan-
ning and Analysis Department as an analyst. He studied dealerships in
terms of sales history, market penetration and potentials, and model mix.
This information was then incorporated into master plans for the District.
In March, 1964, he was promoted to Zone Manager—working directly with
- 19»dealers as a consultant on all phases of their complex operations. This
involves such areas as sales, ﬁnance, advertising, customer relations and
business management. Responsible job? You bet it is—especially for a man
not yet 25 years old. Over one million dollars in retail sales, annually, are
involved in just one dealership Steve contacts.

BILL DEL VECCHIO Dlaces fourth in the 600-yard
run in the IC4A tournament held in New York
City's Madison Square Garden. Luddy Hayden

By RON SHEARER
NEW YOR-K——Bill DelVecchio was the
only Panther to score points in the IC4A
competition held in Madison Square Garden
on Saturday. Villanova won the team cham-

pionship for the seventh time in the last
nine years by outdistancing second-place
Maryland, 24 points to 21 and one - half
points. , .

To score the two points that he garnered, Del-
Vecchio finished fourth in the 600-yard run. The
ﬁnal standings were determined on fastest times
of the two sections of finals run. DelVecchio won
both his qualifying heat in the afternoon, and his
section in the evening finals, but had only the’
fourth fastest ‘time of the competitors.

Track Coach Carl Rees felt that DelVecchio
could have won the crown inthe 600, but he had
to run in both of the slow sections, and never did.
get to compete against Ed Duchini of Georgetown,
who won the event. “

Of the other six men that Coach‘Rees took to
New York, only Luddy Hayden qualified for the

was the only other Panther to place respectably,
taking a sixth place in the broad jump.

ﬁnals in his event, the broad jump. Hayden fin-
ished sixth in the final, which was one position too
low to score any points. His distance was 23 feet
two and three-quarter inches. -

John Bailey, Dave Eichenlaub, Jim Flanigan
and Damien Koch all failed to place well enough
in the qualifying trials to make the final in their
events, while Dick. Crout made it as far as the
semi-ﬁnals in the 60-yard dash. Crout won his
quarter-ﬁnal heat, but got a bad start in the
semis and killed any chance he might have ha
to make the ﬁnals. V

Coach Rees took the poor showing by his ath-
letes rather philosophically. “I was disappointed
in John Bailey and Damien Koch,” he said, “I was
sure they would give stronger performances than
they did'.” About Jim Flanigan, “if Flanigan had
put the shot the same as his best distance in regu-
lar season meets, it wouldn’t have been enough.

“The competition was exceptionally keen, I
thought some team would score at least 30 points
and rum off with the championship, I’m sure more
teams scored in the meet than ever before in its
history.”

BOB LOVETI‘ scores a basket as Brian Fisher (20) and Jim LaValley
look on. The Panthers closed out their season Saturday when they
lost to Miami of Ohio, 89-66. The Panthers ended the season with
17 losses.

_ By FRANK snnzm
March came in like a lion and the Panther basketball
team went out like a lamb. The hoopsters dropped their sev-
enteenth game of the season as the ' Miami of Ohio squad
Won a runaway, 89-66.

“We were close until the end of the first half and then
their board strength and shooting were too much for us,”
said coach Bob Timmons. The Miami team was looking for
its 20th victory and had .a hot hand while downing the visitors.

The chief problem the Panthers had was containing J eﬁ Gehring,
high scoring center for the Redskins. He scored 27 points and became
the second leading scorer in Redskin history and the ﬁrst Miami
player to‘ score over 400 points in each of his three varsity seasons.

“Gehring only needed 11 points to get his record and when he
got those 11 he still had a hot hand and naturally tried to add on as
many points as he could,” said Timmons. Gehring hit on ten out of
11 from the ﬁeld and seven out of nine from the free throw line.

The Panthers also had trouble as they have had all season in get-
ting the key rebound. Miami wasn’t much taller than the Panthers
but they dominated the boards. The main difference, -according to
'I‘immons, was the jumping ability of six-foot-six Dinkins.

“Dinkins can really jump, has good moves and is strong around
the basket. Bob Jackson a six foot three guard can also jump and he
helped out under the boards as did Gehring.” Dinkins led Miami in
rebounds the whole year and also maintained around a ten point
average per game.

Timmons rates Miami as deﬁnitely being a tournament club.

“They are in the same type of class that West Virginia, Penn State -

and Temple are.” Miami, however, is only tied with Ohio University
for the mid-American Conference Championship and will have to
play off with them to gain the right to go to the NCAA Tournament.

Since the Panthers won’t be going to any tournaments it was
the last game for two of the starters. Captain Daryle Ruby and guard
Brian Fisher ﬁnished up their collegiate basketball careers. Ruby had
only nine points,~but he still ﬁnished the season as high scorer. Fish-
er, on the other hand, who was averaging only six points per game
tallied 15 points in the farewell.

“We couldn't rebound against them, but the guards played an
excellent game as they have the entire last part of the season," said
Timmons. “Their defense was tremendous as they stole the ball often
and Larry Szykowny was high scorer with 20 points to go along with
Fishers 15.”

High scorer for the Redskins was Gehring with 27 points.‘The
Miami coach, however, substituted freely to give the crowd of 2,557
in the small ﬁeld house a chance to cheer the starters as they left
the door. Coach Dick Shrider used all his men as the score got be-

yondthe Panther’s reach.

Bill Bodle Ends Wrestling Career;
Coach Peery Praises His Efforts

By BILL CABIN ,

There was no glory in
wrestling for Bill Bodle. Yet
he continued to wrestle‘: week
after week this year receiv-
ing beatings from his oppon-
ents and abuse from fans.

“Bodle began wrestling too late
and just doesn't have the skills,”
said coach Rex Peery. “But he’s
done a terriﬁc job, and I really
appreciate his staying with the
team."

Bodle began wrestling here in
his sophomore year having had
no previous experience. He alter-
nated in the 191 and heavyweight
divisions, compiling a 1-6 record.
His victory came by forfeit when
a Virginia Tech wrestler was in-
jured.

Peery began the season with
a depleted squad and Bodle and
Bill Beck were the only heavy-
weights. Beck had an 0-4 record
before quitting the squad three
weeks ago, but Bodle remained.

“We’ve been’ short-handed in
the heavier weights all season,”
said Peery, “and there was noth-
ing we could do because we just
didn’t have the men to ﬁll the
spots. There are a lot of guys in

‘this school who could have come

out for those positions, but most
of them just sit around on their
backsides.”

Bodle went against six mon-
sters this season, and it often
seemed like an act of persecu-
tion instead of a wrestling match.
Purdue’s 300-pound goliath Bob
Hopp lit e r ally rolled over
Bodle before beating him, 10-0,

‘BILL BODLE
Pride Without Glory
and Lehigh’s 240-pounder John
Illengwarth pinned Bodle in 38
seconds.

Bodle, however, takes it with a
smile. “If there’s one thing this
sport taught me, it’s humility,”
he said jokingly. “I used to be
a cocky guy, but now I appreci-
ate others,” he said with another
burst of laughter.

ANDY KUZNESKI

MESEIER

THE PENN MUTUAL Lirr: INSURANCE

COMPANY

Andy Kuzneski graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1962 as did John Mesher in
1960. In addition to being active in campus organizations, both represented the Panthers in athle-
tics. Andy was a member of the football squad and John of the basketball team during their

Both joined the James E. Eckenrode, Jr., Agency in Pittsburgh immediately after graduation.

 

 

Each qualiﬁed as a member of the Company Presidents Club after their ﬁrst year. Andy and John
are good examples of the many college men who join Penn Mutual. As such, the following’ inter-
view with them should be of interest to men now concerned with choosing a career . . . a career
that can be entered immediately upon graduation , with starting salary up to $700 per month.

WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE ON A LIFE INSURANCE CAREER. ANDY?

There were many reasons. I like the idea of unlimited opportunity for personal progress
and earning potential. I wanted‘ a challenging job .. ., and one that brought recognition with ac-
complishment. I also wanted the satisfaction of helping other people . . . and the prestige that
comes from being part of an important profession. ‘

WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE ON PENN MUTUAL AND ECKENRODE AGENCY. JOHN?

This Company has had an outstanding record in the insurance industry for over 100 years.
It has been represented in Pittsburgh for 86 of those years. The Eckenrode Agency has come to
be known throughout the Company as "The Agency of Progress." This success has been brought
about by the dynamic leadership of our General Agent, a thorough training program, and the warm
friendly atmosphere which has the proper combination of the drive and enthusiasm of
youth, coupled with the wisdom and technique of years of experience.

7 Our agents have an excellent record of accomplishment.

For example, six of our associates are members of the Penn Mutual Million Club. Manage-
ment qualities do not_go unnoticed either. In the past,nin,eteen years this Agency has produced 16 _
general agents, and _vice-presidents,_and the ﬁrst president of the Institute of Life Insurance Holgar
J. Johnson, who incidentally, is a Pitt graduate.

WHAT KIND OF TRAINING HAVE YOU HAD. JOHN-?

A comprehensive program of classroom work and on-the-job experience for the first three
years.

IN SUMMARY. ANDY. WHAT TYPE OF MAN SHOULD CHOOSE A CAREER

IN INSURANCE?
It isn't so much his background or education that should be considered, as it is the _type
of person. He should have ambition and drive, with a desire to do well on his own. If he is ‘per-

sonable and mature, wants success and is willing to work for it, that man should certainly look
into life insurance. Long and hard.

Young men of ability can get to the top fast at
Boeing; Today, Boeing's business backlog is
just under two billion dollars, of which some
60 per cent is in commercial jetliner and heli-
copter product areas. The remainder is in mili-
tary programs and government space flight
contracts. This gives the company one of the
most stable and diversified business bases in
the aerospace industry. ’

No matter where your career interests |ie—
in the commercial jet airliners of the future
or in space-flight technology——you can find
an opening of genuine opportunity at Boeing.
The company’s world leadership in the jet
transport field is an indication of the calibre
of people you'd work with at Boeing.

Boeing is now pioneering evolutionary ad-
vances in the research, design, development
and manufacture of civilian and military air-
craft of the future, as well as space programs
of such historic importance as America's first
moon landing. Gas turbine engines, transport
helicopters, marine vehicles and basic re-
search are other areas of Boeing activity.

Whether your career interests lie in basic or
applied research, design, test, manufacturing
or administration, there's a spot where your
talents are needed at Boeing. Engineers, math-
ematicians and scientists at Boeing work in
small groups, so initiative and ability get max-
imum exposure. Boeing encourages participa-
tion in the company-paid Graduate Study
Program at leading colleges and universities
near company installations.

We're looking forward to meeting engineering,
mathematics and science seniors and graduate
students during our visit to your campus. Make
. an appointment now at your placement ofﬁce.
