Engineers Feature “Doltble or Nothing”

At “Slide Rule Swing” at WilliamiPenn

Pitt’ engineers have spoofed ate

the superstition of unlucky Fri-
day the 13th by scheduling the
biggest and most elaborate dance
of the school year on that day—-
April 13, Friday. The dance, "The
Slide Rule Swing,” will be held in
the main ballroom, and the Adonis
room of the William Penn hotel
from 8:30 to 11:3-0 o’clock. Chair-
man Tom Vasilaros has announc-
ed there will be continuous music
for the three hours with no inter-
missions.

An unusual feature of “The
Slide Rule -Swing" will be the
use of two orchestras, Brad Hunt’s
and Clyde Knig.ht’s, it has been
announced «by the chairman. The
cost’ of tickets will be $3.00 per
couple. '

Engineers on the dance commit-
tee : are: Fred Rhodes, business
manager; Greg Betz, t-ifcket chair-
man,‘ assisted by Alex Fino; Bill
Ross and Marietta Kerinedy, pub-
licity chairmen; Dick. Hargrave,
head of the invitationsconnnittee,



 

and Fred Baur, in charge of dec-
orations.

Concerning Pitt students’ par-
ticipation and support of “The
Slide Rule Swing” Tom Vasilaros
said, .“In the «past couple of months
the topic most commonly discussed
has been Pitt’s dances. Sinqe
everyone was -talking about it and
no one was doing anything, the
E & .M cabinet decided to take a
chance and hold one of the biggest
school dances in years. The pur-
pose',of this dance is to satisfy
everyone. Two of Pittsburgh’s
largest bands were engaged in
order" to have two styles of con-
tinuous music throughout the eve-
ning.iWe chose the ballroom of
the William Penn hotel because
we considered it to be one of the
most ‘attractive in Pittsburgh. And
since the E & M cabinet was tak-
ing a- chance on everything being
undertaken, it was also decided to
take ‘a chance on the date—Fri-
day,"April 13. However. we feel
we’re' not taking such a big
chance- with the students. We

 

know they’ll back us up and go all
out for the dance. “The Slide Rule
Swing” is open t, the entire stu-
dent body, not only to the engi-
neers, and we’re really banking
on everyone’s being there.”

Gregg Betz has announced that
tickets for this dance are now
being sold throughout the Uni-
versity. Students will also be able
to purchase tickets at the booth
on the ground ﬂoor at an early
date.

Engineer Tom Sherrick has
voiced the general enthusiasm of
the engineers concerning “The
Slide Rule Swing” in these words.
“The E & M -cabinet, the chair-
man an-d committee members have
polled their ideas and inspirations
for the common cause. Cause why?
Cause we want a good dance!”

Roy F. Reinhard, treasurer of
the. Engineering and Mines Asso-
ciation, said, “If the college sup-
ports this -dance, once again it
will be known that successful
dances are possible during. such
critical times. .

Wei; in '3/zeepi Glaf/aim;

We were just looking at the plans for the twelfth ﬂoor the
other day, as we do occasionally, and were impressed all over

the ﬁrst twelfth ﬂoor was.

i again with what a veritable “heaven” it should be when com-
pleted. On the other hand it could beas dismal a failure as '
And that was a sad affair.

Ask

anyone: the girls on WSGA or Senior court, the dean of wom-
en’s oﬁice, or just any of the 25 or so boys and girls who fre-

quented the ﬂoor.

Why was the ﬁrst project a failure? Because it didn’t ful-

ﬁll its avowed purpose.

It was not a place Where students

could enjoy themselves informally. Oh yes, there were a few
comfortable chairs to sit down on and a ping pong table that

hicould be set up, and there were very charming people in one

corner of that floor with whom to talk, if anything bothered
you. But real informality (and by that I don ’t mean rowdi-

ness) ‘I None!

Commission, in their ﬁrst discussion of the new twelfth

1 A ﬂoor, proposed as their prime aim that this will be a ﬂoor to be

lived in. They want it to be a bright cheery place that students
will want to visit’; they want it to be the focal point of student
activity. This it could be, at least to a certain degree, but for
one thing. That is that the new ﬂoor as planned will be exactly

A the same as the unsuccessful old, only under a new guise. It
, will be the same old wolf in sheep’s clothing.

At that Commission meeting when we voiced our doubts and

sidered later.

i’ stated reasons, they were brushed aside as details to be con-
We conceded the point, but they are very im-

portant details that should be decided upon as soon as the “cor-
ner stone” is laid, if not before, for it is upon these details that

the success of the ﬂoor depends.

To start at the beginning, all will agree that in order to

i get students onto the elevators and up to the twelfth ﬂoor, it

must oﬁer attractions, if not better, at least equal to those of

the handier Tuck Shops.

Probably, it will draw only those stu-

dents with an entire morning or afternoon free.
“What about smoking on the twelfth ﬂoor?” ask we who
remember when. Commission thinks not. After all, for the non-

smoker that nasty choking haze is not pleasant.

There are no

statistics that I know.of on the subject, but I would guess that
over half (conservatively) of the student body and faculty

smoke.

That means that over half of the possible population

‘oftthe ﬂoor, including Commission, will be dying for a smoke,

Round two coming up. In the Pine Social ‘room, the room
where students will get gay to the point of kicking off, their

have a radio-phonograph machine and a ﬁne collection ofrecords,
ranging from heavy works such as Shostakovich to the light and

romantic Strauss Waltzes.

One of us ventured to inquire about

bothered to deﬁne what the “presence” was exactly. But, as

(NOTE: Several people have
told me recently that this column
is getting corny. (Who do they
think I am, Franklin P. Adams?)
So today, as an experiment, I’m
submitting a strictly un-ho-omerus
column. Please leave all com-
plaints and -threatening letters in
the Cwen box!)

SPRING has come again to the
city. This morning I awakened to
a day all unfamiliar gold and_tur-
quoise, shot through with threads
of bird calls, and found that spring
had come in the night. Spring in
the city means sunlight again and
the ﬁrst tiny, crumpled leaves
softening the harsh twigs of the
barberry hedges; it means poplar
“worms” squashily littering the
walks and piling up in the gut-
ters; it means chestnut trees, with
their ﬂoreate candles, and pat-
terns of chestnut blossoms fallen
on young green grass. Spring
means the return of the organ
grinder, cranking out the tortured
strains of The Isle of Capri to the
delight of a crowd of capering
urchins; the ball-bearing sound of
roller skates and home-made
scooters. It means hanks of shiny
green and purple Easter grass,
pussywillow catkins on all the
teachers’ desks, and seedling com-
ing up in the ﬁfth grade window
boxes. 

To the housewife, spring is the
ﬂap of dustmops, the mingled
odors of fr-esh paint an-d dinners
cooking and the damp earthy
smell of freshly dug ﬂower beds.
It is looking out the kitchen win-
dow an-d seeing lily-of-the-valley
spikes pushing “up -through last
year’s comp-ost of leaves. It is
muddy footprints on the carpets

Darliiigton Librarian

Addresses Quota Club

At a recent meeting of the
Quota club, Mrs. Lois Mulkearn,
librarian of Pitt’s Darlington li-
brary, told members of the Darl-
ington collection.

She said, “Since the Quota club
members are b1.lSlIlL’S.- and profes-
sional women, the books selected
for this exhibition are on various
subjects. However, some were in-
cluded on account of their beauti-
ful bindings, while others are
shown as examples of early print-
ings and bindings.”

Mrs. Mulkearn then discussed
books by various authors, includ-
ing Dickens and Thackeray.

and a heady scent of lilacs

through soft, warm rain.

Spring at Pitt means the ice-
cream man outside of State hall,
forsythia in bloom along the up-
per campus drives, shaftsof dusty
sunlight in a deserted Commons
room and a row of pink crabap-
ple trees along the Forbes street
terrace. It means walking in
Schenley park: clumps of trillium
and Dutch=man’s breeches strug-
gling up -from the valley bottom in
Panther hollow, Judas unfolding
its red buds beside the lake; the
swoop and dip of kites on Flag-
staff hi1l;..,old men on the park
benches, straining their faces to-
ward the sun; babies, and nurse-
maids, and children sucking
dandelionstems to make the
curl. ‘

Spring in the city is a nostalgia
and an awakening. It is bright
days; and windy nights when
clouds scu-d, shadow and silver,
over the moon; an-d warm, dim
evenings with the fragrance of
hyacinths ﬂoating across the town.

Lee Mclnerney

Several girls living in women’s

- fraternity houses on campus were

pretty willing to give me a plot
for the year's best play the other
week. They volunteered the facts
and all the itrim-mings. So we’re
off.

Scene: Almost any women’s
fraternity house on campus.

Time: Noon to 6 p. in. Sunday.

Characters: Gert, Mert, and
Mary Louise.

As the curtain rises, Mert walks
over to the left sid.e of the room.

Gert: I’m~hungry.

Mert: Naturally.

Mary Louise: Naturally.

Curtain falls. End of play.
Moral: Watta, ya expect for ﬁfﬁ
dollars? ‘ ‘

It seems, according to the lovely
women around here, that boarders
at Pitt ‘frat houses are not given:
any food at lunch and dinner on

Sundays. This new ruling came.

into effect at the beginninggof last
semester. Any girl who wishes to
eat after breakfast must go out
and buy he-r meals or not eat.
(Nice alternative, what?) ,
Scuttlebut has it that the rea-
son for this new ruling is that
cooks will not work on Sundays
in these war days. Dravo and what
not is calling. Therefore, it is im-
possible for meals to be prepared
in the houses on that day.
‘Reasonably enough, the girls
understand the predicament. Their
complaint isn't concerned with
that fact. They have only three
questions: Why must they pay the
same price as last year for their
room and board when they are not

receiving the amout of food? Why i
aren’t they given money for their -

two Sunday meals as on other
days when it is impossible for

meals to be served in the house? ’
Is this same condition going to’

exist next year?

It certainly must be admitted
that the girls have the right to ask
these questions. For some reason,
a great many of them exist on
peanut butter and crackers all day
Sunday. A likely cause for this is
they haven’t the money to buy
food. Maybe they should: have it,
but that’s beside the point.
They’re not getting proper nour-
ishment. Isn’t it under the juris-
diction of the University to see

that these girls are taken care-

of properly?

‘These girls who board are not
unwilling to go out to a nearby
restaurant for their Sunday meals.
But there’s such a thing as money
that’s needed to enforce one’s pro-
per dignity on proprietors, no mat-
ter.ho'w good natured theymight
be. (Notice the word might).

If there is a better reason for
their not receiving meals, then it
should be explained to them. As
things stand now, they feel as
though they’re being pushed
around.

It's late in the year to bring up
this subject, but the girls suffered
a long time before they mentioned
it to me. There's little that would
be undertaken at this date; still,
there’s always next year. .

Peanut butter and crackers,
Gosh!

Magerus Talks on Paris

sationalist at the University, will

Students M eekly Suggest

“Turnabout is fair play” our student body asserts.

Seriously con-

sidering their own quirks, Pitt students have meekly suggested that
the faculty have their little idiosyncrasies (yes, they do too!) and
who knows-—someone could proﬁt by these half exposures.

The complaint of complaints is short notice on majors and papers!

Gee whiz, even the OPA gives you 90 days.

Strangely enough, this

seems -to be the only overall grouch that the students have to make.

The following are runners-up ine

the Get-it—off-your-chest contest.
Of these, dull lectures take a
prominent place among the Pitt-
V ites’ gripes. The bright-eyed
brainwaves who mentioned bore-
dom in the classroom had no sug-
gestions for amelioration of the
condition, though one left wing
co-ed advanced her theory on the
educational system in general.
‘She believes there is not enough
material covered, there is too
much irrelevant matter discussed,
and that there should be more use
made of visual education. Wow!

A .few -cold-blooded individuals
object to those fresh-air ﬁends
who throw open the windows and
breathe rapturously the crystal air
of Pittsburgh’s East End. What
to do, what to do? Close the win-
dow and antagonize the prof, or

. . Ah-Choo!

The prize, though, was the dra-
‘matic fellow who, condescendingly
admitting that he was a person,
‘hated to be called ‘a people.’

“applicant will be enrolled for two,
three, or four twelve-week terms.

A The amount of academic credit he
receives for this training will be
determined by the institution to
which he is assigned.

While in training the student is
not subject to military law, but he
must conform to the rules and
regulations of the college or uni-
versity to which he is assigned.

The government pays the cost of
tuition, room, board, textbooks,

"vimedical care,~and library and ath-
letic privileges. The government
also issues, without charge or de-

ceive pay.

Students in the ASTRP are

“eighteenth birthday. They are

-then assigned to a training center

Day of Liberty
Celebrated in
Greek Room

To celebrate the anniversary of
the first G.reek day of indepen-
dence over 125 years ago, the
Greek Nationality ‘Room commit-
tee will place ﬂowers and the ex-

planation of the meaning of this
day in the Greek nationality room
on ‘Monday, March 26.

Over ﬁve centuries ago the
proud nation of Greece was un-
der Turkish domination. Her c-it-
izens were subject to Turkish rule
and tax. Every Greek after his
twelfth- birthday was compelled
to pay an annual head tax for
which he received the receipt,
“The hold-er hereof may bear his
head on his shoulders for one
year.”

But the love of freed-om was not
forgotten in Greece and on the
day the Archbishop of Patras
openly raised the standards of
the cross the patriots rallied for
the ﬁght. Although numbering
less than a -million after a long
struggle, they gained their inde-
pendence and were again a free
people.

Another nationality room com-
mittee which will honor its room
is the Czechoslovakian committee
which will place sprigs of laurel
around the picture of Comenius
on Wednesday, March: 28. Comen-
ius was a fervent Czechoslovakian
patriot and also the founder of
the modern method of education.
Besides being a preacher of hu-
manity, Comenius was the last
bishop of Moravian Brethren.

The Moravian Brethren of Penn-

sylvania are a living monument to
his memory.

Grove Speaks 

On Counseling

Last Saturday afternoon’s meet-
ing of the Institute on health
problems of the returning veteran
featured an address on veteran
counseling by Dr. William Grove,
associate professor of psychology,
here at the University.

Also included on the program
were addresses by Dr. Grosvenor
B. Pearson, Director of Western
State Psychiatric hospital and Dr.
Robert A. Clark, clinical director

of the Western State Psychiatric

hospital.

Dr. ‘Pearson _said that the veterg

an’s administration is doing a
good job in proportion to the facili-
ties available at the present time.
“The Veteran’s Administration is
anxious to help men and women
who have bona ﬁde claims.

“It is not evading its problems,
but is trying to solve them. Its
problems are mountainous,” he
added.

Dr. Clark spoke on problems and 1

opportunities in psychiatric re-

habilitation. To help the veteran, ‘

he urged, “more psychiatric clinics,
more education, and more eco-
nomic opportunities.” Fortun-
ately, according to Dr. Clark, some
communities are already taking
measures to help their returned
servicemen.

It "A  I.-"our

 ﬂan!

By Margie Long

Sure and you know St. Patrick’s
day was March 17. Well, begorra

‘if the Tri Delts didn’t have a St.

Patrick’s Day dance for their
pledges. Their new pledge ofﬁcers
are: Peggy Dougherty, president;
Betty Rogers, secretary; Elly
Lynch, treasurer; and Grace
Bowen, Junior Panhellenic repre-
sentative. The girls are having a

"bridge tea for the Kappas on Fri-

day.

The Phi Mu pledges also honored
St. Patrick by having a spaghetti
dinner for the actives lost Mon-
day night.

“Pin-up Swing” is the theme of
the Beta Sigs’ tea dance this aft-
ernoon for all the pledges of men’s
fraternities. The dance is to be in
honor of their new pledges. I
wonder, could the theme have any-
thing to do with the Betas’ pin-up
wall where Van Johnson takes
spot of honor?

Also today, the Thetas are hold-
ing open house from 3:30 to 5
o’clock in honor of their pledges.
On Friday night Ellen Ludwig
Fisher is having a party at her
home for all Theta sisters. The
alumnae_ also gave them a party
last Tuesday. -

At the Zeta Tau Alpha alumnae
banquet last Thursday Betty Ellen
Whitten presented Marmy Brown
with the scholarship ring for hav-
ing the highest scholastic average
of all Zetas this year.

The A E Phis have joined the
Hospital Aid corps and have been
doing clerical work at the vari-
ous hospitals.

New Chi Omega pledge officers
are Eloise Fiand, first sponsor;
Peggy Thompson, second sponsor;
Shirley Clayton, activities chair-
man; and Norma Mervosh, Junior
Panhel representative.

The Kappas are having a tea
dance for the Phi Delts today at
their house, and on Friday, they
will get together with their Tech
sisters for a scavenger hunt. R

Last Friday the TPAS held open
house for all women’s fraternities
in honor of their pledges.

According to Mahoney-

Mahoney tells us that the Phi
Eps have another new pledge in
the person of Marty Rubenstein.
The Pilot House—or, “We believe
between a swimming pool and a
dance hall”——dwellers also tossed
a swimming party last Friday aft-
ernoon. The party was in honor
of “Bunker Hill day,” which we
all look forward to celebrating on
June 23rd.

The Pi Lams start the celebra-
tion of their ﬁftieth anniversary
with a joint stag with their alumni
tomorrow evening at their chapter
house.

The Phi Gams celebrated the
week by announcing the addition
of three new pledges, bringing
their total to eighteen.

"Having entertained the Tri-
Delts at an afternoon tea dance
last Wednesday, the Delts rounded
out the week by having a gala St.
Patrick’s day dance Saturday

Hi-light of the PiKA week-end
was a dance held last Friday at
the Clyde street retreat.

The SAEs are playing host this
Friday to the Phi Kaps and TPAS.
The occasion of the party is still
being held secret.

The seclusion of the South Park
lodge is the scene of a “Rough-
and-Ready” brawl held by the
Phi Kaps in conjunction with the
Phi Gams. Anyone found in dress
clothes will be quietly thrown in
the river at the stroke of midnight
with a -copy of Etiquette, by Emily
Post tied with silken thread to
each foot.

George Whitten is the most re-
cent addition to the Phi Delt
pledge class. This however is not
to be associated with the fact that
it has recently been rumored in
underground quarters that the Phi
Delt pledges are planning some-
thing big for the actives. The na-
ture of the affair has not as yet
been revealed, but suspicion was
aroused when two pledges were
seen entering the house with a
roll of gauze and two phials of
Egyptian embalming ﬂuid.

Released Prisoner-of- War

Speaks to Students, Faculty

By Tillie Sanker
Private Frank Battaglia, Pitt student of 1939-40, who fought with
the First Infantry division, was captured by the Germans, and held
in as many as twelve different prison camps, will speak to the stu-
dent body and faculty next Wednesday, March 28, in Room 132 at

3:30 o’clock.

Presented through the courtesy of Student congress, Pvt. Battaglia
will tell his personal ideas about how the Germans should be treated

after the Allies’ victory.

In thc¢

fewest. possible words he disclosed
his sentiments.

“Annihilate them,” he said.

Pvt. Battaglia, in service three
years and one month, fought with
the First division through the
North African campaign. He is
a veteran of the battles of Kas-

 

Pvt. Frank Battaglia

serine, pass, the famous Hill 609,
and the Battle of Altare in which
he was taken prisoner by the Ger-
mans.

In his two years as a prisoner
he was in twelve different prison

camps. After his capture by the
Germans he was given to the Ital-
ians, then retaken by the Germans
and sent into Germany.

“They had very bad food. Treat-
ment of the prisoners was very
rough. The American Red Cross
would give us clothes and then the
Germans would come and take
them from us.”

While in Germany, Pvt. Bat-
taglia worked in a sugar beet fac-
tory.

When asked how he was taken
prisoner, the husky, d»ark—haired
soldier said, “We were ﬁghtingat
Altare.
when I woke up I was a prisoner.

To my surprise, it was six weeks,

later. I had lain unconscious all

Who may have seemed slight-

It was coming; it was coming;

it came! Last night at 7:38 o’clock
Eastern War-Time, spring made

its official debut. Here at Pitt,
numerous changes are. (it is
hoped) expected to accompany

the incoming spring season.

The angry glares of Tuck Shop
waitresses will give way to soft,
friendly, slightly bewildered
stares. The prof who gave you a
D plus on that last theme will step
it up to a strong lusty C minus

Tuck Shop habitues will desert
their usual haunts for a little
“lawn lounging” in front of the

To show the effect of spring on

Three-way Race To Be Decided’

This Week; SAEs 0ut In Front

As the final week of I-F com-9

petition rolls around. it appears as
if it has boiled down to a race be-

tween the SAES, the Phi Gams,

and the Phi Eps. The SAES, sport-
ing ﬁve straight wins, maintain

s the to-p position of the league;

close behind are the Phi Gams
and.’ the Phi Eps. each having ﬁve
wins and one loss. This week the
Phi Eps, the Phi Gams, and the
PiKAs will‘ meet the SAES. The
outcome of these crucial battles
will determine the league cham-
pionship. Last week was a repeti-
tion of every previous week. The
strong teams of the league contin-
ued to trounce their opponents

ywith comparative eas-e. The only

unexpected defeat was the Pi Lam
upset of the PiKAs. This loss vir-
tually eliminated the PiKAs from
championship consideration.

SAEs Roll On
Increasing their victory string

to ﬁve straight the SAES white-
washed the Phi Delts 58 to 27. The

 P. game was one-sided as the SAES
 .-dominated the play. Most of the

points were scored from the

B 2. banking boards as the SAE height

was overwhelming. A new bright
spot appeared for the SAEsv as Cris
Lucy hit his stride. Towering over

, the smaller Phi Delts Lucy had no

trouble as he scored almost at will.
* * *

Bouncing back from their sec-

ond loss of the season the PiKAs

_ roared back to surprise the high-
yriding SAES. Deliberate playing

team headed its opponents by
more than four points. In the clos-
ing minutes of play the SAES scor-
ed three continuous points as they
grabbed a one-point lead. With
ﬁfteen seconds remaining Linelli
ﬁred a long one from the center.
As the ball rebounded from the
board Valenchik of the PiKAs
was fouled by an onrushing SAE.
He promptly dropped in the foul
to tie the score at 30 to 30. How-
ever, the SAES claimed that the
game was over before Valenchik
was fouled. The bitter dispute that
resulted caused both teams to
leave the floor. The ﬁnal decision
on this matter came when Les
Sarules, I-F athletic chairman,
ruled that a ﬁve minute overtime
should be played. The team scor-
ing the most points in this period
will be the winner.
Pi Lams Win Two

The Pi Lams returned to the
I-F picture this week in the ca-
pacity of giant killers. Aided tre-
mendously by their mid-season ad-
ditions, the Pi Lams blossomed
forth as the surprise team of the
league. Led by Fred Klein the Pi
Lams upset the PiKAs 41 to 34. It
was a closely contested battle
throughout as the Pi Lams were
only able to cinch it in the last 30
seconds. The PiKAs fought bitter-

ly but were never able to gain
control of the bank boards.
Gearing their high scoring ag-
gregation to the fullest extent the
Pi Lams smothered the Phi Delts
96 to 17. High man for the vic-

tors was Howard Beck who rack- '

ed up 30 points.
Phi Eps Move Up

Rejuvenated spirit kept the high— -’ i 7.
riding Phi Ep "quintet, intact this _ .. "

week. Using mostly their second
stringers, the Phi Eps beat the
Delts 40 to 27, and the Phi Kaps
51 to 38. New faces broke into the
box score, as Jack Pincus, Bob
Pearlman, Jack Bloom, Bernie
Latter-man, and Mel Snitzer led
the Phi Ep scoring in both games.
For the Delts Jimmy Ludwig
shone with his brilliantly executed
overhand pitches. The Phi Kaps
featured Larry Burwinkle who
scored 15 points against this high-

ly touted defensive Phi Ep team. .

These two one-sided victories en-
abled the Phi Eps to climb into a
second-place tie with the Phi
Gams. /

Phi Gams Top Delts

Retaining their second place in
the I-F! standings, the Phi Gams
defeated the Delts in a hard
fought battle 42 to 30. Expecting
an easy game, the Phi Gams were
surprised when they realized that
the Delts intended to put up a
struggle. However, superior abil-
ity for-ced the Delts to succumb
to the Phi Gams. Starring for the
Phi Gams was Les Sarules who
has become their mainstay. The
Phi Gams d.o not play again un-
til they meet the SAES. This game
will go far in determining the
ﬁnal standings of the basketball
league.

NCAA To" Get Started

The Panthers might consider
themselves lucky that they didn’t
receive a bid to one of the New
York tournaments. Today the Pitt
team isn’t as strong a.s it was at
the time they called it quits in
Morgantown. D o d o Canterna
wished his team-mates goodbye
early in March, when Uncle Sam
sent him an invitation with an
R.S.V.P. engraved at the bottom
and- Oland accepted. Then last
week Tay Malarkey took a spill
and snapped a tendon in one of
his ﬁngers. Had Pitt been’ heading
for New York they would have
two holes in their starting lineup
which would be "impossible to ﬁll.

Dr. Carlson ﬁnds it much easier
to read about the tournaments
than to take part in the tussle.
The doctor in his recent publica-
tion, “Basketball Research and
Fatigue,” proved that a coach goes
through a great ordeal, as far as
heartbeat is conc~er,ned, during a
basketball game. Before the con-

test the coaches’ heartbeat rate is
very -high, but as the contest pro-
gresses it tends to reach normality.

Tomorrow night marks the
opening of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournaments
at Madison Square Gardens. How-
ard Cann’s' hat must have brought
his New York University basket-
ball team good luck, because out
of the receptacle came th-e glad
tidings that his quintet would
meet lightly regarded Tufts, Dis-
trict 1 representative. A real game
looms in the other portion of the
semi-ﬁnals when Kentucky, Dis-
trict 3, swaps shots with Ohio
State, District 4. Eastern ﬁnals are
scheduled Saturday and East--
West ﬁnals, Tuesday, March 27.

Although with not an impres-
sive record of 13-7 for the season,
the surging Violets lived up to
their last two outings with smash-
ing wins over Temple and City
College. Tufts comes to town with
an 8-5 mark. The Jumbos beat
Harvard twice, MIT, Coast Guard
and Wocester Poly.

It’ll ‘be t" V second clash of the
campaign ‘between Kentucky and
Ohio State. The Wildcats, South-
eastern kings with a 21-3 slate,
-edged out the 14-4 Buckeyes, Big
Ten runner up, in an overtime
brawl at Lexington.

Pitt Freshman
Has Champions

Through Gus Krop, a freshman
in the College, Pitt will have its
hand in at least one basketball
championship this year. Gus
coaches the team of St. Casimir
High, which became Catholic High
School Basketball League cham-
pions by defeating St. Joseph High
last Thursday. They are now eligi-
ble to play St. Mary’s (Pa.) here
early next week in the Western
semi-final game in state ‘competi-
tion. If they defeat St. Mary’s,
they will represent Western Penn-
sylvania in State elimination.

Though this is only the third
year that Gus has been at the
helm, he has brought St. Casimir
its first championship in Catholic
High League history. Last year his
boys were nosed outin the playoffs
by this same St. Joseph team. This
year’s victory, therefore, was
doubly gratifying.

C-oach Krop’s boys meet St.
Mary’s at 8:30 o’clock Tuesday
night on the Duquesne University
floor for the PCIAA Western
Regional “B” honor. If they get
by this one, they’ll meet ‘the
Eastern regional winner in the
“B” -championship contest later
this week at an eastern location.

Their chances look pretty good,
because in dethroning St. Josephs,
they got past the team that’s held
the state championship for the last
two years in a row. '

Under Way In Metro

By Larry Bondy '

 

Dear Village Smithy:

Then, too, there were the Rose
Bowl-bound Volunteers of Ten-
nessee—just a bunch of 4-Fs,
17-year olds, and discharged vets.
They dropped football for a year,
then came back with a strictly
all-civilian squad that ended up
in Pasadena last New Year’s day.
Why pick on outstanding ex-
amples? Well, because Pitt could
be at the top of the heap if they
wanted to.

Pennsylvania produces the best
football material in the nation--»
barring none. They come from
mines, -mills, factories, and fields.
Tiheytve -been drilled and coached
through r u g g e d, practice-ﬁlled
high schol days. They’re rock-
ribbed, iron-legged, swivel-hip-
ped. Yet how many top-notchers
do we get here at the University

. . not just mediocre but really
good.

Did you ever hear of a football
player leaving the state of Minne-
sota? Of course not, the spirit’s
there in addition to ‘the’ talent.
Boys in the iron-ore-land never
consider anything but Bernie
Bierman’s Golden Gophers. The
sam-e goes for Ohio State. High
school powerhouses like Canton
and Massillon graduate their boys
to the Buckeye University. It
could happen here. WPIAL class
‘AA’ schools ﬁeld excellent teams.
Now compare the number who
are graduated and subsequently
enroll at various other big"-name
colleges alongside those who wind

Pitt was one of the country’s all-civilian outfits yet that
doesn’t mean they were a criterion of the brand of civilian ball ‘
that was played last season. Glance at the record of Ohio State.
The Scarlet Scourge swept tlll‘0l1g'h ii nine-game schedule,
knocked oif some service-stutlded schools like Michigan and
Great Lakes, and copped the Big Ten title to boot. Alslcivilian

up at Pitt. We’ve lost the name,
the magic -touc'h that had them
ﬂocking here in the ’30s. That
same feeling can be rebuilt .

but not in a half-hearted manner.
Remember that Shaughnessy was
great at Stanford -because he had
Norm Standlee, Frankie Albert,
Pete Kmetovic, and Hugh Galler-
neau romping around in his back-

rnatriculate at the Palo Alto Uni-
versity.

Perhaps a change has already
been effected, but, to go one
further, how much of a change?
its claimed were getting better
football material: well" why aren't
we getting the best?‘ Last season
Joe Gasparella, Johnny Mastr:3iri=
gelo, and Nunzio Marino ended up
under the majestic spires of Notre
Dame. They were from Western
Pennsylvania . . at least, geo-

tory. Of late, city high school stars
have gone to colleges like Ten-
nessee, Penn State, an-d more re-
cently, the University of Georgia.
Let’s not be middle-of-the-road
about this thing. Be fair and hon-
est with ourselves. If we prosely-
tize fair players, ethically, we’re
just as sinful as if we’d gone after
the stars.

We can regain that old time Pitt
spirit and prestige. We can pack
our stadium with 70,000 cheering,
wild-eyed fans. Or . . we can
do it as the University of Chicago
-did drop everything and
make no pretense of it. Let’s not
straddle the fence. If we want
mplayers to come here -let's do it
the BIG WAY OR NOT AT ALL.
