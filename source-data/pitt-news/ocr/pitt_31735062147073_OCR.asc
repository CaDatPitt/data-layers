Freshman Issue

Student Counseiors Begin
Men’s Orientation Program

Upperclassmen To Aid
In Revised, Enlarged
First Year Plan

Freshman men will meet their coun-
selors tomorrow afternoon, between
3:30 and 4:30 o’clock. Complete in-
structions regarding the new upper-
classman counselor program were
given to the advisers at a meeting yes-
terday morning, conducted by N. Rob-
ert Seidle, assistant to the dean of
men.

With the cooperation of the faculty,
the office of the dean of men is in-
troducing a new freshman orientation
plan. In place of the College Orienta-
tion classes, which were attended by
freshmen in the past, a more com-
plete all—freshman orientation program
will be a required ﬁrst-semester sub-
ject for all freshmen, except those
enrolled in the Schools of Engineering
and Mines. The freshmen will be di-
vided into sections of approximately
30 students, and to each section will
be assigned one member of the fac-
ulty or administration and three coun-
selors. 3’

The purpose of the cour_se is to ren-
der the freshman personal attention
in vocational guidance, personality de-
velopment, problems of social, study
and health adjustment, and in addition
to develop a spirit of loyalty and en-
thusiasm toward the University. To
render the program fully effective it
will be necessary for each counselor
to attend regularly one freshman sec-
tion during the ﬁrst hour of either a
Tuesday or Thursday morning.

One of the immediate responsibil-
ities of the counselors ‘will be the
superintendence of a new set of fresh-
-man customs. Freshmen will ﬁrst be
initiated into the University when
they receive their “Pitt Pins” at the
Freshman Banquet, which will take
place on "Thursday evening in the
Memorial Banquet Room. Then the

‘freshmen will "b‘e‘““expecte'd‘ to acquire‘

a knowledge of the branches of the
University, the names of the deans,
the school history, a.t least ﬁve cheers
and these four University songs:
“Panther Song,” “Hail to Pitt,” “The
Victory Chant” and “Alma Mater.”

Class badges, which will be given
for permanent possession, must be
worn at least during the traditions
period, which ends with a freshman
jamboree shortly before Thanksgiv-
ing.

Faculty Members Estimate 575
Will Receive Aid

 

Replacing the FERA as government-
sponsored student aid, the National
Youth Administration will this year
provide ﬁnancial assistance to stu-
dents on campus. .

The newly organized body. which
was put in operation by a $50,000,000
grant from the national treasury, lim-
its the number of students helped to
12 per cent of the undergraduate en-
rollment. Under such requirements.

faculty members have estimated, 575 '

men and women will be eligible for
NYA work. .

In charge of Miss Isabelle Ander-
son. assistant dean of women.‘ and
John G. Quick, registrar, the Univer-
sity part i11 the program_ will feature
an aid plan prorated by classes. Equal‘
opportunities will thus be offered to‘
freshmen and uperclassmen.

An average of $15 a month will be
employed,
Quick indicated. Maximum will be
$20 each month for individuals.

Relative need of applicants will
determine the choice of the commit-
tee of selection. Men may ﬁle re-
quests for employment with J. Clyde
Benton in .the....,Placeme11.t _B11rea31-a

The NYA schedule, it is emphasized.
will not interfere with the regular
part-time opportunities for work of-
fered through the men's and women’s
employment services. The primary re-
quirement for consideration in the
federal proiect is inability to con-
tinue at school without such assist-
ance.

Under conditions set by national
and state administrators, work given
under NYA will not conflict with la-
bor already being performed about
the camous. Supplementary plans sug-
gested include reference work and
experimental activity in ﬁelds of the
students’ major interest.

With Deans After
0peningAssembly

W. Don Harrison To Introduce
University’s Coaches Today
In Afternoon Session

University life began this morning
for the class of 1939 as it met in its
ﬁrst assembly in the main auditorium
of Memorial Hall.

Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, delivered the welcom-
ing address to the new class after be-
ing introduced by Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of men, who presided
over the meeting. °

“Where do you live?” asked Dr.
Bowman, in setting the theme of his
address. “You live in Pittsburgh, yes.

“But what is Pittsburgh? What
meaning does it have for you? Is it

. a group of buildings placed where two

rivers meet, is it a steel mill or a
factory, is it houses and grocery stores
and offices? " '

“If that is your idea.-. of Pittsburgh,
then you are on the wrong track,”
stated the Chancellor.

“Pittsburgh is more than all those
things,” he continued. “The real Pitts-
burgh is its people, their ideals, their
hopes, their aims and their ambitions.”

Until we can learn to recognize the
value of those things which make up
the real Pittsburgh, we cannot judge
what is the meaning of our city, was
the conclusion at which the Chancel-
lor arrived in his address. .

Pastor C. Marshall Muir, of the
Belleﬁeld Presbyterian Church, de-
livered the invocation for this fitjst of
the freshman meetings. 

Following Dr. Bowman's address,
students were _sc__heduled to, meet the
deans of their respective "schools in
smaller assemblies. Dr. Stanton C.
Crawford, newly-appointed dean of the
College, met those entering his school
in the main auditorium of Memorial
Hall. In another room of the hall Dr.
Charles E. Prall, dean of the School
of Education, conferred with members

of the pre-Education group. Dr. Charles _

S. Tippetts, dean of the School of Bus-
uess Administration, presided over a
meeting of freshmen entering that
school in the banquet room of Memorial
Hall, while Dr. E. A. Holbrook, dean
of" the School of Engineering and
Mines, met newcomers to those schools
at Thaw Hall.

This afternoon’s program will be de-
voted to an athletic assembly for
freshman men in Memorial hall. W.
Don Harrison, director of athletics, is
to preside over the meeting and will
introduce to the new students the var-
sity coaches of the various University
athletic teams.

A conference of student health is
scheduled for tomorrow morning, when
Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Student Health Service, and Dr. W.
T. Root, new dean of the Graduate
School, will address the freshman
men.

Tomorrow afternoon the men will
meet in a conference hour with Dr.
Lanfear. Following Dr. Lanfear’s re-
marks, in which he will explain the
functions of his office in regard to
men students of the University, the
group will adjourn to conference rooms
to meet with the various student coun-
selors. These upperclassmen W111 meet
with their designated small groups
and explain informally the purposes
of fraternities and the system‘UaE'cam-
pus activities. Fraternity ’hand'p_ooks

A Long View
TODAY THE CLASS of 1939 is ofﬁcially born.

Today that class is but a name, a mass of clay

without shape or fashion. Coming from all
points of the compass, coming with all sorts of
preconceived ideas, you of that class are brought
together for the first time. There is only one dis-
tinction which is alike to all of you: you are called
freshmen.

But it shall not always be like that. Three years
from now, some of you——not all of you—will be
beginning your ﬁnal year in college. It is far be-
yond the realm of possibility that the group which
sat in Memorial Hall auditorium this morning will
return intact to start its senior year. But those of
you who shall reassemble then will have come a
long way from what you are today.

You will have learned that the “rah” and the

“razz” are at the University as outmoded as a tin-
type photograph. You will have learned that col-
lege students do go to classes, that they study on
many occasions other than the night immediately
preceding the ﬁnal exam, and that tastes in college
clothes do not run entirely to baggy pants, plus-
fours, and impossible hats.

Some of you will, three years from now, be won-
dering how you can assist members of another
freshman class—the one of 1942-——in getting ac-
quainted with Pitt. You’ll wonder how to tell
them about Pitt spirit, how to point out the advan-
tages of participating in activities, how to insist
that they make more than a half-hearted attempt
to know their professors and to cultivate friend-
ships among classmates.

More than likely you will tind—some of you—-
that there has been added unto you a. Pitt spirit.
Not pretentious or gaudy or superﬁcial, it will be
a spirit that is sincere, deep-rooted, and lasting.
You may have felt the virus coming into your sys-
tem; again, it may have stolen upon you without
your noticing it. For some of you the spirit will
be there, and with it you will realize that the
values of your life at this University have been in-
creased a hundred-fold.

Today, tomorrow, and Friday the class of 1939
will get the preliminary injections of Pitt spirit.
The doses will be good, and they will be carefully
administered by those who know and appreciate
the values .of Pitt spirit, of that we have little
doubt. What the effect of those doses will be upon
the freshmen of today, no one is able to tell. We
shall not know the answer next week, we can only
guess at its outcome next year.

But three years from now there can be made a
reckoning. It should not be too hard to look then
at those of you who are still fortunate enough to
be here and determine if the symptoms of Pitt
spirit have grown and prospered within you. It is
the hope of all those who assist in carrying out this
Freshman Viieek program that the several seeds
they can sow in these few days will, in the coming
years, reap a. bountiful harvest of Pitt spirit for
all of you—not just some of you.

famous Charlie Hyatt, University bas-
ketball star. If Mannie proves as
good on the basketball court as did
big brother Charlie, it is unlikely that
Dr. Carlson will suffer any regrets.

Leonard Levison and Robert Korn-
hauser, alumni of Taylor Allderdice
High School, prepared for their start
in the University by acting as coun-
selors at a boys’ camp near Ellwood
City this summer.

John Vvoodruff, former Connellsville

scholastic mile champion, shouldn’t
do the freshman track team any harm
next spring.

James Stark, Braddock High alum-
nus, is a ﬁrst honor graduate and re-

The following are some ﬁrst-day-
at-the—Universit.v impressions collect-
ed at random:

Henry L. Wilson, Mt. Washiiigton.
“I want to take this opportunity to
comment on the courtesy extended by
the registration officials. They seem
to be genuinely interested in the stu-
dents’ welfare.

 

Mary L. Lewis, Pittsburgh. “I
think it's all perfectly swell and nice
and all that. I’m very thrilled. I’m
also frightened to death about every-
thing. Hate being a freshman again.

1 remember how all alone I felt four
years ago at Peabody.”

Sam P. Ralston, Pittsburgh. ‘‘I like
being a student at the University
very much. It’s all work for me and
no play. l’ve had all my fun during
my high school days.”

Betty Jane Smith, Pittsburgh. “It’s
a lot better than I expected. I’ve been
treated swell during my registration
troubles. I think the Cathedral is the
grandest building.”

 

Herbert R. Rosenthal, Pittsburgh.
“l’ve always wanted to come to the
University, ever since I was a fresh-
man in high school, and I’m very anx-
ious to get started.”

Jane E. Gardner, Pittsburgh, “I’ve
spent the past summer in the Univer-
sity zoology department and have
formed a deep liking for the Univer-
sity.”

Panther Gridders Prepare
For Final lntra-Squad Game

Sophomores Stand Out In
Baxter, LaRue Only T

‘Nith only three days remain

Training Camp Workou s;
wo Regulars Returning

ing before the “big clash” of the

training season on Saturday, Coach “Jock” Sutherland is expected
to put the ﬁnishing touches on the maneuvers of his 1935 football
squad at Camp Hamilton, \Vindber, Pa.

Faced with the task of re-b

uilding virtually an entirely new

eleven for this fall due to the loss of nine ﬁrst-stringers from his 1934
team, Coach Sutherland has been devoting a great deal of time to his

sophomore material. 9

While no starting lineup has been
deﬁnitely selected at this early dat.e,
it appears that four sophomores stand
ﬁne chances of being in the starting
lineup when the Panthers open their
arduous 10'-game schedule against
Waynesburg on Saturday, Septem-
ber 28.

To replace the great gal) at full-
back caused by the graduation of
Weinstock and VVeisenbaugh_ the
fullback twins, a husky ﬁrst-year
man, Frank Patrick, is being groomed
for the job. Patrick has shown a
great deal of promise in the camp
workouts and is fairly certain of see-
ing lots of service this fall. He is
also quite adept at placement kick-
ing. Two veterans are giving the
East Chicago youngster plenty of
competition for this key post. Len
Rector who has been holding down
a third-string berth for the past two
years has a good opportunity of mak-
ing the third year a charm by getting
the job. Bob McClure, a former
quarterback, is also a hot candidate
for the post.

Dante Dalle-Tezze. former Jean-
nette high ﬂash, and. Luther Rich-
ards, both sophomores, have been al-

ternating at the left guard post and

either one may get the starting as-
signment. B-ill_ Glassford, the only
holdover from last season's quartet
of guards, seems to have the inside
track for the other guard position.
Other prospects for guard jobs are
Jimmy Scarfpin_ Leon Vvohlgemuth,
Marwood Stark, Earl McCue, Sam
Uram, Al Vvalton, and George Yocos.
At one of the tackle positions, an-
other sophomore, George Delich,
looms as a regular. Delich was shift-
ed from guard to a tackle during the
spring session and has been paired
with Averell Daniell at the tackle
posts in the camp drills. Delich will
be pressed by Art Detzel, veteran let-
terman, who was a late arrival at
camp. Tony Matisi, 200-pound tackle,
is another sophomore possibility for
this line post. Gene Stoughton and
Pete Avizienis, two reserves, round
out the list of tackle candidates.
Sutherland lost Harvey Rooker, a
star end, from the 1934 eleven but
may ﬁnd a. capable replacement in
l"ra.nk Souchak, a very promising

At the other end of the
line, Verne Baxter, one of the two
1934 ﬁrst-stringers, will hold forth,
Two lettermen, Eddie Quarantillo
and Vincent Sites, are also making
spirited bids for starting jobs.

The center post will be occupied
most of the time by Nick Klisky who
alternated with George Shotwell for
the past two seasons. Replacements
for Klisky will come from Don «Hens-
ley and Henry Adams, two sophomore
players.

Arnold Greene. big junior from
Huntingdon, is the outstanding con-
tender to ﬁll the quarterback’s shoes.
Greene saw quite a bit of service last
year at the signal-barking post and
will probably get ﬁrst call. His chief
rival is Johnnny Michelosen, a soph-
omore from Ambridge.

Ha.lfbacks are plentiful around the
camp.
stringer returning for action, will
probably be found at right half
again. Leon Shedlosky, another vet-
eran, is back and may edge out La-
Rue for the starting post. At left
halfback. Coach Sutherland can call
upon Hub Randour, who understudied
Mike Nicksick last season. He will
have plenty of opposition from Bill
Stapulis, a sophomore, who has shown
up well in the practice sessions.

Other backs to be reckoned with
are Johnny Vvood, IL-eo Malarkey, Joe
Trogleone, and Johnny Urban. VVood
is the best punter on the squad.

Saturday’s game will bring to a
close the two-weeks’ training period
at camp. In the last Saturday’s clash
the varsity defeated the reserves by
a 14-0 count with LaRue and Patrick
standing out for the varsity. After
breaking camp. the squad will return
to Pittsburgh for the ﬁnal week of re-
hearsals prior to the opening clash
with Waynesburg.

After that game, the Panthers will
be kept plenty busy priming for each
of their nine other opponents, First.

Green armbands, the initial step in
a freshman woman's introduction to
the customs and traditions of Pitt

women, will be donned by freshman
women tomorrow afternoon at an as-
sembly sponsored by the customs com-
mittee of VVSGA.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of wo-
men_ will welcome the class of 1939
and following the distribution of arm-
bands, the newly formed class will
meet the senior mentors, who will
guide the women during their early
weeks on the University campus.

At 4:30 o’clock, the mentor groups,
following separate meetings, will
gather on the lawn of the Hotel Schen-
ley for the traditional Freshman High
Tea. This is the ﬁrst time that the
event has been held out of doors, and
weather permitting, the program will
be given from the orchestra platform
on the lawn. The tea is sponsored by
the University through the ofﬁces of
the dean of women.

Miss Amos. dean of women. and
Miss Helen Rush and Miss Isabelle
Anderson, assistants to the dean of
women, will be hostesses,’ assisted by
members of Cwens, sophomore honor-
ary organization.

committee chairman, will explain
“The meaning of customs to Pitt wo-
men,” and Irene Maroney will read
and interpret customs regulations.
Ruth Rosenthal will tell of her re-
actions to the customs regulations as
a freshman. Miss Maroney and Miss
Rosenthal are secretary and treasurer
of the committee.

A dialogue between a Pitt freshman
and a “wise old woman,” portrayed by
Sally Digby and Lucy Conn, will pre-
cede the historial sketch presented
by Cwens at the tea. Adele Rome will
portray Lucy Stone, the ﬁrst women’s
suffragette, Betty Scott will take the
part of Myra Bradwell, a lawyer, and
Verna Douglas will assume the role
of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell. Ethel
Shrom will play the part of Mary
Lyon, founder of Mt. Holyoke College,
and Ruth Rosenthal will interpret the
part of Velva Lockwood, the ﬁrst wo-
man who ran for President of the
United States.

Customs enforcement will begin at
8:30 o’clock on Monday morning.’ The
green armband must be worn on cam-
pus at all times until the customs
test, scheduled for the second week
of school, has been successfully
passed. Following that, the regulation
blue and gold armband will be worn
until the end of customs enforcement
on November 1.
