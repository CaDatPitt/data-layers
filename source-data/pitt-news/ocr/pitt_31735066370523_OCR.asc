UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Dan Bates
News Editor

The university has not yet made
a decision concerning an alleged
hazing incident involving the Alpha
Kappa Alpha sorority, according to
Student Activities Director Andrew
Smith after a lengthy hearing last
night.

During the hearing which lasted
two and a half hours, at least eight
people testified on behalf of the
sorority in an effort to convince the
university to dismiss the hazing
charges. The complaintant and her
mother were also present at the
hearing.

Freshman Fonda Duse, an Alpha
Kappa Alpha pledge, reported the
alleged hazing to Smith last Thurs-
day after allegedly reinjuring her
« knee during an activity which she
said “could have been avoided.”
She said she originally injured her
knee in an accident while in high
school.

This past Monday, Smith inform-
ed the sorority of the hazing
charges and then suspended all
Alpha Kappa Alpha activities and
pledge functions pending the out-
come of the hearing.

Although no sorority members
present at the hearing would com-
ment about the charges, several
members said they were conﬁdent
that everything will work out
favorably. '

After the hearing, neither the
sorority members nor Duse would
comment on the hearing, but Duse
said she does not want the sorority
to lose its charter as a result of the

Pitt’s chapter of Alpha Kappa
Alpha was founded in 1918. The
national chapter was founded in
1908 at Howard University in
Washington, D.C., and according
to sorority members at Pitt, it is the

Pitt faculty to vote on union

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

If the United Faculty has its way, the
teachers at the University of Pittsburgh

‘ will, sooner or later, have a union. The

United Faculty, a professional union
organization, has been working to
unionize the Pittsburgh campusfacul-
ty since the 1970s.

The United Faculty intends to hold
a campus-wide election in which the
faculty would vote on whether or not
they want union representation. But so
far the Posvar administration has op-
posed the election, even though Mayor
Caliguiri has asked the university ad-
ministration for an election.

The Pitt administration contends that
faculty are part of management and

BAS scorns Duquesne

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s Black
Action Society stands by Duquesne stu-
dent Jeff Gray, who filed charges of
harassment against John Gnipp and two
other members of Duquesne’s Kappa
Sigma Phi fraternity.

In the March 6 issue of The Du-
quesne Duke, Gray said that he ﬁled
charges with the Judicial Board against
the members because they painted
obscene comments on his door. He also
cited various incidents of harassment
which he said have been taking place
during the entire year.

According to The Duquesne Duke,
Gray said that ketchup was splattered
into his room under the door. He said
that when he placed newspapers on the
bottom of his door to prevent the inci-
dent from recurring, the papers were

therefore cannot form a union.
United Faculty President Philip
Wion thinks that the administration’s
ban on the election is unjust. “Their
position isn’t only anti-union, it’s anti-
democratic,” said Wion. “They aren’t
willing to allow the faculty the demo-
cratic right to decide for themselves
[on] whether or not they want to be
organized or bargain collectively.”
The United Faculty has taken the
election question to the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board. The board can
grant an election if the United Faculty
collects 30 percent of faculty signatures
in favor of an election. According to
Wion, the PLRB told them that they
had to have at least 30 percent on the
2,240 possible signatures. The board,
said Wion, suggested in fall 1985 that
2,240 faculty members were eligible to
vote. The medical school is not in-

lit on fire. He also said that racist signs
were hung on his door. Gray attributes
these incidents to members of the
fraternity.

The only fraternity member available
for comment, Jerome Keiger, said he
knew nothing of the incidents.

Michelle Bell, a member of Pitt’s
BAS, read about the incident in The
Duquesne Duke and decided that
something needed to be done.

“It didn’t seem like anyone was
helping Jeff,” said Bell. “We [BAS]
started a petition. We got about 300
names on it representing the black stu-
dent body of Pitt. We sent a copy to
Duquesne’s Black Student Union and
also to State Representative K. Leroy
Irvis. I ‘

“We are representing that Grupp be
banned from the university campus as
was the case when the Duquesne
basketball players were accused of rap-

cluded in the count because it has its
own bargaining unit.

In December 1985, the United
Faculty presented the PLRB with ap-
proximately 780 faculty signatures,
which the union organization thought
was at least 30 percent of the eligible
faculty.

But on Jan. 13, the PLRB’s examiner
issued a proposal that the United Facul-
ty’s petition for an election be dis-
missedbecause it did not include the
necessary number of signatures. The
United Faculty is now appealing that
dismissal proposal and is demanding a
recount of the signatures. “It was and
is our belief that we did have well over
30 percent,” commented Wion.

Wion also is asking the PLRB to
release its list of faculty which is con-
sidered eligible to vote so that the

ing a white female,” continued Bell.
“It’s because it’s a role reversal -
whites picking on blacks — that nothing
is getting done.” .

Bell said tlmt if the results of the
hearing were not satisfactory, further
steps would be taken.

According to The Duquesne Duke,
Gray was upset because he couldn’t get
help from anyone. He said that when
he informed his resident assistant of
various occurences, nothing was done.
Gray said a police report also was ﬁled.

On March 17, Gray presented his
case in front of Duquesne’s Judicial
Board.

Gray told Susanne Kimberland, a
writer for The Duquesne Duke, that
John Grupp was expelled from the dor-
mitory and that the charges against the
other two fraternity members did not
follow through.

Beginning with the 1987-88 aca-
demic year, Pitt students may have a
one-week spring break and an extra
day of Thanksgiving vacation.

Also, summer classes may end in
late July, rather than rnid—August as
they do now. .

These changes, the current proposal
of the Academic Calendar Review
Committee, are being reviewed exten-
sively throughout the entire universi-
ty, according to Dr. John R. Quat-
roche, university secretary and com-
mittee chairman.

Provost Roger Benjamin appointed
the 18-member ad—hoc committee last
spring to examine in detail the present
university calendar.

Quatroche said that any calendar
changes would be put off until 1987
because Pitt is now in the fourth year
of a five-year academic calendar,
which has already set the beginning and
end dates of the 1986-87 academic
year.

Although the committee did for-
mulate a set of revisions for the calen-
dar, Quatroche stressed “our role is

' strictly advisory to the provost and the

university. ’ ’ e

The proposed calendar will be re-
viewed by the senate’s educational
policies committee, the university’s
academic deans and other senior ad-
ministrators before a decision is
announced.

“During the calendar review, the
basic charge the committee was con-

cerned with was: Is the university,

Bicentennial

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Pitt’s 200th birthday is approaching,
and plans for the bicentennial celebra-
tion are under way. Although many

events, particularly student-sponsored

events, are still in the planning stages,
Pitt’s Bicentennial Commission has
released a sketch of the events that have
been already approved for the fall and
winter terms.

0 October ’86 — The festivities of
the bicentennial year will begin during
Homecoming Week. Exhibits cele-
brating Pitt’s campus of the past and
the future will be opened.

The presidents of the top 56 research
universities in the country will meet at
Pitt Oct. 19-21 in a session of the
Association of American Universities.
Pitt became a member of this organiza-
tion in 1974.

Throughout the rest of Homecoming
Week the university will hold walking
tours of the campus, giving an oppor-
tunity for parents of students and res-
idents of Pittsburgh to get a first—hand
look at what’s happening at Pitt.

The ﬁrst symposium of the bicenten-
nial year will be held in October; it
will explore advances in cancer therapy
with biologicals.

A parade will be held_in Oakland

meeting its current academic needs
relative to those of the students?”
Quatroche said.

The committee examined the current
15-week trimester calendar, which in-
cludes the fall, winter and spring terms.
A According to Dr. Irwin Schulman,
CAS dean and calendar review com-
mittee member, the present winter
term is too compressed. “There is very
little time off for everyone. I tremen-
dously support the addition of a spring
break. It can be very depressing for stu-
dents during mid—winter and they need
the time of .”

The possibility of a spring break dur-
ing winter term is the most significant
calendar revision. To permit the week-
long break, as proposed, the under-
graduate reading days would be moved

to the weekend and the term may be i

extended by one week. The winter term
probably would then end the last week
of April.

Although the term may be slightly
longer, the extra time would beneﬁt the
students, according to Schulman. “Stu-

'dents need a period in which they do
not have to work -— a time to relax.”

Quatroche said that moving the read-
ing days to the weekends isn’t a signifi-
cant loss. It may even enforce the
reading days since ﬁnal exams cannot
be scheduled those days.

Quatroche added that ending the term
a week later isn’t that much of a change
because Pitt students will still be out

of school before any other college in

the area.

However, regarding the break, Quat-
roche stressed the importance of pari-
ty of instructional meetings. In other

followed by a fireworks display and a

game between Pitt and Navy, there will
be a bicentennial half—time show un-
veiling Pitt’s new band uniforms and
instruments.

At the end of October, a tribute to
Pitt’s Nationality Rooms will be
featured.

0 November/December —— A bicen-
tennial jazz concert will be held at
Heinz Hall on Nov. 1, and events are
planned that will culminate with a
display for the holidays throughout
December in and around the Cathedral
of Leaming and the William Pitt Union.

0 January — Two Smithsonian ex-
hibits will be displayed at Pitt this
month including “Photographs of
Matthew Brady,” and “Everyday Life
in America after the Revolution.”

at Carnegie Music Hall featuring the
Juilliard String Quartet will kick off the
bicentennial festivities for this month.

The Honors College may also be
opened in February, pending action by
the university. The school year’s’ sec-
ond symposium will be held, bringing
scholars from around the world to
discuss the United States Constitution.

The Constitution also turns 200 years ,

old next year.

WASHINGTON — The House of
Representatives has rejected President
Reagan’s request for $100 million in
aid to the Contra rebels fighting the
leftist government of Nicaragua. The
vote was 222-210. House Speaker Tip
O’Neill had predicted that the vote
would be “very, very close,” and
sources on Capitol Hill had said ﬁve
votes in either direction could swing the
tally. Yesterday, President Reagan
telephoned House members who were
considered to be in the “undecided”
column in a last-minute push for sup-
port. The focus of the battle for Con-
tra aid now will shift to the Senate
where the issue is also up for
consideration.

Marcos had planned
presidential funding

Philippines ~— Documents seized
from deposed Philippine President
Marcos showed he had a plan to fun-
nel tens of thousands of dollars to the
1980 campaigns of Ronald Reagan and
Jimmy Carter.

Reagan, Carter and three other can-
didates named in the documents said
they did not know about the planned
contributions until this week. The
planned contributions surfaced in one
of 23,000 documents being examined
by a House Foreign Affairs sub-
committee.

No one from the Judicial Board could
be reached.

Gray said he ﬁled charges on Feb.
19 after he received no response to a
letter he wrote to Dennis Golden, vice
president of Student Affairs. Gray told
Kimberland that in the letter he cited
some of the incidents which happened
to him throughout the year.

Golden said the issue was adjucated
Monday at the Judicial Board meeting.

“The steps that we took with Jeff and

others were the proper steps to be
taken,” said Golden. “Now, the issue
has come to a resolve.”

Bell said she feels it is very impor-
tant for students to be aware of what
is going on in other universities. “We
as black students should be aware and
concerned about our brothers and
sisters,” said Bell. “This racist socie-
ty is always trying to oppress black
people. In order to survive, we must
united and become one collective

, body.”

House of Representatives rejects Contra aid

The name of the Mabuhay Corp. of
California appeared at the head of the
document. The document said Marcos’
associates planned to give $50,000 each
to the 1980 Reagan and Carter cam-
paigns, and $10,000 to Senator Alan
Cranston’s senatorial campaign. Cam-
paign contributions from foreigners are
illegal.

Cranston, a California Democrat.
said he unknowingly received $1,000
from Mabuhay. White House Spokes-
man Larry Speakes said the 1980
Republican ca. aign had “adequate
safeguards” to sc.;en illegal contribu-
tions but that campaign aides were
checking records to see if contributions
were received from the Philippines. A
spokesman for Carter said the former
president was not aware of any con-
tributions connected to Marcos.

Dole wants a
bipartisan budget

WASHINGTON — Senate GOP
Leader Robert Dole hinted he wants to
negotiate with the White House before
a bipartisan budget "plan goes to the
Senate ﬂoor. The plan, OK’d by the
Senate Budget Committee, goes con-
trary to the one offered by President
Reagan. Despite cutting military spend-
ing and adding an increase in taxes,
Panel Chairman Pete Domenici said he

is confident the bipartisan budget could
gain a Senate OK. Dole said he wants
to get an idea of how many senators
will support the budget package before
taking it to the floor.

Personal income
grew last month

WASHINGTON — The government
said personal income grew at an annual
rate of 0.6 percent in February follow-
ing a revised 0.1 percent increase in
January. The Commerce Department
said income increased $19.2 billion in
February to a seasonally adjusted an-
nual rate of $3.406 trillion. The
February increase is the largest since
December of last year, when the index
rose by 1.1 percent. It is the ninth con-
secutive monthly increase.

the key groups involved in the educa-
tional process here at Pitt. Alumni,
members of the university administra-
tion, students and their families gath-
ered to recognize the achievements of
students in the university’s different
schools.

Presenting the student‘ leaders with
their awards was Grace Harris, Esq.,
the president of the General Alumni
Association, who pointed out that the
award was not directly linked to grade
point average. Instead, she said, the
award honors students “for personal
contributions which have enriched the

Susan Block, one of the honorees for
the School of Engineering, was pleased
that she had been able to contribute
something to the university. ’ ’ A lot of

eall you to help with a program, to give
ideas for some new project at school
or just when they need a helping
hand,” said Block. “I enjoy helping;
it gives me a chance to learn and a
chance to meet new people. As much
as I’ve done for the school, I feel
they’ve done twice as much for me. ”

Karen S. Fisher, from the School of
Pharmacy, was honored by her school
and was also the student speaker.
Fisher noted that leadership involves
“doing” instead of talking.

She told the storv of the School of
Pharmacy’s uphill battle with the ad-
ministration when it made public its
plan to phase the program out. “Peo-

ple can do a lot when they work hard,
and they work together,” said Fisher.

Featured alumnus speaker Franklyn
E. Conﬂenti, Esq. told students that he
would never forget what the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh had done for him and
asked that they too remember Pitt in the
future. “I want to ask you young peo-
ple here tonight to give this university
a part of your spare time after you
graduate.”

According to Conﬂenti, that would

give an already great univeristy a
chance to become even better.

That thought was shared by Block.

“The dinner encouraged me to come .

back and help any way I can,” said
Block. As for the award itself, Block
said she was honored to be recognized
with distinguished students from the
other schools. “It’s nice to know that
the alumni and the administrators are
aware of what the students give to the
school. It was a great honor for me.”

Last Gasp For
Downtown Merchants

Slouching proﬁt margins and outright capital
losses have been a particularly vexatious pro-
blem for downtown merchants of late,
resulting in more than one retail failure. But
take heart, all you distraught entrepreneurs,
there’s hope yet. Beginning April 28, for a
trial period of undetermined length, downtown
merchants have been given the go—ahead to
keep their shop doors open weekdays until 7
p.m. This is to rejuvenate the downtown retail
trade.

Will this hopeful undertaking conspire to
keep the afﬂuent young bastions of capitalism
in town after work to exercise their God-given
right to extravagance? Or will the lure of
suburban complacency yet draw these weary
working boys and girls homeward to delight
in such pleasures as central air conditioning,
the family VCR and Haagen Daz ice cream?
Undeniably, there is a certain sense of despera-
tion in this attempt to save the city merchants

,from ruin. ,

In spite of all efforts, downtown merchants
might soon be strong—armed into grappling
with unpleasant truth. These days, middle-
class consumer tastes incline toward the sterili-
ty of malls and such. The merchants of
downtown Pittsburgh might soon find
themselves catagorized as yet another relic of
a bygone day. Forthenn ﬁns uend nnght
signify financial paroxysm; for the subur-
banite, it amounts to merely another curious

demographic statistic.

The Ritual Dissent/Jam

es M./S Crary

A am And The Sleaze Review

He ﬂexes big adjectives to blow off
steam: Who do I mean? It rhymes with
rat —— you guessed it: It’s Eisenstat. Not
only is he the devil, but he's God’s gift
to the bully pulpit. While respectable
people drool and chant their approval
of war, Adam pinpoints precisely the
reprehensible psychological mech-
anisms submerged beneath the bulging
blasphemy of ardent anti-porn
crusaders and_ consumers of mental
diarrhea like “First Blood,” “Rambo”
and Ronnie the Gypper. To like Adam
Eisenstat one must maintain the most
sordid form of self-respect but not be
a vile toady to the perverse ingratitude

of polite society. If it weren’t for dorks
like Kevin Bold, someone might actual-
ly read Eisenstat, which, of course.
would be going too far.

The only point on which I take ex-
ception with Eisenstat is the issue of ab-
surdism. Absurdism, to me, particular-
ly stodgy, intellectual puke that I am,
is as close to nihilism as a living per-
son can approach. For example: One
afternoon while wandering Oakland in
a stupor induced by a pathetically
uninteresting homework assignment, I
found a crewcut mob ﬂanking a
drunken ﬁend who was raving, “You

all should be shot/you wouldn’ta got-
ten away.  He was a sick, old
fascist, someone said.

"Were you really a Nazi?" I asked,
tickled pinko with disgust.

“National Socialist, National
Socialist, you don’t even know what
that means," he raved.

Suddenly I was Dorothy, uttering
sweetly, “If you please , Sir, what are
munchkins? ’ ’

His reply: “If you don’t know what
you’re talking about, don’t ask ques-
tions."

I knew instantly that I was face to
face with a moral inversion. A des-
picable, reprehensible example of the
grossest aspects of the HERD. Blind
obedience, a phenomenon widely ad-
mired in government circles, is the
quintessence, the epitome, the oozing
orb which masterminds the consensus.
It is also absurdity in its starkest,
abysmal absolute.

Which brings us to sleaze. Someone
tells me “Pink Flamingos" was the
cinematic manifesto of sleaze. I
disagree, revolting picture that it must
be. Sleaze, to me, are the people in-

Washin ton Post Writers Gr0up/ Richard Cohen
Less Than Candid, More Than Harmless

Letters to the editor have blasted
him. Editorials have denounced him.
Members of Congress have called for
his resignation and George McGovern,
indignant and eloquent, says he has
“crossed a line.” I am talking of
Patrick Buchanan, about whom, I pro-
mise, you should care not one whit. He
punches the clock like you and me.

We are excused for not knowing that
because Buchanan is being treated as
if he were his own man — a loose can-
non at the White House. Only a year
ago, however, the papers were full of
stories about how Buchanan was being
ignored and, indicative of political im-
potence, given a windowless ofﬁce. He
himself admitted that his inﬂuence was
limited. He had wanted to put Jonas
Savimbi in the hero’s chair at the State
of the Union message but had, alas,
been overruled. The world lost yet

. another hero and I another column.

What was really lost was perspec-
tive. It was, of course, Buchanan who
penned that now infamous op-ed piece

for The Washington Post. In it, he
enunciated the Buchanan Doctrine
which holds that you either favor the
president’s mindless Nicaragua policy
or you are, sorry if the shoe ﬁts, a com-
mie symp: “With the vote on contra
aid the Democratic Party will reveal
whether it stands with Ronald Reagan
and the resistance — or Daniel Ortega
and the communists." The choice is
yours.
But there is another choice. And that
is to recognize that Buchanan is the
president’s man. On this issue he has
been told, or allowed, to redbait. What
this says about the vaunted character
of Ronald Reagan I leave to you. But
it says plenty about the president’s
popularity and his amazing ability to
be held harmless for what he does. Not
only do‘ his critics pretend that Bu-
chanan is an independent operator but,
in a telltale salute to Reagan’s stand-
ing, they call upon him to resign.
Perish the thought that they should de-
mand that Reagan ﬁre Buchanan; that

would be holding the president respon-
sible for being president.

But the president is the president.
When it comes to Nicaragua, he has
chosen a certain course and wants a
certain outcome: the elimination of the
Sandinista regime. The means to that
end entails a liberal amount of 100-
mule-team snake oil. A contra aid pro-
gram that once was (1) supposed to get
the Cubans out of Nicaragua and then
(2) to interdict the ﬂow of arms to El
Salvador is now (3) designed to prod
the Sandinistas to the bargaining table
so that they can (4) be persuaded to
leave ofﬁce. The fact is that (5) the
elimination of the communist regime
has been the goal all along, and the
president (6) has been less than candid.

Reagan’s intentions should come as
no surprise. He is a fervent anti-
communist and always has been. When
it comes to the Sandinistas, his ideology
holds they cannot be trusted, they will
always lie, they will seek to spread
their revolution, they will enter into

military agreements with the Soviet

outpost of the U.S.S.R. For these red
pests only the Orkin man will sufﬁce.

In the context of American politics,
that is not an unorthodox view, and
maybe there is something to it. But the
president plays cute about what he
wants. Other presidents — Richard
Nixon, Lyndon Johnson — took hell
for their lack of “candor.” Not so
Reagan. He gets to hide his intentions
under a bushel of terms that would
make a Soviet propagandist blush —
freedom ﬁghter, for one — and every-
one sings hosannas to his openness and
honesty. Reagan’s ultimate achieve-
ment as a politician is to be seen as

vesting in military industries who _will

speak any lie, about any person, in

order to justify acts of aggression.

Sleaze, to me, is any ﬁend, in any

uniform, of any ﬂag who will be will-

ing to kill civilians in order to pander
to some black-and-white brand of ide-
ology. Sleaze is, in short, not the act
of a transvestite kissing an iguana but
the shooting of nuns by men being paid
by the Congress of the United States,
the murder of Afghans and the con-
sumption of televised lies about the
need for an inﬂated Department of
Defense.

Sleaze is. in short. absurd.

Now the call is for Buchanan to fall
on his sword for redbaiting. But
Buchanan is that Washington oddity:
the honest man, burning with ideolog-
ical zeal, who wants to leave the world
better for being in it. He gave up

. $400,000 a year jiving and jabbing on
television, writing columns and doing
speeches (no windows, though) for the
$75,100 a year of a presidential assis-
tant. He did that because he knows that
Ronald Reagan is his kind of president,
that the two of them hold identical
views on Nicaragua, communism and
what history will say about Democrats
who, in their view, choose wrong.
The old lament of conservatives is to
let Reagan be Reagan. No need for
that. Pat Buchanan already is.

Georgetown prof speaks on Mid

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

According to Dr. Robert Neumann,
any Mideast peace negotiations must
include Israel, Jordan and, most im-
portantly, the Palestine Liberation
Organization if they are to be suc-
cessful.

The Georgetown International Af-
fairs specialist told the Colloquium on
Security Tuesday night, “Jordan.can-
not come forward without Palestinian
participation in all phases of negotia-

tions.  An Israeli deal with only Jor-
dan would be virtually valueless.”

A number of factors have been
responsible for the PLO’s long absence
from the diplomatic mainstream,
Neumann believes, some of which per-
tain to U.S. actions.

“The Palestinians want to be
recognized as having co-equal status
with Jordan,” he said. “The United
States has not until very recently [last
Feb. 10] recognized them as having
such a position."

Israel, Neumann said, also has con-
tributed to Palestinian exclusion from
the peace table. For decades, he said,
the Israelis have refused to consider
“territorial revision,” insisting
beforehand that discussion pertaining
to the Israeli-occupied West Bank be
barred from negotiations. He contends
the PLO has found such a stringent
precondition unacceptable. The West
Bank is overwhelmingly inhabited by
Palestinians and was taken by Israel
during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

Further offending the PLO,
Neumann said, have been Israeli efforts
to discredit the organization as the
legitimate representative of the Pales-
tinian people.

“The Israelis,” he said, “have tried
to create an alternative leadership to the
PLO  they must realize there is no
substitution for the organization.”

According to Neumann, the PLO
also has behaved quite stubbornly.
Palestinian leaders, he alleged, have
flatly refused to consider extending de
facto recognition to Israel, claiming
such a move would split, and thus
weaken, their organization.

Neumann said any Mideast negotia-
tions which do materialize would be
likely to occur in threerather distinct
stages: a political phase, a diplomatic
phase and a reconciliation phase.

“We are still in the very first phase

—— the political phase,” he remarked.’ -

"The question is not yet how to
negotiate but how to bring about the
negotiations. "

Although a self-proclaimed pessi-
mist, Neuman admits at least some pro-
gress has been made in the Mideast. He
noted, for example, that the “existence
of Israel is no longer seriously in
doubt.”

Calendar

continued from page 1
words, the university requires that each
course meet at least 13 times per term.
“Parity of class meetings must be
observed,” he said.

Another guideline for devising the
calendar was that a total of six days
must be reserved at the end of each
term for ﬁnal examinations.

One‘ concern the review committee
had regarding the extension of winter
term was whether or notgthe students
would still be able to secure summer
employment.

This issue was addressed in a recent
campus survey by the Student Govern-
ment Board. “Of the students respond-
ing to the survey, most felt extending
the winter term would not hamper their
chances of securing summer employ-
ment,” Quatroche said. ‘

Another issue regarding changes to
the winter term calendar, however, is
causing more controversy. Quatroche
explained that the proposal calls for
the university offices to open one week
before winter term classes begin. Tra-
ditionally, all university offices are
closed during Christmas break.

Tentatively for 1987-88, the univer-
sity offices would open Monday, Jan.
4, 1988, and classes would begin the
following Monday, Jan. 11.

The extra week would allow time for
final review of fall term grades of pro-
bationary students and to more effi-

ciently carry out the orientation, advis-
ing and registration of newywinter term
students.

Regarding fall term 1987-88, under-
graduate reading days again would be
moved to the weekend before the be-
ginning of the‘6—day final examination
period to permit an extra day of
Thanksgiving vacation.

Thus, the Thanksgiving holiday
break would be observed from the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the
Sunday after.

Quatroche added that the extra day
off would benefit those students who
live a great distance from the univer-
sity, since it would permit them more
travel time and time at home.

According to Quatroche, the pro-
posal of a 10-week summer session was
met with serious opposition. “A new
and smaller review committee will be
appointed to re—examine the current
proposal,” he said.

The proposal calls for the elimina-
tion of the 15-week spring term, which
ends in mid-August and includes a
seven—week spring session and a seven-
week summer session. It would be
replaced by a 10-week summer session
ending in late July.

Quatroche estimates a final decision
for the fall and winter academic calen-
dar of 1987-88 will be announced in the
near future. But the 10-week sum-
mer session proposal needs further
discussion.

Faculty

continued from page 1

United Faculty can compare it to its
own list. “We asked that we be al-
lowed to see the list so that we can
check it against our list,” said Wion.
“We don’t know how many faculty
they are considering. Are visiting pro-
fessors on the list or aren’t they? We
don’t know what number we have to
have 30 percent of. We thought it was
2,240, but it could be as high as
3,000.” ‘

Wion said that in most other states
the union is automatically given a copy
of the faculty list. He said he
understood why the signatures would
be kept confidential —— to protect the
voters — but he did not understand why
the facultylists would have to be kept
from the union.

“The argument for keeping the
names conﬁdential should not apply to
the total lists the way it does to the in-
dividual cards,” said Wion. “We hope
the board will treat this differently from
those situations where it is an employer
who is trying to get information about
the count."

The United Faculty also would like
to know how many signatures the

‘ PLRB ruled to be invalid, Wion said.

Realizing that their appeal may not
be upheld, members of the United
Faculty have already started another
card drive. Mid-July is the earliest that
they can present their new signature
cards to the board.

According to Wion, the Posvar ad-
ministration is preparing itself for the
event that 30 percent of the faculty does
in fact favor an election. If this does
happen, Wion thinks that the ad-
ministration will bring up the “Yeshiva
University Decision” as grounds
against a faculty union.

“The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in
1980 that the faculty of Yeshiva
University in New York were not en-
titled to bargain because they were
managers,” explained Wion. ,

It was a controversial ruling, said
Wion, and he claims that it is not ap-
plicable at Pitt because Pitt is under the
state law and not the federal law (under
which the Supreme Court issue was
made).

“This whole Yeshiva issue needn’t
have been raised,” commented Wion.
“The only reason the administration is
raising it is to try to prevent the facul-
ty from having an election.”

Violent Femmes: Gospel Accordingto Gano

By Michael Fay

In Herman Hesse’s novel Demian
there is a scene, late at night, in which
a young man tells Emil Sinclair, the
protagonist, that he feels on the verge
of breakdown. Near weeping, he tells
Sinclair that he can no longer combat
his impure thoughts and feelings, and
he is afraid even to fall asleep. This is
teenage psycho/physical turmoil taken
to itsmost desperate extreme. Unable

to come to terms with his own com-
plexity, he feels tortured by the
unavoidable circumstances of his ex-
istence. This was a source of great
uneasiness for me when I first read it,
and the feeling echoed through me at
least one other time, four years ago,
when I heard the Violent Femmes’ first
record.

Gordon Gano was 15 when he wrote
most of the songs for Violent Femmes,
and unlike most teen artists, he

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

escaped cliche and trite simplification
in favor of startling, distorted images
and a strong, anxiety-laden voice. The
album, finally recorded and released
when he was 19, has become one of
those rare albums that continues to
sell at the same rate as when it was
first released. Mostly by word of
mouth, as Gano says, the album has
now sold upward of 400,000 copies.

All the while, the Femmes have con-
tinued to develop their folky acoustic
punk — or whatever it might be called
— and expand the boundaries of their
audience.

Ha//owed Ground, their second
recording, though equally dark and
twisted as their debut, seemed to open
up a lot of different avenues into the
world of adulthood. Along with the sex-
ual frustration, violent thoughts and
loneliness, there is a strengthening
undercurrent of family-oriented and
religious values.

Now, with The Blind Leading the
Naked, Gano, bass player Brian
Ritchie and drummer Victor De Loren-
zo have come of age as a band. Their
sound is fuller, their material is more
diverse, and faith seems to be winning

over. With their tour selling out and the
new album doing well, the Femmes
are at a commercial turning point. Are
they ready for the step up?

Sitting with me in a back row of
David Lawrence Auditorium, Gano
replies: “Every once in a while, we'll
get a letter from somebody which says,
‘I hope you never get popular.’ Not ‘I
hope you don’t change your music’ or
‘I hope you don’t sell out,’ but ‘I just
hope you don’t get too popular.” He
gives an exasperated smile. “Well, I

I Don’t See WhatAll The Gung Ho’s About

By Stan T. Wozniak

Look at all Gung Ho has going for it:
it was filmed partially in Pittsburgh and
many of the film's extras are Pitts-
burghers; it’s got director Ron Howard
(who was responsibile for the wonder-
ful Splash and last summer's Cocoon)
and it stars Pittsburgh's own Michael
Keaton (who has become a top-notch
funny man with films like Night Shift
and Johnny Dangerously). But that
doesn’t save Gung Ho from slipping
slowly into never-never land; in fact, it
also proves that when it rains, it pours.

The film is about a down-and-out
Pittsburgh nobody (Keaton) who
somehow gets the opportunity to fly to
Japan and invite a Japanese
automobile manufacturer to open a
factory in one of the city’s old, vacant
buildings. The move would bring more
revenue into the local economy and of-
fer unemployed workers another
chance to prosper without leaving the
area. Of course, the hero scores, and
suddenly we’re given a whole airplane
full of uptight Japanese thrown on
screen with a bunch of happy-go-lucky
Pittsburghers.

That alone had possibilities for some
genuinely funny antics, but Gung Ho
fails to deliver on so many levels that
even the more amusing moments are
buried beneath the rubble. First of all,
Gung Ho treats its Pittsburghers ter-
ribly; in short, it takes the city back to
the days of smoke and grime. There’s
not one shot of the Pittsburgh skyline
or of the majestic mountains (at least
F/ashdance gave people a European-
like view of the city’s bridges and
buildings). And the Pittsburghers in the
film basically are portrayed as loud-
mouthed, impatient beer-guzzlers.
Sure, there are unemployed people
around, but Gung Ho offers an unsym-
pathetic view for these people.
Therefore, we don’t really give a damn
about them, and as a result, the laughs
are empty and lifeless.

Another problem with Gung H0 is its
attitude toward the Japanese. They’re
looked at in a cold way; it’s a
stereotypical they-can’t-have-fun-
because-they-don’t-understandI sen-
sibility. The jokes could be very funny,
indeed, but we don’t feel like laughing
when we see the baby girl overfeeding
her Cabbage Patch doll and watching

l’

a video of Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not
Gonna Take lt” or when we see the
young boy rolling around the floor like
Rambo in his G.l. Joe outfit. When the
mother buys her son a bicycle and the
father won’t put it together because

he’s working, she sneers: “American
father would” and claims she bought
the bike at Sears because “That’s
where America shop.”

Page 9

 
   

Jokes like that could play well, if one
can abandon prejudice and simply en-
joy the sense of humor which sur-
rounds the American and Japanese
differences in culture. Gung Ho,
however, does not understand; the
humor is forced and compulsive. The
Japanese actors in the film are pretty
nondescript, though there is one ex-
ception. As the leader of the factory,
Gedde Watanabe is wonderful op-
posite Keaton. Even when the jokes
aren’t funny, his performance is
hyperactive and extemporaneous.

As Keaton's wife, Mimi Rogers is
very good, but George Wendt, as one
of Keaton’s buddies, is not the adept
comedian here that he usually is on
Cheers (Wendt, curiously, is also
wasted in another recent loser, House).
Michael Keaton — though this is not
going to go down in history as one of
his better films — is his usual amus-
ing self. He’s got a delicious sense of
phrasing that just makes him instantly
likable. Before the film was shown,
Keaton didn’t talk much about it (he did
say, “lt’s a funny movie,” so he lied
a little), and‘ I wondered why. But now
I know. ‘

A Crossroads Between Mozart and Muddy Waters

By Eric Glick

When a film like Crossroads comes
out, most of us are curious, the rest
uninterested. The film though is
definitely worth a look. The script is in-
telligent and sensitive, the casting is
good, the acting is understated and
subtle, and some of the shots are quite
nice, sometimes surreal, other times
picturesque. The film’s most striking
quality is the consistency of the per-
formers, who overall contribute a con-
sistency to the entire piece.

Ralph Macchio (star of The Karate

‘ Kid) stars as Eugene Martone, a

seventeen-year-old prodigy. He’s a
student at Juilliard, studying classical
guitar and has a burning desire to play
the blues. He’s torn between._Mozart
and Muddy Waters, to put it simply. His
obsession with this American folk tradi-

 tion leads him to a meeting with one

of the greatest Mississippi blues musi-
cians, Willie Brown (a.k.a, Blind Dog
Fulton), played with skill by Joe
Seneca. Then, the story takes off
when the two travel south to Mississip-
pi to find a lost song. The trials, joys,
miseries and hardships they encounter
make for a most engrossing story.
Macchio’s performance is splendid.
He plays Eugene with an understated
emotion-al level that is sustained
throughout the film. His gestures are
subtle, touching and significant. When
the girl that he and Willie meet along
their travels disappears to continue her
trek to Los Angeles, there is a very
touching and poignant moment when
Willie and Eugene (who Willy dubs
“Lightning Boy”) sit down to an early
morning drink. Eugene simply picks up
his guitar and begins to strum a stan-
dard blues progression. lt’s at this mo-
ment that this prodigy from Long Island
discovers that blues is more than just
a type of music; it's also that secret

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Keaton,

I think |’ve found your runaway son,

» Michael. You see, I was at this really
, neat premiere of the movie Gung H0

at Mirage the other night. Rumor has
it, somebody learned a lesson when
the premiere of Flight of the Spruce
Goose attracted so many moviegoers
to the Fulton that you could hardly
move, so the premiere was moved to
Mirage. But l’ll tell you straight out —
I still couldn't move. Maybe next time
they’ll try Three Rivers Stadium.

Anyway, I made contact with
Michael at this premiere, but I think I
should warn you about a couple of
things. This premiere thing, it was all
for him (of course preceeds went to the
Parental Stress Center ) but your son,
it seems, is a movie star now. And
these Pittsburghers, dressed in what
ranged from razzle-dazzle, sequined
evening gowns to faded jeans and polo
shirts, were just plain obnoxious. They
gathered so quickly and so closely in-
side the nightclub, it reminded me of
bees on honey.

And the line, damn it anyway. The
doors of Mirage supposedly opened at
six, yet a football-field length of a
waiting line stretched down Ninth
Street. More elite community members
made it no secret they were able to eke

feeling of fire, hurt and desire that is
behind every great blues voice.

As Willie, Joe Seneca brings a
sense of despair and grief, mixed with
a very strong sense of love (toward his
roots and eventually toward Eugene)
to life. His actions, gestures and voice
combine to bring a low-key sense of
gentleness and warm emotion to his

  

role. Willie is a liar, a womanizer (at
one time) and a murderer. But beneath
that coldness lies a warm and sensitive
man who loves the people around him.
lt’s for this reason that he’s willing to
risk his soul for Lightning Boy.

Also gracing this fine cast is Joe
Morton, whose performance in 1985’s
Brother From Another Planet was sim-
ply incredible (he played a mute extra-
terrestrial). Here he plays an evil
villain, the devil’s assistant, who en-
courages the young Willie to sign his
soul away in exchange for brief fame.
He turns up quite a few times through-
out the film through flashbacks and
eventually turns up to meet the aged
Willie. His performance is disturbing
and frightening. ut more than that, he
portrays a character with absolutely no
principles, scruples or morals and
does it with such grace and style that
he comes off looking clean. He’s a

their way to the front of the line by
strutting past the rest of the crowd.
Snotty damned uptights. Lucky for the
people at the end of the line that the
weather was holding out nicely.

I wish you could have seen all the
familiar faces. |’ll tell you, I felt like I
was in a nuclear fallout shelter in the
basement of a newsroom. Oh, there
were Jane Crawford, Debra Fox, and
Sally Wiggin and a few others who
haven’t really become household
names yet. Debra Fox was wearing
this shimmery navy blue silk tuxedo;
it looked wild on her. And Sally Wig-
gin, hell, she looked like she was about
to take flight wearing what looked like
a hot pink cobweb wrapped around her
shoulders. And who said that women
in Pittsburgh don't take chances with
fashion?

Speaking of fashion, exactly what
was Michelle Madoff wearing when
she stood up in the Fulton to give the
crowd a presidential wave? If the Post-
Gazette was there, we'd surely know.
And I'm talking in detail. Famous traf-
fic cop Lou Cianca was there, and so

was Franco Harris (he was selling raf-.

fle tickets for the Stress Center and
nodding his usual, “yeah, yeah,
yeah,” as if he knew what was going
on). “Master of Ceremonies” inside

slick character, and that’s the way he’s
portrayed. Morton is a consummate
performer who brings life and vitality
to every role he plays.

There are several themes at work in
this film. Some are so subtle that they
are hardly detectable. There are
several crossovers of themes and con-
tent as well. First, we have the issue

of old meeting new ~— tradition
meeting with modernity. Willie is tradi-
tion, and, of course, Eugene is the
new. The result of this blend is a har-
monic and sometimes cacophonous
melody that continues throughout the
picture. At work here also is the issue
of good versus evil. Willie may not be
the squeakiest clean of men, but his
intentions are pure and true. Pit
against this the evil of Satan (known
here simply as Scratch), and there is
a spark of conflict that at once raises
our hopes and increases our cynicism.
When Lightning Boy is. challenged in
Hell by a heavy metal guitarist for his
soul, there is a sense of good versus
evil that is more striking and profound
than any Rocky movie ever made. In
other words, this conflict is not only
strong but also necessary and crucial
to the film’s central themes.
Director Walter Hill (48 Hours and

the Fulton was 3WS's Trapper Jack
Elliott who’s obviously been looking at
too many GQ magazines from 1979.

When your son finally got to speak
in front of the crowd at Mirage, there
were a few girly-like giggle-shrieks. I
think Entertainment Tonight was there
somewhere, too. It seems Michael
hadn’t had‘ much sleep in the past 24
hours; something that had to do with
the Tonight Show, the Today show,
and now, get ready fellas — bigtime
Pittsburgh. Don't worry though, he
looked dashing (a bit cold, but dashing)
in a dark grey suit with a white shirt
and a burgundy tie. Someone buy the
boy a sweatshirt.

Luckily, your son probably skipped
dinner once inside Mirage. There was
plenty of kielbassa, but it was tough to
land some lunch meat ora hard roll.
And only the lucky ones found the
cheese (one would think Franco Har-
ris was raffling it off). I all but wrestled
with a woman who looked like Farrah
Fawcett in The Burning Bed, just for a
piece of swiss.

couldn’t tell exactly what they were

carrying _

Streets of Fire) has made his finest film
to ‘date. It's clear that the success of
this film is due to his concentration of
the human aspects of the story, rather
than the look of the film or the action,

W

as was apparent in his earlier work. He 

touches us emotionally without sugar-
coating the story or its charactrs. They
are a believable cast of misanthropes,

dreamers and streetwise innocents
that combine to make Croosroads a

' thoroughly enjoyable film.

Another important and influential
aspect of the film is, of course, the
music. Veteran composer and song-
writer*Ry Cooder did most of the
soundtrack and is responsible for a
fine selection of b|uesy,_ gutsy music
that creates a motif which lends at-
mosphere and feeling to a truly emo-
tional film. The impact of the music is

’ stunning.

Crossroads marks the second film in
which Macchio is taken under an old
loner’s wing and is shown the skills
and secrets of his craft. However, in
this film the characters are more in-
teresting, the plot is more intriguing
and the acting is infinitly better.
Crossroads is an engrossing film, and
one you’re not likely to be able to easily
forget.

Mrs. Keaton, Where have you gone wrong?

The mayor wasn't there (what’s his
name anyway?), but your son Michael
said some nasty things about him,
that’s for sure. He said, “Let’s light
some torches and go yank him out of
bed." And though I hate to be a tattle-
tale, he called the mayor an “illiterate
son-of-a-bitch.” But it got a laugh, so
I guess that’s all that’s important.

Speaking of laughs, that’s why I’m
writing you this letter. Your son has
become a star comedian, but once you
see his new movie, i think you’ll
understand why I'm resigning from this
case. Maybe you’ll disagree, after all
he is your son, but if you ask me, you
don't need a private detective. You
ought to be calling the Marines.

Sincerely,
STAN THOMAS WOZNIAK

Winning: Ogling Oscar for Hollywood’s Honor

By Matthew Yokoboskyu

Guesstimating who will win the
coveted Oscar come Monday is not an
easy task; since, given the nomina-
tions, one feels an intense desire to
recognize those who deserved inclu-
sion. Steven Spielberg, Cher, Mask,
Sean Penn, “This is Not America,”
Woody Allen and John Gielgud are a
few of the conspicuously missing; but
equally, there are those who did not
merit praise: Jon Voight, James
Garner, Robert Loggia, “Say You, Say

StevenmSpie|berg

Me,” Amy Madigan and Anne Ban-
croft. To win the Academy Award is the
largest plume in a(n) actor’s, director’s,
producer’s, technician’s seemingly
modest hat of self-dignity, though the
riches one receives far outweigh the
statue’s intended significance. To win
can be a lifetime triumph or a once-in-
a-lifetime tribute; though in the end,
books and admirers will always re-
member the fortunate’s achievement.

Best Picture: Popular opinion appears
to be for Prizzi’s Honor; but since
Spielberg won the Director's Guild
Award and wasn't himself nominated
by the academy, I feel that the

members will acknowledge The Color
Purple in reconciliation with Spielberg
accepting as its producer. Out of Africa
is an actor's and a writer's film,
Witness was released too early in the

John Huston

year and Kiss of the Spider Woman
dealt with a tabooed sexual
relationship.

Winner: The Color Purple

Director: Since Akira Kurasawa’s Ran
only garnered minor awards from the
Japanese Academy earlier this month,
and this is Peter (Witness) Weir’s first
nomination, they will be out of the run-
ning. Out of Africa was a showcase for
Meryl Streep, a woman who appears
to act independent of any director,
leaving Sydney Pollack in third place.
The competition is then between Hec-
tor Babenco for Kiss of the Spider
Woman and John Huston for Prizzi’s
Honor. While Babenco carefully
organized his film and convincingly
directed William Hurt and Raul Julia,
John Huston will win after the
academy’s failure to recognize him last
year for Under The Volcano.

Winner: John Huston, Prizzi’s Honor

Actor: James Garner, Murphy's
Romance, is known as a television ac-
tor; thus, the academy was being kind.
Harrison Ford played his first serious
role in Witness and will need to prove
himself further before winning. John
Voight, who was outstanding in Com-
ing Home, barely rivals that perform-
ance; leaving William Hurt for Kiss of
the Spider Woman and Jack Nicholson
for Prizzi’s Honor. Since Nicholson
won two years ago for Terms of
Endearment and few actors seem to
like him, the winner, though a long
shot, will be Hurt, who has maintained
distinctive quality throughout his
career.

Winner: William Hurt, Kiss of the
Spider Woman

Actress: It seems that this award will
be a draw — anyone could win. But
while Anne Bancroft was good, not
great, in Agnes of God, and Jessica

   

William Hurt

Lange was apt as Patsy Cline in Sweet
Dreams, neither performance was par-
ticularly outstanding. Meryl Streep in
Out of Africa was once again
marvelous, but since she is always

lauded laurels, the academy will forego
her another award. Whoopi Goldberg
is best known as a comedian, and
since this is her first nomination and
she did win the Golden Globe for The
Color Purple, she will have to prove
herself again before winning. It is sort
of like Better Midler’s situation with The
Rose. Thus, Geraldine Page, who has
been nominated eight times without an
Oscar, appears to be the favorite with
her brilliant portrayal of Mother Watts

Geraldine Page

in The Trip to Bountiful. I personally
think Meryl Streep does deserve to win
again, though.

Winner: Geraldine Page, The Trip To
Bountiful

Supporting Actor: The actors with the
least chance of winning in this
category are Robert Loggia (Jagged
Edge), who is barely memorable in his
role, and Eric Roberts (Runaway
Train), who I see as the most annoy-
ing and unconvincing actor in Holly-
wood. Don Ameche, while giving a
commendable. performance in
Cocoon, was aided by many other

Winner: Klaus Maria Brandauer, Out

Supporting Actress: The double
nomination of Oprah Winfrey and

tunately, neither will be given the gold.

Amy Madigan (Twice in a Lifetime) has
the least chance, since she has yet to
be recognized as an ‘‘actress.’' in Meg
TiIly’s case (Agnes of God) an Oscar
would be appropriate, but it appears
that her role was more of a leading-
actress role than a supporting. While

(Tilly was convincing as the nun who

immaculately conceived and then gave
the gift back to God, Angelica Huston’s
vengeful character in Prizzi’s Honor
hasa robust appeal, notwithstanding
she is Huston’s daughter.

His show is the greatest show on
earth, as far as the entertainment in-
dustry is concerned, because it is the
climax of Hollywood’s favorite guess-
ing game — “Who will win the
Oscar?” This year more than 500
million will see it via TV and satellite,
and when the delayed broadcast tapes
air in foreign countries, approximately
750 million will know who won the
golden Oscar.

Oscar is 58 years old this year. His
annual Academy Awards presentation
will take place Monday, March 24 and
be seen on the ABC Television
Network.

While we don’t know who will win
what on March 24 (Oscar is the most
secretive individual in the entire world),
we thought you’d like to quiz yourself
about Oscar and the Academy

Cool Cat Gone Astray

THE KNIFE FEELS LIKE JUSTICE
Brian Setzer
EMI America Records

What hath John Cougar Mellen—
camp wrought? The answer to that
question is a renewed interest in the
legacy of 1960s R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.
Brian Setzer’s The Knife Feels Like
Justice has arrived and qualifies as the
latest salute to '60s rock sensibility and
style. Unfortunately, Setzer nearly
screws up a pretty groovy album with
a large supply of high mileage
metaphors that could turn even
Bruce's cheeks red with
embarrassment.

The Knife Feels Like Justice is an
album that I would love to hate. The
problem is that Setzer has dropped the
phony rockabilly posturing of the Stray
Cats. Instead, he has tuned into an in-
spired blend of rock and R & B which
is pumped out by an explosive en-
semble that features the whomping
backbeat of Kenny Aronoff. Aronoff is
also Me||encamp’s drummer, the guy
who plays as if someone replaced his
sticks with ball peen hammers. His ag-
gressive style dominates the album’s
spare yet spacious sound.

The wide range ofstyles that Setzer
employs could instantly revive any dy-
ing beach party. He shifts effortlessly
from the Motown shuffle of “Bobby’s
Back” to the Byrdsy twelve-string
twang of “Aztec.” The timeless appeal

PITTSBURGH SOUNDTRACKS
Various Artists
itzy Records

Beyond the bar-band rock ‘n’ roll of
Pittsburgh groups of yore like The
Silencers, the Iron City House Rockers
and more recently Norm Nardini, lies
a young, thriving progressive music
scene. With Pittsburgh Soundtracks we
get a worthwhile, if sometimes incon-
sistent and incomplete, sampling of
some of the exciting original music be-
ing produced here in the city. Featur-

ing six area acts, the record show- ’

cases a wide range of musical styles.

Two songs from the duo Portable
People probably represent the least
appealing entries here. The band tries
to be funky on “Midnight Sweat Out”
and comes up short despite some fun-
sounding Dave Davies-reminiscent

of these songs almost lets you forget
how often Setzer comes off as a
knucklehead on this album.

“Chains Around Your Heart” is a
drippy, sentimental longing for sum-
mers gone by when this here town
would rip apart at the seams. Setzer
moans about a triple-level parking lot
which stands on the site of the old cor-
ner barber shop. At this point he has
completely exhausted his quota of an-
noying Springsteenisms. If “Chains”

_ has you scratching your head, prepare

yourself for “Three Guys,” wherein the
former Cat muses about the passing
of former Pretenders’ bassist Pete
Farndon. Setzer advises, Everybody
say a prayer each day, that oughta
keep the devil away. Even though the
singer assures us that he’s had no
visitors from Jupiter or Mars, I’m in-
clined to believe that Setzer’s space-
ship hasn’t touched down on earth for
quite some time, either. lt’s a shame
that so much great music is saddled
with such mindless lyricism.

The Knife Feels Like Justice would
make a great tape to pop into the
cassette deck of your Mustang conver-
tible this summer. Allow the album’s
classic rock ‘n’ roll drive to take you
back in time to swingin’ barbeques
hosted by Frankie and Annette. Feel
free to dance right through the soles
of your sandals. But try not to listen too
closely.

JOHN MCCOMBE

singing on the chorus. “Never Gonna
Let You Go” sinks under its needless
electronic excesses and woefully trite
lyrics.

The band Night Trik offers the con-
fusing “Love’s Gonna Make It,'’ a
song with a strong lead vocal and hard-

rocking guitar work that seems to belie '

the mellow-sounding chord progres-
sions. Entourage proves equally inof-
fensive, their upbeat song “Tell Me”
and the ballad “|’|l Do As You Say”
both predictable AOR-styled rock,
played enthusiastically enough and
with quality musicianship.

The other three bands provide much
more interesting work for the album.
Though not as catchy as their original
single “Waiting On a Change,” Kids
After Dark’s “Don’t Entertain Me” is
interesting breathy, trebly pop.
Especially notable are Jeff Herring's
bell-like percussion parts and fine sax

break. Wasted Talent, a punchy, up-
beat guitar-based band adds two ter-
rific rockers, ‘‘In and Out Of Love” and
“About Face.” The group has a unique
sound, with Joanne Galka skillfully
singing Bobby McCarthy’s two short,
direct compositions. And if the
dynamic “Walk Into The Night” from
The Affordable Floors is appealing, in-
telligent synthesizer-based music,
“Geneva,” the haunting tale of roman-
tic obsession turned watery death, is
all the more powerful and well-crafted.

Despite spotlighting some fine
bands, Pittsburgh Soundtracks had its
faults. Inclusion of songs by smart pop
rockers The Sponges and Son Of
John, and more “underground” bands
like A.T.S. and The Little Wretches,

would surely have upped the artistic

ante of the record. Updating some
material might have helped, too; the
new Kids After Dark song “Holliday

Green” is perhaps their finest and The
Affordable Floors’ song “The Sound-
ing,” recorded with the addition of new
band members, is as good as, if not
better than, these two earlier pieces.

Still, if one wants a decent overview
of some of Pittsburgh’s top original-
bands and the chance to have some
never-before-committed-to-vinyl songs
at hand, Pittsburgh Soundtracks offers
just that. The album should be avail-
able at most local record stores, but if
you have trouble finding it, contact itzy

clubs, where the music truly comes

think that we’d like to be. We’d like to
be extremely popular. We’d like to
reach people with our music and make
a career out of it so record companies
and these other kinds of business
things you just have to take care of and
you have to do.”

Unlike many bands, the Violent
Femmes have already escaped a lot of
corporate restraints with their in-
dependence untainted.

“[At first] everyone turned us down,
even the people we’re working with to-
day. We made that [first] album totally
on our- own and thought, well, if we
have to sell it door to door, then we’ll
just have to take that risk. So we went
in debt and everything and just did it.
And then Slash (the Femmes’ record
company) took it as a finished product,
which is to their credit. Even with the
finished product, other record com-
panies would say, ‘No,,that’s just a
demo tape and you have to make it
more like this or like that.’ ”

He paused with a sort of reflective
Jack Nicholson laugh and continued:
‘‘I remember one guy who said, ‘I
guess if we cut out the weird,~long kind
of songs, like “Add It Up,” I could help
shape you.’ He was one of the guys
responsible for Three Dog Night, and
we could’ve followed in their footsteps,
but we didn’t opt for that.”

No, it doesn’t seem like the urgen-
cy and desperation behind most of the
Femmes’ music could exist within that
kind of “Joy to the World” framework.
And it might have been that very mind-
set that pushed Gano into rock music
as a form of expression.

“A thought that would occur to me
here,” Gano said with a strange fond-
ness, "is that in high school,
sometimes, l’d get really sick and feel
very angry, like when l was stuck be-
ing somewhere where l’d have to listen
to the radio. There’d be some happy
song that made me feel worse and
didn’t seem to express anything that
l was feeling. So I would write songs
that would come from the same spirit
of what a blues song comes from.
Maybe it talks about some problem or
something that could be considered
down or twisted or ugly or whatever
and then through doing that l’d feel
better than if I was to try and sing some
light, carefree kind of song if I didn’t
feel that way.” Pulling back a bit and
settling in his chair, hecontinued, “So

cur to me, that I wanted to have
something of some real — for me,
what felt like -- substance. Life has a
lot of pain so it just seems to me that
it’s something I wanted to express.”

Can he still relate to the pain and in-
ternal drama of those days?

“Well, yeah,” Gano (still only 22

years old) said with a big grin. “Maybe H

always hear our first album or ‘classic

‘adolescent angst.’ And yet, let's say
they’re referring to someone desiring
physical intimacy. Well, when some-

absurd to think that people don’t feel
that way anymore.  Certainly, l’ve

wrote a song until now, that l have a

want to play them yet.”

Adolescent angst is not alone in
Gano’s songs. Sarcasm also seems to
play a very important role. Sometimes
it’s used as a shield or psychic defense
mechanism for Gano, and other times
it’s just off the cuff and sort of obnox-
ious and irreverent  or is it?

“There’s a lot of sarcasm,” Gano

said, quickly moving to clarify himself,
“though it’s definitely in the area of
irony rather than cynicism. I think that
you can really care and be ironic, and
it’s really personal, whereas cynicism
gets into another area. Yeah, there’s
a lot of irony in what we do, although
the type of song that most people
would consider ironic are the songs
that have no irony at all.”

The Gospel?

“Yeah, the Gospel, jexamplez
‘Jesus Walking on the Water’ and
‘F.A.l.T.H.’]” he laughs. “People say
‘Listen to the music. Listen to the
words. And the band [is] Violent
Femmes and they do all these other
songs jexample: ‘Add it Up’ and
‘Country Death Song’].”

“Yeah, -that’s not ironic. lt’s serious,
but it’s fun, too.”

I guess that’s not too surprising for
the son of an ordained Baptist minister.
But the seeming contradictions within
the music are still disturbing.

His mother, he said, “  is a huge

fan. She loves the band and the

 
   

songs.” Although, he admits, “the only
thing with her is that she’ll wish that l
wouldn’t on that one song say that one
word, you know, or whatever. But both
my parents are involved in professional
theater, so they can understand the
drama behind it.”

And that’s how it stands. The Violent
Femmes are still saying thatone word
at that one time, riding that thin line
between love and hate, between Amy
Grant and the Velvet Underground.
And they’re still vital, which is the way
Gano likes it.

“As amatter of fact, when we fin-
ished ‘Children of the Revolution,’
whenever I heard it, l’d start to laugh.
Really, l’d laugh out loud, in a kind of
delight that it didn’t sound anything like
us, and that’s fun.”

Showcase, March 21. 1986

By Stephen Morrison

A great friend of mine is
undergoing some rather appall-
ing surgery this Monday: He is
having his palate split down the

middle e clean through — so A

that the upper part of his head
may be widened and his jaw
completely reconstructed. They
will be implanting a device in his
upper mouth with a screw in the
middle that he will have to literal-
ly turn every day, thus widening
his head. He will be in unimag-
inable pain for the ‘next six
months. I am not making this up.
This week’s column is dedicated
to him.

Sigue Sigue Sputnik: Love Missile

_ Let it be known that Billy Idol was un-
questionably the brains (heaven help
us) behind Generation X. Sigue Sigue
Sputnik is the creation of former Gen.
X guitarist Neal X, and this single, a
fine candidate for the idiocy Hall of
Fame, was produced by none other
than the Flashdance-disco-sleaze-beat
kingpin himself, Giorgio Moroder.
Someone somewhere (who has
money) must have thought that this
unlikely team might produce
something intriguing; the reality,
however, is that Moroder and Mr. X
cancel each other out utterly. “Love
Missile" sounds like an ape ran amok
in the studio and laid waste all the
latest high-tech sound effects equip-
ment. The only distinguishing feature
of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, aside from
their undeniably expensive-looking
haircuts, is the band’s brain-damaged
infatuation with A Clockwork Orange.
Why is it that people with mental defi-
ciencies think that’s such a cool
movie?
 

D-minus

 

 

Mr. Mister: Kyrie

This song is everything MOR pro-
grammersdream about: it’s clean and
tight. it’s got that hook that everyone
remembers whether they want to or
not. And the band consists of nice-
looking, clean-cut, easily packageable,
marketable fellows. I have no animosi-
ty toward that mentality, but I won’t
hesitate to put it in its proper perspec-
tive. The American public wants nice,
safe, average music, and “Kyrie” is a
nice, safe, average song. it’s very 1986
sounding, certainly — it uses plenty of
technology and is in no way decadent,
other than in that the song itself could
have been written a decade ago —— but
it’s still nice, safe and average, and
that’s why you bought it. Just thought
i should tell you.

Pete Townshend: Give Blood

A colleague of mine at WPTS felt it
his duty to inform me that this song is
“dead”; in fact, he said, “lt’s been
dead for months.” I replied, with more
accuracy, that a song is not “dead”
until I say it is. “Give Blood,” as far as
l’m concerned, is very much alive,
thank you,_because I like it. it is by no
means earth-shattering, but neither is
it lacking in depth, texture, subject
matter or production, and it contains
a classic Townshend key-shift that
develops into a glorious ride-in-the-curl
coda. Why so many people choose to
boo Townshend as a brain-dead. ex-

1   _:
‘4_ _ - - _ _

rock-star has-been is beyond me:
“Give Blood,” while not as impressive
as its predecessor “Face The Face,”
is a solid, well-done, all-around good
song. Townshend has never had the
ability to write anything less, and his
current (relative) lack of popularity
merely confirms the suspicion that the
record-buying public thirsts for trivia,
banality and the dubious comfort of
sentimental adulation for Almighty
Youth. The irony is that a pop song can
be taken at any level one desires -
you can listen merely to the beat, get
into the chords, be moved by the
melody or, with a few artists like
Townshend, explore the lyrics for the
intellectual challenge. You can ignore
whatever facet of the song that doesn’t
jell with your mood. So why get uptight
because you've heard that a song-
writer is supposed. to be an “egg-
head?” if you’re only dancing, you
won’t notice any metaphorical brain-
food that may be contained in the
music, and you aren’t under any
obligation to. The only thing that mat-
ters is whether or not you like the song.
Townshend can still produce music
that compares, by any criteria, to
anything being done by the Bright
Young Bands that we know-it-all
overgrown babies adore. Jimmy Page
is a burned-out joke; Paul McCartney
is a wimp; but Pete Townshend is not,
and never has been, a “dinosaur,”
and no matter what The Who may
have degenerated into in the end,
Townshend has retained his dignity,
relevance and grace.

The Pogues: Poguetry In Motion

it’s too soon to declare that
there is an official “Celtic revival”
underway in Irish pop music, but
something does seem to be
brewing (no pun intended). The
Pogues are that rare instance of
an Irish band (or anything irish)
that has captured the hearts and
imaginations of the British:
They’re huge in England as well
as Ireland. What do they sound
like? Well, l’m almost tempted to
call them the Irish equivalent of
Madness, in the sense that they
are a large, well-organized, fun-
loving-but-with-a-serious-side
sort of band that write pop songs
firmly rooted in the traditional folk
music of their nation. Their
mounting success is readily iden-
tified by the fact that this lovely
little EP was produced by Elvis
Costello. '

“Poguetry In Motion” consists’
of four songs, all of high quality:
“London Girl,” the most modern-
sounding tune, with a pleasing,
radio-memorable hook and a
crowded pub atmosphere; “A
Rainy Night in Soho,” a ballad;
“The Body Of An American,” my
favorite, with a rousing chorus:
Fare thee well, l’ve gone away,
there ’s nothing left to say/
Farewell to New York City, boys,
to Boston and Pa./ He took them
out with a one-hand clout and we
often heard him say/ l’m a free-
born man of the U.S.A.! Nicely
capping the record is “P|anxty
Noel Hill,” a zesty reel with plen-
ty of accordion-led fun.

If you've never listened to Irish
music before, try The Pogues.
They offer tough, smart, uncom-
promising songwriting and lusty
musicianship. “Poguetry in M0-
tion” is as refreshing a.bunch of
songs as you’ll hear on either
side of the Atlantic.

A By Michael Blunt

If Stephen Foster were around to-
day, I imagine he would be honored to
have his name associated with Pitt’s
productions of Cloud 9 and The Glass
Menagerie. Because he is supposed to
have written some very catchy tunes
in his life, in this case he would proba-
bly be especially disappointed with
Strider, a play with music. In fact, I
would hope that these two composers
(Mark Rozovsky and S. Vetkin) feel a
little guilty for making the production’s
fine orchestra play the same tunes
over and over and over again.
Whoever said, “l love a musical,”
would have promptly gone across the
street to the New City Theater and
seen Painting Churches. Even an
energetic cast couldn’t bring this show
musically up to par.

Tom Corsetti’s choreography was
also a bit redundant; his talent was ex-
hibited only in.a few numbers. i could
understand the difficulty of his task,
however, as he was provided with the
same music again and again.

i am not suggesting this play be
made into something it's not, but just

Front and center, motorheads. Put
away that pansy literature, four-eyed

A worms. Bag your art wimpiness, fey
fruits. Brace yourselves for plenty of-

earth-shattering traction action tonight
and tomorrow at 8 p.m. when the
Budweiser U.S. Hot Rod Truck and
Tractor Pull Spring Championships in-
vade the Civic Arena. They’ll be kickin’
up plenty a mud ‘n’ slime as such
muted motor-rage powerhouses as
Bob Chandler and his Big Foot, a
veritable turf monster with 66-inch tires
and a 1000-horsepower engine, rip,
shred, crush and basically mangle,
conquer and crunch.

The Arena, whose air is always
awaft with the residue of flashpots,
power chords and sweaty grunts from
the collective rictus of masked men
and muscle-bound pretty boys, will be



that it be pushed a little more here and
there. Director Ann Marie Costa should
have realized the score was essentially
ascetic and endeavored to jazz it up a
bit. Some pizazz in the right places
would have made all the difference in
the world, and, I think, not have taken
away from the script. Robert Kalfin and
Steve Brown have done a classic job
with the book, and ultimately made the
script wonderful. It would have taken
a great deal of work to destroy it. It is
a script that is virtually actor-proof. And
no matter how you advertise, when you‘
see the phrase “musical,” or “a play
with music,” you tend to expect an ex-
travaganza involving lighting, choreog-
raphy, book and score. Vivacious
music is expected, rather than hoped
for. There should be new ideas in
blocking and movement. Costa’s
Strider reflects only one of the virtues
listed above, and, sadly, it is the work
of Leo Tolstoy, not hers.

What, then, is the script about. This
is not an easy question to answer. The
leading role is Strider, a horse who is
both human and four-legged at once,
with insight few of us have. Mark
Gruber plays Strider rather well, and

a bloomin’ and a buzzin’ with the
gristle-gouging, viscera-stomping

buzzsaw drone of souped-up, psycho
wheels banging heads in the torrid
muck of motor sport madness; com-
petition on a scale so grandiose it
takes two nights and an arena to con-

 

is able to show us pain and joy, love
and hate, the concept of my and mine,
all though equine eyes. Gruber has the
audience in the palm of his hand as the
pitiful piebald horse, who guides us
through an astounding array of emo-
tion. Gruber is enticing and keeps the
whole production above water.

Erica Magnus is an old gypsy

_ woman who powerfully controls most

of the action on stage, and vibrantly
cues the orchestra during the course
of the play. Magnus represents a
spiritual look at life and death, and
adds intrigue and spice to the show.
Magnus has created this role along
with director Costa. It is nowhere to be
found in the script. This should be
specially noted.

Tim Meyers is fun to watch. His col-
orful characterization as Prince Ser-
puhousky sets the mood whenever he

speaks. He is very similar to Strider,

They never speak to each other, even
though a lot of the time they are think-
ing the same thing," and reacting in the
same way.

Donna Harfenist plays the prince’s
lover adeptly and sings well, but
seems a little awkward dancing."

tain it. The domes may have to be
opened to make room for all the fren-
zy; the Arena will be transformed into
a coliseum of motor mania — the
equivalent of a triple metal bill and a
battle royal-steel cage match, all at
onl!

Harfenist, too, has done a good job in
all of her four roles!

Darling, Strider’s most fierce com-
petitor, is played by Tom Corsetti. Dar-
ling is a pure-white yearling who
catches the eye of his owner, his
stablemates and the audience. Corset-
ti is light on his feet, and plays his four
parts ably, especially as Darling.

Harry Bouvy, Jean-Pierre Nutini,
Paul Ford and Mitchell Howard com-
plete the team of leading players, each
doing his best to bring the play alive.
Well, by the second act not quite alive.
Maybe comatose and responding to
deep-pain stimulus. The rest of the
cast — Catherine Fountain, Patti Kel-
Iy, Mary Jo Kelly, Rebecca Gruber,
Genia Miller, Stephen Sirulnik and
Robert Steele —— all contribute aptly.

Henry Heymann’s set is a raked
masterpiece, but all of his sets this
season have been magnificent. This is
to be expected, though, as Mr.
Heymann has designed world pre-
miere sets for the New York City
Opera, and 49 sets for the Santa Fe
Opera.

memYa’ Gotta Love Le Cafeww

By David Zuchowski

The Pitt News restaurant sleuths
have tracked down a real find this
week, a fabulous eatery just a stone’s
throw or a short jaunt away from cam-
pus, in fashionable, chic, au current
Shadyside — Le Petit Cafe. If formal
dining in comfortable surroundings fits
your plans for a romantic, specific oc-
casion, Le Petit Cafe fits the bill.

Even a quick coup d’oiel upon enter-
ing the restaurant will reveal the ob-
vious fact that management here pays
close attention to detail and to even the
most trifling amenities. The ambience
is sparkling, spotless, near perfect in
the arrangement of the furnishings and
dining accoutrements. If soft, pleasant
music provided the tempo, then the
revolving ceiling fans, large potted
plants and glimmering candles set the
mood.

But when all is said and done, the
proof of any pudding lies in the eating.
As an overture to the repast that fol-
lowed, we began our meal with two
scintillating appetizers, Artichout Froid

au Dijon ($4.95) and Escargots
Bourguinonne ($4.75). The artichoke
was tender and fresh, served with a
marinade of tangy mustard vinaigrette
and garnished with chopped, hard-
cooked egg and diced pimento.

The escargot was sauteed in garlic
butter, shallots and brandy and served
in the shell. As were all the selections
we sampled, the escargot was artfully
presented and garnished and redolent
in its appearance.

For our next course we chose
Coeurs de Palmier Flavigots ($3.25)
and the Potage du Jour ($3.25). The
salad was a beautiful serving of
chunks of heart of palm carefully
marinated in vinaigrette dressing,
dappled with diced pimento, scallions
and chopped shallots.

We excitedly moved on to our next
course hoping that another treat
awaited us, and we were not disap-
pointed. We ordered one of the
specials written on the chalkboard, a
mesquite-grilled Swordfish Steak with
Sauce Charon ($14.95) and from the
regular menu, Canard aux Peches
($13.95). The swordfish was a large,

gently tender moist steak, perfectly
done, delicately smoked by the mes-
quite charcoal and enhanced by a
velvety-textured Sauce Charon
(basically a hollandaise made with tar-
ragon vinegar, flavored with shallots
and colored by a rich tomato paste).

The duck was half a grill-blushed,
Long Island duckling with a crackling
skin and tender juicy flesh, mated with
a buttery peach sauce garnished with
fresh peach slices and watercress, ac-
companied by a dollop of foie gras
dressing. Both of the entrees came
with a side plate of thinly julienned,

sauteed yellow squash, red and green ‘

bell pepper, zucchini and carrot,
cooked al dente and enhanced by a
dab of garlic buenne blaric.

With such fine gastronomical
largesse already under our belts, we
felt that neglecting the dessert menu
would be an insult to both the chef and
our host. So we ambled on to a fitting
climax, a homemade chocolate waffle
with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream,
covered with a silken chocolate sauce
and a generous sprinkling of chopped
pecans ($4.25) and two ceramic pots

   

of Creme Brulee ($4.50), topped with
a red raspberry sauce and brown
sugar, hardened by placing the chilled
ramekins under the grill for a few
moments. _
Lighter appetites may opt for less
hearty fare such as Quiche du Jour
($5.50), Angel’s Hair Pasta with
tomatos and capers ($6.25), a coquille
of scallops, mussels, lobster ‘and
shrimp with cheese ($5.75), or Salade
Nicoise ($6.25). But whatever the fare,
Le Petit Cafe is deserving of a rave

review, and is a prime example of Pitts-'

burgh’s movements towards the gen-
trification of food.

The orchestra, led by David Bud-
way, played the redundant score
superbly. Violin player Leo Budway
added a certain brilliance to it. John
Flampola performed his tasks as per-
cussionist and sound-effects master
with seeming ease.

Strider is an unusual “play with
music” that is beautifully written, and

should have been “a play without
music.” The second act was almost
exactly the first act, and therefore had
me questioning its inclusion.

All in all, Strider is saved by the per-
formances of Mark Gruber, Erica
Magnus, Tim Meyers and Tom Corset-
ti. if these performers had been one
iota less prepared, the show would
have collapsed,

Strider runs through March 29 at the

Rose

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Basketball coaches have been known
to foam at the mouth with the possibil-
ity of becoming a field general in the
Big East Conference. But if South
Florida head coach Lee Rose engineers
a Big East team next season. it will be
Pitt who does the slobbering.

Rose is the latest. and possibly the
best, candidate hoping to fill the shoes
of Roy Chipman. Chipman resigned
last December, effective at the season’s
end.

Rose — who has never had a losing
season in his 19 coaching years in the
collegiate ranks — was interviewed by
Pitt officials Thursday, joining former
Cleveland Cavalier coach George Karl
and Navy’s Paul Evans as the leading

“After Chipman an-
nounced he was retiring, we
had no discipline. ”

—— Reggie Warford

candidates.

Pitt officials have expressed that
they’re looking for a coach with a win-
ning tradition. But more importantly,
this coach—to—be must be able to exhibit
complete control over his players.

“We’re looking for a successful
Division I coach,” said Dean Bi-llick,
assistant athletic director. “There are
certainly many characteristics that
we’re looking for and certainly [a
disciplinarian] is one of them.”

Rose has many of the characteristics
Billiek is looking for.

Rose has racked up a 388-162 record
in his eight seasons at Transylvania
University, three at North Carolina-
Charlotte, two at Purdue and six at
South Florida.

Unlike Chipman whose teams have
bowed out of the Big East Tournament

Sports  

in the first round of each of his four
years in the conference, Rose has prov-
en he can win a post—season game or
two.

He has twice led his squads into the
NCAA Toumamenfs prestigious Final
Four. Rose put tiny North Carolina-
Charlotte on the map in 1977 by shock-
ing the basketball world as he led the
team into the NCAA’s semiﬁnal round.
And two years later, Rose proved his
ability to coach was no fluke when he
and All-America center Joe Barry Car-
roll led Purdue into the Final Four.

According to South Florida Assistant
Sports Information Director John Ren-
nker, Rose’s success as a basketball
coach derives directly from his ability
to get his players to respect him. In
fact, it’s like a teacher—student
relationship.

“If you could ever see him work
with the team,” Rennker said. “It’s
like a classroom. He’s a very organized
person and he has the ability to get his
players to do everything to plan. It real-
ly is like a classroom on the court.”

Reggie Warford, an assistant coach
under Chipman, hinted that discipline
was the major reason Pitt struggled to
a 15-14 record this year, despite being
a favorite in the pre-season to finish at
least third in the Big East Conference.

“After Chipman announced he was
retiring,” Warford said, “we had no
disipline. If Chipman doesn’t retire,
we’d have won 22 games this season.”

Billiek would not confirm that Rose
had been interviewed, but he did say
that the field has been narrowed
drastically.

Rose, 44, was interested in seeking
employment elsewhere after South
Florida’s athletic budget was cut
severely prior to the 1985-86 season.
When an assistant coach left for a head
coaching job, Rose was unable to hire
a replacement. The end result of the
budget cut was a disappointing 14-14
record for South Florida —- Rose’s
worst record in his 19 years.

“Lee’s very unhappy over the
budget —- that’s a known fact,” Renn-
ker said. “It wouldn’t surprise me at
all to see him leave.”

Although it is probable that Rose
would accept a position at Pitt should

Gottfried begins spring   drills today  

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
begins his first set of spring drills as
head of the Panther coaching staff this
afternoon at Pitt Stadium. Several
players, for a variety of reasons, will
be absent from this year’s spring drills.

Sophomore tailback Brian Davis,
Pitt’s third leading rusher last year with
298 yards on 60 carries, heads the list
after being suspended lasLweek for not
meeting requirements established for
squad members.

Davis was rumored to be shopping
around for a new school, but he said,
“I am not off the team. I can still come
back and practice in the fall if I want.”

Missing along with Davis will be

receivers Dexter Hairston and Tony
Williams. Both players were suspend-
ed from school following campus alter-
cations and neither will participate in
football at Pitt ever again.
Sophomore fullback Craig Heyward
goes in front of a district magistrate this

Notebook

afternoon to find out his fate. Heyward
is charged with simple assault and
harassment of a 12-year-old paperboy
in South Oakland. Gottfried said he will
wait until the outcome of the hearing
to decide whether or not to take

disciplinary action against Heyward.

Heyward, a native of Passaic, N.J . ,
sat out last season on disciplinary pro-
bation after he struck another Pitt stu-
dent with a crutch.

Two Pitt offensive linemen may ﬁnd
themselves on crutches as they
recuperate from knee injuries. Center
Ed Miller and tackle Chuck Williams
will not practice this spring, but it is
hoped that they will be able to par-
ticipate in fall drills at Edinboro
University.

Miller, a 6-4, 260-pound sopho-
more, suffered the injury playing
basketball last summer. He missed the
entire 1985 season. Williams, a 6-6,
255-pound junior, played sparingly due
to injuries in 1985.

With a knack for building winners, Gottfried has proven one thing:
he is and has been a success.

He has turned losers into winners at Murray State, Cincinnati and
Kansas, and can continue the great football tradition at Pitt.

New Pitt cheerleading squad selected

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

The l986-87 Pitt cheerleading squad
was selected last week following
tryouts at Trees Hall. The squad, which
consists of 12 women and 10 men, will
debut at Westmoreland Mall in
Greensburg on April 4.

Heading the squad, under the direc-
tion of cheerleading coaches Theresa
and Mike Nuzzo, are returnees Leslie

 

  

Pitt’s cheerleadin quad ﬁnished flfh nionally in

Albert, Natalie Ciferno. Maria Jaeger,
Darla Ramirez, Tara Thomas and San-
dy Kraft. Marian Schmitt, a member
of the squad two years ago, rejoins the
team and will serve as ﬁeld captain.
New additions to the squad include
Kelly George, Teresa Saltarelli, Tina

Jaeger, Laura Macaravage and Susan

The male contingent is comprised of

Goodwin. Terry Brown also returns for
another year and will serve as men’s
captain. New additions to the men’s
squad include Mike Hynes, Mark
Halbedl, Jim Hendrickson and Dave
Johnston.

In addition, John Walker will return
for another year as the Panther mascot.

The new members will attempt to
keep up the high standards that were
set by the squads of the two previous
years. The 1985 squad competed in
Hawaii and finished seventh national»
ly. Last year’s squad ﬁnished 12th in
the nation after competing in Orlando,
Fla. Pitt was the only squad from the
Northeast region to be invited.

Since the Nuzzos, both four—year
cheerleaders at Pitt, have taken over the
squad, cheerleading at Pitt has evolved
from cute girls in skirts to men and
women executing skills from gym-
nastics to complex partner stunts. The
men follow a strict weight training pro-
gram, while the women keep to their
weight requirements through gym-
nastics and aerobic exercises.

The Nuzzos own and operate The
Elite Cheerleading Organization, a
company that instructs junior and
senior high school cheerleaders. The
company operates in 12 states and has
choreographed routines for some of the
top high school squads in the nation.

Pitt’s new squad, in addition to per-
forming at Westmoreland Mall on
April 4, will also perform at Pitt spring
football games and the “Celebration of
Excellence” dinner, which will be held
at the David L. Lawrence Convention
Center in honor of Pitt’s 1976 National
Championship football team.

Wage *2'1

Pitt’s cheerleaders are more than just cute girls in
skirts, but they still have that quality.

Penguins eye playoff berth as season closes

By Jim Pietras
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Penguins are current-
ly involved in a neck-and-neck strug-
gle with the New York Rangers for
fourth place in the Patrick Division.
The Penguins currently hold a one-
point lead over the Rangers. The Pens
have eight games remaining, while the
Rangers have nine. Neither team has
an easy schedule remaining, and the
race might go down to the last game
of the season when the two face off on
April 6 in Madison Square Garden.

Mario Lemieux continues to lead the
Penguins in scoring with 133 points
despite having his 28—game scoring
streak end in Monday night’s loss to
the Washington Capitals. The streak
was the second longest in the NHL this
year and the fourth longest in NHL
history. In his last 20 games, Lemieux
has scored 18 goals and 24 assists for
a total of 42 points. Of those 20 games,
Lemieux scored twice in 15 of them.

Terry Ruskowski continues to lead
the NHL in shooting percentage.

ing the streak Ruskowski scored 10

shoithanded goals (3).

The Pittsburgh Spirit also is involved

recorded 19 more points over last
season, scoring 39 more goals while
allowing 75 fewer goals to opponents.

Wednesday nights 7-3 victory over
the New Jersey Devils was the Pens’
first road victory since Feb. 21 when
they defeated the Red Wings 7-3 in
Detroit.

In other Pens news, right winger
Tom Roulston has been recalled from
the Baltimore Skipjacks of the
American Hockey League. In 70
games with the Skipjacks, Roulston
scored 37 goals and 47 assists for 84

one-half games behind the Dallas
Sidekicks and the Minnesota Strikers.
The Spirit has seven games remaining.
while the Sidekicks and Strikers have
six each.

Forward Godfrey Ingram leads the
Spirit in scoring with 44 points, fol-

lowed closely by forward Paul Child ,

(40) and defenseman Helmut Dudek
(37). Since joining the Spirit during the
season, controversial forward Stan
Terlecki has scored 23 points with 16
goals and seven assists in 22 games.

Goalie David Brcic continues to have

goals-against average. Numbers like
these are what made Brcic the
goaltender in the MISL All—Star game.

The Spirit faces the Sidekicks -on
Sunday afternoon in Dallas. A Spirit
victory would allow them to win their
series with the Sidekicks outright.
which would be the first tie—breaker
should the two teams end up in a
regular—season tie. _

The Pirates are 3-6 in Grapefruit
League action thru Wednesday’s game
against the Minnesota Twins. Manager
Jim Leyland‘s squad seems to be hit-
ting much better this year, perhaps due
to the fact that Leyland runs a much
tighter ship than former skipper Chuck
Tanner.

The Pirates have already sold
500,000 tickets, better than two—thirds
of the way toward last season’s atten-
dance figure of 735,900. The Pirates
will need to more than triple that
figure, however, to break even. It is
estimated that 1.6 million fans will
have to go see the Bucs if the team is
to break even. Optimistic estimates by
management put attendance in the

As I see it

Page 23

By Jim Brueckner

Baseball not a business but an obsession for these players

"It was all I lived for. to play ball.“
— Mickey Mantle

It began as a game. an emotional
deliverance from the woes of life. It
was intended to be passive indulgence
for all ages. It has far surpassed its
original motives. It has become a
source of rapture for the most fervent
0_l;_§1,iSP_‘;'iiesii These people suffer a pas-

_/"‘§ionate obsession for this athletic

endeavor. They are only “alive“ when
rejoicing in its delights. Almost every
action of the day is tied to it in some
fashion. It is the most unshakable ad-
diction once it attacks. But the victims
feel no remorse.

“I’d walk through hell in a gasoline
suit to keep playing baseball.”
— Pete Rose

These people experience a unique ex-
istence. Their religious devotion to this
seemingly innocent game has left them
at a level of insanity unmatched by any
of the more controversial cults that
have taken hold over those searching
frantically for the very secret of life.
But these, the followers and par-
ticipants of this game, feel that they
have found the one true answer! They
are convinced that the universe rotates
around the actions that take place on
a diamond-shaped ﬁeld. To them, this
is the highest form of art forms. To
them, this is the consummation of man.
To them. this is life itself.

“Baseball is simply a dramatization
of the life struggle of a man.”
— Walter Johnson

This magnificent, majestic spectacle
could have taken place within the con-
fines of the Roman Coliseum. Such is
the royal nature of this athletic en-
counter. But instead, it was born and
raised on American soil. It has been
played in beautiful, green, country
fields and in dirty, dusty sandlots. It
matters not where it is played because
it supplies its own breathtaking beau-
ty. It eliminates the problem of the day
and sustains in its participants. the
breath of life.

"Within the ballpark. time moves
differently. marked by no clock except
the events of the game  Since in
baseball. time is measured only in outs.
all you have to do is succeed utterly:
Keep hitting. keep the rally alive. and
you have defeated time. You remain
forever young."

— Roger Angell

One cannot condemn the followers
for seeking perpetual youth. It is a pur-
suit that most would attempt if they
thought it plausible. America gave birth
to this quest in the 1840s. It has since
become the foundation of American
culture. Most of those foreign to our
land fail to understand the dire necessi-
ty for the existence of this athletic
engagement.

“Whoever wants to know the heart
and mind of America had better learn
baseball.”

— Jacques Barzun

It is a general acceptance that soon
after birth, a child is whisked away to
one of these ﬁelds of endeavor and
taught the implications of being an
American citizen. They must engage in
this bizarre activity, for it has all of the
raw essentials necessary for an earthly
existence. They are also taught to
follow the ongoing saga of the masters
of this trade.

“Baseball is continuous, like nothing
else among American things, an end-
less game of repeated summers, join-
ing the long generations of all the
fathers and all the sons.”

— Donald Hall

This game is fancied to be the secret
to being a fine citizen. It pulls would-
be delinquents off the streets and
redirects their lives in a more reputable
direction. It has preserved the souls of
many. If someone imports scandal in-
to this, the greatest of all spectacles,
he is deemed the most lascivious of all
criminals by the public. The purists
berate him for abusing the privilege of
association with this grand old game.
But it must be stressed that this is the

Gottfried

continued from page 19

On the lighter side, one player who
no one expected to see practicing this
spring in a Pitt uniform is quarterback
John Congemi. The three—year starter
from Lauderdale Lakes, Fla,. has of-
ficially received another year of
eligibility from the NCAA and will
practice with the team beginning this
afternoon.

Congemi, second only to Dan
Marina in most Pitt passing-career
records, was injured as a freshman in
his only performance of that year — a
junior varsity game — and recently ap-
pealed to the NCAA for an extra year
of play.

Pitt will hold two spring games dur-
ing Gottfried’s first campaign as head
coach.

The first will be held at Belle Ver-
non High School on April 1 l. The
game will be sponsored by the Man
Valley Chapter of the Pitt Golden Pan-
thers. with all proceeds benefitting the
Mon Valley YMCA. Kickoff is at 7:30
p.m.

The annual Blue—Gold Game will be
held at Pitt Stadium on April 28 at 5:30
p.m.

exception to the rule. This game is
predominantly a savior to the young.

“There is nothing better calculated
than baseball to give a growing boy
self—poise and self—reliance."

— Alben Spaulding

It has brought forth many Americans
from the depths of destitution. It has
rescued many youths whose lives were
trapped in an intricate maze from which
there seemed no escape. and it has
given them a means of redemption. It
has also aided its adherents in tem-
porary ﬂight from the drudges of day-
to-day living. In this. the land of op-
portunity, it provides an opportunity
for a peerless thrill. While many ex-
pel vacuous words of loyalty, this ex-
hibition has proved to be unimpeach-
ably American.

“Baseball has done more to move
America in the right direction than all
the professional patriots with their
billions of cheap words.”

— Monte Irvin

It has been depicted as the ultimate
“oasis in the desert.” There has been
no greater understatement. It has been
the jewel of the American public for
generations. Its followers divide the
people of the world based on their

perception of this game. One can at-
tain a no more eminent status than that
of an experiencer of this celebrated and
blessed event.

"I believe that all men who have
lived and achieved success in this
world. had lived in vain if they knew
not baseball."

— Senator Chauncey Depew

It is said that those who exist without
this devotion live in a bleak. dismal and
desolate world.

But those who are able to feel its
emanating warmth are the chosen ones.
It is a fortune of boundless wealth.
There is. however, no greater fortune
than the priceless memories of past
warriors of the diamond. These men
are heroes of a mythical nature. They
are strangers to us all, yet we accept
them as brothers.

“He was a parade all by himself, a
burst of dazzle and jingle. Santa Claus
drinking his whiskey straight and
groaning with a bellyache caused by
gluttony  Babe Ruth made the music
that his joyous years danced to in a con-
tinuous party. What Babe Ruth is,
comes down, one generation handing
it to the next, as a national heirloom.”

— Jimmy Cannon

The heroes are an integral part of our
nature. We rejoice in their triumph.
suffer in their pain. In 1939, one of
these heroes was found to be dying of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at a young
age. Despite his imminent early
demise, he felt himself blessed because
of his interaction with this wondrous
game. As a dying man cried out to the
masses. the emotional remunerations of
this game were never more evident..
The brave warrior stood tall.

"Fans. for the past two weeks. you
have been reading about what a bad
break I got. Yet today I consider myself
the luckiest man on the face of the
Earth."

—— Lou Gehrig

Lou Gehrig and anyone else who has
ever been connected with it, knows the
sweet joys that can come from this
game. It is truly a gift to us all.

But one must be careful not to
misread where the true treasure lies.
While the professional warriors are to
be commended for their magnanimous
achievements, it is the game of baseball
itself that is to be worshiped, not its
players. Once that is realized, the joys
are neverending and life is a celebra-
tion. Thank God for Alexander Cart-
wright and his wonderful invention.

Without baseball, life just wouldn’t
be the same.
