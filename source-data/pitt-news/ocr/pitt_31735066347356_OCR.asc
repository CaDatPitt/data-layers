Partial Status

BY DVEANNA LOUISE

The Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC) soon to petition for full
organizational status, hopes to gain
exemption from Student Govern-
ment guidelines which require
Legal Awareness to undergo a three
month observation period of partial
recognition during transition from a
Student Government committee to
an autonomous organization, LAC
Chairman Michael Silverman said
recently.

Silverman explained the Com-
mittee is planning to seek
organizational status because “we
want to have the freedom to run
things our own way should the need
arise.”

The Student Government regula-
tions require any group with at least
25 members seeking organizational
status, draw up a constitution, elect
officers and submit to a honeymoon

period of three months. During this I

time, the group can receive no more

member of management and the
handbook rules do not apply to
him.” ~

Earlier Affirmative Action
spokesman William Lenaghen told
Lowe the handbook regulations do
apply to him, as they do to all
officers with job classification
numbers. Whether this classifica-
tion number is the same for all

officers except Chief Graham, as

Lenaghen contends, or functions
only as a payroll number and does
not apply to the handbook, as
Dutton insists, has been a matter of
controversy.

In the first two levels of the
grievance procedure Lowe appealed
to ‘both Graham, who refused to
justify the charges, and Dutton,

 

(

who backed Graham’s decision to
ﬁre Lowe.

“I still back what Graham did,”
Dutton said, “He acted for the
University’s good will. ’ ’

Lowe was ﬁred on charges of’

insubordination by Campus Police
Chief Curt Graham on November
11, after he deﬁed Lt. Jim Heagy’a
order to split the 12-hour night shift

L with two union men who crossed the

strike lines and returned to work.
At the time, Lowe challenged his

dismissal on the grounds of

insubordination, since, according to
the Campus Police handbook, a
person can be fired for insubordina-
tion only if the same charges have
been ﬁled within the past twelve
months.

Lowe’s dismissal arose, sources

preference to returning Amal-

Student Activities

Gets New Director

BY PAUL MATHEWS

The new director of student
activities, Mr. Willard “Bud”
Heaps, said yesterday the Univer-
sitylshould fully recognize the
importance of student participation
in extra-curricular leadership roles.
' -“I’d like to see the student

activities office develop a leader-

ship training program offering a
system of courses to students
through the Student Union,” he
said.

Heaps, 35, is at Pitt this week for
three days of orientation and will
ofﬁcially become the new head of
the student activities office later
this month. He ﬁlls the position

Student Activities Nancy Evans,
who resigned the directorship last
September.

Later this week, Heaps will return
to the State University of New York
at Oswego to resignhis position
there as director of student

activities.

‘ ‘The first thing we will do when I
get back is a self-evaluation of the
student activities office to see where
improvements can be made.

“I would like to see this office
look ahead to the future and become
more conceptual, engaging in a
kind of preventative advising
rather than being crisis oriented,”

he said.

Heaps also said he will work
toward developing more of a sense
of teamwork and a sharing of
advising responsibilities in the
student activities ofﬁce than that

which exists currently.

at other universities. “I would like
to see if the SGB could become a
more viable organization.

“I would also like to see an
increase in visible educational
things within Schenley Hall. This
could include more exhibits with an
emphasis on arts and crafts,”
Heaps said.

Heaps has a B.A. in music from
Thiel College and an M.A. in
administration of colleges and
universities, with an emphasis on
student affairs, from New York

“LAC can’t possibly operate with
only $100. Our lawyers alone cost
$3600 every year,” LAC Chairman
Michael Silverman said in support
of the exemption.
Although the Committee on
Student Organizations implements
the SG regulations, only the Board

has the power to exempt the partial ‘

recognition period.

Silverman said they would
probably ask CS0 to write a letter
recommending the exemption to the
Board.

If the SGB refuses to wave the
partial recognition period, Silver-
man said, the Legal Awareness
Committee would probably remain
a committee.

“Direct funding from the Alloca-
tions Committee, instead of through
student Government would make
everything more organized,” Sil-
verman said.

The other requirements for
organizational status Silverman

said, will be filled easily. He. said a"

constitution has been drawn up and
unanimously approved, and an
election of officers will be held soon.

Year of the Panther

_It’s been a matter of fact to Pitt students for the past few months. B111
it was made ofﬁcial yesterday by the Associated Press’ sportswriter’s
poll and Mondayby United Press International’s coaches’ poll.

The Pitt Panthers are the number-one college football team in the

country.

It was a year like none before and one that may never be equalled. The
Panthers’ undefeated season provided many an exciting Saturday

afternoon for Pitt students.

‘Tony Dorsett’s string of NCAA records, his Heisman Trophy, the
decisive victory over -arch-rival Penn State and the sweet sinking of
Georgia in the ‘Sugar Bowl; all these accomplishments have earned
Johrmy Majors’ 1976 team a place in the University’s football history
beside the legendary teams’ of Jock Sutherland and Pop Warner.

This was the ninth time Pitt was chosen the top college football team in
the country. But unfortunately, it is the only time a number-one Pitt
teamwill be a Johrmy Majors product as he has resigned to assume the
duties of head football coach at the University of Termessee.

Though the student body relished the thought of a Majors dynasty at
Pitt, the years he did spend here are cherished, and the best of luck is

wished him for the new job at his alma mater.

1977 brings Jackie Sherrill, Majors’ former right-hand man, as the
new head coach. Frequenters of Oakland taverns already are starting to
debate his qualiﬁcations. They wonder if he can produce another _
nationally ranked team or if he has recruited people to ﬁll the shoes of
Dorsett, Rormno, and the other graduates. Nobody will know until this

time next year. (

Letter to the Editor

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Assuming for one, egocentric
moment, that historians will one
day ﬁnd these times and these years
of interest, it may be that they will
put their finger on the hour and the
minute_when we lost sight of the
individual as the base’ rock of
society. ' -
They might well search to answer
the question: When did these
people surrender up the idea of the
individual as the. basic unit of
society? .
When did it happen that men and
women became agents of policy,
instead of policy the agent of men
and women?
The truth is that, for a nation of

Another Business School?  

As an advisor in the College of
Arts and Sciences I have noticed a
serious defect in the structure of the

I . University of Pittsburgh; the lack of
. V a comprehensive undergraduate

business program. It has been my
impression that the majority of
students at this institution have
decided to attend Pitt for some
combination“ of the three following
reasons; tuition costs are relatively
low,, the school is usually not very
far from home, and finally there is
the belief (and hope) that someday a
degree will be ‘ transformed into
dollars and cents.

Unfortunately, very few of the

’ degree programs offered by CAS

are,career- or job-oriented. While
the university seems» to have a ﬁne
track record with respect to placing
its students into professional and
graduate programs, the majority of
students‘ are forced to enter the
“Real World” armed with BAs in
English, history, political science
and other such ﬁelds. Perhaps a
handful will ﬁnd employment in

 fields related to their majors, but I
e ‘} presume that the majority are
‘ forced to compete for jobs in

business with people holding
degrees in marketing, finance,

accounting and business adminis-

tration. Perhaps I am overreacting
to the present recession, but it
seems that this competition is
unfair.

It is not that Pitt undergraduates
are unaware of this problem. One
need only to consult the course
closing sheets during the first week
of registration that indicate that the
handful of business courses offered
are usually the first to fill up. As an
advisor, I‘ ﬁnd it frustrating to tell
people that 1) their B.A. is worth
little in the job market and 2) that
the business courses that they had
hoped to take were closed out on the
second day of registration.

In attempting to discover why a

university of Pitt’s size and caliber

........«.x.-, . : . 4 . ; a o A s n x tn

does not have an undergraduate
business school; ‘I discovered the
following: 1) A number of years ago,
Pitt had a business college,
however,’ a former chancellor
decided that Pitt should become
another Cornell and thus, the
university was restructured and the
business college was lost in the
process. Unfortunately two items
were overlooked: a)There is a
substantial difference in the types
of students attending the respective
schools. b)Comell does have a
business college, it is cleverly
disguised as the College of Hotel
and Restaurant _Management.
2) Many have argued that the
,institution of a business college
would have a serious impact on the
enrollments of Point Park and
Robert Morris College. While I
agree that this is a problem, it is
obvious that a business college at
Pitt would be of a much higher
quality than those ‘at the above
mentioned schools.

/3) A number of people in the
Graduate Business School are
opposed to the idea of an
undergraduate business program.
While I don’t know the rationale
behind their opposition, I would
guess that an undergraduate
business college would serve as a
boon to the, graduate program.
Since the pndergraduate program
Would probably take place under the

 

auspices of the graduate and the
latter would beneﬁt from the
increase in funding, faculty size,
classroom space and library facili-
ties that would occur over time, the
prestige of the Graduate School
would be well served.

4)Many departments in CAS are
opposed to the idea since they
conceive of a business school in zero
sum terms, i.e., the business
school’s gain in funding, faculty and
enrollment would be the loss of
CAS. While I am sympathetic to
this concern, I am more sympathetic
to the concerns of the undergrad-
uate population. Besides, in the
long run CAS would probably
beneﬁt since the students who
would remain (a sizable proportion,
I would guess) would tend to be
more interested and dedicated.

I am not arguing against the
traditional liberal arts education. It
has its place for those who want it. I
am simply arguing that the
university must adapt itself to the
needs and interests of the student

- body. None of the reasons posited
against a business college are
particularly compelling and the
matter should be, at the least,
debated seriously. As a state
institution, Ifeel that the University
has this obligation.

Demon Bureaucracy’s Agents

-yeomen, we live, reproduce and die
in an atmosphere increasingly
organized, increasingly structured.

The code-word for the fears of so
many people in this country is the

' demon bureaucracy. The sensitive
Right and the sensitive Left both
wish to destroy it. The moderates
on either fringe puzzle over why it
all seems so, well, so damn
inhuman sometimes, so unwork-
able. .

Our politicians and public ﬁgures

_ still bow and scrape at the battered
idols (of individuality, pausing only
to ﬁll out the necessary forms to

“keep things running.”

In this country we pride ourselves
on our individuality. Conservatives
note with a gleam in their eyes that
“If those goddam radicals weren’t
in America they’d all be hung by
now.” P

The truth of the matter is that
organizations, and the terrible
bureaucracy we hate so I deeply
(though we may draw a paycheck
from one or two of them), are
necessary to “keep
running.”

A man of sense and sensitivity .

graduated from Pitt about a year
ago. While here at school he joined
the rest in the ridicule and hatred of_
the “system”, of “the bureau-
cracy”.

He now works for the Social
Security system, with all the
trappings of a highly developed,
civilized bureaucracy. A

‘‘It stinks, in a way,” he said,
referring to the 12 four-inch thick
binders he must consult in his job,
“but I can’t ﬁgure out how it could
be done any other way.”»

And that is the terrible truth. We
are trapped, all of us. In order to
live the lives we like, with the
trappings we enjoy and the services
we count on, we need highly
developed systems, powerful and
immortal bureaucracies.

In fact, it is inescapable. The
Russian Revolution, while deposing
the Tsar, demolished one of the
great proto-types of national
bureaucracies (primitive by post-
computer standards) of mankind at
the time. ,

Yet with all of the destruction,
and all of the anarchy, it was found
necessary to develop another

things‘

SOGAL SECURI

system, as efﬁcient and as ruthless
and as expert as the one destroyed.

In China, Mao tried to avoid this
evolution towards bureaucracy with
.a doctrine of continual revolution
and overthrow.

Well, Mac is dead and the system
goes on. As perhaps one of the most
powerful individuals since history
began, even Mao Tse Tung bowed
before the inevitable necessity of a
bureaucracy. A system. An
organization.

It may be said that, after all,
individuals make the organization:

Unfortunately, the human beings
filling the positions of the
bureaucracy are exactly the most
replaceable parts.

The Roman Catholic Church as an
organization has survived millions
of individuals, hundreds of des-
pots, hundreds of wars..

Frankly, what we dealiwith now in
bureaucracies is just a shadow of
what lies before us. As raw
materials become scarce and the
number of demands increases, the
need for better, more far-reaching,
more complete and efﬁcient organ-
izations will emerge.

We are living in the age of the
Bureaucracy. Wistful glances
backwards can only assuage the

pain of an ego in the process of
being digested. Ronald Regan for
all of his militant demands for an
end to the bureaucracy-would have

i been doomed to failure.

Can you imagine the kind of
organization it would take to destroy
the federal bureaucracy? _

If indeed this is a twilight of

individualism, there might be little’

reason to regret the passing. Our
society now rests on a foundation of
organization so total and so
pervasive that to reject it would be
disaster.

There can be no doubt that
dinosaurs regretted the passing of
their age. ‘

We can console ourselves with
eccentricity of garb, speech,
musical taste and even « political
preferences.

We can even refuse to let the
University use our social security
number.

So long as you don’t make the
mistake of dreaming that you are an
individual.

EATU RES , etc.       

And All were Drunk

BY DAN MULHOLLAND

The following is an autobio-
graphical, but unfortunately all-too
true account ‘of certain events
which transpired this past week-
end. They are presented in the
best chronological order that my
now-muddled memory can man-
age. Only the names have been
changed to protect the innocent
(and guilty).

December 31, 9 p.m.: I am now
en route to that most curious of
modern rituals, the New Year’s
Eve party, army to the teeth with a

‘panoply of devices to aid in the

revelry. Included in this year's bag
of tricks are one genuine Irish tin
whistle for noisemaking; one
digital watch which has just been
set to the ofﬁcial National Bureau
of Standards time; and, last but not

least, one pint of vodka “just in
case the ﬁfth I’m to split with my
friend runs low."

9:30 p.m.: We arrive at the
party, but much to my chagrin. I
discover that my friend and the
ﬁfth have yet to appear. That just
means that, I’ll have to delve into‘
the pint sooner thanseanticipated.

But wait, he was supposed to bring

the pop too, so I am forced to
scrounge for mixers like a wretched
cur. “What? all you have is
orange—pineapple-cranberry juice!”

Oh, well. Beggars Can’t be
ichoosers.
10:45 p.m.: My friend ﬁnally

shows up, and none too soon. I
have already ﬁnished the better
part of my private stock and it is not
sitting too well with the conglom-
eration of juices, lemonade and
mint gingerale that I have been
using to ﬂavor the vodka. But what
does he produce from his bag?
Nothing other than a new brand of
grape soda which he claims will
produce “the drink of the
century!” Yes, but of what

century? Never mind; the situation
A can be remedied. by simply adding
more vodka. ~

 

11:59 p.m.:
and no more bicentennial. The
party is now coalescing around the
living room TV, counting down
with Guy Lombardo. “Wait!” I
yell, “He’s one second too fast!
My ofﬁcial National Bureau of
Standards watch proves it.” "lo
which several voices respond, “But
that’s Guy Lombardo, and he can't
be wrong!" Faced with such
irrefutable logic-, how can I

- disagree? -

12 midnight: Huzzah‘! Toot!
Wheee! 1977 has ﬁnally arrived!
And so has the best part of the

b party; a chance to kiss all the pretty
girls. However, as I begin to make

the circuit around the room, it
becomes apparaent that my hand is.
not as steady as it once was, and

the purple liquid in my glass is

beginning to slosh out. Rather
than. risk touching off an ugly
brouhaha, I wisely set the cup
under the TV.

Much to my dismay, when I
return I ﬁnd it on its side, with the
ﬂoor beneath it somewhat darker
and moister than it was before. “It
wasn’t me.” I quickly say, and
stumble off to reﬁll my glass.

12:45 a.m.: At this point, the
vodka is doing all the talking.

- Right now it's trying to explain the

more esoteric qualities of the tin
whistle to the young ladies on
either side of me. The one on my
right says that she is familiar with
the instrument and proceeds to
embarass me by playing an actual
tune. All I had been able to render
were a few shrill wheezings.

Ithen turn to the one on my left
in the hope of rebuilding my
shattered ego, butmy eyes are
having some difﬁculty in locating
her. Wait. There she is. Imumble
something incoiherently. She looks
back for a moment then replies
with a slight hint of disgust: “Dan,
I’ve never seen you this drunk
before!” To be sure m’dear, and
I’ve never seen this many of you
before either.

brains out to get that almighty “A.”
Take it from a cat (I mean dog) with experience.

chorus of goodbyes and happy new

I am informed that there is more

It’s Panther Trivia Time

BY KAREN KADILAK '

so you think you know all there
is to know about Pitt football, do ya?
Well, whether you do or not, here’s
a quickie quiz about the 1977 Sugar
Bowl champions, the Pitt Panthers,
to test you football knowledge.‘
Good luck. And happy fact-ﬁnding!

1) Any Pitt football fan worth his
Sugar Bowl bragging rights knows
that Tony Dorsett is called
“Hawk.” But T.D. wasn’t the only
Pitt gridder to have a‘nickname.

Can you identify the Pitt offensive
tackles who were known as
“Poonjab” and “Moon?”
subject ‘of
nicknames, if you can recall, several
years back, Miami Dolphin team;
mates Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick
were known as “Butch Cassidy”
and “The Sundance Kid.”

The name caught on with the Pitt
squad, too. Two Pitt players,
off-the-ﬁeld buddies, too, very
much like Csonka and Kiick were,

were also named after the two 1

movie characters. Can you name
the Pitt gridders? 5

3) This sophomore, listed as a
back-up to J effy Delaney at monster
back on the pre-season depth chart,
was a surprise replacement’ for
starting left defensive end Ed
Wilamowski in the Penn State
game. Who was he?

4) Any follower of Pitt football
knows that Johnny Majors was head
coach this past season. However, it
takes a football connoisseur to

identify'the’Pitt assistant coaches-—

the “behind-the-scenes” guys on
_any football team——who helped lead
the Panthers to the national title.
Consider yourself an astute Pitt
gridiron buff? Then match the
names of the coaches with the
position each coached:

Joe Madden quarterbacks/ receivers

Joe Avezzano defensive ends

assistant head coach/
Bobby R0133? defensive backs

Bi“ COX offensive backs

Larry H01teT1'defensive line
Jim DY31’ defensive coordinator

Harry -101168 offensive line

Bob Mate)’ middle guards

‘I to Pitt football.

5) Recently hired as the new head ~

coach, Jackie Sherrill is no new face
For that matter,
neither is he a novice at the head
coach position.

Last year, Sherrill was the head
man at a PAC-8 school. Can you
identify the school?

6) tony Dorsett broke 15 NCAA
records and tied three others during
his illuminous career at Pitt. Two of
those records-—-most points scored
and most touchdowns scored-
respectively broken and tied ‘by
T.D. were previously racked up by a
former Army great.

Panthers—27  
Georgia-3

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

NEW ORLEANS—-Forty years
is a long, long time to wait for a
championship--just ask the Pitts-
burgh Steelers. But it’s worth it.
You stand there perplexed, goose
bumps blanketing your body, and
you don’t know whether to laugh or
cry from the feeling of satisfaction.
That feeling was very evident
after Pitt’s convincing 27-3 win
over the Georgia Bulldogs in last
Saturday's Sugar Bowl to give the
Panthers their first national cham-
pionship since the great Jock

Sutherland team turned the trick‘

way back in 1937.
When the barrage of fans

' stormed the Superdome turf as the

ﬁnal gun sounded, many jumped
up and down with joy, others
reﬂected ontthe 1-9 and 1-10 years
of the recent dismal past. It took
four years to complete one of the
greatest turnarounds in sports--the
electrifying runs of a once
“scrawny" hometown youth
named Tony Dorsett, the wisdom of
Johnny Majors, who came to do a
job and then quietly bowed out to
return home to Tennessee; and the
overall performance of a veteran
team that grew together and beat
the odds to shoot from the very
bottom‘ to the Mt. Olympus of
college football.

The Pitt players knew they were
the best, asthey had displayed on

the field all season long in racking

up 11 straight wins, but the
skeptics needed more proof--saying
the Panthersgbreezed through an
easy schedule. Well, the “Junk-
yard Dogs." the best of the South-
eastern Conference and host team
of the Sugar Bowl, brought along a
10-1 record to provide that awaited
competition. And they did no
better than anyone else.

Not only did the Panthers
dominate offensively, blasting the
Bulldogs in total yards, 480-181,
but they also turned on a thieving

,defense which pulled down four

Georgia aerials (all in the second,
quarter) and fell on two fumbles to
end any threats Pitt's 12th victim
had ideas ofmaking. It was the Pitt
front line of middle guard Al
Romano, tackles Randy Holloway
and Don Parrish, and ends Cecil
Johnson and Ed Wilamowski which
thwarted the Georgia runnin.g
game and set up the interceptions
by linebackers Arnie Weathering-
ton and Jimbo Cramer, and
defensive backs LeRoy Felder and
Bob Jury.

On the other side of the ball
there was Dorsett and his Sugar
Bowl record 202 yards, which.was
expected of him anyhow, and Most
Valuable Player Matt Cavanaugh.
who completed ten of 18 passes for
192 yards. including a 59-yarder to
Gordon Jones in the second quarter
of the 43rd annual affair.

“My hat is off to Pittsburgh,"
said losing coach Vince Dooley,
who sported a hairpiece the week

prior to the game to cover his
shaved head. “They proved they
are the best defensive team we've
seen--I think that's obvious: They
are also the best offensive team
we've faced. They can do so many
things--throw with Cavanaugh.
they have great‘ receivers, and of

   

course, what can you say about
Dorsett. They have no weak-

nesses."
The game came down to
strategy. The “Junkyard Dog"

defense came out playing very
aggressively with a stunting crew
that limited Dorsett to only 65
yards in 17 first-half carries.
Meanwhile, Cavanaugh was put-
ting the ball up in the air and doing
very well at that. So in the second
half, with Georgia leery of
Cavanaugh’s aerials, Dorsett
escaped for the bulk of his 202
yards.

“Our game plan was to get the
ball to Tony Dorsett as much as we
could," Majors said. “It opens up
the passing. We would have liked
to have gone to it more. They were
aggressive and we just thought we
would have to throw the ball more
often on them.”

And that’s exactly what the
Panthers did, building a 21-0 lead
before Georgia completed its first

aerial in the second quarter.

Bulldog quarterbacks Ray Goff
(two-for-15) and Matt Robinson
(one-for-four) completed only three
tosses between them, while the
usually powerful Georgia running
game also stalled against’ the
swarming Pitt defense. The
Panthers outpassed Georgia,
192-46. and outrushed them.
288-135.

It took Pitt only 5:44 to break the
ice and hush the vocal Georgia
cheering section that composed the
greater part of the 76,117 (a new
Sugar .Bowl record for the

Superdome) persons in attendance.
The Panthers drove 80 yards in 12
plays for the touchdown, mixing
pitches to Dorsett and pin-point
passes by Cavanaugh.

Pitt’s No. 1 Status Still
  Hayes-y In Some Eyes

:

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports'Editor

NEW ORLEANS—-Well, the
Associated Press and United Press
International, those so-called wiz-
zards of football expertise, polled
the Pitt Panthers as the number one
collegiate football team in the land,
but others (namely Southern Cal
and Woody Hayes, for several
examples) still doubt their claim to
the national championship.

“They’re making a claim,’ said
Tony Dorsett, wearing a’ pair of
Tennessee-orange boxer shorts
after the game in the Pitt locker
room at the Superdome, about the
skeptics from Los Angeles and

9

Columbus. “But I think we claimed '

it.”

“All year long I haven’t waved
my finger up in the air and I haven’t
worn a number one button,” said
Johnny Majors. “But after the
game Itold the team it was number

‘one and they all agree that we are.’ ’V
Michigan 7

Before the game,
Coach Bo Schembechler said he
could not imagine Pitt beating
Southern ' Cal, the Rose Bowl
opponent to whom the Wolverines
lost, ' 14-6, following the Panther
victory. »

“I can’t imagine him sayingthat
statement,” Majors said. “I don’t
want to start a vendetta, but I
appreciate what other people do in
other parts of the country. I’ve had
my butt kicked as a coach in
different parts of the country and I
respect the fact that there are great
teams all over the country.

“This team never backed away

from anybody,” Majors continued, ‘
emphasizing that Georgia was the .

best available team the Panthers
could play in post-season competil
tion. “We didn't go somewhere for
money. We just went so we could
play for the national champion-
ship.”

Many of the Pitt players and
coaches were bothered by the
remarks made by Hayes that the
Panthers were afraid to face Big
Eight champion Colorado in the
Orange Bowl. ‘

When questioned of his feelings
about the national championship,
Randy Reutershan affirmed, “In-

credible. I don’t think we really

realized what we did yet. We
worked four years for this, there
should be no doubt now. Tell thatfto
Woody Hayes and the rest of them.

“Georgia’s alumni and fans won‘
the game for us. They were so

talking, but we shut them up.”

    Ga. Fans Hoarselmeat)

BY RON SIEGEL

NEW ORLEANS--The chant bv
the jubilant Pitt fans in the Marriott
Hotel summed it best: “Goodbye
Bulldogs, Goodbye Bulldogs, Good-
bye Bulldogs, It’s time to shut your
mouths.” -

Though Pitt was clearly the better
football team, the abuse heaped,
upon the Pitt players (and fans) all
week was the_ biggest motivator of
the Panthers, even more so than the
national championship that they
wrapped ~ up by trouncing the
Bulldogs, 27-3.

“We showed the Georgia fans
who was the dogfood,” said
Heisman Trophy winner Tony
Dorsett, who set a Sugar Bowl
record by rushing for 202 yards,
Dorsett missed out on most valuable
player award by one-and-a-half
votes, losing to teammate Matt
Cavanaugh. ‘

‘‘I found them a’ little
obnoxious, ’ ’ said, Cavanaugh. ‘ ‘I’ll
get even with them tonight (on

Bourbon Street after the game).
Our fans are behind us, but ‘not like

- this.”

Most of the chants the Pitt
players endured all week are
unprintable, but one of the kinder
ones was “Dawgfood, Dawgfood.”

“We like to do our talking on the
field,” said center John Pelusi, who
wore a Georgia button all week to

help resist the temptation to belt,

somebody. “We didn’t hear any of
the ‘dogfood’ stuff out on the field. ’ ’
‘‘I thought I was playing the fans
instead of their team, ’ ’ said reserve
running back Thom Sindewald.
Carson Long, who booted two
ﬁeld goals and three extra points,
said, “Georgia fans are obnoxious.
They’re the worst fans I've seen in
my life. They had me so mad. All I

heard was ‘Dogfood, Dogfood’. All
week we put up with that horse----.
The stadium got mighty quiet,
though.” » «

Though Pitt fans were outnum-
bered by about ﬁve to one, they
quickly became the more vocal as
the Panthers racked up points on
the scoreboard.

“All I wanted to see was the pom-
poms stop waving in theistands,”
said Dave DiCiccio, who missed the
game because of a torn ligamentin
his ankle. “None of us said
anything all week.”

Despite the fuss about Pitt’s lack
of curfews, the shaven “Junkyard
Dogs” and their vociferous fans
were no matchifor the number-one
Pitt Panthers. 1

Reserve defensive back Larry
Felton composed half of a poem that
is begging forlan ending. It is a
message to4Georgia Coach Vince
Dooley. 4

‘‘You shaved your heads, and you
went to bed,” said Felton.

It’s only half of a poem, but it
showed that curfews and crewcuts
don’t win football games. - 1

Sorry Bo, But’Pitt ls
  The National Champion

( Continued from Page I‘)

‘‘I hope there isn’t any doubt,”
said defensive tackle Randy Hol-
loway, “because if there is, there’s
a lot of silly people out there-like
on the west coast and in the Big Ten.
Michigan lost to Purdue and they
shouldn’t say a thing.” *

“No, no, there’s not doubt,” said
a happy Coach Joe Madden. “Do
you think so? Pitt played the
highest-ranked team it could
possibly play. I, don’t care what
those guys (Hayes and others)
say.” ‘

“There won’t be any doubt
around‘ here,” said Sugar Bowl
MVP Matt Cavanaugh. “I don’t

know what the people on ‘Grand-
stand’ are going to say. But we
don’t even care ‘what they say.”

‘ ‘Grandstand, ’ ’ if you remember,
pushed USC’s Ricky Bell for the
Heisman Trophy, before he was
injured and passed up by Dorsett,
and polled the Trojans, UCLA and

Michigan for the number one spot
all season long because it is the
Rose Bowl network. But Sunday,

the not-too-smart folks there

begrudgingly conceded the national
title to Pitt as the wire services
would do a day later.

“We just went out there and
showed them 12 weeks in a row,”
middle guard Al Romano said as
proof enough, while his colorful
father said with joy, “This is

something you ’go through once in a .

lifetime, once in a lifetime.’’ -

“People know who Pitt is now,”
said guard Tom Brzoza. “We’re
here to stay.”

“Good. Great. Fabulous. Fantas-
tic. Wonderful.” Those were the
adjectives used by split end Willie
Taylor in describing how he felt
about being national champs. “If
there’s any doubt out there, they're
crazy—-something’s got to be wrong
with them.” .

Well—Woody, Bo and “Grand-
stand”-—'what do you say now?

“Tiger” Paul—Pitt’s
7 Most Dedicated Fan

BY CRIS HALL

NEW ORLEANS—More than 12,000 Pittsburghers made the trip
South for the Sugar Bowl, many of them Pitt people. Some were there to
win a national championship, most were to ‘watch them do it. But one
was there just to cheer.

“Tiger” Paul Auslander, Pitt’s unofficial cheerleader, has spent the
last several years leading Pitt students in cheers when not supporting
himself by servicing a massive newspaper route. As you might imagine,
he was more excited about Pitt’s drive for number one than one
Pittsburgh sportswriter (not this one) is about the prospect of observing

Phyllis George in the shower.

~ But if your living is made selling newspapers, how do you go about
affording a trip to a tourist trap like Sugar Bowl-week New Orleans.

Christmas tips.

‘ ‘It was after the Penn State game that I decided to come down here, ”

Auslander said. “I had to. . .it’s expensive, for just being here two days,
but it’s worth it tome because Pitt . * ‘ ~ —  . .

had the chance to be number one.
I’ve been excited for a month.

“I signed up for the trip four or i=1:

five weeks ago because I knew I

would receive enough to pay for the .
trip. I needed $329, but it turned ' "

out I‘got more than $400 from my
customers—140 daily and 200
Sunday.

“I couldn’t have made it here. 0

without them,” he said. “They’re
all great people and they helped me
get down here, so I am looking
forward to doing some cheering at
the Superdome,” Auslander said
before the game. “I don’t think
they’ll let me out on the field, but if
they do, or if I can find a place where
the Pitt fans can see me. I’ll be
cheering for the Panthers.”

As it turned out, a Pitt official did
bar “Tiger” from the Superdome
field. But that didn’t stop Paul.
First, he tried to buy a first-row seat
from a fan, but that didn’t work, so

' he contended himself with a spot in

an aisle close to the ﬁeld. And
proceeded to cheer away.

One place Paul did his cheerlead-
ing center-stage was, of all places,
Bourbon Street.

“I was walking down Bourbon
Street,” he said, “just looking
around, when all these people I
didn’t even know came up to me and
said hello. Theytrecognized me,
even in the middle of Bourbon
Street, and that really made me feel
good. Meeting people like that is
one of the greatest pleasures I have.,?.

“Anyway, I said hello to all of
them ,_ and then we did a cheer, right
in the middle of Bourbon Street.

sight, especially for the inebriated
Georgia “Bull-Dawg” fans. The
Tiger, in full battle array screaming
“Let’s go Pitt,” arms ﬂailing wildly
at 3 a.m. ~

“Tiger, ’ ’ perhaps the personbest
prepared to take on vociferous
Georgia folk, had a good story about
one Pitt coach who wasn’t so ready
to yell it out for the national
championship.

“Jim’D‘yar (Pitt’s defensive line
coach) told me a couple of days ago
that he’d rather try to outyell
Georgia than play them,” uslander
said. “But now, after seeing all
their fans, and how loud they are, he
says he’d rather just play them
instead. .

‘ ‘He told me, ‘Everybody who
voted for Jimmy Carter in the entire
state of Georgia seems to be here.’

As “Tiger” told the story, a
group of Pitt fans wandered past
and a chorus of “Hiya, Tiger
Paul’s” ﬁlled the Marriott Hotel
lobby. ' ‘a
“You know,” said “Tiger,” I
really love it when people come up
to me like that. That really means a
lot to me.”

Then it was time for “Tiger” to
go. “You know,” said this man,
who lives on a $65-a-week paper
route and whose greatest joy is
cheering for a school whose
administration considers him an
annoyance, .“I’m really very
lucky.”

Pitt and Pitt fans are very lucky to
have a number-one fan like Paul
Auslander.

Dog Fans Bark Abuse

BY RON SIEGEL

NEW ORLEANS--Though they
enjoyed a higher ranking going into
the Sugar Bowl, and though the
ticket allotment to each team was
the same, the Pitt Panthers were
clearly outnumbered on Bourbon
Street, the center of attention in the
jazz capital of the world.

Walking down Bourbon Street
wearing a Pitt hat or button resulted
in an avalanche of abuse from the
more numerous and more vocal
Georgia fans, who just don’t seem
to mindxbeing called “dogs.”

“Dogfood, Dogfood,” the Geor-
gia partisans would shout, and
there wasn’t much a Pitt fan could
say without bringing himself down
to that level.

A response of “You’ll choke on
it”, or “You’ll have to catch it
first,” .was demeaning to Pitt.

There was one response that
generally silenced supporters
wearing red and black. The
Junkyard Dogs lost their only game
of the regular season to Mississippi,
21-17. A cry of “Ole Miss” usually
left them speechless. Y

Bulldog fans were not especially
clever. "One Bourbon Streeter,
when confronted by the response,
‘ ‘Mississippi, ’ ’ replied, ‘ ‘We didn’t
play Mississippi.” Itwas obvious
that many Georgians just don’t
know that Mississippi and Ole Miss
are one and the same.

Bulldog fans were creative. One
was playing the “Tennessee
Waltz” on the elevator of the
Marriott Hotel, headquarters for
the Panthers. ,

Pitt fans always managed to come
up with a clever response. Though
many didn’t know what the
.“Tennessee Waltz” was named,
one that found out responded to a
startled Georgia fan, “I haven't

   

It was a wil Sa on o reet as ugar Bol MVP Matt

heard of any school that was after
Vince Dooley for its head coach.”

One of the more unusual sights on
Bourbon Street, aside from the
numerous nude dancers and female
impersonators, was the Georgia

 

     

mascot, “Uga", a horrendous

looking bulldog.

In response to that, Pitt Golden
Panther Denny Palmer came up
with a plastic lobster on a leash,
which he labled, “Leroy Brown,
badder than a junkyard dog!”

A tavern renamed the “Pitt Panther Inn” and sidewalk jazz dancers
were just a couple of the highlights of Bourbon Street in New Orleans.

Unique New Orleans Just
As Sweet As Sugar Bow

BY MARIA SCIULLO

NEW ORLEANS—Somehow, a
bowl game in Miami just wouldn’t
have been the same.

Pitt fans who made the trip to
New Orleansfound the city to be
almost as big an attraction asithe
Sugar Bowl itself. Famous for its
French Quarter, Creole cooking
Bourbon Street and, of course, the
Superdome; the Crescent City
provided visitors from Georgia and

Pittsburgh with a variety of things i

to do and see.

Dining out included French and
seafood cuisine at such restaurants
as Brennan’s a the Court of the

Georgia earlier in the day to capture the national title.

While the Panthers were running their record to 12-0 in New Orleans,
the Pitt basketball team was running its record to 2-8 in new Mexico.
With games against such teams as Notre Dame, Maryland, Syracuse
and Cincinnati remaining, it’s becoming a possibility that Pitt’s football
team could amass more victories in 12 starts than the basketball squad
will take 28.

Not helping matters is Wayne Williams’ current case of bruised ribs,
which leaves him “questionable” for tonight’s game with the
Mountaineers. ‘ ‘If he does play, ’ ’ said a Pitt spokesman, ‘ ‘he’ll only see
limited action.”

Ed‘ Scheuermann, recovering from a bout with the ﬂu, practiced
yesterday, as did Williams, who wore protective padding and had to stop
for occational adjustments.

Meanwhile, Sonny Lewis and Mike Rice continue to improve at a

. heartening rate. sonny could be the point guard Tim Grgurich is looking

for, but that move could be a temendous waste of talent. Watching
Sonny convert alley-oop plays makes one realize Sonny Lewis is a man
born to tuck ally-oop passes into the net. That and score 20 points a

Christ (and Pryor) Coming?

Back in the football scene, word from a Pitt recruiter is that the
Panthers have two local high school standouts “in the bag.” One is
Benjy Pryor the only Pennsylvanian on this season’s Parade
All-America team, a defensive lineman from Valley. The other is Penn
Hills wide receiver Mike Christ, an all-WPIAL performer who was
named Class AAA MVP by the Post-Gazette.

And, still speaking of football, there’s additional hope for next season
in the predictions of Coach Jackie Sherrill and split end Gordon Jones
that the passing display put on in the Superdome will continue ‘ ‘allnext
year.”

With Jones and Matt Cavanaugh, Pitt will have the best passing
combination in the country and both players appear headed for
post-season honors next season. There’s also a good chance Sherrill will
enter the 1977 season well-.armed—with a shotgun. ‘The Panthers
practiced out of the shotgun in Pittsburgh and new Orleans, and would

Two Sisters. Cafe Maison features
Beignet doughnuts‘ and coffee,
while Tortoricci’s specializes in
Italian food. .

Bourbon, Royal and Canal Streets
were the settings for much of the
New Year and Sugar Bowl
celebrations. Al Hirt and Pete
Fountain were two big jazz names
appearing at their -own clubs. Pat
O’Brien’s was yet another popular
night spot. Some of the more
risque establishments such as the
Gunga Den and Hotsy Totsy
attracted tourists with their strip
and female impersonation shows.

_ Besides the usual assortment of
souvenir stores, New Orleans is
crowded with antique shops boast-
ing wares of brass, crystal,
furniture and jewelry. Paintings are
sold on the sidewalks of Jackson
Square, while the drivers of
horse-drawn carriages clamor for
customers.

The Pitt-Georgia football game
wasn’t the only Sugar Bowl sporting
event. The University of Cincinnati
defeated last year’s national
champion, Indiana, in the ﬁnals of
the basketball classic. Georgia and
South Carolina also took part in the
tournament, which was playe_d in
the Superdome. A tennis tourna-
ment and sailing regatta also took
place.

Perhaps the most memorable
impression of New OR-leans, as
the natives pronounce it, was not of
the city itself, but of the
atmosphere created by many
over-enthusiastic Georgians. Clus-
ters of red-cla/d Bulldoggers roamed
the streets as cries of “Go Dawgs"
could be heard in stores, bars and
on hotel elevators. Panther fans,
greatly outnumbered, had to put up
with the bragging for several days.
As expected, however, many of the

Georgians were much quieter by
Saturday afternoon. It seems that
instead of intimidating the Pitt
players, the Bulldog fans served
only to arouse the Panthers’
determination.

Following the game, ‘Georgian
mixed comments of, “You really
whupped us,” “Pitt doesn’t know
how to celebrate,” and “We’l1 be
back next year, but y'all might not”
faded into the fog surrounding the
river city on Sunday as, bit by bit,
the fun and excitement of the 43rd

Elvis Is Still Rock's King

BY DEANNA LOUISE

“It’s New Year’s Eve, the last night .

of this tour. I’ve already played an
hour and ﬁve minutes. But I’ll
play all night if you want me to.”
Women, gasped and a ripple of
excitement flowed through the Civic
Arena sell-out crowd. It was 12:30
a.m. New Year’s Day and the king
of rock and roll stood thinner than

‘_he’s been in a year (but not quite so

thin as housewives’ fantasies would
have him), hardly able to get out the

words while trying to sip warm
water and speak at the same time,
and hardly able to dodge the bolt of
applause that lit smiles of pride and
recognition on the faces of the Las
Vegas Hilton Band members and
Presley’s backup singers.

Presley was no swivel-hipped

youngster in silky Hawaiian shirt

and too-tight pants that night.
though his hair was still jet black
and his age stole no snatches of

--youthful southern charm.

’ The ladies, who once in their
preteens swooned at the gates of
Graceland, his Tennessee home,
were there, yelling and groping for

after another into the audience,

, with no few police ofﬁcers’ toes

being trampled in the process.

He sang some old songs, “Little
Sister,” "Jailhouse Rock,”
“Hound Dog,” “Now or Never”

Mio”), “Blue Suede Shoes,” and

more with a little bump and even
less of the grind suggestive of his
ﬁfties gyrations, once considered so
lewd that Ed Sullivan would televise
him only from the waist up.

What the maturity of his act
shunned in excesses it comple-
mented with Presley’s well-
modulated, sensuous voice that
could resonate for eons.

His voice carried with a density
akin to Presley’s virility.

He sang some recent songs,
including his single “Hurt,” a slow
dance song reminiscent of the box
step, Marilyn Monroe high heels
and Saturday night dances (a
legend in their own time). But the

tone of the song was serious and
powerful, bespeaking of a mournful
love.

Presley’s shaky leg, guitar and
other shaky leg stole the show for a
few moments of his hour-and-a-half
performance. But his love songs

were more captivating than any 4'

prop could have been.

The show was classy, mature,
longer than most and representa-g
tive of a musical talent far beyond "
that of the .rebel rouser of the ’50s.

Sad Apes and Reborn Stars in ChrisfmastMovies

BY JIM FARERI

King Kong producer Dino De
Laurentiis reminds me of second-
rate circus ringmaster, trying to
hard sell the public his “Greatest
Show On Earth” but not making
delivery once the money has
changed hands.

His “Hur-ree, Hur-ree,. Hur-
ree” consisted of one of the most
intense publicity campaigns waged
in movie history. From the start,
talk ran high about the movie. The
Ringmaster had let everyone in on
how big, how real, and how
expensive his mechanical Kong
would be. By October the media
‘was excited enough to award King

a Kong the cover of Time, more than

two months before the movie was
released. A

DeLaurentiis has billed his
extravaganza as the “most ori-
ginal” picture ever ﬁlmed; but the
plot is just a modernized version of
the 1933 classic. The only
signiﬁcant change is that the new

‘Kong becomes a victim of man’s
inhumanity and cruelty, but this.

theme is weakly developed and the

element of spectacle is left to drag

the picture past the ﬁnish line.

The publicity poster, released
well before the fact, depicts Kong
stradling the World Trade Towers
in a clash with several jet ﬁghters.
{But in the movie Kong is far too
small to straddle skyscrapers, and
he ﬁghts helicopters, not jets. I felt
sorry for the kidsin the theatre:
the helicopters were like getting
underwear and socks for Christ-
mas.

The kids were also disturbed
with the amount of improbability in
the ﬁlm. Having the audience
accept Kong wasn’t enough for
DeLaurentiis. _ Charles \ Grodin’s
portrayal of the archetypal villian
was more unreal than the monster,
as were Jessica Lange’s antics in
Kong's palm.

The screenplay is poor. Tension,
which made Jaws a hit, is absent in
King Kong. The beast, beauty and
boyfriend love triangle is a small
attempt by DeLaurentiis to sur-
round his star attraction with a

genuine story. Mainly, Kong is left ,

on his own to entertain, and even
he with his million-dollar looks is
insufﬁcient to sustain interest. ,”

Largely unknown to the public is
The Ringmaster's introduction of a
man in an apesuit when the going
got too tough for the mechanical
One wonders how much
difference it would have made if
this procedure had been followed
consistently. V

 

If King Kong proves anything, it
is that spectacle, is strictly a
cinematic device and barely any-
thing in itself. This remake of King
Kong will lend prestige to the
original.

‘BY M.C. PILECKI

It sort of indicates how desperate
Hollywood is for originality when
the two biggest (in budget, that is)
movies of the Christmas season are
remakes.__,of a proven product from
the ’30s.

So, King Kong again stalks New
York,‘ and A Star Is Born. Of

Jesica Lange is about to be given a bath by her co-star in the Din

   
   

that other ov'er-publicized ﬁlms
have been (anyone remember The
Great Ghastly?), but is rather, in
spots, a quite good ﬁlm, if you can
accept is on its own terms. What is
is a Barbara Streisand vehicle,
geared for her talents, and she
doesn’t like strong male co-stars
much.

What the latest Star is not is a
ﬁlm resembling its predecessors in
anything but superﬁcial details.

‘While the others had satirical

undertones on Hollywood life, this
ﬂick has no such similar look at the
rock industry. Sure, the stars
complain about touring, but there's

DeLaurentiis film, King Kong, which also stars J eff Bridges and Charles
Grodin. Playing at the Gateway, King Kong was directed by John

Guillermin.

course, this isn’t the ﬁrst remake‘

for the latter. The hollywood
legend of two stars marrying while
one is on the way up and the other
down has been done in several
different versions, including 1937
and 1954 ﬂicks quite close to the
original story.

Here it comes again.

This time the story has been
transplanted to the world of pop
music. A not unreasonable move.
After all, as far as ﬁlms are
concerned, the “star system” is
quite dead, the studios no longer
wield such power, and actresses
are almost nonexistent, as big
stars, newborn or otherwise. In
rock, however, all those points are
still valid, and the new setting
makes possible a very commerci-
able soundtrack album.

‘One of the problems with
viewing this ﬂick is the heavy,
intensive publicity campaign it’s
been getting since before produc-
tion started more than two years
ago. Anything less than the
Second Coming was going to be a
disappointment.

Still, it's_not the colossal bomb

  
   

I

Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristoff are the romtlc leads i th I

Norman while he preached and
lived the evils of it. Esther this
time is no street urchin, but a very
strong woman not in the least
daunted by having a big-name star
crash up her act.

But this time Esther doesn’t
seem so gung-ho for the star trip.
In fact, John Norman has to
literally pull and puch her--while
still ironically eschewing the ideals
he preaches. If anything, Kris
Kristofferson’s John Norman
Howard seems like a hasbeen
before the movie even starts, and

.his line about not wanting to go on

tour with her because people might
think he's “carrying” her is
inadvertently the funniest in the
ﬂick.

Kristofferson’s part seems to
have been deliberately written
down. Earlier versions of the
story--all vehicles for the female
star--have reserved their most

,memorable parts for the tragic

male hero, slugging too-nosy
photographers and tossing off
biting lines. Well, Kris gets to slug
a lot of people, and even gets to
look sad-eyed and then cry, but all
the good scenes, lines--and even all
the good songs--belong to 'strei-
sand, yet the wisecracking funny
girl.

Still, trying _to understand his
character is more interesting. He
lives in a huge, underfurnished
mansion, peopled with various

Streisand as executive producer.

little insight given on how the Big
Rock Machine functions. It was
that “insider’s” look that kept
earlier Stars from being the simple
melodramatic love story that it was.
Another curious difference is in
the characters of Esther and
Norman'(this time John Norman‘).
Be; fore, Esther was a waif bent on
success, helped along by her

parasites. And (in the film's more
memorable Kristofferson scenes),
he “Forgets" the inane lyrics of an
inane song he's supposedly written
and sung a thousand times, one of
the few examples of the tedium of
the business. The incident leading
to his ﬁnal downfall--a groupie
masquerading as a rock reporter
takes him to bed to get close to his

wife--is one of the good twists from
the earlier versions.

Star concentrates mainly on the
“love/hate” relationship between
Esther and‘John Norman. The
“hate” part is apparent enough,
but one seriously wonders what
they see’ in each other. “W

«P

Particularly, what does she see in ~

,him? He seems attracted by her

spirit and obvious, overwhelming
talent. but her attraction for and
dependence on him is quite
puzzling. .

Finally. what can one say about
Streisand that isn't written in
superlatives already? ' She domin-
ates the ﬁlm from the moment she
makes a dramatic entrance to her
even more dramatic ﬁnish. Her
songs. even the weaker ones, are
terifﬁc. It’s her show, and her fans
have a lot to see.

Another ﬁlm that should be
labeled “for fans only” is The
Seven Per Cent Solution. It’s a
most engrossing film of the
greatest Sherlock Holmes mystery
of them all—-Sherlock Holmes
himself.

For those not acquainted with
Nicholas Meyer's best-selling
pastiche, Solution is the “true
story” of Holmes’ three-year
disappearance when he was pre-
sumed dead, killed by the evil
Professor Moriarty. In this tale,
Dr. Watson enlists the aid of the
not-yet-famous Sigmund Freud to,
cure Holmes of his debilitation
addiction to cocaine (a weakness
‘often referred to in the Arthur
Conan Doyle stories before
Holmes’ disappearance), using
hypnosis, dream analysis, and a
forerunner of psychoanalysis.
Once Holmes goes cold turkey, he

-and Watson are off on another

adventure, this time with the help
of Dr. Freud. _

Therein lies the virtue--and the
drawback--of Solution. It’s no
Hound of the Baskervilles. There's
no stereotyped view of Holmes and
Watson dashing off to solve
another exciting mystery. Rather,
it’s a character study of the single
most well-known ﬁctional character
of them all.

Holmes’ many devotees will
delight in this chance to see him
more as a person, a strong man
suffering to shake off his one great
weakness, drug . addiction. The
Sherlockians and Holmesians of the
world are interested more in
ﬁnding out about the personal life
of the great detective than in
simply another mystery pastiche.

There was no doubt about Pitt’s
first encounter ever with Rockland,
a two-year school which went 31-2
last season (29-0 over two years in
their league) and was 10-5 this
season before the Panthers lowered
them two notches. Hetz scored the
first goal in his hat trick
performance midway through the
opening frame, taking a pass from
Jim Wayne; then Bill Gedeon, who
tallied two goals and six assists in
the three games, followed with a
goal less than a minutelater, set up
by Tim Duffy.

After Rockland got on the board
when a shot from the blueline was
deflected past Pitt goalie Larry
Newill, who stopped 20 shots in the
victory, the Panthers went in front
3-1 in the second period when Hetz
flipped a backhand over the prone
Rockland goalie.

that Pitt almost let escape. After
building leads of 3-0 and 6-2, the
Panthers held off a late Rockland
rally to take their second victory in
a row. '

Hetz and Gedeon scored on ﬁrst"

period breakaways, then Duffy
tipped in a Rick Stein slap shot to
put Pitt way in front. But Rockland
fought back to within a goal in the
ﬁnal minutes of the frame.

Sherwin’s successful 35-foot slap
shot in the second period started
Pitt on a barrage of three
unanswered goals. including tallies
seconds apart in the early moments
of the third period by Stein and
Hetz, to give the Panthers a
commanding 6-2 1 lead with 13
minutes left in the game.

Again Rockland fought back, Bill
Sterns (two goals) and Jerry Elicks
closed the gap to within one, 6-5.
But Gedeon escaped on another
break-away, pulling the bewildered
Rockland goalie to the right, then
flipping the puck to Duffy, who
tucked it in the open left side.

Against the Junior Saints, Newill
again was forced to come up with
some big early saves to keep Pitt

even with the fast-skating ‘and
hard-checking amateurs. After the
Saints drew ﬁrst blood (on the
scoreboard, that is), Sherwin
deadlocked the first period score at
one goal apiece by knocking in his
own rebound.

The Panthers went up 3-1 in the
second frame when defenseman
Russ Stump, playing his last game
for Pitt before leaving for a
work-study program in mining
engineering in’ Wyoming, drilled a
slap shot over the left shoulder of
the Saints’ tested goalie, who faced

.was ground into the ice when a

Rockland player fell'on his head
and the ensuing gash_ required 29
stitches. Sherwin, however, played
out the game, then also reported to
the hospital, but only when the
team went to -pick up Newill.

Freshman goalie Marty Bradley,
who was the victorious netminder
in Pitt’s 7-5 win over Rockland
College, replaced Newill and
blanked the Saints in the second
period, but some bad positioning
by the Pitt defensemen and failures
to clear the puck out of their own
zone allowed the Saints to knot the
game at 3-3 with only three
minutes remaining.

the ﬁrst ten games of the season the

‘Panthers are averaging 34 rebounds 7

rebounding improves, the Cats can
win their share of the upcoming
games.

resulted in the Panthers making 181
trips to the foul line thus far, while
the opposition has been there 273
times, as average of more than nine
more foul shots per contest. This
statistic has been a major contribu-
ting factor in many of the losses.

On the bright side, Harris, Rice, hp

and Lewis are all shooting over 50%.

22.8 points per game to lead the

team and Rice’s rebounding“

average of 8.2‘ is tops in that
department. Lewis is second in
scoring at 12.8 and Rice third at
10.2. No other Panther is in double
