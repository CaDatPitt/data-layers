They've been in it. We hope that their presence here

All ﬁve attended the recent In-
ternational Student Assembly at
Washington—-—at which the inter-
national youth‘ “Credo” (printed

- in the last issue of the Pitt News)
was adopted. Following its adop-
tion the credo was recorded in
every major language and ‘sent ‘to
all parts of the world including
most of occupied Europe.

It was through the assembly that
-many American students met the
war heroes, with such ﬁne results
that International Student Service,
who sponsored the assembly, or-
ganized a tour for the group which
will bring them before every major
student group in the country.

The student committee, selected
by SFA around a nucleus of the
four University students who at-
tended the conference, Aldo Icardi,
C43, Mary Bruce, C43, Richard
Kramer, C42‘/2. and Irwin Rosen,
C43, last Friday told Pitt News re-
porters:

“We invite and urge all Univer-

. sity students to attend tomorrow's
assembly. The message of these
student-heroes is inspiring and
exciting. We who were at the
International Student assembly
feel that students who were not
able to get to the conference
should not miss this chance to re-
ceive first hand information of the

role of the students ﬁghting this 4

W31’.

\“The things that were empha-
sized at the assembly will be re-
affirmed right here on campus, the
same feeling of unity and comity
with students from the Allied Na-
tions, the same free exchange of
ideas between students, the same
recounting of actual war experi-
ences——-all of which proved so stim-
ulating at Washington last month.

Of W ime

By HUGH CHAVERN I
National Newspaper week is be-

ing observed, its third year, in suc-

cession this week, with every pub-

lication in the United States co-

, operating to impress the reading
~ pubhc

with the
in one’s

importance of

newspapers daily life.

- Newspaper week is even more im-

portant this year because it is ac-

" tively combating the subversive

propaganda tactics of the Axis.

In all, two main ideas are car-
ried on throughout Newspaper
week: ﬁrst, that the newspapers
are carrying on an invaluable
service to the American public
by bringing to their homes all
the exact details of the global
war the Allies are ﬁghting; sec-
ond, that the moving force be-
hind all the effort is the advertis-

_ er, without -whose help the news-
.~ papers would be priced too far

above a normal level to allow
the ‘present daily circulation of
newsprint among so many per-
sons.

American newspapers are ﬁght-
ing the Axis eifort in a way that
publishers term “a secret weapon,”
in that the inﬂuence wielded by
newspapers is not apparent be-
cause of, its steady, daily effect
upon the public. Americans take
the newspaper for granted, not re-
alizing that it shapes all their
ideas, thoughts, and actions.

The newspaper has become the
prime source of all campaigns
which are necessary to support of
the war effort. Newspapers are
“active in the battle to win.” As
a free, American voice, represent-
ing thousands of people, it is a go-

-Lunt and Fontonne
Present ‘The Pirate’

To the Nixon this week has come
the newest. Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fon-
tanne vehicle, “The Pirate.” Labeled
a comedy with music, the play is set
in the West Indies early in the
19th ‘century.

Into the small village has come
a buccaneer, now rich enough to
go straight, who carefully buries
his past and marries the village
belle, in the person of Miss Fon-
tanne, of course.

The glamourousﬂy in this happy
ointment is Mr. Lunt who simul-
taneously discovers he is in love
with Miss Fontanne and that her
husband is not the good boy he
pretends to be. For those weary of
war and of plays with “messages”
“The Pirate” is on the must-see
list.

the people, and for the advertisers
and the people. American news-
papers bring the Vital facts to the
public, and bring them fast. Cen-

entire nation an invaluable service.

Newspaper week this year has
had a new and vital meaning,

Youth Hold
Free India

Demonstration

Celebrating the birthday of Ma-
hatma Gandhi, a group of Pitts-
burgh youth held a Free India
Now demonstration in the triangle
last Friday night.

Bearing posters calling for the
President to offer his services as
mediator for a free‘ India now,
the marchers wore white Gandhi
caps as a symbol of identification
with the Indians in their strug-
gle for freedom.

Other posters carried quotations
by Gandhi, Senator Reynolds, Pearl
Buck, and A. Philip Randolph tes-
tifying strongly in favor of In-
dian freedom now. "

One of the quotations, by
Gandhi, read: “I want India to
oppose Japan to a man. If she
were free she would do so.”

The group plans to continue its
activities in the interests of Indian
freedom, and cordially invites the
participation of all interested in-
dividuals. (For information write

Coach Charley Bowser’s Golden Panthers apparently
didn’t read their scripts too well last Saturday after-
noon in which they were to be easy victims of the famed
~ "aerial circus from Southern Methodist University. The cyni-
fcal critics throughout the country showed no hopes for the
 locals. They foresaw another crushing defeat, and went on
; ‘to say that the Panthers were not capable and hadn’t any
. ﬁght in them.
_ Instead, last weekend, they played sound, heads-up foot-
ball-—the type of ball that they are capable of doing-——for

ltheentire four quarters, while the Texans, inclined to be a i

_ mite prodigal, had to be quite content with their lone tally.
- It was a glorious victory for both the fans and for the Blue

T and Gold team. The followers wondered whether they could
‘_ spring back from their previous humiliating defeat and
 record a successful season. The team knew they could for
:,.they had the determination to do so, and, last Saturday
A ' afternoon, they did.

_. . _It was a rather common remark "after" the game to say,

f‘Why didn’t Pitt take this ball team up to Minnesota”? But
A‘ -git"s true they did. Although it was exactly the same players, it
, {Was a ‘young inexperienced team not yet ready for that type
_ “of competition. They needed experience. They received it at

3Minnesota, and it paid dividends against the Mustangs.

This Saturday Bowser takes his squad to Cleveland,
‘Ohio, for a battle with the once-beaten Great Lakes Naval
Training Station team. With their abundance of all-Ameri-
cans and professionals, Pitt will, undoubtedly, onceiagain be
‘the underdogs. That is how. it should be for the locals do not
have the manpower and reserves to cope with them.‘There-
"fore, on paper, Pitt should lose.

But the Great Lakes team is deﬁnitely not invincible.
. ”:Michigan showed that when they toppled them, 9-0. Pitt, with
 win already under their belts, should be tough. Their line
‘\'_i;_s steadily improving, the backﬁeld is only a little short of
brilliant, and their courage and determination is remarkable.

 ,, The whole story will lie in reserves. Coach Bowser cannot
lldraw too deeply from his substitutes, and against men such
, -[as Bruce Smith, Bob Sweiger, Pete Kmetovic, Urban Odson,
island Rudy Mucha, reserve players tospell off the worn, tired
ll regulars are a prerequisite. Regardless, it will be a ﬁne game.

Having regained some of their
lost prestige with a decisive 20-7
win over Southern Methodist last
Saturday, Pitt’s Golden Panthers
travel up to Cleveland this week-
end on another “suicide” assign-
ment when they meet the Great

Lakes Naval Training Station
team.
This game is probably the

toughest contest remaining on the
Panther’s schedule for the service
outﬁt is overloaded with standout
grid material. From last season's
national championship Minnesota
team coach Lt. Paul Hinkle has
backs. Sweiger and Bruce Smith
and guard Len Levy.

Add to these three stars such for-
mer all-Arnericans and former pro-
fessional aces as Ohio State’s Jim
Daniell and Gust Zarnas, Carl Mul-
leneaux from the Green Bay Pack-
ers, Pete Kmetovic, Standford’s
great back and Washington’s Rudy
Mucha, and you have another head-
ache for the Bowsermen.

In the two games they have
played thus far this season Great
Lakes has lost to Michigan 9-0 in
a game which was termed an “up-
set” and then came back last Satur-
day to wallop Iowa, 25-0. Thus, in
the won and lost column the Pan-
thers are even with Gobs, but that’s
as far as it goes.

Lt. Hinkle has two full teams
which he uses alternately through-
out a game. His so-called ﬁrst
team or starting eleven has Carl
Mulleneaux and Nebraska‘s Fred
Preston at the ends, Jim Daniell

and Jim Barber, former San Fran- ‘.

cisco stalwart, holding down the
tackles, Bill Ratlovich from U.S.C.

and Baylor’s Bob Nelson at center.
When this array of stellar line-
men show signs of tiring or just
feel like sitting out a few plays
Hinkle sends in his “second” team
line. On this “scrub” eleven are
Urban Odson and Len Levy, both
former stars for the Gophers, and
Bob Johnson, who played center for
Purdue during his undergrad days.

Now we come to the power part
of the team, the backﬁeld. Here the
Gobs really have a choice of stand-
out material. The “ﬁrst” team
backs are Rudy Mucha, Bruce
Smith, Pete Kmetovic and Bob
Sweiger, all four former all-Amer-
icans.

Two former local players make
up half of the second team back-

ﬁeld. They are Len Rector and
Hugh McCullough. Rector starred
here at Pitt ten years ago, while
McCullough wore a Pittsburgli
Steeler uniform for a couple of
seasons before joining the service.
Rounding out the reserve back-
ﬁeld are John Popov and Chuck
Carey from Cincinnati and Michi-‘
gan Stale respectively.

Thus, with all this star material
to work with and having another
team and a half of better than’
average material on the bench Lt.
Hinkle doesn’t have too much to
worry about. But, unfortunately the
Panthers do. Their biggest worry
this coming Saturday will be how
to stop Great Lakes from sinking

them too deeply into the mire of
defeat.

Frosh Orientation Classes

Freshman men this year
are participating in a revised
orientation program which
has replaced the former class peri-
od of faculty and upper-classmen
instruction and which includes 9.
course in competitive athletics de-
signed for war time physical ﬁt-
ness, according to Theodore W.
Biddle, dean of men.

In place of the regular class
room orientation study, freshmen
have arranged to meet with their

upperclass counsellors for periodic -

discussions about University life.
The instruction will be similar to
that of other years except there
will be no faculty members present

at the meetings and discussion will
be more informal.

Although the orientation course
has been revised, freshmen will
be required to pass a customs
examination, as previously, with
freshman awards to be distribut-
ed about Thanksgiving day.
Awards will be determined ac-
cording to scholarship, Univer-
sity activities and adjustments,
and reports of counsellors on the
aptitude of the individual fresh-
men. ..

Noticeably absent among the
new men are the blue and gold
buttons formerly used to identify
freshman men. It has been impos-

sible to get them, Mr. Biddle ex-_

plained.
