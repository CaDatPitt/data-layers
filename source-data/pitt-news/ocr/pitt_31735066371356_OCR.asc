Local anti-nuclear groups
learn D.C. lobbying game

By Michael Fay
The Pitt News

WASHINGTON —- Over 700 students
and faculty members from Eastern universi-
ties turned out in Washington, D.C. Wed-
nesday to lobby Congress and express their
opposition to the nuclear arms race. The
event proved to be a learning experience for
both Congress and the lobbyists.

“I doubt that we changed anyone's mind,"

said Andy Hisgen, a graduate student at '

Carnegie-Mellon University, “but we let

them [Congress] know that they have con-
stituents that care, and I think that will affect
them." -

According to Pitt physics professor John
Townsend, who organized the Pittsburgh
group of 3|, the best statement to sum up the
day was made by Rep. Doug Walgren, D-
Mt. Lebanon. “Maybe the lobby today isn’t
going to affect Congress, but it will affect the
people who came," Walgren said.

The nearly 700 student and faculty lobby-
ists who packed Capitol Hill Presbyterian
Church were warned beforehand of the eva-
sion and double talk they might encounter.
Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colorado, told the
crowd, “It [lobbying] is a game. Learn it,
play it, and play it tough." '

Schroeder also added that the effort
would be more effective if the issues raised in
the meetings with representatives and sena-
tors were few and to the point. She suggested
the lobbyists stress three issues: the MX mis-
sile, the nuclear freeze and the advent of
“Star Wars" technology.

Rep. William Coyne of Pennsylvania's
District I4, which includes Pitt, was very
passive during his l5-minute meeting with a
group of Pittsburgh lobbyists, responding
almost entirely with “yes" or “no" answers.
However, he could afford to be relaxed in

their presence. Coyne, like Walgren, is one
of the few representatives who had a 100
percent record for voting against the arms
race in I983, according to the Coalition fora
New Foreign and Military Policy.

On the other hand. Senators Arlen Spec-
ter and John Heinz, both Republicans from
Pennsylvania, have not been so cooperative
with anti-arms race groups. Each senator
spoke with lobbyists for about l5 minutes.

Specter, who has voted for a nuclear
freeze, spoke frankly with a group of about
I00 Pennsylvanians. He spoke out against
the MX missile, but said that he would not
vote for a nuclear freeze again without on-
sight verification. He said he made this deci-
sion because of the size and mobility of the
missiles that are currently being developed.

Heinz received the most negative reaction
from the group. As Townsend said, “He was
evasive. He seemed to dodge and misinter-
pret questions." Heinz is apparently dead set
against a nuclear freeze. Not only did he
stress on-sight verification as prerequisite,
but he also said the United States “can‘t get
them [the U.S.S.R.] to reduce unless we
have something to reduce.”

Although the Pittsburgh group met some
obstacles, the lobbyists left Washington
even more determined to make a difference.
Elizabeth Gleba and Annmarie Benecki of
Carlow College said they plan to continue
their contributions to the peace movement
and hope'to start a core group in the near
future.

Hisgen, who is an active member of the
CMU Peace Alliance, said that his group
would also continue its efforts. Townsend
said that he has recently spoken with Aaron
Bernstein, an MIT professor and one of the
founders of The United Campuses to Pre-
vent Nuclear War (UCAM), about the possi-
bility of opening a UCAM chapter in
Pittsburgh. Townsend said that if this were
to occur, it would be a cooperative effort
between all local universities.

Pittsburgh Cancer Institute emerges

By John Gambesda
The Pitt News

Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon University
officials announced Wednesday they will
establish a new cancer treatment center, and
Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar said he
expects it will bring national recognition to
the Pittsburgh area.

The Pittsburgh Cancer Institute is the cul-
mination of two years of investigative plan-
ning and promises to provide modern,
diagnostic treatment services for cancer
patients. The institute will also house facili-
ties for cancer research, officials said. _

‘Since this region is characterized by a high rate of cancer,
we must...make major inroads into cancer. ’

--Dr. Donald Leon

Inside Today

All of the. recent corporate buy-outs will bring big
1‘ profits to the companies involved, but what will it

tives making the announcement with
Posvar.

In a joint effort, Pitt, the six University
Health Center hospitals and CMU commit-
ted $750,000 annually to the institute, which
is expected to be in full operation by next
fall. The bulk of the funding, however, will
come from federal and state grants and from
the American Cancer Society, said Dr.
Donald Leon, dean of Pitt's School of Medi-
cine. Grants for Pitt's cancer research total
about $6 million annually.

“At this point, we don’t have a major

headquarters for the institute; however, all
adult patients will be screened and assessed
at the Falk Clinic, which will be remodeled
and expanded in the coming months,“ Uni-
versity Health Center president Thomas

Detre explained. _
Formal coordination of the program will

come from the office of Nathan J. Stark,
senior vice-chancellor for health sciences at
Pitt, Detre said.

Detre said until the Falk Clinic is ready
for screening, all examinations will take
place at Children’s Hospital. In about 18

months, the universities will have the neces-
sary laboratory facilities.

Because cancer is both an in- and out-
patient operation, Detre said, efforts will
concentrate on providing “maximum free-
dom for the paricipating academicians and
physicians to do their research and to max-
imize patient care.”

The three major causes of death in this
country are trauma, heart disease and
cancer, Leon said, andthe latter two repre-
sent the leading causes among adults.

“Cancer is emerging as a greater and.
greater problem, and it is clear that what is
the second largest cause of death in adults in
this country is rapidly escalating in terms of
its percentage," Leon said. “Since this region
is characterized by a high rate of cancer, we
must, in our responsibility as a health
science center, make major in-roads into

“There is a major need to upgrade

newest advances in care so they can

be applied."
Leon said it is also important that

faculty have the opportunity to add
to their knowledge.

“Our faculty have the talent to
develop their own new information
in clinical application, and that tal-
ent can be coordinated through the
director of a cancer center so that
observations can be made as we care

Slick Deal  

In recent years, there has been a huge wave of corporate
takeovers. The proposed $13 billion buy-out of Gulf Oil by
Standard Oil of California (Socal), if allowed by Congress,

could be the largest merger in U.S. history. However, Congress ‘

could stop the takeover, as is should, if it deems the action to
“not be in the best interests of the public.”

Many of the recent buy-outs have provided opportunities for
many industries, such as steel, to consolidate and become more
efficient, thus providing greater service to the community.
However, this is not generally true for the takeovers of energy
firms, especially oil companies. These takeovers tend to only
benefit the two companies involved in the purchase. Such is the
case with the Gulf buy-out._

Socal was forced to borrow $12.4 billion of the total $13.4
billion price tag. This removes the opportunity for other bor-
rowers, public or private, to use that money with greater utility.
The lack of lendable money in bank vaults encourages the
upward trend of interest rates.

The merger will combine Socal, the nation’s fourth largest oil
company, and Gulf, the fifth largest. Thisjoining would make
Socal the nation's second largest oil producer, yet it will not
produce one extra barrel of oil. The main objection to this type
of oil-industry merger is that it removes any immediate incen-
tive to discover more oil reserves.

Socal is essentially buying Gulf’s old oil. Oil that Gulf has,

already spent billions of dollars to search, test and drill for.
Socal is getting Gulf’s oil for approximately $8 per barrel.
Socal can continue to pump from its original oil reserves until
they are exhausted and then, in turn, use the oil acquired in the
Gulf takeover. Socal will have no economic impetus to search
for oil whlth is hard to find.

The world is running out of oil. This type of corporate
merger will, in time, make the U.S. more dependent on foreign
oil companies, such as those in the politically volatile Middle
East.

The Federal Trade Commision should not allow this
takeover. It will place the American public in a position similar
to that before the devastating Arab oil embargo of I973. It will
also withdraw lendable funds from the marketplace. The
takeover is a quick, narrow-sighted windfall for the stock-
holders of Socal and Gulf Oil, but it will be paid for at the
expense of the American public.

Reagan in a no

, win situation

I never had towering respect for
The Pitt News editorials to begin
with, but last Monday's (March 5th)
editorial on the Persian Gulf war
was a new low.

The standpoint from which you
wrote the editorial seems to be a
variation on the old Jack Anderson
line of “the government cannot pos-
sibly do anything right." Your paper
seems determined that whatever
President Reagan will do, it is guar-
anteed to be wrong, simply because
he's Reagan. In this way, you lose
objectivity as well as fail to ade-
quately analyze the objectives of all
parties involved.

Reagan's policies have been a
mess in Lebanon and a terrible mess
in Central America; but as for the
Persian Gulf war, I believe he's
taken/ the basically correct course.
Neither Iraq, which started the war,
nor Iran, which will spread the Kho-
meini creed or depopulate itself try-
ing, is a very savory ally. Had we
indeed allied ourselves with one or
the other you would no doubt be
typing up an editorial condemning
the very course you now suggest.

We do have allies in the region.
The U.S. and Western Europe carry
on active trade with Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and other Persian Gulf
states. We have an interest to protect
in maintaining that trade, regardless
of what the belligerent countries
wish to do. Iran in particular is mak-

Somewhere in Oakland/ William Pierce

The packaging of the Presidency

The people of this country have
always claimed to know how to pick
political candidates. “The best man
for the job!" each potential nominee
cries out. But is this true? No! We
here in this country are caught in a
great paradox. In actuality, we get

not the best man as president but the ‘

best bankrolled man! And weall
help to make this come true. Some
by taking and carrying out respon-
siblities and others by not carrying
out responsibilities.

Now, the best way for a candidate
to get his message across to the pub-
lic is through the media. The media,
grasping their duty, cover candi-
dates’ campaigns. We, as dutiful
voters, watch, read or listen to the
candidates. We then decide upon the
best candidate‘ and cast our ballot

for that person. Right? Well, on
paper it looks good, but in practice,

this system fails miserably. Media
time costs a lot of money. Thus,
campaigns require a lot of organiza-

tion in _orde_r to raise the money
a required.

Further, we as voters watch, listen
and read the media coverage and
then vote for the person whom we
remember the best. Advertising of
products is just like this. In the end,
it’s how well the product was pack-
aged and how well people remem-
bered the name. So then, if the
candidate becomes president and he
doesn’t live up to expectations, we
complain. But, we have only our-
selves to blame. We never read the
ingredients on the label, we only

‘To hell with imoney
and organization, the
ideas count.’

watch the ad.

How does this add up? It becomes
necessary for a candidate to have a
lot of money in order to splash his
name before our eyes so we'll

remember it come election day. The
media, ofcourse, enjoy and promote
all this by giving projected winners
hours before elections are over.
Thus, -they influence voters who
have not yet voted by telling them
who already won, giving’ them the

ing noises to the effect that ifthe war
prevents them from exporting oil,
they will make sure nobody else in
the Persian Gulf will export either.
The U.S.’s interest is to ensure that
this does not affect our nonbelliger-
ent allies, and not to get involved in a
singularly insane, bloody conflict.

I suggest you look at the options
more closely before you go ahead
with your instinctive reaction to kick
at Reagan.

Minorities have
easy way out

In response to Daryl Davis‘article
in the Feb. 27 edition of The Pitt
News, I would like to say that I am
unequivocally against the lowering
of academic standards for minority
students, every bit as strongly as I
am against “racial quotas" in the
business world.

Neither the government nor any
other institution owes anyone any-
thing. An alternative to having a
competitive institution lower its aca-
demic standards is the Community
College. To illustrate the implemen-
tation of such an approach, allow
me to relate to you the experiences
of a man I know who graduated
eighth from the bottom in a high
school class of 786 students. When
he decided ten years later to pursue a
career which required a college edu-
cation, he first had to attend a Com-
munity College to establish some

impression their vote is worthless.
This all goes against the notion on
which we were weaned —— the object
of putting the best man in the White
House. This system turns many peo-
ple off, and we may never see truly
good candidates as a result.

What is the answer? First ofall, as
voters, we should all take more
seriously our responsibility of sifting

through candidates. Party lines and
labels be damned, pick who you
think is best! To hell with money and
organization, the ideas count.

The media, too, should practice
better ethics. But, of course, they’lI
scream bloody First Amendment
_r_nurder if any suggestion of chang-
ing their role is mentioned. Soto hell

credibility. This he did handily, not
only earning a 4.0 QPA with I7 cred-
its, but also selling his truck to pa/J
his tuition. Thus he went beyond
merely proving himself, exemplify-
ing the principle that there is no sub-
stitute for hard work, and that
sometimes one must start out with
what little one has, and work one’s
way up.

A winning attitude and the suc-
cess that it breeds can't be legislated;
it can only be gained through hard
work, finding a way to beat the sys-
tem, and most importantly, seeking"
out and pursuing that for which you
were created — and doing so with all
your might.

banking machines
to college.

It was the only intelligent thing to
do-——make banking more convenient
for the University of Pittsburgh
campus community. So Mellon Bank
has installed two CashStream bank-
ing machines at the William Pitt
Union. They’re open 24 hours a day,
everyday, weekends and holidays
included. Mellon is also a member of
the CIRRUS national banking
machine network, which means that
Mellon customers can use their bank-
ing cards in any Mellon machine,
any CashStream machine, or get
cash from any CIRRUS machine.

Don’t use it just for emergencies.
The CashStream banking machines
can do more than just dispense cash
when you need it. You can make
deposits, transfer funds between
your checking and savings accounts,
and check your account balance.*

It’s easy.

If the place where you bank is a part
of CashStream, all you need is a
banking card. The machine will give
you easy-tounderstand instructions
for the few steps it takes to complete
your transaction. In a couple of
minutes, you’re on your way.

Demonstrations and prizes too!
Drop by our new CashStream ma-
chines and get a free gift for taking
part in a machine demonstration.
Place: The William Pitt Union at the
University of Pittsburgh on
Forbes Avenue in Oakland.
Dates: Tuesday through Friday,
March 13-16.
Time: 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM.

Try our new CashStream machines
at the University of Pittsburgh; we
think you’ll be glad we sent our
banking machines to college.

*Services at CashStream machines may vary according
to state and participant rules.

Oakland residents

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

Free parking in central Oakland
may soon be a thing of the past.
Local residents are currently taking
the final steps toward implementing
a parking program that will make
commuter parking illegal on the
streets in this area.

Because of the high number of
commuters, parking has always
been a problem for Oakland, but
many residents hope this long-
standing problem will be corrected
by permit parking. Residents and
representatives discussed the park-
ing program at a community meet-
ing, Tuesday, March 6, at the
University Inn.

Permit parking will be imple-
mented after a planning hearing is
completed in late April. Residents
and students will need to purchase a
permit to park near their homes. The
residential district the community is
considering includes the area
between Bouquet Street and McKee
Place and will be bordered by
Forbes Avenue and Boundary
Street.

Parking sticker permits are avail-
able to area residents for 8 ID a year.
Those who park without a permit
will have a grace period of 1-2 hours,
depending on the final decision

v

Richard Meritzer and Ed Gerge-
rich of the department of public
works were present at the meeting to
assist Oakland residents in making
the decision.

Meritzer said he is surveying the
area and counting the number of
units and looking a-t the opportuni-
ties for parking that are currently
being missed.

Meritzer has been walking
through the neighborhoods for sev-
eral weeks taking the license
numbers of parked cars and later
checking their registrations to see if
the owner is a resident or a commu-
ter who is taking the spaces right-
fully belonging to people who live at
that address.

Competition for parking spaces
between residents, commuting stu-
dents and local hospital employees is
a daily scramble in this area.

Residents who attended last Tues-
d/ay’s meeting spoke with depart-
ment of public works officials and
agreed that hospital employees, not
the students, are the problem. But
residents were also quick to point
out that students who live in the
dorms can forget about parking on
the street all week.

Sticker permit parking was first
introduced to Oakland last summer
when Halket, Louisa and Chester-
field Streets were converted to
sticker parking. Sticker parking is
also the rule in other areas of the city
such as the North Side, Bloomfield

The Pitt Ne'w‘s, Friday,

 have to pay fo

gram has produced some desired
results.

Sandra Phillips, planning com-
mission chairman for Oakland
Directions Inc. said “it's [the exist-
ing program] made a big difference,
even on Chesterfield, where it‘s not
working real well, it's a drastic
improvement.”

Enforcement is a major problem
with the parking program in this
area, according to head of meter-
maids Margaret Sladick. “I can't
understand where the enforcement
would come from. There's just no
way; we don't have the manpower."

She said metermaids write their
last tickets at 2 a.m. and afterwards,
.no violators are ticketed. The permit
parking on Chesterfield is especially
ineffective at this time because
employees of the hospital park there
for their last shift.

Although this program must wait

‘for city planning approval, com-

munity members are circulating
petitions in an effort to get 70 per-
cent of the residents in central Oak-
land to sign in favor of permit
parking.

Student and Oakland resident
Norman Kerr is one of many who
parks his car in this area.

It's not going to guarantee a
[parking] space,“ he said. “It’s unen-
forceabIe....You’re going to have the
same situation."

“But if it did work, it would be
worth $l0 to find a parking place
that's within a reasonable distance."

Speaker stresses responsibility

Convocation honors scholarship

By G. Warren Mayers
The Pitt News

“The University of Pittsburgh is
exercising leadership in the use of
electronic technologies
advancement of education, but these
are merely tools to help the scholar.
We create the tools and we are
responsible for their use."

.3 Harvard University professor
Anthony Oettinger delivered these
remarks Wednesday at Pitt’s annual
Honors Convocation before an
audience of I700 students, faculty,
alumni and family members at Car-
negie Music Hall.

In his address, entitled “Elec-
tronic Scholarship,” Oettinger
praised technology as an educa-
tional aid, but warned that “technol-
ogy cannot replace the individual."

“Technologies can help us, but we
must return to the source, which is
the scholar. There is no substitute

‘or the integrity of the scholar,”Oet-
tinger said.

Oettinger said he disagrees with
the idea that some day machines will
replace human beings in the work
place.

“The decision on who does what
with technology is a political deci-
sion. It is not the technology itself
that should be blamed, but the peo-

tion and use. We therefore have to
be responsible,” Oettinger said.

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
presided over the event and con-
ferred an honorary Doctor of Let-
ters degree upon Oettinger, a
Gordon McKay Professor of App-
lied Mathematics and chairman of
the program in Information Resour-
ces Policy at Harvard.

Oettinger, a native of Nuremberg,
Germany, received both his under-
graduate and graduate degrees from
Harvard. He was also a Henry Fel-
low at the University of Cambridge
in England and has held chairman-
ships at the Computer Science and
Engineering Board and at the
National Academy of Sciences.

“Dr. Oettinger is recognized
nationally and internationally as a
preeminent scholar in the informa-
tion field." said Thomas Galvin,
dean of Pitt's School of Library and
Information Science. “His several
concurrent faculty appointments at
Harvard exemplify the interdiscipli-
nary character of his own scholarly
achievements in a ﬁeld that is itself
multidisciplinary in character."

Oettinger is the author of several
books, including “Run Computer
Run: The Mythology of Educa-
tional Innovation," “The Study for
the Design of an Automatic Diction-
ary” and “High and Low Politics:

This year’s Honors Convocation
saluted those students and faculty
who have attained the highest aca-
demic records at Pitt and those who
have received scholarships and
awards from professional or service
organizations. Area high school
seniors who won the I983 Provost's
Academic Scholarship Competition
were also honored.

Junior Donna Roberts, 20, ofthe
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS),

was awarded a scholarship to con- V

tinue her studies in politics, econom-
ics. and philosophy through
graduate school. After the convoca-
tion, she reacted positively to Oct-
tinger’s remarks.

“His comments are timely because
of the information revolution. I felt
that it was important for him to
emphasize that individuals are
responsible for technology,"
Roberts said.

Roberts said she has no imme-
diate career plans beyond the com-
pletion of her current class schedule
and fulfilling the requirements for a
Bachelor of Science degree.

After explaining her plans to a
reporter, she turned and ran for a
class in Forbes Quadrangle, saying
she was five minutes late.

For the first time in the history
of the University of Pittsburgh
Writers‘ Conference, the study of
film will be included in the
agenda along with the other
fields in writing. This year, the
conference will begin on Friday
evening, March I6, with the
showing of “Cattle Annie and
Little Britches.” Immediately
afterward, Robert Ward, author
of both the film and the novel
from which it was adapted, will
respond to questions and com-
ments from the audience.

Ward will also conduct a ses-
sion, “Translating The Novel
Into Film," where he will discuss
the challenges and techniques of
creating cinema from prose. The
session is scheduled for ll a.m.
Sunday, March l8, at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.

“Cattle Annie And Little
Britches" is a charming story
based on the lives of two restless
young women who live in the Old
West of the l890s and join the
famous Doolin-Dalton outlaw
gang. Directed by Lamont John-
son and starring Amanda
Plummer, Diane Lane. Burt
Lancaster and Scott Glenn, the
film was released in I980, receiv-
ing critical acclaim but little

In addition to working as a
novelist and screenwriter,
Robert Ward is also a journalist
whose work has appeared in a

The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
accepted the Allocations Commit-
tee‘s recommendations for the
budgets of 36 student organizations
at last night's meeting. Students for
Life was among the groups whose
budget was approved.

Last week, board member Avery
Abrams accused the Students For
Life group of misusing Pitt News ad
funds for ideological messages

which were published last year.
However, after the Allocations
Committee investigated the matter,
Allocations chairman Steve Smith
said no misuse of university funds
occurred.

Abrams apologized to Student
For Life president Rebecca Mar-
shall for the confusion. The controv-
ersy occurred. Marshall said,
because pro-life definitions and
opinions appeared in the personals
section of The Pitt News last year.
The group, however, did not pav for

Marshall accepted Abrams‘ apol-
ogy and was visibly pleased that the
situation had been clarified. She said
she understood how the confusion
could have occurred, especially since
last year’s budget request form dif-
fered from the present one.

The budget of the Heinz Chapel
Choir, which had also been sent
back to the committee for reconsid-
eration last week. is still undecided.
Smith said that the budget had been
reconsidered but that Allocations

did not change its recommendations
to not fund the choir’s annual camp
or its request for an honorarium to
pay for musicians for its Christmas
concert.

Smith said that Allocations
recommended that the camp not be
funded for various reasons. Among
those reasons were the existence of
adequate rehearsal facilities on cam-
pus and the need for consistency.
The Pitt Men's (ilce Club’s request
for its camp was denied earlier in the
evening.

The reason for the recommenda-
tion not to fund the honorarium
request was-that the committee will
not pay for professional musicians
with student money.

Choir president Jim Shaughnessy
stated that the choir's request for
professional musicians was not any

different than that of a student .

organization that requests funds to
hire a band for its formal. It is the
policy of the committee to pay for
hall rental. tickets and band when a

formal is requested. Smith state”.

that he failed to see the similarity
between the two.

The vote on the choir’s budget was
inconclusive. The vote, held after a
movement to accept the committee’s
recommendations with the stipula-
tion that it include the honorarium,
was 4-4. The budget was then turned

over to the board for final
disposition.
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity

member Anthony DeFiore present-
ed a special report asking the board
to support the'creation of a frater-
nity unification task force. Thi
committee comes as a response to
Amherst College's decision to expel
all fraternities for their conduct.

Because the majority of fraterni-
ties are moving to the new fraternity
housing complexes, DeFiore said.
there will be a need for the unifica-
tion of Pitt's fraternities.

Board member David Pikovs
asked DeFiore ifthere would be at?
reason for Pitt to follow Amherst‘s
lead in expelling fraternities.

DeFiore r 'ponded that abso-
lutely nothi of the sort is happen-
ing at Pitt and added that the key
purpose of the group is to provide an
open forum for discussion among
fraternities.

Board member Bob Kramer;
Interfraternitv Council liaison. said
he fully supports the new committee
and Will help in any way he can.

In the Name. of the Father

By MARY TABASKO
And IIM SHAUGHNESSY

Miracles are in rather short supply
these days. John Pielmeier’s Agnes of

“God, which opened at the Stanley

Theatre on Tuesday night, is a story
about miracles.

Agnes of God, a three-character play
starring Peggy Cass, Susan Strasberg
and Lynn Chausow, is the story of
Agnes, a 21-year-old nun who gives
birth to a baby, who is later discov-
ered dead.

While it sounds as though Agnes has
the potential to be just another
murder mystery -— who was the

Qfather, how did the baby die? Piel-

meier has circumvented this problem
by making Agnes a multi—faceted psy-
chological/religious drama.

The real conflict in the story is that
between science and religion. Stras-
berg, playing Dr. Martha Living-
stone, a chain-smoking psychiatrist,
represents science and all its objectiv-

Qty. She believes in the miracle of

birth, but not in miraculous births.

Livingstone, an atheist by choice,
has personal reasons for her loss of
faith. Among them, the death of a
friend in first grade and the death of
her sister Marie, who was a postulate
in a convent at the time of her death
from acute appendicitis.

Miriam, on the other hand, has

.turned to religion and the relative

seclusion of the convent after failure

in the outside world. She had been
married and was the mother of two
daughters. She had tried to protect
her daughters from the outside
world, and they in turn resented her
protectiveness. Her daughters, who
have become atheists, have broken
communication with her since her
entrance into the convent. After
being a failure as a wife and mother,
she turned to religion upon the death
of her husband.

The conflict between these two is
the major motivational force driving
Agnes of God throughout its riveting
two hours. Miriam and Livingstone
engage in a battle of beliefs over the
handling of the case. Each has per-
sonal reasons for wanting to help
Agnes, and each feels that her way is
the best.

Livingstone has been appointed by
the court to determine the mental
status of Agnes. Upon her first meet-
ing with Miriam, she discovers that
Miriam just wants her to evaluate
Agnes, make her recommendation to
the court and get out. She is afraid
that Livingstone will somehow taint
Agnes, whom she regards as ”an
innocent.”

Livingstone does not believe that
Agnes is blessed. She clings instead to
her scientific convictions. There had
to be a father of Agnes’ baby; Agnes
could not be that naive not to know
where babies come from or how they
are produced. She wants answers.

Convinced that she can get Agnes
acquitted on the basis of legal, if not
actual, innocence, Livingstone delves
into Agnes’ psyche, which is more
damaged than it first seems. During
her first scene, Agnes appears to be
the epitome of innocence, untouched
by the realities of the modern world.
As the action progresses, we realize
that she is not so much a tabula rasa
as she is a slate erased by past
traumas.

In her quest for truth, Livingstone
hypnotizes Agnes and manages to
penetrate her apparent blankness
and innocence to discover horrors.
All the while, Miriam questions Liv-
ingstone’s motives and methods. She
is willing to accept the birth as an act
of God. She is familiar with the ways
of" the outside world -and wants to
protect Agnes and her innocence
from them.

Strasberg is convincing as Living-
stone. She is not afraid to show her
character's emotions and weak-
nesses. She can be very volatile in her
dealings with Miriam, but at no time
do her emotions interfere with her
interactions with Agnes.

Through narration, she reveals
parts of her character's past, which
allows for the understanding of her
point of view. The part of Living-
stone would be an easy one to misin-
terpret. It requires a good
understanding of how people deal
with religious doubts and with those

who have strong religious beliefs.

Playing off Strasberg’s Livingstone
is Cass’ Miriam, a character who has
also experienced doubts but has man-
aged to reconcile them. Cass is won-
derful as the blustery Miriam. Not
your_typical nun, Miriam is played
with sensitivity and a non-irreverent
lack of piousness.

Perhaps the most difficult role is
that of Agnes, played with great
honesty by new-comer Chausow.
Chausow’s voice has an odd quality
that lends itself to Agnes. Agnes, an
emotionally disturbed young woman,
must be portrayed with a quality that
is somewhere between ”touched by
God” as Miriam would like to believe
and ”psychologically disturbed” as
Livingstone sees her.

Chausow conveys the pathos of
Agnes through her actions and
responses to events around her. She
must be able to react to events in her
head while at the same time con-
fronting the reality of the situation in
which she finds herself. It is a
demanding role emotionally, and
Chausow is compelling in her inter-
pretation of the driven, emotionally
scarred Agnes.

While dealing with such a serious
theme, Agnes is not devoid of comedy.
Pielmeier is to be thanked for this. He
has written a script that is intelligent,
entertaining and thought-provoking
—— a true miracle in every sense of the
word.

Losing

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

The ad for Against All Odds shows a
sultry brunette and athletic blond
man locked in passionate embrace on
a sandy beach (shades of From Here To
Eternity), while the accompanying des-
cription uses words like ”love,"
”obsession" and ”murder.” Hey, even
if this movie isn't the next Gone With
The Wind, it couldn't possibly be bor-
ing -— could it? Sex, violence, big stars
and a famous director? Aw, come on,
it's got to be good — doesn't it?!
Weelll....

Nobody ever said anything was
foolproof, except, perhaps, the folks
associated with this film, who
thought they had themselves a sure
winner —— but surely not the
audience, who, despite initial enthu-
siasm, find themselves counting pop-
corn kernels and falling asleep out of
sheer boredom.

Screenwriter Eric Hughes alone
shoulders the blame for this agitating

\ 120 minutes. This supposed "plot”

never delivers what you hope it will,
nor does it bother to make any sense
once it decides to give you the low-
down on its intricacies. In the end, the
audience is left scratching their heads
and wondering what the last two
hours of their lives meant and why
$4.25 is missing from their wallets.

"Not that it'll make much differ-
ence, but just for the record, here's
what I think the plot is — sort of:
Poor little rich girl Rachel Ward gets
involved with slimy nightclub owner
James Woods to spite her mother, a
rich society matron who owns the
city's football team. But the slime-
ball's sort of kinky and slaps her just
once too often, so she runs away to a
remote part of Mexico to hide from
him (she has to hide because, even
though he's a slimeball, he's madly in
love with her — "obsessed" is how
the ad puts it).

Enter Jeff Bridges, a broken-down
football player who's just been cut
from Mummy’s team. He also owes
Woods a few favors and, seeing how
he's in debt, allows himself to be
coerced by Woods into finding the

‘missing Ward. Off he goes to Mexico

in search of the elusive rich beauty
(who's pretty easy to trace since she's
been drawing money from her trust
fund in a Mexican bank) and, just
maybe, a good tan. Naturally, he
finds her, and they wind up having
steamy jungle sex under trees, on
sandy beaches and — oh, you get the
idea.

So, anyway — are you still there?
—- they run further into the jungle in
the fervent hope that Woods won't
catch up with them. While they're
engaged in sweaty sex inside some
ancient tribal cave — surprise, sur-
prise — Alex Karras, the football
team's trainer and a good friend of
Bridges, shows up. Besides the fact
that it's a bad time for conversation,
something else isn't so peachy about
l(arras' visit: he's there to kill Bridges
and take Ward back to the slimeball.
Alas, the tables get turned, and Kar-
ras ends up in the bottom of a quarry.
Ward runs away again, but when
Bridges returns to L.A., he discovers
she's moved back in with Woods -
huh?!?

This is where everything com-
pletely breaks down and stops mak-
ing any sense whatsoever. Jewish

 

lawyers are found with bullet holes in
their craniums, Doberman pinschers
growl and snap at drunken secretar-
ies, people play volleyball on the
Malibu beach, more murders occur,
and in the movie's best 30 seconds,
Kid Creole and the Coconuts per-
form onstage at the slimeball's night-
club. And if you haven't run from the
theater by the time the credits roll,
you'll see a windblown Ward crying
beside the lists of "Best Boy,”
"Gaffer," "Makeup Artist" and so on.
Touching. Really.

Jeff Bries and'Rachel Wafd star in Agzzirzst All Ods

Now that you have the capsulized
version (and, believe me, it's
smoother than what you'll see on the
screen), there's positively no reason
to go see Against All Odds. Unless, of
course, you fell terminally in love
with Rachel Ward in one of her past
roles (Sharlcy's Machine, Dead Men Don't
Wear Plaid or'The Thorn Birds), which
would be understandable.

Jeff Bridges doesn't quite look the
part of a football player past his prime
— he's far too lean and young-
looking '— but he brings to his charac-

ter a restless quality that rings true of
a man in his situation. James Woods
continues to play weirdo parts (nota-
bly, The Onion Field and Videodrome) but
with an appealing edginess and just a
spark of vulnerability. You may not
like his character, but there's never a
dull moment when he's on the screen.

The people are pretty, the locations
are exotic, and the director is famous
(Taylor Hackford of An Officer And A
Gentleman fame). However, even with
these odds in its favor, Against All
Odds might as well fold.

Things Get Better Second Time

RICOCHET DAYS
Modern English
Sire

Modern English had a prob-
lem this year. It's not an unusual
problem, and it's always inter-
esting to see how bands cope
with it. It's called the "second

album crisis" (truth is, it's their .

third, but only their second
release in the States). Modern
English had a very snappy song
last year in "I Melt With You.” It
was perfect. It was a love song.
It was cheery. It had a chorus
you could sing along with, and it

looked OK on MTV. Now,‘

they've got to follow it up, so
what do they do?

They get some of their
friends to" play funny instru-
ments for them -- that's what!
On Ricochet Days, filling out the
usual drums, bass, guitar, key-
boards and voice lineup is oboe,
violin, cello, string quartet,
tabla, parfdit dinesh (no, I don't
know what it is, either) and con-
gas. And the ploy works! Maybe
that's because I'm a sucker for
polyrhythms and Third World
sounds. Who knows? Who

KEEP MOVING
Madness
Geffen

Keep Moving is the latest from
the nutty seven (actually six;
keyboardist Mike Barson has
recently split) called Madness,

_ and quite frankly, it's just as

inconsistent as their last three
U.K. releases.

The incongruity arises from
the fact that although Madness
is a hard-working band with a
wonderful sense of humor -
which shows on their singles
like "House of Fun," ”Cardiac
Arrest,” ”One Step Beyond”
and "Our House" — they just
can't seem to carry off the zany
pop brilliance of their singles for
an entire album.

This happens to be the prob-
lem with Keep Moving, the band's
second release for Geffen. The
album sports three possible sin-
gles —— ”Michael Caine,” "Wings
Of A Dove" and the title track
— that exude the hooks, jokes
and fun of classic Madness.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO >0O00O00OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOQOOQO

cares? It works, and that's what

' counts.

Side one opens with ”Rain-
bow’s End," a pointless but plea-
sant ditty about a better place to
live. ”Machines" is a plodding
technopop venture that has a
phalanged bass like New Order
and a relentlessness that's
satisfying. "Spinning Me
Round" borrows the song title
and the sound from modern-
day Roxy Music, a band that
Modern English has opened for
in concert. It has a thick, seam-
less quality with vibes mixed

way up front, and it's danceable .

in"a polite sort of way. Closing
out the side is the title cut,
"Ricochet Days," a pretty song,
with Robbie Grey singing a
repeating melody and Gary
McDowell following the same
figure a note behind him on gui-
tar, like an echo or, better yet,
singing in the round. Unfortu-
nately, the song closes with a
completely unnecessary foray
into power funk with a chorus
added for theclimax.

The album shows it's limita-
tions on side two. The opener,
"Hands Across the Sea," is

"Michael Caine" is the real
winner ofithe set and even
includes the British actor say-
ing, "My name is Michael

Caine” in a wonderfully dead-_

pan voice.

Yet, the remainder of the
album plays without any distin-
guishing marks or interesting
characteristics —- it's all real
pleasant but not very memora-
ble as pop music goes. This is
good music to read by; very little
on the album competes for
attention.

Sad to say, Keep Moving finds
Madness becoming just a minor
auditory disturbance instead of
the full-blown pop insanity
they've been credited with
being in the past.

really forgettable. The lyrics —
"I did not mean to hurt you/You
took me by surprise/There still
is a chance if we just close our
eyes/Ooohhh lady" — will not
likely illuminate the grand mys-
tery of human relations. ”Blue
Waves" attempts to borrow the
melody of "I Melt With You" in a
far too obvious fashion. The
rest of the album gets a little too
caught upin symphonic intros

than five years now, they have
yet to create much of an identity
for themselves. While last year's
"Promised You A Miracle"
attracted a good bit of attention
for the band and forced scores
of people onto the dance floor, it
did little in terms of overcoming
Simple Minds’ identity crisis.

Identity, in fact, seems to be
the major concern on Simple
Minds’ new record, Sparkle in the
Rain. With the employment of
producer Steve Lillywhite, Sim-
ple Minds, whose previous
work has occasionally run the
gamut of musical styles, have
set their sights on the resurging
psychedelic movement. And
who better than Steve Lilly-
white to achieve this?

Lillywhite already claims last
year's masterpiece, U2's War, as
well as albums by Big Country,
the Psychedelic Furs and Peter
Gabriel on his long list of
accomplishments. A proven
master of the atmospheric,
wall-of-noise sound, Lillywhite
is brilliant once again on Sparkle
in the Rain; unfortunately, Sim-
ple Minds is something less.

What Simple Minds prove
more than anything else on
Sparkle in the Rain is that even too
much of a good thing can be
overdone. With War as the
obvious influence, Simple
Minds goes too far in its patron-
age of 1983's near flawless per-
formance by U2. While the
intention of recreating some-
thing on the scale of last year's
finest album is ‘admirable, it
likewise sets standards higher
than Simple Minds are capable
of meeting.

Although there is no one par-
ticular song onwSparkle in the Rain
that really flounders, collec-
tively, the music fails to be
inspiring, which is its foremost
intention. The lyrics aren't
nearly pointed enough to pro-

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGOOQ0000 DOOOOOOOOOOO

     

and midsong flourishes. All the
violins make it sound grandiose
and schmaltzy. .

On the whole, the new record
from Modern English works.
They're not the most amazing
writers, but the arrangements
are mostly innovative and fresh.
And Robbie Grey has a better
haircut.

MICHAEL SELZ

voke the desired effect, and
vocalist Jim Kerr is decidedly
short on the passion that comes
so naturally to Bono Vox.

However, individual redemp-
tion abounds on Sparkle in the
Rain: the slippery opening track,
"Up on the Catwalk,” ”Speed
Your Love to Me," "Water-
front," "The Kick Inside of Me"
and the closing instrumental,
"Shake Off the Ghosts," are all
worthwhile efforts. Their con-
tribution to the final product,
however, remains clouded by
their obvious connection with
other neo-psychedelics, particu-
larly Echo and the Bunnymen
and U2.

And so after five years and
four American releases, Simple
Minds have finally created an
identity. All that remains is for
them to make it their own.

99 LUFTBALLONS
Nena
Epic

If ever an lp would have to
rely upon the strength of a
chart-topping single for com-
mercial impetus...ladies and
gentlemen, presenting Nena's
99 Luftballons.

‘Side one begins with a faint-
hearted English delivery of "99
Red Balloons." No fault found
here. Consider the task: it is
much akin to asking John Cou-
gar Mellencamp for a spirited
German version of ’’Pink
Houses." Weak, weak, weak.
However, it does rate a "7." It's
practically danceable.

The remainder of the side is
an excursion into breathy pop
with pseudo-new wave synth
treatments. Gets a bit boring
after the second sigh. "Just A
Dream" has potential but prob-

ably more because it sounds like
Berlin than Nena (I'm still try-
ing to figure out what they
sound like). Interesting synth
touches and a break-neck beat
give the number allure, but the
lyrics aren't memorable.
”There’s nothing else I wanna
do/l spend all day dreaming of
you...” And roses are red and
violets are blue. Hmmm.

”Let Me Be Your Pirate" with
its catchy sax interludes is cer-
tainly listenable, even though it
sounds more like an AM Andy
Gibb throwaway than anything
new. But wait. For all you Deut-
schelanders, there is salvation
(flip the record over).

Here we have six songs, titled
and performed. solely in Ger-

K.C. TEN
K.C.
MCA

Hasn't anyone informed K.C.
(of K.C. and the Sunshine Band

fame) that disco died when
Donna Summer moved on to
better things, when Andy Gibb
started taking drugs and when
the Village People exhausted
their gimmick? Obviously not,
because the only achievement
of K.C.’s K.C. Ten album is that it
sinks disco even further into its
grave.

K.C. Ten is a collection of 10
songs about the pursuit of
happiness in chaotic, repeti-
tious, entirely boring little mel-

. odies. When a song begins to get

motivating, the weak musician-
ship provides the overkill.
When a song begins to carry a
more upbeat tone, K.C.’s
monotonous voice ruins every-
thing. Background vocalists

outdo him on just about every,

track, and the best vocal per-
formance on the album comes

 

from Margaret Reynolds,

K.C. has aged, not like a fine
wine but more like a bad
memory. This is evident from
the unflattering album cover
photos and from anyone who
witnessed his near-fatal heart
attack after his first chorus of
singing on Solid Gold (and we
won't even begin to mention his
black leather outfit).

Suffice it to say that K.C. is
lucky he's still on a major label,
but it's hard to say what's going
to happen to that arrangement.‘
”I’ve got class,” K.C. repeats on

one of the cuts. If he's got class, .

then I'm waiting for the day Boy
George tries out for the Pitts-
burgh Maulers. And what of the
single released from K.C. Ten
called "Give It Up”? Well, it
couldn't be more appropriate.

HOW TO GET INTO COMMER-
CIALS

By Vangie Hayes and Gloria
Hainline

Harper 8: Row

Television commercials must be a
lot harder to make than they appear.
Or else those homemade jobs for fur-
niture shops and car dealerships —
omnipresent on the late—night tube
—— would not be so amateurishly god-
awful. Talent scout Vangie Hayes
draws upon her years of experience
for How To Get Into Commercials, a
chatty and optimistic travel guide to
the entire process, naturally much
more complicated than it appears.

"A little charm and a lot of humor
go a long way,” Hayes says. Do you
want toappear in television commer-
cials? Decide your type, following
Hayes’ outline — are you the cos-
metic model type? The young mother
sort? Have professional photographs
taken which which accurately reflect
yourself, put together ‘a resume,
scout for contracts, land auditions
and advertise that product on TV.

Other options are also open that
-might better suit your aims. Good
vocal chords can be used for radio or
voice-over announcing. ”OK, so you
own a cougar." Hayes explains how
you might put your unusual pet or
child or distinctive apartment into
commercials.

Not surprisingly, commitment —
mental and monetary — is the key to
even limited success (i.e., profit).
Hayes and co-author Gloria Hainline
infuse the text with the sort of optim-
ism that would prove essential to the
commercial performer, particularly

any beginner. How To Get Into Commer-
cials offers sensible and thorough
advice — an encouraging word for
those who have convinced them-
selves beforehand that they want to
do it.

ON WRITING THE SHORT
STORY

By Hallie Burnett

Harper & Row

Author and editor Hallie Burnett
condenses her years of experience
into a slim volume: On Writing the Short
Story. Considering her credentials,
however, the book yields little for the
serious fiction writer. '

Burnett researched a number of
established artists —— as diverse as
Ray Bradbury, Gertrude Stein, Cun-
ter Grass and Mark Twain —— for
their habits, opinions and advice con-
cerning the writing process. She
quotes in depth, bridging the material
with her comments. The information
is certainly agreeable (William
Faulkner called writing "99 percent
talent, 99 percent discipline and 99
percent work”) but of comparatively
little practical use.

Burnett takes advantage of the
”on” in her title, offering 81 pages of
rather vague philosophy that rarely
approaches concrete usage. Her pat,
polite approach to the subject seems
motherly in tone — not patronizing,
but precious, a quaint embroidered
sampler. She discusses the elements
of short story composition — style,
plot, characterization, work habits —
but her observations do not gel into
practical advice.

Six short stories flesh out the book
—— ”proof of the pudding,” Burnett
says —— to illustrate the results and
the rewards. ”Sawdust,” by an other-
wise unknown Arthur Foff, over-
shadows early efforts from Truman
Capote, Tennessee Williams Erskine
Caldwell and Burnett herself.

"Read," says Burnett at last;
”because one could explain endlessly
what a short story is and what it is
not, and the «results would be the
same as if an explorer tried to des-
cribe a mirror to a savage who has
neverlooked into one nor seen his
own reflection.” Her suggestion
renders On Writing the Short Story

somewhat redundant.

’ HOW CAN YOU DEFEND THOSE

PEOPLE?
James S. Kunen
Random House

Better that many guilty shall go
free rather than one innocent
should suffer.

—]ohn Adams‘

”Remember this,” writes James S.
Kunen before he dives into How Can
You Defend Those People?, and he means
it, for this is the creed of the defense
attorney as much as this book is an
anthem written for America's
unsung public defenders.

Kunen, who also authored The
Strawberry Statement, has recalled his
two and a half years with the Public
Defender Service of Washington,
D.C., in a revealing and often intros-
pective look at a special breed of
lawyer——the notorious public
defender.

His perspective portrays the
defense attorney's job as one that is
controversial, unglamorous and that
demands moral justification — not
only for the naive public, but often
for the lawyer himself. After all, it's
not easy to defend someone who the
public firmly, though prematurely,
believes is guilty.

Kunen's.book is a fascinating and
ultimately convincing defense of
criminal lawyers. Through the pres-
entation of cases he's handled, he
articulates how a public defender
ticks and, sometimes, how he keeps
himself ticking in a legal system that
has nothing to do with common sense
— a place where cases are won by the
power of persuasion and truth is
often created instead of recreated by
the attorneys. The cases Kunen pres-
ents are not out of the ordinary and
feature typical defendants, like poor
black people living in the inner city.

His prose is simple, straightfor-
ward and doesn't require a Philadel-
phia lawyer to decipher. Kunen
doesn't flaunt legal jargon, but when
it's necessary, he translates in suc-
cinct, easily comprehensible
passages.

Kunen’s conclusion is that yes, the
legal system does indeed work in its
own cockeyed way, but that by no
means ”Should one conclude that jus-
tice prevails in Washington.” This
may sound like paradox, but Kunen
makes and wins his case in a land-
mark book that can be enjoyed by the
professional and the layperson alike.

The Pitt News

NEW YORK The Villanova

Wildcats relied on Panther mistakes
and Ed Pinekney’s strong second
half to dispose of Pitt, 75-05, in the
quarterfinals of the Big East basket-
ball championship tournament yes-
terday at Madison Square Garden.

Pinckney scored l7 points in the

second half, 21 overall, and pulled
down I2 rebounds.

As a team, Pitt committed 22
turnovers and 3l personal fouls.
Four Panthers - Andre Williams,
Keith Armstrong, Joey David and
George Allen -— fouled out.

“I think there was too much Ed
Pinckney out there today," Pitt
coach Roy Chipman said. “But I
think the most significant ingredient
to the loss was when George Allen
got his fourth foul.

“Without George Allen, we

couldn‘t penetrate. When he was in
‘there. we seemed to control [the
tempo].“
_ Despite his early exit, Allen fin-
ished with 2| points and almost
single-handedly provided Pitt with
its last run at the Wildcats.

With 7:08 remaining in the game
and Villanova leading 53-49, Allen
caught fire. scoring I l of Pitt's next
l5 points and drawing the Panthers
within seven with 2:l8 to go. The

junior committed his fifth foul with

l:55 left and was forced to sit and
watch the rest.

“The whole thing was the foul
trouble,“ Allen said. “Coach [Chip-
man] kept telling me to keep shoot-
ing because I was hot.“

_The Panthers managed to close
within six points at the l:44 mark on
a Clyde Vaughan rebound and
layup.

Vaughan closed out his Big East
career with 23 points, ll rebounds
and four assists. He broke Larry
Harris‘ seven-year-old Pitt all-time
scoring record on a foul shot at the
l5:49 mark of the first half. There
was an official timeout and a stand-
ing ovation given Vaughan.

Senior point guard Billy Culbert-
son and forward Andre Williams
seemed to be taken out of their
games by the Wildcats. The two

combined for three points, eight
turnovers and eight fouls.

Thompson. “They just laughed and
after that I think we relaxed a little.

“We played poorly tonight. and
we hope tomorrow is a better day,“
Thompson said. “We were very for-
tunate to have won this game
todayf‘

St. Johns and Georgetown split
their meetings during the regular
season, each winning on the other‘s
home court.

“I don't really know what hap-
pened out there today,“ Culbertson
said. “I'm very disappointed that I
couldn't contribute to this team
today. I was so out of step, my tim-
ing was just off out there.“

“When we played them at Pitt,
Andre Williams hurt us," Wildcat
guard Frank Dobbs said. “So today
we had to make the adjustment. We
trapped down in the corner
dpfpnci\/Phi "

Villanova worked on several de-.
fensive strategies in the first halfand
decided in the second half to stick
with their I-3-l zonetrap, which cer-
tainly worked on Williams, who hit
just one bucket from the field.

“We played lackadaisically early
on," Wildcat point guard Gary
McClain said, “making them think
they could play with us."

Pitt did look like they could play
with the Wildcats for quite a while in
the first half and trailed by a single
point, 27-26, at intermission.

“l think they packed it [their zone
defense] in, and I got caught under
the basket," Pinckney said.

Pinckney was held to just four
points in two-for-eight shooting in
the first half.

“We felt fairly good going into the
locker room,” Chipman said. “But
in the second half, we were forced to
go with a make-shift lineup because
of the foul trouble."

Armstrong was plagued through-
out the second half by the foul trou-
ble that was going around. He
picked up three in the first half and
was forced to sit out for over ﬁve
minutes after he picked up his fourth
foul with l5:09 to go.

Aside from the foul difficulty,
Armstrong hit 7 for 7 from the field,
totalled lo points and polished the
glass seven times in his 30 minutes of
play.

In many ways, yesterdays perfor-
mance mirrored this season of
inconsistency for the Panthers, who
currently sit at I6-l2 for the season.
The team had beaten St. John's, Vil-
lanova, Illinois State and Florida
State but also had great difficulty
throughout the season, even in ﬁnd-
ing a lineup that worked.

Pitt entered the Big East season.
with a 9-l record and high hopes.
Now they wait patiently until Sun-
day night to find out if they will
receive a bid to the National Invita-
tion tournament.

semifinals

According to Mullin, the key to
beating the Hoyas will be control.

“We hope to play a tempo game
and keep the score in the fifties or
mid-sixties," Mullin said. “We just
don't want to let them get the steam-
roller going."

The Georgetown-St. John's con-
test will start at 9 p.m. and will fol-
low the semifinal contest between
Syracuse and Villanova, which is
scheduled for a 7 p.m. tipoff.

over Pitt in yesterday's opening
round of the Big East conference
tournament.

Addison finished with 31 points,
just one point shy of the tournament
record, shared by Seton Hall’s Dan
Callandrillo [1980] and Boston Col-
lege’s John Garris [I983].

The 6-7 Addison shat I0 for 19
from the floor and a perfect II for l I
from the free throw line to advance
the Orangemen into the semi-finals
at Madison Square Garden. He
added seven rebounds and four
blocked shots. Addison scored I9 of

Syracuse's 38 first-half points.

Connecticut got as close as six
points with 7: 16 to play in the game,
but Addison connected on a 12-foot
baseline jumper and followed that
up with a I6-footjump shot from the
wing to put the Orange safely ahead
by l0._ '

Connecticut used a diamond-and-
one defense; hoping to stop the
Orangemen’s« freshman Dwayne
‘Pearl? Washington and thereby
slow the Oranges‘ running game.
Washingtomfinished with I3 points
but_ was not a factor.

‘ “In think Dwayne scores off of our
breaks," Syracuse head coach Jim
Boeheim said. “I don’t think he is
that important in our half-court
offense.

“We play very good half-court
offense," Boeheim said of a team
that has consistently been among the
nation's top in scoring, a team whose
reputation is built on a high-ﬂying
offense. “Our best games have been
against teams that slow us down and
play zones."

“They were stopping_me from get-

ting the ball," Washington said, “sol
tried to get Raf [Addison] in a posi-
tion to score.”

Addison, who has been shadowed
all year by the attention given
Washington, took full advantage of
his opportunity.

“I like to shoot in clutch situa-
tions," Addison said. “lfl can't play
against the best in crucial situations,
then I shouldn’t be playing.”

“Statistically speaking, I don't
know if there is a better player this
year,” Boeheim said of Addison.

Syracuse faces Villanova at 7 p.m.
tonight in the semi-final opener. The
two teams split during the regular
season, Syracuse winning the first
game 79-70 at the Carrier Dome and
the Wildcats rebounding at the
Palestra with a 77-75 victory.
Washington led all scorers in both
games with totals of 28 and 27.

“He had big numbers against us,”
remembered Villanova guard Gary
McClain. “You're going to have to
play straight up defense against him
and camouﬂage the court with our
many defenses.”

Addison, not the Pearl,   leads Orangemen

Total numbers vary, but Villan-
ova players attest to possessing as
many as 30 different defensive sets.

“We would like to keep the game
under 70 [points]," said Villanova
head coach Rollie Massimino. “I
think we will be much more relaxed
tomorrow night.

“At this stage in the season, the
most important thing is for us to
play our game."

That will translate into spmehow
getting the ball inside to forward-
/center Ed Pinckney, who finished
yesterday’s game with 21 points and
I2 rebounds.

“They [Syracuse] are a fairly
quick team,” Pinckney said. “I will
have to work hard to receive the
ball."

Pinckney, Addison and seven
other players on the two teams will
be playing in front of the home folks
at Madison Square Garden. “Easy
Ed," as the Villanova fans call the
Bronx, N.Y. native, likes’ that
feeling.

“This is a special time and place to
be playing basketball,” Pinckney
said.

One key to the game will be the

play of Villanova guard and Pitts-
burgh native Frank Dobbs, a 6-4
senior and graduate of Allderdice
High School.
' “We wanted to come out today
and prove that we were deserving of
the NCAA," Dobbs said. “Everyone
in college basketball is tired this time
of year. Whoever is more mentally
tough will win.”

Tonight, whoever is more men-
tally tough will most likely be
rewarded with a seed in one of the
NCAA tournament brackets.

“We were in the tournament
before todays game even started,“
Boeheim said. “Now we're ﬁghting
for a seed.”

Panthers
shutout

Maryville

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

It was a pleasant opener for the
Panther tennis team yesterday as
Pitt shut out Maryville, a Division
III team from Knoxville, 9-0 in the
first game of a tour of Tennessee.

Panther head coach George Dief-
fenbach believes this match was an
excellent opportunity to give some
work to a starting lineup that has
four freshmen.

“It was a perfect type of match to
start the season,” Dieffenbach said.
“It gives us the chance to work on
skills and gain some confidence."

But Dieffenbach would not go as
far as calling Maryville, whose
record dropped to 0-2, a patsy.

Panthers

  

ready for
NCAA tale

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

This weekend will tell the tale for
three members of the Pitt men’s
track team as they travel to Syracuse
to compete in the NCAA indoor
track and field championships.

Leading the Panthers will be jun-
ior hurdler Roger Kingdom, gold
medalist in the Pan—Am games last
summer, and defending champion in
the l00—meter hurdles outdoors.
Kingdom is the No. l seed in this
weekend’s gathering, having earned
the ranking with a time of7.02 in the
hurdles earlier in the season.

“Roger is ranked No. I," said
Coach John Vasvary, “but it has to
be done on that day. There are three
or four people who will really give
Roger a race."

Also representing the Panthers in
Syracuse will be senior Todd Colas.
Colas, at one point in the season.
had the fastest collegiate time in the
l,000—meter run, but since then has
been bumped down to third. Colas,
if prepared, should be a strong con-
tender for the title in the race in
which he placed seventh last March.

Garland Brown will compete in the 800-meter run this “Todd is in the top Six or eight in

- - - , the race,” said Vasvary. “Todd isn’t
weekend at the NCAA indoor track championships. just up against other/,_mericans,but

it is really an international meet with

all ofthe foreigners involved. He will
_ be in for a real tough race.”
Garland Brown will wear the blue
_ and gold for Pitt in the 800-meter

run. Brown, who qualified for the
national meet at the Big East indoor

championships three weeks ago,
may have the toughest race ofany of
the Panthers.

. I “Garland will have his hands full.
He is in the top 12 in the country,"

Vasvary said.

The distance medley relay team of
Colas, Brown, Tim Manes and Bill
I I I Moorhead also had qualified for the

meet, but had to withdraw when
scheduling conflicts kept Brown and
Colas from competing. The relay

" team had the third fastest time ofthe
 T  I. season on the way into the

championships.

For seniors Colas and Brown, this
is the last shot for an indoor crown.

Panther gymnasts ready to rocket

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

The Panther gymnasts take their
I3-2 record to Slippery Rock State

(‘ollege to face the Rockets tonight. _

After dropping only their second
meet of the season to Ohio State, the
Panthers are looking forward to this
meet to boost their confidence. The
Panthers hit their routines against
the Buckeyes, but Ohio State was
too strong a team for the Panthers.

“This is the last away meet for the
seniors, so we are dedicating this one
to them,” head coach Frank
I)’Amico said. “If we do the job we
did against Ohio State, we‘ll get bet-
ter than our usual scores.”

The seniors competing in their last
away meet are Dave Smith and

Pitt aces

Maryville

continued from page eighteen

“They weren‘t as weak as the score
indicates," he said. “They gave us
some good matches. We had to push
hard and play well to win, but they
are a Division III school. You can’t
expect them to play as well as a Div-
ision I team."

One area which stood out for Pitt
was the overall play in singles, where
none of the matches went over two
sets. The Panthers‘ No. 1 player
Dave Johnson defeated Maryville‘s
Mike Hill 6-4, 6-3. No. 2 Larry Led-
erer beat Martin Palucka 6-0, 6-2,
and No. 3 Jack Kalla won over Dave
Raulersun 6-2, 6-3.

It was in the lower seeds that the
Panthers dominated. Paul Rodri-
quez, Pitt’s No.4 player, had an easy
time with Chin Nwhan Cho 6-1. 6-0,
while Rich Monteleone and Chuck
DeVera, the No. 5 and 6 players,
shutout Maryville’s Ouy Huynh and
Glenn Stout 6-0. 6-0.

“Look at our strength in our
lineup,“ Dieffenbach said. “Our one
through six players are equal. This
shows we have a very uniform team.
It helps to have a balance because
you gain points when you play
teams.“ I

The place where Pitt needs
improvement is in the doubles play.

“I was more pleased with singles
than doubles," Dieffenbach said.
“We were not as aggressive, but that
comes when you gain confidence.
The more we play. the more confi-
dence we'll get.”

And that is the reason Pitt istour-
ing Tennesse; to rack up some play-
ing time. Today, the Panthers face
Tennessee-Chattanooga in a quad
meet. Tomorrow, the squad faces
Travecchia College and Middle Ten-
nessee State.

While the weather in Knoxville
was not ideal for tennis --— tempera-
tures in the 40s with windy condi-
tions -—- it was better than a

snowstorm in Western Pennsylva-
ma.

Frank Kratz. Both have qualified
for the NCAA championships in
their stay at Pitt and have been
named to the All-East team.

I Kraty, who earlier this season
pulled a muscle in his arm, is back in
form. He did a goodjob last week at
Ohio State, which was the first time
he competed in the all-around since
being injured. He tallied a score of
53.40.

“I’ve got to get my arm through

this meet this weekend, which
shouldn’t be too tough," said Kratz.

Meanwhile, Smith will see some
familiar faces at Slippery Rock
tonight.

“In the meet, I’ll be competing
against some of my former high
school teammates,” he said. “We’Il
be looking for scores to get us into
Nationals. This shouldn’t be a close
meet. Our depth is stronger than
theirs. Their fifth man [the first com-
petitor in each event] scores are
really low."

Tonight‘s meet will probably give
a tuneup for future competition.

“This meet will give us a good
indication of how we will be next
week against Penn State,” said jun-
ior Ed Miller. “There is not as much
pressure this week. We’ll be able to
swing freer."
