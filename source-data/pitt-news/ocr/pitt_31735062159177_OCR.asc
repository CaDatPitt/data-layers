Wherein We Explain

That Even Presidents
Can Write . . . Books
By OSCAR GOODSTEIN

Our President has been ac-
cused of turning commercial.
Before he was inaugurated, Mr.
Roosevelt’ wrote a book term-
ed, “Looking Forward;” since
then and very recently he has
published two other books. The
“backbiters” insist that this is
commercialism unbecoming the
leader of national destinies.

It seems that the occusers did
not consider that Mr. Roosevelt
may have talents beyond those
needed to guide the affairs of
state. Many other great world
leaders, George Clemencau, Ar-
istide Briand, Winston Churchill,
and Lloyd George have written
books prolifically, and could just
as easily have been accused of
capitalizing on their reputations.
Yet they were not.

Dignity Still Intact

Certainly there is nothing in
the President’s publications that
detract from the dignity of his
position. The action itself may
just as easily be recognibed as an
exposition of sincere beliefs and
theories as an attempt to com-
mercialize by merely using the
name Franklin Delano Roosevelt
on a book cover. The former
suposition is, I believe, the accu-
rate one.

The President’s mother has
been charged with a commercial
endorsement. But then the Presi-
dent’s mother is a kindly looking
old woman, and a symbol of
American Motherhood. Why not
have her picture on cereal boxes
at which American children will
be gazing every morning? I am
sure she did not endorse this pro-
duct because she needed the sti-
pend which she received for it.
In fact, I am not sure she took
the money.

Mrs. R. Writes A Column

The President’s wife has been
writing a daily column for a
newspaper syndicate; her life
story appeared in recent issues of
a woman’s magazine——the book
has been published; many other
activities add to her personal in-
come. But every cent of these
earnings has been donated to
charities and charitable institu-
tions.

The President’s son, James,
serves as his father’s private sec-
retary. Since the job carries with
it immense responsibilities, we
cannot say that he does not earn
the salary credited to him on that
account.

Before he accepted this position
he sold insurance policies that
ranked with the largest ever sold
in this country. Those who ana-
lyze this “undesirable commercial
situation” use the following ter-
minology to color their accusa-
tions: “Son Jimmy sold the big
boys insurance because they hoped
that Papa would do something for
them some day.”

Was Ethel Influenced

We cannot say that his father’s
position did not create opportu-
nity for James, or that a realiza-
tion of who the insurance sales-
man was did not sway more than
a few prospective buyers; but it
is another matter whether or not
son James deliberately used his
own or his father’s position to
force the sale of insurance.

It seems as silly to say that
James sold insurance by brandish-
ing his father’s name in‘ front of
customers, as it would be to say
that son Franklin, Jr., used it in
his suit for the hand of Ethel
du Pont. After all these children
of the President have their abili-
ties, emotions, and personalities
as well as any of us.

The biggest argument is that
the President and his family have
detracted from the dignity of the
supreme executive office. I think
that as long as Mr. Roosevelt
does, or attempts to (as you will
have it) keep us moving “On Our
Way,” critics can Well put this
minor charge of commercialism
in its own negligible place.

Cass Announces °

Choice Of Guard
For C&G Show

Yes, Mr. Beachler, Dante Dalle-
Tezze IS featured in the role of
Dictator in this year’s Cap and
Gown show!

Edwin Beachler, whose train-
ing as editor of The Pitt News
last year has taught him to spot
a story before it is news, announc-
ed in Monday’s Pittsburgh Press
that Dalle-Tezze mighty Panther
guard, has been cast in “Pickets,
Please.” And, of course, like all
Beachler . copy, the story is
“straight goods.”

Dalle-Tezze, who ﬁnished his

third year last season as guard on

the Pitt football squad, will play
the part of Bellini, Dictator of
Asphyxia, and wager of undeclar-
ed wars.

Rehearsing for three hours ﬁve
nights a week (not in the Hagan
plan), Dalle-Tezze reports: “It’s
plenty tough!”

“Football practice has nothing
on these rehearsals. When we get
through late at night, I’m ready
for the showers.

“Not that there is much physical
strain about rehearsing. It just
wears you out generally.

“But it’s a lot of fun and I get
a big kick out of it,” he adds.

Dalle-Tezze was recruited for
the show when associate director
Cass found that he needed a die-
tator with a cast-iron vocal cord.

Director Gene Kelly likes the
idea, too. “Every time Dalle-
Tezze booms, ‘I am dictator!’ six
of the boys in the chorus wake
up,” says Kelly.

Tea Monday

“Should auld acquaintances be
forgot—and days of Auld Lange
Syne.”

This theme welcomes you to
come drink tea, renew old ac-
quaintances, and chat with new
friends in the Commons Room
Monday afternoon from 3 to 5
o’clock.

The tea is a new social activity
to be held weekly in the Commons
Room under the sponsorship of
Mrs. J. K. Miller, hostess of the
Commons Room. According to
Mrs. Miller, the purpose of the
Commons Room is to serve as a
meeting place for all students, not
merely certain groups of students.

“What the old landing in Alum-
ni Hall was to yesterday’s stu-
dents,” says Mrs. Miller, “so the
Commons Room is to today’s.”

Following up the \Vasser-

ed, the health services, according

, -to a joint statement from Dr. H.

C. Carlson, director of the men’s
student health service, and Dr.
Auleene M. Jamison, director at
the women’s health service, be-
lieve that the anti—tuberculosis
tuberculin test will be more along
actual health lines since it is ex-
pected that many students in the
University will show positive re-
actions to the tuberculin tests.

All men’s tests will be taken at
Fall; Clinic, the men’s health
service on Fifth avenue. Women’s
tests will be given at the women’s
health service on the eighth floor
of the Cathedral. Tuberculin ap-
plications will be made by Dr.
Carlson and Dr. Paul Zehfuss at
the men’s clinic, and Dr. Jamison
at the women’s.

Though the Wassermann tests
of last fall were easy to take, the
tuberculin test is comparatively
much simpler. There is no with-
drawal of blood, no blood analysis.

Both the men’s and the W0-
men’s health services will begin
taking tuberculin tests at 9 o’clock

‘Which’Honors
Are Distributed

U T’S THEIR day today. Once a year. that
. group of individuals who through their et-
forts have done outstanding work _in the va-
rious scholastic ﬁelds at the University are rec-
ognized at Scholars’ Tap Day.  "
: In many instances the names of today ’s scliol-
ars will be identical to the names of the tap-
pees at .Act.ivit‘ies Tap Day on AP1‘11_ 29- In
other cases the two groups will "be divergent.

In congratulating the students to be honored
this morning, it is well to remember that they
represent what‘ is considered the best in scholar-
ship at the University, and thus ‘standing ‘for
the prime objective of an educational institu-
tion, deserve their honors.

"We might go on in our congratulations to
add the time-honored platfitude that the stu-
dents who are honored as scholars will have
soinethiiig far more intrinsic than the citations
which they will receive from the platform to-
day, that by their surpassing scholarship they
will be happier and more useful human beings.

But we’d rather end this little piece with a
bit of whimsical sentinieiitz wc’re glad that, in
the press of activities and university life, we
can still ﬁnd a representative group of scliol—
ars whom .we can honor for work well done.

SFA Must Stalemate
Chess Propagandists

HE executive committee of SFA will soon
have another opportunity to exercise its
good judgment on the merits of campus organ-
izations. The Chess club is petitioning for
recognition. V
In line with SFA’s policy of not granting
recognition to propagaiidist groups, as in the
recent case of the American Student Union, it
would deﬁnitely be subverting the future of
education here if this club were allowed to con-
tinue its activitie: in talkie opin. ’

 

Consider these "aspects of the question: 

(1) No need exists for a‘. formal organiza-
tion. Chess is a. highly individualistic game;
collective action is not necessary. If a. team
must be gathered to play another school,
someone can easily gather up all the players
needed, in the Tuck Shop and other hangouts.

(2) The philosophy of chess, its strategy
and tactics are foreign and uii-American.
Most of its fundamental precepts are taught
by foreigners, like Alekhin, the Russian;
Lasker, the German. We don’t want these
alien “isms” on our campus, do we‘?

(3) Playing chess matches may easily be
used as a. blind for radical discussion. What
is to prevent the members from discussing‘
the social revolution and the coming struggle
for power over their chess boards? .

(4) Finally, the purpose of the club is ad-
mittedly to spread interest in chess, to propa-
gandize a. game deﬁnitely not indigenous to
America, one which cultivates thinking in
terms of sly gambits and slinky traps.

=X< =X= 5:?

This is a crucial decision for SFA. It must
keep faith with precedent and established rules
of order and refuse recognition.

Otherwise, it will soon be on the short path
to decay and disintegration, the ultimate fate
of all institutions and civilizations which have
weakened and forgotten the lessons of the past.

War And Peace Forces
Working In World

ECENT developments in international poli-

‘§» tics are giving new color and added signi-

 ance t'o the United State ’s position with re-
gard to world peace.

This country’s peace policy has centered
around consideration of the relative expediency
of stepping into the international arena to help
tame the “mad—dog” nations . . . Japan, and
Germany . . . or preserving strict and undeviat'—
ing neutrality. This assumes that the United
States is in a position to remain aloof, and to
choose a peace policy solely on the basis of
expediency.

It is generally admitted that the ideal posi-
tion is not so much isolation as it immunity
from the war-provoking aspects of internation-
al politics.

Opponents to the idea of collective security
also oppose President Roosevelt/s demands to
“quarantiiie the aggressor nations.” They be-

The peace sentiment. in the United States,

enough to cope with jingoist propoganda in the

There is a basis for peace, however, in the
simple fact that war is not general; that pres-
ent wars are speciﬁc ones; that if these wars
are stopped, the war menace will be postponed,
and that in the various programs of collective
security, and world-wide opposition to, and sen-

enough strength to stop present wars and post-

\Ve must not be too hasty in condemning the latest purges
in the U. S. S. R. Too much publicity of a. sensational nature
has been given to the trial of the 21 treason-accused men, a trial
which is really none of our business.

It is a crisis of the Russian state, dealt with by the Russians,
and dealt‘ with in a. l'llaIlIl€I'.\Vlll.Cll is by no means new in history.

Russia has undergone a _rcvoliition which has lifted it bodily

civilization into a state of civ-

bound to be opposition to the po-
litical group which has effected
this change. Andwhen the oppo-
sition is as serious and ;dangerous
as that type _.persoiiified by the 12
men who are now on trial, there

‘LOGICAL CONFESSIONS‘

been carried on with efﬁciency

‘NO FATALISM’

Two of Russia’s leading physic-
ians tell with details, even with
eagerness, how they killed Maxim
Gorki by overdosing with stimu-
lants, how they knocked off his
son by getting him drunk often.
You can’t ascribe these confes-
sions to the Oriental fatalism .
which is part of the Russian char-
acter. That’s too easy.

And then another defendant, the
only one of this dozen, states in
open court that the confession he
gave previously was untrue and
forced and then on the next day
changes his mind, asserting posi-
tively that they were true—you
don’t know what to think.

The discoverer of the explana-
tion for this would win the Pul-
itzer prize, hands down.

But in any case, whether the al-
leged conspirators are guilty or
whether they are not guilty, the
trials are a severe indictment of
what was called a Workers’ father-
land, to which radicals could
point and say “There is a socialist
government in actual operation.”

SOMETHING ‘SCREWY’

Implicated as conspirators have
been the president of ﬁve out of
the seven constituent republics of
the USSR, the entire general staff,
the admirals of the ﬂeet, the head
of the Communist international,
the editors of the assorted tech-
nicians and politicos.

If all these men, “ﬁnanced by
German and Italian gold,” direct-
ed by the tremendous organiza-
tional
couldn’t effect a coup d’etat in a
period of more than ten ’years——-
something is screwy.

It may. be that Stalin can be jus-

are the natural outcome of total-

self.

Just A Few
.Ideas

By LEONARD LEVISON

If it weren’t for a. deadline
that looms ﬁve minutes away
from this writing, there are any
number of themes that might
make a substantial column. As
it ‘is, all we can do in the limited
time»:-»is pose the ideas. At least
they may be worth thinking about.

‘REPUBLICAN POT - SHOT—
Reports that both Pinchot and

nor, isn’t very
difficult to fath-
om. Who would-
n’t want one of
t h e district’s
m o s t popular
and most re-
spected citizens
on the same ticket?

The whole situation should have
one particularly pleasing aspect to
those who have an interest in col-
legiate athletics. That is the fact
that the singling out of Sutherland
has more signiﬁcance than being
just a Vote-getting move. It is rec-
ognition of the transference of
training values from the ﬁeld of
athletics to another ﬁeld. It shows
a crystallization of public opinion
behind the fact that in the proper
environment, athletics are a deﬁn-
ite education themselves.

WEEK-END — Beginning today
and by the time Saturday is over,
every Pitt winter team will have
been in some sort of competitive
action. The last big week-end, a
few weeks back, of the winter sea-
son was not so fruitful. On that
occasion, only the swimmers came
out ahead. The boxers, trackmen,
and basketballers experienced a
blue Monday.

Prospects for this week-end are
not the same. Our predictions call
for the annexation of- the Eastern
Swimming Championship by the
Panthers, a basketball second
place as the cagers take good care
of Sleepy Glenn’s Mountaineers,
and a ring victory over inexper-
ienced Bucknell. a

Carl Olson’s trackmen will run
second to Notre Dame, with a slight
chance of Pitt edging ahead by
one-half point. The wrestlers will
grunt. That’s all. "

Olson’s fears have been increas-
ing since last’Wednesday.

Last Wednesday he prepared
for tomorrow’s Central Intercolle-
giates at South Bend, fearing only
the might of Notre Dame’s track
squad. However, he’s heard that
Marquette and Drake also have a
couple of good teams entered, and
so now he has to split his fears up
to include these two teams.

TEN MEN G0

’The other twelve teams entered
are mysteries to Olson, and like
every other human being (track
coaches are human beings) he

worries and fears my_steries. To
assuage‘ his fears Olson will take
a "ten-man" team up to South Bend.
’Frank Ohl, Al McKee, Al Fer-
rara, Johnny Woodruff, -Captain
Dick Mason, John Bayzk, Ed
Routch, Frank Kristl, George
Clifton, Bud Hafer, and Pete Ben-
net will make the trip. In addi-
tion to the Vmile relay Johnny
Woodruﬁ will trotthe‘ half mile
and quarter mile.
McKEE IN 440" M
Ohl will enter the sprints and
broad jump, McKee will try-for
points in
handle the sprints, and Kristl will
compete in the low hurdles.
Bayzk and Hafer will enter the
shot put, Clifton is slated for the
pole vault, Routch will try for a
ﬁrst in the broad jump, and Pete
Bennet will re-enter competition
via the highjump.

Ready for its last conference¢
dual match before the champion-
ships, the Pitt boxing team is aim-
ing to add another victory to a
successful season by taking on an
up-coming Bucknell team at Lew-
isburg tomorrow evening.

PITT FAVOREDA

Captained and coached by Wal-
ter Ballard and Joe Reno, respec-
tively, the Bison sluggers are
given the underdog rating.

The Lewisburg boys boast a
conference champ, a former con-
ference titleholder and several
seasoned veterans in their roster.

In the 125—weight, the Bison
representative will be Steve
Stephanou. Steve was confer-
ence champ in his sophomore
year, ﬁghting in the 115 class, but
additional weight has made the
going a little tough for him.

When Ralph Caruso enters the
ring against Bill Androski, he will
have to snap the streak of bad
luck which has bound him down
all season. Androski is the con-
ference champ in this class and
annexed it in his sophomore year.

LOCAL BOY

Pitt’s Ralph Dorand, 115, will
tackle Richard Brown, a ﬁrst year
man whose only previous boxing
experience was on the freshman
squad.

A local lad, Walter Ballard,
hailing from Mt. Lebanon, will
try to bring home the bacon for
the Bisons. He will tangle with
Jed Curzi in the 145 division.

A portside slugger, Bucknell’s
Dick Reider, will see action
against Johnnie Neuner or Ray
Bombe, 155. Reider has been
very inconsistent, but is not to be
taken too lightly.

KNOCKOUT STAR

Pitt when Frank Funair, a soph-

West Virginia has consistently
maintained a “nothing on the ball”
form all year. They have fallen
before every Conference mem--
ber, including Pitt, on the Stadi-
um boards, January 29, in a so-so
shooting party. In their apolo-
getic ﬁnale the local courtmen
can clinch the Eastern. Confer-

A1 Beacon, Panther 150—yard
backstroke star, faces another de-
fending champ, Grunert, whom he
has already defeated earlier in the
season. Grunert may wind up in
third should Al Slobodian have a
good night and add second place
to the Pitt point total.

NOWOTNY ONLY TITLIST

Walt Nowotny is the only
Panther defending a title, the 100-
yard dash, and Miller of F. & M.
who has been beating all comers
may part Nowotny and his title.
Miller is adso favored to take care
of the 50-yard sprint.

The diving toga, which is held
by the now graduated Jack Mc-
Qillan of Pitt, may remain in the
same trophy case. Bill Brown
will cut jack-knives with Deith
of Rutgers for the decision in div-
ing. _

The scramble for second and
thirds will settle the meet win-
ners. Thus far the Panther squad
has been able to bolster their
capture of ﬁrsts with liberal
sprinklings of seconds and thirds.
With every man on the Pitt squad
a potential point getter, Corr’s
team should garner enough points
to stay among the undefeated
swimming teams.

Wrestlelfsp End
S=ca.so11=Against
Mountaineers

In a last attempt to salvage at
least one win from a miserable
season, Coach Mazaski takes his
Panther wrestlers to Morgantown
tomorrow night to meet West
Virginia.

The record of the two teams in-
dicate that Mazeski has little
chance of even. doing this, for the
Mountaineers have won four of
their seven meets.

Highlights of the West Virginia
season were wins over Case and
Temple. Both of these teams
walked away from the Panthers.

Captaining the West Virginians
will be footballer Hodges, who
wrestles as a heavyweight. Frank
Kristufek, Pitt heavy, will oppose
him. If Frank continues to show
the form his displayed at Waynes—
burg, he should give Hodges a
had nine minutes, or less.

Pitt Captain Rudy Tommarelli
is wrestling his last regular match
for the Panthers, .and will meet
Lancaster, tri—state 135-pound
champ. ’

Another Mountaineer headliner
is 118-pounder Stillwell, who
tangles with the long-suffering
Bill Hoeveler.

There are three cripples on the
Pitt roster at present. Kristufek
has a sprained ankle, a holdover
from football season, Kosinski
sprained his back in the Waynes—
burg meet, and Clem Gambal has
several strained muscles in his
chest. They will all ﬁght, never-
theless‘.

This afternoon 15 women will
set out for Laurel Ridge, where
they will participate in outdoor

Publications, Cap, Gown Offices

Submit To Reconstruction Move

Eighth ﬂoor activities expe-
rienced a reconstruction move that
was completed in little more than
one hour.

Formerly occupying a large and
a smaller interior office in 832
Cathedral. The News Wednesday
found that it had been removed
from its small executive office, and
been gratuitously presented with
the former Panther office.

The Panther was also astonish-
ed to awaken in 801 after having
emitted its last growls from the
vicinity of 804. But the greatest
astonishment was evidenced by

Cap and Gown, which has been
transferred from 801 to the expan-
sive emptiness of 828.

The News was also privileged
in witnessing the swiftest con-
struction job ever performed on
the Frick Acres. Consuming the
total time of one hour, ten min-
utes and 25 seconds, the building
and grounds men removed a 20-
foot wall separating 832 from the
corridor, converted the corridor
into part of 832, and erected a ten-
foot wall separating 832 from its
former parent, The News oﬂ‘ice.

Phi Delts Celebrate
F ounder’s Day

Preparations are in full swing
for :1 Phi Delt feast tomorrow
night as the brothers plan to
celebrate their Founder’s Day
banquet at 6:30 at the PAA.

After-dinner speaker for the
occasion will be Dean Hoffman,

cil of Phi Delta Theta. Dele-
gates from the Allegheny, Wash-
ington and Jefferson, West Vir-
ginia, and Penn State chapters
are expected to attend the fes-
tivities, as well as lots of alums
from Pittsburgh and vicinity.

Rumor has it that the local
boys are also planning ‘ a big
welcome for Brother Paul Pen-
darvis, that swing-smoothie from
California whom you may have
heard about recently. He’s a.
Phi Delt, too, ordid you know?
