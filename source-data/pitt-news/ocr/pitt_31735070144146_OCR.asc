Though football players might not
agree, Tyler McGaughey believes the
ideal weather for a football game is 50
degrees with light rain.

And although it might make for slip-
pery conditions for the Panthers, it’s per-
fect for the Pitt  Band’s smoke
machine,which thegsoupuses tomake
its grand entrance onto Heinz Field be-
fore every home game

"Ihe smoke is one of the main rea-

Fraternity and sorority members

of off—campus greek housing

SGB members of ﬁatemities and
sororities, such as Ryan Haddad,.Perry
Servedio and Francee Varner, drove
many of the questions and wore the
letters of their organizations along with
board members Ryan Very and Gary
Sanderson.

. Inter—Fraternity Council vice presi-
dent Nick Dell’Omo asked SGB to
address the problem of 11 fraternities
without on—campus housing.

The greeks’i' concerns largely fo-
cused on off—campus housing for ﬁa-

Iacee Ecker called for SGB to form a
cornrrrittee to research the issue

leaders from offrampus fraterni-

city and University ordinances apply

said Rustin. “There are just some
thingswecan’ttakeback, andabullet
is one of them.”

Fifty-ﬁve out of 69 homicides that
Pittsburgh’s Bureau of Police faces
tight now are gun—related, said Rustin,
who spoke to students in the Bureau’s

- Citizens’ Police Academy on Monday.

Rustin works in the Firearms

such as homicides. .
Before  in. her current

years in the Bureau’s homicide depart-

ficer for 22 years
She said that more than 1,000 guns

per year are recovered in Pittsburgh, .

and the vast majority of those guns
can be traced back to an owner whose

gun was lost or stolen.

Currentiy, Pennsylvania law doesn’t
require gun owners to report a 
or stolen gun And that has dangerous
repercussions, Rustin said.

A “It’s more than just  — it’s
changing the people who aren’t in the
wrong place at the wrong’ timea It’s
people who are the vi ' s,” said Rus-
tin.

Alcohol-free Fridays

by Caitlin Kasunich
Stzzﬁ’ Writer

As the lights softly ‘dimmed
over the blush—colored chalk-
board, seven students tiptoed
through the arched, brown door-
way. The faint hum ‘of the heater
blanketed their footsteps, and a
blue‘ screen ﬂickered at the front
of the room. Two violins harmo-
nized during the film’s opening
credits, mufﬂing whispers at the
Obscure Movie Group’s meeting.

But just down the street in a
warehouse-like theater, students

laughed loudly. A blonde man-

skipped wildly across the center
of the stage as a slim, brunette

' woman performed a cartwheel

near the audience. The Friday Nite
Improvs’ first skit of the evening
forced cackling students to dab
tears from their eyes.

The Obscure Movie Group
also ,holds meetings on Friday
nights, exposing about 20 to 30 of
its 350 members to relatively un-
known movies from around the
world.

These two clubs have some-
thing in common: alcohol-free
entertainment.

Movies instead of parties
Shanna Murphy, the vice presi-
dent and co-founder of the or-
ganization, said she believes that
the Obscure Movie Group is a
good alternative for students who
-choose not to go out and party
on the weekends. Students who
come to the movie group have the
opportunity to meet people who
share similar interests. .
“I’Ve met many people who
have found friends through going
to meetings together, and I think
rhat’s great,” she said. “Whether or
not they go to parties afterwards
is a different story, but if you go
home after the movie, at least.you
did something on Friday night.”
Matt Carrick, the president and
co-founder of the Obscure Movie
Group, said that the movies are
good despite their obscurity.
“We show foreign movies and

‘really horrible movies that are so-

bad they’re good,” said Carrick. “A
lot of the stuff is pretty weird, but
we try to intersperse those kinds
of movies with funny and cool
ﬁlms. Mostly, the films that we
show are really good but never got

Before showing “In The Mood

starring Maggie Cheung and Tony
Leung, Carrick quickly sorted out
black and white stickers with the
words, “OMG it’s the Obscure
Movie Group!” for the members
sitting patiently in front of him.
The Obscure Movie Group

- meets every Friday at 8 p.m., a busy

time for many college students, in
Room 1700 of "Wesley  Posvar

“This is the ﬁrst time I’ve been

Improvs give students a different kind of high

Alcohol-free, page 2

Studio Theatre in the basement of
the Cathedral of Learning, the Im-
provs open to the public at 10:45
p.m. and usually run until 1 a.m.

After paying $3 to cover the
cost of renting out the theater
from the University, more than
100 students and parents rushed
inside the theater to claim their
gray, cushioned seats.

Seven rows of studio lights
cast red and yellow hues against
the black, wooden walls and four
speakers that hung by silver chains
in each corner of the room.

Suddenly, a tall brown-haired
man raced into the middle of the
brown- and white-checkered ﬂoor
and introduced himself as “John
the host.” Although he is usually
the person who collects the mon-
ey at the door, he said, he took on
the task of running the show for
a night.

“Prepare for things that you’ll
never see again,” he said in a deep,
commanding voice. “It’s wonder-
ful and delicious, but‘ it’s also in-
sane.”

 

From acting out scenes from
Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” in
a morgue to deriving inner mono-
logues for two brothers at a bach-
elor party, the audience engaged in
a series of interactive games that
tested their improvisational skills.

“If you like to laugh, you will
like our show,” said Louis Stein,
one of the executive producers of
the Improvs and a former host of
the show. “It’s a wonderful time
and gives kids an alternative to
going to frat parties and getting
fake IDs. Having done it all when
I was young, I can tell you it’s a re-
ally cool alternative to ‘doing all of
those things.”

Stein, a 40-year-old network
administrator at Carnegie Mellon
University, said that although he
considers himself the “creepy old
guy” at the Improv, he has been
involved with the organization for
each of the 16 or 18 years it’s been
in production.

“The first time you get onstage
and do something and people
laugh with you, there’s nothing in

the world to compare to it,” said
Stein. “You can’t buy it in a bag
and drink it. There’s just no substi-
tute for that kind of hig .”

Stein first encountered the
Friday Nite Improvs as an under-
graduate at Pitt when he decided
to take the Introduction to Per-
formance course to bring up his
grade point average. The class syl-
labus required him to visit the Im-
provs at least once over the course
of the semester to learn about im-
provisation.

“I was stomping my feet going
there, but I was completely blown
away by the level of comedy,” he
said. “These weren’t paid perform-
ers. They were people that you sat
next to on the bus or passed on
the street, but they were doing
an exceptional level of comedy. I
wanted to see it again, and I even-
tually worked up the courage to
get onstage myself.”

Other options available
In addition to the Obscure

“Movie Group and the Friday Nite

Improvs, the Northway Oakland
Christian Community, located at
120 McKee Place, hosts alcohol-.,
free film festivals, Bible and book
studies and community service
opportunities for students who
live in or near Oakland.

‘‘It’s a healthy alternative to
focus on a community'that’s built
around something other than al-
cohol and destructive behaviors,”
said Mike Arnold, a pastor at the
church.

“Students can connect with
other individuals in a much health-
ier way by serving their city and
exploring their spirituality.”

Joe Mull, the coordinator of
the Office of Health Education
and Promotion and chair of the
Pitt’s Alcohol Task Force, agreed.

“As a society, we’ve been sold,
almost since birth, an image of
what college is supposed to be
like,” said Mull. “This image is that
college is a student’s last chance
for freedom, so they need to live
life at the extreme ends of irre-
sponsibility. This often manifests

itself in the form of high-risk al-
cohol use.”

The Alcohol Task Force works
with Pitt’s Division of Student
Affairs to plan an alcohol-free,
late-night social program each se-
mester. ,

Last spring, for example, more
than 400 students attended “Bowl-
ing and Bingo” in the basement of
the Pitt Alumni Association where
they bowled for free, played bingo,
ate food and won prizes. Also, last
fall, about the same number of
students enjoyed “Karaoke and
Late Night Pancakes” at Nordy’s
Place in the W/illiam Pitt Union.
The Alcohol Task Force and Pitt’s
Division of Student Affairs spon-
sored both events.

“Students need to figure out
for themselves the role that‘alco-
hol will play in their social lives,”
said Mull.

“Unfortunately, some students
come to rely on it as a catalyst for
their social success, which can ac-
tually become detrimental to their
success in the long run.”

: deserve a bailout

 These days it seems like every-
 body wants a bailout. The eco-
 nomic crisis has affected every
 corner of American commerce,
 from small-business owners to
 multinational corporations. For
the most part they’ve simply had
to recoup their losses and soldier
on. But one notable exception is
j the U.S. automobile industry.
With the argument that
 American automakers are too
 vital to the national economy to
 let them go bankrupt, the Big
 Three — General Motors, Ford
 and Chrysler —— have appealed
 to the federal government for
 help staving off bankruptcy in
 the face of slipping sales and the
 prospect of tens of thousands
 of auto workers without jobs.
9 And lawmakers appear to be
l listening. House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi has pledged to bring a vote
L before the House on whether to
3 give the Detroit companies fed-
 eral funds, and President—elect
; Barack Obama spoke Monday
 with President Bush about the
8 same matter.
J Unfortunately, what all these
5 people seem to be missing is
E the fact that, unlike a bailout of
3 the banking industry, bailing out
Detroit auto companies isn’t a
T permanent solution. It’s barely a
, solution at all. A
: Banks deal in the movement
1 and trade of money, so giv-
, ing them more money to oper-
. ate is all they need to shore up
5 their operations and get back
 on stable footing, assuming they
won’t gamble their loans on risky
'3 ﬁnancial schemes again. But giv-
J ing the Big Three more money
is only a stopgap measure at best
V that doesn’t change the fact that
2 the industry has been in trouble

 for the last 30 years.

U.S. auto companies simply
aren’t competitive on the world
stage anymore, to the point
where foreign—made cars outsell
American cars everywhere in the
world, including in the United
States. The rising costs of la-
bor and materials have driven
the prices of domestic autos up
faster than the competition, and
coupled with the sheer volume
of cars on the market, the Big
Three has slowly but inevitably
lost market share and value.

This isn’t to say that Detroit
makes bad cars, but that its good
cars cost more than equally good
cars from foreign auto compa-
nies, and people generally won’t
buy a more expensive product of
the same quality.

If the government gives
these companies bailouts — and
it looks very likely that it will -—
then lawmakers need to make
sure that these companies are
going to change their strategies
drastically in an effort to stay
competitive and turn a proﬁt.

It would be more admirable
for the government to take the
money and invest it in sustain-
able, environmentally friendly
public transportation systems,
alternative energy research and
other ﬁelds that actually have a
chance of beneﬁtting from gov-
ernment funds.

The U.S. auto industry is not
unique — it’s just big. The pros-
pect of these companies poten-
tially going bankrupt shouldn’t
change the principles of capi-
talism on which the American
economy is built, even if it means
sacriﬁcing some venerable com-
panies. Businesses go bankrupt
all the time for the same reasons;
why should these three be any
different?

Prop. 8 a step back for civil rights

by Giles Hovvard

Columniat

President—elect Barack Obama’s

: victory in the election has tightly

been identiﬁed as a milestone in the
history of American civil rights. His
campaign energized the histoiically
disenfranchised black community,
and his victory serves as a ﬁtting
culmination to the struggle of civil
tights leaders like Jesse Jackson,
Rosa Parks and Martin Luther 
Jr.

But although this nation broke
the color barrier of the White
House and defeated the racism of
our fathers, the passage of Propo-
sition 8 in California demonstrated
that the work of the civil rights
movement is far from over. '

Proposition 8, a ballot initiative

 passed on Tuesday with 52 percent
 of the vote, effectively banned gay

marriage in the state of California.
Gay mariiage had been legal in that
state since June 16, 2008, when a

California Supreme Court ruling"

took effect, overturning the state’s
gay-marriage ban.

Same—sex couples from around
the country who faced discrimina-

 

tion in their own states traveled to
California so their relationships
could receive the same legal and
public recognition as any hetero-
sexual relationship.

California, along with Connecti-
cut and Massachusetts, represented
a beacon of tolerance and progress
in a nation so deeply stained by dis-
ctimination.

But Tuesday, motivated by what
can only be described as bigotry, 52
percent of Californians voted to
topple the monument to progress
that California’s marriage laws had
become.

What’s worse is that black peo-
ple voted 2 to 1 in favor of Propo-
sition 8, guaranteeing its passage.
Not only is this shameful, it is also
incomprehensible.

Having reached the pinnacle
of the civil rights struggle, blacks
in California proved to be the key
voting bloc in denying civil rights to
another minority population in this
country. .

Where’s the outrage?

Where are the black civil rights
leaders decrying the passage of
Proposition 8 as the manifestation
of rank ignorance and bigotry that
it is? ' A

They are nowhere to be found.
Men such as Jesse Jackson, Al
Sharpton and Obama, who have all
beneﬁted from the progress of the
civil rights movement they helped
shape, have been silent on this is-
sue.

Rather than champion the civil
tights of one of this nation’s most
consistently victimized minorities,
leaders in the black community,
including our president-elect, have
remained silent on Proposition 8.

Regrettably, it appears that the
courage that characterized the
American civil rights movement of
the ’60s and ’70s is gone. Instead,
the religious values that informed
the teachings of men such as King
have been ‘perverted to deny Amer-
icans their fundamental rights.

Under the guise of religious val-
ues and the defense of “traditional
marriage,” homosexuals have once
again been legally discriminated
against at the behest of the major-
ity. T

It is time for the courts to step
in.

The same courts that ended

segregation when the people’s rep-
resentatives would take no actions
but to reaffirm segregation must

Posvar a. wonderland for schoolwork avoidance

  

by Ravi Pandit
Colum/zldt

 
 

After yet another marathon of
watching embarrassing TV shows
and making the least of my col-

lege experience, last week I decid-
ed that I better go pretend to hit
the books. You know, “study.”

So, I shaved, ironed my pants,
polished my shoes, threw some
snacks in my backpack, unburied
my books, loaded up my MP3
player with “study” music and
headed to one place I knew I’d
get a lot of “studying” done: Hill-
man Library.

Of course, I really don’t study
in Hillman. I don’t think any-
one does. But, because it is ﬁlled
with books and wooden tables, it
makes everyone feel studious just
to be there.

This sentiment explains why
I nearly soiled myself when I
arrived at the library. I walked
through the ground ﬂoor entrance
of Hillman and into a psychedelic
wonderland. I don’t know who

it was, but somebody went nuts
with a credit card at Home Depot
and decided to slap bright reds,
blues, yellows and greens all over
the library walls.

The University, it seems,
caught on to the Club Hillman
concept and, like an over-eager
parent trying to be hip, decided to
paint the library like a European
nightclub. '

Obviously, I couldn’t fake-
study in a place like this. The ro-
mance was just  gone. It wasn’t
fun anymore. And so it came to
pass that I wandered aimlessly
into Posvar Hall. Could Posvar
Hall ﬁll that void in my heart?
The answer depended on how
well I could fritter away my time
within its oddly-angled, Soviet-
style, mottled-brick walls.

Unlike Hillman, Posvar holds
more than just books: Posvar is
home to economics, the noblest
of all disciplines. Unfortunately,
the departments of psychology,
sociology, anthropology, political
science, history and other less-

than—taxing or made-up majors .

also call it home. So it’s the ideal

place to troll for cheerleaders,
athletes ' and trophy spouses. If
you’re lucky, you might even ﬁnd
econ hotties like myself.

No matter what your prefer-
ence, you certainly won’t be hurt-
ing your eyes scanning across
crowds of engineers or physics,
chemistry or biology majors for
that special someone. Posvar of-
fers social selection at its ﬁnest.

Just had your first date at Ein-
stein’s and want to seal the deal?
Posvar offers a floor space larger
than Hillman or even the Cathe-
dral of Learning, so you’ll always
have enough choices of dark cor-
ners and abandoned classrooms.

Unfortunately, navigating
through Posvar is a real—life Su-
doku, a complex puzzle combin-
ing winding turns, dead ends and
odd—shaped stairwells. Pick up
a muffin at Einstein’s and drop
some crumbs, or no one will ever
ﬁnd you or your “study buddy”
again. .
For the less adventurous, the
GSPlA/ Economics Library of-
fers the traditional stacks, with
the benefit that the library is al-

most always deserted.

If you aren’t looking for love
but just want to hang out, Pos-
var is the place for you. There
are dozens of dance and music
groups on campus, and almost
all of them practice in the Posvar
lobby.

Eschew your midterms for
a real lesson in salsa dancing, or
you can play the ever-entertaining
game of “Wait 20 Minutes for a
Printout” at the computer lab.

If you are overwhelmed by
your workload and want a good
excuse to skip your ﬁnals, you
could always stand hopefully
under the spiky sculpture-slash-
death trap hanging in the Lobby.
It’s all under one roof, folks. You
can even go across the walkway
and ﬁnd some law students or
freshmen to laugh at.

The downside to all this is that
Posvar is hideous, but don’t let the
extra dose of ugly fool you. No
mere hall could sprawl between
South Bouquet and Bigelow and
extend its tentacles into David
Lawrence Hall, the law school
and Towers Patio. No ordinary

building could open its door to
the masses stampeding inside to
escape the inclement Pittsburgh
weather.

., There’s a name for self-con-
tained units that house thou-
sands of people of workers and
highly trained experts, you know.
There’s a special term for places
that feature advanced computer
and communications centers,
conference rooms, eating areas,
extensive elevator and escala-
tor systems, security forces and
impregnable exteriors. They’re
called spaceships, and we’re lucky
enough to have one sitting right
on our campus.

And we can make it ours. We
can eschew the ﬂamboyant kin-
dergarten colors of Hillman and
the corrupt culture of “silence in
the library” in favor of Posvar,
where all things are possible.

Except actual studying.

ing all mfenre and non-science mayors,

now thwart public opinion and restore to
same-sex couples the right to marry, in the
state of California.

But that isn’t enough. The federal govern-
ment and the Obama administration, which
we are promised will be progressive, must
work to exercise change and bring rights to
homosexual Americans.

The religious organizations that supported
Proposition 8 must be stripped of their tax-

actively campaigned against the rights of ho-
mosexual Ameiicans must be sent a message
that if they choose to exercise political power,
they will be held accountable financially.
Also, Obama will have a number of op-
portunities‘ to appoint Supreme Court jus-
tices during his ﬁrst term in office. He must
use these opportunities to construct a Court
that, like the Warren Court of the civil rights
era, will be  to disregard the discrimina-

rights to homosexuals.

We cannot continue to pat ourselves on the
back and congratulate the American elector-
ate for electing a black man as long as homo-
sexuals are still legally discriminated against in
this country. Their struggle for rights must be
our struggle as well. Until all people in this
country are protected and respected by law,
no civil rights movement will be victorious.

Current Pitt students are probably too
young to actually remember the heyday of
classic rock.

By the time most college students were
born in the ’80s, rock ’n’ roll was more hair
metal than Hendrix, and though we likely
heard our dads jamming out to Zeppelin
and Lynyrd Skynyrd in the family van, we
never really got to experience it ﬁrsthand.

That is, until now. Tonight, two of the
biggest traditionalist rock ’n’ roll bands
around, the Drive-By Truckers and The
Hold Steady,  hit the Carnegie Library
Music Hall to raise the spirits of classic
Allman Brothers and Springsteen, respec-
tively.

W/hile The Hold Steady tap into the
driving guitar rock of The Boss at his ﬁn-

Scientists fascinated with alternative dimensions

by Donald Campbell
Colum/zidt
For some time,

science and science ﬁction have
been obsessed with the idea of
extra dimensions. ‘

It was a complete break-
through in scientiﬁc thinking
when Einstein proposed that
time could be considered a di-
mension rather than just a mys-
terious nature of the universe.
Science ﬁction’s obsession is un-
derstandable. .

As four-dimensional beings, it
is unfathomable that there might
be 11 dimensions —— as that new-
fangled string theory would have
you believe. What are these extra
dimensions? Are they a physical
reality, or are they just a math-
ematical curiosity? Case Western
Reserve University would like to
see if it can “see” the extra di-
mensions, according to a recent
article in ScienceDaily.

They want to see if they can
simulate a situation where the
extra dimensions are a physical

 

must.

The unfortunate dilemma fac-
ing scientists today regarding the
extra dimensions of the universe
is that the extra dimensions do
not show themselves in situations
of normal energy. Even normal
energy can be considered as hot
as temperatures in the most pow-
erful of particle accelerators;

This might have been the case

[until someone decided to build

the Large Hadron Collider. Ex-
tra dimensions begin to become
visible when the very fabric of
space and time begins to break
down.

The best example of this phe-
nomenon in modern theoretical
physics ‘is the black hole, and
previous accelerators could not
match the power required to cre-
ate “tame” black holes for study.

The Large Hadron Collider
is helping, steadily, to provide
glimpses into the real world of
high-energy physics by simply
ramping up operating energies.
Experiments already performed
in the Large Hadron Collider
helped Case Western Reserve-

begin to think in a dangerously
philosophical manner.

in nature, they are creating a
model. And like good scientists

program —— skilled at crunching
numbers — to do it.

The computer program they
developed, called BlackMax, is
designed to work closely with
scientists from the ATL_AS ex-
periment at the Large Hadron
Collider to study extremely small
black holes, created in experi-
ments involving collisions be-
tween extremely massive and ex-
tremely short-lived particles.

Colliders up until this point
have been unable to touch this

. level of experimentation, as the

creation of the necessary mas-
sive particles required amounts
of energy that were unavailable
until now.

The black holes created will be
viewed throughout their lifespan,
as the nature of their deaths is
what fascinates scientists.

Stephen Hawking became fa-

mous with his equations of black
hole decay. After aperiod, black
holes simply “evaporate,” as they
slowly release energy back into
the universe.

No one knows the true nature
of black hole death, however, as
a black hole is a difﬁcult subject
to successfully measure.

BlackMax can help interpret
data from the Large Hadron Col-
lider. Case Western Reserve sci-
entists hope that the simulation
and interpretation capabilities of
BlackMax will allow scientists at
the Large Hadron Collider to un-
derstand their data.

Hopes are high that the re-
sults will indicate the existence
of extra, dimensions and allow
scientists to better create a quan-
tum theory of gravity, ultimately
unifying two discordant theories
of physics.

Ultimately the idea of tiny
black holes throughout the uni-

verse is amazing. As long as

' Stephen Hawking ﬁnds a way

to explain how black holes can
evaporate and not slowly steal
information from the universe,
black holes may be all around us
harmlessly taking a little bit here
and a little bit there.

Understanding them will be
the key to fully understanding the
nature of the universe, or at the
very least, we might ﬁnd out if
string theorists really are as crazy
as they sometimes sound.

  Truckers not Stuck in the Past

 

 Drive-By Truckers keeps its cool while chilling out on balconies, but onstage the band rocks
 out to its own modern brand of classic rock that it's bringing to the 21st century.

 Trucker, page8

That doesn’t mean these bands are

 stuck in the past —' both acts are among
 the finest rockers on the road today, keep-
 ing the spirit of real, raw and raucous rock
 ’n’ roll alive.

For the Truckers, that couldn’t .be ‘tru-
er. The band’s rotating cast of die-hard
Southerners has been trekking across the
country from its Alabama home unfail-
ingly for more than a dozen years.

Southern rock doesn’t get much more

~ it was largely folks of African and often

Irish descent who brought their native
music with them.”

Whatever the cause, the culture and
sound of the South shines strong in the
Truckers’ music — and. not just because
of the Skynyrd similarity. The ’band’s
songs take shape more than your average
rock song about love or women. These
tunes tell a story, painting portraits of the

many characters who give the area its ﬂa—’

vor.
“Uncle Phil and Aunt Phillis in the
Month After the Election,” for example,
is an eight—rr1inute, spok_en—word joint
with a whiskey bar bass—line that tells the
story of two unfortunate souls: “Mar-
ried and tried in Vain to have children _/

' Boy did they try / Their attempts were so

feverous and rowdy that they were often

‘evicted / They went at it like wild pigs in

heat.” Who said rock ’n’ roll wasn’t sexy?

Truckers delivers Southern rock to Pittsburgh

Truckers, page 1 0

“I love the old traditionof telling a
story in song and story-telling in general
for that matter,” said Hood. “I’m proud
to do what we can to carry some of -that
forwar .” '

The band truly shines, though, when it
takes the stage.

The Truckers’ live show has been de-
scribed, as anything from deafening to
spectacular, and Hood’s leading of the
songs is often compared to that of a
preacher leading a faithful congregation.

It’s no wonder, then, that while the
band has blissfully ﬂoated just below
the attention of the mainstream, Drive-
By Truckers shows often sell out across
the country and are ﬁlled with fans danc-
ing wildly, enjoying what is undoubtedly
one of the most genuine American rock
bands in the world today. '

Hood loves the stage just as much as
his fans love to see him on it.

“The best part is always the show itself.
I enjoy the camaraderie and the physical

grind of it,” he said.

With the band’s latest album, Brighter
Than Creat:ion’s Dark, getting universally
rave reviews, Drive—By Truckers has more
material than ever. As Hood believes,
there hasn’t been a better time to see the
band kick it onstage than now.

“\We’re-all playing better together than
ever, [and] everyone is being really cre-

_ ative and getting along really well,” said

Hood. “These are truly salad days for
Drive—By Truckers.”

Big East race beginning to

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬂ Writer

Whether it be stooges, muske-
teers or amigos, good things come
in threes.

    
 

The Big East football standings

are no different.

Pitt, West Virginia and Cincin-
nati all stand tied atop the Big East
standings after last weekend with
3-1 conference records.

On Saturday, Big East cellar-

  

dwellers Rutgers and Syracuse
squared off in Piscataway, NJ. The
Orange, coming off a 28-21 upset
over Louisville the week before,
jumped to an early 14-0 lead after
recovering a blocked punt in the

   

endzone.

But it was all Mike Teel and
Rutgers after that.

Teel threw for 276 yards and
three scores in the game to lead
the Scarlet Knights to a 35-17 vic-
tory.

Then, Saturday night, Cincin-
nati and West Virginia dueled in
Morgantown for a chance at Big
East supremacy.

The game was surprisingly one-

‘  sided, with Cincinnati dominating
 through most of the game. But

then came a wild fourth quarter.
West Virginia kicker Pat McAfee
hit a 52-yard ﬁeld goal that brought
the Mountaineers all the way back
from a 13-point deﬁcit and forced
overtime with the score tied at 20.

After McAfee drilled a 27-

 yarder in overtime, Cincinnati
quarterback Tony Pike bootlegged

to his right, lobbing a pass over a
confused Mountaineers defense
and into the hands of Kazeem
Alli for a two-yard score and the
26-23 win.

Here are some weekly awards.

heat up -

Big East Game of the
Weelc

Cincinnati vs. West Virginia
looked like just another ordinary
win for the Bearcats for 45 min-
utes. But a ridiculous comeback by
the Mountaineers started with Pat
White’s three-yard touchdown pass
and two-point conversion with
19 seconds to go. The comeback

continued as the Mountaineers re—'

covered the ensuing on-side kick
and ended with McAfee’s 52-yard
ﬁeld goal as time expired, making
this game an overtime thriller. It
also moved both teams, including
Pitt into the tie for ﬁrst place in
the conference.

Big East Beast of the Week
(Offense):

He’s not exactly the most con-
sistent passing juggernaut, but this
award goes to Rutgers’ Teel. Teel
wins mostly by default, with no
other standout offensive player
this weekend. Still, he impressed,
throwing for 276 yards and three
touchdowns in the Scarlet Knights’
win over Syracuse.

Pitt isn't OK without Fields in lineup

 

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

 

One injury can demolish a
basketball team.

Heading into Friday night’s
season opener against Fairleigh
Dickinson, Pitt is a team strug-
gling with injuries.

Senior guard Levance Fields,
the team leader on the offensive
side of the ball, is down with a
left foot injury, while sophomore
forward Gilbert Brown is also
out with a stress fracture. Neither
is expected to miss much more
time, but neither will likely dress

- for Friday night’s game.

If these injuries — particularly
Fields’ — don’t improve quickly,

Pitt might have some trouble liv-
ing up to its No. 5 ranking. Un-
fortunately for Pitt, Fields’ injury
seems to be a bit worse than the
team anticipated.

Fields has practiced this year,
but it’s been off and on. Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon said that from
now on it’s Fields’ decision as to
when he can or can’t play. But he
needs to get back on the court
constantly to return to playing
shape and help lead Pitt to suc-
cess. The problem is that neither
he nor the coaches want to rush
it.

“It’s obviously his decision,”
said Dixon. “We had hoped he’d

be back by now, [but] it’s not

where we thought it would be.”

Fields originally hurt his foot
last Dec. 29 in a loss against
Dayton — Pitt’s first loss of the
season. He missed seven weeks,
then returned for the end of the
season and the postseason.

This past summer, Fields
played in a Pittsburgh summer
league before having additional

surgery. Since then, he’s been t:ry- \

ing to heal it and prepare for the
season.

Still, Fields hasn’t been doing
a lot of playing. Because Fields
leads the Pitt offense, it misses
him. No player -— no matter
how talented that player might
be -— can just come in and fill his
shoes.

No one can replace the rap-

December, hasn't returned back at full strength.

Pitt, Cincinnati showing

dominance on defense

Big East, page 13

Big East Beast of the Week (De-
fense): J

Tough call here. Even though Pitt’s de-
fense put up points, Cincinnatfs defense
held a West Virginia rushing offense averag-
ing 214.9 yards per game heading into the
weekend, to just 98 yards on the ground.
The Bearcats also held the Mountaineers
to just 4-of-20 on third down, picked off
quarterback Pat White once and recovered
a fumble. 5

Big East Beast of the Week (Special
Teams):
The Bearcats’ Marshawn Gilyard wasted

all of 16 seconds on his 100—yard, open- -

ing-kickoff touchdown return to give the
Bearcats an early lead on their way to an

_ overtime Victory in Morgantown, In the

same game, some credit goesto McAfee for
nailing the 52-yard field goal to force over-
time in the waning seconds of the game.

Big East “It’s Tricky” of the Week:

Honoring the best trick play and‘ razzle-
dazzle of the week, this award goes to Pitt
offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh and
LeSean McCoy. The Wildcat sensation has
long been a featured package of the Pan-
thers this season. But the ‘Panthers added
two new wrinkles to the formation by hav-

ing McCoy hand the ball off to freshman
Aundre Wright for a score and throw a 14-
yard pass to T.]. Porter.

Big East Least of the Week:
Syracuse. Just look at some of these of-

fensive (pun intended) stats. Orange quar-_

terback Cameron Dantley was 3-of-12 pass-
ing and led the team with 19 passing yards.
As a team, the Orange managed seven first
downs and 35 yards passing. The leading
Orange receiver was sophomore running
back Doug Hogue, who caught one pass for
a whopping 12 yards.

Big East Week Ahead:

Cincinnati (7-2, 3-1) at Louisville (5-4,
1-3): The battle for the Keg O’Nails hasn’t
gone Cincinnatfs way since 2002.

Awin here keeps Cincinnati alive for the .

Big East crown. and puts it in sole posses-
sion of first place, with West Virginia an
Pitt off this week. ‘

Rutgers (4-5, 3-2) at South Florida (6-3,
1-3): The demise of South Florida and the
resurgence of Rutgers is what makes this
matchup interesting. -

Connecticut (6-3, 2-2) at Syracuse (2-6,
1-4): This might be the last home game for
Greg Robinson as head coach of the Or-
ange. ' ‘

Young, Blair count on Fields to run the offense

Fields, pagel3

port Fields built with his teammates after
64 starts. No one had the same success
—— 52-12 in those starts ——- that he’s had.
It’s the kind of experience no one can dis-
pute.

“He’s been injured for 11 months,” said
Dixon. “We haven’t really been able to do
anything that we would normally like to do
for [that] period. You can’t sugarcoat it.”

Entering this season after graduating
guards Ronald Ramon and Keith Benja-
min, the second guard slot is wide open.

With Fields _ out, Dixon will have a
chance to take a good look at what he has
at the position. The competition is already
heated, but this might bring it up even
more. «

Freshmen Ashton Gibbs and Travon
Woodall, sophomore Brad Wanamaker
and junior—college transfer Jermaine Dix-
on will each get shots to show what they

_ can do in big—time, real—game situations.

Each will play a lot in the first few weeks.
As they showed in the preseason, each guy
has talent.

The regular season is different, howev-
er. Once Pitt gets into Big East play, expe-
rience will be necessary at the guard spot.

Even when Fields gets back into a nor-
mal practice routine, nothing is immediate.

It’ll take some timeto get back into condi-
tion and ﬁnd the same comfort he had be-
fore — maybe more time than expected.

“We’re just trying to see how it goes,”
said Dixon. “It’s not exactly the best way
to get ready for a season.”

It’s not just the guards who are missing
Fields. It’s everyone else. He creates space
for forward Sam Young, who opted to skip
the NBA Draft for another shot at a title
with Pitt. Fields also feeds Dejuan Blair on
the inside and can create his own shot.

Not only that, but Fields’ motor doesn’t
stop. He’s as physically and mentally tough
as anyone on the court.

He needs to be out there for Pitt to play
up to its expectations with a No. 5 ranking
in the AP poll.

With Fields on the court, he can guide
Pitt’s younger guards just like Carl Krauser
guided himjwhen he was a freshman. He
can help from the bench, but nothing is
like playing beside a guy who has proven
himself time after time.

There’s not much time before Pitt’s
schedule gets tough, and it better hope it
gets Fields back healthy because the Big
East will swallow teams alive this year.
Without Fields, it’ll be tough to escape.
