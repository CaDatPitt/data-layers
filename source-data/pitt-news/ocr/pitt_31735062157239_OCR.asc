 Picture of Castle of Chillon Takes
-First Place in Foto Club Contest

. L Scenic pictures copped first and
..  second prizes at the First Annual

I S - Salon being presented by the Pitt

‘..

Foto Club- in the fine arts gallery
until Saturday of this week.
eThe ﬁrst prize was handed to
James Nadonly for his pictures-
' que scene of a castle-like house
‘overlooking a calm lake.

John Sarraf’s enchanting foto
ofa ﬂower-covered cottage took
second prize. The third—prize win-
ning picture, taken by Gene Shaf-
fer, presented something a little
diﬂ’erent——a distant shot of two Ice
Capade skaters in a butterfly spot-
light.

All Types Represented

The other 50 photographs in-
cluded every type pleasing to the
eye—froin naked babies to snake
charmers to femme fatales.

Among the more unusual fotos
is one of the mushroom smoke
from an tomic bomb, and its re-

. sultant streak across the sky. On
the lighter side the exhibit in-
cludes two charmingﬂansel and
Gretel statues, three little freck-
Iaced boys pondering over a pair
of cap guns, and a naked baby ly-
ing on .a scale.

Scenery is the subject of many
of - the ‘ photos. Snow-capped
mountains, calm lakes, thunder
clouds. and of course the Pitt Ca-

. thedral, surround the seventh

_ floor gallery.

I" ' Assilhouette of the panther in

' Schenley Park completes the spir-
' it or Pitt. The exhibit also includes

a good many portratits--one in
~ particular of an elderly man

 »highlighted by candle-light.

 '_ The exhibit, although i the first
, ofits kind, promises to become an
;.— ' annual event.

Faculty Committee as a result of the turbulent six-month-long foot-
ball probe, will meet for the first time Monday. evening at 8 p. m.
in the Administration Conference Room. -— ‘ '

The revised combine was completed Wednesday with Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgera_ld’s appointment of four faculty members to two-

Nicklas, Jr., both downtown attor-

neys. had previously been named

by Alumni Council, and Bob

Dickey by Student Congress.
Final Step in Probes

Each appointment on the eight-
man board is for two years, ex-
cepting Dickey’s as student dele-
gate for one year. Athletic Di-
rector James Hagan will sit, as the
ninth member ex-ofﬁcio without
vote.

lished the new committee follow-
ing the submission of two con-
ﬂicting reports by Faculty and

The Committee has the author-
ity to hire and fire personnel such
as Coach Mike Milligan and Ath-

acting as chairman. to hear all
cases involving cheating and re-
lated offenses.
Cheating Deﬁned

For the purposes of the new
regulations, cheating has been de-
lined as “giving or attempting to
give, obtaining or attempting to
obtain, information relative to an
examination. test, or other work
that the student is expected to do
alone and not in collaboration
with others.”

If a‘ faculty member feels that
a student is guilty of cheating and
the student denies gL(ilt, the fac-
ulty member mu..t present the case
to the disciplinary committee of
his school for a hearing and final
decision. In other cases it is the
duty of the individual instructor to
enforce the penalties and report
anyaction taken to the dean of the
school. .

Action Goes Into Record

When cheating penalties have
been enforced, the school must
notify the dean of men or the dean
of women and the registrar (as in
all cases of disciplinary action).
If a student should be dismissed
because of a second offense, a re-
port of such action is recorded on
his permanent record ‘in the regis-

_tra.r‘s office.

The new cheating regulations
are the results of deliberations of
a special student-faculty commit-
tee appointed earlier this semes-
ter to investigate the problem as
applied to Pitt and suggest meth-
ods for handling the situation.

Members of the Dean's Commit-
tee are E. A. Holbrook, School of;
Engineering and Mines; V. W.
Lanfear, School of Business Ad-
ministration; S. P. Franklin,
School of Education: H. E. L(mg-
enecker, Graduate School; and S.

Cadets Strut forHigh Army Brass

 

 

._o.5.oog,

Passing in review before inspecting Army oﬂicers and Pitt ROTC heads, the cadet corps of the University of Pittsburgh marched

on the Cathedral lawn Tuesday afternoon. The special session was held for_ the annual federal inspection by Army and Air Force of-
ficers to determine the national rating of the Pitt ROTC for 1948 -49. . v

. 1 . The Last Wérd 1
We don’t know where the custom ‘originated but

somewhere along the ‘line, the Pitt News has picked
up the policy of carrying an editorial in every

/edition. Why we don’t know but unless something

is attacked with the regularity of an internal move-
ment every Tuesday and Friday, the Editorial board
of the paper considers it a lost week.

However these‘sharp edged pen men are
bound to reach an impasse after almost a year
of hacking and tearing. So about this time, they
feel bound to call on outside sources for help.
After” all, Mother’s Day is past and Father’s
Day is still a month away. Student Congress
is out for the summer and the exams ,.Will be
attacked in a week or so.

It’s tooclose to, graduation to blast the Chan-
cellor and grades are almost .in Mr. Quick’s oiﬁce
so they can’t hack at him. What then? A quick
call for helpefor fresh help andthe sports depart-
ment assigns me, a fellow. who is in love with
everybody including the latin department. “Get
someone!” I’m ordered. But who? ‘

Let’s see. There is Harry the elevator dis-
patcher but "the Panther already claims him.
We can get the Building and Grounds crew
but we don’t know enough about them. Who is
there? How about :the librarians? Now we’re
getting warm. There’s altogether too much dust
on the books. Naw, not ‘meaty enough. Say,
I’ve got -it! The Tuck Shop, accuse them of
putting false bottoms on the coke cups. Can’t,

might be able to prove it and then the, Uni- E
versity’s name would be" blackened.

Finally, there is a rumor -about a janitor up
in Thaw Hall who repeatedly drinks left over al-

" cohol in test tubes. Neh! The school iwon’t"1et us

‘ John Golightly

carry liquor advertising. Hah, I’ve got it, the post
ofﬁce on the ﬁrst floor. Good but take it easy on
them, this is an electionyear and we don’t want
it to look like we’re slamming the administration.
Can’t .use Harry’s _name? Conﬁne yourself to the
Building.’ ' ‘ ,

This column wants to go on record_ as be-
ing positively against the post oﬁice department
of the University. The facilities are entirely
lacking for a school of this size. There are no
provisions for chained fountain pens and the
toilet facilities for both men and women are
wanting. °

Besides this, it has come to the attention of the
Pitt News that when a Pitt student buys airmail

stamps, the letter is sent by regular planes. In.

some instances, the pilots haven’t even“been clear-
ed by the Dean of Men’s oﬁice. Maybe even inde-
pendents might be» intrusted with ﬂying frater-
nity mail‘? God Forbid! Hell, I’ve never even sent
a letter. How can Ihack at the Post office. Don’t
be a wise guy, you only need a few more '«lines
to ﬁll up the space.

I can start fresh and take a few cuts at
the Pitt News. You do and we’ll hold back your
key besides not ‘printing this. How about the
people on the paper? Theyre art/ists and'you’ll
get mad and quit. So why don’t you guys write
your own stuff. Shut up and work. I still think
that when Rozanski dipped the, spoon at Tap
Day, it was a damn silly thing to do. Write!

 DiscoJockeys Team Up 1
To Introduce New Tune
Notes

-——- Jerry Newberg o

.Wel1, at last we've reached the end of the sem-
ester and the last Music Notes column for -«the
Spring term. Last week‘ I mentioned the plugging
of a new tune written by two Pittsburghers Harry
Kurtz and Bill Marina. The tune of ‘course “My
First" Look At Heaven.” Here are some highlights
on the tune that are known to very few.

1 Before the tune was ever. recorded by. the Ansa
Recording Company, an arrangement was made by
Arnold Steinmen .who wrote this column under
the title of “Sweet Low Down” back in ’44. Arnie
-arranged the tune for a local band leader named
Skippy Strahl. Skippy recorded the tune at a local
studio just for the heck of it with ‘lovely Nancy
Reed handling the vocals. Nancy is a Pittsburgh
girl .who now sings with Skitch Henderson and
was formerly with Hal Mclntyre.

Another true story about this new romantic bal-
lad found its beginning while Harry Kurtz was in
the Army. Harry was ‘ fortunate enough to meet
Gordon MacRae who now records on the Capitol
label. MacRae liked the tune and made a record-
ing for Harry on an 8” disc which Harry now treas-
ures in his record collection. So you see kids, its a
rough deal‘ getting a song on its way to the _top,
‘but it can be done.
Wax Wise 2
Sarah Vaughn’s next Musicraft release wil
couple two movie tunes, “It’s Magic” and “It’s You
or No One” .’ . . Johnny Ilong has a’ new signa-
ture platter, pairing a_ reissue of “Just Like That”
with “If I Can’t Have The One I Love” . . .
T_ony Pastor is on the market with ‘a new hit. In
“A Boy From Texas,” Tony joins the Clooney
Sisters. This relaxed cjuiet number is about a boy
from the wide open spaces who ﬁnds love in”the
big city. The Pastor rhythm section keeps up a
leisurely pace with the hoof-beat effect. On the
ﬂipover is “Rambling Rose,” where Tony compares
his girl to the rose that .can easily" be trained to
grow on a trellis around your door. All I can say
is “teach me how.” The tune has a nice bounce,
ﬁne for a slow jitter "or a swingy fox-trot . . .

Time for Classes Between Spins

Getting up’ at 4:45 a.m. would
constitute a major crisis to most
people, but to Dan Mallinger it’s
all in a day’s work.

Dan’s the man you hear on
WPIT early in the morning an-
nouncing the time, reading com-
mercials, playing records, reading
the comics —— in fact, doing his ut-
most in general to rout you out of
bed before you miss your bus.

In addition to his 40--hour week
as disc jockey at WPIT, Dan man-
ages to carry 13 credits here at
Pitt. Classes are wedged in ﬁrmly
between newscasts, commercials,
and record spinnings. The result

is a schedule between the radio
station and Pitt that reads some-
thing like a railroad schedule.

At 6 a.m., the oiﬁcially signs

two-hour program called “Sun-
rise Serenade.” Bleary-eyed ear-
1y-risers who resent the synthetic
cheer of some early morning disc
jockeys will ﬁnd welcome relief
in Mallinger.

For one thing, he’s refreshing-

THIS IS‘ no “yo1<e’.’, son. If people have been calling you egg-
head because your hair looks soft-boiled, here's eggs-actly
what to do. Get busy with popular Wildroot Cream-Oil hair
tonic. It grooms your hair neatly and naturally without that
gooey look. Relieves annoying dryness and removes loose, ugly A
dandruff. Helps you pass the Fingernail Test! Wildroot Cream-
Oil is non—a1coholic . . . contains soothing Lanolin. Get a tube
or bottle of Wildroot Cream-Oil at any driig or toilet goods
counter today. Always ask your barber for a professional
application. (Better be hard-boiled with your roommate——
keep egging him to get some Wildroot Cream-Oil of his own.
It’s tops for keeping your sunny side up!) A

1y natural. You often get the im-
pression that he’s just as tired as
you are. He yawns frequently,
wonders out loud what to do next,
mimics the records, reads Dick
Tracy, and doesn’t even pretend
to like rainy mornings.

It it’s drizzling outdoors, he
doesn’t sing blithely about um-
brellas or ducks. He says simply,
“The weather? It’s crummy!”

Dan got his start in radio with
the army. He spent two and one
half years in khaki, and while in
the ETO got plenty of broadcast-
ing experience. Among other
things, he broadcasted the Wim-
bleton tennis matches, the Army-
Navy “Spaghetti Bowl” game from
Italy, and the GI Championship
Track and Field Meet. As that
might suggest, he’s aiming for a
job as sports announcer.

Right now, Dan’s a junior——but
completely in the dark as to when

he will graduate. Before.he went
into the army, Dan was a cheer

leader here, and an old hobby of
his, photography, earned him the
job of photo editor for the Owl
back in 1943.

Hobbies have to~take a back
seat now, though. His days are
just too full. His schedule builds
up to a final crescendo every af-
ternoon about 4 p.m., when he
conducts‘ a program called “Spon-
sor” direct from~ the Smithﬁeld
Record and Gift Center. On Sat-
urdays he has a two and a half

‘hour program entitled “Saturday

Musical Matinee,” a show involv-
ing a turntable, more records, and
voluminous requests.

“Dangerous Dan” is a man of
many talents —‘— he ﬁles records
and transcriptions, prepares news-
casts, answers the phone in' the
early hours at the studio, and

subtly comments on anything and-

everything. But there’s one ques-
tion he can’t answer: When does
he ﬁnd time to sleep? Frankly,
he doesn’t know.

Baseball Team Hopes to Play
Postponed Game at Aspinwoll

Pit.t’s baseball team may yet achieve a .500 season.
Prospects of such a ﬁnish hinge on the ei‘I"orts of the Ath-
letic Administration’s eﬁorts to reschedule last Monday’s wash-
ed-out game with Salem.
Originally scheduled for the
Aspinwall Veterans Hospital, the
game will be played sometime
next week if the Hospital ﬁeld is
available on a day that is conveni-
ent for both teams.
Permanent cancellation of the
game would leave the Panthers

'(3—6) without enough games to
break even. In addition to the in-

deﬁnite Salem contest, Ralph Mit-
terling’s crew has a double-header
with West Virginia May 29.

Assuming that both the Salem
and West Virginia games are play-
ed, there remain minor details
ominous enough to command con-
sideration.

They are that Salem was unde-
feated in its first nine games and
West Virginia had run up a win
streak of 11 games before being
beaten by Waynesburg and Mary-
land recently. '

Perhaps Pitt had better hope for
more thundershowers. L
