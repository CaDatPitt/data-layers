Graduatestudents Discuss Health Insurance, Housing

By COLLEEN McDONAL'D
' pm News Staff Writer’
At a luncheon buffet meeting of

the Graduate Professional Student -
' Association (GPSA) Saturday,

plans were discussed .for a
university-wide health insurance
policy, graduate student housing
and a graduate school dental clinic.
Attending the meeting ‘were 30
representatives from the various
~Graduate School Organizations
(GSO), which make up the GPSA.

GPSA member) Joni Klepin,
reviewed the policy changes in the
Teaching Assistant/Teaching
Fellows/Graduate Student
Assistants (TA/TF/GA) program
here at the university. .

Said Klepin, “We are recommen-
ding that a standing committee be
made to oversee the revised policy.
The deans will have more power to
adequately enforce training of the
assistants,” she added.

Sigma Chi, Newsman
Walk For Heart Fund

By COLLEEN McDONALD -
Pitt News Staff Writer

Sigma Chi fraternity sponsored a
Greek Week
Walkathon to raise money for the
Western ‘Pennsylvania Heart
Association last Friday. Channel
Four newsman and President of the
Heart Association Paul Long join-
ed the brothers andlittle sisters in
their seven—tenths of a mile jaunt.

The fraternity gathered in front
of the Cathedral of Learning to pre-
sent Long with a personalized
Sigma‘Chi sweatshirt and plaque,
then the group proceeded up

Bigelow Boulevard despite the im-

pending rain.
Several hundred dollars are to be
raised by the walk, said Long.
"“The money will be spent in
research here atthe University. It is
‘earmarked for Pitt’s medical
school,” said Long.

The brothers hope to get from
$700’ to $1000, said Harry O’Neill,

originator of the “seven-tenths”
idea. On his way back to the frater-
nity’s house, the destination point
for the walk, O’Neill remarked,
“We found people don’t care how
far you walk; they’re just willing to
donate to a worthy cause.”
Chapter advisor of Sigma Chi,
Bill Chrisner, had 70 sponsors.
Chrisner, an alumni member, acts
as a liason between fraternity alum-

' ni, the local Beta Theta chapter and-

the general headquarters. His total
alone came to $263.

“This was our main charity col-
lection drive for Greek Week,” said
Sigma Chi’s president, Greg
“Howdy” Davis. “We’re also out

v.

collecting with cans.” ' ‘

One member, junior Joe Blazer,
promised his sponsors that he
would walk the “mile”'backwards.
Bringing up the rear of the’55

member caravan Blazer quipped, f‘I_

have to watch for the cracks, the
curbs and potholes.”

surance plan was also recommend-
ed. Larry Sutton, Chairperson of
the GPSA Health Insurance Com-
mittee, explained that the commit-
tee was “in the process of compiling
a comparative study of current
university insurance requirements
and policies available.”

Screening dates for graduate
students to receive orthodontic
work were announced. David Mof-

» fa, from the Dental Medicine GSO,

reported that plans for a special

graduate school dental clinic were
under way.

“We would encourage all
graduate students to seek dental
treatment at reduced rates at the
dental school,” said Moffa. “This
will also include graduate students’
spouses and children,” said Moffa.

The screening dates, by appoint-

'ment, are April 11, 14, 23, and 29 r

from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Addi-

tional flyers concerning this infor-

mation will be distributed among all
graduate and professional students.

Lamont Hughes, chairperson of
GPSA, proposed recommendations
for graduate student housing.

The- GPSA Housing Committee
will begin to assess the advantages
and disadvantages of the proposed
sites, which are in the Bellefield
area, North Oakland,'and the upper
hillside above the stadium, north of
Trees field, said Hughes.

‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Office of News and
Publications, one of six depart-
ments under the Public Affairs divi-
provides communications
assistance to the university through
three ,different services—news,
publications and the University
Times. .

“We are essentially a service
department,’.’ said Mary Ann Aug,
director of News and Publications.
“Ourchief service is to ‘promote
communication to outside audi-
ences—potential students, faculty,
staff and the community.”

The news department promotes

. current university issues, campus

academic and entertainment ac-
tivities, student and faculty achieve-
ments, and, generally, positive im-
ages of university life,'according to‘
Aug.

“I’m convinced that any eventor
any activity is. of interest to at least

one source,” said Daryl Clemmens, ,

associate director for news. “We
find the angle and market it.”

The efforts of the office’s news
services revolve around several
strategies. -

Often a client will come to the of-
fice with a promotional request.
Clemmens claims that students are
“fairly astute in judging what is
newsworthy,” ‘but a determination
of what type of coverage that is best’
suited for the request must be
made. 0

“It’s almost an educational pro-
cess,” said Clemmens. “We talk
about it—why it is important, how
we can get the best play for it.”

The department’s promotional

efforts for last Mar_ch”s salad eating -

contest during Greek Week includ-
ed the slogan, “The Crunch That
Ate Pittsburgh.” .The efforts
resulted in television coverage.

For events which are ‘clearly
visual, newspaper-photo coverage
may be used as well as video spots.
Other events are publicized through

press releases only. It is up to the
department to know the event, and V
media so no time is - wasted in .
coverage planning.

Often the media come to the‘

department with placement requests

for radio shows and ‘television
segments. Faculty “academic
points of view” and student opi-
nion are solicited.

“The media sometimes want a
local comment on a national issue,”
said Clemmens. She added that the

' department filled 35-40 placement

requests concerning the Iranian

«crises for different angles on a

“generic issue.”

» Clemmens also said the media
often calls to confirm the legitimacy
of a campus event. ‘

"The media is becoming wary of ,

being used by various groups. They

are becoming aware of staging just

for coverage,” Clemmens said.
When the department notices an

event on its own, it will make the

Equibank N.A., which has
‘over 85 neighborhood offices,
recently applied to the Penn-
sylvania Department of Banking
for a state charter. The change
from national to state charter
will not affect customers, accor-
I cling to bank officials.

“About the only noticeable
change will be in our name,”
said Lisa Jepson-Lozano,
manager of communications for

the Pittsburgh based bank.
“The letters N.A. at the end of
our name, which standfor Na-
tional Association, will be drop-
ped.”

Bank management has been
studying the change for some
time. The change was decided
upon so the bank “can make
more efficient use of our
resources,” according to
Jepson-Lozano.

She explained that all banks
are required to maintain a cer-

tain percentage of their assets in
reserve. Nationally chartered
banks who are members of the
Federal Reserve (the Fed) are
not permitted to earn interest on
these reserves. Banks chartered
in Pennsylvania, who are not
members of the Fed, are allowed
to keep some of these reserves in
interest-bearing government
securities. I

Bank officials assure student
customers that their money will -

uibank Applies For Astute Banking Charter

still be insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC). They point out that
membership in the FCID has
nothing to do with who a bank is
chartered by.

Recently a survey of all U.S.
banks indicated that most are
state chartered. Of the nearly
15,000 banks, over 10,000 are
chartered by their respective
states. Of these, more than
9,000 are not members of the

Fed, while 1,000 are. The sur-
vey also noted that over 300
banks nationwide have left the
Fed in the last five years.

The two different banking
systems were set up in 1863 by
the National Banking Act.
According to an Equibank pam-
phlet explaining the change,
“Equibank is only exercising a
long—standing American option
to choose between a state or na-
tional charter.”

By The Associated Press
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh on Sunday night gave
the militants holding American
hostages 24 hours to make a ﬁnal
decision on whether a U.N. com-

. mission will meet with the captives

and if they are to be transferred to
government custody.

Ghotbzadeh” speaking after a
Revolutionary Council meeting
Sunday night, did not say what ac-
tion would be taken if the deadline
were not met, and he set no precise
time for a response by the militants.

He chastised the militants for
new conditions they imposed Sun-

    |ran’s Ghotbzadeh Criticiz

day on transferring the approx-
imately 50 hostages heldin the U.S.
Embassy and said a decision by the
ruling Revolutionary Council on ar-
rangements to deal with the
hostages would be announce before
noon Monday.

Spokesmen for the militants told
reporters at the U.S. Embassy com-
pound in Tehran that they were
“ready at.any minute” to carry out
their decision to transfer the
hostages if the conditions were met.

They demanded the transfer be .

publicized in advance through
broadcasts on the state-run radio
network, “to' keep the Iranian peo-

ple informed of all the details,” and
that Ghotbzadeh be replaced as
the Revolutionary Council's official
representative in arranging the
transfer.

They added that they were deter-
mined to remain inside the embassy
grounds after the transfer to reveal
more documents from the embassy
files. Previously they have released
documents they allege prove the
embassy was a “den of spies.”

“We are not eager to hand over
the hostages, but since we want to
prevent any ‘deviation and conﬂict
with the authorities of the country
in spite of our will we are prepared

to hand‘ them over,” said one of

' three unidentified spokesmen.

They said the conditions were
presented to three senior "Foreign
Ministry officials earlier Sunday in
talks at the embassy.

Following that meeting, Ghotb-
zadeh issued a statement criticizing
the militants for imposing the con-
ditions, saying their behavior had
been exposed to the nation.

,“It is certain the students do_not
intend to hand over the hostages or
to let the United Nations commis-
sion visit them,” Ghotbzadeh said
in a statement reported by the of-
ﬁcial Pars news agency. It did. not

es Embassy Militants’,

indicate if he meant the captois’
merely were dragging their feet or
never would transfer control of the
approximately 50 hostages.

“From the Foreign Ministry
point of view, the behavior of the
students shows to the great Iranian
nation the essence of how the pro-
blem is,” he said.

Ghotbzadeh also said the
militants had demanded eight
hours’ notice of the transfer of
custody and want him to
acknowledge that the moment the
Americansare in the custody of

authorities “the receiver is responsi-

ble for their lives,” Pars said.

Computer To Alert President Of World Crises Is Deficient

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The world’-
wide computer system built to warn
the president of an enemy attack or
international crisis is prone to break
down under pressure, according to
informed sources who have worked
on or examined the system.

The system already has failed in
at least two critical situations, the
sources said.

A team of government auditors
concluded that the computers, con-
sidered a bargain when they were

installed nearly a decade ago, are
fundamentally deficient in design
and cannot be used effectively for
military command purposes.

The auditors say the Pentagon
has spent $1 billion trying to make
its World Wide Military Command
and Control System work, yet the
system—called Wimex—remains
unacceptably slow and unreliable.

The manufacturer agrees the
system doesn't work very well but
says it could be modiﬁed to im-'

' prove its performance.

Defense Department officials
privately acknowledge they have
had repeated problems with the
computer network, but they insist
they can get by without it when they
have to.

James F. May, one of several ex-
perts from industry brought in to
survey Pentagon computer opera-
tions, told The Associated Press the
Wimex system is “at best very
fragile.” , . ‘ .

And John H. Bradley, an elec-
tronic engineer who helped test the

computer network during its
development, says he was fired

‘ after he went over his bosses’ heads

to warn the White House that the
president shouIdn’t depend ~ on
Wimex to tell him of a Soviet at-
tack. -

The Defense Department says the
president doesn't depend solely on
Wimex because there are two other, _
faster systems designed to detect a
nuclear strike. However, a task,
force reporting to the President's

Office of Management and Budget
found that at least one of those
"‘S‘uffers frequent power interrup-
tions due to electrical storm activity
in Colorado.”

The Wimex system was designed
to warn the president and military
chiefs of an enemy attack or securi-
ty crisis such as the seizure of an
embassy. The system also should
provide up-to-date information
about U.S. forces and options in
any given area or situation.

WASHINGTON—Vice Presi-
deht Walter F. Mondale is in charge
of the Carter "administration’s ef-
fort to minimize the political
damage from the U.S. vote in the
U.N. Security Council against
Israeli settlements.

President Carter’s political forces
are braced for a wave of criticism
over the way the administration
handled the settlements issue. But,
says one high-ranking member of
the vice president's staff, it has not
hit yet.

That may change when Mondale
visits New York Wednesday for a
meeting with representatives of
Jewish groups.

Carter is known to understand
that his administration’s errors in
voting for the controversial U.N.
resolution will have adverse
political consequences.

The controversy began last week
when Carter acknowledged that
faulty communications led the
United States to vote March 1 in
favor of a Security Council resolu-
tion condemning Israel’s policy of
establishing Jewish settlements in
occupied Arab territories, including
east Jerusalem. Administration of-
ficials said the United States should
have abstained as long as the resolu-
tion mentioned Jerusalem, which
Israel annexed after" the 1967 Mid-
dle East war. I

After spending’ nearly a week in
the next crucial bat-
tleground in the race between
Carter and Sen. Edward M. Ken-
nedy for the Democratic presiden-
tial nomination,
James Johnson said he had yet to
see “a serious political problem
resulting from the U.N. vote.”

Nonetheless, said Johnson, who
is Mondale’s executive assistant,
“there is naturally concern about
it.” . '

Mondale told Carter last Monday
morning that Donald F. McHenry,
U.S. ambassador to the United Na-
tions, had voted‘ for a resolution
that did not conform to the wording
Carter thought it contained when

Mondale aide .

his instructions were given to
McHenry. \

That was after Ephraim Evron,
the Israeli ambassador in
Washington, visited Mondale that
morning to discuss the matter.

But, Johnson said, Mondale had
not heard any complaints at that

point from the Jewish groups with

whom he has maintained close ties
since he became vice president.

A clearer gauge of the impact of
the foul-up may come Wednesday
morning at Mondale’s meeting in
New York with Jewish leaders and
in assessments of voting this Tues-
day in Jewish neighborhoods in
Florida and Georgia, which are
holding primary elections.

the vote that was disavowed.

proper contacts to get media
-coverage. The use of hometown
releases is an example of such in-
dependent efforts. The department
sends information about students’
achievements to their hometowns to
be publicized in the local papers.
Although the department does
not promote“ sports events, Aug
states that “9O percent of the time
we are initiating strong publicity
about what the students, faculty
and staff do.”
The department of publications
prints 500 different publications in
the health profession, provost,

' public ‘affairs and student affairs

areas.

According to Richard Rieker,
associate director for publications,
only informational and promo-
tional publications are" printed.
These include catalogs, brochures
and flyers for recruitment and
event publicity purposes. ,

Although student organizations
are exempt from the department’s
services, the department receives re-
quests from various university
departments and schools for self-
promotion.

Rieker and his staff review the re-
quests every fiscal year and recom-
mend, if necessary, departmental
re-evaluations. The staff will also
provide copy and design if re-
quested.

Rieker is also editor of PITT,‘ an
alumni magazine, published
quarterly through this department.

    News iAndiPubIic0tions
Promotes University   

The University Times, a bi-
weekly newspaper, is also published
through the Office of News and

‘ Publications.

According to Editor Nancy
Brown, the paper reports university
news from an employee angle. It
covers news exclusive to the faculty
and staff and reports how student
issues will affect them. ’

Brown stresses that the Univer-
sity Times is not a competitor of
The Pitt News.

“If we are going to duplicate ttfe’
efforts of others, there’s no reason
for us to be here,” Brown claims.

The University Times was first
printed during the sixties, basically
as a house organ.

“As I understand, there was no
major means of communication for
staff and faculty,” Brown said.

Since her undertaking of the
paper as editor in September,
Brown has initiated some technical
changes and has hired a new staff of
three full-time reporters‘.

In addition, Brown plans to
review the paper stylistically during

August when its printing is tem-

porarily halted until September.

“I really view it as annewspaper,”
Brown said. “There are profes-
sional people here.”

Students interested in publicizing
events should plan to contact the
Office of News and Publications
ideally within three weeks of the
event.

Throughout the year, these students participate in

Legal   Awareness Committee Victim of ‘Inaccurate Reporting’ D

As an active and concerned
member of Student Government

‘Board’s Legal Awareness Commit-
‘tee, I’d like to state a couple of

things that have contributed to the
“scandal” that The Pitt News has
commercialized in several recent
publications. It is obvious to LAC

_ and others involved in the situation

I ' that much of what is being reported

' hasn’t been thoroughly researched.

‘ Pitt News staff writers, have been ir-

responsible. _ in. their reporting,

son of LAC was asked to resign.
(Note Pitt News’ headline of March
7: “Legal Awareness Chairman
Pressured to Resign Job.”) Why
not be truthful and objective,
stating “Legal Awareness Chairper-
son Re-elected?”

Secondly, former LAC treasurer
Mike Langer’s allegations against

. ‘Curiale are unfounded and unclear.

tunately, Curiale herself ‘was con-

. centrated on and portrayed as caus-

ing many of the problems LAC.
has been having. ‘ Actually, our
organizational difficulties were

a mainly a result of certain committee

members’ inability to maintain a
proper perspective between per-
sonal and business relations. This
inability is partially demonstrated
by Langer’s and former secretary
Linda Seguino’s pursuance of the
issue via The Pitt News.

My point is not to harangue
about LAC’s situation as others
have. Rather, I have two requests:

' one, that The Pitt News be more ac-

ciirately informative in their repor-
ting, and two, that they don’t over-
exploit situations as petty as the one
LAC has been experiencing.

The LAC is an effective and
cohesive group, and I wish the
newly-elected officers my con-
gratulations and best wishes in con-
tinuing with the organization's past
and future efforts.

In the meantime, does The Pitt
News owe the SGB an apology? I
think so. ' .

Key to Liberty

The Mayﬂower Compact was a
unique instrument of government.’

Onthe historic ship a written agree-
ment was drawn up on or about
Nov. 9,
democratic form of government.
Before they landed our Pilgrim
Fathers signed the compact:

“In the name of God, Amen.
We whose names are underwritten,
the loyal subjects of our dread
soveraigne, Lord King James by ye
Grace of God, of Great Britaine,
Franceand Ireland_ King, Defender
of ye faith, etc. Having undertaken

for ye glorie of‘ God, and ad-"

vancements of ye‘ Christian Faith

and honor ofourking and countrie,‘
a voyage to plant, ye first colonie in _- '
ye northern.p‘arts__of Virginia, do. by

these presents solemnly and mutual-
ly in ye presence of God, and one of
another, covenant and combine
ourselves together into a civil body
politic; for our better ordering and
preservation and furtherance of ye
ends afore-said; and by virtue
hereof to enacte, constitute and
frame such equal lawes, ordinances,
acts, constitutions. . . ’ ’

John Carver was the first to sign.
Brewster, Bradford, Standish and
Winslow were leaders in writing this
extraordinary document.

In these carefully written and

* meaningful words we look upon the

cradle of American freedom. Here
we see the key ideas of religious and
political liberty. I
The leaders of the Mayﬂower
were religious dissenters. 'They
seceded from the Church of

1620, providing for a ‘

England— the state church
—because the people could not
worship as theypleased. Because
people like John Robinson,,pastor.

of the Pilgrims and “Defender of
Conscience,” wanted to purify the" - ' ‘ '
church from. within, they were _- I '
persecuted and imprisoned. They V
were called Puritans in derision.  i- -»

much of this nation’_s*great_ne"ss and; 
prosperity back to the‘ Mayﬂower-,.  . -‘
Compact and to the people who ‘ “I 
wrote it.  ' -

 

The signers of the Mayﬂower‘ ‘
Compact belonged to the class of I ~
people who enjoyed learning and
culture. One authority characteriz-
ed Puritanism this way: “The more
enlightened Puritanism contained
within it a portion of the spirit of
the Renaissance.” This is not the
pictured caricature of the Puritan
presented to the world that in
England and America the Puritans
sowed the good seed of the two- .
party system—a political
phenomenon.

Pitt’s men’s swimming team pull-

  Grgurich Resigns; New Coach Needed Soon
0 n th e R u n

By MARIA SCIULLO

 

The resignation of Pitt head basketball coach Tim
Grgurich Friday came as a surprise to most people.
While the 37-year-old Grgurich had recently in-

- dicated he was not totally happy with some aspects of '
his job at Pitt, Panther basketball has been his life
since his playing days in the 60s.

When Buzz Ridl announced his resignation as Pan-
ther coach after the 1974-75 season, Grgurich—then
an assistant coach and chief recruiter—was ap-
pointed to the position that same day. In five years as
head coach, Grgurich compiled a won-loss record of
69-70. The record is deceptive, however, as the 6-21
season of four years ago was followed by three winn-
ning seasons. _

Every coach must take into account the possibility-
of losing a player or two to injury or other problems,
although Grgurich had more than his share. In 1975,
leading Pitt rebounder Mel Bennett announced he

 7' had signed a pro contract with the Virginia Squires

and would not return for his sophomore year. Short-
ly thereafter, backup center Kelvin Smith was ruled
academically ineligible. Then, senior leaders Tom

_ Richards and Keith Starr suffered a broken wrist and

torn knee cartiledge, respectively. The loss of Mike
Rice to academic problems two years later was
another major catastrophe.

To a lesser degree, every team since then has been
afflicted by similar bad luck.

Grgurich told reporters Friday that it was “in my
best interests to look for other horizons.” The
former Pitt coach has supposedly looked into assis-
tant coaching jobs at North Carolina State and'South
Carolina, while the head job at Ohio University is

When Grgurich stated that he “couldn’t ask for
more” from his players this season, he was right. It’s
no secret that Pitt was not as talented in all positions
as some of the other teams in the Eastern Eight this
year. Reaching the tournament semi—finals and
beating teams such as Iona, St. Bonaventure and

. Villanova meant playing to the max.

It is also no secret that it is imperative to im-
mediately hire someone to replace Grgurich. A selec-
tion committee including John Conimikes, general

manager of WTAE-TV; Edward Ifft, insurance ex-
ecutive and former president of the Pitt Golden Pan-
thers booster club; Dr. Michael Zernich, one of three
brothers to play basketball for Pitt in the late
40s—early 50s; Dean Billick, Pitt sports information
director, plus two others has been formed.

Years ago, Pitt made the costly mistake of believ-
ing it could shop around for a football coach. After
Dave Hart’s demise in 1968, Pitt deliberated for
almost two months before hiring (in his own words)
“the coach nobody wanted”—Carl DePasqua.
DePasqua led the Panthers to new lows during his
reign and Pitt football had to rely upon a major
change to win back its former prestige. ,

Clearly, for the sake of recruiting in particular and

the pro ram in eneral Pitt must set its sights on one

or two candidates and go after them. A Washington,
DC, source has said that Villanova head coach Rollie
Massimino is available and interested. Massimino

likes the Eastern Eight and was not thrilled with his-

school’s indications that it will withdraw from the
league. Villanova, for the sake of its national calibre
track program, has remained a member of the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC). The
committments to the Eastern Eight and the ECAC
after conflict.

Presently, recruiting efforts are seriously impaired-
by Grgurich’s resignation. High school players want
to know for whom they’ll be playing. Uncertainty in
Pitt’s program would severly jeopardize the program

For the second week in a row the
Pitt indoor soccer squad placed in
tournament competition, when the

’ team participated in the highly

respected Grove City Tournament
ﬁlled with top-quality teams in the
east. The Panthers took a fourth
place in the 12-team tourney after

final round of the playoffs.

Lock Haven 5-2 as winger Trevor

overtime to Slippery Rock. The
Panthers were on the scoreboard
with only 10 seconds in play when
Hughes took a ball on the left wing,
dribbled a few yards and placed one
perfectly into the nets. The re-
mainder of the scoring was
acredited to defensemen Danny

.Hamm as he put in a hat trick per-

formance against the Rock. Hamm,
with two of these goals put the Pan-
thers up by a 3-0 score and apparent
securing of third place. But that was

_ not to be. Slippery Rock tied the

score at three midway through the
second half with three quick goals.

test with the Panthers losing by a

Pitt News Sports Editor

The Panther gymnastics team
rounded out a winning season
Saturday, defeating Farmingdale
229.4-210.95. Pitt upped its record
to 6-2 for the season.

‘ ‘It was a close meet after the first
event as we were only ahead by one
point after the floor exercise,” said

,,Pitt coach Frank D’Amico. “The

second event, the side horse, was

actually the turning point of the-

meet. ”

Last year, Farmingdale ne_arly
pulled off an upset of the Panthers
because of the sidehorse when they
won that event by seven points.

“I decided to switch the lineup
for the horse,” D’Amico said. “It
was an attempt to get our first guy.
to hit and hope the next few guys
for Farmingdale would have
breaks. The judges had to make a
quick decision on who was better.”

Apparently, D’Amico’s strategy
worked, as the Panthers won the
horse by five points. Rich Gazda
tied Farmingda1e’s best sidehorse
performer for first place with an
8.4. According to D’Amico, Satur-
day was one of the sidehorse team’s
best days of the season.

In the next event, the rings, the
Panthers again came out on top;
this time by three points.

“The ring team did a great job,”
said D’Amico. “When you have
only five guys competing, all their
scores count, so you can’t afford
any misses. After the rings, we

3
/4:

" said.

were ahead by nine points and then
we just left them in the dust.”

One of the meet’s highlights was
Bob Besong’s vault. He scored a
9.4 and won the event. Besong is

the Panther’s lone hope to qualify’

at nationals, according to
D’Amico.

The Panthers won the parallel
bars but the coach said they really
didn’t hit. Besong and Chris Fe-

miani tied for first place, each scor- ’

ing an 8.1.

In the ﬁnal event, the high bar,
the Panthers had probably their
worst day of the season, the coach

“We were fortunate enough that
we were winning by a big margin at

the time, because we lost the
event,” said D’Amico.

Besong again tied for first place,
scoring an 8.15. He also won the
all-around with a total score of
49.8.

Reflecting back on- the season,

D’Amico said, “We had a pretty

good year but we didn’t score as
high as I had hoped. We had too
many injuries and our lack of depth
hurt us the most.”

He added that with only five guys
competing, the range between the
best and worst individual’s scores
can be as much as two-and-a-half
points. I

“In other words,” he said, “if
our best score is a 9.0 and the worst
is a 6.5, it makes it tough to win a
meet or score the kind of totals I
know we are capable of scoring.”

Bob Besong won the all-arouhd with 49.8 pointsiin Pitt’s sea

Pitt News Staff Writer  “I
This weekend’s_.gCoaches Con-
ference Track Meet at the.Field

House proved to be just’ as exciting _

as had been predictedgas "Pitt’s.
men’s track team dashed, to a third
place finish out of a field consisting
of the East’s top teams. ' ’

Pitt’s relay teams continued to
look impressive as they beat out
Penn State for first place in both
the mile and two-mile relay events.

The mile relay team .consisting of
Larry Shippen, Bud Cooper,
Dwayne DeFoor, and. Darryl

 Baynes Tnlpped East Carolina -._and
5 "Penn State’ at the finish line while

being clocked at 3.19‘. Only one se-
cond separated Pitt anchorman '

Baynes from the second andthird

place» finishers in athrilling "race
that truly went right down to. the
wire. . F ' ’

The two-mile relay team "of Joel
Albers, Darren Geary, Terry
Gallagher, and Greg Conover won

‘their event'in a time of 7.35. Thev

are currently ranked sixth national-
ly and travel to Detroit, Michigan -
for nationals next weekend.

Penn State placed first in the

‘meet followed by Rutgers, Pitt,

; East Carolina, Cleveland State,

WVU, Massachusetts, and
Virginia. With the Panthers’ two
victories in the relays, it marks the
sixth consecutive time they have
beaten Penn State in relays this
year.

Ralph Mitton of Pitt performed
well also, finishing second in the
long jump, and third in the triple
jump. .

Distance runner Gary Siriano
finished third in the mile run with a
time of 4.11_, while Shippen placed

second in the quarter-mile with a
time of 49.5. ,

Pitt placed twice in the 600—yard
run, with Cooper taking fourth and
Baynes sixth place.

“Where we have people, we have
good people,” said Panther head
coach Mike Agostinella. “We just
don’t have as much depth as we’d
like to. Nonetheless, it was a fine

A ending to the indoor season.”

The best overall performance was
turned in by Paul Lankford of Penn
State, recipient of the MVP award.
Lankford had a busy day placing in

‘-13 ,

two events and winning two others.

  

He was victorious in the ‘quarter- . 
mile and 50-yard hurdles, and  7
placed high in the 50-yard dash and ‘ ’
while running with the mile relay . 5

team .

Another impressive event was the

high jump wherecompetition was "

4)?

extremely tight with four ‘entrants 7 
leaping 6’10 or better. There was a ' "

nice turnout at the Field House and it

for those who made the strenuous
trek up Cardiac Hill,‘ they viewed
quite a display of talent from start
to finish. A ’ 1

ties continued to be frequent.

The last deadlock came with 1:38
left when Acguirre hit a pair of free
throws to make it 67-67. UCLA
then took over again and rode out

the remaining play on its free throw 1

accuracy with the final score the

‘biggest margin the Bruins had been

able to amass throughout the game.

Clutch free-throw shooting by
guards Dave Britton and Tyrone
Ladson carried Texas A&M to a
78-61 double overtime victory over
North Carolina yesterday in the se-

Pitt SjtudentjOpera Debut

Highlights Young Singers

Anyone who thinks opera is a
combination of foreign words that
get lost in the music and $50 a seat,
should be prepared to become
enlightened when the Pitt Student _
Opera makes their debut March 13, '
at 8:30 p.m., in the University of
Pittsburgh’s Studio Theatre. “A
Hand of Bridge by Samuel Barber,
and The Secret of Susanna by Wolf-
Ferrari, will be performed.

A Hand of Bridge is a comic
glimpse at the hidden dreams and
frustrations of a pair of suburban
married couples, “and it is a rare
instance of modern American opera
that is short, dramatically powerful,
and since it was composed in 1959,
is musically up to date,” said Jef-
frey Klotz, stage director for the
Pitt Student Opera.

- Written by Samuel Barber in col-
laboration with Gian Carlo Menotti,
- A Hand of Bridge is popular‘ across
the country in student opera
workshops because of its brevity (10
minutes) and completeness.

The Secret of Susanna, is a com-
edy of deception and supposed
marital infidelity between an Italian
count and his pretty, young wife. _-
“It was choosen because it is a con-
trasting pieceto A Hand of
Bridge, said Klotz. 5

“From the Italian Verismo‘ school
of opera,'like Puccini, it offers
grand operatic singing within the
context of a simple setting, using" a
cast of only two singers and a silent
actor.”

“We choose to do it in English
because the humor of the piece'is an
integral part of the production,”
added Klotz. .

But the uniqueness of the produc-
tion lies in the fact that all the cast
members with the exception of one,
are fall term students in the music
department or are enrolled in a
special course created for this per-
formance.

The idea of the Pitt Student
Opera came from Miss Claudia Pin-
za, who_ is musical director for the
program. A new faculty member,
Miss Pinza came from Duquesne
University with the encouragement
of Mildred Miller Posvar. Miss

Rick Peridan and Janice Barnett of the Pittstudent Opera.
By SETH LUBOVE

Pinza has had her own professional
career as an opera singer, in addi-
tion to directing a number of pro-
ductions at Duquesne University.
After she started at Pitt, Don
Franklin and Miss Pinza contacted
Buck Favorini, head of the Univer-
sity theatre arts department, to in-
quire into the possibility of co-
producing a student opera.
Previously, the music department
had only offered voice instruction
and music classes, so it was a
necessity to give the voice students
the experience and opportunity to
display their talents, and the perfor-
mance of opera is an integral part
in the training of young singers.
“Clearly, our hope is that

students at Pitt or those planning to

attend Pitt, will be able to best use
their talents in preparation for the.
highly competitive world of opera,
and that student productions such
as these can be used as stepping
stones,” said Klotz. 4
Actually, the concept of student
opera is not new tothis area at all.
Carnegie Mellon University has a
regular opera program which cur-
rently stages two operas every year,_
in addition to providing its students
with workshops which are not
publicly performed. .
«“One of the‘ cast members is
from CMU (Brian Powell), and we
hope that this will be a valuable ad-
dition to his program. We also’ ‘
hope that we’ll be able to continue
sharing talent with CMU,” said
Klotz. . .
Due to severe time limitations on

preparing the production, when
auditioning, the directors were
forced to consider previous ex-
perience of the singers, “but the
most important concern apart from
desire and highlighting Pitt _l
students, was the vocal talent,” said
Klotz.

A Hand of Bridge features Mary
Ricker-Wenk, Ann Marie Silvestri,
Dan Duvall, and Brian Powell. The
Secret of Susanna cast is Rick Peri-
dian and Janice Barnett with Janice
Wieczorek, John Katella, and Eric
Haines. The stage manager is
Carolyn Fenner and at the piano
will be Phyllis Jo Kubey. '

 IMPOSSIBLE ON SATURDAY

1: SUNDAY MARCH 16
1:   ' 8:00 PM ROGAL ROOM JCC

4. Impossible on Saturday is a delightful comedy built around a tour-de-
iorce performance that has seldom been equalled. Archer winsten in The
New York Post called the film "a work so versatile that it bears favorable
comparison with Alec Guinness’ epochal KIND HEARTS AND COR-
ONETS. This is another masterpiece of that same kind.”

According to Pittsburgh
magazine, The Silencers may be close
to securing a recording contract. Pro-
ducer, manager and Pittsburgh
_ native Tom Cossie, who has sat
behind the controls for many Silencer
recording sessions, is currently scour-
ing for a record deal. The Silencers,
composed of lead singer Frank Zuri,
guitarist Warren King, keyboardist
Dennis Takos, bassist Mike Pella and
drummer Ron Foster—certainly
boast a wealth of local rock n’ roll ex-
perience. "Zuri and King were
members of the heavy metal turned
punk collaboration Diamond Reo.
Foster, who served a stint with Sweet
Lightning, has recorded three albums
with Roy Buchanon. Cossie’s creden-
tials include production work on
Sister Sledge’s “We Are Family” and
Chic’s “Le Freak.” Cossie has also
been rumored to be negoiating a
similar deal for Norm Nardini and
the Tigers... The Hell Band
recently called it quits when leader
Pete Stevens took off for Los
Angeles with his songs and tapes.
Bass player Dave Rusnak and drum-
mer Jim Sanmarco have put together

Cover Story

Herman Hartman Promotes Himself To Success

By THOMAS PALMER

Herman Hartman knows people.
That is probably the reason he has
won the Box Office Showmanship
Award twice (the first theater in
Pennsylvania to get such an honor).
That is probably the reason he is
the best promotion man that

., Cinemette has. That is probably

the reason the films at his theater,
the King’s Court, run longer than

any other theater in the Pittsburgh
area.

Hartman came out of a retailing
background of twenty-one years,
starting unloading trucks at age_
nineteen and workeding his way up.
During this time, he studied acting
with the Pittsburgh Playouse, work-
ing out of small local theaters, as
well as doing a bit of directing. His
involvement with the theater was
worked simultaneously with his
retailing career.

Also at this time, Hartman
started a restaurant/theater club at
the Playhouse.

“It didn’t last too_ long, because I
didn’t have enough money,” he
says, sitting in the theater-he has
built up in these two years that he
has been manager; a piece done in
medieval decor, wooden thrones
with red velour, weapons crossing
the walls and a suit of armor
guarding the lobby.

“This was all done while I was
still in retailing. Then, one day, I’d
decided I’d had it and walked out.
The next day I went down to
Cinemette on a job interview and
they hired me, and that’s how it all
started.” " ‘ ‘ ’ ’

‘What had started, unknown to -
Cinemette, was a promotion blitz
from this ex-retailer that turned

King’s Court into a pulsating, ex-
citing money—maker.
Hartman began sending his ideas

‘ down to Cinemette, until the com-

pany ﬁnally gave him a free hand to
work out whatever he wanted with
whatever he had. Now, they call
him to handle promotions outside
of what is playing at his theater, to
ldo promotions for them.

“They called me in for the fish
part of The Fish That Saved Pitts-
burgh. And last year they called me
to be parade master for Walt
Disney’s Sleeping Beauty," and this
year they’ve got me back for The
Lady and the Tramp.

' Hartman has turned the movie_in-

' to more of an event. The ex-

perience starts before the picture
starts to roll, and after the house
lights come up at the end. Especial-
ly true in this case is the
phenomenon of The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.

' “I’ll never forget, I was on the
elevator the day we were going to
open up with Rocky, and this one
manager was coming down and he
said, ‘Oh, you’re getting that pic-
ture. When I was in New York,
they were lined up to get in, and
they were in costumes,’ and I
started thinking, I gotta have people
in costumes. So we started adver-
tising for the first 10 people in
costumes get in free. So the follow- “
ing week, a couple‘ people showed
up in costumes.” N ,

At‘ that_time, Hartman was run-
ning Thank God It’s Friday, a disco
movie with indoor jungle sets.‘

“Before the afternoon and even-
ing‘ performance, we had frofh Con- ' '
tinental Dance Studio demonstra-
tions in disco dancing.“ They had ‘
these leaﬂets I wanted to give out.

Herman Hartman with friends.
. . .trying to keep it fresh.

Well, I got this gorilla costume, and
as the people were leaving, I was
out there dressed as a gorilla giving
the leaflets. And Rocky came along
and there.wasn’t time to change, so
I went on with the gorilla costume
as the MC to pick -out the best

costumes. Then all of a sudden, the '

gorilla became a regular thing.”

The gorilla idea lasted for about a
year, and Hartman switched to the
Purple People Eater. Now he is
looking for an idea for a new MC
as Rocky gets ready to celebrate its
second anniversary.

Hartman says that he will keep
Rocky as long as he continues to
draw the crowds. .

“We try to keep it ‘fresh. We’ve’
had a toga party, and a Rocky

look-alike contest.”
Rocky’s 96th weekend was just
done with a tie-in to the radio sta-
,tion 96KX. For the two year
, anniversary, if all goes well, Hart-
man is planning a parade from
Schenley down Forbes Avenue.
What is in the future for the man
with the profitable ideas.
“Well, I hope that sometime in
near future to start a modeling,

booking and promotion agency. I’d I

also like to produce and direct a
film someday.” ‘ ‘
Yet, Hartman admits, even if he
took on these endeavors, he * 
‘wouldn’t give up his theater. A '
i Possibly it’s something about the
electricity of the place that keeps
him on. ’ . '

fBuck’, Favorini Lays His Cards OnThe Table

By STAN MOYER

"I wrote the play because the two
womenrepresent to me different
parts of myself,” said playwright
and Coordinator of the Theatre
Arts Department at Pitt, Dr. At-
tillio Favorini, “Lillian being the
very pleasure, consumption-oriented
person, and Willa being a h ‘
workaholic.” . ' . «

Talking about Lillian Russell and
Willa Cather, the two main
characters of his new, now playing,
musical drama Hearts and

Diamonds, Favorini", “Buck” to his
"friends, recalled how the play took
form in an effort to do something
about women in Pittsburgh and as a
result of information uncovered
during research for the play
Steel/City, a previous collaboration
between himself and Dr. Gillette
Elvgren, Jr., of the Pitt theatre Arts
Department, also director of Hearts
and Diamonds. ”

“As far as the speciﬁc topic for
Hearts and Diamonds went, it was a
combination of choice and chance.
We (Dr. Elvgren and myself) knew‘
that we wanted to do something
about Lillian Russell because her
face was rivetting when we first saw
it. Rivetting, not that you fall in
love—I’ve never found Lillian to be
a particularly attractive character
the way I find Willa to be an attrac-
tive character; but there’s something
about her that has an aura of
queenliness, of mystery, and we
wanted to find out more about her.
That was the choice part.

“The chance part came when I
found out that Willa Cather, the
novelist, had lived here for ten years
and I started to do research on her,
thinking that maybe she’d be the

. one to do the play about. I

discovered that Willa had been a
drama‘ critic before she became a
novelist and that she had written
reviews many times, on about a
dozen occasions, on Lillian Russell’s
work. She absolutely detested
Lillian.  b

“Willa’s life was about as dif-
ferent from Lillian’s life as any two
lives could be. In one sense Lillian
was famous, outgoing and married
four times while Willa was rather a
reclusive, woman-oriented, possibly
lesbian—although I resist labeling ,
her that way. I think she had a
romantic attraction to women
sometimes and a romantic attraction
to men sometimes and that sex
wasn’t a big part of her life in any
case, that her libido went into her
art.” '-

Favorini, controlled and ar-
ticulate, had begun to move to a
more abstract discussion of his two
main characters, shedding some '
light on the more internal
characteristics of the play.

“There’s recurring imagery of,a
mirror in the play. People are
always looking in mirrors and at
one point, I have a scene when
Willa’s party is on one side of the
stage and Lillian’s on the other and
there’s a mirror that separates the
two. And at one point Willa and
Lillian both converge on the mirror
at the same time, each looking at
herself but actually looking at each
other through the mirror. And
that’s in a sense what I tried to do;
to take images—two different im-
ages—-and make them look at each
other in the mirror.” ' ~

Born and raised in New York
(Greenwich Village), Favorini at-

tended Fordham College in the
Bronx, became President of the
Drama Societyand graduated in

1965. After receiving his Doctorate .

at Yale in August, 1969, he came
directly to the University of Pitts-
burgh in September and has been
heresince. Active in instituting
programs and ‘projects to increase
theatre activity in Pittsburgh, he
was instrumental in forming The I
Floating Theatre, and has not only
a departmental, but also a personal
‘commitment to docudrama, of
which Steel/City and Hearts and
Diamonds are a part. Also,
Favorini is presently Executive Pro-
ducer of both the City Theatre
Company (recently playing Sexual

’ Perversity in Chicago) and the first
annual Shakespeare Festival, com-
ing up this summer.

As for the surge of theatre activi-
ty at Pitt, Favorini said, “There’s
justtremendous potential. We’ve
come a long way. I don’t want to
toot our horn too much but ten
years ago people didn’t even know
that there was any theatre at the
University of Pittsburgh—it was all
CMU. And in those ten years,
times have changed, We're drawing
huge crowds. _ _

“We have some real opportunities
to do things—to do theatre that is
not elitist theatre. ‘All too often in V
my mind theatre preaches to the
coverted; it takes those seven, eight,
ten thousand people who come out
for any theatre event and only
reaches them and ignores the other-
two million that are within forty-
five minutes of Pittsburgh. That’s
ridiculous. If you really genuinely
believe in what theatre can do, then
you have to have as a priority au-

dience development. You just ab-
solutely have to want to go out
there and bring in a new audience
into your theatre. Otherwise,
theatre will die; it'll just atrophy.”
One could be mesmerized by the
dynamic, intense demeanor of
Favorini, the way in which he‘
transmits his excitement for the
. theatre to others. And when asked .
about the possibilities for the
future, he said that he would take a
short break from playwriting and
that there was something that was a
major objective in the department.
“The next thing that I really have
set as a priority for us is to develop
some kind of a television compo-
nent. With cable te_ley_i_s_ion coming

to Pittsburgh, there will suddenly he I

. air time open to us (because of the
community access rights). ’

A Favorini, obviously a strong force
in the Pittsburgh theatre scene, both
amateur and professional, has cer-
tainly proven his ability to further
the cause of theatre. And when
asked how he felt about his ac-
complishments and future
endeavors, he replied, “I feel that I
have been privileged to realize
almost every dream, every vision
that I’ve had here in Pittsburgh. I
have just been in a position where I

i‘ could wish that something would be
and where there were well-wishers
along with me to help make it hap-
pen. And I don’t see any prospect
of that ending.”

And if the success of his past
achievements is any indication of
what may come about in the future,
Pittsburgh will undoubtedly be feel-
ing the presence of “Buck”
Favorini, a major figure in the
cultural expansion of the city.

Mattress Factory Never

By JANE HOLAHAN

Nestled into a residential
community on the North Side of
Pittsburgh, at 500 Sampsonia W33’:
there is an old factory that was onec
a macaroni company, a candy
factory and a mattress maker’s
warehouse. But now named The
Mattress Factory, it has become a A
vibrant, multifaceted home for the
arts

The Mattress Factory was bought
three years ago by sculptor Barbara
Luderowski to serve as a place
where artists (many, like herself
drawn to the North-Side’s diverse
neighborhood) could breath, create,
perform and do what they wanted.
For these‘ past three years it has
remained spontaneous and
welcome to new ideas, and
Assistant Director Joan Kimmel,
who also lives on the North Side
hopes it can stay that way.

‘ ‘We want to say ﬂexible, so that
we can take advantage of the
opportunities that come by,’ ’ says
Kimmel. “If that means not
knowing what’s going to be
happening in three weeks, that’s
okay. The Mattress Factory is
trying to get away from the .
institutional feeling that studios may
have?’

Upon entering The Mattress

‘ Factory it is quite clear that is an

old factory; no effort’ was made to
disguise it, and this is one of its
charms. As you move from floor to
floor on the factory’s original
elevator, you can see a wide range
of facilities, from the art gallery on
the second floor to the weavers
studio on the fourth ﬂoor. There is

Pitt students and faculty cannot
lose themselves in the quiet of a

A pastoral country campus. Constant- '

ly growling traffic, whining sirens, c
and a throbbing business district
noisily compete for space with the
Cathedral of Learning and Pitt’s ‘
other concrete and brick structures.
Oakland's potholes and truck ex-
hausts don’t offer weary minds
much escape or inspiration, but the
soaring sculpture “Upward,” in
front of David Lawrence Hall, the
70-foot mural “Enlightenment and
Joy” in the Forbes Complex, and
the 40-foot mural “Science and
Mankind” in the chemistry building
grab the imagination and make
Pitt’s campus more attractive and
certainly more livable.

The creator of those works and -
many other pieces in the campus
area is not an inaccessible eccentric
hermit. Virgil D. Cantini, who
touches so many Pitt students with

. his art every day, can be found

working in his ofﬁceor making

an unsettled air to the studios which
gives you the feeling that exciting
and creative things are always
happening. ‘

What has made the Mattress
Factory better known to the public
is their small, but active 58-seat
theatre. Such performers as The
Iron Clad Agreement, The Mattress

 Factory Players, mime Dan Kamin
and a New Wave band, Funky Fuje
have performed there, usually to

_ sold out audiences.

“We’ve been very lucky,” says
Kimmel. ‘ ‘We have presented
people who are and are not
establishedand the quality of the
performing has been excellent. We
try to get people involved and
interested. Neighbors can come by
and watch dress rehearsals to see
what we're up to,” she adds.

Kimmel particularly stresses the
involvement of the neighborhood.
“This neighborhood is very vibrant.
Some people have lived here for 60
or 70 years. One neighbor used to
work here when it was a factory and
it’s great to get them involved and
show them what we're doing now. ”

i In fact, The Mattress Factory had
its roots in the neighborhood, for it
started out as a food co-op, where
local artists andneighbors could get
together for a good home cooked
meal. Gradually such local artists as

Louise Pierucci, Henry Hallet and
Murray Kelly set up shop.

Though the community is
supportive, the directors of The
Mattress Factory still feel insecure
about its future. “The community is

' happy and very supporting.” says

Fine Arts Building.

Cantini, a big-shouldered, former
college football player, is chairman
of the studio arts department. His
sculptures, murals, and tapestries-
breathe visual energy into the
Forbes Complex, Hillman Library,
David Lawrence Hall, the Law
Building, the Public Health
Building, and the Natural Sciences
Building.

“I work with metaphor in my
pieces,” Cantini said. “When
Hillman Library opened, the ad-
ministration thought it looked too
clinical and impersonal. They asked
if they could borrow some of my
work. After the opening they
wanted to buy five pieces, including
my tapestry of the rooster I call ‘St.
Peter’s Denial.”

“They wanted another tapestry
and I was trying to think of an ap-
propriate theme. Then I thought of
the bull. The strength of the
university, the very core of it, is its
library. The bull is strong. It was
in the earliest of cave drawings. Its

Kimmel. ‘ ‘The media has been
great about publicity and the mayor
v’ is all for supporting the North

Side’s renovation, but when times
get hard funding the arts is the first
thing to go. We just don’t have
enough money to survive.”
Fortunately the performances,
which not only include theatre, but
alsolﬁlms, poetry readings, and

energy is a radiant force around it.
“My mural in the Forbes Com-
plex I called ‘Enlightenment and
Joy.’ My idea came from the Bible,
V ‘Let there be light.’ Students come
to the university, «are enlightened,
and hopefully joy follows,” he add-
ed. '

The vibrant mural, 70 feet long
and 12 feet high, is one of the
largest works of artist’s enamel in
the world.

Cantini worked with the idea of
universal law in his mural for the
Law Building. The sculpture in
front of David Lawrence Hall is a
tribute to former chancellor Edward
Litchfield. Captured well in the
black metal, its concept is “I work
to the stars.” The modernistic
mural in the chemistry building
deals with science in service of
mankind- '

“What is more beautiful than
chemistry, serving mankind?” Can-
tini asked. “The man and woman
touch and represent the beginning
of life, the first chemical interaction
of cells.”

“To ‘perform’ something means not just
to do it, but to do it with that_ special
dedication and concentration in which a
person gives himself to the thing he does,
allowing it to achieve its full form by allow-
ing it to form him,” explains Peter
Gillespie, owner and manager of the Lion
Walk.

dance classes, are just beginning to
pay for themselves. But proﬁt is not
really the aim of The Mattress
Factory. “We are here because we
love the North Side and we love the
arts,” says Kimmel, and The Mat-
tress Factory enables many talented
local artists to have the freedom to
do what they want, in‘ a place they
love.

“We service over 1,500 students
in our small department. That’s in-
. dicative of the need and wonder-

. ment in the students for art. Art is
another way of communicating. '
Before there was a word, there was

“The university needs big think-
ing, big dreaming. My dream is to
see that parking lot there, the

city of the creative arts with an out-
door amphitheater to cap it off. In
the long run it would be cheaper
than giving us a little wing here, a
little wing there. It’s not good to
be always catching up rather than
leading.‘ The chancellor got behind
the athletics here and it shows. You
can be tops. I’d like to see it hap-
pen to the creative arts.”’

Cantini has more than 18 major
commissions in the Pittsburgh area.
His inﬂuence, as an artist and
educator, inﬁltrates the paths of

Pitt students daily. Most of us 9

don’t realize it.

Cover Story

By PHYLLIS SIGAL

The Boardwalk in Mount
Lebanon doesn’t claim to have a
monopoly on a good time, but it
comes close.

That old favorite board game,
Monopoly, also is the theme here.
Hand-painted wooden plaques of
such game trademarks as water-
works, luxury taxes, go to jail and
free parking, adorn the walls.

Jail bars separate the entrance
way from the way, and a real
Monopoly board announces the
house band, The Parker Brothers,,
which is the name of the company
that manufacturers the original
game as well. ’

As a special treat, women receive
a play $500 bill from the game on
Fridays and Saturdays which entitles
them to free admission on the
following Thursday Ladies’ Night.

Five partners originally bought the
building which formerly housed an
Italian restaurant. They wanted to
convert it to a lounge, which entail-
ed coming up with a name. One of
the owners, noticing the railroad,

the waterworks, the bank, the shop-
ping center and the hotel in the
general vicinity, was reminded of a
Monopoly board. And the Board- .
walk was born. They picked that
particular street from the Monopoly
game because that is the one most
prized and popular.

The business is now owned by
two of the original five partners,
John Galie and Clyde “Butch” _
Villa, Jr. The Boardwalk is their
hobby, not their livelihood. They
used their “imagination to get the
place going,” according to Galie.
“We try to do everything withthe
theme of the game, but the main at-
traction is the band. We wanted to
make a marriage of the band and
the place. The Parker_Brothers
have been successful. Having the
same band every night has been suc-

cessful, too. We wanted to do

something nobody else did by hav-
ing a house band. '

Galie is the unofficial manager of
The Parker Brothers. He and Villa
put the band together, and also ap-
propriately named them to fit in
with the atmosphere of their club.

The Parker. Brothers play under

cabaret-type black and red awnings.
The festive atmosphere and music
invite the crowd to dance, mingle,
and party. Galie classifies the music
as “contemporary, with a jazz
flavor.” The music is good for
dancing, but enjoyable to listen to,
also. “They basically play' jazz,
since they feature brass in every

song. Also versiﬁed music, rhythm S

and blues, and a little rock, to_o.’5’

Ralph Boyle, bartender and
sometimes bouncer, presides over
the very accommodating L-shaped
bar. His comfortable manner
allows you to feel part of the
Monopoly theme whether you’re a
regular or just “landed on” Board-
walk. Everyone calls him Ralph,
and seems to be his friend. He’s
been at the Boardwalk for about
four years.

According to Ralph, about 60
percent of the customers are local
regulars, but many come from
Monroeville, Shadyside, and
Oakland. There is a cross-section
of ages from 20 to 40 years.

He says, "There’s no trouble
here. You don’t have to worry
about fights. We try to weed out

is Marceau: A

Marcel Marceau
Heinz Hall
March 9, ‘1980

By MARK HOLAN

“The world’s greatest non-verbal com-
municator,” Marcel Marceau, made his
seventh Heinz Hall appearance this past
week-end. As usual, it was a delightful
evening for the sold-out audience.

Marceau, France’s undisputed master of
mime, performed seven style pantomimes
from his tour repertoire of 38 pieces. In-
cluded were “The Kite,” “The Cage,”
“Remembrances,” “Contrasts,” “The
Small Cafe” and “The Creation of the
World,” He performed “The
Maskmaker” as an encore piece.

Following intermission, Marceau per-
formed four “Bip” pantomimes: “Bip
Travels by Train,” “Bip as a Great Artist,”

“Bip Hunts Butterﬂies” and “Bip Plays,

David and Goliath.”

Marceau, 53, created Bip in 1947. Dress-
ed in striped pullover and his trademark
opera hat with a red ﬂower, Bip has become
Marceau’s alter-ego; the clown so reminis-
cent of Charles Chaplin’s Little Tramp.

Currently on a two-month, 55-city tour
of the United States, Marceau has become

the wooden floor and installing ﬁre
safeguards, The Dance Gallery opened in
the spring of '77. Currently, the members
of Present Company teach modern dance
and ballet daily, at three levels.

That same spring, Gillespie rented the
main studio to Ann Wyman and Trudy
Scott of The Pennsylvania Repertory
Theatre who wanted a place where they
could sponsor a variety of art. They chose
the name “Lion Walk” because the area,
known as Luna Pagk in the early 1900s, was
the site where a circus lion once took an
“unsupervised stroll.” Fine name and
great idea, but their endeavor lasted less
than a year.

Gillespie, with a PhD in Shakespearean
studies, decided to resign as a writing pro-

"fessor at Pitt in order to sustain and im-
prove the essential concept of the Lion
Walk. Gillespie not only wants to provide
Pittsburgh with a diversity of art, he wants
to present its residents with opportunities to
develop their artistic latencies. This is what
is so exciting about the Lion Walk.

“In addition to performances by accom-
plished artists, we also sponsor a variety of
classes and workshops in which members of
the community can participate directly,”
Gillespie points out.

For example, the first Tuesday of every
month at 8:30 p.m., a poetry workshop,
directed by Michael Wurster of Pittsburgh
Poetry. Exchange, creates a non-academic
atmosphere in which local poets can con-
centrate on creativity without intimidation.
Donations are welcomed, but not required

to join the workshop. The Lion Walk is ‘

also a sponsor for two grants from the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humanities and
the Pennsylvania Council for the Arts,
awarded to the Academy of Prison Arts.
These grants allow for nationally known
poets to attend workshops and give
readings at the State Correctional Institu-
tion at Pittsburgh. While poets such as
‘W.R. Wilkins, Richard Shelton or Robin
Morgan are in town, they also appear at the

Professor Gives Birth To

Lion Walk. Shelton will be reading his
works at the Lion Walk on March 30 at
8:30 p.m.

Right now theater occupies most of the
schedule at the Lion Walk. There are three
different theater groups playing in rotation.
The Pittsburgh Metropolitan Stage Com-
pany, or ‘Metro,’ will be performing Col-
umbia Encyclopedia Presents Mary Stuart
Queen of Scotland, for the final time this
weekend. Then,lApril 4 through April 26,
The Iron Clad Agreement will be presenting
two historical plays, 57 X 2 about H.J.
Heinz and the food processing industry,
along with My Dear Sisters, a drama based
on the Grimke sisters who were abolitionists
from South Carolina in the 19th Century.
The Fine Line theatre group will be doing
the David Mammet play, The’ Water Engine
beginning May 2 and running through May
24. Gillespie plans to have theater continue
through the summer.

With the theater schedule secure, Gilles-
pie has made arrangements to meet with a
variety of people from the Pittsburgh music
community in order to sketch out a series of
concerts ranging from blues to bluegrass to
jazz to chamber to punk. Gillespie com-
ments, “My aim is to provide a place for
people who wouldn’t otherwise have a place
to perform . . . . ..like bagpipers.”

In the near future, attempts will be made
to involve the Lion Walk in a community
service-oriented project. Ideally, this
would include disadvantaged people, both
senior citizens and teenagers who would be
interacting in the same workshop situation,

learning poetry, creative and technical

writing, and acting. -

At the end of May, Catpoto, a women’s
dance collective from ‘Montreal, led by
Deana Davida, will be in Pittsburgh for a
week to demonstrate the concept involved
in Contact Improvisation. Gillespie
describes the dance: “ . . . . ..a new improvi-
sational movement from in which two
dancers, maintaining a point of physical
contact, explore natural movement govern-
ed by gravity, momentum and inertia.”

Hopefully, a Contact workshop will be in
operation before the end of May.

In connection with The Dance Gallery,
the Lion »Walk will offer ballet and creative
movement for children and lessons in the
Martha Graham Technique. For more in-
formation concerning workshops and per-
formances, call 621-7887.

recent book is The’ Story of Bip which
Marceau wrote and illustrated.

Although he has been honored
throughout the world, Marceau’s native
France has recently honored him in two
very important ways. First, he has been
bestowed as a “Chevalier de la Legion
d’Honneur,” France’s greatest honor. Se-
cond, the government has given him a grant
to reopen his International School of

of pantomimists from around the globe,
which hopefully will begin touring in 1982.

words written or spoken, are the true
tributes to the silent master.

Lionwalk

The Lion Walk offers a lot for a little.
The whole idea is to provide the space for
‘diversity in Pittsburgh,’ not to make a pro-
fit. Fees for access to the Lion Walk are
negotiable. Gillespie wants the center to be
self-sufficient—-those who use it pay for it.
His objective is to keep the expense at a
minimum and~his strategy is to keep a max-
imum of scheduled events.

Deathtrap
Directed by Philip Cusack
Heinz Hall
By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

Watching the dramatic performance of
Deathtrap is a lot like trying to find one’s
way through a hall of mirrors. It is

;._delightfully entertaining, filled to the brim
"with laughter and thrills, and the unex-
pected looms overhead, leaving the au-
dience with nothing to do but surmise and
enjoy. The myriad of reflections which
spring up adds an aura of confusion to the
senses, but one can see oneself there, ab-
sorbed by it all, knowing that he will even-
tually find his way out.

It is this process of guessing which incor-
porates the unfaltering attention of the
theatre-goer into a devilishly clever plot,
one that thrives in the world of the theatre
and in the lives of its playwrights.

Deathtrap is a play based on two major
intertwining elements. First, it is about
murder—plotting it, then carrying it out. In
this respect the play is a thriller. Second,
Deathrap is about the writing of a play
which, strangely enough, is exactly that
which appears on stage. In this respect the
play is a mystery—and an inherently funny
one at that. '

The story line resolves around the life of
a middle-aged playwright, Sydney Bruhl
(Donald Barton), who has not written a
smash-hit play for 18 years. He is contacted
by Clifford Anderson (Michael McBride), a
brilliant young playwright, and, after a
series of bizarre events, Anderson becomes
Bruhl’s secretary. Meanwhile, Anderson
begins writing a play that is destined to
become a hit and Bruhl is envious, so much
in fact that he would kill to be the author.

The audience is teased into believing only

Hearts and Diamonds
Directed by Gillette Elvgren
University Theatre

By COLLEEN McDONALD

Take two strong-willed turn-of-the-
century women, one a vibrant actress-
singer—Lillian Russell, the other an in-
tensely private, yet aspiring, young
writer—Willa Cather; set the scene in Pitts-
burgh, add a little music and dancing,

‘:1, have? Hearts and Diamonds!

The new musical documentary, Hearts
and Diamonds, by Atilio Favorini and
directed by Gillette Elvgren opened last Fri-
day at the Stephen Foster Memorial stage,

starring Ginger Auld as Lillian Russell and .

Elaine Carlson as Willa Cather.

Captured in this musical drama are the
personal and professional sides of two
historically famous Pittsburgh figures.

Favorini, coordinator of Pitt’s theater
department, said of his main characters, “I
have taken two entirely different people
and juxtaposed their stories.” Both women
were originally from small home towns,
both strived for success in their prospective
professions, and both came to live in Pitts-

' burgh.

drama unfolds, the complex interplay be-

tween the well-cast characters creates a ten- -

sion which is only relieved at the end.
Several minor characters add a vivacity to
the development, especially Helga ten Dorp
(Marian Baer), who plays a psychic Dutch
woman whose brief humorous interludes
forebode, occasionally inaccurate, in-
cidents which arise later in the play. Bruhl’s
wife Myra (Patricia Guinan) is easily in-
fluenced by her husband's far-fetched ideas
and she helps add charm and credibility to
the script. It is Guinan’s performance in
the opening scene which falters a bit,

Interestingly though, Cather, as a
dramatic critic, viewed Russell as a “plastic
ﬁgure,’,’ having a smile “as cold as winter
moonlight” but the two never met inreal
life. And Favorini does not 5‘force them to
meet.”

Russell (Auld) emerges from “Nellie
Leonard, a freckled-face toe-headed bra ”
into the lights of vaudeville and, finally, she
rises to the top as a striking operetta star.

Auld,‘ a professional Chicago actress does
a lively rendition of Russell. She excels
both with her clear, lilting soprano voice
and her precision acting. Auld’s eerie
resemblance to her character adds to the
image of Russell as a legendary beauty.

Cather (Carlson), the opposing main

character, contrasts Russell’s liveliness with
an intense seriousness. Carlson, a senior
theater major,'gives a powerful display of
Cather through her vivid expressions and
forthright tone of voice.
' A glimpse of Cather’s homosexual
relationship with her Pittsburgh friend,
Isabelle (Julie Massey), is hinted at as the
secretive and reclusive side of the young
writer is revealed. .

Massey, with her light hair and fair com-
plexion, foils Carlson’s appearance _in the
same manner that Isabelle’s “femininity”
foils Cather’s- masculine manner. “Willa

femininity,” explains Favoroni.

As for the supporting members of the
cast, Don Marinelli unfolds as the character
diamond Jim Brady, Russell’s long-
standing friend who has fallen for her
charm. Says Russell when Brady proposes
marriage to her, “Our friendship is too big
to put into a little marriage.”

Gary Grant and Mark Stevenson, as Joe
Weber and Lew Fields, Russell’s show
business buddies, are delightful in their’

frolicsome antics, one always trying to out- '

do the other.

Charming appearances are made by
Marlo Rapp as Little Daughtie and Francis
F avorini as Jack Cather. Both children give
accurate performances.

Cast members Lloyd Arnett, Kathy Brin-
dle, Margaret Durki, Marti Gronski, Peter

nominated in 1978 for a Tony award. The

only question which can be posed after 4

watching Deathtrap is one that involves the
playwright’s purpose. Was the plot solely
contrived to be entertaining and gimmicky,
or was it to point out the unceasing cyclic
human condition which is known , as
avarice? This is the only point which re-
mains unanswered at the final curtain. Per-
haps greed is the deathtrap.

If someone can derive a better" interpreta-

tion of. Deathtrap, everyone else would .

probably beat a path to his door.

Enhancing the show further is the use of
photographic projection" on five large
screens built into the proscenium arch and

backdrop. At various intervals, original"-h

bigger-than-life photographs appear to
parallel each scene.

The chorus and the presence of a 12’-piece

orchestra, directed by Jeffrey Klotz, prove ‘I

wholely professional. Christine Frezza,
musical director, composed and adapted
the plays many lyrics. She-outdoes herself
on the comic “Queen of Divorces,” a song
and dance effort. that “parodies Russell’s
four marriages.”

“Hearts and Diamonds” was inspired by
the success of Favorini’s Steel City, and his
research conducted on a 1978 sabbatical.

“The script came in a burst of creative
energy,” said Favorini,” and has been
rewritten five times since then.”

It’s unique entertainment strongly tied to -

Pittsburgh.‘ Hearts and Diamonds is a
premiere worth experiencing.

Pan)’

By MATT MISKIE

Even if you do not like history, don’t

miss the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Stage
Company in their production of “The,Col-

mbia Encyclopedia Presents Mary Stuart,

.=;- Queen of Scotland.’ ’

The play, written by David Ball, is a

3 clever satire pitting Mary Stuart, played by

usan Cha\pek, and Elizabeth I, played by

- Shirley Tannenbaum, against one another.

The drama, a series of scenes and
ketches, begins with Mary and Elizabeth
itting at opposite ends of a long table

given throughout the play. After the dates
and names are read, the characters
elaborate. Scenes with tourists and tour
guides also help to give historical
background to the action.

Throughout the play the tragedy is
played down by comedy. Most of the
scenes in the play are intensely emotional,

but an ironic twist will be made = and _

laughter emerges from the brink of tears.
The comic parts were played by Ana

Edler, who portrayed Jane Kennedy (nurse

and mistress to Mary Stuart), Jim Boerlin‘-

(who also directed),

Boerlin and Childs played several comic

roles. Most memorable are Boerlin’s

characterizations of Pius VI, Dominic, and ’ .

a demented monk, and Childs’ of Darnley
and Bothwell.
Overall, this is a well-done production

 

  

- which is covered with books. Between the

two queens are two researchers, reading dif-
ferent‘ historical accounts aloud. This is
how most of the historical background is

, The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg

. Public Broadcasting System

' ' Over the year, the PBS has often been ac-
cused of favoring British made prograrnrn-
ing over that of American writers, pro-
ducers, and actors. These accusations were
particularly directed at the dramatic presen-
tation distributed by PBS: The long serials
on Henry the V111 and Elizabeth I;
Upstairs, Downstairs, etc.

Fairly recently though, this reputation
for elitist anglophilism has been put to rest
by a number of dramatic programs. The
renditions of Nathaniel Hawthome’s The

Lathe of Heaven, and the anthology series

of American work getting on American
public television.

As the name implies, The American

tion from well-known American authors in
dramatic form. Well into its new season,
The American Short Story has been suc-

‘Foutains Of

The Fountains Of Paradise
Arthur C. Clarke A
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich

By GEORGE SHANER

Since the 50s, Arthur C. Clarke has been
considered one of the world’s most inﬂuen-
tial science fiction writers. Clarke
specializes in handling tremendous extremes
of time and space and contrasting them

with the spiritual transcendence that.

“man” must bring forth even to begin ex-
ploring them. “The Fountains Of
Paradise” explores this territory again with
Clarke making outright philosophical
statements on “man’s” direction.

The story contrasts the efforts of two
strong-willed men in achieving their highest
ambitions. King Kalidasa seeks to build a
paradise on Earth, much in the manner
Kubla Khan and Xanadu. Standing in his
path is -a group of stubborn Buddhist
monks who put a curse on him. Two thou-
sand years later, Vannevar Morgan is forc-
ed to contend with the same order of monks
over the site of the monk’s monastery.
Morgan needs the site for a literal tower in-
to space, and the monks will not leave.

Taking place on the island of Taprobane
(based on Sri Lanka). Clarke makes the
story into a conflict between human ra-

story’s presentation. Harris, a resident of
Pittsburgh, is best known for his sports
stories. In particular, he’s famous for the
novel Bang the Drum Slowly, a story that
itself was dramatized as a film. Besides his

defenses to build up and reality to become
distorted.

The egos in this novel are those of the
academe world, where sensitivity and
creativity subsist symbiotically. The setting
is tiny Woodslee College, an almost-Ivy
League institution where the egos of
prestigious poets, musicians and novelists

tionality and the end of mystical religion.
As Clarke has suggested in previous
stories—and straight-out states in “The
Fountains”—organized religion is “pious
gibberish with which apparently intelligent
men have addled their minds for
centuries.” This finish is brought about by
the appearance of an alien spaceprobe
which lays low “man’s” lingering hopes for
an anthropomorphic god. Indeed, the
whole story is a tale about the
transcendence of human thought and
human achievement.

This triumph is best symbolized by the
monks giving up their sacred ground for ap-
parently irrational reasons, while Morgan
gazes on in astonishment. This sums up the
main thread of the story in which Kalidasa
fails and Morgan wins, even though it costs
both of them their lives.

From this climax, the story seems to wind
down with the actual construction of the
tower but ends with Morgan’s own personal
finish having reached his goal.

As always, Clarke is not a master of
strong and vital characterization; Only
Morgan has a life of his own. Clarke is a
master, though, of strong prose and well-
paced stories. These qualities of strong
tales and vast intellectual vistas have made
Clarke’s works popular, and have brought
him much honor.

of his later work. At this time, the United
States was just becoming a major power,
and there was no shortage of self-righteous
citizenship. To a certain extent, the story
was written in reaction to this smug at-
titude.

As something of this attitude is coming
back into style, this story fits the times
perfectly. Particularly the way it merciless-
ly lampoons the hollow morality of the
citizens. ’

In his adaptation of the story, Mr. Harris
has somewhat lightened the tone of gleeful
revenge. In the original, the couple that is
the stranger’s tool of vengeance dies in
guilt. In the adaptation, they come out of
the plot in doubt, but retaining some of
their honor.

In contrast to the original in which the
stranger was a shadow lurking in the
background, letting the people trip along in
his absence, the adaptation allows the
stranger to become the main character. This
is partly because the stranger plays the nar-
rator, and partly because it aids the ﬂow of
the story.

Robert Preston plays the wronged
stranger in the story with great relish, often
resembling Mark Twain ‘himself (a
resemblence he tried to minimize). The

‘The Black Stallion’ A Contender In The Film World

The Black Stallion
Directed by Carroll Ballard

By THOMAS M. PALMER

The rating system for films was probably
the worst setback suffered by the industry
in its short history. Anything marked with
a “G” usually is qualified and categorized
well before the audience sees it, with only a
few exceptions. Let us hope that one of
these exceptions is The Black Stallion.

The story is fairy tale. Alex (an uncom-
monly freckled Kelly Reno) is the only sur-
vivor of an ocean liner disaster off the coast
of North Africa. Near to drowning as the
crippled ship ﬂoats away, Alex sees the
horse that was being transported on board,
ﬂoundering in the water, and grabs on to
one ‘of its ropes.

He wakes up sprawled on beach, and
finally, what Director Ballard was setting us
up for in the beginning of the film starts to
take shape on the screen and race with our
senses.

What wins in the film is Ballard’s touch
for sensory appeal. His scenes are a

‘Just Tell Me’ Loses Its Theme In Framework .

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

Just Tell Me What You Want
Directed by Sydney Lumet

. When is a comedy not a comedy?
Answer: When it’s almost totally serious. It
is a shame that the promoters of Just Tell
Me What You Want billed the ﬁlm as a
comedy, especially after discovering that it
succeeds in being a high-quality, fairly well-
aimed piece of serious film-making.

The comedian Alan King is cast as the

, penultimate businessman Max Hershel, an

unbelievably affluent, yet grotesquely

‘ humorous individual whose only ﬂaws are
his egotism, which seldom hurts anyone '

severely, and his neglect of love, which
causes the mutually painful separation from

choreography of feeling and nature; a
dance of attitude leaping from horizons to
‘wildlife. Ballard’s scenes are portraits.
They go beyond the canvas-type beauty of
Terence Malick’s Days of Heaven in that
Malick’s pictures were more familiar
recreations, while Ballard’s are cinematic
orginals. He captures the pulse of sunsets
and forceful skies of billowy clouds in an
incredibly striking way. Malick seems to
dispel an unwritten idea that it would be
fruitless to try to caputre a Van Gogh or
Degas on the screen, while Ballard makes it
difficult to imagine either of those greats

putting his visual celluloid images on can-'

.vas. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel
does a painstakingly rewarding job, and
combined with the editing of Robert Dalva,

create a mystical visage that often times A

goes untapped by other filmmakers.
Ballard also shows a patience and
delicacy in detail. The scene on the beach
where boy and horse finally establish each
others trust is an amazing dance of indeci-
sion betweenthe pair, and yet, is done in
one long, uncut shot. Ballard keeps his
camera steady and waiting, not taking snat-
ches and editing it all together. One can

McGraw). Hershel’s wife is in California,

shel being in New York, had taken up the
only living thing that mattered to him
beyond the office, and because of his fer-
vent devotion to his enterprise, he loses her

feel the director’s force of purpose and in-
credible adherence to an idea. The scenes
of the two stranded was ﬁlmed in Sardinia,
all with Ballard’s careful balance of nature
and narrative perspective through the eyes
of Alex. The ship disaster and’ adaptation
to a lonely, foreign environment are as
striking to the audience as they are to the
boy.

Included in all this is Ballard’s test for
movement. His camera makes us feel the
faltering ship, the freeness of diving and
running through the water, as well as ride
on the stallion itself. Combined with the
score. of Carmine Coppola (Producer Fran-
cis Ford’s brother), The Black Stallion is

i like a vast ballet on ﬁlm.

But Ballard does not over-indulge in the
limitlesspossibilities of his magical Sardinia
setting. The pair is rescued and get back to
an anonymous city: mid-forties America.
The shooting, however, is done in Canada
(where Malick constructed the beauty of his
Days of Heaven). . '

several seemingly unavoidable cir-
cumstances, both ﬁnd that they have loved
each other all along.
It is King’s quite competent performance

xwhich holds the ﬁhn in place, making each
startlingly brutal crisis seem relatively easy
to manage. Part of this, however, lies with
the character Hershel, whose emotions
vacillate, coursing the gamut from concern
to hair-trigger irascibility. His ﬂare-ups are
a bit grandiose, however, and the character
loses credibility, leaving the audience to sur-
mise whether or not the ﬁlm has intended to
establish these feelings. His expletive-laden
epigrams also detract from the ﬁlm, not
because of their vulgarity but as a result of
the cuteness with which they are delivered,
a style. of humor hardly typical of the
overachieving entrepreneur that he is. Also
interspersed throughout the film are
slapstick sequences, quite frankly, of the
Walt Disney variety.
thankfully brief and relatively trivial faults,
however, is fairly easy, and the rest of the
movie is not disappointing.

McGraw offers a consistent character:
hopeful, ambitious, knowledgeable, and
terse. She works quite well with King in
scenes which are conﬂict-ridden, but at

Ashby Takes
-‘Being There’

Being There -
Directed by Hal Ashby

By STAN MOYER

Picture a middle-aged man isolated from
the world all his life, whose only activity has
been gardening and whose only knowledge
has been acquired by watching television.
What if he was forced from his garden and

i made to fend for himself in the outside

world? The film Being There, directed by
Hal Ashby and adapted for the screen by
Jerzy Kosinski from his novel of the same
name develops that “what if” and takes us
on a comical journey through the American
consciousness.

The middle-aged man is appropriately
named Chance (Peter Sellers); and he loves
his television; there’s one in his bedroom,
the living room, dining room, garage and
garden. But almost as soon as we meet
Chance he must leave his sanctuary because
the “old man” has died and there’s not a
mention of Chance in his will.

Amazed at what is beyond the closed
doors of hislprevious life, Chance wonders
through a black ghetto of Washington D.C.
In a funny, revealing scene in which he is

the separation from Hershel; ' When she

All the characters in this ﬁlm are played

BEGIN.

Rock n’ roll, in its truest sense, has
always fought for the most humanistic ex-
pression—from the rigors of society, the
pressures of conformity, the oppressions of
boredom and, most recently, the onslaught
of technology.

When the electric guitar arrived on the
scene, the music was revolutionized to a
point where human heart and soul were in
direct competition with machine watts and
decibles.

To their credit, the most admirable rock
n’ rollers graced the coming electronics but
still depended upon plain ol’ sweat, passion

’ and guts to guide their music.

But now the l980_’s have dawned and the
computer and digital ages are also on the

' horizon. So where do we go from here?

Gary Numan offers one unique but alarm-
ing direction. ‘-

As a self-proclaimed artist of the future,
Gary Numan precariously teeters between
ﬂesh and blood, and nuts and bolts. That
suspicions should arise concerning his

« humanity contradicts rock n’ roll’s basic

ideals. Instead of incorporating the
elecronic gimmickry, Numan exploits it and
makes himself appear as just another
machine. It may be an act but his adoring

fans ate it up without questioning what they

were losing.
On stage at the Stanley Theatre, Numan

was a creepy combination of pop star 4

powerand methodic android. He seemed

‘intent on establishing himself as a robot-
like entertainer—coy, and unemotional, he

lacked any warmth for or rapport with an

audience in obvious adulation of him.
His music, .sometimes charming, more

‘ often samey, was electronic and stream-

lined, filled with fear and, paranoia and
delivered with deliberate dead-pan vocals.
His stage presence was distant and
detached. On the three separate instances
he managed to crack a smile, his toothy grin
appeared ridiculously out of character.
Perspiration was like an inconvenience to
him but went largely unnoticed behind the

white caked make—up and jet black»

clothing.

Communication with the audience,
which did not come until the midpoint of
the show, was minimal but for a few
“thank-yous” and a couple of “good-
nights,” and of course, the one-word in-‘
troduction of “Conversation.” So clever.

His 16-song set is hardly worth recoun-
ting‘. Song titles seemed unimportant ex-
cept for the three that received repeated
cries of request; “Are Friends Electric?,”
“Praying to the Aliens,” and most especial-
ly, “Cars.” Other Numantunes merely
drifted in and out and around the space-age

special effects that were, at least for awhile,
far more interesting than what the “man,”
himself had to offer.

Picture if you can a New Wave
Hollywood Squares set-up and you would
get an idea of the stage set-up that
dramatically greeted the screaming and anx-

_ ious Stanley throng. Synthesizer men Den-

nis Haines and Christopher Payne, along
with drummer Cedric Sharpley, were
elevated in split-level platforms that blinked
horizontal bars of color like an acid-
tripping marquee. I
Bassman Paul Gardiner and
guitarist/percussionist/synthesizer Rrussell

Bell stood stage level with heir Numan, who ‘

opened the show hidden behind a massive
array of keyboards. For most of the rest of
the evening, Numan leisurely paced across

one side’ of the stage to the other, his

movements cautious and restrained.
After the awesome opening of dry ice,
light, .color, men and machines, the

More Electric

elaborate special effects grew tiresome and
the music, tedious. The set drastically bot-
tomed out towards the middle and only
picked up again near the evening’s conclu-

sion.

In keeping with his automation amore,

' Numan ended his show by dancing and

cavorting with a pair of pirovetting

pyramids similar to those on the cover of p

‘ ‘The Pleasure Principle. ’ ’

One-man band, opening act and outland-
ish showman, Nash the Slash from Toron-
to was in a word—ah, different. Dressed in
basic white, tails, tophat, gloves, cloth face
mask and dark glasses, Nash was an eerie,
ominous presence on stage.

His music was even spookier.

Projecting himself like a punk rock
Phantom of the Opera, Nash blended chill-
ing, haunting vocals with bizzare visual ef-
fects. He switched from, and sometimes

‘simultaneously played guitar, synthesizer
and violin. His 30-minute set ‘was
highlighted by a horror version of “Baba
O’Riley,” which found Nash pulling a killer

Who riff out of his violin. Strange but fun, .

Nash was a perfect beginning for what was
to come.

As for Numan, his instant popularity
seems to be a case of curious cultural
phenomenon that struck the right societal
chord. Less than a year ago, he was a strug-
gling avant-gardist. Now he’s on the verge
of international stardom. F

He has been quoted as saying his man-
nerisms on stage are extensions of the con-
cepts he builds in his songs.

“If you're going to
something, you’ve got to look it so the au-
dience knows what’s in your mind,” he
said. '’

Numan must be wary of taking himself
too seriously, orelse be swallowed up in his-
own hype like David, Bowie. Numan, like_
Bowie, has fabricated a unique and clever
concept for modern man. _

But, ultimately, one that’s scary as hell,
too. - .

Prismatic’s Blend Of Music Justifies TheirName

Prismatic
David Iawrenee Hall
February 28, 1980

, By rnrms SIGAL ‘

Prismatic is several vibrations coming
back to" one source. According to vocalist
and guitarist Micheal Colone, the whole
of Prismatic is tuned in to this concept.
All types of music-jazz, rock, Middle
Eastern. Latin American, and calypso-
are fused to make one sound, which is
termed “prismatic music.”

The show Thursday night opened with
the six members of Prismatic walking

~ down the left aisle of David Lawrence’s
auditorium to the sound of bells and loud,

I rhythmic foot steps. The bells were tied
around Roberto Kuypers’ ankle. _He
continued to keep the beat on his set of
congas for the duration of their
performance.

Colone’s opening words to the
audience were, “We want to blend a lot
of "different styles to present the music as
prismatically as possible. ”

Then the blending began.

Percussionist, vocalist, and “trance-
motionist,” Peneluna an interesting
looking woman, with beaded hair,
sequined scarf, and gypsy-like blue

dress, controlled her array of nearly 40
percussion instruments.

She danced, swayed, and flowed
around the stage while playing her
chimes, triangle, bells, moroccas, etc.,

with Egyptian to Island rock to jazz ‘

rhythms. She whistled, hooted, moaned,
and sometimes sang the few lyrics of thier
songs.
Their opening song, “Congas,’.’
featured Kuypers ‘on his congas. p David
-Reinstein came in with his powerful

 

soprano saxophone, while Peneluna beat
her rhythm sticks.

The six members seemed to be very
aware of each other while they
performed, communicating throughout
the duration of the songs, although, Joe
Braus on bass guitar was more involved '
in his own instrument, with his dark and
mysterious appearance. Tom “Crafty”
Kalep added to the strong rhythm
section, while hidden behind his drum
set.

“When We Get There,” a single the
band had released last fall was a light jazz
instrumental, with a latin ﬂavor. This
song led into a frantic tune, “Father
Nothing,” reminiscent of a tribal dance or
Reggae. The lyrics -were practically
obscured by the overpowering percussio
on this tune. - A

A song called “Don’t Ask Me Why”
was dedicated to “anyone who goes to
college.” Colone in his introduction ‘to
the song claimed that “if you ask the right
question, you’ll get the right answer.”
The lyrics consisted of the one line repeti-
tion of the title. The audience was also
warned by Colone that Kuypers
sometimes "gets a little crazy on this V
song.” He did. He shook his body wild-
ly, jerking as if under strobe lights. Then
he stood up, looking a bit like Franken-
stein or an African witch doctor, and with
a very deep voice began to shout the
words louder and louder, hysterically, as
he lumbered into the audience. _

After practically attacking a few girls in
the front row, he then infringed on some
of the people on the aisle. Of course it
was all in fun. The crowd seemed to be
amused.

The most dramatic song of the evening
came near the end of the show when only
25 people were left in the audience. Band A
members donned dark glasses, with a

mock punk attitude. Peneluna began
“Little Voices,” breathing heavily into the
microphone, I looking as if she might
swallow it. She then began enjoying her
body, as her body began enjoying the
microphone stand. The song ended as
she screeched; satiated by the music,
maybe.

’ The small crowd seemed to enjoy the
music, even though it started out as 150
but slowly and steadily dwindled. They

played for about three hours, which
seemed a bit long, a fact which may have
accounted for the loss of audience.

Prismatic closed their concert by
clapping their hands, asking for the
audience to join them.

“Feel the music. Let the music happen
inside you,” were their parting words.

Prismatic is different, energetic and
innovative. If you weren’t there, you
missed a good one! ‘

Sloppy Performance By UFO
Micheal Schenker Come Back

UFO/ Off Broadway
Stanley Theater
March 4, 1980

By MARK MON AHAN

Anyone whose been a fan of veteran
British rockers UFO must have been heart-
broken after their recent appearance -in
Pittsburgh at , a‘ near capacity Stanley
Theater.

The band was sloppy and indifferent the
whole night, the power went off in the mid-
dle of “Rock Bottom” and “Lights Out,”
their two most popular songs, and without
German Michel Schenker, their brilliant ex-
lead guitarist, the band just doesn’t sound
as good as it did two years ago.

As rock bands go, UFO have always been
a no frills, hard rocking, straight ahead five
piece band obsessed with delivering power
packed and no nonsense rock’n’roll.

However, beneath this up front and ag-
gressive Streetwise approach, UFO has
always been a band. with a brain.

Their albums are not just packed with
three chords and a cloudof dust rockers,
their album covers are unique and im-

aginative, designed by British masters Hip- A

gnosis, and their song arrangements-and
stage presentation have been just about as
entertaining as any band in the hard rock
field over the last five years.

But without Schenker’s guitar work, the
band is unquestionably missing the key in-
gredient which defined their sound, and
would have made them rock superstars, had
he stayed with the band, instead of the
journeyman rockers they now are.

New guitarist Paul Chapman is a mildly
talented guitarist who simply doesn’t have
the chops to hammer home the killer’s in
UFO’s set, “Too Hot to Handle,” “Light’s
Out,” “Rock Bottom” and “Shoot,
Shoot.”

As for the restof the band, being season-
ed performers, their performance at the
Stanley was acceptable, but they simply
don’t seem to have the spirit or drive they
displayed on earlier tours.

‘Vocalist Phil Mogg was his usual, “I
don’t give a damn” self, cooly stalking the
stage, twirling his mike stand while deliver-
ing powerful vocal performances on “Love
to Love,” “Only You Can Rock Me” and
4 “Cherry.”

Madman bassist Pete Way was posessed

Ronnie Laws/Lenny White i
Stanley Theatre
February 27, 1980

By WALTER WATSON

There appears to be a thin line between

jazz music and danceable rhythms.
Granted, all jazz is not meant to be danced
to nor is all danceable music jazz. Ronnie

__Laws and Lenny White were great tightrope
" ‘walkers at the Stanley Theatre two weeks

ago. White and Laws should be hailed for
not allowing the demands of jazz purists or
disco advocates to cramp their styles at
either extreme. Each artist performed a
repertoire that reached out and touched
both entities in the Pittsburgh crowd.

T wennynine, featuring Lenny White,
gave the people what was often unexpected,
but nonetheless satisfying. White, the
former jazz/ rock pacemaker for Return To
Forever, played music from the Streamline
lp as well as the Best of Friends album.
Both records have material that exposes a
variety of music styles and genres. The
material that White and the eight member
group chose to play was quickly accepted

tablished audience. “I think we’re getting- a
great deal of positive response from au-
diences all over the country,” said White
after his performance. “And I think more
people will know Twennynine by the time
we go on the road again.” ‘

During an extended intermission, the
crowd became impatient. White was more
than a warm—up act, perhaps overheating
the audience, taking from them much of the
energy that had been brought to the Stanley
for Ronnie Laws. Laws’ equipment and
group were late getting to Pittsburgh, and
the long wait gave most ticketholders time
to recuperate and catch their breaths.

When Laws ﬁnally mounted the stage at
10:50 p.m. (the concert started at 8 p.m.),
equal doses of consideration and satisfac-
tion were exchanged between performer
and audience.

Laws ‘opened with “These Days” from
last year’s Flame album and let the audience

worked perfectly for Forbert during his
90-minute performance. Equipped with his
harmonica in a rack, acoustic and electric
guitar, Forbert developed a rapport early
with the very well-behaved and conservative
audience. Flashing an impish grin, he work-
ed the crowd to his advantage while ex-
perimenting with the order and selection of
tunes. As a-headline act with no support
group, Forbert was allowed much room to
breathe and the opportunity to really be

_ himself onstage.

The upbeat folk rocker “Go-
ing Down to Laurel” opened
the show. This was excellent
choice for an "opening number
and is also the first cut on the first side of
Forbert’s debut album Alive on Arrival.

Next was the first of two versions of the -

folk ballad “Thinking,” this time an elec-
tric rendition, and later _done by Forbert
alone as an acoustic piece. Forbert con-

Once upon a time. . . .. _
Back in the early ’70’s, as a reaction to

. the standard MOR schlock, heavy metal

and glitter rock that abounded, a bunch of
from New York’s outer

groups. They called themselves the New

I ‘ York Dolls and quickly gained infamous
, notoriety onthat city's scuzz-club circuit.

‘ . The Dolls took their androgynous, drag-
queen image from the Rolling Stones circa

A‘ 1973 and theirraunchy R&B music from the

same source circa 1964. Lead singer David
Johansen was a dead ringer for Mick Jag-
ger, while guitarist Johnny Thunders
resembled Keith Richards in both his on-
stage playing style and off-stage junkie life-
style.

After much internal feuding, manage-
ment and record company hassles, drugs,
chronic chaos and a basic misunderstanding
by the kids whom were shelling out for the

._ MOR, heavy metal and glitter rock anyway,

the Dolls grinded to a deranged but in-
definite halt in 1975.

But from the ashes, the five members of
the Dolls have risen again to find their
respective places in the more acceptable
New Wave, a movement they inspired
almost ten years ago.

"Johansen has recorded two tough albums
that have leaned heavily into an R&B/ soul
direction. Thunders and drummer Jerry

Ads for the new album warn ’
“Aerosmith gets you where it
hurts. . . . .Night in the Ruts gets you
right in the nuts.” And it’s no sur-
prise.

Aerosmith’s latest releast Night in
the Ruts is packed with hard hitting
rock that the band is famous for.
With six platinum albums to their
merit, Aerosmith has proven that
they can deliver the goods. This
latest release has not only marked
the end of a decade for the band,
but also the last with lead guitarist
and main contributer Joe Perry.

Perry recently exited from the
group to pursue a solo career while .
Jimmy Crespo, lately of Flame, has
filled Joe’s void since then.

On the latest album, Perry’s
guitar work has improved and
matured, but frequently lacks

LIVE AT MAX‘S KANSAS CITY
The Heartbreakers
Jem - . -

By SAM MATHEWS

In the early ’70’s, the New York Dolls
were all alone. They came between the late

best songs are‘ the apocalyptic
“Mercenaries” and the chestnut
“Walking The Dog,” given
freshness by Cale’s Morrison-like
voice.

Side two is the “artistic” side of
the album. “Chorale” and “Only
Time Will Tell” are mid-tempo
pieces with orchestral overtones.
Also on this side is the title track,
Sab/Jtage, a number which comes
close to being arty noise; and also,
it is the only song which comes
close to being a loser on the album.

Overall, this is a strong comeback
for John Cale. If there is any
justice, this should be an artistic
and commercial success for him.
No garbage here. '

Shankar Has  
Right Touch

TOUCH ME THERE
L. Shankar

Zappa

Indian violinist L. Shankar was
introduced to the U.S. music scene
by master guitarist John
MacLaughlin, along with producer
Frank Zappa.

As an average violinist, Shankar’s
styling is in his favor. The album’s
lead cut “Dead Girls of London”
was written by Shankar with funny,
typical Zappa lyrics. . . ‘ ‘maybe it’s
the warm water/maybe it’s the
tea/maybe it’s the ‘way they was

Thunders

’60’s punk explosion of Iggy Pop and the
Stooges and the MC5, and prior to the cur-
rent new wave scene. Coupled with their
misunderstood image, musically they were
the total opposite of the then current trend
of mellow, acoustic C,S,N, and Y.

Termed “the American. Rolling Stones,”
the Dolls released two albums and burned
out. A definite case of too much, too soon.

Since then, guitarist Johnny Thunders
has gone through serious drug problems
and a number of versions of his present
band, the Heartbreakers. Currently, when
Thunders and Co. need survival money,
the Heartbreakers line up a few shows per
month. The Heartbreakers—Live at Max ’s
Kansas City document is one of those
shows.

Recorded during the fall of 1979, the
Heartbreakers sound unrehearsed (in the
sense of the Faces). The Heartbreakers
(who consist of Ty Styx, drums; Billy Rath,
bass; Walter Lure, guitar; and Thunders,
guitar and vocals) use this sloppiness to
their advantage. ,

Styx, Rath and Lure pound out the
power chords to each’ song and allow
Thunders to go crazy. As a guitarist,
Thunders screams. He is not technically
polished but original. Playing like Keith
Richards on speed, Thunders’ leads
dominate the band and album.

The playing and attack on such songs as
“Milk Me” (a re-make of the Dolls’ “Chat-
terbox”), “One Track Mind,” “All By
Myself” and .“I Wanna Be Loved,” stand
out. At times, vocal cues are missed or
songs hesitantly begun. These things get
ironed out and the Heartbreakers score.
Truely a garage band in the finest sense of
the word, they value raw energy _and at-
titude over technical perfection.

Heartbreakers—Live at Max’s succeeds
as a documentary of a band playing like
they enjoy themselves. Drunken, rowdy,
and powerful, the Heartbreakers "don’t
compromise themselves or their music. Like
the Dolls, playing with -an intensity of a
garage mechanic tuning a carburetor, the

-Heartbreakers manage to turn what would

be liabilities in most bands, into assets.

The Heartbreakers are the bastard
children of the New York Dolls. There’s no
better recommendation than that.

raised/All the dead girls of Lon-
don/why do they act that way...”

“Windy Morning” is a mellow
tune in which Shankar shows his
best violin technique. “Knee Deep
In Heaters” is very interesting as a
sort- of reggae-mideastern hybrid
with Zappa lyrics and Shankar sing-
ing with a strange vocal approach.
“Little Stinker” and “Darlene” are
well composed upbeat rockers which
really say something for Shankar’s-
ability as a composer.

“Touch Me There” is a_very
mellow Shankar tune, with Zappa
lyrics, and a nice vocal touch done
by Jenny Lautrec, who almost
sounds like Libby Titus. “No More
Mr. Nice" Girl” may be the real gem
of the album. The melody is direct
and simple, with a tight rhythm sec-
tion and nice improvision on piano,
accordion and violin. The album
ends with Shankar’s very gentle
“Love Gone Away.”

Shankar’s overall violin technique
is not the greatest butit fits his
great compositions.) Zappa’s lyrics
on “Dead Girls Of London,”
“Knee Deep In Heaters” and
“Touch Me There” are Zappa at
his best and show something he has
been known to lack, class. Another
good thing is that Zappa does no
singing (thank goodness for small
favors).

Touch Me There is a truly great
L.P. and should fit the tastes of
both the jazz and rockalovers.
Everyone should have thisalbum.
