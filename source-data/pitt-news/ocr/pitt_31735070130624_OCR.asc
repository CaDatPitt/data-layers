Instead of spending his anniversary
on a romantic date with his lover of 12
years, Mark Friedman was picketing in
front of the Eat ‘11 Park on Murray
Avenue. .

Friedman joined more than 30 Pitt
students, professors and members of’ the
neighboring community at a rally spon-
sored by the Equal Rights Alliance, in
front of the Squirrel Hill restaurant
"Sunday afternoon.

Demonstrators ’ gathered in front of
the restaurant to protest Pitt’s refusal to

grant health benefits to same—sex part— ,

nets of University employees.

The University has been mired in
scrutiny and legal battles since former
professor Deborah Henson sued the
University in January 1996, claiming the
University violated the Pittsburgh
Human Relations Act, which includes a
1990 gay-rights ordinance banning
employment discrimination — including
benefits allocation — based on sexual
orientation. ’ I

“[This is] clearly unequal treatment
[and] unequal benefits for_equal work,”
said Friedman, a member of the Coalition
Against Discrimination at Pitt, a non—stu—
dent group that works closely with the
ERA. ‘ ’ A

Members of the ERA and the coali-
tion held the rally in front of the popular
restaurant to gain the attention of Pitt
trustee, Suzanne Broadhurst. Broadhurst
is Eat ‘n Park’s director of corporate giv-
ing, and is married to Eat ‘n Park CEO,
James Broadhurst.

In a leaflet handed out to passersby
and patrons of the restaurant, ERA"

/ explained, “No, we’re not protesting Eat

‘n Park. We are here to call on University
of Pittsburgh Trustee Suzanne
Broadhurst to take » action and end dis-
crimination against gays at the
University of Pittsburgh  Silence is
complicity.” . -
While Broadhurst was not actually
inside, protestor Max Schnurer, a gradu-
ate student "studying communications,

said, “I suspect ,she’ll probably get the

message.”

With two out of every 1000 col-

lege students infected with the HIV-

virus, AIDS has become the disease
of today’s college generation.

These findings, which some
believe are too conservative, are
derived from a five-year—old study
by the American College Health
Association. _

The World Health Organization
considers last year’s statistics under-
estimated, designating AIDS as the
world’s fastest-growing epidemic.

A team of 20 employees from
Pitt Telefund will participate in the
AIDS Walk 2000 this Sunday. The
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, who is
sponsoring the walk, estimates the

walk will ‘generate as much as.

$250,000.

The proceeds of the 3,000-4,000
total participants will be used to pro-
vide direct care, education and pre-
vention to stop the AIDS epidemic.

The walk begins at 10 a.m. on
Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park.
After circling through Squirrel Hill,
it finishes .with a picnic back at
Flagstaff Hill. T

Telefund team captain Michael
Bell devised the idea to participate
in the walk after serving as Telefund
manager and PATF volunteer for
several years. Bell’s interest in the
disease developed from watching it
claim the lives of several/people he
admired. .. I I

“ Freddie Mercury had the out-‘
right temerity to die (of AIDS) on
my birthday,” Bell said.

One of Bell’s favorite hockey
talents, former North Stars player
Bill Goldsworthy, also died of AIDS.

“With all of the new infections,
the burden of the task force is huge.
[Supporting AIDS] is no longer the
fashionable thing it used to be, but
the ‘need for help is greater than it
ever was,” Bell said."

, The Telefund is still recruiting

  money and awareness

new team members and volunteers
who are willing to pledge financial
support to walkers. I

“A lot of people think this is a
gay disease, but it’s a, youth dis-
ease,” Bell said, citing PATF statis-
tics indicating that half of all new
HIV infections in the United States
are among people under 25 years
old. “And ‘a lot of people think it’s
not going to happen to them.”

To help counteract this, PATF I

disseminates prevention literature,
condoms and runs a prevention clin-

. ic throughout the year.

It also runs a “Med Pals” pro-

gram where volunteers help recently

diagnosed patients learn to take their

medication. Since AIDS medications .

have severe side effects such as nau-

sea and a loss of feeling in extremi— ‘

ties, many patients need such
encouragement to continue taking
their pills.

Telefund AIDS walk team mem-
ber Rob Sully, a Pitt freshman,
emphasizes the need for all citizens
to contribute to curbing the spread of
the disease.

“Everyone needs to. do their
part,” he said. “You don’t need to be
a scientist in a lab to help out.”

Nancy Commella, PATF director 

of communications," said the number

of teamshas increased this year.’

Since the disease is focusing . on
young adults, she wants to see more
adults participating in activities like
the walk. '

The Center for Disease Control

statistics report that there are 22,225

cases of AIDS in the Pittsburgh‘.

Area, which includes Allegheny,
Fayette, I Washington, and
Westmoreland, counties, Commella
said.

But Pennsylvania state law does ‘

not require HIV cases to be reported

A to the state,'she said. This results in

much lower numbers of infection
than actually exist, she added.

Staff Writer

Last week The Pitt News ran part
one of a two part series regarding
the medical aspects of cloning and
genetic research. ‘

’ For Rev. Dawn Check, adviser to
the United Campus Ministry at Pitt
cloning and genetic research is an
issue much deeper than simply right
or wrong.

“I think there are issues for
Christians that are not clear-cut and
this is one of them,” says Check.

Many other groups are also torn
between the possibility that the
cloning of animals could bring bene-
fits to society, like more organs for
transplant patients.

But on the other hand, they are
afraid that cloning will get out
of control and be used for unneces-
sary purposes.

Check feels that if cloning would
save her children’s lives someday,
then cloning might not be a bad
thing.

Laura Pascucci,_ a member of the

“Who knows” says Pascucci, “I

group

But when it comes to the subject-

of cloning humans, most groups are
very clear on where they stand‘.
Pastor Scott Kuechenmeister, the
adviser for the Lutheran University
Center, does not see whatgood‘

own hearts. .

“You can clone Michael Jordan,”
jokes Juda. “But that does not mean
that the clone is going to want to
play ball or sell fragrances.”

Many of the religious groups
agree that parents picking traits such’

as eye color or height for their

unborn child is unnecessary. Juda
believes we should not allow parents
to ﬂatter their own ego at the

“The cloning of a human would not
produce the same‘, human anyway
because of all of the environmental
factors that go into making a person
who theyare.” \
-Aaron Juda, a Jewish student at
Pitt, compares the cloning of a per-
son to identical twins. Even though
twins look the same and share the
same genes, Juda believes that they

each have their ownminds and their

breed humans like we

are animals
then we are treading on “dangerous
ground.” ' C

Dr. Michael Gorin, the interiml

chair of the Dept. of Human
Genetics at the University of
Pittsburgh, believes that the whole
genetic issue has been blown out of
proportion.

As long as thexgene can be
removed without causing damage to

other genes, most groups feel the
process is justified.

The biggest argument that genet-
ic researchers today throw out as a
response to the religious concerns
about cloning and genetic research is
that God gave us the ability to figure
out how to do these things, so there-
fore it must be part of God’s plan.

Many religious groups, also
believe that God did give us the
intelligence to advance society and
to better ourselves-, but it is our
responsibility to know right from
wrong.

V Kuechenmeister is quick to say
that just because we have

the technology does not mean that
we should use it.

“God also gave us the minds, the
brains, and the ability to figure out
the nuclear weapons that we dropped
on Hiroshima,” states
Kuechenmeister. “I think we need to
closely examine the implications of
our actions.” ’

Check agrees, stating, “God has
given us knowledge as a gift to the
Earth and all that’s in it is a gift too.
The challenge is how we use that
gift.” \’

The overall theme of the class-

and celebration, consists of four
straw overhangs, symbolizing a roof,

The protest, which lasted approxi-
mately one hour, blocked the sidewalk
in front of» the restaurant, prompting
Pitt Spokesman, Ken Service to pass
out the University’s official statement
to Eat ‘n Park patrons. ‘

The statement, which outlined the
University’s position, argued that
Broadhurst‘ was aware of ERA’s
requests to speak out in support of
same—sex benefits and that she was
unable to do -so either in support or
protest due to Pitt’s «ongoing litigation
regarding the matter. Further, it reiter-
ated Pitt’s fear that Pennsylvania
would deny the University funding if
it violated the state’s law outlawing
homosexual marriages. '

Protestors marched with an array
of picket signs, ranging from “End

your silence, Suzy” to “Corporate

executives OWN Pitt,” while chanting
“Suzanne, come out —— you can’t hide,
silence means you comply!” and
“Won’t grant health care, Pitt is
unfair!”

In reference to the restaurant’s
popular dessert, many marchers held
giant cookie—face signs with frowns on
them. ’ . . ' _

Holly Lewis, senior chemistry and
history and philosophy of science
major and a member of ERA, stood off
of the curb on Murray Avenue,
attempting to explain the situation to
interested passersby and urging them
to sign the -group’s petition or even
take up a_ sign and join the rally. She

.wore a T-shirt with a picture of

Chairman of the Board of Trustees J.
W. Connolly, which read “Ask me if I
like girls” beneath it. Connolly
expressed in a deposition last fall his
discomfort with homosexual child
care givers and teachers. . '

.- Margie Downey had brought her
teen-age son and daughter to Eat . ‘n

Park for Sunday brunch. The three V

were surprised to see the protest when
they left the restaurant.

Downey’s son, who preferred to
remain anonymous, asked, “What the
hell does Eat "n Park have to do with
anything?” ~ - '

. Despite the large crowd, police
remained in. the background, and
WTAE was even able to conduct on-
air interviews with Service and mem-
.bers of the ERA. ‘ ‘

~ While Service gave his interview,
demonstrators chanted, “Ken Service
makes us nervous! While you lie, we
all die!” ‘ V

Service dismissed the comments
as an “occupational hazard,” and

’ seemedunfazed when Schnurer hissed
“Shame,” and “They needed lawyers _

at Nuremberg,‘ too” at him.

He continued later, by saying, “I
think Ken Service is a spokesperson
for evil” and equating Service’s

_ ‘defense of .the University with the

- defense of white supremacists.
Friedman questioned why the .

University‘ was not making efforts to
join forces with other public universi-
ties to lobby Harrisburg and
Washington to overturn the law, there-

by allowing Pitt to grant same—sex

benefits. . _ V
‘ Friedman also questioned why the
University refuses to release the exit
amount of money it has spent on same-
sex benefits-related litigation to date.
Service countered by saying that
the University’s efforts have been con-
centrated on “all the legal action,” pre-
cluding it from lobbying with students
at Penn State, for example, who have
recently held rallies in favor of same-

sex benefits. He said Pitt is under no _ “
obligation to release spending to the

public.
Service also noted that Broadhurst
was not invited to ‘speak at the event. "
Lewis conceded this, saying she
had put a ﬂyer on the trustee’s door,

‘notifying her of the rally.

‘ A ﬂyer is how Dr. Karen Peterson

of Pitt’s Graduate -School of Public

Health learned of the rally. _
“I feel that [denying benefits
based on state threats to discontinue

funding] is acting unnecessarily fright-

ened. The University is a big enough
employer -that  funding would not be
cut off.” ‘ ' ‘
Peterson, who was marching with
graduate student ‘Tammy Thomas, con-
tinued by saying, “It’s a problem, but I

_ think the University should take it as a

challenge.”

i Pitt has yet to contact other public
universities within Pennsylvania or to
make efforts to lobby at the state or

national level for laws supporting I

same—sex benefits.
‘For now, ERA and the Coalition

are planning such cooperative mea-

sures and state and national lobbying:
The groups also plan to hold similar
rallies for each trustee.

“It’s obvious we need to be talking »

to other universities,” Friedman said.
Lewis was happy with Sunday’s

turnout, and said she. was “pleased”

overall with the success of the rally.

In the country of the poor,

the multi-millionaire is king

It just goes to show money
can’t buy everything. An
“American businessman” propo-
sitioned Britney Spears, offering
her over $7 million for sex. She
declined, telling him that she
wanted to wait for marriage first.

"Most people will probably
not think better of Spears for her
choice. Spears is an indisputable
sexual icon in America, the sub-

ject of hundreds of pornographic

Web sites. Magazines exploit her
cuteness from every conceivable

camera angle, as do posters and

record companies. A pretty face
gets a lot of ﬂack these days, and
turning down this particular
businessman earns a neutral

_ public response. So she’s not a

whore, people will say. Big deal.
But what drives a man to
ﬂaunt money in such a superfi-

-cial way? Is our anonymous

tycoon so desperate that he can’t
find women? Or is this a twisted
interpretation _of the American
dream: Work hard, put your nose _
to the grindstene, until you can
make enough money to buy the

ﬂesh of beautiful women.

Legal technicalities aside -
this is basically a request for
prostitution — our antihero has

taken get—rich—quick schemes to

their logical conclusion. After

“Who Wants to Marry a Multi-
Millionaire?”, how far must one
leap to find “Who Wants to
Screw a Millionaire?” We can
quantify the body and its acts; to
one Don Juan, Britney Spears is
worth a little more than $7 mil-
lion. How much are the rest of us
worth?

Fortunately, Spears is rich
and famous already. With" one
record deal she could‘ substitute
a good sum of the rejected
money. If she feels traumatized,
she can turn the ordeal into a
song. ’

If the desperate suitor had
pursued, say, a welfare mother
with half adozen kids, the situa-
tion would be very different. All
it takesis one bankruptcy, a little
debt, or even a feeling of inade-
quacy to make the common
woman a target. Now that the
plot of “Indecent Proposal” can
be realized before the gaze of the
paparazzi, will this offer open
the ﬂoodgates? Will, any old
CEO feel powerful enough to
perceive city streets as a person-
al love-mart? $7 million is a

huge sum of money, enough to q

purchase almost any dream. If a
person has to think twice about
auctioning his or her body, has
the bidder already won?

Meditating on great Aurelius

It’s official: “Gladiator” is a hit.
Director Ridley Scott’s action-ﬁlled take on

‘_ ancient Rome stormed to a $34.8 million
jackpot on its opening weekend, and easily

passed the $100 rrrillion benchmark by its
third weekend in release. The ﬁlm’s success
has surprised nobody: The presence I of
charismatic leading ,man Russell Crowe,
combined with a wealth of eye-popping,
intense battle scenes, helped to generate big
pre—release buzz for the epic tale. ‘ ,

I had also been eagerly anticipating the
film, but for different reasons. You see,
“Gladiator” is one of those cinematic ven-
tures not unlike “Titanic” and
“Shakespeare in Love” —— which mixes his-
torical fact with fiction; ‘invented
characters trade dialogue with
actual historical figures in each
film.

And in “Gladiator,” the pro-
ducers have decided to breathe
new life into-one of my personal heroes:
Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher—warrior
who reigned as emperor of Rome in the sec-
ond century. In addition tobeing a skilled
military commander, Aurelius was also a
man of deep scholarly and ethical inclina-
tions; this latter characteristic poured forth
in a famous journal which he wrote while
defending the borders of the empire.
Known as “Meditations,” this volume has

come to be recognized as one of the great .

classics of Worldliterattrre. ’

I first read Maxwell Staniforth’s superb
translation of “Meditations” many years
ago, and the insights of Aurelius moved me
deeply. The ancient soldier’s personal phi-
losophy "drew heavily on the great tradition
of Greek Stoicism. His was a disciplined
but humane ethical standard; his was a pen-
etrating and comprehensive ‘vision of the
individual’s place within a universe of both
great suffering and great beauty.

So it was with both anticipation and
trepidation that‘ I went to see “Gladiator” on
its opening weekend. I was enormously
pleased with Richard-Harris’ performance

as the aged emperor. This was Aurelius
much as I imagined him to be: a man of
intelligence, strength, and quiet dignity.

- Although Aurelius was deeply engaged

» with humanity, the essence of his philoso-

phy put a ﬁrm stress on individual autono-
my and responsibility. In Book 3 of his
“Meditations,” the old soldier declares:
“We have to stand upright ourselves, not be
set 11p.” In our current era, where the cult of
whiny self—pity often seems to reign
supreme, perhaps we could all beneﬁt from
a touch of Aurelius’ Roman self-possession.

In the years since I first “met” Aurelius,
his penetrating words have often been a
source of inspiration to me. I’ll never forget
when, some time ago, I had to
complete a grueling three-
hour land navigation exercise
in order to pass an Army train-
ing course. Armed with a com-
pass and map, I trudged
through the unforgiving South Carolina for-
est, the July sun beating down mercilessly

- on me. A number of my classmates had

already been sent home in disgrace after
having failed other portions of the course,
so the pressure was on. What if I failed this
exercise?

As I contemplated my situation, I asked
myself, “What would Marcus have to say?”
And I remembered his words from Book 4:
“So here is a rule to remember in future,
when anything tempts you to feel bitter:
not, ‘This is a misforttme,’ but ‘To bear this
worthily is good fortune.”’ So I resolved,
pass or fail, to bear the consequences
“worthily.”

I passed the exercise with a perfect
score. And I thank Aurelius for the inspira-
tion he gave me that day, and for the inspi-
ration he continues to give me. Across the
gulf of centuries, I salute him as an honored
father, and I embrace him as a beloved
brother.

Michael Maaza encourages you to get in
touch with your inner Roman.

Are we progressin

Progress. One wonders how anyone
could be opposed to such 'a thing. It is a
term used by politicians, writers and busi-
nessmen to claim that they’re on the right
side of a situation. Why do we favor it so
much, though? Why is the future neces-
sarily better in any sense than the past?

Well, it may not be. As we “progress,”
we often truly regress. For instance,
American parents now spend 11 fewer
hours with their kids than they did in 1960.
Here we should be heading backwards
rather than continuing forward. If we have
more progress of this kind for a long time,
we’ll reach the point where parents and
children no longer see each other at all. Is
that a good thing? We should hope for
reduction in working hours and for

increased family hours. After all, isn’t rais-
ing kids more important than raising one’s
income? Yet neither of our major political

' parties dares oppose this trend, citing eco-

nomic progress as an excuse for waging a
war on families.

The cult of progress works on a very
silly notion — it assumes for— A

bia? Most people probably liked Ohiopyle
State Park more before the abundance of
stores sprang up around it.‘ As Andrew
Bard Schmookler points out, “A person
returning to the place of his or her child-
hood would probably not lament upon
discovering that ‘where there once was a
shopping center, there now stands a wood-
ed glen.”’ Yet it is the shopping center that
many people identify as progress.

This leads us to ask a fairly blunt
question: What exactly is progress?

I Progress is insider trading. Progress is”

pollution. Progress is nuclear missiles
replacing swords. Progress is two parents
having to work to support a family.
Progress is Bill Clinton occupying an
office once held by Jimmy Carter.
Progress is a mom and pop shop or a
Squirrel Hill bookstore being replaced by
a Wal—Mart or Barnes & Noble. Progress

is Britney Spears replacing the likes of .

Billy Joeland Stevie Wonder. Progress is
horrnone-affecting agents decreasing
human and animal fertility and endanger-
ing the future of the world. Progress is the

end of “Cheers” and the beginning of '
“E!”(the gossip channel) Progress is .
A another corporate welfare payment.

Progress is the wife—beating Wilfredo
Cordero manning the same position once

' - held by Wﬂhe Stargellgand Fred Clarke. .

Progress is people getting carpal tunnel

syndrome thanks to computers. Progress, _

in other words, is hype and disappoint-
ment.

Of course, many things have‘

improved with time and progress often is
good. We can cheer a lower crime rate.
Increasing interracial marriages are a pos-
itive sign. Warren Morris is an improve-

‘ ment over Jose Lind. Progress has a lot of

positives, and the past has its ﬂaws, which
nostalgia often ignores. But it is very siIn-
ple—minded and false to claim that the past

is inherently inferior to the future simply

because it is the past.

Glamour/Style/Fashion, an exhibition of Andy

The exhibition uses a wide variety of media

Houston, we don’t have a problem

Pitt baseball stars Joe Lydic and Jory coughen0llr drafted by the Astros

BRAD CUPRIK
Assistant Sports Editor

The Panthers were well represented at the
annual Major League Baseball First-Year Player
Draft on Monday. 3 T ’ .

Two Pitt players, third baseman Joe Lydic
and pitcher Jory Coughenour were taken by the
Houston Astros, a rival of the Pittsburgh Pirates
in the National League’s Central‘Division. _

Lydic was selected by the Astros in the sev—_'
enth round as the 217th player "overall. ’

He became theehighest Panther selected since

Chris Jelic was taken in the second round by the
Kansas City Royals in 1985. . ’ .
A While Lydic was unsuccessfully trying to get
the updated results on MLB’s Web site, Pitt
teammate and roommate Doug Caraway sent him
an instant message telling Lydic he was drafted
by Houston.

“I thought he was kidding, but I guess he
wasn’t,” Lydic said in a phone interview yester-
day. . .- .

 “I’m still pretty excited about getting draft-
' ed,” Lydic said.

The Astros’ scout will visit Lydic at his home
in Bethel Park, Pa., today to discuss possible
contract terms and work out the details of sign-
ing. » '

pass up opportunities.

Lydic has had a wonderful career
already here at Pitt, and I’m sure the
team will suffer some without him, but
everybody eventually has to leave col-
legiate baseball.

As far as Coughenour goes, he
_ doesn’t have any decisions to make.

ing it to the big leagues with the
Astros, because he’d- have to pitch in
Enron Field, where as I’ve said before,

Don’t worry, though.

It’s still only June, and as the NBA
and NHL playoffs come to a close, the
golﬁng and baseball seasons become
the main focus.

runs with 33 in the Big East tourna—’

ment, and still has one year left of
eligibility.

If Lydic decides to forego his
senior year and sign with the
Astros, he will probably start play-
ing in late June for the Auburn
Doubledays of the short-season
New York-Penn League.

However, if he decides to stay
for his last season, he can re—enter
the draft next June and be selected

again. » ,

The only thing holding Lydic
back from the jump to the pros is
the contract.

“If they don’t give me a good
offer, I’ll stay, but this is profes-

sional baseball, and I couldn’t see

myself turning an offer down,”
Lydic said. _

“Whether he chooses to sign a
professional contract or complete
his collegiate career, I wish him the
best,” Jordano said. “He truly
deserves it.”

Lydic was named to the All-Big
East Conference Second Team,
leading the team ,with 19 home
runs, 49 runs batted in, 57 runs
scored, 71 hits and a .684 slugging
percentage. . ‘

“It would’ve been nice to go to

the Pirates, but Houston decided to
take me, so that’s where I’ll‘ go,”
Lydic said.

He also commented on the pos-
sibility of playing in Enron Field,
the Astros’ new ballpark.

“With the short left field, it
would be great to play there,” Lydic
said.

Coughenour, the Panthers’ staff
ace last season, was taken with the
607th pick in the draft in the 20th
round by the Astros. '

He has struck out 154 batters in
his career and holds the all-time
innings pitched record at Pitt with
233.

“I’m very excited about it,”
Coughenour said. “The Astros’
scout calledme after they had draft-
ed me on Monday.”

The scout will visit with
Coughenour on Friday and discuss
his immediate future.

The Astros’ two rookie teams

are the Martinsville Astros in
Virginia of the Appalachian League
and the class A Auburn Doubledays
in New York of the New York-Penn

Those two leagues begin play

“This is a great honor for Jory,”

“Well, the weather was terrible
for the final race,” Lewis said. “But
they still did outstanding. They were
13th best coming into the NCAA’s,
and they finished fourth. It was just a

Pitt finished 18th overall, with

Louisiana State, the winning,
