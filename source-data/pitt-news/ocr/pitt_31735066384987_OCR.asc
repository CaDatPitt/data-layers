1 984 candida te’s son
lobbies for Dukakis

By Jessica Coville and
larrett Altdorfer
For The Pitt News

Last night, Ted Mondale, the
midwestern political director of
the Dukakis/Bentsen campaign
and son of former Vice President
Walter Mondale, spoke to a large
group of students at a Pitt College
Democrats—sponsored event.

Mondale discussed a plethora
of issues pertaining to the upcom-
ing presidential election in
November. In his dramatic open-

ly well received by the students
in attendance.

Mondale then approached the
issue of health care: ”We are the
only industrialized nation, other
than South Africa, that does not
have a universal health—care sys-
tem.” Thisiis a far—reaching con-
cern for Americans who are
worried about the ever-escalating
costs of medical treatment.

Mondale strongly defended
Dukakis’ view on foreign policy,
observing, ”We need a policy of
human rights.” This policy which
he mentioned included: building
on the Central American Peace
Plan, putting immense econom-
ic pressure on South Africa, and
respecting the sovereignty of in-
dividual nations.

Mondale said that we must buy

Burma unrest leaves estimated 100 dead

RANGOON, Burma (AP) —
Soldiers loyal to the new military
government opened fi re on thou-
sands of demonstrators who
surged into the streets Monday to
protest a military coup. About
100 people were reported killed
in Rangoon.

Demonstrations also broke out
in other cities, including Manda-
lay. Witnesses and other reports
said a total of about 150 people,
including 17 soldiers, had died in
the violence that swept Burma af-
ter Sunday’s coup.

The military placed the death
toll at 23 Monday but gave no
details.

Military commander Saw
Maung engineered the newest
change in power in Burma by
overthrowing civilian President
Maung Maung.

Thousands of kids
reported homeless

WASHINGTON (AP) -— At least
100,000 of America's children
are homeless on any given night,
and that doesn't include those

who have run away from home
or been kicked out by their par-
ents, the National Academy of
Sciences estimated Monday.

While male alcoholics and
former mental patients still make
up a large portion of the home-
less, the fastest-growing group of
people with no place to live is
children under 18, said the
Academy's Institute of Medicine.

The report said most homeless
children are in families headed
by the mother, and it found that
homeless mothers frequently
have no one to call upon, even
in severe emergencies.

Senate to approve
Canada trade bill

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
Senate neared approval Monday
of a landmark free-trade agree-
ment with Canada phasing out
tariffs on the $131 billion worth
of goods that cross the northern
US. border each year.

”This agreement is positive for
both nations, and it is a boost for
the world trading system,” Sen.
Daniel P. Moynihan, D—N.Y., told
the Senate, as it prepared to vote
to send the measure to President
Reagan"s desk.

It would open the door for a
10-year phaseout of U.S. tariffs

and various other trade curbs if
political problems on the Cana-
dian side are resolved.

There, the House of Commons
has passed a bill to start the tariff
phaseout, but majority Liberals in
the appointive Senate have bot-
tled it up until Prime Minister Bri-

an Mulroney calls new elections.

Mulroney is expected to call
elections within a few weeks.
Defeat for his Conservative Party
could doom the plan in the new
Parliament.

The free-trade zone established
under the agreement would differ
sharply from a common market.

Soccer team looking for
offense after splitting
first two games of ’88

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

The soccer team is 1-1 after
winning the season opener 3-1 at
Slippery Rock last Wednesday
and losing a close one to Buck-
nell 1-0 in overtime this past
Saturday.

Coach Joe Luxbacher was_hap-
py to start off the season with a
win and was pleased overall _with
the team's performance against
Slippery Rock.

”We played well and did some
good things offensively,” Lux-
bacher said. ”We had a shaky
second half and made some mis-
takes that we can't afford to make
as we go through the season, or
they're going to catch up to us."
‘ Midfielders Heinz Pak and
Mark'Mostinckx were able to
contribute to the patience of the
offensive line as the Panthers
passed and controlled the ball ef-
fectively.

However, the team ex-
perienced some problems finish-
ing on goal. As Pak said, the
offensive line had a tendency to
become overanxious around the
opponent's 18-yard line.

”We had a lot of shots on goal,
but we were mis—hitting the ball
from too far out," Pak said.

Mostinckx sees improvement
in the offensive line but is not
satisfied with its overall per-
formance.

”We don't finish up front
enough. We create the chances,
but once we get inside the 18,
that's where everything goes
wrong. We're missing the final
touch, that final pass,” he said.

. Slippery Rock scored inside the

‘ first five minutes of the first half.

Senior goalie Mark Hendricks,

who recordedtnine shutouts his

sophomore year, was satisfied
with his teammates in front of
him but disappointed with
himself.

’’I'm not really happy. I think

I could have played better. I felt -

a little off, just not 100 percent,”
he said.

Hendricks was benched about
a third of the way through last
season due to a lack of competi-
tive spirit and difficulty keeping
in shape during the off-season.
Luxbacher benched him because,

according to Hendricks, ”he
thought the best way to get me
out of it was to let me watch what
was going on from the bench.”

Hendricks and Jay Kapusta
then split time in goal toward the
end of last season.

The transition of going from a
sophomore phenomenon with
nine shutouts to a benched junior
with an attitude problem is still
clear in Hendricks’ mind, which
accounts for his personal disap-
pointment concerning the Slip-
pery Rock game.

He seems to be judging his
play by always thinking about
what he could have done more
effectively, and that is a good
sign.

Two of the Panthers’ goals
were scored by defenders. Stop-
per John Ascher scored on a corn-
er kick, and fullback John Osberg
scored on his head ball. The only
goal scored by an offensive play-

er was a shot by midfielder Scott ‘

Armstrong.

This past Saturday, the Panthers
lost a hard-fought defensive con-
test at Bucknell, which has domi-
nated Pitt for years, boasting an
18-6-0 lifetime record against the
Panthers.

The lone goal was scored by
Bucknel|’s All-American striker
Dave Domshon, who scored in-
side the Pitt 18-yard line while
being double teamed by Ascher
and sweeper Dan Liberati.

Most of the game was simply
organized passing up and down
the field on the part of both

teams. However, the Panthers ex-_

perienced a 10-minute offensive
drought during the first half when
they were stuffed back into their
own end with Buckne|l’s cons-
tant offensive pressure. The
defense did its job. It seems to be
the offensive line that needs some
work.

Pitt does not have a single,
major scoring threat like Dom-
shon, who is capable of constant-
ly pressuring the opposing
defense. The line controls the ball

and moves it up the field well but

breaks down around the oppo-
nent's 18.

Mostinckx said: ’’It seems that
we're afraid to take people on
one-on-one. Somebody has the

season. They were able to beat
the New York Yankees three out
of four games this past weekend
to stretch their lead to six games
over the Detroit Tigers and Mil-
waukee Brewers.

But, then again, this is the Red
Sox we're talking about. Don't
get your hopes up too high.

0 In the Who Can Believe It
Category: The Cincinnati Bengals
are 3-0. Yes, this is the same team
coached by Sam Wyche. The
same team that threw away a
number of games last season with
bonehead plays. Maybe there is

parity in the NFL. No, wait — it's
probably just luck.

0 The Atlanta Falcons beat the
San Francisco 49ers 34-17 on
Sunday. This game means more
than anyone might think. if the
NFC West race is anything like
last season, the 49ers are going
to have to beat weaker teams
such as the Falcons. The Los An-
geles Rams are now in first place
with a 3-0 record. The 49ers and
Saints are in second. it could go
down to the wire.

0 Well, maybe the Miami Dol-
phins aren't just dead fish on a
football field. On Sunday, the
Green Bay Packers’ defense fell
victim to the Dolphin offense in
a 17-14 loss.

   

VINDE
CAREY

Quarterback Dan Marino
threw for 261 yards and two
touchdowns, his first two of the

season. This is the real Miami
team that everyone has seen the
past two seasons.

0 Last Saturday, Pitt Stadium
looked like Ohio Stadium. The
sea of red around the stands
could have made it more like a
home game for the Buckeyes.
Maybe Pitt fans should take a
clue from Clemson fans. During
their game against Florida State,
the stadium looked like a giant
orange. That is sure to freak out
a visiting team.

In this game, FSU coach Bob-
by Bowden proved once again
that he may very well be the most
imaginative coach in college
football. He called a fake punt
with less than a minute left, deep

in Clemson territory, and the
game tied. The play worked per-
fectly, and the ball ended up 74
yards down the field. FSU then
went on to kick the winning field
goal in a 24-21 win. Way to go,
Bobby.

0 The game this Saturday be-
tween Pitt and West Virginia
should be a highly explosive con-
test. The quarterbacks (Pitt's Dar-
nell Dickerson and WVU's Major
Harris) are two exciting players.
Harris runs the option better than
Don McPherson ran it at Syracuse
last season and should provide
plenty of trouble for the Pitt
defense.

Dickerson doesn't have as

much experience running the op-
tion as Harris does, but he is
stronger and quicker. It should be
a good game and could have a
direct impact on this year's race
for the National Title, or at least
Beast of the East consideration.

0 Arnold Palmer finally won a
PCA Seniors tournament, his first
since 1985. Palmer shot a two-
under—par 70 on the final round
and finished with a I3—under
203.

Maybe this is the return of ”Ar—
nie’s Army.” Nah, I guess not.

0 Well, the Summer Olympics
have started. And, of course,
there is some controversy.

First of all, Olympic boxer An-
thony Hembrick failed to show
up 10 minutes before his sched-
uled match. Therefore, he has
been disqualified. The U.S team
is up in arms.

First they said that his coaches
were given a faulty schedule,
then officials said the bus sched-
uled to pick him up was full and
he couldn’t get on. Now there is
a rumor that the whole team will
drop out. Remind anyone of '72?

If it were me, I'd make sure that
I were at the arena at least an
hour before the match. That way,
if there was any mix-up, at least
I would be covered. Hembrick
has been justly disqualified, and

Record holders get run

SEOUL, South Korea —— They
lined up at the Olympic pool
starting line for the men's
200—meter freestyle like eight
greyhounds, waiting for the
rabbit.

In lane three was Michael
Cross of West Germany, owner
of the world and Olympic
records and seven of the top 10
times ever recorded for the event.
He is big and blond, with an arm-
span the envy of any swimmer.

In lane five was Matt Biondi of
the United States, Gross’ main
challenger in the event and
equipped with the fastest time in
the world for 100 meters, halfthe
distance of this race.

Sandwiched between them in
lane four was Artur Wojdat of
Poland, world record holder at
400 meters, twice the distance of
this race, and the fastest qualifier
with a heat time of 1:48.02.

There they were, three world
record holders, lined up side by

THE PITT ‘NEWS, Tuesday, September 20, l988

-’_’_New”Bengals leap to top of AFC Central

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Pardon me boy, are they the
Cincinnati Bengals?

Yeah, yeah.

Boomer and Wyche, oh they're
sure looking nice.

Okay, maybe the undefeated
Bengals didn't take the Chat-
tanooga Choo-Choo to the top of
the AFC Central, but they've got-
ten there somehow.

And the rest of the league, well,
it's safe to say that it's standing

around in disbelief, especially af-
ter Cincinnati's abysmal 4-11

record of one year ago.

J

The Bengals lost six of those
games by a grand total of 17
points, many with little time on
the clock. .

But Sunday's 17-12 upset over
the Pittsburgh Steelers is the
team's third straight victory, fol-
lowing wins over Phoenix
(21-14) and Philadelphia (28-24).

The last time the Bengals start-
ed a season 3-0 was 1975, when
the team finished the season 11-3
and earned a wild-card playoff
berth.

Quarterback Boomer Esiason
and a surprisinglystingy defense
have led to Cincinnati's
resurgence.

3 Delta DeltaDelta
: proudly announces §

"The coaches have told us just
to play our game, to play what
we've been coached, and things
should go our way,” said Esiason.
"We've been playing confident-
ly, especially in the last three
minutes of the ball game. We've
just risen to a higher level and
come up with the big play when
we needed it."

So far in 1988, the Bengals
have outscored opponents 28-10
in the fourth quarter.

So what's the biggest difference
between last year's squad and
this year's?

”Again, it's a question of mak-
ing big plays,” said Esiason.
”We’re virtually the same team as
the one that was picked to go to
the Super Bowl last year. This
team is loaded with good people.

”We're looking at last year as
an aberration, trying to keep it in
perspective, just like we're trying
to keep this year in perspective.”

Members of the Steelers, a
team that Cincinnati lost to twice
in 1987, can sense a change also.

"You can see they are playing
with confidence this year,” said
Pittsburgh nose tackle Gerald
Williams. ”The biggest difference
is among the veterans. Boomer,
he's always played well, but the
people around him are more con-
fident now.”

How have the Bengals made it
all look so easy after making it
look so hard last season?

”lt’s not easy. We've put in a
lot of hard work,” says Esiason.
”But now that we're winning, it's
a lot easier to go out and walk
around Cincinnati."

ball 5 yards out of the box, and
instead of taking his man on and
trying to score or at least driving
to the goal and trying to get a
penalty out of it, we cross the ball
or take a longshot.

”Those balls that far out [18-25
yards] are 50/50. Anyone can get
to them. We'll never score play-
ing like that.

”We had plenty of opportuni-
ties as we approached the 18, but
we just never worked the ball
in,” Mostinckx said.

Sophomore halfback Ivan
Amayo stated simply, ”We’ve got
to start putting the ball in the
net.”

Ascher, who is responsible for
stopping any team's leading
scorer, and Liberati, last man be-
fore the goalie, are certainly do-
ing their jobs. One of the best
strikers in the nation only scored

once, and that was in overtime.
Bucknell’s Domshon is an ex-

ample of what the Panthers’ en- -

tire offensive line needs to do.

Mostinckx said, ’’If Domshon
doesn't have the ball, he weaves
through the defense and sets
things up. When he does have
the ball around the 18, he holds
it or passes laterally or plays it
back. You create a lot of oppor-
tunities playing like that, not by
taking long shots or crossing like
we do.”

Perhaps watching Domshon
operate was a valuable lesson for
Pitt. The offense must get itself
together inside the 18, because
you don't win a lot of soccer
games by having defenders score
goals.

The home opener is tomorrow
night at 7:15 p.m. against West
Virginia University at Pitt
Stadium.

race routine, none even glancing
at the other. It seemed as if they
were preparing to swim a prac-
tice heat in some pool at home,
instead of for an Olympic gold
medal.

Now they climbed the blue

starting pedestals, their bodies «

tensed, poised, bent, waiting for
the signal to go.

All at once, Gross pulled the
trigger prematurely and was in
the water. Was the false start
premeditated to increase the pres-
sure on the competition?
Perhaps. Biondi and Wojdat just
backed away, though, thinking
whatever a swimmer thinks in
that circumstance, before return-
ing to prepare again for the start.

This time they went off
together, hitting the water almost
in unison, the yellow, blue and
red lane-divide markers shaking

at the impact. The crowd roared
as the race began, and attention
was riveted to those three middle
lanes where Gross, Wojdak and
Biondi were engaged in their
own little private drama.

Cross was at 25.65 and Woj-
dat one-hundredth of a second
slower than that. But they weren't
running 2-3 behind Biondi. Other
swimmers were surfacing and for
the first time, this became more
than a three-man race.

Over in lane two American
Troy Dalbey, celebrating his 20th
birthday, was in at 25.56, and
next to him in lane six, right next
to Biondi, was Duncan Arm-
strong of Australia at 25.46.

Now for the third leg, and still
Biondi persisted, leading the
others now as his body worked
almost as if it were computerized,
each arm pulling him through the
water. His time was 1:19.62, and

now there were just 50 meters to
go, one last lap in the crystal-clear
blue waters of the Olympic Park
pool.

Biondi made his turn and head-
ed for home. ’’I knew this would
be the most competitive race of
the Olympics,” he said later. ’’I
wanted to swim my race, be

~ ahead at 150 and get home as

well as I could.”

They came roaring through the
last lap together, eight swimmers
separated by precious little time
and space. And when they hit the
finish mark, Matt Biondi had an
Olympic medal.

Not gold. That went to Arm-
strong. Not silver. That belonged
to Holmertz. ’

The bronze put to rest any
chance that Biondi would put on
a Mark Spitzian gold medal
sweep at these Games.
