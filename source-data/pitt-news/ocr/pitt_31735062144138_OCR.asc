Made Head
Of Vet Revue

Leonard Fried, formerly asso-
ciated with “This Is The Army”
has been appointed student direct-
or of George Vet’s Scandals, the
veteran’s revue planned for pre-
sentation during Spring Festival
week. Fried, who’ worked with
the special service force-s at Camp
Upton, N. J., where “This Is The
Army” was originally produced,
brings a wealth of actual produc-
tion experience to his new post.

While on the staff of “This. Is
The Army,” Fried worked with
many footlight notables -including
Irving Berlin,‘ Ezra Stone, and
others. During the world-wide
tourof the show, members of the
staff underwent ‘a -gamut of ex-
periences which included every-
thing from cold, dam-p, foggy days
in the ETO to subm-arine-dodging
in the waters of the South Pa-
ciﬁc. »

Asked to comment on his pres-
ent plans, Director‘ Fried said,
“Right now, I’m’interested in lin-«
ing up all the talent available so
that we can work from there.”
He‘ also added that any-one who
may be capable of qualifying and
has not yet applied at the Vet’_s
office of the eighth floor, may still
come up this week and ﬁil out an
application. According to all the‘
advance reports heard up to now,
George Vet’s Scandels ’ should
prove to be -one of the feature at-
tractions of Sp ~ing,Festival week.

First Pitt Players Production,».
Jim Dandy, Opetns Thursday

“Jim Dandy” is coming to Pitt
within the next few days to make
acquaintances“ with members of
the faculty, and s'tuden:t body. He
has an interesting philosophy of
life. -He believes that he is above
everyone else, and that no other
person is greater than another.

As a representative of theideas
of William -Saroyan, Jim Dandyis
-a character of fantasy, a dreamer,
and an idealist. His theories of his
dramatic life will be portrayed
Thursday, April 11, and Friday,
April 12, by the Pitt Players.

Since the tickets have been sell-
ing so rapidly for both permorm-
ances, it looks as if the production
will play to a full-capacity house.
The ground floor booth is the

Steinberg, in the title role. with
Anne Monteverde, Charles 1Miller,
Ivan Birsic, Norman Grove, An-
gela Guiallamb-ardo, Albert Am-
shell, Tom Dempsey, and Rich-
ard Grove.’

Representing the specialists on
the techincal staﬁvwill be: Sandy
Eisenstat, lighting director; Betty
Ryckman, make-up director; Bob
Grape, technical director and set
designer; and Penn Burke, cos-
tume mistress.

The structure of the fantasy is
the compositional design of the
ballet combined with spok en
drama. The only type of theater
which approaches the production
form of “Jim Dandy” is the ballet.
William Saroyan has surpassed

headquarters for the ticket sales.

"l"l~.e prizro of the 'l.ic-kelzs are 75:

cents each.
The all-star cast includes Mel

any other writers in the develop-
lment of such a structural frmt:1.<_v

"rPitt dance.

Tickets costing $3.00 per couple
will be on sale in the ground floor
booth in the Cathedral of Learning
through Friday. Tickets at the
door will cost $3.50 Der couple.

George W bitten, chairman of the
affair, said that many Pitt students
feel the dance is restricted to stu-
dents in the School of Engineering
and Mines. “This is in no way
the case. The Bunny Hop ‘is
merely sponsored by the Engineer-
ing and Mines students. Everyone
in Pitt, whatever his school or de-
partment, is invited and encour-
aged to come out next Saturday
night for a good time,” he said.

The ruling. of the University’s
social committee which forbids
corsaiges at all Pitt‘ affairs will be
enforced. All corsages will be
taken from the wearers at the
door.

The question, “Why not go to
the Bunny Hop?” was raised by
Roy Reinhard, .-business manager
of the dance. “Going to the Bun-
ny Hop is the only practical thing
to ‘do on Saturday‘ night,” he said.
"First of all, we assure you that

[.‘>’0u’ll have a good time in your

own college crowd. In the second
place, where else can two people
spend a Saturday night anything
like the one we offer for only
$3.00? Remember, fellows, the
name of it is the Bunny Hop——and
no Corsages.”

Chaperons for the dance will.
be Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bromilow
and Mr. and Mrs. Alfred C. Acken—
heil. Mr. Ackenheil is an in-
structor in ‘civil engineering, while
Mr. Bromilow is an assistant pro-
fessor of civil engineering.

An Easter theme has been se-
lected<for the decorations of the
dance. The Urban room will be
decorated with bunny silhouettes,
tulips, and balloons in spring col-
ors. Crepe paper streamers of
yellow, lilac, pink, white, and pale
green will complete the decora-
tions. Silver band bracelets with
a bunny stamped on them will be
given as favors to the gi1'|..~: :iltcn«_l-
mg the (lance. l”)ecol';—iti-.»i";.< and
favors were aimmged by Hilda-

garde Wrabley.

Parkingflssue
Faces Students

As a result of the parking prob-
lem created by the large increase
in enrollment this semester, Pitt
students daily are violating p-ark-
ing regulations, thereby subject-
ing themselves to ﬁnes.

Practically every day some Pitt
students get parking tickets for
parking at the curb in front of
the entrances to the Cathedral of
Learning. This practice _is in vio-
lation of a state ordinance forbid-
ding blocking of entrances to pub-
lic buildings.

On Bigelow boulevard the sit-
uation is somewhat confusing in

that the curb is painted yellow‘
from Fifth avenue to Forbes street, ‘

suggesting that parking is prohib-
itéd all along Bigelow boulevard.
That yellow line was put-there
when the street was used as a
drill ﬁeld for the soldiers. As yet.
the city has not removed the line.

;Steps are -being taken by the
oﬁice of the dean of men to clarify
parking regulations.

In addition, many students are
usi-ng the drive way to the Schen-
ley hotel for parking. Some stu-
dents have even parked their cars
in such a manner‘ as to block the
drive way, risking a tow to the
city garage. That area is for the
use of hotel patrons only.

Some students do not realize
that lih“l't" is orlv :1 two ilillll‘ time

Insigniﬁcant as it appeared in last Su11da..y’s issue of the
Piittsburgli Press, President ’l‘ruman’s statcnicnt that ‘young

men and women aged 18 should have the privilege of voting in ’

the nationalclcctions is of major importance to all Pitt stu-
dents. This declaration was made before an assembly of the
students of St. Rita’s hi.gh school in Chicago. He based his
statement on the grounds that if 18 year olds could accept the
responsibility of military service, they certainly should be capa-
ble of selecting their country’s leaders. This is not by any
means a new argument and we can -do something about it. -One
way of proving tothosc opposing the President's way of think-
ing is by continued dc1non.s7tration of our ability to select lead-
crs according totheir qualities. VVc, the students of the Uni-
versity, "can*'establish a reputation of being competent in se-
lecting our own leaders with careful considerations. Therefore,
it is absolutely necessary for all Pitt women to share in the

election of student leaders in today’s General Womcn’s Elec-

tions.

(A great many women have asked the question; what do
the nominating committees consider in selecting women for of-
fice? (In the cstimattion of the degree of Pitt women, these
standards are kept at the highest possible level. All nominees
are considered on the basis of their cooperation within the or-
ganization, the possession of the highest degree of ability to get
along with people, the greatest promise of leadership for the
University ideal, and a scholastic. point above average. Any
girl possessing all these qualities is considered worthy for nomi-
nation. » ’ ’

Senior court, the _\V-omen’s Self Government association,
a.nd'the nominating committees of all the women’s organizations
have worked long and hard these past tthrce weeks at the task of
carrying out the three-fold purpose of this election. This-year
the" reasons for the process of nominating committees, clearing
house and general elections are clearly stated as: 1) to protect
the individual, every woman is given a chance to choose the
nomination that she prefers to accept and she would be most
happy to win; 2) to protect the organization, no group needs
to feel that it has been made to accept the leftovers and every
group can have the assurance that it has ofﬁcers who are ha"ppy
and proud to work for the organization; 3) to protect the stu-
dent body, it gives the assurance of an orderly election and it
allows many more students to participate in activities. This is,
then, the essence of any state of democracy. ' g

The worst feature of most elections is that the individual
is not allowed to make up his own mind without the interference
of some sort of party politics. It is not a fair attitude for the
student body to be influenced in any way by a small minority
group who have the intentions or swaying the elections for the
people they are backing. For this very reason Senior court has
set“ the dates for clearing house and elections as close as pos-
sible. They hope to eliminate all types of group politics and
have each woman vote to the best of her knowledge, without
being biased. %

Today’s clcction presents the opportunity to decide who
should lead the student body and it is up to us to inaké the
proper sclcction. By so doing, we are training ourselves in
bcin g capable voters for ‘greater responsibilities. ,1

Student Congress! “It sounds
very important”, somebody re-
niarked in the Blue Tuck shop
the,‘ other day. Maybe the reason
it sounds important is because it
is‘, because it is one of the biggest»
things in student life on this cam-
pus. “The purpose of Student Con-
griess”, said Anita Colonna. vice
pdesident, “is to coordinate men’s
arid women’s activities on campus.
Itiexists to serve the student body
arid in so doing to serve the Uni-
vqrsity”. As I-lerky Knell, presi-
ddnt, said, “This organization be-
longs to the students—-it is their
mbuthpiece.”

Since it belongs to us, maybe
soineone would like to know what
gdes on in this Student‘ C-ongress.
D ring its meetings Student Con-
gress is confronted with all kinds
ofistudent problems which are dis-
cussed there and thrashed out.
(Anything that matters to the stu-
dent body matters also ‘Student
Congress. Questions like having
formal dances in the Common’s
Room, getting better food in the
Tuck shops, or having Athletic
ba‘nq‘uets were all discussed by‘ its
members. At one time it had con-
trbl of the university tea dances.
But the objection on the part of a
student to Student Congress con-
trolling all tea dances resulted in
an alteration of the policy. ‘Since
thffen, Student Congress decided to
accept petitions from campus or-
ganizations to sponsor their sched-
u led. afternoon tea dance. We want
tlie student body to know that
Student Congress works for them,”
Herky said.

It is one of the functions of Stu-
dent. Congress to choose all chair-
men and business managers for
soicial events. This is the work. of

t h e appointments committee
(chairman is Anita Colonna),
owl) ich chooses those applicants

who appear to be mostcompetent
when interviewed by the commit-
tee. .
fBecause many students couldn’t
gét the text books they needed,
Student Congress recently initial-
ed a book drive which was an ap-
peal to upper class men to lend
bcioks to Student Congress, books
which would be place in the Re-
.-:e?_1-ve book room for student use.
“We could have used a «little more
student support on this. It didn't
go over so well,” Anita Colonna
said. _ _
The biggest project Student
Congress is planning is
“ground floor to clean up project’}’.
A. new bulletin board with glass
partitions for each advertising or-
ganization has been suggested. A
ticket booth has been proposed “to
eliminate some of the conflict that
arises over‘ the use of the booth
on the‘ ground floor when"seve-ral
organizations need it at the same
tinie.” Some of the congestion’ of
the halls “under the clock” could
be relieved, they believed, by re-
moving the telephone booths and
putting them somewhere else. The
plan involves more locker space
and bulletin space all over the
University to let the student body
know‘ what's going on on cam-
-pus. Y

THE PITT NEWS

Dr. Dennis
Heads Service

To Aid Students

By Jules Kann

‘Perhaps you have sometimes
wondered -what kind of people
have automobile accidents. Per-
haps you would like to learn
something about the life of the
Hopi Indians. Maybe anthropology
would suit your taste better. Or
how about such esoteria as “The
propioceptive ability of the white
rat”? , .

The man who can tell you about
all of these and about plenty
more is Dr. Wayne Dennis, newly
appointed head of the department
of psychology. Dr. Dnnis, former
-head of the department of psy-
chology at Louisiana. State ‘Col-
lege, came to Pitt directly from
the navy, where as a lieutenant,
he served as the head of the “Hu-
man Engineering Section-Special
Devices Division.”

Dr. Dennis, accompanied by his
wife‘ and older daughter, spent
several summers with the Hopi
Indians in northern Arizona. He

studied the Hopi customs as re-
lated to the development of walk-
ing, and proved that physical ma-
turation, rather than learning is
the important factor in that de-
velopment. “The Hopi Child,” a
200 page -book, is the result of
these studies.

In another study, Dr. Dennis
found that people who are in-
volved in traffic accidents tend to
be socially irresponsible. Their
credit is ‘bad and these people
seem to take no part in civic af-
fairs. Also they are mostly under
twenty—ﬁve. (It is unknown to this
reporter whether Dr. Dennis was
ever involved in a traﬂic vi-ola-
tion himself).

School of Dentistry

Dr. J. Cliiford Eselman. assist-
ant professor of radiography in the
School of Dentistry, will conduct a
post-graduate course in radio-
graphy for dentists from June 17
to 21 inclusive. The course will be
given in the department of radio-
graphy of the School of Dentistry.

Attention members! Student
Congress publicity committee
meets this Friday afternoon
(April 12) at 2 o’clock in the
Pitt News oﬂice. Please be
prompt. ‘

Jim Pettican, chairman.

Dr. Wayne Dennis

Dr. Dennis, who became a mem-
ber -of Phi Beta Kappa during his
undergraduate studies, is the au-
thor oi sexictal books and over 60
journal articles. He was chairman
of the psychology section, Vir-
ginia Academy of Scien-ce, and
now holds oﬂices in various scien-
tiﬁc organizations.

At present, Dr. Dennis is work-
i.ng -on a plan to offer more serv-
ices to the students of Pitt. After
-having r-emodeled the offices of
the departm-ent, the new head in-
tends to offer the students the vo-
cational and psychological help,
which will give them a greater op-
portunity in life and make them
more desirable persons.

A recently organized service un-
der this is the vocational, educa-
tional, and -personal guidance of
interested University students.
Both counseling and testing serv-
ices are offered on a cost basis to
a limit-ed number of non-UniVer-
sity students.

The new division includes the
psychological clinic which assist
parents in -a better understanding
of their children, as well as the
University's Veteran Administra-
tion Guidance Center which has
already given vocational guidance
to more than 1500 veterans.

Dr. Dennis has announced Dr.
lWi»lliam A. Grove as director of
the new division. And as assist-
ants four men have -been added.
They are: Dr. Victor G. Raimy,
Dr. Roger W. Russell, John Valen-
tine, and Ralph E. Jenson.

Delta Delta Lambda

Delta Delta Lambda, honorary
commercial education fraternity,
will entertain students in commer-
cial education at an informal par-
ty tomorrow night. The party will
take place at 8:00 o’clock at the

Chi Omega house, 137 North Belle-

  Vets Sponsor

Tea Dance

The- Veterans association will
sponsor a tea dance in the,ball-
room of the Hotel Schenley next
Wednesday afternoon. April 17,
from 3 until 6 o’clock. Admission
price of this affair, the third after-
noon tea dance of the semester,
will be 35 cents.

George Carson, dance commit-
tee chairman, stressed the fact that
although this dance is sponsored
by the Veterans association, it is
in no sense restricted to members
of the association or even to for-
mer servicemen and w-omen.

“Every Pm: man or woman who
has 3:5 cents is invited to come to
this ‘deal.’ I think it’s a ﬁne chance
for the students to get together
and have fun,” he said.

Because of the size of the ball-
room, only -a limited number of
tickets can be sold. “This is no
dodge to sell tickets,” said John
Wohleber, ticket chairman. “It’s
the truth that only a certain num-
ber of -p-eople c.an get into -the
Schenley. Since. we aretrying to
provide an opportunity for Pitt
students to have a good time rath-
er than to make money, we don’t
see any point in overcrowding the
place.”

Psi Omega Honors

Dr. W. Swanson

The Duquesne Alumni chapter
and Nu chapters of Psi Omega, na-
_ti-onal dental fraternity, gave a
testimonial dinner in the Univer-
sity club on April 3 in honor of Dr.
William F. Swanson. Dr. Swanson
recently retired from the post of
Deputy Counselor of Nu Chapter
of Psi Omega, which he has had
for 22 years.

Dr. Swanson received a chest of
silver in appreciation of his many
years of service to Psi Omega. He
was also presented a wrist-watch
by the members of the Odontolog-
ical Society of Western Pennsyl-
vania in appreciation of his service
as editor of the Bulletin of that
society.

Dr. John F. McParland, instruc-
tor in clinical pathology in the
School of Dentistry, succeeds Dr.
Swanson as Deputy Counselor of
Nu chapter.

Carlson Calls Floor Practice

Monday In Stadium

‘By George J. P. Kiseda.

. If silver linings and silver anniversaries go hand-in-hand, Dr. H.
C. Carlson stands to get a glimpse of both Monday when he starts

spring practice as a prelude to his
ball coach.

« ‘ ' 4»
Any dreams the win-’em-all

philosopher is entertaining of a
second unbeaten season will hinge
largely on what is uncovered in
the forthcoming two-week session.
For, although the spring practice is
primarily for newly—enrolled vets,
it will measure fairly well Pitt’s
outlook for the 1946-7 campaign.

Most of the 1945-6 performers
will be on hand. The Panthers
lost only Hank Zeller,-four-year
vet, from the squad which split
even in 14 tussles. Of course, sev-
eral others may be removed from
the scene via the induction route.

Among the returnees will be
Nate Apple, “midget” co-captain
the past year. Packing three years
of college experience, Apple looms
as the top playmaker for next sea-
son.

Another asset should be Roger
J orgensen, towering pivot, who put
in one year at Ohio State before
entering the service. To Jorgen-
sen may fall the scoring burden
borne by Zeller during the past
campaign.

All drills will be held on the
Pitt Pavilion, unless weather per-
mits outside work. Four one-hour
sessions will be conducted during
the week, lasting from 4 to 5 p. m.
on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
and Friday. Candidates will be

Diamond Mel: Fight
For Starting Rolls

The Panthers will officially open
their baseball season April 22 at
Sal-em, Ohio. As yet Coach Mitter-
ling is still a little in doubt over
his starting line-up, but there are
good indications of the candidates
in line for first-string jobs.

A run—down of the c-lub with
the candidates for each position
woul-d show:

Catchers: Gene Yanchus, a g-ood
hitter and probable starter, with
Schwein-braten, the Gilotti broth-
e.:.‘:-;. and Slpinelli offering tough
-<:o.rnpe'tition.

Pitchers: A capable staff head-
ed ‘by righthanders Buck Johnson,
Tex Richards, Sam David, and
southpaw Jim Kline, with C-alder
and Gulish also ﬁghting for start-
ing assignments.

First Basemen: Clyde Marsiglio,
only hold-over from last sea-son’s
squad, -seems to be in line for the
job, but he’s getting s-ome stiff
competition from Kopetis and Cos-
tanza. .

Second ibasemenz Art Barnes

has the edge at the moment, with
Agerter and McWilliams also
ﬁghting for the keystone job.

‘Third bas-emen: Kuzio, D-ough-
erty, and Wilson are «battling it
out for the hot corner position,
with Kuzio appearing to be the
one to beat.

Shortstops: Johnny Wasiecko, a
good hitter and ﬁelder, may ﬁgure
heavily in Mitt-erling’s plans_ at
the short ﬁeld position. Olshelfski
and Manerino are others out for
the job. 2- '

Left ﬁelders: John Smodic, a
footballer, has the edge, with Zi-
olkowski and Rostocky still com-
peting. '

Center ﬁeld-ers: John Connelly
may cover the ‘center garden this
spring, but he’s being pressed by
O’R~ourke and Eilderton.

Right ﬁelders: -At the moment
the position is open. Sammy David
may start when he isn’t on the
mound, and Johns is also out for
the right ﬁeld job.

The following; is a letter Dr. Carlson received from Everett Morris,
New York Herald Tribune basketball editor:— '

Dear Doe:

I wish that you could have re-
mained in New York and seen the
East-West game because I am sure
that you not only wonlzl have on-
joyed it as a spectacle, but you
would have had a deep personal
interest in your ‘entry, Hank Zel-
ler. l -

What a job he did for usl'He was
magniﬁcent under pressure, drop-
ped into Joe Lapchick’s patterns as
though he had been there all his
life and was one of the game's
standouts.

To be honest about it, Joe was
a little afraid of Hank after
watching him in praetice—afraid
that his lack of condition and tim-
ing would make him a bad bet.
But came game time and Joe start-
ed him, probably with his ﬁngers
crossed. Then Hank proceeded to

go to town. Ofiensively he handled ,

the post like an old fence build-
er, h shot sharply and fed the ball
off very well. On defense he did

all anyone eight inches shorter
than his adversary could do and
then some. The way he kept the
West’s big goons out from under
would make an excellent lesson for
those who would like to accom-
plish this etlect by means of arcs.
lines, triangles, etc.

In a word, Doc, we liked Hank
very much; not only as a fine
clutch players, but as a. person. He
was :1. credit to himself, to you and
to Pittsburgh. Any time you have
any more lads like him, I can as-
sure you that they will be welcome
on any East-West squad that I
have anything to do with. Inci-
dentally you might be interested to
know that as a result of the game,
a. thousand poor kids are going to
have summer camp vacations this
summer as guests of the Tribune
Fresh Air Fund.

So long and all the best of
luck.
Sincerely,
Ev Morris

Pitt is the first on the list to receive the movie of this East-West
game which. is now in the stage of development.

Baseball Team Remains?

If a large turnout for a sport means a good season, Ralph Mitter-
ling and his assistant Ike Icardi should do right well for themselves

but you just don't win games that

way.

Pitt hasn’t done very well for itself on the diamond these past

four years, winning one game that came last season.
things this year the picture isn’t encouraging.

The pitching is the best

we have had in years but the inﬁeld is weak at ﬁrst and third and the
outfield remains a big question mark.

Notlzirzg Stops

By Lowell Lubic

The Blue  

and Gold

After four weeks of intensive practice, a ragged Pitt squad is slowly shaping into a presentable ball
club. Not even the unpredictable Fittsburgh weather can prevent these boys from practicing.

Scrimmaging is now a main event on the agenda. During this activity the coaches get a fairly good
idea of who is who on the ﬁeld. Coach Fesler is stressing both the “T” formation and the single wing.

ROTC Eiflers
Hit Top Score

The Pitt ROTC riﬂe team com-
pleted fire in the National Inter-
collegiate Riﬂe match last week by
scoring an impressive combined
score of 7731. Results of this match
will not be known until April 20,
but the Pitt riflers’ s-core which is
21 points higher than last years
winning ’ total is almost sure of
copping the title.

The 15 man team was paced by
Louis Kish, School of Engineer-
ing, who ﬁred at 787; followed
closely by Donald Steed, College,
with a 794.

The 7731‘ fired by the Riﬁers
tops the ﬁlring in six of the last
ten years.'lThe winners in the pre-
vious five years were Pitt, Culver,
Oklahoma, -Maryland, and Minne-
sota, respectively.

He hopes to be able to interchange
these formations ». during ” the sea-
son. The “T”_ advocates speed
while the single wing looks for
power. At present Wes has a
conglomeration of both speed and
power--his only job being to mold
the boys into a winning team.

The backs are all working in-
dustriously——at full there are
Goebble _and Banbury both very
promising lads,,at quarter Tessaro
is hustling and showing himself
to be better than average, at the
halves a medley of skill is evi-
dent, Robinson and Kalminir tops
for spe.ed‘5together with Smodic
and Zirrimovan who are on the
power’ side. “

The line is close behind the
backﬁeld in excelling manpower.
At the end is Skladany who played
in last year’s East and West game,
plus 1VlcPeak and Mihm who show
great promise; at center C1ough-
erty and Haddad are battling out
for the starting position; the other
line positions are well reinforced
with Cerrone, Ranii, and Kosh
standing out.

=Dick Fisher, newly acquired
backﬁeld coach has taken up his
duties.W Dick together with Wes
will decide the Panthers starting
backﬁeld. Fisher is freshr’ from
Ohio State Wher'e he starred for
three years. Although this is
Dick’s ﬁrst coaching assignment
he is conﬁdent that he will be able
to transfer his experience_ to the
Pitt backﬁeld.

Coach Fesler is highly pleased
with the enthusiasm that the boys
are showing, for a team with high
spirit is a very hard team to beat.

Panthers Prime

For Penn Relay

.With the date of their ﬁrst big
attraction of the season hovering
-nearer, iPitt’s «diligent trackmen
are busily -engaged in workouts.

The Panther“ thinclads are elat-
ed to enter the annual Penn Re-
lays at Franklin field in Phila-
delphia on April 26 and 27. This
will mark Pitt’s ﬁrst appearance
at the event since 1942.

At present Coach Carl Olson is
uncertain as to what combination
of relay quartettes he will start.
However,’ at least a one mile relay
squad is ticketed.

‘At present there are almost a
dozen dashmeri vieing for posi-
tions on the mile relay aggregate.
From the‘ promising indoor one
mile distance squad, there are
Herb Douglas, Tommy Carr, Clar-
ence Doak, Eddie Sudzina, and
Johnny Ulam, who replaced Carr
when the latter was stricken with
appendicitis following the Boston
A_:A meet. _Also in line for places
are “Jake” Bergm-ann, Heide, Ro-
maine, and Hartman.

‘There are still many openings
remaining for positions on the
squad for the coming 1946 out-
door campaign an-d Olson will
welcome any and all candidates.

Following the Penn Relays,‘ the
Panthers will engage in a triangu-
lar affair with Maryland and Penn
State.

Reentiy the US State depart-

ment published documents cal-
culat: -..l to prove that -General
Fran:-=') cooperated with Hitler

during the war. Even with this-
evidcnce at hand, millions-‘of
/".rn.e2‘i;:a. 15 will regard the break-
ing of diplomatic relations‘ with
Spain as only another appease-'
ment of Russia. Dictator Stalin
d e m a. n d s international action_
against Efraiico. Because they are
organ Ezcrl, numerically slm a 11

groups of Beds Fascists in France, T

Britain. Belgium, and the US as
well as other countries, speak with
force ifor Stalin and State de-
partments take action.

The Spanish people are being
urged tr: rebel against their civil
ruler ."‘:]d by a “free election”
S‘-.ll3‘E=il.lL.'l.f;‘ a “democrat.” Think of
th.osc zlsinands originating in Mos-

cow, t'.‘(‘; capitol of a nation which
has ism; had a free election in its
liistarry. What if the people ‘in

Spain ‘.2 ere forced to vote for one
set off z.-zindiclutes selected by other
dictato.'s: or not to Vote at-all? Of
coui  that will not happen in
Spain, but would we be compelled
to re;-r:-rnize such an election if it
were if-.:':lCl?

“_But,’ it is said, “Franco helped
Hitler." Didn‘t Stalin help Hitler
to the time the latter turned
against him‘? Did not the Com-
munist papers, and me-in-bers of
the party back Hitler in the early
part oi" the war? “But,” it is also
said, “I4-‘ranco has executed‘ po.lit-
ical p1‘i.s:on-c-21's.” Did not Stalin ex-
cel him on that score by 1000 to 1?

Dr. Car ton Ha-yes, who wasthe
American Ambassador to Spain
during the critic-al years from 1942
to 1945, should certainly be a bet-

‘in North -‘Africa. v.

ﬂeet jand ours-—that it would-have
been‘ easy ‘for him to» have pre-
ventedthe landing of our troops

A few paragraphs taken from
Carlton Hayes’; book ‘are — especially

came to the United States for a
visit in July,.1944:

“I was impressed‘ by the -dearth
of solid information about the sit-
uation in Spain *. ' . Th-e”propa-

obvious'l'y- implatnteda in: the’ Amer-
ican mind a hostilegstereotyper, in
the nature of a caricature, which
the silence of our Government has
served to confirm.”
, Referring -to ‘ another‘ success
achieved with much d_iﬁ’icu1ty,.Dr,
Hayes’ said that “certain journal-
ists and radio commentators. in the
United States, particularly those-
who had’ longbeent more concern-
ed with waging civil war in Spain
(from a safe distance) than with
lighting Germany, tore phrases
loose :l'r_om their context and de-'
duced from them that I and State
department were engaged in the
most nefarious ‘appeasement’ . .
This barrage‘ back home struck
me as both humorous and "pitiful,-
although it undoubtedly gave aid
and comfort to our German en-
emies in Spain.”

Anyone who knows the back.-—
ground of the Civil war, and has
any realization whatsoever‘ of the
devastation“ caused during that
war from which all the people still
suffer; certainly should need‘ no
argument to prove ’th.at=Franco
should not have joined up with
the allies. Franco was far more

‘even a semblance of order in the
nation following the Civil war
without a dictator?

Neither our State department
‘nor the State departments of Eng-
land, France and other countries
would even have thought of tak-
ing action against Spain if strong
pressure had not been directed on
these governments by a barrage of
letters from those who neither love
their own government nor that of
Spain. Within the last few days
the State department gave these
people a verbal slap when they
declared that the present Franco
regime does-not constitute a world
threat in its opinion, and further
action will have to be taken by
those elements in Spain,

So one can now awaken from
this Spanish nightmare to find that
Spain is but herself and no more,
and that Moscow:

Now has a lot of Hitler’s old
territory, -including Latvia, Lithu-
-ania, Esthonia, East Prussia, east-
ern'Germany, Poland, Czechoslo-
vakia, =Hungary, Roumania, Bul-
