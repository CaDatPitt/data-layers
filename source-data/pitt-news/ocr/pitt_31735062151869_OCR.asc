burgh broadcasting stations, besides
presenting special programs on na-
tional hookups.

papers have given the singers favor-
able reviews in their columns, and

Women’s Choral at the University,
speaks of the unit as “one of the best
of its. kind that I’ve ever heard.”

William Stark, C38, chairman Of the
Concert Hours and Brook Chats Com-
mittee, warns those wishing’ to at-
tend to “get there early for the
best seats.”

Faculty Members
To Meet Seniors

At Afternoon Tea

Botany professors will forget their
botany, economic teachers their eco-
nomics, history lecturers, history, and
English professors, their English

themes for a time when they gather

at Heinz House this afternoon to
chat informally over tea cups with
senior women.

Lyda Baltz, C37, chairman of the
tea to be given by the senior women

for men and Women of the faculty

says, “Teas are deﬁnitely in style
this season, for no other social event
provides such an opportunity to dis-
cuss current problems.”

Women, Men Agree
In Latest News Poll

After polling more than 400
undergraduates, The News has
found that a majority of both men
and women favor revival of the
NRA. Men favored the NRA at a
ratio of three to two and women
favored it by approximately the
same percentages.

On the question of “Do you ap-
prove of a married woman earn-
ing money in business if she has
a husband capable of supporting
her?” women said no at a rate of
three to two. Men said no with
greater vehemence, at a rate of
three to one.

;.-Whoa.’ Campus Males Venture
Own Ideas On Local Women

By M. Male

A woman reporter interviewed
‘University women about campus men,
and she ejaculated a gleeful, “Whee!”
After this mere male had inter-
viewed campus men on the subject
«of coeds, the only word in the lan-
guage he found as a complement of
(the "‘-whee” was a plaintiff “Whoo 1”

It seems that there is a seething
‘undercurrent of thought on the sub-
ject, and if it ever came to the sur-
‘face, a catastrophe no less violent than
the demolition of the Cathedral or
the ﬂunking of 200 students in Biol-
ogy 1 would result.

While the women put the men in
either two classes——cocky or silly—
the men are more explicit in their
criticism of the average coed.

“Brains-—nil; looks—average; con-
ceit—enormous.” This is the laconic

reply of a junior who should know
what he’s talking about.

The remainder of the opinions are
no more complimentary although
some of the lads admit that many of
the coeds are easy on the eyes and
too important to ignore.

A senior, spending his fourth year
on campus “looking them over” just
hasn’t “seen any ﬁne specimens of
pul-chritude around, but there’s a lit-
tle freshman here this year, and
while she isn’t pulchri-tudinous, she
is my idea of the epitome of fem-
ininity.”

Most of the women, the same
senior ﬁnds, are quite adept in the
“wiles of the sex.” While another
senior say-s they are “very lovely,
very exciting, but on the whole very
weak on the intellectual side.”

An apparently disillusioned sopho-
more considers them “a pseudo-
sophisticated lot who delight in mak-
ing damn fools of the men, yet they
enjoy having those sam-e damn fools
take them out.”

One junior looked at the reporter
disgustedly and moaned, “Go away;
I’ve gotta toothache.” And a sopho-
more, which probably accounts for it,
merely rolled his eyes and said, “Oh,
boy!”

Dr. Herring will discuss the import
of the coming Pan-American Peace
Conference at Buenos Aires, in which
the United States will play a part.
He will also attempt to crystallize the

towards past and present Pan-Ameri-
can policies of the United States.

Having spent the past twelve sum-
mers in Mexico City as director of
his Seminar in Mexico as well as con-
ducting seminars in Guatemala and
the Caribbean region, Dr. Herring has
had an opportunity to observe the
trend of political and social problems
in these nations. As a result, he is
recognized as an authority on Latin-
American problems.

Since 1928 the speaker has been
executive director of the Committee
on Cultural Relations with Latin-
America. He has also served as di-
rector of the Council for Social Ac-
tion and as secretary of the Depart-
ment of Social Relations of the Con-
gregational Church.

He has edited several books on the
subject of Pan-American relations
and is a contributor to such journals
as The Nation, Christian Science
Monitor, Current History Magazine
and Harper's Magazine.

Community Forum will also hear
Dr. Herring at 8:15 o’clock Monday
evening in Schenley High School. His
subject for the "evening meeting is
“Sweden, a School for Democracy,”
and the address will be based on ob-
servations from his extensive travels
in Sweden.

Women’s Rushing
Ends Th is We e It
In Silence Period

 

There will be no communication,
except a friendly nod, on campus be-
tween fraternity women and rushees
this week. Yesterday Women’s fra-
ternities had their annual fall rush-
ing affairs. Every fraternity enter-
tained its rushees at a tea.

The women rushed were second
semester freshmen and upperclass
women. Freshmen and transfers who
entered the University this fall were
noteligible for rushing until the sec-
ond semester.

During the week, ballots on which
rushees will indicate their choice of
fraternity, will be mailed. The bal-
l-ots must be ﬁlled out properly an-d
returned to Heinz House at 9:30
o’cl-ock Friday morning.

Fni-day nigh-t at 6 o’clock a repre-
-sentative of each fraternity will call
at the University Club to receive the
pledge list of her fraternity. How-
ever, fraternities may not communi-
cate with new pledges until 12 o’clock
Saturday noon when the silence pe-
riod is ended.

The pled-ge ribbons will be pinned
on new pledges and formal pledging
will take place Monday night during
the regular meeting time.

O Open bidding season during which
time any eligible woman may receive
a bid will run from December 7 until
the end of the semester.

Formal At Grotto

 

 

Ryan Makes Preparations
For November Dance

 

Following the Soph Hop in the list
of formal affairs is the Thanksgiving
dance of the College Association,
which is to be held Wednesday eve-
ning, November 25, in the North Side
Grotto.

Leo J. Ryan, C37 , who was recently
elected social chairman, is in charge
of the dance and has already begun
preparations. He promises to secure
one of the outstanding local bands
of the city to furnish the music.

As usual, the proﬁts from this
dance will be added to the College
Association loan fund, which fur-
nishes short time loans to students in
need of money.

Tickets for the formal will be on
sale this week and may be secured
from members of the College Cabinet,
Bill Daufenbaugh, or at the College
ofiice, Room 204, State Hall.

Oetting To Give Recital

An organ recital by William H.
Oetting, professor of music at Pitts-
burgh Musical Institute, will be given
tonight in the PMI auditorium on
Belleﬁeld Street.

Mr. Oetting will play compositions
of J. S. Bach, Jarnefelt, DeLamarter,
Vierne, Franck, and Glokey.

For Human Needs . . .

Eighty agencies, performing hu-
man services of various kinds, ap-
peal for our help in the Commu-
nity Fund campaign.

All are local, long-established
services. They continue because
the need continues.

These 80 agencies, depending on
the Community Fund for support,
are our social responsibility. The
necessity of the work to be done
has been determined by experience
and by intelligent study. All are
for the good of Pittsburgh.

The goal of the campaign this
year in Pittsburgh is $2,789,107.
Success in this appeal depends up-
on the manner in which each in-
dividual answers the question of
participation. Let me suggest that
the University group do its share.

Racusin Resigns

Censorship Probe

Committee Will Investigate
Limitations. On Student
Editorial Freedom

ALLEN, DOREY SPEAK

 

 

Passage of a resolution condemning
censorship of college newspapers
and an address by John E. Allen, edi-
tor of The Linotype News, were the
highlights of the two-day fall con-
vention of the Intercollegiate News-
paper Association held last Friday and
Saturday at Muhlenberg College, Al-
lentown, Pa.

The resolution, which was present-
ed by Albert Bicknell of The Poly-
technic Reporter, and William Dia-
mond of The Johns Hopkins News
Letter, censured any action on the
part of faculty or administration to
“muzzle student editorial freedom.”

Embodied in the resolution was a
provision for setting up a committee
to investigate infractions against col-
legiate editorial freedom, control of
election of student editors by faculty
or administration. The committee was
given the power to publicize its ﬁnd-
ings in leaﬂet form and to mail let-
ters of condemnation to offending
colleges.

Postle Appointed Chairman

A1 Postle, managing editor of The
Temple News, was named chairman
of the committee.

At the banquet which closed the
conclave of the semi-annual conven-
tion, awards were made to the news-
papers which won ﬁrst places in the
three contests sponsored by the INA.

The George Washington University
Hatchet was awarded the gold edi-
torial cup. The Temple News won
ﬁrst place in the news and make-up
contests, with The Lehigh Brown and

Production
Has Story
Of Its Own

Pitt Players’ Show Recalls
George, Mathews Feud
Of Pillows, Beard

 

By Stan Markey

“The First Mrs. Fraser,” to be pre-
sented by Pitt Players November 23
and 24, has a tradition. It all goes
back to the ﬁrst “First Mrs. Fraser,”
that is, the original production.

Gladys George held the title role,
while A. E. Mathews played opposite
her as James Fraser.

Mr. Mathews, it seems, did an ex-
cellent piece of acting, and the critics
took note of it. In fact they praised
him above Miss George, who had top
billing. The latter, her temperament
aroused, resorted to the strategem of
slapping pillows every time Mathews
had a line to speak. Unprofessional
or no, it did have a result.

Mathews, irked, responded by col-
lecting all the pillows on the set and
sitting on the pile during the per-
formance. But for the good of the
production, and possibly for personal
reasons, he decided the method was
impractical.

The ﬁrst scheme abandoned, the
actor went on a no-shave strike and
appeared on the stage every night
with a developing hirsute growth. As

Mathews showed no signs of using his
razor, Miss George appealed to the
Actors’ Equity organization, who, to
her dismay, ruled that it could not
regulate the personal habits of its
members. »

Blocked and tackled at every cor-
ner, Miss George realized the futility
of the feud. An honorable truce was
declared, bearing out the old adage,

- Campus News Briefs -

“The show must go on.”

they are pitted against some 0 e
best of the game. Immediate head-
ache is the Michigan State squad,
which is not only the favorite of to-
_day’s contest, but aside from Wm-
ning the IC4A title for the past three

- years, put the only black mark on

the Panther harriers’ schedule in dual
meets this year. Another team run-
ning in the meet that is a known
quantity to Pitt is that of Penn State-

showing. Captain Dee of the Manhat-

with Phil Smith, Rutgers’ sole entry,
and Woodland of Yale, are but a few
of the stellar cross-country men on
the list of 204 entries out to carry
home ﬁrst place honors in the 28th
intercollegiate championship run. _

After a trial run over the six-mile
course yesterday to renew acquain-
tance with the track, at least seven
of the Pitt squad ran here last year
either on the varsity or champion
frosh team, the Panthers are in the
best of shape for the meet this after-
noon.

Saturday morning the eight Pan-
ther harriers took to the cars of
Coaches Carl Olson and Jimmy Potts
and got under way for Skyscraper-
ville. They will return to Pittsburgh
tomorrow evening

Tost Garners Fourth

The Van Cortlandt Park classic of
last year was copped by Bechtol-d of
Manhattan, with Michigan State and
Cornell runners close at hand. Tost
breezed in three places too late, but
succeeded in placing Pitt among the
ﬁrst four positions.

To date Pitt has a record of four
victories to offset one defeat, the
Spartan saga, in dual meets. Beth-
any College in the ﬁrst meet was jusﬁ
so much cinder path under the tape
with the Panthers digging in to cross
the ﬁnish line one, two, three, four,
ﬁve to chalk up a perfect 15-40 score.
The needle must have stuck in the
winning groove, for a repeat showed
up the next week when the hill-and-
dalers gave Wayne University the big
end of another 15-40 score.

On the same day Pitt gridders
taught Elmer Layden’s eleven some-
thing about football, the champion
Michigan State aggregation handed

the Olsonmen their ﬁrst and only de-
feat. The harriers bounced back the
following Saturdays to chalk one up
over Butler, 19-36, and brought home
the Nittany match despite dual meet
champ Olexy, 25-30.

Nucleus For Coming Season’s Panther Cage Hopes

 

With three weeks of practice gone
by the boards, Coach Carlson’s pro-
teges are starting interclub games
next week so that the squad will be
-well seasoned for their Western trip

next month. Active at practice are

‘ﬁve 1-ettermen from last year’s team,
"Bill Jesko, the captain of the 1936-
337 basketball team; Rags Radvansky,

Bob Johnson, Miles Zeleznick, and
‘Ed Spotovich, who form the nucleus
of this year’s roster.

Pressing the veterans hard is a
stellar batch of ﬂoormen from last
‘year’s frosh team which include Joe
Fabel, a promising center; Jack
Scott, 2. guard belonging to the rare
-order of redheaded basketball tossers;
‘Sam Lindsay, a dependable guard,
and Ed Lawry, a forward whose dead-
eye shooting recalls memories of his
famous brother, Timmy.

Season Opens With Western Trip

Basketball swings into motion
December 11 with only four shopping
days until Christmas for the cagers.
The opening day ﬁnds the quintet in
Evanston, Illinois, trying to earn a
sizeable game to put in the toe of
their stocking from Northwestern.
This Big Ten adversary furnishes a

tough test for Pitt at any point on
the schedule.
Out of a seven-game series between

-the Panthers and the Wildcats, Pitt

has socked away only three with the
Evanston team winning the battle
each of the last two years. It will
take almost Panther grid power to
stow this game away in Dr. Carlson’s
size 12 stocking.
Cagers Meet DePaul Next

The Chicago shopping tour contin-
ues when the basketteers take the
elevated from the suburbs to down
town “Windy City” the following day
to barter with DeP-aul in an attempt
to stow away another in the Xmas
sock.

More basketball energy will be
spent when the Panthers enter a
melee with Butler University, Decem-
ber 14, at Indianapolis. Former
years show a 3-to-1 record with Pitt
ahead.

An auction at the stadium Decem-
ber 21, with the Pitt quintet and
the Wisconsin Badgers bidding for a
final Christmas present tops the pre-
holiday season. The cagers open the
stadium season with the Badger game
—incidentally the outcome of the
past three matches with the Madison
crew has been very black.

Phi Gamma
Delta Enters
Grid Finals

Fijis Convert Extra Point
To Win 7-6 Encounter
From Theta Chis

 

 

Phi Gamma Delta's touch football
nine assured itself of a place in the
Greek ﬁnals by nosinig out Theta
Chi’s surprising aggregation, 7-6, in
a semi-ﬁnal clash at Schenley Oval
last Thursday afternoon.

After repulsing a ﬁrst period
threat by the Theta Chis, the Fiji ma-
chine moved into action in the second
quarter with a combined passving-rum
ning attack, culminating in Harry
Ericson’s sweep over the goal line
for a six-pointer. Passes from Eric-
son to Kohberger, Sawin, and
Schenck, contributed in this march.

Early in the third stanza, Hal By-
ers of Theta Chi, got in front of a
Fiji pass to place the ball in a scor-
ing position for the Dithridge Street
gang. A long toss from Don An-
drews to Byers, good for a 40-yard
gain, gave Theta Chi its six points.
The attempt for the extra point was
smothered by the strong Phi Gam for-
ward wall, led by Art and Rex Wil-
lia.ins.

Lots of Interceptions

The purple-jerseyed outﬁt relied
mainly on short bullet passes from
either Bill Schenck or Ericson to
ends Kohberger and Sawin for its
commendable gains. Theta Chi’s
most effective gaining weapon came
on ﬂat passes from Andrews to By-
ers and Bricker.

Interceptions were 11 u in e r o u s
throughout the four periods, the Phi
Gam line being particularly effective
in rushing the Theta Ch-i passer. Art
and Rex Williams at the guard posts
for the Phi Gams stood out on the
line for the winners with Ericson
an-d E-dmunds starring in the back-
ﬁeld.

For the losers, Bliss Mentzer at
left end and Chuck Cochran at cen-
ter, played Well, while Hal Byers, Don
Andrews, and T-om Bricker did yea-
man woi‘k in the loser’s backﬁeld.

The Phi Gams will meet the win-
ner of the Phi Ep-Kappa Sig and Phi
Delt game. They have now won
three games, having licked Pi Kappa
Alpha and Sigma Alpha Mu, bef-ore
adding the Theta Chi scalp. Theta
Chi had previously beaten the SAEs

and Delta.

Keen Competition Expected
In Thursday’s Event

With only three more days to go
for the Panther Run, Schenley Park
is resounding to the bounding feet
of amateur harriers, who expect to
smash all previous records set by the
former “simon pure” hill-and-dalers.

Fraternities and other recognized
campus organizations are permitted
to enlist teams of seven to contest
for the annual Panther trophy. Last
season the Kappa Sigs copped the
trophy, while Jimmy Wilson broke the
cord to take the individual hon-ors.

The time is 4:30 o’clock and the
course is almost all the streets on the
compass covering all points east,
south, west and north. It should be
a great day for the Feely proteges.

Pitt brand of football showed the

Mid-west that a relation with the Pan‘)

thers is a relation that just won’t
say uncle. First came a highly tout-
ed Ohio State team which fell off the
high perch 6-0. A short time later
it was a green Notre Dame eleven
that was engulfed, 26-0, and Satur-
day topped it all when pre-game-fa-
vored Nebraska felt the thorn of the
Panther attack rather than the
sweeter things in life.

The 19 to 6 count failed to tell
the complete story in the Pitt-Ne-
braska tussle, however, for the Pan-
thers were the superior team out on
the ﬁeld that day. In ﬁrst downs
the Pittsburgh boys led, 23 to 6; in
net yardage the same Pittsburgh boys
topped the Huskers, 330-109. And
all this against the team that lost
out to Minnesota, recognized as one
of the country’s best, in the last 68
seconds through a 74-yard runback
of a punt.

Francis to Cardwell

In the resume of the scoring the
Cornhuskers drew ﬁrst blood when
they aerialed the ﬁrst touchdown, a
20-yard pass from Sam Francis to
Lloyd Cardwell, who caught it over
the goal line. Pitt scored four min-
utes before the half-time whistle
when the Panthers’ Greene slung a
30-yard pass to Johnny Urban, sub-
half, who was downed on the Husker
14-yard line. From here it was Ur-
ban, Stebbins, Urban, and ﬁnally
Greene who pounded over for the
score. Daddio missed the extra point
and the score stood 6 to 6.

All this activity in the Panther
offensive factory ate up three min-
utes of the remaining four minutes
before the half, which left something
like 70 seconds to play. Four plays
later the Panthers had their second
touchdown. Matisi kicked off, Howell
fumbled, Matisi recovered for Pitt on
the Husker 30-yard line, Wood hur-
ried a pass into Daddio’s arms on the

yard throw to Michelosen and Urban
engineered the remaining seven yards
to the goal around left end. Greene

plunged over for the ﬁnal score.

Why A Degree?

T SEEMS that there have been reverberations. In the editorial
column of the last issue of the “Pitt Evening News” it was
noted that a change had taken place. This change was seen to
be a more serious attitude of the evening student toward the
completion of his work—pep, as it were. We were proud to
announce that he would graduate.

We are still proud to announce his anticipated academic
coming of age. He will still graduate; his name is legion; he is
representative of the Evening Session of 1936.

Reverberations are from those who never had graduation in
mind. They have hauled out an old skeleton; now at last may
all skeletons be dismembered, and all ghosts laid. First, it is
evident that for one reason or another there will always be innu-
merable valid circumstances which will prevent some students
from taking their degrees—employment, the time element, heavy
responsibilities—what have you. Second, it is, just as evident
that it will often be beside the point to consider a degree—and
this is the burden of our argument.

For years the question of the value of a degree has been the
invitation for innumerable tilts in all colleges and universities.
For ourselves, we would have it known afar that the value of the
degree, as far as our standards are concerned, is this: the degree
man or woman has passed successfully certain tests by which he
or she may be partially judged with regard to education and
experience. That is all. The degree is no complimentary ticket
to distinction. There are too many really great leaders of thought
today who have been forced to piecemeal their formal education.
The non-graduate is at a disadvantage——yes, but he is still on the
front line of combat. _

In time, the slowest students-those who must be satisﬁed
with classes where and when they can get-them—wi1l have com-
pleted their work. The change in the Evening Classes has been
one of intense effort to.complete that work. For him who must

go slowly, patience !

Honors Students T.

Chapter Gives Certiﬁcates
At Hotel Dinner—Meeting

 

The annual open meeting and grad-
uation of the Pittsburgh Chapter of
the American Institute of Banking
was held Thursday evening, October
29, in the Cardinal room of the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel.

The meeting, conducted by Mr.
James P. Reed, president of the
A. I. B., followed a dinner in honor
of Dr. Harold Stonier, national edu-
cational director of the Institute,
which was attended by a group of
about ﬁfteen of the Pittsburgh dis-
trict’s lea-ding bankers.

After the presentation of the cer-
tiﬁcates to the graduates by Mr. Louis
H. Gethoefer, president of the Peo-
ples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, Mr.
J. Lloyd Mahoney, director of the
Evening Division, introduced Dr.
Stonier, who spoke on “Facing Our
Future.”

Twenty-nine students received cer-
tiﬁcates, ﬁfteen of which were pre-
standard, thirteen standard and one
graduate. These certiﬁcates repre-
sent certain milestones of progress
along the A. I. B. course of study,
which is conducted in the Evening
Division. Many of the A. I. B. stu-
dents are in addition taking other
evening school work.

Rounding out the interesting pro-
gram were selections by the Pioneer
Male Quartet of KDKA, accompanied
by Aneurin Bodycombe, together
with several readings by Miss Flor-
ence Barry, a graduate of the Car-
negie Tech Drama School.

Next Thursday, November 19, the
A. I. B. will hold a forum dinner in
the Cardinal room of the William
Penn Hotel.

Owl To Add New

Evening Section

At a meeting of the Presidents’
Council on October 27, Stanley Roga-
liner, editor of the Owl, year book of
the University, offered the Evening
Session a complete section of the Owl,
to be devoted only to Evening Schoo"l
activities. Each of the twelve stu-
dent organizations in the evening
would be given one page, with sev-
eral more pages reserved for the Eve-
ning School in general.

The Coun-cil expressed approval of
the plan to have the Evening School
represented in the 1937 Owl, which
issue will commemorate the sesqui-
centennial of the University of Pit-ts-
burgh, and took the proposition to
their respective groups for approval.
In order that the Evening Session of
the Owl will be truly representative
of the Evening School the unanimous
approval of all the Evening School
organizations is necessary. This will
mark the ﬁrst time the Evening
School has had a separate section in
the Owl.

Glee Club

Rehearses

Yule Songs

Director Lotz Invites New
Students To Participate

Mr. Fred Lotz, director of the
Evening School Glee Club, has an-
nounced that the Glee Club will soon
begin rehearsals for the carol singing
in the halls during the week of De-
cember 14th. Several new carols will
be added to the repertoire of the Glee
Club, which already includes many of
the old, familiar Christmas songs.

Mr. Lotz declares that previous ex-
perience in singing is not essential,
and urges that all interested students
turn out for the next rehearsal at
which new music will be distributed.

Mr. Lotz has suggested that now is
the appropriate time for new mem-
bers to join the Glee Club. All stu-
dents in the Eyening School who like
to sing for their own enjoyment are
invited ‘to attend the next rehearsal.
The Glee Club operates without dues

and is open to all students. Rehearsals.

are held each Monday evening at 9 :35
o’clock in the Lounge.

Evening Students
Dance At Festival

More than 160 evening students-

drank cider, ‘danced to the lilting mel-
odies of the Jester of Rhythm, and
gambled away hundreds of dollars in
“play” money at a real Monte Carlo,
at the Harvest Festival, November 7.

The lounge, bathed in a soft orange
glow from gayly decorated lights, dis-

played the spirit of plentiful harvests,

as orange pumpkins peeked from be-
hind shocks of corn, and gayly col-
ored leaves festooned the orchestra
stand. All in all it was a grand
par-ty, and many requests have been
received by the executive committee
to hold another one so-on.

Several tables of bridge in Mr.
Mali-oney’s oflice held the attention of
evening division bridge sharks and
winners of prizes felt that they had
been well-earned.

Students Travel
From Far And Wide

A Spanish proverb reads, “He who
would bring home the wealth of the
Indies must carry the wealth of the
Indies with him.” So it is in travel-
ing. A man must carry knowledge
with him if he would bring home
knowledge.

This is the case of hundreds of
Evening Session students, and it is
the purpose of this column to discov-
er, through your cooperation, the per-
son who travels the greatest number
of miles over the period of a week.

John Walker, a member of our
news staff, lives 21 miles from the
University. He has classes two
nights each week and travels a total
distance each week of 84 miles. This
mileage almost equals the distance
traveled by Joseph Johnston and
George Marshall of the Dayton high
school faculty, who come to the
Cathedral once each week, and travel
130 miles in doing so.

How about your distances? Let us
know how far you travel each week.
Send your names and the number of
miles traveled each week to the edi-
tor of the Pitt Evening Session News.

Mahoney Attends
Urban Universities’

Meeting In Detroit

J. Lloyd Mahoney, director of the
Evening Division, represented the
University of Pittsburgh at the an-
nual meeting of the American Asso-
ciation of Urban Universities last
Monday and Tuesday, November 9
and 10. The Association held its
twenty-third meeting this year at the
Host Institu-te, formerly Wayne Uni-
versity, at Detroit, Michigan.

The purpose of this organization,
composed of 50 universities located
in urban centers throughout the
country, is to exchange experiences
among administrators of the various
schools.

The Association alfords officers and
directors of the schools represented
an opportunity to discuss the pr-ob-
lem-s that come before them in the
course of the school year.

Evening School Swim

Set For Friday Night

E. S. A. Schedules Second ‘Splash Party’ At Trees Gym;
Executive Committee Completes Plans For Affair,
Announces Ticket Sale At Cathedral OH-ice

 

Friday evening marks the date of the second E. S. A. swim-
ming party. Started as somewhat of an experiment in the
Evening Student social calendar, the idea has become very
popular, as the enthusiastic group wh-o attended the ﬁrst
“splash party” at Trees Pool on October 23 will vigorously

*<v§aﬁirm. This affair will begin at 8
o’clock, as did the ﬁrst, and continue
till 10.

Open to both couples and individ-
uals, the event promises a lively eve-
ning of good, “clean” fun for even
the most water-shy bather. Tickets,
which are only 25 cents per person,
may be obtained from any of the ESA
Executive Committee or at the Eve-
ning Division oﬁice, Room 142, Cathe-
dral of Learning. Those who are un-
able to decide until the last minute
will of course be able to purchase
tickets at the door of the pool the
night of the party.

Trees Pool is situated at the north
end of the stadium on top of the hill
near the Oakland Cemetery.

The committee invites all those who
enjoy a good swim, a lively game
with a waterball in shallow water, or
an entertaining evening watching the
fun from the seats along the side, to
bring their bathing suits and 25 cents
and to mix with this lively, friendly
group Friday night at 8 o’clock.
