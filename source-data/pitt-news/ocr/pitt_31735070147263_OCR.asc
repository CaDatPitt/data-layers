Swabbing for life, in the   Union

Tegan Hanlon
Senior Staff Writer

Injanuary of 2009, a Pitt alumnus ,

in his third year of Yale Law School A i

noticed a couple of lumps in his_

‘groin. Four months later, doctors . A

diagnosed him with a rare form of

leukemia known as T—cell lympho— ._

blastic lymphoma.

Seun Adebiyi, who graduated 
from Pitt in200‘6t, received a life—~

 

  

I {saving cord blood transplant from
‘the umbilical cord of a Nigerian

couple’s baby a year ago. He re-
ceived the transplant as part of
his cancer treatment —— the stem
cells in umbilical cord blood help
generate new bone marrow and
healthy blood in the person who
receives them.

“If someone turns out to be a

, donor for someone, they might

be the only person in the world

i that is able to match the patient,”

 

Adebiyi said. “I "know that if the
Nigerian couple wouldn’t-have
decided to donate cord blood, I
would have died because there was
no one else.” l _

Adebiyi survived his ﬁght with
lymphoma and is training to be
come the ﬁrst Nigerian to partici-
pate in the Winterolympics, focus-
ing on the skeleton. He, now spends
his time advocating for DKMS, the
world’s largest bone marrow trans-
plant and donation center.

 

Pitt’s Nursing Student Asso~
ciation will hold its second “Get
Swabbed Drive” with DKMS today

and Wednesday from 9 a.'m'. to 4

p.m. in the William Pitt Union.

At the drive, potential donors
will swab their ‘own cheek with a
long Q-tip to test their eligibility.
They will also ﬁll out a registration
form to beplaced on the DKMS
registry. » y S a

‘Doctoral student Mengmeng Li,
studying computer science at Pitt, has
always been an academic anomaly.

During her undergraduate career
at the Northeastern University in her
home country of China, she was one of
ﬁve womenin a class of 30 computer
science students.Asshe achieved high
marks that eventually earned her en-
trance into Pitt’s computer: science
doctoral program, she couldn’t help
but notice that shewas ofa rare breed
a woman pursuing a degree in the

rising ﬁeld.

“I don’t think there are enough
women in the computer science ﬁel ,”
Li said. “In my department, the girls V
still belongvery much inthe minority
inthe classroom.” 2 '

In recognition of her success, Mi?
crosoft recently named Li a recipi-
ent of one of 10 Outstanding Aspir:
ing Women in Computer Science
scholarships, granting her $15,000
among other beneﬁts. She won the
scholarship after being nominated
by computer science faculty at Pitt
and beating out a pool of thousands
of applicants from across the U.S. and
Canada. S

In some ways, Li’s accomplish-
ments” represent a rarity in the ﬁeld

academia typically dominated by
men. Here at Pitt, womenmake up just.

Socialist group discusses implications of Egyptian conﬂict

Ryan Shaughnessy
Staff Writer

Members ofPitI’s International Stndentsforsocial
Equality group met last night in the William Pitt
Union to discuss economic inequalities in Egypt
and around the world. '
The event, held in the Lower Lounge of _the
Union, attractedfewertiianzopeople foralecture
titled “The World Signiﬁcance of the Revolution
in t.” The International Students for Social
Equality, aPitt—based aﬁiliate ofthe SocialistEqual-
ity Party, hosted the event.iThe crisis in one of the
Arabworld’s largest oountries has jumped into the
headlines for more than a month and sparked
related conversation around campus and across
theworld. Manybelieve thatthe departure of1ong-

_ time PresidentHosni Mubarak offers  an

opportunity for democracy. Others fear another
dictatorship will emerge.

Samuel Davidson; astaif writer for World So- . _

cialistweb Site, ledthe discussion onananalysis of
economic inequalities in Egypt and the world.

‘ “Forty percent of Egyptians live on $2 a day,”
Davidson said. “Between 5 and 15 percent of GDP

goestomilita1'yexpendit11res,andEgyptisonthe ,

world’s top 25 worst countries inviolations ofhu-
manrights accordingtoILO [International Labor
Organiza1ion],” he said. '
According to a New York Times publication,
theworld inequality indexshowedthe U.S. at40.8

percentinequality. ‘Dunisiaand Egyptrankedonly V

slightly lower in the index, at39.8 percent and34.4
percent respectively. When askedwhathe thought
the ideal solution would be in Egypt, Davidson
said, “We would like to see socialism. We do not

believethatthe reforrnswillbelastingaslongastlie
military is controlling the reform process.”

Davidson feltthatthe social uprising and lack
ofleadership presentsanopportimityforsocialist
reform, making the typically abstract concept of
socialism tangibleinmodernsociety. ‘

“We’re notttyingto destroythe economy, we’re
tryingto makeitfairsothatasmall minority of
people does not control the majority of wealth
and capital,” Davidson said.

Kevin Foley, president and founder of the
student group at Pitt, added that the SEP idea of
socialism is not to take money and spread the
wealth, butto have a planned economy.

“Thepurpose'ofthe eventisto discussthe im-

minent developments in the Middle East,” Foley I

said. “The protests started in Tunisia but now
spread to Egypt, Morocco, Yemen and Bahrain.
Our view on the whole situation is that there’ is a

lack of leadership in all of these movements.”
Foley added that the Socialist Equality Party
hopes to gain  and inﬂuence by-building
leadership and establishing independent parties
made up of the workingclass inthese countries.
“In Pakistan, the SEP recently helped facilitate
the birth of a new socialist party,” Foley said.
Meredith McNair, a freshman at Pitt who
attended the lecture, identiﬁes as anti-capitalist

because she believesthatpeople on topareintotalv
I control of the government and have distorted

democracyand capitalismandwhatitwas meant
to be.

‘Ewe don’t need a revolution in the USA,just a
changeindirection, perhapsbackto FDR-likepoli—
cies,” she said. “In gé’neral,IhopethatPittstudents
will follow international news and become more
aware of what’s going on in the world.” I

Diversity vital in research

Computer science 4 1

_ students out of 204.

The graduate school has a slightly smaller

' gender gap, with 15 female students out of 92

total. Women also account forfour ofthe depart-
ment’s about 30 faculty members.

The disparity extends well beyond the hall-
ways ofthe Sennott Square building, where much
ofPitt’s computer science department is housed
and where Li attends classes. According to the

0 . nonproﬁt group National Center for Women &

Information Technology, which seeks to cor-
rect the gender gap in the ﬁeld of computer and "
information sciences, girls represented just 18
percent of Advanced Placement computer sci-
ence exam—takers in 2009. That’s the lowest fe-
male representation of anyAP exam, according
to the website. ’

These low ﬁgures translate to equally low
ﬁgures in many graduate and undergraduate
computer science programs around the coun-
try. The center’s website stated that in 2009,
women earned only 18 percent of all degrees
inthe ﬁeld. 0

According to Pitt’s department chair Daniel
Mossé, Pitt’s numbers are “pretty good” com-
pared to national averages. .

* “We are doing well in terms, of faculty and
graduate students in our computer science pro-
gram —— and we are always looking to increase
diversity here,” Mossé said. “Where we could see
improvement is in the undergraduate body.”

Computer science professors and students P
reported a number of factors contributing to
the underrepresentation of women in computer
science —— including cultural expectations, alack
of female role models and lacklusterdiversity
initiatives. _

Li and other women and men studying com-
puter science at Pitt said they are well aware of
the gender disparity and thatit has asigniﬁcant
impact on research and education.

“I thinkwomen have a‘ lot of potential in this
ﬁeld that is nottapped,” Li said, echoingmany of
Mossé’s sentiments. “There is a lot of creativity
involved and this isan area where I think girls
can excel.”

These issues are what motivated Microsoft

. to startgivingoutscholarshipstopromisingstu—

dents like Li in the ﬁrst place, Microsoft spokes-
woman Rachel Hass said.

Hass declined to answer any speciﬁc ques-
tions about Li’s selection or the role of women
in computer science and companies like Micro-
soft, referring all queries to the software giant’s
website. In a recent statement announcing the
winners of the 10 scholarships, Microsoft Re-
search senior research program managerjane

’ Prey addressed the gender gap.

“Microsofcunderstands thevalue ofdiversity
of thought in producinghigh-quality research,”
Prey said inthe statement. “We want to be part of
the solution that brings more gender diversity to

the community. Enabling early—career graduate '
women to focus on research earlier can not only

beneﬁt them, but beneﬁt all of us.”

Back on campus, Li said she has put a lot of
thought into shrinking the gender. gap in com-
puter science. She believes that increasing the
number of successful women professors and
faculty could motivate younger female students
to pursue degrees in the ﬁeld.

“I’ve had afew wonderful [female] professors
who showed me that it’s possible to succeed in
this ﬁeld and gain prestige,” she said.

Li, who earned her undergraduate degree in
information security, has not conclusively settled
onanarea of stndyfor her doctorate. She expects

to settle into apath soon, andwill likely conduct ‘

research on computer architecture or informa—
tion security — particularly involving mobile
devices like cell phones and laptops.

- Another motivation for Li is fellow graduate

’ student Wen Xu, who will graduate from the -
computer science program at the end of this .
semester to take up a job with Microsoft. Like Li, ’

Xu reported sometimes feeling keenly aware of
the gender gap in. computer science programs.

“I do feel the gender gap in the CS ﬁeld,” Xu
said. “I have been intwo undergraduate courses
at Pittwherelwasthe onlywoman there besides
the instructor  Ifeltalittle uncomfortable when
attending the class.”

Still, ‘Li and others in the computer science
department said that awards like the Micro-
soft scholarship are a great way to introduce
women to the great opportunities of complex
computing. ’ ‘ t

“The computer is a mysterious and fantastic
thing thathas allowed us to make such incredible

event. All four are members of the Nursing
Student Association. ~ '

The check swab identiﬁes a person’s hu-
man leukocyte antigen, a protein on the
body’s cells that allows the immune sys-
tem to recognizepthe cells as its own, Payne
said.

“What we’re making" everyone know is
that this is a registry drive,” Cimba said.
“You’ll be on a list, and at any time you can-
‘say you don’t want to be on it.”

Kelly Taylor, a member of DKMS’s donor
recruitment team, said that, as of this past
September, DKMS has made it a full—time
effort to “be very active and reaching out to
colleges and doing donor drives.”

Taylor said that almost half of the people
who go on to donate marrow registered and
went to drives between the ages of 18 and
22. ' —

“Doctors want the young, healthy do-
nors,” Taylor said. ‘fWe have the numbers
that really prove it. College drives are the
best.” _ '

Once on the list, a potential donor can
get a call if he or she ever matches a spe-
ciﬁc patient in need of a transplant. Patients
often have leukemia, lymphoma or other
blood disorders. . .

choice,” Cimba said. .

Willing donors will be asked to undergo
one of two different procedures —— periph-
eral blood stem cell donations, known as
PBSC, or bone marrow donation.

Payne, the event’s co—coordinator, said
the procedures come with “very small”
risks. - ~ V '

Taylor compared PBSC donation to do-
nating blood platelets: A needle is put in one
arm and the removed blood goes through

" a machine that ﬁlters out the stem cells.

It then passes the ﬁltered blood back into
the body through a needle placed in the
other arm. A

“It takes four to eight hours,” Taylor said.

“People sometimes compare it to giving

blood, but it’s deﬁnitely more involved.”

For four days leading up to the donation,
donors are given p'rotein injections. Taylor
said donors report experiencing ﬂu—like
symptoms for those four days that subside
after the blood drawing.

“College kids tell me it’s like a four-day
hangover,” Taylor said.

The second method —‘bone marrow ex-
traction, an out-patient procedure — hap-
pens less frequently, she said.

Doctors put a hollow needle into the back
‘of the pelvic bone and remove cells in an

. hour—1ong process.

“Donors are placed under anesthesia so
they don’t feel anything during the proce-
dure,” Taylor said. “Donors do report lower
back pain for about two weeks afterwards.

It’s why people get so freaked out, and ‘Grey’s.

Anatomy’ doesn’t really help our cause.”

Taylor said patients diagnosed-with a
blood disease have a four in 10 chance that
they will ﬁnd someone on the registry.

“Students need to remember you’re de-
clining this one person who has a minimal
chance of ﬁnding another donor,” Cimba
said.

Tissue type has a lot to do with ethnicity,
Taylor said. All minority groups are current-
ly underrepresented on the donorlist.

“This is another reason we like doing
college drives,” Taylor said. “It represents
a diverse group — the student body.”

Last year 373 students registered at Pitt’s
drive. Of those, ﬁve students have received
calls.as potential matches, and one has gone
on to donate." . ~

Junior Katie Karaffa received a phone call

last week saying that her tissue type matched‘
a patient in need of bone marrow or periph-‘ -

eral blood stem cells. She was swabbed at
last year’s drive.

Karaffa is currently undergoing the do-
nation process that could take up to three
months, éhe said.

“If you can help save a life, I think it’s
totally worth it,” Karaffa said. “The ﬁrst
part is ju_'st,drawing blood, and if you donate
bone marrow it’s just like you fall and'slip
on the ice.” I

Power off that laptop
and learn something  

its lecture halls, you’d likely

fall in one of two categories:
you’d either be upset that you
could no longer play solitaire
during yourreally boring lectures
or you’d be happy you were no
longer distracted by those kids
who play solitaire during your
really boring lectures.

George Washington University
and the University of Virginia are
attempting to squelch the large
number of students who surf the
web during class by banning lap-
top use from some of their lecture
halls, according to the Huff1ng—
ton Post. ‘ ’

Although we don’t approve of
all classrooms prohibiting lap-
tops, we think certain classes
could benefit from such a ban.

Some classes deﬁnitely ben-
eﬁt from laptop use. For example,_
having the Web can allow stu-
dents to look up current events
in political science classes. In
addition, professors can help

cut back on paper by allowing"

students to View lecture notes

' and PowerPoint slides online.

Also, Pitt’s Book Center offered
100 eTextbooks in the fall, which
would become difficult to use in
class under a laptop ban.

Of course, we think students
need to take some responsibility

and use their laptops respectfully '

during class time. It’s rude to be
typing away on Facebook chat
when your professo'r or class-
mates are speaking.

« And of equal importance is

the need to recognize that your
laptop might hinder instead of
help your performance in certain
classes.

According to The Times On-
line, a U.K. news site, “Studies
have found that ‘multitasking’ ac-
tually impedes learning and that
laptops distract not only the user
but also those sitting near by.”

Although some laptop users
might argue that, since they are
paying to be here, the Univer-
sity shouldn’t be able to tell them
whether or not they can use elec-
tronic devices, we feel the same
thing could be argued of atten-
dance policies; And in the end,
you’re going to be better off at-

tending class. While you’re there, ~

you might as well pay attention.
You can play World of Warcraft
when you get back to your apart-
ment or dorm. » I ,

Finally, rather than ban lap-
tops entirely, we think professors
who are bothered by non-class-
related laptop use would benefit
from enforcing strict grade-re-
ducing policies for every offense.
For example, professors could
threaten to drop a student a letter
grade for engaging in non-class-
related laptop activities. After
all, are those pictures from this
weekend that your friend posted
on Facebook really worth more
than a passing grade in a class
you’re.paying to take? We don’t
think so. '

We recommend powering off
for a little bit and learning some-
thing. I

Possible outcomes for Egypt

And why they should matter to you as a US citizen

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Hosni Mubarak, through a mixture

_ of repression; political maneuver-

ing and subsidizing, had managed
to keep an iron grip on Egypt since
1981, with a quiet and sullen order
broken only by protests in 1995 that
ended with broken protestors. It
looked like the Dictators’ Hall of
Fame, which inducts members for
dying of natural causes while still
in power, was sure to gain a new
member. a '
Butapopular uprising in Tunisia
against another strongman, Zine
el-Abidine Ben Ali, led that nation’s
former leader to take an extended
vacation in Saudi Arabia. All of a
sudden, it looked plausible that

_ Hosni Mubarak might be ousted

as well. After three weeks of pro-
tests in Egypt, Mubarak is out and
the nation is being led by a mili-
tary junta thatis moving toward a
democratic transition. We hope.
What happens next is anybody’s

guess, and the United States must

maneuver carefully. Egypt was a -

U.S. ally under Mubarak and is one
of the few Arab states that main-
tains relations with Israel. How true
these facts will remain under new
management has yet to be seen.

As you see the headlines pouring
out of Egypt, you might ask yourself
an important question: Whyashould
any of this matter to me? Whether
Egypt democratizes doesn’t make
an obvious difference to us in the
short term. It won’t get us an iPad,
it won’t affect our own liberties, it
doesn’t seem to have anything to do
with the price of tea in China. And
yet questions of foreign policy are
important to each and every one of
us, and it is vital that we understand
things that happen halfway around
the world. I

There are multiple outcomes
possible in Egypt, and some of
them would end up being very bad.
For example, there are concerns
that Islamic radicals might take
power using means which might
or might not be democratic, mak-

ing Egypt the next Iran. This sec-
ond Iran- could become a major
source of aid to terrorists as well

as an existential threat to Israel. A _

state that provides aid and comfort
to terrorists would make it easier
for Islamic extremists to carry out
attacks in Europe and the United
States. If you plan to hang out in
Europe or the U.S., this might just
affect you.

“ Of course, the outcome doesn’t
have to be bad. Moderate elements
could prevail and Egypt could be-
come another Turkey, a more—or—
less democratic state that is kept

parallels it carries an additional
million barrels per day. If things
go wrong in Egypt, that could all be
disrupted, and all of a sudden you’ll
be paying $4.50 a gallon at the gas

more than just oil. According to
the Egyptian government, roughly
1,400 ships pass through the canal
every month, accounting for about
8 percent of world shipping. The
detour that ships would have to take
in the event of a disruption to the
Suez would be thousands of miles
around Africa, increasing shipping
costs and making consumer goods
more expensive. Recognizing the

SuezCanal’s strategic signiﬁcance,
there is always the possibility of
foreign intervention to try to keep
it open tointernational shipping.
This might sound silly, but the Brit-
ish and French actually did inter-

Suez Crisis of 1956.

‘Churchill’ revels in social satire

Emma Kilcup
For,The Pitt News

“Churchill in Short(s)?”
Tuesday-Saturday at 8 p.m. and
Sunday at 2 p.m. '
Directed by Tommy Costello
Henry’Heymann Theatre
$12-$25

' Grade: A

www.play.pitt.'edu

In “Churchill in Short(s)?,” when
psychiatrist Doctor Hodge (Fred
Pelzer) walks onto the stage in a
tweed jacket and black—p1astic-
framedglasses to begin summa-
rizing each of the characters, the
act seems easy to predict: Hodge,
a Freudian psychoanalyst, will
come to a realization that the
problem is rooted in the mother
and all will be ﬁxed. 

But this is not the case. As the
story progresses and Hodge is,
himself, a character to analyze,
the only reliable element is the
audience’s intrigue. ‘

Until Sunday at Pitt’s Henry
Heymann_Theatre, director Tom-
my Costello will present three

one-act plays drawing from Eng-
lish playwright Caryl Churchill’s
dramas. Though all remarkably
different and hailing from dif-
ferent time periods, “Lovesick,”
“This is a Chair” and “The After
Dinnerjoke” share themes of so-

cial and political _c_riticism that ..

still resonate today. V

“Lovesick” begins the series of
one—acts by introducing Doctor
Hodge and a drama that exam-
ines sexuality within a family.

Although serious issues arise — »

such as one son’s closeted homo-
sexuality and a mother’s affair
with a car salesman — they are
presented in a decidedly humor-
ous manner.

When the doctor’s selfish
motives propel him to alter the
sexuality of his patients, for in-
stance, two German shepherd
dogs, played by Amanda Leslie
and Kevin Christian, comically
interrupt, the scene by snifﬁng
around the floor and patting
characters for attention.

Pelzer balances his role'well
with constant commentary —
extolling his love for a character,
Ellen, while simultaneously car-

rying on a conversation with her
— all in a voice that sounds like a
1960s radio broadcaster’s.

The second act, “This is a
Chair,” is itself a compilation
of seven short sketches. Intro-
duced by avscreen at the back

. of the stage, -headlines include

“Pornography and Censorship”
and “The Democratic Party’s
Slideto the Right,” which lend
social commentary to the oth-
erwiseseemingly meaningless
vignettes. ‘

The title of the act references
René Magritte’s painting, “Ceci
n’est pas une pipe,” which trans-
lates to, “This is not a pipe.” The
painting comments on the fact
that the painting is not a pipe
but instead a representation of a

pipe. “This is a Chair” similarly

alludes to the fact that the play is
a representation. As characters
discuss a drug—induced suicide
and a woman in a barbershop
debates taking drugs for an op-
eration, there are overarching
themes that constantly over-
shadow the action.

The lastlact is titled, “The

‘After Dinner Joke.” Selby, also

Radiohead

The King of Limbs

XIa>Recordings

Rocks Like: Radiohead at its most con-
ﬁdent

Grade: A-

With the 2007 release of In Rainbows, Ra-
diohead seemed to be approaching a halt in
its decade—long quest for music innovation.
Whereas every prior album seemed like
an attempt to reinvent its predecessor, In
Rainbows showed a band ﬁnally satisﬁed
with its sound. Its latest album,,The King

ofLimbs, sounds like the ﬁnal culmination‘ 1

ofihearly two decades of genre-bending

music.

This isn’t an indication that Limbs ——
released last Friday online and set to ship
in physical form on May 9 —. is some sort
of farewell record for the band, but in-
stead a sign that Radiohead is closing in
on its creative goals. The album’s opener,
“Bloom,” features a healthy mix of OK
Computer—style production and classically
rhythmic piano melodies. Thom Yorke’s
iconic voice swoons over the jazz—infused
trumpets and deep piano keys. Like so
many of Radiohead’s songs, “Bloom” is
full of trepid anticipation. Yorke’s char-
acteristic mumble can be heard delivering
lines like, “So why does this still hurt /
Don’t blow your mind with why,” over the
minimalist song structure. '

For a band that has existed for more
than a decade, Radiohead is remarkably

adept at making its music sound fresh. One
of the most striking moments on the album
comes in the track “Feral,” which seems to
be an interlude full of experimentation in
contemporary electronic—music trends,

 

iohead reins in sound on ‘Limbs’

featuring hints of dubstep and European
house music. This comes as no surprise to
anyone familiar with Yorke’s solo effort
The Eraser, in which the frontman relent-
lessly ﬂexes his electronic muscles.

In many ways, The King ofLimbs doesn’t
sound much different from In Rainbows,
but in the moments when the albums’ dif-
ferences are pronounced — the heavily
melodic and acoustic “Give up the Ghost,”
for instance — it becomes apparent why
Radiohead never seems to disappoint.

The video for the single “Lotus Flower”
exempliﬁes everything that is right about
the new album. In Yorke’s seemingly ri-
diculous and spastic dance-moves, there

is a certain confidence — a confidence‘

readily apparent in The King of Limbs, and
the reason for Radiohead’s_untouchable
status in music. “if:

Peep eyes

essentially this sugary snack ﬁghts animal
cruelty.

In 1999, presumably very bored scientists ‘

at Emory University experimented with dis-
solving, burning and disintegrating Peeps
with a variety of chemical agents including
phenol, acetone and sulfuric acid. Sixty-ﬁve
minutes later the majority of the mass of

each Peep was reduced to slime, but the sug-
ary eyes refused to dissolvein anything. Per-
haps they stay in your stomach forever, like
swallowed chewing gum‘? I suppose they’ll
be keeping the cockroaches company in the
event of a nuclear winter.

I mentioned my ill-fated frozen Peeps
venture, but thejust Born company’s ofﬁcial
Peeps website —— oh, it’s a real thing —— offers
presumably better-thought-out recipes for
Peeps Bunny Dips, Drizzle Pops, PEEPSicles
and something described only as “Peeps
Blue Raspberry Sparkle.” If you see it ﬁt to

goes —— my roommates have forbidden me
from any such experimentation.

invincible

The implications of naming a candy man-
ufacturerjust Born could be seen as sinister
in a certain light, considering the encourage-
ment to ingest (replicas of) newborn baby
animals, but further investigation proves the
name choice is not nearly so creepy: Accord-
ing to USA Today, Russian immigrant Sam
Born, following the ﬁne tradition of naming

things after their inventor or owner, opted

for a clever pun in christening his new busi- '

ness venture in 1953. '

Despite the Eastern heritage of their in-
ventor, Peeps consider themselves quint-
essentially American. For instance, I once
had the good fortune of stumbling across
the Peepmobile parked at the Musikfest in
Bethlehem, Pa.’ A tour through its strange
depths was like exploring an especially sin-
gle-mindedly marshmallow-centric Wonka
fantasyland, where dioramas displayed frol-
icking bunnies in psychedelic colors. As con-
solation for being forced to re—enter the
real world upon the conclusion of the tour, I
was given a package of patriotic star-shaped
peeps, the likes of which I had never seen
before nor have been ‘able. to ﬁnd since."

Of course, considering Sam Born’s suc-
cess, Peeps could be viewed as part of a
stellar example of the American Dream.
These lumps of marshmallow are capable
of anything, so why are you still sitting here
readings this when you could be out seeking
sugary, delicious, Peeps? ;e;i -

Panthers star   ro

Dustin Gabler
Staﬂ” Writer

Strong pitching performances
gave the Panthers a solid start to
their season this weekend, helping
them to win two of three games at
the Big East/Big Ten Challenge in
Clearwater, Fla.

The Panthers went 2-1 with
wins against Illinois and Iowa,
followed by a loss to Purdue on
Sunday.

Senior Corey Baker took the
mound for the Panthers on Fri-
day and picked up where he left
off last year.

“I started off the game trying to
throw my off-speed pitches to get
ahead and wanted to keep their
hitters off balance,” Baker said. “I
really focused in on-keeping their
speed guys off the bases and put-
ting the pressure on the hitters.”

Baker pitched six innings sur-

rendering‘ only one run and was
pulled after the sixth inning in the
10-6 win over Illinois.

Baker is one member of a Pan-

, thers pitching duo. _Matt Iannazzo,

who started in-the win on Saturday

over Iowa, was a 10-win pitcherin
2010 along with Baker. I

“We don’t use labels, such as
‘ace’ or ‘No. 1,’ we simply analyze-
our staff and choose our rota-
tion based on what is best for our
team,” Pitt head coachjoejordano
said in an e—mailfollo‘wing Friday’s
game.‘

“Corey got the nod again this
year. Matt will go [Saturday] in an
attempt to win the 3-game series,”
he said.

Iannazzo threw six innings for
the Panthers on Saturday, although
he didn’t pick up the win. He let
up seven hits and two runs while
racking up ﬁve strikeouts before
his team beat Iowa 3-2 in 11 in-
nings.

“I thought both Corey and
Matt did not have their best stuff
on Friday or Saturday,” Jordano
said. “But both absolutely com-
peted big time and gave us a chance

at ‘to win both games; It was a solid

start for each.” ‘

TRACK .3. FIELD-

 

Isaac Saul
Staff Writer

On a weekend where the Pitt

track & field team finished sev-_

enth out of 12’ teams in the Big
East Indoor Championships, it
was a freshman who stole the
show.

Ashley Corum, a long jumper
for the Pitt women’s team, came
away the team’s only champion
after hitting a career best 12.51
meter triple jump at the competi-
tion in Akron, Ohio. She was the
first freshman from Pitt to win
a Big East Championship since
Amanda Walker won the title for
shot put in 2001.

_“I told her, ‘When you go out
there, you get focused and put
a big jump out there right away,
make everyone else come and

get you,”’ Pitt head coach Alonzo
Webb said. “She came in ranked
No. 3, put the pressure on the top
two and made them try and come
and get her, and they couldn’t.”

Corum understood she need-
ed to set the tone, and after hit-

ting a great jump on her ﬁrst run a

she knew she had put herself in
a good position.

' “I just wanted to do my best,”
Corum said. “My ﬁrst jump was a
relief. I knew that would get me
in the ﬁnals and I just tried to
maintain that focus throughou
the ﬁnals too._” A ’

This tournament had been on
Corum’s mind since she came
to Pitt. ‘

“She had her goals in mind
and wanted to be a Big East
Champion as a freshman,” Webb
said. “You never want to discour-

Panthers finish seventh in tourney

age anyone fromthose goals —
even though they were lofty 
but she worked hard at it.” '

Corum wasn’t the only young
athlete from Pitt to show up over
the weekend. In fact, much of
the team’s success came from
the underclassmen.

For the men, it was sopho-
more Tashaun Hill who tied a
career-best time of 8.00 in the
60-meter hurdle. Going into the
race, he had to make the decision
to run on a tight hamstring, but
it was an even riskier decision?
on the blocks that got him off
to a good start.

“I was sitting there waiting
and the guy was holding the gun

for a while,” Hill said. “So I just '

took off and it just so happened

that he shot the gun at the same

time, so I had a good start.”

Pitching leads Pitt to two wins over weekend

“Baseball 4 9

sweep the weekend with a 5-3 loss
to Purdue on Sunday.
“I thought we pitched well [on
Sunday.] It was Ethan Mi1dren’s
aﬁrst collegiate start as well as Matt
Wotherspoon’s ﬁrst time on the
bump,”Jordano said. “We had our
opportunities in a few innings to
gain a solid lead but we came up
short.”

Pitt 10, Illinois 6

On Friday, Pitt’s offense found
its rhythm in the ﬁfth inning. After
being shut out until that point, the
Panthers exploded for 10 runs in

d ‘(the inning.

Zach Duggan and Ronald Sucre
began the inning with key bunts,
something that Jordano believes
every player in his lineup can do.

“I believe we do a great job of
understanding situational ABs’[at—
bats] ,” Jordano said. “If a hunt is
called for, anyone in the lineup is
capable and prepared to execute
it.”

David Chester, a Pitt senior,
cleared the bases with ‘a triple to

left center ﬁeld. He went 3-for-4
on the day. ,

“David is a big piece of our of-
fense — he is strong and has a
great feel at the plate,” Jordano
said. “I expect David to have avery
productive year.”

Pitt 3, Iowa 2

Saturday’s offense was less po-

- tent but the Panthers took advan- ‘

tage of mistakes by Iowa in the sev-
enth inning to score two runs.
The only earned run for the
Panthers came inthe 11th’ inning
when Sucre collected the only ex-
tra base hit — a double —- and

thersin the ninth inning to protect
Iannazzo’s lead and got histeam
out of two situations with the bases
full without allowing a run. _
Black’s work in the ninth and

this season, but Jordano has yet

to decide what his role will be this

year. A

Freshman Casey Roche came in
and retired the Hawkeyes consecu-

~ tively in the 11th inning to give the

Panthers their second win. A
Purdue 5, Pitt 3
Sunday’s game looked to be

the most difﬁcult for the Panthers
against a tough Purdue squad that

had knocked off a ranked Connect-
icut team on Friday.

The third starter in the Pan-
thers staff, Mildren, still pitched a
solid game on Sunday. He allowed
four runs, one being unearned.

’Mildren struggled early in his
ﬁrst start allowing two runs on
three hits in the ﬁrst inning. He
settled in until the sixth when two
more runners crossed the plate.

The Panthers made a late-in-
ning attempt to win the game by
putting two runners on base for
Chester to try his heroics again.

This time, he grounded‘ into
a ﬁelder’s choice play to end the
series.

Despite a bitter ending, the
Panthers hail a productive week-
end in Florida. Pitt picked up two
wins and gained valuable experi-
ence for some key freshmen.

“It was a solid start. I could not
have asked for a situation that ﬁve
or six freshmen. got a chance to
gain some experience. In that re-
gard it was great,” Jordano said.
“The baseball was very competi-
tive. Very well-played games.” I

Despite the good start and the
career best, both Hill and Webb
think the runner could take an-
other step forward.

“He still isn’t where we expect
him to be,” Webb said. “Some—

thing big is coming here — we “

‘thought it might be this week-
end. Even though he’s compet-
ing very well right now, we know
that there is more in him.” ,

“I’m not going to say I had
the best race,” Hill added. “But
I’ll take it. I’m happy with the
results.”

Dontave Cowsette, a junior, _

also had a season best when he

ran the 800 meters in 1:50.59.

Both Cowsette and Hill fin-

ished third in their respective
yevents. -

“I was happy to make the
podium,” Cowsette said. “I felt
pretty good throughout the race.
I just went in with a clear mind-
set and went out and competed

$0 the best of my ability.”

Senior Garrett Larkin fin-
ished ﬁfth in the shot put and ju-
nior Kurt Barnhart ﬁnished just
behind Larkin with a throw of

16.82 meters —_ a career best.

Overall, however, the week-
end wasn’-t a big success for the
team.

“I think the whole team
thinks that seventh place isn’t
to our full capability,” Hill said.
“We have the talent to be at least
top-three and even win the Big
East.”

Although the weekend might
have left a sour taste in the ath-
letes’ mouths, Webb feels that
the team is doing a lot of things
right and that there is a bright
future ahead.

“We have a pretty strong nu-
cleus here and we’re going to add
to it next year with some good
recruits,” Webb said. “Things
are looking up.” i

For now, the team will begin
to look forward to the outdoor
season, which starts on March
18.

“We’re still taking steps to
being [in] the top three in the
Big East,” Hill said. “Hopefully
we’ll be doing better during out-
doors.”I
