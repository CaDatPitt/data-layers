Page 2-"Monday, December 8, 1980 

Every Friday night, Pittsburgh’s
meddling bureaucrats and sneaky
politicians get the shaft.

Because every Friday, . Dave
Kelly presents the Golden Shaft
Award to whomever isn't giving
Pittsburghers a fair deal.

Kelly, a news’ commentator for
WIIC-TV, combines Irish wit with
sharp sarcasm in speaking out for
the Pittsburgh community.

Kelly explained in an interview

,_ that the average person “doesn’t

really have anyplace to go,” and
through the presentation of the
Golden Shaft Award he gives them
an outlet they might not otherwise
have.

"The working stiff is still the guy
who pays the bills in this country
and he’s the one I really feel
an affinity for and try to direct
myself to," Kelly said. “I assume
everybody’s like me: they either
work or they've been laid off, and
they’re trying to pay off a mortgage
and a couple of cars. I .

“They generally have the sam
problems I do, so I kind of gear
myself to the average individual.”

Kelly added that many of the
recipients of the Shaft award are
suggested by letters and calls from
lhis audience.

“An awful lot of ideas come from
the people who call talk shows and
watch TV. They observe the
passing scene and feel they’re
being done in and they’re not too
happy,” Kelly said.

In fact, the idea for presenting a H

Golden Shaft came from one of
Kelly’s listeners. One sent Kelly a
letter suggesting that he award a
Golden Shaft every week to some
“deserving recipient” and sent
Kelly an old shaft welded to an
upright with a plaque on it.

“It’s been alive and‘ well ever
since," Kelly commented.

A The Shapp years and PennDOT
were frequent recipients of Kelly’s
Shaft award. '

“I guess the Shapp years
contributed more to the Golden
Shaft than anything else,” Kelly
explained. “People were always
being indicted and convicted.
PennDOT, for a long time, was a
noble recipient every week; when
in doubt, give it to PennDOT
because PennDOT invariably
deserved it. The roads were falling
apart and no money was being
spent to fix them. Most of their
people were going to jail, and
everytime the sherrif’s van left
Pittsburgh it had 15 or 20 ranking
PennDOT officials in it.”

How do the recipients of Kelly’s
Shaft awards feel about their
dubious distinction?

“I sometimes get anger and
threats of violence, and other times
I get calls saying ‘When do I get
the award? I'd like to put it on my
desk so everyone can see it,’ ”
Kelly said.

Despite the sometimes hostile

reactions he gets, Kelly said he has ‘

never been sued for libel or
slander.

“The best defense for libel and
slander is the truth, and I've heard

that as long as I'm hanging on the

truth that leaves the person who
want-s to sue me kind of

-p shorthanded, " Kelly said.

Kelly described «himself as
liberal in some areas and conser-
vative in others.

“I’m in favor of capital punish-
ment, and I'm against abortion
when it’s used as a means of birth
control,” he said. “On the other
hand, I feel strongly about the
social programs that come along.
I’d hate to see a new administration
come in and wipe out needed
welfare beneﬁts and socialsecurity
benefits, and the other things that
have been achieved.”

Pittsburgh is a strong labor

town, according to Kelly, and-

Pittsburghers tend to hold more
liberal than conservative view-
points.

“There were a lot of unions born
here, and people still feel strongly
about them,” Kelly asserted.
“They’ll still back Democratic
candidates over Republican candi-
dates because I think Pittsburgh’s
laboring majority feel that Repub-
licans tend to be big business, and
big business is evil.”

Kelly’s role as commentator for
WIIC is one of the many positions
he has held in the various media. A
Massachusetts native, Kelly ma-
jored in journalism at the Univer-
sity of Maryland and upon
graduation was hired by The
Washington Post. In 1957
he came to Pitts-
burgh and worked
at the Pittsburgh"
Press as a feature
writer, columnist,
“whatever else.”

In 1961, he went to KDKA
radio to work in the program
department, moved onto radio

and

news, and eventually became

the radio news director. Kelly then
switched to television and in 1963
was hired as KDKA’s TV news
director. He was employed as a
news director for WIIC until 1969,
when he worked as a radio and TV

medium you can expand on a story.
Here, (at WIIC) if I've got a story
about a problem somebody’s
having with PennDOT or difficulty
with their public housing and the
city won’t fix it, I have a minute to a
minute and a half to tell the story.
In print you have considerably
more time, and this gives you the

ability to research stories" and‘

develop and expand them.”
Kelly said that when he began
his career in television, anchormen

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
    
 
  

news director in Washington and _-

Detroit before returning to
WIIC.

As a veteran of
the various media,
Kelly said he ﬁnds
Pittsburgh “a great media town.’_’

“I think the three television
stations prove that,” he commen-
ted. “These stations are extremely
competitive and way ahead of their
time nationally.” _

Pittsburgh newspapers did not
fare so well in Kelly’s estimation.

“,1 think they’re awful,” he said.
“The Pittsburgh Press, being’ a
nationally owned operation...
doesn't do enough research. It
glosses over things that are vitally
important. and it tends to be more
feature oriented than news orient-
ed."

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
does a better job than the Press,

according to Kelly, but he added,_

“The Philadelphia papers do a
much better job of covering"
Philadelphia than the Pittsburgh
papers dog of covering Pittsburgh. ’ ’

Kelly noted that the biggest

“But it all turned around and
went the other way,‘ where you hire
plastic people who can read stuff
that comes off the wire but can't
write their name and couldn't go
out and report a story if their life
depended on it,” Kelly explained.
“I think there are many of them in
this country who are plastic people,
who look alike and sound ‘alike,
with deep voices and wavy hair and
nice features.” ‘

Kelly predicted the trend would

turn the other way again.

‘ ‘I think I'm a walking case of the

I   Ka|eidoscope||- AConference on Higher Educati

By BETHANN INCOLD
The Pill News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Higher Education Program
is sponsoring Kaleidoscope II, a
conference of over 30 presentations
on yarious higher education issues.

 
 

 

Presentations will run concur-
rently throughout the morning on
Dec. 13, following the orientation
to the day at 8:30 a.m. A luncheon
honoring the Higher Education
Program's 1980 Distinguished
Alumna, Dr. Lucie Young Kelly,
will follow the presentations.

“Kaleidoscope II has both an
educational and social purpose.
We’re trying to provide an oppor-
tunity for people to come and talk
about issues in higher education as
well as an opportunity to bring
together our alumni, our graduate
students, our faculty and anyone
else in the university who wishes to
come, to talk about issues of higher
education,” said Dr.’ Patricia
Crosson, assistant professor in the
Higher Education Program and
coordinator of Kaleidoscope II.

To organize the conference,
letters were sent to all alumni,
faculty and students in the Higher
Education Program, asking for
individuals who wanted to present
a relevant topic in the conference
Crosson said. “We also sent it (the
letter) out through the School of
Education Alumni News which
goes to-‘ all School of Education
alumni, students and faculty.”

The topics ‘were then chosen
from the individual responses.
“We tried as much as possible to
give people the opportunity to do
what they wanted to do and we
tried for a variety of issues,” she
said.

Some of the presentations are on
issues such as:

—international higher education
programs

—faculty self-development

—time management tips

—handicapped students in col-
lege

-—leading universities in the

l980’s
—students and higher education

—missing link in college science
teaching

“The whole series an inter-
national higher education pro-
grams should be very interesting,”
Crosson said. There are presenta-
tions on the higher education
programs of Japan, Brazil, Vene-
zuela and Germany. Crosson said
the contrast of these countries with
each other and with our system
should be “very neat.”

“Some of the presentations
might be speciﬁcally of interest to
students. They can hear what
some of the research is that’s going
on right now, that’s going to affect
them in their every day lives,” said
Samuel D. Deep, currently on
special assignment in the Provost
Ofﬁce.

Deep gave a presentation last.
year at Kaleidoscope I on student
retention and will make a joint
presentation with Dr. John C.
Weidman this year on “Enrollment
Enhancement in the Multiversity. ”

‘ Crosson, who will give a
presentation on the results of a
study she did concerningthe ways
the state plans to deal with
enrollment decline in Pennsylvania
and the problems that are likely to
occur within 10 years said, “I think
there are some events that might
be of interest to more than just our
own students and faculty and.

they do every day. That's the
unique aspect of being a higher
education program within a higher
educational setting.”

Last year at Kaleidoscope l, the
presentations were all given by
students in the “Core,” which is
the course that all beginning
graduate students in the Higher
Education Program must take.

“We were all asked to present
‘our papers that we had done,” said
Cheryl Finlay, a member of the
Core last year and current director
of career planning and placement
at Point Park College.

“I think it (Kaleidoscope I) was a
very good experience. The
exchange of ideas and discussion
between faculty, alumni and
students were beneﬁcial and it was
fun,” Finlay said.

 
 

“I think Kaleidoscope II is
unquestionably going to be more
enjoyable and better than (Kaleid-
oscope I) because there's a wider
variety of papers and a wider
variety of presenters. not just the
Core.” Deep said.

Kelly will speak at the luncheon
on the topic: “The Living Poor-
The Future of Higher Education?"

Crosson said in choosing the
recipient, ‘‘I sought nominations
from alumni, faculty and students
in the program."

A selection committee then
reviewed the nominations and their
accomplishments and selected
Kelly, she said.

Kelly is one of the ﬁrst graduates
of the Higher Education Program.

'|11e Futire
of Residence Life

The Housing Office is at it again. The loss of the
Tower B lounges looms ominously in the air for next
term, and resident life at Pitt seems ready to be sub-
ject to another unfortunate mutation.

It is surprising how many students are waiting to
make the Pitt dormitory facilities their semester
homes. The rooms on campus range from $150 to
$250 per month, and the cries we hear from the on-
campus crowd are more negative than positive. The
biggest insult to those students who find it necessary
(or mandatory for some on scholarships) to live on-
campus still remains the visitation policy, a policy
that never needed to be changed, just enforced in the
way it previously existed.

But now some of the lounges are threatened with
extinction, and for those who have had the great for-
tune of a Towers experience, we sympathize with
those students who face the loss of the only non-
claustrophobic areasiin the Towers other than the
washrooms. V

The lounges are a pivotal part of dormitory life.
They give the students release from their cramped,
stark, pie-shaped homes. They provide a center for
social and academic alternatives, where one can
either stretch their legs and watch a football game or
movie in color, or show consideration fora sleeping

roommate when an all-night study session becomes
necessary. .
Finding housing for deserving Pitt students is an
important objective of the university. But it is a
shame to pursue solutions at the expense of those
currently residing in the dorms. It is difficult to say
whether Pitt anticipated dissolution of the lounges to
satiate the glut of on-campus applicants when the
Towers were under construction, but they must have
known that giving the students the luxury of a
lounge, and then revolking it would cause an uproar.

What would easily serve as a possible solutionfs
the securing of space to build another dormitory.
This is a large-scale project that would require years
of planning and construct-ion, but it is a suggestion
that the university should be taking seriously if it
already hasn’t. More than likely, the future holds in-
creases in applicants for on-campus housing. What
happens when all the lounges are full? What other
tangible and intangible restrictions will be levied

' against the current on-campus students when the

waiting list takes on an exponential ascendance in the
years ahead? We are curious to see how the univer-
sity plans to accommodate the future of residence life
at Pitt. ' i

Pi it News Sports Coverage of Piﬂ-Penn State Contest is Deficient

To the Editor:

We've never considered The Pitt
News’ sports coverage anything
impressive in our three terms here
at Pitt, but you have now reached
new depths with your coverage of

last weeks Pitt-Penn St. football

game. We are referring to the fact
that there was only one story of
moderate length and low quality
describing the game. That one

story presented little more than a
dull. factual account of the game.
The biggest game of the year was
treated as if it was an exhibition
game.

Apparently, The Pitt News did
not feel a game between the 4th
and 5th ranked teams was
deserving of on-the-scene coverage
by. itsjstaff. We say this because

and the events surrounding it
accompanying the lone article.
We realize that there would have
been some expense and inconven-
ience (with Thanksgiving break and
ﬁnals) for The Pitt News and its
staff,‘ but they saw ﬁt to sacriﬁce a
weekend to go‘ to Florida to
bombard us with extensive cover-
age, including» a full front page
photo, of the Panthers’ loss to

Florida St. The Penn St. game was
at least as deserving of such
in depth coverage by The Pitt
News. Surely several Pitt News
staffers could have made it to the
game, as did some 5,000 loyal
Panther -fans. This is not an
objection to the coverage‘ given the
Florida St. loss so much as the lack
of coverage given to the Penn St.
game in comparison.

Even - though the major bowl

‘committees saw. fit to overlook the I

4th ranked team in the country‘, it’s
hard to comprehend how The Pitt
News _could almost completely
ignore the Panthers’ in their game
for _the Eastern Championship. ;

To the Editor:

One simple question. It seems to
me that Pitt played a football game
against Penn State on Nov. 28. It
also occurs to me that we won that
game with a score of 14-9. Now for
my question. Why were there no
pictures in this ﬁne publication of
that all important game between
these arch-rivals? After all. didn’t
this game determine the Eastern

Championship?, This game also

Expressing‘PersoI1’\Mll1outS|ayirIgGenderint|1eProoess

By NICK ARNETT ‘

The Pill News Stall’ Writer KT
My sister left the cloisters of
Chatham College to join us for
Thanksgiving dinner at the family
farm, where shevdiscussed ‘per-
sons’ with us. It was her second
Thanksgiving dinner this fall; her
ﬁrst was offered by Chatham’s food

A_ SCFVICC .

.g,_

a

Echoing the tradition of having
one’s family assemble for turkey,
some of the Chatham women (or
Chatham Women, as they write at
CMU) were joined by their
paramours. Yes, paramours. I
hesitate to call them anything else.

As my sister recited the list of
people at her table during the
collegiate feast, she'd occasionally
mention a male name (Chatham is
an all-female school) and my
mother would interrupt, “Who?”
My sister would reply that the
young man in question was
so-and-so’s “person.” Not friend,
boyfriend, nor lover, but “per-
son.” You know, like Ronald
Reagan’s person, Nancy, who’ll
soon replace Jimmy Carter's
person as the First Person, I
suppose. ’
ongoing difficulty for people to
choose a word to describe a person
of the opposite sexwith whom they
like to spend-time. (See, I had
trouble explaining what I was

' saying.) However, “person” does

not seem to be a very good
alternative. Perhaps I should say, it

is not a “viable alternative,” to

maintain the current jargon.

I remember reading some time
ago,'when it was still daring to
share an apartment with a
“person,” about the troubles such
unmarrieds experienced when re-
ferring to each other. They couldn’t
say “husband” or “wife,” since
they weren’t. “Roomie” made
them sound like sorority sisters. I
believe "the ultimate‘ solution was
for them to call each other
“friend.” Again, not a “viable
alternative.” I used to suffer with a
“person” who consistently intro-
duced me as her “friend, Nick.” If
that's what a friend is, I’ve got few.

So why do women call the men
they date"‘persons?” I guess it's
one step away from “boyfriend” or
“girlfriend” to some, but many of
my friends (the acquaintances with
whom I am not currently romantic-
ally involved) refer to their regular
dates as their “persons.”

It might be an offspring of gay
liberation. By referring to your
partner as simply a “person,” you
don’t reveal the “person’s”
gender. I suppose that using the
term “person” might be a way for
a homosexual to put one foot out of
the closet. However, I'm fairly
certain that the majority of the
people I hear talking about their
‘persons” aren’t gay. Yes I’m
fairly certain, I guess.‘

“Person” might be a sympton of
feminism. Chatham is a spawning
area for latent feminists, I believe.

However, if a young lady intro-
duced me as her _“person, Nick"
I'd make a couple of assumptions
before taking my leave.

First, I'd infer that she felt
possessive. “Mypperson” sounds
much more like a belonging than a
description of a mutually beneficial
relationship. Second, I'd assume
that the reason she was hanging
around with me had nothing to do
with‘sex, since a “person” implies
no gender.

I think that if I was introduced as
someone’s “person," I'd make it
clear that I am not anyone's

 

“person" and excuse myself.
“Friend," perhaps; “person,"
never.

“Person" is an impersonal term,
strangely enough. It conveys

non-involvement, as in the phrase I

which high school girls use to
account for their dates to their

‘parents: “Oh, he’s just a person.”

“Person" is» probably the “in"
phrase for high society: “Hi! I’m
Kelly and this is my person, Raoul.-
He cleans barnacles off our yacht.
Isn’t_ it just decadent?” Such jargon
seems more proper when uttered
by empty “persons.”

Personally, I wouldn't mind
having a clear term to use in each
situation. I used to think that
friend, boy- or girlfriend, lover,
and spouse functioned well, but
“people" seem to require subtle
shadings. I guess “steady" sounds
juvenille to some. but it seemed to
express the same thing as
“person" without slaying gender
in the process.

None of this really disturbs me,
however.
people I know, although I'm not

willing to'be a person for any of 7

them.

Tower B Hall Council Protests Lounge l-lousing

.-"

To the Editor: - A

It has come to the attention of the
resident students of Tower B that
our lounges are being considered
as a site for temporary housing
during the winter term. We are in
protest against any such action or
even the consideration of such
actions.

Students and/or their parents
pay a phenomenal fee of $300.00
per every two students per room
per month. This is a bit exorbitant
for an incommodious little room,
which affords little privacy or living
space, a communal bathroom per
floor, a small.lounge for every three
ﬂoors that is set aside for studying.
watching television, and for social

gatherings. This loungeis the
pivotal point of our community life.
It offers a place to relax, exchange
ideas, study, and it is especially
important during the winter
months. It offers that extra
“breathing space” that is so
necessary when -a person is
confined to close quarters with a.
roommate for extended periods of
time. The lounge is the difference
between being a close-knit com-
munity or just three floors of
nameless occupants.

We understand that the univer-
sity may feel an obligation to find

"temporary housing for incoming

students. In the past, it has been

the practice to utilize student ..

lounges for this purpose. Although
the university was able to take
advantage of the apathy or

reluctance of past students, it by no ~
means justifies the continuation of '

this abusive policy. It may be the

university’s responsibility to find '

locations for temporary housing,
but not at our expense! If a viable

"solution cannot be worked out, then

perhapsthe university needs to

take a closer look at the policies of 1 »

its housing department.

factors. But, often times, it is the
result of early social experience in
high school or college.

“You can look at a college
population and observe their
drinking habits, and you may not
be able to point to someone in
particular and say he will become
an alcoholic, but later on, when you
encounter someone with a drinking
problem and you look back, you
notice certain patterns,” said
Shirley Hill, director of the
Substance Abuse Clinic at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

While there is no alcoholic-prone
personality type, Hill said there are
a number of identiﬁable character-
istics which can distinguish the
possible alcoholic. Most prominent
among them is a history of
alcoholism in the family.

Problems with drugs and alcohol
seem to stem from the fact that
they are convenient sources of
satisfaction that replace more
conventional and demanding en-
deavors.

“Street racing was my thing, I
used to spend hours ﬁxing up my
car for a thrill that would last a

couple of seconds. Later, I got into
heroin, and that was it, it was so
good, and it was so easy, my whole
thing was feeling good,” said one
resident.

One of the difﬁculties an addict
faces as he tries to kick his habit is
society's attitude toward the
junkie. While the alcoholic ﬁnds a
certain amount of sympathy and
understanding for his problem, the
addict is looked upon as a pariah.

“When I was getting started. in
the late sixties, people thought Y0“
were pretty odd if you didn’t have
long hair and did drugs. It's ironic
that the hippies were all about
honesty and peace and love, and
now that the door has slammed
shut, the lucky ones have gone
white-collar, while us junkies are

out in the cold holding the bag. I
think a lot of people in my situation
feel betrayed,” one resident said.

Narcotics Anonymous, a self-
help program for addicts modeled
after Alcoholics Anonymous, holds
its meeting at the Alpha House at
435 Shady Avenue. The. program
approaches the problem of addic-
tion on a day-by-day basis. The

residents say it is one of the
toughest programs going, but that
it has helped them tremendously.

“We get support here. I hear
about experiences from other
people with the same problems as
me, and it makes me realize my
situation is not that unique." one
resident said. ~

Alcoholism and drugs are both
addictions and have more in
common with each other than there
are differences between them. The
essential fact is that the person has
to realize that there is a problem,
and that somehow he must help
himself.

“When I came here, I swore up
and down I wasn’t an addict. I
used to lock myself in a motel room
for the weekend and shoot up a
quarter-ounce of coke, and I never
once thought of myself as someone
with a problem. Here I had people
telling me you're a goddamned
junkie, and it ﬁnally sunk in when I
realized there were people here
who were doing less stuffthan I
was,” one resident said.

Addiction is a dramatic disease
when you see it in a heroin user, or

a advanced alcoholic, and most
people have a hard time connecting
their own recreational use of
alcohol, or drugs, with the junkie’s.

“Those people that have a few
drinks to unwind, or blow a little
coke at parties, or say it's only
"reefer, should be honest with

 , ._.5 *z*"< _
themselves and ask the question.
‘what exactly is it I’m doing here.
can I, get along just as well without
it,” one resident said.

Panthers Finish Last in Missouri

By MIKE DICHIARA

The Pitt News Sports Writer

The Panthers entered the pres-
tigious field of the Show Me Classic
in Columbia, Missouri. with a 2-0
record and a sparkling defeatof St.
Bonaventure in Oleon, N.Y. Play-
ing against the likes of’ Missouri,
Lamar and West Texas State would
surely be an excelleant test of the
Panthers national potential. But
losses to Lamar, 67-65, in the first
round and to West Texas State,
92-73, in the consolation round
resulted in a fourth place ﬁnish in
the four team tournament.

The loss to Lamar in the ﬁrst
game on Friday night was not as
close as the two point difference
indicates. Lamar jumped out to a 10
point lead at the half, 33-23, mainly
because of the Panthers very poor
shooting - only 33 percent from the
floor and 43 percent from the foul
line. Probably the two best
shooters the team has, Carlton
Neverson and Clyde Vaughn,
combined in the ﬁrst half to shoot a
dismal two of 14 from the ﬂoor. As

,a result, Sam Clancy ended up

being the leading scorer at the
intermission with only seven
points, although he also had eight
rebounds.

On the other side, Lamar’s Mike

Oliver led all scorers with 30
points. B.B. Davis complimented
his teammate with 15 points and 15
rebounds. After eight minutes in
the first half, Pitt still had a one
point lead at 11-10, but the
Cardinals took the lead for good
behind the hot shooting of Oliver
and the leadership and playmaking
of Alvin Brooks.
A In the second half, Lamar
expanded theirlead to as much as
16 points as the Panthers could
neither shoot welllnor break the
Cardinals 3-2 zone. With a little
over six minutes to play, Lamar led
58-44. The Panthers ﬁnally got hot
and scored six straight points to cut
the deﬁcit to eight at 58-50.

However, with three minutes" to
play, Pitt trailed by 12 on the
strength of a Brooks jumper. The
Panthers continued to pressure
Lamar into mistakes,‘ notably
missing free throws, and scored the
last eight points of the game, with
Clancy hitting a shot at the buzzer
“to makethe ﬁnal score 67-65.

“If we had played the ﬁrst 30

minutes like we played the ﬁnal 10,

USC Dumps N D,;,Pi tt Standsto Gain mpolls

By JEFF DUROSKO
The Pill News Sports Writer

Pitt’s national championship
hopes were aided Saturday when
the Southern California Trojans
upset second ranked Notre Dame
20-3.

The Trojan defense was awe-
some and held the Irish to just 120
total yards to drop Notre Dame's
record to 9-1-1 and virtually
eliminate the Irish from the
national championship race.

That Trojan defense was at its
best in the game's third period.
The Irish marched to the USC
3-yard line, but was shut down on
four straight running plays,’ includ-
ing the final two from the ‘l-foot
line. ‘ P ,_ ' '

we would have won,” said head
coach Roy Chipman. “I thought we
had quickness in our backcourt, but
they were even quicker than us.”

The next night, the Panthers
were matched with the losers to
Missouri in the ﬁrst round, West
Texas’ State. With a-new chance to
salvage some dignity against
another quality opponent, the
Panthers failed miserably by a
score of 92-73.

But the same problems that the
Panthers suffered against Lamar
were as evident against the
Buffaloes. The Panthers shot a
remarkably low 36 percent, hitting
only 29 of 81 shots.

Pitt opened the game fast
against West Texas. Pitt led early
by 10 points, 18-8. With center Ed
Scheuermann taking charge both
offensively and defensively, Pitt.
managed to keep a eight point lead
with just over ﬁve minutes in the
half. Then disaster struch as West
Texas ran off 16 consecutive points
in the remaining four minutes of
the ﬁrst half to take a 40-31 lead
into the locker room. Buffalo Terry
Adolph was the key as he pumped
in 14 points and had 11 assists on
the game. To coach Chipman, he
was the difference in the game.

Eddie Harris added some spark
to West Texas in the second half
after Pitt had cut the diﬁcit topsix at
46-40. Between Harris and Adolph,
the Panthers were unable to control
them and the ‘Buffalo lead balloned
to 14.

Turnovers also played a major
part in the demise of Pitt. The
Panthers committed 17 turnovers
in the first half and managed to
equal that number in the second
half.

“Late in the ﬁrst half we lost our
poise and stopped playing.” said
Chipman, “They play the type of
defense that doesn’t force errors
but we threw the ball away 17
times. We weren’t concentrating.”

When the Panthers tried to
comback after falling further
behind in the second half, they got
caught into playing the Buffaloes
type of game, run and gun up and
down the court. Being forced to
play like that caused ' numerous
turnovers that led to they ﬁnal
deficit of 19,points. "

Eddie Harris led all scorers with
26 points. West Texas had "four
other players _ in double ﬁgures
which added "balance. that the
Panthers . lacked. Pitt’s leading

Scott Zettek recovered for the Irish.
However, the USC defense rose to
the occasion once again as Chip
Banks and Dennis Edwards sacked
Irish quarterback Mike Courey for
a 12 yard loss. It was on this series
that the Irish scored’ their only
three points as Harry Oliver hit on
a 30-yard field goal. '

As the third quarter ended,
Southern Cal fumbled once again
deep in its own territory. The
Irish’s Dave Duerson recovered the
ball at the Trojan 27 as the period
ended.

For the third straight time, the
Trojan defense shined as Banks
intercepted a Courey pass and took
it 49 yards to the Irish 1-yard line.
Four plays later, USC’s Eric Hipp

PHILADELPHIA — Tim Mazz-
etti’s 37-yard ﬁeld goal with seven
seconds to play gave the Atlanta
Falcons a 20-17 victory Sunday over
the Philadelphia Eagles in a battle
of playoff-bound National Football

* League teams.

Quarterback Steve Bartkowski,
who had thrown touchdown passes
of 11 yards to Wallace Francis in
the second period and 12 yards to
Lynn Cain in the third quarter,

' guided the Falcons from their own

8-yard line into ﬁeld goal range
after Atlanta took possession with
1:05 remaining.

His throws of 24 and 11 yards to
Alfred Jenkins and a defensive
against cornerback
Richard Blackmore, which wiped
out a potential game-winning
interception for the Eagles, en-

abled the Falcons to raise their
record to 11-3.

It kept the Falcons ahead of Los
Angeles in the National Conference
West. The, Eagles, losing their
second straight, fell to 11-3.

Tony Franklin tied it at 17-17
with 3:47 gone in the fourth period
with a 40-yard ﬁeld goal before

scoring for Atlanta with a 26-yard

The sport of fencing, formerly
aristocratic and now growing
rapidly in public appeal, provides
an excellent means of exercise and
Fencing is an art

swords. The ﬁrst recorded fencing
bout was held in Madinat Habu in
1190. Head and body padding was
used, showing 'that“rather"tharr a
battle or due], it was a tournament
or practice bout.
_ Due to the invention of gunpow-
der, the use of heavy armor was
discontinued, and lighter more

7  - manageable weapons became

prevalent. By the 15th century,
fencing masters had formed guilds
throughout Europe to develop the
art of swordsmanship.

Fencing was used in tourna-
ments and duels to defend honor.
In fact, until the 19thacentury when
dueling was outlawed, every man

won the bars event with a record
setting 9.65.

The Pantherette freshman was
so dominating throughout the meet
that she won every individual
event. Following the bars was the
balance beam where Shirk scored
8.8., one-tenth of a point better
than teammate Evans. To wind the
competition up, she won the ﬁoor
exercise with a 9.15‘, easily topping
Karen Martin who had a 8.35.

The Pantherettes record now
stands at 2-0. Alabama suffered
their ﬁrst defeat of the season and
now stands at 3-1. For Maryland, it
was their ﬁrst meet of the season.

This Saturday, the men and
women will have a combined meet
at the Field House. The meet will
begin at 1 p.m., followed at 7:30
when both squads will have a
mixed pairs competition.

ﬁeld goal in the ﬁrst period, broke
the deadlock.

The Eagles burst back from that
early deﬁcit with two touchdowns
in the second quarter, the ﬁrst on
Ron Jaworski’s 22-yard pass to
Harold Carmichael, the second on a
15-yard halfback option pass from
Louie Giammona to tight end John
Spagnola.

The Falcons‘ only previous
playoff appearance came in 1978
when they followed a 9-7 regular
season with a 14-13 wildcard
playoff victory over these Eagles
before losing to Dallas, Philadel-
phia‘s challenger in the NFC East
this year.

Atlanta began its comeback from
a 14-3 deﬁcit with a 60-yard,
seven-play drive ending just 21
seconds before halftime. Bartkow-
ski, who completed 13 of 33 passes
for 215 yards, found Alfred Jackson
for 22 and Francis for 24 and 16
before hitting Francis again in the
middle of the end zone, on step
beyond Blackmore.

And the Falcons, on their
possession of the third period,
drove 99 yards in nine plays with
Cain eluding linebacker Frank
LeMaster on the right side for the
ﬁnal 12 yards. The plays which put
the Falcons in business came when
Cain burst 37 yards over left tackle
from his own 3-yard line and then

At Pitt the sport of fencing
thrives. It is taught in the physical
education department by Stella
Saurer, a former Olympian.
Following the one-semester course
her class members have the option
of forming their own club to
practice and reﬁne their skills.

The veteran fencer believes that
the 15-week course is too short of a
time to determine the caliber of her
fencing students.
has been very satisﬁed with the
results of her students, as they
have excelled in local competitions.
On the possibility of avfuture
Olympian being in one of her
classes she said, “Why not, if they
have the desire to, and excel], they
could.”

Senior Steve Marzen, who has
fenced for three semesters, com-
mented that he was ﬁrst attracted
to thesport because “its chival-
rous, and has a rich heritage.”

He explained fencing to be
different than he had expected.

“It’s a lot more rigid than I

Bartkoski passed another 24 yards

After Franklin’s game-tying ﬁeld

with 9:48 to play. Philadelphia

there’s a real competitive zest and
comraderie among people who
fence.”

Good physical condition is
necessary before one fences, for
the sport requires stamina, ﬁnesse,
speed and coordination. Every
muscle in the body is used, and
must be under control. Yet despite
the intensity in a bout, the fencer is
relaxed all" the while.

Before a fencer can combat,
basic moves must be learned, as
one does not pick up a sword and
shish-kebob one’s opponent. The
footwork and positions must be
learned before one can begin to
bout. Then the lessons must be
practiced often until they become a
reﬂex action.

The equipment used to fence is
basic. It consists of a fencing
jacket; a mask; a glove; foil (or
other weapon); trousers or fencing
breeches; white stockings; and
rubber-soled gym shoes or ﬂat-
soled fencing shoes. In fencing
there are three weapons: the foil,
epee and the sabre. The foil and

gained 11 yards" to edge within
Franklin’s barefooted range, but
successive sacks of Jaworski by
linebacker Joel Williams and
defensive end Jeff Merrow pushed
the Eagles ‘back into their own
territory. '

The foil and sabre have limited
targets, and thesabre is used as a
_cutting weapon (touches are made
with the side of the blade, unlike an
epee or foil, both of which touch
with the point).

A bout lasts six minutes, and the
fencer who touches his opponent
ﬁve times wins the bout. ‘The
contestant’s weapons and body are
electrically rigged, and touches are
registered by machine. The
development of an electrical
judging apparatus was designed to
rid the competition of the uncer-
tainty of human judgment. Still,
there is a director who follows the
action and decides the validity
(whether the touch was on target)
of the blow registered by the
machine.

Saurer stated that in ‘fencing,
“there is no danger.” Even if a
blade breaks, no harm can be
incurred, providing regulation
equipment and a mask are worn at
all times.‘

Fencing is an excellent form of _

  ’CLlTENESS’ TIRES OME

IN CHRISTMAS BALLET

THE NUTCRACKER BALLET
Choreographed by Nicolas Petrov
American Dance Ensemble
Pittsburgh Playhouse

By SUSAN F. MARION

There is one word that
overwhelmed this performance: cute.
Whether that is good or bad depends
largely on who one is. If one is a child
age ten to fourteen——the healthy
majority of the audience—this
interpretation of an immortal classic
ballet probably could have thrilled
quite a bit. If one is not in this age
group ”cute" still describes it best.

, The storyline of The Nutcracker is
easily followed, expecially since a
friendly voice announces what is to
happen before each ‘act. It opens at a
Christmas party at the home of the
Burgermeister; his children Clara
and Fritz have invited all their
friends. This portion of the ballet was
largely devoted. to short,

enthusiasti'cally performed but not .

brilliantly executed dances by the
masses of children. Docile Clara was
pushed figuratively into the well-
conceived and beautiful scenery by an
over-exuberant Fritz, ‘ whose
impressively-designed but perhaps
poorly-constructed costume came
somewhat apart. »
Indeed, the story is not really
Clara's until the end of the act, when
she and the Prince dance their first pas
de deux. It is a this point that Carolyn
Paddock's simple grace" and
- remarkable characterization began

making amends for the portions of

' the ballet this interpretation chose to

edit. Her efforts were mildly foiled by
Peter Degnan as the Prince—-he is the
noisiest danseur in the company. His
steps were smooth, and inclined to be
heart-stoping (when not obviously
fumbled) as long as they remained in
the air. The ”thuds” when he landed
did little to enhance the supposedly
dreamlike quality of the pas de deux.
Although the choreography was
acceptable but not particularly
innovative, there were some
”gimmicks” that came off rather
successfully. Perhaps the best.
example was the appearance of the
life-size mice dancing through the

aisles to the stage. This surprise was .

much to the delight of the audience,
but again, insufferably ”cute”.
The most outstanding perfor-

A mance was found in a lesser role. The

Prince and Clara, enthroned, watch a
series of nationalistic dances in the
land of snow. All others were quickly

forgotten when Ginny Rotterman, as ’

an Arabian princess, treated the

audience toa display of rare talent.
After an entertaining Waltiof the

Flowers, Clara and the Prince dance

the Grand Pas de-Deux. Much as, '

Carol..yri'._’ Paddoc'k’s excellent

chairuacterizationl and style salvaged ’

the first, the unsteady and sometimes
awkward ‘movements of. Peter
Degnan triumphed, in a ridiculous
rather than moving finale.

It was not a performance to bring
you to tears—-in fact, the only thing
really worth crying about was that
there was no Sugarplum Fairy.

  

Are you one of those people who
think that Saturday Night Live was
never funny or that ABC's Fridays’ is

critic? OK, nobody's perfect, but...
If you would like a good laugh for
your weekend, maybe you ought to
see the BeanTeam this Saturday at the
Theatre Express. There you might
see future comedy stars in their f.or-

 CAPTURING THE SPIRIT OF
AMERICAN TRAGEDY: .   '
‘Death Of A Salesman’

On The Public Stage

 

 

How is genius brought to the stage? The Pittsburgh Public Theater is
currently giving a good lesson. Each night through December Zlst, the
Allegheny Square Theater will bring to life Arthur Miller's immortal
tragedy, Death of A Salesman. ‘

Somewhere between the page and the stage, the cast has found the tragic
thread that sews the work together. A feeling that cannot be seen nor
heard, it is undeniably there. .It can only be experienced. Like a sour and
sardonic knife to the lowest depths ‘of the gut, Death ofA Salesman is emotion-
ally lethal. ' ' -

At the heart of this sentimental assault is Willy Loman. Willy the
Salesman; Willy the Saint; Willy the pitiful, but enduring hero we watch
fall.- He is a terrifying piece of every one of us. That uncontrollable piece we
fear with our lives. _

And why? Because Willy has missed his boat. Standing hopelessly on an

  TheFive:i A Common Denominator Of L

In the beginning there was
the word, and the word was
punk,,3nd that made things
simple. Punks had spikey hair
an stuck safety pins in their 4
faces. The Sex Pistols were
punk, CBGB's was punk, punk
came in two basic colors: black
and white.

Since then life has grown
more complicated. Punk, the
idea, the sensibility, is more

to it. It is a strange liquid that
collects in the cracks and
fissures of our culture. What
is fascinating is the variety of
shapes it takes, forms that
defy classification: the arty
North Beach scene in San
Francisco, L.A.’s anti- '
Hollywood character, there is
even a Tex-Mex version with
Joe King Carusco in"I-Iouston,
and of course, the classic
tumult of New York and
Londonp I
Pittsburgh, for anyone who
reads the handbills pasted on
Oakland bus kiosks, has its
own home—grown ‘scene. One
group that has recently
emerged into the light of day
is The Five. .
The Five is_Dave on bass,
Reid on keyboards and vocals,

intricate than the label affixed .

of The Five’s members is like
diagramming a Victorian
novel, they have all been in
other bands, some of them in
two at one time. According to
Reid, it all began at a bar
called Phase III, and an
apartment on South Bouquet
Street. _
”People were scattered around

‘ like little campfires, and
' ‘nobody was connecting until

Phase III provided a meeting
place. Also Karl (guitarist in
Carsickness) and I had an
apartment on ‘South Bouquet.
There would bethese
spontaneous parties every
night, and every night the
cops would come. We
eventually got evicted, but it
was great,” Reid said.

This was sometime during
the winter of 1979. For
months there were jams at‘ the
parties in which anyone with
an instrument would simply
get up and play. Towards
spring, bands began to form, a
and according to Tom, the
first bar gig occurred in
March, when the Puke and

the Cuts played at the Decade.‘

Between this time until the
formation of the Dark, the
lineage gets a little murky. ‘

’Dave was playing bass with a

group called the Shutins,

Finally, when the van did

played the Electric Banana,
Western Psych (a Thanks-
giving show for the patients),
and Charlie's Ten Cent
Saloon. '

Trying to figure out "new
wave" or a group like The Five
is tricky business; it is a
phenomenon that is relatively
easy to describe, butdifficult
to explain. Their music, for
example, is full of driving
rhythms, a dominant bass and
drums, and a lot of sharp

’ punctuations, but explaining

what it is, or how it comes V

I about is another matter.

Reid: ”You can't call it spon-
taneous, that's too‘ much of ‘a
magic word. Really we have
no idea of the kind of music
we want to make, we find
what we want as we move
along.” .

Brian: "We're all into the
same kind of music, we like

the way we sound together on _

our instruments, and because
of that Ithink our music
Comes automatically.”

Reid: "Napalm Beach,’ for
example, when I first started
working on it Brian told me it
sounded like Al Dimio_la. I was
crushed."

Dave? ”Yeah, but then I -

. took.-it and dropped it down _ ,

an octave and made it a bit
more rhythmic.”

Tom: "We just tumbled
around until we hit it."

The press has come up with
avariety of names for this
sort of music, and the
attendant social scene: Punk, .

- New Wave, Techno—Pop and

infinitum. It is a way to make
things easier to deal with, but
what is really going on?

Brian: "It's got so many
different names that anybody
can hop on the wagon."

Reid: "Yeah, and Debbie
Harry, doing disco jean
commercials, is the queen of
punk, right?" '

Dave: "Basically, the whole
point was just do what you
want to do, and not to label
it." ‘

Tom: "Really it's a
resurgence oftgarage bands.”
Aestetic complaints aside,

the fact that The ‘Five has
been branded "punk" has
caused them a number of-
problems. Perhaps the most’
visible is the graphics work
they use to publicize gigs.

Reid: ”We've been using
these cut outs from an 18th
century medical text on
anatomy, that's my albatross.” I

Dave-: "Yeah, someone said-
_one ofthem was an attack on
women, the one where the
"girl was strapped up."

Reid: "I didn't even know
that it was women until I
looked close. Then I said ah-
ha, we'll put some fishnet on
her, and a little lip gloss. But
they're not mutilations, and
they're not amputations, and
we're not trying to be avant—

A garde."

_ Dave: "It's a step beyond
Duchamp. Neo-Dadaism, Post-
Pop art.” N r N t

Then there are the demo
tapes.'Recently The Five
produced recordings of I‘ 7 .
"Napalm Beach" and ’’Excite ;
Me" to distribute to local radio
stations for possible air play.
WYEP has been especially _
receptive, but Alan Spero, the
Music Director for’ WR_CT
F.M., has pulledboth songs
from the studio claiming that
they were not "fine music."

Since then, several WRCT dj's

have asked for the tapes,

particularly, ‘Gayle Eisner, b_ut

to no avail.
Probably the most direct

.

‘ effect that the "punk" label,

has is when the group tries

for a club booking. F
"I'd like to get out to the
suburbs but the problem is

with club owners, who hear

. "new wave" andthey think

O.K‘., it's a bunchof kids in-

_ skinny ties that are. going to

If you really need a label to "

ELEPHANTMAN

Directed by David Lynch
Screenplay by Christopher DeVore,
Fric Bergren and David Lynch

By JOHN RUSNAK

Bad vs. Good, a recurring theme in
monster movies is
underhandedly in this celluloid
creation. Unlike most films of its
genre, The Elephant Man is a true story
about John Merrick whose grotesque
monsterous appearance, resulting
from neurofibromatosis, is so
disgusting that he's even closed down
at circus freak shows. His beautiful
mother was struck by an African

manipulated ’

Somber ‘Elephant Man'I‘s
One OfYear’s Best   *

After the London Hospital
becomes his permanent home, John
Merrick starts leading a normal life
and, thanks to Dr. Treves, becomes
somewhat of a celebrity among
society's affluent and respectable
people, even though he is still as
loathsome as ever. A -

John Hurt’s portrayal of the title
role drains sympathy in abundance
from the viewer. The other main
characters are superbly played by 4
Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John
Gielgud. The only real problem with
the film are the character's
personalities. Too flat and
predictable, they lack complexities
and depth. «’ . '

The film is well crafted in detail and

 
 

eyed, is cheered roundlyevery time
he performs a heroic task. It's cer-
tainly not a new concept, but, under
the right conditions, as in this movie,

A it is fun.

Unlike Buster Crabbe in the origi-

verse, full of good guys and bad guys

- ter, Princess Aura (Ornella Muti), a

nymphomaniac who has other plans
for him. Flash spends the rest of the
movie dodging lasers, man-eating
creatures, and the wrath of what
seems to be everyone in the universe.
He finally leads arevolt against Ming-,
freeing all the proletariots and saving
his girl from marrying the ghoul at
the same time.

Though a broad celluloid creation
such as Flash Gordon is hardly sup-
posed to be taken seriously, there a.
few factors in the movie that weren't
taken seriously enough. For example,
with the sophistication of today's
technology, one would expect, the
movie set to look real. Instead, it
looks like a miniature scale that's
been blown up to life-size. When
Flash’s space capsule is shown chur-
tling through galaxies, one can

almost picuture some prop man hold— _

ing a three-inch long capsule on a
clear thread while a cameraman films
it. By a far stretch of the imagination,
perhaps the director and producer
wanted this movie to be as cornball as
the original, though if this is true,
they made a big mistake because
audiences today demand more.

There-are other aspects of the film
which will bother anyone over the
age of.ten, like the way characters
change clothes often, but without
our ever seeing. when or how they got
them. Forlinstance, there's a scene
where Flash crawls out of a bog
covered in slime, and __mud, only to
appear a few seconds later with clean,
dry hair. and a new set of clothes.
People. also seem to get from one
place to another quickly and with no’
obvious mode of transportation. Kids -
may not notice this sort of-‘thing,‘but
most adults will find it annoying:

While lt__l\1,e3ca31l all do fine with thér
parts, only ax Von Sydow stands
out as the ruler who makes Attila the ‘

sufferfrom low‘ I.Q.’s, especially the
film's ‘hero, whose typical lines are:

"You're crazy," "He’s apsycho," and .

”This is an insane asylum.” He deliv-
ers all these lines with zombie—like’
enthusiasm, leading us to wonder

. why he isn't at least a little surprised

to find himself off theifootball field

"minutes. He doesn't do much to dis-

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E-STREET BAND
Civic Arena »
December 1st

By SAM MATTHEWS

"If you wanna survive you better learn how to lie."

/ -The Clash

Jeff walked into "the Wooden Keg about one AM Sunday night. As he
spread his thumb and forefinger about an inch and a half wide he said, ”I
just saw Bruce Springsteen and hewas this big." That's pretty much the
story of the second show at the arena. .

I go to see Bruce Springsteen to see the guy walk on water. In‘ the past his
shows have reached epic proportions, leaving the audience elated and
drained at the end. Although his music has always dealt with somber
subjects, Bruce had always left the audience with some hope for redemp-
tion by concert end. This night redemption was not to be the case.

While watching the first set from various vantage points around the back ‘
and side of the stage, I was stunned by the opening punch of”Born to Run”
and ”Prove It All Night.” Bruce and the band looked healthy and ready for A

' the task ahead of them. Soon however a curious pattern began to develop.

Often long breaks were taken between songs and during thenewer ballads
the attention span of the audience.began to slide.

Quickly it became apparent that we were going to wade through The River

with Bruce. Songs off his first two albums were noticeably absent. On
Monday night ”For You" was done,'and the only song-off the second lp was‘  .

”Rosilita.” The majority of the 35—song set was taken fromthe lastthree
records with emphasis on The River and Darkness on the Edge of Town. High-

lights off The River were the title cut, ”I’m a Rocker" and "Point Blafnk'.”  

Bruce re-ally got it up with the two most- inspired perfor’rnan.ces""of?'th'e§—
evening on two songs he wrote but never recorded. ”Fire” and ”Because the
Night” gave Bruce the basis for an inspired performance where the rest of
the evening had just been energetic. Also, ”Because the Night” gave Bruce
the opportunity to display his guitar potential. Surprisingly Bruce played
guitar less than half the time thisconcert, and took no long solo jaunts as in

his ”Prove It All Night” past. A slight disappointment. ‘ J ,  

The E—Street band is the best back-up band touring today. Miami Steve
on guitar, and the coolest saxophonist in the history of rock and roll in
Clarence Clemmons gave the bandthe charisma needed to rise out of their

A background status. What they mafyllack in on—stage excitement they make

up in ability. The E—Street Band is the often overlooked basis for the power
of Bruces compositions. ‘

If Bruce téikes all his talk seriously about his ”pact” with his fans, Bruce let
me down. To put his audience in ahockey rink with a barely adequate PA
(up front it was loud and crystal clear but from theother side of the arena it
resembled a loud stereo), Bruce was fighting an uphill battle from the start.

Not that the concert was bad or boring. For a_ Civic Arena show..it was
one of the bes’t‘I’v‘e;ever seen. Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band
promise us more. They didn't deliver the goods. On Monday night Bruce
was barely average.’

North And South Meet

OUTLAWSIIRON CITY HOUSE-
ROCKERSIJOHNNY VAN ZANT
Civic Arena 1 5
November 28, 1980

By GEORGE HOLZER

Tofmany ‘people the day\after
Thanksgiving is a day of rest and
relaxation,_ but to the crowd in the

....Civic Arena it was the perfect day for

a Rock and Roll Feast.

Johnny Van Zant (younger brother
of Ronnie and Donnie) started his
short set of seven songs before the
arena was half full but the sparse

‘ crowd gave him a great response.

Songs like ”Hard Luck Story” and

”Only The Strong Survive” earned,

him a one song encore. yan Zant has

a good voice and the band sounded '

tuned and ready.’ I'd keep an eye on
them, they're on the way up.

Finally back home in the City of
Champions; the Iron City ‘House-
rockers were ready to show Pitts-
burgh what much of the U. S. has
already seen. The Houserockers
played eleven tunes, mixing well
between their two albums. ”Love So
Tough,” ”Ju‘nior’s ‘Bar/’ and ”Hypnot—
ized” highlighted the set, and the
encore ”Hideaway” was played‘ to

near~perfection. Joe Grushecky (lead.
vocals ‘and guitar) is a good showman
and kept most of the crowd focused
on him throughout- the show. Those
in the audience not interested in the
Houserockers should have at least,
had the consideration to listen
instead of throwing objects at Gil
Snyder (keyboards). I thought I
concert-goers had outgrown that
stage. I

At 9:30 P.M. the lights dimmed and
the stage“ now belonged to the ”Flor-
ida Guitar Army.” With heavy V
artillery in the form of Hughie
Thomasson, Billy Jones, and Freddy
Salem (sharing lead vocals and guitar)
at the front, and reinforcements by
David Dix (drums) and Rick Cua
(bass), the Outlaws blasted away at _
the receptive crowd. Standards like . 
”Stick Around For Rock and Roll,”’A— 
”Hurry Sundown,” ’’There (Goes s an
Another Love Song” and songs off‘ . "V
the latest two albums were received ’ V.
with equal enthusiasm. The Outlaws .
were brought back after doing an t 
eleven song‘ set to do a two song ,
encore of ”(Ghost) Riders In The—Sky" A 
’and, of course, ”Green Grass And 
High Tides” during which each of the) 7’|"_'5,,'i.
group got a solo spotlight. i ”‘ 

Boz: For Valium Victims’f

BOZ SCAGGS
Stanley Theatre
November 24, 1980

A By IZESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

The stage looked perfect for a Boz
Scaggs show: elegant and simple, with
geometric shapes reminiscent of the
cover photo of Down Two Then Left,
used as backdrops - and platforms.
Scaggs, too, looked as suave as ever,
from his perfectly tailored indigo jacket
and turquoise pants right down to his
white Capezio jazz shoes. The music?
Also" smooth and stylish—but that's
about all it was.

While the songs were technically near-
perfection, there was no heart or soul to
back them up. For the most part, they
were played one right after another, with
no pitter-patter between performer and
audience during the breaks. In fact,
Scaggs barely seemed to acknowledge
the audience's presence at all, delivering,
instead, a cool, calculated concert that
left one cold. Why bother to show. up in
person when the same thing could have
been heard on vinyl?

Though this consumer may not have
had a good time, others seemed content,
and even happy, to rely solely on the

. with a rose, they deserved more than ”

music for their enjoyment. While they;  
lacked warmth, Scaggs and his band.
didn't lack for talent, laying down tight
sets that matched note for note the
original album arrangements. The".
opening number, "Breakdown Dead Q
Ahead” from his latest release, Middle [_”.":
man, sounded just as good as it does on I
the album, mostly due to the two ex-.71’ 
cellent back-up vocalists Scaggs brought"  ‘
on tour with him, The majority of. the;
songs were from Silk Degrees and Midf
dle Man, including "What Can  Say?"  "
"Georgia,” "It's Over," "Lowdown," i:T;f}i
"Lido Shuffle," "Middle Man,” ”Do Like . 
You Do In New York," and "You Got 
Some Imagination.” _ ' 
Scaggs seemed so cool, one’ wondered — 
if he were really human, but this was an? ‘
swered during the first encore of”
”Lowdown,” when I noticed perspiraton H 
stains on his jacket. He may not ’’sweat :  fl
like a pig" as Roseanne Roseannadanna _ s 
would say, but it was a sure sign of life. _  
'Boz Scaggs has a lot going for him; ‘ 
he's .a talented vocalist, writer, and O 
musician with a large number of devoted  _
fans who have made him a very rich 
man. Like the young woman who , ;
walked up onstage to present‘ Scaggs V;

GREATEST HITS/LIVE
Heart
Epic

The new double album by Heart
reminds me of a salad. If I can pick
out the radishes, I love it. There
are a few radishes in this collection

that should have been left out.

What remains will more than
satisfy any Heart fan.

Sides one and two are digital
reproductions of old favorites like

Heart

T AL'B’Ul\/IS

are filled out with some of the.

. horns from Tower of Power.

Overall, it's a worthwhile collec-
tion that displays the range of
Heart's ability, from sweet to
raucous. So, if you don't mind a
few radishes, this is one great
salad.

Music with Heart.

WENDY WAREHAM

. . a worthwhile collection displays the range of Heart's ability.

"Crazy On You,” "Dog and Butter-

fly” and "Straight On.” These
selections, nine in all, lose none of
their original quality in reproduc-

gtion. They represent some of

Heart's finest efforts from
Dreamboat Annie to Bebe le
Strange. ‘
Sides three and four feature
seven live selections and two
previously unreleased radishes.
' ”Hit Single” is a collage of con-'
versation, singing and laughing all
turned into an electronic night-
mare. "Strange Euphoria" is a

. "Heart-less" gag.

The live selections include some
of their'own greats like "Bebe le
Strange," title track from their
preceding album, as well as rendi-
tions of songs by Little Richard,
Lennon and McCartney, Led Zep-
plin and The Righteous Brothers.

THE ROMANTICS
National Breakout

Nemperor

Back in Ianuary, a new wave
group from Detroit called The
Romantics released an album of
the same name. The album had
all sorts of irresistible hooks, cat-
chy lyrics, and a great song on it
called "What I Like About You,"
that seemed to find its place on the
cockles of everyone’s lips and
heart._ The album and the single
sold really well, and the band
played some really hot gigs, but all
sorts of nasty people with really
serious faces and really boring lives
said that The Romantics were just
lucky the first time around and
that like the entire premise of new
wave, The Romantics would only
last a few months.

Well, a year is up, the Roman-
tics’ have just released their second
album, entitled National Breakout,
and after listening to it I'm glad I
listened to what my mother said
serious, boring

Compositions like "India/’

have one common element, a

hypnotic appeal of a Hare Krishna

is that the lyrics of Butler are

A The new Romantics album is an
excellent second effort from those.

album without riding on the coat-

familiar Romantics’ sound on an
impressive second run. _

Although there are no obvious

STAGE STRUCK

' I would be better able‘ to write
about this album if I-heard it more '
than once. But with Gallagher live,

Li

S" ‘ this is quite impossible. With each

listening, it changes’ drastically.
Like, a ‘black hole of blues guitar,
"every chord, every melody shifts
into new, undetectable .-patterns.

4 The dimensions are infinite. So

what does this leave us? _
This fluctuant, almost fickle
quality gives it equal merits and
equal pitfalls. ‘
' It is almost like having an end- \
less supply of albums, every time "35
the needle crosses back to the first
cut. The dimensions are simply in-
-finite. The energy is unchecked,

' and -the dynamics, of the_ live

recording are a pleasant assault; '

But there is also some degree of
insecurity with this album. Un-
tagged} unchained, uncategorized,
it is like having a yoyo in your
record collection. And it is subject
to mood swings. ' ‘ ‘

But none the less, the guitar ef-
fort exploding from Mr. "Gallagher '
is more than commendable; com-
prehensively, Stage Struck is a

-celebration of his best work. But I
watch out. You may never play the " Q
