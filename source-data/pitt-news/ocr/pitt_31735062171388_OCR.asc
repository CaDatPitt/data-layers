Local Option Wins By A Landslide

Dorm Students Polled

\

,3

A referendum was recently
voted on within the University
residence halls concerning the
local option for determining visit-
ation hours in the residence halls.
The results of the vote which took
place on Oct. 7 and 8 area as fol-
lows: 1. Of the 3.447 students
eligible to vote. 2.624 (76 per
cent) did vote. 2. -Of those who
voted. 2.432 (93 per cent) were in
favor of the local option and
192‘ (seven per cent were not in
favor.

The outcome showed that the
majority of resident students fav-
or a local option with 24 hours
maximum visitation time. The

proposal gives each resident hall
living unit the option to practice
self government in deciding what
their own visitation hours will be
on an annual basis.

This privilege is not uncom-
mon in Pennsylvania. Penn
State's dormitories votes each
term for their own visitation stan-
dards. At Temple University. last
year they received approval for a
local option proposal for visita-
tion on a 24 hour a day. seven
days a week basis.

The University of Pennsylvania
permits its upperclassmen who
live in apartments within coedu-

cational buildings to have no visit-
ation restrictions. Freshmen liv-
ing in different dormitories vote
upon their own visiting hours af-
ter six weeks.

The referendum has been en-
dorsed by WHB, MHB. the Assis-
tant Director of Housing Will Mill-
er and the University housing
staff. The Social Committee will
review the referendum on Thurs-
day. Oct. 23. '

Until then. the current visita-
tion restrictions will be in effect
and be dependent upon the out-
come of the Social Committee's
decision.

Homecoming Wrap-Up

Homecoming 1970 began on a
melodic note Thursday evening
with Judy Collins" captivating per-
formance at the Syria Mosque.

In addition to her own numbers.
Miss Collins sang songs written

by Leonard Cohen, Joan Baez.

Joni Mitchel. Bob Dyland and Ian
Tyson. A particularly moving mo-
ment occurred when she dedi-
cated one of Joan Baez‘ songs to
Miss Baez' "husband. David Har-
ris. who is currently serving a

prison sentence "for choosing life '

over death.“ as Miss Collin‘s put
it.

A few individuals in the near-
capacity crowd were moved to the
point of tears as large portions of
the students saluted Miss Collins
with a cheering. standing ovation.

Homecoming activities contin-
ued successfully Saturday after-
noon with Pitt squeezing past

propelling the team to the presti-
gious position of number one in

‘Saturday evening activities of-
fered the students a choice among

tion by the New Feminist Reper-
tory Theatre.

The New Feminist Theatre. led
by Anselma dell'0lio. presented
an informal version of a musical
production planned for the off-
Broadway stage. Although por-
tions of the presentation were
crude. its theme of portraying
women as the oppressed. under-
privileged majority was clearly
transmitted.

One short play. The Servant
Girl and the Lady, by Myrna
Lamb. came across as the final
statement of getting the oppres-

Second Bomb Threat 

  Causes Evacuation

 

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

A bomb threat. the University’s second in less than a monthl,lel;:‘;:1l- ‘ 
ptied Alumni Hall Friday morning. - T

Following a 30 minute search of the building, University police
declared the building safe for occupany. According to Robert Merritt,
superintendent of the Campus Security Department, no bomb was found. 7
nor were any of the important files and chemicals stored in Alumni Hall_ ~,f

 

An anonymous caller phoned the University police at about  
a.m. saying that a bomb was set to explode in Alumni Hall at 11 a..r_r1.
Working quickly. the police were able to evacuate before 11 the 150 peo-
ple who were in the building. ' ’

After the building was cleared, six campus policemen conducted a 
half hour search for the bomb. When none was found, the building was-
opened and normal activities resumed.

A similar hoax occurred Sept. 28 when the Hill Library was‘, '
cleared after an anonymous tlpster called in a bomb threat. At that ~ :
time. also. no explosive was discovered. " ’ ~

In both instances. the caller was male and told only the location of ._
the bogus bomb and the time it was to have exploded. Though the _.
threats were alike. Merritt didn't speculate as to whether they were; *
issued by the same person. '

"The first call." he said. “went directly to the library. We nevleril if V
heard the person's voice.“ i .

New Contest Proposed

by ELLIOTT GILL

As a counterpart to the annual
Ugly Man on Campus Contest.
several individuals here at Pitt
are in the process of organizing a
Stacked Broad on Campus Con-
test! ! I

The organizers of this contest
—Arnie Steinberg, Ray Williams
and Frank Sharpless, hope to
make it into a first-term tradi-

 
 

 

tion. The purpose of the event will -

be to raise money for charity. If

approved. it will be held in early
_ November and will be followed
:4, by a victory dance. tentatively
E scheduled for Nov. 14. The con-
test will probably be held in con-
junction with a major campus or-
ganization.

The contest, itself, will be run
along the lines of the Ugly Man
on Campus Contest, with students
voting by putting money in con-
tainers located beneath the pic-

 

 

The young ladies who enter will
have side-view pictures taken of

. them (probably from the neck
down, and, of course, fully cloth-

Sexuality Discussions

by SUE IIOENSTINE

With a copy of Human Sexual
Response (the landmark volume
by Masters and Johnson). a set of
slides. and what they hope are dis-
cussion-provoking facts on sex.
members of the Sexual Informa-
tion Forum have organized to
present what they feel is a healthy
approach to sexuality.

Last year Dr. Ronald Chez. as-
sociate dean of the School of Med-
icine, organized the Forum with a
group of 16 medical students.
Chez had been unable to answer
all of the questions the public
brought to him concerning sex. so
he and his students prepared a
pair of lectures and began pre-
senting them to interested groups.

“The first lecture emphasizes
more than just the physical as-
pects of sexual compatability,”
explained Eileen Tryala, one of
the Forum’s members. It includes
information concerning the psy-
chological components that must
be present for a sexual relation-
ships.” The Masters and Johnson
text on Human Sexual Response
is one of the major sources for
lecture one.

After the lecture and some
slides that also deal with anatomi-
cal and physiological responses
during sexual intercourse, the
medical students try to initiate
discussions with the audience.
Miss Tyrala pointed out that the
success of the discussions de-
pends on the audience's response.
and in the past. most of the dis-
cussions have begun with ques-
tions concerning sexual problems

How conception comes about.

different methods of contracep-
tion. and abortion are the basic
topics of the second lecture. Em-
phasis is placed on the reliability

of different methods of birth con- .

trol and family planning. Abortion
is explained from a technical
standpoint. but the group has re-
ferred questions concerning ther-
apeutic abortions to other agen-
cies.

The members of the Sexual In-
formation Forum have tried to
avoid presenting moralistic judg-
ments on sex. Though homosex-
uality and questions on extramar-
ital sex have been brought up dur-
ing some discussions, Miss Ty-
rala said that most past discus-
sions deal with sexual. problems
of marital circumstances.

Forum at 683-1620 to arrange the

ACLU Head Discusses Repression

"Fact or Fantasy”

by ELLEN GANLEY

Tom Kerr. chairman of the
Pittsburgh Civil Liberties Union.
spoke Friday night at the Crumb-
ling Wall Coffee House. The topic
of his speech was Repression:
Fact or Fantasy.

Kerr opened his speech by say-
ing. ‘'1 think we'll have more fun
if we talked back and forth" and
invited comments at any time dur-
ing the speech.

The first example that Kerr ci-
te as repression was the press‘
lack of total coverage of govern-
mental issues. Last week. he said.
the two major Pittsburgh newspa-
pers mentioned that President
Nixon had signed a new crime bill.
Kerr pointed out that “a new
crime bill” really isn‘t very ex-
plicit.

He went on to explain that the
bill provides that‘(l) the FBI can
go on any campus that is given
federal funds, without an invita-
tion, to investigate a homing (2)
bombing in which someone is kill-
ed are now punishable by death,
and (3) a national commission be
set up to investiage violations of
individual rights by state or local
governments.

Kerr also stated that Presi-
dent Nixon signed a bill that pro-
vides federal public defenders for
people involved in federal cases
that cannot get their own lawyers.
Concerning Nixon's signing of this
bill, Kerr stated that “I don‘t
know how he happened to sign it.
It must have just slipped through.“

A new Pennsylvania law was
Kerr‘s next target. He asserted
that the state’s ruling that col-
leges and universities, must re-
port all students who are involved
in political demonstrations is "re-
pressive“ and is an “invasion of
the student's privacy and the pri-
vacy of the institution."

Kerr went on to say that this
law is presently being tested in
the courts. The case involved Hav-
erford College and Goddard Col-
lege, a New England institution

that has Pennsylvania students.

He cited the police as nother
repressive agency. One reason he
believes police are repressive is
that they stereotype such groups
as blacks and young people. He
said that police believe Negroes
are "lazy. on welfare. don't have
lawyers. can be put down. and the
police do put them down." To-
wards youth. Kerr said that most
police can't get past the hair and
clothes and aren't "interested in
the good things that young people
are going for."

"Police are becoming politi-
cal." he asserted. As examples of
this. he noted that during the Mor-
atorium the Pittsburgh Police had
flags on their squad cars and pa-
trolled with their lights on, both.
according to Kerr. were signs of
their opposition to the Moratori-
um.

As another example of police
becoming political, Kerr said that
last week police in a Pittsburgh
squad car were going all over
Squirrel Hill putting up posters
for a candidate for the Pennsyl-
vania legislature.

At this point in the program.
Kerr was accused of stereotyping
police and putting himself on the
same level he was putting the po-
lice. Kerr responded saying that
police were public servants and
should work for the whole com-
munity during the eight hours
they're on the job.

Another member of the audi-
ence noted that “'a doctor does not
have the right to react. a lawyer
does not have the right to react.
I‘m an actor and I don’t have the
right to react on the state. Police
have eight hours a day to be police
and 16 hours to react politically."

When asked “What do we do in
the meantime," concerning po-
lice oppression. he said. "I think
more people should sue the police.
Suing them doesn‘t hurt them fi-
nancially because they’re cover-
ed by insurance. the Fraternal
Order of Police isn‘t hurt. and you
may even win the case." But Kerr
stated that “policemen hate to be
sued."

”i‘epage 4--THE PITT 1<I—Ews—lwonday, octpber iii, 19770"

A group of "students are trying to organize the University what
,-they claim is an alternative to the annual “Ugly Man on Campus
 1' Contest,” called “Stacked Broads on Campus." It seems that we
«-‘jsfhave been through this whole question before with the recent edi-
, " torial on the Homecoming Queen contest, but this new idea is even
‘ 1* more evil in concept than that one could possibly be.

e ’ Just think of it, we are going to get to vote for women students
 who have, what our society has determined as “great bodies.“ Of
3 '5-course, you women who are just the smallest bit under or over-
 : weight won’t be included, but that isn‘t.even the question now.

_ ‘V ‘This contest is one of the most immoral ideas ever to come out
I H " of student minds. The Pitt News is ashamed that such a thing could
, L "if even come from the University of Pittsburgh student community.

mi  1It‘is understandable that men are patterned and trained from
C  the time they can notice differences between males and females to
-  view them» as sex objects, men feel good, but these are unfair inhu-
 .[ ‘frnan concepts and must be discounted.

; _ ' A women would submit to having her picture maligned as the

7 'o'rgani.zers of the mockery wish to do, must be terribly unintellig-
 gen and insecure if all she wants to be recognized for is the jut of her
, ‘ breasts, slope of her behind, or curvature and looks of her legs.

, ,. ‘-T;he,Ugly Man on Campus contest is a completely different idea
 this new one. If the men were chosen by their actual looks in
 the UMOC contest at least some sort of demented rational could be
_- ,, ‘seen. for the SBDC thing, but it isn't. UMOC winners are chosen by
I : the.bestmake-up job done.

_ _. _ There remains no possible rational for the SBOC contest, ex-
~ Jcept that, which lies in the minds of the organizers of the event, who
..'*.f:.'refuse to see women as people—as human beings, but animals,
‘ whose bodies can be used for anything.

_ e _ Not even the fact that the money generated by the event will go
j; ‘ to.some' worthwhile charity excuses its conception. I'm sure there
‘ -isa better, more moral way to do so.

 , The organizers stated to the editor of The Pitt News that they
7;  I-1a_vey.talked to certain University administrators who are recep-
 ﬂtive to the idea, who in fact like it. We can only say that The Pitt
3  News would condemn any administrator or organization that en-
able such an event as this to become a reality.

? I O ' We ask the organizers to really take a deep inner look into the
"  _,hearts and minds and ask is this a moral thing they are trying to
j b establish.

I5 "prove-the contest, but if by some quirk of sicknature it did become
 aiworking reality, everyone on campus would boycott it anyway;
‘ ‘ wouldn’t we?

.. . f .  The SBOC contest idea would make a mockery of some of the
.. (stated policies of the University of Pittsburgh. It is an insult to ev-
;_ery thinking person on this campus, and we are embarrased that the

need for an editorial on such an idea is.e..ven necessary.

"As long as people who knew Snork live on, his name will enjoy
7_ immortality. Because no one can believe that he’s for real.

Snork was a pusher (the past tense is appropriate because he
now earns his living as a policeman). He also functioned as an area
dealer. The difference means that Snork was big time on the cam-
" pus drug scene.

v There was no one that called him friend. He was too elusive.
One day he would just drop in. passing around his speed freakness to
" those who knew him; the next. he would call from New York. in the
city. to pick up a delivery.
HSNORK WAS somewhere between the cops and the Mafia. He
could entertain for hours with horror tales about being chased by
dog-armed narcs in Schenley Park or “gun happy“ Mafiosos on the
’ Hill.
V I I was never sure whether I should believe his stories or not. But
the day he borrowed my half-fare card to make a trip (the literal
.  kind), I was swayed.

Snork was never quite there when he spoke. His eyes were con-

ﬁstantly glazed, their silvery blueness betraying sleepness mara-

fthons. His arms were free of the staccato disfigurations that his
clients suffered. But it was difficult not to like him.

= T‘ I I_IE’D ASK YOU “How ya doin" five to. ten times in one conver-
., sation, always apologizing with “I just can‘t get it together.“ If you

knew Snork well enough to be privy to his telephone number (a great
I privilege), he’d supply you with free dope upon request.

Snork has walked into innumberable busts. but he was some-
how always clean. He never had so much as a teaspoon on him.

But Snork had a few aces up his sleeve and that explains things
~ a bit. “Like the cops from the precinct used to come over to his place
, to get stoned after work." “Like one of his relatives was a big time
cop.” And, like, he had some money. I

ONE DAY SNORK cracked up. The organized were on his back
‘ and he wasn’t sure how long he could play the game and get away
with it. Other businessmen were setting up routes and the competi-
tion. was tougher than it had ever been. His studies were falling back.

Snork reformed himself—in an incredibly conventional sani-
’ tarium way. He claims that he's "gotten out of it." But some who
knew him well are dubious. The same way that nobody believes that
« the ex-con has gone straight. , V .

other things that he’s been..IIe not a narc ("I couldn't make that

It is a well known fact that during World War
II women fulfilled many of the jobs left vacant by
men. Leaving their "place" in the home. women
kept the domestic front functioning by joining the
industrial labor force. When the war ended. the
men came back and resumed their jobs.

At this time. the mass media initiated an inten-
sive propaganda campaign glorifying the woman
as housekeeper. mother and sex object. The intent
was to solve the problem of surplus labor by elim-
inating women from the paid labor force. Once
again the woman‘s place was in the home.

ropolitan newspapers is indicative of the stifling
role orientations established. Women's interest
are dictated to be fashion. weddings and gossip.

Women are not expected to think about politics.
vocations or anything beyond how “to catch a
man." ' ’ '

Women are to be passive and act as a stabiliz-
er to her man after he is reduced by alienating
work and unquestioning acceptance of authority
at his place of labor.

Women are the lowest paid workers. Black
women are lowest paid of all. Women are channel-
ed into secretarial. clerical. nursing. and teaching
occupations.

Secondary schools provide mechanical trades
for boys and home economics for girls. Little
girls play house and mother while the little boys
play with guns and doctor kits.

The Presidential Commission on Campus Un-

Theevi,d,ence for this claim is based on empirical
findings (i.e. interviews withstudents. etc. I.

Donatelli. in a column in (The Pitt News). Oct.
12. however. feels that the new cultures views
on the Indochina war are so "foolish" that ideal-
ism alone cannot account for them.

Of course. the new culture's
views on the Indochina war have
been held by such well-known
tools as Bertrand Russell. one
of the greatest philosophers and
mathematicians of the 20th
century.

I acknowledge that I do not
find it surprising that Donatel— -
li's appraisal of the U.S. involve- ‘ ‘
ment in Vietnam differs from
that of Russell. whose life's works involved clear
reasoning (philosophy and mathematics l.

Donatelli gives an alternative explanation of
campus unrest. He quotes Professor John Green-
way: “The underlying cause of student rebellion
is simply the biologically imperative fact that hu-
mans beings. like all successful species. are as
as bad as they are allowed to be.“

It is immediately obvious thatthe cause of
campus unrest is a scientific question and scien-
tists do not decide their questions by sitting back
in an armchair and just thinking about what the
causes are.

EMPIRICALLY PROVEN
The Commission on Campus Unrest conducted

such an empirical study and if Donatelli disagrees
with it he should offer alternative empirical find-

Media commercialism

Attempting To Stymie
Women’s Liberation Move

The cultural conditioning and channeling of
women is a necessary function in this country.

THE FAMILY
The nuclear family is a functional structure of
capitalism. If housewives moved en masse out of
the home and desired a place in the industrial la-
bor force. chaos would ensue.

The inability of capitalism to provide steady
employment under existing circumstances has
pushed unemployment up near the six per cent
mark. The myth of male supremacy is therefore
necessary to the maintenance of the economic sys-
tem.

Women have democratic rights to: free abor-

tion on demand. 24 hour day care centers which‘
would allow women the right to work plus the op- '

portunity to occasionally relax. equal pay for
equal work and financial compensation for the free
labor they provide in the home.

Men should equally share in child care. house-
work. cooking and "women’s work."

Men should begin to search their conscious-
ness -for supremacist attidues toward women. re-
flected in terms such as broad or chick.

The Women's Liberation struggle is part of the
struggle for human liberation. At present the mass
media is attempting to commercialize its impor-
tance out of existence.

President Nixon asked male construction
workers in Chicago. “How would you like to wake
up in the morning next to a pipe fitter?"

A fitting statement from a man who has shown_
no respect for humanity anywhere outside his rul-
ing clique and its allies.

is supported by extensive scientific studies (in
which case. I expect Donatelli to publish .the
names alongwith the revelant information about
the research teams in The Pitt News, or the “bio-

_ logical imperative fact" is not supported by sci-

entificxfindings (in which case it represents Dona-
telli's non—empirical solution to an empirical ques-
tionl.

If Donatelli cannot produce the empirical sup-
port. then I must conclude that his article is a piece
of biased trash—an obvious case of a person's
idealogical bias influencing his selection of facts.

AGNEW . . . . .

The Commission report also includes an obvi-
ous reference to Agnew. where it asks the public
officials to calm their rhetoric. The implicit pre-
mise is that Agnew's rhetoric is a cause of cam-
pus unrest.

Donatelli claims that this implicit premise
does not stand up under analysis. His claim is that
campus unrest existed before Agnew became
Vice-President. therefore. Agnew's rhetoric is not
a cause of campus unrest.

The fallacy is obvious. Just because campus
unrest previously existed does not mean that Ag-
new's rhetoric does not contribute to campus un-
rest now.

By parity of reasoning (using Donatelli's argu-
ment) one could argue as follows: "Just because
stupidity existed before the founding of YAF. it is
not true that YAF contributes to the present stup-
idity that exists" which is surely invalid (elemen-
tary logic. Donatelli ).

Thus. just as Donatelli falsely claimed that the
campus unrest report analysis does not hold up un-
der analysis. his own analysis does not hold up un-
der analysis.

Reader Sees 
Panther Upset

(Editor's Note: This letter was re-
ceived in The Pitt News office last
week. It was held up to see if Mr.
Zonis’ satiric predictions would in-
deed come throughp originally
written as somewhat of a joke to
sports editor Ed Conley, it comes
through with sparkling reality in
light of the Saturday game.)

To the Editor. The Pitt News:

Throughout the 1970 Pitt foot-
ball—season I have spent many
hours observing the Pitt News
sports editor. Ed Conley. On
many occasions I have question-
ed his competency in such an im-
portant position. but after reading
“Enough to Win" in last Mondays
Pitt News my mind is made up.

As sports editor. Mr. Conley
should be extra sensitive to the
inner workings of a football coach-
es‘ mind. He obviously is not.
Carl DePasqua is involved in a

. ‘ unique plot aimed at beating WVU

and Ed Conley is completely un-
aware ofit!

Mr. Conley states that we have
been "ragged." that we "prob-
ably couldn‘t beat anyone on our
schedule if we keep playing the
way we have played in our last
three games.“ He cites the fact
that we dropped ten points behind
Baylor. let KSU stay even with us
for three quarters and barely
squeaked by Navy. tDon‘t you see
Ed. it is all part of the plot!)

It is really very simple. Carl
DePasqua discovered in the
UCLA game that with a little work
we could beat anyone on our
schedule. But he also knew that
our next three games were
"cake." Carl said. “Why slaught-

er Baylor. KSU and Nayy—let's ‘

 

CONTINUING

True revolution isn't

On powerful God-
derived ideas that heal
social and personal
wrongs.

Harold Rogers, a
Christian Science

how these ideas can

tionary changes for
good in your life and
the world.

Come hear him share
some of these ideas in

just beat them by the smallest of
margins so no one will know just
how good we really are. Then.
come WVU we open it up and beat
the 11th ranked team in the coun-
try by seven touchdowns.“
Of course. Carl is smart. tie
knew that if all his starters were
in that it would look like a fix. so
he had them get “injured." He
sent in a special play in the Navy
game where the fullback laterals
back to thequarterback and the
quarterback gets creamed. He
put glue on the bottom of Ralph
iCindrich's shoes for the UCLA
game so he would get too much
traction but be hurt only until we
really need him. And. of course.
he finally unleased the tremen-
dous toe of Joe Spicko (who can
secretly kick 70 yard field goals
leap tall buildings at a single
bound) against Navy when the
chips were down. It is all part of
the plot. Ed. so be ready for the
big win over WVU and buy
your Orange Bowk tickets right
now.

But most of all. keep your eyes
open. It is your job to discover
these plots—that is what you call
a scoop!

The Editor. The Pitt News:

Rita Cunninghsms observa-
tions of the “Helptles Fetus“
«Pitt News, Oct. 9) offers a re-

freshing thought and insight in

this age of languishing hopes and
all the perverse rationality which
stupefies the mind today.

Man has emerged from the
backwaters of mediaevalism.
shorn of the shackels of his ignor-
ance. on a new horizon. bright
with the promise. the challenge.
the liberation. and the hope of full-
fillment through science and tech-
nology.

No one would deny the contri-

butions of these to human society.
For the burgeoning populations of
the world. science. or rather the
benefits accrued from it. spells
the only hope for its survival and
development.

But the polemic's over-ration-j

ality and view of life as a mere
fortuitous juxtaposition of cells
has strangely distorted many of
mans perspectives and chal-
lenged his most sacred beliefs.

To me. Miss Cunninghams
views. in a microcosm. reflect the
particular tragedy and irony of
our age. Perhaps as never before
in the long trail of evolution. and
the evolution of human thought.
does man need to redefine for
himself his role in this world.

Let not ignorance about him-
self and his fellow-man be his
greatest undoing. We talk so
passionatelyabouthumanizing
the system. let us begin by hu-
manizing ourselves.

Nearly 20,000,000 people participated in
Earth Day.

But what did they accomplish?-

President Nixon proclaimed Boat Week
and Archery Week.

Politicians came out in favor of clean air,
clean water and apple pie.

Corporations said, “We haven’t. found the
answer to pollution yet. But we’re working
on it.” ’

And the vast majority of Americans drove
to work in their own fumes, ate their daily
chemicals and pesticides, discarded millions
of tons of junk and wondered why the earth
was in such bad shape.

It seems like everybody wants somebody
else to do something about pollution.

And it looks like that somebody else is us.

Environmental Action, a coalition of
about 4,000 environmental and conserva-
tion groups throughout the country.

We planned Earth Day. We organized it.

And, despite the largest, cleanest and

, . most peaceful demonstration in America’s
history, we can’t afford to call Earth Day a
success.

Pollution. Overpopulation. Overkill. Slums.

What we need now is not more Earth

Environmental Action needs money to in-

agencies that may be causing pollution.

We need money to press for effective leg-

We need money to instigate lawsuits

We need money to create a permanent en-

28 Point EX

Erases WVU’s

by JERRY MYERS

In an unprecedented comeback. the Pitt Panthers shellshocked the
West Virginia Mountaineers before 44.479 screaming fans at Pitt Sta-

dium Saturday. 36-35.

Erasing a 27-point (35-8) Mountaineer lead. which was re-
corded in the first half by a fired-up WVU squad. the Panthers explod-
ed for four big touchdowns in the last 30 minutes of play to cap what
Coach Carl DePasqua calls "the most fantastic comeback I’ve ever ex-
perienced in my 17 years of coaching."

With Dave Havern at the helm. the Panthers grinded out 259 yards
on the ground complimenting Havern's l1—for—16 passing day. Many
of those passes pulled the Panthers out of third-and-long yardage sit-

uations. and Havern’s final com-
pletion was the five-yard pass to
Bill Pilconis that put the Panthers
aheadwith only 55 seconds left in

, _ the game.

As effective as the offense was,
the defense was the squad of the
day. Holding the Mountaineers to
a total of 15 plays in the second
half, allowing the offense to grind

more than West Virginia had the
entire game.

Summing up the difference be-
tween the two halves def‘ensively.
George «Feher. big middle—line-
backer who replaced Ralph Cind-
ricli earl_v in the second quarter
said. “Everyone took turns mak-

' ing individual mistakes in the first

half. In the second half we put it
all together."

The Panthers. now 4-1 on the
season. looked like anything but
winners for the entire first half.
West Virginia moved the ball at
will against them. piling 351 net
yards rushing and five touch-
downs. Ed Williams (106 yards
rushing in the first half» and Bob
Gresham (135 yards first half)
kept the Panthers on the run. Ex-
ploding for long gainer after long
gainer the Mountaineers appear-
ed unstopable.

With Sherwood directing traf-
fic, the Mountaineers cashed in on
Pitt paydirt four times on the
ground and once in the air. Ed
Williams scored on two-yard and
one-yard dives followed by Gres-
ham’s one yard skip less than
three minutes later.

Then with 29 seconds left in
the half. Sherwood passed to tight
end Jim Braxton who sprinted
down the middle for WVU's fifth
and final TD of the day.

Havern followed with a two—point
conversion run.

Ferris was later named the
games outstanding player by the
press. only two votes ahead of
Havern in the tallying. Havern
was given the game ball by the
players. - I

The second half belonged to the
Panthers. Roaring back in what
fullback Tony Esposito calls “the
best team effort I have ever seen
in my life," the Cats proceeded to
do just what Duke did to the Moun-
taineers one week ago. they ram-
med the ball down WVL"s throat.

Engineering four straight sus-
tained touchdown drives. the Pan-‘
thers scored every time they had
the ball in the second half. The
Cats took the opening kick-off of
the half and drove 58 yards in 14
plays. culminating with a Denny
Ferris touchdown. Ferris fought
for 144 yards rushing in the con-
test.

I)ePasqua managed to rotate
his backs‘ to perfection. allowing
Dave Garnett to get a chance to
show his ability. Garnett charged
through the Mountaineer line for
81 yards. many of which came on
tough third down situations.

The team effort rolled on like
a big machine with Tony Esposito
bouncing back from a very sub-
par first half to roll up 48 tough
yards on the ground. Dave Havern
picked out selected receivers on
big yardage, third down situations
to keep the drives moving, while
Ferris, Sgrignoli, Garnett and Es-
posito picked apart the Moun-
taineer defense.

A last desperation move by the
Mountaineers was putting their

The constant Panther success
on third down plays and the simi-
lar success on fourth down plays
after the third down plays failed
during the second half of the Pitt-
WVU game was a big reason for
the Pitt comeback: the key third

The Panthers final drive ate up
over eight minutes of the fourth-
quarter and characterized the Pitt
strategy that prevailed for the en-
tire half. When WVU finally did
retain possession with 55 seconds
left. their drive was doused when
John Stevens recovered a fum-
ble by Mountaineer Wayne Porter
on the Pitt 36 and one play later
the Cats had their fourth victory
of the year and the fourth in a row.

There wasn‘t much that Coach
DePasqua could say during a pan-

Panther Fans Come

by MARTY HELLMAN

During a break in the halftime
activities. a Pitt fan rose in the
student section and played
“Taps“ on his trumpet. signify-
ing the supposed end of the Pan-
ther football team. after West
Virginia took a 35-8 lead.

His feelings were shared by a
majority of the near capacity
crowd on hand. Remarks such as
“were going to ‘get killed" and
"Boy. is West Virginia good."
could be heard in the conversa-
tions of the Pitt gridiron fans at
halftime.

WVU’s Eddie Williams (42) scored
three first half TDs, as Panther fans
moaned.

Steadily throughout the disas-
trous first half. the enthusiasm of
the Pitt students went slowly
downhill. A barometer of the spir-
it in the crowd was the tinkling of
the bells that many of the students
had as a result of gifts by the
cheerleaders.

After the opening kickoff, the
only timethat the bells rang out
loud was when Denny Ferris scor-
ed in the second period to cut the
WVU lead to two touchdowns. In
the rest of the half, the bells tink-
led faintly.

When the teams returned to
start the second half. the West
Virginia rooting sections cheered
wildly as their "conquering he-
roes" ran by.

Conversely. the Panthers en-
tered the Stadium to notice that
their supporters were apparently
more interested in the outcome of
the Homecoming Queen contest.

As the second half got under-
way with WVU’s Jim Braxton
kicking off,
afraid that the slaughter would
continue.

Gradually. the spirit reversed
itself. Even after the offense
.grinded its way to its first of four
second-half TD's. the fans were
unsure.

Everyone was either thinking
or saying. “Big deal. we scored
one time but now they'll get the
ball and score again.“

Pitt football dreams of supre-
macy in the East appeared doom-
ed Saturday as West Virginia
mounted a 35-8 halftime lead over
the Panthers in the Homcoming
game at Pitt Stadium.

But something happened. The
Panthers turned the game around
in the second half. constr_ucting
four precision drives down the
gridiron for 28 points and an as-
tonishing 36-35 triumph.

The Panthers could be the num-
ber one team in the East‘s Lam-

 

everyone seemed I

Not until the defense held the
previously-exploding Mountain-
eer offense did the ringing of the
bells and the screaming of ‘the
fans begin in earnest.

“Hey, maybe we still have a
chance to win,” was the thought
that started to move throughout
the students’ minds.

As the team continued on with
its superlative second half come-
back. the students responded with
their own “comeback.“

The tinkling of the bells became
a crescendo of noise. and those
without noisemakers cheered
louder than ever before.

Each vital play and each new
first down brought the throng to
its feet. For the first ime in
awhile, a Pitt student section had
something to really cheer about.

By the end of the game. pande-
monium reigned throughout the
stands on the Pitt side. People
were hugging and kissing each
other. and a chant of "Were Num-
ber One! “ echoed for several min-
utes.

Just as the Panther football
team had united to play one of the
most perfect halves of football
ever witnessed. so did the stu-
dents unite together to cheer in
perfect unison.

At the end of the first half. ev-
eryone was saying “were dead.“
By the end of the game. the tune
had changed to “I can‘t believe we
won. Ijust can‘t believe it."

bert Trophy voting this week if
the win and their 4-1 record is
considered more impressive than
Ivy Leaguer Dartmouth's unde-
feated mark. Dartmouth was
ranked second last week and the
Panthers were third. behind the

What did Pitt head coach Carl
DePasqua say to his players at
halftime which could produce the
overwhelming response on the
football field?

“I think that‘s insignificant.“
the coach said after the game.

had done. “In today‘s football that

doesn't have any factor on the out-
come."

DePasqua didn't want to talk
about the technicalities of foot-
ball after the victory. and no one
else in the jammed Pitt locker
room wanted to. either.

Why the comeback?

Most. of the answers were sum-
med up-by Lloyd Weston.

"We wanted to win.“ the Pan-
ther tackle said. "We wanted to
be number one in the East."

Dave Garnett, Panther half-
back who saw the most action he
has seen all season and scored a
key touchdown along with gaining
important first downs, thought the
Cats really began to think victory
a little later than the halftime in

_the locker room.

A.

"After the first touchdown." he
said. “No the second touchdown-
it was the first touchdown in the
second half—the guys realized we
could move the ball."

“But I really think it was the
defenses game in the second half.
They stopped them (WVU)." he
added. reminding that without the
play of the Panther defense those
time consuming TD marches
couldn‘t have happened.

Most observers in the Stadium
conceded victory to the Mountain-
eers at halftime because of the
ease with which the WVU offense
was moving against the Pitt de-
fense in the first half. Sure, the of-
fense could score some touch-
downs in the final half, but they
wouldn’t mean anything as long as
the West Virginia runners contin-
ued to penetrate the Pitt defense.

The Mountaineers were stop-
ped. though. And the Panther of-
fense mechanically marched

ense. slowly eating__the secondsf

Dave Havern completed the win-

"It was a day of great joy.“ De-

In Friday's three way match
;— the marksmen came in first with
a score of 1267. which is a
 marked improvement over the
.mediocre 1229 they averaged in
"preseason action. However, they
will have to do even better this
Friday if they are to beat Indiana
5 a's IUP averages in the 1300's.
They also have Bob Doverspike
who shoots in the 270’s which is
-tops in. the league.

Fridays match was the season
opener for the Pitt riflemen who

' Top scorers for Pitt were cap-
tain Bill Crooks (266), senior

For Knee

byEDCONLEY-

Cleveland Edwards was leaving the Student Un-
ion last Wednesday night in what seemed like a
pleasant enough mood. He was smiling, anyway.

"I'm going into the hospital in the morning," he
said, rather nonchalantly. “They’re not telling me
anything, but I guess I’ll be out Saturday. It’s prob-
ably just a check-up."

The Pitt basketball players visit to West Penn
Hospital wasn’t just a check—up. On the first day of
basketball practice Cleve‘s left knee gave way. and
it was discovered that
he had injured an inner
cartilage in the knee.

The cartilage was re-
moved Friday morning.

football last spring didn‘t cause the knee mishap.

Edwards tried out for the Panther gridders, but
changed his mind after the same knee gave him
problems during the summer. It was believed to
have been a cartilage then, but it was discovered

There is some bad news for Pitt basketball fans.
Freshman Bill Knight will not be eligible to com-
pete on this year's freshman team, because he
couldn't academically predict a 1.6 QPA.

Ridl gave Knight the opportunity to play his bas-
ketball somewhere else. but the outstanding high
school star decided toremain at Pitt.

“I hope he's able to get on a real good intramur-

have done better.

“Dave made a couple of errors
out on the course," he continued.
"Also, I think that Greg is still
feeling the effects of a 25-mile
marathon that he ran after last
week’s football game.“

Banner'was most pleased by
the showing of Bob Hagner who
wound up tenth.

“He ran much better in this
race than he has done all year.”

The main task confronting the
team right now, says Banner. is
“to get the ones who finished in
the second group of five up closer
to the top."

Along with Cheseborough, Rod-
gers and Hagner, Banner was re-
ferring to Mike Nolan. who fin-

“There is too big a time gap be-

bringing them up closer,” he con-
cluded.

sive and defensive position man-
ned by a returning starter. the Fi-
jis expected to dominate the
game. However. the Phi Kaps
played an aroused defensive con-
test. highlighted by Jerry
Georges performance at defen-
sive halfback.

On the last play of the first half.
George leaped high into the air to
bat down a certain touchdown
pass intended for Billy Hull.
Goerge‘s diving catch in the sec-
ond half resulted in the first of
two Phi Kappa Theta intercep-
tions.

The first and only score of the
contest was set up by Jim Ayers’
30 yard gain on a quarterback
draw. Paul Kalinsky then caught
Ayers’ five yard touchdown pass
in the left-hand corner of the end
zone. Ayers’ PAT pass to Tony
Brusca accounted for the seventh
and‘ final point of the football
game.

Both teams had several other
opportunities to dent the score-

board. but all their efforts went.

for naught. Three different times.‘

Phi Kap quarterback Jim Truitt
overthrew open receivers in the
flat. Truitt. however. certainly
made up for these incompletions.
gaining important yardage on roll-
outs. In addition. in what had
started out as a Fiji “flea-flicker"
play. Truitt intercepted a pass
thrown by Hull intended for Ayers.

In the second half. the Phi
Gams stopped the Phi Kaps on
downs inside the ten yard line. as
Rich Rizzuto knocked down two-
TD-bound passes. The Fijis them-

sleves were halted inside the Phi" I

Kap ten yard line with 30 seconds
left in the game. when Truitt
caught Ayers going back to pass.

A jubilant Rizzuto exclaimed,
“It was a rugged defensive battle
all the way.”

Kalinsky. like Rizzuto. a first
year Fiji starter. added. “Jim Ay-
ers‘ pinpoint passing was the dif-
ference." -

On the other side. Truitt ex-
plained. "It was a hard-fought
football game. but the Fijis sim-
ply outplayed us. and that is why
they won."

It’s 89 ways better than a Volkswagen. ~

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.
It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-

ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

' seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't

call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks its ‘true identity, a new name.
We call it SUPER BEETLE.
