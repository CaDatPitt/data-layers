_- “I-T WON’T be long now,” predicted a" fourth-

year man the other day._ Perhaps he was
affected by the bright, soft Spring afternoon, or
perhaps ‘the {Ides .of March whispered that warn-
ing in his ear...‘.Yet.~bef'ore the afternoon had
spent itself, oth"e"r"s had repeated that same “It
won’t be lon_'g‘now” omen. To which the pro-

q » _fess'or adds slyly, “You'"_ hope.” -

And so-youcontinue -to hurry up those steps

THE. PITT

Pseudonyms

A QUESTION of policy has been called to our
attention recently which in theory has been
fairly stated. The News has been challenged for
its. failure to attach responsibility to certain
columns appearing on the editorial page. It has
been pointed out that freedom granted a column-
ist in being permitted to voice opinion makes it
imperative that the writer standresponsible for
what is written. The’News is guilty of violating
this ac‘c_e’pted ethic. ;
We only wish the matter had been called to
our attention earlier in the year. At no time,
however, has The Newsattempted to conceal the
writer’s name for reasons that the writer or

Pittpourri, has long been a regular feature in
The News.

It has" been the most consistently -and thor-
oughly read department in The News. For the
past few months, the column has been edited by
two boys who preferred to write under the
catchy pseudonym, “The Scamps,” although
there has been, "we repeat, absolutely no effort
to conceal their identities. Any person in the
University who desired to learn the names of
the writers merely were required to ask any staff
,member of The News, and the information was
given, cheerfully. . . - I‘ *

._ Then, the other column in question, a Cherchez
La Femme, literally translated fr'om'French to
read “Find, the Women!,” was begun only two
months ago. The title of the column, itself, was

authorship._ The column has been a success‘-at
least on that score", "and.-:we maintain that the
facts 01; grounds for its*conte:*-.ts were‘checl=:ed-
and edited quite carefully. Seine of its issues

tions that are not often aired publicly. There
were few student complaints. and there wasa"
spontaneous response and support for its contin-
uance even before the second column could be
written. If the column is libelous,’ unfair, and
unpopular, then it should.be discontinued. If
these charges have been made, then they. have"
not been made to the correct source.

Atno time has even one person_come’to The
News and asked to know “in conﬁdence” the
name of the author of this column. The column,
in our opinion would hardly have its present‘
effect if the author were generally or publicly
kno_wn. In the ﬁnal analysis, it is not the writer
»who is liable for the columns of type he may
contribute to a-:_ newspaper, but rather, it is the
editor, w__-hose judgment makes him solely re-
sponsible for the exclusion or inclusion of any
news or’:-feature item in the publication. I-Io, of
course,'j"must_» consult, and be consulted. and

" Pittpourri and Cherchez La Femme are rela-
tively .,unimpor-tant in themselves, but they are
a"part of amorc important issue and policy than
‘they indicate on more face value. If we, the
editorial staff, err in some phase....of« policy, "then
we should be the first to be told about it, so that

of the mice, and which is similar to
the foetal cortex in primates." They
hope to learn what eifect, if any. the
“x” zone has_on the body, weight,
size, and sexual functions of mice.

A report states the experimenters
have begun injecting a standardized
ovarian extract into the animals, re-
peating theprocess daily for six days.
After a 72 hour rest the adrenal
glands of the mice will be examined.
In case of failure in the ﬁrst attempt,
mice of difi‘e1"‘ent ages will be used,
and the strength of ‘the extract varied.

At present, little is known about
the mysterious “x” zone, which was

‘discovered in 1920 by two Japanese.

However, if Schrnidt an-d Starkey are
successful, the results will be of great
signiﬁcance _to other men working on

the functions of endocrine glands.

Things started. slowly. as the boys
skated on the 1ce,_a little shy of the
_-fans and not at all sure ‘of them-
selves. -Dick Friday and Coover faced
of'f'for the eﬁrst time, and nervously
played with the puck until suddenly
the hard rubber was __free. Conic of
Pitt picked up the loose -puck and
skated through the whole Tech ‘outﬁt
only to ‘drop, it several yards from

' the nets.

From this "point on, neither team
was able to get within scoring terri-
tory, mainly because of poor stick
jwork, ‘crude body checking and “ice-
:fever”' . (a” hockey - term applied to
stage fright on the ice), until» the
closing seconds of the ﬁrst- period.

  Game, 24-21

In. as startling an upset as the East-
e1*11 Intercollegiate Basketball Con-
ference has ever witness'ed,,~Penn
State"s ﬁghting quintet overturned all
‘dope in defeating the,Pantl1ers Sat-
day night, 24-21, and vi1*tua.lly elim-
inating them from any chance for first
place .in«the conjferciicc.

Needinga v_ictory- to tie Temple for
the lead, ‘the Panthers bogged -(town
before, a ﬁghting-mad .Nittany_ Lion

it-was licked. It was the iirst State
rfloor victory over Pitt in the last ﬁve
'I>".93-1'5- . I . ‘- . ' . .

A huge crowd, of 6,500, ‘drawn ‘to
'-_State’s Recreation Hall as much for
the State-A_rmy-boxing match as the

 

‘basketball. game, cheered wildly all

through the battle as the Lions, down
12-7 at l1alf.ti_me, fought back irre-
sistibly to take the lead with ﬁve
minutes remaining and hold it from
a frantic. Panther ﬁve.

After a slow first half which
showed the Panthers clearly stiperior

in eve1‘_vb1'a11cl1 of the game, the

Lions suddenly came to life,,_tied up
the score at 15-15, then swept ahead
to take the verdict. An unusual .s_.i.ght

. was that of -the Panthers, usu_all~y a‘

fast-ﬁnishing team, scoring only nine
poin-ts in the ,seco1_1d half. , ‘

«Sol Miehoflj, brilliant State for-
ward, led both teams in scoring, and
exhibited such ability as no Lion

fore ‘Johnny Lawther took charge.

from,” he’ says a little shamefacedly.
A salesman gave him a. sample mop

-—:-one of the kind he liked to use, he '

si,ays—-and when "a bill was sent in to

the railroad for the mop, the boss .

asked Eddie to leave.
The nextzn-ight--Eddie went to work

for the Union Trust Company. He  :

smiles when he thinks that he was
ﬁred by a railroad and hired the next
evening by a bank. After getting
his B.S. degree in 1927. Eddie taught
at Bishop College, Texas, for three
years. At Bishop he noticed that his
pupils had trouble punching holes in
corks. So he invented a little bore-
directing machine. He needed $300
to patent it, in order to receive a rolJ
alty from a company that wanted to
buy the invention. Eddie couldn’t
raise the money, so when he went to
Chicago in 1930 he sold ‘his " bore-
directing apparatus for $25..
' Receives Fellowship

The General Education Board of
New York awarded Eddie a $1,300
fellowship to the University of Chi-
cago in 1930. “I liked to work, so
I saved part of my money and in-

vested it and some that I had saved i -
in a drugstore with my brother.” 

Then when the depression came, Ed-
die and‘ his brother -back in Texas saw

their drugstore go under..,.;'E'ddie‘ lost  - v  I’

$5,000 in “the deal.

-,'_:The next year Eddie returned here 1 
totake his doctors degree in‘..chem-

istry. Building and Grounds Super-
intendent McClain gave him his .j.ani-

_tor job, which he has been working

at since he came here. . Eddie thinks
that if it had not been’;-for Mr. Mc-_
Claiii, Registrar Quick, Secretary
John Weber, Ray" Coss, George Mc-
Feagters, and Thomas "J. Nee, the Uni-
versity foremen. he would have left
the University long ago. ’ 

“I got so tired sometimes,” he" says
thoughtfully. ‘‘I felt like giving it all
up, -‘but they gave me a little boost
and kept me working. I like research
work-—like it better than teaching.
When I get my degree this year, ..I
will probably go'into either teaching
or research work.“ I have one_?oﬁ_'e«r
waiting f,o.,r.__m_e,,but I'm not -sure;
"whether I’ll ‘take it.” 2 i

Commons

University'P,lanning Division
1 Announces Completion
Expected By June

 

With work on the Commons Room
ceiling going forward at an unprece-
dented rate of speed, and other con-
struction work also ahead of schedule,
the University planning department
expressed conﬁdence today that the
Commons Room can be ﬁnished be-
fore June 1.

. Although it had been hoped all this
winter that all work could be com-
pleted on the Room by June so that
commcnccinent exercises could be
held there, the planning department
had not been able to make any pre-
glictions up until this week. i

A force of 62 men is employed

now building the ceiling only, the
largest number ever used on this type
of ceiling, according to A. A. Klim-
check, University architect. This
work is under the di;-ection of the
R. Gaustavino Company, the only
company wliicli builds this type of
I_1l'ClleCl ceiling. _
’ The ceiling should be completely
ﬁnished by the end of the first week
in April, Mr. Kliincheck added, and
by the second or third week in April
all the scaffolding‘.Should be torn
down.

Before this occurs, however, a gang
of steam cleaners will give the lime-
stone wa.lls and ceiling the necessary
last-minute touches.

As rapidly as the scaffolding is
taken down, the ﬂoor of Vermont un-
‘fading green polished slate will be
laid. Then, with the installation of
the large wrought-iron chandeliers
‘and a few other "details, the Room
;w_ill be completed: I
. Work on the slate floor of the first-
lloor elevator lobby is expected to be
fuiished today or Tuesday, Mr. Klim-
r,-heck said, leaving this main entrance
to the Commons Room completely ﬁn-
ished. Work is also going ahead rap-
idly on the laying of floors in the
‘ﬁrst—ﬂoor corridors.
