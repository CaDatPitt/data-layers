e uhlyican presidentialnuminee
  on Paul speaks on campus

By Aaron Stier—Cohen
Staﬂ" Writer

Ron Paul isn’t pleased with the media prema-
turely declaring Mitt Romney the Republican
presidential nomineejust 10 days after Rick
Santorum dropped out of the race.

“Every once in a while we come up short
on the coverage, you know. "Evening news
doesn’t seem to cover what we’re doing,” Paul

said, to loud boos from the audience. “And

when they do, they come out with headlines
like ‘Where is Ron Paul?’ Where’s the media?
That’s what we want to know.”

Though Paul has been largely dismissed

as aviable candidate by national discourse, _

the Texas congressman and prospective Re-
publican presidential nominee ﬁlled Soldiers
8: Sailors Memorial Hall on Friday night. Paul
spoke for about an hour to an enthusiastic
crowdof more than 2,000 listeners waving
signs and wearing T—shirts to show their
support for the candidate.

Paul’s speech came just a few days before
the Pennsylvania Republican primary, which
will take place on Tuesday. ' '

On stage with his wife Carol and grand-
daughter Linda, Paul spoke to the attendees
about the importance of individual free-
doms, limited government and ﬁscal re-
sponsibility. . T .

Pitt senior Nathan Gish, an avid Ron
Paul supporter, said he isn’t worried "that
his candidate might not end up in the White

;

House.

“Whether he wins or not doesn’t matter,”
Gish said. “What matters is his message.”

Paul began his speech by going after one
of his most targeted government agencies
— the Federal Reserve System.

“Let’s get a full audit of the Federal Re-
serve and ﬁnd out what they have been doing
with our money,” Paul said.

Paul also blamed the Federal Reserve
for an expansion of government and the
economic crisis. .

“What would happen if we didn’t have a
Federal Reserve to facilitate big government
is [that] the government would have to pay
their bills,” Paul said. “And [the government]
would recognize that they couldn’t afford [to
keep spending] .” _

In what were some of the most applauded
lines of the night, Paul outlined his opposi-
tion to the United States acting as the “po-
liceman of the world.” He said that U.S. over-
seas military campaigns have cost the nation
American lives and money while alienating
many people abroad. .

“The idea of a Taliban is not to be anti-

‘ American,” Paul said. “They are anti-occupi-

ers.We worked with them against the Soviets
 Now we are the occupiers.”

Paul also addressed recent increases in
power given to police and airport security,
which he linked to the erosion of individual
civil liberties.

“If we don’t do something about it, we

. Health officials warn against ‘ i

use of Adderall as study drug .

By Gwenn Barney,
Senior StcI_ﬁ"W1_‘iter

Freshman Dan Shapiro has grown accus-
tomed to repeatedly turning down the same
proposition. ' _

. ‘‘[People] will say, ‘I know a'kid who has
a prescription for Adderall. If you need any,
I know someone who can give it to you,”’
Shapiro said. “I always say no.” -

-With ﬁnals now in full swing, many stu-
dents this week_ will face this same question:.

whether or not to take the_stimulant drug
Adderall in an effort to boost their level of
alertness to study for exams. _
In recent years, Adderall has become
a popular study aid for students on col-
lege campuses across the United States,
despite health concerns associated with
recreational use of the prescription drug.
On many campuses, including Pitt, a sort of
black market has popped up for thesale of

Adderall to students without a prescription .
_who want to study late into the night.

Typically used to treat attention deﬁ‘-V
cit disorders among other neurological
conditions, scientists believe Adderall in-
creases the ﬂow of the neurotransmitters

' dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.

The chemicals then stimulate the central
parts of the brain in a way that. increases
alertness and focus. ' -
A°2oo8 survey conducted__by the Na-
tional Survey on Drug Use and Health, one

of the most recent studies of Adderall use ‘

on college campuses, found that 6.4 percent '

of students had used Adderall on the past
year and that students between the ages
of 18 and 22 were twice as likely as non-
students to abuse Adderall.

A more recent 2011 survey of students at

‘ 119 American ‘college campuses published

in the journal'Addiction reported that 25

V percent of students at “very competitive”

campuses use‘Adderall for academic pur-
poses. ‘ 5
Shapirosaid that he knows at least ﬁve
students who use Adderall as a study aid.
“They go to the library for eight hours
and study which seems inhumanly possible’
to me. Then come back and tell me ‘I got
all thisistudying done,” Shapiro said. “It
seems like if someone tried it once they’re
going to keep doing it.” ‘
Shapiro. said that while he would never
try the drug,'his friends’ Adderall habits
don’t bother him. ' A ' I
“I don’t'really feel upset when people
use it because I do fine by just studying
the regular way. If it helps them, it helps
them. I don’t think it gives them an unfair

b

in sex and impotence.

advantage,” hesaid.

Freshman Chelsea Proulx said that she
has only heard of friends using Adderall for
recreational purposes, not to study.

‘‘I’ve never heard of people using itto
study. The one person I knew who used
it, used it to stay up all night to party not
study,” Proulx said. _

Shannon Kellgren, Pitt’s Student Health ‘
Service.Pharmacy manager, recognizes the
potential beneﬁts of Adderall for students
who need the drug for medical reasons,
but warns against recreational use of Ad-
derall. 1 . -

“Because Adderall is astimulant, it may
help the user to focus and stay awake, thus
the interest as a study drug on many cam-
puses,” Kellgren said. “Under the care and
supervision of a clinician, this medication
can be quite helpful to certain patients. ~
However, there are many risks and side»
effects associated with this drug,‘so use
should be carefully monitored by a clini-
cian.” ‘

.She noted the most serious side effects

associated with this medication include a A

fast, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, in— .
creased blood pressure, severe headache,
numbness and blurred vision. Less‘ seri-
ous side effects include headache, sleep
problems, loss of appetite, loss of interest

Kellgren added that although rare, there
are reports.of life—threatening adverse reac-
tions when taking Adderall, including heart
attacks, seizure, stroke and sudden death
in less than onepercent of those who use
the medication. ' V

Kellgren said that when taking Adderall, '

'it’s important to avoid another drug some

students rely on during ﬁnals week. .

“If taking Adderall, avoid alcohol,” she
said. “Combining Adderall and alcohol may
have deadly. consequences. It is {thought
that the combination of the two may lead
to more adverse cardiovascular effects -and
CNS [central nervous system] depression
than either agent alone.” '

Physicians at Pitt’s Student Health Ser-
vices won’t provide Adderall prescriptions
to students, but the Pitt pharmacy will ﬁll
Adderall prescriptions written by a stu-
dent’s personal physician. *

“Students must also H remember ‘that
Adderall is classiﬁed as a control1edsub—
-stance andlpossessing any such medication
without a prescription is illegal,” Kellgren
said. “Furthermore, the legal consequences
of selling a controlled substance, such as
Adderall, canbe’ severe. It is a federal of-
fense to possess a prescription that was not
prescribed for you.” 4 '

Students share to

By Josh Won
L Staﬂ’ Writer

As ﬁnals week kicks off, students disperse
around Pitt’s campus to crack open their
books, cram knowledge into their minds
and commit themselves to pages of paper
writing. -

With preferences for academic study
spaces ranging across the board from pre-

ferred volume to accessibility, The Pitt '

News set out to talk to students about the
best study spots. This is what Pitt students
had to say: ,

1. Cup 8: Chaucer on the ground ﬂoor
of the Hillman Library .

Junior Yeong Seon Han said that the
laid-back cafe atmosphere suits her talk-
ative personality.

“I don’t want to say that I am loud,”
said the biological sciences major. “But
I am deﬁnitely not a quiet person. And I

like that at the ground ﬂoor, I don’t have A

to worry about being careful, even when I
am just turning pages of books.”

Han also pointed out that during ﬁnals
week, the cafe occasionally gives out free
pastries and coffee — a deﬁnite bonus.

2. The Hillman Library, second ﬂoor

Junior Cassie Park, a history major, goes
to the second ﬂoor of the Hillman Library
to conﬁne herself to a single-person desk

_i - Cassie Park, on the Hillman Library ,

when it’s time to buckle down for ﬁnals.
“It’s quiet and calm. It has everything I
need: personal bookshelves, light and an
outlet for my laptop charger,” she said.
Unlike the ground floor, which can get
rowdy, Park appreciates the second ﬂoor’s
lack of distractions. She goes to a desk by

the window to tackle her courseload.

“It’s nice to have windows, so I don’t

feel trapped, especially when it’s sunny *

outside,” she said. ~“It ‘can get lonely
sometimes, so it’s nice to bring a buddy
so they can watch your stuff when you
need to print, grab a coffee or‘go to the
bathroom.” _ '

3. The Cathedral of Learning

“It’s not too loud, and it’s not too quiet,” "

she said. “And the [dim lighting] has a
soothing effect.” ' ‘
Since it’s at a relatively central location
on campus, Kim said that the building is
ideal to stop atlbetween classes to cram
for a‘ couple of hours. V
With the Cathedral Cafe on location,

she appreciates howeasy it is to grab some ~

brain food to snack on as she prepares
for ﬁnals.
4. Posvar Hall

cations and anthropology major, goes to

Zhang said. “There are a lot of empty

Students who want to do communal
cramming need only ﬁnd a room and put
a paper on a doorknob to establish their
reservation. In an enclosed room, students
have an ideal location for group discus-
sions and partner work.

A number of tables are also dispersed

1 around the building for student use.

5. Outside of Market To-Go in Litchﬁeld

‘ Towers

Sophomore Andrew Khoo, a chemistry

.maj or, said that Market To-Go is a ﬂexible

study environment 5 if the studier can
get past the noise. ‘

“There is plenty of space, and you can
manipulate the tables to accommodate
more people if necessary,” Khoo said.

_ He suggested that students concerned
about the noise of televisions and other
students go between meal times, when it
is much quieter._

6. William Pitt Union, ﬁfth floor

Sophomore Bao Nguyen was leaving
the dance studio on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the
Unionwhen he discovered the perfect
studyplace, including walls covered with
outlets, several tables and absolute seclu-
sion. ‘

“As long as there are no events going on
on the ﬁfth ﬂoor, it’s a nice place,” said the

economics and anthropology major. ‘‘It’s ‘

very quiet and secret.” ﬂ

Making the best of traditional study spots

By Anna Weldon
8: Adelia Mohan
The Pitt News Staﬁ" .

First Floor, Hillman library

This ﬂoor, infamously occupied by Pitt’s
Greek life, seems an unlikely option during
ﬁnals study week. With noise levels that rival
a frat party, the serious studier typically
avoids this area. '

But Hillman’s ﬁrst ﬂoor can be appealing
to those who need the noise; the absence of

sound can be even more distracting than ca-

cophony. Even so, you can avoid the constant

hum of noise with a pair of headphones.
The ﬁrst ﬂoor offers numerous tables and

accompanying outlets — a rare combina-

tion. It is located conveniently close to the

_ computer lab and, despite the large groups

of people, can be a nice place to socialize
while studying.

Soldiers and Sailors lawn (ill: a nice day) T

On the rare nice day in Pittsburgh, the
lawn in front of Soldiers and Sailors offers

students an outdoor space to study. The large
sections of open grass offer space to lie out
on a blanket with a cold drink.

Though not your typical place to study,
the Soldiers and Sailors lawn provides nat-
ural lighting, which on-campus buildings
often lack. It also has a fresh, outdoor scent
that differs from the normally stuffy atmo-
sphere of the library and computer labs.

Make sure to bring some sort of paper-
weight to the lawn. On a windy day, your
strewn papers will ﬂy off the blanket, dis-
rupting your study plans. Aside from that
disadvantage, this space is more aestheti-

cally pleasing than the boring walls and decor
of an indoor study space.

A living Room lockdown

Home is the hardest and potentially
most rewarding place to study. You can gain
weight, watch Lifetime movies, take an ac-
cidental nap and throw an impromptu dance
party. Why would anyone even attempt to
work in this danger zone? Considering the
recent disruptions on campus, you might

— be less likely to be evacuated from the ADD

cocoon of your living room.

All cons aside, an at—home lockdown
offers many beneﬁts. This is the land of
unwashed hair, dirty pajamas, stale coffee
and no bras. Nothing matters in this unhy-
gienic space except for the "obscene amount
of schoolwork you’ve neglected over the span
of the semester.

The most necessary thing to do before you
start studying is to clean. Cleanliness absorbs
the majority of distractions, and the end of a
cleaning spree provides a temporary feeling
of productivity. Ride that high all the way to
your textbook and pray it lasts.

If you manage to fail here, take a shower
and check yourself into the library. -__

Sup, my dawgs‘? It’s ﬁnals week, not that
you’d know it with all these bomb threats
going off and whatnot. I’m hella glad I found
out about those things, because I’ve been

...I haven’t had to
evacuate my building
at all — well, except

for the past_ three years, and I haven’t had
to evacuate my building at all — well, ex-

'cept for that time when the smell from the

milk jug that I’ve been using as a bathroom
became too much to take, and I didn’t have
any more Febreze to spray on it.

Anyway, these bomb threats are my
ticket back into the good graces of all these
profs who keep busting my stones with ‘ex-
ams I can’t make it to and attendance points
I’m never getting. I wasn’t even getting the
emergency alerts at ﬁrst because every time

. I get a little too into drinking the malt liquor

and 151, Iwind up busting my celly on the ce-
ment and then switching plans and numbers
so I can receive a swagalicious upgrade. But
when I logged on to my.pitt.edu to ﬁnally
pay all my library ﬁnes and tuition bills and
sh*t, I entered my new number, and  bang,
I wound up with a truly awesome excuse for
my dozens of absences:

“A bomb threat has been received for
the Cathedral of Learning, Posvar Hall and
Lothrop Hall. Please evacuate these build-
ings. If safe to do so, tell others of this mes-
sage.” '

 

As soon as I saw that, I said, “Hey, my
classes might be in those buildings.” I ﬁred
up my webmail for the ﬁrst time in months.
The quota was at 99 percent (guess Iwasn’t
“keeping it lean,” LOL), and my inbox con-
tained a bunch of messages from TAs and
other people who were trying to ﬁnd me. I
cc’d all of them on the following email:

“hey boys I’m writin 2 u 2 say that Ive had
a lot of those colds and ﬂus and now there’s
the bombs and itjust dont look like Im gonna
make it 2 class again. sry khtx. could u email
me my ﬁnals? ok, peace.”

After that, I logged into thisbros_mo-

manddad@yahoo.com, the secret email I
reserve for special occasions. If those nosy—

_ ass TAs weren’t convinced by my last email,

I intended to seal the deal with this one:

“hey boys I’m writin 2 u 2 say that my
son is in ur classes and hes been havin a lot
of colds and ﬂus plus our cancer and now
theres the bombs and it just dont look like
he is gonna make it 2 class again. sry kthx.
could u email him his ﬁnals? ok, peace. sin-
cerely, my parents.”

With those formalities out of the way, my
attendance grades were bound to bounce
back up to 100 percent. Now I just needed to

back on my.pitt.edu and wrote down my
class schedule: Composition, Intro to Psy-

Century. Typical brutal sixth-year senior
stuff, know what I’m saying?

Although I didn’t own the books for these
classes or have any of the notes, I’ve been

‘Columnist

 

It was the last day of a well-known neurosci-
ence class. Students were brimming with
curiosity, as they had the entiresemester.
Near 4 p.m., the professor became still, his
eyes surveying the audience. Like a Pavlov-
ian response, the students quieted instantly.
Today we would not learn about neural cir-
cuits or the control of food intake. Today we
would reﬂect on ourselves.

What the professor said in those 75 min-
utes is something I’ll never forget. He offered
words that were pure music to the auditory
cortex, demanding that we always try our
best, that we attain our fullest potential and
truly enjoy whatever it is we pursue in life.
He urged us to go beyond necessity,‘to nur-
ture a passion and thrive on it.

Never in my experience had a professor
dedicated an entire class to espousing such a
sentiment. It was different. And yet, had he
not, my education would be incomplete.

As I look ahead, ready to graduate and
pursue other interests, I simultaneously
reﬂect on how my time at Pitt has trans-
formed me.

Generally, there are two types of students
that enroll in college. There are those that
see it as a means —— the next rung in the lad-

der, be it economic or social. And then there

, are those thatsee it as an experience in itself.

They pursue education for education’s sake.

For them, college is a time to nurture’s one’s V_

interests and explore one’s potential.

I didn’t understand the latter perspec-
tive when I was a freshman. I had a working
excel sheet of all the courses I needed to take
to graduate in eight perfect semesters. I
planned to be a molecular biology major, and
I would have followed

think and reﬂect. Writing required that I
know exactly how I feel about a topic so I
could express myself clearly.

These opinions would have been left
undeveloped had I not needed ‘to express
them. Being a columnist has forced’ me to
cultivate new ideas, to look at a subject with
curiosity and scrutiny. It has changed the
way I perceive the world.

  Mstrategies for re

By Sarah Reagle
’ Columnist

It’s upon us: the season of stress. The ﬁnal
week of a semester can be rough. College
bodies start craving more caffeine, and Hulu
queues start piling up beyond any hope of
watching all the missed episodes. Dark times
indeed. But while there might not be away to
eliminate all the stress from your life, there
are certain things you can do to keep it at

- an" acceptable level. Below, I’ve listed a few

suggestions.
Plan ahead

This is absolutely ‘essential. If you haven’t
done so already, ﬁgure out when all of your
essay due dates and tests are, Put them on a
calendar. This might seem like it will make
you more stressed, but it shouldn’t. You can’t
change when things are due; you just need
to create a plan of attack. Once you can see
which days will be especially hectic, you know
how much you need to work ahead. When you
know you have a ﬁnal and two papers due
on the same day, you can’t plan to do all that
work 24 hours beforehand. Give yourself a
ﬂexible schedule and ﬁgure out a to-do list.
And then stick to it. '

Breaking work into pieces makes it a lot
less overwhelming. If you’re stressed about
a mountain of homework, break it up. It’ll
be signiﬁcantly less daunting when you do
it in smaller pieces. It’s like when I recently
watched someone eat a tvvo-pound hamburg-

er in one hour on  He didn’t just dive in and
start chowing down like you’d eat a normal-

sized burger. He started with the top of the

bun and worked his way through in sections.
This is what you need to do with your class-
work. Take it one step at a time.

Breathe

I mean it. If you feel really stressed out,’

take ﬁve minutes to just breathe. We’ve all
gotten through ﬁnals before, and we can all
do it again. When your mind is racing and
telling you that you can’t do it, it’s wrong.
Set it straight by moving your thoughts else-
where. If you take a few minutes to breathe
and calm down, you’ll realize that those neg-
ative thought patterns are from the stress
rather than reality.

V If you need some help centering your-
self, Pitt’s University Counseling Center
website has audio downloads with%,breath—
ing exercises that can aid your relaxation.
Listen to one when you feel overwhelmed, or
even when you don’t feel overwhelmed. It’s
easier to think clearly when you’re relaxed,
and you’ll be able to attack your work with
a sharp mind.

Geta stress-free hohhy ’

When I say hobby, I use the term loosely. If
knitting calms you down, that’s great. If you
need to exercise to de-stress, go get ’em. If you
just want to see your friends, call them,up.
But if you want to play video games or watch
Netflix, that’s ﬁne too. Find any activity that

causes you absolutely no stress — or better,
relieves stress —— and do it.

The only rule is to not let it interfere with
your work. As much as I want to engage in a
marathon re-watching of “D ownton Abbey,”
I know better than to allow that much de-

stressing. Instead, set limits to your down ”

time. If you don’t have the time to run 10
miles, runﬁve. If you can’t afford to watch a
movie, pick an episode of your favorite show.
You get- the idea. This is a time to relax, but
spending more time than necessary will only
lead to more stress once you let work pile up.
So de-stress, but do so wisely.

Write it out

If you’re having a really rough time, write
it out. Get a blank sheet of paper, and write
down everything that’s causing you any bit
of stress — even if it’s that piling-up Hulu
queue. Once you’re done, ﬁgure out what’s
worth resolving. If you can’t change it, it’s not
worth it. If it’s not urgent — let’s face it: That
Hulu queue can wait until ﬁnals are over —
it’s not worth it. Cross out what’s not worth
worrying over. Once you’re done, your list will
be a lot shorter, and you’ll feel a lot better just

. having jotted it down on paper.

Finally, ﬁnd ways to eliminate your re-
maining stressors. If it’s a test, ﬁgure out
when to study. If it’s a paper, set aside some
time to write it. If it’s your annoying signiﬁ-
cant other, just send them a quick break-up
text, and you’re totally free. Even if you won’t
be entirely at ease until the end of ﬁnals, you’ll
at least know what to worry about and, more

dueing your stress level during finals week

importantly, what not to worry about.
Make time for fun

We don’t cease to be social creatures dur-
ing these last few days of work. There’s still
a place for fun, even if it’s slightly modiﬁed
from your usual binge-drinking—for-three-
days weekends. You probably shouldn’t binge
drink all week. _But everyone needs to make
time to be social. If you want to study with
friends, that’s ideal. If you want to go out for a
drink, do it.]ust be responsible. If you’re any-
thing like me, a night of debauchery means a
day of being a useless blob of a human being.
So think ahead, and don’t go crazy if you need
to get a lot of work done the next day.

' If you’re thinking to yourself, “I really
just don’t have time for ﬁin. I’ve been up for
three days straight, and I have a lot of work to
do,” then you’re wrong. First of all, everyone
should make time to sleep, Sleepy minds do
sloppy work. Secondly, going nonstop every
day until the end of ‘ﬁnals isn’t good for you.
You need to make time —— even a lunch — for
friends, or you’ll be on the bus home for the
summer thinking about how much you wish
you’d hung out with your friends a little more.
And you’ll probably cry. Since nobody wants
that to happen, just carve out a little chunk

, of time, and spend it being happy.

Take a deep breath. Now exhale. You’re
ready to face the dark days that lie ahead,
and you’re going to be totally great. I

Needless to say, it’s been a rough year.
From an unexpectedly poor basketball
season to the recent bomb threats to the
budget cuts, Pitt students have contended
with challenge after seemingly endless
challenge.

But fear not — the following is a list of
reasons why you should maintain your Pitt
pride and stay here through ﬁnals week,
regardless of how high your or your par-
ents’ anxiety level is right now.

cathedral of learning

The Cathedral is easily Pitt’s most dis—.
tinctive landmark. Listed as the ﬁfth-tallest
educational building in the world (this is a
Pathﬁnder fact), the monument perfectly
embodies the courage and resilience of its
students. Some of my fondest memories
involve looking up at the victory lights after
a difficult Pitt Panthers win. Granted, this
hasn’t happened since last year, but I’m
conﬁdent it will happen again.

Regardless of your feelings about how the
threats are being handled or how little
information is released to students, you
have to acknowledge that it’s clear these

reasonable so as many people as possible

you were when you graduated from high
school. Now think about the person you
are. Lastly, think about the type of person

No post-gmdplans? Answer with
one of these oddball careers  

By Natalie Bell

The end is coming.» Closer. Closer. Too

V close.

‘Graduation is just a few calendar squares
away, and many of us have no idea how to
ask ourselves what we’re doing next, let

' alone answer the constant stream of “and
.what are your plans?”

That question is always from the intimi-

' dating, curious eyes of someone looking

to use the lengthy pause of our responses

to talk about that exciting ‘new job they.

just landed. 401K, what? Health insur-
ance, who? The only health beneﬁt I’m
acquainted with is waking up without a
hangover.

In’ the midst of my floundering, I re-
membered a gem of advice from my mom,
who was almost push_e_d‘into nursing by a
high school guidance counselor _who ig-

nored her aversion to blood. Because my

mom had no career plans, this persistent
counselor continued to force the issue.
Eventually, tired of refuting the sugges-
tion, my mom declaredlthat she wanted to
become a diamond cutter. Aftermy mom
rattled off facts she’d learned in a’TV spe-

cial the night before, the counselor was

silenced.

I’m not going to advocate lying as a form
of avoidance or say that my mother was a
mischief maker, but sometimes a funny or
oddball answer is more fun than “I don’t
know.” , V

So in order to get people off your back,_

I bring you a list of options -— replete with ~

information on said paths — to shut up the

-naggers in your life, Besides, who knows?

You might end up with the consuming de-
sire to write romance novelsor deliver your

' clown College

A ' A _ . MCT Campus
Much like this clown, you may find yourselfcontemplatively staring into the vast
expanse ofan uncertain future.

Tell people you’ve been inspired to fol-
low in your favorite clown’s footsteps. The I
succeeding question will request further
inform_ation about this figurehead. Go
ahead and make up a name. What’s the
likelihood you’re talking to someone ac-
quainted with the professional clowning
community? , . ‘d

Then just open your mouth and start
spewing. V '

Back in the day — around the ’70s —
clown college was more difficult to break
into than the Ivy League. The Ringling
Bros. and Barnum 8: Bailey Circus opened
a clowning school in 1968 to ensure a
constant, competitive stream of classic
comedy. . ' ' » . ,

Today, there are numerous clown colleg-
es, but no accreditation system — though
there might be commedia dell’arte pro-
grams at accredited institutions —— so as
Stealers Wheel lamented,*it’s all “clowns to

-the left of me, jokers to the right.” Clown-

ing can be a tough biz to break into.

On the bright side, that means you can
say you’re going almost anywhere, like the
Ohio College of Clowning Arts of Fuddi-
Duddy Institute. On the downside, it can
be a tough occupation to start out in and,

as the eHow.com clown college article says, .

you have to “determine.if you have what it

, takes to be a clown.” ' .
If youpee your pants and cry at-the a

sight of clowns or if you’re just not funny

‘(be honest with yourself), people might
’_ suspect you’re pulling their leg.

“We have been too lackadaisical, so we need
to wake up and start doing something about
it.”

Paul also stumbled around gay rights

for a small portion of his speech, stopping
short of explicitly addressing the issue, but

conceding that people have a right to live

the way they want. - _

‘ “Why is it so much that, if we give people
the freedom to practice their lifestyle, that
we are endorsing behavior that is unbecom-
ing?” Paul said. “You have to have more

tolerance.”
Paul also touted his drug policy, saying

that people should be allowed to use drugs

and deal with the consequences them-
selves. -
“I happen to disapprove of the use of most
drugs,” Paul said. “But it’s the whole idea of
allowing who is ‘going to make these deci-
sions for us.”

Paul stressed that his message is about
a push for maximum freedom, the freedom
to succeed or to fail. The self—proclaimed
revolutionary attacked Republicans and
Democrats alike, saying that the former
party has a horrible track record as far as
protecting civil liberties whereas the latter
opposes economic liberties. I

tion. To make this a little less creepy, the
publisher emphasizes a “low level of sexual
tension; characters should not make love
unless they are married.”

Another is the “Desire” series, requir-
ing a well-off and externally harsh hero.
“Beneath his alpha exterior, he displays
some vulnerability, and he is capable of
being saved." It’s up to the heroine to get
him there. The Texan hero should own
the ranch, not work on it, and the urban
hero should be someone in charge, not a
handyman.” Essentially it perpetuates the
misguided “he’ll change” notion.

Historical, medical —— explore the web-
site and pick a genre to tell people you’re
writing in. Just tell them it’s relevant to
your major — the bookseller probably has
a subgenre your interests will work for.

But if you’re the love-,hating cynic‘

among your friends or barely literate,
people might guess this is ﬁction. '

Selling Your Body ,

You’ve spent your weekends — and
probably weekdays — drinkingland eat-
ing pizza, so don’t pretend your body is
suddenly a “sacred temple.” Prostitution
might be illegal, but you can sure as heck
legally sell that mess of yours to science.

Drug companies are looking for partici-
pants for clinical trials to test drug safety.
Say you’re integral in researching how to
bring‘ the next Viagra onto the market or
the new miracle drug that will help people
quit smoking. Some people just want a
piece of you —— skin cells, eggs, sperm,
plasma, etc. Tell people you plan on making
a pretty penny on the vessel you’ve spent
the last four years abusing.

If you feel squeamish about saying

i that you’re whoring out your body,‘ tell

them you’ll whore out your mind. Uni-

versities and research centers often have ‘

psychological and mental testing, such» as
researching literacy, or, say, the Milgram
experiment (no one said it was all painless
reading).

You can tell them that even though you
have a degree, this body of yours. is practi-
cally made of money —- why not cash in?

In fact, here at Pitt, you could have been_

doing it all along through the clinical re‘-
search center: wwvv.clinicalresearch.pitt.

ledu. Butif you vomit at the sight of blood,

can’t look at needles, or have sensitive pho-
bias, this might come off as a disingenuous
career choice. ' .
Obligatory warning: Clinical trialsare
important, but they can have negative
physical and mental health consequences
—- always do your own research, ask ques-
tions and read the ﬁne print before getting
involved,in_ a study. - f
So nexttime someone asks, “What do
you want to do with your life?” don’t be
afraid to whip out an odd career and give

\ them a deadpan answer. Snap, some of-

these might "really appeal to you — after
all, these are real ways people make money.

Weighing the pros and cons of staging in Pittsburgh
this summer

By Elizabethweisel
Columnist

At the end of every spring semester, college
students get ready to face the changes’ that
the summer will inevitably bring. For some,
this means summer classes; for others, a
part—time job or internship, and for still
others, a summer lounging in a hammock
reading romance novels.

But for those of us who are from outside
the great city of Pittsburgh, one crucial ques-
tion accompanies the advent of summer:
Should we stay or should we go?

Since we live in Pittsburgh for eight
months out of the year, it seems only natural

to go home again for the summer months. .

Nonetheless, there are important beneﬁts
and downsides to staying in town.

One disadvantage to staying in Pittsburgh
for the summer is that you’ll likely be living
far away from the rest of your family. De-
pending on the relationship you have with
your parents or siblings, it might be difficult
to remain away from them for the whole
year. During the semester, at least, you know
you have the summer to look forward to be-
ing home among the rest of your family.

On the other hand, living away from your
parents can liberating. Without their‘con—

, friends were always

stant surveillance, you’re free to become a
fully independent and self—suﬁicient human
being. Staying away from home offers you
the opportunity to experience true indepen-
dence from your family.

For some, however, it’s easier to ﬁnd jobs
in small hometowns, especially if you know
the right people. Personally, I’ve never had
trouble ﬁnding employment when I’m home
—— my parents or

Another advantage to going home is the
ability to see old friends and visit with the
people you might be too far away from to
see while you’re at school. While it’s easy to
keep in touch via Facebook, Skype, email or
what—have—you, it’s always more enjoyable
to see.,your friends in person and hang out
like you used to in the old days.

If you don’t keep in touch with any of your

' old friends, however,

able to connect me
with opportuni-
ties.

But Pittsburgh
also offers a pleth-
ora of jobs, espe~
cially in Oakland
and around college
campuses where
businesses are sure
to lose some em-
ployees when stu-

One crucial question
accompanies the
advent of summer:
Should we stay or
u should we go’?

it’s probably better

and maintain the new
friendships you’ve
made. There are so
many local Pittsbur~
ghers that go to school
here, chances are
you’ve made friends
with a few of them
and could use the
summer to foster your
relationships without

dents return home

for the summer. just

the sheer size and population of the city
offers more opportunities for internships
with bigger companies or more impressive
jobs. The city has a lot to offer inlthe job
market, particularly for young, bright col-
lege students. A

any homework hang-

ing over your head.

Summer offers an opportunity to embark
on new adventures with your new friends.

The biggest advantage to going home is

that it’s likely much cheaper. At home you 

have a warm bed, food in the kitchen and a
couch — all for free. Especially if you work

to stay in ‘Pittsburgh

while living at home, you’ll have plenty of
money to.spend when you return to school.
With rent payments and bills hanging over
our heads, it’s a great relief to return for
the summer, where your biggest worry is
what sort of change you’ll ﬁnd in the couch
cushions.

However, maybe it’s worth the money to

” stay and experience Pittsburgh this summer.

There’s so much we don’t encounter dur-
ing the school year — events like Cinema
in the Park at Schenley Park or even free
music shows in Schenley Plaza. The summer
months are perfect for getting some Dave
and Andy’s ice cream and strolling through
the citylwithout the hustle and bustle of
thousands of-students surrounding you.
With your free time you can visit museums,
go to Pirates games, ride the incline, do any-
thing you wanted to do during the school
year but couldn’t because you had to study.
Pittsburgh deserves to be experienced.
Maybe where you come from is a really
awesome place, and you love going home
every summer, but I would give Pittsburgh
a chance. If for no other reason than to try
something new, get out of your comfort
zone, and experience an amazing city.

Pitt withdraws rewarclafter receiving anony

By Michael Macagnone
V Editor in Chief

A group calling itself “The Threaténers”

has claimed that it will stop sending bomb
threats to Pitt buildings because the Uni-
versity dropped its $50,000 reward offer
for information in the case.

The group, in a pair of untraceable emails
sent Friday and Saturday to The Pitt News,
claimed responsibility for threats emailed
after Pitt ﬁrst offereda $10,000 reward

for information on March 30, more than a _

month after bomb threats at Pitt began.
The ﬁrst email, received on Friday, said,
“This all began when you, Nordenberg,'put

out a $10,000 — then $50,000 — ‘reward’.

(bounty) for some young kid who’d pranked
the University.” . . V W
i The Friday email also references an email
threat against the chancellor’s residence
sent to the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette on April
10, when the group ‘made the same offer.
This offer was not reported by the media

at the time. I y ,
Pitt received Friday’s email from “The

Threateners,” forwarded by The Pitt News,
on Friday afternoon.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill conﬁrmed
that Pitt had withdrawn the reward, but said
that he could not comment beyond that. '

He said in an email Friday that, on the

advice of federal law enforcement" officials
leading the investigation,  University
had decided after receivingthe April 10
threat “to avoid any form of negotiation
with anonymous correspondents claiming
responsibility for the criminal acts that have
disrupted the lives of our students and of the
broader community.” - 0 '  if 7

He said that the University, along with

’ law enforcement, would continue to pursue

“an appropriate end through the arrest and
conviction of those who have committed
these crimes.” -

The email received by The Pitt News
from “The Threateners” on Saturday also
disavowed any association with people “pub—
licly identiﬁed as suspects, or ‘persons of
interest,”’ in the case. _ . _

The only publicly identiﬁed persons of

interest in the case are a couple from]ohn—'

stownlz former Pitt student Seamus ]ohn—
‘ sto_n,,22, and Katherine Anne’ McCloskey,

56, whowere subpoenaed to appear before a
federal grand jury and provide information
on April 12.

J The iériiails

Both emails sent to_ The Pitt News over

V the weekend included certain similarities

to each other and previous emails that,in—
creased their credibility. - .
Friday’s email accurately predicted a 24-

' hour gapin threats from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 '

a.m.. Saturday. After 8 a.m. Saturday morn-
ing, Plittevacuated eight buildings: Litchﬁeld
Towers, the Cathedral of Learning, and Salk,
Pennsylvania, Ruskin and Scaife halls.
The email on Friday also mentioned the
offer on April 10 that had previously gone

mous emails

unreported.

“We make the same offer to you now.
Simply withdraw the ‘reward,’ and we will
end our actions permanently,”»Friday’s email
said. ' .

Both emails employed the Mixmaster
email remailer reportedlyused in sending
the other threats and was forwarded through
the same ﬁnal server before reaching The
"Pitt News. ‘ y.  . 

The Mixmaster program is an anony-
mous remailer that sends an email to mul-
tiple servers before it arrives at its ﬁnal
destination. T E"

Friday’s email, formatted as a letter to the
editor, addressed Chancellbr Mark Norden—
berg and the Pitt administration.

, The second message, sent on Saturday,
was called a “press release,” and addressed
the end of the authors’ “campaign” against
Pitt and the group’s non—afﬁliation withnthe
Johnstown couple. ‘  V

Both emails were forwarded to Pitt ad—
ministration and Pitt police; These were the
ﬁrst such emails that did  threaten a Pitt
building that have come to light.

Pitt outlimgs new finals,
evacuation policies

By Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt students might have some visitors dur-
ing their ﬁnals this week: police who will
sweep, but not evacuate, exam locations.

Patricia Beeson, Pitt’s provost and senior
vice chancellor, sent a letter to students Sun-
day that announced the University’s plan
for ﬁnals week. Finals will be held in ﬁve
buildings, which will have increased secu-
rity and be swept for explosives before each
exam day.

Law enforcement officials will assess any
threat that might be sent to these ﬁve build-
ings, and the buildings will only be evacuated
if a received threat is viewed as imminent. If
a threat is received but isn’t believed to be
imminent, affected buildings will be swept
for explosives’ but not evacuated.

“These arrangements reﬂect the expert
advice we have received from law enforce-
ment professionals, the experience we have
gained over the past several weeks and the

' special circumstances associated with ﬁnals

week,” Beeson said in the email.

Final exams will take place in Alumni"

Hall, Benedum Hall, the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, Chevronscience Center and David Law-
rence Hall. A revised listing of the exam
room for each speciﬁc ﬁnal will be available
at my.pitt.edu at least 24 hours prior to its
scheduled start time. In keeping with current
procedure, students, staff and faculty will
be required to show Pitt IDs and have their
bags checked by security before entering
exam locations. ‘
Sophomore Brittany Cabot has two ﬁnals
this week. While her Physics II exam will
be held in David Lawrence, she will have

to wait 24 hours before" her Intro to Neu— '

roscience exam to receive the classroom
assignment.

“It’s kind of comforting to know thatl can
go into a test and not have to rush through
it thinking a bomb threat will go off at any
time. I can now take my time and answer all

, questions thoroughly,” Cabot said.

Residence halls will be swept for explo-
sives every evening, with access still limited
to those with Pitt IDs. If a threat is received

' for a_dorm, law enforcement officials will

assess it and decide if it is imminent.

Beeson said that if a threat to a dormitory
is not deemed imminent, Pitt will send out an
ENS alert saying, “A threat has been received,
but it is not believed to be genuine, and that
evacuation is voluntary, not mandatory.”

If a threat is viewed as imminent, alarms
will go off and Pitt will evacuate the affect-
ed buildings. Targeted buildings will be
searched regardless of whether mandatory
evacuation occurs. _

For all other non-dormitory campus
buildings, current procedures will remain
the same.

Cabot said the even though Pitt will not
evacuate after a bomb threat is received in
all cases, she still feels safe.

“They said we’d be notiﬁed if there is
imminent danger and I trust their judgment
because they have been dealing with these
for weeks. I do not feel threatened or endan-
gered by this policy in any way,” she said.
“But I do like how they’ll text us for dorms,
so evacuating is optional but not mandatory.
It gives individuals who feel nervous the
opportunity toleave while not disrupting
the rest of us.” .

Pitt received eight bomb threats Saturday,
following six threats targeting dormitories
early Friday morning.

At 9:50 a.m. Saturday, Pitt sent out an «

Emergency Notiﬁcation System alert no-
tifying the campus of bomb threats at Li-
tchﬁeld Towers, Salk Hall, the Cathedral of
Learning, Pennsylvania Hall, Ruskin Hall
and Scaife Hall. ‘

All of the targeted buildings were evacu-
ated and were cleared by 12:15 p.m.

Freshman Kayla Martine, who lives in
Litchﬁeld Towers, has been evacuated mul-
tiple times from her dorm —- but continues
to stay on campus, even after all of her ﬁnals
moved online. V

“I feel like most of the people who felt
unsafe in the situation havealready left, but
I think that this will now make people feel
safer in the sense that we won’t have to worry
about evacuating in the middle__of the night
while we still- have exams,”,Martine said.

Staff Writer Megan Trimble contributed
to this story. ﬂ

EDITORIAL

Needless to say, this is hardly an ideal time
to graduate from Pitt. In additionto an un-
predictable economy, the class of 2012 faces
the very real possibility that a bomb threat

will disrupt, perhaps even cancel, the»April ,
2'9 convocation. And although one group '

has promised to stop ‘sending threats, the
University’s secrecy has kept us in a height-
ened state of anxiety. A

As most readers are probably aware, Pitt
withdrew its $50,000 reward on Saturday, a
day after The Pitt News received an anony-
mous email claiming that the threats would
cease if the University did so. Shortly there— «
after, we received a second email announcing
an immediate end to the “campaign.”

Incidentally, this wasn’t the ﬁrst time
“The Threateners,” as they refer to them-
selves, proposed such terms. On April 10, an
email sent to the Post— Gazette contained the
same offer, alongside a threat against Chan-
cellor Nordenberg’s house. In that instance,
however, University spokesperson Robert
Hill said that the administration chose “to
avoid any form of negotiation with anony-
mous correspondents claiming‘responsibil-
ity for the criminal acts that have disrupted

the lives of our students and of the broader '

community.” .
Although it seems likely that the reward

withdrawal had something to do with the re-

cent email, Pitt has yet to explain its actions. a

April 23, 201 2 l The Pitt News l wx/Wv..r3lttnevvs.eem

Unfortunately, that’s all too characteristic
of the administration’s «recent approach to

public relations. Regardless of whether law.
enforcement agencies advised them against .

disclosing certain information, University
officials should at least make their intentions
clear. On April 11, for example, they needed
to ‘announce that “The Threateners” wanted
them to repeal their reward, and that, after
careful deliberation, they’d declined to do so.
That alone would have been sufficient.

This lack of transparency extends well
beyond this weekend’s turn of events, how-
ever. The University’s plans for ﬁnals week,
for instance, should’ve been made public
much sooner, especially since they entail
new test locations and_ security measures.

More importantly, we need to know
immediately how Pitt plans to handle its
graduation ‘ceremonies. If guards will be
checking IDs at the doors, or if students will
_be required to present any other documenta-
tion, that information should be made public
today. Otherwise, many seniors and their
families might be unable to prepare for the
new strictures in time.

We won’t speculate about whether or not
withdrawing the reward was a smart move.
What we can say for sure, however, is that the
University has fostered a climate of suspi-
cion and uncertainty by refusing to keep the
communityinformed. We understand that

Pitt’s lack. of transparency unjustifiable T

Although it seems
  likely that the reward
withdrawal had

something to do with‘

the recent email, Pitt
has yet to explain its
acﬁons.

the recent threats have placed Pitt officials
in an extraordinarily difﬁcult position, and

‘that they can’t simply disclose every new
lead they discover. But the administration
has thus far remained unwilling to answer
even the most basic questions. For a Univer-
sity whose motto is “truth and virtue,” that
seems hard to justify.

l Sglring of bomb thre

By Pat McAteer
Staff Writer

As she walks through her ﬂoor in Litchﬁeld
Tower A, Lauren Ungar has noticed a popu-
lation decrease. _
L Ungar, a freshman, said at least 10 of the
“girls on her ﬂoor couldn’t handle the sleep
loss, which began to affect some of their
grades. So they chose to ﬁnish their work at
home or at a nearby relative’s home.

Most floors in Tower A house 38 students
and one Resident Assistant.

Unlike someof her peers,-Ungar decided
to stick it out for the semester because she
is in the process of joining an honors fra-
ternity and also wanted to be here for ﬁnal
exam review sessions’. But it hasn’t been

. easy.

“It’s just becoming really difﬁcult to get
all of my work done because I’m so tired,
and there aren’t many places to go because

' you have to have your bags checked,” Ungar
said. “It’s just really a nuisance.”

Like the residents on Ungar’s ﬂoor, many
Pitt students have decided, because of the
more than 7o dormitory evacuations due to
bomb threats, to leave campus.

Pitt could not provide a ﬁgure on the
number of students who have left campus.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said “data has
not been compiled on withdrawals.”

Pitt spokesman John Fedele also said
the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid
didn’t have ﬁgures for the number of with-
drawals since the bomb threats began. He
added that numbers were still being com-
piled, and OAFA will have the statistics after
the semester is over. '

In light of the departures, Pitt "admin-
istrators have mandated that professors

D provide accommodations for students who

chose to go home so that they do not have
to withdraw from classes. _

Ungar said that many of the missing
residents on her ﬂoor felt that the online
accommodations — like lectures and online
ﬁnals — allowed for a sense of security and
a better learning environment.

“I think mostly it’s because more of the
dorms are being targeted, and people aren’t
getting sleep, and they can’t do their wor ,”
Ungar said. “It’s just easier to go home now
that the teachers have to have a plan for

them to take theirﬁnals online. It’s just an ’ -

easier alternative.”

Despite the mandated accommodations
for outgoing students, some professors ﬁnd
it difficult to emulate the in-class experi-
ence and have continued making attendance
mandatory. . .

Freshman Bethany Murray, a resident
of Tower A, said she moved home but was
forced to return to Pitt after the professor
told the class that attendance still factored

intotheir-grade.

“My lab TA said they wouldn’t excuse
[absences] and that we had to be there for
them,” Murray said. ’

While Murray said the string of bomb»
threats frustrated her and other students,

she also said most students plan to return
to Pitt next year. ‘ “

“I haven’t heard anyone say they’re not
coming back,” Murray said. “They’re just
more frustrated that they haven’t‘ caught
anyone.” I

EMAILS

FROM PAGE 25

the University had received more than 60
threats. A S

It is unclear whether a request by Pitt
police chief Tim Delaney on April 4 is related
to the April 10 threat or Friday.’s email to The
Pitt News. Delaney asked that the perpetra-
tors contact him if they had an issue with
the University. I

“I want to see if the individual doing this
will contact me,” Delaney said at the time.
“It may be a student, it may not be a student.
Whoever it is, give me a call.”

The investigation

In the latest step in increased security

‘measures, Provost Patricia Beeson sent a

letter to students Sunday detailing Pitt’s
plans for ﬁnals week. See The Pitt News’
related story on Page 26 for more details
on the ﬁnals preparations.

The measures came as the University’s

' semester entered its ﬁnal week. There have

been more than 140 bomb threats to various
campus buildings since February.

Saturday morning’s threats brought Pitt’s
semester total to 143, a count that began
with a threat in a women’s ba?'throom.at the

-Chevron Science Center on Feb. 13. From

mid—February until the end ofivlarch, threats
came intermittently —- at most two a week
— and only targeted Chevron and the Ca-
thedral of Learning through threats written
on bathroom stalls. if

_ After the University offered a $10,000
reward on March 30 followed by a.$50,000
reward on April 2, the threats became more
frequent, used an anonymous email remailer
program and began targeting dormitories
and multiple buildings at once. In the in-
tervening three weeks, the University has"
received more than 100 threats.

Thegstring of threats has drawn the atten- .

tion of federal law enforcement oiﬁcials, in-
cluding the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys Office and
the J oint Terrorism Task Force. U.S. Attorney
for Western Pennsylvania David I-Iickton
announced last week that law enforcement
officials had narrowed the investigation to
a list of “potential suspects.” ﬂ

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

‘_1.‘, 2

Vinny Mattiola founded a sail-
ing club. Now he just needs some
boats.

Last November, the_Pitt soph-

,.,,._omore created Panther Sailing

Club, a campus organization for
students interested in recreational
or competitive sailing. But without
funding for boats, the club spent
this school year meeting in the Ca-
thedral of Learning on Thursday

(“nights — sometimes in hallways

—— watching sailing videos, hosting
discussions with sailing instructors
and breaking down race theory on
a chalkboard.

“I can get 20 people to come to a

g weekly meeting to look at a chalk-

board and watch sailing videos for
a whole semester,” Mattiola said:
“It’s disappointing for me not to
be able to tell these kids they can

. ub F} 5.’.-1illmat‘:a' out on the W

get on the water.”

The sailing club initially asked
for about $50,000 from Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government Board in order to
purchase seven Club F] sailboats,
the -minimum number required,
according to Mattiola, to join US
Sailing’s Inter—Collegiate Sailing
Association. Mattiola said that the
board told him his requests had a
better chance of passing if he de-
creased his total cost, so he lowered
his expenditures to four boats. In
the end, though, only transpor-
tation costs passed through the
Allocations Committee.

“[Fiftythousand dollars] sounds
so unrealistic, but it is realistic in
the sustainability aspect,” Pitt se-
nior Britta Anderson, an officer in
the club, said. “Once you have your
ﬂeet of boats, they’re good for as
long as they’re seaworthy.”

SGB_ President James Lan-
dreneau said that since this is the
sailing club’s ﬁrst year of existence,

l‘hc l“.m1l1e1'S.1iling Club do

the Board wants to see the team
grow before it provides increased
funding. '

Landreneau said that Pitt once
had askydiving club that SGB pro-
vided with parachutes, but since
the student who started the club
was a senior, it only lasted for one
year. i .

“The rationale behind every-
one’s decision when we voted was
to make sure-we enable the group
as much as possible, and if the sail-
ing club truly shows they are here
for the long haul, then I’m sure in
the future they will get some kind
of funding for a boat or whatever it
may be,” Landreneau said. “Right
now, transportation to a practice
site was the decision of the Board
and the Allocations Committee
this time around.” Mattiola said
his budget proposal to the SGB ac-
counted for 15 years of expenses;

The club had two boats donated
during the school year, but it had

l__v own any oat, and 1102‘;
no money or means to dock them.
The sailboats are not in Pittsburgh,
Anderson said.

“We don’t have a place to keep
them,” she said. “They’re prob-
ably sitting in someone’s=garage or
front yard waiting to have a place
to go.” '

Mattiola said he had consid-
ered paying for the docking fees
himself. - '

Soon, Panther Sailing Club will

“ﬁnally sail. Mattiola said that the

club will drive to Lake Arthur in
Moraine State Park, about an hour
north of Pittsburgh, on weekends
this summer to sail for the ﬁrst
time. ’

Mattiola said the club has a
deal to use a community’-owned
ﬂeet open to Moraine Sailing Club”
members.’ He also said the club
recently received a third donated
boatfrom its instructor, which is
clocked at Lake Arthur where the
club can use it freely.

atlieilml

'I..ea1'mng.

This past school year,.the loca-

tion of Lake Arthur made sailing ‘

there a challenge even if the club

’ had its own boats.
“For a while, no one had cars,”
Mattiola said. “We had. mostly

younger students involved, be— ‘
- cause from the get—go we knew we

weren’t going to'5'get on the water
muchthat semester, so seniors
weren’t really that interested.”
And boat rentals weren’t pos-
sible, either. p
_ “You,can rent a kayak and teach
someone to kayak in 15 minutes,
but you can’t teach someone to
sail in 15 minutes,” Anderson
said. “You don’t have enough time.
Someone just can’t do it for the day
and go home. It will take you a little
while to sail.’_’ ' f
Rentals, she said, are mainly for
feicperienced sailors. Experience
levels within Panther Sailing Club
span the entire spectrum‘.

Men’s basketball Jamie Dixon could feasibly ﬁnish his career at Pitt.

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

I never liked using “I” when writing, which
should make this farewell interesting.

I typically only looked into the past
to mention overlooked history, like Pitt’s
1915 football co—championship, Smokyjoe
Wood’s career earned run average and the
Schenley Park Casino, which burned down
in 1896. I suppose I grew bored with Brett
Favre and LeBronJames. _

To spend a few paragraphs reﬂecting on
four years of writing —_ from an intramu-
ral football story freshman year to a mam-
moth mock selection committee project this
spring — goes against what I aimed to do
with most of my work.

I’ve been at this newspaper forever. I

don’t know if I am the longest—tenured active
staff writer, but I must be at least tied for
that record. I. joined the orientation week
of my freshman year, 2008.

Thank you to everyone that read my col-
umn. I would spend more time thanking
everybody that playeda role in my life over
the past four years, but, well, nobody wants
to read that. Instead, I want to spend my
ﬁnal page of print looking forward.

I knew this farewell was coming, so over
the past few weeks I’ve been making a list.
I wrote down some things that I think will
happen at Pitt. Other items on the list are
more wishful thinking. But I’d like to share
it, and, if I am bored 20 years from now,
maybe then it will be a good time to look
back and reﬂect.

1. The school scraps “Sweet Caroline”
in favor of a new tradition: each game a
different student singing group performs
“Hail to Pitt” after the third quarter. Soon,
people know more than just “alleghenee,
genac, genac, genac,” a line dwarfed by the
enthusiastic “Pitt! Pitt!” cheers featured in
the song. .

Freshman Sevilla leads
Panthers’ offense

Ryan Samson I For The Pitt News

Freshman Maggie Sevilla has recorded nine hits in her last nine games.

By R] Sepi_ch
Staff Writer

o

Opposing pitchers are beginning to fear the
voice of rapper T—Pain at the Petersen Sports
Complex. c

That’s because when the hip—hop art-
ist’s catchy tune “Booty Wurk” comes over
the loud speakers at the second—year home
of the Pitt softball team, it means that the
Panthers’ lead—off hitter Maggie Sevilla is
taking her place in the batter’s box.

With" nine hits in her last nine games,
Sevilla has led an improving Pitt offense as
the Panthers (25-22, 8-11) look to ﬁnish off a
challenging season on a strong note.

After recording her ﬁrst career multi-
home run game in a win against DePaul -

. one of the Big East’s best teams —— last week-

end, Sevilla guided the Panthers to victory
with the long ball once again on Saturday
evening against Connecticut.

With one swing of the bat, Sevilla smacked
her seventh home run of the season over the
centerﬁeld fence and broke open what had
been a tight, defensive game as her three-run
shot gave Pitt a 5-0 lead.

Sevilla said she was happy to hit ﬁnal-
ly her ﬁrst career home run at her home
ﬁeld. _ .

“Hitting those two last week at DePaul
deﬁnitely gave me a lot of conﬁdence, and
then hitting my ﬁrst home run here was such
a great feeling,” she said following Saturday’s
doubleheader, which the Panthers split with
the Huskies.

She nearly repeated the feat in the sixth
inning. With two outs and two ‘runners on
base, Sevilla hit another deep ﬂy ball, but
Pitt’s Vartabedian Field at the Petersen
Sports Complex proved too deep as the ball
was caught near the wall.

The Panthers ﬁnished off the Huskies in
the ﬁrst game by a score of 6-0, but split the
doubleheader after losing the second game
to Connecticut 10-5 in wet, chilly condi-
tions. Pitt won the third game of the series
1-0 on Sunday.

Pitcher Savannah King, one of SeVilla’s
fellow freshmen, said that’ the Pitt desig_
nated hitter has been gaining se1f—conﬁdence
and improving all season. ' ' _

“We’re best friends and roommates,” King
said. “She has a lot of conﬁdence right now,

A Spring after spring, the hope that _blos-

However, the glimmer of hope that ap-
peared during the Buccos’ brief stay in ﬁrst

Rivers,Brizzi
embrace role as
walk-ons

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Nick Rivers never hit a game—winning shot
and was never named an All-American.

He never heard his name when the an-
nouncer called out the starting lineup for
the Pitt men’s basketball team. But when
Pitt fans see him on campus, they know his
name. And they ask him to dance.

Rivers and freshman women’s basketball
player Brianna Brizzi are walk—ons —— ath-
letes who contribute to the team without
being actively recruited or given athletic
scholarship money.

For walk-ons, the college athletics expe-
rience isn’t about moving on to the profes-
sional level. In most cases, coaches didn’t re-
cruit them. Brizzi was drawn to Pitt’s nursing
program. Rivers, an Arizona native, wanted
a new experience.

team before the start of the game.

Rivers’ dance — a blend of hip-hop and
breakdancing —- has been a tradition in Pitt’s
pregame huddle ever since.

“I remember going out there and making
the fans go wild and feeling that energy, and
feeling likel was really part of something,” he
said. “It was on ESPN the next day, and all my
friends from home and everyone saw it.”

He said more people recognize him for
his dancing than his playing, but he doesn’t
mind. He appreciates the support.

“It’s humbling to know that they know I’m
just trying to bring energy to the team,” he
said. “I’m glad I can bring energy to them,
which also brings energy to the team.”

Rivers said he’s been a leader for the
team. '

“I may not get the opportunity out there
physically, but vocally,” Rivers said. “I know
what Coach Dixon wants, and I can kind of
relay that to them from a player perspec-
tive.” ; I

From his time as a student—manager to
ﬁnishing his career with Pitt basketball as
a walk-on this season, Rivers said he never
felt like an outsider. He’s been “one of the
guys-” ‘

He might have had the opportunity to
play basketball at a lower level, but he said
he didn’t play in the AAU circuit and wasn’t
recruited. When looking for a university, he
applied to Pitt and Arizona State.

He wanted a new experience, so he moved

“There are people who have done sailboat
racing before, and then there are people like
me, who have been on sailboats plenty of
times but have no idea how to race a sailboat,
to people who have only seen sailboats and
thought it would be really cool to learn how

_ to- do it,” Anderson said. “The goal is to get

everyone licensed through US Sailing.”

Much of the group, Mattiola said, con-
sists of curious, inexperienced students
how hooked on sailing thanks to the weekly
meetings.

“We have a large portion of the club that
has never set foot on a sailboat before, or
maybe did it once,” he said. “The majority
of our club is people who have very little ex-
perience and are just interested-in learning
about the sport.”

Over 100 people signed up for the club’s
mailing list when the club formed, and about

20 to 30 people showup for Thursday meet— .

ings in the Cathedral. Mattiola said that
membership dues and other private fund-
ing have been considered for the club, as
everything but transportation costs is paid
out-of—pocket. - ‘
Anderson noted that the group tried to
raise funds this winter by selling popcorn."
“It went not the best, but that’s okay,”
she said. “We made a little bit of money, and

I we’re working on ways to [raise money] .”

Expenses go beyond just sailboats.

Despite the devotionﬂof active members
at Pitt, the city itself is not currently a sailing
hub. Mattiola and Anderson said that not
much sailing takes place in the region.
“They’ve held a couple of sailboat races
in Pittsburgh in the past where people have
come and brought their boats,” Anderson
said. “But not a whole l‘otTofs’ailing happens
A The club, though, believes that sailing
can thrive at the Point, where river currents
do not prevent racing and water depth and
boat trafﬁc are favorable. The club hopes
that a ﬂeet of boats and a sailing program
can operate out of the location, and it is
coordinating with the Point” of Pittsburgh
Sailing League to reach that goal.

and she’s becoming a really solid hitter.”

Like King — who broke the Pitt school
record for wins in a season for a pitcher with
the help of Sevilla’s home run against the
Huskies — Sevilla grew upin southern Cali-
fornia before deciding to play at Pitt. .

“I just wanted to get away from Califor-
nia,” the San_Diego native said of her decision
to play college softball over 2,000 miles away
from home. “The campus is beautiful, the city
is beautiful and the‘ coaches are awesome. I
couldn’t be happier here at Pitt.”

Four Panthers —— Sevilla, King, junior
catcher Holly Stevens and senior outﬁeld-
er Yvette Bravo ~— are originally from the
Golden State, but Sevilla said that number
might rise with the addition of next year’s

‘recruiting class.

“ “I think we have a few more California
girls joining the program next season,” she
said. “You can play softball year-round there,

"and that develops a lot of talented girls.”

Bravo saidthat she believes Sevilla’s
patience and ability to provide timely hits

makes her an important ﬁgure in the future

of Pitt softball. . -

“She’s a really clutch hitter. She sees the
ball well and gets a lot of walks, and she’s a
huge asset to this team,” Bravo said. “She

‘has three more years, too, and she is going

to continue to shine.”I

‘ “Just try to be on time for everything,”
he said. “’Cause if you’re late, it can throw
off your whole day. just making sure you’re
very punctual in what you do. Stay up late,

sacriﬁce some sleep. You can’t. have the .

luxury of sleep.” _ -

In his last day with the Panthers, Rivers
played four minutes and saw time in the
ﬁrst half as Pitt defeated Washington State
to win the College Basketball Invitational
Championship. Former Pitt guard Ashton
Gibbs said that Rivers earned every minute
of his playing time.

“He works ‘hard every day in practice.
He’s one of those guys who never complains
about anything,” Gibbs said after the game.
“He goes out with the rest of the guys just like

nervous and intimidated by meeting a room
full of Division I athletes. Looking back, she
shouldn’t have worried.

“I didn’t,know what they would be like,

if they would be like, ‘Who’s this girl? Why a

are you here?’” she said. “But they were

perfect.” ‘ .
She thought that she might get treated

differently-since she was a walk-on, and

Brizzi said. “He comes’ to games  Even
though I don’t play, he’ll call me after games.
He’ll saywe didn’t_do this well, and we did
this well.’’ ‘ .

Brizzi, who averaged 17 points as a se-
nior at Fauquier High School in Virginia,
could’ve played Division III or low~Division
II basketball, but she decided her nursing
career cameﬁrst. If a spot on a basketball
roster came along with her school choice,
that was just- a plus.

- basketball wasn’t
seamless. Brizzi had to adjust to the Divi-

sion I game and was shocked at the speed of ‘

practices. She said the chance to play with‘
Division I athletes has improved her game
immensely. ‘

Since she wasn’t recruited, Brizzi didn’t
come to Pitt with a pr_e-built relationship
with the coaching staff. There was a long
list of people for Brizzi to meet, but she said

‘the coaching staff really made an effort to '

reach out to her. She’s met with Berenato to

discuss subjects beyond basketball.

“[The meeting] was about if I was happy,

how ‘I was feeling, how my classes were go-
ing, how many family was,” she said. “They
really made an effprt to make it about me
more than basketball, and that was awe-
some.” , .'
As she works toward her goal of becom-
ing a physician’s assistant, much of Brizzi’s
college career isn’t about basketball. She
joined the team late,‘ so her schedule last
semester wasn’t arranged around practices.
In order to keep a spot on the roster, she gave
up a lot of her free time, study time and, she
added with a laugh, nap time.

“I just had "to really work on everything, 1-

like practice, going to class and getting-my
studying in,” Brizzi said. “The coaching staff
and my teammates have all been supportive.
Sometimes I have to be late or miss because
my class schedule is inﬂexible.”

Most of Brizzi’s classes now take place
in the morning, and, like the other athletes
on the team, she has 12 hours of study time
per week that she checks in for. All of the
balance between academics and athletics
comes without the athletic scholarship
money given to her teammates, but Brizzi
said she’s just happy to have the opportunity
to keep playing basketball.

“If my skills were as good as my team-

‘ mates, [the coaches] wouldn’t be like, ‘Oh,

she’s just as good, but she’s a walk—on so we’re
not going to play her,”’ Brizzi said. “I’m just
not as good as everyone else, so that’s why
I’m not playing.” I

season.
Biggest Disappointment: Closerjoel Han-

. rahan

While “Hammer Time” is 1-0 with two
saves in as ‘many opportunities, he has
walked six batters in ﬁve innings. That’s
something a closer just can’t do.= Sooner
or. later it’s going to cost him, especially
with the Pirates playing so many one—run
games.

Batting

Grade: D . ’

The Buccos are last in the league in runs,

batting average-, on-base percentage and
slugging percentage. If this hadn’t been such

a COITIIIIOH OCCLIITEHCB over the past lIWO~

decades, that stat line would be more dis-
turbing. While they have already faced ﬁve
of the best pitchers-in the NationalLeague,
the Pirates are still lacking a big bat in the
middle of the lineup, causing them to scratch

' and claw for every run.

Top Performer: Center ﬁelder Andrew
McCutchen

Mccutchen has set out to prove he was
worth the big contract the Buccos gave him

prior to this year, ‘and he has carried the of- '

fense far. He is fourth in the National League
with a .-377 batting average and a nice on-

' base plus slugging average over .850.

.>Recei’ve a meal stipends

>Get- a free t-shirt

Biggest Disappointment: Third baseman
Pedro Alvarez ’

The Pirates are hoping that Alvarez can
evolve into the middle-of—the-lineup threat
that they desperately need, but so. far it’s
not going well. Besides his 2-4, two: RBI

. night Saturday against the Cardinals, he
H only has two hits — both solo home runs

—— in over 30 at—bats. On top of that, he has

walked just once, has struck out a team-high

15 times and continues to struggle against

left-handed pitchers.

both pitched very well so far this year. How-
ever, new shortstop Clint Barmes has been
dreadful at the plate and in the ﬁeld. Catcher
Rod Barajas has offered little of the pop at ,
the plate that was advertised. *-

Overall Team Grade: C+

Overall, the Pirates still have reason to
be hopeful. They have proven they can win
one—run games, something the team has
struggled with in the past; If the pitching
staff continues to perform well and play-
ers 'such as Alvarez and second baseman
Neil Walker start hitting, the team could yet
surprise fans. However, if they remain the
worst offensive team in the league, it will be
another long summer in Pittsburgh. %
