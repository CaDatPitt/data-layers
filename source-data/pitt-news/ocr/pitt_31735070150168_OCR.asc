Senior Gordon Louderback won the
Student Government Board presi-
dency Thursday night in an elec-
tion cycle that saw a historically high
number of votes.

Thirty percent of Pitt’s non—Col-
lege of General Studies undergrad-
uates voted, electing Louderback
with 2,956 votes. Opposing candi-
date Natalie Rothenberger received
2,307 votes. This year’s election saw
a 6 percent increase from last year’s
voter turnout of 24 percent.

Chairwoman Annie Brown was
modest about the increase in voter
turnout.

“People always congratulate
the Elections chair, but I didn’t do
anything —— it was entirely the can-
didates,” she said.

SGB —— composed of eight Board
members and a president —— is re-
sponsible for allocating the $2.3
million Student Activities Fund to
student organizations.

Undergraduate students voted

online and at various campus polling‘

Thursday with the option of voting
for one presidential candidate and
up to ﬁve Board members. Sixteen

candidates vied for the Board mem— -

ber positions and two candidates
ran for president.

The 2012-2013 Board members, '

listed in the order of the number of
votes received, are Amelia Brause,
Thomas]abro,]ohn Cordier, Michael
Nites, C.]. Bonge, Sowmya Sanapala,
Sarah Winston and David Rosenthal.

In addition to allocating funds
to student organizations, Board
members work to better Pitt with the
completion of the three initiatives,
or projects,‘that were included in
their campaigning platforms. Some

3 candidates, who were in support of

each others’ initiatives, chose to run
together on slates.

The Forbes and Fifth slates were
elected in their entirety, along with
Nites from the Steel slate, Sowmya
Sanapala from the Stone slate and
Rosenthal from the Pitt United slate.

Louderback said he was proud of '

his running mates and all who par-
took in the campaigning, owing his
success to his campaign manager,
supporters, family and friends.
Sixty or so people gatheredin

Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt
Union Thursday night and anx-
iously awaited SGB Elections Chair
Annie Brown’s announcement of
the results. Tensions ran high as 9
p.m. rolled around, and Brown took
the stage to announce the names
of the elected members to a series
of cheers, tears, applause and ﬁst
pumps by the crowd. The newly
elected and newly rejected shared
hugs and congratulations with their
fellow candidates, campaign mem-

bers and supporters.

Before the results, independent
candidate Lauren Barney said that
no matter what the election’s out-
come, it would not be the end of
her involvement with SGB. Rothen-
berger agreed, saying that all will
stay involved and that students and
the University remained the focus
throughout the campaigning pro-
cess.

“We all agreed that no matter
what happened, that at the end of
the day, this was all for Pitt,” Rothen-
berger said after congratulating
Louderback on his win. “I will not
be disappearing.” .

The campaigning process, which

saw multiple ﬁled complaints that
were later withdrawn, had students
putting up ﬂiers, passing out_T-shirts
and dancing to music in front of the
Union leading up to the nighttime
announcement.

- Brown said the day was “emo-
tionally turbulent,” but that strong

‘emotions were to be expected as the

election cycle neared its end.
“I couldn’t have asked for a more

exciting election,” she said. “It inten— I

siﬁed near the end, but with such a
high caliber of people, competitive-
ness was to be expected.” ,
Current Allocations Chair and
newly elected Board member Mi-
chael Nites said that while the results

were “bittersweet,” he is glad that
students have given him the oppor-
tunity to work with the new Board
and make changes around campus.

“For all of those people who
thought my initiatives were infea-
sible, we’ll see,” he said.

The newly elected Board will as-
sume their positions in January at
the start of the new term, and Loud-
erback said he is looking forward to
getting started as their president.

“First and foremost, I want to
have a great transition between
the current Board and the newly
elected,” he said. “I’m just so ex-
cited to get started and make some
progress.” I

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

  How to survive the last month of the
semester Without losing your cool

" Claire Eckroate
l Columnist

V The results are in. Based on the

general vibe acquired from casual
‘ small talk and repeated grumbling,
‘ it seems as though this semester
has been pretty terrible and un-
bearably slow for most Pitt stu-
dents. A‘

e W ’5 Actually, considering that this

is my fourth fall semester, I’m go-
ing to go ahead and say that allfall
semesters seem to go this way.

The days get shorter, and the
weather gets colder. I look outside
and realize that it’s nighttime,-but
my computer claims it’s barely
[time for dinner. My productivity
then tanks: I’m thinking of the
lack of groceries in my kitchen,
the three meetings I’m supposed
to attend, that paper I have due
tomorrow. It’s miserable: I have
more time than I think ‘I do._

The weather has been weird
this year. Cold and autumnal one
day, then a high of 70 degrees the
next. My sinuses are less than
thrilled with typical erratic Pitts-
burgh weather. But in general, I
can’t say that I enjoy having to
add an extra layer of clothing or
a thicker jacket as the semester
progresses. '

The fall semester is hard in
terms of students adapting. For
freshmen, it’s an awkward time
of meetingnew people and get-
ting acclimated to the world that

I is Oakland. For upperclassmen, it’s

like we’ve come out of a summer of
ocean-front hibernation or maybe
a serious 9-to-5 internship. Either
way, it always seems hard to dive

back in to our typical course load.

You just have _.to make it until
fall break. Oh, and then all of the
-p_rojects and papers are. happen-

ing. —Wait, now it’s Thanksgivivng, _

andour measly break is going

to involvehomework, no matter

what. And then it’s the last push

before ﬁnals. - I r
. ‘Yikes. .

Just thinking about the logistics
of this fall‘ semester, or reallyany
fall semester, is making me feel
a little queasy.-We have to com-

batthis sluggish mood that has

invaded our residence» halls and
inﬁltrated the once—happier streets
of South Oakland. . '
Take breaks. This is a danger-
ous tactic, I am well aware: But
allow yourself to catch up on last
week’s “Modern Family” after ﬁn-
ishing the assignments thatyou
absolutely must turn in tomorrow.
This does not mean you can
let yourself slip into a “Downton
Abbey” marathon on_ Netﬂiic,

though. Keep it modest and rela-’
tively brief. It’s just supp'osed,to«

be a quick break, not a'iﬁve-hour

‘ . commitment.

Get some sleep. I know, ’tis the
season for staying in Club Hillman

until it closes. But everyone knows '

thatiour bodies perform better
when well rested, and it helps the
immune system during a time of
year when everyone seems to have
a head cold they can’t shake.

Take a nap if you have to. Just
make sure you set an alarm, oth-
erwise your chances of waking
up on the same day will certainly
decrease.

See your friendsll am guilty '

of not doing enough of this. Make

plans to get dinner with your
friends. Use some of your din-
.ing dollars and swipes or cook in
someone’s apartment to save a few
extra dollars around the holidays.

Then you can go to the library
or wherever you prefer to do your
schoolwork together. You’ll have
already caught up over dinner, so
there’s really no excuse for you to
be distracted and chatty through-
out your study session. By the way,
no Facebook chat allowed. That is
way too dangerous.

“Treat Yo Self.” Going along
with the mantra from NB C’s “Parks
and Recreation,” sometimes we
have to splurge on ourselves after
a rough week. Whether it’s buying
the venti-sized drink from Star-
bucks or participating in some
serious online shopping, you

‘probably deserve it after those

all-nighters you endured for your

_writing-intensive class. ’

If you need further justiﬁca-
tion, just consider it your present
to yourselffor the holidays.

Even if the‘ semester was a
cakewalk for you, it doesn’t mean
that you should not be granted the
opportunity to enjoy yourself or
have _a fun Friday night.-Maybe it’s
a preemptive “treat yo self” before
your academically rigorous spring
semester hits. Maybe it’s an ex-
cuse to further enjoy the last three
weeks of the semester with friends.

Whatever it is, just tell yourself
that you deserve it. As long as you

. don’t go too far overboard or do

anything crazy, like maxing out
your credit card, future you will
appreciate it. I A . P

With the fall and winter sports
seasons beginning to overlap,
there’s a lot going on in Pitt ath-
letics right now.

The men’s basketball team is
the talk of campus after its strong
start, but there are also several
other squads hoping to _either
ﬁnish or begin their respective
seasons on positive notes.

Here’s a rundown of the Pitt
sporting events taking place dur-
ing the next few days:

over Villa'n'ova' in a must—win

Jeremy Tepper

After lambasting Lehigh on Tuesday,
the undefeated Pitt men’s basketball
team wants to continue its impres-
sive start with another victory.

In search of its fourth consecu—_

tive win at the start of this season,
Pitt willwelcome Oakland University

(Mich.) to Oakland, Pittsburgh, when ~

the Panthers (3-0) host the Golden
Grizzlies (1-2) at the Petersen Events
Center this Saturday at 7 p.m. The
game can be viewed online at Wat-

,chESPN.com.

The Panthers have dominated
their ﬁrst three opponents, winning
the games by an average margin of 31
points. Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
says that his squad has improved
greatly in the past few weeks.

“It’s‘been a good week for us,”
Coach Dixon said after the Lehigh
game. “We went eight straight days,
had a day off prior to that. And we’ve
gone about — without breaking
NCAA rules — 15 of 16 days. And
we’ve gotten much better during that
time period.”

Now Pitt will hope to stay on the

_ right track with avictory over a strug-

gling Oakland team.

Usually one of the better teams in
the mid-major Summit League, head
coach Greg Kampe’s Grizzlies have
lost two of their ﬁrst three games.
Oakland is still trying to replace the
recently graduated Reggie Hamilton,
who was last season’s top scorer in
the nation at _25.7 points per game.

knocking off Robert Morris, Seton
Hall and Villanova.

The match is scheduled to start
at 7 p.m. on Friday at the Al Mc-
Guire Center.

Wrestling ’

The No. 18 Pitt wrestling team
travels to Columbus, Ohio, this
weekend to battle the No. 5 Ohio
State Buckeyes in what will be
one of the biggest nonconfer-
ence matches of the season for
the Panthers.

After suffering a heartbreak-
ing 16-15 loss to No. 13 Michigan
last week, Pitt (0-1) will hope
to have more success in its sec-

But this season’s Grizzlies boast a
more balanced offensive attack, with
four players averaging at least 13.7
points per game.]unior guards Duke
Mondy and Travis Bader lead the
team in scoring, averaging 19.3 and

. 18.7 points per game, respectively.

Pitt freshman James Robinson
will likely get the job of guarding one
of the two, and Coach Dixon has high
praise for his young point guard’s
defensive abilities.

“[Robinson] is deceptively ath-
letic. He’s got good size, he’s smart,
he’s tough,” Dixon said. “It’s very rare
to have a freshman who can defend
as he can.”

Pitt point guard Tray Woodall
must also play well defensively if

‘ Pitt plans on containing Oakland’s

talented backcourt, but, Dixon is
conﬁdent in his team’s seniorleader.

“I think he’s going to make this
team a great defensive team. It starts
with him,” Dixon said of Woodall.

Although Oakland’s offense has
been explosive, its defense has lagged
behind this season.

The Grizzlies allow 80 points per
game, and the Panthers should have
no problem exploiting this weakness.

Possessing a deeplscoring attack,
Pitt has averaged 81 points per game, A

‘ with Woodall and junior forward

Talib Zarma both scoring about 16
points per game.

_ Zanna has been the Panthers’
most improved player early this
season, mostly due to his improved
mid-range game and ﬁnishing ability.‘

“I jusfworked on that during the
summer, staying in the gym and just

ond showdown againsta Big 10

. school. The match beginssunday .

at2 p.m.
Women’s Basketball
Coming off an impressive 75-
50 win over Siena College last
Tuesday afternoon in which the

Panthers (2-1) boasted a balanced

scoring attack with four play-
ers in double ﬁgures, Pitt’s next
matchup is against Northeastern
Conference—foe Wagner (0-1).
Junior forward Asia Logan,
who is averaging 20.7 points
and 9.3 rebounds per game, will
look to help extend Pitt’s winning .
streak to three games. Tipoff is

Panthers want to build onsolid startagainst Oakland

practicing on my mid—range and post
moves,” Zarma said. ' 3

Besides Woodall and Zanna, sev-
eral other Pitt players have made key
offensive contributions. Eight players
have averaged at least four points per
game, including junior forward J.J.
Moore and freshman center Steven

Adams with 12.3 and nine points per ‘

game, respectively. ' _

. Pitt’s depth is a key strength, and
against Lehigh, everybody contrib-
uted. '

’ “Everyone played Well — all 10
of our guys,” Dixbn said.

The reason Dixon has seemed
so pleased with Pitt’s ﬁrst three per-
formances is because the Panthers
are excelling in the two facets of the
game that their coach loves most:
defense and rebounding. Pitt has
out-rebounded its opponents by
14 boards per game, while holding
opposition to .a mere 51 points per
game.

Woodall said that the coaches
have stressed defense this year.

“We preach defense now,” the
senior point guard said.

After Oakland, the Panthers’ next
game comes against No. 5 Michigan
on Wednesday, Nov. 21.

With a prime—time matchup
against the University ‘of Michigan
Wolverines at Madison Square Gar-
den in New York City looming, Pitt
must avoid overlooking Oakland.

“We’ll have Thursday and Friday
to prepare for Oakland, and I think
we’ll be ready to go Saturday. That
[Michigan] game is eight days away,”
Dixon said. I

Resembling Wayne Enterprises on the
outside and Hogwarts School of Witch-
craft and Wizardry on the inside, this
40-story tower is the ﬁrst image-_ that
comes to most people’s minds when they
think of Pitt. The Gothic architecture
makes everything you do in or around the
Cathedral feel grand. The only drawback
is that the Nationality Rooms are so pret-

and the seats‘ are (sometimes literally)
made of stone. .

My bed is by far the best napping place.
My bed has been hailed as the king of

It has no less than six pillows of varying

a goose down comforter that weighs so
much you could suffocate underneath it if
you’re not careful. Once you’ve napped in

Best keg: Natural Light
A sweating keg of Natty Light is a fa-

nights. It’s cheap, and it does its job for

quench an of—age student’s thirst at a
house party for quite as cheap as Natty
Light can.

Tradition: "Sweet Caroline"
Played between the third and fourth
quarters of Pitt Football games at Heinz
Field, Neil Diamond’s hit gets the entire
stadium on its feet, “reachin’ out.” So
even if the football team is sure to lose
the game, “Sweet Caroline” is a time
when students can put the hopelessness
aside for a. few minutes. Unfortunately,
the tradition also leads to a majority of
students leaving after the song ends.

questions remain after a freaky spring

Vietnamese: Pho Van Vietnam-
ese Noodles and Grill

One of the most stylish eateries in the
Strip District, Pho Van specializes in tra-
ditional Vietnamese cooking and is BYOB.
The minimalist, tropical-themed decor
is subtle enough not to feel kitschy and,
most importantly, doesn’t take away from
the,amazing pho, spring rolls and other
Vietnamese specialties offered at low pric-
es.

This local eatery has a vast menu featuring
a wide variety of foods. For busy students,
hospital workers or University personnel,
Oishii Bento has a‘ prime off—campus loca-

sphere. For those-looking to experience
something replicative of authentic hum-
mus, grape leaves and falafel, Ali Baba has
both lunch and dinner menus to accom-
modate diners. The good service accom-
panies the delicious menu, bringing some
of the Middle East to Oakland.

Editors’ pick! Salem’s Halal Meats and
Groceries

Hall-price menu: Fuel 8. Fuddle
The consistently long wait outside of Fuel
8: Fuddle’s doors proves that students love
this late-night eatery more than any oth-
er. Serving half-priced food after 11 p.m.,
Fuel 8: Fuddle feeds hoards of hungry din-
ers coming from work, the library and
other, less savory, places. From burgers
to pizzas — such as the quirky smashed
potato and ﬂying buﬁ"alo pies — the menu
says it all: Good food is best served after
dark.

Reslauram‘ for a dale: Union

Grill

Oakland lacks many romantic places for
couples, but Union Grill has a nice atmo-
sphere that can turn a mediocre date into
a delicious meal. Expect to spend a little
more here, but the price is worth a great
night.

The

Restaurant ‘for
Porch

There’s a reason why the Porch at Schen-
ley has ample seating outdoors and a
walk-through window that suits the res-
taurant’s name. It’s situated beautifully
between the bustling college campus and
the tranquil Schenley Park. The Porch is
an attractive location for student—and—
parent banter when coupled with tasty
dishes, a slightly more upscale ambience
and a wide variety of alcoholic beverages.

 Panera Bread 

When a bakery cafe can ‘combine nutri-
tionally savvy meals, ample room to study
and_ free Wi—Fi Internet access, the shop is
simply catering to student’s needs in the

“fmostidelicious way. As Pitt gears up for
the annual chilling change in weather, it’s
no wonder why Panera Bread becomes

ﬁlled with a constant ﬂow of warm soup
and productive laptops. If you plan to stay
awhile, don’t forget the very generous
drink reﬁll policy. _

Coffee: Dunkin’ Donufs

In an era of commercial coffee shop bat-
tles and general snobbism relating to the
topic of caffeine pick-me-ups lies an un-

dercover hero that disguises itself as a’

donut shop. Fortunately for us,’ theisecret
is out that Dunkin’ Donuts reliably brews
some of the most ﬂavorful and rich-tast-
ing coffee on Forbes Avenue. Besides,
sometimes coffee just tastes better with a
traditional sugary-sweet pastry to satisfy
your palette. ’

Wings: Quaker Sfeak & Lube
Quaker Steak & Lube is famous for its
wings but with good reason. If you’re dar-
ing, you can try their atomic sauce — as
long as you sign a medical waiver ﬁrst.
With more than 20 sauce choices to
slather all over some wings, Quaker Steak
knows all things wings.

Editors’ pick: Pizza Romano

Vegetarian: Red Oak Cafe

Cute and informal Red Oak Cafe offers a
wide selection of healthy and fresh vege-
tarian options when another cheese pizza
or frozen veggie burger just won’t cut it.
Red Oak strives to provide a variety of
options to diners. David Gancy, the co-
owner of Red Oak Cafe, recently said that,
“healthy [eating] is more than a trend —
it is a way of life.” ’
Editors pick: Quiet Storm

Vegan: Red Oak Cafe

Red Oak Cafe has several vegan options,
including a rice-and-beans plate with
vegan chili and a veggie blue plate. The
restaurant, which has decorations de-
picting Pittsburgh’s past, is also willing to
accommodate any other vegan requests.
For Red Oak Cafe, dining shouldn’t be a
challenge.
