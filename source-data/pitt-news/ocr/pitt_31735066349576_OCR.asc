 Tenure Review

FAS Pla

VBY RICH HARRY ’

The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) yesterday passed a
motion calling on. FAS Dean
Jerome Rosenberg to appoint a
committee to draft a proposal
improving the present system of
awarding tenure.

The motion passed 77-25 at a
special FAS meeting.

' The motion, proposed by .Tenure _
1”‘ ,and Promotion Review Board
"‘°“’ member Irwin Schulman, consists

of recommendations for guidelines

for appointment to tenured rank,
procedures to be followed by the
FAS clean in reviewing recommen-
dations for tenure, the rights of
candidates for tenure and mechani-
sms appropriate for protecting
those rights. '
The proposal also prescribes
procedures and roles of FAS and
the several departments involved
in decisions concerning tenure. An
amendment to the motion instructs ,
the committee to institute proce-

Qxdures to “maximize openess and

faculty involvemen_t in the tenure-
awarding procedure, and to im-
prove the quality of the faculty.”

The committee is to be composed
of the Dean of the College of Arts
and.Sciences, the associate Dean

wNon-Renewal .

The sociology chairman yester-
day released a brief explanation for
the department's decision not to
renew assistant professor Paul
Nyden’s contract.

Chairman Burkart Holzner, in a
letter to Nyden, said the complete
report of a review committee will
be sent to Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg.

If the report is to be released in
its entirety, Rosenberg will have to
issue it, Holzner said.

“Holzner told me I would never
see that repoert,” Nyden said. “I
still definitely want to see it. If it’s
released as a private report to me,
Hi make it public; show it to
anyone.”

Nyden said he believes the
department is doctoring the report.
“I'm sure it’s not for public
consumption, that's why it’s taking
so long," he said. ‘

S CATH Keeps Support }‘

Despite SGB Split _

- BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

The Pitt College Young Demo-'
cra'tst (CYD) is the only ‘student
organization to officially withdraw
its support fromi the Student
Coalition Against ‘Tuition Hikes
(SCATH) since the Student Gov-
ernment Board (SGB) acted simi-
larly last Thursday.

The CYD is one of 13 student

organizations that agreed on‘

February 26 to formally endorse
SCATH.
“Tuition hikes can be avoided
only through actions such as
University administration cost cut-
backs and lobbying congressmen in
Harrisburg,” CYD president Ken
Scott said about the decision.
. “The SCATH‘ policy of issuing

, generalized statements demanding

the ‘right to education’ just 'isn’t
going to work,” Scottsaid.
‘ The.'CYD, also decided to work

closely -with SGB in contacting

congressmen“ in Harrisburg.

Union ‘Runoff: 

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY - 

All the cards are face up for the ‘
Provost area runoff in the faculty"
union question at Pitt. The
Pennsylvania State Education ‘As-_i
sociation (PSEA) has moved to
support the Pitt Professional Union”
(_PPU) in its bid to become the sole
bargaining agent for Provost area,
faculty. ' A

NEWS ANALYSIS

The American Association 
University Professors (AAUP) has '
declined to support the ' PPU,
officially at least, until the runoff
election tally demonstrates how”
faculty members feel about collec-
tive bargaining. A

PPU president Van Beck Hall has-._.—
' pledged to take the PPU campaign“ t
to the individual members of the”-;
AAUP, and perhaps that will téll ~
the _ﬁnal story for this campaign.“

The AAUP membership was
badly split on the issue of collective’
bargaining, and that. dissension
probably cost it- the 12 crucial votes;
needed to top the PPU and take the
runner-up slot in the March;
runoffs. ' M 

Many claimed the PPU victory,
over the AAUP was more than
partly dependent on’ the former’s
organizing drive. This sléill will be ,
of critical importance in the PPU 5'"
drive to gather enough votes‘ to .top
any anti-union sentiment, the same fl .
sentiment that took 48% of the
votes cast in this month’s initial,
Provost area elections. _

Defections from the AAUP ranks ‘
will be the biggest plus for the PPU- 
campaign. Some AAUP members? 
may have difficulties accepting the - i
philosophy of ‘the PPU, but the
PPU’s “troika” proposal may be ' I
enough to defuse fears “of the A

The Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes (SCATH) rally
planned for today has been
postponed due -to dwindling stu-
dent support and the recent
Student Government Board (SGB)
split from SCATH.

Coalition members at Monday
evenings’ SCATH meeting voted
not to hold the rally. Instead,
SCATH members decided their
thrust must be toward education
during the remainder of the term.

“While petitioning and talking to
students, I learned that most of
 Q them feel the ﬁght against tuition

hikes is hopeless,” SCATH mem-
ber Steve Weiner said.
- Several petitioners mentioned
they are unable to answer many of
the students’ questions about the
tuition increase issue. ,
SCATH members agreed they
need to formulate answers to these
' questions and organize a deﬁnite
plan of action because students are
turned off by vaguery. .
“We must education students
about the tuition issue,” SCATH
member Larry ‘Chaban said..
“SCATH must determine how a
tuition hike affects the entire
..,.._ community, not just the blacks and
’TfT;.¥women.” '

Coalition members also talked
about the recent SGB split from’
SCATH. '

SCATH members voted at Monday’s meeting to postpone a rally

originally scheduled for today.

“Only the group which gets
mass student support can legiti-
mately speak for the students,”
Chaban said.‘

According to SCATH member
Ellen Lupowsky, the SGB is not
creating avenues for student
involvement. = I

“SGB is trying to function
without student input,” Lupowsky

said. “They think their title allows .

Nyden Informed Of
Department's Decision

In this letter I must advise you of

recommend that your contract not
be renewed.

The department, following its
normal procedures, considered
your teaching, research and schol-
arship, administrative activities,
and community service. The focus
of our attention was ‘ on your
professional development during
the time of your employment at the
University of Pittsburgh. .As a
prefatory remark let me say that we
are both disappointed and sadden-
ed that the promise that "we
perceived in you and which served
as the basis for our hiring you in
the first instance was not fulﬁlled.

.{?A

After careful examination of your
recent scholarly work, the ‘faculty
judges it to be below the minimum
level of performance we require of
an assistant professor in our
department. V ’ '

The faculty found that although
you were able to arouse enthusias-
tic response in some students, for
other students your performance
was of average or even lesser
quality. We recognize-that the

 Noon

evaluation of teaching is always a
difﬁcult task but we did not ﬁnd
that your performance as a teacher
of undergraduates was so out-
standing as tocompensate for other
deﬁciencies. . - «

Also your administrative work in
the -department was not of such
quality as to serve as a strong
argument for reappointment.

The faculty took into considera-
tion your interest in the labor
movement and your‘ work on- its
behalf. However, no amount of
time and energy invested in such
community efforts can- serve as a
substitute for meeting the basic
scholarly standards our department
requires. - ‘

In summary our evaluation of all ,

your activities: your teaching,

‘research, administrative work and

service to thecommunity are such
that we cannot recommend your
reappointment to the Dean.

We are aware that you would like
more detailed information pertain-
ing to the reasons for the decision.

abandoning other, prior commit-
ments,” Schulman said. “It would
be pointless for us to pass a
resolution that the Dean as Dean
would ﬁnd unacceptable.‘ Dean
Rosenberg can, of course, speak for
himself on this issue, but it seems
obvious the. present proposahis not
one he can properly accept.”

Simmonds, however,‘ indicated

b in his proposal that such compli-

ance on Rosenberg’s part’ was
- “voluntary.”

Schulman also maintained there,

were a number of flaws in
Simmond’s proposal which made it
impossible for him to support it.

He cited as. one example the
requirement of the Dean to review
all tenure decisions without beneﬁt
of advice,» since the proposal

abolishes the present system of,

.review by ad hoc committees
without providing a replacement.

“In some ways, this is the most
remarkable feature of this propo-
sal,” Schulman commented. “It
suggests that the less advice the
Dean receives, the better his
decision will be.”

“By abolishing the ad hoc
committee as-part of tenure-mak-

» ing decisions,” Simmonds said, “it
' leaves the Dean free to consult

opinions of anyone he wants.”

SCATH Chooses New Route

(Continued from Page 1)

The troika proposal, widely
circulated by the PPU before and
after the initial Provost area
elections on March 9 and 10,
provices for a collective bargaining
caucus with proportionate repre-
sentation of the PPU, AAUP and
PSEA.

Now, according to Hall, that
proportion is based on the results
‘of the March 9 and 10 election. The
PPU would act as a front
organization, since state labor law
requires one and only one exclusive
bargaining agent, a and present
proposals drawn up» by all three
union ‘organizations.

Hall commented that the terms
of the troika agreement would have
to be renegotiated following a‘.PPU
victory in the runoff election.

One question that arises con-

cerns how the AAUP and PSEA-_

leadership will view the troika
agreement and what impact it
might have on the character of
negotiations.

Both the PSEA and the AAUP

have publicly and privately stated
they intend to remain organized on
campus in the event the PPU loses
the runoff ‘election. State law
requires that a petition for another
round of union elections cannotbe
ﬁled within a year of completionof
the current procedures. » "

That means both the AAUP‘ and
the PSEA are ready to dig in for

The scenario is almost complete‘

the PSEA vote and defectors from’

forces, the Teachers for an

Gabriel.

Three student groups, the
Resident Student Association
(RSA), Gay Students at Pitt (GSP)
andwthe Commuter Association,
expre's.s'ed reservations about the
SGB’s withdrawal from SCATH.
They believe a coalition would be
more effective withstudent groups
working together, as opposed to
competing with each other for
student support.

“I would like to see SGB endorse
a coalition, not work separately
from SCATH,” GSP spokesman
Tom Carroll said. “The SGB
cannot fight a tuition hike and
organize its own activities at the

 One of the most frightening
faspects of modern times is the
-.7 skyrocketing crime rate.

 

Over the past few decades, the
_  tide of lawlessness has risen with
‘ ‘I _ such alarming alacrity that, we are
 fast becoming a people under
, ‘vsiege. While a multitude of factors
'4," -have contributed to this situation,
"  two causes which are‘ readily
__ apparent are liberal court rulings,
 which have given more rights to the
I criminals than to law abiding
citizens, and an antiquated federal
criminal code which hasn’t been
  revamped since 1909.

 

Fortunately, a few lawmakers
have recognized the problem and
have taken an important first step

I’ inattempting a cure. That step is
 embodied in a proposal currently

-under consideration known as

Senate Bill One (S-1), which, if

adopted, ‘will do much to help free
‘ this country from the scourge of
- -crime and moral decay.

Among other things, S-1 will
rearm the federal authorities with
the weapons they need to do battle
‘with organized crime. Broader

I , wiretapping powers will be given.
allowing for closer surveillance of
gangland ﬁgures so that their
,illegal activities can be foiled
before they harm anyone. This
would also result in a higher
conviction rate. Another section of
the bill would neutralize the effects
_. of such Supreme Court decisions as
 Miranda v. Arizona which have
jg _ allowed thousands ,of dangerous
.. felons to go free because of a legal

‘ .. technicality.

But the most useful section will
undoubtedly prove to be the
reinstatement of the death penalty

for major crimes, long known as the

‘. effective deterrent available. With
 C this powerful arsenal, the forces of
. law and order would have a decided

 

 _. fadvantage in the watch crime.

   

I that S-1 should be passed.

Butthis editorial is about garbage. _

j; In the past month, the University has taken janitors off mght turn

’ . ‘. and placed them on daylight shifts in most buildings. As a result,

. many students claim, the quality of custodial care has deteriorated;
E rest rooms are ﬁlthy, ﬂoors aren't mopped or vacuumed and garbage

, Facilities Maintenance Department manager William Acker claims
‘exactly the opposite is true; according to him. the quality Of C‘15t°‘_11-31

S-1 will also take care of
subversives and terrorists. This is
especially heartening in view of the
recent rash of bombing and
kidnappings. It would give new life
to the Smith Act of 1950 which will
help keep close tabs on commun-
ists, dangerous aliens and other
radicals. Moreover, S-1 will
provide stiff penalties for those
who destroy government property
or deliberately interfere with the
orderly workings of our democracy.
his provision will be an effective
tool against terrorist and anarchist
organizations. Penalties for
“narcotics trafﬁcking. would be
increased and those laws would be
more stringently enforced. In
addition, S-1 would prevent angry
crowds at subversive demonstra-
tions from turning into ugly and
dangerous mobs by enacting tough
riot control measures.

Perhaps the most important

portion of the bill is that which will _
impose a long needed dose of,

responsibility on the media. No
longer would muckraking journal-

ists or self-styled crusaders be able ”

to obtain and publish information
on our military capabilities or
intelligence operations. S-1 would
clamp a tight lid on these secrets so
vital to our national survival. the
bill also provides for a stepped up
campaign against obscenity. those
who make their livings by
wallowing in the slime of moral
degeneracy would have to ﬁnd
alternative means of supporting
themselves. Far too long have the
masters of the media hidden
behind the First Amendment while
spewing out streams of mendacity,
perversion and ﬁlth. When S-1 is
enacted, we will once again have a
free press.

This article has dealt only with a
small fraction of the entire bill,
which on the whole will do much to
‘eliminate crime and violence from
our troubled land. but even the few
provisions cited here should
convince most reasonable"'persons

Boredomls NolA Virtue

BY BILL MOORE

There are certain courses at Pitt
that everyone wants to take,
including the -one dealing with
rocks. »

There have been courses in
geology, life sciences, economics,
political science, music, sociology,
and speech that students ﬁght to
get into for one reason or another.
More often than not, though, the
reason is something often referred
to as ‘mickey mousism,’ or the
ability to get a ‘B’ for doing nothing

and an ‘A’ for doing next to ,

nothing. -

BEHIND THE LINES

The word is passed on from term
to term. “Take Crumbleman’s
Geography course, it’s really good.
You don’t even have to show up for
classes.”

Really good, you see, refers not

to the amount of learning done, but

‘the amount of effortlessness

involved.

To try to pin the blame on
someone would be nearly as stupid
as trying to deny the problem
exists. It is nobody’s doing, just a
fact. . _,

There are too many other things
going on from the ages of 18 to 22

but vocal band who disagree.
Naturally, criminals, terrorists, and
smut peddlers are opposed to the
bill. But there is also a growing
movement to confuse the general
public in the hoped. of defeating the
measure. On one hand,.the major
newspaper syndicates and TV
networks have launched a cam-
paign to S-1, as witnessed by a
recent series of articles in the
Pittsburgh Press._

Even more disconcerting, how-
ever, is the growing agitation
against S-1 on the college
campuses. In the forefront of’ this
drive is a group calling itself the
National Committee Against Re-
pressive Legislation. ' It is alleged

and it is a pain to have to forego
some pleasure because of classes.
So, keep the load light and easy, try
to study only during midterms and
ﬁnals, and leave some time for all"
the other things. '

Great, perhaps, from the student
angle. That is, until the student
realizes he isn’t learning anything.

Unions Will Shift

Balance of Power

The University of Pittsburgh is
faced with several problems at the
present time. Some feel the most

impending danger is faculty

unionization. Their arguments de-
serve serious consideration. Union-
ization will bring . many evils.
Among thehworst. are: 1) it will
politicize the university commu-
N nity, whose professional objectivity
and its liberal tradition will be‘
sacriﬁced; 2) it will actively pervert

by which present tenure decisions
are made; and 3) seeing that unions
are by nature syndicalist, their only
real concern will be faculty salaries
and job security - certainly

programs such as Urban Studies,

Black Studies and the Rouen
program (already cancelled), which
are usually protected by the Dean’s
ofﬁce of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences will be in greater
jeopardy. Surely unions by deﬁni-
tion are solely concerned with
naked self-interest.

The fact that some would take
the above seriously shows the sad
state of affairs among some of our
misled colleagues.iIs our university
to be some academic cloister or an
organic part of an urban environ-
ment? How can a university be
devoid of policy directives which
are inherently political? Perhaps
our “liberal” friends do not realize
that “apolitical” too often‘ becomes
the rationalization for support of

the ‘status quo. __ _‘ A ‘

If anyone seriouslyvbelieves’ that
the lack of collective bargaining
renders impartial tenure decisions,
they might consider reading -the
letter on the back of Monday’s Pitt
News by Dr. Michel Roublev. It
seems to uslthat departmental and
general faculty decisions ( i.e.
union decisions) could not be worse
than circumstances which present-
ly prevail. Most of us know. of
students who have been forced to
take a course with a professor
whom they did not_ choose at
registration because their choice
had been precluded from them as a
result of the dismissal of a
non-tenured professor. It is impos-
sible to conceive that certain
departments presently suffer more
than others in terms of tenure
decisions as a result of the attrition
of ﬁnancial resources? Perhaps to
some extent PPU could remedy
this situation.

If one truly believes that unions
have to be syndicalist, he or she is
unaware of the history of world
labor movements. If we remember
correctly, the Urban Studies
program almost got terminated two
years ago, the Rouen program was

the future brings. Did that ominous
group known as the PPU commit
such irresponsible actions? If we
remember correctly, the answer is
no. But“again,.. maybe the PPU
could have an ameliorative effect
on important institutional deci-
sions. '

So who is concerned for
academic freedom, fair tenure
appraisals and innovative educa-
tional programs? Well, we have a
strong inkling aslto whom is not.
There are no deﬁnitive certainties
that the PPU-AFT would always act
in a positive fashion. But the
establishment of the PPU as the
bargaining agent may shift the
b}i,la;n_ce of power to a more
equitable ratio. Presently, the
process of education and the
regulation of education at this
institution are divided and separa-
ted to a dangerously unjust level.

We, with utmost sincerity, wish
the PPU the best of luck in the
upcoming election.

Phillies Will
Win in '76

. THE SPIRIT OF '76
WILL REIGN IN PHILLY...

In regards to the March 19 article
by Yaier Lehrer on the analysis of
the National League Eastern
division, we vehemently disagree
with the choice of the Pittsburgh
Pirates to repeat as the division
champions. We feel that the
Philadelphia Phillies are ﬁnally
going to blossom this season and
overtake the Pirates.

Mr. Lehrer claims, “although
the Phillies pose a deﬁnite title
threat, there is no reason to believe
that the Phillies will upset the
power-hitting Bucs.” Prepare
yourself for some fascinating
statistics. The Phillies outhit the
Pirates (.269-.263), outscored the
Pirates (735 to 712), and were only
13 homeruns shy of the Pirates‘
load. As far as power is concerned,
Gred Luzinski (.300-34 HR-120

. RBI) and Mike Schmidt (38 HR-95

RBI) put together beat the
homerun total of Willie Stargell,
Dave Parker, and Richie Zisk. Add
in a good season by superstar Dick
Allen and....

In the speed category, it is pretty
sad when your leading stealer hit a
whopping .212 for the season. The
Philliers outstole the Pirates
126-49. Case closed.

In the inﬁeld, Dick Allen, Dave
Cash, Larry Bowa, and Mike

Schmidt give the Phils a deﬁnite
advantage over the Pirates. The
only steady __player in the Pirates

Letters

    

indield is Willie Stargell. Rennie
Stennett and Richie Hebner are far
from consistent.

The outﬁelds of the two teams
are both solid with the Pirates
having a slight edge because of
balance. The Pirates have a better
distribution of power between
Parker, Oliver, and Zisk but the
Phillies have excellent talent with
Luzinski, Garry Maddox (.272-50
RBI-25 SB), and Jay Johnstone
(.329-54 RBI). Throw in Ollie
Brown (.300) as a sub ‘and the
Phillies have a trio equal to the
Pirates in everything but home-
runs.

Next in line is the catching.
Granted, Manny Sanguillen is an
all-star at his position but the
Phillies’ catchers are more than
what Mr. Lehrer terms “medio-
cre." Johnny Oates (.282) and Bob
Boone (.246) don’t have much
power but they are consistent
players behind the plate.

Now let’s look at pitching. The
Pirates have a fine starting
rotation with Reuss, Rooker,
Medich, Kison, and Candelaria but
the Phils can easily match this
talent. Contrary to what Mr. Lehrer
says, Steve Carlton and Jim

' Lonborg are far from being over the

hill. Carlton had his problems, but
with the aquisition of Tim:
McCarver, his batterymate during
his years at St. Louis, he has
settled down and should regain a
form near that of his Cy Young
Award-winning season. Jim Lon-
borg was leading the league in
pitching with a 6-1 record when he
was severely injured in a game at
Montreal in mid-May. The long
layoff affected his comeback as he
ﬁnished the year with an 8-6 slate.
The Phillies have two fine

youngsters in 20-year-old Tom
Underwood (14-13) and Larry
Christiansen (11-6) who are both
destined for good seasons this
year. The Phillies have acquired
two excellent pitchers in Jim Kaat
(20-14-3.11 ERA with the White
Sox) and Ron Reed (13-13 with the
Cardinals). This gives the Phillies
three righties and three lefties to
play around with until they ﬁnd a
starting rotation which should
prove to be very productive and
most deﬁnitely consistent.

. As far as the bullpen is
concerned, Pittsburghls is shaky to
say the least. Dave Giusti and
Ramon Hernandez are getting up
in age. Larry Demery, Kent
Tekulve, and Bob Moose are
coming off so-so years, which is all
they have had so far in their
careers. Looking at the Philadel-
phia bullpen, the combination of
Tug McGraw (9-6-2-.97 ERA) and
Tom Hilgendorf (7-3-2.13 ERA)
provide an excellent 1-2 punch and
could prove themselves to be the
best in baseball today. Throw in
Gene Garber, Ron Scheuler, and
Wayne Twitchell and the Phillies
have a tough bullpen staff.

One seemingly strong acquisi-
tion for the Pirates during the
offseason was pitcher Doc Medich
from the Yankees (16-163.51 ERA).
Upon close examination, Medich
doesn’t appear to be capable of
ﬁlling the void left by Ken Brett
and Dock Ellis.

In his article, Lehrer states that,
“the Philliers must make up for
two tremendous weaknesses.” He
claims that the catching is
mediocre at best but we have
shown that Oates, Boone, and
McCarger provide a consistent
rotation behind the plate. The other
weakness that Mr. Lehrer claims is
the starting rotation. The Phillies
have three Cy Young Award
winners on their staff who are
seasoned veterans that are far from
being declared over the hill.
Christiansen and Underwood are

destined to be all-stars and should
have good seasons this year. The
bullpen is far better than “ade-
quate” with McGraw, Hilgendorf,
Garber,.... As far as power is
concerned, the Phillies have the
edge because of their youth.
Stargell and Oliver are getting up

in years.

The Phillies have a better
bullpen, better hitting, better
defense and that all important

aspect, youth. It is time for the
Pirates to move over and let a new
and better-qualiﬁed team take over
the helm of the National League
East. The Phillies will deﬁnitely
win the division this season. The
statistics speak for themselves.

Academic Freedom
Is a Myth

After reading the March 22 issue
of the Pitt News, I realized that
academic freedom at the University
of Pittsburgh is a myth. The
featured article on the front page
was entitled, “Faculty Votes to
Oust Nyden.” It dealt with the
ﬁring of Dr. Paul Nyden of the
sociology department due to his
political views. The dismissal was
supposedly based upon Nyden’s
development as a scholar. How-
ever, it was clear that (there were no
other motives behind the decision
——the proof being the defense
presented in Nyden’s behalf by
several prominent sociologists.

In addition to the front page
article, there was on the back page
an open letter written by Dr.
Michael Roublev of the history
department sponsored as an
advertisement by the Pitt Profes-
sional Union. Roub1ev’s contract
was not renewed by‘ Dean
Rosenberg despite a recommenda-
tion by 19 tenured faculty members
requesting that Roublev be ten-

.ured. Again, the action was purely

po1itical.,Roublev’s views on the
Middle East situation were not
quite as pro-Israel as Rosenberg
would have liked. Also, Roublev
was an original founder of the PPU.

The University of Pittsburgh, as
an institution of higher learning,
should be able to tolerate all

unpopular they may be. To be sure,
it should strive for as much input
from varying ideologies as pos-
sible. The purges must end

Like anylarge institution, the

University of Pittsburgh has a large
bureaucracy which moves at a
snail’s pace and, in many cases, is
unresponsive to its students’
needs. Thie unresponsiveness is
reflected in bureaucratic attitudes
which range from “buckpassing”
to evasive answers of student's
perplexing questions.

There are, of course, exceptions
to these generally disinterested
attitudes. Perhaps the best exam-
ple of this is the Work-Study office,
administered by Debbie Rupert.

This ofﬁce is a shining example of

how responsive a University.&

department can be towards its
students. In dealing with this
department, I received candid
answers to my questions, as well as
Mrs. Rupert’s cooperation in
securing part-time employement.
The University Work-Study de-
partment is truly a model from
which other University sub-sys-
tems should take note and emulate.

HO’S AFRAIDOF THE PPU?   

The PITT NEWS has described the Pitt Professional Union ast a "Pitt-centered” union. We
find this characterization both flattering and accurate. It recognizes that our organization and organ-
izational goals have come out of grass roots PPU faculty involvement in University affairs, including
Senate and Senate Council, over the past six years. '

The founding members of /the Union were concerned with two related problems facing Pitt
faculty in the 70's: 1) the then anticipated and now all to actual erosion of funding for Pitt and other
institutions of higher learning; and 2) the concomitant erosion of faculty rights and-responsibilities in
areas of governance and academic policy.

, The response to these problems we have developed with help from both members and non-
members of the Union is contained in our STATEMENT OFIPOSITIONS. We excerpt below some of
the basic points. We ask faculty and other concerned members of theﬂPitt community to consider
whether they correspond in fact to the anti—union claim that we are out to "bury the collegial model
of the University.” V -

WHAT ARE THE PPU DEMANDS?

—The protection of a formal contract establishing terms and conditions of employ-
ment.

—An annual cost-of-living adjustment inﬁfaculty salaries equal to the annual change
in the consumer price index. * , ‘ 

-— Faculty input and decision in the appointment of Deans, the Chancellor, the Pro-
vostiand regional campus‘ Presidents; faculty involvement in all levels in the de-
termination of budgetary priorities. '

—-Tenure and promotion on the basis of departmental election and recommenda-
tion, subject to review by faculty committees. ELECTED to monitor tenure and fa
their application. ‘

— Recognition of the Senate as a legislative (rather than '_’advisory") body on mat-
ters of academic policy. " ‘ '

—A joint union-administration committee to work on improvement and innovation 
in the area of health insurance and fringe benefits.

\

— Established grievance procedures available to ALL faculty to deal with problems
arising from their employment. . A

—— Attention to student concerns, especially in the matters of tuition, class size, and
program cutbacks. V ‘

—Protection of faculty from "productivity” increases in basic work load. Faculty
and departmental consultation to determine for each individual the precise mix
between basic teaching load, special research or teaching responsibilities, and ad-
ministrative or advising duties.

— Defense of the library and_.other research resources against fiscal erosion.

—An end to the gross inequities that characterize the situation of our colleagues
j in the regional campuses.

—Continued commitment by the University as a whole to implement Affirmative
Action goals, including the establishment of a University-wide child care center.

 

— Faculty effort through our organization to build alliances and a powerful lobby
in Harrisburg to secure continued and expanded support for Pitt and Pennsylvania
colleges and universities in general.

Yet Always Remains ’ln Touch’,f

BY LEE GUTKIND

In retrospect, it’s fair to say that
I might not have invited Herbert
Gold to this, our fourth annual
writers’ conference. I say this with
no ill will meant. _ To
knowledge, Gold is the most
accomplished and articulate writer
to ever participate in a’ literary
conference at Pitt—at least in
relatively recent times. _(Saul
Bellow did address Pitt English
majors in an abbreviated confer-

_ence some 15 years ago.)

Gold is the author of more than a

half dozen novels, including The

Great American Jackpot, Fathers
and Salt, has published volumes of
short stories and essays, taught
writing at the University of
California, Stanford, Cornell and
Harvard, received numerous liter-
ary awards, has had works
published in many ﬁne magazines,
and had his books widely translated
abroad.

  Journalism:   Mostly Formula’

BY BILL MOORE

 Nicholas von. .Hoffman is a

writer. An imaginative one. A
rarity in daily journalism.

“Writing is art, and art is an
individual-type effort,” von Hoff-
man says of one of his professions.

“But journalism is the ability to
master a formula,” he says of the
other. p

“Journalists are forbidden to
give their work the stamp of
individuality. Corporations don’t
want artists, they want people who
are adept at manipulating certains
types of formulae.”

Von,Hoffm'an believes there are
very few good writers on newspa-
pers today—“there are at best 10
or 12”—because the papers are
both against and afraid of good
writing.

“Most people who write for
newspapers are not in the business
for the writing,” Hoffman con-
tinues. “The most distinguished
people in American journalism
today as far as writing is concerned
don’t write for newspapers.”

Two cases in point, according to
von Hoffman, are authors Tom
Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin. Both are
now mainly limited to magazine
pieces and books.

‘ Von Hoffman himself may be the
exception with his work-for The
Washington Post. “I like to think of
myself as an exception, but that is
for other people to decide. It was
very hard for me to gain acceptance
as a writer."

One of the more notable
examples of von Hoffman’s per-
sonal approach to newswriting
appeared in the Post in 1968. Black
civil_rights leader Martin Luther
King had been felled by an
assassin’s bullet, and as one of the
Post’s leading writers, ,von Hoff-
man covered the funeral.

“The Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. led his last march here today.
He was in a cherrywood cofﬁn...,”
his piece began. Hardly the
straight ncws lead.

Television, with it’s far larger
staff and budget, lorced him into
trying‘ something different. “I
assumed everyone who would be
reading it had seen the goddamn
funeral on TV. I decided to describe
it in"very subjective terms.”

Everyone did watch it on TV that
day, including von Hoffman,
because he knew the TV cameras

_could see more in one afternoon
than he could.

It was a good idea, he believed,
to try a different approach, and

 

 

piece overthe objections of some
older, more traditional newspa-

vpermen on the Post news desk.

“But that style has not caught
on, it is not the way newspapers
handle that sort of event. You have
to have a point of view for that type

of writing, a point of view that is '

not a-flat, institutional point of

So why not Herbert Gold at Pitt?
Because I am told by some faculty
members and students Gold's
books aren’t selling as well_ as they
used to, that he is directing his
energies atproblems that no longer
concern us; that the man, very
simply, is out of touch.

But, I can’t buy it. For each time
I read Herbert Gold, he profoundly,
tenderlv. touches me.

No stranger to Pittsburgh, Meredith has served as a poet in
residence at both Camegie-Mellon University and with Pittsburgh’s

International Poetry Forum.

“Pittsburgh is a manageable city and I think the people know the

limits of the town. I found many

arts and I felt at home,”. Meredity says. .
A teacher as well as an artist, Meredith seeks creative exercise in the
classroom as well as in front of a typewriter. ‘

What he teaches of course is poetry and. Meredith takes some-7f

Mereditlfs own poetic style ' is
sparse. The words that strike the

‘iSeIIing7’ Offers Advice, Ideas

for anyone interested in publishing
articles, books and short stories.

Harris is a senior book editor for
Simon and Schuster. She started as
an assistant editor in the college
department of another publishing
company, then applied for her
present position after a few years of
on-the-job experience.

“Being an editor involves
working with creative people, and
working on books in many different
subject areas so that the job is
always interesting and challenging.
You learn to master the craft of
intelligent and productive editorial
skills.”

Besides having an adequate
background in writing, Harris says
being an editor requires several
other basic qualiﬁcations.

 

“Obviously, you need a college
degree,” she said, “but you also
need a certain amount of curiosity,
initiative, persistence, intelligence
and a real interest in books to make
it in the editing field."

Krotz has been an editor at New
Times since July of 1974. Before
that she worked in publicity for
books and for Warner Brothers.
She, too, gets much satisfaction
from her work.

“It’s exciting, particularly when
there's a story that I think is
fascinating and I want people to
read about it,” she said.

One job of an editor is to cater to I
the readership——if the audience is
liberal, the editor must run liberal

Man Cannot LiveBy

Written Word alone

BY DENNIS KELLY
AND GENE GRABOWSK!

“Hold it! Don’t ever become a I

writer without something to fall
back on,” warn three members of
Pitt’s full-time writing faculty. '

Professors Montgomery Culver
and Myron Taube, both short story
artists, and Mark Harris, a
novelist, have never done so, and
are thankful for it.

Culver, currently head of the
writing faculty, has been teaching
21 years at Pitt while at the same.

_time publishing numerous short

stories in such magazines as
Atlantic Monthly, Saturday Even-
ing Post, and Esquire.

“I never took the- risk of being
strictly a short story writer,” he
says. “Sometimes I think I might
have liked to, but teaching has
always offered security.”

Born in Edgewood, a section of
Pittsburgh, ‘Culver attended Pitt
where his father was a mathema-
tics professor. After receiving a
B.A. from ‘Pitt, he continued his
education at the University of
Illinois, eventually earning a PhD.
in literature. '

Culver then moved back to Pitt
as an English professor.

“My first big break came when I
won the Atlantic short story
competition while still a senior at
Pitt. Eventually the story was even
published as a regular article
within the magazine. It was a great
feeling, and from then on, I was a
short story writer.” ‘

Culver now spends about half his
time in his semi-executive role of
department head, and sometimes
wishes he had more time to
teach—and especially write.

“Often I think about giving up
this administrative position,” he
says, “but still maintain my job as
teacher. A short story writer
cannot make a decent living on
short stories alone, unless perhaps
True

he spews out copy for
Confessions.”
Culver notes, however, that

short story writing can be a
lucrative venture for well-known
authors ‘who have established
themselves as novelists.

“There are a handful of famous

writers who can make good money

EEILWIN: BIZARRE. REFINE]!

BY CAROL KUPERSTOCK

Laurie Colwin is interested in
eccentricity, violence, risk-taking,
and romantic love. Since she writes
about only what interests her, her
stories are ﬁlled with whimsically
bizarre characters and situations.

Precocious teenyboppers, dan-
gerous secretaries, elegantly be-
fuddled businessmen‘ and aca-'
demics wander through her stories
like a museum crowd searching for
the correct exit. A refined and
highly-controlled sense of amused

Colwin’s writing. Aidevoted New
Yorker, her stories are set in
sophisticated urban tableaus which
barely mask the chronic hysteria of
city life.

Colwin’s interior settings are

luxuriously detailed descriptions of
chich offices and lavish homes full

of plants, pottery, paintings andv

brassware. Through these elegant
corridors walk some of the oddest
characters in, modern fiction:
Greenie Frenzel, who wears
silvery powder, pearlized makeup,

and vaseline on- her eyebrows;'

Misty Berkowitz, a female Don
Rickles who also speaks German;
Oxford

whose socks are “the deep red of

. arterial blood;” Harry Markham, a

doctoral candidate in art history
who also manages his family's
“Big Plum” supermarket and
nrakes up fantastic stories about
the" checkers. -These" are some of
Colwin’s caricatures.

Laurie Colwin’s writing ex- '
amines, explores, raises hell with,- -

and celebrates that basic theme;
puzzled misﬁts, aloof heroines, and
surly eccentrics are her gallery.
She likes to pair -odd characters

 with odder situations and see



  

what comes out—like mixing all the
paints on a palette to produce a
brand-new color.

In some ways, Colwin resem-
bles one of her heroines. ‘She .has
an unsettling serenity combined
with eccentric habits and a love’ for
making outrageous remarks. She
works as an editor with E.P. Dutton
and has published short sotires,
and “Shine On,’ Bright and
Dangerous Object,” a novel.—Many
of her short stories have been

‘ Steak Subs,

publised in magazines such as The
New Yorker, Redbook, Mademoi-
selle, and Cosmopolitan.

“I'm the only person in New
York who is always home,”
Colwin says. “I refuse to go to the
movies. I won’t go to concerts
because people cough too much
and the acoustics are lousy in New
York.”

Colwin is an obituary freak; she
reads the obits before anything else
when she opens her New York
Times each morning.

.“Obits are little biographies.
You can learn so much. Did you
know the inventor of the pogo stick
diedtoday? On Saturdays, you
notice that mostly old people in
their nineties have died. But on

these 44-year-old psychiatrists who

Monday must be a bad day.”

Colwin, who appeared at Pitt's
first Writers’ Conference-in 1972 as
a book editor, is now returning as a
short story specialist. She will
conduct two workshops, both
entitled “The Short Story As A
JokeX’

“Short story-writing is lining up
information in a certain way.
You’ve got to know what the
information is and what order it
should go in. It’s like a joke.
There’s a premise, a counter—pre-
mise, and a punch line. The reader
reaches the conclusion the author
intended, but he must be put

Beingia writing instructor deﬁ-
nitely makes you a better writer,
says Corinne Bliss and Pamela
 McCorduck, two University of
:: Pittsburgh writing instructors who
will read from their work in a
V,-Faculty Forum Sunday at the
‘Writer's Conference.

 “When you teach writing,”
, says McCorduck, “you really ahve
"ito pay attention to the craft of
writing a lot more. I3 ﬁnd I’ve
‘become more self-conscious about
,my own work since I've started
I te'aching—which is a good thing.
‘— “We have this myth that writing
is something mystical and if you’re
lucky the muse comes and gives it
..T.toi you, and it flows from your body
_ and onto the paper. Of course, this
_ sn’t true, but we like to pretend it

_ McCorduck, who has been teach-
.ing since 1971, was born in the
7’Sa_n Francisco Bay area, attended
the University of California at
Berkley and did graduate work at
,‘Columbia University. Besides hav-
..ing been published in several
1.-periodicals, she has written two
~, '“.‘novels:. Familiar Relations and
t\a_WorIdng to the Ends.’ Presently,
‘she is working on an article about
3-the history of artiﬁcial intelligence.
“I was always very attracted to
3science, but being brought up as a
well-bred young lady, I was told I
couldn't do science for reasons of
my gender. But I joined the
_. science club in high school,
anyway, partly because that was

 _Wedn'esday;;‘

 

 

where the boys were—-the smart
ones anyway. It turned out,
though, that the paramecium were
more interesting than the boys.”

Over the years” she has remained
a fascinated observer of science by
regularly reading scientific jour-
nals; by teaching a course last term
‘entitled “Writing About Science”;
and, finally, by marrying a
scientist.

“That DOES tend to keep me in
touch with science to a certain
extent,” she explains. Perhaps it is
this interest in science that has
given her an almost scientiﬁc view
of writing.

One of the problems she has
teaching, McCorduck says, is
getting young writers to take
themselves seriously, to get over
the notion that writing is something
magical. This, she believes, is a
barrier to their writing. But she
also believes the Writers’ Confer-
ence will help them get over that
barrier.

‘ ‘At the Writers’ Conference, the
students see real, live honest-to-
God writers who publish books.
And they are people who eat,
breath, and sleep. They have
mother-in-law troubles. And they
have gone to college and wondered
if they’d make it—just like
everyone else.”

-Corinne Bliss, who has been
teaching at Pitt for over ﬁve years;
agrees that teaching writing
deﬁnitely changes a writer.

“Yes, I think that being a writing

instructor has changed my writing.
On the bad side, I ﬁnd that
teaching makes you. not want to
write because you’re reading so
many papers that you get exhaust-
ed. On the other hand, teaching
does make you more self-conscious
about your work. It tunes you into

' detail. You realize that every time

you write, you are selecting what
you are going to write, and from all
the possible words in the world,
you’re picking out the ones you
want and how you want to put them
together.’ ’ '

_ Bliss was born in Manhattan.
She graduated from Jackson
College, earned her masters in
english and comparative literature
from Columbia University. She is
presently working on a_ Phd. from
that institution.

V Although she is working on a
novel, her" main effort in the past
has been writing short fiction. She
has been /published in several
literary magazines and was runner-
up last year in the Iowa Short
Fiction Award competition—one of
the most prestigious writing
competitions in the country.

Bliss has-worked professionally‘

in different areas of writing, from
writing true-love stories for teen
magazines to training manuals for
insurance company. (“It was, let
me tell you, pretty deadly stuff.”)

At one point, she worked as an

editor at a now defunct writer
agency in New York where she
marketed other peoples‘ manu-
scripts. People' would send her
manuscripts for books on helicop-
ters. Canadian housewives would
send her cookbook manuscripts.-

writing short stories today,” he
says, “but they probably never
could do it without the fame of their
novels.”

If he had the energy, Culver says"
He
still dabbles from time to time at an
unﬁnished manuscript he started
about nine years ago.

“I can't seem to ﬁnish the novel,
though,”’ he conﬁdes. ‘‘I’m a
different person than I was nine
years ago, and I can’t follow up on
the same ideas I had them”

Although he wonders from time
to time about the changes that

might have occured in his life,‘

Culver. remains content as both
short story writer and teacher. The
one supports the other.

Professor Myron Taube, who has
had almost 50 magazine articles
published, “some famous, some
not so famous,” emphatically
maintains that a person cannot
make a living on writing alone.

“I once knew a friend who was
diligent and talented. He
constantly worked to make a living
strictly on writing,” Taube remem-
bers. “It took him six or seven
years of struggle, but eventually he
was relatively. successful. This
might serve as. an inspiring
example, but in reality, who can

‘wait six or seven years between

meals? I know I can’t.”

‘Taube basically writes for
himself with the hope that others
also will enjoy his work.

“I try to keep in mind that it's I

better to get paid for your work
than not to,” he explains.

Taube says he got into teaching
because he enjoys it and more
importantly, needs a steady in-
come. ‘

“I realized early on that however
good I was as a writer, I was better
as an eater. When I stop enjoying
teaching I will be forced to find
somet_hing else to support my
writing habit.”

Taube was born in New York City
and received his masters degree
and doctorate from New York
University.

Before coming to Pitt, he taught
at'N.Y.U. and also Long Island
University.

The story Taube will read on
Sunday is entitled “In the Cave.”
He says it is a “freak” because it
sprung from his imagination.

‘-‘I very seldom write from my
imagination,” he says. “Basically,
I’m a realistic writer—-I save my
imagination for personal relation-
ships.”

“In the Cave,” Taube says, is
based on “Pl_ato’s symposium,” in
which Socrates relates the story of
how he ascertained the true -
meaning of love from a sorceress. 
Taube will allow us to have a look at
how he imagines the story was
transformed in its telling, from the
sorceress to Socrates to Plato, and
ﬁnally to us.

While earning a living is
definitely important, Taube be-
lieves there is one thing worse than
starvation that could befall a

writer.

“The worst thing that could ‘
happen to a writer,” Taube states V
profoundly, “would be to lose his
creative sense at any age.”

  

While maintaining that writers
should have many alternatives to
their main career, professor Mark
Harris openly discourages students
from the concern of writing for a

living.
“No one can really earn a living
writing well,” Harris says. _

“People who write for a living
usually just bash things out to meet
a deadline.”

Harris, too, believes that it is not
desirable to earn a living strictly as
a writer, but for a rather unique
reason.

“If you outgrow a style of writing
that you’re into, what do you do ‘W
then,” he asks rhetorically. “A lot
of people who merely write for a
living are stuck in their unhappy
careers.”

Harris says he will be a
“reluctant participant” in this
Conference be‘-
cause he believes‘ that much of it
will stress writing for a living.

“Students will ﬁnd out about
ﬁnancial reality soon enough,”
Harris says. ‘‘I would like to see
them retain their idealism ‘so it is

:more deeply ingrained and stays

with them longer.”

He maintains the views he will
give at the Conference will run
counter to the prevailing theme-

Harris wrote for the Port Chester
Daily Item in «New York after '
completing military duty.

He worked for several newspa-
pers and magazines before decid-
ing it was not the way he wantedto
spend his life. ’

Feeling he needed more freedom
in his writing, he went back to
school and later pursued a teaching
career. _ ,

He is the authorof several novels
and autobiographies including Kill-
ing Everybody, Bang the Drum
Slowly and Best Father Ever
Invented. ’

He hasalso authored numerous 
articles, reviews and essays in la, a’

more in the last 10 years than it did
in all the years before. Atﬁrst, and
I think we all were in my
generation, I think I was trained in
the intellectual kind of poetry, for
instance Ezra Pound. Intellectual
poetry served its purpose in this

country by now and now poetry in I

general is becoming more enter-
taining. Of course maybe that

\- eans that the quality of the poetry

'~' 'over all may have declined a bit

because more people are getting

A involved.

“One of the requirements of
poetry should be that it entertains,
Meredith adds, “That’s important
because arts that don’t entertain in
this country fade away into the
background.”

Meredity doesn’t feel like a poet
when he isn’t writing. He shucks
off the vestrnents of the artist and
hits the daily grind again. At one
point he was working in a
warehouse for a year and a half.

“I feel it’s sort of important to

_ stay in touch with the regular sort

- ' life. Those are the people I aim

4'“-"r"riy poems at, and those are the
people I’m hopeful will listen to
me. I watch and listen and try to
get my material from the culture.

“More people are hearing poetry
today because of the poetry
readings. Readings bring poetry
into a town, into the coffeehouse,
into the music hall, and basically it
allows people to enjoy and discover
poetry that perhaps aren’t able to
read it properly themselves.”

“Readings are good, but a poem
that leans on live-stage dramatics
might be a little short on something
hiomewhere. Poems ought to be
able to be read from the printed
page.”

The market for poetry of course

- is limited, but Meredith says the

/

small printing companies, includ- ,

ing the recent trend of co-operative
printing houses are enabling young
-poets to reach audiences that
before weren’t available.

“I don’t especially believe in the '

East-Coast conspiracy theory about
publishers,” Meredith says,
“Things aren’t as provincial as
they used to be, the poetry world
has spread out and diversiﬁed.”
 The ﬁrst “break” for Meredith
came with the publication of a
collection of poems entitled Letter

Yale Press. -
More recently was the publica-
tion of Hazard the Painter by Knopf
Press, a collection of short poems
detailing the life and times of a
gradually successful artist.
Hazard, published last year and
reviewed this summer by the New
York Times, was intended as a
slightly comicaltreatise according
to Meredith although some critics
haven’t caught the punchline yet.
“I suppose they just can't accept
something like comedy coming
from me,” Meredith comments. “I
guess people just don’t laugh easy
these days.” -
In this group of poems threaded
together by the bemused character
of Hazard, can be found one piece
entitled “The Natural History
Museum,” which set in noneother

Meredith’s “Museum,” first_

printed in the Virginia Quarterly
Review is an example of his ability
to use a sparse style and rich
imagery to convey tone and mood
without wasting a single precious
adjective.

If you need a demonstration of

the effectiveness of patience and
concentration, read “The Natural
History Museum” and take
another visit to Carnegie. It’s all
there.

Meredith’s patience for living,
survival and his work manages to

overpower the jukebox racket that

fills these transition times.
Meredith will be bringing that
patience and that style with him
when he comes to Pitt this coming
weekend.

BY CONNIE GIEL

For fun and proﬁt, become a
writer- Well, may be not for proﬁt,
seeing how most writers are

penniless and destitute. And, well, _

maybe not for fun, seeing how most
are suicidal and introspective.

This Year's Writers’ Conference
isn’t out to hype wide-eyed
students, pencils and pads in hand,
about the Great American Novel
and other myths. Conference
Director Lee Gutkind insisted it’s a
feet-wetting affair, a chance to rub
elbows with the ones who have
made it, the ones who can
legitimately talk about the fun and
profit in writing.

Gutkind, an assistant professor
of English at Pitt, said students of
writing can t_ake- just so much
academic, classroom writing.
“Writing is so difﬁcult to learn,
and even harder to teach,” he said.
“It’s such an elusive thing in
school.” ‘

Students very often can get more
from a working writer than from a
faculty member, Gutkind said.':

A working writer himself,
Gutkind’s produced two books, his
ﬁrst, Bike Fever, a travelogue on
life on the back. of a motorcycle.
The second, The Best Seat in
Baseball, But You Have to Stand,

COMPONENT MUSIC SYSTEMS

-— WELCOME TO THE BETTER SOUND OF COMPONENTS -

They are called components because a stereo or quad system is made up of separate pieces of equip-
ment or components. Each component can come from a different manufacturer who specializes in

making that part of the music system.

If you have been remodeling a home, you may have learned that it is impossible to find all the
materials you particularly like from one manufacturer. Since you are choosy, you select doors from
one manufacturer, paneling from another, and furniture from many. In this way you end up with a
better finished product than one manufacturer could give you. '

We of opus one are also very particular about our sound. Our experts test and retest the thousands
of different components on the market to find only the best in every price range. From these we design
complete music systems that sound better, do not become obsolete, and give fewer problems. We be-

full of hysterical ethnicism. Part of
being sophisticated is pulling in
bits and pieces of someone else’s
experience, as Jane Catherine does
with Imelda, her maid. Jane
Catherine is heir to all the
experience, while Imelda is the
experience. That’s why she’s
self-conscious; the only self-con-
scious people are sophisticated
people.” l
Colwin says she has a lot of
“crackpot” literary theory andla
“Thematic mind.” She does not
like to over-emphasize the writer’s
conscious manipulation of symbol-

ism. » 

“A story idea might be set off by
lots of, little incidents strung
together. Symbolism is a fortunate
accident when all the little pieces
come together. Writers go into a
kind of overdrive sometimes.
Symbolism should just support and
drive home the story’s theme. Most
people think it IS the theme, but it
ain’t. If thestory were a building,
the plot would be the girders, the
characterization-. would be the
bricks, and the symbolism'wou1d
be the ornamentation.” ‘

Particularly influenced by the
work of Saki and Evelyn Waugh,
Colsin supports Flannery 0’C0{;'.‘
nor’s contention that a writer must‘-
maintain the “habit of art;” the
constant process ofthinking and
reacting as an artist, allowing all
stimuli and experience open access '
to the mind.

Rereading the preface of Gold’s

.1967 best seller, Fathers, I come

across the passage printed below.
It is about Gold’s father, and the
old man’s desire to still participate
in business and in life. I read it
again and again. It makes me
think- About my own life, about
how far I am going to go, about my
options and my spirit, my need not

and riches both. He went out into
Cleveland in his new Buick in
search of efforts and chances. He
had learned that pain and triumph

them as long as he could still ride.
He watched his friends slow down,
retire or die, and he went to a

says, "seems to ~narrow as his

These are fighting. words,
despicable ideas to an American
writing community that, by and
large, think they have emerged
from the Hemingwayesque tradi-'
tion of involvement, of living what
they write. But Gold doesn’t stop
there. He lashes out again. He

says that the most talented
American writers have isolated
themselves in formal pursuits, in
abstract ideas, while the worst do

ideas for stories and ways of
presenting them. But the greatest
asset, she said, is building up
experience. Like other occupations,
everything seems to fall into place
after getting in there and actually
performing the job.

Though I it involves the basic
.qualiﬁcations of being an editor, a
literary agent's job is an altogether
different ﬁeld. Actually, a literary
agent and an editor will sometimes
meet head to head, with the agent
pushing for the writer of a book or
article and the editor trying to win
his particular requirements from
the piece.

“You have to be tough with the
editor for the sake of the writer,”
said Levine, literary agent for
writers including‘ Peter Shrag,
Richard Goldstein, Raymond Car-'
ver, and Pitt“ assistant English
professor Lee Gutkind.

A literary agent represents an
author and his material. The idea is
to free an author from ﬁnancial and
business worries over a piece which
he hopes will be published.

Some duties include negotiating
sale or leases of certain rights in
the work,’ reserving rights‘, exam-
ining contracts and negotiating
modifications to the authorfs
approval, examining royalty state-
ments and checking on the
publisher’s handling of _a book and
its copyright.

and you must be well-organized,".'-4.:
Levine said. “You must have the 
sense of matching the tastes of the_ “
writer, the editor and the reader.” F 

Also, Levine said, _a literary
agent must be able to read quickly

"and possess an editorial sense in‘  ,
dealing with books and articles and I  I
ﬁnding the right market for them_. - 

“You discover talent and act as a L

in various high school bands with names like Shango, the Prophets, the Outlaws, and then
a group called Horses. It was with the New Delhi River Band that he first played the bass.
”We played mostly at the Barn on Route 17," he says, ”and l remember how Neal Cassady
used to dance to us- Man, he had four shirts and he'd dance till he had no shirts left to
change 'into." Eventually Torbert decided on a life of travel, but it was somewhat curtailed
by his sojourn with the New Riders where he developed his characteristic high-powered but
subtle bass technique. Torbert cites bass influences such as the Dead's Phil Lesh, Ray
Brown, Jack Cassady of Hot Tuna and Paul McCartney. ' -

Bob Weir has logged thousands of hours on tour as a member of the Grateful Dead.
Weir is a sophisticated man who loves to rock and roll. Consequently his vision of King’-
fish is simple. ’’It’s a rock and roll band, a tight spontaneous package, and we're going to let

T 0' - it develope whatever way it may. It's much smaller and more highly mobile that the Dead

is now.”

If joie de vivre is the imprint of Kingfish music, it is also standard of Weir's own life.
Kicked out of seven prep schools, he went down to the Folk Festival at Palo Alto where he

- met Jerry Garcia and they all formed Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Band shortly after New

Year's Eve, 1964. Weir was sixteen. During his seventeenth year the band transmuted into
the Warlocks and when the Warlocks became electric (Phil Lesh joining); the Grateful Dead
was born. ”And that's when I left home," says Weir.

Although he does at times play guitar, Weir prefers defining himself as a structural
guitarist. Weir studiesthe great structuralists — Stravinsky, Debussy, Bach.

Kingfish does not sound like any other band. The first Kingfish album, recorded in
Weir's new home studio at the end of 1975, demonstrates the group's clean, hard lines and
uncanny flexibility, as it moves swiftly and deftly from Mexibilly to direct rock to up-
tempo and jazz—related polyrhythmics. Kingfish is a well seasoned band, a product of the
San Francisco cross fertilization process at its best. This show is for all rockers, young and
old. Get hooked!

E Purins,Slaney Exhibit

BY MREA CSORBA

After the heavy emotionality of
the ﬁfties’ abstract expressionism,
the new, hard-edged geometrical
construction paintings of the~sixties
seemed like high-classed passive

- wall decors, with nothing more to

contribute than the skillful juxta-
positioning of color ﬁelds.

Today, even diehard abstract
expressionists will concede that
“intellectual painting” has come
into its own, demanding as much
viewer involvement as any Jackson
Pollock free-ﬂow painting. And

these ‘cool-headed’, hard-edge’

painters can stray into the sensual
arena, capable of creating the
'soulful—-though maybe inexpress-
ible—emotions that were previous-
ly the exclusive dominion of abstact
expressionism.

Two artists currently being i

,exhibited at the Pittsburgh Plan for
Art, King's Gallery, are prime
examples of this. Girt Purins, who
is a Pitt Studio Arts Professor of
color and design, exhibits extrem-
ely complicated constructions bal-
ancing color and line. In paintings
that take a week of solid work to
execute, he presents us with feasts

-of visual stimuli whose artistic

offering demands possibly the

same length of time , for fully

appreciation. And there’s no
question that the hard-edged
paintings of co-exhibitor Elizabeth
Slaney can match any expression-
istic work with its sensual ﬂow.
,0ne’s eyes get lost in Purins’
complicated, intersecting color
ﬁelds. Not only are the planes
continually overlapping, but his
basic four or five colors shift back
and forth from foreground to
background, depending on which
color space Purins wants accented.
“Spatial Composition No. 6”,
one of his simpler works exempli-
ﬁes this complexity. The main ﬁeld
is a diamond which spreads across
most of his work. The diamond is
intersected at an angle by a large,
but not ' so dominantly-colored
quadrangle. The two ﬁgures’
intersection splits the diamond and
the rest of the canvas’ area into
numerous triangles. The work is
further divided by verticle strips of
color lines.

If all these color ﬁelds don’t
make your head swim, Purins’
smaller palette-knife slashes that
create minute geometries within
the larger ﬁelds will.

Which comes ﬁrst in the process
of painting such complicated
interplays and overlays; color
theme or line dimension? Purins
compares his process, to the
simultaneous creation of melody
and lyrics by Rodgers and
Hammerstein. He will carry the
conception of a new work around in

   Flak EndsFor CooIArt

strips into a sun-streaked forest.
His largest and most demanding
work, “Composition No. Two” lies
before us like a huge, open book,
with his side delineationcs acting as
pages on both front and back. The
center is dominated by complicated
geometric arrangements of plum,
red brown, and cool blues beating
down into the canvas. This action
is subdued in its spread, breaking
into progressively smaller boxes of
triangles which push graduating
strips of color before them. At the

l

.»...a€ . 0.3.- g
his head, waiting for it to jell. 'Once
he starts painting from a sketchy
skeleton plan, color and space

- usually,precipitate each others’

progression.

Purins uses masking tape to
delineate his main color ﬁelds. On
the smaller sections, slashes of
color are freely made with the
palette-knife. The result is
high-energetic,’ lean-cut color
slices, a special characteristic of
this work.

The action of “Spatial Composi-
tion Forest No. Two” simulates a
ﬁlm strip speeding across the
canvas, occasionally illuminated by
bright dabs of color. Number three
of the series alludes to growth and

change. The viewer -seems to_ be
peering through Purin’s vertical!

 

edges of the canvas, the slabs of
color are so narrow that the

impression is of colored rain
streaming down a window pane.

With all the pushing and pulling
of his color spaces, it’s amazing the
work does not tear itself apart.
Attesting to Purin’s unbelievable
ability in balancing the action of
line and color, his works maintain a
solid unity. .

At ﬁrst glance it seems Elizabeth
Slaney constructs her works by
creasing paper like folded fans into
three-dimensional designs.- Her.
work also seems to be illuminated
by the clear, smooth gleam of neon
lighting from behind.

‘Germs’ Play May Be

Catchy Parody of Pitt it

“I don’t remember exactly 

BY BOB MAYO

, Germs is coming to the
University of Pittsburgh and
Robert Becker hopes it’s catching.
4, Germs is a half-hour musical
comedy to be staged by the
University’s Studio Theatre in
April. It is supposedly written
about Pitt, but to hear its author,
Robert Becker, talk,’ one wouldn’t
be quite so sure.

“The thing is that people are
afraid of germs. They don’t realize
that if they’d stop being afraid and
just let them infect their bodies and
be cool about it—not get all hyper
and going to the doctor—germs
would work “for’.’ them. They’d
help out,” Becker said. .

Becker, a 21-year-old Pitt under-
graduate, was sitting at the upright
piano hidden offstage of the empty

- Studio Theatre in the Cathedral of

Learning basement. The studio
was dimly but adequately lit,
though/everything, including the
ﬂoor was painted black.

Becker has the personal pre-
sence of a Woody Allen, and a
comparable physique. His face is
thin and bearded, and his
wire-framed glasses shrink the
appearance of his eyes ever-so-
slightly. Sitting shirtless, bare-
chested and pale in the dark of the
unoccupied theatre, he continued
to talk jokingly about his project.

“This thing about germs is really
not just a play. It’s a whole
revolution, a whole way of thinking
that’s totally different. I really
want to turn people on to that idea,
and that’s one reason why I
decided to do my .play,” he said.

Actually, the play has been a pet
project of Becker’s for the past two

years. Its story is less weighty but ’

just as fascinating as his explana-
tion.

An undergraduate majoring in
-theatre, Becker has written the
music for several student produc-
tions since his freshman year. One
of the more popular was the March
1974 staging of Mad Dog Blues.
Since the close of that play, he has

‘ been seized with the idea of doing
_Germs,

which he

wasn’t fully developed. I had a
song, though, and that’s what led
up to it. Do you want to hear it?” .
With the confidence of a
Broadway pro, Becker turned to the
battered piano and began to play.
“This is the bass,” he said,
picking it out on the keys.
“Drums.” He began mouthing
out the rhythm, making clucking
noises through his teeth- Then he
sang. ,

worms, the creepy crawly creatures
of the night...” He went on for a
moment.
“There are other verses, but
that’s the basic idea,”- he said,

.adding'a chuckle as he made th

music trail off.
“The story starts out about
Clyde, who’s a freshman at Pitt and
who hates germs. He's a
germ-hater‘, his father was a
germ-hater, and his mother was a
famous germ-hater,” said Becker.

“That’s where the song comes in ‘*5.

“He has a roommate naniec:
Itchy Zaliski who he keeps in a jar
because he thinks Itchy Zaliski
looks like a germ.”

Suddently Becker took on the
tone of a grade schooler reading in
class.

“A quote from the play,” he
said,,clearing his throat. “Get
away from me, Itchy Zaliski, you
hairy, scary worm. You can’t fool
me, you pedigree, you look like one
big germ..

“The whole play’s. in rhymed
couplets, you understand.” I

Becker explained how Clyeii
succumbs to Lysol fumes and’”+.:.s
kidnapped by germs that take him
on a “fantastic voyage” through
his roommate’s stomach. Their
plan, said Becker, is to somehow
convert Clyde into being a germ by
convincing him he’s pledging a
germ-hating fraternity.

“Progressive country? Redneck

We’ve been doing this kind of
music for 200 years. If anyone’s
progressive, it’s the audience.”
—anonymous Austin musician

“Nashville cats play clean as
country water. Nashville cats play
wildpas mountain dew.”

-—John Sebastian

It’s a mystery to me that I can’t

' go into a tavern ‘~.~.or club in

l ,Pittsburgh_and hear country music..

   

Yeah, I know on occasion a band
playing the Portfolio will do —a
traditional folk song, but that still
doesn’t satisfy the need. And the
last thing I want to hear is another
version of one of the Eagles’
assembly-line studio songs. I’d
rather have a quart of Iron and sit
around the kitchen table with an
old friend—whenever there’s a lull
in the conversation at least the air

will be ﬁlled with The Outlaws. If ,

you can’t find it on the streets, at
least you can swing at home.
Most of the songs on this album
have been previously released on
the musicians’ other albums, but
it’s still a good anthology for
old-time fans and a fine primer for

peoplejust getting acquainted with ..

this foursome. ,

Ignoring the syrupy style and

While there are many love songs
on the album, they aren’t mushy or
overly sentimental. If you don’t
feel like the everyday housewife,
you’ll like The Outlaws.

Waylon Jennings’ baritone ac-
centuates the quiet, sadly-plodding
“My Heroes Have Always .Been
Cowboys” and the raucous, rag-
time “Honky Tonk Heroes.” The

_latter is two songs in one, opening

softly ‘with funky ﬁddle and guitar,
and adding electric guitars and
drums to boogie the second half.

Perfect,

strong and soulful voice.

Mark James’ “Suspicious

interpreted superbly by Jennings
and Colter. It’s one of the best
pieces of advice on any human
relationship: “Why can’t ya

Willie Nelson’s “Good Hearted
Woman,” a hit for Jennings,
contains an interesting vocal
juxtaposition—Jennings’ deep
solos contrasting Nelson’s twangy-
hillbilly voice.

Three other Nelson songs are
finer than fine. In his early 40s,
Nelson is a native Texan who has
been writing hit songs for other

-. ists, black country singer Char-
‘~~ Xe Pride and Johnny Rodriguez, to

name two. He ﬁnally hit on his own
recently with “Blue Eyes Crying In
the Rain” from Red Headed
Stranger. Last year his annual
Fourth of July music fest-picnic
attracted nearly 100,000 people.

Nelson’s “Heaven Or lHell”
(“Sometimes I take it as far as I
can/ Sometimes I don’t even go/ My
front tracks are headin’ for a cold
water well/ My back tracks are
covered — with snow”) sung by
Jennings, is accentuated with a
muted Coronet and carnival-organ
riffs reminiscent of Garth Hudson’s
“Me and

“Almost busted in Laredo/ But for
reasons_I’d rather not disclose/ But

Nelson, is a touching love song
where he meets by happenstance
an old girl friend in a bar:

about complex ideas and emotions

“Texas” is country boogie as

“Put Another Log,” recorded

_live, is bouncy and sarcastic, as

Silverstein compositions are known
to be. Glaser sings: “Cut me up
some bacon and some beans/And
go out to the car and change the

A BREACH or ACADEMIC FREEDOM. . . .
  THEFACTS ABOUT THE NYDEEN CASE

Dr. Paul Nyden is an Assistant Professor in the Sociology Department, University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Nyden was
awarded his Ph. D. from Columbia University, where his dissertation on the reform movement within the United Mine
Workers Union was recommended with distinction and nominated for the prestigious Brancroft Award. Since coming to
Pitt in 1974, Dr. Nyden has taught nine different courses, far more than any other member of the Sociology Department.
Dr. Nyden's courses have included seminars on Marx, the Sociology of Work and Minorities. All of Dr. Nyden s courses
have been enthusiastically received by students and Dr. Nyden has beenvlauded for his innovative and creative teaching
methods. Both in his courses and within his department, Dr. Nyden has consistently opposed all forms of racism and
male chauvinism and has questioned the growing military influence on campus.

 

Dr. Nyden's interest in the labor movement and progressive struggles extends far beyond the classroom. He is co-
editor of M|NER’s REPORT,‘ a rank and file newsletter which enjoys wide circulation in the coal fields. He has authored
a pamphlet, "Black Coal Miners in the United States" which has been praised by scholars and workers alike. When the
United Mine Workers went on strike in 1974, Dr. Nyden was active in arousing community support on their behalf. The
Allegheny County Labor Council has asked him to teach a course on labor history, and currently he is working on a book

' about the United Steel Workers Union.

As the only labor sociologist in the Department, Dr. Nyden has gained the respect and admiration of fellow schol-
I ars, students and the rank and file worker. WHY THEN ISHE FIGHTING FOR HIS JOB? - E

The following is an accurate chronological history of the events which have transpired in the last few weeks con- ‘
cerning the firing of Dr. Nyden.

1, In February, 1975 a three person Review Committee within the Sociology Department recommended "after » E
full and thorough discussion" that Dr. Nyden was "the type of individual the University may wish to pro-
mote to Associate Professor." / ’ A I . ' -

2. In February, 1976 Dr. Nyden was attacked as a “subversive” by Roger Willoughby-Ray, a right-wing talk
show host on WEEP Radio. Among other things, Mr. Willoughby-Ray demanded that the University fire Dr.
Nyden. The Sociology Department made no official reply to these Mccarthyite attacks. -

3_ On March 9, 1976 the day. of.the Pitt Union elections, Dr. Nyden,’ a member of the PPU was informed by
Sociology Department Chairman, Burkhant Holzner that a new review committee had recommended that Dr.
‘Nyden's contract NOT be renewed. Dr. Holzner read to Dr. Nyden excerpts from the committee's fifteen
page report. He refused to allow Dr. Nyden to view and copy the entire document.

4. A few days later many students, confused and angered by the ‘committee's decision sat-in at Dr. Holzner's
office, demanding a public hearing to examine the reasons for Dr. Nyden's termination and release of the
committee's report. ‘

5. At the insistence of the students a hearing was scheduled for Friday, March 19. Prior to the hearing Dr.
Nyden was personally vilified by several faculty members who would later be deciding his academic fate. One
professor stated that-he would do all that he would to see that Dr. Nyden's contract was not renewed. Pitt
Professor Dr. Paul Lazarsfeld, an eminent sociologist and chairperson of Dr. Nyden's dissertation committee
at Columbia, released an unprecedented and ethically questionable letter in which he endorsed the Commit-
tee's recommendation, claiming that Dr. Nyden's dissertation, which he lavishly praised in 1974, had been ac-
cepted out of charity. ' ’ .

6. . On Thursday, March '18 a press conference was held on Pitt's campus by the Student Committee to Defend
Dr. Nyden. Speaking in the defense of Dr. Nyden's academic and community work were Lou Antal, President
of District 5 of the United Mine Workers; Monseigneur Owen Rice of Holy Rosary Roman Catholic Church
and long time civil rights activist. Other speakers included graduate and undergraduate students and faculty
representatives. _ '

7. The "hearing" began at 10 a.m. in Thaw Hall. The room was filled with undercover policemen. Dr. Holzner ’
announced the "rules" of the hearing and stated emphatically that all discussion would terminate at 11:45.
,  I Though Dr. Holzner claimed to be presiding over the hearing, he continually took direction via head signals '
 from a University attorney, Keith Burr, standing along the side of the room. Mr. Burr never identified him-
 - I self as the University attorney. ,

At the hearing, Dr. Nyden and his counsel again asked for release of the fifteen page report. Holzner again re-
fused. Without yet being informed of the charges against him, Dr. Nyden proceeded to defend himself. Many
students and- revered faculty members spoke in his support. Reknowned Sociologist, Dr. Richard Cloward,
also on Dr. Nyden's dissertation committee, refuted Dr. Lazersfeld’s letter and reemphasized the superior
quality of Dr. Nyden's dissertation. Dr. Cloward also read letters of support from Dr. Herbert Gans and poli-

I tical scientist Frances Fox Pirens. The hearing closed without one shred of evidence being shown in support
of the Review Committee's decision. '

8. That afternoon the senior faculty met under heavy police guard to vote on the committee's recommendation.
After six hours of debate, they voted 14-1-1 to sustain the committee's findings. Among those voting against
Dr. Nyden were members of the Review Committee who, in effect, were voting to uphold their own decision.
Also voting were faculty members who had attacked Dr. Nyden in their classes, some of whom did not even
bother to attend the hearing.

9_ SINCE THE HEARING, DR. NYDEN HAS BEEN “INFORMED THAT THE 15 PAGE REPORT MAY

NEVER BE RELEASED. A STUDENT IN THE SUPPORT COMMITTEE FOR DR. NYDEN WAS ASKED
BY THE E.B.l. TO SERVE AS AN INFORMER ON THE COMMlTTE‘E'S ACTIVITIES. DR. NYDEN AND
AND SEVERAL STUDENT AND FACULTY SUPPORTERS HAVE RECEIVED THREATENING PHONE
CALLS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS, PRESUMABLY WITH THE APPROVAL OF DEAN ROSEN-
BERG AND CHANCELLOR POSVAR HAVE PRIVATELY WARNED STUDENTS THAT ANY FUTURE
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS A SIT-IN WILL RESULT IN CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. SEVERAL LEADING
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS HAVE BEEN INFORMED IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS TO STAY AWAY
FROM DR. NYDEN'S SUPPORT GROUPS.

Until the University Releases the 15 page report and grants Dr. Nyden a fair and equitable hearing in

which he can refute the charges leveled against him, we can only conclude that Dr. Nyden's firing was 

, entirely political in nature and that academic freedom at the University of Pittsburgh has been seriously
jeopardized.

“If Cyndee (Severyn), who is still

Danforth tallied the highest
points. She scored 7.1 points in

“Holly had mono the whole first

Vaulting was the biggest point-

  Cox, Tris Ready '76 Squad

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

 In preparation for the 1976
hséason, Frank Fuhrer, owner of the

Pittsburgh Triangles, broke his
own 11th Commandment, “Thou
shall nothave a_ player-coach,” by
naming Triangle player Mark Cox
as the team’s player-coach. A

4 The announcement comes as a
surprise on two accounts.

First, Fuhrer has always opposed
the idea of a player-coach, prefer-
‘ring instead a non-playing coach-
the situation last year with Vic
Edwards. In 1975, the Triangles
were the only team in the World
V-Team Tennis (WTT) league to have

_,,__,__V__aj.nE)n-playing mentor. Even last
fall, after Edwards’ ﬁring," Fuhrer

again ruled out having a player-
coach.

, Secondly, when Dennis Ralston
was drafted by the Triangles in the
off-season, there was speculation
he would be named coach. After
all, Ralston is a past captain of the
United States Davis Cup team and
last season’s player-coach of the
San Diego Friars.

Upon "Ralston’s drafting, it was
onlly logical to assume Fuhrer
would name him as coach,
especially when one considers the

.st -of the Triangles’ roster had
already been ‘completed.

But unexpected circumstances
changed this scenario. After being
drafted, the Triangles
Ralston had a long-term personal
service contract with" the Los

"Outside of Davis

learned '

"Angeles Strings. If the Triangles
signed Ralston, they had to assume
liability for the clauses in the
20-year contract-, according to
Triangles’ general manager Dan
McGibbeny. .

It should be pointed out the Sa
Diego Friars (Ralston’s ex-team)

and the Los Angeles Strings are_

owned by the same man-—"Jerry
Buss;

Originally, Buss wanted Ralston
toserve as coach for the Strings,
but Ralston refused, McGibbeny
stated». As a result, San Diego
released Ralston in the draft.

“If Ralston’s terms were favor-
.able, we very well could have
signed him as coach, but we didn’t
and we released him because of his
long-term’ contract with Los Ange-

= les,” said McGibbeny.

“In replacing Edwards, Frank
(Fuhrer) and I decidedwe didn’t
want a playing coach. We felt this
would place too much pressure on
the player. .We scoured the’ world
to find a non-playing coach.
Cup and
Women’s Cup, there ,aren’t too
many non-playing coaches. There
is just no market for them.

“We ruled out coaches from
college tennis because NCAA
tennis has not evolved as a major
collegiate sport, plus there is a
chance these coaches might not be
able to command the attention-of
the players as a WTT coach
would.” u "

McGibbeny also pointed out that

Ralston was not the only person in .
consideration for the job.

Tony Trabert, captain of this
year’s U.S. Davis Cup team, was
considered, but was ruled out
because of his commitments to

' television this summer.

Then there was Harry Hopman,
former captain of the Australian
Davis Cup team, who’ dropped

because of a commitment to his

summer tennis camps.

Another ‘candidate McGibbeny
considered was Chuck McKinley,
who played Davis Cup and at
Wimbledon in 1963. Now retired
from tennis, McKinley was close to
signing, but changed his mind
upon promotion in a business
venture.

After these possibilities were
exhausted, Fuhrer turned to Cox,
who accepted.

One of Cox’ concerns will be a
new WTT riiling. Home coaches
now choose the order of events.

The Triangles’ roster is compos-
ed of Cox, Evonne Goolagong
Cawley, Vitas Gerulaitis, Peggy
Michel, Sue Stap (acquired in the
off-season from the Cleveland
Nets) and two WTT newcomers-
South African Bernie Mitton and
JoAnn Russell, last year’s top
collegiate player in the U.S. The
Triangles also have Argentina’s
Guillermo Vilas who may sign in
1977, as a protected non-roster
player.

For the third straight year the
Triangles will. play 44 matches (22
home and 22 away), starting with
the season opener against Ion
Titiac and the Boston Lobsters May
1 at the Civic Arena. Last season’s
opener, also against Boston, turned
into a super tie-breaker affair with
the Triangles winning by one point.

Spring Golf Season:

Many Holes To Be

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

They won’t be playing at plush
courses like Pebble Beach, Palm
Springs or St. Andrews, but the
Pitt golf team will settle for the
friendly confines of the Green Oaks
Country Club in Verona with hopes
of securing another Eastern cham-
pionship for the Panther sports
program.

Coach Steve Petro and his
proteges began practicing last
week in preparation for the spring
season’s opening match March 29
with West Virginia. With 27
candidates “ vying for only six
starting positions, Petro says the

competition is getting hot and
heavy.

“I will pick _12 people for the
team,” he said,‘ “so we have
competition between them. Each
week we'll have people qualifying,
with the guys with the lowest
scores «getting to playing in the
match. .

“We have the nucleus of a pretty
good team because_these kids are
all interested and are working hard
at it.”

With four lettermen returning,
and enough depth to round out the
starting six, the situation looks
bright for the Panthers. «They will
tackle a schedule which includes
ten matches and three tourna-
ments, including the Penn State,
Indiana and Pitt Invitationals.

Three-year letterman Mark Hoff-
man, a senior, and junior Bill
Burkhardt head the list of Panther

 

returnees. Hoffman will have, to

‘overcome a ﬁnger injury if he is to  ‘_
maintain his position as the team's. _. 5  
top performer. Burkhardt, aided 7' 
by the freshman eligibility» rule 

installed by the NCAA three years
ago, will begin his fourth season on

they will select boys according to

Rugby-Charity Prevails  

BY JIM LEWIS

What looks like‘ soccer, resem-
bles football, but is really neither?

The answerlis rugby.

Rugby. One of the most
unknown sports in America, a sport
that holds a special place in the Pitt .
Rugby Club’s heart.

Why does it hold a special spot?
Well, there are~many reasons.

First of all,‘rugby happens to be
one of the most interesting games

   
 

football, contemporary rugby has a
humorous and fascinating origin.

It all began in the mid-1800s in
England. An American soccer
player, in the midst of a soccer
game, became frustrated with the
slowness of the game, picked up
the ball (a no-no in soccer) and ran
down the ﬁeld with it.

The rest of the players became
understandably bothered. So they
chased the American until they
caught up with him and tackled

  

  

Hence, rugby was born. A set ot
rules was devised for the new game
and it became a sensation in ‘
Europe.

The action in rugby is fast" and
furious. Two teams of fifteen
players pass the ball (either by
kicking or by throwing to another
player parallel to or behind him),
and run forward in hopes of scoring -

a “try”—comparable to football's.

. It was one of those plays
consistent with a “run and gun”
basketball team. Keith Starr'drove
V the length of the court, at full

stride, stopped in an instant, and
-_.popped. '

' But it didn’t work quite the way

the play is depicted on the

.. chalkboards during practice. And
the pop wasn’t the sound the ball
falling into the hoop. It was, in
fact, the sound of the intricate
components of a fragile human
joint, a knee, buckling under the
strain of a sudden halt.
. That was the scene, Starr
7 I writhing in pain on the Field House
floor on November 28, in a game
— -against the Yugoslavian National
team. It was the ﬁrst game of the
1973-76 season.

“The doctors,” Starr said,
“couldn’t be completely sure of
_ their prognosis. They thought it
was what is called a rim tear, which
heals up by itself.”

A rim tear usually takes 8 or 10
weeks to heal, and the therapy
I began almost immediately. Starr

began with light jogging exercises,

lifting light weights. In a couple of
weeks, he was back practicing with
‘ the _team, and speculation was
running high that Starr would
return to the Panther line-up, and
help lead an inexperienced squad
through one of the toughest
schedules in the country.
The jump shots, which came off
 _ his ﬁngertips with his characteris-
C? - tic , “line drive” motion, were
I ‘ starting to drop again—in practice.
From time to time the knee was
strong, almost back to normal. But
there were those days

I

 

when I ' you.

walking was an agony and the knee
would swell to double its size.

The deadline for a decision on a
medical red-shirt was drawing
ever closer. That decision had to
be made, and the only way to make
an objective decision was to test the
knee during an actual game.

Notre Dame’s Filghting Irish
were knocking the Panthers
around, using Pitt’s lack of height
to their own advantage, and
holding a 19-point lead when the
Cats‘ called a time-out at the 8:21
mark. When they returned to the
floor, the public address announ-
cer’s note of Starr’s presence in the
line-up was inaudible—everyone
was on their feet, giving Starr‘ a
thunderous ovation.

His.playing time lasted perhaps
two minutes, and for Starr, the
1975-76 campaign ended when he
left the Arena. “I knew almost as
soon as I took the court that the
knee just wasn’t right,” he said.
“I didn’t want to push it; I thought
I might cause permanent da-
mage.” - 4

On Friday, February 13, Starr
entered the hospital for the first
time in his life. “I was scared,
man. ‘I didn’t realize how simple
the whole thing really was.”

After the doctors successfully
removed the damaged cartilage,
the problem, except for the
re-conditioning process, was re-
solved. “I’ve been working out a
lot,” he said. “I can lift about 65
pounds with it right now. .I’ve
done some jogging, and it seems to
be responding well.”

The toughest part of sustaining
an injury like that is the mental and
emotional strain suffered. “It was
a real nightmare, man, let me tell
All I could do was leaf

 

through old scrap books, and watch
ﬁlms of how it used to be. That
helps out a lot and gives you the
desire to work harder.

“I think it’s alright now,” he
said. “The knee will come around
(perhaps in about 10 weeks), but
it’s your mind you have to keep
together." That task, by the way,
has been simpliﬁed by his present
situation.

“As of now, there are some

-teams still pretty interested, like

Phoenix, Philadelphia, Portland
and Cleveland. It’s working out
kind of nice, since the Olympic
basketball tryouts run from May 30

until June 7. (The Pro draft begins
June 8.) It would really be an
honor to make the Olympic team,
but it will -also give me a chance to
show the pro scouts that I can still
do it.”

The pros might shrink their
offers to someone who has just
undergone major knee surgury. In
that case...“I’d like to play for Pitt
again, because they have a’ good
coach, and a good program. I’ve
always wanted to play for a national
championship team, and the way
things look right now, Pitt’s gonna
be ‘bad’ next year! It’s nice to
have such a good program -to return
to.” ‘

It’s been Starr’s dream ever
since he was a kid to play pro ball.
Will he settle a little cheap, just to
break into the pro ranks? “No way,
man. Pitt’s gonna be right back up
there (in the national limelight)

' next year. I know the offers would

come next year if I stay in school.
Besides, money isn't everything.
got pride, too.” . ~

  Americansﬁetting  

Kicks From Rugby

(Continued from Page 21)
offensive player, holding the ball,
runs over the goal line and places
the ball on the ground in the end
zone. The ball must be held ﬁrmly
to the ground by an offensive
player using any part of his body,
thus giving his team four points.

Immediately after scoring a try, a
team attempts a “conversion
kick”—rugby’s extra point. If the
fat, oval-shaped rugby ball splits
the exaggerated goal posts (16-22
feet tall, 10 feet high), the offensive
team gets an additional two points.

Field goals are also common in
rugby. If a penalty or number of
penalities are called, or if a player
running with the ball suddenly
decides an attempt for a try is
impossible, a ﬁeld goal can be
drop-kicked and three points
awarded.

Two 40-minute halves make the
game, during which no substitutes
may enter the game, even for an
obviously injured player, adding
suspense and excitement to the
fast-moving game.

Second, the game of rugby is not
an out-for-blood‘ sport; no one is out
to beat the other team to death. As
a matter of fact, the purpose of
Pitt’s rugby club is not to win, win,
win, but to meet different types of
people. I

“The players share one common
interest—rugby,” said Pitt Rugby
Club president Gene Deporter.
“They share that interest through
socially mixing together.”

There is always a traditional

post-game party’ where players.

from opposing teams—despite
their differences—can be friends
and share common experiences.

To prove that rugby is not a
vengeful, spiteful, out-to-kill sport,
the Pitt Rugby Club will host a
Bermudan team at Munhall April
17 as a benefit for Children’s
Hospital and St.— Peter’s Child
Development Center.

This year, the Pitt Rugby 

will take their love of the sport and
equipment (paid for out of their
own pockets) with them to compete
against such impressive teams as
West Virginia (this Saturday in



Morgantown), Penn State,_George _

Washington, Kent State, the
Toronto Barbarians, the Pittsburgh
Rugby Club, Bucknell, Indiana
University of Pa., California State

. University of Pa., Marietta, and the

Erie Rugby Club. They will
compete in a total of 11 matches
this spring and also attend a
tournament at Penn State. The club

‘hopes to draw many Pitt students

to their home matches at McCayl,1j,Lk
Park in Fox Chapel.  5

COURT RULES
A DISCRIMINATION

3-»

WASHINGTON AP—The 3...”;--
preme Court let stand on technical
grounds Tuesday a federal judge’s
ruling that exclusion of pregnant
women from an employer’s disabi-
lity insurance program was discri- '
minatory.

The court’s 8-0 decision did not,
however, settle the question of
whether such an exclusion is
permissible under the Federal Civil
Rights Act.

That question is still before the
court, in another case on which it
heard arguments in January.
