College students may want to think
twice before shooting herein or taking a
puff of pot because it may soon mean say-
ing bye-bye to their federal ﬁnancial aid

Under next year’s higher education
bill, clnrently in a House-Senate conference
"committee, Congress is looking to suspend
federal ﬁnancial assistance for college stu-
dents convicted of possessing or selling
marijuana or other illegal drugs. 1 .

“Taxpayers have a right to know that
students who have a drug abuse problem
aren’t using tax dollars to go through
schoo ,” said U.S. Rep. Mark Souder,(R-‘
Ind), the prime sponsor of the provision.
“Any time you go into the public treasury,

the public has a right to hold you account- .

Over 40 percent of undergraduates
attending public universities and over half
of private school-goers working toward
their bachelor’s degrees rely on some type
of federal aid to _comple_te their education,
according to a national study done bythe
U.S. Department of Education three years

ago. The study also found. that undergradIl- V

By successfully completing a rehabili-
tation program and testing negative for drug
use twice in random tests, students would
be able to regain aid eligibility more quick-
ly.

Souder said the punishment is meant to
send a warning to America’s young people
that if they experiment with drugs, there
will be calamitous consequences down the
road ‘ _ . .

“It’s stopping (students) ﬁom going
school, which will make matters worse,”
said Tawanda Deshazior, a Pitt senior.
“When they’re not in school, it will give
people more of an excuse to do drugs.”
Deshazior also likened the provision to
a social bias in which students on ﬁnancial

Council approves Piﬂi housing

News Edltor

The door opened Tuesday for Pitt to
construct new apartments for 192 students
in South Oakland when Pittsburgh City
Council unanimously approved the
school’s plan.

The only remaining hurdle is Mayor
Tom Murphy’s approval of the motion, but
Pitt spokesman Ken Service said that
shouldn’t be a problem.

“There’s no expectation that he won’t,”
Service said “That’s standard procedure
and the mayor usually signs what City
Council approves.”

The new housing is the ﬁrst phase in
Pitt’s tlrree-phase Comprehensive Housing
Strategy, which is supposed to add room for
at least 800 students by 2007.

' The three garden-style apartments will
be arranged in a single complex between

Oakland Avenue, Sennott and Bouquet
streets. The University plans to have the
phase-one apartments open’ for students
next fall. .

The stlategycalls for the apartments to
provide 200 beds by 2000, then an addi-
tional 400 by 2007. All these accommoda-
tions will be added to the South Oakland
complex V

Pitt’s second and third phasesare yet to
be proposed to City Council. '

Council President Bob O’Connor said
he is happy with.tl1e prospect of Pitt’s new
housing.

“I think this is the ﬁrst step in really
rejuvenating the Oakland area,” he said.
“It’s good for the students, the community
and the business district.”

City Council voted 9-0 in favor of
Pitt’s proposed housing in its preliminary
vote last week VV1th members Valerie
McDonald and Gene Ricciardi absent from

   
 

'Ihesday’s meeting, council approved the
project 7-O. « -

“I think it shows a renewed partnership
between the city and the University,”
O’Connor said.

The University will have to demolish
sorne.buildings on Oakland Avenue and
clear the land before it can break ground.

 

Pitt’s garden-style
housing.is supposed
to provide 192 beds
next fall. Pittsburgh
City Council voted
7-0 Tuesday to
approve Pitt’s bid.

But Service said he didn’t know when that
would be. .
“We’ll have to get going rather quickly

if we’re going to be inhabited in August,” _

he said. ,
Officially, the University currently has
housing for 5,153 students, which includes

Gay Talese, the writer . widely
acknowledged as the founder of “new
jouma]ism,” couldn’t get into any of the
12 colleges he applied to in 1949. Each
school rejected him because of low
grades. _

“I was proﬁcient "in things there
weren’t any grades for,” Talese said
Monday in an informal question and
answer session prior to his reading, which
kicked off Pitt’s Contemporary Writers
Series.

“There were no grades for being a
good listener. No classes for curiosity
existed,” Talese said.

New journalism, which allowed
Talese to incorporate his curiosity and lis-
tening skills, uses ﬁction techniques such
as description and dialogue in nonﬁction
or journalistic writing. While new joumal—
ism was the term for this style of writing
when it ﬁrst appeared in the ‘60s and ‘70s.,
it is now termed “creative non-ﬁction.”

The University -of Alabama accepted
Talese in 1949 because of a policy “to
diversify an otherwise lily-white campus,”
Talese said, who is Italian.

He has since written ﬁve books and
has been a staff writer for The New York
Tmes and several magazines.

Talese majored in journalism because
he thought it was easy, he said.

“I didn’t want to get pulled out of col-
lege and sent to Korea,” he said, adding

‘ that a student who failed out of college, ~

could easily be drafted.

Talese began his career at The
Cramson-White, the University of
Alabama’s newspaper, writing about ordi-
nary people who wouldn’t normally be
considered newsworthy.

He wanted to write “inside the paper,
not on the front page,” because he found
hard news “impersonal and dictated by
certain rules,” he said.

Journalism is “usually devoted to

public ﬁgures or unusual happenings or
what went wrong yesterday,” Talese said.
He wanted to bring the public “something
you can read next wee ”

At his college newspaper, Talese
wrote about outsiders, covering stories
about people like the 6-foot-11-inch engi-
neering student who refused to play sports.
The other players would look at him and
salivate at the thought of having him on
their team, said Talese. _

After college, Talese found a job as a
copyboy, or intern, in the newsroom of
The New York Times in 1953.

One day on his lunch hour, he
observed a man on a ladder near the Times
building carrying what looked like an
accordion, he said. V

Talese began talking to the man and
discovered that for 25 years he had
changed the Times’ electrical headlines,
which scrolled around the building a block
away. Talese wrote a ﬁve-paragraph story
about how the man was “in touch with the
headlines of the world,” he said.

He said the story went into the limes,
but Talese’s name was not on it.

Talese continues to write about ordi-
nary people today.

His next book will deal with “race,
interracial sex, [and] white trash Ajnerican
males in post-army military years,” among
other topics that have not been decided
since the book is not ﬁnished, he said.

“It deals with losing and failures,”
Talese said.

Talese was the ﬁrst reader in the
Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers Series,
organized by Lynn Emanuel, director of
the English Writing program at Pitt.

“All of the visiting writers are people
who write in more than one genre and in
many cases are pushing the boundaries of
writing,” Emanuel said.

“Gay Talese was one of the ﬁrst peo-
ple to use ﬁction techniques for writing
nonﬁction,” she said. “He, along with oth-
ers, helped create the genre of new jour--
nalism.”

A student leaders run the risk of public failure.

“I applaud your willingness to put your-

The leaders he addressed were gathered

' for the Student Government Board’s ﬁrst

a series of monthly meetings designed to
bring student governance groups together in
an effort to foster better communication.
Approximately 30 students attended the
meeting to ask questions and offer com-

said Murphy, who oversaw the meeting’s
organization. .

Murphy said there is a limited basis for
communication between SGB and its gover-
nance groups. Each SGB member acts as a
liaison to speciﬁc groups, helping to expose
board members to detailed infonnation
about groups that the full board might not
otherwise hear.

\V1th the assembly meeting, Murphy
said, all parties can sit down face-to—face to
share their accomplishments, goals and con-
cerns.

Representatives from the Black Action
Society, Engineering Student Council,
Nursing Student Association and Pitt

Program Council joined Gallagher and SGB
members. .

Gallagher discussed the role of the
Student Affairs Office as a student advocate
and mediator in crisis management, program
development and resource management

“We’re doing a lot of good things but
we really don’t know yet if we’re having an
impact,” he said.

James Powell, of the ESC, told SGB
about his group’s professional development
week during which st11dents receive infor-
mation about getting into graduate school,
learn about public speaking and practice
interviewing techniques.

SGB President Alyson Wallach present-
ed issues the board has been involved with

this year, such as representing the student
body at city hearings about Pitt’s housing
expansion and working to implement a pro-
gram that would allow students to ride Port
Authority vehicles with their H) cards.

Wallach also discussed current SGB
projects, including the Pittsburgh Project, in
which students perform community services
such as cleaning litter otf local streets.

“It’s a great way for students to help the

‘community that constantly helps us,” she

said.

Previous SGB bodies have held student
assembly meetings, but there hasn’t been
one for several years, Wallach said Diﬂerent

notion that if you need the ﬁnancial aid, then
the drug standard applies to you and if you
don’t need ﬁnancial aid, then it doesn’t
apply,” said Jacqueline King, director of fed-
eral policy analysis for the American
Council on Education, a group that repre-
sents hundreds of colleges and universities
throughout the nation.

She said not only does the provision
suggest prejudice — if a student: is poor
enough to need ﬁnancial aid then he is more
prone to experiment with drugs — it also
has the all the right ingredients for creating
an administrative nightmare.

“College campuses are not going to
know who has‘ been convicted of drugs and
who hasn’t unless the student voluntarily
gives them this infonnation,” King said.
“Are universities supposed to do some huge
background check? It’s just very confusing
and this provision doesn’t make it clear how
institutions are supposed to ﬁgure this out.”

While Souder sees problems and con-
cedes the provision may take awhile to be
implemented, he disagrees with critics who
suggest thereare no solutions. 1

“My feeling is that these are universities
and this is the United States and people are
tracking every type of information under the
sun here,” Souder said

He also said concern over the provision
showing bias in favor of students able to

FROM PAGE 1

9 aiford college without the help of the gov-

ernment is misplaced
This system will help students on ﬁnan-
cial aid to confront their drug problem and

get the help they need to put their life in
order, Souder said, whereas students with
more money may never confront it.

“It’s not punishment for one group, but
tragedy for another,” he said

Both the House and the Senate have
overwhelmingly approved the higher educa-
tion bill, which includes the drug provisions,
and Souder is on the conference committee
that will produce the ﬁnal draft for President

' Clinton.

The U.S. Department of Education
opposes the provision on the grounds that it
would “largely duplicate existing law deny-
ing federal beneﬁts to individuals convicted
of a drug offense under federal or state law.”

“'Ihere’s already provisions in place,”
said Julie Green, U.S. Department of
Education spokeswoman. “We feel this is
redundant.” ,

At one time, Clinton threatened to veto
the bill because of this issue and others, but
has since agreed to sign it, said King.

Suzanne McCol1och, of Pitt’s Oﬂice of
Admissions and Financial Aid, agreed with
Green, saying doesn’t see why an additional
law is needed when “judges now have the
authority to suspend students’  aid
in their rulings.”

Because she can’t remember a time
when a Pit student was denied federal aid
because of a drug conviction, she also does-
n’t see how necessary the provision is.

Between 1995 and 1997, 161 Pitt stu-
dents were arrested for drug abuse viola-
tions, according to Pitt campus police crime
statistics. .

years, one long-term study conducted by the
University of Micl1igan’s Institute for Social
Research found In 1996, just over 49 per-
cent of students admitted to using drugs,
down ﬁom 52 percent in 1991. The survey
began tracldng students in 1975.

This ﬁgure I'l1I1S contrary to what
Souder believes is the continuing explosion
of drug use among young adults.

“When you look at the issue holisitical-
ly, one of the problems is on college cam-
puses and that is one problem this (bill) is
looking to-curb,” he said

While universities would be responsi-
ble for enforcement, the Department of
Education would be the agency in charge of
deciding how that is to be achieved, Souder
said

“I’llbethe ﬁrstto saythatthere needs to
be a lot more work done,” he said “This
doesn’t mean that once it passes, it will go
into alfect Nov. I.’’

Questions relating to drug offenses over
the summer and offenses by international

students must be answered before things can .

progress, he said

Others would rather see these problems
wither away along with the rest of the provi-
sron.

“We don’t think ﬁnancial aid should be
tied to drug charges, especially when it deals
with furthering someone’s education,” said
Jamie Pueschel, legislative director for the
United States Student Association, a lobby-
ing group that represents college students

across the nation “To base ﬁnancial aid"

upon drug charges is both punitive and
counterintuitive to the goal of helping stu-
dents.”

Federal funding should not
go to students who use drugs

A provision of the higher edu-
cation bill is currently under dis-

cussion in a House—Senate confer- S

ence comnrittee. If passed by
Congress, federal ﬁnancial assis-
tance for college students convict-
ed of possessing or selling illegal
narcotics will be suspended.

More than 40 percent of pub-
lic school undergraduates and 50
percent of private school under-
graduates are currently receiving
federal ﬁnancial aid of some kind.
Keeping in mind the vast numbers
of students who apply for federal
aid such as Stafford loans, Pell
grants and work study, this is a
good strategy for “weeding” out
some of the applicants.

Under the bill, a student who
is charged once for drug posses-
sion is suspended from federal
financial assistance for one year.
For the second offense, the sus-
pension lasts two years, and the

"third offense suspends the student

indeﬁnitely. Though this’, on top of
a possible ﬁne and jail time, is a
bit extreme, those who choose
narcotics over education do not
deserve to receive federal funding.

The funding should go to stu-
dents who are committed to their
academic pursuits. Narcotics
severely undermines academic

endeavors. If students are not
going to be responsible for their
lifestyles, the federal government
should not be responsible for
funding their education. Also, if a"
person can afford cocaine, why
should he have ﬁnancial aid? If
students have money for drugs,
they should at least have some
money for college. I

With sg many students vying
for federal aid, funds should be
given to students with the highest
propensity for learning — not
those who get high.

There are,’ however, several
shortcomings to this proposal:

0 What if, in the heat of a party,

a student tries a joint for the ﬁrst
time and is busted by the cops?
' - What if an athlete on med-
ication is wrongly identiﬁed by
urine sample as taking illegal nar-
cotics? ‘ .

- The proposal would still not
act as a viable deterrent. As proven
by “the war on drugs,” -tougher
measures do not mean lower num-
bers of drug addicts.

Thoughthe bill does not take
into account several pertinent
issues, for the sake of education
and the need to distribute federal
funds efﬁciently, the proposal is a
good idea.

  Rally against organized sport!

As many people obviously lmow, this past
weekend was the Pitt—Penn State football
game. The stadium was ﬁlled to capacity, Pitt-
wear was ﬂying oﬁ the shelves, and school

-spirit was positively frothing. Pep, vim, vigor

and a determination to smear Penn State across
the stadium were shining in every face.

It’s all crap.

Granted, sports are exercise, and exercise

is a good thing. It’s necessary to stay healthy
and have the energy to do what you really want
to do. It’s a good thing that our culture encour-
ages it, but enough is enough. When a form of
exercise is glorified in the manner of the Pitt-
Penn State football game, or in any of the pro-
fessional sports, where millions of dollars and
countless hours are spent on it, it verges on
ridiculous. -
_ I recognize the fact that many
people. regard sports as entertain-
ment. Sitting for hours watching
other people nm around has always
struck me as a bit vapid. But that’s
ﬁne; if you want to watch, then watch. If you
want to root-for a particular side, then root for
it. But for God’s sake, don’t take it to extremes.
Having pride in our accomplishments is one
thing. Wanting to ﬂaunt them in the faces of the
opponents and anyone else standing nearby is
another. It’s time to put an end to this sad
excuse for a rivalry and start spending our time
on things that are worthwhile.

I was afraid to leave my room on Saturday.
I could see swarms of sports-crazed people on
the streets below, and I could see the incredible

-traﬂic jams on Fifth Avenue from the other

window. To add to it all, it was if g hot on
Saturday. I was sure that if I left my nice, safe

building, I’d have to plow through teeming
masses of jocks and jock—fans in sweltering
weather, and that was just not what I wanted to
do. I know that big rivalries like these are good
for the school’s economy, but when students
who aren’t sports fans are afraid to set foot out-
side in broad daylight, there’s a problem. '

“School spirit,” the neatly "sanitized term '

for a widely encouraged and often vicious bias
in young people toward a particular institution,
usually evolves into patriotism and/or national-
ism. What’s wrong with patriotism? you ask.
To begin with, it’s an ignorant way to look at
the world. This kind of ﬁerce loyalty to an

institution/country is dangerous because it _

blinds you to the proverbial “big picture.” I
hate to be trite, but it can get really ugly really
' quickly. Sadly, our culture encour-
ages this distorted, warped loyalty
and even gives it a noble—sounding
“ism” name.

All this is not to say that you
cannot favor one country over
another or one school over another. If a partic-

ular country or school makes a deep impres- _

sion on you, you’re bound to feel warm toward
it — that’s perfectly acceptable. What’s not
acceptable is taking your affection to extremes

and assuming that no other country/school

could possibly be better. If you don’t approach
life with an open mind, you may as well not be

V living because you’re not getting the full'expe-

rience. And if _you don’t have an open mind,
you blind yourselfto the faults or drawbacks of
the institution to which you’ve tied yourself,
and that is just sad It’s a stupid way to live.

Prior to reading the main smutty part of

’Kenneth Starr’s report (admit it — you

skipped directly to it and read that part only,
too), I’d never thought of Bill Clinton as
much of a cigar man. He’d always seemed
decidedly anti—tobacco to me. But now I’ve
reconsidered. Maybe he was just against the
smoking of tobacco products. I don’t recall

hearing him voice any opposition to the use ,
. of tobacco products, cigars in particular, as
‘ sex toys.

As far as this whole Clinton mess goes,
I don’t really know what to think No, I
would not buy a used car ﬁorn the president,
and I wouldn’t want him hanging out with
my college-aged daughter if I had one
(which is an impossibility, really, seeing how
I, myself, am college-aged).

drag me straight to the romance-novel sec-
tion of the nearest bookstore. KerrStarr is the
classic example of the brother who sneaks

around and strips down to his briefs and
reads the smutty parts of her romance nov-
els. He obviously took great pleasure in
extracting every last drop of smut ﬁom
Monica Lewinsky’s story.

Ofcourse, I took great pleasure in read-
ing the smut that Ken Starr discovered, so
I’m not sure where exactly that puts me. At
least I don’t own a copy of Naughty
Neighbors magazine.

But I don’t quite understand why every-
one is so surprised about Bill Clinton’s ten-
dency to lie. The majority of the American
people who elected Clinton to the presiden-
cy in 1992 did so knowing that he lied when
he a) said didn’t inhale and b) said he hadn’t
had an extramarital affair with Gennifer
Flowers. .

I was only 14 in 1992, but if I could
have voted, I would have voted for Bill
Clinton, too. Look at the other options: Ross
Perot (to use a “Friends”-isrn, I won’t go
there) and George “No New Taxes” Bush
(though I guess the whole “no new taxes”
thing seems rather tame when compared to
our cunent controversy).

I had the opportunity to hear George

Bush speak in 1990 when I was at space
camp (no, it wasn’t like the movie — there
was no robot, and I didn’t accidentally get
launched into space). I saw him before he
madehisgrandentrance.HeandIhadan
intimate moment, one might say. He didn’t
make a pass at me, though. He gave me one
of those cheesy thurnbs-up signs. But
George Bush does seem more of a child-
molester type than a have—sex-with-intem
type. But to use that “Friends”-ism once
again, I won’t go there.

More than anything else, what I think

- wea1lhavetoleamﬁomthisClintonmessis

that we live in a sex-obsessed society. Some
people are obsessed with sex and have a lot
of it (Bill Clinton, Marv Albert, porn stars).
Other people are sex-obsessed and have an
average. amount of sex (your next door
neighbor, your parents), and still other peo-

ple are sex-obsessed and never have sex.

(college students, other young people who
choose to wait until they’re married for per-
sonal reasons or because God said so,
Catholic ministers who choose to wait for-
ever because God said so old men who
choose not to take Viagra and their wives or

lovers, etc.).

There are also people’ who spend most
of their time ranting and raving about how
sex,despitethefactthatitisanat1nalfImc-
tion, is inherently evil But tl1ey’re sex-
obsessed, too, in a sense. The point is, there
isn’t really a person in this country who "isn’t,
deep down in his or her heart, really sex-
obsessed. '

Well, there is one exception, maybe. I
was watching one of those talk shows a cou-
ple of weeks ago, and an individual named
Toby was introduced. Toby was 100-percent
neuter; it had neither testicles nor ovaries.
The people in the crowd chose to ask Toby
the obligatory questions about its anatomy (it
had a urethra, nothing e1se)'and about its
wardrobe (it dressed in a neutral way —
stuck to unisex tunics and turtlenecks).

No one asked Toby what it thought
about the Clinton mess. I guess everyone just
assumed he’d have a neutral opinion.

Stephen May thinks‘ Toby should be appoint-
ed dictator of the United States come the
year 2000, or whenever Bill Clinton gets

As I walk through my
adopted home of Pittsburgh,
speciﬁcally Oakland, I ﬁnd
myself coming across melan-
choly  and again. I
can’t help but wonder why.

My ﬁrst thought is that
maybe your signiﬁcant other has
been cheating on you. Well,
sorry, move on with your life.
This same bit of divine advice

‘ goes with almost any situation.

Take your time to grieve, be
angry, ﬁnd solutions, and take a
nice warm cup of “Deal VV1th

’ It.” What can I say? Life’s tough

You probably have two
things going for you. First,
you’re probably young. Being
young at heart is great, but it’s
easier when you’re yormg in
body as well Second, you’re in
college. This is supposed to be
the best time of your life. These
two things also have something
else in common: they’re ﬂeet-
ing. You won’t always be yolmg,
and sooner or later you will
either graduate or drop out of
college. You might. as well enjoy

depressed all the time.

You are probably thinking
to yourself, “What the hell does

this guy know about my prob-
lems?” Well, I know because
I’ve been there. I’ve had rela-
tionships fall out ﬁorn beneath
my feet. I’ve had ﬁiends and
family taken before their times.
I’ve had dreams stolen from me
in situations beyond my control.
But I am still here. I’ve rolled
with the punches and come
through stronger because of it
Forlknowthatiflstilldraw
breath, I can make a difference
andcanmakethelivesofother
people and my own life better.
Then I thought, Maybe it’s
not the personal problems that
are depressing these troubled
souls, but perhaps it’s just that
they don’t have anything to do.
In response to that, I can only
say that Pittsburgh is what you
can make of it. Sme, it’s not the
city that never sleeps; there is
only one New York, and this
isn’t it. When I decided to come
to Pittsburgh two years ago, L
like many New Yorkers, thought
that this town was a cesspool of
old, decrepit buildings and steel
mills that pollute excessively. I
was pleasantly surprised when I
realized how wrong I was.
There is so much to do in
this town, and there is such a
variety of entertainment. For
example, if you like sports,
Pittsburgh has three professional

teams. Also, the Strip District
has food and stores representing
many dilferent cultures. There is
a theatre presence that one
would not think of ﬁnding in
Pittsburgh. If‘ dancing is your
thing, Pittsburgh is swingin’, and
Imeanthatliterally.Youcanﬁnd

_placestoleamandparticipatein

swing dancing if you are willing
to look for them. If you want to
enjoy the outdoors and nature,
there are several parks in the sur-
rounding area — not to mention
Phipps Conservatory, which is
beautiful at this time of year.

If perhaps you seek a nice
respite from McDonald’s and
cafeteria food, then I suggest an
a trip to Shadyside, which is also
good for a nice time with a loved
one. All I am saying is seek and
ye shall ﬁnd. With not having to
pay Port Authority bus fares,
seeldng has become a lot easier.

You may say, “I don’t have
money.” Well, then get a job. I
have a little secret that I don’t
drink many people know about
Everyone’s hiring  almost. If
you walk down the street long
enough, you will see a “Help
Wan ” sign. True, it probably
won’t be your dream job or a job

that pays a large amount of

money. But guess what —— it
pays, and if you want to do any-

thing and don’t want to go cry-‘

ing to mommy and daddy and
asking for money, then I advise
you to get one. You can turn to
thebackofthepapertoﬁnda
job or even enroll in a decent-

paying research experiment. My .

point is, if you need money, the
opporumity is there.

So now I ask, What is there
to be so miserable about? VV1th
youth, knowledge and opportu-
nity knocking down your door,
what could possibly stop you

from enjoying yourself? The

answer is simple: you. You are
the only reason you’re not
happy. Be it se1f—pity or a lack of
motivation or imagination, you
are holding yourself back So
this weekend, when you’re done

rooting for our Panthers, take _

time to discover Pittsburgh.

One more thing: Smile. By
the simple action of smiling,
you’re subconsciously telling
yourself that 9 you are happy.
Then, when you are smiling,
look back at someone else, and I
bet when that person sees you

game could
mean a lot

In many ways, last Saturday’s
game against Penn State was Pitt’s
biggest game of the year. It drew the
biggest crowd, generated the most
excitement, and juiced the emotions of
fans more than any other game this
season will. _

But in other ways, this Saturday’s
game at Virginia Tech is just as impor-
tant to the Panthers’ 1998 season.

A win over the Nittany Lions
would have boosted the Panthers’ con-
fidence so much that it would have
turned the year around and jolted them
into the top 25. The -success would
have carried through to the rest of their
games, and a nice postseason bowl trip
would have capped off the year.

All that is still very possible, but
don’t forget, Penn State was a noncon-
ference game. Virginia Tech is a Big
East opponent, and the team’s Big
East record is what really matters.

The Hokies are a fairly talented
team. At 3-0, they’re currently ranked

‘ 21st in the country. But they are a team

Pitt could be competing with at the
end of the season for second, third or

A fourth place in the Big East.

A team needs six wins to qualify
for a postseason bowl berth, but six
wins does not guarantee a New Year’s
trip. v
Because of new agreements
between the Big East and the various
bowls, it appears that third place in the
conference is what it will take to guar-
antee such a trip: (Last year, Pitt’s
fourth-place ﬁnish sent the Panthers to
the Liberty Bowl); _

Butif the team ﬁnishes fourth or
fifth with six wins, it is still likely that
it will be invited to one of the at-large
bowl slots not associated with the Big
East. -

I admit, it is way too early to start
talking aboutthe postseason, but it is
not too early to start talking about the
importance of conference games.

After the way the team played on
Saturday, it appears that Pitt could
have an even better team than last
year.
But the thing that could determine
how the Panthers play the rest of the
season is how they respond to last
week’s loss to Penn State. .

The players could either use
Saturday’s near-win as motivation and
realize that if they can play that well

Women's hockey coming to Piﬂ

Marianne E. Graham

For The Pitt News

If someone mentions “Pitt hock-
ey,” what comes to mind? For many
students, probably nothing. Like
many club sports on campus, Pitt
hockey does not get the recognition
it deserves.

This year, however, the hockey
program is taking a monumental

' step toward gaining recognition by

adding a women’s team.

By adding a women’s squad to
its long-standing men’s squad, the
team made a gesture that essentially
said, “yes, we are ready to be varsi-
ty.”

During the first meeting of the
season, men’s head coach Wade
Chouinard invited the women of the
University to come out for the new
team.

“I wanted to give the women the
same opportunities that the men
have,” said Chouinard. “Women
should be able to have the chance to

extend their playing years into col-

lege. ‘And newer players should
have a chance to learn, a sport they
love.” C

The men promised to assist the
women’s team by helping the
women learn the game, allowing the
them to practice with the men’s
team’s goaltenders, and, for now,
having Chouinard_ coach both
teams. ' V

The men’s team has already sac-
rificed some of its icetime so the
women could practice, including
half of its ice time on the third day
of tryouts.

The men’s team also helped by
giving the women one—on-one
instruction.

The attitude of the men’s team
and the general feeling around cam-
pus is one of excitement and sup-
port, similar to what other women’s
teams in the area have experienced.

According to Noreen O’Malley,
athletics director of Chatham
College, the Chatham women’s

team expected to hear a few jeers
while playing during intermission at
a Pittsburgh Penguins game earlier
this year. But the Civic Arena crowd
was surprisingly supportive. D

“We thought we’d hear com-
ments like ‘get these girls off the
ice and send them back to the
kitchen,’ but it wasn’t like that at
all,” O’Malley said. “Many fans
stayed in their seats during the
intermission to watch the game.
They seemed really interested.”

“The fans came to see a hockey
game, and hockey is what we gave
them,” she added.

Chatham, a women’s college,
started its women’s ice hockey pro-
grama few years ago. After a lot of
success, Chatham decided to make
its club team into a varsity team last
year. Now the squad is the only var-
sity-level women’s hockey team in
the Pittsburgh area.

Pitt’s new team will be the first

Senior captain Drew Kopp leads men's soccer squad

Nick Somogyl

For The Pltt News

“A battle-tested, total player,” is
how his coach describes him.

“A leader by experience,” says his
teammate Phil Matilla.

Who is this masked man? you may
ask. Why, it’s -Pitt’s very own Drew
KoPPs a senior captain and four-year
starter on the men’s soccer team.

Kopp began his career at the age
of 6, with weekends ﬁlled with tour-
naments and supportive parents will-
ing to be his wheels. He comes from
an athletic family; his sister plays soc-
cer for Bloomsburg University, and
the rest of his siblings are also ath-
letes. V
A standout player from Cedar
Crest High School _in Lebanon, Pa.,
Kopp was recruited as a forward and
was expected to be a big goal-scorer.
Since then, his position and worth to
his team have expanded. He is now a
center midﬁelder, a strong defensive
position. '

However, according to head coach
Joe Luxbacher, “He plays better when
he’s not expected to score goals.”

This has not deterred Kopp, who
has netted four goals already this sea-
son. ' -

When asked about his feelings on
last season, Kopp expressed a lot of
disappointment. '

“We were ranked for three weeks,
and [we] were one win away from
making the Big East tournament,” he
explained. . ‘ T '

This disappointment fueled a com-
mitment to training in Kopp. He real-
ized that he could win against better

competition in the Big East by being

in shape.

“I’ve played against some talented
guys, but [I’ve] succeeded against
them because of my endurance,” Kopp
said. _

Kopp also spoke'of the lofty goals
he and his teammates, have for this
season. i a
“Our first goal this season is to
place high in the Big East,” said Kopp.
“Then to be at least second in the
region, hoping to make the NCAA
tournament, with a good showing
there.” ' ' .

As for the personal goals of this
marketing major, he is unsure. “A job
after school would be good, but hope-
fully there’s more playing in my
future,” Kopp said. “I’d like to give
professional soccer a whir .”

Drew has been heated in intense

competition throughout his life and
tempered by the cold, hard battle" of
the Big East. He has remained virtual-
ly” unscathed, with only minor ankle
trouble, and has blossomed into a
strong player. He has withstood posi-
tion change and adversity at Pitt, and
he will probably continue to shine on
and off the ﬁeld. .

“Drew plays hard. And he trains
hard. He’s not a rah-rah-rah kind of
guy. He" leads by‘ example,” Luxbacher
said.

And what a good example he is.

FROM PAGE 7

Athletic Conference now supports
two leagues for women.

One is the Women’s Hockey
League, a Division I league com-
prised strictly of varsity level
teams. The other is the Women’s
Hockey Alliance, a Division III
league consisting of both varsity
and club teams.

Many colleges and universities
are considering adding women’s
hockey to existing sports programs
in_ order to satisfy the Title IX gen-
der-equity requirements. Pitt’s
men’s team hopes that by solidify-
ing both the men’s and women’s
hockey programs, the University
may accept both as varsity sports.

The Pitt men’s hockey team’s
first game takes place Oct. 3. For
more information on volunteering
or participating in either the men’s
or women’s teams, please contact
coach Wade Chouinard at hock-
eyc+@pitt.edu., or visit the Pitt
hockey website at

http://www.pitt.edu/~hockeyc.
