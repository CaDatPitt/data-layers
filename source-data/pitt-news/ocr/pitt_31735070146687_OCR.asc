Four Pitt Pathfinders held
3—foot—tall signs well overvtheir
heads, so that anyone looking over
the ﬂat black caps in the crowd
could see them.

Amilling mass of people packed
the lower lobby of the Petersen
Events Center around 1 p.m. Sun-

day, an hour before graduation cer-

emonies began. The lower lobby
would empty in less than an hour,
and remain largely quiet until the
new Pitt alumni left with family
and friends around 5 p.m. E
The signs held by the Pathﬁnd-
ers, studentemployees who lead

tours for prospective students, di-

rected the family and guests to the
concourse level and the graduates
to the lawn level. _

The graduates, in uniform with
their black caps and gowns, ﬁltered
out of the crowd. Beneath the
gowns they wore a variety of cloth-
ing, ranging from sweatshirts and
jeans to full suits and dresses.

Most of_the students. packed
the lawn level of the Pete,=lining
the railings while they waited for
the ceremony to begin. A buzz of
conversation ﬁlled the space, while
graduating students separated
themselves by school. .

The‘ School of Arts and Sci-
ences, ‘by far with the largest with
more than twice as many graduates

as any other school, planned to
walk across the ﬂoor of the Peters-
en Events Center ﬁrst, and all the
other schools would follow. More
than 3,000 students were slated to
graduate that Sunday afternoon.
Students continuedgto arrive,
some jogging as they entered the
doors, arriving 15 minutes before
the ceremony started. ‘
Patrick Mansﬁeld, who gradu-
ated with a degree in art ‘history,
said the ceremony and prepara-

tions were “a little hectic.” He had '

arrived at least a half hour ‘early,
when most of the students had
gone up to the lawn level of the
Pete.

From the packed lawn level,
the black-clad students were led

through the interior of the Pete
before coming out on the ﬂoor,
where several thousand seats and
a raised platform had replaced the
basketball court.

Sometimes the caps and gowns
were the only things alike for any

two students. They wore every, ,

kind of footwear from sneakers to

> boots and high heels to ﬂip-ﬂops.

One or two women went barefoot,

. carrying their high heels in their

hands. —
As Chancellor Mark Norden—
berg started the ceremony around

’ 2 p.m., the students settled them-

selves in their seats, and the noise

of ‘the crowd died down. A C

Mayo in

On May 5, 1862, a group of out-
gunned and outnumbered Mexican
solders won an unlikely victory
over French invaders at the Battle
of Puebla in northeastern Mexico.
Their victory did little to turn the
tide of the French invasion, but it
marked the start of a favorite party
holiday in the United States.

Today, many in Mexico, and
even more in the United States,
will celebrate Cinco de Mayo as a
symbol of Mexican resilience and
independence — using the holiday
as an opportunity to share His-
panic history with people of other
cultures.

“Cinco de Mayo is an oppor-
tunity for Mexican—Americans to
take pride in their culture, to take
the time to educate others about
our heritage,” said Luis Rico—Guti-
errez, a former Pittsburgh resident
who was active in the local Mexi-
can community for more than a
decade. "

“It is a particularly important
day this year during the approach
to the bicentennial of Mexican in-
dependence,” Rico—Gutierrez said.
‘There is pride both in the United
States and Mexico about being in-
dependent and autonomous. That

is what this holiday is all about, V

and that is ‘something Mexicans
and those from other cultures can
share.” A

‘ Rico—Gutierrez lived in Pitts-

V burgh for 14 years and was very
A active in the local Mexican commu-

nity before joining the Iowa State
University faculty and becoming
one of -the school’s deans in July
2009.He recalled a few of his ex-

Committee narrows

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

One of eight names — from a‘
list that started with more than
100 — will soon have the title
“Provost” in front of it.

The Provost Search Commit-
tee, a mix of 20 students, faculty
and staff members at Pitt, began
in—person interviews for the next
provost this week. The candidates
all came from the Association of
American Universities or schools
similar to Pitt, committee chair
Randyjuhl said.

Dennis Curran:

“I'm not looking for the
best provost for the chem-
istry department. I think
that is too small a goal. I'm
looking for the best provost
for the University"

By mid-May, the committee will
give Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
a list of four or ﬁve unranked can-
didates to replace outgoing Provost
James Maher. Maher announced
in November that he would retire
as provost and return to teaching

in the physics department of the
School of Arts and Sciences.

Juhl said he hopes the Univer-
sity will have its new provost, one

of the «liighest ranking adminis-

trators in the University, before
July 1, thebeginning of the new
ﬁscal year.

A few members of the Provost
Search Committee explained what
they hoped to ﬁnd in a provost.

Student Government Board
president Charlie Shull said he
is one of the few members of the
committee who directly represents
undergraduate student concerns.
The other is Rosemary Natale,
president of the College of General
Studies student government.

Shull said many of the candi-
dates and most of the committee
focused primarily on academics
while conducting the search, and
the undergraduate representatives
needed to look at qualities outside
of academia, such as how a provost
would work with Student.Aifairs.

“It is going to be very difficult to
gauge, but a mega part of what I am
trying to ﬁnd‘ out,” Shull said.

The University’s next provost
will have to look at a program and
say, “Let’s not be afraid to change

it,” Shull said. He’s not looking for

large changes, but Shull thought
the ability to look at a program
and change it if necessary will be
important.

Looking for a single issue to use
to select the provost is not the best
way to do it, said Dennis Curran, a
committee member and a chemis-
try professor. ’

“Pm not looking for the best

ment. I think that is too small a
goal. I’m looking for the best pro-
vost for the University,” Curran
said. i ”

Danieljimenez, last year’s pres-
ident of the Graduate and Profes-
sional Student’s Assembly, said

he oped the next provost would

A have the ability to spot promising

{research programs and support
them, like Maher.

For examples,Jimenez pointed '

out Pitt’s research in bioengineer-
ing and nanoscience.
The concerns of GPSA for the
new provost, Jimenez said, are
“more academically focused.”

In representing undergradu-
ate students, Shull said he wants
to ﬁnd a provost who will appreci-
ate the work of the last 15 years,
which helpedto make Pitt a top
research university.

But the new provost will need
to ﬁnd a balance between grad-
uate—leve1 research and under-
graduate education, Shull said.

“We need to focus on the kind
of teachers we have in under-
graduate studies and the quality
of programs,” he said.

. He pointed out that much
. of Pitt’s budget and most‘ of the
student body come from under-
graduate programs.
Curran said the committee
seeks a provost who would be
“really committed to the ‘Uni-
versity,” rather than looking at

her career.

periences living in Pittsburgh.

Once or twice per year, representatives
from the Mexican Consulate in Philadelphia
would come to Pittsburgh so people could
renew their passports and visas, Rico—Guti-
errez said. During the ﬁrst few years, there
was no line to do anything, but the last time
he tried to renew his passport, there was a
line of about 100 people.

“I would not call the Mexican community
in Pittsburgh large, but it’s a tight—knit com-
munity,” he said. “There is a lot of Mexican
pride and identity.”

Kathleen DeWalt, director of Pitt’s Center
for Latin American Studies, agreed with Ri-
co—Gutierrez’s ideas about Cinco de Mayo.

“It’s kind of a mystery why the holiday is
so popular here, considering that it’s only
a minor holiday in Mexico,” she said. “My

speculation is that it fell at exactly the right‘

time of year for a party. I’ve been in Mexico
on the ﬁfth of May, and the celebrations are
considerably more tame, smaller.” g

It is unclear exactly how many will cel-
ebrate Cinco de Mayo in Oakland, but if the
number of specials advertised at local bars
serve as any indication, residents can ex-
pect an alcohol—ﬁlled night, if they are 21
or older.

Mad Mex will open two hours early to-
day — at 9 a.m. — to serve egg and sausage
burritos. Bartender Eddie Riddell said the
restaurant will have specials on Mexican

beer and margaritas all day.

Mad Mex is not the only Oakland spot
planning Cinco de Mayo celebrations. Many
bars near campus are participating in a bar
crawl sponsored by Dos Equis beer. The
bars will offer specials on bottles of Mexi-
can beers. Party goers can also expect a visit
from the Dos Equis Girls.

“We will all certainly beneﬁt from the hol-
iday if we use it as a platform to share food,
music and other traditions,” DeWalt said.
“Students can learn by reaching out to the
Mexican and Latin American student groups
on campus —— a grassroots approach.”

Pitt junior Lee Rihtarchik, a neuroscience
major, discussed Cinco de Mayo traditions
with his roommates on Monday.

“I don’t really know much about the holi-
day to be honest,” said Rihtarchik, who is
of neither Hispanic nor Mexican descent.
“I’ve heard that it’s not even celebrated very
much in Mexico. Maybe it’s just American
tequila companies trying to make some ex-
tra cash.”

Rihtarchik sees the holiday on the same
level as St. Patrick’s Day or Oktoberfest.
Such holidays are not just about boozing
or partying, but about taking on another
culture for a day.

“It’s good to step out of your own shoes
every once in a while,” he said. “Having fun

,can be the best way to learn and relate to

other cultures.”

New alums meet new world

Graduation 4 1

engineering school, took the stage before 3
p.m. He addressed a variety of subjects, from
cyber security to the nature of life.

During the ceremony Pitt police were
occasionally visible in the crowd -— though
security did not intrude on the proceed-
ings.

Pitt spokesman john Fedele said Pitt
police-were “hyper—vigilant” after hearing
about a bomb scare that happened during
the Pittsburgh Marathon earlier that day.

Former Student Government Board mem-
ber Lance Bonner spoke brieﬂy toward the
end, after Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
asked him several weeks ago to address the
graduates.

Rather than talk solely about academics,
Bonner tried to ﬁnd what brought all Pitt
students together.

“The difﬁcult thing about commence-
ment is that it is not only undergrads,” he
said. “There are grad students there, too.
We all do different things.”

Many people focused on the academic
side of commencement, Bonner said, “but
there are athletes sitting right there.

“Athletics is something that unites ev-
erybody at Pitt,” he said.

Bonner, after thanking everyone at the

ceremony, talked about some of the achieve-
ments that students had made in the past
four years at Pitt, like the ﬁrst men’s basket-
ball N o. 1 ranking last year, and Pitt football’s
victory at the Meineke Car Care Bowl in
December. ,
Many of the students had mixed feelings
about graduating and the ceremony itself.
. Elijah Rawls, who graduated with a de-
gree in economics, looked excited after get-
ting his degree.
“It feels good,” Rawls said. ‘»‘It feels real
good and scary at the same time.”
All of the effort to reach the ceremony,
and to ﬁnish ﬁnals, still hadn’t “hit” Mans-
ﬁeld yet.

“I don’t feel any different,” Mansﬁeld I

said. “Once fall comes and I don’t have to
buy any books, maybe I will.”

Mansﬁeld said he intended to take the
yearoff and move out of Pittsburgh before
going to graduate school, he hasn’t decided
where yet.

“We have a good exit strategy,” he said
of his and his friends’ leaving Pittsburgh.
“We’ll leave before we hate it.”

Interns’ rights

Since state labor officials in Oregon and California have examined the legality of unpaid in-
ternships, interns have more clout to argue that stirring coffee and un-jamming copy machines
shouldn’t be part of their job description.

The U.S. Department of Labor recently created a list of six points that outlines qualiﬁers for
legal unpaid internships.

A dedicated intern could be inclined not to complain when it comes to monotonous jobs that
are of questionable value, yet poor performance at an internship could hurt career goals.

Fortunately, someone’s standing up for the often—helpless intern.

Before, the intern had to suck it up. Now, one of the department’s regulations says that an
internship is designed to beneﬁt the intern — not the company.

With the turbulent economy, these regulations come at an important time. Some companies

- are creating more unpaid internship positions because they’re monetarily costless. Fifty percent

of graduating college students held internships in 2008, up from 17 percent in 1992; according
to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, The New York Times reported.

While the economy might be turning around, employers who’ve created more unpaid intern
positions have more reason to put interns to" work and see that they work hard.

If they’re doing legitimate jobs — as they legally must — the experience becomes almost
certainly one where the intern will learn. If the intern works and learns more than how his boss
likes his coffee, he’s more than just a source of free, menial help, and that’s exactly how the in-
ternship should be. ~

Steamy nights

No commitment, no condom? Not likely.
‘Friends with beneﬁts’ is a popular relationship status on a college campus. It offers compan-
ionship and sexual favors without the monetary cost, time or commitment of a monogamous

relationship. Acollege environment offers a plethora of-potential candidates, so being tied ~

down in a relationship can seem unappealing.

A CNN article warned that these non-romantic hook ups can lead to higher transmission
of sexually transmitted diseases, suggesting that those in uncommitted relationships are
likely to have several partners at the same time.

According to the article, those in romantic relationships were more likely to be monogamous,
renderingthem less likely to contract an STD. However, a study quoted in the article found
that 17 percent of women and 8 percent of men said their partners had cheated on them. Even
in a committed relationship, you can never be too careful when it comes to sexual health.

Those in a monogamous relationship, aware and trusting of their partner’s sexual history,

T might be more lax about protection, increasing their likelihood of STDs if their partnerswas

unfaithful —— making those in an exclusive relationship just as, if not more likely, to contract

* an STD.

We’re hoping students will take this as a reminder that whether you’re “friends with ben-

I eﬁts” or practically married, protection in a college environment ﬁill of temptations is key.

‘Diary ’ sheds insight into body—c0nsci0us female mind

   

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Just before we got dumped by Em-
ily Twiggs, we stole her diary so we
could learn her innermost thoughts
and thereafter devise a way to get back
together with her. Unfortunately, the
most interesting entry we found in

there was this one, which we’ve de- ‘

cided to republish in its entirety in lieu
of writing an original column:

“Dear best diary ever, this is your
friend Emily again. After a crazy holi-
day season, where my friends always
had to text me up on my celly because
I was never at home, I realized that
I had gained some weight in all the
wrong places.

This one stupid gym mullet I work
with told me that I should do some
weightlifting to burn calories and build
muscle. Well, according to Wikipedia
and my intuitive understanding of how

my body works, I can’t lift weights. If _

I started doing that, I would get super
bulky and disgusting. I mean, Jessica
Biel’s shoulders, anyone? Ugh‘ factor
times 10! _

Anyway, the typical exercise rou-
tine for a no-nonsense modern girl
like me consists of using an elliptical
trainer, often for hours at a time, at
that machine’s lowest setting. I try to
set the machine to the highest incline
possible, so that I can hang on for dear
life with my forearms and do even less
work than I would be doing otherwise.
This is the only acceptable way to use
the elliptical trainer, as it allows me to
avoid developing sweat. stains on my
hot new Victoria’s Secret Pink athletic
pants while I skim the latest issue of
Cosmo or Self for pertinent informa-
tion about beach diets and the latest
trends in objectifying outerwear.

If I arrive at the gym and all of these
trainers are occupied — undoubtedly
by other women who have been using
them for hours or possibly even days
— there is nothing for me to do but

stand around and wait. During these '

times, I can catch up on the latest gos-

sip and commiserate with the other
single ladies who have gained a few
pounds in undesirable places. Even
though we are probably surrounded
by free weights and weight machines,
we won’t use.them. If I so much as my
wrap my ﬁngers around a barbell, I
just know that I will develop a ripped
physique that conjures up memories of
a young Duane ‘The Rock’ Johnson.

If I spend hours at a gym waiting in
line for an elliptical trainer but don’t
actually exercise, I’m still entitled to
brag to my friends about my grueling
workout. ‘Oh, I deserve this Choco
Taco,’_ I can say, even if I didn’t burn a
single calorie. My galpals will nod their
heads in approval, because, after all,
what woman doesn’t deserve a Choco
Taco? ‘Girlfriend, spoil yourself,’ one
of my friends will usually add.

Life is tough for me, dear diary. I
know this and so do you. If I don’t get
the body I deserve, I will never impress
the other girls I want to impresslwith
said well—deserved body. In much the
same way that men develop biceps to

impress other men, I work out so that

I can cultivate the rail-thin body that
most men find terribly unattractive.
However, it will take tremendous
dedication to a fad diet and countless
years spinning slowly on the elliptical
trainer to reach such a state of per-

fection. Thankfully, I don’t have an.

ounce of muscle on my skinny—fatty
frame, just a few pounds in all the
wrong places. Some women, cursed
from birth with bulkiness, will have
to settle for having physical features
that many men ﬁnd attractive.
_ Now why on earth would any wom-
an want that, dear diary?
Wishes for a great summer,
E.”

dent of the Women’s Elliptical Trainer

When counting the countryseems crazy

President Obama’s decision to only declare one race on his census is indicative of the nation’s need for labels

 
  

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

About a month ago, I began get-
ting notices in the mail about the
U.S. Census and how it was very im-
portant that I_ﬁll out and return the
attached form. Naturally, I looked it
over, left it in my living room, and
eventually threw it out.

But after several of these en-
velopes ended up in the trash,
I guess the government decided
that my roommates and I were
important enough to warrant an
in—person census at my front door.
The whole thing lasted less than 10
minutes — and frankly it probably
wouldn’t have taken long to ﬁll out
and mail back. But even though the
whole thing was a painless process,
there’s one section of the Census

that still irks me — checking in

ethnic background.

Recently there’s been a bit of
controversy over the choice that
President Barack Obama made re-

garding his race. In that section, he
. selected “black, African—American

or Negro” and nothing else. For‘

those of you still playing by the
one—drop rule, this wouldn’t have
raised any eyebrows.

But for others, Obama’s rejec-
tion of his option to also select
“white” or “some other race” seems
out of character for someone who
has made no secret of his mixed
racial background. Obama’s mother
and grandparents raised him in Ha-
waii, and he barely saw his Kenyan
fatherduring that time.

A Washington Post article quot-
ed the president as saying, “I self-
identify as an African-American.

race, than he could his white grand-
mother. He seems to have done just
that. ,
Additionally, Obama’s identi-
ﬁcation with»African-Americans
hasn’t always been so strong. In his
memoir, “Dreams from My Father,”

~ he even speaks of his uncomfort-

That’s how I am treated and that’s ,

how I am viewed and I’m proud
of it.” (And I take it he identiﬁes
with all black Americans, not just
those from Africa or those who
have ethnic ties to Africa). But in
his acclaimed 2008 speech, Obama
said that he could no more disown
the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who had
made controversial remarks about

able encounters with other black

students during his time at Occi-
dental College. As someone who
didn’t share their experiences in
inner city Los Angeles, he felt iso-
lated during events run by black
student groups. p '

Perhaps this was Obama’s at-
tempt to disprove critics like
“The Boondocks” creator, Aaron
McGruder, who questioned how
black the President really was
during his run_for office". But that
seems unlikely since Obama’s ap-
peal seemed to be based on his in-
clusiveness and ability to relate to
people of all backgrounds.

But I don’t think Obama was try-
ing to make a statement regarding
how black he was. He’s as much a

victim of the desire to neatly cat-
egorize our population as any other

, American.

Even as someone who isn’t of
mixed ethnic background, to me,
the U.S. Census still has issues with
its presentation of race. When I was
asked to select the category that
best represented me, I chose “Asian
Indian.”

Yet, there are many different
subcategories of “Asian Indian”
that are present within this larger
umbrella term. People who come
from India, like me, India often
categorize themselves as being
from distinctive ethnic groups —
Bengalis, Tamils, Gujaratis — with

their own special languages and
, customs.

Believing that such a category is

. an appropriate one is akin to saying

that people from Egypt and South
Africa can effectively be viewed as
simply African, as if such a term
linked them through anything
more than geography.

At the end of the day, everyone

Whafr do sunken oi! rigs and Glenn Beck have in common?

A checkmark on aform isn’t asking
Americans to abandon whatever

Starting this week in Pitts-
burgh, gyros, phyllo dough and
baklava are in season —— Greek
food festival season, that is.

Oakl’and’s St. Nicholas Greek
Orthodox Cathedral kicks off a
summer showing of Pittsburgh’s
Mediterranean community with
its 49th annual Greek Food Fes-

tival.

Throughout the summer,
Greek Orthodox churches in the
area, like the North Side’s Holy
Trinity and Mount Lebanon’s
Holy Cross, hold Greek food fes-
tivals to show off their culture.

According to Holy Trinity fes-
tival organizer, Chris Balouris,
the festivals help spread Greek
culture within the churches’ com-
munities and outside of them in
addition to being some of the
churches’ largest fundraisers.

“It really helps non—Greeks
understand our culture and food
and learn a little bit about us,”
he said.

St. Nicholas’ festival is the
first and easily the largest Greek
festival in the Pittsburgh area,

‘ElmStreet’ remake Won’t keep

The new Freddy Krueger may be up to his old tricks, but he fails to make any real impact

Kieran Layton much like a dream or a nightmare.

For The Pitt News

“A Nightmare on Elm Street”
Starring: Jackie Earle Haley,
Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy

Director: Samuel Bayer

New Line Cinema

Grade: C+

Well, Freddy’s coming for you
once again, and though he has afresh
coat of latex burns, he isn’t anything
you haven’t seen.‘

“A Nightmare on Elm Street” is
yet another horror movie remake
that takes the tried and true genre
concept of a famed villain killing

‘ pretty teenagers and giving it a fresh

coat of paint and some MTV genera-
tion editing.

While the ﬁlm does a decent job
at providing an hour and a half’s
worth of cheap thrills and visceral
entertainment, it will leave only the
faintest mark on your memory —

b Unlike slasher ﬂicks such as “Fri-
day the 13th,” “Halloween” or _“The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” the orig-
inal “A Nightmare on Elm Street”
provided the interesting dream ele-
ment that allowed for more creativ-
ity with the kill sequences.

The device of Freddy only exist-
ing in the teenager’s dreams meant
he was a more elusive, more om-
niscient being. Plus, the notion of
not letting oneself fall asleep for fear
of being maimed by Freddy’s knife
ﬁngers was just cool.

So perhaps more than any other
horror remake, the new “N ight—
mare” translates especially well to
a generation that often runs on Red
Bull and Adderall.

The story remains pretty much
in tact from the original. A group-of
teenagers begins to have dreams that
include growling murderer Freddy
Krueger. When the teenagers liter-
ally begin to die intheir dreams (and
reality), they realize that they prob-

ably shouldn’t fall asleep.

Easier said than done, however.
The ﬁlm becomes a race against ex-
haustion and micronaps.

Many of the iconic images from '

the original pop up in the remake,
too. The knife-covered hand emerg-
ing from the water while a girl is tak-

ing a bath? Check. Freddy’s twisted
visage coming out of a wall? Still
here, though the CGI cheapens the
effect. .

Perhaps the greatest thing that
the remake has done is include the
ﬁlm’s memorable twist of character
focus. '

you up

Without giving too much away,
the character whom the audience
assumes will be the lone survivor
by the end, according to the rules of
horror ﬁlms, dies halfway through
the ﬁlm, shifting the focus to another
character for the remainder of the
movie. It’s a nifty concept that keeps

Greek fest hits Oakland

Greek 4 7

serving thousands of people dur-
ing its ﬁve days.

This is the Rev. Demetrios
Gardikes’ first festival with the
St. Nicholas parish.

“It’s a lot of fun. We have a live
band and entertainment every
night. It’s a real joy to seeithe
children dancing, some as young
as 5,” he said.

The festival is in a large indoor
dining room and features an a
la carte menu with traditional
foods like beef stefatho, baklava,
spanakopita and imported Greek
wine, as well as an outdoor grill
featuring gyros and chicken on
a pita.

Like most other festivals in the
area, the church’s parishioners
make all the food, and with ﬁrst

 

and second—generation Greek im-
migrants manning the kitchen,
festival food is some of the most
authentic found in Pittsburgh.
“If you were to go to an‘Athens
taverna, you’d see the same things
on the menu,” parishioner and
cook Elaine Andrianos said. “And
you know, having been there, I
actually think ours is better —
more homemade, at least.”
Preparation for St. Nicholas’

festival began in January when ‘

the cooks, mostly retired parish-
ioners and senior citizens, began
baking and freezing the food.

In the church’s kitchen, the
bilingual and bicultural environ-
ment is slowly changing. The ﬁrst
and second generations are be-
ginning to see third—generation
church members getting involved
with all aspects ofthe festival and
Pittsburgh’s Greek community.

Ages of workers and cooks at
the festival range from 16 to 80.
Many members of the older gen-
eration are glad to. see younger
people taking up the Greek tra-
ditions and sharing them with
festival patrons.

“I feel an obligation to carry
on -the tradition. We’re going
strong and proud of it,” Andria-

 

nos said. “We’re very anxious to
extend our Greek hospitality to
our patrons.” ‘

Next year will be St. Nicho-
las’ 50th annual Greek food fes-
tival. Though the parish hopes to
outdo previous years’ festivities,
its members aren’t thinking too
much about details just yet.

“Let’s just get through this
year first,” Gardikes said with

a laugh.

When hundreds of people
gather to watch a band play a

must be extraordinary.

With these sorts of moments,

The most important change in the new

Freddy.

Haley does an admirable job trying to ﬁll those
shoes. He comes off a bit more seriously than
the script seems to call for, but with the added
twist that the new Freddy was a child molester
instead of a child murderer, it’s appropriate.

Ultimately, “Nightmare” will not keep you

Meg’s awkward and mysterious shy-
ness, for instance, comes on particu-

. larly strong in scenes where people are

conversing, during which Meg stares off
into space and gives infrequent, quiet
responses.Jack, on the other hand, tries
to tackle the challenges of success, which
have been building since the band’s in—
ception. V .

The film also showcases the band’s
perso‘nality_through creative cinematog-
raphy. During an. interview, Jack remarks
that the band revolves around “storytell-
ing, melody and rhythm.” Malloy realizes
this and uses a mixture of black-.and—white

footage, grainy shots, red static transi-
tions and raw, candid pictures toecho
The Stripes’ image and music.

It’s rare to find a rock ’n’ roll docu~
mentary that’s both modest and ambi-

duce them.

Jack and Meg White’s unique sound
resonates through clips of their electri-

Perhaps more importantly, the small,
intimate interactions between the two
members ensure that the ﬁlm is worth

4 Baseball team splits doubleheader again

lift holds own in shortened series

st top—ranked Connecticut, third game rained out

Head coach J oe Jordano talks with an umpire. He will be inducted to the Erie chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame next month.

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Panthers baseball hoped to take
the top spot in the Big East this
weekend, but the team never had
a real chance. .

The rain shortened the Pan-
thers’ series against top—ranked
Eﬁnnecticut, and the teams split
a Saturday doubleheader before
the ﬁnale was canceled on Sunday
because of rain. "

This was Pitt’s biggest series
of the season to date, and it held
sg-Qrve against one of the top teams
in the country, increasing the Pan-
thers’ chances of getting an NCAA
Tournament berth.

The No. 24 Panthers (31-11, 13-4
Big East) lost the ﬁrst game 11-7
as junior pitcher Corey Baker had
{in uncharacteristically poor start,
giving up eight runs on 12 hits in
ﬁve innings.

But, despite being down 8-1, a
four-run rally in the sixth helped
put Pitt back in the game. Consecu-
-give doubles by Cory Brownsten,

Zach Duggan and John Schultz,
followed by ajoe Leonard triple,
made it 8-5, ending Huskies ace

 

Elliot Glynn’s day early.

Despite scoring two more runs,
the Panthers’ rally fell short as No.
13 Connecticut (35-9, 14-3 Big East)
added three more. Yet, Pitt Coach

Joe Jordano was encouraged with
the offense’s performance in the
loss. .
5 “I thought we did a solid job
against Connecticut. Glynn was
tough and we were a little impa-
tient early in the game, but once
we settled down, we put up some
runs,” he said. “We just got behind
in the game and could not catch

up.” .

Yet, in game two, Pitt never had
to catch up as it jumped out to a
quick 3-0 lead after two innings
onits way to a 13-4 win.

Everyone in the lineup collected
at least one hit. Duggan went 3 for
5 with four RBIs while hitting his
second homerun of the season.
Leonard continued his All-Amer-

ican-type season scoring three .

runs and going 3 for 5 to raise his
Big East-leading batting average
to .452.

“Game two we did a good job
against (Connecticut pitcher Greg)
Nappo,”Jordano said. “Connecti-
cut has the best ERA in the confer-
ence and to put up 20 runs in two
games is a solid day.”

Meanwhile, sophomore pitcher
Matt Iannazzo held the Huskies
in check as he pitched a complete

game giving up nine hits with four

strikeouts. ‘
“Matt pounds the zone and

pitches to contact,” Jordano said.

“He has a great defense behind

him and he lets them do their job.

He generally throws three pitches-

for strikes and mixes those pitches
well.” ,

First baseman’David Chester hit
two home runs, giving him 10 this
season to lead the team.

The rainout on Sunday allowed
Louisville to jump a half game ahead
of Pitt into second place in the Big
East‘ as they swept Rutgers.

, But no matter where the Pan-
thers ﬁnd themselves in the stand-
ings, their mentality won’t change
as they head into some pressure-
packed games late in the seasons.

“As we have said all year, we ap-
proach every game with the same
mindset,” Jordano said. “We play
our game to the best of our abili-
ties each day. We will continue that
approach this week and until the
last game of the season.”

The Panthers will host Akron
today at 6 p.m. at Trees Field. This
weekend they will travel to Seton
Hall for a three-game series.

SOFT BALL

Pitt splits with Syracuse

, _ Lauren Kirschman

Senior Sta_ﬂ"Writer‘

F‘ The Pitt softball team settled for a split
° with Syracuse this weekend, as rain washed
out the series~ deciding game. A
In the ﬁrst game, the Panthers fell 8-0,
managing only one hit off Orange pitcher

’ ‘ “Jenna Caira.

*3 “She’s a great pitcher,” Pitt head coach

"50Holly Aprile said of the opponent’s pitcher.

*1‘ “She has a great changeup. We didn’t make

good contact, and we only had one hit. It’s

tough for us to win that way.”
Caira’s performance was noteworthy, but
' it was Pitt’s defense that decided the game. In
the sixth inning, the Panthers gave up seven
1 runs off six hits and committed one error.
The inning put the game out of reach for the
Panthers. A I
Syracuseis Caira helped her own cause
*7 1‘ with an RBI single .to left ﬁeld, and then her
*1‘ 'teammate, Stacy Kuvvik, brought in two run-
3 ners withadouble. Meghan Boston singled up
” the middle for an RBI, and a Pitt error allowed
' Kelly Saco to reach base and bring in a runner.
Later in the inning, Syracuse’s Veronica Grant

scored two with a single.
:1 I

“We were uncharacteristically pooron de-

fense, and we had a letdown on the mound,” ’
 coach Aprile said.“We’re usually pretty good

in those areas.” ‘

Aprile said Pitt’s pitcher Cory Berliner
started well but had a breakdown around the
ﬁfth inning. Kayla Zinger came in to ﬁnish
the game for the Panthers midway through
the sixth inning. ~

In the second game, Aprile said, the Pan-
thers performed much better offensively
and defensively, as they defeated the Orange
4-0. at

“Syracuse is a solid hitting team,” Aprile

said. “We held them down nicely in the second‘

game. I’m happy with our response.” .
Freshman catcher Holly Stevens hit her
10th homerun of the season, a record for a
Pitt rookie, and is now third overall on the
single—season homerun list.
“It’s impressive to see afreshman come in

and take charge,” Aprile said. “She calls the

games. She’s developed a good relationship
withlthe pitchers. She’s very steady — not a
lot gets to her, and that’s helpﬁil, especially
offensively.” r

Aprile said that although Stevens struggled
in_a few games, she is always quick to recover,

which helps her both offensively and defen-

sively.

Stevens’ homerun came in the
fourth inning and brought in half of
Ii‘-.t..t,.’s runs. She hit the long ball after
Pitt’s Ashley Amistade reached base
with a single.

The Panthers added two more
runs in the sixth inning, when Ste-
vens brought inAmistade again, this
time with a single to center ﬁeld.
Later, Stevens scored off Reba Tutt’s
double to right-center.

Pitt had seven hits in the game.
Panthers pitcher Alyssa O’Connell
struck out seven in the win as she
recorded her third shutout of the
season.

“She’s got back on track with
this game.” Aprile said. “She was
less than stellar for a few games,
but she’s made great improvement,
great strides. It looks like she’s back

a on trac ”

She said it’s good to see O’Connell
pitching well as the Panthers enter
their last series of Big East play after
a doubleheader with Robert Morris
today.

Pitt plays Rutgers in Piscataway,
N.]., on May 8 and 9.

The Panthers are currently in
sixthplace in the conference, and tlie
top eight teams qualifying for the Big
East tournament. The Panthers are a
halfgame behind Providence.

The Panthers haven’t clinched
their postseason spot yet, and Aprile
said staying in qualifying position
will hinge on the aspects of the game
Pitt depended on all season.

“We need to pitch well and play
good defense,” Aprile said. “If we are
good on the mound and on defense,
we are tough to beat.”

The secret art of goalie taunting

Tony breaks downs the do ’s and don’ts of verbal abuse by fans

_ Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

Let’s talk hockey.

No, not about the astonish-
ing way the Washington Capitals
lost to the Montreal Canadiens,
nor about the Penguins’ chances
against Montreal.

I want to talk about something
far more important — goalie
taunting.

The goalie taunt is something that is

Last week, during Game Four of
the Eastern Conference Quarterﬁ-
nals series between the Penguins
and the Ottawa Senators, the Ot-
tawa crowd began taunting Pen-
guins goalie Marc—Andre Fleury
right off the opening faceoff. He
hadn’t even faced a shot.

It didn’t work. Fleury never let
in a goal until the Penguins safely

unique to hockey -—-— but it is being
abused. It’s getting out of control,
and I am beginning to question its

usefulness.

It’s a staple in hockey, when the
home crowd taunts the opposing
goaltender by chanting his name
in a sing—song manner, elongating
the.two syllables of his name or
nickname. '

One of my fondest memories
at a Penguins game is from Game
Four of the 2009 Stanley Cup Fi-
nals. The Penguins had just put
three goals past Detroit’s Chris
Osgood in less than 10 minutes to
take a 4-2 lead. Seventeen thou-
sand white-clad fans all stood up
singing “Osss—good, Osss—good.”

The goalie taunt is something
that is’ unique to hockey -— but it
is being abused.

It’s getting out of control, and I
am beginning to question its use-
fulness.

had a 4-0 lead. The Penguins won
7-4.

This isn’t unique to Ottawa — it
even happens at Penguins games.
When the opposing team allows
the Penguins to score a power-play
goal, some fans taunt the goalie.

Perhaps this is because nobody ”

has ever come up with clear—cut
rules for goalie taunting. So I will
now do the hockey world a favor.

I present to you, Goalie Taunt-
ing Etiquette.

The opposing goalie shall be
taunted for the following reasons
only:

—If he lets in a particularly soft
or embarrassing goal (such as
when New _]ersey’s Martin Bro-
deur scored on himself in the 2003
Stanley Cup Finals).

-If he allows several goals in a
short period of time (such as when
Washington’s Semyon Varlamoy
allowed the Penguins to score two
goals in eight seconds). 

—If he has a particularly unique
rivalry with the home team or the
home team’s goalie (such as the
rivalry between Patrick Roy and
Chris Osgood). g

—If he trips and fall
while entering the rink. ~

‘The opposing goalie
shall never be taunted in
the following scenarios:

-Prior to or directly af-
ter the opening faceoff. ’

—Before allowing a
goal. . .

-After allowing a pow-
er-play goal or a ﬁve—on-
three goal, unless it was 
particularly soft goal. _'

-During a shootout. If
the goalie is good enough to make
it to the shootout overtime period
of a game, then he does not deserve
to be taunted (Though, Henrik
Lundqvist vs. Brodeur in a 0-0 tie
game is an exception for the rivalry
reasons listed above).

There, now the hockey world
can be on the same page when
it comes to a unique aspect of
hockey.

Happy taunting.

And no, I still haven’t ﬁgured
out a way to taunt Montreal’s]aro-
slav Halak — his last name just
isn’t tauntable. Perhaps it’s for the
best. Pens fans should be buying
him a beer for eliminating the
Washington Capitals rather than
taunting him — unless he stones the
Pens like he did the Caps. 3
