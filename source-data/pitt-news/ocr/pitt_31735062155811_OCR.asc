‘Confront Changing CW/orld ’,
Religion-in-Life W/eels: Theme

By RUTH HEIMBUECHER .
Flying saucers and p-olitics, skyscrapers an ideologies,
gang wars and psychology-—-all of these mold and re—shape
the shifting patterns of every-day life. ,
' “I Confront a Changing World,” theme of this year’s

seventh annual Religion—in—Life conference, will attempt to

A
T‘

encompass these elements.

“Our problem,” says chairman
Paul Schrading, “is to look at these
changes as they exist in the vari-
ous fields of living and see how
oun religious perspective changes
with them, and where we stand in
relation to them.” ’

Speakers Diversiﬁed

Speakers for the three—day con-

ference, Feb. 22—24, have been
chosen from many professions,
from advertising to medicine.
. Emphasis this year is on speak-
ers from the Pittsburgh area’, al-
though prominent out-of—town
speakers have been invited, as
well as Pitt faculty members in
philosophy, chemistry, languages,
history, education and political
science.

Formal opening of the religious
conference will take place‘- at a
tea for speakers and leaders at
Chancellor and Mrs. Rufus H. Fitz-
ge1'ald’s home on Sunday, Feb. 21.

Classes Dismissed \

The program moves to the Pitt
campus Monday, Feb. 22, when
Rabbi Solom Freehof of Rodef
Shalom Temple opens the confer-
ence with the convocation address
in the Commons Room at 10:30
a.m. All classes in the undergradu-
ate schools have been dismissed

‘so that students may attend the

convocation.

As in former years, Religion—in-
Life will be made up of classroom
presentations, in which speakers
will address students on a subject
relating to their class work or in
relation to the theme; informal
discussions and ﬁreside chats; fra-
ternity, sorority, and denomina-
tional meetings, with special
speakers invited; and panel dis-
cussions.

The conference will close with
a dinner on Wednesday night, at
which officers for next year’s Re-
ligion-in-Life will be elected.

'First Conference in ’48 _

Religion-in-Life was ﬁrst held
at Pitt in 1948. It was a small
affair then, with only one outside
speaker, and a budget of approxi-
mately $100. , '

Each year the conference has
seemed to grow in scope, until this
year the program encompasses the
interests of the entire campus. The
budget, too, has grown—-to $1250,
underwritten by students, faculty,
and district churches, for the most
part. ,

Following is a partial list of
leaders who have already con-

sented to participate in Religion-
in-Life:
Dr. Shoemaker Speaks

Dr. Samuel Shoemaker, Calvary

Students Divided on Peace.‘
Of Mind Poll; Some Feel it
Idealistic and Unattainable

Peace of mind;—what is it‘? Pitt students‘ interpret it

differently.

In a world of smashed atoms and insecurity, can peace
of mind be achieved? Some Pitt students think so. Others

are not so hopeful.

Here’s what students answered when they were asked,
“Is peace of mind attainable?” '
Mary Dimon, Col. ’57, says, “Yes,O~-~—

by coming closer to others, by
ﬁnding the God in them, and on
the basis of that discovery giving

to them the best in yourself.”

Frustration Necessary

A graduate student in psychol-
ogy, Mike Doering thinks peace of
mind can be attained, but “only if
we act upon goals worthy of our
best and which we really enjoy
trying for. Peace of mind is not
achieved by reducing fear, frus-
tration, worry and anger. If we
do not, suffer from these unpleas-

_ ant states, we have achieved no

peace of mind, only an emptiness
thereof."

Not so optimistic is Elaine Ham-
mel, Col. 5’7. “Peace of mind to
me,” she states, “is complete sat-
isfaction with what yougve got,
what you’ve done, and what you're
going to do. Such a state seems

almost impossible to attain."
Norma Handlos, Ed. ’54, says.
“I think peace of. mind is an ideal
state.‘ Ideals, by their very nature,
must be unattainable.”

Award Will Give Student
A $500 forstudy-Travel Abroad

By ELINORE STONE
IF Council has creater a men’s Study—Travel Scholarship
to be permanently known as the “S” Award and to be

given annually to a junior to

spend a summer abroad.

Similar to the Nationality Room Hostess Awards, which
send one or two girls to Europe each year, the IF Scholar-
ship will give the selected student $500 or more. The exact
amount will depend on money available although it will

never be less than $500.

It has been called the “S”
Award, because the traveling stu-
dent will sail, . see, study and
speak.

All junior men are eligible to
apply for the scholarship to come
each year from the Committee on
Educational Exchange’s funds, fra-
ternity donations, and proceeds of
IF’s annual fall; kick—off dance.
