The Daily Student T

 

could extend 

hours

Mary Mallampalli
Staﬁ” Writer

Late-night studiers may eventually be
able to crack open their books in the
wee hours of the morning at the Hill-
man Library, but not yet.

Pooja Patel, the chair of the Aca-
demic Affairs Committee for the Stu-
dent Government Board, has made
it her primary initiative to work with
Pitt’s administrators to extend the
library’s hours of operation past the
current closing times of 2 a.m. on
weekdays and 10 p.m. on weekends.
The library held a trial run in Octo-
ber, extendingthe closingtime by two
hours, which did not result in the extra
hours becoming permanent.

Patel said the library plans to hold
anothertrial period of extended hours
nextsemesteraround midterm season

to help the library weigh the pros and
cons of extending the hours.

Each weekend in October, library
hours were extended two hours to

midnight. Library staff made rounds"

through the library and counted the
number of students present after 10

p.m. each Friday and Saturday night. ' R

Patel said that duringthe ﬁrstweek—
end, about 50 students were counted
and by the last trial weekend, about
300 students were present duringthe

- extended hours. Butthe amount of stu-
dents present past normal operating-
hours was not signiﬁcant enough to
result in an extension of closing time
forthis semester. V

“We weren’t sure the extension
would happen until a few weeks be-
fore, so a lotwas done to raise aware-
ness later than it should have been,

T—Rav’s

Amy Friedenberger
8: Breanna Durham
The Pitt News Staﬂ"

The nights on the corner of Bates
and Atwood have been a bit
lonelier an_d quieter these past few
months. The corner was usually
ﬁlled with the easygoing sounds
of Bob Marley wafting through
the air as the piquant smell of
barbecue sauce drew the masses
to the wrought-iron fence that
stood between a grill and hungry
people. ‘

Students have been wandering
around the corner during the
weekends, wondering, “What ever
happenedto T-Rav?” Fortunately

    

Barbecue Laba reappear soon

for them, T—Rav’s Barbecue Lab will
return to its salivating customers.
He became involved in a dispute
involving a lease issue that ousted
him from his grill situated on the
corner of the property of the
Sphinx Cafe andHookah Bar. But

he’s trying to solve the problem V

while also looking into new
territory.

Travis Huntley, who is known
widely by his loyal patrons as
T—Rav, served hamburgers, hot
dogs and pulled pork Thursday
through Saturday from 10 p.m.
to 3:30 a.m. The 24-year-old
ﬂipped burger patties and hot
dogs slathered in his homemade
barbecue sauce for two years
without any problems.

But this year, the Oakland Real

Estate Co., which owns the Sphinx
Cafe property, had T—Rav leave the
corner because of lease issues.
Ramy and Amera Andrawes, the
owners of Sphinx Cafe, gave him
permission to set up shop on the
corner without notifyingthe real
estate ‘company. A

The lease for Sphinx Cafe states
that if any changes are made to
the property, including placing
a grill outside of the building,
Oakland Real Estate Co. needs to

‘ be notiﬁed.

, A woman who answered the
phone for Oakland Real Estate
Co. said the company did not have
any comments on the issue. She
declined to give her name several
times and refused to transfer the
call to other people in the ofﬁce

or the president of the company,
Brian Gallagher, to comment on
the matter. S-he said the matter
was a “Sphinx issue.”

The real estate company
found out due to complaints,
said Amera Andrawes. Included
in the complaints were food safety
issues and problems with people
standing outside, some of whom
were intoxicated.

“[Oakland Real Estate Co.]
didn’t know he was there. So that
made them upset, as well,” Amera
Andrawes said.

Andrawes said that the real
estate company only wanted to
make sure that everything was
legal and safe. '

“It’s their property,” she said.

Amera Andrawes said she

supports T—Rav and would like
everything to work out so he can
return, but she doesn’t know
if he will. Ramy Andrawes also
expressed support for T—Rav’s
business venture because of his
popularity. . 7
“Everybody liked him,” Ramy
Andrawes said. “Everybody knew
who he was. A lot of people came
looking for him after he left.”
T-Rav vanished from the street
corner at the end ofthe summer,
leaving students who returned
for classes wondering where he
was. T—Rav’s Twitter account and

know about his leave of absence,
but students felt deprived.

Aerators cut back on water usage, save money

Breanna Durham
Staff Writer

Pitt still wants its students to stay
clean, it just wants them to save
water while doing so.

In August, Pitt welcomed an
eco~friendly change to Litchﬁeld

_ Towers’ bathrooms that cuts down

not only on costs, but water usage,
too.. In conjunction with the Stu-
dent Sustainable Projects Com-
mittee, Pitt’s Housing Department
installed new aerators in every
bathroom sink in the three Tow-
ers dorms, except the end sinks.

Aerators are little circular
devices with holes in them that
decrease the ﬂow of water go-
ing through the sink faucets.
The water that comes through
appears broken up by air, hence
the name.

Faucets in Towers’ sinks pre-
viously let out 2.2 gallons of wa-
ter per minute, whereas the new
ones only let out 0.5 gallons per
minute.

Rachel Meyer, the Sustainabil-
ity Coordinator for the Housing
Department, said water usage will

theoretically decrease by 77 per-
cent because of the aerators.
Meyer compared last Sep-
tember’s water—use data in Tow-
ers with this September’s to get
some idea of how well the devices
are actually working. This data
conﬁrmed that water consump-

tion decreased by approximately _

950,000 gallons, or 20 percent of
water usage, saving $14,000.
“It’s good to have, because

. now we have this data that says

it’s decreasing our water use and
it’s a really inexpensive thing,”
Meyer said.

To prove consistent decrease,
Meyeriplans to compare October’s
water consumption as well.

“This one small idea in Tow-
ers could [have] breadth across
campus,” she said.

Patrick Hefﬂey, the building
superintendent for Litchﬁeld
Towers and Brackenridge Hall,
said that even though he thinks

students haven’t noticed anything i

about the new aerators, “I feel real
good about it.” .

While Hefﬂey thinks that some
students may not have noticed

the change immediately, others
said they see the new aerators on
campus as a positive implementa-
tion.

For one student, the major pull ~

to the new aerators comes from
a personal beneﬁt rather than an
environmental one.

“I don’t care about the envi-
ronment,” freshman and Towers
resident Jason Kohlburn said.
“It’s useful because it increases
the water pressure. If there’s no
water pressure, it doesn’t clean
my toothbrush off properly.”

Freshman and Towers resident
Daniel Goodstein, who was famil-
iar with the aerators because he
has them in his home, said that
full force isn’t always needed for
faucets.

“It’s not like you need enough
force to blast the toothpaste off
the brush,” he said. .

This idea started with Rebecca
Schroeder, the Environmental

Committee chair for SGB. She said »

in an email that the inspiration for
the creation of the Green Fund in
2010 came from her own ideas for
green initiatives and the thought

T-Rav to make surprise. return

T-Rav 4 1

Laura Nizlek, about having to go
the past several months without
T—Rav’s food. “It’s right next to
my house, _and my friends and I
always end up there at the end of
the night.”

Sophomore Kathryn Plummer
was shocked and sad about T—Rav’s

- disappearance.

“My sister came one weekend,
and she asked if we were going to
T—Rav’s, and I said it doesn’t exist
anymore,” Plummer said. “It’s
really sad. T—Rav’s was awesome.
They had the best hamburgers and
hot dogs around.”

But it’s patrons like Nizlek that

I made T-Rav rethink how he would

get his business going again. He

plans to relocate and expand. '

He wants to try and get the lease
situation worked out so he can still
have his grill in South Oakland,
then add an additional location

in central Oakland.

For the past two months,
he’s been waiting for Oakland
Real Estate Co. to respond to a
proposal for him to return to
his former location. He called
on his loyal patrons to post_on
his Facebook and Twitter pages
about their experiences at T—Rav’s
as evidence of his popularity. He
said that by taking T—Rav’s away, it
took away from the Pitt students’
experiences. '

After losing his spot on Atwood
and Bates, T-Rav tried to seek
out a spot on Semple Street,
but plans fell through. Then he
remembered that IGA had a hot
dog stand outside of its business
in past years, but he hadn't seen
it this year. He approached the
owner ofIGA aboutdoing business
there because Oakland Business
Improvement had already

approved for a hot dog stand
outside the store. ‘

“I thought it would be.a fun
thing if it was outside. I think it’s
a nice thing for Oakland,” said Ron
Levick, the owner of IGA.

Things have gone smoothly

since Levick allowed T-Rav to run‘

his barbecue business in front of
IGA.

“All I need is a smaller grill and
a table and I’ll be in front of IGA,”
T-Rav said. ‘

He would like to have the
Sphinx Cafe location for the
weekends and nights, and have
lunch times at IGA and possibly
nights, depending on reception by

_ patrons. But as of now, he can only

commit to being in front of IGA.
T-Rav wouldn’t say when he
would be opening up in front of
IGA, only that it would be in the
near future. He said he wants to

that other students would have
some, too. _

“Aerators were the simplest
and cheapest idea I had, so that’s
the one I went with for my proj-
ect proposal to the Green Fund in
their pilot run,” she said.

The change came as an initia-

tive made by the Student Sus- L
’ tainable Projects Committee, a

committee that reviews green i_ni-
tiatives and manages and pays for
them through the Student Gov-
ernment Board’s Pitt Green Fund. .
The group works on the projects
in conjunction with Pitt admin-
istration.

The Pitt Green Fund currently
exists under the Student Govern-
ment Board Environmental Com-
mittee and is allocated $2,500 a
year from the Student Activities
Fund to ﬁnance projects proposed
by students that will make Pitt’s
campus more sustainable, accord-
ing to SGB Board member Emily
Hoover. ,

Schroeder said the costs for
these aerators are usually around
$2 per aerator sink, but Pitt has
special contracts with certain ‘sup-

in coming

“surprise” everyone. He will be
advertising closer to opening day
so people know.

On hearing that T—Rav’s was
going to return- to Oakland,
Plummer started to grin and
immediately whipped out her
cellphone and started to text.

“I’m telling my friend right
now,” she said excitedly as her
fingers rapidly pressed the
keys. “I’m so excited. That’s
awesome.”

Nizlek said she is excited for
T—Rav’s to come back. It’s not just
the food that is good; she also
enjoys the atmosphere, which is
fostered by T-Rav.

“He’s always singing and
dancing,” she said.

T-Rav said the experience
that he triesto provide is what
brings his customers back. He

pliers so the aerators were bought
in bulk amounts for a price closer

‘ to $1 per aerator. Each Tower_to-

taled about $125-$175.

She received approval from the
committee and the new aerators
found their way to a ﬂoor of Tower
C for a two-month—long'study ear-
ly last summer focusing on signs
of increased. maintenance. When
that proved false and the impact
was found to be effective, the aer-
ators spread to all of Towers.

Schroeder said that while '

there aren’t any concrete plans

to extend the aerator project H

to other buildings, it is likely
that more will be installed be-
cause the current installation
seems to have saveda decent
amount of water. When the new
aerators will be installed and
where they will be placed is still
unknown. —

She also said that she sees the
project as a moral story.

“Love everybody, please love.

is the peace zone.”

“T—Rav’s is going to be the same

which I think reﬂected in the numbers,” Patel
said. “I amsatisﬁed with the progress, especially
now that I appreciate how long change takes.
It’s been a far longer process than I would have
thought possible. At the same time, Iam happy to
see that the administration is receptive to ideas,
and that we have made progress.”

Since she became a college student, sopho-
more Patel has believed Pitt students should have
access to library resources at any time of the
day or night. -

“We are a large research university, and we
deserve the same resources offered at othertop—
ranking schools such as our own,” Patel said,
referring to schools such as Carnegie Mellon,
Michigan State University and Stanford Uni-
versity. “24/7 library hours are implemented in
manyuniversities andlﬁrmlybelieve University
resources and study space should always be avail-
able to our students.”

- With the support of SGB board memberAlex
Zimmerman, Board liaison to the Academic Af-

’ fairs Committee, and other members on the

committee, Patel worked with HillmanVLibrary
administrator Fern Brody, who agreed to allow a
trial period of extended hours of operation.

On any given weekday night, students can be .

seen studying in the nooks and crannies of the
library until they are required to leave at 2 am.
One such student is Kuwar Rajora, a graduate

"V student studying occupational therapy.

“There are so many students studying here

late at night,” Rajora said. “Most students work
part—time jobs duringthe day. Afterthe whole day
is gone you only have the night to study, and you
need a place to go.”

Rajora said he usually stays at the library until

2 a.m., but that he would stay the whole night if A

he could. ‘
One of the main concerns of extending the
library hours of operation is the cost of staff-
ingand keepingthe library runningforalonger
period of time. .
“Whenthe librarywas openlongerin October,
students utilized it more,” said Simone Boykin,

a student worker at the lending desk. “I don’t
think [extending the hours of operation] is a big
deal, but I don’t think we need to be open 24/7.
I would just have to do work more. I did like the
extended hours in October though.”

“I think I’d use it more if it was open later.
I’m a night owl,” said Sarah Pawlik, a junior who
studies nursing. “Because it’s only open until
2 [a.m.], it hinders me using it. By 11 p.m., I’m
tired and don’t feel like going to Hillman if it’s
only going to be open for three more hours. If

_ more people know about it being open longer,

it would be packed.”

Illegally using
ADHD meds unfair

In just about a week, Pitt students
will begin to consume every drink,
snack and chemical that promises
to improve their ﬁnal exam per-
formances. And if coffee and Red
Bull prove insufficient, many will
resort to drastic, often illegal alter-
natives: Adderall and Ritalin.

It’s no secret that non—ADHD
students use ADH_D medications
either to attain a buzz during par-
ties or to improve their focus while
studying. The practice has become
so pervasive that Duke University,
apparently dissatisﬁed with the
existing laws, recently proclaimed
it a form of academic dishonesty.
Other schools have enacted similar
policies.

Unfortunately, policing the il-
legal consumption of these drugs,
according to a recent Washington
Post article, is next to impossible
—- Adderall and Ritalin produce
few visible symptoms and rarely
send users to the hospital. Thus,
deeming their abuse a code—of-
conduct violation will probably
do little to dissuade potential
drug-takers.

That hasn’t, however, kept many
people from encouraging students
to spurn ADHD medications on
ethical grounds. Freshmen are
told during some orientation ses-
sions that using Adderall or Ritalin
without a prescription amounts to
cheating. Duke’s student newspa-
per even likened the practice to
using steroids as a sports player.

We agree. The steroid analogy

is hardlyperfect — for one thing,
steroids necessitate regular, pro-

' longed use to achieve the desired

results, whereas Adderall’s effects
are instantaneous — but we do

think the drugs engender a simi— .

larly unfair dynamic.

Although ADHD medications
are in some ways akin to caffeine
— both stimulate academic per-
formance — they nonetheless
exclusively beneﬁt those willing

to break the law. If a student fares _

exceptionally well on acurved
exam because he took Adderall
during the previous night’s study
session, the entire class suffers.
And even if there isn’t a curve, a
professor can still be led to believe
students understood the material
better than they did.

Of course, Adderall and Ritalin
aren’t magic; excelling on a test
requires intelligence and a tal-
ent for close reading — neither
of which a chemical can impart.
And the drugs have been known
to inspire different reactions in
different people — while they can
boost studying habits, they can
also ﬁxate attention elsewhere.

Nonetheless, we maintain that
ADHD medications bestow a sig-
niﬁcant and unfair advantage on
non-prescribed users. Proclaiming
the abuse of these medications a
code-of-conduct violation is silly
—'— it’s already illegal, and should
thus already be against a school’s
code of conduct. But proclaiming it
an ethical breach is justiﬁable. I

Don’t judge majo
employment rate 1

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Although China has seemingly
little in common with the United
States, one problem unites stu-
dents in both countries: unem-
ployment among college gradu-
ates. In both places, graduates

are not enjoying the beneﬁts a -

degree once imparted.
America’s conversation has

been pretty muted in terms of

speciﬁc solutions to this prob-

lem, and much more muted in‘

terms of actual action. Any de-
bate that does occur typically
concerns itself with increasing
or decreasing federal loan pro-
grams. China, however, with its
typical swiftness and efﬁciency,
recently announced its solution:
Every major will be evaluated in
terms of its unemployed students
two years after graduation. If a
major’s graduate—employment
rate is less than 60 percent for
both years, it’s department either
gets cut or severely downsized.

Many people in America would
probably love to implement this-
policy; Those on the left ‘might

- see it as a perfect example of a

government action speeding"up
market forces to make the coun-
try better. Clearly, the market is
failing in China, with too many

students going into majors with _,

no prospects. China is simply
doing what the market would
eventually do. '

I can also see this plan gain-
ing tractio_n on the right. As in
China, the government here ei-
ther directly or indirectly sub-
sidizes much of our education.

The Chinese 'solution ensures '

we won’t get free rides on the
subsidization — if you want to
spend four years pursing a B.S. in
puppetry with potentially limited

returns, you won’t get a cent of

taxpayer money. _
_Luckily for students in the
least employable ﬁelds — which,
according to census data, are
clinical psychology, ﬁne arts and
United States history — there is
little chance such a plan would

ever be implemented in the U.S.
American federal education
ofﬁcials simply don’t have the
centralized power to implement
broad changes. However, a more

plausible avenue does exist: Sim- ‘

ply cut federal loans to programs
with a certain level of unemploy-
ment.

Although no presidential can-

didate is currently proposing-

this, it would not be a surprising
development. Given the appeal to
both sides and an increasingly
tight federal budget, it.wouldn’t
be out of character for either
Newt Gingrich or Barack Obama
to develop a plan that increases
theeffectiveness of federal dol-
lars in such a fashion.

But appealing as it might
sound -— especially to students
and voters with more-employ-
able majors — the logic behind
this plan ignores the intrinsic
complexity of civilization. Most
good things are obviously ben-
eficial in retrospect, but their
development couldn’t have been

eventually create an environment where
biologists aren’.t needed anyway. But why
should this be rushed if the outcome isn’t

In the U.S., too, we might lose out by

The danger in these top-down decrees
is that unintended consequences, both
positive and negative, are typically what
govern progress. Seemingly shrewd politi-
cians created mortgage tax credits in the
1990s and 2000s because it seemed" like a
sound strategy. They had no idea it would
create a housing bubble. Other techno-
crats —~ with the admirable intention of
' helping the environment — created corn

So before anybody starts cutting cer~

remember that there are unexpected
consequences to everything. Even doing

as de—incentivizing or eliminating “bad”

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND A

‘at

A

  

B; Jeff Ihaza
TAFF WRITER

Since moving to Pittsburgh from
Texas, one aspect of the area’s cul-
ture has eluded me: the obsession
with hockey.

This isn’t to say I don’t appreci-
ate the athleticism of players like
Crosby or Malkin, I just never saw
skating around on ice as a particu-
larly “manly” thing to do.

Several bruises later, I decided
to reconsider my Southern sen-
sibilities. __

“Dig your blade into the ice!”
my friend Liza shouted as I_ﬂopped
around on the cold ice, trying to

‘recover from what felt like my

thousandth fall. ,

After several minutes of stub-
bornness, I heeded this seemingly
impossible tip and found myself
on two feet again. Barely. I quickly
tiptoed my way to the wall of Pen-
guins Pond Ice Skating Rink in the
South Side and struggled through
a lap around the rink.

As the frigid cold of winter falls
upon Pittsburgh, outdoor activities
are few and far between. But ice
skating at any of the two conve-

niently located rinks near campus
is a great option — even if you’ve
never done it before.

For $7—1o for admission and $3
for skate rentals, you can go ice
skating at either Penguins Pond in
the South Side or The Rink at PPG
Place, located Downtown.

The Rink at PPG Placeiopened
twoweeks ago as a_ ‘

the Pittsburgh Amateur Hockey .

League and the Pittsburgh Inter-
scholastic Hockey League, and
both use the ice as a practice fa-
cility. While the rink at PPG Place
will remain open until March,
Penguins Pond will only be open
untiljan. 8.

part of Pittsburgh’s
historic Light Up
Night, when the
60-foot tree in
the center of the
rink was lit in a

are also a bunch of great places to
eat surrounding the rink,” Stoudt
said _

As I quickly found out, ice skat-
ing is a tremendous leg workout.
About two years removed from
my high school athletic days, I
found myself quickly wanting to
give up.

the assistant general manager
at the PPG Ice Skating rink, said
ice skating is a great way to meet
new people and have a great ex-
perience.

“The scenery hereis amazing.

After a short-lived hissy ﬁt, I
was ready to give it another try.
This time, I remained focused and
tried with all my might to keep my
feet together. The sight of a 6—foot-
4 man ﬂopping around and whin-

‘people, all cheering me on.

. “Aw, he’s got it,” a parent said
as I glided by conﬁdently.

It was like the ending of “The
Mighty Ducks.” I was suddenly
skating laps around kids who I
knew had been secretly laugh-
ing at me before. Of course, I got
too conﬁdent and began trying to
dance on my skates while singing
Chris Brown’s “Look At Me Now.”
This ended in my hardest fall.

“Okay, now I’m really over it,” I
said as I crawled off the rink.

Even though I’m not quite
ready to join any amateur hockey
leagues, I left Penguins Pond with
an entirely newfound respect for
the ice. - ‘ _

On the bus ride back to Oakland,
I couldn’t help feeling as though
I’d accomplished something great.
Nothing beats the sense of satisfac-
tion gained after falling so many
times and ﬁnally succeeding. I

MOVIE REVIEW

Scorsese succeeds with imaginative and family-friendly ‘Hugo’

By Brian Dollard
STAFF WRITER

€£Hugo59y

Starring: Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Co-
hen

Directed by Martin Scorsese

Grade: A-

In the labyrinth of gears and levers that
comprise the 1930s Parisian train station
where “Hugo” takes place, the stalled ig-
nition of the movie’s ﬁrst gear is the only
malfunction.

The movie follows a young orphan named
Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterﬁeld) who manually
ﬁxes the hundreds of clocks within the train
station. Naturally inquisitive, Hugo spends
his free time trying to ﬁx the mysterious,
human—like machine left to him by his late
father (Jude Law), hoping its rebuilding will
reveal a secret message from him.

Stealing his meals from shopping carts
and hunting for spare parts, Hugo care-
fully avoids the detection of the notorious
orphan-catching station inspector (Sacha
Baron Cohen) and his menacing mutt. Even-
tually, Hugo befriends the adventurous,
adolescent Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz)
who strangely possesses the heart;shaped
key needed for the ignition of his father’s
machine.

The imaginative ﬁlm serves both as a
children’s tale and a reminder for adults that

‘ creativity doesn’t necessarily diminish with

age. It is a rare breed of family ﬁlm where
both parents and children leave the theater
feeling the movie spoke directly to them.
The happy, uplifting message throughout
the movie makes the viewer suspect an er-
ror with the listing of Martin Scorsese as
the director —- a man famed for his family-

unfriendly ﬁlms like “The Departed” and -

“Taxi Driver.”

But in this movie, strong, universal
themes of individual importance do not
veer too far into sappy, melodramatic ter-

ritory. Hugo’s quest, based on his notion,

that each person has a purpose to serve, is
paired nicely with the many parts required
for nearly all of the ﬁlm’s major objects.
Scorsese’s exploration into a starkly dif-
ferent genre only augments his legend by
avoiding a detraction from prior successes
with a late—career blunder;

Mixing the ﬁction with history, Scorsese
evenly blends the two in “Hugo” by drawing
on the imaginative life of Georges Méliés.
The eccentric career of the early ﬁlmmaker
leads to smooth transition between fantasy
and reality. _ '

However, the ﬁlm does suffer from its
opening sequence, which fails to capture
the audience’s attention after the ﬁrst few

. Once a plot appears, it remains captivating

minutes of intrigue into Hugo’s routine.
Too much time is spent navigating the back
rooms of the train station and adjusting
clocks without building a larger context.

for the entire ﬁlm.

Although the action primarily involves
the‘ two children, Ben Kingsley’s splendid
performance as the sour and aged Georges
Mélies carries the ﬁlm. The contrast be-
tween the character’s Willy Wonka-like en-
thusiasm, witnessed in ﬂashbacks, and the
reality—eroded, unimaginative present ver-
sion showcases Kingsley’s talent as an actor.
His genuine warmth is portrayed through
Georges’ transformation, and his connection
with Hugo propels the movie above just an
average family ﬁlm. -

The ﬁlm’s true service is the homage it be-
stows on the innovators and magicians who
slowly transformed the motion picture from
a novelty to an art form. Scorsese beautifully
transposes images and stories from early
silent movies with the stunning 3-D technol-
ogy of the present. The continued enjoyment
from these tales despite the near-century
gap from their original inception cements
the timelessness of the early cinema.

“Hugo” preaches that every part has a
purpose. This ﬁlm’sp‘urpose is to inspire the
next generation of ﬁlmmakers by reminding
them that ﬁlm truly is a magic trick.

ALBUM REVIEW

Daughtrytkeeps style, including
tired theme ofjilted romance

By Larissa Gula
STAFF WRITER

Break The Spell

Daughtry

Recordings Ltd.

B

Rocks Like: Lifehouse, Hinder

It’s time for the latest installment of
Daughtry’s relationship drama.

Five years after its ﬁrst self—titled al-
bum, American rock band Daughtry has
released Break The Spell. The group’s third
album combines a harder rock sound with
the classic Daughtry music that fans know
and love. "

As always, Daughtry focuses on the pains
and pleasures of relationships. It’s a nice
throwback for fans, but overall it’s boring.
How many times can we listen to songs about
failed relationships‘?

Fortunately, not every track does this.

The album kicks off with a high—energy song
titled “Renegade,” featuring lyrics like, “Can
you hear the sound of the turnin’ wheels /
Burnin’ the road like it’s never been done /
I’m breakin’ out of this town like a‘ renegade
/ So baby, get ready to run.”
A gritty guitar drives the song, keeping
the pace up and adding a level of fun that
will probably make it shine at live perfor-
mances.

 

 

Immediately after this, the song “Craw1—
ing Back To You” highlights the band’s con-
tinued fascination with songs about relation-
ships on the brink. On this track, Daughtry
sings about a man begging a woman to take
him back. It sounds less like “gritty” rock
and more like a typical Daughtry song, with
softer lyrics and a sing—a—long tempo and
chorus. ‘

But lead singer Chris Daughtry adds a
layer of interest when he experiments with
his vocals in this album. He hits higher notes
during songs like “Losing My Mind” than he
had in the past and begins to demonstrate a
softer, more emotional side of himself.

This more emotional side to Daughtry can
be seen on one track in particular. The deluxe
edition of the album features an acoustic
song called “Lullaby.” The chorus goes, “I
can’t wait to see your faces / And I can’t wait
to hold your hands / When you get here, it’s
off to the races / And we’ll tackle all life’s

’ demands / But until I do / Yeah, until I do /

I’ll be right here singing for you.” It’s a soft,
emotional track, with the singer addressing
the children of the future. It stands out as
unique and incrediblyheartfelt on an album
primarily about falling in and out of love.
Overall, this album expands upon the
band’s music without alienating its fans. It’s
a fantastic demonstration of how a band’s
sound can grow and develop over time, even
if the primary topic remains a bit too re-
petitive. % V

After two victories over two top-10
teams in as many weeks, the Pitt
wrestling team is now ranked No.
8 in the nation. 6

The Panthers made a strong
case for becoming a top-10 team
with‘a win at Lehigh on Nov. 12
followed by a win at home against
Michigan on Nov. 19. Both Lehigh
and Michigan were ranked No. 6
at the time ofthe matches. _

) In the victory against Michi-
gan, the Panthers were able to
clinch a 19-13 win on an overtime
takedown by senior heavyweight
Zac Thomusseit.

Thomusseit — who weighsin
at about 210 pounds — overcame
950-pound size disadvantage and
kept the score tied at 1-1 to end
regulation with No. 12-ranked Ben
Apland. 1

“Going into overtime, I was re.-
ally looking to score in that ﬁrst
minute,” Thomusseit said. “I really
didn’t want to take it to a ride-out
with that guy.”

With less than ten seconds re-
maining in the one-minute sud-
den-victory period, Thomusseit
and Apland went into a scramble.
1! was Thomusseit who came out
with a double-leg takedown that
was awarded as time ran out.”The
takedown brought the spectators

Huailei Wang] StaffPhotographer
A Panther wrestler takes down his opponent for a score. Pitt cracked the Top 10 this weekend.

at the Fitzgerald Field House to
their feet as the bout secured a
19-13 Panthers victory.

“That was deﬁnitely one of
the best matches I’ve been a part
of,” Thomusseit said. “Beating a
team as good as Michigan felt re-
ally good. Going into the match,
I was pretty pumped after seeing
my little brother [Max Thomus-
seit] and [Matt] Wilps both pick
up wins. That gave me some mo-
mentum.” ,

The'Panthers’ coaches were

originally unsure if Thomusseit .

was going to wrestle, as both he
and freshman Joel Yahner were
introduced at heavyweight. In the
previous two seasons, Thomus-
seit has had success as a national
qualiﬁer at 184 pounds and 197
pounds.

“You know it’s not all about
size,” assistant coach Jason Pe-
ters said. “Zac [Thomusseit] has
a big heart. He’s a really strong
kid and he has a strong desire to
win. That’s something that can’t
be measured in weight. It’s really
unseen and he has a lot of that.”

The Panthers got off to an early
4-0 lead over Michigan on a 16-5
major decision victory forjunior
Anthony Zanetta. The win brings

. Zanetta to an undefeated 7-0 re-

‘ cord‘kin:the_season. '

“Zanetta really is our Energizer

Bunny,” head coach Rande Stottle-’ 

myer said. “He’s the one that gets
us going, and that’s important.
He can do that whether he wins

or loses, because he just hustles. ‘

He’s a great guy to start a match
for us.”

With Thomusseit at heavy-
weight and a lineup with a total
of seven wrestlers ranked in their
weight classes, the Panthers now
look to maintain their standing
and continue to improve over the
course of the season.

“We have to keep doing what
we do,” Peters said. “We’re going
to keep trying to work hard and
execute what we work in practice‘

and let the rankings take care of -

themselves.”
Against Michigan, sophomore
Max Thomusseit and redshirt se-

‘nior Ethan-Headlee both made

their season debuts ~ injuries
had previously sidelined both
wrestlers. Both Thomusseit and
Headlee are returning national
qualiﬁers. ‘

Max Thomusseit scored a 6-2
decision win to tie the match with
Michigan. Thomusseit is currently
ranked No. 22 in the nation at 184
pounds, according to Wrestlin-
‘gReport.com, after his ﬁrst bout
of the season.

Headlee lost his bout 4-2 to
No. 7 Justin Zeerip. Headlee is

now ranked No. 21 in the nation.

Panthers take 11th
straight City Game

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team used
a balanced scoring attack to win its
eleventh consecutive City Game on
Wednesday night.

Three Panthers reached double
ﬁgures, led by Ashton Gibbs with 18
points, as Pitt defeated Duquesne 80-
69 atthe Consol Energy Centerinﬁont
of 15,880 people —the largest crowd
ever to watch a City Game.

Dante Taylor and Lamar Patter-
son added 15 and 10 points, respec-
tively. Taylor - coming off the bench
as freshman Khem Birch started at
center — also grabbed 10 rebounds.
He ﬁnished 6-6 from the ﬁeld and 3-3
from the foul line.

Taylor, who sat out Pitt’s last two
games because of migraines, saidthat
Watching the rest of the front court
excel during that time served as mo-
tivation to perform well.

“To see those guys come out ofthe
pasttwo games and do good on the in-
side, I deﬁnitely Wanted to come back
and keep that going,” he said.

Taylor said he started suffering
from migraines after getting hit in the
head twice against La Salle, but added
that the headaches have stopped.

Eight Panthers scored at least
eight points in the game, with fresh-
man guardjohnjohnson providing a
spark off the bench. He ﬁnished with
nine points on 3-3 shooting ﬁ'om the
3-point line;

“John Johnson has a real focus
and a real determination that really
impresses me,” Pitt head coachjamie
Dixon said. “He’s going to be a really
good player.”

Duquesne stayed within striking
distance for most the game, mainly
because of its abilitytoforce turnovers.
The Dukes scored 27 points off23 Pan-
ther turnovers.

Pitt forward Nasir Robinson said
that the Panthers need to focus on
making smart decisions and taking
care of the ball. Dixon added that
Duquesne’s style played a role in forc-
ing the turnovers.

“It’s the waytheyplay,” Dixon said.
“We don’t play teams like them. They
overplay, they gamble, they go for

steals in the backcourt. You have to I

beat them on theboards.”

The Panthers did just that, domi-
nating Duquesne on the boards with

16 offensive rebounds to the Dukes’-

15 total rebounds. Pitt ﬁnished with
39 total rebounds.

“They are so long [and] tall. You
got to hit them before they get in the
paint orthey are just going to jump up
and tip it in,” Duquesne guard/forward
'B.J. Monteiro said. “You can’t beat a
team like that if you aren’t rebound-
ing.” V

' Pitt ﬁnished with 18 second-
chance points to Duquesne’s ﬁve.

“[That was] the most physicality
we’veseenallyear, includingArizona,”
Duquesne head coach Ron Everhart
said.

Every time Duquesne pulled close,
the Panthers came up with a big play
— something Everhart noticed.

“I thought every time we had them
in trouble, they would convert with a
big three,” he said. .

The Dukes cut Pitt’s 11-point half-
time lead to fourwith12:47 remaining
inthe game, but Robinson answeredby
scoringhis ﬁrst two points and Gibbs
quickly followed withas-pointer. After
Duquesne’s]eny]ones cutthe hoop for
a layup, Gibbs hit another 3-pointer to
boost Pitt’s lead to 10 points, 58-48.

The Dukes wouldn’t get any closer
than seven points for the rest of the
game, with the Panthers going ahead
by12, 64~52,with 8:03 leftinthe game.
When Duquesne closed the gap to 64-
57 off a Seanjohnsontip-in, Patterson

‘responded with a 3-pointer to boost

the lead back to double—digits with
4:08 remaining.

‘ Robinson extended the lead out
of a timeout, driving to the hoop for
a layup and getting fouled. He hit the
ensuingfoul shot, giving the Panthers
the 70-57 advantage with 3:11 left the
game.

points inthe secondhalf...they made
plays down the stretch that took it
away from us,” Monteiro said.

The Panthers used two scoring
runs to pull away from Duquesne in
the ﬁrst half. After the Dukes jumped
out to a quick 10-5 lead, Pitt used a
10-0 run-—highlightedby3-pointers
from Gibbs andjohnson —— to build a
15-10 advantage.

TASSER’S TAKE

A strong start in Sidney Crosby’s return

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ" Writer

Some feared it would never happen.
He kept the fans waiting, the experts
speculating and the coaches quiet.
The roller-coaster ride of anticipation
climbed and fell, up and back down

again, until many people were tired of .

the waiting and talking and the ever-
present aura of mystery surrounding
the whole situation.

But after 10 long and agonizing
months, The Kid returned. And num-
ber 87 has picked up right Where he
left off. ,

Sidney Crosby is back, and the rest
of the National Hockey League is not
happy about it. In case you’ve been hid-
ing under a rock, Sid the Kid made his
triumphant return to the ice for the
Pittsburgh Penguins after a lengthy
absence brought on by concussions
sustainedin back-to-back games last
December.

Crosby drew the ire of analysts and
players alike during his lengthy absence
and refusal to shed any sort oflight on
the situation, and a rumor that Crosby
would never play again circulated for
some time.

Thank you to The Pitt News R

‘B55: is:  it) y

“Get on the ice, let’s get going,”
former NHL star and Versus analyst
Jeremy Roenick said in October. “Let’s
start hitting. Let’s get back in. I don’t
wanna hear every day, ‘How’s your head?
How’s your head? How’s your head?’ I
don’t wanna watch Sidney Crosby tell
me every single day how there’s noth-
ing new to report.”
Evidently, he was
sick of his own
network inter-
viewing Crosby
about his very dif-
ficult injury.

He wasn’t the
only one, either.
Fans and players
alike grew weary
of hearing about
Crosby’s skills and
injury concerns,
as the NHL made
a point to shove
him down people’s
throats with their marketing campaign
prior to the concussion. They began to
point out his reputation for taking dives
and complaining to officials and started

to label him as “soft.”
But given the attention paid to head .

injuries of late, the wait’ and cautious

approach taken by Crosby and his team
of doctors, trainers and coaches only
seems appropriate.

Crosby’s return was built up so much
it was reminiscent of Penguins’ owner
— and Crosby’s mentor and landlord —
Mario Lemieux’s comeback from retire-
ment as a player-owner back in 2000. In
actuality, it paled
in comparison to
the significance
of “Super Ma-
rio’s” triumphant
return to the ice
— Le Magnifique
scored a goal and
had two assists in
his first time back
after three years in
retirement. But Sid
did manage more
points in his ﬁrst
game back, regis-
tering two’ goals
and two assists.

According to the Elias Sports Bu-
reau, Crosby is off to the best start of
his career, with 11 points via two goals
and nine assists in his first five games
back. This marks the first time he has
reached double-digit points in the first
five games of a season in his career.

   

That’s a whopping 2.2 points per
game, and although it is unlikely tie
will keep up this pace, it will quickly
put him on the board of NHL scoring
leaders. Last season, he was averaging
1.61 points per game and had a com-
manding lead in the scoring race before
his injury. -am

The Penguins made it clear that they
do not need Crosby to be one of the
NHL’s best teams. Buoyed by strong play
fromjames Neal, Jordan Staal and Kris
Letang — all three are projected for
career highs in goals and points, with
Letang also slated for success in assists
and plus/minus — and the notoriously
inconsistent Marc—Andre Fleury, the
‘Pens were surviving without Crosby.

But what team would not want argu-
ably the best player in the game on their
ice, wearing theirjersey? ‘.9

If the Penguins are able to get their
entire team healthy —— Crosby, Evgeni
Malkin, Brooks Orpik and Zbynek Mi-
chalek have all missed signiﬁcant time
—— they will most likely be Stanley Cup
favorites. With Crosby back, Malkin
healthy and Neal producing, their of-
fense will finally catch up with the de-
fense that carried them last year, and
Pittsburgh will be looking at a deep run
in the playoffs. I

He’s returning from three seasons of 20 '

or more wins and three trips to the NCAA

. Championships. .
“It was a pretty big challenge asking them

[Max Thomusseit and Headlee] to step in
for their ﬁrst competition against a top—10
team,” Peters said. “Unfortunately; Ethan
wasn’t able to get the win, but he wrestled
pretty well against a good wrestler.”
Zanetta’s undefeated 7-0 record has been
a welcome surprise, and he is now ranked

_No. 13 in the nation. Zanetta is also a two- ~
time national qualiﬁer, but last season he

got off to a slow start and had a 3-4 record
at this point in the season.

—Jason Peters

Redshirt senior Tyler Nauman currently
holds a record identical to Zanetta’s, as N au-
man has risen in the rankings to No. 3 at 149
pounds. He has become a ﬁxture of success
in the Panthers’ lineup as a three—time, NCAA
qualiﬁer and returning All-American. He
currently has 119 winsas a Panther. _

Redshirt junior Wilps rounds out the list
of Panthers in the rankings, and is now_No. 6
in the country at 197 pounds. Wilps’ 6-2 deci-
sion victory against Michigan’s Max Huntley
was his third victory against aranked op+
ponent this season. 1 -
