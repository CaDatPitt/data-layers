Council passes bill on J&L site

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Council ap-
proved a bill yesterday mark-
ing the first step toward
converting the defunct J&L
steel plant on the South Side
of Pittsburgh into a historic
landmark.

Some members of the Coun-
cil voiced concern that the
LTV corporation, the owners
of the plant, did not have a

‘chance to express their views
on the bill. Representatives of
the LTV corporation pressured
the members of council to re-
commit the bill, but the mo-
tion was defeated 5-4.

Councilman Mark Pollock,
the sponsor of the bill, said, ’’I
don't want to play ’chicken’
with a major corporation.”

Councilman lack Wagner
said that the Council had not
been ”fair” to the LTV corpo-
ration by not allowing them to
present their case to City
Council.

”My No. 1 goal would be to
see steel making on the site,”

said Wagner.

In a letter to the members of
City Council, Arthur Zeigler
Jr., president of the Pittsburgh
Historic Landmark Foundation
said that LTV was trying to de-
lay the historic designation.
The PHLF also runs Station
Square.

‘ 
LTV has not shown

any concern for the city
of Pittsburgh. LTV Will
have the opportunity to
present their case be-
fore the Historical
Commission.

— Michael Coyne
""'j"""" 99
Bob Erickson of the Steel

Valley Authority said they sup-
port the idea of converting the
site into a historic landmark.
Erickson said it would make
an interesting tourist attraction.

Councilman Michael Coyne

said, ”LTV has not shown any
concern for the city of Pitts-

burgh. LTV will have the op-
portunity to present their case
before the Historical Com-
mission.”

Bill Aaronson, a lawyer for
LTV, said, ”The effect of the
vote is to implement a de fac-
to designation.”

Mark Tomasch, A a spokes-
man for LTV, said the compa-
ny is demolishing some of the
buildings on the site because
they are safety hazards.

Tomasch said LTV has been
trying to sell the J&L plant for
the last year and a half.

”To date, there have been
no qualified buyers,” said
Tomasch.

According to the Steel Val-
ley Authority, it will cost over
$200 million to re-start the
plant using continuous casters.

LTV closed down its opera-
tions on the South Side in
1985 when it laid off around
700 workers from its electric
furnace. It had been in decline
for years before then. During
the early 1970s, LTV em-
ployed over 5,000 people in
its plant.

Gettysburg College
considers disbanding
fraternity system

GETTYSBURC, Pa. (AP) -— Say-
ing the Greek system is an outdat-
ed bastion of exclusivity and
sexism, faculty members at
Gettysburg College are attempt-
ing to eliminate fraternities and
sororities on campus.

After haggling over the issue for
nearly four months, the faculty
voted 63-23 to ask President
Charles E. Glassick to present the
recommendation at the board of
trustees’ next meeting, May 13
and 14.

Last week, the faculty of Frank-
lin and Marshall College in Lan-
caster voted to disassociate itself
with fraternities and sororities.
Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, has done away with
Greek societies as has Amherst
College and Williams College in
Massachusetts.

If adopted at Gettysburg, the
proposal would affect more than
half of the students at this south-
central Pennsylvania college.
About 1,100 of Gettysburg’s
1,900 students belong to one of
the schools’s 12 fraternities or
seven sororities, according to B.J.
Davisson, assistant dean of stu-
dent life.

Kenneth Mott, a political
science professor who introduced
the motion approved by the
faculty earlier this month, said his
proposal had been brewing for
years. He said the impetus to call

for a ban this year came after an
incident last fall in which frater-
nity students became involved in
an ”alcohol abuse problem of
major proportions.” He declined
to give specifics.

Davisson said the general feel-
ing among many faculty mem-
bers is that Greek organizations
were outdated bastions of exclu-
sivity and sexism.

Exclusivity breeds narrow-
mindedness rather than a
broadening of the mind, and that,
Mott said, is directly opposed to
the college's stated mission. He
said fraternity and sorority
pledges were treated in a ”sort of
slave capacity,” and were forced
to run errands, prepare for parties
and do things upperclassmen did
not want to do. Some fraternities
also subtly promote a disrespect
of women through ”primitive
macho” behavior, he added.

”The Greek system is a huge
tradition," said Bill Kearney,
president of the school's
71-member Tau Kappa Epsilon
chapter. ”This place would be
lacking without fraternities and
sororities.”

"Most press we get is bad
press," Kearney said. ”You don't
see a lot of stories about fraterni-
ties and sororities and the chari-
ty work we do.”

Kearney said he thought the

Student Government

Board allocates funds
for Golf Club trip

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board last night-approved a re-
vised allocations request of
$1,368.56 for the Panther Golf
Club and denied a $7,569.90 re-
quest from the Waterski Club.

The Golf Club request, which
had been reviewed at the Board's
March 2 meeting, was reconsid-
ered at last night's meeting be-
cause of confusion over the
amount originally requested.

The Golf Club will use the
money to help fund a trip to
Seabrook Island, S.C. The
amount approved will cover half
the expected cost of transpor-
tation.

The Waterski Club's request for
$7,569.90 to rent a boat was de-

nied by the Board 4-5. The Board
was not scheduled to review the
Waterski Club's request but did
so in response to a question from
the floor.

Last night's meeting was held
in David Lawrence Hall as part of
an effort to include student con-
cerns on the SGB agenda. About
20 students attended.

In other business, Board mem-
ber Pamela Rich reported that
CAS students will be permitted to
register on the CGS’s book ex-
change program beginning Fri-
day, April 1.

Jackson reported that a writer
has contacted him concerning a
book about college life. Students
are requested to submit anec-
dotes to the Student Government
Office.

RICHMOND, Va. — President
Reagan said Monday that
Democratic candidates who es-
pouse trade restrictions and retali-
ation have a message the public
won't buy.

”Protectionism isn't just bad
economics — it's bad politics,”
the president said.

Reagan, in an address prepared
for delivery to workers at the Rey-
nolds Metals Co., issued a back-
handed slap at critics of his free-
trade philosophies. Although he
didn't name him, Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., made finding
new solutions to the nation's
trade woes a fixture of his
campaign.

’’I think the American people
have decided that one Great
Depression is enough, and they
aren't going to give the trade
demagogues a second chance,”
Reagan said.

”I would note that on Super
Tuesday, those who had predict-
ed that protectionism would be
embraced in the South were
proven wrong,” Reagan said.

The president attacked the in-
ternational trade bill under con-

sideration by a House-Senate
conference committee. The
House version contains a
Gephardt proposal requiring
presidential action against na-
tions running excess trade sur-
pluses.

”I’ll veto it if I must,” Reagan
warned.

He derided the bill's mandato-
ry retaliation and automatic pro-
tection provisions as ’’seriously
harmful to the national interest.
If enacted, they could weaken the
international trading system and
could require the president to
start trade wars.”

Officials investigate

new ’91 1’ complaints

PITTSBURGH — Public safety
officials are investigating the
latest round of complaints involv-
ing the city's 911 emergency
system.

Brian Butler, 20, of the city's
West End said he dialed 911
twice Saturday to say he'd found
his neighbor dead in her bathtub.
He said he got a recording each
time, so he asked a telephone
operator to try.

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED mass

The operator also got a record-
ing before a worker answered,
according to Butler.

Butler said he and his mother
often checked on the neighbor,
Delores Kosky, 61, because of
her poor health.

Wilma Bentley, 43, of the city's
Homewood section, said that she
also got a recording when she
called Friday night for help for
her 12-year-old son, Anthony,
who accidentally shot himself in
the head. Bentley said she hung
up and took her son to the hospi-
tal herself.

Deputy Public Safety Director
Louis DiNardo said department
officials can't respond to the com-
plaints until they're investigated.

”There are a number of issues
to put together. We certainly
can't jump to any conclusions,”
he said.

Public Safety Director Glenn
Cannon last month reprimanded
five police officers and three 911

Walsh-Israel reach

accord on ’lranscam’
WASHINGTON — Indepen-
dent Counsel Lawrence Walsh
has reached an agreement with
Israel after year-long negotiations
for its cooperation in his investi-
gation of the lran—Contra affair,
both sides announced Monday.
Under the accord, Israel has
given Walsh the historical and
financial chronologies covering
its role in the shipment of U.S.
weapons to Iran in 1985 and
1986, said an Israeli official.
”He [Walsh] will gei what he
wants without us having to give
up what we wanted,” said the
official, speaking on the condi-
tion that he not be named.
Israel had sought immunity
from prosecution for the four key
Israeli players in the arms sales,
profits from which were diverted
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

Pitt professor studies

By Mike Elko
Staff Writer

Dr. David Guzick, Pitt associ-
ate professor of obstetrics and gy-
necology, is performing a new
infertility procedure at Magee
Women's Hospital.

9 The procedure, zygote intra-

fallopian transfer, or ZIFT, com-
bines two previously established
techniques: in vitro fertilization,
commonly referred to as the test
tube procedure, and gamete
intra-fallopian transfer, or GIFT.

Guzick and Dr. Carolyn Kubik,
assistant professor of obstetrics
and gynecology at Pitt, are the
only physicians at the hospital
who perform ZIFT.

According to Cuzik, in ZIFT,
several eggs are recovered by
ultrasound from the ovaries. Fer-
tilization with sperm occurs in
vitro. The physician places the

‘artificial insemination

zygote in a catheter and transfers
it to the fallopian tubes.

While ZIFT offers new hope to
infertile couples, Guzick empha-
sized that the procedure only ap-
plies to a very small group of
people.

”Unfortunately, there's been
some news of this at the national
level in which certain figures get
reported and they are taken out
of context,” said Guzick. ”Cou-
ples come in and think that this
is going to be better than the
other [procedures] and this isn't
the case at all.”

The procedure, developed in
Australia and Irvine, Calif., is sug-
gested to couples who have not
achieved pregnancy with GIFT.

Physicians also propose it for
couples who cannot conceive
due to a low sperm count or se-
vere uterine scarring. Zift requires
that the woman have normal fal-
lopian tubes.

Phi Kaps win softball tourney

By Lisa Molinaro
Staff Writer

The weekend of March 19
was a proud one for the Pitt
brothers of Phi Kappa Theta
when they won first place in
the Phi Kappa Theta 5th Annu-
al Dixieland Classic softball
tournament.

The tournament was held at
the University of New Orleans
and was open to all chapters
of Phi Kappa Theta.

Most of the brothers of Pitt's
Phi Kappa Theta said they did
not expect to win the champi-
onship. ”We really just want-
ed to have a good time.
Winning was an added bo-
nus,” said Randy Riddle, sec-
ond baseman and catcher.

”We were the first team to
ever come from the north of
the Mississippi [sic] to play and
win,” he added.

This was the first year Pitt’s

chapter participated in the
tournament. ”We want to start
to raise the money in Septem-
ber so we can go down again
next year,” said Darin
Witherup, outfielder.

Pitt's chapter played the
University of New Orleans for
the championship and won
13-9.

”We rallied for four runs in
the last inning against the host
team to win the champion-
ship,” Riddle said. ’’It was a
battle of the top two and we
Came out on top.”

Riddle described the game
as a ”dramatic win.”

”New Orleans had four var-
sity baseball players on their
team, so it was really nice to
beat them,” he said.

Richard Shewman, pitcher,
third baseman and the team's
coach, was named the tourna-
ment’s Most Valuable Player.
Matt Stockman, outfielder,

Randy Riddle, and Fran Mon-
temurro, third base, short stop
and pitcher led the team's bat-
ting averages by batting over
.500.

The team also enjoyed visit-

ing the city of New Orleans.
”We drove 22 hours to get
there and it was worth it,” said
Riddle.
”New Orleans was a lot of fun
and everyone there treated us
well. Bourbon Street was a
huge hit.”

Dave Koromaus, another
team member, said, ”New
Orleans was a great time. We
had so much fun, plus we won
the tournament.”

The team received trophies,
a large Busch banner, shirts
and other assorted items for
winning first place.

The tournament is held ev-
ery year at the University of
New Orleans. It was spon-
sored this year by Busch Beer.

The Panthers’ Eric Cannon
turned in an NCAA qualifying
performance in the 110—meter
hurdles. He was clocked in at
13.6 while finishing second in
the event. Finishing fourth for Pitt
was Calvin Holmes (13.8).

Freshman Elbert Ellis narrowly
missed qualifying for the NCAA
Championships as he was timed
at 50.92 in the 400-meter inter-
mediate hurdles. However, Ellis
did qualify for the |C4A Champi-
onships as did fellow Panther
Chop Burton (53.76).

Pitt's Dave Price took third in
the 400-meter run. He ran a
47.59 in the process of qualifying
for the lC4A meet.

The Panther’s Mike Stratos
turned in a strong performance in
hurling the javelin 186--
feet-8-inches.

Aside from the strong individu-
al showings, four Pitt relay teams
distinguished themselves.

The 800-meter relay team of
Cannon, George lfill, Terry
Wellman and Neil Malbicky put
their names in the Pitt record
book as they were clocked in at
1:26.95.

The Panthers’ 6,000-meter
team finished eighth in the
process of setting a new school
mark. The team of Dave Moore,
Keith Dowling, Craig Woshner
and Tom Boggan completed the
assigned distance in 15:55.61.

Pitt's 1600-meter relay team of
Holmes, Ellis, Burton and Price
was timed in at 3:09.68 while
taking fourth.

Three freshmen ran the first

three legs of the 3200-meter re-

Rangers

The following column is a
prediction of the American
League West division.

Here's a surprise for you. The
Texas Rangers will meet their
promise of a year ago and win
this mediocre division.

Texas was considered a front
runner for last season's race but
had a terrible year and finished
last.

This season will be a little
different. Their young pitchers
have a year of maturity under
their belts, and their lineup is
stacked.

Knuckleballer Charlie Hough is
one of the most feared pitchers in
the AL. When Hough is on, no-
body can touch his dancer — not
even some catchers.

Jose Guzman was 14-14 last
year but finished the year with
eight straight wins. Bobby Witt

Wanke World

Sophomore quarterback Larry Wanke and the Panthers began spring workouts at
Pitt Stadium last Saturday in hopes of improving on last season's 8-4 record. Wanke
has received considerable practice time due to the knee injury to Darnell Dickerson.

Lady track
team has

big outing
at N. C. St.

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

With the initial meet of the out-
door season taking place last
Saturday, the Pitt women's track
program has come out of the
chute flying.

Led by a bumper crop of un-
derclassmen, the Lady Panthers
proved at the Atlantic Coast Track
Championships that they are a
team on the prowl.

Freshman Keisha Demas con-
tinued her series of strong perfor-
mances by capturing the
400-meter run in a time of 54.64.
Sophomore Ardythe Hope was
clocked in at 58.50 while taking
sixth in the event. Both Lady Pan-
ther’s times qualified them for the
Eastern Championships.

Clarissa Dudley, the other half
of Pitt's dynamic duo of high-
flying freshmen, ran a 15.04
while qualifying for Easterns in
the 100-meter hurdles. Dudley
did not rest on her laurels, as she
rocketed 5-feet-4-inches into the
air in taking sixth in the high
jump. .

The Lady Panthers’ Gloria
Azeke turned in a strong perfor-
mance in the 1500-meter run.
She finished fourth with a time of
4:41.70.

Debbie Fisher turned in a stel-
lar performance for the Pitt wom-
en as she hurled the javelin 128
feet, good enough for a sixth-
place finish.

Not to be outdone, several
Lady Panther relay teams served
notice that they will be forces to
be reckoned with.

The 800-meter relay team of
Dudley, Pat Cupid, sophomore
Vanessa Jones and Demas
finished second. Their time of
1:38.69 put them into the Pitt
record book.

Lady Panther freshman Sonia
Rivers, Cupid, Jones and Dudley

could be surprise team this season

(8-10) had the dubious distinction
of striking out a little over 11 bat-
ters per nine innings while only
giving up an average of seven
hits. Edwin Correa missed most
of the season last year with a
shoulder injury but is once again
healthy and should be ready for
opening day.

Cocky Pete lncaviglia (who hit
a ball through a centerfield fence
during spring training last year) is
one of the premier power hitters
in the league after only one full
year. Larry Parrish has been a
complainer but still hits in the
neighborhood of 30 homers a
yean

Then there is 20-year-old
Ruben Sierra. Last season, he was
the youngest player to knock in
100 runs and pound out 30 home
runs since Eddie Matthews in
1953.

VINCE
CAREY

To complement the power is
Pete O'Brien at first, Don Slaught
behind the plate and Scott Fletch-
er at shortstop. Then, of course,
there is the best name in baseball,
Oddibe McDowell.

The only thing that the Rangers
need is a quality reliever to be a
shoo-in for the crown. In this di-
vision, even that isn't needed.

A lot of people seem to be
picking the Oakland A's to win.
And that is the main reason why
they won't.

Sure, Mark McGwire was the
most exciting rookie last season,
and he will be one of the most ex-

citing sophomores this season,

but he can't carry the club.

The rest of the lineup is solid
enough. Jose Canseco strikes out
too much but can hit the long
ball. Dave Parker should thrive in
the AL, and Carney Lansford is
good for a few big hits.

The problem lies in the pitch-
ing. Dave Stewart had a career
year last season, and his ERA was
still over 4.00. Bob Welch could
be a big help if he pitches up to
his potential. Dennis Eckersley in
the bullpen should give the start-
ers some rest.

The thing is that the ERAS are
too big. To win games, the A's
will have to score 10 runs a game
because their pitchers could very
well give up nine. Nobody can
win a division like that.

The Minnesota Twins (made
the miracle run to the title last
season. It will take a lot more for

them to win it this season.

The Twins only had one major
player go on the disabled list all
season: first baseman Kent Hrbek.
Teams don't usually stay healthy
for two straight seasons.

Another problem will be their
pitching. Other than World Ser-
ies MVP Frank Viola and Bert
Blyleven, the Twins are hurting.
Les, Straker looked tough in the
series but during the regular sea-
son he was hit hard. . '

The bullpen has fire-balling Jeff
Reardon to rely; on. After that,

V there's nothing.

Minnesota's lineup has _‘be-
come a legend. Dan Gladden,
Kirby Puckett, Tom Burnansky
and Hrbek are a fearless bunch
who can almost score runs at
will.

When the Twins get rolling,

their offensive punch can destroy
other teams. If they can hang
tough until September, you never
know.

The rest of this division could
go any way. Any of the teams
could finish in fourth or seventh;
it just depends on how things
shape up.

The Seattle Mariners should

improve this season.

last season, the Mariners
finished in fourth with a 78-84
record, yet they were only seven
games out of first.

This winter, Seattle picked up
the National League's best defen-
sive right fielder, Glenn Wilson,
for Phil Bradley. Wilson has al-
ways liked the high fastball, and
he should see plenty of those in

The Mariners are still strong in
other departments. Alvin Davis is
turning into one of the most ( on-
sistent first basemen in the
league.

The reason that more people
don't pick Seattle is because
some of their best players are vir-
tually unknown to the casual fan.

All-Star second baseman
Harold Reynolds led the AL in
stolen bases (60) last season.
Mickey Brantley hit .302, and
shortstop Rey Quinones knocked
in 56 runs during 1987.

To top it all off, Seattle has the
best pitcher in the AL. Last sea-
son, Mark Langston had 19 wins
and led the league in strikeouts
with 262. The thing is that he
does this every year, and it goes
unnoticed.

The Mariners are a good team.

manager Dick Williams, Seattle
could surprise some people.

What ever happened to the
Kansas City Royals?

Sure, they have a ha|f~decent
team, but they can't win.

Third baseman Kevin Seitzer
had the kind of year last year that
would have won him the rookie
of the year award in any other
year. All Seltzer did was hit at a
.323 clip, with 15 round-trippers
and 83 RBIs.

The problem with this team is
that they finished second last year
on the memory of the late Dick
Howser.

This motivated career years for
Danny Tartabull and pitcher
Floyd Bannister, which they will
be hard pressed to repeat.

Manager John Wathan also has
outfielder Bo Jackson to worry
about.

lackson is the best athlete on

the Royals and should be a start- I

er. If the Royals bench him, it will
only mean trouble. Too much
trouble for the Royals.

The California Angels and the
Chicago White Sox are both im-
proving but are at least a year
away to be talked about in terms
of contenders.

For Pitt coach John Vasvary, the
opening meet of the outdoor sea~

”lt was a real good meet for us.
With over 100 schools from the

The t2()()~meter relay team of
Hannah Russell, sophomore

best of two worlds. Not only did
they set a Pitt record in the event,
but they also qualified for

Pitt coach Steve Lewis was en-
