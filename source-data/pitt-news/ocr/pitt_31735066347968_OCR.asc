Knox Dismisses Johnson Charges

" In Five-year Discrimination Case

By BETSY NORMAN

U.S. District Court Judge
William Knox dismissed all charges
of sex discrimination ﬁled against
the University by assistant bio-
chemistry professor Sharon John-
son in a 92-page decision ﬁled
yesterday morning.

In his judgment order, Knox
stated, “It is. ordered that the
complaint (of sex discrimination)
ﬁled by the plaintiff (Johnson) in
this case be dismissed as to all
defendants (Pitt, Chancellor Pos-
var, ex-medical school Dean Donald
Medearis, ex-biochemistry chair-
man Edward Heath, ex-Vice
Chancellor for the Health Related
Professions, Francis S. Cheever and
certain members of the Board of
Trustees). It is further ordered that

L ﬁnal judgment be entered in favor

of the defendants and against the
plaintiff.”

Johnson ﬁled charges of sex
discrimination as a result of her
1971 tenure denial and sought
tenure, backpay and $1.5 million in
damages.

In a statement released yesterday
Pitt officials said, “The University
is pleased that the court has
completely exonerated it of all
charges of sexual discrimination in
the Johnson case. It is most
signiﬁcant that the court upheld the
principle of peer review in the
academic disciplines and found
Pitt’s practices and procedures in
the tenure review process were
proper.”

Nurses File
Sex Charge
Against Pitt

The American Nurses’ Associa-
tion (ANA) recently ﬁled a sex
discrimination charge against Pitt
with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, alleging
the University pays female faculty
substantially lower salaries than
their male colleagues.

The charge contended the
alleged discrimination is a violation
of the Title VII provision of the
amended 1964 U.S. Civil Rights
Act. _

The ANA grievance was de-
livered on behalf of several of its
members employed at Pitt, accord-
ing to a press release, which did

not disclose the individuals’
names.
Pitt Director of News and

Publications Mary Ann Aug said
the University’s legal department
has not received notiﬁcation of the

ANA charge.

The Pitt News is suspemullﬂ
publication until 591”? 7' Eh" '

Johnson and her lawyer, Sylvia
Roberts, declined comment on the
case and refused to say whether
they would appeal the decision. In
the past, Johnson said she would
take the suit to the U.S. Supreme
Court if necessary.

Flo Scardina, co-president of the
first Pittsburgh chapter of the
National Organization for Women
(NOW), said yesterday that NOW
expected this decision. -

“It is this kind of decision _we
have unfortunately come to expect
from the U. S. judicial system today.
We wish it were not so, but this
ruling follows Supreme Court
decisions prohibiting abortions for
poor women and disability compen-
sation for pregnant women. These

‘decisions show women in this

country are not receiving justice,
particularly in the federal courts,”
she said. '

NOW has paid a large portion of
Johnson's expenses incurred dur-
ing the trial.

Knox’s decision dissolved the
preliminary court injunction that
forced Pitt to keep Johnson on the
faculty at Pitt rests with the School

of/Medicine.

“It is now up to our department
and the School of Medicine to
decide if her contract will be
renewed or not,” Dr. Robert
Basford, acting chairman of the
biochemistry department said. “It
is back in our laps.”

The decision of a contract renewal
is expected within a week.

Ellen Doyle, executive director of
the American Civil Liberties
Union’s local chapter, interpreted
the judge’s decision.

“The judge has, in effect, said
that ample justiﬁcation of denial of
tenure has been shown. Johnson
did present a prima facie case of sex

discrimination, and the University
came back with a defense which
proved their justiﬁcation by a
preponderance of the evidence in
the case. But Johnson did not prove
that the reasons for the tenure were
pretextual.

‘ ‘Mostof this decision is based on
ﬁnding of fact. A decision based on
ﬁnding of fact usually rests with the
lower courts. An appeals court will
usually uphold a ruling based on
ﬁnding of fact,” Doyle said.

The question of responsibility for
legal fees remains. Pitt can ﬁle suit
asking the court to require Johnson
to cover Pitt’s legal expenses, which
Posvar said amount to some
$300,000. However, the U.S.
Supreme Court will not determine
whether under Title VII, a plaintiff
can be forced to pay a defendant's
legal expenses until the court
reconvenes in November.

_ Sharon Johnson, assistant protessofoi biochemistry yesterday had charges of

sex discrimination at Pitt dismissed by a federal judge. Johnson had sought
tenure and monetary damages; yesterday's decision means Pitt can fire her.

Woman Sues Pitt, Policeman

By ANGELE ELLIS

Pitt and a former campus
policeman have been sued for false
arrest, assault, slander and libel in
connection with an alleged assault
on a Penn Hills woman in 1973, the
Pittsburgh’ Press reported Sunday.

A Pitt department of legal
services spokesman said yesterday
the University has not received
notiﬁcation of the Thompson suit.

The woman, Emma Thompson,
is seeking more than $10,000 in
damages from Pitt and former
policeman Edward Foster on each
of the three counts contained in her
Common Pleas Court lawsuit.

The suit charged that Foster,
who was in uniform and operating a
campus police van, attempted to

open Thompson’s car door while
she was stopped at a red light ‘on
Fifth Avenue near Tennyson Street
about 8 p.m. on December 10,
1973.

When Thompson asked him to
identify himself and explain his
action, the suit said, Foster
allegedly used’ profanity, rocked
the car, reached inside and
violently pulled her from the
vehicle. - ‘

Thompson freed herself, got
back in her car and drove away as
Foster followed in the van. She
stopped for help when she saw a
city police van, the suit contended.

The city police, instead of
helping Thompson, forced her to
turn her" car over to a city police
ofﬁcer. The officer drove her to the

No. 4 police station ‘at Louisa and
Semple Streets, where she was
ﬁngerprinted and photographed‘
against her will and charged by
Fosteriwith assault and resisting
arrest, Thompson said in the suit.

Foster, who allegedly made the
charges against Thompson in order
to protect himself, then offered to
drop them ‘and cite_ her for a trafﬁc
violation if she would forget the.

incident, the suit said. Thompson » -

refused.‘ ,

Although Foster lost his job after
Thompson ﬁled a criminal charge
against him and acity magistrate
dismissed all charges against
Thompson eight days after the
incident, she said the incident has
damaged her reputation.

Both BayardSides Seekingsolution

‘ By cmsropann c. HOEL

Interfratemity Council (IFC)
leaders are pushing for a more
speciﬁc Greek 'code of conduct in an
effort to solve neighbor problems
centered around Bayard Street,
while that neighborhood’s citizens
are contributing to a legal fund and
having . preliminary court papers
prepared.

The fraternities are gearing for a
court battle. sure to come if the
proposed behavior code isn’t
effective by informally contacting
several alumni attorneys, including
Delta Tau Delta's William Kunst-
ler, defender in several heavily
publicized trials of the past decade.

But IFC president John Powers
said last night he hoped the conduct
code, which has been developing
since December, would deﬁne a
workable system of behavior limits
and redress procedures that could
please both sides of the long
dispute.

. Avril‘-""i"(’w‘r-""" V‘ *

WILLIAM KUNSTLER

“We are concerned about their
°(the neighbors’) problems,” Pow-
ers said. “We are trying to make
Sure. through a system in which
student leaders are contacted ﬁrst

in the event of}

1

complaint, that

neighbors don’t have to be worried
about behavior.

“Our belief,” he added, “is that
Greek behavior should be the same
as that expected from any
neighbor.”

Powers said that in the past
Greeks concerned with behavioral
excesses “had their hands tied” by
a code of conduct that was vague
and “did not lend itself to holding
an individual accountable for his
actions.

“I believe these complaints
should be dealt with if they are
justiﬁed,” Powers said. “This
system could enable us to do that.
It’s the ﬁrst in the nation, so far as ‘I
know.” \

Bayard residents have com-
plained for years about fraternity
behavior, alleging misdoings from
harrassment and disorderly conduct
to public urination and improper
sunbathing.

“Some of those complaints are
unjustiﬁ ,” said Powers, “but

those that are correct will be taken
care of, if possible, by us. The only
thing we won’t negotiate is the
immediate removal of houses from
the area, which is what some
neighbors on Bayard seem to want.

“But anything else will be
discussed, if they wish to communi-
cate their concerns to us. We have a
right to be there, but a responsi-
bility to be good members of the
community. ’.’

Meanwhile, however, neighbors
are continuing to explore legal
channels. A reliable source
reported each involved Bayard
resident has been asked to
contribute $200 to a legal fund, with
proceeds being used for preparation
of preliminary papers.

A reliable source close to the
Bayard situation said Delta Tau
Delta has contacted Kunstler but
that it. has not been determined
whether he would represent the
individual chapter or the entire IFC

should he enter the case. i -

Jackie Sherrill’s decision will not be made
before next week, but it appears certainAl Chesley
will play football for Pitt this season.

Sherrill had said Chesley, arrested June 7 in

0 Tower C on drug-related charges, would play only

if a campus judicial board ruled the 19-year-old
linebacker should be reinstated. Sherrill suspen-
ded Chesley from the squad after the arrest.

Campus judicial coordinator Al Bowen said last
night Chesley’s case was decided July 18, but that
the Buckley privacy law barred release of the out-
come. Bowen, an attorney, also said Chesley had
not requested a closed hearing but that “no one
else was there.”

“I can tell you this much,” Bowen said, “Mr.
Chesley is eligible to play football this year, at
least so far as the judicial board’s authority goes...”

A spokesman from Pitt’s sports information of-
fice said last night Sherrill would make the
decision as early as next week, and would consult
athletic director Cas Myslinski and Chancellor
Posvar before announcing his plans for Chesley.

Published reports indicating Sherrill would an-
nounce a decision this week are “not accurate,”
according to the Pitt spokesman. -

Neither Chesley nor the complainant, a campus
police officer, could be reached foL comment last
night. Chesley was cleared of all but one city
count against him by magistrate John Troiano last
month. -

Sherrill will have to make his decision known
before August 21, when Pitt will head for West
Liberty College (seven minutes from Wheeling)
and a 10-day fall camp...

    

   

Cleveland Edwards-?_ has been promoted by Pitt
basketball coach ”I‘-,irnf,Grgurich, who has selected
Edwards to replace former assistant coach Bob
Hill. That may di'spr;ove the belief of some that
Edwards and graduate assistant Sam Fleming
(both of whom were[Panthers a few seasons ago)

Were bmught in 0l11)i~ to ensure that Pitt landed
Sam Clancy, since-_ ..all three played for Fifth
Avenue High Schojol’; Or it could be Grgurich’s
way of rewarding-'E_dwards for a recruiting job
well done. Either-way, Edwards, an easygoing
good choice... 5, ,-

Word from Tarripa§Bay is that Cecil Johnson, a
free agent at the  camp, has a good chance of
making the Natiorialj-3 Football League team. It
appears that _Cecil’_s bad knees, rumored by team-
mates to be mainly:-afproduct of J ohnson’s dislike
of practice, have disappeared in the face of a con-
tract and a bonus.

his competition there is formidable; Don Parrish,
after an early-summer car accident, was given a
“realistic chance” of making the Falcons, an

enjoying the "thin. air in Denver, punting happily
after signing a series of contracts; Al Ro‘mano is
finding the switch to linebacker is not easy in
Houston; Larry Felton is with the Baltimore
Colts; and Tony Dorsett, when not in court or ex-
plaining his misadventures to Tom Landry, is
prepping for what could be a phenomenal rookie
year with Dallas. Dorsett threw a pass good for
more than 60 yards in a recent scrimmage...

Finally, some pre-camp projections: Leverga
Walker, if he remains healthy, will play a great
deal and could start...if he doesn’t, one of the
many younger runners will...Gordon Jones and
Tom Brzoza will rival Matt Cavanaugh in the
publicity department...Jackie Sherrill’s kicking
situation, unless a minor miracle emerges from the
woodwork, could resemble Johnstown...Pitt will
employ an offensive strategy much like that of the
Cowboys, with pro sets and the shotgun, both
suited to Cavanaugh and his quick
receivers...Kurt Brechbill will start...Bob
Haygood will not come back to play behind
Cavanaugh. If he returns, he’ll try to play
somewhere else. He has ‘played running back and
could play defensive back if Jeff Delaney were to
fill one of the holes at linebacker.
