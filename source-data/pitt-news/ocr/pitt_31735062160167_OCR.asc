Political Clubs Active,

By JACK MARKOWITZ

But Not Yet Approved   A

v Whether Penn‘ State’s recent approval of two campus political organizations will af-
fect the Pitt administration’s stand on student political groups was still a matter of con-‘
jecture today. Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle, chairman of _the committee on student or-
ganizations, said that the committee probably will not meet to decide on sanctioning
political clubs here until after the Easter recess. '

Main reason in the past for Pitt’s refusal to sanction politics on campus was that
the state legislature, which appropriates much of the school’s income, might suspect that
the University favored a particular party. However, both a Democratic and a Republican
student party were approved last week at Penn State, which is also dependent on the

legislature for funds. University recognition of a group would give it the right to hold, V

But the group is not yet ready tee

the November presidential elec-
tion, according to the head of the
Young Democrats, College sopho-

Part of the group’s uncertainty
is due to the fact that President»
Harry S. Truman has not yet de-
clared his intention either to run
for re-election or not.

But the student Democrats are,
Reese says, planning to encourage
students to vote on election day
and to discuss national and inter-
national political issues on cam-
pus.

At present, the group's advisor
is Lewis W. Rathgeber, lecturer in
history, and president of the
Pennsylvania Young Democrats.

Reese believes the University
will grant recognition to the Dem-
ocratstand other student political
groups, “in view of the recent ac-
tion taken by other state-support-
eds universities, including Penn
State, in approving politics on
campus.”

Though nowicornposed of only
a few more than 20 students,
Reese says that the Young Demo-

Pittites are interested in joining
the group, both men and women.

Increased Cost

T 0 Cut Editions

Like many of its counter-
" p a r ts in the publications
world, The Pitt News this
week found itself caught in
the spiral ’of increasing pro-
duction costs and a decline in
net income. ‘Unlike its coun-
terparts, The News is ‘unable
to offset these factors by rais-
ing its circulation price.

In order to ward off an im-
pending deﬁcit, The News,de-
eided to reduce the total num-
ber of editions. The ﬁrst
move in this policy will result
in the elimination of this Fri-

..day’s edition.. Other cuts will
be made between then and the
end of the school year.‘ ’

The next issue of The News
will appear on, Tuesday, Apr.
1, when a special edition [ap-
pears to mark April Fools Day.
Thereafter, The News will ap-
pear as scheduled. Advertis-

‘Gentlemen’ Over-rated;

Channing Aids Musical

. By DICK SNYDER
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the musical comedy which
knocked New Yorkers out of their seats for two years, ar-

rived Monday evening.

Something evidently was lostlin transit. The Nixon is

currently over—charging for the¢

most over—rated musical in years.

For besides a large and fairly
diverting lady comic named Carol
Channing, Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes has precious little to rec-
ommend it. Producers Herman Le-
-vin and Oliver Smith have taken
a tired book, added minor league
music and second—rate dancing,

Not much of an evening, however.
Channing Saves Show

“ Were it not for Miss Channing

and John C. Wi1son’s trip-hammer
pacing, ‘Gentlemen’ could be writ-
ten oﬁ as a total loss. Wilson has
given the show a swift workout

  ~SC Puts Off Action

On Move To Favor

Campus Politics

[Ross Reese, sophomore in the College, asked Student
Congress Monday afternoon “to go on record as being strong-
ly in favor of student political organizations.”

The solons took ‘no ﬁnal actionon the question. They

also tabled ‘a motion opposing theﬂ
‘ groups.

Reese's proposal came after
Men’s Council had unanimously
endorsed the clubs. Reese pointed
out that Penn. State and Penn,
both state-supported schools, had’

4alread‘y‘—recognized similar student

groups.
Keep _Out of Mud

Jim Rock led the opposition to
Congress backing the groups. Rock
said the schoolshould jbe.“spared
from two-bit_ political rabble-rous-
ers” and labeled the proposal “a
thing.” Rock said we
‘‘‘shouldn’t be dragged into the

T mud.”

Reese ‘replied that now was the
timeifor students to learn the re-

-sponsibilities they must’. face in

later life. I‘ ,

Rock then moved that Congress
‘oppose the political clubs. Presi-
dent Cyril Wecht "ruled the mo-
tion out of order, saying that “you
Can’t make a motion against

something that doesn’t exist,”,. and
urged thatiCo-ngresstake no stand
until after the ‘Committee deciding
the recognition of the clubs met.
7Weoht Overruled
_Rock appealed the. decision of

the chair, and Wecht was overrul-

ed. Then Jack Burwinkle moved
that Congress table the motion.
Burwinkle’s motion carried han-
dily. '1

Congress. also discussed four
proposed changes in their by-
laws. '

These were: (1) that the four
faculty advisors work with the
four "standing committees; (2) that
threeunexcused absences be cause
for expulsion ‘of members; (3) that
the necessary quality point avarege
be raised from one pointto 1:2

should have power to -appoint

By ED MURPHY

Spring has

fessor of South American history is

iAt 10 o’clock, the high-pitched

shrill of a siren abruptly sounds,
alerting the students and teacher.
It is the yellow alert signal, warn-
ing of an impending air raid. In
exactly 24 minutes the Cathedral
and its occupants will be undergo-
- ing an air bombardment.

That siren may never scream,

but if it..,does, Pitt is ready.

Speciﬁc procedure has been es-

tablished for every room in the

Cathedral for an orderly move-

ment of thepeople to the shelter

area. There are posters ready for
every room, with a diagram show-
ing the direct route to be taken to
get to the shelter on that ﬂoor.

‘Shelter areas are as close to the
center of the building and as far
away from the windows as possi-
ble.

In the case of the. ground ﬂoor
the shelter area is the corridor
running alongside the‘ Red Tuck

Adams, Civil Defense director.
Students will line up in double

while the instructor consults the
poster displayed in the room to
ﬁnd out the prescribed route. The
students then ﬁle out of room to
the shelter area, directed by war-
dens appointed for each ﬂoor.
“Since the yellow alert signal will
be sounded 24 minutes before the
raid actually begins there is no
need for haste. Pitt is completely
ready in the event of an air raid,~
even if we were attacked tomor-
row,” said Viers Adams. ‘

  Greek Week

On Monday Pitt’s fraternity men and sorority women_
begin observing the ﬁrst Greek Week in the University’s
history. During that’ week the accent will be on the merits A
anddemerits of the Greeks as a campus institution rather
than on those of a particular fraternity or sorority.

_ Until sometime near the start of the ﬁrst World War
the Greeks enjoyed an almost unassailable position in ithe
life of the average American university. They were high-
ly organized reservoirs of leadership in all phases of col-
legiate life, academic as well as social and political. It was

‘virtually impossible for the student to become a complete

success without ﬁrst joining a Greek letter society. Many of
the .most prominent leaders in American life today owed
allegiance at one time to one of these societies.
. But during the Twenties a variety of groups began tak-
ing potshots at the Greeks and seriously questioning their
role in the nation’s educational system. These attacks have
continued with varying degrees of intensity and seriousness
since then. ‘ , C —
The Greeks have been sitting ducks for their detractors.
They have been charged with perpetuating and ‘organizing
group and individual snobbery; they have been held inimi-
cal to our American concepts of equality and brotherhood;
they have been indicted as havens for the second-rate, as
emotional opponents to change, as unimaginati-ve support-
ers of the status quo and ﬁnally as institutionally juvenile

in their approach to living.
‘ * it * * =l¢ =5

“In their defense the Greeks have offered the unquestion-

ed services theyprovide the student. They answer a need

for organized and varied social life and they satisfy an

urge of the student for a group with which he can identify

himself. They provide the student with a base from which "

he can enter the competitive world of the universities and
they give him a feeling of uniqueness, a feeling which all

A of us feel compelled to satisfy in our various Ways.

The Greeks argue that they are merely an extension of
the organized social and fraternal groups which abound in
our society; that they actually perpetuate the more endur-
ing qualities of mankind; i.e. service,‘ loyalty, ’conviviality

— and Congeniality, and that it is natural for men of similar
* tastes to band together.

The universities and colleges have naturally looked with
favor on the Greek societies. Their highly ﬁnished organi-
zation makes them the ideal channels through which stu-

. dent enthusiasms and interests can be channeled. In most I

schools they are the basis of all student life, regardless of
their numbers.
. * * * 91% >34 =1:

The Greek problem, therefore, is something the Greeks
must themselves solve. During this week they should de-
vote much of their energies to some searching introspec-

. tion and re-evaluation. If they are to remain inﬂuential

as well as respected in the university world, their success
Will be determined by the honesty they display in approach-
ing their problems.

At Pitt the fraternities almost completely monopolize
the activities life. Even the most casual observer is aware
that much of the politics in this area is more than just
questionable. The blame for this must be laid onthe Greek’s
doorstep.

Some of the most inﬂuential and highly regarded men
in the frat world here have been guilty of some of the pet-
tiest of political acts. Their association with the Greeks
must be a source of justiﬁed embarrassment. For how else

are the non—Greeks to judge them other than by their ac-

tions? 
We hope that they willhonestly examine themselves
next week. The program should not degenerate into a mu-

..\ Aggression Is No Answer

Preventive- war———a subject turned over from
time to time in student conversations—got a dan-
gerous and short—sighted treatment last week in
Life Magazine’s lead editorial.

While the most discouraging aspect of Russia’s
relations with the United States has been the
Soviet’s feeling that a Communist Russia could not
exist alongside a Capitalistic
United States, itgis more discour-
aging to learn from Life virtu-
ally that the United States cannot
exist alongside Russia.

The distinction may seem
academic—-but the point is
whether we, too, have begun to
feel that war must be inevitable,
as well as the Russians.

Here are the major points in ,,
Life’s editorial, Coexistence With Russia:

“Our terms for co—existence are simple, but very
ﬂat: The Communist imperialism. and totalitarian-
ism of the Stalin regime are intolerable. They must
be replaced andltheir sign and, seal, the Iron Cur-
tain, removed.

“The U. S. minimum requirements of Russia are
irreducible and mandatory: liberation.

“Our problem is-to achieve this with the ‘least

, risk of hot war. The political was is unlimited and

for keeps.”
A War Policy?

What Life’s editors fail to see is that the libera-
tion of ‘the Russian people from the Communist
dictatorship cannot be accomplished without a. hot
war.

Thus, though the editorial does not advocate
the starting of a war against Russia, the U. S.
“mandatory” requirement of liberation would lead
inevitably to an aggressive war on our part.

Further, Life is completely wrong in asserting
that America’s task is liberation. America’s task.
is the preservation of peace. Much as Americans

Avicition uel Programs Ollers Special Opportunities

   
   
   

JACK MARKOWI12

must sympathize with a people that must livo
under a totalitarian regime, their liberation would
not be worth the jeopardizing of peace.

The Propaganda Effect '

But the most important and most dangerous ef-
fect of such an editorial in America’s biggest maga-
zine is the effect that it must have on peoples 
other countries—-allies and enemies.

While American readers know, at least, that
the Ul S. is not the aggressor in the world, it is
likely that a reader in India, Germany, or even’
France and Britain, might have some doubts of
the peaceful tendencies of the United States, when
he reads the sudden doctrineof “liberation.”

Even the very people in Russia that we would
be trying to liberate would be told from above
that this was only another case of American “im-
perialism.” With all our good intentions, we would
be seen in the wrong in every corner of the world.
American liberation would not be Welcomed.

Even American citizens themselves would have
some doubt of the holiness of our intentions, a sus-
picion that perhaps there are powerful interests in
the United States that want war.

Official American foreign policy today is much
saner. We are a defender in Korea, and ourgtask
is that of protecting areas of freedom throughout
the world. We will be in the right just so long as
we are a defender andnot an aggressor. ~

. . By JACK DAVEY

Phi Gamma Delta made it two
in a row Friday night in the Field‘
House when they were again
, crowned champions of the Frater-
nity Basketball League for the
second straight year.

The Fiji’s edged the PiKA
dribblers, 50-47, as a part of
Sports Carnival Night.

‘ Dillon High Scorer

Glenn Dillon was the primary
reason for the Fiji victory by vir-
tue of his 20-point scoring effort.
In the ﬁrst half he contributed ex-
- actly half of his team’s scoring to-
tal of 24 points by connecting for
six ﬁeld goals.

.0 PiKA had orily three men who
could ﬁnd the hoop in the ﬁrst half
and as a result were on the short
end of a 24-20 halftime score.

Don Milletary began to hit for
PiKA in the second half and gave
them a 38-36 lead in the fourth
quarter which they were unable
to hold and the Fiji’s emerged vic-
torious, 50-47.

Combined Stars Win

The Combined Stars overcame a
ten point deﬁcit Friday night to

, come from behind and wallop the
Fraternity Stars in the Field
House, 36-27.

‘Ed Dzubak, a product of Home-
stead High School, was the out-
standing player. of the game as a

points. A

Author Hits Realism

In Writing at Confalo

Mrs. Agnes Sligh Turnbull, who spoke last week at the
WSGA Vocational Guidance Conference, told her audience
more than her subject, “Writing as a Career,” implied.

The charming Mrs. Turnbpll gave her conception of the

ROTC Grads

Start Service

An estimated 5,000 graduates in
the Air Force ROTC, 66 of whom
are expected to come from Pitt,
will be ordered into active mili-
tary service within 120 days after
spring graduation, Air Force of-
ficials announced today.

Air Force second lieutenants or-
dered to active ' military service
will be given opportunity to vol-

unteer for ﬂying training and for -

training in civilian institutions in
the ﬁelds of meteorology, lan-
guages, and the physical sciences.

Assignment of the new ofﬁcers
will be made on the basis oiled-
ucational qualiﬁcations and Air
Force requirements. In most cases
students will be advised of their
assignments prior to their gradua-
tion.

Delays in reporting 1 will be

accepted, for graduate study in
certain technical ﬁelds needed by
the Air Force.

M owrey To Speak L

Dr. Corma A. Mowrey, director
of the Division of_ Professional
Services of the West Virginia Edu-

“The School Board and Teacher
Organizations” at the meeting of
the Universityof Pittsburgh
School Board Institute, tomorrow
night at 8 p.m. in 324 C1.

This address will be the fourth
in the series of eight meetings on
public education sponsored an-
nually by the Tri-State Area
School Study Council and the

‘purpose of writing: “My conten-

tion is that the business of the
novelist is to show life whole-
not one sordid side of it.”

In refuting what she termed
the “trend in the English-speaking
world toward ultra-realism,” Mrs.
Turnbull insisted that the writer
must “admit the existence of the
intangible, t h e imponderables
which are far more important than
the others. They represent the
dream of mankind.”

Other aspects of her short. talk
‘included answers she would make
.to questions. asked by young writ-
ers about plots, marketing of short
stories, and “inspiration” in writ-
ing. Mrs. Turnbull then contrast-
ed the technique in the writing of
the short story and the noveL

Mrs. Turnbull is the ‘author of

Graduation

Freshman women will graduate
this week from their guilds.

With “Graduation from the
Guild Program” as their theme,
the gals will celebrate at a party
on Friday, Mar. 28, from 3:30 un-
til 5 p.m. in 1217 C1.

Instead of a fair. which the
guilds held last year, the freshmen
are pooling their talents to hold
this party as a climax to this se-
mester’s activities.

The guilds in charge of enter-

» tainment are planning a game

called “Paper Bag DramatiCs.” The
girls will be divided into groups
and given skits to act out.

To highlight the afternoon, the
food committee will serve mer-
ingue shells filled with ice cream
and covered with different ﬂavored
sauces which the girls will pre-
pare themselves.

his lightweight English Ralleigh,

George Cohen gets to school on

on Fifth Avenue, is an organization

Cyclers Don’t Fear
High Cost of Travel

By JOAN THOMAS
Three members of the American Youth Hostels are beat-
ing high streetcar fares by cycling to Pitt every morning.
Fred Freuthal, George Cohen and Jack Stein declare

that besides avoiding the discomforts of stuffy
..._._...._....._._.....__._......._......_--...

streetcars,
left the group to cycle to Maine.
The council sponsors a trip
every week, regardless of weather.
The three recalled they had their
largest turnout last April Fool’s

Day when there was a steady
downpour all day. “They came

‘just for the fun of it,” they said.

The group, which also sponsors
hiking and trail blazing, has driven
in cars to West Virginia and hiked
in Cooper’s Rock State Forest to
explore the huge caves. They
make frequent weekend trips to
Du1aney’s Cave and McConnell’s
Mills, both in Pennsylvania.
