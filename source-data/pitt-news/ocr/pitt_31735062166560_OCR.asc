The Office of Admissions
disclosed some statistics of
the geographical student ra-
tio. “Of the 2,070 freshman,”
said Bernard J. Kobosky, di-
rector of admissions, 92 per
cent are Pennsylvania students

‘ and eight per cent are students

from out of state.”

Regarding in-state freshmen,
“5,644 applied and we accepted
3,021, or approximately 56 per
cent. Almost 63 per cent of the

accepted applicants entered the
University.

“We received about the same
number of applicants from out
of state as last year. Of the 1,091
applican-ts, we accepted approxi-
mately 57 per cent, or 628. Of
that number, 29 per cent chose
to enter the University. The us-
ual percentage is 50 per cent.”

Kobosky emphasized that “we
do want to maintain a higher
ratio of in-state and out-of-state
students.” He cited 75 per cent
in-state to 25 per cent out-of-
state as “realistic” ratio. He des-

British Oppose Vietnam War

“I think the War in Viet-

World War Three, “stated
Stanley Orme, British Labour
Party member of Parliament,
Orme, and his colleague Frank
Allaun, are two, of a, party of
six -British’MP‘s who have ‘came
to the United States —to meet
with American congressmen and
senators to inform them, of wide-
spread British opposition ‘to the
war in Southeast Asia.

Speaking at the ‘Thursday Af-
ternoon on the Porch Program
of the Western Pennsylvania
Academic Council on Problems
of War and Peace, Orme and
Allaurn also addressed members
of the community at the home
of James Holland, associate pro-
fessor of psychology at the Uni-
versity.

Allaun, who is deputy chair-
man of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee of the Labour Parliamen-
tary Party, feels that the main
reason Brit-ain’s Prime Minister
Harold Wilson has refused to
condemn United States aggres-
sion in Vietnam is dollars.
“When Wilson came into office
on November 23, 1964, he in-
herited a failing economy. The

  Honoraries to Participate

This year the annual Activ-
ities Fair sponsored by AWS
and Men's Council will be held
in the SU Ballroom on Sept. 19.
But it will be different from pre-
vious Fair’s because it will have
the theme of a carnival. All th-e
participating organizations will
build carnival booths, from which
they will recruit new members.
In’ keeping with the carnival
theme, Saga Food will sell pop,

men who have not previously
registered for rush will be able
to do so. For the ﬁrst time, hon-
orary societies will also have

to inform the University com-

said Allaun.
“But,” he continued, “India,

ter Nehru and his successor Mrs.
Gandhi have shown courage and

States position in Vietnam.”
The two MPs showed that op-
position to t-he war among Bri-
tish citizens is more widespread
than the government makes pub-
lic. British Gallup poll ﬁgures
show that 45 per cent of t-hose
polled in Great Britain believe
America should withdraw from
Southeast Asia, while‘ only 15
per cent think the war should
be escalated. Fifteen per cent
believe that the present US posi-
tion should be maintained, while
the remainder don’t have an
opinion.
i “In fact,” said All-aun, “in
Harold Wilson’s own constituen-
cy in Liverpool, 87 per cent of
the ﬁrst 4,400 polled to date be-

Committee Orients Freshmen

The goal of the Secondary
School Committee is to help ori-

University. After acceptance,
these freshmen receive, letters
from members " of the commit-

to help the out-of-state ratio and _

to increase the quality of the in-
state student. The committee is
planning informal meetings with
freshmen to'acquaint them with

tifated A this program last year‘

ported and brought to the at-
tention of the public “We’ve en-
countered chauvinism, jingoism,
and false patriotism, and we
know what you have to contend
with,” he said.

“You realize that any death,
- especially th'at'of one close to

you, is a very tragic thing,” said
Orme, “but the,war in Vietnam
is serving-to make war seem, a
more ‘ feasible solution to world
problems. For this reason,” he
continued, “other armed con-
ﬂicts such, as the Arab-Israeli
war seem less important and we
foolishly tend to ignore their
dangerous potenrtial.”

Both men believe that the real
danger is that China, Will enter
the conﬂict and bring with it
the Russians. “Imagine that the
shoe was on the other foot,”
stated Allaun, “and 500,000 Chi-
nese troops were ﬁghting in
Mexico and Chinese planes were
being shot down on the Texas
border. Do you think the United

“So far the world has been

destroyed,” said Orme. ,

“Einstein said ‘Anti-Comm-un-

Advisory Program Formed, i
To Assist Freshmen Men .  

. by STEVE GITTELSON
There used to -be a dis-tinct species of s-tudents known to the
University as freshmen. If many students cannot distinguish these’-
freshmen from their upperclass contemporaries, it is because of the:
recent creation of the Freshman Advisory Program. . 
The program, under the leadership of William Marcus, assis-,
tant dean of freshman affairs, and Chairman Ron Cowell, seeks to,
provide some structured continuity to the orientation of freshmen-

men.

primarily non- academic pro-
lems. Because it is impossible
to answer all questions in a

cribed a survey the Office of Ad- j
missions undertook to ﬁnd out
ten other state school ratios. The .
results found that all except the 7
University of Michigan, with an
out-of-state student ratio of 25_
per cent, were the same as the ,
University.
“Interestingly, Michigan does
no ourt-of-state recruiting,” stated
Kobosky. However, he later
noted that “We’ll be doing -as _.
much visiting as we’ve done in
the past ormore.” . 
Kobosky believes thatthe drop: _

due to a “new trend”- of- state-C

to ask himself this 'question:’, 
‘Why send my child , elsewhere '

 Advice Taken

.by ANNE DORN
‘ One ofthe many changes that

0 "has come to the University in

the past year is also one of the

' most obvious. A television ca-

mera and monitors have been
installed in L9, Clapp Hall. Ac-
cording to Dr. Stanley Shostack,
assistant professor of biology,
the television set-up will “make
biology, physics, chemistry, and

 other sciences as close to the

students’ experience as possi-

ble.”

Shostack explained that an
undergraduate student who was
in his general studies biology
course had the original idea. The
student felt that the television
could enlarge the detail work
not able to be seen by the class.
The suggestion was encouraged
by the Biology Department and
a committee was formed to in-

‘ vestigate the possibilities with

Shostack as chairman. Other
members of the committee in-
clude Dr. Kenneth Cummins, Dr.
Calvin Spector, and Dr. Harry

’ Corwin, all assistant professors

of biology.

Shostack commented that pre
serntly there is a “fervor for ex-
perirnental education and we

_need new approaches. The prob-
‘lems of education exceed tech-

nique in lecture. The subject

tmatter should be part of the

personal experience.” Dr. Shos-
tack maintains that the televi-
sion can help do this by teach-
ing students to be critical. “Stu-
dents have to be skeptical. The
essence of science is question-

ing. If we don’t do that, we fail.

The student should be aware
that the textbook doesn’-t cor-

respond to life.”

Shostack elaborated on the
possibilities of the educational
television. He stated that it
could be used as an opaque pro-
jector, as a wide angle lens, or
as an enlarger. For the kinds
of demonstrations that can’t be
shown in the classroom, the in-
structor may use the portable
television tape recorder. With
use of these facilities, “the re-
lation between the lab and re-
search problems could be made
more clear.”

The set-up, which was install-
ed during the last two weeks of
August, includes ten monitors
with 23-inch screens distributed
throughout the lecture room. In
the front is a table with a moni-
tor. Above the table is a cam-
era pointing down, focusing on
the instructor's demonstrations.
Shostack credits Jack Elliott of
the Electronic Products Corpor-
ation with a major portion of
help in parts and design. -Dr.
Shostack pointed out that other
departments in addition to bio-
logy may use the television fa-
cili-ties. Several science depart-
ments, including physics and
chemistry, have already express-
ed a want.

Shostack emphasized the fact
that it would be impossible to
ignore the students’ reaction to
the televisions. “The professor
has the role of communicating
with the students, although it
is the students’ responsibility to
understand what the instructor
is saying. We must remember,
however, that we’re using tele-
vision, andllwe must judge our
techniques on the students’ re-

TV Installed In Clapp Hall

action.”

If the present television tech-
nique is successful, Dr. Shosack
sees other uses. One suggestion
is‘ a recitation, half of which
could be “canned lecture” over
television, and half a discussion
of the lecture. In this way, “the
student has a chance to say
what he thinks when he’s think-
ing it.”

Dean David Halliday of the
Division of the Natural Sciences
commented that he is “very
pleased” to have the television
equipment. He added that Lang-
ley Hall, Clapp Hall, and the
new Crawford Hall are connect-
ed with a television circuit, and
television communications may
be used in the buildings in the
future. “The project can be ex-
tended,” he stated. “If it works,
we may acquire new equip-
ment.”

make it possible for the Univer-
sity to continue its atmospheric
research.

Part of the grant will be used
at the University’s air glow ob-
servatory on Laurel Hill Moun-
tain. The'work at the observa-
tory centers around the radia-
tion glow which Dr. M. A. Bion-
di, professor of physics, explain-
ed as a “gentle, consistently
uniform glow which is present
at all times.” Theair glow is
caused by sodium and oxygen
atoms in the upper atmosphere.
Observations are made during
the daylight, twilight, and night
at the observatory.

The money will also be used
to participate in the NASA

tion to study radiation in the

University Benefits fromStudy of Rats

by DIANE. McDONALD
A long, dusty road winds its
way through groups of trees,
and widens out into a small
parking lot. On one side of the
lot stands a old wooden farm-
house; on t-he other, a modern,
one-story, concrete building. In-
side this building, in wire cages
stacked on rows of shelves, thou- V
sands of experimental rates are
. ‘being raised by a team of re-
ggﬁ searches.
‘ ’ 'I‘:he Zivic-Miller laboratory, in
Allison Park, Pa., was founded
to fill an area need for research

animals. William J. Zivic and
George S. Miller, classmates and
graduates of Regis College in
Colorado, hit upon the labora-
tory idea while both were work-
ing in New Jersey after grad-
uation. Miller, a technician test-
ing new drugs for a pharmaceu-
tical company, and Zivic, teach-
ing biology at a south Jersey
high school, both noticed a lack
of animals for researching sci-
entists. Desiring, both to ﬁll this
this need and to set up their
own experimenting center, they
decided to move to Pittsburgh

and begin work. While Zivic
worked with the University's
Medical School, Miller research-
ed their subject extensively in
area libraries. Finally they
bought 25 acres of land with
the farmhouse and began.set-
ting up their laboratory.

The laboratory is vital to the
area because of its dual pur-
pose. Not only does it _offer fast,
efficient delivery of rates to pri-
vate and public scientiﬁc con-
cerns, but also serves as a test-
ing center itself. The Universi-

A ceeding the values of the

property owners have taken
advantage of a shortage of
student housing and have
forced members of the Uni-

the high rents or live on the

A Proble

m To Conquer

sity of Michigan have a comparable rate of out-of-state students (eight
to ten per cent). However, we do not classify our University with state
schools, for although we .are now state-related, we are not a state uni-
versity. We had hoped that our affiliation with the state would not cause
this University toenroll almost entirely Pennsylvania students. _
Obviously, other factors affected the eight per cent statistic of
out-of-state students in this year’s freshman class, but the fact remains
that if this University wants to maintain what Mr. Kobosky calls a real-
istic out-ofstate percentage (25 per cent), it has a massive task before it.
We urge the administration to expend its energies to ﬁnd a solu-
tion to this problem. More intensive recruitment must, of course, be tried.

The phrase “the 2,000 best” has been used to describe this year’s
freshman class. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of our freshmen are from
/Pennsylvania, a far cry from a few years ago when 30 per cent of our
 enrollment was comprised of out-of-state students. A
’ Upon reading the above statistics, students may have a tendency
» to place the blame on our status as a state-related University. However,
as Director of Admissions Bernard J. Kobosky pointed out, more and
more states are developing programs. to provide lower tuition for their
. residents. A referendum will be before the voters in New York this No-
vember to determine whether to have free state universities. Lower~‘or free
tuition in the student’s home state cannot help but unfavorably affect the
chances of his attending school out-of-state.
The very fact that only 29 per cent of the out-of-state applicants
. ' accepted compared to the usual 50 per cent ﬁgure only serves to reinforce
1 the above argument. Also, the new dormitories will not be completed for
several years, and this factor severely limits the number of resident stu-
dents our University can accept.

and a bath. Another landlord
on Oakland Ave. is charging
$100 a month for another

Ordinances specify that an
apartment must have a com-

a commode, a sink, and a

bath and/or shower. But how _

many student “apartments”
comply with this section of
the law? Most students are
forced to share a bath with
other tenants, and where the
law may permit this it does
indicate that only seven peo-

The landlords have the stu-
dents over a barrel and they
know it.

IN AREAS like East Lib-
erty, where the quality of
apartments available is
roughly similar to th-ose in
Oakland, the rents appear to
be more equitable. Efficien-
cies rent for $40 to $50 a
month and‘ three room "apart-
ments can be had fo‘r‘$80‘to
$90. But for most students
moving to East Liberty is
out of the question. Not only
is it far fr-om most of their
friends and activities, but

even more important, few

students who want to escape

the high rents in Oakland_
would want to spend the 60

cents per day carfare or in-
vest in a car and pay a dol-

, lar a day in parking charges.

Okland thus remains the only
practical 1-ocation where a
University student can live
without undue inconvenience.

With each increase in the
size of the University’s stu-

dent population, the housing

situation becomes more cri-
tical. It can be expected that
rents will rise rather than
fall as apartments become
more and more scarce. The

student is on his own when i

he goes looking for an apart-
ment; he either accepts the
/high rents and the slum-like
conditions or looks elsewhere.
There is no united student
‘body at the University which
could put pressure to bear
on the landlords, and the Uni-
versity administration does
not appear to be aware of
the problem. But. the ques-
tions then become why is
there no true Student Union,
an organization of all stu-
dents, which could act as a
bargaining agent not just
for apartments but for park-
ing facilities and store dis-
counts‘? And why does the
administration maintain a si-
lent position on the problem?
These are questions which
must be answered if the ex-
ploitation is to_ be stopped.

Director Explains
Ecuador Project

Editor, The Pitt News:

The University of Pittsburgh
is becoming constantly more in-
volved in international pro-
grams, both on campus and
aboard. University personnel are
already engaged in everything
from million-dollar programs in
institution building to small,
one-man, research projects in
many foreign countries. An in-
creasing number of the disci-
plines and the professions are
a-ccent_ing international aspects
in their course offerings.

All these activities have, of
couse, contributed to in varying
degrees to a greater “interna-
tional awareness’ on the part of
the Pitt student. But by -and
large, ‘these highly stimul-ating
international developments have

been limited essentially to fac-

ulty-to-faculty or facu1ty-to-stu-
dent relationships.

For example, I recently re-
turned to campus from a two
year tour of duty at Universi-
dad Central, Quito, Ecuador,
where Pitt has been engaged in
an institution building program
for the last fouryears. As many
as 14 Pitt professors at a time
have been serving there in all
phases of academic work, in-
structional as well as adminis-
trative. It has been a tremen-
dously interesting experience for
those of us who went to Quito,
but it has also been a P-itt-fac-

faculty to Central-student-‘body
relationship. A I

Most of my Ecuadorian stu-
dents expressed a keen interest

‘in, but often showed a marked

misconception of, their Ameri-
can counterparts. They were

/anxious to know about these

similarities and differences. They
continuously a s k e d questions
about American students’ study
habits, student governments, stu-
dent strikes and demonstrations,
student politics on and off cam-
pus, studen~t~profess'or and stu-
dent - administration relation-
ships, dating practices, student
organizations, student ﬁnancial
and working problems, etc."

While our Pitt students are
perhaps not as highly conscious
of their Latin neighbors as their
Latin neighbors are conscious
of them, I am sure they, too,
could be interested in many as-
pects of -student life in Ecuador.

As An Important Time
In A Student’s Life

Tonight, many freshman.and a good number of sophomores
will attend the Interfraternity Council's smoker. The IFC smoker
marks the beginning of fraternity rush for the fall term.

To the incoming freshman and perhaps to the sophomore who
has just transferred to the University, fraternity rush may be quite
a new experience. If taken the wrong way, fraternity rush can be
an unfortunate experience.

Louis Mclainden, assistant dean of men for fraternities, is
aware of this fact. Mchinden has compiled the following number of
tips for freshmen concerning fraternity rush:

>~ When rushing, the freshman should be natural. He shouldn’t
force or try to monopolize a conversation. The rus-hee should be
friendly and meet as many rushees as possi'ble.

> The rushee should be observant. He should notice the house

’ and its overall cleaniness. He should also take note of the standards

of dress, the behavio-r, and the language used in the various houses.

. > During the rush period, the rushee should not devote all of his

time to one fraternity.

> When rushing a fraternity, the aspiring Greek should attempt
to meet the entire brotherhood. A . '

> No one should be impressed with any fraternity which attempts
an illegal rush. The rushee should take heed of the fraternity that
criticizes another house (fraternity). This denotes a weak fraternity!

There are other considerations that M'cLinden pointed out.
tor in the rushee’s ﬁnal decision on a fraternity.

->‘ The academic standing ofthe fraternity should be a major" fac-

'> The rushee should look carefully at t-he seniors of the frater-
nity that he rush-ing. By doing this, he can decide What four
years of life in each particular fraternity Would be like.
'> Sophomores and juniors should also be carefully observed by
the rushee. These are the men that the rushee might be living with
for the next ‘two or three years. -
> The overall respectability of the brothers should be taken int0
account. The rushee should ask h-i-mself if he would Want the mem-
bers of a fraternity to -be his life-longifriends.  L j 
D The rushee must also realize his own responsibilityto the group
he wants to’ pledge. He must know what is expected of him during
'his pledge
> The question of ﬁnancial responsibility is of considerable_ im-
portance. The rushee must ask himself whether. or not he can af-
ford the -extra expenses of fraternity life.
With these tips in mind, the rushee can best pick the fraternity
‘ which he is suited for. “There is a wide variety of fraterniﬁes °n
this campus,” says Dean McLinden. Thus» there is ‘#1 fraterflity
suited for everyone who wishes to rush. Don’t pick the W1‘0n8 0119-

Merits of Greek System

An Essential Step

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN

At the interfr-aternity
smoker tonight, hundreds of
freshmen will get their ﬁrst
exposure to the Greek sys-
tem. But after an hour of
shaking hands and picking
up rush schedules, the po-
tential Greeks will know lit-
tle more about fraternities
than they did this afternoon.
Even rush itself gives a dis-
torted vtiew of fraternity
life. Only actual pledgin-g will
give the freshman the personal,
subjective experience he needs
in order to know what fraterni-
ties are truly all about on this
campus.

During pledging, mos-t boys
are more actually involved in
fraternity life than they ever
are as brothers. While a brother
may pay his dues, go to par-

' ties and otherwise ignore his

fraternity, a pledge is required
to participate in the house and
social life, athletic activities and
work on charity drives of his
house. A pledge must conform
and -be an individual at the same
time. He must reﬂect the image
of his particular house to the
campus while he is being judged
by the brothers as an individual
worthy or unworthy of mem-
bership.

A pledge experiences all the

’

advantages and d_isadvantages of '

fraternity l~.ife.-;.,If .-he needs a _ ,

date, or aid in school Work, he
has up to 100 brothers to help
him.,But if there is cleaning up
or other dirty Work to be done,
the standard proceedure is, “Let
the pledges do it.”

Because we are here primari-
ly for an education and not to
clean up fraternity houses, ev-
ery boy mu-stknow what effect

-. lllllllf

  Fraternity Supplement     
Freshman Rush Is Seen Pledging Demands Nfaturityy
Ability to Work with Others

pledging will have on his grades.
The pressure of pledging on a.
boy’s studies is ironic. While
pledging can take much needed
time, effort and energy away
from studying, a pledge can not
be initiated as a full brother if

‘he does not make grades. _
"Getting used to college life

while going through the de-
mands of pledging is a lot to
ask of a ﬁrst term freshmen.
Most make it. Pledging is like
‘being on the football team or
writing for the Pitt News or'be-
ing /in Student Government; a
boy must learn how to budget
his time and how to get down
to studying when he should.

A fraternity can help. A pledge
can ﬁnd a brother with almost
any given major in his house to
tutor him. Each house has -a
ﬁle with old tests and papers
available to pledges.

The brothers know a high schol-
astic average for their house
will help in rush, and they are
in competition with the other
houses. Each brother is a. for-
mer pledge and he knows when
to make a pledge stop shining
his shoes and when to make
him study.

Louis K. McLinden is the new
assistant dean of men in charge
of fraternities. He was a broth-
er in Delta Tau Delta here from
1947-51. As an administrator and
former pledge, Dean McL-inden
ﬁrmly believes that pledging has
no detrimental effect upon a

boy’s studies. He explains, “Any- .

thing can be detrimental; it en-
tirely depends upon the individ-
ual.” Pledging is a ﬁne excuse
to avoid school work if a boy
is looking forpan excuse.
McLinden added that While he
was an undergraduate pled-gin-g.
actually -helped his studies. “I
wanted so much to become a
brother, that during my pledge

. ing to live in a fraternity. 

 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
    
  
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
 
   
  
   
  
   
 
  
  
    
 

term I studied hard enough to
be sure I made grades.”
The time and energy ‘require _
to pledge and make grades force,
a boy to learn the maturity ‘and;
responsibility he will need in‘
college. This demand is not the
only pressure on a pledge. Theo.
IFC consists of social fraterni-1
ties and some require their
pledges to get dates for par-I
ties and other affairs. Every
brother Will help a pledge get?
dates, but if the pledge 
he may have to tend the 
clean up afterward or even 'act;
as a bouncer. . .
Another pressure is participa
tion in fraternity actzivirtiesg \
pledge isencouraged if notr
quired to try out or root for
tramural teams, Greek Sing an‘
to help buﬂd_ Homecoming ﬂoa.ts;_-
or Greek Week chariots. "‘No{

Pledging is the period when;
every boy will be most active}.
ly and most selﬂessly involved
in fraternity life. Almost every
rushee will hear that the pledge
period is the best time in fra-
ternity life. If a _boy can handle

no MATTER what any critic of 1

av Ehe cannot disclaim the worth of the

-' Greek (fraternity) system to the col-

case at the University!

Throughout the years the Greek
system has provided the University
iwith its ﬁnest leaders. It has organ-

Edent but has also stressed scholarship.

recognize a signiﬁican-t point.

They don't realize that each and
every fraternity is deeply concerned
about all -the rushees who enter their
respective houses. They don't realize
that the selective “bidding” procedure
is, in essence,’ for the good of the
rushee.

ON THE other hand, it is essen-
tial to point out that each fraternity
on this campus is a diverse group of
individuals molded together in a com-
mon environment. Each fraternity at
the University has its liberals and
conservatives, its doves and hawks,
and its scholars and leaders.

The four year experience of a fra-
ternity can never be replaced by sim-
ple membership in a ordinary organ-
ization. Fraternity life is four years
of. fun, excitement, spirit, and broth-
erly enthusiasm. It is four years of
healthy and maturing activities.

Yet, a fraternity is more than a
community service drive or an all-
night bidding session. It is more than
a dress-up party or a stag night. It.
is more than practicing for Greek
sing or going to football games. Fra-

ternity is a living experience,

conventions nor are they ‘ the well-

not the sole bulwark of a moral racial
prejudice and behavior. Fraternities

Perhaps I judge too harshly——-at
least on the last issue. Some fraterni-
ties, in the tradition of B’nai B’rith
have even done their all
for social reform, e.g. admitting a few
underprivileged black brothers (“tan”
is a better adjective) * or sending let-

Formereooter Tries Foot
-Zurzolo Improves a Kicer

by ROY JACOBS

A few years back the Gogolaks, Pete at Princeton and
Charles at Cornell, started the soccer-style placekickﬁng
trend that has since become the in-thing forfootball teams
at all levels of professional, college, and high school competition.
So far be it from Dave Hart and his 1967 Panthers to buck the tide.
However, it’s still not a case of a former soccer star coming
out of nowhere to cure the team's age old -placekick-ing woes. By

his own admission, Bill Zurzola
was “never more than adequate”
as a soccer player for coach Leo
Bemis and he needs “an awful
lot of work with a center and
holder” before he becomes a
good placekicker.

Also, Bill -has to worry about
the stiff competition he’s re-
ceiving from sophomore Joe
McCain, a conventional kicker.
It's all enough to make one
wonder why he would give up
soccer after playing the sport
for ten seasons.

“I felt as if I had reached a
dead end,” explained Bill. “I

wasn’t making as much a con- —

tribution as I would have liked.
I didn’t think I was helping the
school as much as I can by kick-
ing ﬁeld goals.”

Actually, the switch was large-
ly prompted by an ankle injury
Bill suffered in spring soccer
practice. -

“I was taking courses during
the summer and my ankle was-

n't coming around. I ﬁgured I
probably wouldn't last the whole
soccer season.” But he decided
to try kicking just to keep in
shape and get some exercise.
To his surprise, Bill met with
a fair amount of success from
as far as 40 yards out. He got a
tryout from the coaches and
was impressive enough to be in-
vited to fall camp. From then
till now, it’s been a story of
hard work.

“I’m convinced that once I get
the hang of it I’ll be .more ac-
curate and drive it better. I get

stronger every day. Within‘ a

month I’ll be accurate from 40‘
to 45 yar .”

But the season -starts in less
than two weeks and 1:-hat’s where
the competition from McCain
comes in. Joe has been kicking
since high school and he kicked
placements for the frosh last
year.

“It’s up to the coaches Wheth-

mmwroaxanmoeom.

SPECIALIST BILL ZURZOLA turned down his third consecutive
soccer season and is trying to kick ﬁeld goals for the Panthers. Us- ‘

ing the sideways kicking stance, he has been getting good distance.

er or not I'll be ready. I h-ave to.

prove to them that I can kick
under pressure.” In fact, Bill's
worried about even staying
around.

“I hope that they keep me for
the season. There’s possibility
that I can’t catch McCain for a
couple games. I'm not used to
sitting on the bench, but even if
1 can play half a season, r11 be
making a contribution.” Most
important, even McCain is on
Bill's side.

“The coaches are testing him,”
said Joe. f‘I think, he can do the
job. After a touchdown drive,
I’-ll be too tired to kick a ﬁeld
goal. It’d be nice to bring some-
body off the bench to, kick -it.”

It’d be nice ‘fofctghe varsity to

With the soccer season
only three days away one
question remains unanswer-
ed; will the sophomores

come through?
Coach Leo Bemis has six sol-

id returnees in his starting line- .
' up. He has Lenny Harmo-n at

goal, Ernest Mouen and Dave
Shimpeno as halfbacks, Gary
Foertsch and Pete Snyder as
forwards, and Joe Krut-h at cen-
ter fullback.

But six out of 11 isn't enough.

Shalk, who saw little action on
the varsity squad last year, ap-
pears to have won, a starting
spot at left fullback. \

The other spots will probably
be ﬁlled by sophomores. Norm
Reux and Ron Mielecki are ﬁght-
ing for starting berth at right
fullback. Bob Quinlan, a co-cap-
tain on last year’s freshman
team, will start at left halfback.

Bemis switches him to right

Right wing remains the big
gap. This week's ﬁnal practices
might help Bemis decide. He
has a long list of players to
choose from. Terry Wyler, a
senior who is big, but slow, has
played the most time in the scrim-
mages. Juniors Norm Schull-
itian, Billy Gray, Jeff Heimberg,
and Angelo S-toyes are also be-
