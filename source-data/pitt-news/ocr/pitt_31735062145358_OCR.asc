Authentic Stone

Polish Room Receives Cornice
From University Of Krakow

 

 

The cornerstone for the Polish room
in the Cathedral, 2. cornice piece from
the’ university house in which
Copernicus, the ﬁfteenth‘ century
astronomer, lived while a student in
the University of Krakow, Poland,
has come into the possession of the
University. Ruth ‘Crawford Mitchell,
adviser to the nationality rooms in
the Cathedral, has received the piece
in her offices.

The stone was extracted from the
cellar of the Collequim Maius, the
original University of Krakow, founded
by King Casimir the Great in 1364,
and renovated more than 50 years
ago by King Wladyslaw Jagiello. The
great seal on the cornice, bearing the
Polish royal eagle, and -the signature
on thecornice document of the rector
at Krakow, attest the authenticity of
the stone. At the request of the com-
mittee for the Polish room in the
Cathedral, permission ‘was granted by
the rector of the University of Kra-
kow to remove the stone to Pitts-
burgh. Dr_ Matusin-ski, the Polish
consul in Pittsburgh, received the
stone and transferred it to the Uni-
versity, f

The basic architectural elements in
the design for the Polish classroom
were taken from the Jagiellonia
library, a unit of the University of
Krakow.

Mayor,-Elect McNair
Leads Economics
Discussions

At 11:30 o’clock Thursday,
William N. McNair, mayor-elect
of Pittsburgh, led a discussion i11
L. T. Conway's four-‘hour’ eco-
nomics class in Room 107, Alumni
hall.

Mr. McNair spoke of the single
tax, of the graded tax, and the
economic phases of municipal ad-
ministration. He expressed con-
ﬁdence in the passage of his ﬁve-
to-one real estate tax plan by the
present of the state legislature.
He also stated that he was op-
posed to the sale of personal
property for delinquent taxes.

The question, proposed by the
mayor-elect himself, which caused
the most discussion was, “Does
economic rent, when raised by
land taxation, cause an increase
in prices which fall ﬁnally upon
the consumer?’ Mr. McNair left
the question unanswered. He
agreed, however, that if this were
true there would be no reason to
increase the tax rate on property
in the downtown district.

When the meeting was cut
short by the end of the hour, Mr.
McNair was besieged by a crowd
of enthusiastic students who
wanted to continue the discussion.

‘ Collembola In Action
Shows Pitt News
They’re Sane

Recently an editorial in the Pitt
News called attention to Collembola,
honorary biology fraternity, and to
the queer and strange “creatures”
therein—“in such a manner,” quoting
one co-ed Zoo major, “as to make me
feel positively buggy.” Members of
Collembola accepted this -slur in
silence. Meanwhile they kept their
eyes open for a chance to prove that
they really aren’t human idiosyn-
crasiesebut only plodding seekers
after the light of knowledge—like the
rest of us.

That chance has ﬁnally arrived.
Tonight from 9 to 12 o’clock Collem-
bola in conjunction with Quax, will
dance and cut capers at Heinz; House
at a Christmas party——and all bugs
and animals will be checked outside
the door.

The scientists will dance to the
music of the Keystone melody boys’
orchestra. .

Bean bag relays and novelty races
will be included in the game repertoire
‘—with some of the games vigorous
enough to slow up the “phys-ed”
majors. In one corner there’1l un-
doubtedly be a place for everything
from Old Maids to Contract. One
of the “Profs” sees to that. _

;~ There’ll be punch, too——and maybe
;doughnuts and apples——dissecting
gfrogs makes healthy appetites.

; Says one little scientiﬁc girl,
:“They’re good-old-fashioned parties
where. everyone does what he wants
to and has a rollicking time.”

But to the, Pitt News staff and
other skeptics, Collembola and Quax
say, “Come up to the Heinz House

side of the laboratory,

 

Informal Affair To Take Place

Foreman, Price Chosen As Leads

In Players’ ‘Children Of The Moon’

S  Let  Who Worries

About His Studies
Read This

' “Study won’t hurt you?”

Maybe this will come as a surprise,
but according to Dr. Alfred G. Dietze,
assistant professor of psychology, it’s
perfectly true. ‘

‘.‘I’ve never heard of a student
cracking u11der the strain of over-
work,” theidoctor explained in an in-
terview. “Many students have become
abnormal, but study was not on of the
factors responsible,” he commented.

Unhygienic habits together with

,intense worry have caused most of

the nervous ‘breakdowns -among stu-
dents, Dr. Dietze held. “If you study
15 hours a day, sleep but six, and
worry ‘continually about grades, you
are ':quite apt to develop some ab-
normal complex.” '

Irritabiiity, outbursts of temper,
absent—mindedness are all symptoms of
an approaching breakdown. If the
conditions remain unchanged and the
person is naturally unstable, a nerv-
ous breakdown may easily result.

For the over-worked, worrying, and
nervous student fearing some kind of
trouble, Dr. Dietze advises a complete
change in he_alth-habits, “Sleep more,
eat less, exercise, enjoy yourself, and
above all, don’t worry.’’'"

Siedle Sets Applications
Deadline For Tomorrow

 

According to Theodore A. Siedle,
assistant to the dean of the School
of Education, the ﬁnal date for appli-
cation for admission to Education '7,
for the second semester, has been ex-
tended to Wednesday, December 20.
This course, introduction to teaching,
is among the requirements in Penn-
sylvania for provisional college cer-
tiﬁcate. Students must have com-
pleted this course as well as other
required education courses before
they may take practice teaching,
Siedle stated.

Advance notice of the student’s in-
tention to pursue the course is need-
ed to enable the education oifice to
arrange observation assignments in
nearby public schools, explained Mr.

Siedle.

Non-Fraternity Alli_a.nce

LTHOUGH THERE IS A PLACE on the campus for

a student political group to oppose the “coalition”

forces, students who have become interested in such a

venture might well realize that the appeal for the inde-

pendent student vote on the campus must lie in a direc-

tion other than “spoils” or mere defeat of the group that

is now in power. Refusal of independent students last

week to align themselves with any fraternity group

speaks well for the motives of the newly organized non-
fraternity alliance.

A platform including more than more suggestions of
change in appointing dance chairmen will have to be set
up by the independent leaders if they expect to gain any
quantity of votes in the spring election. Dance chair-
manships have long been the bone of contention of right-
eous young campus reformers who set out to straighten
the politics of the campus along more or less Utopian
lines. And it just happens that dance chairmanships are
minor and unimportant positions in the work of any un-
dergraduate student legislative group. And if the worst
comes to worst, we must admit that dance chairmanships
SHOULD be given to fraternity men, because fraterni-
ties, for the most part, support university dances.

I-IE‘ NON-FRATERNITY ALLIANCE, or whatever

name it chooses to call itself, must present a deﬁnite,
progressive, and attractive program in the spring elec-
tions if it hopes to pierce the popularity of the “coali-
tion.” It may be added here that, as student councils go,
this year’s body has shown signs of activity that former
councils would either not have dared to undertake or
would be indifferent to. A deﬁnite program, and a deﬁn-
ite program only, must be offered by the non-fraternity
group if it hopes to make an impressive showing at the
polls.

A political ﬁght on the campus this spring will be
relished. Organization of this new non-fraternity alli-
ance should be welcomed as a sign of increasing student
interest in campus legislative affairs. It is a sad com-
mentary that the usual run-of-the-mine non-fraternity
student in the past has contented himself with attend-
ing class, lightly scanning the columns of the college
paper, and leaving the campus promptly after his last
class. And, following their graduation, most of these
students have been heard to condemn Pitt’s “uncolle-
giate atmosphere” and to complain because others held
the offices and did the real work on the campus.

If the non-fraternity alliance does nothing more, it will
at least be a conclusive indication whether or not the
non-fraternity student on the campus is as interested in
campus affairs as he claims to be, or whether students
who ARE interested and who WILL work shall remain
in control of campus legislative positions.

, We CAN Get Fare Reductions!
N OBVIOUSLY defeatist attitude has taken posses-
sion of most students on the campus regarding pos-
sible reductions in trolley fares for students of the three
Pittsburgh universities. Student legislators of all three
schools are going through the motions of a concerted
effort on the project, but Christmas vacation time is here
and the data for presentation to the street railways com-
pany hasn’t yet been completed!

The Pitt News believes that substantial reductions in‘
trolley fare rates for students CAN be effected if stu-
dents of the three schools really wish such a projectto
go through. However, little comment has been heard
from the student body at large on the Pitt campus con-
cerning the work of Council on this matter, and this
comment has largely ended in the current American res-
ignation, “What’s the use?”

F STUDENTS ON THE PITT campus are interested

in getting trolley fare rate reductions, the Pitt News
would like to hear from some of them. We have been
under the opinion this semester that students who are
attending the University this year are doing to under
trying ﬁnancial circumstances. We have upheld our,con-
tention that students who insist on going to college dur-
ing these times must be really interested in education.
And we thought that these same students are interested
in reduced trolley rates. Maybe we have been wrong all
the time. Perhaps Pitt students are really rolling in
wealth and care for nothing more at Pitt than the Junior
Prom or a. basketball game!

Student interest will get reduced trolley fare rates.
Student council representatives can have all the ﬁgures
they want, they can have the soundest arguments, yet,
if the student body maintains its silence on the question
with its implication of indifference, not a great deal will
be done about the matter!

Yes, Mr. Weir!

R. WEIR, THE STEEL MAN, and the NRA are
“having it out” much to the interest of the college
students in government and economics who relish this
battle between Rugged Individualism and Social Control.
Although on the face of the situation it might appear to
be a personal ﬁght betwee-n NRA and Mr. Weir, it would
be more logical to conclude that it is a battle between
the capitalistic steel interests as a whole and the Na-
tional Recovery Administration.

Mr. Weir and his contemporaries in capitalism have
been long steeped in the economic philosophy which has
allowed personal ambition to run riot, the economic phil-
osophy which, following its self-inﬁicted First World
War, ﬁnds itself struggling for existence in a maelstrom
into which it has blindly tossed itself. In an economic
society -in which every m.an’s greed was his business vir-
tue, and in which economic planning‘ was anathema to
well-fed, indolent ﬁnanciers, Mr. Weir’s contemporaries in
capitalism might Well have swayed the sceptres and ut-
tered the words.of wisdom of “unearned increment,”
“dividends,” “proﬁts,” and “free enterprise.” At the pres-
ent stage in which capitalism ﬁnds itself, today’s in-dus-
trial and ﬁnancial leaders should not think of themselves
as “pioneers” or champions of free enterprise. The day
of economic pioneering is over and the picture of .“free
enterprise” is a. beautiful mirage, as beautiful as it is
flimsy. .

TUDENTS IN AMERICAN COLLEGES and universi-

ties are beginning to wonder what the situation is
all about. Many of their better-read and more-informed
student-leaders are quick to condemn Mr. Weir and his
contemporaries for their obstruction of the social con-
trol ‘scheme presented by NRA. Whether the world’s
economic order will pass from the socio-psychological en-
vironment of peasant villages and industrial urban cen-
ters, as some professors aver, to a planned social and
economic order distinctly urban without a more revolu-
tionary change than NRA is a serious problem for college
students who, within the next one or two years, will
ﬁnd themselves in the very center of the process.

The Un1vers1ty’s Stand

R. BOWMAN’S STAND on the refusal of the Univer-
sity to accept a-federal loan for the completion of
the Cathedral is one backed by sound business logic with
an eye on the welfare of the University. Consistently
criticized of late by a press, eager to see the building
ﬁnished, Dr. Bowman has stood by his opinion in a man-
ner which has characterized his supervision of the con-

struction of the Cathedral for the past several years.

Pittsburgh newspapers have scored the refusal of the
Federal loan and have lamented the present state of the
Cathedral as a. picture of Pittsburgh's impotence. They
have failed to take into consideration the ﬁnancial wel-
fare of the University, however.

Students of the University, of course, are interested in
seeing the Cathedral completed. Conditions in " 1e build-
ing today are such that hamper work that students could
do. The crowded atmosphere in Room 801, Cathedral
where most University activities have their ofﬁces,
where the ofﬁces of the dean of men, assistant to the
dean of men, employment bureau, and cooperative buy-
ing association are located, is not conducive to the best
work that students can turn out. In winter the halls
are chilly; some rooms overheated. .

But regardless of all these conditions, students of the
University can, and will, wait for the completion of the
Cathedral. To most of us it typiﬁes Pitt. We know that
nothing worth while was ever made in a hurry.

Dr. Bov-.rman’s administration of the ﬁnancial affairs
of the University since he has been Chancellor of the
school presents a pleasant picture, and has been consist-

ently based on sound business policy. VVe believe that

in this instance, too, Dr. Bowman must be right. He is

certainly ﬁghting hard enough.

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg

OUT OF THE COMPLEXITY of events in the United States in the
recent past Father Coughlin, the social crusader of Detroit, has
come forth as a ﬁgure of great importance, reaching the point at
which his opinions age held as invioiable by several million people
and his ideas are likely to have some effect on public policy.
Father Goughlin’s fame has led many people to examine his
purpose and philosophy, with many reaching the conclusion that he

is radical and dangerous.
hardly so. Father Coughlin is not a
particularly radical thinker and he is
only possibly dangerous. He is, in-
deed, a. true Democrat, a sincere be-
lieverin individualism and a. faithful
upholder of the principles of cap-
italism. His attacks are simply
directed against the fashion in which
the system is working at present and
at those who are in control_
HE MOST RECENT ATTACKS of
Father Coughlin have been directed
against the ﬁnancial interests of the
country, against especially J , P. Mor-
gan, who, he stateshcontrols forty
billions of Wealth. Mr. Morgan is an
excellent example of a powerful in-
dividual, a.nd I rather envy Father
Coughlin the facilities with which he
may spread about his remarks on Mr.
Morgan. But, despite excellent facil-
ities, all Father Coughlin can say is
that J. P. Morgan is too powerful and
that ﬁnancial power should be divorced
from industrial power. Very good.‘ If
it were at all possible, it might be
a fairly reasonable» idea. But it is
not possible and to attack our present
situation from Father Coughlin’s angle
is to miss the point of our present
situation. The present American cap-
italistic system has reached the stage
where absentee ownership, control of
industry by ﬁnance, has become an
integral part of our economy. Finan-
cial control was an inevitable trend
in the flow of our economic life and
could not be prevented.

Father Coughlin is similar to the

many well-known Western orators of
the past. They refused for some reason
or other to see that in the present
capitalistic system there is a con-
tinual and irresistible movement
toward certain economic forms, such
as the large corporation and the
destruction of competition, the sys-
tem of absentee ownership, and the
ever increasing pressure toward ex-
tension of government power. Any
really intelligent remedy for our dis-
tress must take into consideration
these movements of the entire sys-
tem and must work with the trends,
not against them. You cannot, any
longer, divorce ﬁnance from industry,
as Father Coughlin evidently wishes.
All you can do is to try to control
them.
ATHER 'COUGHLIN’S FAITH‘ in
capitalism is evidenced by his cry
recently for proﬁts for the in-
dustrialist and the laborer. At present,
according to his statement, the ﬁnan-

ciers force the industrialists to pay‘

low wages, thus preventing the work-
ing man from receiving a fair share
of the returns of industry. I doubt
very much that the employer has be-
come as intelligent aperson as Father
Coughlin thinks he is. The industrial-
ist, if his attitude towards the NRA
is any indication, still possesses the
same ideas and desires that he had in
1929.

But it is Father Coughlin’s estimate
of the necessity for proﬁts that is im-
portant, not his estimate of the in-
dustrialist’s willingness to pay high
wages. It is becoming more and more
evident, I believe, that proﬁts caused
the depression and are going to pre-
vent a really lasting recovery. Our
capitalistic system is such that proﬁts
mean a need for capital investment
and since we have no ﬁeld for capital
investment, we have no place for
proﬁts, no capital investment and no
prosperity. As long as we have a
system under which substantial proﬁts
are the results of ordinary business,
just so long will we have an economy
of chronic crises and chronic de-
pressions. Father Coughlin does not
seem to agree to this. He wants
proﬁts. He may say that he desires
only a small margin of proﬁts_ In or-
der that capitalism be workable, the
margin of proﬁts must be small in-
deed. And even Father Coughlin will
admit, I think, that small proﬁts are
psychologically impossible under cap-
italism with its control of industry by
a mere handful of men, Father Cough-
lin may then say that we should not
have such a control. Perhaps not,
but we have it, and we can’t take the
step of getting rid of it and going back
seventy-ﬁve years.

ATHER COUGHLIN’S ECONOM-
F ICS may not be ,wel‘—fou11d8d. but
his words carry weight. He is be-

coming more and more inﬂuential.
Justly so, perhaps. After all, Father
Coughlin is striking out with great
force against the evils of our present
society. Yet, despite his sincere ﬁght
for what he considers the interests of
the people, Father Coughlin may ul-
timately do more harm than good:-. He
is in a way obscuring the real Issue
that is growing more clear today.
The important decision that we are
going to have to make sooner orlater
is whether capitalism can exist at all,
not whether changes should bejmade.
Father Coughlin and his multitude of
supporters favor capitalism, .3 $119‘
ore-tical capitalism which is not even
the Inoshreasonable system. And S911‘-18
day, when: our choice as-'£Q_C3l3iii9-1.15m
or stern collectiyism is demanded,
Father Coughlin may very Well swing
many to retainthe obsolete present
society, rather than to try some new
and liejppy economy. Father Cough-
1in’s work will then be done. But so
will be his name.

Lamp-post

Wherein Explanation Of Intent
Is Avoided

INCE THE ANNEXATION of the

new head for this column, there
have been questions— I remember
distinctly that someone remarked on
it—as to the signiﬁcance of the
togaed young woman with the long
hail‘. the C108", and the tree, The rela-
tionship between the Lamp, Post and
the tree, You and the Wolfhound, and
the lady and Me is as clear as the’
view from the top of the ‘Cathedral
these December days. And one sub-
tle emanation per paper is probably
enough. The title, Between You, Me,
And The Lamp Post, is ungra.mmati-
cal. That may be indicative of some-
thing_ There is obviously no purpose
to the column. It's appalling. There
can be no explanation, no justiﬁca-
téon; there should be none; and here
1 IS.

Relationships, co—ordinations, and
purposes don’t seem important, some-
how, when two gentlemen meet in the
lamp’s yellow glare while the clock’s
story is still brief. Talk turns quickly
and naturally from rusty razor blades
and suicide to ﬁrelight, silken hose,
and golden hair. There are none of
the «silly formalities and impediments
to conversation such as logical se-
quence, etc. ‘Words come easily; they
signify nothing, but the vocal activity
is pleasing. Nothing makes much
difference. We see things in a dif-
ferent light: in a sort of golden haze,
Everything is just Between You, Me,
And The Lamp Post. There is no pur-
pose to anything, and that is as it
should be_ .

It is is that spirit that this column
is written. Long haired women, Rus-
sian wolfhounds, and trees have abso-
lutely nothing to do with it. The title
has positively nothing to do with the.
body of the column. There is no pur-
pose; none is intended. One has to
get used to this sort of thing, what
with Repeal and everything. The
ﬁrst experimentation may result in a
bit of nausea, and then there’s the
inevitable headache, of course, but
what’s that compared to the pleasure?

Is that an explanation, or is that an
explanation? It’s appalling. There is
no explanation, no justiﬁcation; there
should be none; there will be none.
It is promised. It is done.

At ﬁrst I attacked the department»

stores. “I want a gift,” I said in my
ﬁrmest manner to the blondined sales-
woman in the men’s wear department,
“Nothing elaborate, nothing expensive.
Just‘ for a friend. Perhaps you could
suggest . .’.’

“Yes, modom, perhaps something in
pastel monogramed suspenders?” I
demurred. No, really, after all . . .

“Perhaps a nice hand tooled leather
wallet?” N0, something more useful.

“Perhaps this nice muffler?” No,
green and orange plaid didn’t quite
express his personality. Something
more subtle.

On came the suggestions;
cravats, barred handkerchiefs, en-
graved cigarette cases, lounging robes,
gloves

I timidly explained that what I real-
ly wanted was a little gift for a friend,
not too elaborate, not too . . But
the blondined clerk was busy explain-
ing to an indignant soul why the de-
partment didn’t keep on hand beaded
Indian moccasins any more and I was
left alone with my sorrow and one
name on the crumpled shopping list
still unchecked.

On page six of that night’s paper

came the light.

Dear Cousin Carrie:

I am a sophomore in college,
have been going somewhat un-
steadily for a short time with a.
‘very nice college boy. He has
been very kind to me and I should
like to give him a little present
for ‘Christmas. Do you think this
would be right? VVha.t would you
suggest? He is of medium height
and has brown hair.

I have always admired you and
your ﬁne advice.

‘ WORRIED.

Dear Worried: .

I think it would be a friendly
gesture for you to give your
friend 9. little gift. By all means
give him nothing more personal
than a book or a subscription to a
magazine. A collection of short
stories or poems or a novel is al-
ways in good stead. Or ﬁnd out
his favorite magazine and give
him a year’s subscription. Or just
just send him a card. .

So I am sending him a Christmas
card. It has a. picture of Mickey
Mouse and a real cute little verse
something like:

Sincere wishes, ﬁne and true,

And Christmas greetings from me

to you.

After all. a card is always in good
taste’ and besides Dad has stopped all
the charge accounts in the department
stores. ‘It really isn’t the gift, as my
grandma always says, it’s the senti-
ment.

Department Store Girls
Scare College Youth
To Submission

By Charles A. Ruch

‘When the wise men brought to Beth-
lehem gifts of frankincense and myrrh,
they surely could not have known
what they were starting. At any rate,
every year at this time I ﬁnd myself
wishing that one or two of these wise
men would show up in a department
store and aid me in selecting a gift for
my girl friend. But, alas, nary a wise
one have I seen!

Of course, the department stores
have sensed this situation and have
provided some sort of convenient
a quick-thinking lass
listens to your troubles and then of-
fers a string of gift suggestions which
are just the thing for a charming
young blonde, or equally charming
young brunette, or for variations of
the same. But when the gift sug-

-gester reeled off to me a list of ar-

ticles ranging from a rowing machine
to a jar of molasses, I began to won-
der Why, after all, I preferred blondes.

While my mind was busy threshing
out these quaint suggestions, I wan-
dered unconsciously into the jewelry
department. That, brothers, is the
worst mistake you can possibly make!
Seven salesgirls addressed me at one
time and demanded to know for whom
I was buying and what I had in mind.
Without batting an eyelash, I replied,
“A jar of rowing machines.” When I
considered what I had just said, I was
moved to some very black thinking
concerning gift-suggesters in general.
Meanwhile, trays of compacts, brace-
lets, pendants, brooches, and what-
nots were being thrust under my eyes
by two salesgirls who were sure that
this or that was just the thing that
my girl friends would most appreciate.
One thought a rhinestone bracelet
would make her tremendously happy
while the other was sure that a lovely
necklace would make her happier, es-
pecially if she were ﬁve feet, six inch-
es tall——a bit of information which I
managed to slip in while the girls
were dropping seven compacts over
the ﬂoor.

Mumbling a few words to the effect
that my friend had all the jewelry she
could possibly wear at one time. I
moved hastily away and backed di-
rectly into the pocketbook and hand-
bag department where a dear old lady
told me she had just the thing I want-
ed. Now here Was a good Woman who
could see that I had a headache and
she was going to get me an aspirin
tablet. I waited. Out she came from
behind the row of stock cases and
she was loaded down, not with aspir--
in, but with an armful of bags which
she began to call “beaded,” “wooden-
beaded,’ “sequin,” “too1ed leather,”
and a host of other names, none of
which even faintly resembled “as-
pirin.“

It was only then that the advice
my dear grandmother had given me as
a child ﬁaslied back to my mind. I
found voice enough to interrupt the
lady with the handbag and say in a.
very decisive manner, “Yes, I’ll get
her handkerchiefs. She can always
use handkerchiefs.” -

by scores of economical engineers,

with the Lincoln highway, the mount-

chances of haying in somewhere for

detours on either route

Hitch-hiking, besides being a great
salve to dwindling pokes (Alaskan

moral lesson, an opportunity for so-

giving vent to all those pet theories

salesmen traveling solo for long dis-

than the cough of their engines,
they're suckers for a likely looking

Boxers Again

Two positions that were tliought. :1(‘Cll'{‘(’I_$' anchored at the begin--
ning of the boxing workouts seem to have shaken loose from their
nioorings and are adrift in the open ring. At. least four men are cast-
ing envious Ie’Et.s, rights, and pi-ayers on the two berths, the light-
weight and the welterweight.

In the lightweight class, it was generally figured that Jimmy
Giannatti would be handed the summons. However, it has been so
hard to convince a gent by the name of Abe Konick of the fact, that
a real fight is in progress for this post. Konick is more of a two-
fisted fighter than Giannatti, and also possesses some of the polish
that goes with the 135-pound class. Giannatti has not lost any of the
skill that carried him to the finals of the last conference champion-
ships in his weight, and, in addition, has developed a better punch
than he had last season. Having these two men out for this posi-
tion makes it definitely certain that the Panthers will be well rep-
resented in this division.

Bernie Spiegel and Billy Aines are both closing in on the we‘terweight
berth. Spiegel, who held the position last season, is handicapped by a sched-
ule that calls for most of his daylight hours, and still lacks quite a few
pounds that welterweighes are allowed. Ames, however, lacks Spiegel’s ex-
perience, although having a reach and weight. adventage. It should be
quite interesting when these two boys tangle.

Mat Hounds

Now that Dr. Sutherland has returned from a hunting trip, interest in
wrestling should reach a new all-time high. Undoubtedly the magic name
of Sutherland will do wonders in attracting prospective candidates. At least
twenty mat candidates have been studiously working themselves into the

proper frame of mind and body for the coming season, and the three matches
already scheduled. 
One thing quite noticeable while watching wrestlers drill, is the
fact that every man is a self-appointed coach of the game. It seems
odd to see the winning wrester stop and explain to the loser just
how he happens to be winning and how to block his attempts in
case he tries the same holds again. Which is all well and good!
Schedules
The mere fact that any athlete would actually ask for more work is dis-
concerting to say the least. This astounding phenomenon has actually taken
place among the boxers who have become aware» of the fact that the schedule
calls for ﬁve matches during the three months of the season. However, the
rumor has arisen that one of the scheduled teams may drop the sport for
the year and thus reduce the Pitt schedule to four matches in three months.
In case this actually happened, this corner believes that interest in the
sport would lessen materially because of the small schedule and the large

Revamped Track
House In Order
For Next Season

Strong Rivalry Already Shown
In Battle For Mile-Relay
Berths In Practice

I
very ﬁrst day that classes reconvene
Coach Olson will issue a call for in-
door track candidates and then work
will begin in earnest, with the hours
at the track house being from one to
six o’clock every day. This makes it
possible for a fellow with any kind of
a schedule to work in a session every
afternoon.

A feature of the coming season will
be the holding of weekly handicap
meets, an innovation designed pri-
marily for novices. Adding to this
the annual intra-mural meet and the
varsity and freshman schedules, a
very busy indoor track season looms,
in the offing.

Although the opening appearance of
the indoor track team, scheduled for
February 10 at the West Virginia re-
lays, is almost two months off, prepa-
rations are already being made for

what is expected to be the most suc-
cessful campaign of this sport in re-
cent years,

Foremost among the preparations
has been the reconditioning of the
track house, the building adjacent to
the football practice ﬁeld. The addi-
tion of several coats of Paint and
clearing away several obstructing
posts and antiquated materials has.
worked wonders with the home of thei
winter trackmen. The locker room

Cagers Play Two
During Vacation

Meet Minnesota, Ohio State In
Christmas Week

While most of us are preparing for
a two-weeks’ vacation, the Pitt bas-
ketball team will ﬁnd its recess some-
what curtailed by two very important
cage games scheduled for Christmas
week.

The ﬁrst encounter will ﬁnd Pitt
stacking up against the quintet from
Minnesota. Even though a Panther
victory on the basketball court will
hardly atone for the defeat the local
gridders suffered at the hands of
these same Minnesotans, a win for the
Golden Cats will be none the less
sweet. This game will get under way
at 8:25 o’clock on Wednesday, Decem-
ber 27.

Three days later, on Saturday, De-

cember 30, the Ohio State basketball
team will invade the Stadium ﬂoor to
test the strength of the Panthers.
Buckeye basketball teams are always
a power in the Big Ten conference
and ought to provide some very stren-
uous opposition for the locals.

This will make the fourth Big Ten

team which the Panthers have met ,

this season. It is expected that the
week’s layoff‘ after the tough mid-
western trip will find the Pitt boys in
good shape and all hands ready to go.

Tastes Victory,
Defeat on Trip

Nose 0111: Northwestern After
Losing Hard - Fought Game
To Purdue On Friday

After registering an even split in
the ﬁrst two games of their mid-
western trip, the Pitt basketball team,
Coach Carlson, and student manager
Wettach were due to arrive in Pitts-
burgh early this morning.

The Panthers obtained revenge for
the 31-22 loss meted out to them by
the Northwestern team last season by

a close 27-23 score Saturday night at
Chicago. Friday night’s game found
the local boys on the -short end of a
33-27 count in the game with Purdue
at Lafayette, Both games were
marked by their roughness, due prin-
cipally to the

stars
Panthers. A total of 25 personal
fouls were called in the Purdue game
and a slightly higher number appeared
in the Northwestern encounter;

The Panthers gave Purdue a hard
struggle all the way through the ﬁrst
half and for the better part of the sec-
ond, but the Boilermakers’ reserve pow-
er wasn't quite matched by the home
lads and therein lies the story of the
defeat. It was Claire Cribbs who
kept the Panthers in the running for
most of the game. The tall center
rolled in four pretty. baskets when
Pitt needed them most. Not far be-
hind in the scoring totals were Don
McCamant and Skip Hughes who both
accounted for seven points. -Collom,
Purdue forward, was the high-scorer
of the evening, his three ﬁeld goals

Pitt News Sports Editor

Columbia/s Chances

About all the football experts in the
country have agreed that when Co-
lumbia and Stanford clash in the Rose
Bowl game New Year’s Day at Pasa-
dena, the California players will run
up about as large a score as they
choose. However, there is a minority
which believe that Lou Littlels team
not only will hoid the score down
but may in fact win the game,

The latter base their View on sever-
al facts. First, they point to the fact
that Stanford in all probability, will
be highly over-conﬁdent. Sports writ-
ers all over the country are laughing
out loud over the selection of Colum-
bia as the best team in the East. The
Stanford boys not being blind and be-
ing able to read, are assimilating all
this so called expert opinion and the
not, if they are like other football
players, ignoring it.

The Columbia players will not be
over confident. They will be out to
show the football world that they
compose one of the strongest teams in
the country and that they are a
worthy representatives of the East.
It is this attitude that sometimes

transforms a mediocre team into a
team that just won’t be beaten.

Then there are quite a few people
who do not believe that the Stanford
liidians are the best team on the Pa-
ciﬁc Coast. They are the ones who
do not believe that there is any team
in the country better than the South-

to the fact that most of the sports
writers on the Coast declared izhat the
Trolans were very much “o1"1”’ tiie
day they met Tiny Tliornhil1’s team
and that Stanford was beaten by
Washiiigmn, a team whicr did not cut
very much of a ﬁgure in the Paciﬁc
Coast Conference.

However, there’s no denying the fact
that the Indians did defeat the Cali-
f01‘Hia Bears :1. team which scored
m01‘€ Of eV€1")’tliiug but points against
Southern California.

The Indians should win, However,
should they go into the game very
much overconﬂdent, Cliff Montgomery
and his mates may give the football
world quite a little shock.

Sellouts

There should certainly be at least
three sell outs at the Stadium next
football season. VVe refer to the
Pitt-Minnesota, the Pitt-Notre Dame,
and the Pitt-Southern California
games.

Minnesota, the only team to defeat
the Paiitliers this year, lose only one
regular through graduation. He is
Captain Ray Oien one of the best cen-
ters in the country. Next year they
have with them among others, Liind,
Larson. and Alfonse, three of the best
players the Pitt team faced all year.

The Pitt-Notre Dame game has
been made doubly attractive by the
fact that Elmer Layden is now head
coach at the South Bend school.

Southern California, whom every
Pitt student feels to be the enemy of
all mankind, is what is called a “natu-
ral.” With Scooter VVarburton, the
most brilliant individual football play-
er in the country today as one of its
stars, the Southern Calfornia team

Ch To Sing Like The Seniors
Sing!---Sing Co-Eds At Sing

 

Freshmen ’n’ Sophomores ’n’ Juniors ’n’ Seniors Outsing
Each Other For Singing’_s Sake

 

The class of 1934 now owns a per-
manent trophy. For the third time
they have won the interclass sing.
the custom they began when they
were sophomores. They found it a
hard ﬁght, as the other three women’s
classes were all equally determined
to carry off the cup. Last Friday, at
12:30 o’clock the bleachers that had
been‘ temporarily built in Heinz House
were packed with the 450 women all
cheering for their respective classes.

The presidents of the four classes
drew for places; the seniors drew
ﬁrst; juniors, second; freshmen,
third, and sophomores- fourth.

In keeping with their soon-to-be-ac-
quired academic dress, the ﬁrst four
,rows of the senior section- wore caps
and gowns: nightcaps and nightgowns.
They greeted Florence Price with the
traditional hello song, “Good morning
to you, dear chancellor,” and one en-
terprising senior gave a highly pol-
ished apple. The songs took the
class through their four years in the
University, and their various states
of knowledge during those years. As
they ﬁnished their part of the sing,
they threw down the senior ball, ex-
pressing their regret at leaving. Bet-
ty Quarrie was chairman for the class.

The juniors greeted the judges and
the other three classes with .‘.‘How do
you do: worthy judges; snobblsh sen-
iors; giddy sophomores; and lowly
freshmen.” They gave their opinion,
in‘ song, of the various world prob-
lems: the depression, NRLA, Russia,
Japan, and even Pittsburgh. As their
ﬁnish, the class formed the letter J
in their cheering section of the
bleachers. Frances Dent was chair-
man.

A feature offered by the freshman
class was a tap dance by Mary Jo

The freshmen had the largest turn-
out; their section of the bleachers
was packed and there was an over-
ﬂow into the sophomore section. Vir-
ginia Boyd, chairman, led the group.

The sophomores passed on a new
mascot to the freshmenga jester. Car-
olyn El-l"all, chairman, was arrayed in
the brilliant motley of a court jester,
and introduced the various persons
in the skits. Ruth Sochatoff was Fred-
dy the Freshman, and Frances Good-
win, Sophie the Sophomore. Mar-
garet Lewis, Ruth DeForest and Doro-
thy Kaufman were the three little
pigs representing the other classes.

The judges were: Dean Armbrus-
ter, Dr. Elmer, Dr. Geise, Dr. Wil-
liams, Dr. Witz, and Mr. Cass. Dr.
Williams acted as chairman, and an-
nounced the winner.

Pitt Students Take Part

News Consensus Of All-American Teams Awards End Berth To Skladany

 

A
V

Bernard, Michigan Center, Is Unanimous Choice On Star
Teams Compiled By Outstanding Papers And
Authorities On Gridiron Events

Buckler And Feathers'

Lead In Balloting
For Halfbacks

Perhaps an All-America team hav-
ing more justiﬁcation than any other
that could be chosen, would be a
‘Consensus All-America team, made up
of the players picked on All-American
teams chosen by leading football
authorities. Little chance for a cry of
favoritism should be leveled at the
selection of any player on such an
eleven.

Our choice for the leading All-Amer-
ica football teams includes the ones
chosen by the New York World Tele-
gram, the Associated Press, the News-
paper Enterprise Association, the New
York Post, the New York Sun, the
United Press, the International News
Service, Central Press, Hearst, Parke
H. Davis, and the Christy Walsh All-
American Board.

Bernard, Michigan center, is the
only player throughout the country to
be chosen on all the above mentioned
All-American teams.

Corbus, Stanford's great guard, was
chosen on every All-American team
but the United Press. Pitt's Joe
Skladany and Irvine Warburton, of
Southern California, missed out on
only two teams. Skladany was not
chosen on the New York Post team or
on the United Press. Neither the
World Telegram nor the Parke Davis
teams included Warburton.

Rosenberg, Southern California
guard, Buckler, Army halfback, and
Feathers, Tennessee halfback, were
chosen on eight of the eleven teams
on our list,

The Consensus All-America team
would be made up of Skladany at one
end, and either Larson, of Minnesota,
or Geisler, of Centenary, at the other
end. Each of the latter two received
three votes. Matal, of Columbia,
Smith, of Washington, and Petosky, of
Michigan, received two votes apiece.

Crawford, of Duke, with seven
votes, and Wistert, of Michigan with
ﬁve, are the tackles on the All—Con-
sensus team, Schwa.mmel, of Iowa,
and Ceppi, of Princeton, each received
four votes for the tackle positions.

Corbus, of Stanford, and Rosenberg,
of Southern California, are at the
guards. No one was even close to
these two.

Bernard, of course, was the unani-
mous choice for center.

Warburton received all the votes
but two for the quarterback position.
Montgomery, of Columbia, was select-
ed on the Pa.rke H. Davis team, and
Johnson, of Army, was chosen on the
World Telegram eleven.

Buckler, of Army, and Feathers, of
Tennessee, are the halfbacks. Pug
Lund, with ﬁve votes, is their nearest
competitor.

Sauer, of Nebraska, with ﬁve votes
is the fullback on the Consensus All-
American team.

Alpha Kappa Psi
Speakers Named

 

 

Chairman Ammerman Announces
Four Month Schedule

Robert K, Ammerman, chairman of
the program committee, announced
this week the schedule of speakers
who will address Alpha Kappa
Psi, professional business administra-
tion fraternity, at its regular monthly
meeting in the Fort Pitt hotel (luring
the next four months.

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, head of the
political science department, will
speak at 9:30 o’clock next Monday,
Ammerman said. The remaining
speakers are Lieutenant-Colonel Ed-
ward J. Cullen, head of the military
department, January 8; Dr. Alfred E.
Wolf, associate professor of zoology,
February 5; Dr. Andrey A. Avinoﬁ,
assistant professor of ﬁne arts, Feb-
ruary 26; Dr. Ralph E. Turner, asso-
ciate professor of history, March 16;
and Dr, M, (3_ Elmer, head of the de-
partment of sociology, April 2.

The policy of having speakers on
subjects not concerning business has
been adopted, said Robert C. Dren-
nen, president of the fraternity, be-
cause the members feel the meetings
have thus far been too closely re-
lated to one ﬁeld.

anxious to go home westward for
Christmas can get a ride as far

department of the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing com-
pany, will leave either tomorrow

Swimming Squad
Continues Drills
Individuals To Keep In Shape By
Swimming Every Day

After three months of swimming
practice the team will be given a lay-
off over the Christmas vacation. This

does not mean that the swimmers will
quit swimming altogether over the re-
cess, but that there will be no more
practice until after the holidays.

Coach »Corr need not worry about a
number of individual team members
not getting enough practice on their
own account. Jack Hanna and Joe
Jones intend to work out daily in the
Canton YM-CA pool. Russell Lind-
berg and Herman Adlersberg will do
plenty of swimming in the Homestead
Library tank. Adlersberg, who has a
liking for individual training, plans to
swim a lot of breaststroke. Charles
Chambers and Willard Norton will
get a chance to practice sprints in the
75-foot pool at Keystone Athletic club.
John Carik, a diver, Jack Denny, Wil-
liam Lewis, and Joseph Madden, free-
style specialists, and William ‘Swazuk,
backstroker, will also keep in shape
by taking daily work outs at the Key-
stone pool.

William Ruhe will swim in his
home town pool in Lancaster, Pennsyl-
vania. Harry Wagner, a diver, will
put in plenty of hours of practice per-
fecting a do-uble gainor at the Webster
Hall pool. Paul Stinner, a good 50-
yard man, will practice starts and
turns, a factor in winning 50-yard
races in the Duquesne Library pool.
Joseph Schmeiler and Harry Geyer,
one of the freshman swimmers, will
practice in the Carrick YMCA pool.

Third Lacrosse
Contest Tonight

Buffalo Meets Pittsburgh Team
At Motor Square Garden

The third game of the local sea-
son will be played tonight at the Mo-
tor Square Garden with Pittsburgh
being opposed by the formidable Buf-
falo club.

This game brings together two of
the strongest teams in the Lacrosse
League with the top position in league
standing going to the winner of to-
night’s tilt. Pittsburgh, with impres-
sive wins over Milwaukee and Toron-
to in its ﬁrst two games, will have its
ﬁrst real test in tonight’s battle.

Buffalo is an all-Indian team, with
the best Indian lacrosse players in the
world combining to make one of the
greatest aggregations of modern la-
crosse. Both teams are former mem-
bers of the old Canadian league and
all members of both clubs are natives
of Canada.

The renewal of an old rivalry be-
tween Deerfoor, Vanevery, Indian de-
fense star, and Llalfrance, Pittsburgh
center, will bring together two of

Ithe best players of the sport and is

sure to provide some spectacular la-
crosses for the customers.

After this game, Pittsburgh leaves
on its ﬁrst trip of the season, oppos-
ing Buffalo, Toronto, Chicago, Milwau-
kee, and Indianapolis, returning home
on New Year's day for the game with
Chicago.
