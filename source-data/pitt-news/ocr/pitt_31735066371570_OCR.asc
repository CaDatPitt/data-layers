Social work research team

By Marty Wlllls
Senior Editor

What is the proper role of univer-
sity researchers who study the eco-
nomic and political lives of troubled
communities in “the outside world?"

According to an eight-person
research team from Pitt's School of
Social Work, it is possible —— indeed,
often desirable — for scholars to do
more than simply develop theories
and amass knowledge for its own
sake. Professors and students can
work to improve society rather than
merely to understand it, the team
says.

With this goal in mind, social
work professor James Cunningham
and seven graduate students from
his Organizational Behavior and
Analysis course set out last October
to study the economically depressed
Beaver County town of Alliquippa
— and to make recommendations
for the community's future.

The team’s 102-page report, “Alli-
quippa: Struggle for Survival in a
Pittsburgh Milltown, i984 and
Before,“ released earlier this month,
concludes that organizations and
institutions in the area should coa-
lesce into a single development coa-
lition for Alliquippa, Cunningham
said.

When approaching outside agen-
cies, banks and other institutions for
help, he said, “the community needs
to begin speaking with one voice,
with one plan.“ Because ofdifferen-
ces and squabbling within the town's
leadership circles, Cunningham said
this idea has never been given a
chance to work in Alliquippa, where
the local Jones and Laughlin_ Steel
plant is still the top employer despite

widespread layoffs in recent years.

An entire community can be “dev-
astated" by high unemployment, the

professor said. “It just ripples
through the whole community.
Household income drops so rapidly
that it tends to jeopardize the life of
the entire community.“

Moreover, certain types of crime
tend to increase when employment
and earnings decrease significantly,
he said. Shoplifting, armed robbery,
assault and drug trafficking specifi-
cally are on the rise in Alliquippa,
according to the report.

“There are a large number of
manufacturing communities that
are suffering in the same kind of
way," Cunningham said. He cited
such nearby towns as Ambridge,
Homestead, Braddock, Mcl(eesport

“The community
needs to begin
speaking with one
voice

—J. Cunningham

and Duquesne as examples of

municipalities hit hard by the
decline of the American steel
industry.

Cunningham said “there are a lot
of things available to a town like
[Alliquippa] that can help matters
out. But as long as they’re fighting
each other down there, with the
blacks and whites ﬁghting, they're
not going to get anywhere." To sur-
vive the current economic crisis, he
said Alliquippans will need to bury
their differences.

The driving force behind a new
organizing effort designed to bring
reconciliation and unity to Alli-
quippa is 32-year-old Cathy Cairns,
a member of the research team and

one of Cunningham's students in
Pitt's M.S.W. program.

Cairns, a resident of Center
Township in Beaver County, is now
doing her internship in community
organizing. She is already well on
the way to organizing a new entity
comprising representatives of
borough government, social service
agencies, hospitals and other leading
institutions in Alliquippa.

The coalition is scheduled to hold
its second meeting tomorrow, and
deciding on a name for itself is
among the items on the agenda,
Cairns said yesterday. At the intro-
ductory meeting two weeks ago, 27
community leaders showed up to
explore their options for working
together to revive Alliquippa, she
said. ‘

“Everybody committed person-
ally to working together for at least a
year," Cairns reported. A priority
committee meeting of seven people
was held last Thursday, and three
specific projects were identified as
starting points for the coalition.

The first project will be an imme-
diate effort to back the local steel-
workers‘ union in ongoing
negotiations with Jones and Laugh-
lin, which has announced it will
close part ofits Alliquippa works or
its Youngstown, Ohio, works.
About 500 jobs-are at stake in each
city, and only one city will manage
to escape the proposed layoffs,
Cairns said.

Other efforts will include a project
to improve Alliquippa’s image and
an economic development program
intended to put small businesses in
communication with agencies that
provide grants for business ventures.

The other graduate students on
the research team are Elizabeth
Blocher, Matthew Hawkins, Robina
Linear, Celestine Robb, Charyl
Trotter and Joseph Witherspoon.

Grading standards determined by profs

By Tim Hunter
Staff Writer

Many Pitt students have ques-
tioned the fairness ofthe ﬁnal grades
they have received at the end of a
semester. There are, in fact, no
standard criteria within Pitt's indi-
vidual departments that dictates
grading standards for students,
according to Pitt faculty and
administrators.

“Under the guideline of academic
freedom, the [chemistry] depart-
ment encourages the individual pro-
fessor to establish their own grading
criteria," said W. Richard Howe,
assistant chairman of Pitt’s chemis-
try department.

“The chemistry department
administration does not interfere
with grading policies of individual
professors unless there is an appar-
ent abuse brought to our attention
by individual students."

Howe explained that in situations
of abuse of grading policies, the
departmental administrators would
discuss the policy with the particular
professor. They would propose an
alternate method that might be used
to guarantee protection for the stu-
dents under the accepted academic
guidelines.

“However, it is important that we

. . . . — . . . . . . . . . . . a s . . - . . o n A 4 L A

do not and would not forcea profes-
sor to change a particular grade,"
Howe said. “Grades are assigned
strictly on the bases ofthe individual
instructors prerogative."

There are some exceptions. Indi-
vidual instructors sometimes con-
trol grades. This is common among
such introductory courses as Basic
Writing offered by the English
department.

“The standards for what grades
the student receives will be for the
most part up to the instructor,“ said
William Smith, associate professor
of English. “For certain courses such
as Basic Writing, there is a depart-
mental standard.

“For that course, there is a man-
datory final exam which isjudged by
the department."

According to Howe, the profes-
sors who teach the General Chemis-
try courses also try to maintain some
standard grading practices among
the sections in which the course is
taught.

The physics department is one of
the few departments where an actual
recommendation is made on how
professors should set their grading
criteria in advance courses.

“In upper level classes or those
aimed at physics majors, the recom-
mendations made to the professors
are bases on absolute standards,"
said Allen Janis. professor in the

A n u n n noeniouonuonlu n Anat-

physics department. "What I mean
by absolute standards is based upon
the student's promise for success in
physics. For example, to graduate as
a physics major a student must
maintain a “C" average in the
required physics courses.

Janis explained that an “A" in the
physics department means the stu-
dent would be a good candidate of
for graduate school. A “B" means
the student is prepared for graduate
school criteria and a “C" means the
student can graduate with an under-
graduate degree, but is not qualified
for graduate school.

“This understanding of what a
grade means is recommended to the
professors as a standard for setting
their own grading policies," Janis
said.

According to James Terwilliger,
author of the book “Assigning
Grades to Students," there are basi-
cally three approaches a professor
may use for assigning grades to
students.

He calls the first the “curve,"
which is used when the professor
assigns grades based on the assump-
tion of a normal distribution of
scores among all students. The pro-
fessor using this type of system
assigns an “A" grade only to those
students receiving 90 percent or bet-
ter on tests, a “B“ to those between
80 percent and 90 percent, a “C“ to

o n - - ~ A n-qaosucaonn-coon I

those between 70 percent and 80 per-
cent a “D" to those between 60 per-
cent and 70 percent and an “F” to
those below 60 percent on test
scores.

“Although standardized tests
[such as SATs] are typically con-
structed to give normal distribu-
tions, teacher-made tests rarely are
so designed,” Terwilliger explained
in the book. “Another problem is
class sizes are typically too small to
expect a normal distribution.”

Terwilliger‘s second grading
approach consists of abandoning
the normal curve model and simply
using the students in the class as a
reference group.

“This implies that the perfor-
mance of each student should be
judged in the contest of other
members of the class with no
assumption made regarding the
form which the total score distribu-
tion should take,“ Terwilliger wrote.

According to Terwillger, the
major problem with this approach is
classes are often so small that sub-
stantial differences in the mean and
standard deviation may arise form
class to class.

“Such sampling error can have an
appreciable effect on the assignment
of grades unless the norm group is
fairly large, [for example], I50 to
200," he wrote.

The third approach for an instruc-

n . s A A - a o n A I o

tor is the formation of a norm group
by combining scores for several dif-
ferent classes. The classes combined
may be either different sections of
the same course taught in a particu-
lar year of classes in the same subject
in successive years.

“By increasing the size of the
norm group," said Terwilliger, “the
effects of sampling error can be sub-
stantially reduced."

Graduate schools are one of the
parties most concerned about grad-
ing criteria.

“Over a period of time, both
departments and the admissions
office become familiar with different
grading policies in different schools
around the country,“ said Herbert
Rubin, associate dean ofthe Faculty
of Arts and Sciences (FAS).

“in our office, we take this into
account, admitting those students
coming from schools with stringent
grading criteria and their QPA a lit-
tle below 3.0 [minimal criterion for
admission with full status]; con-
versly, the department may insist on
significantly greater QPAs from
other students."

Herbert also said that his depart-
ment compensates for the variability
in grading standards by examining
other credentials including stand-
ardized test scores, letters of recom-
mendation and transcripts.

Letter to the Editor

Critic lashes columnis’r’s
nuclear survival scheme

Maurice A. Mallin states in his
column of July II that defense
against a nuclear attack can be con-
templated by ‘“stargazing.“ One
must wonder which hallucinogenic
drug Mr. Mallin had consumed
before his contemplating these cos-
mic thoughts, for his insipid advo-
cacy of a space- and ground-based
ballistic missile defense (B.M.D.)
can only be the product of a drug-

: related experience or a complete

ignorance of deterrence theory and
contemporary foreign-affairs.

Mr. Mallin decries mutual
assured destruction (M.A.D.), whe-
rein both the American and Soviet
populations are held in hostage, for
its “immorality.” Instead of MAD,
Mr. Mallin proposes a shift to mut-
ual assured destruction (M.A.S.)
through the development of a
B.M.D. Now, what in H.E;L.L. is
that? Certainly, anyone with an ade-
quate understanding of nuclear
weaponry would realize that
“assured survival" remains a uto-
pian fantasy as long as both super-
powers possess cruise missiles and
SLBMs.

Mr. Mallin advocates, in effect,
the so-called “High Frontier," a
three-layered defense network.
Since the High Frontieris nominally
a defensive system, it should not
unduly alarm the Soviets about a
potential American first strike.

But the comprehensive High
Frontier proposal is a costly exercise
in self-deception. Its foundation
rests upon a fantastic belief that def-
ensive improvements will overcome
the hitherto insurmountable advan-
tages of offensive weaponry.

While Mr. Mallin depicts the
wonders of this system, he carelessly
neglects to examine the effectiveness
of the component parts of the sys-
tem. Had Mr. Mallin done so, he
could easily have answered his own
question: “Why Not?"

The High Frontier requires a
boost, mid-point and terminal
defense, and the initial boost stage is
the cornerstone of the entire system.
Failure at the boost stage practically
ensures failure at the other stages,
for the number of objects to count,
track and destroy, including the
decoys and chaff, is far too compli-
cated for contemporary defensive
technology.

Moreover, the space-based com-
ponent is vulnerable to [9705 ASAT
technology, and the Soviet Union
could easily develop further devices
to thwart the American satellites,
such as placing “space mines“ next

. to the satellites.

Further countermeasures by the
Soviet Union would present addi-

' tional obstacles to the system. The

Soviets could employ several rela-

tively inexpensive, yet effective,
measures against the High Frontier.
Such innovations could consist of
attaching "skirts” or other decoys,
which would confuse the space-
based sensors, to their missiles or
saturating the system with an
increased number of warheads. The
Soviet leadership could be expected
to violate the IO-warhead limita-
tions imposed by SALT; the Soviet
SS-I8 can carry 30 warheads.
Thus, the continued effectiveness
of offensive weaponry means that a
successful missile defense will not
materialize. The following example
should illustrate this fact: even if a
High Frontier network were to oper-
ate at 99.2 percent effectiveness

against a Soviet onslaught of l0,000 A

warheads, 80 of the warheads would
strike the United States. That is fail-
ure. A similar attack that is 5 percent
effective would destroy half the

American population. That is
success?
In reality, the High Frontier

would be extremely destabilizing
because it would be, in effect,
another offensive attack system,
particularly its space-based compo-
nent. The only sensible and feasible
alternative would be the construc-
tion of a ballistic missile point
defense with a concomitant reduc-
tion of offensive weaponry by both
sides. This would lessen the chance
of either side’s contemplating a first
strike.

Instead, Mr. Mallin would have
the United States base its strategic
policies on a scheme fraught with
uncertainty. Add Mr. Mallin to the
list of mountebanks who utter non-
sense on this subject for the purpose
of making themselves heard and
absurd as well.

Before the dawn/Adam Elsenstat

College only churns out
better-paid consumers

Ideally, colleges and universities
should be in the business ofdevelop-
ing intelligent and critical minds.
But because there really is no market
for intelligent and critical minds
today, the university’s function has
been drastically altered. Large uni-
versities like Pitt now exist mainly to
churn out professionals whose high
earning potential will enable them to
fit smugly into an economy based on
material acquisition and
consumption.

One need only observe the dozens
of credit-card application displays
plastered all over the campus to be
reminded of what a commercial
enterprise education has become. Of
course, the trappings ofsuch archaic
disciplines as philosophy and litera-
ture still exist.

And, of course, several classes in
these impractical, unmarketable dis-
ciplines are requirements for most
college students, regardless of their
majors. But this farce, underscored
by these ever-increasing and diverse
requirements, only serves to trivial-
ize the so-called liberal arts.

The very fact that each and every
student in such schools as the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences is required
to take a broad distribution of stud-

ies may indeed be a principal reason
for the stagnation of the liberal arts.

The social sciences at Pitt provide
a good example of the debilitating
eiiect or such requirements. Lower-
level social science courses are, in
both form and content, geared to the
degree-seeker who only wants his
nine credits of social sciences so he
can pursue the practical side of his
stay in college. These classes are reg-
ularly taught to I00-300 people at a
time, few of whom have any interest
in the class outside of a final grade.
This is not the way to learn anything.

The content of these “survey"
courses is generally so superficial
and bland that only the most inquisi-
tive and knowledge-hungry student
will pursue the subject matter in any
depth outside the classroom. How
many thousands of students have
passed through the same generic
courses at Pitt, able to parrot a few
key terms or concepts but unable to
evaluate their significance to con-
temporary society and. more impor-
tantly, to their own lives?

These classes, which are modeled
after and closely parallel the
assembly-line method of produc-
tion, are little more than insipid

 

exercises in force feeding —
“required knowledge,” uninspiring
to students and teachers alike. An
education must inspire and stimu-
late ~— or it is mere academic postur-
ing, unworthy of the term
“education.“

Abandoning distribution-of-
studies requirements for undergrad-
uates may not be the way to reverse
this slide into academic sterility. but
if administrators and other empow-
ered to mold curricula would jetti-
son their pretensions ot reviving the
outdated ideal of the eclectic,
broadly educated student, it would
be a step in the right direction.

Those who go to college for the
sole purpose of quickly acquiring a
good job after graduation so they
can languish in material comfort
should be able to pursue this goal
without interfering with real educa-
tion. And those who want more
from school than a lucrative set of
credentials should also be free to
pursue an optimal education.

As it stands now, with the two
dissimilar student types mixing

quite often in the same classes, this
optimal education is being denied to
many Pitt undergraduates.

Democratic Party chooses poor leaders

It's ﬁnally over. All of the frivo-
lous Democrats have left the town of
San Francisco with visions of the
presidency dancing in their heads.

I his past week at the 1984 Demo-
cratic national convention, the don-
keys have chosen their candidate for
the office of president. This man is
supposed to lead the most powerful
nation in the world. This man's
name? No, it's not Jimmy; it's Fritz.

The Democratic Party has once
again chosen as their leader a person
who is not capable of leading.

Fritz has been led throughout his
political career by two people. First
there was Hubert Humphrey, to
whom Fritz was, oh, most loyal.
According to The New York Times,
this loyalty greatly influenced Fritz’
views on Vietnam: “In the late 1960s,
Mr. Mondale was one of the few
liberals to defend President John-
son's conduct on the Vietnam War,
largely because Mr. Humphrey was
vice president. Mr. Mondale
changed his views only in 1969,
when Richard M. Nixon was in the
White House."

We may never know what Fritz
actual views on Vietnam were; he
was either loyal to one person or
opposing another. What their views
were didn't seem to matter.

Fritz‘ views was former President
Jimmy Carter. During the 1980
primary campaign, “Mr. Mondale
accused Mr. [Edward] Kennedy
Iwho had just praised Mondale at
the convention] of playing ‘the poli-
tics of the moment’ by opposing the
restriction on grain exports to the
Soviet Union. After the election, it
was disclosed that Mr. Mondale
himself had argued against the grain
curb in the Carter administration,”
The New York Times reported.

It seems as though, in the hands of
Jimmy Carter, Fritz was the one
who was playing “the politics of the
moment.”

Of course, there was a period of
time when Fritz had neither Hubert
nor Jimmy to lead him. During this
time, he had to function as a senator
by himself, a senator without any
highlights of great leadership.
“Senate critics said Mr. Mondale’s
12-year career in the Senate was rel-
atively modest, although others said
he played key roles on such issues as
open housing and busing to acheive
racial integration, Nonetheless, no
major legislation bore the Mondale
name," the Times reported last
Thursday.

As a senator, he was “modest,"
but as a vice president, he was even
worse. Newsweek best describes

‘ and women. Actually, Fritz’ choice

   

 

 
      

Fritz’ vice presidential years: “From
the beginning, Mondale was praised
as the most powerful vice president
in history, with an office in the West
wing of the White House, regular
Monday lunches with Carter and
access to every piece of paper going
to the president  But as Carter’s
fortunes began to sour, a new ques-
tion began to be raised in political
circles: exactly what was Mondale
doing with his unparalleled access
and power?”

Newsweek says the answer to this
question, according to many people
who worked in Carter‘s administra-
tion, is “virtually nothing —— except
counsel caution and defend the
interests of various Democratic con-
stituency groups." One Carter aide
essentially reduced Fritz to a ves-
man for the Carter adminsitration:
“ ‘At meetings,’ a Carter aide recalls,
‘Mondale would always speak last
and wait for the consensus to
develop,’ " reported Newsweek.

Fritz‘ vice presidential years bring
to mind another sour note from last
week's convention — Geraldine Fer-
raro, the first woman to run for vice
president on a major party’s ticket.
The choice of a woman as a running
mate is supposedly a major step up

is a step down. He is patronizing
women by assuming they will vote
for him because his running mate is a
woman —— and not because she is
unusually qualified for the job.
“Her lack of national experience,
especially in foreign policy, offers a
target to Republicans, who will con-
trast it with the impressive resume of
Vice President George Bush," News-
week reported. As a person, not as a
woman, Geraldine Ferraro is most
unqualified, especially when com-
pared to Bush. -
On the other hand, Ferraro is
rather similar to Fritz. That is to say,
she, too, compromises her strong
values in the interest of politics. She
claims she is a Catholic, yet she feels
it‘s all right for women to have abor-
tions. In Newsweek, she states, “I
have been blessed with the gift of
faith, but others have not. I have no
right to impose my beliefs on them."
The Catholic Church considers
abortion an act of murder. If Fer-
raro truly has “been blessed with the
gift of faith," she also must believe,
as a Catholic, that abortion is
murder. A vice president who feels
other people are allowed to commit
murder by having abortions is
totally unacceptable.

babies killed; that is about I4 million
more deaths than all of those result-
ing from every war in which the Uni-
ted States has been involved from
the Revolutionary War to Vietnam.
The argument that legalization of
abortion does not increase the
number of abortions just doesn't
hold water. It's very hard to imagine
how Ferraro can so easily comprom-
ise her values in the interest of poli-
ties on such a grave subject as abor-
tinn.

While these Democrats were com-
promising their values within the
house called Moscone Center in San
Francisco, other Democrats were
compromising theirs in the House in
Washington, D.C. — for political
reasons. no less.

Dan Rostenkowski (D-lll.), chair-
man of the House Ways and Means
Committee, has influenced the
Democratic-controlled House to
refuse the approval of President
Reagan's Enterprise Zone Program,
according to John Denny, a member
of Allegheny County's Republican
Executive Committee. This pro-
gram would give businesses federal,
state and local tax breaks and other
incentives to provide new invest-
ments and jobs in economically
depressed areas.

“A study done by the Sabre Foun-
dation found that state and local tax
incentives had already been respon-
sible for either creating or saving
more than 20,000jobs in designated
zone areas," Denny said.

Our nation already has a
Democratic-controlled Congress
that plays political games with eco-
nomically depressed areas. We can't
afford a president and vice president
who also play those games, espe-
cially a president who only feels
comfortable when led by others.

Last week's Democratic conven-
tion had many notable speakers.
However, while watching Fritz
flounder about behind the micro-
phone trying to lead the Democratic
Party. a foregone conclusion came
to mind -— Ronald Reagan will
remain in the White House.

PURPLE RAIN
Prince and the Revolution
Warner Bros.

It doesn’t seem right. A guy
should have burned out already
when he‘s put out six records by
his early 20s. But the Minneapo-
lis wunderkind has done it again.

Prince first scored in'the late
70s with the dance hit “I Wanna
Be Your Lover” and went on to
explode the barrier between
black and white music with a
sound often described as
“punkfunk.”

His broad appeal was given
momentum by the wildly erotic
content of his songs and concert
performances, culminating in
last year’s tour in which Prince
sodomized a huge bed rising out
of the stage amidst swirling fog.
The man knows how to market
himself.

This Friday, in 700 theaters
across the country, Prince’s first
feature film will be released. Pur-
ple Rain, the movie, costs $7 mil-
lion with Prince footing the bill,
and opening himself up to
storms of criticism for such a
blatantly self-indulgent venture.
Advance word, however, has
been overwhelmingly positive.

     

For Purple Rain, the sound-
track, Prince uses his band for
the first time. In the past, he has
composed, sung. and played all

the instruments --— an lmpreg-
s1vc.. but ultimately limiting
practice.

The record opens with a call to
worship, to celebrate “this thing
called life.” As the church organ
fades, the insistent thump of
“Let’s Go Crazy" asserts itself,
an emotional, jubilant demand
to live for the present.

This transition is the whole
album in microcosm. Musically,

2-Entertainment

Prince takes us through wild
careening shifts from gospel to
psychedelia to funk to jazz. It
seems unpolished, almost out of
control, but excitingly urgent
with guitars and synthesizers
battling for dominance.

Lyrically, “Let’s Go Crazy”
espouses the same hedonism
Prince has been touting for
years. On other songs his vision
is more spiritual, his evangelism
more moving. In “I Would Die 4
U," he pleads, “l’m not a
human/ll am a dove/l am your
conscience/l am love. In
another, he proclaims, “Sing it
-~— We all a star.”

Prince is no longer happy with
just turning out a muscular
amalgam of rock and funk. Nor
is he content with an image that
is a parody of sexual androgyny,
the latest fad. For the first time,
Prince gives us a" piece of his
boundlessly creative soul  and
an album that will be remem-
bered long after the Jacksons’
tour.

BRAVE NEW GIRL

Bonnie Hayes and the Wild
Combo

Bondage Records

Two years have driven down
the pike since Good Clean Fun,
the brilliant debut disc from
Bonnie Hayes and the Wild
Combo. At last: Miss Hayes and
company are back on vinyl and
virtually intact, even if Brave
New Girl is only a six-cut mini
album. Most disturbing about
the package is the fact that the
band seems to have toned down
overall, but only slightly. The
material relies less on Bonnie’s
jazz roots and keyboard ability,
leaning more toward a rhythm-
and-guitar/ pop rock orientation
this time around.

Bonnie Hayes possesses one of
the more distinctive voices in the
business, comfortably and
equally at home prowling upbeat
territory or mining the slower
numbers. And the Combo w
fine musicians all; Hank Manin-
ger on bass, Paul Davis on
guitar, and new member Bill
Engel on guitar and guitar syn-
thesizer. Drummer (and
brother) Kevin Hayes offers
skillful and sympathetic support
on percussion.

Miss Hayes co-authored most
of the material with producer
Steve Savage; the songwriting is
strongiand consistent particu-
larly the lyrics. Good Clean Fun
and an immediate accessibility
and a party/carnival feel that

   

Brave New Girl lacks. Given
time, though, the new set reaches
out with hooks that hold on
tight.

Best bets: “Maria,” a mid-
tempo ballad with a sparse and
mostly rhythmic accompani-
ment; “Night Baseball," upbeat
and amusing; and the two that
center on Bonnie’s keyboards -
the rollicking “Incommunicado"
and “After Hours," a truly beau-
tiful ballad. “Wild Heart” ‘s vo-
cal arrangement helps it, and
there are some neat riffs to boot.
The weakest of the six? The title
track, still a respectable if unre-
markable pop composition.

The new album lacks some of 

the insistence of its predecessor,

but Brave New Girl is sturdy 
enough to remind us that Bonnie I
Hayes and the Wild Combo rank I

with the best ofthe newer crop of

recording artists. Nice to have 1
them back in circulation again, 
and isn't it time for their fame — 
considerable in home-base San 

Francisco - to spread?

THE MA

“When you become successful, you have to learn to cope with
success."

——Roger Kingdom

By Charlie O'Hara
Senior Editor

Roger Kingdom has coped quite well, quite often.

From his days at Vienna High School in Unadilla, Georgia, to his
years of track success at Pitt and with Pittsburgh‘s New Image Track
Club, Kingdom has dealt with plenty of success but it didn't happen
without some hardships.

It was a difficult transition to make, leaving the days of high school
glory behind and taking on the challenge of Division I football, and
Kingdom (6-l, I90) struggled through two frustrating seasons as a
running back and then as a defensive back.

“I was riding the pine [sitting on the bench]," he said. “I did it too
long. lt’s bad enough not playing, but you have to watch somebody
else while you're sitting — that's too much.”

It was then — January of I983 following Pitt's Cotton Bowl loss to
Southern Methodist — that he decided to give track a try.

The decision wasn't too difficult to understand.

‘K

In high school, he set state records in the discus(l64 feet), the high
jump (640%) and I l0-meter high hurdles (13.7) while sweeping the
same state titles as a junior and a senior.

He cleared that first ﬂight of hurdles during the indoor season at
the Eastman Kodak Invitational at East Tennessee State. In the
opening trial heat, Kingdom sprinted over 55—meters and ﬁve hurdles
in NCAA qualifying time — 7.2.

His interest in track had been rekindled.

He went on to win the most valuble performer award at the Big
East Indoor Championship in Syracuse, N.Y. and at the Virginia
Military lnstitute (VMI) Winter Relays.

However, at the NCAA championship meet, Kingdom was
bumped from his lane in the finals and his season ended with a lot of
question marks.

The outdoor season was a spectacular rebound from the cham-
pionship fiasco. After participating in the annual spring football
drills, Kingdom went back to the track.

The I l0-meter outdoor event is Kingdom's forte. Twice the dis-
tance of the indoor race, he is able to utilize his speed to race down
the quick starters who rule the indoor track.

He won the NCAA championship in June beating Tennessee's
heralded Willie Gault, was runnerup to Gault in a photo finish at the
National Sports Festival in July, and then won the Pan American
Games gold medal in August.

In September he made the decision to redshirt his junior football
season to train for the Olympics.

“I knew I wasn't gonna play because Tommy Flynn was there at

safety,” he said.

The 1983-84 indoor season arrived in December at George Mason
University and Kingdom opened with his personal best time in the
55-meter event — 7.02. It turned out to be the second fastest time by
anybody in the country during the season. Only the world’s top man,
Greg Foster, bettered Kingdom's effort.

Despite the season’s lightning fast start, the winter months
dragged on with frustration. But victories at the Big East indoor and
NCAA championship prepared him for what would be his greatest
challenge — making the Olympic team.

“Roger had a tough time during the indoor season,” said New
Image Track Club coach Elbert Kennedy. “He thought everybody
was against him.

“He was put in the outside lane for the TAC [Track Athletics
Congress] meet and he was really down about it. He thought they
didn‘t like him.”

Kingdom also went through a very difficult time with Pitt hurdle
coach Steve Lewis and decided to redshirt for the outdoor season.

“There's a lot of speculation,”'Kingdom said, “a lot of talk ﬂoating
around that coach Lewis said that he made me in the hurdles and all
that kind of stuff.

“That was one of the reasons for the personality conflict that came
about.

“You can’t make a hurdler. You can't make an athlete. The talent is
already there, the athlete must make himself.

“He just needs somebody to bring it out of him. I worked for a long
time with Elbert before I even met Coach Lewis.“

Pitt coach John Vasvary said, “I would just that it's one of those

I ' I 9 things that happens in people relationships. They just didn‘t get
WI Ill IS TGCI Ill. along."

“Roger is very unique,” Kennedy said. “He needs a great deal of
personal attention. He had a very difficult time adjusting to Pitt
because he didn‘t have the instant success. It took him a long time."

Kingdom believes he gained his competitive edge while training
with New Image during the summers following Pitt academic years.

“It took a while, but the difference is patience," Kingdom said.
“Even if I could get everything that people say I could get, patience is
still the key to the game."

 

Last month, the Pitt junior qualified for the U.S. Olympic track
and ﬁeld team by placing third (l3.36) at the Olympic trials in the
l l0-meter high hurdles behind Tonie Campbell and trial champion
Greg Foster.

The American trio is favored to sweep the gold, silver and bronze
medals.

“Roger doesn't have doubts,” Vasvary said. “He knows exactly
what he is capable of doing. His accomplishments don't surprise him.
He's a very self-motivated person, and I think you can tell that by just
talking to him.

“It‘s a great feeling; l’ve been psyched up since I made the team,”
Kingdom said. “But I‘m the type of person who sets goals extremely
high. So therefore, if you don't reach the highest one, the goal that
you do reach is high enough that you are able to settle with it at that

photos by; point before you try to reach the highest one."

Jen-y EH30”, He is considered to have an outside shot at the gold.

Tim Moershl “My precise goal for the Olympics is to do the best and make the
Mark pom - best effort toward getting the gold medal as I can," Kingdom said. “I

want to win it for myself and for my family."

Kingdom won the only race that Foster has lost this season. In
fact, he beat Campbell and Foster at the Bruce Jenner Classic in
June.

“It's a different system and a different
coach, but they all want the same thing.
They want everything to be done right

-—-Patrick Ewing

Big East stars compete as Olympians

By Todd Erkel
Senior Editor

PHOENIX  Every four years,col—
lege basketball players from the Uni-
ted States undergo a process of
adaptation to prepare for the Olym-
pics. This year, along with adjusting
to foreign competition and interna-
tional rules, the U.S. team must
learn a different way of life - the
Bobby Knight way.

For the past three seasons, Chris
Mullin and Partick Ewing have
studied basketball undertwo men
St. John's Louie Carnesecca and
Georgetown's John Thompson --
who,despitetheir differences,can be
called players‘ coaches.

This summer, however, Mullin
and Ewing have given up civilian life
in the Big East conference to play
basketball under the cold stares and
verbal lashings of General Knight,
whose zeal for the loose ball and a
relentless man—to-man defense has
caused greater athletes to
reconsider.

But Mullin and Ewing say they
welcome the challenge and have
learned from Knight‘s methods. The
differences between Knight and
other coaches, they say, are not as
glaring as some people think.

“It's a different system and a dif-
ferent coach, but they all want the
same thing," Ewing said.

“They [coaches] want everything
to be done right and they want to
win."

Ewing sat icing down both of his
knees, a post-game ritual for him,
following the Olympic team's 84-72
win over a collection of NBA players
Saturday at the Veteran's Memorial
Colliseum.

Ewing finished the game with 10
points on 5 for 6 shooting from the
field. He also pulled down 5
rebounds and blocked the first shot
taken in the game.

It was the eighth straight win in
this series for the younger and better
conditioned Olympic team over
teams of vacationing NBA players.
Knight’s squad will play their last
exhibition tonight in San Diego
before opening the Olympic Games
Sunday against China.

Mullin, who came into Saturday‘s
game as the team’s second leading
scorer with a l4_7—point average,
managed only three points in II
minutes of play. He spent at least as
much time at the sidelines listening
to Knight.

Mullin said it is important to
understand Knight‘s reasoning as a
coach.

“He's not really yelling at you the
person. he’s just trying to keep you
from making the same mistakes,"
Mullin said.

“Coach Carnesecca does the same
thing. He puts in so much time pre-
paring for a game that he expects
you to do the same. They are both
perfectionists."

The perfectionist in Knight
refused to acknowledge what many
consider to be the only sure thing of
the L.A. Games: his team's chances
for the gold medal.

“I think we have made progress,
but it’s difficult to judge where we
are," Knight said.

“Could these guys [NBA all-stars]
beat Spain or Italy? 1 don‘t know.
Can we beat China? 1 don‘t know."

When asked whether some people
have taken the gold medal’ for

granted, Knight responded, “I sure
as hell don't."

After playing his best game of the
series, Ewing said he is anxious to
stop the talking and start the playing
“tomorrow."

ln his own inimitable way, Knight
agreed. “l‘m sure a lot of people
want the games to start tomorrow,”
he said, “but we sure as hell can’t
change the schedule."

If they did, nobody is sure who
would make up the starting five for
the U.S. team. Knight has used a
different starting line—up in all eight
exhibitions, and playing time has
been almost equally divided among
nine players.

Michael Jordan erased any
doubts about his importance here
with a series—high 27 points, includ-
ing two slam dunks that left the likes
of Earvin “Magic" Johnson and
Walter Davis somewhat embar-
rassed and impressed.

Sam Perkins, .lordan‘s teammate
at North Carolina, added a quiet l6
and a game—high seven rebounds.

Aside from the two ex-Tarheels,
Knight’s starters will be anyone‘s

' guess right up until game time.

Ewing has come on of late after a
slow start. His rebound average of
4.4 was the third highest behind
Oklahoma's Wayman Tisdale and
guard Alvin Robertson. Saturday he
displayed some of the intensity
which has made him the most
imposing collegiate in the past three
seasons.

Los Angeles Laker Michael
Cooper received a rude introduction
to Ewing’s strength midway through
the first half when the 7-foot Hoya
drove to the baseline and delivered a
flying slam dunk.

“For a split second, I thought
about reaching out and trying to
block him," Cooper said, “then I
quickly came back to reality and
moved out of the way.

“He‘s going to be a force to reckon
with in the NBA. ljust hope he is in a
Laker uniform and l am still there."

Mullin has been used primarily
against zone defenses, which the
U.S. should see plenty of in L.A.

“lt’s a lot different from what lam
used to,“ Mullin said of the sixth
man role Knight has apparently
given him. “But if that is my role, l
have to fill it the best I know how."

Mullin‘s outside shooting, which
almost single-handedly carried St.
John‘s into the NCAA Tournament
last year, will be very important to
Knight.

“From what I hear, there will be a
lot more zones [in L.A.]," Mullin
said.

Mullin, Ewing and the rest of the
Olympic team have been practicing
twice a day for two months in addi-
tion to their exhibition schedule.

Mullin said that he too is anxious
to compete in the games, but he
added, “l’m also looking forward to
getting home."

Back to the streets and play-
grounds of Brooklyn. Back to see
Louie and to get into his civilian
clothes.

Giles ready for comebook

By Donald Porter

Staff Writer

Rodney Giles, a sophomore half-
miler nicknamed “Bird" who had his
wings, clipped as a freshman for aca-
demic reasons, is ready to fly for
John Vasvary‘s track team this
season.

Giles graduated from Northern
High in Owings, Md., as a full-
ﬂedged track star. Last July, he won
the 800-meter titles at both the
indoor and outdoor Athletic Con-
gress Junior National Track and
Field Championships at Penn State.

The victory qualified him to com-
pete with the U.S. Junior National
team last year. He also finished forth
in the Millrose Games in New York
and placed second by .0l seconds at
the Golden West Invitational in
Sacramento in 1983.

Giles, a communications major,
had to sit out a season for academic
reasons. After his high school
records were reviewed, it was sug-
gested that he concentrate on his
academics before pursuing athletics
at Pitt.

He spent this past school year for-
tifying his QPA and training with
Pitt sophomore Clinton Davis,
whom he met on thejunior national
squad. He said he is fully prepared to
participate in athletics this year.

“It took a lot out of me, not run-
ning, but I can't wait to run again,“
Giles said.

Giles, who has run the 800-meters
in l:48.56 and his leg of the 3,200-
meter relay in l:46, will run cross
country this fall to prepare himself
for the indoor and outdoor track
seasons. He is looked on as a rising
star in Pitt's program, but that is
nothing new to him.

As a high school senior, Giles cap-
tured 400-, 800- and 1,600-meter
titles and anchored a winning 3,200
meter relay team in the Maryland
Class A meet. The seventh fastest

half-miler in high school history, he l

finished tenth in the Track and Field
News‘ Athlete of the Year balloting.
Davis, who graduated from Steel
Valley High before coming to Pitt,
won the award. ‘
Vasvary projects Giles, who has
four years of remaining eligibility, as

Rodney Giles will finally get his chance this season.

“Rodney has a lot of heart and
guts," he said. “A teammate said in a
meeting that he was glad to be run-
ning behind Giles, and Rodney
[Giles] told him that we are a team;
we run together. He has a lot of

Despite his accomplishments,
Giles is hardly satisfied. He hopes to
qualify for the NCAA meet in the
800-meter run in his first season.

“I have a lot to prove to people
now that I‘m back," said Giles.

Henkel murder case

By Jerry Ellson
Staff Writer

Pitt professor, student uncover corpse

As an archaeologist, Pitt anthro-
pology professor Jeffrey Schwartz
spends much of his time digging for
bones. Last Thursday, Schwartz and

Pitt doctoral student Dennis Dirk-_

maat found what they were looking
for —— the remains of a victim of
convicted murderer Richard
Henkel.

The two men, accompanied by
about 40 Pennsylvania state and
Allegheny County police officers,
found a human femur bone in a shal-
low grave at a site in Westmoreland
County which Henkel identified ear-
lier in the week.

The skeletal remains, believed to
be seven years old, ofa 6-3 male were
found in the grave. A spent bullet lay
near the skull, and strands of hair
and pieces of tissue still clung to the
skeleton. No other «identifying
marks were discovered.

The victim, as yet unidentified,
could be either Andrew Russman or
Bruce‘Agnew, both robbery suspects
along with Henkel.

The two men disappeared in I977
after being arrested with Henkel in
connection with a bank robbery.
Henkel, now incarcerated in a fed-
eral prison in Illinois, agreed to lead
authorities to the gravesites in
exchange for being spared the death
penalty for the slaying of Deborah
Gentile, his former employee.

Security was tight last week when
Henkel led authorities to the site in
North Washington Twp., partly
because he had tried to escape from
Western Penitentiary in April I983.
During the search for the gravesite,
an anonymous tipster phoned the
Washington Boulevard barracks of
the state police, claiming that one of
the two possible sites had been

booby-trapped with explosives.
..«Henkel denied any personal asso-
ciation with the threat but claimed
that an unnamed associate did have
sufficient knowledge to arrange the

Authorities combed the two sites
with metal detectors and failed to
turn up any evidence of explosives.

the hunt indefinitely.

Schwartz said he was “nervous"
about the search. He and Dirkmaat
unearthed the remains but allowed

the Allegheny County Crime Unit to
handle the rest of the recovery.

Schwartz described the feeling of
discovering the skeleton of a mur~

From page 7

Foster stumbled and fell, but
Kingdom beat Campbell flat
out. It was the first and only time
that Kingdom has beaten Foster.

However, at the Pan Ameri-
can Games last August, he beat

uCampbell and former two—time

Olympic silver medalist Alberto
Casanas. It put Kingdom on the

’_ map.

Aside from his U.S. competi-
tion, only Canada’s Mark
McKoy is regarded to be a medal
contender.

Kingdom beat McKoy at the
Jumbo Elliot Track Classic at
Villanova on July 14. Kingdom
registered at lifetime best mark
of 13.32, edging McKoy (13.36).

This past weekend at the final
Olympic prep meet in Sacra-
mento, Calif., Kingdom turned
in ‘an awesome performance
blowing out the field in a time of
l3.00 —— the third fastest time
ever recorded under any condi-
tions. The wind was measured at
an illegal 6 miles per hour.

“He ran a I3 flat, and he still
has problems," Kennedy said.
“His race has always depended
on the first hurdle. If he is still in
the race after the first hurdle,

‘ then he can run with anybody.

“I think he‘s the fastest guy in

told him that last week before he

he thought about for a long
time.”

dom can run under 13 seconds, a
feat accomplished by only one
man, former world record
holder-turned San Francisco
40» Renaldo Nehemiah.
Nehemiah has said that King-
dom is the one to watch in the
Games on August 6 —- the day of
the ll0-meter high hurdle final.
“On that day, I'll be in front of
l00,000 spectators,” Kingdom

said. “And they’ll be focusing

down on Roger Kingdom, Greg
Foster, Tonic Campbell. That's
what they’re focusing down on,
not Pitt track of the New Image
Track Club and so forth.
“They're focusing down on the
individual, so that has to be one

of the greatest honors that an.

athlete can experience.”

Kingdom is from a very close
family that runs a farm in
Georgia.

“They‘re real excited when-
ever I do well,” Kingdom said.
“But they‘re behind me when I
don‘t do well. They back me a
lot.

“It makes me feel proud to
know that I have been able to
accomplish the things that I
wanted to do. They‘ve handled
everything real well.”

The three children Roger, 2|;
Laurie, 23; and Roy, 25, each
won athletic scholarships after
graduating from Vienna High
School. Laurie and Roy both
attended Albany State College
in Albany, Georgia.

Laurie played basketball and
ran track, while Roy was a run-
ning back on the football team.

Roy was given a tryout with

the Seattle Seahawks of the
NFL. He made it past the third
cut before he wasiiforced to pull
out of the tryout because of
injury.

“He left after they found out
that he had a fractured cervical
vertebrae," Kingdom said.

“They didn’t get any national
publicity, but everybody in our
neighborhood knew them,“
Kingdom said.

His parents never got involved
in sports since they were too
busy worrying about work on
the farm and taking care of the
children.

Christine Kingdom, Roger’s
mother, is always the first person
Roger calls.

“I called my mother the day of
the Olympic trials [the day he
qualified for the U.S. team] and
she told me that it would be OK
no matter how i did. That
changed my outlook and I was
relaxed."

Kingdom will probably come
into a large sum of money from
an athletic outfitter or shoe com-
pany if he is able to win a medal
at the Games.

“I want to do something very
special for my family when I get
into a situation like that.“ ht-
said.

The Olympics are front and
center for Roger Kingdom and
will be through August 6. Then
he is scheduled to tour Europe as
a member of the U.S. national
team.

He will be back in Pittsburgh
on Sept. 2, and a big decision
about his future in athletics will
soon follow.

Will he persue football or the
hurdles or the decathlon? Will he
stay at Pitt for his degree‘?

“Right now, I think Roger

‘wants to prove that he can still

play football,” Vasvary said.
“He may come back from the
Olympics and have a different
idea." '

The only thing that Kingdom
appears to have a clear cut deci-
sion on is academics.

“I want my degree,” Kingdom
said. “I will definitely be back at
Pitt. It’s just a matter of whether
I’m on a football scholarship or
going part-time, but I will go to
school.”

“I think Roger has his priori-
ties in line,” Kennedy said. “He
wants to get his degree, and he
believes it’s worth it.” _

Kingdom has made it clear
that he will not accept a track
scholarship, under any
circumstance.

“At Pitt, I‘ve always had a
football scholarship,“ Kingdom
explained. “I came up here to
play football for Pitt, not to run
track.

“[Running track] is something
that just came about. The times
that I did run for Pitt, I enjoyed.
But a track scholarship just
would not work. The thing I
want to do is play football.

“If I just had to base all my
trainingion track, well, I would
have gone to Tennessee, Villan-
ova or USC [Southern Califor-
nia] — the track oriented
schools. Pitt is not in that league.

“They may be there in a year
or so, but in my eligibility time,
they will not be in that league.”

Pitt athletic director Dr. Ed
Bozik said that Kingdom will get

a scholarship, not specifying the
sport, if he is academically
eligible. if

He apparently needs to pass
the three-credit course in which
he is currently enrolled to main-
tain eligibility.

Pitt football coach Foge Fazio
said that Kingdom is welcome to
play football despite the fact that
he will miss all of fall camp and
the opener on Sept. l against
Brigham Young. I

“He’ll be given a fair shot just
like everybody,” Fazio said.

Vasvary is prepared for any
decision.

“The only races we asked him
to run for us were the Big East
and the NCAA; other than that,
he ran in «the races that best
suited his Olympic goals," Vas-
vary said. “The decision is up to
Roger.”

The other opportunity availa-
ble to Kingdom is the decathlon.
He has competed in eight of the
10 events and were he to score
average marks in the pole vault
and I500 (the two events that he
hasn‘t tried), he would rank
second in the world.

“His competency level in so
many of the events is unmatched
by other decathletes,” Kennedy
said. “No one could touch him in
the high jump, the hurdles and
the hundred.

“If he can learn the pole vault,
the javelin and the I500, he
would be right there.”

In time, the rest of his story
will be told, but there are no
right or wrong answers now. In
five or IO years, Roger Kingdom
will be able to look back upon
the decision and have his own
ideas about the results.
