“If you ever wanted to be Spanish by
marriage, here’s your chance!”

That’s what a member of La Tuna
yelled out yesterday during their perfor-
mance in the William Pitt Union.

La Tuna, a. musical group from the
University of Valladolid in Spain, wandered
throughout Pitt while playing tradition
Spanish instruments. '

In between marriage proposals — and
there were a lot of proposals — members of
La Tuna serenaded onlookers with love
songs and original compositions, as well as
popular Spanish music. The group also
played games with tl1e audience. A

“It was kind of weird at ﬁrst, sitting in .
the lobby [of the Union] with them circling
arotmd us, asking us to many them,” said
Jenny Fox, a freshman Spanish student. “Bu
overall, it was very cool.” A A

Many universities in Spain have musi-

music groups are large and all male.

with the music.

“It was good to actually
see Spanish culture instead of just
reading about it,” Courtney Smith
said. Srnith’s Spanish class has

i recently been discussing the histo-
ry of tunas in preparation for the
visit.

Many of the students at
Pitt currently enrolled in Spanish
classes were encouraged to attend
the event, since the opportunity to
see a tuna live is very rare.

“It is always interesting
for me to leam about Spanish culture,” Fox
said. “It was something that I had never
heard of before.” .

For a fraternity that had raised
$76,202 for charity in five years,
Sigma Chi was pretty quiet last year.

The fraternity that had won,
twice in five years, the Cathedral
Award —— given to the most out-
standing fraternity and sorority on
campus —— wassuspended for a year
after being charged with institution-
al vandalism.

After a year of planning, reorga-
nizing and a lot of waiting, however,
the men of Sigma Chi say they are
looking forward to coming back to
the Greek scene at Pitt. l_

“I think [the suspension] really
helped us a lot,” said Jonathan

the fraternity." “We were really,

shocked by the sanctions, but we’re
the ones who caused the problems.
We don’t blame the University.”

, The members of Sigma Chi said
the punishment gave them a chance
to reconsider their goals and strate-
gies for this year. 1

Without the work involved in
planning for rush week Sigma
Chi was prohibited from participat-
ing in rush events last year — the
fraternity was able to look at its sys-
tem and improve its rush and pledg-

Sites: a social services pioneer

KATHERINE BRINTON

An accumulation of 40 years worth ‘

of books and other academia, four brief
cases, a cluster of ﬁle cabinets and innu-
merable , pictures of blond beauties,
“beloved” grandchildren, pepper ‘a 23rd-
ﬂoor office in the Cathedral of Learning.
Patterned bow ties, starched white
collars, and gigantic glasses may evoke
an image of a stodgy, 19th-century pro-
fessor, but according to doctoral student
Virginia Davidovich, Professor Edward
Sites is “a pioneer on the leading edge of
social services.” V ‘
And his lengthy credentials prove it.
Sites has been an active professor at

. Pitt’s School of Social Work since 1978

and has been a faculty field adviser
since 1966.

He has served as a board member, I

chair or consultant for numerous child
welfare advocacy groups and has pro-
vided pro bono consulting services for

not—for-proﬁt organizations.

.In addition, he has been a principal
investigator on at least one state or fed-
eral foundation- or agency—funded grant
in the ﬁeld of child welfareeducation

every year since 1971.

As a third-generation social worker,
he imagined his life in rural Fayetteville,
N .C., as permanent until one fateful call

in 1965, which he dubbed his career-_

‘defining moment.

Unexpectedly, Sites received an
invitation to teach in the ever-demand-
ing ﬁeld of social work at Pitt. He
adamantly refused. _

“I was happy as a clam,” Sites said.
But the caller persisted, and to “humor”
him, Sites made the long trek to
Pittsburgh to hear him out. “I’ve been

Older Chinese left yearning for their independence

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

For college students in the United
States, the question of what their par-

ents will do when they retire often a

seems to be a far—off prospect. In an
era of 40l(k)s, retirement nest eggs
and numerous assisted living and
retirement communities, the idea of
parents coming to live with — and
being financially dependent on -
their kids is becoming increasingly
unusual in American society.

Yet in many parts of the world, the
idea of the folks moving in during

their golden years is seen as normal,
especially in "societies less wealthy
than the:Ut1ited States. ' it
In -the Department of
Anthropology’s lounge on Monday

afternoon’, Eric Millergave a talk on’

his findings from. a study he did. on
such living situations in one commu-
nity in the r'1‘i'1’1‘al,—'l_nior'them foothills of
China. ' - “ ' A
Miller, the administrative coordi-
nator of The China Law Center at Yale
Law School, provided excerpts from
his dissertation for his doctorate in a
presentation titled, "‘Y_earning for
Independence: Chinese Elders and

Separate Residences in Rural North
China.”

“I often tell people my research
topic is primarily on aging,” Miller
said. “But the discussion here is not so

much the process of aging, as about

the inter-generational relationships
involving people in old age with their
adult children.”

To gather information for his
study, Miller spent time in Mazhuang,
a small, rural village in the central part

of Shandong Province in northeast

China. While the coastal towns of the
province are relatively prosperous in
wealth and population, Miller‘ said

more sparsely populated inland com-
munities, such as Mazhuang, are
reliant on access to roads, and railroad
lines to bring businesses and factories
to provide money and jobs to their
areas.

The idea of gaining wealth
through working wages is important in
a country where there is no private

property, especially in rural areas.

According to Miller, land_ in
Mazhuang is largely distributed by the
dictates of the government. After
retirement, the elderly pass their prop-
erty on to their children and are “at the
mercy” of their kin to letthem live in
a house that is no longer legally theirs.

The issue of who holds wealth cre-
ates, in Miller’s view, a relationship
based on “power” with regard to a par-
ent giving up his or her ability to
“determine their own circumstances”
financially and legally in return for
staying with their children and retain-
ing some of their previous familial
leverage as head of the household.

“A parent, for example, builds up
a household industry, and they run this
business and start making a lot of
money,” said Miller, giving an exam-

‘_ ple of this relationship of power.

“They may give control of that com-
pany that they built up to their son to
run. They don’t necessarily have con-
trol of that factory anymore, but their
son still owes them for their ‘power’
in this relationship and their ability to
get what they want,” he added. “So the
parent can ask more in return.”

This kind of leverage is even more
important because of China’s “one—
child” policy that legally; encourages

families to restrict their number of off-
spring, thus, limiting a parent’s retire-

ment living options. \

“If older people have power in that
relationship, then they’re not as inter-
ested in having separate residences or

being apart from their children,”

Miller said. “It’s when they don’t have
much‘ power in that relationship that
they desire independence.”

That is to say, elderly people who
demand their children build them a
small separate residence on their prop-
erty, instead of being “secluded to a
side room of the house.” This often
occurs, Miller said, when older people
in the village don’t feel theyare being
treated properly — or are even being
abused — and desire personal inde-
pendence at the expense of familial
relevance,_ an often embarrassing
prospect to children in the eyes of
Chinese society. —

‘ Another issue is age of retirement.
While 60 to 65 years old is generally
seen as an American standard, in

THE PITT NEWS

Suspension served as a wake-
up call for Greek community

Sigma Chi, page 1

He added that the fraternity
hopes to come back stronger than
before the incident.

“We realized that something like
this doesn’t have to happen in the
future,” said Ryan Kurtz, Sigma
Chi’s public relations chair. '

S 1 ‘‘There’s no room for a fraternity
or sorority to foul up or to engage in
any potentially harmful act,”
DuBoff said. “There’s just no room
for error.”

“It certainly was a wake—up call
to everyone on [Fraternity] Hill,” he
added. '

Though the members of Sigma
Chi said the incident leading to their
sanctions was not serious, the
response to the incident was.

“There was not permanent dam-
age done. It was just cosmetic,”
DuBoff said of the damage done to
their on-campus fraternity house last
year.

DuBoff said that the Pitt police
discovered the mess early in the
morning when the officers, on a rou-
tine patrol, responded to a report of
a “commotion” coming from the
Sigma Chi house.

He added that the fraternity
members had cleaned the mess with-
in two hours, before University offi-
cials arrived at 8 a.m.

DuBoff described the original
sanction handed down as a result of
the mess — a sanction that included

2 three years of probation and the loss

of their on-campus. fraternity house
— as a “fraternal death sentence.”
“If we did all that, we would
have lost our charter,” DuBoff said.
Once a fraternity loses its char-
ter, he explained, the chapter cannot
exist.
The group must wait four years
— until all the members of the fra-
ternity* at the time _it lost its charter
have graduated — before "it can be
recognized as a colony at the univer-
sity where the chapter once existed.
After five years_of being recog-
nized as a colony at a university, and

_ nine years after the charter-revoking

incident, the group can become a
chapter again.

“This was our first major infrac-
tion,” DuBoff said. “There wasn’t
any precedent by which we were
assessed for these sanctions. We’re
an upstanding fraternity.”

“It was like going after a mouse
with a bazooka, as one of our alum-
ni put it,” DuBoff added.

Anita Triggs, who assumed the
position of Greek life coordinator on
July 1, came-to Pitt after the inci-
dent had occurred and the final
sanctions were in place.

But Triggs said there is no for-
'mula for dealing "with fraternities
and sororities. .

I “There really is no ‘usual pun-
ishment,’”. Triggs said. “I hate to
ever have a sort of blanket sanction,
because every circumstance I come
across is a little different.”

After gathering the support of
Sigma Chi alumni, the fraternity
appealed the original, three -year
decision. Considering the appeal,
Pitt reduced Sigma Chi’s punish-
ment to a one-year suspension from
all Greek activities. V

In addition, each member living
in the fraternity house had to per-
form l5 hours of community ser-
vice, and no member living in the
house at the time of the incident was
allowed to live on campus this year.

Triggs said she prefers to con-
sider each case by itself, looking at
the individuals and circumstances
involved. _

Having come to Pitt recently,
Triggs could not name the last time
a fraternity or sorority was sanc-
tioned as Sigma Chi was.

“It’s hard for me to speak to
what is usual at Pitt, having been
here for such a short time,” she said.

Triggs said that, after her
arrival, University » officials

explained to her that Sigma Chi.

members had “destroyed their com-
mons space in their fraternity
house.”

“It was a great burden on a num-
ber of people,” Triggs said. “I think
that may be where the severity in the
sanctions‘ came in.”

“What we always hope is that

Dependence
applies not

only to China

China, page 2 ‘

China there is a wider range.
According to Miller, it tends to vary

from age 50 for women who are blue-

collar workers, to 60 for men who are
white-collar workers. People in the
agriculture industry often work for as
long as they are physically able to,
with farmers in their 70s and 80s not_
being uncommon. ‘Thus, Miller
defined the elderly in his Mazhuang
study as aged 50 and above. ‘
-Miller accompanied his presenta-
tion with a slide show of pictures
showing scenes of everyday life in the
village. Among the photos were some
of the activities that the elderly
engaged in to contribute to their fam-
ilies. There were pictures of vegeta-
bles grown in the gardens planted by
many elderly Mazhuang residents as a
way to save money, as well as images
of shoes handmade by one _older
woman to sell for a bit of extra
income. =
“I don’t think this is something
which just applies necessarily to
China,” Miller said. “There’s a corol-
lary in that the old might be content
with dependence, even in American
society, because I don’t think people
desire dependence on their children,
but they may be more comfortable

with it to the extent that they have .

control over that relationship.”

students will have some time to
think about what got them into this,”
Triggs said of Sigma Chi’s sanc-
tions, adding that it might help them
with “realizing that having social
privileges is not what fraternity life
is all about.” _

“It was time to be a great student
and to focus on rebuilding a chap-
ter,” Triggs said of last, year, when
the group was prohibited from par-
ticipating in any Greek events or
meeting as a fraternity. She added,
however, that she had no objection

‘to, the members meeting to discuss

rebuilding plans — or finding some-
thing good in the sanctions.
“I’m not a tyrant, and I don’t

want students to feel like their sanc-

tions should be a total punishment.”

Having served their community
service hours and waited out their
year of suspension, the members of
Sigma Chi will be back on the Greek
scene during rush events at the end
of January. Their year of sanctions

, ended with the fall term, and Triggs

said the group will not be monitored
more closely than usual in the com-
ing year.

“My

understanding, having

talked with various people, is that

Sigma Chi has a strong reputation
here,” she said. ,

The members of Sigma Chi, who
spent many of their community ser-
vice hours working to turn an aban-
doned church‘ in North Negley into a
community center for The Union
Project, agreed with Triggs’ assess-
ment.

“I can say that we were missed
at rush,” DuBoff said, adding that he
does not believe the group will face
any negative stigma now that the
sanctions are finished.

“We’re really looking forward to
being back on campus,” Kurtz
added.

gets -his way, the United States will
begin two initiatives that will cost
billions of dollars and will leave a
gigantic legacy of debt, homopho-
bia and xenophobia. , .
For months, administration offi-
cials have been planning a propos-
al, costing at least $1.5 billion, to
help couples sustain healthy mar-

riage through better interpersonal‘

skills. Several studies have indicat-
ed that children growing upin a
two-parent household fare the best,
so the proposal is putatively aimed
at making life better for American
children, and seems innocuous,
even beneficial.

Not so, upon closer look.

The program, of course, would

only be available to heterosexual 3

couples. The hypocrisy in that stric-
ture is sickening. Gay parents exist,
and it’s conceivable that in today’s

' officially homophobic society, they
might need a little help keeping,

things in the home running smooth-
ly. Ignoring gay parents won’t make
them go away, and denying them
support won’t make their children’s
lives any easier.

The program wants to get into
the lives of American couples. That
doesn’t sound much like small gov-
ernment. Instead, it is a direct,
knee-jerk reaction to a perceived
threat to the institution of marriage

in the. form of gay marriage in

Massachusetts. '. The institution  ’ Ti ’

marriage has been . around a lot
longer than compassionate conser-
vatism,‘and it’s likely it will some-

howliinp on long after Bush is- 

gone.g ,—. -

The second proposal is, quite
simply, a ludicrous idea, a phenom-
enalxwaste of money, and one more
step in what seems to be Bush’s

plan to secedepfrom. the world at‘

large.

also wants to strive to get humans
to Mars. By 2010, he wants the
United‘ States to withdraw from the
International Space Station.

If the nations were in times of

prosperity, it would be wonderful to I

see such a commitment to scientific
exploration. The nation, however, is
in financial trouble. This space pro-
gram, then, would merely be a
white elephant, a financial burden
whose returns don’t match the
investment. Pulling out of the
International Space Station just
smacks of taking our ball and going
home, because we don’t want to
play with the rest of the world.

It’s ironic that, in light of the
proposal to shore up marital unions
in America, Bush is methodically
divorcing us from the rest of the
world.

 H’ Treasury Secretary and

_Pittsburgh ‘native Paul O’Neill, speaking

at last year’s. University of Pittsburgh

might have seemed an odd note. After
sketching the wide vistas and possible
futures ppen to that year’s graduating
class, congratulating them on their drive
and dedication, and generally ‘saying all
the things you expect to hear‘ at a gradua-
tion ceremony, though with an offhand
eloquence more engaging than most of
those he shared the podium with, O’Neill
got tohis real point . _ E I
‘ He told us to have ‘fun. ,
Admittedly, that’s a pretty
easy sentiment.‘ It’s easy to tell
people, to have fun when
you’re successful, having
spent twelve years- as chief
executive oﬂicer and chairman
of Alcoa, the world’s largest
aluminum manufacturer, then
moving into the Bush cabinet
in 2000. It’s easy to look back '
on a fulﬁlling life and career
and recognize how much fun
you really did have. It’s harder
to be a college student in the audience, fac-
ing the deep unknownvof your future,‘ and
think about all the ftm times you’re going
to have. First you have to unclench the
white-knuckle grip oniyour diploma and
realize, “Wait, ,he’s telling us we can have

that all his accomplishments had been not

of walking—around money, but really, the
fact is, he mostly just had a good time

speaking honestly and openly about the
third round of Bush tax cuts, which he saw
as urmecessaty and ﬁscally damaging,
O’Neill was asked for his resignation.
Vice President Dick Cheney, instrumental
in O’Neill’s removal from office, suggest-

ed he claimhe wanted to return to private

life. ' With typical bluntness, O’Neill
responded, “I’m not willing to say I want
to return to private life because I’m too old
to begin telling lies now.”

It’s that dedication to candor that’s I

making O’Neill and the book, “The Price
of Loyalty: George W. Bush, The White
House, and The Education
of Paul O’Neill,” by Ron
Suskind, a lightning rod for
political controversy.
Suskind wrote the book with
extensive help from O’Neill,
who offered hours of inter-
view time and over 19,000
documents he’d collected
during his time in the
Cabinet. What emerges is an
insider’s View of the Bush
White House during its ﬁrst
. two years.

The press and several‘ Democratic

candidates have already latched on to

some of the more incendiary sections of
the book, mostly relating to cabinet-level
meetings at which the invasion of Iraq was
discussed. a solid eight months prior to
Sept. 11, 2001. -O’Neill claims plans to
topple Saddam Hussein were in place vir-
tually from day one. He also says that, dur-
ing his time as a member of the National
Security Council, he saw no evidence of
Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction.

It’s said that human beings can only
handle so much truth, and in the case of
governments, the manageable amount is
even less. Donald Rurnsfeld, secretary of

Stab me in the ribs and ask if we can be friends

“Alcohol. You need alcohol,”
my friend on the other end of the
phone line is saying.

Two minutes earlier, I had been
dumped.

“Dumped;” the word is bother-
ing me. A

Other things (besides myself)
that come to mind that are dumped:
garbage, toxic waste, raw sewage.

“Dump” is a euphemism for
excreting fecal matter.

All of a sudden, I find myself
being categorized with toxic waste
and poo. ' ,

As Chris from “Family Guy”
would say, “I’m not supposed to
mention ‘poo’ — Oh, God! What
have I done!?”

Chris, I know what you mean.

Thirteen hours and‘ one hang-
over later, I am awake.

Ben Folds Five’s “Song For The
Dumped”_is on my stereo, the vol-
ume at a high level, and I’m jump-
ingaround in my boxer shorts
screaming, “give me my money
back, give me my money back, you
bitch! And don’t forget my black T-
shirt.” .

This is when I remember that
my ex actually still has a favorite
black T—shirt of mine.

“Ha, ha, life imitating art,” I
think.

Oh, poo.

Thus sets in motion the internal-
ly violent series of super—cross—
examining the events of the
breakup.

Bonding with my roommate
takes place first over lost clothing
items.

‘‘I lost a hoodie,” he tells me.
“My favorite hoodie. Not too big,
not too small, just perfect — now
it’s gone. I bet she keeps it in the
bottom of her closet and uses it only
to clean up dog crap.”

I solemnly nod my “testify,
brother, testify” kind of nod.

He warns me against becoming
emotionally attached to apparel.

I cringe. ’

Why did I let her borrow my
Rolling Stones T-shirt?

Why, why, why?

I remember; she looked amaz-
ingly hot wearing it.

But that isn’t doing me any
good right now. ,

I try to nurture secret hope of
seeing my shirt returned to me but
also exhale and start considering its
replacement.

I utter one final
change the subject.

Why do they always give you
the line “let’s still be friends?” I
mean, if I live long enough, I’m
certainly not ruling out a bond

“why! ?” and

 

forming between the two us when timing.

we coincidently meet in a
nursing home.

We’ll be laying in
adjacent beds, staving off
deathand secretly hoping
for one final moment of
passion before the
Reaper comes.

But why are you ask-
ing me now, 2.8 seconds
post-breakup?

Come on, you guys
are a smart gender, think

 

David J. McCarthy

of something better to
say, or at least change the

I mean, this is like
Brutus pulling the knife
from Julius Caesar’s rib
cage, then being all like,
“Hey, I mean, seriously
Jules, it’s me, it’s not
you, OK, ljust want you
to know that. I mean,
sure, your heart is leak-
ing out of your chest, but
can we still be friends?
Think about it. You don’t
have to answer now.”

Ugh.

Caesar understands my

pain.

“Bruce Springsteen understands
my pain,” I tell myself.

Tunnel of Love is in my CD
player, and I’m formulating my
plan to become a rock star.

I’ve got the title of my first
song down: “The Worst Thing You
Said to Me is Goodbye.”

Okay, not exactly “Brilliant
Disguise,” I know, but it’s a start.

I’m quite sure that the lyrics and
guitar-playing skill will fall into
line later.

O’Neill’s book
is illumination
without rancor

Hicks, page 6

wary of such tell-allbooks as the former
Treasury secretary has participated in,
because they only show a “narrow, little
slice of what they saw, not a 360-degree
view.” Yet that mythical 360-degree View
is possible only from the vantage point of
history, and maybe not even then; O’Neill
has simply told what he saw, without
embellishment or political rancor. That his
view ﬁnds a wider audience at a time that
is inconvenient for Donald Rumsfeld is a
problem for the secretary of Defense, not
O’Neill or Suskind. -

Already, though, the Treasury
into those documents O’Neill took with
him. The administration claims the docu-
ments are classiﬁed; O’Neill says they
were released by the Treasmy’s. general
counsel. Critics note the speed with which
an investigation was begun — literally
within hours of O’Neill’s Sunday appear-
ance on “6O Minutes” — and wonder,
rhetorically, at the speed of such an
inquiry, next to the molasses-like pace of
the probe into who outed CIA operative
Valerie Plame. . -

Most of these ﬁrecrackers are back-
ground noise, yet somehow they’ve
drowned out Paul O’Neill’s stated aim for
writing the book, “I hope people will read
it because I think it makes a contribution
to illuminating, especially for young peo-
ple, what I consider to be a bipartisan, bro-
ken political process.”

I‘ hope it will be illuminating, Mr.
O’Neill. If not for this generation, then
maybe for the next. But most of all, I hope
you’re having fun.

PAGE 10

Enjoyable despite cursing

This Thing of Ours

Starring Danny Provenzano,
Frank Vincent, Vincent Pastore,
Edward Lynch, James Caan

Directed by Danny Provenzano
skiksk

The sentiments of generations
clash in “This Thing of Ours,” the lat-
est mob film to come out of the suc-
cess of “The Sopranos.” ‘

On one side, there are the tech-
savvy, 2lst—century criminals led by
Nick Santini (Danny Provenzano) and
two of his buddies who have come up
with an idea to steal billions from
credit card companies and banks. On
the other side are the old guys; good-
fellas who’ve made their bones in
mob wars over drugs and gambling
and now can’t make heads or tales of
the scheme their proteges are hatch-
ing.
Worse than that, though, the
young guys come from a culture of
shoot first, respect later. Nick is, on
the outside, mild-mannered as mur-
derers go. But when someone pushes
the wrong button, that someone gets a
bullet. Or two. ‘Or ten. His friends
aren’t fans of such behavior, but they
don’t question the motives either.

This becomes a problem when
one of the old bosses disrespects the
kids and Danny (Frank Vincent),
Nick’s uncle, by storming out of the
meeting where the young guys lay out

 

their plan to receive
financial backing.
At first, this isn’t
that big of a deal -
if the scheme works,
there will be more
money for everyone
else. But when the
plan does work, and
the old man comes
looking for his cut,
things become 
tense. He abducts ~
and attacks the guys
with the plan, much 5 5
to the chagrin of the‘
temperamental
bunch. The twenty-
something mobsters
decide to bump him
off, but the old guys
will have nothing of
it. Jimmy (James
Caan) is the sort-of
big boss who tries to
explain to the boys
the virtues "of respect. But such
virtues, and listening to their elders,
aren’t their strong suit. ‘'5 .
In a way, the film presents a cul

ture clash: the Sopranos bumping
heads with the Corleones. And this
conﬂict makes the film wildly inter-
esting and entertaining. When it
comes down to it, the ‘crime doesn’t
matter all that much.” It’s pulled off
without much difficulty, and it quick-
ly becomes secondary to the charac-

ters. The crime only exists to present
the conﬂict between the young and
the old.

It doesn’t hurt that the acting is
excellent. Everyone involved, from
Provenzano to Vincent Pastore in the
role of a strong—arm nightclub owner
— a role he’s rapidly becoming type-
cast in — and Edward Lynch, who
seems to be channeling every insane-
aspect of Willem Dafoe’s look and
acting as the Santini’s hitman to Caan

and cliches

and Pastore, knows the material and
the territory well — probably because
most of these guys have been making
such movies for decades. And when
the always entertaining Pat Cooper
enters the film, all too brieﬂy, the
film soars to new heights of enjoy-
ment. s

But the film, at times, buckles
under the weight of the script, a
screenplay heavy with mob cliches
and unmotivated, angry swearing.
These things wouldn’t be so bad, but
they just run rampant throughout the
film. These elements are so prevalent
that, at times, they knock the viewer
out of the ﬂow of the film by making
them wonder, “Was that really neces-
sary?”

The acting and conﬂict, though,
are strong enough to make “This
Thing of Ours” an enjoyable film. It’s
the first directorial effort from Danny
Provenzano. And while still a bit
rough, his View of the world is there,
and it will only get clearer and sharp-
er in the years to come. This film
could be the first from someone with
an altogether new take on a_ tired
genre. ’

“This Thing of Ours” opens at The
Oaks Theater in Oakmont-on Friday.

Panthers 

Sophomore receiver and Heisman
trophy finalist Larry Fitzgerald has
been named Division I-A Player of the
Year by the Eastern College Athletic
Conference. ’

Fitzgerald’s latest honor makes him
just the second Pitt player to win the
ECAC award, along with fellow.receiv-
er Antonio Bryant in 2000.

Fitzgerald, who became the first
sophomore to win three regions in the
Heisman V-oting race, also won the
Walter Camp Player of the Year and the
Biletnikoff awards and was named Big
East Offensive Player of the Year.

In 2003, Fitzgerald set two NCAA
receiving records, including consecu-
tive games with a ‘
touchdown catch

The Panthers (1-1, 1-0 in the Eastern

should’ make one request
of the NFL franchise in
Philadelphia.

His request should be
that the team change their
name to the Philadelphia
McNabbs. When I heard
this from my friend’s
younger brother while
watching last weekend’s game, I
thought it was funny, but after giving
it some thought; it kind 'of makes
sense.

After all, without McNabb, the
Philadelphia Eagles would have gone

nowhere this season. Isn’t this the

same guy that Rush Limbaugh, who
knows nothing about football, claimed

got undeserved " credit for
Philadelphia’s success?
According to Limbaugh,

McNabb’s performance had nothing to
do with the Eagles’ success over the
past few years.‘McNabb was able to

McNabb N  1  I.

 
 

take advantage of the
media’s desire that a
black quarterback do
well.

Well, McNabb and all
of his blackness has sin-
gle-handedly led his
team to the NFC
Championship.’
Philadelphia. was -2-3
through its first five
games, and everybody wanted to
bench him. Through those five games“

 gs

he threw two touchdowns, as .com- '

pared to five interceptions.
_ There was one problem —
McNabb was hurt, and not everybody
can perform hurt like Tennessee
Titans’ quarterback“ Steve McNair.
That’s why McNair was a co-MVP
this season, but playing hurt should
not be expected from every athlete.’
‘McNabb weathered the storm and
led his team to a record of 10-1 ‘over
their final 11 games. During that
stretch, McNabb threw for 2426

yards, 14 touchdowns and six inter-
ceptions. ' _

» The argument that McNabb is just
another Kordell Stewart is ridiculous.
First. of all, the argument around
Pittsburgh is that Steelers’ quarterback
Tommy Maddox is

believe that, then thereis no way that

' McNabb is another Stewart because

you can’t compare Maddox to
McNabb. It’s ridiculous. _
McNabb can make plays out of
nothing, sort of like Stewart could.
Maddox is done as soon as the pocket
collapses. In the Eagles’ victory over
Green Bay last weekend, McNabb was
able to shake off Packers’ defensive
linemen Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila and
Grady Jackson and hit Todd Pinkston
in the end zone to bring the‘Eagles
within three points of the Packers.
After a last-minute drive that
ended in a game—tying field goal, Brett

Stewart. If Steelers’ fans want to,

What’s wrong

with making
easy money?

 

Since this seems to be theweek
for scandal in _sports, I figure it’s
about time for me to join the fray.
Because, throughout _the Bowl
Championship Series debacle, the
numerous dubious NFL coaching
decisions, and the strange and
incomprehensible ranking system of
NCAA basketball, I’ve been harbor-
ing a terrible secret of my own con-

cerning the long—awaited Pete Rose

confession. 9

I ,don’t see what is so wrong
about betting on one’s own team.

I understand that it’s taboo and
that Bud Selig doesn’t like it and all
that, but, ethically speaking, what is
it about gambling in favor of your
team,that makes it so problematic to
adrnrit Rose to the baseball Hall of
Fame? 

:Forget for a minute that the cur-

rent ‘HOF hits leader, Ty Cobb, was’

not ‘bnly a gambler, but also a mur-
derer and an all-around terrible
human being. Let’s just consider
Rose’s infractions alone. ,

Gambling against one’s team’——
which Pete Rose vehemently denies
— is certainly wrong, because you
can affect the outcome in a manner
other than you would normally. By
throwing the game, you cheat your
teammates, fans, employer and
opponents out of the fair competi-
tion they are promised.

But what, exactly, is lost by bet-
ting on -one’s own team? 'You’re not
trying any less hard to win. If any-

thing, you’d be more focused on the .

game and more competitive.
Winning‘ at all costs has been par for
the course for many coaches and
players for so long now that it’s hard
to imagine how that could be con-
strued as a negative in sports.

WVU head coach kicks
leading scorer off team

MATT STANMYRE
The Daily Athenaeum (West Virginia U.)

(U—WIRE) MORGANTOWN, W-.Va. —
Drew Schiﬁno’s playing days in
Morgantown, W.Va., are ofﬁcially over.

West V1rginia’s leading scorer was dis-
missed from the team by head coach John
Beilein for violation of team rules.

“After meeting with my staff, we felt
this was the decision we had to make,”
Beilein said. “Due to federal privacy laws, I
carmot discuss personal matters related to
student-athletes publicly.”

Schiﬁno said he would seek a transfer
immediately. The former junior swingman
said he has not sought out, nor received,
transfer interest from another college or uni-
versity. Schiﬁno also said he would “deﬁ-
nitely stay‘ at a Division-I school.”

Beilein’s dismissal of Schiﬁno is the
culmination of six tumultuous days.

According to Schiﬁno, he was initially,

suspended for one game (Georgetown)
because of comments he made to reporters
following a Jan. 7 loss at Notie Dame.
When interviewed after the loss to ﬂie
Fighting Irish, Schiﬁno told The Dominion
Post, “I didn’t play a lot I didn’t get many
shots. It’s not a selﬁsh thing, but I averaged

me to score. I can’t get my shots.” /

Upon learning of his suspension for the
Georgetown game, Schiﬁno said he skipped
practice later that day, prompting his indeﬁ-
nite suspension on Jan. 9.

Then came Schiﬁno’s oﬁicial dismissal
Monday, which according to Beilein was

made after much deliberation among the

coaching staff. However, Beilein’s com-
ments on the situation remain vague.

“Thisisnotaﬁmthing‘todo;thisisa .-

terrible thing to do,” Beilein said Monday.
;“We’re very conﬁdent that this move is best.
It was no longer right for [Schiﬁno] here.”

Schiﬁno, on the other hand, has been '

much more vocal.
“I asked him what his reason [for the
indeﬁnite suspension] was,” Schiﬁno said
“[Beilein] didn’t really give a reason.”
Schiﬁno also alleges that Beilein failed
to punish other players for more detrimental
behavior, and that teammates informed
Schiﬁno that Beilein said he wasn’t a team
player when Schiﬁno wasn’t around.
Beilein was unable to be reached for
comment. He did, however, say that -the
team was polled in regards to Schiﬁno’s sus-
pension, but that the ﬁnal dismissal decision
was made by the coaching staff alone. 2

Nocks, page 14

Favre gave the Eagles a late
Christmas present by throwing the
ball up for grabs in overtime. Brian
Dawkins ‘ picked off the ball and
returned it into Packers’ territory,
which set up kicker David Akers’ win-
ning field goal.

Without McNabb, this would not
have been possible. For that matter,
the Eagles are a 6-10 team and miss
the playoffs, just like their Western
Pennsylvania counterparts. Let’s face
it, Philadelphia is not a very good
team, but somehow it managed to reel
off nine straight twins en route to its
third NFC East title in a row.

"Philadelphia uses three running
backs, but none of them have been
able to distinguish themselves enough
to be named the. outrightstarter. The
Eagles’ wide receivers are average.
The factor that balances the equation
is McNabb.

_In order for the Eagles to make it
to the Super Bowl, McNabb is going
to have to have a bigigame. They can-
not depend on Carolina Panthers’
kicker John Kasay to miss three field
goals and an extra point like he did in
the two squads’ meeting earlier this
season. i

I am one of those people who

McNabb is only playmaker-

thought Philadelphia would be one-
and-done in the playoffs, and they
would have been, had Favre made a
wiser decision. The key to the
Panthers advancing to the Super Bowl
is to make sure that they do not allow
the Eagles to hang around too long.

Green Bay was inside of the
Philadelphia 10-yard line twice within
the last 35 minutes of the game and
came away with only three points.
Had the,Packers been able to put away
the Eagles earlier in _ the game,
McNabb would be sitting on his couch
along with us this weekend watching
the Conference Championship games.

Carolina cannot afford to allow
Philadelphia to hang around. It also
must force running backs Steven
Davis and DeShaun Foster down the
Eagles’ throats, because Philadelphia
cannot stop the run.

One playmaker and a terrible
defense, which was ranked 20th over-
all this season, are not a good recipe
for winning a championship, so
Carolina has to step up and prevent a
potential Philadelphia Super Bowl
appearance. But it starts with coming
in with a solid game plan to shutdown
No. 5.

are on a professional baseball team.
You also have a sibling who is on
one, and you two are scheduled to
meet in a one-game playoff to deter-
mine the final wild-card playoff
berth. You call up your sibling and
say: “Hey, winner of the game gets a
bottle of champagne from the
other?” Your sibling, being healthily
competitive and believing in his or
her team, agrees.

Would anyone be appalled to
hear that? Repeat the last paragraph
with, instead of a bottle of cham-

pagne, a hundred bucks, less than the
retail value of a nice bottle of Veuve
Clicquot. Still no real problem,
right? Neither of you is promising to
hedge performances or affect the
outcome of the game other more
than you would normally. You’re
just putting stakes on your perfor-
mance.

Let’s put it another. way. When
Bobby Knight, an ethically question-
able man, failed to lead his Texas
Tech basketball team to success last
year, he gave up his salary, saying
that his performance had not been
worth paying for. What is that but a
bet with his employer? How many

contracts are littered with “incen-
tives” for sustained or excellent per-
formance? How are those anything
other than legal betting for an ath-
lete? It’s essentially the team owner
saying “I bet you won’t play 130
games this season” or “I bet you
won’t be an all-star,” and putting
hundreds of thousands of dollars on
It.

Are stock options for CEOs
bets? They can affect the perfor-
mance of the stock. How about pay-
ing on commission? Tips for servers
or drivers? We would say: “Of
course not, that’s just capitalism.
Payment based on performance. So

with the $08 website and technology issues)
Interviews will be held on Jan. 24Ih&25th

shall ye work, so shall ye eat.” In
fact, if a baseball player were to sign
a contract based entirely on his per-
formance — x number of dollars per
home run, y number of dollars per
RBI, etc; — he would be lauded for
being unselfish and fair to a level
never before seen in professional
sports. Seeing -a pattern here?

Some people have suggested to
me that the problem is that he had an
effect on the game whereas the other
people gambling did not. This makes
no sense to me on three levels‘.VOne,
if someone’s bet was based on
whether he was trying to win, then
nothing changed, because he was
already trying to win — it’s not like
he would affect the game more
because he bet. Two, gambling is
inherently based on the premise that
you know something the other bet-
tors do not. Three, even if, somehow,
his behavior could be construed as-

. unfair to others betting on the same

game, unfairness to gamblers is not

cause to be kept out of the Hall of

Fame.

Rose said in his autobiography
that he gambled because he didn’t
think he’d get caught, not because he
thought it was okay. Well, why isn’t
it okay? Because it’s technically ille-
gal? Shall we start making a listof
professional athletes with criminal
records that are still eligible for the
Hall?

When someone can tell me
where the line is between those
examples and telling a man with a
book that you’re so confident in your
team you’re willing to put your daily
salary on it, I’ll join the petition to
keep Rose out of the ‘Hall. .Until
‘then, I’ll keep waiting for the all-
time hits leader in baseball to join
the pantheon in which he belongs.
