Teachers To
Confer On

Economics

School teachers and adn1in-
istrators will attend meetings
and a conference at the Uni-
versity today to learn about
rationing, price ceilings, and
other economic controls of the
government, Dr. E. W. Jacob-
sen, dean of the,School of Ed-
ucation, announces.

Sponsored by the Ofﬁce of Price
Administration and called by them,
the conference will be directed by
Dr. W. W. D. Stones, professor of
education and director of curricu-
lum planning. Students at Pitt and
Carnegie Tech will attend the con-
ference.

The schedule of meetings in-
cludes: school teachers and ad-
ministrators registered in the
course, “The High School in War-
time,” 8:30 to 9:30, 324 Cathedral;
other teachers and administrators,
10:30 to 11:30, Foster memorial

Students who began graduate
study before September, 1936, and
who have not obtained a waiver
of the Statute of Limitations are
asked to call at the Graduate
Office, 2101 Cathedral of Learn-
ling, before the close of the Six-
Weeks Session. This does not ap-
ply to candidates for graduate de-
grees in August.

auditorium; and conference in the
Curriculum Laboratory, 1:30 to
3:30.

In all probability, E. H. Redford,
a representative of the O.P.A. Edu-
oational Relations branch, will at-
tend the meetings.

Chief purpose is to acquaint
teachers with information con-
cerning price ceilings, rationing,
and other economic controls neces-
sitated by the war so that they
can pass on such information to
the communities.’ Since teachers
now serve on rationing boards, it
is important, O.P.A. oﬂicials state,
that they understand reasons and
methods for such regulations.

All classes in education at Pitt
from 10:30 to 11:30 have been dis-
missed so that students may attend
ﬂue 10:30 to 11:30 meeting. Dean

that is not concerned with an isolated item of news, but is rather a"
synthesis, in retrospect, of important developments in Washington

that are related to higher education.

This story is an attempt to coordinate the results of the recent 3 
conference of college presidents held in Baltimore with what has been _ ‘ I

going on at the capital.
It is editorialized in that it will try to interpret for students not

acquainted with these developments, what has been happening during ‘ . 

these all—important past few weeks.

History

Last Janu'al y ‘the National Conference of College and University,

Presidents held an emergency session at Baltimore, its ﬁrst following
the outbreak of war. _

The University was represented by Chancellor John G. Bowman,
then-Provost Rufus Fitzgerald, and Dean of the College Stanton Craw-
ford. -

At that time the conference adopted resolutions favoring:

. 1. Allocation of the country's total manpower.

2. Acceleration of higher education programs.

3. The government's giving some sort of ﬁnancial aid to the uni-
versities in order that they might turn out more men trained in the.
professional and technical ﬁelds for the emergency.

‘ This set of recommendations was turned over to the office of the
US Commissioner of Education, John W. Studebaker.

9

From Studebaker’s office of education, the problem of the colleges it * A

and the war went to Paul V. McNutt’s War Manpower Commission.
McNutt’s commission, advisory in nature, realizing the need for

professionally and technically trained men as it was pointed out by V

the January conference at Baltimore, had a bill introduced in Congress

calling for $5,000,000 for loan-scholarships to students in engineering

and scientiﬁc ﬁelds. The bill was passed‘ by Congress, and McNutt’s
commission, together with the oﬁice of education must now come to
some sort of agreement as to how the money will be administered.

A government release of July 17, tells that such plans are being!
worked over by theoﬁice of education and will soon be submitted to
McNutt for approval by the War Manpower commission.

However, only one day before the release was sent out by the gov-
ernment the Baltimore conference convened again, this time to protest
against what they called “inadequate acceptance of proposals made by
the January conference.”

What is important here is that the educators, who must have known

that they are to get the ﬁve—million dollars, still think that an inade- ‘

quate amount to handle the problem. The conference, among other things,
predicted a twenty-ﬁve per cent enrollment drop in the fall, which they
called “a national crisis.”

And these educators think that, even with the ﬁve-million dollar 
appropriation, the government still isn’t doing enough to help alle-«A,
viate what may develop into the crisis they predict. This brings the f

history of the government-colleges relationship up to date with the
government giving ﬁve-million dollars and educational leaders point-

ing out that this isn’t enough—-and that not only more money, ‘but.
more planning and more governmental coordination must soon be forth- ,

coming, by this fall, if possible. Either that or a national crisis.

The Baltimore Conference

Called together by the American Council on Education, seventy-ﬁve
officers of universities, colleges, and technical schools met recently at

Baltimore and discussed what higher education should be doing in the

war. . .
Highlights of the conference were the following four recommenda-
tions made to the government by the university representatives:
1. A reminder to federal officials of their inadequate acceptancelof
proposals made by higher education at Baltimore last January, pro-
posals which would lead to the development of plans providing for “a

continuous and adequate supply of men and women trained in technical "

and professional skills and in leadership to meet both immediate and
long-range war needs.” .

2. A renewed insistence upon the immediate need for a coordinated,

comprehensive plan by federal authorities to utilize the many essential

types of advanced training provided by universities, colleges, and schools ‘

of technology.

(Do not read this ed2'—to1z'al until after you have read the front
yge story on the government and the colleges.) '
vWhat has’ happened at Baltimore this past month, the
government subsidizing education to an ever-increasing~de—-
gree, marks the beginning of total education on a long 'rai'i‘ge
scale. For it has shown that schools and colleges run as 
American industry, on a "private enterprise, laissez-faire: basis
Jiave thus far failed in carrying out their part of the tremen-
dous 'manpower allocation program of which it should and
‘must be a vital part. a V » «
.  They have failed because: ' ' " ’

. 1. With admission based largely on economic factors,
rather than on native intelligence and ability-——the schools
now ﬁnd that the thin top strata is rapidly being depleted
of men——and that from the huge numbers of America’s white-
collar and" industrial worker families must come many of
America’s future collegians. There’s goingto be a 25 percent
enrollment drop next fall, unless something’-s done, andvthat
enrollment drop, with its resultant effects upon the numbers‘
of army officers available and number of men available for
industry and the professions may well be a national crisis.

2. The selection of army officers and personnel for other
etter posts with the armed forces go largely to college men.
And educators themselves admit that this is at best “an un-
democratic procedure,” since the ﬁnancial ability to go to
ollege is in no way an indicator of ability or intelligence.

   

- And the government realizes that there is much more
that education must do. Thegovernment also realizes that
the schools are not to be condemned too severely, that they
'3 cannot be divorced from the economic system of which they
_are,a. part_——that the coming failu-re of the schools to pro-
duce large numbers of trained men represents some inherent
fault in ourpresent economic. set-up, a set-up which accepts_
.,the postulate that the ability to pay tuition, rather than the
potential ability to serve society decides whether or not a man
'1‘ woman is able to go to college.

0 ~ The government now realizes that education can no long-
 considered a function of the individual——-but must be
thought of in terms of the group. In other words, you are re-
eeiving aneducation not primarily for your own benef‘it——but
 that you may contribute something to the society of which

it will be in the future no one is able to say.

_ ‘But the whole idea of being educated to take your part
in a direction and not for any selﬁsh, gain—motivated, purposes
is back of the new government subsidization program.

A .—Here’s why. There should be 160,000 people entering
college this fall. This is the minimum requirement if we are
0 have enough trained men and women to carry on effective
avar. But due largely to economic reasons only 120,000 plan
0 enroll. We are forty thousand short. We are short because
our social and economic systems restrict those going to col-
eges to the top economic’ levels. And the dangers of such a
ractice are just being shown. ’ ' .

- But now the government has said that unless some plan
is devised so that those 40,000 get to go to school, you and I
and every one of our friends and teachers and parents-will
” ﬂ’er..Therefore whether or notvthe 40,000 are educated is
as much our problem and concern as it is theirs. '

But this isn’t a new idea. A lot of people have thought
about it and worked for it and got kicked around for believing
it. Funny, though, what happens to people’s “deep seated
prejudices” and conventions and attitudes when they get
scared. At losing a war,for instance. . ‘

SPORTS EDlTOR

 

Today’: guest column is written by ]erryrRipp, Pitt News sports
writer. Previous to this Bud Hendel, Michigan Daily Sports Editor,
¢n¢l',}.'Ifldo Icardi have contributed columns.

Pitt News sports editor Alex Zelenski was last seen picking his
teeth with a student directory wondering whom to ask for next
week’s column, and shrieking to himself, "No sports this summer!”
"No sports this summer.”’) '

Word comes to us from Canton, Ohio, that Johnny
“Lefty” Brown, who played ﬁrst base for Pitt during the
past. two seasons is going great guns as an outﬁelder for the
Canton Middle Atlantic League club. Brownie always had the
makings of a topﬂight slugger and yet his career at Pitt brings
forth one of the most amazing slump. stories in local diamond
annals.

In 1941 as a sophomore, Brown won the first string ﬁrst
baseassignment and kept it throughout the season despite
the fact that he ended the season with a batting average of
only‘.083. T

This past season Brown again was the regular

Thus, in the space of one season,Brown raised his average
over 300 points, which is sensational in any league, be it the
college loops or the Friday evening church league.

What caused “Lefty” to go from one extreme to the oth-
er? Had he changed his batting grip ? Perhaps he stood further

‘ A back in the batter’s'box or he placed his feet differently. We

know that he did none of these things. Instead he was the

V same Johnny Brown that had batted .083 just a year before.

Batting slumps are something that the greatest base-
,-- ball minds have tried to explain for years without any sem-
blance of success. However, one thing is known: When a
player ﬁnds himself in a protracted batting slump he begins
to press. This only leads him further into the depths of his
slump. He starts hitting at balls that he ordinarily would let
- go byplnvariably his ﬁelding also falls off. His mind is so
occupied by ways and means of curing his lack of hitting that
in the ﬁeld he is thinking of batting all the time instead of
following the ba-ll.
Then one day he comes to bat, sees a “fat” pitch coming
‘up, gives it all he has, and the slump is over. He has ﬁnally
come through with a real hit. The batting slump has ended as
mysteriously as it began.
The greatest of ball players go through the agonies of a
batting slump. Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Babe Ruth, Joe Di-

-’Maggio, Ted Williams—they’ve all gone through those tor-

turous weeks of a hitting slump. They’ve all felt the wrath of
the fan who pays his dollar and dime and is entitled to “ride”
the player. And “ride” the player he does.

Just recently the Boston fans so upset the temperament-
al Ted Williams, slugger deluxe of the Redsox, that he. was
lifted from 3 game by Manager Joe Cronin. This was follow-
ed by a dressing down administered by Cronin in front of the
entire Boston team‘ because of Williams’ failure to keep
hustling despite the vocal outbursts of the fans. .

Joe DiMaggio, adjudged to be the greatest player of the
present era, has been in_ a slump throughout most of the pres-
ent season, and he too has been hearing the “advice” of the
bleacherites. It happens to the best of them. O

Thus it was with Johnny Brown. Today he’s a star with a

A], class C professional club, just a short way from a berth with
-Igsome big league outﬁt. And yet two seasons ago he hit .083

nine.

Johnny Brown will run into many more batting slumps

By ROBERT COOK

Hidden away in the southwest
corner of the twenty-sixth floor of
the Cathedral is one of the most re-
markable and complete private col-
lections of old and rare textbooks.

The collection of 4,400 books in-
cludes a few texts of European
origin and many first editions of
American printing.

“Starting with an old textbook
that I found in an abandoned school-
house in the backwoods of West-
moreland county eight years ago,
I began to collect old American
textbooks as a hobby,” explained
Dr. John‘ A. Neitz, professor of
education, owner of: the collection.

Dr. Neitz says that his hobby
has educational as well as profes-
sional aspects. It has stimulated
his teaching of the course he offers
in the history of education in the
United States.

The displaying and the discussion
of the books enables the student to
visualize the contemporary condi-
tions of the schools, the content
and methods used in the books.
Graduate students are aided be-
cause they have primary materials
from which to write theses and dis-
sertations. In its professional as-
pect, Dr. Neitz sells duplicate’
copies of first and second editions.

Recently, Thomas Jarrett, Uni-
versity photographer, photograph-
ed several of the books and many
picturesque and interesting pages
converted the negatives into lan-
tern slides. Dr. Neitz uses these
slides for student and public lec-
tures.

The oldest piece of printed ma-
terial in the collection is a one page

Dean's Daughter

Funeral services were held last

Mrs. Graeflt‘ died suddenly last
Wednesday morning in St. Joseph's
hospital, Lexington, Ky., where her
husband was engaged in govern-
ment work.

A graduate of the University,
Mrs. Graeff was a member of Kap-

Dr. Neitz’s Collection of Rare American
Books Found To Be Stimulating Hobby

DR. NElTZ’S
‘‘I found an

-primer, entitled “Tabuna ABCD-
ARIA Pueriles.” The page primer,
printed in Roman and Gothic let-
ters, is the forerunner of the horn
book. The page was printed by Val-
entin Babst of Leipzig, Germany,
in 1549. Today the page is sold for
$40. When it was printed it sold
for 121/2 cents. ,

The horn book is interesting as
well as valuable. When sold at an
auction three years ago, the book
was valued at $600. The book is
of European printing of 1650 and
is missing the letters J and U. The
American pewter adaptation of
1729 contains the previous miss-
ing letters.

C0 LLECTION
old textbook”

Standing out as the most popu-.\
lar American textbook of the last
generation is the McGuﬂ’ey reader.
By 1834, McGuffey had written and
published his third edition of his
primer.

The years following, many other
editors and publishers revised his
reader and issued it as their pro-
duct. A total of 120 million copies
of the work have been sold. Last
year in the state of Virginia 270,-
000 copies were sold.

In Dr. Neitz’s office, one can see
a complete evolution of textbooks
from the one page primer of 1549
to the ﬁrst editions of our modern
day.

continued from page one

3. Assuranc_e_of necessary adaptation by the institutions of pro-
grams and facilities to train students for war service.

4. Reference ‘to the democratic shortcomings of present procedures
For voluntary enlistmentand training of college students, which “pro-
vides only for those young men who can afford a college education or
{who can secure assistance under existing ﬁnancial aid conditions."

ln short the schools pledged full cooperation with the war effort-—
but insisted upon further government aid to carry out its plans.

A partial list of the resolutions passed by the conference and sent
on to Washington follow:

1. We deplore the continuing lack of any adequate. coordinated plan
for the most effective utilization of higher education toward the winning
of the war, and we urge the establishment of such a coordinated. plan
at the earliest possible moment.

'2. The government is not utilizing the institutions of higher edu-
cation to capacity and is, therefore, impeding the flow of highly trained
manpower essential to victory in a long war.

3. Through the provision of year-round instruction and many other
recently adopted changes, higher education has demonstrated its readi-
ness to devote all its facilities and energies to the war effort. However,
the lack of any adequate, coordinated plan has given rise to widespread
confusion among governmental agencies, educators, students, and the
general public. This confusion constitutes a serious barrier to the full
wartime utilization of higher education and hence to the successful
prosecution of the war. ‘

4. To insure more ‘effective utilization of the facilities of higher
education through the establishment of a coordinated plan, we recom-
mend to the Secretary of War, the Secretary of Navy, the director of the
Selective Service System, and the chairman of the War Manpower
Commission that immediate steps be taken to assure eﬁective and con-
tinuing cooperation between the agencies they represent and higher

‘education.

5. Among the premises upon which such a coordinated plan should
be based are the following: .

a. The function of higher education is to provide the nation with
broadly educated and highly trained men and women. This permanent
function must be continuouslyperformed lest the health, safety, and wel-
fare of the nation beendangered; but in the present grave crisis the
winning of the war must have right of way in higher education as well
as in all other national undertakings.

b. To develop breadth of understanding, stamina, and qualities of
leadership is a major function of higher education. These are essential
characteristics of good officers in the armed forces. It is signiﬁcant that
although only 12 per cent of the men already inducted into selective serv-
ice have had college training, 80 per cent of the men selected for officer
training in the army have been chosen from this group of college men.

c. Present plans for the voluntary enlistment and training of col-
lege students provide only for those young men who can ﬁnance a college
education or who can secure assistance within existing ﬁnancial aid pro-
grams. Large numbers of qualiﬁed young men are, therefore, barred from
bpecial types of training. Such a situation limits the supply of broadly
educated ofﬁcer material and denies to many young men equal oppor-
unity for training. Economic status, race, or creed should not be al-
lowed to restrict the training of adequate, skilled manpower at the col-
loge level for the war program.

6. The proposed coordinated wartime plan for higher education
should be established at once so that, with the opening of the fall terms
in 1942, the institutions of higher education of the country can throw
 entire resources into the VII’-O"Ol‘C.‘
