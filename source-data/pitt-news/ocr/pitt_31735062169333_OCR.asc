UNIVERSITY or PHTSBURGH

Discuss University
At Tap Day Banquet

Dr. Abe Laufe, professor of
English, and Mahmood Mamdani,
senior political science major, de-
livered addresses to the Tap Day
Banquet audience Wednesday.
Mamdani spoke on the necessity
of universities’ taking an. active
role in the society of which they
are a part, and Dr. Laufe dis-
cussed the education one receives
outside the classroom.

Dr. Laufe stated that whereas
Commencement is “a necessary
evil,” and Scholar’s Day indicates
“those who have a 4.00 quality
point average,” Tap Day “is the
most important day,” because it
“emphasizes that which is not
gotten from books or in the class-
room.”

“The trouble with What stu-
dents are taught in the class-
room,” said Dr. Laufe, “is that
we teach students what to think
but not how to think.”

Students are deﬁcient, he con-
tinued, in the ability to “think,
reason, and analyze” problems.
They must learn to seek both
sides of a problem, and in order
to do this they must “learn todo
research.”

Dr. Laufe cited the case of the

book by William Manchester,

Death of a. President, in which
the various parties involved and
also "outside parties claim differ-

‘ ent versions as the truth. —

“If the only thing a student
gets out of a college education,”
maintained Dr. Laufe, “is from
the classroom and out of text-
books, then he is an educated
fcol.”

Students must learn to “get
along” and acquire some “social
graces," neither of which can be

 gotten out, of a textbook.

Dr. Laufe advised students that
they must learn to “meet compe-
tition,” and that it takes leader-
ship to rise above the crowd. He
attributed high drop-out rates, a
large number of transfers, and
student dissatisfaction to the fail-
ure of students to equip them-

selves sufficiently to meet com-
petition.

He said that students “have to_
be aware of what’s going on in
the outside -world.” Dr. Laufe
cited the Debate Union as typify-
ing the idea of complete student
av;-reness, since it is necessary for

debaters “to be able to think on.

their fee .” '

Dr. Laufe concluded his ad-
dress by reminding his audience
to be “kind to people you meet
on.your way up because they Will

\be the same people you will pass
on the way down.”

Mamdani stated that “the uni-
versity is a most powerful insti-
tution in the society and today
this institution is not equal to

honoring student leaders, emphasized that improvements .-
and advancements can be made at this University with the ‘
cooperation of an enthusiastic student ‘body and student 

leaders.

‘Manning advocated courage for students and iadminiys-g 
trationi “The University of Pittsburgh is replete Withcow-‘ H’
ards,” charged Manning. He ﬁrst stressed the character- \
istics of the capable student leader. 3 "

“A student leader must have ingenuity and courage. He must —‘~1i- 

work with all groups and must communicate the demands of those
he represents to the administration and’ faculty. His aim is to raise
the status of the student to a position of respect in the University

community,” explained the speaker. _ y.
Criticizing apathy and hypocrisy, Manning asked for the enthusi-
astic participator and leader. Manning also deplored the use of ad- :

visors as decision makers in student activities, insisting that the stu-

dent body should not permit this.

University Releases Policy
For US Draft Requirements

The Registrar’s Office has
recently released the follow-
ing information informing
"students ‘of administration
policy on complying with Se-
lective Service requirements
and the reasons for the policy.

In order to obtain a deferment,
a student must be in full time at-
tendance and must be making
progress toward a degree. His lo-
cal draft board should be inform-
ed of his attendance at the be-
ginning and end of each aca-
dcmic year. To facilitate this, the
University has provided Selec-
tive Service Form 109, with reg-
istration materials, for under-
graduates, and Selective Service
Form 103 for graduate students.
The local board must also be
notiﬁed immediately of ‘a stu-
dent’s withdrawal, resignation,
suspension, dismissal or gradua-
tion. '

To remain eligible for defer-
ment a freshman must rank in
the upper one-half of his class, a
sophomore in the upper two-thirds

and a junior in the upper three-

fourths. Graduates must rank
in the upper one-quarter of their
graduating class. Class rank is
determined by the cumulative
quality point’ average as of the
close of the winter trimester. ,

The second criterion for judg-
ment is the Selective Service ex-
amination which is given at vari-

ous times throughout the school‘

year. Presently, if a student ful-
ﬁlls either the rank in class re-
quirement or the examination
score, his deferment will be con-
tinued. Officials point out, how-
ever, that if the manpower sit-
uation becomes more critical,
both an eligible test score and
satisfactory rank may be re-
quired.

The University’s involvement

with the draft requirements cen-

ters around the registration form, »

Selective Service 109. This form
offers the undergraduate stu-
dent’s rank in class and his status
at the University, and gradua-
tion information. When the card
is returned with the registration
kit, it is forwarded to the stu-
dent’s local draft board. Should
a student desire that this infor-
mation be withheld from his
draft board, he must send a .re-
quest to the Office of Students,
G-60 CL.

The issuance of this informa-
tion to the local board is not an
arbitrary action on the part of
the University, but is done [at
the request of the student. One
must realize, however, that if
the University withholds this in-
formation, the local "board would
have no basis to extend defer-
ment. This would leave the board
no choice but to reclassify the
student 1A.

While discussing the adminis-

public student criticism, who are
afraid to take a public stand, on

Citing examples, Manning in- . 
cluded changes in cafeteria serv- 5

\ice, the room rent increase, and

the unreasonable policy in the
book‘ center concerning the re-
turn of books. Manning suggest-
ed that fraternities could im-

. prove by deferring rush. He add-

ed that the administration did
not inform students of the dan-
gers of drugs, which, he felt is
their responsibility.

Lack of leadership in the fac- 

ulty, remarked Manning, is also
a flaw at the University. “Often

silent and unorganized, they have _.

failed to come to the aid of the

students on important issues that ' V

affect our lives .at the University.”
However, an exception /to this

ﬂaw was the Frick Fine Arts

crisis, he said, there courage and
strength were forceful. “Faced

with the choice between millions V

Obscenity Over Censorship

y LEWIS M. TAFFER

In a parliamentary debate
sponsored by the William
Pitt Debate Union (WPDU)
a standing room only crowd
voted 78 to 30 for the Gov-
ernment resolution that
“This house prefers ‘all-kinds of
obscenity _to any kind of censor-
ship.”

The WPDU was host to two-
visiting British debaters, Pamela
Margaret Ings, and David James
Fletcher Hunt, as they teamed
with Mahmood Mamdani and Ar-
mand Belly, respectively. Mam-
dani and Ings supported the gov-
ernment resolution while Belly
and Hunt opposed the proposal.

After tracing the origin of ob-
scenity to the. Greeks and the

* suffered from the

Jews of Palestine, Mamdani sup-
ported obscenity for three basic
reasons. First, Mamdani claimed
that our society, through its vast
bureaucracy, has become “gear-
ed to the status quo,” rejecting
such works as Lysistrata and
James J oyce’s Ulysses as obscene.
Second, he maintained that ob-
scenity was _“in the eye of the be-
holder" and that one’s judgment
as to what is obscene is almost
always ethno-centric. Third, he
supported obscenity as “fun.”
Hunt, the ﬁrst speaker‘ for the
government and its supporters
opposition, countered that the
government and its supporters
“intoxication
of the female breasts.” He sup-
ported censorship on the grounds
that if no limits existed,‘ obscen-
ity would become commercialized

LSD Debate Continues

Leary Is   Leader

by STEVEN A. BOOKSHESTER
‘(Editor’s Note: End of
two—part series.) ~
WASHINTON, D. C.
(CPS)—-The debate over the
use of LSD continues on
numerous college campuses,
and it takes place on many

different levels. One aspect

of the LSD controversy is the
drug’s supposed ability to pro-
vide religious experience.
Timothy Leary, one of the ear-
ly researchers on LSD at Har-
vard University, has founded a
religious cult based on the drug
experience. He calls it the League
for Spiritual Discovery (LSD).
Speaking last weekat the Uni-
versity of Oregon, Leary suggest-
ed, “When you turn on . . . you

go . . .
when you go out of your mind,

you come to your senses, you?

resurrect your body, you discover
that you are two billion years
old.”

In this manner, Leary, who was
dismissed from Harvard for his
drug experiments, said, the in-
dividual who takes LSD is link-

ing himself with the stream of‘

life since the beginning of exis-
tence.
During a mid-January speech

' at Stanford University, Leary ad-

vised students to ﬁnd their own
LSD-based religion. “Everyone of
us has to be his own Moses, his
own Galileo, and work out his
own system with Caesar,” Leary
stated. “The kingdom of God is
within your own body.” _
Another January speaker at
Stanford, Dt'.iAllen Cohen of the

University of California at Berk-'

eley, disagreed with Leary’s ana-
lysis of LSD’s spiritual powers.
Cohen who at one time worked

_ with Leary, charged that LSD is

a “fake.” . -

A 30-time‘ user of the drug,
Cohen claimed LSD “did not de-
vc-lop me spiritually and had no
application to ‘everyday life.” Co-
hen said the drug, which he stop-
ped taking a year and a half ago,

out of your mind. And '

in

leads to\ “spiritual egotism with

— users -extending egos rather than

transcending them.” _
Another debate over LSD cen-
ters around its reported "ability
to stimulate creativity. A Stan-
ford University study by Drs.
Willis Harman and James Fadi-
man reported recently that “giv-
en appropriate conditions, the
psychedelic agents can be .em-

ployed to enhance any aspect of .

mental performance.”

The subjects of the experiment
produced a new conceptual mod-
el of a photon, a design of a
linear electron accelerator beam
"steering device, av mathematical
theorem regarding NOR-gate cir-
cuits, and several innovations in
architecture and design.

The report states, “The psyche-
delics appear to temporarily in-
hibit censors which ordinarily
limit’ the mental contents coming
into conscious awareness.” "

A study by John C. Lilly of the
Communication Research Insti-
tute, Miami,_ claims that LSD
frees man’s “human computer”
from many limitations. The study
suggests that LSD’ gives individ-
uals the opportunity to look at
themselves comprehensively, al-
lowing for serious introspection
not normally possible.

Other reports disagree with
these ﬁndings, and there is a con-
ﬁict over the side effects, of LSD
use as well. _

Food and Drug Administration
officials claim that at least ﬁve
per cent of individuals using LSD
experience serious psychological

“Cause”

sources range upward from one
per cent. ,

A draft of an unpublished study
done recently at a large Midwest-
ern university eomments, “Sci-
entists measure and have ex-
planations for the actions of
many drugs on such observable
indices as the heart and respira-
tory rates, the level of various
chemicals in the blood, and the
secretion of enzymes.

“In contrast, the subjective
changes produced by a drug can
be ascertained only by asking the
subject, in one way or another,
how he feels.”

The ‘report states, “To be sure,
one can measure the drug’s effect
on certain measures of psycho-
logical functioning —the ability
to perform some standardized
task, such as placing pegs in a
board or remembering nonsense

A syllables—but this does not tell

us what the drug experience is
like.”

Drug psychoses, the unpublish-
ed study says, may arise from
'1e deﬁnition by a user of cer-
tain unusual symptoms the in-
dividual chooses to associate with
his drug use.

The individual umy interpret
these symptoms “to mean that
he has lost his grip on reality, his
control of himself, and has in
fact ’gone crazy.”’ At that time,
the report suggests, “the drug ex-
perience, perhaps originally in-
tended as a momentary enter-
tainment . . . looms as‘ a momen-
tous event which will, disrupt
one’s life in a possibly perma-
nent way.”

with injurious effects upon chil-
dren.

Miss Ings retorted that censor-
ship in today's world is about as
anachronistic as “the chastity
belt in the age of the acetylene
torch.” In regard to children, she

maintained that there is no proof -

of obscenity’s harm to children.
Furthermore, she found censor-
ship abhorrent because humans
are fallible and capable of being
in err, and that once started, li-

censed restrictions may become x

unstoppable, pervading other fac-
ets of life. A
The opposition closed its case

‘as Belly indicted obscenity and

“filth” as being all-pervasive, con-
stantly working to “destroy the
fabric of our society.” Belly found
the only" salavation for this di-

lemma in the teachings of Jesus‘

Christ as interpreted by the South-
ern Baptist Church. He closed by
stating the only way to stiﬂe the
“Communist, existentialists, and
free-lover” who V promulgate the
current wave of smut is through
this Southern group.

ecko and Joe Kociubes, have re-
cently placed third in the Navy

The United States Infor-

story of the U. S. to the
World ~ and an University
alumnus speaks for this
agency. Leonard Marks, re-
cipient of three University de-
grees, was named USIA director
in 1965 by Lyndon Johnson.
A close friend of President
Johnson, Marks handled the prob-
,.lems'for the Johnson family’s ra-
"-éio network in Austin, Tex., for
nearlyi20 years. He also super-
vised radio and television pro-
gramming for John F.. Kennedy
in the 1960 campaign and again
for Johnson in 1964. After the
1960 campaign, Kennedy asked
Marks to serve as incorporator of
the pioneering Communications
Satellite Corporation. He served
as a director of COMSATl until
his appointment as USIA direc-
tor in 1965.
 Marks came to the University
i on a scholarship in 1931 follow-
ing his graduation from nearby
Schenley High School. He wo-rk-
ed his way through school selling
/“_7,3rograms at football games, wait-
"ling tables at the Shrine temple,
and grading papers for profes-
sors. At commencement cere-
monies in 1935, Marks ranked
ﬁrst in his class, graduating sum-
ma cum laude.

As for extracurricular activ-
ities, Marks was a member of the
staff of the Pitt News, managing
editor of the Owl, and staff mem-
ber of the old Pitt Panther, a
humor magazine that continued
publication until the early 50’s.

I - Kappa’ Theta

Pinochle Played For Charity

The Phi Kapp’s are about
to make history and anyone
with one penny to donate to
Children’s Hospital can help
them. ,

In search for something uni-
que to draw donating observers
to their annual charity drive, the
64 brothers of Phi Kappa Theta
seized upon the idea of a pi-
nochle marathon. Marathons are
famed events in many college his-
tories—from goldﬁsh swallowing
and showering, to drumming and
cross-country bed rolling, but as
far as the brothers can discover,
theirs is the ﬁrst pinochlle mara-
thon in the long history of mara-
thons.

This one is different, however,
because it requires student and
outside support to make it a suc-
cess.

(EDITOR’S NOTE: Although
there is an article on Manning’s
address on the front page, we
feel that it was of sufficient val-
ue that it should also be printed
in its entirety.)

by RALPH M. MANNING

TODAY WE are honoring
students who have displayed
leadership on this campus. I
have chosen to _speak on the
topic of leadership as it per-
tains to students, to the ad-

' ministration and faculty, and

to the community around us.
First, let us look at student
leadership at Pitt.

Some have tried to deal
with the problems of leader-
ship. as it relates to other
problems at other. campuses
across the nation. But I be-

‘ lieve that it is of primary

importance to look at our-
selves as a separate unit, be-
cause there are problems

_ here which are unique to the
.University of Pittsburgh. It
’ would be easy for me to

mouth generalizations about
what a student leader must
be-. We all have heard them
before. A student leader
must have integrity and
courage. He must work with
all groups and must com-
municate the demands of
those .he represents to the

I -administration and faculty.

His aim is to raise the status
of the student to a position
of respect in the University

, community. But on this day

and before this audience,
speciﬁcs will be of more val-
ue. There is an all-pervasive
apathy at this Universtiy.
Activity after activity hun-
gers for participants, but
rarely do any come forward.
For the past several years,

 the majority of students

have chosen to put all the

power of student leadership

into the hands of the few.
THESE SAME students

V who have abdicated this pow-

er simultaneously complain

 that the school is run by a

clique.’ The only other active
group, besides the few stu-
dent leaders, is a dissident
minority which prefer to talk
rather than act. They rare-
ly come forward to join
hands with the elected lead-

" ers for common goals. And‘

what about some of the stu-
dents who have achieved ma-
jor leadership roles. All too
many have chosen to sit on
their titles of supposed im-
portance. These leaders have
permitted their once power-
ful and meaningful offices
to become ineffectual waste-

‘ lands which can never recov-

er their former roles on cam-
pus. But what about the mo-

"tivations of those few who
have worked — and worked-
‘ hard. Have they really been

concerned with the improve-

‘ ment of University facilities

and services?

Or has self -gloriﬁcation
been their primary goal? As
I. try to answer these ques-
tions, I think back to the re-
cent Student Goverment cam-

T paign. A Pitt co-ed approach-

me, exclaiming that she

 .» would ‘never be selected into

the Owl ‘Hall of Fame, be-
cause she had openly stated
her beliefs about one of the
candidates and was being cri-

 ticized. She was on the verge
of denying her beliefs with

the hope of protecting her

[ reputation. Nothing could be
. more poignant proof that-
' the honorary system should

be radically changed on this

so that student activities
would be lead by students
who enjoy them and who
want to cont-ribute to their
University and society.. The
type of hypocrisy this co-ed
demonstrated infuriates me.

HOWEVER, IT, is time we
all realize that there is a
little of this hyprocrisy in
all of us. We must realize
that.this is a human ﬂaw
that will never leave us com-
pletely. It will always be in
the back of the mind of every
student leader, What must
not be tolerated on this cam-
pus is the type’ of person
whose actions are constant-
ly determined by thoughts
of self-advancement and in-
creased personal prestige.

There are“ those of you
sitting out in the audience
who are being honored for
the ﬁrst time today. You
will direct the fortunes of
the student body in the up-
coming years. We have
spoken about apathy, about
the leader who accepts his
role only for self-advance-
ment, and about the essen-
tial qualities of the ideal stu-
dent leade-r. In the next few
moments I will-try to dis-
cuss your relationship to the
administration, the faculty,
and the community at large.
These are ultimately the
most important relationships
because working by ourselves
in a vacuum we can accom-
plish nothing.

IN MANY cases the ad-
visors to student organiza-
tions serve as the ﬁrst link
between the students and the
other parts of the Univer-
sity. However, there have
been some notable failures
in this area. It is the duty
of the advisor, as the name
implies, to counsel. But what
do we ﬁnd in many cases?
We ﬁnd the supposed stu-
dent leaders ever turning to
the advisors to the extent
that the advisors, not the
students, make the decisions
for the student organization.
Why does the Student Union
Board have no duly elected
student chairman? Do the
students sit as a panel un-
der the control of their ad-
visor? If it is so, then it is

-impossible for a student to

perform in his proper ca-
pacity or to receive a val-
uable learning experience
from his extra-curricular ac-
tivities. The unfortunate
thing is that usually the
real fault lies with the stu-
dents for permitting the sit-
uation to arise. .

As we look around the
University and try to seek
out the problems facing those
who direct our education, we
ﬁnd one central fault: the
University of Pittsburgh is
replete with cowards. It is a
cowardly act to hide behind
a regulation and, “It is so, I
can do nothing.” There are
many here‘ who are trying
to hide in such a manner.
There is no place at any
University for administra-

. tors who refuse to face the

students, wh-o refuse to hear
public student criticism, who
are afraid to take a public
stand on an issue-—right or
wrong.

ADMINISTRATORS WHO
deal -with student problems
cannot and must not hide
from the students. And when
they face the students, they
must have the courage to
defend what they have done.

ness .Affairs, and Auxiliary ‘

Manning’s   Tap Day Address

ten acted in an clandestine
manner, refusing to hear
student ideas at various lev-
els of the decision-making
process. Anyone who doubts
the truth of this statement
need only look at the changes
in the cafeteria services, the
room -rent increase, and the
unreasonable policy in the
book center concerning the
return of textbooks.

Let us look to other areas
which suffer from this cow-
ardice. As a fraternity man,
I have observed undue op-
position to certain changes
which could be of beneﬁt to
the students. The adminis-
tration has constantly re-
fused to face the reality that
a. deferred rush would in-
evitably strengthen the sys-
tem. With this change,‘ men
would be able to build a ﬁrm
academic base in their ﬁr‘st
term,, and it would provide
opportunities for the men to
investigate all the fraterni-
ties carefully.

WHY HASN’T there been
an open dialogue on this
issue? It is their role to en-
courage this type of debate.
rather than suppress it.

There has also been cow-i

ardice on the part of the ad-
ministration concerning the
problem of drugs. This prob-
lem must ultimately be put
at the feet of the Student
Health Service. We see pos-
ters displaying vultures who
warn us not to smoke. But
where are the posters, where
are the leaﬂets, where are
the pamphlets that inform
us about the dangers of
drugs? How many students
know the potential dangers
of pep pills, stimulants, mari-
juana, and LSD? This is an
unforgiveable cowardice that
must be corrected. .
But the students should
not feel that all administra-
tors have closed their doors
to the student leaders. Chan-
cellor David Kurtzman is al-
ways willing to meet and
talk with representative stu-
dent leaders. When the Uni-
versity was in the midst of
the state-relation crisis, Dr.
Kurtzman came to the stu-
dents in this room in an
open forum to answer any
questions we had about the
fate of our institution. Re-
establishing a long dead tra-

' dition, he met with the stu-

dent leaders on a regular
basis. Never resentful or de-

.fensive, the Chancellor wel-

come all the information and
opinion the leaders had to
offer.
YOU WHO will be leading
the students in the next few
months will have honest,
young, and dynamic admin-
istrators to work with -
Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
Chairman of the Board of
'Trustees William Rea, and
Dean of Student Affairs Jack
Critchﬁeld. '

Another area in which we
have seen a lack of leader-
Ship is the faculty. Often si-
lent and unorganized, they
have failed to come to the
aid of the students on im-
portant issues that affect
our life at the University.
There are several competing
pressures which explain this
phenomena: the importance
of research, public and pri-
vate; the need to publish;
and involvement in off-cam-
pus‘ activities. University
professors across the nation

are now indulging in mass‘

displays of collective indig-
nation. They question _the
' ' » *h ads of our

   

      

  

    

. Valley.”

‘The

government to lead our so-
ciety. And yet they readily
forget it was their responsi-
bility to educatethese men.
Perhaps these professors

should ﬁrst realize that they

were often too busy to be
concerned with building the
total individual when they
were intrusted with his edu-
cation. There are now begin-
nings which promise involve-
ment by the faculty in stu-
dent problems. The Faculty
Committee on Student Af-
fairs, headed by Dr. Robert
Agnew, has shown that it
has an -honest desire to learn
of the students’ needs. We
only hope that the faculty
realizes that they are begin-
ning a task which should
have commenced with the
founding -of this institution.

WEHAVE spoken of. cow-

ardice in the University. But.

there have been a few rare
moments where we have seen
courage and strength in re-
cent days. One such instant
was the heroic stand taken
by the University in the
Frick Fine Arts crises. Faced
with the choice between mil-
lions of dollars of endow-
ment or the possible loss of
our integrity, the adminis-
tration stood ﬁrm and re-
fused to accept badly needed
funds.

However, I feel that the
Frick case is the exception
to the rule. Many members
of the Pittsburgh commun-
ity have devoted time to the
University. But even though
they have shown dedication
to our institution, we must
question the foresight and
vision of some of these com-
munity leaders. Recently the
retired chairman of "the
Board of Trustees, Gwilym
Price, said in his ﬁnal ad-
dress to the University that
the “new goal for the Uni-

versity should be to make

Pitt a really ﬁne regional
University, serving south-
western Pennsylvania, Penn-
sylvania, and the Upper Ohio
How much _more
narrow, how much more in-
breds, how much more pro-
vincial a viewpoint could one
take? Obviously Dr. Jonas
Salk did not feel that the
borders of the University
ended with this region.

' HIS CONTRIBUTIONS
and the contributions of

others like him show that

many members of the Uni-
versity community have not
permitted themselves to be
stiﬂed by such a limited out-
look. If the community con-
tines to be under the sway
of this mind-set, then it is
the duty of the students and
administration to" show the
fallacies of. this type of
thought. We must demon-
strate to the citizens of the
Pittsburgh area that we have
a role to play which goes be-

yond the tri—state area. All
too often when we have
needed aid, we "had to ap-
proach individuals who at-
tended other institutions. We
must realize that a strong
and active alumni will be the

lifeline to University growth.

It is ‘ironic that we have
such poor alumni support,

since so many of them live
in our own community.

We must face the fact that

there has been a growing
alienation between the Uni-

. versity and the alumni in re-
cent years. Now it is time.

to ask why there has been
this deterioration. We can
not accept this situation as
being a result of some gen-

 

eral policy that the Univer— '

sity has put forth. We be-
lieve that this originates
with the unending little ag-
grevations that all of us have
suffered during our time at
the University. When in-
voices come late, when girls
are unjustly campused, and
when secretaries treat you

with disrespect, it is no won- A"

der that many students leave
the University disgusted.

Their reluctance to contri-5
bute to Pitt is understand- ‘

able. -

WE HAVE‘ cited many
problems which face the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. None
that we have discussed are
unsolvable. A student lead-
ership of quality will be our
real source of strength. And
a leadership of quality will
he courageous leadership. We
are ﬁrmly. convinced that a

responsible student leader.

must be willing to study and

criticize every aspect of col-_.-

lege life that affects the stu-
dents. The ideal student lead-
er will be responsible, not
because he has been told to
be, but because he is seri-
ously concerned about the
University and its problems.

' His voice may be softer than

some of his more vociferous
counterparts. The responsi-
ble student leaders are those
who speak with reason,
knowledge, and authority.
The success of ‘a student
leader, then, depends to a
great degree on his recogni-
tion of student problems and
on his ability and courage to
solve these problems in face
of whatever opposition is put

before him. Of all of those,

who have tried to articulate
this point, John F. Kennedy
put it best: “In whatever
arena of life one may meet

the challenge of courage,

whatever may be the sacri-
ﬁces he faces if he follows
his conscience——the loss of
his friends, his fortune, his
contentment, even the es-
teem of his fellow men —
each man must decide for
himself the course he will
follow.’’

Should Exams

Be Announced?
Editor, The Pitt News:

I have been at this University
for two years and have suffered
through quizes, mid-terrns, and
ﬁnals. Unbearable as these things
were, they all had one thing in
common; they were announced,
i.e. I knew when they were com-
ing. Now, a certain geography
teacher has added a major i11no-
vation to the armals of education,
the “unannounced major exam.”
I suppose he-rationalizes that all

 Letters to the‘Editor

his students have to do is re- s

View their past lessons every
night before every class, and they
will be prepared for whatever he
wishes to throw at them.

But perhaps he doesn't or won’t
realize how much time it takes
to review three and four weeks
work, to say nothing of the pres-
sure that is going to build. And
even  the students do have the
time and superior intellect to
absorb new material and review
the old every other night, they,
as members of this University,
have a right to know when their
knowledge will be put to the test.

‘ I'm sure a few students in this

class are on scholarships, near
probation, or on probation; this
cannot possibly help them in any
way. . '

If the teacher was truly inter-.
ested i.n helping his students, he
would realize this; but he hasn’t.
It is taken for granted that a’ uni-
versity must retain certain auto-
nomous characteristics in order
to run efficiently, but these char-

acteristics do not give an instruc-~

tor the right to put an unreason-
able burden on a person when
his future is at stake.

I doubt if there are any aspir-
ing geographers in my class, and
if there are, I wish them well. As
for myself, I will have to ‘be a
realist, suffer along with every-
one else, do my work, and take
whatever grade I earn. But some
night if you are studying for a
test, don’t feel too bad; there are
about 200 other people studying
for something they don’t know is
coming.

ECONOMICS HONORARY

Omicron Delta Epsilon, na-
tional honor society in econo-
mics,‘ has elected the following
students to membership for the
academic year 1967-68: Diane
M. Hergenroeder, Janet T. No-
biolo, Peter L. Felber, George
W. Ruccio, Kenneth L. Samuel-
son, and RobertA.Uhl.>

A minimum QPA of 3.0 in
economics and 3.0 over-all
QPA are the qualiﬁcations for
election into ODE; economics
majors and non-majors, who
have completed 12 credits in
economies are eligible.

\

And when those lucky 200 re-
ceive their grades, maybe they
will be able to point with pride
at their geography grade, but the
others—skip ’em brother, or vice
versa. As I said before, we’ll
have to play along. But should
we be forced into this.

Decision Time
For Theater

.. Editor, The Pitt News:

Agreed: now. is the time that
decisions about Pittsburgh's the-
atrical policy are being made. Let

us hope that the decisions made‘
at this time will lead to the es-'

tablishment of a progressive resi-
dent professional ‘company at the
Playhouse. To infer that the dis-
missal of John Hancock has end-
ed this hope, as have Messers.
Olshavsky and MacLeah, is ab-
surd, for the Playhouse under his,
management has been neither
professional nor progressive. Goe-
the wrote that the theatre that
ignores the demands of its audi-
ence cannot long endure. This is
not to say that the audience de-
mands to see only trash or that
the audience is too stupid to un-
derstand Mr. Hancock’s genius.

It means that the. audience de-
mands to see a competent han-
dling of the play on a wide range
of levels of appreciation. The au-
dience does not wishgco see either
a dull performance or one which
is no more than a series of the-
atrical “ins.”'Then, to treat said

‘ audience in a high-handed man-

ner for not appreciating either
the uneven quality, the dullness,
or the “ins” is hardly to be call-
ed professional. If the theatre is
tc- be nothing but boredom and
cliche, it is difficult to call its
condition progressive. ’
Therefore, let us hope that the
board, in planning the future‘ of
the Playhouse, shows less con-

cern for flash and more aware-
ness of intelligent basic theatrical

Pitt Basketball

Editor, The Pitt News:

As an alumnus of the Univer-
sity (College—l-951, Law—_l954,
active member of the Varsity
Lettermen’s Club, varsity basket-
ball manager 1950-51) and reg-
ular attendant at nearly all Pitt
home athletic events, including
basketball, I would like to add
my comments to those which
have appeared in the Letters to
the Editor column concerning the
basketball situation at Pitt. »

First off, I _am in complete.

agreement with the views ex-
pressed by’ Robert Schwartz, a
graduate student, in which he
called for the dismissal of Bob
Timmons as basketball coach. I
think Mr. Schwartz correctly ana-
lyzed the deplorable state of Pitt
basketball. A new coach is deﬁn-
itely absolutely essential if Pitt
basketball is to ever apprecia-
bly improve. At this point, let
me say that I am not a late ar-
rival on the “get-rid-of-Timmons”
bandwagon. I have been saying
precisely the same thing for the
past eight to ten years. I have
written innumerable letters to
Athletic Director Frank Carver
and have had conversations with
him in which I have urged the
dismissal of Timmons, all to no
avail. A

change. However, I have noticed
a deﬁnite groundswell of opinion
within recent weeks among the
students and even some alumni
which would indicate that inter-
est in Pitt basketball is not dead.
On the contrary, I believe there is
a potentially great desire among
Pitt fans to see the University
achieve respectability and even
greatness in basketball, just as
there is in football. However, I
am convinced that this desire can,
only be realized if a sufficient
number. of the student body as
well as alumni will forcefully ex-
press themselves.

Knowing Mr. Carver as I do
(for a period covering almost 20
years) he is not the sort of man
who will do anything unless he
is forced by student, alumni, and
administration pressure to do so.
For my part, I intend to keep up
the pressure through_ alumni,
particularly Lettermen, pressure
as best I can. But I can’t do it‘
alone. I, therefore, urge The Pitt
News and all students who sin-.v

the challenge of academia’s val-

He explained that “since the
university cannot escape being
politically involved and impli-
cated, I believe it should feel
obligated to be more responsible
——to its own stated values and to
the basic needs of the community
which supports it.”

Continuing, he said that “the
community which supports this
university is at this moment fail-
ing to cope with itself—either as
an individual community or as a
great power in the world com-
munity.”

Mamdani declared that “there
is a crisis in society,” citing the
Harlem and Watts riots, and civ-
il rights turmoil. He said that
"the crises cannot be met by ac-
tivity from those places in so-
ciety where power is already con-
centrated. For democracy cannot
be made real, that is, people will
not be actively responsible for
power, and power will not be
centrally responsive to the hu-
man needs and values, until peo-

ple outside the power structure
discover their potential power
and begin to use it. That is why
the students, a marginal group
in society, outside its mainstream,
were the prime initiators of the
civil rights movement.”

He added that “the task of in-
tervention for democratic values
and change in the one going un-
done by the university. And that

is the task which must be done‘

if the university is to be of basic
service to the community.

“It is the duty,” he said, “of
the university to incite in the
student an awakening that there
is a world beyond that of the
classroom. The university will
have failed in its duty if it doesn’t
provide to every student an ori-
entation to involvement.”

Mamdani stated that “the ad-
ministration should be remolded
into what it ought to be, a data-
collecting, fact compiling agency.
Decision-making power must es-
sentially return to where it be-
longs and to whom it affects-—
the faculty and to some degree,
the students.”

«T NSA-CIA Controversy

 
  
   
   

WASHINGTON, D. C.
_ ‘J - (CPS) —The president of the
‘I National Student Associa-
 tion (NSA) has criticied a
J, White_House*inquiry into
' . Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) financing of private
organizations.

W. Eugene Groves told a
press conference here that

-appointed by President John-
-son, could be cditical of the
CIA since it includes intelli-
gence agency director Rich-
ard Hehns.

Other members of the fact-ﬁnd-
ing board are Undersecretary of
State Nicholas Katzenbach and
John Gardner, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
_ Groves said that he found past
__ contacts between NSA and the
CIA completely unjustiﬁed. The
NSA president speciﬁcally refer-
red to the passing of informa-
_ tion between members of the stu-

dent group’s International Com-,

he did not see how the panel -

mission and CIA agents in pre-
vious years.

He repeated an earlier call for
a Congressional investigation of
the use " of private organizations
for the purposes of American
foreign policy.

Said the NSA official, “The re-
velations of the past week have
shocked the world, to the extent
or jeopardizingmuch of the pro-
ductive work undertaken to build
international understanding and
of undermining the trust placed
in Americans worldng overseas.”

He said the use by the CIA of
covert means in domestic groups
to build democratic institutions
“reflects a monumental contra-
dition in the construction of
American society.”

Groves said that “while the
NSA has been and remains anti-
Communist, the world now knows
that the United States has em-

ployed many of the same secre-

tive techniques to ﬁght represen-
tatives of a closed society that
those societies use themselves."

’ Edward Schwartz, NSA’s na-
tional affairs "vice-president, com-
mented, “Those who--think that
NSA will roll over and play dead
as a result of last week’s disclos-
ures ure plainly misguided.”

He said no schools had disaﬁ‘i-
liated from the student group
since ‘Ramparts magazine dis-
closed NSA’s links to the CIA,
and noted that Michigan State
University, Lewis College (Lock-

' port, Ill.), and the University of

Denver had joined the organiza-
tion during the past two weeks.
Among. numerous statements
of support, Schwartz said, had
been messages from educators
Harold Taylor and Harris W of-
ford, labor leader Victor Reuther,
economist Robert Theobald, and
poet Alan Ginsberg. ,-
The N.SA vice-president en
erated present and future nation-
al programs of the association,
calling them “the most dramatic
campaign for student services,
student rights, student involve-
ment, and student power” under-
taken in NSAfs,20—year history.
Schwartz asked for the general
public “to lend the independent
ﬁnancial support which has been
so difficult to obtain in the past.”

John Loch and Assistant Director
Miss Harriet Friday. In its term
of office, the new SUB hopes to

“plan a greater variety of activ-

ities and programs that can be
of interest and service to the
entire campus community. The
idea of a “university union” and
not just a “student union” will
be stressed.

One of the main objectives of
the SUB will be to become more
commuter‘- oriented. Realizing
that a lack of facilities leads to a
lack of ‘personal identiﬁcation
with the school, the Board hopes
to introduce more daytime recre-
ational and educational events
for commuting students.

In the coming fall term, the
insitution of the University's SU
will be 10 years old. The plans
for a ‘week—long celebration are

Franl{ Carver Rules

His Nest With Smile

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

All’s quiet on the Western front today. That is the way
Athletic Director Frank Carver likes it and that’s the way
it usually is up on the Hill. '

Carver is one of the nicest men you would ever want to
meet. He guides his -department, not with an iron hand, but
with a benign smile. It’s not one of those come—one—come-all
' smiles, but instead it wisps aroundthe cor-
ner of his mouth.

The curl in his lips has shortened re-

3 cently because it’s difficult to smile and
‘worry at the same time. It’s too bad that
Carver" has to worry because he’s one of
those men that deserves the best from life.
i{ I _ But fate hasn’t been so generous. He is
i_ ‘ h the guardian of a glorious football tradition
A .  —a tradition which started to fade several

‘ years ago. '

You could watch him during the away football games.
Watch him cup his hand underneath his chin. Watch the
redness creep slowly over his expression. The tinge repre-
sented that of -one slightly tipsy or highly embarrassed. It
probably would have been a great deal easier for him if he
had been slightly tipsy. - I s

' For he was watching the Panthers ‘being humiliated, of
Pitt being humiliated, of himself “being humiliated. It’s not
that bad when you lose 20-18, but 40-0 or 56-13?

It must have been tough to be patted onthe back and

be told that your boys tried hard and next year you’ll bounce

a back. It must be tough to sit in an office rimmed with pic-
tures of Pitt All—Americans an-d then try to deal with the
present.

His office seems to be always open. He takes pride in
the type of athletes at Pitt. His -brightest moments are
those when visited by a former letterman who is now a doc-

’ tor, dentist or lawyer. _

He’—d rather talk about the athlete that plugs than the

one that flasehes. He wants the solid citizens, the ones that
1 will represent Pitt with pride and not endanger its reputa-
tion with silly antics. ‘

When he starts to talk you immediately’ feel that he’s
taken you into hisconfidence. He’ll tell you what Pitt used
to be like. How it was a poor boys’ school with kids scrap-
ping for an -education.

Then there are the problems of the present. Whenever
you delve into problems you have to come out a little dirty,
a little frustrated and a little disgusted. '

First there was a ‘football coach—one of those really

nice guys who knew how to grin and bear it. People were
pressuring, Carver consented and Johnny Mike left. Then
there was a track coach. A coach that was doing more harm
than good. It took several years but Carver ﬁnally accepted
his resignation. Then there was a swimming coach who had
ceased to be effective. .

Now there is basketball. A change is obviously needed,
but when it will come is another question. In times like
these it’s unfortunate that Carver is one of the nicest guys

It didn’t" matter how, much
Carnegie Tech prayed to win

last night, because for once,
at. least, the Panther basketball

team wanted a victory and play-
ed appropriately. The cagers
stiﬂed the underdog Tartans, 69-
55, in Tech’s Skibo Gym.

The win was their sixth in 24
games, with one contest left in
the long season. Miami of Ohio
(13-10) entertains the Panthers

Tech opened up quickly against
the cagers’ man-to-man d_efense,
scoring their first six points on
driving layups, and for a while,
it looked as if the Tartans.were
going to get the win they've been

after for 12 years.

But the Panthers kept their
poise and fought back to ‘tie the
game at 20 with seven minutes
in the half. Then Pete Smith

Cold Shooting Freshmen

“Down E<venColder Tech

by MIKE BROURMAN
The freshman cagers and
the Tech JV’s displayed
equal ineptitude in getting
the ball in the basket from
the ﬁeld, but the frosh were

more accurate from the foul line,
and thus managed a 49-41: vic-
tory over the Little Tartans at
Ski-bo Gym on Thursday night.
“I think we must have. shot
about 10 per cent out there,” said
frosh coach Tim Grgurich. Ac-
tually the Cubs hit on 28 per
cent, their worst night of the
year. Fortunately, the Little Tar-
tans were even more myopic,
hitting a mere 25 per cent.
Grgurich believes that the two
statistics are related. “We just
seem to play up to our competi-
tion. Every time we’ve played a
good team, except for the one
Duquesne game, we’ve played
well. Other times we just don't.”
Actually, the Cubs started out

' as if they wer‘e‘”going to have one,
of their better days. Seven steals.

and some‘ good early shooting
propelled them to a 20-4 edge
midway through the ﬁrst half.

Then Grgurich removed the
ﬁrst team, and Tech began a
comeback, narrowing the gap to
26-14. The starters quickly re-
turned, but whatever drive they
liad was gone. ~

“I might have taken them out
to soon,” Grgurich admitted, “but
I wanted to give everyone a
chance to play. They may not
get to against Point Par.” The
first half ended at 30-18.

The second half was marked
by long periods of time when
neither team could put the ball
in the basket. Before Paul Napon-

Tech was only slightly-more pro-

made the score 36-29.

It was four minutes later be-
fore the next ﬁelder was scored,
again by Naponick. It gave the
frosh a 39-33 edge.

“When you start missing you
start taking quick shots,’.’ Grgu-
rich explained, “and that’s how
you go cold.”

While the Cubs were scoring on
foul shots, Tech wasn’t scoring
at all. The Little Tartans went
seven minutes without a point.
“It’s a good thing we played
some defense because, that’s all
that saved us,” Grgurich said.

to have greater and greater importance. But be-
cause the mermen don’t know what Air Force’s

stroker can do in the 100 yard leg of the medley,
the relays shape up as “blind” events.

  iIniTwilightiof semi, 
Stan Falenski Remains

As Basketball Enigma

by GEORGE LIES, Assistant Sports Editor

Hidden away in the far dark corners of the Fitzgerald
Field House, is the answer to the.Stan Falenski riddle. Some-
day it will come out in the open.

His story is oneiof discouragement and disillusionment.
It is reeked-with disappointment. It-begins like a torch.

In the beginning, he was a.
Pennsylvania Basketball All-
Stater from r Derry Area High.
Tagged as one of the state’s ﬁn-
»-est players ever, he came to Pitt.

Because he had the best moves

' around the basket in high school,

he played the pivot. But the six-
foot one-inch freshman was soon
switched to the guard position.

He was groomed to play guard
_in his sophomore year ‘by head
coach Bob Timmons. “I was ﬁrst
string as a soph, but I found it
hard to. adjust to college play,”
Falenski said.

“I hacLa real good year as a
"freshman, but that doesn’t prove
anything,” pointed ‘out Falenski.
“The difference between fresh-
man and varsity basketball is
like night and day.”

Timmons realized Falenski had
the jitters. He had both Roth
McNally and Larry Szykowny for
the guard spots. So he moved the
ill-fated soph to a forward posi-
tion. ‘ -
Then -it happened. Falenski be-
came academically ineligible af-
ter the seventh game. “I missed
quite a bit of experience, 17 or
18 games,” noted Falenski.

“I think Timmons expected a
lot from me,” he said sadly. A

That was a long year for Stan.
It was even longer for Timmons
because the Panthers ﬁnished
with seven wins, 16 losses.

Intermittent rays of bright light
sparkled on his junior year. The
teamstill lost three times more
games than they won. But noth-
ing stopped Falenski from play-
ing this time.

“Last year Larry and I work-
ediout real well,’’ he said. “But

The “real “well” effect wore-off
in this his senior year, although
he did “expect a half decent sea-

Falenski, but it happened again.

This time he broke training
rules. He was suspended from
the team. “Things were pretty
bad,” said Stan. “But I kept prac-
ticing at the YMCA in case I
could play again.” And he did.

After losing to all seven of
their Eastern league oppon-
ents, the gymnasts apparent-
ly have little—or-no chance of
finishing anything but last
at the Eastern Champion-
ships today and tomorrow. The
host team, Springﬁeld College is
currently in ﬁrst place, followed
closely by Penn State, Temple,
and Army. —

The only real hope that the
gymnasts have is Dave Shideman-
tle. Last year as‘ a sophomore
Shidemantle was the ,Eastern
champ on the long horse vault
and ﬁfth in the country. ‘How-
ever, because of an injury in
last week’s Temple meet, Shide-

phatically expressing, “That’s
the trouble with everybody. They
are always, comparing us to some-
one else or last year or even last
week‘. I like to look ahead to the
next meet‘ and leave the past
alone.”

The future, coach Warren Nei-
ger admitted could possibly be
worse than this season which
was the worst in history. Vfith
the graduation of Ig Perez and

"Jim Sacco, and only promising

freshman, Denny Ricard, Shide-

1antle’s optimistic views will
have to be subdued for at least
two years.

Shidemantle Will not be eligible

The only other gymnasts with
a chance to represent the Uni-
versity -at the nationals is Jim
Sacco. Sacco has ﬁnished sixth in
the all-around division for the
past two seasons but is ranked
ﬁfth this year. Since only ' the

top four gymnasts go on to the
nationals, Sacco has only a slim
chance of placing. Sacco admit-
ted, “The ﬁrst three places are
pretty much wrapped-up but I
have a chance to ﬁnish fourth.”

Last season the gyrrmasts ﬁn-

ished ‘last in the Eastern league‘

and are going into today’s meet
solidly entrenched in the cellar.
Unfortunately, there is only one

sity which means that the gym-

scientists — and for top graduates in’

economics, business, law, account-

ing and the liberal arts. "

feel cramped. This is a worldwide

company, and it makes over 200,000
different products. So there's plenty
of room‘ to feel your strength — and
in some of today's most -challenging
fields: transit design, urban lighting,
jet propulsion, computers, elec-
tronics, aerospace, you name it.
Challenges like these have raised
a new generation of idea men at
G.E. If you're good enough to join

come to you early. Your talents are
recognized, your work is rewarded
