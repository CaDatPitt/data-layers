Fourteen Pitt st_udents‘have been
ordered to vacate the Lothrop
Street houses they rent by Jan. 1
because the , University Health
Center, Inc., plans ‘to raze the
houses .to build parking ‘lots.
Donald L. Mackey, of Gardner‘
Fisher, Inc.‘ Realtors, sent a notice
to the tenants‘ of 245, 247, and 251

Lothrop Monday that informedthe

renters they must move from the
houses within 90 days. The notice
stated:

“We regret very much- that this
notice to move fromyour house has
This is
your formal 90-day 7 notice to

move....Once again, ‘we are very
sorry about this" notice."

The leases for the three houses 1

contained a special clause that
allowed the University Health
Center to require the tenants‘ to
leave after 60-day notice was
given: " ‘

Henry J. Smith, ﬁnancial ofﬁcer"

for the University Health Center
in ‘the
Lothrop and Darragh St. area
knew the housing there would not’
be permanent. - '

“We plan to tear three of four
houses as we can do it,” Smith
said. “Little by little, we will be

probably,

‘ tearing them down_ and will
continue this aslong as there are '

houses standing on Lothrop and
Darragh.” '

Mark Brody, of 247 Lothrop
Street, one of the houses to be
demolished, said the realtor who
rented them the house this summer
led them to believe the house
would not‘ be touched for the next
‘few years. Becausethey believed
they would be livingthere during
their ﬁnal‘ two years of dental
school, Brody and‘ his roommates

' repainted the house and carpeted

the hallways.
Brody and ‘his roommates gues-
tioned Mackey about the 60-

-day clause when they rented the

house this summer. _

“Mackey told us the house
would be here‘ for. four or ﬁve years,
” Brody said. “We
believed him because he gave us
about $200 worth of paint to re-do
the house.”

Markey denied he ever told
Brody and his roommates the
house would be there four or ﬁve
years. _

“That is not‘ true,” said Markey. _
“I told everybody the same thing.‘ I
told them I didn’t‘ know when it
would be torn down. ‘I said it could
be one or two years, or it could be a
month.” -

Prof Claims Meddling in

By MICHELLE WEDDINGTON

Foreign imperialism and inter-
vention has become a major
problem in Africa, according to Dr.
Ladun Anise, a doctor of political
science and Nigerian native.

“Some African leader invite
military intervention to further their
own selﬁsh needs. Other Africans
will be used to do the work."
Anise said. ’

Wednesday during a weekly
program by Pitt’s International
Development Forum of Indepen-
dent Study.

According to Anise’s article,

“Where Angels Fear To Tread,”
“These days no foreign power
intervenes in Africa without some

’ ‘invitation’ to do so by some African

head of state and some nationalist
group. Jealousy, and rivalry among
African states add to the vulner-
ability of black Africa.”

“The central issue in Africa is
racial oppression; all others will
come later,” he said. “Not just
from western countries, but also
from within itself.” -

Soviet Union, Cuba, France and
America play a large rolein military

 SGB Allocates Emergency Funding

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer
The Student Government Board,

’ rejecting two separate recommen-

dations from the Allocations
Committee, Wednesday voted to
give WPGH radio $5,400 to begin
repairs to its carrier current
broadcast system.

WPGH had requested emergency
funds last month as general
manager Jeff Couch told the Board
the station could remain on the air
for only one month unless_repairs

_ s were implemented.

After Couch’s request, the SGB
began cutting its own budget by as
much as $5,700, redistributing the
money to other student organiza-
tions, WPGH receiving first prior-
ity. ‘ 1

But the Allocations Committee;
last week discovered a $6,500 deﬁcit

built up by the Owl/Yearbook and

the Franklin Pangbom Film Soc- -
,al1ow- broadcast to the Quad,Vthe

iety budgets. Mike Seitz,
Allocations Committee liason to the

Board, had recommended that the V

Ten students living In these houses, 245 and'247 Lothrop, have been ordered to vacate the houses by January 1. ,
The University Health Center, Inc., plans to bulld a parking lot on the vacant lots atter tearing down the two houses. . \ . .

Brody was irate because the
University Health Center
tearing down the houses to build a
parking ‘lot and wondered why the
University could not‘ wait until this
spring ‘to vacate the houses.

“How much work can they do
here?“ Brody asked. They can’t

was '

money from the general fund be
used to alleviate -the debts.
At the start of Wednesday's

meeting, Seitz stated that alloca-

tions had uncovered $1,892 in funds
not used by the Young Socialist
Alliance and the Anti-lmperialist
Student Union. '

‘ Tlt is our right to take back money
from students who have not put on
programming they had scheduled, ’ ’
Seitz said. “We are recommending
that this money be used to pay off
our debts,”

The SGB accepted the new funds
into the general fund, then granted
WPGH its emergencyrequest.

yesterday evening to begin repairs.

those locations,” Couch said, “but
because of the defective equipment

we have only been reaching parts. ” - ~ 1‘
SGB presidentjosh Baylson said ; 
that funding would not begin until. _ = 

the station was granted "the
go-ahead from the housing ofﬁce._ ‘

“Before the station can get any; ._-,{ 
funds we. want to receive a -letter  ‘
from the housing ofﬁce stating that V,
it is’ feasible to set up the  ﬂfi

equipment,” Baylson said.

Couch agreed, saying, “Our next ; 
step will be to go to the proper’? 
housing authorities and get their  7
permission,” but he added, “Ithink. __ .,

that's just a formality.”

In other business, the board‘

_ passed a resolution requesting that-
the General Assembly reinstate the ’
Senatorial Scholarship program, to _
be associated in some way with the"
Pennsylvania Higher Education '

Assistance Agency.

The resolution calls for the 3 :3
scholarships to be awarded on the i

Smith explained it was necessary .

to raze the 7 -houses during the

‘winter to have the parking lots‘

ﬁnished by this spring.

“It takes three months‘ to
demolish the houses, prepare the
surfaces, andlay the blacktop,”
Smith explained. “We want ‘to

Anise explained. “France inter-
venes whenever they please, the
British also. These "military
interventions are not considered a
threat to Africa. Each country
intervenes -by invitation of the
state.” ,

“Western countries compete for
control of Africa...colonization is
theform of competitive imperialism
among European, monopoly of
European powers,” he added.

‘According to Anise’s article,

“For thelast 500 year, Africa has V '

economic and social ‘

been the target of the most

persistent forms of foreign inter-'

vention. .

“Since 1917, regimes outside the
Soviet Union have directly inter-
vened, not done communistically
or as unreasonably as Americans
are lead to believe,” he said.

The Soviet Union has donated
about $2 billion in aid, mostly to
Ethiopia, he article adds;

Anise concluded his discussion
by saying, “Whether or not military
intervention is desirable, _each
state must be decided on individual-
ly. There is a needto discriminate

“This decision ‘was probably
made before September, and ‘if it
was, we should have been told
about it during‘ the summer,”

1 Huffman said. 1

Smith said it was his fault that
the studentswere not‘ told until this
week that the houses were to be

‘ destroyed.

:‘It was my fault,” Smith said.

 _“I didn’t‘know the houses were
;. -empty this summer and didn't tell

the realtor the houses were going

A "to be demolished.'_ Mackey was

doing his job as he should have.
He was renting the houses.’

Louise Rogers, who rents 245

and 251 Lothrop and then sublets
them to students’, said it was
inexcuseable that the University
Health Center had failed to notify
their tenants‘ during ‘the summer.

“Why didn’t'they tell us about
this last summer? I put hundreds
of dollars into’ those houses to get
them ready for this fall,“ said
Rogers. “They could have told me
in June if this was in the University
Health Center's plans“

Rogers also said it was unfair for
the University Health Center to
raze these houses in January and
force the students‘ there to look for
housing ‘in the middle of the year
when few rentals are available.

"It won’t'kill them to scrap this
plan for three months. One student
in one of my houses is going to be
in school until the spring.- He i
going ‘to have his whole ﬁnal’ days‘
here loused up by this. There’s no
reason they can’t wait until April

 when places are available, ’ ’ Rogers
said.

Smith said the 65 parking places
that would replace the houses are
needed to help alleviate the critical
parking’ shortage for patients
coming ' to the hospitals in the
University Health Center complex.-

“Our” main concern is for the

patientswho come to the center for
appointments at 1 or 2 p.m. and
drive aimlessly looking ‘for parking
spaces,” Smith said. “They can’t
get parking, can’t see their doctor,
get discouraged and go home.”
Smith added that the students
have been offered other apart-
ments on Semple and Darragh
streets. Brody said he knew of the

offer of the Darragh Street house, -

but nothing about the Semple St.
offer. Rogers knew nothing "about
the offer of other places for the
students. , _

“The house on Darragh will be
next to the new parkinglot, and
-they can’t guarantee how long ‘the
house will be there,” said Brody.
We would be crazy to move there. ’ ’

The university and local hospitals
incorporated the University Health
Center, Inc. to coordinate efforts of
the medical school and Oakland
hospitals. The center plans to build
a health complex in the Darragh-
Lothrop area in the future but plans
are incomplete.

Mark Wilson anldll-ianklwright must vacate the house they now rent at 247 Lothrop by January.

 Demolishing
Houses Bungle
    Beyond Belief

T Louise Rogers summed up the problem we all face
in the wake" of the University Health Center’s move
to eject fourteen students from center-owned houses
on Lothrop Street. “I had no reason to believe they
were going to do something this miserable and this
mean,” ‘she commented. .

She was right. Deep down in our hearts, most of
us believed the University bureaucracy was more
competent and more humane than suddenly to
notify these students that they must abandon the
houses that many of them have just begun to rent this
fall. We thought it would have enough foresight to
plan its demolition schedule so it would not incon-
venience students in those houses.

We were wrong. . ‘ F

After this decision‘, we have to wonder what the
priorities of Pitt administrators are. On the one
hand, they sanctimoniously declare they want to

work with the community and curtail heir en-
croachment into the residential areas of Oakland,but
when it comes time for action the university health
center—a corperation headed by the vice-chancellor

I for health related professions and the dean of the
medical school—opts to destroy three residential ,
‘houses in exchange for 65 parking spaces.

Such a decision is ridiculous in light of the already
dangerous housing shortage thatexists in Oakland.

' The demand for apartments and rooms ‘in the area

always exceeds supply because of the thousands o__f
undergraduate and graduate students who annually
seek housing. - -
This situation is irritated by the ability of the '
University to house only 4000 undergraduates in
dormitories. The dilemna for graduate students such
as the dentistry students“ to be ejected K from the
Lothrop Street properties is even worse. They must
have the good luck to get one of the few open places
in Ruskin Hall or find some rental off-campus. . a
The health center does not plan to stop with these
three houses, however. Henry R. Smith, financial
officer for the health center, saidthe center plans to

.. tear down the rest of the houses it owns on Lothrop

and Darragh Strets. They plan to pave the vacant
lots and rent parking spaces to hospital patients and
others who visit the area.
complex is to be built in the Darragh-Lothrop area,
but plans‘ for that are still far from complete.

These plans seem to be a bureaucratic blunder
beyond our wildest dreams. When‘ the houses in the
Darragh-Lothrop area have finally fallen victim to

In the future, a health»

the wrecking ball -and the bulldozer, one of the last
areas where cheap housing exists near the center of
the campus will be gone forever. Someone seems to
have forgotten students have to live somewhere.
Already Pitt's enrollment has dropped, and this.
administration is seriously worried whether it can
stem this decline. Destroying valuable residential
property is. certainly not the way to encourage
student enrollment here: students need to be able to
find housing within walking distance of Pitt or they
will select another university where they can find a

nearby place to live. If the administration wants to -

attract students, it might show it has some concern
for its students. The easiest way to do that is to post-

pone or to cancel the plans ‘to raze the three Lothrop A

Street houses. Any action 1-es’s,than that cheats both
the students and-the University as a whole. '

Grosso Spices’Up Otherwise Boring Campaign

- By TOM KUKUCKA

iIt’s not right to praise a
convicted racketeer, so what can
you say about Anthony “Tony”
Grosso, who succeeded in instilling
some life, atleast for one week,
into the ho-hum gubernatorial race
that plagues Pennsylvania?

Grosso, rackets chief in Pitts- -

burgh since the late ‘40s, organized
his own Thornburgh for Governor‘
campaign, and the results were the
most amusingpart, since it was
discoveredthat Robert P. Casey,
high school teacher and recluse,

I had been elected Pete Flaherty’s

ru'nni'n'g’mate last May.

Grosso allegedly has solicited
money for Thornburgh independ-
ently through fund-‘raisers near his
Living Room restaurant- in Bethel

‘Park. He also allegedly commis-

sioned a plane ‘to carry a banner
over Three Rivers Stadium during a
Sept. 24 Steeler game stating,
“Mafia’,s Wango Capizzi hosts
Pete Fundraiser at VIP Club.”
Grosso’s antics raised the
following questions: Could Thorn-

burgh somehow be allied with a.
man he so desperately fought to
convict in the early 1970s? Grosso
was ﬁnally convicted in 1975, but
the sentence was reduced from 10

to ﬁve years, with prosescuter’

Thornburgh’s approval,“ making
Tony eligible for release after 28
months.
some of his people, have hired
Grosso to endorse .Thor/nburgh and
besmirch his- campaign?‘ The
answer to both questions is
probably “no,” and the real
answer could be that Grosso really

wants Thomburgh to fall on his .

political face, even though he
publicallyhas repeated that Flaher-
ty"‘cannot' win.” The amusing
aspect of the situation is that for
one week, one man ‘held two
candidates in his power.

The ‘campaign showed promise
last spring when mavericks Thorn-
burgh and Flaherty were nomin-
ated. It seemed that the race would
be somewhat interesting, with two
crime ﬁghters (Republican Thorn-
burgh as former deputy U.S.

Seminar Series for inviting the FBI

to the Pitt campus."
’ Five years. ago’ the Young’

Socialist Alliance and the -Socialist
Workers Party launched a major
civil liberties lawsuit against the

Although the case has
come to trial, the pretrial discovery
proceedings already have indicated
a mountain of FBI crimes.

The first big breakthrough in the

suit was the uncovering of the
FBI’s top-secret Cointelpro opera-
tion. Cointelpro is FBI lingo for its
illegal counter-intelligence pro-
gram against the YSA, SWP,

Director J. Edgar Hoover called

The law suit ofthe YSA and SWP
proves that the FBI exists not to

Lawrence Lee, Former Pitt Professor, H
Area Columnist, Dies of Stroke

Lawrence Lee, Pittsburgh Press
Sunday columnist and a former
English professor at Pitt, died
Wednesday in Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital. He had suffered a
stroke Monday morning.

Lee, 75, was a University of
Virginia graduate and had a
masters degree in literature from
Harvard- A‘ poet and short story
writer as well as a columnist, Lee
came to the University in 1949.
Pittsburgh became the setting for
many of his most successful works,
one of which, “The Cathedral,” is
inscribed on a wall in the Cathedral
of Learning’s Commons Room.

While at Pitt in 1962, Lee was
involved in an academic freedom
controversy that made him one of
the best-known instructors here.

Integrity,” Lee maintained that

cheating was widespread among

students and that the University
was not adequately dealing with
such problems as oversize classes
and poor teaching by graduate
assistants. Nine months later, a
special investigative committee
established Lee’s right to criticize
the University but concluded his
criticisms were essentially un-
founded.

Lee is survived by his wife, Grace
Kerr Lee; a daughter, Augusta Lee
Parrington; a brother, sister and
two grandsons. ’ -

Funeral arrangements were
made by H. Samson Inc., 537 North
Neville St., Oakland. Private
services are planned to be held at
Allegheny Cemetery, Lawrence-

There’s Dr. Bessner (Jack

Pantherettes Favored To Win Weekend Volleyball Toumey     .

By JEFFDUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

‘Pitt is the team to beat,this
weekend, when the Women’s
Volleyball Invitational gets under-

way at Trees/Hall. , ‘
The Pantherettes, defending
their unblemished record against 15

. other teams, will open against
Rutgers tonight at 6:30. Play will

Panthers

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The whole situation would make a A

terriﬁc avant-garde soap opera.
'Will Rick Trocano sustain the
passing touch he discovered in the
ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of the North
Carolina game? Will the Panthers
be able to eliminate the increasing
number of turnovers? Will the
football ﬁrst ﬁnd its way into the
hands of Gordon Jones and then
the

Boston College (0-3) and be part of.
the biggest upset in 1978?

For the answers to these and
other questions, tune’ in tomorrow
when the Panthers battle Boston

College in Chestnut Hill, Mass.

The story quickly could develop J

into a tragedy for the Eagles if they
come anywhere near their average
of seven fumbles a game. When
Boston College isn't fumbling the
ball,- it usually will be in the hands of
running back Anthony Brown, the
leading rusher with 126 yards.

Eagles head coach Ed Chlebek
probably will be without the
services of starting quarterback Jay
Palazola becauseof a badly bruised
shoulder‘. Palazola, officially listed
as questionable for tomorrow’s
game, would i be. replaced by-
freshman Dennis Scala.

Even though assistant head coach

Jimmy Johnson ‘has voiced some _

concern over the defense’s ability to
respond to Pitt turnovers, the
offensive unit will be the key to the
game. 7 A

T rocano proved he has the
capabilitylto move the team via the
pass; what the passing game needs
now is consistency. .

“Rick is a young quarterback,”
said Gordon J ones: “He’s had a‘ lot
of pressure, and I admire him for
withstanding it and coming through
whenewe needed it.”

continue until tomorrow’s finals at
6:30 p.-m. _ '7

Among the» teams competing
will be Temple, Maryland and
Georgetown, placing second, third

and fourth, respectively, behind the ‘

Pantherettes at the Temple Invita-
tional last week.

Head coach Mike Hebert sees
Rutgers, and Temple as the

Pantherettes’ two biggest challen-
gers for the title.

“They’re both very tough teams‘
with a lot of strong, young players, ”
Hebert said.

Pitt’s strength lies in its potent
offense, “one of the most powerful
in- the East,” Hebert said.

“I feel we have the best

sette“r-—the quarterback of the
team—around, in Maria Perez,”
he added.

However, Hebert believes im-
ment could be made in the
Pantherette’s “inconsistent”. de-
fense.

The Pantherettes will enter the

1 tournament without the services of

junior co-captain Cindy Chambers.

She injured her ankle at Temple and ‘
will be in a cast until at least”

Monday. In addition, Paula Olsen;

still is experiencing pain from .3‘: ‘ '

possible stomach muscle’ tear.
“Volleyball is an exciting specta-'

tor sport—this is not the beach‘

game," Hebert said. “This is at

great opportunity for Pitt‘ students"

to see volleyball at its best.”

To continue to “come through,”
Trocano must again locate his

from forcing the ball into, the double ,

“North Carolina covered me

Steeler,QB Choice Doesn’t Concern

By The Associated Press

Atlanta Falcon coach Leeman
‘Bennett says it doesn't matter
whether the Pittsburgh Steelers use-
Terry Bradshaw or Mike Kruczek as
quarterback against his team.’

~, ‘ ‘I don’t think Pittsburgh changes

that much regardless of who is at
quarterback,” Bennett said as the
Falcons prepared _ ., for ' Sunday's

National Football League game with "

the Steelers.

“We weren't able to stop either
one before.”

But Bradshaw,\ injured last
Sunday as the Steelers defeated the
New York J ets_ 28-17, is expected to
start even though he has been
listed as probable during practice.

“I ﬁgure he’ll play,” said

"VKruczek. “He’s come back from

injuries like this. He plays with a lot
of pain and is used to it.”
Bradshaw‘ went down squirming
with twominutes left to play after
Jet linebacker Mike Henn_igan dove
at his right kneeto make a tackle.

The 30-year-old Bradshaw has a

lot of stamina. That often means —

that the 25-year-old Kruczek, a
backup, does a lot’ of waiting
between regulation performances.
‘ ‘I keep teasing him and saying to
him, ‘How long can you last?’ ’’A

Kruczek said, smiling. “He tells me
he’ll play ﬁve or six more years, end
Itell him he can’t last that long. Or
I’ll tell him he can‘t make it next
year. ’
‘‘I.think it keeps him going.”
Bradshaw didn’t play against

Doug Alston.
The Eagles only have allowed 140

yards through the air this season,
but that could . be because

I opponents have been able to run the

ball up and ’_down.the ﬁeld. Boston
College has allowed 758 yards on
the ground. .

run and a triple - and two runs

Dodgers beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 4-0 and took a 2-0 lead in
the best-of-ﬁve National League
Championship Series,‘

While Lopes keyed the offense,
Dodgers lefthander Tommy John
limited the Phillies to four hits,
striking out four and walking ‘two.

Only four balls were hit overthe»-

heads of the inﬁelders as the
33-year-old John’s' sinkerball kept

.the Phillies hammering into‘ the
ground. _ A ,
The series now moves to Los
Angeles for as many as needed of
three scheduled weekend games.
In the ﬁrst two games, Lopes - the
32-year-old second baseman --has
six hits in nineat-bats, ﬁve RBI,
two homers, a double and triple.
The Phillies headed-for the West
Coast needing ‘a three-game sweep
to become the ﬁrst team in the
10-year history of the playoffs to
come back from an 0-2 deﬁcit. In
the last three years, the. Phillies

Pitt offensive lineman Mark May
says he has _played relatively well

’' _.: ..».this‘ season.‘ Offensive line coach

Don Boyce doesn’t agree.

_. ._ “The way he practices and the I
 way. he_ plays are two different

things,” said Boyce, who believes

 the 6-foot-6, 262-pound sophomore
' has the potential to be the best
”tackl,e.in the nation. “He hasn’t

been very consistent.”
‘ According to Boyce, May's scores

-I A have been poor on the weekly scales

Pitt uses to assess its offensive
linemen.

“We expect each of our linemen
to grade out to 80 percent,” said

‘Boyce, explaining the players are

assessed on both their overall

« performance and technique. “Mark

isn’t anywhere near that ﬁgure. In

‘fact,-- none of our starters are,

although Matt Carroll, who’s done a

Vﬁne job for us, is approaching it.”

his own potential, May doesn’t

agree with Boyce, who in the past-
’ - has demoted May to second team for

not playing up to his capabilities..

“I know coaches do a lot of
different things to try to motivate
the players,” May said. “They
think they’re helping the players.
Well, I'm the type who has to be left
alone. I'm very self-motivated.

“Only the player knows whether"
he's playing up _to his capabilities, ”
May added. “I’m ’ not really
satisﬁed with the way I've played
this season. There are some things I
have to improve, including my base
(straight-ahead) blocking.

‘ ‘I think I can play a lot better, but
I’m playing my best and practicing
hard, and that’s all that really
counts,” May said. “Improvement
will come with time.

May's approach to football often is
misconstrued as indifference.

‘ ‘I’ m not the leader type who goes
out and constantly claps his hands
and jumps - up and down,” he

Pitt rebounded with a 7-2 win
over Slippery Rock Wednesday. «

“We didn’t find Syracuse to be
very sportmanlike,” said Pitt
assistant coach Irma Pytka. ‘ ‘It was
a hectic night between their

questioning of spectators.’ ’

The Pitt soccer team, led by Criag
Connolly’s hat trick, overpowered
Gannon College, 9-0, to even its
record at 3-3.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis believed
Gannon played similar to last
season when the Panther won, 7-1.

“Gannon was shy a couple of
men, but they basically were the
same team we defeated last
season,”. said Bemis.. “I think
we’ve started putting everything
together: we used tactics against

Gannon we should have been using >

all season.

“These are the kind of games we
must win convincingly, ’ ’ said
Bemis. “It should give us a boost for
Buckne1l.’’ ,

Scoring began with a Nigh-

had several more scoring opportuni-

the opposing fullback and scored
unassisted from 20 yards out.

The Nigh brothers combined
again when Louis passed to Karl for
the Panthers’ third score. Two
minutes later, Mark Nigh once
again registered another assist by
passing to sophomore wing Barry
Stein who scored Pitt's fourth goal.

The Panthers continued their
attack, as Louis Nigh notched his
fourth assist of the night when he
took a direct kick and chopped the
ball over the defense. Sophomore
midﬁelder Johnny O’Hara ran to
the ball and rocketed a volley shot
pass the keeper. The Panthers led,
5-0. '

Jerry Buirge then showed some
ﬁne individual effort when he deked
two defenders and passed ball to

Marty Moyer, who scored his first
goal of the season.

Moyer then became the assist
man when he and senior striker
Craig Connolly combined for two of
Connolly’s three goals.

Connolly, who was the Panthers’
high scorer last year with 13 goals,
was pleased with the team's
performance.

“The team looked good,” he
said. “The offense worked the ball
well, and the defense" was strong
in recording its third shutout of the
season.” ,

Panther goalie John Bonnessi got
his first shutout of the season in his
second start of the year. Although ‘
Bonnessi only was tested twice, he
made a spectacular save with 30
seconds left in the game to secure
the whitewash.
