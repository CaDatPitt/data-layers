gree, that of Doctor of Laws, in 1919'?
at Marquette University, and it is

.wo_rthy of note, that within a quar- - l
ter century no” dentist in America A

had been honored by this degree;
Dean Friesell has served as presi-
dent ot _the- Pennsylvania State
Dental Society, the National Associa-
tion of Dental Faculties and the
American Institute of Dental Teach-
ers, and was-,last year elected unan-
imously as g’  sident of the Nation-
al Dental>Association, which includes
nearly 30,000 members. He has long
been a member of "the National As-
sociation of Dental Examiners, and
has had the most prominent part in
the classiﬁcation of the country’s
dental schools. During the war he
was dental examiner of this district
of all applicants for commission in
the Dental Reserve Corps, and served
on several committees of the 
cll of National Defense. ; —
Entering‘ the dental faculty of the
University in 1903 as instructor in
Histology, -he”1vas made Dean and

Professor of O-per:l.tive Dentistry as

year later and has held those posi-
tions for sixteen years. How well
he has ﬁlled them is attested by the
remarkable growth of the school, its
progress to the very forefront of
American dental colleges, its high

standing throughout the country and

the wondefful personal popularity
which ‘ the dean has enjoyed with

successive generations of dental s1u- A

dents in his profession in the dis-
trict and country. ’

Dr. Frlesell is one of the most.

versatile of men. He somehow ﬁnds
time _in the, midst of his unusual

achievements to take an interest in 
many things outside his work and ‘

to have a mighty good time of it.
He was once a famocs athlete,.cap-V
tamed the P. A. C. track team, and

was for some years considered the"
greatest all around athlete in West»

ern Pennsylvania. He was for some
ticine a member of the University’s
Athletic Committee. As" a...young:
man he won national distinction by
winning the Tournveran. champion-
ship, piling up a wonderful list of
yictories. ‘ g b
Dr._ F-rlesell was married in 1898
to Miss Esther J. Hutchinson, and
the first of their three ‘children, Dor-
othy Ma'rion+Frle~sell, has a Pitt rec-
ord of her own. Charles Edmund

esday afternoon -the Pitt
-=P,a.nther.s opened their «baseball season
7‘ at home with Juniata College as their
fguests of honor, It was a grand feast,
that Pitt gobbled up the food and

served the ‘vis‘itoiris.-only with a 12-1
pdefealt. The game was late in start-
”ing‘ and considerable time was wasted

juring -the embroglio by dribbling be-

‘tween the umpires and the players.

 Ike Bloom, the Pitt spit-ball artist,
“was in rare. form, and until the
:.,.seventh inninghe did not allow a
‘single bingle. iHe eased up a. bit
f towards the- last and allowed four hits.
‘two of which were~ann-exedby Juni-
,fata’s’ coach and captain, Flory, who
» also did their basket-stopping. Bloom
established a1record,at,_,the ba.t. He
‘received ‘ﬁve bases on balls in as many
 at the plate and he purloined a
Teach as well. He ‘made three of the
Blue and Go1d’s tallies. He pitched a
,,-very clever. game, fanning ‘ﬁve of the.
opposing batters, and he did not issue
.,a‘ walk in the entire game. ,
 _, Pitt managed to . diagnose Gal-
~braith’s twirls early in the fray.’ Jones

/Ybraith was wild and ineffective, and
-was repaced ‘by Horton at the end of
'-the third. Horton, who came in from

allowing six -bases on balls, was re-
lieved by Snyder. _ '

“The batting of Ryman and Captain

made to taste the dirt that a Panther
man slammed one out and was soon

Smith, the Grove City twirler,
pitched good ball, but his curves were
diagnosed towards the end’ of the
game, and there was nothing on God's
green" earth to stop the sudden spurt
of the Pittites. In the seventh and
eighth innings the Panthers had» a
regular merry-go-round, and tied the
score at 7 to 7. Coach Harley's men
had been talked to and pepper was
injected, the gamewas to ‘be won. The
last of the ninth and the score was
still 7-7, up comes Brady and with a
clean homer ends the fracas and, con-
sequlently, placed the ball on ice.
Brady was, by far, the feature of the
game. His" ﬁelding, with the exception
of a sour error, was of National League
caliber. His hitting was superb. He
got four hits, a single, a double, a
triple and a. homer and the sﬁred 2 of

This Week

The track team won a. rather un-
expected and exceedingly pleasing vic-
tory over Lafayette last Saturday at
Easton.’ The score, 58-54, indicates»
how close the meet really ‘was. only
the ﬁrst two places counted. 5 for
first and I3 forescond. ' It would only
have taken a second place for Lafay-
ette, instead of Pitt, to have changed
the whole complexion of the meet and
given the __victory to the Eastonians.
Thus every, Pitt man who got either
a ﬁrst or alsecond can share in the
credit for the victory: ' ’ r j
It one,man more than another de-
serves the credit, that man is Chapel.

ﬁlled Curry’s*shoes in the high jump
to a nicety and brought home the
bacon in that event. Shea had; two
ﬁrsts in the. 220 and 440. Capt. Red
'Wiegel won the two-mile and finished
second to Crawford in the half. Ralph
Klingensmith. was second in the two-
mile and Jim Bovard ran a. 4:37 mile,
ﬁnishing runner-up A to -"Crawford.
Brickley scored well in the hurdles,
winning the low and ﬁnishing second
in the high. Harry Martin was dis-
qualiﬁed in the low hurdles for knock-
ing over three. Martin also got a sec-
ond in the broad-jump. —

It was in the weight events that
Pitt scored heavily. Tom Thornton
won the shot, Jimmy McIntyre the
hammer and Harvey ‘Harman the dis-
cus.‘ In ‘addition, Thornton got sec-
ond in the hammer. In a way Harvey
Harman is the ‘hero of the meet. The
discus was the last event and’ Lama}?-
ette needed a first to tie, or a ﬁ1‘S'l’. and
second to -win. ‘They had two good
men in’ the_*disous, but Harvey came
through with the winning heave, and
the meet was Pitt's. A v
As for third places, Pitt had seven

used, the Panthers would still have
won. ‘ _,_lS'evera1 Pitt men who did not

Capers had a. third in both the shot
and broad-jump. For a while it look-
ed as though _he had a. seoondain the
broad, but Marrtin"s last jump nosed

ed right on the heels of Morgan, their
star quarter-‘niiler. Lafayette had two
good sprinters, but Peters was right

VARSITY TENNIS TEAM EASILY,

The varsity, tennis team had little
trouble taking every set trom the
Thiel College racqueters in the ﬂrst
encounter of the -season, and -the
Greenville boys went home nursing a
sore'defeat.. ‘ .

The -team journeyed to Grove City
on Saturday to meet the court artists
‘of that institution, but upon arriving
there they learned that Grove City had
neither 9. team» nor a place to play,
so the boys returned to Pittsburgh
without even showing theinj wares.
’,.There are three meets on for the
present . week———Geneva, West Virginia
and Washington & Jefierson are met
in order. .It is expected that the Pan-
ther courtnien will ‘be called upon to
show all the tricks they ahave, in order
to come out ahead in all three of
these matches. It is hoped that the
boys can reach their stride before the

season.
Merritt, one of the best -tennis play-
ers in school, and -who played on the
team last year, has been unable to get
' out thus; far this season, but it is
shape soon, so that he may be ready
for dutywhen the time comes for the
team to extend themselves to win the
games before them. A

Chapel's high jumping won the meet
at Lafayette.

Capers is broad-jumping two tee
farther thanhe did when he first came
out, two weeks ago. What will he be
doing two weeksfrom now?

Capers is proving himself a. good,
all-around man. He is a good man in
the sprints. He can broad-j-ump and
high-jump. In addition, he puts the
shot 37 feet and can throw the discus.
