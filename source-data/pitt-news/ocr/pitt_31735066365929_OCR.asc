Without elections

Inn.. March 21, 1912

MDC ofﬁcers okayed

by CHUCK s'rEEi?E'it
The uncertainties surrounding

the Men’s Dorm Council elections.

were cleared up Friday when it
was decided to allow three uncon-
tested candidates to assume.of-
fice without an election. °

Only three people.( Scott Spada-
fore, president; Reid Morgan,
treasurer; and David Tolner, sec-
retary) petitioned for the offices,
and it was unknown whether the
candidates could assume. office
withoutcompetition.

Then the eligibility of Scott
Spadafore came into question.
Spadafore was the only candidate
for president, but his name was
not on the main Housing Office
roster and it was unknown wheth-
er he lived in the dorms.

Spadafore was not a dorm resi-
dent during the Fall term, so his
name did not appear on the Hous-
ing roster. But since he lived in
the Towers last year,his eligiblity
was‘ upheld. Joanne Woodson, As-
sistant Housing Director, decided
that although only three candi-
dates filed their petitions correct-
ly and were therefore eligible,
there was no reason to keep them
from taking office, whether they
ran unop/posed or not. A

The new officers were inform-
ed that Ken Krenicky, present
MDC president, would officially
notify them of their election by
mail.

Noting that the" Szabo Food Co.

contracts ’will be up for negotia- A

tions this summer, Spadafore
predicts that Szabo Food Co. will
be retained.

SPADAFORE
Named MDC President

_As to the spectulation that the
dorm room drawings will be re-
held, Spadafore said, “The room
drawings will not be reheld. Next
year's room assignmentsghave al-
ready started to be processed.
The situation can not be revers-
ed.”

Spadafore hopes to keep the
present security setup, unless un-
fortunate incidents arise, war-
ranting a return to the tighter se-
curity system used last year.

Spadafore decided that MDC
meetings would be held in’ the
same fashion as under Ken Kren-
icky, “Meetings of MDC will be

Stereotype corrected

held only when there is relevant
business to transact, because I
feel that the Senators'will lose in-
terest if they have. to go to useless
meetings,” he explained.

The new treasurer. Reid Mor-
gan, hopes to secur.e .adequate
funds from the Allocations Com-
mittee to remodel parts of the
dorms and supply entertainment
to dorm students. Morgan and
other officers want MDC parties
in the cafeteria and more Friday
and Saturday dances in the Tow-

ers Lobby. They hope to turn the

23rd floor of Tower B into a game-
room. There is presently a game-
room in the basement of the Tow-
ers,but it is cold in the winter and
hot in the summer--and water
flows into it from the cafeteria.

Morgan is optimistic about the
future of his administration,but
feels that whateverhe; attempts
to do will depend heavily upon stu-
dent cooperation and support. For
instance, if the 23rd floor is turn-
ed into a gameroom it will be up
to the students to make sure that
it is not destroyed, Morgan said.

Morgan added, “I really think
its’a matter of initiative._We.re'al-
ly don’t know what we can accom-
plish until we try.”

Dave Tolner, secretary--elect,
is still not sure how he views the
purpose of MDC. He feels that
the major problem faced by MDC
is the budget, which is overdue.
“We have to get it completed
and submitted to the Allocations
Committee as soon as possible,”
he said.

The new officers will be install-
ed on April 4.

At Trustees meeting

Shapp endorses PIRG

by GLENDA MINSHULL
News Editor

PIRG received endorsement from the Shapp administration via

1 the Attorney General at a Friday meeting of the Student Affairs Com-

mittee of the Board of Trustees.

Judge Ruggero Aldis ert, chairman of the committee, moderated the
discussion,which included input from PIRG, Student Government, fac-

ulty, administration, graduate and undergraduate students, state offi-

cials, and committee members.

Attorney J. Shane Crvamer distributed a 17 page report from the I

Pennsylvania Department of Justice, which concluded that “the Uni-
versity has the authority to enter into a contract with PIRG and its tax

exempt status will not be affected by any such contractj’. eliminating’

the two major objections to the proposal.

The piupused contracts legality is contingent upon system of non- A

mandatory fee collection and an annual budget review, both included
in the PIRG proposal.

The report alsorefutes the possibility of Pitt losing its tax exempt
status because ofits association with PIRG. Although PIRG’s activities
“may involve lobbying for passage or defeat of legislation,’-’ according
to the Internal Revenue Service code, neither the University nor PIRG
will be taxable under “a provision which provides recognition to ‘so-
cial welfare’-type organizations which may have legislative objectives
but which do not engage in partisan political efforts.”

During a discussion on the fee collection, Vice Chancellor of Oper-'

ations Joseph Dutton suggested a separate envelope for. the PIRG fee
be included with the academic invoice. He rejected a line billing of
PIRG on the academic invoices, because “it gives the illusion that the
Univ'éi"sity requires this payment?‘

Student Government officials, representing undergraduates, re-

jected a $2 fee hike in the student activities fee to cover PIRG costs, '

since PIRG would encompass a much wider scope of’ the University
community, including graduatesand faculty members. '

Judge Aldisert, after reviewing the discussion, will report on the ’

PIRG proposal to the Board of Trustees at their April 7 meeting.

Merger enacted for

dorm judicial board 

by ROB OBENREDER

Procedures are underway to
combine the Men’s and Women’s
Residence Hall Judical Boards
into a single body, the Coed Resi-
dence Hall Judicial Board.

Members of both boards hope-

to provide a more egalitarian ap-
proach to cases presented‘ Coed

housing and more liberal dorm

, Indian culture spotlighted

by LINDA SAVAGE

The Indian festival sponsored
by the Special Programs Office
was devoted to reminisces about
the dying Indian culture.

Nazir Sunderji, cq-chairman of
the affair, introduced the session,
“Many wrongs have been done to
the American Indian and everyone

’ knows it.” Much of the program

was devoted to discussing the

wrongs doneto the Indians and the
image the Indian has been given
in today's American society.

Nazir said that the image of a
war-hopping, burning the trail.
scalping Indian still exists, even
after all this time.

George Heron, a Seneca Indian,
told of the history of the Seneca
nation and how he is part of this
nation today. Six generations ago

 

one of his ancestors, Peter Kraus,
a white child, was captured by the
Seneca Indians and kept until he

was 18. At 18 he was given the op-

tion of returning to the whites but
he preferred to remain and raise
a family with the Seneca nation.

Today, said Heron, the Seneca

people are 4,600 strong. The Sene— _

ca nation lives on tw_o reserva-

tions; two other Seneca "reser-

vations” have no‘ inhabitants._,ac-
cording to Heron.

Heron said, “The Indians have
resisted the assimilation with
whites so far.” However, he add-
ed, “We are strongly influenced
by white people.” ‘

Today many of the Indians have

left the reservation to work on ,

construction jobs, railroads,’ and
in factories. This may be due to
the poor quality of education on
the reservation, said Heron.

Despite the poor educational fa-
cilities on the reservation, Heron
commented that two young men
from the reservation have gone to
West Point and one has been ac-
cepted at Annapolis.

Elizabeth Clifford, from the
Rosebud Reservation in South
Dakota, explained thatlthe main
problem the Indian faces today is

it .7-‘getting a job. «Because they can-
_ not get jobs, their living condi-

tions suffer, and they cannot prop-

perly raisetheir families. I 

‘\

She believes that the young peo-
ple need to get an education so
they can get better jobs,and added »
thatall seven of her children are
educated?’

 Silver showing lacks A    

 imaginative inspiration

by DEAN SIEGAL .

A collage entitled Trees. opens
the exhibit of prints and paintings
by Doni Silver, now on display
through April 8 at the Lutheran
University Center. This composi-
tion opens her small show«of 15
works sensationally, and one ex-

pects the rest of her exhibit to V-

contain other, equally fine works.

Disappointment rather than sat-
isfaction was the end result of this

show, however. Of the other 14-
works, only one deservees men--t

tion. An artist’s proof, which she
calls Small Audience, is indeed a
fine work of art. There is some-
thing about it that is very differ-
ent from the other works. Here,
purple and black are employed in

‘ya a most skillful and effectiveway.

I‘

.x

The mood and composition of the
work are well portrayed though
the contrasting expressiveness of
these two colors. - '

Silver’s creative media include
ink, acrylic, air brush, and litho-

graphy. Other works of this col- A

lection appear to be semi-abstract
in form withan attempt at objec-
tivity. Very little color is employ-
ed, thus giving somewhat of a dull

appearance to the exhibit as a
whole. Where color is used, how-
ever, it is used skillfully, as the
use of purple in Small Audience.

The artist’s talent for drawing
is doubtful. and the human figure
is represented several times
through various abstract and
semi-objective media. Even so,
the artist obviously does not total-
ly lack talent;for two works in her
exhibition partially portray some
semblance of talent. Best of all,
the prices for her work seem to
be quite reasonable.

This 25-year-old'Studio Arts ma-

jor could have put together
a much better show hadher eye
taken into consideration the lack
of color and imagination which is
so inherent in her work. A

ilyreverses pot decision

by STEVE LUBETSKY

;. - ilMichigan recently became the first state in the nation to, at
. least temporarily, legalize marijuana, when the State Supreme

Court overturned the conviction of John Sinclair, sentenced in 1969

3 -. c for holding two joints.

The Court also declared’ the present marijuana law unconstitu-

/tional, so possession is legal until a new law making possession of
:~ marijuana a misdemeanor goes into effect‘April 1.

Judging from recent events, the ruling could wellnbe a prece-

 , dent for the future of the weed. For just last week_ the National Com-

 ,mission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse recommended the abolition
; of federal and state restrictions against personal possession and

 ~ ‘private use of marijuana.

. The Commission justified its report on grounds that marijuana
. usage involves only “minimal risk to the public health” and also
because of its sociological implications. Panel members agreed that

marijuana has become “a symbol of the generation gap” and an

 outlet for protest among young people againstestablishment values.

72 -“For this group we must de-glorify, de-mythologize, and de-
)5; —- emphasize the use of marijuana and other drugs,” they affirmed.

 The Commission suggested removal of penalties for personal
possession and use while retaining prohibitions on production, distri-

bution, and public use.

Critics of the Commission’s findings argue that legislation
would be nothing more than sanctioning law-breaking. This view
was reflected by Dr. Charles Winek, chief toxicologist for the
coroner’s office, who pointed out that home users of «marijuana may
 still be subject to arrest for receipt from illegitimate _sources.
‘ , This, he maintained, would create additional problems in enforce-

m_.e_ni.

 Joseph Buckley, head of the pharmacology department at
 I Pitt, remarked that there is "no evidence whatever of ill effects

thus far collected “is on acute use."

the Commission would recommend legalization of pot, his adminis-.

'ume' drowns out the

Dough needs kneading

B/read album toasted

by JOHN DOWNING

Out of the oven, comes a
fresh new loaf of Bread. Dave
Gates is’ the baker and "Mother
Freedom” is the first slice.
But it’s far from characteristic

-of Bread. Somehow this young

group seems unsuited for a poor
imitation of coarse rock. Vol-
shallow
lyrics that run: “Freedom:-keep

. walkin’ /Keep on your toes and

don’t stop talkin' ‘bout / Freedom-
get goin’ /Lots to be _learned and
lots to be knowin’ ‘bout /People
—gotta reach 'em.“ Maybe its
better that way.

"Baby I‘m - A Want You"
comes along just in time with
Bread back in their best groove.
It’s reminiscent of "I Wanna
Make It With You" and "If."
two genuine classics. Featuring
the haunting rhythm guitar of
Jimmy Griffin, and the sweet.
high, voice of Dave Gates, it‘s
a simple, mellow tune offered
up in praise of a woman. Un-
complicated orchestration helps
round this tune into a polish-

GATES: “High, sweet voice”

you." makes one think of the
loss of some lover to another.
after years of sweet harmony.

Fine acoustical guitar work
by Griffin and the sweet. high
voice of Gates again, sells this
love ballad letigimately. Settling
back for more might be un-
wise, though, in view of the
shock that soon follows.

and it’s ironic that they've spent
time on a cut that could only
be considered a half-hearted
attempt at imitation.

Likewise the album alter-
nates. cut by cut. between
these dishonest spurts of medio-
Crity and genuine, polished
works of art like "Diary." "Dream
Lady." "Games of Magic.“ and
"Just Like Yesterday.” all on the
second side. "Dream Lady" is
an airy tune. lyrically devoted
to the praises of a lady, a
theme consistent with most of
the album. It continues in "Games
of Magic." succeeding on the
merit of its deep reflective
thoughts and Larry Knechtel‘s
first ratetdemonstration on the
organ. “Just Like Yesterday,"
written and sung by Jimmy Grif-
fin, would have been a nice way
to end everything, .

Instead, Gates got too clever
with "This Isn't What the Gov-
ernment," and “I Don't Love
You," the last two cuts. The
first is a country and western
jam, with an ingenious mani-

ed song.

The same holds for a peaceful
melody titled "Everything I '
Own," probably one of the four
best tunes Bread has‘ ever
handled. "You sheltered me from
harm /Kept me/warm . . . kept
me warm /You gave my life to
me /Set me free . . . set me free
The finest years I ever knew /
Were all the years I had with

through:

"Down On My Knees,"
minds one of
"Grass Roots might have done
four years ago. An anachronism
to say the least, it drones on
"I told you before—-
don‘t you hear what I say /I,
won‘t take it no more——no more
makiri, me stay /Down on my

Liberationist lawyer Reeves goes

beyond usual female stereotype

by DIANE HOLLINGSWORTH

Nancy Reeves, Los Angeles lawyer and author
of Womankind: Beyond the Stereotypes, is just
that: a woman beyond“ the stereotypes. The lec-
ture, which turned out to be an informal chat in-
volving about ten people, was_ more a discussion
of history, sociology, and ways of getting_at the
truth than a manifesto for liberation.

Reeves, a quiet, grey-haired lady. discussed
her studies of women across three continents
in a reflective voice. occasionally stopping to
ask listeners, "What do you think?" or “How does

that sound to you?” Her calm intellectualism lent’

an air of sanity to what is normally an explosive
and emotional topic.

Although a lawyer. Reeves, or Nancy, as every-
one there called her. has spent much time travel-

ling; she visited Cuba. for instance, in the first

years after‘ Castro came into -power. She was
impressed by the efforts made to raise the standard
of living, and the part women played in the be-
ginning. She has also visited Poland and the
U.S.S.R., where she found women still burdened
with “a dual role: when a ‘woman doctor‘in Rus-
sia comes home after a hard day, she still has to
clean the house, do the laundry, and cook dinner,"
according to Reeves. ' ’

_ Nancy's ‘approach to the problem of women’s
rights is historical; the question she poses is:

. it always this way, she noted.
studies indicate that in ancient Egypt there were I

“why are women outsiders in society?" She finds
the origin of this idea, oddly enough, in the In-
dustrial Revolution. “Before that,” she stated,“the
family was a unit; when labor became a commod-
ity, the family split up, and woman became the
marginal labor force.” I

The biological explanation——that \woman’s
place in society is determined by her sexual func-
tion—- does not wholly satisfy Reeves. Nor was
Anthropological

women of property and some holding high posi-
tions in society, she said.

The fact that-women lack power in 'today’s
society is due, she says, to the supremacy of
economic considerations over others, such as re-
ligious or family ties. "In our society, the cash tie
is more significant,” Reeves stated.

She discussed other topics, too, such as debating:

. “Never argue on their ground. Shift to your own.”

Or sociology: “At first I thought,‘it’s not real in-
formation, it’s just semantic contriving.’ Now I
realize it is a method of thought.”

"I'm just suggesting you think and be skepti-
cal." she insisted. And that is her idea for the fu-
tures a realistic approach to life as it is. The wo-.
men s movement will have to relate to reality; in
short. get away from the stereotypes. she concluded.

-Senator reviews black quest for freedom

"The black rallying cry of the
1970’s will be “Black people
can’t be planned for they must
be planned with," said Senator
in a speech
Friday.

The state senator from Geor-
gia described the change that

 has taken place in the South

in; the last decade. “It’s a reali-
zation on the part of black peo-
ple that things just ain’t gonna
be like they used to be,“ he
said. - '

 The change started in 1960
in North Carolina as» a tremen-
dous student movement, John-

__,  son said. The white reaction was
 y‘i_“th1$ thing ;isn’t going to, last

  

long. It’s just a fad,” he added.

“As we moved throughout the
Southland it emanated from the
bottom up. From the man on the
street it moved up to the col-
lege professor." Johnson. said.
White people were humored by
the smile. on a black man‘s face
and the occasional scratching of
his head, Johnson said, but ex-
plained it as “a method of sur-
vival and a thirst for freedom. T’

. Johnson recalled a mother’s
comments as she bailed out her
17-year-old son after a civil
rights demonstration: “These
young folks just ain’t gonna take
what we took,f_’ she told the
judge. He also quoted a teen-

.‘ \l ’‘

there's a lot of good enjoyable .

aged girl's definition of free-
dom: “It’s the right to do what
everyone else is doing.”

Throughout his political car-
eer. Johnson said he has been
close to the people, and advised
any politician to act the same
way. "I‘ve built my political
life on that philosophy." he
said.

Johnson first ran for the state
legislature in 1962. "None of us
were supposed to run at the
time,“ he said. His rich Repub-
lica‘n opponent rented a plane
with a streamer as part of his
advertising campaign. Johnson
was asked what he thought about

‘it. "He’s up there above the

’ population is

people. and I’m down here with
the People." was his reply.

_ Johnson was recently involved
In fi_ legislative battle over the
political future of Atlanta, whose

half black and
half white.

"There is a growing fear that
Atlanta will become too influ-
ential: Whites want to bring
about consolidation and annexa-
tion to Fulton County. The
‘Annex Atlanta" bills will dil-
ate black voting strength." John-
son said. The 55,000 additional

white votes would" “tip the
scales against us." he added,
Johnson managed to "out-

‘ maneuver“ the majority of white

legislators and had a version of
the bill passed that was in favor
of the black community. He said
he was unexpectedly helpedtin
his struggle by Lieutenant Gov-
ernor Lester Maddox.

“When it comes to black peo-
ple, he (Maddox) has a blind
spot,” Johnson said. “He doesn’t
follow any pattern, politically.

The man is so irrational, he I

can’t be predicted,

Johnson said. "We've made

Nihilistic ‘Orange’ erotic odure

by STEVE zvcn

Did you enjoy the glorious gore
and frenzied hysteria of Ken
Russell in The Devils? 'Do
scenes of rape, senseless vio-
lence.and even more senseless
dialogue turn you on?

Fear not, for now you can safe-
ly revel in all that retch. con-
tent in the knowledge, that it‘s
“cinematic art" (whatever that
means anymore) as Stanley Kub-
rick once again truckles to all
your nihilistic fantasies in his
grotesque and grandiose porno-

violent sex comedy'—A Clock-

work Orange.

Supposedly based on Anthony
Burgess’ brilliant 1962 parable
about life and the meaning of
freedom in a totalitarian society.
Kubrick’s farrago is an excellent
example of how one can faith-
fully adapt a film's story line,
but betray its meaning.

The hero and narrator of
Orange is Alex, (portrayed per-

.fectly in the film by Malcolm

Mc Dowell) a sardonic young
sadist who robs, rapes and kills
for personal gratification. We are

’proves

somewhat distanced. however.
from enjoying what Alex engages
in (much as we would like to) by
a brilliant device—an artificial lan-
guage. Burgess employs this con-
trived jargon to assimilate. yet

simultaneously distance us from ,

his protagonist. One gets the feel-
ing while reading Burgess that
though the author is asking us to
sympathize with his main char-
acter, he never condones or ap-
the actions of Alex.

Here is the crucial difference
between the book and the film.
Kubrick not only forces our sym-
pathy for his hero (through his
-marvelous ca-merawork and re-
duction of all other characters
to caricatures), but also condes-
cends to condone. all the
irrational behavior, ‘including
rape and murder, on the popular

premise ‘that since, society is.

evil, the individual can do any-
thing he pleases.

Ten years ago this would have
been a daring stand. to take. To-
day, in light of the popularity
accorded such "charming” peo-
ple as Charles Manson and Lt.

Brundo’s ‘Godfather’
captures novel's thrills

by GERALD VELMER

The long-awaited film ver-
sion of the best seller The God-
father opened last week at the
Warner Theater. Director Fran-
cis Ford Coppola has captured
all the "suspense and thrills
inherent in Mario Puzo’s novel.
This current release will cer-

tainly prove to be a box office

success.

I The plot centers around a Ma-‘I

fiayfamily between the late 40’s
and early 50’s. During this time
Don Vito Corleone (Marlon
Brando) is in his later years, and
his youngest son, Michael (Al
Pacino) succeeds as head of the
family.

This personal drama portray-
ed against a background of vio-
lence, bloodshed, and gang wars,
runs a total of three hours, and
keeps the. audience 1 spellbound

1 throughout.

"The film ’ is not just an
ordinary gangster movie. The
Cosa‘ Nostra are not despicable or
deviant; rather they are respect-
able citizens of their communi-
ties. They have families for whom
they desire the best. Unlike the
Cagneys or Rafts, who receive
their just rewards in the end—us-
ually death or imprisonment-—-the
Corleones succeed in building
their family on a stronger and
better foundation of crime.

Yet, while the Corleones can
be warm and tender within their
family, they can be ruthless and
brutal
Coppola contrasts these differ-
ent values with adept direction
and skillfully photographed
scenes. Brando’s death scene and

e that ‘of the children playing ball

behind the massive iron gates of
the Corleone "fortress" are ex-
amples of Coppola’s genius.

With, scenes like these

Coppola manages to trans-
form his film from merely a
gangster tale to a movie with a
social commentary on power and
dignity. However. it is the vio-

lence and gallons of bloodshed
that will appeal to the masses
and make it a box office smash.

Marlon Brando, in his "best
role in twenty years, brings credi-
bility to the role of the elder
son— combining man with mons-
ter. Nevertheless, the perform-
ance lacks the brilliance and
intensity of his earlier successes.

Outdoing Braodo for acting
honors was Al Pacino, as Michael
Corleone. From the -younger Mi-
chael refusing involvement with
his family’s “business” to the
Michael inheriting his father’s
position, Pacino’s performance
is flawless. Simply, he IS‘ Michael
Corleon.

While there are too many com-
mendable performances to list
them all, James Caan (Brian’s
Song) as the quick-tempered
Sonny, and Robert Duvall as
the family consigliere (the
lawyer) deserve special mention.
Both have proven themselves
actors to be reckoned with in
future films.

In effect, Coppola has practic-
ally done the impossible by direc-
ting a movie that will appeal not
only to fans of the book,
but also to those who have not
readit.

Calley. and considering the nihil-
istic (but popular) tendencies of
our mind blown‘ (and morally
bankrupt) youth, Kubrick evident-
ly is merely catering to today's
alienated and aesthetically amor-
al generation which wallows in
and glorifies violence and sex.
it is commercial cynicism of the
worst kind.

That Kubrick is a genius I
have little doubt. His ambi-
tious ability to create and pro-
mote a personal mystique, (Ku-
brick has his own highly pro-
fessional public relations staff)
his acute sense of timing (accord-
ing to Variety Clockwork was
ready for release at least six
months before its official Christ-
mas release, but the master
shlockmeister smartly decided to
wait till the end of the year when
the gullible, movie-going public’s
and. critics defenses are at
their lowest and movie-going
pocketbooks are open at their
widest), and his penchant for
tackling only grandiose projects
and turning them into winners

I (at the box office as well as with

the mass media critics, from

       
  
 

i  ”M0nda’yl.

Hollis Allpert to Paul X. Zim-.
merman), are certainly the work
ofagenius. ‘

In fact it is the same type of
genius in which Cecil B. De-

’ Mille and P. T. Barnum excelled. '

They certainly knew how to
give you a good show, and made
money at it too. One need only
check a recent issue of Variety
to learn that 2001 has made a
$31 million profit in spite of in-
dustry "experts" who wrote off
the $11" million space Spartacus
as a big bath backin 1968.

While Clockwork won‘t click
(I'm probably underestimating
the voyeuristic and camp ten-
dencies of my fellow generation)
for as much cash, it'll certainly
make a bundle. '

But what of the music. the
photography, lighting. sets and
action? -While I admit that they
range‘ from mediocre. at
worst, to excellent at ‘best.

about them as Newsweek, Time

than enough free publicity). I

If you ardently believe that ’

act. Seating himself ‘upon his
organ stool, he proceeded immedi-
ately with aninstrumental rendi-
tion of "Changes” which was
followed by "Hey Joe.” He then
introduced‘The Bus"'a song‘ from

’ his forthcoming album.

On “Summertime,” the
George Gershwin tune, Preston
demonstrated his keyboard wiz-
ardry, playing several differ-

ala Ray Charles, Johann Se-

was perhaps the most humorous

part of the set, especially
Preston's baroque-oriented ar-
rangement. The audience re-
sponded appreciatively.

site end of the stage. Preston
first stopped for a song on his
portable organ. after which he
performed a blues-gospel solo on
the piano, movingly praising-
God “for laying Your hands on
me,“ in gratitude for his
extraordinary talent. Not sur-

Medwid, Hogan ready l 

to quarterback offense

by VINCE DI NARDO .
Sports Editor
According to head football coach
Carl DePasqua, Bob Med wid
would be the starting quarterback

_if the Panthers opened thier sea-
3 son against Florida State tomor-

row. That means the Cats would

have undoubtedly committed '

themselves to the wishbone of-
fense.-V V V -

DePasqua is not yet willing to
make that firm a statement. He
seems content, at this’ time, to
comment on the offenses progress
on the execution of the options.

One ‘committment the mentor
is willing to make, however, is
that Medwid is the fronttrunner
for the pilot job, based on the per-
formances so farthis spring.

“Right now," I would rate the

quarterbacks in this order: Med-"

wid, (John) Hogan, (Bill) Daniels,
(Rich)Washinko,” proclaimed

‘ the chilled DePasqua.

On the surface, Medwid would
seem the logical quarterback.
With a reputation" of being a fine
runner and an adequate passer,
the 6-2, 190 pound McKees Rocks
native is fit for the employed of-
fense.

“I think the quarterback has to
be able to read the tackles to see

if he should’ hand off and read the‘

end to see when he should pitch
out,” analyzed Medwid. “Good re-
flexes and quickness also help.”

‘Medwid, who completed 18 of
39 passes last year, a 46 per cent
completion clip, is also more se-
cure about putting the ball in the
air.

“The wishbone ‘employs a more
conservative passing game,” said
Medwid. "The wishbone empha-
sizes the run, but I have confi-
dence in my passing.”

Pitt breezed through the remain-
der of the contest.

After the final buzzer, league
representative Cliff Wise present-
ed the Commissioners’ Cup to as-
sistant captain Kerry Browne.
Browne took the cub, emblematic
of Western Pa. Intercollegiate
Club Hockey Association supre-
macy, and skated around the are-
na with his teammates “ala John
Bucyk-Jean Beliveau style.”

Player-coach Gefsky had noth-
ing but praise for his team’s ef-
forts. “It was our best game of
the year. We outplayed them real-
ly bad; we played our passing
game well and our defense was
good too.”

In the jubilant Pitt locker room
Denny Browne echoed Gefskys’
opinion. “They (Indiana) "are
tough compared to the rest of the

league but they’re not anywhere _

near us.”

303 MEDWID’
mm Runner

The 6-0, 185 pound Hogan does-
n’t carry the same running cre-
dentials as Medwid, but is a bet-
ter passer. The Charleroi athlete

, had the highest completion per-

centage of the quarterbacks last
season. He completed 26 of 49 at-
tempts for a 53 completion per-'
centage.

One might think that a fine
throwing quarterback like Hogan

might feel a little dismayed about A

the wishbone offense.

“The wishbone is a good of-
fense,” said Hogan. “I think it
utilizes the good runners we have

coming back. I’m only an ade-

quate runner, but I have the abil-
ity to pass the ball. The offense
will be a running one. That hurts
my forte, which is passing. But, I
feel I can play and help the team."

Even though Hogan “feelsat a
disadvantage” he didn't sound

like he is ready to submit to Med- I

wid. V r
“I think the offense helps the

team,” continued Hogan.. “Last 

year I had to throw from a lot of
third down and long situations and
I think passing situations will pop
up.” ' ‘ . A
DePasqua also plans to use the

' “"J.,V}") -.. ‘

Power-I, and the triple option of- . oi

fenses which he used last year.
And if the quarterback mortality
rate is half as consistent as last

year, more than these two quar- 

terbacks will see action.

If Medwid'and Hogan could. be '

meshed into one quarterback De-
Pasqua would have some quar-
terback at his disposal. Sinhe this
is unlikely to happen, the fourth
year hoach should feel happy to

have one fine runner and one fine ‘

passer to choose from.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.—The
Pitt mitters barely edged Bing-
hamton of New York, 1-0, at St.
Petersburg and tied the Pitts-
burgh Pirate Rookie team, 5-5.
yesterday afternoon, in a contest
called on account of darkness,to
kick off their southern stay in
Florida.

Pitt Coach Bob Lewis split the
team into two squads. The prob-
able starters for the season open-
er with West Virginia competed
against the Pirate Rookies, while
the rest of the team played Bing-

. hamton.

With freshman second baseman
Rick Monroe leading the way with
a single and an _RBI double, the

diamondmen combined good de-
fense with outstanding pitching in
defeating Binghamton. _

Mike Fedoris hurled three per-
fect innings, striking out seven.
Brother Andy pitching- shutout ball
three more innings, with Mylan
Popovich finishing up on the
mound. -

Assistant Pitt- Coach Al Smith,

commenting on the team’s per-
formance,‘ stated, “We played a
good ball game. Our pitching was

very good and although we could E

have been more« explosive at the
plate, we did well considering it
was our first ball game of the sea-
