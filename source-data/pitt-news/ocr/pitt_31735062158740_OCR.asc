Writer Sees Classic,
‘Madam Bovary,’
A Timely Theme

B3’ OSCAR GOODSTEIN 3
Maclani Bovary, last week’sl
Nixon feature, is an absorbing
drama, almost wholly because
it has a. timely theme.

The story progression and
ending is tragic.‘ It concerns
the not‘ so rare tale of a first
scdlictioii ending in futile sui-
cide. Butfbeyond this, there are
few deeper tragic significances.
These significances are linked di-
rectly with a diversified misin-
terpretation of sex by _each of the
characters concerned.

It is the story of an over-ro-
mantic girl who marries a sexually
frigid husband. Soon after, she
meets her ideal lover with whom
she does not consummate an af-
fair because of his timidity and
her indecision; ultimately and
most unfortunately, she is seduced
by the inevitable “man of exper-
ience.”

Disillusionment . . .

And, though it takes another
act and a half for her to accum-
mulate enough sin to justify a
suicide, the tragic tone swells
chieﬂy from the brief disillusion-
ment of allethese characters. ,

Those‘: who. have guessed, that
this  of discussion inevitably
leads» ta- thee oft-’ repeated’ request
for complete course in eugenics
are right-——but only partly right.
The mood left from the play is
likely to spur a request for some-
thing more than a mere technical
course. It is more apt to urge an
opportunity for students to meet
in classrooms that will develop
the kind of attitudes that will not
end in the denounement of the
play, disillusionment.

“Why," the college portion of
the audience asks,.;;‘,are_~we denied
such an opportunity?‘ Surely, it is
evident that unashamed discussion
of sex creates greater respect for
the subject."

The Victorian age, the period
of the play, was unwilling to talk
about sex. Every reader of Vic-
torian literature discovers that un-
derneath its overt virtue, the age
had little to write hymns about.

Creatures Allure . . .
Re_fusal»to-offer a course in sex
education anywhere serves to cre-
ate only an. intriguing allure to
sex immorality. Those who refuse
to offer the course can find little
solace in this phase at the subject.

Perhaps _there is an objection to
permitting college men and wo-
men to attend co-educational eu-
genics classes. This should not be.
When a collegeman and woman
speak=..ab,o,ut matters of sex, the
attitude invariably is respectful.

It has been said by some of the
students at the University that
few':«‘col_1¢g¢,'? f-people f are naive
enough to heed a eugenics course.
They will find their answer in the
“Madame 3 Bovary” marriages of
real life.

Somehow, although the theme
of the play "'is"familiar, it seemed
none the less pathetic. Man’s eter-
nal,'a’nd' oftenpitiful, attempt to
bringout the sexual being th"'at’
lives within, and dissect it is only
too poignantly revealed‘ in the
final"words of Madam Bovary as
he contemplates his wife, lifeless
on her bed:—“Who were you, my
wife?” C

After which comes another
question,’ “Has SFA attended the
theatre recently?”

Dr. Goldblatt
Publishes Text

Dr. L. A. Goldblatt, instructor
in chemistry, now teaching at the
Erie Center, will have published
by D. Appleton-Century com-
pany this months another chemist-
ry text. His new book is patterned
after',his “Collateral Readings in
Organic Chemistry.”

Dr._ Goldb1att’s method of deal-
ing with the problem of interest-
ing chemistry students in the lit-
erature of chemistry, was well re-
ceived. upon. the publication of his
book on organic readings.

Thebookreproduces 32 impor-'
tant articles from technical jour-
nals and gives biographical data
about the author. It is particu-
larly valuable as a means of bring-
ing textbooks up-to—date and of
providing a source of material for
industrial ﬁrms with limited li-
brary facilities.

Robert N. Waddell, ‘Republican candidate for mayor of
Pittsburgh, will not speak tonight at the YM-YWCA spon-
sored Institute on ,M,_unic-ipal Affairs. . ‘

Scheduled to appear on the Institute program with Mayor
Cornelius D. Scully, -Democratic candidate, Mr. \Va.ddelli an-
nounced late _v-esterday through his~'campa.ign n1an.a}gers‘ that
he would not be presentat the meeting, which begins ‘toda.y~_at‘

4 o’clock in the Y clubrooms, Forbes

the institute, set. for 7 o’clock,

chairman. Otherparts of the pro-
gram remain unchanged, says
Springer, with Mayor jS_cully
speaking at the evening session,
and Dr. B. J. Hovde, _a'jsso_ci‘ate
professor of history and ‘city Adi-
rector of public welfare, leading

the afternoon ‘meetings.

‘NOT NOTIFIED’ '

“Mr. Wadde1l’s managers,” de-
clares Springer, “said that he
would not speak at ._ the-. Institute
meeting ' because our program
committee did not give him a list
of the campaign issues to be dis-
cussed until one day later ‘than
they had promised. On Monday
his managers refused my offer
that Mr. Waddell speak only on
issues selected by himself.”

At the first session of the In-.

stitute (4 o’clock), Dr. Hovde
-will attempt to isolate issues he-
hind the mayoralty fight in a dis-
cussion on “What Pittsburgh
Needs.”

After Dr. Hovde’s talk, students
will engage in an open forum to
formulate the questions to be sub-
mitted to Mr. Scully and Mr.
Clunk. The Institute will continue
with a social session at 5:30 o’clock
and supper, scheduled for 6:15
o’clock. ‘

SCULLY QUESTIONED
, Mayor Scully and Mr.‘ Clunk
will meet at the ﬁnal session, at
7’o’cIock, when they will answer
the- questions prepared by stu-
dents at the afternoon meeting.

Spokesmen for the Allegheny
County Republican executive
committee indicated that the
meeting is only a Democratic at-
tempt to put Mr. Waddell “on the
spot,” with Dr. Hovde, a member
of Mr. Scully’s cabinet, leading
the discussion on campaign is-
sues. , “

“Since” Mr. Waddell has chal-
lenged Mr. Scully to an open de-
bate on campaign issues, I con-
sider it fair that he at least speak,
not necessarily debate, on some
issues, especially when an inde-
pendent organization like ours
sponsors the ‘ meeting,” said
Springer.

Waddell Replies
‘I Robert N. Waddell’s statement
released through the Allegheny
County‘ Republican executive
committee, declining the invitation
‘to speak at today’s YMCA Insti-
tute on Municipal Affairs:

I am declining-with regret an
 invitation to speak at arproposod

, open forum‘ -Wednesday night,’
under the auspices of an Insti-
tute of Municipal Affairs, sup-
posedly being; staged «or the
YMCA and the YWCA of the
University, of Pittsburgh. _

V I am doing so because I have
received no information from
them as to the nature of this
proposed open forum, nor in
what manner it will be conduct-_,

’ ed, nor to what sort of an inter
rogation from a possible par-
tisan audience the candidate
might be subjected.

I note that on the program a
member of the Democratic Ma-
yor’s cabinet is listed as a prin-
cipal speaker. Also I am inform-
ed that one of the chief spon-
sors of this Institute is one of
the assistant secretaries to the
Mayor, and that another leader
is an ardent Democrat.

I. stated“ at the beginning of.
this. campaign that. I? would‘ open-
ly face’ the Democratic, candi-
date in a series of joint debates,
whereby we could insure equal-
ly partisan audiences. It will be
recalled I proposed engaging
one of the large public halls
where we would appear jointly
and discuss vital issues, with
subjects to be determined in ad-
vance. I ‘ further proposed we
would each distribute half of the

so the audience would be fair.
That proposition still holds good,
but has never been accepted. _
Until such time as the Demo-
cratic candidate sees fit to ac-
cept my challenge on a fair basis,
I must decline to enter into any
joint discussions about which I
know nothing previously of the
set-up.

Prediction
Fraternity Bids
Provide Opportunity
For Wild Betting‘

By ROBERT BROVVN

Once more it is the middle of
October, and once more the seers

ley and Biddle, assistant deans of
men, and Edward Williams, di-
rector of the _ placement bureau,
have a wager made that whoever
makes _the best guess will win a
ﬁve-dollar gasoline courtesy card.

Mr. Corley’s estimate will be
given ﬁrst, partly because he is in
charge of fraternity rushing, and
partly because he managed to top.
Mr. Biddle last year. Mr. Corley
believes that the thirteen houses
on campus will issue 645 bids,
with 425 individual bids, of which
there will be 190 acceptances.

Mr. Wil.1iams goes slightly high-
er in the first count with a total
of 650 bids, agrees with Mr. Cor-
ley on the second ﬁgure by plac-
ing it at 425, but goes down the
scale by going on record that only
175 freshmen will accept.

Something they may have recalled also is

the socio-economic-politico history of the coun-

behind other European governments socially

Church controlled the natural resources‘ and
the Spanish peasant worked for more sub-
sistence. The newly-arrived-at. democracy was
.-sabotaged’ by‘ reactionanes.

. An example of Rebel propaganda which In-
quiry goers may have read in the daily press
is the following United Press dispatch:

“GVIB-RALTAR, Oct. 11 — President.

R-oosevelt’s recent speech on pea;ce-d-isturb-

ing nations won high praise from General

Gonzalo Qui-epo de Llano, Spanish rebel

leader, famed for his broadcasts from Se-

-‘ville.

“Clearly, Quiepo def Llano said, the

Speech. was intended to condemn the Span-
ish Loyalist government and the govern-
ments of France and Russia for intervening’
it-'L.'Spain.” ~
..If the Insurgent army should gain victory
within the next three months or later, we see
but one outcome: Signal victories for the Nazis
and Fascists, a» modernized feudalism, a sup-
pression of the freedom for which Spanish

chaos on the international scene.

' ‘By Milton G..L.e-I-1-man,..]r. _‘

Casting aside investigation of schizophrenics and:
choretics for the moment, a handful of -unortiiodox
psychologists. have recently taken up the intriguing:
problem of mental telepathy by means of the radio.
Last Sunday night we‘ heard one of their broad‘-'
casts.

We have in the past taken small interest, less be-
lief in the arguments of believers in telepathy,
holding it as so much publicity placed on common-
place coincidence. We had heardi the now platitu-
dsinous statement that “it is strange‘ that there’ are
not more coincidences considering how‘ ma-riyr pos-
sibilities" for them are presented every day’.’’ And‘
we were apt to agree.

In normal, everyday life: including speech, activ-
ity, and thought, coin’cidences—-or‘ the common re-
sponse of two individuals’ at the identical‘ moment
—do not take place with amazing frequency. Co-
incidences are infrequent, therefore it" is small won-
der that notice is taken of their occurence. We
are not of the mathematical mind, and we" cannot‘
guess at the number of coincidental possibilities
that never materialize.

As we were intimating, we" were prone to scoff
at the claims of the radio psychologists. Their
methods were, however, largely scientiﬁc. Origi-
nating in a studio in Chicago, the telepathetic pro-
gram was introduced by several playlets in which
strange coincidence (or telepathy) was dramatized.

The test itself followed. Five men and ﬁve
women in the studio concentrated on black and
white, seeking to transmit their thoughts to the
“unseen audience.” Seven trials were made, with
short intermissions between each period of con-
centration.

There were three of us around our radio, ea-ch
concentrating (and looking absent-minded as well-)
marking down our hunches on separate pieces of
paper. None of us were able to see the-“B” or “W”
symbols on the paper of the other.

We‘ haven-’t heardi yet the actual selections, but
when we compared our results following the broad-
lcasts, we‘ found the following:

to maintain the.-people of Madrid,

FOREIGN AID.

Strength of the -Nationalist
forces, which have increased to
overwhelming proportions in re-
cent months, should assure Franco

of‘ a victory, Father Ferge-ru de-

clared. F'oi'ei-g'ners aiding‘ Franco,
he said, include 4,000 Germans in
the technical and. communications
services, and about 30,000 Italian
troops, no longer engaged in
ﬁghting.

Airplanes on both sides have
been furnished by; foreign powers,
he continued. All planes oper-
ated -by the government, are of
Russian make, and the Nationalist
forces use Italian and German
ships. . « -

“Spain will not be ruled. per-
manently by ac Fascist. govern-

ment if the Nationalists win the-

war. Of" course, a mi-li-tary dicta-
torship will be necessary to ‘keep
.order for four or ﬁve--i years, but I
be~l~ieve= that they‘ gover-nme-‘n’c will
revert then, to_ a- constitutional
corplor-ative is-fate‘, with a partial
return to the monarchy. The-new

king will probably be Princes

John, third. son. of. ex-king; Al-
fonso,-’.’ ' Father Ii‘-ei'g_ei-2 said.‘

“Any-: a,-‘ctemptt to... impose-* a

declared-.. “Spaniards are~not—:t-he-

kincl-'of persons whb}. will stand’-for
a totalitarian, . state .3’ The Spaniard
is primarily an’ individualist; he
takes his political beliefs more
seriously than his" religion O1-‘,hlS

Answering the charge that Gen-
eral , Franco. and his Nationalist
armies" are the,agents_, for the re-
actionary .larl_d—o.wne-rs, who domi-
nated-.S,p_ain before the war, Fath-
er Ferger explained that the gov-
ernment gave no police;-protection
to opponents of the Communists
who seized power after the Feb-
ruary, 1936, election. V 0 ‘

‘JOIN, RULE!’

The speaker charged" that the
Communists‘ seized control of the
government by applying to the
other liberal parties the theory. of
“joining them and‘ then ruling
them if you can_’.t beat them.”
Rightist parties actually. won the
last election by over 200,.000"votes,
according‘ to Father Eerger.

Repeated outrages against mem-
bers of the Rightist groups by
mobs tacitly encouraged by the
government provoked Francois ‘re-

bellion, he stated.- As part of the"

mob rule which. followed the elec-
tion, over 500- churches were de-
stroyed in two months after -the
Communist‘ government’ assumed‘
control, he said;

Policy of Treatment of Japan
May Be Dilemma in Brussels

By JOSEPH McGLO’SK‘EY

The statesmen of the leading world powers will be in an ex-
ceedingly difﬁcult position when they meet in Brussels to deter-

mine a policy with regard to Japan.

Deﬁnite commitments

will be necessary if the Japanese aggression in China is-to be
stopped, and deﬁnite commitments are the bane of any diplo-

mat ’s existence.

First‘, if the nations of Europe expect the United States to
take the lea.d in any steps against Japan, the United. States

must‘ be assured that cooperationé

is forthcoming. Any indication
that th'e*American Department of
State is again to be left outon. a
limb will drive the United States
into an ironclad isolationist pol-
icy, a movewhich would be high-
ly prejudicial to the cause of
world peace.‘
JA'PA‘N:* PROGRESSES .

Second, indetermlning a. policy
to apply to -Japan, the ‘ statesmen
are confronted: by the“ fact‘ that
J pan, while stymied in. Shang-
hai, is making‘ deﬁnite progress in
the interior and will-belextremely
unwilling to abandon a successful
war to gather around a mediation
table, what with ‘winter coming
on.

As a result, the Powers must-
make strong representations to
Japan and must, in addition, be
prepared to enforce those repre-
sentations by recourse to arms, if
necessary. For the present‘situa-
tion grows out of the failure-of
the nations of the world to move
decisively in 1932, when the im-
perial ambitions of Japan could
have been nipped in the bud.

NEEDS RESOURCES

Should Japan succeed in consol-

idating her gains in nothern China.

and in the valley of the Yellow
River, she will be in possession of
markets and resources, the lack
of which at present constitutes the
greatest weakness in Japan’s eco-
nomic structure. . . --

But here the statesmenrun into
another snag. Any action against
Japan will institute reprisals.‘And
the distance from Tokyo to Hong
Kong is tremendously shorter than
is the distance from London. to

Hong Kong. All of which indi--

cates that Chinamay again-be im-
paled upon the-cross of diplomatic
expediency and Japan permitted
to seek her. diestiny..a.s. she will.

One oflthe problems of students isto ﬁnd a good. place to

eat, cheaply.

Despite the more aiiundant life at Pitt, we still

must. get our own lunches. So niany sighs of relief were heaved
this year as students found their eateries still doing lmsiness

in the same place.
ters emerged with a modern.

the Culinaire. And‘ Pitt. students%

with slightly sufficient purses like
the place.

Curiously‘ enough, it once was
more than a pretty blue-and-white
restaurant.’ The, brothers of the
Kappa Sigma sign dwelt there,
andwhen they moved,_there came
the brothers from Pi? Kappa Alpha.
In betwixt were men from Med-
ical School.

So the other day, eating in the
Culinaire, Ted Biddle, assistant
dean of men, looked around‘ at the
waitresses dashing. up and down
the stairs, the Dutch-home clean-
liness of the place. “I used to
sleep in this room,” he said. Back
in the‘ Pika days, Ted‘ Bidd1e‘s
room was this front‘ one.

Eating with Ted Biddle were
Carl Cass, Pitt Players’ director,

and his new assistant’, Buell
Whitehill, Oscar Goodstein, the
Players’ President‘; and busi-

ness manager Jim Davis. The gent-
ry promise that Pitt‘ Players are
going: to go high this year, what
with “Fresh Fields-” as their first
play in‘ the new Foster Memorial,
and “Ceiling Zero?’ and “Accent
On Youth” coming later.-

Irene Matveak, last year’s Pitt
Panther editor, had. offers for
eighteen jobs this fall. She took
one with a big advertising com-
pany .
stormed down to the ﬂoor, “Who
in the devil is this smart freshman
who signs his dean’s name?” The
name was E. A. Holbrook, and, of
course, it tuned out that the head
of. the school of engineering and
mines has his son, Junior, here at
Pitt. But don’t call him Junior.

In a second-hand book which
belonged to Irene Long, the Shorty
Long of the Pitt News: “Poker:

low that is scribbled: “Mayme
Madden, att-or-knees at law; Ir-

outof bed an hour -early this ’ morn-
ing. Assistant "track coach James
Potts and the officials ofthe meet
spent all of yesterday afternoon
checking the stop watches -and
starting gun, and the entrants
made .a final inspection of their
track spikes and had theirtrack
suits washed and pressed.

The meet will start off with the

 mile run, followed by the 440-yard
3 dash, the 100-y-ard dash, the 120-
': yard ,low hurdles, the 880-yard
‘ dash, the .220-yard dash, the two

mile run, and the 220 yard low

Most of the field‘ events are
scheduled for Thursday afternoon,
but the high jump and the javelin
throw will be contested Wednes-
day afternoon. I

100 ’ENTERED«
Olson: is satisfied with ‘the num-

ber of entrants, but “no more than:
satisfied” to put it in‘Mr. O1son’s

words. The entry list goes well
over the hundredmark and, al-
though it will not equal the en-
trance figures of‘ some past tour-
neys, it will compare favorably

with the number of entrants that

ran in the affair last year.
Although the meet is scheduled
to start this afternoon, leaving no
time for last minute entrants to
"get into shape, Olson will still
accept tardy entrants. Boys en-

tering the meet today" should fill

out the blank appearing in the
News today and .be on hand at
three ofclock in the stadium.

This novice meet is the biggest
event on the fall track program.
In fact Olson considers entrance
in the novice 'meet;the fourth most
important step in a man’s life, the
other three being birth, marriage,
and death.

STARS ARE BORN

Following his theory that “you
don’t have to have been a high
school track star to take a crack
at track” Olson urges all boys to
enter the affair regardless of size,
shape, or experience. Furtherin
line with his theory Olson believes
that track stars turn up in the
strangest people.

In the past Olson uncovered
such track stars as Johnny Wood-
ruff, Dick Mason, Leonard Par-
sons, and Harold«Tost in his novice
meet. And he figures that if he
carries a horseshoe in his hip
pocket he may spot himself an
Olympic champion or at least a
varsity start or two among the
long entry list.

But whether or not there are
any future track men competing
in the meet he is taking no chances
of overlooking any of them if they
are entered. In the past he has
been the judge of the meet, but
this year the meet will be an all-
student affair leaving Olson and
Potts plenty of time to observe
the runners.

Fred Kiger, Dick Mason, and
Eugene Taano will take care of
the’ stop watches, starting guns,
and records.

No one knows who will be the
winners, but it is a safe bet that

this novicetourney is just the be- _

ginning of a long run in Pitt track
for the boys who finish in the
one, two, three spots and even for
some that don’t finish in the first
three.

The Pitt News
Dear Sir:

I enclose this
News:
“Missouri-‘Vlichigan —- Are we
nuts?" We feellike takingthe Wol-
verines. Better judgmentsays that
the Gophers can’t play ‘three bad
games in a row. .It’s Beirman’s
boys by sheer power only.”
I am inclined to think you are;
Jules Labarthe,-J r.
It took only an instant ’to dis-
cover that Michigan didn’t play
Missouri. And if Missouri had
played Michi‘gan»we' shouldn’t have
called them the_Gophers as they
aren’t .ca-l_le.d- the Gophers. Besides,
Missouri’s coach isn’t named Bier-
.man (nor Beirman either). The
Gophers is the name given to the
Minnesota team, and Bierman is
their coach. .Inci.den.tally, Minne-
sota is the.-{team that didj~'.play Mi-
chigan last Saturday.
They played for the “little
brown jug.” It would almost
seem" as ifwthe trophy had been
sampled befoiethe paragraph was
written. That is categorically de-
nied. ' '

’ from Friday’s

that the mistakes were «made to

‘the negative would almost have
«been the answer but for the keen
eye of Dr. Laba-rthe, senior indus-
trial fellow in the Mellon Insti-
tute. '

When asked how he happened

"is an in-veteratefollower of sports
pages, and seeing this error in an
otherwise “excellent” column (the
’‘‘excellent’’ is his) he“-‘thought"he
could ‘poke at little fun and call it
to the editor’s attention at -the
same time.

But really it wasn’tAincluded to
test the readers,‘ and Dr. Labarthe
(out of 5000 readers) caught the
staff in an off moment. He’s a
close friend of Dr. John B. "Jock’
Sutherland, and that probably ex-
plains his ability.

Extension Reg-i‘si5tration
Increases 12

THE PITT NEWS

Per Cent .

Classes Held
In 23 District
Centers

Rising agaiii to pre-depress-
ion heights, with an increase
of 12 per cent over last yea.r’s
enrollment, the University’s

ing classes in 28 centers from
Eric to Uniontown, and from
J ohnstovvn to Bellaire, Steuben-
ville, and Youngstown.

With 36 members of the staff of
the University conducting these

classes, more than 1,400 out-of-
town students are able to work
for degrees in the evenings. Com-
bining these classes with Saturday
morning classes and summer
courses, many people who earn
their own living are able to get
degrees in a comparatively short
time. -

Staff members are assigned to
the Extension Division and do the
teaching as part of their full time
teaching load. Thus, the exten-
sion courses are regular University
courses, and not something the
professor offers as a class in his
spare time. Courses are offered in
the College, and Schools of Educa-
tion, Engineering, and Business
Administration. A -

"At"~tlie Westinghouse plant, en-
gineers with University degrees de-
cided that they would like to work-
for graduate degrees. Joining the
extension classes, and combining-
these with summer and Saturday
morning courses, they will soon be
able to get these degrees without
stopping their work.‘

Besides.-engineers, teachers as a
group are the most ‘consistent stu-
dents in the extension classes. In
fact, so great is their demand for
University classes, that it prompts
F. W- Shockley, director of the

'ext.ensiondivision>-‘to remark, “I

don’t know of any place in the
United States where you’d find
a greater interest,_amon.g teachers’
groups -in progressive education
than in the Western Pennsylvania
area.”

Big Apple
I-F Yuletide Event
Appropriates Fad

With only 66 shopping days
until Christmas, and only 58
days until the I-F Yuletide fes-
tival, chairman Jackson M. Sig-
mon, C38, is jumping the gun
(and incidentally beating out
all the other dance chairmen)
by announcing that the official
introduction of the “Big Apple”
will take place at his dance.

Besides the introduction "of
the “Shag,” Sigmon has used
his wiles on the women, by
getting the women’s fraterni-
ties to eliminate the Pan-Hel-
lenic‘ Informal, and ‘going along
with the male Greeks in spon-
s o r i n g t h e Christmas-time

‘‘It’s a sma1l'be'gin::1ing,” says

. Sigmon, “but  bring

Mines School
Gains National
Recognition  "

Chancellor John G. Bowman has
been notiﬁed by the Engineers’
Council for professional develop-
ment, of New York, that they have
approved and fully accredited the
four-year courses in petroleum re-

fining and engineering of the
School of Mines.
. In February, 1936, all of the

University courses in the Schools
of Engineering and Mines were
inspected bythe Council (which
is the nationalvaccrediting body
for engineering schools) . and . all.
were approved and accredited ex-
cepting ‘ petroleum reﬁning.

At the,time,,the Council stated
that since "the University’s refin-
ing and petroleum engineering de-
partments were the only ones in
the East, it would be necessary
to defer action until similar de-
partments at, engineering schools
in the ,:West and Southwest could
be examined for purposes of com-
parison. The fact that the Uni-
versity’;'.; courses are now ac-
credited is ample evidence of high
comparative standing.

Only one other mining and
metallurgy school in the East, that
at Columbia University, has_ been
accredited by V the Engineers’
Council. The Council’s investigat-
ors spent two’ days ‘ here going
throughthej mining school “with
a fi’ne-toothcomb,” Elmer A. _Hol-
brook, dean of the School’ of En-
gineering and ~Mines, said.

The result is that he is more of
a pessimist than ever. He places
the general bids at 603, states that
the individual bids will total 409.
He does believe that there will be
181 acceptances.

From present indication, it
seems that Mr. Corley will get the
gas. He ran second to Mr. Seidle,
former director of the placement
bureau, who got a dozen golf balls
through the deal last year. Mr.
Williams is a new man, and it may
take him a few more years to get
into the spirit of wild abandon

Mr. Biddle, even with his scien-
