Choices

by Caitlin Kasunich
Staﬂ Wrz'[er

A law passed in former President
George W Bush’s last days of oﬂice
might make it harder for people to re-
ceive medical treatments some health
care workers ﬁnd objectionable, such as
birth controlorabortions.

On Sunday,  two days before
PresidentBarad< Obama’s inauguration,
the Department of Health and Human
Services  the “conscience
rule,”whichBushissuedonDec 19.

This broad new law allows anyone
 in the medical ﬁeld, from doc-
tors who treat patients no receptionists
who answer phone calls and book ap
pointrrients, to reﬁise no  medical
helpwhentheythinktherequestedtreat—
mentismorallyobjectionable.

These trearrnents could include,
but are not limited to, birth oontrol pills,
aneigencycontmoeption —alsomlled
the  or Plan B —and

Medical workers who are forced to
give treatments they find morally objec-

‘Quite honestly, were shocked that

it more diﬂicult for people to access the

Dr l\/Ian: \W1cclair, a professor of
philosophy at Pit1’s Center for Bioethics
and Health Ltvt; said he thinks many
of the lavtfs opponents believe that it is
too broad and includes lots of activities
that are  related to the medical
services,suchasclmningtheinstrurnents

Market Central re-opens

by Drew Singer
New Editor

Market Central and the other dining
establishments beneath the Towers Lobby
were back in operation yesterday, less than
48 hours after a ﬂood forced workers to
evacuate the premises.

This ﬂood came in the same weekend
as a ﬂood in Nordy’s Place in the W/illiam
Pitt Union.

“In both instances, it was a case of
frozen sprinkler,” said Pitt spokesman
John Fedele.

Officials do not yet have an estimate
on the cost of the ﬂood damages.

Hinton, page 6

The problem isn’t that we are any
greedier or less reﬁned than we
used to be. The problem is that
our society has gotten too good
at what it does.

We are too efﬁcient to allow
large paychecks to go to hermetic
ponderers and those who engage
only in coffee-shop discussion.
No matter how much I laud in-
tellectual pursuits, they will con-
tinue to be anomalous in a world
where post—Fordian resourceful-
ness shaves time and money with
the ﬁne blade of Blackberrys and
Google.

So, do we just throw our
hands in the air and hope for the
best? Benda wrote in the ’20s, and
morality and culture haven’t com-

pletely evaporated yet.

One glimmer of hope seems
to materialize in the way of the
blogosphere. While intellectual
activity might suffer a critical
blow in the shift away from ten-

ured faculty, legitimate thought  

 

is ﬁnally ﬁguring out how to best if A H

exploit the Internet.
By networking thinkers, we

might be able to collectively   

achieve what we will lose the 

means to do ourselves. If schol-
ars ﬁnd themselves havinglto get

“real” jobs and culture decides

to stop tolerating the impracti— V

cal philosopher, the blogosphere
suggests the birth of the meta-
thinker. Bits of thought might
shoot back and forth between
like-rninded communities of
thinkers to turn the wheels of
disinterested intellectualism when
pure authors are no longer pos-
sible.

Benda wrote that this problem
is “more important than all politi-
cal upheavals.” We must approach
it with similar solemnity.

CrunchPad packs the punch without the price

 
   
   

by Donald Campbell V
Colummltt

Gone are the days when expen-
sive necessarily meant cooler.

The original Macintosh all—in-
one computer, which seemed to
revolutionize the  computer
industry, originally cost $4,000. A

4 college student looking for a good

machine wouldn’t dream of spend-
ing that much.

In fact, many computer manu-
facturers ﬁnd a proﬁtable and wide-
spread marketplace for cut-down

machines, capable of performing .

tasks adequately and without any
wasted power. \W1th the ability to cut
down the specifications of hardware
comes the ability to cut the price.
Netbooks, as they are  la-
beled, commonly can cost around
$300, a small amount of money

when compared to the expenditures '

required to purchase full—ﬂedged
laptops. ,

The one  that hasn’t been
on the horizon is the availability of a
touchscreen or tablet netbook. The

RESEARCH STUDY

DEPRESSED?      
SMOKING MARIJUANA

‘Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
are recruiting people ages l4 to 25 for a medication

research study. we are seeking people who feel
depressed and smoke moriiuana. Participants will receive

technology had been assumed to be '

simply too costly to cut the price by
half or more. -

An article recently posted on
TechCrunch, an online blog about
new technological development ef
forts, blew away previous wisdom

about the price requirements of tab-

let computers The article is an up-
date on an initially proposed project
to develop a tablet Internet machine
for $200.

The CrunchPad prototype, as
the group developing it is  it, is
a MacBook-esque device, complete
with a color to_uch—screen and Wi-
Fi Internet capabilities It currently
runs a port of Ubuntu Linux, and
the price goal is appearing to be al-
luringly close. “Just over $200.”

Two immediate thoughts should
come to mind when you read the
above report First, is it a “full-fea-
ture ” tablet? Also, why was it only
mentioned as an Internet machine?
Put most simply, no it is not techni-
cally a “full—featured” tablet, and de-
signers only mentioned the Internet
because of the fact that the design-
ers created the rnachine primarily for
Internet usage. '

an evaluation that includes 'a physical exam, study

medication, and treatment for three months at no cost. -

Participants will be compensated after each visit.

All calls are conﬁdential.

Their idea is rather ingenious and
simple If you cut down the adver-
tised capabilities of the machine,
you can cut down the hardware re-
quired and thereby the price. The
CrunchPad runs first and foremost
a browser.

They're idea is rather
ingenious and simple.
If you cut down the
advertised capabilities
of the machine, you
can cut down the
hardware required and

thereby the price. 

From pictures given of the ma-
chine, however, it is a full-featured
browser, capable of displaying Web
site at a resolution of lO24—by-768
pixels If this is completely mean-
ingless to you, suffice it to say that
most Internet sites can be comfort-
ably and attractively displayed at that
resolution.

User input is taken care of us-

ing a keyboard emulation tool that
responds to a user’s touch. The
keyboard appears to be of standard
QWERTY co tion. V
The most attractive aspect of it is
that it runs on an Intel Atom-equiv-
alent processor. The Intel Atom is a
small, low-energy processor used in
many modern Netbooks and some
small desktops. The CrunchPad
should, for “just over $2 ,” be able
to keep up ﬁne with the middle range
of Netbooks currently available
You might still be skeptical, how-
ever, that a machine only capable
of displaying the Internet is of any
use Think this over, though. As In-
ternet technology progresses, more
and more ‘applications may become
browser-based. A significant num-
ber of office tasks performed on
computers can be fully replicated by
using Google’s suite of online tools.
The only shortcoming may
be those who wish to play video
games.
The CrunchPad, like other Net-
books, however, is not powerful
enou.gh to be of much use in the

gaming world, regardless of its sta-
tus as an “Internet-only’ ’ device.

The CrunchPad is also billed
as  capable of fully display-
ing browser—embedded movies and
Flash and Java files This inevitably
opens the user up to a wider range
of -browser-based applications and
thus greatly increases the usefulness
of the CrunchPad

Special attention has been 
to user as well For those
who are fond of the Apple propen-
sity to put accelerometers in their
devices,  the device the ability
to respond to shaking or a change
in orientation, the CrunchPad offers
similar technology.

I  the orientation of the
CrunchPad will cause the machine
to change its view, allowing you
to view pages that require greater
length or greater width or to simply
View more of an image at once with-
out scrolling

The best part about the project,
however? The team indicates that
further research into cost—effective
case and display teclmology may
yield a device that is just less than
$200. That’s a modest bar tab for

Big East tough for Pitt Women, too

Pitt senior guard Shavonte Zellous scored 29 points during Pitt's 76-40 pounding of

On Saturday night at Louisville’s Freedom
Hall, the Cardinals took it to the No. 1-ranked
Pitt men’s basketball team to upset the Panthers
69-63 in a typical, competitive Big East rnatchup.

Earlier that day at the Peterson Events Cen-
ter, another hard-fought Big East showdown be-
gan. Almost halfway through the ﬁrst half, South
Florida led the Pitt womenh team 13-11, holding
the Panthers to 4-of-15 shooting.

The men’s side of the Big East has been de-
scribed by ESPN analysts and armchair experts
as the toughest conference in college basketball
But the women’s side might be just as strong
from top to bottom.

“If you look ahead in this league you will ,

be frightened,” said Pitt coach Agnus Berenato.
“You can’t look ahead.”

After a 10-2 record out of conference, Pitt
began conference play 2-2, losing to both Provi-
dence and DePaul —— losses that showed Pitt
that if it didn’t play its best basketball one night, it
wouldn’t get the win.

“The Big East is tough,” said Pitt senior guard
Shavonte Zellous ‘‘\We went through that with
the two—game losing str .”

Recruiting 13-year-olds? Sounds great

by Adam Littman

   

Choosing where to go to college is a momen-
tous decision for anyone,  a student ath-
lete

After years of  school, work and
athletic activities,  to coaches and 
schools, the time ﬁnally comes to pick a college
Butwhywaitallthose years and do allof thatte-
dious stuff?

If you’re a male basketball player, you’re in luck

the deﬁnition of a prospect from a ninth—grader
to a seventh-grader. Finally, 13-year-olds can be
properly recruited by college basketball coaches

aboyaskforthantocommittoplayingforKan-

Cleaﬂy, this seems extreme. But the NCAA
felt the change was necessary because some col-

lege coaches were  camps for elite seventh

and eighth grade basketball players,  those
coaches alegup on the recruitingprocess Since
those seventh and eighth graders vveren’t consid-
ered prospects, the NCAA oouldn’t regulate the
camps

These kids are 13. It’s ridiculous There’s not
only plenty of time before college, butin those ﬁve
years, much of one’s physical and mental matura-
tion takes place The average 13-year-old probably

Plus, what 13-year-old is ready to even start

13, I still thoughtlhad an outside shot at

much for me, but Pll bet I wasn’t the only 13-year-
old who based his career path on Saturday morn-
ing cartoons.

It’s hard to blame a 13-year-old for  along ‘

with the recruitment process, though To them,
it’s probably cool to have the attention of college
coaches
