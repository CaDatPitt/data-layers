SGB starts Pitt
letter writing push

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

As a result of its budget ﬁndings in
Harrisburg, the Student Govern-
ment Board is urging Pitt students to
write their legislators and voice con-
cern over cuts in student aid pro-
posed by the Reagan administration
for fiscal year I986.

The letter-writing campaign -
entitled “Help Us Help You” —
began yesterday when SGB
circulated letter-writin g kits on cam-
pus. The handouts include cover
letter, congressional address lists
and a mailing envelope. The SGB
has made them available at tables in

the Towers, and has distributed -

them to resident mail boxes and at
engineering and pharmacy lectures.

“We want students to write to
their congressmen and explain their
personal situations,” said SGB pres-
ident Luke Kluchko. “Taking the
letter home to their parents is
equally important.”

The proposed cuts would reduce
student aid funding by $2.3 billion
and cut off one million of the 5.3
million students now receiving fed-
eral aid. This negative impact could
involve as much as 20 percent of
Pitt’s 35,000 students.

The Reagan budget would deny
low-interest guaranteed loans to stu-
dents from families earning above
$32,500 annually, place a $4,000-
per-year cap on total federal aid per
student and eliminate grants, direct
loans and subsidized jobs for stu-
dents from families with incomes
over $25,000. The proposal also stip-
ulates that to receive any aid, a stu-
dent must contribute at least $800
per year to his own education costs.

William J. Bennett, newly

 

Stalled

impasse.

Talks between United Steelworkers and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel have come to an

appointed secretary of education,
has been identified strongly with the
reduction proposals due to his
enthusiastic support of student aid
cuts. At a news conference last
month, Bennett accused the nation’s
colleges of “poor management, ill-
conceived curriculums” and “not
delivering on their promises." He
went on to say that the cuts “may
require for some students, divesti-
ture of some sorts  stereo divesti-
ture, automobile divestiture, three
weeks at-the—beach divestiture.”

Kluchko said he feels the ad minis-
trative stance here remains largely
behind the scenes. “Of course they
are concerned with the cuts,” he
said. “It would mean about an $8
million loss for them. But most of
their effort is through lobbying and
personal contacts.” '

Kluchko noted that the Pitt
administration has been very sup-
portive of the letter-writing cam-
paign and has acted in an advisory
capacity during SGB’s three-week
preparation for distribution of the
kits.

He is not pleased with the level of
student apathy, however. “This is a
conservative school, [and] we are
going to have to really overdo itjust
to get a small reaction,” he said. “I
think you could put MX missiles on
Fifth Avenue and 1 don’t think there
would be any student reaction.”

Apathy isn‘t a problem for Pitt
junior Mark Auerbach. He is repre-
sentative of the students who will be
hurt by cuts in aid.

“I think students should be pro-
testing and should be fighting the aid
system and its inefficiencies,"
Auerbach said. “The only way you
can make it work is by fighting it.
But I think part of the apathy is
because their parents are the ones
making the financial decisions. The
students are, unfortunately, pretty
much removed.”

Chevron

By Jon Williams
The Pitt News
The University of Pittsburgh

announced Monday that it had
received the donation of the 54-
building, 85-acre Harmarville
Research Center from Gulf Oil Cor-
poration, a subsidiary of Chevron
Corporation.

The proposal, known since late
February to be going before the
Board of Directors of Chevron, has
sent shockwaves through the local
community as well as the state.

Pitt’s_ executive vice president,
Jack Freeman, said, “There are
numerous ways in which we’ll be
able to use this facility. It will
improve economic development in
Western Pennsylvania, if not the rest
of the state as well."

Acquisition of the plant will allow
Pitt’s faculty to expand their
research while staying close to
campus.

Freeman said receiving the
research center opens new oppor-
tunities to Pitt faculty. “It provides
us with research conditions for
faculty and graduate employment.
We will use this vehicle and make it
available to other institutions as
well." Freeman has already been

talking with Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity on some proposed projects.

The quick action of Pitt was a
major factor in its ability to aquire
the research center. Pitt's Founda-
tion for Applied Science and Tech-
nology was alerted to the declining
use of Harmarville by Henry A.
LaRue, the retired president of Gulf
Research and Development Com-
pany, which oversaw the operations
at Harmarville. LaRue proposed
that since Gulf was soon to be taken
over by Chevron, Pitt should look
into acquiring the center. LaRue is
now a senior staff consultant for
FAST. .

Richard K. Olson, president of
FAST, alerted Freeman, who then
contacted Gulf about the possible
donation of the research center to
Pitt.

Negotiations centered around
Pitt’s qualifications to handle the
center. Pitt is strongly recognized in
the fields of chemistry, surface
science, crystallography, medicine,
biology, pharmacology, physics and
electrical engineering, all of which
could prosper from the donation of
the center.

A major benefit of the donation
will be Pitt’s ability to give
researched information to the public
and private enterprise through an
incubator service.

The incubator service allows

small, newly-formed companies to
buy services easily and efficiently.
Harmarville offers 863,000 square
feet of space that can be rented to
companies for this purpose. These
companies can readily use informa-
tion that has been researched and
process it into their own products.

According to the press release,
Harmarville offers these companies
services not readily available in typi-

.cal office-type incubator facilities.

Among these are management, busi-
ness, marketing, production assist-
ance, computer, and technical and
lab services.

“This is what makes this oppor-
tunityunique: It is providing first-
class support services a small
company may require," Freeman
said.

Supplying these services has been
the driving force behind FAST.
Olson said that President Wesley
Posvar had wanted the university to
be more active in the area of technol-
ogy and had also wanted the univer-
sity to be more beneficial to the local
economy.

“There are a lot of groups existing
to market patents, but we wanted to
go beyond that. We’re finding
research needs of the private sector,
forming faculty teams and applying
them to research and solve those

Pitt basketball, football show
poor average QPA for fall

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

It was revealed in a Senate Coun-
cil meeting March 25 that Pitt bas-
ketball and football players
averaged the lowest qualitative
point averages among all l5 varsity
sports teams after the. end of last
term.

Dr. Toby Chapman, chairman of

_ the senate’s athletics subcommittee,

presented the annual report that
listed the average basketball QPA at
1.77 and average football QPA at
2.05. The women's volleyball team
earned highest honors with an aver-
age of 3.08. Other teams fluctuated
between 2.30 and 2.76.

Chapman, an associate chemistry
professor in his first year as chair-
man, said the senate was pleased
with the overall results but
expressed concern over the two
revenue-producing programs.

“As far as football is concerned,
there is a problem,” Chapman said.
“Support Services said part of the
problems with academics last year
was poor performances. That affects

everything. But we're talking about
a one-shot thing. There's been a sud-
den drop-off. We don’t know how
bad the problem is, but with basket-
ball, that’s a problem."

Since the university evaluates stu-

" dent athletes annually, it is not

known yet which basketball players,
if any, might be placed on proba-
tion. .Both CAS and CGS, in which a
majority of the players are enrolled,
require a 2.0 minimum, with the
respective deans ultimately deciding
probation and possible redshirting.

The football team's QPA marks a
three-year low as it steadily
increased from the fall l98l~mark of
1.89. Ever since then, average QPAs
of 2.21 and 2.28 have been achieved.
The basketball team suffered a sim-
ilarly extensive drop-off from 1982
and 1983 marks of 2.13 and 2.17,
respectively.

Chapman. and Paul Yuna, a coun-
selor with Support Services, both
attribute the declines to new, more
rigid academic requirements that
were implemented in the fall of 1983.
Also cited were travel impositions,
last year's poor record (3-7-l) and
what Yuna said is a noted shift
toward more technically oriented
courses.

Yuna estimated that over 75iper-

cent of football and basketball play-
ers are CAS students. Current and
entering CAS students must satisfy
writing, mathematics, foreign lan-
guage and general education
requirements to maintain eligibility.
“I‘ve looked at it inside and out,"
Yuna said, “and the reason the
grades are poor is really because of
the gradual effects of curriculum
reform. We really monitor their
requirements, and our kids did rela-
tively well in these skills courses.
“Where we got hurt were in the
electives. And while I can’t quantify
it, the planning process of the uni-
versity has had a significant effect on
the_ faculty. The words ‘quality edu-
cation‘ aren't just words. The aca-
demic administration has been
putting emphasis on it. It starts with
the faculty members. This [fall]
term, the evaluation of courses
reﬂected that. Teachers are taking
this seriously and that’s good, and
[as a result], our kids did poorly.”
Before the new requirements
arrived, Yuna added that the level of
teaching was not subpar, but there
has since been “more emphasis on
quality education. I wouldn't say
[professors] were lax, though.”

President Wesley Posvar, Vice
President Jack Freeman and Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin spent the bet-
ter part of the afternoon yesterday
quieting fears of the university staff
concerning the Five-year Plan.

The meeting, sponsored by the
Pitt Staff Association Assembly,
was held to discuss the university
plan and how it will affect both the
faculty and staff members.

“I would be surprised if there’s

someone in this room who would be
so adversely affected,” Posvar said
in relation to staff dismissals.
Posvar said the administration is
planning to give added emphasis to
staff training and development in
the future. He mentioned four dif-
ferent areas of staff development,

including employee recognition,job
mobility, performance appraisal
and participation teams.

Participation teams, according to
Posvar, would be “forums in a given
area for employees to get together
and talk about their ideas and prob-
lems." Posvar mentioned that these
teams have been successful in the
corporate world. “I think it will be
useful to us and a lot offun," Posvar
said.

A question directed to Posvar
from someone in the audience dealt
with the coverage of The Post-
Gazette on the Five-year Plan that
went through each department and
rated it as a “winner” or “loser”
according to the plan. Posvar was
asked if he thought these media rat-
ings would have an adverse effect on
recruiting and federal grants.

Posvar called the reports “very
unfair, misleading and unfortu-
nate.” He said that the Five-year
Plan is “talking about size and size

only" — not academic rating. Pos-
var added that no people in
Washington ever read the Pitts-
burgh paper, and concluded that
there would be no adverse effect on
federal grants.

“I think that the reputations of
individual departments are not
made by the newspapers, but by
scholarly reports,” Posvar said.

The university has two channels
for staff-administration communi-
cation, the Staff Association Coun-
cil and the Office of Human
Resources. Posvar said that the
administration “really believes in
this kind of communication
process.”

When asked if the Office of
Human Resources would have the
resources to effectively do thejob of
evaluating staff, Freeman said, “We
have given a very high priority to
improvements in human resources.
We are strengthening that office.”

‘Casablanca’ au

By Bryan Lee W
The Pitt News

Few films have managed to cap-
ture the kind of fanatical following
that “Casablanca" has. Maybe it’s
because of Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman, or it could be
because of the exotic setting and the
trappings of war. Whatever the rea-
son, it’s a mystery to Julius Epstein,
the 75-year-old author of the film’s
screenplay.

“It's not one of my favorite

~ movies," said Epstein, following Fri-

day night’s special screening of the
film at the University of Pittsburgh
Writers‘ Conference. “We knew we
were shooting corn,” he said. “This
picture has more com in it than the
entire state of Iowa.”

Epstein made -it clear he doesn't
take a great deal of pride in the film.
It was not a successful movie, he
said; it never grossed more than $3
million. He claimed Friday night
was the first time he watched the
movie since it premiered 40 years
ago.

functioned and caused the picture to
flutter for a few minutes.

“I was so happy when the picture
went blurry," Epstein said. “I hoped
it would stay that way for the rest of
the reel."

He saves his worst criticisms for
his own screenplay. The screenplay
wasn’t written, he said; it was con-
cocted. There were no such things as
exit visas and no Germans ever wore
uniforms in Casablanca.

Epstein does take pride in some of
his more recent efforts, such as
“Reuben, Reuben” and “Pete and
Tillie," which he says are his two
favorite works. Other films he’s writ-
ten include “The Man Who Came to
Dinner” and “Arsenic and Old
Lace.”

The movie industry has changed
considerably in the many years since
Epstein got his start in it. He

"wouldn't pinpoint the exact year,

but he said it was “two to three years
after sound came in.” He said the
studios were in a turmoil because of
the introduction of sound, and hir-
ing anyone who could write.

The movie studios have perhaps
changed the most in the roughly 50
years since Epstein first went to Hol-
lywood. At that time, the studios

were tremendously powerful in the
dictatorial command of movie mog-
uls such as Louie B. Mayer and
Daryl Zanuck. He said the moguls
were for the most part uneducated
and illiterate, “but they had a great
flair for show business.

“Today, all you have to do is write
a story about a high school boy try-
ing to lose his virginity," Epstein
said, “and if he‘s on another planet,
all the better."

Despite the many changes,
Epstein says he is still an avid movie-
goer, but the movie has to be on a big
screen — he never watches a movie
on television.

“Small screens were made for
shutters," he quipped.

Another reason he hates to see
movies on television is the commer-
cials. He said commercials were
probably why he hadn’t watched
“Casablanca” in so many years.

Despite his disparaging com-
ments, Epstein shed quite a bit of
light on the making of
“Casablanca.”

All 125 writers at Warner Broth-
ers Studios were at one time busy
writing different endings for the
film. Epstein himself wrote some 50
different endings to “Casablanca.”

is his own worst critic

The studio finally decided to go with
the original ending, with one line of
dialogue deleted.

The movie ends with Humphrey
Bogart and Claude Raines walking
off into the wet, foggy night after
safely seeing Bergman and her
screen husband safely off on a plane
to Lisbon. Bogart has just killed a
Nazi officer, and as the Vichy sol-
diers swarm onto the scene, Raines
tells the soldiers to “round up the
usual suspects," saving Bogart from
prison. '

After agreeing to join the resis-
tance, Bogart turns to Raines and
says, “I think this is going to be the
beginning of a beautiful relation-
ship.” The end, roll credits.

The way Epstein originally wrote
the ending, it was Raines who said,
“I think this is going to be the begin-
ning of a beautiful relationship.”

To which Bogart was to reply,
“Yes, but don’t forget, you still owe
me I0,000 francs.”

When asked whether or not the
ending as he first wrote it was better,
Epstein shrugged his shoulders and
_said, “We’ll never know.”

After he finished his prepared
remarks, Epstein said to the several
hundred in the audience, “Now, if

page 23

you have any questions, I'll be happy
to evade them.”

His answers to several questions
elicited laughter. When one person
suggested the ending of “Casablan-
ca" seemed perfect for a sequel to the
film, he exclaimed, “God forbid!”

“Bogart was known to be difficult,
and with a few drinks even worse,"
Epstein said. “But we had no trouble
at all with him — remarkably. At
that time, Bogart was not a big star,”
said Epstein.

“An even lesser star, who did a
screen test for ‘Casablanca,’ was
Ronald Reagan, who’s still being
miscast."

But perhaps the most interesting
insight Epstein offered was “the rea-
son ‘Casablanca’ was made was
because of a Pittsburgh girl.” He
credited Irene Lee, a displaced Pitts-
burgher working for Warner Broth-
ers, with acquiring the rights to an
obscure stageplay called “Every-
body comes to Rick’s.” According to
Epstein even the stageplay was “one
ear of corn after another.”

Epstein said resignedly, “Irene

I bought it, we made it, the rest is
misery.”

Harrnarville

The University of Pittsburgh realized a tremendous
coup yesterday with the acquisition of the Gulf Research

Center in Harmarville.

The university is indeed very fortunate to be given a
ready-made research center with state-of-the-art equip-
ment and buildings valued at $100 million.

In addition, the Chevron Corporation contributed $3
million to the venture, and the state is being asked for an

additional $3 million.

The research center is to be named the Pittsburgh
University Research Center Corporation. The center's
new president, Henry LaRue, is touting the center as a
breeding ground for new business in the surrounding

area.

“You could make a scenario that Harmarville might be
the catalyst by which a high-tech valley might be devel-
oped,” LaRue was quoted in The Pittsburgh Press.

That would be a terrific development in an area still
smarting from the collapse of the steel industry, and small
recompense for the loss of the Gulf Corporation, one of
Pittsburgh’s corporate giants, to Chevron. -

The schools of medicine and sciences are certainly ver
excited over the opportunities the center will offer to Pitt
researchers. Only time will tell what important develop-

ments may arise.

The administration is to be commended for its fore-
sight in successfully pursuing the acquisition of the cen-
ter. Chevron and Gulf are now able to realize a whopping
tax write-off, and Pitt receives an industrial-quality

research CCIIIZCT at no COSC.

But as Pitt gets into the business of business-building, P
let us hope that the administration does not lose sight of
its original purpose — education.

The administration is admittedly emphasizing research
over education. The furor over the F ive-year Plan recom-
mendations was centered around the university’s empha-
sis of research over education.

Research is not possible if the researcher is not edu-
cated. As the university emphasizes research more and
more in the future, let us hope that research continues to
be an outgrowth of the educational process.

Somewhat Ironic

Since the beginning of the term,
the students at the University of
Pittsburgh have read a great deal
about the impending student aid
cuts proposed by the Reagan admin-
istration. Just recently, the Student
Government Board has begun a
campaign to alert students as well as
their congressmen about the disas-
trous effects this would have on
those who need financial aid to con-
tinue to go to school.

While I commend the SGB on
taking a stand onga specific issue
along with taking positive steps to
rectify the situation. I do find it
somewhat ironic that the very peo-
ple the SGB is fighting with are the
same people they voted for last
November. Luke Kluchko even has
a picture of Ronald Reagan, the very
man who proposed the cuts, hanging
in his office!

It distresses me that members of
the SGB, as well as many students,
did not check on Mr. Reagan’s stand
on the issue of student aid before they
went into the voting booth. If they
had, they would have seen that the
president has consistently called for
cuts in financial aid to students.

In the future, I think it would be
wise if the students take the time to
research a proposal before they vote
for or demonstrate against it. Again,
I applaud the SGB’s letter-writing
campaign and heartily encourage all
students to write their congressmen
and express their dismay with the
president's plan.

Closed eyes

I am writing this article in the
hope that whoever decides what is
worthy of a holiday at Pitt reads
this. So, Good Friday is not worthy
ofa day off at the university? Maybe
the people who decide what holidays

are good enough to close school '

don't believe in honoring the death

the E ditQl‘  

of Jesus, but a lot of students,
including myself, do.

The same people who decide to
ignore this special day should be
ashamed of themsleves. They will
close the school in remembrance of
Martin Luther King, but when it
comes to Jesus, they close their eyes.
King was a great man, and I truly
admire all that he did to better the
lives of many in the United States.

But I am willing to bet that King
would rather have a day off to think
about the seriousness of Jesus
Christ’s death than to think about
himself. King would have put him-
self aside to make room for the
Lord, but it seems that the university
is above this.

Here I have a legitimate gripe and
I am not even mentioning that this
holiday also falls on Passover. The
Jews were finally led out of bondage
but I guess the university isn’t
respecting their religion either.

So, instead of going to temple or a
service, we will sit in classrooms to
be filled with worldly knowledge.
People may think: What is the big
deal? These same people who

wonder what the big deal is are pro b-
ably the first to cry to God as soon as
there are any burdens in their life.
Everybody today is too busy asking,
asking, asking and they never con-
sider thanking the Lord.

I am not saying that I am better
than everybody else, but at least I am
standing up for what I believe in. I
realize what a serious and somber
day this is and am willing to forget
about myself, lower my head and say
“thanks."

Oh, I am not the only one who
seems to think that Good Friday is
worthy ofa holiday — it is a national
holiday. The banks will be closed, no
trials will take place, no mail will be
coming to my box and many stores
will close their doors, even if only for
a few hours. And at the same time,
Pitt will stay open, send us around to
class, administer tests and act like
nothing special happened to the
Christians or Jews so many years
ago.

Horror story

I am totally fed up with every
office here at the University of Pitts-
burgh. I can never step out my door
with the intention to go to one office
and do onejob. It‘s not like this has
been happening year after year, and
I'm ﬁnally spilling my guts. l’mjust a
freshman. This whole saga started
before I even came to Pitt.

In the summer, I received an SAR
to fill out to be processed in order to
receive aid and get a loan. I filled out
the form and sent it in. A couple
weeks later, I got a letter telling me I
better fill out the enclosed SAR ifl
wish to receive aid — my second
SAR!

A few weeks after this, my bill
came. Well, I figured my loan would
come through in a matter of days,
and I could pay the bill. I waited and

’ waited —— no loan.

Finally, I decided to call the bank.
They told me that they have no
record of me even applying for a
loan, and that I had better call Pitt.

' Feeling a little frustrated, I went
to the Office of Student Aid. They
tell me to fill out this SAR. I really
didn’t mind — that had been easy
enough —— but it had been my third
SAR. They assured me that my loan
would be processed, patted me on
the head and sent me downstairs to
get a deferral slip.

In the fall, I was awarded a schol-
arship. I received my loan and
thought, “Oh no, not again -
another confusing matter for Pitt.“
My scholarship letter said to wait for
an “aid award.” Well, my deferral
was about to expire, my loan was in,
but I didn’t have the aid award letter.
What should I do?
~ I called student aid. They said
they didn’t know what to do -— call
the registrar’s office. I faithfully did
so, and they told me to wait for my
award letter for aid and bring every-
thing in together.

OK, that was easy enough. A few
weeks later, I got a little notice tell-
ing me I better pay my bill soon and
the rest of that whole story. So I
came to the registrar's office to pay
my bill — mind you, this is the same
office telling me to wait. I got my fall
term sticker and my I. D. (needless to
say, I couldn't go to any football
games or use any of the resources I
was entitled to and paying for,
because it was “just Pitt’s system,"
according to the woman who
refused to give me a temporary
I.D.), which was about to expire in
two weeks anyway.

But that was OK, the whole ordeal
was over.

This term was the worst. Idecided
to move into the dorms. At home I
worked, and I needed a job while I
was down here, too. First, I called
the work study office to see if I was
eligible to receive it this term. The
woman I talked to gave me a specific
date to come in and speak to a coun-
selor. When I got there, one of the
ladies took my name and pulled my
folder. She said I was not eligible. I
explained that I moved down here
this term, and my bill would be dif-
ferent. I then asked to see a counsel-
or. She told me that she was sorry,
but I wasn’t eligible before and I
won’t be now. I thought ofthis for a
couple ofdays and made an appoint-
ment with a counselor myself. When
I met with a counselor, he stated that
it was clear I was eligible for work
study. Someone goofed. Again, this
verdict came from the same office.

Should I dare to go further? I reg-
istered for spring session on Feb. 27.
taking four credits. After a few
weeks, I decided to take one credit.
So I walked over to the cathedral to
pick up an add/drop form. The lady
at the desk told me she can't give out
any forms until April IS, the first
day of add/drop. Well, this was
cute, since my bill was due April 2. I
explained to the woman that I
needed a form before April 2. She
told me that this was not possible; I
had to get a deferral.

When I got to Bruce Hall to pick
up my deferral, they told me to go to
the registrar‘s office and ask to be
put on a deferred payment plan. At
Thackeray. the woman told (me that

'21»

they couldn’t do anything without
an add/ drop form. So she called and
informed them that I needed an
add drop form no matter what. I
walked back to the cathedral -
where I started from w to pick up
my form and went home. There was
no way I was going to continue this
ordeal ~ at least not that day.

I think it‘s high time Pitt brings in
an efficiency team to redo the whole
system. Each office should know
their job. But as my roommate
stated, “No, that‘s too easy."

I‘m tired of going through the
royal runaround every time some-
thing needs to be done. When I call. I
get the same results as if I’m there in
person — no answers,just a mess of
confusion. It’s useless to mail any-
thing because some office some-
where will lose it anyway.

Where's the end of the rainbow?
After all, we’re the ones supplying
the gold.

Commendable

I would like to compliment The
Pitt News for a commendablejob on
“sports briefs," “famous quotes,"
etc.

However, the list of all-time best
sports movies (March 20) is incom-
plete. “Raging Bull,” the classic
Robert DeNiro film about boxer
Jake LaMotta should have been

, included. Also, let‘s not forget the

I982 Academy Award winner for
best film,'“Chariots of Fire.”

SUMMER SUBLETS

The Pitt News, Wednesday, April 3, 1985

page 5

Several things about this time
of year get on my nerves. Proba-
bly the thing that irritates me the
most is that I have entirely too
much to do. All those things that
I‘ve been putting off for the past
three months are piling up and
demanding that Icomplete them.
The horrors of the ﬁnal exam
period are becoming truer than
life itself.

Take for instance the compli-
cations of reading all of “The
Canterbury Tales” at once. Now,
“The Canterbury Tales" are a
wonderful thing, and Chaucer
deserves a big slap on the back
for writing them. The only gripe I
have is that they are entirely too
long. What student this time of
year wants to sit down and read
the whole thing? Oh sure, Icould
have kept up with the progress of
the class and been in rosy shape
right now.

But geez, think of what the stu-
dent of today has to deal with.
Only a few days ago there was the
NCAA basketball finals. No col-
lege student in his right mind
would want to miss that. How

can anyone blame me for skip-
ping out on my Chaucer?
Another thing I’ve discovered
I can’t do without is at least two
hours of the campus radio sta-
tion. When I first arrived at this
place and found that we were on
the FM band, I was excited.
Then people told me how horri-
ble the station was. I was mildly
disappointed and avoided 98.5
for fear I’d be listening to an
“uncool” radio station.

Well, eventually you have to
run across that frequency
because it’s right between
WRCT and WYDD. One day,as
I was spinning the dial from one
to the other, the phone rang.
Through some force that may
well have been divine, the dial
landed on 98.5 just before I
pulled my hand away to go
answer the phone.

When I came back from the
phone, I’d forgotten about the
whole business with the radio,
and proceeded to read. I forget
what I was reading, it may well
have been Chaucer. At any rate,
the stuff that was coming out of

Sunshine in the Shade/Dirk Kaufman

Something to soothe the pre-finals frazzles

the radio was perfect. It was
good, original quality music. I
was able to listen to it and study
at the same time. So I unwit-
tingly left the dial there.

A few hours later I looked up
from the books long enough to
hear the DJ say that the station
was WPTS. Could it really be
that Pitt's radio station was play-
ing a nicer mix of music than my
beloved WRCT and WYDD
combined?

Actually, no. But the fact is
that WPTS was playing some
good music. They took me away
from some old standby stations
and thereby won half the battle.
The music that each of these sta-
tions plays is aimed at college-
type people like myself. I have
found that WPTS lands some-
where between the WRCT and
WYDD, and I like the stuff
they’re playing.

The thingthat pulls me away
from the Pitt station is in some
cases the DJ, and in others, some
of the horrible promotional stuff
they do.

There is a particular plug that
they use to promote one of the

DJs. It is a play on the name
Daniels and it's common identity
with Charlie, Jack, and whoever
the DJ is. I can’t tell you who
they are promoting because I
change the station as soon as the
promo piece comes on. It nau-
seates me.

Most of the other things that
irritate me will change when the
DJs get more experience. Once
they are a little more comfortable
with what they say, the station
will be fine for my constant
attention.

The thing to remember is that
it is a truly good station. The
natural urge for all of us as stu-
dents is to criticize. We all think
that we could be doing a better
job. In this case, I must say that
those in charge ofthe station are
doing as good ajob as anyone on
campus could do.

So, if you’re sitting in your
room trying to think of ways to
avoid studying, flip on the radio
and tune in to 98.5. I wouldn’t
say that you'll fall into a trance
and listen to the station non-
stop. But you might wellenjoy it.

Dear Pittsburghers,

We believe that when students feel strongly, they
respond. In the past, Pittsburgh politics has not brought
about that reaction. Now, a young alumnus is running for
City Council; his name is Mark Pollock.

He wants each graduate to have the opportunity to
remain in Pittsburgh. He has researched a way of creating a
tremendous amount of new positions in this city by pro-
moting Pittsburgh-made products. “No one should have a
cracker on their shelves that isn’t made by Nabisco,” says
Pollock. “And that’s just the beginning. Most of us aren’t
even aware of many ofthe products that are manufactured
here. With the support of all local industry, we create a
need for more employees. Our country is doing it. Why not
Pittsburgh?” ,

Mark Pollock will be your voice on City Council if you
help put him there. A

He needs each of us to register before April 20th.

We must be registered as Democrats in order to vote for
him. ’

In the past only) 4% of the Student Body voted.

He needs every student to participate in this primary.

If you feel strongly, you will want to help him win.

Thank you,
His brothers, Lee, Adam, and Herky Pollock

Olson also said that current

as a new sterilant for medical instru- no one

was toxic and believed to be
carcinogenic. ’ RESEARCH FACILITY

Another project is developing a
new form of stuttering therapy that
has been shown to cure stuttering in
some of the patients who have used
It.

FAST also applies its abilities to
finding donators for Pitt. Olson said
that the group has already been able
to get $1 million from the Ben
Franklin Partnership for faculty
groups.

T. Robert Rudolf, senior market
consultant to FAST and the new
executive vice-president ofthe Pitts-
burgh University Research Center,
said there were no companies con-
tracted into the research facility yet,
but several had shown interest in the
center.

“We have no definite contracts.
We haven’t legally transferred the
center yet; it may be until January
I986 until that occurs. What we do
have is an interim agreement that
will allow us to move in. That agree-
ment is going between the two legal
departments right now, but we don’t
anticipate any problems,” Rudolf
said.

The_research center, founded in we can am...
1933, has had a long history in the
development of petroleum by-
products. Harmarville was a major
component in the fabrication of syn-
thetic fuels and varieties of plastics.

John Hamilton, spokesman for
Chevron, said this action was a gen-
erous donation on the part of the
company and shows the corpora-
tion’s philanthropy.

teams’ low standing ‘resultant of
“individual differences. We’re look-
ing atone semester, and there’s been
a drop-off in decimal fractions,”
Bozil-: said. “How do you explain it?
Different people.”

Another factor, Yuna noted,
includes basketball and football
players moving toward technically
oriented courses like information
sciences, computer science and math
above the algebra level.

His comparison model is fall
l982, a term that he said did not
indicate as many student athletes in
the technical field as today.

“Our kids are much like regular
kids looking for a technical degree,”
Yuna continued. “They’re taking
cracks at more technical degrees
because they want something more
down the road.”

In an informal survey conducted
by The Pitt News, the athletes of
several Division 1 programs similar
to the Panthers’ all have higher
QPAs.

Of the five schools polled (offer-
ing results through last fall), the
UCLA Bruins averaged a 2.55 while
Florida State fluctuated between 2.1
and 2.4. Others included Missouri,
Texas A&M (both 2.24) and Virgi-
nia (2.29).

Another school, Nebraska, last
spring averaged the QPA (2.85) 3f
the 60 football players who travel.
But according to the Cornhuskers’
academic advisor Dr. Ursula R.
Walsh, her office ordinarily never
compiles a team-by-team break-
down of all 18 varsity sports in
Lincoln.

“I have never done it,” she said,
“find[ing] it hard to believe it com-
pares” with Nebraska’s overall 3.0
average.

Of the five schools, all their bas-
ketball teams fared decisively better
than Pitt’s. From FSU (2.0-2.5) to
UCLA (2.5), none came close to
matching the Pitts l.77. ’_

In the wake of the basketball
team‘s latest showing, another aca-
demic advisor has been hired to sup-
plement the three current Support
Services counselors.

dinate activities between students
and Support Services and try to

coordinate‘ the student’s schedules '

with faculty teaching the courses,”
said Chapman, whose committee
recommended the additional hiring.

“Some athletes are reticent in
talking to professors regarding
travel, homework and so forth.”

Nearly 95 percent of all basketball
and football players are CAS or
CGS students (according to Yuna),
abiding, like other students, by a
myriad of requirements in their
respective schools. Each must main-
tain a 2.0 QPA. If CAS student-
athletes do not attain that by the end
oftheir sophomore year, Dean Irwin
Schulman can recommend aca-
demic suspension or probation.

CGS Dean John Bolvin, who's
also Pitt’s NCAA faculty represen-
tative, can impose similar restric-
tions after a student has encountered
at least 18 credits.

Chapman, in his committee’s
report, also mentioned the most
recent graduation rates for football.
Of the 23 recruited in 1979, l2 grad-
uated with a variety of degrees. One
is still taking courses today, three
other players finished their eligibil-
ity but did not graduate, four with-
drew from Pitt and three
transferred.

He prided himself on having a complete collection of
Pitt T-shirts. He was very popular. He hit all the parties
and entertained everyone by tossing his cookies and
then lying on his back in the john and crying. When
he ﬁnally made it back to the room at 4:00 a.m., he
needed to crank Led Zeppelin’s fourth up to full
volume to relax himself. He always went to sleep
listening to Black Dog. He said it reminded him of his
mom.

You were his best friend. How could you forget him?

For The Pitt News

It seems that Chris Jelicjust can’t
get away from calling signals no
matter what sport he is playing.

During the fall months, Jelic is a
quarterback- for the University of
Pittsburgh football team. Now that
spring has rolled around, Jelic is
calling the signals from behind the
plate for the pitchers on the Pitt
baseball team.

“Being a catcher is a lot like being
a quarterback," said Jelic, a junior
from Mt. Lebanon. “You help the
guys out a lot. Everything starts at
the plate. I like playing there. You
have to be a leader, and I think I
have the personality for that.”

Last season, Jelic started in the
outfield for the Panthers and pro-
vided some relief pitching. He fin-
ished with a .266 batting average,
leading the team in triples with four
and striking out only two times in 64
at bats.

Jelic got his first experience at
catcher this summer when he played
for the Hyannis Mets in the Cape
Cod League. He caught in IS games
and also played the outfield and pro-
vided some relief pitching. His .331
batting average was ninth in the
league out of approximately 280
players. He produced 42 hits with 28
RBIs and was fourth in the league
with nine home runs.

This season, all of Jelic‘s playing
time has been behind the plate, and
that is just where he belongs. While
he has a .350 batting average with
onehome run and five RBIs, it is his
defensive play that is really out-
standing,. according to Pitt coach
Bobby Lewis. '

“Chris has an,excellent arm,” said
Lewis. “It was amazing how quickly
he picked up playing catcher. He

givég yea the impféssioﬁ that he was

The Dapper Dan Roundball Clas-
sic showcases the top high school
basketball talent in the nation annu-
ally. And last night left no one disap-
pointed, including Pitt basketball
fans. The reason? A pair of Pitt
recruits, 6-9 Steve Maslek and 6-6
Jerome Lane, had excellent

 performances.

Lane, a guard-forward from
Akron, Ohio, scored 15 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds as he led the
United States All-Stars to victory. “I
feel I did all right, but I could have
done a lot better,” said Lane. Many
of the 11,000 fans may have ques-
tioned that last comment as Lane’s
all-around play was very impressive.
Not many Pittsburgh basketball
fans are used to watching someone

end wrap-up.

Lllana Kohutiak received yet another honor
at the Pitt women's volleyball tea_m’s year-

back there his whole career.”
Jelic’s decision to switch to
catcher came mainly out of his aspi-
ration — which may soon come true
-— to play professional baseball.
“The scouts feel that I am better
suited to be a catcher," Jelic said.
“Because of my strong arm and
quick release, they feel it is the posi-
tion for me. I have been hearing pos-
itive things from them. Ithink I have
a good chance at being drafted.”
While Jelic is out on the diamond
displaying his talents, his Panther

who is 6-6 handle the ball as adeptly
as Lane did a last night.

Lane will be a definite candidate
for a starting position on Roy Chip-
man’s Pitt Panther squad next year.
Along with his ability to handle the
ball, he is a skilled rebounder, last
night pulling down a quiet 10
rebounds. Lane expects to contrib-
ute immediately to the Panther
attack. “It all depends where they
need me. I’ll play point guard,
second guard or small forward.”
Lane did admit that he prefers
second guard.

As for Maslek, time will tell. Per-
haps not totally developed as a bas-
ketball player, Maslek will most
likely not have the same impact on
the Pitt program Lane will, but he
will contribute eventually. Despite
his performance, Maslek was not all
that satisfied. “I feel I did OK,”said
Masklek. “I wish I could have
played a little bit more,” having only
played 21 minutes.

football teammates are involved in
spring practice. Although missing
practices may set him back, it also
helps him in some ways.

“It can be monotonous playing
football all year,” he said. “You get
drained. Baseball is relaxing for me.
It is something new. I have been
playing both sports all my life, and I
didn’t see any reason for giving
either of them up. During football
season, I have to miss fall baseball,
so that‘s a setback, too. It’s just
something I have to deal with."

Classic

Following the graduation of
Keith Armstrong, who will graduate
next year, Chipman will be in the
market for a center, and that fact is
what Maslek is counting on. “I see
myself as maybe filling a need for a
center in one or two years," said
Maslek.

No matter where they play, both
players were glad to be in Pitts-
burgh. “It was a nice experience,"
said Lane. “I'm happy to be here.”
Maslek agreed: “It was a great expe-
rience for me.”

Pitt basketball fans hope there
will be many other great performan-
ces from these two in the next four
years.

Lohman produces
at bat, in outﬁeld p

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Opening night jitters were nonex-
istent for University of Pittsburgh
baseball player Brian Lohman.

When the freshman , from Mt.
Lebanon took the ﬁeld at Florida
State in his first game as a Panther,
he played as calm and cool as a sea-
soned veteran.

Lohman got the start in center-
field in the Panthers’ second game
against the Seminoles and then
again the next night in left field.

“I was more nervous the first
game when I was on the bench,” he
explained. “I knew I wouldn’t start
the first game, but I was just waiting
for my shot. I knew I could definitely
play. I was a little nervous before the
game I played, but onceit started, I
was OK.”

Lohman was more than OK. He
was relaxed at the plate, with two
singles in four at bats in his first
outing. He displayed his aggressive
style with some good defensive plays
in the outﬁeld.

“Brian is a natural athlete,” said

, Coach Bobby Lewis. “He is a good

baserunner. He is very fast. He is
outstanding defensively, and he has
a good bat. He is going to be a really
good ballplayer.”

Despite Lohman‘s efforts and
equally good ones by his teammates,
the nationally—ranked Seminoles
defeated Pitt in three straight games.

Lewis, Curtis Aiken, Marlon Fergu-
son and Darryl Shepherd  This
must be Rollie Massimino‘s week.
After winning the national cham-
pionship on Monday night, Villa-
nova had its star recruit, Doug West
of Altoona, named MVP of the
Pennsylvania All-Stars  Rodney

Whereas it was the season-opening
series for the Panthers, Florida State
had already played over 30 games.

“Player for player, we were as
good as them,” Lohman said. “I felt
that we could definitely play with
these guys.”

The Panthers are now preparing
for their first Big East season, and
Lohman is planning on playing a
role in the team’s efforts.

“I would really like to be named
Big East Freshman of the Week,” he
said. “I also want the team to finish
in the top two in the Big East.”

When not playing baseball, Loh-
man is on the football field, where he
is a walk—on punter for the Panthers.

At Mt. Lebanon High School,
Lohman was a two-year letterman in
both baseball and football. In base-
ball, he was named All-WPIAL and
All-Conference. In football, he was
a member of the Pittsburgh Press
South Fabulous 22, the Almanac
All-Stars and was named All-
Conference. In addition, he was the
recipient of the Robert M. Kahn
Award which is presented to an ath-
lete who is unselfish and represents
team spirit. ’

Lohman comes from a family of
II children, all of whom are inter-
ested and involved in sports.

“The Lohman name is a well-
known one in Mt. Lebanon,” Lewis
said. “There have been a lot of them
playing sports at Mt. Lebanon High
SchooL _

“What impressed me the most
about Brian was his enthusiasm. He
really loves to play.”

Strickland of Oak Hill McAdam
was named MVP of the United
States All-Star team. Strickland will
attend DePaul  Lane, an outstand-
ing baseball player who is I8-3 the
last two seasons as a pitcher, indi-
cated his baseball career is over after
this season even if he is drafted.

Spikers wrap up season

By Laurie Kubli
TheP%tHews

The Pitt women's volleyball team,
which finished the season at 30-8 by
losing in the first round of the
NCAA playoffs after winning the
Big East championship, recently
held its annual wrap—up banquet.
Coach Shelton Collier presented
several awards to his players, includ-
ing the MVP honor bestowed upon
All-America Ulana Kohutiak for the
second consecutive year.

The dinner was sponsored by Pitt
Golden Panther George Sliman and
held at the South Side’s Margarita-
ville. Kohutiak recently garnered the
East Suburban Chapter of the
Golden Panthers’ Senior Woman
Athlete of the Year Award in addi-
tion to the Big East MVP honor for
her part in the team’s accomplish-
ments. Among those include record-
ing 40 kills in a single match (against
Missouri), which was not only a
school record but also ranked first in
the NCAA for the entire season.

“Ulana’s was the best perfor-
mance of any player in the history of

Pitt volleyball,” said Collier.

“It says a lot for her, beating out
two other very deserving athletes,
and for Pitt volleyball and for
women’s volleyball in general,"
commented co-senior Cathy Rupp.
The setter was referring to Olympian
swimmer Sue Heon and Pitt basket-
ball’s top scorer Jennifer Bruce.

“Ulana definitely earned it,” said
Sally Gillespie, a junior who was
selected by her teammates as the
Best Practice Player for the third
year in a row. Of her own award,
Gillespie said, “I get the most out of
practices because I may not play
much in a game. I really worked
hard on improving my mental atti-
tude, and I try to radiate that to the
other players."

“Sally’s gotten [the award] three
years in a row, and that’s pretty
amazing,” Kohutiak remarked.
“Freshmen usually come in and try
to beat you out.”

Collier credited Gillespie’s inten-
sity with improving the atmosphere
in the gymnasium.

Freshman Louise O’Shaughnessy
was voted the Most Improved
Player, and Rupp won Collier’s
Coach’s Award. “Cathy was given

the Coach’s Award because she very
well could have been our MVP, our
Best Practice Player and Most
Improved, in addition to the fact
that she was our only player to play
every minute of every game the
entire season,” Collier explained.
“There are a lot of reasons why we
were successful, and she was perhaps
the main one.”

“It’s a really nice recognition of
the effort I put in here at Pitt," Rupp
said. “And in transferring from a
small college [Ohio], I never knew if
I would make it here. I thought I
might be sitting on the bench three
years.”

The banquet also enabled the
team to review the season highlights:
the conference championship, a 3-0
win over seventh-ranked Penn
State, a 31-game winning streak,
coming in first at the LSU Classic
with freshman Krista Zeiner filling
in for the injured Kohutiak, and
having the highest grade-point aver-
age of any team on campus.

Kohutiak, Rupp and Pat Belcher
will be graduating, but Collier said
he has a “solid core" of returnees and
his “best recruiting class" since he
came to Pitt five years ago. Collier’s
career record at Pitt is I53-55.

“Ulana is performance was the best of any player in the history of Pitt volleyball. ”

Dear Danny,

’Scuse me if I write informally. It's
just that we used to be neighbors,
but we never met. You an’ me used
to live on opposite sides of the
Boulevard of the Allies on Dawson
Street.

But I only lived there seven or
eight months, whereas you grew up
there.

Y‘see, you an’ me go back a ways.
Or should I say, me and Mia Marino,
we go back a ways.

This is my first winter back in the
‘burgh in two years. I was workin’ in
Miami, takin’ a lot 0‘ guff for bein‘
from Pittsburgh. That’s why I take
in the “Rand
McNally Places Rated Almanac’s”
recent edition placing Pittsburgh as
the No. 1 place in the countryto live.

Those were the days, when Danny was here

football team was No. l in the coun-

sign with Dallas. That’s before he
changed how you say his name.

When I lived on Dawson Street,
you were throwin’ bullets for the
Panthers. You threw the ball so
damn hard only Julius Dawkins
could catch the thing.

And there I was, workin’in Miami
during your rookie year. It sure is
good to see a hometown boy make
good. Everybody down there was
talkin’ ’bout what a phenom that
Danny Marine is. Listen, even ifyou
did lose, this year’s Superbowl was
one of the best ever — two western
Pennsylvania quarterbacks goin’
head to head. Man, shades of
Johnny Unitas and Broadway Joe.

I just drove over the Swinburne
Street bridge on my way home from
Oakland. You know the bridge,
man, it’s right behind your house.
Y’know, they're gonna tear the SOB

ers are beatin’ up on people in dorm
rooms. Man, is Bozik bent out of
shape. Phil Musick is scratching his
head for story ideas when he should
go back to writing sports.

Anyway, don't sweat about losin’
the big one last January. You got
plenty of Superbowls to go yet. I
mean, nobody in Pittsburgh could

believe you went so low in the draft.
You should‘ve won the Heisman,
man. '

I got such a kick outa seein’ you
on nationwide TV wearin’a Pirates’
hat and sayin' “Where’s Bill
Hillgrove?”

But the sports in this town are
really screwed up. They got baseball
players comin’ to town an’ testifyin‘
about cocaine an’ stuff like ‘at. Man,
baseball ain't been the same since
they tore down Forbes Field.

You grew up near Forbes Field. I
feel like I grew up goin’ there. My
dad used to get tickets ev’ry week-
end. I wish I had a nickel for ev’ry
time I seen Roberto Clemente slam
himself into the ivy out in right field,
come down with the ball in a
crumpled heap on the warning
track, pick himself up, throw the ball
to home plate on one or two hops an’
pick off the guy tryin’ to score from
third.

Phew! Now that was baseball.

I’m willin’ to bet money you was
one of the kids I used to see climbed
up into them trees the other side of
the outfield wall, scopin’ out the

M: "‘«'¢:5:;'o'e+-.11;-e *"‘ ”

game for free.

Now they're talkin’ ’bout sellin’
the Pirates. They’re even talkin’
’bout losin’ the franchise to some
Sun Belt city. If you ask me, it’s all a
plot to get more people out to see the
games in that concrete monstrosity
on the North Side.

But I don’t care. I ain't been much
of a baseball fan since the second
strike. The first one was bad enough.
I mean, baseball players on strike?
Gimme a break. An’ then they go out
a second time. Well, screw them,
man. Baseball’s supposed to be a
game, not a business.

Hey Danny, do me a favor, man.
Don't never go out on strike, OK’?

' Like I said, the sports are real
messed up around here. Some Pitt
football player rearranged some-
body's face with a crutch. Just like
wham, y’know? How’s come he did
that? What do they feed them guys at
the training table, raw meat?

Well, you be cool. Enjoy Miami,
but stay away from them coke deal-
ers. I know what they‘re like — I
watch “Miami Vice."

ThePitt News, Wednesday, April 3, I985

These are a few of my

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

If you are male and live in this
country, odds are that you have had,
at one time or another, a sports hero.

I hope you will excuse me for this,
but I would like to pay tribute to the
six athletes who have made my life
more enjoyable. Beware, some of
them are not popular with everyone.

First, there was Manny San-
guillen. He is the only one of my
heroes whom I have had the pleasure
of meeting. Indeed, it was an honor.

I liked him at first because he
seemed to be the only person in the
world who enjoyed baseball as much
as I did. He was always smiling.

During his time, he was the best
catcher in baseball. Say what you
will about Johnny Bench; Lou
Brock and I felt otherwise. The
legendary base stealer once said that
Sanguillen was the only catcher that
he ever faced against whom he was
hesitant to steal. He had an arm like
a cannon.

He was just as successful at the
plate. He put together a nice string
of .300 plus seasons. He used the
longest bats in the major leagues to
do so. I measured them at 37 inches.
I have three at home to prove it.

CONFESSIONS:

When I made my first Commun-
ion in the third grade, my parents
presented me with a pint-sized
Pirate uniform bearing the number
35. I spent the better part of the day
playing baseball in the back yard
showing off my new uniform.

For the next few years, I would
show it off to Sanguillen himself.
My parents would buy box seats to a
Pirate game, and we would go to the
stadium as soon as the gates opened.
I would go down to the rail and seek
out Sanguillen. He would always
come over and talk to his most
devoted fan. I

Eventually, he began to give me
free baseballs, a wristband, a hat and
the three bats, and once he had all of
the Pirates autograph a brand-new
baseball for me.

I’ll never forget his game-winning
hit in the second game of the 1979
World Series. Had it not been for
Sanguillen’s heroics, the Pirates
might have lost the Series in four
straight.

But the most memorable part of
that event was when, after the game
in the clubhouse, Sanguillen told the
TV audience that he had done it for
his late friend, Roberto Clemente. I
cried.

Roberto Clemente was another of
my heroes. I feel sorry for those who
never saw him play. lfyou didn’t you
probably can’t understand why he

Viewpoint

had such a vague nickname. But if
you were fortunate enough, like
myself, you understand that “The
Great One" is probably the most
appropriate nickname ever be-
stowed on an athlete.

There are three categories in
which Clemente reigned supreme.
He was one of the greatest competi-
tors in baseballhistory. Despite his
abundant God-given_ abilities, he
never was content to merely ride on
them. He never tried to rest on past
laurels. He was always striving to
improve.

Clemente also thrived on pres-
sure. It seemed like he never failed in
the clutch. This was evidenced by his
winning the MVP for the l97l
World Series. But, possibly, he was
best in the field. Although there are
many who I’ve never witnessed, Cle-
mente was, by far, the most gifted
defensive player that I have ever
seen.

My next two heroes were also the
best at what they did. But that’s not
the main reason that Terry Brad-

shaw and Kenny Stabler were my
heroes.

When he came to the Steelers,
Bradshaw was quoted as saying, 
and someday I hope to be the best
quarterback that’s ever set foot on
this field or any other field.” In the
opinion of many, he attained that
goal.

Despite this, he has remained a
humble and down-to-earth man in
the world of egotistical superstars
who haven’t achieved nearly as
much as he has.

He led the Steelers to an unprece-
dented four Super Bowl victories in
six years. He perhaps contributed
more to the wins than did any other
single player, yet he vehemently
denied it. Fame and success never
changed this humble country boy.

But it was because of his being a
blond-haired country boy that he
was dubbed a “dummy.” In reality,
he was successful due in part to his
intelligent play-calling.

When asked who he thought was
the best quarterback that he had
ever played against, Bradshaw re-
plied, “Kenny Stabler.”

I liked that. “The Snake” was my
hero for a couple of reasons.
Obviously, because he was good —
and a southpaw like myself. “Snake”
was the most poised athlete that I
have ever had the pleasure of watch-
ing. Because ofthis, he was the mas-

ter of the two-minute offense. He
was the king of comebacks. Brad-
shaw said that he never felt safe with
Stabler on the other sideline.

While these two were creating
excitement on the gridiron, Muham-
mad Ali was creating it everywhere
else. He had hype down to an art
form. He was just as entertaining
outside the ring as he was in it.

Inside the ring, he revolutionized
the sport of boxing. He proved that
finesse and speed could overcome
brute force. Most people remember
the Ali of the l970s, but the All of
the 1960s gets my vote as simply “the
greatest athlete of all time.” I apol-
ogize to any Sugar Ray Robinson,
Jim Brown or Babe Ruth fans. Ali
was truly “The Greatest.”

Then there is the man who wins
the award for taking the ability that
he had (and still has) and getting the
most out of it. Hate him if you will,
but Pete Rose is my No. I hero.

If you are one of those who hates
him, I know why. You won't admit
it, but it’s because he always seems to
beat your favorite team. What
makes it worse is that he enjoys it so
much.

He is the ultimate competitor. He
plays baseball the way it was played
around the turn of the century. He
has maintained that style of play
even into his 40s, when most surviv-
ing superstars start to take it easy.

This has sparked a recent increase
in the major leagues in “Pete Rose
type” players. But “Charlie Hustle"
remains the most entertaining player
for baseball purists.

I’ll never forget the I975 World
Series. It has been called by some the
most dramatic of all the Fall Clas-
sics. Rose was the MVP. He sparked
the winning rally in the seventh
game by performing an often-
overlooked but very important feat.
He sacrificed his body to break up a
double play that would’ve ended the
inning and the series—clinching rally.
This was vintage Rose.

Last year, when the Reds came to
town with their new player/man-
ager, I was there. It was a Sunday
afternoon, I was at a baseball game,
and it was about 75 degrees. A man
in his 40's hit a ball down the right
field line and dove headfirst into
second base. Thanks, Pete.

To all my heroes: Manny,
Roberto, Terry, Kenny, Muham-
mad and Pete, I would like to say,
“Thank you.”

We are a happy educated haPPllY

share our love with an infant. We can

The Pitt’ News, Wednesday, April 3,_ 1985

Results of the PIAA State championships

By Joe Hathaway and
Bob Travers
The Pitt News

Boys Class AAAA

Behind the scoring of All-
America guard Jeff Lebo, the Carli-
sle Thundering Herd defeated
Pittsburgh’s Brashear 74-64 Satur-
day night in Hershey to win the Boys
AAAA championship. Lebo led all
scorers with 26 points and 11
rebounds despite playing with a
broken finger on his shooting hand.

Brashear, the dark-horse team of
the championship, refused to fold
under Carlisle’s collapsing defense.
The Bullets, instead of trying to
move the ball inside Carlisle’s zone,
took most of their shots from the
perimeter, hitting just over 40 per-
cent from the floor.

in the end, it was the play of Lebo
and poor foul shooting that cost
Brashear the championship (the
Bullets were only 14 of 24 on foul
shot attempts), not to mention the
vehemently partisan crowd of 7,956.
(The city of Carlisle is just a few
miles up the road from Hershey.)

Trailing most of the game, Bra-
shear took a 50-48 lead late in the
third period, but in the fourth quar-
ter, it was all Lebo and Carlisle with
the Herd outscoring Brashear 22-12
in the final eight minutes of the
game.

Girls Class AAAA

Beaver Falls used a strong second
halfto come from behind and defeat
Plymouth-Whitemarsh 56-45 to win
the Girls Class AAAA finals.

The WPIAL champion Lady Tig-
ers were led by Joy Jeter and Angie
Kirkland, who scored 18 and 17
points, respectively. Whitemarsh
had a 28-26 lead at the half after
being up by as much as seven points
in the second period.

Beaver Falls outscored White-
marsh 16-9 in the third period to go
ahead 42-37 heading into the fourth
quarter.

Boys Class AAA

HERSHEY, Pa --— Erie Strong
Vincent (29-1), the District 10 cham-
pion, came to “Chocolate Town” on
Friday night. They hadn’t been there

for 53 years. and this absence made
the journey even sweeter.

Behind the dominating perfor-
mance of 6-6 center Anthony “Tree"
Dickens, Strong Vincent crushed
Nanticoke 70-53 to gain the PlAA
boys‘ Class AAA championship
before a crowd of 7,427 at Hershey
Park Arena.

Nanticoke (27-4). the District 2
champion, took a 6-3 lead in the first
quarter, but made a mistake by try-
ing to play a fastbreak game against
Vincent, who had more rebounding
strength and better speed. This
enabled Strong Vincent to quickly
take control of the game. The
“strongmen” owned the boards with
the spectacular performance of
Dickens, who recorded 20 points
and 17 rebounds. He had help on the
inside from John Blanks, a 6-4 for-
ward who had 15 points and 13
rebounds. Dickens and Blanks
quickly made their rebounding abil-
ity known by out-rebounding the
Nanticoke team 10-6 in the first
quarter.

Pandemonium broke out among
the large Vincent crowd in the
second quarter when Dickens
blocked a shot near the top of the
key, grabbed the rebound and broke
free for a double-pumping slam
dunk. Chants of “Tree" could be
heard throughout the Vincent sec-
tion. This gave the Colonels a 25-16

- goal

lead and all the momentum they
needed.

Nanticoke never got back into the
game. Vincent’s man-to-man
defense frustrated Nanticoke all
night. Sharpshooter Matt Harris
had 16 points from the outside, and
Mike Smith, who ran the offense.
scored 5 points.

Girls Class AAA .

1n the girl‘s Class AAA final, Deer
Lakes overcame a 19-point halftime
deficit to defeat Palmyra 45-43.

The Deer Lakes team that played
in the second half was a determined
team, a team with a mission. They
did not play like the team who in the
first half didn’t score until six min-
utes had elapsed, made six of22 field
attempts and were out-
rebounded 23-10. Rather, the
WPIAL champions played the kind
of basketball that got them to the
state finals.

Deer Lakes came out using a man-
to-man defense, which Palmyra
guard Tammy Powell broke for an
easy lay-up, extending the lead to
32-13. Then the comeback began,
with guard Terri Gizienski leading
the way. Deer Lakes proceeded to
outscore Palmyra 17-1 and caused
Palmyra to make 17 second-half

chance to travel.

Kathy Suvoy gave Deer Lakes its

Alger regained the lead for Palmyra
with a driving lay-up. Erica Good-

throw gave Deer Lakes a 43-41 lead
with only 3:40 remaining.

Deer Lakes lost the ball three
times on fouls and turnovers. Pal-
myra’s Vineta Daiga was able to
capitalize once when she got inside
for a lay-up.

With 26 seconds remaining and
the score tied, Gizienski traveled,
turning the ball over to Palmyra.
However, nine seconds later, Alger
lost control ofa dribble. Deer Lakes
took advantage of the situation:
Gizienski passed underneath to
Rearick for the easy bucket and the
win.

Pittsburgh women’s rugby team
wins two of three in Virginia

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News;

The Pittsburgh women’s rugby
team now holds a record of 4-1 after
a successful weekend of play at the
Virginia Commonwealth Club
Tournament. The Angels took third
place in the eight-team tournament,
behind the Florida State Select Side
and Iris _of Virginia. In Saturday‘s
competition, Pittsburgh beat V1,-
ginia Tech 23-3 but was shut out by
the Florida Select Side 38-0. Sun-
day’s action brought about another
win for the ‘Angels as they defeated
the University of Virginia I0-4.

According to Pittsburgh's match
secretary Leslie Bertel, the Florida

Select Side is mostly made up of
players from the University of Flor-
ida team, which is the best women‘s
rugby team in the country. Bertel
was happy with her team’s perfor-
mance at the tournament.

“We did very well considering we
have so many new people on the
team,” she said.

The women on the Pittsburgh
team come from a variety of back-
grounds, ranging from teachers to
students — and even a mother.
These women have all elected to
make time in their busy schedules
for rugby — but why‘?

“I try to work around the practi-
ces as much as possible because
rugby is addictive," said Siobhan
Grayson, who plays wing and full-
back for the Angels. “Once vou play

rugby you want to play more
rugby.” Grayson is a graduate stu-
dent in Pitt's School of Social Work.

Rugby‘s reputation of being a
dangerous sport is not justified.
Although protective padding is
limited, rugby injuries tend to be less
severe than football injuries because
of rules prohibiting blocking. The
sport requires excellent overall con-
ditioning and provides a competitive
atmosphere.

“Its a ruffian sport that’s been civ-
ilized. The camaraderie is great, and
it’s just plain fun," said Grayson.

The Pittsburgh women’s rugby
team will compete in its next match
on April 13 with Buffalo and Cornell
at Buffalo. The team is always open
to new members. Information can
be obtained from Leslie Bertel at

PIAA state championships

continued from page sixteen

McCort trailed by 10 in the first
half and went into the intermission
trailing by five at 32-27. They were
led by 6-9 center Paul Diedert‘s
points and I8 rebounds, but it was
not enough as Shanahan gave up the
lead only once in the game when
McCort brieﬂy led 37-36 in the third
quarter.

Girls Class AA

While the Bishop McCort boys
were unable to bring a state title to
Johnstown, the McCort girls team
did so with a vengence in defeating
Pine Grove 73-49.

Melanie Bach, a‘5-4 guard, was
McCort’s leading scorer with a

game-high 26 points.

The Bishop McCort girls didn't
start rolling until the second quarter,
trailing Pine Grove 19-I4 after the
first eight minutes. It was the second
period that set the tone for the rest of
the game, with McCort blazing to a

22-8 stretch during the second

period.

Boys Class A

Reading Central Catholic came
from behind to defeat Midland 55-
47 in overtime. Reading was led to
victory by 6-3 center,_ Brian Menet
who had 20 points and I5 rebounds.

With l:l2 remaining in the game.
it appeared as if Midland was going
to win its sixth state championship.
Leading 43-37 Midland guard Dion
Hill was at the line with an oppor-
tunity to extend the lead to seven.
Midland players began to celebrate.
This show of emotion proved to be
premature, for Hill missed the free
throw. The young Midland team
then fell apart as Reading and
Menet took over. Reading‘s David
Strickler hit a 15-foot jumper from
the left corner. Reading then forced
a Midland turnover, driving Joe
Wentling toward the base
drawing the fifth foul on Mid1and’s
Kevin Kirkland. Wentling missed

the free throw. However, Menet was
able to get the rebound and score an
easy lay-up, cutting the Midland
lead to two.

Midland’s Chris Tookes was
fouled as he tried to bring the ball
upcourt, then failed to convert the
front end of a one-on—one. Reading
brought the ball back down-court,
and Menet banked a I5-footer from
the right side, sending the game into
overtime. It was all Reading in over-
time, as John Iswalt scored six
points and Wentling made three free
throws.

Girls Class A

Cheryl Trumbo and Tracy Herb
led Schuylkill Haven to an amazing
47-28 victory over Linesville.

At halftime. Schuylkill Haven
had a 22-21 lead. They held Lines-
ville scoreless in the third period and
two minutes of the fourth. Schuyl-
kill Haven outscored Linesville 25-7
in the second half. Both Trumbo and
Herb had 20 points toward the win.
