University Purchases Methane

By DAN ROSENTHAL
Pitt News Staff Writer

A highly «sensitive, portable
hydrocarbon analyzer capable of
detecting methane, a major ingre-
dient of natural gas, has been
purchased by the University.

The unit, which cost $3365, “can
detect even very small leaks in
pipes before they become dan-
gerous,” Eugene Barry, Pitt’s
health and safety officer, said.

“After La-ngley Hall, there were
a number of calls to the University

from people saying they smelled

’ gas,” Barry said.‘

Most of the calls failed to turn up
any leaks‘, according to Barry, “but
this new device will help us detect
methane even before the nose
can.” —

An explosion at Langley Hall last
Jan. 20 killed two women and
injured some 70 other persons.
Natural gas has been cited as a
plausible cause by County Coroner
Cyril Wecht.

Proposed Student Union renova-

from Chancellor Posvar and other
top University officials last week,
according to William F. (“Bud”)
Heaps, director of student activi-
ties.

The project, considered for the
past six years, had not reached this
level before, Heaps said.

The project will affect the
basement and lower seventh ﬂoors.
All academic departments now
housed in the building will be
moved out as other space becomes
available. The only exception is the
math department. which will
remain on the upper ﬂoors of the
Union.
Max Andrews has been hired as
_ the project's consultant. Heaps

the gas mains at Pitt,” Barry said.
“This new piece of equipment will
be used to supplement the gas
company’s monitoring.”

Pitt owns other gas-detecting
instruments, but this one is
probably the most sensitive,
accordingto Barry.

“With this model that Pitt has
purchased, a 0.1 parts per million
(ppm) sample of methane can be
detected." Steve Bayer, the
product's salesman. said.

“Methane’s explosive limit is
about 30,000 ppm so the equipment
is fairly sensitive,” Bayer said.

“It was expensive," Barry said,
“but considering its capability, if
we find one leak it will be well
worth the cost.” ’

Though a schedule for use has
not been drawn up yet, Barry says
the analyzer will have a variety of
applications.

“We’ll be able to check not only
existing facilities but new installa-
tions also,” he said. “Pipe ﬁttings

Special Office Merges
Commuters,‘ Vets

By DEANNA LOUISE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Three student affairs offices are
pooling manpower to examine two
dissimilar long-term dilemmas:
commuter life and the dissemina-
tion of University literature to
students.

The three offices—off-campus
housing, veterans affairs and
disabled students—compose the
new Office of Special Student
Services. directed by Jack Hayes.

The focus on commuters will be
comprehensive, including the
10,000 graduate studentg, interna-
tional students, undergraduate

commuters and continuing educa-

tion and School of General Studies
students.

4With only 4,000 undergraduates
in the dormitories, Hayes said,
about 90 percent of the students
commute.

and connectiions can be tested for
any possible leakage.”

“A researcher may be working
with a certain gas and might have
us check their exposure to that

gas,” Barry said.
(Continued on Page 3)

“We’re not going to limit the
definition of commuters,” Hayes
said. ,

The special services staff will
augment the ad hoc Committee on
Commuter Representation formed
by the Student Government last

month.
The heterogeneous nature .of

commuters makes the duties of
special services personnel ambig-
uous, Hayes said, although he did
emphasize his staff will not be
performing a direct-line service to
commuters. A more likely
objective of special services is the
arousal of a commuter conscious-
ness on campus.

Hayes and Acting Vice Chancel-

lor for Student Affairs William ,

Marcus are weighing alternatives,
but do not expect a plan of action in
the commuter arena for several
weeks, Hayes said.

A second special services project
—the dissemination of University
schedules and course literature-
will, Hayes hopes, determine the
most efficient means of informing
students.

The wealth of pamphlets and
catalogues circulating on campus
needs to be assessed, Hayes said.
He emphasized his office will not
be a clearinghouse for catalogues

complete by spring, 1978.

Pitt Instructor Resigns,
Charges Ethnic Bias

By TOM KUKUCKA
and DAN McKAY

Pitt News Staff Writers

A Pitt instructor this week
charged the University adminis-
tration with ethnic and racial
discrimination in the employment
practices of faculty members.

Father Ivan Dornic announced his
resignation from his position as
instructor and lecturer in the
University’s slavic language
department in protest over the
alleged discrimination.

The announcement was made at a
press conference Tuesday after-
noon at the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel.

Domic, a Greek Orthodox priest
at St. Macrina Church in Monon-
gahela, has taught at Pitt for the
past four years.

Dornic cited alleged injustices
against Pitt teachers of Slavic origin
in his accusation.

“The University of Pittsburgh
has a plan,” Domic said, “known
as the Gibian-Mathewson report.
That plan calls for the ﬁring of
Slavic professors. The slavic
population in Pittsburgh is high.
We make up 46 percent of the
general population, so we should
have a higher percentage of
teaching‘ positions, but we do not.
Professors of Slavic origin are under
four percent of full-tirne faculty
members.”

Domic claimed the plan is used
by Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg. Dean
Rosenberg could not be reached for
comment. '

“We have a copy of the plan that
Dean Rosenberg said he was going
to implement, and he is doing it,”
Domic said. Cases of black teachers
whose contracts were not renewed
also were discussed at thecpress
conference. A

Dornic indicated the departments

officials) are coming sometime in
October to investigate,” Dornic
said.

Dornic expressed hope that other
professors in the Slavic department
would support his protest and also
submit resignations.

discovered there were problems,”
Dornic said, they began to

Saxon believed the struggle
against Pitt would be a long and
arduous one.

The problem, according to Saxon,
is that Pitt has power that reached

Saxon said that because the

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

A Common Problem

That Pitt does very little for commuters is once again becoming
evident, this time in a deteriorating Commons Rooms. It is clear
that something must be done to arrest the deterioration; it is
equally clear that throwing out the lunching commuters is not the

solution.

The often-ignored commuters, seeking a decent place to eat in a
crowded Oakland, have adopted the Commons Room as their base
for lunch, studying and socializing. This is good.

It also is often ignored that the Commons Room is a historical
lan_dmark because of its architecture. The viewing of that architec-
ture, however, has been obscured lately by a growing mass of em-
pty lunch bags and discarded Burger Chef wrappings. This is not

good.

Several solutions, ranging from evicting the lunchtime crowd to
adding a team of janitors, come to mind. The best, however, is to
allow commuters to use the room and provide proper receptacles
for trash, which according to Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs

William Marcus, are lacking.

If, after a time, the commuters

demonstrate an unwillingness to police their ranks, restrictions on
eating could be considered. But that must be a final resort, since
that solution would only create another, perhaps bigger problem.
Commuters must go somewhere between classes. The Commons
Room seems to be the perfect place. But commuters will rightly
lose that privilege if they insist upon keeping their temporary quar-

ters decidedly imperfect.

McCormick Resident Cuts Sorority Noise

I would like to criticize Pitt's
sororities for the lack of considera-
tion and the outright rudeness they
show where other residents of the
Quad are concerned. The noise
that they create during their
outdoor songfests is intolerable and
distracting. I say noise because
two hundred girls screaming at the
top of their lungs cannot possibly

be considered music, in my
opinion.

Aside from the issue of consid-
eration, University quiet hours are
supposed to be in effect at 8 p.m.
But these girls insist on singing at
all hours, disturbing my studying
and often, my sleep. It is really sad
when you cannot carry on a
conversation in normal tones in

What Happened to Adams?

All right, Mr. Richard Trocano
has proved himself a capable
quarterback in the absence of Matt
Cavanaugh. With rumors of
Cavanaugh’s return imminent,
everything looks nice and rosy for
the Pitt Panthers. Now, Mr. Jackie
Sherrill, I would like to know what
happened to Wayne Adams.
Remember him? Yes, he was the
player who consistently fumbled
the snaps, could not run the option
and gave the Pitt offense the
effectiveness that a high school
team would have against the
Oakland Raiders.

Against Notre Dame, Wayne’s
performance was far from ade-
quate. but one must consider his
lack of experience in college

"football and his short time of

practice with the starting offense.

I think it has been said more than
enough that Wayne was not at

fault for the Notre Dame ﬁasco. Of
course, that is not the point I want
to make. I want to know why
Wayne Adams has not been given a
second chance? Everyone and his
brother played against Temple,
except Wayne Adams. He has
gotten no closer to the Dlayingﬁeld
since that infamous Saturday than
Chancellor Posvar.

Why, Jackie, hasn’t Wayne
played again? Wasn't he your
number two quarterback at the
beginning of the season? I feel one
outing against a number one rated
college team, lack of any real
collegeexperience and the pres-
sure of defending a national
championship is not a fair test of a
player's ability. I hope, for your
sake, Jackie, that Wayne Adams
does not come back to haunt you
someday.

Richard Cook

your own room in a lower ﬂoor suite
overlooking the Quad. Even a shut
window doesn’t drown out the
screeching and generally obnox-
ious behavior of these girls.

In addition to the outdoor
singing, I often __ hear t ~
screaming top 40 songs from th Y1’
suites at 1 a.m. I think this is
ridiculous and should be stopped.
The sororities have every right to
sing all they want, but they should
conﬁne this immature behavior to
earlier hours or ﬁnd a more isolated
spot—-like Tibet——in which to carry
on.

If the sororities are supposed to
represent the good sportsmanship
and spirit at Pitt. then I am
ashamed to be a Pitt student. They
are being very unsportsmanlike
and their overabundance of spirit is
nauseating. Spirit is for football
games and pep rallies, not for 10- .5
on a Monday night. I, for one, <3
not care to hear their cheers,
songs and other behavior and ask
that the girls consider this behavior
an imposition on other Quad
residents. I see no reason why their
activities could not be modiﬁed to
consider everyone’s feelings.

Western Pennsyleania Citizens for Justice

Demand Rosenberg Eamlanation

Edltor’s note: The following is a
letter from the Western Pennsyl-
vania Citizens for Justice at Pitt
[WPCJP] to Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg.
It was forwarded to this newspaper
by the WPCJP.

This letter revolves around two
central issues with which we are
concerned: (1) your arbitrary and
racist decision in denying tenure to
Professor Anugo Patrick Ntukogu;
and (2) your willful and malicious
deceit in dealing with W. Pa.
Citizens for Justice at Pitt on this
issue.

Letter Policy

The‘ PITT NEWS wel-
comes letters from its
readers. Letters intended
for publication should be
‘typewritten. double-
spaced. and signed by the
author. who should in-
dicate his University at-
filiation, if any. The PITT
NEWS reserves the right to
edit all letters. and sub-
missions no longer than four
paragraphs Will be con-
sidered for earliest
publication.

As we have repeatedly expressed

' to you our support for Prof.

Ntukogu, we are dismayed and
angered not only by your decision to
deny tenure, but also by the
arbitrary manner in which it was
made. Your negative decision and
failure to form a tenure review
committee fall into the repulsive
pattern of systematic discrimination
that we are ﬁghting against at Pitt
(see enclosed section on racism.)
As a committee, we would be
interested in how you gathered such
expertise in black studies that you
feel qualiﬁed to overturn ﬁve of the
last six departmental personnel
decisions? Has there been another
department with which you have
done the same?
Certainly at stake here is the very
life and autonomy of the black
studies department. It would
seem that a strongly supportive
positive recommendation from
black studies chairman Curtiss
Porter regarding tenure decisions
has been reduced to a futile and
meaningless exercise in writing.
We would also ask why the
chairman of black studies, Curtiss
Porter, is not himself a tenured
associate professor. It is clear that
anyone in black studies who has
fought for the development of black

studies as a discipline and as an
integral part of the community; runs
contrary to Pitt’s racist policies and
has no chance for attaining tenure at
Pitt. -
As concerns your vicious deceit
with W. Pa. Citizens for Justice at
Pitt, representing taxpayers and
students, it is unpardonable.
During the phone conversation of
August 18, 1977, you indicated to
me your support of tenure for Prof.
Ntukogu. Also you stated that it
would be six weeks before the
decision could be formally approved
because of the necessity of
convening the necessary faculty to
form a committee. On our letter of
August 31st, we stated our
satisfaction at your indicated
support for Prof. Ntukogu and our
concern at what we felt was the
unnecessary delayin forming the
tenure review committee of which
you had spoken, especially since the
tenure decision should have been
made in April. We also asked for
and expected a reply on this matter.
Since you have had neither the
courtesy nor the common decency to

respond, we must speculate as to .

why? Perhaps since you never
formed the tenure review commit-
tee you had spoken of, you didn’t

Reader Saw A Different Concert

I feel compelled to comment on
Dan McKay's review of the Ronnie
Laws/Al Jarreau concert that
appeared in the September 30 issue

of the Pitt News.
McKay’s article lied. Laws was

booed and a sizable percentage of
the audience walked out after he
left the stage three times within the

ﬁrst 45 minutes of his set. _ _
It seems that McKay. delirious

with having interviewed Laws. felt
compelled to write a rave. no
matter what. This sort of thing
does nothing for music journalism

in general and the Pitt News in
particular.

But most offensive was McKay's

gloss of Al Jarreau’s extraordinary

performance. Clearly. it was
Jarreau’s night and Jarreau’s
show.

It is one thing to disagree with
the qualitative degree of a show;
it's quite another to know the

difference between kind. Mc ‘ i

did not tell the truth.

Letters to the Editor

On behalf of all the Philadelphia

supporter) I would like to object to

for the explicit purpose of
degrading and humiliating an
awsome baseball team. l an

which appeared in last Wednes-

day’s Pitt News.
Since this atrocity has already

only intellegent recourse is not only
to enlighten the members of the

undigniﬁed cartoon to appear, but

The review of last weekend's
concert of the Pittsburgh Symphony
in the October 3 issue of The Pitt
News prompts criticism of The Pitt
News’ policy regarding the ac-

lacy and professionalism of the
publication. The blatant innac-
curacies and irrelevant commentary
present in this review, as well as
those present in the review of two
weeks ago, suggest that neither the
music critic nor the editors of The
Pitt News are aware of the critic’s
proper function.

- The critic’s function is to utilize
his supposedly greater perception
of, in this case, music. The critic
uses his greater knowledge of the
elements of music to point out to
those less well-educated and less
studied in listening what happened
in__a given performance, good and
,' 6, so that we may become better
listeners. This function demands
integrity on the part of the critic. He
must conﬁne himself to the music
before him and describe what
actually happened, not what he
would like to have happened.

Diehard Phillie Fan Looks On the Bright Side

    

Reader
Thus, when Lynne Mayers says

that ‘ ‘Previn and the orchestra were
suave, overly-mannered and
underplayed, as if the Russian
pieces were background music to a
well made Hollywood ﬁlm,” she is
using a metaphor that has no
relevance to the music at hand.
Hollywood ﬁlms have many kinds of
music represented. The statement
means nothing. Her statement also
confuses precise attacks and clear
texture, two of the most difﬁcult
qualities for a conductor to achieve,
with mannered phrasing. They are
not the same. Previn’s clear
textures allow one to hear all the
music in its true proportion’ and
enables one to follow every element
of the harmony and melody. It
makes the music well played and
accurate to the composer's inten-
tions.

In describing Prokoﬁev’s Seventh
symphony as a dirge without
explaining why (I ﬁnd it to be
brilliant and vital, for instance),
Meyers does Prokoﬁev and us a
great disservice. It is unprofes-

few, if any, of the optional changes
being accepted,” Heaps said.

' Among the ideas .being con-
sidered are the addition of an ice
cream parlor, a newsstand, a pub
and several multi-purpose rooms.

“We need more multi-purpose
rooms.” Heaps said. “There is a
possibility we will expand the
building by adding floors on top of
the recreation room, but that’s up
to the architects.

“All the services in the building

sional and uncritical. It is mere
bombast. To call the fourth
movement of a symphony a coda is
not only unprofessional, it is wrong.
And to suggest that it was like the
hunting music to “Peter and the
Wolf” only suggests that she has
never heard that piece of music.
The similarity is not there. Previn
did not make the ﬁrst movement
“grandiose and epic’ ’ either. Those
terms convey nothing about the
music; they are literary terms.
Neither are the other three
movements “light and

too slow and somber to be described
by anyone who heard it as “light”
or “mischievous.”

League East crown. but they have
also managed to produce the
second-best record in major league
baseball. Many of these wins were

amassed by Steve “Lefty” Carlton.
“Lefty” won 23 games, not to

mention the fact he was fourth in
the league in ERA and strikeouts.

He is a deﬁnite shoe-in for the Cy
Young Award. Yet even with all
these vital statistics working in his
favor, Carlton is not the key to the
Phillies. The real key to the
Phillies is Greg “Bull” Luzinski.

For to speak of this amazing team
and not mention Luzinski’s name is
as blasphemous as talking about
Oakland and not mentioning its

bars. ' _

intellectualizing a performance has
no bearing on reality. Was
Meyers’s review intellectualized
because she bent down over her
typewriter to write it? And what
does the soloist’s demeanor have to
do with his performance? We go to
listen, not to look. Meyers‘ also
mistakes for poor playing the fact
that Rachmaninov’s score is a
jumble of notes, harmony and
counterpoint with poor thematic
development, in my’ judgment, and
is orchestrated with so many voices
and so loudly that it obscures any
musical idea that may be present.

Gutierrez’s technical abilities, on
the other hand, were impressive. .I
have heard the concerto when it was

smacked 39 home runs.

absolute limits and list the
contributions that each and every
Phillie produced for their club but
that is not my intent. I feel it will
sufﬁce if I can just point out to you
that the Philadelphia Phillies are
not. chokers. The concept of the
word choke does not entail having
players of Carlton or Luzinski’s
caliber on a club. Nor does it entail
winning the National League East
for the past two yers with a good
chance of winning it all this year.

because the conductor and soloist
were unbalanced and playing
beyong their technical abilities.
And as for the trumpets not playing
“above a whisper,” not only did
they play as loudly as Prokoﬁev
asked in the score, they played so
loudly that their sour notes were as
distinguishable as, unfortunately,
they frequently are.

In short, if Meyers cannot conﬁne

Blood Donors

By PETER J. BUTCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

If you're a blood donor. every
pint you give can beneﬁt three
persons. And you’re also part of a
minority. Only ﬁve percent of all
people able to give blood actually
do so.

According to the director of
Pittsburgh’s Central Blood Bank,
Dr. Ronald Gilcher, donated blood
is separated into red blood cells,
plasma and platelets. Depending
on the ailment, patients receive any

air all of the three fractions.

Ten million units of blood are
used annually in the United
States, a country of approximately
100 million eligible donors. One
million eligible donors live in
Allegheny, where 100,000 units
per year are needed.

“If all those who could give
blood actually gave, they only
would need to donate once every
10 years,” -Gilcher said. “But in
Allegheny County, the 50,000 to
60,000 people who give must do
so twice a year.”

“At the blood bank, we’re
trying to encourage people to
donate blood to fulﬁll their

zimmittment to their commun-
ity.” Gilcher continued.

Central Blood Bank was organ-
ized in 1949 and began operation
in. 1951. It supplies 30 hospitals

with the blood fractions needed

for patient care.

Gilcher has been the blood
bank’s director since 1971. He
was a 1959 Pitt graduate, received
his M.D. from Jefferson Medical
College in 1963 and studied for
two years under a hematology
fellowship following his intern-
ship and residency. He was a
consultant at the Army’s Walter
Reed Hospital, where he special-
ized in the ﬁeld of transfusion
hematology, from 1968 to 1971.

From 1950 until February 1976,
the Central Blood Bank operated
under the premise that it was the
patient’s responsibility to provide
donors to replace the blood he
received.
the patient’s obligation either to
replace the blood or pay a
_responsibility fee for blood not
replaced. The blood bank,
through a family or group
assurance plan, provided a means

‘to eliminate this obligation ahead

of time.
Gilcher explained why that
system was dropped. “I, and

others in the organization, felt it

pl-‘EATURES\

On that basis, it was

was unfair to put a burden on the
person least able to replace the
blood used.

“The Red Cross,” Gilcher
continued. “operates under the
premise that it is the community’s
responsibility to give blood. So
Central Blood Bank dropped the
non-replacement fee and only
asks the patient to attempt to have
the blood replaced.”

Gilcher said the new system
created havoc at ﬁrst, since

Innocent Deaths J ustifyWar

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staff Writer

In the early ’40s, when she was a
nuclear physicist, Joan Hinton
involved herself in a project that
was to reshape the 'course of
modern history.

She was part of a team of
American scientists that worked
toward the production of the atom
bomb, the purpose of which.
Hinton then believed, was to act
solely as a deterrent to the growing

at ‘at of World War II fascism.

But the military turned the tables
as to the weapon's purpose,
resulting in the destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and‘ the
subsequent advent of the “Nuclear
Age."

“We were very upset our work
led to this." Hinton would recall.
“We werejust scientists interested
in how the world was put
together."

She found herself to be “in a
vise"; the only positions involving

‘Lear physics were tied to the
g vernment or military. a situation
of which Hinton wanted no part.

After the war. she decided to
leave the country; her destination.
China. By Hinton’s account: “I
had to see the United States from

S N

 

 

the outside. I knew what I was
against, but I didn’t know what I
was for.” _

Wednesday night, in a presenta-
tion to a small crowd in the
Graduate School of Public Health
auditorium, Hinton chronicled her
life in China for, the past 29 years,
utilizing slides and a sharp memory
for detail.

She touched on the first years of
her new life: the problems in
reaching her destination in the
liberated areas of revolution-torn

Joan Hinton, an American nuclear physicist who has lived in China for the past

China: 1 her first job in an
iron-producing factory, her life on a
farm in Upper Mongolia.

Hinton labeled herself a paciﬁst
at that time, but her attitude
quickly changed with the Japanese
invasion of China.

“War is justiﬁed when innocents
are killed,” Hinton said. “If
they’re going to shoot at you, then
it’s correct to shoot back at them.”

“My thinking quickly changed
under those circumstances,” she
added. “I envied those with guns.”

    

29 years, lectured here Wednesday night on her experiences.

Pittsburghers were not familiar
with the Red Cross’s community
responsibility system.

Insurance companies thus do
not pay the responsibility fee
another blood bank might charge.
But even in the Central Blood
Bank,there is no such thing as
free blood. Numerous tests must
be performed on the blood,
Gilcher explained. “Not all blood
gets out of here,” he said. “Our
labs ﬁnd things that make it
unusable. As a result of these
lab tests, there is a processing
charge that must be paid by a
third party.”

Central Blood Bank charges a
$35 processing fee, paid by the
patient’s insurance company.

“Anyone in Allegheny County
hospitals who needs blood gets it
without- a responsibility fee,"
Gilcher stated. “One doesn't
have to be a member of Central
Blood Bank to get the beneﬁts.

“I give two to three units of
blood per year,” Gilcher con-
tinued, “and I hope there is
someone out there who will do the
same if I need it.

“Giving blood isn't pleasant,
but after the ﬁrst needle there’s

< -(2/’ .

little discomfort to it,” Gilcher
said.

Gilcher explained a person can
give blood every eight weeks, but
he recommends a donation only
two to three times per year. On
the day of donation, a donor
should eat normally (no big
meals) and go to the blood bank‘
for a screening procedure. A drop
of blood is sampled from a ﬁnger,
and the donor’s blood pressure,
temperature, pulse and general
condition is checked by a nurse.

The actual donation only takes
10 minutes. “If blood is drawn
past 10 minutes,” Gilcher said,
T‘the blood in the collecting sac
goes bad. So after 10 minutes the
process is stopped, whether a
whole unit was collected or not.”

The donor then is asked to rest
for 10 minutes before leaving.
The entire visit takes 45 minutes
to one hour.

Gilcher considers Central Blood
Bank unique because of the other
services it offers. “It’s not just-a
collection and distribution cen-
ter,” he said. “It’s a reference
facility and area of expertise for
the state and the nation.”

  Donors Respond 

To Disasters

(Continued from Page 7)

The bank performs tasks such
as finding compatible blood types
for problem patients. It also is the
hemophilia center for western
Pennsylvania.

An outpatient transfusion ser-
vice, also is offered. According to
Gilcher, doctors send patients
who no longer need hospital care
to the Central Blood Bank to
receive required blood transfu-
sions.

The blood bank also has a
Pheresis Division._ Pheresis is a
process that takeds blood from a
donor, runs it through a blood cell
separator to remove the desired
fraction, returns the remaining
fractions to the donor and
transfuses the extracted fraction
to the patient. Pheresis obtains
blood cells for a patient from a
close relative. This lessens the
chance of rejection.

A new innovation tested at the
blood bank is autologous transfu-
sion, which utilizes frozen blood.
A new method allows the Central
Blood Bank to freeze blood and
store it indeﬁnitely. When a
patient is due for elective surgery,
his doctor can opt to have him
donate blood, to be used for
transfusion during the operation,
ahead of time. According to
Gilcher, this is the safest
transfusion method _known be-

introduced into the patient’s
body.

The question of whether a blood
bank should charge patients a
responsibility fee has sparked
controversy in this country. The
state of California is suing a major
blood bank in Los Angeles over its
penalty replacement fee.

“The case is being watched
from across the country,” Gilcher
said, “because it pits two major
blood donation organizations
aganist each other.”

The American Association of
Blood Banks (AABB) supports the
responsibility fee, Gilcher ex-
plained, while the Council of
Community Blood Centers
(CCBC) opposes the fee.

Gilcher related an example of
the conﬂict between the two
organizations. A patient who
lived in Philadelphia, a CCBC

. community. went to the Hershey

Medical Center to be treated for
leukemia. The center belonged to
the AABB, which had a system
requiring recipients to replace
each unit of blood they use, with
two units or pay a responsibility
fee of $60 per unit.

The patient received 40 units of
platelets, and died without
replacing them. His widow was
sacked with a $4,800 fee.

“The widow went to her state
senator,” Gilcher said, “and he
formed a committee that investi-_
gated thematter and drew up an
agreement arranging for patients
to recieve blood from their own
area, no matter where they are
hospitalized.”

Gilcher was pleased the agree-

ment was reached without the
-involvement of the entire State
Legislature. ‘‘I don’t want them
to make a political football out of
it." he said.

Two countries have no shortage
of blood donors. People in
England and Switzerland donate
much more blood per capita than
do Americans. Gilcher has found
two different reasons for this
phenomenon. p

The English have had a

phenomenal blood donation rate
since their backs were against the
wall in World War II. “When
there is a disaster, everyone
wants to help in some way,”
Gilcher said. “When Langley
Hall exploded, we had 1,500
people who wanted to donate to a
facility that could only process 500
people per day. People we turned
away were mad because we
wouldn’t bleed them."

When the British government
faced a similar do or die situation,
Gilcher said, people donated en
masse. The same spirit continues
there today.

Tiny Switzerland gives half as
much blood as the entire United
States. The Swiss give so much
blood that at one time, they had to
throw out excess red blood cells.
Now, through a Swiss Red Cross
program called Euroblood, some
of these cells are exported here.

“I wish we didn’t have to rely
on their blood,” Gilcher said,

   

 

Swiss Blood Imported As ‘

“but I’m glad we can get it.”

He postulated that the com-
munal villages in the Swiss
mountains produce communtiy-
oriented citizens who band
together and look after each
other.

Donors can no longer give blood
at Central Blood Bank’s building
on De Soto St. in Oakland. That
location is exclusively a pheresis
and transfusion center, and also
contains laboratories. Gilcher

’ said the blood bank will be

relocated, possibly in a University
building.

As for the other Oakland blood
collecting center, Sera-Tec Bio-
logical, Gilcher said this center,
which buys plasma from donors,
is legitimate and does not much
affect Central Blood Bank busi-
ness.

“These places exist,” Gilcher
said, “because of a need for
plasma for the generation of

plasma deI‘lVaIlV6S, such as
albumen for surgery and burn
patients and an anti-hemophilia
factor for hemophiliacs. ’

“These centers generally are
found in two areas, universities
where students need money and
skid row areas where the quality
of blood collected is not high,” he
said. -

As for the unpaid Central Blood
Bank doners: “People give here
idealistically,” Gilcher said, “to
help their community.”

Audience ‘Spellbound’ Chicago ﬂ/ins ‘I/ith 
By Ponty’s Jazz Style

By DAN McKAY

Jean-Luc Ponty and his band
kept a less-than-packed house
spellbound Wednesday night with
their distinct brand of jazz.
Although popular with the audi-
ence, the electric violin Ponty plays
is hardly a standard instrument in
jazz bands.

The band opened with “Taran-
tula,” from the album “Imaginary
Voyage,” which preceded their
latest, “Enigmatic Ocean.” From
“Ocean,” they played a frying
version of “Mirage” and “Song of
the Turtle to the Sea,” during
which each band member took an
extended solo.

The rest of the evening’s music
was good balanced, old, familiar
material with the title track of the
new album.

The crowd at the Mosque was

primed for Ponty’s electric turn-on '

by the smooth, tasty acoustic guitar
work of Earl Klugh. Overcoming
technical mishaps caused by a
rushed sound check, Klugh per-
formed his special arrangements of

"tunes, ranging from “I Heard It

Through the Grapevien” and “The
Look of Love” to the title track of
his latest album, “Living Inside
Your Love.”

Klugh’s guitar technique at
times showed a George Benson
inﬂuence, perhaps due to the two

albums Benson and Klugh jammed
on together.

Interestingly, Klugh has played
many gigs with Ponty’s bass
player, Ralphe Armstrong. When
Ponty introduced his band, he
called Armstrong “the king of
Detroit funk.”

Armstrong did nothing to adbi-
cate his reign, laying down juicy
licks and occasionally throwing on a
distortion pedal. When asked
about this distortion, he explained,
“it imitates the sound of the
bow...a lagato sound...similar to
the ponticelloi sound of the bass
violin.”

Armstrong said he will use a
bass violin in future concerts, but
“right now I don’t have a bass I can
take on the road.”

The rest of Ponty’s band fits a
rock’n’roll instrumentation: two
elecric guitars, keyboards and
drums. But the music is
unmistakably jazz, despite the
band’s unorthodox instrumentation
and the fact that most of its music
is written in classically-inﬂuenced
three- and four-movement pieces.

Guitar player Jim -Glaser, who
could pass for Sonny Bono, said
“composition’s the strongest part”
of the band’s music, but added that
the ﬂexibility of each performance
greatly enhances ‘the tight com-
positions. Ponty, who composes all

‘Between the Lines’ j
A Different Type of Film   From Pittsburgh

To Hollywood

By LEONARD ROMBERG

Pitt News Staff Writer .
“When people think of Pitts-
burgh. . .all the jokes are about Pitts-

burgh,” Jeff Goldblum admitted.
Yet the seasoned actor of both
stage and film is proud to be a
Pittsburgh native. Goldblum
expressed these thoughts while
returning to the city for a brief_visit
before going back to Hollywood.
He has just bolstered a blossom-
ing career with his performance of

I Max in ‘ ‘Between the Lines,” a film

that opened Wednesday. In
addition to that, he has just
completed his next film, “Thank
God Its Friday,” yet to be released.

Goldblum left Pittsburgh in 1970
to study acting in New York.
“Before I can ever remember, I’ve
wanted to act,” he said. He
understudied for “Two Gentlemen
of Verona” on Broadway and then
performed in an off-Broadway play,
“El Grande De Coca-Cola.”

That is how he made his
Hollywood connection. “Robert
Altman saw me in El Grande De
Coca-Cola,” he said, explaining his
entry into “California Split” and

“Nashville,” in which he played

the motorcycle man.

“Between The Lines” allows the
moviegoer to look inside the hectic
newsroom of a Boston neighbor-
hood paper that used to break great
stories, but is currently living on
past success. The reporters have

Even if one had known nothing
about them or had never seen them
before, one would know how
popular Chicago was by witnessing
the welcome they received Wednes-
day night at the Civic Arena.

The group was introduced.
James Pankow, the gro_up’s trom-
bone player, said good evening, and
amid the cheers of many avid fans
the band swung into the strong beat
and lively horns of “Make Me
Smile”. »

The lights went down and Robert
Lamm started the piano of “Color
My World.” The piano soon mixed
with soft ﬂutes to produce the sound
that made the song a hit.

The band then swung into a lively
musical piece that contained a little
of everything: Trombone, trumpet,
guitars, congas, Daniel Seraphine’s
drums and Lamm’s keyboards. The
crowd loved it and Pankow
encouraged them to clap along. The

enthusiasm of the fans was
contagious, and one could not help
but be impressed.

The group then moved to the
strong beat and keyboards of
“Wake Up Sunshine,” from their
second album, then hit the audience
with selections from the new
Chicago XI album. Chicago now
features more guitar and beat, but

-less brass then previously. One
might notice there’s also a little
more funk. The new pieces will
probably enjoy the same wide-

and report muck.

Goldblum plays the music editor
and rock critic of the Back Bay

which the ﬁlm focuses. Goldblum.

character that could give him the
same popularity, following and
stereotype Henry Winkler endures.-

Typical of the character he
portrays, Goldblum is not worried
about being stereotyped. saying he
has portrayed many characters.

Max. a freeloader. enjoys that
freedom of spirit. He is seen
lounging in his chair, wrapped in
headphones. tapping his foot while
reviewing the latest in rock music.

Goldblum sees the film mostly as
entertainment. staying with a trend
that is leading Hollywood away

truthful and as illuminating as
possible. given those set of

ting, but with diversified quality music.

spread appeal of other Chicago
releases.

The group played “Right Before
My Very Eyes,” a beautiful piece
featuring crisp trumpet playing.
The crowd cheered as the group
moved into its 1973 hit “Just You
and Me,” offering enthusiastic
brass, Terry Kath’s rich vocals and
a soprano sax solo. .

Pankow urged the crowd to
participate in “Saturday in the
Park,” and the people obliged.
Seraphine’s drumming carried the
song. Throughout the evening,
when the spotlight was on him,
Seraphine worked hard and fast,
and everyone loved it.

Later the group began playing the
good beat and brass sound of “Docs
Anybody Really Know What Time It

ByTOBIROSEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Hollywood is courting a new
love—the independently produced
duced, shoestring budget ﬁlm.
Adding fuel to this new passion is
Joan Micklin Silver’s “Between
The Lines.”

It now is considered chic to
badmouth “vulgar” entertainment
and cheer “artistic” yawns, and
Micklin’s ﬁlm has all the trade-
marks of the latter.

Her cast is comprised of young,
energetic, appealing unknowns.
She’s captured that new-jour-
nalistic “slice of life” ﬂavor. Her
characters mumble in half-senten-
ces or speak together, propelling
viewers into the action without any
context and creating confusion.

And in all this disarray, viewers
come to know and care about a
group of radical journalists who
have passed through the adoles-
cence of the 60's. They have given
up on ideals in the abstract,
choosing to live on a more practical
level.

Set in present-day Boston,
“Between the Lines” charts the
lives of The Back Bay Mainline staff
as they weave in and out of
committments.

Is?” Chicago’s first hit. The crowd
responded accordingly enjoying the
song and its successor, “Take Me
Back to Chicago.”

Pankow announced the group
was going"to “delve into experi-
mentalish.” It followed with a
strange melody of drums, guitars,
cymbals, congas and ﬂutes, trying
to achieve an Indian sound.

After the “experiment” Kath
used his voice and lead guitar to
highlight the 1976 hit ‘ ‘If You Leave
Me Now.”

The band then thrilled the

audience with the lively uitar an it
3 :92,

heat of “25 or 6 to 4.” The crow
demanded an encore, getting their
wish a few minutes later.

After a short instrumental encore
the concert ended.

 ‘

The group faces a political crisis:
The paper is about to be sold to a
large publishing mogul, a la Village
Voice. The ﬁlm explores just how
far people will risk losing secure
paychecks for the sake of something
larger, more intangible.

Harry, the once-celebrated
investigative reporter, fondly
reminisces about nursing home
scandals. John Heard adds a fresh,
bittersweet edge to Harry. He is
introspective enough to see the

changes, yet powerless to make 

real difference.
Abbie(Lindsay Crouse) ,
Mainline’s photographer, is a
woman who has “found herself”
and is secure enough to take a look
at everyone else. She’s the envy of
the others, who still are wallowing
in the Tom Wolfe "Me” syndrome.
Max(Jeff Goldblum) is resident
rock critic and cynics who doesn’t
care about management or politics
or anything. When he isn't
soliciting handouts, he's proposi-
tioning prospective groupies. Max
is never seen writing in front of his
peers. He exploits his mystique.
The list of staffers also includes
an earth-mother secretary, an

players to explore musical possi-

the solos.

Few bands could fuse such
varied musical elements and carry

it off in an aesthetically and
commercially appealing way. With
Frequent applause after the solos
and two standing ovations that
refused to let the band pack up
until a second encore, there was
little doubt Jean-Luc Ponty and his
band were a hit.

Foghat’s new album, “Foghat

rock’n’ roll lovers.

If you’ve ever had the pleasure of
attending a Foghat concert, you
know the atmosphere is like a big

is guaranteed a good time.

In that respect, Foghat is the last
of a dying bree._ The only band in
recent years capable of creating a
similar atmosphere was Rod

have disbanded.

beaming behind bushy mustaches.

The band’s manner is matched by
its music, hard-charging, basic
blues-rock performed with progres-
sive arrangements. This lets a
crowd work up a sweat, resulting in
a happy physical release for both
band and audience—a classic rock
’n’ roll concert party.

All six songs on the album
embody this happy, good-time rock
’n’ roll spirit. “Fool For the City,”
the title track from Foghat’s 1975
platinum album is the perennial
Foghat concert opener and an apt
choice for this album’s leadoff cut.

In addition, “Fool For the City,”
is the musical prototype for the
simple yet unique talents of this
band. Roger Earl’s deep percussive
beat and Craig MacGregor’s
pulsating bass lines provide the
backbone and kick for the song.
While Lonesome Dave Perverett’s
whining lead vocals and sturdy
rhythm guitar, battle back and forth
with lead guitarist Rod Price’s
growling blues-rock riffs and ﬁlls.

An interesting tribute to Foghat’ s
intensive touring style is the
presence of two road anthems.
Since its inception in 1972, when
Perverett, Earl and original Foghat
bassist Tony Stephens (replaced by
current producer Nick Jameson for
a brief period, and more recently
bassist Craig
MacGregor) left the Kim Simmonds
dominated Savoy Brown, Foghat
has been a hard-working road band.

“Road Fever” and “Home In My
Hand” explain and bring to life this
four-piece band from Britain
unusual love for performing live and
living out of a suitcase for the past

ﬁve years, for as many as 250 days. A

This exhausting and grueling
road pace has provided the catalyst
to certify as gold all of Foghat’s six
studio albums and the new live
album.

It is smart business practice.
Instead of sitting back and waiting
for things to happen, Foghat has
made things happen for themselves
by literally living on the road.

The remaining three songs on the
album, Willie Dixon’s “I Just
Wanna Make Love _ To You,”
“Honey Hush” and the AM hit
“Slow Ride,” are all slam-bang
stuff.

The band revs it up and pulls out
all the stops, clubbing the audience
with an invigoration onslaught of
good-time rock’n’ roll music,
without any unneeded frills or
subtleties.

Foghat never has been afraid of
hard work. Their excellent studio
albums and neverending string of
exciting concert performances
proves that.

“Foghat Live” is the product of
those years of hard work. The music
jumps out of the speakers, showing

,,   Pitt Hopes to Turnover

By RON SIEGEL
Pitt News Staffwriter

GAINESVILLE, Fla.-It rarely
snows in Florida, so it is impossible
even to consider a white Christmas.
But that hasn’t stopped the Florida
Gators from getting into the
Yuletide spirit. The 2-1 Gators
have played Santa Claus every
game so far, turning the ball over
18 times in all.

At a recent booster club meeting
in Orlando, Fla coach Doug Dickey
was given a football with a handle
on it.

This is not to say the Panthers
won’t have their hands full
tomorrow night when they invade
sold-out Florida Field for the
toughest game of the middle of
their schedule.

Florida hasn’t lost a home game
in four years, and 65,000 fans will
be imploring their Gators to keep
that streak alive. Florida leads the
nation in student season tickets
(24,000), and most of these seats
are located directly behind the
visiting team’s bench.

“There is nothing like playing
here,” said all-America wide
receiver Wes Chandler. “We’ve
played a lot of tough games here,
but we haven’t lost one since l’ve
been here.”

4-

 

before bowing to Louisiana State
(LSU) last week. In addition to the
13 fumbles and ﬁve interceptions,
Florida has come up with some
bonehead execution.

In the LSU game, halfback Willie
Wilder started out of the end zone
with a kickoff return, ran to the
two-yard line, then decided to
return to the end zone for a
touchback. Wilder was tackled for
a safety, and he probably now
knows that once you leave the end
zone, you can’t get a touchback.

“We don’t have the answer (to
the turnover problem),” Dickey
said after the LSU game. ‘‘It just
seems to be one of those things
you're snakebitten with. We’ve
had seven guys making the
mistakes. It’s become contagious
with us."

Florida fans (and players, to
some extent) seem to take it for
granted they will win every home
game. They talk about their 12th
man (the student body). and about
how m_u_c_h9f an ed e it gives them.

Fla. Streak

Of course, when the shoe is on
the other foot, things are different.

LSU Stadium, more commonly
known as the Tiger Den, is
considered one of the toughest
ﬁelds in the country for a visiting
team to win at. But Florida
fullback Joe Portale didn’t quite
see things that way.

“I don’t see how anyone can say
that playing on the other guy's ﬁeld
is a handicap,” Portale said, before
LSU’s mauled its way to a 36-14
win. “When the people are booing
you‘or jeering you, that makes the
adrenalin flow. It makes you know
that they're thinking about you.”

The Gators’ loss to LSU probably
cost them a shot at the Southeas-
tern Conference title they’ve never

won. As Pitt is a non-conference
opponent, a letdown would be
natural.

But then again, there’s those
65,000 screaming fans at Florida
Field, who can’t remember the last
time they saw a loss.

The Gators played their ﬁrst
three games on the road, crushing
Rice and edging Mississippi State

GAINESVILLE. Fla.-—Sitting in
the orange and bluelocker room,

u he could easily pass for a manager

or trainer. When he speaks, it is
with the quiet humbleness of a guy
just happy to be on the squad.
Looks can be deceiving.

Wes Chandler is widely consid-
ered as the best receiver in college
football, and he will be
principal offensive player Pitt will
have to contain Saturday if the
Panthers hope to knock off Florida.

Listed 6-1, 188, Chandler ap-
pears much thinner and smaller.
He does not need to do much
talking. His statistics speak for
themselves.

Chandler hauled in 44 passes for
967 yards and 10 touchdowns last

( ,) .ﬁ,§.r, averaging 22 yards per catch.

‘Y.

comparison, Pitt’s Gordon
Jones caught 21 passes for 386
yards and ﬁve touchdowns, an 18.4
yard average.

Chandler is equally proﬁcient on
punt returns. He averaged 13.5
yards per return last year; Jones
averaged 13.7.

“I think Chandler's the best
receiver in the country,” said Gator
head coach Doug Dickey. “He
ranks equally with any collegiate
receiver l’ve seen in getting open
and catching the football, but he is

‘a class by himself once he gets
the ball. I thought he and Tony
Dorsett were the two most exciting,’
dangerous offensive players in the
nation last season.”

To say that Chandler takes this
all in stride is like saying it is going
to be hot here Saturday.

‘‘I’m glad to know he (Dickey)
has got a lot of conﬁdence in me,"
said Chandler.

Since many Pitt fans consider
«Jones the most exciting open ﬁeld
runner around, Saturday's game

rwill naturally be a showdown for

the two.

“I don’t feel any pressure on me
because of that,” said Chandler.

the .

“I got a lot of conﬁdence in our
secondary, which puts him in
trouble.” -

Chandler didn’t even watch the
Pitt-Notre Dame game on televi-
sion, and, especially since the
Panther class is a non-Southeastern
Conference game, it doesn’t really
stand out in his mind.

“The team as a whole is looking
forward to each Saturday,” he
said. “I think we have potential to
make something great happen if we
take one game at a time.”

Florida has never won a
Southeastern Conference title,
though it had it in the bag last
season until it squandered away a
huge lead over Georgia. If the
Gators had won that game, Pitt
would have been faced with the
choice of playing Florida in the
Sugar Bowl or Colorado in the
Orange‘ Bowl. While Pitt contem-
plated national championship pos-
sibilities in its bowl decision last
year, Florida doesn’t even think
about that lofty goal.

The Gators still want that
conference championship, and
Pitt’s being out of the conference
downplays the signiﬁcance of the
game. For the independent
Panthers, every game is important,
and Florida’s ranking makes this
Pitt’s toughest game between the
Notre Dame opener and the Penn
State ﬁnale.

Florida often has proved the old
adage that the game isn’t over until
the ﬁnal buzzer, as the Gators have
won and lost several “wrapped
up” games in recent years.

When the going gets rough. look-
for quarterback Terry LeCount to
seek out Wes Chandler to provide
the spark.

If Gordon Jones could outshine
Chandler, it would greatly enhance
Jones’ all-America chances next
year. Chandler will be graduating
after this season, so there will be
an opening on the squad.

Just as he stepped in for Matt
Cavanaugh, Pitt freshman quarter-
back Rick Trocano may be stepping
out in favor of the senior
quarterback when Pitt meets

   
   

   

After filling in admirably for injured Matt Cavanaugh, freshman quarterback
Rick Trocano is faced with the possibility of sitting the bench in tomorrow
night’s encounter with Florida‘. ’

Field in Gainesville.

But returning to reserve duty
won’t bother Trocano one bit. He
realizes it’s something that’s bound
to happen sooner or later and one
that he's willing to accept.

about. ” Trocano said. “If Matt can
play, he should play. I’m just happy
We’ve been playing well without
Matt out there.”

Cavanaugh, given a clean slate of
health last week after a month-long
layoff with a broken left wrist he

suffered in Pitt’s season opener
against Notre Dame, resumed
contact work in practice this week
and is expected to see action,
perhaps even start, against Florida.

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill
hasn’t announced whether Trocano
or Cavanaugh will start in
tomorrow’s important contest.

“It depends on the way Matt
handles himself in practice,” the
ﬁrst-year coach said during a
mid-week practice session at Pitt
Stadihm. “If Matt can come
through and do things in practice
that we’re planning on doing in the
game, then we certainly hope he can

play. We probably won't know until»

Saturday. ’ ’

In the meantime, both quarter-
backs have been running plays with
the ﬁrst-team offense at practice
this week.

It’s the ﬁrst time in Trocano’s
short college career that he shares
equal billing as the number-one
quarterback.

No matter, the fact that
Cavanaugh is running plays with
the first-team offense hasn’t
affected the freshman from Brook-
lyn, Ohio.

“It’s really nothing,” Trocano
said. “You go through the same
plays, but someone else is going
through them with you, too. You
just have to be ready because you
just don’t know if you're going to
play. You just have to be
prepared.”

That’s something Trocano has
been doing much of lately. He’s
been preparing himself for a
sooner-or-later situation that might
take place tomorrow against Florida
if Cavanaugh returns as Pitt’s
ﬁrst-string quarterback.

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt’s soccer team powered
their way past hapless Gannon
College, 7-1, Wednesday night.
Craig Connely and John O'Hara led
the Panthers by scoring two goals
each while Pitt evened its record at
3-3-1.

It was 1-1 at the half and right

after they scored we had to play with
10 men against their eleven,” Pitt
coach Leo Bemis said. “A lot of
scoring opportunities were missed
in the ﬁrst half and the score could
have been much higher.”
Mark Nigh scored the ﬁrst goal at
1:16 of the ﬁrst half. Gannon tied
the score near the end of the ﬁrst
half, getting as close as they would
the restof the game.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn.—Bedecked
in orange and white from head to
toe, University of Tennessee head
football coach Johnny Majors
obviously is no longer head coach at
Pitt. But there is still a lot of blue
and gold left in the heart of the man
who led the Panthers to a national
championship, and he won’t deny
lt. '

“Mary Elizabeth (Majors’ wife)
and I both miss Pittsburgh a lot,”
Majors said after another disap-
pointing Volunteer practice session.
“I called her today and she said she
was .homesick——for Pittsburgh.

“When I thought about the
Holloways and the Jurys and the
Jeff Delaneys (while debating

Dame game on television last Sept.
10), I felt a togetherness 100 times
more than I have with our own
team.”

Majors’ spacious ofﬁce in the
athletic dormitory training facility is
a striking contrast to the omni-
present orange which pervades the
complex. 7 He has five different
areas in his office for souvenirs. and
momentos-—four of them domina-
ted by Pittsburgh items.

It is not because Majors had his
most success at Pitt, for he was an
equally successful player at Ten-
nessee. He just fell in love with
Pittsburgh, and he is proud of what
he did there, as well as a little said
that he is not still there.

“I had mixed emotions about
turning the TV on (for the Notre
Dame game),” Majors said. “I had
my own game to prepare for that
night, and I didn’t know how it

would affect me. Curiousity ﬁnally

won out, and I turned it on.

whether to watch the Pitt-Notre.

Pitt came on strong in the second
half despite playing one man short.
Connolly started off the scoring only
:58 into the second half and later
added another goal. O’Hara’s ﬁrst
goal came at 14:00 and his second at
27:29. Rich Roccon and Barry Stein
rounded out Pitt’s scoring, notching
goals late in the game. O’Hara, Tim
Pearson, Bob Hughes and Steve
Harrison garnered assists.

It was a good win, “Bemis
stated. “Even though the ﬁeld
conditions were rough, the guys
played well together and we're
looking to stay on the winning
track.”

Concerning Friday's opponent,
Bucknell, Bemis said, “They’re a
good passing ball club and they’ve
been in the Division One playoffs

the last four years. They’re a little
on the young side and their record is
1-2-2.

“In our three wins this year, (all
on the road) we’ve scored 20 goals
to our opponents one. I’d like to
encourage the students to come out
and watch us play. We need that
home crowd support.”

Majors Homesick at Home

Tennessee head coach Johnny Majors, commander of last year’s number-one
champion Pitt Panthers, still misses the team he accomplished so much with.

“Something like that’s not easy to give up,” he said.

. “I really wanted to see them do
well (Pitt lost, 19-9). Something like
that’s not easy to give up.” The
obvious question is: Would Majors
make the switch again if he had the
chance to live the situation over?

That’s a hard question,” he said
with a smile. “I won’t know for a
while——I could second guess myself
either way. If I didn’t choose
Tennessee, I might always have
wondered what it’s like to coach
before a full house every Satur-
day.”

Tennessee ranked third in the
nation in attendance last year, with
an 80,703 average at Neyland
Stadium. Since the coaching jobs at
Ohio State and Michigan weren't
available (they’re the top two
drawing schools), Majors will be
under the scrutiny of as many fans
as he possibly could have this year.
In fact, nearly twice as many people
than Pitt averaged last year will be
watching as Majors gropes his way
through the rugged Southeastern
Conference.

The Tennessee program Majors
took over was not as bad as Pitt’s
was when he arrived here (the Vols
were 6-5 last year, Pitt was 1-10 in
1972). It is just that 6-5 seasons in
Knoxville are as bad as 1-10 seasons
in Pittsburgh. But things are
looking up, especially since Majors
took a 1-10 Pitt team and turned
them into undefeated national
champions in four years.

“I’m optimistic,” he told a pep
club gathering in a meeting room
which featured orange-carpeted
walls. “I wouldn't have left a
national championship team and a
great place to live if I wasn’t."

Wilson photo

But it is going to take time, and
Majors is not hiding that fact.
“How many of you are freshmen

‘and sophomores?” he asked the

group. “I hope you’ll be around to
see us when we’re good.”

with the knowledge they cannot
afford any more losses.

The Panthers, who had three
starters injured at the Bucknell
tournament, will go to Army with
everyone able to play. Butch Silva’s
elbow has healed and Barry Ford
has improved during the week and
should be ready. Mike Mere’s
injured elbow will require surgery
after the season, but he will be
available this weekend if needed.

The tournament is divided into
two three-team brackets. Pitt,
Army and Lehigh are in one division
and NYU, Southern Connecticut
and Bucknell are in the other. The
teams will compete within their own
brackets on Saturday, and the two

Sop

division winners will vie for the
championship Sunday.

The Panthers have not lost a
match in Army’s pool in over two
years, including last year’s Eastern
Championships.

The record each team accumu-
lates in these early tournaments will
not hinder them in qualifying for
either the conference or Eastern
Championships. However, the
NCAA has been known, to select the
team to represent the East on
record, rather than award the bid to
the winner of the Eastems. Such
was the case in 1975, when Bucknell
captured the Eastern Champions-
hips but Army received the NCAA
bid.
