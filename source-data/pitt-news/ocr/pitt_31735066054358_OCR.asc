Cily grants Pill permission to level historic Pennsylvania Hall

In 1908, Pitt held a contest to
find an architect to design its new
campus as the University prepared
to - move to Oakland from

Observatory Hill on the North
Side.

In all, 61 architectural firms
from around the country respond-

ed. Their goal was to design a cam-
pus of 30 buildings on top of the
hill where Pitt Stadium and the
Veterans’ Hospital now stand, and
an underground elevator to shuttle
students up from and down to
O’Hara Street. .

Pitt chose the plan submitted
by Henry Hornbostel, a Brooklyn
native turned Pittsburgh resident.

fallen into dire financial straits,
and only five of Hornbostel’s
buildings were ever built. Today
only ‘three remain: the Mineral
Industries Building, Thaw Hall and
Pennsylvania Hall. '
And for the last several years
Pitt has been planning to tear down
Pennsylvania Hall to build a park-

. Shepherd’: Heart

Ramesh Reddy

Mike Wurschmidt; his wife,
Tina; and their 1 1/2-year-old

daughter, Christen, were forced to
stand in line for food during the
eight weeks they spent homeless
after loosing their computer busi-

ness in Denver.

“Standing in food lines, totally
dependent on others,_ God broke my

heart to the homeless,” Wurschmidt

said. A

church serves more than 200 home-
less people between Oakland and
Downtown. V

“We do Friday night outreaches,
bringing food out on the streets, giv-
ing blankets and clothes by being a

ministryof presence, showing up ‘

every week establishing relation-
ship(s) with ,(the)_ homeless in
Oakland,” Wurschmidt said.
Oakland is a prime area to
encounter the homeless he wants to
help, Wurshmidt added.

out to the panhandlers, homeless

“Many (homeless people), in
fact, have beat their addictions and

-have become employed in various

capacities,” Chester said. “This all
has led to a dramatic decrease in
crime by the homeless people who
have accepted the help that
Shepherd’s Heart ministry is willing‘
and capable of giving.” —
Anne Bernardi, a Spanish
teacher for the Pittsburgh public
schools and a Shepherd’s Heart
member, feels many organizations.
she was a part of in the past were

‘reaching out to the smartest and

brightest but ignoring others a. in
need. _ ., ‘

“Jesus hung out with homeless
people, poor, ungodly, sick, unlove-
ly,” she’ said. “‘I realized churches
were not doing t-hat. I felt God called.
me to reach out.”_

‘Wurschmidt said dealing with
anybody who needs help is a prima-
ry goal ofhis ministry.

“People know they can come
exactly the way they are: filthy,
smelly, drunk,” he said. “We must
embrace ' them and love them
because that’s what Jesus did for us.
For so long, churches ‘have left the
inner cities for the more comfortable

Suburbs, and the Lord is wanting the
church to come back to the city.”

’ Kyle Gebhart, a senior religious
studies and English writing major at
Pitt, works at Shepherd’s Heart and
emphasized. the need to accept peo-

' ple as they are in order to help them.

“The issue’ is not just homeless-
ness but that homelessness is also a
symptom of addiction,” Gebhart
said. “And the only effective means
of dealing with addiction is for peo-
ple’s hearts to change. The way that
happens is to bring them into a fam-
ily, embracing them unconditional-

ly.” ' .
An example of the ministry’s
success is Mike Tartaglione, who
said he was molested when he was 7
years old and became an angry, mis-
trusting person who never realized
he had any‘ potential for success.
Withthe help of Shepherd’s Heart,
Tartaglione has attended school and
gotten a fresh start on life.

“One of the major diseases
homeless people have is low self-
esteem,” said Tartaglione. “Jesus
Christ helped me realize low self-
esteem does not belong in me. I’ll
tell you what, it was a long battle
through pain.” _

3 Hal Turner

Edltor n Chlef

An incoming Pitt grad‘ student
fell to. his death last week, jumping
from-his Tower B dorm room.

Joachim Futterer, who was to
start his graduate work in Pitt’s
German department this fall,
dropped 20 stories from. his dorm
room window early Aug. 22. The
Allegheny County coroner’s office
ruled the death a suicide that day.
Futterer was 26. ’

He had just returned a few days
earlier from visiting his ill father in
Germany, according to Pitt senior

Adam Schaible.‘ Futterer was think-
ing of sharing an ‘apartment in
Squirrel Hill with Schaible and his
roommate, Dale Hinote, a graduate
student at Pitt.

“It’s a shame because he seemed
like a nice guy,” Schaible said.

Hinote showed Futterer most of
the apartment when he came to see it.

“He seemed a little bit nervous
and distracted,” Hinote said. But
both Hinote and Schaible said they
attributed Futterer’s demeanor to
worry about his father’s health and
fear of living with total strangers in a
strange country.

Clark Muenzer, chairman of the

German department, said Futterer
had been doing all the things new
students do to settle in, like opening
a bank account and attending ’orien-
tation sessions. He was even looking
for a band that could use his guitar-
playing skills, Muenzer said.

“It came out of the blue,” he said.
“It’s a sad event, and tragic.”

Futterer was the third person to
jump to his death at Pitt in the last 2
1-2 years. In March 1996, an under-
graduate jumped from the 35th ﬂoor
of the Cathedral of Learning over
spring break. Three months later, a
Pitt grad jumped from the 32nd ﬂoor
of the Cathedral. ’

PA HALL

ing garage and tennis courts.
Local community groups and
preservation societies have lob-
bied the city to prohibit Pitt’s
plan. Now the fight is over.

On July 28, the City Planning
Commission voted 6-1 to let Pitt
tear down Pennsylvania Hall and
to build a 64—car subterranean
parking garage covered by three
tennis courts on the site.

Preservation activists said
they will not continue to fight.

“If they want to be barbarians,
let them be barbarians,” said John
Murdoch of Pitt administration.
Murdoch, a member of
‘Preservation Pittsburgh, thinks
Pennsylvania Hall should be
saved for its architectural signifi-
cance.

Pitt has allocated $420,000 for
Pennsylvania Hall’s demolition in
this year’s capital budget. The
administration has also set aside
almost $1.5 million to build the
parking garage and tennis courts.

“I’m not going to waste my

*time and money fighting this,”

Murdoch said. Pitt administrators,
he said, are a “gaggle of clerks
with exulted titles” who are isolat-
ed from the concerns of students,
faculty and community members.

Vice Provost Robert Pack said
keeping community members’
needs in mind is a goal the
University takes seriously.

“The University can thrive
only if the communities surround-
ing it thrive,” Pack said.

He added that Pitt strives for
an open dialogue with its neigh-
bors. Discussion of tentative pro-
jects is an integral part of Pitt’s
master plan of what buildings it
needs to erect. Beyond the archi-
tectural loss, Murdoch said his
biggest objection to demolishing
Pennsylvania Hall is the waste of
an existing building.

. “I can’t believe that some use
can’t be put to that [building],” he
said. “I think things can be used
and reused.” . -

It is a sentiment echoed by
many community members who
think Pitt should use Pennsylvania
Hall for student housing rather
than spreading out into Oakland to
find space.

“Pitt really should be putting
most of its housing on campus,”

I said Helen Schlenke, a member of

the Bellefield Area Citizens
Association. “The undergraduate
lifestyle doesn’t match the
lifestyle of older people who live
in the [area].”

Pitt says converting
Pennsylvania Hall for any use just
isn't possible.

FROM PAGE 1

“Pennsylvania Hall is the kind
of building that’, because it was
designed so long ago, makes it
difficult to redesign it and use it
for something else,” Ana Guzman,
associate vice chancellor of facili-
ties management, told the plan-
ning commission,

She said the, building also has
structural problems, such as
cracking walls.

“It’s a building that’s gone
through its useful life,” she said.

Construction of Pennsylvania
Hall began in 1910. Hornbostel —
who had earlier designed Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall, the
City—County Building downtown,

Do THE

and a large part ‘of Carnegie
Me1lon’s campus —— designed
Pennsylvania Hall in the classical
style. He included a wide double
staircase and, since the building
was going to be Pitt’s medical
school, a sculpture of the Roman
god of medicine, Aesculapius. In
granting Pitt permission to demol-
ish the building, the planning
commission mandated that the
University preserve the statue.
The University had said it
wanted to demolish Pennsylvania
Hall before the start of the fall
football season. But at this point
‘there is no firm time line, accord-
ing to John Sopcisak, director of
planning, design and construction.
Pitt doesn’t even have an architect
to design the new garage, he said.

honor should plan their curricula during their early
undergraduate years so as to meet the requirements for
membership. ‘ A ’

Ten more arrested for State College
riot, one student sues police

Rachel Hanson

Dally Collegian
(U-WIRE) STATE COLLEGE,
Penn. —— Ten more arrests have been

made in connection with the July 12
riot, said State College Police Chief
Tom King Thursday at a press confer-
ence. ‘

Of the 10 new’ arrests, eight indi-
viduals were arraigned following the
press conference. Five of those facing
charges are Penn State students.

One is an alumnus, one a local resident
and one a local high school student.

Throughout yesterday’s confer-
ence, King remained ﬁrm in his belief
the riot was fueled by excessive alco-
hol consumption.

King also dismissed what some
have said was an extenuating circum-
stance — police not arriving at the
scene promptly enough to stop the riot.

“The only ﬁngers that should be
pointed are at those who participated in
the riot,” King said.

Options for addressing the problem
of underage drinking off campus
include police randomly carding peo-
ple at large parties and using undercov-
er operations, he added.

“The next person you offer a drink .

to may be working for us,” King said.

State College Mayor Bill Welch
said at the conference the community
has an alcohol problem, not an educa-
tion problem.

He said the prevalence of underage
drinking and alcohol abuse in fraterni-
ties and apartment buildings is a prob-
lem the entire community must work
together to solve.

King and Welch emphasized Penn
State has a history of expelling those
students convicted of felony offenses
such as rioting.

And they added procedure will
remain the same.

The other two people arrested had
charges- of failure to disperse ﬁled
against them dismissed at their prelim-

inary hearings in July.

Both men were 21-year-old Penn
State students.

Kevin F. Lang, of East Norwich,
N.Y., who was arrested at the riot, had
the charge of failure to disperse dis-
missed at his second preliminary hear-
ing Wednesday.

The charge was reﬁled after being
dismissed at his first preliminary hear-
ing, during which the charge of disor-
derly conduct was bound over for trial.

In addition to giving the details of
recent arrests, King also extended
thanks to individuals who tried to pre-
vent further damage at the riot.

Of the people he thanked, King '

said there was one unidentiﬁed woman
who was seen on videotape trying to
pull items from a ﬁre. before she was
assaulted by rioters.

“Her efforts were very heroic. 
We still don’t know the identiﬁcation
of that woman,” King said.

As a result of the riot, all Centre
County police departments are receiv-
ing additional training on crowd con-
trol, and some departments are getting
new equipment for riots.

The new arrests were made with
the help of videotapes, pictures posted
on a World Wide Web site, and one per-
son who turned himself in after seeing
his photograph in the newspaper.

King also said although the use of
the Web site to identify. suspects was
new, it most likely will be used in the
future. -

“The (Web site) is an up-and-com-
ing investigative tool,” King said.

King also commented on other
issues, such as the civil suit being ﬁled
against police by a Penn State student.

No rioters had any physical
injuries as a result of the arrests, King
said.

Therefore, he said the civil suit
being ﬁled against his department is
not based on actual events.

The suit, however, alleges police
brutality. , ‘

The Pitt-West Virginia foot-
ball game (the “Backyard
Brawl”) on Nov. 27 will be
played at Three Rivers Stadium,
as opposed to Pitt’s actual back-
yard. L

Contrary to the concerns of
local business owners who
signed a petition addressed to
Athletics Director Steve
Pederson, this one home game
played at a venue other than Pitt
Stadium is good for both Pitt
and the Oakland community.

There are many reasons

. why this. is a great idea:

- Luxury boxes, which Pitt
Stadium does not have.
Corporations purchase these
boxes, and there are many com-
panies from which the athletics
department could solicit dona-
tions. . -
- Recruiting. Many recruits
will be visiting while»they’re on
Thanksgiving vacation. The
idea of playing in a stadium
such as Three Rivers could
mean a lot for a prospective
football player.

0 Television. At televised
games, only the two lower sec-
tions in the stadium are shown.
Even if Pitt goes into this game
0-10 and home support has
dwindled, it would not take

_;_EnIIrm

kyarcl Brawl at Three
Rivers Stadium best for Pitt

the prospect of driving and

.a short-term sacrifice with

much to fill these sections.
Even with a crowd of around
25,000,_ Three Rivers Stadium
would still appear pretty crowd-
ed. -
- Fans. Students, especially
those non-manic fans who do
not go home for Thanksgiving
break, may be attracted to a
game at Three Rivers. Many
fans (especially alumni and
WVU fans) are intimidated by

parking in Oakland. Three
Rivers, which is right off of I-
279, is easily accessible.

0 The game itself. If the
Backyard Brawl is anywhere
near as exciting as'last year’s,
the game will attract more fans
for the fall ‘99 season. This will
bring more fansto Oakland and '
more revenue for local busi-
nesses. ,

The temporary relocation is

long-term gains. At least the
athletics department did not
move the Sept. 19 game against
Penn State. As long as moving
games to a major stadium does
not become a habit, there
should be nothing to fear.

If it helps improve the team,
it will help improve Oakland
and‘Pitt.'

hm. CI-WON . ,

Last fall, historian Stephen Ambrose pub-
lished “Citizen Soldiers,” his opus on the young
soldiers who left their homes in small-town
America to journey to Europe and ﬁght against
the German army. Ambrose, who provided
extensive advice to Steven Spielberg for his
masterpiece “Saving Private Ryan,” chronicled
in his book ﬂre story of the amazing World War
II generation. From the beaches of Normandy to
the snows of Germany, from the jungles of
Guadalcanal and Burma to the sands of Iwo
Jinra and Okinawa, American boys (some as
young as 18 or 19) served their country in some
of the most inhuman conditions imaginable.

Meanwhile, on the home front, Americans
worked around the clock to produce goods for
the war effort. Ambrose writes: “The we gener-
ation of World War II . . . was a special breed of
men and women who did great things for
America and the world” _

In the 19603, John F. Kennedy, the ﬁrst
president of the World War II gener-
ation, was widely admired when he
made his call forAme1ica’s youth —
the so-called Baby Boomers — to.
serve their country abroad in the
Peace Corps or domestically by

helping people in underdeveloped places get

medical care and education. Millions, inspired
by the example of their fathers and mothers,
heeded JFK’s call and enlisted in the Peace
Corps or moved to Appalachia to help the poor.

I admire those who lived through World

War II. They liberated the world from tyranny in ’

the 1940s and built America into a superpower
during the 1950s. I admire those who worked
for social progress during the 1960s. Here in
America, their work for civil rights corrected the
most egregious wrongs of our society. Abroad,
they helped export to the world the American
ideals of peace and democracy to the world.
These two generations did much, and will be
remembered for their work for decades (if not
centuries) to come.

And so, my fellow college students of the

19903, What is our monument? What is our
. endowment to future generations? The answer

is, We don’t have one, and we aren’t likely to
have one either.

Today JFK’s legacy of sacriﬁce and service
is nearly forgotten by most 20-somethings,
replaced by endlessly dim—wit1ed speculation
about whether or not he had an alfair with
Marilyn Momoe. Generation Xers have an
abysmal voter-tmnout record. Study after study
shows that 20-somethings are not only unin-

law Strum:
Generation X: pathetic & lame

formed and uninterested in politics, they don’t
see any point in changing their ways. It is a sad
commentary that the big cause of this generation
is not defending the rights of the underprivi-

leged, but defending the right to drink on cam-

pus. In May, for example, a riot gripped the cam-
pus at Michigan State when 3,000 students took
to the streets, setting bonﬁres and pelting police
oﬂicers with rocks to protest a ban on kegs at
tailgate parties. A

I ﬁnd this all very disappointing and disillu-
sioning. America stands at the apex of its power
in the world. It is doubtful that there ever was a
generation that was as aﬂluent or as privileged
as ours. And how do we honor the sacriﬁces
made by those‘ who came before us? By carry-
ing on their work? By chugging a few beers and
whining about how bad we have it.

When I listen to my elders complain about
“kids today,” I wonder if they have a point. Did
our grandparents defeat Hitler so we could_play
Sega? Did our parents work for
social justice so we could sit in front
of -the television and giggle at the
infantile humor of “South Park”? Is
college about discovering who you
are? Acknowledging that as part of a
privileged elite we have a duty to give some-
thing back? Or have our parents sent us here to
drink, party and waste away time before we
have to enter the real world and get a real
Monday-to—Fn'day, 9-to-5 job? '

My disappointment is also the lost opportu-
nity of it all. If 20-somethings ever‘ woke up
from their alcohol-induced hangovers they
could become a potent political force, easily the
equal of organized labor or the religious right.
Instead of complaining about how underrepre-
sented they are in politics, perhaps‘ 20-some-
things might want to exercise their right to,Vote
for a change. Apathy is the death of democracy.
If we pass along our apathy to our children,
democracy in the United States may very well
wither and die. . I

Inthe end, Iwonder if the sacriﬁces of those
who came before us were worth it. Did two gen-
erations struggle against terrible evils to realize
theAmericandream, onlyto seetheir successors
throw it all away simply because they didn’t
care anymore? Perhaps, in the ﬁnal analysis, that
shall be our legacy. Ruining the American
dreambecauseweweretoolazytogiveadamrr
Somehow, I doubt anyone will thank us.

butts and get moving.

Advice on how to alleviate boredom cit Piﬂ

Rehan Nasir
Columnlst

As the kids say, “Welcome back to
Pitt.”

For some odd personal reason, I also
return to the lovely little educational oasis
that is Oakland. I’m-even living in the
same chamber, er, dorm.

However, I’m writing this for all of
you fresh out of high school and fresh
into college. Many of you have the poten-
tial of a box of crayons, and it is necessary
to harness such gifts.

As most of you have been told by
counselors, teachers, peers, brokers and
nosy bank tellers, college is vastly differ-
ent from high school. In this column, I
hope to address the major problems that
many of you will face acclimating your-
selves to Pitt life.

First, we have Roommate Problems.
You may have experienced this over the
summer with that fun telephone exchange
(you know the one):

You: Hi, my name is , and I’m
going to be your roommate this year, and
I was wondering  .

Him: Oh, hey, great, I was thinking of
turning the whole room into a bed of hot
coals and having a barbecue going 24/7

Interestingly enough, a bed of “hot
coals” would be legal at Pitt if not for
those nasty grease ﬂare-ups.

' You may also suffer ﬁom Roommate
Jealousy/Envy. In this case, you and
Roommate have one big difference: He

has a life, and you don’t. All ,-
the phone calls are for him,
and you usually end up .7};
with a good bit of his misdi-  ‘
rected voice mail. \‘-~

The best solution for this, X
of course, would be to
respond in a most
wicked manner to those
on your voice mail. He’d
lose a few friends and
maybe make some time
to teach you how to be
“cool.” ,

Most of the time,
there is something fim "to

now? Heck no. Time to start the
assembly process ’ all over again.
Hello, graduate school?

Another problem that you may have
to deal with is the elevators on campus.
Again, there are two simple solutions:

1. Don’t. Try to remember that the
last meal you had was entirely fried
in 10W-30, and, well, that just can’t
be good for you or your arteries.

2. This has nothing to do with
faulty elevators, and I shall now
relinquish myself of any responsi-
bility if someone should actually
.,, do this: You could always ﬁnd

Well,’ for gosh sakes, join the 'fim!
You’re only a freshman now, but it’s high
time you start thinking about that resume
and building it up from whatever may be
lying about. ‘

Before you say, “Wait a minute, I’m
too busy studying,” remember high
school and all the useless activities you
pursued? Well, do they mean anything

a great story to tell over
Thanksgiving.

Last, the following predicaments
may arise from your classes:

1. Setup of the classroom. This may
mess with your inner “vibe,” thus creat-
ing a learning disturbance that may be
difficult to overcome. A simple solution
for this: large quantities of chocolate

syrup. You could, of course, accessorize
(milk, ice cream, Oreos), but straight
syrup is quite therapeutic.

2. Armoying people behind you, talk-
ing about some show on the WB. I’ve
always found that following these people
after class and taking grainy 8xl0s is both
relaxing and fim. After some research
(this may require you to take off for a few
days) send the photos to them, complete
with a ransom—style message, indicating
swift punishment for crimes against the
“tranquility of alearning capsule.” Enjoy
the silence.

3. Gum under the desks. Yes, this
problem still has a strong presence in col-
lege, despite claims of higher intellect.
Probably the most disgusting thing to do
is to actually look at the offensive gum.
This sight is similar to that of many,
“gooey and slimy” creatures gestating,
preparing to attack the general populace.
What is the solution then? Put those class
handouts to use and cover the nauseating

oral refuse. ‘ ,

So there you have it. Tips and sug-
gestions. Pointers and advice. Do’s and
Do Not’s. Remember this: Even though
you may have left Wiggins theWonder
Dog at home, you’ll make friends here.
They may have the vigor of dead ﬂowers
and the complexity of a pencil, but at least
they’re a group to call your own. And to
call you to tell you your ﬁnals schedule.

Rehan Nasir wonders if shouting at trees
is a good way to prepare for an audition.

Kramer

As we attempt to excrete our brain
juices for yet another year at this pro-
gressively awesome university, it is
time once again to reﬂect upon some of
the more serious issues that beg to ques-
tion our intellectual ability.

Aside from the facts that Mark
McGwire is kicking ass, that Pearl Jam
kicked ass, that there is definitely
Something about Mary, and that Bill
Clinton has maintained his poise as a
pervert, the real leaders of this country
have once again declared war!

This time there’s a fatal twist: It’s
not a war on drugs, a war on poverty, or
a war on crime. It’s a war on terrorism.
And you know what? It’s real, it’s hap-
pening, and it’s pretty darrmed scary!

Justifiably so, President Clinton, on
Aug. 20, OK’d the annihilation of two
strategic terrorist facilities in Sudan and
Afghanistan. These areas were alleged-
ly linked to Osamabin Laden’s military
terrorist regime, which the American
public has been led to believe was

responsible for the simultaneous
American embassy bombings in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. ‘

Whoever and Whatever you believe,
if in fact it is anyone or anything at all,
it’s time to prepare yourself. Not to
Rage Against the Machine, but rather
for what Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called “the unfortunate war of
the future.” “

Because Albright failed to -Cl6flIl6
what we should expect out of this “war
of the future,” one can only guess what
the Pentagon has in store for the few
and the proud. It’s easy to imagine that
the “war of the future” will mimic the
kinds of illusive destruction one would
hope to be a product of only
Hollywood. However, nuclear threats,
bombs, chemical weapons, hostage sit-
uations and the like appear to be on the
brink. ‘

All joking aside, it now is and will
continue to be one of the more frighten-
ing periods in American history. The
major players in this war have predicted
a continuous exchange of blows
between our military and those of a ter-

gonna call, William

rorist nature.

The justiﬁcation for this style of
diplomacy appears to be deterrence.
Both Defense Secretary William Cohen
and President Clinton have reiterated
that the security of our nation and our
way‘ of life will only continue to be
jeopardized if we fail to take action.

Inaction, they noted, would only spawn .

more violence in the future.

Hopefully, this battle will not con-
tinue to a point where we fail to recog-
nize whether the ends justified the
means, the means - justified the ends, or
what the.hel1 the means or the ends
were in the first place.

Those of us at home on- the Pitt
campus, however, can risk living rela-
tively carefree, despite the notion that
many of us care for someone who is or
will be an international traveler. In
some sick, despicable and downright
evil way, the ones we love are possible
targets. Targets because they are
Americans. This means that intema—
tional travelling again needs to be taken

‘a bit more seriously than usual.

It is reasonably safe to assume
groups like bin Laden’s wouldn’t dare

Cohen?-

strike on the soil of a country with a rel-
atively sufficient  coupled with
decent diplomatic relations with the
United States. The last thing terrorist

groups like bin Laden’s want is a united ‘

international coalition ﬁghting against
them. A reality such as this would only
accelerate their suicide.

But one carmot dismiss the fact that '

these people are resourceful madmen.
That they believe to .the ultimate in
what they’re doing and will stop at
nothing to make their point to the
world. And any American, whether
ignorant or knowledgeable of the

_United States’ manipulation of the

Middle East, will only be a’ reminder of
what they’ve lived to hate. I

Anyway, it’s time .for our genera— ,

tion to closely monitor the ramiﬁcations
of our country’s future military deci-
sions. They need to be reckoned with.
In five years, the bloodshed may have
reached its limit, and this war may need
to be stopped. And who ya gonna call,
William Cohen?

Julian Graham-
more than just a
football . player

By now, most of you gentle readers
have already been to class.

Summer has ofﬁcially ended. Dreams
of cross—country road trips, days of lying
on the beach, and countless hours behind
the retail desk at the shoe department of
Bloomingdale’s come to a close in the
shadow of Intro to Neuropsychology.

Everyone spends summer differently.

Julian Graham, Pitt Panther defensive
lineman, spent his summer working.

For much of it, he attended summer
football conditioning at Pitt Stadium,
where Buddy Morris, football ﬁtness
gum/tyrant, had players move dump
trucks, run upbleachers and haul cinder
blocks. ’

Then, as a reward for completing
these “voluntary” drills (voluntary in the
sense that breathing is voluntary),
Graham and teammates traveled to
Johnstown for more than a week of
mandatory torture. .

Three practices a day. Meetings and
weightlifting in between practices. Daily
chewing-out sessions at the hands of Bob
Junko and Tom Freeman — two assistant
coaches with voices that would make a
Megadeth roadie reach for earplugs.

Most players trudged into the cafete-

ria for dinner after the third practice, taped ,

beyond recognition and limping on both
legs. They stumbled through the carbohy-
drate-laden delicacies, then slowly sat at
their tables, watching “SportsCenter” and

clearing their minds for the evening’s v

meetings.

Graham was one of few exceptions.
He didn’t trudge. Hewasn’t taped. He did
watch “Spo1tsCenter,” but can you blam
him? '

The redshirt junior stayed upbeat,
even during interviews that cut into pre-
cious down time.

During our interview, Graham spoke

about leadership, dedication and pride in ‘

his team. About winning games for
seniors instead of for himself. He spoke
about commitment, attitude and every-
thing else that made the 1997 Panthers a
feel-good success story and could make
the 1998 Panthers the same.

He “spoke” about these things; he
didn’t “talk” about them, like most play-
ers. There were no cliches, no “taking his
game to the next level” or “playing one
day at a time” or “giving it 110 percent.”

How he could have maintained the
ability to converse after being put through
the drills he was put through astounds me.

On a sizzling hot day at football
camp in J ohnstown, the team had just
finished 25 minutes of grueling
sprints that capped the ,day’s third and
final practice.

In the middle of the ﬁeld, the
group of about 100 exhausted players
gathered around their leader, head
coach Walt Harris, and listened atten-
tively as he talked about sacriﬁce,
commitment and the price you have
to pay to be a winner.

After he ﬁnished, Harris asked if
anybody on the team had anything to
add. Then, out of the collection of
weary young men, emerged Matt
Lytle. ' . .

All cars were locked on the senior
quarterback, who delivered a serious
but energetic address to his team.

“I told them a little story about

Lytle said. '

The learning .. experience Lytle

Out of the spotlight, Lytle
watched from the sideline as his for-

mer backup, Pete Gonzalez, shattered

Big East passing records while lead-
ing the Panthers to a dramatic and
very unexpected Liberty Bowlberth.

“He had to eat some humble pie

last year,”‘ said Harris of Lytle. “He

was a starter; then he wasn’t a starter.
He rode the sidelines last year, but to
his credit, he learned a lot:

“He could have sat on the side-
lines with his head up his butt, but he

Lytle’s enthusiasm was never
more evident than in Pitt’s amazing

-triple-overtime win in West Virginia.

When Gonzalez threw the win-
ning touchdown to Terry Murphy and
sent Pitt into the postseason, Lytle
threw his hands into the air and

leaped high off the ground. He then.

raced down the sideline to congratu-
late Pete and celebrate with his team-
mates.

Lytle’s reaction to that play is
typical of the attitude he took all of
last season. He. could have been smug
and bitter about losing his job, but he
wasn’t. _

Instead, he learned from what
Gonzalez did, coming from nowhere
to develop into an NFL—caliber quar-

Defense looks to lead Panthers this year

Kevin Lilley
Senlor Football Wrlter

Bob Junko has yelled himself hoarse.
Or so you’d think.

Every practice for 12 days at
J ohnstown, J unko barked at the defensive
line for lack of hustle, lack of intensity, or
any of a number of other reasons.

Afterward, at the lunch table, in
interviews or in meetings, Junko’s voice
barely made ityout of his mouth.

But by the next practice, he was on
top of every miscue.
“You get tired, and they get tired of

Graham, “so it’s up to us to impress
them.”

Impressing the defensive coaching
staff has been a tough assignment; very
rarely did the yelling from Junko or
defensive coordinator Larry Coyer die

down. But the screams may be necessary '

when dealing with. such a young group of
players — the defense returns 16 letter-
men but only a handful of starters.
Graham and senior Marlin Young are
the only two returnees on the defensive
line, with Young slated to start at one end
and Graham set to battle, veteran backup
Ken Kashubara for the other post. Boston
' ' Pete? Simonian, who

  
 

was slated to start ahead of Younggoing
into camp, went down with a knee injury
and missed the end of summer workouts.

Junko — he of the raspy voice —
was also impressed with Brandon
Dewey, a recruit from West Allegheny
High School who played both end and
tackle in Johnstown drills.

“Dewey is a hard worker,” the defen-
sive line coach said. “He has quickness,
and he’s just [about] good, hard wor .”

The good, hard work may pay off
with playing time at defensive tackle,

Offense looks to adjust
quicklyto many new faces

Patrick Robertson

Sports Editor

The Pitt West Coast-style offense
lost six starters and thus returns only ﬁve
from last season’s unit, which was the most
productive offense in years. ‘

Last year, quarterback Pete Gonzalez
threw 30 touchdown passes for a Big East
record, and receiver Terry Murphy also set a
Big East record with 13 touchdown catches.
The two helped make last year’s" offense the
top passing attack in the Big East.

The offense also lost great linemen in

- John Marzoch, Tony Orlandini, and Reggie

Thomas. These three linemen had more than
100 collegiate starts among them.

The new faces may have trouble grasp-
ing the West Coast offense that has been so
elusive to so many professional and college
players over the years.

In the backﬁeld, Pitt lost the strong one-
two punch of Dwayne Schulters and Billy
West West was the Big East Offensive

_ Player of the Year in 1994 before breaking

his leg in the second game of the 1995 sea-
son. These backs shared the load -for the lat-
ter portion of last year.

Receiver Jake Hoffart also left after a

spectacular year at wide receiver. He set a

Big East record with 64 receptions last year.

The offense has lost a great deal of
depth and talent, but it may be able to ﬁll in
the holes this year.

“Look at where we were last year at this
time and where we are now — not that far
apart,” offensive coordinator Steve
Mooshagian said “You can’t judge the
offense before we play a few games. '

“We are young and inexperienced,”
Mooshagian said, “but there are some talent-
ed kids out there, and if we gel and come
together, the sky is the limit.”

To begin to ﬁll the holes, the Panthers
ﬁrst must look to their ﬁfth-year senior quar-

R terback, Matt Lytle. He started in 1996 but

then lost the job to‘Gonzalez last year.

Lytle is a very strong left-handed quar- T

terback who can lower his shoulder and pick
up a ﬁrst down ifnecessary. He has started
11 gamesinhiscareerandwillprobablybe
able to help bring some leadership to the
Pittsburgh offense. ‘

“Lytle has deﬁnitely stepped up. I think
he understands the oﬁense more since he has
had ayearto watch fromthe sideline. He has
seen what Coach Hanis likes,” Mmphy said

The nmning back situation is a little
more muddled for the Panthers. Sophomore
Kevan Barlow comes in as the veteran of the

' group, having played in seven games. last

year.

Recruits Brandon Williams and Isaac
Williams probably will compete for and see
time at tailback since the fourth man, Amir
Dew, dropped out ofthe race with an injury.

“I think all three could play. Schulters,
West and Barlow all played last year, and we
could have the same situation,” Mooshagian
said.

Thefullbackraeeisjustastight, with

redshirt freshman Rickey Mendenhall bat-
tling with last year’s tandem of Chris
Schneider and Tony Thompson.

Murphy comes off his reo0rd—setting
year to lead a strong group of Panther
receivers. He will be the go—to guy, but many
others will contribute.

Murphy may miss the ﬁrst game or two
with an injured shoulder, so the team will see
very quickly what the new receivers can do.

“We have six kids competing, and you .

probably will not see Murphy every down,”
Mooshagian said i I

Jackie Womack runs a 4.5—second 40-
yard dash, but his speed on the ﬁeld is much
quicker. He sat out last year after transferring
from Mississippi Delta Community College
and learned the offense during that time. His
speed should help him break away from
many defenders.

R.J. English, Iatef Grim, Julius Dixon
and Kenny Ketchen will look to ﬁll the other
spaces on the depth chart '

Juan Williams started last year but will
make few if any appearances this year
because he injured his knee during summer
workouts. Converted guard Ben Kopp,
whom the coaching staff likes as a run block-
er, and Kirk McMullen, who played a little
last year, both conre in to add depth when
coachWaltHam'sdecidestogotoatwo-
tight-end set. \

The offensive line has little depth with

I only 14 linemen; many large programs can

have up to 40.
Andrew Grischow returns for his third
season at center. He will be expected to help
many of the young recruits adjust to the
offense and learn their positions quickly.
Ethan Weidle probably will step in as a

returning starter at right guard and help

Grischow anchor the line. Weidle missed
some time during camp due to an operation

on his sinuses but should be ready for. the A

start of the season. _

.. Ryan Hansen and ﬁfth-year senior
Jason Dugger will battle for the righttackle
spot. Hansen is entering his ﬁrst year of eli-
gibility at Pitt after transferring from
Bakersﬁeld College, and Dugger has come
to camp with a newfound intensity. '

Ieftguardprobablywillbeabattle
between Jeff McCurley and Mike Bosnic.

McC1rrley started last year, but the redshirt I

sophomore Bosnic should give him .a big
push for the starting spot.

The left tackle likely will be a battle
between junior transfer Mark Browne, fresh-
man Khiawatha Downey and freshman" Joe
Manganello. ' V

“As long as I keep doing the plays right

andplayinghard, Ithinkl willkeepmy start-E’
, ing position,” Browne said

Manganello, a 6—foot-4-inch, 285-
pound graduate of nearby Plum High

Special Teamers Iook

Brian Knavish

Asst. Sports Editor
Ahhh, the life of a kicker. You

_get to say you’re on the football

team and’wear that treasured.uni-
form, but you don’t get hit, you
don’t have to lift, and you don’t
have to run. Heck, you can just
screw around and kick a couple
balls during practice.

Maybe at a lot of places, but
that’s not the life of a kicker at Pitt.
Everyone on the team, kickers and

punters included, has to endure the _

same hell of practice and condition-
ing. Everyone runs the endless sets
of sprints and carries cinder blocks

up and down the stadium stairs.

“You’re part of the team; you
have to pay the same dues as every-
one else,” said senior place—kicker
Chris Ferencik. “A kicker gets more
respect from his teammates that
way’?

Coaches realize that many many
football games are won or lost on
field goals. That’s why Ferencik
and company spend most of prac-

tice kicking and punting, perfecting

their craft.

In fact, special teams as a
whole get a lot of attention from the
Pitt coaching staff. At summer

- campin Johnstown, a big portion of

the day’s third and final practice

was devoted to special teams.

Coaches critiqued punting,
kickoff and field goal formations
and execution. Then the players
went through live special teams
drills before the team split into its
usual offensive and defensive units.

Then, when practice is over, the
kickers lined up with the rest of the
team for 20 minutes or so of
exhausting sprints.
_ Ferencik, who is recovering
well from off-season surgery that
removed part of a disk_from his
back, will handle the all-important
field-goal duties.

consistent [as in the past], and other

to make impact this season

guys at other positions had to pick
up the slack,” Ferencik said of his
1997 season when he made 6 of 9
field goals and 32 of 38 extra
points. “My goals for this year are
to keep my back healthy and be
more consistent to help‘ the team
more.”

Sophomore Paul Ruzilla will
handle kickoff duties and back up
Ferencik on field goal attempts.

The Panthers brought in junior
college transfer Greg DeBolt to
helpstrengthen the team’s punting
game. He appears to have a slight
edge over senior punter Kevin
Bever. '

Pitt’s return game looks solid
this year-with junior Hank Poteat

. slated to return most kickoffs.

“We’re all out there to help each
other,” Poteat said of freshmen run-
ning backs Brandon Williams and
Ike Williams, who both will also
see action on the kickoff return
units. “If I would go down, one of
them will definitely be able ‘to take
over.” ‘

Head coach Walt Harris believes
he has two solid but inexperienced,
candidates to handle the punt return
duties. '

He said junior wide receiver
Tim Stein is listening to his coach-
es’ instructions and has improved a
lot. He also feels that Julius Dixon,

. another receiver, has a lot of talent

and could become a solid returner.
Pitt doesn’t use only backups
and bench warmers on the kick cov-
erage units. You’ll even see promi-
nent starters like Julian Graham and
Marlin Young chasing down kicks.
The Panther coaches realize that

I a game can easily be won or lost on

special teams, which‘ is why they’ve
focused so much attention‘ there.
Next time-Pittneeds to drop a
punt inside the 20 or boot a field
goal to win the game, the team

LYTLE

who is renowned for his quarter-
back-coaching ability.

After witnessing the transfor-
mation of Gonzalez, Lytle tried
imitating Pete to become a domi-
nant quarterback.

He studied ﬁlm during the off-
season, something Gonzalez did
last year. He began embracing
every word of Harris’ coaching
advice, and he worked himself into
the best shape of his life.

Lytle was widely considered a
better pure athlete than Gonzalez.
At 6-foot—4 and 225 pounds, he
was bigger and had a stronger arm.
But Gonzalez beat him because of
his better grasp of the complicated
West Coast offense.

Now, after spending that year
on the bench to learn the system, it
appears. Lytle has all but mastered
the scheme. V

“I’m leaps and bounds ahead
of where I was last year at this
time,” Lytle said of his knowledge
of the offense. '

So now Lytle knows the
offense, and he’s an incredible _ath-
le_te, but there’s one more area
where‘he appears to have made big
strides. It’s that intangible but
essential quarterbacking I-quality:
leadership.

All of the great quarterbacks
have that spark, that ability to ﬁre
up the team. Leadership was one of
Gonzalez’s outstanding qualities.
He had the kind of up—beat person-
ality that just energized everyone
around him. 1

When Lytle took the initiative
to walk up next to his coach and
address his teammates on that
steamy August afternoon in
Johnstown, he showed signs of
possessing that leadership ability.

When teammates were slack-
ing, Lytle’s voice sternly com-
manded, “Let’s go.” During
sprints, Lytle set an example by
racing in front of the pack.

But leadership is more than
that. Lytle also was there with an
encouraging pat on the back when
a lineman missed a block and got
an earful from the coaches.

Lytle beat out junior college
transfers Matt O’Connor and John
Turman for the starting nod.
O’Connor carmot be redshirted, so
he will probably serve as the pri-
mary backup this year, while
Turman, another impressive ath-
lete, may be groomed for the
future. .

But for 1998, the job is
unquestionably Lytle’s. He’s more
focused than ever, and the
Panthers’ season will go as far as
Lytle’s strong left arm will take
them. - '
