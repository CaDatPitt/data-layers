Charlesworth
To Head New
Service Course

Training In Government-
To Include Seminars
In Political Science

Publish Bulletin In May

Dr. James C. ('l1arlesworth, as-
sistant profc-:sor of political sci-
ence, has been appointed Coordi-
nator of the new Governmental
Service course, according to an
announcement by Dr. Elmer D.

Graper, head of the department
of political science, who made the se-
lection.

The course, designed to prepare
both gradua.t.es and undergraduates
for careers in public life, will be in-
troduced into the University curricu-
lum in September.

Commenting on the course, Dr.
Graper said: “We have hopes that
the top-notch students will be i11 gov-
ernment as a. career, and that a lim-
ited number of them will register for
the course.” He referred to the re-
cent address by Dr. E. M. Hopkins,
president of Dartmouth college, who
stressed the importance of the social
sciences in college curricula.

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of
economics, said:

“I consider this an important step
forward. VVe are glad to cooperate
with the political science department
in any way possible to make it a suc-
cess.”

Five political science courses which
have not. been given for several years
will be reintroduced for the govern-
mental service course. These in-
clude: 21, 22, International Law; 41,
42, National, State and County Admin-
istration; ? 61, Political Parties; 141,
142, National Administration; and 143,
144, State, County and City Adminis-
tration.

In addition, ﬁve new seminars will
be conducted, one for each division of
the course. For the foreign service
division, one in American Foreign
Service; for the International Trade
section, Government Trade Promo-
tion and Control; and one each in
Public,Administration, Taxation and
Finance, -and Labor Relations. The
first three of these seminars will be
given in the political science depart-
ment, and the other two in economics.

Full details of the course will be
given in a bulletin which will be pub-
lished by the department. Students
may obtain the bulletin by calling at
the oﬂice of Dr. Charlesworth, Room
225, Alumni hall, any time after May
ﬁrst.

Cap, Gown Show
Will Open May 6

Opening Night To Be Sponsored
By League Of Women Voters

Cap and Gowns musical comedy,
“In the Soup,” will open Monday eve-
ning, May 6, at the Nixon theater in-
stead of Monday, April 29, as pre-
viously announced.

his announcement was officially re-
leased yesterday by Theodore W’.
Biddle, chairman in charge of Cap
and Gown production. He said:

“Mr. Brown, manager of the Nixon
theater, is unable to accommodate Cap
and Gown on the previously announced
date. April 29 was set as a tentative
date but the Nixon has secured other
bookings for that week. Cap and
Gown has signed a. contract with the
Nixon for the week of May 6.”

The Allegheny County League of
Women Voters will sponsor the open-
ing night instead of the Civic club,
which has bought out the house in
former years.

There will not be aproduction for
the Shriners at the Syria Mosque, as
the Mosque has contracted for a cir-
cus the week of April 29 and will be
unable to sponsor a Cap and Gown
show.

Tuesday evening, May 7, has been
set aside as Alumni Night, an innova-
tion in Cap and Gown history.

Cap and Gown’s schedule for a full
week’s run is reminiscent of the days
of ’.28 and ’29. The show has not
played a full week in the last five
years. The matinee schedule has not
been deﬁnitely decided upon, but Mr.
Biddle indicated that there was a
strong possibility of two matinee per-
formances.

Theodore Viehman, Cap and Gown
director. who is now at Cambridge,

staging the Harvard “Hasty Pudding”

show, notiﬁed Mr. Biddle that he had
practically completed arrangement for
the Cap and Gown sets. Viehman will
bring the “Hasty Pudding” show to
the downtown Davis theater the eve-
ning of April 2.

John Hesselbein, BA35, was ap-
pointed chairman of the publicity com-
mittee at the last meeting of the Grad-
uate club.

Yearbooks Limited

Jules Green, business manager of
the Owl, University annual, has an-
nounced that the number of year-
‘books now available has been cut to
100. due to the fact that of the 775
books ordered from the printer, 675
have already been sold.

Association Selects News
Editor, Columnist For
Ten-Day Invasion

—..._—

By Ron

For the second time within a yeara
Pitt. News delegation goes below the
Mzisoii-llixon line, but this time it’s
not to a newspaper convention.

The ;‘»:len‘s Debating Association of
the University, with purpose to over-
whelm the natives of Kt-zntucky, Ten-
nessee, Alabama, and even those in
the very bailiwick (as the sports
writers would say) of Huey Long, suh,
have delegated lsrael Goldberg, C36.
and Edwin Banks, C35, as oﬁicial
inc-uthers of much argument, down
where the sun shines often-, the blue
grass blooms, and the natives never
pay to see the Kentucky Derby.

Goldberg, an associate editor of The
News, and Banks, one of the paper's
star columnists, leave Pittsburgh to-
day on their invasion.

Until l'vlonda_\;', lIial'(:l1 25. fond ad-
mirers and members of, The News
copy desk will hear of Banks and
Goldberg only through the printed
word——or many printed words, to be
exact—-which will appear regularly in
The News as Columnist Banks and
Associate Editor Goldberg forward dis-
patches on traveling conditions, de-
bating results, odds on Chance Sun,
and the relative fairness of southern
belles.

But it is serious businefss, and, ac-
companied by Richard l\/Iurphy, the
men will seek to prove to broadmind-
ed descendants of the wearers of the
grey, that the negative side of the fol-
lowing three questions is true, cor-
rect, and “enligl1t"ened: “Resolved.
that the na.tions should agree to’ pro-
hibit the international shipment of
arms and munitions; that the nations
should agree to the nationalization of
the production of arms and muni-
tions; and that the expansion of for-
eign trade is essential to the return
of American prosperity.”

At the University of Kentucky at
Lexington tomorrow, and at;Knoxville
college in Tennessee, Monday, they
will speak against nationalization of
arms manufacturing. At Kentucky
they’ll miss the blue grass blooming
by two and a. half months, and they’ll
probably have trouble sleeping in fra-
ternity house beds, but they’ll cer-
tainly meet some nice people and will
probably be invited to a SuKy dance,
where all the numbers are cut-ins, and
all the women drawl——except that
stunning person down there from
Binghamton, New York, who doesn't
even use “y’all.”

At Vanderbilt university at Nash-
ville, the point of contention will be
the international shipment of arms,
and the same question will be used at
Birmingham-Southern college at Bir-
mingham, Alabama, Wednesday.
Thursday, they attack both Tulane
university at New Orleans, Louisiana,
and the theory that expansion of for-
eign trade will do for this country
what the Democrats think they have
already accomplished. The following
day, _ Friday. Banks, Goldberg, and
lvlurphy trespass on the Louisiana
State university campus at Baton
Rouge, debate the same question, and

then investigate the “Sha.re the
Wealth” program among LSU stu-
dents—who should know what it's

about.

Saturday, Sunday, and Mo_nda.y they
shuffle back to Pittsburgh with tales
of wonder and beauty, and maybe
something about debating.

This is enough space on debating,
we trow.

Campus To Watch Un reeling
  Of ‘The Human Adventure’

 

Picture Reviews Formation Of Earth To The Glories
Of Ancient World; Work Directed By Dr. Breasted

“The Human Adventure,” an eight-
reel sound movie which carries the
viewer from the formation of the
earth to the glories of ancient Egypt,
Palestine, Anatolia, Syria, Iraq and
Persia, will be shown for University
students and faculty members on
Tuesday morning at 9:30 o’clock in
Carnegie Music hall. All second hour
classes will. be omitted to provide time
for the showing.

“The Human Adventure” grows di-
rectly out of the researches and ex-
plorations of the Oriental Institute-
tlie first and only laboratory for the
study of what Dr. Jaines H. Breasted,
director of the Institute, describes in

the ﬁlm as “the most 1'en:arl{able pro-
cess known to us in the universe:
The rise of man from savagery to
civilization." '

The picture carries the audience by
airplane through the lands where civ-
ilization first arose. There the in-
stitute has dispat.ched altogether some
14 expeditions. Eight of these are
observed while actually engaged in

the scientiﬁc recovery of the lost
chapters of the hunian a.clventure.

Some of the high lights of the ﬁlm
are the sequences in which Dr.
Breasted is seen and heard describing
the work of the Institute and the epic
rise of man; a ﬂiglit over the Persian
mountains, ﬂying in a sand storm in
Iraq, which reached heights of 12,000
feet; excavations which reveal 14 sep-
arate and distinct cities, each built
one upon the other with a Stone age
village at the bottom and the remains
of an early Christian temple at the
top; weapons made by Stone age men;
wheat fr"m the days of Joseph; the
stables of King Solomon; and many
other archeological ﬁnds of import-
ance to the historian of ancient man.

Separate trips were made from Chi-
cago to the Near East to produce the
ﬁlm, more than three years in the
making. Some 32.000 feet of ﬁlm
were exposed and much of the picture
was made from the air in more than
9,000 miles of ﬂying.

The University has rented the pic-
ture in conjunction with Carnegie In-
stitute, Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy and the Board of Public Educa-
tion.

SFA Votes Women’s Proportional
Membership, Amends Constitution

VVith a delegation from Mortar
Board, senior women’s honorary activ-
ities fraternity, in full force to see
that justice was done, the University
Assembly Tuesday night altered the

‘constitution of the Student Faculty
Association sufficiently to allow com-
plete proportional representation for
women in succeeding assemblies.

The Assembly also voted to do some
investigating hereabouts. Roger Han-
son, C36, moved for a special com-
mittee to investigate curriculum re-
form at the University, in cooperation
with an established WSGA group, and
also convinced the Inembership that
it was high time to do something
about eating conditions on campus,
especially in regard to the University
cafeteria. Both motions were upheld,
but a third suggestion, from Charles
B. I-Iolstein, C36, for a committee to
investigate living conditions of out of
town students on campus with a view
of betterment through the establish-
ment, perhaps, of University controlled
cooperative rooming houses, failed to
gain support. It was disclosed that
the Administration has been working
on the same plan.

Eight amendments to the constitir
tion were adopted. All of them had
previously been proposed by the Con-
stitutions committee, under Helen Mill-
iron, C35, at the last meeting, had
been tentatively approved, and had
been placed in the hands of a special
committee under J. C. Charlesworth,
assistant professor of political science,
for proper grammatical and parlia-
mentary construction.

The amendments insure the seating
of ten women among the thirty student
Assembly members, including ﬁve
seniors and ﬁve juniors, call for the
nomination of exactly sixty students
at election time for the thirty seats,
and deﬁnitely establish the voting
procedure for all forthcoming elec-
tions.

The Executive committee hereafter
will contain six students instead of
ﬁve, two of whom will be women. The
total membership of this body will be
nine, including the C-liencellor or his
representative, the dean of men, the
dean of women and at least four
seniors.

At spring elections, each student

may vote for two men and one wo-

man, and in selection of the Executive
(;omm'ittee, each Assemblyman may
vote for two men and one woman.

On motion of Wilson Loos, BA35,
chairman of the social committee, it
was decided to place faculty di-
rectories in each University building,
these directories listing the room
numbers of all faculty members.

The matter of the refusal of the Ex-
ecutive committee to grant a charter
to the National Student League, after
the Organizations committee, under
Homer VVadsworth, C35, had unan-
imously approved such a charter, was
discussed from all angles. Vvadsworth,
admitting that the petition had not
been properly executed, asked for a
reversal of the rules of his committee
to allow entrance of any group on
campus without a designated faculty
adviser—one of the chief deﬁciencies
of the NSL petition,

VVadsworth’s motion was defeated.

Leonard Marks, C35, chairman of
the Executive committee, reported on
the activities of that body over the
last month. He disclosed preliminary
plans for a Senior banquet, tentative-
ly scheduled for the eve of Commence-
ment, and reported on plans for a
University handbook to supplant the
present YMCA and WSGA handbooks

A proposal of the Constitutions com-
mittee to limit the composition of all
SFA committees to members of the
Assembly was defeated.

Hanson, chairman of the Speakers"
committee, reported that Norman
Thomas had been secured for a special
assembly on April 4.

lution, sponsored by Representa-
tive Herman I’. Eberharter, passed

Parts Assigned
For Third Show

Cass Names Complete Selections
For Players’ “March Hares”

Carl B. Cass, director of Pitt Play-
ers, announces today complete cast
for Henry Wagstaff C}ribble’s “March
Hares.” which will be the Players’
last presentation this year.

The cast of mildly insane characters
is headed by Charles Foreman, C35,
remembered for his work in “Chil-
dren of the Moon” last year. He will
be found constantly in action as
Geoft‘rey—the master nut, warily cog-
nizant of nothing but that which is
convenient. to himself.

The vague, yet steadying inﬂuence
of Mother Janet is in the hands of
Ruth. Shapiro, C37. who is undertak-
ing the part originally played by Lu-
cille Vvatson.

l\l"otl1e1' .lanet’s elocutionist daugh-

_ter will be played by Louise McKirdy,

C‘-36. “Fashion’s” Gertrude. As
Geoffrey’s contrary ﬁancee, she cre-
ates the situation of the play by
bringing home an affinity——Claudia
Kitts, who turns out to be everyone’s

.irritating itch and G-eoffrey’s particu-

lar annoyance." This upsetting contri-
bution to the Rodney mad-house will
be portrayed by Maxine Christensen,
C35. The role of Fuller, Geoffrey's
counter-attack to .l‘anet’s affinity, has
been assigned to .Toseph Wasel, C36.

Oliver, the manservant who amus-
ingly takes everything said to him in
its literal sense, will be played by
Paul Stinner, Ed.35, a new member of
the Players’ group.

Margaret Lewis, C36. will play the
part of Ethel, the Rodneys’ long-suf-
fering maid who possesses an unre-
quited passion for Geoffrey, despite
the fact that she is about to be mar-
ried. Ethel deserts the Rodney men-
age during the second act as a result
of this, dragging the cook, Ola Mc-
Grail, C36, along with her. Complet-
ing the cast is Charles Blaker, C37,
who as Mr. Brown, brings about a. sur-
prising check to Claudia’s misde-
meanors.

the University on the Southern de-
bating trip.

Miss C:1lab1'ese, the first speaker for

that the shipment of munitions was a

that one which would be 50 per cent

board, he said;

“If it was effective we would still
have smuggling. An example of this
was during the VVorld lllar when
Cliai-lie Schwab smuggled ﬁve war-

them as automobile parts, shipped the
parts to Canada and then to England,

Israel Goldberg, the second speaker

dangers of an international embargo,
declaring:

“The large nations which possess

From Scholars To Huey

And In The Lists Reveals A Yale About Eva LeGaIIienne

Scholars’ Day

ODAY THE U;\'IVl?RSI'l"Y does honor to students who have shown pro-

ﬁciency in making high marks, or attaining other scholastic distinctions,
while football letters and dance chairmanships fade for a few moments into
the background of campus events. ,

There still is a stigma which marks individuals who can brandish a
blueprint full of A15 at. the end of a semester. The art of grade making
seems to smell of the musty odor of midnight oil, and to
indicate a. perverted ambition. Just as the practical busi-
ness man dis-parages the crack brain-truster and the pro-
letarian suspects the intellectual, so does the average col-
lege man eye the scholar askance.

Popular criticism of the “A” student centers about
these points: First, he may be accused of pulling his pro-
fcssor’s leg to get his grade; any friendliness between
teacher and pupil is regarded as an unholy conspiracy.
Second, the scholar is considered a. fool; he concentrates
on his studies and consequently fails to occupy himself
with the joys of living—gin, co-eds, and dancing; and be-
sides marks don't mean anything anyway—tl1e company
which hires him as a corset salesman won't care about
his Phi Beta Kappa key.

All these criticisms are justiﬁed to a certain extent.
Nobody will maintain that currying favor with a. p1‘o1’essor
is a sign of Sll})el'lOl'll_V except in diplomacy, but at the same time a real in-
tellectual synipathy between both can hardly be deprecated. It may be
further true that some scholars have narrowed their existence to grubbing
about for knowledge, but the facts at Pitt alone show that high ranking
students in the main are also prominent in social and political activities on
the campus. As for the point that marks have no practical value, the charge
may be valid to a. degree. Probably most business houses do not require a
scholastic record from an applicant. But few scholars have ever regretted
their knowledge as enjoyment in itself. Most of them prefer" the hell of un-
derstanding to the bliss of ignorance, especially, since they question the de--
lights of the latter condition.

Vvhile more than one genius has ﬂunked out at college, professors will
tell you that the modern grading system is more accurate than misleading.
And if it is a legitimate function of a university to pat undergraduates on
the back for their athletic, social, and political success, surely it should
honor its scholars with proper signiﬁcance. After all, the prime importance
of an institution of learning is still to transmit knowledge to its students.

Give This Little Girl A Hand

LIKE THIS story and hope you will.

VVhen Pittsburgh newspapers featured Miss Eva Le Ga1lienne’s per-
sonal appeal for public support of her production of “L’Aiglon,” one of the
readers was a married substitute-school teacher of a. small town down the"
Ohio. The lady was so impressed with the actress’ plea that she sat down
a.nd wrote‘Miss Le Galliennc a. long letter. The substance of the letter was
the lady's explanation for the poor attendance at the play. She asserted
that there were thousands of individuals like herself, who enjoyed the legiti-
mate theater, but who couldn’t afford the expense of travelling to the show-
house and of paying for a. seat which wasn't located in the clouds or behind
a pillar.

The letter was not mailed until Friday afternoon, the day before the
ﬁnal performance of “L’Aiglon.” The lady had neither requested nor ex-
pected a reply. _

To her surprise and pleasure she received a. telegram from Miss Le
Gallicnne Saturday afternoon, thanking her for her letter and asking her
to be the actress’ guest at the Nixon that night. Four seats were available.

The lady, with her two daughters and a friend, saw “L’Aiglon” from
orchestra seats in the third row. '

Words, Words, Words

S TI-IE BATTLE of metaphors between “chocolate soldier" Johnson, and

his “pied piper” opponents, Father Coughlin and Huey Long, continues
to devastate the ether, it might be well to clamp down a stiff embargo on
verbal munitions and thus call a halt to the slaughter.

The time has certainly come when these worthies must be compelled to

cease mutilating that innocent victim of their squabble, the English language.
V\='ords may be rightfully used as sparks to the gunpowder of these redoubt-
able ﬁghters, but to mold them into bullets a11d poisonous gas is a crime
against the Anglo-Saxon culture, a violation of international rhetoric, a slap
in the face of the ﬁne art of oratory! Let us save the American language for
the American language, my fellow citizens! *
Permit me to offer this suggestion to our happy warriors: gentlemen,
why not soft-pedal the phrases henceforth and devote more time to old-
fashioned facts and logic. The American people enjoy being entertained,
but you are supposedly on the air for the purposes of instruction and per-
suasion. How about burying your dead cuts now and forever——they are be-
ginning to smell.

Dr. Abel Leaves

A train will pull out of Pittsburgh
for Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, about
10:30 this morning.

On it will be Dr. Raymond L. Abel,
head of the petroleum reﬁning depart-
ment, chosen by the VV-ar Department
as one of the 40 OfﬁC€l'S to take the
Command and General Staff courses
for national guard and reserve ofﬁcers
from M.arc.h 18 to June 15.

Dr. Abel, a major, will be back for
the summer session.

His sucldv-3n leave sounds like a re-
treat. It is. '

For three -weeks The Pitt News
worked on Dr. Abel. Finally it secured
the news only after it promised to
hold everything until the lust possible
minute. - ~ ‘

Through extra. effort, The News
learned Dr. Abel has quite a. dis-
tinguished war record.

As an e'nlistod man in the Third
Regular ‘Division—one of the most
famous in the war—Dr. Abel from
July 15 until Novenrbei 11, 1918, took
part in four major battles.

His regiment was in the Champagne-
Marne defensive, the Aisne defensive,
the St. Mihiel drive, the battle of
Chateau Thierry, the Aisne-Marne of-
fensive and the Meuse-Argonne of-
fensive, which ended in Germany.

IDI'. Abel received two silver stars
for bravery under fire and a second
lieutenantship.

As a farewell Wednesday he gave
his seven junior petroleum refiners the
stiffest exam of their lives.

Diving Champ

Red McQuillan is limping with hon-
ors today.

He holds his ﬁrst diving champion-
SIIID, Won despite a broken toe.

lLast Friday ‘the kophomore in
aeronautical engineering decided to
perfect his full gainer dive. one in
which the feet come up over the
head and around to hit the water.

Red leaped. His feet came up. As
he spun. down, one foot struck the
board and he plunged into the water
with a broken too.

But Red wouldn’t be held down.
He had the toe bandaged. The next
afternoon he did 1-0 stunt dives in
the semi-ﬁnals and won third place.

That night the ﬁnals of the East-
ern Swimming Association champion-
ship were to be held. Red practiced
most of the afternoon.

He won first place.

Here‘s one for you engineers.

A party of eight wanted to play
bridge the other day. It was decided
to play seven rounds so that each per-
son could have every other person
for,,a partner once. No two, however,
were to oppose each other more than
twice.

They worked out the first two
rounds this way. 1 and 2 played 3
and 4, 5 and 6 played 7 and 8; second
——1 and 3 against 2 and 4, and 5 and
'3 against 6 and 7. Then they ran
into higher calculus, the Einstein
theory and a Pitt News reporter.

They switched to Old Maid.

There are only a few thousand co1'-

Remember, each player is to have
each of the others as  partner once
and is to play against each opponent
twice.

Delta Tau Delta and Kappa Sigma
scored clean-cut Victories in “A” and
 leagues, respectively, Tuesday, to
lead the two Greek loops and advance
to the ﬁnal round in the 1935 frater-
nity basketball tourney.

Kappa Sigma’s victory held the
spotlight for the evening. Led by
Michelosen, Hensley, and Groat, with
nine. eight, and eight points, respec-
iively, the Kappa Sigs came close to
white-washing the runner-up Phi Kaps
by a 35 to 3 margin. Furrie scored all
three of Phi Kappa’.s total from the
charity line.

The first half ended with the score
at 14-1. Kappa Sigma increased this
lead to 29 points, at which time Fur-
rie accounted for his other two free-
throws. A tight red-and-white de-
‘tense and a fast-breaking offense kept
l-“hi Kappa’s yellow and brown ﬁve
«_-ompletely in check throughout the
four eight—minute quarters.

Delta Tau Delta clinched the “A”
title in the early game by defeating
the last place Phi Epsilon Pi team,
:37-11. Duff led the barrage of Delt
field goals with 10 buckets. McClure
played a. ﬁne ﬂoor game for the vic-
tors and rang up ten points.

The Delt-Kappa Sig ﬁnal for the In-
terfraternity title will be played Tues-
day on the stadium ﬂoor. Runners-up
in both leagues will play in the pre-
liminary for the third place cup.

Both winners and runners-up in the
two leagues will automatically be

the best basketball players
ever to play under Panther
colors, has earned a place
on one of the country's
leading All-American bas-
ketball teams, the Kellog’s

team was based on 60 all-
opponent teams picked by
60 outstanding basketball
coaches and then boiled
down to the ﬁve best play-
ers by Les Quailey, well
known sports authority.

Others chosen on the
same team were Bob Kess-
ler, of Purdue, a.nd Ray Eb-
ling. of University of
Kansas, at forwards, Harry
Leroy Edwards, of Univer-
sity of Kentucky, at center,
and teaming with Cribbs at
guard was Bill Nash, of Co-

Groat, Connelly, MacDonald tribe
which has compiled an enviable rec-
ord thus far in relay competition will

The Cats and the Mountaineers each boast six wins and two

and will battle in a. playoff at the
West Virginia ﬁeld house Monday.-

There was a little too much Gocke,

to cope with on the fateful VVednes-
day, the 13tl1. -Getting 12, 11, and 10
points, respectively, the hlountaiueer
trio did enough scoring itself to sink
the Panthers. The Mountaineers hop-

were. ahead, 20-10, as the half ended."

The Panthers made an attempt to
get back in the ball game by pulling
up to 24-16 with ﬁve minutes of the

counted 12 points in succession to
give them a 36-16 lead with but seven

ed out to make it up, but Sleepy
Glenn's cagers matched all but three
of the resulting Panther points, bring-

Cribbs led the Pitt attack with
three ﬁeld goals and a foul for seven
points while Emrick was close be-
hind with two of each variety. Skip
Hughes counted five points from two

Says Ray Stevens, North American
Bob-Sled Champion: “When the last
heat-has been run, I light a Camel
and enjoy it to the full, knowing that
Camels never bother my nerves!"

 “I'm just an interested winter sports
fan," says Edward‘Kent. “But I'm with Jack Shea and
Ray Stevens when it comes to smoking Camels! I ‘get
a lift with a Camel’ when I'm low and need cheering‘
up, or when I'm tired. And the fact that tobaccos of
a choicer quality are used in Camels goes far to ex-
plain why Camels are so mild and pleasing, and never
jangle my nerves. It means a lot to me that millions
more are spent for the tobaccos used in Camels."

Senior Women
Select Dresses
For Graduation

Glass Plans Including Sophomore
Luncheon, Faculty Tea, Boat
Ride, Dance Accepted

Alternate Choices Given

A long seleeved dress or a short

sleeved jacketed dress, ﬂat crepe 0:‘,
These are the cliiefl

ribbed acetate?
problems senior women must solve in
selecting their academic dress.

A one and a two-piece dress. both
shirt waist models, were named as
the alternate choices by women at the
senior academic dress style show on
VVednesday afternoon at Heinz SHouse_

But the puzzle is not just a problem
of choosing a long puffed sleeved dress
or one with a three-quarter length
coat. V.-"omen who select the two-
piece style may decide upon a plain
skirt, a kick pleat in the front of the
back of the dress, or both.

Both models button up the front,
but the short sleeved style has the ad-
ditional adornment of an ascot tie,
and it may be selected in either a
ﬁat silk crepe or ribbed acetate.

The three-quarter length coat may
be selected with either raglan or set
in sleeves, and it can be ea.sily worn
with other summer dresses.

But there are some points for the
other dress as well. Neat tucks across
the bodice, and the latest fashion note.
a Clark Gable back. are inducements.
Both dresses are ﬁnished with a two
and a half inch hem.

The names of the stores at which
these dresses may be bouglit can be
obtained at Heinz House. Both sell
for $6.50.

The entire class program, which in-
cluded the sophomore luncheon, facul-
ty tea, and commencement night boat.
ride and dance, was accepted by the
senior women.

Instead of Miss Amos discussing
the “Meaning of Coronation” fol-
lowing the supper, the members voted
to hold a special class meeting and
tea, at which the address and display
of coronation robes would be given.

Color In Accessories
Is Spring Forecast
Says Reporter

It's not raining daffodils this spring,

‘it's raining color in accessories, if the

latest Fashion reporter, style bulle-
tin of the Researcli Bureau for Retail
Training, is to be believed.

“Color, color everywhere in access-
ories—blouses, scarfs, flowers, hand-
kerchiefs, jewelry and even gloves,
bags and shoes cry ‘Color’,” the Fash-
ion reporter begins. “The spring sea-

?son of 1935 brings us new styles and

new fabrics in every item of feminine
apparel to lend variety and individual-
ity to an ensemble.”

Under the head of “Accessories
make or break the spring tailleur,” the
Fashion Reporter describes the dif-
ferent accessories to be worn with
spring suits. For instance, with a
navy blue suit, brown gloves, bag and
shoes should be worn, a green sweat-
er and hat, and marigolds for ﬂower
contrast.

V»-"i‘th a brown jacket, bag and shoes
should be worn a brown and white
striped skirt, a deep red -blouse and
ﬂower, and a slate blue scarf. Sim-
i1arl_v. red and white Carnations and
a. violet blouse lend color to a black
suit, hat, gloves, bag and shoe e11-
senible.

A combination in the gray is the
ensemble that calls for a rust hand-
kerchief, gold jewelry, a brown print
scarf, a yellow blouse and hat, brown
gloves, bag and shoes with a gray
suit foundation. ,
