The Rating Sheet, devised by assistant to the Dean of

Men, Richard A.,Cunningham,

will grade each fraternity ac-

cording to certain standards setlby the Dean’s office. ,

These standards will encourage the fraternities to bet-

At the end of each,-semester, the Dean’s list will rate
each fraternity, A, B, C, ‘D or E, according to satisfactory

Since the list of fraternities
earning an A or B will be made
public, it is felt that this infor-
mation will be agreat help to
the pledges during, rushing sea-
son. Some fraternities feel,
however, that the Dean’s office
should go even further and give
information on size of frater-
nities and their various riues
and initiation fees- A

This information could be put
together in the form of a bro-
chure, giving the rushee pin-point
facts on each group.

It is generally felt that the
Dean’s Rating Sheet will keep
thefraternities on their toes, try-
ing to _, better their individual or-_
ganizations.

However, some felt that the
system will help the stronger
fraternities, and put the weaker
ones in a position which will be
difficult to overcome.

Several groups felt that preju-
diced gradescwill result. They
would like a different system of
grading than the one proposed.

Don Kettering, president of
IF, feels that the Rating Sheet
V will help the administration and
visiting national fraternity offi-
cers keep tab -on respective chap-
ters. It is his opinion that the
fraternities will work together
better than they have in the
past. Many of the fraternities
have been weak in IF iwork.
Kettering said, “The grading will
. have more of a binding effect.”
sCunningham pointed out that
while many of Pitt’s fraternities
have been strong in this ‘general
locals, they are very weak on a
national level.

Speciﬁc _ Rules Listed

By Special Effects
In New Production

Sounds of a heart beating
and shivering vibrations are
only two of the special effects
Pitt players will employ in
their third production, “The
Innocents” by Wiiliam Archi-
bald. -

Adapted from Henry James’
“The Turn of the Screw,” a
mood of eeriness and suspense
creates the undertone forthe
entire production.‘

Performances begin tomor-
row evening and continue
Friday and Saturday at 8:30 p.m.
in the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Under Harvey Pope, director,
and Lloyd Welden, Jr., scenic
designer, only six characters are
cast in the play. Four have
speaking roles; two represent
evil inﬂuences.

‘Joy Smith, speech major, por-
trays Miss’ Gibben, a sensitive,
young and attractive governess
who is experiencing her first
position.

Taking the part of — a long-
standing‘ maid and housekeeper
is Louise Chianese, Educ. ’56.
She acted in “Harvey” earlier
this year, and; won the Players
leading actress award last year
for her role in “The Grass
Harp.”

Herb Rehbun, Bus. Ad. ’55,
plays Miles, a very unusual and
mischievous teen—ager. He won
the best actor award last year for
his role in “The Grass Harp.”

Ten-year—old V i o -k i Buchs-

ent younger daughter who is the
sister of Miles. The other roles

Basic Course in Humanities Helps
‘Students T 0 Understand Man  

‘ Editor’s*note: This is the first of a series on the basic courses

being planned for next year’s Core Curriculum.

By JUDY

GOTTERER

To start the student on his ‘way towards understanding

the nature of man and human existence is the aim of the

Humanities Committee, one of four groups planning basic
courses for the new core curriculum program. ‘

To reach this end, the committee, composed of six faculty
members, have beenmeeting since early in the fall semester,

creating, deﬁning, analyzing,

and planning a basic humani-

ties course which will introduce the student to a considera-

/tion of values, in human char

acter and’ conduct.

. Students will be given instruction and practice in analyz-
ing and understanding the most signiﬁcant available outward
evidence of man’s achievement which reveal or suggest the
nature of man and human existence.

Torganization Plans

The committee is now consid-
ering ways in which the writings,
music, and art could be shown
and organized in the course. The
following are some 0 the possi-
bilities:

(,1) From periods in man’s his-

tory when he has been especially

productives; such as the early
Mediterrean world (Athens, Pal-
estine, Rome), the “high middle
ages” in France and Italy,‘ 14th
century Florence, 16th century
England.

(2) From the productions of"
individual men who had excep-
tional insight into human nature
or great creative ability—Hom-
er, Sophocles, Plato, Dante,
Shakespeare, Goethe, Phidias,

Michelangelo, Leonardo, Bach,
Beethoven, and Mozart.
(3) From important civiliza-

tions such as Egypt, India, Pales-
tine, Greece, Rome, Western
Europe, America,

. Data to be considered and dealt
with will include written mate-
rials (imaginative literature, phil-
osophy, history, religious writ-
ings), music, and fine arts (archi-
tecture, sculpture, painting).

Possibilities for grouping or
arranging of data are by peri-
ods, by kinds (literature, music,
fine arts), by national cultures,

». by “tempers” (classic, romantic,

realistic, etc.) , by f a_ c e t s of
man’s nature (aesthetic inter-
ests, e t h i c a l preoccupations,
by

level ‘of difficulty.’
According to Dr. Putnam F.

Jones, head of the committee, the
liberal aim of the course will be
“to produce right values in peo-
ple.” “We hope that students will
becometo be aware of values,”
he said.
Understanding Goal ,

The course will center around
the system of how to think about
and understand the various kinds
of material achuman being en-
counters in life. It will discuss
what it is like to be a numan be-
ing, considering, “Are we just
maihines? What is religion? Is it.
better to be a human being than
an animal?” . .

Students will examine the
best the world has known in
music, writing, and art. “One
thing that gets people in trou-
ble most often,” said Dr. Jones,
“is usingthe wrong tool for a
particular. job-looking for story
value in painting; comparing
music to a piece of literature.”

The committee hopes to train
students to become perfect prac-
titioners by developing a kind of
thinking appropriate for under-
standing all data.

Towards the development of a
sense of values the committee
hopes to give the student an ap-
preciation of “humaness” or
“man-at-his-best” as differentiat-
ed - from “less-than-humaness”
(animals, animal-like men, ma-
chines, systems, etc.) ‘Respect for

the worth and dignity of the in-
dividual is another goal to be
achieved. '

The student will be lead to-
wards a discrimination of values
in human conduct, perhaps with
encouragement to make a be-

ginning on the formulation of a ’

personal code. A He will also be
made aware of aesthetic values
--a recognition of what is effec-
tive, first-class work in litera-
ture, music, and the -fine arts.
At the moment, the committee’s
problem is the_ course outline.
\ Course Structure
Tentative structure plans for
skills to be developed by experts

presenting lectures. Weekly lec-‘

tures will be drawn from the
various departments represented
in the course, with the subject
matter of the week’s work deter-
mining the choice of lecturer.

The three-credit course will
meet three times per week, once
for lecture, twice for discussion
meetings. Discussion leaders
will be staff members of the
departments represented in the
course.

Members of the committee,
he_a__ded byv Dr. Jones, include:
Harry C. Goldby, assistant pro-
fessor of Modern Languages; Dr.
William C. Panetta, assistant pro-
fessor of Classics; Dr. John W.

Acid Cause
Of Tumors
In Plants

Researchers in the medical
school have uncovered an
“ugly duckling” molecule, _ a
major constituent in bacteria,
which causes tumors in plants:
the American Cancer Society an-
nounced recently.

‘The. substance, whose nineteen
carbon‘ atoms form a unique fatty
acid chain, is lactobacillic acid.
It is found in three types of in-

— testinal bacteria.

Dr. Klaus Hofmann, professor
and chairman in biochemistry,
ﬁrst identiﬁed the molecule. He
will test it on laboratory rats to
see ii‘. it acts as a normal nutri-
tional element or cause disease.

The researchers don”: know if
the “ugly duckling” plays any
role in human or animal cancers.
They will try to discover how the
living cell manufacturers the fatty
acid by removing sections and
altering the structure of the
molecule-methods d e v i s e d by
Hofmann. ,

gationswere Drs. Robert A. Lucas,

 R.HoVey Lectures

To Near Easterners

By ROSE MARIE SCARPIELLO

Walter R. Hovey, head of the Pitt Fine Arts department,
recently returned form a “good-will” lecture tour of the
Near East where he was impressed with the enthusiastic stu-
dent response to visiting lecturers in the universities.

“Often just a brief announcement that an American lec-
turer was to speak to a university group resulted in-standing

room only in the lecture halls,”
he said. ‘

The lecture tour was planned
by the U.S. Information Service
of the State Department under the
specialists program. Hovey was
chosen “s a specialist in the fine‘
arts ﬁeld and represented the
United States ﬁn the subject of
“American Art and Architecture.”

Cultural ‘ Ambassador .

His job as “cultural ambassa-
dor” lasted for three months dur-
ing which time he visited muse-
ums, art centers, and YMCA
groups.

Lecturing and showing slides
of American art and contem-
porary architecture, he made
most of his appearances in Leb-
onan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, In-
dia, and Ceylon.

He said that his audiences in
Iran were especially receptive to
American social conscious paint-
ing and contemporary architec-
ture.

American Architecture

One of the examples of Ameri-
can architecture which Professor
Hovey used in his lecture slides
Was the Edgar J. Kaufmann home
at Bear Run, designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright.

Since his tour, P r o f es s or
Hovey is convinced of the ex-
treme impo,rt-aince of the cul-
tural affairs program of the
U.S. He said that tours such as
his helped to clear up false im-
pressions that foreign countries
have of our American way of
life.

to develop the fine arts gallery;

and library at Pitt. -

SC Reaches No Decision on Women

By AL LEFFLER

Student Congress centered
one of their liveliest discus-
sions of the year around the
integration of women into‘po-
litical parties at their meeting

A last Monday.

Betty Ann Young submitted her
committee’s majority report for
an. interim approval, with a mi-

The nucleus of the report was an
incomplete poll of women con-
ducted during the past week to
determine how they felt towards
the integration and whether they
would join the parties it the plan
went into effect. "

The tabulations separated the
independents from the sorority
members showing: In favor of
integration of Women-Independ-
ents, 109-26; Sororities, 65-22.
In favor of joining a party-Inde-

To New Pledges

Monday night 118 girls pledged sororities. This is the

same as pledging any other group. It will mean nothing
until you know what it is for. Findout what the organiza-

tion stands, and then work hard toward that_ goal. And

then you will grow with it, getting what you give. You
will have lasting friendships'—if you make them. You will
have the warmth and satisfaction of working with a group,
close when you start, closer when you ﬁnish—if you par-
will develop an understanding of other per-
sonalities, other beliefs, other ideas——if you let yourself.

If your group can be improved, improve it. Find out
what needs to be done before your goals are realized, and
do it. Then you will be satisﬁed and ready to go on to
something else. 

You will learn in your group. You will see what makes

Religion-ln-Life . . .'i

Everyone Must

(Editor’s note: Bob Dickinson, treasurer of the
Religion-in-Life committee and president of ODK
writes the second of a series of columns by lead-
ers of the annual religious program. Dickinson
states some of his personal beliefs concerning the
theme “Accent on What is Vital.”)

By Bob‘ Dickinson

I believe that everyone must believe in some-
thing. In fact, all of us believe in many things,
our school, girl friend, parents,
but I think that above and be-
yond these beliefs, not that they
aren’t important, but more im-
portant should be a belief in or‘

superhuman power. This by no
means says that all men have
the same concepts of this power,
or worship and think about it
in the same way. 1 . Z

Religion—In-Life Week will be successful if it
does nothing else but make us stop and think
about just what we believe. It also offers many
opportunities, to meet some of the outstanding con-
temporary religious leaders and through this ex-
perience to understand more complete/ly what they
believe. '

During this week there will be many opportuni-
ties to gain an insight into what others believe
and how they worship. Also, a discussion or two

 

may develop on the meaning of life and the insig- '

niﬁcance of our existence, which could prove to
be very interesting. There will be speakers at
manyclasses, ﬁreside chats in the Commons Room
and speakers at many of the campus organization’s
meetings. All these will provide a chance to gain
more information about religion.

You Never Hear from the Herd . . .

Learned Robots

By Jim Deweese
The University is not doing its job. Or per-

._haps the blame lies with the students themselves.

The fact remains that the students apparently are
not learning to think for themselves. Either that
or they just don’t care enough to think._ In either
case we have an unhealthy situation.

Zane Grey wrote a book some time ago whi h
he titled “The Thundering Herd.” " “
It was the story ofithe great but-
falo herd that roamed the praries _
of the West and gradually dis-
appeared. .

Within the Gothic walls of
this University we also have a
herd. Unfortunately it gives no
indication of ‘disappearing. Like
the buffalo it is comprised of
great numbers who appear con-

tent to sit with blank faces and chew unproductive‘

cues. Unlike the legendary herd about which Grey
wrote our herd utilizes the Tuck Shops as their
meeting ground.

There Are Leaders But . . . ,

Any group -as large as this must have a number
of leaders and there are, among the students who
live in the Tuck Shops, a number who think and
then put their thoughts into action. But_ that num-
ber is too small when compared to the mass which
is content to sit and gripe and make small talk
about small things.

And they do gripe. For instance there is the
perpetual cloud of complaint about the student
governing bodies at Pitt and certainly the Pitt
News has been one of the most consistent wielders

  
 
  
 
 
 

Beheve

good one. “I would deﬁne true religion as being
right belief and right feeling taking place in right
action.” People through the ages have taken vari-
ous stages of belief in order to satisfy both emo-
tional and intellectual needs. Religion has evolved
fromi belief in animals to the present concepts of
a order of the universe, a superhuman power behind
the world. "

These are two factors that have caused men to
develop beliefs. The ﬁrst is that men who think a
little have always sought an answer to the mean-
ing of life. Why? How did the earth get here?
Are there other earths? When and how did life
begin? A belief or awareness of a superhuman
power has been man’s answer to the problem of
cosmology. Along with thinking man’s intellectual
desire to know more about the why of the world
has been his emotional desires.

The emotional desires are the ones that were
ﬁrst aroused in man, his fear of rain, the sun, and
his subsequent worship of them. Emotional desire
is still an important factor. Many times new love,
security, reverence, sympathy, and a desire for
security are the emotional desires that turn man
to believe in a superhuman power.

Parallel Development

As society has developed, so have man’s reli-
gions. From the beginning in animism, which was
focused on nature, through the polytheistic beliefs
in personalized spirits and jelling with hanathe-
ism, where one of the polytheistic gods was place
above another, has come montheism, -which is the
basis of many of today’s great religions. A

It is almost trite to say that every man is en-
titled to worship in his own way. It is true, how-
ever, it would be better if each one of us in this
three—day “Accent on what is vital,” not only toler-
ate other’s religious views, but actually take all
the opportunities presented to understand their be-
liefs, in effect, ‘what they, “accent as being vital."

of the lash. Recently Student Congress polled the
students on several questions. First Congress asked
for opinion on the revival of a student magazine.
Then students were asked for their opinions on
political parties. -

. The polls-were tabulated and the results listed in .~

an impressive break-down form. But they don’t
show whatthe students want. Time and again the

students who were being polled asked, “What '

should I put? How did you answer it? What do
you think?" The question is not what.the people
conducting the polls think.

Inevitably many students refuse to take the

V time to answer the polls at all. But the majority

grudgingly push their coke ‘and potato chips aside
and agree to ﬁll out the questionnaire.
False lnquisitiveness

It has been said that an» inquisitive mind is a
good thing but when ,a "student scans a question‘-
naire he is not being inquisitive in the correct sense
of the term. He is looking to see what his friends,
or enemies, listed as their opinions. He is looking
to see what the majority thinks. And, he will
agree with that majority, blindly following the
student who was polled before him who blindly
followed the one before him . . . ad nauseum.

The answer to the problem of non-thinking
students is not immediately obvious. The new Men’s
Orientation Program which began this year may
provide a partial answer. Perhaps the Core—Cur-
riculum with its broad scope of subject matter will
supply a further solution. Only time will reveal
whether these and other plans now under considera-
tion will provide future students with an inertia
whieih surrounds and is ignored by the Tuck Shop

If the spirit should ever move you to write me a letter—and
it's always a pleasure to hear from you——take pen and paper and
address me c/o Philip Morris, 100 Park Ave., New York 17, N. Y.
Or if you don’t have any paper, snap open your Snap—Open

the neat brown wrapper inside out and use it for stationery.
The regular size Philip Morris pack is perfect for short notes.
For longer letters use the king size pack. For chain letters and
-petitions, glue several packs together. « i

This week’s column is devoted to a few of the many interest-
ing letters that have been coming in:

SIR: - -

Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years ago.
On my very ﬁrst day I got into a bridge game at the Students
Union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never gone to
a class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do is play bridge.

To explain my long absence and keep the money coming from
home, I told a harmless little lie. I said I was in medical school.
This made Dad (myfather) very proud. It also enabled me to
keep playing bridge. We were both terribly happy.

But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended last
week when I was home for spring vacation. I arrived to ‘ﬁnd that
Sister (my sister) was inthe hospital with an ingrown spleen.
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by a
hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.

“Oh, never mind,” chuckled Dad (my father). “Harlow (me)
will ﬁx Sister (my sister).” ‘

Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school
which would be a dirty shame just when I am getting to under-
stand the weak club bid. \

There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. I got Sister
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself com-
pletely at a loss as to how to put her back together again. Can
you suggest anything? They’re getting pretty surly around here.

Harlow Protein

Dear Harlow, v

Indeed I do have a solution for you-—the solution that has never
failed me whenever things close in: Light up a Philip Morris!
Knots untie as you pull‘ that rich vintage tobacco. Shade becomes
light as you taste that mild fragrant ﬂavor . . . And as you watch
the pure white smoke drift lazily upward, you will know that
nothing is as bad as it seems, that it is always darkest before the
dawn, and that the man worthwhile is the man who can smile!

SIR: -
Do you think a girl should kiss a fellow on their ﬁrst date?
Blanche Carbohydrate

Dear Blanche,
Not unless he is her escort.

SIR:

Here is a rather amusing coincidence that may amuse your
readers.

Just off the campus where I go to school there is a lake called
Lake Widgiwagan where students from time immemorial have
gone ﬁshing. Thirty years ago when my father was an under-
graduate here he went ﬁshing one day at Widgiwagan and
dropped his Deke pin into the water. Though he dived for it for
many weeks, he never recovered it. ,

_Just y_esterday.—thirty years later, mind you—I went ﬁshing
at Widgiwagan. I caught a four pound bass. When I got the ﬁsh
home and opened it up, what do you think I found inside of it?

You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dempsey-Firpo ﬁght.

Fleance Fat

Dear Fleance, I

It certainly is a small world.

Penn State Last Mat
Before Panthers Defend Title

A
V

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

With the 33-2 rout of the Toledo
Rockets stashed away in the rec-

ord books, Coach Rex Peery’s .
grapplers will attempt to close —

their 1955 season on a pleasant
note by taming the Penn State
Nittany Lions at the Field House
Saturday.

.~Going by comparitive scores, the
Lions appear to be one of the
strongest opponents that the Blue
and Gold will have faced all sea-

‘ son and should give observers a

sneak preview of the locals’
chances of successfully defending

their Eastern Collegiate title.

- In pulverizing the Rockets, the
only Panther who ‘failed to record
a win was Bob Szekley, soph re-
placement for the

pound opponent to a draw.
Another severe blow was dealt
theifortunes of the Peerymen last
week when heavyweight Dan Wis-
niewski of Erie suffered a rib in-
jury that prevented him from

competing at Toledo and could

possibly sideline him for the bat-
tle with the Lions. If Wisniewski

-is unable to go, Ron Schirf will

get the assignment in the import-

‘ ant heavyweight division.

Probably the most under-rated
member of the Panthers is Bob
Cook of Munhall. The 147-pound

‘ senior has been one ‘of the most

reliable grapplers for the Blue and
Gold, and has helped them get out
of more than one crucial situation.

With only the State meet left,

Reliable senior wrestler

the Panthers still have three mat-
men who have yet to come out on
the short end of the score. They
are Joe Solomon, defending NCAA
167—pound champion, Ed DeWitt,
and Ed Peery. ‘ ‘

Dave Johnson, the locals’ repre-
sentative in the Pan—American
Games tryouts at Fort Sam Hous-
ton, Texas, ﬁnished fourth in the
160%-pound division. Thus he
won’t be eligible to participate in
the ﬁnals at Mexico City because
only the winners in each class are
selected. ‘ '

After the Lion meet, the Peery-
men will compete in the EIWA
and NCAA tournaments.

Rutgers Splashes in Pitt Pool
‘ Finale; Panthers Lick Lehigh

After overwhelming a good Lehigh team, 54-30, last
Saturday, Coach Ben Grady’s tankers are preparing for their
last dual meet of the season with Rutgers this Saturday at
the ‘Pittsburgh Athletic Association pool.

_ Against the Engineers, Roy Kaupe, Skip Monsein, and
Hank Zentgraf combined" to win the 300-yardmedley relay
gpod lead and they were never

to get the Panthers off to a
headed.

Other winners for the mermen
were Jim Zurcher in the 220 and
10‘0-‘yard freestyles, Warne White
in the individual medley, Bill
Furrer in the 440-yard freestyle,
and Monsein
backstroke. The freestyle relay,
composed of Kaupe, John Lath-
rop, Zentgraf and Zurcher, also

won to climax a good evening for-

the Panthers. L L

Monsein set a new Pitt record
in the backstroke, turning in a
time of 2:22.2 for the fastest Pan-
ther time in that event.

White pulled somewhat of an
upset by beating Lehigh’s Ed
Dederer in the individual medley.

.By virtue of this win, White now

looms as the man to beat in the
Easterns.

Coach Grady appeared very

dwell pleased with the showing his

in the 200-yard.

squad made at Lehigh. “You haye
to give the boys a lot of credit,”
he said. He further commented,
“They’ve really. come a long way
this season.”

Originally, this was supposed
to be a rebuilding year because of
heavy loses by graduation but
the squad has racked up a 6-4
record thus far, and now looks to
retain its Eastern championship.

Rutgers, the opposition for the
Gradymen this Saturday, wasn’t
on the Panther schedule last sea-
son but finished third behind Pitt
and Lehigh in last year’s East-
erns. Since they were not hit too
hard by graduation," they are ex-
pected to be among the favorites
in this year’s competition and
should prove a tough opponent
for the locals.

As expected, in the last hoop’

the Panthers dropped a close one

at State College. The locals had
clipped the Lions by ten points
earlier in the season at the Fiel

The Panthers lost the ball then,
on a controversial play and the

For the Blue and Gold hoopsters
the big news of the night was sup-

meshed 31 points to break Charley
Hyatt’s career standard of 913

to 929 over a career which took in

the Panthers did not fare as well so the Pitts came out sixth

in the team scoring.

The headline-making Sowell, who is now
heralded runners in the nation;

easily copped the 10050-yard run
and then ran a brilliant last leg
in the mile relay to help Joe
Dudas, Ed Saunders, and Bill
Green bring home the other first
place for the Panthers.

This was the last winter com-
petition for the trackmen as they
‘now, prepare for the outdoor sea-
son which begins in April. Sowell,
however, will leave soon for the
Pan-American games in Mexico
City. _‘

Only two home dual meets are
on this year’s card but both, Ohio
State and Penn State, will be

strong attractions. Other features

include participation in the Ohio

-Relays, Penn Relays, and the out-

door IC4A’s in New York.
The schedule:

Apr. 2-Navy (Away)

Apr. 16-Miami, ,0. (Away)
Apr. 23-—’Ohi'o Relays (Away)
Apr. 29‘-3v0—Penn Relays (Away)
May 7-—Ohio State (Home)
May 14-—Notre Dame (Away)
May 21-—Penn State (Home)
May 27-2.8-—IC4A’s (New York)

When Arnie Sowell travels
to Mexico City to compete in
the Pan American games it
will mark the second time this
year that Pitt athletes have
traveled outside the continen-
tal United States. A few

Game Only Disappointment

Walking“ Around in   Nittany. Land 1

Aside from a little more grey hair for Bob Tim-
mons and another disappointing loss for the Panth-
ers, the trip to State College was a wonderful one.
The weather was ﬁne Saturday and the Nittany
Lion Inn more than accommodating.

It ss 1: it

It was obvious, as one Penn State student
told me, “They love Jesse / Arnelle up here.”
When the mikeman was announcing the starting
lineups he would call the ﬁrst and last name of
each player—except for Arnelle whom he called in
an emphasized voice, “Big Jesse Arnelle.” The
crowd cheered him for every move he made . . .
I’d like to know what kind of a spell he has on
everyone . . . Wouldn’t mind seeing his scholarship
terms either. -

After the game, he and referee
Tony Senapole got along great.
They walked off the court shak-
ing hands and talking—Arnelle
patting Semafore on the rear and_
congratulating him on his ﬁne
‘(?) job of refﬁng and the ofﬁcial E
commending ‘Big Jesse for his
ﬁne play. Hardly right you say?
That’s what’ we thought too.

Riser

I’ll never condemn the Carnegie Tech ﬂoor again.
State’s is no better—wors'e if anything. The light-
ing is poor and the floor is nothing to brag about.
One thing the court did have, though, was blue-
painted keyholes. This is a big help to the ref in

spotting violators of the three-second rule.

We hit the small college townat the climax of

   

   

the fraternity rushing season and,. as one frat boy
put it, “This is really our weekend to howl.” . It
seemed like everyone you talked to was planning
excessive indulgence of beverages that night. The

frat house we stopped at was already off to a

good start early in the afternoon.

by knocking off a few tunes on the harmonica . . .

It iwas quite a performance that Lazor, Darrel

in the lobby . . . With Lazor and Lewis alternat-
ing on the “88’s” and Zimmovan doing‘ both the
emceeing and the vocals, the show had other hotel
guests in the lobby getting a kick out of it too.

A team the Panthers met only once this year, George
Washington, placed two players on the Panthers’ All-Op-.

ponent hoop quintet, it was announced today. The two hoop- « ‘

sters’ Corky Devlin and Joe Holup, were at the Field House
early in the season to help the Colonels cop the Steel Bowl
Tournament. ' 9 ‘

Even though they only played
against the locals once, they must
have impressed Coach Bob Tim-

a big majority '
of votes.

Another note-worthy observa-

Evidently the Steel Bowl does

annual Field House tourney since
three of the ﬁveappeared here in
