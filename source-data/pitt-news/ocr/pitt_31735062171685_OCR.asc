Prologue Program Suffers Setback  

by CAROLE COVAL

After four hours of heated dis-
cussion. debate and quibbles over
parliamentary procedure. the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
lFAS) voted 136-81 on a motion to
return the Prologue Program to a
reconstituted Arts and Sciences
Review Committee for alteration.

The new ASRC will be “more rep-
resentative“ of students and fac-
ulty. .

The motion. proposed by Pro-
fessor Irwin Schulman of the Po-
litical Science Department. will
not shelve the Prologue Program
entirely. A new proposal. revised
in light of the criticism and objec-
tions voiced at the meeting is ex-
pected within one year.

Some of the primary objections
were revealed when Dean Jerome
Schneewind. who proposed the
program. called for an informal
consensus late in the meeting.

In repsonse to questions about
the desired structure of the new
proposal, an overwhelming “show
of hands” determined that the
role of the “tutor” should be more
specifically defined. The compe-
tencies of each tutor in a certain
field should be regarded with stu-
dent interests in mind.

Individual speakers also leveled
criticisms.

Vice-Chancellor Bernard Ko-
bosky and members of the
Dean of Student Development's
staff will be available for ques-
tions between 3 and 5 p.m.
Wednesday in Dining Room A
on the first floor of the Stu-
dent Union. Coffee will be
served at the session, open to
all students, the second of its

kind.

' Professor Samuel Hays of the
History Department noted the
triple functions of the Prologue
Program as problems which
“should be tackled separately.
The advising. counseling. and
teaching aspects are problems
with which we should be concern-
ed." he said. "but good advising
takes an enormous amount of
time. In the teaching field. con-
stant performance and evaluation
is a big responsibility."

Evaluation, itself, was identi-
fied as “the heart of the problem,”
by Professor Schulman. One meth-
od of evaluation which could be
considered by the new Arts and
Sciences Review Committee was
suggested by Professor John
Townsend of the Physics Depart-
ment. He recommended that a
manadatory record of accom-
plishment be kept in the form of a
portfolio.

"In this way. goal setting is a
part of involvement." he stated.

The Commuter Association
(CA) will meet Tuesday at 4
p.m. in 232 CL. The meeting
will concentrate on new pro-
jects and nominations for new
projects and nominations for
new officers.

Positions available include
president, vice president, sec-
retary, and treasurer. Actual
elections are scheduled for Fri-
day from 10-4, 360 Cl.

lnstallation of new officers
and elections of two represen-
tatives to the Student Govern-
ment Social Commission are
slated for Tuesday, Feb. 2.

County

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Allegheny County’s prosper-
ity depends on whether the
State Legislature solves Penn-
sylvania’s financial problems
during the next two months,
County Commissioner Thomas
Foerster argued Saturday.

“If we do not solve our state
fiscal problems in 60 days.“ Foer-
ster warned. “we will not even
have our present level of services
in Allegheny County."

Foerster. along with fellow
Commissioners Leonard Staisey
and William Hunt. participated in
a day-long conference on County
Government in the Cathedral of
Learning. answering questions in
the afternoon.

During the occasionally lively
session, Commissioners Staisey
and Hunt locked horns over the
question of a metropolitan gov-
ernment. Staisey. who disagreed
"that metropolitan government is
an answer." denounced proposals
to "consolidate Allegheny Coun-
ty‘s municipalities." and contend-
ed that decentralization makes for
strength.

“The citizen has control over
what's happening to him. under
our present setup.“ Staisey ar-

F gued.."WeMca_r,_i accommodate. 129

municipalities and still give to our
people the services they need. "

Hunt, predicting that “volun-
tarily, for their own well-being,

communities will gather togeth-'

er,” contended the county “should
provide communication, educa-
tion, and crime identification fa-
cilities” to its boroughs and town-
ships.

"1 don't believe we need 129
municipalities.” he concluded.
"But a reduction must come from

individual action. not from above."

Hunt maintained during anoth-
er segment that Allegheny Coun-
ty should have its own mental hos-

_ pital.,,‘-‘It's wrong to admita men-

The practice of compiling a port-

folio was initially suggested in the

‘ Prologue Program on a voluntary
basis.

Professor David Bramhall of

the Economics Department out-
lined the history of the Prologue
Program in his introductory com-
ments to the FAS. He described
the proposal as “an effort to ex-
pand the present possibilities open
to freshmen education. It will give
students the opportunity to direct
their own learning,“ he said.

Small lectures and demonstra-
tions would have been provided
through the program to increase
the students’ awareness of ca-
reer opportunities consonant with
their interests and talents.

Of primary importance to part
of the faculty present at the
meeting was the economic aspect
of such a pilot program. Profes-
sor Hays labled the program "fi
nancially off base." He felt that
the program would drain funds
and eventually pre-empt funding
small. successful honors courses.

Professor Bramhall contended
that small seminars “would not

lose out..nor was this an attempt 
to rob a departmental budget.” In

support of his statement, Profes-

sor David Houston claimed that at .

“freshmen would generate more
than twice as much as needed”
for the program funding.

Although the Prologue Pro-

gram was defeated, there is still 

the matter of curriculum change
behind the future efforts of the
new Arts and Sciences Review

Committee. Among the criticisms I
and objections raised at the FAS A

meeting, was an alternative sug-
gestion offered by Professor Stev-
en Rosen of the Political Science
Department.

In an Alternative to Prologue,
Professor Rosen outlined team-
taught introductions to English,
Natural Sciences, Social Sciences

and the Humanities. In addition to ‘ ’ if

these courses, would be a Pro-
logue-type groups designed as dis-
cussion areas.

Education Fair Features Holt

"Encounter in Education. a
‘three-day fair concerned with in-
novative ideas in education. will
be held Jan. 28-30 here.

The program. sponsored by the
Undergraduate Cabinet in Educa-
tion. will open Thursday with a
lecture by the famous educator.
John Holt. author of such books
as How Children Fail and How
Children Learn. The lecture. in
which Holt will discuss some of
his new theories in education. will
be held at 7 :30 p.m. in the Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall.

Betsy Werner. chairman of the
Undergraduate Cabinet. explain-

tally ill. violent person to a gen-
eral hospital." he declared.

Sidetracking momentarily, Hunt
suggested that mental patients
might be fewer if universities of-
fered courses in human relations.

"In this University." he said. "I
doubt that there‘s any attention
paid in the college curriculum to
‘how to get along with a man" or
‘how to raise children.”

Later expanding on his educa-
tional philosophy. Hunt express-
ed reservations about County as-
sistance to students attending a
Community College. "Part of the
educational process is learning
that it costs money to get an ed-
ucation." he offered.

Skeptical of the need for a
broad pre-professional education,
Hunt said society should be able
to “make nurses out of people
who aren't even high school grad-
uates.” Unable to resist, Staisey
retorted, “Based on your think-
ing, Commissioner, do you think
we can go back to midwives?”

Asked whether the local Model
Cities program has suffered t'rom
patronage appointments. Staisey
denied the charge. “There's no
politics in the Model Cities pro-
gram." he contended.

Staisey added that he hopes‘ to
convince the private sector to be-

ed that Friday's program would
open with Holt and Charles Sil-
berman. the guest lecturer for
Friday evening, appearing on Ma-
rie Torre‘s television program.
Contact. Pitt students and mem-
bers of the faculty have been
chosen as members of the televi-
sion audience.

tapes such as Summerhill. My

come more involved in the hous-
ing field. He said United States
Steel is likely to "help furnish
housing“ near its Braddock plant.

Pointing to the same phenome-
non, Foerster proudly described
“Pollution control facilities en-
tirely paid for by Allegheny Lud-
lum Steel.” According to Foers-
ter, “Pollution control is the fast-

- est growing industry in the coun-

try.”

The day-long conference was

sity‘s Citizenship Information

cratic Action. and the League of

Student Involvement \

by POHLA SMITH

Wade Lawson. newly-elected
Committees Commissioner. ran
for election on the promise to try
to get those students who have
never been involved to take an ac-
tive part in their Student Govern-
ment. Now that he is elected. he
plans to put that promise into ac-
tion.

One of Lawson's priorities is
the organization of non-resident
students. “We have to get off-
campus students organized so
that they can have a structure
from which to work for their de-
mands," he declared.

The new commissioner plans to
look into the possibilities of ob-
taining sleeping quarters in the
Towers dormitories for com-
muters during the spring and
summer sessions. The rooms
would be available on a nightly
rental basis as in a hotel of a
boarding house.

Lawson, a junior urban affairs
major, is also going to try to ob-
tain more parking spaces for off-
campus students.

“One of my most important du-
ties will be to make students
aware of the facilities of Student
Government," the Commissioner-
elect explained. “For instance
students should know that the Le-
gal Awareness Committee of Stu-
dent Government (SG) has sev-
eral lawyers available for legal
services.”

Trustees is part of Lawson's plan.
He feels that students should have
elected representatives, such as
the four commissioners, sitting
on these decision-making com-
mittees.

Besides working in SG. Lawson
is involved with the Black Action
Society (BAS) and the Public Af-
fairs Committee. He is also on the
Board of Directors for Disturbed
Students under the University
Community Education Program.

Lawson talked at length about
his role as the only black commis-
sioner in SG.

‘'1 do not plan to be the token
black man on SG.“ he declared.

,But he explained that he does
not plan to make his position
strictly one of obtaining services
for blacks, either. He plans to
work for all students who have
not previously benefited from SG
services.

“Because you're black. you‘ll
try to get more blacks involved.
They are part of the alienated stu-
dent body." the commissioner-
elect explained.

Neither does he feel that his in-
volvement with BAS will inter-
fere with the time he must devote
to SG.

“I do not plan to make SG an-
other voice of BAS,” Lawson af-
firmed. “My expertise in BAS
should help in getting more stu-
dents involved and in implement-
ing new programs.”

The newly-elected commission-
er foresees a problem in working
with his three associates under
the four-man board system. “Two
of the other three are more or
less individuals in their efforts
and we have to eliminate individ-
ualism to work for the good of-the
students.

“Our main job is to make all
four commissioners work as one.
Individual differences must be eli-
minated for the benefit of the stu-
dents." Lawson said.

K lavonic Previews Entertainment

by BOB BONN

The new Student Government

Social Commissioner. Lenny
Klavonic. has outlined plans to
have two—or more—concerts a
month at the University.

In a Pitt News interview. the
former presiden-t explained that
concerts with big—name groups
are possible through the Pitts-
burgh Student Association. a
group which includes all the
college Student Governments
in the city.

“First, we have a date on Sly
and The Family Stone for March
15,” Klavonic said, “We want to
get the Civic Arena for it, and
John Flaherty, the
brother, is going to act in our
behalf. ‘

“If we can get the Civic
Arena on this basis. the Stu-
dent Association would like
to offer a deal ofthis sort every
month. Tickets would be ‘sold
at $2, $3, and $4.“

Secondly, Klavonic noted.
there is little reason why the
University couldn‘t sponsor a
concert on its own each month.
Using what is known as block
booking arrangements‘. he said.
some well-known groups can be
obtained at a very reasonable
cost.

For example, Livingston Tay-
lor would ask $3,000 total for
three appearances in the area.
So if, say, Pitt, CMU, and
Chatham got him, it would cost
only $1,000 each.

“Concerts like these could be
held in Common Facilities."
Klavonic said, “Livingston Taylor
would cost about $1 a ticket and
Ronnie Dyson. the soul singer.
would cost about $1.25.

A very important . point.
Klavonic emphasized. is the use
of the $8 Activities fee. "As

far as the students are con-.

cerned. they’re not getting near-
ly $8 worth of entertainment.

‘ “There’s nearly a quarter
million dollars in activity fees,
and so far the entertainment has
0 been out-and-out bad. What I
would like to do is get a larger
portion of this money for enter-
tainment.” I

The SocialCommissioner noted
that Winter Weekend and Greek
Week were allocated only $5.-
000 each to help subsidize their
concerts, while outstanding
groups like Chicago and Sly and
the Family Stone cost $20,000
each. the‘ Jefferson Airplane
charges $17,500, and Diana Ross
asks $22,500. I

"This school‘s been lacking
‘diversity in entertainment for
some time." Klavonic asserted.
"One of the things the four
commissioners are doing is mak-
ing the committees responsible
for weekends directly responsible
to us. to make sure there's no
monopoly on any one type of
entertainment. We'd like to see
soul. jazz. folk. rock. and blues
all represented.“

Another proposal by Klavonic
is that there should be a ques-
tionnaire on the back page of
The Pitt News every two weeks
listing all available groups in
these five areas.

"By April. then. we’d have
several thousand questionnaires
for a basis to decide on what
groups to get. If Santana is
the most popular group in the
rock area. for example. then the
committee had better go after
Santana ‘instead of. say. Pink
Floyd."

The newt commissioner also
mentioned other possibilities

for additional concerts. With
reciprocal ticket arrangements.
students could attend showsat
other colleges.

Also, record companies like
Mercury, Elektra, and Columbia
have arrangements where they’ll
premier their new talent, pay
the cost of, facilities, and charge
only $1 for tickets. This is done
to test audience reception to
new acts.

SPEAKERS AND FILMS

Moving away from concerts.
Klavonic discussed other types
of entertainment which he plans
to initiate. “One of the things
I'd like to do is provide more

films at the University. The mid-

night-to-dawn Chiller Theater
during Freak Week was such a
success that I’d like to do this
every Saturday from 12 to 4.

“Also. I‘d like to get weekday
film festivals going during, the
afternoon in the Student Union
featuring Humphrey Bogart.
Clark Gable. or W. C. Fields.“
These would be held jointly
with the Commuter Association.
and would take place once a
week.

Klavonic also hopes for a
diversity of speakers, “and not
just a visiting professor to dis-
cuss his latest dissertation.”
Names he mentioned included
Muhammad Ali, Jane Fonda,
Dick Gregory, and William
Buckley. . . “people in the pub-
lic eye all the time,” he added.

Beginning in February. Stu-
dent Government will

will be a dance every Friday

because I still feelthe same way.
. . . Well maybe not exactly the
same way. but I still cannot bring
myself to hate another human be-
ing. (Ah. I can hear the comments
now: ‘

“Damb, the brother sho be’s on
a weird set; '

“What's the matter with this
nigger? Well. he still ain‘t gonna

humanist (remember that almost
extinct little creature. usually
characterized by its cries of
“mankind“ and ‘‘everyone'‘'?)

Here it is 1971. Almost four full
years since the idealism column
was written. I’ve been through
Cleaver, Baraka, Mao, H. Rapp,
and Ron Karanga. But I cannot
hate.

It's really kind of puzzling.
Hate is so rampant today. so how
come I got left out? Why can't I
do like everybody else is doing?
Even a little smattering of ani-
mosity would do.

One would think that with all the
different criterion we have estab-
lished for hating each other. that
it would have been very. very easy
for me to come up with at least
one reason. Just take a look. We
hate because of color. sex. reli-
gion. customs and mores. political
beliefs. length of hair. the sounds
of the voice. financial status. etc.

It’s as though to hate is the ac-

cepted practice of mankind. It is
supposed to be around.

I'm a Black humanist. That

means that I will strive to help-

those from which I came. but I
will in so doing also try to help all
society. My one hatred is for
hatred among people.

Cant ya feel enough for another
human being who may be differ-

solve your differences? We all are
a little better than animals aren't
we—well. a tiny bit better any-
way. huh?

Oh. drug it. What's the use?
Keep on hating hear. For if you
keep on there ain't going to be
any differences in anybody to hate
because dead people have that one
big common denominator. the all
powerful arbitrator.

point of view will be presented
fairly and objectively.

In short. Don. I would be very
disappointed if The Pitt News
does not gain national recogni-
tion for this year for its achieve-
ments. I would hope that you
would convey my sentiments
to all of the members of The
Pitt News staff who have contri-
buted to the success of the

S(i’s Future ,: Nine People and a Constitution

by BILL GORMLEY

Student Government is at a
crossroads. Starved for credibil-
ity and attention. it is sporting
a new image in an attempt to
convince us all that it is not ob-
solete.

The four new Commissioners.
elected Wednesday. know that

,the future of Student ‘Govern-

ment at this University is at
stake. Perhaps they also know
that few are disturbed by that
fact.

Realistically, apathy is not likely
to be cured . - by either diag-
noses or tirades. Nor must it be.

None of us can berate our
fellow students for not caring.
not voting. or not volunteering.
After all. they may be wiser
than some of the politicians
whose ranks they refuse to join.

Apathy. however. is no excuse
for a failure of leadership. Cam-
pus leaders cannot abdicate
their responsibilities. simply be-
cause they lack a Pied Piper's
charm. To do so is to deprive
students of a vision of import-
ance which. though it is an illu-
sion. nevertheless serves a bene-
ficial purpose.

During the next few weeks,

"the spotlight of the Pitt News

will zero in on four students -
Denny Concilla, Lenny Klavon-
ic, Wade Lawson, and Ted Mich-

alik - who ‘hold the future of
Student Government in their.
hands.

The four have won the lead
roles in thedrama which is
about to unfold. Five others -
Mike Hout. Dan Mazzei. Chris
Ryckman. Lou Ann Kanouse.
and Rich Sotak - have the bit
parts.

For better or worse. the ‘nine
will be judged on their speed.
their efficiency. and how‘well
they follow the rules.

According to rules adopted by
the student body November 18,
Lawson must, by February 10,
appoint heads of the Orienta-
tion, Finance, Public Affairs,
Research, Student Services,
and Calendar committees. Until

‘he appoints a Calendar Commit-

tee Chairman, g the extremely
important Social Commission
cannot function.

First—-The next time you see a
magazine with a picture of a
female “cutie". immediately
write a letter to the editor de-
manding equal space for male
cuties in an equivalent state of
undress (after all we're human
too).

Next—Consider any “men only“
sign a red flag. That means
charge. ladies. (If you find you
have charged into a room full of
topless porcelain bowls and sinks.
retreat).

Third—Remember that most
rapes are committed by dates
and friends. Don‘t allow your-
self to be degraded. If they
start getting too friendly. attack
them first.

Finally—-To be sure you don't

forget that we live in a sexist.

world. find at least five examples
of rampant sexism every day.
If you can't find them. you
obviously have a mental block
and should call Virginia Joyce
immediately for counseling.)

Forward Sisters.

Arlene Hagen

is certainly not 1

By February 3. Hout. Mazzei.
Ryckman. Kanouse. and Sotak
must. with Michaliks approval.
appoint students to serve on
their respective academic coun-

cils. By February 10. each of"

the five must appoint one stu-
dent to serve on the Academic

Commission with them and
Michalik.
Concilla. Klavonic. Lawson.

and Michalik ‘must. by Febru-
ary’ 10. appoint the students
who will serve on the University
Senate and its committees. Also.
before the Program Commission
can function. the four must agree
upon its members.

Of the utmost urgency is the
establishment of the Social Com-
mission, which must exist be-
fore any Allocations Committee
recommendations, including re-
commendations for a New Alloca-
tions Committee, can be approv-
ed.

With commendable speed.
Paul Hensler has called a spe-
cial meeting of the Commuter
Association for February 2. at
which time the Commuter Asso-
ciations representatives to the
Social Commission will be
elected. If the Men‘s Dorm
Council. Women‘s Housing Board
and the’ General Studies Cabinet
act with similar dispatch. they too
will merit applause.

Also essential is the swift es-
tablishment of a new Recogni-
tions Committee. Should a new
group appear on campus. it
will be condemned to oblivion.
until it can secure the okay of
a Recognitions Committee. Ac-
cording to the ‘Constitution.
however. ‘a new Recognitions
Committee must be approved
by the Social Commission. Thus.
it is extreme] im ortant that a

'I‘he

One of America's

 

Social Commission be formed

without delay.

During the recent campaign,
Dennis. Concilla and others
pointed out flaws in the new
Constitution. For example, the
Constitution provides that “the
recommendations made by the
Allocations Committee shall be

approved by the undergraduate
‘student representatives to the

University Senate Council (the
four Commissioners) and the
Social Commission of the Stu-
dent Association.”

However. in case of a dead-
lock. it gives neither the A110-
cations Committee nor the ten-
person group authority to.appro—
priate funds without the consent
of the other. It is not difficult to
imagine an impasse of the sort
we saw earlier this month.

Such a situation cannot be per-
mitted to exist. Student Govern-
ment's credibility is clearly con-
tingent on the Commissioners’
quickly remedying the situation.

There is a final problem - the
obscurity of the functions of
each Commissioner. Overlapping
work and jurisdictional disputes
are distinct possibilities, until
the Commissioners agree on
their respective obligations. Once
they decide, it might be useful
for them to publicize their con-
clusions, lest the student who
wants help from his servants
must first wander through a com-
plex and frustrating maze.

Student Government is indeed
at a crossroads. Surely. there is
"a path of a responsible service.
But. if Student Government
follows instead the well-worn
path of procrastination and in-
efficiency. it will be condemn-
ed to the Vcul-de-sac it can
easily find.

Dear Editor.

Ronald Reagan once said.
“The problem with Liberals is
not that they are stupid. It's
just that they know so many
things that are not so." Your
columnist. Mr. LeBlanc. seems
to be afflicted with the same
malady. His article in the Janu-
ary 20 issue of The Pitt News
is not a discussion of conserva-
tive views. It is instead a dis-
cussion of what Mr. LeBlanc

would like to think conserva-
tives believe.
For instance. Mr. LeBlanc

states that conservatives "quiet-
ly accept the massive power of
U.S. Corporations." 1 refer him
to the works of Von Mises. Senn-
holz et al. The concentration of
political power in the hands of
corporations is a characteristic
of the mixed economy and hence
is opposed by the advocates of
the free market.

He claims that we defend the
status-quo-nonsense! Our “ideal

system. Nor are the sacred cows
he presents so sacred.

If perchance Mr. Le Blanc
desires to be enlightened about
the American Association of
Manufacturers I should be de-
lighted to explain precisely what
I find so despicable about this
spineless pack of crypto-social-
ists who dare to call themselves
businessmen. If he cares to read
a right wing attack on the AMA
I refer to him to innumerable
editorials by John Campbell in
Analog. .

Our defense of many of the
institutions of Western civiliza-
tion is secondary to our devo-
tion to freedom. Civilization pro-
vides a framework in which
freedom can exist. Barbarism
provides none.

Finally concerning our alleged
anti-Black Position - it is to be
expected that one who is con-
ditioned to thinking in terms
of class warfare would consider
our criticism of the Black Pan-
thers anti-Black.

What Mr. Le Blanc fails to
see is that the Black .VIan‘s

   

problem is one of individual
rights. Such problems are not
amenable..-    ‘  "cm

 Pm Rifle Squad Off
 Target As Duquesne

Shooters Hit Bullseye

by STEVE ZYCH

The Pitt rifle team's lack of practice showed last Friday when they
were easilyldefeated by a superior Duquesne squad to the tune of

1302-1241.

The lopsided score was indicative of the long layoff the team had
since their last match in November. The Dukes. who had practiced
regularly twice a week over their semester break. displayed fine form

as they had four shooters hit a
250 or above. They were: Dave
Willard (275). Bob Cygrymus
1266). team captain Bob Daile_v
(254)iand Gil Marchik (259).

Willard is the league's number
two shooter behind Bob Dover-

._spike of league leading Indiana
’ University of Pennsylvania.

The top shooters for Pitt were
Sparky Yourick (258), team cap-
tain Bill Crooks (251), Bruce Bar-
rett (250) and newcomer Tim
Schmidt (246).

The Pitt riflemen, now 3-2.
will try to rebound this Friday at
6 p.m. in a three way home match
with Clarion and Washington and
Jefferson.

The match should see three
evenly matched teams as all three
average between 1230.and 1250,
with Clarion having the highest
average of the three and winless

The Cheerleaders have an-
nounced dates for practices and
tryouts for any undergraduate
students.

Final tryouts will be held
Feb. 22-23 at the Trees Hall
Dance Studio, but six practice
sessions are slated before then.

. The cheer drills will be in the
Student Union Ballroom on
Monday, Feb. 1; Tuesday, Feb.

W and J the lowest. It will be the
Pitt shooters’ first home match of
1971.

The loss to Duquesne dropped
the team into third place behind
Indiana and Duquesne but with
the home range advantage and
competition of equal caliber. the
marksmen could rebound this
week and pick up a pair of vic-
tories. which if coupled with a Du-
quesne loss would put the riflers
back into second place in the
Western Pennsylvania Intercol-
legiate Rifle Conference. despite
the long layoff and Fridays de-
bacle on the Bluff.

Girl Gymnasts Lose To

Penn State In Squeaker

The women‘s gymnastic team
traveled to University Park Sat-
urday to face the Penn State Lion-

esses. but the “Pink Panthers”

lost by the very narrow margin of
four-tenths of a point.

Pitt gymnast Becki Volkin stat-
ed, “Our team should have won.
We just didn‘t do our best. but in-
experience was too much for us to
overcome.”

Pitt Coach Gail Santillo, the

gymnastic squad’s mentor, be-
lieves that both the male and fe-

male gymnasts here at the Uni-
versity can achieve national pro-
minence with intense practice and
greater fan support.

Coach Santillo remarked, “Pitt
gymnasts have the ability and de-
sire to reach the pinnacle of suc-
cess. With greater team effort
and increased student attendance
at home meets, I'm sure gymnas-
tics will become a winning sport."

The next women's gymnastic
meet is scheduled for this Satur-
day. Jan. 30, at Temple.

Smeltz Pin
8 Highlights
Mat Action

by MIKE MILLER

Bud Smeltz handled the hero-
ics as the Pitt matmen upset
Michigan 19-16. for the Panther
grappler‘s fourth victory of the
season.

The 150-pound bout proved to
"be the deciding factor. Bud
Smeltz. wrestling above his
usual weight class. was trailing
Michigans Jerry Hubbard 11-3.

' with’ 6:19 gone in the match.

when he scored the decisive
pin in a sudden turn of the ac-
tion.

“We had to have it,” remark-

’ ed Pitt coach Dave Adams after

the match, Adams pointed out
that the match not only gave the

team its three point victory
margin, but it also provided
some security for the heavy
’ weights.

“Most people don’t realize how
(Bob) Kuhn and (John)
Chatman are hurt." Adams said.
“Most guys wouldn‘t wrestle in

I . that condition."

Kuhn has torn cartilage in
his rib cage. Kuhn‘s style of
wrestling involves a great deal
of curling up and rolling. and
the injury hampered his tech-
nique enough to give him a 9-4
defeat at the hands of Bob
Huizenga.

John Chatman wrestled des-
pite a back injury.

“He just gave it enough to
win.” stated the coach. Chat-
man reinjured his back in the
match. but managed a 2-0 de-
cision.

"I cant say enough for the
effort of the whole team from
Cox right on through." stated
‘Adams.

Al Cox, a walk on, replaced
injured Steve ‘Weiss at 118.
Cox's opponent, Jerry Hoddy
placed sixth in the N.C.A.A.s
and was runner up in the Big
Ten last year.

"But Cox was right in there

going ' after him the whole
time.“ the coach remarked.
Mark Pa_vne made his first

appearance this season and won
a 13-3 decision. Payne has miss-
ed quite a bit of practice and
was not in top shape according
to Adams.

The wrestling mentor had
hoped for a slightly larger vic-

~ tory margin, though.

“I felt Tritch should have
won." he said. Adams vigorous-
ly opposed a referees call

Rickey, Relay Team

Star In

by VINCE DiNARDO

The Pitt Track team had one
of its typical performances at
the Philadelphia track classic
Saturday. In the combined day/'
night competition. the tracksters
took three first places along
with a barrage of other fine
showings. (But. they have not
yet reached their potential.)

“I was very pleased, each
week we look a little bit stron-
ger". said coach Jim Banner.
"but there is still room for im-
provement in some areas". he
quickly added.

Jerry Richey, Pitt's mile rec- -

ord holder, had another “great"
performance in winning the two
mile race.

“Jerry did another job for
us." continued Banner. “He was
sick before. but he's coming
back now. It was the first big
two-mile win of the year for
him. He beat a lot of good two-
milers."

Richeys time in t.he two-mile
run (8:48.8) was good enough
to beat Donald Walsh and Greg
Frederick both of whom had
beaten Richey during the Cross
Country season."

Bryant Salter who was just
about in shape, according to his
coach, hurt his foot attempting
to high jump and wasn't able
to contribute.

"Bryant went out of the pit
and hurt his foot." Banner said.
“I don‘t think it will keep him
out too long though."

Despite some mismanage-
ment of the baton. the mile re-
lay team made another impres-
slve performance in the win-
ning the mile relay.

“Ted Bobby had some trouble
handing the baton off to (Den-
nis) Schatzman, but Schatzman
made up for it and by the time
Smittie (Brown) and (Dorel)
Watley were through it was all
over;-,” joked‘ Banner. A ‘

had trouble before in handling
the baton. Two weeks ago in
Washington. Bobby dropped the
baton and by the time Schatz-
man could retrieve it the team
ended with a third place show-
ing.

"Its just one of those things.“
explained Banner. “They have
to get used to each other. They‘ll
getit.“

afternoon at the Field House.

The Panthers fired 61.8 per-

half, taking a solid, 48-40 lead
into the locker room at half-
time. Kent Scott scored 15
points in each of the two halves
to lead all scorers with 30
points.

“That was a great game“
said Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl diir-

in the locker room. “We made a

coach Normal Sloan waited for

his team to dress.

“Pitt really did a fine job,"
he said. “They‘re a well-dis-
ciplined team. and I wasn’_t
surprised at anything. I thought’
we would be more aggressive
in the first half. but we weren’t.
They (Pitt) did a good job on
defense and took the ball away
from us while‘ we just stood
around and watched."

Carving the Panthers‘ 8-point
lead down to nothing. the Wolf-
pack tied the game with 14:24
left to play. then went on to take
their biggest lead of the after-
noon 66-61 four minutes later.
Buzzy Harrison entered the game
and set the Panthers rolling. as
the Cats fought the pack into
a 68-68 deadlock with five min-
utes left in the game.

From that point on it was an’

the next 27 points to ice the
game. The points piled up as
the Panthers’ Harrison, Riggle

As the game reached its final
moments, a large number of
the 2,063 fans began chanting
‘NIT, NIT, NIT.’ When asked
about the possibility of a post-
season tournament Ridl said,
“We’re hopeful—but that's a
little far off. We’re just try-

ing to win games like this
one.” -
The Panthers reached their

largest lead, except for the final
score with 12 minutes left in
the first half. 26-14. At that
point the Wolfpack‘s two big
scorers, Ed Leftwich and Paul
Coder. began to chop away at
the Panther lead. Leftwich fin-
ished the game with a hard-
fought '24 points. which was
high for the pack. Coder domin-
ated the offensive boards, get-
ting most of his 23 points on tip-
ins and lay-ups.

Bill Downes offered the crowd
some first half excitement, tak-
ing a swing at the Pack‘s Dan
Wells. Wells, a surprise start-
er for N.C. State, has the in-
famous reputation down in the

ACC of ‘being “Dirty Dan’
Wells. The conflict was ended
quickly, and Downes went on

to score eight points in the con-
test.

"They played well, and I ex-
pected them to,“ said Sloan after
the loss to Pitt.

F rosh Height  

) , . A7



Prevails Over C ubs

by MARTY HELLMAN

The front line of the North Caro-
lina State freshmen basketball
team used its height advantage to
the utmost against the Panther
Cubs on Saturday afternoon and
propelled the little Wolfpack to a
99-79 victory.

The tall trio, led by not-so-little
Wolf Tom Burleson at 7-4 and for-
wards Steve Nuce and Steve Gra-
ham combined for a total of 70
points and 25 rebounds.

Despite their overall height
disadvantage, the Cubs stayed
close until midway through the
second half when NC State began
to pull away after Mickey Martin
and Jim Bolla fouled out.

I Attempting to combat the Wolf-
pack front line, a total of four
starting Cubs got into foul trouble
and eventually left the game after
five. Sam Fleming and Ken Wag-
oner jointed Bolla and Martin on
the bench in the closing minutes.

Burleson proved deadly at the
line by converting 13-of-17 free
throws to add to his game high
total of 27 points.

“Too many of us spent too much
time on the bench because of
fouls," said Cub Coach Tim Grgu-
rich after the game. “Anytime
you let the other team shoot 46
foul shots, you are going to have a
tough time winning."

Although Martin watched most
of the game from the sidelines,

he wound up as top Pitt scorer
with 14 points. Fleming netted 13
points and tied with Martin as
leading rebounder with eight.

In the first half, both teams
started slowly and had many turn-
overs. The Cubs held a brief lead
at 15-14 after Fleming hit two in a
row. but the Wolfpack regained
the lead on two successive long
shots by Graham and Burleson.

"When the first five were in the
first half. we played them even."

‘continued Grgurich. "The fouls

were what hurt us."

The Cubs whittled a 10-point
halftime deficit down to four with
12:30 left in the contest. Disas-
ter then struck when Martin re-
ceived his last two fouls within
the space of 20 seconds and
from then on, the only thing in

question was whether or not the
Wolfpack would hit the
mark.

Although Burleson was a k_ey
factor in the NC State win with his
offense and his intimidation of
many Cub shots. several frosh
were not overwhelmed by his
play.

Both Bolla and Fleming agreed
that "he was just big and not that
good."

Wolfpack coach Art Mussel-
man was extremely pleased with
his center’s performance. '

"This is the first game that he‘s
consistently played well on de-
fense.“ he remarked. “He didn't
meet up against a lot of good peo-
ple in high school and he needs
this year to improve." I

PSU Merntert Defeat |IM Hoop Action)
Pitt In Upset, 65-48

by JAN FRY

For the first time in 21 years the Panthers dropped a swimming
meet to Penn State Nittany Lions Saturday afternoon as the mermen
lost their third consecutive meet. 48-65. before a crowd of about 100

onlookers.

“Sometimes you're up and sometimes you‘re down.“

remarked

Pitt Coach Bill Grant. "We were up for West Virginia Wednesday and
I thought wed stay up for Penn State. Penn State swam ahead with alot

of steam and they were too much
to stop."

The Lions. who reinstated var-
sity swimming only four years

V ago. had lost their two earlier

meets to Temple and Villonova
this season. Grant commented
that many of Penn States times
have dropped since the meet with
Villonova.

Pitt’s Jim Howell took second
in the 1000-freestyle, cutting his
time from the WVU meet by 2.4
seconds. -

Rick Rowe placed first in both
the 200- and 500—freestyle. His
times were higher than usual in
both (1:53.2 and 5216.8) but as
Grant put it." Rickie swam
enough to win.“

In the 500-free Tom Hayes took

7 first with a time of 22.7. Mark

Cohen placed second in a close
100-freestyle race with a time of
51.9. Penn States Krimmel won
that event with a time of 51.5.

Tom Hayes, Fred Lewis, Mark
Cohen and Rick Rowe combined
efforts in the 400 freestyle to win
with a time of 3:29.0. 1

In the one- and three-meter div-
ing events. Dave Wessel took first

” place ‘with scores of 264.25 and

274.0. respectively. Wessel. who is

eligible for the Nationals after

his one-meter diving performance
in the West Virginia meet. im-

proved his score in the three me-
ter against PSU.

Grant remarked. "Dave‘s
scores get better and better as
the season progresses.

Freshman Martin Staley placed
fourth in the one-meter event and
third in the three. “Martin is
learning to dive under fire,”
Grant said. “He’s solid enough to
keep on going even when a pre-
vious dive doesn’t go too well. He’s
doing fine.”

Grant believes the team "gave
everything they could give. “Penn
State was shooting for this meet.
It's one of their big ones of the
season. They had a little better
impetus than us and once we
started swimming everything
started to snowball."

quarter. Pitt was trailing by the
score of 8-7. and by the end
of the second quarter they trailed
22-11.

Foul shooting was Pitt’s main
problem; they scored only three
out of 14 foul shot attempts.

"We never settled down in the
first half.“ related co-captain
Elaine Kingas. "As a result our
shooting was very poor."

Pitt did a complete reversal
during the second half. With less
than one minute to play in the
third quarter. the Pitt girls closed
the gap. trailing now only by two.
At the end of the quarter. Pitt
rallied to a 27-27 tie.

The Pitt shooting continued to
improve in the fourth quarter,
but other problems developed.
Starters Phyllis Wojciechowski
and Tana Cascioli fouled out and
Rose Smith and Cathy Castle were
in foul trouble most of the quar-
ter. Pitt, however, continued to
close the gap on Kent State and
with two-and-a-half minutes left
in the game Pitt went ahead for
the first time, 31-30. 6

Kent States Ann Mathews tied
the score again at 34-34. with
only 40 seconds left. Then came

KSU, Ohio Judges

‘F by STEVE WILLIAMS
The Pitt gymnastic team fell to the Golden Flashes of Kent State

at Kent. Ohio. Friday. 131.51-115.98.

Despite the apparent deficit in Pitt's score. the team fared as well

as could be expected.

Lowell Meek and Christ Gardner weren‘t able to compete because
of shoulder injury in Meek's case and chickenpox in Gardner's.

Also during the match Dan-Campbell injured his shoulder on

his dismount off the parallel bars
and was not able to compete in the
hi-bar event which followed.

But the occurrence which hurt
the team's performance most was
the judging.

“We went into the meet know-
ing that Meek and Gardner would-
n't compete. stated senior ring-
man Jim Bilec. “But after the
judging of the first two events.

attitude started to crumble," he

the controversial call which led to
Ken‘ts 35-34 victory over Pitt. .

"We started hitting too late in
the game. We should have won,"
said Coach Bullman. “Our foul

and the offense needs work. We
just have to keep working at it.“

points were deducted from the
scores of Pitt gymnasts.

As Mike Beatty said after the”

meet. "The judge whom I was
talking to admitted missing three
‘C’ class tricks (tricks of the high-
est difficulty) and two ‘B‘ class
tricks which build up my score.
He didn‘t even notice my original
move. How can he feel qualified
as a judge giving me a 6.85 for an
8.5 routine."

But despite the alleged “poor”
judging Pitt stayed even with KSU
until the last event. Pitt entered
only one man in the event which
resulted in a loss of 15 points.

Phil Lilly performed a routine
on the side horse of such merit
that he was awarded first place
with a score of 7.90.

Dave Andrew and Dick Pribiin’

copped second and third in the
free exercise.

Frank Swift was the only other
Pitt gymnast on the rings to reach
a second place finish.

Third place finishes by Beatty
in sidehorse, Dave Andrew in
vaulting, Dick Pribis on the paral-
lel bars and Lilly on the hi-bar
were all Pitt could garner.

Phil Lilly summed up the meet

this way. “It is hard enough tot"?

ing to contend with the judges."
