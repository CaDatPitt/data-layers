Hotel May

Near Syria Mosque

The posibility of constructing a
hotel on the three-acre site behind
the Masonic Temple, 4227 Fifth
Ave., and the,Syria Mosque on
Bigelow Boulevard is being dis-

“: ' cussed by a leading Pittsburgh real

estate firm, according to an article
published in Tuesday‘s Pittsburgh
Press. '

Beynon Land Co., a subsidiary of
Beynon & Co. Realtors, has
obtained 99-year leases on the prop-
erty, which includes two parking
lots, and plans to develope the area,
confirmed William J. Beynon of
Beynin & Co., who obtained the
leases. V

The Syria Mosque lot is located
between Bigelow Boulevard, Bayard
Street and Lytton ‘Street. ‘ The
Masonic Temple-lot is surrounded
by Bayard Street and Tennyson
Street and is separated from the
Syria Mosque lot by Lytton Street.

The construction of a hotel is not

certain, however, as Beynon said 0

final plans for development will not
be announced until a later date.
Parking would _ be continued

“indeﬁnitely," Beynon said, adding

that “There will be plenty of ade- . ’

quate advance notice before that will
be discontinued, and a lot must be
done before it would be."' ‘

The land will be “more than

likely" developed as one large com-A _ 

plex as opposed to distinct sections,

“although at this time you couldn't.  i

say whether ‘it would be instantane-
ous, but it would all be developed,“
Beynon said. » ~-

Edward W. Sell, an attorney pa_r- .' 

ticipating in the lease negotiations
and a former dean of Pitt Law:
School, said he had “no idea" what-
would be developed on the property,

but commented that the year-long ' 

lease negotiations were.“complicat-.' I

ed.”

 

“When you’re developing some-f  

thing that's going to last_for 99 years, '*  ‘

you have all kinds» of problemsi,.§‘°'i'i’

about taxes and umpteen other

 

things you have to negotiate,"“said..  4.
Sell, presently an instructor at Pitt  I

Law School.

Sell said he did not know who I i

would benefit from development of 

the land. "

Researchers Find Pittsburgh Residents Optimistic

By GLENN FREUND.

Pitt News Staff Writer

“Pittsburgh residents rate high the

livablilityi of their neighborhoods,

and are more optimistic about them
than they were five years ago.
“The positive attitudes, revealed
in a recent city-wide survey,.show
that the city’s neighborhoods are
healthy and becoming stronger.”

These are the major conclusions
of a research project directed by Dr.
Roger S. "Ahlbrandt, .Ir., associate
professor in the School of Social

- Work, and sponsored jointly by the

School of Social Work and the Uni-
versity Center for Social and Urban
Research. The project was funded
by the National Institute for Mental
Health. ‘ ’ .
The telephone survey, conducted
last spring, contacted approxi-
mately 6,000 residents throughout
the city and asked questions about
their sense of community, about
local facility use, neighborhood con-
ditions, neighboring patterris, par-
ticipations in voluntary organiza-
tions, housing, 'public services,

' work, Hhealthlandisocialsuppioit sys.-,

tems‘ The individual results were

broken down into datasfor the 74~

neighborhoods throughout the city.
The final results of the research will

I be published in August, according to

Ahlbrandt.

Ahlbrandt compared the results
of this study with a similar though
much smaller study done in 1975
and published in the Pittsburgh
Neighborhood Atlas. ‘

“In general, every neighborhood

in the city is more positive now than ‘

they were in l975_in terms of higher

satisfaction levels, and people gener-V _

ally see the neighborhood as
improving to a greater extent than in
1975,” Ahlbrandt said. “This change
in attitudes led me to believe there's

a strength in the city. We’re stronger .

socially than in 1975. One thing
that’s happened has been the advent
of large ‘neighborhood-related
projects.”

Of all survey respondents, 72 per-
cent rated their neighborhoods a

indicated that 29 percent thought
their neighborhoods had improved
over the last two years, while 16 per-
cent-thought conditions had deterio-
rated. The rest felt it had stayed
about the same.

In the. 1975 survey, by compari-
son, only l3 percent thought their
neighborhoods were improving
while 49 percenfthought they were
declining. ' . ~ _

When asked about their percep-
tions of neighborhood conditions,
Pittsburghers -rated cost of housing,
litter and garbage, street mainte-
nance and stray dogs as the greatest

problems, in that order. Crime was V

also mentioned as a major problem,
but by only 15 percent of. the

they felt stronglyattached to their
neighborhoods. -
The level of attitudes rose and fell

from one neighborhood to the next, ‘

but _-respondents who rated their
eighborhoods less favorab1y_ also

reported that they thought the

neighborhood had improved.

In South Oakland, for example,
67 percent of respondents rated their
neighborhood a good or excellent"
place to live; in 1975, it was only 42
percent. About 29 percent said it had
improved, and 79 percent felt
strongly attached to it. Litter and
garbage and cost of housing were
listed as the major problems.- I

Another major indicator in the -
shift of "attitudes, according to Ahl-

brandt, is that fewer residents said

they planned to move out of the city;

-Ahlbrandt says the city,~w_hich.l_ost "

“There didn't seem to be an irior-is
dinate amount of dissatisfaction

_ with" the city, which I viewed‘ as‘a.

very healthy sign. In I975 a very high
number indicated they were going to
move to another city." 

Ahlbrandt said this study wasan
outgrowth of the seven or eightiyears‘
of research he had done in thearea
of neighborhoods.  at

“The 1975 study was an attempt_to,.«

The results showed that the key
factor is the social fabric of the
neighborhood. “This led me to
believe that neighborhoods with a
greater social fabric should be more
stable. In this study I wanted to
show a relationship between the
social support system of individuals
and their mental health and the
extent to which social support sys-
tems differed among neighbor-
hoods. I also wanted to relate social
support systems and their strengths
to neighborhood stability."

Ahlbrandt said social fabric,
therefore, is just as important to fed-
eral programs as throwing in bricks

and mortar, which he said have been
the basis of federal housing
programs.

“Hcretofore, most of the federal,
state and city programs haven‘t
looked at the social side of the neigh-
borhood. We're suggesting it’s the
interrelationship the people have
with each other in the neighborhood

be used for, I would assume that
would determine who’s going to
benefit by it," Sell said. “The reason
we did it was we thought a need to
get more income from the lot than
renting it as a parking lot.”

Beynon denied the report pub-
lished in the Pittsburgh Press that
likened the possible hotel “with a
convention center theme."

“No, we’re not considering that,”
Beynon replied in response to the
Press article. “If there‘s going to be a
hotel there, it would have no direct
connection with the convention

center."

that are important and that if local
government and HUD (Housing
and Urban Development) are
‘serious about preserving neighbor-
hoods they have to give some atten-
tion to the people living in them.

“One of the focuses of federal
housing policy should be making
resources available to local neigh-
borhood groups.” said Ahlbrandt.

Ahlbrandt added that a healthy
neighborhood doesn’t have to be a
wealthy one.

“You can have strong neighbor-
hoods that are fairly low income if
neighborhood institutions
(churches, shopping centers, health
facilities, neighborhood organiza-
tions, etc.) and the social fabric are
strong and vibrant, he said.

Pittsburgh, said Ahlbrant, “is
strong, and has a fundamentally
strong base which are its neighbor-
hoods. If it’s managed well, it can
remain a fairly strong, healthy city.”



Pittsburgh residents are ‘happy with their neighborhoods, .a recent study shows.

Pitt Plays George Washington In D.C.  

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pill News Sports Editor

The Panthers basketball team has
been an enigma thus far this season.
They have played like giant killers,
they have played like high schoolers
and they have played well in losing
efforts.

A look at the Panther record thus
far this season is a revealing one. Pitt
opened the season with two impres-
sivevictories, beating St. Francis at
home and St. Bonaventure in Oleon,
N.Y.

The win over the Bonnies in their
building was impressive because Pitt
totally dominated in winning by 17
points. Most teams leave Oleon los-
ers, nevermind blowing the home
team away.

Then the roof fell in. At the Show
'Me Classic in Missouri, Pitt entered
a prestigious field .which included

Missouri, Lamar and West Texas

State. Pitt had their chance to show
what they could do against nation-
ally known powers.

In the opening round. against
Lamar, the Panthers forgot how to
put the ball in the hoop and lost by

two,‘ although the game was not

really that close. In the consolation
game, West Texas State annilated
Pitt by 19 points. ,

Ever since then the Panthers have

had their problems. They’ve beaten .

teams like Massachusetts, Robert
Morris, Eastern Kentucky and Del-
aware State and lost to such teams as
Rutgers, James Madison and Virgi-
nia Tech. _

Pitt was able to defeat the Bonnies

for the second time this season by
displaying a good _shooting touch.
But the losses were a direct result of
a lack of offensive firepower.

Pitt’s shooting has been hot and
cold. Pitt has shot as well as 73 per-
cent in one half of play (against E.
Kentucky), and as poorly as 29 per-
cent (against Rutgers).

In the most recent game against
Rhode Island, a legitimate national
power, the Panthers played as well
as they have all season, for 37 min-
utes that is. Then they fell apart and
coundn’t score for the remaining
three minutes, including a 0-for-6

stretch from the foul line. Pitt lost

the game with one second remain-
ing, 62-60. '

Pitt’s next game is an Eastern
eight confrontation with seventh

‘ place George Washington. GW lost

their best player, Mike Zagado, to
graduation last year and just is not a
force to be considered. The Colon-
ials lost Wednesday night to a strong
Virginia team by .30 points.

George Washington has two play-
ers in the top ten in conference scor-
ing. Wibert Skipper (14.4) and
Randy Davis ( 14.4) are tied for ninth

place in the Eastern Eight scoring
' race. These two are expected to be

the people that Pitt will have to stop.

The Panthers also have two play-
ers in thetop ten in scoring. Sam
Clancy (15.6) and Carlton Neverson

(15.2) are fifth and sixth .respec--

tively. But what the Panthers need is
consistency. .
Somewhere in between the hot

~and cold.speI»ls_. Pitt m-ust find some .

consistancy for 40 -full minutes to be
considered" legitimate contenders in
the Eastern Eight. .

Men’s V'ball Team Opens

' By J.P. HOWARD
Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt men's volleyball team,
conference champion of a year ago,
opens its 1981 season with a ﬂurry
this weekend at home Saturday
against divisional foe George Mason
University, and Sunday at the Nit-
tany Lion Invitational at Penn
State. ,

Entering into only ‘its third year as
a varsity program, Pitt is already
considered one of the best teams in
the East. Last year, in head coach
Ray Reilly's initial season, the
Panthers vaulted from 9-21 in 1979
to an 8-0 conference record, and
No. 1 ranking in Divisionll of the
Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League (ECVL). Overall, Pitt ﬁn-

" ished with a No. 3 ranking in the

East.

In 1981, Pitt moves up to the Div-
ision I level, but despite the stiffer
competition, Reilly expects more of
thesuccess his squad achieved last
year. ‘

“With pretty much the same team
as last year’s, we should do just as
well,” said Reilly. “We’ve improved

since then and may have a chance to '

move_ up a spot in the Eastern
rankings.”
The majority of, last year’s roster

returns intact, with the notable
exception of two AIl—ECVL Div-
ision II performers, Jeff Beavers and
Don Hardin. \

Beavers, last season’s team cap-
tain and Most Valuable Player, has
graduated. Reilly said the Panthers
will miss the leadership he provided
the team.

Hardin, who as a freshman was
one of the most dominant middle
blockers in the_ East last year, has

‘transferred’ to Ohio State. In addi-
tion to his All-ECVL honors, the‘

6'4” Hardin was named first team
All-East in 1980 and his absence is
bound to hurt the Panther attack.
Seven Iettermen return to anchor
a young but experienced Pitt roster
this year, including sophomore
Dave Baird. 'Pitt’s third member of
the 1980 Al1—ECVL team. Reilly
regards Baird as “one of the best
setters in the East.” Baird is an
important part of the Panther 5-1
offense which basically relies on a
“set-it-up” attack with a lot of decep-
tion involved, according to Reilly.

Joining Baird=will be returning
regulars Brian Devine, Scott Rob-
bins, Dave Mitas, Jim Grant and

A Like Fixing
A Leaking Roof

With A Bucket

. Opinion

The new state“ law banning the sale of drug
paraphernalia is like the man who ﬁxes a leaky roof by
placing a bucket under it; both solutions miss the point
entirely. The bill was signed into law Dec.4 by Gov.
Thornburgh and will take effect Feb. 4. Specifically,
the law outlaws the sale or possession of rolling pap-
ers, hash pipes, roach clips, balloons, and every other
product “designed for use in planting...concealing,
injecting, ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing
into the human body a controlled substance.”

However, Alan Lee Carb, an attorney for Heads
Together, (a Squirrel Hill shop specializing in selling

paraphernalia) has challenged the law. ,_.

Carb’s basic argument against the new law is that
banningthe sale of drug paraphernalia would not cut
downion the use of marijuana and other drugs.

The law “...is an analogous to having outlawed‘

9

drinking glasses and coffee mugs during prohibition,’
Carb claims.

And, Heads Together manager Ed Abele reports

people are now stocking up on paraphernalia.
“People are coming in here and buying whole boxes

The obvious contradiction in the law is illustrated
by the fact that a smoker is legally prohibited from
buying a pipe in a record shop, but can purchase one in
a tobacco shop.

“There are all manner of things under heaven and
earth besides marajuana. I have a pipe I use to smoke
tobacco; I bought it here,” Abele said. “Under the law,
this pipe is illegal.”

Head store owners are claiming non-drug uses for
their products, and in most cases, the courts are agree-
ing. Federal court decisions have gone in favor of
head-shop owners in at least nine cases in the past. At
least someone has recognized the absurdity of the law
banning paraphernalia. .

Outlawing pipes, and papers, paraphernalia which
have obvious other uses than the smoking marijuana
or other drugs will have little or no effect on stopping
drug usage. Those who want such paraphernalia can
easily obtain it by driving out of state or through a mail
order purchase. .

If Gov. Thornburgh and other anti-drug factions
are actually sincere in their efforts to curb the use of
drugs, they would be pushing for tougher enforcement
of existing drug laws and stricter sentences for
offenders. ’

It is easy to see through Thornburgh’s attempt at
taking a hard stance against drugs with this Mickey
Mouse law banning drug paraphernalia.

It’s like the guy who puts a bucket under a leaky

Responsible Adult has Sobering Thought

I had an inkling of what it meant
to be an adult at an inglorious
moment, sitting on the toilet, out of
toilet paper. With clear insight, I
understood that all my life someone
had seen to it that full rolls of toilet
paperghad succeeded empty ones.
The adult, seeing what needed
doing, took responsibility without
being told by anyone else to do it.

In those terms, I've pondered
what a person should have done in
Nazi Germany. Suppose I knew that

. gas ovens were being produced, on

government contract, by a local
company, to be used against “unde-
sirables" who, in some way,jeopard-
ize national security. I could try my
best not to know. I could disapprove
and pay my taxes. I could write a
letter to the editor or to my congress-
person. I could refuse a job in the
factory, ortake one and make a fuss
from within. I could protest in front
of the factory, talk to the factory
owner, sit in the factory doorway.
Or I could try to interrupt the facto-
ry's production. I would be responsi-
ble for whatever course I chose.
We know that many Germans
said later they didn't know about the
gas ovens. Even high Nazi officials

Recently, my husband and I sold
our GE stock, explaining in a letter
that we objected to profiting for the
Mark I2 A nuclear warheads, which
are multiply mounted on American
missiles. These weapons, we said,
are the gas ovens of our time. I also
wrote a letter to a local man who sits
on GE's board, asking ifa concerned
group could see him. No, the latter
said: he was not responsible for talk-
ing to the public.

The investor relations man at GE,
whose job it is to talk to the public,
wrote that GE can do nothing: “your
objections to the manufacture of
military equipment can approp-
riately be addressed only to those
responsible for setting national
defense policy....” GE merely fills
orders, he said, though the nation's

fifth ‘largest military supplier has got .

rich filling such orders, is the
nation's fourth largest spender in
research and development, and
spends $l2l million a year to per-
suade the public that GE “brings
good things to life.“

There are over 50,000 nuclear
weapons, over a million Hiroshi-
mas, which means the equivalent of
three tons of radioactive TNT for
each of us on this earth. These wea-

is money that can’t be spent to feed
hungry people or cure their diseases
or even to repair bridges and
potholes. It's no good blaming the
Russians, for we've led every step of
the way.

The UN Comprehensive Study of,
dtermine technology, but vice versa.
Thus, greater accuracy in weapons
has led us to articulate a first strike
policy, according to which we‘d try
to get Russian missiles before they
could leave their silos. But it
wouldn’t do any good. No matter
how beautifully such an attack went,
they could still wipe us out with what
they had left. And ifthey hit first, we
could do the same.

The reliance on such insanity
teaches us that life isn't worth much.
Robert McNamara, as secretary of
defense, said that America" would
accept casualties up to about a quar-
ter ofour population. Herman Kahn
says we‘d be willing to lose between
ten and 60 million people in nuclear
war. lfthat‘s true, it neans we‘re wil-
ling to think of one another--even of
ourselves--as essentially worthless.‘
If we believe that, we can hardly
imagine ourselves responsible
adults.

The UN study concludesthat “it is ‘
imperative—.that statesmenand polit-e -

icat leaders accept their responsibil-
ity." But Helen Caldicott, the

pediatrician who believes that stop-‘

ping the arms race is “the ultimate in
preventive medicine," told protes-
ters gathered at the Pentagon last
December, “Your responsibility as
adults is to save the world."

It is a sobering thought. It is easier
to follow orders, to fill orders. And
there isn_’t much time left. The Bul-
letin of Atomic Scientists, in its Jan-
uary l98l issue, moved the minute

hand of its doomsday clock up to
four minutes to‘ midnight. But on the
other hand, this is our home. We live
here. We’d like‘ to go on living here,
working here, falling in love, raising
families, planning futures here.

I had .a liberated feeling, as Isat
there long ago on the toilet, thinking
about the toilet paper. I no longer

‘had to wait for—someone else to
change it, for I was a responsible
adult and could do it myself.

  Wrestlers Preparefor Kent State Meet

By BARRY BARTUSIAK'
Pitt News Sports Writer

After- losing twice last weekend,
the Pitt wrestlers get a chance to
redeem themselves this weekend at
the Kent State Wrestling Invita-
tional. The tournament displays a
new concept in collegiate wrestling
in which teams, rather than individ-
ual wrestlers, move into winner's or
loser’s brackets.

The Invitational, which will have
eight teams competing, features
NCAA powerhouses Auburn,
Clemson, and the host team Kent

State, as well as NAIA mainstay
Slippery Rock State College. Assis -
tant coach Coryea said that those
four schools will provide stiff com-
petition for the Panther grapplers.
Bowling Green, Pitt’s first opponent
in the tourney, is a team of similar
caliber to the Pitt squad and should
give the team a stern first round test.

Though the tournament is based
on a team concept, it will, nonethe-
less, provide a chance for individual
wrestlers to showcase their talents.
Several Pitt grapplers are expected
to do quite well. At ll8 lbs., Glenn

Maxwell, who sports a /-3 mark
thus far this season, is counted upon
to start the team'off in a winning
fashion.

Freshman Joe Throckmorton,
who wrestles in I26 lbs. division,
“has the most deceiving record on
the team," according to assistant
coach Coryea.

Though he only has a 4-5 record,
he has wrestled two All-Americas
and at least three other All-America
candidates. This weekend will prove
to be no different if the Panthers

meet up against Auburn, who pos-
sesses top-notch wrestler Tony Leo-
nino in the I26 lb. weight class.

Three other freshman wrestlers
are also expected to fare well in the
competition this weekend. Craig
Richey, at I34, has a 3-3 record so
far, and has been a pleasant surprise.
One hundred and fifty pounder Jeff
Jelic, who dropped his first match of
the season last weekend, has estab-
ished himself this season by owning
a 4-2 record. Dan Kasperkoski, the
heavywight wrestler on the team,

has made his presence felt by pos-
sessing a 7-5 slate.

When asked for a prediction for
the team’s finish this weekend assist-

team “ had a good week of practice
and if everything goes right...we
could possibly end up as one of the
top four teams."

To be in the top four may not
sound like much of an accomplish-
ment to the people who follow the
football team. but to a team that had
a poor 3-I3-l dual meet record last
season it means very much.

Men Meet
Owls

By SEAN BARNES
Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt Panthers travel today to
Philadelphia to open with the first of
a two meet weekend. This afternoon
at 4 p.m., the men from Pitt will
stack their swimming talent against
the Owls from Temple. This will be
the first time in years that these two
teams have encountered each other.
The Panthers will enter the meet well
prepared after their recent victory
over Penn State here at Pitt last
weekend.

Panther head coach Fred Lewis is
glad to have his starting backstroker

Geoff Emore back in the water, but
strep throat, ear infection, and the
flu are hurting four other starting
Panthers. But tonight's meet should
still fall to Pitt’s faction due both to
Pitt’s depth and the help of their
outstanding divers.

The second meet on Saturday
against LaSalIe will prove to be a
tougher contest than the Temple
meet. LaSalIe has good depth, which
won them the Atlantic Conference
title last year.

“They have good freestyle sprin-
ters and high caliber backstroker,”
said coach Lewis. “But you have to
remember who we have.” _

The diving in both meets should
be easily secured by Pitt’s nationally

ranked diving team under head

  

coach Julian Krug. Both LaSaIle
and Temple have no nationally
ranked divers. '
The next home meet for the
Panthers will be the last home meet
for graduating seniors. The meet will
be held next Saturday, Jan. 31 start-
ing at l p.m. at Trees pool against
the Mountaineers from West Virgi-

Women Meet
Terps

coach Dick Bradshaw, journey to
Maryland for their meet against the"

Terps tomorrow. The Terps enter
the meet with only one loss, which
occurred last week against N.C.
State. The women from Pitt will go
into Saturday’s meet with the advan-
tage of last week’s devastating win
over Penn State, ‘I 1 1-29.

Bradshaw chose the mixed format
for the meet, with emphasis on the
longer events where Pitt is so strong.
“The ‘pool isslower than ours, but
we're still looking for individual per-
formance for Eastern qualifying
times so we don‘t have to worry
about times,” said Bradshaw, “just

spanned events such as the construction of
the Civil War ironclad. Merrimac in 1861-62,
right up to the repair and maintenance of to-
day's modern nuclear powered aircraft carriers

ships but we remain unequalled in our ability to

- Reilly said the Panthers goal at
the Nittany Lion Invitational on
Sunday is to make the finals, where
he expects Penn State to be waiting.
This year's field at the tournament is
not particularly strong, according to
Reilly, with the exception of the
Lions. Other participants ‘include
Penn, Western Ontario, and a few

other Canadian teams.
Pitt’s switch from Division II to

Division 1 status this season puts_the

third—year program in a conference
with a more established and higher
level of competition. The -Panthers
were voted into the division in light
of their impressive I980 showing in
match and tournament play against
both Division I and Division II
schools. Many of this year’s div-
isional foes were on the Panther
schedule last se/ason, so the adjust-
ment should not be a major factor.

Reilly expects perennial Eastern '

powerhouse Rutgers-Newark to win
the conference again this year, with
last year’s No. 2 team, Penn State,
having a good shot to repeat its posi-
tion.. Both teams were the only
opponents to dominate.Pitt during
the 1980 season, but Reilly isn't
completely counting. out the Panth-S‘
er’s chances to overtake Penn State.
Last year, Pitt was one of only two
teams to defeat the Nittany Lions at)
the ECVL Championships. The
other teams was Rutgers-Newark,
which went on to finish third in the
nation. .
