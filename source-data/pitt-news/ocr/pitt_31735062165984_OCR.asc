The Two-Ocean War

By MATTHEW SWETONI C

The American reading pub-
lic must be fast coming to pre-
fer condensations rather than
the real article. N 0 other rea-
son could serve to explain
Samuel Eliot Morrison’s cour-
ageous attempt to boil down his
nationality acclaimed 15 volume
History of United States Naval
Operations in World War II into
a one volume article which still
retains the clarity and depth of
the original work.

. The effort, modestly entitled
"The Two’-Ocean War (Little,
Brown & C0,, 611 pages, $12.50)

J turns out to be nothing more than

a mere survey of those events
which made‘ the United States
Navy top dog at sea by the end
of the war.

His attempt at condensation is
like trying to squeeze" a hippo-
potamus into a ‘bathtub. He had
simply much too much material
to work with and no matter how
tightly he attempted to tie to-
gether the events he selected to
emphasize, there always ‘seems to
be a certain something hovering
out of sight above the pages, and
that something is the true story
of the war which Morrison is try-
ing to describe.

Honest Admittal

Morrison quite honestly admits
in the preface to the book that he
has been forced to omit “many
minor actions, convoy struggles
and air clashes in the ‘central
blue,? in wh_ich sailors fought and
What he has selected to
omit, therefore, are those events
which made his longer work a
monument to hisname, for what
is war but the struggles and
deaths of individual men.

For example, in his half-
chapter on the capture of the
Gilberts and Marshalls in late.
1943 and early 1944, Morrison
devotes a whole 22 pages to a

campaign which required an en-
tire bok in the original version.
His condensed version of the
bitter ﬁght for Tarawa atoll
covers less than half a page.

»' There is none of the brutality

and "heroism in his story, it is
dead, utterly without feeling,
completely void of the real sig-
niﬁcance of the events he is
describing. ‘
Some admirers of the-famous
historian might argue that this
latest book is meant as a primer
for those completely ignorant Of
the causes, results, and events of
the war at sea, or that the reading
public has demanded a conden-
sation such as this one.
Others Just As Good
This, however, is pure blah.
There are a number of ﬁne one
and two volume histories of the
war at sea just as complete and
just as well thought out as this
one. Sea Power, editedyvby Ches-
ter Nimitz, is one of them.
Another argument in favor of

' the book might be that such a

history would show the entire
picture of the war and not just
a small portion at a time as
was done in the 15 volume set.
This, however, would require
meticulous care in the presenta-
tion of the condensation and yet
the book appears to have been
thrown together with the tender
care of a chimpanzee sloshing wa-
ter colors on a canvas.
Warns Reader
When Morrison begins his tale
of the tragic battle of the Java
Sea he warns the reader before-
hand that the movements of the
ﬂeets ‘are rather confusing and
that he might as well skip that
part of the book entirely and -go
onto the next section. That surely
doesn’t sound like a man who has

labored painstakinglyto make his ‘

book into a clear picture of the
war. _

.The same is even true of the
numerous charts and maps

better make your Allegheny reservation early . . . if you aim to get
- home fast. Come vacation, who wants to stay after school? Take the
Allegheny high road out of here (it's a surprisingly low road In cost).
And, if you have doting parents coming to Commencement . . . or a
dance date due from afar. . . we’ll be glad to escort them hither and
thither in style. It's the swifty, thrifty way to travel . . . especially Ill
groups or on Saturdays and Sundays, when our fares are fairly

irresistible.

which Morrison has placed in
the new volume. It does not
seem to mater to him that in
many instances the charts print-
ed are barely mentioned in the
text, _or in other instances maps
are used which bear no direct
relationship to the matter being
discussed but only a superﬁcial
one to a general situation which
has been condensed right out
of the book.
Direct Address
In his discussion of the above
mentioned Tarawa campaign for
example, Morrison plasters a full
page map of the island in his
book to accompany the half-pa-ge
of text which goes with it.
Morrison also employs the tech-
nique of direct address when he
is faced with a situation which
requires more documentation than
the condensation has given him
the room to deliver.

The presentation of the book
is faulty in other respects also.
Morrison is forced to make snap
judgements of personalities
which much more debate than
he is permited to give them and
as a result we are forced to ac-
cept his un-substantiated state-
ments that certain fellows are

—good admirals and others are

not ﬁt to captain .a garbage
scow.

All in all, this condensation
must be regarded as a poor at-
tempt at what is virtually an im-
possible task, and I, together with
most of Morrison’s fans, would
have been much happier if he had
not taken on the job.

Last weekend's vist of the

a number of

ments as a

What this means in terms of

To Kill orNot to Kill 1 ~

Recently," the state of New York abandoned
the statute-based mandatory death sentence for
convictions ofgﬁrst-degree or pre-meditated mur-
der; and, more recently, California's governor, Pat
Brown commuted gas-chamber
executions to life imprison-
ment for three men.

In and of themselves, these
two acts are not revolutionary
or unheard of. What is remark-
able, however, is that New‘
York is the last state in the
Union to do away with the

Pat Brown had refused in 1960
to commute the cyanide-sen-
tece of Caryl Chessman.

This does not mean an end to capital punish-

,ment in the United States. In" fact, 43 states still

provide for the death penalty in ﬁrst degree
murder cases, seven by hanging, one by hanging
or shooting, 11 by lethal gas and 24 by electrocu-
tion. But these sentences are not mandatory.~ Only
Alaska. Hawaii. Maine, Michigan,
North Dakota, Rhode Island and Wisconsin de-
signates a punishment of life imprisonment for
capital offenses.

In the old days, of course, punishment was '

much more severe throughout the criminal code
than it is today. If someone were accused and
convicted of burglary, deﬁned as breaking and
entering the dwelling of another with intent to

‘rob during the night, he ‘could be, and usually

was, hanged. If he stole a chicken or a cow, he
was hanged. If he picked a pocket, ‘hanged. If he
proached game on a nobleman’s property - you
guessed it. , '
Conscience‘-Pricked Judges

As a result, judges tended to be ‘very lenient in

regard to minor felonies. A defendent could win

his case by stating that the sun had, not quite
gone down below the horizon at the time of the
crime, even though he admitted breaking and
entering" the dwelling place of another and did
indeed steal six pounds sterlingfrom the cookie
jar.

This seems to be the trend, in a more sophis-
ticated way, in the United States. Most’ states

‘refuse to do away with capital punishment entire-

ly, but they leave the ultimate decision up to the

judge and jury. Few jurymen and judges, thought

 

Minnesota, '

By Stan Stein

they profess a belief in the ultimate good of
capital punishment, will when the situation ac-
tually arises, condemn another , man to death.
The power over life and death is somehow re-
pellent to most people.

But this is not really the main reason. It does
not seem attributable to anything in particular ,

except the collective conscience of a nation. "' ‘

There have been in history, four major justi-
ﬁcations for capital punishment. One is the bib-
lical “an eye for an eye.” The second is that the
state should not have to pay taxpayers money to
keep a ﬁrst—degree murdered alive. Third, per-
haps most widely relied upon, is that a penalty of
death acts as a deterrent to potential murderers.
And fourth, that the state has the moral right and

‘obligation to take a life in retribution for an-

other unlawfully taken.

Bad Basis For Living 

I have always been taught that an “eye for an
eye” polcy is an infantile basis to run my life, and
I have learned that people think very little about
the consequence of an act. Those who do not think
either will be deterred by threat of life imprison-
ment as . well as capital punishment or, if not
deterred by life imprisonment, will not be deter-
red by the ,_ electric chair.

I have also noticed, and this is possiblythe

strongest argument against capital punishment, is

that those people who argue against the death"

penalty will also argue in favor of euthanasia.
The feeling is that the state contradicts itself

by taking a life for a crime committed and at the

same time prohibiting the taking of a life to end

, extreme anguish andlsuffering. The theory behind

prohibiting mercy killing is that while there is
life there is hope, and miracles can happen. The
supposed terminal case might live, miraculously,
and resume a normal productive life. - _

V More previously hardened criminals, however,
have been mentally and psychologically rehabilii?-/‘
tated and have resumed normal and productive

”as incurable, terminal cases.

as insurable, terminal cases. i

It makes moresense to me to tr and work
with a healthy and rational criminal (for if he
weren’t rationalhe would not have been allowed
to stand trial in the first place) in the area. of
psychological and emotional therapy than to shop
for miracles. T v M . -

N_o ‘retailer would touch the stuff. There were
two many complaints from housewives whose

husbands didn’t relish pink dress shirts. The

material itself was always pockmarked with pul-
led threads and barren areas.

But along came’ an ingenious copy writer who
attached an expanatory card to all madras items.

In’ big diabolical letters, appropriately printed
in -red ink, the message reads: GUARANTEED TO
BLEED. Below this, the fine print asks you to
“note the inperfections in the cloth, true signs
of genuine Indian madras.”

A Shirt With Hemophilia

A short while ago I saw a handsome-1ooki_ng .

madras shirt in the window of the University
Shop, and wanted to buy it, despite its prohibitive
cost of $7.95.

When I later took the twenty pins from the
folded shirt,’ I discovered a “run” smack across
the pocket, which guaranteed an air-cooled chest-
for the rest of the summer. ‘

I dashed back to the University _Shop and
questioned the ethics, of manager Jay McKenzie,
who could double for" a Mississippi riverboat ~

“Jay, I didn’t think you’d. stoop to: selling
stuff with holes in it,” I began. _

“What!” _MacKenzie squealed in disbelief. “Do
you know that a true madras lover would go nuts
over this?” , ’

"‘Yeh, but; my «mother is not a true madras
lover,” .I explained, “and I know she’1l go nuts

over this. _..r .‘

“Just give me an" imperfected madras shirt,
willya Jay?” ‘_

_“What do you mean?” MacKenzie blurted.

“One without any imperfections,” I replied;

MacKenzie got desperate and instructed his
assistant to procure a madras sport coat in the’
back room, “the one that’s causing a st-ir among
college kids.”

Soon MacKenzie’s lackey appeared with a
blue madras ‘jacket draped across his arms.‘ Jays"
fumbled with it awhile, ﬁnally ﬁnding a gaping
hole in the elbow. “See!” MacKenzie noted. “This.

  ‘Long Day’s ‘Journey lnto Night’

Long Day's Journey Into Night, or one day in the life

Written with Love

But it is also a story of love. It
is a play by a man who could re-
member with great personal grief
the degeneration of the three peo-
ple who were his parents and
brother, and yet who could also
forgive them for what they had

done.
\

There is not a character in
the play _who does not elicit
sympathy, a sympathy which
0’Neill must have consciously

wanted to be a fundamental
motive of the drama.

It is this motivation which
makes his father’s miserly habits
seem ludicrous, and his brothers
alcoholic ravings pit_iable. In the

"same light, however, he could not 
escape from the tragedy of truth. '

His father was a miser as was his
‘brother an alcoholic and although
the play forgives them, there still
remains the enigma of degenera-
tion which their faults bring out.

And therein lies the power of
the movie. All of these motives

(Editor’s Note: This is the first
in a series of three features on
faculty opinion about ﬁnals’
week.)

By NANCY DELANEY

Should ﬁnals’
abolished? “Yes,” "answered a
few of the faculty members
interviewed last week. To
these professors, the common

justiﬁcations for ﬁnals’ week-

are ‘either weak or invalid.

, Despite the usual argument that
ﬁnals motivate the student to or-
ganize and integrate his under-
standing of the term’s work and

that a ﬁnals’ week allows. him 

time to devote his time entirely 
to this review, a small number of 
professors feel that the trimester ,

plan would be improved if ﬁnals’
week were eliminated. ,

“Finals’ week makes a farce of
studying,_” one professor in the
division of the humanities who
wishes to remain anonymous says.
He cuts at the very basis of the
system in charging, “It is incred-
ible to think you could cram into
one week exams and reviews for

To avoid students cramming for
ﬁnal examinations and to encour-
age studying throughout the en-
tire term, some faculty members
like Dr. B. L. Cohen, professor of
Physics, would rather eliminate

is already so short that little is
accomplished by a ﬁnal exami-
nation. There is no need to su_m

ter, he argues. ’
The time devoted to ﬁnals’

ing, would be more beneﬁcial if it

that the one week cut off the tri-

In addition, the common prac-
tice of giving ﬁnal tests early ad-

ﬁrm action by the administration

‘to counter the idiosyncracies of

the faculty, in this area.

This particular professor feels
that the drawbacks in the ﬁnals’
week system persist because the
administration is! “lethargic and
uninterested in the matter.”

with the views of faculty mem-
bers who would like to extend

Sage Remarks
By Bob Smizik

Sports Editor

 

The hopes of the baseball team received a death—like blow
last week. It wasn’t the loss to West Virginia _that might
prove fatal, although that one hurt, rather it was the loss of
second baseman Ron Supansic for the season. ' ,

Supansic’s departure falls under the heading of an aca-
demic casualty. There has not been much said about it be-
cause some maneuvering was going on behind the scenes to
save Supansic. None of them worked.

Supansic did not have the normal academic trouble
that plagues many students. He had two things going
against him, and both of them were a little out of the
ordinary. '

Supansic’s original problem came when it was discovered
he could not_get into the school of Liberal Arts.

He, of course, was originally in Liberal Arts, but had to
drop out and go into the school of General Studies when he
decided to take some night courses as a part time student
during the fall trimester.
More Waiting

. When the time came around to re-apply to Liberal Arts
in December Supansic’ was told to wait until April and see
how his grades were. .

He pulled a 2.0 quality point average during "the Winter
trimester and went optimistically to see the powers—that-be in
Liberal Arts. C . _, ,

But once again he was rebuffed. Therewere a lot of
technical reasons that they stated, but the fact remains
that Supansic had an overall QPA of 2.2. Lewis and
Supansic did a lot of talking but it didn’t do any good.
Supansic was a man without aschool.

That is why Supansic sat out the‘ Slippery Rock and

Westminster games under, the guise of a sore arm. Lewis was‘

seeing what he could do to get Supansic into another school.
~ In the meantime Supansic had to sit and watch on’ the
bench. i A

Supansic ﬁnally found a home in the school of education
on May 6th. This was ideal since he intended to major in
Physical Education anyhow. ’ _ ’

That same afternoon Lewis started him against Alle-
gheny. He played one inning when a messenger of gloom, in
the person of Athletic. Director Frank Carver, came along
to spell real disaster for Supansic and the baseball team.
Carver had no choice in the matter. Supansic did not have
enough credits over the last threetrimesters tobe eligible
for varsity competition. Lewis had no choice either. .He im-
mediately pulled Supansic from the game. This time he said
it was because of a pulled muscle.

No Loopholes _. _ _

, But -there was no getting around Carver’s edict. Supan-
sic is out for the season. He will remain inschool this summer
and be around to play next year. ' ,

But that ‘is not helping‘ Lewis this year. Lewis was sick
about the whole matter. He realized that rules are rules, but
it’s hard to take something‘ like that philosophically. Supan-
sic came out of nowhere lasteyear, as a sophomore, to lead
the team in batting. That wasn’t all. He was .a standout lead
off batter, a valuable defensive man and one of the spark-
plugs of the team. . p _ '

To make matters worse, Lewis has only one reserve
inﬁelder, Jim Yedlicka. Yedlicka’ is a ‘capable hitter, but
is nowhere near Supansic in the ﬁeld. He has a bad knee
which slows him down and a not too strong arm that
hinders him getting the runner or a close play.

Lewis can move third-baseman Paul Martha over to

second and use Yedlicka at third. “Paul is so good. at third
base, I hate to move him over to second,” Lewis said. He has
other choices, but none are to bright. Some of them are
desperate. '
Cufhberf Could Come In V /

Lewis has one other resort. That is to bring Corky Cuth—
bert, the team’s leading hitter, in from right ﬁeld to take

' over second base.‘ Cuthbert played second base as a sopho-

more and part of lastyear.‘ But Lewis will also run into
trouble if he makes that change.

Cuthbert does not have one bad knee — he has two.
_“There is a much greater chance of Corky hurting his
knee in the inﬁeld than thereis in the outﬁeld,” ‘Lewis
said. “I don’t know whether it’s worth -it to take the
chance on Corky’s knees._” Lewis also feels that the
switch of Cuthbert to the inﬁeld mighthurt his hitting
and that could prove disastrous.

No matter whatfchanges are made, as Lewis says, “It’s
going to mess up our inﬁeld ‘defensively. I thought the inﬁeld
was going to be one of our strong points this year,” he said,
“but now I don’t know.”

With the toughest part of the-schedule in front of them,

Lewis will have ..to come upwith a successful answer to the
Supansic riddle if _the»_Panthers are to make the NCAA pljay-C
tiff

Tomorrow afternoon’s opponent

tomorrow, their chancespof attain-
ing a victory willbe dimmed even
further; Only West Virginia and
Penn'State remain on the sched-
ule and the Mountaineers» have
already defeated Pitt once this
season. —
Get Week Off
Following the West Virginia
meet Saturday, -the Panthers will
have a week off before the ﬁnal

‘ againstljenn State. This will rep-

resent the longest rest of the
month-long season and the ‘extra
practice could prove to be helpful.
The Mountie match will be
, only the second home meet of
‘the year. It will be played on
the‘ Ca_rnegie Tech campus-
where earlier the‘ Panthers suf-'
fered an 8 to 1 loss to Ohio
University.

Coach Ben Pope fears that the
Mountaineers will once again be
too strong. He stated, “I don’t
think we’ll lose‘ as badly as before.
The score should be 6-3 instead of
8-1.,Our best chance for a victory
should come against Penn State.”

Pope feels that the trimester is
hurting the sport. He said. “The
boys are forced to miss a lot of
classes.’ Then they have to study
extra hard. We have a lot of good
students but they’re not the type
of athletes that make great tennis
players.”

Dave O’Loughlin, the team’s

Play Navy Friday; Vie  

With Lions

By MARV ZELKOWITZ

The baseball team travels to Annapolis and Penn State;
Friday and Saturday for the three games that could deter ‘
mine if.the Panthers ‘go to the NCAA playoffs this season
They play a single game with Navy Friday and a double 5"
header with the Nittany Lions Saturday at University Park ‘ \

-Bobby Lewis feels that this weekend’s games will deter-

mine wether the Panthers get a
bid or not. “The way I see it,
we’ll have to win two out of three
to qualify,” he said. “It’s going to
be rough, though,” he continued.

“Both teams are real’ good. They .'

always are.” _

Penn State might be considered
the New York Yankees of Section
II ‘of the NCAA. They have been
in the Section II playoffs nine
times in the past thirteen years.
However, they have only won the
playoffs three times. In national
competition,Athe Lions have placed
second once, and fourth twice.

Strong Hitters

Penn State has two strong hit-
ters, according to their coach,
Chuck Medlar. “Dick Anderson
and Fred Light are both real good

1. hitters,” he said.

Anderson is State’s team cap-
tain and right ﬁelder. Despite
a .250 batting average, he led
the team in runs batted in last
year, with 13. Anderson also
lettered in _football, where he
plays end.

Light is as strong on defense
as offense, according to Medlar.
Last year, the shortstop batted
.294 with two home runs, but
only four runs batted in. He also
hit two doubles.

' Face Fenton

.The Panthers will deﬁnitely
face Bob Fenton in one game, but
as ‘of now, Medlar is undecided
as to who he will pitch in the
‘second game. Fenton is 7-0, and
has carried the bulk of the Lions’
pitching. Penn State’s overall
record is 9-2.

Fenton also has-a no-hitter to
his credit. He blanked Cornell,
17-0, _in‘ an eight inning game.
He faced 26 men and had 11
strike outs.

John Ciofﬁ recalls batting
against Fenton as a sophomore.
“He’s not real fast,” the Panther
first baseman said, “but he’s smart.
He doesn't let you hit him. He

puts the ball right in on the hands

so you can’t hit him.”
Good Record

_ Last year, Penn ‘State was 10-4,
and Fenton was 8-2. "He had a
1.42 earned run average and 70
strike outs in-77 -innings. Fenton
pitched in 12 of the‘ Lions’ 14
games. ‘
Fenton will face either John
Carlisle or Roger Johnson.
Carlisle has a 0.75 earned run
average for 36 innings of pitch-
inggoing into yesterday’s game.
He had‘ 64 strike"out,s, and had
won four games without a loss.
He had yielded only three
earned runs this season.
Johnson is relatively inexperi-
enced in college baseball. He_has_
pitched only eight innings thus
far, including a six inning stint
against West- Virginia, where he
gave up only one run.
Four Possibilities’
Medlar is undecided about his

, starting assignment for the sec-

ond game. “I [could go with any
one of four pitchers,” he said.
“Richard Noe has two wins, and
Dick Stellman, Walt Bloom-, and
Jeff Spanier are all good pitch-
ers.”

Last year, Noe, Spanier, and
Stellman pitched a total of
eighteen innings, yielding ﬁve
runs, and losing one game,
while winning none.

By FRANK Sl\IIZIK

The Panther track team is
preparing to send some of
their heavy artillery against
the Navy ﬂeet Saturday.
After losing to Penn State last
Week Coach Carl Rees is plan-
ning some new maneuvers in
order to get his team back on the

V track against the Middies.

The Midshipmen seem strong. in
all the events that the Panthers
excel, therefore much of the
Panthers success will depend on
their performances in the distance
races.

Coach Rees has been a little

disappointed in his distance men
so far this season. “I might have
to use John Bailey in both the
mile and two mile races, but

against Army he’ couldn't do
both,” said Rees.
Carter in Half Mile

Another change Rees was con-
templating was running Vance
Carter in the half mile. Carter is
the Panther’s best quartermiler.
However, he did compete in the
half mile last year. The other
Panther half miler should be Rich
Cook, whose best this year has
been a third in the triangular
meet against West Virginia and
Syracuse.

Rees may insert Jim Stud-
nicki because of his showing on —
Saturday. “He (Studnicki) has
been runningly badly all year,
but after his showing against
Penn State I may use him again
on the relay team,” said Rees.

No other changes will be made
in the Panther lineup. The sprint-

run better times than he did on
Saturday but he just hasn’t had a
.ﬁrst.” _ «
Tough Opponent

Del Vecchio’s toughest oppon-

is the Middies’ top sprinter. He
and Del Vecchio, according to
former times, are closely matched.
Joe Friend will also have his
toughest competition of the sea-
son when he meets Bill Gray.
Gray has done the 120-yard
high hurdles in 14.2. Friend will
probably have to top his best
time of this year, 14.6, if he is
to beat Gray. '

Friend will also have to give
his supreme effort in the broad
jump. John Thorell of Navy has
jumped over 24 feet. Gray is also
Navy’s top man in the 440-yard
intermediate hurdles, but the
Panthers still have a good chance
to take two of the three places in
the hurdles with Jack Whiteford
and Friend.

High Jump Close
The high jump is another toss-

up as Whiteford could win if he

is able to reach his peak form.

Against Penn State he just barely
tipped the bar at 6 feet 2 inches.
If he is able to reach that height
against Navy he should be able to
take first place.
Al Thomassey will also have
his hands full with the Mid-
shipmen, especially in the shot
put. Joe Berkowitz, from Navy,
has tossed the shot over 5'7 feet
while Thomassey’s best has
been 52 feet. Thomassey should
run away with the discus event,
though, for he had a throw of
165 feet against Pesn State, his
best of the season. _
Coach Rees sums up his teams
chances this way, “We should win
the 440-yard run, the two mile,
and possible the mile if Bailey
can come through for us in both
events, but there are so many
toss-ups that the meet could go
either way.”

Tumin Points in Penn State
3 .  

Meet Contemplatcd by Rees»

Coach Carl Rees is still trying

to ﬁgure out how his track team
lost to Penn State last Saturday.
“We were so close and all we had
to do was pick up a couple of
points here and there,” Rees

said.” “But I guess if Penn State"

lost they could have said the same
thing,” said Rees.

“It seems that the ﬁfteen points
we lost by were a lot, but actually
in a dual meet that only means
we lost by seven and a half points
because the points we lose they
get,” explained Rees.

Rees also pointed out several
instances where the Panthers
should have or might have
picked up points. “When Joe

Friend fell down, John White-
ford, who is Joe’s real good
buddy, might have been affected
for he was in a position to see
Joe fall. Otherwise it is entirely
possible that Jack might have
ﬁnished second instead of
third,” he said.

If Friend had not fallen the
Panthers might have been in a
better position to take the mile
relay. As it was they were out of
the meet when the mile relay was
run’ and it did not mean that
much to the team.

According to Rees, “We lost a
point in the javelin when Mort
Stanﬁeld committed a silly foul
and therefore lost third place.

Roger Johnson Ready
To Start Against Lions

Roger» Johnson told baseball coach Bobby Lewis at the
beginning of the season that he wanted to pitch, and pitch
regularly. This Saturday, Johnson will get his wish. . He is
scheduled to pitch the nine inning game against Penn-State at

University Park.

“I told coach that I wanted to

the West Virginia game, I had
only pitched about three innings.”
Johnson earned the right to pitch
against Penn State by holding
West Virginia to one run‘ in the
ﬁve-and two-thirds innings he
pitched.

Johnson sat ‘out most of last
season with a knee injury, but
pitched in the South Hills Base-
ball League in the summer.

“Mostly, I pitched to impress, the

coach,” he said._ “I _thought__l’d
get a better chance of pitching

this year if he saw me pitch in

the .lea-gue._’’ ‘ V
Saturdaymay prove that John-
son’s efforts were not in-~.vain.
Pitches No-Hitter

He won eleven games‘ while
losing two in the -South‘ ,1-Iillsr

League last ‘year. He pitched sev-
eral one-hitters and a. nc--'-hitter. ,
Johnson. has seen little‘ action
this ye‘:ar,.having started no games,
and pitched ,a ‘ total of eight in-
nings thus far. His record is ,1-0,
and he yielded but two runs.
Johnson has a variety __of
pitches and deliveries. “I like
to ‘mix them up,” he explained."
When ‘my fastball isn’t; live, I
have Na." couple of other ‘pitches
I can use. I have a ichange-up
curve, and a hard curve that
acts like a roumlhouse curve.”
If I’m really having trouble-,

I can use tokeep the hitters‘ off

balance, I have a no-windup de-

li'very,,a double pump, and a few

others,” he ‘said. _ _ '

Johnson is looking forward to

Jim Yedlicka explained his atti-

tude. “Some guys don’t mind sit- T
‘ting ‘on the bench, 1 but Rogerﬂ.
wants to pitch every ball game. -'
He’d probably do it if he got the"‘_

chance, too.”r

Johnson feels his only -prioblemk’

might he his ‘control. "‘That will
probably be my biggest problem,”

he said‘. “But, if I pitch regularly;

I’ll have that pinpoint contro ‘.” »

The righthander summed up his , -

feelings. “I’ve always wanted'to

pitch against Penn State. This is

my big break.”

Station W7PCH to Broadcast
Four Panther Baseball Games

Campus radio station- WPGH
has announced that it will an-
nounce four .Panther baseball
games next- week. All of the
"games will be played at Forbes

The games that will be broad-
cast are probably the_ most im-
portant of the year for the base-
ball team. Next Tuesday’s game
with West Virginia will be the
first game to "be aired. The Moun-
taineers are the only team to hold
a win over‘ the Panthers this year.

The next day“ the Pitt-Du-
quesne game will be broadcast.

The Panthers already hold a,

6-0 win overvthe Dukes. In that
‘game John Carlisle, the ace of

the Panther staff, pitched only

the second no-hit game in Pitt-

‘ WPGH the use of its broadcasting

baseball history.

Panther-Kent State doubleheader
will be broadcast. ‘
WPGI-I General Manager Jim
Kleinberg said, “We are broad-
casting the games because We feel
that the baseball team has gen-
erated enough interest in the
school so that we feel there» will
be students that .will want to
listen to the games.”
Kleinberg also announced that
Barry vweiser, the station’s
Sports director will handle the

another announcer yet to be
named.
Radio station KDKA has given

facilities for the games.

9Rothman
Denies Mag
Alffiliatioii

Irving N. Rothman, director of
student publications, stated last
"Monday that ‘although the quotes
attributed to him in the May 13
issue of The-Pitt News concerning
the establishment of a humor
-: ’magazine on campus expressed
his general feelings on the matter,
he never actually voiced those
sentiments to any staff member of
‘the paper. i

According to Rothman, the rea-
son why the administration has
not as yet approved the project is
because it probably doesn’t know
anything about the idea.

The magazine, to be edited by
Nelson Eisman under the spon-
sorship of Men’s Council, is sup-
posed to contain satirical men’s
humor on a college vein.

'Rothman, who denies any

professional aﬂiliation with the
project at this time, stated that
Eisman and Jerry Epstein, pres-
ident of MC, approached him
with their idea a number of
weeks’ ago and that he told
’them at that time that he would
be happy to give them some ad-
vice if they would show him a
few samples of the type of sa-
tirical humor which they de-
sired to place in the magazine.

The group, however, had no‘
samples available to show him
and, according to Rothman, that
was the last time he had any
contact with the project until the
article in The Pitt News linked
him with the group.

Musical Revue

arms Weekend

The Pittsburgh Playhouse will
present an original musical revue
‘Saturday in the Hamlet Street
Theater for the first time in three
years. “Make a Note of It" is the
title of the series of sketches,
blackouts, and song and dance
routines.

Fred Burleigh is directing the
production. June Reizner has
written both music and lyrics.

Original revues at the Play-
house in the past have developed
material then injected into Broad-
way hit shows. Others have
moved intact‘ to be smash hits on
Broadway.

“You never know aobut these
shows,” Burleigh has said, “until
they get onstage. And then you
never know until audiences begin
to react. Producing an original re-
vue is a pretty exciting gamble.”

‘ “It is incumbent upon us to
provide operators for sound,

Engel urged any University
