Pitt partakes in recycling programfitt.     ,      
  

by Jen Hirsch
For The Pitt Ncwa

Pitt will battle Arizona for
more than just the Super Bowl
this year.

Pitt is one of an estimated
500 colleges competing in Recy-
cleMania, a 10-week contest in
which colleges and universities
compete against each other to
increase recycling and promote
waste reduction activities on cam-
pus.

The contest began this past
weekend and will run through
March 28.

Pitt will compete for the ﬁrst
time this year since the event’s
2001 inception, although it has
had a recycling program’ since
1990, ‘said \William Mitchell, cam-
pus coordinator for RecycleMa-

I113.

Competing schools are sepa-
rated into two divisions: a compe-
tition division and a benchmark

division.

. Pitt has registered as a bench-
mark school, meaning it can track
its weekly progress and have ac-

65

Only a certain percentage

of students will respond
to Earth protection. But a
certain percentage also has a
built-in ‘competitive spirit.

Cooley

cess to all RecycleMania resourc-
es, but will not be included in of-
ficial rankings. '

Alec Cooley, a program man-
ager for the RecycleMania nation-
al program, explained why Pitt
chose to compete in the bench-
mark division.

“The benchmark_ division was
created to be more inclusive and
let ﬁrst—year participants dip their

toes in the water,” he said. “In the
past, schools always competed
in the competition division, but
many don’t have the resources, to
participate fully.”

By participating in the bench-
mark division, the University can
“reﬁne our programming and
learn what we can do to enhance
the current system. Benchmark-
ing also will allow us to gain per-
spective on what we, as an organi-
zation, need to do to get better in
regard to our internal processes,”
said Mitchell.

Cooley said he thinks schools
tend to be more successful with
RecycleMania if they -actually
compete within the school itself.

“Only a certain percentage of
students will respond to Earth
protection,” he said. “But a cer-
tain percentage also has a built—in

competitive spirit.”

By framing recycling and con-
servation in those terms, schools
can raise awareness of recycling

on campus, Cooley added.

Pitt student and co—president
of Free the Planet, Jessica Mc-
Nally, said she has “high hopes”
for RecycleMania.

“This year, Facilities ‘Man-

agement actually approached us   y,  ,  _   at 
’  _~ ,_;‘§Are, you words, ’

about signing up for’RecycleMa—
nia, which is incredibly enlighten-
ing. Usually we are the ones beg-
ging the University to adapt more
sustainable practices.”

Facilities Management will
weigh and calculate the total
amounts students recycle, and
Free the Planet will focus on

advertising and promoting the
event, she said.

“Our goal is to let students
know that yes, we do recycle here
at Pitt,” said McNally. ,

Free the Planet and Facilities
Management have worked to-
gether to increase the amount of
easily identiﬁable recycling recep-
tacles. _

sport Weekend alter egos

by Hayley Grgurich
Senior Staﬂ Writer

Dr.‘ Devastation is A not a V li-
censed or accredited medical
doctor, which means he couldn’t
prescribe anything for the pain he
inﬂicted Saturday night. ‘

He doesn’t own a lab coat and
can’t read an X—ray, but he’s been

known todraw blood and issue a

“death certiﬁcate” when the occa-
sion calls for it. t.

. On weekdays, in milder moods,
Dr. Devastaﬁon is known around
the accounting ofﬁce of  Hei-
nz Company as Lou Martin, Certi-
ﬁed Public Accountant. ,

But on the weekends, the doctor

. is in, serving as one of the profes-

sional wrestlers of the Keystone
State \Wrestling Alliance.

After a holiday hiatus, Dr. D
and the rest of the KSWA made
their 2009 debut with ample span-
dex and rage for the New Year’s
Knockout at the Lawrenceville
Moose Lodge. . ‘

Their matches, a staple in the
Pittsburgh wrestling community
since 2000, hearken back to sim-

~ \pl'er times in wrestling when, if a

ﬁghter wanted to look like he was
hitting his opponent with a fold-
ing chair, he actually would.

Shawn “The Enforcer”
Blanchard, another 9-to—5er and
wrestler with the KSWA,‘ said this
is one of his favorite things about
the alliance.

“We’re truer to the sport here,

like it was when they did ‘Studio

WrestHng,”’ said Blanchard, refer-
ring to a popular Pittsburgh—based
TV show in the ’60s and ’70s fea-
turing weekly ﬁghts against area
and national heavyweights.
“That’s what’s different nowa-
days — kids want everything
handed to them. They see those
guys on TV and think they can
do it and don’t realize it’s a lot of
work.” '
. Kids today also want other
things,‘ though. And at Saturday’s
match, they, and. their parents,

_ were anything but shy about sug-

gesting them to the ﬁghters in the
ring. ,
“Tear his beard off!” was one

BAS talks money at event

by Lori Stover
Staﬁ" Writer

Black students used some uncon—
ventional techniques last night to discuss
how to get money and keep it;

A group of about 20 students from
the Black Action Society used fake ﬂu-
orescent—colored money to simulate the
everyday  decisions that a stu-
dent must make Most of the students
discovered that they charge too much

totheircteditcardsandtoooftenﬁiltol

pay more than the minimum balance
Students should pay atleast twice the
minimum balance each month on their
credit cards, said Pitt student Jasmine
Benningg a member of the societyfs

for PNC Bank

The meeting, named after a song
by 50 Cent, “I Get Money,” focused
on why people spend money in certain
‘WY5

‘i‘\s college students I don’t know
about you all, but I spend a lot of mon-
ey And it’s out of hand,” said 
at the meeting

For the simulation, students decided
whether to spend money at a club or
buy a new outﬁt from their favorite store
at The Waterﬁont The students also
spent money on books, rent, groceties
and emetgency situations’

In one soenatio, the students decided

whether to lend $200 to a roommate for

a plane ride home

Mariachi band theme music, to
get back at his adversary, Irishman
“Mike Malachi.”

“Break his leg!” was another
helpful tip, shouted to “Double A”
Anthony Alexander in the penulti-
mate match of the night.

The wrestlers invite and, in
fact, encourage comments from

- armchair fighters. After smashing

“Justin Sane’s” face, black leather
asylum mask and all, into the
ground in the first match of the
night, The Enforcer responded to
hecklers by turning to the crowd,
hands behind his head and tongue
out, with a pelvic thrust.

Duranti daughter: Walking
away will be tough to_ do

Duranti's, page I

A statement from Pitt detailing the terms of
the lease cites an expansion in staff ﬁrom 91 to
133 full-time members as the  force be-
hind the deal. The plan calls for a 10-year deal
 May 1, with an  annual cost of
$492,678. It also calls for a provision for terrni—
nation afterifour years, which would require a
reimbursement of any improvements that the

.IA has made but hasn’t liquidated yet.

While much is to gain from the arrangement,
the -Duranti family, as well as many Oakland
residents, is noticeably somber.  Duranti,
daughter of the restaurants original owners, has
worked in the family business with her seven
siblings for as long as she can remember. »

“It’s  to be tough to justwalk away from

it,” she said “We’Ve all been a part of the busi— _

ness our whole lives.”  to the prominence
the restaurant holds in her life,  mentioned
that she, her brother Frank and her sister Theo-

’ dora worked as many as 90 hours per week.

The restaurant has become a close part of
nearly every Duranti’s life. They have held almost
all family ﬁmctions there. But the Duranti family
bond extends to the Oakland community, which
has embraced the eatery since its inception.

_ “We got anywhere from 300 to 400 phone
calls from people saying that they want to come
ir1 one last time, and that theyfre  to miss
our place,” noted Maria. “We’re still getting
caﬂg, _ .

- Duranti’s deep history extends back to 1959,

when the Stouffefs food chain bought a loca-
tion in Pittsburgh for $1.5 million,  it the
cityfs largest restaurant at the time
RockyandArmemetinGreece'duting
World War II. The government stationed Rocky
there as a colonel in the US. Army, and Anne
served as a translator for the state department.
Thetwo operated out of the Grand Bretagne
Hotel, and their shared love for foodbrought

them  That love also propelled them '

into the restaurant industry, where they cement-‘
ed themselves as a part of Pitisburglfs 
They set up shop in Oakland in 1979, and

many_major events have occurred there since V

then, including a  dinner for john

Heinz, a former US. senator, and a rally for Sec— t

retary of State  Clinton during her?}p1j:'esi-
dential Campaign    V
The restaurant has an enticing atmosphere,

and it’s easy to see why it was home to so many g

prominent meetings and why the family and
community have a difficult time  it.
Duranti’s Restaurant features a unique‘com-
bination of extrgavagance and comfort, with
several massive interconnected seating areas that
could easily seat 100 each. Its deep red carpet
and dim  make for a welcoming and dis-

 atmosphere. One of the decofs most

famous aspects is the bit ofired brick lining the
left wall of the Teak Room, which is an actual
portion of the Duquesne Gardens that hosted

Justin Sane, who hails from the "Pittsburgh Mental Hospital," goes crazy on a poor

opponent on the turnbuckle.
Wrestling, page 5'

a night of good, clean mayhem.
1 Different wrestlers had fan — or heck-
ler — sections full of KS\X/A “Krazies,” as
the regulars are called, in varying levels of
costume.

Most wore jeans and sweatshirts with
Steelers emblems, but the fanatics had ev-

' erything from their own felt and leather face

masks to homemade shirts and face paint.

One group, particularly conspicuous in
their costumes and the fact that they were a
group of 20 or so teenage girls in a Moose
Lodge, came out for Saturday’s ﬁght to sup-
port their high school basketball coach,
“Mr. Puniverse,” _Bob Narr.

D Two of the girls, dressed in costumes
that could only be the aggregate sum of ev-
ery Halloween in their lives, escorted their
coach out to the ring, giggling as he danced
to a hip-hop theme song.

Things weren’t looking good for l\/Ir.
Puniverse early on, but he made a spasmod-

ic comeback late in the match culminating
in multiple crotch stomps to his opponent,
Biker Al, and a ﬁnal insulting mooning with
his valentine’s boxer shorts in the Biker’s
face.

Watching the girls’ team scream and
giggle and little kids ask for autographs
and chant put-downs like “Dairy Queen”
to “The King” Del Douglas, the repetition
by the wrestlers that the KSWA is a family
business made by, and for, the fans is clear.

Every year the alliance hosts a fanfest/
toy drive in December to collect gifts for
abused and neglected children in the Pitts-
burgh area.

KS\X/A members host birthday parties,
make appearances at the homes of sick chil-
dren, ask around when they don’t see a reg-
ular “Krazie” in attendance for a few weeks,
treat one another like family and then, on
ﬁght nights, beat the heck out of that family
to raucous applause.

Obama should end

'Don't Ask,

Congress passed a law in 1993
 the treatment of gay peo-
ple in the U.S.  Commonly
known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,”
the law dictates conditions for dis-
missing gay people from the armed
forces. Because of this law, the mili-
tary has discharged at least 12,000
soldiers over the past 15 years, ac-
cording to the Servicemembers Le-
gal Defense Network Now, Presi-
dent Barack Obarna wants to end
it;

During his campaign, Obarna
stated that he opposed the law.
On Obama’s transition Web site, a
 resident asked spokesman
Robert Gibbs whether the new ad-
ministration planned to change the
law Gibbs responded, “You don’t
hear politicians give a one—word an-
swer much. But: it’s ‘yes.’”

The “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”
law— 10 U.S.C §654 —..states that,
because the military functions as a
separate society from  life
with its own rules and customs,
“the armed forces must maintain
personnel policies that exclude per-
sons whose presence in the armed
forces would create an unaccept-
able risk to the armed forces’ 
standards of morale, good order
and discipline and unit cohesion
that are the essence of military ca-
pability.”

But society has progressed sub-
stantially over the last ZQ years re-
 the acceptance of gays and
lesbians in everyday life. It’s almost
universally acknowledged that ho-
mosexuality isn’t a disruptive force,
except relation to people’s per-
sonal feelings. .

Given the nature of civil rights
progress over the last 100 years, it’s
likely that gay people will continue

to gain rights and privileges that

most people take for granted. It’s

Don't Tell‘

likely that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”
will be struck down, regardless of
moral qualms that some people
have against homosexuality. But
still, is now the right time?

1 It seems like this isn’t the best
time to radically alter the nature of
the military, given that the United
States is  war inilraq and
Afghanistan, not to mention suf-
fering a major recession. The law
does have a point — allowing gay
people in the military could disrupt
troop morale and cohesiveness.

i It’s also likely that the military is
simply set in its ways Path depen-
dency, the idea that past decisions
affect current choices and policy,
is a useful way to look at this ten-
dency. The military simply could be
wary of gays and lesbians because
it always had m the past. While
changing the law could create some
immediate difﬁculty, the increasing

' tolerance of society at large indi-

cates that the problems would pass
over time. '

It’s certainly bold of Obama to
tackle such controversial legislation
so early in his term,'and he deserves
praise for holding true on this carn-
paign promise.

\While this could just be a po-

_litical move to  support from

the LGBT community, it seems as
though _Obarna truly feels interest-
ed in reforming the military, from
ending “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” to
closing the Guantanamo Bay facil-
ity in Cuba.   A t
Overall, the existing law is open-
ly discriminatory and probably
wouldn’t pass if ‘ it were proposed in
Congress today rather than 16 years
ago. Given that the U.S. is progress-

ing toward greater tolerance and ac— '

ceptance, scrapping the law is one
more step forward, and’ doing it
now is better than doing it later.

The Giles Files

Taxes should apply to

by_ Giles“ Howard
Columniat

The public face of organized
religion in this country over the
past few decades has been one of
crass power grabs and political
posturing. Religious institutions

i like the Westboro Baptist Church
have publicly campaigned for or

against specific political can— ’

didates, have vocally opposed
equal rights for gays and have
sought to deny women access to
safe abortions.

Furthermore, they have done
all of this as tax—exempt organi-
zations. The government does
not tax the billions it receives in
donations, and neither does it tax
the land_ its churches, mosques
and synagogues are situated on,

. even as they actively subvert gov-

ernment policies.

It’s time to force religious in-
stitutions to make a choice: con-
tinue to act as political agents
and lose their tax—exempt status
or retreat from political life and
remain tax-exempt organiza-

Some of the most vocal op-

ministers and priests, individuals

churches

I would like nothing more than
to see local churches stripped of
their tax-exempt status for the
role they are playing in local poli-
tics. If it were any other type of
organization, steps would already

have been taken to hold them ac—.

countable for their violation of
the law.
However, this is an issue with

far greater repercussions than

simply the fate of a local ordi-
nance, and for this reason, the
tax—exempt status of religious in-
stitutions must be discussed on a
broader level:

It is important to recognize
that the government exempts
certain organizations and insti-
tutions from taxes because it
believes they have an important,

positive role to play in society.

For this reason, cultural institu-
tions such as museums and li-
braries are exempt from taxes.

But does the existence of
functioning "organized religion
beneﬁt the nation-state?

A museum is tax-exempt be-
cause it teaches people about the
physical world, houses the great
artistic accomplishments of
man and explains to us our his-

tory. Religion distorts the world,
prejudices its adherents against
science and teaches mythology
as literal history.

A library is tax—exempt be-

- cause it makes people more able

citizens by teaching them to think
critically and by exposing them
to the great literature that has
shaped our society. Conversely,
religious institutions have banned
and burned books throughout
human history in an attempt to
suppress critical thought.
Institutions such as museums,

libraries and universities are the-

foundation of republican gov-
ernment. Such places encourage
independent critical thinking and
make for better citizens.

These institutions of culture
and higher learning stand, and

have always stood, in direct op-
position to public religion, which
seeks to create a static society of
dogmatic followers. ' i

. Of course, we must recognize
that public religion has played a
positive role in this country at
certain points in our history. For

"instance, the role played by black

churches in ending segregation
and ﬁnally extending civil rights
to the black ‘community cannot
and should not be ignored in a
discussion about these topics. ‘
However, we must also rec-
ognize that those very black
churches that were instrumental

the 19503 and ’60s are today the
bastions of those who would
deny gays the right to live free of
discrimination and women the
ability to control their bodies. ‘

It is time for this government
to reexamine its relation with the
religious in a way t.hat_will strip
churches, mosques and syna-
gogues of the economic advan-
tages they currently enjoy.

}No longer should we be
forced to bear the economic bur-
den of organized religions that
seek to restrict the liberty of the
individual citizen. Let religious
institutions enjoy -their freedom
of speech, but let them do it at

Big characters are all the rage in
Hollywood this year. From Heath

as ruler-slapping Sister Aloysius
Beauvier, big personalities have

weekend in the Cathedral of

is under the working title “The

“We’re looking for bigactors,

and can really explore exaggerat-
ed movement, voice and charac-
ter,” said Dangerfield Moore, the
director and producer for Worse

said Moore.

The ﬁrst movie by WCTW ro-
tates around the lives of ﬁve jerks
who constantly make fun of one

The main character, an artist

said Moore. .
But it’s not the main character

A new arts and entertainment
incubator for the local community is

‘opernn g in East Liberty with its first

exhibit, “On the Record,” which will
feature works created by artists 
vinyl records I ’ ‘

ArtDimensions Pittsburgh will
provide artists with a space to exhibit
and sell their works as well as provide
them with legal services and practical
knowledge about the business side of
the art world. '

The new organization will feature

V shows like “On the Record” once ev-

ery two months, and these shows will
be open on the weekends In addition,
classes will be offered once a month
and will provide legal services for art-
ists who attend. These services will in-

’ elude anything from help with album

copyrights to business permits, said
ArtDimensions Pittsburgh founder
Daniel Friedson, who is also a profes-
sor at Pitt’s School of Law

Located in a former PNC Bank

is based on a model of renovating ‘

unoccupied buildings near artistic
communities and putting them into

Notorious B.I.G.'s legacy is extended to Hollywood

Inﬂuential rapper brought to silver screen

 

by Justin Jacobs
Ac9’E Editor

As a, tiny, Jewish suburban
white boy growing up in Amish
country Pennsylvania, I always felt
that Notorious B.I.G. spoke. di-
rectly to me.

When he would rap, “It was
all a dream, I used to read Word
Up Magazine,” I would substitute
Newsweek and nod along, occa-
sionally saying aloud, “Bay—beh,
Bay—beh.”

Like a giant father ﬁgure, his
slow, syrupy voice came through
my stereo speakers and told me
to get off my boney ass and make
something of myself. And I took
his advice to heart, quickly rising
to prominence as the premier hip-
hop superstar of my generation,
selling millions of records about
hustling the streets, being kind to
my moms and getting with mad
bitches.

. OK, so that last part isn’t exact-
ly the truth, but Notorious B.I.G.7s
inﬂuence on music, hip-hop fans
and (truthfully) me was undeni-
ably huge —— bigger than the man
himself.

And now, 12 years after he was
tragically gunned down in L.A.,

he’ll be further immortalized in  otoriousﬁ’ mthough, » The movie willprobably  _

ous,” which opens this week. the 7movi_  of Woolard, and boost the already ' 7 '

Biggie isn’t the first famous
music star to have his story told
through ﬁlm, and he certainly
won’t be the last, but his ﬂick is an
interesting case.

First off, his story is certainly
one of the more recent ones to
be committed to the silver screen.
“Ray” followed Ray Charles
through his childhood and young

     

adulthood in the pre-rock ’n’ roll
South. “Walk the Line” saw john-
ny Cash shrouded in black through
the late ’60s, but went no further.
Now there have been semi-
biographical movies portraying
more recent stories — most no-
tably Eminem’s “8 Mile” and 50
Cent’s “Get Rich or Die Trying.”
But here’s the difference as I
see it —- the older-story biopics
work because they portray a world
far removed from where we are
now. . . y
The country music touring cir-
cuit in the 1950s, for example, is
a far cry from that of today. The
newer—story biopics, thus far, have
portrayed artists before they made
it big, similarly portraying views

Sure, probably. Biggie’s story of

rise to fame from a childhood of '

surrounding the man is, while not
as vibrant as Tupac’s, certainly in-

a legend already —- he is —- but
because so many of his surround-

ourselves from the world of Big-

Local artists create awesome

Records, page l0

Friedson explains that ArtDimensions Pitts-
burgh will be a member—driven organization that
depends on the participation of Volunteers, art-

_ ists and law students

This first show is part of its membership
drive A member of ArtDimensions will be able
to exhibit in shows and will also  able to rent
the space, said Friedson, and the first show focus-
ing on member works will take place in May. ,

“Being a member is about displaying your

work, trying to improve "and  to make 8

money,” said friedson. “You can be a perform-
ing artist, Visual artist, writer, rock star — you can
be a poet, and we can plug you into resources”

In addition, members will be entitled to par-
ticipate at monthly meetings and be involved in
the process of bringing art in to exhibit and influ-
encing future exhibits, said Fiiedson. 8

Local vendors, includingjoe "Mamas, are also

providing members with discounts, from free '

dessert to coffee There is an annual member-
ship fee of $50, and this can  paid in monthly

0 installments ‘

Because ArtDimensions Pittsburgh is located
in a former bank, Friedson said it is important
that the first exhibition set a standard for creativ-
ity and  outside the box. He also knew
that the local artistic community would embrace
the Show

‘This community in East Liberty is very
much about real hip hop. They were torn because
they didn’t want to paint on these records. They
wanted to clean and listen to them and scratch
on them. I knew they would appreciate these re-
cords,” he said.

One of the show’s conttibuting artists, Ed-
ward Rawson, often called “D Ravtf’ said that he
has created a lot of work on record sleeves in the

past and that the exhibition is the third of its kind L

in which he has participated. ‘
Rawson, who is Chief  Officer of

- the Martin Luther  Community Mural Proj-

ect as well as a freelance artist, brings his graphic

background to his work for the show

Today’s ditﬁcu|tylevel:Medium art  Vintage  relcofds

‘Tve always been a ﬁgurative painter and
drawer,” said Rawson. “I like to mix it up and give
a feeling of three dimensions, something ren-
dered and realistic, and mix that with ﬂat graphics
and shapes I like to  a push and pull where it’s
flat but so that it feels threedirnensional.” _

Rawson submittedlboth previously and newly
completed  to the show For one of his new
works, Rawson designed a tribal tattoo that, with
a laser cutter and a graphic program that reads
and cuts the design, he used to cut the tattoo into
a record he had spray painted white

The records for the show were donated by

Jerryfs Records in Squirrel Hill Fiiedson says

Filmmakers return
to Pittsburgh roots

One character, named Zoe, plays a dual
role. Not only is she a ﬁgment of Darren’s
imagination, but she is also a real person in
Darren’s life.

In the fantasy, Zoe has an indulgent yet
dynamic personality. 4

“By the end of the ﬁlm she is violent
and insulting,” said Moore. “The actor has
to be very big, but Very realistic too.”

Another character is an artist named
Vince. He is an open-minded, unique, fun-
loving character who makes a ﬁrm point
after giving a speech in the ﬁlm about his
views on the world.

Along with big characters, though,
Moore is also looking for actual artists to
donate their work to the movie to use as
Darren’s art.

Moore is. not only excited to get to meet
big personalities and actors for the ﬁlm,
but he’s also excited to use Pittsburgh once
again as the setting of his ﬁlm.

“I was born and bred in Pittsburgh. I

love it to death,” said Moore. “There’s a"

unique attitude that permeates through
people who live here, and I understand
the mentality of everyone in Pittsburgh.
It shows up in a'lot of my characters on
screen.”.

Moore graduated from the Pitt only last’

semester and is still involved with the de-

- partment of theatre arts.

Now he is looking at graduate schools
and hopes to attend the University of San
Diego and hone his ﬁlmmaking skills.

Auditions for the ﬁlm are Friday from 6
to 11 p.m., Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Auditions take placein 1601 Cathedral
of Learning, and actors are asked to bring
a prepared monologue and also to be ready
to read parts from the new ﬁlm.

WCTW has no money to pay people
right now but promises that you will come

away from the experience with something .

worth much more than dollars and cents.
“Everything is either Volunteers, dona-
tions or out of our own pockets, but we
feed you, you get your name in the credits
and have lots of fun and make plenty of

memories,” said Moore. .

Palko look

Ex-Pitt QB gets another shot in the NFL

by Emily Steiner
' Staﬂ Wrtter

Tyler Palko looks like an-NFL
quarterback. A
Not that he didn’t before, but
his physique has changed over
the past two years since the ex-
Pitt star quarterback graduated,
as have the teams he’s played for
and his health.
_ But come March, Palko is go-

ing to find himself among famil-_
, iar faces.

On the ﬁrst day of March,
Palko will ﬂy to Phoenix to start
training with the Arizona Cardi-
nals —— a team that will make a
appearance in Super Bowl XLIII

. — as a free agent vying for an of-

ﬁcial spot on the roster.

When he gets there, he’ll be
reacquainted with former - Pan-
ther linebacker Gerald Hayes and
reunited with his best friend —

another former Panther —— Larry

Fitzgerald.

“I’m excited to be playing with
Tyler -again,” wrote Fitzgerald in
an e—mail. “It shows that God
rewards people who _continue to
work hard and do things right.

' I’m looking forward to being in

the huddle with him again.”
Palko and Fitzgerald knew

I'm going to go in there and
have a good chance to com-
pete, and that's alliyou can ask
for. The bottom line is you
really have to play.

 

T ler  
alko

each other from football camps
in high school, and both made
the decision to come’ to Pitt to-

gether. They were roommates. for
two years until Fitzgerald entered
the draft after his sophomore
season in 2004 and became the
No. 3-overall pick, landing with
Arizona. V

Since then, Palko, has made
trips to see Fitzgerald in the off-
season to work out and visit as
any other friend would.

But he hopes ‘that next sea-
son, he’ll be throwing Fitzgerald
passes.

“It’ll be good to see himagain

and be back on the team again,” ‘

said Palko. “I’m going to go in
there and have a good chance to
compete, and that’s all you can
ask for. The bottom line is you
really have to play.”

After graduating from Pitt in
2007, Palko signed with the New
Orleans Saints and was a third-
string quarterback for the team, as
well as a member of the practice

So ... guess what?

Weﬂ, my good friend Mark Lucas,

with an answer. A tour guide

‘once told him that the Squirrel

 
   

Hill Tunnels, which opened in

Big East gives more reminders

Plenty of exciting Big East
matchups became history in the

past week. Eight Big East teams-

pack the Top 25 again this week,
with a ninth in West Virginia
looming to jump into the party
as well. ,

Big East basketball is well doc-

I umented as a tough,  brand
‘ of basketball. It is this toughness,
along with many raucous home

court advantages, that often pre-

vail over rankings and numbers.

Many experts ignore the home

court advantage, citing that only a A

few really are troublesome, but in_

that there are no easy nights

the Big East it’s officially a trend
that'home teams have a distinct
advantage against teams of equal
prowess. V
“You’ve just -got to have a tre-
mendous effort every night,” said
Syracuse coach  Boeheirn.
“And when you go on the road,
you’ve got to have a tremendous

effort, you’ve got to stay out of, M

foul trouble, you’ve got to make
your free throws and then you’re
just going to be in the game. And
when you don’t, you’re not going
to be in the game late.” _

In the,.past week, not includ-,‘.,
ing yesterday or today, there were
16 Big East games.

Of those 16, the home team

Since the season opened last month, the
Pitt men’s and women’s track teams have
competed at the Golden Flash Gala, the
Akron Quad and the Penn State Open.

And after. watching his team’s recent
performances, Pitt coach Alonzo Webb is
happy with what he’s seen.

“We have quite a few athletes that are
outstanding,” said Webb.‘ “We should have
good seasons on both sides.”

For -the women, senior Janessa Murphy
led the jumpers at the Penn State Open, ﬁn-
ishing second in the long jump and eighth
in the triple jump.

The three—time Big East champion has
several goals for her ﬁnal season as a Pan-
ther, including reaching nationals in the
long jump for both indoor and outdoor.

f‘I’d also like to reclaim my outdoor Big
East title and repeat my indoor Big East
title in the long jump,” said Murphy.

Along with Murphy, team captain My-
caiah Clemons leads the Panthers. Clem-
ons, who is sixth in the 60—meter hurdles
nationally, has captured two ﬁrst place ﬁn-
ishes in the event this season.

The 400-meter relay team of Katelyn
Brown, Anita James, Patricia Anyanwu and
Kari Hedderick ﬁnished ﬁrst at the Golden
Flash Gala and fourth at the Penn State
Open.

On the men’s side, .a set of freshman

"twins, Jermaine and Jerome Lowery, lead

the way.
At the Penn State Open, Jermaine Low-

Jerome Lowery was a member of the 400-

meter relay team that placed fourth and

also ﬁnished 11th inthe 400-meter dash.
‘There is a great spirit of camaraderie

with both female and male athletes,” said‘

Jermaine Lowery. “We have so much fun as
a team on and off the track.” J

He added that he has really enjoyed shar-
ing his experience at Pitt with his brother,
especially because he always has someone
by his side and someone to cheer him on.

“My mother and father always told us
that mybrother and I have a push—pull rela-
tionship,” he said. “Jerome pushes me and
I pull him.” -

He said he hopes to place in the Big
East Indoor Championships in the 400-
_meter dash and the 60 high hurdles and
also to win a Big East Outdoor title for the
400-meter hurdles. J

“My all—time goal is to help the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh men’s track and ﬁeld
team ‘win many Big East championship
titles while I’m here,” he said. _

Junior Eric Jones, the reigning Big East

champion in the triple jump, is currently '

third in the event. The 4x400 relay team
composed of Jerome Lowery, Brione Reid-
Carthan, Dontave Cowsette and Anthony
Hobwana ﬁnished ﬁrst at the Akron Quad
and fourth at the Penn State Open. '

“The men had a little bit of a down year
last year, but there is more depth on the
men’s side this year,” said Webb.

The Panthers continue their season on
Jan. 24 when they compete in the George
Mason Patriot Games in Fairfax, _Va.

squad during the 2007-08 season. Though
he didn’t see much playing time during the
regular season, Palko got to play with who
he now believes is the best quarterback in
the NFL: Drew Brees. L

“I wasn’t a ﬁrst-round draft pick, so I
had to ﬁght, scrap and claw my way to try

to get where you want to go,” said Palko. I

“I owe a lot of my progress as far as how
I’ve progressed in my ﬁrst year to [Brees].
He’s really helped me out a ton, he’s a great

guy!)
In his ﬁrst preseason with the Saints,

Fitzgerald on the field again

of 271 yards and one touchdown in three
games. ,

But in the ﬁnal preseason game of the
2008-09 season, Palko tore the ligaments in
his thumb that make it-opposable and was
waived from the Saints on Aug. 30. _

The injury to his right thumb cost him
his chances with New Orleans, but it did
lead him back home to Pittsburgh.

“It was kind of a freak injury,” said
Palko. “I didn’t feel it. I" just remember
looking down at my thumb, and it was
turned upside down and backwar .”

“I’m stubborn when it comes
to following protocol because I
want to make sure I get out ahead
of schedule,” said Palko. “I did
everything they told me to do, I
just pushed the envelope a little
bit and ﬁnished way ahead of
schedule.”

Pitt A offensive coordinator
Matt Cavanaugh said that dedica-
tion was one of the things that
makes Palko who he is.

“Without a doubt, Tyler is one
of the most dedicated players I
have ever been around,” said Ca-
vanaugh, who spent some time
with Palko during his rehabilita-
tion this season. ‘

Along the way, Palko got a
chance to follow Cavanaugh and

_ his old team.
And although Pitt’s most re-

fans might have wished, Palko
said it was just a low point on an

The NFL is a bottom line

business, it's based on good
performance, and that's why
I love it. VVhen you look back

on it, you really can't blame

anybody but yourself.

“I think they’ve shown signs
of _ improvement, especially on
the defensive part,” said Palko.
“Offensively they were hot and
cold sometimes, but that’s just
some inexperience at quarterback
with Billy [Stull]. All in all, they
got nine wins, that’s the bottom

ﬁne. . .
“Anytime you play quarter-
back, especially in this town, if
you have a bad season or a bad

game, you’re going to get criti_-I

cized. In Pittsburgh, you want to
win, but they don’t _want to win
today, they want to win yesterday.
All you can do is ﬁnd out how to
fix the problems, work at it, and
next time you get a chance to per-
form, perform better.” A

It’s similar to the situation
Palko is in himself. He hasn’t
stopped working. He’s pushed
his athleticism and hopes to see

some results in Arizona, where,

I . he will be vying for either Matt

Leinart or Brian St. Pierre’s jobs
behind starting quarterback Kurt
Warner.

_“The NFL is a bottom line
business, it’s based on good per—,
formance, and that’s why I love
it,” said Palko. “When you look
back on it, you really can’t blame
anybody but yourself.”

get back into the news by endorsing the
story of his friend, Brian McNamee, over
that of embattled pitcher Roger Clemens,
if you remember that whole saga. “I believe
my friend,” Radomski told ESPN earlier
this week, which reminds me of the Great
Bus-Stop Tripping Incident of 1996 

— It was late fall, and young tempers
ﬂared over the deﬁnition of “regurgitat-
ed.” Those who didn’t know wanted to and
those who knew wouldn’t tell. Amid the
confusion, young Jimmy Srr1ith* tripped
and nearly broke his glasses. A tribunal was
held to ﬁnd out if foul play was involved
amid accusations from the victim. But the
fourth graders at the stop wouldn’t give up

one of their own. The jury was hung and

the case was dropped. The deﬁnition of

regurgitated wasn’t discovered until years"

later. The perpetrator was never found.

the touch]

— Words that sound cool but that mean
bad things: racketeering. That’s really the
only word I had in mind: racketeering.
\Wouldn’t it sound cool and adventurous to
be a racketeer if it meant something other
than a person who commits crimes such
as extortion, loansharking, bribery and ob-
struction of justice in furtherance of illegal
business activities? Yeah it would. Rack-
eteers  away!  To prison.

- A roommate discussion: Do you
think Matt Hasselbeck was the ﬁrst choice
for EAS to lead its new commercial? I’m
betting that they hadn’t originally intended
for Brady Quinn’s meathead, “Now I’m
done,” to sound like Phil Mickelson after
his fourth plate at the breakfast buffet. _

THINKING or QUITTING SMOKING?!

UPMC seeks smokers ages 18»-65 who are

planning to quit smoking soon.

UPMC seeks smokers for research on the short-
term effects of a Food and Drug Administration-
approved oral medication, Chantix (varenicline),

on smoking behavior, craving, and mood. This is

not a treatment study.

You will first have a brief physical exam. The study
has two phases, each three weeks tong. Each phase
involves a brief practice quit attempt over 5 days.

You will visit the labtor 10-15 minutes on three

to five days each week. Visits will be scheduled
between the hours of 11 am. and 6 pm. You will
be asked to take study medication that may or

may notcontain Chantix. Participants who complete
the entire study will receive $595.

Ali participarzts wilt be given free written materials
on quitting smoking at the end of the last session.
Optional treatment involving brief counseling and
Chantix will also be offered without charge.

For more information, call 412-246-5306.

Tough crowds on the road

just one reason for losses

Dianna Connor / Senior Staff Photographer

Student sections like Pitt's Oakland Zoo have created problems for opposing players

and coaches all season long.
Big East, page 15

won all but three of those matchups. St.
Johns fell to a superior No. 3 Connecti-
cut squad 67—’55, DePaul lost to Cincinnati
59-55, and Providence lost to No. 14 Mar-
quette 91-82.

This means that teams such as'Pitt, Syr-
acuse (twice) and Notre Dame have already
lost on the road to Big East opponents this
year. Pitt fell to Louisville, Syracuse lost at
Georgetown and Pitt, and Notre Dame
lost at Syracuse.

All of these games were nationally tele-

vised, getting already traditionally tough
crowds into a frenzy. '

It’s pretty much a lock that none of
these teams, or anybody else in the con-
ference for that matter, expects to end the
season with an undefeated in—conference
record. At least according to Pitt center
Dejuan Blair.

“Sometimes you’re just going to come
up short,” said Blair. “That’s what you’ve
got to understand. If you play your hearts
out and you come up short, you shouldn’t

ll be that mad about the loss. A lot of teams J

take the game that they lost to the next
game, and that’s how they lose.”
But that conference toughness means

good things for the teams that do steal

-7 wins on the road — like Pitt did against

Georgetown or Connecticut did against
West Virginia. At this point, those two
teams —— which match up on Feb. 16 -
have an edge in the league.

 

 

While the Big East is really starting to
beat itself up, Marquette is getting a chance
to move into the spotlight.

Marquette boasts one of the most ex-
perienced and dynamic backcourts in the

country with the three—headed monster of —

Dominic James, Jerel McNeal and Wesley
Matthews. James, the point guard, leads the
team with 5.2 assists per game, while Mat-
thews and McNeal average 19.1 and 18.8

points per game, respectively.

A team like Marquette, which can score
a ton of ways, has the toughness to go on
the road and win and has one of the bet-
ter home court advantages, is dangerous
down the stretch.

The Golden Eagles went on a tear to
finish off Providence on the road last game
and now face a deﬁning stretch in their
season. First up is a home game against

Where you belong.

DePaul with a game at Notre Dame and
home against Georgetown to follow.

Also keep in mind Marquette’s stretch,
which begins Feb. 21: at Georgetown,
home against Connecticut, at Louisville, at
Pitt and then home against Syracuse. Good
luck with that one, Marquette.

On to the awards:

Big East Hammer on the Hard-
wood: _

Georgetown forward DaJuan Summers
is quietly becoming one of the conference’s
best scorers on the front line. He now has
two straight games of 21 points —'-— one
in an 88-74 win over Syracuse and another
in a 76-67 loss at Duke. Summers also had
ﬁve steals and three blocks in those games.
The junior’s scoring output is taking the
scoring pressure off of freshman Greg
Monroe, helping him adjust to Big East
play by focusing more on defense.

Big East Cupcake:

Providence held a’ five—point lead at
the half over Marquette and stretched the
lead to 13 at one point in the second half.
But after an interesting moment in which
Jonathan Xavier —- the brother of Provi-
dence player Jeff Xavier — walked onto
the court.to argue with a referee, the Friars
folded down the stretch. Marquette forced
the game into a transition track—meet game,
and the Friars fell 91-82.

Big East Matchups to Watch:

Two big matchups load the week ahead
for the Big East. Starting on Saturday,
Connecticut needs to turn around from
last night’s bout with Villanova and travel
to No. 19 Notre Dame in what should be
a measuring stick for two preseason Big
East Player of the Year candidates in the
Irish’s Luke Harangody and Connecticut’s
Hasheem Thabeet. Then on Sunday, a
huge matchup pits No. 8 Syracuse against
No. 12 Louisville. Don’t forget Monday
either, when No. 10 Marquette travels to
Notre Dame.

Upset Alert of the Week:

South Florida is a sneaky—tough place to
play. It’s not as loud as some home arenas in
the Big East, but the combination of long

travel and a high school basketball game- .
like atmosphere helps the Bulls play solid

on their home court. Watch, out Villanova
— noon gameon Saturday is against these
Bulls. With the Wildcats coming off a big
game against Connecticut and looking
ahead to their tilt against Pitt, this could be
their trap game.
