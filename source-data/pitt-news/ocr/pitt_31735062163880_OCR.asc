Ambassador Galbraith
To Lecture at Midday

Former U.S. Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Gal-
braith, will speak on “The Politics of Privation” at Midday
Series on April 1 in SU Ballroom.

Galbraith is Warburg Professor of Economics at Harvard
University. He has also held teaching positions at the Uni-
versity of California, Princeton and Cambridge University
in England.

At Harvard, Galbraith initiated a seminar on economic develop-
ment which since has been added
to the curricula of other academic
institutions.

Responsible for Ceasefire

He is credited for the. quick
American and British reactions to
the Chinese invasion of India and
thus, in the eyes of Indians, as
largely responsible for the cease-
ﬁre. He also played a central role
in American policy and assistance
as it related to Indian Economic
development. _ _

On his departure, Prime

Minister Jawaharlal Nehru

took the unusual step of pub-

licly thanking Ambassador

Galbraith for his help, advice

and labors on behalf of peace

and development in the area.

A prominent economist, Gal-
braith served as Deputy) Admin-
istrator of the Olﬁce of Peace Ad-
ministration in charge of price control and later was a director of the
United States Strategic Bombing Survey during World War II. He
was awarded the Medal of Freedom and the President's Certiﬁcate
of Merit for his war time services.

Editor and Author
After the war, he served as the head of the Office of Economic
Security Policy in the Department of State. He was an editor of
Fortune for several years.
Galbraith is the author of American Capitalism, The Great

Crash: 1929; The Aﬂfluent Society and The. Liberal Hour.

In 1952 and 1956 Galbraith served on the campaign staff of Adlai
Stevenson. He was Chairman of the Economic Advisory Committee
of the Democratic Advisory Council from 1956 to 1960. He was an
early supporter of late President Kennedy during 1960 elections.

Bolstered  

University Puts Finger
On Plan’s Phase Two

By PAT POLLINO

The second phase of the University’s plan to bolster
spring term enrollment —— student activities — has been shift-
ed into high gear as the present term draws to a close. Em-
phasis has been placed on the number of activities, the avail-
ability of them to students and an increase in allocations
provided for their existence. Coupled with the expanded cur-
riculum phase of the spring term plan, the two phases have
already triggered positive indication of an enrollment boost
over past spring sessions.

“There was a considerable pickup noted in spring regis-

tration the past week,” said Bernard S. Adams, special assist-
ant to the Chancellor. ,

Adams’ remark may appear a little premature when com-
paring this year’s ﬁgures, as of March 20, with those recorded
by Student Records at the same time last year. There were
3102 registered in 1963 as comparedto 2998 this spring. How-
ever, a bulk of the present registration ﬁgure has been real-
ized within the past week and has brought about an extended
registration period.

The University is extending the registration period

for the spring term until April 8. Deans have been
authorized" to waive the nor-
mal late registration fee for

‘Political Science Professor
Attacks Academic Stagnation

By NANCY LYNN DELANEY
The man who claimed he had “nothing profound to say,” Dr.
Richard Cottam, upbraided the academic community, which is re-
puted to be profound, for having nothing at all to say about problems

really profound.

At Monday’s “Last Lecture," Dr. Cottam, associate professor of
political science and research associate in administrative science,
pointed out a growth in stagnation and mediocrity, a falling off of

values, and a lack of direction in
Western society. He attacked non-
involved intellectuals for lack of
concern with politics, particularly
foreign affairs, and termed their
attitude “escapism.”

Noting that the public, which
has been over-idealized in the
past, must be accepted as ig-
norant, dull, unimaginative, and
hard to move, he indicated that
the intellectuals must serve as in-
novators. There is still a great
deal of room for individual inﬂu-
ence. Yet many of today’s intel-
lectuals are preoccupied with
forms and structure, rather than
ideals and objectives.

No Reference Made to Values

No reference is made to val-
ues in foreign policy among in-
tellectuals, Dr. Cottam lamented.
This results in an abdication to

tration process prior to this
date. Students may also reg-
ister during the one-day late
registmtion period April 15,
but in such cases the late reg-
istration fee will be charged.
“Some students are just now be-
ginning to take into account the
scope and diversity of the spring
term program,” said Adams.

A major facet oi spring activi-
ties falls under the co-ordination
of Student Union Board. Larry
Heller, director of Board activi-
ties, pointed out that the Midday.
Series committee has received
one speaker confirmation thus
far and has extended invitations
to several other personalities.
He said Dr. Lionel C. Knights
will appear June 17, and invita-
tions have been sent to Gov-
ernor Scranton, Walter Reuther,

the bureaucracies, which tend to run things for the sake of bureauc-
racies. Those who are concerned with values seem to be restricted
to the Goldwater group or the small activist groups for peace, neither
of which Warrant Cottam’s respect.

Several solution attempts that Dr. Cottam considered futile
included picking out “Big Devils” on which to blame everything;
offering" oversimpliﬁed answers; searching for a “magic key” —
a mathematical formula to avoid the real issues; and invading
Washington with specialists. who often bring in merely a “high
level of mediocrity.”

Dr. Cottam himself offered three suggestions: ﬁrst, Intellectuals
should discard the idea that they can, or should, do value-free work.
Secondly, the real problems deserve the attention of people other
than journalists, which they are not getting. Thirdly, intellectuals
should become directly involved in politics and should make their
views known. '

 

applications are still available for
committee chairmanship and
membership in all five of these

The committees include Fresh-

plications for the upperclass coun-
selors posts, according to
Schwartz.

E. E. [Wen Capture Engineers’ Wee

By NANCY FUCHS

The EJ.ectrical Engineers placed in seven out of ten Engineering
Week events to win the Shamrock Award by a slim margin of
eleven points. ,.

The Civil Engineers placed first in four events, but the con-
sistent second and third place winnings of the E.E.’s was just enough
to edge out the Civils. The final tally read: E.E.’s 1447.048 points;
Civils, 1436.534 points; and Mechanical Engineers (including aero-
nautical), 1440.808 points.

The events of the Week, termed “probably the best planned and
carried out Engineers’ Week we’ve ever had” by an aeronautical
engineer, began with -St. Patrick’s arrival in a parade last Monday.
The Irishman arrived on a horse draped in green. The first place
award for “uniqueness and participation” went to the Chemical
Engineers and the Civils. ,

The displays set up by each department Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday, attracted some 600 high school students, ac-
cording to E.E., Jay Furick. The Civil Engineering‘project,
tackling the problems of constructing a lunar base, won ﬁrst
prize.

The alumni dinner in -the University Club, well—attended by

alumni and seniors, was “the usual success” in the words‘ of Chem.
15., Bill Few. Thursday’s College Bowl, an innovation replacing the
usual debate, stressed non-technical, general inl’ormation—type ques-
-tions. The Civils again emerged victorious.
_ The “gimmick,” prdved to be a tug of war, between groups
wearing costumes to represent their department. The Civils received
‘first prize based on 60 per cent for costumes and 40 per cent for
‘winning the tug. Some of the, more ingenous outﬁts included the
Chem. E.’s Flintstones and the E. E.’s electric circuit, with four men
dressed as a battery, resistor, conductor, and capacitor.

The climax of’ the week, the Shamrock Ball, held at the
Penn-Sheraton Hotel, was a gala affair. Baron Elliott’s orches-
tra provided dance music ranging from the conventional fox-trot

 Kingston Trio Explains Success Story

Sold Out at Syria Mosque

By IVIARVIN ZELKOVVITZ

Unlike other singing groups that enjoy
a year or two of popularity, then fade, the
Kingston Trio has been a leading folk
singing group for eight years. Their in-
formal style and their song selections have
been the primary reasons for their success,
according to Trio member, Nick Reynolds.

Because of the Trio’s informality on

stage, the audience can never be sure of
what they are going to do next. “We

always keep the audience guessing,” Reyn-

olds explained. “If we didthe same songs-

_in the same style all the time, no one
would come back -to see us.”

The Trio has been successful in keeping

wall, Reynolds confessed, “Well, it gets a
lit.tle rough.”

V Antics

The Trio goes -through many antics on
stage, most of them unrehearsed,‘ according
to Bob Shane. “They just happen,” he said.

“That’s right,” “Reynolds agreed. “Take
tonight. “That ‘Hi, Mom!’ that Bob yelled
out near the beginning of the show was

- unexpected.”

“Well, my Mother was out there,”

Shane explained, “what else could I do?”
But the Trio hasn't always been this
carefree. There was a time, four years

ago, before John Stewart replaced Dave
Guard, that the Trio encountered what
Shane termed “a very distressing situa-
tion.”

‘Wed-nesda.y,_lVIarch' 25, 1964 —i    lI’age3 _;

the rest of the group became so tense that
Guard left. John Stewart replaced him.
The Trio wasn’t sure,~ however, that it
could maintain its popularity. “There were
some anxious moments,” Reynolds said.
“The ﬁrst few weeks after we cut our ﬁrst
albumuwith John, we didn’t know if we
were going to be_a hit or a bust. As it
turned out, we were successful.”

Still Great

The Trio was, and still is, a smash.
Shane and Reynolds attribute a lot of
their current success to Stewart. “John’s
been just great,” Reynolds siad. “He gave
us new blood, and kept us going. He’s
written songs for us, and does most of our
arranging. We have much more original

More than Variety

‘ The Trio doesn’t attribute its eight years‘

of success to variety alone. “I guess we're

S a little lucky,” Reynolds explained. But

there is more to the Trio’s success than
that. - A ‘

“We put a lot of work into our show,"
Reynoldssaid. “But we have fun doing
it. We're doing what we want to do, and
we like it.” ‘

\
One reason members of the Trio enjoy

their work so much, according to Reynolds,
is because their product is their own. “We

' . do our ‘own song arranging, and alot of

our song writing,” Reynolds said. “If we

' didn’t enjoy what we are doing, we’d all

be nuts by now.”

Then, as Bob Shane started to climb a

.do

Reynolds explained. “We didn’t want to
contrived arrangements, and Dave‘
Guard did. He wanted to do more spiri-
tual, shouting-type Negro songs. If you’ve
heard his album (Whiskey Hill Singers),
you know what I mean.

“We can’t do that kind of song too much.

We’re grown, white, American men, and
we can’t successfully emulate the songs of
another race, or ethnic group. We don’t
have the voices for it. We_ have to do our
songs in our own style.”

Songs like “O Ken Karanga,” and
“Awheemowell” are African songs, but

‘ the Trio has adapted them to ﬁt their

voices.

The situation between Dave Guard and

roll singer, has enjoyed being with
Shane and» Reynolds as much as they
have enjoyed him. “It’s wonderful,”
Stewart admits. “It's not like being a
rock and roller. When yoll’re a rock and
roller, your audience doesn’t respect you.
Now, when we go on stage, we're Ire-
spected. It’s a good feeling.”

How much longer will the Trio last?
“Someone also asked us that same question
eight years ago,” Reynolds ‘said. “It’s
hard to tell how long we’ll last. We ‘could
go under tomorrow, or we could last an-
other twenty years.” Judging from the
audience’s reaction to the Trio at the
Mosque, Bob Shane, Nick Reynolds,’ and
John Stewart will be strumming guitars
for a long time.

      Editorials: Summertime 5tI'pemIs

‘As the winter trimester slowly begins turning over on its back in its
ﬁnal agony’ and rigor-mortis creeps into its system, the University is

' busily preparing itself for the spring term. This is a term with unique
'problems and with uniqueladvantages. The biggest problem is that

- would rather while or work away the long vacation, and the biggest"

students have little desire to attend classes during the summer and

‘ advantage is that the University wants“ students to come to school
.' and is out to make it as comfortable as possible for those who do attend.

We have already mentioned in previous editorials the various aca-
demic reforms which the University has instituted for the term"coming

4. up, and Bernie Adams, special assistant to the Chancellor, believes that

the “considerable pickup noted in spring registration in the past week”
is an indication of the growing student awareness of the University’s in-
tention to make the summer worthwhile.

If this is so, and there is no reason to suspect that it is not, then
the recent announcement by the University of its intention to bolster the

‘student activity schedule as well as the academic program should also

 

bring in a rush of students to register. _ '
The reason for this is more indirect than anything else, yet it

 

should still work. One of the worst aspects of living on campus has been
the relative dearth of “summer” activities. There were always a few
programs of the same type which are held during the fall and winter
terms but these were neither well-attended nor usually even well-re-
ceived by the students. I

They were simply not planned around the weather, a factor which
must be considered in any program held during the warm summer months.
It is pure misery to sit through a lecture even on sex when the temper-
ature is 110 degrees in the shade. This year, however, there are plans for
informal outdoor evening programs, andthere is talk of holding the film
series out on the Cathedral lawn. While not designed in themselves to
attract students, they will indirectly do so because they will make the
summer. just a little less tedious and possibly convince many students

that it might just be worth giving the term a try.

If nothing else the willingness of the University to invest more
money in student activities may be an incentive for the organizations re-
ceiving the stipends to produce more and better activities and thus beneﬁt
themselves as well-as the students they serve.

. Debating Union.

Th-is is the first part of a special
article on the community college move-
ment submitted by Jim Joseph, senior in
speech and president of the William Pitt

Dr. Edward Eddy, the crusading Presi-
dent of Chatham College, in a special re-
port to The Pittsburgh Press, took aim on
the community college movement and

I - loosed a salvo in an address to the Amer-

ican Alumni Council that soundly rapped
the knuckles of educators advocating in-
creased state and federal support for fur-
ther expansion of community colleges.

Dr. Eddy places-a high value on the
stimulating experiences offered by the en-
vironment associated with residential in-
stitutions. He argues that students must
break their ties with the high school gang
and the “old home town” and replace them
by identification with the academic com-
munity comprising the residential institu-
tion. More simply stated, Eddy, ‘submits
that the only meaningful educational ex-
perience is to be found at four-year resi-

dential institutions- A government pro-

gram designed to further support the
community colleges would cheat the stu-
dent out of a genuine college education.
But Dr. Eddy has unfairly criticized
the community college. Ignoring the

philosophical base of higher education V

A and its associated value system, he de- -
‘rnands that the community college be
damned because it doesn’t fulﬁll a value
it was never designed to fulﬁll. The
Chatham President. has extracted one
ideal from a spectrum of ideals compris-
ing, the American system of higher edu-
cation and transposed it to an institu-
tional arrangement that is designed to
fulﬁll other ideals. This is akin to urging ‘
abolition of the judicial branch of the
Federal government on the grounds that

' it doesn’t provide for geographical repre-

sentation and has no ‘place in the Amer-
ican democracy.

The obvious error in this line of reason-
ing, as well as Dr. Eddy’s, is that the legis-
lative and judicial branches of the gov-
ernment are intentionally designed to em-
bodyl separate yet compatible values or
ideals, both of which are part of a consis-
tent philosophical underpinning.

To understand the spectacular growth
of community colleges, one is obliged to
‘understand that philosophical fabric of
which it is a part. The community college
is founded on the basic ideal of the Ameri-
can system of education: equality of op-
portunity. All too often, equality of op-
portunity is interpreted to mean equal ex-
posure to the same kind of education. This

-— interpretation of educational experience is

equal.” But men are equal only before the
law. Men are, in fact, created diﬁerent.
They are radically unequal in their abili-
ties, motivations, and interests. In light of
these myriad levels of ability, motivation,
and interests that represent our society,
the educational system must provide di-
verse opportunities that correspond to the
diversity of the clientele.

This view of educational opportunity
is the same- as that embodied by the
Rockefeller Panel Reports and John W.
Gardner, President ofthe Carnegie" Cor-
poration of New York. Equality of op-
portunity must be interpreted to mean
equality of diverse opportunity.

Dr. Eddy makes a second un-
warranted assumption in his indictment
of community ' colleges. Not only does
he mistakenly claim that the only mean-
ingful educational experience can come
from aresidential college, but also pre-
sumes that the only meaningful educa-
tional experience is to be found at four-
year institutions, a la Pitt, Chatham, and -
Carnegie Tech. ' ‘

This assumption is open to the same
criticism that was leveled at the ﬁrst as-
sumption. Obviously, four—year college op-
portunity is different than two-year col-
lege opportunity; the focus is different.
There may be some degree of overlap in
curriculum offering, but the‘ similarities

The logical question at this point seems
to be: What is the unique nature of _the
community college and what ideal or value
does it embody? To understand the answer
to this question, one must accept the fact
that there are various kinds of community
colleges. In the broadest sense, commun-

ity colleges include public tuition-free

community colleges, public and private
junior colleges, and two-year extension
colleges. All of these institutional ar-
rangements exist on a. spectrum, but this
spectrum is not the same type as the spect-
rum of diverse opportunities presented
earlier. , -

_ Rather, the spectrum is more a con-
tinuim that measures various degrees of
the achievement if ideal equality of op-
portunity. This ideal opportunity is mea-
sured by the degree of efficiency which
the institution achieves in attracting all
students who can proﬁt from education
beyond the high school.

Dr. Eddy passed judgment on this ideal
also by casting it off as a “pleasant dream.”
But close scrutiny of two-year institutions
shows that (1) the ideal is not “pleasant
dream” and can be approximated almost
exactly, and (2) certain two-year institu-

‘,E‘1_:ions are more capable of ach_iev'ng that '

Senior Loves Lovers

Editor, The Pitt News:

Several times during the past
few years you have printed let-
ters from various segments of the
University community, all of
which could be simply expressed
as: I saw somebody necking and/
or kissing etc.,i naughty, naughty
on them and why doesn’t some-
body arrest them or connect each
of them to the ends of a 20-foot
pole with one-foot chains to keep
them apart?

Just what kind of a person
writes that sort of crank letters.
I’m not sure, but I would like
to venture a guess. They might
come from old-maid secretaries,
conﬁrmed bachelors, a nd those
pseudo-sophisticate students who
consider" their great minds to be’
quite above mere emotion.

How I feel toward the one I
love, and" how we express that
feeling is our business alone, and

The

I resent very much some neb-
nose making it his business. Love,
being the V most important part
of a person’s total education,

should not be “outlawed” by this

institution or any other. The co-
lossal futility of attempting to
stem the flow of human emotion
renders such crank letters totally
insigniﬁcent to my point of view.
And, I might add, the persons
who write such letters, as well
as those who stroll‘ around aim-
lessly with their hand in their
hip pockets looking for someone
to scold, rate the same contempt
and disgust. ‘ .
And I’d..be willing to bet that
90 per cent of the student body
agrees 'with ‘me, even though
many‘ of them would never. say

V so to‘ another, for -fear of being
chained to one end of that .20-

foot pole.

Spring Student Activities Designed

To Promote Increased Attendance

“We are also considering the
possibility of developing activities
cooperation with Women’s
Housing Board and Men’s Dorm
Council for the quadrangle area,”
said Heller.

The Board’s PM Series commit-
tee is currently negotiating with
the Berea College dance group
and, "according to Heller, is de-
veloping ideas for informal out-
door evening programs. He added
that the film series also will con-
tinue.

Two lecture series slated for
the spring are the Andrew Mel-
lon Professor and School of
Education programs.

Prof. Leonard Roth, mathe-
matics, and Prof. George P. Mur-

dock, anthropology, will deliver

18, respectively. .

The School of Education agenda

Metropolitan Opera Studio is
producing Don Pasquale May 4
in Stephen Foster Memorial. The
annual summer reception, week-
ly SU patio dances and Gate-
way Clipper rides and pool parties
will headline the social events.

In order to help ﬁnance addi-
tional spring term activity, the
University has provided’ for funds
to meet requests in the area of
student affairs. According to Rich-
ard Woodruff, director of the
budget, funds went to Student
Union Board, The Pitt News,
WPGH and the Dean of Students.

“These funds were designated
primarily for purposes of pro-
motion of spring term atten-
dance,” said Woodruff.- “Con-
sequently, the allocation of
funds was made in terms of ef-
fects and beneﬁts to the general

student body, rather than on any
one speciﬁc group or groups.”

Student Union Board received
$2,000 in additional funds to be
used for an increase in Midday,
PM, student film, and social activi-
ties for the general student body.
Also $250 has been set aside for a
major social event sponsored by

Student Government.

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis enters the 1964
baseball season with a completely different out-

— look than he had last year. Last season Lewis

was more conﬁdent than Cassius Clay. This
year, with the material
less prosperous, Lewis
describes himself as _“ex-
pectant.”

“I.’m looking forward
to this season much more
than last year,” Lewis

"said. That’s like Casey
Stengel enjoying the
Mets after managing the

iﬁes his statement. “Last
year I knew What we
had. This ear ‘ust about
BOB SMIZIK everyone y is lquestion-
able. I really want to see how things work out.”

A How things work out this season remains to
be seen. Lewis has lost ju_st about all of the top
ball players from last year’s team which was
19-3. He lost his entire starting inﬁeld, one out-
ﬁelder and his two top pitchers. Three of those
players have signed contracts with major league
teams.

Yankees. But Lewis clar- '

It’s obvious that Lewis had good cause for
his optimism last season. With that kind of
team Lewis had a right to sound ‘off about what
kind of season he expected.‘ '

This year he’s not saying as much. “I’m al-
ways.conﬁdent” he said, but he didn’t follow
this upvwith the usual optimistic preaching that
has denoted his pre-season talk overthe past
two campaigns. p’

Lewis admits that his big problem is hitting.
Centerﬁelder Fred Mazurek is the only plus
.300 hitter he has returned from last season
and Lewis says that, “the best hitter is the guy
that’s going to get the starting assignment in
most positions.” _ . ‘

‘Aside from Mazurek the only regular Lewis
has returning from last season is Brian Fisher.

Fisher played left ﬁeld last year, but will move _

into his regular position, ﬁrst base, this year.
Fisher hit .270 last year and Lewis expects him
to do much better this season.

But it will take more than hitting by Ma-
zurek and Fisher to carry the team. Lewis is
counting on. two lettermen -- both with bad
knees — to pick up the hitting load. Inﬁelder

Jim Yedlicka had knee trouble which kept him
from playing regularly last year, but he proved
he can swing a big bat. Barry Wetzel missed all
of last season with a bad" knee, b_ut'Lewis is
also counting on him to provide some hitting.

' Wetzel can play just about anywhere and Lewis

will probably ﬁnd him a handy man to hav
around. -

The rest of the team, except for the pitching
and catching, hinges on a bunch of freshmen
and sophomores. Lewis is hoping that’ he’ll get
some hitting from Steve Eiseman,,George Prus-
sin, Larry Szykowny, Bernie-Stein, Chris Kat-
sofanas, Bill Sivitz,’ Nick Tarlotta and Dave
Reichenbach. Those are just a few of the new
names -that Lewis is counting on to make his
starting team. -' ‘

Lewis has a tough managing job in front
of him. The team looks like it has potential to
develop. Butit is a young team and it may not
reach its maturity this season. The big question
is can the team hit. This was the problem at the
start of last season and the team solved it as
some astronomical batting averages showed.
Only time and. a lot of batting practice will
show whether Lewis has another winner.

Grady Sends
Three Men To
NCAA Meet

Coach Ben 'Grady will
enter three Panther swim-
mers in the NCAA swim-
ming championships this
weekend at Yale. Grady will
enter Ron and Rob Levine and
diver Don Hahnfeldt.

Ron Levine will swim in the

200-yard butterﬂy, and Rob will

compete in the 200-yard back-
stroke. Hahnfeldt will be en-
tered in the one and three meter
diving events.

In last year’s championships
Rob placed sevent in the 200-
yard backstroke and tenth in
‘the 1650-yard free style, while L
Ron failed to place in the 100-
yard butterﬂy. ‘ Sophomore

Hahnfeldt did not compete
last year.

Grady has decided not to en-
ter Rob in the 1650-yard free
style in order to save him for
the butterﬂy. Last year Rob
swam in the ﬁrst heat of that
event and 'since it was the ini-
tial time the race was swum in
NCAA competition he brieﬂ

held a national- record. '

Rob set‘ a Pitt record in the
Eastern championships l a s t
week at Dartmouth for the 100-
yard backstroke with a time of
56.8. It was good enough for
ﬁfth place. lton took a second
and set a Panther record by
swimming the 200-yard butter-
fly with a time of 2:01.9.

 Hahnfeldt was second in the
one meter and third in the three .
meter dive at Easterns.

The championships w ill
have 40-50 teams entered this
season, according to Grady.

- Teams such as Yale, Southern
California, Ohio State and
Indiana are entered and are
considered the favorites. Many

season’s individual
titlists are returning to de-
lend their titles this weekend.

lAs usual Grady refused to

» make any sort of a prediction.

“Ron and Rob have improved
this season, but the talent from
the other schools is also getting
better,” said Grady. “It’s- al-
most impossible to make a pre-

Injury Makes Johnson
Stay‘At 130-Pounds

Instead of Lower Class

An injury to 'Mike Johnson has altered coach Rex
Peery’s plans for the NCAA wrestling championships to be
held tomorrow through. Saturday at Cornell University.

Johnson, a L130-pounder during the dual meet season
and in the Eastern championships, will not be able to get ‘down to
123-pounds, the weight Peery would like him to be at.

Johnson sustained the injury to his shoulder during the
Eastern Championships, and has not been able to work out to

get his weight down. He will have to

wrestle with a taped ‘shoulder.

Tom Heniff, who would have moved up
to 130'-pounds, will now stay at his normal

weight of 123-pounds. V

Johnson’s injury may or may not be a
handicap. But Peery evidently feels he
_would be at‘ his best. at 123-pounds, since
he came in second last year at that weight.

‘The man who topped Johnson last year, V
Mike Nissen, of Nebraska, will not be there

  

HENIFF

because he "graduated, so Johnson would probably have been the fav-
orite. He' still seems to be the only real threat that the Panthers

have for a National title.

'In the NCAA there is a 115-pound _weight class which Pitt
doesn’t wrestle during the regular season. Duff Killian, who alter-
nated at 123-pounds with Heniff and who» wrestled at 115
pounds last year in the Championships, will be the Panthers’

representative.

_/ Peery, in addition to Johnson, Killian, and Heniff, will take six
other wrestlers. Frank O’Korn, 137-pounds, Dino Boni, 147-pounds,
Tom Baily, 157-pounds, Lee Hall, 167-pounds, Ken Barr, 177-pounds,

and Bi1l’Beck, 191-pounds.

, Bill Bodle the usual heavyweight for the wrestlers, will not
make the trip since he is busy with both football and baseball practices.
Although Beck has not won a match Peery feels that he should go

because of the great spirit and work he has shown.

J Lewis Looks for Starting Infield 

By MARVIN LELKOWITZ
Last year at this time the Pan-
ther baseball team had a set in-
ﬁeld. All coach Bobby Lewis had
to worry about was injuries. This
year, there is only one position
set in the inﬁeld.

Brian Fisher, a ﬁrst baseman
.who batted .270 last year as a jun,-
ior, will play ﬁrst base for Lewis
this year. Last year Fisher played
the outﬁeld as well, and only came
into the inﬁeld when John Ciolfi
had to switch to second base.’

“Brian was aflittle bit of a let-
down in hitting last year,” Lewis .
said. “But this.is his senior year.

George Prussin.

Lewis has no doubts about the
ﬁrst baseman’s ﬁelding ability, de-
spite his diminutive ﬁve-foot-nine
height. “He’s a great ‘glove man,”
Lewis said. “If a’ ball is thrown
near him, he’ll get it.”

Lewis is not as sure of his cur-
rent starting second baseman,
A sophomore,
Prussin practiced with the team
last year, but did not play in any
games. Lewis doesn’t expect him

to get many hits. “He’ll get on.

of these is Larry Szykowny.

Lewis feels Szykowny '7 has the

strongest arm of the three can-

didates, but still is not sure of

Szykowny’s ability. “I’m going

to look him over,” Lewis said."
“I haven't seen him play enough

yet to tell how good he is.”

A second candidate for short-
stop is Steve Eiseman. Eiseman
hasn’t played shortstop regularly
