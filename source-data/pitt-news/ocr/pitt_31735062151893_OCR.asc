SFA Plans

Progress

 

.Enthused Students Crowd

Room 2301, Cathedral;
Few Positions Left

 

As another 250 students crowded
into Room 2301, Cathedral, to regis-
ter for the SFA demonstrations block
which has been designed to put color
and spirit into Pitt football exhibi-
tions from now on, Lou Bearer
smiled.

And he had a good excuse for that
broad grin since, as chairman, he was
watching SFA’s biggest project of the
year unfold before his eyes amid in-
creasing enthusiasm and eagerness of
students to sign up for the cheering
section.

300 Positions Remain

“Only about 300 spots are left,”
he stated, “and the rush of candidates
this afternoon will without a doubt
ﬁll our quota and insure the success
of the venture.”

“However, just to make sure, and
to give engineers who go to seminars
Thursday a chance to get in on the
cheering, the office in Room 2301,
Cathedral, will be open Friday after-
noon as well as today after 1 o’clock,”
Bearer added.

The Block will be stationed in Sec-
tion 17, the division of the student
section which is nearest the 50-yard
line. No one will be admitted to that
section unless he presents his special
ticket issued only to members of the
block, and is wearing the blue jacket

KITTY, KITTY

What AreYa Gonna-Comma-
Kitty, Queries Shorty

 

By Shorty Long

Capering briskly at all Pitt foot-
ball games is a genial, sociable crit-
ter hitherto known only as the Pan-
ther, who pussyfoots around and
scares mountaineers and things.

But there happens to be a perplex-
ity also afoot; our Panther lacks a
baptismal name, poor thing! Hence,
Frank Carver, Stadium publicity di-
rector, and the Pitt athletic depart-
ment are in pursuit of an appropriate
bit’ of nomenclature for our mascot.
Not only will we be able to yell, “Oh,
Pluto,” or “Whiskers,” or “Fanny,’
or whatever his name turns out to be,
but we will see our Panther’s' puss
on the c-over of Pitt’s oﬂicial football
program.

Ole Jocumseh Contributes

Ole Jochumsen, the artist, built
some unique clay models of the Pan-
ther, and Luke Swank, University
photographer, snuk up on the models
with his camera, and the result is
that the football programs carry in-
triguing “pitchers” of the mascot.
Cute little feller, isn't he?

The point is that other universities
have names for the sundry animals
who cavort with their teams through
victory or defeat. F-ordham has
“Rameses II” who casts. sheep’s eyes
at the pigskin; and the Navy has “Old
Bill,” an intrepid goat. Mr. Carver
wants something on that order. The
contest closes midnight Staurday be-
fore the Penn State comb-at in No-
vember, with the prize being two cen-
ter section reserved seats for that
game. So grasp the Panther by the
whiskers and ﬁnd it a name.

Entries for the contest may be
turned in to Frank Carver, director
of athletic publicity, in the Stadium
office or in the Pitt News office.

Women Talk Freely

On Customs Exams

Freshman Coeds Originate

New Purposes Of WSGA;

List Half Of Oakland As Part Of Cathedral Site;
Introduce ‘Bride’ Of Youth’ To Alma Mater

All the wisdom and all the bright
cracks for which the downtown
papers pay hard cash don’t come out
of the mouths of babes. Or maybe
they do, if you're one of those who
call a freshman woman “babe.”

Because plenty of said cracks
turned up on the freshman w-omen’s
customs exams, which ﬁnished last
Friday.

Thyrsa Agness Amos, C38, who is
chairman of the Customs Committee,
announced that 254 women had taken
the exams; 203 passed. The passing
mark was 75, which no professor,
however tough, should sneeze at.

'The highest soores—we’l1 get to the
funny sayings soon——were made by
Betty Batty, with a perfect score;
Ruth Ruben, with 99; and Bessie Kel-
so, Evelyn Goldsmith, Alice Rough-

ton, and Dorothy Whyte, all of whom
made 98.

And now for the rib-ticklers:

One of the questions concerned the
purpose of WSGA. Three of the best
answers to this were: to create sym-
pathetic feeling toward the women;
to give the women of the University
as great an opportunity as the men;
and to teach loyalty and school spirit
to the incoming freshmen.

When the women were asked what
buildings were located on the Ca-
thedral site, they racked their little
brains and came forth with the fol-
lowing gems, which should serve to
confuse anyone who is making a map
of our campus. These buildings, be-
lieve it or not, cluster around our
Cathedr-al: Webster Hall, the Jewish

Police Will Tag
Illegal Parkers

 

The Traffic Department of the
City of Pittsburgh has notiﬁed the
University that there will be a
strict enforcement of the regula-
tions concerning parking at curbs
marked with yellow lines and in
front of private driveways in the
Oakland district.

In order to be fair about this
more rigid enforcement of the reg-
ulations, the Department has
served notice that beginning Wed-
nesday all cars parked contrary to
regulations will be tagged by the
police.

To Accept
Candidates

Rhodes Award Applicants
Must Excel In Sports,
Studies, Leadership

By William Stark

Since 1903, the Rh-odes trustees in
England have been assigning 32
scholarships annually in the‘ United
States. Never, in all these years,
h-as a University man been success-
ful in gaining one of these scholar-
ships to Oxford University.

Appointments are made to Oxf-ord
for two years, and a third year will
be awarded if the Rhodes trustees
are satisﬁed with the course of study
as planned by the scholar.

Conditions of eligibility are that a
candidate must have been a male
citizen of the United States for at
least ﬁve years; unmarried; not less
than nineteen n-or more than 25 years
of age on October 1 of the ye-ar of
his election; and that candidates
must have completed at least the
sophom-ore year at some recognized
degree-granting university or college
of the United S-tates.

Athletic Interest Necessary

The four groups of qualities upon
which selections are made are: “liter-
ary and scholastic ability and at-
tainments; qualities of manhood,
truth, courage, devotion to duty,
sympathy, kindliness, unselﬁshness,
and fellowship; exhibition of moral
force of character and of instincts
to lead and take an interest in his
schoolmates; and physical vigour, as
shown by interest in outdoor sports
or in oth( ways.”

Thirty-two scholarships are as-
signed annually to the United States,
and thestates are grouped into eight
districts of six states each for the
purpose of making these appoint-
ments. In each state there is a Com-
mittee of Selection which may nomi-
nate two candidates to appear be-
fore the District Committee. Each
District Committee then selects from
the 12 candidates so nominated n-ot
more than f-our men who will repre-
sent their states as Rhodes Scholars
at Oxford.

Pennsylvania is in the second dis-
trict along with New York- New Jer-
sey, Delaware, Maryland, and West
Virginia. State Committees will meet
on December 17 or 19, and District
Committees on December 21.

Dr. Alfred P. James, professor of
history, is handling Rhodes candidates
on campus. Dr. James is a former
Rhodes scholar. “No University stu-

Slated For Tomorrow;
Entertainment Assured

PBI’s ﬁrst “Bizad Buzzer”, an old
School of Business Administration
custom, will take place tomorrow
evening in Room 1409, Cathedral, at

Choosing a chairman for the
Sophomore Hop and hearing prelimi-
nary reports from the more active
of its committees, the executive
committee of the Student-Faculty
Assembly had its ﬁrst important
meeting of the legislative and ad-
ministrative season late yesterday
afternoon, with William Schenck,
BA37, chairman, presiding.

Bernard Cashdollar, C, Phi Delta
Theta, was selected by the commit-
tee to lead the ﬁrst class dance.
Cashdollar, business manager of the
Freshman Dance last winter, won
out in a close race over Al Kairys,
BA. Kairys was recommended for the
post of business manager.

Sub-committees turning in pre-
liminary reports were the demon-
strations block committee, the memo-
rials committee, the University press
committee and the pep assembly com-
mittee.

The memorials committee, under
Charles Rogers, C37, reviewed the
work it did near the close of last
semester, when an effort was made
to raise money for a memorial for
the Class of 1936. The project orig-
inally called (for a library window to
be inscribed with a suitable inscrip-
tion. Rogers recommended that the
window idea be discarded because of
its great cost, and suggested that a
questionnaire be sent to seniors, giv-
ing them a chance to choose their
own memorial.

Bernard McKenna, BA39, chairman
of the pep assembly committee, re-
ported that plans were “well under
way.” The rally will be held the
Friday before the Notre Dame game.

Crack Bands
V ie Saturday

At Ohio State

Attention of devotees of ﬁne bands
will be focused on the coming foot-
ball tilt next Saturday afternoon, for
the highly-touted University ROTC
band is slated to appear -on the same
ﬁeld with the equally highly-rated
Ohio State University Band.

Both bands will play and perform
to the best of their ability, each at-
tempting to show its superiority. The
University bandmen will wear their
gold-trimmed uniforms and the Ohio
State band will be dressed in army
type uniforms of maroon and grey.

Captain K. P. Flagg, drillmaster of
the band, and Lee M. Lockhart, di-
rector, promise new formations on
the ﬁeld.

Four years ago at the Stadium, the
bands performed mass maneuvers at
the last game between the two
schools. Two railroad coaches have
been reserved for the band and will
be part of a special train leaving on
Saturday morning.

The entire party of 120 band mem-
bers, officers, and directors will trans-
fer to buses and stop en route to the
ﬁeld for lunch. After the game the
band will have dinner in Columbus
and return to the city in the special

 

c-oaches.

A Last Resort

TODAY the Traffic Department of the City of Pittsburgh is-
sues an ultimatum. That ultimatum says that there will be a
strict enforcement of the regulations concerning the parking of
cars at curbs marked with a yellow line, or in front of private
driveways. Ignoring this order the offending student will ﬁnd
himself with a tag. Translated in cold terms it means at least
a one dollar fee, which in this country does represent quite a bit,
at least to most University students. .

It is readily admitted that this is the last resort. The wild
parking of student automobiles, on Alumni hill in particular, would
eventually lead to just one thing—serious accidents. Parking in
front of private driveways makes no end of inconvenience for resi-
dents in the campus district. _ _

At the same time the students can say that such parking is
inself only a last resort. Parking facilities on campus are ex-
tremely inadequate. Most of us can recall times when the local
police tagged cars for minor or technical infractions of the rules.
Such actions as parking on the wrong side of the street, parking
with one wheel on the curb or extending slightly over a yellow line
after perhaps being pushed across that line by the maneuvers of
the fellow behind, have been “tagged” by some over-efficient lieu-
tenant. .

With the concentration of classes in a relatively small ground
space, accounted for by the giving over of Alumni Hall entirely
to classrooms and the size of the Cathedral, students ﬁnd them-
selves heading for one or two centers of concentration, with the re-
sult being that it takes a great deal of parking space to take care
of the student aristocrats. A student parking lot, possibly on
Ruskin Field, may offer a soluion to the problem.

For the present, however, avoid the driveways and yellow
lines, or else . . . '

The Forgotten Men

By Irving Bennett

After two months spent in hiking
through Germany without seeing an
American, Charles Wuertenberger,
C40, thinks the next war will come
when Adolf Hitler decides to march
against either France or Soviet Rus-
sia.

Wuertenberger returned in June
from a year of study at the Ameri-
can University in Cairo, Egypt, after
a tour through continental Europe
with his brother, Spurgeon, who
graduated from the University in
1932.

Wuertenberger brought back from
Germany a close~cropped haircut and
the following observations:

“Every place we went we heard
‘Heil Hitler!’ Waiters in restaurants
said it, newsboys before they sold
you a paper said it, storm troopers
on the street clicked heels, ﬂung out
their arms, and ‘heiled.’ At night we
could hear bands of what we thought
were soldiers marching and singing.
Often they were little boys strutting
around, with steel plates on the bot-
tom of their shoes.”

Feels War Inevitable

Wuertenberger felt that the “pros-
perity” in Germany is due to mili-
tary conscription. “They take the
young men and put them in the

N our busy lives, mealtime is
apt to catch us at a disadvan-
tage. We’re often under nervous
tension and physical strain. As
a result, the free ﬂow of diges-
tive ﬂuids is slowed down. How
quickly Camels change this. For
when you enjoy Camels the
digestive ﬂuids are gently and

Freshman Voyages Overseas,
Treats International Situation

Wuertenberger Sees Hitler Preparing For Russian,
French Offensive; Americans Called ‘Suckers’ For
Part In Last War; Another Conﬂict Seen

"Germans hate Frenchmen and
Russians,” continued Wuertenberger.
“When newspapers put out extras
about a mob tearing down the Swas-
tika of a German ship in New York
harbor, there was a great deal said
about anti-German feeling in New
York. However, most Europeans, ex-
cept the Italians, don’t dislike the
Americans. Many people told me
that they thought we were suckers
for getting into the last war. Eng-
lishmen and Frenchmen told me that
many times.”

While in France, Wuertenberger
saw the start of the labor strikes.
He feels that the French are going to
move toward a very strong govern-
ment, working for powerful arma-
ments and better economic condi-

tions. Militaristically, the French
struck him as weak. He did note
preparations for war, signs with

“preparations for air raids,” and

drills.

When Wuertenberger left Switzer-
land for Italy, the Ethiopian War was
just starting. “Everywhere I could
see women and children,” he said,
“and very young soldiers parading
self-consciously around. It seemed to
me that the Italians didn’t want war
with England, but they did feel that
‘they ought to civilize Ethiopia.”

‘ Missed Spain's War

Last June, Wuertenberger started
up the Nile to Alexandria, Where he
expected to ship for Spain. He would
have come into Spain just as the
Civil War started, but at Alexandria

‘and France, and take all their wealth
and resources.

Wuertenberger feels that war is
certain to come, with either “Ger-

, :nan_v giving somebody an awful wal-
iloping, or somebody giving her the
: walloping. Her army is tremendously

powerful; her equipment is among
the best; her soldiers look so splen-
didly built that it seems a shame to
send them into war.”

says, that the Germans are very much
in favor of Hitler. “Everybody has
Isomething nice to say about him. Of
fcourse, I could hear about the con-
‘«centration camps and see the anti-
fJewish propaganda. There was a

iin the churches. But there didn’t

itional trade division in the Govern-
!ment Service course. He intends to
‘go over to Egypt in the next year
or two, when the international sit-

luation may be greatly changed.

Sutherlaiid, Angling For  

Power, Changes Lineup

Squad Works Hard For Ohio State Game Saturday;
Hensley, Michelosen May Get Starting Posts;
Bomber Shaw Rounds Into Shape

 

Angling for the strongest starting team possible, Coach
“Jock” Sutherland ﬁshed out several more changes in his varsity
before the squad leaves for Columbus, Ohio, where the season’s
biggest game, that with the Ohio State Buckeyes, is listed for Sat-

urday.

It is very seldom that Sutherland pulls his Panthers out of

their usual take-it-easy Monday after a game.

But Monday was

just another day for the squad and things really hummed up Trees

Gym way. .

Right in among these anglings of
“Jock” are the names of Hensley,
Michelosen, and Shaw. The ﬁrst two
started the opening game of the sea-
son but were not started last Satur-
day against West Virginia. Hensley
played some smart ball against the
Mountaineers and since he carries
more experience than Heinie Adams,
who had replaced him, it is a toss-
up who will start Saturday.

Another change has Johnny Mich-
elosen back in there over Arnold
Greene at quarterback. Mike only
played a period last week but while
he was in, the team pepped up and
scored two touchdowns. 'And that
counts.

Shaw May Start First Game

The ﬁnal probable change comes at
the end position where Bill Daddio
has been starting. Held out because
of a bad leg, Paul “Bomber” Shaw
has rounded into shape. There is a
chance that he will play and start his
first game of the 1936 season against
the Buckeyes, which is a nice way to
start a season.

Shaw was expected to hold down
the end post this season because of
his great work last year. But in the
spring and pre-season drills, the
Bomber’s leg bothered him, so that
when the season started, Bill Daddio
took over the position. In the two
games started Bill has done some
pretty ﬁne playing.

Two other changes that Sutherland
made before the West Virginia game
will probably stand good. Ave
Daniell will again be at tackle in
George Delich’s place and Frank
Patrick, who was not in condition
when the year started will remain
over Bill Stapulis.

Squad In Good Shape

Aside from the usual bruises and
small cuts, the squad in general is in
good shape. One or two of the boys
are limping while Dalle Tezze carries
a neat eye around with him, but no
serious injuries occurred when West
Virginia came to town and Pitt went
to town.

Interest in the Ohio State-Pitt grid
classic has reached almost unbeliev-
able heights around town. Most of
the seats out in Columbus have been
sold while all of the tickets have been
sold at the Stadium ticket office. As
it looks now, the game should attract
around 100,000 people, ‘enough to
start a couple of good poker games
and then some.

The Panther squad will leave
Pittsburgh Friday and arrive in time
to go through a short workout on the
Buckeye ﬁeld. From reports received
over the Allegheny mountains, Ohio
State University has really got some-
thing when you talk about football
teams. So does Pitt, which should
make it a great game.

Women’s Hockey
Tourney To Start

Entry Deadline Set Today
For Team, Individual
Field Enthusiasts

“Tod-ay is the last opportunity 101‘
all women interested in hockey to
sign up for the Intramural hockey
tournament,” stated Miss Jane Shur-
mer, instructor in physical education,
late yesterday.

Students may enter as individuals
or in groups as teams. Those who
wish to enter individually must ﬁll
in the blank below; others who wish
to organize teams for tournament
play may secure entrance blanks at
the WAA sandwich stand in Alumni
Hall.

To make competition keener, stu-
dents who organize teams are urged
to include as many of their former
high scho-ol teammates as they can
round up. Only four physical educa-
tion majors are permitted on one
team.

Suits and socks will be furnished
by the department of physical educa-
tion, but shoes and eyeglass protec-
tors must be supplied by the players
themselves.

Beginning at four o'clock on Oc-
tober 13, tournament games will c-on-
tinuue every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday until late in November. At
that time, one major and one non-
major tea-m will be selected from the
participants in this Intramural com-
petition to represent the University
in varsity play.

Frosh First
A Team Still
Unselected

Starting Positions Are Wide
Open On Yearling Squad
After Three Weeks

With only two weeks remaining in
which to prepare for the opening tilt
with the Carnegie Tech plebes, Coach
Mike Milligan faces the difficult task
of selecting a starting eleven from his
freshman squad of thirty aspirants.

The slowness of the yearlings in
rounding into condition has hampered
the freshman coach in early season
drills. “I’ve only had one scrimmage
to look over the boys as yet,” said
Milligan yesterday, “and as far as
I’m concerned every position on the
outﬁt is wide open.” He added that
he hopes to get a tentative starting
lineup from the showings of the mem-
bers in the two scrimmages carded
for this week.

Another Cambal

High schools and prep schools
throughout the East have contributed
to the makeup of the Panther Cubs.
Battling for the end posts are Farkas,
Windber; Dickinson, Peabody; Chal-
lingsworth, Phoenixville, and Les
Holt, from Shadyside Academy’s
strong team.

Tackle candidates include Joe Cam-
bal, brother of Clem Cambal, last
year’s freshman fullback; Hafer, Dor-
mont; Foltz, Greensburg, and Steven-
son, from up Kiski way.

Klein, Altoona; Pennybacker, East
Liverpool star; and Capurka, Oliver,
have been working out regularly in
the guard slots ﬂanking Shord, Kiski;
Piper, Schenley, and Etze, Mt. Pleas-
ant, who are center hopefuls.

Half Backs Plentiful

With Peace, Bradford; Lovitt,
Schenley; Postin, Stowe Township,
and Cassiano, Albany, in line, there
shouldn’t be a dearth of good half-
backs. Other backﬁeld possibilities
are Brundzio, Ashland, and Goodell,
Staten Island, New York, at fullback
with Kish of Tonawanda, New York.
and Naric from Benwood, scheduled
to take over the quarterbacking
duties.

Mittmen To Use
Old Stadium Oﬁice
Fo r Boxing Gym
Schricker Schedules First

Session In Two Weeks;
Paslowski Returns

An auspicious start is expected of
the Panther mittmen when they begin
jumping rope, to the tune of the
punching bag in their new quarters in
the old athletic oﬁices, two weeks
from today.

The transferring of the athletic
-ofﬁces to the old Y hut has provided
Coach Jack Schricker with the best
boxing facilities in the state. This
boxing gym is expected to be avail-
able for use at the ﬁrst practice.

Only Russ Vogel, 115-pounder;
Dick Conti, in the same class; and
Abe Konick, 135-pounder, will be
missed when the varsity men answer
the initial whistle. From all indica-
tions another University record will
be broken when the aspirants turn
up to inaugurate the new quarters.

Many Top-Flighters

Frank Bonorati and Homer Liv-
ingston head the 115-pound class. Al
Paslowski, captain of last year, tops
the 125-pounders, while Ralph Caruso
leads the 135-pounders. The other
classes show many outstanding ath-
letes ﬁghting for the top berth: Mike
Iannuzi, Herb Turner and Herb Cum-
mings, 145-pound class; Ray Bonbe,
George Kennedy, John Stonko and
George Dines, 155-pound class; Capt.
Linderman and Art Leonard, 165-
pound class; George Lupinacci and
Amil Halley, 175-pound class; Al Le-
zowsky, Ted Schmidt and Frank P-at-
rick, heavyweight class.

Capt. Cleon Linderman, Al Lezow-
sky and Frank Patrick will not be
out until after football season ends.

Intramural Tennis

Calls Stars Again

Monday, 29 netmen entered in the
Pitt Fall Tennis Tourney reached for
dust cloths to wipe off the week’s col-

lection of Pittsburgh dirt that had
gathered there from seven days of
inactivity. The tourney, scheduled to
start last Monday, was postponed un-
til this week because of rain and wet
courts.

Bud Mayer, the manager of the af-
fair, has canceled all of the matches
scheduled for this week to enable the
elimination of those not played last
weeks The ﬁrst round has been
played the earlier part of this week,
and all second round matches must
be off the books by Thursday. Those

carded for this week will be played-

next week and the entire tournament
has been shoved back seven days, but
must be completed by October 15.

Bob Madden is favored to take the
championship, although Bald and
Kristufek will not allow him to have
it without a battle. Bald was the
number three man on last year’s var-
sity and Kristufek is a freshman who
should wield the number one racquet
on the freshman team this year.

Other men of proven ability in the
tournament, but not conceded much
chance to come out on top are So-
low, Mogan, and McKenna, fourth,
ﬁfth, and sixth men respectively on
last year’s varsity.

HIS IS THE PANTHER who
turned into a lion at the Stadium
on Saturday, much to the dismay of a
Morgantown band of Mountaineers.
Leo, the lion, ran away with the
whole show and the West Virginia
lads, while chalking up 18 points for
himself and the Panthers. In all,
Malarkey made an 80-yard dash for
one touchdown, a 46-yard walk for
another and a plunge from the one-
yard line to total 18 points.
And now, it's on to Ohio State and
the Buckeye State, where Leo will

make his next appearance.

For Track Meet

Looking out of the seventh ﬂoor
window of the Pitt News office any
afternoon about4 o’clock, it becomes
quite apparent that the ﬁfth annual
University track and ﬁeld meet has
brought out a goodly number of pros-
pective trackmen. According to me
list that Carl Olson, varsity track
coach, has ready on the tip of his

ﬁngertips, there are more than 50
entries already in, with the meet,
scheduled for Wednesday and Thurs-
day, October 14 and 15, just one

week away.

These 50 men are limbering up for
next week’s meet by running over
Flagstaff Hill and the surrounding
Schenley Park territory. There are
also some trackmen using the Stadium
track to good advantage.

Although the entry ranks are rap-
idly ﬁlling up, the weight events en-
tries are still small as compared to
the aspirants in the other events. Re-
cent entries include Adam Hauman,
James Thompson, Richard Nelson,
Fred Tredennick, John Bazyk, Thom-
as Springer, Joseph Freed, Joseph
Sheehan, Dave M-oorhead, Andrew Mi-
hok, and Paul Clifford.

Officers Elected

The junior class of the School of
Pharmacy has elected its officers for
the current year. Robert L. Peel, ’38,
is president; Charles A. Britcher, Jr.,
’38, vice—president; John H. Logue,
’38, secretary, and Peter J. Silvester,
’38, treasurer.

l Well, They Meant Well!

Down in Morgantown, West Vir-
ginia, last week were a mob of op-
timists, it seems.

On the Friday before the Panther-
Mountaineer battle up here in the
Stadium, strange signs and stranger
noises were heard rumbling over the
WVU campus. Upperclassmen poked
a thumb up in the air every so often;
these were the strange signs. Fresh-
men, upon the sight of such thumbs,
yelled, “Beat Pitt”; these were the
stranger noises.

It seems that the procedure is
merely an old hill-billy custom. The
Mountaineers do it every year before
the Pitt game. The score Saturday?
Oh, yes, Pitt 34, West Virginia 0.

Speaker At Inquiry Forum
Sees Need Of Replacing
Tenement Districts

By John Martinco

Joseph P. Tufts sees Pittsburgh
facing a housing shortage. -Mr. Tufts,
head of the Pittsburgh Housing As-
sociation, spoke bef-ore Inquiry Forum
Monday noon.

The speaker traced the develop-
ment of housing regulations from the
ﬁrst laws in New York City in 1857,
prohibiting the throwing of refuse on
the streets, through the period of the
beginning of the slums about 1855,
to the New York legislation of 1900.

“Waves of immigration increased
by cycles,” he stated, “and each of
these cycles would bring a rise in the
interest in housing problems.” in
New Y-ork, he noted that the tene-
ment problem was again brought to
the fore by the series of dangerous
ﬁres during 1935. According to the
speaker, there are still 190,000 tene-
mentsleft in New York.

Cycles Create Interest

Turning to this city, he said, “Pitts-
burgh has more single-house dwell-
ings in proportion to its size than
any other city in the country. The
population is largely stable, and con-
tains fewer apartment houses and
hotels than all other cities of com-
parable size.”

“We have here,” he continued,
“6,000 oldhouses of the two-story
type that should be demolished. The
demolition, however, is going very
slowly because of the lack of public
pressure.” He state-d that at the
present time about 600 of these
dwellings are torn down every year
in Pittsburgh.”

Regarding the housing shortage,
Mr. Tufts reported that it had already
appeared so noticeable, that, in 1934,
10,000 persons delayed marriages be-
cause of inability to ﬁnd homes. “The
increase in building during the last
year,” he said, “has been gratifying
but has not been enough to take care
of the problem.” The potential de-
mand during the next ten years will
be 30,000 dwelling units.

Discusses PWA Project

Mr. Tufts discussed government at-
tempts to institute a system of low-
cost housing. The NRA provisions,
in his opinion, were not very success-
ful, but they were bettered a little
by the PWA Housing Division, which
is sponsoring 70 housing projects in
35 cities under a $135,000,000 allo-t-
ment. But he declared that “this
will not solve the problem.”

To rid the city of the unﬁt dwell-
ings, he declared that “We must rely
on public opinion to demand strict
enforcement of sanitation and hous-
ing laws, so that the families can’t
live in hovels.” Above all, he said,
“The provision of a cushion at the
bottom, in the form of social security,
is necessary for that group of people
who cannot provide for themselves,
or are limited by low income.”

Customs Exams

(Continued from Page 1)

YMCA, State Hall, dormitories, Sol-
diers Memorial, the Mellon‘ Institute,
and the Sclienley movie.

Another well-meant remark was
that Customs Committee was a part
of the Womens Self-Consuming As-
sociation. What ’was that famous
literary remark about the female be-
ing deadlier than . . .?

Someone else said that Dean Am-os
was chairman of this Customs Com-
mittee.

The women also have the idea that
they must not stroll across Upper-
class Walk because: the walk is only
for upperclass men and women, so we
might as well let them walk on it;
and freshmen can’t use Upperclass
Walk because the seniors have a sen-
timental attitude towards it.

They also think they must not loi-
ter in the halls because the “Great
Outdoors” needs you.

It would seem that Alma Mater is
not as familiar to some of them as
it should be before they pass on to
being digniﬁed and sophomorish. At
least, two of the mis-quoted‘ lines
were “Bride of Youth,” and “Thou
shalt conquer as of war.”

The ofﬁce of the dean of women
was founded in the middle of the
19th century. The ground for the
Cathedral was broken in 1260. You
didn’t know those facts, but som
freshmen did. '

And now to assuage all of you, if
it can be done, this boner——not from __

the freshman papers, but from a com-
mittee member. In marking an ex-
am, she wrote, concerning the value

of one of the questions: “This .ques- .

tion is worth ﬁve points, for there
are two women and one date.”

WSGA Commission‘
Will’ Hold ‘Round-Up’

All members of WSGA Commission
and of WSGA committees will gather
at Heinz House tomorrow evening at
5 o’clock for the ﬁrst Round-Up.

There will be no silver spurs, no
lassoes, and no corral. The WSGA
Round-up will feature a dinner, to
cost 30 cents a person, and a business
meeting designed to acquaint women
students with the purpose and work
of the commission.

All commission and committee
members are expected to attend, and
all women interested may come to
the meeting which is to follow. Verna
Douglas, C38, is chairman of the din-
ner committee, and will be assisted by

Director Carl Cass’s chief problems
with the Pitt Players this ye-ar, has
been deﬁnitely settled with the recent
additions of George Vineger, E40;
Ralph Kessler, C38, and Virginia
Delph, G.

Mr. Cass announced yesterday that
he hadialso switched positions of

pects production to run more smooth-
ly in the few practice sessions remain-
ing before opening night on October
21.

the play will be Joseph Letteriello,
C37, as George McAulifl“e, a director

talent for the theater. Arthur Kelly

est.

THE PITT NEWS

Hallowe°en Dance

Planned By Group

Although confetti and blaring
horns will be omitted, the Cap and
Gown Masquerade Dance, October
30th, will feature black masks and
all the other trappings incident to a
masquerade ball.

At a recent committee meeting, it
was decided that the general mas-
querade motif would be carried out
rather than limit the costumes to any
one design. The importance of orig-
inality in costume selectio-n, rather
than bought or ready-made designs,
was stressed.

Plans for the dance indicate that
the Urban Roof atop Hotel William
Penn will be the scene of the dance.
Price of the tickets, which can be
obtained from committee members to-
day, is set at $2 a couple. Miss Alice
Beatty, in Room 801, also William
Daufenbaugh, have tickets.

Sub-committee selections made
by Chairman William Blum are: Pub-
licity Conimittee——Ben W. Baskin,
C37, chairman; Leo Cafferty, C37;
Sam Williams, C39, and Floyd Nick-
las, C39. Programs: Al Kairys,
BA39, chairman; William Davis, C37;
Milton Brown, C37, and Ray Light,
C39. Decorations: Tom Smith, IE39,
chairman; D. C. Schultz, BA38, and
Francis Durkiii, BA39. Tickets: Ber-
nard McKe1ina, C39, chairman; Leo
Griﬂiths, C39, and Tom Steele, E37.

-and hat which SFA has made plans
to provide. Once a student is as-
signed to a particular seat, he must
sit there for every game, Bearer said,
in order to assure an efficient organi-
zation.

Members of the block may select
their seats in advance, however, and
sit with whomever they like by so
requesting when they register.

The 28 student subdivision leaders
will meet for the ﬁrst time tomorrow
afternoon at 4 o’clock in Room 813,
Cathedral, when ﬁnal section assign-
ments will be made.

The jackets and hats will be fur-
nished by the University at absolutely
no expense to the student, Bearer
said, since no deposit will be re-
quired. The ﬁrst rehearsal has been
tentatively set for next Tuesday or
Thursday afternoon, when all regis-

trants are expected to be present.

The committee, working with Mr.
William Brinker, assistant professor
of chemistry and cheerleading coach,
and the cheerleaders, are pointing for
the Notre Dame game the week fol-
lowing, and hope for a ﬁnished per-
formance by October 24.

Along with the demonstrations
block, plans are nearing completion
for the annual pep assembly, to be
held this year the day before the
Notre Dame game.

Bernard McKenna, C39, is chair-
man of the SFA committee which is
preparing for the rally. Committee
members include Albert Barr, C37;

Dean To Hold Tea

Dr. and Mrs. Charles S. Tippetts
have invited the 48 girls in the School

Dr. Tippetts is holding this gather-

that this will be a good occasion for
the upperclasswomen and the fresh-
men to get acquainted with each
other, and since there are so few
women in the school, he wants them

to meet and associate with each other.
