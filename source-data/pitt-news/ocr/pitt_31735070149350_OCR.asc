Ru es for
transgender
athletes
unclear

By Em Maier
Staﬂ” Writer

A transgender student at Pitt can
play on the sports team of the gen-
der they identify with — they just
can’t use the same locker room.
The University has two diifer—
ent standards for determining who
can play with whom, and who can
use what facilities. To use a gen-

dered facility, a transgender stu-’

dent must change the sex listed on
their birth certiﬁcate, but to play
on a sports team, they only need
to complete one year of hormone
therapy duegto NCAA rules. V
,1 The NCAA has a ‘mandated poli-
cy regarding who can play on what
teams, but the organization only’
has a set of guidelines — which.
are not mandated + for facilities
use. _ ' ‘ '

Pitt complies with the rules, but
not the guidelines’.

Pitt’s Athletic policy

In March, Pitt announced
that students have to use public
gendered facilities, such as bath-
rooms, that align with the sex
listed on their birth certiﬁcates,
regardless of their personal gender
identiﬁcation.

Pitt’s Department of Athletics
declined to comment on the con-
ﬂicting policies of team partici-
pation and facility use, referring
all questions to Pitt spokesperson
Robert Hill. M

Hill said that the University’s,

standard of requiring students to
use public restrooms and locker
rooms that match the gender of
their birth certiﬁcates also applies
to student athletes’ use of these

Pitt evacuated Litchﬁeld Towers af-
ter a bomb threat to the dormitory
on Thursday evening.

Around 10 p.m., a Pitt Emeri ,

gency Notiﬁcation System alert
advised people to evacuate Towers
A, B and C. This brings the bomb
threat count to 24 this semester.,

As of press time, the building P

not been reopened.

This is the third. time Pitt has
evacuated Towers this week. On
Wednesday around 5:30 p.m., Tow-

T er C received a bomb threat. After
2 a.m. Tuesday, Litchﬁeld Towers ’

received its ﬁrst bomb threat, forc-
ing all students to evacuate for two
and a half hours. "

Four more bomb treats empty anaemic buildings

By The Pitt News Staff

Pitt received four more bomb
threats Thursday morning, bring-

ing the total countfor the semester V

CO 23. _

Pitt sent out an Emergency
Notiﬁcation System alert around
10:05 a.rn. notifying the campus
of the four simultaneous threats at

the Cathedral of;Learning, Chev-
ronscience Center, Frick Fine Arts ‘

Auditorium and Posvar Hall. These
four threats bringthis week’s count
to 16. i '

The buildings were evacuated,
and the threats were all cleared

by 12:20  However, access to
the Chevron Science Center was

I restricted. People had to enter

through the University Drive en-
trance and were required to show
Pitt identiﬁcation when entering
the building.-

Jay Auses, assistant’ chair inthe
department of chemistry, stood
inside Chevron as two Pitt police
ofﬁcers checkédthe IDs—of every-
one entering the building; He said

that although the police were not .

swiping or scanning the IDs, that
might come in the future.

Taylor Lutz, a freshman dietet-
ics. and nutrition major, said her

professor postponed her Chem- '

istry 2 exam until next Tuesday

after receiving emails from stu-
dents saying they were leaving the

V campus.

Lutz said that putting the police
at the front door was “smart.”

“This is the next step in taking
precautions,” Lutz said. “I don’t
know what they’ll do next.” _

Freshman Kaley Hayes, another
student inside of Chevron, said po-
lice standing at the front door is
not necessarily what will end the
threats.

“[It’s]- atemporary ﬁx to make
people feel better, but it’s not what
needs to happen,” Hayes said, add-
ing that the police must catch the
perpetrator(s). “ I ,

Jerome Cochran, Pitt’s execu-

tive vice chancellor and general
counsel, is responsible for lead-
ing and coordinating emergency
response efforts,_ including the
decision to send out an ENS no-
tiﬁcation. While standing outside
the Cathedral after the evacuation,
he said the threats were sent to a

_ reporter at the Pittsburgh Tribune-

Review.

Pitt police chief Tim Delaney
said that Wednesday’s threats for
the Cathedral of Learning, Posvar
Hall and Litchﬁeld Tower C were
sent in emails to Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reporters.

On Wednesday the campus re-
ceived seven threats, six of which
came in groups of three.‘

he had no further information outside of the
ENS alert.

Resident Advisors sent "s’ti'i'dents"to'the Will ' ‘

liam Pitt Union, David Lawrence and Posvar
halls. Litchﬁeld Towers is home to more than
1,800 students. '
One Tower B resident, freshman Nikki
Branhut,*said that it was the second time she
had been forced to evacuate her room on the
15th floor. While she praised the efficiency of
the evacuation, she did comment on the fear
that repeated bomb threats create.
.“It’s scary because you don’t know,” she
‘said. “You just don’t know if it’s real- or not.”
Earlier Thursday, four buildings on lower
campus — Posvar Hall, the Cathedral of
Learning, the Chevron Science Center and
the Frick Fine Arts building -— were evacuated
after a bomb threat was received. V

All four threats were cleared at around i_

rooms.

“As this [policy] applies to use of facili-
ties, a female who identiﬁes as a male, or
a male who identiﬁes as a female, may use
restrooms or locker rooms of his or her de-
clared gender identity after he or she has
obtained a birth certiﬁcate designating the
declared gender. This practice applies to
student athletes as well,’’ Hill’ said in an
email. _

Hill said that this policy only applies to
locker rooms and bathrooms, so a trans-
gender student could play on the team they
identify with, just not use the same locker
room. ‘

Pitt’s Department of Athletics allows
students to play on a Pitt athletic team for
the gender they identify with —— no birth

certiﬁcate change needed. This complies _

with the NCAA policy that requires hor-
monal treatment but not a change of birth
certiﬁcate. -

This could lead to a situation in which
a student would play on a team as they de-
sired, but as soon as leaving the ﬁeld of play,
would have to go into a different area to
shower and change.

NCAA policy

In September 2011, the NCAA created the
Inclusion of Transgender Student—Athletes
policy to foster diversity and equitable op-
portunities for all students. The Association
changed its rules to allow transgender stu-
dents to play on the team associated with the
gender that they identify with. The policy
only requires hormonal treatment in certain
contexts and does not call for a change of
sex on a birth certiﬁcate.

But the policy has different rules depend-
ing on whether the individual is male or
female. ~

A transgender male (female-to-male)
student—athlete who has received a medical
exception for treatment with testosterone
may compete on a men’s team, but is no
longer eligible to compete on a women’s
team. ’

However, the policy states that a trans-
gender female (male-to—female) athlete may
continue to compete on a men’s team and is
banned from competition on awomen’s team
until one year’s treatment of testosterone
suppression.

“[The] policy applies to participation
throughout the year. The speciﬁc criteria
related to hormonal treatment require
NCAA review of medical documentation
and monitoring for continued participation.
The criteria related to mixed teams must
be applied in the regular season and have
implications for championship participa-
tion,” the NCAA said.

Yet those rules only apply to students
receiving hormonal treatment. For individu-
als not receiving hormones, the rules vary

' based on gender.

A transgender male can participate on
either the men’s or women’s team, whereas
a transgender female is barred from compet-

ing on the women’s team.
The NCAA also has a set of guidelines,
’ which are not mandated, whichstate that
transgender student athletes should use‘
the locker room and bathroom facilities for

_ . the Athletic
the student’s gender identity, unless they ’ _
request separate facilities.  S  
While not mandated, the NCAA issued K
guidelines to assist colleges “in creating an   S  
environment in which all student-athletes
are safe and fairly treated.” —    
confusion . ”

These guidelines state that transgender
—Julie Hallinan

‘‘I think that

“ “student athletes “should be able to use the
locker room, shower, and toilet facilities
in accordance with the student’s gender
identity.”

However, if a transgender student ath-

TTSBGH

C lete requests a private, separate changing

and showering facility, the school should
provide one. ’

“... but transgender students should not
be required to use separate facilities,” the
guidelines state.

SGB Board memberjulie Hallinan, who
has advocated for changing the bathroom
policy since the University clariﬁed it on
March 21, said Pitt’s Athletic Department’s
policy is confusing when compared to the
NCAA guidelines.

“I think that the Athletic Department’s
[policy] really speaks to the clutter and con-
fusion that the University administration
has to the status of transgender students,”
Hallinan said.

-STICKING MY NECK OUT

. Coping with romantic jealousy

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

  

In ﬁction, romantic jealousy is a
perfectly healthy and normal part
of a relationship. When you see
one character acting_ jealously
about another character’s re-
lationships, you’re expected .
to realize they’re in love.
In “Harry Potter,” for ex-
ample, the ﬁrst real sign
that Ron was interested
in Hermione was his im-
mature dislike for Viktor
Krum once he became her
beau. V
But in real life, jealousy
isn’t cute. If your best fe-
male friend vehemently
and mysteriously loathes
every woman you go out
with, it’s not a sign that

after the wrong ones and
_ notice what’s right in front
of you —- it’s a sign you need to
ditch that friend. And in the real
world, if your boyfriend is driven
mad with jealousy every time he
sees you smiling and laughing with
anotherman, you havea serious
problem. .
Out-of-control jealousy is one

‘ of the first warning signs of an

abusive relationship. If someone
thinks any of your co-ed friends‘
is trying to “steal” you or that any
positive interaction you have with
someone is “ﬂirting”; if he or she

constantly suspects you of cheat— '

ing; if he or she makes rules for
youto follow, such as expecting
you not to wear a low-cut shirt in
public or spend time with friends
when they aren’t around, that isn’t
normal. _ l C’ _
Mostimportantly, if your part-

nerlashes out in disproportion- ’

ate anger when jealous and then
blames the outburst on you for
doing whatever trivial thing pro-
voked it, then it’s likely you’re in
an abusive relationship, and you
should get thee to the Counseling
Center pronto to talk to _an expert.
Campus Women’s Organization
also has a wealth of information
on the subject.

But what do you do if you have a
jealous partner who isn’t abusive,
making rules for you or explod-
ing at every turn, but just can’t
shake thefear that every ex, every

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 

MCI‘ Campus

cute co-worker and everysmiling
barista is going to be the person
who lures you away? Or-worse —
what if you’re that partner?

Asit turns out, I am that part-
ner. It ranks among my least at-
tractive qualities, along with nail
biting and bringing up politics at
the dinner table. And like those,‘
it’s not a habit I’ve kicked yet ——
not even close. But I have learned
a few tricks to help control the
damage it might cause.

The main reason for jealous

‘ behavior, predictably, is low self-

esteem. Romantic jealousy is just .
an intense fear of having someone
you love taken away from you by
somebody else, which turns into
distress or even rage when it feels

'like it’s actually happening. The
I less appealing you think you are

as a partner, the greater the per-
ceived threat of usurpation.

The more ingrained your sense
of inferiority, the more irrational
your feelings and actions become.
I used to grit my teeth whenever
my boyfriend and I got coffee to-
gether and a pretty barista said a
single word to him beyond what
was necessary to process my or-
der — which made me look un-
believably attractive and fun to
be around, let me tell you + and
it wasn’t because I thought she

was actually going to jump into

‘ his lap if I excused myself to the

bathroom, or that he was going
to dump me on the spot to start a
life with the coffee girl. Rather,
I was afraid that the pretty
barista would draw atten-
tion to my ﬂaws, and that
with prolonged exposure
to enough pretty baris-
tas, my boyfriend would
grow unsatisﬁed with
me and realize he could
do better.

For this reason, a
lot of relationship ex-
perts advise people in

- my situation to make
a list of “Reasons He’s
Lucky” (substitute your
own partner’s preferred
gender pronoun as need-
ed) to remind yourself of
all the reasons your part-
ner is fortunate to be with
you. These can range from
the serious — such as your won-
derful sense of humor —— to the
silly or inane, such as the fact that
you both like the same dumb show,
or you make amazing pancakes.
Carry the list around with you all
the time, and read it when you’re
feeling the pangs of insecurity. If
you feel yourself starting to be-
come immune to the list, update
it or make a new one.
Similarly, you shouldn’t be

_ afraid to ask for reassurance from

your partner. Few behaviors are
more reviled than ﬁshing for com-
pliments, but there are times when
most of us’ just need the people we
love in our lives to tell us how fabu-
lous we are, and I think everybody
would be better off if everyone
were just more honest about that.

g If the past year has taught me any-

thing, it’s that my boyfriend would
rather spend 10 minutes telling me

_ I’m pretty than 30 minutes trying

to quell my anxiety attack because
his ex—girlfriend posted on his Fa-
cebook wall.

' Most important is remember-
ing that feelings aren’t facts. Just

' because you feel jealous doesn’t

mean there must be something
for you to feel jealous of 4 and
even more critically, just because
you suspect yourpartner might
be unfaithful, doesn’t mean he or
she is. This is another problem I
blame on the media: There are a

To the Editor,

Daily evacuations. Doorless toilet
stalls. FBI. The witch-hunt for the bomb
threat menace is on. Despite the in-
creased security measures undertaken
by the University, the bomb threats

have only become more frequent. This-
is a public concern, yet we students A
regard these shenanigans with nothing ,

more than apathy. And with the infor-
mation that we are given, why should
we feel otherwise?

Public safety is of utmost im—
portance, but with increased security

must come public information. The
conspiracy theoristyin ine asks: Are
there demands accompanying these
threats? How are these bomb threats
being made? Are they all written on
bathroom walls? Are they being called
in? What arethe exact words of,,these,

a bomb threats? Whatarethe —ldVetails2--if
r We could leav‘e.:¢the investigation—»«

in the hands ofthe University. We could

-keep ita private investigation. Someone

covuldvturn in a friend and collect that
$50,000 reward. This problem could

be solved completely behind closed;

  

doors with areport never seeing the

light of day.

But so far it has not. If these
threats are a concern for public safety,
then perhaps we, the public, should
also participate in the investigation.
Administration, we want to know what
you know, not what you are doing. We
can see that for ourselves. Pitt News,
this is the occasionfor you to dozsome
realjournalism.

FOOTBALL

By Brian Batko
Staﬁ Writer

Kolby Gray took the stage at Mo’s
Place, a country-western bar in Katy,
Texas, about30 miles from his home-
town of Houston, and prepared to
‘sing and play his guitar in front of
hundreds of strangers.

As a former star high school
quarterback, Gray was accustomed

. to performing ‘under pressure —

but not like this. At Pitt, Gray’s live
performances consisted of playing
for students in the Towers lobby and
singing in front of his football team-
mates in team meetings. But on this
night in early March during Pitt’s
spring break, it was time for Gray
to display his country crooning on
a bigger stage.

A whirlwind year later, Gray is
nearly ﬁnished with his ﬁrst studio
album and just about ready to put
his football-playing days behind
him. Gray’s decision to make the
precarious transition from colle-
giate football to country music was

far from a Hail Mary. It was achoice .

borne out of hard work, conﬁdence

and an unfortunate series of events
that started in 2009 when he came
to Pitt as a highly rated quarterback
prospect.

Calling an Audible

For now, Gray has put college on
hold. His typical week consists of
band rehearsals for four hours on
Monday and Tuesday nights, guitar
lessons on Wednesday, vocal lessons
on Thursday and then gigs through-
out the weekend atbars, festivals and
other venues. Rather than studying
a playbook or learning new forma-
tions, he now spends his days play-
ing gigs and taking guitar and vocal
lessons in Houston. I

He also makes frequent trips to
Nashville, Tenn., where he stays in
a hotel so he can record tracks with
renowned country music producers
David and_Dann Huff The former
discovered Gray at Mo’s Place, while
the latter has worked with the likes
of Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban
and Rascal Flatts.

Already well on his way to be-
coming a country music celebrity,

at his newfound fame as similar to
the situation of some of his former
Pitt teammates. .

“It’s cool. I like it,” Gray said of
his fast-rising recognition. “But it’s
kind of like playing football. You see
someone like Ray Graham or Tino

just try to stay humble and keep on
working and keep on making music
because that’s what it’s all about.”
More than the fame and noto-

riety, Gray said he enjoys writing .

music that his fans can relate to.
His father, Mark, dabbled in coun-
try music when Gray was growing
up, so singing was always one of his
favorite pastimes. The importance of
music was instilled in him at an early
age, prompting Gray to call himself
“a football player that sang.”

Freshman nearly
  qualifies   forOlympics

By Dexter Gulick
Staff Writer

Freshman swimmer Kourosh
Ahani missed qualifying for the
Olympics by a just over a sec-
ond. .

As soon as Ahani ﬁnished his
100-meter butterﬂy race at the
Canadian Olympic Trials this
weekend, the Pitt coaching staff
scrambled-to ﬁgure out whether
his second—place ﬁnish had earned
him a ticket to London for the
Summer Olympics.

Held in Montreal, Quebec, the
Canadian Trials are a qualifying
event for the Olympics. In the
United States, the top two swim-
mers in each event in the U.S. earn
the opportunity.

“Assistant coaches Carter
Crosby and Casmera Wick were
both there, and Casmera said she

almost started crying she was so

excited,” head coach Chuck Knoles
said. “They were both so nervous
their handswere shaking. It was a
really, really exciting meet.”

But in the midst of their ex-
citement, thecoaching staff knew
there was one catch.

, For most top—tier meets, such
as the NCAA Championship meet
or the Olympic Trials, there are

speciﬁc time standards a swim-

mer must attain in order to reg-
ister for the meet. The Olympics
are no different. There are two
time standards for each event: the
Olympic Qualifying Time and the
Olympic Invitation Time.

The top two swimmers per
event in each nation who swim
Olympic qualifying times at the
"Olympic Trials earn a trip to the
Olympic Games. If a nation has no
swimmers with a qualifying time
in a particular event, it can send a
swimmer who makes the Olympic
invitation time, a slightly slower
time standard than the qualifying
time. However, only one swimmer

I per nation with the invitation time

can participate in the Olympics.

S If the fastest two swimmers at
the Olympic Trials both swim invi-
tation times, then only one can go
to the Olympics. If both swimmers
achieve ‘qualifying times, they
both attend the Olympics. And if

one swimmer achieves a qualify-
ing time and the other an invita-
tion time, both will attend, since
one swimmer with an invitation
time is allowed to participate.

At the United States Olympic
Trials, it’s almost given that the
top two swimmers in each event
achieve qualifying times, since the
competition is so deep. Canada,
with little over one—tenth of the
United States’ population, doesn’t
have that guarantee.

That caused most of the confu-
sion Saturday night.

In the end, both the winner, Joe
Bartoch, and Ahani swam invita-
tion times, meaning only Bartoch
will make the trip to London. The
29-year-old out-‘touched Ahani by
little more than a second, ﬁnish-
ing with a 53.01.

Had Bartoch dropped seven-
tenths of a second off his 100-me-
ter ﬂy time, he would’ve reached
the Olympic qualifying time of
52.36 needed to allow Ahani to
attend the Olympics. Instead,
Ahani had to accept an alternate
position for the event after post-
ing a lifetime—best performance
of 54.08.

“I’ve never been in a senior
national ﬁnal like this before, so
it was awhole new experience
for me,” Ahani said. “There were
two thousand people in the stands
and when Iwhen I walked out and
they said my name — it was just

a whole boost of energy. And af- '

ter I ﬁnished my race, I was just
ecstatic. It was almost a second
drop from my best time.”

Ahani was joined by teammates
Renee Deschenes, who came in

— 61st in the women’s 100-meter

butterﬂy (1:o4.52) and 65th in the
women’s 200-meter (2:30.01),
and Veronica Lee, who ﬁnished
52nd in the 200—meter breast-
stroke with a 2:41.03.

On this side of the border,
another ﬁve Pitt swimmers com-
peted in the Indianapolis Grand
Prix. The meet is one of seven in
the USA Swimming Grand Prix
Series, one of the highest sets of
meets offered in the United States.

country‘ music and always loved playing the
guitar and doing things that like that,” said his
father, who also lives in Houston. ”

Pass Interference

The 21-year-old’s journey from Pitt football
player to up-and—comer in the country music
world began shortlyiafterhe arrived inoakland.
Hewas ratedas athree—star recruitin20o9 and

, among the 30-_best dual-threat quarterbacks by
_ ESPN.com. Gray had _high hopes of becoming

the next great Panther under center, but on the
ﬁrst day of training camp in the fall, something
in Gray’s shoulder didn’t feel right. He could
still throw, but he noticed his powerﬁil right
arm was gettingfatigued more quickly over the
course of a practice than it ever had before.

As it turned out, Gray’s right labrum, a
patch of cartilage near the shoulder socket,
had been torn since he was in high school._]ust
like that, Gray’s quarterback aspirations were
derailed. A’

After a mildly successful move frorri'quar-
terback to defense and special teams at the
suggestion of then—head coach Dave Wannstedt,
Gray became part .ofwhat was called the “big _
mess” that hit the Pitt football program. -

Just as the 6-foot-2, 195-pound Gray began '
to get acclimated to his new position on the
ﬁeld, he was blindsided when Wannstedt re-
signed as head coach. A ‘ ‘ *

The coach and staff who brought Gray to

. Pitt and formed a relationship, with him were

replaced by Michael Haywood from the Miami
University of Qhio. Fewer than two weeks later,
Haywoodwas terminated ashead coach after he

was arrested on charges of domestic abuse.

But Gray remained on the team when Todd

V Graham was hired as head coach following the ' '

Haywood ﬁring. He even gave it one more shot
at his original quarterback-position, but pain
and fatigue continued to plague his throwing
shoulder, eventually leading to his decision

to leave not‘ only the team but the University

as well. _

.“I already had uncertainty going into every-
thing [aﬁ:er Warmstedt resigned] ,” Gray said.
“Then when Coach Graham came, I thought
that maybe I could give it a chance and even .
try to play quarterback again, but it just didn’t
work ou .” I . V I .

Taking a Shot Downﬁeld

After another brief stint at defensive back
under G'raham’s tutelage, Gray found that his

1 ' passion for music was starting to .-e'clip‘se his

passion for football midway throughspring
training camp. I ' . ‘
“While this was all going on, I_was working
on country music and starting to ﬁnd myself
as an artist as well, so I went to Coach Gra-
ham and had a talk with him, and he was very
supportive,” Gray said. “He just said, ‘Just do
what you feel. You’re going to have a chance
to contend for a starting spot next year. [on
defense], but if [music] is where your heart is,
and you need-to go back home and transfer,

then that’s ﬁne.”’
And that’s what Gray did.

With his focus still mainly on football, he

transferred to Baylor University — just three 4

hours from his hometown — in mid-May and

reunited with one of Wannstedt’s former as--

sistants. But after spending the fall at Baylor
working out and once again playing defense
rather than the quarterback position he had
grown to love, Gray came to a realization. He
was improving so rapidly as a musician that it
came time for him to ask himself, “Do I want
to play football ‘and just‘be a country music
singer, or do I want to become a country music
singer?” ' - . '

He chose the latter, withdrawingfromschool

at Baylor and focusingon musicfull—time. While '

he can technically re-enroll at Baylor next fall
and rejoin the football team by using this past
season as a redshirt year, Gray doesnft envision
that happening. Between playing live shows
with his band, recording tracks in the studio
and continuing to hone his craft, Gray has as
much" on his plate as he ever did as a Division
I student—athlete. '

-“I wanted to take this seriously,” Gray said of
his curious decision to turn down a scholarship
in favor of “trying to make it” in music. “I knew
that for me to be successful as an artist, I’m not
going to be able to juggleboth worlds. I tried,
but it just doesn’t work like that.”

Under Review

Unsurprisingly, Gray’s decision to forgo
football —— and in turn, free schooling and
a shot at the NFL — elicited some skeptical
reactions. While his friends and family didn’t
exactly tell him he was crazy, Gray said the
typical response was more along the lines, of,
“Uh, what are you doing?”

“I don’t think they realized the magnitude of I

what we’re doing and who we’re Working with
as faras producers and managers,” Gray said.
“I think people were kind of like, ‘Oh, he just
wants to be a singer. He doesn’t want to do the
whole school/work thing.”’ ’ '

Gray said that wasn’t the case at all. He sim-

ply realized that after spending the last 10 years ’

of his life concentrating completely on football,
he had a lot to learn about the music ‘industry,
and that if he wanted to succeed, he had a lot
of work to do. if ' v
“You know what ruined it?” Gray asked.

' ‘“American Idol.’ That’s what made people think

that anybody can do it. You just have to go on

' ‘American Idol.’ It’ll be easy.”
Gray said that the guitar and singinglessons 1'. '

_ .are only a small part oflife‘ in thecountry music
world. The‘rest revolves‘ around the business

aspect of music, such as learning how to protect
himselfas an artist with copyright laws and not
getting swindled by anyone in the industry.

While Gray ultimately chose to “go with A

his gu ” in deciding to chase his country mu-
sic dreams, it didn’t hurt that he had his dad’s
support. -. C 7

times to qualify for the Olympic Trial meet
in Omaha, Neb., this June.

Pitt’s top performance in the meet came
from another swimmer who wasn’t seeking
to go to the United States Olympic Trials.
Junior Hussein Medhat, a native .of Cairo,
Egypt, pulled in 32nd in the 200-meter
freestyle, posting a 1:54.62. He was hoping
to earn a ticket to L'ondon for the Egyptian
team. -

“It was okay. It Wasn’t that close to th
qualifying time, ‘so it was a disappoint-
ment,” Medhat said. “The selection process‘

is harder if you get an invitation time, and’

that’s faster than an Olympic Trial cut. After

that, you. wait for the Olympic Committee

to decide how many people with the cut
‘ they’re going to take.” '

He also put up other strong perfor-
mances in the meet. Medhat took 49th in
the 100-meter free (52.05), 46th in the
400-meter free (4:07.64), and 77th in the
50-meter free (24.84). ‘

“He was one spot off coming back in
‘the 400-meter freestyle and it ended up
being one of his best swims,” Knoles said.

“He didn’t want to swim it, but I told him
he had to and he had a great swim.”

Freshmen Austin Caldwell andjon Lier-
ley both_ competed in the 100-meter but-
terﬂy at the event, coming in 58th (57.23)
and 34th (55.84), respectively. The two then
joined teammate Alex Rodenkirk to com-
pete in the 5o—meter freestyle. Caldwell
took 54th -with a 24.24, Lierley took 78th
with a 24.85 and Rodenkirk placed 70th
with a 24.57. - '

Additionally, Caldwell swam a 52.41 in
the 100-meter freestyle, taking 55th. This
placed him just ahead of Rodenkirk in the
event, who touched in 52.54 to take 59th.
Rodenkirk wrapped up his performance
in the meet by swimming a 1:58.87 in the
200-meter free, placing 78th. A

On the women’s side, junior and Poland
native Joanna Budzis, took 50th place in
both the 200-meter backstroke (2:23.45)
and2-00-meter IM (2:26.45).

The next meet in the Grand Prix series is
the Charlotte Ultraswim on May 10th-13th.
Swimmers will have the chance to make
more Olympic qualifying times or Olym-
pic Trial cuts-before the Olympic Trials in

bies,” his dad said. “But the way Kolby is and
the way football is, he had a lot of downtime
while he was at Pitt just sittingin dorms, and he
spent all that time practicing on his guitar and
playing songs, and he got great at it.”

V From Oakland to Nashville

Though he was nearly 1,500 miles from
home, Gray started to come into his own as
a songwriter at Pitt. Gray’s former_ teammate
and freshman-year roommate, current Pitt
wide receiver Devin Street, remembers Gray

playing his guitar “24/7,” often as soon as they

would get home from practice. 5
Quarterback Tino Sunseri, who spent sig-
niﬁcant time with Gray when he was still play-
ing quarterback, said Gray would often start
’ singing in the meeting room. '
“Whenever Kolby came in, one thing he

brought to the table was his great personality,” -

Sunseri said. “He was one of those guys that

would go into a room and really light it up. So ‘

whenever he got here, he would start singing
little bits and pieces here and there and we
would just say, ‘Kolby, what are you doing?’
Then he would go further into a song, and I

' was like, ‘Kolby, you’re not just good; you’re

great?” — a

When Gray was thinking about transfer-
ring, Suns"eri said Gray came to him to ask for
advice. The incumbent starting quarterback
for the Panthers told Gray not only to follow
his passion but also that he had a special talent
worth pursuing. ”

Gray wrote four of the songs on his album

while he was still on the football team at Pitt
and chalks up a lot of his success to his time as
a Panther. He still keeps in touch with many
of his former Pitt teammates, especially line-
backer Joe Trebitz, who said" Gray welcomed
him_to join his entourage if he ever hits it big.
Whenever he gets a chance, Gray will tune into
a Pitt game to check out what the offense looks
like and how old friends like Trebitz, Street and
Sunseri are doing. '

But Gray doesn’t watch_his former school
and long to be back at Heinz Field in blue and
gold. He said he understands that he went
with a different option, one that in his mind
actually bears some striking similarities to the
gridiron. ' -

“Music has a lot of direct parallels to foot-

ball,”,Gray said. “As far as preparation, perform-

ing under pressure, there’s all kinds of stuff you
can directly relate to it.” ‘

While his former Pitt teammates take part
in spring practice with the annual Blue-Gold
Scrimmage right around the corner, Gray is
playing gigs at crawﬁsh festivals and coun-
try saloons throughout Texas, not to mention
shopping potential singles to record labels. Like
many athletes, Gray knows he’s been afforded
a special opportunity to make money doing
something he loves, but he’ll be the ﬁrst to tell
you he still has a long way to’ go.

.“It’s super hard,” Gray said. “There’s so
much you have to do and have to learn if you
want to compete with people that are at the top
of their game. At the end of the‘ day, it’s still a
business, and I still have a lot to learn.”

Nevertheless, he’s already come a long way
from that m'ghtinKaty, Texas, on springbreak.
It was a winding road .—— one that led through
two universities and countless football practices
-—- but in a lot of ways, the real adventure for
Kolby Gray is just beginning. I
