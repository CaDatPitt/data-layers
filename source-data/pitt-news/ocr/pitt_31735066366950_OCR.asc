University StateStatus
  Delayed Till Mid-June

Senate, House Conflict

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

Money is available, but

- legislative logrolling in the

State Houseand Senate in-
dicates that the state-relat-
ed status of the University
can not be .de.termined,_,be-
fore mid—June. By this time
freshmen will have formally
accepted positions in the
class of 1970, although_they will
not know the tuition rate.
Money is no longer the issue.

Two weeks ago, State Senator
Robert D. "Fleming, ‘Republican
chairman of thevsenate Appro-
priations Committee, noted that
State funding could reduce tui-
-tion at the University from $1,400‘
to $450. Budget Secretary Martin
H. Brackbill has also agreed that
adequate money is on hand’.

‘rho postponement has arisen

._from hassling over the appro-

priation bills of the Senate and
House. Governor William W.
Scranton has said that the Gen-
eral appropriation bill must be
adopted by both the House and
Senate before the University ap-
propriation bill may ‘be passed.

A Supreme Court decision of
1932 places the University ap-
propriation in the “non-prefer-
red” category. The decision also
stipulates that the
red” appropriations be reduced
in the event that there is insuffi-
cient money to ‘meet the claims
of the general appropriation bill.

Governor Scranton expressed-
concern that students might be
“put in the possible position of
suddenly being asked to pay
more tuition that expected, be-
cause the Pitt appropriation had
to be cut due to-irresponsible ac-
tion by the Legislature.”

The Senate passed the general
appropriations bill and sent it

‘to the House on April 20. The

bill alloted $1,290,000 for general
operating expenses of the State
government. g ,
Representative 'Martin P. Mul-
len of the. House Committee on

_ ADDl'0Driations, notiﬁed the Gov-

ernor that the House general ap-
propriation bill will not be before
the .Committee until mid-June."
Still further delay is anticipated
by Representative Mullen, a Phil.
adelphi-a Democrat. The Demo.
cratic dominated House will in.
sist upon individual bills for-each
department, board, and commis.

. 's_ion. The bill adopted by the Re- '
Dublican dominated Senate may
“Qt find favor in’ the House, ac—.

'  lcofdilplgi, to Representative Mullen.

  
  

“non-prefer- .

 

University nor the ﬁnancial posi-
tion of its students canebe clari-
ﬁed.

At present the House has pass-I

ed a non-preferred appropriation
bill of $19,837,200 for the Univer-
sity. This bill provides $450 tui-
tion for all full-time resident stu-
dents, and a per credit reduction

for all part-time students.

Governor Scranton earlier ex-
pressed a preference for a plan
which would afford only full-
time residents the $450 tuition.
The Senate may adopt the Gov-
ernor’s‘ suggestion ' _

Along with the proposed reduc-
tion for resident students there
would ‘be an increase in enroll-

'ment of 1,000 students, as the

University becomes stated-related.
According to Acting Chancellor
Dr.‘ David Kurtzman, these. thou-
sand students would consist pri-
marilyof commtiters, L I
University spokesman estimated
that 400 of the new students" will
be commuting freshmen, with the
remaining 600 distributed among
upperclassmen, professional, and
graduate students. '

Dr. Kurtzman noted that the
University will. not be able to
hire more teachers to cope with
this fall’s projected enrollment.
Hovvever, the increased enroll-
ment will not appreciably change
the faculty-student ratio, which.
is presently eight to one.

More graduate teaching assis-
tantships will be offered and fac-
ulty members may take on over-
loads or increase their teaching
schedule.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

(See Editorial page 4) italic .. ..

Anthony P. Athens, as-
sistant registrar, has an-
the University's
new ' policies concerning Se-

’le'ctive Service Deferments.

Beginning this fall, the of-
fice of Student Records will
automatically send deferment
forms for University men to lo-
cal draft boards.

In order that Student Records
may complete these forms, Ath-
ens asks that all University men
check that Student Records have
both their Selective Service num-
ber and the address of their 10-
cal draft board. As soon as the
male student has paid his invoice,
his Selective Serviceform which
states that he is a full time stu-
dent, will be sent to his draft
board. -

According to Athens, Selective
Service personnel asks that stu-
dents who wish 2-Sdeferments
must be in full time attendance
and must be making normal prog-
ress toward a degree. Normal
progress is deﬁned as that pace
which will allow a student to
graduate in the normal eight tri-
mester. Athens said that in or-
der for a student to qualify for
full time status he must take at
least 28 credits or more every
two trimesters.

Moreover, Selective Service
states that in order for a student
to be eligible for deferment, he
must rank as fololws: (a) the
upper one-half of his class at the
-end of his freshmen year; (b) up-
per two-thirds at the. end of the
sophomore year, and (c) the up-..
per three-fourths at the end of
the junior year. -

Further, graduate students must

On Aptheker

 

YR’s Oppose Speech

“The Young. Republicans are
extremely opposed to Aptheker’s
speaking at the University,"
stated Peter Janszen, president
of the Young Republican College
Council. ' ‘

When originally queried about
today’s speech by Dr. Herbert
Aptheker, Janszen said that Ap-
theker should not be permitted
to speak. “This” is not the same

"as having a conservative speak.

This man is an avowed Commun-
ist‘ ‘and’ dedicated to the over-
throw of our government.”

Janszen later altered his as-
sessment of the situation, grant-
ing Dr. Aptheker the right to ad-
dress the University’s Students
for Peace. He stressed that the‘
Young Republicans certainly do
not‘agree with,.the opinions of the
national director of the Ameri-
can Institute for Marxist Studies.

Dr. Aptheker has been termed’
an agent of a foreign government
by Attorney General. Louis Katz-
enbach, according to Janslz_en.It
is consequently imperative that
Dr. Aptheker’s address be prop-
erly labeled as that of a Com-
munist.

Dr. Aptheker speaks in the
Student Union Ballroom at noon
today, concerning his unofficial

. fact-ﬁnding mission to Hanoi. Dr.

Aptheker, Staughton Lynd of Yale
University, and Thomas ‘Hayden
of Students for a Democratic So‘-
ciety alleged that the North Viet-
namese government of Ho Chi
Minh had not received proposals
for ending the war, contrary to
reports by the Johnson Adminis-
tration.

Janszen deemed Dr. Aptheker’s .

speech “not Worthy of picketing.”

0 Draft Card
Fireproofing

Conducted

Because of a bipartisan “Fire-
proof Your Draft Card” drive
conducted recently, chances are
that any draft card burning at
the University will be accom-
panied by the pungent odor of
burning plastic. More than 320
University men had their all-im-
portant registration certiﬁcates
encased in protective plastic at’
no charge during the drive.

Unfortunately, several minutes
before the program started, Pete
Janszen, president of the Young
Republican College Council of

Allegheny County, a co-sponsor

of the project, discovered that
something encased in the plastic
could indeed burn. However, cries
of “It’s the idea of the thing”
from organizers of the drive and
state senators and representatives.
present at the event soon squelch-
ed any objections on these
grounds.

Janszen noted that the project
was organized “to show opposi-
tion to the recent draft card
burnings and other unpatriotic
demonstrations.” State] Senator
Jack McGregor and State Rep-

resentative Earl Walker both sup-

ported the drive on thegrounds
that it was a “reasonable effort
to support our inen in Vietnam.”

Senator McGregor also remark-
ed that opposition to the Vietnam
war in the Pittsburgh area is
markedly light. Nevertheless, he
did not consider the “Fireproof”
project a wasted Ieffort.

The project has also been con-
ducted on the campuses of Car-
negie Institute of Technology and
Duquesne University. The re-
pons_e to the drive on these cam-
puses was also reported heavy.

Co-sponsors of the project, be-
sides the Young Republican C01-
lege Council, included the Pitts-
burgh Young Democrats and the
Society for Conservative Studies.
The General Binding Sales Corp.
provided the machines and ma-
terials used in encasing the cards.

DY-Corps Sets Programs
For Spring Trimester

The University Y-Corps is recruiting for its Spring and‘Summer
programs. Under the auspices of the YMCA, this organization aims to
improve the social environment of underprivileged children in Pitts-

burgh slum sections.

’ In these programs, University students will lead groups of young-
sters in order to -provide experi-  _ . . .

ence beyond their somewhat re-
stricted social conditions for the
children. The Corps is starting its
second year of operation and has
successfully manned several proj-
ects.

During the last two weekends
of March, the Corp sponsored a
Weekend-at-Camp for over 200
children. The Corps also: has
sponsored talent shows and other
activities which provide oppor-
tunity for self-expression. The
Spring and Summer programs

will operate in a similar fashion-

Booths are located in the Ground
Floor of the Cathedral and in the
Towers Lobby. There will be a
meeting of all Y-Corps volunteers

‘The YWCA is also developing
a program designed to help for-

‘eign students arriving this fall.

In August, within'a two-week
period of time, 400 foreign stu-

in need of off-campus housing.

 To_he1p them to adjust, under the

proposed program, University stu-
dent volunteers might do the
“leg work,” ﬁnding vacant apart-
ments in the Squirrel Hill, East
Liberty and Oakland areas.

“The foreign student will prob-
ably need help just to get to any
of these areas,” noted Mrs.
Adams. “We might set up a cen-
tral headquarters, and if a stu-
dent wants to volunteer an hour

on hand- to answer questions and
give a general welcome.”

An additional complication that
foreign students face is discrim-
ination in housing. If University
volunteers could ﬁnd out the po-
licy of certain residences, this
might prevent the foreign stu-
dent from meeting unnecessary
rebuffs when he tries to ﬁnd
housing.

Unlike the former Brother-Sis-
ter program, this new project is
short-term work, for a two-week
period in late summer.

For the interest of the Univer-
sity student body in general the
YWCA is sponsoring the “Quest
Discussion Group,” held Tuesday,
nights at 7:30 in 306 Student
Union. The program is devoted
to a discussion of various theo-
logians and religious issues -of

hates on Vietnam, the social

being steadily repressed in
the minds of most Ameri-

cans. V

 , ONE SUCH repression con-
cerns the government’s role
in aid to students in higher
education. In November, ’65

At the same time. the University is protecting the rights of the indi-

vidual. If a student so requests, the University will not release any infor-
mation concerning his class rank or his attendance status at the University,

 

Some have argued that University should refuse to release class
parameter’s, Quality Point Averages and other such information to local
draft boards. Such a position would be shear folly.

As Assistant registrar Athony Athens pointed out, when a local
board had no information about a student they will probably draft him.

The University is pursuing the only reasonable and plausible course.
In every way possible University administrators are protecting their stu-

dents and cooperating with the local draft boards.

rate over a ten year period.

Yet the FIL program has
one crucial distinction — it
switches the authority to

grant or deny‘ a loan and de-»

cide the amountfrom the in-
dividual educational institu-
tions to commercial banks
and loan associations. ’

The passage of FIL re-
ceived relatively little na-
tional attention until the ris-
ing cost of the Vietnamese
war prompted President
J ohonson to move for imme-
diate implementation. Secre-
tary of Health, Education,
and Welfare J. W. Gardner
was told to trim his budget
and in February the 1967
proposed ﬁscal budget was
presented to Congress with a
substantial cut in NDSL
funds.

Critics immediately fear-
ed desire to fully implement
FIL for the 1966-67 academ-
ic year and a drop of the
NDSL allocation. Strong and
immediate action by college
officials, students, and sev-
eral legislators averted the
implausible shifting of the
loan program to commercial
financiers. While the $190
million NDSL allocation will
now be included in the 1967
ﬁscal budget, the issue of
commercial versus college
administration of the pro-
gram ‘remains unresolved.

SECRETARY Gardner and
Oregon Congresswoman
Edith Green, chairman of
the House Special Subcom-
mittee on Education, have

been debating the issue. '

Gardner has said (New York
Times, lVIarch 27, 1966),
“Colleges are in the business
of education, not commercial’
lending. The. servicing of
loans is an administrative
burden which they cannot,
generally carry out as effi-
ciently as commercial lend-
ers” Gardner maintains his
argument despite the allot-

ment of approximately $610

million to 400,000 students
through college administra-
tion in the past seven years.

Congresswoman Green has
opposed the administration’s
viewpoint, claiming that com-
merical lenders are more
concerned with the money
than the student’s education-
al capabilities. She accused
the Johnson administration
of trying to rush FIL imple-
mentation since it “would
make the budget look bet-
ter.” Not only do colleges
have a keener perception of
the student’s needs, but there
has been no assurance that

. banks", will readily accept the

 

amount of funds for loans.

From these loans they en-
deavor to make the most and
committment of any sizable
amount to a three per cent
interest intake might not
prove lucrative. Independent

loan agencies, while not lim-

ited in loanable funds by the
government, will also hesi-

.tate before committing any

sizable amount to such an in-
vestment.

Despite the broad ramiﬁ-
cations of the FIL program,
the issue has not been placed
adequately before the Amer-
ican people. There have been
no feature magazine articles,
no television specials, no ex-
tensive radio coverage, and
only scattered newspaper re-
ports. Only when the issue
was related to the cost of the
war did it receive priinary
national concern. Now that
the allocation has been made,
the issue of commercial ver-
sus college administration is
again being repressed —-— be-
ing tossed among vulturous
lobby groups and congress-
men who are’ planning their
political future around their
stance on Vietnam. Unless a
seriousiawareness is created
among the American people,

~ FIL will remain and the Na-

tional Defense Loans - will
vanish within several years.

HIGHER education is not
the only domestic issue be-
ing camouﬂaged by the ﬁxa-
tion on Vietnam. Not long
ago, Martin Luther King ap-
peared tobe making prog-
ress with the civil rights
movement. Rallies percipi-
tated legislation and national
attention was focused on the
plight of the Negro Ameri-
can. Now the necessary fu-
ror has subsided, the prog-
ression has turned to regres-
sion, and the civil rights
movement has lost an im-
portant measure ,of momen-
tum. Strategically, its public
relations campaign has bog-
ged down and has forced
semi—involvement in the Viet-
nam issue. King has made

.-several speeches on the anti-

war theme, calling for a
peaceful settlement. Such a
move was inevitable.

_In order to refocus atten-
tion on the long-neglected
rights of the Negro, the civ-
il rights people must divert
national attention back to
their movement either by
creating internal disturbance
or by allying» the movement
with an issue receiving na-
tional attention. Injection of
the 1 civil rights movement

into the Vietnam isue, re-
 gardless of d

ijee, is a strat-
d. . .

count for King’s hesitation
to follow an aggressive anti-
war campaign involving the
full thrust of the civil rights’
people. Such a gesture could
easily allow avid rightists to
accuse the civil rights move-
ment of being subversive,
anti-American, and commun-
ist inspired.

Civil rights is an unre-
solved national problem
which has and will be ‘need-
lessly gnawing at the roots
of our freedom-loving socie-

ty. Itshould not be placed ,

in the precarious position of
trying to plan effective strat-

egy and playing “second” or

“third” ﬁddle to Vietnam. It
should not be shoved aside
conveniently merely because
the nation refuses to step
down from its omnipotent
self-image in foreign affairs.

_A modicum of progress was
being made, but theebbing

discontent is beginning to
rise again. The cause is the
same as it has been for a
century — neglect. The re-
sult could easily be a resum-

ing of riots, marches, and

protests -— a step backward
in the Great Society outline.

VIETNAM has become the
focus of heated inter and
intra-party debate and has
undercut President John-
son’s mandate from the peo-
ple. There is no longer the
unquestioned certainty "of
mass support as there was
after the late President Ken-
nedy’s death. While the Pres-
ident receives innumerable
political wounds from the
continuing war, the fixation
on the War protects him
from several political bruises
in domestic affairs. Repres-
sion of the higher education
and civil "rights issues be-

. comes a short-run political

convenience for the Johnson
administration.

With little attention being
focused on these and other
Great Society issues, individ-
ual interest groups appear
to be satiated and social
problems seem to be resolved.

' ations,

By ‘William Cabin

The mass-media make Viet-
nam~~the scapegoat for all
problems, perpetuating an
image to the public of an
otherwise progressing Great
Society. When the Vietnam
ﬁxation ceases, however, _ the
veneer will disappear and a
pandora’s box of political
woes will spring open for 10-

cal and national elections.

Unfulﬁlled and misguided
programs will be exposed
and the public will suddenly
realize the costs of the prop-
hetic Great Society; mass
media will no longer be able
to avoid dealing with the

failures of the Johnson pan- -
"acea.

‘ MEANWHILE, unresolved
domestic issues (e.g., the
War on Poverty, the labor .
movement and Taft - Hart-
ley’s 14B, the automobile in-
dustry and safety regula-
tions, and the destiny of the
railroad and coal mining -in-
dustries) are creating readi-
ly-combustable internal fric-
tion in the United States.
The longer Vietnam remains
an unsettled committment,
the more grating will occur’
among factions. This nation
will become easily torn by
those interest groups ﬁght- ‘"
ing for their promised share .

,of the Great Society’s milk

and honey. ‘

In recent months, Sena-
tors Mike Mansﬁeld, Robert
-Kennedy, Wayne Morse, Jo- .
seph Clark, Jacob Javits and
a sizable group of men with
foresight have been offering
constructive alternatives to
our current Vietnam dileI_n- _
ma. Their suggestions for in- 
cluding the N ational_ Libera- ‘
tion Front (NLF) in negoti-
holding open elec-
tions and abiding by the re-
sults, and urging negotiation
with Red China (strikingly
similar to the act recently
followed ~ by Secretary of
State Dean Rusk) may pro-'
vide the‘ necessary impetus
for ending the Vietnam ﬁxa-
tion and restoringa national
concern on vital. domestic .
issues. _ .

WHEN COMPLEIED a year from this June, the Hillman Library will

 

 contain more than a million and a half books. The Library will be
the next to a student recreational center, which will be built in the
Forbes Field area.

Hillman Library To Be
Completed In One Year

Work’ is progressing on the
Hillman Library and should be
completed in one year. Hillman
Library is being ﬁnanced by a

35::/$7,000,000 grant =from the Gener-
al State Authority and a $3-,000,-
000 grant from the family of the
late J. Hartwell Hillman, promin-
ent Pittsburgh businessman.

Celli-Flynn and Kuhn, New-
comer and Valentour designed
the ﬁve story air-conditioned
building. The second and third
ﬂoors, devoted to undergraduate
library facilities, will hold 100,-
-000 volumes and will accommo-

 date 1,200 students in carrels for
individual study.

Three ﬂoors will house the re-
search library which will contain
1,650,000 books and facilities for

1,000 students. About 70 per cent -

of the student facilities through-
out the building will be designed
for individual study. In addition,
there will be 80 small private
study rooms for faculty.

The new building will contain
several special rooms: the Dar-
lington Room for rare books, a
listening room, and a microﬁlm
viewing room. A room will be
set aside for the equipment as-
sociated. with the University’s
Knowledge Availability Systems.

To Sponsor
Art Program

The University will offer an
enrichment program in art this
summer for elementary and high
school students.

Two classes, one for children
from first through sixth grades
and the other for junior and sen-
ior high school students, will
meet at Falk School Monday
through Friday from 9 to 11 a.m.
for a six week period, June 28
to August 5.

Dr. Blanche Jefferson, chair-
man of art education at the Uni-
versity, says the program is plan-
ned to supplement the art educa-
tion students receive during the
regular school year. Because
much of the art in the student’s
experience is. two-dimensional,
emphasis will be placed on three-
dimensional work.

Students will have access to
University facilities and the Hen-
ry Clay Frick Fine Arts Depart-
ment. The program will cover the
history of art and art apprecia-
tion as well as creative art work.

Enrollment is limited_ and ap-
plications will be processed on a
ﬁrst-come basis. The fee, cover-
ing tuition, materials and ﬁeld
trips is $50 for the six-week per-
iod. A -$10 deposit is required
with each app1icati__on.

A lecture-demonstration, de-
signed to show the relationship of
adult inactivity to heart disease,
will be presented today at 8 p.m.
in Trees Hall by Bruce J. Noble,
director of the University’s Hu-
"man Energy Research Labora-
tory.

The purpose of this program is
threefold. Its ﬁrst purpose is to
discuss the nature of cardio-vas-
cular ﬁtness and how it might
relate to future heart disorders.
This section of the program will
be based on Dr. Noble’s back-
ground in exercise physiology,
that is, the effects of exercise or
the lack of it on the human body.

Secondly, the program will al-
low for a discussion on how car-
dio-vascular ﬁtness is evaluated

Classic Architeture 

day from 9 am. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m. The room is
styled after ancient Greece and features Athenian marble. gold inlay.

Eighteen International Class-
rooms circle the vaulted Com-
mons Room of the Cathedral.
This is the ﬁrst of a series on
these rooms. The Greek Class-
room, room 137, exempliﬁes the
period of highest development of
Greek art.

Two ﬂuted columns and two
pilasters of pure white Pentelic
marble separate the main room
from a windowed alcove. Ionic
capitals crown the columns, which
bear details identical with those
of the Erechtheum. The frame of
the door is also of white marble.
The Greek government donated
all the carved marble, which was
fashioned in the shop of the mas-
ter cutter of Athens.

Each of the 80 coffered squares
of the ceiling have been painted
free-hand with earth colors mix-
ed with beeswax, using the en-
caustic method which the Greeks
used on their temples. Gold leaf
was rubbed by hand with a pol-
ishing bone into permanent posi-
tion in the decorations.

The walls of marble dust stuc-
co rise above a marble dado of
polished blue Kokinara marble.
The ﬂoor is laid with slabs of
unpolished gray Kokinara.

The class sits around the ob-
long seminar table of white oak.
The apron of the table is inlaid

with sunbursts of ebony and
carved gold leafed rosettes. The
name of a Greek isle or city is
carved on the back of each chair.
Above the blackboard runs an
inscription from the Iliad: “Strive
always to gain nobility and to
excel among men.”

versity, Paul Katzen, was elected

Timmons Broadens
Recruiting Horizons

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

According to that ancient Greek playwrite, Aeschylus,
“a man must suffer to be wise.” That aging Pitt basketball
coach, Bob Timmons, has undoubtedly been suffering the
past two years. His recruiting nightmares have definitely
taught him something about the ‘quality of Western Penn-
sylvania basketball. The only question now is whether he’ll
be able to take advantage of what» he has learned.

From 1952-1964, Timmons had a fairly commendable

IIIllllIllIlllllllllllllllllIIIllIIlllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllilllllllll

A record of 144 wins and 115 losses. In the past two seasons,

 his teams have been able to manage only

- 12 victories in comparison with 33 defeats.

‘ With a performance like that, even com-

petitive high schools would be looking for

' a new coach. But Timmons has a great deal

in his favor. He has guided Pitt to three

, 5- NCAA tournaments and one NIT. He has

-.:;~,=. also won five Steel Bowl titles. By his peers,
he is considered an excellent coach.

What has given Timmons’ ulcer a rea-

 ' ‘ ’ son to thrive has been his recruiting agon-

ies. The basketball of this area d»osen’t compare, however,

  

with that of the Eastern cities, such as New York, Phila-
Idelphia or Washington.

The top talent that has graduated from local high
schools has either not been able to pass the University's

academic requirements or has been wooed away by coaches-

more dynamic than Timmons.

The nucleus of the Panthers’ starting five for the past
two seasons’ would be adequate bench strength at schools
like Duke, but their chances of starting would be minimal.
Seventeen of the 21 players _on last year’s roster were from
Western Pennsylvania.

- Timmons readily admits- that_...his._ ..r'e.,cruiting..gro.11n,(ls_

hgxoften leave a bitter taste. He has said that “Western Penn-'

sylvania" ball doesn’t compare with Philadelphia’s.”
This year Timmons has been extending recruiting feel-

ers in a 300-mile radius around Pittsburgh. Quite a differ- .

ence than the 20-mile radius of the past. In the past month,
Timmons and Tim Grgurich, his assistant before the Mar-
ines ‘recruited him last week, have gone from Chicago and
Indiana to Philadelphia and Washington.

Their swing through Washington brought them to De-
Matha High School, which has produced some of the best

:5,/teams in the country. Two years ago it defeated Lew Al-

--_ ly from the boy in Indiana.

Its star that year, Bernard
Williams, was the most valuable player in the Dapper Dan
Classic. This year Williams was a freshman at LaSalle.

. Four out of the five DeMatha starters didn’t have a
chance of passing Pitt-’s admission requirements. The trip
was worth it however for the ' '-
fifth, Bob Perini, will be
here as a freshman next
year.

By next week, Timmons
hopes to have a positive re- «

story.

“We’ve never been able to
make ’ a dent in Philadel-
phia,’,’ said Timmons. “Those
schools (St. Joseph’s, Villa-

The epitome of Timmons’s local problems’ is Pitt’s next

champion. Junior Ken Durrett is one of the top player's in
the state, but according to Timmons he has a reading level
equivalent to a fifth grader. _

“When I firststarted out coaching at a small high
school in Ohio, I was 22. I'd swea.r some of the kids playing

By GEORGE LIES —
Three teams, Penn State, West Virginia, and Syracuse,

race through Pitt Stadium Saturday to help the track team ’

open and close its 1966 home schedule.
Dominated by the Nittany Lions last year, the second
annual Big Four meet getssunderway at 10 :00 a.m. with the

V trials for the short running events. The main show, the ﬁnals, begin

at 1:30 p.m.

At West Virginia last year, State grabbed six ﬁrsts and seven sec-
onds in the 17 events. Again this Saturday, they are favored to 
“No doubt about it,” coach Carl Rees said, “they are the team to beat.”

State’s lineup shows strength throughout the, events while WVU’s
hopes lie in the field entries. Rees depends mainly on his runners,
through necessity.

“I thought we c_ould battle West Virginia for second place but
ineligibility hurts us,” Rees said. Two athletes, Dev Lemster, Rees’
[one pole vaulter and sprinter Chet Wojciechowski are lost for the
remainder of the campaign.

_ One of -Rees’ “most consistent” runners has been Dick Crout who
“definitely is the outstanding athlete so far,” said the track mentor.
“I’m counting on him to win the 220, besides anchoring our two r
lays (the 440 and the mile).” . A

Crout won the. 440 last year and ﬁnished second in the 220 only
to Bill DelVecchio, another Panther. DelVecchio established school
records in the 100 (:09.6) and the 220 (:21.6) in the meet.

Dave Eichenlaub, who ran fairly close (9:30) to his best time in
the two-mile at the Penn Relays last weekend, is another whom Rees
looks to for points. Sandwiched between two Nittany runners last
year, he ran the distance in 9:24.

In the ﬁeld events, high jumper Dave Sallach “has had a bad’
heel since the indoor season and can hardly jump,” said Rees. Chip
Rife goes in the triple jump but Rees doesn’t know how he will do
since “he has not jumped for two years.” Another footballer, shot-
putter Jim Flanigan, decided not to rejoin the team after Spring
drills.

4 Wayne Bodenheimer, throwing the javelin and the discus, and
Dave Hangosky, the shot and the discus, are Rees’ other entrants in
the ﬁeld competition. _

two others Lion coach Jim Lucas brings with him.  '

Morris Moon, who does just about everything, heads the WVU

Mountainer coach Stan Romanoski can also call on pole vaulter
Jack Carter (15’6”), shot-putter Steve Whaley, and sprinter Henry

Booted Long Field Goal in Spring Game

Aldo- Zortea’s Soccer Conditioned Toe  
Kicks New Life Into 1 Football’s Offense 

BY BILL CABIN i
At the annual Spring football game a player wearing
number 93 blue jersey trotted on the field, lined up a kick-
ing tee, booted a thirty-yard field goal, and casually walked
back to the bench. Panther fans, conditioned to Jim Jones’
weak arches, had not seen a successful thirty-yard field
goal since the 1960 team with "
Fred Cox. Surpised spectators
grabbed their lineups, ran‘ their.
ﬁnger down to the last line and
read—“Specialist: 93 Al Zortea.”
The scene was a virtual replay
of the 1965 intra -squad game
where optimistic ‘fans talked
about the 40 yard punts of ex-
soccer player Andy McGraw. To
McGraw and Zortea there seems
no reason for awe or surprise.
They just kick for fun.
“Last year Andy (McGraw) and
I were talking about kicking for
the football team in our senior
years just for the hell of it,” said
Zortea. “We ﬁgured we had noth-
ing to lose and decided to give
it a try. It was just for fun.” -
Zortea came here nine years
ago _from Enanldurt, Germany,-
with several years of soccer ex-,

‘.‘Mr. (Richard) Meyers (Pea-V

After three injury-hampered
‘years on Pitt’s varsity soccer
team, Zortea hopes to utilize his
unfulﬁlled kicking potential as a
specialist on the varsity football
team. He feels that Hart will util-
ize a good place kicker if the
kicker can prove himself. Zortea
doesn’t feel his 30-yard boot at
the intra-squad game will suffice.

“The 30-yard field goal didn't
prove anything,” he said. “I know
I have the power to kick a 50-
yard one.” A doctor will operate

i on torn cartiledge in his right

knee this month and Zortea feels

'the operation will restore full

strength. “I was only kicking at
half strength in the game. I
couldn’t extend my leg _full
length.’’

Even if 30-yard kicks are Zor-
tea’s best at full strength, he
could drastically alter the char-
acter of the Panthers. Unlike Mc-

Netters Face Big Test;
Meet Kent State Today

Coach Ben Pope and his tennis team face one of their

good showing against Kent would
give the netter a chance for their
first winning season in years.

“We hope to beat them,”_Pope
said, “but if we give them a good
battle, that’s O.K.” Kent has three
starters back from a team that
has trounced the netters the past
two years by identical 9-0 scores,
but Pope is unwilling to compare
those teams to his present outﬁt.-

“In some of these matches for
the past two years the other col-
leges thought our boys were just
out there modeling their under-
wear” was Pope’s comment on
his last two teams which won a
combined total of two matches.
But this year Pope has a much
stronger team.

Much of this improvement, the
coach attributes to the competi-
tion among the top four men.
“All are very close to being top
man,” he says of Bob Nichols,

State at the Tech courts at 3:

00 p.m. According to Pope, a

and Bob Goldstein. Of their com-
petitivenes, Pope says, “You can’t
beat the enthusiasm they have
for playing and competing.”

Pope’s enthusiasm is only damp-
ened by the realization that, al-
though they have come a long
way, the team still has a long
way to go. “They still make er-
rors—more errors than place-
ments,” Pope relates unhappily.
But if enthusiasm can win a ten-
nis match, then Pope is sure that
his boys will upset Kent.

.3‘,

Three games in three days,
beginning tomorrow against
Westminster, are scheduled
for the baseball team. Fri-
day they meet Duquesne and
Saturday, the mitters play at
Bucknell. The daily action may
prove tiring, but it may also help
them forget Monday's 1-0 loss at
West Virginia.

Winning their 18th in 24 games,
the Mountaineers could not get
a ball out -of the inﬁeld in the
first eight innings against lefty
Dave Welty. All the threat they
could muster were two bunt sin-
gles, one in the sixth and one
in the eighth inning. In the last
of the ninth, however, a few
things happened.

WVU’s first man up hit a ball
which stopped dead in left cen-
terﬁeld for a double. Welty spell-
ed the next man for his eighth
strikeout of the contest. The
third man hit a dribbler, which
went right between third base-
man Tom Beckett and shortstop
Steve Kienzl.

Phil Nashrallah, the leftﬁelder,
came up with the ball and saw
the man on third holding the.
base, but the. man on ﬁrst trying
for second. Nasrallah threw to
Steve Eiseman covering at sec-
ond. The ball got away. The run
scored, and coach Bobby Lewis’
team suﬂered its third loss. The

mitters have three wins.

From his position on the side-
lines, Lewis saw the play and
said, “the ball looked like it hit
something, it took a crazy hop
away from Eiseman and the run
scored.”

Eiseman felt differently. “On
the play I could have either tried
to scoop the ball and tag the run-
ner for two outs, or play it safe,
knock the ball down and hold
the runners,” he said. “I tried to
make the tag and the ball hit off
my glove. If I had it to do over
again, I would have done it the
other way.”

Beckett, two hits in four at
bats, and Nasrallah, two for
three, led the hitting attack
against righthanded curveball-er
Charlie Wallace who won his
second game without a loss. Wal-
lace gave up six hits to Welty’s

four. “The. game was well pitch-
ed on both sides,” Lewis said.

Except for the mitters’ sick hit-
ting attack, Lewis was pleased
with “the overall play” and call-
ed it his team’s “best game” to
date. .

“If we play like this, we will
have no trouble winning,” Lewis
said.

The University’s School of Medicine will hold a Student Scienti-
fic Day at 4 p.m. Monday in the Scaifc Hall auditorium.

This annual event provides an opportunity for outstanding stu-
dent scientists to present formal reports of original research projects
they conducted during the University's Summer Research Program.

Selected for the honor this year are: junior John J. Lambcrti,
Jr., of Yonkers, N. Y.; sophomore Larry E. Hurwitz of Butler, Pa.;
and sophomore Jacob C. Fan of Hong Kong.

Mr. Lamberti’s research, “On
the Quality of Blood Pressure.
Regulation Afforded by the Caro-
tid Sinus Reﬂex in the Intact,
Conscious Dog,” was supervised
by Dr. John Urquhart, assistant
professor of physiology.

Mr. Hurwitz’s research, which
was sponsored by Dr. Jordan D.
Haller, instructor in surgery, was
entitled “Effects of Perfusion and
Low Molecular Weight Dextran
Addition on Tissue Water and
Electrolyte Content of Isolated
Dog Kidney.

Mr. Fan, whose research in-
volved the “Mechanism of Trans-
fer of the Resistance Transfer
Factor in Escherichia Coli,” was
supervised by Dr. Charles C. Brin-
ton, Jr., professor of biology.

The three students were among
some 70 future physicians to par-
ticipate last summer in the Uni-
versity’s research program. Each
participant receives a $750 stip-
end in the program, which is sup-
ported by a grant from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health.
