The Executive Committee

unanimously passed a reso-
lution June 29 concerning

to the controversy arising from

University‘s state affiliation and
the deterioration of academic
standards which would follow.

During the administration of
Governor David L. Lawrence, he
was ‘secretary of administration

The decision followed testimony by Gwilym Priceychaimianv of”-

its regular $5.8 million grant from;

chairman of the Budget-Audit Committee, as well as questioningby .
members of the Board of Trustees and state legislature. 4

Explaining the University’s $19.5.million deficit, Denton pointe
out that a ten year forecast made in 1960 predicted income from
grants and tuition but had to be updated in -1951 to acknowledge},
losses. V .. . ’ , 

He stated that Chancellor Litchﬁeld had prepared these “unreal-
istic” forecasts and operating budgets without the help of either the:
comptroller or the treasurer of the University. I I

He continued that there has been .a “propensity fon borrowing.’
from one fund to another”_and that there ‘had not been “adequate.” .V
controls” over the Chancellor’s budgeting. ' A ? *

The board members, who were not “versed -in the ﬁnance of.
accounting,’-’ were “partners in crime” with the Chancellor when
Denton became budget-audit chairman in‘1963~. “The situation _wa

Dr. Johnson's study will center
mainly on how the Russian- edu-

‘worse than we feared," he said;
Price noted that the. University‘
borrowed $10 million in 1961,to
supplement the capital and esti-‘
mated it could pay back‘ the; loan
in ten years. It 1 had to borr
another $5 million in 1963. Hind

made.
A projected deﬁcit for the ﬁs
cal year 1963-64 of $398,000 iii.
May, 1964, became a_ reality "of:
$5.1 million in October. All 'avai1- ._
able cash was used by the end.
of last year ‘including $2 million"
from endowments. The Universi-
ty borrowed $1 million in Decem-,-

$918,000 in May to pay part of
the payroll,. Denton said._ , ;
Price continued that this year"
there is an operating deﬁcit or
$2.5 million which the Universi
ty has tried “every possible

out that the sale of Forbes Field“ -7
would not be worthwhile andfj
that the University's assets of

Dr. Johnson, who visited the
Soviet Union six times and taught
there for three years before
World War II, said that the Rus-
sian school system changed since
l963 when Khrushchev was still
in power. '

Russian children attended
school from age seven to 18 in
the 11 year program then in ef-

ten years, as it was in 1958. Dr.

ednesday with the testimony ‘of F"I'ank‘
. _n_ton before the state House Appropria-
ti ns Committee. Denton, a memberof the
ard of Trustees, and chairman of the
*'l3oard’s‘ Budget-Audit Committee, gave’ :,
wonderful lesson to all present on how "to
pass the buck. If the comments of the state

Committee members following his testis, .
_m'o_ny were any indication, Denton’s exam-
” ple was very successful-

Iiitchfield was not present at the meeting, -
because‘ it would have been much more dif-
ficult _t’o's=mea-r him in his presence. Denton
gave a‘ beautiful. performance, portraying
the guilt of one man, solely responsible for
the ﬁnancial errors of judgment of an ‘entire
. university. In an unexplainable moment of
generosity andltruth, Denton--did have‘ the
decencyi to add -that the trustees were
“Partners in crime, as it were.” The general
tone of his testimony left no doubt of the
trustees” public opinion of the Chancellor
and his relationship to _theiUniversity’s ﬁ-
ﬁnancial difficulties. W N i
Although Denton’s testimony was un-'
necessarily» and unfairly damaging to the

say that Dr. Litchfield is not asleast par-
tially to blame. For the Chancellor to (iii-
struct budget projections without consﬁlt-_
ing the comptroller or the treasurer of the

. University is a very serious error. But, and
as Denton so conveniently neglected to men-
tion, for the Board of Trustees to permit
such a situation ‘to persist is an equally
grave error, if not more so. ’ '

' Where was the Board of Trustees all the
time that Dr. Litchﬁeld was supposedly
running the University all by himself? Just

It would be asking too much to expect
the University to keep‘ Dr. Litchfield as
chancellor after the way he was blasted by
the trustees. In view of the great advances
that he has instigated hére,_it is most un-_
fortunate. that he must now become the
scapegoat. We salute the contributions of

Doors To Close With

meeting, Acting Chancellor Stan-
ton Crawford explained that the
faculty has “the biggest stakes”
in the question of money.

He read a letter from'the fac-
ulty of the Schools of Engineer-

’ ing and of Mines which stated the

faculty's “‘unanimo’us approval of
the increasing standards of ex-
cellence” at the University. The
faculty would concurwith closer
University ties with the state
“provided this does not compro-
mise objectives of thepursuit of
excellence.” ‘

Representative Edward McNal-
ly, who introduced the amend-
ment which made the grant a

part ‘of the University's "regular
allocation, objected to the total’

of $12‘ million which the Univer-
sity will have received by the
end-‘of 1965 if it ‘receives the
extra $2.5 million.

“If the Committee picks Pitt
up and writes it off it will put it
on a higher plane than it is now,”.
he said. “They says (sic) they
need money. This is taxpayers
money. The University of Penn-

sylvania don’t (sic) need money,"
he continued.

Rep. McNally noted that writ-
ing off the University would be
the “best thing that'ever happen-
ed to the Commonwealth.” In
response to Price’s suggestion
that the University help staff two
and four year community col-

 

out More Aid

leges rather than become a state
institution which could ldwer
standards, he declared that C
students are “the backbone of
the nation and know how to
meet people.”
