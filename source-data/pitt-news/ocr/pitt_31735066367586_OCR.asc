Officers
Take Oath

.The four victorious» candi-

dates in. the ﬁght for Men’s,'

Council positions took their
oath of oiﬁce in a ceremony
last Friday.

Stephen Johnson, Arts, in,
Charles Lebovitz, Arts, soph.,
Stephen Pearson, Arts, soph., and
Thomas Mellers, Arts, fr., accept-
ed their positions of president,
vice-president, secretary, and
treasurer, respectively.

Traditionally, Men’s Council’s
board contained -a ﬁfth man, who
was picked byithe four elected
officials. .

Pearson feels that this ﬁfth man
post should be ﬁlled by Ralph
Marina, Arts, sr., the runner-up
for the position of president.

Johnson said, “Itis my desire

to change the constitution of

/Men’s Council so that everyone’

may vote. If this is done there
will be no need for a fifth, man,
whose principle function was no
more than that of a tie-breaker."
Johnson added that he would
like to increase. the role played
by MC in Orientation Week and
Men’s Conference, as well as ex-
change representatives with the
Senate, AWS, and IFC.
“I would like to help make
z lVIen’s Council beter known. Many
of the fellows whom I as_ked to
vote for me, had never even heard
of it before,” said Mellers.

Dave Higbee, Engr. fr., and Bill
Haeflein, Engr. soph., moved into
test rooms last Thursday.

The students were selected from
a list of all those who had ex-
pressed an interest in testing the
new rooms to their dormitory
counselors. The counselors recom-
mended those students whom they
felt b_est represented the male stu-
dent body as a group to Donald R.
Van Houten, director of Men’s

“Housing and Jerry Whalen, Head
Resident.

When asked how he liked his
new room and why he applied to
test it, Ronald Billey replied, “It
is very comfortable. The rooms
have a real study atmosphere.
They seem to be just made for
study with their pleasant design
and complete lack of outside dis-
tractions. I volunteered to move

*because I wished a change in en-
vironment.”

CHANCELLOR EDWARD H. LITCHFIELD
of leadership.

Chancellor Litclifield (lives
Challenge of Leaderisllip

Aftercongratulatin-g students for their honors‘? received

 

on Tap Day, Chancellor Litchﬁeld challenged those same stu-
dents seated before him at the noon hour program Wednes- _
day to_culti.vate those qualities of leadership now so nec-

ers with the ability to construct
goals and to keep their attention
focused on those goals.

“There is no leadership involvi-
ed in being in front of a mob that
knows where it is going regardless
of who’s in front,” he said. “Lead-
ership is a mode of behavior that
must be cultivated,” “It means
standing for something even
though it may involve unpopu-
larity or even isolation.” 0

He pointed out that popularity

ship. “Maintaining the strength

5
ofour own convictions isnot an
easy thing. There is always the
gnawing uncertainty. whether or
not were right.”

He compared the real ‘leaders
with the men in the grey ﬂannel
suits who are the symbols of the
great institutions, all of which
seek conformity. “In these great
institutions,” he said, “it is dif-
ficult to exercise-leadership.”

In the light of the present pow-
er struggle, Litchﬁeld said that
we are competing with a society
which postulates a monolithic
society.

Engineers’ Week Histor

Ci;iapl.ai.u Lmt(toci{
Initiated First
F(,‘,t(f.‘ In 1954

By AL .1onNsoN

We are now czelebrating the
eighth a n n u a 1 Engineers’
Weelc at the University. Sev-
en years ago the Engineers
made their initial step in let-
the public know that
they exist.

Chaplain Emory W. Luccock
initiated the first En£>;incer’s Week
on a Tuesday at the inter-denom~
inational chapel service. The Sky--
scraper Engineer published a spe«
cial edition for the event, St. Pat-
rick arrived on Wednesday by
truck, and a high school open
house was held Thursday evenino‘.

The Week was climaxed by the
Shamrock Ball at the ‘West View
Park Danceland. During‘ the inter-
mission at the ball St. Patricia
was crowned, the Shamrock
award was given to the engineer-
ing deépartment twhose displays
were considered best by the visit-
ing high school students.

Most of of the activities they
had seven years ago are still be-
ing repeated by the 1961 Engi-
neers’ Week. St. Patrick makes his
arrival, the Skyscraper publishes
their special edition, and the high

schools in the area are invited to I

see the displays.

The Shamrock Ball is still the
concluding annual event at which
St‘ Patricia is crowned and the
Shamrock award and other
awards are made. This might be
taken as evidence that that first
Engineers’ Week. left a lasting ;irn~
pressicn which will probably last
as long as there are Engineers at
the University;

Each year St. l‘atric:k arrives
by a different mode of tiransporta-
tion. The first yeai, which was
.1954 he arrived by <.i1n'np truck,
in 1955 by w}Ji2,‘lybird_; the next
year he showcol his military in»-
clinations by arriving on a tank,
in 1957 his trarisporiation was a
covered wagoni

In 1958 he came l:»y_ jeep, in

1959 under the influence of the

space age he arrived by missile,
and last year he came up through.

Each year a theme for Engi-
neers’ Week is chosen which ex-
empliﬁes what engineers are do-
ing, have done, and will do.

with a glowing future

At Gen Tel, research is put to work to advance
communications through sightas well as sound

The dial of our compact Smrmr£* phone, for
example. utilizes an entirely new source of light
that marks a milestone in visual communications.
Called PANELEscENT® (electroluminescent) lighting,
it produces light without heat, has no bulb to turn
on and off, and costs less than lo a year for
electricity. .

Pioneerecl and developedwby the Lighting Products
Division of our subsidiary. Sylvania. this dramatic
new light opens up almost infinite product possiw
bilities in sight communication. Already it is being
used for clock faces, radio dials, auto instrument
panels and road signs.

And. through the development of an, ingenious
“‘cross—grid" design, electroluminescent panels are
now capable of reproducing alpha-numeric “reade
outs” for electronic computers. This achievement,
in fact, may one day lead to "flat in/all" TV.

It is another example of the way General Telephone
& Electronics coordinates the scientific and engl»
neering leadership of many divisions in order to
, make communications progress on all fronts.

, Outspoken Leader

Page’ 4 —— *r1n:‘rrr'r NEWS’,-—l Monday,‘ March‘ 13,. 1961'. I

  
  

Harry “Woody” Turner

 

 Brave Word

A leader must often make statements which are con-
troversial; these statements may result in the leader" be-
coming unpopular. ‘T

Last Wednesday, at the Tap Day banquet, Woody
Turner addressed an audience composed of administrators,
faculty members and student leaders. He spoke for 45 min-
utes on truth and the University. .

We aren’t concerned with the students, faculty mem-
bers and administrators who congratulated Turner for mak-
ing this speech-—but rather we are concerned with the ones
who didn’t. Three criticisms offered by them seem worthy
of consideration. a . ’

‘The ﬁrst pertained to the appropriate time fora frank
criticism of administrative policies. Did Turner‘ have the
right to speak on “To the End‘ of Reckoning” at a Tap Day
dinner? Was the essence of his speech disrespectful?

Obviously the speech Tu-rner gave doesn’t coincide with
the oratory‘ usually heard at banquets. But then, Turner is
not the type of person who would give a speech that would

1 praise student leaders for being leaders.

Yet even if the contents were not quite apropos, the as-
similation of studentleaders, faculty members and admin-
istrators (Chancellor Litchﬁeld, Dr. Swartzbaugh, Dr.
Crafts and Miss Rush),provides the audience to which such
a speech would be worthwhile. This is the audience that
should be concerned with the problem areas discussed by
Woody Turner. Since leaders from every University divi-
sion are brought together only once a year, we believe that
the speaker’s time was well used.

Another criticism voiced was that Turner’s speech was
a direct insult to the guest of honor, Chancellor Litchﬁeld.
Since one is seldom given the opportunity to speak before a
group of students when the Chancellor is present, we
disagree. v _

We don’t think that the speech was by any means
planned as a direct insult -to him, and we think that Dr.
Litchﬁeld would agree with us here. .

Turner has been compiling the 26-page oration for the
past four months — it is a result of four years of active
participation at the University. He didn’t spend 45 minutes
telling what he liked about the University, but rather what
he didn’t like. It reflected constructive criticism, and was
stated apparently because problem situations do exist and
are being ignored. ,

No doubt, the Chancellor would have preferred that

Turner discuss these problems in some other manner, but

we don’t think he would ever, take this speech as a personal
insult. ' .

The third criticism of Turner’s speech was that it was
a «personal attack on Dr. John Geise, assistant chancellor of

student affairs. - _
Turner didn’t make a personal vendetta, but criticized
the actions of Dr. Geise.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to speak with.

Dr. Geise realizes immediately that they are talking to an
intellectually-giftced man. He is a historian and academician
who deﬁnitely belongs in our University; he is deserving of
defense against any personal attack.

Turner by no means tried to discredit the personality
of this man, but through the speciﬁc instances he cited,
t.ried to show how theundiplomatic actions of Dr. Geise in
his relations with students, faculty members and other ad-

ministrators hindered the actions of these groups or indi- .

viduals -in solving University ‘problems - the groups and
individuals that he as an administrator should be serving.

Each of the three criticisms are worthy of defense,
either pro or con. We have presented the con in order to
illustrate why Woody Turner made this speech. .

Woody Turner deﬁnitely presented “a speech” that will
not be forgotten quickly, we hope, and that is indicative
of the actual. problem, the lack of communication, between
the administration and the students and faculty.

 

(Editor’s note: Harry Wood-
ruﬁ‘ Turner, Mr. Pitt 1961, was
selected by the Tap Day Com-
mittee to speak at their eve-
ning banquet. We have printed
his speech almost completely
because we feel that what Mr.
Turner said at that dinner is
iiid.icative of many problems
at the University.

Woody Turner: The remarks I
propose to make this evening
could be described as concern-
ing truth and the University. I
am aware of the intricate pro-
blems involvedpin the discussion
of truth. .It is elusive of deﬁni-
tion, and, men such as Russell
who have pointed out the diffi-
culty of perceiving even the
realityof a chair or table, should
oblige us to approach the ques-
tion of truth with considerable
caution. I would like to avoid
epistomological problems this
evening, therefore, I hope we can
agree to regard truth as‘ some-
thing even simpler than the
“system I of hypotheses validated
by experience” which is a sug-
gestion of A. J. Ayer. I would
prefer, in short, that you would
regard my usage of the word
“truth” in its most ordinary,
common-sense application as be-
ing a quality which we describe
as honesty or the adherence to
ethical standards. however de-
rived, in the making of value
judgements and in the conduct of
human life.

It would seem that in this
sense, truth would be the goal of
a University. ‘

(Editor's note.‘ At this point,
Turner quoted Carlyle, Alvey
and Jacob, each of whom‘ dis-
cussed the essential need for
ind.ivid'ual integrity and hort-
esty in any ijnstit-u.tio~n in order
for that institution to survive.)

Turner continued: I would
argue, -on this basis, that a Uni-
versity I has . the unavoidable

function of serving as an ex-

ample _of institutional integrity
and honesty. I would further
suggest that the agents, admin-
istrative or otherwise, of the
University must endeavor to, by
their example and teaching, be
extra ordinarily sensitive to the
inﬂuence they can have upon
undergraduates. It would follow
that a University official or
teacher ought, indeed, be a par-
digm of truth. ’

This evening, I would like to
give rather brief consideration to
our University in connection

with this function of a Univer- ,

sity. Since I came to Pittsburgh
four years ago, I have ‘been wit-
ness to some truly great strides
in some areas of the institution.
We have seen: 1. Substantial
improvement of faculty; 2.
More rigorous requirements
from most individuals-—hence
greater utilization of individ-
ual capacities; 3. What appears
to be improved entering fresh-
mcn—bringing‘ better minds
and diverse backgrounds; 4.
The growth of campus living
and its beneﬁts. _
Each of -these developments,
and others I have not time to
cite, would clearly seem to equip
the institution to more adequate-
ly pursue the knowledge of sci-
ence, the nature and achieve-
ments of man, and of human so-
cial institutions. Butit should be
evident that none of these ad-
vancements relate in any respect
to the University’s capacity to
provide for installing qualities
of personal integrity into her
students and
qualities which accompany many
freshmen to the doors of the
Cathedral. To the contrary, it
will be my suggestion this eve-
ning that, by pronouncement and
example, the University has

reinforcing the “

 To ’rhe End of Reckoning

hindered the proper pursuit of
this primary function of the aca-
demy in society.

With your permission, I would
like to approach this difficult
matter by addressing myself to
three areasof shortcoming which
I describe as follows:

1. The Burden of Bureau-
cracy and the search for Truth.

2. Academic Ethics: The
Myth and the Crisis.

3. Truth and the Trimester:
A Case Study.

Wherein lies the relationship
between Truth and Educational
Burgau'cracy‘.’ Our friend, Miss
Ina Amdur, writing in The Pitt
News cites a speaker at the
Ame1'ican’College Public Rela-
tions Association, who declared:

“We have shared with industry
the gloriﬁcation of the executive
and the organization Yhan and
thus have introduced into the ed-
ucational system the values of
the market place.

“The plain truth of the matter
is that administration exists for
the purpose of allowing the real-
ly important people — the fac-
ulty members and students — to
get their work done. The success
of an administration lies in the
degree to which it inconspicu-
ously provides the environment
and facilities with which instruc-
tion and research can be carried
on.” A

I would indeed be astonded
if 2il’l_YOl'l€_,-‘VVOUlCl deny the pro-
position that University admini-
strations exist only for the pur-
pose of serving the faculty and
students. I am unaware that any
other reasons could be adduced
to justify the existence of ad-
ministrators. If we would look
to the great institutions of Eu-
rope, we would discover that
only a few administrators are
required to provide communica-
tion between a group of students
andsome faculty members. It is
seldom alleged that these stu-
dents receive inferior education
or that their failure to receive
the expensive ministrations of
hundreds of educational bureau-
crats constitute a threat to their
intellectual welfare.

At our particular institution
thcbureaucrat has been raised
to’ an unfortunate plateau.
These executives often regard
students and teachers as nui-
sances, without whom they
could better and »more easily
fill out their forms and ﬁle re-
ports. VVe have vice chancel-
lors and assistant chancellors
in excess of any institution I
have discovered. Each of these
is surrounded with a ﬂock of
administrative assistants, ex-
ecutive assistants, and other
persons, well adorned with ti-
tles. In the category known as
deans and directors, our di-
rectors positively exx c c e d,
quantitatively, of course, those
of any private institution» in
this land, and with each di-
rector we discover a multitude
of assistant and associate ‘di-
rectors, secretaries, stenogra-
phers, clerks, receptionists.

In short we have seen arise in
our midst, a “New Class” of
academic parasites, whohave mi-
totically grown in accordance
with Parkinson’s Law.”

Turner then quoted the follow-
ing lines frm “The Decay of the
Academy” by R. ~P._ Oliver:

‘It is a biological fact that par-
asites, if not checked,.multiply
until they destroy their host. The
process by which ‘bureaucrats

multiply in government has been

paralleled in the colleges. The
ever-growing swarm of directors,
counsellors, advertising experts,
and statisticians instinctively
seek to build larger nests, they

strive to abolish the few remain-
ing standards in order to expand
the market for diplomas’. They
instinctively see in every under-
graduate an infant who ncctls a
nurse. and in every teacher a
hired hand who needs a super-
visor.”

In the area of student affairs
the recent administrative popula_
tion ex=pl*0sion has, proportion-
ately, rivaled that of India. In
this area, I suspect that persons
of all religious persuasions can
advocate the application of tech-
niques to‘ control the problem.
The Student Union staff, for ex-
ample, has already burst from its
original office space and in order
to house the growing number of
necessary incompctcnts required
to amuse our University stu-
dents, they have been obliged to
dislodge some of the groups they
are alleged to be serving from
their accommodation. The pro-

vision of such amusement would ‘

be regarded with contempt in a
British institution and, «gindced,
was performed here until recent-
ly by one man in an altogether
adequate fashion.

The problems created are
these:

1. Each executive, since they
are not dollar—a—_vear-men, di-
verts funds from the legitimate
and primary functions of the
University each time he is pay-
ed.

2. In order to justify their con-
tinued existence, they create
paperwork which constitutes a
problem for faculty members
and absolutely consumes depart-
ment chairmen.

3. Butthe greatest detriment is
that the bureaucracy gives rise
to the second major area con-
cerning truth that I would -like to
consider’:-

There exists a general belief
that persons connected with uni-
versities should be and are of
high moral character. This is the
myth. I wish that this opinion
could have been more universal-
ly established on the basis of my
experience at Pitt. As Miss Do-
linar wrote in her ﬁnal column
in The Pitt Newsf

“Most of the administrators
from the bottom to the top of
the complicated hierarchy,
have one characteristic in

common: They lack ethical
standards. By subtle decep-
tions they aim to mislead stu-
dents and discourage any ini-
tiative that a student might
have.

“I have had members of the
administration tell me privately
that they strongly agreed with a
particular stand taken by The
Pitt News. But,‘ when in the
presence of a higher administra-
tor, who disagreed with the
stand, they suddenly changed
their minds ﬂand decided that
The Pitt News was wrong.”

Rather than simply reiterate
her gen_eral charges, I would like
to examine some case studies in
order_ to illustrate some gener-
alities with speciﬁcs, "wishing,
however, to make clear that
there are many men and women
on the staff for whom I have
developed deep respect and upon
whom no adverse reflection can
be cast. V '

1. The recent discussion
concerning racial discrimina-
tion on the campus serves as a
useful example. Phil Brown
and I had talked with Assist-
ant-Chanccllor John Geise
concerning the problems ‘in-
volved. Substantial discrepan-
cies appeared between his re-
ports to us individually. When
questioned by a Pitt News re-
porter latcr, he not only de-
nied knowledge of any such

 

an .
t

~ .-

   

problems, but he also failed to
recollect any discussion of such
a matter. He advised _me, for
cxaffnple, that the student gov-
ernment could not, in his judg-
ment, assume jurisdiction over
fraternity discrimination. But
later, he told THE PITT NEWS
that he supported the action of
the Student Government when
it moved to do precisely what
he had declared was beyond its
proper jurisdiction. This very
same matter gave rise to con-
tradictory public and private
testimony from the Dean of
Students and his subordinates
as to the former discriminatory
practices of that office. It was,
asiMiss Dolinar wrote in the
above cited iiiblumn:

“An interesting situation which
often arises is that two differ-
ent admi'nistrators give two dif-
ferent stories on the_same situ-
ation. Later, the two ‘administra-
tors will get together and decide
on a single story. If they are
fortunate, their original state-
ment was ambiguous enough that
there is little difficulty in chang-
ing its meaning. Otherwise they
simply claim
said it, or that they were mis-
understood.” I
_ The students involved are al-
ways aware that untruthful acts
had been committed. Do these
actions benefit the search for
t.ruth, or do they stifle and re-
tard tliat search? \

Another example of recent in-
terest was the effort on the part
of a group of students to cur-
tail the great quantity of class-
room cheating which so openly
operates within the University.
This effort was received by the
administration-in a manner sim-
ilar to the reception which would
be given a proposal to decrease
administrative salaries. Some of
our executives urged patience,
others understanding. The bene-
ﬁciaries of such charitable atti-
tudes are those who win uni-
versity diplomas through thiev-
ery. Indeed, some ad"minis~trators
snickered at the cleverness of
the cheaters and others regard-
ed the group of leaders as offi-
ci ous individuals, meddling

where we ought not to have been

concerned. I assure you that had
administration attitudes prevail.-
ed, even‘ the flimsy product of
our labor which ﬁnally evolved
would have been discarded and
forgotten. If personal integrity
occupied its rightful primacy in
the University scale of values,

rconcerted administrative action
would be directed toward the

{minimization of unethical aca-
demié practices.

Again it was Assistant-
Chancellor Geise who set the
tone of the stiﬂers, and, in the
light of his personal conduct
with students ‘and faculty
members, it is not difﬁcultsto
ascertain why he would be "in-
different ‘ toward undergradu-
ate cheating, and unenthusi-
astic concerning schemes con-
trolling it. If I may again
quote Miss Dolinar:

“For almost four years, I have
watched this, situation grow
Worse, until now a student "can
almost be assured that any ideas
he wishes to, put into effect, any
hope to change existing condi-
tions, will be squelched through
one means or another.”

Or, as Chancellor Litchﬁeld

,-"said atthe noon Tap-Day cere-

,4

monyz. “The man. in, the grey
flannel suit i's the symb’ol_.of the
great institution, all of which
seek conformity. In these great
institutions it is difficult to ex-
ercise leadership.” '

It would be my assertion that
the greatest adverse relationship
between bureaucracy and admin-

’ istrative in_tegrit.y is its by-pro-

duct -- fear and secrecy. The

 University, as a whole has fran-

   

that they never.

’ To ’r|1eii End‘ of Reckoning

tically obscured, for example,
the true reason for the dismissal
of faculty, administrators, and
students. They have published
innocuous reasons for such dis-
missals, never disclosing or even
hinting at the sexual perversion,
ﬁnancial irregularity, and gen-
eral dishonesty of the individuals
involved, so that the offenders
simply removed to other institu-
tions wherein they are free to
continue their immoral and
loathsome habits. Is this service
to the cause of truth? to cleanse
your o_wn halls by distributing
the most intolerable of your
scum to defile the campus of
other institutions? I

"Some of you may recall the
‘silence which Dr. Geise at-
tempted to impose upon me
which Murray Chass described
in an editorial in THE PITT
,NEVVS. Never refuted, Chass
described how Geise attempt-
ed to cower me_ into suspending
my efforts to brand Nikita
Khruschev as a butcher and a
swine prior to his recent visit
to our campus. In the same re-
port, and in others, THE PITT
NEWS hasrelated how the
same ofﬁcial has attempted to
censor the editorial and news
columns of THE PITT NEWS,
always resisted by the cour-
ageous editors of that paper.
, Now’ it may be that you as a
student feel that you have been
unaware of much that has occur-
red around you. If this is the
case, you have not necessarily
been‘ unobservant. As R. P.
Oliver has written:

“Americans who now wonder
what has been happening in the
colleges are discovering that it
is no easy matter to ﬁnd out.
Nothing is to be learned from
the masterpieces of double ‘talk
that are written by public rela-

tions secretaries and read in pub- .

lic by the morearnbitious college
presidents when they feel the
urge to drum up more trade, to

put the squeeze on the alumni‘
or the legislature, or to get their

names in the newspapers. The
constant rattle of this prefabri-
cated oratory subdues the pro-
nouncements of the occasional
president who has something to
say and dares to say it. And there
are almost no other sources of
information, for what really‘ de-
feats the inquirer is the rigid
system of taboos that governs
the academic Polynesia. It is a
close world in which there is
much that should not be said
aloud —— certainly not within the
hearing of outsiders.

No, it is. only a few students
who are unfortunate or fortunate
enough ‘to observe these aca-
demic irresponsibilities. T a 1 k
with Murray Chass, Joanne Doli-
nar, Harriet Wehner, who have

— edited the Pitt News. Talk with

Bert O’Malley, Kent Jarrell, or
others experienced in Student
Government. Speak with David
Breakstone, John Strauch or
others’ who have had long and

"intimate experience in the Stu-
dent Affairsrarea. These people, '

like myself, have been close to a
variety of administrators and
faculty members and have per-

sonally observed what has train-,

spired. Bewildering at first, we
have soon learned that most of
the evil is hidden from_ the av-
erage student, and hidden well.
Information of this sort -sel.dom
appears in print and is generally

‘spoken only in whispers. We can

no longer aﬁord silence.

There is of course, an ex-
planation for the silence. It
is due to fear. Each bureau-
crat feds obliged to please his
superior. 1) this means, fre-
quently appearing to agree
with him, even when you do

not, and 2) keeping any prob-
lems which arise within your
jurisdiction ‘as quiet and un-
obtrusive as possible. If, in
the secondfcase, it _ happens
that silence will preclude solv-
ing the problem, that is no-
matter. In the same article,
Joanne Dolinar wrote:
“There seems to be a gener-
alized fear among administrators
that if they make one wrong

,move they will lose their jobs.

Perhaps they‘have ‘seen a few
too many administrators leave. in
the past few years. So one gets
the impression that what is be-
ing done by the administrators

. is not done for the students, but

to make the administrators look
good, to assure themselves that
they will keep their positions,
or even better, receive a promo-
tion.”

It is again instructive to re-
construct a typical situation to
illustrate the operation of- this
process. Dr. Geise is responsible
to the Chancellor. Since he is a
man of intelligence, he is afraid
of the Chancellor. In fact, he
goes to unbelievable and path-
etic extremes to demonstrate his
loyalty to and agreement with
the Chancellor —— his protesta-
tions of devotion approach those
ordinarily reserved for the Deity.
He is exceedingly anxious, on

this account, thatno sign of 

rest ‘orerror should cgme to the
attention of the Chancellor from

this area. It would be regarded ,

as even more serious if such
error or unrest would come to
the attention of the public. In
order to accomplish this he tends
to silence or eliminate legitimate
student concern, lest his super-
iors would regard him as less
competent. Bureaucracy thereby
begets fear, and secrecy is be-
gotten by fear.

As Litchﬁeld said» in his
noonday speech, “There «is a‘
need for a pluralistic ‘structure,
not a monolithic structure .. . .
The virtues of a pluralistic
structure must not be lost.”

The question of silence leads
me to my third and ﬁnal point,

' an area in which there has been

onlyselected. silence, but the sel-
ections have been. made with
care.

The trimester program was
implemented ina hasty manner,
with ' little or no consultation
with faculty members, whom it
will be recalled, the administra-
tion exists to serve. Those pro-

fessors who opposed the idea, or '

even urged more deliberation

- prior to its adoption, were not

only discouraged from such ob-
jections, but were"‘actually pun-
ished and subjected to veiled
threats. All those who did not
evidence complete faith in the
administration were dealt with
most severely. We hear loud

-pronouncements from some Uni-

versity oﬁicials about academic
freedom, but it seems a professor
who has the freedom to criticize
the federal government cannot
take issue with certain Univer-
sity “organization men.” / _
Once implemented, it would
be thought that the scheme
would be the object of’ studies
to ascertain the reaction of
students and faculty concern-
ing it. That this has not been
the case proves again, beyond
any doubt, that the adminis-
tration is not concerned with
the attitudes of students and
faculty: their concern‘--is ‘mak-
ing the ‘administration look
good, therefore the ‘trimester is
here to sta-y—-the devil with
the views of students and
teachers.”
Turner again quoted a part of
Miss Amdur’s column:
‘The interesting point to no-

 
 

 

ticc about the student’s reaction
to the trimester is that no one
with any_ authority has paid any

attention to what they have said, ,

nor has anyone granted any val-
idity to their complaints.”

In a conversation some weeks
ago with Dr. Geise, I mentioned
in response to an inquiry, that
some students objected to as-
pects of the trimester plan. It
was as if someone had raised a
complaint to Stalin about the
validity of Marxian economics.
He demanded to know to what
we objected.

I replied that indeed, the
term was only 12 or 13 weeks
long instead of the advertised
15, that there was not adequate
time for beneﬁcial review or
assimilation, and that it may
be undesirable for a studentin
the arts or humanities to study
throughout the year, thereby
missing the beneﬁts o°f assimi-
lation, reading, work, and
travel which once occurred in
the summer and which doubt-
less contributed to the broad
education of the student.

I was not dogmatic, but made

clear that some held these views ~

and that some of -them appeared
to be valid criticism of the pro-
gram and they should at least be
dealt with. "
, At this point, rather than deal-
ing rationally with my points,
Dr. Geise lounched an “ad hom-
inum” attack by suggesting in an
indignant rage, that I was "neither
old enough jn or experienced
enough to hold opinions on such
matters. (He did not advise me
at what age one becomes capa-
ble of thinking critically. It may
be, that. Dr. Geise, like Plato,
would await’ the age of _4-3 be-
fore making decisions of an im-
portant.~~natur_c,'_but it is more
likely that an undergraduate 60
years old would not be capable
of decision-making‘ in the ‘As-
sistant Chance1lor’s eyes., if such
an undergraduate were not a
fanatic disciple of the Litchﬁeld
program.) I ‘
I‘1'esponded that, indeed, I
was not overly experienced,
but men such as ‘President
Griswald, president of Yale
University, also had reserva-
tions, observing that Griswald
had declared that the “Tri-
mester will kill some of the
students; and deaden the rest.”
This response was a tactical
mistake on, my part, for ‘one

, does not quote presidents of

other institutions unless they

are advocates of the Litchfjeld

program reservation. '

“Do you mean,” Dr. Geise
said, “that you would .°adopt the
position of President Griswald
before you would support your
own Chancellor?”

I simply responded that the

Ivy League had not been totally,

discredited,- and the interview

terminated. Now my purpose in‘

relating this conversation has
been only to illustrate the unre-
alistic attitude, nay, astounding
attitude, held by the adminis-
tration _concerning faculty and
student opinion. The administra-
tion which exists to serve its
faculty and students does not
even’ regard its ‘students as ca-
pable of holding opinions, and,

as we have seen,’/is not inter-

ested in ‘the opinions of faculty
members save when those opin-
ions happen to reinforce the cur-‘
rent administrative dogma.

It iscimy belief that of the
University is actually inter-
ested in the truth_it will make
a legitimate effort to discover.
student attitudes , and faculty
opinions about these vital at-.
aiifs. It is the opinion of many
that it is impossible to educate '
a student as well under the
high speed (sweat it, then for‘-

     

 



get it)‘ system. Many would

hold with Miss Amdur that “it

is ﬁne to compete with Russia

for the production of.college

graduates, but when competi-

tion means the dehumanization

of education and the falsiﬁca-

tion of every respectable edu-

cational standard, then perhaps
we should examine our goals
more closely.” Indeed if we
are to approach intellectually
dishonest programs in a mo!‘-
ally dishonest fashion, one
might well inquire why we
should trouble ourselves to
compete with the Soviets’ if
we are going to adopt their—dis-
honest slogans, and Godless
standards in our own nation.

.P_aixet 5 C‘

It may be too much to expect
our grotesque, bureaucracy to
examine its goals. They have
put their eggs in the trimester
baskets, and it seems they are
determined to continue‘ w_ith ‘it,
even it‘ they are thereby obliged
to do injury to truth and its pur-
suit. Unless some re-evaluation
is made, surely time will prove:
l\/liss Amdur correct when she
wrote, “It will become -21 Tower
of Babel, an institution symbol-
izing intellectual incoherence and
mental slovenliness, and a haven

for those who wish to reach the ‘

truth in two and two-thirds
years.” '
And so, as we began these
thoughts with truth, so they
shall close. We have noted the
recent improvements in the Uni-
versity and given them praise.
_But we have been obligedito dis-
cuss‘ questions even prior to
thosein which strides have been
taken. I have cited the unhealthy
spectacle of the bureaucracy of
the academy and its" limitations
upon the search for truth. We
have recalled. together some of
the truly distressing aspects of
the mores of’administration', and
ﬁnally, using the trimester as a
case in point,‘have noted "how
the bureaucracy and‘ these ethi-
cal abberations have combined to
stifle investigation and criticism

of the conditions of education, by.

the people, students‘ and faculty,
whohave the most primary con-
cern with those conditions.‘

i It has been an impressive V
task! I have come to’ love this
University and he‘ people. It s
has been good to me inthe
last four years, as have her
students and professors. Itlis

that affection that obliges me

to raise these basic questions
which have been suggested
today. ‘ L

Dr. ?LitChﬁe1d also said today
in his noon address that “heiis
surely no leader who parrots the

wsrds and troughts of others_.”"

It is therefore the obligation of”
the leader to risk condemnation

.in presenting the truth.

The University cannot avoid‘
the search for truth. If, by its
precepts or conduct, or by the
precepts or conduct‘ of its
agents and officers, itsfails to
point the way to a better un-
derstanding of truth, it cannot
become a great institution‘.
Neither la-rge enrollments, nor
beautiful grounds and struc-
tures, nor a faculty of distinc.
tion, nor a well paid and ex-
alted administration measure
the worth of a university. '

Edward Alvey wrote! “Does

not the greatness of a university ‘

lié in the impression it makes on
the minds and character of those
who come under its inﬂuence?

T Weighed in the balance with

other yalues of life, personal in-
tegrity and honor are properly
assayed as the most precious ele-

‘ments in the education of -man.”
The University must. seek the ‘

truth, it must exemplify the
truth. It can ignore the truth,
but only at its ‘peril. “Truth,”
wrote Shakespeare, “is truth, to
the end « of ' reckoning.”

After two days of hectic wrestling and 181 individual
wrestling bouts were completed, Lehigh University came

, away with the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Champion-

ship and the most valuable wrestler award, while the Lehigh
fans came in ﬁrst in the country for unsports'man1i,k.e con-

duct.

Rex Pcer_v's Panthers followed
Lehigh in team point production,
24 markers in arrears. Lehigh and
Penn State each had three indivi-
dual champions, while the Pan-
thers had two. Navy was the only
other team to register a champ.
Thad Turner won the It'll;/W
award. .

But. Lehigh rooters stole the
show from the wrestlers, while
cheering their team home to vic-
tory. The partisan spectators went
out of their way to boo Pitt and
Penn State every chance they had.
and every time a Lehigh wrestler
stepped onto the mat the fans
would immediately await
chance to start shouting abuse on
Lehigh’s opponent.

Rough at Times

One time, one wrestler wastin-

jured during a match with Lehigh

and the fans started to boo and;

rnake fun of the injured wrestler.
Even the press box got rough at
times.

A member of the press from
Pittsburgh was physically as-
sulted when he started to root
against Lehigh.

Lehigh’s overall team balance
was too much for Peery’s grapplers.
Lehigh placed their entire team
in the quarter-finals and had sev-
en wrestlers going into the semi-
ﬁnals. The Panthers losf one
wrestler (Bill Robb at 191) in the
opening round and three more in
the quarter—ﬁnals.

Second Place

Dick Martin and Larry Lauchle
each had won titles for the Pan-
thers with Daryl Kelvington and
Jim Harrison capturiiig second
place laurels.

John Zolikoff took a third
place and heavyweight Bob Gu-
zik captured a fourth.

Martin and Lauchle, seeded first
in their division, had little trouble
in winning the 123 and 130 pound
classes respectively. Martin regis-
tered two pins, one at 6:24" and the
other at 4:15. The latter was over
Bill Merrian of Lehigh. Martin
also scored a 9-2 win in the semi-
ﬁnals and a 8-0 victory in the
ﬁnals.

with 6-1 and 4-} scores. Kelving-

Johnston scored his point on a
predicament in the third period.
Harrison also lost out in the
ﬁnals. Pendleton of Lchigh
scored a 3-0 decision over [lar-
rison, much to the delight of the
Lehigh fans.

The only upset suf‘fercd by the
Panthers was at 147, when Bill

an overtime bout. '

Zolikoff was holding a 4-1 edge
going into the third and ﬁnal pe-

.Vamos Scores Only Point

By MARSHALL ‘ROIVIEO

Injury, sickness and disap-
pointment was the story as
the Panther thinclads trav-
eled to the IC4A Indoor
Championships in New York
last Saturday.

Sickness to Vance Carter and
Reed Clarke, both excellent mid-
dle distance men, cost the mile
relay and 1000 yd. run. Coach
Carl Rees men could only gain
one point in the afternoon and

evening sessions staged at the
mammoth Madison Square Gar-
den.

Ed Vamos placed in the broad
jump, but on a preliminary jump
his spikes caught. in the bottom
of a shallow jumping pit and he
pulled a leg muscle. Varnos didn’t
compete after that although he
qualiﬁed for the ﬁnals.

His previous jump of 23‘-’*5'ii”

was good enough f or th e ﬁf th
place. »
Ste ve Munter, one of Bees‘

most versatile runners also pull-

ed a muscle in the 60 yd dash.

Gym Coaches
Vote, Biggest
Step in Years

By JACK SMITH
E.r¢.-cutive Sports Editor

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIQIIIICIIIIJI
-vlonvnvvuzvunnllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

 

While the Panther gymnastic -team was participating in the East-
ern Championships last week at Annapol.is, the annual Eastern Inter-
collegiate Gymnastic League coaches meeting was held. The decisions
that were made ..at the conference could play an important role in
thc.United State’s picture in world gymnastics.

In"the past, the Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastic League, which
consists of'Ar'my, Navy, Temple, Syracuse, Penn State and Pitt, had
clung to the old program in gymnastics which included the rope
climb, tumbling, ﬂying rings, side horse, plus parallel and horizontal
bar events. This program was followed diligently despite the fact
that several of the events were not in Olympic competition, nor part
of the college program in other sections of theicountry, specifically
the Big Ten.‘ _ '

Changes by the coaches in the past were few. "Under thei?‘by—laws,
a unanimous vote was needed before a change could tﬁ place.

Last week Temple's coach'Carl Patterson and Panther coach
Warren Neiger introduced an amendment before the coaches which
called for a majority vote requirement on all rule changes. The
amendment was passed’ without difficulty.

That was the first and perhaps the most important step the coaches
took at their meeting, for immediately a motion véias introduced to
bring the still ringsapd free exercise events into the present program.

Syracuse.’s coach Paul Romeo and Army’s.coach Tom lV_Ialoney,,
who coached the Olympic gymnastic team last year, said they would
veto. the proposal and would not yield unless the coaches made the
‘program just the six Olympic events; the ‘long horse, side horse, still
rings, free exercise and parallel and horizontal bar events. The vote
was taken and Chet Phillips, Navy’s coach and chairman of the meeting

How will their deeisionaffect Pitt? “It will be a big help to
us,” said coach Neiger. “We have felt fora long time that the rope
climb was not an artistic event. Only Army and Navy have had
any luck interesting or training personal for the rope climb. I
hate to see the ﬂying ringsand tumbling events being eliminated,
but since they were not Olympic events, I agreed with the decision.”

Neigeri has twice National and Eastern Champion Tom Darling,
"57-’58,.to his coaching credit.

The use of just the Olympic event will also help Pitt on the
national level. For several years the Big Ten has pointed a ﬁnger
of scorn at Eastern Gymnastic teams who have failed to follow a
p1=ogr=ana_ similar to the Olympics. Since the two areas now have
gymnastic events in common, there is a possibility of competition on
a national level. ’

As for the Olympics, the Eastern section of the country can now

train athletes for the events that will help bring the United States A

higher than ﬁfth place in world gymnastics. It will also bring Amer-
igran gymnasts a little closer to Japan and Russia who finished one-
two in the Olympics last year.

Only» the approval of the Athletic Directors of the six Eastern
colleges is need for the ruling to go into effect. The coaches are
pushing for a decision by April 1. When the ruling comes, I feel
that the Athletic Director’s vote will also be unanimous.

Weather permitting, Coach
John Michelosen and his staff
will greet more than 70 grid-
ders this afternoon as the Pan-

thers begin spring football

practice. If Michelosen can’t

begin work ‘today, he hopes to
start as soon as there is a break
in the weather.

Michelosen will have 18 letter-
men plus one of the finest fresh-
men teams in University history
to work with. 3

The coaches will have a special
eye trained on the ends and
tackles. All four starters at these

positions from last year’s, team-

are gone. The Cats will also lack
depth at fullback and quarter-

bacl<.. There is only one letter-
man returning at each position.
The team is well ﬁxed for
guards, centers and halfbacks.
There are ﬁve lettermen re- *
turning at guard. two at ‘center
and four at halfback.

“Most of our early work will
be on blocking and tackling," said
Michelosen in regard_ to the prac-
tice agenda.

Under NCAA rules. Michelosen
has only 20 days to look over the
prospects to get an idea of the
material he will have next fall.

The Panthers’ shallow quar-
terback situation may not be as
bad as the coaches claim. Al-_
though Ed Sharockman drop-

Krause sacriﬁced a year of eli-

Hugh Peery. Tops Grapplers

By ED HOVVARD

Long before Panther wrestling coach Rex Peery ever
thought of coming east, he was pinning opponents for his
alma mater, Oklahoma A. & M. As a matter of fact, he piled
up three national championships while grappling for the

A ggies.

But when the Universit_v’s wrestling team was preparing
for the 1954 campaign, Rex \7vas9‘“~“*"*'~“"i‘~*“*"'-~-—*-~*--

coaching. There was a Peery
wrestling, but his_name was Hugh.

Hugh was a senior, and he had
amassed an impressive record
himself during the two previous
seasons. After losing a decision
to Penn State’s Bob Homan dur-
ing his sophomore year, the 123-
pound matman proceeded‘ to ring
up 31 victories against the lone
defeat. In the process he garnered
two‘ NCAA championships, both
in the 1.15-pound class.
' Proud Father

Did the coach’s son get any
preferential treatment? “Of course
not,” says the elder Peery. ‘If
anything, I made things rougher
on my boy than on the others’.
But that didn’t stop me from be-
ing proud of him. One of the
proudest .-moments in my life

came when Hugh was selected for

the 1952 Olympic team.”

Hugh”s last year was a ﬁtting-
climax to a brilliant collegiate
wrestling career. He led his
teammates through a tough
schedule, scoring victories over
top teams such as Michigan
State, Army.,Navy, and Lehigh.
Their only loss was a 16-11

Navy, and they had won the
NCAA title the year before. Hugh,
wrestling against the same Bob
Hom-an who, as a sophomore, had
handed him his only defeat, led
the P;.zntheI's to the team trophy.

Two weeks later, l7cery headed

The team trophy went to Rex

his third‘ national title--ironical-
