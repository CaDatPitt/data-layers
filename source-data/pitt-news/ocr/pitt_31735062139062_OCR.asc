The Junior “Prom” committee is

-rmaking rapid progress in completing
‘arrangements for the event. A letter

was received during the past week
from Mrs. John K. Tener, wife of
the GOvernor,. stating that she would
be a patroness. A canvas -is being
made of the faculty, a large number
of whom have‘ c-onsented to be pres-
ent at the “Prom-” and to have their
wives act as patronesses. \
Interest is very strong among the
students and indications point to a
large, attendance. In -this issue of
THE PITT WEEKLY will be found
a schedule of dances for the “Prom,”

which will aid the students in mak-

ing out their list of dances in ad-

HON‘ORj~sYsTEM OF ALL
STUDENT ACTIVITIES .
AT PITT IS URGED

The honor system as applied in
other universities has a wide scope,
covering not merel-y examinaiti-o_ns,

but every branch of student govern-

ment. The student senate controls
the conduct of the students’ in the
class room, and the professor in
charge holds the senate responsible
for any misconduct. _

Students are put on their honor in
using the University equipment and

the senateacts on all cases regarding A

the defacing of property. This honor
system has been adopted in most uni-
versities and is a much discussed
topic at Pitt at present. ‘

when interviewed ‘Wednesday even-
ing, was optimistic over the outlook
and claimed that he thought that
there would be ‘no trouble in getting
the remainder of the needed amount

"before the time that has been set for

the report of the Owl board. _Mr.
Helt said in part?

, “The outlook at the present time is..

very’ encoura.ging to the members of
the Owl board. We have all but $400
of the needed amount at present,
andeit seems to me that there will be

a no trouble in getting the rest of the

money together by the first of next
week.” _

THE JUNIOR PROM

Only a short time remains betorc
the annual dance of -the junior class
of the University: ' In this issue of
THE PITT WEEKLY appears a
schedule of the dances and the music
for that great event. Students will
be able to start at once ﬁlling up their
programs. ' It is the duty -of every
student that is able to go’ to the
“prom” to do so. The members‘ of
the committee have worked to make
the evening one of the most enjoyable
that has ever b-een arranged. and the‘
deserve the support of every man. at

The junior “prom” is a student ac-

tivity and like every. other student

activity it depends for its success on
the support of the students. Let
every one turn out an-d make the
1913 “prom” the best ever held in the
history of the University. ,,

OUR -TEAM

What is’ the matter with our basket
ball team? 'Nothing that we can see

1 They have lost only two games this

season and one of those they lost after
they had been playing every night for
a weekistraight and were not in-their
best physical condition by any means
Never in thehistory of the Univer-
sity has any basket ball team~inade
such ‘a wonderful trip as’,the one that
the 1913 varsity team made last week
And every student should be justly
proud of the great record that thr
team has made this year.

The great strength of the team lies
in the fact that theyplay as a team"
in every play, There are no individual
stars on the squad «that-want to‘ be
the whole show. .EVery man ‘is play-
ing for the team all the time and that

is why the success of the men has

been so marked. a , ,
One of the men ‘of the squad dis-
played‘ the spirit that has made the

team a great winner the other after-'

noon. He had been called on>for 9
speech in one ofthe classes and had
been introduced as the star of the
team. He replied that he was not the
star of "the team and that there were
no indiividual stars onthe team. He
claimed that every man was in the
game for the good of-“the squad and
for the sake of the University. and not
to make any special record for him-
self. ‘ '

Whife the Owl fund“ has takenTa
great jump during the past week: hav-
ing‘_gone up from $250 to'$6.l0. there
is st.ill_a considerable amount to be
raised by next Tuesday, afternoon
According to the plan‘ that has been
agreedgupon by the members of the
Owl board there must be $1,000 "on
hands—njot in promises but in cash-
when the Ad-visory Board meets next
week. There is, therefore, still .3390
to be gathered together in the few

days that remain before the time limit '9

expires. , No stu-dent.need be told how
vital it .is~for thewboard to havepthis
money at the appointed time. Every
man that has not yet,_given his sup-
-port, to this fund should see that he
sends his money to Manager Helt
before Tuesday afternoon in order
that the Owl board’ may report that
the‘ needed sum has been raised and
that there will be an Owl this year
at the University of Pittsburgh. am"
not only will there be ‘an Owl, but this
Owl will be able To pay for itself.

Editor The Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir: ' L _

It seems to me that some action
should -be taken to put a stop -to the
disturbancewhicli occurs daily in the
basement of State Hall during. the
noon hour. I imagine that this trouble
could be ‘easily rectified if the proper’
authorities would take an interest in
the matter. We have a Student Sen-
ate and I believe this body to be the
one to stop this noise.

Do you think that it is of any ad-
vantage to allow this?, Suppose that
a stranger were toihear it, would he
believe ours to be THE University?

I do hope something can be done,

Dear Sir: ,

know just how much_ of this report
is true but think «that ifit be true, it
is the most unprecedented outrage
that was evei‘ attemptedin the Uni-

‘ What right has the Pan-Hellenic
Club or any other su-ch organization
to demand that a student come before
them for trial?
they should have the brass to meddle»
in the affairs of an outsider? Where
did they. rece-ive the au-thority to set-
wtle any sort of cases,.inﬂ‘ict any pen-
alties or make any demands of under-
graduates outside of their organiza-
tion? They have no more right to
,make such demands than the ‘Pitt-
Wilkinsburg Club and any such de-
mand deserves nothing more than
hooits from the recipient. _ i
From what I hear they are organ-
ized, to promote fraternal interests in
the University, but from their actions
I judge that they have formed their
club to regulate student activities.‘ se-

‘The «club has been organized since
last fall and seems to be -composed of-
fellows from other institutions who
know little or nothing of affairs at

that the members of the Pan Hellenic

Announces %Football Schedule

Schedule for 1913 Is Hardest Ever
Arranged‘ for Gold and Blue Foot-
ball Team'—'-Game With Navy Ap-
pears Early on Card—-Cornell Will
Be Played at Ithaca — Lafayette
Game Looks Good. '

The schedule announced by Grad-
uate Manager Karl E. Davis isabout
the hardest list of games that a Pitt
team has ever had to play. All of
the hard games of last year’s card
remain with the exception of the
Notre Dame game and in addition to
these games with Lafayette. Cornell
and West Virginia University ‘have
been.arran.ged. .

The first game of the season will
be played with Ohio Northern on
September 27 at Forbes Field or D.
C. & A. C. Park and in this game

the Pitt warriorswill get their trial

for the game with the Navy on the
following Saturday at Annapolis. Pitt
has met the Midshipmen but once and
the game resulted in a defeat for Pitt
by a scorepof 13-6. The game was
close and clean, however, and will
arouse even more interest 'Cl‘1'lS’ year.
This big game. at such an early_-.'l_ate
will necessitate rigorous training
methods for the football coach, as it
is one of the most important eon-
tests on the schedule and a victory
would mean much to Pittsburgh’.

West Virginia will be met in Pitts-
burgh -on October 11 and will no
doubt give the eleven a hard battle.
They‘ have not appeared on the Pitt
schedules of the past two years and
Pitt football followers will be pleased
to see a familiar name on the new
card. In the last game played with
this institution, Pittsburgh won out,
35-0. '

The Carlisle ‘Indians will appear at
Forbes Field on Saturday, October
18, and the Gold and Blue eleven will
face one of the hardest games of the
season. Pitt has won bu-t a single
contestfrom the Indians and that
was in 1909, when Homer Roe’s team“
defgated the "Redskins by a score of
l - .

On the Saturday following ‘this
game the squad will‘ journey to
Ithaca _where Cornell will be played.‘
Pitt; has played several close games
with Cornelh but have always lost by
a small margin. 'I‘his game was-not

,on last year’s schedule, -but Pitt met.

Lafayette College Will Send Track
Team to Pittsburgh on May 3rd_—
Dual Meet Looks Good to.Track
Followers — Candidates_Working
Hard. _ , .

A dual meet with Lafayette College

is the latest addition to theitrack‘

schedule for the eoming season and
it helps to round out a hard card for
Pi=tt’s track aspirants. ‘The meet. will
be held at Trees Stadium on Satur-
day, May 3rd, and will include a full

schedule of traek_-and ﬁeld eveiits.‘

EVENT TO-NIGI-IT.i

While this date is a little earlier than
the management wished, it was the
only date that was ‘ open on both
schedules and rather than lose the
contest both managers decided "to
sign up a contract." '

Lafayette usually turns out strong
‘teams in all departments and are par-
!ticularly strong in track, so the dual
meet with Pittsburgh should prove of
great interest to local track follow-
ers.
‘both football and track ‘ cards, as
Graduate Manager Karl E. Davis has
a football-game arranged with them
for November 8th, in Pittsburgh. It
is hoped that this institution will be
in close athletic relation with Pitts-
burgh in the near future.

cinder path experts are working out

Coach Proven and Manager Down-

‘to ﬁll the date ‘recently cancelled by‘

New Bethlehem High School. The
withdrawal of this date comes as a
blow to the Freshman management

as the guarantee oﬁered for t'he game

was expected .to help offset the ex-!-

‘penses of the ﬁve on a two—game tr.ip.[

DuBois High School is one of the
teams to be metion the trip and they
will be a hard nut for the ’16 ﬁve to
crack, as DuBois recently defeated
Bellefonte Academy by a large score.
While Coach H. H. Proven was dis-
appointed «by the recent defeat of his
boys at Columbiana, he feels that tl.e
foreign floor was largely responsible
for the loss of the game.

of the time and when Weavei‘ tied the
‘score with ’a foul goal in the last sec-
ond of play, the cheering became a
bedlam of noise. -

. When the extra period of
started, Reese caged a ﬁeld goal. right
oft’ the bat and his score. which would
have won the game, was followed, up
by field goals, from the hands of
Baker and Frishman. Pitt showed
superior passing and shooting, but
‘the Swarthmore team put up a clean,
fast game, which will long be remem-
bered by those who saw the contest.
They are a very heavy aggregation
zind when Frishman stacked: up

against a guard who -tipped the scales

at over 200 the comparison was ludi-
ierous. It may be stated, however,
that Frish put up a great exhibition
-of basket ball and won plaudits from
the crowd. ‘ '

The team stayed at the dormitories
and were greatly pleased with the
courteous treatment. accorded them
by the Swarthmore undergrads. It is
