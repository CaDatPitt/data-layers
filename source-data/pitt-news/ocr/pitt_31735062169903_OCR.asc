‘Comrnuter’
Elections

In Turmoil  

Results of elections’ held dur-

mass turmoil, are presently unde-
cided.

After recognition of 50 new

members. a president and vice--

president were elected. This ac-
tion_ occurred after the card-hold-
ing members had walked out of
the meeting. I '

Before". the 50 new members a.r- ‘

A ‘rived at the meeting. elections"

were held by the members of -the
Commuter Council. This election
was later found to be void when

-«it was noted that the Constitution .
stated that nominations must be '
. made not less than one and not-..:

more ‘than three weeks before,
elections are held. This part of

-the'constitution- was one. of the

parts that was amendedby the

newly recognized members of the
' Commuter Council.  

A second ‘motion, which passed

unanimously, by the new mem- _
-bers-was that parliamentary pro-
cedure would be utilized by the

Commuter Association during" the
meetings. The only clear cut stip-
ulations'”of the present ~constitu-.'

tion are that the Commuter Coun- ’

lieved the bill to be "pointless.
and regressive as opposed to pro- .

gressive." Stark further indicated

that he felt it. would bedangerous;

with the necessary two-thirds vote
of approval. r I '

The Senate next considered and
approved a proposal to cancel

‘Pitt News’ Profile

-« .-La»-

By JIM MARGITAN
Staff Feature Writer

If the students want more lib-
eral administrators, they should
try to get more men of the type
of Dr. David Halliday. dean of
the Faculty of the Arts and Sci-
ences. When interviewed as to
his opinion on campus issues. he
showed himself to hold more lib-
eral viewpoints than many, stu-
dents.

A strong supporter of Student
Power, he favors it because “It's
a constructive working together.

  
 
 
  
 
 
    

say that I am completely and
thoroughly opposed to the war in
Vietnam——I took part in the march
on the Pentagon. which is some-
thing most college administra-
tors didn‘t do. I remember an-
other war. however. in which a
man named Hitler murdered six
million people. and for this rea-
son I realize that force is it nec-
essary factor in the world and I
recognize the need for a military
establishment. I do not agree with
the present ROTC program and
I hope to see it revised so that it
can be accredited

to some de—'

ship. Although I can't find any-
thing of great literary merit in
Alternatives, the danger of cen-
sorhip far outweighs the danger
of permissiveness in this area. I
don't think that Alternatives is
harming anyone’s morals on this
campus. Personally I find the
Black Action Society News much
more interesting.

Not content to just stand by and
watch. the English-born adminis-
trator has urged ‘the various de-
partments to involve students. "I
am pleased by the departments‘

Pitt Theatre ‘Rolls’  Andffhe 

 

In Disorgcmiz ation

by TOM MILLER
Staff Feature Writer

Whatever the Pitt Theatre lacks
in professional polish and skill.
it more than adequately makes up
for in typically theatrical dis-
organization. irrational oblivion to
schedules. and general confus-
l0ll.

Nightly. and probably more
often as the opening of the lat-
est production approaches. the
assortment of Biology majors.
stagestruck actors, and uninhibit-
ed exhibitions that call them-
selves the University of Pitts-
burgh Theatre meet to work on
this term’s production of “The
Caucasian Chalk Circle."

The other night, however, no
one was on stage at'the Stephen
Foster Memorial. In fact, ex-
cept for the four or five beard-
ed ones slouching in and around
the faded red seats of the audi
torium and blowing smoke about
the old days in the theatre, there
were very few people even near
the stage.

One person ’ began rummaging
theough the remnants of the last
few productions. The person turn-
ed out to be Richard Evans. tech-
nical director of the theatre. who
has just recently come to Pitt from
the Asolo Theatre. the state
theatre of Florida. After his work
on productions of “The Visit" and
“The Alchemist." Mr. Evans is

a valuable acquisition to the Pitt ‘

Theatre. He continued to rum-
mage.

In the -basement of Stephen Fos-
ter. Dr. Leyland Starnes was re-
hearsing part of the cast. Sever-
al children. painfully neces-
sary to the play, were running
about forgetting lines and entran-
ces. but no one seemed to mind.
As no one was yet banging his
head against a wall, and as no one
was lying prostrate on the floor.
one could only assume that every-
thing was on schedule. At least
no one was admitting it wasn't.

While this test of nerves was
being_ conducted in the base-

ment, a group of stage hands were

Dr. Benjamin Spock, noted

room Monday at noon.

He is speaking nationwide on

either to the shops for more
scenery, or to a figure of authority
to seek permission for some in-
genious inovation for Pitt
Theatre.

One or two of the less harried
individuals stopped to talk about
the distinctions of this production
of Bertolt Brecht’s play of Epic
Theatre. The multi-media idea is
one of which they were parti-
cularly proud. During the action
on stage. film will be projected
onto the background of the stage.
This is consistent with Brecht‘s
desire to incorporate as many
elements of staging as possible in
order to force up a barrier be-
tween the audience and the play
on the stage. Brecht wanted a
distancing effect. and the Pitt
Theatre hopes that the film se-
quences will help to produce
that idea.

Just that day. however, it was
discovered that the hundreds of
feet of film that had been shot the
previous weekend somewhere in
the wilds of .a Youngstown. Ohio
park had been exposed and ruined.
“We‘ll get some more footage
next weekend and shoot some
interiors around here.” someone
said weakly, trying to convice

“Marat-Sade,” so the Pitt group
has had experience in the area.

There were _people getting busy
throughout Setphen Foster and
the basement of the Cathedral. In
the costume shops several ladies
sat at tables sewing apparel for
the show. Lights from the un-
finished Basement Theatre went
out‘ on the shoulders of some
workmen headed for stephen

Many of’ the ‘people at Steph-

happening. A few did. and the

_play will probably be in good

shape because of them. Out of the
confusion. mangled

and temporary setbacks will prob-
ably rise a finished play.

And it came to pass that one
fine morning in the year of our
Lord 1969 Sir Robert the Right-
eous of Fleming was galloping
merrily across the lea of the Duchy
of Penna on his mighty white
steed, Caplan. As he approached
the fair city of Pitts. he heard
shrill shrieks coming from the
mighty stone cathedral that tower-
ed over the city like a giant
phallic symbol. “What ho, Caplan.
me thinks there’s trouble about. I
must needs investigate the situa-
tion.”

SO, OFF HE set efstoons in
search of a quest to increase his
knightly prowess. “Won’t King
Raymond of the Round Table
be pleased when he learns of my
high and noble deeds,” thought
Sir Robert as be polished his
portable spitoon. As he came clos-
er to the Cathedral he saw a
maiden leaning out of the 36th
floor.

mer Sessions will offer a new op-
portunity to students in the Col-

haps only tangentially related to
his major. without disrupting prog-
ress toward his degree.

For example. such areas of con- .

centrated study will be Contem-
porary Society and Culture. So-
cial Dynamics., Communica-
tions. Asian Civilization. Euro-
pean Cultures. Medieval Liter-
ature and Culture. Administra-
tion. Black Culture. Contemporary
American Culture, and European
Civilizations.

A student wishing to study

Grapplers Hope For ‘Little Extra’;

By MARTHA HARTLE
Assistant Sports Editor

It usually takes a little extra to beat Penn State — in any
sport. And according to wrestling mentor Dave Adams, the mat-
men hope to “pull out a little extra” tomorrow night when they
renew an old rivalry_with their Pennsylvania cousins.

"We’ve been trying to get the
boys ready.” commented Adams.
“Each guy has a job to do. It’ll
be the same old story that it‘s
been all season long — we'll have
to win about six and keep from
getting pinned. I’m anticipating
a lot of close bouts and -it could
be a very close meet."

he commented. “They barely lost
to Navy (18-14) and whipped Le-
high, (22-12) in their last two
matches.” (Navy drubbed the
matmen 27-8, while Lehigh is on
tap next week.)

“State has fair overall balance.
better than ours.” Adams con-
tinued; “And they’re very strong
up through 160.“

Despite the loss of the four
Eastern champs. the Penn State
line-up is still bolstered by sev-
eral outstanding individuals. Den-
nis Keefe. a national junior col-
lege champion who was injured
throughout most of the season. is
back in the line-up at 137.

Since coming off the injury list,
he has gone undefeated and
coach Adams’ predicts that Keefe
will give the varsity’s.Pat Lav-
ery (7-1) one of his stiffest tests
of the year. The coaches have
rated Keefe ahead of Franklin
and Marshall’s Jake Homiak,
last year’s Eastern runner-up at
137.

Sophomore Clyde Frantz is rat-

-ed as one of the best‘ sophomores

in the East and he‘ currently
stands 4-2 on the season for Penn
State. His only defeats were a
one-point decision to Maryland's
All-American Gobel Kline and a
decision -to Army’s Mark Hoff-
man. ‘ -

Frantz

may be going at 145 against,Mark
Payne tomorrow. Payne. who
along with teammate Ralph Cin-
drich, was named to honorable
mention on‘ the mid-season All
American team. is gunning for his
sixth straight win. Cindrich is
undefeated at heavyweight and
looking for his seventh straight.

If Frantz goes at 145, State will
use Don ‘Stone, normally a 145

_pounder, at 152 against Buddy

Morris. .“Morris started very
slowly this year,” explained
Adams, “but he’s beenimprov-
ing and he should have a good
chance against Stone.”. '

Tankmen Finish Dismal Year
Travel To Kent State Today

by MARTIN HELLMAN

This afternoon, the swim-
ming team travels to Kent
State University to face the
Golden Flashes in the final dual
meet of the season.

It seems unlikely that the mer-
men will be able to finish the
year on a winning note. Kent
State has only lost two meets this
season, both of them against intr-
state rivals Ohio U. and Cincin-

nati U. The tankmen have fared"
rather poorly so far, winning only
two of nine meets.

The Golden Flashes strength is
easily seen in their scores against
common opponents; They lost to
Ohio U. by a margin of only 10
points, while the tankmen were
clobbered by the same school, 81-
32. Kent State Whipped Grove
City. 77-35, while the mermen
dropped their last meet to the
Grovers, 64-49.

Gymnasts at Syracuse

by MIKE WALDHOLZ
Hoping to end a dismal season with a climatic win, the
gymnasts are headed for Syracuse and a meet there tomorrow.
Their present record is one win and eight losses, but their East-
ern League record is the same as Syracu-se’s 0-6.

Both teams are tied for last place in the league. with Penn State
in first place with a 7-0 record followed closely by second place Tem-

ple at 6-1.

Explaining the nature of this
meet coach Warren Neiger stated.
“It’s going to be some meet.
Many people are looking forward
to this meet; it's sort of the ‘bat-
tle of champions, in reverse.”

Nieger continued, “The boys
have a very good attitude about
this meet and would really like to
put it away. If we can go to Syra-
cause without anjuries then
I feel we should take it.”
As of now the team's regualr six
gymnasts are in good shape.

Besides sporting asnpoor a sea-
son as the gymnasts. Syracuse is
having a serious depth problem.
From reports Neiger has received
on Syracuse it seems that they are

The gymnasts meanwhile, are
smelling for the first time since
Slippery Rock and are going to

Coach Bill Grant faces the same
problem in this meet that he has
encountered all season. “Kent
State has a lot of good freestylers
and they can use them to the best
advantage against us becuase we
are limited in those events,” he
commented.

Throughout the year, Grant
has relied heavily on just four
outstanding swimmers and one di-
ver. Dave Wessel’s performances
in the one and three meter dives.
Howard Norris and Richard Nor-
ris. Gene Hoffman and Joe Hayes
have accounted for the great ma-
jority of the squad’s points.

Besides the varsity meet, the
freshmen will battle the Kent
State frosh. This will be the sec-
ond collegiate contest for the
frosh, who earlier in the year
downed Penn State. I

The freshman meet should be
very exciting becasue the Pitt
frosh have done exceptionally
well in exhibition races and ac-
cording to Grant, “The Kent State
freshmen are always strong.”

Tomorrow afternoon, the varsi-
ty will compete against the fresh-
men in an exhibition meet at
Trees Pool at 2 p.m. Although the
frosh will give up [6 points in the
diving events because of no en-
trants, both Grant and frosh coach
Jerry Snyder expect a close con-
test.

Await IC4A’s

Thinclads Repay V isit
, by ED CONLEY
A few weeks ago the Delaware track squad visited the Field
House to battle the competition in the first Pitt Track Classic.
Tomorrow it will be Jim Banner’s turn to take his thinclads t
that school for the Delaware Invitation. I -

The coach is hoping that the visit will not be similar to the one
the opposition experienced. Delaware. unofficially. finished last in the

Classic.

‘There were no official team
scores in the previous meet and
the same will be ture of tomor-
encounter. This is something that
pleases Banner.

“This is why I enjoy this one,”
he said. _“It will help the boys
get ready for the IC4A’s. With no
team scores we’ll see what they
can do.”

The IC4A’s are scheduled for
next week.‘ but Banner still does-
n’t know who will be entered in
the meet. Tomorrows events will
be important in the making of the
final decisions. The decisions will
be a bit more difficult than ex-
pected, too. Injuries have placed
question marks on the status of
two thinclads who were practical-
ly in the competition already.

In fact. leg Injuries may pre-
vent Jerry Richey and Smitty
Brown from running in Delaware.

“We took X-rays and there was

nothing, Banner mentioned.
“They’re still a little tender,
though. They've been working out.
We'll take them along and we’ll
see if they can go.”

Bryant Salter. who will prob-
ably go to the IC4A's, and the
varsity relay teams could find to-
morrow’s action important. es-
pecially the relay squads. Banner
hasn’t come close to deciding
where these teams will be next
week.

Another group of relay runners
will be in Delaware. but they
won't have any special race to
look forward to. The freshman
one—mile quartet of Dorel Wat-
ley. Dennis Schatzman, Ken Bal-
key. and Tom Whittaker will run
against other frosh in their first
outing in two weeks.

“We’ll try them and see how

they do,” Banner decided. “The _ I

time off hasn’t hurt them, they’ve
been working out.
