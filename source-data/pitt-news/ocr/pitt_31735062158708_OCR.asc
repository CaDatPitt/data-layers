.- I’-resident, Student Faculty '
Association.

» When campus big-wigs gath-
er, _and subject matter is lack-
ing, student ' government can
always be used for the butt of a
few pointed wisecraclcs. The
inevitable question eventually
drifts to the surface: “VVhat
has SFA done?” And the an-
swer’ is ever vague and ephem-
eral. ‘

U nquestionably, the machina-
tions of our ’legislative organ
are not of such moment that they
stir the minds" of constituents to
the heat of extreme approval or
protest. But let us go a bit further
into the depths of debate, and
place before us this-proposition:
“What can any student govern-
ment do?” .

At its best, student government
is an honorary recognition of the
popularity of ’a given group of
students, and at times even that i.s
rather empty.

In the spring, our legislators
are inﬂated by the fever interest
aroused by budding politicos;
when September rolls around, they
find that they, too, just work here.
Interest in their actions is-now
confined to a small group of re-
formers, job—seekers, editors,
critics, plain chronic gripers, and
the office—holders_: themselves.

Survey Conducted

Minnesota’s student legislators
recently conducted an extensive
survey on the subject of college
student government. They found
that a strong student government
could hold approximately 12 pow-
ers, most of which are at present
exercised by our: Pitt Assembly-
men.

Some of these would probably
not be accepted by the Pitt stu-
dent, body, as, for instance, one
covering the power
and the administration of all ac-
tivities funds. Control of frater-
nity-sorority policiesiwould cer-
tainly not be desirable to a ma-
jority of campus voters.

And yet, it appears to be true
that on most of the major cam-
puses in the country, although
they complain that it does little,
the students would" still be unwill-
ing to delegate too much power to
their student government lest per-
sonal liberties be usurped.

Check The Records

'Stu_d,ent government, like the
human bodyitself, is not immune
to disease. Lack of interest, insuf-
ficient time, absence of continuity
—all are contributing factors to
inertia which is so frequently criti-
cized.

Look at the attendance ‘records
of." the student council meetings,
examine the files of the activities
and academic duties of our campus
leaders, then count the number of
seniors who are entering their
second year of service inour As-
sembly. Figure it out for your-
self.

It must also be remembered, de-
spite internal revolution, consti-
tutional revision, and acid criti-
cism, that students can go only so
far in their legislation. Our best
effort to change existing policies
and correct faulty conditions must
necessarily end in the form of a
recommendation to administrative
officers.

To permit students to make
changes in curricula, buy parking
lots for Universities, or change
routines of student health services
would undoubtedly be adminis-
trative folly. Students, being im-
pulsive, require balance wheels
and checks—though straight-jack-
ets are unnecessary.

Let’s Define Powers

To quote a clean of Midwestern
university when questioned as to
the success of student government
at his school:

“Well, we’ve done without it
and got along‘ pretty well; we've
been afflicted with it and still
kept going along as usual; but it
does give the students good’prac-
tice in conducting meetings.”

Maybe he is right—who knows?

However, thevleast we-can do
for our staggering». legislative body
is to define the powers which it
does and should posess, to put

teeth into its actions; to assure it

a hand in major campus problems.

With these powers once estab-

lished, the inertia will disappear
only in proportion to‘ 'the interest,
time, andrenergy expended by its
personnel. Then it is up to the
voter. ‘

It will be well for the critics
of student‘. government to come
forth  their suggestions, whe-
ther constructive I or not, before
the proposed: legislation to increase
SFA’s powers is introduced.

Only too’ often is the most Vitu-
perative critic the last to offer a

helping hand or a_V_c_ons_trgctiveV

suggestion" to 'refr‘iedy ' the evil
which he so blatantly deplores.

To Amend Document,

Of Student-Faculty Organization

Suspension of regular amendment procedure as outlined in
.~‘.mendment XI of ‘the. Student-Fa culty -Association
and substitution of a special methodof change, was voted at a.
meeting of the SFA assembly ’l‘uesda_v evening. . .

e The motion for change of rules, which was made by Albert.
Barr, BA38. was proposed to amend the SPA constitution and

to redefine powers of the organi
formulated by a committee re-9
cently appointed by the executive]
committee. 0

Considered over the protest of
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men and student ac-
tivities director, Barr’s proposal
moved‘ that Amendment XI be
suspended and replaced by the fol-
lowing substitute:

“That the amendments now un-

"CHEER BLOCK

Earlier in thé meeting, D. C.
Schultz, B A 3 8, demonstration
block chairman, reported that the V
student cheer block, as now con-
stituted, is failing because of a
lack of student interest. Schultz
also announced that students from
the School of Dentistry have been .
asked to join the block.

After several proposals to solve
it was agreed that the best solu-
tion will be to distribute equip-
ment to members of. the block at
the Stadium before each game, .
and to collect it immediately fol-
lowing. Thi_s plan, it was indi-
cated, may be put into effect next
week.

Schultz also announced that a
student “Pep” assembly is being
planned for Friday, November 13,
the day before the Nebraska game.

Announcement was made by
Bernard Cashdollar, BA38, about
dent lunroom on the ground floor
of the Cathedral. He also reveal-
ed that 50O to 700 lockers are be-
ing installed on the ground ﬂoor
and will be available probably
Monday. A check room is also
being considered, he declared.

Turnabout

Two students with bushy hair, beetled eyebrows,
and thick spectacles were discussing politics. Class
had just been dismissed and, evidently, they had
been stirred. They spoke heatedly, gesticulating
wildly.

“Now as for your contention which seeks to
offer basis for the coming revolution,” Herb be-
gan. “You imply that the need for a strong leader
is imminent. I, on the contrary, believe that the
need, the crying need, is for a deﬁnitely ‘interested
populace.”

“Possibly so,” Gregory answered. “But, Herb,
don’t you see that first we ‘must have a forceful and
intelligent leader in order to stir up the people.

Categorically it must be said

that most of life is love, or counterwise,

that most of love is life, or then, instead,

that love and life are one: of equal size,

of equal length and breadth and equal form,
and both contribute gently to the mind

that rocks and tumbles in the roaring storm

of thought and counter-thought. Or so we ﬁnd.

And then we think of Love in abstract style,

as recommended by the bearded bards

who pour out reams of verse. who blandly smile
considering the stacking of the cards.

But as for me, above the tumult’s swell,
I think that love is fine, "that Love is hell.

’Someone_,told' me we were, going ‘to have a.._de—

different tiewspapers. They still don’t add up.
In the Tﬁi'st"place, the papers netted the following
results, which you can ﬁgure out on your own comp-'

1937," paid $1,056,000,000r in corporation taxes, which

paid f~31,'263,'l00,000 in social security taxes and un-
employment insurance.

Yet the government, in the ﬁscal year from July
1, 1937 to July 1, 1938 will spend from $2,500,‘J00,000
to $3,800,000,000 less than they spent in the last
ﬁscal year.

Partly is this due to less actual spending, partly
to the lack of a soldier’s bonus this year, and part
to the withholding of money from purchasing chan-
nels. (The government calls spending to help the
purchasing power “expenditures stimulating con-
sumption in the first instance,” but I can’t pro-
nounce that, so we’ll just call it spending.)

These taxes, said the paper severely, come sud-
denly and directly out of the people’s pocketbooks,
yet nothing is put directly back into these pocket-
books-—which means that the purchasing power of
each dollar is reduced.

On the other hand, I talked to an economics stu-
dent about this, and now I’m all mixed up. Be-
cause Ilt seems that the economists View is this: if
the money taken in taxes is diverted back into busi-
ness, :?t will be used in the long run not to hire more
men, but to make technological improvements,
which will throw more men out of work, which will
add to WPA and relief expenses.

And adding this mob of unemployed to the eight
million we already have will make another de-
pression.

The only way to cause a boom right now, say a
few people, -is to bring on another war.
this, we should postpone the depression for a few
years.

But somehow, when I ﬁgure it up, I still get us
in another depression. _ .

End Of An American Epoch

 

Aubry

-—Lately‘the_~ newspapers have been carrying stories about the

‘R-cpiiblicaiis girding their loins -to do battle with the Democrats,

who are now ensconced in the seats of the mighty and enjoying
theiiiilk and honey of the land.

Now if the question of a revived Republicanism is to be
more than just the aiigry buzzing of discontented “outs” it

must have a philosophy, both of‘?

theory and of practice, which will
give it valid claim on the allegi-
ance of great masses of voters.

. If the motive is simply to per-
mit the proper functioning of a
democratic constitutional republic
which demands two wel1—orgaiii-
zed national political parties the
Republicans, I think are doomed
to failure. Parties‘ prosper despite
issues but they cannot exist with-
out issues, or at best with recog-
nizably ﬁctitious" issues.

THE UNHOLY THREE

It is difficult to impute to-the
revivers a greater status than
wranglers 0 ve r chicken-feed
prestige.‘The present tragedy of
traditional Republicans is that
neither Landon, Hoover, nor Ham-
ilton, nominal heads of the party,
have given any indication that
anything has happened in the U.
S. since 1929.

I do not wish to trail after these
sentences the befuddling aura of
mystic probability, but it does
seem to me thathistorians of the
future will have a tendency to
mark 1929 as theend of one epoch
in American history and the be-
ginning of another; just, as 1800
signa1ized_the end of the Federal-
ists and the‘New England mer-
chant traders, and at the same
time ushered in the agrarian dem-
ocrats of the south and what was
then the west. The more you think
about it the morestriking the,_par-
allel becomes. “

It is not simply because the

it is an important date, but because
1929 shocked the American mind

into realizing that there was no
longer _ a frontier, physical or
idcalogical. '

“EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION’?

And if there is no longer this
leit motif ofithe frontier to be
reckoned with in practical politic-
al philosophy some other theme,
some other generalization, as val-
uable as the frontier was then,
must be advanced to ﬁll the gap.
The trio of Republicans above
noted have not evinced any sign
that they are able to fill the gap.

And neither has Roosevelt in
any more than a very broad sense
given "promise of a more adequate
philosophy. vHe, itseems to me,
has struck a resounding chord in
the declaration, overt or implied,
that there must-be a more equita-
ble distribution of the national in-
come.

But there has come from him no
tactical plan as to how this may
be done, except as you may wish
to regard the see-sawing back and
forth of economic policies as steps
in this direction.

Moreover, when the accounts
are cast up, it appears to me that
these policies are reﬂexes rather
than actions, that they are more
or less blind reactions to a present
critical situation rather than a
conscious consideration of means
to achieve an objective. And such
attempts tend to aggravate rather
than mitigate the already serious
social situation.

AlumriiATssociation
Campaign Fills Quota

Well over the 4,000 members?

quota set for the drive, the Gen-
eral Alumni Association of the
University concluded its 15-day
membership campaign Wednesday

evening in the Pittsburgh Athletic

Association.

Reports compiled today, ac-
cording to Robert R. Gaw, P14,
campaign chairman, brought
Alumni Association membership
to 4,336, highest since 1924.

‘CLEAN UP’

Campaign chairmen for all nine
school associations affiliated with
the General Association promised
a “clean up” of remaining pros-
pects on their lists which will
bring the total membership to
5,000 by November 1, Mr. Gaw
predicted. ’

Although the campaign’s chief
effort was conﬁned to Allegheny

County, Pitt clubs of a score of

other cities have been conducting
their own campaigns. Their re-
ports, Mr. Gaw said, will bring in

several hundred more. member-_

ships, probably setting in 1937-38
an all-time high for the Associa-
tion.
COACH SPEAKS

Following reports, Dr. John B.

Sutherland spoke.

Norman MacLeod, BA17, intro-
duced to the 300 campaign work-
ers Marshall Goldberg, Harold
“Curley” Stebbins, Frank Patrick,

and football manager A1 Barr.

Only four school associations
failed to exceed their quotas. The
College, with 551 new member-
ships, fell short by" three. Dent-
istry, reporting 428, was 46 under
its quota. Law was 52 short of

 Letters
Editor,  Pitt News:
Dear Siri   ;,  in _, .

A letter inyithjis ll column, pur-
porting to come -from the’ pen of
a University professor, charges
budding} _en;bryo‘n..i°.
(sic) with rigiiiiieig, (sic) rules con-
cerning iiinthe Cathedral.
Sir, we rise indignantly to refuse
this baseless, charge.

Sir, the habit of smoking is not
a vice: it is the handmaidcn of all
the arts, man’s solace in the hour
sans pareil ofythe New World to
the'O1d. ' ’

Further,‘the smoking‘ of cigar-
ettes indisputably lessens the acid-
ity of the smoker’s system. Is this
not the reason, Sir, why your. true
smoker is» a man of large toler-
ance, not -easily put out by the
petty vicissitudes of daily life,
sharing the beneﬁts of earths
fruits with his fellow mortals in
fumatory fraternity? (See Barry,
“My Lady Nicotine,” passim).

Does not this truth explain, Sir,
why the systems of those not so
soothed by the gentle vapor of the
weed contain a high degree of
acidity?

And is this not so self-evident
as to require no further proof
that those dedicating their lives
to an understanding of the Law
would be the last to violate the
wise and beneﬁcent ruling for
those properly in authority?

We remain, Sir, more in sorrow
than in anger, your humble serv-

ant,

last Friday, under the lights, 7-0,
by Temple. T

The Kiltie eleven outplayed the
Owls last week, chalking up seven
first and tens to but one for Tem-
ple. The Kernmen lost this game
in a driving rain, when a poor
punt set the stage for an Owl
score.

FOOTBALL TACTICS

Pitt, with Goldberg carrying the
ball, the line better than ever, and
Souchak and Daddio charging like
mad sprinters, delivered an im-
pressive shellacking t.o Wisconsin,
21-0. Previously although ﬁght-
ing a scoreless draw with Ford-
ham and beating Ohio Wesleyan,
West Virginia and Duquesne, they
had been disappointing.

Coach Kern will ﬁeld a light,
comparatively green team, con-
tinually hampered by crippled
regulars. But they are the tradi-
tional Tech scrappers, and possess
an offense that is a real threat,
even to the Panthers. Their de-
fensive strength can be measured
by the little scoring done against
them by heavier and more ex-
perienced teams.

TECH PLAYERS

The Skibos have uncovered a
half-dozen good backs——-Condit,
Carnelly, Kopcsak, Lee, Matelan,
and Rosenthal. Friedlander, a
rugged sophomore, whom it was
hoped, would develop into a strong
passing and blocking quarterback,
was injured in the Notre Dame
fracas, and will not be available
for the remainder of the season.

Whitey Lee, the fast line—bucker,
who has ridden the bench for sev-
eral weeks due to a shoulder frac-
ture, has been scrimmaging all this
week and will start at fullback.
Lee is in many minds the best 10-
cal line plunger.

Condit is another soph with
great promise. He runs, passes,
and boots. Kopcsak and Carnelly
rate with some of the best Panther
backﬁeld players. It was Kopcsak
who scored the nine points against
the Irish. Yaney Rosenthal is one
of the speediest open ﬁeld runners
in the city, but has seen little ac-
tion because of injuries.

PITT-TECH LINE-UP

In the line Tech depends chieﬂy
on the biff-banging guard play of
Johnny Kawchak and Captain
‘Charley Miskevics, who although
demoted to the second eleven
early in the week, will, in all
probability, be in at his familiar
center job when the opening whis-
tle sounds.

The Tartan mentor plans to start
two new ends, Striegel and How-
arth. Musial will be at the other
-guard. Swab will be at right
tackle and Sutherland or Slaminko
in the other tackle position. The
starting backﬁeld will be com-
prised of Kopcsak, Carnelly, Con-
dit, and Lee. In case Kern keeps
Captain Miskevics out, sophomore
Schmidt will take over the pivot
post.

Dr. Sutherland plans to send the
same crew against the Tartans that
faced the Badgers last Saturday—
Souchak and Daddio at the wings;
Matisi and Delich, tackles; Lezou-
ski and Petro ﬂanking Dannies at
center; Chickerneo will call the
plays, Goldberg and Stebbins on
the saddles; and Patrick at full-
back.

Entries Into Tourney

_From Independents

_With the Independent league
scheduled to swing into action
Thursday a week and only two
teams registered, Harvey Rooker,
director of intramural atletics is
beginning to worry.

He has made arrangements for
as many as 13 participants in his
independent elimination tourney
and in order to draw them all into
the fold in time to schedule dates
he has set the deadline for Oc-
tober 30. g

All applications for entrance
must be filed at Rooker’s office
and the entrance fee paid no later
than noon Saturday.

NEW TEAMS

Last year the Independent
league showed only four teams,
but under Rooker this season it
will sport at least ten participants
representing organized groups.

Augmenting the two left‘ove'rs,
from last year’s round—robin af-
fair, the Newman Club and Kappa
Alpha Phi, will be elevens from
the following group: Dents, Meds,
Mines, EE’s, ME’s, ChE’s, AE’s,
the College Biz Add’s and a YMCA
team.

Complete cooperation from each
group will be necessary to see
Rooker’s splendid idea carried
through to a successful climax and
he urges action to be taken im-
mediately by filling out the en-
trance blanks.

WANTS FROSH TEAMS

Rooker also requests each men
counsellor in the freshmen orien-
tation classes to organize his class
into a team and enter the Fresh-
men orientation touch football
tourney. The winner in this event
will meet the Independent winner
for a place in the finals against
a fraternity eleven for the intra-
mural title.

Requirements in this league are
the same as the Independent
league. All entries must be ﬁled in
Rooker’s office no later than Octo-
ber 4. The usual dollar fee is also
included. Schenley Oval has been
secured for all the games. Reser-

Schricker Calls Mitt
Candidates Today .

The leather pushers are in
again.

L Boxing coach Jack Schricker
issued a call this ‘morning for
all boxing candidates to report
to the Stadium boxing quart-
ers at 3:30 Monday afternoon.

The leather pushers face the
toughest list of opponents that
they have ever had on a box-
ing schedule. According to

Schricker, if the Panthers “wish
to enjoy any degree of success,
they must be given the whole-
hearted support of the student
body?’ ,

Schricker further stated that
a boy does not have to have
had any ring experience to
make a place for himself on
the Pitt boxing team. To back
up this statement he points out
the fact that ninety-ﬁve per
cent of the boxing team is
made up of non-experienced
students.

Harrier Teams
Face Bethany,

Canonsburg

Although the Panther varsity
harriers remain idle over the
week—end, the junior varsity hill
and dalers will travel to Bethany,
West Virginia, to run against the
Bethany Bisons. The freshman
team will meet the Canonsburg
high school harriers Schenley
Park.

The Bethany meet is the second
time this season that a Pitt hill
and dale squad has run against
the West Virginians. Earlier in
the fall the varsity harriers thor-
oughly trounced "che Bethany boys
in Schenley Park.

Although the Olsonmen thor-
oughly trounced the Bisons in that
earlier meet, Coach Carl Olson
after watching the meet made the
prediction that with a few more
weeks practice the Bethany har-

When we visited the Skibo field

coach Bill Kern, the first football
tutor we met was Dr. Eddie Baker,
Kern’s assistant. Our conversation
ran as follows:

Interviewer: “Can you give »me
a story of the game?”

Dr. Baker: “What game?”

Us: “The Pitt-Tech game.”

Dr. B.: “We’re not going to show
up.”

Us: “Cut it out, we know you
have the Tartans all set for this
meeting.” .
. Dr. B.: “I wish we felt the same
i way, but Pitt is just too tough for
|us.’

, After digesting this profundity,
we were further enlighten-ed by
Brother Kern, whose smile is more
winning than a 60 to 0 score.
KERN OPTIMISTIC ,

Coach Kern: “Playing against
Pitt will feel very strange. The
Panthers are better this year and
we are obviously weaker. We’ll
be satisfied to hold them as well
as Wisconsin. We hope Pitt wins
every game~—but this one.”.

Publicity director Maxie Han-
num, and freshman basketball
coach “Red” Silverman were of
the same opinion.

Der Maxie: “We’ve lost our best
ball players. We can only hope to
keep the score down.” .

“Red”: “Pitt finally showed
what they are made of last Satur-
day. They made a good team look
poor—-very poor. ,Tech will be
fighting, as usual, but that won’t
be enough.”

Kern’s other assistants, Sklad,a-
ny, Kutz, and Weinstock, were not
on the campus. Thgeirbosstspoke

of basketball, is sponsoring the
yearly event to provide new and
inexperienced men with the op-
portunity to show their ability on
a basketball floor, as well as to
have some fun.

He will have some of the varsity
players down to help referee, and
to act as observers, so that if you’re
out for a chance on" the varsity,
you will have plenty opportunity
to be seen. Not only to be seen,
but to play.

A system has been worked out
that allows every one to play. Be-
ginning at 3 o’clock, players
will start to show up. The first
ten to show up will start and play
an eight minute quarter. While
they rest, the second ten, having
chosen sides, begin to play. When
the second ten rests after a quar-

this way, Dr. Carlson expects to
have time enough for anyone to
play. ,

Bureau Notes
Sales Increase  

Wholesale and retail sales last
month were approximately 18 per »
cent greater than those in Sep-
tember a year ago, and combined
business in the ﬁrst nine months
was 20.0 per cent greater than that
in the comparable month of 1936,
according to the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research.

Combined dollar sales of all
wholesale stores rose 3.8 per cent
from August to September, a gain
w_hich is larger than average.
Sales in September exceeded those
in September last year by 4.6 per
cent.

Aggregate sales of all reported
wholesale stores were approxi-
mately 13 per cent greater in the
ﬁrst nine months of" 1937 than in
the ﬁrst nine months a year ago,
the Bureau stated.

Despite the sales increase, busi-
ness in the Pittsburgh district
made another serious decline last
week. Business here has been
dropping for four consecutive
weeks, during which time the the
Bureau's general index of busi-
ness has slumped 18.2 points.

Production schedules showed
counter.-,-seasonal decreases in
nearly all the major industries in
the district, curtailment in the
iron and steel industry being es-
pecially severe.

History Group

Europe.” Dr. Alfred Proctor James
and Dr. N. Andrew N. Cleven,

ognition atpthe Faculty Clubon

thedral. The occasion was the
club’s progressive bridge party
last night. I

Commenting on the project, Dr.
J. S. Taylor, professor of mathe-
matics and social chairman of the
club, said, “Brieﬂy, the plan is
this——At the end of the evening’s
play, the players vote on the
kibitzers. At this time, each ka-
bitzer is requested to comment on
the play of the evening as a whole.

“Players are prvileged to crosss-
examine the kibitzers and to
call attention to any signiﬁcant
display of strength or weakness
exhibited by the kibitzers. Bal-
lots are cast both with‘ refer-
ence to the kibitzing prowess dis-
played‘ during play: and on‘ the
basis of analyses given by kibitz-
ers of the play. ..

“While the plan‘ in question is
something of an innovation, it-' is
only ﬁtting that the Faculty‘ Club
pay this small tribute to kibitzing
art. We numberamong our mem-
bership’ some ofthe best kibitzers

(Continued from Page 1)
more honest than the rest, owns
weaker women. ‘-

Yet not a single woman of those

polled wants a husband she can
dominate——intellectually.

Marriage before the age of 25
is desired by 69 per cent of the
women on campus; ﬁve per cent
declare they expect never to mar-
ry, and the remainder hope to
take the oath of eternal loyalty
between" the ages‘ of 25 and 30.
None expect—or at least want-
to make an alliance‘ after 30.

The majority of men, on the
other hand, will wait until they
are between 25 and 30—about 62
per cent; Of those who do not
wish to marry at this time, 26 per
cent of all the men polled will
consummate the marriage rela-
tionship before "the age of 25, and
10 per cent will marry after 30.
About 2 per cent of the male stu-
dents do not expect to marry.

Asked how great an income
they would expect before under-
taking marriage, students de-
clared that 30 dollars a week was
not enough. Of the women, 59
per cent asserted their demand
for more, while 38 per cent would
take a ﬂing at married life on
something between 25 and 30 dol-
lars. About three per cent would
take a chance on less than 25 dol-
lars a week, but only two fresh-
man girls on less than 20 dollars.

Of the men, about 52 per cent
insist on more than 30 dollars a
week before attempting marriage,
while 48 per cent are willing to
try it on between 25 and 30 dollars
of income a week.

University students are over-
whelmingly in favor of having
no more than two- or three chil-
dren. A majority of 65 per cent
want‘ only two. About 28 per
cent prefer to have three, while
most of the remainder want one,
four, and a few scattered per-
sons ﬁve or six. Women are

strongly in favor of two, while ‘
men are a considerable bit more .

favorably disposed toward three.

If wishes mean anything, most .— A

of the University students of to-
day will be living in suburban
areas. A percentage of 57 per cent
aspire to become suburbanites,
and cultivate a little garden and
a ﬂower bed, it seems. Approxi-
mately 41 per cent choose the
lights and glamor of the city,
while two per cent are going rus-
tic. ,

another question.” '

“We will get ‘no solution of" the
problem if we think in terms of
hate and punishment. But I be-
lieve that the utility operators are
sufficiently realistic to see that the
era of proﬁts through capitaliza-
tion and reﬁnancing is over.”-

STREETS IMPROVED

Streets must be improved and
new boulevards built in Pitts-
burgh, but they must be paid for
by bond issues or increased taxes,
said the speaker.

He explained that the City
Planning commission, the Better
Traffic committee, the Western
Pennsylvania Engineers’ society,
and state and county authorities
were co-operating on a long—range
program of traﬂic control."

“It seems inevitable that low-
costhousing must become a gov-
ernment obliga_t_ion;, since unsubsi-
dized private capital shuns this
ﬁeld. We can- no longer afford
slums, and thedisease, crime, and
industrial inefﬁciency they breed,”
stated Mr. Scully.

The‘ $28,000,000 housing pro-
gram which has been planned dur-
ing the past 18 months by the City
Planning commission, should
spread prosperity through every
channel of industry in the city,
the mayor said. _

“Flood control for Pittsburgh is
now an actual fact,” said the
Democratic" candidate. “The Ty-
-gart dam on the Monongahela
river, and the dam at Crooked
creek on the Allegheny will reduce
the crest of any ‘combination’
ﬂoods by eight or nine feet.”

In answer to student questions,
mayor Scully declared:

1. That he is opposed to the
proposed state income tax.

2., That he does not intend to
do anything about adoption of the
city-manager plan for Pittsburgh.

3. That he is opposedtov the
idea of the sit—down strike.

the party to initiate such proposals
if it wants them,” he continued.

Asked about the Democratic at-

‘ititude on the closed shop and the

sit-down strike, Mr. Scully ex-
plained, “I don’t speak for the
Democratic party, because the
party never made a pronounce-
ment on the subject. ' My personal
attitude is covered by the law as

“The sit—down strike’ came to
America with a wave of mob hys-
teria and bad manners, and if con-

tinued might have led to'some- -

thing worse. I believe that the
sit-down is not right, and that
there will be few such’ strikes in
the future.” 4 4

Because Pittsburgh is such an
idealspot for the location of in-
dustries, the city is now entering
upon an “industrial renaissance,”
which will again make this dis-
trict “the workshop of the world,”
Mayor Scully believes. ‘
