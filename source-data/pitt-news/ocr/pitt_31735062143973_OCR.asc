OK Releases
New Tappees

Omicron Delta Kappa, national
leadership honor society for men,
will place the names of tappees
today on a large key located in the
Commons Room.

It has been the tradition of the
past to announce the names of
tappees in such fashion on the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving
vacation. During the war, such
practice was discontinued, but this
year the organization has planned-
to revive this method of tapping.
Posting ofnames will begin at 9
o’clock, and conclude at 12:30
o’clock.

Men tapped to ODK must have
an average of 1.8. and also have
scholastic standing in the upper
third: ofthe class; intelligent serv-
ice and leadership in campus life,

and _consecrati.on to democratic

ideals. Each year one senior man,
having attained recognition as
outs_t'and.ing in scholastic achieve-
ment“and activities, is honored by
havinghis name inscribed on the
ODK walk leading from. Heinz
chapel.

The eleventh University News-
letter, written quarterly by T. W.
Bid-dle, Dean of Men, went out
this week to more than 6,500 Pitt-
ites serving in the armed forces
all over the world‘.

Chatty and‘ informal, the News-
letter is a c-o.mpen~d.i’um of campus
activ.ities' interspersed with quota-
tions from the many letters Dean
Biddle receives from Pitt men
and women serving evetywhere.

Dean Biddle said that the News-
letter is one way, in many cases
the only way, Pitt gra~d:uate»s and
former sltudents thousands of miles
apart can keep in ‘touch with each
other. “Each time I think the let-
ter is too long,” he said, “but
when I receive letters from fellows
telling me they read it over ten
times and more, I lmow it’s worth
all the effont I can give it.”

A novel method of charging ad-
mission will be used, according to
-Betty Jane Wood, chairman of the
Traditions committee, “Each girl
will be charged admission on a
basis of -her age,’ she said‘. “She
will be charged as many coins as
she is old, and can make payment
in pennies, dimes, or nic1.;e1;s,”

Women’s Self Goevernment As-
sociation has set up the following
rules for participating in and
judging the contest:

1. Each class will -have no more
than ten minutes in -which to pre-
sent its! program.

2. No more ’r.h:m 15-people may
take part in the 5:1-:it-accompanying
the music.

3. No more than ﬁve dollars
may be spent by ea1Qh.€,18SS-

4- Singing may be accompanied
or unaccompanied.

Judging will be baped on the
following points: attpndance 25
percent, ori.gina,lity 35 percent,
singing 20 percent, appearance 15
percent, and enthusiasm 15 per-

to 300 letters each month from
Pitt men and women in the serv-
ice. From these letters and from
campus activities, he incorporates
the news which he thinks will be
of greatest interest to ‘those in the
armed forces.

Mailinig addresses and service
records of each graduate or former
student known to be in the service
are kept by Miss Alena Horner of

Frieda Hammermeister will lead
the responsive reading and the re-
sponsive prayer. “Prayer of
Thanksgiving,” a traditional Dutch
tune of the season, will be sung by
the Heinz Chapel choir.

The altar will be decorated dur-
ing the service with fruit, grain,
and candles by the Altar Guild.
This guild, under the direction of
Mrs. Edna Batz, executive secre-
tary of the Young Women’s Chris-
tian Association, decorates the
altar at every Thanksgiving serv-
ice. Guild members for this year
are: Joanne Goldman, Louvoun
Grob, Ellen Moorhead, Corinne
Nelan, Nancy Piper, and Alice
Wanzer.

In giving the reasons for the ab-
sence of a sermon at this year’s
service, Dr. Farmer said, “Many
people have requested an all mu-
sical program. Then, too, I feel
that the spirit of the holiday is
best expressed by group participa-
tion in singing hymns of thanks.”

Special organ music, played by
Fred Lotz, University organist,
will accompany the program.
“Thanksgiving” from the oratorio
“Ruth ” by Frederick Cowen, and
a choral prelude “Thanksgiving”
by Cunningham Woods will form
the prelude. Francis Sno,w’s “Dis—
tant Chimes” will be played for
oifertory.

The postlude “Harvest March”
by J. Batiste Calkin will conclude
the service at 1:25 o’clock.

bers are invited to attend.

Back in 1846 a woman editor began a campaign to have one
pzirticu'.a.i" day set aside each year ‘to be observed as a national
day of tl'12n1ksgiving. Not that the various communities did not
observe one day of the year on which to take count of the bene-
ﬁts and blessings they had received since settling in this country,
but the editor of Godey’s Lady’s Book, Sarali Josepha Buell
I-Ialc, felt that if one certain day was proclaimed as Thanksgiv-
ing Day, it would serve as a bond between the people and the
nation. Thus, each year about June or July she would edit any
number of articles froin that time on to November pleading for
the cstablislnnent of such a celebration. True, in 1789, President
\Vashington made a proclamation for observance of Thanksgiv-
ing Day, but the practice was discontinued until 1863 when Mrs
l‘Ialc’s constzint urging brought about -at second p1‘0Clﬂlll£l.tl0ll
from President Lincoln. The date was set then as November 26.

There has been much. debate and disciissi.on as to iylicther
we should have compulsory peacetime military training in this
country. The arguments presented by both sides seem sound
and reasonable, and ttherefore it is difficult for the average
citizen to make up his mind as to whicli side of the fence he
is on. ,

Our answer to this very vital question is determined by the
kind of world we believe man is capable of making for himself.
I do not feel that man is a selfish,‘ egotistical, greedy, and ag-
gressive creature. I do believe he can be reasonable, that he
truly desires peace, and that he can be guided by the golden
rule. Therefore I know there can be pernianent peace for which
there are better ways of achieving it than by preparing for bat-
tle.

NG\\'ll€l'Q in history do we ﬁnd~—as many would have us
believe--any evidence that a strong inilitziry machine was able
to prevent the outbreak of war. ’l‘lm1'c is absolutely no proof
that Japan would not have attacked the United States had we
been prepared. They certainly could not, in December 1941,
count on our stupidity and laxity of discipline at Pearl llarbor.
\Var ttoday moves on pilotless wings and the contention that 3
large army would prevent an attack of that type. is entirely false.

On the other hand, history shows evidence that in this world
of power competition, a strong military machine has actually
provoked war. The peoples of Europe have carried the burden
of compulsory military conscription for a century and a half.
The result was a continual struggle for military supremacy in
Europe which ﬁnally involved the entire world.

It is also true that, in order to supply a large standing army,
the entire industry of a country must be partially geared to the
production of war material. Not only does this prevent us from
devoting our. entire energies to peacetime production, but-—
ancl infinitely worsc~—it cannot help but make us war conscious.
ll’ differences should arise between this country and a foreign
power, rather than rely on conciliation and arbitration, our
pcople would be all too ready to use the army which would be
available. ,

. _It is obvious then that compulsory peacetime military train-
ing 1S no:t.the medium for the prevention of wars. In view of
this fact, it can hardly be understood why our newspapers are
so in favor of compulsory military conscription. unless they have
so completely lost their faith in humanity that they believe war
to be inevitable. .

_ I do not hold with this cynical attitude. I believe that war
1S not inev1t.a.ble,.because man can be guided by higher princi-
ples than those of aggression and because he truly desires peace.

By Burke and Biieher

Heigh ho, it's vacation time
again, and, brother, do we like
these three-day weeks. Why?
Well, because it gives the Y-Liners
time to catch up on all the latest
good books . and things. If
=rou’d like to join our campaign for
che four day week-end, just come
up to the Y office; we have peti-
tions all over the place. (There’s
that nasty word again.)

But on to the events of the week,
ind a sneak preview of what's to
zome. First of all there’s :1 Chapel
service at 12:45 o’elock today.
Frieda Hammermeister is the stu-
lent leader, and Dr. Farmer will
preach.- This is your chance to
combine Wednesday and Friday
nto one, so come on to Chapel.

A strictly negative note is that
here will be no Pitkin Club to-
night. All you Pitkiners read and
ament, for there’s no dinner-dis-
.-ussion until next week. —

That’s all for this week, but lis-
ten to what’s coming up: Dr. T.
l.Koo, the famous World Student
Christian Federation traveller is
coming to Pitt the first week in
December. The occasion is WSSF
week. You don’t know what
WSSF is? Well, now’s the time to
find out because you’re going to be
hearing a lot about it. «-

WSSF stands for the World Stu-
dent Service Fund, which provides,
books, writing materials, and dur-
ing the war, food for university
students all over the world. Somg
of the best WSSF work through
the past years has been in prison
camps in both the Allied and 0(5-
cupied countries. The British boys.
in Germany and our own Ameri-
can lads in the Paciﬁc war cam?
can tell you that WSSF was one 
the few things that kept them from
going completely “rockhappy.” '

The job of the World Student
Service Fund isn’t done with the
end of the war, though, for today
in a typical Czechoslovakian uni-
100,000 students. Without us, the
untouched nations, WSSF can do
nothing. It’s up to us to help pro-
vide that “brave new world a’corii-
ing!” Are you ready? Then here’s
your opportunity.

H-APP,Y THANKSGIVING!

A one-day conference, sponsored
by the history diepartment on No-
vember 16 fonr the purpose of
studying the role of science ‘amnd
technology in tlhe present age. was
attended by 50 leading historians

from several universities and the
armed forces.

Dr. J. Fred IRippy, professor of
history at the University of Chi-
cago, addressedi the group regard-
ing,-‘ “The Teclhnological Invasion
of South America.” Citing a long
list of United States companies en-
gaged inentergirises of all sorts all
over Latin Anrarica, he said,

“To limit our investigation of
inter-Americam relationships to
diplomacy andl cultural contracts
is to neglect the: most fundamental
factors. We small never under-
stand the relatinns of the two Am-
ericas until we: lhave become thor-
oughly familiair with the econom-
ics and technollgical relationships
and their significance.

ward nations are more eager than
ever before for the machines, de-
vices, and formulas of the indus-
trial age. And even if they were
less eager they might have to ac-
cept them because of the over-
whelming pressure of our time.
The next quarter of a century is
almost certain to witness tremend-
ous efforts to further industrial-
ization in China, India, and other
countries. Most of the nations of
Latin America share the general
enthusiasm. They are longing for
the security and prosperity which
they expect home industries to
bring.

“The trend of the times requires
the revision of our history, giving
more attention to the international
migration of capital and technol-
ogy,” Dr. Rippy concluded.

Dr. Arthur M. Schlesinger of
Harvard, former president of the
American Historical Association,
made the address at a dinner
meeting in the University Club
which closed the conference. .He

philosophy and religion at Western '
Maryland College. A native of
Couley, Louisiana, he was gradu-

degree of bachelor of arts in 1925.-
He-received his master of arts de-

College Coeds Take Beauty Naps
On Twenty-eighth Floor

Out of the libraries to the twenty-eighth ﬂoor.

Since the Wom-

en’s Health Service has offered the use of one of their adjoining offices
as sleeping quarters for girls who wish to rest between classes, this
sleeping room on the twenty-eighth ﬂoor has become one of the most

popular habitats of women on the campus.

A clock is placed in an advan-9
tageous position so that the 40
winkers may make that next class.
The girls are also requested to sign
their names before going in. Since
the health service is usually
rushed with freshman physical ex-
aminations and the care of stu-
dents, the nurses can only wake
students in exceptional cases.

An invitation is extended to
freshman and transfer students
who are not already acquainted
with this Health Service function.

on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday evenings until 10
o’clock.

And to -correct a false impres-
sion that has been circulating, we
regret that the umbrella loan serv-
ice of this department has been
discontinued. This is just a little
after thought that has been in-
serted in this article to stop the
avalancheiof requests that ﬂood in
on rainy days. Perhaps a sugges-
tion can be made that in such an

emergency, the perplexed student
may sleep it over.

Many upperclasswomen are also
not aware that the ofﬁce is open

New Group
Organized By
Pharmacists

A student’s branch of the
American P'harm'aceutical associa-
tion was organized at the School
of Pharmacy Friday, November 9.

A constitution committee, con-
sisting of one elected representa-
tive from each of the School’s ﬁve
-classes, ‘made its -report to‘ the
student body November 2,‘ and
submitted fo-r adoption‘”a constitu-
tion for the proposed organization.
This constitution, unanimously
adopted‘ by the stud-er_1_t body, has
been forwarded to the national
headquarters of the A. 'Ph. A. in
Washington, D. C., for approval.

Oﬁicers of the new organization,
elected by the student body of the
Pharmacy school at its meeting
November 9 are as follows: E-velyn
I-Iartstein, ‘president; Richard Can-
ter, ﬁrst vice-p-resident; Gilbert
Little, second vice-president; How-
ard Schall, treasurer; and Frank
Creft, secretary.

‘Dr. Stephen
professor of-pharmacy, -said that
Pitt’s School of Pharmacy actually;
formed one of the first , student
branches of the A. Ph. A. in the
country in 1929. Subsequently,
however, other colleges formed
similar organizations. and then
-bound‘ themselves into a national
student’s branch.-A diﬁerence in
the rules of the national group
and Pitt’s own _ pioneer branch,
however, left the Pitt organization
to function independently until
1941" when the war temporarily
forced it into idleness,” Dr. “Wilson
said. R

Dr. Wilson, in commenting on
thesnew organization, stated, “The
School’s interest in such an or-
ganization is primarily to acquaint
the students with association work
on a smaller scale, in college, and
thus prepare them to take an ac-
tive part in the work of the Amer-
ican Pharmaceutical association
upon graduation.”

°lThrough The Years”-n
We Always Have Owl

WHOOOO started The Owl,
wh-en, and why? Do you know?

The Junior Class of the West-
ern University‘ of Pennsylvania,
published The Owl for the ﬁrst
time in 1907.

James Irwin Mc-Cormick, edi-
tor in chief, with the four asso-
ciated editors embodied the ambi-
tions of the group in the Editors’
Note as follows:

“The class of nineteen hundred
and seven of the Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, deeming it
ﬁtting ‘that the chronicles of the
institution
and;preserved~ in some lasting form
determined. upon establishment of
an annual publication to fill a neg-
lected place in the University life.
It is with sanguine hopes and. no
_li_ttle- ‘trepidation that the editors
are now prepared to introduce the
new annual to the friends of the
University. We have labored long

. and earnestly to produce a book

worthy of the University and of
-our class. The success. or failure of
the work will doubtless be evi-
denced by its reception. In the one
‘case we expect no eulogy, in the
other we beg no sympathy. We

hope for The Owl, that it may-

should be embodied

‘Tavern to meet
Stutly, and the ‘gang.
Bohemianatmosphere customs and

prove of interest to all, aﬁ'orr;1
amusement to some, and be a
source of offense to none.

The class dedicated The Owl to
Honorable ‘Thoinas Mellon, oldest.
living alumnus of the ‘University
at that time “recognizing the digg-
nity thus. gained (‘through alumn;)
for their infant publication;”

For IF Football League

  Meet the Team

Fullback, halfback, quarterback-—,-_I’ve got two fellows here that
can take care of all three very neatly. Hal Wertman divides his
time between fullback and halfback and Jack Smodic does the sig-
nal calling. And here's an encouraging thought. If any of you happen
to take sick in about nine or ten years from now, you can look up
D0Cl501‘S Smodic and Wertman. Yep, both Jack and Hal are Pre-Meds.

You’ve all heard the song. that goes “You’ve Got to be a Football

"9 On November 8th, a scrapping-

Sigma Chi football team upset the
league leading Phi Kapp’s by tie-
ing the latter 13-13. Going into
the fourth quarter, the champion
IF singers sported a thirteen point
lead. This was erased in the last
few minutes of play as the Phi
Kapp’s showed championship form‘
in scoring two rapid touchdowns.
This deadlock enabled the PiKA’s
to take the lead for a few days as
they were busy defeating a stub-
born Pi Lam outﬁt 30-10. Their
lead was very brief however as the
Phi Kapp’s came back the follow-

ing week to beat the Phi Gam’s
14-6. This Victory put the Phi

Kapp’s and PiKA’s into a two

way tie for the league lead.
The only other team which has

I not tasted defeat is the Phi Delt

outﬁt. Their 18-0 victory over the
SAE’s advanced them in the race
last Thursday. The only other
games played saw the Phi Ep’s
battle the Pi Lam’s to a 6-6 draw
ifter forfeiting to the Phi Gam’s a
week before.

In tomorrow’s headliner, the Phi
Kapp’s tangle with the Phi Delts
'11 what should be one of the best’
games of the season. Both teams

are undefeated and the loser will
probably be eliminated from the‘
race.

Not yet having recuperated from
a whirl of social events we’ve de-
cided t-o start at the end of the
alphabet and come up with:

The SAE’s ‘who although in the
midst of redec-orating their Lions’
den haven’t forgotten their social
life completely as they had the
Phi lMu’s for a dessert dance last
Friday. Hard: times will prevail
this ‘Saturday as they hold their
annual “hard times” dance along
with ‘their brothers from State and
Tech.

And right behind are the Pi
Lams who are busily working on
a party for their brothers from
State as they celebrate our victory
over State that same night.

It seems that the PiKAs are in
the same frame of mind as they
await the State game in order to
welcome their .Penn State broth-
ers in a’ monster beer party.

If you couldn’t find any Phi
Kaps last Friday night the reason
was that they were -out in full
force for the Seton Hill fall
formal. Tell me boys how do they
stack up against ours?

The Fijis who are now 42 strong
with the addition of Bob Gold—
strom to the fold -were quite busy
at the beginning of this week.
T-hey are having a dessert dance
on Monday night for the Tri Delts
and on the following night the
