Wilson started the discussion
by asking whether everyone in

explained this type of theory will

“They will be giving up

More than 175,000 women are
diagnosed with breast cancer a
year; of those, 44,500 will die,
according to the American Cancer

_ Society.

It is not detected early enough;
the time it takes to identify the
problem from the first
mammogram could be as long as
two months, and the anxiety and

confusion a women, experiences

when faced with the possibility
of breast cancer might lead to the
wrong decisions, according to
Herta Klaman, administrative
director of diagnostic imaging
Magee—Women’s Hospital
"recognized these problems and
as a result formed an outpatient

Breast Care Consultation Center. ,

The center will provide a single,
unified setting where the patient
can obtain a complete assessment
of the diagnosis, treatment and
support services, Klaman said.
“This type of center isthe only
one in the United States and is a
part of Magee’s plan to establish

‘a center of excellence in women’s
cancer,” Klaman said.

The center is set up so that
from 8:15 a.m. to 2 p.m. on
Thursdays, women who suspect
cancer —— either from a self
examination or an abnormal
mammogram —— or women with
a previous diagnosis who are
seeking second opinions or
treatments can come to Magee
and get a mammogram or have
blood work, bone scans and other
tests performed.

Then in the afternoon a team of
25 doctors who. specialize in
surgery, pathology, radiation
treatments, plastic surgery,
oncology and counseling come
together as a team to discuss
each case and give the patient
her options, Klaman said.

This. benefits the patient by
giving her more than one opinion
and. the ability to quickly initiate
a treatment, Klaman said.

The concept was introduced
by»-Dr. Kathleen Harris and Dr.
Scott Williams, chief of surgery at

Magee, who identified the need ,

for a team approach.

“By bringing all aspects of
patient care together, ‘it enables
professionals involved in the
prevention,
treatment of breast cancer to
interact on a professional level,”
Klaman said.

The center’s purpose is to limit
delays in treatment andtransferral
of records. It will also allow the
patient to avoid multiple

»-‘appointments with various
specialists and to shorten the
period the patient has to wait and
wonder, Harris said.

The day—long procedure at
Magee would normally take a
patient one to two months on her
own, Klaman said. The costs are
comparable to what the patient
would pay if she visited each
specialist individually.

A woman who found out about
the center travelled from
Kentucky to be evaluated and
within the week was operated
on. It wouldn’t have been
possible, Klaman said, without
the complete and comprehensive

For T be Pill News

An extensive five—year plan has
paid off for the University of
Pittsburgh Medical School.
Starting this fall, all incoming
medical students will be
introduced to a new curriculum
that involves changes intthe
method of teaching.

A group of 200 medical
professors and 50 medical
students led by Dr. Shelly Adeler,
assistant dean of Pitt’s School of
Medicine, were divided into
retreats or groups that developed
the new curriculum.

Several aspects of different
medical schools, such as Case
Western Reserve, Stanford and
McMasters, were all used to reach
a satisfactory curriculum that
would be challenging to the
students and technologically
advanced for the future.

According to Adeler, who is
also a professor of medicine at
Pitt, the new curriculum involves
six new principles. Some of these

variety oftechriiques for learning.
Another is the idea of

FA reviews computing
By Tara Harris

Staﬂ"Wr1'ler

The Faculty Assembly reviewed a proposal for enhancing
faculty computing during yesterday’s meeting.

The proposal, prepared by the ‘Senate Computer Usage
Committee, featured the goals of enhancing personal consultation
and-training for faculty, initiating a program to assist faculty in
obtaining computer equipment,,enhancing the ability of faculty
to use existing and future computer resources in teaching and
offering faculty more informationthat will enable them to make
knowledgeable software selections.

According to the proposal, mechanisms such as expanding
computing services for hardware, software and network usage
and establishing a procedure for ongoing analysis to determine
faculty computing needs in the future are vital for the attainment
of its goals.

The Faculty Assembly also reviewed’ a. proposal to institute
awards at the University of Pittsburgh for faculty public-service
activity. A

This proposal defines public service as “serious academic
activity which intends to provide public or community benefit,
related to a faculty member’s disciplinary expertise, done
outside of the university and where remuneration is not the
primary purpose of the activity." 9 .

The proposal offers examples of faculty members who are
doing or who have done noteworthy public services. One of
several mentioned was Fiore Pu gliano of the English department,
who makes CGS courses accessible to inmates at the State

Research assistant cites
role ofjapanese Women

‘By Donna Pesansky

' Sta_[)" Writer

When most Japanese women
decide to go to college, their goal
isn’t to make their first million by
age 25 or to be a corporate
president by 30 but to become a
wise mother and a good wife,
to Dr. Yasuko
Morinaga, a research assistant in
the psychology department.

“The idea in Japan is that
women need to be educated to
be women,” Morinaga said
yesterday in a speech given on
“Japanese Women in Higher
Education.”

Morinaga is a Fulbright scholar
who did her graduate and
undergraduate work at Hiroshima
University in Japan.

Thirty-five percent of the

' women in Japan who graduate

from high school go on to
secondary education. Of that,

about 22 percent go to a two-year
school and about 14 percent go
to a four-year school.

The two-year college is typically
a place where they can learn to
strengthen their secretarial skills
to get a job until a husband can
be found.

Other reasons womenattend
two-year schools’ are that they
failed the rigorous entrance exam
to a four-year, Japanese college,
can't" afford the costs of a four-
year institution or realize that
there is no room for them in the
corporate world, so they don’t
bother, Morinaga said.

The most popular majors for
the two-year schools are living
science or home economics and
humanities.

Women who do go to the four-
year colleges are often
encouraged to leave or not to
continue on to graduate school,

emergencies merge

By Vincent Gadrix
Staﬂ“ Writer

The University of Pittsburgh Medical.Center will move the
Montefiore University Hospital emergency department to the
Presbyterian University Hospital emergency department by July
1.

The university purchased Monteﬁore two years ago. In an
effort to operate the center’s trauma and emergency services in
a cost-effective manner, the center developed a long-term plan
in which emergency facilities at Montefiore and the Eye and Ear
Hospital would merge into the first-floor lobby level at
Presbyterian. ‘

The consolidation will make optimum use of available
resources, eliminate duplication of services at both locations
and eliminate the need for renovations at Montefiore emergency
department, according to Dr. Vince Verdile, director of the
emergency department at Presbyterian. ,

“This change will allow an increase in faculty and nursing
coverage in the emergency department,” he said.

The existing UPMC emergency department at Presbyterian
will expand to 29 rooms to accommodate an increase in patient
volume. The expanded emergency department will incorporate

$5 million in patient fees filtered

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

Five million dollars in patient
fees were ﬁltered to between 12
and 85 Pitt physicians between
1981 and 1987 instead of going
toward education and research
at the University of Pittsburgh

. School of Medicine, according to

an article published in
Monday's Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

“When the practice plans were

set up at Pitt, there was a basic,

rule: Doctors could keep fees
equal to their base salaries,
thereby doubling their pay. Today
they say ‘the double-pay rule is
strictly enforced, and each
plan undergoes an annual
outside audit,” the P0st—Gazette
reported.

Orthopedic Administratorjohn
Dillon said that the practice plans

» are separately incorporated

entities that function on their
own, under university guidelines,
and collect payments from
patients that are treated by Pitt
doctors.

University officials declined to
comment on the situation to The
Pitt News. . ‘

The first practice plan was
started in 1974 in the
anesthesiology department, with
orthopedic surgery and radiology
following close behind. Currently
Pitt has 15 plans.

According to the Post—Gazette,
former 19ittskin—cancer specialist
Dr. John A. Zitelli is attempting to
recover $1.2 million in fees that

  

ART UH-5441 03/92 U-HAUL0 lNT'L.

he generated from patients in the
mid~1980s.

Zitelli’s ﬁve-year suit will be
heading for round three at the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Zitelli won the first round at the
Allegheny County Common Pleas
Court, but he lost the second
round when Superior Court
Judge Patrick J. Tamilia ruled
that Pitt could keep the $1.2
million, the Post—Gazette report-
ed. _

The Post-Gazettesaid that
Zitelli states in his suit that he
may have broken some rules, but
so did many other doctors. He
said former Pitt medical school
Dean Donald Leon looked the
other way. I

Pitt’s present senior vice
president for health and sciences,
Dr. Thomas-Detre, took over as
interim medical school dean when
Leon left and insisted that each of
the school’s practice plans submit
a detailed account of how much
each individual department and
individual physician was
earning through the salary
bonuses. . '

Jegasothy said.

According to The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, University of

Executive Vice President Jeffrey .
Romoff said, “Were there abuses
in the past? Yes. Will there be

would be a complete distortion

not note that there were 700
other physicians who were doing

earning exactly what they were
supposed to day in and day
out.”

It is unclear exactly how many
physicians‘ may have broken
the rules on -practice-plan
income, the Post-Gazette re-
ported.

“There are also safeguards

them, but not everyone does. Not
everyone who does not notice

Pitt researcher to study.

sleep patterns for NASA

By Robyn Petrella
For T be Piu News

Some people ﬁnd it difficult to sleep lying down in bed, let
alone standing up. But for the four. astronauts scheduled for the
1994 mission aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, this is a regular‘
problem.

So researchers at NASA decided to study the biological clock

associated with sleep.

Pitt researcher Dr. Timothy Monk has been working for the
last..l8 months, developing a series of tests aimed at the study
of sleep disorderswith astronauts. '

The procedures studied will be used in a 1994 space—shuttle
flight. Monk explained that the study will include a number of
different tests. C

One will be the use of electrodes on the astronauts’ heads
during different intervals of the trip.

The information will be recorded on each astronaut twice at
the beginning, middle and end of the journey. This test, which
is similar to a polygraph test, will enable researchers to study the
various sleep patterns.

The measurement block test is another sleep test that studies
the circadian sleep rhythms in the body by measuring the body
temperature.

Each astronaut will be asked to swallow a “radio” pill that

measures the body temperature from a box in the shuttle and 

then records the data;
In addition, a urine—monitor system will. be used as a
supplement to measure body temperature.

Next year’s RSA to go tbro

By Donna Pesansky
Sta_[fWr1'ter‘

The Resident Student Assoc-
iation will try to rebuild its
organization next year, according
to new RSA President Dina
Scardamalia.

“I have a lot of good ideas, and
by starting from scratch I hope to
make a backbone for RSA that
will be around a long time after
I’m gone,” Scardamalia said.

RSA’s goals are to “throw out
the old constitution, form a strong
foundation from the beginning,
make people know we exist and

make members feel it is an honor

to be a part of RSA,” Scardamalia
said at an induction banquet for
new officers last night.

“There were a lot of problems
last year: Officers left, and the
chief advisor resigned his
position,” said Jon Conlogue,
current advisor to the RSA, “but
this year’s board is ready to work
hard and is very dedicated.”

Along with Scardamalia,
Michael Matrick was inducted as
vice president, Janinne Markizon
as treasurer, Joseph DeSuto as
secretary, David Cocaianni as the
publicity director and David Petras

COUGH STUDY
Children's Hospital

The ENT Department is conducting a
study of coughing in adult (>18yrs)
patients with recent onset coughs (8-48
hrs). One hundred healthy adult patients
with cough due to a cold will be studied.
On the afternoon before the study, the
potential subjects will report to Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh for a physical
examination. ‘On the following morning
the enrolled patients will remain in their
home for 24 hours and wear a microphone
which broadcasts cough sounds to a tape
recorder. During that period, patients will
take a test medication and must remain -in .

their homes, but are otherwise ‘
unrestricted in their activities‘. Patients .
will be reimbursed atotal of $200.00 for
0 completing the study. For more
information call Children’s Hospital at

as national communication
coordinator.

“The RSA has a substantial
budget and can accomplish a
lot,” Scardamalia said. “We have
a good relationship with the Office
of Residence Life, and because of
that we can go on to do bigger
and better things.”

Markizon said she hopes to see
some changes from last year,
such as increased student
participation and greater
interaction with various campus
organizations.

“I hope by having programs
with the groups, such as the

Campus Women’s Organization,
the Black Action Society, the
Panhellenic Council and the
Student Government Board, we
can create a unified campus,”
Markizon said.

Petras, whose position was just
created for next year, said he is
planning to use ideas from other
universities.

“I really don’t know what is
expected of me, this being a
newly formed office,” Petras said,
“but I hope to talk to other
universities and colleges and find
out what programs worked best

Brutus pessimistic  
about South Africa

By John Brouder
For The Pitt News

South African anti-apartheid activist, poet and Pitt Professor
Dennis Brutus discussed what he called weaknesses in the
movement toward a freer societyin South Africa on Tuesday in
the Cathedral of Learning. '

While there is euphoria and optimism in South Africa, Brutus
said he has a pessimistic view for the immediate future.

“The assumption is that the Convention for a Democratic
South Africa will set a new constitution by the end of 1992, and
blacks will vote in 1993. The [apartheid] government will form
an alliance with some of the blacks but will still control the mass
of blacks,’’ he said.

“Although the future will bring a steady progress to abolition
of apartheid laws and the government will ultimately become

Sleep
Continued from page 3

The various complications
involving these tests will be
recorded in daily journals. The
astronauts will be working
different shifts that will affect
their sleeping habits, so the tests
will be focused on these
areas.

One reason why this is such a
big problem is that all the crew
members must be awake for the
takeoff and the landing of the
shuttle.

If their sleep is interrupted by
shifts, then their performance will
be affected.

As a result, these factors will

confuse the biological clock and _

interfere with their sleep. Monk
said that sleeping pills have been
used in the past but are not

recommended over a long period
of time.

Monk explained the sleep study
as a process aimed at three
different aspects of sleep. The
circadian rhythms, sleeping habits
and the biological clock must all
be considered interrelated in this
study.

Monk said he hopes to gain a
basic understanding of the sleep
limits our body can endure. The
biological clock is confused by a
lack ofsleep, and this will lead to
an inevitable breakdown of the
body, both physically and
mentally.

StAR survey presents numbers about racism at Pitt

By Rebecca Baker

I. I \ StajfW’riter

Results of a survey conducted by
Students Against Racism say that
discrimination exists at the University of
Pittsburgh.

“We have numbers that say we have a
problem with racism on campus,” said
StAR Presidentjoe Babinsack. Out of the
150 students that responded, 90 said that
they have seen racist graffiti on campus.
Other respondents said that they know of

many discriminatory incidents.

“The results are very unofficial,”
Babinsack said. “It’s not stuff we can act
upon. We made the survey vague so no
one feels like we’re pointing fingers.” ’

One question on the survey asked how
StAR could combat racism on campus.
While one student wrote “Show the
similarities between all people,” another

‘ student said, “[StARl can leave campus.”

Babinsack said he feels that some
students might think StAR is causing
problems with race on campus by simply

existing as a club.

Members discussed that too often in
crimes, an automatic question concerns
the races of the people involved-

A student commented that The Pitt News
did not mention the race of the man who
raped a woman near University Drive.

“There was no comment from her or
the police [about his race]. I assumed the
rapist must be white. I am a product of a
racist society,” he said.

“We want to create awareness of the
problem on campus,” Babinsack said.

“The people that learned the most from
this survey were the ones who have been
the victim and the perpetrator’ of
discrimination. This survey did not deal
solely with racism, but with all types of
discrimination.”

Members of StAR said they want to
continue to work on building membership
over the summer and for the next fall
semester.

“We want different voices,‘ participation,
involvement to expand awareness of StAR, ”
Babinsack said.

Summer program oﬂeredfor hyperactivity

By Vincent Gadrix
For T be Pm News

This summer the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center will be
offering an eight week chi|dren’s-
treatment program for children
suffering from /\ttention—l)eficit
Hyperactivity Disorder.

The program, which is in it’s
sixth year, provides treatment
tailored to each child’s behavioral,
emotional and learning
difficulties. Some of the
symptoms, which include being
easily distracted, ﬁdgeting with
hands and feet, difficulty waiting
for turns in games and excessive
talking, usually appear before
the age of 7.

The behavior of children with
ADHD may result in serious
disturbances in their relationships
with parents, teachers, peers and
siblings as well as academic

’v..o 1

problems. Two of the major
treatments include behavior
modiﬁcation or medication with
a psychostimularit drug, such as
methylphenidate, according to Dr.
William Pelham, associate
professor of psychiatry and
psychology at Pitt and director of
the ADHD program at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.
The summer program is not
only designed for children with
ADHD but also for their parents.
‘‘In behavioral therapy we teach
the child’s parents and teachers
how to restructure the
environment to shape the
appropriate behavior and
discourage them from doing the
things that they should not be
doing,” Pelham said. This
emphasizes helping thehparents
develop skills that will change
their child’s unacceptable
behavior at home, including non-

while ' improving the child’s

relationships with parents and

brothers and sisters.

“We have probably done more
work than anyone in the country
on ‘how to combine the
psychosocial approach with the
medication approach,” Pelham
said.

ADHD is one of the major
disorders of childhood. It is
present in 3 to 5 percent of the
elementary—schoo1 population.

I Although the cause of ADHD is

unknown, most professionals
believe the cause is based in the
brain. The exact nature of the
cause is unclear.

Over 400 children have -

participated in the summer

Ninety percent of the parents
said their children have shown
clear signs of improved behavior.

democratic with black votes, the number of killings will be on
the rise,” Brutus said.

He said there is an average of 40 murders a week in South
Africa. Brutus said reports of tribal killings in South Africa are

untrue. He claimed the government spends $200 million a year .

on black hit squads, whose violence is labeled as tribal.

Brutus said he was also skeptical of longer-term goals for an
upper and lower house in Congress. ‘ V

The upper house would be comprised of representatives
from various South African tribes and whites, while the lower
house would be comprised of any South African who wishes to
run in the election. V . , ‘

Brutus said he believes this system will not be productive
because the upper house will have the power to veto the lower
house’s legislation. ' ‘ "

Brutus also criticized the value—added tax which has been
imposed on coffee, sugar and other menial products. He said
this will have a dramatically negative impact on the poor.

Brutus said he fears that South Africa may break up into states,
with each state catering to white or black nationalism. Before
this happens/, Brutus said, a peacekeeping force from L the
United Nations should be installed in, South Africa.

Liberties defended

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court cast a now-rare 5-
4 vote in favor of curbing government law-enforcement
abuses. The Court overturned a federal, child pornography-
convictions ruling that the government overstepped
constitutional guarantees protecting citizens from
entrapment of law—enforcement agencies.

The case, Jacobson v. United States, involved a farmer
from Nebraska. Apparently, sometime in the early ’80s,
KeithJacobson, now 61, was on the mailing list of an adult
bookstore in California. With no criminal record, this

army veteran purchased erotic magazines featuring youths. .

At the time, the material was constitutionally protected.

Then in 1984 Congress passed legislation broadening
the definitions of pornography to include a wide variety
of material, including the type of erotica purchased by
Jacobson. -

Postal inspectors obtained Jacobson’s name from the
California store’s mailing list and began a crusade. Sending,
over a two—an=d-a—half-year period, surveys, pornography
order forms and solicitations to fight restrictive pornography
laws, postal agents coaxed Jacobson into purchasing
illegal pornography. One postal inspector even became
his “pen pal” for a time to encourage the purchase.

It is absolutely outrageous that the government spent
over two years enticing and manipulating this man into
purchasing illegal, sexually explicit magazines. Luckily,
the Supreme Court, in an unexpected move given its new
makeup, could not allow such a travesty of justice to
occur.

Justice White wrote: “In their zeal to enforce the law,
government agents may not originate a criminal design,
implant in an innocent person’s mind the disposition to
commit a criminal act and then induce commission of the
crime so that the government may prosecute.”

At his trial, White noted that Jacobson was asked why
he purchased the material. He responded that the
government action had succeeded in raising his curiosity.

Even more unconscionable, the behavior on behalf of
the postal agency would be illegal if done by a private
bookseller. For two and half years, the U.S. Postal Agency
tried to peddle illegal pornographic material.

In response, the Court’s dissenters claimed that the
government had a reasonable suspicion that Jacobson
was predisposed to break the law. They also argued that
the government's sting operations will be thwarted by the
majority’s opinion. Both claims are ridiculous.

Jacobson had.no criminal record. His only crime was
being on the wrong mailing list at the wrong time. Sting
operations will not be undermined by the ruling. Law-
enforcement officers can still function. However it is
unreasonable for federal agencies to randomly select a
citizen, enter his or her life and turn the person into a
criminal. .

With government agencies, hundreds of agents and
inspectors, thousands and thousands of dollars and
even”pen pals,” it is no surprise Jacobson was convicted.

This action is unwarranted in a supposedly free society.
Unfortunately, by a margin of one, the Supreme Court
could have let it occur. .

Democmtic oﬂermgs board to digest    

Students this election year may be thinking to
themselves, “Are these my only choices?”
Unfortunately, the answer is “yes.” ;

Jerry Brown and Bill Clinton are your options if
you are of the Democratic persuasion; Bush and
Buchanan are if you favor Republicans. Personally,
the idea of either Bush or Buchanan being elected
makes me sick, but I can’t see Clinton or Brown
taking over the White House, either.

The “choices” make me want

to attend the execution of a brain-damaged man. I

suppose that Clinton wanted to show everyone that

he is “tough on crime.”

I am morally opposed to capital punishment, but
even if I were a supporter I’d be turned off by
Clinton’s manipulation of an execution for political
points.

Speaking of manipulating issues, Jerry Brown is
the only real challenger left in the Democratic race.

country that doesn’t vote — but

The only problem I have with
Brown is that he is known for
flip-ﬂopping wildly on issues.
Contrary to mainstream pundits,

a walk through the cesspool that is American
politics.

Now this journey is only through the Democratic .

side of the stinkhole since I don’t have anything to
say about the Republican candidates that would be

— of any use to their supporters, except, perhaps, that

they should be publicly whipped. That said, let us
move on to Bill Clinton. . .

How did this guy become a frontrunner? His
demeanor strikes me as that of an aging, airheaded
frat guy, despite the fact that he is a Rhodes Scholar.
Middle of the road in hispolitics and in his
mannerisms, he is the ultimate white bread, suburban
candidate.

Maybe that is why the media referred to him as
the frontrunner even before the primaries began.
Everybody has an agenda, but it is hard to see
where the King of Bland’s appeal lies; '

Brown and Tsongas had it right when they
referred to his middle—class tax credit plan as
“pandering.” It has little use as anything else.
Maybe this is where Clinton’s appeal lies. He seems
like a go along-to—get along kind of fellow.
Unfortunately, this country needs a leader not a
blow-up doll.

Clinton has other problems. He has become a‘

magnet for scandal—of-the week stories. Last week
it was the notorious “puff on a joint” story that also
hounded Supreme Court nominees Douglas
Ginsberg and Clarence Thomas. Clinton and Thomas
played the story the smart way; they both used that

“I tried it, and I didn’t like it” response, ‘whereas A

Ginsberg didn’t indicate that he regretted his
experience at all.

Personally, I don’t care whether or not he ever
got high, and I suspect that most people don’t,
either. , '

What I ticks me off is his rush home to Arkansas

of California is pretty good, with 2,000 new jobs

saying that he would increase taxes, if necessary, ”

the American’ people aren't ready to face the reality
of a tax increase. That may cost him votes.

His image among Democrats isn’t good either.
He has been called irresponsible; he doesn’t seem
concerned about doing what is best for the
Democratic party.

This isn’t all together bad since he is campaigning
against both the Republican and Democratic political

establishment.’ He has been called hypercritical

has changed since then and feels that, as a former
insider, he is in the best position to critique the
political system. A

The problem is Brown changes a little too often.
The convictions he has today may completely
change tomorrow. That’s a little too risky for voters
who feel that government leaders haven't been
accountable enough to the people. V

Another big concern among Democrats is that he
may take votes away from Clinton, who is widely
regarded as the likely Democratic nominee.

So there we have it: our two choices —— one is a
candidate with mass appeal, who doesn’t seem
capable of effecting any real change or avoiding
scandal; the other is a wacky humanitarian, whose
stance on issues shifts to the right or the left,
according to the way the winds blow.

Is there room on the ballot for “none of the
above?” H

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 8, 1992

 

Misguided busybodies ignore teenage sex drives

School districts nationwide are debating
making condoms available for hi gh-school
students. As usual there is an enormous
debate and much hooplah from the
misguided.

There is a concern that the schools
appear to condone teenage sexual
activity.

This culture has practically made sex a
-rite of passage for teens Most high-school
students are already in a social situation
where sexual activity is either condoned
or expected. Teenagers haven’t ever
seemed very concerned about parental
consent and certainly not about the consent
of teachers.

In my charting of every possible inane
statement imaginable, the following
sentences hold a special place: “I am
opposed to having condoms available in
high schools;” “The kids would see sex

' education in the schools as condoning

their having sex” and “First there was sex
education; now they want condoms. What’s

next?”
I just don’t imagine high-school students
saying to each other, “I can't have sex with

to joke about.
At best, making condoms available will
create an atmosphere in which people

you because the

who are allegedly

school doesnrt becoming adults
condone it” or “Oh,  have no excuses for
God_ Rob just beingirresponsible;
bought a new  Like it OFTIOK.
condom. He was - teenagers are

sort of a dork
before, but now  ooohh.”

High-school students are moke likely
nervous or unwilling to go to the drug
store for condoms and rationalize not
using protection. ,

Anyone who is truly worried that their
child is going to say something like, “Oh,
wow! The school is providing condoms.
Like, now I can get laid!” needs to get in
touch with their child. Having condoms
available isn’t going to lead teenagers into
some new, sexually liberated age.

Having condoms available, at worst, is
going to provide students with new material

developing atti-
tudes about sexual practices that will last
a lifetime.

' If parents want to discuss responsible
sex‘ with their kids, they should get to
them before they start looking for condoms
in the first place.

Once teenagers reach the point where
they need to be informed, parents should
be happy that anyone accountable to their
children would be willing to provide sexual
information.

Expecting teenagers to stop talking
about, thinking about or having sex is not
realistic. Providing assistance in making

sound decisions and removing excuses
for making poor decisions are preferable
to ignorance.

AIDS is here. AIDS kills. AIDS is showing
up in schools.

Although abstinence or masturbation is
the only way to be 100—percent safe, I
suspect that for a lot of teens, the fear of

pregnancy is more real.

Even this fear has not caused abstinence
to be popular among teenagers. If school
boards want to protect the young people,
they will provide condoms at cost through
a high school’s physician or health-
education instructors.

I imagine that it would be nice to live in
a society where the welfare of young
people can be insured by chanting mantras
like “Just say no!”

I just don’t think that that kind of society
has ever existed.

Difficulties for smokers

The most recent member to join the “Do—It-For-Me” club has
surfacedover the past year. It’s name is the nicotine patch, and
its purpose is to help people quit smoking. The patch requires
no effort, and its demand is skyrocketing. Surprise, surprise.

A cover story written by Gary Strauss in the April 2 U.S.A. Today
described the procedure.

“Patches are applied every 24 hours on the upper arm, back

Tim Desmond

or chest and are worn for up to 12 weeks. Physicians prescribe
Nicoderm and Habitrol in initial four— to six—week dosages that
provide nicotine levels equivalent to a pack of cigarettes a day.
Smokers are then weaned on a second patch, containing a third
less nicotine, (followed by’ a three-week dose that reduces
nicotine by another third.”

This patch might work in the same way that the Cosby’s solve
their problems: in theory ‘only. It is not that this procedure
would not be effective, but it is only winning the battle and not
the war. ’

George Lesmes, a cardiologist at Northeastern University, is
conducting a study with smokers and the patch. He warns, "The
great thing about the patch is that it mirrors the physical,
addictive effects of nicotine, but you have to deal with the
powerful psychological aspects of smoking.”

The patch may help the body recover, but it does nothing for
the psychological effects. Once again, the media has portrayed
this patch as the magic cure-all for cigarette smokers. There is
not much in life that one does not have to work for. I believe
most people would agree.

The mentality behind the patch is not a new one, nor is it
obscure. Take, for example, liposuction. Instead of attempting
to work off excess weight by proper diet and exercising, these
poor, grudging souls ask a surgeon to suck fat out of their body
like a shop vacuum. _

It is human nature to do the smallest amount of work possible
to accomplish a task. I am just as guilty as anyone else. For
instance, I have reduced margins on term papers to cover the
5-10 page minimum. This lessens work already completed but
does not substitute for the entire piece of work.

Another example of this lazy mentality is “milkshake dieters.”
Think how easy companies make it sound: “Just three delicious
glasses of brown-colored water a day and in no time you will
be posing on the cover of the next Muscle (3 Fitness issue.”

A Pretending that by slurping ﬂuids and watching television on

your couch all day, you will drop an extra 100 pounds of flesh
, is foolish. '

While the nicotine patch may be a step in the right direction,
people will use it as the only method to quit smoking. In George
Lesmes’ words, “People are always looking for the quick fix,
and the patch isn’t a quick fix.”

The bottom line in this issue is laziness. People expect
miracles to happen without ever lifting a finger. This logic leads
to few results in any attempt at change. _

Milk and cookies go to the nicotine patch and milkshake
companies for meeting us halfway. Now grab that remote
control, turn the television off and start helping yourself.
Americans are lazy, and I am sure that I have heard this
elsewhere. .

Speaker’s message misunderstood

I am writing this letter in
response to an article written on
3/ 1/92 about the presentation that
was given by Dr. James Huggins
addressing the topic of
“Homophobia.”

I was present at this event and
was shocked when I read the
write-up in ThePitt News the next
day. When I first read the article,
I had really hoped it was an April
Fool’s joke; unfortunately it was
not.

Firstly, the presenter was Dr.
James Huggins, who is a trained

' psychologist and also co-founder
of the. PERSAD center. Those’

readers who do not know ‘what
the PERSAD center is, let me fill
you in because the staff writer for
The Pitt News made it look like a
nuthouse.'

PERSAD is a professional
agency Downtown that deals with
the supportand counseling for gay
men, lesbians, bisexuals, AIDS
victims and their families. ThePitt
News only mentioned that
PERSAD offers “therapy” for
people of alternative lifestyles —
almost drawing the conclusion
that people who choose non-
heterosexual lifestyles are in need
of psychological treatment. OK,
now that that’s cleared up, let's
move on.

The whole purpose of Dr.
Huggins’ discussion was to
provide an open and honest arena
for all people of all lifestyles to
ask questions about
homosexuality.

Not once was this mentioned
in the article.

During the evening, Dr.
Huggins was able to sincerely
answer questions on why he is
gay and what made him
uncomfortable about that fact
while growing up in Wheeling,

W.Va. (a very homophobic area
in the early 705).

What was written in The Pitt
News portrayed Dr. Huggins as a
cheesy, gay, male whore who
preyed on other men in bar
bathrooms. In actuality, Dr.
Huggins is a highly trained
professional. who cares enough
to help dispel the myths and
preconceived notions that people
have about being gay...

Lastly, it was never mentioned

. Letters

who sponsored this important
event — the Office of Residence
Life and the Schenley Quad
Resident Assistants. When
covering important events such
as this one, The Pitt News should
recognize the efforts of those
who make the program
possible.... -

Campus virginity “probed”

Ed Kichline’s article entitled
“University virgins few and far
between,” printed on April 2, is
not only the most insigniﬁcant
piece of journalism (if you can
call it that) I have come across in
recent memory, it is also the most
ignorant. I

He speaks of the virgin as an
outcast to society — a leper, if
you will. ,

He claims the only way these
“virgins” have a chance of making
it is somehow rummaging through
the college campus searching for
fellow virgins to gather and
coexist with. I would expect Mr.
Kichline would want the virgin to

carry an identification card or
bracelet to let others know they
are a virgin, thus saving time in
the dating process.
Furthermore,4I would like to
know how Mr. Kichline knows
so much about the virgin mentality
with such probing (no pun
intended) insights l. . .l as “A virgin
must search high and‘low to find
another virgin.”
_ It is overwhelmingly apparent
[that] Mr. Kichline has never been
in a loving, nurturing relationship,
requiring much more than sex.
What bothered. me the most about

this article, not to mention ThePitt ,

News and university community
on the whole, is the complete
lack of mention of the HIV and
AIDS crisis....

A college campus is a cesspool
for disease and infection. All too
often we think of ourselves as
infallible and almighty.
Unfortunately, the facts speak for
themselves: One in 45 persons
randomly screened in the
Oakland area and one in 100
males nationally were found to
be HIV positive.

Most of them don’t even know
it. So for Mr. Kichline to say,
“Unless a teenager hasa friend
who has been pregnant or who
has impregnated someone, there
is no sense of danger about having
sex, is
uneducated and misguided!

My point is simple: It’s time we
wake up to the AIDS epidemic
here on campus (yes, there is
one), and certainly not poke fun
at the virgin, when the self-
restrained and the monogamous
may be the only ones truly
“pure.”

The fourth annual “Ultimate

weekend at Trees Hall, and it
held true to form. It was once
again a smashing success.

The crowds on hand for all
three events-—— weightlifting, arm

treated to an incredible exhibition
of skill, strength and endurance.

A jam-packed Trees Hall gym
also saw, Pitt student and
Pennsylvania State Karate
Champion Dan Granger finish in
third place  in a higher weight
division.

On the day of the event, the
intercom system in Trees Gym
was not working properly, so
Granger did not hear the ﬁnal call
for participants in his weight class,
the lightweight division. As a
result of the mixup, he was forced
to compete in the middleweight
division.

Surprisingly enough, Granger

(First of a twogpart series)
What does it really take to be a varsity sport at a

s’Division I university? Well, 450 athletes at Pitt know

what it feels like. At the present moment Pitt has 19
varsity sports, 11 men’s and eight women’s teams.
' These have been the 19 stable sports at Pitt since
the late ’70s. ,

According to Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes,
over the last 18'to 20 years three men’s sports and
one women’s sport have been -discontinued.In
men’s sports Pitt dropped water polo, golf and
men’s volleyball, while field hockey has been the
only women’s sport that has gone the way of the
sabre—toothed tiger.

Several factors go into the discontinuation and

Qthe maintenance of a sport, but four of the major

ones are funding, interest, facilities and competition.
Although four reasons add to the demise and
continuation of a sport, the former is more prevalent
than the latter. _

Every time one turns around, money seems to hit
it smack dab in the face.

According to jaynes, there are two areas in Pitt’s
athletic department ‘that have increased
tremendously in the last 10 years: health_care and
the cost of education. ’

When jaynes speaks ofthe cost of education, he
is not speaking of the cost it takes Pitt to continue
to educate students, but the actual cost it takesto
go to school at Pitt. '

“We are looking at a ‘6-percent increase in that_

this year,” jaynes said. “You are worriedabout one

tuition—cost increase of $257.40. Now multiply that
times the numberof athletes we have — by
scholarship bill or the department bill for our

scholarship program —+ that goes up times the

number of scholarships we have.” _

According to Jaynes, the athletic department’s
scholarship budget is now approaching $2 million.
Once the expected 6-percent increase is added to
the scholarship total, the department looks toward
food _and housing for its athletes. ‘

“With food, housing and tuition [...l, if it averages
going up 5,6,7 percent,” Jaynes said. “Now our bill
is going up $100-150 thousand a year. That is a
significant increase. It’s a lot more than $100—250 [to
individual studentsl.” ‘

On of Pitt’s largest contributors to the scholarship
program is the number of athletic endowment
scholarships, which the department draws upon to
educate its athletes. The revenue on endowments
is going down because the interest rates are going
down.

In a _$100,000 endowment scholarship that is
earning 10 percent, the return is $10,000, which
pretty much covers the scholarship. Yet now, with
the decrease in interest rates, that same $100,000
maybe will earn 5-percent interest. Now you only
have $5,000 return to spend on that particular
scholarship, where at 10 percent you’d have had
$10,000. 5

“Our endowment scholarships have gone down

. about 2.5-3 percent for this year,” Jaynes said, “and

that is a loss of revenue, so your monies go down

on the endowment that you have.” /
There are a few private schools across the nation

this summer, or would David

committee OK-ed, pro basketball
players for the summer games,
they forced the American public

more important than potential
greatness.

The United States has always
been considered the premiere
basketball country in the world.
The U.S. exports tons of players
to Italy, England, Australia and
Germany to stock their leagues
with talent. Most _of the guys that

an even field (or court, in this
case) for the first time. The old
saying, “When in Rome, do as the
Romans do," applies here. This
summer in Barcelona every team
the U.S. will face is 100-percent
professional.

These squads have been
playing together for years — a
factor that simply cannot be

- underestimated. Regardless of

whether the U.S. sends its

amateurs or pros, the fact remains

that we are at a disadvantage in
this aspect.

Chuck Daly will have to mesh
his club in three or four weeks —
not a desirable situation. But the
pro squad will have no problem
blending together and
complementing their talents.They
are seasoned warhorses who have
made no bones about their
intentions.

Anyone who subscribes to the
theory that “There won’t be
enough basketballs on the floor”
doesn’t consider the
character, much less the overall
court sense, of the club we’re
sending.

Talk about the glory of 1984 all
you want, but that was the end as
far as a U.S. amateur-squad
domination.

Patrick Ewing, Chris Mullin,
Michael Jordan and Wayman
Tisdale were hellbent on
destroying any team they met
and were nothing less than
spectacular. _

But reality tells us those days
are gone forever. The 1986
Goodwill Games was the last
time an American team came
home with gold._So the theory
that we could do just as well
sending our collegians holds no
water. '

All that would do is leave the
door open for another shameful
performance.

It’s really easy to say, “Throw
O’Neal, Christian Laettner, Alonzo
Mourning,JimmyJackson, Byron
Houston, etc. on the floor, and
the U.S. can still win.” This isn’t
about rah—rah, let's go cheer for
our college boys and make it
more competitive. Nobody would
consider them an underdog
anyway.

The talk in Spain would be,
“Who’s gonna beat up the big,
bully Americans this time?” The
U.S. would be underachievers
and chokers if they failed to win
again.

Besides, the chances of sending
our best collegians are slim to
none.

Every time trial camps are held,
some college players are
recuperating from nagging
injuries.

Many don’t want to risk their
long-term pro value due to an
injury, and others will inevitably
have a personality conflict with
the coach.

That '90 Goodwill team was at
such a disadvantage, missing four

legitimate superstars. O’Neal,,

Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon
and Steve.Smith didn’t eventry
out. '

All four were unanimous or
consensus first-team All-
Americans. Not even Mike
Krzyzewski could win with the
college players he had on that
team.

Inevitably, selecting from
collegians falls into the trap of
politics. Coaches take their own
players and stubbornly force feed
their own system to players not
compatible with it. '

In ’84 Bob Knight left Charles
Barkley and Karl Malone off the
club and chose first—year Hoosier
Steve Alford instead.

Obviously, Knight didn’t like
the styles of Sir Charles and the

Mailman and didn’t want to adapt _

to their superior talent in any
way.

Fortunately, that ’84 club was
impossible to mess up. In ’88
John Thompson selected his own
Charles Smith, Virginia Tech’s
Bimbo Coles and Augmon, then
a raw, first-year player with an
extremely limited offensive game,

strictly for defensive purposes.
Too bad Thompson forget about
offense, something sort of
necessary to win. Last time I
checked, they keep score with
points.

Thompson had nobody other
than Hersey Hawkins that could
shoot the ball.When Hawkins was
limited by nagging injuries, David
Robinson and company looked
stale and ultimately fell to the
Soviets in the semifinals — an
embarrassment to the entire
nation.

The failures .of the ’87 Pan
American team, the ’88 Olympic
club, the '90 Goodwill Games
team and finally the '91 Pan Am
club forced the hand of U.S.
Basketball Committee President
Dave Gavitt.

He has assembled an elite staff

- of Daly, assistants Lenny Wilkens,

Mike Krzyzewski and P.J.
Carlesimo. The main job of these
four gentlemen will be motivating
early on.

They are just the exact blend of
personalities who can go out and
“kick some tail,” if necessary.
They won’t have any trouble
focusing this squad once the
planes are boarded for
Barcelona.

It’s time to show the world
who’s boss, and who better to do
that than Barkley and Malone?

They'll have a little help from

Jordan, Ewing, Mullin, Robinson,
John Stockton, Larry Bird, Scottie
Pippen and, possibly, Magic
Johnson.

 

There are two or three spots ,.,

available to fill out the roster, and
boy, I feel for Daly and his staff.
They only have scrubs like Tim
Hardaway, Clyde Drexler, Dennis
Rodman, Mark Price,Joe Dumars,

. Isaiah Thomas, Kevin Johnson,

O’Neal, Laettner and Jackson to
choose from. .

What the 1992 Olympic Games
will offer the entire world is the
opportunity to see the greatest
basketball team ever, no question
about it.

These guys are the best athletes
in the universe, and watching
them on the same ﬂoor together
will be sheer bliss for any hoop
fan.

Even if you don’t particularly”

enjoy basketball, check out
Malone and Barkley filling the
lanes on the break, throwing
down thunderdunks while
Stockton orchestrates.

Mullin will give new meaning
to “sniper” with the international
three—point line at only 21 feet.

Thompson, led the '88 brigade to
a disappointing bronze medal at
Seoul. Thompson took a lotof
well-deserved heat from the press
for not including any shooters on
his roster. But if people took the
time to look back at what
happened, they’ll see that the
team collapsed when the Bradley
University shooting phenom,
Hersey Hawkins, went down in
the early rounds. With Hawkins
in the lineup, guys like Mannirig,
Robinson, Augmon andJ.R. Reid
could have gotten off a little
easier in the post.

Instead of crying about the
third—place finish, the committee
should have considered the
achievements of Bobby Knight’s
’8/i thoroughbreds. Indiana
sharpshooter Steve Alford; North

T rack.  

Continued from page 11
he was pleased with the results.
“Everybody still responded
[despite the coldl.”

Pitt had two more lC4A. '

qualifiers as Jim Monk placed
third in the discus at 144 feet and
Tom Swartout placed third in the
5,000 steeplechase at9:08.2. Mike
Umbley placed third in the 1,500
meters at 4:03.9.In the distance-
medley championships the
Panthers placed ninth at 1029,

but Pitt finished first in the shuttle-
hurdle relays with a team ofChris
Douglas, Alexander, Shields and
Jobson in a time of 59:12.

Pitt travels to the University of
Tennessee for the Dogwood
Relays next weekend, which is
expected to bring a higher level
of competition.

“It’s a notch up. We’ve got to
be concerned with ourselves, not
what other schools are doing,”
Vasvary said.

Carolina’s living legend, Michael
Jordan; and St. John’s’ Chris
“White Men Can't Jump” Mullin
gave the ’84 team the Midas touch.
Knight’s discipline and strategies
guided those college players to
an easy gold medal.

The second reason the Olympic
committee is scampering to send
pros to Barcelona is that other
countries have been using pros
for years.

But the old “lfjimmy jumps off
the bridge” excuse should not
apply. Vlade Divac, Sarunas

Marciulionis, Alexandr Volkov-

and Bill Wennington all flew
home after the NBA season to
play on their countries’ Olympic
teams, none of which made a
severe impact.

A With the talent that lurks in the
college ranks this year, the U.S.
would have no problem waxing

the international competition.
This year’s crop could even use
Paul Evans as its head coach and
still walk away with the gold.

Some more pro quo for my
colleague, Rob Pugliese. What
country could hang with a front
line of Christian Laettner,
Shaquille O’Neal and Alonzo
Mourning?

Add Byron Houston and Don
MacLean off the bench, and give
Bobby Hurley and Harold Miner
the guard positions. UConn’s
Chris Smith, Ohio State's Jimmy
Jackson, Maryland’s Walt
Williams, Seton Hall’s Terry
Dehere and Virginia’s Bryant Stith
are just a few of the reserves.
Don't forget one-man gang
Anthony Peeler and scrappy hoop
hounds Jon Barry, Rex Walters
and Damon Bailey.The "pond is

you could ﬁeld a second team
coached by Norm Law and still
win.

We’ll never know the
excitement that could have been
this summer in Barcelona. There
won’t be any cheering for the
underdog, no looking back three
or four years from now wondering
how their careers have
progressed. We’ll be turning off
the TV by the end of every first
half, saying to ourselves, “I’ve
seen enough fast breaks, 3 on 15,
25-foot jump shots and 360 slams
to last a lifetime!”

Remember how it felt to run
home after class and find out if
the U.S. Hockey Team had won
or lost? Well, you better put that
feeling on the shelfuntil the next
winter games. In the meantime,
remember how General Custer
felt at Little Big llorn.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, April 8, 1992

 

Varsity

Continued from page 11
that are feeling the pinch of the
low interest rates, for example
the Duke Foundation. (Its whole
program is endowed.) If you were
also to look at Harvard, Yale and
Stanford, they're also funded
through endowments. With the
interest rates going down, they
are hurting bad.

They depend a great deal upon
the interest from their
endowments to help pay for the
cost of education.

When those interest rates go
down, the amount of money they
have to spend on those
endowments increases.

According to Jaynes, when
endowment scholarships are hit
as bad as they have been, the
money that they once supplied
has to come from somewhere
else.

If Pitt’s scholarship program
takes a $100,000 hit on the
endowment side of its
scholarships, that $100,000 has

got to be made up somewhere
else.

“You can only raise ticket prices
so much,” Jaynes said, “and
private funding right now is at a
low ebb.”

jaynes said he feels that the
reasons for lack of corporate
funding right now come down to
the way the state of the economy
has been effected.

One of jaynes’ key examples is
the steel industry here in the
Pittsburgh area and how it has
gone down for the last 10 years.
jaynes also emphasized the type
of hit that Westinghouse and
General Motors took this Year.
Westinghouse cut back on 400
jobs, while GM closed plants,
affecting 12-14,000 workers.

When the state ofthe economy
is effected in such a manner, it
affects Pitt’s ability to raise private
funds through its scholarship
programs.

Pitt’s scholarship program is
one of the key areas that holds a

Ultimate

Continued from page 11
380 competitors participated in
the tournaments, including
athletes from Pitt, Penn State,
WVU, Duquesne, Akron U. and
other nearby colleges.

The large gym at Trees Hall
was filled to capacity for nearly
every event, and “Ultimate Force”
chief coordinator Curtis Smith
said he is considering trying to
move the event to Fitzgerald Field

House , which seats over
6,000,next year.

In addition to the many local
charities the “Ultimate Force”
continually supports, this year’s
festivities gave fantastic support
to the Special Olympics program.

Smith said several Pitt students
helped in the preparation of the
event, and their help was critical
to the success of this year’s
extravaganza.

For us to add additional sports in our
program without adding scholarships
at our level makes no [sense]. It’s hard to
make a case for that because now you
are competing against teams with

funding.

—Athletic Director Ovaljaynes

sport from gaining varsity
status.

Pitt’s lacrosse club petitioned
the university two years ago for
varsity status. The club’s petition
was denied, and lacrosse
remained at club status.

With the state of the economy
right now, Jaynes said that he
feels it would be against Pitt’s
best interest to add a new sport to
the 19 that the athletic department
now supports.

“For us to add additional sports
in our program without adding

’ scholarships at our level makes

no lsense],”Jaynes said. “It’s hard
to make a case for that because
now you are competing against
teams with funding.”

Jaynes used lacrosse as an
example of what would happen
if it were added to Pitt’s program.
According to Jaynes, to add
lacrosse here and for it to be
competitive with the teams Pitt

would compete against, the
athletic department would have
to put money into the sport. The
club members said that they do
not want any scholarships.

Jaynes said he doesn’t feel that
is how a varsity sport is to be .run
at Pitt. “Well, it don’t work that
way,” he said. “When you become
a part of the program, all of the
sudden you are representing the
University of Pittsburgh, and you
go and you get embarrassed
because you can’t compete
because you don’t have
scholarship dollars. The next push
is to put money into it.”

The next step that Pitt would
have to take would be to put
about 12-14 scholarships into
lacrosse.Now multiply that
number by the cost of education
at Pitt, and say that half of those
students are out of state (which

means about $14—$1S,O00 per A
scholarship, depending upon’

what school they are enrolled
in).

Next thing you know, you have
anywhere from $100—$175,000 in
a scholarship budget.

“Who’s going to pay that
money?” Jaynes asked. “I mean,
how many more [sportsl are you
going to put on football and
men’s basketball, because they
generate nearly 90 percent of
the revenue in our sports
program.”

Injaynes’ opinion, the addition
of another sport or to spend
another quarter of a million dollars
on a sport that would generate
no revenue would be a big
mistake.

Jaynes also said there is a push ,

across the country to try to get the
non~revenue sports programs to
be self—supporting.

“We get some assistance from
the university here to add a
program,” Jaynes said. “That
assistance [is] to offset the cost of
having our women’s programs
and our varsity programs.

Jaynes said that the practice is
common for 70—75 percent of
Division I universities across the
country.

There are very few schools that
are self—supporting.

In Jaynes’ opinion, the money
that is provided by the university
helps to provide a broad—based
program for the students, so they
can compete in track, wrestling,
gymnastics and swimming. Those
sports generate little revenue.
