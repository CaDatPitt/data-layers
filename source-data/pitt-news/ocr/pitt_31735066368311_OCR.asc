The winter rush’ period for Pitt's
fraternities has been shortened by a
week this year in order to ease the
strain on fraternity expenses and
neighbor relations, according to
Pitt Interfraternitv Council (IFC)
president Greg Wilson.

“A fraternity can ‘save two or
three hundred dollars in the shor-

the IFC rules and they let us know
about it if one is being broken."

Wilson said he believes that fra-
ternities should be responsible for

‘ maintaining order at their own

parties and that incidents like the
large-scale brawl that broke out at
Zeta Beta Tau fraternity last fall
can be avoided; On that occasion
both campus and Pittsburgh police
were called to the Bayard Street fra-
ternity, and a few students were
treated by city paramedics for
minor injuries.

tened rush period," Wilson said;

In addition to saving the frater-
nities money, Wilson said he hopes
that a shortened rush will help to
reduce the tension that exists
between fraternities and their
neighbors.

“The neighbors complain if they ‘
hear noise after one o'clock on the -
weekends or if someone is playing
a stereo too loud during the week,”
Wilson, said. .‘‘_They. have copies of

“The director of student activi-
ties (Andy Smith) ‘is pressuring
Greeks to police themselves,” Wil-
son said. “Last fall, the presidents
of all the houses were informed
that if something like that (the
Bayard Street fight) were to happen
again, their fraternities would face
fines and possible socialprobation.

“If that doesn’t work, we may
have to send IFC representatives to

allgthe‘ parties,” he said. '

.«-..

According to Wilson, the rela-
tionship between fraternities-and
their neighbors is improving
because all are more aware of
potential problems.

The IFC is continuing the policy
begun last fall of not selling rush
cards to juniors and seniors. Wil-
son admits that they have not been
as successful in restricting the sales
in the Winter Term as they had
been in the Fall.

“Last fall, we hadla computer
printout of everyone who had more
than 60 credits. This winter, we
weren't able to get one,” Wilson
said.

cards to freshmen and sophomores,

Iraqi Group

Meets
PeacefuHy

A meeting of the_Islamic_Union
of Iraqi Students was pulled “off
without incident Friday night in
Forbes Quadrangle.

Scores of uniformed and plain-
clothed campus police officers
were on hand to make sure that no
violence erupted as it did. during
the meeting on Nov. 20 of last year.

The group held meetings on
both Friday and Nov. 20 to protest
the present Iraqi government’ led
by Saddam Hussein. On Nov. 20, a
group of Hussein supporters
blocked the doors to the lecture hall
and began. battling with Islamic
Union members. Two men were
injured and two were arrested in
that incident.

Following the clash, a represen-
tative of the Islamic Union said
that the pro-Hussein group con-

sisted of people flown into Pitts- A

burgh to try and break up the
meeting. He said they were flown
in by the Iraqi government.

Pitt political science professor
and Middle East expert Richard
Cottam said that claim could have
been true because of past incidents

in other parts of the country and in‘

Pittsburgh’. ~ _ «

Rushshortened a Week to Save Money  

the IFC hopes to improvethe qual- '

ity of rush, since freshmen and
sophomores are more likely to
pledge a fraternity, Wilson said,

Sohfar this winter fraternity rush O

has gone off without a hitch, Wil-
son said. By Friday afternoon, the
IFC had sold about 126 rush cards,
which is about average.

Wilson said that “the nation-
wide popularity of fraternities
seems to be increasing. .

“The parties this weekend were
well attended" and I think that we
will have a good winter rush,” he
said. ‘fThe'trend for the last couple
of years has been for larger pledge

,classes, and I see that trend
continuing."

More money will be available
for students attending Pennsyl-
vania colleges and universities
thanks to legislation that was
signed into law by Gov. Dick
Thornburgh.

The legislation, H.B. 1578,
will authorize the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
Agency (PHEAA) to sell up to
$300 million in state bonds
annually to help finance col-
lege loans. t

“This administration has
been committed to ensuing that

tioii are given every opportuni-
ty available to , fulfill that.

, Grant,

A US.‘ appeals court has ruled
that the federal governmentcannot

cut off financial aid to students at

Hillsdale College simply because
the institution has refused to prom-
ise it won’t discriminate against
women.

In a 2-to-l decision, the US.‘
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir-
cuit rejected Hillsdale’s claim that
It is‘ not a recipient of federal aid.
But the court said the college was
subject to Title IX regulations only
on programs that actually get
government money.

The decision conflicts with a rul-
ing last summer by another federal
appellate court. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled
that Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, the federal
law prohibiting sex bias in educa-
tion, applies to an entire college
even when the institution receives
no federal support except through
student aid. The defendant in that
‘case, Grove «City College, has
appealed the decision- -to the
Supreme Court‘. The education
department has not yet decided
whether to appeal the Hillsdale
decision, a spokesman said.

The Hillsdale ruling makes it
more likely that the Supreme Court
will agree to decide the issues in the
Hillsdale and Grove City cases.

The Sixth Circuit’s decision rev-
ersed a 1979 order by the then
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare that sought to end fed-
eral financial —aid to students at
Hillsdale because officials at the
private institution had refused to
sign an “assurance of compliance”
with Title IX. '

Hillsdale’s refusal to sign the
assurance form was the only basis
for the government’s attempt to cut
off student financial aid.

There were no charges of actual
sex discrimination by the college.

Hillsdale officials contended
that promising to comply with
Title IX would subject the institu-
tion to government regulation and
impinge upon its independence
and autonomy. Since its founding
in 1844, Hillsdale has refused state
and federal aid, although individ-
ual students’ receive federal loans
under four programs—the
National Direct Student Loan, Pell
Supplementary Educa-
tional Opportunity and Guaran-
teed Student Loan programs.

Hillsdale claimed that because it
received no direct federal support it
should not be deemed a recipient of
federal financial assistance. The

‘court ruled that the college was a

CARING
  PEOPLE .

“recipient,” as defined in Title IX,.
and that its student-aid program
was subject to federal regulation
because the law is “program-
specific.”

Section 901 (a) of Title IX says,
“No person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex, be
excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be sub-
jected to discrimination under any
education program or activity
receiving federal financial
assistance.”

Exactly what constitutes an
“education ,.,program-”\is at the
heart of the controversy in the
Hillsdale and Grove City cases.

In the latter case, theIU'.S. Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit
rules that the entire college was a
“program” and, because its stu-
dents are recipients of federal loans
that ultimately benefit the institu-

I tion, the government could require

it to prove its compliance with
Title IX.

The Sixth Circuit interpreted
Title IX differently, saying that

Hillsdale, “as an institution, is not '
a ‘program’ within the meaning of .

Title IX and that the ‘program’
here is the student loan and grant
program. '

“Thus we agree,” the court said, '

“that only the student loan and
grant program is subject to Title
IX regulation.”

_ The court also agreed with Hills-
dale’s contention that the regula-
tion requiring it to promise to
comply with Title IX as a condi-
tion for its students to continue
receiving federal loans was invalid
because the regulation, as inter-
preted and applies by the govern-
ment, covered the entire college
and was not limited to the federal
loan programs. '

Besides ruling that Hillsdale is a
recipient of federal aid, the court
also sided with the government by
ruling that federal funds could be
cut off without a finding that an
institution had actually discrimi-
nated on the basis of sex.

Title IX provides that com-
pliance with the regulations can be
enforced by cutting off funds, but
does not provide that funds can be
eliminated only upon a finding of
actual discrimination, the court
said. .

Failing
Mid-Terms

President Reagan is steering this ship of
State around in circles, and after two years
of his administration, many Americans are
becoming seasick. . . -

Reagan came into office equipped, he
said, with a mandate from the people to
straighten out the sorry state .of things left
-by his predecessor. His plans toward this
end, however, have not been completely

. successful. Those concerned with American
education can count their blessings.

The Reagan Administration tried to get
rid of the Department of Education and
replace it with a structure that has fewer ‘
regulatory powers; in short, to abolish the
department. It didn’t. The department still’
exists, waiting for Reagan to submita prop-

’ osal to Congress.

The administration tried to eliminate
Pell grants and drastically reduce other
forms of student aid. National Direct Stu-
dent Loans (N DSL) have been cut by over
35 percent, but not denied any new funds, as
the administration intended.

Arts andhumanities funds weren’t cut by
the extreme percentages that the public was
led to expect, but instead byionly about 20
percent. .

Students are barred from receiving Social

’ Security student benefits, as promised, but
many students were able to enroll in college

early, and so to lock into some,'though_
gradually decreasing, benefits. 2

The situation really could be worse.

Reagan has tried to accomplish many of
the goals he had formulated to reduce the
waste in higher education. At mid-term, he
is failing miserably. Students, for one,
should consider themselves lucky that he
hasn’t kept all his promises.

But again, it’s only mid-term. There are
still the finals. *

...Retreating in 1983

By RON BARBER

A funny rumor circulated last
week. that there were strong
leaders on the Student Govern-
ment Board. The board has
taken swift action to crush that
rumor by announcing that its
first official act will be to
retreat. This symbolic back-
ward march in the careful use of
your student activities fee will
take -the board to the Airport
Holiday Inn in Monroeville.
That is, unless strong leader-

’ ship should prevail.

Self-indulgence on the part of
student government officers is,
of course, nothing new. We
have been picking up the tab for
expense-paid trips and catered
banquets since the institution

9 of the student activities fee. One
SGB standing committee chair-
man explained to me that,
because her SGB salary for one
month amounted to more than .

year, she was unconcerned by
this lack of thrift. It wasn’t her
money they were throwing

around.

Now, another rumor is circu-
lating that at least one recently
installed SGB member has
entertained fantasies‘ of calling
for the cancellation of this
planned retreat. What a won-
derful chance this would give
some board member to embar-

rass cynical observers who, like .

myself, have recently leveled
criticisms against the board.
And what a chance to strength-
en the board itself.

One of the tasks facing this
year's board is to try to mini-
mize the impact on Pitt students
of a declining university
budget. The SGB will be in a
much stronger position to carry
out thisjob if it sets an example,
taking actions to cut the cost of
administering services without
cutting the services themselves.

Dear Penthouse Forum:

I am a senior at an elite univer-
sity on the south side of Chicago. I
must admit, I've never been a fan of
your Forum column. Up until
recently, I was convinced that all
the letters were phoney. But as I am
now forced to eat crow, .I'd like to
share an experience of mine with
your readers. ’

Last Saturday night I decided to
pass time by wandering around the
university library, browsing for

’ books on Byzantine culture. While
— walking in the stacks on the fourth

floor, I spotted two young women
sprawled at the base of the B239-
B568 bookshelf. The girls,‘who I’ll
call Candy and Seka, were not par-
ticularly good looki-ng—Candy is
one of the few women who wears a

goatee and Seka has the unsavory “

habit of sucking on the tip of her
nose—but even from a distance of
30 feet, I could not help feasting my
eyes on their well-formed intuitive
powers.‘

They were lying with their backs
to me, and their baggy chinos and
soiled flannel shirts revealed two
sets of lusciously firm Neo-

»Wittgensteinian ideological sys-

tems. As I snuck up behind them, I
noticed they were sharing a copy of
Stanley Cavell’s “Must We Mean
What We Say?” and from their ner-
vous giggles and heavy breathing, I
could tell they were turned on by
what they were reading.

“The skeptic,” Seka panted,
“has a particular philosophic view
which positions his worlds oddly,

‘whereas the ordinary language

critic makes use only of what any

unprejudiced man can see to be.’

straight truth.” I gasped when Seka
bared her epistemic conditionals,
but luckily, the girls were too
involved with each other to notice
my presence. '

“But this is partial,” Candy
breathed, “because it assumes that

the skeptic need not be counted-

among those who can see that their
words are in apparent conflict with
what is ordinarily said.” She was
denuding Seka of . her rhetorical
drapery_ and probing for her
ontology. _

By now I was in a frenzy of desire.
“The partiality of this idea shows
in two ways!” I blurted out, unable
to control myself. The girls,
stunned for a moment, turned and
actively sought my presence. They
opened their a_pophantics and I

entered the melee. “They assume
the skeptic is a less perfect master of
English than his critic,” I
continued.

“Oooh!” Seka moaned, “Your
peripetetic extension is so big!”

. rhythm of

Candy sat quietly for a second,
fondling my assertions and work-
ing herself toward some more pro-
found climax. “These concessions
seem forced, or empty,” she said,
dangling her compound proposi-
tions in my face.

Seka tended to her friend’s objec-
tions. “To prove this you must'

show that a master of English, who
knows everything you know, has
no real use for them." Iran my eyes

. and took it all in. "S

“In the philosophy which pro-
ceeds ordinary language,” Seka
groaned, “understanding from the
inside is methodologically

the argument. She

More Harm Than Good

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The death of Pitt football
player Todd Becker on Dec. 16
was a tragedy that will not be
easily forgotten by students and
administrators. Not only was it
on the minds of many as they
watched the Cotton Bowl on
New Year's Day, but it was also
a main topic of conversation
among students returning after
the holidays last week.

Now students who live in the
dorms will constantly be
reminded of his death because
of the recent moratorium
against parties that was
imposed by the Office of Resi-
dence Life. '

To many, it may seem as if
these students are being pun-
ished because of that freak
occurrence. Granted, Becker's
death, and the way he died, was
horrible, but to put a stop to all
parties until the alcohol task‘
force can come up with a solu-
tion to make the Board of Trus-
tees happy does not seem like
good psychology.

Many unanswered questions
surround the events which took
place that night. For one, how
did the hosts of that party sneak
kegs of beer past Brackenridge
security enabling them to throw
the unauthorized party?

I’m sure that party was not
the only unauthorized one that
was going on during the last
days of finals. '

“rules were made to be broken,”
and even the director of ORL,
Jo Ann Woodson, admits that
every policy is violated at one
time or another. So now we can

 

expect that the moratorium will
be broken by some in the dorms.
Only this violation may be
dangerous. ‘

Let's recreate the scene. A res-
ident in any given dorm is hav-
ing a party even though there is
a moratorium against them.
Around midnight, word starts
circulating around the room
that dorm security, maybe even
the campus police, is on its way
to break up the party.

Some of the students may
begin to panic, just as Becker,
who had been banned from the
dorms as a result of an incident
in his freshman year, probably
did, in their attempts to get

could end in serious injuries

and, God forbid, maybe even

another death. ,

Instead of putting a stbp to
all parties, maybe ORL and the
alcohol task force should con-
centrate some of its energies on
alternate plans of action. Like
how to beef up security in the
dorms so unauthorized party-
throwers will not be able to get
past the front desk of the resi-
dence halls. Or investigate how
Becker did get into Bracken-
ridge and make sure it doesn’t
happen again.

The alcohol task force may
think it is doing the right thing
by outlawing parties in the
dorms, but in the long run, it
may do more harm than good.
Whether or not alcohol is a big
problem at Pitt still remains to
be seen. I have yet to see any
evidence that suggests it is one
way or the other.

If it is a big problem, then
students are still going to find a
way to drink-—either in the bars
or at friends’ apartments. Put-
ting a stop to parties in the
dorms is not going to stop stu-
dents from getting drunk or
solve the alcohol problem, if
there is one.

— The alcohol task force has felt
the pressure of the administra-
tion, the Board of Trustees and,
probably, the Oakland com-
munity. But if they think that
having intoxicated students
wandering around the streets of
Oakland is going to be safe,
they are ‘sadly mistaken.

Like the old adage says,

was madness until that moment of
pure epiphany when, in unison,

sure, the girls did give good brain.

After‘ Tuesday night’s less-than-A

basketball coach Roy Chipman‘

made it known that he wasn’t
going to take much more of the
Panthers’ play. The results were

A" ‘:3"'evident Saturday night at the Field

House—Pitt dominated Lafayette
65-52. . —

In the first half, it was the two-
man wrecking crew of Panther cen-
ter Andre Williams and forward
Clyde Vaughan that wreaked
havoc on the offensive end. The
two accounted for 29 of Pitt’s 35
first-half points as Pitt shot 60 per-
cent in" the opening period.

Lafayette was also affected by a
pressing man-to-man defense,
which was the cause of a four-for-
20 shooting from the floor.

‘Normally, the Panthers play a
1-3-1 zone, but that may change in
the future.

 “We played a lot more man-to-
inan defense tonight," Chipman
said. “We won’t be hesitant to play
it anymore.”

“I wasn’t suprised that Pitt came
out in a man-to-man defense,”
Lafayette head coach‘Will Rackley
said." “What surprised me was how
well they shot and how poorly we
shot.”

By BARRY ZASLOFF

His team was playing like it
belonged in the Little East, rather
than its new conference, the Big
East. The players had enough trou-
ble hitting the glass, let alone
shooting the ball through the
basket. They wouldn’t have been
able to pull down a big rebound if
a blonde beauty had been attached.
And they displayed about as much

excitement as anyone watching

paint dry might.

So Pitt coach Roy Chipman gave
his team a verbal lashing and three
vigorous days of practice after last
Tuesday's loss to Connecticut. The
result: A 65-52 victory last Saturday
over Lafayette, a team that Chip-
man once coached himself.

“I figured that if I made the prac-_

tices so damn‘ much like hell, the
players might better enjoy the
game "for 40 minutes,” Chipman
said afterward. “I now have a better
feel for the players after the three
gruelling practices. I know who
will stick his nose out and who
won’t." -

From the start, Clyde Vaughan,
Pitt's leading scorer and
rebounder, and Andre Williams

Panthers jumped to a 35-17 half-

points.

When Williams wasn't scoring
from inside, Vaughan was turning
the court into a shooting gallery
with his assortment of long-range
jump shots. First an 18 footer, then
a 20 footer and, just to show those
boys the city touch, a 22 footer. No
glass needed there; the net barely
got a workout.

The man-to-man defense is
physically a much more difficult
one to play. Let up there and you

_cOntinued from page seven

In the second half, Pitt eased up a
bit, but the play of two freshmen
impressed Chipman. _

Freshman guard Joey David
scored 10 points in the second
half—most coming from the 20-
foot jumpers-—and forward Matt
Miklasevich showed some hustle
and spark that were missing most
of the season. ,

“I thought that Joey did well,”
Chipman said. “And I'm notafraid
of putting the freshmen on the line

' if we need that kind of play. I’m
going to play who plays, and I”

don’t care if they're freshmen.
Maybe I have to expect (to field)
this young of a team.”

There may have been some emo-
tional ties to the game; Chipman
was head coach at Lafayette before

coming to Pitt, and his successor, »

Rackley, was his top assistant;
Rackley played under Chipman at
Hartwick. However, both coaches

said this didn’t make the game

special.

“We were ready to play,” Rack-
ley said. “It was just one of our
‘games on the schedule.”

“If we were 8-2, then emotions
may have entered into it," Chip-
man said. “But we're 5-5 and we
needed to win.”

However,two Lafayette players
didn’t share the same sentiments.
Guard Stan Morse and forward
John Coalman were teammates of
Williams’ at Murray ‘Berghaum
High School in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
where the team went undefeated in
their junior year and lost in the city
semi-finals the following year. The,‘
game marked the first time the trio
played together since high school.

“I was definitely up for the
game,” Morse, who scored 16
points for the Leopards, said. “I
have to goihome this summer and
hear his (Williams’) bragging.

The bragging may be difficult to
escape; Morse and Williams are
next-door neighbors.

“We went to the same- school
since kindergarten,” Morse said.
“He’s like my brother.”

Coalman had torgo against his
high school teammate; unfortu-
nately for the 6-7 Leopard forward,
Williams got the better of him. The
6-8 center drew two fouls on Coal-_

man within a minute and a half.
He evidently fouled out, scoring
only one point in 12 minutes of
action. -

Williams’ knowledge of Coal-
man’s abilities was useful Saturday
night. A
. “We knew each other’s style of
play," Coalman said. “And he took
me out of what I wanted to. do. He
got the best of me this time.” ’

A bit of incentive for Coalman to
play well was the attention Willi-

ams received in high school from
college recruiters.

“He was being recruited and I
wasn’t,” Coalman said. “He got a
scholarship to Pitt and I went to
Lafayette, where they don't give
athletic scholarships.”

Meanwhile, Williams was low-
key about playing against his
former high school teammates.

“They were pumped up to beat
us,” Williams said. “But I just
went out there and played.”

‘Neighborhood Shootout A Blast For Panthers

Now the emotional ties to this
game have been severed, and the
Panthers must prepare for the three
game stretch against Villanova,
West Virginia and Georgetown.

‘fThe next‘ three games are going
to very, very tough," Chipman
said. “If we would have beaten
Connecticut, we would be 7-4
going into our toughest stretch.”

“We’re going to have to play the
best games of our lives,” David
said.

Gymnasts Drop Close Meet

By BRIAN BALK 

It’s not very often that a coach
will speak of a loss in an optimistic
voice, but that is how women’s
gymnastics coach /Donna Sanft
reflected on the Lady Panthers’
debut this past weekend at the Uni-
versity of New Hampshire. . ‘

“For a loss, it was very encourag-
ing,” Sanft said. “We scored an

   

average of 8.3 on each event, which
I was very pleased with.”

The Lady Panthers were out-
scored in their season opener by a
score of 176.3 to 166.35 to a tough
New Hampshire squad. According
to Sanft, New Hampshire lost no
gymnasts to graduation and has
harbored two excellent recruits on
this year’s team. ‘ '

respects for the Panthers. It was
their first meet in the NCAA
(switching from the AIAW confer-
ence last year). It also marked the
advent of a new scoring system,
under which all five scores count
on every event. Last year, only four
scores counted.

Sanft said that she is pleased
with the new conference and the
scoring system.

“Having all five scores count
puts the pressure on everyone,
which consequently makes every-
one work harder,” she said.

The Panthers were lead by jun-
ior Karen Martin, who tallied an
all-around score of 33.95, an excel-
lent score for this early in the sea-
son. Many other Panthers
displayed mid-season form last Sat-
urday night.

Sophomore Deb Dabkowski,
who had to red-shirt last year due to
a knee operation, was back, show-
ing no traces of a 9 month layoff.
She posted a 8.05 on the uneven
bars, despite falling on her dis-
mount. Dabkowski developed a

stress fracture in her leg in the fall, _

but this injury did not hinder her
performance. -
“When Deb crossed the floor-
exercise mat before herroutine, the
word that crossed my mind was
‘ebullient,’ " said Sanft. “Her

USFL Penalizes Graduation Possibilities

.._ _-».
a..‘_.

A."' ‘

By MARK A. SINDLER

The United States Football
League (USFL) was recently estab-
lished by 12 investors who wanted a
year-round -football league. Con-
sidering the current economic sta-
tus of this nation and the fact that
the World Football League, the last
challenge to the National Football
League, withered within two years,
this is a bold move.

Whether the new league succeeds
is speculation, even though it
stands a good chance in Denver,
where 30,000 season tickets were
gobbled up. It’s pretty difficult,

though, to compete against Pete

Rozelle and the NFL.

Rozelle has been involved in
unending spats with the Oakland-
/Los Angeles Raiders owner Al
Davis since the NFL challenged the
AFL. But USFL commissioner
Chet Simmons need not worry. For
now, he has avoided direct conflict
with NFL scheduling by starting
in March and finishing in July.

What Simmons did not origi-
nally count on was a direct interfer-
ence with‘ college players’ final
term of school. What this does for
drafted seniors is seriously threaten
their chances of graduating on
time. A

Case in point is USFL firs_t-ever
draft pick Dan Marino. No doubt
the Los Angeles Express made the
right move, but it puts Marino in a
difficult position.

One question is whether Marino
will ever graduate from Pitt.‘ Will
Marino give up his dream by

detouring the JFL for the ‘USFL? .
If Marino does sign, will the prece— .

dent lead future standouts like him

. to forego graduation, thus turning

5‘ _..

universities into farm teams or
minor leagues?

Subsequent_ to Los Angeles’
selection of Marino, he said he

_ would indeed come back to school

this fall to earn the final 12 credits
he needs for a communications
degree. _

If and when the Express signs
Marino, his new contract will be
worth something in the neighbor-
hood of $375,000 per year. With
that kind of money—-which is rea-
sonable for Marino-type stature-
why would he entertain any ideas
of returning to receive his degree?

True, no one now can say that he

The Pitt News, Monday January I0, 1983. , ‘ — ,

will return, but with that kind of

money, chances are that he will
find better things to do than study
for a term.

But with the USFL structuring
its draft and the start of its seasons
smack in the middle of college
semesters, other football players
could easily be tempted to bypass
graduationfor professional foot-
ball and the big money that goes
with it. '

It’ll happen sooner or later.
Players will start their college
careers with the aspirations of
someday leaving school, hoping
that they are among the two per-
cent of college players who make
the NFL ranks. I .

But the USFL may turn colleges

into a'minor league system for both

the NFL and USFL.

Granted, there are people like
Hugh Green and Tony Dorsett in
the NFL, people who have yet to

‘graduate from college. It is no

secret that past top NFL draft picks
now play after bypassing gradua-
tion from college.

The USFL’s existence increases
the number of college football stars

‘who leave their schools without

attaining anything but glory on
the grid iron.

That may be fine for some _peo-
ple. Hcvever. if the college play-

ing field becomes a minor league
one, the players opting for early
“graduation” might consider pay-
ing for time spent in college. That
would alleviate some scholarship
burdens. .

Those same players might also
be required to offer his university
some of the dividends reaped in the

USFL as a result of college expe-

rience that made him the star he is.

This may be too idealistic, but
the fact is that the USFL is pres-
ently harming colleges. Its drafts
and its season's starting time are
much too early. Maybe an easier
solution would be moving back
both the draft and starting time so
that players are out of ‘school and
can then concentrate on playing

professionally——with a degree
behind them.

The USFL has a good chance of
succeeding against the monopolis-
tic NFL. Unfortunately, the
hoped—for success may come at the
expense of numerous degrees, turn-
ing universities into farm systems
for potentially professional
players.

G ymnasts Put Aside Iniuries I

her worth to the Panther squad,
compiling a 33.09 all-around score.
In the process, she was the top
scorer for the Lady Panthers on the
vault with, an 8.95 and on floor
exercise with a 8.8. '

“I was very pleased with Kristy’s
performance,” Sanft said. “She hit
3 out of the 4 events, which is excel-
lent for a first time freshman.”

Another Panther gymnast who
sat out last year was senior Babby
Flock. In 1982, Flock had such a
severe case of mononucleousis that
she had to miss competition. There
wasﬁo evidence of illness Saturday
night, as -she solidly competed in
every event; She tied Martin on the
uneven bars with an 8.65.

Gretchen Spiech was the only
gymnast competing while injured.
Despite a torn quadracept, she
turned in a fine all-around perfor-
mance. It was her first action as an
all-around in a year. She was suf-
fering from a bone spur that ham-
pered her ankle all season.

“New Hamphire will definitely
be one of the top contenders for the
Eastern Regional crown,” Sanft
said. “They have a lot of depth and
were throwing a lot of difficult
tricks for this early in the season-
and not one of their all-arounds
scored under 34.25.”

Sanft, however, foresees a much
closer meet when the Panthers

meet New Hampshire once again
at the regional championships.

“We try‘ to concentrate on more
execution and consistency and less
difficulty this early in the season,”
Sanft explained, "but as the season
progresses, our difficulty and
scores will increase, and it will nar-
row down to tenths of a point—j ust
like it did last year when we met
New Hampshire.” .

This Friday, the Lady Panthers

are hosting a quad meet with New I

Mexico, Michigan and Maryland.
Sanft said that all three teams are
loaded with top caliber gymnasts
and that it will be a stiff fight to
capture the top seat.
