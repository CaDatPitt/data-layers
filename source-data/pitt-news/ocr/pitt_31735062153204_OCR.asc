the cryst.allization_of advanced opinion
ordinarily follows ‘far in the ,wake of
its agitation. This series of articles
is therefore -welliworth ‘while and is,
due to the urgency of some of the

I don't know whether or not you‘
are still on speaking terms--with’me
for having neglected, so long, answer-
ing your_very ﬁne letter of June 12.
But I have foolishly waited for a time
when I should not be bothered with
the heat or mosquitos. Having dis-
covered that there is no such time in
Batavia and having become ‘more or
-less hardened I am doing it at this
late date.

A copy of the bulletinlon trade of
the Dutch East Indies which you
mentioned having completed was sent
to me,by my father. It is surely well
gotten up and very interesting. If
I can secure any information for you
or be of assistance in any way, I
wouldsurely be glad to do it. Just
say the word and I promise to reply
forthwith. “ _

Banking Methcds.

Banking here is somewhat different
than it is in the States, although we
have a’ clearing house and the ‘Java
bank acts in a similar capacity to that
of the Federal Reserve Bank, in set-
tling the balances. ,«

“Bearer” checks are used here al-
most entirely and this applies to prac-
tically all drafts issued by us on
Singapore, India gnd China points.

Our banking room is located in an
old warehouse and the ﬁxtures re-
semble that of a bar without the mir-
rors. Otherwise, however, we seem
to be supplied for occasionally our

Batavia ham and diamonds’ seem to
be in the same class, and good steaks
are most terribly conspicuous for their
absence. , .

The language most commonly used
is, of course, Dutch. There is no
English newspaper, and for the latest
news we resort to the “Straits Times,”
of Singapore. In the bank, the ma
jority of our securities are in Dutch,
and continually we are confronted
with some puzzling Qutch documents.
Of course, we do learn a little Dutch,
but the emphasis is on the “little.”

Great for Baths.

One of the most interesting sights,
to the newcomer in Batavia, is to see
the natives at their bath. Apparently
they have a strong, although misdi-
rected instinct for cleanliness. for
the “Kali” is continually crowded
with natives, some doing the family

the days of 1903 when W. U. P. was little heard of in athletics, this ﬁery “grad" and others became disgusted with
the way Penn state and other teams were coming to Pittsburgh and licking the eternal stuff out of old W. U. P.
They decided that it had to stop. So “Sam,” with “Doc" Wallgren, Dr. Judd “Judge" Fettermann, Dr. Ingram, Guy
and Dick Wallace, Ralph Park and a few others, get busy and decided to give the University a football winner.

In the last issue of the “Weekly" there appeared a general storyon the development of basket ball at the
University, reference being made to the first team representing old W. U. P. The article stated the team was
organized in the winter of 1898-99, which was in error, as it was the winter of 1897-98. Some time ago Charles F.
O'Hagan, C. E. ’00, who was manager of the team, sent us the picture of this team and we have been holding it,
awaiting anopportunity to use it. As everyone is talking basket ball right now, due to the interest in the floor
sport and the fine record the Panther varsity is making, we are glad to present the picture so “Weckly" readers

A REAL suocnss

The Pitt Weekly must say a good word for the Junior Prom
held’ last -Friday evening. ,,.~'l‘he biggest social function of the year
was certainly an unqualiﬁed success and the turnout of Pitt people
far exceededthe anticipations of the committee. Yet, even in the
face of this, the arrangements did not go awry and the smooth man-
ner in which things were handled speaks well for the labors of the
committee. Despite the fact that the great crowd rendered indi-
vidual dancing space somewhat limited, we feel sure that no one who
attended would ﬁve missed it and we desire to congratulate the
committee upon everything—the orderly and digniﬁed tone of the
dancie, the handsome favors, the music-everything that contributed
to a pleasant evening.

We think that it is not unﬁtting that Mr. Howard Krick should
have a separate word of commendation for the work he did in con-
nection with the_ Prom. His duties were exacting andthere were
many details to be attended to. Re headed a committee that pro-
duced one of the best of Proms.

V

STILL AT IT
1

Of course you know that the Sophomore class is stillat it. Their
efforts looking to better class organization and development of class
spirit can no longer be looked upon as one of those-‘sporadic attempts
at accomplishing something which are only too common. In pursu-
ance of The Weekly’s policy of boosting 1923 in their praiseworthy
plan, this small word of encouragement is inserted. Members of
1923 are excellent propagandists and their activity is their own
publicity. A class banquet is new proposed and it is to be hoped that
the peppery second year men will continue their building at this time
upon the ﬁrm foundation already laid._ I

umvrnsm LIBRARY HAS
MANY IIISTIIIIIIJAI
mwulns :

vHow' many students know that the
Universityl. library contains some and
books, pamphlets and newspapers
which are of the greatest historical
value-——publications which, dealing
with the early days of the city and
the University, present a picture of
absorbing interest? Certainly there. are
many students and perhaps a"few.in-
structors, too, who have not realized
the possibilities o.f ‘the library, or
learned the ‘pleasure of an hour’s
“browse” there.

In an old ﬁle of the Pittsburgh
Gazette. ancestor of the present—daY
Gazette Times, there is amusement as
well as instruction. The issues of 1819,

I

 

for example,. bear evidence of the

activity of the Un.iveI'sit.y in such

notices as this: « .
“NOTICE: The trustees of the

Western University of Pennsylvania
will meet, by‘ adjournment, at the
Academy in the city of Pittsburgh at
7 o'clock in the evening of the ﬁrst

« Mondayof next month. These ge-nt1e-

men named in the law of incorporation

_ who do not mean -to act as trustees

will serve the institution by sending
their, resignations to the subscriber.
(Signed) WILLIAM WILKINS, June
4, 1819.” A

One month later appeared the an
nouncement of the trustees that “All
persons indebted to the late Pittsburgh
Academy are to pay the sumsdue by
them on or before the ﬁrst of Sep-
tember next, and that suit shall im-
m‘ed.i-ately after that date be com-
menced against all delinquents, with-
out regard-to person.” ‘It was stated

' in the newspapers of Pittsburgh and
Mercer, where the earliest publica-
tions of this district were issued.

On October 6, 1819, the Gazette car-
ried an advertisement of a. book which
later attained wide recognition, and
which is of especial interest to Pitt

in 1819.

After winning thirteen» suocesisibe

in the pole vault,or over 5 feet 6 inches in the high jump, and so we are

, WATCH YOUR DATES!

A student's life is a busy life and some conﬂicts are inevitable.
Most of. them aren't. The thing we are driving at is this:
Why do Pitt students and Pitt organizations have to plan things for nights
on which there are’ home\baskct ball games?
of Pitt students attend the‘games, especially at Trees Gym, without two or
three other Pitt organizations running in competition.

ably inevitable and excusable, but we have In mind a certain’ organization
planning a function for this Friday night-—the night of the ‘W. &. J. game-—
and in all probability, unless they otherwise plan to hold it after the game,
that organization will, take 150 to 200 Pitt students away from thatgamc,
when they‘ should be up at Trees rooting their heads off for Alma Mater.
In our opinion there is no excuse whatsoever for that organization planning
their affair for that date—it would have been aneasy matter to have checked
up and seen whether there was a basket ball game. The worst.of it is that
this will be the second offense of this nature for the same crowd- This or-
ganization is supposed to stand for the highest things in Pitt.

The organization we have been

1819, calls a meeting of those inter-
ested in erecting a bridge over the
Monongahela river, the notice being
signed by John Thaw, treasurer, and
calling a meeting at the home of J. B.
Oliver-—these names being not un-
known to the Pittsburghers of today.-
Occasionally in the papers’ of that
year appeared notice such as this:
“Negro girl for sale; 12 years did but
bound to serve until 28. For rates in-
quire at the Gazette oﬁice.”

September 7, 1819, an editorial ap-
parently aimed at the legislvature. then

. about to go in session, states that

there were “Huge numbers of freed
Negroes idling about" the streets.
Pittsburgh has become a veritable

describes Mr. Wilkins’ character as
only a little inferior to that, of an
angel, ‘and says that it is absurd to
think that he -ever touched liquor. '
Again in ‘September the Gazette re-
viewed Mr. Stocktonffs book, and the
editor remarks that the “Western Cal-
culator” is /“very excellently ar-
ranged.” And after the Gazette had
published an editorial urging the legis-
l-ature to improve the turnpike and to
clear the Ohio river so that “It will not
be necessary to use a single wagon be-
tween Pittsburgh, and Wheeling,” the
Wheeling paper came -back with a joc-
ular comment to the effect that “The
water in the Ohio is‘no good until it
reaches’ Wheeling, anyway.” The
Gazette apparently lacked a sense of
humor, as itretorted with bitterness.
that “It is absurd to say that the
water below Wheelingis better than
that above.” '
