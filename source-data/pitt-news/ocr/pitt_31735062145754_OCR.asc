fourteen men's campus social fra-
ternities began yesterday morning at

tention of conducting dances tomor-
row night and Saturday night, with
smokers scheduled for last night and
Friday night. Small theater parties,
many rush luncheons and one or two
dinner rushing affairs are being
planned also by the majority of the
Greek letter groups.

Rushing ends promptly at 2 o’clock
Sunday morning, after which silence
period will go into effect, The season
was originally scheduled to begin last
Friday morning but a decision of In-
terfraternity council to follow the pre-

second semester rushing to six days
instead of nine accounts for its late
beginning,

Pasvolsky Fears
European War

Nazis’ Attitude Toward Austria
Key To Coming Crisis

 

 

“In its attitude toward the Austrian
question, Germany is following a pol-
icy which, if not stopped, will lead to
war.”

Thus declared Dr. Leo Pasvolsky,
noted economist of the Brookings in-
stitution, in his address before the
social sbience seminar Friday after-
noon on “The Austrian Crisis.”

Originally scheduled to discuss cur-
rent monetary issues, the Washington
economist and author decided at the
last minute, he said, to speak on “a
subject perhaps more vital to the
world as a whole.”

Co-author with Dr. H. G, Moulton of
the recent book, “War Debts and
World Prosperity,” Dr. Pasvolsky re-
viewed the history of post-war Europe
and the agitation among defeated pow-
ers for revision of the peace treaties.
“Up until last year,” he said, “senti-
ment in Austria generally favored
union with Germany——which would in-
volve revision, Since Hitler’s rise,
however, most Austrians would be op-
posed to such a union.”

The result of the present struggle
under Dollfuss, Dr. Pasvolsky added,
will probably be the Nazi-ﬁcation of
Austria. Yet Italy will ﬁrmly oppose
a possible “anscniuss” between the
German-speaking powers, he asserted.

‘Children Of The Moon’ Pleascs;
Setting Found Exceptionally Good

 

By WILBUR D. CLARK

The orchestra played, stage hands
hammered backstage and the woman
who sat in back of us jabbered for
ten minutes before the curtain parted
on the Pitt Player’s presentation of
“Children of the Moon,” by Martin
Flavin, in which the players made the
best of a bad play.

The play was one which was con-
ducive to an interpretation which
might have been nauseating, but
through a nicety of reserve, the play-
ers put on a performance that was a
credit to any amateur theatrical or-
ganization.

The usual faults, which apparently
amateurs are never without, were well
concealed. The surf, tired of beating
on the rock-bound coast early in the
ﬁrst act, and the audience rejoiced.
The sand, swishing back and forth in
the pan, or whatever medium was
used to produce the sound effect, made
it difﬁcult to hear the lines.

There is .some difﬁculty in picking

out any one person whose _perform-

ance was outstanding. Each character
was adequately interpreted, Jack Ham-
mersclimidt, who played the inevitable
butler, gave a delightful performance.
Though his was a role which gave
him not a great deal of time before
the audience, the character that he
created was real.

Janet Robins, in the part of Madame
Atherton, an old woman, spoke with
her usual conciseness of pronuncia-
tion, which made it a pleasure to
listen to her somewhat asinine lines.
Her bearing contributed to the totality
of effect, which gave in her interpre-
tation of a stiff, -yet good-hearted
grandmother.

Dorothy Kaufman, as Laura Ather-
ton, gave as good a performance as
any. She portrayed a selﬁsh mother
and had the play been staged any-
where but the ballroom of the Hotel
Schenley I would have hissed, so con-
vincing was her interpretation,

Charles Foreman was Major Ban-
nister. His mien was easy and on the

Psychology Forum

“Human beings in their attitude to-
ward each other show whether or not
God operates in them,” asserted Dr.
Max Schoen, of the Carnegie Institute
of Technology, in his address before
the psychology forum, February 12,
in Room 308, Alumni hall. Speaking on
“The Psychology of the God Experi-
ence,” Dr. Schoen discussed the close
relationship of God and man,

“To worship God means to have the
di 'ine attitude toward His human be-
ings,” he said. “The religious mind
sees in human beings the reflection of
God.”

The head of the psychology depart-
ment of Carnegie Tech went on to
trace “the evolution of the God idea.”
He pointed out the development of
this idea from polytheism to mono-
theism, from the many gods and the
nature gods to the tribal, and, ﬁnally,
to the personal God, “whose charac-
teristic is love, and whose‘ main con-
cern is the welfare of his children.

“The need of human beings for or-

Philosophy Professor
ProvesfAbility As
Stone Mason

 

With great seriousness and
formality, a doctor of philosophy
at the University was presented
with an honorary membership
certiﬁcate in the Bricklayers,
Masons, and Plasterers‘ Interna-
tional Union of America.

Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, head of
the department of philosophy
proved his eligibility to that
union when he expertly wielded
the trowel in setting the ﬁrst
tile in a partition which is to be
a, part of the new Faculty club
room of the Cathedral.

Stone masonry is not a new
profession to Dr. Gabbert. As he
admitted when he was standing
in overalls donned for the occa-
sion, “This is what I used to do
back in Camelsville, Kentucky,
when I was just a kid making 3-
start.”

Cathedral and its relation to Pitts-

Discuss God-Man Relationship

 

and philosophy,” Dr, Schoen further
contended. “What a scientist calls
law, the religious mind calls God;
what the artist calls beauty, is God
to the religious mind. God is spoken
of in virtues of man, and reference to
God is in terms of human attributes.
God is those attributes, while human]
beings only possess them. The God;
experience seeks this constantness in j
God.”

George Ellis Jones announced the fol-
lowing topics and speakers for future
meetings:

edge of Endocrine Disturbances in
Childhood.” February 26, Dr_ William
T. Root, head of the department of
psychology, will speak on “Evaluation
of Freudian Psychology.” March 5, A.
Falk will address the forum on “A

“Modern dictators have powers over
their subjects equal to that of me-
dieval tyrants,” he said.

Heinz Memorial Chapel
OMORRO\V’S CEREMONIES, at which the
cornerstone for Heinz lllemorial chapel will be

laid, mark another achievement in the elaborate
building program which the University has under-
taken.

Described as one of the most beautiful buildings
in Pittsburgh, the chapel will become an important
integral part of the University. In addition to its
signiﬁcance as a memorial and its attachment to
the spiritual side of University life, the chapel rep-
resents another ideal in harmony with the ideal
of the University of Pittsburgh. It is the ideal
that consolidates the spiritual natures of all creeds
and religions, of all races and types of men. In a
cosmopolitan University the preservation of this
ideal is ably contained in the Heinz Memorial
chapel.

A gift to the University by the children of the
late H. J. Heinz: Mrs. J. G. Given of New York,
Howard Heinz and Clifford S. Heinz of Pittsburgh,
the memorial is a ﬁtting tribute to a man who was
a leader in Pittsburgh ’s civic and commercial
progress.

Print Cheap-er Textbooks

SALE OF CHEAPLY-PRINTED volumes of classic

writings by Emerson, Defoe, Shakespeare, Chaucer,
and others, by a downtown department store recently, in-
dicates an avenue of escape for ﬁnancially-pressed col-
lege students to whom the purchase of textbooks every
semester is a heavy burden.

Fifteen dollars at the beginning of every semester is
too heavy a ﬁnancial load to be carried by a student who
has just ﬁnished “shelling out” for his tuition, laboratory
cards, equipment and the numerous other articles that
help to equip a college undergraduate.

ITH THE EXCEPTION of the professional schools,

whose textbooks vary slightly from year to year,
students in the undergraduate schools of the University
have little use for their books after they are graduated.
In many cases, even if they should wish to use the books,
the texts become so outmoded with annual revisions that
they become practically useless.

Publication of classical works and standard textbooks,
such as Beard’s in political science, should be made on
cheaper paper with cheaper bindings and consequently
should be sold at a lower price. Cooperation between
the faculty members and students in the College, the
School of Engineering, the School of Education, and the
other undergraduate schools might result in deﬁnite sug-
gestions on possible reductions in textbook prices. A

student-faculty committee appointed from the different‘
schools of the University should be chosen to consider
the question.

Open To All

HE EXCELLENT MOVE of Dr. Vincent L-anfear, new

dean of men, in allowing students the complete free-
dom of his office strikes a new and welcome note. Dr.
Lanfear announced recently that the door to his office on
the eighth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning would never
be closed and that students were welcome to discuss
their affairs with him at any time.

The atmosphere around the office of the dean of men
in most colleges and universities has been one of strict
formality and stiffness. This unnatural atmosphere has
been supported in the light of academic environment,
which has held traditional importance in college affairs.
Dr. Lanfear’s move, which does away with unnatural
formality, is commendable and one which will receive
the support of every student at Pitt.

No rows of secretaries face the bewildered student.
who is “in to see the dean." The informality of the of-
fice and the personality of Dr. Lanfear immediately put
the Student at ease and prepare him to discuss his prob-
lems freely. Dr. Lanfear’s move is an interesting exper-
iment in University administrative procedure.

Starvation And Single Tax

NIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO ha.ve taken eco-

nomics and know something about single tax are all
set for life. That, at least, would be the conclusion if
we were to take at face value the opinions of the omi-
nent lawyer-scholar, William N. McNair, mayor of the
city of Pittsburgh.

Following your graduation on June 6 you needn’t look
for a job because, if you know single tax, you are com-
pletely armed against the forces of starvation, unemploy-
ment, illness, and all other economic and physical
plagues that beset you. When you get hungry grab your ‘
textbook on single tax (or one of the mayor’s excellent
pamphlets) and digest a. couple of pages. It’s the first
time that we have considered ink good for your diges-
tion.

F YOU HAPPEN NOT TO BE an A student and find

yourself unemployed after graduation, read single tax
bulletins and you have nothing to worry about. Like-
wise you can scare away cholera, Amos and Andy, peo-
ple who say “Whyanchcumupsometime,” and obtuse
mothers-in—law. And if you happen to get ti job and go
out on strike, don’t ask the mayor to help do away with
police brutality, just read single tax.

The mayor’s academic viewpoint, however, is one
which discounts the criticisms of our relatives who insist
that college education means nothing. Imagine their
consternation when you begin to get rid of installment
collectors for the radio, the washing machine, and the
ﬂoor lamp just by reading single tax. College education
a la. McNair at last has come into its own.

 

Changing Hands

HE WORK OF STUDENT RELATIONS committee's

excellent investigating group has been taken over by
the members of the committee itself. The move is an
indication that the work of the committee is considered
important.

The reasons for the disbanding of the investigations
committee were not given as the group took over its ac-
tivities. The personnel of the investigating group direct-
ed impartial and consistent inquiry into the affairs of
campus organizations. It directed reform movements in
John Marshall club and in Druids, the two organizations
that it investigated.

However, since student relations committee has taken
over the activities of the investigators, the question now
lies in exactly what the group intends to do. Investiga- l
tion of undergraduate activities should be continued, buti
whether or not, in the light of what the committee has
done in the past, anything will come of its activities is
still an undecided question.

A more deﬁnite announcement of its plans for investi-
gating campus groups and a. clearer exposition of its
stand on the disbanding of the committee should be
given by the student relations group.

Editor,
Pitt News.
Dear Sir:

Your editorial policies in regard to national disarma-
ment are to be commended if for no other reason than
that they express the other side of the argument, the
side tending towards paciﬁsm—-—paciﬁsm of the nature of,
‘t:1y<t)u can’t make me ﬁght because I won’t put up my

s s.”

Please do not misunderstand me, Mr. Editor, I am no
more desirous than you, of placing myself in front of
some foreign cannon and thumbing my nose at the men
behind it. In fact the idea itself is quite repulsive to
me. I cannot help but feel, however, that your policy
if followed, would be a speedy means of placing you and
me in front of that cannon.

Perhaps I can simplify my stand by use of analogy.
Let us pretend we are on-lookers on an isolated island.
We see a group of men that inhabit this tiny bit of land.
Over there near the pool of water is Uncle Sam and he
looks worried. He watches with interest the many quar-
rels which are being fought over the smaller and dirtier
pools of water. Any moment now one of the other men
might become dissatisﬁed with his little pool and at-
tempt to secure a- larger one. Uncle Sam is aware of
this and he does not know just what to do. Of course
he is physically superior to the other men, but they have
cudgels. Should he also ﬁnd a cudgel, or should he de-
pend upon good will? VVhat do you think, Mr. Editor?

Almost all of the activities that various European nations have been re-

to that opinion, but events seem to be

cently carrying out seem to be directed towards an intensiﬁcation of the na-

tionalistic, militaristic spirit
Mr_ Douglas mentioned as the most
dangerous force operating in world
politics today. The best example of
the rise of nationalism to unrestrained
dominance can be found in Hitlerized
Germany. There, of course, aggress-
ive patriotism has become the leading
ideal_ Italy is scarcely any less de-
sirous of state glory. And now Aus-
tria is following suit.

The chief victor, of course, in the
recent Austrian uprising was the Nazi
party, which seems quite certain soon
to win control of the Austrian govern-
ment. The effect of such a Nazi con-

quest will be to change Austria into,
an official or perhaps actual but noti
official part of Germany. It will also
mean that the general European war,
so long feared, will become an ever-
present probability. And it does seem,
at present, that Dollfuss, despite
struggles that he may make, will be
overpowered by the Nazis, who are
now his only real opponents. The lit-
tle Austrian chancellor may be able
to stave off defeat for quite a few
months or may even become the
ﬁgurehead for actual Nazi rule. But,
in the end, the Nazis will conquer and
they will carry out, to the best of their
abilities, the policies they now pro-
claim.
T IS A MATTER of importance,
indeed, to the rest of Europe as
to whether Dollfuss or the Hitler ad-~.
herents gain ultimate control of
Austria, There is little difference,
perhaps, in domestic policy between
Dollfuss forces and Hitler adherents.
The distinction there can be found in
the greater emphasis placed by the
Hitlerites on a. centralized, uniﬁed
state, on absolute repression of all in-,

tellectual freedom, and on the neces-l

sity for unblended racial unity. But’
to France, England, Poland, and even

the United States, it is of crucial im-

portance to keep the Nazis from put-

ting their foreign policy into effect.

The Nazis desire the Anschluss, the

union of Austria, and Germany, so

that the movement for recovery from

the Allies of lost territories may

gather strength, There is a strong pos-
sibility that Austria and Germany, if
united, will move towards expansion,

perhaps toward the East or maybe

toward the West. Either way, France

is in a spot. If the Nazis should

eventually strike at the Vlfest, it will

be for ground belonging to France. If
they shall strike at the East, it will
be for land belonging to allies of

France_ I

The likely Hitler control of Austria
thus means that friction will increase
between Germany and France. This
seems even more probable since the
recent troubles in France has had the
effect of giving more power to the
French right, which is also pro-na-
tiona1istic_ Despite Monday's general
strike against fascism in France, the
trend there should be towards an
emphasis on a strong policy against
Germany. Increase of executive
power and the effect of capitalistic
depression will almost surely bring
on in France a growth of nationalism.
France has always been, in the post-
war period, insistent on security.
That attitude will become ever more
evident in proportion to the rise of
Hit1él'iSm in other countries. And.
when the appropriate time comes,
there is every reason to believe that
the two conflicting desires of France
and Germany will clash. Then, well,
look at the war pictures that are be-
ing printed so profusely, if you want
to see yourself three or four years
from now.

Italy is as important a factor in the
European situation as France, Like
France, and perhaps to an even great-
er extent, Italy fears it German and
Austrian combination. After the war,
Italy took from Austria 3. small strip
of territory which has, since that
time, been a sore spot of Europe.
Austria. has always been desirous of
regaining that territory and a power-
ful Austro-German combine might
well attempt to regain it. Italy will
not tolerate such an attempt and will
exert every force, possibly even to
invasion to prevent it.
esting note that German Fascism and
Italian Fascism, alike in philosophy,
should conﬂict in putting into action
that philosophy.

HE RISE OF fascism does not

carry the seed of destruction only
in foreign policies. After all, war is
likely to come between Russia and
Japan even before it hits Europe.
But the growth of fascism seems like-
ly to obliterate all traces -of li-beral
culture and art, before it goes down
to its inevitable defeat. Fascism will
probably spread in Europe in the next
couple of years. As each capitalistic
country ﬁnds itself in the unavoidable
depression and as the Socialistic
groups strike for power, it is but
natural for the ruling economic class
to attempt to retain power, Such a
class does so through the medium of
Fascism, This thesis, of course, does
not necessarily hold true for all na-
tions, It is quite possible that such
countries as the United States and
England and France may escape it.

THE POET
Once upon a time there was a poet.
That is, he thought that he was a
poet. When he saw beauty in any of,
its disguises, in a sunset or in the re—-
flection of lights on black, water at‘
night, he wrote on paper what hei
said that he felt in his “soul.” How-
ever, it so happened that the worldi
little appreciated his efforts, Of course 1
the world had not had much of an op- g
portunity to appreciate them becausel
every time he sent ,a manuscript fol
a publisher it came back. And every [
time one came back, he read it over
and swore to God that he would never
write another. Then he would see
something “inspiring” and write an-
other poem. So it went.

In communion with his soul one
night, after a particularly trying day,
during which three manuscripts had
come back, he decided that the trouble
was not with his poetry but rather
with himself. He was too ordinary.
People didn't stop to look twice at
him on the street; truck drivers
stopped him to ask for a light and
called him “Bud.” And he had ab-
solutely no eccentricities. His room
was ordinary, his walk was ordinary
and it seemed to him then that it
was little wonder that his poems al-
ways came back. In short, or long if
you like, he decided that he would
have to become a poet not only in the
matter of writing words that swung
along and rhymed occasionally, but
also in the matter of looking like a
poet,

It took a month to complete the
transformation. During that time he
slept often in his clothes and let his
hair grow. He moved, he sold all his
furniture, bought so-called “modern-
istic” furnishings and installed them
in an attic that had but recently be-
come a garret. Over his head at night
spiders spun their Webs from rafter
to rafter, and during the day, as he
tried to weave images into the pat-
tern of his poetry the sun slanted
through the paper-patched pane, The
change had taken timeand effort, but
the poet noticed that some times peo-
ple started at him, and oncehe heard
a child ask its mother who the funny
man was. And so he was happy.

The Poet was a poet now. He not
only wrote verse, but looked the part
as well. And so, for the ﬁrst time
since his transformation he wrote a
poem. After it was done, he viewed
it critically, admitted to himself that
it was pretty good, and sent it away
as he had sent many others.

But this, he was certain, would not
come back. It couldn’t. IIe was a
poet, lived like a poet and looked like
a poet.

But it did come back.

‘been approved for the past number,‘

of years for general elementary and,-
secondary school teaching in New
York state, the specialized curricula
in commercial and physical education
have just been approved, according to
Theodore A. Siedle, assistant to the
dean in the School of Education.

With the cooperation 0:": Dr. E. S.
Mooney, Jr., associate supervisor of
the New York state education depart-
ment, the specialized curricula offered
at the University were reviewed and
evaluated for purposes of certiﬁcation,
«Graduates of these curricula may now

to teach in their respective ﬁelds of
specialization.

According to Mr. Siedle, formal ap-
proval was received Thursday from
Dr, Herman Cooper, assistant com-
missioner in. charge of teacher edu-
cation and certiﬁcation in New York.
Dr. Cooper’s approval included all
curricula offered by the School of Ed-

“The teacher education and cer-

dentials issued by this department
with the understanding that the cer-
-tiﬁcation divisions of the state edu-

cula will be restricted to teaching in
their respective ﬁelds of specializa-

have been the lesser of two evils,

he was good. His voice was natural

He just wasn’t “mad” enough,

Women Debaters To Use
Oregon Plan Tomorrow

A slight deviation from the regular
type of debate will feature the women
debaters’ only meeting of this week.
Tomorrow an affirmative and nega-
tive Pitt team will speak at the Wight-
man school before the Parent-Teach-
.ers association.

The discussion will take the form of
an Oregon debate. Following two
constructive speeches by each side,
the opponents will cross-examine each
other. Betty Glass, C36, Ruth Tonkin,
C36, and Marjorie Hanson, C34, will
take the affirmative side of the NRA
question against a negative team com-
posed of Agnes Calabrese, BA35, Mar-
guerite Swank, C36, and Rosalyn

Doctor Carlson’s Star

Basketball Players

 

The critics who maintain that
college athletes don’t see a whole
lot of the inside of classrooms
will get a rude setback from a
glance at the schedules of the
Pitt basketball ﬁve. These boys
average 33.6 hours of class a.
week, a number much higher than
the 19 which is an average Pitt
man’s schedule.

Don M,cCamant, junior in the

_ School of Dentistry, is high-point
man in this department of scor-
ing, Don attends 42 hours of
classes a week as a junior in that
school. Close behind McCamant
are the Hughes brothers, Charley
and Skip, who put in 41 hours a
week at classes as pre-juniors in
the School of Dentistry,

Russ Ochsenhirt, a student of
Electrical engineering, comes
next with 25 hours to his credit.
Russ commutes from West View
every day and ﬁnds time to lead
an occasional Engineers’ dance
besides. Claire Cribbs takes a
comparatively easy week’s work
which equals the average stu-
dent's total of 19. ‘

The Hughes boys have particu-
larly nice days on Wednesday.
and Friday. They start at 8 .in
the morning and continue until 5
in the afternoon, with an hour. oﬁ
for lunch. Add to this a soft
snap such as a Pitt-Duquesne
game for an evening's entertain-
ment and the boys likely feel in
tip-top shape for a late dance.
Don McCamant probably prefers
Thursday night games inasmuch
as he can rest up, with only eight
hours of classes on his card for
that day.

Ochsenhirt has six hours on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fri-
days during which he can worry
about his slide-rule, log books,
and so forth. Cribbs warms up
for his daily basketball practice
witha bit of light exercise in the
swimming, tumbling an-d gymnas-
tic activities which are the lot of
a physical education major.

All of which shows why Dr.
Carlson would like to play all his
games on Saturdays. None of the
boys has more than four hours
of school on Saturday.

Pitt Opposes Westminster Here
Tomorrow In Battle For District
Basketball Championship Honors

 

A
‘V

Coach Johnny LaWther‘Weather Hinders

Brings High-Class
Team For Tilt

The eyes of every basketball fan
in this district will be turned tomor-
row night toward the Stadium Pavil-
ion where the Golden Panther-s will
meet Westminster’s Titans in a game
that may go far toward determining
who may rightfully rule the roost as
district cage champion.

It is generally conceded that Pitt,
Westminster, and Duquesne’s Dukes
are far and away the best outﬁts in
the section this season. Both teams
playing tomorrow night have won
and lost to the Dukes this year; both
of them downed Duquesne in their sec-
ond meeting with the :Dukes. If this
latter fact is an indication that the
Panthers and Titans have become
stronger as the season progressed,
then tomorrow's winner might well
be termed the best team in the dis-
trict. The case may be more strongly
argued should the victors win -by a
decisive score.

Westminster comes to the Stadium
boasting an enviable record in matter
of games won. The Titans, after
dropping their ﬁrst two contests of
the season, have come out on the
long end of the sco-re in 18 out of
the last 19 encounters, the setback ad-
ministered by Duquesne being the only
loss suffered since the outset of their
cage season, While most of the teams

 

which fell before the onslaught of theI

high-scoring Titans are not of major
calibre, there is no dismissing the fact
that the New Wilmington boys were
a very good match for the Dukes.

Leading the Titan offense is the
six foot, three inch Wesley Bennett
who has piled up a staggering num-
ber of points thus far. Bennett plays
the center position and specializes
with a hook shot which has netted
him many ﬁeld goals. Fully as im-
portant a cog in the Westminster
machine is Captain William Douglass,
a forward, who goes one inch over
the six foot mark and uses that
height to good advantage in playing
a masterful ﬂoor game. At the op-
posite forward will be Peter Ley-
shock, a junior, who played bang-up
ball in the two games with Duquesne-

Harry Hunneke and John Wilhelm
are the regular Titan guards. The
former is a junior while the latter is
playing his last season of college
ball. Both are profficient men in the
back court besides having a good
eye for the hoop. Ray Sweeney,
Youngstown lad, is the ace utility man
for the Lawther-coached team and
will likely see considerable service
against Pitt. Sweeney is reputed to
have a dead eye for the basket when
the points count most.

Against this array of talent Coach
Carlson will send the ﬁve which has
had pretty fair success in contests
with the best teams in the country.
Paralleling the Titans in the matter
of a. slow start, the Panthers have
moved along with steadily increasing
good style, now and then reaching a
peak well nigh to perfection. The
starting ﬁve has remained the same
throughout and no particular star has
developed from the group. The battle
between Pitt’s Claire Cribbs and Ben-
nett will be a highlight of the even-
ing tomorrow, however, and upon the
outcome of that duel may rest the re-
sult of the game. The Jeannette star
is generally at his best when the go-
ing is toughest and he thrives on stiff
competition. Pitt’s forwards will be
Skip Hughes and either Roderick or
Wainio while Russ Ochsenhirt and
Don Mccamant will be at the guards.
The game will get under way at 8:15.

Pitt Wins Again
Over Irish Team

 

Golden Cats Put On Brilliant
Passing Game Before 6,000

 

Pitt’s Golden Panthers carved them-
selves another niche in the Irish hall
of fame as they turned the trick on
Notre Dame once more to win out by
a 21-17 score. Claire Cribbs, star Pan-
ther center, did most of the hammer
and chisel work.

Playing without the dependable
Charley Hughes, who was conﬁned to
bed with a heavy cold, the Cats hop-
ped away to an early 7-2 lead, a spurt
which took most of the ﬁght from the
Irish. The South Benders rallied
brieﬂy to forge ahead at 8-7, but the
Panthers then turned on the power
and held the lead from then on.

Exhibiting a passing attack which
thrilled the 6,000 fans who jammed
the Notre Dame pavilion, Pitt kept
possession of the ball enough of the
time to halt whatever scoring the
frantic Irish had in mind. Carlson’s
men also presented a stout defense,
holding the Notre Dame team which
had averaged 35 points per game to a
mere ﬁve ﬁeld goals. Voegele led the
Irish with eight points.

Skip Hughes counted ﬁve free
throws and a ﬁeld goal to head the
Pitt scorers while Cri-bbs netted six
points, besides holding the vaunted
Krause to one ﬁeld goal.

Panther Riﬂers

Tea.m’s Average Score Drops
With Thermometer

 

The cold weather in the past week,
which made it almost impossible for
Coach Lieutenant Wilson's riﬁemen
to steady their riﬂes in last week’s
shooting matches, accounts for the
team's decided slump in their score.
Up until last Week the team turned
in scores on an average approximately
thirty points higher than the score
recorded last week, which was 1,337.

The ﬁve high scorers on the Pan-
ther team were: Weitershausen, 271;
Frabatta, 268; Zoller, 268; Hykes, 266
and Mastrucci, 264:-The next ﬁve men
were: Davis, 262; Trueman, 258; J.
Duff, 258; Dorrance, 256, and Rizen-
stien, 256. Their scores were not
counted in team total, as only ﬁve
scores are counted in collegiate
matches,

The riﬂers will have to wait for
the scores from other schools in the
shooting contest, which will determine
the number of matches won or lost.
Other teams in the matches included:
The University of Cincinnati, George-
town, Washington University, Univer-
sity of Illinois, University ‘of Mary-
land, Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute,
University of Indiana, City College of
New York, and Michigan State col-
lege.

The strong West Virginia wrestling
team defeated the Pitt team at Mor-
gantown Saturday night 26 to 10. It

were in a wrestling match even
though they did win six of the
matches.

Barr and Hinchberger gave the Pan-
thers two victories on throws, while

14 Records Fall
As Track Stars
Shine In Games

Wagenhouser Turns In Great
Performance As Mile-Run
Mark Is Brought Down

Setting up new records in 14 events,
the varsity and freshman track stars
had a banner day at the Track House
Saturday afternoon. A large crowd
witnessed the series of brilliant per-
formances in which the efforts of Ken
Wagenhouser in the mile run shone
out most brilliantly.

Wagenhouser ran a beautiful mile,
staying behind Bill Keller until the
very last lap and then putting on a
burst of speed which carried him
away to victory in the fast time of
4:335. This mark cracked the one
set by Leis back in 1925 by 4.7 sec-
onds.

Pete Avizienis turned in the second
most notable performance by adding
a fraction of an inch less than 10 feet
to the existing freshman 12-pound
shot-put mark. ‘The Mt. Carmel boy
heaved the iron ball 50 feet, 41,5
inches.

Six of the new records came in the
short dashes and in the hurdles,
whose distances were lengthened to
50 yards. Schlossberg, Guay, and
Fleming are the new holders of the
records. Fred Kiger ﬂashed wonder-
ful form to lower the mark in the two-
lap dash while Scott broke the run-
ning broad jump record by half an
inch. Scott also added a record-
smashing hop, step, and jump of 41
feet, 81,; inches to his string of ac-
complishments to win that event.

Andy Lasky, of New Castle, made a
clean sweep of the dashes and hurdles
to become the record-holder for these
three events. Tost set a new mark in
the mile run in addition to winning
the two-lap dash and the 880-yard run.
Taano established a new record in the
high jump while Gerrety and Johnson
combined to put up a new pole-cvault
record for future freshmen to shoot
at. _.

Pitt Relay Team
Sets AMA Mark

Hanna, Adlersberg, Lindberg, And
Denny Establish New Record

The Allegheny Mountain Associa-
tion record for the 400-yard relay
race was broken Saturday night at
the Keystone club pool, by a Pitt team
composed of Jack Denny, Jack Hanna,
Herman Adlersberg, and Russell Lind-
berg. They covered the distance in
3.50, which was one second better
than the former record made by the
same quartet in a meet last year.

An unattached team composed of
swimmers from three different swim-
ming clubs including Brodi, A. Manko,
R. Manko, and Breukle, nosed out the
Pitt team made up of: Chambers,
Madden, Rhue, and Paul Stinner.
Lewis, Jones, Swazuk, and Schmeiler
formed a third Panther team and ﬁn-
ished in fourth place, to give Pitt
three out of four places.

Coach Pat Corr intends to enter a
strong list of contenders in an AMA
meet sponsored by Jack Scarry’s
Homestead Library club on February
21. From the list of events it looks
as though the meet will turn out to be
the best swimming affair to take
place in Western Pennsylvania in sev-
eral years.

Heading the list of events are two
AMA senior championship races, one
the 220-yard freestyle race for men, and
the other a 500-yard freestyle race for
women. In both of the championship
races the present title holders will en-
deavor to retain their crowns. Russell
Lindberg, Pitt swimmer, holder of the
220 crown, and Miss Lenore Kight,
500-yard champion freestyle swimmer,
and member of the Olympic team, are
entered in the meet.

Two other events, both junior AMA
championships include 220-yard free-
style races for men, and a 100-yard
freestyle race for women.

Pitt News Sports Editor
After the AMA swimming meet at the Keystone Club Saturday night at

which a Pitt team composed of Denny, Hanna, Adlersberg, and Lindberg set.

a new record for the 400—yard free style relay, Adlersberg, Lindberg, Stinner.

and Madden representing the swimming squad and Jimmie Nelson and ye‘

humble (very bad form we know) correspondent representing the News

formed a theater party. Everyone was having a really ﬁne time until one of

our man McNair’s ﬁnest came back and declared so that everyone might

hear, “If you mugs want to stay III¢T

here you’ll have to cut out that hol-

and Ormistoii among others are back
next year to ﬁll the guard positions.
