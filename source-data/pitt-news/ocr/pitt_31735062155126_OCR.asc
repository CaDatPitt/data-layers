‘Ideas’
Reviewed
By Culver

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN
Dr. Montgomery M. Culver
reviewed the student literary
magazine, Ideas and Figures,
and its parody issue, Monday
in the Fine Books Room at

the Book Center. He stated that
the “most consistently reward-

ing work of art is associated ‘

with the parody issue.”

Dr. Culver, associate professor
of English, commended the main
contributor to the Pa1‘0dY issue,
Bill Bennett, for his “astonishing
job of parodying,” as he magni-
ﬁed every minor ﬂaw, especially
the weakness of tone. Citing the
editor’s note on “A Vocabulary of
Conservatism,” Culver illustrated
how effectively the weakness of
the original was exploited in the
parody.

There is a lack of humor in
Ideas and Figures, Culver said,
adding that only in Dee Ann
Birch’s poem was there the “re-
lief of a smile.” »

“It is the editor’s business to
take a ﬁrm hand with his best
writers,” Culver emphasized. He
cited the stories by Annamae
Pavlosky, and to a lesser extent,
by Ron Caplan, as examples of
not adhering to this principle‘. He
classiﬁed Miss Pavlosky’s story
as a failure and criticized Cap-
1an’s story as lacking in tone.

He felt that the poetry section
was the best of any Ideas and
Figures issue for quantity and
consistency. The poems by Gwen
Visser, Anne Fertik, R. Morgan
Morrison, and Ann Richardson,
said Culver, were “without the
hollowness of tone usually found
in student poetry."

Debate Head
Takes Prize  

Wolf Swoboda, president of
the William Pitt Debate Union
(WPDU), placed second in the

. St. Michael’s Parliamentary De-

bate Tournament last week in
Toronto, Canada. He and his col-
league, Carolyn Szolis, also cap-
tured second place in the team

division. Topics at the tourna-

ment included: “Resolved: That
woman rules still,” and “Re-
solved: That today is ours.”

At the same time two other
University teams participated in
the Chicago National Debate
Tournament with 70 other schools.
The affirmative team of Carol
Durant and Don Loet scored a 1-5
record for the University team,
with the negative team, Steve
Lightman and Peter Kenny, scor-
ing 6-0.

Three WPDU teams will parti-
cipate in tournaments this week-
end. Tom Zaucha, Marty Engels,
Bcnnie Meikrantz and Dave Cor-
nelius are slated for the St. Jo-
S€Dh’s College Tournament; Mah-
mood Mamdani and Jim Moyer
will travel to Toronto for The
UniVe1‘Sit3' of Toronto Parliamen-
tary Debate Tournament, and
Armand Belly, Bob Debicarro,
Richard Bryan, and Alex Frank
will participate in the Edinboro
State College Tournament.

Fund drive ended Monday with
103 per cent of the goal sub-
scribed, Dr. Charles H. Peake,
general chairman, has announced.

More than -$46,000 was pledged
by the University’s faculty and
staff during the ﬁve-week cam-
paign, surpassing the goal of $45,-

campaign, Dr. Peake said, was
the participation by Men’s Dorm
Council. Resident men pledged
$150 to this year’s effort.

He said, “That, added to a 77
per cent participation of faculty
and staff, made this the most suc-
cessful United Fund campaigi
ever conducted at the Univer-
sity.”

Betters, Checkers Played at Dinner

Homecoming Acclaimed Successful

ByNA.NCYFUCHSandALJANEzIO g

Homcoming roared in at 4 Friday after-
noon with a pep rally and waltzed out at
1 a.m. Sunday. In between some students
rocked, some rolled and others fell down steps all
soused up. But between burps and hiccups, two-steps
and two-timers, there was a general agreement: It
was worth all the time, trouble, and money that
go into a once-a-year affair called Homecoming.

No sooner had students yelled, clapped and
hooted at the pep rally on the Student Union lawn
than they ambled to the Towers for what started
out as .a calm meal. The ﬁghts ﬂicked and some
comedians tried playing checkers on the checkered
tablecolths with green peas. But no one noticed.
There were more conspicuous things going on, like
watching couples twist up to the serving line and
seeing tray-tottlers dodge them. Saga food service
had sprung a surprise and it was Harold Betters.
He and his cohorts tooted their instruments until
the napkins caught the beat and ﬂuttered down from
their racks. It was Homecoming and it had barely
begun.

In sportcoat weather, 1,600 students ﬁled into
the Carnegie Music Hall for what proved to be for
many the highlight of the entire weekend. When
all were settled, the orchestra screamed a fan-fare
announcing Jim Smith, Homecoming chairman. His
appearance was not nearly as surprising as what
he said. He tactfully told the crowd to leave the hall.
Many feared near panic. Would the patrons shout
for their money back? But Smith was not ﬁnished.
He only wanted the crowd to leave before 11 pm.
If not, he said, the Homecoming committee would
be assessed another $1,000. Result: Everyone was
out by 10:45.

The intervening program of the Mandrell Sing-
ers, Jackie Vernon and Bobby Rydell was disap-
pointing in only one way: there was too much of
Vernon and not enough of the Mandrell Singers.
Vernon with a dead pan expression was funny at
times and at times just dull. Rydell was. drowned
by the sound of his own faithful drummer, and
somehow he didn’t quite comevcff with his teenage

image at the college affair. As for the Mandrell
Singers, they could have made the Buckingham
guards smile. Between slightly tainted jokes, they
were the hit of the evening. Everyone ﬁled out be-
fore 11 ,.p.m., but Saturday was another day and it
began early.

Football enthusiasts who went to Saturday’s
game expecting to see the Panthers slaughtered by
the Irish were pleasantly surprised. The luck of the
Irish almost failed them, making the game as ex-
citing as last year’s Homecoming game with Syra-
cuse. Saturday's Indian Summer weather was in
stark contrast with the winter blizzard that swept
the stadium last year.

The barmers were a disappointment to many
spectators. The absence of ﬂoats was lamented, but
it was hoped that the banners made of chicken wire
stuffed with paper napkins would be the next best
thing. Students complained that they were not large
enough to be seen across the stadium and that they
were not much more effective than banners painted
on sheets.

“Rollover the Clover” and “Irish Discover Fire
at Pitt” were two of the banners carrying out the
theme of “Famous Firsts.” There were several dup-
lications of themes, Adam and Eve being the most
popular.

The spectators roared at half-time ceremonies
as Homecoming Chairman Jim Smith aimouncedz

“Our Chancellor is coming up the steps” and the .

Panther climbed up before him. Just as Chancellor :

Litchﬁeld was to announce the Homecoming Queen, ',

a crowd of Notre Dame supporters forming a tun-
nel on the ﬁeld, cheered as their team ran on the
ﬁeld. _

After that noisy interruption, the Chancellor
proclaimed Ann Coleman Homecoming Queen and
kissed the blonde-haired senior on the cheek.

A candle-light dinner in the cafeteria set the
mood for Saturday night’s dance at Webster Hall.
With two ballrooms and two bands, Dan Wade's Or-
chestra and the Pharoahs, playing different types
of music there was ample room for dancing and
music to suit everyone’s taste.

 ihwﬁieness. Most. ‘offt—he‘ voters had _made their decision
 ' ‘L ' l ’ before ‘the campaign had begun.

More than ever before this was
a presidential campaign based on
the personalities of the candidates.‘
The majority of the populace had
rejected the ‘Goldrw-ater image at an
early date. Johnson was almost as-
sured of winning. As the months
went by,-the job of the pollsters be-
came merely to ascertain by how
much.

FRANK SKEFFINGTON, the
vote - seeking, down-to-the-precinct
 V NIBNFELD Boston mayor in The Last Hurrah

‘ ‘called politics the nation’s number one spectator sport.
7  The 1964 presidential campaign was just this kind of a
0 page one sports event. As the campaign continued and as
_ the months wore on however, the public tired of the mud-
slinging and name calling by some of those pursuing the
. nation’s highest offices or by their representatives and
‘PR men. ’
‘ When a football game becomes a runaway, the tele-
‘vision viewer can easily lose interest in the contest. By
turning the channel selector he can watch the action of
two less hi'ghly-touted teams playing a much closer, more
interesting game. And so the voters turned to the Senate
and gubernatorial races.

The spectator became interested in the new race, and
once more passed judgement on the personalities involved.
Hugh Scott overcame a 1,370,000 Johnson lead in Penn-
sylvania to defeat Genevieve Blatt and to be re-elected to

_ the Senate by some 30,000 votes. _

BUT SCOTT WAS one of the lucky ones. The viewers

chose to watch his race. Whether they based their decision
f‘on§Jpersonality, issues, or both, the voters were aware of
the man, Scott, not just the candidate, Republican.

_ Incumbent Republican Judge Robert Woodside wasn’t
quite so lucky. The contest for a ten year seat on the
-bench of the state Superior Court just doesn’t have the
‘glamour a Senate race has surrounding it. Most judges
1can’t afford to take many months to campaign and call

 , each‘ other names. They run on the party ticket, hope for
strong candidates -at the top of the slate and read the
papers for editorial endorsement.

The national civil rights
movement was dealt a se-
vere blow last_ week when
the California electorate vot-
ed overwhelmingly torepeal
that state’s fair housing le-

gislation. By nearly a two-.

to-one margin the voters ap-
proved through referendum
the controversial “Proposi-
tion 14,” designed. to nullify

  , the Rumford
. Act, which
, since its pas-

    

in a t i o n in
housing.
 . Initiated by
SOHLOSSEB the 50,000-
member California Real Es-
state .Association, Proposi-

tion 14 was an innocuously

worded, “let-freedom-ring”
amendment, the tone of
which was so totally reason-
able that some sixty per cent
of’ the Negroes interviewed
reacted favorably to it. As
one might imagine, the luna-
tic right-wing, now as inte-
gral a part of California life
as are Disneyland and the
movie colony, was quick to
align itself with the vested
real estate interests
The philosophical foun-
dation of their crusade was
perhaps stated best by No-
lan Frizzelle, president of
the far-right California Re-
publican Assembly, who ar-
gued that “the essence of
freedom is the right to dis-
criminate. Discrimination
means free choice.”
PREDICTABLY, OPPOSI-
TION to the amendment was
led by the civil rights or-
ganizations, but joining with
them were labor unions, the
League of Women Voters,
lawyers’ and teachers’ asso-
ciations, and many members
of .the religious community
(save Cardinal James F. A.
McIntyre, who is rapidly se-
curing a reputation for mor-
al» abdication in such mat-

ters). Governor Pat Brown _

and Democratic senatorial
candidate Pierre Salinger
repeatedly urged the voters
‘ to reject “_14.’-’

issue. Senator Barry Cold-

.Water, when asked to -com-

ment on the volitaile amend-
ment, insisted that it was a
matter of local concern (al-
though this same'Mr. Gold-
water, sensing an opportun-

ity to exploit racial tensions,
jumped head-first into the _

New York City school bus
controversy) .

' CALIFORNIA, although
it is’ now our most heavily
populated state, is simul-
taneously the most politic-
ally immature. The conco-
mitant of mobility and sud-
den affluence has been a
curious schizophrenia in po-
litical affairs, which mani-
fests itself in right-wing.ac-
tivity.

Suchsuper-patriotic
groups as the John Birch
Society, the Minutemen and
the Christian Anti-Commun-
ist Crusade flourish in sec-
tions in which there is an
absence of political and so-
cial continuity and an excess
of anxiety and frustration.
In this environment it is,
however regrettable, fully
understandable that such an
amendment as Proposition
14 should succeed.

Proponents of fair hous-
ing in California must now
regroup their polyglot forc-
es and must, as Governor
Brown has suggested, carry
the fight into the courts on

the grounds that the amend-
ment violates the “equal pro-
tection” provisions of the
United States Constitution.

IT IS IN CONCEIVABLE
thatthe most -populous state
in the Union should be with-
out a law prohibiting racial
discrimination in housing.
The tragic -repeal ‘of the
Rumford Act, although a
costly setback to the cause
of equal rights, serves as a
vivid example of the extent
to which a well -_ financed
minority can influence pub-
lic policy-.

It has traditionally been '

the responsibility of _the
Amerian‘ liberal to be the

‘guardian of civil liberties.

The radical right, although

it marches under the ban-.

ner of conservatism and con-
stitutionalism, is in fact
concerned only with the
right to economic pursuit.

It must be remembered
that the ultra-conservatives,
were they to prevail, would
launch a neo-McCarthyist
campaign against “subver-
sives” in our academic and
pubic life and would leave
the Negro to the tender mer-
cies of the white suprema-
cists of the Deep South.

The familiar coalition of
the vested interests and the
lunatic fringe must be an
object of our vigilance.

“'lhe development
of management
is essential

to our goal of
great growth”

At the 1964 stockholders’ meeting, Arjay R. Miller,_

President of Ford Motor Company, emphasized the

Company's far-sighted recruitment program and its accent
. on developing management talent:

"One aspect of our planning is crucial to the success of
everything else we do. It engages the bestthoughts and efforts of
our whole management team, from top to bottom, throughout the
world. I am speaking of the development of management. The
immediate future of our Company depends heavily upon the abilities
of the people who are new key members of our management team.

‘‘In the longer run, our future depends on what we are doing at

the present time to attract and develop the people who will

be making the major decisions 10 to 20 years from now. We are
developing management competence in depth in order to attack the-
problems that will confront a company of great growth—and '

great growth‘(both in proﬁts and sales) is exactly the goal

we, have established for Ford Motor Company.

“We are continuing to emphasize recruiting. Last spring, 180‘ of our
‘managementpeople devoted part of their time to recruiting
outstanding graduates from colleges and universities -throughout
the U.S. Last year, these efforts resulted in our hiring over

1,000 graduates, 229 more than the year before.

“We are seeking and we are finding young men—and young women,
too—with brains and backbone—p'eople who have the ability and '
the desire to make room for themselves at the top. We give our
trainees challenging assignments with as much responsibility as
they can carry. We promote them as fast as they are ready. Those
who are interested in easy security soon drop out. Those who

have what we want stay with us, and move up quickly to increased
responsibility and the pay that goes with it. Thanks to the quality
of the people we are recruiting and developing, l am/ﬁrmly
convinced that our outlook is most promising."

Creates Weak Offense

_1 dB! BILL CABIN

 The soccer team attempts to end its losing streak this
Saturday when its plays at Bucknell University. Bucknell
has a poor rating, posting a 1-8 record, and being out-
scored 30-9. ‘ _

The booters haven’t won a game since their 2-0 defeat
of Howard on October 17. The Howard‘ victory boosted
their record to 4-1, and the out- I‘

a look was good for an NCAA play-

_ ‘ off berth.

Z Since then they have lost suc-
cessively to Grove City, Mary-
land and Akron, being outscored
13-6. Coach Leo Bemis attributes
the change in pace to the effects
of the Grove City game and Lack
of eificient shooting.

 I “The boys just haven’t come
around since the Grove City
game,” Bemis said. “Our.shoot-

ability. Maryland dazzled the
booters with their -quick switches
(linemen switching positions) on
the line, which has earned them,
an NCAA berth in four of the
last ﬁve years. The Panthers lack
this versatility.

A major cause of this failure
has been their inability to pose
a threat from the center forward
position.

® The Washington Circumferential Highway allows speedy ac-
cess to best suburban communities in the District of Columbia,
Maryland, and Northern Virginia.

® HYDROMECHANICS LABORATORY facilities include this High-
Speed Towing Basin almost 3/5 OF A MILE LONG, 50 feet wide,
and 20 feet deep. This Laboratory is concerned with speed, sta-
bility, control and seakeeplng qualities of ﬂoating or submerged
naval designs, and with fundamental naval hydrodynamics.

® APPLIED MATHEMATICS LABORATORY facilities include the
latest, largest computer systems, and feature the LARC the
IBM 7090, and a 1401. This is BuShips' primary computing fa-
cility, working on engineering, research logistics, and numerical
methods. Work carried on here involves mathematic simulation
of the life cycle of nuclear reactors; automatic calculation of

ship lines; and applications of computers to management prob- ‘-

lems.

@ in this giant new Maneuvering and seakeeplng facility,
both ﬁxed and free-running models may be tested under any
sea-state condition. You may also work with the High-Speed
Phenomena Division at Langley Field, Virginia.

® AERODYNAMICS LABORATORY facilities include several
wind tunnels—ranging from subsonic through hypersonic at
Mach 10—which are used to determine and improve static sta-
bility, control and heat transfer characteristics of helicopters,
VTOL’s, supersonic aircraft, missiles, etc. Air flow studies also
involve bomb design, bridge structures, aircraft turbulence when
approaching carriers, and other government and private prob-
lems.

© The unique STRUCTURAL MECHANICS LABORATORY facili-
ties at carderock are the new pressure tanks which permit the
study, by "means of large structural models, of the hull struc-
tures for deep diving submarines and deep sea research vehicles
to reach all ocean depths. Additional Structural Mechanics Labo-
ratory facilities are scattered throughout the 186 acres, and
include a tridimensional Static-Load Frame, a Pentagonal Test
Pond, Explosion Pits, and a 600,000-Pound Universal Testing
Machine. with these facilities, Laboratory scientists and engi-
neers conduct studies aimed at improving the hull structure
and increasing the resistance of the Navy's ships to enemy at-
tack. This requires development of fundamental, theoretll ap-
proaches of load and response, and development of engineering
solutions based on the increased understanding. A substantial
portion of the ship protection research is carried out at the
Underwater Explosions Research Division of this Laboratory lo-
cated at Portsmouth, Virginia.

® The ACOUSTICS AND VIBRATION LABORATORY was just
established to intensify research and development of ships of
improved detection capability, and reduced vibrations and under-
water sound output. Fundamental and applied research in hydro-
dynamics, structural acoustics, mechanical vibrations, and signal
processing are supplemented by conduct of acoustic and vibra-
tion trials, and development of acoustic and vibration instru-
mentation.

The OPERATIONS RESEARCH GROUP cannot be pinpointed
as easily because it ranges over all the RDT&E activities at The
Model Basin—hydromechanics, structural mechanics, aerody-
namics, and applied mathematics. Special applications today
are in the ﬁelds of naval architecture, ship silencing, ship pro-
tection, and weapons effects . . . setting realistic performance
goals for ships and submarines in view of probable environ-
mental factors . . . handling special externally-generated pro-
jects that tie in with DTMB capabilities . . . and making recom-
mendations to the Technical Director as to improving research
methods and orientation.

To staff these five operating Laboratories, we are seek-.
ing college graduates with BS, MS. or PhD degrees in
Aerospace, Electrical, Electronic, Mechanical or Struc-
tural Engineering: in Applied Mechanics, Mathematics.
Physics, and Naval Architecture.
