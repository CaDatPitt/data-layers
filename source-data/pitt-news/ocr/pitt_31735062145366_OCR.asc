Plan To Abolish
Student Council
Will Be Revealed

Success Of New Governmental
Unit Will Depend On Action
Of Present Legislature

A plan to abolish Student council
as it exists on the campus and to in-
stall a new governing group will be
revealed at the meeting of Student
council tomorrow night. The plan
has been one on which a faculty-stu-
dent committee, has been working
since the beginning of the semester.

Following a meeting of the faculty-
student group yesterday afternoon in
the office of Dr. Vincent W. Lantear,
dean of men, the approved form of
University student government will
be sent to council. It is expected
that following council’s approval,
elections to the new group will be
made this spring and the new form
of student government will go into
operation on the campus next fall.

Agitation for change in student
government on the campus came
about last semester as a result of
actions of several committees of Stu-
dent council, notably the actions of
the student relations group in the
Junior Prom affair, and the inactivity
of the trolley fare committee for re-
ductions in student trolley rates.

Activity on the part of the Pitt
News, the non-fraternity alliance, and
the new fraternity coalition brought
the situation to a head, Jack McPar-
land, D34, president of Student coun-
cil, appointed the faculty-student com-
mittee of 14 at the opening of the
current semester to change the Uni-
versity’s form of student government.

Although the exact make-up of the
new form of government and the
operations of the committee remain
secret, it has been reliably reported
that the group will present its ﬁnd-
ings to Student council tomorrow
night.

Hallock Discusses
Success of NRA

Speedy Recovery Anticipated By
Alumni Secretary

 

When the link between authority
and responsibility for the NRA can be
deﬁnitely cleared up, the NRA's suc-
cess will be deﬁnitely assured, is the
opinion of John W. Hallock, secre-
tary of the General Alumni associa-
tion, recently-appointed administra-
tion member of two code authorities
by General Hugh Johnson.

“Until such a time however,” he
stated, “its success will depend upon
the cooperation of the American in-
dustries and people." Hallock point-
ed out the danger from the 10 per-
cent of American industry that is not
under code regulation, and which can
by chiseling and other unfair prac-
tices nullify the efforts of 90 percent
of American industry toward nation-
al recovery.

On the question of code authority
and its constitutionality, he said,
“One thing they made plain to us in
Washington last week was that the
provisions of the NRA are constitu-
tional until they are declared uncon-
stitutional. “Of course there will be
a test case in the Supreme court con-
testing the validity of the NRA, but
I feel conﬁdent that the NRA will
triumph. When this case will ap-
pear I don’t know, but I don’t think
we will have long to wait."

Instructor of Political Science

At lea.st four distinct types of government may be found
in American cities today. They are: two kinds of mayor-
council government——strong mayor and weak mayor—commis-
sion, and city manager. Of these, the last named was the
latest to develop and is easily the favorite among students
of political science and advocates of municipal reform. This
plan originated in Staunton, Virginia, in 1908; and in 1914,
Dayton, Ohio, ‘became the ﬁrst city of importance to adopt it.
Since that time, it has spread until it is now in operation in
nearly 400 cities in the United States, ranging in size from
mere villages to cities like Fort Worth, Dallas, Indiana.polis,
Kansas City and Cincinnati. Many others, no doubt, would
adopt it if the laws of their respective states permitted them
to do so. Cleveland, to be sure, has abandoned it, as have a
few smaller cities, but of all those which change their gov-
ernments, more cities are now turning to the manager plan
than to any other.

City manager government may be brieﬂy deﬁned as that
form of municipal government in which both the legislative
and the executive powers are vested in an elective commis-
sion or council, while the functions of administration are en-
trusted to a manager, who is appointed by the council or com-
mission, and is responsible to it for the discharge of his
duties. Two types of city manager government may be dis-
tinguished, i. e., cominission-manager, and council—manager.
They diﬁer, however, only in the size and structure of the
elective or representative body. In the former, the commis-
sion usually consists of ﬁve persons elected at large in the
city by D0Dular vote. In the latter, the council consists of
nine or more members, elected either at large or by wards.

This distinction is of very little signiﬁcance, and no fur-
ther attention will be paid to it in this discussion.

As would be expected, the details of manager government
vary somewhat from one city to another, but its general char-
acteristics are alike: The voters of the city elect the mem-
bers of the council. The council then chooses one of its own
members as mayor, but he does not have the usual powers
of the mayor in non-manager cities. He presides over the
council as chairman, and votes as an ordinary member, but
does not have the power to veto ordinances and resolutions
passed by the council, and has little or no power of appoint-
ment. He is the chief dignitary of the city government, but
aside from his prestige, he has little more power than any
other member of the council.

The council, including the mayor, selects a manager, and
for this position it is usually forbidden to choose one of its
own members. It is expected that he will be chosen entirely
upon the basis of merit, without reference to his popularity
or his party affiliations. In order that the council may have
the widest possible choice in the selection of a manager, it is
usually provided in the charter that he need not, at the time
of his appointment, be a. resident of the city or the state.
Thus, the city is able to draw upon the talent of the entire

An Editorial -—----—---
I City Manager Government l

ITH MAYOR WILLIAM NISSLEY McNAIR’S admis-
sion that the administration of the affairs of the
City of Pittsburgh is far beyond his ken, and with the
subsequent furore in City Hall resulting from inadequate
leadership, agitation has been started to set up in Pitts-
burgh a city manager form of government. Newspapers,
civic organizations, and private citizens have been of late
interested in the possibilities of such government in this
city.

A thesis on the fundamental principles of the city man-
ager form of government today is presented by the Pitt
News. Roger V. Shumate, newly added to the staff of
the University from the University of Minnesota, is the
author of the article.

Students of the University should make the welfare
of the city of Pittsburgh their particular concern. Al-
though we do not advocate “active” participation of Uni-
versity students in the political affairs of the city, theirs
ought to be a service in line with the academic atmos-
phere in which they live.

Students of the University ought to know something
about the city manager form iof government. They ought
to know what it is, where  has been tried, and where
it has failed. They ought to be able to speak of its
advantages intelligently, and? if they are convinced that
Pittsburgh needs such a government, they could do well
to speak in its favor.

mitments, it is frequently found desirable not to appoint a
local man, even though there may be plenty of local talent
available. The most successful managers have not been resi-
dents of the cities which they served.

The manager, as a rule, has indeﬁnite tenure. That’ is to
say, he remains in oflice until he resigns or is removed by the
council. He is generally authorized and invited to attend
meetings of the council, and to make suggestions and recom-
mendations, but he has no vote. He is given unrestricted au-
thority to appoint and remove the heads of the several ad-
ministrative departments, such as ﬁre, police, public works
and public welfare. Although the council may remove him at
will, it is usually forbidden to interfere with his appointments
and removals or in any of the details of administration.

The advantages of city manager government, at least on

Political Scientist Describes Beneﬁts Of Manager Plan
For City Government; Points To Cincinnati As Example

the council acts in good faith, it will appoint a manager who
has already demonstrated his capacity as an administrator——-
not by his oratory, but as manager of another city, or in some
business or profession that ﬁts .him or his new position. A
manager selected on this basis will ﬁnd it to his interest to
give the city an efﬁcient and economic administration. He
earns his salary and keeps his job by producing results rather
than by “playing politics." This plan, it will be noted, sepa-
rates the function of legislation from the function of adminis-
tration, without destroying the ultimate power of the repre-
sentative council to control executive policy. This eliminates
the deadlocks which so frequently arise between the legisla-
tive and executive branches in the older niayor—council forms.
Since all the departments of government are subject to the
supervision of the manager, and since he, in turn, is responsi-
ble to the council, no other plan is so well calculated to pro-
vide harmony and cooperation among the several departments
and, at the same time, preserve the control of the council over
administration. If a head of department cannot or will not
cooperate with other departments and with the manager, he
must go. If the manager cannot or will not work in harmony
with the council, he must go. It is not necessary to await a
bi-ennial or quadrennial election for a "shake-up."

The objection to the manager plan which is most frequeiit-
ly voiced is that it is “un-democi'atic” or “un-American”—
that it concentrates too much power in the hands of the man-
ager, thus producing “one-man rule,” and rule by a man who
is not even chosen by the voters. This criticism, however,
is largely rhetorical, and often comes from politicians who
have an axe to grind——that is, t‘rom those who proﬁt by the
old system, and, for that reason, oppose any change. The
absurdity of their argument will be seen at once. By impli-
cation, they are arguing that the spoils system, and the cor-
ruption and ineﬂiciency which the city manager plan seeks
to eliminate, are not un-democratic or un-American, which
would be a painful admission, at best. Furthermore, the con-
tention that it is autocratic breaks down when we recall that
this plan does not concentrate any more power in the hands
of the manager than is wielded by the mayor in the strong
mayor type of government. The mayor, to be sure, is chosen
by popular vote, while the manager is not, but the mayor is
elected for a two or four-year term, and no matter how cor-
rupt, ineﬂicient or autocratic he proves to be, there is usually
very little that can ‘be done about it until the end of his term.
The manager, on the other hand, may be removed by the coun-
cil at any time.

One other objection, which is just as obvious as the one
considered above, is not so easily answered. The success or
failure of city manager government depends largely upon the
character, ability and personality of the manager, and the
support which he receives from the council and from the
people of the city as a whole. Undeniably, a small council is
better able to judge the qualiﬁcations of an administrator
than are the voters of a large city, but even the council may
make mistakes It is true that a mistake of this sort is more

‘ easily rectiﬁed than would be the case in the election of a

bad mayor, as the council can simply discharge the old mana-

McKay Advocates State
Tax Reform Amendment

 

Emphasizing the desirability of a
constitutional amendment to pave the
way for graduated inheritance and
income taxes, Dr. Marion K. McKay,

professor of economics, addressed the
Conference on Government held at
Philadelphia, Friday and Saturday,
March 2 and 3.

Dr, McKay, in his talk on “Thor-

need for improved assessment and
collection machinery and asserted
that the state should assume more
of the ﬁnancial burden of local gov-
ernment in order to relieve the burden
on real estate.

Although the convention, which
took place to discuss the desirability
of a change in the state constitution
of 1873, did not put forth any def-
inite resolutions, the consensus
favored a constitutional convention
to be called by popular vote.

Political Scientist Cites Merits,
Defects Of City Manager System

(Continued From Page One,)

ager and appoint a new one. All this,
however, assumes the right kind of
council. But if the voters have
chosen councilmen that are spoils-
men at heart, and who are more in-
terested in party politics than in ef-
ﬁcient administration, the purposes of
city manager government will be de-
feated. These men will choose as
their manager a local politician, or
one that will bow to their wishes.
Eiither by preference or necessity,
the manager will then “play politics.”
If he wishesto hold his job, he must
adopt the policies of the dominant
faction of the council, for, though the
council may not interfere directly, it
can discharge him if he is recalci-
trant. Thus, the evils of party gov-
ernment and his spoils system will
not have been eliminated.

The best example of successful city
manager government is undoubtedly to
be found in Cincinnati. Under the
old mayor-council plan, Cincinnati had
earned the reputation of being one of
the worst-governed and most thor-
oughly bo-ss-ridden cities in the coun-
try. Within a few years after adopt-
ing the manager plan, it could, with
some justification, claim the best
government of any city in the United
States, VVe must recognize, however,
that a mere change in form did not,
and could not, accomplish such a re-
sult. It had to be accompanied by a

The winners had a passing attack too

change in spirit. The city has had two
very able managers, but a large share
of the credit for their success must
go to the councilmen who appointed
them and gave them a free hand. At

the same time that the people of Cin- .

cinnati changed their form of gov-
ernment, they seem to have expe-
rienced a revival of civic interest and
civic virtue. At no time since the re-
form has the local Republican “ma-
chine,” the organization which had
given the city its evil reputation,
been able to control the council.
Through ﬁve successive councilmanic
elections, the voters have returned a
majority of members who were sym-
pathetic to the new plan, If, however,
they had returned the old organiza-
tion to power, by electing a majority
of “regular" Republicans to the coun-
cil, the reform would have been de-
feated at the outset. They would now
have the same old corrupt and inef-
ﬁcient government under a new
name.

The city manager plan has ac<l11it-
ted itself as well as could reasonably
be expected under the circumstances,
but it should be apparent that no form
of government will succeed of itself. Ul-
timately, it must depend upon a com-
posite of character, intelligence, in-
terest and “attitudes” on the part of
the people, as evidenced by the kind of
leaders which they choose to follow.

tact with students have given Dr.
Lanfear. He has taught four different
subjects in as many universities. Dur-

to 1918, he was instructor in military
aeronautics at the University of

the’ University. ‘ I
Dr, Lanfear obtained his bachelor‘

Texas, and next he went -to Columbia
in 1922 as an instructor in economics.
Front there he went to Yale as as-
sistant professor of political economy,‘
and from New Haven the University
of Pittsburgh called Dr, Lanfear to
its faculty as professor of ﬁnance, a
position which he held from 1924 until
this year.

the ﬁeld of education complete, he‘

A.-'I‘_exas ranch was Dr. Lanfear’s'

birthplace, and like most boys "of that
state he had to learn to ride a horse
as a part of his education. In fact,
he had to be able to ride before he
had his ﬁrst school lesson, as the
backwoods school where he attended
was ﬁve miles from his home.

As he galloped his horse to and
from the little building where he
learned “readin’. ’ritin’, and ‘rith-
metic,” the young lad probably never
dreamed that he would have the en-
tree into the many clubs and fra-
ternities to which he now belongs.

Mardi——Gras Fete
Changes Planned

Nationality Clubs Will Manage
Annual Colorful Affair

 

 

The Mardi Gras, colorful nation-
ality clubs’ dance, will be taken out
of student hands this year, announced
Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of
men, and Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitcliell, adviser of the nationality
clubs, yesterday.

This action came about following
repeated confusing announcements of
the postponement, cancellation and
other indeﬁnite reports of the annual
affair. Emeric Formichella, president
of the International council and chair-
man of last year’s dance, announced
that the nationality clubs which are
working for the completion of the
,Cathedral nationality rooms will take
lover the control of the Mardi Gras,

Although in many cases students of
the University are members of the
nationality clubs, th
be directed by students. Announce-
ment of the chairman appointments
and other plans for the dance will be
made at a later date by the ofﬁces of
Mrs. Mitchell.

THE PITT NEWS

TUESDAY. MARCH 13. 1934
{T4

Sportorial .

By Robert E. Badger
Pitt News Sports Editor

Baseball and Volley Ball
It has been suggested to this colum

n that if the University should decide

to sponsor two kinds of athletic teams not now on the school sports program

It should certainly be able to put out teams of championship caliber.

ball and volley ball are the sports in m

Base-
ind.

It is pointed out that Pittsburgh has always been a good baseball town.
Besides supporting a major league team the city is blessed .(or plagued) with

almost countless independent teams.

Right here on the campus there are

many good baseball players. The
football squad alone could furnish a
good team.

As for a coach we would not have
to go off the campus. In athletic tra.in-
er, Dr. George (Bud) Moore, we have
as good a coach as could be desired.
Besides be ing a crack ball player in
his day, the good doctor has coached
the Kiski prep school baseball team
among others.

There is, however, question as to
whether it would be advisable to
sponsor the diamond sport here. First,
there is the question of ﬁnding an
available playing ﬁeld. The Stadium
is unsuitable for baseball. There
might be a chance of getting Forbes
Field, but this, of course, would cost
money. However, some such ﬁeld as
Greenley Field might be available
for a small sum. Then, there is the
question of ﬁnance. It is extremely
doubtful if baseball would be a so-
called paying sport for at least two
years. Baseball equipment is expen-
sive, and whether or not the added
take from the funds devoted to ath-
letics would entail the curtailment of
the other sports should be considered,
Baseball was once on the athletic pro-
gram at the University but the inter-
est shown did not. justify keeping it
there. Perhaps, interest in the sport
has been revived. Perhaps it has not.

The matter of a volley ball team
is much more simple. V-Vith this, there
is virtually no expense. This year
the AAU national championship tour-
nament takes place at the Irene

Kauffmann Settlement ‘House, Entering ‘

a team in this would not cost any-
thing, Just fora start, the Pitt team
would have Garcia, Taylor, and Lasky,
all freshman basketball players who
are also expert at volley ball. This,
national tournament which will take;
place in Pittsburgh attracts nation—,’
wide attention. Besides providing as
much good as any other sport, should
the Pitt team make a good showing.
as it in all probability would, the
University would get some verygood
publicity. -

Another sport about which there
has been some talk is lacrosse. Sev-
eral Pitt students have approached
the-manager of Motor Square Garden
regarding the chances for forming_ a
team and getting’ in some practice
sessions. Nothing deﬁnite, however,
has come of this.

If enough interest were manifested,‘
something might be done about get-
ting these sports here at the Uni-
versity. How about it?

Pitt Bits——M;an-Mountain John Va-
lenti, Pitt lineman of a. couple of
years ago is back in school this semes-
ter. He will be eligible for football
next fall. A new tackle. maybe? . . .
Football assistant coach Bill Kern is
never without chewing gum . . . Alex
Muzyk, freshman swimming star, IS
also a member of the Panther football
squad According to current
rumors Temple is going to have quite
some football team next year. Last
year’s freshman team there is report-
ed to have defeated the varsity con-
sistently in practice sessions . .

. . Carnegie Tech should also have
a very nice football team next year
what with that very good frosh team
of the past season . . . It is reported
that Cheeso Onder’s brother, Jean-
nette High School star halfback, is
going to Ohio State next fall, paying
practically no attention to the fact
that Cheeso came to Pitt and Angelo
to West Virginia . . . There is plenty
of good Cap and Gown material on
the swimming team, Russ Lindberg
and Hymie Adlersberg are tap danc-
ers, Joe Madden can really sing, and
Joe Schmeiler can hit the ivorles
Charley Junge, Joe 0rsini’s bantam-
weight, has dropped out of schoql.
He has secured a job. \/

Mile Relay Team
Sets New Mark

Coach Olson, whose success with
mile relay teams is little short of re-
markable, appears to have another
great quartet of runners available for
that event this season. Although two
members of last year's crack team
were lost through graduation, Olson
has gathered together another quar-
tet which looks like a champion out-
ﬁt.

These four boys, Fred Kiger, Bill
Keller, Charles Great, and Harold
C-Onnelly teamed up at the Central In-
tercollegiate conference indoor track
and ﬁeld meet Saturday to furnish
the high spot of the meet by crack-
ing the conference record in the mile
relay. The Panthers clipped a full
second from the mark established by
Notre Dame in 1932. The time for
the Pitt runners was three minutes,
24 2-10 seconds.

Other Panthers to gain points in
the two-day meet at South Bend were
Pelucha, Bonavita, Fleming, and
Guay. Pelucha took a second place
in the pole vault event, Bonavita cap-
tupred second in the 16—pound shot
put, and Fleming ran second to Ralph
Metcalf, “the world's fastest human,"
in the 60-yard dash event. Jimmy
Guay accounted for the other Panther
point with 3, fourth place in the 60-
yard high hurdles, ,

The Pitt team gtood third in thel
total point standings with 141,5
points. Michigan State, with 321/2
points, and Notre Dame, with a total
of 21%, led the Panthers,

Olson will have another week in
which to train his trackmen before’
they pack up and leave again for the
west to participate in the Armour
Tech relays in Chicago, Saturday.

 

Swimmers Take

Third In E S A

An exceptionally strong Rutgers
swimming tea.m won the Eastern
Swimming association championship
for the third time in three years in

 

the championship meet which took

place in the Delaware university pool
on Saturday. Rutgers scored a total
of 40 points which was considerably
higher than the scores of its nearest
rivals, New York university and Pitt.

The ﬁght between New York and
Pitt for second place was rather
close. In the ﬁnal count N. Y. U had
21 points to its credit and the Pan-

Golden Cats Finish

Regular Season

Tomorrow With Western Reserve

 

The Golden Panthers will be out for their thirteenth straight win as they
ring down the curtain on their regular season’s schedule tomorrow night at
Cleveland against the Western Reserve quintet.

The Red Cats have had potentially powerful ﬁves for the last several
years and Pitt fans will never forget the surprise victory which the Cleve-
landers handed out to the Panthers in game played as a part of Doctor Carl-

son’s ﬁrst basketball clinic.

Pitt had an off night last year when the Western

Reserve men came to town but man-6

sloppy exhibition to win out over a.
strong Cleveland team,

Reserve had two brilliant men on
the ﬂoor that night, Finnigan and
Bernwald, but graduation has swept
away most of last year’s Reserve
power. The Red ‘Cats aren’t to be
counted out of tomorrow's game how-
ever. A ﬁne victory over their bitter-i
est rivals. Case. last Saturday nightl
may have put the Cats in a ﬁne moodl
for a taste of Panther blood. '

‘Concluding their activities in the
Eastern Intercollegiate conference,
the Panthers eked out a close win
over the greatly-improved West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers at Morgafntown
Saturday. Pitt wound up with an un-
blemished record in eight games
while the Mountaineers held on to
second place in the league standing-
