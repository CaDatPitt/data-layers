High School Girls Still

 

Invading S U Dances

Debra Meyer, chairman of Student Union dance com-
mittee, announced that checking of student invoices at the
SU dances has not curbed the inﬂux of high school girls at-
tending them. The main problem seems to be that not
enough girls who live in the dorms attend these affairs.

It was discovered last year that many high school girls

were coming to the SU dances, so’

this year they instituted the sys-
tem of checking invoices before
letting any student enter.

High school girls are able to get
in by waiting outside the Ball
Room and then asking a stag‘ to
take them in as their dates, in
some cases they even pay their
escort their share of the tiéket
pl‘lC€.

One of the reasons the Uni-
versity. wishes to discourage
high school girls from attending
the dances is that all the Uni-
versity students are covered by
insurance, but should one of the
high school students get h;-rt it
could create complications and
possibly involve legal
against the University.

action

The main problem remains to
encourage more co-eds living in
the dorms to attend these dances.

Watery ‘West V

Members of the Dolpl:in Club
effectively presented their inter-

pretation of t h e well-known‘
Broadway s h o w, “West Side
Story,” before a crowded audi-

ence of students and friends of
the swimmers. The show took
place last Wednesday at the YM-
YWHA pool.

The musical started oif on a
peppy note when members of
two New York gangs, the Jets and
the Sharks, were engaged

bers was helpful in uniting the
show, although it was difficult to
hear at times. A

Excellent Timing

Timing and co—ordination in the
swimming solo by Nancy Burton

ing before a dressing table. Hu-
mor was added to the show when
she was pulled into the water,

mers in the number.

Costuming and the use of
props such as knives, large hair
ribbons, and maracas added
beauty and comedy to the num-
bers. Diane Colgan, Bonnie

handled the lighting well.

In the ﬁnale the majority of
the swimmers did nothing but

De-fining’ Values . . t

ers pective

Academic P

 

, which are imposed onstudents

Whether a course is -in the lower schools or in
college and the graduate schools, its primary value
is instrumental‘. I can see. no more sense in telling
a person that the reason why -he is studying two

‘foreign languages is to improve his mind than there

is in» telling a carpenter that the
reason why he has -to ‘learn to
saw a -straight line is to improve
his "mind. You learn a language
in order either to speak or read
it, and it is sheer mystiﬁcation
to try to endow the ‘procedure
with some higher value.”

I believe that the same is true
of thoseone-year science courses

in the humanities and the social
sciences. How eloquent profes-
sors get when they declare that no one can be
educated today who does not know’ something of
science! Wh.en.you ask them what‘ the something
is, they‘ treat ‘you as if you are suffering from ar-
rested development.,What can you learn of any
science in the usual introductory course in physics
and chemistry? You do not even learn how to
solve a simple problem experimentally. No one
ever says to one of these students, “Here is a pro-

blem in chemistry; how would you devise an ex-_

periment to solve it?” On the contrary, the labora-
tory manuals have the experiments all ‘laid out
and the student is told what problem each is solv-
ing. Even in mathematics, which is the biggest
magic of them. all, the student is first told how to
solve certain types of problems and then is given

problems of the right type to solve by the method
taught him.

Science —Maiors Understand

The majors in the sciences are not fooled. They
know well enough that these one-year courses are
preparatory for the more advanced courses. If
they do not, all they have to do is to look at the
college catalogue and they will see that Chemistry I
is a prerequisite for Chemistry II and that Chem-

when the poor oaf from the humanities ‘is dragged
protesting into the lab, he is told that he ,is,b<:ir,ig
initiated into one of the major mysteries of modern
civilization and that the country "needs more sci’-
entists to beat the Russians. " Y

. None of this denies that any course, however
instrumental in purpose, may also have what philo-
sophers might call.termina1' value as well. There
are people who like elementary mathematics,
laboratory chemistry and physics, English com-
position,
like all kinds of things. If they have a good time
doing what is devised to prepare them for some-

thing else, so much the better. I am told that it 

‘amateur actors enjoy acting, though surely no one
enjoys watching them perform except for psycho-
logical reasons. And it is ‘impossible that dentists
enjoy inflicting- pain. One can never tell about
such things. The point of all this is that such

race and need not be given as the justification for
such studies. Their justiflcationais instrumental and
whatever terminal value they have is a by—product.

Must Step Somewhere ,
But“ after all one cannot go on forever ﬁnding

newer and newer goals for college courses ‘to at- s

tain. Sometime or other one has to come to a halt,
I suppose, and say, “This is it; I can now read
Virgil with my feet on the desk and that’s good
enough for me.” Or, “Now I have found a formula
for the distribution of the prime numbers and I’m
a real mathematician.” It is true that no one actu-
ally ever stops until his body gives out, and each
new resting place is just _a breather.,But one does

not know that. Learning is like the drug habit: .

the more you give in to it, the stronger its hold on
you. But my point is that the value of these things

is in the things themselves and is determined by‘

the individuals engaged in them and not by others.

  On Sensitivity

A With the possible exception of the word “in-
tellectual,” our coveted term “sensitive” has, been
misused and misinterpreted more than any adjec-
tive in the English language. It has, "in fact, been
kicked about and trampled into the dust to such
an extent in recent years that
the word can rarely be applied
to anything nowadays‘ and still
have any meaning. pi

Today, when one is accredit-
edwith a high degree of sens-
itivity, he is admired, almost
revered. To be sensitive, it
seems, is to be special, to be
above the mass, to be almost
holy. To say that one is sens-
itive -is tosay that one holds the
innate capability of opening all
the doors of life.

And all of the above statements are quite true.
But itlcan be shown, however, that being sensitive
is not a quality to be admired for itself.

According to the Scrabble guide, sensitive is
deﬁned as “having quick and acute sensibility
either to the action of external objects or to the
impressions upon the mind and feelings . . . highly
susceptible; easily and acutely affected . . .”

For some reason, the person who ‘reacts to life’s
experiences with a high degree of such sensitivity
is placed upon a pedestal in our society; viewed
with a rather worshipping attitude. But sensitivity
is a common commodity, and if a person is born
with a sensitive nature, he certainly deserves no
credit or admiration for possessing it.

‘Communication’ is the word

Rather, it is what the individual does with’ his
gift that qualiﬁes him for any=possible praise. To
be sensitive is one matter, but to express that sens-
itivity in some manner which can be communicated
to others is the praiseworthy element of the in-
dividual’s life.

The expression of the results of one’s» sensitivity
is, of course, art. All great painters, sculptors,
writers, poets, actors, composers or musicians are

 

NS and. « ultimately, —0urselveg

 ’ -By Matthew Nesvisky

individuals who are born with the ability -=— the
talent -+ of expressing their superior degree of
awareness to the world around them through some
means of communication. The results of their ef-
forts to communicate. their feelings become the
timeless treasures of the world.

The quality of sensitivity, ‘therefore, should not
be admired if it is not coupled with. the desire and
ability of truly expressing its reflections. But for
some inexplicable reason, it consistantly is.

v For example, I was recently engaged in a light
conversation with a friend who was describing an
acquaintance with whom I was not familiar.

“He’s absolutely wonderful!” she emphasized,
rolling back her eyes.

Curious as to what criteria my friend used to
arrive at such a judgment of this individual, I in-
nocently asked her to explain.

“Oh, he’s so sensitive 2?? came the speedy answer.

Still Curious, I pressed for a- definition.

,“Well,--he’s so . . . so . . . so Holden Caulﬁeld !”
my friend intoned with obvious self-satisfaction.

Nothing More ~

And that sums it ‘up. Indeed, the fictional life-
guard in the ryeﬁeld is presented as a youth of
extremely high sensitivity.,But nothing more. Our
admiration should be directed to J D. Salinger, not
to his protagonist, for it is the author who has the
acute awareness of life coupled with the talent to
communicate it: the ability to produce creative art.
Holden is indeed sensitive, which is more than can
be said for most people. But still he owns only half
of the necessary equipment to merit our respect.

Salinger, on the other hand, is an example of
an active creative individual; in short, an artist
The St0Py he has presented is a moving one; a sad-
flmny, beautiful—ugly piece of art. This should be
Our object of our respect, as it is the product of the
whole, creative man.

we can also lose the meaning of the other essential
element, talent. If this occurs, we can lose ur art-

By ‘M.-vrriiiazw‘ NESVISKY

W°1’k- Such, 3 book iS_‘Kéni Kesey’s One Flew Over the
Cuckoo’s Nest (Viking Press; 311 pp.; $4.95).

Written in -a ‘terse but even present tense, the novel is
the first person account of an inmate of an Oregon mental

,inst.itut.ion. The narrator, “.Chief”¢

Bromden, is agigantic, half—breed
Indian who, during his
years in the ward, has passed
himself off as a deaf—mute.

As a literary device, Bromden
is perfect for revealing
building action of the plot. As he
pushes his broom and mops
through the halls of the sani-

tarium, his own personal neuroses.

color his reflections on the other

inmates and their conﬂict with

the administrators of the institu-
tion in a nervously exciting man-
ner.
Two Protagonists

This conflict is culminated in
two protagonists. The first, the
Big Nurse, is seen through Brom-
den’s unbalanced mind as the
most prominent ﬁgurc in the en-
tire machine-like world which
persecutes him. The other is Mc-
Murphy, a recent arrival .to the
ward who is considerer a “po-
tenti-ally dangerous psychopath.”

But McMurphy, another per-
fectly drawn character, appears to
be such a normal bird in this
cuck0o’s nest that his presence
is almost frightening. A big,
brawling, brash lover of life, this
itinerant gambler quickly deter-
mines that the inmates are being
subjected to unnecessary cruelty
by the Big Nurse and decides to
do something about it.

Being no altruist, however, he
makes a game of getting the
Nurse’s administrative goat-.
Given incentive by side bets
with the other patients, he then
begins a running battle of wits.
For a man who is supposed to
be incapable of ‘such warfare,
he proves himself a calculating,
clever combatant.

Through the drama of his story,
author Kesey poses several pro-

the old riddle of who is really a

BLOODTHIRSTY GARY

Pitt’s monstrous tackle, Gary Kaltenbach, 6-2, 240, crash-
ed into another equall.y-monstrous tackle in a spring football
practice drill the other day. The two human depictions of
the Colossus of Rhodes toppled earthward with a thud.
Snorting like an asthmatic rhinoceros breathing out his
life, sorely wounded, Kaltenbach ‘sounded a mournful strain.
A bearded Bohemian, in purple beret and washed-
out blue denim pants, observing this sadistic clash, low-
ered his dark shades, and looked around with swim-
*ming eyes. “By God,” the poet cried mockingly, “they’re
animals.” ’
Fortunately, the clash of arms and the groans of the
‘falling drowned his cry, and he walked away unharmed in
search of a lyrical guitar. And Kaltenbach snorted ever the
. louder. ‘ ~

Wants To Excel .
“Gary wants to excel,” says Coach John Michelosen.
‘ “He’s a hard worker. He has a real good attitude towards
spring practice. Even though he’s asenior, it certainly doesn’t
look like he’s a senior.

_ ‘fln as far as he’s the ﬁrst on the ﬁeld at practice. He has
the potential to be a real great performer.”

-a hungry sophomore, eager

so hard. “There’s.no game to look to on Saturday,” Gary re-
marked. “The initiative has to be in one’s self. A sophomore
has a lot more initiative because he’s new and he’s starting
at the bottom and tryinghto work his way to the top.

“The reason I work so hard even though I was a
ﬁrst-stringer last year is because I worked very hard to
get to the top. of the ladder and I’m not going to try and
‘work my way back down it again.” .

For Kaltenbach this daily toil is worthwhile, “It's a time
for relearning fundamentals,” he exclaimed. “No one knows
it all, and the coaches are always coming up with new ideas.
You don’t have time to learn it all in the fall.

“It seems different this year,” he continued. “There’s a
lot more spirit and everyone seems younger. I _don’t know
if it’s because I’m just getting older or what. They seem to
have a lot more get up and go.

New Coaches Generate‘ Spirit

“Spirit has been generated by the new coaches, Mr. Hef-
ferle and Mr. Lauterbur,” Gary added. Frank.Lauterbur is
a former Army aide who is handling the tackles at Pitt this
season. ' * _ ,
Of Gary he says, “I’ve been very pleasingly impressed
with Gary’s work. He shows leadership that you hope a
good senior will show. He’s a good model for young kids to

excel.” _

_ Commenting on his all-out efforts in the often list-
less spring sessions, Lauterbur said, “I always had felt
that this was in him. He was one of the ﬁnest high school
prospects I’ve ever seen. He has the ability to be an All-
American if he desires it‘himself——he has the ability.”

, When Mr. Lauterbur tells me, I did something good,”
Gary said, “it’s good. If he says ‘bad,’ then it’s bad. He doesn’t
tell you lies and you know exactly how you stand with him.
Right now I feel like I’d run through a brick wall.for him.”
No such‘ histrionics were staged, however, but Kalten-
bach was convincing. “I’d just like to have a real good year
' and go to a bowl. We can have an outstanding year and go
to a good bowl. I just hope we do. I’ve never been in one
since I’ve been here. ,
“Personal-wise, I want to play good enough to be

Competition Stiff At lst ,

Base On Baseball Nine

By BOB SMIZIK

A converted outﬁelder and two promising sophomores
should make the ﬁrst base position a spot that will give
Coach Bobby Lewis little to worry about.

The former outﬁelder is co—captain John Ciofﬁ and he
will hold down the initial sack until now freshmen Brian
Fisher and Barry Wetzel are eligible to play.

Cioffi was used primarily as a
right fielder by Lewis last year
and occasionally played first base.
Another outfielder, Jack Giarusso,
had been tried at first, but ac-
cording to Lewis, “Cioffi can adapt
more readily to the position since
he has played it before.” '

Fisher or Wetzel

As soon as April 26 rolls around
and the freshmen become eligible
Cioffi will more than likely give
up his infield duties to either Fish—-
er or Wetzel.

“Both boys have been whack-
ing the ball pretty well and
right now I’d have to say it’s a
tossup to see who is the start-
er,’f said Lewis.

, Competition between Fisher and
Wetzel is nothing new. While
Fisher was playing first base and
starring on the basketball court
for‘Peabody High School, Wetzel
was doing the same for Allder-
dice, a long time rival of Peabody.

The friendly rivalry continued
on this year’s freshman basketball
team and should grow even strong—
er on the baseball squad.

Could Platoon

The fact that Fisher is a left
handed swinger and Wetzel is a
right handed batter prompts Lewis
to consider the possibility of pla-
tooning the two newcomers.

“I’d don’t like to platoon,” the

‘ Coach stated, “but if I find it to
our advantage, I won’t hesitate
‘ to do it. Usually the reason a
left handed batter can’t hit a left
handed pitcher is because he’s
never had the opportunity to
swing against. them. 1

“I think if a lefty batter gets -
plenty of chances to hit against
southpaw pitchers, chances are
that he’ll be able to hit them as
well as righties.”

Lewis has not discounted the

as
Wetzel at the same time. “If they
both continue to hit as well as they
have, I might use one of them in
the outfield. They’ both V have
shown they can do a creditable job
out there,” Lewis said.

This type of healthy competition
prevails at almost every spot on
the team and should help to mak
the squad 9. big winner. *

Meetingrl Probes Community

Social Worli
Grads Confer

Willi Faculty

The Univers-ity’s Graduate
School of Social Work held its
Eighth Biennial Conference for
Alumni and Faculty last Saturday
in the Student Union from 9 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. The conference theme

‘was “Redefining Social Work in

Response
lenge.”
Bernard Schiffman, executive
secrtary for Recreation and In-
formal Education of Metropolitan
Chicago‘s welfare council, was the
principal speaker. Professor Elea-

to Community Chal-

nor Cockerill, professor social

. / '
casework, was the conference‘
chairman.

Schiffman conducted the session
on leisure activities and their re-
~la.,tionship to problems of unem-
ployment and the potential shorter
work week. About 159 social
workers attended the sessions and
discussed public health, public
welfare, use of leisure, and educa-
tion.

To Supplement Urban Renewal

There "is, as yet, no adequate
provision for social service to ac-
company the u r b a n
efforts which now are combatting
50 years of urban decay, accord-
ing to recently released informa-
tion. Shiffman said.

O Presently, 100,000 workers are
being automated out of jobs
each week (many of them never
return to work again); 450,000
children are uncared for while
their mothers work; almost ‘half
the country’s hospital beds are
.occupied by mentally ill.”

In the ﬁeld of public assistance,
Secretary of Health. Education,
and Welfare, Abraham Ribicoff,
has called for more preventive
and rehabilitation services.

a program at present results in

highly endowed but are unable

With this View in mind, the

CRAM COURSE N0. 1:
MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY

The school year draws rapidly to a. close, and it's been a fun
year, what with learning the twist, attencling public executions,
and walking our cheeta.hs-but are we readylor ﬁnal exams?
Some of us,/I fear, are not-. Therefore, in these few remaining
columns, I propose to forego levit-y and instead offer a series
of cram courses so that we may all be prepared at exam time.

We will start with Modern European History. Strictly de-
ﬁned, Modern European History covers t-he history oi’ Europe
from January 1, 1962, to the present. However, in order to
provide employment for more teachers, the course has been
moved back to the Age of Pericles, or the Renaissa.n.ee, as it is
jocularly called.

\The single most in1port:mt fact to relnember about Modern
European History is the elnerg;ence of Prussia. As we all know,
Prllssia. was originally called Russia. The “P” was pu1‘(.~.hased
from Persia. in 1874 for $24 and lVl:l.nha.tta.n Island. This later
beearne known as Guy Fawkes Day.

Pr-.r':~;ia, without a “l”' was, of course,.called Ersia. This so
eml>a:rrassed the natives that they changed the name of the
country to Iran. This led to a rash of name clialiging. Mesopo-
tamia became Iraq, b‘L=hleswig—Holstein became Saxe—(‘ol)urg,
Bosnizl-Herzegovina beraine (Heveland. Tliere was even talk in
stable old Engzlllnd about rhamrzilig the name of the country,
but it was lorgotten when the little princes escaped from the
Tower and set fire to Pitt, the Elder.

turn now to thatvevcr popular lavorite, l*‘1'a'nce.

lf'i':lnce, as we all know, is divided into several departmental.

  

There is the Police Department, the Fire l)epartment, the
Gas and Water Department, and the Bureau. of Weights and
Measures. There is also Madame Pompadour, butithaft need
not concern us because it is a dirty story and is only taug.>:ht to
graduate students. ‘

_ Firially, let us take up It-aly-tl1e newest European nation.
Italy did not become _a uniﬁed state until 1848 when Garibaldi,
Cavour, and V ictor~Emma.nuel threw three coins in the Trevi
Fount-ai.n. This lovely gesture so enchanted all of Europe that
William of Orange married Mary Stuart and caused a potato
famine in I reland. This, in turn, resulted in Pitt, the Younger,

All of this may seem a bit complicated, but be of good cheer.
Iilverything was happily resolved at the Congress of Vienna
where lvlet-ternich traded Parma to Talleyrand for Mad Ludwig
of Bavaria. Then everybody waltzed till dawn and then, tired
but content, they started the Thirty Years’ War, @ 1932 Mu Elllulrnan
