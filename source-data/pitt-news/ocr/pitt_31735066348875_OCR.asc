Counseling and Placement

‘BY GARY LAMPENFELD

The University counseling and
placement services have merged
into one department, the Univer-
sity Counseling and Placement
Center, which will be headed by
former Counseling Director Robert
Gallagher.

The merger, which took effect
following the death of Placement
Director Ernest Holmok, came
after a year of planning ‘and
development by Vice-Chancellor
for Student Affairs’Alfred Moye.

. “There’s been interest for a long
time in merging the counseling and
placement centers,” Gallagher
said, adding that he currently is
searching for an associate director
to oversee the Career Life Planning
Program and Placement Center.

According to Gallagher,‘ the
counseling psychologists in ’ the
three ‘programs’ of the former
Counseling Service will extend
their services into Career Develop-
ment and Placement. “The value
of this type of merger,”

' . j'“‘Sallagher, “is that we don’t lose

the input of our counseling
psychologists."

One advantage of the consolida-
tion is the greater feasibility of
shifting functions from counseling
to placement, and vice versa.

A An example Gallagher cited is
the possible transferring of the
credentialing service, which writes
letters. of recommendation, from
the counseling center. to the

' placement center, an area he feels
is more appropriate.

In Moye's view, the greatest
advantage is “having career life
planning ‘where the counseling
psychologists can participate.” He
plans to correlate the program with

said '

the combining of the Career Life
Planning program and the ‘place-
ment center. '

Moye said the only disadvantage

is the physical arrangement of the
offices and libraries, which he felt
could be remedied through minor
ienovations. There are presently
separate counseling and placement
libraries.

“Other than a problem of
space,” Moye said, “there have
been no administrative, philo-
sophical, or political problems. I
have heard of no resistance (to the
merger).'’ ;

A spokesperson for the Office of
Student Affairs said it probably
would cost less to operate the
merged offices than it. did to
operate the two offices separately.
No cutbacks in student services are

expected.

Some results of the merger will
be a cooperative education pro-
gram in which participants work at
curriculum-related jobs, and 'a
greater effort by the placement
center to help liberal arts majors
ﬁnd meaningful employment.

Many undergraduate students at
Pitt. especially those in the College
of Arts and Sciences (CAS), are
receiving inadequate eduacations,
Assistant to the Dean of CAS Jack
Daniel reported at Monday’s
Student Government Board (SGB)
meeting. —

Daniel said he was concerned
about the number of undergrad-
uates at Pitt who are being “used
and abused” but who are not
getting an education.

“Since 1963 to the present, the
University of Pittsburgh has gone
through great changes in the kind
of students it ‘has recruited,”
Daniel said. “We’re bringing in
more women, blacks and ﬁrst

generation university scholars to
Pitt than before, but our teachers ‘

are 'not prepared to teach them.”
Daniel‘ said he came to these
conclusions after reviewing studies
he had performed in his own
classes, surveys of graduating
students, and personal.contact with
several Pitt students and teachers.
Daniel said he hoped to study the

‘problem more closely -and bring it

to the attention of_ more people at
Pitt.

‘‘We’ll have to go, about this.‘
slowly,” Daniel warned, “because

this is a problem that has occurred
over time. It’s going to take some
time to correct it.”

According to Daniel, the Univer-
sity has had to admit more minority’
and underpriviledged students
since it became a state-related
school. These students, Daniel

said, often are not prepared for -

college-level work and cannot get
much‘ out of the traditional
education at Pitt. ,

Too many professors, he said,
cannot adapt their teaching
methods to accomodate the special

Pill PoIice,Nc1b Rope Suspect

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Campus police arrested a sus-
pect Friday in charges stemming
from a reported rape in Schenley
Hall Friday evening. -

The suspect, a 20-year old
Homewood man, is being held
pending a hearing before" _‘a
magistrate on charges of rape and
assault. .

RENOVATION continues in the Tuck Shop, with the familiar benches
and tile making way for a fast-food franchise scheduled for opening in
fall term. All that remains now are the murals at either end of the

cafeteria and a few scraps of pipe and wood.

According. to Campus Police
Chief Curt Graham, the suspect
sought refuge in the women’s room
on the second ﬂoor of Hillman"
Library.

“We receivedia complaint from
the victim, and whenever some-
thing like this happens we send
officers to all the nearby build-
ings,”_ Graham said.

“The suspect waspicked up on a
description, and he has been
charged with rape, assault and
trespass.”

Now in the custody of the city
police, the suspect is awaiting
arraignment today before a magis-

,trate.

According to Graham, the
suspect was not a Pitt student or an
Oakland resident.‘

“We can’t release all the
details,” Graham said, “because
obviously we don’t want to affect
the ruling of the court.”

Graham noted that the police
department has detained suspects
in every recent violent assault on

“There are no uncleared rapes

before this summer's Hillman

on the decline.”

Ex—Chcmice||oir Kurtzman 
To Head iNew Pitt Office,-

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

.In an effort to provide the state
administration with complete in-
formation and research capabilities
on matters pertaining to education
and related subjects, Pitt has
recently established the Office of
Commonwealth Research and Ser-
vices (OCRS). '

0_CRS’s major function is .to
answer the questions the legisla-
tive and executive branches of the,
state government may have about
the cost and effectiveness of
postseeondary education, espe-
cially when they apply to budget
planning. _

The office, charged by Chan‘-
cellor Wesley W. Posvar last
March,j is headed by Pitt’s
Chancellor Emeritus David Kurtz-
man.

According to "Kurtzman, OCRS
will provide much of its information
to Pitt’s Office of Governmental
Relations. headed by Russ Arnold.

 

Too many Pitt students are receiving inadequate educations, 
Assistant to the Dean of CAS Jack -Daniel told the Student Government

“The University,’ ‘is using_ these
kids to fill its clas‘srooms,”, ‘Daiiqieli-.,-,
said, “It owes them a quality
education they can use.” . -

. After hearing Daniel, the board ,
unanimously agreed to help him if;

the fall and winter terms, pro.-.

In other action, board member ..
Steve Tarnockrefused to comply‘
with a motion requesting his
resignation. The motion had been, 1
passed 4-1. . _ - 
It came after several" board. 
members charged that Tarnock had
not performed the minimal duties
required of him or demonstrated
any committment to do so since the
beginning of spring term. ‘ E -

“If Arnold’s ofﬁce has a specific‘

Pitt or education in general,”
Kurtzman said, “he now has an
entity he can turn to’ for -the
information.” _ —

Previously, Kurtzman noted, the , 1
Office of Governmental Relations‘ ‘
often had to bargain for appropria- 
tions in Harrisburg without com-
plete factual knowledge" or statis- g
tics on possible program alterna-, 
tives. » » ' ' ,

Kurtzman added that OCRS; .
would look for new areas to ; ' ,
research on. its ‘own and also" 
research specific‘ problems for the
state for the Governmental Rela-
tions Ofﬁce.

‘-‘We'll probably look into full,
state financing of public schools."
Kurtzman said. “-We're also ~
encouraging faculty members to. _'
suggest new studies and provide 
studies already available for 
0CRS." .

Most of the research provided by

the same grants and remenerations
with which other University pro-

Other board members include
Arnold, Senate Council President
Frank Slaughter, Associate Provost
Joseph Shoben, Chairperson of the
University Senate’s Common-
wealth Relations Committee
Andrew Blair, and the deans of six
of Pitt’s professional schools.

Tentatively, OCRS will meet on

installed, students will be able to
dial one number to hear a recorded

Schwarz reported that the sevice

Captain Fantastic and the Brown
Dirt Cowboy, Elton John, MCA.

BYTOM WASELESKI

Elton John’s latest album spec-
tacular Captain Fantastic and the
Brown Dirt Cowboy, is an exercise
in excess, a panorama of perver-
sity. And yes, you‘can tell a book
(in this case, a record) by its cover.

The album is not all that bad. It
shows a new direction for this
too-often "glittered up band. .
Though the package is a bundle of

-commercial overkill (a poster, an

illustrated lyrics booklet, a scrap-
book of rare and early Elton photos

the sounds on Captain Fantastic.
The only major problem here is
one of balance. Too many of the’

‘songs are over-dramatic to the

point of funereal somberness. The
AM * radio stations already are
destroying the first single off the
album, “Someone Saved My_Life
Tonight,” and the FM stations
aren’t far behind. The song itself is
monotonous, which only makes
overplay more painful to the ear..
In this respect, Captain Fantastic
has at least one thing going for it:
“Philadelphia Freedom” is not
part of the album.

Allegedly autobiographical, the
songs’ lyrics are not as solid as
those on former albums. Bernie

the meticulous - depiction of two
local boys looking for the proverbial
break into fame and, alas, fantasy.
Though we’ve heard the story too
many times before, one would
think Taupin’s proven ability with
words would somehow carry the
endeavor through. It doesn't.

The ﬁnal cut on the record,
“Curtains,” is a post‘ facto
reflection from atop the hard-won
ivory tower, and in a way the song
says something about the current
state of the John-Taupin art:

“There’s treasure children always.

must have had a once upon a

there it was that Elton John wrote
