Debate
begins
over SGB
violation

By Steve Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

The debate whether Student ’

Government Board President-
elect Ross Pasquale should
resign his new position has
begun.

“Ross Pasquale cheated,” SGB
member Tony Moody said, “and
I think the students deserve bet-
ter.”

Current SGB President Jacob
Brody was upset with the con-
troversy and Pasquale. “In any
office, if you break rules in
attaining the office, how can
people trust you?”

A Support for Pasquale has
come from the Resident Student
Association, the Black Action
Society and several board-elect
members. .

“He made a mistake,” Meg Ott
of Resident Student Association
said in support of Pasquale. “But
there are a hell of a lot worse
mistakes. Something as minor as
this doesn’t need to be blown
up into a major political issue.”

In a prepared statement,
Pasquale responded to Moody’s
and Brody’s comments by say-
ing, “I definitely think a great
deal of bitterness is informing
the comments made by a ‘num-
ber of individuals who have a
vested interest, and this lack of
objectivity should be considered
when evaluating the validity of
their comments.” A

Pasquale was found guilty in
"an SGB Elections Committee
hearing last Thursday of actively
campaigning within 100 feet of
the Sutherland Hall polling
booths. Two Sutherland Hall
poll workers witnessed the
infractions and reported the vio-
lations. The SGBEC imposed
sanctions that Pasqua1e’s 76
votes from Sutherland Hall be

Man with portable heart-assist system in

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

A 57-year-old man who received the first
battery-powered, wearable heart-assist sys-
tem in the area was upgraded to fair condi-
tion yesterday by doctors at Presbyterian

University Hospital.

This is only the second time the highly
portable Novacor left ventricle assist system
has been used in the United States. The
New York resident, who suffered from end-
stage heart disease, received the implant

last Tuesday.

“We expect him to leave the [intensive
care unit] today,” University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center spokesperson Frank
Raczkiewicz said yesterday.

The wearable pump is temporarily
installed to perform the pumping for the left
ventricle, the heart’s primary_ pumping
chamber. It maintains circulation by‘reliev-
ing the weakened heart of its full workload
until the patient can receive a heart trans-

plant.

The new system, developed by Baxter
Healthcare Corp., uses the same pump

SGB asks
for fee
increase

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

In response to the increasing
number of student organizations
at Pitt and the costs involved
with their programs, the Student
Government Board recommend-
ed a Student Activities fee
increase at its weekly meeting
Friday. The resolution will now
be reviewed by the administra-
tion.

“The number of student
groups has increased by 41 per-

cent since the last increase of the '

fee,” SGB President pro tempore
Ted Schroeder said. “[The
increase] is necessary for and
beneficial to the welfare of the
undergraduate population.”

The fee will be raised from $32
to $40 for full-time students and
fro_m $10 to $12 for part-time stu-
dents, according to the SGB reso-
lution. A

The resolution, which is a rec-
ommendation to the vice-chan-

A cellor of Student Affairs, was not
’ supported by the entire SGB.

“No, no, no, a thousand times
no,” SGB board member Tom
“Students are

Mysterious raves becoming more /enown in Pittsburgh

The. abandoned warehouse
hides on the outskirts of
McKees Rocks. It sits alone

among long-abandoned apart-A

ment buildings and old
foundries. The average person
would not even notice it with-
out the help of specific direc-

tions that have been left on the
answering machine of a local
record store.

The parking lot is dark,
except for the three cars whose
headlights have been left on
deliberately. Their lights are
the only things that allow other
drivers to see the ﬂocks of peo-
ple trekking toward the ware-
house.

There are no lights around
the building; the windows have
been painted black. Nobody
can see what is going on

inside.

Just the way they like it.

Hundreds of young people,
high school and college stu-
dents who shun the usual
keg scene, congregate there to
forget about the world for
awhile.

Fifty thousand watts of com-
puter—generated music, known
as Techno, pounds out of the
speakers at a frenetic pace of
160 beats per minute while
people dance, feet planted, tor-
sosundulating, arms ﬂailing

wildly over their heads. Their
dance style reminiscentof ‘70s
Disco. ' ' _

Others watch “with blank
stares at an upside—down
projection of the Rocky Horror
Picture Show or the design
images created on the
wall with the use of lasers.
Some step up to the “energizer
bar” for bottled water or a com-
bination of fruit. juice and
amino acids known as “smart
drinks.”

Smoke generated from dry

ice machines clouds the room.

The thick film masks the"

collage of expressions,

from somber faces with heavy‘

brooding eyes to agitated,
explosive faces ready to
detonate at any given sec-
ond during the very long
night.

Raves

Continued from page 1

can last a fortnight. —- Jean ‘

Cocteau

If you have not heard of
raves or cannot seem to find
out where they are, that is pret-
ty much the point.

The all night dance-a-thon
thrives on the ambiance
of secrecy thatfeeds college
students to the underground
cult. I

Raves epitomizes the nation-
al disenchantment with the tra-
ditional, the conventional, the
conservative, the status quo —
whether it be music, politics,

social issues or mom and dad’s '

taste.

Their hipness, spontaneity
and allusion to revolution
entice young people to commit
to the ministry or rave.

At a shallower level, rave can
also be seen as a genre of
music heavy on pounding
rhythms, that puncture the
body in a convulsion of sound
— demanding to be felt, rather
than heard.

The many styles of music

I include House, a mostly instru-

mental dance music that
was first played at warehouse
parties (hence the name). It
is similar to Disco but juiced
with up-to—date electronic,
computer-generated
rhythms. House music is slow-
er than Techno, but not by
much. 0

Acid Jazz, ' a slower
more soulful dance music,
is also produced by electronic,
computer-generated rhythms;
but it is laced with the sounds
of actual jazz instruments
such as trumpets or saxo-
phones.

Ambient House is a mean-
dering, meditative, electronic
music that allows the dancers
to chill out from the exhaustion
of physically demanding, non-
stop, all-night dancing.

The many styles of music, in
addition to their different
intensities, allow rave D.J.’s to
administer an assortment
of music that keeps the cult
of ordained ravers dancing
until the wee hours of the
morning.

By thought I embrace the
universal. — Blaise Pascal

One l‘ﬂV€l"Sl T —shirt says it all:
‘-‘BREAK DOWN THE BARRI-
ERS.” ,

- Although rave’s main ideolo-
gy is an attraction to the 1960s
message of peace, love
and happiness, a subculture
exists that abuses psychedelic
substances to attain this feel-
ing of inner peace and outer
love. _

Raves are often illegal affairs,
running one step ahead of the
law. .

The two main “mind-
expanding” substances of
choice are LSD and Ecstasy.
Both are synthetic, mood—alter—
ing, provide long-lasting rush-
es and are easily obtainable at
raves. I

LSD breaks down thought V

barriers and expands con-
sciousness. Ecstasy provides an
instantaneous. feeling of
euphoria, the drug eliminates
any sexual inhibitions and is
thought to provide an eight-
hour bodily orgasm. V

dance,” said Pittstudent and

kind of hard to ignore others
around you tripping on Ecstasy

rand LSD, poisoning their

minds.”

I Solot said he left the rave
scene because of the drug
abuse that took place there.

“It is really scary,” he said.
“People would practice sex,
often times unsafe, in this
place called a chill-out room
where people tired from danc-
ing would go to rest. ”

“Raves are this huge drug
fest, some people go their just
to get high, the lyrics of many
rave songs glorify substance
abuse. The amino acids in
‘smart drinks‘ enhance and
intensify LSD trips.”

Others, however, disagree.

“That’s not all—together true,”

said a Pitt student and raver,
who wished to be known only
as Bleeb. “People at raves do
drugs, I will not argue with
that, but a lot of people come
down just to have ‘a good time
and forget about things for a
while.” ' '
. According to Detective
Renee Kacsuta of the
Pittsburgh Police Narcotics
Division, a first—time offender
arrested for selling LSD can
serve from 18 to 30 months in
prison. First-time offenders
arrested for possession of LSD
can serve from 12 to 24 months
in prison.

which ran in yesterday’s
The Pitt News.

At Friday’s SGB meet-
ing, poll worker Laura
Auerbach read a state-
ment citing Pasquale’s vio-
lations and calling him a
“cheater.” “I’m not saying
[Pasquale] doesn’t deserve
the presidency,” Auerbach
told The Pitt News. ‘‘I just
think that a stronger
penalty should have been
taken.”

"SGB members—elect Eric
McKinley and Deena
Buchanan said that all the
candidates were in viola-
tion of the 100 feet rule.

“I don’t think it’s fair to
single ‘ Ross out,”
Buchanan said.

“I still think he’s the 

most qualified candidate,”
McKinley said. “The per-
son who got the most
votes won. That should be
the end of it.”

Buchanan and McKin-
ley also said in support of
Pasquale that bitter feel-
ings and ulterior motives
may have led to the
VSutherl_and Hall violations
being the only ones
reported. “If Ross had
come in third, and some-
one else had won, would
these complaints have
been filed?” McKinley

also said, “I still find it peculiar
that I was the only candidate
charged with this violation con-

sidering successful and unsuc—_

cessful candidates were also vio-
lating this and other articles of
the code.”

Chair of the BAS Keith Davis
said he supports Pasquale but he
also supports the sanctions.

“This is one of those things
that happens,” Davis said. “But
it's taken care of now.”

According to Auerbach, stu-
dents can start a petition
demanding Pasquale to resign as
president.

Doug Herman, an election
opponent of Pasquale, said
Pasquale should not be presi-
dent because he has lost credi-
bility of the students, assuming
that Auerbach’s statement at the
SGB meeting is true.

 . “Ross deﬁed an elections com-
mittee person. He should be

» eliminated,” Herman said. “He

broke the codes. It’s not about

giving him another chance.”

Brody, who has had several
controversies of his own as SGB
president, said Pasquale has
“diminished people’s trust in the
office of president and the SGB
as a whole.”

“If something like this
would’ve happened to me, I
would resign the position,”
Brody said. “Especially when
you look at the fact that he’s not
in office yet, and the office of the
president has already been dam-
aged.” .

“If students feel he should be
president, fine. The ultimate
decision lies with the students,”
Brody said.

Moody, who ran against
Pasquale for president in last
week’s elections, slammed
Pasquale for running a dirty
campaign while saying the other
campaigns were legitimate. “I
think that this shows the moral
and ethical character of Ross,”

Moody said, “that I think he por-
trayed during the election.”

“Someone who is dishonest
and unethical does not deserve
the office,” Moody said. “I didn’t
cheat at all. I ran a fair campaign
and I think that the others ran a
fair campaign. But it makes me
wonder, in a fair election, what
would the results have been?”

“I don’t believe that my moral
character is in question because
I made a mistake,“ Pasquale’s
statement said.  I was warned
once and complied with my
warning."

Several Pitt students expressed
mixed reactions to the situa-
tion.“This doesn’t affect my
opinion of him,” first-year stu-
dent Tony Ferrante said. “But I
think it was the right punish-
merit.”

Fii'st—year ' student Amy
Rosenberg said the results of the
hearing have not affected her
opinion of Pasquale and she still
tiusts him to do a good job.

Continued from page 1
we have to make sure the
money is being spent wise-
ly.”

S_(_?;B President Jacob
Brody said students should
take a rational view of
the situation.

“A lot of people will be
opposed to a fee increase
based on an immediate,
emotional response th-at is ‘I
don’t want to pay more
money,” Brody said.

“People say Student
Government Board spends
money here and there  but
were spending money for
student use.”

“All groups have had a
decrease in funds,”
Schroeder said. “We’re not
entering [the motion] irra-
tionally or irresponsibly.”

According to Joe Cavalla,
director of Student Activities,
the fee has not been raised
since 1987.

“Since 1987, student
groups have increased from
[76] to 106,” Brody said.
“And by the time the new
president takes office in
January, there will probably
be 10 more.”

Joyce Giangarlo, SGB
advisor, saidthe fee increase
will help the /SGB successful-
ly address the program

requests which come
before the Allocations
Committee.

“Every five years there
tends to be a fee increase,”
Giangarlo said. “We try to

make the most of what
we have, but things get
tight. Right now we have
more groups and more
expenses than we’ve ever
had before.”

Schroeder said it is impor-
tant for students to realize
the fee increase is not giving
more money to the SGB,
but making more funding
available to student groups
and student programs. Last
week, Cavalla said an
increase in the fee would not
change the process which
groups must follow to
receive funding.

“There are guidelines and
procedures used to fund
organizations and [the
Allocations Committee]
sticklsl tightly to them,”
Cavalla said.

According to Brody,
Allocations doesn’t currently
have the funds available to
adequately address the
needs of student groups.

“Increasingly in the past
couple of years, there’s been
a trend forthe Allocations
Committee to nickel and
dime student organizations,”
Brody said. “And that’s
unfortunate.”

According to Brody, cam-
pus organizations such as
the Resident Student
Association, the Black Action
Society and the Engineering
Student Council have all
experienced decreases» in"
funding and/or programs in
the past year.

Oregon Senator Robert Packwood was about to
resign his seat in the Senate in order to keep his
diaries, which were subpoenaed by the Ethics
Committee, private. But when the Justice Department
decided to conduct a criminal investigation, Packwood
chose not to resign because his diaries could still be
made public.

According to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,
Packwood decided to remain in the Senate so that he
would “have a better forum to defend himself.” The
Republican Senate leaders have promised to support
Packwood in his defense.

The New Yorle Times reported that Packwood
became the subject of a criminal investigation after a
senate debate revealed that Packwood had asked
Steven R. Saunders, a former aide, to find employment
for Packwood’s ex-wife. Packwood was already under
investigation for allegedly making unwanted sexual
advances toward female staff members. This is why
the Ethics Committee issued the subpoena for

" Packwood’s journals.

Packwood should follow through on his intent to
resign from the Senate because of his lack of integrity
and horrific mistreatment of women. His own con-
stituents are picketing him at home, and the New Yorle
Times reports that some senators«“turn their backs
when he walks onto the floor.” This damages the
effectiveness of our government. An investigation con-
ducted in the Senate will merely create another
unneeded circus in Congress, which will also be dam-
aging. Stepping aside now will prevent unnecessary
mudslinging. ‘

However, the decision to subpoena Packw_ood’s
diaries is an example ‘of_ government overstepping its
bounds” . .

A person’s privacy must be respected.’ The
Constitution guarantees the right of citizens, even
those accused of violating ethics codes and mistreating
women, to keep their personal property, including
personal papers, secure from unreasonable search and

seizure. This right applies to Packwood along with .

everyone else. If his diaries are examined, the idea of
American civil liberties becomes a joke.

The investigation’s tactics belong more to the
Orwellian “Thought Police” than the American Justice
system. _ .

The line must be drawn. If Packwood resigns, those
who have grievances against him can pursue them in
court and not across the Senate ﬂoor, tying up mem-
bers of Congress in the Ethics Committees hearings
and testimony. Packwood should simply step down
and pay for his atrocious misconduct.

He does not deserve a seat in the Senate, but he still
ideserves the civil liberties everyone is guaranteed inl
the Constitution.

Over the river and through Pitt

Just look around campus.

Leaves are providing a wonderful cascade of
color as they fall to the ground. Students are
scurrying around, cramming for those last-
minute, just—before-the-holiday exams that all
professors find necessary to squeeze in under
the guise of being kind to the students.

Some Pitt students, who are filled with

thoughts of wolﬁng down plates upon plates of ‘

home—cookin’, are already homeward bound
besieging the huge charter buses parked along
Bigelow Boulevard.

It is time once again to put away those petty
grievances, don our biggest holiday smiles, and
call to mind what we, as Pitt

Thanks to SGB President pro tempore Ted
Schroeder’s efforts, eleven months into his term,
for speaking up and proposing a fee hike.

Worried Pitt students will now be able to sleep
at night, knowing that an extra $16 may be
going to suchjworthwhile endeavors as The
Prisoner Club, Some of God’s Children and
HEMP.

Campus buses which drop students off in a

different area code than their apartments.

Thanks to the wonderfully planned—out bus stop
placement, Pitt students will find peace of mind
in knowing that if they survive the five.-block

and their apartment after
dark, they will have reaped
the benefits of their security
fee.

-First'one up to bat:

SGB: Thank you Ross; Pitt K ,
is not Pitt without a little tinge of controversy
surrounding the SGB president. At least Jacob
Brody had the decency to let the muck start fly-
ing after he took office. We have to admit Ross,
you are holding true to your campaign promises
of “creating and maintaining constant dialogue
with Pitt’s governance groups.” Just try to stay in
the positive light, buddy.

-Next item up for bid:

What time is it? No Pitt student better be ask-
ing that question around the William Pitt Union.
No Pitt student better ask how much the new
clock costs either, ‘cause no one is telling. We
do want to thank the SGB for getting one tangi-
ble project accomplished. We’ve always wanted
to tell time from the 37th floor of the Cathedral
of Learning. '

-Next item up for bid: _

Grade point averages: These averages, normal—
ly surrounded by anxiety, are rising to astronom-
ical levels on campus. For this, we owe our
thanks to the Pitt football team’s less than stellar
record this year. _

Security at Hillman has been beefed up and
season passes are now being traded for library
passes on campus. Seems that the time allotted
by students to attend or watch football games on
Saturday afternoons has been converted to study
time at the libraries.

°Next in our cornucopia of things we’re
thankful for:

The new, improved Student Activities Fee.

°Next on our list:

The panhandlers which
line Forbes Avenue, particularly in the evening
hours, who for some reason don’t seem to think
students need any of that “spare change.”

(Can you say “laund1y”?). Thanks for being
there to remind us that it is impossible to take a
quiet, undisturbed walk at the end of the day in
Oakland.

°Over in this corner we have 

The Cashier’s Office in Thackeray Hall. Thanks
to the pleasant, understanding staff in the
Cashier’s Office, who constantly remind students
that they should indeed work full—time for four
years before attending Pitt so they can avoid the
financial aid process.

-Also 

What the ‘&/\%!! Another parking ticket?
Thanks to Pitt police who are always ready to
give you a parking ticket, courtesy of the

. University of Pittsburgh. Such a shame they can

never give directions to a parking area that is not
fully occupied. Hey! tow—truck man! Come back
here with my car!

-And finally 

Bureaucracy.

We, the students of Pitt, should bow down
and worship at the feet of the bureaucratic gods,
who rule our university with a resounding effort
to facilitate the implementation of the guidelines
and in triplicate parameters  er  something
like that.

BAY, NOVES M BER 23,1993 

The irony in the debate over
racial and cultural “diversity”
on campus is that its propo-
nents don’t really believe in it
themselves. It has turned what
could have been a positive step
toward easing race relations
into probably’ the ultimate
example of “political ‘correct-

~ ness,” andlfind that sad. 9

Diversity has become -_a bad

joke. And, for the most part, ,

the black students themselves
are to blame.
A few weeks ago, there was

a segment on 60 Minutes’

which dealt with race relations
on the campus of Duke
University, and the show made
it clear that the only reason it
Visited

"I attended a conservative white

were willing’ to’ ’talk‘."~ The
reporter expressed surprise that
black students kept to them-
selves and even tried to dis-
courage ’a black student from
pledging a white fraternity.

I wasn’t at all surprised. I
have always found it practically
impossible to find black stu-
dents on this campus outside
of the black cultural groups.

 nature.

Some of those same people
complain that the rest of the
campus hardly notices them —
or worse, that the campus is
hopelessly racist and there’s no
point in trying to relate to
those who, “don’t really want
us here.” The trouble is. that

} they display the exact same
4 attitude’ that they accuse others
‘ of having toward them.Let’s be

truthful. Blacks are t as racist as
anyone else. ,

The first thing that we need
to understand about racism is
that it has absolutely nothing to
do with emotions and every-
thing to do with perception.
And anyone who tells you that,

. blacks are incapable of racism

simply has no clue as to its true

church and its ancillary acade-
my; I was one of only a hand-
ful of blacks (and the only

black male) in my class. I had ,

been taught that those white
folks didn’t really 1ike_me
because I was black. Well, they
didn’t like me all right, but it
had more to do with my atti-
tude than anything else.

I came across these two
Sunday School lessons. One
featured this cartoon figure say-
ing that, “all are liars,
dirty, etc.” Well, I filled in that
blank with “whites.” I immedi-
ately thought, “Wait a minute,
something.is wrong here  I
couldn’t possibly be a racist.”

Then I saw a cartoon, which

Rick
* ~ N owlin

posed the question: Suppose a
black family moved into your
neighborhood. What should
you do? The choices were: 1)
Put up" your house forsale; 2)
Stay but pay no attention to the
new neighbors; or 3) Invite
them over for coffee. Of

' course, the answer was No. 3.

At that point, I decided that
maybe I was the one who
needed to change — so I made
a point to refrain from calling
my classmates, their parents
and the teachers racists. and to
try to get to know them a little

bit. I finally realized that “either
these people are sincere or
they’re pulling off one phe-
nomenal con job.” Since then, I
have called no one a racist
unless that person says or does
something which leaves no
doubt. '

I have found that a surprising
number of whites have little, if
any, experience with people of
different races and thus cannot
understand the corresponding
cultures. (This is especially true

outside the South). If there is a‘

perception of racism on the
college campus, it can be
directly attributed to a lack of
knowledge — it isn’t really
hate. What is happening with
the culture of militarism on the
part of a number of black,stu-
dents is that it actually drives
everyone away. Do the stu-
dents at the University of North
Carolina really believe that
putting the black cultural cen-
ter in the heart of the campus
will win them respect? Get a

_life! Remember the “water buf-

falo” incident at the University
of Pennsylvania? I’ve always
wondered why most people
have ignored the real issue —

 Dz'versz'ty, unfortunate example of political correctness

why the black sorority sisters in
question were making enough
racket that late at night to
cause a disturbance.

What’s even more disconcert-
ing is that, often, relating to
whites on an intimate basis or
expressing viewpoints other
than the ‘-‘accepted” one can
get blacks in trouble. I know
that from experience, as I have
caught all kinds of hell for
even having whites as friends.
By the time I came to Pitt, I
had had enough of being
thought of as an “Oreo cook-
ie,” so I avoided black groups
altogether; and eventually
joined, a white fraternity.

I would not suggest that
racism is a dead issue. If black
students want to promote
“diversity,” they should recog-
nizethat each person is an
unique individual and ought
not to be stereotyped to justify
a certain political agenda. The
civil rights movement wasn’t
really about rights; it was about
reconciliation, and without rec-
onciliation, there can never be
justice.

Letters to the Editor

When we look back at the Student
Government Board’s actions of this
past year one thing will stand out:

I lack of fiscal responsibility. But this is
not fair to the whole board, since one
individual deserves most of the blame:
Jacob Brody. Not only has this presi-
dent spent our money unwisely, he
does not seem to care.

His administration has been tainted
with irresponsibility from the begin-
ning. While we looked for edible food
in the cafeteria, Brody munched on
lobster at a four star hotel. Now we
have a tremendous clock which we
had no voice in purchasing. Everyone
we have talked to would rather‘ have
fees decreased than a big clock on
campus. -

Brody doesn’t care about money.
This must hold true for all people
born with a silver spoon in their
mouth.’ Student Activities fees will be
raised, which is understandable con-
sidering more groups want money.
Brody commented, “always when you

SGB President Brody a spendthrift

start talking about money there will
be an outcry  40 bucks just adds up
to two weekends of partying,” (The
Pitt News, Nov. 18, 1993). To many
people “~40 bucks” means more than
“two weekends of partying.” We
understand why this fee should be-
raised, but is it too much to ask for a
little compassion when fees are
raised? Our “outcry” is that we want
our student government to care about
finances and not associate fee increas-
es with partying.

The only good point is soon other
characters will run the show. We
hope they are more responsible and
compassionate.

It is too bad the clock doesn’t have
the date on it, because then everyone
would know that hopefully a new
time has come. What the clock really

needs is a window counting down the V

days left in Brody’s presidency.

Feminism says rights aren't radical

Feminism is getting a bad rap. The
Campus Women’s Organization is
experiencing the detrimental effects.
Signs for our meetings do not remain
hanging for more than a fewlhours and
negative publicity deters people from
our meetings.

Just what does feminism mean? It
doesn’t mean that women have to be
exactly like men. It,doesn’t mean that
all men are evil. The feminist move-
ment does not insist that [its] members
agree with all of its tenets.

Feminism is choice. Feminism chal-
lenges gender stereotypes and attempts
to break barriers. Under feminism,
women can choose to devote their
lives to motherhood, a career, or both.
Feminism lets a woman choose
whether to have a child and makes
sure that women have the rights that
all humans deserve. This is why many
feminists choose to be called human-
ists.

Why is all this such a radical idea?

To this day women only earn 69
cents for every S1.00'earned' by men.

Sexual assault has increased dramati-
cally and estimates say that one in four
college women will be raped. The right
to have a safe, ‘legal abortion is con-
stantly in jeopardy.

Meanwhile, the average woman is 5
feet 4 inches and 120 pounds while
our “role models” average 5 feet 10
inches and 115 pounds. These images
perpetuate the epidemics of anorexia
and bulemia. .

Campus Women’s Organization is a
feminist organization. We are here to
change society’s standards so women
are respected for their accomplish-
ments. Campus Women’s Organization
is for all women whether they are short
or tall, skinny or fat, black or white,
business—oriented or maternal (or
both), pro-choice or pro—life (or both),
and whether they wear lots of makeup
or are currently dieting. If you can
identify with at leastuone of those
issues, maybe CWO is for you.

It should come as no surprise to Pitt foot-
ball fans that a strong game from Curtis
Martin was behind Pitt’s 28-18 victory over a
lackluster Temple team on Saturday. After
the game, Martin reflected on the 1993 sea-
son in which he ﬁnished as Pitt’s top rusher
and reception leader.

 everyone knows, we are in a rebuild-
ing process,” Martin, a junior, said. “This
win will allow us"to go into nextseason
with some confidence.”

Martin surpassed the 1000—yard mark in
rushing for the season in the fourth quarter
with an 80-yard run, a play that Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors _said “couldn’t have

come at a better time” in a game which Pitt _

needed to win.

“There’s nothing like winning, especially
the last game of the season,” Majors said.
“It’s a lot more fun to go into the holidays
and recruiting with a victory under your
belt.”

Majors said he was proud of Pitt’s come-
back victory on Saturday, a game in which
they had rallied from a 10-point deficit early
in the game. '

“We’ve done about as well as we could in
terms of our win—loss record this season,”
Majors said. “Two of our three wins were
big upsets and we came close one other
time.”

Quarterback John Ryan said the signifi-
cance of Pitt’s win was in how they» won the

game. , t _

“We made some mistakes early in the

game but showed we could move the ball
down the ﬁeld,” Ryan said.

“When those mistakes were corrected, we

scored.”

Ryan admitted it was “an ugly game,” but
said the most important thing was Pitt’s vic-
tory, the third of the season.

Junioripoint guard JerryMcCulloughisPitt's soul in the hole

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

 

greatdeal of the success

» of the 1993 Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team will rest on the
shoulders of junior point guard
Jerry McCullough.

Last year, McCullough came
out from under the large shad-
ow _cast by previous Pitt point
guard Sean Miller to become the
quintessential ﬂoor general.

McCullough, a 5—foot-11-inch
junior from New York, NY,
averaged 15.3 points and 5.6
assists per game in 1992-93.

Pitt’s up—tempo style of game
fits McCullough’s physical
attributes perfectly.

With the speed of a cheetah,
McCullough runs the open court
to lead the Panthers’ attack. Like
a hawk, “he views the entire
court — always looking for the
open man.

On offense, McCullough’s pri-
mary responsibility is to get the
big guys up front to the ball.

Heading into 1993-94, consis-
tency will be the big question
facing McCullough.

With the ear1y—season flashes
McCullough showed last sea-
son, teams changed their
defenses in order to stop him in
the later parts of the season.

“lLast season], the other teams
started throwing two guards to
defend me, and it threw me off
my game a little,” McCullough
said.

This season, the Pitt point
guard will take a prominent role

Jerry McCullough inherited the starting point guard job
from the graduated Sean Miller a year ago. last season he
led the Panthers in scoring and to an NCAA bid.

Tony Frorrnrl/The Pitt News
Curtis Martin's 1000-yards rushing ended the season on a positive note. .— .

"We've -had a rough season,” Ryan'_'_said.'.
“‘Next year everybody will know their _

assignments because of our experience

with this offense and hopefully we’ll get a

lot of recruits.”

Majors, who has emphasized the impor-
tance of recruiting all season, said Pitt needs
help in a few areas.

as a team leader.

“I try to lead by example and
not show anyone up. If some-
thing needs to be said I’ll pull
the player aside and talk to him
confidentially,” McCullough
said.

McCullough’s skills did not go
unnoticed last season by the
basketball community -
“Petersen’s College Basketball
Preview” voted McCullough as a
first team All—Big East selection.

During the off—season,
McCullough primarily worked
on improving his outside jump-
shot. With a strong and consis-
tent season, this could turn into
a break-through year for
McCullough.

McCullough’s goal for this
season is short and simple.

“I want to try and play the
perfect game every night,”
McCullough said.

How far the Panthers go this
season may be proportionate to
the type of season McCullough
has. _

Translation? McCullough is
the spark plug of the 1993-94
Pitt Panther basketball team.

If McCullough can raise his
game to the next level and
inspire his teammates to do the
same, an NCAA tournament bid
is a strong possibility this sea-
son.

But if McCullough slows
down during the second half of
the season, the Panthers could
be sitting at home next March,

PHILADELPHIA — Anyone
who thinks that _Pitt football is in
bad shape should
have been at the
Vet Saturday to
view the disaster
more commonly
known as Temple
football.

The statistics are
downright embar-
rassing. The Owls
gave up an average
of 49 points per
game while scoring
less than 10 them-
selves. Opposing
offenses averaged a
whopping 512 yards
a game against the
Owls swiss cheese
defense. They had a
1-7 record in the Big
East.

Even worse ‘than

atmosphere at the

have averaged a

year,” Dickerson said. -“1993
was a tremendous learning
experience for the fans, the

-Youth.

— Saying that Temple is a young
team is an understatement.
Eight true first-year students
have started for the Owls‘.
Dickerson played 39 first—year
students and sophomores last
week vs. West Virginia. A total
of 25 players have made their
first collegiate starts and the
depth chart regularly includes
as many as 25 first—year students
and sophomores.

You can’t expect to win regu-
larly without experience.

With the young players get-
ting so much playing time, there

upsets next year.”

-Veterans Stadium.

It’s at least a half hour from
Temple’s campus. There was no
student section visible Saturday.
While it’s true that fans don’t
Win games, it’s nice to have a

full stadium. A home field‘

advantage is an integral part of
college football. The Vet is prac-
tically a neutral site. It would be
in their best interest to find
another place to play.

0 Lack of fans.

Less than 6,000 showed up.
It’s been like that all year.

“I’ve been disappointed with

accomplishments
because there aren’t many. He
is forced to tell prospective
players that they are “starting
history.”

Solving all these “problems” is
vital to a successful program.
Winning a few games is a Short-
term solution; a winning atti-
tude that Dickerson must instill
is the long-term answer.

Temple is a long way from
being a good team.

Dickerson is doing his best
with little money, no fans and
poor facilities. You have to
respect this man.

Coach Majors has it easy.

Annual
Blue/ Gold
track meet
ushers in
‘93 season

On Saturday the young
men and women of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
track and field team par—
took in the eighth annual
Blue and Gold Meet at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Blue and Gold
Classic is an inter-squad
meet where the men’s
and women’s programs
combine into two teams
for the first unofficial
meet of the year.

“The biggest thing I see
is [that] the team members
have been a pretty close
family unit, but even
more so this year,” Steve
Lewis, head women’s and
men’s sprint and hurdle
coach, said.

“Everybody uncler—
stands .and respects every-
body. This is evident in
the way everybody roots
for each other.”

In this, the first compe-
tition of the 1995-94 sea-
son, Pitt showed talent,
experience and mental
toughness.

The teams broke six
Blue and Gold records as
well as one school record
as the blue narrowly
defeated the gold with a
score of 99-92.

The highlight of the day
came when sophomore
Tonia Malloy out—duelled
rookie Angie Martin in a
heated 600-meter race.

As Malloy crossed the
finished line, she discov-
ered that she had shat-
tered Ardythe Hope’s
school record that had
stood since 1990.

Malloy had a blistering
time of 1:319.

The old record was
1234.9.

“I really wasn’t thinking
about the record,” Malloy
said. “I was just there to
improve and develop my

skills. Time is not a reﬂection
of my goal for this season.”

Martin also surpassed
Hope’s in the record books
with a time of 1:34.8.~

Martin wasn’t the only new-
comer to have a fantastic day.

First—year athlete Jerel
Williams also provided a
spark as he showed excel-
lence from 55 meters to 600
meters. At the meet’s end, the
high school All-American
walked away with two first-
place finishes to go with a
third-place and a meet record.

Williams nipped senior
Brian Whitley at the tape to
win the 55 meters with a time
of 5.4 seconds.

Three events later, Williams
broke the meet record in the
600 meters with a winning
time 1:235.

“Even though I never ran

the 600, I attacked it,”
Williams said.

“I was disappointed with my
time. I believe I can run a lot
faster. My major goal is to
make the'NCAA’s as a fresh-
man. ~
Najuma Fletcher and Allison
Williams also provided a
spark as they both broke their
own Blue and Gold records.

Fletcher, a second-year per-
former who in high school
competed in the ' 1992
Olympiad for her native coun-
try of Ghana, broke the high
jump record that she set a
year ago.

Last year as a rookie,
‘Fletcher jumped five—feet~
eight-ninths-inches.

This year she bettered it
with a jump of ﬁve-feet-nine-
inches.

The two-time record holder
feels that personal records are

D

okay, but that the overall per-
formance of the team is more
important.

“When I break five-ten,
then I will be pleased,”
Fletcher said. “We have a lot
of runners coming back; we
should be better than last
year.”

Allison Williams, who was a
major contributor to last year’s
team, tied her Blue and Gold
record in the 50-yard hurdles
with a time of 6.4 seconds. 3

Williams, a two-time All
American and defending Big _
East champion, has another
year of eligibility despite
graduating last year with a
degree in exercise physiolo-
gy.

Williams is psyched up
about another shot at the
national title in the hurdles.

“My personal goal is to win
the national championship.”

“[We need] speed, size,
strength, quickness and smarts,”
Majors said.

“We have a few players that
have done a good job for us this
year, but we need support for
those players and competition
at every position.”

Tom Tumulty, who finished
the season as Pitt’s leader in
tackles, said winning the last
game of the season was impor-
tant for several reasons in addi-
tion to recruiting.

“We’re going into winter “con-

ditioning and spring. practice

with a‘ good taste in our mouth,”
T umulty said. “It’s also nice to
see the seniors go out as win-
ners.”

According to Tumulty, who
said the difference between
winning and losing is “incredi-
ble,” winning is also important
due to its effects on a team’
morale and attitude.

“[When we lose], I don’t want
to go outside or talk to any-
body,” Tumulty said. “Now I
can enjoy the off-season with a
better attitude.”

Wide receiver Curtis
Anderson said he wasn’t happy
that the season was over, and
that he is looking forward to
participating in next season’s
games. —

“This has been a frustratin
season,” Anderson said.“We
were not always doing what we
were supposed to be doing out
there. Next year, we’ll be more
familiar with the offense and
already have at f_our_1d_ation_in
place.” _ . _

Hayes Clark, a Pitt linebacker
and native Philadelphian, said
he was glad that Pitt made a
statement during his return to
Philly.

“We proved thatwe could
come back,” Clark said. “I didn’t
play as much as I did in some

other games, but I’d always
trade that for a win.” '

Defensive
Moody who halted a Temple
drive with a fourth quarter inter-
ception off a tipped pass said
that “we did enough to win.”

“At the beginning of the sea-
son, we weren’t predicted to
win any games,” Moody said.
“We won two big games and
won this one.”

Playing in his last game in ‘a
Pitt Panther uniform, senior
Doug Whaley said his career at
free safety for Pitt “has been
great.”

Whaley said he was especially
glad to be part of Majors’ build-
ing of a foundation for Pitt foot-
ball in the future.

“All things must come to an
end,” Whaley said.

“This season has been up and
down, but it feels good to end
with a win.”

immediate savings to student cardmembers. You can save up to 26% on long distance calls versus AT&T
