In contrast to the com-
plaints of student apathy
mentioned by many of the
candidates in their plat-
forms, students turned out
in larger than ever numbers
yesterday to support their
favorite candidates in the
election for the 1994 Student
Government Board.

“This election seems to
have a much higher turn-
out than last year,” Heather
I-Ieinrichs, a poll worker
in the William Pitt Union
said. J

“I think it’s because more
candidates are running.

.Students have more to

107 additional students.

poll booths located in the

to last year.
“Obviously, it is a reﬂec—
tion of the high number of

candidates,” SGB advisor

Joyce Giangarlo said.

“It has been the most
active and emotional cam-
paign,,tl,1at I’Ve seen in my
fourteen years here,” she
said. —

Last year, two students ran
for SGB president and 10
ran for board. This year, six
students ran for president
and fourteen ran for board
positions.

Since 1985, no more than
two candidates have run for
the SGB presidency and in
the past three years no more
than 10- candidates have
vied for positions on the
board.

“The race has been very
heated this year, especially
for president,” said Marcie
Wolfe, a poll worker who
said the Sutherland Hall vot-
ing booth was busy most of
the day.

SGB to vote on Student Activities fee increase proposal

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

In light of the recent increase in the

number of student organizations-

demanding funding, Student
Government Board has initiated a reso-
lution proposing to increase the Student
Activities fee for undergraduate College
of Arts and Sciences students.

The resolution, which will be voted on
at tomorrow’s SGB meeting, requests
that the undergraduate CAS activities fee
be increased from $32 to $40 for full-
time students, hopefully to be effective
-by fall of 1994. The fee for part—time CAS
students will increase from $10 to $12.

Joe Cavalla, director of Student
Activities said the proposed increase in
the fee is a sign of the times.

“Due to inﬂation, costs of student pro-
grams have gone up and the cost of

doing business has gone up,” Cavalla
said. “We’ve tried to hold our limits on
[the feel, but to run programs, it costs
money and we haven’t'had a fee
increase in a number of years.”

According to Cavalla, the CAS Student.

Activities fee has remained the same
since 1987. The College of General
Studies last raised its fee in 1989 and the
most recent hike in the Graduate and
Professional Students Association’s fee
was 1990. '

Cavalla said any additional student
activity revenue will still be allocated
according to SGB’s allocations proce-
dures. _ 1 6

‘‘They’re not going to be giving money
out for the sake of giving it out,” he said.
“There are guidelines and procedures
used to fund organizations and they
stick tightly to them.”

If the SGB. votes yes on the proposal,

Cavalla said it will then be presented to
him. If he approves it, the proposal will
then go on to the vice-chancellor of stu-

dent affairs and the board of trustees for

final approval or dismissal.

SGB President Jacob Brody said the
proposed increase was necessary
because of a large increase in student
groups since the last fee increase. He
said the -proposal must be looked at as
how it will help the entire student body.

“Always when you start talking about
money there will be an outcry,” Brody
said. “In the scheme of things, 40 bucks
just adds up to two weekends of party-
ing or whatever. It’s all about putting it
into context.

“It’s just tough to fund student groups .

when you don’t have the money to do
just that,” he added.

According to SGB president pro tem-
pore Ted Schroeder, who submitted the

resolution at the board’s last meeting,
the number of student groups funded
through SGB’s allocations process has
increased from 76 in 1987 to 106 this
year. , .
Cavalla said students involved in
groups which are requesting more
money will understand the proposed fee
increase better than others. I

“No one likes an increase, but those
organizations close enough to the alloca-
tions process know they need the extra
money,” Cavalla said. “This is money
which goes right back to students. They
benefit from it.”

SGB Allocations chair
Cevallos said the easy availability for stu-
dents to start new organizations has pro-
duced more groups than the current fee
can cover.

“A lot of students have the opportunity

“The challenges are dif-
ferent and much of ‘what
he’ll do will depend on
his board,” Brody said.
Crowell said she’s
ready for her SGB term to
begin. .
“lCainpaigningl was
such a terrible experi-
ence,” Crowell said.“I’m
thrilled to have placed
third in the voting and
been named to the Senate
Council.” _
Crowell will be joined
by Elizabeth Mania and
Chris Fedeli on Senate
Council, which is made

up of the top three finish-

ers for board.

Crowell also said she _

was pleased with the fact
that three of the top five
vote-getters were women.
Deena Buchanan finished
fifth.

“This board is going to
be awesome,” Buchanan
said.“Thank you for vot-
ing for candidates who
really care.”

Buchanan, whose cam-
paign focused on the ade-
quate representation of
every student, said she

was especially pleased

that she was elected in
light of her unaffiliation
with a slate. 1

Of the eight board-elect
members, , only
Buchanan, Fedeli and
Todd Neufeld had run as
independents.

Mania, who was on a
different slate than
Pasquale but which was
also successful, said the
board-elect is “extremely
qL121lified.” 9

According to Mania, the
top finisher ainonglboard
candidates with 1285
votes, she is especially
glad to serve with
her slate mate Heath
Golden. In -their plat-
forms, they focused on
involvement and account-
ability. ’ 

“I’ni looking forward to
working on the projects
we talked about during
the campaign,” Mania
said.

“I’m glad the student ‘\
turnout was so high and 9

hope students continue to

give their input. I hope ‘
this SGB does a good job -

for them.”

Fedeli, who was also
named to the Senate
Council, said students
could not have picked a
better board.

“It will be a very pro-
ductive board,” he
said.“I’m looking forward
to working with Ross and
the entire SGB.”

Neufeld, who was also
named as a 1994 board
member, could not be
reached for comment.

tion officials.

Pitt ‘ta/ees   another, step

Byjohn B. Moore .\-
For The Pitt News

T wenty—three years ago the University of
Pittsburgh became one of the first universi-
ties in the world to host an annual seminar
devoted entirely to ‘jazz music. T. V

In 1974, Pitt became the first univ_ ity to
establish an International Jazz Hall of Fame.

And in 1993, Pitt has once agajnforged
new ground in the relationship between
academia and jazz with the publication of
the International jazzArcb-tucs journal. ’

According to university spokesperson
Marc Hopkins, “the journal provides a
forum for musicians and students to analyze
and debate the direction of jazz in the pop-
ular culture and academic research.”

He also said the journal bridges the gap
between jazz as a performance art and its

"study as an academic discipline.

One function of the journal is to publish
the manuscripts and transcriptions of the
lecturers that attend Pitt’s Jazz Seminar and
Conceit each year, Hopkinssaid.

The Pitt Jazz Seminar has brought such
musicians as Dizzie,Gillespie, Dexter
Gordon, Sonny Rollins and — Grover

-Theijournal will ccintain at least One Or
two of the talks given by musicians at the
Pitt Jazz Seminar- in every issue.

The journal not only serves as a publica-
tion for the miusician’s articles, but also
introduces the readers to poetry, editorials
and reviews on current books, records and
films related to jazz music,‘ ~

Of the journal’s contents, __Hopkins said it
includes a mix of intematioraal and domes-
tic perspectives on jazz, and the work of
various artists. .

Nathan Davis, a professor at Pitt and edi-
tor of the Internationaljazz Archives

_[ou.mal, said the journal has taken 24 years

to come into existence.

“At this point in time the only other acad-
emic journal that exists for jazz [in this
country] is at Rutgers University and they
haven’t published for the paste‘-‘three or four
years,” Davis said. _ .

He also said Austria publishes a journal
devoted to jazz, but it’s not strictly academ-
ic. '

Davis said what separates Pitt’s journal
from the others is the academic aspect of it.

“\X/liat makes it academic is a body of. inter-

The aiticles contained in the journals come
from professionals in various fields and
from various countries.

Peter Wehling, for example, is~an ortho-
pedic surgeon from Germany, while Francis
Hofstein is a practicing psychologist and
jazz musician in France.

Davis said the journal will probably be ‘

published annually for the first two or three
years and then twice a year after that.

The second journal will be coordinated
with the philosophy department and will
deal with the philosophy of jazz. .

Another aspect that separates Pitt’s jaz
journal from the others is that it will be dis-
tributed across the world. _ _

Davis said he plans to distribute copies of
the journal to the international committee,
representing 21 nations, that reviews the
papers submitted. .

“This journallis the second thing I’m most

to start new groups,”
Cevallos said. “We’re see-
ing a lot more groups
coming in and asking for
money and when you
only have so much
money, it makes it that
much harder to get start-
ed.”

Cevallos said students
should not worry that SGB
is trying to use the pro-
posed fee increase to
make money for its own
use.

“The reason for the

increase isn’t because SGB
is asking for more
money,” Cevallos said.
A “There just are more
organizations now. We
had to either squeeze
money from other organi-
zations or increase [the

available.”

GPSA Business Manager
David Sidore said he was
impartial about the pro-
posal, since GPSA is not
directly affiliated with
SGB.

“I really have no opin-

, ion’ one way or another,”
Sidore said. “We’re not
critical of SGB. They’re
another governance group
and we’re trying to get
along with them.”

According to Sidore,
GPSA’s current Student
Activities fee is $7 per
semester. Sidore said
GPSA was trying to raise
the fee last year, but was
not sure if an increase was
possible.

“SGB can offer a wider
range of services for stu-
dents because they have
more money to work
with,  Sidore said. 0

that, but it’s taking a

 stadeintuflees under control

The Student Government Board has recently initiated
a proposition to increase the student activity fee for
undergraduates in the -College of Arts and Sciences.
The increase will be from $32 to $40 for full-tirne stu-
dents and from $10 to $12 for part-tirne students.— The
SGB hopes to have the increase in place by the fall of
1994. .—

There are two reasons.given for the proposed fee
hike. The first is that the number of student groups
funded through the SGB has increased. The second
reason is that the cost of student programs has gone
up.

If the SGB passes the proposal, then it has to go
through three more levels of the administration before
final approval. First, the Director of Student Activities
will look at the proposal. Next, it will go. to the Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs. Then, it will go to the
Board of Trustees for final approval.

' All additional revenue is supposed to go to the vari-
ous groups through the same allocations process as

before the increase. According to David Sidore, busi-

ness manager of the Graduate and Professional
Student Association, the SGB will be able to “offer a
wider range of services because they have more
money to work with.” Yet, no one -has offered any

"specifics. It is difficult to see how more serviceswill

be offered» when the reasons for the increase suggest
that the current amount isn’t enough to fund the pro-
grams currently in place.

This activity fee increase should be defeated, if not
by the SGB, then by the administration. The‘ students
of this university have had to pay fee increases in all

other departments. Two years ago the computer fee,

doubled. There was an increase in the security fee last
year. Tuition has risen by approximately ‘six percent
over the past few years. What this amounts to is a
gradual soaking of the students through all of these
smaller fees. The cost of going to school is rising
faster than ever, and thesetfees begin to add up m a
student’s cost of living. '
Even though the last Student Activities Fee increase
was in 1989, the point is that the increase has occurred
all at once. The fees of all departments seem to be
making jumps-in an effort to keep pace with tuition
increases. In spite of the fact that the students are‘ the
ones who are supposed to benefit, it is the students
who are paying more out of their pockets to receive
less tangible results. _

The problem is not that just one fee has increased,

' but that all fees are gradually elevating costs beyond

reasonable bounds. Before any fee increase is voted
in, all of those concerned must examine. the reasons
behind the increase closely to ensure that the students
-will receive true benefits from the ‘larger amount of
money that they must pay. ' '

moment. Why are we here?
The “we” in this question is the
students of this university. It

. seems as though most people

are here intent on majoring in
a specialized area so that they
can earn a living.

However, the purpose
behind a university is more
than just job training. Which is
why everyone must meet that
list of requirements which
include a variety of courses

that are supposed to provide a.

“liberal arts” background. If
students are discriminating and
have foresight, then they can

‘ generally pick classes that are

in some way related to their
major and fulfill requirements
at the same time. All of this

increases a student’s level of’

specialization. _
The other option for students

is taking -a “gut” course.’

Everyone knows a few classes
in which all a student has to do
is stay awake to pass. The stu-
dents in these courses memo-
rize whatever is necessary for
the next test and promptly for-
get it afterwards.

There should be some
attempt by students to get a
true liberal education. “Gut”
courses and picking classes
with a narrow focus will not-
provide a true education.

- Dr. Alec Stewart, dean of the
University Honors College at
Pitt, gave a useful definition’ of
a liberal education. He said, “a
liberal education is one that

seeks to free individuals so that

they may bargain with circum-
stance.” Put more simply, it
teaches students to think about
and handle whatever comes
their way intelligently.

The idea is that students
should take a wide range of
courses that will expand their
ability to think, their percep-
tions of the world and their
appreciation of the things that
are part of it. ‘

The argument against this-

somewhat lofty goal is that it
isn’t getting any easier to find a
job, so people had better spe-
cialize in something if they
want to. find a job.
Unfortunately, this argument
doesn’t have the same merit as
it once did. The days of getting
a degree and working in one
field until retirement are gone.
According to the Detroit Free

Press .._M agazi n e," .Pres.id,ent- «

Clinton himself has predicted
that eighteen-year-olds today
can expect to change careers
up to eight times in their lives.

Benjamin
Jackson

The Economist has reported
that “young American men do
sixor more jobs during their
first 10 years after joining the
labor force.” They also noted
that the amount of formal com-
pany training an employee
receives depends on how long
the company expects their
employees to stay. However,
only ‘'10 percent of new
employees in the United States
received any formal training
from their employer.

The future lies in employers
and employees being ﬂexible.
Although there has been suc-
cess in companies that use lay-
offs as a last resort, businesses
are moving to a system where
professional employees must
demonstrate success in specific
projects. ‘I

Instead of a resume, white.

collar professionals are expect-

ed to have portfolios which

detail projects they have com-
pleted. Companies will evalu-
ate potential employees not
only by their portfolios, but
also by the compatability of the
employee with the company's
future projects. '

So, there are practical rea-
sons for getting a liberal arts

education. It is time for stu-
dents to make use of the

resources of schools and uni— ,

versities to sharpen their cur-
rent skills and learn new ones.
The key is not to specialize.
This way, people will have the
ability to bargain with the cir-
cumstances that come up in
the course of their career.
Everyone should see to the
basics -first._-The ability to use
clear, standard S English ' is highly
prized. Mathematics is the great
equalizer. It is easy for those
who know how to manipulate
numbers to manipulate people.
Finally, foreign languages are
also becoming increasingly
important. As more companies
are do business internationally,
they will be seeking employ-
ees who can work in two or
more languages competently.
Beyond the basics, students
should use the tremendous
resources around them to learn
aboutwhat interests them.
There is no point in merely
sliding by and paying attention

only in the classes that are

needed for a major. Pursuing
another interest may be the
deciding factor in whether or
not an employer hires a stu-
dent.

Instead of specialization, it is
time for liberalization of educa-
tion. This will equip studentsto
deal with circumstances,

’ regardless of how they may

change.

So as the students of this uni—
versity move into the next
term, they should seize the
opportunity to broaden their
abilities and sharpen their
skills. They should do this, not
so much to be a more ‘valuable
asset to an employer, but- to be
of greater value to themselves.
There is no value in just
becoming a mere cog in the
machine, but there is value in
becoming an liberally educated
person. '

Volleyball eyes sixth straight title

The Panthers head
to Philadelphia in
search of yet
another Big East

Conference crown
By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Wri‘ter_

a Six days ago against Louisville, the Pitt

~, volleyball team (20-9) did something it

had not done this season —- pulled out a

tight match against a quality opponent. It _

was a solid win that stretched‘ the Panther
winning streak to nine matches.

Four days ago, that same Pitt team was

’ nowhere to be" found as Notre Dame

, demolished the Panthers in three games.

Pitt assistantcoach Brian Begor said
that the team’s focus goes beyond recent
history, as they enter this weekend’s Big
East Tournament at Jake Nevin Field

, House on the Villanova University carn-

pus. .
“There is a certain amount of tradition

- that [Pitt] teams in the past have held up,”

Begor said. A . .

That tradition is one "of dominance
within the conference. The Panthers have
won five straight confererice titles. lWith

' that tradition comes expectations and the
challenge to do it again.
1 “We felt [a challenge] last year,” Pitt
Head Coach Cindy Braziel said. “This year
they are feeling that because weédidg have
a rough go. You always know in the tour-
nament you have something to prove.”

Pitt proved it was still the best in the

‘ regular season, pounding out a perfect 7-

0 record against Big East competition.
Only Providence took the Panthers as far
as five games, and that was at the end of
a long road trip in which the team was
adjusting to losing outside hitter Carrie
Thornton to an ankle injurytwo days ear-
lier. '

“We respect the opponents we are
going to play even though we’ve\beaten
them all,” Begor said. ‘ _ . ,

The team getting the most respect has
been Seton Hall. With the exception of a

The Pitt volleyball team is favored to capture the 1993 Big East championship.

3-1 loss to Pitt Oct. 1, the Pirates did not
lose an official conference match all year.

At the time, Braziel said she expected
the Pirates to be the top challengers.

,“Seton Hall is averyabig “team,” Braziel
said. “A lot of them can hit. That’s the
kind of team that is going to give us a lot
of trouble.” . _ '

Last weekend, Seton Hall lost what was
officially a non—conference match against

the hottest team in the conference, the
fourth-seeded Villanova Wildcats (25-7, 4-
5 in the Big East), who have won 15
matches in a row. -

That streak followed a close loss to
Connecticut Oct. 10 and a dismantling by

the Panthers two days earlierf

Pitt will open up Saturday at 11:30 a.m.

Dan Lauso ‘
Staff Writer

The long and winding road is
"finally about to come to an end

; for the 1993 Pitt Panther football
team as they line up against the .

Temple University Owls

Saturday afternoon at Veteran’s'

Stadium.

According to Panthers Head,

Coach Johnny Majors, the
-Panthers must play better on
both sides of the line of scrim-
mage than they did’ in their 33-0
loss to Boston College last
Saturday. l .
“On offense we got whipped
up front  we got pushed back

on defense. It was a poor per-

forrnance and a poor effort. We
have to, improve in_a short
amount-_of time if we want to

__winthis Saturday,” Majorssaid.

,It’s been -a" tough season for
the ~Pant,l_ier,s,  probably

been an even tougher season
for. Head Coach Ron Dickerson
and his 1-9 Temple team.

The Owls have been blown

out inall of their losses. Aside _

from staying out of the Big East

_ basement, a victory for either’
team could leave a good taste in

the mouths of both head coach-
es leading into the recruiting
season. 1 1

‘‘It’s whose ever’s game for

the taking,” said Majors. “A win

in the last game lasts all off-sea-
son.’’ 1

Many Panther fans look at the
Temple team and are expecting
an easy victory. But the
Panthers are looking at their
season finale as a tough battle
ahead. A .

“The Owls ‘run a pro-set
offense. From what I’ve seen "it’s
simple, but it’s effective,”
Panthers’ senior free safety

~ Doug Whaley said. 9

If Lombardi Award semifinal-
ist Tre Johnson is able to play,
look for Temple to run the ball

behind him. Johnson, the Owls’ _

6-foot—3-inch, 300-pound start-

ing left tackle, has missed the
last two weeks due to a nagging

ankle injury. .

The Owls will be without the
services of starting quarterback
Phil Lang because of an ankle
sprain that he re-aggravated
against West Virginia.

Defending against the Owls’
offense may be more difficult if
starting ‘inside linebacker Tom
Tumulty is unable to go on
Saturday. Tumulty, theiheart
and soul of Pitt’s multiple '4-3
defense, is listed as question-
able due to a swollen forehead
sustained against Boston
College last week. '

When the.Panthers are on
offense, look for them to do
what they’ve ‘done all season

long — run Curtis Martin, over
and over again. ‘

The Panthers’ effective run-
ning attack should be able to
exploit the young Owls’ stock
defense. ,

With receivers Dietrich Jells
out and Junior Green’ doubtful,
look for quarterback John Ryan
to throw short, controlled pass-
es, especially to Martin out of
the backfield. ,

_ Although this ‘game isn’t‘ the
biggest game of the college sea-
son —— like Florida State
University vs. Notre Dame —
the key to victory in this game is
the same as it was at South
Bend last week. The team that

A makes the fewest mistakes will

be the victorious team.

“We can’t afford to make mis-l

takes, fundamental or mental,”
Temple Head Coach Ron
Dickerson said.

Although the teams have only

strange 1993 football season at Temple

three victories between them,
both teams are expecting a
tough fight in the season finale.
“They’re a good football team
with a good defense that has
gotten better,” Dickerson said.
“They’ve held up well through-
out the year.” -
“There are peaks and valleys
in every aspect of life. Last
Saturday was definitely a valley

A for us, but I fully expect us to

play better [this] Saturday,”
Majors said.

Although both programs have
been down the past couple of
seasons, both coaches see
bright futures ahead for their
respective program.

“This first year has been great.
I still have a smile on my_face.
We’re headed in the right direc-
tion,” Dickerson said. A

“With a victory on Saturday, it
can drastically improve our
recruiting efforts,” Majors said.

CODEINE '

It must be really rough to be a
sensitive mal'e living in New
York City. The outside world is
so corrosive and harsh that a
guy’s only recourse is to steal all
of his grandmothers pain med—
ication, buy a guitar, sit inside
and start a band. That band is
Codeine, who will pull into the
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern

leave you feeling like Leonard

The downtown New York
music scene has spawned
droves of performers whose
music defies pigeonholing. It’s
gotten to a point where some-

whether they play jazz, rock,
noise or all of the above.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 18, 1993

 

The ticket sales for the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Co. are going
exceedingly well for their per-
formance at the Fulton Theatre
this Saturday. Bill T. Jones is
considereda great choreogra-
pher these days, and will show-
case five of his own dance cre-
ations, with a cerebral mix of
political innuendo, art, athleti-
cism and original movement
sequences.

Fomied in 1982, the company
has perfomied in 50 states and
22 countries. Jones has created
over 30 dances for the company

_ and created other works com-

missioned by ballet and modem
dance companies worldwide.
You may recall seeing Jones in
a performance as part of the
“Alive From Off Center” televi-
sion series that aired nationally
on PBS in the summer of 1989.

The diverse company of 11
members are known for their
creative partnering, energy and
technical prowess. The dancers’
eclectic training background of
acting, classical ballet, and ath-
letics contributes to Jones’
choreography.

Co-founder Arnie Zane, a bril-
liant talent in his own right, died
in 1988 from AIDS. Jones, an
HIV positive black male, lost

  

Seam
The Problem With Me
Touch and Go Records

Seam is a partnership of slow
rock and Sooyoung Park’s cre-
ativity. The band originated as a
side project of his former band,
Bitch Magnet. He recruited Mac
McPherson (drums),
vocalist/guitarist of Superchunk
and owner of Merge Records,
and Lexi_Mitchell (bassist) of the
now-defunct Lilies (not the
Slumberland .Records band).

The band released “Days of
Thunder,” its debut 7” single, on
Homestead Records. “Granny
9x,” its next single, preceded its
first full-length - effort,-
Headspar/es. The band began to
make headway in the indie rock
scene conjuring up comparisons
to Slint and Codeine. Slow-core
darlings Codeine even recorded
Seam’s “New Year’s” on its last
album, Frigia’ Star.

v After Mac’s migrationback to
Superchunk, Seam alternated
through another lineup for its

great loves close to him to
AIDS. He creates works today
stemming from topics such as
AIDS, loss, racism and social
unrest.

“Bill T.Jones  takes every
dance he makes, every action
he_performs to the edge of
excess, sometimes hanging over
that fine line by his thumbs,”
wrote Deborah Jowitt of the
Village Voice, “Yet I find the
richness, the sheer hedonism of
his work tremendously moving
— as if, life being the perilous
thing it is in the age of AIDS, he
wants every dance to be a ban-
quet. For himself, for his
dancers, and for us”.

Touch and Go. Satisfaction still
not within Sooyoung’s reach,
Seam placed an ad in the Ajax
Records classifieds for band
members. The ad resulted in the
addition of two new members:
ex-Poster Children’s Rob Rising
(drums) and ex-Repulse Kava’s
Craig White (guitar).

Brad Wood of Shrimp Boat
produced the album, and his
latest project was Liz Phair’s
Exile in Gztyuille, which topped
the college alternative ranks.

“Rafeal,” the opening track, is
the recipe for Seanfs conven-
tionalized sound, melodic with
fuzzy eruptions. A person’s mis-
understood feelings _and the
combination of loneliness is the
theme‘ of the song, which
reﬂects the emotions of many of
them.

“Bunch” is a combination of
ﬂashy-distorted guitar with the
waves of Sooyoung’s vocals
battling the noise of the band’s
weapons. “Road to Madrid,”_
“Stage 2000” and “Dust and
Turpentine” are murmurs of
songs which can nestle you into
a sort of REM ‘dream mode.
Each song breaks into its own
distinct homage to the roar of
the distorted guitar.

I These are the Seam songs that
you will be recording for your
friends.

“Sweet Pea” was originally
released. on the Kernal EP but
reappears on this album. It’s a
great song.

“Somethings Burning” is a
poppy tune. Well, for Seam it is.
Sooyoung still keeps in connec-
tion with his barely-conscious
vocals.

In the song “The Wild Cat,”

his vocals disappear, never
becoming any clearer than a
forgotten dream until the end
when he sings, ”I’ve got nothing
for you/I’ve got nothing to hide

from you/I’ve got nothing to

lose” These are the aiming-loud
lyrics.

“Autopilot,” the finale, is
slow. No drums, no pace.
Almost a monotonous beat, no
exciting guitar solo. It’s a great
finale.

The local scene for melodic
rock has taken off with Hurl
signing to DeSoto Records. Is
this the new sound for indie
rock? Well, who cares! You only
get about a half—hour of enjoy-
ment from the songs, but the
album is worth the mind «trip
without the nasty side effects.

  Safely

Continued from page S-1
Keep the Dog and as half of
the duo OWT.

No Safety eventually
branched out into a quintet
in 1988, rounded out by Ann
Rupel on bass and vocals,
Doug Seidel on guitar and
Tim Spelios on drums. Their
first release with the full line-
up came with two tracks on
A&M’s Live at the Knitting
Factory Volume 3 in 1990.
The songs showcase a band
that never stays in one place.
Parkins’ sedate accordion

. starts off “Discuss It,” before
Rupel kicks in with a funk
backbeat. “Oh No” approxi-
mates hardcore, although the
screaming vocal trade—offs
belie thrash. 1

The sound continued with
1992’s Spill, but since then, »
the band went through some
musical changes without
really knowing exactly what
these changes were.

“Early on,” Cochrane said,
“No. Safety was a much more
heady band. It was too much
about the complexity of
thought, not so much about
the interaction of people and
our surroundings.”

Somehow the band began
interacting with the audience
when its nonnally off-kilter
music inspired audiences to,
of all things, start mosh pits.
Rupel attributes this change,
in part, to a shift in song
structure which adds “some
formal element to give peo-
ple something to latch onto.
That makes it easier for them
to accept distortion and
noise and atonality and
stuff.”

But don’t think No Safety
sticks to 1-4-5 chord changes
and straight rhythms. “We
may be a rock band now,”
Seidel said, “but we’re not
connecting with the audi-
ence the same way a -normal
rock band does. With us, it’s
like you’re driving off the
road and your car’s falling
apart. We’re making the V
audience feel that too.”

Their name still holds true.

  Brett
Fondrk

As I sat in class yesterday,.I
couldn’t help but overhear a
conversation about Pitt bas-
ketball’s 18-point loss to
Marathon Oil Tuesday night.
The words “pathetic” and
“horrible” surfaced a few
times.

A True, the Panthers would
have liked to open the exhibi-
tion season with a win, but
head coach Paul Evans
pushed the right buttons, giv-
ing Pitt’s young players two
valuable commodities: confi-
dence and experience.

Evans stayed with guards
Jason Maile and Sotiris
Aggelou and forward Willie
Cauley even though all three
had poor shooting nights.

“Our main concern in a
game like this one is with giv-

‘ ing kids minutes; see what
they can do. I thought there
were some jitters out there,”
Evans said.

Yes, there were some jitters,
but with more playing time

comer Willie Cauley would
get the nod for power'for- _
ward. Anyone who has seen a
basketball practice knows that
Gant is ready to play this year.
Constant hustle. It paid off
from the start Tuesday.
Besides chipping in eight
points, Gant was a terror on
the boards as he hauled down
13. He also looked as if he
spent the summer lifting.
Besides being more
defined, he has added a men-
acing tattoo on his shoulder.

Can Gant do a Dennis
Rodman imitation during the
season? Tattoo and 20—plus

ful, but regardless, he looked
good Tuesday night.

0. Eric Mobley.

Twenty-six points, 17
rebounds and two three—point
plays —- a big night from the
big man. Mobley looked in
great shape. To go along with
his rim-rattling dunks, he
showed off a number of

_ moves in the low post..Sho1t

jumper, baby hook — moves
that NBA scouts love to see
and opponents have night-
mares about. It’s clear that he
has worked hard to improve
his game in the off-season.

By the way, his first dunk
came at the 8:07 mark of the
first half. A two-hander over
two stunned defenders. Foul.
Free—throw is good. Mobley
could have a monster year.

Dickerson optimistic
about Temple's future

So far this season, the Temple
University Owls are currently in
last place in the Big East
Football Conference.

Their record is a horrible 1-9
overall, the lone win against
Eastern Michigan, 51-28, in the
season opener.

Despite this gloom and doom,
the Temple community feels
that they have a diamond in the
rough in the Owls’ football pro-
gram.

They feel that, in a couple of
years‘,'"'they will be battling
Miami and West Virginia for the
Big East conference champi-
onship.

After hearing this you ‘might
ask, are they crazy? Is this a
joke?

Not to Temple fans. And cer-
tainly not to their first-year head
coach. 9

On Nov. 24, 1992, Temple
made history by naming former
Clemson assistant Ron
Dickerson as their 22nd head

football coach. The Western
Pennsylvania native became the
first African-american to
become a major college football
coach.

“I think that it is a long time
overdue,” Dickerson said.

“For me to be the first big-
time black coach in 1993 is sad
for college football. There
should have been black coach-
es years ago.”

Dickerson, who waited a long
time for this opportunity, feels
optimistic that he is capable of
changing the youthful program
around.

“I believe this team is a sleep-
ing giant,” Dickerson said.
“Right now, we are not physi-
cally able to stand up to other
teams, but I see progress every
week.

“I don’t want anyone out
there to miss out on what we
have to offer. The school is
within a fine community; that

-West

By Stephen Flinn
Staﬂ Writer

As Pitt plays at Temple this
Saturday for the Battle of the
Big East Basement, justthe
opposite will be occurring with
the Battle of the Big East Titans
going on at Morgantown, West
Virginia, when the 9-0
Mountaineers clash with the 8-1
Miami Hurricanes.

The big game of the regular
college football season may
have already been played this
year when former No. 1 Florida
State lost at (then No. 2, current-
ly No. 1) Notre (Dame last
Saturday. _ -

But this Saturday’s conference
match-up of No. 4 Miami and
No. 9 West Virginia is not far
behind in being another
humdinger when it comes to
this year’s ultimate college foot-

ball match-ups.

West Virginia is one of only
four unbeaten Division I foot-
ball teams coming into this
weekend, the other three being
the Fighting Irish, Auburn, and
Nebraska. Miami is coming into

the game with only one loss,

which came at the hands of FSU
on Oct. 9. The USA
Today/Coaches Poll ranks the
Mountaineers sixth and the
Hurricanes fourth. ’

Both teams will be playing for
all the Big East marbles in the
conference’s first year of official
round-robinplay — with the
winner guaranteed a New
Year’s Day Bowl bid and possi-
bly a chance at the National
Championship itself. V

“Whoever wins this game will
have a chance to compete for it
all,”_ Miami coach Dennis
Erickson said.

This is West Virginia’s best

ular season, but lost to Notre

Nine points and seven
boards. Not that impressive, but
Orlando did do something that
impressed me Tuesday. Pitt was
down 93-73 with under four
minutes left and a few players
had their heads down. Antigua
took the ﬂoor and barked
words of encouragement to his
defeated teammates. The
younger players need this kind
of encouragement.

Now on to the young guys.

0 Willie Cauley. Eight points

- and seven rebounds. There are

a lot of people out there expect-

ing this guy to be Larry Johnson._

Remember, he is a junior col-
lege transfer and despite the
fact that he has the physique of

7 a god, he'is human. Cauley was

nervous, that’s all. He has the
tools necessary to dominate the
paint. He looks good in prac-
tice. Cauley will come around
and have a big year.

0 Jason Maile. Two for nine
from three-point land, “six A
points. He missed most ‘of last
season because of mono. If
given the chance, he can stick
the three. _

0 Sotiris Aggelou. A surprise
staiter, Aggelou was the only
guy, besides Mobley, to hit dou-
ble digits against the Oil, throw-
ing in 10 points. He had two
threes, but had 5 shots blocked.

He’s not used to the crowd
and seemed to be the most ner-
vous out of the bunch. This guy
is a deadly shooter who has
been great in practice. With
experience, the 3's will come.

_- Jaime Peterson. Didn’t score

and played only 12 minutes.
Give him time, he can provide
some quality minutes. '

0 Shaun Koontz. Two points.
A walk-on who probably didn’t
expect to play. He got the
biggest applause of the night
when he entered the game with
2:32 minutes left. He’s not afraid
to shoot and is on his way to
becoming a crowd favorite.

On top of all that this, the
game meant nothing. Who
cares? The win wasn’t impor-
tant. What was important is that
Evans gave the young guys
some time, a move that will pay
off later in the season when he
needs their contributions.

same community I hope will
continue to support [us] in
years to come.

This team has hung in there
and everyone has given every
bit of effort,” said Dickerson.

Speaking of effort,
Dickerson’s work is not just
limited to the football field.
He is a role model to the chil-
dren of the North
Philadelphia community.

On the first day of practice,’
Dickerson walked over to the
fence surrounding the prac-
tice ﬁeld and talked to anyone ~
who yvanted to hear — the

J kids, their mothers, just guys
passing bywho had stopped
to watch. .

Dickerson feels it’s his des-
tiny to stay close to the chil-
dren of Philadelphia, where

the poverty level is high and
the college graduation rate is
low. .

“The young kids in this area
have a lot of athletic ability,”
Dickerson said. “The young-
sterlsl admire us and they
aspire to be athletes. I tell
them it is important to get
good grades.

“If they want to be athletes,
they have to get an education
first. Because without an edu-
cation, they will not be able to
achieve anything.

"My goal is for thekids that
I talk to [to] be very successful
in life.”

Dickerson is also very vocal
about stereotypes of the stu-
. dent-athlete.

“Some people feel that the
student-athlete is treated as a
kid with [a] silver spoon in

their mouths [sicl,” he said.
“But they put hours and hours
of time in; they are sometimes
mistreated and not under-
stood.

“There are a lot of strong
critics and I’m very critical of
critics; they don’t know any-
thing about being a student-
athlete, but they always have-
something to say.”

While his off—the-field antics
are making a difference in the
lives of thousands of kids, he
knows that in order to propel
the Owls to a higher level
there is one major goal — get-
ting the local talent to stay
home.

He even has. a motto for
doing this: “If you come to
Temple you will make histo-
ry. If you go elsewhere you
will be as part of tradition.”
