one-act farce, “Art For Art's
Sake,” written and directed
by Sunny Weslager, Ed. ’32,
next Tuesday evening in the
Falk School Playhouse.

The performance is the ﬁrst
one-act farce ever written by
an undergraduate and produced
on the campus by a campus
organization. The play is a
satire on modern art, and it is
written in the same humorous
style that characterizes the au-
thor’s column in this paper.

The performers who will
play in “Art For Art's Sake”
are the following: Leo Mer-
vitz, Col. ’35, Hugo Wynn,
Col, '32, Tillie Moyers, Ed. ’33,
Eleanor Stuve, Ed. ’32, and

The play will be given at
8:15 o’clock next Tuesday with
three other one-act plays.

Debate Trip
Men Chosen

Butterbach and Bracken
Go South March 23

William Butterbach, Col. ’33,
and John P. Bracken, Col. '34, have
been selected by Professor W. M.
Parrish to make the southern tour
of the Men’s Debating Association.
Butterbach and Bracken will be ac-
companied by Mr. Richard Murphy,
assistant coach of debating. The
debaters were selected after try-
outs held recently by the Associa-
tion, and they will argue the af-
firmative viewpoint of the “Cen-
tralized Control” question in all de-
bates on the tour which begins
March 23.

Butterbach commutes to Pitt
from Crider’s Corners. «He entered
the University from South Hills
High school, where he was promi-
nent in school activities. He is ma-
joring in political science, and is
particularly interested in the ameli-
oration of social disorders. Last
year Butterbach took part in sever-
al extension debates of the Men’s
Debating Association, but his inter-
collegiate experience is limited to
debates with North Carolina and
Allegheny, both of which took place
this year,

Bracken entered Pitt from Dor-
mont High school, where he was
a member of the National Honor
Society, and graduated in the high-
est sixth of his class. He also is
majoring in political science. He
is assistant manager of debating,
and has had considerable experi-
ence in both extension and inter-
collegiate debates. In 1931 Bracken
ran for Recorder of Deeds on the
Democratic ticket in Allegheny
County and polled 17,000 votes. He
is general chairman of the Pitt po-
litical convention and has been in-
strumental in bringing nationally
prominent political leaders to the,
campus for that event.

These twodebaters upheld cen-
tralized control in a debate before
the Advertising Club of Pitsburgh
against the team of McBride Flem-
ing Jones and Edwin Sidney Lan-.
ier, of the University of North
Carolina last Tuesday. Lanier, a de-
scendant of the poet, Stoney Lanier,
gave a really entertaining speech,
although the debaters failed to
clash as well they might have, as
North Carolina believed Pitt would
advocate the Swope plan.

On Tuesday, March 22, before
the team leaves for the south, a
tuneup debate will take place with
Samue1 Strauss, Col. ’32, and Cyril
Jacobs, Bus. Ad. ’32, who argued
the negative angle on the western
trip. forming the opposition. This
debate will take place at 1 o'clock
in room 217 Alumni Hall.

ing. The first of these will be held

bate will be held on April 18 at
Brownsville High school where
Margaret Webb is faculty advisor.

The upperclassmen who are
coaching the freshman group are
Hannoth Taimuty, Ed. ’32, Gladys
Pyle, "01. ’33, Zora Unkovitch_ Col.
’33, and Mary McKinniss, Ed. '34.

sent out on these debates includes
Alice Reinherr,‘ Col.’ Eva Sypniew-
ski, Col., Ruth -Simon, Ed., Irma
T3-X1191‘. Col., and Lillian Myers,
Ed.

Trinity College tonight at 8 o’clock.
After a debate with George Wash-
ington tomorrow and a sight see-
ing trip around the city Sunday

they have a heavy schedule of ‘de-
bates next week.

The girls who are on the trip

Kahn, women's debating coach;
Dr. Auleene Marley Jamison, med-
ical adviser to women; Dr. Florence
Teagarden, associate professor of
psychology; Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter,
instructor in modern languages;
Miss Elizabeth Miller, graduate as-
sistant to the dean of women.

Senior women who have been se-
cured to work in conjunction with
the faculty are: Edith Raschen,
president of W. S. G. A., Jean Davis
president of Mortar‘ Board; Claire
Cryder, president of W. A. A.,
Aleeth Roberts, president of Y. W.
C. A., Elizabeth Bartley, president
of Glee Club; \Louise Linn, chief
justice of Senior Court; Mildred
Levenson, president of Panhellenic,
Elaine Foraker, associate editor of
the Pitt Weekly, and Edith Hirsch
editor of the Owl.

Permission has been granted by
the deans of the various schools for
excused absences from classes for
those who attend the training con-
ference.

Members of the Activities Com-
mittee of W. S. G. A. who are
sponsoring the project in con-
junction with the W. S. G. A. ex-
ecutive committee are: Evelyn

churia where he has made a first-
hand study of the Sino-Japanese
conflict.

Dr. Eddy’s latest book, “The
Challenge of the East,” is‘.'lust off
the press and has been favorably
received by critics on such descrim-
inating journals as the New York
Times and Forum Magazine. ‘His
"Challenge of the East” is a sup-
plement to his widely-read “Chal-
lenge of Russia.”

Dr. Eddy will be remembered on
the campus from an assembly ad-
dress in Ma.rch of last year. At his
address last year Dr. Eddy scored
the youth of America for not having
a definite plan and was vehement
in his attitude against the lack of
seriousness on the part of college
students. A similar outlook is being
expected at his coming assembly.

Other university groups are ar-
ranging with W. W. Mendenhall, Y
secretary, to have Dr. Eddy address

IJWL PIBKS HELEN AND
ADIINIS [IF FIIAT BBIIUPS

One set of girls at Pitt is
going to thank Fred Jockum,
photographer for the 1932 Owl,
for kind words- And Fred has

’ rather adroitly placed himself
in line for the traditional box
of cigars from a group of Pitt
youths who make up a frater-
nity. _

Fred, who most of the time
surrounds himself with reti-
cence to the Nth degree, com-
mitted himself long enough
this week to name the sorority
with the most beautiful girls
and the fraternity with what
he considered the most hand-
some men. But Fred prefaced
his remarks in rare diplomatic
style, by maintaining that he
found fraternity men and wo-
men at Pitt as nice, if not bet-
ter, than at many other schools
which he visits. And Fred
gets around a lot with that cam-
era of his during the course of
a school term. I

But to allay the curiosity
that must be mounting by now
——Fred picked Kappa Kappa
Gamma as the sorority with
the magazine cover women,
and gave the collar-ad title to
Delta Tau Delta, although he
admitted that Kappa Sigma
came in a. close second.

The young men and women
in the Owl Hall of Fame, whom
Fred recently photographed in
formal attire, portray the ideal
type .of college student’ in the
opinion of the man who pho-
graphs hundreds of the college
species each year.

Pitt Graduate Chosen ,

lege with highest honor, achieved
his M. A. degree at Pitt in 1930.
and went to the Scheffield school
on a. Coffin fellowship. He is carry-
ing on physical and mathema.tical

YM-YW Plan
Trip Tuesday

Relations Club To Study
Local Negro Culture

 

“The Negro Culture of Pitts-
burgh” will be the subject of inves-
tigation for the second Human Re-
lation trip .of the Y. M. and Y. W.
C. A. planned for Tuesday, March
22, when at 2:30 o'clock the group
will leave Heinz House. o

The Urban League will be the
first place inspected by the party.
The director, R. Maurice Moss, will
explain the work of the group in a
short talk and will act as a guide
during the remainder of the trip.

At the Ebenezer Baptist Church,
the pastor, Rev. T. J. King, will
discuss the religious life of the
negro. The next stop will be made
at the office of the “Courier,” the
outstanding negro newspaper of
the United States.

After inspecting the plant, the
group will eat a cafeteria dinner
and be introduced to Henry
Craft, executive secretary of the
Center Avenue branch of the Y. M.
C. A., and Miss Isabel Lauson, sec-
retary of the Center avenue branch
of the Y. W. C. A.

Two speeches have been planned
for the after-dinner session. The
first will be given by Attorney A.
L. Vann, editor of the “Courier,”
on “The Negro in Business.” Miss
Thrysa W. Amos, Dean of Women,
will closethe trip with a discussion
on appreciating “The Cinnamon
Tree," the book written by Jessie
Fauset. ‘

Judging from the comments on
the first human relation trip study-
ing the unemployment situation and
welfare work of Pittsburgh, the
second trip promises to be both
interesting and educative.

“Some By-Products of Radio,” an
interesting electrical demonstration
is being presented before various
Pittsburgh high schools by three of
the senior students in the Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering.
They have chosen this subject as
the basis of their thesis investiga-
tion. The group, consisting of J.
V. 'Heesch, W. F. Dombart and
Warren Wickerham, all E. E. '32,
presented the program at Mononga-
hela High school today.

Using a photo-electric cell, bet-
ter known as the “Electric Eye,"
as the heart of a control set, they
are able to fire a gun, set off flash
powder, and ring a bell by merely
lighting a match at a great dis-

the complete schedule from the
preliminary two weeks session in
June, to the post two weeks session
in August, has been announced in
bulletins released by the summer
session office.

The regular sixweeks campus
session will begin June 28 and con-
tinue until August 5. The eight
weeks science courses in botany,
chemistry, physics, mathematics,
and zoology will begin at the same
time and continue until August 19.
Registration for these courses will
be held in Syria Mosque Saturday
June 25 and Monday, June 27. The
ten weeks course for engineers will
begin on June 13 and continue to
August 19. The downtown evening
session, which has proved particu-
larly attractive to those employed
during the day, will begin on June
13 and continue for six Weeks until
July 22. The intensive two weeks
sessions precede and follow the
regular session. The early two
weeks session begins shortly after
Commencement, on June 13 and
continues until June 24. The post
two weeks session immediately fol-
lows the close of the regular ses-
S1011. beginning on August 8 and
ending August 19.

Pitt Centers Give Courses .

Branch classes will be offered
at the University centers at Johns-
town, Erie and Uniontown. The
Johnstown session for six or nine
weeks of work begins June 6, and
continues until August 5. The Erie
session, June 27-August 5, offers
courses in several departments for
six weeks. The six weeks Union-
town session will begin on June 8
and end July 19. At Presque Isle,
Erie, the University will continue
to conduct its lake laboratory, off-
ering opportunities for research in
Botany an_d.Zoology. Courses offer-
ed here are a part of the regular
six weeks session, and supplement
those at the Erie center. The Na-
ture Study Camp at Na-Wak-Wa
Lodge, in the Allegheny Mountains
will also be continued, and courses
will be offered in field natural his-
tory.

The University of Pittsburgh
summer session has for the last
two years been the ninth largest
summer session in_ the United
States. In 1930 more than 3,500 in-
dividuals took courses in the vari-
ous sessions offered by the Uni-
versity. Last year this number in-
creased more than 500, bringing
the total summer session enroll-
ment to 4,007 students.

has too much to do aside from rendering the decisions was
plainly proven in the Pitt-Carnegie matches last week.

In the 135-pound bout, Hellegers of Tech came dancing out
of his corner with a smile on his face and with his guard down
and Santicola, rushing out of the Pitt corner, landed a right
‘on his chin and followed with a left to the same location.
Several Pitt rooters let out a yell right there and only then did
Simon Carlson, the referee, realize that Santicola had landed
a blow. His back was turned to the fighters at the time but
the noise quickly brought his attention back to the bout.

If the bout had been close, the blows which Santicola
landed at the start of the fight might have m.ade a difference
in the decision; but as it was, the unevenness of the battle
diverted the attention of the fans from the opening incidents.

Having capable judges at the ringside would prevent any

miscarriage of justice such as

Spikers Plan
To Move To
Stadium Soon

Weather Holds Squad
Indoors; Freshmen
Seem Strong

 

The weather foiled Coach Frank
Shea’.-3 plans of taking his track
team outdoors last week, and the
spikers continued to practice in the
track house. However, as soon as
the weather permits, the team will
move down to the Stadium where
they will have plenty of room.

The first ‘varsity meet or’ the
season, with Ohio State here, April
23, is beginning to draw near and,
as the Buckeyes always have a
powerful squad Shea hopes to‘ be
able to, have hisboys in perfect
condition by that time. The team
needs plenty of practice yet, before
it can begin to be ranked as pow-
erful, but at least it has shown pos-
sibilities thus far.

Frosh, Have Sprinters

The freshman squad is beginning
to take shape now and it appears
to be well balanced and fairly
strong. It will have good men in
every event, men who will be cap-
able of taking a satisfactory num-
ber of points.

parts, for the Pittsburgh boxing judges seem to have taken a

_llking to the burly cornhusker.

Two weeks ago, against Cadet

Olsen",-of the Army, “Cowboy" was hit with everything but the

stool, but was awarded a handy decision.

Last Saturday, Jerry

O'Toole, Carnegie's star fullback, apparently outpointed him
, and there seemed to be little doubt of the outcome; but Siegel

was again awarded the decision.

Sieel’s face was a bloody

smear throughout the ﬁnal round, but Referee Carlson made no

move to stop the bout.

The Cowboy made frequent wild

lunges in Jerry's general direction, but they rarely found their

mark, and “rancis more often

close range.

This bout incidently decided the meet in favor of the Uni-
. versity of Pittsburgh, 4-3, and seemed to substantiate the
statement that the “Pitt boxing team can lose everywhere but

in Pittsburgh.”

-Bill Parriott, West Virginia football player who conducts a sports
column in the school paper, says this:
_ West Virginia lost to Pitt, Temple and Penn State, but the
best treat of the whole season came when the Panthers stepped
into the ring in the Field house and got plastered all over the

canvas in their return match

Volley Ball Tournament
. Will Probably be Held

Due to a general demand by stu-
dents and faculty for a volley ball
tournament, the department of
physical education has decided to
sponsor such an event, if there is
a, sufficient number of teams inter-
ested to hand in the names of the
players and the captain, and his
address and telephone number.

Teams will be composed of six
men, but each team will be privileg-
ed to enter eight men. All teams
will be composed of students or
faculty members or both. Fraterni-

Each member of the club will play
two games in the tourney.

Milton Paul, Col. '32, a member
of the Pitt team, is entered in the
Western Pennsylvania Chess
Tournament which is being held at
the Pittsburgh Chess Club. He has
won three and lost three games in
the tourney, to date.

Yale University has challenged
the Pitt team to a match in New
York City. Thomas Carroll, (ET

nounces that the. match :wii1.prob-

 be refused.

The frosh sprinters look very
good. Charlie Menaker of Jefferson
High, New York, is one of the best.
He has done the 100 in 9.9 seconds
and the 70 yard dash in near world

Riﬂe Team
Departs For
‘Title Meet

Cincinnati Scene of
Annual Collegiate
Tournament

 

Pitt’s rifle team, with a good
record in meets of this season be-
hind them, left early yesterday
morning for the National Intercol-
legiate Shoulder to Shoulder Rifle
meet to be held at Cincinnati to-
morrow morning.

Practically every college of any
importance in the country is send-
ing a team to the championships.
The winner will undoubtedly have
the inside rail to claim the Collegi-
ate Championship of the United
States.

Six men are being sent by the
University to represent Pitt at
Cincinnati: Captain Backen, Wuer-
tenberger, Wilson, Mair, Taussig,
and Zoller. All six of these men
have had plenty of experience dur-
ing the past season and should
make an excellent showing. Lt.
Wilson, coach of the team, is op-
timistic about the team’s chances.

The rifle team has compiled an
enviable ‘record this year, losing
but two matches. Oneof these end-
ed in a tie, but the difference in
scores in one of the shooting po-
sitions gave the match to their
opponents. The other loss was by
a one point margin. If the riflers
can come through and place among
the first three or four, their repu-
tatlon will be materially enhanced.

The same firing positions used
in regular competition will be em-
ployed in the championships. Each
gunner will be allowed shots from
the prone, kneeling and standing
positions. “

The championship is sponsored
by the National Rifle Association
and the All-American board of
Riffledom and the Pitt shooters are
rated at a better than average
chance to finish high among the
leaders.

yet been decided what method will

more than likely, the men will be

the coaches desire a change, the

ﬁghters will be weighed in soon

Instead of putting upwards of
seventy-five candidates for the
football squad through the physical
drills which he had planned, Coach
Sutherland has had only the
chance for blackboard talks and
movies in the sessions which have
been held so far. The cold weath-
er which has held Pittsburgh in
its grip has held the squad indoors.

The movies were principally of
the Army and Nebraska games of
last year which turned out into
such walkaways for Pitt. The de-
fensive lineups of the opponents
were the emphasized items, how-
ever. Army used its halfbacks al-
most at the line of scrimmage, let-
ting its defense for forward pass
attack wide open. This nine man
line, though, by charging straight
in instead of converging to a point
bottled up. the Pitt running at-
_tack more effectively than any
other opponent.

The blackboard drills were of
the conventional type, Sutherland
bringing up hypothetical positions
and calling on various members of
the squad to answer. Some of the
replies indicated a hot fight for
the quarterbacking job next year.

Although there are only three
varsity men of last year back,
Sutherland is looking forward to
a good line and backﬁeld. From
two of the seniors in the squad,
especially, are great things expect-
ed. The players in question are
Pitt’s “poison twins,” Heller and
Captain-elect Reider.

If the spirit of the large squad
can be taken as a criterion for the
success of the team this fall, every
team on the Panther schedule will
have its hands full when it tangles
with the Golden Cats. One man in
the group, weighing 135 pounds, is
a candidate for a tackle berth.
And he has never played football
before. "

[Points will be awarded -on the
lbasis of ﬁve for winner, three for
the runnerup, and one for the win-
ner of the consolation bout. Gold
medals will be awarded the win-
ners in each class, and silver med-
als to the runnerups.

Large Crowd Expected.

A capacity crowd is expected to
tax the seating capacities of the
spacious Tech gym when the an-
nouncer introduces the ﬁghters for
the first bout.

There is plenty of good boxing
meat in all classes, but those in
the 155, 165 and 175 pound classes
seem to top the ﬁeld. Four good
men are represented in the first
two classes, and three in the 175
pound class. It will take a lot of
everything th,e ﬁghters have to
win the title in any of these events.

The other events do not lack
good ﬁghters, either, and as the
best boxers in the conference are
entered, the fans are in for a, real
evening.

Temple holds the edge in the
race for team points by having ﬁve
men entered. Pitt, Carnegie Tech,
West Virginia, and Bucknell each
have four entries, while Duquesne
and W. & J. end up with three
apiece.

D’Allessandro Favored.

In the 115 pound class, the title
should go directly to D’Al1essandro
(Temple). However, Wertz (Tech),
Vitulla (Duquesne), anél Terpolilli
(Bucknell), will be ‘ghting till
the ﬁnal gong rings.

Duquesne, W. & J., Temple, and
Bucknell each have one entry in
the 125 pound class in the persons
of Vernaccini, Morrisey, Eshleman,
and Boerner, respectively.

The 135 pound class, like the
others, has a. wealth of good mater-
ial. Santicola (Pitt), Helegers
(Tech), Belol‘f (Temple), and Ham-
ilton (West Virginia) will provide
the ﬁreworks for the two nights.
All these boxers seem evenly
matched and the results seem to
be a tossup.

Carr (Tech), Mo-ore (Duquesne),
Neely (West Virginia), and Rubbo
(Pitt). all high ranking men on
their respective teams, should put
up great fights in the next division.
All of these boxers have had plen-
TY Of experience during the past
season, and anything may happen.

Pi Lambda Phi Defeats
Mountaineer Frat

Pi Lambda Phi representing the
Pitt Interfraternity Council, de-
feated the Sigma Nu of West Vir-
ginia University, last Tuesday
night in a telegraphic champion-
ship bo-wling match. To Win the
match, the Pi Lambs compiled 3248
points in five games while the Sig-
ma Nu boys made a. total of 3095
points.

The match was between the in-
terfraternity champions of Pitt and
West Virginia University and the
winner received a cup. The Pi
Lambs in order to win the_Pitt
title had to fight its Way through
the stiff opposition of the other
fraternities in the league. This is
the second time in
that the Pi Lambs have won the
interfraternity championship. It is
also the second time that they have
defeated the West Virginia repre-
sentatives.

The Pi Lambs bowled at the
Neville-Watkins alleys. Theodore
Biddle, assistant dean of men,
supervised the games of the Pi
Lambs in the same style in which
he supervised the entire bowling
tournament.

The Pi Lamb team was compos-
ed of Leonard Linton, Lou Berman,
Jerry Rosenberg and Ben Weisman,
all of whom bowled fivegames and
Sam Sherman and “Bunny” de Mes-
quita, who split the five games be-
tween them.

The Pitt Greeks made the fol-
lowing scores in their five games:
535, 577, 637, 780 and 710. Len Lin-
ton made the highest score of any
Pi Lamb for a single game, bowling
192. Linton and Berman ranked
about even for the highest total
score.

The games were bowled at the
same time but at different places.
As soon as the teams had complet-
ed their bowling, their scores were
sent to the opposing team. The
scores were then compared and the
winner determined

 

so (Bucknell), and Osborne (W. &
J.) all seem ready to grab off the
title.

In the 165 pound class, some of
the hardest punchers in collegiate
circles will trade Wallops. The
unbeaten Demedowitz, (W. & J.),
is favorgd to grab oﬂ the major
portion of what glory is given out.
318881, Pitt’s number 1 man, Lath-
'am (West Virginia), and Men
(Temple), round out the quartet.

As only three men are entered
in the 175 Dound class, one will
draw _a bye for the opening night.
Hawkins (West Virginia), Waldron
(Tech). and Kubacki (Bucknell),
hope to draw down the referee’s
decision, but the result seems to

unemployed. Dr. Tyson argued
against Dr. Johnson's platform and
stated his own views.

The two main causes of the pres-
ent depression, Dr. Tyson said,
were a. defective monetary system
and the improper use of credit. and
an ineffective industrial system.
Included in the latter, is the con-
stant inequality of production and
consumption.

In conclusion Dr. Tyson suggest-
ed three economic -changes consist-
ing of:

1. A change in the technique of

labor organizations.

2. A change in the technique of

labor.

3. Changes to such economic

planning as can be accomplish-

ed without changing the funda-
mental b-asis, capitalism.

The second dance of the College
Association will be held at the
Schenley Hotel, Friday, April 8.
This dance is to be formal, the
other having been informal. Two
dances are held each -semester by
the Association.

The proceeds from the sale of
memberships for the College Asso-
ciation, of which Harold Cronin,
Col. '32, is president, are used as
loans for worthy students in the
College. ‘

The memberships, priced at two
dollars apiece, entitle the purchas-

which was held in February. About
fifty more memberships are still
for sale, and those desiring them
are urged to purchase them imme-
diately, according to Cronin.

Pun Wit _ .

“The pun is the highest form of
wit and only the educated and in-

fessor Frank P. Rand, of Massachu-
setts State. He maintains that it
takes real development of the mind
to see the subtle connections of
words and ideas. The professor
has probably been riding on trains
with a bunch of travelling sales-

Tootsie Strolling

Playing “nursemaids” to the off-
spring of Park and Fifth avenues
is not the only job that is occupy-
ing the time of Columbia men (as
the downtown extras stated.) The
story goes that the famous bad wo-
men, with good dogs who are sup-
posed to haunt Riverside Drive,
are taking less interest in their
Charges these days. Instead of per-
sonally superintending Tootsie’s
daily stroll, Columbia men now get

Necessity is the mother of inven-

I rooted in the medicine cabinet behind the heaps
of rusty razor blades and the crinkled tooth-paste
tubes‘ ﬁnally I found some of the pills that father
used to take when he had water on the knee- '
swallowed six or seven. “Perspiration,” some sage
once remarked, “is the pathway to success.” I went
to bed determined to perspire. I drank hot lemon
juice, smeared my muscles with lard and.turpentine,
and snuggled myself beneath a couple of feet of
patch quilts and Indian blankets. Whishl Ivly pores
were open. And it never rains but that It pores!

On another occasion, when I cut my foot with a Boy

I -‘.~:

Changes in the method of conduct-
ing Tap Day exercises, as endorsed
by Student Council recently,
were the subject of discussion this

week among members of the four
honorary activities fraternities con-
cerned in the proposed separation
of activities tapping assembly from
that of scholasticand professional
organizations.

Jean W. Davis, Col. ’32, president
of Mortar Board, Women’s national
honorary activities fraternity, saw
the proposed changes as a distinct
improvement over the present sys-
tem of having a single assembly
for all tapping exercises. She said:

“Probably the most pertinent
criticism of the present kind of Tap
Day assembly is that its length and
the lack of something to unify it
makes it boring and uninteresting.
Perhaps a well-planned assembly
for both groups, scholastic and ac-
tivities, each independent of the
other, would be beneﬁcial to both

. . In place of the present sys-
tem, a gala event outdoors with
color, music—the band, and glee
clubs~—and a balanced pnogram,
would be a. marked advance in Tap
Day assemblies.”'

Robert C. Machesney, president
of Omicron Delta Kappa, men’s
national honorary activities fra-
ternity, said:

“I-t would seem that the purpose
of a, tapping assembly should be
to provide a digniﬁed and impres-
sive exercise at which students

who have given signiﬁcant service
to the University will be honored.
Any procedure that will add to the
impressivéness of the occasion
should be encouraged. With an
earnest effort on the part of Stu-
dent Council and the honorary br-
ganizations, themselves, it will un-
doubtedly be possible to devise a.

The same feeling for a more in-
teresting Tap Day ceremony was
expressed by Dorothy Wanner,
Col. ’34, president of Cweps, wo-
men’s national honorary sopho-
more activities fraternity, who
said:

“I certainly favor a separate Tap
Day assembly for the four honor-
ary activities fraternities. The
plan, as I see it, ‘will be sure to
revive student interest in tapping

exercises, which in the past have.

been necessarily long
some.”

John Grove, Col. ’34, president of
Druids, men’s national honorary
sophomore fraternity, stressed the
fact that such a change would keep
announcements secret until the
time of the tapping ceremonies.

“In the past,” he said’ ctmuidg
has announced its tappees several
weeks in advance of the regular
Tap Day assembly, and consequent-
ly the only freshmen attending the
exercises were ‘those whose names
had been revealed.‘ Under the pro-
posed plan, the names of Druid
tappees will be withheld until the
