Two face
off in
president
debate

Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt'News

Current Student Government Board
member Matthew Riehle stood up
at the presidential debate Tuesday
night to pose a question to his fellow
SGB members and the prospective
presidents of next term’s Board —
what U.S. president do they best
identify with?

“Just because everyone says I
have this outrageous smile, I think
it would be pretty nice to see how I’d
look with wooden teeth,” saidJames
Landreneau, identifying with George
Washington.

Hasley cited Abraham Lincoln’s
gawky frame and penchant for sto-
rytelling as his reason for choosing
the 16th president of the United
States.

But it wasn’t all jokes Tuesday
night as Landreneau and Hasley
squared off in Nordy’s Place, discuss-
ing issues ranging from SGB’s rela-
tionship with both the student body
and administrators to their plans for
the next Board. Pitt students will cast
their vote for either Landreneau or
Hasley this Thursday, Nov. 17.

Kari Rosenkaimer, the chair of
SGB’s election committee, and cur-
rent SGB president Molly Stieber
moderated the hour-long debate,
with student audience members ask-
ing questions at the end. It took place
in front of about 20 students, with
current SGB members and prospec-
tive candidates making up nearly half

Students criticize Pitt police actions

Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

A Pitt student group has.criti-
cized the Pitt police for the de-
.partment’s handling of Occupy
Pittsburgh protesters trying to
enter the group’s public event two
weeks ago.

Students forJustice in Pales-
tine sent an open letter to Pitt
police chief Tim Delaney and ex-

ecutive vice chancellor Jerome

Cochran in which the group said
that when police temporarily
barred Occupy Pittsburgh pro-
testers from entering the student
group’s Nov. 2 public event, the
police were practicing “brazen
profiling” of Occupy Pittsburgh
protesters and labeled the ordeal
“incredibly disrespectful.”

J “The refusal of entry by Pitt
police was blatant discrimination
against Pittsburgh citizens who

choose to participate in the Oc-
cupy movement  SJP expects the
Pitt Police and the University to
respect the rights to legitimately
organize through the University

UPMC  
transplant
program
placed on
probation

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

The federal Organ Procurement
and Transplantation Network
placed UPMC’s transplant pro-
gram on probation Tuesday fol-
lowing a hepatitis C-infected
kidney transplant that the center
performed earlier this year.
UPMC voluntarily shut down
its living-donor kidney transplant
program in May after a recipient
received an infected kidney. The
program reopened in July when
the United Network for Organ
Sharing and the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services, fed-
eral agencies that oversee organ
transplants, both concluded fed-
eral investigations into UPMC’s

V transplant program.

After a board meeting on Mon-
day, OPTN’s Board of Directors
put UPMC onfprobation, signi-
fying that UPMC violated OPTN
policies and bylaws or had a seri-
ous lapse in patient safety. UPMC
is still permitted to conduct
transplants but with oversight
from UNOS.

The discipline comes after
UPMC performed a living-donor
kidney transplant that resulted in
the kidney recipient contracting
hepatitis C.

Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

On Tuesday night, the Student
Government Board held its last
meeting before the members of-
ficially become “lame ducks.”

The Board highlighted Thurs-
day’s elections at its weekly
meeting in Nordy’s Place at 8:45
p._m. Two Board members, se—
niors John Hasley andjames Lan-
dreneau, will return to the ballot,
battling it out for the presidential
position, while 16 other students
run for the eight Board member
seats.

The Board primarily allocates
money from the Student Activi-
ties Fee paid by every non—College

tral. The election’s results will be
announced at 9 p.m. in Nordy’s_
Place. 5 -

Board member Matthew Rie-
hle urged the audience, of about
12 students to prolmotelvoting to
their respective organizations
and help improve student voter
turnout.

“I really think 25 percent
voter turnout is an achievable
number,” Riehle said. “Talk to
your students - organizations,

“The most important thing we
can talk about is the election on

actions in his response but noted

aneed for an increase in com- _

munication between the police
and the administration about
such events. Cochran could not
be reached for comment.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele’s--

statement on the SIP event was
similar to Delaney’s response.

“Because Occupy Pittsburgh is
not a Pitt—related group, and be-
cause organizers of the meeting

vide a copy of the use permit for
the room, police initially limited
access to people who were able
to produce Pitt identification,”
he said in an email.

Occupy protesters to attend their

event “Confronting Apartheid!

Voices of the Joint Struggle” in
David Lawrence Hall from 8:30
to 11 p.m. The event followed a
two—hour Occupy protest through
Oakland. When the protesters at-
tempted to enter the Forbes Av-
enue doors that night, Pitt police
did not immediately permit the
entrance of about 20 protesters
and asked SJP to show proof that
the group had permission to hold
the event. After SJP provided a
copy of the room reservation and
the allocation approval from the
Student Government Board, Pitt
police allowed the approximately
10 remaining non—Pitt student
protesters into the event for an
hour. Pitt students with ID were
not barredhdfrom the event. _

Candidates talk allocation issues

Debate 4 3

'T‘i‘.I: M2“-r.xi‘e'H"«'~* and an “  ‘
julm ll

of the audience. 7
Both candidates discussed their
stance on the allocations process,

‘pledging to make changes if elect-

ed. ,
, Landreneau brought up revising

C the allocations manual each year to

keep up with changing precedents as
a key issue in his platform. Currently,
the Board sets precedents for alloca-
tions that aren’t always carried over

’ each year, thus causing confusion‘
for the student groups that request
6 money. '

He said he“felt that the Board
needs to keep student organizations
abreast‘ of its allocations policy.

“I’m actually totally in favor of
changing [the allocations manual]
every s'ingle’year,” Landreneau said.
“And that’s because as a new board
comes in, they bring in new prec-
edents, they bring in new thinking

. heads, and who’s to say the next eight

board members think the same that
I do?”

Hasley said he agreed that the al— ~

locations process requires constant
revision with the changing needs of

students.

The candidates also focused on _

voter turnout and general involve-
ment with SGB on the part of Pitt’s
student body.

Hasley said that as part of his

I campaigning, he has been spending ,

a lot of hours talking to students in
Market Central in an attempt to raise
lastyear’s 19 percentvoter turnout to
Rosenkaimer’s goal of 25 percent.

“Conversations that students
otherwise wouldn’t get if they’re
not involved in an organization;
I’ve tried to expose SGB to as broad
a cross-section of students as pos-
sible,” he said. « '

\‘ To further connect the Board and
students, Hasley has proposed public
oliice hours for both the Board mem-
bers and the president. Under his
platform, Hasley has proposed that
all members would have to spend a
minimum of two hours each week
in public places like the Litchﬁeld
Towers Lobby. I

Landreneau also hopes to make
the Board more accessible. He said
that if elected, he plans to imple-

ment monthly Pitt Hall meetings
that would allow students a chance
to bring up any issues or suggestions
they have before the Board.

“The open floor section that we
have occursafter [the weekly Tues-
day meeﬁngl, many students don’t
want to sit through allocations for
45 minutes and then make their
announcement here,” Landreneau
said. V

The candidates were particularly
concerned with the relationship
between Pitt students and the rest

1 V of the Oakland community. Hasley

emphasized his work with the In-
terfraternity Council, of which he is
currently president. As president of
IFC, he sat down with non—student
Oakland residents and drafted a
proposal to help create connections
between Pitt students and the com-
munity. '

. In addressing the relationship
with Pitt students and the rest of the
Oakland community, Landreneau
said the Board president can’t' ac-
complish anything on his own. If
elected, he said he willhbring the
student leaders together in an on-‘
campus summit to address the issues
together.

The two candidates emphasized
throughoutthe debate that they are
good friends and wore each other’s
campaign T-shirts to prove so.

Landreneau said that he feels
Hasley would make a great presi-
dent. He said that if he loses, he in-
tends to remain involved in student
government.

When asked what he would do if
he lost, Hasley said, “[I] would up-
date my Facebook status, ‘Congratu-
lations,]ames Landreneau. I’m proud
that you are my president-elect,’ and
I really do feel that way.” I

UPMC 4 1

Michael -Yocabet, the kidney
recipient, and Christina Mecan-
me, the kidney donor, ﬁled neg-
ligence lawsuits against UPMC
Presbyterian hospital on Sept.
21. The suit charges that UPMC

knew of the infected kidney and‘

allowed the procedure to go on.
After the kidney transplant,
UPMC added new steps in the
transplant process, consisting of
redundancies so that more people
look at the screenings before the
transplant occurs, UPMC spokes-
woman Jennifer Yates said.

“[The probation] gives UNOS
the opportunity to make sure
we’re putting our plan into place
and that it’s working,” Yates
said.

She said the probation serves
as oversight and allows UNOS to
keep a close eye on the program,
monitor the transplant process
and make sure everything is
working as it should. ‘

OPTN/UNOS president John
Lake said in a statement released
Tuesday that the probation comes
after a series of medical peer re-

views.

“The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has identified a
need for process improvement
in communicating key clinical in-
formation among transplant staff
members. While the center has

' acted quickly and responsibly to

identify and implement a correc-
tive action plan, we believe proba-
tion is warranted,” he said.
Yates said that UPMC expected
some sort of action from UNOS
and is welcoming their oversight

‘of the program. I

After PSU, public,

has ‘right to know’

It’s time that Pennsylvania citi-
zens have the right to know.

The Right to Know Law is an
open records law that provides
public access to public informa-
tion. And the four state-related
universities in Pennsylvania —
Pitt, Penn State, Temple and Lin-
coln — are exempt in crucial ways

from the state Right to Know Law,
whereas the state’s public schools
must comply with the law.

Although the state-related
universities are different from
those that are part of the State
System of Higher Education —
state-related tuitions are higher,
and they receive less money from
the state — they are still public
entities that are wrongfully ex-
empt from the law.

Any cent an organization re-
ceives from the public should be
properly documented, its pur-
pose should be laid out in simple
language and budgets should be
readily available to the public.
After all, don’t we deserve to
know where taxpayer money is
going?

There have been rumblings
of adjusting the Right to Know
Law to include the state-related
universities, and we think that
potential legislation couldn’t
come soon enough.

With the events unfolding at
Penn State, said legislation would
be timely. Former assistant foot-
ball coach Jerry Sandusky was
charged with 40 counts of sexual
assault toward eight children.
With those involved trying to
defend themselves and several
administrators under national
scrutiny, the truth would come to
light much sooner if the school’s
records were available to the
public.

Most recently, assistant coach
and key witness in the Sandusky
case Mike McQueary has been
placed on paid leave from the
university. According to The
Patriot-News, he claims he told
university police about what he

saw. This contradicts the grand
jury report, which states, “[Mc—
Queary] was never questioned by
University police and no other
entity conducted an investiga-
don?

With so many people affected.

and wanting to clear their names,
what better way to bring quick
justice than making university
records available to the public?
Unfortunately, the Penn State

scandal can’t be helped now, but -  i

if the university had been sub-
jected to the Right to Know Law
beforehand, the scandal could
have come to light earlier and
justice very well might have been
served. V

It’s likely there would have
been written documents. Even
if not, the unfortunate events

at Penn State indicate that the.

state-related schools cannot op-
erate effectively without state
oversight. .

More than ever before, past,
present and future students
should have the right to know
what’s going on at their universi-
ties. The value of their degrees is
tied to their respective universi-
ties’ reputations, which are al-
ways in ﬂux. The successes of the
schools that operate under the
Right to Know Law are a clear
indicator that open record poli-
cies do not prevent universities
from excelling. If anything, it’s
commendable that their records
are available. It would take a lot
of effort to prevent something
akin to the Penn State scandal
from leaking to the public. In es-
sence, it would be an honorable
policy for a school to adopt, even
if the law did not require it.

By exempting state-related
schools from the Right to Know
Law, our ability to function as
students is crippled. We are hurt
by what we don’t know, as evi-
denced to an extreme degree in
the middle of the state.

We’ve had it with all the se-
crecy. Open the books. I

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

ds decision

 

 

 

Keystne XL nee

 

 
    
 

Matt Schaff
Columnist

I’m torn. Last week, the Obama ad-
ministration punted its decision on
the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Sure, it’s
nice to have a president who doesn’t
share his bed with energy company
executives. But at the same time, I
think Barack Obama’s making a mis-
take. ' -

It’s been three years since Tran-
sCanada, a major Canadian energy
infrastructure company, applied for a
presidential permit to begin the pro—
posed $7 billion KeystoneXL project.
If granted, this permissionwould give
TransCanada the right to build and
operate an extension of 1,700 miles
of oil pipeline, which would speed
500,000 barrels of Canadian crude
oil per day to U.S. reﬁneries along the
Gulf of Mexico. TransCanada pur-
ports that the project would generate
20,000 “high-wage” jobs, the eco-
nomic analysis ﬁrrn the Perryman
Group suggests that direct consu‘uc-
tion spendingwould add $9.6 billion
to the GDP and esteemed energy’
economistjames Hamilton estimates
the pipeline could lower fuel costs for
a large section of the country — that
alone boasts a potential yearly GDP
boost of $3.6 billion.

But given the vast stretches of
American heartland over which the

pipewill weave and the fact that Cana-
dian energy production, which takes
oilfrom hard-to-process sand depos-
its, releases more CO2 than conven-
tional methods, environmentally con-
scious observers around the country
have thrown red  That includes
Pitt students. Just last month, the
Pittsburgh Student Environmental
Coalition protested the Keystone XL
pipeline in South Side; where Obama
visited to touthis now-defunct jobs
bill, according to The Pitt News.
And if the story the mainstream
media’s spinning — that the years
of delays to the pipeline’s construc-

‘ tion derive from Obama bending to
. pressure from environmental groups,

as opposed to legitimate concerns
that haven’t yet been resolved in the
drawn-out investigation — is true,
then it looks like these critics have
sidestepped the best interest of the
country and ﬁ‘ankly, of the presi-
dent. ,

Don’t write me off too early —
protecting the environment should
be a national imperative. We need to
ensure that the bountiful resources
andwildlife ofNorthAmericaare still
around for future generations to en-
joy. And perhaps, especially inRepub—
lican circles, there’s not enough said
about the value inherent in Mother
Nature operating undisturbed. But
even with  appreciation for the
Earth, we have to realize that all-out

bans on selected economic activities
that affect the environment, which
the deliberate Keystone XL delays
amount to, don’t accomplish any-
thing constructive. When faced with
decisions that carry environmental
risks, we should resist the automatic

urge to use the stick-our-heels—in-the— _

(tar)-sand card.

Without some allowance forpollu—
tion and environmental disturbance,
at least in this century, Americans
would not be enjoying the quality of
life we take for granted. For example,
think about all the fossil fuels that
went into putting this publication
into your hands. Likewise, pursuing

policy that rejects — or indeﬁnitely -

withholds permission for — devel-
opment projects that promise wide-
ranging beneﬁts but’ happen to risk
any amount of environmental cost
is economic stupidity. Anyone who
expects to use infrastructure invest-
ment as an economy booster without
disturbing our natural surroundings
is naive.

The only feasible policy for pro— A

posals like Keystone XL is cost mini-

- mization, and this is what Obama

needs to realize. That’s because eco-
nomic stimulus with manageable side
effects beats no stimulus and no side
effects.

Although the laughable lineup

tell you otherwise, Obama’s hold on
the 2012 election is anything but

certain. With tens of millions of still- -

unemployed voters breathing down
his neck, Obama would be foolish to
dismiss opportunities for the private

‘sector to put people to work, espe-

cially at a time when Congress won’t
move on any substantial iteration of
Obama’s jobs bill. The Democrats
need a stronger job market to assure
victory in 2012 — it mightbe just me,

structionist Republicans’ faul ” line
seems too ﬂimsy to carryapresiden—
tial campaign.

V So if he wants to continue living
in the White ‘House, Obama cannot

_ go around turning proposals like
Keystone XL down outright. And he *

needs to recognize that approving
such pipelines doesn’t have to com-
promise his values unless his values
are actually impossible ideals. In-
stead of eliminating the possibility

reaucratic lag, Obama should focus
on building a regulatory system that
minimizes these risks.

How could he do this‘? One word
— incentives. If he gives companies
like 'I‘ransCanada both permission
to use American land and a‘ strong
incentive to reduce environmental
impact, along with vigorous regula-
tory monitoring, he’ll ﬁnd awin-win
scenario: The company economy and
president will beneﬁt, and environ-

So what’s a sample incentive solu-
tion? Tax companies based on the size
of their environmental impact. Using
some to—be—developed formula, com-
panies would have to pay — above
and beyond cleanup costs when ac-
cidents strike — given the amount of
CO2 released, thenumber of species
displaced, the probability of contami-
nating ground water, etc. If the price
of pollutingis sufﬁciently high, ﬁrms

_ would have the incentive to do every-

5 .

lessen companies’ footprints

— the tax, which happens to include
enhancing the “greenness” of their
operations. It’s just too easy.

What would be easier, of course, is
to use amagic wand to lower the per-
unit cost of solar power, thus swiftly
eliminating our reliance on ditty fuels
and hostile foreigners. But as we all
know, governments are in no ﬁscal
shape to raise appropriations to Hog-
warts’ research department.

not the size that matters, it’s how-

you use it.” To test this rule, Iwent up
to my friend — bright and early, at
about 8 a.m. — and asked, “What’s
your position on penis size?” “I don’t
know,” she answered, “I’m not as
sick as you, Leah.”fI knew that she
was more irritated by the time of
day than the question, so I admitted
to her, “I’m not entirely sure how I
want to present this column.”
After she realized I needed an
actual opinion, one that she would
probably more readily give at a later
time after some caffeine, she said,
“Oh, it matters. But it’s conditional.
It only really matters if it’s minis-
cule.” And with that I’m going to

The problem with that overused

to make every guy feel as if they
don’t have to be body conscious.
But here’s the thing, boys. Girls are
self-conscious every day about, well,

everything — our faces, hair, hips,‘

stomachs, boobs, butt and vaginas.
So you don’t need to feel out of the
ordinary if you worry about the way
your penis looks. It’s a part of life.

. ..,two that is important when it comes

to getting down in the bedroom.
The only truth to that quote is that,
like my friend already stated, the
size issue is dependent upon how
extreme the problemis.

Size really only matters if your
member is tremendously tiny or
extremely enormous. Let’s obtain
a starting point here. Askmen.com
shows the results of a worldwide
study published in BJU Internation-
al, “Penile Size and the ‘Small Penis
Syndrome,”’ by Kevan R. Wylie and
Ian Eardley. This study shows that
the average erect sizeof the adult
penis is between 5.5 inches and 6.2
inches _in length and between 4.7
inches and 5.1 inches in-girth.

If you are someone who is truly
concerned about this, excuse your-
self and ﬁnd some measuring tape.
To be considered average, your pe-
nis length and thickness should fall

‘ somewhere in this range. I would

say that it’s probably okay if it is an
inch or so below average. I think I
can speak for everybody when I say
that it would be preferable if it were
larger than a baby carrot or a golf
pencil. If you’re packin’ something
that size or smaller, I don’t mean- to

‘KdIIl)I'lIlPdl¢lﬂ

be harsh. But here’s the sad truth:
Whoever you’re having intercourse
with might not actually be able to
feel it.

On the other hand, I think you
all know that bigger is, in this case,
the better of the two. There is a ful-
ﬁlling aspect to a nice-s'ized penis.
I can’t ‘explain the exact reasoning
behind it. It’s almost as if a larger
penis seems more aroused and, as
a result, makes the partner more
excited. However, there is such a
thing as too big. Nine or 10 inches
is pushing it and can be painful. And
no one likes a guy that knows his
penis is big. It’s a complete turn-
off to be overly conﬁdent when it
comes to sex.

Don’t be too upset about all this.
The same study surveyed more than
50,000 heterosexual couples and
found that “85 percent of women
were satisﬁed with their partner’s
penile size, but only 55 percent
of men were satisﬁed” with their
own size. That says it all. Penis size
matters, but it’s not at the top of
the list. Just like any body part that
a woman might be self-conscious
about, you’re going to notice it more
than any partner will. Don’t fret over

If you know you have a smaller

area. If you’re on the large side, try
The Slide. You kneel and your part-
ner faces you with her pelvis off the
ground. Or.there’s always doggie
style, which allows the receiver to
control penetration if need be.

There you go, guys. There’s the

more important to know how to use
it. We’ll take notice of the effort.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Panthers defeat St. Francsis, earn first win of season

Jon Anzur
Staﬁ‘ Writer

In the time between Pitt’s season
opener on Saturday and the team’s
victory over St. Francis on Tues-
day night, Ashlee Anderson seem-
ingly transformed into a different
player.

The redshirt sophomore fol-
lowed her scoreless performance
against Hampton with a career-
high 29 points against the Red
Flash, leading the Pitt women’s

- basketball team to a 78-50 win, the

team’s ﬁrst victory of the season.

Despite a rough start to the sea-
son , Anderson said her record-
setting scoring against the Red
Flash didn’t surprise her.

“I was just trying to do the
things that I know I’m capable
of doing to help the team win,”
Anderson said. “I’ve got a lot of
conﬁdence in my coaching staff
and a lot of conﬁdence in my team-
mates. That was where a lot of my
intensity and a lot of my scoring
came from.” _

Although she said that it’s im-
portant for every player to contrib-
ute, head coach Agnus Berenato
acknowledged that Anderson’s
production is special.

“When Ashlee goes to the rack,
she goes to the rack with author-
ity,” Berenato said. “Everyone out
there on the court knew who Ash-
lee Anderson was tonight.”

Berenato added that Anderson’s
all-around performance dictates
how the rest of her team plays.

“Ashlee’s play will become con-
tagious,” she said. “I think at the
same time, Ashlee’s lack of play is
contagious as well. Tonight, she
just let the game come to her.”

Anderson went 13-20 from the
ﬁeld against the Red Flash, spend-
ing most of her night battling in
the paint. She ﬁnished with eight
rebounds.

The Panthers got off to a sloppy
start, turning theball over on four
of their ﬁrst six possessions. The

' Red Flash increased the pressure

by switching to ‘a ﬁill-court man-
to-man press ﬁve minutes into the
game. Pitt turned the ball over on
its next possession. I ‘
But the Panthers adjusted
quickly, generating easy layupsout
of double teams on back-to-back

trips before redshirt sophomore
Abby Dowd knocked down a wide-
open 3—pointer. Dowd ﬁnished with
15 points.

Pitt also began pressing mid-
way through the half. The pressure
caused most of St. Francis’ 13 ﬁrst-
half turnovers — half of their total
for the game.

The Panthers seized on the
Red Flash’s mistakes. Leeza Burd-

gess’ layup began a 21-10 run that ' -
' was capped off by another Dowd

3—pointer seconds before the half
ended.~ V ‘ . - 

Pitt led 35-22 at halftime.-...

St. Francis came out of the
locker strong, scoring two quick
baskets to decrease Pitt’s lead to
eight. But the Panthers continued
to exploit the Red Flash’s shaky
press, and Dowd hit an uncontest-
ed 3—pointer to put the Panthers
back up by 11.

- From there the score was never
close. ‘I

Brianna Kiesel nearly logged a
triple-double for the Panthers. The
freshman point guard, who owns
four of her high school’s al1—time
records, ﬁnished with 17 points,
eight assists and nine rebounds in
her second collegiate game.

Kiesel said that transitioning to
the college game from high school
is “a little tough at times” but that
having Anderson as a teammate
helps.

“The transition from high
school to college was huge,” she
said. “After every game, I have to
review tape so I can get better. I
think I’m doing a little bit better
keeping up with everyone. Plus we
have Ashlee, who’s a leader.”

Pitt shot 47 percent from the
ﬁeld while holding St. Francis to a
meager 27 percent. The Red Flash
managed three baskets in the sec-
ond half.

Pitt hosts Loyola (Md.) on Fri-
day at 11 a.m.

victory over the Rider Broncs on
Sunday.

The 49ers —— expected to

‘LBSU head coach Dan Monson

“[The] biggest thing you have
to do is just stay in there, because
they are going to come in there

then we can worry about beat-

No. 9 Pitt (2-0) defeated Rider
86-78 in its second game of the

a fast start, the Panthers grew
sloppy on offense and lackluster
on defense. The combination led
to Rider tying the game at 45 by
halftime, erasing Pitt’s early 30-

FOOTBALL

Fitzgerald leads -
Cardinals to win
over Eagles   “

Greg Trietley
Stajfwri ter

Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt wide re-
ceiver, 2002-2003) had a sea-
son-high 146 receiving yards and
two touchdowns Sunday against
Philadelphia’s underperform-
ing secondary when his Arizona
Cardinals handed the Eagles a
21-17 loss. With his two scores,
the 70th and 71st of his career,
he surpassed Roy Green for the
most career touchdowns in the
franchise’s 91-year history.

Fitzgerald’s teammate LaRod
Stephens-Howling (Pitt run-
ning back, 2005-2008) strug-
gled between the tackles against
Philadelphia, losing a yard on
his only carry. The versatile run-
ning back, though, made two
catches out of the backfield for
39 yards. '

LeSean McCoy (Pitt running
back, 2007-2008) had 81 yards
and a touchdown on the ground
for the Eagles in the defeat. Mc-
Coy has scored in every game this
year and is 94 rushing yards shy
of his second consecutive 1,000-
yard season, but Philadelphia is
3-6.

McCoy’s teammate Dion Lewis
(Pitt running back, 2009-2010)
carried the ball once against Ari-
zona for a modest 2—yard gain.
Lewis, one of four Pitt alumni
featured in.the Cardinals-Eagles
game, also returned two kicks
for 55 yards.

Tyler Palko (Pitt quarter-
back, 2002-2006) will make
his first career NFL start when
his Chiefs play at New England
Monday night. He had 47 yards
passing Sunday against the Bron-
cos in relief of Matt Cassel, who
left the game with an injured
throwing hand.

“We feel good about Tyler or
he wouldn’t be here as our num-
ber two quarterback,” Chiefs

.he‘ad'coach Todd Haley,said in a

press conference Monday. “I have

. belief in Tyler. In his case,:there is

not a lot of regular seasonaction

to go on, but I feel like he’s done
a great job while he’s been here
of developing and getting better.
He has a great understanding of
how our offense works and what
his role within it is.”

Jonathan Baldwin (Pitt wide
receiver, 2008-2010) had one
catch for.15 yards in Kansas City’s
17-10 loss to Denver Sunday.“

1 Baldwin, though, made a circus

catch in the second quarter when
he reached around safety Brian
Dawkins and pinned the ball
to the defender’s back as they
fell to the ground, but an illegal
formation penalty’ negated the
reception.

Darrelle Revis (Pitt corner-
back, 2004-2006) held Wes
Welker to 46 yards receiving, ‘
but Tom Brady torched the Jets’_
defense for 329 yards and three‘
touchdowns. Revis’ New York
Jets lost to New England 37-16
in a battle for first place in the
AFC East.

“We speak about a lot of things
here, and how we want to be as a
team, as a defense, and tonight,
there were just too many mis-
takes for us_ and it cost us,” Revis
said in a press conference after
the game.

Aaron Berry (Pitt defensive
back, 2006-2009) had four tack-
les, and the Lions’ secondary lim-
itedjay Cutler to 123 yards pass-
ing, but Chicago returned two
interceptions for touchdowns to
throttle Detroit, 37-13.

Clint Session (Pitt lineback-‘S
er, 2004-2006) had a tackle for a
loss in]acksonvil1e’s 17-3 victory
over winless Indianapolis.

Andy Lee (Pitt punter, 2000-
2003) had three punts for a 54.7-
yard average in San Francisco’s,.,
seventh straight win, this one
over the Giants, 27-20.

New York’s Henry Hynoski
(Pitt fullback, 2008-2010)
missed his fourth consecutive
game with a neck injury that he
suffered in a»-.Week 5 collisionh‘

‘A Christmas Story’ always tops holiday basketball

Trietley 4 6

Lakers hats and insist that they
have been lifelong Los Angeles fans
“through all the ups and downs”
will remain staggeringly high.
The amount of sound defensive
play seen on professional courts
will stay at “nonexistent” for all
teams except for San Antonio.
The Spurs, as the pioneers of the
revolutionary and unique “hands-

up” defense, will see the quality ’
of their play in their own end sig— .

niﬁcantly decline in the absence
of actual games.

On that note, the number of
NBA rebounds per game for,.for—
mer Connecticut center and over-
all “lanky man” Hasheem Thabeet
will continue at 0.0, or one Blu-
tarsky.

Informative LeBron James
comments will also stay at a rigid
zero throughout the lockout. The
number of uninformative com-
ments, though, will increase at a
hyperbolic rate as time_approaches

» inﬁnity.

The decision to watch “A
Christmas Story” over Christmas

Day basketball will not waver.
League management will stay
the course as far as marketing is
concerned. Black—and—white com-
mercials that feature dramatic,
building music and slow—motion
clips of ﬁst pumps and ancillary
pregame moments will remain a
staple of primetime sports net-
work breaks, since, as the popular
slogan goes, the game itself “re—
ally isn’tthat great,” regardless of
whether or not one is played.
The disbanding of the players’
association will allow for players
to continue acting in the individu-

‘ alistic, narcissistic manner that

fans often witnessed in game ac-
tion. . L

The National Hockey League,
Major League Soccer, National
League Lacrosse and other leagues
whose seasons at least partially
overlap basketball’s will hope that
meandering fans will migrate to
their sport. Unfortunately, though,
the number of fans of NHRA Drag
Racing will not increase or de-
crease. I

Kobe Bryant, above,'and the Los Angeles Lakers might not play any games this season, but that doesn’
" ’ V " V mean that the sports world as a whole will change.

‘‘It’s what We expect,” Gibbs said of
Woodall’s performance this season. “It’s
nothing new. He just took what the defense
gave him.” '1‘

The 49ers tend to push the ball due to

' their stellar guard play, but Idaho showed

that LBSU struggles in the half—court of-
fense. Monson said the 49ers must play

 

Everyone has to be gei-

iing belier every day. Each

freshman, each senior, each _

iunior, each sophomore.

—Jamie Dixon

better in order to have a chance at the
upset over Pitt. ‘

“You have to go in there with the mind-‘
set to win,” Monson said. “It’ll be a whole
different environment, a whole different
game, and we know we have to play better
than that to beat Pittsburgh.”

Pitt’s defense, star power and even the
Oakland Zoo won’t easily phase the 49ers,
who often play a tough nonconference
schedule. This year is no different.

LBSU will face No. 9 Pitt as well as No.
1 North Carolina, No. 8 Louisville, No. 12
Kansas and No. 13 Xavier.

After an underwhelming performance
against Rider, Dixon said that the Panthers
have to continue to work and improve,
particularly defensively. The Broncos shot
53.6 percent from the field against Pitt and

 

1 scored 45 points in the first half.

“Everyone has to be getting better ev-
ery day,” Dixon said. “Each freshman, each
senior, each junior, each sophomore.”

The Panthers and 49ers will tip off at 9
p.m. tonight at the Petersen Events Center.
The game will be nationally televised on
ESPNU. I‘
