. The last Student Government Board
meeting for the 2000 board was ﬁlled
with laughter, tears and thank-yous from
board and committee members.

About 30 students attended the
meeting, which lasted nearly an hour.
Those present reflected on the year and
expressed gratitude to those who helped
them. I

Some work did get done, though.
Proposed bylaw changes were passed,
as well as anew amendment that out-
lines a plan of action should an SGB
board member resign. V 

The amendment provides that, in
the case of a board member’s resigna-
tion, the board President will initiate a
two-week public search process, mak-
ing the vacancy known to all non-CGS
students.‘ ‘

The amendment calls for at least

one town hall meeting to be held in-

order to judge the candidates’ qualiﬁca-

tions. After that, the position will be.

ﬁlled by a two—thirds vote of the remain-
ing board members.
All the changes will be implement-

ed on the first ‘day of classes for the

spring term.

At , her last public meeting,
President Joan Snyder expressed her
gratitude’ and‘ tried to hold back her
tears. ,

“I wanted to say thank you to all of
you. It was an incredible year. You let
me _be open about my feelings all year
and I thank those of you who shared
their feelings with Inc,” Snyder said.

Snyder, who asked that board mem-
bers and committee "chairs submit a
report summarizing their activities for
the entire year, stated that there was

Finalsweek anxiety leaves

ERIN LINDEMAN A I

. » Staff Writer:_

Most students experience higher
levels of stress during ﬁnals week.

According to Dr. Katherine, Shear,
a Pitt professor of psychiatry and the

. director of the Anxiety: _pDisorders~
- Prevention Program, 'ai1xiéty".at__;__<te,st
time is completely normal. In faet","'th‘eT=='

added stress may even be helpful to
many students.

Shear recommends that students
use the anxietypto help them study and
prepare for ﬁnals, rather than allowing
it to become a hindrance.

Shear said, however, that it is
important for students to be aware of
the warning signs that indicate an anx-
iety disorder.

I The first sign is that the anxiety has
intensiﬁed to the point that it interferes
with everyday activities, such as dri-
ving a car or going to class. Another
warning sign is chronic anxiety, lasting

~'r«./q.-.rr—

longer than expected. According to
Shear, typical test anxiety should begin

‘ one to two weeks before the examina-
tion. ’ '

There are three main types of anxi-

ety disorders. that students need to be

aware of during exam time.
The first type," known as general-

V ized anxiety disorder, is characterized

by extreme feelings: of anxiety that
appear due to exams and other life
stresses. With this disorder, people can
experience sudden and unexpected
panic attacks.

“This type of anxiety disorder-’is
very treatable And only about 20 per-
cent of the cases are clinica ,” Shear
said. ‘ '

Stress also aggravates generalized
anxiety disorder.

“Everyone will worry some, but if '
it becomes uncontrollable, that’s a sign’

of an anxiety disorder,” Shear said.
, Kristin Rininger, a Pitt junior
majoring in communications and polit-

ical science, has been worried about

students stressed for tests

finals‘ since the week before
Thanksgiving.

“I knew I had so much to do and
not a lot of time to do it in,” Rininger
said. “I’m worried I won’t get every-
thing done_,in time.”

She said she often has difficulty
sleeping during ﬁnals week, an indica-.
tor to Shear that stress and anxiety. are
taking over Rininger’s body. ’

Social anxiety disorder, which falls
under the generalized anxiety category,
often causes physical stress on the
body. With social anxiety, a person is
often scared of being criticized of their
performance in social situations.

If a student takes oral examina-

’ tions, and is so nervous that for weeks

in advance they can’t function normal-
ly, it is a strong sign of a social-anxiety.
The second type of disorder is

obsessive-compulsive disorder, charac- '

terized by‘ frequently recurring and
uncontrollable‘ anxiety-producing
thoughts. Students whose study habits
seem repetitive or ritualistic, such as

reading every chapter of a textbook
multiple times, regardless of whether
the material was understood, may suf-
fer from OCD.

The third type of anxiety disorder
is panic disorder, which is character-
ized by rapid-onset attacks of extreme
fear and severe symptoms of stress,
such as heart palpitations and shortness
of breath. These symptoms seem to
appear out of nowhere, without a spe-
ciﬁc cause.

For some students, anxiety; levels
increase due to their own catastrophic
thoughts. Students often ponder their
ﬁnal grade and worry about failing a
particular class.

According to Shear, worrying
about failing a class is pointless for
most students, because the probability
of actually failing is low.

“Try to identify what’s making you
so anxious,” Shear said.

Shear provided many helpful tips

Staff Writer

In a small assisted~living home
in the Pittsburgh suburb of
Manchester, 20-year-old Jocelyn
Tussey brought 86-year-old Elsie
Jackson a pie and stack of Pitt News
issues.

“She’s allergic to just about
everything,” said Tussey, a thin,
blond woman with short hair. “You
have to watch what you give her.
You’ll be amazed

gaining from having college students
visit and run errands for them. But a
lot of the time, you’ll find it’s the
college students who find they get
more out of the experience.”
“There’s a missing ‘link in fami-
lies,” said Dr. Sally Newman, an
active senior citizen and the founder
of Generations Together. “I think a
lot of kids want someone who’1l sit
and- listen to them. My generation
has patience, time and often the
same interests and concerns as ado-
lescents. Older adults who want to
stay vital won’t

at how skinny she
is when you see
her,” Tussey said.

Jackson could
certainly be
described as thin.

interact with
youth.”

“They’ re so

' smart,” said

junior Melisa

Price, who partic-
ipated in the pro-

hair, which is graying and is styled
above her ears. _

“She always asks me to bring the
papers,” Tussey said. “She always
reads them all and talks tome about
them the next time I come.”

Tussey and Jackson have been a
pair for a year and a half though

Generations Together, a program’

that fosters generation-spanning
relationships between Pittsburgh’s
past and future. Though Jackson and
other seniors appreciate the pro-
gram, there are also great benefits
for the younger generation who
share in the experience.

For the college students in
Generations Together, the rewards
are numerous. Some medical stu-
dents see it as a springboard for later
work with geriatric patients.

While Pitt doesn’t require stu-
dents to volunteer, no one can ‘dis-
pute that a few well-logged volun-
teer hours won’t look good to a

’ potential graduate school or employ-

er. But while Generations Together
can do great things for the resume, it
can also do good things for the soul.

“For the Generations Together
program to be successful, it needs to
be mutually beneficial,” said Jim
McCrea, director of youth programs
for Generations Together. “It’s easy
to see what the elderly people are

gram last year. “Everything I’d gone.

through, my partner had been
through herself. It’s better to get
advice from people who’ve been
there and seen it themselves,” Price
esaid. '
For Jackson, ' whose
remains sharp, conversation domi-
nates much of Tussey’s visits.
“Well, we certainly don’t tango,”
Jackson said with a laugh as she held

up a silver cane. Jackson has arthri-'

tis that has slowed her legs and
shriveled her left hand.
“We mostly talk, watch TV

sometimes. I’m a big fan of court TV '

shows, like that one lady,” she said.

“Judge Judy,” Tussey piped in,
giggling. V ' A

Even though Jackson claimed
she manipulated the conversation,
Tussey insisted she appreciates the
time she spends with her friend.

“Are you going to come over for
Thanksgiving?” Tussey asked. (“My
grandma’s going to be there.”

“She keeps promising she’ll
come over. You aren’t going to break
your promise in front -of a reporter,
are you Elsie?” Tussey asked.

Later Tussey i talked about
Jackson as if she were a proud
grandchild. “She talks about

Michelle, Laurie (other Generation
Together volunteers) and me as her
grandchildren. I don’t’ think a lot of
people have the patience to work
with the elderly. I love hearing their
stories. And they give great advice,”
she said.

Tussey related an example from
last year when she struggled in a par-
ticular class.

“For some reason, the teacher

-- didn’t like me. I’d hand in a paper

and shc’d just rip it apart. So every
week, I’d come to Elsie and just vent
in front of her. And she was always
very supportive,” Tussey said.

“She told ,mev that there will
always be people who hate you, and
I think because of her color she’s
found a lot of that in her life. She
told me to just stick it through,”
Tussey added. ‘

Tussey is not alone in her appre-
ciation for the elderly. According to
Newman, in areas of Pennsylvania
Where volunteering is required for
graduation, 65 percent of students
opt to work with the elderly.

“There are a lot of myths about
young people who can’t understand
and work with the elderly,” said
Newman. “In truth all of our volun-
teers are marvelous.” A

Jackson knows about being a
good citizen. '

“I’vc dedicated 40 years to help-
ing people,” she said, reeling off a
list of causes and charities where she
worked. She worked with various
soup kitchens, Meals on Wheels and
KidsLine, a phone ‘service for
latchkey children where Jackson
once recorded 500 hours of volun-
teer service in a single year.

“I think it’s nice now that some-
one can do somet_hing for me,”
Jackson said, apparently unaware of
her own contributions to Tussey’s
life. A

“Meeting with the young people,
it really keeps me going,” Jackson
concluded. “I’ve always liked young
people, and I still like them. I really
like to learn from them.” .

“She’s really like another grand-
mother for me,” Tussey said.
“Having a link to the past is very
important and she’si really a very
special link to have.”

- Have a plan for studying and
stick to it. Be sure the plan contains
realistic, reachable goals.

“If these tips don’t help relieve
some anxiety, it’s another indicator that
the anxiety is out of control,” Shear
said.

Some students aren’t "affected by
the prospect of final exams.

“Finals mean I’m going home for

break very soon,” said Pitt sophomore‘

Allan Tinkey.

Tinkey’s first final is tomorrow
night and he has yet to begin studying
for it. He is an athletic training major.

Several candidates for board said
during the, election that a" newsletter
would help SGB relate to the students
what the committees and the board were

has dealt with, “this one has been the

_p Snyder said that after her presiden-
cy, she will work on the First Year

with college life. The program includes
sponsoring events and allowing fresh-
men to interact with upperclassmen.

“I’ll deﬁnitely be able to help with
transition for the new board,” she said.
“I’ll also help the new president pro-
tempore coordinate the student forums.”

Snyder will also continue working
on the Pitt Traditions forum with Vice
Provost for Academic Affairs Jack
Daniel. ’

Creative ways to banish stress  

It often seems that the last week of
classes is more stressful than the irnrr1i-
nent slew of ﬁnals. During ﬁnals week
you don’t have class, but during this
week you’re forced to juggle a busy
schedule that often includes a lot of
anxiety-inducing projects, papers and
assessments.

So if you’re singing the pre-ﬁnals
blues, The Pitt News recommends
some ways to help you change your
tune:

- Look at pretty things, such as the
holiday decorations Downtown, pup-
pies, ﬂowers, sunsets and attractive
celebrities in magazines.‘

- Hop aboard the cultural bus,
l7U, and relieve stress by immersing
yourself in great works of art at places
like the perpetually hip Andy Warhol
Museum.

- Buy something. Get your holi-
day shopping done at Pittsburgh’s
many ﬁne retail establishments, or just
purchase an amusing trinket for your-
self, such as a Slinky.

- Indulge in the most mind-numb-
ing activity you can think of, whether
that be playing video games or watch-
ing cheesy sitcoms about the scan-
dalous lives of trendy high—schoolers.

° Get a haircut. It’s the end of the
semester and you probably need one.

- Clean your roorrr, wash the dish-

es and do your laundry. These activities

for our trip by borrowing ﬁorn family friends. I
recall how at times‘ it seemed as if we would
never make it to the United States because my
dad didn’t really want us to go because he did not
think my mother would ever return.

I have three older sisters, two of whom had
been in the United States for two years, and one,
the oldest, who had been there for about seven
years. My two brothers lived with me in Nigeria.
They looked at me in awe when I was chosen to
accompany my mom to the Great
Land. They didn’t understand that
the only reason I was going was
because I was the youngest and
needed my mom the most.

Iwas 8 years old, and eventhoughlhadbeen
to the United States twice before, this time was
different The first time I was a baby and the sec-
ond time I was 2. This time was diﬂerent because
I could remember. Not only do I remember the
big things, but I also remember the minute details.

I remember believing, in my childish mind,
that the United States was heaven. All of the
young and some of the old people I knew wanted
to be there, in the land of opportunities. They all
made it sound as if once you made it to America,
you would have absolutely no worries, as if
America was the answer to. everything. A ‘

Second, I thought tobe heaven,
because you had to ﬂy through the clouds to get
there. As a child it was hard to understand that

 
 

‘ heaven was metaphorical. I believed that heaven

was up in the sky somewhere, and that America
was heaven. I remember how I looked into the

sky before I boarded the plane, thinking that I_

would be making a home for myself in one of
those clouds very soon

I remember the-brown sandals I had on for
two reasons. One, because I watched my feet as I
mounted the steps to board the plane, and also
because I remember how inadequately they pro-
tected me from my ﬁrst snowfall as I dismounted

' the plane at John F. Kennedy Airport in the

The joury of a lifetime

United States of America.

I remember my sister whisking me away in

her brand new car for my ﬁrst shopping excursion
at the Willow Grove Mall in Bucks County, Pa. I
recall how she looked like an alien to me; she’d

» left home when I was aboutia  old and I’d
only seen her a few’ times since  Another rea- g
son she appeared dilferent was  ‘she radi- .-

.-if

ated an all-consuming energy ——. she seemed

‘ Americanized Over the years, however, I havei

realizedthat my sister is just extremely hyper.

After my ﬁrst shopping trip I remember feel- 4

ing like the best dressed 8 year-old in the world,
but after my ﬁrst day of school I remember feel-
ing like nothing. It was hard trying to adjust to a

new environment, but it was even

WEECHY A . harder ‘trying to ﬁt in with people

your age who are intent on making
you miserable.

I remember my so-called peers
making fun of everything ﬁom my accent to my
name. I also remember my mom telling me every '

day to keep my head up. There were times when r

I did not want to go to school at all, but my par-

ents had always taught me not to let anyone break A

my spirit or my stride. It was so funny, how when
I was in Nigeria, America seemed like heaven,
but at times back then it seemed more like hell.

I recall how my sisters and my mom banded
together to make America feel like home for me.
I remember how in the ﬁfth grade, two years after
I got here, Ireally started making ﬁiends and one
of those friends gave me the nickname that I still
go by, Weechy. America was by no means heav-
en, but it wasn’t hell either. It was and is just a

place where you have to work for everything, g

even happiness.

The aspect of my journey that I remember
best of all, though, is the scent. America smelled
like JFKAirport, like W1llow.Grove Mall, like a
brand-new car with a leather interior, but most of
all, like snowﬂakes on the coldest day of winter.
Ultimately, I believe that that is why my sense of
smell is heightened I was introduced — not
when I was born, but when I could appreciate it
—— to the scent of America. '

Weechy Ibeh will remember this journey forever‘

In a bold move normally reserved for
neighborhood garage bands and lounge singers
at your local Howard Johnson, Rage
Against the Machine has dedicated
an entire album to the fine art of
covering other people’s
music. Unlike those garage
bands and lounge singers,
though, Rage has successfully
mastered the art.

Understandably, Rage would
do a wide variety of songs because their music
is so eclectic. However, some of these songs
are‘ so unexpected that you have to double-
check your CD player hasn’t pulled a fast one
on you.

Take, for example, the cover of Devo’s

  
   
 

“ B e a u t i f u 1
World” — we
have come to
expect the pri-
mal scream of
Rage’s newly
departed front
man, Zach De
La Rocha, the
1-2 knockout
combo of Tim
Commerford’s
bass and. Brad
Wilk’s drums,
and the squeal-
ing manipula-
tions of Tom
Morrelo’s gui-
tar. Instead,’ we
hear singsong
w hi s p e ri n g
from De La
Rocha, accom-
panied only by
Morrelo’s play-
ing of quiet,
simple chords.
This is the one
and only exam-
ple of under-
stated Rage that you may ever find.

Rage plays their more recognizable style
on tracts such as Eric B. and Rakim’s
“Microphone Fiend,” Volume lO’s “Pistol Grip

Pump,” MC5’s “Kick Out the Jams” and

Cypress Hill’s “How I Could Just Kill a Man.”
They also perform a blistering punk rock ver-
sion of Minor Threat’s_ “In My Eyes.”

After a long wait, they also included “The
Ghost of Tom Joad,” a song originally written
and performed by Bruce Springsteen. Rage has
performed the song many times in concert, and
released it on their home video and a benefit
album, but now everyone can enjoy it on
Renegade.

The album’s other big surprises are covers
of “Street Fighting Man “and ‘‘Maggie’s

Farm,” by the Rolling Stones and
Bob Dylan, respectfully.
They are two covers that
you’d never expect to
hear on a Rage album,
. but they are done as
well, if not better than,
all the others.

Imitation is the sincer-
est form of ﬂattery and Rage most definitely
ﬂatters all of the artists they cover on this
album. And with constant rumors of Rage
Against the Machine being broken up, reunit-
ing, and then breaking up again, this could very
well be one of their last albums.

Corporate Holiday

From internships to work—study
to more illustrious non-school
related positions, I think it’s
fair to estimate that more
than half of Pitt students
hold down some sort of job or
another during the semester. Most
students will probably have
formed relationships with
their co—workers and will
invariably ﬁnd the oppor-
tunity to engage in a holi-
day celebration in the next
few weeks.
Whether it’s a
fancy catered affair or a
less formal get-together at a local watering hole, holiday
ofﬁce parties are an age—old tradition. They’ve been written
about extensively throughout the ‘years (Charles Dickens
created a rip-roaring, 19th-century version in “A Christmas
Carol”) and made appearances in umpteen movies and TV
shows (how many times is that old gag where you photo-
copy your butt going to be used?).

One of the best things about ofﬁce holiday parties is
that they’re usually not during work hours. Whereas a co-
worker’s birthday might be celebrated brieﬂy on company
time, a holiday party is at night, which means that you have
ample time to shower, shave, primp and pick out a fashion-
able outﬁt, ﬁnally showing that cute boy or girl from the
next cube or that attractive new server on your shift just
how hot you are after hours. They don’t know that you usu-
ally shimmy into a comfy pair of sweats and curl up on the
couch, exhausted, every other day after work — all they see

. is trampy glam.

A close second to being able to wow your office mates
with the lowest cut shirt you own or your best cologne is all
the free food at the party. College students aren’t usually
privileged enough to eat hors d’oeuvres on a regular basis,
so the finger food that your company offers is a real treat.

I usually load up on the cubed cheese selection, forgo-
ing crackers, which I can afford to eat anytime, and instead
concentrate on saving a tree by reusing my toothpick as
many times as possible. The sliced pepperoni is another
staple of the holiday party, as is french onion dip. And
remember, you take a chip, you dip once, and you don’t dip
again.

Lastly, for those of you who are over 21, holiday ofﬁce
parties provide an incredible amount of ammunition to save
for the ensuing year. Where else will natural working ene-
mies come together noisily in supply closet coitus, or dis-
robe multiple times while standing and singing AC/DC
songs on the conference or break room table that, only
hours before, was witness to a heart-breaking holiday lay-
off?

Wherever the location, whatever you wear, take this
soiree seriously. It might be the best time you’ve had in
weeks, or it might just be the first leg in a long Friday night
journey. No matter what, though, it will be the only time
your boss could possibly do “the worm.”
