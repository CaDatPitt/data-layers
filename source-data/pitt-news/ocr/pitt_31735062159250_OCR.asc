News Wins
Top Press
Rating

The 1948-49 News has added an
'All—American’ editorial rating to
the trophy and cash prize it receiv-
ed last spring ‘for management ex-
cellence. 0

Notification came Friday that the
Pitt paper drew a top rating for the
content and appearance of its news,
SP01‘ts, and editorial pages during .
the spring semester last year.

The evaluation was made by As-
sociated Collegiate Press in its
forty-first critical service for col-
lege newspapers. In the survey, the
only one of its kind made in the
field: 235 C0llege papers were stud-
ied and rated. '

Along with nine other papers
published by colleges and univer-
sities with enrollments above 5000
and coming out less often than dai-
ly, the News earned the highest
possible ranking.

Accompanying the rating wasthe
judge’s scorebook, from which the
rating was determined. It deals spe-

that make up the survey. The man-
ual will be used to guide this year's

detected by the experts.

As far as could be immediately
determined, the all-American rating
of last spring’s News marked the
first time the University Publica-
tion received such a high ranking.

Last year’s editor Don McCor-
mack, is now working in the United
Press bureau in Baltimore.

In May, the business staff was
informed that a cup, now in the
News’ possession, and a $150
check was due the News for its
first prize award in .‘general man-
agement.’

This competition, also covering
most of the nation's college papers,
was conducted by the National Ad-
vertising Service, one Ofjhe Agar!‘
cies handling national advertising.

In previous years the News has
received a first class rating from
Associated Collegiate Press.

Chest Drive
Dates Listed

Dates have been set for collec-
tions in the Pitt Chest Fund Drive.

At Ellsworth Center, contributions
will be taken on Tuesday, Nov. 1.
In the Cathedral, they will be ac-
cepted on Wednesday, Nov. 2.

The Chest Fund proceeds are
distributed among almost 100 sepa-
rate benefit organizations, many of
which are services for students
both American and foreign. Collec-
tion campaigns for these units have
been organized at Pitt into one fund
drive to eliminate the almost con-
stant hand-out requests students
experienced in previous years.

This drive will include eight
major agencies, with the Community
Chest as the main beneficiary, being
made up of 92 smaller agencies.

Other principal organizations are
the Mens’ Loan Fund, the Womens’
Loan Fund, the World Student Ser-
vice Fund, the Red Cross, the
March of Dimes, CARE, and the
United Negro College Fund.

First things on the agenda today
are a plug and a complaint..The

. plug is for the diabetes detection

drive being conducted by Drs.H. C.
Carlson and A. M‘. Jamison. It will
benefit every student to take advan-
tage of the facilities of the health

Of course the complaint is Tuck

these parts concerningvthis ques-
tion, we, as General Grant once
did, propose to fight it out along
this line if it takes all winter (and
it probably will.)

After all when you can‘ dump two
large pieces of ice in the stuff, and
still get the familiar bad taste,
something’s wrong. ,

The theory has been advanced.
by some defending factions that it
is necessary for the Misses Cramb-
let and Skeiwis to charge eight cents
for java in order to make ends meet.
In the first place ‘if the Shops
can’t make out by peddling their
one-slice-of meat (cheese), two-
pieces-of-bread sandwiches ’ for

I ‘ 15 cents, they’ll always be in the

red,In the second place, the coffee
is not worth the price.

You can’t believe what you read
in the time schedule of classes.
This statement is qualified by an
that happened last week.
History 133 was listed as "History
of the United States in the Middle
Period.”_ The presiding prof natur-
ally directed his opening remarks
in that direction. A bibliography,
outside reading, and a general re-
view were presented to the class.
A At the second meeting of the
class an embarassed professor
sadly announced, “There's been a

mistake.” _ _
It seems that History 13?; 1S

“Economic and, Social Topics of
the 19th Century.” 1

Another, class attracted notice
because its instructor didn’t show
up for the first two class periods.
Two economically-minded students,
figuring that it cost them 68 cents
everytime the teacher didn’t show
up, scampered up to the registrar’s
office. They found that the class
hour had been changed to a differ-
ent hour. Everyone had been noti-
fied--e-xcept the class members.

R. X. Graham, head of the Jour-
nalism department, takes a bus-
man’s holiday when he goes home.
He has a small printshop in the
basement of his house where he
works with the type faces he tells
his students about all day.

the fun.

The state and local police who
served in the latter capacity were
straight from behind the iron curtain.
They wouldn't even reveal the name
of the Pitt student whom they man-

With the recent high enrollments, most schools have experi-
enced a widening gap between students and faculty. As a result,

University students of the past few years have not benefited by
the close relationships with instructors that make for a fuller

campus life.

The ideal situation exists when
faculty and students have ample

facilities to meet between classes,
dine together, attend social and
and cultural events together, and
and take part in school politics
together.

Of course this goal is unattain-
able in very large schools like Pitt,
but _here and in other Universities,
the administrators to make an at-

tempt to provide as close a relation-
ship as possible.

For instance, a committee at the
University of Wisconsin came up
with a five-point plan. It suggests

the elimination of late afternoon
and night classes to allow more time
for cultural pursuits. It provides for
more dairy bars on the. campus and
faculty-student dinner clubs, and it
points out the need-for more student
membership on University commit-
tees plus a stimulation of political
activity. A ‘I

Considerable thought has been

given the problem here. Last April,

Audrey Westerman, a senior in the

College and chairman of the com-
mittee on student advisors, com-
pleted a report onthe advisory sys-
tem with some suggested changes.-vi
The main feature of Miss Wester-
man’s program was to furnish per-
manent advisors for students’ majors.
Each student so desiring would have
an advisor of hisiown choice in his

own department to help him fix a

curriculum and settle academic prob-
lems. r

A point that proved controversial
was freshmen advisors. Miss West-
erman would have every freshman

with an intended major assigned an

advisor in his department, and those

not decided on a major assigned as
general advisor.

Ihave been here for two years
and have managed to escape getting
parking tickets only because I have
parked a considerable distance
from the school.,However I got a
ticket recently and that is my gripe.

On the fatal day I was late ‘and
had no time to walk a mile or two.
I cruised through the Schenly Park
lot and became very disgusted at
the people who park on the sides
in such a way as to take up two
or three spaces. If the cops are so
anxious to pin a ticket on some-
body, why not these people? As it
was I had to, park illegally and
consequently’ it will cost me $10.

I wish someone would bring pres-

As Editor—in-Charge of Preserving University Traditiohs and

a few things to say about the protracted rail trip to the Pitt-Penn I

The deans were decidedly not in

. agreement. Dean of Men Theodore W.

Biddle came out strongly against
the freshmen plan. "It has never
been our policy to wet-nurse the
students,” he declared.

As Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the College, explains the policy,
the freshman year is too early ‘a
time for the student to benefit by a
regular advisor. "A student must be
here for some time before we know
what help heneeds,” he explained.

It would be easy to gain the im-
pression that freshmen are most in

-need of counseling because they

are youngest in the school and un-
aquainted with the mysteries of
choosing a curriculum. But, as Dean
Crawford points out, the College
bulletin and the Compass furnish

, adequate information and the entrant

ishelped by high school instructors
and upperclass counselors at Fresh-
man Camp. A

Another

consideration, D e a n

V Crawford said, is the fact that those

freshmen who have not chosen a
major usually express interest in
one of three general fields; Aviation,
Journalism, or Radio. A year of
college work is normally required
to indicate a wise choice of a maj-
or field within one of these groups.

Some of the Westerman report
suggestions were accepted however
and incorporated in. an expansion
of counseling‘ services. An addi-
tional room, 1828, will be utilized
and Mr. Benjamin Haseltine, instruc-
tor in modern languages, was added
to the counseling staff.

With these improvements, counsel-

ing will be offered down to the soph-‘I
’ omore_ level where, Dean Crawford

maintains, the first real need for it
exists.

First, a pat on the head of Dcn Ewart, Student Congress,mem-

Congress has pushed the deal
as far as they can, even making‘
tickets available at the Student
Desk, something which is not quite
in line with University policy.
From now on, the success of the
trip depends upon individual stu-
dent reaction to the low-cost deal.

‘So what?’ cracks the familiar
Tuck Shop oracle. ‘I can sit at
home with a bottle of beer and list-
en to Woody Wolfe. Maybe they’ll
even televise the game. I should

Pitt's football prospects are

looking up.»The makings of another
era of Pitt football power seem to
be at hand. The rebirth of the old ‘
student-alumni support that once
made every man, woman and child
in every corner of the land Pitt-con-A
scious could occur this year. ‘There
was a day when Pitt teams were
noted for the train of rooters that
followed in their wake, from the
Carnegie Tech mudflatsfto the Cali-
fornia Rose, Bowl. That was when
«a gold P meant Pitt all over the
country and the blue and gold
streamer was a pennant that Navy
purloined from Skyscraper U. That
day could return, and the Pitt-Penn
trip could bring it back this year.

The opportunity for a gigantic ,
migration of Pittsburghers to Phila-
delphiails the first in many a year.
If better than 300 Pitt fans can’t
whip up quite a powder-keg of en-
thusiasm on the long trip to Philly,
then times have really changed.
With that large a group of people
jamming downtown to board the.
train, Pittsburgh may realize that
Pitt has something more than a
building campaign this year. And
spontaneous rallies have a habit of
turning out'louder and better than

the contest, the outcome would have
been much different.

.The Mountaineers had everything

from pint—sized boy scouts to gar-
gantuan state police ranked around
the uprights to stave off any attempt
by Pitt men to lower the goalpost.
J That the defense was effective
was demonstrated by the only two
rabid attempts to get to the white
wood. One was made by a foolhardy
redhead who was set upon by rugged
looking freshmen wearing blue and
gold dinks and the same color knit
ties. He was'overcome by force of
numbers and finally retreated.

The other souvenir-seeker fared
even worse. He made the mistake
of turning on a huge state cop who
was trying to discourage his attack.
This luckless student was grabbed
from behind by another state police-
man, while the .other gave him a
thorough going-over with a billy
club. He suffered a long gash on
the side of the face and was taken
away by the law, despite the cries
of “Turn him loose” from spec-
tators.

The attack petered out soon after
this and about 30 minutes after the
game, the field was commanded by
West Virginia frosh who were chair-
ing an old gent, brandishing an axe,‘
up the field. i

There were some pleasant aspects
to the welcome. One was the noble
gesture of the Mountaineer band to-
wards the Pitt marchers. After the
halftime program the West Virginia
boys brought in cokes for all the
Pitt band members. Another was
West Virginians’ fine rendition of
“Hail to Pitt.” ‘

Something nice to see was the
flag raising ceremony performed by
Pitt ROTC‘ men and a coed dressed
in'a gold and blue outfit. The Mor-
gantown natives were very hospit-
able and even watched cars parked
illegally (including this reporter’s)
so they wouldn’r be towed, away.

Eagles Stop
Cedars By

24-6 Score

The high-spirited YMCA Eagles
walloped the favored Cedars, 24-6,
in an independent grid game on Fri-
day. The Cedars are the Remnants
of the Locals, last year’s indepen-
dent campus champs.

Both teams showed unimpress-
ively in the first half. It was a
rowdy battle between linesmen to
see who could push. the other the
the hardest. The first score came,
however, when Paul Tursak, Eagle
captain, threw a fluky 20-yard pass
to Ed Kissick. .

In the second half it was the
Eagles all the way. With the-con-
sistent throwing of Kissick and the
skillful catching of Ken Stevenson,
the Eagles tallied two more touch-
downs.

Both teams continually threatened
each other’s goal line in the third
quarter. Payditd finally came for
the Cedars when Macshanic, a
Cedar end, intercepted a pass and
raced ten yards for a TD.

Immediately after receiving the
following‘ kickoff, the Eagles mar-
ched down the field for their last
tally.

Bears Crush Giants

The YMCA Bears showed a pow-
erhouse Friday by trouncing the
Giants, 25-7. However, every score‘
made by the victors was by virtue of
a pass thrown by Lesko, a star back.

The Giants got their lone tally of
the game when Willis scooped in a
pass on the Bear ten-yard line and
scooted into the end 2006-

Pi Lams Take Eps

Pi Lam won its second game Fri-
day, 13-0, over outclassed Sigma
Phi Epsilon. Murray Cohen ran 13
yards in the third quarter to DI’€aK
a scoreless tie, and Eddie Langue
added another TD in the final period
on a 20-yard pass. Langue took
another pass for the extra point.

The first half saw lots of action
but no scoring. Both teams moved
for plenty of yardage in vain efforts
to tally.

PiKA , Kaps Tie

Two evenly matched teams, PiKA
and Phi Kappa, marched up and
down a sloppy field for 40 minutes
on Friday, but neither could cross
the goal line.

With 40 seconds remaining, the
PiKA’s almost scored on a pass,
but the intended receiver slipped in
a puddle just as he met the ball.
PiKA had slightly the better of it in
rushing and passing, using the man-
in-rnotion _effectively.

two seasons as a utility infielder
with John McGraw’s Giants.

Rough Battle Carried On
By Surprising Mounties

By DAVE

POLLOCK

Miami University of Ohio comes to town on Saturday for what
appears as a welcome breather to the Panthers after their rugged
20-7 conquest of West Virginia last weekend.

Long a power in small college circles, the Miami Redskins

have had a rough time of it this
year. Coach Woody Hayes’ proteges
have dropped two out of three en-
counters.

Facing entirely minor league
competition, last year's Mid-Amer-
ican champs opened with a 23-6
victory over Wichita, then lost to
Virginia, 21-18, and Xavier, 27-19.

Use Modified-T

The Tribe operates out of a modi- 5

fied-T and is guided by Mel Olix,
one of the best passing T-quarter-
backs in the Midwest.

Saturday’s clash at Morgantown
was played under a boiling 82 de-
gree sun that turned the Mountaineer
bowl into a giant sweat box. And
the Mounties who were just about
as torrid as the weather gave the
Panthers their ‘toughest game of
the year.

Jimmy Walthall’s pass to Bernie
Huntz that covered 17 yards, and

Gene Simmons’ perfect dropkick
put the Mountaineers ahead at the
half, 7-O.

Panthers Go Ahead

But Pitt got that back in less
than three minutes after the start
of the second half on Bimbo Cec-
cone’s 19-yard run and Nick Bol-
kovac’s placement. Then late in
the third period Cecconi put the
Panthers in front to stay on a 26-
yard run. Bolkovac missed his at-
tempt for the extra-point.

With West _ Virginia melting fast
in the heat, Lindy Lauro scored
the final TD on a six yard run in
the final minute of play.

_ Cecconi Brilliant

If Captain Lou Cecconi should
encounter any trouble earning a
living when he's finished school,
the little fellow ought to take up
dancing.

While having the best day of his
career against West Virginia on
Saturday, the "Dandy Bantam” from
Donora waved more legs and hips

at the Mounties than a strip teaser_

Cecconi’s runs of 19 and 26 yards
were beauties. The first came on a
fake pass and the second on a re-
verse from Robinson. Both times
he seemed trapped in the West Vir-
ginia secondary, but in that amaz-
ing way of his, he skittered through
and over diving tacklers and sprin-
ted into the end zone.

Besides his running, Bimbo was.

all over the field on defense. He
stalled one Mountaineer drive by
intercepting a pass on his own 3-
yard line and made a number of
tackles fromihis safety position.

Takes Beating

It wasn't all pleasant for Cecconi
though. A marked man, the Pitt
back took an unmerciful beating
from the upset-minded Mounties.

At every possible chance, the
Mountaineers piled on‘Bimbo. Which
caused one sideline observer to
remark, "The Mounties must belong
to a Pyramid Club the way they
stack-up on that Cecconi.”

SIDELINES:

When the Panthers got the ball
late in the game, a photographer
covering the game said to another
photographer, “Pitt is freezing the
ball.’’

G True enough, but while they were
freezing the ball the Pitts marched
55-yards for the final TD that sewed
up the game-a nice way to freeze
the ball.

  he Not-So-llull

Dudley Deﬁroot

By DIYRON KOPELNAN
Sports Editor

‘Probably the lesson taught by Saturday’s scare at West Virginia was
that trouble should always be expected when the enemies are thinkers.

Dudley DeGroot and Jim Walthall are

most certainly thinkers.

Last year the Mountaineers brought a T-formation team to Pittsburgh

with their game built solely around
Quarterback Walthall’s passing.
Pitt, knowing this full well, rushed
Walthall off his feet and copped an
easy win.

After the game most‘ of the West
"Virginia players sat around their
dressing room moping as beaten
players will do. But not so with
Waltnall and DeGroot.

The long-jawed coach and his
skinny, buck-toothed field general

. immediatelyr adjourned to a corner

where they were seen talking fev-
erishly and picking the game apart
from start to ﬁnish. Maybe they were
‘planning’ their next meeting with
Pitt.

At any rate, between then and
last‘ Saturday the West Virginia
thinkers saw to it that Pitt would
not have their methods down pat in
this latest game. DeGroot thought
up almost every outlandish and un-
expected tactic in the book. And
Walthall mixed the plays with just
the proper insanity.

Look at what the Panthers had to
unscramble.

The T, the single wing, the
winged T, the seven man defensive
line, the eight man line, the man in
imotion, the flanker, the quick kick,
the on-sides kick, the faked field
goal, and probably a dozen other
tricks which went undetected in

DeGroot’s multi-ringed circus.
Perhaps the Mountaineers did not
win the ball game, but they sure
made losing a mighty interesting
activity.
A Leader With Poise
Prior to the Pitt game, Morgan-

town citizens were saying that Walt-

hall had lost his touch. “He can’t.
hit his receivers any more,” said a
Morgantown writer shortly before the
kickoff.

Walthall, of course, went out to
prove that players with poise don't
stay in the slumps long. He has
plenty of that stuff, I know.

Last spring Pitt’s baseball team
was playing West Virginia at the
Schenley Oval. Walthall started at
second base for the_Mountaineers
but bobbled so many chances thathe
was yanked in the fifth inning.

During the late innings a couple
of spectators were loafing behind
the visitors’ bench. "Boy, that
Walthall really smelled second base
up,” one of them remarked to the
other. No sooner did the words come
out of his mouth than he looked‘
down and saw that Walthall was sit-
ting in front of"him.

The lanky West Virginian. said not
a word. Nor did he turn his head so
much as an inch. Two cents is about
what yours truly felt like.

Hellcats Skin
JayVees 12-0

The Memphis Hellcats copped

.their second victory of the 1949

season Saturday at the expense of
the Pitt Jayvees, 12-0. A power-'
ground attack, coupled with
sharp passing, put the sailors on
the long end of the score.

The southern invaders tallied
twice in the first period and once
in the fourth to attain the shutout
victory. In the first quarter, a bad
pass from. center sent both teams
screaming into the end zone after
the ball, and the young Panthers
Q—0. Following
the kick, Memphis drove to the
Pitt. 11. From there Striedel booted

a field goal and Memphis led, 5-0.

In the fourth period Butler inter-
cepted a Jones pass on the Pitt

7'44-yard line. From there the Hell-

cats moved to a touchdown in eight

' plays. Hayth climaxed the drive by

turning his left end 13 yards to pay-
dirt.

Back Steve Pavlakovic came off
the bench to lead the Panthers in
their losing cause.

THE DU PON T

DIGEST

 

  Research across the U. S. A.

YOUNG SCIENTISTS, ARE BUILDING
CAREERS WITH DU PONT FROM
CONNECTICUT T0 TEXAS

lWhen you think of Du Pontresearch,
‘you may think ﬁrst of Wilmington,
Delaware. Actually, only eight of the
Company’s 36 research groups are
located there. Du Pont scientists now
pursue their studies in 11 states scat-
tered from Connecticut to Texas.
Each of these laboratories is a self-
contained operation. It may be de-
voted in part to fundamental re-
search and applied research, or to
investigations looking to the devel-
opment of new products-sometimes
a combination of these activities.

An unusual Du Pont laboratory
is one opened’ last year at Newburgh,
New York.

Inside the Laboratory

In the three-story building at New-
burgh, scientists have at their ‘dis-

posal the most modern equipment’

for study of coated fabrics and plas-
tic sheetings under all sorts of con-
ditions. For example, a new product
can be tested in a ,room maintained

 
 

Newest DuPont laboratory, at Newbu

at a temperature of -20° F. In other
rooms, the effects of high tempera-
ture and humidity can be studied.
Equipment is available for testing
tensile strength, tear resistance, fad-
ing, ﬂex ~and ﬂame resistance, and
many other characteristics. One of

Du Pont’s 33 libraries has quarters.

in the building; there is a photo-
graphic darkroom, as well as offices,
conference and work rooms.

The Newburgh Laboratory works
closely with the adjacent p1ant,which
makes “Fabrikoid” pyroxylin coated
fabrics, ‘ ‘Fabrilite’ ’ vinyl resin coated
fabrics and plastic sheetings, “Ton-
tine” washable window shade cloth,
bookbinding materials, and other
coated and impregnated fabrics and
plastic sheetings for many uses.

‘Research of Du Pont

Research has long been a major ac-
tivity at Du Pont, and it ﬂourishes
in an atmosphere of appreciation,
encouragement and patience. The

new products, the new plants, and’
the new and better jobs of the years

tocome will develop from the pains-
taking research programs being car-
ried on today in the laboratories.

  

rgh, N. Y., was opened last year. t is devoted to research and
deyelopment work in the ﬁeld of coated and impregnated fabrics and allied products.

 

 

H. A. Van Ellen, B. S. Ch., Colgate ’42, and
E. R. Grisé, M. S. Ch., Worcester Polytechnic
Institute ’48, investigating the properties of
vinyl compounds used in plastic-coated fabrics.

 

K. F. Richards, B. S. Ch. E., Cornell ’48, and
E. K. Holden, M. S. Ch. 15., Delaware ’48,
studying “Teflon” tetraﬂuoroethylene resin
insulating material with special apparatus at
the Newburgh Laboratory.

Choice‘ of Careers

Each of the Du Pont manufacturing
departments conducts continuous
research. They operate much like
separate companies, with interests
ranging from heavy chemicals to
plastics and textile ﬁbers. Each holds
challenging opportunities for college-
trained chemists and physicists, as

’ well as chemical, civil, electrical, in-

dustrial and mechanical engineers,
also those specializing in production,
sales and many other ﬁelds.

In this alert, ever—growing organi-
zation, young graduates can choose
from a variety of careers the one
that suits them best as their ability
and interests develop.

Publicists Prowl For Pantherette

Disguised behind black beards,
a cage hidden beneath flowing Sher-
lock Holmes’ robes, the Panther
Prowl committee members today
were searching for their Pantherette.

Jack Schano, chairman of the
sophomore dance, said the "vicious”
animal, which was to be given away
as the door prize at the Oct. 14
dance, escaped “after ripping out
the bars of its cage” sometime Fri-
day afternoon.

The Panther Prowl will be held
at West View Park with Lee Kelton
and his orchestra playing from nine
one.

Tickets for the informal prancing
may be obtained from the Student
Desk, PIA, and frat representatives
here and at Ellsworth Center, in
room 103 and from‘Student Congress
members.

The tickets sell for $3.25 now,
_but the price will be raised one—half
dollar at the door.

The Panther committee
