Beth Dudley loved her job.

As an office administrator, ‘Dudley
—who passed away Friday atthe age of
40 — did the littlethingsthattoo often
get taken for granted.

“She didn’t have a1otoffainily,” Pitt

Bond, who worked with Dudley in
Pitt’s Disability Resources and Services
office, received a text message Friday
from a friend asking if she knew why
Dudley didn’t show up for work.

V “She wouldn’t just not show up. It
was really strange,” Bond said.

Prof. tells of Haitian orphans

The air in,Haiti was hard to breath,
thick with the dust surrounding air-
planes had swept off the ground and
into people’s eyes. . ‘'
Edward Sites, a professor in Pitt’s
School of Social Work, was growing
weary. He had not eaten or slept since
departingfrom Pittsburgh hours ago.
His energy faded as he unloaded and
arranged medical supplies for nearly
ﬁve hours. He was waiting for politi-
cians to convince the Haitian govern-

an invitation to the Big Ten con-
ference — at least not this week.
The news came as stories surfaced

I t doesn’t look like Pittwill accept

V online this past weekend that a

meeting between Pitt athletes and
athletic director Steve Pederson last
Wednesday focused on Pitt’s decision

‘ to join the BigTen.

But Pitfs associate athletic direc-

“Any internet reports that suggest
Pitt is planningto make an announce-
ment on its conference member-
ship this week,” Borghetti said, “are
untrue.” ,

The statement comes after mul-
tiple blogs and online news organiza-
tions speculated on the exact words
said in the meeting between players
and Pederson.

Stories said that Pitt athletes
'I‘weeted — and then later deleted
messages — about a possible switch

from the Big East to the BigTen.

Some athletes who attended
the meeting said that although they
expected the meeting to involve talk
about Pitt’s ﬁitiire conference affili-
ation, Pederson mostly talked about
Pitt athletics’ recent success and
reminded the players to stay focused
mentally in classes this semester.

The Big Ten conference, which
includes 11 schools, aimounced Dec.
15 that the league’s commissioner
was asked to “provide recommenda-
tions for [expansion] by the [Big Ten
Council of Presidents/Chancellors]
over the next 12 to 18 mon .”

news organizations into an irnmedi—

an invitation. Pittwas among schools

ence expanded was in 1990, when

Residence halls, offices receive Haiti buckets

Volunteers 4 2

= dent ﬁmdraisers from churches and

community organizations that have
donated to the Red Cross.

On campus, the University’s “Buck-
etBrigade for Haiti” could exceed the
initial expectations of 1,000 buckets,

_ Steve Zupcic said. Zupcic works in
A Pitt’s Community Relations Office and

helped organize the fundraiser.

The Bucket Brigade beneﬁts the
Brother’s Brother Foundation, which
Dr. Robert Andrew Hingson, a pro-
fessor in Pitt’s School of Medicine,
founded in 1958. The University and

Brother’s‘Brotherworkedtogetherto .

organize an aid package for people liv-
ing in temporary housing in Haiti.

“When we heard the extent of
the damage, we said, ‘We’ve got to
do something,”’ Zupcic said.

The supplies from Pitt won’t ar-
rive until morethanamonth afterthe
quake, which isn’t ideal, Zupcic said,
but it takes time when organizations
ask people for speciﬁc donations.

The ﬁrst wave of 500 buckets
went to residence halls and the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, Zupcic said. The next
set of buckets went to ofﬁces around
campus.

The Department of Parking,

Transportation and Service’s Cen-
tral Receiving Ofﬁce started to col-
lect some of the buckets yesterday.
Zupcic said more than 30 ofﬁces on
campus, includinghis own, have ﬁlled
buckets and some have started to use
cardboard boxes to collect supplies.
Those oﬂices called Zupcic to ask for
“Bucket Brigade for Haiti” labels to
put on the boxes. '

On Monday, the receiving ofﬁce
will collect the buckets, attach the
lids and deliverthem to Brother’s
Brother. - . V .

Pitt might have to buy more buck-
ets to ﬁt-all of the items now sittingin
cardboard boxes, Zupcic said, adding
that all of the buckets should arrive at
the foundation by Feb. 12 or 13.

Luke Hingson, president of the
Brother’s Brother Foundation and
the founder’s son, said the buckets
will likely arrive in Haiti two weeks
after the foundation receives them,
if not sooner.

Some groups on campus have rim
into a different situation. '

At a tabling event Friday in Tow- '

ers lobby, the Caribbean and Latin
American Student Association re-
ceived a few monetary donations

but no toiletries, its vice president,
Alyssajames, said. The association
tabled a few times in the lobby for
two-hour periods, raising about $10
each time. —

 

We’ve got to do
something.

Steve Zupcic

‘ “There have been people who
come to the table and donate, but
many don’t make eye contact and
walk away,”James said. The student
response “could be better,” she said.

The association plans for a movie
night and other activities in the com-
ing weeks,_]ames said.

She said the association planned
to workwith another outside charity,
FLM-Haiti, with which the group had

previously worked. Last November,‘

the association ran a ﬁmdraiser to
help support FLM—Haiti.

FLM-Haiti was founded in 1983
and works through Pittsburgh to fund
education initiatives in Haiti. Its main
center, 20 miles southeast of Port—au-
Prince was not severely damaged by
the quake, executive director Leon
Pamphile said.

The people of Haiti “hadasense of
hope for the future” when he visited
last October, Pamphile said. Before
the earthquake hit, FLM-Haiti had
focused on expanding its services
to provide better education to more

_ people in Haiti.

The magnitude 7 quake left FLM-

- Haiti’s facilities southeast of the capi-

tal largely intact, Pamphile said.

Many people, though, have leftthe
city to seek shelter in the surround-
ing areas.

“Many people leaving Port—au—
Prince will need help, and we want
to be in the position to do it,” Pam-
phile said. _ ‘

FLM-Haiti altered its day-to-day
plan from education to a “crisis mode”
of providing aid to those affected by
the quake, Pamphile said.

“It took a few seconds for ev-

erything to collapse, and it will take
months or years to rebuild. The com-
mitments ﬁ'om the community will
hopefully be longstanding,” Pamphile
said. .

Brother’s Brother ran into the
same problems thatthe Red Cross has
—— the earthquake damaged the port
at Port-au-Prince too much to allow
shipments of aid, Hingson said.-

Haiti has a number of smaller
ports that allow ships to arrive,
Hingson said. The foundation sent
a 40-foot shipping container to one
last week.

Other shipments can go through
the Dominican Republic, which shares
the eastern half of the island of His-
paniola and was largely undamaged
by the quake.

Air transport remains the main
method of shipping aid to the dev-
astated nation. The American Red
Cross sent56 ﬂightswith aid supplies,
toiletries and medical equipment,
Knavish said.

“People wonder about how much

H has not been done, but they don’t look

at what happened there. The extent
of the damage is beyond what we can
comprehend,” he said.

Pitt professor brings orphans to ,United States

Sites 4 1

ﬁrst large group ofHait1'an orphans to the United
States and causing controversy in the process.

He and his team members intendedto bring
54Haitian orphans to the United States, butwhen
they landedinPort—au—Prince, Haiti’s capital, they
ran into a slew of obstacles.

To begin with, they were exhausted.

Their trip had been in the works for several
days — since shortly after the 7.0 magnitude
quake shook the impoverished country. Sites’

' role inthe mission, astheycalled it, beganwitha

phone callfrom Dr. Mary Carrasco, the director of
A Child’s Place at Mercy, aprogram in Pittsburglfs
Mercy Health System. The group provides care
to abused or neglected children. Carrasco asked
Sites, who has a background in child welfare, to

accompany her to Haiti to make sure the vol- .

unteers transported the orphans to the United
States legally. Sites immediately agreed.

At the time, the volunteers thought they
would take 150 children to the United States.
They prepared to take a plane that could hold
160 people. But then the Dutch and French gov-
ernments joined the rescue efforts. Only 54 of
the original 150 Haitian children still needed to

. leave the country. V

At 11 am. on Monday, January 18, Sites
boarded the Republic Airways plane that would
take him and 30 physicians, nurses, politicians
and other volunteers to Haiti. The volunteers
ﬁlled the empty seats to the ceilingwith medical
supplies. The flight’s crew members ‘unloaded
the plane’s spare tires to make room for more,
risking the possibility of technical difliculties.
The plane carried 4,000 tons of medical sup-
plieslto Haiti. ‘

Thevolunteersﬂewsevenhoursbefore some-
one told the pilot that the plane couldn’t land in
Haiti The pilottold officials that Gov. Ed Rendell
was on board, and the crew eventually received
permissiontotouch down. 4

. Landingin Haitiwas diflicult.
. , .‘.‘The cont1'oltowerswerel<nocl<edoutbythe
earthquake,” Sites said. “The pilotsihad‘ to use
light [ﬁom bonﬁre], wind and speed to calculate

* the_landing.”

Sites recalled that even the experienced pilot
of the Republic Airways plane considered it a
‘  1an .9’ A ‘ .
Reporters, Army personnel and many Hai-
‘ tians geetedthem on the runway, but Sites didn’t
see any ofthe54children. -

The Pittsburghteamquicklyleamedthatthe

V Haitian govemmentwasn’t granting seven of the’

children who did not have adoptiveparents inthe
United States permissiontoleave the country.Ali
andjamie McMutrie, the sisterswho ranthe Hai-
tian orphanage caringfor the children, refused
to leave Haiti without all 54 orphans.

As an experienced social worker, Sites ‘un-
derstood the Haitian govemment’s hesitance

- to grant the paperwork.

‘ ‘Human uaflicldng is a severe problem in
Haiti. The Haitian government worried that
perhaps the children in the McMutrie sisters’

orphanage had at one time been bought from
their families for a nominal fee and therefore

still had family somewhere in Haiti who could '

care for them.

“You have here what you might ‘call conflict-
ing interests,” Sites said. “On one hand, people
want to bring [the children] to a Safe place. On
the other hand these children are being ripped
out of their family and culture.”

The poliﬁciaps on the flight, including Rendell
and Rep.Jason Altmire (D —McCandless), irnme—

diately began making phone calls to attain the
' necessary paperwork for the seven children. ‘

Duringthistime, the Republic Airways plane
was forced to leave the tarmac. The plane’s one-
hour time limit to remain on the ground had
expired. Sites and the other passengers were
then stranded on the runway.

Alterﬁve hours of negotiations, duringwhich
Sites helped to unload and arrange the medical
supplies, the seven children received clearance
to leave the country. All 54 orphans and the Mc-
Mutries moved to thetarmac with a military
escort. * 1

Medical personnel lined the children up
at two tents and handed each one a lollipop to
cheer themup and distract them while doctors
examined them under the light from gas-pow-

ered lamps and bonﬁres._Sites helped with the I

examinations and changed several children’s

diapers. _ -
Next, the volunteers and the orphans boarded

-a massive C-17 Air Force cargo plane and pre-

pared to head back'to Pittsburgh. However, aﬁnal
headcount of the children revealed one child,
2—year—old Emma,was missingjamie McMutrie
stayed behind until she could ﬁnd Emma and
returnwith her the next day. . -
‘ Children surrounded Sites during his flight.
Onhis lap he helda2-year-old childwho slept
the entire flight. Four children between7and 10
years old sat next to him on either side. These

‘- older children were “wideéeyed and interested‘ l

ineverything,”Sités said _

Havingnever exper'iencedaplane ride before,
some of the children on the flight were afraid
they would fall out of the sky. Translator Smana
Parnphile Clerfe assured the worried children
of their safety.  - . v .

During the ride, Sites and the other adults
kept the children occupied with Webkinz, cray-
ons and coloring books. Many of the children
had never seen crayons before.

“We were just substitute parents for the
night,” Sites said. _ s A

EDITORIAL

Let athletes be heard on conference shakeup

ver since Pitt and Penn State
E played their last football
game against each other in
2000, fans have been calling for

the rivalry game to be restored.
The two programs, which

faced off 96 times in 107 years,

had perhaps the biggest intrastate
rivalry in the nation. The result
was national prestige for both pro-
grams, which saw a combined 11
national championships during
that span.

Both schools have been rela-
tively hush on why they haven’t
agreed to revive the rivalry, but
there’s one dramatic solution that,

as of late, seems like a real pos-
sibility. .

What if Pitt joined the Big Ten
Conference?

Pitt officials have denied Inter-
net rumors that they’ve already
spoken with their athletes about
a switch (see related story, page
1), but even if a decision is yet to

‘be made, it’s no secret that the

Big Ten is seriously considering
adding another team and that
Pitt is one of the contenders for
an invite. A

A switch would mean Pitt foot-
ball would no longer play its Big
East rivals — such as West Vir-

ginia, Cincinnati and Syracuse —
and instead, regularly face Big Ten
teams, such as Penn State, Ohio
State and Michigan. If all sports
teams switched conferences,
Pitt’s basketball team would stop
playing schools like Connecticut,
Villanova and Georgetown, and
instead play schools like Michigan
State, Illinois and Indiana.
There are millions of dollars
involved in conference selection,
and most aspects of the deals are
kept private. Any deal with the
Big Ten doesn’t appear to be made
yet, which makes it even harder to
speculate on the ﬁnancial implica-

tions of a switch.

While ofﬁcials might focus on
the bottom line and fans might
focus on the biggest games, we’d
like to invite a new — and perhaps
the most important + party to the

‘discussion: the student-athletes.

Some-Pitt athletes Tweeted

about a potential conference ~

switch, but their comments were
later deleted.

Pitt ﬁelds 17 Division I teams,
and a switch would likely impact

"all of them. The ﬁnances and

the fandom will focus mainly on
football and basketball, but what
about the the players of the other

/'

15 teams? -
These teams exist for and be-

POINT-COUNTERPOINT

Clique clash: Who’s the bigger d—bag? A

Brociety not cool, bro

  

Dave Beitzel
Columnist

Throughout history, certain groups have
plagued cultures and communities, like
British imperialists or the Huns. Now, it
is the bros.

Bros snuck into our hearts on the coat-
tails of Mario and Luigi. Our guard was
down. Originally, bros provided us with
pipe—warping romps, but now we’re stuck
with popped—collar cretins screeching
Journey at the end of every party.

There is a stereotype for bros: SempleF-
est—hopping, upside-down-visor-wearing,
chinstrap-bearded, O.A.R.-listening frat
boys who only wear aviator sunglasses
when their apish brows fail to shade their
eyes. This profile is useful, but only as a
generalization.

Most fraternity brothers are not bros.
Many are fine folk. The Beastie Boys wore
aviators — granted it was ironically in
“Sabotage.”

Bros are thick-necked and sweaty —

yet, their danger is not in physical attri-‘

butes, but rather behavioral ones.
Unlike hipsters, bros are not always
identiﬁable, nor are they part of one large
social circle. Instead, they inﬁltrate many
circles, infesting even the most chaste

communities with their alpha—chauvin-
ism. - .

Bros are egotists so concerned with
their own image that they would get
weenis tucks if plastic surgery made them
available. ' . H

The bro essence exists outside of the
individual. It transcendsvboth nature and
nurture, lurking in the ether, waiting to be
awakened by ajager Bomb. Milwaukee’s
Best is equally efﬁcient.

Hipsters hip, but skin-deep

  

Erik Hinton
Managing Editor

Before I begin, let me come clean. Only 15
percent of my jeans are made for men. I D] a
monthly dance party at abar named after an

few weeks, and most of the artists in my iTunes

  
  
  
 
  
   
 
  
  
   

list David Byrne and Patsy Cline as inﬂuenc-
es. By all superﬁcial metrics
I would be grouped in
with those natter-
ing nabobs of
dilettantism:
hipsters.

Andy Warhol experiment. I'haven’t shaven in a c .

which hipsters can pour their short—term, "

fanatical interests. Consider early uses of the
term “hipster.” In 1948, the American cultural
magazine The Partisan Review wrote, “Car-
rying his language-and his new philosophy
like concealed weapons, the hipster set out
to conquer the world.” In 1959 jazz Scene
published, “J ive—talk or hipster-talk is  an
argot or cant designed to set the group apart
from outsiders.” T

Though the philosophy has changed — to-
day’s hipsters don’t spout novice existential-
ism but recite postmodern mantras —- and the
music has shifted from jazz to low-ﬁ, folkish
and electro stuff, the mindset remains the
same. Hipsters cherry pick some‘ niche and
adopt its jargon and accoutrements as their
lingua franca.

Picture the following scene from a party
thatl once attended. This is an actual con-
versation I heard: .

Dude in impossibly big glasses —— “So
what are your plans after college?”

Frumpy girl wearing all kinds of layered
jersey — “I don?t know. I’m just so tired of

all this fake work, work, work. I’m thinking
of moving to Portland and taking up glass-
blowing.” ' ‘c '

Dude — “That’s awesome. Getting to
touch your creation. None of this corporate
simulacra.” ,

Girl —— “Yeah. [Pause] Wanna go inside?

Bros only care about attention, alcohol  

Beitzel 4 6

in herd mentality. Unfunny things
are suddenly hilarious. Women
become meat. The Dave Mat-
thews Band becomes good.

At this stage, bros don’t call
each other bros anymore. They
are Broseidon, G.I. Bro and Bro-
sama  I mean, Brobama.

Other acceptable nomencla-

l ture includes broseph, broham,

brah and d*ckface. It’s a broci-
ety. ‘

Alcohol is not the only thing to
blame, though. It merely manipu-

lates and exaggerates emotions
already present. Bros need ca-
maraderie to protect themselves
from a world blithely indifferent
to their existence.

In the absence of high school’s
social stratiﬁcation, bros need

to feel important. As children of

suburban privilege, bros’ behav-
ior in high school was‘ classiﬁed
as common teenage antics. But
college is a different animal. Ev-
eryone’s a stranger, and there’s
less clout given to superﬁcial

groupings. Therefore, bros as-
sume a defensive posture: You are
either a bro or The Other.

Bros overcompensate for their
loneliness by narrowing their
friends and intensely focusing
on that small, select circle. Loy-
alty is as important to ‘bros as it
is to Don Corleone. Bros must

prioritize fellow bros, especially

with regard to hos;

That group gets loud at par-
ties. They desperately attract
attention to themselves in piti-

able attempts to regain that lost
importance. When this fails, true
bros become the Frosh-bane.
They assail freshmen, to create
and subjugate a lower caste than
their own.

This is what makes bros both
revolting and sympathetic. We
all get lonely or long to feel sig-
niﬁcant. Yet, many of us will not
ﬁnd unselﬁsh love for years, if
ever. Most of us will never be as
renowned as we would like.

But we must resist the urge to

become notorious. Turning into
a bro will not solve our dilem-
mas. It will only make us d**chier-
than hipsters, who at least are
fashionable and often funny, if
equally vain.

So beware thehaberdasheries
of Abercrombie 8: Fitch. Leavest
thou hair un—gelled and rebuke
the tunes of Sublime. Or ye may
yet become a bro.

Hipsters -don’t mean it when they say ‘love ’

I think my friend’s noise band is
playing-” . C

Now, glassblowing, the Paciﬁc
Northwest and noise are. all ﬁne in-
terests. However, in this particular
tableau of insincerity,,they are just

i ' neon ﬂags signaling that you are

part of the elite weird. The fatal ﬂaw
of hipsters — and this is what sets
them apart from people whose inter-
ests coincide with hipsters -— is that
they don’t actually care about the
things they say they love. They just
want to be card-carrying members

, of the secret society of card carriers.

The requirements for membership
are constantly changing and chasing
this caprice is their real pastime.
Sure,‘ bros are intojagermeister
and telling girls thatthey have awe-
some racks. But they are actually

into it. The growlers of Natty Ice
and center spreads of Adriana Lima
are the authentic stuffs of dreams,
whether or not they are bad dreams.
Look down on it if you want, but
I would take a bro repping Under
Armour every day over a hipster

promoting Goodwill yesterday,
American Apparel today and —
likely — something like Topshop
tomorrow. Sincerity is the deal
breaker in this one, Mr. Beitzel.

Set your blankets to stun—ning works of quilting

Patrick Wagner
Staﬁ” Wri ter
“Star Trek Quilts”
W1ldCard
4209 Butler Street
(412) 224-2651

Jan. 15 through Feb. 24

A new art exhibit in Lawrenceville
is boldly going where no quilt_has
gone before.

There’s little doubt that the origi-
nal Star Trek series had avast cultural
impact.From its serious social themes
to its whimsical cheesiness to William
Shatner’s Shakespearian delivery, the
showwas a marvel of everythingwon-
derful about the 1960s.

Today, Gene Roddenberry’s sci—ﬁ
staple pops up everywhere in Ameri-
can pop culture, including on one of
the most unlikely mediums — the
quilt. .
Elliot McNally’s “Star Trek Quilts”
exhibit at Lawrenceville’s WildCard
combines the two into a cultural jux-
taposition that’s just too jarring not
to be good. A

“They’re supposed to be tongue
and cheek,” she said. “They poke
good-natured fun at the handmade
sets in the original show itselfand also
at all the things that have followed in
the wake of this show that ran for no
time at all.” -

The exhibit consists of 16 quilts
that range from two inches all the way
to three feet and began while McNally
was still in college at the Savannah
College of Art and Design majoring
inﬁber arts. I

“I was in a quilting class, and I
made the ‘Transporter Room One’
for a project,” McNally said.

Coupled with avisual culture class
McNally took at the same time that

I made the
‘Transporter Room
One’ for a project.

Elliot McNally

included a discussion about the sym-
bolism of the original Star Trek, her
visionwasbom. .

“It was a ﬁmny medium playing
on everything that was already out
there,” she says. “I had never seen
a Star Trek quilt before,” McNally
said.

With that in mind, sheset out to
create a variety of quilts using meth-
ods and materials both native and
foreign to quilt making. '

“I was really interested in using
different pieces of fabric and I tried
not to use anything new, so I enjoyed
the snuggle of trying to make differ-
ent fabrics work.”

Appliqued cloth, iron—on sheets
and hand embroidery all helped her
to create her unique vision of the
original “Star Trek” series while still
keeping the humor of these images
intact.

This idea, however, didn’t just
come out of thin air, even in that vi-
sual culture class.

Itwas sparked by a serendipitous
discovery ata Goodwillstore, reignit-
ingapassionbrewingsince childhood.
A tape containing an early ’90s “Star
Trek” rerun marathon (complete with
vintage commercials) reintroduced

the sci-ﬁ series to the artist who had , '

previously stayed up late to watch the
spinoff, “Star Trek: The Next Genera—
tion” when she was younger.

With “Star Trek” once again
prominent in the media eye, McNally
credits its success to “wonderful char-
acters and the relation to the times,”
citingthe show’s propensityfor deal-
ingwith serious issues — such as the
civil rights movement — through
ﬁction.

Though the original series is long
gone, there’s still time to catch the
spirit of the original with “Star Trek
Quilts” inLawrenceville through Feb.
24.

The new buzz in the computer
industry is Apple’s unveiling of
the iPad. The iPad, described
by some as an “iPod Touch on
steroids,” and by others as an
Amazon Kindle look—alike, seems
to cause confusion in many peo-

ple.

Rightfully so. The iPad might
ultimately prove, if not marketed
correctly, to ﬁnd itself without an
audience in that constant com-
puter war between “niftiness”
and price point.

Many readers may be wonder-
ing,’ “What the hell is an iPad?”
Put simply, the_iPad is a small
tablet computer device similar
in shape to those Amazon Kindle
devices you sometimes see people
using on airplanes.

A It features an operating sys-
tem that appears to be a scaled-

    
  
  
   
   
  
   
 

PlTTS

up version of the iPhone operat-
ing system.

The device allows you to surf
the web, View e—mail, play mu-
sic and get around using Google
Maps. ‘

Apple’s website boasts that the
iPad comes loaded with Safari for
web browsing, iTunes for music,
an application called iBook for
reading electronic books, Apple’s
iPad Mail application, a photo-
viewing tool, a notebook utility
for meetings and Apple’s address
book application for keeping
track of contacts.

The designers made sure to
incorporate the best of Apple’s
human interaction technology,
giving users the ability to use
Apple’s “gestures” on its 9.7-inch
screen to manipulate photos, surf
the Internet, and edit notes in the
notebook. It weighs 1.5 pounds
and, according to Apple, can get
up to 10 hours of battery life per
charge.

For those who want to pay for
wireless service, the iPad will be
available with 3G communica-
tions for surﬁng and email when
a WiFi hotspot is nowhere to be
found. ‘

The iPad utilizes a touch-
screen keyboard, similar to the
one used on the iPhone and the
iPod Touch. A real-world key-

board can be added with the ad— ,

ditional purchase of a keyboard
dock.

Sounds interesting. The iPad
appears to be a nifty little device
with a lot of inventive engineer-
ing —— deﬁnitely something you’d
want to play around with in an
Apple store. i

The only problem I can iden-
tify with it is  who’s it for?

After playing with it at the
Apple store, are there really that
many people who will want to
take it home?

Pricy iPad not first

It remains uncertain whether the iPad is a rnatchfor the Kindle

port, will cost $499. Users who just want
an e-book reader will undoubtedly wish to
save the few hundred dollars and buy an
Amazon Kindle for $259. Sure it doesn’t
have a color screen, but how many novels
have color pictures?

People who want extreme portability
and want to consolidate their electronic
devices will buy the email-internet-tele-
phone-iPod device Applevalready has on
the market —- the iPhone. "

People who want the ﬂexibility and
power of a full-ﬂedged tablet PC might be
disappointed by the fact that the iPad only
has a touch—screen keyboard (without
additional purchase, that is) and doesn’t
run a full—blown version of OS X.

So, what is it? The closest Apple will
probably ever get to a netbook‘? You could
draw some parallels;

The iPad runs on Apple’s new A4

‘ processor, a small, comparatively slow

processor with an onboard graphics unit
capable of running all the pretty graph-
ics of Apple’s universe and then some.
Netbooks are commonly designed with
‘smaller processors to control costs and
extend battery life. ’

The iPad’s screen is within netbook
range at 9.7 inches. However, the iPad runs
the iPhone operating system, -whereas
netbooks, as a rule, run minimally modi-
ﬂed’ desktop operating systems.

The iPad will also cost no less than

 

 

MCT Campus

$499 4 a ratheristeepprice for the aver-
age netbook. Those who want a keyboard
that ﬂirts with standard size will have to
make an additional investment.

Despite the difference in price and the
fact that the iPad boasts a greater feature
set, some bloggers insist the iPad will butt
heads with the Kindle.-

The New York Times ran concurrent
articles describing the futureof the Kindle
once iPad is fully released. The two articles
together made six assessments: three indi-
cating the iPad would trounce the Kindle,
and three indicating the iPad would fall

‘ significantly short. .

Several articles expressed an interest-
ing point: the iPad will be a multi-purpose
device and is therefore, in the writers’
opinion, worthy of its larger price tag.

Yet its primary audience, book lovers,
has already embraced the Kindle. Those
same book «lovers would ﬁnd the additional

T features of the iPad unnecessary and thus

unworthy of its larger price tag.
Ultimately, Apple could face an inter-
esting dilemma, though they will not have
problems convincing people the iPad is
advanced. Its combination of small design
and integrated communication technolo-
gies clearly places it in that category.
The big question Apple will have to face
is whether it can woo those book lovers
from Amazon, as well as some full-ﬂedged
computer users from their laptops.

Tennis season opens with excitement’  

A refreshed women’s tennis team returns to the court Saturday to take on the University of Maryland

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

After suffering a season-ending in-
jury last year, senior Sabrina Vis-
ram will return to the Pitt women’s
tennis team as it begins the spring
season on Saturday. The Panthers
will travel to College Park, Md., for

a matchup against the Terrapins.
Visram, who played in the No.

2 position last season, tore her

ACL against Georgetown after 13

wins '—'— seven in doubles and six 1

in singles.

Head coach George Dieffenbach
said he hasn’t yet determined where
in the lineup Visram will ﬁt, which
leaves questions about the middle

 

 

and lower parts of the team. “She
is going to be contending to be in
the No. 4 or the No. 5 spot on the
team,” Dieffenbach said. “She’s a
very aggressive doubles player and
has all the shots in singles.”

The other player competing

for the four or ﬁve spot is Gabri— ‘

elle Cantanzariti. The freshman
has greatly improved, Dieffenbach

said, because she found a balance
between playing aggressive and
steady.

Other parts of the lineup have
already been sorted out. Elizabeth
Adams will play in the No. 1 singles
position, followed by Adela Aprodu
and Shannon Benic in the second
and third spots, respectively. Ad-
ams and Benic will team up to play

anna Dobrowolska and Nadine

tournament and represent the re-
gion at the national indoors com-
petition after ﬁghting off Adams
and Benic.

achieve 100 victories by reaching
101 wins during the fall season —

to take it one step higher:

At the Wilson/ Intercollegiate

“Adams and Benic played some
outstanding doubles [in the fall] ,”
the coach said. “Aprodu is a junior

ing very well right now.”

Dieffenbach said the team has
good depth, with Minh Evans and

daughter, rounding out the top
eight. ‘

Syracuse stageda remarkable sec-
ond—half comeback and gained the
lead with a minute left to play.
Buta 3-point play by Notre
Dame sealed its 74-73 victory,,and

Syracuse will look to get back that
Big Eastvictory.

The Panthers (12-8, 1-6 Big
East) have endured struggles
throughout the season, as they still
seek their ﬁrst conference victory
at home.

Head coach Agnus Berenato be-
lieves the focus of her team needs
to be on the next game —— the

match-up against the Orange ——
rather than on the other remaining
eight contests.

Still, Berenato also noted that
many Big East teams play a simi-
lar style of basketball, allowing
the Panthers to simultaneously
prepare for other conference op;
ponents.

Pitt hopes

to cash in

on resiliency    

After Saturday ’s signiﬁcant loss to UCorm, Pitt’s still ‘tough’

Women’s basketball 4' 11 '

Chelsea Cole, who leads the Big East with 11 rebounds per game, will look to help the
women’s basketball team when it takes on the Syracuse Orange tonight.

damentals of basketball,” she said. “A lot. '

of these Big East teams have tendencies in
their game that we can work on predicting
in practice.” 1

One tendency of the Syracuse team is to
get the ball in the hands of Nicole Michael,
a senior forward who leads the’Orange in
points and rebounds per game. g

Michael has 1,587 career points and is
just 18 points shy of setting the record for
most points at Syracuse.

In order to overcome such a dominant

V force, the Panthers must improve their re-

bounding, a statistical category dominated
by the Huskies in Saturday’s game.

Pitt forward’Chelsea Cole leads the Big
East in rebounds per game with 11 but she
only secured two in the loss to Connecti-
cut. _ “ .

From an offensive perspective, the Pan-
thers continue to rely on the efforts of Sims
and Taneisha Harrison. .

Balanced scoring has been an important
but diflicult goal for the Panthers since the

beginning of the season,’Sims, however,
feels that her teammates areready to step
up to the challenge.

“The coaches always tell us that everyone
can score,” Sims said. “People are starting

1 to step out of theircomfort zones and look

for the open shot.” 5

. Shayla Scott could be one of those indi-
viduals. With a team—high 18 points against
Connecticut, Scott reached a double-digit
scoring average for the season. '

_ This week will certainly test the Panthers’
resiliency and their ability to maintain Be-
renato’s “one game at a time” mentality,
as Notre Dame awaits a Saturday contest
against Pitt.

Berenato -knows her players are resil-
ient.
“When the going gets tough, the tough get

going,” Berenato such. .‘‘And we are a bunch

of tough people.” _

The Panthers hope to show their tough-
ness against the Syracuse Orange tonight at
the Petersen Events Center at 7 p.m.

we have good backups and good ‘

depth,” coach Dieffenbach said.
“That’s going to help us in playing
all those Big East matches.”

After ﬁnishing tournament play
in the fall, the team began practic-
ing again onjan. 18. The Panthers
started with conditioning two or
three times a week, which they
have now stepped up to ﬁve days
a week. .

Dieffenbach said the main goal
for the team this season is to earn

_ a winning record, particularly a

winning record against Big East

, conference opponents.

If they achieve that, Dieffenbach
said, Pitt will obtain a good seed in
the conference and qualify for the
conference championship;

“In the Big East championship,
our goal is to take it one step high-
er,” Dieffenbach said. “Last year, we
ﬁnished tied for seventh. This year,
‘we want to try and get to sixth.”

Overall, Dieffenbach said he
wants the team to practice like it

competes. If they do that, he said,
the Panthers will be prepared and
have an opportunity to win every}
match.

He said it’s important for the
Panthers to maximize their talents
with their mental abilities, so they
can match their strengths with op-
ponents’ weaknesses.

“Our job is always to win two
out of three doubles matches and
get the doubles point,” Dieffenbach
said. “That’s very important. Then,

- we want to ﬁnish strong and close

out those teams in singles.”

It’s going to be a good team,
he said, with both chemistry and
energy.

“We will do our best to take it
to a higher level and go after op-
ponents, particularly the Big East
opponents,” Dieffenbach said.

After opening the regular season
with their games against Maryland
on Saturday, Pitt will return home
to take on Big East rival West Vir-
ginia on Feb. 10.
