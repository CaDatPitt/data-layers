The English language, though
very well known to us, is like a
''““foreign- language to a deaf child,
-according to Dr. Powrie Vaus
', Doctor, professor of history and
political science at Gillaudet Col-
lege in Washington, D.C. Gillaudet
is a national college for the deaf.
,.In Pittsburgh to speak at the
Western Pennsylvania School for
Deaf, Dr. Doctor explained that
Gillaudet is a liberal arts college
with 608 deaf students. It is given
a 70 per cent subsidy by the fed-
eral government.

'University students can take a
.joint program in the training of
deaf children at Western Penn-
sylvania School for the Deaf. Sup-
erintendent of the school is Dr.
,Sam B. Craig. Dr. Craig was pre-
v-iously head of the teachers train-
. ing program at Gillaudet.

Deaf Deﬁnition-

According to Dr. Craig, a deaf
child may be deﬁned as “a child
whose loss of hearing is so great
that he can’t get along in a regular
school.”

“The main problem in teach-

. in; a deal‘ child is teaching him

’ how to communicate,” stated
Dr. Doctor.‘ Sign language and A
the manual alphabet are taught
mainly to adults. Children are
taught speech reading, or more
commonly, lip reading.

“The children can rarely speak
as well as we do,” said Dr. Craig,
“but they do speak in sentences;
and paragraphs the same as we
do.” “We arenow teaching them‘
to write in kindergarten or even

means of communication for‘
them,” continued ‘Dr. Doctor.

, New Improvements

Commenting on new -improve-

 ments in the field of audiology, Dr..
Doctor and Dr. Craig both agreed‘
that the use of hearing aids, dc-;
tecting deafness earlier, and get-;
ting an earlier start in teaching
the children are t.he main ones.

The painting of Irene Marcello
willvbe exhibited, for the ﬁrst

The Gallery is open Monday

DR. POWRIE VAUS DOCTOR
Professor at Gillaudet College for ‘the Deaf

“Since most of the children
have some realm of hearing,
electrical ampliﬁers, g r o u 1)
hearing aids, and individual
hearing aids are used as a help
with their speech work,” stated
Dr. Doctor. “We have teaching
machines, but it is too soon to
know their effect on the stu-
dents,” he also stated.

Deafness is not on the increase,
stated Dr. Craig. “Rather we are
able to detect. more cases due to
better techniques of health agen-
cies, screening at a .earlier age,
and audio_1ogists.”'

One In The World

The only college of its kind in
the world, Billaudet graduated 56
deaf students last year. Many of
the girls who graduate have gone
into library science work. “This is
because this job requires less com-
munication than most others,”
stated Dr. Doctor.

Many other graduates go into

"the teaching of the deaf and
others go into government work,
stated Dr. Doctor. “The ﬁrst
negro that ever graduated from
Gillaudet has started three
schools for the deal.’ in Africa,”
he continued. Other students
work on small town newspapers
and also do printing.

In conclusion Dr. Doctor ex-
plained that there will be an in-
ternational congress for the Coun-
cil on Education for'the Deaf held
at Gillaudet June‘ 22 to 28. The
council is composed of three or-
ganizations for the deaf. Repre-
sentatives will be from practical-
ly every nation. ‘

a‘ favorite teacher contest, in
which organizations on campus
would nominate a favorite in-
structor or -administrative‘ mem-
ber. Voting would be done by
monetary contributions.

The time aspect of'the proposed
campaign is also. under discussion.
The majority of the members
leaned toward establishing a ser-
ies of small drives with at least
one of .them occurring during
Homecoming, November 2 through
4. r .

The last successful Pitt Chest
campaign was held in 1958-59,
according to YMCA executive
secretary Alwyn M. Louden. In
the next two years only $600
was collected. _

“Pitt Chest died,” Louden said,
“because of, lack of leadership and
poor organization. This was a re-
sult of confusion when the tri-
mester plan began. Activity in all
student organizations declined
then.” ,

Louden, alongr-with Rev. Paul
Schrading, Methodist chaplain at
the University, attended as ad-
visors because of an SG request.

Committee members included
three SG Senators: Dave Men-
zer, Steve Pats, and Joe Seiger,
a representative from Alpha Phi
Omega, and one from Circle K.
Rev. Schracling. reported that

the Pitt Chest had reached its
peak in 1956-57 when $3200 was
raised. Schrading attributed this
to a drive for. charity for refugees
of the Hungarian Revolution.

Help For Ifomecoming l

Homecoming, one of the University’s few remaining
traditions designed for pure enjoyment, will receive a much-
needed shot in the arm this year by way of reconsiderations
given to the ﬂoat-parade and the Queen contest. 

Homecoming ﬂoats are back. On any campus, a parade of
ﬂoats designed to honor a football team, .a Homecoming
Queen and an alma mater is a completely’ illogical, unintel-
Ilectual, garish and time-consuming affair. But the ﬂoats are

_heartily welcomed back at the University.

An organized escape from the logical and the intellectual
‘is needed, for by various means and for various reasons, fun
has been attacked on campus in recent years. The annual
Spring Carnival was abolished some time ago, but is still
mourned by many. The trimester plan caused several annual

‘social events to be minimized. Formal dances have been
‘ shelved. But the decision to replace the building of floats at
VI-Iomecoming with the decoration of residences probably

displeased more people than any of the other restrictions on
student amusement.

But in addition to being pure fun for a greater number of
students, the concept of a float—parade' contains still another
merit. At the crowning of last year’s Homecoming "Queen, it
appeared to many that much of the gloss on the crown had

A been lost because of the lack of full-ﬂedged parade. The par-

ade and the Queen are as essential to Homecoming as the
football game; having no parade and thus reducing the charm
of the Queen’s office have hurt the celebration cdnsiderably
in the past few years. ' _ in
Fraternities have made a step in the right direction by
deciding against selecting a queen for the ‘Interfraternity
Ball. To say that this was done because it appeared that
there were “too many queen contests on campus” is to put
it mildly. The_position of Homecoming_Queen is only lessen-
‘ed by the numerous girls who are given similar honors
throughout the year.
A If the crown for the Homecoming Queen can become a
really prized possession and the supporting” organizations
attack the float contest with as much enthusiasm as has al-

ready been suggested, then Homecoming will recapture the

popularity and atmosphere which it deserves.

¢——--i—-Diminishing Dollars _. . .

Foreign Aid

strong Western world . . . can contain the Commu-

"gold and only if the dollar remains sound by re-

A In Monday's Pitt News, Mr. Kleinberg argued
for foreign aid because only “. . . an economically

nists.” I contend that: (1) foreign aid must be min-
imized because it is inextricably entangled in cer-
tain governmental policies which cause the gold
“problem,” and (2) it does not serve the purpose
it is supposedto serve.

The strength of the free world ultimately.rests
in the soundness .of the American dollar. But the
American dollar has become increasingly unsound.
On December 31, 1952, the U.S. gold supply totaled
$23.252 billion. On‘ September 17, 1962 this -total
had shrunk to $16.067 billion. European central
banks own $22.5 billion short-term dollar credits
redeemable in’ gold. Our. economic destiny, there-
fore, rests on the willingness of Europeans to hold
and invest dollars instead of redeeming them for
gold. A

’ They will retain these dollars only if they are
certain that the dollar will remain redeemable in

“vigor.”

taining its present value.,The.decrease_ _in the gold.
holdings of our country was caused, by deﬁcit
spending coupled. with credit expansion and the‘
ensuing decrease in the value of the monetary unit.
Since World War II, foreign aid has cost over‘ $90’
billion. It can be seen, therefore,that ‘foreign aid
has contributed substantially to budgetary deﬁcits.
Now budgetary deﬁcits are depressant factors _
in the economy. They are _not, as is commonly sup-
posed, inﬂationary. Dollars spent’ by the govern-
ment had to come from taxes. If the consumers
were taxed, therewas an ensuing loss of consumer
buying power. If the producers were taxed, cap-ital
accumulation and capital investment were retard-
ed. The reason that this is done is because deﬁcit

while purpose.

Let’s' look at therecord. Brazil, with $1
U.S. aid,_ has expropriated -some $14 -million of
property owned by Americans._ India, with $2 bil-

_1ion- U.S. aid, purchased. Soviet,MIG-21 ﬁghters.
, Ceylon, with_$71 million US. aid, -exipropriated $20
million of American oil installations and has used
them to distribute Soviet oil. .

Six Latin American‘ states with $3.7 billion US,
aid refused to. join us in reading Castro out of the.
OAS. And the height of ignorance was attained
when we gave $3 ‘billion US. aid to Yugoslavia and
Poland, two communist satellites. If this is success,
I would hate to experience defeat.

spending is the first phase in the process of gov-
ernmental stimulation of the economy.

The second and most important phase is the ex-
pansion of credit which is caused by the. ﬂooding
of the banking system with federal funds. Accord-
ing to Keynes, it is the function of government to
bring about full employment through credit expan-
sion and federal spending. Thus the government
plans a deﬁcit, prints the money, spends the money
and the result is an economy which operates with

,The unfortunate aspect of such a policy is tliat,
in the long run, the resultant inﬂation decreases the
value of the monetary unit and we are once again
faced with the problem of the loss of gold.

"Animal" Word Usage
Editor, the Pitt‘-News

From the pen of an inexperi-

enced, untrained "w-riteri, may I
suggest’ to your, thinking that

"words are too potent to throw

around inadvisedly;

Take “animal” for instan_ce.,I'
have heard, in-the very short
time that I have been here,.that
this word to some folks is synon-
ymous with “football player.”
Hearing it used’ by .a student
just the other day in a very
ordinary situation made me
know that what I had previ-

.ously heardwas true. Having

been brought up with a healthy
attitude toward the place of-
athletics in a life, I must say
I felt an unpleasant jolt. '
Now, if when using this word
you are referring to the like-
ness “typically capable of spon-
taneous movement and rapid
motor response as distinguished
from a plant,” then I guess you
are right, but if you are re-
ferring to some of the other sug-
gestions by Webster, then you

WILLIAM STEINBERG, director
chestra, appears to be enraptured

Steinberg Bewails 2
Size of Music Dept.

Bolstered by a podium, arms outstretched and extended

by _a fast—flying baton, William Steinberg, the director of
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, is a giant in the eyes

of music—loving people here.

Yet when pacing the floor of his living "room in his richly-
.decorated Squirrel Hill home he is strikingly small, special-

of the ‘Pittsburgh Symphony Or-
by his symphonic music. He com-
mented upon the lack of a full-ﬂedged music department here, and
especially upon the school's inability to furnish him a choir. '

ly when he props his elbow on hise

piano, while his feet dangle a foot
above the carpet.

Steinberg proved, however, that
he doesn’t need a baton to be
poignan; when he met the press
at his home- a few days ago prior
to the opening of the Symphony’s
36th season at Syria Mosque this
fall. I - ‘ ~

Refered To Abscence

He made keen references to the
absence of a full-fledged Music
Department at the , University.

“You have music appreciation
classes,” he exclaimed. “I don’t
even believe ‘:21 this term. You
can’t teach students to enjoy
music in a classroom. I believe
that every concert is a music
appreciation class.

“Of course, you have no music
department, and that’s it,” he
said. “You can’t evenfurnish m

. Desires Chorus

He explained that he has been
desirious of recruiting a chorus
from the University to compliment
his orchestra in the Mosque shows,
but that.he has been unable to
fulfill his wish. '

Instead ‘he combines the

choruses. of Carnegie Institute
of Technology and Duquesne

University.
vTech’s chorus normally has
about 70 members, while Du-

quesne boasts around 80. The Uni-
versity’s chorus claims between 45
and 50 members. ,

He did note, however, that some
of his biggest critics are associated
with the University. “One Pitt
professor, whom I shall not
name,” he said, “is constantly de-
riding me for not playing music
from the newly-developed coun-
tries.”

Critical Fallacy

— has extremely favorable sur-

Steinberg pointed out the fal-

M

lacy in this criticism, doting on

the evolution of music anywhere..
“There is some ﬁrstclassmusic,

coming out of these new coun-
tries,” he said, “but remember
music needs hundreds of years to
develop. \

“Look at our own America,”
he suggested. “How many real
American composers do we have
C Gershwin? ‘The only real
American composer today is
(Aaron) Copeland. He has the
real American idiom in his
works.” 1

But all is not scorn for Stein- ‘

berg’s music here. His press agent
secured the season ticket sales re-
cord for college students in this
city and the University .far sur-
passes the other-three in numbers
purchased. \

Interest Here

“There certainly is an interest
there,” Steinberg said. He then
expressed a vote of confidence for
Chancellor Li-tchfield’s plan to de-'
velop Oakland into -a cultural cen-
ter. i V '

“You should have m 0 n e y
enough,” he said, in his frank
manner. “Wish we had it.”

He then added that the school

roundings, noting the Carnegie
Library and. Museum, Syria
Mosque, Carnegie Music Hall--‘
and Forbes Field. _ -
Steinberg concluded that many
students feel that they have to

have “blue blood" to enjoy concert _

music. He said this is not so.

LEGE, St.. Peter, Minn., has been
offered a $200,000 gift by board
of trustees member Arnold J. Ry-
den to establish a distinguished

A ﬁne arts exhibit of pictures
painted by mentally

day. The display will consist of
paintings in oil, water colors,
pastels, crayons, and finger paints.

The art has been accumulated
from 11 foreign countries and 17

American institutions. The show;

Each work in the collection will

be accompani_ed by a descriptive,
evaluation of the intellectual and}

“creative expressions can be used
in diagnosis, therapy,‘ rehabilita-
tion, and education.”
Members Feel

The members of the organiza-

tion feel that “this 'is in no way
a fund raising project, but rather
a means of bringing to ‘he public
a visual reminder of the creative
expression of these special people
whosettalents may be overlooked

, According to Dr. Lionel Raps.-
port of the New York Psychi-

the exhibit, “Art is a way of

Review of “An American as Faust”

Lee’s Dramatic Poem

Sags With

By SUSANNA DOWNIE

I just saw An American As
Faust, a dramatic poem by Lawr-
ence Sock—it-to-’em Lee. I’ll be
OK- by tomorrow. I’ll take some
Alka-Seltzer. It’s supposed to be
good for ‘headaches, neuralgia,

acid indigestion, and indignant
amazement.
Not that I’m really against

squishy, under-done super-sweet
literary wedding cake, piled to the
procenium arch and covered with
pink-icing roses and rue. But,
God’s Bones, I don’t like being
whammed in the face with it for
an hour and a half in the name of
art. '

If you’ve got something to say
1 ‘J o u t LIFEJOYMOTHERHOOD
ANDBEAUTY, go ahead say it.
Mr. Lee, however, doesn’t seem to
be able to get beyond the upper-

case words.

Goes Nowhere

An American As Faust, which
might have made a good feminist
pot-boiler, just doesn’t go any-
where. Unless sagging in the mid-
dle of fuzzing off at the edges is
going somewhere.

The mood (sentiment) is ab-
solutely monolithic. W o r d s,
words, words, always the same
words. You just ean’t keep
generalizing all the time

But the production, as such, was
indeed the best that’s probably
ever been done of this particular
dramatic poem? The stage setting
was pared down from that in the
original script, which improved

I things.

_ No Mistakes

The pcrl'ormances were about
all anyone could hope l.or,’with
practically no missed cues, muffed

lines, burnt-out fuses or other
mechanical embarrassments.

First off, there's this Artist,
Frank Maradcn, who’s supposed
to be really complicated and
sensitive and all but actually
just reeks of stalwart, simple-
souled sincerity. Maraden is
pretty good, -— convincing, ex-
pressive — could replace James
Stewart.

Anyway, Artist has a longish
speil about Life and Man, with
modern French music dribbling in
and out

Man From Yale

He is eventually joined by The
Man from Yale, James Chapman,
an organization type who wants to
make his pile by selling John Q.
Faust, John Weiner, a crazy mix-
ed-up scientist, to John Q. Public,
crazy.

Faust, as a character, has got
such a huge classical dramatic
precedent to drag along that he
can hardly budge, which he
doesn’t. He just sits there most
of the time looking sexy and

sullen (What more could you
ask?).
Meanwhile, M a r g a r e t, Jan

Weidner, Yalie’s wife, also very
sexy, is sitting there gazing and
blinking up into the spotlights
and consequently is sort of dazed
most of the time, but it doesn’t
matter because she’s a nerd any-
way.
Just Friends

(Dig: “If I may not bear your
child, be my frienc.” Ha. Yalie
should try selling her to John Q.
Public. She could always do the
Halo commercial.)

In fact, one reporter, Carolyn

she wouldn’t mind bedding down

sold his jolly soul to Mad. Ave.

New Liberal Arts

 

Catalogue Late

A new Liberal Arts bulletin
will be ready before the end of
this trimester, according to Albert
B. Martin, Dean of the School of
Liberal Arts.

As soon as the bulletin has
been printed, copies will be avail-
able in the liberal arts advisory
center, 9CL and in the Oﬂice of
Student Records, 18CL. -

The bulletin has been reworked
over a period of two and one half
years in order to provide a bet-
ter structure and internal coher-
ence in undergraduate programs.
Martin said. There is also a need
for the upper level distribution
courses (180 courses) to be de-
veloped to a higher degree.

The bulletin was ﬁrst sched-
uled to come out last spring, but
new developments during the
summer and the many" changes
in department heads and program

areas have caused the long de- '

lay.

Letter Wrilin,(__{
Week Continues
Through S(iti(.r(Iay

The 25th observance of Letter
Writing Week will be held until
Saturday. This week is designated
each year to stimulate interest in
one of the oldest forms of com-
munication. _

The slogan of this year’s event
is “Keep Friends Near with Let-
ters.” “In these days of increased
living costs, a letter is still the
most economical and personal
means of conveying sentiments,
and is one of the best ways to
keep in touch with relatives and
friends in far away places,” re-
minds E. G. Coll, Pittsburgh Post-
master.

Hc suggests that everyone sit
down and write at least two let-
ters this week, that long—delayed
letter to a relative or friend and
another as a reply to a letter re-
cently received.

Joseph R. Vilella, a well-known
U.S. metallographer, has been
made an adjunct professor in the
School of Engineering and Mines.

Dean G. Raymond Fitterer, head
of the Schools of Engineering,
stated that Mr. Vilella had played
an important part in the develop-
ment of the science of metallo-
graphy in the United States and
that he was “proud to have him
join us on the University faculty.”

Mr. Vilella has held numerous
positions during his career as a
metallurgist. A graduate of Penn
State University, he has worked
for the Union Carbide and Carbon
Research Laboratories, the Funda-
mental Research Laboratory of
United States Steel Corporation
in Monroeville, and the Kearney
Steel Corporation.

Developed Techniques

While at Union Carbide, Mr.
Vilella developed many of the
techniques presently used in met-
allography, the study of the struc-

 

ture of metals
micrography.
He was the first to note that
polishing metal distorts its sur-
face and obscures its true struc-
ture, and he also developed the
method of alternately polishing
and etching the metal ‘surface.
He holds a patent for a process
for preparing levigated alumina,
used in the polishing of metals.

“Meta1lo-

He spoke in the American So-
ciety for Metals Education Lec-

' ‘ GREEDY GROUND GAINERS

,

BERKELEY, Calif. — The Pitt dressing room looked like

a brokerage house on Blue Monday following the 26-24 win
‘over the University of California. _ _
' All the coaches looked like someone had tied their shoe-
-~/laces together and stolen their dentures in one clean sweep.
—: ’””"/ Being glum; about such a victory is akin to selling in the
stock market. afteryour stock jumps five points, and then
seeing itinch another point the day after. _

But perhaps this is a good sign. It didn’t require a seis-
-mograph to realize that a lot of things about his team are
shaky at this point. Yet, it was .a victory, and isn’t it the
coaches who tell you, “it’s'the ﬁnal score that counts.”

Coach John Michelosen said the rushing attack-Wasn’-t as

Few ‘teams could be" as

Theteam did-manage, however, to grind out 205 yards
overlands, and they only. topped this total twice last year.
They gained 277 yards against Navy in‘ 1961, and 267 yards
against USC, both winning causes. ‘ /

And the longest -runs against the Bears were 17-yard .
dashes by Jim Traﬁcant and Paul Martha. Despite this
the Panthers did only muster two sustained drives — a

good cause for concern.

’The.tea'm only attempted eight passes and yet this de-
partment registered l69.yards and three touchdowns. Pitt ‘

only compiled over 100 yards passing in three games last
year, the'- high being a 190—yard output against Netre Darrre.

The total offense was 374 yards which is 65 more yards
than the Panthers garnered against Navy in 196l’s best effort.

At times this thesis was a bonaﬁde evaluation. We can’t
understand,‘ for example, why Cal was pillaging our team in
the dying moments of the game with such vi-gor.

In fact, this whole] team is’ too good to makethe kind

of mistakes _it does. The players, in general,‘ still feel that
the game was somewhat of a farce. Deep inside, they feel

‘ thatthey should have run California right out of the stadium.
They know they’re that much better.

But the coaches did‘ them convinced —_ and they had

Top Akron, 5-I
By GIL McD0NALD ’
After a ﬁrst half of evenly
matched soccer, George Shim-
peno broke loose for the ﬁrst ’
of three goals to start Pitt’s
5-1 rout of Akron U. Saturday.
Only two goals preceded the"

Shimpeno rally, one by each team.
Corky Cuthbert put the Panth

ers in‘ front _after ten minutes of _

the ﬁrst quarter with a shot’ he
ﬂipped over ,the diving Akron
goalie just beiore they collided.
Frank Abel, Akron inside left,
evened the game late in the third
quarter.-

That was all the Gold man- i ' 
aged, though, as Abel and‘ Pete-
Milich, who had 44 goals between 1

them last year, found too much
defense in Andy McGraw, Chuck
Dunbar and Rich Venglick. A

“We haven’t’ been hitting,” said i J“

Akron goalie Cart Suter. "‘Milich
can vdribble around anyone, but

we can’t score.” The Pitt defense?

refused to open up, though,’ and
the dangerous Milich took the col-
larjfor’ the day. —

With about a minute to go‘
in the third’ quarter, Shimpeno
came in sharply from his right
wing position to drill a grass-
cutting shot under Suter’s dive.

That was the ﬁrst of Shimpeno’s‘i T

personal offensive, and he made
Suter’s day miserable from then
on. . .
In the fourth quarter, the new-
ly-arrived Pitt Band salute d.
George’s overpowering s e c o n’d

steam in the Panther attack and
seemed to awe Akron. Shimpeno

score 4-1. ‘

University Athletes

This week’s issuelof Sports Illustrated bears the byline
of University Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld. _In an article
entitled “Saturday’s Hero Is Doing Finef’ the Chancellor, in

A the magazine’s words, “explodes the myth of the tramp ath-

says, “exploded with surprising
force the myth that athletes gen-
erally could not care less about
their studies.”

The survey shows that 517
men have gone beyond -their
baccalaureate to earn advanced
degrees. Only eight percent are
coaches or athletic administra-
tors, and of that number three-
fourths double as teacher-coach-
es. The range of career ﬁelds is
very extensive and the incid-
ence of success among Pitt ath-
lete has been remarkably high.

Pitt’s 1937 team was especially
cited. This team’s demand for $100
spending money on a Rose Bowl
trip gave it a bad name. Many of
these players have helped erase
this bad name with outstanding
post-graduate careers.

_ Many Leaders

Howard Jackman is executive
secretary of a Cleveland YMCA,
Emil Narick is assistant general
counsel for the United Steelwork-
ers of America, John T. Dickin-
son is an outstanding surgeon and
Marshall Goldberg, Pitt’s most
famous player is general manager
of a machinery corporation in
Chicago.

The quarterback of that team
has gone on to the coaching
ranks. He is John Michelosen.

The.Chancellor is not content
to rest on his laurels. Pitt, Penn
State andlsyracuse have taken
action to ensure integrity in future
‘collegiate athletics.

athletes -— from the freshman
class through the senior class —
and submit those records di-
rectly to the heads of the rival
universities. The penalty, if an
unqualiﬁed student ‘is found,
will be the elimination of that
school from future game sched-
uling. -«

This measure, Litchﬁeld hopes,
“will establish a pattern for a
national crackdown on the cheap
deceits by which winning teams
often are recruited and held to-
gether,” and goes to the heart of
the contention that college heads
must bear responsibility. V

Chancellor Litchﬁeld also re-
veals that the three universities,
which last April abolished red-
shirting, plan to‘ stop scheduling
of games for their freshman
teams. They feel, he says, that
“the current hard pace of studies
gives the freshman quite enough
to do just staying in college.”

The Chancellor .sums up Pitt’s
athletic philosophy by saying “we
must preserve the old competitive
values while conducting our sports
programs in the light of contem-
porary academic standards.”
