Poor transportation facilities and the ﬁnancial depression will,
I it is predicted, reduce attendance at Friday evening’s epoch-making
“Alumni Carnival” to a scant 9,000.‘ Itis feared that a few of the
boys who are now living in the Orient can’t get here in time, ‘and
four or five of the underg"raduates have jobs they can": get away from.
Of course, the other alumni andstudents, of the male persuasion, will
be on hand. Andﬂche faculty. But, all told, there’lI hardly be a
larger attendance than that at Forbes Field on Thanksgiving. Its
backers concede this,_’but claim by way of alibi that the crowd’ll be

even more exclusive. . ' '

For the benefit of the “Old Grad” who forgot to read his an-
nouncement, we summarize the program herewith:

Friday evening, June 10. Alumni Hall. ‘Get there by eight at
latest. Enter by East door or at front (main) entrance. Shake hands with
Tim Hurst, Pat McP'arland, Harry Meller, Jo-hn Martin, Paul Hay and
Tony Goldberger. Swap your hat for a Blue: and Gold one. Make
Bob Grove or George Ketchum give you a couple of noisemakers and
some smokes. Spend two. bits for a strip of amusement tickets.

Look at the Hall of Fame and other exhibits on the first floor,
then grab hold of ‘three of the old gang (they'll be there!) and-hike
on up to The Midway (second floor), Have a look at The Fat Lady;
the Strong Man and the,Greai: Whatizzit. See Williams and Ankeny
in the greatestdance hit‘of the century, and Wainwright and Liggett
in the only performance as good as Williams and Ankeny.’s. Buy a
sack of peanuts, two lollypops and some cones.

Keep on to the third floor. Spend a half hour laughing at some
first-release comedies, take half a dozen ‘shots at the Agile African,
and don": fail to inspect the Wildest Man Borneo Ever Produced.
Win a Teddybear- and two Kewpie Dolls at the big paddle wheel.
Treat the gang to crackerjack and lap up a few schooners of that
famous pink circus lemonade. ’

Mosey on back to the first floor, stopping en route to toss a
few rings around the canes, at the stand on The Midway, and sneak
into the “Why Girls Leave Home” and “For Men Only” shows- Give
your cars a treat by listening in- on Scotch Sandy’s bagpipe serenade.

Back on theground floor again? invest in a el.ab- of Georgia
watermelon, and have some more free pink lemonade. Hear the
Novelty Four, the gang that invented Jazz and brought it to its pres-
ent state of perfection. . .  —

About time for the going to ring! Snap into it——gr-ab off a re-
served seat for the badger fight, the bloodiest of all brute combats.
Watch Jock SutherIand’s champions slug each other through nine
hectic rounds—if they don’1: slaughter each other in_the meantime!
Stand by while a troupe of blood-drinking African assassins tear each
other limb from limbin the Battle Royal. '

Then——if you've seen all the old gang and broken your balloon
and drunk enough “Ice Col’ Lemo”-—you can 0 home.

That's about all of the program that’s been announced, so far.
But with chalky Williamson -and Arnold Replogle and Joe Richardson
and Alphabetical James and that gan doing.-lathe organizing, you can
bet ‘there’ll be plenty doing. .

Ketch: says, “Buy your tickets in advance; how do we know
whether to put another lemon in‘ the lemonade?”

The committee of Engineering alum-
ni, headed by John Weber, chairman,
which is handling the annual lunch-
eon at the Fort Pitt Hotel, June 14,
has gotten out 5. unique blue printed
notice which is now in the hands of
all grads -of Dean Bishop’s school.
It has the heading “Professor Stewart‘
Condu-cts Class in Machine Design and
Modern Inventions for ,-Pitt Engineer-
ing Alumni,” and describes a_ myster-
ious apparatus which has come to his
attention recently for the manufacture
of some sort of "“Mash.” It is even
hinted that the good Professor may
go into the details of a. recipe for this
“Mash” which will be good news to
the Engineers. Dr. Walther Riddle

Death, with its awful suddenness,

shocked hundreds of Pitt alumni,
when it. snatched Dr. J. ‘Lorentz
Scott, ’20, from our midst Sunday
night. “'Scotty,” one of the most pop-
ular and ‘brilliant boys Pitlrever turn-
ed out, succumbed to dread pneu-
monia which developed after an oper-
ation for appendicitis. The operation
was apparently successful and he
seemed to be on a. fair road «to re-
covery when the -complication set in.
With the characteristic energy that
marked his whole career, brave little
“lsbotty” fought his hardest for life
but the end ﬁnally came about mid-
night ‘Sunday, in the Allegheny Gen-
eral Hospital. ‘

 

DR. J. LOREN Z SCOTT, ’20

For the writer, words are absolute-
ly inadequate in telling of the quali-
ties of this loved friend. For years
he had been closely associated with
him, especially during -the early part
of his career as a student in the Uni-
versity. He served his term. as ath-
letic apprentice manager and ﬁnally
became Varsity Managerof the 1917
basketball team. 'His friendly smile
and ever present good humor made
friends for him every place he went
and he was always looked on as one
of the most efﬁcient and best liked
managers Pitt e-ver had.

After he completed his work on the
lower campus and went to the Medical
-school he did not have the time for
student activities but plunged into
his medical studies with the idea of
getting the most thorough-‘preparation.
for his -career. He gradi/rated in 1920
as one of the leading students in his
class and was assigned to the Alle-
gheny General Hospital 3.‘Sl an Interne.
In the hospital he was the favorite
of everyone, from the ,best known
physician, down to the janitors.

“Scotty”! had a. brilliant career
ahead of himas a -physician and sur-
geon. As a mere youngster he met.
with a very serious injury to one of
his legs and for awhile itwas feared
that tuberculosis would develop. Dr.
David -Silver, one of the most famous
specialists in such’ cases in the coun-
try, attended him and brought him
through the crisis ‘absolutely sound.
The result was that a great attach-
ment grew up petween the noted
physician and “Scotty” and it was on
his advice that he decided to take up
the ‘medical profession. - Following
out the. ‘re-arranged program.
“Scotty” was to have become’ one or
Dr. Silver's assistants immediately
after the completion of his work as
lnterne in the Allegheny General

Hospital about July 15. ‘
“Scotty” was a member of the Sig-
ma -Chi and Nu Sigma Nu Fraternities
as well as-many other University or-
ganizations. ; ‘-

PITT AND RADIUM

 

The visit of Madame Curie to the University brings back the
-memory of a famous Pittsburgher, James  Flannery, who estab-
" lished the radium industry on a -ﬁrm basisin this country. When
Mr. Flannery decided to begin the production of radium on a large
scale he found himself faced by a lack of chemists experienced in

, ,
radium preparation. _ . _

To ﬁll these necessary positions, he needed chemists of ability

and adventure. In two Pitt men, graduates of 191-2 cl.ass of the
School of Chemistry, Mr. Flannery discovered two of the men de-
sired. They were Glenn D. Kammer and‘Henry J. Koenig,_both of
whom in 1913 participated in the preparation of the ﬁrst radium salt
made in America at the Pittsburgh laboratories of the Standard
Chemical Complanyl ‘ 6 V _

Mr. Kammer is still with the Standard Chemical Company, but

Mr Koenig has gone to the Radium Company of America’s labora-
' \ . .
tories at Denver, Colorado. These two men in 1920 supervised more
than two-thirds of the world’s total production of radium. Through
Mr Kammer’s hands in the Pittsburgh laboratories has passed more
thanﬁone-half of the total known supply of radium in the World-

The world is indebted to. Pitt in that it has produced two such

men—chemists, not only capable, but also adventurous and visionary.

Saturday they will liave ended a
most. successful year. L_

The Varsity played the Allegheny
College. team to a tie last Friday. Llt
should have been a Pitt victory, but
while the Panthers -disposed of their
opponents handily in the singles they
played rather poorly in the doubles
and allowed their opponents to gwin
‘both matches, thus tying the score
at three~all. fPie-‘Williams was the
stellar -light or the match for after
losing his ﬁrst set he came back in
great shape and took ‘ the next two
‘straight. ' The score follows:
L.G/8ing1es~.—4Cochran . .(A) defeated

reeng (P), 8-6", 6-3.. Williams (P)
defeated‘ Flint (A), -3-6, :8-6, 6-3.

'The‘ following day the team went
to S'tate»*but on accountof rain ‘they
were unable to ﬁnish their matches.
Williams‘ again played’ a_ prominent
‘part, -as he vvon his singles‘ match.
At» the time of the cessation of hos-
tilities the score stood as follows:
