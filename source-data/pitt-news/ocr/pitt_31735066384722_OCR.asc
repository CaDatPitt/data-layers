‘Arab Sheik’ Can
Run by Students

TlTUSVILLE—A half—dozen students at Pitt’s
Titusville campus recently displayed plenty of
imagination—and a fair amount of imagined wealth
and power——when they spent a weekend touring this
small oil-country community impersonating an
Arabian sheik and his entourage.

“We just thought it

The six students roamed through Titusville for the

remainder of the weekend, attracting stares and

abuse from undoubting onlookers. The hoax went so
far as to include rampant rumor-that the prince was

Clerical Union Agree 'Tentatively'

In ﬁling an election petition, the
union is requesting a vote by the
employees on whether to allow the
union to represent them.

In order to be granted an election,
the union must have ‘ ‘union
support” cards signed by at least 30
percent of the employees.

According to Eileen McManus,
the union organizer, that percen-
tage has been reached.

Thomas A. Cherry, director of
employee relations at Pitt, stated
last month that the signed cards do
not necessarily indicate a clear
support for the union. He added
that many of the employees signed
the cards to put the unionization
question to a vote.

Gustav D. Reincke, assistant vice
chancellor for human resources,
said a “tentative agreement” was
reached between the union.and the

In Gubernatorial Race

University as to allowing the
election to take place, but another
meeting would be held at the
Board’s downtown office to
continue negotiations.

The question of unionization was
put to a vote once before in 1976
with more than 1700 workers
involved. According to Cherry, 62
‘percent of the employees voted
“against’ ’ unionization then.

New Program

Council Gains

A Chairman

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Tammy Haddad, a senior

English-Communications major,
has been named general chairman
of the newly organized Pitt Union
Program Council, effective June 1.

The Council, developed by a joint
effort of the Student Government
Board (SGB) and the Ofﬁce of
Student Activities, was created to
centralize student programming on
campus.

“There has been an overlapping
of programs in the past,” Haddad
said, “and we want to put it all
together and make sure the needs
of all students are met.”

In the past, money for program-
ming has been allocated to various
campus groups such as Engineer-
ing organizations, Inter-fraternity
Council, Black Action Society and
the Franklin Pangborn Film Club.

The new centralized agency,
according to Haddad, will coordi-
nate the efforts of these groups to
reach a broader range of students.

“We would like to make it so that
the money covers all the students, ”

Hadded. said. “We also want to. , . _

give the students the chance to
develop their own programming.”

In addition to Haddad’s appoint-
ment by the SBG and Ofﬁce of
Student Activities, six chairman
have been chosen, representing
different departments of the
Council.

Kim Popovich will serve as
cultural arts chairman, Debbie
Alpert will assume the special
interest chair, Steve Vance is the
new music chairman, Greg
Johnson is recreation chairman,

, Scott Brown is lecture chairman

and Nancy Whitaker will be visual

Vance and Brown are seniors
while Popovich, Alpert, Johnson
and Whitaker are juniors.

Haddad, who resides in Pleasant
Hills, said her chairmanship will be
a “coordinating position” over the
six different departments.

“I’ll have to justify all the things
we do,” she said.

Haddad had been active as RSA
programming chairman this past
year and was a member of the
Tower B dorm council and the
public affairs committee of the
SGB.

Casey, Thornburgh Emerge As Leaders

By The Associated Press

Republican Richard Thornburgh
of Pittsburgh and Democrat Robert
P. Casey have emerged as leaders
in the state’s gubernatorial race,
according to a survey conducted by
the Associated Press.

Thornburgh, the former United
States attorney, leads ﬁve other
Republican candidates in 30 of the
state’s 67 counties. Casey, the
former auditor general, is ahead of
four other opponents in 38
counties.

These results are far from
conclusive because there is no way
to judge the voter turnout or the
amount of the majority in each

county. It is possible for a
candidate to roll up a large vote in a
few big counties, run a close
second or third in a lot of others,
and win.

“The whole race is so fragment-
ized all you can do is throw all the
names in the air and see who hits
the ground first,” said Robert
Davis of the Franklin News-Herald
in Venango County.

The rest of the ﬁeld breaks down
this way: -

Democrat——Peter Flaherty, for-
mer Pittsburgh mayor, and
Lieutenant Governor Kline, both
leading in 11 counties, with seven
still a tossup.

I Republican-—Arlen Specter,

former Philadelphia district attor-
ney, and Robert Butera, who
resigned last year as House
minority leader after 10 years as a
state representative, each leading
in 12 counties; State Minority
Leader Henry Hager, six counties,
with seven too close to pick.

David Marston, the Philadelphia
prosecutor fired by President
Carter and endorsed for the
Republican nomination by United
States Senator Richard Schweiker,
was cited by many as a dark horse.

A telephone poll conducted by
The Associated Press asked editors
and political writers throughout the

state one question: “Who do you

believe will win the gubernatorial
nominations in your county?”

I “A lot of people haven’t made up
their mind and probably won’t until
primary day,” observed Robert
Marchio of the Hanover Evening
Sun in York County.

William Morgan, of Luzerne
County's Hazleton Standard-
Speaker, said, “This is the dullest
campaign I've ever seen. Nobody is
talking about the election."

“There is no grass-roots
feeling,” said Robert John of the
Johnstown Tribune-Democrat in
Cambria County. “People are
disgusted, fed up with govern-

.ment, yet show no interest.”

Soviet Sfeelmakers Visit City

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH-—A delegation of Soviets looking for business in
the heart of the U.S. steel industry yesterday brought the U.S.S.R. ’s
latest steelmaking technology to Pittsburgh.

The Soviets explained advanced techniques for recasting steel
into pure, uniform metal that can be used to build critical hardware
suitable for military, space and arctic use.

‘ ‘We are trying to ﬁnd out what’s the scope of this technology and
how they go about doing something at fairly reasonable or low
costs,” said Dr. Kris Bhat of the Carnegie-Mellon Institute of
Research.

Bhat, who has corresponded under a protocol arrangement with
the Soviets for 11 years, said the’visit was a chance for U.S.
producers to examine Russian technology in electroslag melting,
welding and casting.

The process was developed in the United States and first put into
commercial use by the Sovietsiin 1961. It is used to melt special
alloys difficult to produce in conventional arc furnaces.

“For the past 30 years they have been developing sophisticated
melting techniques for high alloy, low alloy and also aircraft and
aerospace alloys,” Bhat said.

He said the Russians’ advancement can be explained by their
more intense and methodical research efforts.

‘ ‘The Soviets have a tendency to put out a massive effort’, whereas
we have to identify a need and satisfy that need,” Bhat said.

Carter Pushes Solar Energy

By The Associated Press

GOLDEN, Colo.——President Carter marked “Sun Day’
yesterday by ordering a new Cabinet-level study to develop‘ a
national solar strategy and by praising solar energy as a potential
counterweight to rising oil prices.

In remarks prepared for delivery at the Solar Energy Research
Institute here, however, Carter didn’t promise any new funds for
solar research. But the president noted that his proposed budget‘ for
ﬁscal 1979 contains a 64' percent increase in money for‘develooment
-of solar power over the federal budget of two years ago.

:On the ﬁrst day of a three-day swing through Colorado,
California, Oregon and Washington, Carter announced that the
Agriculture Department will lend $14 million to the city of Lamar.
Colo., for a project to turn livestock excrement into methane gas.

Carter had lost all four states to Gerald R. Ford in t-he 1976
election, and his Western tour was billed by the White House as an
effort to win public support for administration programs.

Cancer Causing Asbestos
Found In Navy Ships

By The Associated Press

LONG BEACH, Calif.-—Three years after the Navy banned the
use of asbestos in its ships, at least four naval vessels were
commissioned that were insulated with the cancer-causing agent,
union ofﬁcials say.

The four ships, all recently serviced at the Naval Shipyard here,
have asbestos insulation on pipes, according to Charles Ay,
president of Asbestos Workers Local 20,’ and Andy Abbott,
president of the shipyard’s Metal Trades Council.

Asbestos is known to cause cancer, and just last week Health,
Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph Califano Jr. warned that as
many as 5.6 million Americans may die of cancer or other diseases
as a result of exposure to asbestos in shipyards and other
workplaces. ’

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Q

Primary Reporting

Journalists across the state have found voters unconcerned about
the upcoming primary. The writers and editors blame the apathy
on the large number of candidates, which confuse voters, and post-
watergate disgust.

An honest press might look a little further and find they are part-
ly to blame for the problem. News coverage of the gubernatorial
race in Pittsburgh has been confined mostly to articles on
hometown» boys such as Flaherty. Until this week, a newspaper
reader had to scour Pennsylvanian dailies to find any other stories
about the developing gubernatorial primary campaigns. With
voting day only two weeks away, election news is still confined to
the inside pages. I

Since there are so many candidates, the news media should strive
to present an abundance of information on them to help the elec-
torate .wisely choose the most qualified nominees. To do this

‘adequately, editorial staffs across the state must focus on more

than events such as occassional speeches and fund raisers.

The past performance of each candidate must be. tediously
examined to show their expertise or incompetence. Most of the
candidates have considerable experience in government, so the
public record can be studied to find information about their ability.

Candidates all address corruption in Pennsylvanian government

as the main issue, and everybody promises to destroy it. State-

ments by nominees tying all the state’s problems to corruption
should be analyzed to find the validity of those claims. —

This year, voters must scrutinize potential governors with a skep-
tical eye. Governor Shapp will leave state government in a finan-
cial crisis without adequate funds to supply the services demanded
by citizens. Pennsylvania’s next governor needs to be a man with
spectacular ability if the Commonwealth plans to pull itself out of
the present fiscal crunch.

The media statewide has the power to help electors select such a
governor if they fulfill their primary funciton in American society,
to inform the public. Completing this purpose just requires a little
extra effort from reporters, writers and editors who _ should
consider it their professional duty to do their jobs well.

Letters to the Editor

Jan Medoff’s Irrelevant Statements

Your April 14 article by Tom
Kukucka reports the results of a
Student Government Board survey
of student opinion concerning the
merits of the plus-minus grading
system instituted last fall. It quotes
SGB member Jan Medoff as saying,
“We as students—people paying
the bills—have a right to determine
how we are evaluated.”

I altogether deplore this state-
ment.

The taxpayer and the student pay
for the instruction received by the
student, but the grades received in
courses have to be earned by

academic achievement. How that
achievement is best evaluated must
be determined by academically
relevant considerations and not by
Medoff’s crass irrelevancy that the
student pays the bills.

And if it were at all germane to
determine who does pay the bills, I
would remind Medoff that the
taxpayer has given the faculty and
administration the mandate to set
educational standards. It would be
decadent to abdicate this mandate
to students.

It is, of course, quite possible the
reasons that prompted the adoption

of the plus-minus grading system
by the faculty are unsound.

Furthermore, students may welli

contribute information that is
indeed useful for the academic
appraisal of this system. But I am
dismayed to learn that any student
at all should think, as Jan Medoff
reportedly does, that students have
the right to decide between a
ﬁne-grained and coarse-grained
system of grades on the ground of
purportedly being the “people
paying the bills.”

PERSPECTIVE

“Defending the ex-
pansion of atomic power
plants because we have
managed to avoid ac-
cidents so far is like let- .
ting a child play with a
loaded pistol because it
hasn’t accidently ﬁred
yet. ” -

expertise necessary to run it.

Besides the lack of any workable
disposal system, the danger of an
accident at a ﬁssion reactor haunts
everyone. There are already two
examples of near disasters at
nuclear generators in the United
States.

In October, 1966, the Enrico
Fermi experimental nuclear breed-
er reactor went critical and the core
partially melted through the
concrete retaining walls before the
reactor fuel was cooled through
emergency procedures.

A ﬁre at the Brown’s Ferry
nuclear plant in 1975 disabled the
emergency pumps designed to
supply water to the reactor’s cooling
system. Water level dropped from
200 inches to only four feet above
the core. Personnel at Brown’s
Ferry admitted the accident was
nearly disasterous.

If the enriched uranium fuel had
not been quickly cooled in those two
cases, the core could have melted
through the thick concrete and steel
reactor walls and released poison-
ous radioactive fumes into the
atmosphere. The proximity of many
plants to major population centers
means hundreds of thousands could
be killed or harmed by such an
event. .

Atomic industry apologetics’
downplay the chance of any mishap
by stressing that plant personnel
averted accidents at the Enrico
Fermi and the Brown’s Ferry
reactors. That stand by. ﬁssion
energy advocates is, at best, a
superﬁcial argument.

Defending the expansion of
atomic power plants because we
have managed to avoid accidents so
far is like letting a child play with a
‘loaded pistol because it hasn’t
accidently been ﬁred yet.

The Atomic Energy Commission
estimates there will be 1000 nuclear
plants in the United States by the
year 2000 at the present building
rate. As the number of reactors
increases, the probability of a fatal
disaster grows proportionally. Our
nation cannot afford to gamble with
human life and health through
proliferation of ﬁssion reactors.

Safer energy sources which the
Government should develop exist
besides nuclear power. Solar
energy, geothermal energy, fusion
energy and wind energy are less
dangerous sources of electricity to
which the Department of Energy
and private energy producers have
given only slight attention.

That power utilities’ ignore these
sources is understandable. They've
put massive investments into

uranium_ mines, uranium refining
and enrichment plants, nuclear
power plants and waste disposal.
After placing millions of dollars into

reactors produce no poisonous
wastes and can never go critical.

Splits with Schweiker

“Senator Heinz Endorses

Thornburgh as Governor

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON —Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., breaking with his Senate colleague,
endorsed Richard Thornburgh over David
Marston for the Republican nomination for
Pennsylvania governor today, saying: “It is
time for someone who will make us an
proud.”

Both Heinz and Thornburgh told a news
conference they would support.Marston in

_ .. the general election campaign if he wins the

nomination in the party primary.

Heinz’s announcement put him at odds
with his senior Senate colleague from
Pennsylvania, Republican Richard
Schweiker, who has endorsed Marston.

Marston, who once was Schweiker’s
administrative assistant, entered the
governor’s race after his widely publicized

Pittsburgh and a former deputy U.S.
attorney general.

He said Marston had done a good job as a
prosecutor, but “the question is whether the
people of Pennsylvania are going to be
satisﬁed with a media superstar as their
governor.”

Thornburgh said he thought his own
executive experience and his experience in
private business qualiﬁed him better for the
job.

Heinz said he would participate in
fund-raising activities for Thornburgh but
has a policy of not contributing his own
money to political campaigns of other
candidates. Heinz is a millionaire.

Heinz praised Thornburgh as a man of

“competence and compassion” who had

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG_-evojters must
decide on May 16 if they want to
make what may be the most
important change in state govern-
ment structure in over a century-
whether the state attorney general
should be elected.

A second, less significant ques-
tion, involves a technical change in
the state constitution to clear up a
dispute over how long judicial
appointments run.

The constitution is vague on

-‘whether a person named to an

interim judicial appointment must
step aside once a person is elected
to the same post.

The ballot question asks for an
amendment that a judicial appoint-
ment expire when a replacement is
elected.

Statevofﬁcials pushing for an
elected attorney general say the
people are demanding a voice in
the selection of the state’s chief law
enforcement officer.

The attorney general should be
independent of the governor and
take stronger measures against
government corruption and
organized crime, proponents

Shapp and other
ofiicials opposed to the change
contend‘ the voters are being
misled. They may think they’re
buying a good government_reform,
but once the wrapper’s off, they
may instead ﬁnd a costly and
possibly destructive addition to
state government, the officials say.

Laws permitting wiretapping and
providing immunity to witnesses
are needed to ﬁght corruption, not
an elected attorney general,

pponents contend.

ince 1974, the governor has
inted the attorney general
with the advice and consent of the
Senate.

Department, including the state

Commission, and the Office of

Commission, which controls

The appointed system came
under attack in 1974 after Shapp
named his campaign manager,
Robert Kane, as attorney general.

CBS Makes Poor Showing With Replacements

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Another Day
CBS

“Another Day” is basically a
vehicle for David Groh, formerly
Valerie Harper’s husband on
“Rhoda.” When divorce severed
Groh from the cast, CBS have Groh
a show of his own, with none other
than Joan Hackett as his wife.

Groh plays an advertising
executive; and Hackett plays a
housewife who is successfully
exchanging that role for that of the
working woman. They have two
precocious kids and a live-in
mother-in-law (his). If it sounds

like something out of the 1950’s, it
should. Except for a few updated
digs by chauvinist Groh, this is
straight Lucy and Desi.

And it would not be so bad if
Hackett didn’t moon about dizzily
with those pseudo-intellectual
musings in her nasally Bostonian
voice.

Groh is rather good,
low-keyed and natural.

But the plots are something else.
In the opener, Groh tried to retrap
Hackett into servitude by asking
her to have another child. Not bad
in itself, but when he got the kids
and mom together for a vote—well,
cutesiness does not make for good
comedy.

Could you defend yourself if
you were attacked? T If the
answer is no, then you need the
self-defense course offered by
Leisure Learning Tuesday from
4-5 pm. at the dance studio at
the corner of Forbes and
Oakland Avenue.

The instructor, Curtis Smith,
will emphasize basics that will
enable the participants to
escape from the grips of an
attacker and then ﬂee.

People need not be strong or
large to take the course, nor are
they required to take falls. The
course will deal with easily
learned and applied tactics that

guarantee success when prop-
erly applied.

Smith is a certiﬁed police and
self-defense instructor. He has
offered similar courses at
Carnegie—Mellon University,

and the Y.W.C.A. He is
known for his mastery of
weapons and is ranked number
one in Pennsylvania for this
skill. He is a member of the
Tri-County Peace Officers
Association and is an A.A.U.
silver medal winner. He has

The Ted Knight Show
CBS

In another second-banana-
elevated-to-stardom routine, there
is “The Ted Knight Show.” Ted
Knight, of course, .was the
egocentric anchorman on “The
Mary Tyler Moore Show.” He was a
ﬁne actor, winning two Emmy

awards for ‘the role. Knight’,s
attempt here doesn’t work,
however. ' i

The storylines are definitely

flimsy. One episode featured
Knight trying to impress his ex-wife
when he found out she was
remarrying into high society.
Unfortunately, his sophisticated
date fails to show, and he must
make do with an airhead from his
rent-a-girl agency. Of course, his
plans go awry,ibut he comes back
with a few putdowns to the snide jet
setters.

Catch Ted Knight on “Mary
Tyler Moore” reruns; he's just not
worth it here.

The Amazing Spiderman
CBS

Comic strips come to life again.
This time, Nicholas Hammond
portrays everybody’s favorite
araclinid.

This show has ‘got to be the
biggest gimmick this side of
“Batman” reruns. Hammond,
amazingly enough, is rather good,
but the show is predictable and the
dialogue is updated Buck Rogers.

Well, almost. Jill Clayburgh is

clearly, an over 30 housewife.named
Erica whose husband (Michael

Murphy) dumps her for a woman he .

met at Bloomingdales.
She’s thrown in the midst of the
swinging singles scene, a world

4. a (4 at Kt, A ,.~,.,wr.,

  

alien to a woman who has always
been safely set up in “the perfect
marriage.”

Erica soon meets up with two men
whose only similarity is their
availability. Alan Bates, an
underrated actor, is excellent as
Erica’s artist lover, Saul. Cliff

'Gorman nearly matches Bates’

excellence in his portrayal of
Charlie, the sleazy macho swinger.

The picture belongs to Clay-
burgh, however. Her last starring
role found her miscast as the spoiled
heiress in “Semi~Tough,” and it

has been a long wait to see if she”
, would ever live up to her potential.

But the wait was worth it, for here
Clayburgh emerges as one of the
best actresses around. Her Erica is
truly believable, touching, and
bittersweet. She’s alternately
naive, then worldly; a mistress,
then a mother. But the change is
fluid and sincere.

Director Paul Mazursky, who so
often runs to excess, has stayed
fairly controlled in ﬁlming “An
Unmarried Woman.” The film
works on a personalized level, and,
despite the title, it does not jump
onto the bandwagon of the so—called
women’s pictures.

The picture was filmed‘ entirely
on location in New York City, which
also invites comparison with‘
television’s “Rhoda,” but the
background is essential: New York
personiﬁes the jungle of the singles
scene where the prey is human, but
only remotely. T

Bill Conti’s score works well
a1so—a perfect complement to
Erica’s moods.

“An Unmarried Woman” is not a
revelation, nor is it a great message
for divorcees. ‘But it is a ﬁne ﬁlm

with the oil industry,” the letter advised, “but that
view has now changed.”

“I had visions of $2 million going down the drain
when I read that,” said Ball, who called the trick
“good-natured” when advised of the crown prince’s
true identity.

which included stops in Erie and—where else?—Oil

City.

The crown prince issued several post-trip state-
ments on his official wax-sealed stationery. A letter
was sent to——and published by—the Herald extolling
the area as “an excellent location in which to live,
work and invest.” But the best communication was
reserved for Ball, the campus’s top man.

The prince had been “rudely insulted by students”

during a visit to, campus, according to the letter to
Ball, and the school’s student housing was deemed

‘ ‘deplorable.’ ’

“His Excellency was planning to send his nephew

dents.

Krysinski and his associates are said to have
become “folk heroes” among Pitt-Titusville stu-

“Some people go to Walt Disney World and spend
a thousand dollars,” Krysinski explained. “We just
did it in Titusville, that’s all.”

Any student attending classes
during the spring and summer
sessions who is interested in a
position on either the Campus or
Residence Hall Judicial Boards may
pick up an application in 104
Schenley Hall. Both boards act as
juries during hearings involving
alleged violations of the Student
Code of Conduct and Supplemental
Residence Hall Provisions.

The Residence Hall Judicial
Board is composed of students who
have lived in University housing for
a year and are currently living
there. The board hears cases
originating in the residence halls.

Sports  

 

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The going has been rough for Pitt’s
baseball team (9-12). ‘

“We’re in a slump,” said Panther coach
Bobby Lewis, whose team has lost seven of
their last eight games, including two
straight doubleheaders to West Virginia and
Cleveland State. “Our pitching has been
adequate, but we haven’t been getting the
hitting to back up the pitching.”

The Panthers’ only win in the past week
came in a doubleheader split at Buffalo State
last weekend. They have since lost to
Louisville, Buffalo (twice), West Virginia

and Cleveland State (two doubleheader '

According to Lewis, there are several
reasons behind Pitt’s poor results; the
hitting has been poor, the pitching hasn’t
been much better’ and the fielding has been
bad.

Lewis thinks the biggest reason is that Pitt
hasn’t been getting the big break.

‘ ‘In our doubleheader with West Virginia,
Don Nania (Pitt’s centerfielder) made a

their (WVU’s) hitters hit a ball deep to
center that Don caught tumbling over the
fence at Trees Field.

“Evervone thought it was an out, but the _

umpires ruled that Donnie didn’t have his
feet planted before catching the ball.‘ He
went ﬂying through the air and over the
fence to catch the ball.

‘ ‘It was a tough break,” Lewis continued.
“West Virginia got two runs out of that hit.
We ended up losing that game, 4-2.”

Another Panther problem is that they’ve
been forced to play catch-up ball so often.
Pitt has been outscored by its opponents,
19-7, in the first inning. Falling behind

situation in which they have to come up with
a big hit or a big out.

“There's a big difference between when
you’re winning a ball game and when you’re
behind,” Lewis said. “Playing catch-up
baseball, you can’t take chances as often.
You’re in a situation where you have to score
some quick runs just to get into the ball
game.”

Indiana State on the schedule this weekend,

“One of

Eight Panthers Selected in Annual NFL-Draft

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
After the final computer
printout had been mulled over and
Peter Rozelle’s version of “Let’s
Make a Deal” ended, eight Pitt
Panthers had been selected by NFL
teams and the Pittsburgh Steelers
took definite steps to bolster last
season’s anemic kicking game.
The parade of Panthers, which
began with Randy Holloway in the
first round and ended with Tom
Brzoza in the eleventh, offered
some surprises, both good and bad.
Matt Cavanaugh, rated by many
scouts as the top quarterback
prospect in this year’s crop of
seniors, was not drafted until New
England picked the Panther all-
America in the second round.
Speculation among the scouts
about a knee injury incurred by
Cavanaugh in a touch football

g game which kept him from being

chosen in the first round could
carry a price tag of nearly $100,000.
Randy Reutershan, drafted on

the sixth round by the Steelers"

because of his ability to bolster

e the special teams, was extremely

surprised to receive a call from Tim
Rooney on the draft’s first day.

 

BOB JURY

Brzoza, who had earned all-
America status at two offensive line
positions during his Pitt career,
was hampered by his size (his
weight ﬂuctuates between 210 and
252 depending on who is giving the
information) before ﬁnally being
selected by the Steelers.

There had been speculation as to
whether the Steelers, would go
against the wishes of coach, Chuck

' brothers

Noll and choose a kicker on the first
round, notably «Steve Little of
Arkansas. The St. Louis Cardinals
solved that problem by making
Little the 15th pick of the draft,
some seven choices ahead of
Pittsburgh’s initial opportunity.
The Steelers eventually chose
Craig Colquitt, who finished
second among the nation’s col-
legiate punters last year while
kicking for Johnny Majors at
Tennessee.

Cleveland, Cincinnati and Hous-
ton all strengthened themselves in
a bid to unseat Pittsburgh as the
Central Division’s playoff repre-
sentative. The Browns landed
linebacker Clay Matthews of
Southern California (rated by many
as the top linebacking prospect of
the draft), Alabama receiver Ozzie
Newsome and Johnny Evans from
North Carolina State who will
account for the void created by the
loss of Tom Skladany.

Cincinnati chose Notre Dame
defensive end Ross Browner, and
Ohio State defensive back Ray
Griffin to fortify the Bengal
defense. The reunion of the Griffin:

running back) makes Cincinnati thei

only team in the NFL with a member:
of the same family on both the!
offensive and defensive units.

The Oilers obtained an instant
offense to go with their already
staunch defense by selecting Heis-
man Trophy winner Earl Campbell,
Gifford Neilson, quarterback at
Brigham Young and Texas Chris-
tian receiver Mike Renfro; These

additions, along with Billy “White
Shoes” Johnson and Ken Burrough.
could spell trouble for defenses
that had been accustomed to
Houston’s nonexistant offense.

Roy Gerela will get some token
competition from 10th round choice
Tom Jerich of Northern Arizona
while Colquitt is expected tojsolve
the Steelers’ punting woes for
years to come.

As was the story last year when
Robin Cole proclaimed Jack Tatum
as his idol, this year’s ﬁrst round
pick, Ron Johnson of Eastern
Michigan, also holds the Oakland
free safety in high regard. Not to
be outdone, Colquitt announced
that he would do his best to
emulate his idol, Oakland punter
Ray Guy.

DRAFT DODGES: The Steelers
selection of Reutershan on the sixth
round was the ﬁrst time a Pitt player
was pickedby the home NFL club so
high “since Paul Martha was a first
round pick in 1966...Miami, which
had plans to pick Cavanaugh on the
second round, saw New England
pick him just before the Dolphins
were to select.

NFL Draft A ftemoon ‘Strained’ for Matt Ca vanaugh

Before pro football’s selection meeting commen-
ced in New York Tuesday morning, talent scounts

across the NFL said Pitt all-America quarterback 

Matt Cavanaugh would be an excellent—and
early—choice since his only possible weakness was

that his amazingly accurate throws might not pass

through granite blocks. _ _ . _
At least, that’s what player personnel directors
would tell a reporter. Among themselves, however,

they spent more time considering a far more damning V

-“ mor: Cavanaugh’s leftjkpnee, though ‘never

amaged during an injury—ﬂeckedj;C&reer at Pitt, had p

been hurt to an extent unknown.  ._ p .. ,-
The story was in many ways accurate; Cavanaugh,

- playing touch football at the;Stadium March 22, had
sprained ligaments while rnaking a cut. He was on
crutches for a length of tir_n.e,still undertermined and

made used of a brace in an[attemp.'t to hasten the

healing _  1 . ..  “.  
Cavanaugh and his advisers decided, in what

seemed to be the-proper move at the time, notto ad-' 

vertise his misfortune. The injury was temporary,

" they reasoned, and certainly nothing overwhich to '

, lose any contract money.

But word of the injury leaked and several teams.
became suspicious. It has been widely reported that
Tampa Bay, which considered making Cavanaugh its
top selection, flew a physician to Pittsburgh in an ef-
fort to examine the quarterback who, if healthy), was
the finest available. But Cavanaugh, not wishing to
risk an unfavorable report, would not see the doctor.

Then San Francisco general manager Joe Thomas,
also interested in Cavanaugh as a first-round pick
(the 49ers selected seventh), offered to fly Pitt’s quar-
terback to the West Coast for an examination.

0 Cavanaugh’s agent, Nick Buoniconti told Thomas

he would save the 49ers the trouble and expense of a

' plane trip and physical. _ ‘
“He won-’t be available by the time your pick

comes around,” Buoniconti told the 49ers. .
It was an admirable, though not wholly effective,

screen.
Cavanaugh’s knee traveled from coast to coast,

riding rumors that placed it, as the story swelled, in a
brace, on crutches, in a wheelchair, on an operating

rtable or “in a coffin. The draft began at 10 a.m.

 

Tuesday;ﬂtalk about Cavanaugh’s knee continued
past lunchtime. _.

The. phone "at adviser Joe Massaro’s home rang “
J first at 12:30 p.m.—the Los Angeles Rams wanted to
know about the knee. The Falcons called later with a

similar request for information. The Chiefs ‘held an
extended telephone conversation with Cavanaugh
later and told he would be their choice in the third
round. -Still, however, he was undrafted.

The 23rd call was the one from New England.
Cavanaugh already had heard of his lot by the time
the Patriots contacted him. ‘

And so the knee landed in New England when the

Patriots, looking for trade bait and/ or a backup for r

the immensely popular Steve Grogan, made
Cavanaugh the 50th player chosen.

“The rumors hurt,” admitted Cavanaugh, who
will soon be a wealthy young man and who soon
should be a good pro passer. “They were
exaggerated...they might have cost me a first-round
pick (Tampa took Grambling quarterback Doug
Williams on the 17th pick of the first round), but I’m
not so sure the money difference between the two
rounds is enough to make me worry.

“The knee is at 90 or 95 percent now,” he con-
tinued. “I’ve been having it treated and I’ve been
working out on it some.”

Strained ligaments repond well to treatment and
the damage is temporary.

Cavanaugh’s ability to direct an offense makes

‘

him unlikely to become a patient of the pity ward,
but Tuesday was not less than Christmas, New Year’s

and a birthday combined for several of Cavanaugh’s,

former Panther teammates.

Randy Holloway was the first Pitt player to be,‘

chosen; the Minnesota Vikings, possessors of ‘a front
four so aged that even George Allen would be wary,
picked Holloway during the first round. Holloway
will learn from such players as Carl Eller, Alan Page

and Jim Marshall, then receive an opportunity to

make the best of his abilities.

. Bob Jury, the man who should, have been the?"

Steelers’ first pick, went to Seattle, where he’ll be

part of what would be called a rebuilding process but 1
for the fact Seattle had no defense last year. Jury will‘
lay safety: for the Seahawks, and he should be an ex-

cellent pro.

Elliott Walker, a fine runner, blocker and receiver,

would not “have placed the 49ers high on" his list of
preferred destinations, but he received high marks

from scouts before the (draft ‘and should stickjf.
somewhere in the league. 7 

Also a sixth-round pick was Randy Reutershan,
the special teams star who could also play some
defensive back or receiver for the Steelers. Perhaps
the biggest surprise of Tuesday’s selections, Reuter-
shan, ﬂeet and crazy enough to be a hit in Pittsburgh,
did not believe the Steelers’ Tim Rooney when the
phone call was made to Reutershan Tuesday night.
Believing the caller to be either Cavanaugh or Jury,
Reutershan told Rooney it was a “bad joke.”
It wasn’t a joke, nor was it a bad pick. The Steelers
may have made less painful the error made in
overlooking Jury.

Willie Fry of Notre Dame, the Steelers’ second
choice, was not universally admired. Of Fry, who
spent a decent chunk of his career watching his
fingers slide from Tony Dorsett’s ankles, a Pitt coach
said: “We’ll run at him all afternoon, then we’ll run
at him all night. And, if you give me the chance, I'll
get up early Sunday and run at him then, too.”

Joe Paterno, John Majors and Jackie Sherrill were
among the college coaches who did less than fear Fry.

Kentucky Derby favorite, reminds
Jimmy Jones a lot of another horse
from the Calumet stable he saddled
for a victory 20 years ago.

who with father Ben Jones guided

Calumet’s racing fortunes from
1939 through 1964.

“Tim Tam didn’t slug you out

with a big burst, but he always
found a way to win. I remember he

conclusion he wasn’t lucky. He was
just smart. He was a pro.

“That’s the way I feel about
Alydar. Doesn’t overpower you.
Doesn’t look sensational. He just
gets to the wire ﬁrst.”

Tim Tam won the Derby in 1958,
one of eight thoroughbreds ﬂying
the devil red silks of Calumet to
capture this most prestigious of all
horse races. The first was
Whirlaway back in 1941, the last
was Forward Pass in 1968 when
Dancer’s Image was forced to
forfeit his purse because of the
controversial Butasolidin drug
medication incident. g

Alydar is seeking to break a
10-year Derby drought for the
Calumet empire.

“This is the ﬁnest Derby ﬁeld in
many years,” Jones acknowledged
Wednesday as activity intensiﬁed
around the Churchill Downs barns.
“At least four, maybe more,
top-flight horses, all primed and
ready. Not a hair out of place. All
the trainers conﬁdent.”

Besides Alydar and Afﬁrmed,
who battled for 2-year-old honors in
1977 and dominated the 3-year-old
campaign this spring from opposite
coasts, strong contenders include

Alydar Favored To Win Kentucky Derby

raced only once as a 2-year-old, and
fast-coming Believe It, winner of

the Wood Memorial.
Rounding out the ﬁeld are Chief

of Dixieland, Hoist the Silver, Esops
Foibles, Dr. Valeri, Derby Creek
Road and Raymond Earl, all rated
as outsiders.

Jones said he believes Alydar
inherited his racing ability from his
grandma, Real Delight, and great
Grandma, Blue Delight.

“Both were fantastic mares,” he
said. “I remember Real Delight.
She was crippled with arthritis. I’d
look at her and she’d come out with
steam and somehow manage to win.

“I never knew exactly how. But
she did it. Pure guts, I guess. Blue

Delight was the same way.

Methodical, professional—they are ,

the words for it.”

Ask Jimmy Jones to name the
greatest race horse he ever
saddled—-or saw—-and it’s like
throwing a switch on an electric
scoreboard.

“No question,” he booms,
“Citation. He could do anything
and everything. Other great horses
have had to have certain condi-
tions. Secretariat, for instance,
needed a hard, ﬁrm race track.

“Citation—that horse didn’t give
a damn what he ran on. It could be
railroad tracks as far as he was
concerned. And he could win with
me on his back. There, gentlemen,
was a horse.”

Tampa Bay GetsHolmes;
Noll Terms Deal ‘Bargain’

By The Associated Press

Defensive tackle Ernie Holmes,
whose personal woes got more
newspaper headlines than his able
play, was traded by the Pittsburgh
Steelers yesterday to Tampa Bay
for two low-round draft choices.

“It was a gift,” acknowledged
Steeler coach Chuck Noll. “We’ve
been trying to trade him for a long

time, but there wasn’t much
interest.”
In return for Holmes, the

Steelers got a 10th and an 11th
round pick from Tampa Bay. They
selected placekicker Tom J urich of
Northern Arizona with the tenth
round pick, and used the 11th-
round selection on cornerback Nat
Terry of Florida State.

Noll didn’t mince words when
asked why he had traded Holmes.

“The distractions. We can’t have
another year like last year,” said
Noll. “There’s lots of ways to
eliminate distractions. ’ ’

After the grade announcement,
Noll wished the best to Holmes,
who was a starter when the
Steelers won a pair of Super Bowl
titles.

“Ernie is a lot like Pittsburgh.
He’s much better than his
reputation,” said Noll. “Maybe
this will give him a new lease on
life. He can be an effective
player.”

Holmes, a native of Texas, was
the Steelers’ eighth-round draft
pick in 1971 from Texas Southern.

He was unavailable‘ for
immediate comment on the trade
from his home in Amarillo, Texas.

Holmes’ troubles with his
personal life, the law and ﬁnancial
debts have been well chronicled.

In 1973, he prompted a police
manhunt after he ﬁred several
revolver shots and shotgun blasts
at trucks near Salem, Ohio. During
the manhunt, he also opened ﬁre
on a police helicopter, wounding
the pilot in the ankle, police said.

Holmes initially faced .multiple
federal and state charges because
of the incident. He later pleaded
guilty only to assault with a deadly
weapon.

He was placed on probation after
appsychiatrist testiﬁed at a hearing
that Holmes had suffered from
“acute paranoid psychosis” during
divorce proceedings.

Holmes later underwent
psychiatric care at a hospital in
Pittsburgh and played with the
Steelers the following season.

In January of 1976, Holmes was
arrested in Amarillo for alleged
possession of cocaine. He was
acquitted in a jury trial in early.
1977.

“My head is clear, it won’t be as
heavy as it was last year,” said
Holmes after the trial.

Nonetheless, Holmes reported to
training camp out of shape last
summer. He’s listed at 6 feet 3, 270
pounds, but he reported at over 300
pounds and lost his starting job.

Also hampered by a respiratory
illness last season, Holmes
announced he was quitting the
team one day, but returned to
practice the next.

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Losers of seven of their last eight
games, the Pitt baseball team (9-12)
lost to Cleveland State, 5-4 and 7-1,
in a doubleheader at Trees Field
Monday. I «

Pitt, which also dropped a
doubleheader to West Virginia
Saturday at Trees, travels to Clarion
State today for another double-
header before returning to meet
Penn State in yet another twin bill
Saturday. . ’ n .

’ “We’re not hitting,” Pitt coach
Bobby Lewis said after his team’s
most recent setback. “Our
pitching, at times, has been
adequate, but it seems whenever
we get the good pitching, none of
our hitters hit. We just haven’t
gotten that many breaks this year. ’ ’

The Panthers had several such
breaks during Monday's first game,
but failed to capitalize on many of
them as the Vikings pulled out a 5-4
win in the 15th inning. -

At first, it seemed like Pitt wa
about to take advantage of those
breaks. While starting pitcher
Marc Bianco twice in three innings
retired the side in order, Pitt scored
two runs in the second inning to take
a 2-0 lead. 2 ’

leveland State came up with

_four -runs: in: an error-filled‘ third
inning, however, to take the lead, "

4-2. The Panthers, who committed
three errors in that inning, added
two runs in the sixth to tie the score

and ‘send the game into extra»

innings. .

As far‘ as Lewis was concerned,
though, the fourth inning signalled
the end for his Panthers. To the

Panther coach, that inning was even -

bigger than the 15th, when the

Vikings scored their winning run on

a pair of singles andwalk.
“That’s when they started to hit

start thinking like that, you get into
trouble. We were in trouble after
that inning.”

The inning also marked the
pitching downfall of Bianco, who
left the game in the 13th in favor of
reliever Jim Boyle.

“When they started to hit the ball
in the fourth, that’s when Marc
started to have his problems,”
Lewis explained. “Otherwise he
pitched a strong game for us. He
had some big strikeouts there in
those first few innings.”

Jumping out to an early 4-0 lead
in the second game, Cleveland State
had little trouble holding onto win.
After a four-run first, the Vikings
added a run in the fourth and two in
the fifth to win going away.

Pitt collected only three hits in the
contest, one of which was first
baseman Art Bortnik’s home run in
the third inning.

PITTCHES: Bianco surrendered
12 hits. in the first game while
striking out 12 and walking
four.. .Boyle took both losses. After
relieving Bianco in the first contest,
the sophomore from York, Pa.,
started and w_ent the distance in the
nightcap, giving up 11 hits. . .Four of
the seven runs charged to Boyle in
the second game were unearned...
Pitt committedfour errors in each

game...With the wind blowing in,>

onlyone home run (Bortnik’s)was
hit during the afternoon.. .Pitt had a
chance to tie the first game in its
half of the 15th but catcher Dave-
DiCello popped out with runners on
first and second... E ‘.
Dave Crist and Tony _DiSaia are
expected to start for the Panthers
today at Clarion State...Bianco and
Don Koller will pitch against Penn
State Saturday, while Tim Moran
starts Sunday at Indiana State.
Moran, who at this time last spring
was pitching Peabody High to the

city baseball championship, has
been used exclusively in relief for
the Panthers.
