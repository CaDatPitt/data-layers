Editor of the Carolina

journalisthas also written Carl
Sandburg,-a proﬁle of his inti-
mate friend, and his latest work
is ‘called You’re Entitled!
Literary Efforts
Most
forts, however, are concentrated

on his monthly, .16-page news- '

paper,_, which he writes‘ entirely
by himself. Circulation of the
Israelite has grown from 800 to
almost 20,000 in the relatively few
years. of its existence.

Gdlden. whose topic at ‘Wed-

I feel like writing, I write. I
putit in a barrel, and when I
need copy, I just reach in the
barrel.”

A social critic as well as a hu-
morist, Golden has written on
such subjects as integration, anti-
semitism, juvenile delinquency,
modern livrng and the trials and
pleasures of childhood. ,_,

Some of his “plans” for solv-

SG president Tom Olofson ex-
plained four projects completed
this summer and outlined sug-
gestions for this year’s activities
at the Senate’s ﬁrst meeting of
the trimester on Thursday.

First, Olofson and vice-presi-
d_ent Judy Diethorn sent welcom-
ing letters to all freshmen. En-

or other student organizations.
" 400 out of almost 1000 students

complied.
The letters were sent for two

Secondly, they give us a pool of
talent to draw on in the future

First Time — Success

“This is the ﬁrst time for this
project and it was quite a suc-
cess. We intend to follow up these
cards.”

The freshmen outing, organiz-
ed by Ruthie Maguire, was “the
finest yet,” Olofson commented.
700 to 800 freshmen attended.
.Thirdly, Olofson went on, the

Book Exchange, headed by Ber-
nice Kimmel, averaged $300 -an
hour on the‘ ﬁrst day, something
“unheard of in theppast.” In four

Polaris Selling

The fourth project, the Polaris,
Olofson
stated, with “the sales going real
well.”

Olofson concluded, “We went
into four areas and all did well.
And there were only three or
four people here doing work.
Now with 30 here, let’s see what
we can do. SG is running in
high gear and as far as I’m con-
cerned, we’re just starting."

Spontaneous Cheering
The cheering and exhortations
were spontaneous — every time
the director dropped his arm.
There were many last second cues
but the response was sincere.
The fraternities had standard
bearers posted everywhere and
looked as formidable as a Rom-
an legion — only the symbols
on the standards were Greek.
And CBS—TV beamed the mes-

Student Employment
Gets Many Applicants

.Milich Finds Part-time Jobs for Students;
(Sends Letters to Many University Members

By JACKI KATZ

As a result of the efforts

of Eugene Milich, supervisor

of the student employment office at the University, there
are now more jobs available to students than had been ex-

pected.
Milich obtained these jobs

by sending letters to Univer-

sity deans, directors, department heads, and faculty. “If you

have a need for part-time student¢
employment during the 1962 Fall
Trimester, please contact the Stu-
dent Employment Ofﬁce at exten-
ion 306,” the letter stated.

“Our jobs are not strictly in
the University,” Millich stated.
“We get many calls from places
of. business in all parts of Pitts-
burgh. For these jobs we try to
place communters who live in the
vicinity and would not have to
spend part of their pay for car-
fare.”

Few ‘Turned Down

“There are very few jobs which
our office will turn -down,” he
continued. “We will only turn
down a job if we feel it would
be detrimental to the character
of the student or would harm him
physically. There are very few
other cases we will refuse to ac-
cept a job.”

Many students wanting a
part-time Job for this term have
flocked to the office of student
employment for help.

Since the end of August, Millich
has interviewed more than 200
His

ﬁlled for the next few days with
the names of more people that
want his help in ﬁnding jobs.

Already Placed Many

Milich’s office has already placed
many students. Pay on these jobs
vary. Some offer only one dollar
an hour while others are for $1.50
or more.

From September 1961 to Au-
gust 1962, student employment
had approximately 1800 appli-
cants. This year in less than
one month over 200 have ap-
plied. Acording to Millich,
“Applications slow down after
October and then pick up again
in January. This year's appli-
cants are about the same num-
ber as last year.” .

Many of the stores in the neigh
borhood hire permanent help only.
However some stores, such as The
University Shop, Crandall-Mac-
kenzie Cleaners, and Yohe’s Drug-
store hire several part-time work-
ers.

The drugstore will have four
students working part time by
this week. According to George
Yohe, the owner, “We have had
students working for us every
year. _We used to use them for
the fountain which we took out
last year. Now they work in other
capacities, mainly salespeople. It
works out very well for us.”

Amid the usual sea of cynical smiles, the University's
Student Government Senators held their first meeting of

-- the trimester last week.

The organization appeared to be determined to shatter

' _ the disrespect of the student body —— and to do it as quickly

as possible.
SG President Tom Olofson, who was described as being

"‘genuinely enthusiastic” at the meeting, set the toneby
‘describing what he considered the major accorrrplishments

of the organization during the summer.
He successfully showed that the freshman welcoming
letters and outing had been well appreciated by the new-

. comers. He followed this with a report indicating that the
" Book Exchange was now more popular than ever and that

the Polaris handbook was almost a sell-out,

Olofson knew, however, that merely parading past suc-
cesses would hardly be enough to win any degree of stu-
dent regard. Therefore, an , impressive and ambitious
agenda for the year was also discussed at the initial meet-
mg. * '

The weighty list includes_"plans for Parents’ Weekend,
Homecoming and Winter Weekend, support for the United
Fund, and promises to look into a check-cashing service, a
program for foreign students and the greatly needed stu-
dent directory. .

SG promises are well known on campus. Promises are

the only thing which has allowed SG to remain at the Uni-
versity during the past few years of stagnant Senators and
ludicrous leadership. Even the promises have begun to
loss their "appeal, as indicated in the poor election turnout
last year.

Now trying to forget that its abolishment was serious-

ly considered, even voted upon, last year, SG is indeed
wavering on shaky soil. This is one of the reasons for its
last ditch, go-for-broke agenda. '-

The proposals, although some not altogether new, do
appear to have been thoughtfully patterned "with the stu-
dent in mind. To have them all materialize within our stu-
dent life-times is almost too much to hope for, but it is felt
that the student body is increasingly feelingthe need for
such programs. ' V '

The need and desire exist among the students. All they

Education ~

By Anita Ciuil<o

['

The latest victory in the battle of the non-con-
formists against the teaching of religion in public
schools has been the recent Supreme Court ‘decision
declaring the New York State School Prayer
unconstitutional. ' v

‘As a result of this déeisin,
which will probably have far-
reaching consequences, no prayer
may be recited in the New York
schools. Will this lead to. an in-
crease in New York’s already-
high rate of‘ juvenile delin-
quency? Will New York stu-
dents become Communists, as '
predicted? I seriously doubt it.
New York students will probably
act just as they always did,
worrying more about their status in the street
gangs and little, if at all, about Eternal Damna-

 

' tion.

In the other forty-nine states, the effects will
not be, noticable for some time. Parents will sign
with relief that the decisionwas not made about
their state, and their children, atleast, will not
become Communists or vandals, because they are
still allowed to chant a prayer each morning.‘

Parents Will Protest

Certain brave parents, however, will bring the
matter of school prayers to the courts in the other
states. They will consider school prayers, recited
in publicly supported school buildings, by public-
school children, supervised by publicly—paid teach-
ers, as a state—supported form of worship. Believ-
ing in Constitutional separation of church and state,
they will object. ‘

But, as- in New York, the debate will rage vio-
lently. Moralists will argue that some children do
not receive religious instruction in home,‘ so they
must get it in schooljotherwise they will grow up

the Land of the Free.

to be immoral. But observant parents- will think
it highly doubtful that.listening to the Bible and
chanting ‘a “non-“sectarian” prayer is going to

make anyone more pious, moral, or even good; 

hasn't done much so far, as juvenile delinquency
has been on the increase, even in New York when
the prayers were recited. -

commendations for this year.
“The Senate should take part in
these projects. We will set time
limits and get done what has to
be done eﬁiciently. Last spring I
promised Dr. Rankin to set up a
United Fund. I want to senators
to take out a week, look over the
matter thoroughly, and come back
and tell us how. to set it up__. I want
them to take a responsible foot-
hold.” Dave Menzer and Steve
Patz volunteered for the project.

The second suggestion’ was
putting out a student directory.
“Everyone- agrees we should
have one. Again two people
could investigate it and ﬁgure
out how to do it.” Ben Cardin
and Steve Gershman volunteer-
ed. '

Thirdly, Olofson brought up the

winter weekend Pete ,Bijur‘ had

_,,/;ﬁ»<suggested last winter in Gavel

Club. Joe Seiger, Al Malasky, and ’

Bette Guttenberg will investigate
the possibilities.
Recommended Program

Fourthly, Olofson recommend-
ed a program for foreign students.
“No other group is big enough or
influential enough to do anything
to help. We need two senators for
a*few we_eks to read literature,

—look into past "committee work,



#5.”:

‘F

and talk to people.” Sue Goldmier
and Nancy Roland were chosen.‘
Finally, Joyce Ruey will look
into a check-cashing service in
the Book Store.‘

Olofson reported that the tri-
mester committee report will come
out as scheduled at the end of the
ﬁrst trimester. “As for ID cards,
it’s the same as with the student

directory. We should have them’

and yet~‘no one has done them.

V _ Can Work Them Out

“SG can do all of these things
if we work hard. We’_ll always find
difficulties or else these things
would be here. This is the group
that can work them out.”

SG was asked to march in the
academic procession for the
Honors Convocation in order to
have representatives from the
“total "University community,”
stated advisor Bernard Adams.
The Senate agreed.

Jackie Hersh was elected chap-
lain in Elayne Darrell’s absence.
Don Hamilton was graduated this
summer also, leaving two vacan-
cies in the number of representa-
tives from Liberal Arts. The senate
possessing the power to elect new
members, was asked topbring any
interested’ candidates to SG.

Dave Stoller reported on the
present standing of "the Polaris.

ed, _but pre-registration sales went
so well that it was raised to 2,200.

. After the ﬁrst day 1,000 had been

The faculty has brought 251
books and the parents of fresh-
men 330 books. Stoller reported
that they sent out letters to the

1 75 Anniversary

By SUSANNE ECKMAN

There is a signiﬁcent rela-

tion between interests, and

NQPA in a given ﬁeld, reports
V ‘ a University psychologist, Dr.

Ann Martin.
~ She described her research

-“to develop a reﬁned academic
interest measure for the ‘Strong

Vocational Interest Blank’ that
would have a useful relation to
QPA” at a recent meeting of the
American Psychological Associa-

6 tion.

Also, according to her ﬁndings,

engineering and mines students
_ have “little concern .

. for ac-
tivities of a social nature involv-
ing verbal communication.” They

are more concerned with material
goals.

Prefer Languages

ﬂect a concern for people, often
taking a liking to odd and pecu-
liar people. They prefer activi-
ties of a social nature dealing with

language. Liberal arts males tend
;_to seem unconcerned about ma-
terialistic evidence of success and

are more interested in creative ac-
tivities.

_ Dr. Martin began initial re-
search on this subject after be-
coming interested
of “non-intellectual factors of
success,” working under Dr.
Glazer of the Testing Services
and Measurements Laboratory.
' Following the freshman classes
of '59 and ’60, she did comparisons
of the relations between scores
on scholastic aptitude tests and
high school rank, interest‘ test

‘scores, and actual QPA’s.

Freshman Tests Used
This study of "personality, in-
terests, and occupational choice”

6 uses the Strong Vocational Blank
-that every freshman ﬁlls out as

part of a battery of tests. The

-4 form tests for similarities between

students’ interests and those of
successful people in various ﬁelds.
There are 45 keys for grading the
form, each for a different ﬁeld,
and students are given a grade in
each one.
Until now the main use of
the tests has been in counsel-
ing. If a student is capable,
but undecided about his courses
the results may indicate a pos-
sible direction. No attempt has
ever been made to use the form
to predict sucess or failure.
According to Dr. Martin, col-
lege boards and high school grades
are useful in helping to predict
succes in college, but they are
often very inaccurate. The seem-
ing impossibility of improving the
predictive power of this kind of
test points to the importance of
other factors.

Difference Correlated
In the study QPA’s were pre-
dicted for students on the basis
-of this kind of test. Then the dif-
ference between this QPA and

-the one actually obtained was cor-
‘related with results from, the in-

terest tests. Her ﬁndings have in-
dicated a signiﬁcant relation be-
tween interests and QPA.

Dr. Martin did the initial
work herself, with the cooper-
ation of the psychology depart-
ment, computing center, policy
and planning department, and

office of student records. She
hopes that a grant may help
her to continue further in her
investigations.

In the imediate future she will
follow the ’61 freshman class to
check her conclusions further.
Later, she would like to extend
the research to other coleges, such
as Penn State, and to high schools.

She is a native 'of,Pittsburgh
who attended Allegheny High
School. The mother of- three
children, she started college here
when her youngest child entered
grade school. She went straight
through, and received her,PhD
this year.

Until last year the doctor was

Obviously some little time has passed
since I last, was offered a byline in a college
‘newspaper. Nonetheless, despite the chang-
.7ed'~'c'ircu'mstances, I feel quite at home on
these pages by reason of two aspects of my
assignment for this anniversary edition. I
~ .'One aspect is that you and I have been
.-“part of the same brisk academic mobiliza-
"tion on this campus; and the second is that
so, many of your own editorials about it,
however critical at times, have shown an
"earnest concern that we keep unerringly at
your announced goal.

I That goal, as you know, is to provide
both the human and the physical resources
for a university education equal to the ﬁnest
in the country.
No Mean Achievement
As institutions go, 175 years of continuous
existence is no mean achievement. Such
{staying power says a great i
deal, I think, about this Uni- A
ersity’s contributions to the
region which has supported
it since before the days of
,George Washington’s presi-
«dency.
*_ _,A great many students
of one or two generations
ago will be visiting us this
week; I expect you will see
them up at our already
 ‘famous circular dormitor-
has and our rather remark-
I: able book center.
‘ ._None of them, of course,
will remember Professor
*:Samuel Pierpont.Langley and
his pioneer aircraft as any-
thing but a Pitt legend —— one
_of;those dramatic pages from our history in
which alumni rightly take pleasure.
But many will personally recallthe dis-
covery of Vitamin C and the Salk Vaccine
in our laboratories; and the classmates who
went on to become state supreme court
‘justices and college presidents, authors and
ambassadors, and Nobel Prize winners,
sprinkling Pitt names in the “Who’s Who”
-listings of numerous distinguished callings.
No doubt some of you who were on
campus last year will in later years recall
the history-making synthesis of ACTH as
.v a proud Pitt achievement.

raises is not so much one of past glories but

of accomplishments yet to come. What kind

of staying power have we for the future?

As you consider this inevitable question,
I encourage you to measure‘ our worth
against the changed responsibilities which

modern life thrusts on you as students and.

on us as a university.

Bear in mind that every profession,
having undergone much sophisticated
development, is short of adequately edu-I
cated personnel. Realize that as new dis-
ciplines are born and as research unlocks
more of the secrets of the universe, of life,
and of human behavior, there is more you
must learn as students.

And recall if you will that there is per-
haps a greater need — indeed a hunger -
for competent, enlightened leadership in the
world than has ever been the-case before.

That is why I believe it is no longer
enough for a university ‘to
be good; our responsibilities
dictate that we turn our

sights on greatness.

The changes we have
witnessed "on this campus
in recent years address
themselves to that aspira-

We have acquired our

fessions, Clapp and Langley
for the natural sciences, the
Student Union, our dormitor-

the physical education center.

We are now adding the
Van de Graft nuclear accelerator, the Henry
Clay Frick Fine Arts Building, ‘and our much
needed Hillman Memorial Library.

I need not catalog everything here nor
dwell on the delightful prospect that we
shall soon have a campus in the most tra-
ditional and peaceful sense of the word,
an environment -for necessary contempla-
tion. 

But the truer test of our mettle is, I
think, in our curriculum, our faculty, and
perhaps most of all our students. _I should
not care to have physical improvements
overshadow these changes.

That we now have a Graduate School of

graystone mausoleum. I turned
my attention towarr’. it and dis-
covered that it was the resting
place of Percival Lowell, found-
er of the elevated observatory.

The gate of the tomb faced the
far valley, and behind it I could
see Lowell’s lonely casket. The
sunlight ﬁltered
through the colored glass dome
of the ’mausoleum cast a fright-
ingly cold, sterile’ light on the
metallic icofﬁn. The contrast of
the utter void inside the tomb
with the activity of nature with-
out was striking. A

which was

What Sort of Man?
Wondering what sOrt_ of man
this Percival Lowell was, I no-

ticed some words chiseled by the
side of the gate. It was a quota-
tion from one 01‘ the "scientist's
books:

“ . .V . To see into the beyond

requires purity, and the sector-
ing it makes (the astronomer)
perforce ‘a hermit from his
kind . . . he must abandon

cities and forego plains .l . .
only in peace reased above and

aloof’ from men can he‘ pro- ‘

ﬁtably pers-ue his search." In.
common with most explorers, he
will encounter upon his re-
turn that final penalty of pene-
trating — the certainty at first

of being" disbelieved.”

Well, that told me a little bit

about Mr. Lowell, 1855-1916.. But
the dust in that casket bothered

me. Was Lowell right? Must one
“abandon cities and forego plains”
in order to be a successful ex-
plorer in life‘? As I walked around

the grounds of the observatory‘

trying to feel what Lowell must

have felt there, I pondered the
question. I

In, fact,.I have pondered the
question for these past few
weeks. And I have ﬁnally de-
cided that for all of Lowell’s
genius and dedication, he was
dead wrong in his view. of the
“explorer,” the creative -human
being.

FOr‘I have this mad vision of

The..University now educates‘

students from 'all points of the

in " providing proper atmosphere
for those" students remains to be
answered. I shall endeavor. to do
so’ in this article, along with sug-
gestions on how to alleviate some
of the problems which the proper

"officials could use.

 Ibelieve that the foreign stu-

dents and the administration
could work together to , bring
about an atmosphere at the Uni-
versity more conducive ‘both for
themselves and for the ones to
follow. '

Few Employ
I, am told that the University

tions of higher learning in this
country that employ a full time
foreign student advisor. Yet, with
the personal contact I have had
with that office, I ﬁnd a need for
more personnel to eﬁiciently dis-
charge the duties assigned to it.

eign student advisor, has but

students at various levels of stu-

  Iﬁdies and in all departments. In

addition there aregnumerous peo-

.ple on the faculty from abroad.

sum up the situation here at the
University.

\ No Second Look

A university bulletin states that
there are students from all over
the world so that a girl in a sari
no longer gets a second look from
the students. The statement no

doubt‘ was meant. to illustrate the,

acceptance of a foreign student on
campus as commonplace.

Instead, it is a milestone in
student apathy toward foreign
students, as in other matters.
It is true that no foreign student
gets a second look from his fel-
low student. In fact, he is "left

alone completely. Many are
completely lost on the large
campus, and ﬁnd themselves

lonely and at a loss to turn for
help to anyone.

Although most fraternities on

-the campus have no clause about

admitting only white Christians,
the members seem to have an un-
derstanding about ‘not admitting

Negroes, Jews or foreign students
of other faiths.

few non-sectarian fraternities,
which he may not feel inclined to
do. As a result he is excluded
from experiencing the fr'aterni'ty
life, which -he does not have in
his own country. I

In desperation they go to the
foreign student ofﬁce after a
"few weeks and through them
get in touch with other students
from their country. They form
their own “group” and set up a
small “colony.” Thus they de-
feat one of the purposes of com-
ing abroad to study — to know
and learn more about America
and their way of life.

In a recent program for the
Voice of Amercia
Litchﬁeld is said to have said that
both he and Mrs. Litchﬁeld -have
extensively travelled abroad and
are most- interested in meeting
and discussing problems the for-
eign students have at the Uni-
versity.

Beneﬁt Many

He continued by saying that the
foreign students beneﬁt not only
themselves and their country by
gaining technical education in

them, Americans gain a better in-
sight into the affairs of the coun-

The American students do not
seem to hold the same opinion
on the subject as the Chancellor.
To me it seems that it is up to
the University oﬁicials to stim-
ulate the interest among ‘the
American students.

It would, for example, give

prestige and show the Chancellor's

personal interest among the for-
eign students were he to ﬁnd time

foreign student advisor.

Reception Possible

As for meeting the foreign stu-
dents, the Chancellor and Mrs.
Litchﬁeld could possibly hold a

reception for the foreign students _

where the students could have an
opportunity to talk and meet not
only student organization leaders,
but faculty’ members as well, some
of whom they may never meet
again during the academic year.

Dr. Litchﬁeld’s participation
in the activities of the foreign
students may in turn serve as
a catalyst in inducing the stu-
dent body in general to take a
more active interest in the for-
eign students.

Membersof the faculty and ad-
ministration could perhaps be bet-

'ter oriented in coping with pro-

b 1 e m s of the foreign students.
This -would take some of the pres-
sure from Miss Lichtenstein.‘Also,
it would be more efficient than
the present system where the for-

eign student tells her his difficul-

ties —- while she, in turn, has to
help the person-in—char-ge make
a decision.

 Any narration of my experi-

It is this omni-everyplace

Illusion Sewn

The university illusion was
sown into my consciousness in a
more than inpropitious manner.
I was cornered in some far cor-
ner of a department store by an
elderly lady acquaintance who
had recently visited Penn State
and was eager to tell all and sun-
dry (particularily prospec-
tive Penn State freshmen such
as myself) of. the many beauties
she had beheld there.

“It’s beautiful,” she said, "I
just can't begin to -tell you.” But
she was able to after all, so I
listened, -I wearily remembering
the politeness tenets included in
my upbringing, for a half hour
or so, while she explained in a
particularly palling creamsauce
Southern accent.

But in spite of the tedium, my

imagination’s discerning ear was_

able to catch hold of one phrase,
a phrase that I believe with grow-
ing conviction has never really
left me.

By TOM OLOFSON

As we celebrate our 175th
Anniversary, it becomes ever
more apparent that our Uni-
versity has grown and ex-
panded a great deal since the
erection of a lone log cabin
in 1787. Throughout the many
years since that lone struc-
ture was built, and under the
guiding hands of scores of ad-
p ministrators and community
.; leaders, the University has
prospered along the paths of
both intellectual and archi-
tectural growth.

  However, even with the

 presence of one of the wOrld’s
largest educational structures,
the giant 42-story Cathedral
of Learning, and even after
decades of continuous growth
of some sort, Pitt was merely
a large university in and in-
dustrial center which was

./C concerned with so many other
activities that to many in the
academic world, this institu-
tion nearly bordered on ob-
scurity.

"By this time a new civic
renaissance gripped the na-
 tion’s steel .center and pro-
 _ .3/jects of all types designed to
» -- 2*? remove much stagnation
found in the city were under-
way.

   

It is at this point that a

 

A senior majoring in industrial ' '

management, Tom Olofson is the
president of the student govern-
ment. He took ojﬁce after an at-
tempt to disolve the student gov-
ernment by the preceding presi-
dent, Richard Sabota, had failed.

Olofson has done away with a

 

lot of red tape and SG now has 

new vitality unde-r his leadership.  

In the article, Olofson urges both i 

the student body and the adminis-
tration to work together and help
make the University one of the
ﬁnest educational institutes in the
world.

number of these civic leaders,
possessed fortunately with a
good deal of foresight, decided
to launch a plan. that. would
mold this university, which
at that time bordered on
mediocracy, into what they
hoped someday would truely
be one of the nation’s, if not
wOrld’s, ﬁnest academic insti-
tutions.
, Pitt Renaissance

Thus, Pitt is presently in
the midst of it’s own renaiss-
ance, one which has only been
in existence for about four
per cent of the school’s total
life. Within that short period
though, we have witnessed an
array of occurrences, probab-
ly only matched in the entire

In The End

In the end, it is the education you receive
here which will tell both you and me how
well we are succeeding in our manysided
undertaking.

I should like to take this moment to
tell you that in many ways I am proud of
you -- both as students and as human‘
beings. I believe it has meant something
to many of you to be going to college with

students not only from other states but
from other continents and cultures.

I am impressed with your ability to work
hard — your combined Quality PointvAver-

climb. I am pleased that so many of you
who were ‘in the top fifth of your high
school classes have chosen to go ‘to college

And I am delighted «with. the convictions
and interest in politics, ‘the arts, jandesocial

Indeed, you are helping to breathe a live-)

this not only .a sign that we are making
progress but also an inspiration for carrying
on.

the Mid—Day series, I hope they
schedule some of the foreign
artists for the P.M. Series.

SUB organized an Interna-
tional Dance during the United
-Nations Week. I hope that they
arrange ,more "dances of this
type. Such dances can be in the
format of the last year’s dance,
where some of _the foreign stu-
dents teach easy dance steps of
their country and others pro-
vide variety entertainment typi-
fying the culture of their coun-
tries. I

Perhaps simple dishes of other

countries can be included -in the.

refreshments. These innovations

‘would spotlight ‘the existence and"
importance of the foreign stu—.

dents on the ‘campus. It would be
a good idea to have some of the

’ foreign students on the SUB com-
’ mittee to help advise and plan

the activities.
I Unknown Forum

The. Olﬁce of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange seems to hold

Foreign Forums in one of their

seminar _rooms. I think very few
students, including myself, know
much about them. Perhaps the
SUB can arrange such informal
get-togethers where American and

foreign students can exchange

ideas. Meetings held under its’

auspices that receive proper pub-
licity could prove to be popular.

The Film Series seems to in-
clude only American movies or
those from the countries which
are the latest “fad.” These mov-
ies can be seen at the local
I theaters, by those interested.
There are good movies made in

 =. other parts of the world which
 ; have .not become popular in this

country, and are. thus not shown
commercially.

I am told that movies from
these areas are available in the
catalogues: perhaps it is not too
late to include some of them in

‘ next term’s program.

Column Series
I had suggested -to the editor of
The"Pitt News last fall to run
fcolumns written by foreign stu-

dents, which I, with the help of

Miss Lichtenstein and her as-
sistant, was able to collect and
submit. I hope they gave some in-
sight to the readers about the
students who wrote them.

Perhaps this year. we can do
the same and the students will

write in their comments about
the contents of the columns.

Another student from India,
Vasanth Kumar Bhat, later began

‘a series of interviews with the

foreign students on the college
radio station, WPGH: “Pitt Ex-
plores the World.” The series will
be continued this year on Mon-
days and Saturdays at 8:30 pm

Radio Effort

As the stationlcan be picked up
only by the dormitory students in
the quadrangle, and has to com-
pete with the commercial’ stations
as well, I do not know how many
students’ avail themselves of the
opportunity but'I hope that the
effort in I this ﬁeld is proving
beneﬁcial. 4 H I

An article by Christian Herter,

former Jsecretai-yof State, which .
appeared in This Wéek maga-
zine during the summer, dis-
cussed the usefulness of “For-
eign Aid in Reverse.” ‘

Mr. Herter felt that every un-
der-developed country had some
thing of value to contribute to the
Western civilization. I heartily
agree with the premise. Here at
the University it is evident by the
increasing number of foreigners
on the faculty.

Language No Barrier.
Contrary to common belief, even
among the faculty members, the
foreign student at the University
does not have academic difﬁculties

‘due to his lack of knowledge of

the language, for after the foreign
student oﬂice screens the appli-
cants no such problem arises," for-
eign students ﬁnds problems due
to the fact that the teaching sys-
tem here is quite different from
that in the other parts of, the
world.

Thus, it would be of helpto
the foreign student with such
problems and the foreign stu-
dent advisor if the professors
had some idea of the teaching
system in the area from which
the foreign students come.

Several faculty members and
deans of the schools, as, well as
the Chancellor, ' are travelling
abroad to study the education sys-
tems there. I am sure these visits_
will prove beneﬁcial not only to
the persons who make the trips,

but to their colleagues and staff. V

as well.

Arrival of Chancellor
The arrival ‘of Chancellor

Edward H. Litchﬁeld and the
rise in academic excellency
here, however, have cast a
different light on this theo-
rem.

The transition today is
not so drastic. There are
football players here now
who the Us-and-God Ivies‘
have considered while do-
in g “enrollment work.”
Pitt unhypocritically calls
it “recruiting.”

But such has not been the

case here before the dynamic
Dr. Litchﬁeld appeared. In
1937 muckraker Upton Sin-
clair found more things in
shambles than the Chicago
slaughterhouses.

“Pitt is the ‘only college in
the country,” Sinclair wrote,
“that gives a high school
diploma.”

1958 when a football play-

They didn’t want a boy who
knew a lot about the split-T
and nothing about a T-square.

Sane Policy

The sane athletic policy is
not unique to Pitt alone. The
increased weight of academic
endeavor has f o r c e d all
schools to change their ways.

The pressure to ﬁnd
qualiﬁed boys to play‘ foot-
ball has inspired an entire-
ly new approach to re-
cruiting. The modus oper-
andi, according to Coach
_John Michelosen goes like
this: '

“One, we become interested
in a boy. Two, we go to the

 

principal’s oﬁice at his high
school and check his grades.
Three, we talk to his family
and his coach, to determine
what kind of boy he really is.
Fourth, and ﬁnally, we deter-
mine his football ability.”

Logical Series

It took nearly 175 years to
found this logical series.

As Coach Murray Warmath
of the University of Minne-
sota has concluded: “It seems
there’s a strong tendency to

The Oratory of St. Philip Neri

To speak of Philip Neri as the founder of the oratory is to misinterpert the role he played in introducing a new
community into the life of the church. ' -

We might say more correctly that the Oratorian Way of Life rather blossomed from Philip’s personality as the
flower from the nine. Philip (1515-1595) was born, reared and died in a century rife with gigantic plans and counterplans
for the reformation and of regimentitation of spirituality. Philip could easily have jumped on the bandwagon. But Philip
Neri was a humanist. He saw in the inﬁnite variety of personalities a real power, a power that could be cultivated for the
good of the person and the church. - - .

Accordingly, he directed all who came into contact with him with almost a preoccupation for developingeach one’s
spiritual and intellectual talent —- but always with an eye to the common good. He nudged his diciples along by gentle pre-
suasion and his own good example, content to urge rather than force. This spirit and way of life, conﬁned by the early fath-
er of the Oratory and blessed by the church is the Vade Meium of every Oratorian.

In brief the Oratory is a community of priests and brothers not bound by vows or any tie whatsoever, but united
by a common active charity which urges each one to work for the progress of the kingdom of God in the individual and in
the world at large. » A » ' 4 0

This way of life has ﬂourished, especially in Italy, until the Secularization of the church in the last century, and
now it is again on the upswing. —

Germany, France, and Spain have all witnessed this way of life. /

Cardinal Newman, at the time of the ‘Second Spring’ of Catholicism in England introduced the Oratory in his na-
tive land. Newman, with his characteristics depth of insight and broad outlook envisioned establishing on the campus of
his beloved Oxford, a center to foster this Oratorian attitude towards life. This, Newman’s fondest dream he was never
able to realize, but others have. t _

‘ Last year, His Excellency, Bishop Wright of Pittsburgh took the initiative towards realizing Newman’s dream, also,
here in Pittsburgh. On May 26, 1961, he began the founding of the Oratory of St. Philip whose principle work would be the
forstering and developing of a true Christian Culture via the work of the fathers of. the Oratory with the university stu«-
dents. The fathers will dedicate most of their time to this mo st congenial and fruitful apostolate work through the Newman

 

Center realizing the Spirit of St. Philip and the dream of Cardinal Newman here in Pittsburgh.

Christmas Mass over NBC Radio), and the host-
ing of the annual National Newman Club Federa-
tion Convention held recently at the Penn Shera-

ton Hotel.

This year’s Pitt Newman Club is headed by

t" son, in his ﬁrst year
ental’school last year,

The business of securing’ a
4 II a ﬁde college football
‘'1 er has become ‘so com-
, ated that some coaches
ow -feel much safer feeding
he data into an IBM machine
d" trusting the statistics of
bability to provide the
lit, grade-A recruit.

:Last year, for instance,
-only seven of the 52 Penn-
sylvania high school all-
tar’-football players who
articipated in the Big» 33
game qualiﬁed for entrance
or-.Pitt. Of this number the
Panthers acquired three of
;those eligible——quite a _good
centage, but still ,many
Tihe»' ballplayers , couldn’t be
touched. '

And . the scrutiny has re-
iduced the drop-out rate con-
Iderably. The 1960-61 frosh
 as an example, did not
e: one player in the first
-ear by dismissal or with-
rawal.

 Standards No Higher
While the standards are no;

   

 

higher than those demanded

by some schools, they are cer-
tainly_higher than most col-
lege "football powerhouses -
and this has materially con-
tributed to lessening the num-
ber- of outstanding football
players who can get in.

Thereare still a few snap
courses at Pitt but few
football players are taking
them. ‘At the present mo-

ment the 102 students here '

who play football here
fall in this academic line-
up:

Ten are in business admini-
stration; ten are in education;
13 are in engineering; three
are in dental ‘school. ,

Six in Pre-Ed

Six are in pre-education,
nine in Ipre-med, 20 in pre-
dental, three in pre-business.
And still ‘there are Q.P.A.’s
on the roster that read thusly:
3.14, 3.31, 3.06, 3.32 and 2.91.”

There are many whose [col-
lege board scores totaled over
1100 and a few topped the
1200' margin. ’

The average Q.P.A. of
the "group enlisted in 1960-
61 was 2.38. It is a better»
rating than that recorded
by students involved _in six
other sports here -which
had boys on scholarship-

rthText

 

aid and only the baseball
players had a better mark
v— 2.647. But _that was. for,
only three recruits. compar-
ed to 33 yearling‘ gridders.

Yet-there is no typical play-

er. Theboys are rich and .
poor, neat and sloppy, large‘

and small, ‘quick and slow.
Some are campus leaders and
belong to a half dozen clubs;
others are quiet and retiring.

Devote More’
Academically, they devote

more time to football than "

they should; their grades suf-

._fer and they must hustle to

take up the slack each spring.
Some are married, s o In e

single; some work, some don’t.‘

Each has had an "opportu-
nity to develop his skills and
poise; whether he is abrain

or just a student who strug-_

gles to get by, he has at least
been challenged to think.

We are losing our some-
what unsavory reputation as
a football factory, but we are

also losing games while try-

ing to erase the sad face.‘

IN 1898, the entire junior class at
the,University was suspended for
smearing glue and turkey feath-
ers on. classroom walls and tying
a teacher’s gradebook "to an iron
bar‘ and sinking it in the Alle-
gheny River. The students were
permited to return to classes only
after paying a $15 ﬁne.

(Continued from Page 9)
echelon ﬁnancing and the
erection of modern build-
ings are many, the creation
of a challenging and stimu-
lating academic environ-
ment is perhaps a more
difficult process as there
-are no mechanical proce-
dures that may be followed.

There ‘appears to be too
much intangibility involved
here to allow. one to .simply
apply" a mechanical course of
action.

Institution Moulded

I ' think this is the area
where both the ‘student and
the faculty -member may,
through the recognizing" of
this responsibility followed
by a decision_accepting this
responsibility-, contribute a
very vital part to the mould-
ing of an institution that has
not only a most beautiful

-campus, but at the same time

is possessed-of an air of in-

   

   S»  Prospers

tellectual curiosity and the

desire to learn. V

As pointed out previous-
ly, the activities surround-
T ing our anniversary cause
one to think that Pitt is
developing a proper aca-
demic environment just as
it is constructing architec-
turally attractive buildings.
Likewise, just as there are
many more structures to
erect before our physical
expansion is complete,
there is "much to be done
yet academically.

While We employ some of
t h e f in e s t administrative
minds to create a ﬁne univer-

sity, let all of those taking .3

advantage of these new op-
portunities a l s o contribute
their part and take up their
role in the hopes that the
Chancellor’s prediction of Pitt
emerging as
world’s greatest institutions"
becomes an eventual reality.

Alas, Plywood Doors

Must I say implicitly that my

of falls that’ rendered me be-

of all the king’s horses‘ and men?
The panelled walls, the Satanic
panelled walls that had propi-
gated ,a one basket way of life
for me, turned out to be huge
plywood closet doors in a tooth-
paste-textured room that dashed
my fumed oak fantasies into a
thousand decorator colors.

With the fall of the Master
Illusion,’ collapse of its spurious
offspring quickly followed. For
the remainder of my stay at
State, I suffered from a racking '
case of reverse illusionism,
wherein the word college now
brought forth all. manner of
sordid images: coldwater show-
ers in rabbit-warren boarding
houses, aboriginal waitresses in
an ever-ﬁlthier assortment of
egg crematoria, and an aware- .
ness of a quiet class war being
waged between a hedonistic.up-
per class and a ‘tatterdemalion

painfully aware. of belonging.

the facilities, the pool will be
available to only students and
faculty members.

Students will have to dis-
play’ their invoices to gain
admissionfto the swimming
pool proper. Faculty mem-

, bers will also have to show
. some sort of, identiﬁcation.

Students_that enjoy the pool
can be thankful that Carver’s
predecessor as athletic di-
rector, Tom Hamilton, had the
foresight to begin pushing for
the new pool astfar back as
1953.

None Since 1951
Pitt had been without a
pool since 1951 when the Uni-
land
which had housed, its swim-.
ming pool to the government
so that the present Veterans’
Hospital could be erected.
Before I-lamilton’s depar-
ture, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
took over the head post of’
the University and joined
Captain Tom’s efforts to
obtain the new pool.
According to Carver,
“Chancellor. Litchﬁeld, w as
110% behind the new pool
and was mainly instrumental
in having the building com-
pleted by this date.”'
Reactivate Tourney
Carver also plans to reac-

tivate the Pitt Interscholastic
Swimming Tournament
which they held from 1913
until the close ofthe old pool.
The Tournament will bring
together the top high school
swimming talent in the West-
erniPennsylvania area. 9

Present: plans do not in-
clude any state wide high
school tournaments obut

‘ Carver has let the people in '

charge know that the new
pool would be receptive to’
holding the Pennsylvania
High School championships.
Nor would Pitt turn its
head at a chance of having an
NCAA - swimming 1 meet -- in
their outstanding pool.

No matter what the pur-»
pose of the pool may be, it is.

certain that John C. Trees
Hall willbe a worthy addition
to the Pitt campus.

 

THE UNIVERSITY was one of
the large colleges ir the’ United
States to institute aftwo-week
summer school program. '

CO-EDUCATION was introduced
at the University in 189: when a
chemistry professor, Francis Phil-
lips, requested that the admin-

istration permit women _to enroll

in his science courses.

IN 1842, teachers at the Univer-
sity received mere token salaries.
Pay consisted of a’, $50 ‘per year
guarantee and “a small stipend
to each professor from the lim-
ited resources” of the University.

' A;TALEtUNIv.El3sITr committee -

has recommended -that the Fresh-
man class be housed with upper-
classmen instead of being treated
as a separate unit on a separate
campus.

THE FIRST senior prom at the
University was held in 1901—after
six, co-‘-eds ‘taught male students
‘how to dance; ‘ '

administrators concerned students
who climbed a fence surrounding
a near-by jail—yard ta watch pub-
lic hangings. /

IN, 1796, trustees of the Univer-
sity established tuition rates for
each student studying languages
at $16.80 a year, $14 for writing
and math majors, and $8 for stu-

IN 1870, the most serious disci- dents merely leaning how to read.

Ijlook forward to seei-ngi youlat both the’ gala and the f I

scholarly events which, this week, will co111111.ein'orate

the UniVersity’s 175 th anniversary and the Constitutioifs.
Like all celebrations, this one will have its fun and

ANOTHER_ YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR

With toda.y’s _entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns
in your school newspaper for the 1nake1‘s of Marlboro Cigarettes.
Nine years, Iibelievc you will agree, is a long time. In fact,

it took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez

Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was!

To be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the

shovel been invented at that time, but, as we all know, the
shovel was not invented until 1946 by Walter R. Shovel of
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel’s discovery in 1946, all
digging was done with sugar tongs-—a method unquestionably
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu-
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Shovel’s
brea.kthrough——notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell intoa ﬁt of melancholy
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered
him up by imitating a duck for four and a, half hours. A ‘

But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this
column for the makers of Marlboro" Cigarettes, and for nine
years they have been paying me money. Yome shocked. You
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro’s unparalleled,
ﬂavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s ﬁlter, who has revelled in
Ma.rlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box Should be more than
willing to write about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa-
tion. You are wrong. ‘ .

Compensation is the very foundation Stone of the America
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For exainple, I
have a friend named Rex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up
and say, “Hey, Rex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex,

let’s go ﬂatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,” and he '

will always reply, “No, thanks. I [better stay here in case
somebody wants aldog wormed.” I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm-
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other-
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of
democracy.

It’s the same with me and Marlboro Cigarettes. I think
Ma.rlboro’s ﬂavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist’s

‘It Goes On ..."

 

 

MA, THE MATADOR

,Getting enthused about a football team here is akin to
getting excited every time a girl’s shoulder strap dangles
over'the slope of her arm.

But getting ecstatic about Miami’s George Mira is like
seeing ‘—‘The Naked Maja” step out of the canvas and throw
a kiss in your direction.

For Mira is the toughest, most talented quarterback in
the country.

The six foot, one inch,
180-pounder has the rare
ability to pass effectively
while rolling out to his left
as well as to the right. Be-
cause of sheer physical
strength he can throwvac-
curately from awkward
positions, and he also has
the poise to wait for a
second man to break free if
the ﬁrst ‘receiver ‘is cover-
ed.

Mira says Johnny Unitas,
the Baltimore Colt pro great
who tutored him this ‘spring,

me how to get back into the
pocket quicker,” Mira said,
“and hé told me never toglook
in the same place where
you’re _ going to throw.”

Bit Fingernails _ ‘

Mira ‘was extremely. ner-
vous before the game. He
stalked the dressing room.
He was constantly.biting his
fingernails, and snapping at
anyone. He was nerveless
running the team. 7

"and poised as the famed
- -bullfighter, Manolette, "who
G'°°"99 Mir“ delighted Hemingway so
much years ago. Of Spanish descent, Mira certainly fits
the role and he looked at times as if he had tossed his
cape over the heads of the Panthers.
He threw bullet passes overhead, side-arm and even
under—handed. (Last year he threw a TD pass left-handed

— against Florida.)

He" completed 13 of the 25 passes he threw for 162 yards
and a touchdown and carried the ball ten times for 86 yards.
His total -yardage of 248
for a single game.
Special Mitt Needed ' ‘ '

He did all this despite the pre-game skepticismthat the
loss of All American’End Bill Miller and End ‘Larry Wilson
would be fatal. Few-thought the replacements could hold
Mira’s, pitch. . , , ‘ '

They talk about his pitch_ as if he were knuckle-baller
Hoyt Wilhelm. “Yes, we lost two great ends,” Mira said.
“But-I had great conﬁdence in the ends this year from the
first day of spring practice.” .

A gay Andy Gustafson still found fault. “We should’ve

[had more completions,” the coach said. “They dropped about

six passes of George’s_ which they should’ve caught. But it’s
still early and I knew we’d drop a few. ‘

“Mira has the a-rrogance of the great ones and a better

’ arm than any boy I’ve ever coached,” Gustafson said. “He

still makes mistakes and he still has to learn to use his
blockers better, but I’ve never seen‘ a kid like him.

“He’s fast getting back into the pocket, he has quick
hands and ‘feet, and’ he has remarkable peripheral ‘vision.
Some people say he throws too hard. But a coach can spend
a lifetime and never ﬁnd a boy who can throw like George.”

And there were few fans at‘ the Stadium who doubted
that. Mira got bounced good a few times, staggered once “and
punched a few times,” but the durable Miamian rolled with
the blows and tossed some lethal counter punches of his own
-— deep in Panther territory. ;; '

At Florida’s Key, West High School Mira was. so good
as a pitcher that he had a $20,000 bonus offer fromthe Balti-
more Orioles and so good a football player that he could

. rarely pass. (“Our ends couldn’t hold the ball,” hesays, “so I

ran,mos,t of, the time.”)  "

He was as quick,‘ graceful V

Alumni Tires;
Booters Settle
F or 2-2 Tie .

By FRED MARCUS
The varsity soccerman re-
covered from a two-goal de-
ﬁcit to tie the alumni, 2-2, at

Kennard Field Friday night.

VBob‘ Murdoch scored the ﬁrst

alumni goal when he powered a
deﬁected shot off a varsity play-
er into the goal. Simon. Pestich
looped i_n the second goal over
goalie Tom Staab’s outstretched
hands late in the ﬁrst quarter. .
The alumni showed spurts of
former greatness: Ron Wyatt,
with skillful dribbling; goalie Ron
Goga, with several stops and
longvdistance kicks; Tom Young,
with aggressive defensive play;

‘and . Pestich, ‘ with » -breakaway

runs toward the goal nets.
Varsity Revived
"The varsity tallied in the sec-
ond quarter when Sam Dona-
telli zeroed in a shot. Then Bruno
Schwartz deadlocked the issue.
“The lights gave the players
some trouble,” Coach Leo Be-
mis said. The ball was hard to
see, especially because the
grounds were muddy from rain
- earlier in the week. At one time‘
a player on the bench lost
sight of it.

“The players did a good job
under the circumstances,” Bemis
added, “and the alumni, especially
their defense, provided a good

shake-down for the varsity.”

Quarterback
Leads Team

To 23-14 Win

By_ BOB SMIZIK

“It. was the great move-
ments of my ends in getting
themselves loose,” George
Mira said. Frank Lauterbur

called it “a collapse of the

defense.” Glen Lehner" said,
“It was all_Mira’s doing. He's
great.”

Lehner, the Panther’s safety-
man, hitthe focal point in.ex-
plaining Miami’s crushing , 23-14
win Saturday at the Stadium.

Mir a completely. dominated

. play. Yet the All—American quar-

terback, who could pass for a
waterboy, refused to take more
than a‘ small-part for his team’s
success.

Credits End

“My ends were great,” he said.
“Their movements were so good
that plenty of times there wasn't
a defender near them.”

“Their receivers were not out-
standing by any means,” Lehner
differed._“Except (Nick) Spinelli,
who was real fast and did a good
job.” v

“Mira was the man who made
the offense go,” Lehner added.
“Our strategy was to stop his
long passes and we did by play-
ingdeep. But heset to throw so‘
fast "that" our linebackers
couldn’t get back fast enough
to stop the short passes.”

Mira agreed here. “I noticed
they were playing deep, so quite
often the -hook point was wide
open,” he said.

Blames Everybody

Lauterbur, the defensive coach,
wouldn’t pinpoint the reason.
“Every part of the defense relies
on the other,” he said. “You can’t
blame any partfor today’s show-
ing.” .

The game marked the’ debut of
the Head Hunters. The coaches
e x p r e s s e d contrasting feelings
about the new defensive units.
Coach John ' Michelosen said,

“They did a good job in the ﬁrst
—h'alf,‘but just couldn’t hold them
_in the second half.” Lauterbur

said, “The Head Hunters were
not up [to theirbest.”

If -the Head Hunters were not,
Mira was. He led the Hurricanes
on a 97-yard scoring march for
the ﬁrst TD, of which he personal-
ly contributed 47 yards.

Leeson Overhauled

It was this drive that seemed to
squelch the Panthers. Before it,
they had been stopped on their
own three. Fullback Rick Leeson,

  

AFTER — Paul Martha couldn’t-‘
hold onto this pass and a Panther
long-bomb threat was squelched.

of the afternoon.‘ 1

team, ran 45 yards before he was
surprisingly hauled down from be-
hind. In four tries the Miami ‘line
held.
The Panthers made it close
for awhile as they scored near,
the end of the half. Paul
_Martha hit Al Grigalinuas with
a nine-yard scoring heave to
end a 59-yard drive, making the.
score, 10-6. ‘

But Miami only gave the ball
up for three plays in the third
quarter, had to~~punt for the ﬁrst
time in the ball game with four
minutes 1eft‘in the third quarter,
and Mira got even hotter. \ ,

Miami not only had the Band of "
the Hour, they had the Man of

The cross-country team, coached

One of the unsung members of the Panther offensive
line this season is a junior from Johnstown, Ed Adamchik.
Little is heard of Adamchik because the Panthers have an

into the starting right tackle spot
after veteran Bob Guzik was in-
jured.

“Ed is a tremendous offensive
blocker," said Coach John Michel-
osen. “Gary and he should give
us our best pair of tackles in a
number of years. I like the way
Ed worked in pre-season drills.

He also had a good spring p1.act_ career to recommend him for
ice_ Thereys no reason why he college. He played for an out-
‘ standing Johnstown High team

shouldn't have two good years a-
head of him.”

No Injuries

Adamchik feels confident the
Panthers will be tough this fall.
“This team isn’t as deep in talent
as many of our opponents,” he
said, “but we have been fortun-
ate so far in fall camp not to be
hit by injuries.

“Last year,” he continued,
“we were hurting with key men
sidelined before the first game.
We have two good solid teams

‘ potential they have, that hope may
I become a reality thl-‘L year.

this season, but we are still not
as deep as some of the squads
we meet. That's a big difference. _
But I feel as long as we have
just our share of injuries and no
more, we will have a good
team.”

Adamchik had a fine high school

that won the WPIAL title in 1958.

Playing-on the other side of the
line from Ed that championship
game was a behemouth tacke from
Clairton named Kaltenbach. “We
often talk about that game, and I
always give Gary the business,”
Adamchik said. “Now we ‘both
hope we can play on a great team
together.”

They have Bruno
Schwarz, a 21-year-old junior who
comes from Germany.

“I was actually born in Poland
in a section that was then a part
of Germany,” he said. “We lived
on a big farm‘ there until , one
night we received a 24-hour evac-
uation notice which said a big
battle was to be fought in the
area. Leaving everything behind,
we all fortunately escaped.”

Bruno’s father, however, - re-
mained a prisoner-of-war until
1948. “We heard a lot about the
United States from relatives here.
The opportunity to‘ come to
America occurred in 1951. Since
then I have been more than satis-
ﬁed _with life here.”

' Loves Game

When he was in Germany,
Bruno played soccer constantly;
but the time from 1951-61 saw
him playing very infrequently.
“Soccer is a fascinating game that
I love,” says the 5’-10", 150-

Bruno. formerly went to
school at Johnstown College.
“Then I decided to write to
Coach (Leo) Bemis at Pitt. I
told him I was interested in
soccer. He helped to get me into
Pitt and said I could receive a
scholarship; however, I had to

 prove myself on the team.’

This he did. without too much
trouble. Winning a starting.posi-
tion at inside left by the fourth
game, he ended up playing every
‘quarter but one.

At Pitt, Bruno is majoring in
German with an eye toward
teaching it in college or going into
government work. He also has an
