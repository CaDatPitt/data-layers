Business
students
maximize
potential

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

The smell of money was in
the air as the University of
Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz
Graduate School of Business’
Small Business Development
Center presented a seminar on
maximizing potential as an en-
trepreneur last night in the
William Pitt Union's Kurtzman
Room.

The program, sponsored by
Alpha Kappa Psi and Delta
Sigma Pi business fraternities,
was aimed at undergraduate
students and featured two
well-established entrepreneur
keynote speakers, Michael
Fortino and Cynthia lannarelli.

’’I’m excited to see other

people interested in en-
trepreneurship,” said lan-
narelli.

lannarelli, named the 1987
Western Pennsylvania Young
Entrepreneur of the Year by
the Small Business Administra-
tion and a Pitt MBA advised
young entrepreneurs to ”think
big, but start small."

Fortino, President of Fortino
and Associates, spoke on time
management, networking and
amused the audience with his
advice on the technicalities
and importance of business

Michael Fortino addressed business students on being an
entrepreneur as well as a good dresser.

etiquette.

”Women should never let
their slips show, and men
should not let their socks
droop down," said Fortino as
he offered advice on etiquette.
He also said, ”Plan your day,”
and, ”build balance into your
life.”

Fortino also stressed the im-
portance of compiling a list of
contacts.

Lynn Berardi, a Pitt business
major, commented that Forti-
no instilled in her a feeling of
motivation. She also said that
”he was very energetic."

Three people have declared
themselves candidates for the
position of Black Action Soci-
ety chairperson, although no
one has submitted his or her
name for the job of deputy
chairperson. Applications are
due in the BAS office by
5 p.m. today.

BAS positions to be

According to Monique Sims,
the present BAS chairperson,
Rodney Howerton, Cartrell
Wright and Shawn Williams
are the only people who have
picked up election packets.

The elections, which are
scheduled to take place on
March 1, are open to all mem-
bers of the BAS. There will be
a ”Meet the Candidates” night
next week which will be car-

voted on

ried live on WPTS, Pitt's radio
station.

The BAS elections commit-
tee has reorganized after
problems surfaced over the
legitimacy of 147 votes. To en-
sure that no such problems oc-
cur this year, Sandra Saunders
has been put in charge of a
revamped elections com-
mittee.

Greeks want MTV
for dance marathon

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor

This year’s’ Greek Week chair-
men want Pitt students to (lance
on television. That's why they’ve
been calling MTV in an attempt
to get the all-music station to
cover the dance marathon in
March.

”We’ve contacted MTV on
numerous occasions. [We feel
we're having difficulty eliciting a
response because] it's [the dance
marathon] during [most schools’]
spring break. We haven't gotten
a definite no; we haven't gotten
a definite yes,” said Lee Brody,
co—chairman.

‘ 

We really want to
create an atmosphere
of Oakland community

— Robin Hunn

Brody and co-chairman Rol)in
Hunn said they are seeking head-
line bands. ”You have to have a
good band to get MTV, but, on
the other hand, you have to get
MTV to get the good bands," said
Brody.

The 24-hour marathon is
scheduled for March 18 to 19.
Although the event has been held
in Soldier's and Sailor's Hall for
the past three years, this year, the
committee said it was informed
that due to the structure of the fa-
cility, it would not be able to ac-
comodate the anticipated crowd
of 450-500. At present, the mara-
thon is scheduled to be held in
the William Pitt Union assembly
room. ”We’re working on getting
the Syria Mosque,” said Brody.

This will be the first year the
dance marathon will be open to
all student organizations, not just
Greeks, as it has traditionally
been. Hunn said this is a point
she would like to stress.

”That’s my big thing. I'd like to
encourage [all student organiza-
tions] to dance and have a good
time with us,” said Hunn. ”|t's a
good recruiting tool. It shows uni-
ty among the groups that we can

work for each other."

Disc Jockeys Jimmy and Steve
of WMYG will be the honorary
chairmen and, according to Bro-
dy, have been plugging the dance
marathon on their radio program.
In addition, flyers will be dis-
tributed, and posters will be
placed all over campus.

”We really want to create an at-
mosphere of Oakland communi-
ty,” said Hunn. Brody said he
received a good response from
the Representative Student Coun-
cil, an organization comprised of
student leaders, when he pro-
posed that the dance be opened
to all Pitt students.

”Also, Pitt isn't really known
for one event, and that's what
we're trying to do," said Hunn.

There will be many prizes
given away after the marathon,
including two round—trip tickets
to Miami via U.S. Air. A
35-millimeter camera, Penguin
tickets and two year—round meal
tickets to Roy Rogers are among
the smaller prizes to be awarded.

”We want to make sure every-
one goes away with something,”
said Brody.

In order to be eligible for the
larger prizes, non-Greeks will
have to pay the same admission
fee as Greeks, which is $100 per
person. However, to be eligible
for the smaller prizes, an entrance
fee of $25 will be accepted.

All money collected will
benefit the Western Pennsylvania
School for Blind Children. Greek
Week participants are hoping to
raise $75,000 through the efforts
of the events they are holding
during Greek Week.

The school, located at 201 N.
Bellefield Ave. in Oakland, needs
an estimated $9 million for reno-
vation. Last year, Pitt Greeks
raised $72,000 for the Harmar-
ville Rehabilitation Institute.

This year’s theme is ”Lighting
the Way”. The following events
are scheduled: Blood Drive,
March 21-24; Chariot Race,
March 21; Greek Olympiad
March 22; Greek Gorge, March
23; Greek God/Goddess, March
24; Greek Sing, March 25; Greek
Week Mixer, March 26; and the
Greek Formal, April 8.

Student Government Board supports GALA in EOS

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board last night passed formal
resolutions urging the university
to include sexual orientation as
part of the university's Equal Op-
portunity Statement and to ex-
pand the space alloted for

computer labs.

The Board resolved to draft a
letter requesting that university
President Wesley Posvar include
sexual orientation in the EOS. If
approved by Posvar, it will be
officially forbidden by the univer-
sity to discriminate on the basis
of sexual ‘orientation.

Joel Rapoport, co-chairperson

of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance,
said GALA has been trying since
October to gain the SGB’s
support.

”They have been extremely
cautious, and’ while we would
rather have had them move more
quickly, we understand their
need for caution,” he said.

Rapoport said the SGB support

is symbolically valuable in that
the Board recognized GALA’s
persistence. T

”This gives the other commit-
tees and boards, [through which]
this resolution is going to have to
pass, the message that they can't
just ignore us and think we're go-
ing to go away,” Rapoport said.

The Board also formally draft-

ed a petition demanding that
more space be allotted for com-
puter labs on campus.

The petition, signed by all
members of the Board and the
president, reads in part, ”... the
undergraduate students strongly
urge the Executive Vice President
and Provost to obtain more space

Waldheim refuses to resign despite his Nazi past

VII NNA, Austria President
Kurt Waldheim Monday defied
widespread calls to resign he-

vowed not to retreat hetore

Ilis decision, announced in a

when a historian’s report ques-

the Balkans.

”Thus it is no longer a matter

Waldheim ruled out resigna-

New Hampshire

holds no surprises

Ah, the glories of New Hampshire in the lengthening days
of February. Today, voters are gathering at the shrines of
democracy to let their choices be known for a victim to take
over the helm after the Reagan debacle has run its course.

When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary
for the people of one great state to assist in the choosing of
a leader, they had best beware. The waters of politics are deep,
and the fish bite hard. Just last week, Paul Simon was waging
a brutal campaign of character defamation against Richard
Gephardt, and the fur is still flying over the profane remarks
a Gephardt campaign aide made about the Core camp.

In short, the scene is not one of gentlemanly politics. The
stakes, which include the future of the Kemp campaign, are
high. New Hampshire has become, along with Iowa, the test-
ing ground for national campaign tactics. It is a place to watch
a good fight up close.

To our minds, it is also a good place to watch the true colors
of the candidates emerge.

There are, of course, some interesting positions being taken
in the meeting halls of New Hampshire. Gephardt has proposed
a national sales tax to help ease the deficit, Simon has accused
Cephardt of harboring a secret desire to raise taxes, and Ge-
orge Bush, after months of hedging around, is trying to paint
himself a Reagan loyalist in the debates.

It looks asthough the Republican vote will go to Dole, and
the Democratic party has been virtually decided in favor of
Dukakis. Whatever the outcome of the New Hampshire vote,
one thing remains clear: the names and faces may change, but

the song remains depressingly consistent.

Avoiding the proper issues

This letter is in response to your
editorial which was placed in The
Pitt News on Thursday, Feb. I I.

First of all, you claimed that the
time it took me to install the sug-
gestion boxes was too long.
However, you failed to recount
the history of the implementation
of suggestion boxes. It has been
documented that the idea of in-
stalling suggestion boxes has
been proposed by Student
Government Boards in the past.
However, it wasn't until I took on
the project that it came to com-
pletion. So as you can see, it is
not how long the project took
that is important, but instead the
fact that it was effectively accom-
phshed.

Secondly, I feel that your
editorials should be utilized to
present issues relevant to the stu-
dents’ best interests. For instance,
why isn't the issue of racism con-
fronted in an intelligent manor
[sic] with serious incites [sic] from
various students? Also, student
apathy is a major problem facing

LETTERS

Pitt's campus. What is your
editorial staff doing to influence
students in taking an active role
in university activities? These are
real concerns that need to be ad-
dressed.

Finally, it is important for all of
us to realize that in order for SCB
and other governance groups to
complete important tasks, a time
limit can not [sic] be placed on
them; for we know not what ob-

stacles we will face. It really dis-
courages me to see that The Pitt
News editorial is not serving as
an accurate communication
source between the SGB and the
students. That is to say that print-
ing editorials such as the one that
appears in Thursday's Pitt News
serve no conceivable function to
the student body; instead, it
diverts the students’ attention
away from real problems that
face them on Pitt's campus.

SEND A LETTER
TO THE EDITOR

HAVE AN ISSUE YOII’ D LIKE TO DISCUSS?

Why not submit an editorial column to THE PITT NEWS. Why?
Because your opinion counts.

Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Cheerios or Raisin Bran?

Don't talk to Elaine Baxter
about six packs and dwarfs and
lackluster candidates. The Iowa
secretary of state prefers her own
think-positive theory: ”The
problem is the candidates are so
good, we're having trouble mak-
ing up our minds. I run into peo-
ple who say, ‘I'll decide at the
debate’ and then come out and
say, ‘I can't decide.’ ”

A somewhat less cheerleading
version of the same "theory is
presented by a Des Moines law-
yer: ”We don't hate any of them,
and we don't love any of them.”

This is how it is in the last days
of the Democratic campaign.
There have been 27 debates and
endless speeches. The voters here
have been tracked by pollsters
like tagged animals on a reserva-
tion. But the people of Iowa
aren't emanating such sure sig-
nals of direction.

The most intriguing numbers
being crunched daily, even hour-
ly, are the ones that feature the
Fickle Factor. As least 12 percent

.mp-

are still undecided. More to the
point, half of those who support
one of the three at the front of the
pack — Simon, Gephardt and
Dukakis — tell the Iowa poll that
they ”might” yet change their
minds. After years of courtship,
well over half the people have
kept their options at least a bit
ajar.

Credit this, if you choose, to the
high quality of the candidates.
Credit it to the traveling pack. But
credit it also to the resistance of
consumers faced with too many
choices.

The problem isn't that the can-
didates present a six or seven
pack. After all, you can pick a
pack up in one hand. The
problem is that they present six
or seven brands. All nicely pack-
aged, all well-advertised.

To turn down a different aisle
of this consumer metaphor,
presidential politics in Iowa is
like going to the supermarket for
cereal. In place of an old stand-
by, you are offered an entire row

 

 

ELL
GOODMAN

of new options. One boasts fiber,
the other vitamins, a third
calcium.

The informed consumer is sup-
posed to comparison-shop
through this row, to read each list
of ingredients thoroughly — to
know the cost and calories, the
FDA daily allowance of vitamins
A through D. Multiply this
process by all the products, and
you can spend bewildered days
in the marketplace, without ever

knowing what the stuff tastes like
when you buy it.

The Democrats who come out
for primaries regard several of
their candidates as better for the
country than the Frosted Flakes
on the other side of the aisle. But
in the primary season, they are
being asked to simultaneously
compare seven men on a dozen
criteria — from Central America
to charisma, from the budget
deficit to electibility.

It's an impossible task. And that
may be what's made Iowans un-
easy, slow to commit. As Baxter
expressed it: ”There is a real feel-
ing here of wanting to make ’the
right’ decision.”

Iowans are conscious of their
role as test shoppers, the early
screeners. The ”waiting for Cuo-
mo" syndrome that has plagued
the Democratic party, the vague
longing for another candidate,
isn't really a wish for more can-
didates. It is the lingering for a
shortcut, someone who would
shine straight through, saving us
from making so many decisions.

Whatever they think about lo-

wans and their caucuses, Demo-'

crats in the rest of the country
want to have the list cut. At the
very least, they want what the
Republicans have, two picks and
a long-shot.

Today in New Hampshire, one-
third of the voters are undecided.
The super Tuesday crowd in the
South is barely paying attention.
It is assumed — indeed hoped —
that some of the candidates won't
make it to their hometown shelf.
A presidential campaign is not
really like a shopping trip — if
you pick the wrong cereal, after
all, you don't have to eat it for
four years.

The new and reformed primary
system has produced a season
that's wide-open and colorful.
But what the voters really want is
to cut down on the number of
brand names.

Thursday's Pitt News editorial,
which criticized Rich's produc-

The editorial in question criti-
cized Rich for the amount of time
she has taken to complete
projects. Rich defended her per-
formance as a Board member in
a letter, which is printed in the
”Perspective” section of today's
Pitt News.

Mark Collins, who identified
himself as a member of the Black

The floor was opened to any
students wishing to comment.
Rapoport said while the editorial
may have been ”a little too nega-

and any publicity should be
regarded as positive.

”A student who might not have
been aware of the SCB who read
the editorial is now more likely

Lady Panthers lose third straight contest

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

After a short-lived winning

1 lstreak, The Pitt Lady Panthers

basketball team has fallen upon
hard times, losing three consecu-
tive games to drop their record to
10-13, 2-10 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers were on a
roll in late January and early
February, racking up wins against
Seton Hall, Cleveland State,
Providence and Robert Morris be-
fore losing 75-67 in overtime to
Boston College at Fitzgerald Field
House on Feb. 6.

In the past week, Pitt lost 86-50
to Syracuse and 80-54 to Connec-
ticut, both road games.

”We’re not looking to shoot
enough. We just need everybody
to be a threat,” Lady Panther
head coach Kirk Bruce said about
his team's lack of offensive
output.

Pitt trailed Syracuse 46-14 at
halftime and Connecticut 39-24
at the half.

Bruce does not believe that
teams are doing anything differ-
ent defensively to shut down his
squad. ”We’re just stopping our-
selves. It’s not the defense of the
other teams,” Bruce said.

A return to the field house may
be just what the struggling Lady
Panther squad needs to get back
on the winning track.

They'll have their chance Wed-
nesday night when the Geor-
getown Hoyas visit Pitt in an
important conference contest for
both teams.

”|t's going to be a tough
game,” Bruce said. ”[Geor-
getown] just beat Seton Hall, and
Seton Hall has a lot of good
talent.”

Georgetown has already
defeated Pitt once this season,
69-64 at Georgetown.

Pitt is in last place in the Big
East, and a win would catapult
them into eighth place. Should
Pitt finish seventh or better, they
would be guaranteed a spot in
the first night of the Big East Tour-

Men's gymnastics sp

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
hosted two meets this weekend
at Trees Hall, facing James Madi-
son on Saturday and Temple on

Sunday.
On Saturday, the Panthers
defeated James Madison

253.6-212.5. Head coach Frank
D’Amico said, ’’I’m real pleased
because I wasn't expecting this
score. I'm real happy with the
guys.”

In the individual events,Steve
Powanda scored 9.3 on the floor
exercise, Chris O’Loughlin 8.85
and Jorge Gonzalez 8.75. The top
Panthers on the pommel horse

were Gonzalez, David Hassel-
brook and Don Bullard.

On the rings, Gonzalez scored
9.0, Dan Tarosky scored 8.95
and Powanda 8.6

Pitt's top vaulters were Gonza-
lez with 9.3, Powanda with 9.15
and Hasselbrook and Keith
Barsky each with 8.75. The top
gymnasts on the parallel bars
were Gonzalez, who received
9.1, Pat Pollaci and Powanda,
who both received 9.0.

On the high bar, Gonzalez and
Pollaci were first for Pitt, each
scoring 8.8, with Hasselbrook
right behind with 8.55.

’’I thought the scoring was
tough but consistent. Our last
three events were very good,”

said D’Amico.

Gonzalez was the top individ-
ual all—around performer, scoring
a personal best of 53.9.

”Basically, it was a pretty good
meet. We stayed together as a
team,” said Bullard.

’’It was a good meet as far as
our scores go,” added Gonzalez.

On Sunday, the Panthers faced
tough competition in Temple and
were defeated 273.15—261.5, but
managed to score their highest
team total in three years.

D’Amico said, ’’I’m as happy as
I can be even though we lost to
Temple. The high point is
definitely our great score. The
guys are coming out of the pock-
et and staying together as a team.

nament, which will be held
March 3-6 at the field house.

The eighth and ninth place
finishers have no such guarantee,
as they play each other in a sin-
gle elimination game prior to the
tournament to determine who
will face the No. 1 seeded team
in the league.

Bruce realizes the importance
of the four remaining games.
”We’ve got to win the next three
games, we gotta win them,”
Bruce said.

Pitt's remaining games are at St.
John's and Seton Hall and at
home against Villanova on Feb.
27 in the final game of the

season.

Friars’ searching for
respectability as they
prepare for Panthers

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

When Providence head coach
Rick Pitino left the Friars last sea-
son to fulfill his dream of coach-
ing in the NBA, people thought
his loss alone would hurt the
basketball program.

Not quite.

The Friars, who last year made
it to the NCAA Final Four, lost
four key starters: guard Billy
Donovan, forwards David Kipfer
and Ernie ”Pop” Lewis, and
center Jacek Duda.

First-year coach Gordon Chie-
sa has inherited a very inex-
perienced team. The only starter
from last year's squad that still re-
mains is senior guard Delray
Brooks. He has the responsibili-
ty of leading the team, a team that
has only four seniors, two of
whom start.

Brooks is the leading scorer for
Providence (10-12 overall, 4-7 in
the Big East), pouring in 13.7
points per game.

Forward Steve Wright, the
other starting senior, is second on
the team in scoring (12 ppg) and
the leading rehounder, pulling
down six boards a game.

Freshman guard Eric Murdock
has proved to be a pleasant sur-
prise this season, scoring 11.1
ppg and is the team leader in as-

The low point is that I still have
three all-arounders out.

"We had a lot of good perfor-
mances today. Pat had his best
day ever, and Jorge did real well.
David did a fine job, and Chris is
coming along nicely. Todd [Pro-
beck] got a great score on pom-
mel horse, and Danny had his
highest ring score for this season.
The whole team is looking
good,” added D’Amico.

Top performances on the floor
exercise came from Powanda
who scored 9.4, Pollaci who
scored 9.2 and Barsky who
scored 9.05. On the pommel
horse, the top Panthers were
Gonzalez with 9.45 and Probeck
and Hasselbrook who both

sists with 71 (through 22 games),
one more than sophomore guard
Carlton Screen, who has 70.

In comparison, the Panthers’
Sean Miller has 109 assists in 20
games. Darelle Porter has 45 and
Jason Matthews has 37.

Sophomore forward Darryl
Wright, who was Pitino’s first
recruit at Providence is the fourth
Friar in double figures, scoring
10.9 points a game and is second
in rebounding (4.4).

Perhaps one of the biggest dis-
appointments for the Friars this
season has been the play of
6-foot-10 sophomore Abdul
Shamsid—Deen. The forward is
averaging only four points and
three rebounds per contest.
Shamsid-Deen began playing
basketball as a high school
junior, so he still has some learn-
ing to do.

Another problem that has
plagued Providence was the
departure of another 6-foot-10
forward, sophomore Marty
Conlon.

Conlon left the team just prior
to the Providence-Georgetown
game on Jan. 13. it was never
made public why_ he left, but it is
helieved he wasn't receiving
enough playing time.

Providence is currently tied for
sixth in the conference with Se-

scored 8.25.

The top Panthers on the rings
were Gonzalez with 9.4, Pollaci
with 9.15 and Tarosky with 9.1.
Top vaulters for Pitt were Gonza-
lez with 9.2, Pollaci with 9.15
and Hasselbrook with 8.95. On
the parallel bars, Pollaci scored
9.2, Powanda scored 9.15 and
Gonzalez scored 8.9.

The top scores on the high bar
came from Pollaci (8.9), Hassel-
brook (8.85) and Powanda (8.25).

Two all-around competitors
from Pitt finished with personal
bests. Gonzalez scored a 54.05
and Pollaci finished with a 53.65.

”This was exciting because we
surpassed our own expectations.

The Pitt men's track team
turned in another strong per-
formance Saturday at the
Cornhusker Invitational held at
the University of Nebraska.

Leading the way for the Pan-
thers were Eric Cannon, Dave
Moore and the 44400 relay
team which, in the process of
winning their races, set meet

and fieldhouse records.

Eric Cannon set his record in
the 55-meter hurdles, record-
ing a time of 7.29. Finishing in
third place with a time of 7.49
was freshman Elbert Ellis. Ge-
orge Ifill finished fourth in a
time of 7.54.

Dave Moore finished the
800-meter run in 1:50.59,
good enough for a first place
finish as well as an entry in the
record book. Moore missed

qualifying for the NCAA
championships by .09 in the
event.

The third record was set by
the 44400 relay team. The
team of Elbert Ellis, Rowan
Mighty, Chop Burton and
Dave Price was clocked in a
time of 3:12.30.

Tom Boggan finished fourth
in the I000-meter run. He
finished in a time of 2:28.25.

The Pitt women's volleyball

Three Lady Panthers have been
selected for the Northeast
Regional team by the American
Volleyball Coaches Association.

Named to the team were
seniors Louise O’Shaughnessy,
Lisa Stewart and junior Denise
Frawley. They each made strong
contributions to a 37-6 Pitt team
considered among the best in
school history.

ing. She played the setter position
for the Lady Panthers — a posi-
tion she had never played prior
to her junior season.

Pitt coach Shelton Collier is
justifiably proud of his captain. ’’I
am the most proud of Louise. She
is the most team-oriented of any
player I have ever coached, in-
cluding collegiate, professional
and national teams.

”For her in her senior year to
get the kind of awards she has
received [All Big-East, All North-
east Region] is very rewarding for
me. It is just a great way for
Louise to go out, and I am very
happy for her,” observed a
pleased Collier.

Stewart finished her career in
much the same way she started
it after transfering to Pitt from the
University of Tennessee at the
conclusion of her freshman year.
She has been All Big-East the last
three years, All Northeast Region
the last two, as well as having
participated in the inaugural
Yugo East-West All-Star Volley-
ball Classic this year.

succeed was crucial to her suc-
cess at Pitt.

wanted her transfer to work out,"
said Collier.

Fraw|ey’s being chosen for the
team was no surprise to Pitt
volleyball fans. Last year, she was
selected All Big-East as well as All
Northeast Region. This year, she
earned the two accolades again.

Collier is hoping that the
honors will be able to motivate
Frawley to heights that no Pitt
volleyball player has attained in
the past. ”Denise’s selection to
the team will establish her as one
of the potentially best players in
the country.”

”When I first recruited her, I
felt she had the potential to be the
best Pitt player ever. Next year,
she will have an opportunity to
prove she is the best player ever
at Pitt,” commented Collier.

States has yet to win a medal.

AMERICANS

The best American finish was
by Frank Masley of Newark, Del.,
12th in the men's singles Iuge.

SKIING

Pirmin Zurbriggen won the
men's downhill, the premier Al-
pine event. Swiss teammate Peter
Mueller was denied a gold medal
for the third straight Olympics,
settling for silver for the second
time in a row.

Friars are coming off a nationally-
televised 88-67 loss to St. John's
Saturday.

The Friars haven't been without
some success this season.
They've upset Villanova and Ge-
orgetown at the Civic Center and
have played well in other games
at home.

The Friars hope the home-court
advantage will come into play for
them and not be a repeat perfor-
mance from the last time these
two teams met. The Panthers’
Charles Smith and Jerome Lane
scored 17 points each and fresh-
man Bobby Martin added 15.
Lane also pulled down 17 re-
bounds and shattered one back-
board, pacing Pitt to a 90-56 win.
