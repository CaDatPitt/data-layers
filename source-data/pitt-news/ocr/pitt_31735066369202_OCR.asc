Presidential Candidates View The Issues

DREW DIMACCIO

 

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

The two candidates for Student
Government Board president——
Drew DiMaccio and Stan Galan-
ski—have'expressed concern on a
variety of issues ranging from
Student Union renovations to the
revamping of the newly-formed Pitt
Union Program Council.

DiMaccio and Galanski are two
of the 16 ‘Student Government
hopefuls running for the seven
open positions in next week’s

elections.

According to the Student Gov-
ernment constitution, the board
president has the power to vote, to
chair the board, to act as
spokesman and direct’ the activities
of the other six board members.

This weekend _, the Pitt News
conducted’ interviews with both
DiMaccio and Galanski.

A plan that would eliminate the
need for overall chairman of the
Pitt Union Program Council and
incorporate the music and special
interests committees into one
entertainment committee was out-
lined by"Associate Student activit-
ies Director Terry.Milani at last

Wednesday's Student Government

board meeting.

Milani’s ﬁve-part proposal, un-
animously approved by the board,
also calls for a minimum of five
students in each committee, a
turnover of chairmen and members
this term and allows small transfers
of money among various commit-
tees.

___Ins~ide today ’s Pitt News

Student Government elections are only a week
away and this year’s slate presents a bewildering
array of 13 board candidates and two presiden-
tial candidates that Pitt students must examine

“The role of the chairman was
never clear-cut with definite
responsibilities,” Milani said.
“Now is the appropriate time to
replace the chairmen and members
of the PUPC.”

Milani said the current council,

-still headed by Tammy Haddad,

has done" a “better job in planning
and executing this term already.”
He" cited plans which include
dances, three coffee houses and
noontime programming in Uncle
Charlies restaurant in’ the base-
ment of Schenley Hall.

Milani also said individual

chairmen should have terms of V
office from January to January so"

that by April 1, the council already

concert chairman and a member of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity said
that one of his top priorities lies
with the commuter student.
“There are so many commuters
and their interests are so diverse

- that it isidifﬁcult to say that just

afternoon movies are going to cover
all of their interests,” DiMaccio
said. . “I was a commuter for two
years and I know that when I had a
lunch break I was interested in
eating lunch, not going to see a
movie.”

DiMaccio said that, in light of the
recent discussion concerning the
renovation of the existing Student
Union, he would favor any
renovations that would benefit
commuters.

DiMaccio also said that he would
like to see some changes made in
the existing Pitt Union Program
Council, with possibly a renegotia-
tion of it’s contract with Student

Government and the Office of
Student Activities. _
“The concept of PUPC is good,
but I feel that the programming
should be directed more toward
major program__ming,”

in seeing eight quality programs
during the year rather than 30 or
31.”

DiMaccio advocated budget cuts
thatwould directly affect Student
government.

He cited the Public and
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee as one arm of Student
Government needing its budget
trimmed. DiMaccio said that in
order to cut its budget of $3,500 for
10 lobbying trips throughtout the
year, the committee might make
better use of bulk mailings. He
added that he believed these

mailings, which would send one or-

Judicial Board Delays V Vote on
Governence Group Amendment

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Campus .Judicial Board
handed down a decision Thursday
that blocked placement of an
Engineering Student Cabinet pro-
posal calling for major redistribu-
tion of Student Activities fees to
seven major governance groups
from appearing on the upcoming
Student Government Baord Elec-
tion ballot. ,

The judicial board voted down a
request by Engineering Student
Cabinet president Barb Klepcic,

member Bernie Popko to have the
proposal put on a referendum.
Judicial board member Steve
Fendler added that the board voted
against putting the proposal on the

“This would build in a sense of
continuity, ” Milani said.

The Board also approved, by a
vote of 5-1, an elections committee
proposal to distribute 2,000 ﬂyers
with the candidates’ pictures
around campus prior to elections

“The ﬂyers with the candidates’
pictures area worthwhile idea,”

Thirteen SGB Hopefuls Express Their Views

and Lothrop Hall.

By MIKE KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

With the Student Government Board Elections just around
the corner 13 candidates are vying for the six vacant
positions. There are no incumbants running in this years
race. The polls will open next Monday in the Cathedral of
Learning, Student Union, Towers Lobby, Hillman Library

Thus far, two student organizations have announced en-
dorsements for the race. The College Young Democrats and
the campus radio station, WPGH, have endorsed the
following candidates: President - Stan Galanski, Board - Bob
Daley, Gregg Feinberg, Helen Gianella and Todd Park.

MIKE CHMELOVSKY

Sophomore

 

 

ovsky said he g

council and the ‘-
governance
group funding
amendment are
the campaign issues and that they
“are all linked together.”

As for the proposed amendment,
Chmelovsky said he believed it was
good and bad. »

“‘The ﬂat rate is a “great idea
because. it doesn’t neglect any-
body,” said Chmelovsky, but it
(allocations) should go on -how
much a group wants to achieve and

' be based on how much it puts back

into the University.”

Chmelovsky said he believes
there should be a “thorough
investigation” of the program
committee. “lt’s a good thing,” he
said. “But it should be
reorganued.”

Concerning allocations, Chmel-
ovsky said, “Commuters don’t
have anything to do here. Most of
it (allocations monies) should go to
people who live here.” -

Chmelovsky said he was opposed
to any additional student expense
to finance renovation .of the
Student Union .

would help to makethe student
body more aware of the various
programs open for student part-
icipation.

She said she would like to get
involved in
student activities, particularly the
program council. “I feel the PUPC
should be revamped to make it
much more efficient,” said Cor-
disco. ‘ ‘I want commuters involved
in that.” I

As for allocations of student
funds, Cordisco said, “My only
priority would be to allocate money
where the greatest input would
be.”

Crodisco called the governance
group funding amendment “un-
wise” because “I don’t think it will
alleviate the problems we have
now..(and) it will eliminate smaller
student groups (by redirecting
funds).”

PAM cunnv I

Pam Curry said that Student
Government “is
a way I can get
involved with all
the people, and I
feel I'm a ’peo-
ple’ person. I’m
very creative

and hope my
ideas can help
someone. ’ ’  .

The CAS junior said that she
feels allocations should go to
“student-oriented groups first, and
community-oriented groups should
have second priority.”

About the governance group
funding amendment, Curry said,
“The waypit stands now, no, I’m
against it. At $2,000 (the
blanket grant for governance
groups in the proposal), that’s a lot
of money, and some organizations
don’t need that.

“I don’t think PUPC is geared
toward’ every student,” said Curry.
“Pitt is a rainbow of culture with
people from different back-
grounds.”

Curry said she is against any

 

kind of Student Activities fee for
the renovation of the Student
Union.

She feels the SGB should be such
that “the student can go"to the
board for information,” and that
the board should maintain close
ties with the administration.

BOB DALEY
“Obviously,
allocations are
the most im-
portant thing
the student go-
vernment

does,” said CAS
junior Bob Dal-
ey. “Highest
priority should

  

service
committees (Legal Awareness,
Public and Governmental Rela-
tions), then large organizations,
but not simply because they're

go to

large._ Small, special interest
organizations should follow. ’ ’

As for the program council,
Daley said, “It limits student
involvement. “Their place is to
coordinate campus wide program-
ming. As far as small concerts and
lectures, the (sponsoring) organiza-
tions should be involved as much as
possible,” he said.

Daley said the $110,000 funding
for the council is “entirely too high
for a new organization. I
personally feel they should go
straight to the allocations commit-
tee for money.”

Daley said the SGB should act as
a liason between the students and
the administration. He said the
SGB should serve in a role of
“advocacy for what can be done for
the students.”

Daley said he opposed the
governance group funding amend-
ment. “I don’t agree with blanket
funding,” he said. “The basic
thing should be quality of
programming.’ ’

CINDY DEMATTEO

“I could do
better things as
an SGB member 
than I can do 1'
behind the win-
dow of the (Stu-
dent Union)
ticket office
where I work,”
said Cindy De- * '

Matteo, a social work major who

has been a student at Pitt

intermittently for the past five

' years.

DeMatteo listed _commuter in-
University. “Realistically there's
little we can do as far as busing or
parking is concerned, What we

‘dred thousand

 

could do is reinstate the carpool,”
she said. .

“We should definitely push for
renovation of the Student Union,"
said Dematteo. “Compared to
other universities, we are so far
behind.”

DeMatteo said she wasn't
opposed to an additional student
fee for the renovation of the Union.
“It’s going to come out of our
pockets one way or other.
Idon’t think students would be
that horribly ofended,” DeMatteo
said.

DeMatteo said she believes
allocations should go to the student
groups that do the most program-
ming. “lt’s not how many people
you represent. It’s how many you
affect.”

She called the governance group
funding amendment “grossly un-
fair” and “irresponsible” because
she said the funding for it will be at
the expense of the smaller student
groups.

As to dealing with the admini-
stration, DeMatteo said, “The
administration looks. at the SGB
and says ‘nice kids, don’t bother
me!” The SGB should get advice

from the student body and go to the

administration. ’ ’

I GREGG FEINBERG

Feinberg said he
would like to see

“One hun-/

Feinberg.

As for allocations, Feinberg said

tight-ﬁsted as possible.” He said

he would like to establish an’

allocations subcommittee to screen
all allocations requests

Feinberg believes the student
co-op should be expanded.

“We couldsell anything from

plained.

About the PUPC, * Feinberg

Feinberg said he was opposed to
the governance group funding

he said, was “accountability,
determining membership. I don’t
favor giving money as a package

heads—look at what groups were
given last year, how it was spent,
and what they did.”

HELEN GIANELLA

As a member
of the Student
Government
Commuter Af-
fairs Commit-
tee, CAS junior
Helen Gianella
said she has the
experience
needed to be an
effective SGB member.

“Someone without experience
will spend at least half a term
getting acquainted with student
government, ’ ’ she explained.

“Activities that react to the
greatest number of students,”
Gianella said should be given top
priority in_ allocations,” Gover-
nance should get high priority,
then student government, then
smaller groups,” she said. ’

However, Gianella said she was
opposed to the governance group
funding amendment. “Alot of
things are omitted and it will kill

  

small groups and committees,” she '

said.

Gianella said she was in favor of
overnight accommodations for
commuters in the Student Union,
and would also like to see another
cafeteria and .- more recreational
facilities in the Union, but is
opposed to any additional student
expense for renovation. .

She said she felt it possible to
“streamline” the PUPC. “I.’m
opposed to the huge sum of money
given to the PUPC,” she. said.

TOM KUNKEL

Sophomore
CAS student
Tom Kunke

would like to
see an “Oakland

route bus loop
to swing around
Oakland about
once an hour.”

He would like
to get commuters involved in
Student Government. Kunke]
believes this can be done through
the commuter committee by
creating ties between the Student
Government, the administration
and the commuters themselves.

About allocations, Kunkel said,-

SGB Candidates Discuss The Issues

(Continued from page 2)
“The big thing is that you have to

 look at what groups have done in

the past. You have to look at how
the organization appeals to the
average student. Is the group out
to get everybody involved or just
their own little group?"

Kunkel jfavored the governance
group funding amendment as a
“guideline, not a rule. You have to
look at what the group has done. I

Ithink it's great tllnat students are
that involved.” ‘J ‘

Kunkle said he was opposed to
any additional expense concerning
Student Union renovation, and
about the PUPC he said, “I
represent the average guy, and I
know the average guy is worried
about it.”

BARB MADEUS

CAS sopho-
more Barb Ma-
daus said Stu-
de_nti Govern-
ment is a “Hazy
joke to the little
guy,” and, as
she considers
herself a “little
guy,” she’d like
to change that.

She said she would like to start
an “informational drive for more
student input. Student Govern-
ment is not truly representative
when only groups with clout are
served.” Madaus said by this she
meant the governance groups.

“The main problem is (lack of)
communications,” said Madaus,
“Inﬁghting that doesn’t serve the
best interests\of the students."

Madaus also said that, as both a
commuter and a transfer student,
she felt that the two groups have
“as much right to be heard as other
students.” More parking lots,
more activities ‘for commuters, a

“like to see the
pr 0 p o s e d

 

commuter snack shop, and more
spacious lounges were all issues
Madaus believed to be ‘important.

the Public and Governmental
Relations Committee). With the
“Reefer Madness” program ‘the
government relations committee

campaign to raise interest in -.

marijuana decriminalization) we
got 300 people to listen to a political
speech! ’ ’

Park questioned the much
discussed Student Union renova-
tions: “Who pays for it and how
much? I don’t think we (students)
should foot the whole bill when the
Union isn't exclusively for stu-
dents.” He said, however, that he
would like to see a student bar in
the Union, and increased recrea-
tional facilities, if feasible.

Park said he is “totally against”
the governance group funding
amendment. because of “‘no
control of the quality of program-
ming, and because there’s more
students on paper than actually in
the governance groups. “A
black-Greekfresident-engineer"
wouldbe counted four times as a
governance group member, he
added.

As for SGB involvement with the
administration, “Student Govern-

ment should keep it’s eye on the
administration,” said Park.

GENE TABACHNICK
Gene Tabach- //’/
nick is a Fresh-
man engineer
who feels his
class standing
and his major"
enable him to
represent two
major groups of
students who
have lacked re-
presentation in the past.

Tabachnick said he believes the
SGB must work with the admini-
stration. “It (SGB) is the student’s
tie with the administration. It
should work with the University,”
he said. '

“I think'we need freshmen and
engineers represented on teh
board,” said Tabachnick. We need
an engineer on the board to
represent 2,000 engineering ma-
jors. I think the student
government should help freshmen
to make the changes and adjust-
ments necessary when you enter
college.”

Tabachnick also said he was very
interested in commuter interests.
“Being a commuter, I have first
hand knowledge of a commuter’s
problems. I'd like to see the
recreational room (in the Student
Union) expanded.”\

He said, however, that any
expansion, in the Student Union
should .not‘ be done at any
additional or special cost to the
student body but that it is “part of
the University’s obligations” to the
students to make renovations.

  
  
 
 

Tabachnick said he felt the‘

current allocations process is
“adequate,” and even if priorities
are sometimes misguided, he said
he feels the request system now
being used is “about the best way
to do it (allocate funds). ”

two persons, along with letters
from students, to their legislators,
would be just as effective as
sending large groups of students to
Harrisburg. '

DiMaccio said that Student'

Government might have cut costs
by eliminating the $10,000 expen-
diture for the. Undergraduate
Academic’ Review issued at the end
of last term. DiMaccio said that not
every student received a copy of
the review and that students might
benefit more by putting them at
central locations such as the
advising centers and the library.
Galanski said that he will work
for changes in the Pitt Union
Program Council but hesitated to
speak specifically of any changes
pending the result of studies being

conducted by a special program
council task force of which he is a
member. Galanski said that while
he initially voted against the
program council when it was in its
planning stages and was later one
of its most stringent opponents, he
is now very much in favor of the
council in concept.

On the subject of Student Union
renovations, Galanski said that
while the building is very much in
need of renovation, he does not
believe that students should be
forced to pay any fee to finance the
project. Galanski cited the fact that
administrative and faculty offices
are located on many of the floors in
Schenley Hall and the students
should not be forced to pay to
remodel those offices.

Galanski said that he will back-

extensive lobbying on the issues of
marijuana decriminalization, low-
ering the drinking age and state
appropriations for higher educa:
tion.

Galanski also cited the apparent _

waste‘ of funds by SGB in
distributing over 10,000 copies of
the Undergraduate Academic Re-
view campus-wide. Galanski said
he believed it would have been far
more effective 'to make hardcover
permanent" copies to be placed in
the library and other places of
access.

Galanski and DiMaccio will meet
to discuss these and other issues in
depth on Wednesday from 11a.m.
to 2p.m. in a presidential debate to
be moderated by Allegheny County
District Attorney Robert Colville.

said Wallender. “I’d like to set up

KIM WATTERSON

Kim Water- I
son, a junior
CAS student
who has been a
member of the V
Senate Commi-
tee on Student 
Affairs during
the past year
said that her . ,
allocation priorities would go to
well-established student organiza-
tions who have contributed to the
university in some way.

She said that ‘she does not
support the governance group

 

  

funding amendment as it was
introduced to the public last week.
She added that groups such as the
Greeks should not be allocated

money until they state some
purpose for the funds.

Watterson also advocated asking
the Interfraternity Council and
Panhellenic Assocation to appoint a
laison to the Student Government
Board. This laison would be
responsible for attending all SGB
meetings and giving the Greek
viewpoint on all issues. She said
that SGB should also. appoint a
laison to the two Greek organiza-
tions.

Watterson said that as an SGB -

member, she and other board
members must maintain good
relations with the administration, if
they hope to accomplish anything.

(Continued from page 1)

DiMaccio said,_” but that it simply
be given more time to be publicized
and reviewed by the students.”
The judicial board also ruled in
favor of placing the revised Student
‘Government Board constitution as
drawn up by the Constitutional
Review Committee on a referen-
dum for a “vote in the upcoming
SGB elections. Several changes,
were made, including addition of
two more members to the judicial
board and a change in the size of
the Student Government Board
.from seven members to nine.
The new constitution also would
allow the Student Government
Board Assembly to elect a
chairman from the assembly rather
than having one of the board
members assume this position.
If approved by students in next
week's referendum, the new
constitution will take effect in
November.

Opinion
Breakout
the Beanies

Encouraging Pitt students to do anything has
becomea thankless—-and invariably fruitless—task
asthe university has grown. Even when the desired
action likely will benefit the student, he is unwilling
to do much more than that which is absolutely
necessary. ‘

Voting for student government representatives is
nearly painless, it can be nearly as easy as voting for
homecoming candidates, though no crazy hats nor
kazoos are offered as reward. But the turnout each
year is sickeningly small. ‘

This could be a sign students do not expect much
of student government after the mandatory activity

Pitt’s student activities office is to be commended
for its desire to increase turnout at next week’s
student government elections, but while some aspects
of its campaign are well-conceived, other portions of
the plan threaten to turn the voting into a 15-
candidate circus.

Extra voting days are needed, and we will have
them this year. Additional polling places are a
welcome addition to a campus‘ as fragmented as this.
but a moronic advertising campaign and a proposed
halftime “meet the candidates” "show at the Jan. 25
Pitt-Mercyhurst basketball game are cause for con-
cern and comment.

It may be that these trappings will encourage Pitt
stu'dents—and candidates—to take student govern-
ment a bit less seriously, and that would be good. A
rational view of student government’s place on cam-
pus would be a welcome addition to the Student
Union’s third floor.

Page 6—Monday, January 15', 1979

Pitt’s basketball players would do well to worry more
about the last few minutes of the game.

And the free Cokes aren't necessary. The student
activities office still has a supply of those beanies
from the most recent homecoming election, and
those hats would seem to be especially appropriate at
this time.

Students should vote——and carefully--next week,
but not because they will receive a free Coke while

' the successful candidate gives himself a “New Year’s

gif .”

fee is paid each term, and Pitt students could be

forgiven such a pessimistic view.

.Whatever the reason for student behavior, this fact
remains: Some 1,500 persons participated in the elec-
tion that gave them Josh Baylson as student gover-
nment board president and approximately 2,500
students voted when Cathy. Leo was named

homecoming queen.

Letters

Board‘? ’ ’

for the amendment...

It is apparent from The Pitt News
editorial entitled “A Change for
the Better?,” (Jan. 10) that the
author could not have read, or
simply did not choose to read the
copyvof the “Governance Group
Funding Amendment” proposed
by Drew DiMaccio which was
forwarded to them. Their assess-
ment of the amendment would
have undoubtedly‘ been quite a bit
different if they had read it.

-After giving the amendment the
due consideration that it deserves,
it is obvious that every complaint
lodged against it can be de--
molished. With regard to Stan
Galanski’s fear that “It would be
hard for Student Government to
monitor how funds would be
spent,” Part B of Section 4 of the
amendment states that “NO
organization shall be permitted to
spend any of its authorized
allocation without prior notiﬁcation
of both the Student Government
Board and the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities . ’ ’ . D

Part C of Section 4 of the
amendment states, “All gover-‘
nanee groups shall be required to
submit speciﬁc reports detailing all
expenditures, on a monthly basis,

to both the SGB Allocations
Committee and the Ofﬁce of
Student Activities.” Part D
continues by stating that “The SGB
Allocations . Committee...and the
SGB...sha1l have full authority to
freezer ~ the budget of any gover-
nance group, upon the discovery of
‘evidence indicating misuseiand/or_
misappropriation of funds.”
Those who argue that some

, governance groups will receive

substantial and unwarranted cuts
in their authorized allocation refuse —\
to recognize that the amendment
simply sets a lower foundation for
appropriations to the governance
groups, and that under Part A of

_ Section 5, “A governance group

may request funds in excess of
those granted under this amend-
ment, but such a request must be
accompanied by a speciﬁc proposal

"detailing just why such additional

funding is needed...” Presumably,
governance groups with justiﬁable
proposals will receive additional
funding, in accordance with the
quality and value of their additional
requests.

Lastly, those who cry that
student organizations would suffer
considerable damage bec-au_se of an

We think not.

But need this be accomplished by distributing free
Cokes, having Pitt’s basketball players announce
their intentions to vote and encouraging students to
seek office with an ad that reads “Give yourself a
New Year’s gift-get elected to Student Government

increase in funding to the
governance groups are not cogni-
zant of the bloated nature of the
Student Government budget, a
budget where substantial cuts
could be made and which looks
more like a “wish list” than a
rational allocation of scarce re-
sources; nor are they cognizant that
Section 7 of the amendment calls
for 5‘The SGB, in. cooperation with

—;s'.fthe* gfﬁce, of Student5 Actiyities, to

renegotiate. the “PUP'CaT'co’n‘fract in
order to provide more equitable
funding for student organiza-
tions.”

Once irrational “pot shots” at
the amendment have cleared the
air, it is possible to see the truly
equitable nature of the amend-
ment. For the ﬁrst time
ever, the seven governance
groups—which serve approximate-
ly 7,500 to 8,000 different stu-
dents—will be guaranteed a solid
funding base in relation to the size
of the constituencies which they
must serve, ‘rather than a funding
based dependent upon the political
and biased whims and vagaries of
the SGB; whims and vagaries
which are not recognized as such
until one serves on that “august”
body.

For the ﬁrst time ever, they will
have sufﬁcient resources to attend
to the needs of their constituencies
with allocation decisions made by

The Governance Group Funding Issue

those student leaders who are
CLOSEST to the problems and
needs of each constituency.
Arguing that the governance
groups are irresponsible and will
waste money is, ﬁrst of all, nothing
other than a slap in their face; nor
does it recognize that the students
making the decisions in each of the
governance groups are themselves
elected -representatives responsible

to ‘their respective constituencies. .0

This argument about projected
governance group “irresponsib-
ility” is most interesting when one
notes that the leaders of the seven
governance groups, who will be
presiding over the “supposed”
future misallocation of funds, are
seven of the fourteen students who
serve on the Student Affairs
Advisory Council (SAAC) to Chan-
cellor Posvar and are already
viewed as responsible individuals.
Lastly, those who decry the
proposal seem to forget that it is
not ‘the SGB’s morhey which is
being allocated, but rather the
STUDENTS’!

The “Governance Group Fund-
ing Amendment" is nothing other
than a fresh, futuristic and

equitable approach to the distribu- .

tion of a small portion of the
Student Activities Fee. It says to
the governance groups, “Here are
the resources you need—go serve
your constituents. We think you
are responsible enough to do so
wisely.” DiMaccio should be
commended for his endorsement of
the proposal. 

As for the argument of The Pitt
News that the proposal is “sketchy
at best...(and) should not - be
approved by the student body”, it
is sketchy only in the minds of
those who were not responsible
enough to read it before publicly
commenting, are unacceptable
only to those not familiar enough

with the student government-gov- -

ernance group relationship to see
the proposa1’s merits. ‘

SGB Member

...and against it

I am responding to an article by

' Mike Kane (The Pitt News, Jan.

12) on Drew DiMaccio’s proposal to
institute a constitutional change in
the student fund allocation process.

DiMaccio obviously is campaign-
ing hard for the position of Student
Government Board president. Why
else would he propose such a
If his proposal is
approved, then he becomes‘ the
“good guy.’.’ If it is rejected, he
still retains the “good guy” status
by pointing out that he tried, but
the “other people” were respon-
sible for his defeat. It is a very
brave person who can say‘ “No” to
excess spending. Apparently, from
this article, Stan Galanski is the
only brave one within the student
government.

In "a round—about manner,
DiMaccio‘ is attempting to buy
votes. But one must admit it is
clever: using other people’s money
to get what he wants. He gives the
impression that he has had no prior
experience in the supervising of
groups of people and the control-
ling ‘of the related monies. ,

The key to good management of

any organization, be it business,-
,__civic, or government. is the tight‘

and ever watchful‘control over the
“purse strings.”—not in a miserly
fashion. which would cripple the
organization, but just enough
control to demonstrate ﬁscal
responsibility. This tends to weed
out the many impulses from clubs
and organizations to submit ridicu-
lous money requests that is so often
made to a central governing body.

I am not “talking through my
hat" on this issue. I attended Penn
State University’s Shenango Valley
Campus in Sharon, Pa. and was
elected as Student Government
President for the year 1975-76—so
I know what it is like to ﬁgure out
and control a budget of large
amounts of money. One thing one
does not do is, in effect, give a child
$20 and push them into a candy
store. This is especially true when
you are supervising the spending of
money that came from other people
in the form of activity fees.

I, personally, have never met
neither DiMaccio nor Galanski.
However, I can assure Galanski

‘that solely based on his response to

DiMaccio’s allocation
that he has my vote.

Buchanan Gives “UnprofessionaI” Performance

 

Bay Buchanan performed at the Stanley Saturday.

By MARK HOLAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

V The house lights were still on when a small
blond-haired boy of about seven walked on stage. He
stood still at the microphone stand, which had been
lowered to his height ' and gazed out on the
screaming,‘ sell-out crowd at the Stanley Theater.

“My dad, Roy Buchanan, music’s greatest
guitarist,” he said in a quiet voice that was
immediately drowned in a cacaphony of applause.
The house lights died and Roy Buchanan took the
stage.

Not too many people would have argued with Roy’s
boy. Over the past four years, Buchanan has quietly
but consistantly built a solid reputation and a strong
following. Though not a shining commercial success,
Buchanan has always been regarded most highly in
thecircle of rock-blues guitarists.

Saturday night’s performance at the Stanley,
however, was a disillusioning disappointment.
Sure, Buchanan can play just as well as ever, if he’s
in the mood. He was not at this show.

between opening act Ezy Elmer, a Western
Pennsylvania country rock band, and Buchanan
might not have seemed so long. But is was, and
unnecessarily so. When, Buchanan ﬁnally did
appear, he seemed more intent on proving -to the
audience that he could drink Michelob, smoke
cigarettes and generally glory in the fact that he was
Roy Buchanan.

His playing on such numbers as “Roy’s Blues,”
. “Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On,” “Don’t Turn Me

- For blind followers and hard‘ partiers, the wait ’

Away,” “Green Onions” and ‘‘I‘m Evil” was at best
adaquate, considering his reputation, but was often,
in fact, quite boring.

His guitar solos never really took off and they V

never really went anywhere. At one point, he spent
"ﬁve minutes plucking and distorting his E string 'by
-merely tightening and loosening the tuning

» key——very boring.

Also in the show was a tribute to Jimi Hendrix,
including Buchanan’s version of “Hey Jude” and
“Let Me Stand Next To Your Fire.” No mention was
ever made of Hendrix, however.

His set ran about two hours but was marred
severely by breaks that were too short to be
intermissions and too long to be stage calls. '

“Roy’s busy. He’ll be back in a minute,” the
audience was told after one such departure. Only
those Buchanan groupies could have believed that it
takes ﬁfteen minutes to change one busted guitar
string. .

Roy didn't want to play. I

Never mind that he said upon returning, ‘‘If I had
to choose. it would be Pittsburgh.” Buchanan must
have known he was giving a bad performance, and
merely recognizing the city that you are playing‘ in
doesn’t amend that.

Worse than the long breaks and aimless jams were
the amps that buzzed unchecked during the entire
concert and the feedback that stopped the show
completely at one point. All in all, the concert was
only an ego trip for Buchanan—an unprofessional
studio session that wasn’t worth the price of
admission.

One more added disapointment: Roy Buchanan
did not play “The Messiah.”

ﬂGuthrie’s Album Gives Listeners A Good Time

By MIKE KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer
Arlo Guthrie’s‘ ﬁrst release of
new recordings in two years, called
“One Night,” is exactly that. It’s a
live album, full of songs recorded
live one night at an Arlo Guthrie
concert.

Anyone who has ever been to a
Guthrie concert (he has been
backed for the past three or four
years‘ by a pretty tight band called
Shenandoah, and this is the first
time they have ,recorded together)
what an unforgettable
experience it can be. His concerts
are social affairs; Guthrie has such

an eclectic personality that he
seems to spark his audiences into
enjoying the concerts as a unit.

Anyone that has ever listened to

an Arlo Guthrie album also knows

what a great experience that can
be. Guthrie is a natural songwriter,
as he should be since his old man
was folksinger Woody Guthrie.

His songs never overpower you,
but are always of a consistantly
high quality, ,, with good lyrical
imagery and tasteful melodies.

With a buildup like this, it should
follow that a live Arlo Guthrie with

Shenandoah album would be
fantastic, Right? Wrong!

“One Night” is a good album,
better. than most that are released
today, but it neither matches
actually being at one of Guthrie’s
concerts nor the quality of one of
his past studio albums. The energy
of a live concert is missing, and the
ﬁne writing on past Guthrie albums
is also missing because only one of
his own songs appears on the
album.

But,that’s not a pan of the
record———the band’s ﬁne perfor-

mance of some good songs saves
the record from mediocrity. A
version of Lennon-McCartney’s
“I’ve Just Seen a Face,” shot full
of up-tempo bluegrass banjo could
be the best rendition of a Beatle
song ever, or at least the most
interesting.

Arlo ressurected “Tennessee
Stud,” Jimmy Driftwood’s classic
country tune, as well as a couple of
traditional folk songs, including
“Last Night I Had the Strangest
Dream.” In this song Shenan-
doah’s acapella vocals assume an
interesting, almost erie baroque
effect.

song.

The only real loser ongthe album
is something called “The Story of
Reuben Clamso and his Strange
Daughter in the Key of A,” a long
monologue followed by a short
The song is good—the
monologue bad. It’s too long,
albeit with a few funny lines,
particularly about nuclear» power,
and Guthrie sounds too high to do it
well.

The live crowd seemed to love it
(it’s doubtful that Arlo would stoop
to using a laugh track). It seems it
would have been much more
rewarding to have been there for
“One Night.”

  TheaterProduotion or Camille “Touching”

By MARTHA GARVEY

Pitt News Staffwriter

Camille ,
99 Cent Floating Theater

Charles Ludlam’s Camille may
have hair on her chest, but she has
virtue in her heart.

_The 99 Cent Floating Theater
presented Ludlam and the Ridicul-
ous Theatrical Company’s produc-
tion of “Camille” at Stephen
Foster Memorial last Thursday
through Saturday. Ludlam’s
Camille—in lavender tulle and pink
toe shoes—-may have resembled a
muscle bound butterﬂy more than a
tubercular courtesan, but he and
his company presented a touching
and hilarious version of ‘ ‘Camille ”.

Camille (Charles Ludlam) is
bored with her life as a courtesan in
Paris. Her rich old suitor Baron de
Varville (John D. Brockmeyer)
offers her security and freedom
from debt, but only if she will live
with him in Siberia.

» (Adam

While the creditors demand their
cash, Armand Duval (Bill Vehr),
young and penniless, claims to love
her truly. a “What to do,” moans
Camille, in an accent midway
between a terminal head cold and
respectability.

True love conquers only brieﬂy.
Camille rejects Armand to preserve
his reputation and the lady of the
camellias wastes slowly away, from
tuberculosis and lack of love.
Armand and Camille have a tearful
reconciliation, but then it’s curtains
for Camille.

“Camille” is a zoo full of acting
styles. As the material whizes from
the burlesque to tragedy the actors

move from pop-eyed overplaying to .

subtle, tiny movement. True to the
spirit of the ridiculous, the three
woman played by men—Camille,
her friend Nichette (Everett Quin-
ton) and Camille’s maid Nanine
McAdam) are far more
natural and unaffected. than the
bizarre cartoons of Black-Eyed
Susan as Olympe and Lola

Pashalinski as Prudence.

The silent stars of “Camille”
deservemention: the set-s and the
costumes. Bob Jack Callejo’s
backdrops are appropriately post-,
er-paing garish and artiﬁcial, and

Mary Brecht’s costumes combine
the right amounts of romance and
tackiness. Olympe’s gown-seem-
ingly made of circus tent and a
handful of helium balloons—almost
steals the show.

If it did Ludlam would steal it
right back. As writer and director
of “Camille”, he is true to the
spirit of Camille—never boring and
often outrageous. As the sad-eyed
lady of the salon, he is dazzling.

Clint “Loose,” But Monkey Stars

By PATTY TASCARELLA

“Every Which Way But Loose”
is billed as a comedy, but the
running gags and excessive vulgar-
ities that make up the script are
tasteless and tedious. They sprawl
across the screen every which way
but controlled.

The picture is the annual
Christmas offering from Clint
Eastwood, the ultimate Marlboro
Man, who evidently is following the
lead of fellow macho star Burt
Reynolds from violent cowboy
ﬂicks to cowboy comedic but it
doesn’t work in “Every Which Way
But Loose” where hate is

‘I “O|iver’sStory”— Let “Love Story” Rest

By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE
Pitt News Staff Writer

What can you say about a girl
who dies?

After viewing the sequel to Erich
Segal's “Love Story,” titled
“Oliver’s Story" (which Segal also
authored), the answer is: too much.

The movie, starring Ryan 0’ Neal
and Candice Bergen, is nothing
more than a shoddy attempt by
Hollywood movie moguls to cash in
on the success of “Love Story,”
(which featured O’Neal and Ali
MacGraw).

The movie opens where “Love
Story" left off. Oliver Barrett
(O’Neal) is sitting on a park bench
with tears in his eyes over the loss
of his beloved Jenny, who has just
died from leukemia. The scene
then switches to a graveyard,
where Jenny is to be buried, and
Oliver is to say his last good-bye.

As can be imagined, however,
Oliver cannot get the thought of
Jenny out of his mind, even though
his parents and father-in-law

repeatedly attempt to get him out

of his depressed state.
Oliver’s days are totally devoted

 to his work as a—New York City

‘vat



lawyer (where he is desparately

trying to aid ghetto people in their

attempt to obtain a housing
permit). His nights are completely
sleepless, and he refuses.to have
any social life.

Finally, Oliver decides that he
needs the assistance of a psychia-
trist, who suggestsithat he take up
athletics as a means of getting his
mind off Jenny. It is when he starts
his new activity that he meets
Marcie Teller (Bergen) as she is
jogging through the park.

From there, “Oliver’s Story”
becomes a love story all over again.

The relationships between Oliver ‘

and Marcie and Oliver and his
father (Ray Milland, also repeating
his role from “Love Story”) finish
up the remainder of the film, which
has a slightly different sort of
ending than one might expect.

O’Neal plays his role in a rather
juvenile fashion. The highlight of
his performance in the ﬁlm is
ﬁnding out that he has a boil on his
gluteus maximus (something that

all Ryan O’Neal fans are dying to '

see).

Bergen plays a beautiful, stereo-
typed socialite. Aside from her
great looks, she doesn’t give that
memorable a performance.

To sum it allup, the movie never
really starts and, in the same

breath, never really ends. It makes
you wonder what the Hollywood
crowd is going to call the next
sequel. If we're all lucky, we may
never have to learn the answer to
that question. Save your money.
Buy the book.

Pitt News Staff Writer
p After defeating West Virginia in
a ‘double dual meet last Wednes-
day, both Pitt’s men’s and
women’s gymnastics teams lost to
Penn State Saturday at University

. Park.

Gymnast Bonnie Tressler works her routine on the unevens.

Samson was not the only one on
the courtpwho had a good night
from the field. A total of nine
play'ers reached double ﬁgures in a
game marked by ﬁghts. Inconsis-
tent ofﬁciating, plus an unusual
amount of pushing, shoving and
elbowing led to ﬂared tempers,
which in turn led to a wild ﬁnal
minute.

With 1:51 remaining and GW
ahead, 83-73, a pair of free throws
by Terry‘Knight and an.inbound-
pass theft and lay-up by‘Carlton
Neverson cut the margin to six,
then ﬁve, half-a-minute later.

At this point the Panthers were
playing at perhaps the most intense
level reached thus far this season.

‘While Pitt’s Scott Grevey was

intentionally fouling GW guard
Curtis Jeffries, Panther Dwayne
Wallace and Colonial Tom Tate
exchanged punches.

In the mad encounter that
followed, both teams came ﬂying
off their respective benches. Both
Wallace and Tate were ejected
from the game after Wallace was
kicked in the face by a fan.

George Washington was award-
ed four foul shots, a pair from
Grevey’s foul and two. technical
free throws. As they had all
evening, GW proﬁted from the foul
shots and raised the lead to an
insurmountable nine points.

Assistant coach Cleve Edwards
said that despite fouls, the team
played “just great at the end of
both halves. We only had eight
turnovers for the whole game (Pitt

The men -(1-2) were simply
outclassed by the Nittany Lions,
who won 216.35-188.6, according to
Panther Coach Frank D’Amico.

had been averaging somewhere
around 21 a game) and we were
ﬁred up.”

“For about eight minutes,” said
head coach Tim Grgurich, “we
played as hard as it was physically
possible. We were outmuscled.
They blocked a few shots, but our

° guys wouldn’t give up, they just

took it to them.

“Samson really hurt us. He
played a great game. His inside
game hurt, so’we tried to give
George Washington the outside
shot, to jam up the middle.”

The loss evened the Panther’s
record to 6-6-overall and 1-1 in
Eastern Eight competition. It was
also the team’s fourth consecutive
defeat.

“We needed a win on the road,”

~ said Neverson. “But now we need

a win, period. Tonight would have
been sweet, but I’d love to play
George Washington again. I hope
we do. Oh man, I hope we do.”

PITT NOTES: Knight led his
team in scoring for‘ the second
straight game. He ﬁnished with 25
points and nine rebounds. Sammie
Ellis was next with 18 points...

event against West Virginia and
defeated the Mountaineers, 190.5-
164.9. However, against Penn
State the Panthers were shut out of
each event. Despite this, D’Amico
said the Panthers did-better against
Penn State than West Virginia.

“-We did well, but there was just
no way we could score against a
team like Penn State,” D’Amico
said. -“They have a very strong
team. We just aren’t in their ball
park yet.”

Freshman Bob Besong had the
highest individual score for the
Panthers. Besong scored 8.7 out of
a possible 10 points on the high
bars.

Like D’Amico, women’s coach
Donna DeMarino Sanft didn’t

champion, but she said she felt it

‘We had planned on using Alison

she got hurt, it hurt us, but we still

was no excuse for blowing the

Millersville No Match 

For Pitt Wrestlers

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt won six of 10 weight

g bouts—including four -super deci-

sions—as the Panther wrestlers
destroyed Millersville, 24-11,. Sat-
urday.

The Marauders, the top-ranked
Divisionlll team in the nation,
boasted a 4-0 record and had a
home gym advantage, but were
victims of what Pitt head coach
Dave Adams called “our best effort
up to this point in the season”

“We were getting the take-
downs,” he said. “We weren’t
doing that before.”

The Panthers’ individual bout
point totals were the highest all
season, as four Pitt grapplers
trounced their opponents. At 167
pounds, Skip Bolin earned 18
points in an easy defeat of
Mi1lersville’s Randy March; Jose
Martinez trounced 126-pounder
Ken Short, 12-2; Tom Jones
destroyed 158-pounder Fran Pres_-
ley, 12-3; and Steve Gouletas
shutout 142-pounder Todd Ireland,
8-0.

“Jones
Adams said.

looked awful good,"
“On the whole, the

team did some things they never ‘

did before. But Jones’ win over
Presley (a two-time Division III

weight champion) was very impres-
sive.”

“We improved a lot from the
Lycoming match (a 25-8 Panther
victory last Tuesday),’_’ Adams
said. “Our aim is to improve every
time.”

Pitt, whose record climbed to an
even 2-2, was able to handle the
Marauders easier than Lycoming,
another Division III school, despite
Mil1ersville’s I high ranking and
on-the-road disadvantage.

“Actually, we were a little
disappointed after the _ Lycoming
victory,” Adams explained‘. “But
Millersville is deﬁnitely a better
team. They have an excellent team
for a Division 111 school..’’

The Panthers return to the Field
House for a match against
Maryland tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.

“We’ll go with the same
lineup,” Adams said, “and we’ll
have to work a little harder against
Maryland since we haven’t had
time to prepare for them.”

Pitt’s only glimpse of the

Terrapins was at the Penn State 

Invitational last December, where
the Terps ﬁnished ﬁfth. The
Panthers ﬁnished seventh.

“I thought Maryland could have
ﬁnished higher than that,”
Adams claimed. 2

Down at George Washington IJniversity’s Smith

1“ Center, they like to use acatchy little phrase on

( .

posters, bumper stickers and such: “George
Washington Basketball——A Capital Idea.” The fans

certainly seem to like the slogan. As a matter of fact, ~

many seem just about ready to demand “capital”
punishment of the entire Pitt basketball team.

Saturday’s game, as sportswriters tend to say, was
“marred by altercations.” The first indications of
any malevolence toward the visitors appeared during
pre-game warmup, when a fairly large and vocal
group of GW enthusiasts seated at midcourt began to
chant what sounded like, “We’re gonna bop ’em on
the side of the head,” while waving a few fists. Little
did anyone realize that a fan would take the cheer
literally.

From the outset, the contest was (to put it mildly)
physical. A certain amount of pushing and elbowing
is to be expected, but is generally controlled by the
officials. Unfortunately, Ernie Cage and Mike Sier-
co were horribly inconsistent in their officiating.
At times, a simple fronting of a player would be
whistled a foul, but on at least two occasions, ob-

Colonial Fans Demand ‘Capital’ Punishment

vious charging fouls where the man was actually run
over (no acting) were not called either way. ,

There were two incidents of violence, the first oc-
curring with five minutes left in the game. Panther
guard Carlton Neverson recalled the scene:

“For whatever reason, Sammie (Ellis) and the
George Washington guy (Paul Gracza) were ex-
changing words, no punching, and three or four guys
went over to help separate them when -this Mike
Zagardo came running up behind and started grab-
bing on me. We pushed some, but that was it.” _

In a normal basketball game, this would have been
the hockey lovers highpoint of the night, but the real
melee came with 43 seconds left and Pitt trailing by
five points. '

The irony of the situation was that those involved
directly in the game (players, coaches) were

reasonably collected when ‘Pitt’s Dwayne Wallace.

and the Colonials’ Tom Tate went for each other (but

not inflicting physical damage). The problem was
caused by the aforementioned fan. Wallace ended up
on the floor when a male spectator climbed down
from the stands, ran over and kicked him in the
vicinity of his left eye. It was at this point both teams
rushed over and tangled.

“We told our team to stay on the bench,” said
assistant coach Cleve Edwards. “We tried to pull
our players out from whatever was going on. But
then that guy ran out and kicked Dwayne and there
was absolutely no justification for something like
that.

“The pity of it is that the fans come to a place and
they have every right to cheer for whateverteam they
want. But when they start coming onto the floor and
attacking people, that’s sick.”

It is indeed a pity, although the ugliness of a crowd
should be nothing new to any team above the junior
high level. The incident occurred between two
Eastern Eight teams Saturday. On Sunday, fighting
broke out between twopther league teams, Duquesne

and West Virginia. Who says basketball isn?t one of »

the contact sports?

Diver Winker’s ‘P.M.A.’ Yields Pitt Points o

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt diver Scott Winkler believes
in P—.M.A.—positive mental atti-
tude.

“It’s a lot more fun when you
have it," Winkler said. “Cocki-
ness—-or should I say, conﬁ-
dence-— is so important. You have
to think positively in order to do
anything well.”

Winkler, undefeated heading
into last Saturday’s meet, needed

The Big Ten conference tradi-
tionally produces some of the top
divers in the nation, including
Olympic veterans Phil .Boggs
(Michigan State) and Kent Vossler
Winkler, a junior
from the North Hills, dived against
Vossler as a freshman.

“We’re tired of meeting the
rinky-dinks," Winkler said last
week. “It will feel good facing a
team like Ohio State for a change.
We feel we have one of the better

diving teams in the nation. This is

our chance to show how good we
really are."

season. He said he feels less
pressure than he did last season,
when he was thrust into the role of
team leader. ,

“I was only a sophomore, yet I
was the veteran,” Winkler ex-
plained. “The freshmen looked up
to me. I'm still the veteran, but our
other divers have matured. They
look up to me in a different way
than they did then.”

By his estimation, Winkler did

well last season. He qualiﬁed for-

the NCAA championship at Long
Beach, Calif., and won the Eastern
Regional individual championship
while Pitt won as a”team. The

junior expects more of the same .

this season.

“I’ve improved, and so has Pat
(Greenwell),” Winkler said.
“We’re working well as a team. I
don't knowhow he did it, but Pat
somehow got better over the
summer. He was very good last
season, but he’s even better.”

Greenwell, a Florida native who
graduated from Kiski Prep, also
was undefeated going into the Ohio
State meet.

“Our divers have come through
for us,” Pitt swim coach Fred
Lewis said. “Scott and Pat are
doing exceptionally well.”

\

Winkler added: “We like to help
the swimmers. As good as they
are, they need some help, too. A
team can get eight points if it
ﬁnishes ﬁrst and second in any
diving event.”

Winkler competes in both diving

- events, but prefers the three-meter
‘ board because he ﬁnds it “more

challenging. ’ ’

“The one-meter variety is OK,
but I consider it kind of
high-schoolish because it is low-
er,” Winkler said. “There's

something about three-meter div-_
ing that I especially enjoy.”

Old Dominion Dominates Cagers

Pitt’s women’s basketball coach
said her team’s defense “did a nice

job” at Old Dominion . Saturday‘

although the Pantherettes lost by
more than 40 points to the nation’s
top-ranked women’s team.

The Pantherettes (S-9) kept pace
with Old Dominion until midway
through the first half, when Old
Dominion used a press to expand a
three-point lead and cruise to a
97-55 win.

But Pitt coach Jean Balthaser,
whose team has yet to win on the
road, did not blame her defense.
“Turnovers are what took us out of

Divers Dandy
At Meet

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News S_taffWriter

Pitt divers finished first in three
of four events against Ohio State’s
talented Buckeyes Saturday at
Trees Pool, but travel problems
caused cancellation of Pitt-OSU
swimming competition for the
second consecutive year.

Only Steve Eberle, last season’s
NCAA runner-up, was able to earn
a victory for Ohio State Saturday.
Scott Winkler of Pitt and OSU’s
Kevin Wright trailed Eberle in
one-meter diving.

A Winkler’s three ﬁne dives won
the three-meter event. He was
followed by Buckeye Scott Trefzger

I and Panther Pat Greenwell.

Pitt’s Hilary McBride was
winner of each women’s competi-
tion; OSU’s Sheri Hornstein and
Pitt’s Holley Sluss were two-three
in one- and three-meter diving.

Pitt’s and Ohio State’s men’s
and women’s teams were.sche-
duled to meet Saturday, but Ohio
State’s bus was involved in an
accident while heading toward
Pittsburgh and the Buckeye teams
eventually returned to Columbus.
Last year’s Pitt-OSU meet was
cancelled when inclement weather
prevented Ohio State from reach-
ing Pittsburgh.-

The Panthers next will swim at
Kent State Friday; both Pitt swim
teams will host Penn
Saturday. '
