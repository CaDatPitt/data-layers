Legislature Kills Death Veto

HARRISBURG
sylvania became the 24th state to
restore the death penalty Tuesday
as the House and Senate voted to
Governor ‘ Milton
Shapp’s veto of a capital punish-
ment bill. .

The House voted 169-20 to pass
the bill over Shapp's obiections.
About an hour later, the Senate
passed an identical motion, 42-6.

It was only the second time in the
past 50 years’ that a bill was
enacted despite a gubernatorial
veto. '

Justice Department attorneys say
the law may apply to any murders
committed after the measure is

« formally signed by ' House‘ and -

Senate leaders.
It enumerates nine situations

where murder would lead to
execution.
They include: murder of a

fireman, law enforcement officer of
prison guard; murder of a
kidnapping victim; murder in the
course of a aircraft hiiacking;
murder by contract; murder of a
witness to a felony to prevent his
testimony; murder in which the
defendant knowingly creates a
“grave risk of death" to someone
in addition to the murder .victim;
murder committed by torture;
murder by _a defendant already
serving life in prison or convicted of

another offense which could result

in a life prison sentence.

Panther Hollow threotenecl ‘

Citizens Bottle NewaOola</and Highway‘

BY "MATTHEW KENNEDY
, A-proposed highway cutting through parts of the
Oakland community was approved last Friday by
Pittsburgh’s Transportation Advisory Committee
(TAC) which voted to continue feasibility studies by
the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning

Commission (SWPRPC).

The controversial highway, called the Oakland
Crosstown Expressway, is a “central link” in the
regional CYCLE II transportation designed to fill this
area’s transit need for the year 2000, according to the
SWPRPC. As planned, the highway will cut through
Panther Hollow and parts of Boundary Street near

Pitt.

John Robin of the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs who has been described as “the "4 +9 \
intellectual force behind the Pittsburgh Rennais- \
sance," was a member of TAC who voted in favor of

the highway.

“The proiect is misnamed," Robin said, “it's
really a Mid-City Crosstown and an important link in
this city's transportation system. The displacement
(of residents) in comparison to the importance of the

project is not great."

Director of City Planning Robert Paternoster was
one of the two dissenting votes on the Oakland

Citizens Fight Highway

/Continued from Page 1)

Jonathan Robison, chairperson of the Pittsburgh
Neighborhood Alliance’s Transportation Task Force
(TTF) said the proposed Oakland Crosstown would
be a fatal blow to the stability of the community.

“It would be a disaster,” Robison said, “the worst
thing that ever happened to this city. They [the
SWPRPC] don’t take into account who pays the cost
for this sort of thing. P

“Consistently it is the upper middle class
homeowners who tbeneﬁt ‘from this sort of
construction, and it is consistently the city-dwellers
who pay all the costs. -

“It’s insane to bring more cars into Oakland with
taxpayers’ money, there is just no room for them.
What we need. is a mass transit, not more
highways.” »

Robison attacked the SWPRPC’s method of,

cost-beneﬁts analysis in determining the best route
for highways to serve the community. Cost beneﬁts
analysis is a ration between the costs of construction
and the beneﬁts derived from the completed
structure. - . r

‘-‘The costs-benefits system is phony,” Robison
claimed, “it doesn’t consider the environmental
costs incurred by dumping additional traffic into a
congested area. ' A

“All of the beneﬁts go to the people living in the
suburbs, and the system doesn’t consider the cost to

_the people living in the area of the highway, that’s

th_e difference."

SWPRPC representative George Bonna said the
cost-beneﬁts studies done for the Oakland Crosstown
were the most comprehensive examinations ever
done in the country., According to‘ Bonna, the
Panther I-Iollow Route showed as one of the best
alternative corridors for the highway. H ,

“As a route the Panther Hollow-Run corridor is the
second or third highest cost benefits ration. Of all
the benefits, Oakland recieves the most. We try to

set all the 'benefits to areas along the route of the
highway,” Bonna said. ‘ \

According to the SWPRPC representative‘ the
cost-beneﬁts system tends towards considerationof
more physical, 'measureable- things. Bonna"
disagreed" with the description of the system as
inaccurate. ,. -

“The way we measure it." Bonna claimed, “is we
measure the impact of construction, vehicle
operating costs, savings in travel time, accident
savings as well as social impact studies.

“This is all very preliminary at this point, but
we've done a lot of work. It’s the best analysis that’s
ever been done in the country." ,

Ed McGee, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation [PennDOT] which also
voted against the proposal on Friday before TAC
defended the idea of circumferential systems for
Pittsburgh, and the studies which go into
construction. .

“We perform,” McGee said, “feasibility studies,

a quick look at a route between two places. One of
the corridors we've been looking at is the Oakland
Crosstown Expressway. ‘

“We know the beginning and ending of this sort of
thing, and on a one shot scale we know about the best

corridor. The baseline is laid and then we come up

with an estimate. «

McGee underlined Pittsburgh’s role_ in ‘the
decision-making process, and said City Hall would be
involved in review of the entire system. Member of
the Transportation Task Force Jeff Taylor challenged
the rationale behind the entire CYCLE II system,
especially the Oakland Crosstown segment which the
SWPRPC estimates will cost between $75 and $237
million dollars. ‘

“The cost will be horrendous,” Taylor said, “The
Oakland Crosstown is an integral part of the CYCLE
II proposal by the SWPRPC, and the Crosstown alone
will cost half of the allocation for the system.”

The TTF member described the Oakland
Crosstown ‘as an “engineering feat” utilizing two
tunnels and two bridges in the connection between
the North Hills and South'Hi_lls. _

“It’ll be a design wonder,” Taylor said, “even
though it follows a natural corridor and the SWPRPC
says there won't be a severe impact, we feel it will
have a damaging effect on community stability.

“It (the Crosstown) carries trafﬁc from suburb to
suburb, at the expense of people in this area. The
proposal as it stands will wipe out a residential area

called the Run anddisrupt homes on Boundary.

Street, what people call Little Italy, and it’will ruin

Panther Hollow." »
According to Taylor the priorities of the CYCLE II

plan should be shifted from highways to mass transit,

,.,.,a-q,

something the SWPRPC overlooked in - what he _

termed inadequate preparation for the studies.

“They didn't consider the noise level effects,” the
TTF-member said, “although this doesn’t physically
disrupt any houses or people, there will be a
migration away from this area, leaving a vacuum.”

Taylor. cited an example of inconsistencies in
SWPRPC planning in the controversial East Street
construction. ,

“It was estimated in the residential areas there
that 125 homes would be displaced by the highway,”
Taylor said. “When we went on a tour of the sites,
about two weeks ago, some SWPRPC staff members
reported that, in reality, at least 200 homes would
have to be taken, if not more."

In a written report, the SWPRPC estimated that 56
to 70 homes would be displaced by the alternative
routes described in the CYLCE II plan.

“Either of these lines (alternative routes),” reads

interchange ramps would cover many residential
properties. These and other residences would be
undesirable due to proximity to noise and air
pollution, drainage problems and debris which would
fall from the structures. '

,, Engineers Make Eggs

Toke Panther Ho/low Leop

BY MONICA A. CIROCCO

The “Pittsburgh 500” and
“Panther Hollow Leap" competi-
tion, Pitt’s answer to the “Indian-
apolis 500" and Evel Knievel,
tested the creativity and ability of
freshmen engineering students
Monday and Tuesday in the Towers
lobby.

Groups of students from Engi-
neering 3, Creative Design, built
small vehicles either externally
powered, such as a giant sling shot,
power located outside the vehicle;
or internally powered, such as a
cart with a model airplane motor,
where the power is located inside
the vehicle. Students competed in
their respective division.

The vehicles or their cargo had to
complete at 500-inch race and soar
off an 11-inch ramp, landing on a
second ramp with cargo--an egg--
intact._- _ _ _ _.

The overall winner in the
“internal” division was the team of

5‘ Jim Brickner, Randy Murchak ahd

Mark Pilant. Their freon gas-

powered cart finished first in both
parts of their division, racing 500
inches in 1.7 seconds and leaping 5
'feet--with egg intact.

The giant sling shot of Tab
Douglas, John Hirko, Walter
Popovski and Dave Sobek propelled

a softball 500 inches in .53 seconds
and shot the ball with an egg in it,
off the ramp, completing a 21 foot
leap. It finished first in both parts,
capturing overall winner in the
“external” division.

The contest was the creation of
Alan Brainard, director of fresh-
man engineering programs, who
also conducted “Engineering
Eggs-periment.”

“I dreamt the ‘Pittsburgh 500’
and ‘Panther Hollow Leap’ Com-
petition .up three weeks ago. It’s
harder than the ‘Eggs-periment’.
The externally-powered vehicles
did better, overall, than those that
were internally powered because
the latter can't get much acceler-
ation. But next time, I think I’m
going to require all internally-
powered vehicles. I don’t like
externally-powered ones.”

Brainard entered his own in-
ternally-powered “Go Turtle" prop
in the contest. It raced 500‘ inches
in 2.49 seconds, but weight
complications prevented it from
completing the leap. ‘

Win or lose. he noted the design
course is very popular with the
students. This was the first year of
the “Pittsburgh 500" and “Pan-
ther Hollow Leap"" Competition,
but it's here to stay.

“I like to think in terms of all
government services being human
services,” said Staisey. “One of
the fixed responsibilities of any
government is to care for the
people under it.”

Staisey said it was difficult for
government people in Washington
to develop programs to meet the
needs of the people in Pittsburgh.
“There are so many deﬁnitions
added to legislation as it is
processed through federal and
state levels that by the time it
reaches the county level programs
have lost much of their relevance.” ‘

Staisey cited Kane Hospital as
the first big step of this county in
the care of its people. “Kane is the
second largest in the country. It
carries 2,200 patients with a
trained staff. The problem is once
you get a needy citizen to Kane,
what does he have to go back to.

“Unfortunately Kane Hospital"
has gained the reputation of being

.a place where you go to spend the

remaining years of your life.”
Staisey said many of the people in
Kane could be in a different,
situation if their children had not
forsaken the responsibility of
caring for their parents.

ren, I don't think they should. All

Staisey listed various programs

Staisey said programs such as
the medical mobile units in Turtle
Creek Valley and the Manpower
program were proving effective.
He said the transfer of the health
department from the city to the
county was a plus for control of the
environment.

Funding of the county’s human
services programs was mentioned
by Staisey as a difficulty.
“Priorities determined by the
accessability of money are not
proper. My view has always been:
if there is a need, we’ll respond,
then we’ll worry about the money.
Staisey said the state has failed to
provide funds for programs created
by its own legislature.

forthcoming Democratic primary
race for the US Senate. Two
newcomers to the statewide elec-

Pete Flaherty--reflect the national
trends in regards to how govern-

It is important that. one analyzes
_ this race in terms of ﬁscal
" conservatism and human services
_ before those basic issues become
clouded by campaign rhetoric.
Those perspectives will undoubt-
- jedly be the guiding light to their
decisions if either Flaherty or
Denenberg reach Washington,
D.C.

Denenberg's career as Insurance
Commissioner can be characterized
as one oriented to consumer and
, human needs. He has been the

V people's tool in attacking the
problems they ‘face in this
business-oriented society. He has
created an awareness of consumer
rights and responsibilities among
i- the public with the publication of
his various “Shopper's Guide.”

Perhaps his greatest accomp-
lishment has been the creation of a_
consumer-oriented Insurance De-
‘ gpartment. He took the regulatory
body of the Insurance Department
, andtransformed it into a nationally
recognized consumer protection
agency. it

Both the Pennsylvania Medical
Society and Association of Trial
Lawyers were so angered by his
stands on issues such as health
care costs and no fault auto
insurance that they both demanded
his immediate dismissal. He justly
has been called “Pennsylvania’s
answer to Ralph Nader” by both
friend and foe alike.

Herb Dennenberg the US Sena-
torial candidate could not be
different from Herb Dennenberg
the Insurance Commissioner. The
man has been too consistent in his
efforts for consumers and human

$120 million and has reduced taxes.
Without raising taxes, he has
improved‘ the efficiency of govern-

He has carefully nutured the

‘image of the -govemment official

who has opposed spending and cut
taxes. Flaherty slashed the payroll
by 1,000 employees, eliminated
budgeted items and abolished the
wage tax with the approval of City
Council.

as a ﬁscal conservative, he has

Legisltii/e Solution  

BY DOUG YAUGER

“Everyone talks about our pro-
blems, but what is anyone doing
about them?" This phrase is’
surely applicable nowadays. when
fast-paced talk is often mistaken for
genuine change. However, it is
pleasing to note this is not always
the case.

There is presently a bill before the
US House of Representatives
which can provide real change in an
area where it is desperately
needed. The problem is rape; the
bill is HR 11519, the “Rape
Prevention and Control Act." It
was introduced by Pittsburgh Con-
gressman John Heinz of the 18th
District, and co-sponsored by over
seventy of his colleagues.

The sheer size of the problem is
overwhelming. In 1973, more than
46.000 forciblerapes were reported
in the United States. A disturbing
revelation in its own right, the
46,000 figure perhaps represents
as little as one-tenth of the total
incidence of rape. To compound
the problem, no less than half of

the men actually prosecuted. are
acquitted or have their case

services in Pittsburgh.

Pete Flaherty, candidate for the
US Senate will be no different from
Pete Flaherty, Mayor of Pitts-
burgh. In his 4‘/2 years as Mayor of
Pittsburgh, he dogmatically main-
tained his image of fiscal account-
ability and governmental effi-
ciency. It is impractical to think
Pete Flaherty would change once
he entered the Senate.

Which one will the people
choose? Denenberg or Flaherty?

In this year of political upheav-
als, it is really too early to make a
solid political prediction for the
race. Will the voter tliihk of the
race in terms of Watergate? The
economy? Fiscal responsibility?
Human Services? _

The campaign rhetoric has not
yet become overwhelming. How-
ever, if “Jimmy the Greek” was
making book on this race, the odds
would probably be 5 to 4 in favor of
Pete.

dismissed. Our society has little or
no means to deal with such a large
dilemma. ‘

The “Rape Prevention and
Control Act" provides for practical
action within the bureaucratic
framework of government. Under
the bill, the Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare (HEW)
would create the National Center
for the Control and Prevention of
Rape as a branch of the National
Institute of Mental Health.

At first glance, this appears to be
a politically-motivated extension of
the already monolithic federal
bureaucracy. However. the bill
transcends such superﬁciality, for
it goes on to provide a concrete
mechanism for the alleviation of
the Droblem.

For instance, after proper evalua-
tion of the problem and the present
means of dealing with it, the bill
would: [1] provide for the develop-
ment of an information clearing-
house with regard to all aspects of
rape, [2] the compilation ' and
publication of training materials for.

American Boycotts:

BY JACK ROMBERG
The writing on the bathroom walls
reads, ‘Boycott McDonalds--they
gave to Nixon's campaign.”

Beneath that is appropriately

scrawled, “Don’t blame me--I eat
at Winky’s.” Thus, the age of the
political hamburger is ushered in
by a call to boycott America's
number one fast food service.
The most significant aspect of this
tidbit of graffiti is not the
appearance of political slogans in
lavatories, butthat a national call
to boycott has been relegated to the.
status of metal latrine doors. This
is directly attributable to the
boycotting craze which is sweeping
the country. True to their history,
Americans are enraptured by this
new fad. Everyone is boycotting
something--from lettuce to Pepsi

L-. -nnuull.

a~ ape

individuals and organizations with
an interest in the treatment of the
problem of rape, and [3] the
transfer of funds from existing
organizations to the Center in order
to provide for a coordinated effort
against the rape problem, as well
as to prevent any bureaucratic
overlapping.

Of greatest importance to the
University community in Oakland,
is the provision which allows the
Secretary of HEW to make grants
to community mental health
centers, non-proﬁt private organi-
zations, and public agencies “for
the purpose of conducting research
and demonstration proiects con-
cerning the control and prevention
of rape."

Perhaps our local institutions will
have a hand in the development of
a solution. Perhaps the walk to
Trees Hall will be safe. These
things are pure speculation. One
thing is certain, however. House

Bill 11519 is a step in the right
direction. ' ’

 

Everybody Does It

Cola. The possibilities are virtually
unlimited.

The grape and wine boycott
currently applies only to Gallo
wine. If the boycott was extended
to include all sacramental wines,
the Catholic Church would be at the
mercy of the migrant grape picker.
There would be a sharp increase in
the demand ‘for imported Portu-
guese Mateuse for religious pur-
poses.

That, however is nothing com-
pared to the potential outcry of
American Jewry if Mogan David
and Maneschewicz were‘ added to
the list. The fund raising proiects
of dozens of temple sisterhoods
would end in one fell swoop.

American. Jews are spearheading
the boycott of Pepsi Cola, the soda

I which is trying to replace vodka as

the national drink in the Soviet
Union. The Soviet government is
concerned about the number of
hours their workers miss by
imbibing in too much Russian
tradition. So, Pepsi Cola is under
‘contract to build a giant factory.

-The boycott of Pepsi Cola is a
potential unifying force for this
fragmented country. Liberals and
Jews who are protesting the
‘treatment of political prisoners will
wholeheartedly _ioin, as will tradi-
tional conservatives who are
convinced any company" which
deals with Russia must be infested
with the Red Peril. Likely, these

people are merely living in their

own wet dream euphoria.

Boycotting is a weapon which
many groups with grievances can
use to great effectiveness. If the
Union of American Indian actors
and stuntment wanted to protest

the misrepresentation of Indians in .

the movies, they could call for a
boycott of all John Wayne
pictures.

Furthermore, they could demand

documented proof that John-

Wayne did indeed conquer the
West. The Duke, conforming to
the nationwide fad, but still
remaining true to his old image,
would star in his next movie as a
teamster gleefully transporting
scab lettuce.

Certain boycotts would be benefi-
cial to the entire country. Many
wheat farmers would like to protest
the sellinglof their produce to the
Soviet Union. They could
effectively do this by declaringa
boycott of all oil products. This
boycott would keep the farmers
from having to transport their grain
to market and deal a powerful blow
to the energy crisis. An offshoot of
this boycott would be populariza-
tion of slogans like “Let them eat
rye.”

Boycotting will reach its pinacle
with the appearance of a National
Boycott Weekly magazine to inform V
all potential boycotters of the type,
time and nature of all available
boycotts. In order to avoid any
tieups in communication, the’

publishers will have to be sure their
, , printersremain off all boycott lists.

Energy

Dear Editor:

A recent article in the Pittsburgh
Press, “Computer Stars in Energy
Forum" described workshops on
energy and the enivronment to be
held soon at Carnegie Mellon
University. “At each of the
workshops there will be an
Energy-Environment Simulator in
which are stored the complex
interrelationships of’ energy con-
sumption environmental effects
and- fuel resource use.” The
Atomic_Energy Commission pro-
grammed the computer, according
to the article. “Workshop
participants will feed their ideas on
how to deal with the nations energy
problems...”

For those of you who play the
energy environment “game” I
suggest you look for three things:
[1] Is the computer programmed to
assume the existence of the
breeder reactor? [2] Does the
computer provide for advances in
solar energy? [3] Does the
computer assume that the United
States has the entire world’s
natural resources at its disposal?

I agree that we need to reduce
consumption and look towards
non-fossil fuel energy sources. I do
not agree those non-fossil energy
sources should be nuclear power.

Mistake

‘ Dear Editor:
lwould like to address myself to _

a letter to the Editor that appeared
in Friday, March 22nd issue of the
Pitt News. The letter dealt with
Student Government’s refusal to

divulge the fee it was to pay Mr.,

Welch, founder of the John Birch
Society. The letter itself was
printed as requested, however,
there was a serious mistake made
on the signatures.

The signatures should have read:
Mark Satinoff, President, Pitt YSA
Fay Snyder, President, UWU

John A Rohe, President Pitt

‘ CYD's*

Bet Nelson, member of CYD's*

TIMES TO REMEMBER
ROSE KENNEDY

 

Dough Yauger, President, CYR’s*
*for identification purposes only.

By not doing so, the Pitt News
has implied organizational support
from the College Young Democrats
and College Young Republicans.
That is definitely not the case in
this instance. Mr. Rohe and Mr.
Yauger agreed with the letter, but
the organizations did not formally
take a stand on the issue.

The second mistake was made by
either Mr. Sa-tinoff or his secretary.
I’ signed the original letter as “Bet
Nelson, member of CYD's" not as
Statewide president of the College
Young Democrats. As President of

' the CYDCP, I cannot take stands on

issues that affect the intragov-
ernment relations on a college
campus. Having served as
Treasurer, Vice President, and
President of the Pitt organization, I
felt that I could take ya stand as a
member of the local club.

Therefore, I felt justified in signing‘

the letter as a member of the local
club, not as Statewide President.

Granted they are seemingly
small errors, but they do affect
local organizations and my position
as State President of the College
Young Democrats of Pennsylvania.
It is imperative as state President
that I do not become involved in
policy stances of the local clubs. It
does not mean however that as an
individual I cannot take stands on
local issues.

Thank you very much for

' ings.

Dear Mr. Zru_st:

Congratulations on your article-

It was long over-due. I'm
sure that many other students and
employees of Pitt agree with your

' To the Editor: .
On March 5 at approximately

l1‘:0O am in the Student Union, we
were stared at, and then followed
around by, an unusual character.

His clothes and hair were ﬁlthy and
bedraggled, and he stunk. For
about half an hour we were stalked
openly by this person from place to
place on the Student Union main
floor. Jan went downstairs to the
Hunt Room to report this‘ to the-
campus police, who informed her

that he is harmless, and although
he is not a student, he is permitted
to remain in the building. The

policeman said that he is trying to

get him into a YMCA work
program, and wanted to keep an
eye on him. (The police were
downstairs; the character was
upstairs.)

While this was happening, the
man pulled up a chair and
pointedly stared at us from about 6
feet away. - Jeff then questioned

him, ‘and he informed us, “This is

my land. You come on my land,
you my deed, and I follow you
around.”

Jan came back,

relieved until we saw his eyes
gleaming at us from behind the
glass of the television room. He
had moved to an out-of-the-way
place to watch us.

All of us then went to complain
again to the police. This time they
reluctantly agreedto ask him to
leave the building. One of them
informed us that the man had been

and the man

We were -

seen wandering through, and had»
been kicked out of, several other _
buildings. (At first we had been if ,-
told he wandered only in the
Union.) Q
When the policeman asked the‘«_._
man to leave, he pointed at Jan‘-1_‘.
from across the room and said, "
“She's the one who reported you.”,, :1
We feel that this man should not 
be allowed to remain. in the”,
building at all- We are not 
convinced of his harmlessness, and f.
he is not a student. We think the

Rose Kennedy’s own story of the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, her busy and full life, and
of the many people she has known. This is a rich book covering the events of over eight
decades, making use of thousands of family letters which add a marvelous authenticity.
Included are over fifty pages of family pictures, almost none of which has ever appeared
in print. It is an unusual memoir because the children—Ted, Eunice Shriver, Patlawford,
lean Smith—have all contributed their versions of various stories. The result is a full and
varied book—candid and beautifully-written.

Rose Kennedy is the daughter of a prominent Boston po

“It would most likely be necessary to take the
entire neighborhood if either lines A or B (alternative
routes) were to be built."

The idea of the Oakland Crosstown Expressway is
certainly not a new one. The SWPRPC’s written
report speculates a similar route through what is now
Oakland was used by Indians during the reign of
Seneca Queen Aliquippa in the middle of the
eighteenth century.

The Expressway was also part of a proposal by the
Pittsburgh Regional Planning Association [PRPA] in
1961 as part of the Oakland Twenty Year
Development Plan under Pittsburgh Mayor Joseph
M. Barr. The route suggested then is nearly
identical to the one proposed by the SWPRPC.

The 1961 proposal was based on traffic studies
done in 1958 by the Pittsburgh Area Transportation

A report by the PRPA made some sixteen years
ago said the traffic circulation through the Oakland
area would be improved by a north-south connection
around the city.

“This highway network should be able to provide
for the volumes of traffic anticipated by 1980 in this
area," the 1961 report states. According to SWPRPC
planner Robert Kochanowski, there is novcorrelation
between the 1961 plan and the ._present CYCLE II
proposal.

“We have made detailed proiections of likely land
use strategies," Kochanowski said, “this plan will
not perpetrate unwanted growth patterns. The 1961
plan didn’t have any funding and SWPRPC is the
official long range planning Agency in this area."

The decision to continue planning the Oakland
Crosstown now moves from the Friday vote into the

V SWPRPC Board for further approval.

“That's up to the commission now," Kochanowski

An agent for the US Bureau of

elaborated: “Such crimes as
prostitution, burglary, and shop-
lifting pay off well and are less
risky than the crimes usually
committed by. say, a speed freak. I
suppose it depends upon the nature
of the drug.
“Crime and addiction are self-

mitted to support a habit. right?

We've found that the people who
are picked up have already been

related crime. But as for saying
that addiction implies a life of
crime, or vice versa, well, God only
knows which came first."

St. Francis Methadone Program
Director Daniel Roberts cited
statistics from the application
forms of addicts which listed arrest
records in a maiority of cases. He
estimated at 75% of the crimes
were non-violent.

purse snatching would probably ‘be

usually not something like armed

According to the Governor’s

useful in making future policy
decisions regarding drug treat-
ment. . . J

“Historically, drug treatment
programs were sold to the public as
a way to eliminate crime. While we
feel those programs do have some
impact on crime, our primary aim
in treatment is to cope with
problems of people. and this study
confirms that it is those problems
that lead to both crime, andlater,
drug addiction."

‘l&F' Takes Patience

Editor’s note: J -P Malocsay, known
to many as simply “Freak,” is an
odd sort of fellow. Dressed at birth

in a ﬂowered shirt, he has yet to-

take it off in public. An instructor
in Pitt’s English Department,
Malocsay is also a close friend of
John Wayne’s. And if still in doubt
as to what phallic implies,
Malocsay would be more than
happy to explain the concept with a
one-word-definiton. My complaint
and request--Ideas and Figures
staff:. don’t pressure me.

BY J -P MALOCSAY V

Everybody knows how English
teacher types regularly appear in
the dim confines of the classroom
to Clank chains and howl, at the
moonless muddled hor/izon of
student literacy--so iust imagine
the surprise of such a critter when
he is handed the 1974 Ideas and
Figures, a student mag bigod, and
finds it very good reading indeed.

Good reading...Now there's a
phrase would tempt one to a
sermon, but never mind. If, Gentle
Reader, you can read; and -if you
want_some notion of the kind of
writing being done hereabouts;
and, perhaps most importantly, if
you want to- know what Pitt
students themselves would choose
to publish, then pick up a copy of
Ideas and Figures, retire with it to
yon corner, and (if you're one of my
darling students) eat yer heart out
passim. _

There are, of course, a few things

one has to remember in order to-

appreciate this kind of publication.

First, there’s the pleasure prin-
ciple. Don’t look for the orgasmic
contented aftermath you get from
[ho hum] great literature: these
are journeyman writers yet. But do
look for the perky, and occasionally
impressive, moments when a

writer has the guts to imitate some '

master’s mode and pull it off.

If, for example, you »don’t find
good moments in “Blue into Red”
in this issue of I&F, chances are
you haven’t been patient enough

-to treat
emotions seriously, and in public,

with Joyce or Burroughs either; or
maybe you think good writing
doesn’t begin with good imitation.

Similarly, it helps to cultivate a
sort of pornographic sympathy with
the fact that people in your
immediate vicinity, people as yet
unembalmed in books, are moved
their thoughts and

through the difficult and embar-
rassingly risky medium of the
written word.

It may well _be that writing
teachers, professional nags like
me, will be the ones who appreciate

" the quality of editing in this issue of

Ideas and Figures. It is the fault of
student publications -generally to
study egotism more than excel-
lence; here, however, there’s very
little evidence of clique support for
weaksister writing. This is
important because collegiate edi-
tors and writers inevitably support
one another, if they don’t in fact
play both roles.

If you think such coincidences
aren’t symptomatic of an existen-
tial calamity, try this little
experiment: write a reasonably
good piece of prose or poetry; then
go out and look for somebody who,
unfee’d, will thank you for your
trouble.

There are, of course, plenty of ~

trouble spots in the writing‘ here
that teacher/ editors [as opposed to
student/editors] might not have
passed on into print, but every
writer/ editor worth his salt knows
how little timezis required for
conscience itself to take up the
slack, so amen to that._

I must apologize to the writers and

editors of Ideas and Figures for

praising their work this generally.
My theory (guaranteed the last) is
that the prurient barnacle of
criticism ought to attach itself to
ships riding anchor in the
classroom. or in danger of floating
farther out to sea ' than this
year’s-—let’s say excellently rea
dcable--Ideas and Figures. » ‘

O

It is fairly well known by now,
that, in the ﬁeld of sports, Pitt has

‘I L produced some outstanding teams

this year. Unbeknownst to many,
however, are the numerous accom-
plishments in the field of music,
that have brought the Heinz Chapel
Concert Choir to its present place
ofrecognition. The choir has faced
several difficult assignments this
season, but under the direction of
conductor Don Franklin, it has
retained its traditional high stan-

I dards of performance.

Highlighting this year’s achieve-
ments was the Baroque Opera
American Premiere of Rameau’s
Castor and Pollux, performed in
collaboration with the Ohio State
Baroque Dance Ensemble, and
the chamber orchestra [composed
of members of the college
community]. S Hande|’s Acis and
Galatea rounded out the all-Ba-
roque program, which was taken on
tour to Oberlin and OSU with great
success.

The choir added to the joy of the
hohday
Christmas concerts, including the
Chancellor's reception and tele-
visions appearances on WIIC and

~WTAE.

The main effort, before the
holidays, went into the recording

'and printing of the choir’s first

album. Music for the Christmas
Season contains traditional and
modern carols, the motet “Quem
Vidistis,” the Gloria from
Hayden’s Heligmesse, and selec-
tions from Bach’s
Oratorio.

For the Winter Term; the choir's
repertoire spanned the entire
spectrum of music, from Renais-

season with numerous _

Christmas ‘

\ Choir Climoxes Season

sance to Twentieth Century avant-
garde. As an added attr_action to
the Medieval Festival at Carnegie
Museum, the choir staged the
medieval play, Son of Getron, later
broadcast over WQED radio. In
contrast to this was the choir’s
rendition of Much, an electronic
piece for choir" and tape that was
supervised by the co-composers, R.

Morris from Yale, and W. Slawson

from Pitt.

Other performances included the
annual Winter Term Concert,
featuring Debussy‘s Trois Chan-
sons and Britton's Hymn to St.
Cecilia, and a special concert at the
Butler Performing Arts Series.

The choir plans to close the season
with a spring tour to Europe.
Funding for the trip came from
many sources, including several
extra concerts for such occasions as
the 25th Anniversary of the United
Nations of Pittsburgh, and the
Commemorative Service for Viet-
nam Veterans. ' In all, forty
members of the choir, accompanied
by Don Franklin and Svina S.
Skewis, expect to make the trip.

Stops on the tour include the
prestigious St. Martins in the
Fields’ Noon Hour Concert series
near Trafalgar Square in London,
an exchange concert with Trinity
College Cambridge, and a perfor-
mance at the University of
Pittsburgh extension at Rouen,
France; also a concert at Saint
Severin on the left bank in Paris,
the Oratory in Rome, an audience

’ with the Pope, and an invitation

from the American Consolate in
Florence to sing at the music
festival at Prato, Italy.

The choir may not dribble a good

e.a’lured at -Manor

BY M.C. PILECKI

.- May/September love affairs are
hardly new in screen fiction, and
simply a matter of course when the
younger partner is female and the
older is male. For generations
~. many young women have been cast
I as leading ladies to men older than
their fathers, and the situation is
-hardly one for raised eyebrows.

I And the touch of having the two
lovers coming from very different
‘backgrounds is hardly innovative
‘either. So Breezy, the story of a
‘young counter culture woman and a
.middle-aged upper-middle-class
real estate salesman falling in love,

 

1$age.1o ’PITTN’EWS—Wedne’sday, Mai-(31.27, 1974

is no great milestone in the history
of cinema.

But Breezy is less the old love
story than-a male sexual fantasy
with a few neat embellishments to
keep the story together. In this
case, the fantasies seem to belong
to director Clint Eastwood--who
has already proven his machismo in
previous acting and directing
iaunts--rather than screenwriter Jo
Helms, whose script is an ordinary
love story.

The story concerns divorced,
fairly well-to-do Frank (William
Holden), who alternates casual
affairs with one steady, and

- "  \.~'_~:.~.>—.,¢s;,~.:rr-:;,..-_.  '  v ‘ ‘ ‘

 

tolerates no holds on him from
women. Just as his regular affair is
breaking up (she's getting mar-
ried), he meets up with a very
attractive female hippie.

She is iust bubbling over with
love, telling him what a nice guy he
is even when he's clearly a bastard,
and blithely imposing herself on
him, generally forcing her friend-
ship. She urges him to make love,
and when they finally start their

affair, she never asks anything,

from him, not even that he return
the love she asks permission to
give. His only hassle is the
sometimes upsetting ‘age differ-

ence, which should hardly be a
problem for him. I
lt’s the perfect setup for the
overage male: an open bed with
absolutely no strings attached.
And the woman involved is as
wispy as the name she affects. Kay
Lenz, as Breezy, certainly looks the
part of personified hippie-type
love, goodness, etc., with no more
depth allowed than what would
make her attractive to men.
There were some possibilities for
character development. Breezy
has a friend to whom she describes,
more symbolically than realisti-
cally, her new lover, but it's never

,i‘Breezy': Director Eastwood's Sexual Fantasy  s

allowed to gel. In her vague, yet
colorful descriptions, it’s never
established whether she's really
evading the question of who she’s
sleeping with or just letting her
mind wander. Or what. Another
ﬂeeting look into Breezy’s.,charac-
ter is when she bids hello to a
young stud (whose bed she shared
early in the flick), and he has. no
recollection of her.
This is a chick who has cle_arl_y
been tossed around by men for
their own use, but
accepts it and asks for more. At the
film's beginning she /is hitchhiking,
and picked up by a middle class
dude who wants to rape her. She
gets away, and flees to Frank’s car.
She explains what happens, and
says she knows she's crazy for
iumping into another stranger’s
car. But, she says, she has a belief
in the goodness of men; besides,
she says, Frank's better looking.
This is about as far as her
character is allowed to go, with no
rhyme or reason. ‘With no
structure behind her, no depth, she
seems more a candidate for
psychological help. Certainly this
is past the era of the -“flower
child,” but even they ﬁnally found_
out the .world
whipped cream. Breezy “never
stops trusting, ‘loving, caring,
giving, etc. -
Breezy certainly is no upleasant
movie to watch, it iust has that fault
of lack of character. Eastwood has

filled his third movie with lush '

scenery and sets, and again uses a
romantic musical interlude to
weave the two characters together,
iust as he did with his ﬁrst effort
Play Misty For Me.

William Holden is the best
choice for the man who finds a new
life with a new woman. His.
rubbery face and molten eyes can
portray the; tenderest of emotions

-1 without ‘V-forsaking the visage ‘of
' masculinity.

And Kay Lenz, as
stated, "is freshly vibrant and
sensually free, if a bit too absolute
in showing sadness, _ioy, love, etc.

The film is too wordy, ‘with the
characters drifting into philo-
sophical monologues and wishful

I thinking. But it's a pleasant story

that, if not overly‘ original, is

uplifting and neatly tied at the end.»

PS: To my mysterious letter-
writer and others who may have
been wondering about the I Love‘
You Rosa review. I was certainly
aware that the movie was originally
in Hebrew, as it was thatversion
which I saw and reviewed. The
theatre manager told me‘ the
subtitled film was not doing well at
the box office and would be
replaced by a dubbed version.

Somehow there was a misprint
which said the “dubbed version”
“was not doing well, certainly not
what I intended to say since the
English-language movie hadn't
even opened when I wrote the
review. But whether it was my own
slip or one at the printer's I
apologize for any misconception
caused by the appearance of the
wrong word.

Studio Theatre is presenting the
play “La Ronde", March 28, 29
and 30 at 8:30 pm. No reservations
are required, admission $1.00. For
more information call X6587.

Record Review ‘

Paul Simon

BY BRUCE IRVING

Paul Simon In Concert: Live
Rhymin’ contains eleven previously
recorded Paul Simon songs pro-
viding a balanced picture of a man
with diverse musical interests and
inﬂuences. It represents the last
stage in his transition from Paul
Simon, late of Simon andzGarfunkel

to Paul Simon, artist and per-
former. The experimental feel of
_the first two solo albums is

gone--Simon is comfortably at
home in a musical‘ atmosphere
light--years from Simon and
Garfunkel and every bit as
satisfying.

Every periodof Simon’s work

and at least three of his major 

influences are solidly represented
in this album." He opens with a
short solo set, featuring only his
acoustic guitar. The most notable
performance here is “Homeward
Bound,” a road song in the best
tradition of American urban folk
music. '

Written in the early sixties (while
Simon was a follower of the New
York scene that spawned Dylan et
al), “Homeward Bound” was one

E of Simon and Garfunkel’s early

‘.6

 

hits. The typically clean guitar
work stands out here, and Simon’s
vocal is surprisingly fresh; one

subtle new arrangement of"‘The
Boxer." The exotic‘-sounding
Peruvian instruments provide a
flowing, almost eerie backdrop for
Simon’s less restrained voice,
allowing him to place greater vocal
emphasis on the lyrics. The
absence of Garfunkel's close
harmonies contributes still more to
this vocal freedom, a fact clearly
demonstrated throughout the al-
bum. I

The piano arrangement on the
original “Bridge Over Troubled
Water” was the first indication of
the influence‘ of gospel music on
Paul Simon and, judging from side
two of Live Rhymin’, it remains an
important aspect of his music. The
Jessy Dixon Singers provide solid,
gospel-style backing for four of his
best-known songs.

Most notable among these is
“The Sound of Silence," featuring
a totally new arrangement. The
Singers’ rich harmonies dominate
the arrangement‘ andxsolo verses by
Simon and Dixon punctuate it.
Dixon's solo is particularly effec-
tive; he sings: “And in the naked
light I saw ten-thousand people,
maybe more..." and transforms
Sin1on’s early sixties social com-
mentary into a moving plea for
humanity in the seventies.

The conflict between the Student Government and the Athletic
Department concerning the ﬁnancial backing of the Pitt Hockey Club
reached its peak ‘and ground to another stalemate in Casmir
Myslinski‘s office yesterday morning.

As was fully expected by this reporter and Student Government
President Mike Furick. who attended the meeting along with another
member of SG and another representative of the Hockey,Club,
Myslinski flatly refused to fund the Club. -

‘Those reasons that had seemed so obvious. the lack of an ice skating
rink on campus etc., were not the only basis the Athletic Director used
in his argument.

As“iMyslinski stated, if the Athletic Department decides to make

lllllllllllllllllllIllllidlllllllllllllllllllllllllll " .

. hockey a varsity sport it must take over FULL control of the Club’s

finances. Furick stated that Student Government could not afford the
price to keep the Hockey Club progressing as it should. Myslinski

A claimed that the Athletic Department couldn’t handle the bill either.

But when-l speak of the Club's finances. those ﬁgures must be dealt
with in two separate lights--once in regard to Student Government
backing the Club and the other if the sport is made varsity.

First of all, the Club submitted an allocation request to Student

' Government in February asking for approximately $13,000. Naturally
‘ the idea with that figure was it would immediately be cut down by the

Allocations Committee. which it was. No way did the Club expect to

get by SG with that amount in full.

The, request included allocations for new equipment, league dues,
practice ice time, game ice time and travel expenses for some exhibiton
games on the road [the Club could afford but one last season.]

The main concern of the Club was the area of practice ice time. For
the caliber of talent to improve. it is imperative that the Club skate
more than the twice-weekly sessions they had this year. Skating is the
name of the game and it's only natural, the more you skate the better
you’ll become. I

But when Myslinski talks about making hockey a varsity sport--look
out. The figures to operate a varsity hockey team, competing iust on
the local level. are far above what the Club requested from Student
Government. i

Myslinski’s ﬂat refusal was also based on the fact that if he did turn
the sport varsity, ﬁnancial backing would include not only what was

-A mentioned as the Club’s allocation request, but thousands of dollars

more.

Any varsity sport is under full control, ﬁnancially. of the Athletic
Department. Since Pitt is a member of the NCAA, it is bound to
maintain all varsity sports under NCAA regulations.

Those generally include in regard to the hockey situation: if no

‘practice facilities exist on campus and it is necessary for the

participants to travel a considerable distance to the facilities, then the
University must provide their transportation. All participants must be

ankle. a handful of broken noses, caritlage damage to one skater’s
knee, and countless number of stitches.) For full insurance, right now
the Club has over 40 members on its general roster, the bill suddenly
leaps skyward. Add the fact that the more practices held, more iniuries
will occur.

With varsity status, even though not competing at first in the
standard NCAA or ECAC divisions, the hockey team would have to
expand its schedule to play better competition. Add more money for
travel and home ice expenses.

ln other words, the Athletic Department can't give the Hockey Club
$6,000 and then iust let them go back into the WPIHA and that's that.

director, read an-opening state-
ment at the first bargaining session
in which he charged owners with
perpetuating as uniust system of
control over athletes, supressing
the constitutional rights of players
and with a general disregard fo the
players’ union. '

The players have threatened to
strike if most of their demands are
not met, possibly affecting the start
of the pre-season schedule.

The players have demanded, in
addition to limiting Rozelle’s
powers, the elimination of the
option clause, waiver system, all
ﬁnes, reserve lists and training
camp curfews.

They also are seeking the right to
cancel trades, shorter training

, camps and a moratorium on further

installation of synthetic turf.
Financially, the players want to
increase their minimum salary

"from $12,000 to $25,000‘ for

veterans and to $20,000 for rookies,
a $25,000 bonus for winning the
Super Bowl and $20,000 for losing;
$15,000 or three game checks for
participating in conference title
games; $5,000 or two game checks
for playoff games, and a general
increase in preseason game pay, up
to $7,000 a game.

The players association was
piqued at the first meeting because
the owners refused to pay player
insurance premiums, some $64,000
monthly, after April 1 unless the
players guarantee that there will be
no strike until, at least, the start of
the regular season schedule.

Garvey termed the action “bad

Lonborg Primes For ’74  

CLEARWATER, FLA. AP--Jim
Lonborg says that, in a sense, his
switch from the American League
to the National last season was like
going from high school to college.

“Not from the standpoint of a
difference between leagues,” Lon-
borg explained, ‘.‘but from the
difference in personnel. There

Reed Sets For Annual
Pre-playoff Comeback  

NEW YORK AP--The road to
recovery is a familiar one to Willis
Reed.

‘The 6-foot-10 center for the
National Basketball Association's
New York Knicks has been
recovering for the better part of
three years, ﬁrst from tendonitis in
his left knee, now from torn
cartilage in his right knee.

“I haven’t set a timetable for my
recovery,” said the big 240-pound-
er, who now is wearing a heavy
brace on his right knee.

“That’s something you can’t
plan. I just keep working and
things _iust happen. It all depends
on the situation too--how well I
play, how much I play.”

Reed missed all but 11 games of
the 1971-72 season with the _ﬁrst
knee injury and ﬁnally battled back
during the 1972-73 season to 100
per cent. He was named the Most
Valuable Player of the champion-

ship series with Los Angeles, which
the Knicks won.

But last Nov. 25 the other knee
went, surgery was performed Dec.
12, and the 31-year-old graduate of
Grambling has been struggling to
return ever since. His first game
was last week in Phoenix. Then he
played 13 minutes in New York
against Kansas City-Omaha on
Saturday night, scoring two points
in a losing cause.-

“My offense has suffered the

v most,” Reed said after that game.

“You lose a little in your defensive

positioning, but still it’s the offense ,

that suffers the most. A
“Physically, I’m in shape, and
I’m not having any problems
mentally...with my concentration
or anything. It's iust that when ‘I
get out there, things don't seem to
go as well as they used to.”

how to pitch to.

“I’m not an overpowering
pitcher," Lonborg continues. “I
depend on the location of my
pitches, a thorough knowledge of
the hitter‘s weakness. It took me
an entire season to learn about
National League hitters.”

The 30-year-old Lonborg adds
that a mechanical defect in his
pitching and a bad spring training
compounded his learning exper-
ience.

“I iust wasn't throwing the way I
wanted to,”' said the right-hander
who won the Cy ‘Young Award in
1967 as the best pitcher in the
American League.’ The following
winter he broke a leg skiing and
has struggled ever since to regain
his form.

Lonborg posted a 13-16 record
last year in his first season with the
Philadelphia Phillies. His earned-
run average was 4.88, highest since
his 1971 season at Boston. His
early troubles last season led to the
bullpen for a brief spell. He
returned’ to the starting rotation
June 19 and from then on was the
Phils’ biggest winner.

Lonborg and his wife, Mary, took
a vacation after the season, a
9,000-mile trip through California
and Mexico. Then he returned
to his Boston home to prepare for
the 1974 season. He went through
a conditioning program so he'd be

ready to go to Florida and do the
things he wanted to do in spring

training. ' .

“I don't want to sound cocky,”
said the 6-foot-5 Lonborg before a
spring workout here, “but I’m very
confident.‘ I’m certain my
education last year will make
things easier this season. I think
I’m intelligent enough to apply the
things I've learned to game
situations. I have to improve.”

Lonborg listed three things" that

he said should enable him to be a _ _i if

.500 or better pitcher in 1974-better
condition, mechanical perfection
and knowledge of the hitters. His

mechanical problem involved tim-- ’ .
He was throwing.'f._ $13.0
more with his arm and shoulder, '

ing, he said.

failing to make use of all his
physical“ facilities.

Will Lonborg be satisfied with a
.500 pitching season? "‘I really
would,” he said. “When people
talk about a .500 pitcher it

shouldn’t be negative. Look at the ,
statistics. Most pitchers are right ’ if 

around .500,
superstars.
“There are a lot of circumstances

except the real

involved in winning and losing. A‘

pitcher can lose a lot of close games
and have an excellent earned-run
average. Does that make him any
less than the guy who has a good
season, a much higher ERA,.but
his team scored lotsof ‘runs? The
won-lost record can be deceiving.”

the playoffs go, the better it will be
for me. I'll get better as the series

Whether he starts in the playoffs,

  Nicklaus Returning For 

New Orleans Tourney

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.
AP--Johnny Miller, pro golf's
hottest property, was assessing his
chances in this week's Greater New
Orleans Open. ‘

“I'm gonna try to win again,"

said Miller, 26. already the winner
of four titles and almost $150,000
this season.

“I'm playing real good
now. I don't see why I can't win
another one."

Then he paused a moment,
boyish" grin and
continued:

“But I’m not predicting I’m
gonna win. Not at all. ‘I’m not
saying that. .

“Cause Jack will be-back." Jack '

Nicklaus, who was among the
missing when Miller scored his
wire-to-wire triumph in the presti-
gious Sea Pines Heritage Classic
last weekend, will defend his title
in New Orleans this week.

“I'm not nearly as good as he

. him

right‘

is," insisted Miller, who has been
the sensation of the pro tour since
his record 63 in the last round won
the United States Open
championship last June. A

Since then he’s taken titles in
France and Spain, was second in
the British Open and this year
scored a record sweep of the first
three titles of the season before
winning the prestigious Heritage
for the second time.

“If Nicklaus is playing his best
and I'm playing my best, I couldn't
get a sniff of him," he said.

“When I've won 10 more maior
titles and he’s 45, then maybe I'll
say I'm better than he is."

The inevitable comparisons with
the game’s great names please‘ and
annoy him at the same time.

“Through my first four years on
the tour, I had steady improvement
each year. My money winnings

went up eachyear. I moved up one
step on the ladder each time. _

“Then, all of a sudden, it's like I

“I didn't want to do that. Of
course, I want to keep on improving
too. I want to keep on moving up
the ladder, not jump up there and
then slide back."

BY DAVE O’HARA
AP Sports Writer

WINTER HAVEN, Fla. AP--
Shortstop Luis Aparicio and slug-
ger Orlando Cepeda were released
outright by the Boston Red Sox
Tuesday in surprise moves by new
manager Darrell Johnson.

Aparicio, who will be 40 next
month, is an ' 18-year. American
League veteran.

“I've decided to go with our two
young shortstops Rick Burleson
and Mario Guerrero” Johnson
said. “It’s tough for a first year
manager to cut a Hall of Famer
such as Luis. ‘I hope he can catch
on with another club.”

Cepedahit 348 home runs for the \
Louis \

San Franciso Giants, St.
Cardinals and Atlanta Braves
before joining the Red Sox last
year, with the adoption of the
designated hitter rule. E
Johnson said that in Cep,eda’s
case—-as with Aparicio--he had

decided to “keep more of these
young people around._"

Aparicio is one of baseball's
all-time‘ great shortstops. In 18
seasons, he has 2,677 hits and has
played in 2,559 games--tops for
maior league shortstops. He ranks
26th among the all-time base
stealers with 506. '

Burleson, 22, is an outstanding
fielder who helped Johnson win the
Little World Series with Pawtucket
last season. Guerrero batted .233

. as a reserve in his rookie season in

1973.

Cepeda, 36, appeared to be
washed up as a maior league player
after several knee operations.
However with the American
League adoption of the designated
hitter rule, he caught on with the
Red Sox. He‘ hit .289 with 20 home
runs and 86 runs batted in 142
games for Boston last year..

J Johnson said that he will use a
combination of players as the

. designated hitter. I

Webster College MVP

BALTIMORE AP--Marvin Web-
ster, the 7-foot center of Morgan
State’s college division basketball
champions, said Tuesday his being
named Associated Press College
Division Player of the Year was a

-. thrill--for a number of reasons.

“When I came here, I didn't set
any goals for myself or the team,"
the lean iunior, dubbed the
“Human Eraser," said.‘

“I was trying to build Morgan’s
basketball program up. I kneiv if I
played well itwould improve. ‘I
guess the_ award means that’s
happened. "‘

“I also like the personal
recognition. I’d be lying ifl said I

"didn't. ‘I think I work hard, and this

is a nice reward for that work.”
Webster, who led the Bears to
the title in their first appearance in
the Naitonal Collegiate ‘Athletic
Association college division tourn-
ament, was a lopsided winner in
the balloting of sports writers and
broadcasters across the-nation.

Webster received 63 ballots in
the "AP voting. West Georgia’s
Clarence “Foots” Walker was a
distant second with 18 votes,
followed by Leonard Robinson of
Tennessee State with 17. ,.

A product of Baltimore’s Ed-
mondson High School, Webster
averaged 21.4 points and led the
NCAA college division with 22.4
rebounds a game this season. He
also blocked 249 shots.

He was named Most Valuable

Player in the Mid-Eastern Athletic-

Conference and paced Morgan to a
mid-season victory over Maryland-
Eastern Shore, a game that
snapped the Hawks’ ’ 20-game
winning streak‘. .
Webster scored 21 points and
hauled down 16 rebounds in the
NCAA college division title game
against Southwest Missouri and
