Vuono speaks

By Russ Krebs
Staff Writer

She may have lost the
Allegheny County
Commissioner’s race, but
Coleen Vuono is still
plugging for the party
that was too old-fash-

1 ioned to elect her.

In fact, she is already
another
Democratic nomination.
This time, it is for state
representative.

Vuono discussed the
state of Allegheny

University Democrats
meeting. She said the
structure of the
Democratic Party is part
of the reason she lost.

“The Allegheny County
Democratic Party is a
party not ofloyalty, but
one where everyone is
looking out for their own
interest,” said Vuono.

She said that if you
want to run for office in
this county as a
Democrat, don’t count on
the Democratic commit-
tee people to help you
out.

create your own organi-
zation to run.”

According to Vuono,
no real leadership exists
within the current party
structure. Without good
leadership, the party will
continue to suffer losses.

Vuono also stated the
problem that this isn’.t the
strong Democratic Party
of yesteryear.

“People aren’t loyal to
the party anymore [and]
candidates are running
unendorsed.”

Another problem she

brought up is that the A

Transplantation
chair to bear name

of famed Pitt
surgeon

By Joe Wright
and Mark Gordon
The Pitt News

The accolades and accomplishments
continue to pile up for one of the most
respected members of the Pitt commu-
nity, transplant expert Thomas Starzl.

Last week the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center completed a

push to raise $1.5 million to endow a
professorship in honor of Dr. Starzl.

A transplant surgeon for over 30
years, Dr. Starzl performed the world’s
first liver transplant in 1963 at the
University of Colorado. He has been on
the Pitt faculty since 1981, and since
1990 he has been director of the
Transplantation Institute. This post has
allowed Starzl to devote his full atten-
tion to medical research.

“Dr. Starzl is a brilliant man whose
vision has and will continue to benefit
medical science and clinical practice.”
Dr. Thomas Detre, Pitt’s senior vice
chancellor for health sciences, said in a
written statement.

The Starzl Chair will not be held by
Starzl himself. Rather, the chair will be

A pair of
writers sees
trial in block
and white

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

During the long months of the O.J
Simpson double murder trial one of
Pitt’s 1973 alumni, Dennis
Schatzman, now a 20-year veteran
journalist, shared a seat in the third
row of the courtroom.

Because "of the high demand for
seats by the media and the limited
number available, Schatzman was to
share seat C-12 with Tom Elias, a
journalist of 35 years. The two would
alternate hours or days in the seat
watching the trial. Schatzman,
African American, and Elias, white,
would see the trial from exactly the
same vantage point in the courtroom,
yet would emerge with two opposed
views on the case. _

Since the verdict, the two have
written a book, “The Simpson Trial
in Black and White,” and will give a
lecture on Friday at 3 p.m. in 324
Cathedral of Learning.

The book dissects the case by

dividing it into topics which include‘

the verdict, the crime, the jury, the
evidence and the LAPD, among oth-
ers. Each section is divided into two
parts, with each journalist giving his
perspectives. _

By February 1995, not even a
month after the trial began, Elias said
the polls were already showing that
65 percent of whites believed
Simpson was guilty while 65 percent
of blacks believed he was not. As
this stark division down racial lines
continued to intensify, Schatzman
and Elias themselves realized they
themselves represented the division.
They saw the case from the same
seat; America saw it from the same
camera angle.

“We saw everything from the same
spot,” Elias said, “but saw very dif-

PH! slucleni samples Dublin, Guinness-

By Katie Delaney
For The Pitt News

(Editor’s note: This is the third
part of an occasional series
about the author’s fall semester
in Ireland.)

There’s something anticlimac-
tic about ﬁnally touching ground
in a foreign country after looking
forward to the experience for
three years. My ﬁrst impression
of Ireland was nothing spectacu-
lar. Yes, it’s lush green land, but
it reminds me of the same gen-
tly-rolling countryside I’m
accustom to in south—central
Pennsylvania, cows included.
I’m not quite sure what I expect-
ed from the scenery, but I didn’t
think I’d feel like I was driving

’ near Carlisle on the Pennsylvania
Turnpike.

I figured a little disappoint-
ment was nothing that some
good Irish stout couldn’t cure.
After all, it was time to immerse
myself in this new culture, and
the entire world knows that Irish
culture begins with beer. But you
have to earn your drink here, and
the challenge lies in finding a
pub that doesn’t already have a
queue out the door, down the

road, and around the comer at 9
p.m.

Unless you’ve been to Ireland,

shock, and what could be better
than searching for the rock group
U2’s pub called the Kitchen? So
we’re walking around a section
of Dublin called Temple Bar,
where there’s a whole strip of

pubs, nightclubs and restaurants. '

I’d been told (by an American)
that the Kitchen was in that
vicinity, but we searched to no
avail. Certainly the logical thing

and two togeth-
er. Did I ask where a toilet was
when I thought I asked for U2’s
pub, the Kitchen? There was def-
initely no parallel there, at least
not in the American culture, so
we kept walking.

was laughing too hard and slur-
ring too much to be trusted. We
never did ﬁnd the Kitchen that
night, and I haven’t looked for it
since. I needed a bit of recovery
time to calm my frustration, but
it’s still on my list of things to do.

Despite our fruitless journey
through the Temple Bar, I did
have my first Guinness the night
I arrived in Dublin. We found
some nasty bar that had one
redeeming quality: It was only
one block from the hostel where
we were staying for our three-
day orientation. Several lads sit-
ting on the bar stools greeted us
with gazes and a few smirks
when we walked through the
door

The bartender said something
like “the Yanks are here!” We
each gave him our £2 in
exchange for a pint of the thick,
black beer. After my ﬁrst gulp I
realized why they say that drink-
ing Guinness (and liking it) is an
acquired taste. Let’s just say I
don’t think my three-and—a-half
months in Ireland is long enough
to develop a liking for it. Then
again, you never know. Good
things come to those who wait.

Democratic Party is operat-
ing in the red locally.

“We need to hire a profes-
sional fundraiser,” she said.
“You can’t have power with-
out money.”

However, Vuono also said
the fundraiser must be will-
ing to work with the candi-
dates for it to help.

Pennsylvania ranks among
the lowest of states among
women voter turnout, and
the majority of voters that do
turnout are over the age of
50. This is another problem
that Vuono feels is affecting
the Democratic Party.

“Pennsylvania has no sup-

.port from women’s organiza-

tions of female candidates,”
she said.

She feels that the old-fash-
ioned nature of the
Democratic Party is why she
lost in the commissioner’s
race.

The Democratic Party
seems to be the only one that
is old-fashioned. They have
no females in Harrisburg,
while the Republicans do.
Vuono feels this is a big
problem.

According to Vuono, if
these problems aren’t reme-
died, the Democratic Party in
Allegheny County will never

ful status it once had.

ferent trials. Just like the rest
of America.”

Schatzman believes the trial
lacked enough evidence to
convict Simpson and con-
demns the treatment of the
black man in the court sys-
tems. Elias is convinced
Simpson is guilty and identi-
fied with the long-time victim
of domestic abuse Nicole
Brown Simpson. Elias pitched
the book idea to Schatzman
the day after the trial ended to
examine why blacks and
whites have come to see the
case so differently.

Schatzman, who graduated
from Pitt with a specialized
degree in labor history and
was a member of the track
team, the Black Action
Society and a brother of the
Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity,
became one of the most inter-
viewed members of the press
during the Simpson trial. His
television appearances includ-
ed “48 Hours,” “Geraldo,”
“AM Philadelphia,”
“Entertainment Tonight” and
the “Today” show.

Schatzman, the first execu-
tive director of the National
Association of Black
Journalists, is a veteran writer
of black-owned specialized
newspapers, including The
New Pittsburgh Courier. His
coverage of the Simpson trial
was for the Los Angeles
Sentinel, one of the voices of
the African-American popula-

, tion of Los Angeles county.

“A lot of people could not
wait for the Sentinel to come
out to hear what we had to
say,” Schatzman said. “People
were starved for an African-
American perspective.”

Schatzman has had experi-
ence with what he calls the
“criminal law system,” which
he refuses to call a “justice”
system. When he was a young
boy, he and a white boy got
into a fight. When the police
were called to break it up, the
white boy walked away while
Schatzman was taken down-
town and slapped by the
police.

Aside from this and other
personal experiences with the
‘law, which he inserts through-
out the book, Schatzman
served two years as district
judge for Homewood,
Pennsylvania’s. 13th district.

“I had the experience to sit
high and look 1ow,”
Schatzman said.-

His experience with how
the law treats black men tells
him why this case became a
race issue.

“Anytime a black person is
accused of doing anything to

a white person, race enters .

into it,” Schatzman said.
Schatzman cites the Los
Angeles Police Department’s

. treatment of Simpson before

he was even named a suspect.
Simpson was handcuffed
upon returning to‘ Los
Angeles from Chicago imme-
diately following the news of
his wife’s murder, despite not
even being named a suspect.

Schatzman asked David
Gascon, then commander and
now deputy police chief of
the LAPD, why Simpsonhad
been handcuffed. “That was a
mistake,” Schatzman quoted
Gascon as saying in his book.

Schatzman doesn’t believe
that.

“This is policy. Unwritten
policy,” he told The Pitt
News. “This trial really was a
lesson in policy especially
against blacks, whether rich

Trial

0From page 5

Pulitzer Prize in distinguished
commentary and recently
ended a 15-year run as a jour-
nalist for the Scripps—Howard
News Service, for’ which he
covered the Simpson trial.
. “I’ve interviewed everyone
from God to the devil,” Elias
said in jest about his years of
experience.

Despite his years in the
field, which included the cov-
erage of the Charles Manson
trial, he said this was the first
major story he did not want to
take.

“It pushed a lot of my per-
sonal buttons,” Elias said.
“The story literally turned my
stomach.”

Elias said he feels he was
personally able to relate to the
fear that Nicole Brown
Simpson lived with while
dealing with an abusive hus-
band, documented by her var-
ious 9ll calls to the police.
As a child, Elias said his
brother, three years older than
him, had an unpredictable
temper that was always
directed at Elias. Elias said he
often served as a punching
bag for his older brother. His
parents, unable to control the
older brother's temper, did lit-
tle to stop the violence.

Elias said he knows what
it’s like to live in a house with
someone who beats you, but
who you also continue to
love. He also knows what it’s
like to cry out for help to an
authority figure, but get little
support. In this he aligns him-
self with Nicole Brown
Simpson.

Elias opposes Schatzman’s
view that this was a race case.

“I did not think this was a
race case,” Elias said. “This
was a crime of passion. That’s
not race.”

He describes Simpson as a
bully and a spoiled athlete
who was used to getting what
he wanted, when he wanted it.

Race only came up when
the defense played the race
card, but they could only do
that with the help ofthe
LAPD’s reputation for brutal-
ity and discrimination.

“They played the race
card,” Elias said, “but they
couldn’t have done it if they
hadn’t had the material.”

Elias said throughout the
trial he learned to appreciate
the African-American opin-
ion. With the help of
Schatzman he wrote an article
investigating the black per-
spective.

“I ended up with a story
that surprised Dennis
[Schatzman],” Elias said. “He
didn’t think a white person
could write a story that told
the black side.”

Elias said what has caused
this racial divide is the funda-
mental difference of each
race’s experience with the
police.

“Blacks have a fundamental
distrust for the police,” Elias
said. “Whites think when they
[the police] arrest someone,
the person was wrong.”

i Opinions  

Bad move, _Penn State

P-E-N-N-S-T SUCKS.

It’s that simple. And if you’ve ever been to a Pitt sporting event
you’ve probably chanted that, with some help from the Pitt band.

Because all Pitt students know that Penn State sucks.

That’s even more true today, now that Penn State has apparent-
ly killed the Pitt - Penn State football series.

The Pitt - Penn State rivalry is a shining example of what col-
lege sports is all about. Two schools with tremendous football his-
tory in the same state. No matter what the teams’ respective
records were, they played each other every year.

The last time the game was played was in 1992 at State
College. And for a month leading up to the game, there were
signs posted around campus offering rides and trips to the game.

For those relatively new to Pitt, that’s called school spirit.

And for those young ones without a keen sense of football his-
tory, Pitt used to be good. In fact, just seven years ago, the
Panthers knocked off the Nittany Lions in back—to-back games,
including a 10-0 victory in 1987 at Pitt Stadium. _

Three years ago the rivalry was discontinued —— set to start
back up in 1997. But now the Penn State athletic department has
decided they have better things to do. Like play Temple, Rutgers
and Southern Methodist University. 7

The killing of the Pitt - Penn State rivalry is a perfect example
of how not to do things.

And the solution is real simple. Put the game back on the
schedule.

Good move, McClatchy

While some college football people can’t get their act together,
new Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy seems to have his
eye on the ball. “

McClatchy is currently in the process of trying to find a new
stadium for the Buccos, keeping up with the other major league
teams. - I

And yesterday McClatchy announced that there will be no
increases in food, drink and souvenir prices at Three Rivers
Stadium this season. .

It’s ‘a relief to knowth-at not all baseball owners are idiots.

McClatchy has been on the right track since he was finally
approved to buy thePirates last month.

Along with keeping prices stable, McClatchy and Aramark
Services, the team’s concessionaire, plan to add new foods to the
stadium this season. '

So far, Kevin McClatchy is exactly what major league baseball
needs —— an owner who does something for the fans before his
bank account.

Take back the United States

Back when the Republican
primaries were still interesting,
Pat Buchanan was able to stir
up an increased focus on our
nation’s borders. His call for a
ban on all immigration is very
popular with many people. It
is, however, not the best way to

protect American jobs and pro-

mote assimilation of immi-
grants already here. And while
Buchanan’s views do not make

him an extremist —— I ﬁnd him 
too liberal for my taste"—-— they '

are potentially harmful to our
country.

Immigrants not only provide
a boost to our labor force, but
they also create large numbers
of jobs. For instance, the num-
ber of Cuban-owned business-
es in Miami has expanded from
919 in 1967 to 28,000 in 1990.
So while immigrants may be
“taking our jobs,” they are also
successful employers. In fact,
studies have actually shown
that periods of heavy immigra-
tion are usually followed by
lower unemployment figures.

Despite this trend, many
Americans fear losing jobs to
foreign-bom workers in both
high and l-ow—paying fields.
Native-bom Americans should
have every advantage over
immigrants in the labor force,
because natives are already
accustomed to American
employers, culture and lan-
guage. So if foreigners are able
to come here and take “our”
jobs, whose fault is that? The
increased competition that
immigrants provide ought to
propel overall productivity.

Another myth about immi-

gration is that foreigners come
here to go on welfare.
Immigrants generally come
here with little wealth, yet they
use fewer welfare services than
native families. Certainly,
immigrants shouldn’t be able
to come here and receive wel-
fare checks, but let’s get rid of
the welfare, not the immi-
grants. (And while we’re at it,

- we should end welfare for

native families, too.) In gener-

 

7 Matt
Mills

al, immigrants come here to
work hard and contribute to
society.

So while legal immigration is
good for the United States, our
toleration of illegal immigra-
tion remains an outrage. First,
people seem to forget that ille-
gal immigrants are breaking
the law, and we should have no
obligation to coddle them.
Illegals are also able to, avoid
paying income taxes.

Nevertheless, many people
feel that we should extend gov-
ernment benefits to those not
contributing to the system.
Buchanan is correct in wanting
to take more action to stop the
flow of illegal immigration.
Our efforts need to focus more
on the borders themselves,
rather than simply on appre-
hending illegals after they
arrive. Such an effort would
cost more, but it would also
save the money taxpayers
spend on illegals once they get
here. —

In addition, our tradition of.

extending citizenship to anyone
born on American soil should
be changed. Why should we
reward people clever enough to
break our laws with citizenship
for their children?

A pregnant woman can come
across the U.S. border illegally
and have free emergency room
delivery of her baby, which is
born a U.S. citizen. Then, the
woman can easily become a
citizen because her baby
already is. And of course, the
woman and her baby take the
place of two would-be legal
immigrants. Basically.‘ we’re

rewarding people who break
the law. The next thing you
know, we’ll have cable televi-
sion in our prisons.

Finally, those who favor a
ban on legal immigration point
to a lack of assimilation of
immigrants in American soci-
ety. This fact cannot be disput-
ed. Clearly, the U.S. should be
a melting pot, not a salad bowl.
The most important step we
could take to greater integra-
tion is to establish English as
the official language of the
U.S. This would mean that
only English should be used in
anything written by the govem-
ment. In particular, ballots
should be English-only. If
someone can’t read the
Constitution or Declaration of
Independence, then why should
he/she be allowed to vote?

Language is the most impor-
tant bond Americans can share.
Without a common _language,
we will become more and more
segregated. Eventually, places
known as “Little Cuba” or
“Little Mexico” could grow to
divide our border states.
Anyone who has been to
Miami lately would understand
this problem._It remains possi-
ble that parts of Texas or
Florida may eventually become
similar to Quebec. Last year,
when Québecois narrowly
defeated an independence ref-
erendum, the vote was mainly
split according to language.
Voters speaking only French
voted almost exclusively to
separate. Could such a problem
be on our horizon?

If we can -protect our borders
and integrate society, then cur-
rent levels of immigration need
to be sustained. We shouldn’t
burn the bridge that we or our
ancestors have already crossed.
Legal immigration has always
made our ‘country grow and
prosper. and we shouldn’t end
it in order to solve other prob-
lems.

Matt Mills wouldn't mind see-
ing Chris Jackson deported.

Trees Field:
A field of 3
dreams
for any
little ledger

  



 

Conist
Kevin
Lilley

or the past few
months, the
Pittsburgh Pirates

have been begging anybody
they can find to help them
finance a brand-new, base-
ball-only stadium.

’ This is comparable to
serving moldy bread and
rotten eggs under a covered
dish —- sure, it looks nice

from the outside, but that

doesn’t help the stench
underneath.

Nothing personal to Mr.
McClatchy, but the quality
of the product should make

' it back to below average, at

least, before anybody drops
the first nickel for a new
building. If the Pirates won
the division last year and
were forced to play in a
sub-par facility, it would be
a different story.

Or would it?

There is a baseball team
in this city that won a divi-
sion last season, yet it is
forced to play its home
games on a field that would
make most Little League
groundskeepers wince.

Here’s a hint: it ain’t
Carnegie Mellon.

For anyone who hasn’t
visited Trees Field, home
of the Big East Champion
Pitt Panthers, here are some
quick directions:

Hop a shuttle up to the
top of the hill, shuffle into
the Cost Center and take
the elevator (if it is even

. working) down through the

parking garage. Exit the
garage at ground level, _
hang a quick right and take
the muddy path through the
prison-like gates until you
come to what looks like an
intramural softball field.

Stop. You’re there.

This is the home of the
Big East Champions — a
secluded, enclosed patch of
grass with two sets of
bleachers and a scoreboard
that faces away from the
fans. The baselineslare-' .

Tennis makes history,

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

The Pitt tennis team made a little bit of history Tuesday
night as it defeated St. Bonaventure 5-4 for the first time in
the 16 years that coach George Dieffenbach has been here.

Leading the Panthers were Alison Baker, Jen Bible and
Kristin Siegel, all of whom won both their singles and dou-
bles matches. The team win over St. Bonaventure of the
Atlantic Ten Conference brings Pitt’s overall record to 7-6.

“These three contributed to the win,” Dieffenbach said.

Pitt’s Baker, the number three seed, defeated Paula Zakala
in single competition 6-0, 4-6 , 6-3. Number five seed Bible
won her singles match, defeating St. Bonaventure’s Sara
Mortimer 6-2, 4-6 , 6-4. Pitt’s Siegel, the number six seed,
easily defeated Heather O’Brien 6-2, 6-2.

Not only did Bible and Siegel prove to be a force in their
singles matches, they also dominated as a team. Bible and
Siegel played and won their doubles match, 8-1. Baker and
her partner Erin Shalbrack, the number two seed, defeated the
St. Bonaventure doubles, 8-5. '

Shalbrack’s doubles match turned out better than her sin-
gles, as she lost a tough match to Heather McCoy 4-8, 7-6, 6-
2. Also losing in their singles match were number four seed
Marla Zielinski and number one seed Fran Davis. Zielinski
lost to Becky Arnold 6-2, 6-2, and Davis lost to Nateetarn 6-
0, 6-0. ‘

“I knew it would be a tough match,” Davis said. “I had a
lot of trouble getting my rhythm.”

Davis and Zielinski teamed up for doubles competition but
were defeated by the St. Bonaventure team of McCoy and
Nateetarn 8-5. After coming off of a few losses over spring
break, the win over St. Bonaventure may prove to be the turn-
ing point of the season for Pitt.

“It was a good team effort. This win is very gratifying con-
sidering how hard the team has worked this year,”
Dieffenbach said. “It’s good to see hard work pay off.”

The win over St. Bonaventure is just the beginning.
There’s still more work to be done. Coach Dieffenbach said
the two things the team was going to work on this week were
serves and returning serves, because they were the two weak-
nesses that he noticed in the St. Bonaventure match.

Piff-PSU
rivalry
set to end

at200l

The legendary Pitt-Penn
State football rivalry will
apparently come to an end at
the start of the new millenni-
um.
The series, which dates
back to 1893, will resume in
1997 after a four-year hiatus
and run until the year 2000.
After that, there are no plans
to continue the in-state rival-

“Penn State has indicated
they do not want to continue
a home and home series
with us,” said Pitt Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes,

The two teams have
played 92 times, with Penn
State leading the series 47-
41-4. Until 1992, Pitt and
Penn State played 57
straight years from 1935 to
‘92. The last time the two
teams met, PSU blew out
Pitt 57-13 at Beaver
Stadium.

Next-year, Pitt travels to
Penn State. ~

“I feel badly for the fans,”
Jaynes said. “I think it's a
game that needs to be
played.”

“intimate” set for the ten big-haired mall
chicks still left, who haven’t sold out their
brunette roots by buying Doc Martens,
cutting their hair short, and wearing Nine
inch Nails shirts. Well, I hope old Vince
manages to lay a couple of 13-year-olds
after the show.

To round off this three-day celebrity

barrettes and slinky little-girl garb’

doing vocals with Mitchell Froom and
Tchad Blacke mixing and making

  

beats. The end result sounds like a
movie soundtrack of spooky, heavily
accented speech (punctuated by
occasional yelps), dreamy sound
effects and some occasionally hard-
hitting b-lines. its shining moment is
“Le Pain Perdu," a consistently dancy
track with some decent horn sam-
ples.

ironically, “Viva! La Woman” sports’
a She-ra-style cartoon woman on the.

cover in striking contrast to the

,,_do‘ci,le, candy‘-coated photo of the

girls on the inside. Cibo Matto follows.

an increaslnglylong line of Japanese

women riding the “foxcore” wave of

the late ‘80s with a ‘90s style multi-

cultural twist. Again the record indus-
try has tapped into trends —
adorable Asian femusicians and
sampled trip hop beats — and manu-
factured another tasty product for the
Generation X palate. ’

See Cibo Matto live performing with
Boss Hog this Wednesday, March 27
at 7 p.m. at Graffiti.

Boyracer
We Are Made of the Same
Wood

Slumberland Records

Keeping in mind the lo-fi
edginess and_pop sensibilities
that characterize this 12-song
EP, We Are Made of the
Same Wood could be used to
trace Boyracer’s familial ties
to The Clean, The
Replacements, and
Sebadoh— pioneering bands
who personally defined those
terms for the Music Dictionary
during that long-ago era of the
1980s. Boyracer isthe preco-
cious middle "child of post-

punk, caught between the
beautiful pop shimmerings of
Guided By'Voices and the
wall-of—sound recipe of fellow
Brits Swervedriver, personal-
izing a sound for themselves
their influences into one big
post-punk hybrid, adding
some weird electro-noise for
good measure. Since the
release of their debut effort,
1995's More Songs about

. Frustration and Se/f-Hate, the

quartet has become a favorite
of music reviewers on both
sides of the Atlantic. We Are
Made undoubtedly guarantees
that for Boyracer, critical
acclaim is gonna keep on a-
c_omin’.

We Are Made begins with
the catchy “Twisted Love,” a
song in which Boyracer places
distortion and Buzzcocks-style
hooks against the backdrop of
a steady, shuffling beat. The
lively vibrance of “Twisted”
makes it the musical equiva-
lent of playing _street_soccer

 with a soda can...Boyracer

kicking
“Superhip,” a superfresh ditty
that speeds up and slows
down, then speeds up again
in an unexpected twist-turn of
cymbal crash and guitar fuzz.
“Superhip’s”roiler-coaster
rhythm is peppered by a raw
punk edge reminiscent of “Let
it Be”-era Replacements. The
song comes complete with
tinny guitar feedback at the
end, just like the Mats’ “We’re
Coming Out.” However, Paul
Westerberg’s pissed-off
screaming style has been
replaced by the comparatively
calmer vocalizations of lead
singer Stewart Anderson.

The next track, “You’re
Breaking His Heart,” clocks in
at a Guided by Voices-ish 45
seconds and is a succinctly
executed exercise in Pollard-
style pop. Boyracer returns to
the three-minute formula with
“Area 51 Revisited,” a slow
skiprope of a ditty featuring a
pretty guitar strumming that
gives it a solid “pop feel. -

“Finger Pie” is what mid-eight-
ies MTV rock would have
sounded like had it gone lo-fi
instead of taking the winding
routeto Hyper-production
Hell. “Finger Pie" takes
Boyracer’s rocking sound a
mambo—step into outer spaci-
ness, throwing cosmic drum
machine samples, hip-hop
scratching and weird doodad-
generated buzzing and bleep-
ing into the mix. To get a good
idea of this combination, try to
imagine what Herbie

,Hancock’s “Rock It’’ would

have sounded like if made by
a quartet of white indie-rock-
ers from Britain.
“Post-Modernist Retro
Bullshit,” a fierce all-out rock-
er, illustrates that Boyracer
embraces all of punk’s many
speeds and volumes. Walls of
distortion are raised and then
quickly torn down, serving as
temporary road blocks to
guide bassist Nicola while she
lets her fingers meander all

over the fretboard. Post “Post- .

out at a slightly slower pace,
culminating in the quiet,
aching melody of ‘‘In Love
With These Times.” This song
defines the word “solitude” so
completely that it seems as
though Stewart grabbed his
lonely guitar, rowed out to a
deserted island and recorded
it. However, he comes back,
puts the acoustic back in the
case and joins the rest of the
band to finish off the record
with “Serious Teeth,” a cut-
and-pasted collage of sam-
pling brilliance. With an open-
ing beat coming straight out of
a London house club,
“Serious” will have you won-
dering if your CD player has
changed discs. This clever
creative move demonstrates
that with ' We Are Made of the
Same Wood Boyracer has
pulled out all the stops, refus-
ing to close its bag of unex-
pected tricks until the very
end.

In September of 1952 at
the Maverick Concert»Hal| in
Woodstock, New York, avant-
garde composer John Cage
shocked concert-goers and
made experimental music his-
tory with the public perfor-
mance of his original piece, 4’
33"— a three-movement com-
position consisting of absolute-
ly no notes and no written
music. The idea was that lis-
teners would pay attention to
the oft-ignored noises being
created around them, and ulti-
mately come to the realization
that the noises of a city street
or raindrops falling on a roof
can and should be considered
music.

An interesting John Cage
tribute CD entitled A Chance
Operation was released
recently in collaboration with
the Gay Men's Health Crisis
Center and features perform-
ers as diverse as Yoko Ono,
Frank Zappa, Laurie Anderson
and the Kronos Quartet.
Artists were offered no musical
or technical guidelines; the
ensuing result contains more
than two hours of eccentric,
challenging musical sounds
andideas.

Minimalist composer Philip
Glass also claims to have
been greatly influenced by

Cage’s works; his Songs From
Liquid Days album contains
lyrics by Paul Simon and con-
temporary Cage admirer David
Byrne. Liquid Days features
the composition work of folk
heroes the Roaches as well as
ambient godfathers The
Kronos quartet, a string quar-
tet which has dabbled in
everything from George
Crumb’s Black Angels (a terri-
fying piece in which perform-
ers play violins with the back
of their bows) to Latin tango
music.

Cage’s ideas have influ-
enced scores of modern pop
stars as well: The Velvet
Underground’s John Cale
studied under Cage in the
early '60s. During one memo-
rable performance in 1963,

 

Cage and Cale participated in
an 18-hour 40-minute piano
marathon in which composer
Erik Satie’s 80-second piece
Vexations was repeated a total
of 840 times. Rhino Records
has recently released a mam-
moth collection of John Cale’s
highly experimental solo work
entitled Seducing Down the
Door, which exhibits symphon-
ic compositions as well as the
ambient experimentalism and
simple rock ‘n’ roll Cale creat-
ed between 1970 and 1990.
Many tracks include the tal-
ents of fellow Cage devotee
Brian Eno, most popularly
known for his production work
with the Talking Heads and his
oddly ambient noise/sound
records of the 1970s. The title
track from Eno’s surprisingly

iyiiieliiile

melodic Another Green World
showed up, not surprisingly,
on the soundtrack to a
Salvador Dali documentary
entitled The Definitive Dali.
And in 1979, Brian Eno wrote
what he considered to be the
definitive soundtrack to the
United States Apollo Mission
entitled Apollo: Atmospheres
and Soundtracks, a strangely
hypnotizing album which
affords its listener the unique
chance to experience the
music of an atmosphere-free
environment.

Visionary King Crimson
quitarist Robert Fripp has col-
laborated with Eno on a num-
ber of occasions. 1994's
Essential Fripp and Eno is a
complicated album of ambient
guitar and synthesizer music;

 

the second half of the album is
a concept piece consisting of
four separate interpretations of
repetitive guitar reverbera-
tions, which, although not
entirely original, nonetheless
explores a fascinating concept
in musical time/space configu-
ration.

On a slightly more interac-
tive note, however, New York
City’s progressive music and
art world has recently raised
the collective consciousness
concerning experimental
sounds; interactive “atmos-
pheres” know as “ambient par-
ties" have sprung up all over
the SoHo/ East Village areas.
Instead of dancing, clubgoers
relax on couches while listen-
ing to live or prerecorded
music. Others might experi-
ment with instruments, com-
puters, or toys purposely
strewn throughout the club,
and some might choose to
ignore the music altogether
and talk among themselves,
thereby adding to the noise
and creating unique sounds all

The people of CMU’s AB
Concerts have simply outdone
themselves this time.
Saturday, March 23, the
Mellon institute Auditorium will
house-one the most important
jazz concerts in Pittsburgh’s
history: David S. Ware
Quartet. This band has been
receiving critical acclaim from
all ends of the globe for
putting out some of the most
exciting and consistent record-
ings in the post-free jazz
arena.

What is post-tree jazz?
Anything . post-
Coleman/Dolphy? lt’s just
some media-constructed term
that vaguely describes a strat-
egy of music. Whatever. And
what a strategy it is!
Convention is put aside and

' limitless, cliché- smashing,

creative free energy is
unleashed. What makes David
S. Ware special is the way in

that he owes a lotto Taylor as
well, but then again, who
doesn’t? Ware’s playing
evokes Ayler, Coltrane, but is
truly unique and separate from
these influencesqlntense
seems to belittle his tenor
assault; Ware doesn’t play the
sax, he screams it, spews it,
rejoices it. His rich tone, with a
penchant for the low register
and supersonic speeds,
makes him one of the most
formidable tenor players out
there— period. The group has
put out another CD on the
indie rock label Homestead, a
follow-up to the revered
Cryptology. lt’s entitled Dao
and is truly remarkable. A
must for any jazz fan and(or
music lover.

Opening the 8 p.m. show is
Pittsburgh’s own (post) free
jazz ensemble, 40 Stories. If
you haven’t heard this group,
you are missing out on a real
treat. Led by saxman/compos-'
er Micah Gaugh, 40 Stories
create some of the most emo-
tionally charged dynamic jazz
l’ve ever seen/heard. They

 
 

  
   

   

have clearly developed into a
mature and tight ensemble
that has clearly pulled its vari-
ous music backgrounds
together into a cohesive unit.
Gaugh has done time with
Cecil Taylor and plays every
night in New York (his home,
for the moment) with amazing
players, too many to note.
Drummer Kevin Shea, who
destroys the beat with The
Storm and Stress, and Oliver
Kollar (guitar), and Chris
Strollo (sax) round out the
ensemble with their Berklee
training. They are truly a live
band and unfortunately have
no recordings out (except for a
song on Manny’s experimental
comp). Recently 40 Stories
have been winning over the
Knitting Factory scene. Why
wait? Support local music!

Again, this is a show NOT to
be missed. David S. Ware and
40 Stories will perform this
Saturday, March 23, at the
Mellon Institute Auditorium in
Oakland. The show will start at
8 p.m. Don’t be late!

entire floor might be covered
with bubble wrap; at a recent
party in Manhatten, the entire
evening was orchestrated
according to John Cage’s com-
position Variations I-/V, which
provides a specific time frame

_in which activities should occur

throughout the night. The cre-
ative union between ambience
and club culture has its origins
in England’s techno parties of
the late 1980s where DJ’s
would provide organic, relaxing
music from bands like The Orb
for ravers who chose to relax in
the often aurally-challenging
“chill-out” rooms. Here they
could take a break from danc-
ing (similar to New York’s ambi-
ent parties) and contemplate
everything from the simple
sounds of nature to the noises
of barnyard animals. The most
important thing to remember
when discussing ambience in
sound is that challenging, inno-
vative music has been around
for ages. lts originations and
influences are felt at nearly all

levels of music, (the composi-
tions of John Cage’s personal
instructor, Arnold Schoenberg,
are studied here at Pitt in a

popular Art Music class a|ong- 

side Beethoven and Chopin)

and as long as humans can lis- _.

ten, sounds of all shapes and
sizes will continue to make their
way into music.

if you already have a healthy
interest in the ambient/ experi-
mental music forms, you’ll be
interested to. know that Brian

Eno and Peter Gabriel are cur- »

rently at work planning a top-
secret amusement park slated
to open in Venezuela sometime

in the near future. If you haven’t 

yet acquainted yourself with

should mention that her gui-

one hell of a sexy dude himself.

Now that we've gotten that
out of the way, we can get
down to this business of rock. if
my memory serves me correct-

Men and women's lacrosse cruise by Davis & Elkins

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

The men’s and women’s lacrosse
teams hosted Davis and Elkins College
last Tuesday at the Cost Center. The
men continued their wrecking—ball
ways with an easy 11-1 win. ,

In their first game, the women lost 9-
7. They were troubled by refs who had
never done a girls’ game, which
allowed the game to get physical at
times.

“It was a little frustrating because the
refs weren’t familiar with our game, so
the game got a little rougher and less
skillful than it should be,” Coach Jeroo
Sinor said. “I think we were more
skilled than the other team, but since
they had the aggressive edge they could
take it away from us.”

The team also. had no subs to come
off the bench, except for Coach Sinor
who came in near the end of the game,
donned in her blue jeans, when a player
had to come out because of a leg injury.

“We did have a couple of extra play-

Determine your ﬁtness level and body
composition AND get updated on the
latest health and nutrition information

ers, but because of the two-hour delay
from the tennis match, some girls went
home to do homework and other
things,” Sinor said. “We usually will
have four to five subs. Davis and Elkins
had an advantage by being able to sub
in whole teams.”

Pitt’s first score came when Amanda
Smith. blocked an outlet pass and then

Jodi Marcus picked it up and slammed’

it in from up close, tying the score at 1.

Marcus scored a few minutes later
when she caught a pass from 25-feet
out and used her speed to shake and
bake past the defense for a point-blank
shot.

Heather Dowdy then made it 3-1 with
a speed rush from the left side beating
the defender and the goalie. V

The Senators answered the Pitt run on
two quick goals, tying the score at 3.
Then Smith netted two goals, and
Marcus added her third, giving Pitt a 6-
4 halftime lead.

Starting the second
half, Elkins was on the
attack getting good

scoring chances, but on three consecu-
tive possessions, Pitt goalie Jess Strelitz
made three similar saves in which she
went to her knees to block bounce
shots.

Then captain Lorma Capili fought off
a defender for a ground ball, which
gave her an_open path to the net, and
she capitalized making the score 7-4.

With a three-goal lead and less than
seven minutes to play, Pitt seemed to
have the advantage, but Elkins rallied
and went on to score five unanswered
goals to win 9-7.

“We haven’t had any scrimmages in
practice yet, so now we know what we
need to ‘work on,” said Sinor.

The men bettered their record to 4-0
and continued their dominance by only
allowing four shots for the entire game.

Despite the drubbing, Coach Gary
Neff felt his team played sloppy and
down to the opponent’s level. _

“This was a good two week warm-up,
but now it’s crunch time. I think we’re
ready. Tonight I told the team to go out
there and make it work, and to not to do
anything you can’t get away with in a
regular game,” said Neff.

The first of four first-period goals
was scored by Mike Tanniru after mid-

fielder Rob Heaps beat two defenders . I

and passed to the open Tanniru, who
slammed it home.

Next, Captain Dave Walter came
from behind the net, circled out in front
of the net with a defender on his hip
and scored on a bounce shot.

Tanniru and Heaps hooked up again
on a score; this time Tanniru served up
a pass from behind the net to the cutting
Heaps who scored, making it 3-0.

Then defenseman John Foris made an
outlet pass off a turnover to Bret
Meyer-Kincak, who took the ball from

spi is a
pair over

Break

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

The Pitt Rugby team trav-
elled to North Carolina over
Spring Break in an attempt to
escape from the Cathedral
lawn’s mud and win two on
the road. They won one.

The Panthers lost to North

" Carolina State, 38-5, but

saved their road trip three
days later with a 5-3 victory
over Duke.

“I was real impressed with
how everyone redeemed
themselves,” said the team’s
captain, senior Kevin
Clancey. “It was a total turn-
around.”

At Duke, senior Jeff Derda
scored the winning goal and
the Panthers won almost
every scrimmage against
Duke. The Panthers were
much more aggressive and
took advantage of every
opportunity to attack the other
team’s line. If the ball began
with them in a set-pattem, the
beginning scrimmage, it
stayed with the Panthers and
out of the Blue Devils’ hands.

“We pushed them all over
the field,” said junior Robert

, Maillard. “We stole at least

three—quarters of theirs [pos-
sessions - called put-ins in
rugby].”

After missing several
opportunities to score off of
penalty attempts, the Blue
Devils scored their three
points on a penalty kick 23
meters out from the goal on
an offsides call.

“If we would have played
NC State the way we played
Duke, we would have won,”
Clancey said. “Our tackling
was terrible against NC state.
[At Duke] our forwards domi-
nated the whole game, pushed
their pack all over the field.”

It wasn’t the team veterans
mauling the other team.

“Usually we take an A—side,
fifteen of the best players,
said Maillard.

Instead, the rookie team
members served a pivotal role
in the pack. Since the games
occurred over spring break,
many players could not travel.

“It was a _lot of inexperi-
ence,” said Maillard. “The
rookies did fine. It was only
the second game they
played.”

The Panthers will commune

with the’ mud again on

Saturday. They take on
Southern Pitt, a local area
club, at Lower Frick Park at
1:00 p.m.

After that game, the
Panthers will play. in the
Pittsburgh City Club’s touma-
ment against teams from New
York and one team from the
United Kingdom, March 30
and 31.

The Pitt News, Thursday, March 21, 1996

Column

‘From page 8
grass (no dirt cutout — too fancy),
and" the home dugout sits about six

; inches from a seven-story stone wall

that overshadows the whole mess.

There is no concession stand. Fans
must look through the backstop fence
to see the field. The public address
system is a glorified megaphone on a
three-foot metal pole shoved in the
corner by the entrance.

Truly, a fine arena. A little paint, a
few shovels of dirt here and there, and
it might be ready for the local Junior
Legion team.

And the Pirates complain about their_

stadium. The Pitt squad plays a few
games at Three Riv_ers this season,
and from their viewpoint, that 1970s V
cavern might as well be Wrigley
Field.

As if the field weren’t enough of a
disgrace, the coaches and the team,
with the help of a few maintenance
workers, are charged with raking the
mound and covering the field at the
end of each game.

So not only do players get to spend
their home games on an ugly ballfield,
they also get to maintain it. Talk about
a recruiting gimmick: “Well, son, not
only will you get a Pitt education and
play for a championship baseball
team, you can also learn valuable
groundskeeping skills for a future
career in dirt management.”

Can you see a similar setup in other
major Pitt sports? Mark Blount hold-

- ing up Kevin Willard so he can dust

the shot clock? Johnny Majors spend-
ing his Saturday evenings on the Pitt

Stadium astroturf, mopping up what’s
left of his defense?

What possible excuse is there for
this? True, thanks to a hidden field
and low publicity, the baseball team
doesn’t draw many people, but that
shouldn’t relegate them to cleanup
duties. The Pitt Lady Panthers don’t
draw either, but I have yet to catch
Gina Montesano or Kirk Bruce wiping
up the Field House floor after a home
game. ’

This is not to suggest that the athlet-

ic department should blow half the
budget for a miniature Camden Yards.
It would be a nice touch, though, if it
could build another baseball field, one
with a readable scoreboard, a conces-
sion stand and bleachers that make the
game look more like a national pas-
time and less like a WWF steel cage
match.

If not, at least do some renovations.
Dirt baselines would be nice, and
maybe the mud pit across the way
from the field could be cleaned up a
bit. A grounds crew wouldn’t be a bad
idea, either.

In other words, make the field, and
the team, respectable. In a school
starved for athletic champions in
recent years, it makes no sense to
shove a winning squad into a corner
field underneath the Cost Center. Give
it a stage. Show it off.

Or, at the very least, find someone
else to rake the mound.

In the second and third quar-
ters, Pitt scored only two
goals, one each by Heaps and
Walter, pushing the lead to 6-
1.

“We are not finishing. We
are going to need to do that,
but right now we are not. We

Neff. -
’ The fourth quarter was Pitt’s ,

injury. In both of his previ-
ous trips to the tournament,
Wiltanger was eliminated in
the first round.

Of Pitt’s three other quali-
fiers, only junior Bryan
Matusic has been to nation-
als before, and like

Wiltanger, he will be looking-

for his first win at the
NCAAs. After wrestling
most of this season at 177
pounds, Matusic moved
down to 167, where he wres-
tled in the last two national
meets.

Sophomore Mark Bodo
has shown that he can do
what it takes to succeed in

‘ tournaments. Bodo started

out the season with eight
straight victories and went
on to register anill-bout
winning streak later in the
season. Bodo is 17-2 in his
last 19 matches, with his
only two losses coming to
Clarion’s Bryan Stout, who’s
ranked second in the country
at 190 pounds.

In contrast, Jacob Schaus,
who qualified for nationals
at 158 pounds, has not won
more than three consecutive
matches this season. The
redshirt freshman compiled a
relatively unimpressive 16-
12 record this season, but
has come through when it
matters most, including scor-
ing a takedown as time
expired to take third’ place at
the EWL championships,
earning a trip to nationals.

The team has spent most
of this week in Minnesota
preparing for the three-day
meet and was not available
for comment.
