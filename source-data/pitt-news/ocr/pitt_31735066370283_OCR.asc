Minor quake rocks Western Pennsylvania

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

On Friday, residents of Pittsburgh
were a little shook-up — literally.

An earthquake registering 5.0 on
the Richter scale rattled parts of the
Midwest and, Northeast. The quake
was centered about 30 miles northeast
of Cleveland, near Ashtabula, but
sent tremors into as many as seven dif-
ferent states.

Although there was only minor
damage in Ohio and no injuries,
many people were frightened — in-
cluding those who felt the tremors in

“I felt it pretty good here. There was no damage,

but a couple of pencils did roll off the desks.”

the Pittsburgh area. I

“I felt it pretty good here,’ said
Walter Pilant, a professor of Geology
and Planetary Sciences‘ at Pitt. “There
was no damage, but a couple of pen-
cils~did roll off the desks.

“The damage was more psychologi-
cal than physical. The people in the
Cathedral of Learning, especially

those on the 36th floor, felt the
building sway and were frightened."

A spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh
Fire Department said there were
many calls from frightened residents
wanting to know what was
happening.

“The phones have been ringing‘

nonstop,” she ‘said. “People are

wondering what happened.”

The quake, which started at 11:47
a.m., lasted about 30 seconds. It was
felt as three separate tremors — the
second one being the most intense.

According to Pilant, the cause of
the earthquake is unknown.

“It’s a greatmystery why this type
of activity occurs," he said. “There are
as many theories as there are people.”

Greg Dugan, a Pitt junior, had a
similiar reaction.

“I was lying in my bed when every-
thing started to shake,” he said. “I
thought somebody was jumping on
the floor upstairs but then my room-

mate came in and said he felt the
shaking too. I knew then that it must
have been an earthquake."
There'has never been an earth-
quake in the Pittsburgh area. Accor-
ding to Pilant, though, residents in

Ambridge and Aliquippa felt tremors _

in 1980.

“Back in 1980 there was an earth-
quake in western Kentucky,” said
Pilant, “and places like Ambridge
and Aliquippa felt it, but this is the
first time in my experience that a
tremor of this magnitude was felt in
Pittsburgh."

Shuttle crew to be honored  

Cape Canaveral (UPI) — The Ken-
nedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral
will observe a moment of silence every
Jan. 28 at 11:39 a.m. EST.

Spaceport director Richard Smith
made that announcement Saturday
morning as the ground crews
gathered for a memorial service to the
seven crew ‘members of the
Challenger. As .the clock reached
11:39 a.m., the minute of the disaster
last Tuesday, a helicopter hovering
offshore dropped a wreath into the
Atlantic Ocean.

Northeast of the Cape, a NASA
ship lowered a robot submersible to
inspect a large object on the ocean
floor, possibly the remains of the crew
cabin; a section of the nose of the
shuttle was brought up in an earlier
sweep. The search area has now been
widened to extend from the Cape to

Savannah, Ga. and-90’miles out to

563..

Despite the official silence, infor-
mation is emerging that could help
explain why the Challenger was blown
apart 72 seconds after launch. NASA
sources say high on the list of causes
is a possible failure of one of the space
shuttle’s solid fuel booster rockets.
The New York Times said a NASA
report shows one of the rockets losing
thrust about. 10 seconds before the ex-
plosion. The newspaper quoted a Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board
source in Washington who said the
shuttle’s three main engines swiveled
to one side to try to compensate for
the lack of thrust and then shut down.

The report said engineers believe
flames reaching 6,000 degrees shot
through the side of the solid fuel
booster and may have cut the pipe.
which carries liquid fuel from the

huge external tank to the shuttle's
engines. A computer—enhanced
videotape analysis by United Press In-.
ternational shows the spaceship
emerging from the immense fireball
nine miles above the Atlantic. The
analysis reveals that the Challenger
exploded one-fifth of a second later,
apparently because of the ignition of
two rocket fuel tanks in the shuttle’s
nose.

The Soviet Union said its cartog-
rapher will name two craters on the
planet Venus after the two women
crew members Judith Resnik and
Christa McAuliffe. The craters are
being named after the women in
keeping with the mythology surroun-
ding the goddess of love. American
scientists who recently identified 10
moons orbiting Uranus have‘previous-
ly said that they will name seven’ of
those moons for Challenger's crew.

Pitt to celebrateblack history

By Leeli Davidson

For the Pitt News

February is Black History Month
and, in celebration, the university
campus will be alive with speakers,
workshops and ﬁlms commemorating
black accomplishments.

Black History Month grew out of
Negro History Week which was in-
troduced in 1926. Leon L. Haley,

Biological Honor Society revived

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer 1

Recently,_Tri Beta, the national
biological honor society, has been
revived after having been defunct for
several years. According to vice presi-
dent Joe Patti, the goals of the
organization are ‘varied.

“We want to promote all aspects of
biology,” Patti said. “We're looking
to get biology majors together.
Also, our organization will give
students an opportunity to have one
on one conversations with faculty
members."

Eric Cotton, president of Tri Beta,
noted that the society, in addition to
its principal academic functions, also
serves as a social organization.
Though Pitt’s chapter of Tri Beta is
still in its infancy, its aspirations, ac-
cording ’ to Patti, are rather

 ambitious.

    

W...  _. _',-,_-.~

“We want to rapidly increase our

membership," he said. We want to _

make freshmen and sophomores
aware of Tri Beta.  We want to bet-
ter the biology department and make
it comparable to those of the Ivy
League schools.”

Already, the club hopes to sponser
a variety of activities. As Cotton
pointed out, Tri Beta plansto en-
courage a great deal of biological
research. According to the president,
members, via the organization, could
have the opportunity to exhibit their

. experiments at a national level. Cot-

ton said he expects to send delegates
to regional and even national con-
ferences, hopefully beginning with
Tri Beta’s next annual meeting in
New Orleans.

Other activities include fund raisers
and various research seminars and
symposiums. The group, according to
Cotton, hopes to invitea number of

speakers. At present, Tri Beta hopes
to hear from several top east-coast
research professors. '

Membership in the society is based
chieﬂy upon academics. According to
Patti, a biology major needs a 3.0 to
be an active member. He mentioned,
‘however, that there are no scholastic
requirements for those who wish to re-
main inactive. In addition one may
participate in Tri Beta as a graduate
or honorary member.

Both Cotton and Patti stressed the
advantages of belonging to their
organization for a pre-professional
student.

Patti added that contacts with pro-
fessors might be particularly helpful.

In terms of money, $25 can buy one
lifetime membership. According to
Patti, there are basically no dues re-
quired with the exception of this in-
itial payrnent. -’

Director and former dean of

Graduate and International Affairs at _

the University of Pittsburgh, said that

although Black History Month‘

bestows honor on “primarily black
America, it oftentimes deals with the
historic roots of blacks in Black Africa
and the Caribbean. Black History
Month deals with the sense of where
blacks in America came from.”

Michelle Anne Bell, the Black Ac-
tion Society’s coordinator for Black
History Month, thinks that black con-
tributions should be remembered year
round. Bell said that F ebruary’s Black
History Month is “held to ensure that
our black achievers are being
acknowledged.”

Campus sponsors of Black History

'Month include the BAS, the Pitt Pro-

gram‘Council and the black studies
department. The theme the BAS has
chosen for Black History Month is “A
Charge for the '80s: Where to From
Here.”

Kwame Ture, formerly Stokey Car-
michael, will give the first February
lecture. Pan-Africanism will be the
topic of Ture's lecture and workshop.
Pan-Africanism is a term applied to
political movements the goal of which
is to create a unified Africa,
abolishing colonialism and white rule.
Ture’s lecture is on Feb. 3 in the
David Lawrence Auditorium at 8:30
p.m.’ ‘

Randall Robinson, will be lectur-
ing on Feb. 7 at 6:30 p.m. in the Stu.-
dent Union Ballroom. Robinson is

tive campaigner against apartheid.
Miss America of 1984 Suzette
Charles will appear on the Pitt cam-
pus in honor of Black History Month.
Frank Barbalace, head of the PPC
who invited Charles to Pittsburgh, ex-
plained why the PPC decided to in-
vite Charles. “We wanted a non-
political figure," said Barbalace, “a
motivational speaker. We also wanted
a person‘ who gives a positive self-
image.” Suzette Charles will speak in
the WPU Assembly Room on Feb. 11
at 8 p.m. 1
With the exception of Suzette
Charles, the PPC has involved itself
in politics this Black History Month.
The PPC has organized three
tributes: to Paul Robeson, to Melvin
Van Peebles and to black ﬁlmmakers.

‘in other lands. The tribute to Paul

Robeson, inﬂuential actor and singer,

will be Feb. 6 at 7:30 p.m. in the ,

Assembly Room and the tribute to
Melvin Van Peebles is at 9 p.m. in the
David Lawrence Auditorium on
Feb.27.

Racism on the University of Pitts-
burgh campus and elsewhere will be
addressed in a workshop given by Lil-
ly Allen on Feb. 17. The BAS or-
ganized this workshop, and in atten-
dance will bethe heads of major cam-
pus organizations, including IF C,.

U.S. sanctions against Libya went
into effect on Saturday and all
Americans are supposed to be out of
the North African country. Some
Americans, however, are reported to
be staying put, despite President
Reagan's order to leave. A State

. Department official says they are now

pretty much on their own. Robert
Oakley, director of the State Depart-
m_ent’s Office for Counter-Terrorism
and Emergency Planning, says the
government is not responsible for
Americans who remain in Libya il-
legally and now face prosecution.
In his own words, “Those who say
that they have a good-paying job, and
we don’t have one at home, so we’re
not going home, well,‘ you’re better off
not coming home.” He says
Americans who refused to leave Libya
are liable for up to 10.years in jail and
a $50,000 fine if they come home at
a later date. Oakley also says US.
citizens who remain in Libya should
be much less vulnerable to hostage-
taking under the sanctions simply
because the United States has made
it clear it does not really accept the
responsibility for them.

 

Pope met with
protests in India

Hindu protesters burned the Pope’s
effigy and told him to go home as he
began a grueling 10-day visit to In-
dia on Saturday. Pope john Paul II,
was greeted by Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandi and President Zail Singh.
Twelve million of India's 750 million
people are Catholics. Police arrested
about 300 members of the All-India
Hindu Organization who planned to
march on the cathedral where the
pope went to pray after leaving.the
airport.

Pharmacy giant
owes IRS millions

The Internal Revenue Service and
A.H. Robins, the ﬁnancially troubl-
ed pharmaceutical giant, have a $26
million discrepancy. The IRS wants
more than $35 million in back taxes
and a similar amount in interest, but
Robins contends it owes only $4

 

‘million and no more than $7 million.

Lawyers say the dispute must be settl-
ed before lawsuits against Robins’
Dalkon Shield contraceptive also can
be settled. '

Reagan ‘orders
federal budget cut

President Reagan has taken the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings axe to the
federal budget. He ordered cuts of
$11.7 billion for federal agencies,
declaring that “zero hour is upon us."
The cuts for fiscal 1986 were required
by today under the new budget-
balancing law'passed by Congress in
December. They will take effe_ct
March 1, unless Congress proposes
and Reagan signs an alternative
deficit-cutting program which of-
ficials consider highly unlikely to
happen. I

Reagan’s order merely ratifies the
cuts of 4.9 percent for military spend-
ing and 4.3 percent for domestic
spending which the general accoun-
ting office agreed last month must be
made to meet the new law’s reduction
target. Social Security and some

 

welfare programs are exempt, as are

A military pay increases for this year.

Reagan made the announcement in
his weekly radio address, re-affirming
his political blueprint for returning
manyyfederal programs to state or
local governments or for selling some
outright to private enterprise. .

Haiti callsoff
military parade

Haiti’s president called off a

military parade on Saturday just one .

day after a White House official said
that the Haitian leader had been
ousted and fled the country. The
White House report turned out to be
wrong, and the U.S. official later said
there had been a communications

imix-up. President Jean-Claude

Duvalier says he canceled'the tradi-
tional Feb. 1 ceremony to honor his
palace guards because troops were
needed to protect newly re-opened
businesses against demonstrators. '
A state of siege remains in effect in
Haiti, and the State Department has
advised Americans not to travel to the
Caribbean country. The military

Tragedy Of
Resettlement

Human ‘suffering, already a tragically familiar
commodity in famine-stricken Ethiopia, is
presently being aggravated by the resettlement
program imposed by that country’s government ..
According to a report released by a relief group
calling itself Doctors Without Borders, 100,000
people have already died as a result of the pro-

, gram. In its report, the group stated that the
relief program is “a more important cause of
mortality than the famine itself.”

It has been speculated that the Ethiopian
government is forcibly relocating people from
the desolate northern highlands, where guerrilla
Warfare is currently being waged, to the more
fertile lands of the south for the purpose of -
creating a system of collectivized farms. While
the efficacy of this program as a solution for
Ethiopia’s problem with recurrent famine is
arguable, the conditions under which it has been
imposed are, beyond a doubt, reprehensible.
The report issued by the relief group said that
“many of those relocated were lured by donated
food and blankets or prodded at gunpoint.”
Moreover, the frail, emaciated state of the
highlanders has left them, for the most part,
unable to endure the rigors of relocation and
with little protection against the diseases of the
southern regions. ‘ _

American policy to date has been to continue
providing food and supplies for emergency relief
in Ethiopia while disassociating itself from the
policies of the Ethiopian government. a This
seems a prudent, if cautious, course. What is
presently needed, however, is for the United
States, through the United Nations, to pressure
strenuously the Ethiopian government to recon-
sider its harsh, inhumane resettlement program.

Dry Rush
Controversy

This letter is in reference to Liz
Habib’s article “IFC seeks rights in dry
rush controversy” which appeared in
the Friday, Jan. 31 issue. 4

First, this letter was factually incor-
rect. "Larry Lunsford no longer works
at the university; Louise McL_inden’s
name is Louis McLinden; and Ter-
rence Milani’s name was also spelled
incorrectly. These are mistakes that
should have been caught by the
author, the editor and the copy desk,
respectively.

Second, and more importantly, Liz
Habib is a member of the executive
board of the Panhellenic Association.

~ The Interfraternity Council and the

Panhellenic Association have been
working closely in protesting the Of-
fice of Student Activities’ decision to
implement a dry rush. While her facts
may have been correct, I believe this
is a conﬂict of interest, as it is difficult
to separate one’s self from what seems
to be a rather volatile, emotional
issue.

If the question is not whether the
IFC is supporting the National Frater-

nity Council’s policy on dry rush, but .

rather if the administration has
violated the lFC’s right to allow
private, invitation only parties, then
show me evidence that indeed a viola-

Hazing In A Bottle

You are to be commended on your
cartoon,..“Hazing in a Bottle," printed
on Jan. 24. It was neither humorous,
accurate nor fair to Pitt's Greek
community. ‘

Apart from the Omega Phi Psi
case, Pitt has an exceptional reputa-
tion for the absence of hazing. Many
frate‘rnities, both local and nation-
wide, have publicly denounced haz-
ing and have taken strict measures to
prevent any pledging incidents or rites
that would be physically or mentally
demeaning or cruel. The Interfrater—
nity Council has also, in the past,
taken a strong stance against frater-

“Didn’t you tell them how much

“Yes, and then they told me

“Now we have to decide what to

“Yeah. How do we get it back?"

“Hold on, son. I’ve got some

Keeping An Open Mz°nd/ Anthony Rosati  

Is America Losing Its Pioneering Spirit?

I am upset, very upset. Onjan. 28,
I mourned the loss of seven bold
pioneers. Twenty-four hours later, I
felt the need to mourn an additional
loss — America's pioneer spirit.

No, I am not being overly cynical,
nor am I overdramatizing. America
is being seriously crippled by a cor-
ruption that is striking at the very
roots of this country's soul and history;
for some godforsaken reason,
everybody wants to feel “safe." Yeah,
that's right — the “corruption" I'm
talking about is “feeling safe." And
no, I am not nuts, or even close to it;
I’m deadly serious.

During those 24 hours following the
explosion, in—flight, of the
Challenger, I began noticing more

and more people talking about aban-
doning the “manned exploration"
program NASA had begun over 20
years ago. What bothered me was not
the shock these people felt over the
traumatic death of astronauts; it was
the overriding concern with continu-
ing the exploration of space? Surely,
something is wrong here!

Our country was not only founded
by people who wanted a new life in
a new land, but it was built by those
same bold pioneers. There isn't a state
in the Union today that wasn't settl-
ed by people with that spirit. Every
major advance in our culture, every
stand ever taken was done so by that
singular statement of America — the
pioneer. Even the immigrants who
came to America after it was suffi-

ciently molded as a thriving nation
were pioneers, for they risked
everything to come to a strange, new
land with bold dreams and aspira-
tions. Each and every one of us owes
our existence to a pioneer, whether we
realize it or not.

America's pioneer spirit was a
forceful power; it drove men and
women to the very brink of disaster,
and many times beyond it. Were
those affected by it lunatics? Hardly.
They realized the risks of their under-
takings, but were willing to chance
even their lives to “make it work."
What most marked their efforts was
the desire to keep on going even
though many had died before them.
If it wasn't for that desire, the west

would never have been settled, the
colonies would never have revolted

against King George, the skies would
still be uncrossed with the silver wings
and white, wispy trails of jets. Indeed,
if “being safe" had been more impor-
tant than “making it work," we
wouldn't have many of the “luxuries"
we so heavily depend upon; cars,
modern medicine, the petroleum in-
dustry and political freedom.

“So what’s the big deal?" you may
ask. Well, I could have managed to
let pass this article if only a handful
of people had mentioned the need to
do things safely, but, instead, there
was an overwhelming majority who
felt.it was a justifiable goal. To these
people I say “baloney." If they want

‘Page, 5 .

to feel so safe with the rest of the
world, then they should stay in bed.
In fact, if you really want to push this

“argument,” maybe they shouldn't?

even leave the glorious safety of the
womb!

The exploration of our universe will
certainly involve the deaths of many
of our friends. It is a “fact" of explor-
ing — not that we resign ourselves to
their deaths, but that, in spite of our

vigilant efforts to be cautious, there-

is always the unknown, the unexplain-
ed, the unexpected just waiting to
happen out in whatever frontier we
choose to explore. To demand that
such exploring be done in complete
safety is ludicrous and unreasonable.
just ask any pioneer!

Washington Post Writers Gr0up/ Richard Cohen

Who’s The Real “ erk”?

On his Saturday radio show, Gar-
rison Keillor told the story of a soft-
ball game between his team of sen-
sitive, no-hit, no-field wonders and a
crew of “jerks” from a Minneapolis
bar. With the score something like
24-2 in favor of the “jerks,” one of
them smashed a hit into the outfield
— a clear double that he stretched in-
to a home run by running right over
the third baseman. Her name was
Phyllis and she cried.

Keillor, stunned and confused, at-
tended first to the injured Phyllis and
only later turned his attention to the
“jerk.” . By then, his anger had
dissipated so he did nothing. That
worried him, and thinking that he
had somehow lost the ability to get
angry and pop someone, he resolved
to hit the next person who so much
as treated him discourteously.

I am not sure who “Phyllis” is in the

A farce being played out between the
5 United States and Libya, but the

cf.‘

Reagan administration sure as
shooting is playing the part of Keillor.
Repeatedly stymied in its avowed at-
tempt to hit back at terrorism (go to

V the source and all of that), it seems

resolved to pop Libya one no matter
what. It seized upon a terrorist inci-
dent directed at Israel (the massacres
at the Vienna and Rome airports),
pointed a finger at Libya and held it
accountable for the murders.

The Europeans were the first to
yell, “Wait a minute.” Having been
asked to end all commerce with
Libya, they asked in return for the
evidence that Libya was, in fact,
responsible for the terrorist incidents.
Nothing doing. Next to pipe up were
the Israelis themselves. The Libyans,
they said, really did harbor terrorists.
But not the ones that struck at the
Rome and Vienna airports. No, said
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
those particular guys come from

‘Syria.

Rabin was quite specific. He said
Israel wassure about the terrorists
who struck in Rome, less certain
about those who went to Vienna. The
ones used in the Rome operation were
trained in Syria. They received their
instructions in Syria and Syria was
their “last stop" before departing for
Europe.

50 then what are the carriers USS
Saratoga and USS Coral Sea doing off
Libya and not off Syria? So then why
is the United States engaged in a war
of words with Moammar Khadafy
and not with Hafez Assad? Why are
American F/A18 and F14 fighters
zooming around the Gulf of Sidra and
not the Syrian coast on the other side
of the Mediterranean?

Well, for one thing, Libya —— as
Rabin reiterated — is a haven for ter-
rorists, and Khadafy is their
paymaster. But the main reason
seems to be the administration's
longstanding desire to pop someone
in the cause of anti-terrorism. It is,

as these things go, a noble sentiment
— who likes Khadafy? — but it would
help if the country being popped were
the same as the one responsible for the
Rome and Vienna murders. In the in-
stant case, as lawyers like to say, this
does not seem to be the case.

So instead of a semi-naked Ram-
bo, we get a costume farce. Khadafy,
dressed alternately as either Michael
Jackson or a Bedouin from Bloom-
ingdale’s, steams out to meet the
American fleet and then,
presumably, steams back. He rants,
he raves, but we, of course, do the
same. This would be mighty good
theater were it not for two facts: We
are really doing nothing about the
real sponsors of the Rome and Vien-
na operations, the much more
menacing Syrians, and we have man-
aged to make Khadafy the darling of
the Arab world. Maybe we should just

. invade Grenada again.

All this would be very funny if it
were not fact that we are perilously

close to repeating the mistake we
made in Lebanon. We have gone
from the perimeter of the crisis to its
very center. Suddenly, a terrorist in-
cident directed at another country has
become our fight —— and, it seems,
ours alone. In Lebanon, that same
impulse to hit back turned us from
peacekeeper to belligerent. That
resulted in the loss of more than 250
lives in the bombing of the Marine
barracks.

The administration's anger at
Khadafy is? understandable, and its
frustration over terrorism is shared by
most Americans. But in its desire to
hit someone, even the wrong one, it

-could make the mistake Garrison

Keiller narrowly avoided when he
finally caught up with the “jerk" who
had creamed Phyllis. By then, his
anger gone and his real motives ap-
parent, he realized something: When
you hit someone for the wrong reason,
it's hard to tell who's the jerk.

and to try to format a plan to put an
end to racism." The racism workshop
is closed to the general public.

Films will play a major part in
honoring black achievements this
February. The black studies depart-
ment, in association with other
groups, is showing 22 films this month
which will address various areas of
black experience. Among the films
shown will be “St. Louis Blues," “Por-
trait of Jason" and “Tallest Tree in
the Forest," the latter ﬁlm being part
of the Paul Robeson tribute.

To encourage feedback on black
history by students, the BAS is spon-
soring an essay contest. The essay
should relate to the theme of Black
History Month: “A Charge for the
'80s: Where to From Here.” The tract
should be 500 to 1000 words, typed
and double spaced, and can be re-
ceived by the BAS Contest Commit-
tee no later than 5 p.m. on Feb. 19.
The contest prize is $50.

The Afro-America‘ History Fair is
the last black history event in
February. Bell, in an article on Black

History Month, said that the Afro-
American History fair “will be a series
of displays depicting the achievements
of blacks in the areas of arts and
entertainment, politics, science and
athletics.” For those not registered to
vote, there will be a voter registration
table, and if interested, you can ‘also
register for "membership in the
NAACP. The fair is on Feb. 28 in the
Student Union Ballroom at 8 p.m.
The Urban League of Pittsburgh is
also observing Black History Month.
At the St. Benedictine the Moor
Church on Feb. 9 at 3 p.m., the Ur-
ban League is presenting a multi-
faceted program of music, oral
presentations and black art by
students from the public schools.
Besides being a celebration of black
history, the Urban League’s Church
fete also marks the Urban League’s
75th anniversary. Director of the Ur-
ban League Leon L. Haley feels that
Black History Month and the Urban
League go hand in hand. Haley said,

Sports Violence

By David James
For the Pitt News

According to attorney Richard
Horrow, violence in professional
sports is a growing problem which can
no longer be ignored. —

Horrow, the executive director of
the Miami-Dade Sports Authority and
the chairman of the American Bar
Association Task Force on Sports
Violence, spoke before a packed
house at the William Pitt Union last
Thursday.

Horrow stressed throughout the lec-
ture that he was not out to halt rough,
agressive play —- just the use of ex-
cessive physical force in sports.

Harrow defined excessive physical
force as force that has no reasonable
relationship to the competitive goals
of the sport, is unreasonably violent
and could not be reasonably foreseen
or consented to by the person
affected.

One of the ways to stop this kind
of violence, Horrow believes, is
federal legislation. He is the author
of two bills currently before the House
of Representitives in Washington.

The PittiNe‘ws, February 3, 1935

The Sports Violence Act’s intent is to
deter athletes from committing these
acts and to punish them with criminal
penalties if they do.

The crowd Thursday night seemed
to disagree during the lecture’s early
moments. Promotions for the lecture
highlighted “explosive ﬁlm footage of
brutal scenes from professional
sports," and the crowd cheered wild-
ly with every punch landed. Horrow
finds that to be a typical reaction.

“I’m not so sure that we’d get as
many people coming to a lecture that
I give if it wasn't for the promoting
of the film," Horrow said. “If you
notice, though, halfway through the
presentation, the applauding of the
violence and the booing of the
elimination of violence died down and
people were more concerned with the
message I was presenting. At the end
of the presentation people are learn-
ing something despite themselves."

The issue of sports violence dgesn’t
rise to the level of child abuse or
nuclear war, said Horrow, but it is
important_.

“The affect of the excessive violence
on kids and the fans is, frankly, the

most important affect that we all
don’t understand when we watch a
sportscast whose main highlight is the
hockey fight." said Horrow.

Kids, according to Horrow,
emulate every move of their sports
heroes. He told the story of a
youngster who wrote a letter to former
Steeler linebacker Jack Lambert. In
the letter the 11-year-old told of a hit
he had put on -an opponent, break-
ing the opponent’s arm in three
places. The youngster said afterwards
he thought of Lambert and smiled.

If violence in sports is to be curtail-
ed it would appear that new measures
of some sort must be implemented,
but the thought of government in-
tervention in sports is unappealing to
Horrow.

“To be honest with you, I hope the
legislation‘ does not pass. I want the
symbol of a threat of intervention to
continue to motivate the leagues as it
has in the past." said Horrow. “If that
symbol does work, then there won7t
be any need for federal intervention,
symbolic or otherwise.”

Med prof Conducts key

By Lori Grandillo
For The Pitt News

Research is being conducted Con-
cerning the development of in-
terferon, a type of antibody which
may be used to treat a variety of viral
infections. _

A leading Pittsburgh doctor,
Frederick Ruben, associate head of
the Infectious Disease Unit,
Montefiore Hospital, and associate
professor of medicine at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
has recently been doing research in
which interferon may be used as a
treatment for inﬂuenza.

Ruben, who received his degree
from Duke University, explained that
interferon is a small protein that
prevents a virus from spreading,
therefore “containing” the infection.
Because the influenza virus rapidly
destroys the respiratory cells, the
disease may quickly spread.

Ruben has been interested in
treating inﬂuenza for the past 13
years, but only about four years ago
did he become involved with in-
terferon as a prospective treatment for
inﬂuenza.

Interferon was expected to be a
“magic wand” to Cure cancer and the
common cold. However, certain
problems arose from its first tentative

Port Authority Transit bus and
trolley operators recorded their
lowest annual accident rate in
1985, making it the safest year in
PAT’s 22-year history, according
to recently released year-end
statistics. ‘

PAT’s drivers averaged only
40.5 traffic accidents per million
milesof operation, a reduction of
14.1 percent from 1984. The pre-
vious record low was made in
1983, when PAT operators

use. First, some people were experien-
cing side effects, such as a bloody
nose, from using the drug. Second, as
Ruben points out, the only method of
producing interferon at that time was
by extracting it from human white
blood cells. This method yielded such
a small amount that interferon
p r o d u C t i o n

proved insufficient and costly. There-
fore, interferon was only occasional-
ly used on cases where the patient's
life might be endangered.

Quite recently, medical science has
made it possible to consider interferon
as a viable method of treating viral
infections. Ruben stated that, today,
bacteria factories are being used as a
means of growing and extracting
interferon.

Furthermore, Ruben explained
that the past side effects produced by
interferon are a result of unnecessary,
prolonged exposure to the treatment.
These people were taking the in-
terferon to prevent Catching a cold,
and these unnecessary precautions
brought on the side effects.

Ruben’s own research has been
narrowed down to finding a Cure for
Inﬂuenza B. He explained that the
difference between the two kinds, In-
ﬂuenza A and B, is that type A is
more widespread over the body than
type B, which tends to be more
localized.

PAT records safest year

recorded 44 accidents permillion
miles.

“The new rate is an outstanding
achievement, given the hazardous
driving conditions in which PAT
operates," said PAT Executive
Director William W. Millar. “The
operators should be commended‘
for their exemplary driving r
performance and concern for
passenger safety.”

Millar said he credited PAT’s

research

In addition, Ruben pointed out
that there already is a known treat-
ment for Inﬂuenza A called aman-
tadine. Ruben also stated that one of
the most remarkable aspects of in-
terferon isthat it is considered a
nonspecific treatment.

This means, for example, that if
someone was treated with interferon
for a certain type of cold virus, then
that person would also be protected
from the many other cold viruses that
exist. He would not have to be ex-
posed to every single cold virus.
Therefore, if Ruben does discover the
interferon treatment for Influenza B,
then, he said, that most probably it
Could be used to treat Inﬂuenza A.
Since Inﬂuenza B is a localized dis-
ease, Ruben said he hopes to produce
a nasal spray once the treatment is
found.

Now Ruben would like to warn
people that inﬂuenza is a very serious
disease. He points out that inﬂuenza
is the fifth leading cause of death
overall in this country, but that the
figures run even higher for young
children and the elderly.

He suspects that an outbreak of In-
ﬂuenza A may hit this area, and if
anyone thinks that they may have it,
there is a treatment for it,
amantadine.

for its effort to promote safe driv-
ing through incentive programs.
An example of this is PAT’s
Chairman's Club which recognizes
operators for accumulating 15
consecutive years of accident-free
driving.

Millar also said PAT buses and
trolleys logged more than 34 mil-
lion miles in 1985.

Reflections

TV and the national trauma

By Jim O’Brien
For the Pitt News

“If you are lucky enough to have
lived in Paris as a young man, then
wherever you go for the rest ofyour
life, it stays with you, for Paris is a
moveable feast. ” _

— Ernest Hemingway

There are moveable feasts and
there are moveable beasts.

Those of us who were students at
the University of Pittsburgh back in
1963 will carry the memory of the
assassination of President John F.
Kennedy with us for the rest of our
lives.

And all of us will do the same with
the space shuttle catastrophe from last
week. Six astronauts and one school
teacher perished when the missile car-
rying them to the stars exploded.

JFK and the astronauts and
teachers have always taken us to the
stars, so they have ajspecial place in
our minds, in our visions. And we saw
them die, right before our eyes, on
television.

Two hundred and fifty-eight
Marines were killed just a few months
ago when a plane crashed in New-
foundland. Yet that didn’t have the
same impact on our psyches as the

space shuttle disaster. So many more ,

American lives were lost, yet it won’t
stay with us the same way. Why?
Because we didn’t see it happen on
TV, that's why.

I returned from a staff meeting in
the Department of Athletics last
Tuesday to find four of five fellow
workers in my office, their eyes glued
to a TV set, and that’s when I learn-
ed of the tragedy.

One of those in the room, Tony
Frasso, was fascinated, befuddled,
frustrated and upset. He turned from
the TV at one point and said to me,
“You've been through this before,
haven’t you?"

Yes, indeed, and it was difficult for
me to realize that none of my interns,
students majoring in communications
at Pitt, Robert Morris and Duquesne,
were alive when JFK was killed.

I was walking past the University
Shop on Forbes Avenue on Nov. 22,
1963 when Phil Werman, a Pitt stu-
dent who worked in the campus
clothing store, raced out the door and
hollered to me, “They shot the presi-
dent!”

I went to the Student Union and
found students, all of them with a
dazed look, many with tears in their
eyes, watching a big TV set, seeing
over and over and over again the
president jerking forward in the car
when he was shot in the head while
riding in a motorcade through the
streets of Dallas.

Sandy Bergad was working in the
University Shop the day JFK was kill-
ed. He's still working there for" owner
Jay McKenzie. When they heard the
news about the space shuttle tragedy

the other day, they went down to the
basement of their store and got a TV
set they have there to watch ball
games. They brought it upstairs.

“It was strange to see the kids look- ’

ing in,” said Bergad. “The kids had
such a look on their faces. It threw me
back to the Kennedy assassination.
That's just the thought I had.”

There are good moments you’ll
remember the rest of your life, too.
Like being a freshman at Pitt in 1960,
and knowing where you were when
Billy Mazeroski hit the home run in
the bottom of the ninth inning to
knock off the mighty New York
Yankees in the seventh and deciding
game of the World Series.

Henry Suffoletta, a friend of mine
and a former Pitt football player and
student, was telling me the other mor-
ning at breakfast that he will always

remember where he was when Don '

Larsen of the Yankees pitched the
perfect game in another World Series.
“You will always be in my memory,
too,” he said.
“Why’s that?” I asked.

“Because you were the one — on
the phone the other day — who first
told me about the space shuttle
catastrophe.”

SenHall blasts sleeping Pitt

Nothing came easy for Pitt on Saturday night.
Here, sophomore forward Charles Smith battles for
a rebound with teammate Darryl Shepherd and
Seton Hall center Mark Bryant.

Dave Hooker/The Pitt News

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Something was wrong. Maybe it
was something in the air Saturday
evening at the Fitzgerald Field House.
But something was drastically wrong.

The always vocal and rowdy Pitt
basketball fans weren't alive. There
was no pre-game excitement. One
could sense that Pitt's sixth man
wasn't prepared to victimize and tor-
ture the opposition as they so often
did in the past. They sat patiently
before the game as if they were in a
daze.

As it turned out, there would not
even be game excitement for the

' sellout crowd. Pitt must have inhal-

ed the same drowsy air the fans did
because they, too, looked like they
were in a dizzy spell as they were but-
chered by lowly Seton Hall, 85-73.

Yes, Seton Hall beat Pitt. Wait,
beat isn't the word — destroyed is
more appropriate. Pitt, ateam that
was supposed to contend for the Big
East conference title this year, has
played mediocre basketball en route
to a 4-5 conference record.

The score was no indication of how
badly the Panthers played. The Pan-
thers played much, much worse.
While running the fast break, they
often resembled a high school team
— a poor one at that.

“It may have been a 12-point game
on the board,” said Pitt head coach
Roy Chipman, “but it was a 30-point
game on the floor. This was my worst
defeat since I've been at Pitt."

‘Pitt was down by as many as 26
points in the second half. They were
never in the contest.

Keep in mind, this is Seton Hall.
Sure, people are saying they have
ﬁnally signed a few good players, and

they have. But they start a freshman

and three sophomores, and they
entered the game 0-7 in the Big East.
And this is the same Seton Hall that
finished 1-15 in the conference last
season. This is the same Seton Hall
team that Pitt beat earlier in the
season in the New Jersey
Meadowlands 81-66.

Lady swimmers dominate

By Gary Geller
Staff Writer

Dominance. The word succinctly '

describes The University of Pittsburgh
women's swim team. Pitt, under the
direction of head coach David
Belowich, is presently ranked first in
the East and 15th in the country. The
women swimmers have not been
beaten since Feb. 12, 1984, when they
lost to Princeton. In contests this year,
Pitt has battered opponents en route
to an impressive ll-0 dual meet
record. In" their most recent
challenge, Pitt took on Villanova and
crushed the Wildcats with superior
performances in every aspect of the
meet.

“We have the strongest team in the '

East," Belowich said. “That's a fact.
I don't think that there's anyone that
can challenge us in the East."

Pitt began the thrashing at the
sound of the opening gun of the
200-yard medley relay. The team of
Tracy Pfister, Wendy Morgan, Cin-
dy Rose and Alicia Dugan captured
the title in a time of 1:52.87. The rout
was on as Pitt led 7-0. In the
1650-yard freestyle, Kathy Bates
swam the race in 18:11.31 as she
grabbed second place.

1' Coach Belowich‘ was happywith

her showing. “She definitely has her
act together." Belowich said. “She's
swimming very well."

The 200-yard freestyle was in-
dicative of the level at which Pitt was
swimming. Tricia Rickert took first in
1:57.13 and Marian Cassidy finished
second in a time of 1:57.85.

Belowich thought the times were a
little slower than normal.

“We weren't as fast as we had been,
but we still had very competitive
times."

The.fourth event, the 100-yard
backstroke, was won by Pfister in a
time of 1:02.44 with Lorraine
Guibord snatching third in 1:04.53.
When Wendy Morgan placed second
in the 100-yard breast stroke with a
time ‘of 1:12.75, the score ballooned
to 28-14.

Judy Haughton breezed to a win in
the 200-yard butterfly in 2:09.40.

“Judy led from start to finish,"
Belowich said. J

Freshman Betsy Holbert also got
into the action and claimed third with
a time of 2:17.35.

"It was one of her lifetime best
times," Belowich said, “Every time she
gets into the water, she gets faster and
faster." '

Pitt placed first and second in the

‘50-yard freestyle when sophomore
"Cindy"Ro“se and senior Alicia Dugan

grabbed top honors with times of
0:25.07 and 0:25.26 respectively, then
it was time for the divers to take the

' spotlight.

- “The divers did a fine job. Their
talents have collectively jelled. I think
we really have a nice group of divers,"
commented Belowich.

Tricia Ney had a score of 257.10
in the one-meter diving and placed
first. Pitt's Jennifer Brown took se-
cond in 243.15 and in the process
made the score a noncompetitive
50-19. The time of 54.51 was good
enough for Pfister to claim first in the
100-yard freestyle, and Rickert grabb-
ed third with 55.15. Marian Cassidy
swam well in the 200-yard backstroke
and finished first in 2:14.56. The
demolition of Villanova continued
when Kathy Bates swam a 5:21.11 to
earn second place and Judy Haughton
swam 5:21.62 to get third in the
500-yard freestyle.

Senior captain Alicia Dugan, asp

Belowich put it, “went out with a
bang" as she was involved in two first-
place finishes and one second-place
finish.

According to Belowich, “Alicia
broke a personal barrier. For the first
time in her career she swam the
100-yard fly in under a minute in a

dual meet. It's‘ _r1i_c_e...to .see_, personal
----high points in the tailiend of a career.

Seton Hall has been the laughing
stock of the conference for years as
teams have constantly beat up on
them. Now, perhaps Pitt will be the
one who will be laughed at as they let
the Pirates, a 10-point underdog,
enter their own gym and not only beat
them, but blow them out. Fitzgerald
Field House is a place even the best
teams in the conference don't like to
play.

But it wasn't the court or the fans
that lost the game. It was the
miserable play by the Panthers.

Chipman must still be scratching
his head, wondering how it could
ha-ppen. How could Seton Hall
destroy Pitt at home? Did Pitt take the
Pirates too lightly?

“Yes we did," said Pitt's Charles
Smith, who fouled out with three
minutes left after scoring only 15
points. “We thought after the loss to
St. John’s that this game would be a
booster for us. This is the lowest point
of the year — they're at the bottom
of the league. Sometimes it takes a
slap in the face to wake you up. That's
what we got tonight.”

Pitt needed more than just a slap
to wake them up as Seton Hall
jumped.out to a 8-0 lead and never
looked back. Pitt slept through a fine
performance by Seton Hall as the
Pirates led 25-10, 40-20 and went in-
to the locker room up 43-24.

“We came out trying to blow them
out instead of setting up our offense,"
Smith said.

“I can remember us actually setting
up our offense in the first half about
two times," added senior point guard
Joey David.

The second half was no better. Pitt
trailed at one point 72-46. And they
didn't cut the lead under 17 points
until the final two minutes.

“In the second half, we kept
waiting for them to make a charge at
us," said Andre McCloud, Seton
Hall's senior forward who scored 16
points.

Pitt never made a run — not even

a stroll.

Seton Hall used some torrid
shooting to grab the big lead. They
shot 77 percent from the ﬁeld in the

‘first half (compared to Pitt's 38 per-

cent), but what was instrumental-, ac-.
cording to Pirates head coach P.J.
Carlesimo,
factor.

“We thought the key was to re-‘

bound,"'Carlesimo said. “We defend-

ed well enough, where even if we a '

didn't shoot 77 percent in the first

half, we would've been in good:

shape.”

In Pitt's win over Seton Hall earlier '
in the season, the Panthers outmus- ' ' ' .

cled the Pirates. But Seton Hall outre-

bounded Pm 15-11 in the first 20. . 
minutes Saturday, holding Smith to _

just two in the process. Pitt outre-
bounded the Pirates in the second
half by four, but the game was
already determined. ,

“We were just totally outplayed,"
Chipman said. “They took it right to
us. They just played harder than we
did. We were never in the basketball
game."

Carlesimo said he thought Pitt-'s
week off after the one—nclnt loss at St.
John's hurt the Panthers more than
it helped them.

“Pitt h:.u seven days to prepare for.
us, and that's too long," Carlesimo
said. “The layoff hurt them. At this
point in the season, players don't want
to go out and practice every day for
two hours. They want to go out and
play games.

Pitt has another full week off.‘

However, this time they won't be
preparing for the patsy of the league
—— they must prepare for Villanova,
the defending national champs. And
they won't have to worry about two-
hour practices for a while as Chipman

said he would cancel a few sessions. .

“I'll give the guys a couple days off

to think about it," said Chipman. ,
“Hopefully they'll respond. Against

Villanova, we will have ﬁve guys on
the court who want to play."

career-high 27 points for Pitt, but 10

Lady Panthers haltskid  

‘By John Enright
Staff Writer

Midway through the second half of
Saturday’s Lady Panthers basketball
game against Seton Hall, a strange
thing happened: head coach Kirk
Bruce sat back in his chair and let out
a huge grin. And why shouldn’t he
have? His Lady Panthers were enjoy-
ing a comfortable lead over the
Bucettes on their way to a 72-59 con-
ference win at Fitzgerald Field House.

The smiles had been few and far
between for Pitt in the month of
January when they posted a 3-6
record. So starting off the month of
February with a victory was reason
enough for jubilation.

Bruce offered similar sentiments:
“If you look back on the last couple
of ball games you wouldn't believe
how big of a win this is for us. I told
the girls after the game. We put our
minds to it tonight. We just said we’re
going to get it done and we did.”

Center jenny Tyner, who scored 10
points, agreed with her coach,
stating, “We needed a win like this.
Everyone played well tonight. We're
starting to play better together as a

group."

The win improved Pitt's overall
record to 8-10 and 4-7 in the con-
ference. Seton Hall fell to a dismal
4-17 overall and 1-10 in the Big East.

The game did not start off well for

Pitt. The Lady Panthers employed a
full-court press, but the Bucettes
handled the pressure and got the ball
into the hands of freshman star
Geraldine Saintilus. Saintilus con-
verted five fast-break baskets to give
Seton Hall a 16-11 lead with 14:30 left
in the half. Bruce called a time-out
to reorganize his defense.

He explained the problem Pitt was
having: “The weak side of our defense
wasn't getting back soon enough. It’s
just a matter of hustle. From there on
I don’t remember them getting a
basket off our press.”

Pitt continued to trail, 32-27, with
six minutes left in the half, but the
Lady Panthers scored the last 11
points of the half to take a 38-32 lead.
In that stretch Pitt's senior guards
Kim Tirik and Kim Gannis took con-
trol, scoring nine of the 11 points.

The Lady Panthers started the se-
cond half with a 10-2 run, stretching
their lead to a commanding 48-34
and putting the game out of Seton
Hall‘s reach. The Bucettes could get
no closer than 11 points the rest of the
game.

Bruce installed a three-guard of-
fense late in the game to run downthe
clock. Tirik, Gannis and sophomore
Valerie Halesworth did a fine job
working the clock, preserving Pitt’s
well-deserved victory.

The Lady Panthers were led in
scoring by Tirik and Gannis with, 19

and 17 points, respectively. Sally
Sheerer and Tyner each pulled down
nine rebounds for Pitt.

Seton Hall was led by Saintilus and
freshman forward Debbie Hartnett.
Saintilus scored 20 points and

grabbed eight rebounds, while Hart- I

nett contributed 14 points and eight
rebounds. Guard Tracy Young chip-
ped in with 10 points off the bench
for the Bucettes.

Pitt does not have time to bask in
the glory of Saturday’s win. Tonight
the Lady Panthers begin a three-
game road trip by travelling to Cor-
aopolis to play Robert Morris in a
7:30 p.m. game.

Bruce is concerned: “We only beat
Robert Morris by two points earlier
in the season [68—66 at the field
house]. They’re going to come after
us, they feel they can beat us."

“We’ve learned our lesson about
going through the motions,” added
Bruce. “When you go through the
motions in division one basketball you
lose." Right on Kirk. just ask the
men’s team.- I V

West debuts at field house

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

This Friday evening will mark the
Fitzgerald Field House debut of
Villanova freshman Doug West, when
the Panthers host the Wildcats in an
8 p.m. game.

West went to Villanova from Al-
toona High School, where he aver-
aged 22 ppg and 11 rpg. He was nam-
ed first team All-State last year and
was the Pennsylvania MVP in the
prestigious Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic. '

West enjoyed anonymity early in
the year until a story appeared in a
Lexington, Ky. newspaper claiming
that West said he was offered $10,000

by a Pitt booster, Dr. Joseph Haller,

to enroll at the university.

Since that time, Pitt head coach
Roy Chipman resigned, effective the
end of the season, the NCAA con-
ducted an investigation into the Pitt
basketball program and Haller

voun umvsnsmr Apnnrmams

Notebook

denied any wrong doing and filed suit
against West.

West would not comment on the
incident.

Pitt fans may look at the loss to_

Seton Hall as an unexpected defeat,
but when you look at how things went
the first time these two teams met this
season (an 81-66 Pitt win at Brendan
Byrne Arena), the loss on Saturday
may have been expected.

In the ﬁrst game, Seton Hall played
without center Mark Bryant and for-
ward Ricky Burton, who were both
out with sprained ankles. While Bur-
ton was ineffective on Saturday,
Bryant was not.

Bryant, a sophomore from South
Orange,  scored 20 points and
grabbed seven rebounds while block-
ing two shots. More importantly, he

has taken some of the pressure off of
Seton Hall’s main man, senior Andre
McCloud.

McCloud was a man among boys
last year at the Seton Hall basketball
practices, but things are a little dif-
ferent this year. He has a supporting
cast and could not be happier.

“I didn’t have too much help last
year,” McCloud recalled. “The
players we did have were young and
were not experienced in the Big East.
They are a year older now, plus we
have some really good freshmen.”

The Pirates start three sophomores,
Martin Salley, James Major and
Bryant, a freshman, Gerald
“General” Greene, and McCloud.

Are the Pirates a year away?

“I’d like to think that we are only
a week away,” head coach P.J.
Carlesimo said. “This is a first step.
We just need to turn the corner now.
If you keep playing hard, you are go-
ing to win.”

“If we just get a couple more good
recruits,” McCloud added, “we are
going to be in pretty good shape.”

Staff Writer

Annapolis —— The Univesity of
Pittsburgh wrestling team upped
its record to 7-0-2 this weekend
with a tri-match victory over Navy
and William & Mary.

The Panthers defeated Navy,

19-14, in the first match. Pitt was -

paced by a strong performance
from freshman Pat Santoro. The
Bethlehem native boosted his
overall record to 21-4, with an
11-6 decision over Craig Dellorso'
of Canonsburg. The 142-pounder
then picked up win number 22

The Panthers defeated the
Tribe 32-8. John Hnath, a native
of Mt. Lebanon, keyed the victory
with an 11-3 win over Mike Hoess.

wrestling at 126 lbs., improved his
record to 22-6.

The Panthers are currently

Pitt gymnasts narrowly defeated by Temple

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

H Senior Tim Koopman led the Tem-
ple Owls to a 267.65 to 262.75 win
over the Pitt Panther gymnasts Friday
evening. The owls dominated the
vault and pommel horse events to
hand Pitt a loss in its first regular
season meet. Temple remains
undefeated.

Koopman racked up 56 points to
defeat Pitt's top all-arounder, Mark
Klafter, who had to settle for a 54.65

- score and second place. Panther Matt

Peters tied Temple's joey Accordino
for third with a score of 53.35.

Pitt's strongest events were the vault
and ﬂoor exercise. The Panthers won
the floor exercise with Klafter, Peters
and Sanchez taking the top three
places. Koopman and Owl Steven
Flanks were close behind, with Koop-
man being underscored on the most
difficult routine shown.

Pitt lost the vault to a strong line-
up of Temple gymnasts, despite
posting their second highest event
total. Pitt looked good on the vault;
Temple just looked better. Owl Chris
Wyatt led all comers with a 9.50 full-
twisting layout Tsukahara. Owl
freshman Michael Dillapena tied
Koopman for second with a 9.35.
Pitt's top finisher was Sanchez, who
placed fourth with a 9.30 Cuervo
vault.

Pitt stayed with Temple on rings
and parallel bars, narrowly defeating
Temple on the former. Klafter finish-
ed first on rings with a 9.40 and tied
Koopman for the parallel bars win
with a 9.45. Temple gymnasts took
the third place spots in both events
but Pitt's depth was encouraging.
junior Ben Rovee was a key gymnast
in both events, scoring 8.90 and 8.75.

Pitt assistant coach Mike Lloyd
described leadoff man Kevin Garren
as “influential in our success.” Gar-
ren is coming back from an injury yet

scored an 8.65 on rings and an 8.85
on parallel bars. '
Pommel horse and high bar were

i the weak events for both teams. Tem-

ple won both, with Pitt registering on-
ly slightly more than an 8.00 average
on pommel horse.

Koopman posted the highest score
of the meet, 9.70, to win pommel
horse. His routine, which included
high Thomas flairs, a perfect hands-
tand dismount with legs seemingly
glued together, was easily the best of
the night.

His teammates, Steven Flaks and
Chris Wyatt, posted 9.25 and 8.65 for
second and third, respectively. Pitt’s
highest scorer was Sanchez with an
8.25, good for fourth place.

Panther Matt Peters won the high
bar with a 9.45 but that was where
the good news ended for Pitt. Pitt
entered only five gymnasts in this
event and thus did not have the usual
luxury of dropping the lowest score.

PIQESENIS:

 

da, who otherwise had a great meet
for Pitt, had to be counted.
Koopman and Accordino tied for
second place behind Peters, scoring
9.10. Koopman’s routine flowed
smoothly throughout, including a
Tkatchev somersault. The most
noticeable error was a poor landing

on his full-twisting double somersault
dismount. His was more difﬁcult than
the other versions shown because the
entire twist was performed during the
second somersault.

‘ Lloyd was especially pleased with
Peters’ routine. “His score was a
perfect score for his difﬁculty.” Peters’
routine included one-arm giant
swings, a Voronin vaultiover the bar,
and a full-twisting double back
somersault dismount and is worth a
9.40, according to Lloyd.

Klafter‘s score would also have been
over 9.00 if it hadn't been for a giant
step on his difficult layout double
back somersault dismount.

Lloyd was exuberant about his
team's performance. “The team uni-
ty is higher than I’ve ever seen it," he

said. “We jumped 10 points from last
week [at the James Madison Invita-
tional]. The guys have been working
out seven days a week since we came
back from Christmas break.”

While it’s still early, Lloyd in-
dicated that Klafter, Peters and San-
chez have “excellent opportunities” to
repeat as NCAA qualifiers. Temple
also appears to have a certain
qualifier in Koopman.

Pitt’s next meet is at home against
Kent State this Saturday.
