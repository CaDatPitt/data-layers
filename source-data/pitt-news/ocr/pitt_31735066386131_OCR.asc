Professor
loses tenure

  over alleged

plagiarism

By Jenifer Crook
Senior sum“ Writer

The tenure of Dr. David Van Thiel,
University of Pittsburgh liver specialist,
has been revoked after a panel of colleagues
found him guilty of plagiarism in a medical
textbook chapter he co—authored.

University officials announced Monday
that Van T hiel lost his faculty tenure, or job
security, on July 1 because he did not
acknowledge his colleagues’ articles which
he used in co-writing a chapter of Diseases
of the Liver, published in 1987.

The ﬁve-member panel ruled that Van
Thiel committed “publication irregularities
which could be considered to be a form of
plagiarism."

Although Van Thiel has been transferred
from his post as chief of the
gastroenterology division of the
department of medicine, university

spokesperson Jane Duffreld said that the V

move was not an additional reprimand but
was Van Thiel’s choice.

“This has absolutely nothing to do with
his tenure loss,” Duffield said. Van Thiel
now works for transplant pioneer Dr.
Thomas Starzl in the department of surgery.

However, Dr. Gerald Levey, chairperson

of the department of medicine, told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette yesterday’ that he
had removed Van Thiel from his
gastroenterology position. Levey, who co-

A wrote one of the articles Van Thiel allegedly

plagiarized, said that the decision to relieve
Van Thiel was made prior to the plagiarism
charges. ~

Van Thiel deniescomrnitting plagiarism
of any ‘kind. According to Dufﬁeld, Van
Thiel “felt he had contributed significantly
to the development of [the articles in
Diseases of the Livevl” since he edited the
original articles, which were published in
Seminars in LiverDisease, a 1985 journal.

Van Thiel has also contended that proper
credit was given to his colleagues for their
writing in the original papers, said Dufﬁeld.

National chapter abolishes
Ploi Sigma Kappa pledging

Byjennifer L. Marshall
For The Pitt News

In a national effort to eliminate hazing
practices associated with pledging, the

Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity abolished its j

V associate-member (pledge) program on
Aug. 8.

The associate-member program is
being replaced with a ‘brotherhood
program" designed to educate members
of the fraternity on an ongoing basis and
give new members all the privileges of
brotherhood. '

. According to Thomas Recker, national
executive vice president of Phi Sigma
Kappa, the move came as a result of
“trying every other alternative to eliminate

‘ hazing.” 1 .

The idea of doing away with the
associate-member program, however, is
not new. “The concept and program
have been talked about for the last three

I years,” he said.

“The new program provides for a more

I president Andy Bruno said, “It’s not really

careful screening and [scrutiny] of
prospective members,” Recker added.

Recker said that he has heard a lot of
positive comments concerning the
acceptance of the decision by local
chapters.

“We would have preferfed to wait
until our 1991 National Copference when
[local chapters] could have voted it in,
but that left a 12-mo/nth window of
hazing,” said Recker.

There were 10 nationally reported
incidents of hazing in Phi Sigma Kappa
chapters last year, according to Recker.

a big change for us. It'll be the same
thing we've’ been doing, only under a

rapist gets
juvenile
sentence

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staff Writer

The 16-year-old charged with the rapes
of two Pitt students in August will serve up
to five years in Shuman Juvenile Center
after pleading guilty in juvenile court
yesterday morning.

Antoine Hamilton was confronted‘ by
the district attorney in the court of Judge
JosephJaffe with evidence linking Hamilton
to charges of burglary, making terroristic

‘ threats, rape, prowling at night, possession
of a weapon and aggravated assault. After
nine victims conﬁrmed the evidence against
him, Hamilton pleaded guilty on all charges.

“Both of the rape charges were very
serious, sol had no problem with [imposing]
the maximum sentence,” said Jaffe.

Hamilton was convicted of the Aug. 28
rape of a student in her Oakland Avenue
apartment He also was convicted of raping
and beating a student in her Ward Street
apartment on Aug. 16.

The maximum sentence for dangerous
juvenile offenses such as Hamilton’s is four
years, butjaffe said that he would hold the
youth in Shuman’s sex-offenders program
until he turns 21, at which point he would
no longer be under the jurisdiction of
juvenile court. -

According to Jaffe, Hamilton’s case ./will
be reviewed every six months by his
probation officer to determine whether he
will actually serve the fifth year.

Hamilton will later face a charge of
attempted rape,.which Jaffe believes will
also be tried in juvenile court. A

Molly Knox, executive I director of
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, said that
her organization views Hamilton’s case
with a mixture of shock at the violence arid
disappointment at how he was tried.

“We believe that the fact that he was tried
as a juvenile was a mistake because the

' nature of his crime was so adult,” said
Knox.

Knox also expressed disappointment at
reports that Hamilton was tried as a juvenile
due to a promise made by a city detective.

For The Pitt News

The 1990-91 school year
marks the end of a career
spanning two decades for Enid
Goldberg, Ph.D., currently the
dean of Pitt’s School of Nursing.

"[Goldberg] has been an
outstanding dean and has done
a great deal to move the School
of Nursing forward,” said
Edison Montgomery, acting
dean of the School of Health
Related Professions.

Goldberg has held the

, improvement in

position of clean since 1973 and
has been a faculty member at
Pitt for over 30 years. She plans
to retire at the end of the spring
term.

According to Montgomery,
Goldberg was responsible for
updating the nursing school's
curriculum. Montgomery said
that Goldberg also recognized
the need for research in all fields,
particularly the medical field,
and she has been able to impress
that need in the minds of all
faculty members. A marked
relations

between the" School of Nursing 1

and the surrounding hospitals 3

is also evident, Montgomery
said.

After graduating from St.
Francis Hospital's School of
Nursing in 1946, Goldberg went
on to obtain her bachelors of

science in nursing education 

and nursing/ psychiatric mental
health in 1950; a masters degree
from the Pitt school of nursing
in 1953, and a doctoral degree
in higher education
administration in 1968, also at
Pitt. She has been a member of

numerous state and national
organizations for nurses,
including both the American
and the Pennsylvania Nursing
Association and the National
and Pennsylvania League for
Nursing. She has participated
in Sigma Theta Tau, Phi Lambda
Theta and Kappa Delta Phi.
Goldberg has also had several

articles published in her ﬁeld of

study.

“That decision is for a judge to make,”
Knox said. "The judge didn't make that
decision.”

Pat Scanlon of South Oakland Citizens
Council was initially disappointed with the
decision to handle Hamilton’s case in
juvenile court but after the sentencing
viewed it as “a blessing in disguise."

She expressed a lack of confidence in
the adult court system's ability to incarcerate
a criminal for the same period of time that
Hamilton was sentenced.

“We’re certainly glad he got the maximum
sentence,” she said. “We’re also glad that

Pitt employees take advantage of cheap credits

By Stephanie Schwertz
For The pa: News

The rising cost of college tuition
often causes students to hunt for
feasible ways to cover the cost of
that semestral blow to the
checking account.

College of Arts and Sciences
administrative assistant Babs
Mowery has lowered the cost of
her college education through the
staff scholarship, an employee
benefit.

The university offers the staff
scholarship to benefit employees
who want to get a college
education.

As a staff member, Mowery is
entitled to take eight credits for $5
a credit each semester. However,
Mowery must pay the activities
and computer- lab fees for part-
time students. V In addition,
Nlowery receives full medical
beneﬁts.

Although it has taken 18 years
for her to graduate, Mowery said
she  no re grets: This December
she will receive her undergraduate

degree in a self-designed major
concentrating on video
production and the humanities.

Cathy Carr, a staff specialist level
III in CA8 advising, has taken
advantage of the education
benefits for six years.

Carr said, “I don’t think it is
worth the double time it took to
complete a degree.” Carr, who is

education they might not
otherwise have had, but that
employees’ first concern should
be their jobs.

Education budget cuts made
during the Reagan administration

wanted to continue in a graduate
program. Now employees must

pursuing a post-baccalaureate
degree in computer science, said,
“You don’t see the disadvantages
when you start out.” 4
Nancy Gilkes, human-
resources manager of beneﬁts,
said the education beneﬁt is a
wonderful opportunity for
employees to receive an

pay income tax on the staff
scholarship, according to Carr.
Carr said her salary is too low to
continue with her graduate
studies. She has chosen to pursue

a post—bacca1aureate degree so ’

that she is not required to pay
income tax on the tuition.
Carr said, “It is discouraging

because it takes so long and the
job also hinders my grades."

Carr said the education beneﬁts
help employees most whose
dependents can attend the
university for $5 a credit. “It is like
a second income saved,” Carr
said. Employees’ dependents can
take a full-time course load per
semester, whereas employees are
only permitted eight credits per
semester. _

Alethea 'Wieland, a staff
specialist III in CA5 student
records, obtained a permanent
part-time position in 1986, making
her eligible for a limited staff
scholarship. Wieland receives two
credits free and must pay for any
credits over and above those two.

Wieland said, “I am pretty
fortunate because when - I
graduate Iwon’t owe any money
whatsoever.” ,

Wieland also noted that her job
has been a learning experience
and an extra boost to help her get
through school. Wieland, who will
graduate in December 1990, has

Pitt researchers link smoking to lung, heart disease

By Lane Hornfeck
For The Pitt News

University of ‘Pittsburgh professors
involved in the Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial, a decade-long study,
have found evidence that smoking is

"definitely linked to lung cancer and
coronary heart disease.

The study, which consisted of trials
conducted on 12,866 men, helped
determine the risks of smokers and non-
smokers contracting lung cancer and
coronary heart disease.

Although there were no female
participants in the study, Dr. Elaine Meilahn

._ of Pitt’s Graduate School of Public Health

said that “lthe results are] likely to be similar
in women, even though it has not been
[proved] by research. So women most likely
benefit from a cessation in smoking, since
the leading ‘cancer death’ in women is
lung cancer.”

The National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute sponsored the study in an effort to
test the effect of a multi-factor intervention
program on mortality from coronary heart
disease and lung cancer.

According to Dr. Lewis Kuller,
chairperson of the department of
epidemiology at GSPH, the study found
that 1 19 deaths were caused by lung cancer
and that each death was reported to be that
of a smoker or an ex—smoker. It was also
found that no lung—cancer deaths occurred
among the 1,859, men who reported to
have never smoked cigarettes.

This study considered factors such as
age, the number of cigarettes smoked per
day, the age at which a participant began
smoking, number of alcoholic drinks per
week, and the amount of tar and nicotine
in the cigarettes smoked. The study

determined that the risk of lung cancer was
definitely increased when the amount of
smoking increased.

According to Meilahn, “Among those
who did quit smoking, the excess risk of

heart disease fell while the risk of lung
cancer persisted.”

The study on coronary heart disease
showed that the risk of dying from coronary
heart disease was greater among smokers

By Renee Crespy
For The Pitt News

Because of a city ordinance, the
University of Pittsburgh has designated
certain campus areas as non-
smoking. ‘

The ordinance calls for
“protecting the public .
health by prohibiting
[smoking] in public
places and by
regulating it in or
places of
employment.” ,

The University
of Pittsburgh has
complied with this
ordinance and has
prohibited smoking in all
classrooms, lecture halls,
laboratories, clinics, libraries, museums,
auditoria, theatres, indoor athletic
facilities, conference rooms, stairwells,
elevators, hallways, common areas of
residence halls, stores and bathrooms.

Ann Jones, Ph.D, interim director of
Pitt’s Affirmative Action Office, said the
only problem with the policy so far is
people having a hard time distinguishing
where they can smoke.

   
   
  
   
     

University limits smoking areas

“No—smoking signs have either fallen,
been ripped down, are too small or
were never posted,” she said.

At least 25 percent of all campus
restaurants, dining rooms, cafeterias and

club facilities must be designated
as non-smoking areas,
according to the
university’s smoking
policy.
Lobbies or
other large, well-
ventilated rooms
have designated
smoking and non-
smoking sections.
In private
offices and residence
halls, smoking is allowed
if the occupants prefer. In
offices or residence halls
occupied by more than one person,
smoking is permitted only with the
consent of all occupants.

Smoking on campus buses and vans
which have regular routes is prohibited.
University motor-pool vehicles,
however, are not covered by this policy.

Jones also stated that the university
has not yet reached the point of
becoming a “no—smoking environment.”

than non-smokers.

“The bottom line is quitting smoking. It
has the extraordinary benefit [of lowering]
the risk of today’s number-one killer of
man, heart disease,” Meilahn said.

Only after a person had stopped smoking
for one year did his or her relative risk of
contracting heart disease decrease
significantly.

According to Meilahn, this information
supports the hypothesis that stopping
smoking remarkably increases the chances
for avoiding coronary heart disease and
lung cancer. Meilahn said, .“Don’t wait to
quit smoking. You havertoquit now to
lower the risk of lung cancer.

“The MRFIT has provided a longer-term
follow-up with a more ~. carefully
documented history than all other studies,”
said Meilahn.

An article in the August 1990 issue of The
American Journal of Public Health
summarized the results of the study as
follows:

-The risk of lung cancer for smokers
increases as the number of cigarettes
smoked increases.

-The risk of coronary heart disease is
greater among smokers than non—smokers.

-After a participant stopped smoking
for a_ one—year period, the relative risk of
dying of coronary heart disease for the
quitters as compared to the non—quitters
was significantly reduced.

“[Thisl da'ta supports the importance of
never smoking or quitting if you do,” said
Kuller. -

The MRFIT study was conducted by
researchers at Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health, the University of
Massachusetts Medical School and the
University of Minnesota School of Public
Health.

Pitt student's parents narrowly escape Kuwait

By Amy Dilvlarco
stag’ Writer

Many Americans will not
personally be affected by the
present situation in Kuwait. That
is not the case for Publio Briones,
a Pitt student whose family was in
Kuwait at the time of the invasion.

Besides his sister, a student at
the University of San Francisco,
his parents and two younger
brothers lived in Kuwait.

During the ﬁrst three days of
the invasion, the Brioneses had
the opportunity to get out of the
country, but reluctant to leave the

home they had just purchased a :
few months earlier, decided to '

wait the crisis out in hopes that it
would soon be resolved.
According to Mrs. Briones, the
first signs of hardship emerged
‘within a week of the invasion.
The family decided to leave the
country by the second week,
when the food and water shortage
had become apparent and there
was talk of invading soldiers
pillaging households, looting
stores for supplies and raping
citizens. -.

The Brioneses were the only
Asian family in the condominium
complex in which they lived; the
rest of the families were American.
This was cause for more alarm
when Saddam Hussein ordered
the Americans to convene so they
could be “rounded up” more
easily. Although these Americans
ignored Hussein’s orders, the

 

Brioneses left at once, hiding in
the basement of a friend's house
and sneaking out that night. The
three and a half weeks that
followed were an exhausting
nightmare for the family. ,
Joining a convoy of other
Filipino families trying to leave
Kuwait, they attempted to travel

 

Iraq -My Kuwait

across the desert to the Saudi
Arabian border. Unfortunately,
the soldiers there wouldn’t allow
them to get past.

The second attempt at freedom
ended tragically when the child
of a family that was escaping died
suddenly of heatstroke. The
convoy decided to travel at night
from then on to avoid the intense
heat.

Driving at night through the
desert without the aid of highway
lighting proved to be extremely
difficult on their third attempt to
escape, when the convoy got lost
in the desert on its way across
Iraq, through which they hoped

Briones said his mother described
it as having “every square inch of
space filled [with people], like a
refugee camp.” After they got
supplies, the family turned west
to the Jordanian border. The trip
there from Baghdad took four
nights, during which time they
had no food. They arrived in
Jordan at 2 a.m., butwere held for
over 18 hours before they were
allowed to cross the border.

They were only allowed one
small suitcase each and were
carrying a total of only $200 in
cash at the time.

Upon being instructed to pack
only enough to fill one suitcase,
Briones’ sister sacrificed some of
her space to bring her brother
Publio a bag of photographs he’d
accumulated throughout his life.

“She thought it was sad that the
soldiers might ransack the house
and those pictures would be lost
forever,” he said.

The $200 was not a large sum;
previously, the exchange rate had
been 6 Kuwaiti dinar for every 1
Iraqi dinar. With the invasion, the
rate suddenly plunged to a 1:1
exchange. Since Kuwaiti dinar is
spendable only in’ Kuwait and
Iraq, this money was useless

anyway.

The Brioneses stayed injordan
for a week while they waited for
a plane to arrive to rescue the
Philippines—bound evacuees. The
family contacted Briones’
grandmother, who wired them
money so they would be able to
stay in a hotel.

The family is now living safely
in the Philippines.‘ Briones said
that although he was out of danger
and in the United States the whole
time, “It was awful for three and a
half weeks not to hear a word
from myfamily, wondering if they
were even alive.”

Someday the family may be able
to return to Kuwait. The company
for which Briones’ father is a
banker may relocate to Bahrain,
an archipelago country south of
Kuwait, after three months.
However, there is no guarantee
that their house or any of its
contents will still be intact.

Briones was supposed to
accompany his sister on her trip
to Kuwait to visit their parents but
opted to stay at Pitt to take summer
classes instead. H

“Talk about a wise decision,”
Briones said.

Briones, who was born in the
Philippines and spent the first 10
years of his life there, completed
high school in Kuwait.

Briones had visited the United
States during three different
summers before finally moving
here in 1988 to attend Pitt.

Activist urges student involvement

By Eric Hoch
Sta1fTVriter

Student activists must make a
change in order to be effective in
finding solutions to today’s
problems, according to local
activist Vince Eirene.

“T oday’s students are bored
with ideologies,” Eirene said.
“They want to see action; they
want to see and make [good]
things happen and bad things
end.”

In Eirene’s opinion, this can
only happen through
experimentation, and Pittsburgh
is an excellent place to try new
forms of activism.

According to Eirene, Pittsburgh
is a small city with many big—city
problems such as homelessness.

Eirene is also concerned with
-the militarization of Carnegie
Mellon University. Eirene protests
against nuclear—weapons research
at CMU’s Software Engineering
Institute.

“For example,” Eirene said, "I
run an art show [to benefit] the
homeless every first week of
December. And instead of one—
day protests at places like SE1, my
friends and I have week—long
vigils when we live out in front of
the institute, and during that time
period we usually hold a rally as
well.”

Eirene believes another reason
that student activism needs to
change is that it has become more
expensive to go to college.

“When I went to college in 1974,
five other people and myself
rented a six—bedroom house for
which the total rent was $150. For
rent, utilities and food, it cost us

only $40 each for one month,”

Eirene said. “But today, that $1 50

- would not even pay off a sizable

proportion of the total cost of
living at college.” ,’
Because of this, there are less
students coming to college, and
of those who do, many have not
expressed an interest in getting

 

concern, and compassion in
students is growing in the youth
of today.” Eirene continued, ‘‘I
have found that students are
responsive, and that they have
helped in various soup kitchens
around the city. They have helped
out with many action groups that
take special interests in problems
that are in our community.”

Born in Pittsburgh, Eirene
attended Upper St. Clair High
School. It was during this time
that he started to become involved
with activism, especially against
the Vietnam War.

From 1971 to 1975, he attended
Ohio State University and got his
degree in education and the social
sciences.

Though he does not teach in
the classroom, Eirene said that he
tries to teach many people
through his actions and through
word of mouth.

raising funds for charity, Eirene ,

Congress is soon going to vote on whether the NEA should stay in
existence, be abolished or stay in existence with certain restrictions
about what kindof art it can support. '

Senator Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is leading the fight against the NEA
based on the work of two artists. Helms wants to abolish legislation
which has helped to support thousands of artists, museums, dance
and theater companies, etc. for the past 25 years based on the work of
two artists: Andres Serrano and the late Robert Mapplethorpe.

Mapplethorpe’s exhibition contained a few photographs with
homoerotic content which some viewers found obscene.

Serrano’s work of art is entitled “Piss Christ.” It is a photograph of
a crucifix submerged in the artist’s urine.

put a full-page ad in the Pittsburgh Press on July 22. Among these were
the Carnegie Museum of Art, the City Theater Company, Pittsburgh
Filmmakers and the Carnegie Mellon Drama. These are all based in
Oakland and could be facing serious situations if the NEA were
abolished, according to Dorinda Hughes from Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

Hughes said, “We [Pittsburgh Filmmakers] urged all of our members
to participate in a letter-writing campaign. We providedinformation
to members, students and patrons of our arts organization and other
arts organizations in our area and nationwide on what they should do
and what their options are. We provided letter-writing materials so
people could get in touch -with their congressmen and senators to let
them know how they feel about the issue.”

Some Pitt students will be affected directly, since many students
take classes at Pittsburgh Filmmakers through Pitt.

Hughes said, “We do get a lot of people from [the College of General
Studies] and [the College of Arts and Sciences] as students. Our
education program and our entire organization is non—proﬁt. So when
a CAS or"CGS student enrolls in one of the classes, Pitt pays us a
percentage of the money to receive one of those students in. Those
students use our facilities to produce artwork — either photography,

Prepa redfor the worst?

The city of Pittsburghwatched a man shoot himself and
fall to his death last Friday. They couldn’t do ‘anything
about it because no one in the Pittsburgh Police Department
was trained to handle the situation. »

The PPD hasn’t had a trained negotiator since the last
one retired of -this year. The department had to rely on

C Police Chief Mayer DeRoy and three other men to attempt

to talk Paul Fisher down from his perch.
But a city this size should have properly trained people

When the city suffered from the recession of the mid-.
80s, cuts had to be made. Many departments, including
the negotiating team, took heavy losses. and were taken.
out of existence. _ _

. Unfortunately it took a tragic incident of this nature to
show just how inadequately prepared the police
department is for thesesituations.

If the city cannot properlytrain people to do this, then,
it could send them to the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va.,‘

iwhere there are classes designed especially to teach

negotiating procedures.

DeRoy attempted to contact people for background
material for a situation like this one just last week. He
should never have had to do this. The city should already
have been prepared for it.

The city of Pittsburgh has seen once how completely
unprepared it is for an emergency like this. Hopefully this
situation will be rectified ' before another serious one
comes along, one which will cost more than just one life.

Return to

I had the unique experiencelof
studying in Eastern Europe this
summer. I had a great time, and I
met a1l_sorts of wonderful people.
So what’s ‘my problem? My
problem is that I am suffering
from culture shodc, not from being
in Europe, but from returning to

‘ the United States.
Everyone who had ever studied ‘

abroad warned me that going to a
foreign country was easy but
returning to the United States
wouldbe difficult. Ihate to admit
it, but everyone was right.

I had this perception that
everyone
would be untouched by Western
civilization. I had visions of people
who farmed the land and who
had no interest in the outside
world. But I was only partly
Correct

I spent some time inthe village
where my grandmother was born.
My cousin, who is 22, was
probably more into Western
society than_I was. We both had
the same ‘Depeche Mode tapes,
and we both liked to drink

‘champagne. We seemed to have

so much in common — until we

discussed our philosophies of life.
“What do you want most from

your life?” my cousin asked.
“That’s easy,” I replied. "I want

H, a job that pays well and that

challenges me. I want a nice car,
good health and vacations to‘
exotic places. Basically, I want
the American dream.” I saw
nothing wrong with my reply. I
would hope that all my time and
hard work at college would
eventually pay off.

My cousin immediately started
to laugh at me. He told me that I
was a communist. That really
bothered me. “I am not a
communist, you jerk; I am a
capitalist,” I retorted. “Why would
you ever say such a horrible thing
about me?”

He explained to me that the

Communist Party's biggest’

concerns were industrialization,
military buildup and what could
be done for the govemment/-

in Czechoslovakia ‘

U.S. a culture shock

not what could be done to help
the people. He told me, “As long
as you don’t care_for anyone else
and don’t try to help anyone, then
you truly should be a communist.”
We both grew silent as he made
his point. I grew up with
everything that I had ever needed.
My mother and father always tried
to provide us with many material‘
possessions. But before I left for
Europe, I discovered that my
mother would have to be
hospitalized because of a

  Jacinta
Dvorak

malignancy. I had all the material
possessions that I wanted, but I
did not have any control over
something that truly mattered to
me — my mother's health.

I think often of this conversation
with my cousin. In Europe I lived
among people who didn’t have
compact-disc players, televisions
and VCRs. They hadn't had the
experience of going into an
appliance store and knowing that
they could purchase something
on their Master Card or Visa.

I watched the whole village get
together and plan to build a house
for some young newlyweds. They
also showed me that years of
communism didn’t ruin their
values. They still attend ‘church,
care for their families and still
have a love for the arts. I know a
lot of Americans who don’t care
about these things.

My cousin taught me that
material wealth isn't everything.
My " biggest complaint ‘a few
months ago was Pitt dorm food.
In Czechoslovakia I survived
when I had to eat a chicken that I
watched my aunt kill. When I first
got back to the United States, I
was shocked to see all the food in
the deli section of

supermarket. I never thought it

was a big deal before I went .

abroad. I had always taken this
for granted. Here I could literally
buy whatever I wanted, and there
I couldn’t buy anything. And, I
had the money.

I still can’t get over Oakland’s
busy streets" and the fast-paced
American way of life. The people
in Czechoslovakia seemed to pay
less attention to corporate politics
and more attention to life. Being
educated and having a job is
important, but stepping on

someone to get ‘to the top isn’t. ,

Opportunists, I was told, are
communists.

I feel as though I have too much.
I carried around a Camcorder
recording a lot of life and culture.
Little did I know that my
Camcorder was the equivalent of
a doctor's yearly salary over there.
I really can’t imagine getting paid
the equivalent of $60 a month and
surviving on it. These people had
a different attitude about money.
As Americans, we always strive to
have more. Others are more
satisfied with what life has to offer,
not with what new toy their money
can buy.

Before I left, I handed my cousin
my Sports Walkman. It’s really
ironic that .I did that, considering
I had yelled at my younger sister
the week before for borrowing it.
I thought that my Walkman was
so important. I thought that I
would die without having a
constant source of music. Now I
am surviving without it.

I want to change my life to the
point where I can enjoy it now
and not always have to look for
tomorrow to be a better day. I
want material possessions to
mean less and people to mean
more. I hope thatI can learn to do
all this before my culture shock
wears off.

_ Tradition, rivalry, revenge — The intangibles that make certain
college football games special. ‘

Traveling to Norman, Okla., to take on a Sooner squad known for
its continuing excellence in college football in front of exactly 75,004
fans making up the sellout crowd (and on national television) is also

To play in this type of game is the reason a football player chooses

make Saturday's football game interesting

Even if one tried, it would be mathematically unfeasible to simulate
‘Oklahoma. Pitt Stadium holds 56,500 people, and Three Rivers Stadium
can accommodate approximately 59,000. Fill either stadium for any
Pitt game (hypothetically, of course), and you will still fall about
18,000 short of Oklahoma Memorial.

The crowd. .A big factor indeed. .

The weather will also wreak a little havoc if Oklahoma sticks to its
usual heat pattern. Panther right tackle Scott Miller said he heard it was
almost 120 degrees in Norman last week. Coming from Pittsburgh, not
traditionally known for such tropical conditions, local players, used to
maximum highs in the 80s and occasionally the 90s, could ﬁnd the heat
to be a big factor.

If that is why these young men come to Pitt, they will all ﬁnally get “You try to approach every game the same way; once you get there,

in touch with that reason on Saturday.

Sure, both schools have ﬁelded their share of excellent teams and
players over the years. (Tradition.) Sure, both football programs
always intensely look forward to playing each other whenever they
get the chance. (Rivalry.) And the Panthers are 1-8-1 lifetime against
Oklahoma. (Revenge) .

However, Pitt is determined to keep its feet on the ground in spite
of the above-mentioned intangibles.

In fact, Hackett will go so far as to simulate crowd noise in practices
this week in order to prepare the team fo.r the mayhem at Oklahoma
Memorial Stadium.

“The crowd and the weather and the whole anxiety level all have to
do with the intensity of the game. Ninety-ﬁve thousand people in red
and white — that’s what we have to deal with in a very mechanical

, way,” Hackett said. “There's 35,000 here; there's 95,000 down there.

It's a different scene, and you can't prepare for it all that well because
you can't build that situation up here.”

you try to let the atmosphere take care of everything else. But you get
so caught up in the atmosphere and everything around you, all the
hype. This is just a great thing for college football," said ‘tight end Eric
Seaman.

Junior fullback Carl Hagins, a ﬁfth-string walk-on who started
against the Eagles due to the injuries of and a one-game suspension
issued to starter Derrick" Lewis for missing practice, is concerned with
victory. Equally important as a mark in the win column is the general
conﬁdence high the young Panther team may achieve if victorious.

“After our two wins, the team has confidence on both offense and
defense. But getting a win against Oklahoma would just add to the
conﬁdence we already have. That’s one of the biggest things we
should try to accomplish Saturday,” Hagins said.

But the Panthers must deal with Oklahoma’s monstrous defensive
line, well-trained defense and exceptional speed in a unique Option-
I offense before celebrating. But more on that tomorrow.

Picklo
poised
for finale

By Michael Milliron
Stajf Writer

Three years ago Theresa
Picklo joined the Lady
Panthers swimming team,
after achieving All-State

honors in the 200- and 500-

yard freestyle competitions

swimming for Plum High
School. While‘Picklo has
had an illustrious three
years at «the University of
Pittsburgh, she is looking
to attain the All-American
honors this season and
make the team national

champions-

Picklo, a senior, will
provide leadership by
example for the Lady

Panthers this year. “She is a

as hard-working an athlete
as I’ve ever coached," said
Coach Dave Belowich.

The team endures
grueling workouts in
preparation for the season.
On Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays the team begins
its day at 6 a.m. with about
an hour of weightlifting,
followed by 30 minutes of
aerobics and 10 to 12 sprints
up Oakland hills. Finally,
the Lady Panthers push
Belowich’s car back and
forth in front of Fitzgerald
Field House as quickly as
possible.

Like the Army, the Lady
Panthers do more by 8 a.m.
than most people do all day.
Tuesdays and Thursdays
they are in their rightful

place, the pool, from 3:30 .

to 5:30 p.m. Distance
swimmers like Picklo will

‘swim 8,000 to 8,500 yards,

while short-distance
athletes will do about 7,000
yards. They also spend
three hours in the water on
Saturdays from .8 to 11'a.m.
Last season at Easterns,

Picklo finished second in
the 500-yard free with a time
of 4:51.41, and missed the -
NCAA cut by about 1.5
seconds. She also placed
third in the 1,650 free with
a time of 16:49.50. She had
to adjust to the 1,650-yard
distance event when she
moved up to the college
level. The maximum
distance in any high-school
event is 500 yards; the 1,650
is more than triple that.
Picklo has taken about a
minute off her time in the
1,650 since arriving at Pitt
and about nine seconds off
her 500 time. “Her progress
has been quite remarkable,”
said Belowich.

Embarassment 

Lady Panther volleyball wb ips Du/ees,
allows only five points in three games

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ“ Wﬁter

The Pitt Lady Panthers volleyball team continued to roll along,
raising their record to 6-1, as it blew away the Duquesne Duchesses
(2-3) last night at the Fitzgerald _Field House. The Duchesses were
simply outclassed., overpowered, outquicked, and their fundamentals
weren't very good either. They seemed unable to even get a decent
set,and they only had 10 kills, compared to 37 for Pitt.

The final scoring was 15-1, 15-2, 15-2. The game only lasted 49
minutes. The game was attended by only 40 people, but it was taped
by GTV Sports and will be televised at a later date by the KBL
television network.

The team had a lot of errors, and had an especially hard time
scoring the last point of the game. Their hitting percentage was only
.325, outstanding against a good team, but not against a lesser team
like Duquesne. Duquesne’s hitting percentage was negative .083.
Not one of the Duchesses’ players had a percentage above .000.

After the Duchesses scored the ﬁrst point of the first game, Senior
setter Jenelle Lantagne, junior middle hitter Susan Zonneville, and
Senior outside hitter Dee MacAuley took over. MacAuley lead the
team with 13 kills, Zonneville had five and made some outstanding
plays. Lantagne led the team with 30 assists. Lantagne also tricked
the Duchesses four times by faking a pass and tipping the ball over
the net, and none of those balls were returned.

A major worry of Coach Sue Woodstra going into the match was
concentration. Erratic play was a problem for the team in the Pitt
Tournament held last weekend, especially in the last match against
Kent State, when erratic play by Pitt kept the last two games close.

Except for the first and last points of the game, the team seemed
focused, even though they continue to be a very loose group.
Evidence of their intensity was their getting 42 digs compared to only
30 for Duquesne. They had only 30 digs against Kent State and only

19 in the first game of the Pitt Tournament against Eastern Kentucky.
MacAuley lead the team in digs with 9.

The playing time of Ann Marie Lucanie, the talented freshman
She sat out the
entire second game, with junior outside hitter Bridget Gary playing
in her place. Gary, Macauley, Senior outside hitter Michelle
Adarnson, and junior outside hitter Shelly Seanor more than made up
for‘ Lucanie’s reduced playing time. Junior outside hitter Heather
Hollands came up with some good front line plays in the third game.

PITT BITS: When asked about the conditionof Lucanie, Woodstra
said, “It’s minor. The ice on her shoulder is only a precaution.” 
Freshman middle hitter Carrie Thornton, who returned from a knee
problem for the Pitt Tournament, participated in pre-game warm-
ups, but did not play  The Lady Panthers head west this weekend
for the Minnesota Tournament.

Mens tennis blows by,Faz'rmom‘ St.

By Paul Tatkovski
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt football team used Ohio U., the men's
tennis team used Fairmont State.

We are, of course,‘ talking about your average,
inaugural, blast-them-out-of-the-furnace,
cakewalk win.

Pitt, yielded only 25 games in 18 sets en route
to their overwhelming 9-0 victory. Head coach
George Dieffenbach admits this was just a warm-
up. “I had an idea going in we were overmatched
against them. It was a good tune—up before we
go to the Big East tournament.”

No. 1 Terrence Rosenthal handled Tom Collins
in straight sets 6-1, 6-2. John Tegano, who
leaped three spots up from last year to No. 2,
defeated Sergio Mucino 6-1, 6-2.

No. 3 Eric Weaver, a sophomore transfer from
Elon College in North Carolina, won 6-2, 6-1. No.

opponent, winning 6-1, 6-2.

Doubles action produced the same results.
The No. 1 team of Rosenthal and Mills had little
trouble with Collins and Mucino, 6-0, 6-2. No. 2
team, Ginder and Garrard exacted .their
teammates with another 6-0, 6-2 victory. And
finally the No. 3 team having a small test in their
first set, closed out the day with a 7-5, 6-2, in
preserving Pitt’s shutout. _

Dieffenbach added, “Their [Fairmont State]
program has taken a turn for the worst, while our
program has taken a turn for the better.” He said
the win will give the players a positive outlook
for this weekends Big East tournament.

“We have good team unity and spirit. The
players are a credit to the university,” said
Dieffenbach. _ I ‘

In playing this easy match, Dieffenbach said,
“We used this chance to work out some of our
weaknesses." Dieffenbach is hoping toequal or

4 Jeff Mills cruised in a 6-1, 6-0 win. No. 5 David better last year's impressive 12-6 finish. He said

Ginder duplicated Mills 6-1, 6-0. And Larry
Garrard at No. 6 had made easy work of his

this year's schedule is tougher than last year, but
he is pleased with the team he has assembled.

styles of play that college coaches
take notice of, Jerry responded
by saying, “In high school, you
have to play-with the hand dealt
to you; whereas, in college you
recruit kids to come in and ﬁll the
voids. Philosophically, ‘my brother
and I implement similar methods
of coaching, although there are
quite a few differences.”

The attraction to Pitt goes
beyond Luxbacher, though. John
Lopus was attracted to the
excellent engineering department
here, as well as the opportunity to
play Big East soccer. “The
attraction to Pitt was a culmination
of things, but being close to home
and playing with familiar faces,
along with the ﬁnancial package
offered, was a hard thing to turn
down.” he said.

While the financial aspect
played a part in all the players’
Commitment to Pitt, playing
alongside friends and familiar
styles were the overriding factors

_ to come here.

Joe Luxbacher has established 
western °
Pennsylvania players and coaches 
as an excellent assessor of talent 
and molding it into his style of 
play. Many football coaches are 
envious of his domination of area 
recruiting but getting the Peters 
Twp. players is a bit easier since 
the kids look up to players such 
as McCurry, Kapusta and Perdue. 3
When the occasion comes for the 
hi gh-school booters to make their 
decision, the Peters Twp. players 
almost always consider Pitt among 

himself among

their choices.

So the “pipeline” continues, and 
Pitt appears to be making a stand 
in the Big East with local talent. 
The day when Pitt soccer is 
regarded as a power may be just 
a few years away, and right in the 
middle of it will be the kids from 
Peters Twp. When the season 
ends and “normal” college life 
beckons, you might ﬁnd some of 
the players at a local establishment 

called Peter’s Pub.
