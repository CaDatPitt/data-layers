Former Pitt provost emphasizes education

By Cameron Harvey
Staﬂ’ Writer

Amid the grandeur of Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall Auditorium and the
caps and gowns of the student and faculty
honorees, Dr. Donald Henderson gave
some advice after accepting his honorary
Doctorate of Letters at yesterday’s Honors
Convocation.

Fomier Pitt Provost Henderson advised
that we “appropriately educate our
young. The education of the young peo-
ple in our society is the most important
and essential of the society’s responsibili-
ties.

“They must not, must not, must not be
compromised,” he said.

“Consequently, there are some bottom-
line things that we simply cannot afford to
set aside.”

Henderson said he believes our univer-
sities are the best in the world but that we
should be careful not to “overindulge in
wailing and in breast feeding. We should
also resist the temptation to overindulge
in bottom—line thinking.

“I don’t believe that this society fully
appreciates the importance of this funda-
mental social requirement [of educating
our young]. And I worry that we at the
academy are beginning to feel the same
way. That is why bottom—line thinking
scares me.”

To illustrate this point, Henderson
pointed to the decrease in funds for col-
lege and university libraries to use for
buying books.

This, Henderson said, is “woefully ill-
advised” and is a “stupid short-cut  We

As part of Jewish Awareness Wegk,

the Hillel Foundation and the Rosh Ho-
desh group, a Jewish Women’s discussion
group at the University of Pittsburgh, spon-
sored “Jewish Women, Heroes and
Daughters” last night in David Lawrence
Hall.

Guest speakers at the discussion were
Rabbi Sharyn Henry from the Temple Ohav
Shalom, Sylvia Busis, a community activist,
and student speaker Esther Wisner, a senior
at the University of Pittsburgh.

“I though it was important to have at least
one lecture on Jewish women’s history.
When we get Jewish education, we really
don’t receive a lot about women,” said
Wisner.

This is the seventh of eight Jewish events
this week, according to Art Donsky,
Executive director of Hillel.

Henry focused her part of the discussion
on women’s roles in the Bible.

“Over the past 10 years we [Jewish
women] have tried to bring out women’s
voices in the Bible which have traditionally
been muted,” she said.

Henry stressed that it is interesting to look

at women in “non-male situations.” She
focused on women whose situations she
said are not usually mentioned in reference
to the Bible.

“Esther, who is usually not referred to,
was probably a very assimilated woman.
After all, Esther is not a Jewish name. She
got married to the king so she could help
through the system,” she said.

“Most people today are like Esther --
they believe they have to work within the
system. Some believe you have to transform
from the outside,” Henry said.

Brigadier

speaks to
Pitt ROTC

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Be all that you can be.

That is what Brig. Gen.
Thomas J. Konitzer, the regional
commander of Pitt’s ROTC
force, wants out of his cadets.
Konitzer, who is responsible for
ROTC programs from “Florida
to Maine," visited Pitt yesterday
to give his State of the Army
address.

“The biggest challenge is to
provide officers to the U.S.
Army that are of the highest
quality,” Konitzer said.

ROTC, on a national level,
can provide up to 4,500 officers
to be commissioned for the
army each year. According to
Konitzer, the responsibility of
getting top-notch soldiers is
peaking now because of the
federal plan to downsize the
army.

Along with the decreasing
size, there is a decrease in funds
available to recruit for ROTC.
Konitzer said this raises the
importance of an urban—area
school like Pitt.

“The decreasing money
requires that a partnership and a
team effort [be involved] to
ensure that everyone has an
equal opportunity to the pro-
grams offered by ROTC,”
Konitzer said.

Many Pitt students have
already begun to seize these
opportunities by joining ROTC.

“I’ve always wanted to be in
the army, and I wanted to get a
college education,” Pitt sopho-
more Bob Fraas said.

A big advantage to many
Pitt ROTC students is the
tuition break that they get
from the army. According
to Maj. Bev Ertman, ROTC
scholarships can pay for tuition
and books, along with a

Women's Studies sponsors forum on pro—choice options

By Jennifer Sikora
Staff Writer

Every time an anti-abortion
law goes into effect, the cost of
abortion goes up, said Ruth
Colker, a lawyer who worked
on abortion cases in Louisiana
and Mississippi. “The tactic
ofthe 1990s is not to make
abortion illegal but unavail-
able.”

‘Illegal abortions, govemmen—
tal interference in women’s

rights and attacks against abor-
tion clinics and patients were all
issues brought up in Monday
night’s Women’s Studies Forum,
“Pro-Choice Options for the
19905.”

With Pennsy1vania’s new
abortion law taking effect on
midnight March 19, three
women spoke at Pitt’s Law
School about their predictions
on how abortion services will
be affected.

The Pennsylvania law

enforces a 24-hour waiting peri-
od after a woman’s initial visit
with a doctor. During that time,
the doctor must provide infor-
mation about fetal development
and alternatives to abortion.

Colker said the waiting period
is not problematic in theory, but
its intention is only to decrease
the number of abortions rather
than give a woman more time
to think.

Abortions performed on
women under the age of 18 will

also be illegal unless parental
consent or court approval is
provided. At least one parent
must attend all doctor visits
with the minor.

“We’ve seen most of our
patients very angry and their
families very angry that they
have to deal with this,” said
Annette Kolski—Andreaco, direc-
tor of Women’s Health Services.
Women’s Health Services is a
non—profit provider of abortion
services for women who can

not afford the services.

Kolski-Andreaco said patients
must be informed orally by the
physician about the nature of
the abortion, status of the fetus
and medical risks involved.
Also, abortion providers must
give all patients a free copy of
state—published materials about
abortion laws and fetal devel-
opment.

“The Devil is in the details,”
she said. “The law is written so

Anthropology Club provides forum for students

By Jonathan Hayes
For Tbe Pitt News

As many undergraduates are aware,
majoring in anthropology offers few career
guarantees — which poses a daunting
obstacle for students interested in pursuing
this major. '

Thus, the anthropology club was formed
to provide students with a forum for intel-
lectual anthropological discussion, an
opportunity to learn about careers in

anthropology and a chance to have. a lot of
fun.

“A lot of people think we go dig in the
dirt, and that’s it,” said club member
Michele Montag. _

But she said the club offers its members
many opportunities to expand upon regular
classwork with career colloquiums and
field trips.

Sayf Sharif, president of the club, said the
career colloquiums “give undergraduates
an opportunity to see what they can do”

when they graduate. He said speakers have
represented the diverse range of work
involving people with anthropology
degrees.

He said guests have spoken to the
club about contract archaeology, “gra-
duate school, public health and the Peace
Corps.” He also described the colloquiums
as a prelude to networking, because they
allow great discussion within and also
beyond the club.

Peace-ing It Together focuses onlrnulticulturalism,

By Jennifer McGinnis
For The Pitt News

At their presentation on multi-
culturalism Monday night,
members of the student group
Peace-ing It Together urged stu-
dents to “put intellectualism in a
bag.”

Group member Ed Crist asked
students to‘try to tap into the
emotions that they feel about
issues such as bigotry, oppres-
sion, hatred and ignorance,
rather than trying to make deci-
sions about what is right or
wrong.

Peace-ing It Together used
a combination of popular
film clips, music from bands
like “The Smiths,” segments
from television documentaries
and skits performed by
the group to try to make people
think about multicultural is-
sues. /

Homophobia, racism, sexism
and anti-semitism were the
main areas of focus in the _pre—
sentation. Peace-ing It Together
members defined each Of these
issues and read frequently-
heard misconceptions people
hold regarding these issues,
along with poetry written by or
about membersgof different
minority groups.

After the program, the audi-
ence broke into small groups
with members of Peace-ing It

Together and discussed the pro-
gram and their own experiences
with multicultural issues.

Peace-ing Together member
Brad Heffner said the main goal
of the group is to “raise aware-
ness” Of multiculturalism in stu-
dents.

Another member, Geetha
Rao, encouraged people
who had seen the program to
take action when they saw or
heard things going on that upset
them.

Rao, a resident assistant in
Brackenridge Hall, said she has
frequently seen posters put up
by groups like the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance either
torn down or defaced.

Heffner said he has also seen
offensive things around cam-
pus, including a swastika that
has been painted in an elevator
in Lothrop Hall.

“One person can do so much
 If you see something offen-
sive on a wall, erase it. If you
hear something offensive, con-
front it  You have to be coura-
geous,” said Rao.

Peace-ing It Together hopes
to take its performance on the
road in the future, and possibly
make it into a video to show to

The group’s performance on

ing to organize a Jewish
Women’s Center in Squirrel
Hill.

Busis’ portion of the discus-
sion centered on women’s
contributions in the Pittsburgh
area.

“The work women have
done is beautiful. Florence
Reisenstein dedicated her
entire life to race relations. It
is women today who are the
primary caregivers to the

wave of Jewish immigrants
from the Soviet Union,” Busis
said. '

She noted the political posi-
tion Jewish women have held
in the last century.

“Bertha Raul was the first
member of the mayor’s cabi-
net 'and Anne Alpern was one
of the first judges for the city
of Pittsburgh.”

Both guest speakers said
that Jewish women have
always drawn and continue to

draw strength from one
another.

“There is this connected-
ness — just this pull — every-
where you go. Each person
can make a difference,” said
Busis.

The last event of Jewish
Awareness Week will take
place tomorrow at 8 p.m.
in room 252 of the Cathe-
dral of Learning. It is en-
titled “Choosing to be
Jewish.”

The club is also scheduling a

Physical anthropology is a topic
mainly devoted to the study of

“We get to know who every-
body is; we get to interact.” He
also said members in the club
can help each other find out
who are the good and bad pro-

Mackley said they would
like to do more as a club, but
the funding simply is not
enough.

He said, “We have people
interested,” but the club is limit-
ed mostly to local operations,
and those “possibilities will be

Sharif said the club, as

Henderson described the

Ertman encouraged Pitt stu-

“Pitt is a large and impersonal
university. ROTC gives you the
feeling of belonging to a com-

Sophomore Greg Marchand,
an ROTC member, agreed with
Ertman.

“I’ve always seen [ROTC] as a

you need for life. We all work
together for a common cause,
and we form a community,”

things that are difficult to cate-
gorize.

“You have the responsibility
to use [your talents and abilities]
to the betterment of our collec-
tive future. Be informed and
tempered by your humanity and
in the practice of leadership in
our collective future.”

Henderson called for the
audience to always be techni-
cally competent and morally
and ethically sound —— to be a
leader. ’

“Much will and much should
be expected of you in our col-
lective future.” _

To conclude, Henderson

Marchand said.

_ Besides the scholarships,
Ertman pointed out that “many
people use ROTC as an
immediate answer to" the job
market.”

While the scholarships
couldact as an incentive to
join, according to Konitzer,

ambiguous  and that was
the intention. It’s a hostile
law.”

She said the penalties f
or not following these
requirements fall on the
physicians.

Pittsburgh attorney
Patricia Miller said,
“Illegalization never deterred
women one hundred years
ago, and it won’t de-
ter women now.” Miller
said abortion was legal
across the United States until
restrictions began in the
1820s. She said statistics
show that whether legal or
not, about one million abor-
tions still occurred each
year.

“It’s not a function of the
law,” said Miller. “It’s a func-
tion of whether you get
pregnant.” _

Miller also discussed
historical accounts of il-

legal abortions given by
“dairy farmers, motorcyclists,
etc.”

Colker said even if the
procedures are safe, the
“anti-choice forces have
made the process of getting
the service dangerous and
threatening.”

Colker said many pro-life
groups use the time provid-
ed by waiting periods to
abuse confidentiality.

Colker cited one method
used by Operation Rescue,
the nation’s largest anti-
abortion group: painting a
woman’s name on a sign to
hold outside a clinic.

Kolski-Andreaco said she
is not very hopeful for
the ‘90s and predicts more
self-induced abortions,
increasing costs for doctors,
clinics and patients, women
crossing state lines and
unwanted pregnancies car-
ried to term.

Porn world isrﬂtfor /aids

With Bill Clinton claiming to be the president of
youth, his dedication to the younger generation
marked by the Job Corps program going into place and
his many appearances on television shows most fre-
quently watched by younger Americans, one would
assume he would take a strong stand against child
pornography.

However, that assumption would bewrong.

The law currently under fire and being examined
by the Supreme’ Court says that one can be convict-
ed, fined and sentenced if they “knowingly” purchased
or possessed sexually explicit photographs of child-
ren or pornographic films of children under the age of
18. .

However, _it is conceivable that owners of child porno
would claim simply that they did not know the child
was a minor and therefore they could not be found
guilty. «

The problem with the bill is exemplified by The
United States v. X—Cz'temen.t Video in which the owner
of a Los Angeles pornography business, sold an under-
cover agent more than 100 videos featuring a female,
teenage pornographic actress.

The owner had originally declined to mail the films
because he knew he could be prosecuted for dealing
in child pornography, according to The New Yorle
Times. Although the owner was convicted and sen-
tenced to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine, the
conviction was overturned in December, 1992.

Although the case is still being appealed and debat-
ed, the fact it was overturned is a dangerous warningl
If all it takes to avoid a prison sentence is a simple
statement of “I didn’t know how old those kids were,
they looked 18 to me,” the law is essentially useless.
Prosecutors should be able to impose liability without
proof of knowledge that the pornography owner was
aware the actor or actress was a minor. '

The position “marks yet another retreat by
the Clinton Justice Department from the practice of
vigorouslylprosecuting a child pornographer,”
H. Robert Showers, president of The National Law
Center for Children and Families told The New‘ Yorle
Times.

Just as Clinton lobbied and pressured for the passage
of the Job Corps proposal, he should be putting at
least the same, if not more, energy into ensuring chil-
dren are not turned into porn stars before they even

. enter puberty.

It is up to the owner and producer of the porn
videos to seek proof of age from their actors and
actresses. If they do not take the time to check a young
person’s age, they should be prosecuted and punished
for exploiting minors in the world of pornography.

Freedom of expression is one thing, the exploitation
of children is another. '

Political correctness hds gone too far

The Ptttsbzmgh Post-Gazette, our local “bastion of
truth,” ran an article about the FM equivalent of
Rush Limbaugh, our own Jim Quinn. What
unnerved me was the amount of mail that was
generated attacking him and his views. One letter
in particular sent chills down my spine. This letter,
in many more words than this, stated that the
WRRK management should pull his show, or at
least put controls on Quinn’s format and his
views.

His show deals with some interesting topics
such as the “Feministas” and the recent anti-fur
activities of the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. His show has been labeled as racist (the
catch-all retort of the 905), homophobic and anti-

thinkers are now assuming positions in an infor-
mal type of thought police. The idea is that if you
do not agree with them, then you are a NAZI,
HOMOPHOBE or CHAUVINIST.

Well folks, it seems to me that the only ones
employing Nazi-style tactics are the people who
are pushing the new faith of political correctness
by silencing their opponents through the media,
legislation and public scorn. I am here to tell you
that it will not work. We are still going to be here
tomorrow and for a long time to come. We have
just as much right as you do to express our views.

I would like to think that the term “liberal”
would also apply to the manner in which those
who define themselves as such apply the constitu-

feminist. I am writing in defense of
Mr. Quinn’s show not because of
the format that he presents, but

If we can call on one form of self—expression to

This ensures that even unpopular or downright
revolting displays can be and are expressed.

The same people that pushed the envelope of
expression in the 60s, 70s and 805 now would
stomp out any opposing viewpoint in a most
authoritarian manner. Can we let this type of
strong-arm behavior prevail in our society? The
answer is NO! “Political Correctness” has been

Buckley and other conservative voices.Their right
to vent them on their listeners is. If we start to
ignore the First Amendment rights of unpopular
views, who’s to say that all dissenting views could
be treated in the same manner? America, get your
priorities straight and do not lose sight of the
Constitution. It is the framework of our country,
not some rotting piece of parchment collecting
dust. The same applies today as it did 203 years
ago.

Pitt hoc/eey season e

By Tom Schneider
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Hobbled by a broken wheel
and perhaps feeling a little
punch drunk, the Pitt Hockey
Club staggered into the first
round of the WPCHA playoffs
this past Saturday well-armed
with only hopes and perhaps
expectations.

As hard as they fought,
though, it was not enough to
overcome the 2nd—seeded
Carnegie Mellon University
Tartans, who ended the
Panthers’ Cinderella season with
a heartbreaking 3-1 victory.

In a traditionally defensive-
minded game, with the only
quality scoring chances turned
in on the power play, the
Panthers were dead in the water
without Tony T rovato.

Trovato, the leader and light-
ning—quick playmaker on the
Panther power play, was
scratched for Saturday’s game
with a broken wrist he suffered
in Pitt’s regular season finale
against the same CMU squad.

Without Trovato, Panther
coach Harold Ochs was forced
to‘ revamp the power play unit,
and the Panther offensive attack
suffered as Pitt could manage
only 21 shots on goal for the
entire game, despite having sev-
eral five-on-four and five—on-
three advantages.

While the Panther offense
was sputtering all evening long,
the Panther defense was doing
all they could to keep the dan-
gerous Tartan onslaught from
penetrating into the Pitt zone.
For the most part they succeed-
ed, stifling the Tartans near cen-
ter ice much of the time.

to make a successful rush into

the offensive zone, however,

"Nine" Joyce guns Panthers into NCAA tourney contention

Byjack Becker
Staff Writer

The venues where Jenine
Joyce now displays her skills
are half a world away from the
grade school gym she once
played in at St. Bart’s.

But the St. Bart’s inﬂuence on
Joyce, a junior guard on the Pitt
women’s basketball team, is not
so far removed from her game
when she steps on the court at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“You better know a lot before
you get here, or you’re not get-
ting here,” Joyce said. “I had
good coaches along the way.
[Former St. Bart’s coach] Paul
Seneca is a big, big part of why
I’m successful.”

Joyce, who is affectionately
known as “‘nine” by her team-
mates, has rediscovered a once
lost confidence in her play and
is helping to squeeze the Lady
Panthers to a possible NCAA
tournament berth.

Joyce’s numbers have soared
this year, doubling in nearly

"though a guard,

every category. She is _second
on the team in scoring with an
average that has sprung from
four points per game to 11.5.
Her three-point shot is falling 41
percent of the time. She is sec-
ond on the team in assists and,
third in
rebounding with a 4.7 average.

Part of the improvement is
due to Joyce’s upgraded role as
the starting two-guard, and part
of it is due to a re—emergence of
faith in her own abilities.

“Last year I wasn’t shooting
well,” Joyce said. “My confi-
dence was down in general. I
would get in and make bad
decisions. I didn’t play like I
knew how.

“This year I’m playing like I
used to play.”

“This was a year in which
Jenine felt like she could give it
her all,” Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce
said. “I think she feels like we
needed her more. \Ve’ve got a
lot of confidence in her to get
the job done.”

For Joyce, basketball began

“I guess I just started because

it was the thing to do there,”_

Joyce said. “Everybody played.
Coach Seneca didn’t even want
me because he said I was
awful.”

Joyce said that Seneca let her
remain on the team only
because “I wanted to so bad.”

“It made me work harder
because I wasn't as good,”
Joyce said. “[Senecal drilled it
into my head, ‘Don’t give up,
keep working, someday it’ll
come.”’

It didn’t take too long for that
someday to roll around. Joyce
persevered, by being a gym rat
in the winter and toiling on the
asphalt in the summer, and she
improved with age.

However her pursuit of bas-
ketball success did not come
without some detraction. There
were times when Joyce, as a

young girl," needed a little_

nudge.
“I remember my dad would

1'5

always make me go to
Rizenstein [Middle School] to
play,” Joyce said. “I would hate
it, and I would cry. I didn’t want
to go because I’d get cut.”

Yet there are no regrets for
Joyce in her basketball life.
After all, through the game, she
earned herself a scholarship to
Pitt where she is majoring in
business.

In fact, Joyce’s parents have
not had to pay college tuition
for either of their daughters.
Jenine’s sister, Colleen, is cur-
rently averaging 21.1 points per
game in only her second season
at St. Francis College. Last year
Colleen was named Northeast
Conference newcomer of the
year, and this year she leads the
league in scoring.

Apparently basketball runs
through the Joyce family blood-
lines. However, basketball is the
only thing the Joyce sisters
seem to have in common.

Colleen is a self-proclaimed
extrovert, while Jenine leans a
little more to the reserved side.

The two sisters rarely see each
other and have not matched up
on the court in a long time.

So who would win the battle
of the Joyces now?

“I think it would be a good
match-up,” Colleen said. “She
would probably beat me again.
She was always better than me.”

Joyce may not have won any
awards during her first year at
Pitt, but she had already filled
the trophy case by the time she
wound up her high school
career.

At Penn Hills High School,
Joyce didn’t have any problems
with the coaches thinking she
was awful. Joyce played from
the outset and was the first play-
er in Western Pennsylvania his-
tory to start on four WPIAL
championship teams.

“On our team there were a lot
of people from St. Bart’s,” Joyce
said.

Stacked with former St. Bart’s
players, Penn Hills stormed -its

way to the 1990 PIAA champi— A

onship -— Joyce’s senior year.
Joyce averaged 22 points per
game while receiving first team
All-State honors and finished
her career as Penn Hills’ all-time
leading scorer.

“It was great,” Joyce said.
“There’s not much more than
that in high school.”

In Joyce’s rookie season at
Pitt, she did not exactly have
the same instant impact, and in
her second season she sat out
with a medical redshirt. Feeling
that she was far behind her
teammates in development,
Joyce’s confidence lingered
somewhere closer to
Frankstown Avenue than it did
to Forbes Avenue.

That is when Joyce took
another shot in the arm from
_her coach. Bruce named her to
the Big East team that toured
Brazil last summer.

ECAC's last hurrah for low-proﬁle star trackster Blair

Despite a severe lack of exposure, Pitt runner Kim Blair has broken nine school records "in seven different events

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer '

he is a Collegiate All-

American at a respected

university and the proud
owner of several school
records. During the summer
after her rookie campaign, she
represented the United States
on the Junior National Team,
but she is still being overshad-
owed by others on her team.

To the University of
Pittsburgh’s Kim Blair, this is.
just a part of life. For the past
four years, Blair has been over-
looked despite breaking nine
school records in seven differ-
ent events.

“Since we are a non—revenue
women’s sport, we don’t get the
exposure we should as a team.
So the only exposure we do get
is for people who are super-
stars,” Pitt All-American hurdler
Allison Williams said.

“So a lot of our exposure is to
individuals like myself and
Najuma [F1etcher, this year’s
outstanding female field per-
former at the Big East Indoor
Track and Field
Championshipl.”

“The other people that are
outstanding contributors to the
team don’t get the publicity that
they would if the team itself got
all the recognition that it
should.” .

Even though Blair leads a
long list of Panthers who don’t
get recognized, she does not get
disturbed anymore. All the
Hampton, Va. native does is
lookin the record books; then
she is satisfied.

“When you first think about it
you say, ‘Hey, I did all this work

. and nobody knows,” Blair said.

“But as long as I know if any-
body should approach me and
say you didn’t do anything, I
could just look down the
line and say, ‘Look what I
did.”’

What Blair did for the Pitt
women’s track program the” last
three—and—a—half years is a
mouthful.

Occasionally Blair thinks back

to her rookieseason.  '5 

“My freshman year, the team 1
seemed like a fraternity,” Blair
said. “We had so many upper-
classmen. As a freshman, I
didn’t have to worry about any-

thing. That year the upperclass-
men told the freshmen to sit
back and run the best you can.”

During her rookie campaign,
the high school state champion
was one of the top first—year col-
legiate runners in the nation,
earning All—American status as a
member of the Pitt’s outdoor
1,600—meter relay team. In the
indoor season of thatyear, Blair
led the Panthers as they broke
the school_records in the 800-
meter (1.4019) and the 1600-
meter (540.91) relays.

During Blair’s sophomore
year, she did not repeat as an
All-American. Instead, Blair
continued to rewrite Pitt’s
record book. ~

In that year, she broke th
indoor school record in the 200-
meter hurdles with a hot time of
28.40 seconds. Blair managed to
receive All-Big East honors in
the 400-meter hurdlers with a
time of 60.34 seconds.

Last year as a junior, Blair
shattered her time in the 200

meter hurdles with a time of
26.87.

But it was in the outdoor con-
ference championships that
Blair stole the show. She fin-
ished second in the 400 hurdles
(59.05), earning All-Big East
honors in that event for the
third, consecutive year. In the
open 400 meters, she finished
fourth (56.82) and ran on the
1,600-meter relay team that fin-
ished fifth.

But that was just the begin-
ning. A couple of weeks.later,
Blair went to the NCAAs for the
second time in her career. Blair
competed in the mile relay and
the 400-meter hurdles, inlwhich
she holds the school record
with a time of 58.76 seconds.

At the nationals, the mile
relay finished a disappointing
11th place (3:-40.61), but indi-
vidually Blair showed spunk in
the hurdles as she just missed

American.

ness accounting major is contin-
uing where she left off last year.
At last week’s indoor confer-
ence championships, the team
captain did it all, competing in
four different events (55 hur-
dles, 200, 400 and 1,600 relay).

Even though Blair took third
in the 55 hurdles and her 1,600
relay team finished second in
the meet, her display of sports-
manship in the 400 showed just
what she is about.

With 60 meters left to go in
the 400 meters, Blair fell to the
track ending her dream of scor-
ing in that race. Blair had every
excuse to lay on the track, but
she jumped up and finished the
race as blood ﬂowed down her
legs.

Blair said that getting up
proved how much she wanted

9

to win and that she was upset.
The crowd responded by cheer-
ing for her.

“I got upset when people
started clapping because to me
that meant that I shouldn’t have
gotten up,” Blair said.

“It seemed to me that no one
expected me to do anything. To
me, when you are clapping
that means the person is
weak.” ’

Blair isn’t weak at all. Even
though she has always been
overlooked, she is the favorite
this weekend to win the 55-
meter hurdles at ECACs which
might get her some recognition.

“lGetting the attention] does '

not mean anything to her, as
long as [what she does] is good
for the team,” Pitt track coach
Steve Lewis said.

Hockey"-

Continued from page 7
Kirk S. Nevin Arena. Both teams
spent most of the first period
stumbling over each other, try-
ing desperately to get that all-
important first goal of the game.

The Tartans ﬁnally broke the
stalemate with 7:56 remaining in
the first, when CMU center
Roger Maddelena grabbed the
puck behind the Panther net on
a power play, and threw it in
front of Bratkovich to left
winger Phil Beck. Beck deﬂect-
ed the pass under the Panther
netminder giving CMU a 1-0
lead and an important psycho-
logical edge.

For the remainder of the first
period, the Panthers saw several
excellent scoring chances slip
by the boards. Despite having
three different power play
chances in the final seven min-
utes of the opening frame,
including a f1ve—on—three advan-
tage for over two minutes, the
Panthers left the ice at the end
of the first 17 minutes of play
looking up at a 1-0 Tartan
advantage.

The Tartans increased their
lead six minutes into the second
period,‘ when right winger Ray
Ardire stole the puck near his
own blue line, entered the
Panther zone, cut to the right
wing circle and whistled a wrist
shot under Bratkovich to give
CMU a commanding 2-0 lead.

From this point on, the
Panthers ran themselves ragged
trying to stop CMU’s momen-

turn and swing it the other way.
But the zebra factor nulliﬁed the
Panthers’ normal physical play,
and frustration boiled over for
several Panthers.

After forward Ken Anderson
was given a double—minor on a
questionable holding call, cen-
ter iceman and leading scorer
Bill Elliott erupted. His verbal
outburst at the referee earned
him an early shower, and things

were looking grim for the
already undennanned Pitt club.

However, the Panthers used
this sudden turn of events as a
rallying tool and finally broke
through the donut on the score-
board when defenseman Scott
Giordano scored on a slapshot
from the left wing circle with
the Panthers on a two-man
advantage to cut the CMU lead
to 2-1 with just 57 seconds left
in the second frame.

The third and ‘final period
saw both teams. thwarted on
excellent scoring opportunities
by a pair of goaltenders who
looked ' impenetrable. ,
Bratkovich kept the Panthers’
comeback hopes alive for the
entire third period with count-
less acrobatic saves.

The Panthers finally got the

chance they needed to tie the

game with just over two min-
utes remaining, when tliey-got

another power play advantage.

On this day, however, the
Panthers just could not light the
fuse on their powerplay rocket,
and this time, it blew up right in
their faces.

A Panther giveaway at their
own blue line gave CMU cap-
tain Dave Urnland a chance on
a breakaway. Bratkovich
stopped Umland’s first shot, but
could not control the rebound,
and Umland regained the puck

and ﬂipped it over a fallen
Bratkovich to drive a stake
through every heart on the
Panther bench. The goal gave
the Tartans a 3-1 lead and a sec-
ond straight trip to the league
championship against top-seed-
ed West Virginia.

The disappointing 3-1 loss
merely capped off a season in
which Pitt rebounded from a
seventh—place finish last year to
grab third in WPCHA in 1994.
