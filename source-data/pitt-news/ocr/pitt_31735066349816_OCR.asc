Arriving here

this summer, the
“traveling cata-
lysts" of the rally
encountered sev-
eral stumbling
blocks, including
the lack of stu-
dents in the sum-
mer, a very lim-
ited budget to run

 lack of a daily
newspaper, leav-
ing the more ex-
pensive alterna-

In spite of the

7 Of 10 Unions Settle-

Press, Gazette Appear Reddyto

But because of the Nixon ad--.

(Compiled from AP Sources)

The Pittsburgh Press Company
still has plans to publish the two
city dailies this week but the plans
could be just a dream if three un-
ions don’t return to work.

The company said Saturday that
the morning Post-Gazette and the
afternoon Press will be published
tomorrow; the Post-Gazette
would be on the streets tonight-
but it admitted that the teamsters,

\

mailers and paperhandlers have,

not indicated whether they will
return to work or not.

“The company is continuing ne-
gotiations with the teamsters," a
company statement said “and
also with the mailers and the pa-
per handlers who are up for new
contracts."

Both the Press and Post-Gaz-
ette wereshut down May 14 when
some 400 members of the Inter-
national Typographical Union
struck over a contract dispute.

Nearly 1,500 persons were
idled, including most of the Post-
Gazette’s.editorial employees.

The strike was settled last
weekend, but the Press said that
because it still. lacked contracts
with nine other unions, it would
not resume publication until
agreements were reached with all.

_The company said “members
.of the printers union who ended
the strike by ratifying a two-year
. contract, began to return to work
on Sunday.”

Two other unions, the company
said, have promised to return to
work pending final agreements on

 

final contract terms. They are the

stereotypers and engravers.

The Press'said last weekend
that if the printers’ new contract
was used as a modelfor the other
unions which had yet to reach
agreements, the company’s wage
costs could be expected to jump
by the end of 1972 to about $8
million a year.

   

have come up .

newspaper and printers’

a very comprehensive campaign
covering area colleges and high
schools, 200,000 leaflets have
been distributed already, and a
half million will eventually be cir-
culated.

Some of these men have worked
on other registration rallies. in-
cluding ones in Providence, R. I.,
New York. California, North Car-
olina, and Indiana. Future rallies
are being planned for Oregon and
Mississippi.

One of the coordinators of the
rally. Steve Massarsky, brought
up the idea of a new kind of draw-
ing power to rallies and concerts,
and that is the combination “mu-
sic-politics." The linkage of the
two is designed to present a new
awareness of both. Politically ac-
tive musicians such as Peter Yar-
row and John Kaye are bringing
the two into focus. Also rumored
are appearances by Brewer and
Shipley and the Byrds.

Mayor, John Lindsay will be
featured—his first public appear-
ance since his party switch last

month from Republican to Demo-y

crat. . '

Former Democratic Congress-
man Al Lowenstein, veteran of the
Dump President Johnson move-

ment and head of Americans for .

Democratic Action, will speak at
the rally. tomorrow. According to
Lowenstein, “We‘re' going to work

the company said it planned no
immediate increase in the news-
paper's price. It did leave the door
open for a later price hike, how-
ever. -

The fact re-

mains, however.
that this rally
will definitely not have a dump-
Nixon foremat._ The rally is a reg-

istration rally for both Demo-~

crats and Republicans. While the
rally is bipartisan, however, it is
not non-partisan. It is part of an
effort to re-order the priorities of
the country and end the war in
Vietnam.

Howie Pariser, member of the

coordinating’ committee; thinks
"students just have to understand

that the system is responsive."

Both Concilla and Pariser be-

ested in working within the poli-

willing to take at least one more —

chance,” Pariser opines.

THE KATSUR PARKING LOT

. Commuters Get A Break

by MIKE MILLER
Night Editor

The Commuter Association
(CA) is finally untangling the red
tape that has snagged the pro-
gress of new student parking fa-
cilities.

’ Dan McFadden. executive as-

‘sistant Vice Chancellor for Stu-

dent Affairs, has revealed that
410 parking spaces will be avail-
able to students within the next
few weeks and an additional 200
spaces may be -ready by Winter
Term.‘ '

The sites of the new parking fa-
cilities are not included in the
University‘s plans for expansion
in the near future. Therefore,
they provide a more or less per-
manent solution.

A meeting is scheduled for to-
day to work out the details. -

CA President Tom Gainan had
earlier expressed dissatisfaction

THE showing of the film Citi-
zen Kane, originally scheduled
for Tuesday, Sept. 14, at 8
a.m. in Lawrence Hall, has
been changed to Monday,

rence Hall, has been changed

a lot in’ Panther Hollow, and
spaces in the Museum Parking
Lot on S. Craig St.

McFadden explained that the
City Planning Commission reject-
ed plans for the Trees Field lot
on the grounds that it would cause
increased traffic congestion.

A 500-car parking lot is being
built on. the previous site of the
cemetery on Allequippa -St. and
the commuters have been assured
that spaces will be reserved for
their use.

    Parking Relief In Sight

The Panther Hollow lots are in »

progress. but the Katsur Lot was
not expanded as planned.

According to McFadden, _ the
campus bus service will be aug-
mented to provide transportation
to and from Panther Hollow at
peak hours.

Gainan said he was disturbed
by the fact that CA had been sup-
plied with misinformation con-
cerning plans for future lots and
the number of spaces available in
current lots. _ , ’

He said that the original prob-
lem was caused by bureaucratic
bunghng.

“Every department had differ-
ent goals and inter-departmental
communication is poor. The bu-
reaucracy is the real villian,”
Gainan stated. -

Now that the outlook has im-
proved, Gainan is more optimis-
tic about solutions to the parking
problems.

“The situation really looks good
now,” Gainan stated. “It looks
like the Chancellor’s promise will
be fulfilled." ~

News Sense Intact

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Vicariously, most people have

' become aware of how a policeman

or similarly trained civil servant
reacts during a crime or crisis
through newspaper and electron-
ic media accounts. The public has
been presented with an equal
number of “true confessions" by
the miscreant. But what is it like
to be the innocent bystander who
stumbles accidentally into news
and then has to recount what he
saw as part of his civic duty?

The question becomes even
more interesting if the witness
happens to be a former journal-
ist. Can one once trained to re-
main calm, objective, and truthful
able to do so when he is not be-

 paid to cover the incident?

Which emerges, the survival or
the news instinct?

The Pitt News recently had a

 chance to find out when Dennis

 nized the sound of a .38 caliber po-‘
' lice pistol being fired." Alerted,‘

 As he heard the second shot.

Casey, a University employee
with ‘several years experience as
a journalist witnessed a shooting

-between a Pittsburgh policeman

and a former mental patient Wed-
nesday.

Casey was attending a meeting

‘at the Ille Elegba Drug Center,

2027 Centre Ave., where he does
volunteer work when he “recog-

he left the building to seek the
source of distfubance.

Casey threw himself onto the

pavement. He looked at his watch; -

it was 11:05 a.m. Then, watching
the shootout from a distance of
30 feet, he began a slow, methodi-
cal countlof the shots that follow-
ed. From the first to the last shot
he totaled six.

The shootout had occured across

ran to the scene where both men
lay wounded. They, according to
Casey were yelling, “Someone
call an ambulance; someone call
an ambulance.” Casey did.

“It‘s funny," Casey mused lat-
er, “those men are supposed to be
trained in remaining calm during
an emergency, yet there they
were yelling for someone else to
call an ambulance.

Casey also placed a call to one
of the wire services, giving his
account of the incident. Then af-
ter talking with policemen Casey
went home.

Later Casey remarked that his
actions had been “automatic”
from his previous experience as
a reporter. Somehow that helps
to enforce the belief that journal-
ists can be trusted as rational
purveyors of the truth.

But wasn't Casey, a slightly
built man, at least frightened? Or
does the blood of reporters run
cold?

“I guess it just hasn't hit me
yet," Casey said smiling, refer-
ing to the danger he had flirted
with, "but my wife cried that
night when she thought about it."

Casey first trained as a report-
er on the Johnstown Tribune-
Democrat while attending Johns-
town extension of the University.
Then’ while completing his’ degree
in Oakland, he began working at
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

General Studies >ReVa111P‘3d

by BOB GEDEKOH

The School of General Studies
is gaining maturity and stature
through dramatic changes in its
structure, leadership and educa-
tional philosophy. Under the di-
rection of Dean Steele Gow, the
adult evening education programs
are being redesigned to fulfill the
requirements of the students.‘

One of the most innovative steps
taken has been open registration;
no limits are placed on class size
and all interested and competent
students may register for the
course they desire. The size of
the class dictates the facilities
that will be supplied _by the Uni-
versity. A

According to Barry Kline. head
of registration for the School of

‘A General Studies,-"this will allow us

to find out what the students real-
ly want and need. It will no longer
be a matter of the students taking
what the school offers and runing
the risk of being closed out of de-
sired courses, but the~School will
orient its programs to the re-
quirements of the student body.“

Kline reports that approximate-
ly 5,000 students are expected to
register for the evening classes
this fall.

The administration of the CLEP
tests also reflects the changing
attitudes within the General
Studies program. These tests
measure the amount of college
credit that may be grantedto

“Using technical loopholes to create differences among professors
at different institutions of higher education, all of whom essentially
perform similar 10-month services on an annual contract, is irrational
and discrimatory,“ said Richard C. Keller of Millersville State College.
Keller is also vice president of the Association of Pennsylvania State
College and University Faculties for which he spoke.

He claimed that teachers at state-related institutions—Pitt, Penn
State and Temple—have been granted increments. L ’

Association leaders said they earlier asked Governor Shapp to
meet with them to iron. out differences in freeze interpretations.

Keller said faculty members at the state-owned colleges are pro-

Voter registration used to be a
mildly annoying process, but now
it is a sugar—coated pill. And if
enough students take the pill, our
ailing society may partially re-
cuperate, under the leadership of

a new President..

Tomorrow's registration rally, from
4 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Point State Park,
has been organized by dedicated zealots

‘who fortunately have a keen under-

standing of human nature. Their faith
in the average student’s desire to enjoy
himself is as strong as their faith in
student idealism.

With this in mind, the rally's or-
ganizers offer not merely a chance for
involvement, but also a free concert,
a communal experience, and a string of
political speeches that should be more
rousing and less pompous than most.

Seeing the speakers should be a de-
light in itself. Mayor Lindsay is charis-
matic, Congressman Riegle is handsome.
and Al Lowenstein is frothy. Also, May-
or Flaherty will be making one of his
rare, if uninspired, appearances.

Tomorrow’s speakers will be urging
18-21 year olds to exercise their right
to vote to elect politicians committed
to an end to the war in Vietnam and
the reordering of priorities at home.

Most importantly, young people
can have a decisive impact on next
year’s Presidential elections. The 18-
21 year bloc has a potential voting
power of 11.6 million—strong enough
/to turn the tide in 1972.

Thus far, 18-21 year olds have been

registering Democratic in greater pro—’

portions than the rest of the population.
Of those who have registered. 42 per-
cent have chosen the Democratic Party
and 16 percent the Republican Party.
Consequently, youth registration augurs
ill for the Republican Party and its be-
loved leader.

 

e the Pill

 

If young people register and vote.
Richard Nixon can be defeated. our
lingering visit to Vietnam can be end-
ed, and resources can be directed to-
ward the pressing problems of urban
dwellers, particularly members of minor-
ity groups.

Tomorrows rally is not a dump-
Nixon rally. and Republicans. of course.
are welcome to register, as well as
Democrats.

But the impact of the rally and
others like it that have been held in
New York, Minnesota, Indiana, and else-
where will be to pave the way for
Nixon’s defeat next year.

Small wonder that Republican
Governor Edgar Whitcomb of Indiana
cancelled a permit -for a youth regis-
tration rally on the Statehouse Mall
in Indianapolis (on grounds that the
rally might turn violent, with -such in-
flammatory speakers as Bess Myerson
Grant). Whitcomb and other Republi-
cans are scared of student’ registration.
although they cant admit it.

The organizers of tomorrows rally
deserve credit for their perseverance
and hope. Some of them have worked
unsuccessfully within the political sys-
tem for years, but they, have not ‘de-
spaired. '

"My batting record in political
campaigns is 1-7." Howie Pariser. one
of the coordinators. notes ruefully. “But
I still think the system is responsive." /

Surely, it is worth a try.

The war in Vietnam still rages. and
our involvement there has ‘reached the
farcical point as a presidential. "elec-
tion“ with only one contestant draws’
near. The nations cities still seethe
with discontent. And injustices -to
minorities persist.

us quo tomorrow.

A senior beginning his final
year at this university tends to
reflect on the overall quality of
his experience in the academic
community.

The recurring question con-
cerns why the university has not
become one of the nation's ten
or twenty top schools. (A re-
cent survey classifying univer-
sities first through l'ifth rate
classified Pitt as a third-rate
institution.)

Most social scientists concede
that Pittsburgh. as one of the
nations major industrial centers.
provides an environment con-
ducive to the growth of outstand-
ing academic communities. Pitts-
burgh. Chicago. and Palo Alto
are three members of a very
select group of cities in this re-
spect.

Why then is the University of
Pittsburgh not said with the
same respect understood when
saying the University of Chi-
cago or Stanford University?

Carnegie-Mellon seems to be
the only school in the city
which commands that kind of
respect. and it is a younger
institution with a scope of aca-
demic activity not so broad as
Pitts. Status as privately —en-
dowed and the difference in
respect existed then and may
"have been even greater.

The faculty here is good in
most departments and outstand-

:’ .ing in some—anthropology and

philosophy to name two. They

 have proven, themselves both

progressive (many
study options. the ,credit/no
entry -option) and accessible
(creation of office hours and
invitation to dialogue outside
the classroom).

independent

The advising procedures are
generally quite good. The hu-
man element is still in evi-
dence despite growth in size
and numbers. Students at Berke-
ley and Wisconsin. two of the
supposedly more prestigious
large universities. hassle with
a computer to get the courses
they want.

The city _and the university
bring together an almost infinite
variety of elements, and the
opportunities for exposure are
near limitless. Admissions stand-
ards and the quality of the stu-
dent may have some significance,
but that significance is at best
limited in light of the recent
and drastic changes in admis-
sions policy throughout the
academic world.

Still. despite the university's
many attributes. it doesn‘t seem
to this undergraduate that very
'many people leave this institu-
tion with as much healthy ex-
perienee——either academic or
social-—as they might reasonably
have had.

One possible solution to the
problems of quality of the ex-
perience within this academic
community would be the cre-
ation of a greater sense of
community. The relative lack of
any sense of community—either
academic or social—detracts
greatly from the potential qual-

ity of one‘s undergraduate—ex—

perience at Pitt.-

The relative lack of 'a sense
of community is brought about
by four factors. The most ap-
parent deterrent is the make-up
of the student body. At least 50
percent of the undergraduates
commute to school. Any semb-
lance of unity is difficult under
such circumstances.

Two of the factors require a‘

look at proxemics. which in-
volves the study of human be-
ings in relation to space. In the
first place. the actual physical
environment at the university
is not conducive to a sense of
community. The university camp-
us is urban and shared by the
civic center. the medical
center. an_d a business district.
Students dodge cars continually
and spend most of their time on
concrete and asphalt rather
than on grass or earth.

_Moreover. the placement of
buildings on the campus does
more to destroy any sense of
community than to create it.
The university residences-—the
Towers aand quad. the nurses
residence. the fraternity and sor-
rorit_v houses-—are. for all practi-
cal purposes. quite removed from
each other and don't invite inter-
action among the various seg-
ments of . the undergraduate
population. The new Hillside
Dorms will be no exception.

The layout of classroom
buildings further divides the
undergraduate population. The
Cathedral is a hub for students
within the College,’ Benedum
Hall for engineers, and Scaife
Hall those in health-related
fields.;-".5

Pittsburgh: An -Educational Anomaly

The majority of students in
one school have almost no aca-
demic interaction with those in
another, and the concrete and
traffic provide no incentive for
such interaction. The entire
physical environment seems to
breed detachment on the part
of the student.

A final cause involves the
weakening of collegiate insti-
tutions which have traditionally
bound students. Athletics. the
Greek System. and Homecom-
ing are not the cohesive forces
they were on college campus-
es. The reexamination of values
by the young has occasioned,
at least temporarily. a weaken-
ing of these institutions. ‘

The size of the University of

Pittsburgh is a mixed blessing.

It affords the student tremend-
ous opportunities of discovery
and exposure, and draws to the
campus a» number of influ-
ences. It can however, lead to
fragmentation of the undergrad-

‘Tm-I. 1'5

uate population, particularly
when the institution is constrain-
ed physically as Pitt is.

The present physical structure.

and the commuter population
cannot be easily changed. What
must be done is to work within
the boundries in an attempt to
improve the sense of_community,
particularly for the undergradu-
ate.

The attempt made here is to
examine, question, and challenge
rather than to provide simplistic
solutions to complex problems.
This kid does not have the ans-
wers. He does feel that a pri-
mary means toward improving
the quality of education here is
the creation of an atmosphere
in which one can experience
and explore among her or his

 



contemporaries somewhat shield-‘

ed from certain of societys in-
flu_ences.
It gets tough to stand back

and take a look at the world ‘

when one is dodging traffic.

“The old gray mare, she ain't‘ what she used to be, many
long years ago.“ Shed a tear with me. . . . and lament the demise
of the wonder horse.

The fiery horse with the speed of light has vanished from boob
tube programming. leaving only a cloud of dust and ashes of
squelched campfires. Whether the hooved wonder be he or she, gray
or of a differing hue, all appear to have met a similar dim fate.

And what of the cinema‘? The tarnished images flashed across
the silver screen lack the appeal of the fabled steeds of yore. At
any rate, no longer does the cherished cry ring out: “Hi-yo, Silver!”
Today’s mounts are comparative nonentities.

Contemporary cowpokes venture forth astride animals of medi-
ocre anonymity. Who remembers the name of Ben Cartwright's
horse? Or is there no Hoss on Bonanza with a name other than
Dan Blocker‘?

The horses of today are apparently limited to such unimagina-
tive monnikers as “Whoa,” “Giddyup," “Boy,” and “Fella"-—with
perhaps an occasional “Girl." A far cry from the echoes of "Get-
tum up, Scout," and the fondly recalled Trigger, Topper, and

‘ﬁﬁhampionl

A few even starred in their own series. Remember My Friend

-Flicka and Fury? The name of each legendary steed will be for-

ever hallowed in the halls of trivia.

But, what’s in a name, you may ask———a-las, modern nondescript _

nags differ from their predecessors in more than name only. The
noble steeds of yesteryear were capable of outstanding displays.of
skill and intelligence far surpassing the lack of horse sense evi-
denced by contemporary nags.

The legendary miracle horses often leaped across gaping
chasms; m0st_of today’s mounts would undoubtedly perish in the
attempt, if not shy away at the possibility.

The super steeds of days gone by could untie the ropes by
which their _masters were bound, could bring aid to the place
where their injured owner lay, and even defend themselves against
theft. Who could forget the sight of Fury rearing up on hind legs,
flailing angrily against the sky (and perhaps the attacker), fiercely
snorting and whinnyiiig a warning? Ah, those were the days! I
I remember seeing Gene Autry‘ with Champion" at South
kneel down for prayers, as well as performing the usual process of
solving problems in arithmetic. Champion demonstrated a degree of
intelligence that was probably above the level of most of the audi-

. CIICB.

And _then we have the outspoken Mister Ed. He and his owner.

_Wilbur, used to engage in conversation. You can bet that if this

palamino had gone unnamed, there would have been some talk!
But time can take a truly horrendous toll’. Is that Mister Ed we

.1 . . . . ,
Eawiagsee, reduced to acting in commercials for Hunts snack pack? Or

is this some cheap impersonator, trying to cash in on the beloved
Ed’s popularity? Shocking, indeed!

‘ ‘Even in recent films, the old trends have fallen into disuse.
Remember ‘Tom Mix and Tony? Probably not. How about Na-
tional Velvet? A host of others existed in those days- The famous
‘Italian Westerns, however, feature drab horses that go unknown-
and this has become the rule, rather than an exception. '

The untalented steeds of today are better fit for the glue fac-
.t0ry, orat ‘best a job on a carousel. These mangy mounts are not

 . \» uncommonly disposed of with a bullet through the brain. It is fit-
if‘-— ting and proper.

 

Where have all the horsestars gone? Perhaps the aged graze
in _some earthly Elysian Fields, contentedly munching until the ap-
proach of the Grim Reaper. Yet the enfeebled wonder horse gains
no respite in death, nor may such a mount fade away. Ask Roy
Rogers’ taxidermist. And have a second thought the next time you
open a can of dog food. It may contain the stuff of which memor-
ies were made.

In eight months my sojourn
as a university student will end
and I will be somewhere ignor-
ing the promises of security as
an executive secretary.

It is difficult for me to swal-
low the fact that someone else
will be considered more fit for a
position because his name is Al-
fred, and discouraging to antici-
pate a salary equal to that of a
male with an eighth grade edu-
cation.

If I chained myself to some-
0ne‘s kitchen stove I could pro-
bably avoid the
this “mans world."

But I’m sure that the thought

of supporting two is as unnerv-j

ing to most men as the thought
of laundry rituals and vacuum
cleaners is to me.

It is unfair that men are ex-
pected to support women, act
as arbiter in family feuds, and
display an instinctual knowledge
of mechanics. And it is even

more unfair that women are ex-_
pected to choose between a ca-

reer and 15 to 20 years of baby-
sitting.

Perhaps when our ancestors
were nomads it was more feas-

struggles of

A Liberation

ible for women to tend the tents
while the men herded sheep. His-
tory is already written and- it
seems foolish, if not impossible,
to discard or rewrite every volume.

But today there is no reason
why every gwoman should be
considered just a little less of
a person than every man and
there is no logic behind,the no-
tion that anyone is less fit for
a role because of her sex.

“Just wait until winter," a
male neighbor told me. “When
_one of those ladies asks me to
shovel her driveway I‘ll say——
honey you want to be liberated,
then you shovel.“

Don‘t these meatheads realize
that we're in this for them too?
That with equality for sexes we
can do away with surgery for
the Christine Jorgensens of the
system, and _with males who
bend ‘the psychiatrists‘_ears to
babblings about their inability
to fulfill the independent, ag-
gressive role that’s expected of
them‘?

Feminism‘ does not only. mean
liberation for women, but liber-
ation for every member of the
species. We should congratulate

aspirations of a male nurse.

After a speech by Gloria Stein-
em last summer, an aged woman
turned to me and said, “Honey,
we were saying the same
things when Ilwas your age and
look where women are today."

I balked and tried to ignore
her pessimism. But-there is a

‘chance that we won’t acquiesce

as we did after the passage of
the 19th amendment. The goals
of feminism should come as a
welcome relief to women and
men alike. ’

Women are lambasting the
system from both political and
social angles. The movement is‘
factionalized and at first glance
it seems that feminists disagree
on both the means and ends of
liberation. In some segments
even the thought of including
men in the revolution is dubbed
“suicidal."

I,-for one, feel that the battle

of the sexes should end. It is
time for women and men to re-
alize each individual’s personal‘
worth and the ways in which
archaic traditions are oppressing
us all.

Because if the movement.
fails this time it won't represent
a defeat for women, but a defeat
for each human being.

At Off-Campus Housing Office -

Students Fight  Bad

by DENNIS KLEPPICK

This past summer. a student
committee on Off-Campus Hous-
ing was allocated office space in
the Student Government offices.
located in the Student Union build-
ing. The“ Off-Campus Housing
Committee, according to Frank
one of its co-chairmen.
was formed “to protect students
from landlords who take unfair
advantage of the lack of housing

1 space. charge too much. and ig-



nore hazardous or unsanitary con-
ditions in their apartments.”

Little said the committee stem-
med from student concern of be-
ing “victimized by paying exhor-
bitant rates for places that were
below Health Department stan-
dardsf' a

Little cited the recent death of
a student in a fire in apartments
located on McKee and Bates Sts.
in Oakland as one example.

The Off—Campus Housing Com-
mittee offers a variety of serv-

8 ices to students. all free of charge.

'53-?‘

One of the services of the com-
mittee is to investigate false or
misleading advertising by realty
companies. “One local company
ran an ad concerning ‘student and
parent approved’ housing. There
is no such thing as a stamp of ap-
proval from the University or the

Housing office,” said Little.

V -In this area, the committee will
respond to any complaint or ques-
tions from the students.

The committee has a lawyer on
retainer to answer any legal ques-
tions. especially those on leases
and security deposits.

“According to state law, depos-
its must be returned within 30,
days of termination unless a list.
ofispecific damages is forwarded
to the tenant,” said Littile. “Land-
lords have occassionally taken
over six months to return depos-
its or have charged unreasonable
fees for repairing damage.”

, Little added that “few students _
know that they can sue for an-
amount double the deposit if the

deposit isn‘t returned or a list
of damages presented.“

“Our lawyer has often been
able to negotiate prompt returns
or a fair assessment of_damages.
The fact that an attorney calls
makes them (landlords) have sec-
ond thoughts." said Little.

RENT WITHHOLDING

The committee has been in con-
tact with the Allegheny County
Health Department. "The Health
Department." said Little. "wel-
comes calls or questions by stu-
dents and has promised to investi-
gate complaints promptly.“

“The Health Department
awards points for violations if a
particular apartment receives 20
points then the tenant can with-
hold rent from the landlord by
paying the rent to a third party
designated by the Health Depart-
ment.”

The.landlord then has a speci-
fied time to repair the violations.
Little indicated that a portion of
the rent would be returned to the
tenant if the‘ repairs were not
completed in that time.

The committee has started a

MODEL LEASE

Another proposal under consi-
deration is a model lease that
would be fair to both landlord and
tenant alike. “Such a lease would
contain three clauses usually lack-
‘rig in the leases used by area
landlords." said Little.

“One clause would concern it-
self with deposits, including a
written list of damages already in
the apartment before the tenant
moved in. Another clause would
specify under what terms a ten-
ant could sublet and who would
pay the security deposit while the
new tenant resided in the apart-
ment.

“The last clause would be a list
of written special agreements be-.
tween the landlord and tenant con-
cerning items like pets. repairs a
landlord promised to undertake.
and so on."

   
   
  
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
     
  
    
  
 
 

Little added some advice ('0
-cerning the new ‘wage-pr
freeze: “I'd like to‘em_phas1ze
that the wage-price freeze appli.
to rents, even if the 1e.as‘e.was
signed before the freezegwasban
nounced. Tenants don’t have ,
pay any increases until the freeze

is over.

Little concluded, “The bigges
thing ‘we need, now that we ha-"

Department training ‘plan.---‘goes

0 Special Task F olrce
Views Student Affairs

—Functions existing outside
the Office of Student Affairs
that should be performed by a
central student services organi-
zation.

—New functions that might be
added to the central student
services organization. Caution
was expressed that no new func-
tions should be added that
would cause a budgetary dislo-
cation.

The Task Force is also con-
sidering ways to improve ser-
vices to commuters, foreign and

graduate students, and other
special groups that are now
largely neglected.

According to a memorandum
by Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
"The present reorganization and
change of senior personnel pre-
sents a unique opportunity at
this time to make this investiga-
tion. The present administrative
structure for Student Affairs
has existed in its general frame-
work since the time when Pitt
was far less large and complex
as it is today."

Edison Montgomery, acting
Vice-Chancellor_ of Planning
and Budget of the Special Task
Force on Student Affairs, feels
the study will be completed

sometime around the end of-

October.

Energy Studies Proposed

The University has joined five
other universities in the United
States and.Canada in the pro-
posed construction of a $13
million Upper Atmosphere Ob-
servatory to study the effects
of the high altitude energy on
weather, radio communica-
tions and other phenoma on
earth.

The universities, organized
as the Upper Atmosphere Re-
search Corporation (UARC).
are the University of Illinois
at Urban-Champaign, Rice Uni-
versity, Penn State. Massachu-
setts Institute of Western On-
tario, and Pitt.

Pitt is represented in the
UARC by two trustees: Dr.
Thomas ‘M. Donahue, profes-

sor of physics and director of
the University’s Space Research
and Coordination Center, and
Paul Solyan, Comptroller and
assistant treasurer at Pitt. Sol-
yan _will also be treasurer of
the UARC.

The tenative site of the ob-
servatory is near the central
or eastern U.S.-Canadian bor-
der where, because of the
earth's magnetic field, ionized
layers of the upper atmosphere
form a low-density "trough"
offering opportunity for a vari-
ety of research capabilities not
possible elsewhere.

The Upper Atmosphere Ob-
servatory will study pheno-
mena such as electric fields.

winds. and the ionosphere at
heights of 50 to 6.000 miles
above earth and the relations
of these on the atmosphere
below and space above.

The estimated cost of $13
million may be cut by $1 mil-
lion if existing transmitters can
be utilized by moving them to
the new project. The cost es-.
timate, however. does not in-
clude site acquisition.

If the site is selected this fall,
design can get underway and
site development may be com-
pleted by 1972. Laboratory con-
struction is scheduled for 1973,
with completion in 1974, _and
the operation and experiments"
will begin in 1975. Operation
costs are estimated at $1.4

milliona year.

Support and use of the obser-
vatory ‘is planned to be inter-
national. with a strong research
and _educational program in-
volving resident and visiting
scientists and graduate stu-
dents. '

Pitt Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar stated. during a press
conference held August 31 to
announce the plans for the
UARC's Upper Atmosphere
Observatory, that the selection
of Pitt as one of the founding
universities of UARC is a
recognition of the outstanding
place the University has achieved
in space-related research .since
the founding of the Space Re-
search and Coordination Center
in 1963.

Freezing Toes Nails

Colds, Scientists Claim

WASHINGTON (AP)—Development of a ‘cure for nose colds-by
chilling the big toes with a refrigerant chemical was claimed Thurs-

day by two researchers from Israel.

The researchers even said the technique apparently provides
indefinite immunity against such runny—nose maladies, according to
preliminary findings among 100 patients treated during the past

year.

But some American scientists snorted at the idea.

The Israelis reported the idea is this:

Sudden temporary chilling of the big toes almost immediately
brings about a lowering of the normal body temperature with the

toe because, they said, the big
toes and the nose are nervous
system ”reflectors” of one an-
other in their response to exter-
nal stress. And this nasal tem-
perature-lowering‘ along with
humidity “dries up the nostrils,”
thereby “curing” the cold, they
said.

They indicated the concept
is based partially on the ancient
Chinese method of acupuncture-
sticking needles in one part of
the body to attack an ailment
else-where.

But two American medical
specialists on the common
cold, asked by a newsman’ to
evaluate the report, said that:

,Ec,,,,.c°“,,,. (( ;) While the toe-chilling tech-

nique might conceivably, abort

, they seriously doubt it could

' due to viruses.

, _ And the Americans generally

- ‘ pooh—poohed the suggestion that

the technique could provide long-

‘ time immunity, even against al-

lergic type colds.

‘Soul To Soul:’
A Musical Misfit

by RON LOZOWSKI

"This is where it all came from." wails the inimitable Tina

' Turner—and Soul To Soul. current feature at the Stanley. desperately

tries not to permit the audience to forget the fact.

The opening frames record Tina belting out the title tune. in
what is perhaps the high point of the film. No sooner has she com-
pleted the number . . . when the viewer is whisked aboard a plane
nearing the shores of Ghana.

Soul To Soul is a semi-documentary of a collection of Ameri-
can soul artists touring Ghana. Frequent attempts to contrast the two
societies and their musical forms succeed only in wrackmg the
nerves.

The cinematography rarely advances beyond the point of un-
imaginative mediocrity. Foisted upon us are such dusty cliches as a
shift from a funeral to a wedding that is so trite as to necessitate
the supression of a groan. '

The music, too, is below par. ..n apparent misfit, Santana. pro-
vides a repetitive, yawn—inducing instrumental worth mention only
because it serves as the lead-in for a somewhat less droning vocal-
"Black Magic Woman.“

Even more disgusting are the facial contortions of the group’s
lead guitarist. I-found myself on the verge of heading for the exit;
and this “set” is probably the longest in the film, with the possible

, exception of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.

The Revue features an incredibly tight back—up band, while Ike

is revealed as a versatile and talented artist lacking Santana’s phony

flash. Tina wades through such souldies as “Oo Poo Pah D00" and
"River Deep, Mountain High" with a dynamic intensity that should
have characterized the entire film.

Yet even this opportunity to salvage the project is wasted.
Through most of the sequence, Tina is filmed from the neck up. thus
denying the viewer the frenetic visual aspect of Tina's act that
makes it such a mind-rending experience.

While Roberta Flack‘ proves herself a sensitive vocalist, and
Wilson__Pickett shines briefly, the other artists (Les McCann, Staple
Singers,’ Willie Bobo, Voices of ‘East Harlem) merely go through
the motions—-which isn’t quite enough to rescue the film.

Soul To Soul purports to get down to the nitty gritty, but instead
remains mired in the grit and the grime.

EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR
The Moody Blues (THS 5)

The Moody Blues is a rock group different from
any other. Among the five of them, they play 20
or 30—some instruments. Their vocals. complete
with precise voice training. are good. and har-
monies" are used well. Studio mixing is always done
to perfection. And the group has been around for a
long. long time.

The Moodies have both classical and philosophi-
cal leanings. In earlier albums, they often ponder-
ed life andeternity in songs that dripped with vio-
lins, melotrons, and harps in addition to regular
rock instruments. They played everything them-
selves; no session men were used, even the music
sounded like a full orchestra. -

With their talents as songwriters and musicians
being so vast, one expects a lot from the Moody
Blues. This group is capable of producing an ulti-
mate album . . . one in which every song is memor-
able, all instrumentation is perfect, and the theme
of the record is profound. None of the previous al-
bums have reached this goal; all were merely good
to excellent.

The latest Moody Blues release, Every Good Boy
Deserves Favour, is also a near miss from a perfect
collection. In many aspects. it shows an improve-
ment over earlier ones, and it far surpasses one
rather disappointingdisc, A Question of Balance.

Gone from‘ this one. and not missed, are the
dramatic readings at the beginning and end of the
album. There are no cold—hearted orbs ruling the
night, no men learning compassion, nothing bursting
forth with the power of ten billion butterfly sneezes.

i Every Good Boy Deserves Favour contains
some of the best songs ever done by the group. Most

i'Vl’edn'esday, ‘segregate. 8, 1971 .'r1”1EPITTlNEwse;I>agéi9’

notable are “The Story in Your Eyes,” “Our Guess-I A
ing Game,” and “One More Time to Live.” Produc-‘ ,

tion and instrumentation are up to standard, and
flute work in this album isespecially outstanding.

The release has its faults, however. In spots, it
is unabashedly pretentious, as in "My Song.“ And
the lyrics are not of consistent quality, although the
music itself obscurs this flaw. ‘

By far the worst part of the album is the open-
ing sequence, entitled “Procession." It sounds like
a group of five or six mistakes spliced together.

There’s a short dull passage with a synthesizer,
a short dull passage with a sitar, a short dull pass-
age with African-like chants to the beat of a tom-
tom, and, worst of all, the Moody Blues all yelling
“Desolation!” in the middle of a quiet spot. Ugh!

But if one bears with this opening, he finds him-

self drifting into the best song on the album, "The A I

Story in Your Eyes.“ Written by Justin Hayward. it
is catchy, driving rock with a fine melody and even
finer instrumentation. the mark of the Moodies‘
classical influence. The song is followed by Ray,
Thomas” “Our Guessing Game," another excellent
tune.

-All told. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour is

well worth the purchase. Except for the first cut,‘ i  R

the album is enjoyable, even if the listener is not in
the contemplative mood that best suits other Moody

‘ Blues albums. —

7 Still, there are two questions this reviewer can't
shake: will the Moody Blues ever release the per-

' fect album of which they are capable? And will they

ever perform in Pittsburgh? If the answer to either
question is "yes." rock fans here have a lot to look
forward to.

Texas Regents, Paper Battle

by LORETTA HORRELL

The recent termination of a 50-
year old student newspaper char-
ter resulted in a showdown be-
tween student journalists and the
Board of Regents at the Universi-
ty of Texas in Austin.

The conflict arose between the
Regents and the Texan Student
Publication. Inc. (TSP) in July.
Under the charter commissioned
to TSP 50 years ago the student
group was to function as a pri-
vate, non-profit organization .. .m-
der the stipulations set in the
charter by the Board of Regents.
One stipulation said that neither
party, the TSP or the Regents,
could act alone -in any matter in-
volving student publications.

TSP. acting without the ap-
proval of the Regents. asked for
and received a seven month ex-
tension on the charter from Tex-
as Secretary of State Martin Dies.
Dies extended the charter to per-
mit the publication of the Univer-
sity's newspaper. The Daily Tex-
an, while the two parties work-
ed out the problem.

As a result of Diels action, the
Board of Regents, having voted
unanimously not to uphold Dies
extension. are taking TSP to court
Sept. 20. Lady Bird-Johnson, one
of the nine Board members,
though voting to ignore Dies’ de-
cision, was said to be sympathe-
tic to the TSP.

the Regents‘ actions, is now op-

erating at a loss of $75000 be-
cause the Regents rescinded the
funds the Texan had been receiv-
ing from student activities fees.

The Texan receives two-thirds
of its income from advertising
and less than a third from sub-
scriptions, some of which are
bought by the University for foot-
ball advertising. Previous to the
Regents’ abrogation of the activ-
ities fee, the Texan had received
$4.10 of every activities ticket
sold.

Lori Rodriguez, editor-in-chief
of the Daily Texan, narrowed the
TSP’s problem with the Regents.
She stated that the TSP would not
accept the new charter outlined by
the Regents because the Regents
had added several new clauses
that the TSP would not approve.
The two major areas of conflict
were a “dissolution clause” and
the establishment of an interim
committee.

Rodriguez explained that the
Regents had planned to add a
clause to the new charter limiting
the power of the’Daily Texan’s
Board of Directors, which is the

' governing body of the newspaper.

‘ ’///’//,,;<'/. l .

/

She and L. L. Edmonds, general
manager of the Daily Texan, feel
that the “dissolution clause” will
“open the door for censorship."

The second problem outlined
by the Texan’s editor was the es-
tablishment of D an interim com-
mittee made up of faculty mem-
bers and students to act as a med-
iator for the Regents. TSP argues
that the committee is not needed.

The resignation of seven uni-
versity professors is also attribu-
ted to the Regents‘ actions.

., :iDePasqua came to Pitt in 1969, too late to recruit and
emersed in the administrative chaos that collapses around
27» losses in three seasons. He brought Pitt back to respecta-
bility; even prestige. He gave his team and its school some-
thing that had been lost, pride. They had something to be-
_;ieve in again. The support of the student body was a re-
freshing bonus which is very much appreciated by the team
and its coach. -

But DePasqua is still aware of where he stands. He
hasn’t really produced a winner yet and considering his op-
ponents this year, he’d be hard-pressed to predict one for

beyond the win-loss column. The situation surrounding
the season becomes little more than circumstantial evidence,
especially to the people who do the hiring and firing.

last season running backs-Lou

Julian and John Moss get their
chance to anchor the Panther
running attack this fall.

Last year, Moss had only 22
chances to run the ball, while
Julian carried only once. How-
ever. Moss was used as a block-
er in many games, and Julian
saw action at linebacker.

In training camp and recent
practice sessions,’Julian has
been running from the fullback
slot with the first team. Due

’ to a leg injury. suffered in the

first practice at camp, Moss has
been unable to run much. Three
sophomore backs, Clair Wilson,
Stan Ostrowski, and Bill Englert
have filled in at the halfback
position during the pre-season

workouts.

Both runners are anxious to
play this season and arehappy
with the triple option attack that

. the Panthers willuse this year.

At first I didn‘t like it, but
now I do," said Julian. “You
have to veer in and out-there
is no set pattern and you—don’t
just have to run to a hole."

“I definitely like it,” com-
mented Moss with a smile.

Moss, who is just getting over
the bad muscle pull which side-
lined him for camp, is confident
that he’ll be ready for this Satur-
day’s opener against UCLA.

“The doctors said I could play
in last‘ Saturday's _scrimmage,

.but the coaches wanted me to

sit out,” he continued. “I feel
that my timing is down and that
I can play.“ '

Julian is in good spirits-as
the campaign is ready to~com-
mence. _ ' '

“This is the best that I have
felt since I’ve been at Pitt,” he
said. “It’s the first time that I
don’t have to worry abouta leg
injury. My timing and hitting
have been good so far.”

Neither runner feels any
added pressure now that they’ll
be counted on.

“There’s no pressure now,“
relates Julian, "not until the
season starts. The competition
from the sophomores makes me
work a little harder, but I try
not to look back.”

Moss echoes Julian’s senti-
ments. “I try not to get too up‘-
tight about it-two weeks ago
I didn't even think that I
would be able to play, but the
doctors did a great job on me.” '

The two backs feel that their
experience together in thegpast
years will be beneficial to their
backfield play. A '

“Lou has pretty good size and
it’s nice to have someone big
to block for you," complement-
ed Moss. \

Julianfeels that this year's‘

. team doesn’t have as much depth

as last year, but is “more spirit-
ed, more hustling, and a closer
knit group. "

Moss has added incentive in
many of the games this year.

“I’ll be playing against a lot
of friends this year-Walt Patul-
ski from Notre Dame, Joe Ehr-
mann from Syracuse, and a lot
of guys from Navy.”

Both backs ‘ agree that this
year’s schedule is going to be
very rough. “We 'don‘t« have a.

Booters  
    Blues

by STEVE ZYCH
Is there dissention on the soccer team?
Is that the same team that finished with an 8-4 record last
year (its best in five years) and narrowly missed making the
nationals by a single goal?

Yes it is. But it’s also the same team that witnessed one of
its leading players walking off the field cursing at Coach Leo
Bemis like a little brat because he didn’t like the position he was

asked to play in scrimmage. This is also the team that three ’

years ago saw over half a dozen players quit the team for rea-

sons ranging from personality clashes to differences of opinion

on the mode of play. -

Since I’ve been associated with the team for three years
I’ve only seen this “disease” (as Coach Bemis refers to it) grow
worse while the team’s talents and recordimprove, mostly be-
cause of excellent recruiting by Coach Bemis. Yet I can’t help
feel that if there had been better harmony last year,.the team
would have made the playoffs.

It has always been a minority which is_ at fault but as" anyone

V who. has ever played on a‘team knows—it only takes one dis-

gruntled player to destroy that tenuous balance that is known
as teamwork.

Soccer Coach Leo Bemis, a veteran of over two decades of
successful soccer coaching at Pitt, is aware of the malady.

“This is a disease typical of soccer players.,Sure some of

them don’t want to listen but this ‘phenomenon‘ isn’t restricted

to soccer players. Soccer is especially liable to the“ disease be-
cause it is a sport that stresses individuality and is usually a
strange mixture of foreign and native players,” says Bemis.

The team has players from all over the globe as well as ones
from several of the eastern states. Yet the friction on the team
between these varied and often volatile individuals is _surpris-
ingly minimal. Then where does the rub lie?

It lies between the players and the coach.

The problem is that a few individuals feel that they know-

more about the sport than the coach. Some have had the guts to
express this openly (and not always in a pleasant manner) but
most have preferred to remain anonymous. Yet these individ-
uals do more harm to the team by beefing behind Bemis’ back
than do the popoffs, whether they realize it or not.

The usual rationale for their beefs is that “Bemis doesn’t
know what he’s doing—he never played varsity soccer!” The

/ trouble with this excuse is that while Leo may never have play-

ed college soccer he certainly has learned a lot about the game.
In fact he was one of only eight coaches certified by Dietmar
Kramer, one of the”best coaches in America, at a special coach-
es clinic held in early August in Colorado.

Thus I feel that vtheplayers gripes about Bemis’ lack of
knowledge are completely unfounded and unwarranted.

Let’s face it, the team has enough problems without need-
lessly compounding them. There is a very tough schedule, the
loss of some key players and possibly more, but there is also
more talent than ever before.

As Coach Bemis succintly summed it up in his overview of
the upcoming season: “If I can pick the right men, and we can
work out our internal problems, and everybody’ agrees with the
fact that soccer is a team sport—then we can have a winning
team."

Right on, Coach! I ' *

Kruth -Snares Another
Semester’s Eligibility

   
  

 

Who else but Jerry Kruth could
pull off something like getting an-

having already spent three years
at Pitt after transferring here
from Slippery Rock — where he
also played‘?

Kruth, a fullback (defense). was
given another semester of eligibil-
ity because he proved to the athle-
tic directors of the Big Four (Pitt,
Penn State. West Virginia. and
Syracuse) that he changed to Pitt

, for “academic" reasons rather
Jerry

than soccer. But then,
Kruth is the type of individual who
has always been known to pull off
the unlikely or the unusual.

In a game last year Jerry got
_ trapped upfield on one of his dar-
ing rushes. The other team inter-
cepted and fed the ball to a lone
fullback who sped towards the

Pitt goal on a breakaway. Just as’

the forward began to pull back his
leg for a sure shot at a goal. out
of nowhere someone swiftly and
surely plucked the ball away from
the frustrated forward. Who was
the player who saved the game
that day—-who else but Jerry
Kruth‘?

Kruth is optimistic about this
year’s talented team, “The team
looks fantastic. For the first time
I’ve been here the‘ team has gen-
uine enthusiasm, spirit, unity and,
most importantly, respect for
Coach Leo Bemis.”

Lack of respect for their coach
and each other have been the
team's biggest debits in the past.

Kruth, however. likemost play-
ers feels that this year will be
different. "The guys have faith in
"Coach Bemis as well as each other
this year. We‘re not repeating the
mistakes of the past."

Jerry is also pleased with the
new attitude of John White, the
Peck’s bad boy of the team in the
past. “John’s one of the most en-
thusiastic players on the team. He
really wants to play this year.
John and Gus (Theofilos) have
really decided to settle down and
play soccer this year and that’s

- good as they mean a lot to this

team.”

The fast fullback also points out
-that there is no longer any split
between the American and foreign
players. He feels the reason is
that “thevguys have had a chance
to play together now and as a re-
sult have adusted to each other’s
styles of play."

Among the other reasons cited
by Jerry for the team's apparent
unity this year are the better play-
ing facilities, more quality play-
ers and most importantly Coach
Bemis himself.

“When I first came here we
played and practiced at Kennard
Field which is far from campus

however, quickly closed the door
on Chicago by coming back in the
seventh with two runs and adding
two more in the-eighth.

Going five complete innings,
the winning pitcher for the Pi-

  Leahy, Hanratty Fight

For 2nd QB Spot;
Bradshaw Is No. 1

PITTSBURGH (AP)— Terry Bradshaw is the number one quarter

back for the Pittsburgh Steelers but who is number two?

Bradshaw had his finest day in pro football Saturday night, firing
four touchdown passes as the Steelers ripped the New York Jets, 35-21,

in Cleveland.

“I‘d have to say it was his finest performance,” Coach Chuck Noll
said Sunday in a phone interview. “And he had no interceptions. That’s

a big thing." A

Bob Leahy, third string quar-
terback at the start of fall train-
ing camp, played the fourth quar-
ter against the Jets and com-
pleted six of 12 passes for 60
yards and led the Steelers on a 74-
yard touchdown drive in 17 plays.

Terry’ Hanratty, the third-year
pro from Notre Dame, saw no ac-
tion, leading to speculation that
the Butler, Pa., native could be
trade bait before too long.

“We have to make a decision
there," said Noll. “We looked at
Hanratty last week and Leahy
this week.”

“They’re saving me for the
Rams,” Hanratty said, referring
to the Steelers last game of the
season with Los Angelas. Hanrat-
ty and Bradshaw were supposedly
in a race for the quarterback job
at the start of the pre-season, but
Hanratty admits his work is not
cut out for him.

“There’s a great chance there,”
he said when asked if he could be
on the trading block. “You always
think about those things.

“But it doesn’t bother me. -You
can’t let it bother you. If you start
letting it do that, then you give in
to the pressure and you don't do
as well.

“ ’Xnyway,.I‘m too ydung to wor-
ry,” he said.

Against Minnesota last week,
Hanratty played the second half
and completed only one of eight
passes for four yards and had one
intercepted.

Bradshaw gave the Steelers 21
points in a big second quarter
against the Jets. He hit Ron
Shanklin on scoring passes of 32
and 46 yards and then found Jon
Staggers from four yards.

Inithe third quarter, running
back John Fuqua took a screen
pass from the blond Louisiana
Teach graduate and raced 30
yards for a touchdown. -

The Jets, using third-string”

quarterback Bob Davis in place of
injured Joe Namath and Al Wood-
all, didn’t get beyond the Steelers
45-yard line in the first half._

But Davis, finding leaks in the
Steelers secondary,fired a sec-
ond half touchdown to Dick Cas-
ter and two to wide receiver Ed
Bell.

The Steelers got their final
score in the fourth quarter when
Fuqua sliced over from the one on
the drive lead by Leahy.

 

 

 
 
   

    
   
  
 
 
    
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
   
   
   
   
   
    
    
    
   
   
 
   
   
  
 
   
   
   
  
 

   

  

WHAT IS THE UNIVERSITY OF
PITTSBURGH ROAD RACING TEAM?

It is Pitt's new, exciting co-ed team
that has its own professionally prepared
race car, has been competing at the most
famous road racing courses in America, and
to the astonishment of the crowds, has
been winning! The surprising successes of
students against professionals have received
extensive national publicity, and the possi-
bility ofa new national collegiate sport may
be on the horizon. A

WHAT CAN THE UNIVERSITY OF
PITTSBURGH ROAD RACING TEAM
DO FOR ITS MEMBERS?

Aside from being one of the ’'players’’
on one of the most talked about organiza-
tions in racing today, the team will allow
you and your friends to spend weekends at
places like Watkins Glen, New York . . .
Atlanta, Georgia . . . Daytona Beach, Flori-
da and Indianapolis Raceway Park. These
picturesque resort areas permit students to
additionally enjoyswimming, boating and
an out-of-site nightlife. Membership benefits
usually include free transportation from
school to the track and back, low cost
modern housing at the college nearest each
track, and a future likelihood of a major
reduction in admission to the track.

Other advantages include the limitless
possibilities of developing your own new
ideas and seeing them take shape and the

deep sense of accomplishment you experi-

ence with the knowledge that you are an

amateur successfully competing with the
best professionals. Such benefits naturally
depend on the sensitivity of the infividual
and the extent of his or her involvement.

- /

HOW MUCH OF MY TIME WILL IT TAKE?

As much as you want to give. Member-
ship alone entitles you to attend every race,
at least as a spectator. However, to qualify
as a member of the ”Pitt” crew, or the
public relations staff or other branches of
the team dealing with photography, book-
keeping or administration, will definitely re-
quire as much time as any varsity sport on
campus.

In order to place the road racing team
in a proper perspective, it might be best to
remember that the team participates in an
extremely serious sport that involves ele-
ments of life and death. Its members
strenuously function in an arena with pro
fessionals and against odds that are over-
whelming. Accordingly, you will find the
determination of its active members rather
substantial.

WHAT ARE THE MEMBERSHIP
REQUIREMENTS?

There aren't any, as long as you're
only interested in bringing your date along
to the races and watching the action. How-
ever, if you want to be an"active" member
of the road racing team, your preferences,

skills, and attitude will be evaluated. You

 

‘will then be placed in a position that is suit-
able to you and that will best contribute to
the most important goal of the team . .

winning! You will be asked to perform
duties beyond the point that you now con-
sider your absolute limit, and in a brief time
you will realize you hayelearned things that
previously you thought you could never
learn. ‘

WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST FOR
ALL THIS ?

Membership is absolutely free for
everyone. As far as race weekend costs are
concerned, both active and spectator mem-
bers pay for their own meals. Both types of
members will usually be provided with free
transportation. Active members will enjoy
free lodging; spectator members will pay
about $2 per person per night. Active mem-
bers will be admitted to the track free of
charge. Spectator members will pay the
usual weekend admission rate. It seems
probable, however, that an attractive dis-
count in admission will be made available to
large numbers of spectator members in.the
upcoming season.

HOW CAN I JOIN ?

Simply complete the form on the back
of this brochure, detach it and drop it off at
either the Towers main desk or the Student
Union Desk. You will receive your member-
ship card in the mail along with notification
of the next general meeting of the term.

As to the team fortunes this
year, Kruth commented, "We
have an excellent chance to make
the nationals this year if we beat‘
our main competition.“ He sees
the Bucknell and West Chester
as extremely. crucial.

“Lets ‘face it,last year’s close
loss to Bucknell cost us the trip

also a perennial competitor for a
bid so we have to beat these two
teams.”

The teams first regular season

"The freshman team is work-
ing in with the varsity squad." re-
lated Coach Quinter, who is in his
second year with the Cubs.‘

“They’ve been split up and put
into groups with the varsity play-
ers for fundamental work.”

Quinter is running the football
practices for “working mainly on
fundamentals. . . . All the fresh-
man need work on fundamentals.

Although he firmly believes in
the importance of basic skills to a
football team, Quinter also firmly
believes in winning.

“I’m a believer in winning,”
stated the coach. “I don’t go onto
a football field to lose.”

An example of Quinter’s deter- '

mination to win was last season's
contest against the Little Lions of
Penn State.

With seconds left in the game,
the Pitt freshmen led the Lions by
six points. On.a fourth down play,
the Cubs went for a field goal. A
fumble was made on the play and
Penn State recovered, running the
distance for a touchdown. They
added the extra point and beat
the Cubs.

One might suspect that Quin-
ter, with only seconds left in the
game, was allowing his kicker to
acquire some game experience by
letting him try for the’ field goal.
That, however, did not prove to
be the case.

. “I was out to win that game,”

I said Quinter. “I just got tied up

emotionally in the game and I
wanted to score some points.”

Quinter expects his ‘71 oppon-
ents to be hard to beat again this
year. "1 understand that Kent
State had a pretty good year in

recruiting and Penn State has

more freshman than they‘ve ever
had as far as numbers—-if num-
bers mean anything in reference
to potential. ‘

BILL QUINTER
In Second Year

Compared to the freshman
teams of the past two years,
Quinter feels that “this year’s
Pitt freshman team has as much
talent as the last two, although
not as many scholarship people as
last year.”

This season Coach Quinter and
his Cubs are out to win. “We
hope to win all three games—if we
win only two that’s better than
‘last year."

1971 Harrier Squad 7

      

   

I by MARK SIGMON

4 Despite the loss. of four runners from the 1970 cross country team.— .2
including All-American Jerry Richey. Coach Jim B
downgrade the chances of the 1971 harrier squad.

“It is hard to predict how well this year's team will do." remark-
ed Banner. since only a week of formal practice has been held so far."

Coach Banners biggest headache right now is the eligibility situa-

tion regarding Mike’ Schurko. who finished in the top 25 in the 1970‘ 
IC4A cross country championships. I

“Mike has ,no academic prob-
lems,” explained Banner. “Mike
transferred from Penn State two
years ago, therefore, he was re-
qpired to skip a year of,competi-
tion, according to NCAA rules.
However, Penn State now refuses
to grant him his final season,
claiming he is a fifth-year.stu-
dent.” .-

Besides the loss of Richey. this
season's harriers will be without
the services of the graduated
‘Greg Rodgers, Mark Vornhagen,
and Mike Nolan. All three were
three-time letter winners for the
Pitt cross country team.

There are -two bright spots in
Coach Banner’s early season line-
.up. Juniors Dave Szabat and Dave
Cheseborough, who piaced num-
bers 16 and 21, respectively, in
last year’s IC4A meet, will be
counted upon heavily in the team’s
first few encounters this season.

Other harriers whom Coach
Banner will be banking on are un-
derclassmen John Black, Ken Sil-
ay, and Ken Balkey.

Some of Banner’s promising
freshmen recruits include Easton
High’s Mickey Collins (1971 PIAA
mile champ), Bob Schurko
