Nearly four years ago, the_Pitt
campus police sought out the Fra-
ternal Order of Police as its bargain-
ing representative. The order
agreed, but only on the condition
that the campus police be classified
under Pennsylvania Act III.

The statute. applying to most
policemen and firemen in Pennsyl-
vania, provides for binding arbitra-
tion in cases where negotiations
under collective bargaining agree-
ments have become deadlocked.

Act I I I, enacted in I968 to avert
disruptions in maintaining public
safety caused by work stoppages,
makes arbiters‘ rulings binding on
both disputing parties. Previously
classified under Act I95. which cov-
ers state public employees and

‘includes no arbitration provision,

campus police officers were granted
new classification in the spring of

ruling was overturned by Common-
wealth Court last August. After
hearing testimony from both sides
last Wednesday, the State Supreme
Court is currently reviewing Lodge
99‘s appeal of the overturning.

The order contends that since Pitt
is a “political subdivision of the
commonwealth,” as defined in Act
I I 1, its police officers can seek bind-
ing arbitration when stalemates halt
negotiations. Under Act I95, the
employees’ only recourse to stale-
mates is to strike.

“I don’t think the Commonwealth

case that was needed," said Sgt.

Lodge 99. “It only addresses a small

that as part of the basis for our

Posvar makes
final request
for state aid

By John Gambescia
The Pitt News

After meeting with members of
the state assembly, Pitt chancellor
Wesley Posvar thinks the university
will receive the amount of state aid
proposed by Governor Richard
Thornburgh in his recent budget
proposal.

Posvar and several other univer-
sity officers traveled to Harrisburg
last Monday and delivered Pitt's
I984-85 budget presentation to the
General Assembly of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania.

“We expect to get [in financial
aid] what the governor has recom-
mended, and if we are very lucky, we
might get a little more,“ Posvar said.

Posvar said the $300 million-plus
Pitt is expected to‘ receive from the
state will be used for staff and
faculty salaries, increased utility
costs and other budget items.

“We have almost never received
what we asked for." Posvar said,
“but we have a recommended 7 per-
cent increase over last year, so we
will make the difficult allocations
between tuition. compensation and
program priorities."

The budget report revealed that in
the I985-84 fiscal year. revenues
sources came from the following:

percent:

0 State appropriations -— 27.4
percent"

race with I53 delegates won to
Mondale‘s I20. Another 39 dele-
gates were uncomitted with
McGovern picking up 21, Jesse
Jackson 16 and John Glenn 12.

Mondale still leads Hart in the
overall delegate count with 278
versus Hart’s 197. Glenn is a
receding third with 29.

Glenn failed to win any of yes-
terday’s contests but nevertheless
called the results “mixed.” He
said that his campaign “remains
very much alive.”

The next contest will this Sat-

Police track robbery suspect

By Patti Bechan
The Pitt News

A suspect is being sought in con-
nection with a series of armed rob-
beries that occured on the Pitt
campus during Jan. 1984, according
to James Watters, Pitt's assistant
director of public safety.

Watters said a warrant ‘for the
arrest of Robert Harris, 25, of East
Liberty, was issued on the morning
of March 5, I984. It charged Harris
with four separate counts of armed
robbery.

At the time the warrant was
issued, campus police attempted to
arrest Harris at a residence where
they believed he had been staying.
“Unfortunately, Harris is a drifter.
there. The individual living there
told us he hadn’t seen Harris in two
weeks," Watters said.

_Watters expresses hope that Har-
ris would be found by the end ofthis
week. He pointed out that this may
be difficult since, “Harris is a drifter.
He has no job and no permanent
residence. He’s also a California
native, and we hope he is not on his
way across country.”

Police believe Harris’ crime spree
began on Jan. ll, 1984 in the park-
ing lot adjacent to the Syria
Mosque.

At 6: l0 p.m., two Pitt female staff

‘The victims had all
given a similar descrip-
tion of the assai-
lant... We were certain
that we were dealing
with one individual.’

members were approached by a gun-
man who demanded their money. At
this point, according to police
reports, the suspect became dis-
tracted and fled.

On that same evening, only 20
minutes later, Oakland police
received a report that two female
employees of Children’s Hospital
had been approached by an armed
male who had demanded their
money. The two gave him their
money, and he fled.

Four days later, on Jan. l5 at 6:30
p.m., a female Pitt student reported
to campus police that an armed man
had demanded her money while she
was attempting to get into her car on
O’Hara street. The victim reported
that she immediately ﬂed and was
not pursued.

The following day, at 6:10 p.m.,
another Pitt student told campus
police that an armed man had

approached her on ‘Bayard Street.
She reported the man took her
money and fled. A

Watters said, “The victims had all
given similar descriptions of their
assailant. The time of each incident
was similar and all four occurred
within a one-mile radius. We were
certain we were dealing with one
individual.”

According to Watters, campus
detectives began undercover stake
outs of Oakland area parking lots in
an effort to catch the gunman “in the
act.” This proved unsuccessful.

“On Feb. 25, we finally got a
break in this case," said Watters.

Campus police officer William
Kimmel was driving along Univer-
sity Drive, when he spotted a male
approaching a woman who turned
and fled in the direction of his car.
Kimmel pursued the man and gave
him a citation for harrassment. “The
man did not have a gun on him at
this time,” said Watters.

Kimmel’s description of this indi-
vidual proved to be very similar to
the description given by the victims
of the armed robberies.

Campus detectives Kathy Heffron
and Fran Walsh began showing
photo arrays to the robbery victims
who identified Harris.

According to Watters, “The alert
actions of Kimmel and the subse-
quent actions of Heffron and Walsh
led to the warrant for Harris’arrest.”

The Pitt News staff.

Published three times weekly
from September to May; weekly
from May to early August.

A Separate Peace

The university’s administration claims it wants to increase
student access to information and raise the caliber of Pitt's
student body. lncreased access to information is supposedly
part of the purpose in the multi—million dollar computer deals
with Digital Electronics Corporation and AT&T. lfthe admin-
istration is serious about helping Pitt students to study better,
there is an immediate step it can take that many top-level
schools have already taken: keep the library open longer and
establish a 24-hour study room.

The library’s current hours follow no logical order and are
inadequate to serve nearly 30,000 students. The library is pres-
ently open on Mondays through Thursdays, 7:50 a.m. to mid-
night; on Saturdays, 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and on Sundays,
noon -to midnight. Students who live in the dorms and have
roommates are generally forced to stop studying at this time.
All students lose access to the books, microfilms and other
study materials wheri the library closes.

While it is understandable that the library can not stay open
all night due to the huge operating costs of the building and a
safety factor, lengthening the hours would certainly benefit
ambitious students and those who only have limited studying
time due to outside obligations (such as extracurricular activi-
ties, research duties, families or jobs).

Aside from extending library hours, the establishment of a
quiet room reserved strictly for study should be provided for
Pitt students. When the library closes, the room could be
opened for those wishing to continue studying. Pitt student ID
cards could be required for entrance to insure security.

There should be only one means of gaining entry to the
room. At this point, a security officer (who could be a work-
study student) would have a machine that reads the magnetic
strip on the back of the ID cards. This system is of a design
similar to that used by Pitt's cafeteria. The card would identify
the bearer as a Pitt student.

Many universities already have similar systems, including
American University, Ohio State, Ohio University, University
of Wisconsin and Georgetown, for example.

The important thing is that Pitt needs to allow students a

greater opportunity to study. Academics are consistently pro- ,

moted as the reason why we are here. Why not further promote
that idea with extended study hours‘? If the university’s admin-
istration wants Pitt to be the campus ofthefuture, i‘. had better
catch up with the past. The establishment oflonger hours and a
study room IS not unreasonable; it's necessary.

Educational TV

James Autry, a convicted murderer from Texas, is supposed
to be dead by now, but a last-minute court order stopped his

death sentence. Still on death row and scheduled for execution
once again, Autry and his lawyers have tried one more legal
attempt to stop his execution. Autry has requested that his
death by lethal injection be televised.

The Texas courts have denied Autry what would certainly be
his last chance to be a TV star and ordered that the prison
continue with the execution. Why not let him have a little thrill?

By broadcasting the execution, those who are in favor ofthe
death penalty will finally get to see what they've been crying for.
a man‘s death. Or perhaps when forced to understand the
gravity of this business, the horror of institutionalized murder
will convince them of the realities of the death penalty.

In any case, if innocence is later proven, a death penalty is
obviously irrevocable. It is also barbaric and archaic. The
death penalty only kills people; no states have been able to
credibly link changes in crime rates to whether they had a death
penalty. Instead of killing off prisoners, states should pay
closer attention to overcrowding in prisons.

Autry’s desire to be publicly executed, Western-style, could
be the best thing to use to shock death penalty supporters into
realizing that this form of punishment is unjust and cruel.

Voter apathy
appalls
Pitt student

I am writing in response to your
article in Wednesday’s Pitt News. I
find it amazing that the students
here at Pitt are so apathetic to the
country's political system that they
do not even care about the presi-
dency. As it looks right now, educa-
tion could be the most important
issue in the I984 presidential
election.

Many students may not be able to
attend school due to a lack of finan-
cial aid, depending on who is in
office. There is also the nuclear
power question. The future that stu-
dents are “too busy studying for“
may not be a reality. And even if we
survive for the future, will there be
jobs available when we graduate?

It is time for the students to make
a difference in the future. Raise your
voice; register to vote and have a say
on who is in control.

Humane
Society
outlines goals

I am writing to further define the
Humane Society of the United
States‘ position on the use of ani-
mals in biomedical research as
addressed in the March-2 Pitt News.

The Humane Society recognizes
that the use ofanimals in biomedical
research frequently causes pain and
suffering to the animals involved
and that, all too often, this pain and
suffering can not be morallyjustified
by the results of that research. We
actively support the development
and implementation of “alterna-
tives” to the use of animals in bio-
medical research. “Alternatives" are
defined in two parts:

OReplacement, reduction and
refinement. Replacement refers to
any technique which can replace the
use of animals altogether and is the
eventual, desired goal. Reduction
refersto a reduction in the number
of animals used. Refinement refers
to refinement of the techniques used
in order to reduce the distress expe-
rienced by the animals.

0Production of results which lead
to an equivalent conclusion with the
same or greater degree of confidence
as that produced by the system being

replaced. Contrary to the comment

(in the March 2 article) that the-

Humane Society “stands outside the
debate," we are actively involved in
this issue and work diligently with
over 200,000 other concerned indi-
viduals towards the realization of
these goals. .

The Humane Society acknowl-
edges that there have been some
medical and veterinary benefits
which were achieved through scien-
tific research on animals, that there
are researchers who properly care
for their animals and ensure that
they do not suffer and that some
areas of animal experimentation
involve no animals suffering or
abuse. Unfortunately, these catego-
ries represent a minority within
modern biomedical research.

Pro-Life
group pleads
their case

Some relevant information was
missing from the front page article,
“SGB Member: Pro—Life Group
Misused Funds," of Friday, March
2. Considering the fact that both the
president and business manager of
the Students for Life group were
presents at the SGB meeting men-
tioned, more information allowing
the group to respond to Mr.
Abrams could have been easy to
obtain. Nothing like getting all sides
of an issue.

What The Pit! News reporters
neglected to mention was that the
alleged misuse of funds took place
during the I982-83 academic year.
This was two presidents ago for the
group. At that time, funds were not
limited, according to allocation
procedures then, to recruitment and
membership ads. Because those who
handled the funds at that time are no
longer at Pitt, they could not defend
themselves against the charge of
using funds for “ideological mes-
sages,“ as the charges were presented
for the first time at the SGB meeting
last week. Nothing like due process
and fair warning for an accusation,
and in this case, an unfounded one.

Speaking of due process — con-
cerning Abrams’ comment:
“Abrams said that due process did
not come into play because the
actions of the‘ Students for Llfe
group was a ‘blatant violation of
allocation procedures.‘ " I’m sure I
missed a bit oflogic. ls Mr. Abrams

implying that we do away with due
process for anyone accused or guilty

of a violation‘? Would you consent
due process, Mr. Abrams. ifthe vio- 1)
lation was serious but not “blatant“.’
How do you decide what violations
merit due process‘? And what then ~ -
sentencing by a judge and jury of
one?

One more thing  when the issue
is resloved  will The Pitt News
again use page one? Yessir, nothing
like discrediting an organization by
associating it with a memorable
headline.

In defense of

Since your editorial staff has pre-
viously blamed President Reagan
for many things that happened
before he took office (the-state ofthe
economy. inept American foreign
policies and so on), I was not sur-
prised to see you blame him for the
Iran-lraq war (The Pitt News.
March 5. I984).

Although you are aware that both
Iran and Iraq are socialist and reli-
gious. you fail to see what their war 9
really proves: if the human race has
any hope forthe future, it lies neither
in socialism nor in religion. for
neither have brought peace to these

Sexual preference and the role of the family

The future of the family is slowly
but surely being affected by a great
controversy and its impact: homo-

Qt sexuality. The conflict of present

opinions over sexual preference is
not new, but it is becoming activated
by the increasing exposure to homo-
sexuals. Homosexual exposure is
vastly increasing because more men
and women are admitting that they
- are “gay."

Homosexuals have been organiz-
ing in cities and on college campuses
all over the United States. Gay news-
papers and magazines are being
openly displayed on newsstands.
Gay movies are advertised in the sec-

tions ‘of newspapers with those car-
rying G and PG ratings. These
movie listings reach the general
reading audience.

lnpolitics, gays have becomes a
powerful force in cities such as San
Francisco, New York, Chicago and
Washington, D.C. They are fighting
for their civil rights in terms of fair
employment practices, open hous-
ing and their right to “be." A

Homosexuality is increasing in
the community‘. Many people are
coming “out of the closet" and
becoming visible to the public. Par-
ents fear that because a homosexual
son or daughter may never marry,

there will be no offspring and that
the family structure will eventually
be destroyed. Many women can
handle competition from another
female for their men, but when faced
with competition from a gay male,
they are unable to understand how
to compete. The same can be applied
to a man in the reverse situation.
Citizens have organized groups,
including religious groups, that are
condemning homosexuality and
homosexual lifestyles. For members
of these groups, there is but one cho-
ice: heterosexuality. The majority of
society feels justified in condemning
homosexuality; some will quote the

Bible by chapter and verse to sup-
port their views.
According to the most widely

accepted theory of the cause of

homosexuality, children can learn to
be attracted to either of the sexes or
to both, True, they are taught heter-
osexuality as they learn the roles of
their sexes in society, but some
children have experiences that lead
to mistrust or fear of the opposite
sex. Others find it hard to identify
with their-sexual roles as set by
society. In either case, homosexual-
ity may become more comfortable
for them than heterosexuality.

The core of the issue is whether

homosexuality is normal behavior
or sick behavior. This brings upthe

question of whether individuals,

should have free choice in deciding
with whom they feel sexually com-
patible and share their sexual
preference.

Although homosexuality is
deemed socially and morally wrong,
it is [another aspect of life that can no
longer be ignored or overshadowed.
We can only instill in the children of
today the importance of the family
and its structure and then hope that
they choose what they feel makes
them the best people they can be.

Making

In the past year, I have filed two
successful sex discrimination suits

Q with the Human Relations Board of

Allegheny County. These suits, both
of which involved Oakland restau-
rants. were successful because the
proprietors refused to let me apply
for a particularjob because I was the
wrong sex.

These small victories have been
quite satisfying. I learned a little
about the law, made a few dollars,
and best of all, l had the extreme
pleasure of legally reprimanding two
lawless and arrogant small
businessmen.

l initiated the first suit in Dec.
I982 and received a settlement check
as back pay eight months later. The
second suit began last November,
and the settlement check arrived two
weeks ago.

Both cases were almost identical. I
heard about the job openings
through the,Pitt Placement Office.
Both times, I was told that only
females were hired for the position
that l wanted, and that this was ille-
gal, both places said they knew that,
but they would do as they pleased.

Both cases were almost identical. I

the legal system

females were hired for the position
that I wanted, and that this had been
the establishment’s policy for some
time. When I informed them that
this was illegal, both places said they
knew that, but they would do as they
pleased.

It is a violation of Pittsburgh code
(Chapter 659.02), to state a prefer-
ence for one sex or the other in job
hiring. Businesses often employ one
particular sex for certain positions.
In lower paying jobs, especially in
food services, females are preferred
over men. Why this is, I don't know.
Perhaps females are perceived as
more honest and diligent than
males. Maybe thev are cuter or more
pleasing to the customer's eye.
Whatever the rationale behind this
practice, technically it's illegal.

When I decided to file my first
suit, l had no idea that any money
was at stake. Filing the second suit
may have been slightly influenced by
the promise of a settlement, but in
both cases, I was basically conduct-
ing an experiment. This, to me, is as
valid a use of the law as any. Legal
laboratories such as courts and
agencies abound in this country, so
why not take advantage of them.
Besides, it's the American way.

As a result of my experience, l

have formulated what I believe to be
a fairly original view of American
law and the American legal system.

“America is ruled by laws, not
men.” “Justice is blind.” These
cliched views of the law imply that
America's legal sytem is essentially

an egalitarian blanket of fairness

and rationality, resistant to the
major/flaws of autocratic or arbi-
trary rule. This static and distorted
view of the laws is just another
chunk in the crowded mosaic of the
American myth. The law is hardly
the sacred institution many believe it
to be. One actually attempting to use
the law to right a wrong will find that
it is often slow, bulky, confusing and
incredibly stupid. But deep down,
every American, including myself,
believes that the law, for all its short-
comings, is meant to be obeyed and
enforced.

The law is definitely not a panacea
for the lawful. Unethical lawyers
and businessmen know this as well
as anyone. The law is like a weapon
— a gilded sword that can -be
wielded by the lawful and lawless
alike for selfish personal gain as well
as selfless improvement of the
whole. The law of this land makes
everyone a potential legal guerilla.
By this, I mean that the law gives
every citizen the opportunity to

Somewhere in Oakland/ William Pierce

'A new notion of power

In an interview with Secretary of
State C eorge Shultz in The Wall
Street Journal, Schultz made a point
in referring to U.S. power: Can the
United States apply limited force in
a situation in which we aren‘t sure of
our goals over a sustained period?

Putting aside questions of moral

. or immoral use of force for the time

being, this statement brings to mind
something that may even be more
dangerous than a policy of force
itself. Does George Shultz under-
stand exactly what is implied about,
not force as a policy, but‘the nature
of force?

Does. Shultz —~ and presumably
the Reagan Administration — have
any clear understanding of the
nature of force today? A global
superpower possessing vast resour-

‘ ces unmatched by any other nation

in the world, the United States has
trouble using this influence. So why
is that? To look back at Shultz’s
statement, the answer is quite easy to
pinpoint. He doesn’t seem to under-
stand the nature of force in the world

today.

The old notions of conventional
applications of force are not the
same in today’s conﬂicts. In the past,
with great state-to—state conflicts
involving national resources and
defined and desired political and
military outcomes, force was easier
to apply. Also, as a result, it was
easier to convince the public that
such action ‘was necessary.

Policy was easily demonstrated.
ln World War 11, if Germany had

conquered Europe, life in the United

States would have been markedly
altered. Thus, we sent our boys to
save the world and bring it back into
balance. Another reason for invol-
vement might have been in the inter-
est of preserving the then-current
U.S. lifestyle. Today, suchconflicts
could quite literally mean the end of
the world. Thus, smaller conﬂicts
grasp our attention, and their level
of importance is raised.

The politcal and military origins
of these new conflicts (Korea, Viet-
nam, Lebanon, Grenada) are not

easily defined or enunciated. The
small bands of highly motivated,
though most often poorly equipped,
groups can do serious damage and
destruction to the U.S.’s high-
powered military machine.

Vietnam was the pinnacle of this
lesson, and our leaders should have
learned. But, apparently, gauging

' from Schultz’s comment, they have

not. This is not to say force cannot
be applied correctly. This is not to
say force need be military in nature.
This doesn‘t say force is justified or
moral. That discussion is for
another time and place.

What this does say is that our cur-
rent leaders — Reagan, Mondale et
al. — do not understand the nature

of force today. And that, beyond the‘

question of whether or not force is a
legitimate tool, is the scariest
thought. lt’s like not understanding
that gas and fire, when combined,
will explode, but still striking a
match in a house full of fumes. Mil-
itary force is useful, but together‘

with inept leaders, it is dangerous.

ambush anyone perceived to be out-

a legal attack will yield significant or

example. Some satisfaction is
possible.

But alas, in my case, it was a mere
flesh wound, a one-battle victory in
a raging border war. Aside from a
few extra dollars for myself, no one
is any better off because of my legal
battles. These establishments are not

ically, they have probably benefitted

Scholar confronts arms critics

By Gary Hardcastle
The Pitt News

The United States arms transfers
to foreign countries have not
increased dramatically, as many
critics have contended, but in fact,
have been relatively stable since
l950, according to Michael Salo-
mone, associate dean of the College
of Humanities and Social Sciences
at Carnegie-Mellon University.

“The picture of the U.S. promis-
cuously pushing arms is incorrect. It
just doesn't happen," Salomone said
yesterday in a lecture presented to
the Pitt Arms Race Study Group
entitled “Lies, Damn Lies, and Arms
Transfer Statistics: An Analysis of
Arms Transfer Trends, i950-I980."

Salomone maintains that one rea-
son American arms transfers are
perceived as growing at an alarming
rate is that “serious methodological
errors have been committed by scho-
lars examining security assistance
trends.”

One common error, he said, is the
tendency to evaluate arms transfers
in current dollars--as opposed to
constant dollars--which applies to a
period of several years. Moreover,
the practice of examining only arms

 

Michael Salomone

sales, which have risen sharply in
recent years, and not free arms
transfers, which have declined, dis-
torts the findngs of some scholars,
he said.

Most importantly, Salomone
contended that “most analysts fail to
consider the linkage of arms
transfers to critical U.S. foreign
interests."

He also pointed out that, between
I974 and I982, inflation alone
would have caused a dramatic exag-
geration of over I00 percent in arms
transfer figures if these totals had
been considered only in current

dollars. 1

At one point in the lecture, Salo-
mone acknowledged that his views
“may not be popular" with local
arms race study groups. He empha-
sized, however, that he and his col-
legues have supported their
conclusions with data on actual
arms transfers over the last 30 years.
Previous studies, he noted, exam-
ined only relatively recent arms
transactions, and often in current
U.S. dollars.

Salomone also attempted to dis-
pel the belief that arms are handed
out indiscriminately. He contended
that decisions to transfer arms to
foreign countries are often subject to
the highest security scrutiny by
Congress.

Responding to recent criticism of
U.S. arms policy,Salomone com-
mented that “either we’re going to
play the game or we‘re not. If we
don't, we may have to suffer the con-
sequences ofa decrease in our ability
to influence events around the
world."

Liane Norman, 21 Pitt English pro-
fessor, said,“lt's unfortunate that
the human standpoint doesn't seem
to be relevant here. The damage, in
human terms, resulting from two
billion dollars worth of military aid,
can be tremendous.“

Soviet diplomat urges talks

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

‘l“The"United States and the
Soviet Union can either live
together, or they can die
together," said Soviet diplomat
Yevgeniy N. Kochetkov. guest
speaker at a lunchoen lecture
entitled “U.S.—U.S.S.R. Rela-
tions: Prospects for Improve-
ment” held yesterday by the
World Affairs Council of Pitts-
burgh and the Triangle Corner.
Ltd.

In the past. both countries
have increased production and
deployment of nuclear weapons
to ensure greater national secur-
ity, but Kochetkov said that
security can only be attained
through reciprocal arms controls
aimed at ;itopping or reducing
arms expansion. He said that to
keep peace, the two countries
must engage in good relations
such as a detente, thus deterring
aggression created by the arms
race.

Previous attempts at arms con-
trol. such as'the SALT I and
SALT ll talks, have failed.
Kochetkov said. because the Uni-
ted States and other NATO
countries wanted arms reduction
from the U.S.S.R.. but at the

same time offered to give up (

nothing in return.

“They wanted us to cut while
they basically increased arms
production. This notion was ri-
diculous!" he said.

The Moscow-born Kochetkov
graduated from the Moscow
School of Diplomacy in I974. He
was later assigned to the United
States desk in the U.S.S.R. Min-
istry of Foreign Affairs where he
participated in the SALT II
treaty negotiations in Geneva.
He also served as executive secre-
tary of the Soviet contingent of
the joint U.S.S.R.-U.S. standing
consultative commission that
monitored compliance with
bilateral arms control agree-
ments. He is currently counselor
of the U.S.S.R. Embassy in

saying there is room for
negotiation.

“Chernenko said,‘We are open

Soviet Union.“ Kochetkov said.

He suggested several initiatives

After the lecture. several
members of the audience offered
reactions to Kochetkov's state-
ments.

Former U.S. Diplomat to the
Soviet Union George Vukmanic
felt that Kochetkov spoke the

realistic view of the relations
between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. He said he believed the
problem with the US. is that "we
don‘t really understand who they
are or what they are.“

Nick Lane. of the Pittsburgh
Conference on Soviet Jewry. said
Kochetkov avoided offering
solid facts or specific refcnces.

“They seem to be taking a
much harder line than usual." he

said.
Kochetkov said he believes
that world peace is seriously

threatened by the escalated
nuclear arms race between the
two countries.

decision

(-onﬁnuedfrom page one

0 Government grants and con-
tracts -— l7.5 percent:

0 Miscellaneous —— l.2 percent.

Also present during the budget
hearing was Ken Stram. the presi-
dent of the Student Government
Board. Stram said he attended the
hearing to enable him to better
understand the whole university
budget allocation process.

“The students are often weary of
why certain budget cuts are made
and why departments are elimi-
nated.“ Stram said. “This is the per-
fect opportunity for me to better
understand the complexities in the
universitv budget."

Stram said Posvar told the assem-
bly that Pitt was a major research
institution in need of the requested
revenues. Posvar also outlined the
three main needs at Pitt  faculty
compensation. advanced computing
and information systems and scien-
tific equipment and instrumenta-
tion. Stram also said that other con-
cerns of the assembly were the high
tuition cost of the.medical school
and the low number of hours Pitt
faculty spend in the classroom per
week. Pitt faculty spend approxi-

mately 9.l hours in»the classroom it

each week; the state average is ll
hours per week.

Stram said Posvar responded by
saying Pitt professors don‘t spend as
much time in the classroom because
they spend more time on research.

Pitt police appeal court ruling

continued./"ram page one

The Vice-Chancellors Office of
Administration, which handles con-
tract negotiations and is represented
by the Reid, Smith, Shaw & McClay
law firm, contends Pitt is not a polit-
ical subdivision of the common-
wealth. The university maintains
that it is an “instrumentality” of the
state and that its management is left
to the control of the 36-member

board of trustees, as outlined in a

I966 act.

According to a brief the firm filed
with the court last week, the act pro-
vided that “The...management, con-
trol and conduct of the
instructional, administrative and
financial affairs of the university
is...vested in the board of trustees.
The board may exercise all the
powers...of the university and make
bylaws for their own government. as
well as for the university.”

Campus police officers, whom
Chester claims are “now in limbo,"
have been working under a contract
signed in l976 —- which expired in
I979. That three-year deal was com-
pleted after a two-week strike by
campusvpolice occurred during the
1976 Homecoming festivities.

Ever since Lodge 99 moved to
change its bargaining agent in
August I979 fromthe guard workers
union to the order of police, the 85-
member force has been without a
new contract and union
representation.

“The present contract is being
adhered to by the university except
for, in their words, yearly salary
increases," Chester said. “Right
now, it’s our opinion that neither
[the union nor the order] is our legal
representative. We are in limbo.

You’ll get an attorney who will give
you his position, but that's our
position.“

That contract provided $l5,000
yearly salaries for first-year officers.
The graduated-salary scale goes no
higher than $18,000 for officers on
the force three years or more. Bene-
fits include six sick days per year.
premium ‘pay for working seven
holidays per year and coverage
under the Blue Shield—Blue Cross
medical plan, among others.

‘Right now, l't’S 0147'
opinion that neither
(the union nor the
order) is our legal
representative. We are
in limbo. ‘You'll get an
attorney who will give
you his position, but
that's our position.’

— Sgt. James Chester

The contract does not include
supervisory staff, like Lt. James
Watters. Supervisors are considered
university personnel and adhere to
the university grievance procedure.

Watters said he is “neutral to the
situation.“ He will not “hazard a
guess“ on how the State Supreme
Court will rule but noted a trend
during the last decade that he said
explains the university's position.

“During the l970s, police arbiters
were, I think, generally giving out
pretty attractive awards," Watters
explained. “They were making up
for police’s traditionally not receiv-
ing adequate pay or benefits.

“The attractiveness of those
awards in the '70s stimulates this
kind of situation. I'm not sure that
era is over, but it does have some-
thing to do with it."

That trend has slowed somewhat
as the police forces of the Philadel-
phia Housing Authority, Temple
University and the city of Harris-
burg have already attempted to
change classification from Act 195
to Act I l I.

None of those agencies have yet
been allowed to be covered by Act
III. The university sees campus
police as having limited jurisdiction
in that the force supplements those
of the city, county and state. It is

Pitt’s position that public safety’

would not bejeopardized were cam-
pus police not available.

Regardless, Watters concurs with
Chester that “everybody is in limbo”
and said he senses a need to draw up
a new contract.

“There’s certainly going to have to
be action," Watters continued.
“There's a need for us to sit down
and get something viable. It's just a
matter of the courts‘ getting their
determination."

The State Supreme Court. Ches-
ter said, can rule in two ways -- that
"the University of Pittsburgh police
are police or [that] the University of
Pittsburgh is a subdivision of the
commonwealth to the extent that it
fulfills the requirements of Act I l l.“
Either decision, Chester said, would
favor the campus police officers.

Have you wondered about the possibility of majoring in two
sub'ects at once in graduate school? According to Graduate
an Professional Pro rams: An Overview ,volume 1 of ‘Peter-

Law is the most common combined-degree field, and the
most common program leads to the J.D./M.B.A. with

Greeks form unification group

By Colette Ferris
The Pitt News

The Fraternity Unification Com-
mittee, a subcommittee of the Inter-
fraternity Council, urged Pitt's
Greek system to initiate a strong uni-

C fication movement at its first meet-

ing last night. A result of the
abolition of the fraternity system at
Amherst ‘College, the Fraternity
Unification Committee was formed
in an attempt to avoid the occur-
rence of a similar event at Pitt.

At last night‘s meeting, Tony
DeFiore, council secretary and
chairman ofthe new committee, said
that with eight fraternities moving
into the new housing complex this
fall, a stringent unification is
needed. '

“Since fraternities are separate
entities from the university but work
with the university, a precaution is

. needed,” DeFiore said. “The com-

mittee will serve as that type of task
force.
“We would like to show the uni-
versity that we are a unified system,”
said DeFiore. “We are an adjunct of
IFC and want to set up specific goals
‘to bett¢i"unify the system.“
With the move up to the com-

-plexes, DeFiore said, one minor
may draw unnecessary .

incident
‘attention to the fraternity system,
C the university and the surrounding
community.
‘ “Through the committee meet-

L: ings, any immediate problems can
. beidiscussed and ideas suggested to

unite the fraternities on the hill and
‘lower campus,“ DeFiore explained.

W/‘DeFiore pointed out that friendly

relationships within each fraternity
are good. However, he believes true
friendships between the individual
fraternities are “rotting away”due to
senseless bickering. This area of
communication is one the commit-
tee hopes to strengthen in its attempt

‘to foster solidarity within the Greek
svstem.

Amherst Greeks: ‘We
were victims ofpress’

By Colette Fen'Is
The Pitt News

Why? This is a question that is
still being asked by many stu-
dents of Amherst College. Why
was the fraternity system at
Amherst abolished‘?

“We still don't know why it A

was abolished," said Ralph
Cummins. editor of Sidelines,
Amherst’s entertainment
newspaper.

According to Cummins,
Julian Gibbs, a former Amherst
president. was conducting an
investigation of the fraternity
system. and soon after his death
in the spring of I983, the findings
of the report, known as the
White Report. were released.

“Gibbs was pro-fraternity in
some aspects and anti-fraternity
in others, but he was fair.“Cum-
mins said. However, G. Armour
Craig, the acting college presi-
dent after the death of Gibbs,
was "blatently anti-fraternity,”
said Cummins.

“We were definitely victims‘ of
the press.“ said Dan Franzese.
vice-president of the Interfrater-
nity Council at Amher'st. “The
media portrayed us as type of
‘Animal House.‘ and the admin-
istration thought this tarnished
the reputation of the college."

According to Franzese, there
were many past fraternity
reports circulating which evalu-

ated the good and bad sides of I‘

the fraternity system.

“We've tried to reform our sys-
tem by eliminating hazing and
allowing women to join our

‘We were deﬁnitely vic-
tims of the press... The
media portrayed us as a
type ofAnimal House. ’

--Dan Franzese

groups, but it appeared that the .
administration had been out to
get us for years," Franzese said.
“I guess the actions ofthe frater-
nities during the years we weren‘t
here had a lot to do with the final
decision to eliminate the‘
Greeks." . I

Since I945, Amherst had ques-
tioned the necessity of a frater-
nity system. at the all-male
school and had lead investiga-
tions into this

In I975, not only did Amherst
College become co-educational,
but so did the fraternity system,
as well. .

According to Rebecca Hantin,
editor of Amherts‘s The Student.
there was a forced quota for each
fraternity to have a certain
number of female members.

“Most of the fraternities lost
their national charters for one
reason or another," Hantin
explained, “but one primary rea-
sons which Ied to charter revoca-
tions was the admittance of
female members.”

Hantin explained that the
week before~the final decision
was made. a fraternity-led
hunger strike and sit-in took

place.

Cancer risks

called choice ,5,

of individual
By Lisa B. Keer
The Pitt News

What level of cancer risk is consi-
dered acceptable is a question the
individual must decide, according to
Carnegie—Mell0n economics profes-
sor Lester B. Lave.

“We can‘t simply wish away
(these) problems," Lave said. during
yesterdays Contemporary Chemi-
cal lssues and Public Policy lecture.
sponsored by Pitt‘s chemistry
department.

Lave said it is impossible to “do
away with all the risks" associated
with chemicals and chemical by-
product production. Chemical

agents present in food are an exam» 975‘

ple of this, he said.

The Environmental Protection
Agency has set the level of one
cancer occurence per 100,000 life-
times as a level it finds acceptable for
humans. The Food and Drug
Administration, however, has set
the level at 1 cancer occurence per l
mill-ion lifetimes for food products.

These figures are of particular
interest when considering the con-
troversy which surrounded the
chemical EDB a few months ago,

Lave said. He set the risk contract— Q

ing cancer after a lifetime of eating
products containing EDB at l
cancer occurence in I0 million to I00
million lifetimes. Statistics say that
approximately l80,000 people die of
cancer each year.

Lave said he agreed with the deci-
sion of Secretary ofthe Interior Wil-
liam Ruskelshouse to stop using
EI)B in food products, but he added

that he did not agree with taking.

those products. particularly cake
mixes. off the shelves.

Lave said that there are approxi-
mately 70.000 chemicals used in the
United States today. with about
another l.000 introduced each year.

The Toxic Substance Control Act
dictates that before any chemical is
introduced for use. the producing
company must have the permission
of the Environmental Protection
Agency and the firm must prove the
substance to be non-toxic and non-
carcinogenic.

One method of testing chemicals
is “prohibitive," according to Lav

e
because it requires at least 3 to M

years to complete at a cost of as
much as one million dollars. “I dare
say there would not be many new
chemicals introduced.“ he said.

There are other less expensive
methods to test for carcinogens and
toxicity. y

The Ames test costs about $200 to
run. and tests the mutation rate of
plants and animals. It does not mea-
sure cancer rates. he said. but a close
correlation for cancer risk can be

made. .5

Lave said if all cancer-causing
agents ofall 70.000 TSCA-approved
substances were combined. the rate
of cancer in humans would run at l
cancer occurence in l5 lifetimes. The
national average is three cancer

SIX-PACKS TO GO

 

BY DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Its no longer a conflict. It’s surpassed. a police action. its
an all-out war.

A pizza war, that is.

Oakland pizza shops are currently engaged in a battle for
the college students’ business. Their tactics include smother-
ing area newspapers with advertisements announcing price
cuts, special coupons and free soda.

When and how this outbreak began is a matter of debate
among pizza shop owners.

“The price wars are a direct result of Domino’s," insists
John Volna, owner of Mother John’s pizza shop on Centre
Avenue. “Most of the small shops don’t have the oven
capacity to compete, and we don’t have the money for
advertising.” »

Volna said that franchises like Domino’s and the recently-
opened Four Star Pizza have changed delivery into a race
and have instigated smaller shops to find other ways to
attract-customers.

Domino’s guarantee of 30-minute free delivery or $3 off of
your next pizza and its large amount of advertising in
college newspapers puts “the small guys up against a brick
wall," Volna said.

Smaller pizza shops can compete only by cutting their
prices. Costs on the less expensive items — boxes, sauces,
etc -- are minimized. This is the only way for places like
Capri, Mother Johns and Napoli to remain competitive,
especially with beat-the-clock guarantees like Domino's.

“When it comes to a 33 savings, students would definitely
rather wait for their pizza," Volna said. “Money is more
important than time, especially when students’ are just
sitting around studying.”

“It seems to me that the other pizza shop
owners want to cut each other’s throats.”

Art Trapolsi
Caesa r’s Pizza

Art Trapolsi, owner of Caesars Pizza on Forbes Avenue,
has a less complicated explanation for the cause of the
pizza war.

“Basic greed," he said. “One person wants all the business

is what it comes down" to. It seems to me that the other pizza

shop owners in the Oakland area want to cut each other’s
throats."

But no one business is going to get all the customers,
according to Mark Latvala, owner of the Western Pennsylva-
nia Domino’s. T

“It's like the pie theory," he said. “There's a pie cut in so
many pieces, and each of the competitors gets his piece of
the pie. Realistically, we know that every pizza shop in the
area is going to get at least a little slice of the pie."

Latvala doesn't consider the smaller pizza shops in
Oakland competition for Domino's, but the similarity
between Domino's and Four Star is keeping Domino's on its
toes.

“Four Star interests us a lot more than the other places,"
said Latvala.

John Shofield, director of store development at six Domi-
no’s locations, including Oakland, does not consider his store
the cause of the price battles.

“If we were the cause of it, they {the small shops) would
be promoting mainly service, but'they’re going for the
prices,” he said. “We’re not even competing with them in
prices, When you get someone who‘s‘a little more estab-
lished (like Domino’s], the other places are going to resent
that.“

Alan Cottrill, the owner of Four Star, worked for Domino’s
before opening his own chain. He said this is the only one of

Four Star's 14 stores that is involved in this kind of
competition.

“I‘ve never seen it like this anywhere in the country," he
said. “We've got a lot of campus and military stores, but this
is something else. You might see a dollar-off coupon, but
nothing like this." “

The owner of Capri Pizza on Forbes Avenue, who did not
want her name revealed, said there is no price war among
pizza shops.

“There is no pizza war," she said. “If people want to call it a
pizza war, let them call it what they want.“

some pizza parlors haven't bothered entering the price
competition. Sorrento’s on Atwood Street, for example,
charges $3.50 for an eight-cut plain pizza and $4.55 for a
I2-Cut. ‘

Bellisario's owner Oriente Sciulli said he doesn't believe in
sales. He said that the pizza wars might mean less Pitt
students, but he still gets enough Pittsburgh residents that
his business isn't substantially affected.

“I have my established regular prices,” he said. “These
[price wars] are getting worse every day."

A small plain pizza from Bellisario’s costs $3, a medium is
$3.50, a large is $4 and an 18-incher costs $5.

Trapolsi is also keeping away from the price wars,
charging $3.50 for a plain 12-inch pizza, $4.50 for a medium,
$5 for a large and $5.50 for an 18-inch extra large.

“I don't have any problems surviving because people who
want quality will pay for it,"he said.

Whether students look for quality, price, delivery or other
things when ordering pizza was tested when Mary Hinter-
lang, an Oakland resident and recent ‘Pitt graduate, and a
group of friends timed and judged six local pizza shops.

At 8:15 p.m., during her brother's birthday party one
Saturday night a few weeks ago, Hinterlang and 30 friends

ordered pizzas from Penguinni's, Domino’s, Sorrento’s, Napo-'
li’s, Capri and Caesar's.

Eighteen minutes and 14 seconds from the time Hinter-
lang dialed the first number on the telephone to place her
orders, thesingle-item large pizza from Napoli’s arrived. A
minute and 24 seconds later, the Domino’s pizza was '
delivered.

It took almost four minutes for the next pizza, from
Penguinni’s, to arrive. Caesar's Pizza came in fourth place,
taking 39 minutes, 54 seconds to arrive; the pizza from
Sorrento's placed fifth at 48 minutes, 10 seconds.

One hour and 20 minutes after calling, a cold Capri pizza
arrived.

Despite its second-place time, Domino’s was nonetheless
judged best by the group. Criteria such as taste, warmth and
greasiness put it over the top. ‘

The pizzas were ordered during the “dinner rush," one of
three especially busy times for Oakland shops. Others occur
from 9 to 1 l p.m. and I to 2 a.m., Decker said. ‘

Delivery schedules are planned around the evening
rushes, which intensify around final exam time. Decker
plans to hire 10 extra delivery people during that period.

Owners say that prices can't go much lower during finals.

“You have to make ‘money. You can't lose money," Volna
said. ‘

Four Star owner Cottrill agrees. “You can't go much lower
without losing profit. You've already lost most of it [at under
$3]. I'm not making anything at $2.89, but I'm building a
customer base. The bottom line is, you have to produce the
best product.”

Aiken rumore

By Chaﬂie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Pitt freshman guard Curtis
Aiken has decided to transfer
and Panther recruit Charles
Smith has backed out of his
verbal agreement to attend the
university, reported college bas-
ketball analyst Dick Vitale last
night on the Entertainment and
Sports Programming Network
(ESPN).

At 8:30 pm, after the
announcement, Vitale told The
Pitt /Vew.s' that “Charlie Smith
changed his mind, I learned this

from a very reliable source close
to the team.“

Vitale elected not to discuss
the Aiken situation in detail.

Panther head coach Roy
Chipman denied both of Vitale‘s
allegations in a interview with
Pittsburgh television station
WPXI on their eleven o’clock
news.

“There’s no essence to the
rumor that Curtis Aiken is leav-
ing,” Chipman said. “The
(Charles Smith) story is unbe-
lieveable. He (Vitale) would
question the credibility of
anyone who goes on national
TV with those undisclosed
sources.”

d gone;

Aiken was unavailable for
comment late last night, but
Smith was interviewed on the
Stan Savran sports talk show on
WTAE last night. He denied the
report, saying there was no truth
to the statement.

I)on Fsmonde, a sports writer
for The Buf/'aIo News who inter-
viewed Aiken a week earlier,
said “Nobody up here knows
anything about it.

“I called his grandmother and
she had heard nothing about it.
As far as I can see, it’sjust Vitale
acting on a hunch."

Aiken practiced with the team
yesterday afternoon in prepara-
tion for I4riday’s night meeting
with l.aSalle in the first round of

the National Invitational
Tournament.

“He would have like to played
more guard (this year), but
there’s no doubt that he's our
starting guard next season,"
Chipman said. “Aiken is very
happy at Pitt.“

Vitale, a former coach with the
University of Detroit and the
Detroit Pistons of the NBA,
recently created a contraversy at
UCLA. I)uring a basketball tele-
cast on ESPN two weeks ago, he
said that head basketball coach
Larry Farmer would be moved
to an adminstrative position in
stead of returning as head coach.

Meanwhile, UCLA maintains
that Farmer will stay on as head

coach next season. Curtls

‘ After the ‘R'ed'men defeated Boston College in
the opening round of last week’s Big East tour-

that Looie ought to be called for a three-second

Carnesecca takes on an air ofcalmnessafter a

questions following last Friday's 79-68 loss to
Georgetown at Madison Sqaure Garden.

Carnesecca has been coaching long enough
to know that Fesperienza means everything to a
tournament—bound team. He also knows that
the experience has been a quality that the Red-
men have at times lacked this season.

The Redmen started the year with unwar-
ranted praise and exaggerated expectations. St.
John‘s found itself nationally ranked, but it
played like something less than a Top 20 team.

Now Carnesecca and his team find them-

lotte. North Carolina.

Some might scoff at their l8-ll record, but
remember. those losses included close game
with North Carolina and I)ePaul.

“I think we have proved that we can play with
anyone in the country.“ said Chris Mullin, St.
John's All-America guard. “If we would have
won two or three of those close games, then
there would have been no question."

Mullin has taken this young team on his back
and carried it into the post-season tournament.
For that, he is the nation‘s most valuable player
in the purest sense. Mullin, more than any other
player on any other team. carries his team.

Lady swimmers face quick

competition at championship 

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

Five Lady Panther swimmers will
be up against the toughest competi-
tion in the country when the NCAA
Championships get underway
Thursday at Indianapolis.

The championship, which runs
through Saturday, is one of the fast-
est women‘s meets in the world,
according to Pitt head coach David
Belowich.

“How close the competition is for
first through twelfth place will be
determined by only hundreths of a
second in almost every event," Belo-
wich said.

Sophomore Alicia Dugan is
inspired rather than intimidated by
the tough competition at nationals.
“I am excited to see how I can do
against the best around," she said.

Tracy Pfister, who will be swim-
ming in the. 200-yard individual
medley, is presently ranked l8th
nationally in the event. She is look-
ing forward to the pressure from the
competition.

“Swimming against the top

swimmers in my event should help
me improve my times.“ she said.

Since the Lady Panthers did not
take part in‘ the Eastern Regional
Championship. they have had four
weeks to train for nationals. The
unusually long training period
allowed the swimmers to do a small
scale taper, which consists ofshorter
but more intense practice sessions so
the swimmers have more time to rest
for a big meet.

“We went back into the weight
room and had tougher workouts for
about two weeks, then we tapered
down again. So. the break between
meets has worked to our advantage
because we were able to overcome
the drag that usually follows a big
meet like the Big East.”

Freshman Jodi O’Neil is hoping
to make All-America at the meet by
placing among the top I2 in the 200-
yard breaststroke. Although this is
her first year in the national cham-
pionship meet, she is confident
about going to Indianapolis.

“It should not be that overwhelm-
ing for me because I have swum at
that pool in several other national
calibur meets," she said.

Susan Hickman, like ()‘Neil, has
swum at the pool before. She
believes she has a good shot at tak-
ing the national title in her specialty.
the 50-yard freestyle because the top
three competitors in the event last
year have graduated.

“Taking a national title of this
calibur has never been this close for
me." she said. “But my first goal is to
make All—America. If I can do that,
l‘ll be happy."

Senior co-captain Denise Sedlack
has set some personal goals for her
final meet.

“I’d like to end my swimming
career on a happy note," she said. “I
want our 200-yard freestyle relay
team to place in the top six. This will
be my best and last meet.”

Coach Belowich is hoping to
accomplish two things at this meet.
First. he wants to see his 200-yard
freestyle relay team set a new
national mark and secondly, he
wants the Lady Panthers to continue
to rise in the national standings.

“We‘d like to stay in the top 20
and possibly go higher than I8.
which we were last year." Belowich
said.

    

Susan Hickman will compete in the 50-yard freestyle
event at nationals this week.

Vaughan gains respect...

Last season, Panther forward Clyde Vaughan led the Big East in
scoring and was second in rebounding yet was named to the league’s
third team. I

Although his statistics were lower this season, the Ieague’s coaches
recognized Pitt’s all-time scoring leader, naming him to the Big East
second team. -

St. John's foward Chris Mullin and Georgetown center Patrick
Ewing were named co-Big East Player ofthe Year while the Syracuse
duo of Coach Jim Boeheim and point guard Dwayne “Pearl"
Washington received Coach of the Year and Rookie of the Year
honors. -

Besides Ewing, Mullin and Washington, Providence center Otis
Thorpe and Boston College forward Jay Murphy were selected to the
first team.

I Rafael Addison of Syracuse, Ed Pinckney of Villanova, David
Wingate of Georgetown and Michael Adams of Boston Collegejoin
Vaughan on the second team. jc The third team consists of Seton
Hall’s Andre McCloud, St. John's Bill Wennington, Georgetown‘s
Michael Jackson, Connecticut’s Karl Hobbs as well as Harold Press-
ley and Dwayne McClain of Villanova.

The All-America roundbaIlers...'.

Ewing and Mullin were also recipients of another honor —- the
United Press lnternational‘s AlI—America team.

Also receiving first team honors were North Carolina’s Michael
Jordan and Sam Perkins and Oklahoma forward Wayman Tisdale.

Named to the second team were Leon Wood of Fullerton State,
.Alvin Robertson of Arkansas, Akeem Olajuwon of Houston, Keith
Lee of Memphis State and Michael Cage of San Diego State.

The third team consists of Illinois‘ Bruce Douglass, Georgia Tech‘s
Mark Price, Kentucky's Melvin Turpin, Brigham Young's Devin
Durrant and Houston’s Michael Young.

Big East players named to the honorable mention squad included

. Jay Murphy of Boston College and Dwayne Washington of Syracuse.

He led Big East scorers with a 24.9

average, out—distancing his nearest.

competition by six points a game.
He was also seventh in the league in
assists, averaging a little over four a
game, and he shot an amazing 9|
percent from the free-throw line.

Mullin plays the game with" an
efficiency of movement and grace
that few can duplicate. He does all
those things that great players —- not
tremendous athletes —- learned to do
before the invention of the slam
dunk and the million-dollar
contract.

He squares up to the hoop in a
ﬂuent motion and releases his shot
with a ﬂick, like a businessman
clearing hisltie of lint. He moves con-
stantly ~——~ with the ball or without,
an defense"or on the fast break. He
plays with the spunk and alertness of
any I4-year-old redhead trying out
for the varsity team. In the words of
his coach, “he enjoys.”

“Of course, Chris Mullin was
great," Carnesecca said after the loss

.  .   .     

to (ieorgetown. “I€ven double, triple
teamed, he showed why we all like
him so much."

Mullin scored 29 points in the loss
to the Hoyas, shooting II) of I4 from
the floor and a perfect nine of nine
from the free-throw line.

Gcorgetown‘s" head coach John
Thompson has seen enough of Mul-
lin in the past three years tojoin the
fan club.

“I like Chris Mullin," Thompson
said. “He is one of myvfavorite play-
ers. I am constantly infrioducing my
players to Chris Mullin,,and by now.
he should be one of their favorite
players.“

Carnesecca had described the play

of Georgetown center Patrick Ewing
as being “deserving of an Oscar."

.When critiquing Mullin's perfor-

mance, Looie paused and said, “He
has won many Oscars; tonight‘s was
a repeat performance.“

The city of New York adopted
basketball as its game long ago, and

when a great player such as Mullin
decides to stay at home, he becomes
king. _

"Go Kwiss," they scream from the
(’iarden’s cheap seats in a strong
Brooklyn accent. Mullin knows they
are there, but his mind is elsewhere
during the game.

“I amjust really wrapped up in the
game," Mullin said. “If the shots are
there, I take them."

Mullin shoots only often enough
to help his team. His fans have come
to expect greatness from the 6-6,

200-lb. junior from Xaverian High 

School.

“When he misses a shot, people
actually get upset," Carnesecca said.

St. John‘s fans might remind
themselves that it was Mullin who
made tomorrow night's NCAA
meeting with the Atlantic I0‘s Tem-
ple Owls a reality. .

“If we could put together a goo
40-minute game," Mullin said, “we
could surprise some people.“

Eastern Wrestling League grips national recognition

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

The Eastern Wrestling League
was formed in I975. Like any new
conference, it lacked the respectabil-
ity of the more prestigious conferen-
ces such as the Big Eight or Big Ten,
but it has grown at a constant pace
each year.

This year, the conference broke
out of its shell and surprised the
nation by scoring an EWL record of
ll0'/2 points to place third out of 17
in conference scoring at the NCAA
Wrestling Championships, » which
were held at the Meadowlands
Arena, March 8—l0.

But that's not the only EWL
record broken this year.

0 The EWL had never had a
national champion. This year they
produced two —~ Penn State’s Carl
DeStefanis (I I8 lbs.) and Scott
Lynch (134 lbs.).

0 The EWL never has mare than.
a-me person reach the semi-finals in
the same year. This year, four EWL
wrestlers hit the Final Four.

0 Penn State finished the tourna-
ment third in the team standings.
The previous high was sixth place,
set by Penn State in l98l.

0 The combined record for the
EWL at the tournament was 55-37.
The most wins in a single tourna-
ment prior to this year was 35.

0 The league produced nine All-
America titles, including Pitt’s Jeff
Jelic; the previous high was five, set
in I981.

“Penn State carried us this year.
They set the pace, not only for the
conference but the whole East," said
Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer,
also the league secretary. “They’re
our arch rival, but you have to
admireia good product.”

Although Penn State led the pack,
scoring 98 ofthe league’s points and
boasting seven of the nine All-
Americas, Lee Richards, EWL pub-
licity director, believes that it was a
combined conference effort.

“The quality of wrestling at
Bloomsburg, Lock Haven, Clarion
and Pitt had been improving con-
sistently in the past two years,” he
said, “Coaching changes in the EWL

show that everyone has made a com-
mitment to the league."

Pitt ‘and Clarion tied for 25th
place in the tournament, each com-
ing away with one All-America,
while Lock Haven placed 28th and
Cleveland 30th.

The EWL also had five wrestlers
that missed All-America honors by a
single win.

Said Stottlemyer, “When it came
down to it, when a Penn State guy
lost a match, he fought back to get
that seventh or eighth place. Some
teams just didn't do that."

Penn State's success was not an
overnight wonder. According to
head coach Rich Lorenzo, it was not
he who caused it, but rather the
athletes.

“It was a gradual, steady improve-
ment. It took a lot of hard work and
planning and getting the right guys
to do thejob," he said. “It wasn't the
coaching or some magic wand com-
ing in and doing it. It was the ath-
lctes that came in and prepared to do
what they had to do, become men-
tally tough enough to go out and

beat kids that are so close in talent to

themselves.

“You also need an administration
that has made a commitment to
wrestling. That’s why we’re getting
more respect now.”

University backing is a major
stepping stone before having a con-
tending team, according to Lorenzo,
who was Penn State’s assistant
coach from I968-74, but resigned
from coaching because of lack of
support from the school’s adminis-
tration. In I979, he returned as head
coach after a firm commitment came
from the athletic department to pro-
duce a top-fight team. I

Penn State’s athletic department
kept its promises, which resulted in
the third—place finish and a I6-2 dual
meet record this year.

But one problem the EWL had in
building the league was keeping all
the high school superstars of the
East in the region.

“Each team in the EWL works to
get the kids from the area, keeping
them in the East and away from the
lowas and the Michigans.” said
Richards.

Sunday 5:00 p.m. —
Lunch Mon - Fri - 11 aim.-3,

Lorenzo agrees and believes that
the tide has turned in favor of the
EWL.

“It was true four years ago that the
kids tended to move away from
here," he said, “but the past couple
years we’ve been able to keep those
top quality wrestlers here for a
number of reasons.”

When you can offer a strong com-
mitment to a growing team, getting a
junior varsity program, scheduling
top competition and forming wres-
tling clubs, then, according to
Lorenzo, “you can keep those big
names in the East.”

Keeping them in the East is one
thing, but getting them into the
EWL is another, especially with the
Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling
Association, the EWL’s main

recruiting rival, boasting national.

contenders Lehigh, Navy and

Syracuse.

“The ELWA has always looked
down on us, but the last two years
the writing‘s have been on the wall,”
said Richards. “With a Jelic, DeSte-
fanis and Lvnch. vou can see that the

EWL sees
bright future

continued from page twenty-seven
caliber of wrestling is getting better
and better."

The EWL was given a shot in the
arm by this year’s finish at the
expense of the EIWA.

The EIWA takes 33 wrestlers to
nationals, the EWL 23, yet this year,
the EWL outclassed their eastern
counterpart by scoring H0‘/3 points
for a third place and nine All-
Amerieas, while the EIW/\ finished
sixth in conference scoring with 70‘/4
points and six All-/\merieas.

The EWL also finished with a
winning percentage of 59 percent to
the ElWA’s 43 percent. .

The numbers add up to a potential
banner year for EWL recruiting,
which will have to be the key next
year ifthe EWL wants to continue to
grow, due to the fact that five ofthe
nine All—Americas will graduate,
including four from Penn State.

“Sure we're going to lose people; it
happens every year," said Lorenzo.
“We'd like to keep them. but we feel
that each has already set a precedent
of excellence: reaching goals, work-
ing hard and being a fine example
for other quality athletes to see and
want to be like. This means we may
‘ose the wrestlers, but we will not

)se the success they have had."

He is also very optimistic about
the future of the EWL, which will
likely be able to take one or two
more wrestlers to next year‘s
national tournament because of its
successful tournament this year.

“All the teams in the EWL could
be Top 20 teams year in and year out
if they get the strong support
needed," he said. “Most ofour teams
have made that commitment.

“Pitt could easily be a consistent
Top I0 team if they would get full
support. They‘ve got the coaching
now. As it stands, they are gradually
building their program, but you
can’t wait too long before a new pro-
gram becomes old without getting
off the ground.“

Penguins show they
still belong in NHL

By Saul Markowitz
For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Penguins lost to
the New York Islanders Sunday
night h-4, their 50th defeat of the
season.

l*ollowing the defeat. Penguin
goalie l)enis Herron said the team
played better than usual because
they wanted to show Pittsburgh they
still belong in the National Hockey
I cague.

All season. they‘\*e been trying to
proxe this point but liaye achieved
little success. Ilie other night. how-
c\ er. they played a much more con-
sistent game. lheir basic problem
was a lack of capitali/ing on good
opportunities in front olithe Islander
net.

The first few minutes of the con-
test was all Islanders. Suddenly. the
Penguins began to get control and
were able to score the lirst goal of the
game. While the Islanders were
shoi't~handed. Doug Shedden
receix ed the puck at the blue line and
took a quick slap shot. which was
deflected between the legs of goal-
tender Billy Smith by Andy
Brieklcy.

Ihe period was well played by
both teams. Both the Penguins and
the Islaiidcrs lorecheckcd and back-
checked with skill. Iwen though the
period ended in a one to one tie. both
teams had their chances to score.
With only three minutes remaining
in the period. Penguin top scorer
Mike Bullard took a tery quick slap
shot that hit the left post of the
Islander goal. I he best chance ofthe
period occurred when Bobbie .Vys-
trom skated down the ice and took a
shot on Herron. The rebound
bounced straight out in front of
Trotter with an open net. Somehow.
Herron was able to slide over and
rob the Islanders ofanother tally. A
grudge match seemed to be brewing
in the (‘ixic Arena.

Well. as the season would base it.
the Penguins lost their momentum
in the second period. It began when
the Pittsburgh club was called for a
penalty. The Islanders pulled their
goaltender for an extra attacker

because the Penguins did not have
full control of the puck. and the
penalty could not be assessed until
this occured. The Islanders took
advantage ofthis lackluster play and
scored their second goal ofthe game.
This time around. it was Olympian
Pat I.al*ontiane. After receiving a
pass from Jonson, he wasted no time
in sliding a low shot under a sprawl-
ing Penguin goaltender. The score
was 2-I in favor of the Islanders.

The Penguins had their chances.
but they couldn‘t score. They were
unable to capitalize because they
were passing the puck and not tak-
ing enough shots. lhey just passed
the puck too many times and seemed
to ha\‘e no idea what to do with it.

The Islanders contimicd to donii—
nate as they scored another goal at
the I l:l5 mark. ()ri a fast break. Bob
Bournc picked up a loose puck and
drilled it home to increase the lead to
3—I.

The Penguins had one last chance
in the period to shorten the lead. but
they shot one off the crossbar with
fixe minutes remaining.

I he third period was to be the best
period of hockey that the Penguins
have played in many weeks. At the
b:5() mark. I)ennis Potyin oi the
Islanders was called off for a
penalty. While on the power play.
the Penguins made a xery crucial
error. Butch (ioring was able to
receiye the puck in the Penguins‘
/one. He pulled goaltender Ilerron
to his stick side and slid the puck
into the lelt hand side ot the net. I he
score was now 4—l Islanders. But the
Penguins didn‘t quit.

I)uring the same power play. the
Penguins were able to score off of a
tip-in by Ron Hoekhart. The play
began as Roulston took a shot from
the right point. Billy Smith was
screened on the play and Flockhart
was at the right spot for the goal.
The margin was now only two goals.

’I wenty-nine seconds later. Brian
lrotteir broke away from the Pen-
guin defensemen and shot one
straight into Dennis Herron. The
rebound squirted loose onto the
stick of Mike Bossy. who had no
problem putting the puck in the net
for the Islanders’ filth goal of the
contest.

Rick Kehoe (right) is one of the veterans on a rebuilding Penguin team.

Both goaltenders had their
moments in the contest. In the third
period. Mike Bullard slapped a shot
that hit Islander goaltender Billy
Smith straight on the left shoulder.
He stated after the contest that the
shot hit him in a spot where he had
absolutely no protection.

I)ennis Herron received his share
when Pat I.aFontaine was checked
tery hard into him. He was then
thrown directly into the net. Both

goaltenders were able to finish the
contest.

At l4:4S. the Penguins made the
score 5-3 when Mark Taylor slid the
puck under Billy Smith. It wasa new
game.

The Penguins big break occurred
at |7:48 in the final period when the
Islanders were able to score a very
Pens were able to score a yery quick
goal by Mike Bullard to almosteven
the score. Bullard was able to pick

up a loose puck in front of the
Islander goal and backhand it in for
a 5-4 score.

Unfortunately. the Penguins
pulled their goaltender with only
moments remaining. and the Island-
ers scored the clincher for a 6-4
victory.

The Penguins continue to own the
cellar in the league. but they can be
proud with their play the other
evening.
