LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

Sex is an idea with which {America contin-
ues to have an uneasy relationship. Par-
ents covered their children’s eyes when

Elvis Presley wildly gyrated his hips on '

live television while performing “Hound
Dog” in the 1950s, unwilling to accept the
emergence of a generation that was much

more willing to express its sexuality. But “

these baby boomers and their children still

cringed and expressed outrage via social

media and on morning talk shows when
Miley Cyrus infamously twerked on stage

at the Video Music_ Awards show. Clearly, ,

the United States has made some progress:

K But how much? _ ‘

Throughout The Pitt News’ sixth annual
Sex Edition, you’ll read stories about how
the Internet has liberated many people

 whose sexual desires were previously op-
 pressed by.socially constructed standards
 for what is considered‘ inappropriate. In
 «fact, the "changing deﬁnition of what is .
 considered appropriate in sex, fashion and
 the media in society is a common theme -
" I throughout this edition. In the process of
‘ perusing it, you’ll notice a common histori-

, .,~.,e.,  “V ,. A‘. \.;4.,,.,

   
 

  

   if /'   atr.§rt~rauas: W M it gee rat

cal trend: Women asserting themselves as
individuals with desires that should no
longer be kept silent. We also include men’s

perspectives on issues such as spending ‘

on dates andthe lack of birth control op-
tions for men.

This edition, however, isn’t conﬁned Z

to commentary on the physical act of sex.
Our writers have also written about the
changing nature of relationships, includ-
ing how interracial couples still face some
level of scrutiny in the year 2014. Progress

has been made, but it’s clear that ‘we still

haven’t overcome the prejudices of our
nation’s past.

As is the case with any of our daily edi-
tions, we invite readers to submit their own
responses to our articles, regardless of

' whether the feedback is negative or posi-

tive. That is, of course, our goal: Promot-
ing dialogue for a subject that has been
considered taboo for so long.

Two‘ indelible events framejim O’Brien’s

“In 1960, Bill Mazeroski hit the great-
est home run ever, ending game seven

A a freshman. “And in November of1’63,- .

both: the night he met his wife.

Most students have seen the glass-
encased home plate on the first floor
of Posvar Hallwhere Forbes Field once

stood. For the class of 1964, that home
plateis a reminder of the Oakland that
they knew during their years at Pitt.
‘ That was a time when Forbes -Field

were searching for their life partners
amid this social change. '

“At Pitt, girls and guys were looking to ’

Pitt in 1965 with degrees in journalism
and German. ,

Dikkers said thatit was common

basement of the Cathedral of Learning.

English. She said that Mel had access to

Sex sells. And thanks to the Internet, it’s
selling in new ways for new people. . '

_ When Pittsburgh native Howie Gordon
‘was making movies in the late 1970s and
1980s, the market for pornography catered
to straight men’s fantasies of how women
should act. '

Gordon said the male actor’s orgasmwas
usually the culmination of a scene in ﬁlms
in which he acted, while women’s orgasms

' were incidental. Most female actors —— often
poorly -4 faked arousal and orgasms. He
remembered women often rolling their eyes
mechanically and licking their lips in a poor
imitation of actual arousal. .

“It’s an insult to God and nature what

they were calling a female orgasm,” Gor-

don said. ‘ 0
While the market for pornography that
caters to a straight, male audience is still
strong, the Internet has opened up niche
markets that fall outside the traditional por-
-nography audience of straight men. Websites
can reach the market for fetish pornography
‘in a way thattraditional stores and clubs

never did. The Internet has also enabled‘

the rise of an industry of “feminist porn”
that appeals to some politically conscious
female and LGBTQ consumers of adult vid-
eos in a way that straight, more traditional
pornography does not. .

It was only in the 1980s that VCRS be_-
came commonplace in American homes
and made pornography more privately

‘adds variety of sexual preferences

accessible. Although customers could buy A

sexually explicit “loops” of eight—millimeter
ﬁl_m before that time, consumers of pornog-
raphy, who were usually men, frequented
adult movie theaters, according to Mark
Kemes, a senior editor at Adult Video News,
the trade journal for the mainstream adul
entertainment industry. ' V
For obvious reasons, most women --
and men —— avoided these establishments.
Anti—s_odomy laws at the time also made
ﬁlming and distributing gay pornography
’dif‘ﬁcult. Decreased costs of making mov-
ies and increased privacy created a larger
marketfor pornography. I
The advent of the Internet allowed more
non-traditional pornography companies
to thrive. ' _ _
* . Peter Acworth started Kink.com in 1997

u

out of his dorm room at Columbia Business
School, where he was a graduate student
studying ﬁnance. Acworth got the idea af-

ter he read a newspaper story about a ﬁre- '

ﬁghter who was making money by selling
nude pictures on the Internet, according to
an entry he wrote for The Huffington Post’s
blog last year. ‘ V _ .

Kink.com has grown from Acworth’s per-
sonal project into the largest purveyor of

. BDSM — bondage, domiriation, submission ’

and masochism — and other fetish-themed
or “kinky” videos, according to Michael
Stabile, a company spokesman. , ,

.The company’s revenue is now valued
at $30 million, according to the website In-
sideView, which tracks data on companies.

,Kink.com’s ofﬁces occupy a massive for-
mer U.S. Army National Guard armory in San
Francisco. It is the subject of a documentary
title_d “Kink” that actorjames Franco pro—.
duced last year.

“If you were to go into the armory, we’re
constantly shooting,” Stabile said.

Stabile said Kink.com ﬁlms about 1,000
scenes — complete sexual encounters of
about 30 to 50 minutes — a year. Its content
menu reads like a taxonomy chart for sex-

ual fetishes. For example, “slave training,”
“sadism and masochism,” “gay wrestling,”
“bondage,” “rope bondage,” “femdom,”
“public sex,” “gay public sex,” and “women
in bondage” are just someof the tags on
display on the company’s home page.
Stabile said the market for fetish mate-

rial was underserved before the rise of the _

Internet.

Because obscenity laws defer to the stan-
dards of individual communities to deter-
mine what is obscene, many distributors of
porn worried about facing criminal charges
before its_larg.e-scale move to the Internet
because a local prosecutor could ﬁnd the
material offensive, Stabile said.

Acworth wrote in a blog post last year
for The Hufﬁngton Post that while he was
growing up, he felt turned on when he was
watching a cowboy and Indian movie in
which actors were tied up. Later, he learned
bondage turned him" on.

“Anyone with a fetish is likely to ﬁnd con-
tent that appeals to them speciﬁcally and,
thus, feel less isolation, shame or conﬁision,”

Don’t fetishize me,

Jeff Ihaza
Stqff Wrz'ter

If I were to star in a porn ﬁlm, it would prob-
ably, despite my wishes, carry a title similar
to any of these real ﬁlm titles: “Hot Black
Thug,” “Black Poles in White Holes,” “Long
Dong Black Kong,” “Guess Who’s Banging
Your Sister.”

I picture a white porn producer, whose
ﬁrst name is an adjective, suavely telling me
that it’s nothing personal and that it’s abusi-
ness of supply and demand. He’d be right.

In perhaps only one way, porn is wholly
democratic. If the desire for a particular
fetish or “thing” exists, chances are someone

will ﬁnd a way to ‘make a porn movie to suit -

those desires. What happens, though, when
that desire is rooted in the ugliest and most
hurtful of racial stereotypes‘?

When Danielle Allbritain and Jordon
Carstarphen indulged in a dinner-and-
a—movie date, they didn’t expect fel-
low diners to leave in outrage at their
presence.

Allbritain, who’s a white senior ma=
joring in biology at Pitt‘, was out with
her boyfriend, Carstarphen, a black
member of the U.S. Army, when he
kissed her across the table in the res-
taurant. An elderly white couple nearby,
Carstarphen said, did not approve of
their liplock. ' .

“They just kept getting more and
more disgusted,” Carstarphen said.
“And they left.”

Though it’s the 21st century, cou-
ples at Pitt have experienced a similar
situation, facing tough reactions about
race from family, friends or strangers.
While Allbritain and Carstarphen‘-said
they don’t often experience negativ-
ity, both agreed that couples who are
of the same race are treated better by
most of society. I

price will go down if she ever f*ck a black
guy,” he raps.

It remains one of West’s most poignant
jabs at a huge problem in contemporary
American culture: the overall acceptance
of fetishized racial stereotypes. ‘

The torrid history of the sexual dehuman-
ization of African-Americans has its roots
in the antebellum South, where black men
and women were believed to have animal-
istic sexual habits. Society was structured
around the power of white men, making
black women an object of experimentation
and black men a threat to the sexual purity
of white women.

’ , Minstrel shows depicted sex-crazed
black men marauding the countryside in
search for white women who were supposed

to be irresistible to them. The idea that my ‘

ancestors possessed an insatiable lust for
white women never underwent any scru-
tiny, and despite being rooted in America’s
less-than-decent past ideologies, remains

’ a pervasive (and disgusting) belief in con-

Interracial couples gaining a

Allbritain said her family dished out
some tough opinions about her rela-
tionship at first. .

“The first time he met my parents,
it was very awkward because he knew
my parents weren’t for it,” she said.
“I dated someone of color before him
and my parents didn’t like that, either.”

Allbritain and Carstarphen have

temporary culture. _
Similarly, black women continue to suffer
a doubly invective marginalization as their

_ human capital, still gauged by their sexual

expedience, somehow remains tied to the
early perception of them as “wild rides” for
slave owners. _

When Don Imus,-who is currently on Fox
Business TV, calleda group of women on
the Rut;gers.basketball team “nappy headed
hos” in 2007, the easy reaction to the media

outcry would have been to say we were a _

newly progressive society on the cusp of its
ﬁrst non-white president.

' Unfortunately, in the dark, dank bed-
rooms of America, a porn ﬁlm with the title

“Nappy Headed Hos” became immensely

popular. , . . .
In her book “Unequal Desires,” Siobhan
Brooks points to the drastically lower wages
black strippers make in comparison to their
white counterparts. She discusses at length
the lower erotic capital of black women in-
the sex economy as being reﬂective of their

cceptance, still

dated people of the same and differ-
ent races from themselves, but both saw
resistance from their families;

A member of Carstarphen’s extended
family disapproved of his relationship
with Allbritain. ‘

“Her exact words were ‘If she can’t
use a comb, don’t bring her home,”’
Carstarphen said.

According to a Pew Research Center

report, slightly more than 15 percent of
‘ new marriages in 2010 in the United

States were between spouses‘ of dif-
ferent races. ‘

‘ U.S. Census data shows that ‘interra-
cial marriages started increasing after
the’1967 Supreme Court case Loving v.
Virginia, which made racial discrimina-
tion in marriage illegal: The couple in-
volved in the case, Mildred and Richard
Loving, a black woman and whiteman,
went to jail for one year after getting
married. The day the Supreme Court
decision was announced, June 12, is
celebrated each year as"“Loving Day.”

Interracial marriages have been a
rising annual trend according to U.S.

Census Bureau statistics, and a recent #3

Even in college, financial disparities can strain relationships. Bobby Mizia |Visual Editor

Cristina Holtzer
Staff Wrz'ter

While many college dates no longer end

g_ with men picking upthe check, it doesn’t
’ ~ matter who’s expected to pay if everyone’s
l lbroke. -A ~ ‘ ‘

According to analysis of the U.S. Census

A Bureau’s latest American Community Sur-
vey, women under the age of 30 living in

large citiesare making more money than
men their age. As more women graduate
with college degrees, fewer and fewer of
them are relegated to being the secondary
earner in their relationships. _

‘ “We might be in a time where there are
rapidly changing dynamics between men

and women,” Stephanie McCracken, rela-

tionship coach and therapist for Pittsburgh

Psychotherapy Associates, said.

For college students who don’t yet have »

degrees or full—time jobs, there’s generally
little money to spare, regardless of gender.
, While most college students work jobs
aroundithe same pay grade, McCracken
said that it’s not just the stude‘nts"‘own
incomes that affect the dynamics of rela-
tionships, but familial income levels, as
well. The amount that a student’s family
contributes to supporting them can create
large disparitiesbetween students.
“Even if [students_are] not working,

they might receive some assistance from

their families,” McCracken«said.

Students, professors question authenticity of ‘real beauty’ 1 phenomenon

Taira Alabi
F or The Pitt News

Julianne Whaley respects thatjennifer Law-

rence stays true to her identity as well as her
positive image. . '

“That’s really hard to do in that industry,”

J Whaley, an undeclared junior, said.

Whaley is not alone in her positiveview of
celebrities such as Lawrence, and her opinion
aligns with a nationwide trend that embraces
the concept ofbeing normal as a new form of
beauty. In recent months, popular media and
celebrities have circulated ad campaigns, pho-
tos and other messages, in which normality
trumps the over-glamorized trendsiof the past.

Since her starring role inthe 2012 box of-
ﬁce hit “The Hunger Games,” Lawrence has
become America’s sweetheart. Her ofﬁcial
Facebookfan page currently has more than 5.7
million likes, and shehas been featured on the
cover of magazines such as Vogue, Glamour,
InStyle and Seventeen. _

Like Whaley, people ﬁnd Lawrence’s seem-

ingly normal qualities to be what makes her '

so lovable.

Lawrence famously. fell on stage as she
walked to receive her Oscar award in February
2013 and has discussed her acne and “stomach
rolls” in her interviews with the press.

“I just really respectthat she is holdingtrue
to her own identity,” Whaley said. -

While supporters ﬁnd Lawrence’s normal
qualiﬁes refreshing,’ not everyone holds the
same opinion. -

Frayda Cohen, an anthropology and wom-
en’s studies professor at Pitt, said Lawrence’s

fame automatically differentiates her from the L

average person. s ’

- ~ “Celebrities likejennifer Lawrence might

look very normal and acceptable, but in reality,
they still have a wide variety of fashion and
makeup choices that most people don’t have
access to,” Cohen said.

Lawrence is just one player in the rising
obsession  “real beauty.”

The use _of the hashtag “noﬁlter,” which
refers to the lack of a photo ﬁlter on a photo,
has become increasingly popular on social
networks. v

Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Miley.

use the hashtag on Twitter and Instagram to
show followers what they look like without
photo retouching. '

McCord, an American actress known for
her appearance on 90210, surprised herfans
in May 2012 when she tweeted a picture that
showed her acne.

With a rising interest in realistic beauty,
many companies have. capitalized on the
phenomenon. ' ' .

Aerie, the female apparel and lingerie
manufacturer, announced last month that
the companyywill stop» airbrushing photos
of models and feature more diverse ‘models
in ad campaigns. In 2004, Dove launched its
Campaign for Real Beauty, which included
women of diverse races, sizes and‘ ages. C

Cohen said the companies are often “trying
to use the artiﬁcial as away making the natural

seem really natural.”

“But it’s not natural,” she said. “It’s still

artiﬁcial and just looks like a more perfect

version of the natural.”

Cohen also mentioned that even when so-
ciety thinks of people as normal, it might still
be thinking of a “white, skinny and blonde”

 

any purchase of $30 or more‘

standard of beauty.

“If you walked into an engineering class
here at Pitt, you actually would see a much
broader range of people, body types and ideals
of beauty and dress than you would ever see
in one of these ads,” Cohen said. ‘

One of the most viral advertisements re-
leased during Dove’s Real Beauty Campaign in
April 2013 was the Real Beauty Sketches video.

The ad features various women describing
to an artist how they perceive their appear-
ances, while the artist sits on another side of a
curtain and draws the women speaking based
solely on that woman’s description of herself.

After the artist completed the  draw-
ings, strangers who saw the other women
before the exercise then describe to the artist

_ how theythink each woman looks‘. The artist

draws the same person again, but this time
based on the strangers’ description, which
always resulted in a much more attractive
drawing.

The ad aimed to show that people are more ‘

THE’ ELLICITOR

Success in marketfor fetish objects an elusive undertaking

Ellie Petrosky
Assistant Opinions Editor

The advent of the Internet has made shar-
ing information inﬁnitely easier. Among
the information shared is knowledge of
different fetishes and sexual preferences.

With the increased knowledge of fetish-
es has come an online market for the buying
and selling of fetish objects. Items such as
used underwear, pictures of feet and used
personal items are sold at prices upwards
of $20 per item. With such a wide variety
of fetishes publicized, it’s easy to assume
that almost anyone could ﬁnd success in
this market and make a little extra money
on the side. I am here to tell you this is not
the case.

To be successﬁal in the sex industry, you
have to know how to market yourself and
who your target audience is. You have to
anticipate what people are going to want.
You can’t get discouraged when you don’t

wcckrml out in l’itl~.«lun‘g,l1 but

get a response to your well-thought-out ad_-
vertisement and most of all, you have to do
research and ﬁgure out the best method of
performing your service. Working in the sex
industry takes time and careﬁil planning.
How do I know all this, you might ask?
In the name of extra spending money and
genuine curiosity, I put myselfon the inside
and tried my hand at selling fetish objects.
To make mys elf clear, I did not prostitute
myself or sell my body, degrade myself in
any way or participate in any illegal activity.
I tried to sell my used and worn underwear.
I was so excited as I rushed home from
class. I had posted my ﬁrst underwear ad
online that morning. I was hoping to open
up my account and see a private message
waiting for me from someone willing to
buy what I was offering. In the moment it
took for the webpage to load, all my hopes
of becoming a successful underwear seller
were dashed ,— I didn’t have a single mes-
sage, comment or view on my ad. In that

moment, I realized working in a sex—focused
industry was a lot harder than it seemed,
and that it was, indeed, actual work.

I had decided to post the ad in question
on the website Reddit. For those of you un-
familiar with it, Reddit is one big site made
up of thousands of tiny, specialized pages
called subreddits, each devoted to a differ-
ent topic. I happened to discoverthere was
a subreddit focused on connecting buyers
and sellers of used underwear. Bingo — I
had found my platform. In order to erase
any outside factors that might have come
into play while attempting to sell under-
wear, I made a fresh account just for the
occasion. ' ‘

The subreddit was my go—to place for
almost all of my research. I closely studied
the FAQs and posts focused on how to get
started, taking note of tips such as the fact
that PayPal was unreliable and the sug-
gestion to be absolutely clear in describ-
ing what I was selling. I paid attention to

how other sellers marketed their wares and
titled their posts, hoping I could emulate
their successes.

All the preliminary work setting up
different accounts and ensuringl actually
knew what I was doing took a few days to
complete, and then all that was left was
posting the ad. I had gone out earlier that
week and bought several pairs of cheap
underwear for this experiment. The trick

nowwas advertising them tastefully, which ‘

proved difﬁcult in a task that was surround-
ed by sex and sensuality. I added an eye-
catching title to the ad, clicked submit and
I was ﬁnally on the market.

In all honesty, after reading up a bit on
underwear selling, it seemed like a super
easy way to make some quick cash. I wear
underwear every day, so it wouldn’t actually
be too much work. How hard could it be to

take a picture of my underwear and post an

Female sexuality a

Julia Carpey
Columnist

As a self—proclaimed third—wave feminist,
I often ﬁnd myself caught between the two
extremes of the‘ feminist movement as it
pertains to sex, not particularly ﬁtting in
either section. A .
In the case of college campuses, I’m not
the type of woman who feminists would peg
as someone who is piningfor a relationship,
who came to‘ college for'her “Mrs.” degree
and goes out on the prowl every weekend,
thinking asll embark on each drunken ad-
venture: “Tonight’s the night — the night I’m
going to ﬁnd my boyfriend?’ I mock those
girls. I scoff at their mindsets, although I
applaud their unwavering determination. I

‘ feel sorry for their jaded perceptions, lack

of liberation and eagerness to have their

. se1f—worth deﬁned by another human being.

On the other hand, I don’t deﬁne myself
in the other group: a group stereotypically
categorized by the aversion to or “fear” of

relationships, the group whose weekends
read of promiscuity —— a group labeled as
“sluts.”

Much like we’re facing a culture of femi-
nists who believe that if a woman is a stay-
at—home—mom, setting the work of feminists
generations before her back by 20 years, we

. are facing a similar culture of high—horsed,

shit-talking feminists who believe that there

' are only two subsets of women who interact
with men inlcollege. Some women do not
necessarily want to ‘be in a serious, emotion- _
ally laden relationship, while those same (
women might not necessarily want to sleep -

' with a different guy every weekend. This

middle—group, per se, might just simply
want consistent sex and company void of
ambiguity that comes with a. different per-

‘ son every weekend, and void of1ong—term

commitment. - .

One of the pillars of feminism — and
for that matter, progress — is accepting
everybody’s ability to choose and, by default,
respectingthat choice, regardless of whether

or not we agree with it.

I’m not going to stand on my soapbox
and tell you that slut-shaming is a horrid,
patriarchal, masochistic aspect of society
that’s been here since the dawn of time and
needs to be eradicated. We all know that.

I’m also not going to stand on the neigh-
boring soapbox and tell you that being in a
relationship is a sure—ﬁre way to feel secure
and loved. I’m sure we can all infer this point
or have learned it from experience.

I will, however, stand on my soapbox over
here and proceed to defend the middleman
or rniddlewoman. For years; women in col-
lege have felt silenced by their fears of la-

bels. Either you’re labeled as provocative if

you openly enjoy sex and are not ready to
settle into a relationship, or you’re viewed
as desperate and one-t-rack—mi_nded if you’re
looking for security and an emotional con-
nection. -

This is not to say that sex is completely
void of emotional connections. Biologically,
at least the slightest bit of emotions become

GREAT

complex spectrum not to be dichotomized f

involved in the process of enjoying sex for
everybody. My point is, occasionally you
might not be interested ina relationship in
which emotional connections are just as es-
sential as the sexual connection. Sometimes
you just need to scratch an itch.

Women have been doing this for years -
it’s just not widely discussed over brunch.

~ Our reasons for not entering serious re—v

lationships are as plentiful as any man’s
reasons, yet it’s not only accepted, but ap-
plauded, for men to simply have consistent
sex. Meanwhile, women are patronized and
made to feel shameful for simply liking and
pursuing the same exact thing. ’
‘While various factors come into play as
to why our society views the sexual gender
gap this way, perhaps part of it is because of a
lack of examples openly set for us. As Sandra
Mims Rowe writes in “The Edge of Change,”
the likelihood of the promotion of women in
the workplace depends on “whether there

Female orgasms neglected by
societal understanding of sex

Natalie Russell
_ Columnist

Patriarchy never sleeps -— especiallylin
the bedroom. Men’s rights activists —
and other embarrassments to the male
gender — will tell you that a man’s or-

gasm is naturally more important than a _

woman’s because it’s necessary for pro-
_ creation. I wonder how much they would
respect the ‘‘laws of nature” if women
just decided to stop taking their birth

V control pills.’ . . V

Not only do women take on the major-
ity of negativesexual side-effects 4 such
as unwanted pregnancy, higher risk of
sexually transmitted infections and the
ever-looming fear of "a urinary, tract in-
fection — they also get gypped when it
comes to sexual pleasure. In a patriarchal
world, a woman’s orgasm is secondary, if
not superﬂuous.

' According to a recent" study from re-

searchers at Indiana University’s Center -

for Sexual Health Promotion, a woman’s
orgasm is put on the back burner for

nearly every age group. The study noted A
_ that men were overall signiﬁcantly more

likely to receive oral sex from their female
partners than they were to give it.

In 2010, a team of British researchers
from the University of Central Lancashire
found that 80 percent of heterosexual
women admitted to faking orgasms dur-
ing vaginal intercourse at least half of the
time, and 25 percent faked it 90‘percent
ofthe time. Another study conducted at

‘Temple University found that 60 percent
of women had faked an orgasm» during in-

tercourse or oral sex. So even on the rare '

occasion in which a woman does receive
oral sex, she’s not getting much out of it.

This is the picture of patriarchy: A
woman is not only unconcerned with her
pleasure enough to frequently fake or-
gasms, but doesn’t even want to, burden
her partner with the emasculating reality
that she’s not enjoying it nearly as much
as he thinks she is. Why is sexism relevant
in this instance? (See: slut-shaming, the
purity myth, unrealistic standards for sex

appeal, etc.) These messages don’t exactly

create an encouraging environment for‘

female sexual expression. .
Patriarchy obviously contributes to
the problem of pleasure inequality in a
direct way, but the phenomenon of the
° fake orgasm among women says'a lot
about its indirect inﬂuence, too. When
you look at pop culture, it’s not all that
surprising that sexual pleasure for men is
deemed a top priority across the board.
Even a scan through the magazine rack
in the grocery store checkout conﬁrms
this with women’s magazines that devote
half of their real estate to “pleasing your
rn'an,” while men’s magazines talk about
“more important stuff” like business and
Muscle.Milk.

Beyond pop culture, the medical com-
munity is also notoriously discriminatory
against female sexuality. A. man expe-

riencing sexual dysfunction related to‘

arousal and orgasm has plenty of medici-

nal solutions to which he can turn, since ‘

research in this ﬁeld has been so substan-
tial. Women, alternatively, have access to
sex therapy, but researchers have only
recently begun looking for medicinal so-
lutions for their sexual disorders. What’s
especially interesting about the lack of
research in female sex drive solutions is

V that women experience signiﬁcantly more
problems in this realm. Very few sub-
stantial studies have taken place to ﬁnd
treatments for women in terms of arousal
,and orgasm, despite the fact that both
issues are signiﬁcantly more prevalent

V in women. According to-the Cleveland

Clinic, 43 percent of women experience

sexual dysfunction, compared to 31 per— ’

cent of men. You know how scientiﬁc rac-
ism has been used to oppress minorities
for decades‘? I’m- thinking there’s some
scientiﬁc‘ sexism going on in this area
that we haven’t quite named yet. ,
What if we were to -re-prioritize male
and femalesexuality? I’d suggest a radical
new approach for the scientiﬁc, medical
and pop cultural communities: Women
come first. I ‘ .

r Birth control

for men often
overlooked

Dylan Abbott
Staff PVrz'ter

Contraception is perhaps the least
sexy thing about sex. It’s a silent re-
minder of all those terrifying complex-
ities that we don’t want to be thinking
about when being intimate. But it’s an
essential aspect of re1ationships.that
should never be ignored or brushed
under the bed. A '

When considering monogamous,
heterosexual relationships, women
have often been burdened with re-
sponsibility for f llowing safe-sex
practices while men gleefully sit
back, relieved at the opportunity to
say goodbye to that irritating com-
panion, the condom, under the as-
sumption that they’re participating
in pregnancy risk—free sex. '

This unbalanced responsibility
creates the notion that it’s the woman’s
body that will bear the brunt of an
unplanned pregnancy, and therefore
protection is the woman’s problem.
Arguably, such a d0uble—standard can
be perceived in the noticeable lack of_
options in terms of male contracep-
tives. Ih the so years that female birth
control has been around, why haven’t
reliable forms of male contraceptives
become available?

According to the Planned Parent-
hood website, there are currently ﬁve
forms of birth control for men. Besides
the condom, these methods include.
withdrawal, abstinence, outercourse
and vasectomy '

Withdrawal, also known as pull-
ing out, has already been dismissed
as a v_e1y risky and unreliable form of

For The Pitt News

 

Mikayla Ferchaw, a freshman" engi-

, T g __ _A i .v V 4 neering major, started using birth
. V ' 2 l . . .. . control pills last March. Since then,
V shehas been on ﬁve different pills.

“I just feel like I should try every
option out there,” Ferchaw said.

Now that she is in college, Ferchaw,
who originally took the pill to help
clear her skin and prevent pregnancy,
favors .the pill as a safety precaution
just in case. , . g

Women have many options to
choose from when it’ comes to birth

In some cases, medication isn’t the
only solution to prevent pregnancy.

Leslie Heyer, the founder and
president of Cycle Technologies, said
Cyclebeads —— a planning method
that helps women track their fertil-
ity cycles —— provides three different
options for women to choose from: a
smartphone app, an online tracker or‘
a color-coded string of beads.

With Cyclebeads, women can track
which days they could or could not
become pregnant after intercourse
and make informedldecisions on when .
to have intercourse.

Cyclebeads utilizes the Standard
Days Method, which allows women to
know when they are potentially fertile

course load. After rent, bills and gas mon-
ey, she said she feels like she barely has
any cash to spend on going out with her
boyfriend, Sam Negley. Negley, a senior
architectural studies major at Pitt, has a
partial scholarship for running track, so
he doesn’t have to work.

“I wouldn’t say that I have resentment
towards him,” Adams said. “I’m happy
that he is well off  but I do get annoyed
whenever I have to go to work and he can
stay home and do whatever he wants, but

out of the fact that I’m jealous I can’t do i

the same.”

Adams, who has been dating Negley for
about four months, said that, as a woman,
she usually expects men to pay for dates
up to a certain point, but when things start
to get more serious she’s used to splitting
the date expenses. So far, money hasn’t
negatively impacted their relationship,
she said. ‘

“We don’t really ever ﬁght about it,”
Adams said. “But I do express that I am

jealous that he ,doesn’t’have to work for
‘money andthat he is lucky.”

One of the "biggest challenges for
couples is the division of resources’, Mc— ,
Cracken said. " j

“People with access to lots of resources
often feel a burden of guilt,” McCracken
said, “and those who have little access
feel ashamed and at fault for their own
ﬁnancial state.”

Rachel Dudle, a junior economics and
business major at Pitt, andjher boyfriend
Connor Gieger, a junior geology major,

‘both bring money to their relationship in

different ways. Between all of theirischool
obligations, they are looking for an apart-
ment to share next year. ‘
“We don’t have enough time for'it to
become a money issue,” Gieger said. L
Gieger is a Pitt resident assistant and
Dudle works as a paid intern at Janney
Montgomery Scott, a ﬁnancial service ﬁrm
Downtown. While Dudle‘ has more money
to spend right now, she said she thinks of
them as being equal because Gieger won’t
have as many student loans to pay off after
college. - . ‘

now] ,” Dudle said of Gieger. “But we try to
see each other at least once a day.” '

The ﬁnancial strain of student life
doesn’t allow for very extravagant dates,
and Gieger and Dudle said they’re ﬁne with
meeting up at Market Central between
classes for dinner, or just watching Netﬂix
when they’re both too burned out to study
any more.

During the summer, when Gieger usu-
ally works a part-time job, he said he has
more money to spend on activities with
Dudle. Both said they usually agree to do
cheaper activitieslor to avoid spending A
money at all. '

“Don’t make it so that you can only hang
out whenever you have to spend money to
do things,” Gieger said. “You could blow
through a lot of money that way.”

. . But though there are ways to work’
around ﬁnancial differences in college,
McCracken noted that the complications
money brings to a relationship won’t go -
away anytime soon. '

“I think ﬁnances play a role at every age
and every level,” McCracken said. “Couples ’

at the university level might just be starting V ~

to notice those differences.” I ‘

released its ﬁrst material on DVD in 2005,
but now publishes material exclusively for
online subscribers. She said her company
faces less overhead this way.

“We don’t'have to deal with other dis-
tributors,” Houston said. ,

Larissa Brian, a doctoral candidate in
Pitt’s communications department, said
feminist porn represents a departure from
mainstream pornography, which shows sex
as “shiny, stylized and sanitized.”

“Feminist porn doesn’t try to gloss over ’

things in the sense that it shows sex as a
messy, untidy and playful process,” Brian
said. “It shows bodies as theyare.”

Brian described the dialogue in ‘main-
stream adult ﬁlms as more scripted and less

- authentic than in ﬁlms produced by altema-

tive companies such as Kink.com and Pink
and White Productions. She said this format
leads men to regard consent from women as
automatic, rather than something they need
to explicitly ask for. y
'Mainstream adult ﬁlms have generated
criticism from feminists for decades.
Activist and lawyer Catharine MacKin-
non claimed in a 1985 article published in
Harvard Law Review that porn eroticizes
inequality between men and women, cre-
ating the illusion that women want to “be
taken and violated.” .
“Pornography codes how to look at wom-
en, so you know what you can do with one
when you see one,” MacKinno‘n said. “Por-
nography deﬁnes women by how we look,
according to how we can be sexually used.”
Houston described her videos as a more
honest depiction of sexuality than that of
mainstream porn. People who appear in
her ﬁlms decide beforehand what they want
to do. ‘ V
“It’s all about the models,” she said.
“We’re only directing the camera angle. We’re
not directing the models.”
Brian also described Kink.com’s ap-
proach to sexuality as healthier than that

of traditional porn. . "

Films on Kink.com show models givin
their consent to participate in the sex acts in
dialogue before the scene and discuss their
boundaries beforehand.

“It’s called a yes-no—maybe list,” Brian
said. “There’s a clear articulation of what
the woman wants to do, what she doesn’t
want to do and what she might wantlto do.
That’s something you never see. in main-
stream porn.”

She said she thought mainstream adult
ﬁlms show men receiving pleasure much
more than women, and said this dynamic re-

inforces men’s expectations in relationships.

Brian said these more traditional mov-
ies generally follow a standard format of
foreplay, intercourse and “money shot,” or
male orgasm.

Some people in the mainstream adult-
ﬁlm business have moved away from this
format. Candida Royalle, aformer adult-ﬁlm
star, founded Femme Productions in 1984
to “give adult movies a woman’s voice and
something couples could View together,”

according to the company’s website. The

website also says the ﬁlms lack the ‘“money
shot,’ a staple of most adult ﬁlms.”
While Brian saw traditional pornography

as reinforcing men’s lax attitudes toward
- consent, Kernes disagreed. He called charac-

terizations such as Brian’s and MacKinnon’s
“nonsense.” : '

He said that while he had no problem
with companies outside of the mainstream
industry making videos.without scripts or
talking about sex acts before hand, “that’s
not the only way to make a video.” _

Kernes said adult-ﬁlm companies take
pains to avoid looking as if the sex in their
videos isn’t consensual. ,

Legally, Kernes added, adult-ﬁlm com-
panies could not make movies without the
express consent of participants. a -

T Like any other industry, «adult-ﬁlm com-
panies are closely regulated by federal and
state laws. Under federal law, companies
that produce materials that contain sexu-
ally explicit conduct must maintain records
of performers’ real and stage names, dates
of birth and copies of their identiﬁcation.

According to federal law, these regula-
tions also apply to those who digitize images
or upload them onto awebsite.

“If [someone] is having sex on, camera,
they’re getting paid,” Kernes said, referring
to adult videos produced by legitimate com-

‘ panies. “They’re giving consent.”

While Gordon admitted there’s plenty of
misogyny in mainstream adult ﬁlms, he said
it’s a mistake to blame pornography for this
attitude. Instead of teaching men to obj ectify.
women, porn must reﬂect something about
society’s underlying mentality.

The unbalanced dynamics between men
and womenor lack of concern about genuine
female desire must appeal to the fantasies
of the mostly male audience. Gordon said
pomographywas catering to those fantasies
rather than creating them, and disagreed
that these depictions reinforced or encour-
aged violence against women. .

“The question is, are people going to 100
at this and think, ‘That’s how I’m supposed
to behave?”’ Gordon said. “If that’s true,
then we have a real problem with our sex
education.” I A

CONTROL

contraception, as its effectiveness is
based on acute timing and self-restraint.

Meanwhile, abstinence and outer-
course completely disregard penetra-
tive sex — of course avoidance is the
“best” tactic, but it also defeats the point
of contraception — and vasectomy--a
surgical procedure for male steriliza-
tion-- can seem a little too permanent
for some people’s tastes.

_ V-Yet there is a glimmer of hope on_th_e -
scientiﬁc horizon..Toward the end of .

last year, there was a hubbub of media

speculation concerningresearchthat ~

i_s close todeveloping an elusive male
contraceptive pill. I I V ; ‘
Although still in the developmental
process —— and yet to undergo ‘human tri-
als i— scientists in Melbourne, Australia,
are optimisticthat, having uncovered a

. way of blocking proteins thatcontrol the ’

movement of sperm, they can develop

a pill that can essentially allow men to

produce sperm—free semen. ‘
h In an interview with London news-

V, paper ,The“0bserver, head researcher

Sabatino Ventura explained how the

pill worksbystating that if the -semen

were an airplane and the sperm were
the passengers, the pill prohibits the

 . passengers getting on the plane.

There are, in fact, a number of al-
ternative male birth control methods
currently in the pipeline —— all of which

v are -non-hormonal — but they have re— -

ceived little media coverage and even
less funding.
One male contraceptive is Vasalgel,

. whi‘ch’in essence is a temporary vasec-

tomy. In layman’s terms, Vasalgel is a
polymer thatis injected into thevas def-
eren-sj(the tube spiermprassés through
from the testes) -andrenders any sperm
that passes through it sterile.

What’s more, according to the Male
Contraception Information Project
(newmalecontraception.org), it can’
simply be washed out in order to re-
establish normal potency. .

Inspiredgby a product of the same
nature called RISUG (“Reversible'inhibi-
tion of sperm under guidance”) that has
already gone to human trials in India

and proven successful, Vasalgel lacks the
. required funding to advance to animal

trials here in the U.,S. Though if money
can be acquired, it is expected to be on
the market as soon as 2016. _
Another interesting alternative is_the
pithily dubbed “dry-orgasm” or “clean-
sheets” pill. Though at first_this sounds

E a little unsavory, when you take into '
' account that this could not only be an‘
L effective contraceptive device but also a

means of severelyreducing the chances
of HIV transmission, it’s a wonder why
this hasn’t.attracted'more attention ——

_especial1y'.when you consider the poten-

tial_beneﬁts such aproduct could have in
impoverished countries suffering from
unmanageable population growth and-
devastating rates of AID_s. .
What ther“dry orgasm” pill hypotheti-
cally promises is all the same feelings of
an orgasm, but without the mess. This
is achieved through the consumption
of chemicals — originally used as an

-ineffective prescription to help‘ battle

schizophrenia —— that. affects blood
pressure, consequently preventing the
muscles along the urethra from con-
tracting and, therefore, not allowing
semen to pass. ' "

However, this drastic alteration to
what many men consider an important

aspect-ofsexual intercourse might turn .

off a lot of potential customers. L
Elaine Lissner, Director of the Male
Contraception Information Project,

~ provided a persuasive counterargument.

to such preconceptions in a New York
Times article last month. She wrote:

“[Men] are already using the only two
contraceptives they have — condoms ‘

and vasectomy — in great numbers.
At least in the United States, the idea

that men aren’t willing to participate is - ~

clearly out'of date.”- '

Professor Lisa Parker, a member of
the faculty at Pitt’s Center for Bioethics_
and Health Law, shared'Lissner’s senti-
ment. l *

.“I do think that more men will be
willing to'be involved than what_ may I

beexpected,” she said. However, Parker
went on to suggest that, “There maybe
other barriers,‘ such as men concerned
aboutlowering their sperm count.” '1
Parker continued to outline some of

"the social ramiﬁcations of such bodily

Control‘ D '17

alterations.
“‘[It is] as though it would be lower-
ingtheir virility or their manliness in

;

some ways, as we hear about men be-

ing relieved about their sperm count’ as
tho'ugh_it were a point of pride.”
Clearly then, societal norms of mas-

culinity may have proven obstructive in -

the pursuit of balanced and non-gender-
biasedbirth control. ’

Lissa Wettick, a physician at Pitt’s

Wellness Center, provided further indi-
cation as to why this has remained a fe-
male-based concern: “The focus has been
on females because women are the ones
in most.societies who bear the greater
burden [of ]_ an" unplanned pregnancy.”
This is a perception that places men in
a position of privilege. If the belief stands

that an unplanned pregnancy is viewed .
as the woman’s burden, then an effort to‘ _

transfer someof that burden — through
development of contraceptive options
for men —— will be harder to enact. "

_ When asked whether she believed
male contraceptives had a place in

contemporary society, Wettick said, “I _

believe that, as with many topics sur-
rounding sexuality and contraception,

- this depends on the individual either

independently or as part of a couple
making these very personal decisions
with adequate guidance from health care
providers.”

However, as long as_ health care pro-
viders are unable to supply any form of
male contraceptives, due to policymak-
ers and funders believing men areun-
willing to_share the responsibility, most

cQuple’s decisions will remain the same.

' Marian Vanek, director of Pitt’s Well-

‘ ness Center, explained what options are
currently available for Pitt students: '
. “The Student Health Service offers ‘sev-

‘eral forms of contraception, the most
popular being various types of oral con-
traception. And for the convenience of

the students, the prescriptions can be‘

filled inour University pharmacy.”
The provision of more options is re-

quired in order to alter the current per-

ceptions of the weight of responsibility.

ing. They can really have a more "even
discussion as to who willtake responsi-

' bility for this [and] who will alter their

body to avoid pregnancy,” Parker said.

An “even discussion” would definitely
be a step in the right direction to read-
dress the current unbalanced state of
birth control. Consequently, this may
even lead to more equal perceptions of
sexuality and gender, overall.

What’s more, it would be far more
logical for both parties to have the

greater peace of mind. Parker added that
“having some additional methods avail-

able to men, as well as women, would be

very useful.”

Men need to demonstrate that they ‘

are willing to be actively involved with
contraception and that we live in an era
where t_he responsibility of birth control
should be shared. With students un-
doubtedly taking up a very large portion

of the contraceptives market, perhaps -

this is where the change can take place.

Cohen said consumers need to think care-

fully about these issues and added that con-

sumers can be more critical when viewing
advertisements. V
“The combination of education, social ac-
tivism and cautious consumerism is absolutely
essential,” she said. ‘
’ For Mancuso, seeing people unlike herself
portiayedinpopular media isn’t anything new.
Mancuso, who is alesbian, noted that as

. normal as people such as Lawrence appear to
‘be, Lawrence will never ﬁt the normal mold

for every person. ‘ V‘ "
“Tryingto ﬁnd normal is impossible. They
should just try to ﬁnd a bunch of differences,

show those differences and how they are all .
I equal,” Mancuso said. .“We should have people

of color, gay people, trans people and heavy-
set people and put them all together and show
that they are all equal.”

Mancuso added that role models should
exist outside the mass—media spectrum.

“It is so much more rewarding to ﬁnd
people outside of mainstream media who
are positive role models. It’s harder, but it’s

worth it,” she said. ,
' The obsession with beauty also impacts
‘ men, Cohen said, adding that a narrow stan-
dard ofbeauty drives men to search for sexual
partners who reﬂect the ideal.

And as generations pass, the standards of
beauty change, too.  A

“One hundred years ago, there would hav
been awhole slew of things that were different
about the way we view beauty. They would
have not have been as thin, and women would
h.ave never had short hair,” Cohen said.

Mancuso echoed this sentiment.

“I was in a class, and almost every girl in
it said they would not be comfortable dating
someone shorter than them, yet they could

— not explain why,” Mancuso said. _

Whaley added that she has also found peo-
ple attractive simply because they resembled
people she had seen in media. .

‘-‘I used to like people who looked similar
to the guys in One‘ Direction,” Whaley said.

Despite the controversy surrounding
beauty and body image, Whaley still believes
that shiftingperceptions is an attainable feat.

“I dd think that it can change with our
generation if we teach our kids what it really
means to be beautiful,” she said. If

RACE

the most sought-after demographic in por-
nography, fare the best in online dating, while

‘ black women and Asian men, both of whom

have little capital in porn, fare the worst.

' More disturbing are the statistics about
youth exposure to pornography. It’s estimat-
ed by the Young Minds, a British -nonproﬁt
organization that promotes mental health for
young people, that half of 15-17 year olds and

‘a third of 11-14 year olds have been exposed to

pornography. With the advent of tablets and
smartphones in the industry, pom’s ubiquity
in the formation of a collective sexual con-
sciousness is only beginning, so the statistics
about our collective dating habits likely have a
genesis in ﬁlms such as “Oriental Goddesses.”

Finally, it’s not hard to find an anecdote on
college campuses. How many times have we
heard sexual descriptors focused centrally on
race: “I ﬁnally had sex with an Asian chick,”
or “I went black and never went back.” It’s
easy to view our generation, the kids that
elected Obama, as impervious to the ills of
our parents, but how sure are we? I

as°the most fertile days for pregnancy..

A 2001 study by the Institute for Re-
productive Health at Georgetown Uni-
versity developed the Standard Days

Method, and the study calls the method i
“ a “fertilityawareness-based method of

family planning in which users avoid
unprotected intercourse during cycle
Days 8 through 19.” “ '

Even Heyer was initially skeptical. .

“When I first started, I had the same
misconceptions [about the research] as
everyone else, thinking it wouldn’t be as
effective,” Heyer said. ‘

But Heyer now praises the Standard
Days Method as a “simple, natural, effec-
tive family planning tool” and wonders
why more women don’t use it.

. Joanne Oleck, a physician at_ UPMC

Mercy Hospital, said she‘isn’t quick to
choose one birth control method over
another. ” “

“It’s important to tailor the type of ‘

contraceptive to the body, depending on

what the woman prefers,” says Oleck.
According to Oleck, the pill is the

most commonly used form of contra-

ception since its uses extend beyond.

pregnancy prevention, including relief

, from menstrual cramps, heavy and un-

comfortable menstrual cycles and acne.

While Ferchaw said she has never
experienced any side effects from using
the pill, in rare cases, Oleck said the
hormones ingested can cause painful
headaches, mood swings or restlessness.

These hormones are the reason some
women such as Heyer switch to natural
methods.

Otherwomen dislike the_pill because
” ‘it can fail, or decrease in effectiveness, if
V it is not taken every day at the same time.

Oleck said she’s noticed most women

want a birth control method that is easy,‘

and remembering to take a pill every day
can be “challenging. °

As a result, some women explore
other options. . ‘

The NuvaRing ——'a ring inserted
into the vagina that allows hormones

. to be absorbed into the body — is just‘

as statistically effective as the pill, but
only has to be changed once a month.

Additionally, women can receive injec-
tions of hormones every three months
to prevent pregnancy. ‘ .

Some women are hesitant to use these
methods because they are not easily re-
versible. -

According to Oleck, “things go back
to normal in a relatively short period of
time with the pill,” but can take much
longer with other methods.

Some methods — such as intrauter-
ine devices —‘ are even more permanent
than rings or injections because the de-
vices remain inserted in the uterus for
between five and 10 years. These devices
can completely stop menstrual cycles
during the period of usage.

Surgical procedures can implant 4

capsules of hormones that last for sev-
eral years until a later surgery removes
them.‘ .

Oleck said the pill, the Nuva Ring,
hormone injections and intrauterine
devices are e 99 percent effective and
have some rare side effects. _ _

~‘ Throughout her 20-year career in gy-
necology, Oleck said she’s seen only two _
intrauterine devices become dislodged,
and only a handful become infected._

Similarly, she has rarely seen blood clots l

or other bleeding difficulties arise fro
birth control of any form. ' ‘
Oleck has found that most women
are satisﬁed with — and rarely switch
—— their choices in birthcontrol meth-
ods. Switches do occur because of the

differing costs of birth control pills and "'

insurance coverage.

Pills often range from less than $10 to
more than $30 a month, deperiding on
the brand and the insurance company.

Although Ferchaw has been on ﬁve
different pills, she said she switched
because of side effects rather than cost,

and she has found each pill to be. rela- '

tively the same.

Compatibility is the ultimate deter-
minant in birth control methods, ac-
cording to Oleck, who has worked with ,
women who prefer a wide range of con-

dent and that they would often spend
time in an unoccupied music room.

“He would play the piano,” Dikkers
said. “And it was a great opportunity
for us to be alone and get to know each
other.”

O’Brien, who lives in Pittsburgh, grad-
uated in 1964 with a degree in writing

. and went on to write 25 books, including

his most recent, “Chuck Noll: a Winning
Way.” He met his wife, Kathleen Church-
man, at a party for The Pitt News staff.
“A lot of guys and gals met their mates
on The Pitt News staff,” said O’Brien,
who wrote for The Pitt News, though he
added that many guys, especially those
in search of intelligent women, would
search for their soul mates at the library.

Jim Grossman graduated from Pitt T

in 1964 and knew O’Brien from their
days at Taylor Allderdice High School in
Pittsburgh. According to Grossman, 71,
who now lives in New York City, the Tuck
Shop was the pinnacle of the Pitt social
scene during the daytime. Fraternities
and other groups would set up booths,
and students often fell into cliques there,
with rival factions forming based upon
where a student was from.

“Pitt in the early ’6os was in a tran- _

sition from being a commuter school,”
Grossman said, adding that this led to
some tension andthat the rivalry be-
tween students from Pittsburgh and
those from Long Island, N.Y., caused

According to Grossman, who gradu-
ated from Pitt in 1964 with a bachelor’s
degree in political science, the sexual
and social revolution that he would wit-

hadn’t quite happened yet.

“The social norms were more tradi-

To illustrate his point, he recalled an
evening when he, a friend and their dates
attended a fraternity party at which a
comedian was performing. According
to Grossman, the comedian shocked the
crowd by using “the ‘F’,curse.”

“We were appalled’; because that was
totally unacceptable at the time,” Gross-

man said, adding that perhaps he and
his friends had used that word on rare
occasion but would never use it among
women. 4

“It was so offensive, we went out and
had a discussion about it,” Grossman
said. .

Marilyn Dikkers agreed that 1964 was
still a very culturally conservative time,
something that she didn’t notice until
she moved to Paris after she and Mel
Dikkers graduated. She pointed out that,
in keeping with her values, she lived in .
an apartment of her own in Paris until
she and Mel got married.

“It all started" at Pitt,” Dikkers said,

fast and a black husband and a mixed '

kid,” Allbritain said. “And it’s just like a
family together. It’s good foryour heart.
I love that commercial. I literally had a
tear come down my face.”

White Americans are the least likely to
marry outside of their race, and Native
Americans are the most likely to marry
outside of their race, according to the
2010 U.S. Census Bureau study.

Clare Zupan, a Native American ju-
nior majoring in psychology at Chathain
University, is dating a white woman, and
said most people don’t seem to notice
their different races. -

“My family will joke with me that I’m
dating a white girl,” Zupan said of her
girlfriend, Liz, who asked to withhold

her last name. “But it’s a big joke, noth-
ing negative. Also, the gay thing is more
distracting than the interracial thing,
you know?” ’

Zupan said she never felt afraid of her
parents’ reactions to whom she might
date and plans to raise her own kids with
the same open-mindedness.

Zupan and Liz, who have beentogeth- ~
er for nearly two-and-a-half years, said
they’ve agreed that if they ever have chil‘- "
dren together, they’d like to use a sperm
donor with.a similar racial makeup to
Zupan if Liz is the biological mother.

Allbritain noted the power of the me-
dia to cultivate a more widespread accep— _
tance of different families in this country
by presenting more diverse families.

“We had so many fights, but my
parents are ﬁne now,” Allbritain said. .
“There’s so many more families that are
becoming mixed.” ﬂi-
