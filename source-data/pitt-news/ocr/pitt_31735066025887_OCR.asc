Clapp Hall evacuated after an explosive discovery

By John Temple
and Matt Serlin
T be Pitt News

Clapp Hall was evacuated
yesterday morning as city
police bomb squad officers
removed a five-year-old con-
tainer of suspected nitroglyc-
erine from a biology depart-

ment laboratory.

A laboratory worker who
was cleaning out a lab refrig-
erator one week ago noticed
and
recalled that a now-deceased
professor had said it was
nitroglycerine, a highly explo-
sive chemical which becomes

Joseph
Steffan’s
military
removal

By Beth Kovaly

News Assistant

Six weeks before grad-
uation Joseph Steffan
was honorably dis-

tary academy he was
attending.

Steffan was discharged
because he is gay and
had admitted it.

“The ongoing struggle
in my own mind was
tearing me apart,”
Steffan said. “What I was
faced with, ultimately,
was a choice between
accepting who I am and
moving on or continuing
down this path of self-
hatred and  ultimately
a path to self-destruc-
tion.” a

Steffan travels to uni-
versities across the
country speaking of his
experiences in the
Annapolis Naval
Academy. The full-time
law student at ,_the
University of
Connecticut spoke at
Carnegie Mellon last
night to a crowd of over
100 students.

He said he is proud to
be part of the struggle to
end discrimination
against gays and les-
bians in the military and
that the future is looking
bright.

“The military is such a
hierarchical institution .
it has been forced in
every instance to change

more unstable over time.

The container, which may
have contained enough nitro-
glycerine to destroy a large
part of the building, had been
stored among other materials
in the back of the refrigerator
for five years.

Laboratory coordinator
Rosemary Boone said she
called Facilities Management
last Tuesday after the worker
told her about the suspected
nitroglycerine.

Facilities Management
investigated the situation
nearly a week before calling
the bomb squad, said Steve
Nehus, Facilities Management

Chemical Safety coordinator.

“We wanted to move slowly
and deliberately and make
sure that we took the proper
actions rather than creating a
bigger hazard or an incident
that we didn’t have to.”

The amount of nitroglycer-
me the container could have
contained “would certainly
take the front of the building
off if detonated,” Nehus said.

Boone said that the profes-
sor had told the worker
before she died that the con-
tainer was full of nitroglycer-
ine. After the professor died
the worker kept forgetting to
do something about the con-

tainer.

“When she’d see it, she’d
remember that we should get
rid of it, but then she’d get
busy and forget about it,”
Boone said.

Boone speculated that the
professor may_have been
using- the nitroglycerine,
which dilates blood vessels,
in experiments involving
blood flow in small organ-
isms.

The bomb squad officers
will examine the container
soon to determine its con-
tents, Nehus said. Campus
police were unavailable for
comment.

Wofford,

lecture

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Pitt students will see a
period of social inven-

tion.
Pennsylvania Senator
Harris Wofford and

Edward J. Perkins, U.S.
ambassador to the
United Nations, spoke at
Pitt’s Stephen Foster
Memorial Auditorium last
night on issues concern-
ing the future of the.
nation and college stu-
dents. _

The lecture, sponsored
by the Graduate School
of Public and
International Affairs, cov-
ered health care and
international affairs.

Wofford said that
health care issues will
change the future of col-
lege students.

“Young people find
themselves locked into a
job because of the health
care provided. They can’t
move around, even if
they want to,” he said.

He said that the
national health care
reform was one of the.
biggest things on
President-elect Bill
Clinton’s agenda.

“Bill Clinton plans to
present, within the first
100 days, a health care
plan,” Wofford said.

Wofford said that in
order to assist Clinton,
he has been working on
health care rights for
people.

The plan focuses on
people as individuals, so
they are not tied down

CMU, Pitt chosen as training sites for Japanese study

By Elizabeth Petras

For the Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
and Carnegie Mellon have
received a $2.6 million grant from
the U.S. Air Force Office of
Scientific Research to train
Americans in the Japanese style
of management of sciences and
technology.

Susie Brown, CM director of

"special projects and planning,

said she hopes that both universi-
ties can combine their strengths
and make this two-year project a
success.

“Pitt offers very good language
and cultural training while CMU
is famous for its technology,”
Brown said. “By combining the
two, we can hopefully find out

why Japan has been doing so
well in the past two to three
decades.”

Pitt and Carnegie Mellon are
one of the four sites nationally
chosen thisyear by the U.S.
Department of Defense to
increase American familiarity with
how the_ Japanese manage sci-
ence and technology. Other par-
ticipating universities include

Stanford and the University of
California at Berkeley.

“The University of Pittsburgh is
proud to join with Carnegie.
Mellon in this nationally impor-
tant effort to better understand
Japanese scientific and engineer-
ing success,” Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor said. “Our

Amnesty International focuses on domestic issues

By Donna Pesansky

- Staff‘ Writer

Amnesty International began its annual
Human Rights Week by shattering the
dominant myth that human rights viola-
tions are absent from the United States.

“Usually Amnesty International looks
at political prisoners in Guatemala, South
America and South Africa, but tonight it’s
important to make people aware that
issues facing America prisoners are bad
and are getting increasingly worse,” Jane
Anderson said in her speech last night
on “Race and the Politics of Justice: The
Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal.”

Anderson is the coordinator of the
Washington-based Quixote Center cam-
paign on “Equal Justice U.S.A.,” which
works to provide human rights in the
U.S. Criminal Justice System.

The United States entered the ‘90s with
more people in jail than anywhere else
in the world and more people of African
descent than anywhere in the world.

Anderson said there are more young
African-American men in jail than in col-

lege, and it is five times more likely for J

an African-American man to be in jail in
the United States than in South Africa.

Anderson defines political prisoners,
or prisoners of conscience (as Amnesty
International terms them), as people
who are victims of racism and the eco-
nomic and political situation in which
they are forced to live.

An example of this injustice was seen
in 1982 when Mumia Abu—Jamal, an
African-American journalist responsible
for covering police misconduct, was con-
victed of killing a Philadelphia police
officer and is now on death row.

“[Abu—Jamal’s] trials were full of injus-

ltices,” Anderson said. “He defended him-

self but was never allowed in the court-
room because he intimidated jurors,
according to the judge.” She said the jury
consisted of 10 white and two African-
Americans, and Abu-Jamal was-only
allotted a total of $150 to make his case. -

And the biggest wrong-doing against
Abu—Jamal was when the prosecuting
attorney mentioned in court that 10
years prior to this incident, Abu-Jamal
was a member of the Black Panther
Party, which was notorious for defend-
ing itself and its neighborhood against
police, Anderson said.

Anderson said this point was brought
up during appeals, but it was still con-
sidered admissible evidence. She noted
a similar case in Delaware where a man
convicted of homicide was affiliated with
a white racist group, and his case was
dismissed.

“This is a double political view where
views of a white racist are protected,
but black militants’ aren’t,” Anderson
said.

Anderson concluded by saying “unless
more people start organizing activities to
make people aware, the universal
climate is not going to turn around.”

Cathedral of Learning, the
Student Environmental Action

Coalition (SEAC) staged a rally:
opposing the university’s _possi-- ~

Observatory in Arizona.

About a dozen SEAC members
collected signatures, passed out
support statements. and

informed students about issues
surrounding Mt. Graham.
Tamara Hayes, vice-president
of SEAC, said her organization
told students about the threat-
ened ecosystem; in particular,
the endangered Mt._ Graham red
squirrel, and an Apache religious

-site that could_b_e-endangered 

the proposed observatory.

“More than anything, we’re'

trying to educate people. They
were very receptive,” Hayes
said. ‘

Group members collected 500

petition signatures and approxi-
mately 300 support statements.
“I’m very satisfied with the
results,” said Matt Peters, head
of Native Issues at SEAC, a divi-
sion of the organization that
focuses on Native American
problems. " ' j
 Peters said -th'at"ov'er 1,500

Animal welfare activists discuss legislation for animal research

By Holly Affeltranger
Staﬁ" Writer

Students Organized for
Animals and Animal Research
sponsored a presentation and
panel discussion, “Animal Use
and Animal Welfare Issues
Facing Researchers in the
19905,” Friday afternoon at
Langley Hall.

The panel, which consisted of
four animal welfare organiza-
tions, spoke on the difference
between animal welfare and
animal rights, the importance of
animal research to our future
and what researchers can and
should do through legislation.

Norm Wilkerson, executive
director of the Pennsylvania
Society of Biomedical Research,
said it is difficult for animal
research to continue because of
the way animal rights activists
educate young people about
how unethical it is to practice
animal research.

“Just think of what happens if
we raise a generation of people
who believe any use of an ani-
mal is unethical,” Wilkerson
said.

Other reasons that have made
it more difficult for animal
research to continue is the
increase of animal extremists
and the legislation they have

passed, he said.

Ken Brandt, a member of
Pennsylvanians for the
Responsible Use of Animals,
spoke on the importance of ani-
mal use in entertainment, agri-
culture, hunting and biomedical
research.

“If a hundred years ago they
did not use animals for research
most of us wouldn’t be here,”
he said.

Brandt, a former legislator for
Pennsylvania, also recommend-
ed what researchers should do
to get legislation for animal wel-
fare and research.

“You have to get to know
these individuals [legislators]

and what their own ideals and
goals are,” Brandt said. “Let
them know who you are when
your issue comes up and they
will remember you.”

Dr. Paul Bramson, Pitt direc-
tor of Central Animal Facility,
said one of his main concerns
was the dilierence between ani-
mal welfare and animal rights.

Animal welfare was described
by Bramson as organizations
that believe that animals are
able to feel pain and distress; so

they should be humanely treat— ,

ed during biomedical research.
Bramson said that animal

rights organizations believe that

all animals have feelings as

humans do, so they should
have the same rights as
humans.

The legislation that has been
passed by animal rights activists
has made it very difficult for
animal researchers to do their
work, Brandt said.

“In the last 15 years, the cost
for everything has skyrocketed
because of the animal rights
organizations whom have
passed legislation,” Bramson
said.

Dan Goodwin, a member of
Americans for Medical Research,
told the researchers and future
researchers in the audience that

wards, not everyone was so fortunate.
Whether on their own or due to someone else
falling on them, many people lost their balance.
Jim Robertson, a second-year Pitt law student,
summed up several people’s thoughts about the
event. “It’s free and it’s late in the term. It’s a
chance to get away from studying,” he said.
According to Tom Driscol, the assistant manag-
er of the rink, about 50 percent of their business
comes from college students.

“We were wondering if we were even going to
open tonight. We couldn’t make the ice like we
wanted to,” he said. “We lucked out.”

The ice was a bit rough because it was so thin,
but Driscol said there were plans to thicken it in
the next week or so.

The rate for skating is $3.00 and $1.50 for skate V

rental. Group lessons are also available, $20 for 4
lessons of freestyle skating or hockey.

Admission will also be free next Monday thanks

typical thinking and to obtain
first hand, in depth and impar-
tial insights into Japanese cul-
ture. Through this thoughtful
analysis, American universities
can play a role in strengthen-
ing technology transfer, trade
relations and human relations
between these two economic
super powers.”

Brown said that the close-
ness of both universities will
aid the program but was not
the main reason Pitt and CM
were selected.

“The proximity will work
best for us,” she said. “But the
selection was based around
what universities could best
oﬁ°er the program.”

The Japanese Science and
Technology Management
Program is a collaborative
effort between Pitt’s Asian
Studies Program and the
Carnegie Bosch Institute for
Applied Studies in
International Management at
Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate
School of Industrial
Management of Industrial
Administration (GSIA).

Beginning in February, both

universities will also offer a
four—week lecture series fea-
turing a discussion about
Japanese management
method of technology in sci-
ence. These lecture sessions,
which will be held at the
Mellon Auditorium on the CM
campus, will be open to the
public and free of charge.

Both universities, offering a
variety of scholarships, will
present unique educational
opportunities to Japanese
management students. Pitt’s
Computer Assisted Instruction
program for teaching Japanese
will provide an innovative
computer program for learn-
ing Japanese writing.

Pitt’s program, a bit Inore
involved than CM’s, will
require 20 to 25 hours a week
of language and culture train-
ing. Steve Brener, research
associate for Pitt’s Asian
Studies Program, will serve as
the program manager. The
first classes in the program will
begin in January 1995.

“The financial incentive is
here also,” Brown said.
“Hopefully, we will get ener-
getic students to apply.”

health care plan, he said.

Wofford was quick to point
out that this is only one of
many steps that the govern-
ment plans to take to make the
domestic future a better one.

“We need to begin [with this
step]. We won’t end with this
first action,” he said.

According to Perkins, now is
the “most exciting time [for
students] to be involved with
international affairs.”

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said that Pitt needs
to take an active role to be
seen and heard in the world’s
foreign relations problems.

“We must help to solve the
world’s pressing problems,” he
said.

Perkins said that we as a
country need to change with
the times.

“As the world around us
changes, we as a nation must
change, we can’t help [but
change],” he said.

Concerning how we could
take steps to change, Perkins
said we need to do two things:
recognize the opportunity to
change and know what to do
with the opportunity.

Along with the United
States, the United Nations also
needs to change, Perkins said.

“The United Nations is work-
ing with a structure built for
1950 but must deal with the
issues of 1992,” he said.

Perkins said that situations
such as apartheid and terror-

ism have caused the United
Nations to take steps to change
but needs to dolmuch more.

Among the many things that
the United Nations needs to do
is take steps to rebudget, deal
with redundancies and to con—.
struct new population pro-
grams and food programs, he
said.

“I found it very interesting
that they both agreed we’re on
an era of change; it’s there, it’s
a very dynamic time,” said Earl
Onque, associate dean of
GSPIA.

As far as Wofford’s future is
concerned, he has high hopes.

“Your generation will see a
period of social invention-for
the next four years. We are
reinventing government so that
they’re less bureaucratic and
more social,” he said.

International, Chris
Chyrsovergis, said he was
disappointed with the poor
turnout for the speech.
“People feel threatened
that they may address the
issue. It takes a lot of ener-
gy to face what is evil and
ugly, for it shatters the
foundation of what every-
one commonly thinks is
American justice.”

Chyrsovergis said that
Amnesty International isn’t
the “fad” it used to be.
People are afraid of the
label “bleeding hearts” that
is tied to being concerned
with human rights.

Other activities for the
week include a Toast to
Freedom on Wednesday at
Hemingway’s in which
Hemingway’s will match
the price of the first drink
bought by each person and
will donate that money to
Amnesty International.

Thursday, a vigil outside
the union will be held for
the victims of human rights
violations around ‘the

be a Write—A-Thon on

Café where students can
write letters to help release

a policy by an outside force,”
Steffan said. “It is essentially
impossible for the organiza-
tion to change the policy on
its own.”

Steffan said the battle to end
discrimination will be won
because President-elect Bill
Clinton has agreed to change
the policy.

He said he is hopeful that
through Clinton, the U.S. mili-
tary will catch up with the rest
of the world. Of the countries
that comprise NATO, only
Great Britain and the United
States have sexually-discrimi-
nating policies for the military.

Steffan said he began to
come to terms with what he
called a growing lack of con-
fusion about his own sexuality
his sophomore year at the
naval academy.

“It wasn’t a matter of
choice,” Steffan said. “I never
wanted to be gay, I never
chose to be gay, but I under.-
stood finally that it is who I

By his senior year Steffan
was a battalion commander,
one of the 10 highest-ranking
midshipmen at the academy
and ready to graduate.

Then a friend of Steffan’s
told Navy administration that
Steffan had admitted he was
gay. When asked if he was
gay, Steffan replied,"’Yes, sir, I
am.”

“It was as though the [Navy]
was asking me, ‘Are you
ashamed enough of who you
are to deny that identity, to
get this diploma that you’ve
been working so hard for the
past four years?” he said.

Steffan has been fighting his
own battle in the courts since
December 1988, with three
remedies in mind: the end to
gay and lesbian military dis-
crimination, his reinstatement
into the military and his diplo-
ma.

Women in the military are
five to eight times more likely
to be discharged for homosex-
ual discrimination, Steffan
said.

Democratic deﬁciency

The potential was there. For the first time since Teddy
Roosevelt formed his splinter Bull Moose Party in 1912,
America had a serious third-party candidate — H. Ross Perot.
Dismissed by much of the media as a freak of nature, Perot
faced an uphill battle ever since his emergence on the scene.

Much of the criticism was  A total revamping of the
government, Perot said, is what is necessary for this country
to work again. As such, this little man with the big ears
proved to have dictatorial tendencies. But had Perot not re-
entered the race the the candidates surely would have
ignored the deﬁcit issue. Despite the fact that he Wasn’t the
best man to carry the important message of political reform,
in recent times Perot proved to be the most successful. It
wasn’t so much that 19 percent of the population voted for
him, as it was that they voted against the alienation that
occurs under a two—party system.

Last night in Washington, D.C., the seeds of reform planted
by Perot were given-a little sunlight, and the roots fertilized
once again. Members of “third parties” all over the country
met to discuss what they could do to increase political repre-
sentation in America. Unfortunately, the success of the Perot
candidacy and lack of success of the Libertarian party (a legiti-
mate third party in its own right) proves that little can be
done nowadays unless one has the proper financial
resources.

Third—party representation is something that has been “out
there” since the beginning of our government but has met
with little success. This is due, in part, to the archaic manner
in which presidential candidates are elected. The electoral col-
lege was established in order to keep a check on the “igno-
rant masses.” Since electoral college votes are based on a
“winner—take—all ethic” it is virtually impossible for third parties
to get the proper recognition.

SecEjn”clly;“tl1‘e’media ‘themselves have to take a greater
responsibility. As one reader pointed out to us, the
Pennsylvania senatorial election is a perfect example. The
Associated Press reported that Lynn Yeakel and Arlen Specter
accounted for 100 percent of the votes cast. Yet, at the same
time, the Libertarian candidate John Peny was reported as
having received 5 percent of the popular Vote. Clearly this is a
contradiction. The media are supposed to remain “objective,”
in their reporting. All too often we ignore things that should
be recognized. 4

Sometimes we holler reform too quickly, and the results are
often devastating. But that old political standby —- the two-
party system —- has proven to be constipated. The riots in Los
Angeles showed the world that, irrespective of what party has
been in power, the wishes of many Americans are pushed
aside. Surely in a country of 270 million people, a third party
will do little to change the alienation which occurs.
Nevertheless, it will do something. We know that you “can’t
satisfy all of the people all of the time,” but this conference
will hopefully be the stepping stone toward greater participa-
tion.

Rewriting the stories of our heroes

A new day has dawned in
American politics. Bill Clinton,
America’s choice as an agent for
change, will soon be sitting in
the Oval Office. With the
Democrats controlling Congress,
our national leaders will soon
institute sweeping reforms
throughout our government.
The vanquished Republican
Party has laid the Sword of

Democracy at the feet of Sir Bill .

so that he and his vassals M may
use it to destroy the various
ghouls and goblins of American
policy and slay the Economic
Dragon which has terrorized the

hapless citizens of the United

States for the past four years so
that theyﬁmay live happily ever
after. Or so the story goes.

The truth is that the

- Democrats, Bill Clinton especial-

ly, could be in for some very
rough times over the next four
years. Moreover, if Clinton’s
presidency is a failure — irre-
spective of whose fault it is —
then surely the American peo-
ple will question whether or not
Democrats have the capability
of running the White House.
Clinton is going to have to be
extremely careful not to repeat
the mistakes of the past.

Many of the campaign
promises which he made are
not going to help him. Some of
them are going to be extremely
difficult to implement, and
others could prove potentially
disastrous for the country if
they are. Three areas where
Clinton’s campaign promises
may be his undoing are foreign
policy, health care and the
economy.

Foreign policy was a topic
that received little attention dur-
ing the election campaign. It is
therefore difficult to say what
the new Clinton administration
will do. One thing that Clinton
has suggested is that one major
theme to his administration is
the promotion of human rights
throughout the world. While
this is truly a noble gesture, its
implementation may prove dis-

..aslrous if. ??‘Tl.‘°<$1. cut — in par-

ticular his stands on China’s
Most Favored Nation (MFN) sta-
tus and intervention in
Yugoslavia.

All gather round, it is here
that we begin our story.

Once upon a time, there was
a young hero — Perseus _—
who had to prove himself by
taking on many great tasks. The
first task he set for himself was
to defeat _t_he__evil medusa He
did this by using anmirrowr toll"
show her the error of her ways
and reﬂect the evil which she
imposed on others back upon
herself. In mythology, as in
most stories, there is usually a

O
Mrchaa
C O '
Brrttmgham
happy ending.

But if Bill Clinton isn’t careful,
the story could read a lot differ-
ently. This may seem a rather
simplistic and childlike way of
viewing the issue of China’s
MFN status, but it serves to illus-
trate the point. Clinton wants to
force China to reevaluate its
human rights policies by revok-
ing or threatening to revoke
China’s MFN status. This would
have dire consequences for US-
Sino relations and for the
Chinese people.

The United States and China
have grown closer over the past
decade. We’ve been able to
work with them in many areas
of foreign policy which are
essential for our national securi-
W- '

China. has been increasingly
cooperative in international
efforts to deter nuclear prolifera-
tion, and their acquiesance was
needed for the United Nations
to act against Iraq. The isolation
of China would destroy the
unity which has made the
United Nations such an effective
force in world affairs in recent
years. Such punative actions
against China would also harm
the Chinese people by derailing
economic reforms there.
Moderates within the Chinese

government have been steadily
gaining inﬂuence over the past
few years. Any attempt to pun-
ish China would only serve to.
set back those very reforms we
wish to see in place.

Let us move on to another lit-
tle story. Our hero is sailing the
ship of state through treacher-
ous waters. Soon he begins to
hear the seductive call of the
sirens, singing of human rights.

V What if our hero succumbs to

their calls and sends his ship
into the rocks ahead? What if he
sends himself and his crew to
their doom? The parallel
between this story and Clinton’s
desire to use American military
intervention to protect the
Bosnians from Serbian aggres-
sion is more than a little omi-
nous.

The conﬂict in Yugoslavia is
not simply a political or ideo-
logical struggle. It is a racial
struggle that has gone on for a
millennia-. United States inter-
vention would be severely ham-
pered by the fact that the forces
there are irregular troops —
armed civilians —- not profes-
sional soldiers. There is no con-
crete force to light, only small
groups of people engaging in

guerilla warfare and indiscrirni- ‘

nate slaughter. The difference is
that if the United States
becomes militarily involved, it
will be Americans, not just
Bosnians, Serbians and
Croatians, being slaughtered.
Clinton’s desire to end the con-
ﬂict at any cost could end up
engaging the United States in a
conflict that we have as little
chance to win as Vietnam,
which Clinton so ably avoided.
What will the future hold for
our hero? Only time will tell.
But before we close the book
on our hapless hero, let us take
a look at another little story..

McNeal, Mobley power Pitt hoops by Marathon

By Rob Pugliese  ,

Sports Assistant

Pitt had just two weeks of
practice entering last night’s
exhibition game —— and it
showed.

The Panthers played flat
and uninspired basketball
but performed just well
enough to win, outlasting
Marathon Oil 92-88 in their
season debut at Fitzgerald
Field House.

Senior power forward
Chris McNea1 led the way
with 19 points and nine
rebounds while junior cen-
ter Eric Mobley chipped in
with 11 points, nine
rebounds and five blocked
shots. ’

“We were a little flat
tonight,” McNeal said. “We
didn’t play as well as we

wanted to  we got the win
but the 40 minutes got a lit-
tle shock to our legs
tonight.”

Panther head coach Paul
Evans said his club played
about as well as could be
expected under the condi-
tions. ’

“It’s tough after two weeks
of practice to have every-
thing together,” Evans said.
“We had some good

had some bad moments
we can’t be all disappointed

The exhibition tilt marked
the return of senior Antoine
Jones, who redshirted last
season with a foot injury.
Jones appeared physically
stronger after the year off,
contributing eight points

Steel City Stars shoot up
Pitt hoe/eey club 9- 7

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

In a virtual smorgasbord of offensive firepower, the Pitt
Hockey Club was outgunned by the Steel City Stars, 9-7,
at the Blade Runners ice complex in Harmorville on
Saturday. ,

The Panther loss negated an incredible performance by
centerman Bill Crousey, who figured in on all of Pitt’s
seven goals — scoring five and assisting. on two more.

“When we win, we win as a team. And when we lose,
we lose as a team,” Crousey said. “If we end up" losing
the game, it doesn’t matter what I did.” '

9 Individual standouts for the Stars included a four—goal

- night for Derek Schott, five points for Bill Graham (one

goal, four assists) and four points for centerman Keith
Reed, (three goals, one assist).

The two teams played on even terms for the first half
of the opening period, before Schott scored on a break-
away at 9:48 of the period to give the Stars a 1-0 lead.

A little over one minute later, Stars’ goalie Frank
Mastandrea threw the puck against the boards, where it
was picked up by Graham. He entered the Pitt zone

along the right side and ﬂipped a wrist shot underneath

Panthers
shake rust
against Oil

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Pitt’s exhibition
game with Marathon
Oil was a good chance
for the Pitt coaches
and fans to see how
rusty the Panther bas-
ketball team is at this
point and exactly
where the polishing
needs to be done the
most.

It is hard to get a
firm grip on exactly
where the Panthers
stand as a group after
playing Marathon Oil

-— a glorified traveling
playground team —
but it was a little easi-
er to see where some
of the individual play-
ers stand at this early
point of the preseason.

There is no doubt
some Panthers were
hard at work over the
summer. The most
noticeable Panther
improvement was the
free throwing and con-
ditioning of center Eric
Mobley.

“I practiced my free
throws [in the offsea-
sonl,” Mobley said. “I
stayed here all sum-
mer, and I think I went
home a total of only
about a week over the
summer. Hopefully it’ll
pay off.”

“I heard Eric worked
hard all summer,” Pitt
assistant coach Joe

Loss shows decline of Pitt football

For those lonesome souls
who weathered the semblance
of a college football game at
three—quarters—empty Pitt
Stadium last Saturday (that’s
the Pitt—Louisville matchup for
most of you apathetic Pitt stu-
dents), the Cardinals 31-16 vic-
tory over the 3-7 Panthers
won’t go down in history as
one of the greatest memories
in the program’s storied histo-
ry.
. ere was no bowl bid at
stake, _no compelling action to
note and no real reason to
give a damn about the out-
come of this matchup of medi-
ocrity. ‘ , '

Because there was such a
sad and pathetic atmosphere at
an institution whose football
program owns nine national
championships, no one should
ever forget what happened on
Nov. 14 and the rest of 1992
— not the students, the alum-
nus, the faculty and most
importantly, Chancellor J.

Dennis O’Connor and Director
of Athletics Oval Jaynes.
Flashback to Frustration.
For those of you that missed
the last home game of the
1992 season (that includes
everyone in the greater
Pittsburgh area save the Pitt
Band, a few grand more-than-
loyal alumnus and a smattering

Brian
Gallagher

of sober undergraduates),
here’s what happened:

Two teams heading in
adamantly different directions
faced off in front of almost no
one and played a game that
reinforced the yearlong trends
of both programs (one dying,
the other thriving).

0 Pitt played its patented
brand of mistake-ﬁlled football

(two fumbles, five intercep-
tions, numerous missed tack-
les) and turned a potentially
competitive game into a laugh-
er midway through the third _
quarter. The rest of the game
was the same—old stat—padding
session for the Panthers’ any-
thing—but-clutch offense —
turning a blowout into a palat-
able defeat.

0 Louisville —- like any other
decent Division I team with
the wherewithal to convert
turnovers into points — took
advantage of the Panthers’
ineptitude and delivered a
solid knockout blow to an
opponent once thought of as
formidable. Though a young,
inexperienced team, the
Cardinals barrelled through a
tortuous schedule to the beat
of a respectable 5-6 record.

Translation: it was just
another snoozer-of-a-disap-
pointment in a season filled
with J underachieving, mistake-

DeSantis said. “He was
at the gym every
Saturday morning
working out, lifting
weights and getting
into shape.”

Another player who
stood out was senior
Antoine Jones. You
would never know he
redshirted last year. He
was strong to the hoop
and showed poise and
leadership on the
floor. His shooting was
the only area in which
he showed rustiness
was his shooting.

“Uonesl played a lot
better tonight, but he
did have some jitters,”
Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said.

Chris McNeal got off
to what seemed like a
slow start in the first
half, but exploded in
the second half and
showed hints of his
ability to be a force in
the Big East at power
forward this season.

“It’s not that I was
slow in the first half,
but I was getting the
ball in inside the low
post in the second half
so I was a lot more
effective in the second
half due to the pace of

the game,” McNea1
said.
Point guard Jerry

McCullough was just as
fast going to the hoop
as he was last year, so
not much improvement
could have been made
there. Perhaps he
needs some work at
the outside jumper.
The last of Evans’
preseason starting five,
shooting guard Ahmad
Shareef, shot the out-
side jumper fairly well
— going four for nine.

to make it 2-0.

The Panthers got on the
board with 5:28 remaining in
the first, when defenseman
Scott Giordano weaved his
was across the goal mouth
and set the table for Crousey,
who knocked the puck into
an open net to get Pitt back
within one goal at 2-1.

Crousey then tied the game
for Pitt exactly one minute
later with a power-play goal
assisted by Steve Karas. The
period ended with the score
tied at two.

The floodgates flew open
for both teams in a high—scor-
ing second period.

The Stars climbed back on
top just 33 seconds into the
second frame with a goal by
Reed, assisted by Graham.

The Panthers bounced back
to tie the game at 3-3 with a
goal by Vic DiSanti, assisted
by Crousey and Kip Linse, at
3:23 of the period. Then, just
two minutes later and Pitt
shorthanded by two men,
Crousey stole the puck at the
Stars line, came in tight on
goal and flipped the puck
under a sprawling Mastandrea
to give Pitt its first lead of the
game at 4-3.

After the Stars tied the game
on another goal by Reed,
Crousey picked up the puck
along the boards, went
behind the net and beat
Mastandrea on the wrap-
around for his fourth goal to
give Pitt a 5-4 lead. He was
not finished yet.

The Crousey scoring
machine went back into
action after the Stars tied the

game with 4:24 left in the
period on a goal by Amby
Bauer, assisted by.Reed and
Bob Suchevits. A little over
one minute later, Crousey
entered the Stars’ zone along
the right side and deked the
goalie and shoveled the puck-
up underneath the crossbar
for his fifth goal, giving Pitt a
6-5 lead.

The Stars closed out the
second period by tying the
game on a freaky goal with
2:33 remaining. The Stars’
Schott fired the puck off a Pitt
defenseman and while
Babcock looked for it off to
his right, it trickled in behind
him to tie the game for the
Stars.

The Stars opened up the
third-period scoring with
Reed’s third goal of the game
(3:32 Graham) to take a 7-6

lead. Schott then increased
the Stars’ lead with his third
goal to make it 8-6.

Pitt tightened the gap with a
power-play goal by Dave
Koval (15:30 Crousey) to cut
the Stars lead to 8-7.

\Y/ith 1:25 left in the game
and the Stars on the power
play, the Pitt defense got
caught back in the offensive
zone and Schott made them
pay with his fourth goal of the
game. This gave the Stars the
9-7 lead which stood the rest
of the way. The loss drops the
Panthers to 2-4 on the year.

“We are not playing our
positions well,” Hockey Club
President Mike Mahoney said.
“Right now, we really need to
gel as a team unit.”

The Panthers’ next game is
against Duquesne at the Civic
Arena this Saturday.

Forward Orlando Antigua

-resprained his ankle in

practice this week and did
not play, but Evans said
Antigua will probably be
able to practice mmthis
week.

Brian Brush gave some
quality minutes, ending up
with eight points and six
rebounds.

His biggest contribution —
along with other seniors
McNeal and Jones -— was
definitely the floor leader-
ship shown during the
game.

Some of the new players
showed some real promise,
especially junior college
transfer Marlon Rhymes, a
point guard, and Garrick
Thomas, who played for-
ward.

Rhymes showed the ability
to literally run the team up
thefloor and ran the fast
break like a champ.

“Marlon played real well,
and we expect him to see a
lot  this year,” Evans said.

Also, newcomer Jason
Maile played real solid at off
guard.

McNeal analyzed the over-
all Panther performance.

“We were a little flat

’ tonight, but we played good

enough to get the win,”
McNeal said. “You’ll see a
lot better team [in the
futurel.”

goal in the first five min-
utes while falling behind
9-5. The sluggish Panthers
failed to establish much
continuity in either the
halfcourt set or the transi-
tion game until junior col-
lege transfer Marlon
Rhymes entered the game
at the 14:08 mark, with Pitt
down 14-11.

With .the 6-foot-4-inch
Rhymes running the show,
the Panthers reeled off an
impressive 18-3 run that
started with a short jumper
by Ahmad Shareef. Then
the versatile creator
Rhymes took over.

He hit two free throws to
pull Pitt within one point
at 16-15. Moments later,
Mobley excited the sparse
crowd of 1,443 with a
powerful one—handed
thunder dunk on a feed
from Rhymes. That tied the
contest at 17 and began a

streak of 14 consecutive ‘

Panther points. The silky
smooth Rhymes wowed the
crowd with a slick look-
away feed to Shareef, who
converted the layup and
was fouled. His free throw
made it 20-17 Pitt. The
next trip, Rhymes drilled a
long-range three-pointer
from the left wing to give
Pitt breathing room at 23-

17.

A foul-line jumper by
Brian Brush sandwiched
between two free throws
and and a follow by
McNeal opened the bulge
to 29-17. Pitt’s largest lead
of the night was 14 points,
which they held for the
last time at 35-21 on a
layup by Chris Gant.

From that point,
Marathon Oil controlled
the remainder of the
first half behind 6”10”
center Scott Patterson —
an Akron University prod-
uct.

Patterson scored nine of
Marathon’s next 12 points,
working inside to bring his
team within seven at 38-
31.

Georgia Tech alum
Brooke Steppe heated up,
converting a three-point
play then sinking a leaning
trey to suddenly make it
38-37.

Panther floor general
Jerry McCullough made the
first of his two spectacular
plays on the night, driving
the length of the floor and
taking the rock inside for a
dazzling scoop shot off the
glass to make it 40-37.
Then Mobley gave Panther
faithfuls a glimpse of his
fierce intimidation, swat-
ting two consecutive shots.

After the inconsistent
opening 20 minutes, Pitt
led 42-41.

After suffering through a
chilly .414 shooting effort
in the first half, Pitt heated
up to almost 55 percent in
the second stanza.
Workhorse McNeal was
largely responsible, cash-
ing in 15 of his 19 markers
after the intermission.

“I was getting the ball
where I was most effective
on the low block,” he said.
“Guys were looking for me
cutting to the basket.”

However, the Panthers
could not pull away, push-
ing their margin to double
digits just once — that
with merely three-and-a-
half minutes remaining. _

Mobley threw down a
two—handed slam to put
the Panthers up 46-41. He
then found McNeal for an
easy two, making it 50-44.
But Marathon Oil scrapped
and clawed its way back to
tie the game at 50. They
would knot the contest
five more times, but the
Panthers did not falter with
first-year guard Jason Maile
scoring eight points in a
five-minute span that kept
the Panthers in control
with the score 74-67.

McCullough’s second
thriller of thenight came

on a dazzling double-
clutch, hanging scoop
shot, making it 79-70.
McNeal sealed the win tip-
ping in a Jones’ miss and
hitting a spinning half-
hook on consecutive trips,
which gave Pitt a 10-point
cushion with 3:36 remain-
ing.

Panther Paws:_ McCullough
and Shareef also broke
double figures with 11 and
10 -points respectively.

Sophomore forward
Orlando Antigua did not
see action due to a
sprained ankle which he
aggravated during Friday’s
practice. Antigua has not
practiced since, but Evans
said he expects him to
recover by week’s end.

Evans cited Mobley’s
tremendous improvement
at the free-throw line.
Mobley’s work over the
summer appeared obvious
as he sank four of six at
the line.

Mobley’s first thunder
dunk of the year came at
11:36 of the first half on a
feed from Rhymes.

Evans’ first technical of
the season came with 1:15
remaining in the first half.

The soon-to-be—legen-
dary “Panther Paul” per-
formed for -the crowd just
once, with 6:59 to play.

prone efforts against oppo-
nents that at one time, no too
long ago, couldn’t carry Pitt’s
collective jocks.

Remember this game.

Pall Bearers Wanted.

The Pitt Band should’ve
played “Taps.” That’s what it
felt like in Pitt Stadium — a
funeral procession.

Losing does that to a pro-
gram, a school and a stadium.

Call it the Season of the
Wake. A team that seems to
care, seems to try, but just
can’t put it all together for 60
minutes against a semi—formi-
dable opponent. This is Pitt
football in 1992, ladies and
gentlemen.

That trend of losing — to
teams once thought of as pat-
sies as well as the fierce rivals
— has gotten so bad that
opposing coaches are now
expressing pity toward the
obvious demise of the once-
grand Panther football pro-
gram.

Louisville Coach Howard
Schnellenberger voiced his dis-
appointment toward the lack
of interest in the team by
reﬂecting on the dismal crowd
of 14,065 that witnessed the
Cardinals’ season—ending win.

§“I was saddened and dis— -

heartened to see this proud, 6
proud tradition be in such
trouble,” Schnellenberger said
after the game Saturday. “It’s
distressful.”

What’s more distressful is

the fact-that-th-is-downward... .. 

spiral has continued to these

murky depths. When opposing
coaches from schools with less
tradition actually feel the need

A blocked punt was just one of many signs of problems for Pitt football last Saturday against Louiville.

to publicly acknowledge their
sorrow for Pitt’s football woes,
you know it’s more than bad.

‘ It’s getting real pitiful, folks.

What’s next}: Coaches offer- '
ing to play Pitt 10-on‘-11 on ‘
both sides of the ball? Maybe
an extra down for the
Panthers’ offense. Here’s a
brainchild: Maybe we need a
change in leadership?

_......Remember..this pity.
W'l1at’s It Gonna Be?  --

One question to those in
charge of the fate of this less-
than-healthy Pitt football pro-

gram: When is enough
enough? .

When do the embarrassing
losses and empty seats
become so intolerable that
changes are made and a new
direction is taken?

Better yet, when will some-
one realize that the academic ‘
demands on the players do
more harm than good? The
loss of re_cr..uit$... S.1.1_Sp.§=.Q§i.9.I1.§. ..__

and transfers are depleting the U

talent pool that thecoaches at
Pitt have a chance to work
with. These questions sound

simple to answer (fire the
coach or lower the academic
requirements), but it’s not so

— cut and dried.

On one side, O’Connor and
Jaynes have to consider the
noble-but—unrealistic “let’s be
the Northwestern of the Big
East” academic ideas —- where
requirements to enter and play
at Pitt are considerably higher

N , than rival. universities.

On the other side, Jaynes
has his hands tied in any
attempt at a coaching change
(courtesy of past coaching hir-

 

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News

ings and firings by former A.D.
Ed Bozik).

Return to glory or a down-
shift to Division I—A status is
the future of this ﬂailing pro-
gram. The fate of the future is
in the hands of these two men.

Let’s hope they make the
obvious right course of action.
Let’s hope they make it soon
—- before it’s too late.

Hey powers that be, remem-
ber the players, fansand alum-
nus.
