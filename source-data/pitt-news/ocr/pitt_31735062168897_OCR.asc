P PESO: University Students’ Friend



 
      
 
 

(Editor's Note: PESO is a new program
at the University. It is designed to assist
students interested in graduate or profes-
sional study and is similar to the Placement
Office which assists students in securing
jobs.)

by ALAN E. BARR

PESO, the Post-baccalaureate Educa-
tional Services Office of the College of
Arts and Sciences, serves students interest-
ed in graduate and professional studies.
PESO was initiated March, 1968, and is
being coordinated by Mrs. June Rubel.

The College of Arts and Sciences feels
that it is an appropriate responsibility for
them to provide information, counseling
services, and proper guidance for students
seeking professional and graduate study.
Mrs. Rubel points out that the first place

,, for a student to begin inquiring about

graduate work is with the department of
his or her major.

‘Pitt News’ Wins
All American Award

For the first time since 1962 the Pitt News won the All-American
award from the 79th All—American Newspaper Critical Service Judges.
The Associated Collegiate Press (ACP) judges, professional newspa-
per men and women with extensive backgrounds in publications work
critically reviewed student newspapers submitted from more than 500
colleges and universitites across the nation. The Pitt News entered
one news publication for each week during the 1968 period of Febru-

PESO has initiated six goals or func-
tions for itself in order to serve students.
It will assist in the development of student
dossiers indicating genuine personal eval-
uation of a student which provides the has-
is for accurate recommendations to grad-
uate and professional schools.

Mrs. Rubel explained, in relation to
the dossier, that any student, especially if
he or she is not immediately thinking of
graduate work, should secure letters of
recommendation a nd related material
while still a student at school. A

“By having letters placed on file now,
students can be confident of recommenda-
tions in the future even though the profes-
sors who knew them best may have left»
the University,” she said.

Another goal PESO is actively pursu-
ing is expanding the Special Fellowship
Program and assisting in identifying stu-

dents for various programs such as the
Woodrow Wilson, Rhodes and Marshall.

A helpful aid for_ a student in choosing
graduate programs is to know how other
students with similar undergraduate back-
grounds have performed in graduate pro-
grams. The information for this function
will require time to be compiled, neces-
sitating a constant up-dating.

Another important function for PESO
is that of a repository for technical infor-
mation about specific programs, financial
support and applications for deadlines.

For example, this will enable a student
who might be interested in film or televi-
sion production to easily find out what
schools offer professional studies in these
fields. --

Information concerning financial -aid
for such a professional program is also
available. At present, published informa-
tion concerning many professional studies

is difficult to obtain by individual stu-
dents.

PESO is also investigating the possi-.

bility and usefulness of conducting sem-

inars for the benefit of underclssmen to.

determine majors most appropriate for
their graduate and/or professional goals.

A reading room containing a complete
collection of bulletins describing graduate
and professional programs throughout the
United States and selected foreign areas
will be made available to upperclassmen.

“Many students do not realize the op-
portunity to continue their education
past the Baccalaureate degree. We want
to communicate to the students the oppor-

_ tunities available,” says Mrs. Rubel.

Along with PESO, there are 23 Univer-
sity departments which can help students
towards graduate and professional study.

ary to June.

In Chicago last August, the ACP judged student newspapers on
the basis on contentgwriting and makeup in categories based on enroll-

ment, frequency of publication,
and method of printing.

Judged in six categories, the
Pitt News received a total of 3,-
760 points out of a possible total

- of 3,900.

In coverage, it earned 710
points out of a possible total of
800.

The general area of content, in-
cluding news stories, features, and
department pages, brought the
Pitt News 1,440 points out of a
perfect 1,500, with a special rec-
ognition in the area of sports cov-
erage.

Physical properties, which in-
cludes makeup, typography, and
headlines, received 1,610 points
from a total of 1,700, with the
photography section ea rn i n g a

The Pitt News received the All-
‘ American Award in 1962 a nd
earned the First Class Rating for
the years 1963-67.

Critchfield
Discussesa
Forum

by FRAN GLICKSMAN

Dr. Jack Critchfield, dean of
Student Affairs, hopes that the
Oct. 12 Open Academic Forum
designed to discuss the Student
Power issue “will get a large at-
tendance from the entire Univer-
sity, including students, faculty
members and administration.”

The meeting is an opportunity
for each segment of the Universi-
ty to mold together in both a lis-
tening and speaking experience.
The efforts being made aim for
complete communication within
the University structure through
complete openness and coopera-
tion. Dr. Critchfield continues to
emphasize the need for a “true
educational environment” which
can result only through commun-
ication within each part of the
University itself and intercom-
munication between facets.

“Where is our entire student
b o d y ? ’ ’ Critchfield continued,
questioning the involvement of
all University students. Critch-
field wants complete representa-
tion amoung students and chal-
lenges “those in the group to
come forward within the group to
say what they mean.” He contin-
ued to emphasize that “the :ad-

Clark Urges Youth  
To “Give a Damn.”  

_ blocks to progress that need strong

by HARRIS MILLER

Senator Joseph S. Clark (D.-Pa.)
told a lunchtime audience at the
Duquesne University Student Un-
ion last Friday that “the-Ameri-
can political process can be im-
proved by the contribution of to-
day’s college and graduate stu-
dents if you will have the pati-
ence and persistence to work
within the system.”

Throughout his 20 minute
speech to the 250 gathered, the
Senator reiterated his pleas for
students not to sulk and remain
out of politics this year.

“I welcome the voices and the
opinions of the new American
generation,” Clark declared, “but
I would like to see that energy
and talent used to improve our
system, not to defy it. I see no
constructive purpose served ‘by
capping out.”

Clark _ cited‘, two particular road

 
   

reform: a

—The first is the U. S. Senate
which Clark feels needs changes
in filibuster rules and committee
rules among others. ~

—-Secondly, he talked of the nom-
ination of party candidates. While
admitting that a presidential pre-
ferential primary would not be a
panaces, he did say that “it is cer-
tainly preferable to the present
system.”

Senator Clark denounced again
the present U.S. policy in Viet-
nam. He briefly outlined hisplan
which calls for an immediate ces-
sation of the bombing of North
Vietnam and an immediate cease.
fire arrangement in the South. _

He criticized the Paris peace
talks on two bases. First, Presi-
dent Johnson, who is giving the

orders. has not been flexible b

rage 4—THE PI'l'l‘ NEWS—Monday, October 7, 1968

Analysis

Parents’ Weekend may have been superficial; it may
have only focused on Chancellors’ Receptions, a Broadway
play, and a successful football game. But it’ proved that many
students here are not complacent. In fact, the Weedend events
indicated that the students at the University want to be active
—they yearn for something with which they can identify. But
we are stymied.

The effects of our industrial society—the technological
revolution—-have had a bearing on University living patterns.
People in the University community keep to themselves—they
are not really interested in other people. One students says
the University looks warm on the outside, but inside the con-
fines of our campus it is very cold.

What is true at the University is generally true of the so-
cieyt—the atmosphere is very cold. Everyone becomes caught
up in the rat race—a race to see who is going to make the most
money; a race to see who will have the most influence; a race
up the frivolous ladder of success; a race to see who will
make the best grades; and a race to see which students will
be accepted to the “name” graduate schools.

The rat race places a prodigious importance on achieve-

: ment and a miniscule significance on interpersonal relations.

-In the rat race some people make good, and some experience
failure. And some people completely drop out of society—they
detach themselves from reality.

The University community, unlike some other college
communities, is a microcasm of the society. All of us experi-
ence the same pressures, the same successes, andthe same
failures that surface from day to day in the society. And in
this sense, it is good to spend four years at the University of
Pittsburgh, for students get a glimpse of the harsh realities of
the society.

Many students are nevertheless frustrated—frustrated with
University governance; frustrated with social regulations, and
frustrated with their educations. Many more students have
been frustrated with the football team. And students want to
eradicate their frustrations with the University community.

The same questions are always voiced: Why can’t the
football team win at least seven games, and why can’t women
decide their own curfews, and why can’t students agree on a
course of action, and why aren’t people more friendly on the
campus? -

The answer to these pepetual questions is “something
must be changed—something must be changed now.” It goes
without saying that change is the answer to our perpetual frus-
trations. But change takes responsibility, and responsibility
takes emotional maturity and perseverance. Above all, change
must be fomented by compromise.

There are a great many problems at this University.
There are also a great many problems being solved not by
‘confrontation, but by compromise and cooperation. Students
at this institution have made great inroads over the past few
lmonths. And the reforms have just begun. As one person says,
“Its a brand new ball game, and now anything goes.” I

' Students want to make many reforms in the society and
the University community. But all of us will stand a little
taller and grow a little wiser when we realize the changes we
seek will not be attained over night. Reality may be harsh, but
it’s quite necessary.

Student Involvement-Academically

Editor, The Pitt News:

Pitt students are concerned with
many things. They discuss dorm
regulations and girls’ curfews.
They fight over what musical
groups should provide the enter-
tainment for Homecoming. They
argue the merits of our football
team. Unfortunately. time pro-
hibits students from being in-
volved in all aspects of the Uni-
versity. Some areas must be giv-
en priority. When determining
what is most important to him.
the student should ask himself
why he is here. Trite as it sounds.
most reply they want to get an
education. This being the case. it
is only logical that the primary
concern of the student body
should be academic questions.
The quality of the curriculum
will have a far more lasting ef-
fect on Pitt students than will the
size of the Homcomingfloats.

More students must discuss and
take stands on the academic is-
sues before us. Should we have
a language requirement? A liber-
al arts cabinet surevey showed
that many feel the requirement
should be modified. But how?
Should students ‘I be given the
rights to decide for themselves if
they need ‘language training?
Likewise. is our distribution sys-
tem worthwhile? Is‘ it the key to
a liberal education or is it a. hin-
drance to the development of ex-
pertise? Only students who have
experienced the program a re
qualified to defend or attack it.

Many other changes are being
considered. What is the role of
pass-fail? Is it a trick for some-
one to use when he wants an easy
course or does it open the door to
new fields of knowledge? No

matter how many statistical ana-
lyses the administration conducts.
t h e final evaluation of s u c h
courses must rest with the stu-
dents. Do we want Pitt to "stress
interdisciplinary programs? As
students. do we find that such un-
dertakings clarify subjects or dis-
tort them.

Education is not static. Sub-
ject matter and teaching meth-
ods are constantly being re—eval-
uated. But‘ the administration
must prove what the students
want. Should credit be given for
field work in poverty areas? Is
this an academic activity? What
is the place of ROTC on campus?
Some students protest ROTC. yet
the majority voted at the last SG
election for it to keep its present
status. The students’ true feelings
must be known.

Any type of student involve-
ment is good. However. an in-
volvement that would make Pitt
more academically alert and for-
ward -‘looking would be most
worthwhile.

Greeks Are Also Conservative

Editor. The "Pitt News:

In recentweeks there has been
a call for students to_ unite. for
their own benefit. so that they
could confront the administration
and hash out grievances. This
thought ‘of “student power” was
based on the assumption that

Wesley W. Posvar and his co--

horts are conservative. too power-
ful. and behind the times. Before
we liquidate the edifices at Bige-
low and Fifth. should we not
glance at our own institutions and
be sure that they do not suffer
.-from “conservative. behind the
times” malaise?

That brings up that all too glee-
ful topic. the Greeks. It is safe to.
assume that the people on the
forefront of the student power
movement are liberal and pro-
gressive thinking persons.

Surprisingly, many of these

they be completely democratic

is the fraternity and sorority ever
meant as progressive and just in-

Yom Kippur “*""

Editor. The Pitt News:

Wednesday, Oct. 2, was Yom
Kippur. a sacred Jewish holy day.
In revernece of this holy day.
Jewish students were unable to
attend class.

Since Pitt has a large percent-
age of Jewish students, we are ap-
palled that professors. oblivious
to important Jewish ‘holidays.
schedule important lectures or
exams.

Of course. we do not expect the
entire university to close down.
but in a course where there is a
significant number of Jewish stu-
dents who will be missing class.

we do expect that the professor’

consider our religious obligations.

"We realize that a professor has
an enormous amount of informa-
tion to cover, but what good is a
lecture if the lecture room is half
empty.

Speakout
Saturday’s Win Nice,

ButSyracuseNoW&M

by Roy Jacobs
Sports Editor

There were many encouraging signs at the Stadium Satur-
day. But probably the most encouraging was the difference in the

locker room atmosphere.

Last week, after the loss to West Virginia, a palor hung over
the coaches’ and players’ dressing areas. Nobody wanted to talk
about the game, and there was a sickening feeling of uncertainty
concerning the future of the team.

But this Saturday the locker room was different after the
Panthers tripped William and Mary, 14-3. It wa.s looser, louder,
and happier. Instead of hanging their heads, the players looked
up and smiled.

Rod Fedorchak was so excited about the

» . win, in his zeal practically crushed head coach

, Dave Hart. Paul«Naponick’s eyes twinkled as

' = he reflected on one of the 14 times the William

_ . and Mary quarterback was nailed by the pass

 2 rush.Lloyd Weston, who did not play against

2 I the Indians, kidded about how hard it would
 _ be winning back his starting spot this week.

It’s great to be a winner, as one player
» pointed out, even if it was only William and
Mary. So many things _went .right—a_great
ground game, a good pass rush, a few lucky
breaks — that it was hard to remember some
of the things that went wrong.

It was good for the team and the coaches to get a wing under
gtheir belts. So much pressure had been built up that if a win
§hadn’t come Saturday, it might never have come this year. It
was good for the fans, too. Maybe the Panthers will draw more

But nobody can let the win go to their heads. It must be kept
in perspective. Even in the jubilation of the locker room, the
most frequently asked question by the players was, “What’s the
Syracuse final?”

The Syracuse game next week will be a tough one for sure,
but the Panthers are in the proper frame of mind now to go out

g and give the Orangemen an even battle. That is, with further im-
§ provement in certain areas.

this week, the same hit-’em-hard, up-the-middle attack might
work as well against Syracuse. Incidently, the first play the
Panthers have used in each of their three games so far and a
favorite first down play throughout has been the tailback off
guard. Perhaps opening the offense up a little might
catch Syracuse unawares.

Also, the offense needs to capitalize on the other team's
errors. Three times in the first quarter Saturday, the offense
got the ball after an Indian fumble. None were turned into
scores. ‘

The defense came on strong after a bad first quarter, and
with the pressure still on until the closing minutes, its confid-
ence should be boosted.

In all, the win Saturday was nice, but the toughest part of
the season is yet to come.

Panther Losing Streak

Ended At Eight Games

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

What happened Saturday afternoon was like July 4th and
New Year’s Eve wrapped into one beautiful celebration. What
happened was the Panthers beat the Indians of William & Mary, S

14-3 before only 17,116 fans.

The celebration was unusual. The Panthers had not won at home since
Parent’s Week-end two years and nine games ago when they dumped

WVU, 17-4. As a matter of fact, the Panthers had not won at home or

in enemy territory in their last eight games, dating back to a 13-11

squeeker over Wisconsin last year.

Everything looked so very
strange at Pitt Stadium. Before
the final gun ever sounded, the
goal post was torn down by a mob
of emotional students. And when
the gun did sound, the Panthers
whooped and hollered, and carried
coach Dave Hart off the field as
if they had just won a bowl game.

It was also strange to see sec-
ond and third string players ‘get
into the game for experience ra-
ther than necessity. Tailback
Dave Garnett for instance, got his
opportunity in the fourth quar-
ter.

Last week, Garnett was on the
field for just one series of downs
in a 38-15 loss to WVU. But
against William & Mary the 6-3,
220 pound speedster carried the
ball 9 times, good for 39 yards.

“I’m glad we were able to use
Garnett this way,” explained
Hart. “He needs the experience
and he got his opportunity today
while we were winning.”

Garnett replaced the Panther’s
Outstanding Player of the Game,
Dennis Ferris.

“Ferris was doing a real good
job,” said Hart. “He just kept
running and running.”

Ferris ran 33 times, good for
137 yards. seven first downs, and

a touchdown that started the
Panthers rolling in the second
quarter.

But Ferris wasn’t the whole
show. Sophomore quarterback
Dave Havern kept the Panthers on
the move throughout the game.

“Havern was over-anxious to-
day and in several occasions he
overthrew his man,” realized
Hart. “But he did his job.”

Havern passed just 17 times,
and only 5 times in the second
half as the Panthers played ball
control. But the 5-8 signal cal-
ler completed 7 passes for 109
yards, and also ran for a 9-yard
touchdown that clinched the vic-
tory.

“It was a broken play,” admit-
ted Hart. “He slipped and recover
ed by running the other way

The Panthers got a lot of other
breaks in the game. Towards the
end of the first quarter. William
& Mary attempted to break a 0-0
tie with a field goal attempt from
the Panther 13-yard line. but
the pass from center was over-
thrown. then fumbled. and then
recovered by.George Pribish.

The Panthers also recovered four
Indian fumbles. the fourth set-
ting up the second touchdown.

But William & Mary also had

Touclzdown called back

breaks. Time after time, the
gridders were penalized for il-
legal procedure or off-sides.

“They got over-anxious,” said
line coach Howard Weyers. “But
I liked the way "they played be-
cause that showed they were try-
ing. We got to go at ’em. that’s
the only way to play football.”

The Panthers committed many
other miscues, but when the final
gun sounded the scoreboard had a
higher number next to the home
team than next to the opponents,
and that was the most different
part of the afternoon.

“I’m satisfied that we won,
that’s the big thing,” explained
Hart. “We made a lot of mistakes,
but we played good, hardnosed
football for a change.”

Today. the celebration is over.
It’s down to hard work prepar-
ing for a much tougher Syracuse
eleven.

“I think this win is going to
help us.” said Hart.

“It’ s Been a Long Time’ ’ —Ferris

by MARTHA HARTLE

HAVERN to FERRIS
First Touchdown

     
     

It’s been a long road back to stardom for sophomore tail-
back Denny Ferris, but Saturday afternoon at the Stadium he
proved to himself, to the coaches and to the fans that the come-

back is complete.

Ferris came to Pitt three years ago, hearalded by many as the best
running prospect since Marshall Goldberg. But the speedster from
Pittsburgh North Catholic never got a chance to prove himself, as a
series of serious injuries kept him on the bench for the past two seasons.

This season, Ferris has re-
mained healthy, has run well,
and Saturday he led the Panthers
to their first home victory since
1966 as he picked apart the Wil-
liam and Mary defense for 137
yards in 33 carries.

“Saturday’s game was great,”
he exclaimed. “It’s been a long
‘time; it was my best game since
high school days. For a while I
was beginning to wonder if I’d
ever feel this way again. I’m lllst
really happy. ”

Ferris indicated that one play

.5,‘ worked consistantly all after-

- noon for‘the big gain. “It was a
basic play,” he explained, “a two-
lead which hit right off the guard.”

DENNY FERRIS (22) drove hard all afternoon, dragging William
and Mary defenders along with him. The sophomore tailback picked up
137 yards in 33 carries and narrowly missed breaking clear for severaal
other long gainers. «

Bubba’ Uses

Computer to
Win Contest

The infamous Yogis are look-
ing into the rumors that accuse
Art “Bubba” Rosengarten of
having a computer in his dormi-
tory room. The winner of last
year’s Fair-Pay Award might
beatitagain. , '

“You guys are just jealous that
I was 14-1, that’s all,” boasted
“Bubba.” “But you never had a
chance anyway. ”

“Don’t count your humpty—
dumpties before they fall off the
wall,” said Roy “Jumpshot” Ja-
cobs wisely. “There’s a long way
to go before this contest is over. "’

But if Bubba is proven guilty of
indulging in computer help, the
leading Yogi will be banned from
all future Yogi contests, Hawk
athletic events, teeth chipping,
exercises, and panty raids that
have dominated his way of life
in the past.

Frosh Kickers

The 6’2”, 195 pounder gave
all the credit for his running to
the offensive line and fullbacks.
“The offensive line was tremen-
dous,” he continued. “Ihave to

give most of the credit to the line‘

and the fullbacks Phil Sgrignoli
and Gary Cramer. They opened up
the holes and I just had to run

through them. There was room to

run out there.”

William and Mary came into Sa-
turday’s game with a defensive
unit ranked third in the nation,
but Ferris noted that the ranking
was misleading. “Perhaps they
were over-rated,” he explained.
“They really didn’t impress me
for being ranked third in the coun-
try. -

“Offensively speaking, we had
a lot more unity and spirit in the
huddle Saturday,” he continued.
“I don’t really know why, except
we’re tired of losing; we wanted
to redeem ourselves.” ‘

« Ferris also had praise for soph-
omore Dave Garnett, second team
tailback who picked up 39yards
in nine carries. "‘He’s a tremen-
dous tailback and he’s really push-
ing me. He did really well Satur-
day. It’s good when you have a

"couple of tailbacks and can keep

the guys fresh in there.”

This Saturday, the Panthers
face a tough Syracuse defense-
a defense which held UCLA to a
meager seven points last week.
Ferris is confident that his team
has a chance. “We’ll probably
have to rely more on passing
because they are really tough a-
gainst thesrun,” he figured, but
I think we’ll be able to move the
ball against them. Football is so
unpredictable, don’t count us
out.”

After all, last year a lot of peo-
ple had counted Denny Ferris
out.

Lose Opening Contest

Lack of game experience proved costly to the freshman soc-
cer team Saturday. Despite numerous scoring opportunities, the
booters were nipped by the Slippery Rock Frosh, 3-2

In their first contest of the season, the freshmen’s inconsistent pas-

sing deprived them of a victory. Instead of attempting to attack the
Rockets’ poorly guarded wings, the Frosh tried unsuccessfully to move

the ball through the middle.

Tony Nicholopoulos accounted
for the first goal early in the
third’ quarter. The other goal,
scored by Steve Shildt, came on a
rebound shot early in the final
stanza. Although the kickers had
many scoring chances in the final
few moments, they couldn’t
capitalize on any of them.

Although the squad gave up three
goals, the defense performed well
against the opposition. Tom Jones,
the middle fullback, broke up se-
eral threats on goal, while the
frosh goalie made several fine
saves to anchor the booter’s de-
fense. A

Next Saturday, the frosh meet
the Johnstown freshmen in their

son. The passing was at its best, the shooting was hard, and for the most"

part, on target.

Play after play, the booters
were on the ball, breaking up al-
most every chance the Rockets
could find’. ‘

Goalie Len Harmon, who got his

first shut—out since the Kent State '

game last fall, had one of his eas-
iest games. He had to make only
three saves to preserve his shut-
out.

The overpowering kicker of-
fense outshot the Rocket’s sur-
prisingly ineffective line 22 to
4.

“We just did what we were sup-
posed to do,” Bemis said.-.

He did add‘ one thing that he
thought was still a problem: “We-
’re still going to have’ to work
on getting the ball down.” ‘

The ball was up in the air a
bit, but not nearly as much as in
the first two losses. Also, it seem-
ed that the booters were getting
many of the heads.

The first goal of the year for
the kickers came in the second
period when Conference Lekoma
banged a head shot past goalie
Ron Boller, after the Rocket de-
fender had kicked out a similar
Pitt shot.

Lekoma was also in on the sec-
ond goal. He was charging to-
wards the net, with the goalie and
line in front of him. He pushed
the ball to the other side, sur-

enough in his position. Secondly
he declared, “I have the greatest
respect for Averill Harriman (U.
S. chief negotiator) but he can’t
negotiate . . . because he is as
deaf as a post.”

After his prepared speech, the
floor was opened for a half hour

. of questioning. Promising that “I

tell it like it is” Clark told one
questioner that he is in favor of
individual American contribu-

tions to the starving nation of Bia-

fra but against military interven-
tion.

Using a query about gun con-
trol which the Senator himself
favors, Clark took a swipe at his
November opponent, State Rep-
resentative Richard Schweiker by
producing a montage of newspa-
per headlines entitled “Schweik-
er’s Zig Zag Course on Gun Con-
trol” which showed the Mont-
gomery County representative’s
varying views on gun control.

Later taking a jab at the entire
GOP, Clark said, “The Republi-
can Party is the party of status
quo.”

Meeting Held to Formulate
Club Reorganization Plans

The Young Democrats held a campus reorganization meeting last

Thursday.

Dead for over a year on the campus, the Young Democrats organ- '
' ization sought immediate action for the group on matters of dues, im-
* mediate activities, and the organization’s purpose.

Young Democrat President John.Kerr emphasized that the group
,“will support no particular presidential candidate.” He pointed out
that two other groups, Students for Humphrey. and Students for Clark,

. do support candidates. .

There also was an indication by Kerr of a possible future debate

' r on campus sponsored by the Young Democrats between senatorial can-
V didates Joseph Clark and Richard Schweiker. Speechesby other noted
political figures will help to highlight the organization.

The next meeting will consist of the initial reading of the chapter

', constitution and a discussion of the speech that Georgia Representative
' _ Julian Bond will deliver tomorrow.

The next meeting will be held Thursday night at 7:30 in 426 SU.

Critchfield Wants Communication

ministration has respect for stu-
dents who speak out and are con-
cerned with the real problems and
has hope for those who have other
motives within student power.”
In addition, Critchfield feels that

the issues discussed and the en- V

tire student power movement is
an experience in “education out-
side of the classroom,” which he
feels is an “unqualified gain.”

In his analysis of the issue,
Critchfield said that the term
“Student Power” does not con-
note what is actually meant. “It
is interpreted by many as a ‘mill-
tant action’ which frightens off
those who would want to hear
what students have to say but fear
being on the offensive. This is a
problem of which students, fac-

A ulty, and administrators are all

guilty.”

The issue is deeply rooted by a
human cry for recognition. “It is
a desire to be a part of a system
that makes decisions. “This de-
sire for recognition and participa-
tion is what actually instigates
the Student Power movement ra-
ther than the ‘militant’ connota-
tion. It is a cry against deperson-
alization and a feeling of unim-
portance in the multitude of a
lecture hall, within a large uni-
versity. It is a cry against our
computer age with its student
numbers and invoices. It is
piercing the structure of the Uni-
versity with the very shrills of
discontent and insecurity.
