To Participate '
In Tournament

Eleventh Cross Exam
First US Tourney
For West Indians

Fifty—ﬁve « debating teams
from 18 states, the West In-
dies, and two Canadian prov-
inces will participate in the
eleventh annual Cross-Exam-
ination Debate Tournament

at the University on this ‘Friday
and Saturday.

The international tournament,
conducted by the William Pitt De-
bating Union, is one of the largest
of its kind in the United States.
All debating will be done on the
current intercollegiate topic, “Re-
solved: That the Further Develop-
ment of Nuclear Weapons Should
be Prohibited by International
Agreements.” ' ’

Theptournament marks the ﬁrst
participation of the‘ University
College of the West Indies in a
United States tournament. Uni-
versity debaters have visited the
West Indian college on two oc-
casions. ‘They will return to
Jamaca for a series of public de-
bates again this year.

The tournament will be a ﬁve-
round cross-exam meet. This is
more difficult than the‘. usual
orthodox style of debating since
cross-questioning is i included as
well as constructive speeches and
rebuttals.

Non Decision Tournament

No decisions will be given in the
tournament, but a judge will ‘give
each individual speaker a rating.
At the end of the tournament the
school with the highest total num-
ber of points will receive a per-
manent trophy.

Permanent trophies will also
be given to the top negative
and affirmative pairs, and
medals will be presented to the
.five most ‘outstanding speakers
in the tournament.

The debaters will register in the
Commons Room for two rounds of
debate to be held before dinner
Friday. ‘The remaining sessions

John Gooding, Arts ’62, stated
that he had read the letter in the

Gooding also said that SGA had
received no food complaints. Eric
Vanhove, Eng. ’60-, suggested that
such complaints be turned over

Dr. Shepherd L., Whitman, di-

have read ‘The Quiet American’

Education 0f Value » ‘

The chancellor in his report to guidance counselors‘ from re-—
gional schols clariﬁed’ his views on scholarships-loans for the fu-“
tureiand tuition for next year. _ I

Both these statements should be well-received by the student
body, always concerned about these topics. ’

This is deﬁnite indication that the Chancellor is aware_that
the students are paying their share, as he has said on many‘ occa-
sions. Students still irrationally believe that tuition was certain
to go up. ' ' -

The chancellor noted that a grant in aid program will be in
"effect next year. Loans have been increased by$200,000 and more
will be available next year. ; ' ’

i " Scholarships have been increased by $321,000 since 1956-57.
Of course, this is just a small inroad when it is considered _how much

One 9f the basic philosophical diﬂiculties in .discussions of

R scholarships and loans is whether it is to society’s ben'eﬁt.to ,pro- ~-
‘ vide the ‘funds for all qualiﬁed students to complete their -higher
education as is the case in Russia, or"-whether the student should

have an obligation to repay the funds.

It appears that the University of Pittsburgh policy on the sub-.
ject‘ will 'be.that the student repays in many cases. This is true of
many of fine universities in the~U.S. i

Students -value more those things‘for which they pay. Without
tuition, a college education would be merely an extension ‘of pub”.-.

Russia Gains As Well I-iaell-Out Negligible

By Tom Ribich
As the cold war drags into its fourteenth year,
few people. are claiming that the Western Powers
and the ‘Soviet Union are ‘coming any closer to

solvingtheir political differences. On the Asian and

European continents, ﬂareups seem to be increas-
ing, both in frequency and seri-   1 A ‘ '
ousness. Leaders continue to  "
demonstrate belligerance
war-like intentions. 
Inconsistent with the general if
tone of things, representatives at
Geneva from the United ‘States,
Britain, and . the Soviet Union
have been rationally and calmly
discussing the matter of stopping?
nuclear ' test‘ explosions.

and  .

Since for all intents and purposes, no true de-

‘ velopment can take placeﬁwithout experiment and
testing, a ban on nuclear tests would bring an end‘

to the further development and reﬁnement of nu-
clear weapons. — A

It will prevent the nuclear~powers (U. S., Brit-
ain, U. —S. S. R.) from making their bombs bigger,
faster, or more versatile. Moreover, it would block
other nations of the world from devising an effec-

* tive bomb of their own. --~

‘It appears that the world community has sev-
eral things to gain if such an agreement is reached.
The most important beneﬁt ,would be the probable
reduction of international tension. The nuclear
powers would‘ experience a sense of co-operation
and would certainly begin to appear less bellicose,
both in the eyes of each other and in the 'view
of the smaller nations. V . . V.

A ban on tests would make agreement on the
political issues more likely and might easily ,be a
spark to more comprehensive disarmament meas-
ures. e -
Elimination of-Fallout _

Other advantages include the elimination of
radioactive fallout which now threatens to increase
the rate of mutation and leukemia. \’ C U’ ,

Equally signiﬁcant would be the diversion of
nuclear scientists into needed industrial projects.

The question 'may now be asked: Will the stop-
ping of bomb development hurt the security of
the Western World?

Since there is now a balance of nuclear

strength, effective imutual dete_rence cancels out a

the .possibility of an all—out nuclear war. A freeze
on weapons development will secure this balance.

‘ Continued development, however, might result in

a rriajor technological breakthrough and would en-
courage the strongernation to initiate war. It_ can
be concluded that further development offers seri-
ous dangers foc the West if Russia is the nation to
secure such a breakthrough. " R

It should also be pointed. out that the United
States has numerous tactical weapons,
although further development might be helpful, it
certainly does not outvsfeigh the advantages of se-

-curity through a development freeze and the ulti-

mate security that could be: gained .if disarmament

,. were carried further.

Explosions\Detectab|e \ ’

This leaves the ﬁnal. problem of enforcement.
The summer conference in Geneva preached the
conclusion that all signiﬁcant explosions could be
detected and that the proposed detection system
had a very good chance of discovering even the
smallest blasts. .

It is the opinion here that Russia "has as much
to gain from an agreement as_ the West, in the
form of security, elimination of radiation hazard,
and ‘gains to industry.’ If - Russia, therefore,
caught in an attempt to cheat, this will not only
mean propaganda fodder for the West, but also
that the pact which, originally benefited Russia
will be dissolved. Through mutual beneﬁt, then,
the agreement will be enforceable.

By Gary _Hess

The increasing agitation for the cessation of
nuclea_r testing has centered around two argu-
ments: (l) the harmful effect of radioactive fall-
out and (2) the danger that the ir sibls
leader of —a small nation might _i' * i  “
be able to develop nuclear 
weapons. _

In advancing the radioactive
fall—out arguments, those who 0
favor the‘ afﬁrmative position A
tend to ignore the fact that such 
fal1—out as a result of nuclear
testing is extremely negligible. ‘ *

The National Academy ’ of 
Science, the British Medical Re— .. .. 
search Council, the Swiss Academy of Natural Sci-
ences, and ‘virtually all impartial surveys on the
question are’ in agreement that the amount of
radiation received by mankind as a result of nu-

 

   
   

 

fclear testing cannot be termed of sufficient import- _,

ance to warrant a change from thepresent practice.

"Clean Bomb" -Answer

Furthermore, I would hasten to add that even
the insigniﬁcant amount of radiation which does
now result from testing can be quite easily elimi-
nated through the continued perfection of a ‘‘clean
bomb” (our nation has a 95%
,already) or through simply taking the tests under-
ground which both Dr. Edward Teller and Dr.
agree would eliminate fall-out
altogether. A _‘ _

The second argument advanced is that if test-
ing continues‘, small nations might gain nuclear
knowledge. It is reasoned that if four, ﬁve or more
nations have nuclear bombs, the chances of a

' nuclear war are increased.

In answer to this argument, it must be pointed
out that even if an international agreement were
signed that would prohibit the future development
of nuclear’weapons, this would not in any way

‘eliminate the possibility that one of the nations

which have nuclear stockpiles will choose toshare
its nuclear weapons. _
Two years ago, John Foster Dulles stated it was
United States’ policy to shared nuclear\_knowledge
with our closest allies. There is a good chance that
Russia might chose_ to give nuclear weapons to
Communist China. — ’- ‘
In summation, I would submit that the affirma-
tive proposal _would_ prevent only one way that a
small nation could get ‘nuclear weapons. These
small nations could still obtain the weapons from
the major powers. '“ -

Importance to Security
It must be added to the arguments already pre-
sented that nuclear testing is important to the se-

“curity of the United States. The advocates of the

resolution often claim that ‘it,’ would ' be advan-
tageous for the United States to sign an agreement
at this time, because the United States leads the
Soviet Union in nuclear development."

It may, well" be true that “we do lead in ,the
large, thermonuclear bombs, but the United States
does not have’ a substantial lead, if a lead at all,
in small, tactical nuclear weapons. ‘ As General

Twining, the chairman ‘of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
- has stated, the only way for us to be certain of a

lead over Russia in tactical weapon development
is to continue testing and development.

Trust "Means Danger

Finally, there is the problem of apossible vio-
lation to such an agreement. What would be the
penalty against a nation who set off nuclear weap-
ons against the treaty regulations? Suppose‘ Russia

abiding by the treaty. It is obvious. that if we are
in a position of having to trust the Russians, we
will be in an extremely dangerous position.

Viewing Works of Art

WATSON R. Steenburgh, assistant professor of ﬁne arts, left, andVAnn Woolfolk, secretary, ad-

mire the woodcuts of Hungarian artist Jozsef Domjan. The woodcuts, subjects of which include folk
themes, ﬂowers and birds, are now on exhibit inthe Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Gallery on the
seventh ﬂoor, Cl. They will be there through Jan. 6, 1959.

Woodcuts by Hungarian

Displayed on 7th Floor

' An exhibition of color woodcuts by J ozsef Domjan,,Hun-
garian artist, is currently on display in the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Gallery on the -seventh ﬂoor.

Subjects include Hungarian folk themes, ﬂowers, and

birds, especially the peacock

motif. All of these are ren-

b dered with a unique sense of color and reﬂect Hungarian

folk art and embroidered cos-9

t,umes.
Domjan, a refugee of the Hun-
garian revolution, in escaping

sacriﬁced all his woodblocks, the
product of many years’ effort. He
and his family have accomplished
the woodcuts —on display in just
one year since their arrival in
New York on Aug. 31, 1957.

Last March, "Domjan had his

‘first American exhibition at the

Kennedy Galleries in_ New York
and won acclaim as a master of
the color woodcut. His work was
purchased by four _American mu-
seums, including the Metropolitan.
European Reputation
Although Domjan arrived in
America with only a few material
possessions, he brought with him
a European reputation as a mas-
ter of the color woodcut which
had spread as far as China, where
he has had several exhibitions.

Previously Domjan also had
many one-man exhibitions in
-European museums and galler-
ies. His prints have been in-
cluded in such important group-
exhibitions as the International
Color Woodcut Exhibition.

The essential attraction of the
woodcut for Domjan is that he
feels he can retain the purity of

his color better in this medium.
The thoroughness of Domjan’s
approach is seen in that he makes
his own colors and prints the
block with his thumb, a process
laborious and, at time painful.
To make up for the loss of
the woodblocks left in Buda- *
pest, Domjan has been working
up to eighteen hours a‘day to
prepare for his American exhi-
bitions. He does not use pre-
paratory sketches, but works
entirely on the woodblocks.

The exhibition will continue to
Jan. 6. It will be open from 9
a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays, 9-5 p.m.
Tuesdays through Fridays,'9 a.m.
to noon Saturdays.

Holiday Hours Set

University offices will be closed
on the following working days
during the holiday season in addi-
tion to Christmas day and New
Year's day; Dec. 24, 26, 27, and

Howarth to Indicate
Beat Positive Side

By LORRAINE LESOON
“A Reply to My Friend Professor Culver, in Defense of
the Beat Generation” is the title of the lecture that Herbert
Howarth of the English department will deliver to the In-
quiry Club this Friday at noon in G24 Cl.
“Monty Culver is a very wise and sound man and I shan’t
try to refute the points he made but merely try td show

the positive side of the Beat Gen-6

eration by showing their sense of
beauty for the’ world and for
America and how they are at-
tempting to become the ideal
saint.”

Professor Culver recently spoke
to the Inquiry Club and to women
of the Breckenridge House on the
Beat Generation. He stated that
they are solely keepers of them-
selves and are possessed with what
Culver called a “horrifying self-
absorption.” '

“Culver who is well versed on
“Beat” literature feels that if
the Beats would do something
that ‘would give them pleasure
instead of merely showing con-
tempt for materialistic society,
their contribution would be far
greater. "
“Instead of becoming cool with

marijuana,” he said, “perhaps they
could have real visions of beauty
and truth from something like
reading great poetry. "

Howarth in his lecture this Fri-

day shall attempt to illustrate the
awareness of beauty that exists in
the beats along with their struggle.
tobe ideal persons.

Concerning the other points
of his lecture Howarth added,
“I shan’t be sure of all of them
until ﬁve minutes before ,noon
on Friday.”

After one enthusiastic engirieer

learned that Howarth would be

speaking this Friday about the:

Hennon Scores;
Slobbo Rebounds

By MURRAY CHASSJ

A few years ago no sports fan in the city questioned the

the years when Dudey Moore was considered one of the top
coaches in the nationand when Moore had such hardwood
virtuoses as Dick Ricketts, Jim Tucker, and Sihugo Green.

During that recent span, as now, the Carnegie Tech quin-
tets were not the ones to challenge this supremacy. And, for
that matter, neither were our own heroes, the Panthers. That
is, they couldn’t do anything to change the status until the-
money ball player, little Don Hennon, of Wampum, matricu-
lated at Pitt. . ‘ ., '

It so happened that Hennon got his ﬁrst varsity crack at
the Dukes the year after’ Sihugo left the bluff for the profes-

thers stopped the kings of the local courts and claimed the

throne. ‘ ' .
Even with the 5-81/2 All-American, though, Bob Tim-

mons’ ﬁve was knocked back out of that hierarchial position

This marked the third time in four that the Bluffites
battled the Panthers in a Bowl ﬁnal and won. \
‘ Stating it simply, the tussle could turn into" a contest of
the biblical David and Goliath variety. For the Panthers, of
course, the key is Hennon. In the two games thus far, Hen-
npn has scored 69 points, good for 53.9 per cent of the team’s
total points. If Hennon is “on” and can solve the Dukes’ tight
defense, the Panthers may make it no contest. A

At the opposite end of the court, however, is a 6-9 center,
Bob Slobodnik. Slobbo, a 220-pound sophomore, played fresh-
man ball for the Dukes but found" the academic side of col-.
lege too rough. He’s now found the range in that ﬁeld and
Red Manning, the head coach of the Dukes, is working on him
so that he may ﬁnd the range from the foul lane and there-
abouts.

We say that Slobbo may make the difference not because
of his talent and the magnetic charm he has to the hoop, but
because at 6-9 he‘ stretches three inches above the tallest
Panther regular. Sawyer, and four, inches ‘above the next

nounds than Mills, 30 more than Sawyer, and 35 more than
Fridley. I - ' -

It'is apparent then, that with Slobodnik roving around
under the boards, the Panthers could have a hard time get-
ting rebounds. Manning himself may have given Pitt the
strategy that could beat the big man. ’ .

Against St, Francis last Saturday night Manning stoppe
the F1"“{lkl€S’ top rebounder Wilbur Trosch, from snaring too
many shots by sending Slobodnik down the ﬂoor immediately
after a shot was taken. This forced Trosch to go‘ after him,
leaving the boards to -the smaller men. And so it could be
done against .Slobbo. - . 2 .

The game last Saturday showed a lot more about the
once—powerful Dukes. Their two backcourt men who do most
of the ball handling are Red Ryan and Bernie Mathews. They
bring the ball up court and do most of the playmaking with
help from_Brown. Mathews, however, chooses to throw the

If he is hitting, he can be almostas dangerous from the
outside as Hennon. But against the Frankiés he scored only
six of 24 attempts from the ﬁeld. Ryan and Mathews also play
an all-court pressing type of defense after the Dukes score.

The Dukes’ ﬁfth man may just as well stand on the cor-
ner of Forbes and Murray during the game, a favorite ex-.
pression of a former local city high school coach, for all the

the 58-56 loss to St. Francis and stayed mostly in either of
the corners, usually alternating with Slobodnik. . .

Now that we have etched a pretty frail ﬁgure of the once
high and mighty Duquesne Duke, let’s take a brief look at
Pitt without Hennon. Mills appears to be the strongest board
man for the Panthers, but he has a long way to go on his of-
fensjve play. Sawyer still ﬁnds it difficult to control the ball
both in passing and receiving and commits too many unnec-
essarv personal fouls. ‘ ‘ . .

The two bright rays streaking up and down the Field

House ﬂoor seem to be a pair of sophomores, Fridley and Dick
Falenski. Each has an otitstanding point about him. Fridley
has an amazing defensive touch for blocking opponents’ shots.
In two gameslhe has halted about 1_7 shots before they had a
chance to” reach thebasket. ,
, Falenski, a surprise starter against the Buskeyes, showed
good playmaking ability and an extra amount of hustle. The
Derry Twp, hoopster deﬁnitely could replace Hennon as the
Paritherskgo-man when the current go-man goes. . "

As far as city supremacy in basketball goes, then, it
shapes.up as a battle between Don~Hennon’s scoring and Bob
Slobodnik’s rebounding. The Dukes undoubtedly_wi1l ﬁnd
subduing the ambidextfous Hennon much tougher than. the

of action if the Dukes can get to

Slobodnik, who has been dub-

also registered over 30 points

weekend. Oddsmakers have listed the

Jungle Cats as the

Skyscraper»U., as has been‘ the case since he came to

school from Wampum, is led byé

second and third units from day
to day. _ ‘

Running on the second unit at
last night's practice were Francis

John Mesher (6-1) from Donora,
,Nick*Sutya.k (6-3) from, Phoenix-
ville, Lloyd Simpson (6-1) from

Shay (5-11) from Levittown, N.
Y., Paul Lazor (6-4) from Can-
onsburg, and Ron Maser (6-3)
from McKeesport. _
Ditka ‘is the same person who
played left end for « John
Michelosen’s football squad.
“Mike played a” lot of good ball
for the freshmen team last year
and should help us immensely
around the boards this season,"
-declared the Blue and Gold
' tutor.
“Simpson,” he added, “might
have started in Falenski’s place

in the lineup against Ohio State u.

but for the fact that he was in-
jured in the Michigan encounter

and was not able to dress for the_

Buckeye game.”

dition of the Blue and Gold squad
that hopes to better last year’s
18-7 record and gain a third con-

Terrapins Strong in Freestyle, Diving

Tankers Open Year

CW/ith Ma rylandi

Five Seniors Back to Better Eastern Standing;
Grady Sees “All-round, Well-balartced Team”

The Panther mermen will open their season Saturday
when they travel to College Park, Md., for their meet with

the University of Maryland.

The team, under Coach Ben

Grady, will be trying for a repeat performance of last year’s
contest when they splashed their way_to‘a 46-40 victory.
The Maryland team, which boasts eight lettermen, last

year had a "7-5 season, and weie¢ ,.

third in the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference. The team in addition car-
ries seven sophomores. Maryland
with Jim Park, Bob Mills, Ralph
Sinclair, and Ted Geath will be
strong in the 220 and 440-yd. free-

Nan Cooper

style events and especially strong

in diving with Dick Cole.

The Panther tankers .will
have ﬁve seniors on the team
this season: Willis Weisz, back-
stroke champion; Lee Engdahls
freestyle; Dale Mapstone, free-
style;‘ Lou Durbin, freestyle;
Ken’ Cooper, ifreestyle; and
Chuck Nanz,- - breaststroke;
Cooper and Nanz are the co-
captains of the Panther - team.

Pat Fitzgerald, a junior free-
styler, won two events, the 220
and 440-yard freestyle,‘ in last
year’s meet against the Terrapins.

Other Panther mermen are Len
Paganini and Tom Sarsﬁeld, free-
stylers who are prospective 220
and 440 competitors. Howard
Tresser, Bob Zealos, Barry Kent,
Jim Emert, and Bert’ Haas will be
competing in the freestyle events,
and Kevin Keller and Gerald
Irwin are slated for the diving
events. "

“We have a good all-around,
team, one that is well balanced
and should be able to _hold its
own. We have an up and com-
ing organization that will give
keen competition,” Coach Grady
said. 9 _

The Panther mermen had a .500
season last year but came through
to place second in the Eastern
championships. ‘

Frosh Hoopsters
Play Youngstown

The Panther freshmen travel to
Youngstown today where they will
meet an undefeated Youngstown
JV team. Coach Carl"-Peterson re-
ports that the Youngstown hoop-
sters are big and good as usual,
and that he cannot remember the
last time Youngstown was defeat-
ed on its home floor.

The cubs have been using a
pressing type defense and a give-
and-go offense which is basically

the same as the varsity offense-

The starting ﬁve will be the
same as against Bethany: Dick
Sankey, Joe Schnetzki, Ralph
Schutterly, Bob Segal, and Ken
Hepworth.

“They are hard working, ambi-
tious, and never loaf. Any time-a
team works and puts out they are
bound to improve, as I believe
this team will,” Peterson said,
summing up the spirit and drive
of the team.
