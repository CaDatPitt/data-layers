“Hello Again,” Student-Written, All-Male

Opens At Nixon Theater Thursday Night

Sewickley Beach In 1909 Hailed
As Outstanding Scene In
Cap-Gown Revue

Thursday night “Hello Again" 8098
on at the Nixon theater, for a stand

totalling three nights and one
matinee.
Yesterday a somewhat shortened

production was pre-
sented before the Shriners at the
Syria Mosque, after the ﬁnal re-
hearsal had “clicl\'ed" at the Mosque
on Sunday afternoon.

The latest of the annual Cap and
Gown musical efforts, this year’s

show is the ﬁrst student-written af-
fair in the history of Pitt’s all-male
revues. Although previous produc-

version of the

tions have included 100 per cent un-,

dergraduate casts, the writing of
story, lines, and music has been left
to graduate members of the organi-
zation.

“This year,” says Director VVilliam
Marlatt, "we’re trying a revue instead
of a ‘plot’ show. Altogether, we’re

using twelve separate skits whose]

only link with each other will be the
student cast. There are plenty of
musical numbers, and one at least—
I won't say which——is going to be
something of a hit_ Our scenes will
shift from China to Sewickly Beach
on a 1909 Fourth of July, and our cos-
tumes, which we have imported from
New York, are the most elaborate we
have ever used.”

Returning from the 1933 "All to the
Point” will be Bernard Rosenson, BA
34, Carl Swartz, C34, Norman Vvolken,
C34, John Wyeth, C35, Russell Con-
nolly, C35, Joseph Samson, Ed35,
Marshall Baker, BA35, Ray McCune,
E34, Robert Haase, E35, Joseph Let-
tereillo, C36, and Richard Ohi, C35.

Every year usually means some
sort of record for Cap and Gown, and
this season the surprise comes in the
form of a huge chorus, “the largest
in history." Along with the ﬁfteen
or more in the cast, and usual number
in the octette, and the specialty
dancers, the chorus members will
combine to make “Hello Again” the
largest show of them all.

R WD Authority Pushes
Cathedral Construction

The RWD will continue the work of
the CWA on the Cathedral of Learn-
ing until April 30.

The new authority will continue in
the same manner as the discontinued
agency and will not effect the number
of men employed. However, there,
may be some reduction in the numberg
of men working after the state au-§
thorities check up on the eligibility of}
the workmen.

There is plenty of material on handi
for the workmen to use according to
John G. Weber, business manager of
the University. There are about 26
carloads of stone to be unloaded by
today. ,

Scaffolding on the Belleﬁeld avenue
side of the Cathedral will soon be

completed. After the scaffolding is
torn down, the carving of small ﬁg-
ures on the lower part of the tall
building will commence. The main
entrance, that on Bigelow boulevard.
will be ﬁnished in three or four
weeks.

Sales Tax Worth
Will Be Debated

Inquiry Club To Hear Business
Men Tomorrow At Meeting

Whether the sales tax is a good

I one or not will be debated by George

E. Evans and Major E. Lowry Humes
at tomorrow afternoon's Inquiry club

meeting in Room 315, Alumni hall, at,

12:30 o’clock. Mr, Evans will oppose
the sales tax and Mr. Humes will sup-

port the issue.
The sales tax has received much

a, means for states and the national

government to balance their budgets.
Mr. Evans will attack the sales tax
on two points, ﬁrst from the view of
the consumer and second, on the com-
plications resulting from the collec-
tion of the tax.

“The sales tax is heaviest upon the
consumer and really amounts to a
tax on the consuming power of the
low wage earners. The manufacturer
does not pay the tax but merely pass-
es it on to the consumer,” said Evans.
On the collection of the sales tax, he
will present the difficulties of its ad-
ministration in its assessment and
collection.

Beneath

First Floor As Blacksmiths Bend Over Hot

Flames To Shape Building’s Works of Steel

 

Picturesque, Romantic View
Of Cathedral Work
Is Presented

   

First of a series of articles concerned
with Cathedral construction work,

By John Hesselbein

One story below the ground ﬂoor
of the future world's greatest Univer-
sity building. in a little out-of—the-
way passageway near what will
someday be an underground balcony,
is one of the busiest workshops in the
Cathedral, a, blacksmith shop.

Hidden away below the ground
ﬂoor, it is much like the secret work-
shops of the dwarfs in traditional
fairy tales. Approaching from a dis-
tance, you ﬁrst become aware of the
constant clanging of hammers on
iron and steel. The light is dim and
eerie, and the air of the passageway

 

cool and damp. The dampness pene-

trates to your skin, and you shiver
unconsciously. Stone walls that line
the passageway are a. ‘bit darker from
the smoke that ﬁlters out, and the
concrete ceiling is black from it.
You turn a corner, then you see it——
a. complete underground smithy. Two
huge forges and anvils, half a dozen
power-driven grindstones, and a pow-
erful steel drill press are in the room,
which is ﬁfteen feet wide and ex-
tends back perhaps twenty-ﬁve feet. I
Blacksmiths are constantly busyl
there. Deftly and skillfully they
wield the various tongs native to their
trade. As you watch them they
seem to speed up their work, and the
hissing of hot steel in water increases.
What do they do? They sharpen
all sorts of tools, day in and day out,
and bend red hot metal into queer
little gadgets that are religiously
piled beside their anvils. From there
they are collected at various intervals
by men who come, examine quietly,
then take them away. And there is
so much of this sort of work to be

Dim Light, Dampness Add
To Dwarflike Mien
Of Novel Smithy

done all the time that construction
engineers considered it advisable to

install a Smithy right in the building '

rather than send the stud out to be
repaired.

Nestled into one of the far reaches
of the Cathedral, it presents a pic-
turesque and somewhat romantic view
of Cathedral construction, and strikes
an unharmonlous chord of noise below
the level of the city streets.

Do the men look like dwarfs? Hard-
ly. They are strong men, wielding
hammers with the vigor of young
men, but smiling at you throughl
brown-singed mustaches and dirt-
sprayed faces from which sweat rolls

and drops, at times, onto hot metal
where it disappears with a sudden

spat.

Nominating Committee Meets
To Name Candidates For
Thirty Positions

Vvith 67 petitions submitted to the
dean of men, with faculty recom-
mendations now before the nominat-
ing committee, and with still other
names proposed by members of the
committee itself, selection of nomi-
nees for the new Student-Faculty as-
sociation of the University will be
completed before the end of the week.
_ The ﬁrst nominating committee
wmeeting in the dean of men’s office
yesterday afternoon resulted in con-
sideration of candidates’ eligibility,
and additions to the ﬁrst list of would-
be assemblymen. Several students
who had not petitioned for the of-
fices appeared before the group, giv-
ing their reasons for desiring the
posts and stating their qualiﬁcations.

It is believed that the Pitt News
will be able to publish on Friday of
this week the names of the forty
men and women who are to be nomi-
nated. The committee has planned
several sessions before Thursday, so
,that all details of the election can
‘be arranged before the voting next
week.

According to reliable reports, an
elaborate elections system is being
drawn up to preclude the possibility
of repeat voting, presentation of “doc-
tored” registration cards, and all the
other evils formerly associated with
University balloting. Students will
be permitted to vote on one of at
ileast three days, and will select only
four candidates from the two-score on
the ballot_

Undergraduate interest in the new
government plan, evidenced by the
record-breaking number . of -petitions
submitted and by the widespread dis-
cussion regarding the proposed body,
is at the proverbial fever heat.

Mayor McNair Sees Red

N THESE DAYS of VVirt, Hamilton Fish, and
The Saturday Evening Post we might -expect
anything. V\7hile VVashington dowagers, pink-
cheeked senators from the \Vest, and hungry col-
umnists swarm at the “debut” of the Soviet em-
bassy, people from \Virt to l\IcNair delight in the
refreshing, though somewhat stilted, pastime of
Red—baiting. In VVashington, it is Rex Tugwell, a
brilliant economist. At Pitt, it is Dr. Hovde, a
brilliant historian. And a “crusading” mayor,
who has just discovered he is a member of the
University ’s board of trustees, declares that, in ad-
dition to Dr. Hovde, ﬁfty per cent of Pitt profes-
sors are communists. Yea, verily, the embalmed
corpse of Lenin doth turn uneasily in its sepulchre!

Sad would be the future of these dear United
States had we not real patriots like our crusading
mayor and the Soviet-deluded Dr. Wirt. Never
shall be trampled in the cobble-stone streets of
Pittsburgh the noble traditions of high interest,
over—capitalization, Americanism, and (everbody
stand up) economic rent. And any professor at
Pitt who dares mention Karl Marx, realization of
surplus value," or other equally nefarious “com-
munist” phrases shall be attired in red-striped
trousers and made to sing The Internationale on
the steps of city hall.

E CANNOT BELIEVE that ﬁfty per cent

of our professors are communists. VVe se-
riously doubt whether one-tenth of one per cent
bear that label. You cannot have that many good
communists in a school without the secret having
popped out before. Communists have one thing in
common with Mayor McNair—-they, too, are out-
spoken.

To the 1na.yor’s probable disillusionment, we
might mention that the halls of the University
bear not one stigma of red, Pitt professors do not
wear long, black beards, and perfectly good capi-
talist courses from History of Religion to a “pa-
triot” History of the United States are still hold-
ing forth. I11 addition, Pitt students still pay
three and ﬁve dollars for dance tickets, join frater-
nities, and attend football games——all purely harm-
less capitalist customs. The professors themselves
own their own Fords, a half dozen pairs of socks,
two collars, and a respectable mortgage on their
ﬁve-room bungalows. This marks them deﬁnitely
bourgeois.

E AREN’T being VVirtish or McNairish

when we reveal that some Pitt students
can intelligently discuss Mr. Marx and his theories,
can identify Stalin and Trotzky in a mob, and
know the difference between the First and Third
Internationales. But neither these students nor the
professors who teach them can be correctly label-
cc “communists.” Many people know the Bible
without being preachers, others know literature
without being writers, and still more know Pitts-
burgh politics yet have never been in a campaign
nor have been blessed by the shadows of Council ’s
chambers.

We really would not like you to “ﬁre” Dr.
Hovde, Mr. McNair. He is too good an historian.
And among the other 500 “communist” Pitt pro-
fessors please do not “ﬁre” our excellent econo-
mists, political scientists, zoologists, dentists, phy-
sicians, sociologists, and engineers. It is too far-
fetched a premise to assume that our zoologists
teach the sex habits of Rana. pipiens (frog, to you)
with a communist tinge. And imagine performing
an apendectomy muttering “down with capital-
ism,” or pulling a stubborn molar while thinking
in terms of class struggle and the rise of the prole-
tariat.

The Independent Vote Counts

N THE APPROACHING campus elections, the
determining factor will be the vote of the large
mass of unafﬁliated, independent students. These
students must assert their rights at the polls and
must elect representatives of their own choosing to
represent them on the newly-created Student-
Faculty association of the University.

Sixty-seven petitions were signed and presented
to the office of the dean of men by students, un-
affiliated and otherwise, who want one of the thirty
seats in the University assembly. This unprece-
dented interest speaks well for the future of the
new governmental setup which we consider an im-
portant step forward in Pitt student affairs.

OWEVER, indications show that the organ-

ized minority which has controlled govern-
mental aﬁairs on the campus for many years will
not supinely relinquish its hold. Furthermore, it
will ﬁght to re-establish itself as the dominant po-
litical factor on this campus. If such an event
shall come to pass we shall feel that our constant
combat in the interests of the mass of students on
the campus has been of little avail.

The best and only the best students on the
campus should be on the University assembly. I-Ve
have hoped that cliques and political parties would
be forgotten on the campus and concentration
would be upon the most ﬁt and most trustworthy
students, whether they be fraternity, coalition,
non-fraternity, Catholic, Protestant, white, negro,
or anything else. This should be the aim of Pitt
students for the future. Today, we must concen-
trate on doing the best we can in that direction
under present campus circumstances.

T IS IMPORTANT that Pitt ’s outstanding stu-
dents be elected to the University assembly.
Everyone is free to appear before the nominating
committee and present any student whom he con-
siders worthy of a seat in Pitt’s new governing
group. \Ve might suggest here, too, that activity
point ratings be disregarded in naming students
to the assembly. No student should be kept off
the group because he has fulﬁlled his quota of ac-
tivity points. It is important, too, that several
things happen in the approaching election:

1. Every student on the campus should vote.
He should vote his own registration card and reg-
ister his personal choice whether he is affiliated or
not.

2. The leading students on the campus should
be elected to the University assembly which next
year, in its debut, will face its most trying period
on the campus.

.3. Students who are in campus activities and
are unafﬁliated should support the nominee who
represents their activity. This will eliminate
doubling-up on candidates.

4. The general student body should make itself
acquainted with the political situation as it has
existed on the campus in the past and should, by
its vote, seek to eliminate such a. political state of
affairs.

5. Every voter should have the welfare of the
University, not of any small, particular group in
mind while he votes.

This Fraternity Business

GRACIOUSLY, Mr, Willison, newly-elected president
in the much-disputed Interfraternity council elec-
tions, answered a recent editorial in this paper. Our edi-
torial asked the question whether or not fraternities be-
long at Pitt, or at any other school. The present edito-
rial is not an answer to Mr. Wi1lison’s letter; it is rather
a continuation of the discussion about fraternities which
our ﬁrst writing started.

One outstanding fact, regardless of all others, becomes
more and more apparent to us in this connection. Indis-
putably, the University is a metropolitan university. It
draws its students from an area of small business men,
workers, farmers. Few aresthe students at Pitt whose
families are wealthy.

M OST STUDENTS who attend the University have to

scrape pennies to do so. It is not an exaggeration
to sa.y that ﬁfty per cent of the student body either
brings its lunch to school or doesn’t eat lunch. And it
is not an exaggeration, further, to say that only ﬁfty per
cent of the necessary textbooks are purchased on the
campus. Every drift in business, however small, affects
the pocketbooks of a section of Pitt students. Pitt’s stu-
dent body is largely “proletarian,” to use a ﬁtting phrase,
and fraternities are luxuries which members of the “pro-
letariat” cannot afford.

There is, however, a small section of the student group
which is able, by devious means, to raise enough money
to "belong to a fraternity. Even these students often ﬁnd
it difficult to keep their ﬁnancial affairs straight, as the
treasurer’s books in any fraternity will readily testify.
THUS, A SMALL section of the University's student

body, by scraping, can join fraternities. The ma-
jority has diﬂiculty even in meeting tuition. Four out of
every ﬁve students on the campus were aided by notes
to meet their tuition, the office. of Mr. Weber reported
last year. This year the percentage is the same, if not
higher.

A group of students, ably concentrated in a small
group, manages to create certain unwholesome political
and social situations at the University. The boy or girl
who must leave when classes are over to work over a
drug counter or in a. grocery store to make expenses
should not be left out of the campus political picture.
Fraternities have been able to create a division among
Pitt students, not because most of the students have
been disinterested, but because most of them have to
work their way through school.

N THIS MANNER, there is a needless division in the

ranks of the student body, a division which need not
exist. The Oakland district is not only not unwhole-
some, but considerably above the average in Pittsburgh
in the housing conditions it can offer to the very small
group of out-of-town students who have come to Pitt.

Baconian Theory Of Shakespeare’s Work -
ls Advanced By Head Of Chemical Group
Afte1_'_l\_/_l;any Years Of Intensive Research

Dr. Charles Skeele Palmer Gives’
Scientislfs Views Upholding
The Baconian Theory

Editor’s Note: The following article by Dr. Charles
Skeele Palmer, chairman-elect of the Pittsburgh Branch
of the American Chemical Society and former fellow of
the Mellon Institute, is presented by the Pitt News as a
scientist's support of the Baconian theory.

Dr. Palmer is a noted intellectual, being the inventor
of the basic method of cracking oil to gasoline in 1899,
and president of the Colorado School of Mines in 1902.
Dr. Palmer was a fellow of Mellon Institute in 1915-17
and has served as associate editor of the “Engineering
and Mining Journal.”

For many years Dr. Palmer has conducted considera-
ble research into the Baconian Theory. The Pitt News
presents here a short sketch of his support of the theory.

HE COMMONLY accepted view is that what we call

“The Shakespeare Plays and Poems” were written by
one William Shakespeare, of Stratford, England; he was
a real man—no mere myth——but all that we know about
him can be written on the palm of the hand; and even
that little has to do mostly with some business papers.

The new, and coming view, is that the “Shakespeare
Plays and Poems” were written by Lord Francis Bacon,
Baron of Verula.m.

Most of us, who know of the plays, only by the occa-
sional reading of some few of them——or by the rather in-
frequent exhibition of them at the theater-—will say:
“What difference does it make? We have the plays.
Who cares who wrote them?”

But the earnest student of Shakespeare wants to know
just what are the FACTS—and how these facts should
be properly used. '

In some of the early editions of the poems, the name is
hyphenated, thus: “SHAKE-SPEARS,” which is signiﬁ-
cant for it might refer to the Pallas-Athena idea; and the
name “William” was a nickname for a “poet” in those
days; and thus the two seem to mean “Poet-Teacher.”

Now, it is rather unfortunate that most of our teachers
of English Literature, in high school, college, or even
university, give no serious attention to the subject, usu-
ally dismissing it all with a smile of patronizing and be-
wildering contempt. VVHY? Simply because they have
been taught that there is no serious trouble in ascribing
the plays and poems to the Stratford man; and with all
this, there has accumulated a curious and spurious read-
ing-into that life, a mass of fancies taken from the plays
and poems.

Probably the chief reason for this strange misplay and
ignoring of real facts is due to Ben Jonson himself,
who, in that cryptic and double-faced dedicatory poem
published in the 1623 Folio, gives this reference to the
author:

“And though thou hadst small Latino and lesse
C-reeke,” and the words in black faced type are as given
in my photographic copy of the 1623 Folio.

And so it happens that most of our English students
and teachers have blindly followed that seemingly hon-
est statement, as to the learning of the real author. But,
to those of us who know our Shakespeare, that is not so
evident; for we do ﬁnd, and on almost every page, such
an abundance of classical learning (and the classics were
about all they had in that day), so much Home-ric word-
phrasing—such a. constant use of Latinisms (and with so
much real Baconian philosophy and psychology), in short,
so much of erudition, that we are forced to guess that
there must be some hidden meaning under those appa-
rently condemnatory words: “Hadst small Latino and
lesse Greek.” Apparently Ben Jonson had to say some-
thing that would, on the surface apply well to the repu-
tation of the Stratford man, and yet, under the surface,
would apply well to the marvelously sound and varied
learning of the real author.

The trick (and it is a trick, and then some) of the
word-play seems to be found in the ambiguity of the
plausible “hadst,” which really means “regard” or
‘‘hold;’’ as when the Bible says (Psalm 2: 4):

“He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh;
The Lord shall have them in derision.”

And that begins to open our eyes; as we see the new
interpretation,.that what the real author really did, was
to over-ride somewhat the Latin standards of play writ-
ing, and those of the Greek, still more; and the real
Shakespeare did it in two startling ways—very startling
from old-fashioned standards:

1. «The taking of all sorts of liberties with what they
called “The unities” of time and place (that is, all the
play had to happen at one time and place——and past his-
tory had to be narrated—any future had to be prophe-
sied. (Shakespeare is always apologizing for this, as in
the “Histories.”)

2. In mingling, in the same piece, both pathos and
humor, or tragedy and comedy Plato narrates (“Sympo-
sium”) that Socrates thought it the most comic and ab-
surd thing to be conceived——the funnest funny story ever.

And with that bugbear out of the way, we are free to
let the natural light of facts show us what has been long
ignored—the perfectly amazing mass of learning that
simply crams every page; and the still greater wonder
of it all, is that it is usually hidden under some ﬁne
poetic or dramatic phrasing or action, which lets us go
right on, without being bored with the abundant high-
brow stuff, which is the real basis of the pla.y a.nd poem.
Also, it appears that the whole is saturated with most

T THE MOMENT, especially with the recent publica-
A tion of an editorial by Paul Block, the criticisms of
opponents of Mr. Roosevelt’s New Deal are aimed at the
harmless and powerless “brain trust,” a group of intel-

ligent, educated young men who are advising the Presi-
dent. The conservative press of the nation (perhaps we
should say “reactionary press”) has pounced upon these
poor, unsuspecting teachers and begins to rip them apart,
for reasons that are only too obvious.

Opposition to four of the President’s legislative meas-
ures, the Stock Market Bill, the Tugwell Bill, the ‘Nag-
ner Bill, and the Securities Act, is aimed at the “brain
trust.” The opponents of the New Deal dare not aim at
the President. He is too popular at the present time.

One year from the present time, as business condi-
tions grow steadily better, the opposition to the New
Deal will come out in the open against the one and only
real New Dealer, President Roosevelt. At the moment,
let the “brain trust” be the goat. Big business is ﬁnally

profound Baconian philosophy and psychology—all of
which is most cunningly and ‘irtistically concealed.
There is the constant use of the Baconian ﬁgure of
speech———which we may call “the Vital, or Human, or‘
Love, or Marriage Metaphor.” There is the constant
Baconian use of “Nature, Fortune and Art,” as the chief
factors in shaping and controlling human experience.
The constant reference to Homer, in trying to imitate his
wonderfully descriptive adjectives, by hyphenated Eng-
lish words, as:

“The always-wind-obeying deep” (Comedy of Errors).

Then we might mention that strange. “N orthumber1and—
Mouse Manuscript,” or “The Promus,” a collection of‘
hundreds of poetical quotations from all the languages
of western Europe, most of which are actually used in
the plays. Either of these ﬁnds would have given the-
authorship to Bacon, if the ﬁeld had been vacant and the
plays anonymous. Then there are those curious “Men-
denhall curves,” of the number of words of varying let-
ters from one to ten-or-twelve, showing that the Bacon
curve is identical in shape with the “Shakespeare” curve,
only removed a bit forward, because in his prose works
he used longer words than in his poetry. And the Mar-
lowe curve (Marlowe, Peele and Greene were the “scrap-
heap” where the young writer got his training), this
curve is identical with the “Shakespeare” curve. This
promising ﬁeld has been only touched, but it is interest-
ing.

Then there is the “cypher,” and some day the name.
of Mrs. Gallup of Detroit will be as well known in Amer-
ica, as is that of Madame Curie in France and Poland.
This tells the whole story, as it is the real scientiﬁc
basis of the whole question, and it joins on with the old
and the always open evidence, of the mass of similar
subjects, that both Bacon and Shakespeare treat, fre-
quently with the same metaphor, with the same concepts,
and with almost the same words. The Cypher tells what.
makes necessary the re-writing of the whole Elizabethan
period; and ﬁnest of all with the cypher goes a. ﬁne para-
phrase translation of Homer, with one book (the fourth
of the Iliad) done in magniﬁcent iambic pentameter——I
have compared it with all the translations in the Harvard
Library, and it surpasses them all in directness and
beauty. This is easily the greatest literary ﬁnd of the
19th century, but is ignored by Greek scholars. Vvake
up you Greek Profs. who fear that Greek is, or ever will
be, a “dead“ language. And so we might go on indeﬁn-
itely. '

The whole trouble is that people who are supposed to
know their Bacon and Shakespeare; do not know them
(Mrs. Palmer and I used to read all of our Bacon and
Shakespeare, every year, and for many years). Recently
one of my friends, one of the best-read students of liter-
ature that I have met in the city, asked me why Bacon
had no humor or fun, like that in the plays? Of course
Bacon could not use humor in his serious writings; but
my friend had never heard of Bacon’s “Apothegms,” his
three sets of short funny stories; and Ben Jonson says
of Bacon that he was a most brilliant speaker, but found
trouble in “avoiding or passing-by a jest.”

Then there is that wonderful set of Bacon’s “Letters,”
and if you read them you will feel as though you had
been spending an evening with Shakespeare in business
and politics, for there he shows both wit and wisdom.

It is interesting to know that this almost-super-man
could make some of the most surprising blunders, and in
both Bacon and Shakespeare, in his Novum Organon, as
when he assumes that the center of the earth is the cen-
ter of the universe; and the ﬁndings of Copernicus, and
Kepler, and of Galileo, were well known by the end of
the 16th century.

But, as one of my candid friends says: “I ﬁnd that it
will take time to change my mind, even after I begin
to see the facts, for what impresses me is the vast
amount of new evidence that seems both new and true.”
It may be interesting to know that, within a quarter of a
mile of Pitt, there is stored all the fundamental books of
Bacon on the cypher, so that those who want to know
may do so.

But, we come back to the original question, WHY DID
BACON HIDE IT ALL? Firstly, because play-writing
and acting was not in good standing in that day.
ondly, because it would have seriously interfered with
Bacon’s political standing, and thirdly, and this IS im-
portant: Because several of the plays were “treasona-
ble,” as Richard second—and there was a cruel “Star
Chamber” in those days. But this danger was much
slighter for an unknown nobody like the Stratford man.
And lastly, why do not our English teachers know of all
this? Answer: Public prejudice. One of my Boston
friends, himself a Harvard trustee, told me (and he was
an intelligent Baconian) that he had no doubt that any
young assistant in English who was suspected of this
“heresy.,” would be promptly ﬁred from his position.
Why then are such people as the writer allowed to speak
out plainly? Simply be-cause, just at present it is only
the scientiﬁc student who is a “free 1ance.”

And, as a last word, notice this, you young students,
who pride yourselves on looking at the future, I know of
no subject so well calculated to test your individual
power of individual thought, and with so much chance
to make up your own minds for yourselves, as this of
the, at present much despised and neglected, Shake-
speare question.

getting its breath back, It will not be long before it will
think it saved itself. Then, will the people, too, go back
on Franklin Roosevelt? Probably. People have been
known to do that in the past.

N OUR COMPARATIVELY long list of presidents, none

has had the social consciousness of Franklin Roose-
velt. . None has felt the hunger of the poor, the destitute
hopelessness of the sick and unemployed, the yearning.
crying need of a destitute people. President Roosevelt has
been a. humanitarian. The greatest who has ever sat in
the White House.

Big business argues that the President’s measures im-
pede the recovery of business and are social, not recov-
ery, legislation. Vi-’e are glad of that. We are glad that
Mr. Roosevelt supports social legislation. It is far more
important than all other kinds of legislation put together.
We do not care to have all the nation's mills and fac-
tories humming with work, turning out proﬁts for their
owners, while four or ﬁve million still starve, still sleep
naked, and still are ravaged by illness and penury.

Shelton Prepares Summer
Language Course Schedule

Dr. ’\V. H. Shelton, head of the mod-
ern languages department, has pre-
pared a statement of the courses for
the summer session of 1934. In each
of the three sessions conducted on the
campus, July 18-29, July 2-August 10,
and August 13-24, modern language
courses will be offered.

Because of the impossibility of an-
ticipating demand, the work in the
pre-two weeks and post-two weeks ses-
sions this year will be on the “indi-
vidual work” basis only. Registra-
tions will be accepted for any course
regularly offered by the department,
and the time of the instructor will be
divided among different groups, in re-
lation to the number of registrations
for each.

The Campus Scout

i‘ '1 ‘.
Double Duty is '
An interesting fact came to light last week when the boxers of the Snee
Athletic Club of Brentwood, Carrick, and other points on the compass, and
the Pitt boxers were practicing for their bouts at the South Hills Country
Club last Saturday night. In the afternoons, the Pitt
boxers, numbering among them Captainelect Giannatti,
Spiegel, Kopp, Konick, and several freshmen, walked up
to Trees Gym and worked out under Captain Jack
Schricker. After the Pitt boys had ﬁnished their work-
outs, around six o'clock, Schricker left for home. To-
wards eight o’clock_, the Panther boxing captain took a
short walk to the club rooms of the Snee Athletic Club
where the Snee boxers were Waiting for their coaching.
This is possibly the only time on record where both
teams in a boxing match were coached by the same fel-
low. The tact that the Pitt boys were willing to make
the long trek to Trees Gym every day testifies to
Scllricker's popularity, and the fact that both groups of
boxers were willing to have him coach them is good
pr-:)ol' of his ability.

An Open Letter To Dr. 0’Loughlin

My Dear Doctor:

I consider the University of Pittsburgh extremely fortunate in obtaining a
man of your ability to coach its tennis team. It is my honest opinion that
you possess the necessary ability and general knowledge of the game to give
Pitt a winning team. However, if I am not too inquisitive, I would like to
ask a question or two.

You know as well as I do that tennis is a very popular sport everywhere,
and the large turnout at the first meeting on Friday afternoon at the stadium
proves that Pitt is no exception to the general rule. I have noticed, by look-
ing at the schedule, that you play your ﬁrst match this coming Saturday at
Grove City, weather permitting.

I may be a bit old fashioned in my views, but I can’t see how a team
could be possibly picked to represent Pitt in the short space of tiine that has
been set aside for the purpose, since the first workout of theseason has been
called for this afternoon. There is the matter of the twenty-ﬁve or more can-
didates for the team that must be considered. Looking over the list of appli-
cants for the team, I ﬁnd that only Captain Nate Ganger and a gentleman
named Slocum possess the necessary experience, and have proved their worth
to claim a post in the varsity lineup. The remainder of the squad may have
played before, but we have no way of knowing just how good or bad they are
until we see them against EVERY other candidate.

Considering that Ganger and Slocum are available, I was won-
dering just how the other four men were going to be picked for the
Grove _City match in the short space of time between Tuesday and
Friday. Naturally, this is a hard task for anyone, and I am taking
the liberty of informing you of the procedure in past years.

It has been a quaint Pitt custom in the past to select the six men
for the first match on short notice, without eliminations, relying on
the future to provide the time necessary to weed out the undesirables
and select the six men who were actually the best. Now what hap-
pened? The matches were so close together, that the original six
couldn’t waste their time fooling around with eliminations. It finally
got so bad that there were many candidates who were never even al-
lowed on the court. It used to be common practice for a man on the
original six to actually refuse to play a man outside the charmed
circle for fear of being defeated and losing his coveted place on the
varsity. -

The fact that most of the days allotted for practice sessions were “rained
out” did not help matters any. But that was the past. Let's start this season
right and give every candidate for the team a chance to show what he has
BEFORE ANY TEAM IS PICKED. If this method is followed out, there can
be no dissatisfaction, and you will be starting out your coaching year with
the backing of EVERY candidate (whether successful or not).

The backing of candidates for the team means more than most
people think. To me it means that the players respect the coach,
and once that attitude is created, the greater part of his work has
been accomplished.

Now you may wonder just how to go about this elimination with-
in the short space of time before Saturday. I’d suggest that you ask
for a postponement of the Grove City match for a later date. That
will give you time to check on the abilities of ALL of the applicants.
However, I'm not the coach, and you are. You are running the team and

will do what you consider best. I know that you have had sufficient experi-
ence in the tennis game to know that teams are not picked on reputations of
fraternity affiliations. ABILITY is what counts, and no one can tell just how
much ability 3. person has until he sees him in action.

Maybe I’ve said too much, but I hope you take this in the manner intend-
ed, that of bringing to your attention the fact that tennis candidates in the
past have been dissatisﬁed with the methods of team selection, and are look-
ing to you to give them a square deal. Personally, I will follow developments
closely, and I am sure that you will change the old order to see that every
one is given ‘.1 trial before the team is picked.

Sincerely,

 

 

THE CAMPUS SCOUT.
