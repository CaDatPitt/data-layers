City Council passed a prelimi-
nary bill yesterday that would

ban natural gas drilling within S

city limits.
The Council voted 8-0 in favor
of the ban championed by council

member Doug Shields, who pro—'

posed it in early September. The
council will vote on the ﬁnal bill
next Tuesday.

“I am gratiﬁed by the unani-
mous support of my colleagues for
this critical piece of legislation,”
Shields said in a news release. “I
hope that other municipalities
across the Commonwealth will
follow our example.” Shields rep-
resents Districts, which includes
part of Squirrel Hill, Point Breeze

The bill proposes a ban on all
drilling within city limits. Accord-

Social and Urban Research, oil and
gas companies have leased 1,600
parcels of land in Allegheny County
over the past two years.

Pitt doctors combat military injuries

Doctors Amy Nau and Scott Lephart develop strategies to prevent and reduce soldiers’ injuries

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

More soldiers will get injured as the Unit-
ed States enters its second decade of war
in the Middle East, so medical doctors at

‘ Pitt are researching ways to reduce and '

treat military injuries.

“They deserve the best type of science
we can get them,” said Dr. Scott Lephart,
who outlined Pitt’s contributions to mili-
tary research last night as part of the Uni-
versity’s Alumni Lecture Series.

The University of Pittsburgh Alumni
Association and Alumni Relations for
the Pitt Schools of the Health Sciences
presented the series, called “Strength
Through Partnership: Our Military and
Beyond.”

Organizers said the series brings in
about six lectures a year. Last night’s lec-
ture was the kick-off for this year.

’ Red, white and blue tables adorned
the grand ballroom in Soldiers & Sailors
Memorial Hall — patriotic decor that
largely suited the lecture..Pat Carver,
executive director of Alumni Relations
for the Schools of Health Sciences, said
this was the first time the Alumni Lec-
ture series reached out to the “military

presented by Lephart, director at UPMC’s

Neuromuscular Research Laboratory. -
“You are probably thinking, ‘What in

soldiers have similar needs, and his team
created a training regimen that focused
on preventing noncombat-related injuries
like sprained ankles and knees.

Brigadier General Roy Uptegraff III S

Guerra attended the lecture. Guerra said
the research is “really thinking outside

Uptegraff, who said he has been to

Wickenden said this would be a change from

previous years, when the Board ran an ad in The

The decision‘ to not place ads will save SGB

The event is called “Movember,”
and it’s a global campaign to promote
awareness about illnesses commonly

1900s adapts legend of missing woman

Liz Keeney
Staff Writer

The 1900s
Brillobox

Today at 9:30 p.m.
Tickets: $8 ‘
412-621-4900

Once upon a time, there was a British
woman named Licorice who left her
family in search of an adventure and
disappeared from the public radar.
Now, about 20 years later, her story
has become the concept for indie-
pop band the 1900s’ latest album,
Return of 1/36 Cerztugz.

The 1900s will perform at Bril-
lobox tonight in a show based upon
their recent album and the woman
who loosely inspired it — Christina
‘Licorice’ McKechnie.

McKechnie’s story grabbed the
attention of 1900s vocalist/guitar-
ist Edward Anderson while he was
traveling through the Southwest.

“It wasn’t ‘ripped from the head-
lines’ exactly, but there was this

woman, Licorice, from the Incred-
ible String Band. She left the UK for
Arizona . . . and disappeared. Itwas
the mystery I gravitated towards,”
Anderson said.

The overall message of the album
is something many people can re-
late to — the reconciliation between
your past and present selves, some-
thing vocalistjeanine O’Toole says
she thinks is a common struggle for
most young people.

“A lot of it is about running. It’s
a narrative about this woman leav-
ing everything and getting mixed
up in some crazy stuff but eventu-
ally returning home,” Anderson
explained.

Whereas Licorice never did
make it home, the safe return of
the album’s heroine is something
Anderson thinks is important to
its story. .

This record isn’t the ﬁrst con-
cept album the band’ has released.
Anderson said some of the things
that unite each of the 1900s’ releases
are the underlying themes, compli-
mented by the stylings of each band

ALBUM REVIEW .

Von Balthazar pulls
off one-man band

Sara Pecora
Stajf Writer

Troy Von Balthazar

How to Live on Nothing

Third Side Records

Rocks Like: Andrew Bird with a
dash of Animal Collective

Grade: B

The idea of adding yet another one-
man band to the world can cause
most people to cringe, but Troy Von
Balthazar actually manages to make
it work.

Through looping and program-
ming, Balthazar has created the per-
fect feel to go along with his quiet,
lilting vocals.

Most of Balthazar’s songs have
a faraway quality, an ethereal tone
that makes you feel like you ﬂoat
when you’re listening to them. That’s
not to say, however, that he doesn’t
mix it up; tracks like “Happiness and
Joy” and “Mt. Balthazar” have more
of a standard indie-rock feel, while
“Wings” has afolky tinge to it.
Almost all of the songs, however,
seem to have a sadness underlying
them; they feel bruised, defeated,
like they’re the hipster equivalent to
the Charlie Brown sad walking mu-
sic. The only track I would say does
not ﬁt into this mold is “Santiago,”
which has more of a vicious quality
to it. Unlike its album compatriots,
“Santiago” holds its head up high and
punches anyone in its way with slam-

“Every album we do has some kind of
theme, but it’s really just there for us. But if
you catch it, that’s cool,” Anderson said. “Cer—
tain things tie it together that are the same.
Our singers have recognizable voices. On this
album, we were experimenting with things,
doing more what the song dictates. We weren’t
worried so much about certain styles. We don’t
want to get pigeonholed.” . . '

One of the difficulties the band might
encounter would bethe number of people
involved in recording — at any given time,
the 1900s consists of upward of six members
—- but both Anderson O’Toole insist that
this is not the case.  A

“We start with one person or instrument

V and build on that. There are very few times-

when all of us were there in the studio. It’s
pretty mellow,” O’Toole said of the recording
process. 

. "Anderson said, “A lot of the times, I’ll come

. up with an idea, and I’ll‘ record it on my phone

orcomputer. And then we either all come to-
gether to work on it, or one or two people
at a time. Each person’s personality is well-
represented-.” ' ~ ‘ V
, Initially inspired by everything from the
soundtracks of .’5os ‘Italian ﬁlms to Buddy

* Holly to the ﬂowery rock and pop of the late

’6os and ’70s to Serge Gainsbourg in the ’80s,

the 1900s have ﬁnally moved into the new mil— 7

lennium with Return of the Ceniugi. With this
album, the group ‘has added a more modern V

feel to its sound, which Anderson dubbed as
“psychedelic pop.” ‘
“We were more overtly complex, very ﬂow-
ery and Baroque. It was a deﬁnite 1960s sound.
What we’ve learned is to strip down to the es-
sential elements. It is what it is, nothing more.
Not better or worse, just us,” Anderson said.

‘ With the new album, the band tightened up
on its songwriting, creating a more “carefully
arranged” brand of pop, which led to a more
stylistically simple, yet reﬂective, album.’

“It’s really cohesive. Each song makes sense
with the rest. Even though they’re different
styles, they all belong there. It’s also more
concise; none of the songs are too long. Pop
songs sound kind of silly when they do tha ,”
O’Toole said. ’ 

O’Toole said that the bandtook its time 1

recording Retum of I/yet Century, making sure
that everything worked together to achieve
that cohesion. , A 7

“It took us a long time, almost a year. We
would record different people in different

- places. Maybe it didn’t need to take as long,

but you want to take a step back sometimes,
let it sit,” she said; ' B

And since the band has undergone some
recent changes in the lineup, O’Toole thinks
that this has ultimately changed the direction
the band is taking for the ﬁiture. “’

“We’re minus two original‘ members, and
that changed a lot. We’re writing differently,
performing different roles. We all have a dif-
ferent outlook.” If

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers to face second test of season

Team to tip off against I llinois—Chicago tonight in second game of

Brody Engelhard
Staff Writer

The men’s basketball team will
face the University of Illinois— Chi-
cago in a match-up tonight that
should provide less of a challenge
than the Panthers’ shaky season
opener against the Rhode Island
Rams earlier this week.

0:, The Panthers, No. 5 in the na-
tion with a 133-11 record, will tip
off against the Flames in the Pe-
tersen Events Center at 7 p.m. The

Talib Zanna:

35.7 minutes per game.

UIC brings back two of its top
three scorers in Kreps and fellow
guard Zavion Neely. The junior
Neely is listed at 6—foot—1 and
averaged just over 12 points per
game last year. Neely completes
the dynamic backcourt for the
Flames, the most experienced
part of the team.

Besides the addition of seven
newcomers to the Flames, UIC
also brought in a new head coach
to a program that went 8-22 over-
all last year with a 3-15 confer-

We just need to keep playing better

in

Flames have never won a game in
the NCAA tournament, going 0-3.
They last appeared in the tourna-
ment in 2004, losing 78-53 to No.
4—seed Kansas.

“We just need to keep playing
better and be ready to play on
Wednesday,” Pitt forward Talib
Zanna said about the prospects
of a Pitt victory.

The Flames are led by point
guard Robo Kreps. Kreps aver-
aged just over 15 points and two
assists per game last year. The
senior is the clear go—to guy for
the Flames and led the Horizon
League in minutes last year with

ence record. Head coach Howard
Moore takes over for the retired
Jimmy Collins.

Moore comes from a Univer-
sity of Wisconsin team where he
spent six years as an assistant

— coach and helped the team to a

23-8 record last year. He was with
the team when it won both the Big
Ten regular-season and tourna-
ment championships in 2007.
Moore, a Chicago native and
graduate of the University of Wis-
consin, was charged this offsea-
son with the task of leading the
Flames and trying to challenge
Butler for the league title.

IIHROWINQ A KIRSCH BALL

What to look forward to in Big East basketball

 
  

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Watching the men’s basketball
season opener against Rhode
Island this week, I couldn’t help
git think that the intensity of the
game matched something you’d

normally see in March, not No-
vember.

In its own odd way, this strange
moment served as a reminder that
there is a whole Big East season yet
to be played, a season that should
be full of intrigue.

With teams made of fresh faces
and some with new coaches, there

' But Moore ﬁrst had to intro-
duce himself to his new players.
The Daily Herald reported when
Moore was ﬁrst introduced as
coach that Kreps said: “I looked
him up on Google, actually. I—re—
ally didn’t know anything about
him. I liked what I read, obvi-
ously.” L -

Moore will also work to pre-
pare UIC for an opponent it shares
with Pitt — Rhode Island. The
Flames and the Rams will square
off on Nov. 21.

~ Beating‘ Rhode Island was a
tough opening assignment for the
Panthers.

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said in a news conference after
Monday’s game, “Obviously we
have great respect for Rhode Is-

land. The reason why teams don’t.

want to play them, especially on
Nov. 8, is becauseof how we_ll
they play and how well they’re
coached. We got the game we
thought we would tonight.”

With one game under the_ir
belts, the Panthers are off to their
usual start and hope to continue
their record of 76-1 versus non-
conference teams at the Pete.‘

Senior Brad Wanamaker stood
out in the game against the Rams,
scoring 24 points while dishing
out eight assists and going 10-13
at the charity stripe. A

“It’s good to have an intense
game early on,” he said. “It’s not
something that we’re used to, but
I think it’s going to help us in the
long run.” I ' i

are more than a few things that I’m
waiting to see unfold.

At the top of my list is how the A

new coaches at Rutgers, Seton
Hall, St. John’s and DePau1 will
work.

tant and Robert Morris head coach

Mike Rosario and Greg Echenique
transferring out of the program,
that seems about right.

many places to go but up, so it’l1be

their roster, which includes Jeremy Hazell
and Herb Pope.

One Big East coach picked, St. John’s to
ﬁnish ﬁrst in the conference. Although I
wouldn’t go that far, I really liked the hire
of Steve Lavin for the Red Storm. And with
a roster loaded with veteran talent, includ-
ingistandout D.J. Kennedy, it’s certainly
plausible that with the right coaching, the
team will make some noise in the Big East
this season.

Oh, poor DePaul. The Blue Demons have
only one win in the Big East over the past
two years. With Rutgers, there was hardly
anywhere to go but up. With DePaul, there
is literally nowhere to go but up.

Former Clemson head basketball coach
Oliver Purnell took the job shortly after the
national championship game last season.
He guided Clemson to the NCAA Tourna-
ment last season, compiling a 21-10 record.
Nobody ‘is expecting an NCAA tournament
berth for DePaul, or »a postseason at all,
for that matter. It’s all about baby steps
for the Blue Demons. Two Big East wins,
perhaps?

Here’s another thing I’m waiting to see
in the Big East, and it’s something that will
make Pitt fans smile: Scottie Reynolds no

longer at Villanova. Does that mean those ‘

2009 NCAA highlights will stop replaying
every ﬁve seconds? Maybe. Hopefully. .
But it also means that the Wildcats will

have to win games without their leader. '

Some experts seem to think it will be addi-
tion by subtraction, but we’ll see.

The Coreys —- Stokes and Fisher — are I

the most eligible to step up and ﬁll Reynolds’
shoes. They’ve spent most of their careers
in the background-with Reynolds taking the

spotlight and the maj orityof the big shots. -
' But Reynolds won’t be there this season,

and much like the Pitt players last season,

somebody is going to have to step up.
There will be some of the same in Syra-

cuse, where Scoop Jardine and Kris Joseph

will attempt to fill the vacancies left by’

Onuaku. I’m still not sold on the Orange as
one of the Big East’s top teams, but I could
be ifjardine andjoseph step up to perform
like many people seem to expect.

As a side’ note, I’m also anxious to see
how the Oakland Zoo greets Jardine after he
accused Pitt of playing dirty and the referees
of letting the Panthers get away with it.

Georgetown also faces its fair share of
changes in the absence of Greg Monroe.
Chris Wright and Austin Freeman are still
in Hoya uniforms. No, you aren’t alone: It
does seem like they’ve been there for 17
years and counting. The Hoya offense will
be a lot more guard—oriented this season,
and Wright and Freeman make up one of the
most talented backcourts in the country.

Speaking of talented backcourt play-
ers, the Connecticut Huskies return All-
Big East guard Kemba Walker. _But will that
be enough to pull the Huskies from their

1 dismal 18-16 season and back into the Big ,

East Championship and NCAA Tournament
discussions? We’ll see. 1
Connecticut faced an offseason full of
NCAA violation accusations and replays
of the season that, landed it in the NIT in

Storrs, Conn.

It almost seems natural that the Huskies
will rise to the top of the Big East, but I don’t

- think they will this season. So I don’t know

what I’m more eager to see — whether the
Huskies put together an NCAA Tournament-
caliber season or if their fans have a level-
four meltdown if they don’t. _

And ﬁnally, there are the Pitt Panthers.

.What do I want to see?

I can’t wait to see whether they live up to

‘their billing, win a Big East regular-season .
or tournament championship, and eventu-

ally end up in the Final Four. It seems like
the Panthers deﬁnitely have the talent and
athleticism to do so. But despite how the
game against Rhode Island. seemed, it is
stil1‘November.
We’ve got a long season left to go. ﬂ
