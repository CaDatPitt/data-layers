See You at Intermission . . .

by Wayne Claeren‘

_ . “The Visit,” because of its unique plot and excellent
.'cas'-t, has been an eagerly awaited motion picture. How-
ever it does not live up to its advance notices. The story
is novel enough but it is a bit too contrived and coinci-
‘deuce-ridden to capture the intellect completly.

 _:, Ingrid Bergman, after a few years absence from the
-.s-creen, returns in a role (which will please her devoted
fans but which does not equal some of her past perform-
ances.

Anthony Quinn, an actor’s actor as well as a popular
_—rugged hero type, is excellent. He and Miss Bergman,
"especially when wor-king together, give the film its best
_moments. ‘Certain individual scenes also shine with deli-
cate emotional changes and psychologi'cal complications.
" “The Visit” is based on a play by Swiss Playwright

. Friedrich Durrenmatt. The English translation was per-

formed on the American stage in 1958 with Lynn Fon-

tanne and Alfred Lunt playing the roles now done in the

ﬁlm by Miss Bergman and Quinn. _ ’
 The story tells of ruthless Woman who, in her
Wiyouth, was betrayed by her lover and by the people of
.Guellen, her home. town. After 20 years she returns
«escorted by an army of servants, a Rolls Royce, and a_
* pet cheetah- Time has turned her misfortune to millions

* of dollars. ‘ .

Guellen, now poverty stricken, gives Madame Za.chan-

,l__,a'ssian (Miss Bergman) a great welcome in the hope that

rector of men's housing.

she will use her fabulous wealth to bring prosperity back
to her old home town. She agrees to do so and, in addi-
tion, promises a huge amount of money to be given out-

right to the citizens. “Wonderful,” the people shout——

but there is one catch.
Ex-Lover Must Die

The catch is that Serge Miller (Quinn), who is the
town store keeper, must die. He had been Madame’s un-
faithful lover years ago when she was simply Karla, a
town waif. Now Serge must die if the town is to be
saved.

Everyone cries “Ridiculous” and the Mayor says
Guellen will starve before it lets a favorite son die for
such a reason. But Karla, conﬁdent and passionately
bent on revenge, brings a huge taste of material bless-
ings to the people and slowly each one turns on poor
Serge. The fair minded town doctor, the dedicated
teacher, and Serge’s own wife are no exceptions.

As the conclusion draws near, the them<+—that money
can_buy anything, even human decency——is driven home
again and again. Man’s greed is an old target and this
slash at it is a bit too elaborately contrived.

The facts that Karla is not merely rich but “the
richest woman in the world,”' that the town is completely
bankrupt, that Karla is so open and brazen with her offer,
and that the people so unanimously acceptjst after being‘
tempted, make‘ the story unique in the extreme. ‘”

Editrial: Double-Edged Resiionsibility
' Barry Goldwater has made no public statement about the bad press he's getting

V for his campaign, but several of his aides have made private statements about mis-
representation, unfair treatment, even TV and/ newspaper “smear.”

In an article in last week’s Press, Scripps-Howard Staff Writer Jack Steele
ilaid open some of the treatment the Goldwater camp has given newsmen, treatment
that might well in fact stimulate such a bad press.

Inthe month since he has opened his campaign, for instance, the GOP nomi-

nee has spent four to ﬁve hours many days riding in the same jet with about 50
‘newsmen. Not oncehas he ventured to sit down with them and talk.

He has also cancelled the only two press conferences listed on his schedule and
the only “background” session.
, _. From an interview on this “technique” in his campaign, Steele cites Goldwater’s
V comment on a “one-party press”: “The own er or publisher of a newspaper has the right
 to do anything he wants on the editorial page. Of course, it doesn’t make me happy
to see some of these Republican papers endorsing Johnson, but that is the owner’s
. privilege.”
‘ “He added, newspapers have a
news objectively.”

This is certainly a beautiful truism and one that journalists mumble to them-

selves in their sleep. But news'is a two-way deal—it has to be given out as well

 , as written. A newsman can cover a ﬁre and describe what he sees from outside the

house, but the meaning behind the story—-whether a cow kicked over a lantern or a

little boy hated his father -—- comes from a co-operative s o u r c e. And if a reporter
doesn’t see this side his objectivity is automatically limited.

Goldwater has nothing to complain about, because in this area of his campaign

Wi'th the closing date of the 1964-65
New Yord World’s Fair less than 13 days
away, many may wonder whether it was
really worth the two dollars general ad-
mission fee, the long wait to get into the
free exhibits, the exorbitant food prices,
the confusion, and noise of the masses of
people who visited the Fair each day.

Anyone who missed the Fair this
season and is contemplating a visit when
it re-opens in April, should take heed of
the experiences and reactions of several
University students who were front seat.
spectators at the Fair when they worked
there this summr.

Three seniors, Anne Kozart, Jeannie
Kornfeld and Eta Stein shared an apart-
ment in Flushing and worked at the Fair
for part of the summer.

Concerning her job, Miss Kozart re-
calls, “The whole thing was a mess!” The
Brass Rail Restaurant Company employed
thousands of college students and prem-
ised them two meals a day along with

Monday, October 5, 1964 — THE PITT NEWS — Page ‘5.

Miss Kornfeld also worked at one
of the Brass Rail stands, then quit to take
another job at one of the expensive French

restaurants, the Chez Germaine. Miss
Kornfeld, chuckling, related her experi-
ence: “I’d never done any waitress work
before and to top that, everyone in the
restaurant spoke French but me! Between
the busboy and the bartender, I managed
to get the orders straight, but what was
really funny was when a group of young
kids would come in and try out their high
school French I”

Paul Farber and Barry Shaw’, also
seniors, have many unusual stories of their
own to tell about the Fair. Said Farber,
“I worked at the Texas Pavilion, and the
strangest thing that I remember about the
Fair was the people!”

Farber was also impressed by the typ-
ical comments of the tourists: “Forty
cents for a hot dog! How’s a guy sup-
posed to bring his family to da Fair?”
and ‘N o roller-coasters? What kinda Fair

The tragedy with too many tourists,-
the students all observed, was they didn’t
plan their trip. Consequently wasted their
time and money wandering around—-—get-

headache and corns and callouses on their
feet.

consisted of one hot dog and “one sham-

“I thought the Fair was too commer-

things worth seeing were the big indus-
trial exhibits such as General Electric,
General Motors and Ford.”

Art Exhibits, Fine Books Enhance University Center

(This is the first of a two part series on the
University Book Store.)

Are you building a pagoda? Interested in practicing
ancient Hindu medicine? Or are you just beginning your
collection of primitive Eskimo art?

If so you are probably a regular visitor of the fine
books and arts section of the University Book Center.

Most students, however, aren’t so lucky, for few
have heard about this outstanding collection of ﬁne books
and works of art.

Rare and Unusual Books

The Fine Books Room is devoted to the rare and un-
usual in books and art. Besides books on every aspect of
art, art technique, architecture, and photography, there
is a large collection of‘ out-of-print and rare‘ books. Even
art books in foreign languages are included among the
7,000 volumes, according to manager Richard Bergmann.

“We have one of the best selectionsof foreign
books in the East, other than New York,” claims Berg-
mann’s assistant, Marianne McWillia.ms.

Recently, for example, a man from Moon Township,
looking for pictures to use in building an authentic pa-
goda, ended his search at the Fine Books Room, where he
found two.

Relaxed Pace

The pace in the Fine Books Room is relaxed and the
atmosphere is informal. A student can roam among the
books and works of art, or sink into a comfortable leather
chair and read anything from a leather bound classic to
Pig Sticking in Bengal. He can look over these books,
yet not feel obliged to buy them.

Rotating art exhibits, a newly added feature of the
Fine Books Room, display original graphic art, which
highlights the work of artists not yet well-known in
the Pittsburgh area. Currently on exhibit are the wood-
cuts of Mrs. Helen Siege], 3 Philadelphia artist who
has illustrated two children’s books.

The Fine Books Room has also held some of the first
United States exhibits of foreign artists, such as Anton
Mehringer’s water-color display. Woodcuts by Ta-ssos,
designer of Greece’s stamps ince 1956, were shown for
the second time in the country at the Bookstore. Every-
thing shown is for sale.

Exhibits Student Work
“And we are willing to accept student art exhibits
if demand and quality warrants,” stated Bergmann. Some
student work has been exhibited in the past.

Other original works on sale include Indian and
Japanese prints, French lithographs, and Eskimo
painting and sculpture.

Surprisingly, almost all these items are within a

student’s budget—some original woodcuts are under five
dollars.
Less Expensive
Even less expensive are the quality reproductions,
which include picture postcards, sculptures, gold framed
reproductions of Italian masterpieces, and works of Amer-
ican and European artists.
Every Friday afternoon from 3 to 4 p.m., the Fine
Books Room sponsors a free coﬂ"ee hour for all students.
During this informal hour students are encouraged to
look over or discuss any of the books or works of art
that appeal to them, according to Bergmann.
“We’d like to nurture something here which the stu-
dent can carry on after he is out of college.”

BRIAN GENERALOVICH (left) stops William and Mary quarterback Dennis Haglan for
a short loss in Saturday’s football game. Fred Mazurek (right) demonstrates some of

_ By BOB SMIZIK
 The experts listed the Panthers’ Saturday game with William and Mary as a
breather. The dictionary lists breather as “a period of relaxation after exertion.”
‘The experts and the dictionary were 3both -right as the Panthers never breathed hard
and allowed their fans and coaches to breathe easy while they whipped an inex-
perienced and underweight W & M team, 34-7.
Fred Mazurek and sophomore halfback Bob Dyer were the only Panthers who
worked up much of a sweat as they dominated all ﬁve Panther touchdown drives.
Dyer, who had the unenviable task of playing behind Eric Crabtree and Bill
Bodle for the season’s ﬁrst two games, got his ﬁrst taste of varsity action Saturday
when Bodle was hurt. 3
Pace Five Attacks
He and Mazurek paced all ﬁve touchdown drives. Mazurek passed and ran 63
yards on the Panthers ﬁrst touchdown effort of 87 yards. Dyer ran for 45 yards
on the second scoring drive which lasted 6'7 y.ards.

Maziirek’s 38 yards on the ground were 20 short of the maximum on the
third drive. Mazurek picked up 28 of the 30 yards on the fourth drive before Dyer
let quarterback Kenny Lucas get into the act on the ﬁnal score. It was a 73 yard
scorin-g series with Dyer running for 31 yards and Lucas passing and running for 30.

For the day Mazurek picked up 87 y.ards on the ground and 141 in the air
while Dyer ran for 66 yards.
The feats were somewhat diminished, however, by the lacklustre competition.
A Much Better Team

William and Mary coach Marv Levy stated the case splendidly when he said, A,
“We just ran into a much better team.” Levy illustrated his point by saying, “We knew

they’d try to run our tackles to take advantage of their power. But there was little
we could do about it. Our two second unit guards,gwho are responsible for stopping
off tackle plays, are ﬁve-foot-six and ﬁve-foot-seven inches.
Levy could also have i_nentioned._.his,._154-pound second unit endand. the.
165-pound center who runs with that team. “But he _didn’t have to. It was evident
to the 23,264‘ persons in a}>tt'eiidance.'“'t   ‘Z " ii‘. 

0- the maneuverability that netted him 228 yards in total offense on Saturday by elud-

ing an unidentiﬁed Indian taokler. W & ‘M guard Jim Dick (No. 61) looks on.

The Panthers pushed the Indians, who have only four seniors on the team, all
around the ﬁeld-to come up with another spectacular offensive day. The big difference
between Saturday’s performance and earlier showing against UCLA and Oregon was
that the Panthers put the ball over the goal line-

, _ Booming Backs

Mazurek averagedialmost 11 yards a carry. Dyer picked up more than seven
yards-each time he ran, while Crabtree, Jim Dodaro, Jim Flanigan, and Dewey Chester
all averaged around six yards a carry. Mazurek completed ten of 16 passes. The Pan-
thers total offense came out to 495 yards for an average Of almost Six and One-half
yards for each offensive play. _ .

Levy was generous in his praise of the outstanding offensiveplay by 
“Mazurek is an outstanding quarterback,” he said. “He apparently carries a little
more of the attack this year than he did last year.” (Levy coached California in a
losing effort against the Panthers in 1963.) c

He hesitated, however, in comparing Mazurek to Navy's Roger Stau .
Navy beat William and Mary last week. “Staubach played very little against us,”
Levy said, “so I don’t want to make a comparison.”

Levy did make a comparison between the teams that Mazurek and Staubach run.
He said, “Pitt is a different team than Navy. They .are much more powerful. While
Pitt's backs may be as fast as Navy’s, the Navy line is much quicker. I couldn’t select
a winner between the two teams because we didn’t get enough chance to see Staubach
in action.” ' _

Other than Mazurek, Levy had no idea who was doing the damage against his
team. “We were so concerned with stopping What Was going. We didn’t k1'l0W W110 W35
doing it. But it looked like all their halfbacks played good games.”

Over irithe Panther dressing room it was a far diﬁerent scene than in the two
previous games. Well-wishers were moving from player to player offering congratula-
tions and John Michelosen smiled for the ﬁrst time this season.

Next week the Panthers will go against West Virginia. Some may consider that
game a breather,tbut it can’t be. A breather is a periodof relaxation after exertion
and the Panthers did anything but exert themselves against William and Mary.

burgh the talk is about the Owl.

Owl coach Paul “Hippy” Borman
said of _the annual Birdbath af-
fair. “The only time we lost was
when we forfeited.”

V Rich “Long Bomb” Stamper
paced the Owl attack by scoring
two touchdowns. He caught a
30-yard pass from Borman, and
a 40-yard pass from Earl “String-
bean” Fischl.

The Owl team took an early
6-0 lead, but lost it when George
“Mustachio” Lies completed a 10-
yard scoring aerial to Bob .“Sage”
Smizik. Lies completed a pass to

Ron “Golden Boy” Shearer for

the extra point.  

 

“We didn’t do so well in the
ﬁrst half, but once we started to
move the ball and pass more, we
dominated the rest of the game,”
said coach Leo Bemis. Ohio Uni-
versity only had ﬁve shots the
entire game, ,while the booters
took 37 shots.

“If we’d have been a little
sharper with out shooting, we
could have run up a big score.
A number of our shots, however,
were right to their goalie. They
Weren’t a bad team, in fact, they
handled the ball well and play-
ed tough. They just didn’t have
the shooters, and we did,” said
Bemis.

_Although Bemis felt there
were no outstanding players,
he said that the linemen played
a much better game than

against West Chester. “Our '

  
 

forwards were better than their
backs, and that’s why we were
able to stop their shooting
rives.”

“Art Richardson handled him?
self real well as he played his.

ﬁrst varsity game at fullback.
However, the key to our win was

that we played goodas a team “ A

and were able to get shots,-” said
Bemis.

Vince Bartalotta, Sam Donatelli,

and George Shimpino had one.‘

Millilio as our top candidates,” said coach Leo
Bemis prior to the season. Lang has started in
both the Frostburg and West Chester games and
had three gtals scored on him. A

“Both boys are about equal, and their main
weakness is that neither of them dive on the ball
readily. It’s not an easy skill to acquire, but it's
a necessity for being a. good goalie,” said Bemis.
Lang feels that his inexperience has not hurt

I his conﬁdence,-but admits that he still has diffi-

I culty in deciding whether to dive on or kick a
ball. ' '

“I try to dive first, because that’s the correct
way, but it’s still a decision which you’ve got to
make at the moment the ball is coming at you,”
said Lang. -

Lang said this had happened when the win-
ning goal was shot by West Chester. “We had a
three man wall (three man standing together in
front of the goal) and the ball spun around it.
There was a jam and I kicked the ball, but then
two West Chester men converged on it and scored
the goal.

Former Hotel Serves As Dorm
For 127 Johnstown Undergrads

This past summer the Universi'ty acquired the Fort Stanwix Hotel for use by

the J ohnstown Center.

The acquisition came basically as a gift f-rom the principal owners of the hotel,
George H. Love, and his sisters-1n-law, Mrs. Dorothy R. Love of J ohnstown and Mrs.
Helen L. Herzog of New York City. Mr. Lo_ve IS a former J ohnstorwner and a member
of the University of Pittsburgh Board of Trustees.

The University received approx-
imately two-thirds holdings in
the hotel from the Love family,
and bought the other one-third
intrest at $100,000. '

There are 127 students being
housed at the Stanwix this fall
under the faculty supervision of
Robert Kennedy and Mrs. Rob-
wrt Kennedy, manager of the
bookstore and speech teacher, re-
spectively, at the college; Roy
J ohns, Administrative Assistant
at the college; and Miss Weamer,
mathematics teacher at Cochran
Junior High School. These fac-
ulty members are responsible for
the control of all students activ-
ities in the dormitories and are
accountable for the furnishings
and faciltiies used by the stu-
dents.

The dormitory students have
organized a governing board
consisting of ﬁve men and ﬁve
women students, and presided
over by a general] chairman.
The members have also elect-»
ed a men’s judicial chairman
and a women’s judicial chair-
man who deal with abuses and
infractions of dormitory regu-
lations.

Bus transportation is provided
to and from the college, and
meals are served at the Oak Din-
ing Room to the students resid-
ing at the Stanwix. A lounge is
furnished for student use on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor. Approximately one-
half the students are occupying
double rooms and the others are
in single rooms, with male stu-
dents occupying the ﬁrst, second

and third ﬂoors and female stu-
dents on the fourth ﬂoor.
For Dormitory Purposes

Although the Fort Stanwix will
continue to operate as it has been,
the University at Johnstown in
using whatever space necessary
for dormitory purposes. Officials
have noted that the college will
probably use the hotel until the
summer of 1967, the anticipated
date of completion of the build-

ings and dorms at the new cam-
pus site in Richland Township.

Commenting on the Fort Stan-
wix acquisition, Dr. Theodore
Biddle, president of the college,
said, “The Fort Stanwix will be
of great assistance in solving
our present housing problems and
should enable the college to en-
roll more students from out of
town and thus become a more suc-
cessful and cosmopolitan school.”

Johnstown
Placement

Tests Higher

Dr. Paul Walter, Dean of J ohns-
town College, announced that
the results of the placement tests
the incoming freshmen class
completed on September 2 show-
ed a substantial increase over
placement in recent years.

Of those who took the lan-
guage placement examinations,
nearly 20 per cent placed beyond
the ﬁrst level in French; 27.5 per
cent placed beyond the ﬁrst level
in Spanish; and 28.5 per cent
placed well in the German tests.

Said Dean Walter, “I am cer-
tainly well pleased with the ap-
parent quality of the incoming
freshmen.” He went on to say
that the results of the tests in-
dicate good preparation in high
school.
