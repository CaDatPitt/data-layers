Pitt’s coming tuition increase,
University 'student governments
have mailed out letters to the
Pennsylvania Senate and House
Appropriations Committees, ask-
ing for a stand on commitments to
higher education in the state.

The letter is sponsored by' the
University Student ‘ Board, com-
prised of the Undergraduate
Student Government (SG), the
School of General Studies Cabinet
(SGS) and the Graduate and
Professional Student Association
(GPSA).

“A particular concern of ours is a

the letter stated. .

Higher Education, ‘the current

national average for tuition in-
crease is 12%, and because of the
probable 15% increase at Pitt, the
various student governments felt
some definition of the tuition
situation is required, according to
.SG President Larry Platt.

for more state money. .

“Even if we don’t receive
any more money,” he added, “the
letter asks for ’a guide to the

crisis.” 4 .

SGS President Beverly Cohn said
the letter was an idea stemming
from Governor Shapp’s recom-
mendation that state tuitions rise
no more than 10% and that the
University Student Board was
requesting a similar stand from the
legislature.

“We have to go along with the
tuition increase,” Cohn said, “but
it must be a fair increase. The

  Weekend

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Pitt’s Student Health Center will
be closed on weekends soon
because of department budget
cutbacks, according‘ to Student
Health Service Director Dr. JoAnne
Robinson. '

' The elimination of the weekend

._ service could come as early as July

1, Robinson said. No comparable
treatment has been offered. yet by
either the University or local

, hospitals.

The service cut is part of a
University-wide move toward re-
ducing operational costs in ‘all
departments.

“It’s a legitimate budget cut,”
Robinson said. “It was nice to be
able to .offer special weekend
treatment to students, but if
something had to go in the

program, this had to be it.”

The Health Center, located in the
Schenley Quadrangle, presently is
open to student patients on
weekends, regardless of their

"maladies--head colds as well as

broken legs are treated. Severe
emergency cases ‘are referred to
Presbyterian Hospital.

“The Center ,will operate now
more like a family physician,”
Robinson said. “Students will
have to wait until Monday morning

before they can see a/doctor. They

can get treatment for real
emergencies at one of the Oakland
hospitals. ’ ’ .

The local hospitals, though, will
not be able to offer students
reduced ‘rates for treatment as the
Student Health Center does. »

Vice-Chancellor of Student Af-
fairs Alfred Moye said the Student
Health’ Service had to face major

~. cutbacks “the same as everyone

else.-'

“In an era of short money, as we
are in,” Moye said,’ T ‘we’ve just got
to do without the niceties.”

According to -‘Moye, each depart-
mentin the University must ﬁnd .a
way to meet theineeds it serves
under the handicap of monetary
cutbacks.  ,

“The weekend service has been
nice,” Moye .said, “but -it isn’t
necessary.’ ’ ' .

Robinson also ' reported that
cutbacks in other areas of the
Student Health program will have
to be considered if the department
is to meet its budgetary target for
1976. ‘

“I’m in the process of deciding

what parts of the program must be '

reduced,-” she said. “I’ve got to
report to Dr. Moye soon on what I
can do. In any case, we’ve got to
meet his suggested percentage of
budget cutback. -

Both Robinson and Moye refused
to give an exact percentage of a
budget ‘cutback the Student Health
Service is expected to take.

The cost for treatment at the
Health Center is notfexpected to

’ “We.’ve held back the cost of
treatment here against inflation for
three years,” Robinson said. “I
don’t see -how it’s going to be
possible for us to keep from raising
the price students pay this year.”

Robinson cited higher doctor and
nurse fees, equipment and medi-
cine costs, as reasons for the
impending cost increase.

-In addition, Robinson said there
is a forseeable increase in the price

students will have’ to pay for

treatment at the Center because of

CAS   Council Approves 

Linguistics Major Plan

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

A proposal to create an under-
graduate major in linguistics was
approved by the CAS Council at a
closed-door session of Wednes-
day’s meeting.

The move followed an open-door-
session in which linguistics depart-
ment representatives related de-
tails of the proposal. . I

The undergraduate program, as
outlined by the linguistics depart-
ment, would incorporate graduate-
level courses, which would then be
cross-listed under both curricula.
This would avert a budgetary strain
by opening classeslto both groups
of -students.

Under the present system,
undergraduates desiring to take .
linguistics courses, most of which
are restricted to the graduatelevel,

must ‘obtain perrnission from _the;"- v;

Mayaguez Crew,-

BY HOWARD BENEDICT ‘
Associated Press Writer;

WASHINGTON . AP--President : 
Ford said early Thursday: the-‘
captured American merchant ship"
Mayaguez had been recovered and G, ,
its entire 39-man crew safely
recovered. . " V 

The ‘President spoke somberly, q
and after his very brief remarks " .
walked slowly from the press '

the White House, a few steps from ~_
his Oval Ofﬁce. ‘ , C

Speaking for no more than‘ a.-,.\
minute, Ford said: ‘‘I have now: 1‘
received information that the
vessel has been recovered intact
and the entire crew has been ,
rescued.” . l _ -_ _' ’_

Ford, speaking about ﬁve hour,s'_\':
after he’ ordered Marines to boardﬂ‘ H, ,
the ship and invade an island at:,‘;'

The mission has been “success-‘_

He ended‘ his statement_ by
saying; ‘.‘.I wish to express my deep ’

exits, which can be opened from
the inside. “Students see people
standing outside these doores and
they think, ‘Ah! I’ll let them in,’
without even knowing who they
are.” She said consideration is
being given to the idea of having
regular security guards patrol the
doors.

These are the kind of problems
that are in the way of the working
out of a security plan for the ‘fall
and winter terms. “We draw up

plansand then see there are too‘ 4,

many ways to get-around them,”
Woodson said. “We need a
thorough but “quick procedure,”
shesaid.

The increase in trafﬁc and
activity during the fall and winter
months, especially during the day,
makes the present 24-hour security
plan for those terms unfeasible.

In Woodson’s eyes, the problems
of the security.system stem from

‘students trying to get around the

procedures. “The only way the
security system is going to work,”
she said, “is if the students do not
sign in people they do not know.
They have « to understand . the
importance of what could happen.”
Woodson wishes that students
would realize-how open to attack
they might be from outsiders,
especially since as she put it,
“We’re in the heart of Oakland..
People want to come here because
there are so many things avail-
able--stereos, TVs, etc.” '

She also pointed out that. a
student‘ caught vandalizing or
creating a disturbance in the dorms
will be sent to the Campus Judicial
Board. If the person- is a

non-student, the resident“ who \
signed him in will be sent before-

the Board. She said this will be
another good reason for residents
to know the people they sign in.
Woodson, sees a need for
improvement in students’ ‘ attitudes
towards the security system:

“The odds of trouble are

around,” she said. “Students
don’t work for security. You ‘can’t
wait for things to happen to you to
take an interest in the security
system. There is a need to increase
the 'level of awareness about this.”

Others see the problems differ-
ently. The students interviewed by
the Pitt News said they were
concerned about _ having good
seﬁirity, but they saw ﬂaws in the

i system. ‘

“Some of the security guards
check IDs, but others don’t,” one
student said. “We’re paying for it
so it might as well work right.”

. Another student voiced the same .

complaint, saying, “The security
system is not protecting, anyone.
It’s totally ineffective as it now
sstands.” He pointed out that

as he sees it, is that the University

“The football players give us the

Forgie said there is always a

Linguistics program

(Continued from Page 1)

Two major reasons stated for
starting the undergraduate pro-
gram were student interest in
linguistics as a major, and

I increased availability of linguistics

courses to students majoring in
«elated ﬁelds, such as psychology,
Eﬁiiesophy and speech’.

. .“Linguistics is an aspect of
learning that permeates human
life,” Paulston emphasized. “As
such, it is.good preparation for jobs
in other ‘fields (non-academic),
such as law.”

Studentexposure to a number of
foreign languages, rather than the
mastery of a few, through a
linguistics background, is the

preferred aim of the proposal.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said .

that of seven CAS Council
members who attended the meet-
ing, six voted in favor of the
proposal and one abstained. The
next step in considering the
proposal will be to send it to the
Provost for ﬁnal approval.

The decision of the CAS Council
will be published

Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in Harris-'

supported schools, also has been
forwarded a copy‘of the letter, as

tors, local and national press and
Penn State and Temple ‘Univer-
sities. , ‘

“We ‘would hope that student

Temple make similar requests to

“The students are held. in limbo as
everybody rhetorically pronounces
their commitment to high-educa-
tion without saying‘ what the
commitment- is...” -

In another tuition-centered
move, the members of the

» Despite occasional student protests concerning the hassles of
cooperating with security personnel,
behind the idea of no security, system at all. As long as student rights
are not sacrificed by overzealous enforcement, dorm residents have
“protectiontogainandnothingtolose fromasecurity system. The
' nuisance of presenting a Pitt ID to secmity personnel upon entering the
Towers is a simll price to pay for round-the-clock coverage against
' The drawbacks in Towers security, however, do not stem from
, student unwillingness to cooperate, but in the inability of some guards
-"in keeping watch on their doors. Some security personnel have blamed
__- the system’s ineffectiveness on students who run past the desk without
‘ showing their IDs. But assuming that some of those who slip past the
 desk are outsiders, the University would be naive to expect them to
,9 stop of their own accord and be turned away.
The guards who are too preoccupied to check identiﬁcation are
'1 leaving Towers residents open to the most serious of crimes. Sitting in
the same spot for-several hours may appear to be an undemanding job.
But despite its seeming ease, the responsibility of each guard cannot
be underestimated. Though the Pitt dorms are not known for a terrible
' crime rate, the chief concern of residents and guards should be the
-potential for ‘danger that exists in every security situation.
 Regret over the loss of one’s possessions is usually the first
 consideration one thinks of in regard to dorm security; though loss of
I lifeiior bodily harm is a rare occurrence, the Oakland streets and
‘hi  neighborhoods abound with such crimes and it would take very little for

police ofﬁcer should man the desk along with the security guard to

serve as a deterrent to would-be encroachers.

This set-up would do away with the all-important time element that
allows outsiders to reach the elevators and head up to a room before
the campus police can even be phoned. An oﬂicer at eiich door
certainly would discourage any evil elements from trying to slide
through; his presence also would improve the efﬁciency of the desk

 Pain and Loathing

V BY DOUG GEBHARD

that excruciating torture when a

Idea for Dorm Security Struggles

1 ‘An insuflicient security system in a campus dormitory is potentially

dangerous to the well-being of students who live there. The conditions
that Pitt must contend with as an urban school make the Towers even
harder to safeguard, thus calling for an ever-competent campus police

For the past 30 years the plight
of the Palestinian people has gone
by unnoticed by the American
press. At most, the information
has been grossly distorted, at-
tempting to portray the Palestinian
people as barbaric terrorists.
Therefore, every year on May 15
since 1948, the Palestinian people

. relive the tragedy of their expulsion

from Palestine. That expulsion
which came at the hands of the
Zionists was culminated in the
establishment "of a racist, colonial-
settler state, i.e., Israel. The
Zionists attempted to erase Pales-
tinian identity, Palestinian national
character and Palestinian indepen-
dence. Since the Palestinians were
exiled to Jordan, Lebanon, etc., the
Zionists chose to conclude that
there were no such people as
Palestinians. Israel, in conjunction
with Arab reactionaries and Ameri-
can imperialists, is to this day
attempting to obliterate the re-
emergence of the Palestinian
‘identity and national character and
attempting to destroy any pro-
gressivism in the area.

However, the Zionist’s plans to
erase the Palestinian from the face
of history were disappointed in
1965 with the establishment of the
PLO. The PLO emerged as the
culmination of their struggle to
reassert an independent role in
their self-determination; a new era
emerged. In addition, the
neighboring Arab peoples have
historically been threatened by
continuing Zionist expansionism.
Therefore, the unity of struggle
between the Arab and Palestinian
people has been strengthened by
the threat of their common enemy.

of the Palestinians

However, many enemies (imper-
ialism, Israel, Jordan) fought
against this resistance movement
(PLO) in order to keep the
“Palestine question" out of the‘
struggle so that the Zionist,
imperialist, reactionary Arab re-
gimes could maintain the legiti-
macy of the state of Israel. A mere
sampling of the genocide perpet-
rated on the Palestinians includes:
the 1970 and 1971 massacres by the
Jordanian regime in which 25,000
Palestinians were killed; the
continuous bombing of the refugee‘

_camps in Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon by the Israeli Air Force,
and the actions‘ of the reactionary
elements in Lebanon in 1969, 1973
and 1975.

After the 1973 war, the PLO_
leadership advanced a very realis-
tic and decisive 10 point transi-
tional program, the essence of
which is the establishment of a
national Palestinian authority. on
the liberated Palestinian land from
which Israel niightbe forced to
withdraw. This advanced program
has mobilizedall the Palestinian
people around _its objectives and
has culminated in the realization by
many countries that the PLO is the
sole representative of the Palestin-
ian people. This 10 point program
has enabled the PLO\to win a series
of international victories, the last of
which was the invitation to the UN
by 105 governments. At this
meeting, the General Assembly’
adopted a resolution recognizing
the national rights of the Palestin-
ian people. The resolution
included the right to return to their

The‘ United States spent $28

regimes, military regimes and
countries ( dominated by personal

Of 42 African countries, 38 fell
into one or another ‘of these
categories and received $5.4
billion. ’ Eleven countries in the
Western Hemisphere are under

- military or personal rule; they were

givenmore than $7 billion.‘ Two

Czechoslovakia, $189 million;

Soviet Union, $1 billion; Yugo-

Assistance to other dictatorships

  Decorator’s Show House Quite a

‘BY KATHRYN KIMBALL
This weekend, instead of lo_oking
at the cracked plaster of your
apartment or the drab furniture in
your dorm, why not roam through a

Victorian mansion that has _been_

transformed according to 34
different tastes?
The Hillman house [of the same

-9,,-/‘ mily that helped to fund Hillman

library] on,5045 Fifth Avenue has

been divided into 39 areas and

assigned to interior decorators by

the Junior League of Pittsburgh.
The result is overwhelming.

Each room seems to belong in a

- separate house, yet at the end it all

fits together. Open“ books,
half-ﬁnished knitting and music
help create the illusion that the
occupants have just stepped out--a
really grand display realistic to

. eyes unaccustomed to such splen-

dor. . . _ . ‘
_ Persian-Pasha’s Passion Parlor is
one of the most spectacular

house. Nude paintings adorn the
walls. Floors are made of mirrors
and the varnished fabric matches
the drapes.. Sinks and walls are
hand stenciled and painted. Lamps
are made from real ostrich eggs
and Chinese candlesticks. There
are roped handrailings, antiques
and a bubbling enclosed fountain.

Comments heard from spectators
ranged from “It’s just gorgeous!”

- to “How awful!" In short, nothing”

about the Decorators’ Show House

is dull.

“One hundred decorators were
sent invitations to design a room,”
Decorating Chairman Diane Taylor
explained. “In February, 50 ﬁrms
looked at the house, got ideas, and
listed three rooms they liked. Then
we tried to coordinate the
designers with the rooms,‘-— and
ﬁnally ended up wi}h 34 decora-
tors.”

The interior decorators were
notified about their rooms at the
beginning of March, but were not
allowed to begin work until April 1.
The show opened April 26.

' “It was surprising that such a
large number of people were able
to accomplish_all-that we did in
such a short time,” said .Warren
Kimball of Fox Chapel Interiors.

“There were designers, painters,
paperhangers, .carpenters, elec-

, tricians, and their equipment all in

a small room at the same time. _

“The first job for a designer is to

Kimball explained. “For instance,

“The idea is to have people walk

piling up debts. A ﬁnal-game
ticket sale helped pull the club out
of its red-tape nosedive, and the
IOUs were wiped out--as were the
club's opponents.

The hockey team labored over a
budget last month for the ’75-76
season. As is the case with all
budgets, the ﬁgures had to seem
realistic to both the team and the
Student Government Allocations

‘ Committee. .,They did, and the

Committee agreed to‘ match the7
team’s dollars, to a $6,644 ceiling.
According to the budget,_ already
streamlined and frugal, the club
will have to come up with nearly
$12,000 on its own to meet the
working total of $18,000. ,

Seem like big bucks for a college
organization? Whether small-time
or pro, hockey teams have _to pay
for iceprental (game and practice),
transportation, insurance and
game expenses.
team members, however, buy their
own equipment, which represents a
significant item on most « other
teams’ budgets.

Twelve’ thousand ..dollars sound
like a lot to the Pitt Hockey Club,
too.. So, during the summer, when
hockey players should be golﬁng,
the club is trying to raisefunds.
Co-President Bob Arturo has hung
up his skates and rolled up his
sleeves. “We’re trying "to get
money from alumni, but most of
the money is going to have to come
from other sources,” he said. We
depend on the students.

“We got everything we asked for
from allocations,” Arturo said,
“but we can only hope it’ll be
enough.” -

- So Pittsburghers with “ice in

' their veins” don’t have to wait until

IF.

- BY HARRY HABBEL

Playing its toughest opponents of
the season, the varsity men's .
tennis team dropped two consecu-
tive matches this past weekend. _

Friday, the Cat netters traveled
to University Park to. battle a
powerful Penn State squad. The
Nittany, Lions proved a formidable
opponent as they swept Pitt 9-0.

Eastern champion Jan’ Bortner
downed the Panthers’ Joe Kantor
in convincing fashion‘, 6-2, 6-0 in
the top singles match. Bortner.’s
devastating forehand produced
many winners, wearing down
Kantor the way he has worn out

nihers lose to  East Powers 

most of his opponents this season.
The number two and three
matches saw Tom Current and
George Dieffenbach of Pitt playing
perhaps their best matches of the
year. But the two were still unable
to produce a win. Current lost to
Peruvian national champion. Mi-
guel Maurtua, 6-1, 6-4, while
Dieffenbach was beaten 6-4, 6-1 by
Edgewood’s Jack Cobetto. '

At number four, Mike Habbel‘
dropped his first match of the 1975
season, 6-4, 6-4 to the Nittany
Lio‘n’s Jim Howell. The closest

‘ match of the day produced

numerous long rallies and over-all
fine tennis by both players.
, Another Western Pennsylvania

product,_ Mark Darby of Beaver,
defeated Harry Habbel at number

.ﬁve, 6-0, 6-2, a score duplicated at

the sixth position, in which the
Cats’ Gary Mosso lost to State’s
Sam Schwartz. 0 i
' In all the matches, the Panthers
simply wereoutcl-assed by a PSU
squad that annually defeats many
of the East’s top teams.

The disappointing weekend con-
tinued on Saturday, when Pitt lost
to Bucknell, again by a score of 9-0,
at the Bucknell campus in

P Lewisburg.

- ‘Although not of Penn State’s
caliber, the Bisons displayed a
strong lineup'from one to six.
Standbuts included Casey Jones, a
top-ranked netter in New England, a

and John McManigal, seeded
number two on the Bucknell team.

The best match was again in the
number-four spot, in which the
most consistent performer for the
Cat netters all year, Mike Habbel,
lost to Bucknell’s Allan Jay, 3-6,
6-3, 6-4. A strong server and

volleyer, Jay kept Habbel at 

baseline throughout, forcing him to
hit accurate passing shots for most
of his points. In the end, it was this
steadiness by the Bison player that
made the differences.

The losses. dropped the Pan-
thers’ season record to 7-4.

  Jamaica A Springboard.-9  

’ BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor _

They’re calling it the dream mile 

to beat all dream miles. The best
milers in the track world, amateur -
and professional, are getting
together this Saturday night during .
the International Freedom Games
at Kingston, Jamaica‘;

There’s no doubt most of the top
names in the sport will be on hand
for this prestigious event.

Filbert Bayi of Kenya ,will be
ﬂown in just for the event to keep
his string" of ﬁve consecutive mile
wins_intact. Bayi is also the world
record holder in the 1,500.

Eamonn Coghlan,“ a name
familiar to anyone. who attended
Pitt’s Invitational last weekend,
also will be at Jamaica. Coming off
a 3:56.2 mile that took the laurels
here last week, Coghlan is capable

of running a 3:53, according to his .

coach at Villanova, “Jumbo” Jim
Elliott.

Rick Wohlhuter, not your aver-
age 26-year-old insurance sales-
man, will be competing to’ prove he
is the best American _ miler, a

- distinction given him by receiving

the 1974 _ Sullivan Award last
month. Wohlhuter has not lost to
an American inthe mile. for over a
year. -

Perhaps the biggest name at the P

0 Dream Mile is one from out of the
past, a person, who was the best
himself just a short time ago but

after police said they found the pair
asleep in the nude in a van parked
on a downtown street. Miss.Sabol
was also charged with possession
of marijuana. ,
In St. Petersburg, State Atty.
James T.‘Russell said he did not
feel there was enough evidence to
prosecute either Jones, 32, or Miss
Sabol. _ ‘
Jones was placed ‘on the. disabled:
list and left in Florida at the end of 

spring‘ training. _ He‘-"underw‘_enp’t

dropped from the ﬁeld--and made a
lot of bucks doing it. '

V The man’s_ name is Marty
Liquori. 'The'last timehe ran with ‘
‘any sort of publicity was in 1971
against anotherrfarnous‘ name, Jim
Ryun, is yet another dream mile,
which Liquori won by ﬁve feet in
3:54.6. .

Since ’71, Liquori has’dropped
out of rimning almost entirely,
except for tuneup races now and
then, to pursue a more lucrative
career. Come on, let’s face it,'he’s
'making a lot of money. You
probably don’t even‘ know it when
you see his bright, shiningiface.

Shining Mart is ABC’s ‘track
man._ Anytimethere is a major
track race covered by the TV
network, Liquori is on hand in.his
tan-colored suit with the black’ABC
patch on the chest. He walks)
around interviewing_the big names
of the race and commenting on how
this event or that event is
progressing. It's really hard work,
but through it all there is ole Marty
smiling bravely into the camera.

Look at it this way, why bust your ,
backside racing every week when
you can " make all that money"
talking about something you’ve

done all your life? When you do ’

something that will still let you run
whenever you want?‘

Liquori indeed has it made. And
he is only 25 years old, with"
perhaps his best years as a_ runner‘
still ahead of him.

Don’t get me wrong. I I think
Liquori is still one of the top milers
in the world. But to me it isn’t fair
for him,to pick when and where he
wants to, run while everyone else,

(Pro and amateur, is running as
often as he can for little money or
for his school. ’

"Liquori says he is in the best ,

shape he has been in for a longtime.

His former coach at Villanova
Elliott agrees withjhis. Mentally,
he is ready for the stiff competition
in Jamaica, and he has run a 3:558

. indoors--just warming up._

‘With all‘; that money, from TV, a
Liquori certainly looks in shape. ;-_.

;..,While Tied ering the_t._ ”nd.oor. s 

  

‘comes along.

/.

..-

championships in Detroit last
March, I ‘had the honor of seeing
the man in the ﬂesh, and he looked
as if he has just stepped off’ the
track at the 1968 Olympics. He
looked in shape and talked with the
air of a man who knows he has it
made and is enjoying ‘whatever

.Liquori has stated he’s been
waiting for this meet for a long time
and his wife admits he is a little
tense. ’

Perhaps the meet in Jamaica is

____ 

nothing more than a tuneup for .

something :even bigger than. a

dream mile. The world is planning
a little 1 celebration called the
Olympics next year in Montreal.

[Perhaps Marty is really using the

Freedom,Games as a springboarﬂ

to Canada. -

' And why not? Although he is a
professional sports announcer for
ABC, he wisely has not turned Pro
and so has retained his amateur

V
‘.7-L '
.; ' -1
\ -‘V

status in the track world. He also I

has not attracted too much
attention since 1971 and has been
able to run and train in veritable
seclusion. Montreal has to be the
big goal in Liquori’s head. He’ll be
26 next year, and it could be his
'swan song as an amateur. He has
to want it very badly.

‘ -Jamaica is the hurdle, ‘to be
jumped now and Liquori is ﬁred’ up,.

particularly by Wohlhuter’s" com- -2"

ment that he is the best miler in the
United States. Liquori said the
statement was erroneousiand will
use the Freedom Games to ram it
down Wohlhuter’s throat.

Both men agree the time for the
mile will be under 3:55 and say
Bayi probably will start at the front.

Wohlhuter and North Carolina’s

 Tony Waldrop may ‘be late kickers,

putting on a ﬁnal burst of speed in -

the ﬁnal quarter.

is Where will Liquori be? vHe is a
sustained kicker, meaning that he
can begin his burst with a half mileﬁ\‘a..
to go instead of with a quarter--the "’
tactics he used against Ryun in ’7l
to finish him.

It wasga lot like the last time he
had seen the Airplane with Marty,
but the inescapable emptiness left
behind by Jorma and Jack could in
no way befilled.

There were no light shows...37
projectors...25 slide projectors...10

Marty Balin, founder of the

His voice was known as the ass
kicker’s voice of the group, but
everyone loved Grace more for her

out all right, but Marty had_ most of

When he left Hot Tuna,
rumblings surfaced and instru-
mental breaks became more of a
regular feature and dependent part
With Jack dancing
behind his shades and Jorma
slicing out his wah-wah with
cutthroat licks the Airplane took a
new direction--more tunes featur-
ing Jorma on vocals.

Then it happened...David Frei-
berg joined up...singing. From
Quicksilver bassist to vocalist.
Then Hot Tuna left, forcing the
Airplane to land and regroup.
Using the Starship concept since
Blows Against the Empire 1p and a
cast of thousands to be depended
upon (Crosby, Nash and Garcia
among them), the Jefferson Air-
plane, like the Sixties, faded out
and the Jefferson Starship emer-
ged as the new vanguard for latent
dope rock.

The last tour was. a smash and
Dragonfly a hit. They were hot and
Balin wanted in. He was recording
with Starship on their latest lp (Red
Octupus) and was ready to
tour...again.

Paul had the camera and enough
ﬁlm to shoot about a hundred
pictures and Ihad the mini-pad and
Bic ﬁne point. On stage they felt
the burst of energy and worked at
getting into the setting.

“Ride the Tiger” scorched the
audience and the new “Fast Buck
Freddy” quickly set the mood for
the post-Watergate madness ses-
sions. Balin’s “Witcher” from
Bodacious was a trance...his street
corner talkin’, shakin’ and be-
witching glares had resurfaced.

“Papa John didn’t do much for
me,” he said. “A lot of hype and
filler for the lack of good guitar.”
Paul was lost in his lens and the

F-stop was nervously twitching.
Marty came over to the keyboards
and guzzled down a Michelob and
stung me with
comeback song.

“Incredible_,” he said. “I never
thought he could get his old style
together.” And then Balin did
“You’re drivin’ me crazy...”
Pushing his hips out to the sound

dragonﬂies who snuck around the

Paul was crazy by now. He

camera? Negative impressions

him sitting at the piano.

“That-was good, David.”
