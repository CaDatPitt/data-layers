Commending the University's Learning Research and "Development Center, Dr.

Peter H. Odegard,‘ Falk Professor of political science emphasized the necessity _for an
open door policy in education, at Thursday’s Honors Convocation in Carnegie Music Hall.
Presented by Chancellor Litchﬁeld to a sparse audience, Dr. Odegard stressed that opening doors
in education means “an equality of educational opportunities from nursery school to graduate school
and beyond, not for-a select few but for every child physically able.” '
Dr. Odegard contrasted the present aims of education to the principles stressed in Colonial
America. Early textbooks presented “indoctrination in religion and morality” whereas’ today’s educa-

tional institutions must be “dedicated to equality and freedom.”

Freedom, Dr. Odegard continued, is the ability to make meaningful choices from daily alterna-
tives. “As an educated person is more likely to make choices, he is more likely to be free.

Furthermore, equality does not mean uniformity but an equal opportunity for all to realize
personal growth, the affirmation of individual differences, and the achievement of excellence and

distinction.

To obtain such equality, education must take into account physical and environmental difficul-
ties which may handicap an individual’s learning and ability. Poor performance on IQ tests may re-
ﬂect only these handicaps and merit, not an elitist doctrine towards the few who seem capable, but
education of a specialized and superior type for the many who need it, he asserted.

Institutions such as the Learning Center are aiding in research to ﬁnd the best ways “to edu-
cation from the periphery to the heart of civilization. As much hard-nosed research should be done on
education as on physics,” but those concerned with formal education as contrasted with learning
through newspapers, magazines, and television will have to practice “Spartan fortitude and Christian
forbearance,” Dr, Odegard added. _

Although education is the largest single item on the national budget outside of defense, he ob-
served, it is still only ﬁve per cent of the gross national product and could be doubled or tripled

without harm. In the “Great Society” education means “more civilized men who are less likely to
prefer violence in politics, more hopeful of the future and more at home in a pluralistic universe.”

Chancellor Litchﬁeld presided over the convocation, citing the gathering as the most important
of the three University assemblages during the year because it reﬂects “a common concern for scholar-

ship and scholar.”

Bill Amended to Open
Allegheny Obse rvatory
For Astronomy Course

By MARIE KUKICH

State Representative Edward L. Dardanell, Penn Hills
Democrat, has introduced an amendment to a House bill to
open the Allegheny Observatory for free classes for Alle-
gheny Countystudents of astronomy and space science.

Dardanell has obtained agreement of the bill’s sponsors
to attach his suggestion as an amendment to a bill which
would give the Observatory a $50,000 annual grant to oper-

ate the observatory. _

Dr. Nicholas E. Wagman, head
of the Allegheny Observatory,
said that the program would re-
ceive his support if activated. He
also considers the main bill “a
good thing.” Referring to the
closing of the Observatory plan-
ned by the University, Dr. Wag-
man said, “I never thought that
it would happen, and I never
thought that the people in Pitts-
burgh would let it happen.”

The closing of the Observatory,
one of a number of University
economy moves, -has been dis-
cussed before, Dr. Wagman re-
Vealed. “It was considered about
4%» years ago,” he said. “I sup-
pose that they thought then that
having two classes and three pro-
fessors made no sense. We are
here primarily for research, how-
ever."

State Gets

Criticized for

Giving Aid
Students and administrators at

Indiana State College have criti-
cized the state of Pennsylvania

' for giving aid to private institu-

tions, especially the University.

A group of state legislators, in-
vestigating the high cost of col-
lege, listened last Wednesday to
charges that the state helps pri-
vate schools to the detriment of
state colleges.

The complaints referred more
exactly to the University, said
Rep. Edward Dardanell, Demo-
crat from Penn I-Iiills.

“Of course, we expected this
complaint, but it runs deeper

than I had thought,” he said."

“The feeling is that the state

Saga Dismisses Manager;
Discrimination Charge Filed

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Saga Food Service has
fired one of its managers be-
cause of what Saga called
his “incompetence as a man-
agement representative and
his poor attitude,toward
both employees and stu-
dents.” _

-Charles Douglas, director of
Saga Food Service, said that Cul-
len McCoy was relieved of his
duties last week, following an
investigation which he said con-
ﬁrmed numerous complaints
.against McCoy. .

However-, McCoy has ﬁled a

complaint with .the Mayor’s Com-
mittee -on Human Relations,
charging that he was ﬁred be-
cause he is Negro.

David Washington, an attorney
and chief of the Compliance Di-
vision, said that the committee
has investigated the situation,
and after it receives a reply from
Saga’s Home Office, will turn the
evidence to the Case Conference
Board which will make the ﬁnal
decision.

Commenting on the investiga-
tion, Douglas said, “The fact that
McCoy was a Negro had nothing
to do with it.” Explaining the
reasons for McCoy’s dismissal,

Douglas added, “There have
been complaints to the Dean of
Men's office, Saga Food Service,

and the Auxiliary Enterprise Of- A

  
    

1

ﬁce. These complaints have been -

found valid. We have also wit-
nessed instances where McCoy
behaved in the alleged marmer.”

When telephoned at home, Mc- -

Coy said that his lawyer had ad-
vised him “not to say anything”
about the case until a decision
has been reached.

Louis Mason, executive direc-
tor of the Mayor’s Committee on
Human Relations, also refused to
comment on the ﬁndings of the
committee's investigation.

Touching slightly on his
scheduled topic, “Religion,

Francis Braceland, of the In-
stitute of Living in Hart-
jford, Connecticut, empha-
sized the changes and re-
1 sponsibilities in the clinical
world 0 f psychiatry at t h e

dent Union Supper Room.
Dr. Braceland pointed out that
religion and psychiatry have uni-
que roles in dealing with man's
gmental and emotional disorders
and that these roles can neither
combine nor replace one another.
As a clinician, Dr. Braceland
_‘said that he is concerned with
‘ the mundane, the disordered and
-those with emotions cast down;
"whereas his audience was in-
’ volved with the sacred and up-

ﬂux" in a psychiatrist’s eyes.

It is known today, he pointed
out, that anyone can become
mentally ill and that mental ill-
ness is a direct result of the in-
dividual’s background and his in-
ternal and external motivations.

Modern medicine no longer
seeks to completely cure the pa-
tient but “to ﬁx them up so that
they may go home to their job
and family.”

Returning to his topic, Dr.
Braceland commented that in a
society based on order, the men-
tally disturbed are disordered and
that science and religion oﬁer
diﬁerent though not necessarily
opposing solutions to the prob-
lem.

Although suicide and juvenile
delinquency are emotional prob-
lems, the disturbed individuals
may be given spiritual solace.
Closer cooperation between the
two areas can establish a “line
of defense against mental dis-
orders with the aid of a public
anxious and willing to help.”

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

‘One would read Life with
 Picasso (McGraw-Hill, 373
I pp.; $6.95) to find out what
the great modern artist is
like, and in that respect, he
would not be disappointed.

One can ﬁnd out what Pi-

 thors, Francoise Gilot and Carl-
ton Lake. But what Picasso is is
-’ an entirely different matter. '

To label Picasso as an enigma
;at the outset, as is done with
"so many other renowned ﬁgures
of great creative power and pro-
duction, would seem to be seek-
' ‘ ing shelter under the eaves of a

’ cliche, but the label ﬁts the cu-
bistic jug too well.

Through the ten years covered
in the book, we see Picasso as
the master painter and artisan
and as the carping, bigoted aes-
thete. We see him grappling toe
to toe with truth and the essence
of things and as the all time boob
'' of a human being.

We witness his enormous in-~
tellect and powers of rationality,
' which are as piercing as his ex-
:,ploding eyes, and then we are
"presented with his provincialism,
his neurotic childishness, his in-
sane politics.

- We see him as stolidly moral,
delightfully immoral, and puz-
, I zling amoral. In short, we get a
" a sweeping account of what he is
like,’ and although more ques-
tions _than answers are the re-
, suit. the questions are delightful.

The authors of the book are

selves. Francoise Gilot, an estab-
‘ lished French painter in her own
right, duly records the highlights
of her career as Pa.blo’s mistress,
8¢°1’¢¢8l‘7. canvas-stretcher and
‘model.

She does so with clarity, depth
and great wit; but, as she vir-
tually admits herself, she had her
own personality problems before
she ever met Picasso. The result
is that her narrative ﬂuctuates in
its editorial view almost as much
as the Sprightly Spaniard’s
moods.

Carlton Lake, the high1y-re-
_spected art critic is more con-
cernedwith the artist’s products
than with the artist, as perhaps
we all should be.

One can imagine that his inter-
est in What life with Picasso is

like would be solely for another -

possible route into the painters
work.

The writing of the book, at
least in the English, edition, is
Lake’s, and one feels a constant
tugging at the editorial rudder to
set course for the philosophy of
Picasso's art, .a maneuver which
occasionally pays off.

Much the same happened in
Lake's famous interview with Pi-
casso in the July, 1957, issue of
the Atlantic Monthly, where he
successfully passed through the
fan magazine-type ﬂuff and got
to some very essential nuggets of
Picasso's thinking.

For it is Picasso's art that re-
mains the star attraction in this
book. We begin by relishing each
revelation of the artist’s mad-
cappefy —- how he baits his art
dealers, rages at other painters,
cambols after women — but as

. soon lost in the wash of an enor-

mous emotional hangover.

But when Picasso discusses his
art—his creative set, his tech-

niques, his judgments on the r

past and his winning hopes for
the future-—the book becomes al-
most‘ inspirational:

“I paint the way some people
write their autobiography. The
paintings, ﬁnished or not, are the

pages of my journal, and as such,    -i

they are valid. The future will
choose the pages itprefers. It's
not up to me to make the choice.
I ‘have the impression time is
speeding on past me more and
more rapidly.

“I’m like a river that rolls on,
dragging with it the trees that
grow too close to its banks or
dead calves one might have

A thrown into \it or any kind of

microbes -that develop in it. . . .
I have less and less time, and
yet I have more and more to say,

and what I have to say is, in-

creasingly, something about what
goes on in the movement of -my
thought.”

PiC8Sso’s “autobiography” has
far more value‘ than Francoise
Gilot’s memoirs, but she does ac-

complish what she set out to do; '

describe life with Picasso. Carl-
ton Lake uncovers the real pearls
now and then as his knife slips
in to Drobe the hard shell of the
man, and his art.

Favorable Word

‘ O
For Eric Stern

Editor, The Pitt News:

As if there are favorable things
to be said for Eric Stern, this
I newspaper has printed in the
last two or three issues, letters

  
 
 
 
 
   
   
   
 
   
   
  
   
  
   
   
   
  
   
    
  
  
   
   
  
   
  
  

critical to the extent of wishing
him bad luck!
Yet all of these criticisms have
lacked supportable reasons and
have overﬂowed with shallow-
’ ness. They are all based on Eric's
“unconventional ideas” (what are
they?) and Eric’s beard which
certainly indicates that he is im-
mature and much too radical for
the job.
To say that he is “anti-barber”
as was done in the most recent
criticism published, is indeed, to
reﬂect the general» level of the
writer's thinking.
To those who criticize looks or
 ideas simply because they do not
-ﬁt the conforming standards of
conduct, learn a lesson that col-
lege provides — there is more
S than one way to think and more
A - than one way to dress; explore
the variety of the former and
grow out of your concern for
the latter.

Students Ask

For New Image
Editor, The Pitt News:
There has been a lot of cor-
respondence attacking the presi-
dent-elect of the Student Govern-
ment, Eric Stern. We feel a more
positive approach should be taken.
Mr. Stern, if you would only un-
derstand the qualities looked for,

nay mandatory, in a student
leader.

A student leader must be, first
and foremost, well groomed. The
_student body is not unforgiving;
if you would only wear more
trim clothes, cut that beard and
hair, and get contact lenses, they
would forgive you.

We understand the rash ac-
tions that youth (unmotivated by
h unrealistic ideals) undertakes.
. All you need do is make the cor-
rect policy statements and we
would forgive you for your paci-
. ﬂst stand. Try advocating defolia-
tion of the Viet Nam jungles with
low yield nuclear weapons, or
state that you feel that the most

T should be a proper retaliatory
c stature.

S An investigation into the higher cost of college afforded a group of
_ -Indiana State College student leaders an opportunity to complain about
state public funds for private colleges. The University of Pittsburgh re-
ceived the brunt of their criticism.
_ _ These students insisted that the “state should take care of its own
first” and if money is left over, it should be given to private institutions.
» A specific point of criticism was the University’s Towers, which they
described as “plush.” In addition, the student group asserted that the
-. General State Authority paid for them.
In a private conversation, State Representative Edward Dardanell,
a graduate of the University and a member of the legislative group, refuted
one argument immediately when he admitted that the Federal Government,
- and not the State, had ﬁnanced the dormitories. When asked what gave
rise to the idea of “plushness,” he referred to rugs in t-he vestibules and the
circular shape of the Towers.
‘ Why do these students resort to such petty arguments? Perhaps
this verbal complaint avoids a problem that lies much deeper. It could well

yond the speciﬁc problems, you
might ﬁnd a general problem,
and solve it.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Your front page report of Colo-
nel Wagstaif’s discussion on dis-
armament (Pitt News, Feb. 26)
is a ﬁne example of prejudicial
reporting. Contrary to the nega-
tive viewpoint of your article, the
Colonel, on several occasions,
said that properly inspected arms
control measures, including des-
truction of nuclear weapons, con-
tinue to be seriously discussed.

Your article implies that nu-
clear weapons have made our
country secure, which Colonel
Wagstaff would deny; our ability
to wreak horrible revenge hardly
represents security. It is precise-
ly in their search for security in
the face of nuclear weapons that
nations of the world have come
to consider disarmament at all.

Finally, to my knowledge, no
mention of Russian insincerity
was made by the speaker. I
would prefer to see the editorial- "'

of that article restricted to the

Health Service
Called Complete

Editor, The Pitt News

Although I sympathize with
Susan Aitel’s having to wait an
hour at the Student Health Serv-
ice ‘(I refer to her Letter to the
Editor of Feb. 5), I do not con-
sider that sufficient rationale to
call the Health Service a failure.

She said that her “problem
was certainly not a matter of
life-or-death”; had it been, the
nurse was available for tempor-

-ary care. Furthermore, had she

sought help outside the Univer-
sity, I am sure she would have
found more than four "others in
the waiting room before her.
Pitt has one of the most com-
plete student health services on
the collegiate level in all areas.

Cheerleaders
Told to Lead

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was frankly quite shocked to
read the letter of Richard Kap-
lan, captain of the cheerleaders,
listing the excuses for the inept-
ness and lackadaisical attitude of
the cheerleaders at the Pitt bas-
ketball games. But one statement
was worse than all the rest.

The captain exclaims that the
cheerleaders are supposed to lead
the students and if “they will not
follow, our function cannot be
fulﬁlled.” Now surely Mr. Kap-
lan should realize that this is a
reciprocal relationship and con-
sequently, if the cheerleaders do
not lead, the students cannot ful-
ﬁll their function. of following.
But these cheerleaders don't want

to lead, they just want to direct‘.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

If there are a thousand or
more students at a football game
they are quite capable of direct-
ing the crowds’ enthusiasm. But
if only a few students show up
at a basketball game, these “lead-
ers” do not have the ability to
produce and lead a few enthusi-
astic cheers for the team. They
just give up and mope along the
sidelines, praying, no doubt, for
the quick approach of the next
football season.

I believe the solution is that
the cheerleaders must come to
realize that the world is not
obligated to love them just be-
cause they wear Pitt’s colors and
have the title of cheerleader, and
that just by standing up and fac-
ing the students with pained ex-
pressions they .are not going to
produce overwhelming excitement
and enthusiasm. They must be
prepared to do a little more than
warm the ﬂoor at basketball
games as See-no-evil, Hear-no-
evil, and Speak-no-evil.

read that “Dean Rush will con-
tinue in her duties of dean of
students and dean of women.”

Is it to brash to ask when Dean
Rush will assume the duties of
dean of men? It would be charit-
able to say that it is a great bur-
den to place on one woman the
responsibility of three positions,
but it would be more truthful to
say that it is a frightful situation
when the power of these three
offices are gathered in the grasp
of one person.

Will the new vice chancellor
now exert over every phase of
University student life the pa-
ternalism (maternalism?) as is
exercised over women and resi-
dent students. Will the new posi-
tion be one in which the dean’s
concepts of pseudo-morality pre-
vail in every phase of the stu-
dent’s life? .

With this new position, the
dean will be able to exert her
viewpoint without the chance of
objection from other .administra-
tive personnel—so it would seem
from past events.

It should be made clear that

this is not intended as a criti-
cism of Dean Rush’s administra-
tive capabilities, but more an ob-
jection to placing her in a posi-
tion in which she can exert with-
out effective ‘opposition views
which I, and I believe others, feel
are degrading to young adults
when these views are put into
practice by administrative edict.

private schools such as; Pitt only
if there is money left over.”

Dardanell said the Tower dor-
mitories were speciﬁcally criti-
cized on the assertion that the
General State Authority ‘(GSAl
paid for them, and that they
were * “plush.”

(Ed. note: The federal govern-
ment and not the General State
Authority, financed the Tower
dormitories.)

“We questioned a number of
student leaders who said that
even if there were a state uni-
versity in Pittsburgh with the
same tuition and facilities as In-
diana, they would still prefer to
go to school at Indiana — on
grounds that they wanted to go
to school away from home,” he
said.

Dardanell and the other legis-
lators expect to visit three or
four other state colleges around
the state to arrive at a solution
for the education of the most
students at the least cost.

Dardanell said that certain
deans and administrators at In-
diana felt “cheated" because of
the amount of money given to
the University.

He explained that “the college,
now trying to become a state uni-
versity, has an enrollment of
more than 9,000 students, yet re-
ceives only $2.5 million from the
state. This year the University
announced it was $415 million
in the read.

Said Dardanell: “They (the
state colleges) don’t feel the Uni-
versity should strive to‘ become
an Ivy League school on state
money."

Indiana State College, which
has a proposal before the Legis-
lature to become a state Uni-
versity,’ now has tuition fees of
$250 to $350 a year, with room
and board charges that would
raise the cost for a year to about
$1,100. This compares with the
$1,400 tuition and $900 room and
board rate here.

Ital. Awardee
Extends Stay

Francis Caporali, the re-
cipient of the Nationality
Rooms Council Italian Schol-
arship in 1964, has decided

to remain in Italy after com-
pleting his summer studies there.

In a letter from Pavia, Italy,
to Mrs. Frances Nesta, scholar-
ship chairman of the Italian
Room Committee, Caporali wrote
that he had gone through great
personal development in Italy,
and had found the best univer-
sity system for a classical edu-
cation.

Caporali is believed to be the
ﬁrst awardee not to return to the
United States after completing
his studies in Europe.

The Italian Room Committee
sends one’ student to Europe each
year to study for the summer.
Other nationality rooms also send
students abroad on scholarships.

ROTH McNALLEY
Has to Improve at Guard Spot

McNalley, LaVa1ley
Must Sharpen Skills

By FRANK SMIZIK

Next year two important men for the Panther basket-
ball team a-re Jim LaVal1ey and Roth McNalley. LaVal1ey
has to become a scorer and McNally has to ﬁll a backcourt
position. Both will be juniors and will have to improve over
their performances this year.

LaValley can jump but he hasn’t had the experience to
use his ability. At 6-foot 6 he is the tall man on the hoop-

sters squad and must carry the rebounding load.

~

“This summer I intend to work on my jumping and my offensive
moves,” said LaVal1ey. LaVa11ey’s six point a game average empha-
sizes his offensive deﬁciences. His lack of scoring potential caused
the Panthers to work plays so they didn’t give him the ball much.

At the beginning of the season Timmons was weary of using La-
Valley, but quickly realized that he needed more height in the lines-
up. The experience he gained this year should beneﬁt him for next
year and if he improves as much as he did between his freshmen
and sophomore season the Panthers will have a. center of Paul
Kreiger’s stature.

At the guard spot, McNalley will be the candidate with the most
experience. “I know I can shoot,” said McNalley, “but I have to learn
how to dribble a little better.”

McNally started ﬁve games at the beginning of the season but
Timmons realized McNalley’s fault in the Wichita game at the Pal-

estra. The Panthers had no one to bring the ball up court in that

game against the Shockers press.

“I haven't played guard until this year. In high
school I was the second tallest man on the squad
at 6 foot 1 and I played the corner position. On
the freshman team last I also played the corner
and Stan Falenski played guard. It’s a new posi-
tion for me, but I’ll play a lot more ball this
summer than I did last year.”

McNalley intends to stay more around: school
this summer and not work. “Tim Grgurich says
that I should play ball at Allderdice with him. A
lot of good ball players go over there and play
on the outside courts in the summer.” Many of
the Duquesne and other top players in‘ the city
come for pick up games every night to Allderdice.

Both players feel the Panthers won’t improve
on one of their weaknesses .and that is a poor
bench. “We need another big man to help out on
the boards,” said McNalley. LaValley echoed his Gets Rebmmd
sentiments and added that there will be plenty of guards next year
but no big men as replacements for the center and forward positions.

Pete Smith from Uniontown will be the main competition for
McNalley at the guard position next to Larry Szykowny. Smith was
here on football scholarship, but has decided to give up football and
play basketball.

If the Panthers do improve next year it will have to be because
the men on this year's team improved. The only freshman that Tim-
mons is counting on heavily is forward Ken Bollens. He provided
the scoring punch for the Cubs this year. Frank Fumularo and Bill
Bennett are other freshmen who will see some action for the hoops-
ters next year and will have to be the bench strength that the Pan-
thers need so badly.

ITI-IACA, N. Y.—-Syracuse was
at full strength for the ﬁrst time
this season as they upset Lehigh
for the Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Championships here
Saturday. The Orangemen placed
six of nine men while outpoint-
ing Lehigh, 65-59.

The (Orangemen rarely had
their best team during the dual-
meet season, and had a losing
record. Terry Haise (123) and
Jim Murrin (130) were hamper-
ed by injuries ..most of the year,
and football players Jim Nance
(heavyweight) and Gerry Ever-
ling (191) did not join the team
till their fourth meet.

Nance and Everling both won
titles, while Haise and Murrin
placed third. Lew Roberts was
runner-up to Penn State’s Marty
Strayer for the. 167-pound title,
while Tom Schlendorf was sec-
ond in the 177-pound division.

Dino Boni was the Panther’s
only champion, as he defeated
Army’s Mark Scureman, 6-4, for
the 147 -pound title. Although
Boni is usually quiet, soft-spoken
person, he was aggressive on the

Syracuse is at rown  

mat. He sprang to action imme-
diately, getting a take down at
1:20 and riding Scureman for
most of the ﬁrst two periods.
Scureman countered with a
take down in the third period,
but Boni quickly combated with
an escape and take down. “He
was tiring towards the end,” said
Boni, “and I was able to score
and ride him out.” ‘
“I guess the coach was right,”
said Boni, referring to a state-
ment by coach Rex Peery. “Boni
should be Eastern champ,” said
Peery earlierin the season. Boni
placed third as a 147-pounder
last year and was seeded second
with a 6-2-1 record. Scureman
had a 9-1 record, and was seeded
ﬁrst. .
Reigning 130-pound champ
Mike Johnson lost his title.
Army’s Bob Steenlage simply out-
conditioned Johnson with a 5-4
victory for the 130-pound title.
Neither wrestler had a lead un-
til Johnson escaped Steenlage
-and scored a take down at 5:20.
But Johnson was breathing heavi-
ly as the third period began,
while Steenlage was in superb
condition. Steenlage immediate-

defeated Mark Scureman of Army in the ﬁnals,
winning the 147-pound Eastern title.

ly escaped and then scored two
take downs on the battle-weary
Johnson.

Johnson was both offensively
and defensively ineffective

‘ throughout the tournament on es-

capes. His famed sit-out escape
was relatively ineffective against
Steenlage and he also lost his
riding position on several op-
ponents. In his 8-5 semi-ﬁnal win
against Penn State’s Steve Erber,
who escaped ﬁve times.

Steenlage, a junior from Britt,
Iowa, had an 11-0-1 record this
year and also showed good poise
defeating Lehigh‘s Joe Peritore
1-0 in an overtime serni-ﬁnal
match. Johnson and Peritore
were seeded ﬁrst and second, re-
spectively, but the scrappy cadet
stupiﬁed fans by beating them.

Lee "Hall won third place in the
177-pound division with a 2-0 de-
feat of Lehigh’s Ron Bushner.
Hall had been one of the top
contenders for the title, but the
bull-like Schlendorf overpower-
ed him in the semi-ﬁnals. Schlen-
dorf and Hall had a draw during
the season.

Tracksters Lack Reputation

By RON SHEARER

A University athletic squad tried to
make the “big time” last Saturday in the
IC4A track and ﬁeld championships. Again
it failed. .

In ﬁnishing in a three-way tie for 22nd
place with Boston College and Providence,
the track team followed a long line of Pan-
ther teams which have almost, but not quite,
reached greatness.

Why does track remain a secondary sport at
this psuedo-Ivy League University, when schools
such as Penn, Harvard, Cornell, and Yale consi-
der the sport important enough for a half a
dozen pages in the Annuals and full University
backing at meets?

This reporter overheard a conversation be-
tween writers of a prominent Philadelphia and
a prominent New York daily at the recently held
IC4A competition. In running down the preview
of competitors,,the two chanced upon one of the
few Panther runners in the event. With a laugh,
they dismissed him from contention; “University
of Pittsburgh, they never win anything!”

Why doesn’t Pitt ever win anything?

There are probably as many answers to that
question as there are dollars in the University
deﬁcit. At various times, people have blamed the
trimester system, the administration, the coach-
‘mg, the athletes themselves, the high tuition.
Track Coach Carl Rees believes that Pitt just
doesn’t have the reputation in track that other
Eastern schools have, nor are we able to offer
the ﬁnancial aid that they can. Many athletes
are content to go to a school such as Villanova

1:‘ 

and run as a second or third stringer than come to
a school such as Pitt and be a star. At Villanova,
they know they will be invited to all the big
meets and get national exposure.”.

At Kent State University in Ohio, there are
at least six track men from the Pittsburgh area
who could help the Panther squad.

There is reason to believe that these trans-
planted Pittsburghers could not meet the require-
ments demanded by the University. But, if some
of the football players who graduated and were
accepted at our School of Dentistry with the
academic quality point averages they brag about,
then I see no reason why more track men couldn’t
be recruited. ’

When the ruling that athletes participating
in spring sports were not_ compelled to attend
the Spring trimester, was authorized, it looked
like Pitt had a selling point for prospective ath-
letes. Now it develops that the University is in
ﬁnancial trouble and the outlook darkens once
more. Certainly there will be no increase in allot-
ments for ﬁnancial aid to track men, and, there
is a possibility that the budget will even be out.

One bright spot turned up last week when .

Coach Carl Rees announced that Bill De1Vecchio
was invited to complete in the NCAA Indoor
Championships being held in Detroit this past
weekend. He will rlm in the 440-yard run. The
impressive part of this current development is

i that a committee of coaches from Eastern schools

chose the participants from the area.‘ The chair-
man of this committee was none other than the
coach of Villanova, Jumbo Elliot.

We may have a reputation to uphold after all.

school, they knew the entire community.
Here, they have to find a new identiﬁcation,
a new group.

Like any other newcomer to the school, Fresh-
man basketball player Frank Famularo had these
problems. And he had more, too. This the story
of his adjustment. 3

Famularo went from a friendly small town to
a big, cold city. He lives in Fredericktown, a coal
‘nest 50 miles south of here, where the two big-
gest industries are coal mining and relief checks.

“I don’t like the confusion in .a big city,” Fam-
ularo said, folding his hands between his knees.
“It seems like there’s so much traffic here. Every-
body’s so busy that they don’t have time totalk.”
THEN HE lifted is head and appealed with his
eyes, “I guess I could get accustomed to the city,"
he said, “but I don’t like it.

“It’s different in a small town,” he continued.
“I like a small town. You know. It has grass and
trees and you can sit around and have nothing to
do and still like it.

“Maybe the city has a lot to offer,” he said
apologizing for Pittsburgh, “but it doesn’t have
what I want. I have most of my friends at home.”

In Fredericktown on a Friday night, you don’t
go to a movie; you go ‘to the bar or the basket-
ball game. Most of Famularo’s friends went to
the basketball games. Fredericktowners would go
to the basketball games at Beth—Center High
School, and listen for Frank Famularo’s name,

and they would look for his number. And when _

the public address announcer would call out,
“Field goal, Famularo,” his father could look
around the stands and say, “That’s my boy.” And
everybody was happy, because they all knew him.

When Frank Famularo scored 30 points in a
high school game, people knew it._ He would go to
school the next Monday, and his friends would
pat him on the back and say, “Good game,
Frankie,” and he would feel tall inside.

‘Here he scored 30 points against Slippery Rock
one night. He said that it felt great to perform so
well, but no one here even knows that Pitt has a
freshman basketball team. So no one patted him
on the back, and he went on to his studies Sun-
day night as if he had never played the game.
FAMULARO SPENDS a lot of his time in his
room. The trimester system overwhelmed him.
“It’s a lot harder here than I expected,_” Famu-
laro said. He has a lot of work to do, and less
time in which to do it.

“I just can’t get behind,” Famularo said. “If
I do, I’m done. I don’t even have the time to so-
cialize any more.”

He says he spends a lot of time studying, but

he still ran into academic problems. He failed
Spanish. As a result, he now has a 2.06 QPA for
his ﬁrst term. But that hasn’t disturbed the 5-foot-
11 inch guard too much. He is now repeating the
course, and has a B average in it. That, he says
will bring his average to around 2.8.
ALTHOUGH HE has had some academic difficulty
here, Famularo is still happy about having chosen
Pitt instead of one of the other schools that were
interested in him. “Sometimes I get depressed
with this place,” he said. “I get to wishing I was
around home more.” So sometimes he wishes he
had gone to California State Teacher's College, or
Waynesburg.

- But Famularo knew that those schools, or even
a school like Penn State, couldn't give him the
academictraining he needed.” In .a way I'm glad
I came here,” he said. He’s glad because when he
completes his undergraduate work, he can go on
to dental school here. If he were at Waynesburg,
it would be harder for him to go to dental school.

“But I knew I would have a better future if I
came here. My Dad decided that. And he was
right.”

When he spoke about his father, there was a
hollowness in his voice. “These dorms are pretty
cold,” he said, referring to the impersonal atmos-
phere of the Towers. “I miss my parents. Not as
much as I thought I would, but I still miss them.

This place isn’t like home.” Last term, he went .
home ﬁve times in 14 weeks. He says he misses

‘ his mother’s cooking, and his friends.

5.1”‘-

BUT FAMULARO has to realize that he may never
live at home again for an extended period of time,
and he’s having trouble accepting the idea. “I
really like to go back home,” he said. “But I have
to get used to being away from it. I'm trying to
get used to freedom.”

He thinks he’s adapting himself as well ascan
be expected. “You know, I’m starting to get used

behind his head, and leaned back in his chair.
“You know, college life can really spoil you. It
really prepares you for being independent. I feel
much better about being away from home now
than I did at the beginning of the year.”

Despite this lift in spirits, Famularo still found
it hard to play basketball here. One reason he had
problems was his chronic ankle injury. He has in-
jured the same ankle 13 times; the most recent
injury coming during Christmas vacation. He was
playing basketball at home, and carrie down on the
side of his foot. The injury kept him frorn playing
at full strength in some games during the second

» half of the season.

He’s tired of his ankle problem, and wishes he

were ﬁnally rid of it, so he jumps rope to strength-
en his ankle. - _
FAMULARO, WHO says he practices as often as
he can now, did. not practice at all lastsummer.
He says that kept him from being a better basket-
ball player. His assistant coach, Tim Grgurich,
agrees, “The summer can make or break a player,"
the former Panther regular said. “The guys who
play a lot in the summer are generally the guys
who look good when they come up in October.”

“Freshman ball is much harder than high
school ball,” Famularo said. “Especially A if you
want to start. Everyone who comes out for the

~ team was a star in high school. That means that

you have to be that much greater when you play.”
THEN HE said nothing for a while. He pondered
over his next words. He started to speak, then he
stopped. Then he started and stopped .again. He
starred at the blank wall of his room.

“You know,” he said, “The record of a« team

depends a lot on the school. I mean the players
have to have something to look forward to. It
really gets me discouraged to play freshman ball
here..
“YOU GO out onto the court, and you play before
an empty Field House. And the only guy who cares
whether you win or lose is your dad.” Famularo
laid his chin in the palms of his hands and con-
tinued to start at the blank wall. “It really gets
me discouraged,” he said. “You can feel the de-
pression in the team. It’s like there’s nothing to
ﬁght for.”

It upsets Famularo that students here don’t
support the basketball team. Because of the stu-
dent attitude, he is dissatisﬁed with Pitt. “You
go to other schools, and you can see the difference.
There’s a lot of enthusiasm there. Here, everyone
just cares- about his own little group. Students
should stick by their school and help it.”

THEN HE pulled open a drawer and slammed it
shut. “Heck, if I knew Pitt students were going to
be like that, I never would have come here.”

F.amu1aro is dissatisﬁed with the social life
here, as well as the student attitude. “This school
really hurts for a campus,” he said.

“I was worried when I came here,” he con-
tinued, “but in some ways Pitt seemed pretty
great. But this school is socially poor. If yoh don’t
have a car, it really hurts.”

Frank Famularo doesn’t have a car. He doesn’t
like the social life here. He failed his language his
ﬁrst term, and he doesn’t like the city. But he,
like most other freshmen, is getting used to living
with some of his problems, and overcoming others.
Basketball coach Bob Timmons is waiting for
him. If Famularo can ﬁnish making his 'adjust-_

development  

The road to management is a two-way street at
Ford Motor Company. On one side of the street,
the college graduates brings to us his. talents, -
abilities and ambitions. Then it is up to us to
ensure that he realizes his full potential.

There are several methods we use in guiding his
development. One method is periodic evaluations.
These reviews measure performance and—more
importantly—chart the best route for an employe
to pursue in developing his capabilities. These
performance reviews are prepared at least once

a year by the employe’s immediate supervisor,
reviewed by higher management and discussed with the employe.

In addition, there are frequent reviews and analyses of individual perform-
ance in which promotions, salary increases and developmental moves are
planned. These programs are so important that each division and staff has a
special section responsible for administering them. One of the people who
helps oversee these programs is Toby Kahr. His experience is also an
example of how a college graduate beneﬁts from these programs.

In 1963, Toby completed our College Graduate Program. During these
ﬁrst two years, he gained a depth of experience in Company policies involv-
ing all aspects of employe relations. Currently he supervises the Personnel
Planning and Training Section of our Steel Division. In essence, Toby is
helping to implement the program that led to his own career development.

Programs such as these are intended to make certain that your perform-
ance at Ford Motor Company will be recognized and will determine how
fast you’ll move ahead. The development of future managerial material is
one of our fundamental goals. See our representative when he visits your
campus. Something good may develop for you.
