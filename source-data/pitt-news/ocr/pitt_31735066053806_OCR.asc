Allocations chairman accused

SGB alleges Gerald Klayman funnelled thousands to bogus organizations

Lisa Grzyboski &
Anthony Breznican
The Pitt News

Gerald Klayman — student govem-
ment allocations chair and presidential
candidate — has resigned from both posi-
tions amid SGB allegations that during the
summer he funnelled thousands of dollars
from the student activities fund into bogus
organizations for his own beneﬁt.

Klayman said he resigned both posi-
tions because, “I became so consumed in
campaigning  that I became a person I
didn’t want to be.” He would not comment
on the allegations of ﬁscal impropriety.

He did say that “no money was spent”

before terminating the phone interview.

Board members Ryan Weidenmiller
and Marquette Bowman say they found
allocations documents Monday that they
say show Klayman approved funding for
bogus organizations.

They have refused to turn over those
documents to The Pitt News. SGB
President Justin DalMo1in said that after
the documents were reviewed by SGB
they were turned over to the Oﬂice of
Student Activities for further investigation.

Board members said the appropria-
tions were made without their knowledge
because the requests were for less than
$500. Year—round, the board only reviews
requests for more than that amount.

According to student
government guidelines,
Klayman is solely responsi-
ble for approving funds for
organizations over the sum-
mer while the rest of the
committee is away.

Sources close to SGB
estimate Klayman allegedly
approved $7,000 to the
organizations in question.

Joyce Giangarlo, SGB
advisor, said she was not sure how much
of the money can still be accounted for.
Some of the money was simply approved
— not given —— to the organizations, she
said.

Gerald Kman

She said that on the sur-
face, the funding requests
were legitirnate but that the
money was not necessarily
spent on what was docu-
mented.

SGB Business Manager
Brian Riemer will act as
interim allocations chair
until a new one is found,
said Giangarlo.

At least four organiza-
tions are being investigated, according to
Giangarlo, but she could not reveal the
names pending further investigation by the

In past years at Holland Hall's Haunted House, it took a lot of guts to face the scores.

Holland Hall's Haunted House
features screams, special effects

Christal Hall
For The Pitt News

Even though the movie Scream
came out only two years ago, Holland
Hall’s Haunted House has been mak-
ing Pitt students shriek in terror for
the past 20 years.

Coordinators Nicole Anton, trea-
surer of Holland Hall; and JoAnn
Pereira, vice president of Holland
Hall, began planning this . year’s
haunted house in September by send-
ing letters to different student organi-
zations asking them for volunteers to
build it and for money to purchase
supplies. 1

Then they assigned committees to
decorate the haunted house, manage
the volunteers and put together skits.

Finally, they decided on Frank
Opiloto’s Cleveland special-effects
group, “CNF Effx,” to help with deco-
rations, makeup for volunteers work-
ing in the house, fake corpses and spe-
cial effects.

“CNF Effx will make a more real-
istic scare for students,” said Anton.

The haunted house’s spooky path
is one—quarter mile long, in the cata-
combs of North Holland Hall. Thrill
seekers will start beneath North
Holland and work their way to the

Forbes Avenue loading dock next to
the 7-Eleven.

The labyrinth of hallways leading
students to multiple rooms of spooks
hold another scary surprise: dressed-
up, made-up volunteers who jump out
of the nooks and crannies of the halls
to scare students walking through the
house. ‘

There are “at least a few hundred
students” who see the house every
year in Schenley Quad, according to
Anton. To get into the haunted house,
a person only needs to be a Pitt stu-
dent with a valid Pitt ID.

While people wait in line to get in,
there will be a “Fall Fling” in the quad
to entertain people. There will be free
food, beverages and games. Also, a
few Pittsburgh Steelers will be there
from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. signing auto-
graphs and walking through the
crowd. DJ Leon Paul from WPTS—FM
will be there from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m.,
and the band Left on Dorris will be
performing from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m.
There will also be a table set up to
allow persons to register to vote.

“I’m hoping to bring a diverse
group of students from every race,
ethnicity and culture together to show
them that we can get along together as
a whole on the campus,” said Anton.

‘ for

any issues he pleased before the ﬂoor
was opened to questions. Nearly all
hopefuls addressed issues of SGB-to-
student communication, residence life,
allocations and ﬁnancial aid. They also
addressed using The Pitt News in com-
munications.

In her speech, Klein stated students
at Pitt “aren’t apathetic, aren’t ignorant.
But one thing they are is frustrated.” Her
platform includes surveys of student
wants and needs, along with working
with administration on critical issues. _

Keiser stressed the importance of
her slate, “Access ‘98,” an acronym for
Aid, Communication, Community,
Education, Services and Safety.

Mongell proposed the concept of
online or telephone class scheduling.

He also said, “I know I can represent
the University because the University
represents me.”

Meyers feels she has “a passion to
make a difference and a passion to
inspire others.” One of her slate mates,
Murphy, concurred with her quest for
initiatives to better Pitt in his speech.
The third slate mate, Tekel, also
expressed his feelings on unifying the
student body.

Friedberg relayed his idea to open a
Second Plate-type establishment that
would operate 24 hours a day. His slate,
“A Better Campus,” stressed student
needs. Valsamidis, under the same slate,
pitched his vision of increased student

involvement. .

“Students should know what goes
on on the sixth ﬂoor of the union,” said
Wright. She spoke of experience on the
Academic Affairs committee and her
intent to encourage diversity.

I Broz and Wisnosky brought to the
front the idea of vouchers for student
activities’ funding that students could
give to organizations of their choice.

Park, a freshman, said that he would
offer himself as an outlet for- students for
any of their needs, “even relationship
problems.”

Karch emphasized her time on the
U.S. and Pennsylvania state student
associations and her accomplishments
within them.

Looking past just Pitt was the
premise for Byron Woodson’s speech,
where he related his vision for Pitt and
the local community.

The Gargoyle Party, Hudac and
Gielata, restated their intent to push for
Gargoyles on the Cathedral in a speech
given by Hudac, since Gielata relin-
quished his time to give Hudac two extra
minutes. After the event was done,*they
staged a presentation on their origins and
beliefs which included Hudac spitting
fire in time with Gielata’s comments.

They called it “an example of how
we can brutally slaughter student apathy
in its sleep.”

Elections for both SGB Board and
President will be held Nov. 5.

Teeters came under scrutiny during
the question and answer period for not

through.

He replied by asking one student
questioner to list the programs he has
started and not followed up. As for his
absence from SGB meetings, he said the
board opted to schedule the meetings at a
time when he has a night class.

Gerald Klayman, the present
Allocations Committee chair, withdrew
his presidential candidacy early in the
day.

KLAYMAN

Ofﬁce of Student Activities.

Hinting that there may be more people
implicated in the future, she referred to
these events as the “saddest of [her] life
experiences here.” '

Allocations Committee Advisor Teny
Milani, who directly oversees Klayman,
said that because the Oﬁice of Student
Activities has had only two days to inves-
tigate the allegations, it is “a premature
judgment” to accuse Klayman of embez-
zlement.

“We are diligently working towards
finding out all the facts, and we will get all
the issues using the records available,” he
said. “If he has violated a student code of
conduct, then disciplinary charges will be

FROM PAGE 1

ﬁled.”

Giangarlo, however, said she is certain
that disciplinary actions will be taken
against Klayman when the investigation is
complete. She commented that she would
not rule out that criminal charges may be
ﬁled.

Robert Gallagher, interim vice chan-
cellor for Student Affairs, said the matter
“broke my heart” early yesterday.

DalMolin, speaking on behalf of the
entire Student Government Board,
armounced yesterday evening that the
investigation into the handling of the stu-
dent activities fees was now being pursued
only by the Office of Student Activities.

money was handled,” he said. “SGB feels
this is obviously very unfortunate. We feel
this is out of our hands now.”

DalMolin stated the board was not
sure which organizations were involved or
how the money was handled. -

Milani would not specify what type of
action would be taken against Klayman,
saying it is “premature to discuss the out-
comes until the investigation is complet-
ed.” He also would not divulge informa-
tion of his meeting with Klayman on
Tuesday.

Joe Cavalla, the director of student
activities, would not comment on the
alleged impropriety.

“At this time we are not prepared to
make a statement regarding the alleged
misuse of funds,” he said.

Full disclosure of
investigation needed

Jerry Klayman told The Pitt News’ opinions editor
about ﬁve weeks ago that he felt unfairly treated by the
student population. He said he had done nothing wrong
involving the last student government scandal, but
because his name was on the documents and hence in the
news stories, people were unfairly associating him with
the wrong—doings to which he said he did not contribute.

Guilt by association, he said.

Klayman and every student government member ‘

who felt the same way should have spoken out. They
should have separated themselves from the accused or
defended them. But they didn’t. They kept quiet. And
their silence tarnished them in the public eye whether it
was justified or not.

Well, there’s a new scandal, and Klayman has been
directly implicated. ‘ .

Everybody else who has been anywhere near this
incident should speak up about it. Keeping quiet, waiting
for it to go away, isn’t the answer. If he’s innocent, say
so, and prove it. If he is guilty, again, campus deserves
proof and full disclosure. »

People will inevitably associate everyone in student
government, as well as its advisors, with this incident.
They probably shouldn’t, but they will.

Anyone who is not guilty has to say so and has to
prove it by questioning those who are involved. They
have to make it clear that they are not trying to cover up
anything just because Klayman or somebody else
involved is their friend. .

As students of this university who pay the $80 stu-
dent activities fee each year, we deserve to know exact-

ly where the money is going. We need to know how ,

those allocations have been justiﬁed. Those who control
that money have to be held accountable. And those who
)VC['SCC them have to see that through.

The last investigation was kept quiet from students.
N 0 details were released. That only served to look like a
cover-up —— even if it wasn’t, it sure looked like one.

Student government leaders, advisers and University
administrators all have a duty now to disclose the details
of all forthcoming investigations. Student government
members especially have to speak out about this alleged
misuse of power. If they don’t want to be associated with
it, keeping quiet is just going to belittle them in the pub-
lic e e. «

l¥ull disclosure. That’s all we ask. Give us the truth.

columnlst

Chances are, in the past few
weeks, you and I, and every other
person in southwestern
Pennsylvania have been bombard-
ed with so much politics concem-

‘ing the Regional Renaissance

Initiative that you are either sick of
hearing about it, or your common
sense is clouded from the amount
of rhetoric spewing from the
mouths of people like Lyrm Cullen
and Jim Quinn.

Most people who oppose the
RRI fall into one of two categories:
the "I-just—don’t-want-to-pay-
extra—taxes” category, or the “noth-
ing-needs-to—be-ﬁxed-anyway"
C3t€g0fY-

I support the RRI because it is
asmallpricetopayforwhatitis
estimated it will bring to this
region: over 30,000 new jobs and
over $90 million in additional tax
revenue. For those of us who plan
on spending at least part of our
lives here, those ﬁgures are very
promising.

And, in case you’re wonder-
ing, not everything is taxed.
Several daily necessities, such as
toilet paper, unprepared food and
utilities, will remain at 7 percent.

It is even more promising to
know that those ﬁgures are conser-
vative, according to a recent three-
month study conducted by the
University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie
Mellon University, Duquesne
University and Price Waterhouse.
Unfortunately, the results of this
study have not been as highly pub-
licized as the grossly insulting term
coined by opponents: “stadium
tax.”

The Pitt News

Opponents have used the “sta-
dium tax” rebuttal to gain support
and portray the RRI as a superﬁ-
cial and selﬁsh luxury to please
Dan Rooney and Kevin
McClatchy. In reality, the revenue
will be used for two funds, region-
al destination and regional growth.
These include frmding new stadi-
ums as well as expanding the
David L.’ Lawrence Convention

Center, improving the Cultural

District, building industrial parks,
improving transportation, water
and sewer facilities, and tourist
activities.

This is not a “stadium tax,”
and the taxpayers should not
accordingly be divided into sports
fans and non-sports fans.

Another tactic used by oppo-
nents is that instead of blowing out
of proportion the supposed ﬁnan-
cial burden of the tax on everyone,
they question the need for the
improvements in the ﬁrst place.
They ask: “Why do we need the
tax anyway?”

They have cleverly answered
this question themselves by claim-
ing that economically, the state of
affairs in the region is satisfactory.

The truth is that Pittsburgh is
lagging behind other regions in
economic development. Cyril H.

’ Wecht, as a guest columnist for the

Post-Gazette, states it a bit more
bluntly: “The hard, unvarnished
truth is that in the competitive
struggle for growth and develop-
ment among communities in post-
World War II America, we have
had our tails whipped badly by
cities that were just small towns 50
years ago.”

One of the problems exacer-
bating the economic decline is the

THE PITT NEWS

recent lack of competitive business
in part of the David L. Lawrence
Convention Center. When it was
built in 1981, the Convention
Center served its purpose. In 1997,
it is too small and inconvenient for
prospective major businesses to
even consider using it. In addition,
the two major organizations that
used the Convention Center this
year, the NAACP and AFL—CIO,
have already decided against com-
ing back again due to the lack of
space, again according to the Post-
Gazette.

If we could expand the David
L. Lawrence Convention Center,
important and preﬁtable business-
es and organizations would be
more attracted to the area. Other
cities with bigger and better con-
vention centers would actually
face eompetition from Pittsburgh.
But, until that happens, prospec-
tive convention holders will con-
tinue to turn up their noses.

Finally, if Pittsburgh gets new
football and baseball stadiums, it is
hard to believe that this could actu-
ally have a negative effect. IfThree
Rivers Stadium continues to be
used by the Pirates and the
Steelers, sooner or later the need
for repairs will be absolutely nec-
essary and far more expensive than
they would be now. The reality is
that competition among major-
league sports is intense and sorne—
times unreasonable to me, but los-
ing any of our teams would have a
grave atfect on Pittsburgh and the
surrounding areas as well.

Support the Initiative.

Alison Novicki is a proud member
of the Community Alliance for
Economic Development and Jobs.

I remember growing up and looking
at my mother’s high-school yearbook.

I laughed at her coitfed hairdo and
polyester bell bottoms, but what stuck
out the most were the random highlight-
ed pictures through out the book.

When I asked my mother what their
signiﬁcance was, she told me that they
were pictures of classmates who had
passed away.

I didn’t understand at the time how
someone so young could die.

Why did it have to happen to some-
one with so much ahead of them?

I was 18 years old the ﬁrst time a
person close to me passed away.

My great—grandfather was 80-plus
years old, which made understanding his
death easier for me.

A year later I lost my great-grand-
mother. Even though I knew that her pain
was over, I still was left with an empty
feeling of confusion and frustration.

That feeling resurfaced during my
sophomore year in college when I
learned that a friend of mine was acci-

_ dentally shot and killed by one of his best

friends.

Here was the first person I knew my
own age who was taken from this world.

The next year a friend of mine com-
mitted suicide while talking on the phone
to his girlfriend — another tragedy that
left friends and family with no explana-
tion.

At the beginning of the fall semester
last year, a high-school classmate of
mine was shot and killed on the campus
of Penn State University.

That empty feeling came over me
again.

It returned Sunday night, when I
learned of the death of Pitt student Ryan
Steppacher.

Ryan was a good friend of mine, as
he was to hundreds of other people
across campus.

The rugby team lost one of its gutsi-
est teammates.

The brothers of Phi Gamma Delta
lost a member of their family.

The University of Pittsburgh lost one
of its most popular students, a man who
always had a smile on his face.

It’s simply not fair.

Those people who knew Ryan are
now feeling the empty feeling associated
with tragedies like this.

They must cope with the confusion

Pitt Hoops preps for scrimmage vs. All-Stars

The college basketball season could
not come any sooner for Pitt basketball
fans, who watched the men’s team pile up
an 18-15 record during the 1996-97 sea-
son and earn a bid to the National
Invitational Tournament.

Pitt will look to pick up where it left
off when it faces the California All-Stars
in an exhibition matchup on Sunday at
5:00 p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House.

This season, the Panthers could either
stand to become a dominant power in the
Big East or plummet to the depths of
despair, where they have dwelled the past
few seasons.

However, to become a contender in
the Big East, the Panthers will have to
overcome some early-season obstacles.

Thankfully, Head Coach Ralph
Willard went out and recruited one of the
top recruiting classes in the country,
again.

The Panthers will be a young, inex-
perienced team, but they have the leaders
it will take to rank them among the best in
the Big East.

Junior guard Vonteego Cummings
and sophomore guard Kellii Taylor are
becoming one of the best backcourt duos
in the country. Curmnings with his accu-
rate shot and Taylor with his quickness
will head up a young Panther team this
season. Sophomore Jarrett Lockhart will

be a force off the bench for Pitt.

The backcourt is pretty strong, but
the Panthers are lacking depth in the
frontcourt.

Sophomore forward Isaac Hawkins
is the only forward returning to the team.
However, Hawkins showed last season
— especially during the Big East
Tournament —— that he can step up and
score points (or trade elbows) underneath.

Hawkins will receive help from the
highly-touted recruiting class. Six-foot-
nine Attila Cosby will add his athleticism
and speed to a thin forward position. Also,
6-foot-8 Stephen Flores adds a steady
passing game, 6-foot-8 Kevin Leslie will
grab rebounds, and 6-foot-8, 230-pound
Michael Shin will add muscle.

Freshman guard Ricardo Greer, who
is too big for a guard to handle and too
fast for a forward to catch, and John

add to the Panther attack.

contest against Marathon Oil on Nov. 9

“EXCEPT NEW RELEASES“

Thursday, 30 October 1997

When you get into November, things
in college football naturally start to get
clearer. This week, teams will ﬁnally get
knocked out of the Top 25 and/or bowl
contention. We’ll start with a team who
started to slide last week 

Ohio State at Michigan State (+6)

This is the top level of the Big Ten
against the middle of the pack in the Big
Ten. Ohio State is at the top level, along
with Penn State and Michigan. Michigan
beat the Spartans pretty easily last week
with thanks to a dominating defense — and

 Ohio State is quite capable of doing the

same thing.
Ohio State 21, Michigan State 10

Illinois (+4) at Indiana
Now we go from the top and middle of
the Big Ten to the very bottom. These aren’t

~ just the two worst teams in the Big Ten, they

‘-_.

might be two of the ﬁve worst teams in all
of Division I-A. The Big Ten is not a high-
scoring conference, but you still wouldn’t
expect it to be home to the two lowest-scor-
ing teams in the country. Here’s an interest-
ing statistic: Indiana’s and Illinois’ com-
bined point total so far this season is lower
than any other single team in the confer-

,. ence. The Big East may be bad, but Illinois

 

vs. Indiana makes Temple vs. Rutgers look
like Tennessee vs. Florida.

Washington State leads Moak’s week-IO pack

    

West Virginia (+1 at Syracuse

I’m wondering whether somebody
knows something that I don’t know about
this game. West Virginia has the nation’s
best running back, a solid defense, and as of
right now, the inside track on the Big East
championship. Syracuse is rounding into
form after its customary early season choke
job, but the Orangemen haven’t played a
real game (Rutgers and Temple don’t
count) in a month. Syracuse is good enough
to win this game, but not to win by 10.

Miami of Ohio (+1 1/2) at Toledo

Get a load of this: A Mid—American
Conference game with bowl implications!
This game means more to Toledo than it
does to  If Toledo wins, it will go
undefeated this season because it doesn’t
play any other team with anything near a
winning record after this. Miami does.
Miami plays Ohio University next week
and still has a game against Marshall. Those
happen to be the other two good teams in
the MAC.
Toledo 38, Miami 17

       
   
     

Pitt (+4) at Boston College

Picking Panther games is a lot like
walking across a mine ﬁeld. After last
week, we know that no team is too bad for
Pitt to lose to. There probably are, however,
tean1sthataretoogoodforPitttobeat.
Three such teams — Syracuse, Virginia
Tech and West Virginia — complete the
Panthers’ schedule after the Boston College
game. This is Pitt’s last realistic chance at a
victory this season.

This Week’s Best Bet:
Washington State (+3) at Arizona State
It’s the Pac-lO’s best olfense (and that
says something) against its best defense
(that’s not saying much). Washington State
has one of the most explosive offenses in
the country, maybe second only to

it has given up its share of yardage. The Sun

against the Cougars.

something that coaches don’t teach you in
high school. It’s hard to make the transition
from high school to college.”

But Flaus is pleased with his star play-
er’s progress at Pitt.

“From what Kevan tells me it sounds
like he has really adapted,” says Flaus.
“The staff at Pitt is pleased with his
progress, and he’s doing OK grade-wise as
well.”

Barlow cites his high school coach as

FROM PAGE 7

one of his greatest inﬂuences.

“He’s like a godfather to me,” Barlow
says, grinning. “He calls me just about
every other day. I go over to his house for
dinner. I hang out with his son Matt. He
helped me get into Pitt, and he’s helped me
so muc .”

Harris and his staff are assuming a role
similar to Flaus’ , but without the father-ﬁg-
ure aspect.

“Kevan’s gone through a real good

learning experience,” said Harris. “I think i

that being a high school player and going to
play at the college level in a scholarship
program has been a tremendous change.
011” the ﬁeld, we’re trying to get Kevan
used to what college life is all about, the
expectation level of being a good student
and having all the classes that he has.”

But Harris already focuses on the
future for Barlow.

“We’re real pleased with the point he’s
at, and we also know that he’s still got a
long way to go.”

a two—yard touchdown pass against
Rutgers last week.

On the other side of the ball, the
Panthers will have a tough test putting a
stop to the Golden Eagles offense, which
is ranked second in the Big East. The
Panthers come into the game with the sec-
ond—worst-ranked defense in the Big East
behind Rutgers —— no surprise after last
week’s shootout.

Now that Frank Moore and Roderick
Humphrey have one game under their
belts, the defense should improve.

“We need to be physical on defense.
We have to make it happen on third
down,” Harris said.

Harris then alluded to Boston
College’s running game, saying that
“We’ve got to control [it] this week.

ame.”

In fact, Humphrey and company will
have to stop the Big East’s second—lead—
ing rusher. Mike Cloud averages nearly
100 yards per game and 6.3 yards per
carry.

Not only must the Panthers stop
Cloud, but the Golden Eagles also ‘have
Oman Walker in their arsenal. Walker is
the seventh-leading rusher in the Big
East, averaging 70 yards per game and
ﬁve yards per carry.

Moore and fellow pass rusher Marlin
Young will be chasing Golden Eagles
quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, who is the
ﬁfth-rated passer in the big East.
Hasselbeck has big—play potential, having
passed for over 1,400 yards this season.
However, Moore and Young will be lin-
ing up against an offensive line that boasts
two 300—pounders. Doug Brzezinski and
Noah LaRose anchor an excellent offen-
sive front for Boston College.

has been effective. Cloud stepped in
when Walker went down and has rushed
for 681 yards and six touchdowns.

Throw in a solid offensive line and
senior Todd Pollack, who has estab-
lished himself as one of the premier tight
ends in the Big East, and you have the
Big East’s second—rar1ked team in total
yards of offense.

This could be a problem for the
Panthers considering that they gave up

48 points to Rutgers last Saturday.

Pitt leads the all-time series with a
12-9 record, including last year’s ESPN-
televised horror show on Halloween
Night.

sloppy game, allowing Boston College

and pain that follows the loss of a loved
one.
Many people will be asking them-
selves why —- but the answer will never
be found.

In his poem “When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard Bloom’d,” Walt Whitman
focuses on death and the learning that
can be done to help heal the wounds suf-
fered when someone close to you passes
away.

I think that this is what the
University of Pittsburgh community,
along with the friends, fraternity broth-
ers, and teammates of Ryan Steppacher,
can do.

Think about what has happened and
grow from it.

A friend of mine commented to me
Sunday night about how frightening it is
to think about how college kids harbor a
sense of invincibility. ‘

We think that we are immune from
events like this.

We are not.

Think about the senseless things we
do that put the lives of people in danger.
Things that we do without even thinking
twice about them.

We are ignorant and selﬁsh.

Someone that so many people knew
and cared for had to die for us to think

‘W —‘~'«»« 4» :¢.m.v.,.:»,

about how much things mean to us and
how careful we should be.

Since Sunday, I have not stopped
thinking about how much the people in
my life mean to me.

I feel guilty doing so.

I feel like I don’t appreciate the peo-
ple in my life as much as I should.

Worst of all, I feel that soon the
thoughts will go away, only to return the
next time something like this happens.

However, like Whitman suggested, I
have started to think about my ﬁiends
and family more.

I have thought about the possibility
that the next time I see them could be the
last.

Needless to say, one can’t live life
looking over his shoulder, but what can
be done is simple.

Be honest to yourself and the people
you love.

Don’t be afraid to tell someone how
you feel about them or how much they
mean to you.

Finally, remember people for the
good things they have done, not the petty
arguments or even the most heated of
battles.

Learn from what has happened and
make sure that no one ever becomes just
a highlighted picture in a yearbook.
