The ‘Council of Graduate Stu- .

dents in Education (CGSE) decided
to appoint a steering committee to
oversee the council until a general
council meeting could be held in
the fall. .

Dr. . William Thomas, CGSE
adviser,- suggested at the June 24

meeting that the committee be.

formed to operate in place of the
CGSE executive committee. At a
September meeting, the council
could decide how to rectify the
problems encountered during the
May 13 elections, Thomas said.

Elsie Jackson, a new CGSE
member, made a motion on Tho-
mas’ suggestion before council to
form the committee.

The term of office for the 1981-82
executive committee concluded
June 30, and the newly elected
officers were to take office July 1.
Of the six new CGSE officers, four
have resigned because they con-
sider the May 13 elections invalid.

The latest officer to resign is
CGSE president-elect, Marge Wei-
mer. In her letter of resignation,
read at the June 30 meeting,iWei-
mer said her reasons for not accept-
ing office were were two-fold.

An estimated 1,000 people par-
ticipated in a Market Square rally
in downtown ‘Pittburgh last
Thursday. Some were curious
onlookers, butmost came to sup-
port the continuation of the effort
to pass an amendment to the U.S.
Constitution guaranteeing equal
rights for women.

The event was coordinated by
the YWCA. The speakers included:
Margaret Tyndall, Greater Pitts-
burgh YWCA executive director;
Ann Pride, director, Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape; Bob Pitts,
vice president, NAACP; Molly
Rush, Plowshares Eight activist; as
well as representatives from many
other organizations.

On June 30, time expired for the
passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment. This rally marked a
new beginning in the effort to re-
submit the amendment to Con-
gress as .to get it ratified.

The crowd was enthusiastic and
included both men and women of
various races andlage groups.

Helen Seager expressed her
enthusiasm as she told the crowd,
“I think the best part of this rally is
seeing so many people who were
here last year. ERA won't go away,
and neither will you.”

Seager said a growth process has
taken place in the attempt to get the
ERA pased, and she expressed the
need for tht process to continue.

“During the decade spent push-
ing for ratification, we learned a
lot. Now we can plan anew; we can
apply it conscientiously and effec-
tively,” she said. ,

J She expressed the need for non-

demic and personal reasons.
Between my work and continuing
my course of studies towardsa mas-
ters on a part-time basis, l will not
have adequate time to devote to the
council. V '

“I hold that the May 13 elections
were invalid for several procedural
reasons.”

However, Weimer stated that if
she had the time to devote to the
council and if the recent elections
had been conducted properly, she
would have resigned anyway.

The other 1982-83 ‘officers who
have resigned are Leki-Leki Kat-

’ona, Pat Sokolsky and Matala

Mapela. Only Judy Williams,
elected to the position of member-
at-large and Ethel Parris, elected
secretary, have not resigned.

Because of Weimer’s resigna-
tion, there was no one to replace
Williams as CGSE president last\
week. ,

The June 24 meeting was not
announced formally because of a
communication problem between
Williams and the then-program
coordinator, Arlene Seal.

Williams told council that she
had not realized that the memos
announcing the meeting were not
sent out until two days before the
meeting took place. She had flyers
made and posted them in Forbes

Quadrangle to notify CGSE
members of the scheduled meeting.

When the meeting began, thefe
were only seven council members
in attendance. By 8:30 p.m., two
more had arrived. With nine active
members present, the council
could legally vote on nay. motions
made, according to the CGSE
bylaws.

The CGSE bylaws state that a
quorum (nine active members)

“I am doing this for
both academic and per-
sonal reasons. ...I will
not have adequate
time.”

must be presentfor a motion to be
voted upon and accepted.

Kamal Dora, an active ‘member
and a candidate for the office of
member-at-large, charged that the
meeting was illegal because all
members‘ had not been properly
notified. .

' Despite Dora's protest, the meet-
ing continued.

Williams presented a list, com-

piled by Seal, of all active members
as outlined in the CGSE bylaws.

“I think that there are members
of this council attempting to write
articles in the press, and thereby
promoting factionism in the coun-
cil by their one-sided views,” said-
one CGSE member.

During the meeting, several
other council members said that
articles appeared in The Pitt News
concerning the CGSE elections
were not objective.

Ethel Parris made a motion that

“Judy Williams be extended as‘

president and that I (Parris) be
installed as secretary,” The motion
was later,amended and the second
half deleted.

The motion was seconded and_

put to a vote. It was overturned 5-3..

Williams,’ as president, could only,

vote in the event of a tie.

After this motion was over-
turned, Jackson came forward with
her motion. By this time, two
CGSE members had left the meet-
ing and Jackson’s motion could
not bevoted upon.

Williams, however, decided to
accept a consensus of opinion
regarding the steering committee’.
All attending members were in

favor of forming the steering com-' ’

mittee, which will consist of five
active members.

have the usual problem; we’re the

nell said.

passage of ERA was a divisive tech-
nique to weaken organized labor.

Many who attended the rally
expressed disbelief in the fact that
the ERA has not been passed. One
such participant, Mary Robison,
said the ERA is a crucial issue.

By MARK STROUP
Fate ojvlhe Earth, “the most cri-

ticized book of its kind,” was-

recently discussed as part of the
continuing lecture series spon-

sored by the Arms Race Study

Group.

Robert Norman of the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs lead the discussion of Jona-

than Schell’s book on the possible,

causes and effects of nuclear war.

Schell's Fate of the Earth sees the
possibility of nuclear war as a
symptom of traditional nation-
state rivalries. People who do not
agree at all with the book, Norman
said, are probably offended by that
statement of ScheIl’s.

In the book, Schell says tradi-
tional central governments should
be broken down into smaller, more
localized ones and a world govern-
ment should be formed.

“People are wondering about
how we do what Schell is asking
us,” Norman said.

Some members of the Arms Race
Study Group found fault with
Schell’s inability to. name the
muses of the present-day nuclear’
arms sittntion-

In discussing the reviews of the
book in the Village Voice, the
National Review, The Nation and
other publitations, and listening
tocommentsfromthegroup itself,
Norman said everyone can find
something that they can't agree
with in the book.

However, Norman. generally
regarded the book as being very
insightful.

explained the need for sensitivity to
the concerns of minority groups.
“Throughout the history of the
world, wherever people have

Journalist Says .
War Won’t Work

By MATT HAWKINS

Speaking to an audience of over
100 people at David Lawrence Hall
was Ghassan K. Bishara, a corres-
pondent for Al-Fajr, a Jerusalem
newspaper published by the
Palestinians.

Invited by the Organization of

- Arab Students and the Committee

Against the Invasion of Lebanon,
Bishara spoke on July 2 at 7 p.m.

Bishara shared his insights and
experiences concerning the Palesti-
nian struggle, and reviewed the
current situation in Lebanon. He
also showed a film which con-
trasted the lifestyles of Jewish
Israelis and Palestinians living
together in Israel. The film showed
Palestinian communities, resettle-
ment camps and schools.

In his lecture, Bishara sought to
clarify the situation in the Middle
East and explain the effects of the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon as he
saw it. ’

Documents released by the Gen-
eral Union of Palestinian Students
indicated that 125,000 Israeli sol-
diers utilizing the most sophisti-

cated American-made weaponry

took part in the invasion.
The documents also cited Inter-

national Red Cross figures indicat-
ing that over 18,000 people have

been killed, 95 percent of whom:
were civilians, and an estimated
650,000 people as having been.

Ildisplacwf’. .
The documents also cited Scot-
land yard sources as having con-

firmed that the attempted-

assassination of the Israeli ambas-
sador in London—which the
Israeli government has said trig-
gered the attack on Lebanon--was
not carried out by the PLO, but by

-an “anti—PLO organization.”

The documents also said, as
reported by Bishara, that the Uni-
ted Nations forces in Lebanon con-
firmed that the shelling of north-
ern Israeli settlements by the PLO

came only “in retaliation to Israeli
bombings of Lebanon.”

In an interview before the lec-
ture, Bishara described a number of
towns and refugee camps in South-
ern Lebanon as having been
“totally destroyed, demolished
altogether, gone; just a heap of
rubble."

He said that this is all part of a
campaign by the Israeli govern-

r

ment to eliminate the Palestiriia 0’

people.

“The Israelis are trying to say
that they are liberating Lebanon,”
he said. “It is obvious that their
move into Lebanon was to annihi-

late, and they have said it them- -

selves, to annihilate...the
Palestinians.”

He believes that this is the way in
which Israel proposes toysolve the
problems in the Middle East. He
does not think the approach will
work.

“The PLO is not finished,” he
said. “Historically speaking, there
hasn’t been a national liberation
movement which was militarily

crushed...and it is not goinbvtﬁb

happen this time either.”
He added that “you may crush
the main leaders of the Palestinian.

movement, but there are 4.5 Hlll-.

lion or 5 million Palestinians. You
cannot-kill an idea; you cannot kill
a principle. It’s impossible.”

Bishara said peace in the Middle
East depends on the willingness of
the Israelis to negotiate with the
PLO, and the willingness of the
United States to stop sending wea-
pons to Israel. He said the weapons
shipments encourage Israel to
carry out invasions.
* “The Israelis cannot negotiate
with the Egyptians or the Syrians
‘or the Jordanians or the Saudis-—
they do not represent...the Palesti-
nian people," he said. “It is out of
the question.”

He stated that only the PLO is
recognized by the international

. community as the official represen-

tative of the Palestinian people.

. FORUM:

ls Middle East Peace Possible?

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

In light of the recent conflict
between Israel and the Palestine Lib-

fjlgtion Organization, the Middle East

has once again made front-page
headlines in newspapers all over the
world.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali recently said that “higher
risks of a larger conﬂict loom over
the horizon," implying that the possi-
bility of a “superpowers conﬂict"
could arise because of current hostil-
ities in theMiddle East. Some leaders
of various religious factions believe
the latest ﬁghting could even trigger
an Armageddon.

A number of factors, including
arms sales, oil and most recently,
Secretary of State Haig's resignation
. ‘-“Played a part in postponing
ideast peace. One question cur-
rently being asked is: Will there ever
be peace in the Middle East?

According to Avi Benjamin, secre
tary of information at the Israeli
Embassy, Israel's move into
Lebanon has “increased" the chan-
ces for peace in the Middle East.

"In view of the Israeli operation in
Lebanon," Benjamin said, "the
options for peace in the Middle East
have increased somewhat. Not that
it's not going to require an amount of
diplomatic effort, but the options that
have opened up have greatly
increased (the chance for peace).'’

for’ an appointment:
624-5926.

Even with the latest developments,
though, Benjamin warns there are
too many factors involved to expect
an immediate absolute peace.

"We still have the very basic prob
lems in the Arablsrael situation," he
said. "The Arabs refuse to negotiate
for peace with Israel, because they
refuse to recognize Israel.

"(Then) there is the problem of
arms sales. We feel that (arms are) a
problem wherever they Come from.

"One of the interesting things is
that everyone looks to their own inter-
ests. The lran-lraq war looked in the
beginning that it could take a bigger
direction, but while it was a full-scale
war it became a contained one. The
same is true of the Israel-PLO war in
Lebanon. None of the other Arab
states got involved, which shows that
no one (participants aside) has any
interests."

Although Benjamin believes “it's
too early to _tell" what impact--if
any-—Haig's resignation and George
Schultz's nomination for Secretary of
State will have on the situation, he
thinks the United States should be
involved in the peacemaking
process.

"It' s important that they play a role,
because the United States has
played the most vital role in bringing
about peace in the Middle East in the
past 10 years," Benjamin said.

Dr. Joseph Eaton, professor of
public and international affairs, des-
cribes himself as “very optimistic"

toward the attainment of peace for
the Middle East, and gives four rea-
sons for his attitude:

"One: There's been a progressive
increase in awareness both in the
Middle East and elsewhere that war
doesn't by itself solve complicated
issues of living together. In the Mid-
dle East, there's an awareness on the
part of the Israelis and the Arabs that
there has to be a negotiated
solution."

The second reason is that the Arab
states met and could not agree on a
policy to act toward Israel, which,
according to Eaton, is a good sign.

"By what the Arab states failed to
do," he said, "they are also signaling
that they preper a negotiated solu-
tion to continued military conflict.

"Third: Within Israel, there's strong
forces favoring more negotiations to
bring about a mutually acceptable
autonomy arrangement," he said.

The fourth reason Eaton gives is
that there is at least a chance that the
Soviet Union might get tired of
investing heavily to destabilize the
area.

“They supported the Iraqis and got
little out of it, because the regime was
unable to use Soviet arms to defeat
Iran.

The Syrians are an unstable ally. It
may well be that the PLO might have
been the recipient of not only
enough arms for its roughly 10,000
troops, but many additional supplies

alleged to be sutticient to equip an
army of a million. This may have
been the Russian way of maintaining
a rapid deployment force in the area
to balance the U.S. rapid deployment
strategy.”

A change in the attitudes of many
Arab leaders towards ‘negotiations
for peace is another source of
Eaton’s optimism.

"The Arabs, except the Egyptians,
have refused to enter into serious
negotiations for more than 35
years," Eaton said. “There are now
many Arab leaders who privately
support U.S. (efforts) for a peaceful
as well as viable negotiated solution."

Albert Bloom, president. of the
American Jewish Press Association,
believes there is "hope" for eventual
peace in the Mideast, and thinks the
United States should play a large
role.

The Israeli invasion of Lebanon to
remove the PLO “gave a singular

and single opportunity for the resto-

ration of the sovereignty and safety of

a rebuilt Lebanon, free of all foreign

forces—PLO, Syrian or Israeli. That
is the great opportunity the United
States as the leader of the whole free
world can and must grasp if it has the
wisdom to.see it through,” Bloom
said.

“The U.S. could use its strength
and inﬂuence and good offices to
bring about an amenable adjust-
ment of differences. The United
States is the only country on which

the nations of the Middle East can
relv in their quest for peace.

"Even those countries who disap-
prove of U.S. policies downdeep real-
ize America is the only trustworthy
great power in the world."

The Middle East situation is a com-'
plicated one, according to Bloom,
not only because of the problems
between countries, but the internal
feuding as well.

"When you talk about religious
conﬂict," he said, "you have to realize
there are not only the obvious Chris-
tian, Jewish and Muslim societies-
there are wide differences of
religious interpretations within Islam
itself. Those are subsumed in the
jolts of changing societies. What you
have is kind of a socio-economic
mish-mash.

"I think there’s a chance for peace,
and if the peoples involved grasp that
chance and are aided by the well-
meaning countries of the world,
namely the United States of America,
there is a chance and a hope for
lowering the level of conflict from the '
battleﬁeld to the negotiating table.

“I think Secretary Haig articulated
the lines of effective foreign policy
both in Europe and in the Middle
East and, assuming that these guide-
lines are followed, the prospects on
the road to peace may be gleamed
little by little.

"People are sIck and tired of con-
ﬂict and bloodshed, and it's just time
to stop it."

WHAT TROUBLE7.

WE'RE JUST

LOOK , MY FRIEND)
we DoN‘r WANT
 ANY TRDUELE HERE...

Some Change,
Or The Same ?

  

,.aiiiigg ,,g_g,_‘t..,‘,

-——-4

The more things change, the more they stay
the same——that point was made clear during a
recent press conference held to announce
former assistant chancellor Ed Bozik’s appoint-
ment as Pitt athletic director.

“If our athletic department had needed a
shaking up, we might have gone outside,”
senior vice chancellor for administration Jack
Freeman said. “But we have an outstanding
program, and Ed Bozik is the man who can keep
it strong.”

If things actually remain the same the next
question should be: Is that a good thing?

Former Pitt coach-turned-Texas millionaire
Jackie Sherrill would have balked at the
appointment of Bozik. Sherrill left Pitt with
bitter remarks about interference from Bozik
and Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

That’s not to say that Sherrill was right. A
football team, contrary to what many may
think, is . not an entity separate from _ the
university.

Thus somewhere in between is the tightrope
that a university is forced to walk to strike a
balance between academics and athletics.

It's no secret that big-time football is a big-
time priority at Pitt——now and in the future. A
school doesn't buy stadium lights if it only
intends to play junior colleges.

It's also no secret that pitting academics
against athletics tends to leave many uneasy.
Some argue that the team brings in revenue,
thereby aiding the entire university. Others
maintain the players make a mockery of educa-
tion, getting breaks that other students don't
get. ,

Pitt’s response is inadequate for either side. A

class attendance requirement for athletes has
/been weakened to the point where it can be
conveniently ignored. For those athletes
accepted with the promise that they would
graduate, Pitt still offers below-paritutoring
and counseling services.

Into all this steps a fresh face, but Bozik made
it clear that he was promising only more of the
same. _

“The university will not recruit a young man
or woman who does not have a realistic chance
of graduating,” he said. “This is no different
than in the past, but it’s a principle I intend to
abide by.”

As Bozik’s comments indicate, those who
were looking forward to a new era in Pitt athlet-
ics will have a while to wait.

ERA Death: Discrimination? 

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The ERA is dead! Long live
discrimination!

The Ronald Reagans and Phyl-
lis Schlaflys of the world have been
dancing in the streets over their
grim victory and this country’s dis-
grace. Working women, house-
wives, mothers and all women will
continue to be treated as second-
class citizens by a government that
was structured “for the people.”

How could this atrocity happen
in a free country? Where did we go
wrong? The answers to these ques-
tions are complicated and often
times abstract. The point is, we did
d_o_s_omethi_ng wrong.

For 10 long and bittersweet
years, ERA advocates fought to
preserve one of the rights for which
our forefathers lived and died—the
right to be treated equally no mat-
ter what color, religion, national-
ity or sex an individual might be.

Now that the battle is over, one
can only ask: what is the aversion

some people have to equality? The

15th and 19th Amendments each I
took only a little over a year to
ratify—why did it take 10 years for
the ERA to die such a tortuous
death?

The question still remains, how-
ever, /who is responsible for its
death? Now is the time to drag out
the favorite scapegoat, that red-
eyed devil called society. Society is
easy to blame because it is invisible;
it cannot be singled out and
ostracized.

A friend of mine who says he is
pro-ERA stated recently that he
knows the perfect method for the
ERA to gain sudden popularity
among men in our country. He
said ERA supporters should go
before a men's club and spout the
benefits of the amendment.

“Pass the damn thing and your
wives and girlfriends will have one
less thing to nag you about,” he
said.

Sure, that's funny, even I have to
laugh at it. We were meant to find
humor from situations like that. It
is the way society has taught us.

So long as society is still around,
discrimination will darken our
doorsteps. But that omnipresent
specter is something-with which
we cannot deal; it’s too hard to
change.

So we must find another culprit
in the death of the amendment.
The ERA advocates themselves can
easily be blamed. The wording of
the amendment is vague, compli-
cated and does not mean very
much.

The lobbyists, women's groups

and all the other organizations
failed in getting the message across
to the average citizen.

Many people think ERA means
unisex bathrooms, free abortions
and women fighting in wars. What
the supporter often forgets to men-
tion is credit in a woman's name,
not her husband’s, or equal fund-
ing for organizations that help
women and are funded by the fed-
eral government. The phrase
“equal pay for equal work_” is
being heard less and less often in
this country.

Blame also lies with the oppo-
'nents of the amendment—the
right-wingers, the uninformed, the
discriminators themselves. They
like life the way it is now: women
getting paid 59¢ to every $1 a man
makes. They like the idea of cheap
labor and second-class citizenship.

The psychologists have yet to
figure out the brain of the elite spe-
cies, this All-American animal.
ERA supporters all over the coun-
try groaned when Mr. Reagan was
elected.

The right wing swing .of this
nation pumped the final bullet
into the heart of the amendment. It
staggered for- a year or so, but the
damage was done. The culprits:
Reagan, Schlafly, Baker, Helms,
Hatfield and Heinz, to name but a
few. They are the ones who will be
doing the celebrating in
Washington.

There will also be celebrations in
other parts of the country by the
narrow-minded, the bigots and the

conservatives. They will rejoice in
their victory and look forward to
the country getting back to the
good old days. ,

I suppose the biggest murderer

in this death is the women of this

country—the same women who
would benefit the most from this
legislation. These women are the
amendment’s worst enemy; the
ones who like to be “treated like a
lady.” Why didn’t anyone tell them
that the ERA's passage would not

‘erase the word “lady” from the

dictionaries?

These women will meet with‘

their friends after work and com-
plain about the lousy wages they
are being paid, but they will still‘
denounce the ERA. As long as this
country has women like this, the
ERA will never be a reality.

This is the Equal Rights Amend-
ment’s obituary, its epitaph. It has
made a lot of friends (and enemies)
along the way. It has split families
and spouses; caused classroom
arguments and run political
campaigns.

Our forefathers are looking
down on us and shaking their
heads. We have disappointed them:
their ideals and values have been
compromised. », P‘

This is not goodbye forever,
ERA. Like the Phoenix, you will

rise out of your ashes and become .

stronger than ever. And when you
do, your friends will be here wait-

ing to urge you on in another
battle.

‘Thanks,’ Campus Police

Dear Editor:

While I am the first to admit that
Pitt is not perfect and that some of
its staff are lacking in charm, I feel
compelled to respond to the sweep-
ing generalizations made in the
“strange” letter written by Joseph
Forbes two weeks ago.

In particular, I cannot let his
negative comments about the Pitt
campus police go unchallenged. In
the five years that I have been asso-
ciated with Pitt, I have found the
campus police, without expection,
to be careful, restrained, courteous
and thoroughly professional in
every way. ‘

I have seen them transport sick
students to the hospital, offer
extensive security programs in the
dorms, lend engraving tools to stu-
dents to mark their belongings and
patrol obscure parts of the campus
at all hours of the night.

I found it quite reassuring to see
a campus police officer patrolling

my area when I was working in an
office late at night.

In addition, they have alway‘
' been quite helpful and willing to .

do such things as unchain doors to
let me into abuilding to retrieve
things from my office or whatever.

I also feel that it is worth men-
tioning__the community involve-
ment of these officers. The campus
police have, for instance, been
active supporters of the Hand-In-
Hand Festival since its inception.
They have even gone so far as to set
up their own booth, and they will-
ingly submitted to being the targets
of water-pistol wielding little kids.

How many students can claim
equal involvement and concern?
Not many, I think. In conclusionﬁ
submit that the campus police a I
long overdue for some thanks and
respect.

' \*;<\

Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) gazes lovingly at his wife,
Adrian.(Talia Shire), in “Rocky IlI.’’ ‘

  RockyIII:    

  Down For

The fact that “Rocky III” was ever
attempted provides cynics reason
enough to bear arms and ravage the
movie, its makers and the “vending
machine” of an industry .that
encourages such movie marketing.
“Rocky IIl,” fails disastrously,
,thwarting any attempt by those sur-
rendered to romanticism to come to
its rescue.

True, the story originally
appealed to our love of the under-
dog and yes, given our naivete, we
wallowed in sequel, but wait,
“Rocky III?’ in all ‘its preposterous-
ness, amounts to nothing more than
a cleft reach for America’s wallets.

Not only does “Rocky lII” fail to I

portray any new or interesting side
to this populist myth, it als does a
poor job rehashing those already
seen. “Rocky III” begins, as did
“Rocky II,” with the closing fight
scenes of its predecessor. Then,
instead of allowing the audience any
parts in. the movie, it féregoes plot
development in favor of a series of
quick vignettes, split screens and
still shots that regurgitate the entire

v conﬂict onto our laps, leaving us to

ask only one question—“When will
Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone)

fight the mean black fella with the

Indian headset?”

_ "Enter villian Clubber Lang, a hulk-
ing, stereotyped black ﬁghter who
spews out i_nsults, like‘ an angry
camel spraying saliva.When the fight
between the two quickly follows, it
becomes obvious that Balboa will
lose—it’s simply too early in the
show forthings to go right.

Meanwhile, Mickey (played ever
so brilliantly by Burgess Meredith)
lies dying back in the dressing room.
His ensuing death evokes little emo-
tion, one example of how “Rocky
II_I” rings hollow.

lvﬂckey is - archetypical: crusty,
caustic, with gleaming eyes that
show a leprechaun surely lies within.
Who can forget the scene from the
first “Rocky” where the weeping
Mickey crept out of Balboa’s smelly
tenement, told by Rocky he wasn’t
needed. Such scenes, for all their,
innocence, lent the original,’ a
perceptive stance that “Rocky III”

A fails to equal.

‘authenticity?

The Count '

The re-entry ot Apollo Creed
(Carl Weathers) brieﬂy lends
oomph! to the picture, but when the
ex-champ and enemy now becomes
a friend and trainer, sigh, you lose
interest. The traditional climax to
Bill Conti’s swelling theme song left
me wrinkling my brow in disbelief as

‘ Rocky and Creed frolicked in the

surf of the Pacific. Where had our
friend, the palooka from Philly,
gone?

Other characters are seemingly
missing in action. Burt- Young's
Polly is given little room, merely
dawdling behind “the Rock” and
wisecracking the new trainer,
Creed. Talia Shire’s mousy Adrian
also dawdles along to the gym, and
to the pool and to the beach and
then, frustrated by the script, she
explodes completely out of charac-
ter to lend Rocky some harsh words
of encouragement.

The second half of the movie
takes on an eerie, almost
documentary-like feel. One has to
think just how autobiographical the
story has become. Balboa became
spoiled and civilized——he lost his
edge, or, as the movie puts it—“the
eye of the tiger.” Did the same thing
happen to Stallone? Has he created
a creature gone out of control?
Have we___,so personalized the story
that to allow Stallone any other iden-
tity would be to destroy our roles?

The second Balboa-lgang fight
ensues and although the action is
slicker and faster paced than ever,
the choreography is an insult to
even the most novice ﬁght fans. The
production notes boast that an
amazing 130 blows were “thrown” in
the final round, but does it ever
cross the producers’ minds that
rarely, if ever, do two ﬁghters take
turns pummeling each other with
wild swinging blows?

Boxing is a sport of defense as
much as offense, and the use of the
jab and the counter-punch is funda-
mental. In these times of multi-
million-dollar movie-making, can we
the public ask for a bit of

’ T.E.

 

Q‘.

IIIIIIIUUUUIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlllllllllllllsl

Poltergeist 

Better Haunts &-Gardens

There is, something unscary
about “Poltergeist”——an awkward
charm and serenity to the movie
itself that clashes with the story at
hand. . s‘

The major characters (Jobeth
Williams and Craig T. Nelson as
Mom and Pop) are wonderfully
funny and likeable and the movie is
directed in such an airy, warm-
hearted manner by Tobe Hooper
(and rumor has it, by Steven Spiel-
berg, who also wrote the screenplay
and produced it) that the ghost
story gets lost somewhere in the
middle.

I suspect Hooper and Spielberg
wanted this likability to contrast and
intensify’ the terror but it backﬁred.
“Poltergeist” is just too nice for its
own good.

Tract-land suburbia, where para-
dise is only a jacuzzi away, is the
setting for this utterly modern ghost
story. Funny things begin to happen
in Mom and Pop’s beautiful house—.—
the furniture moves, the silverware
bends into funny shapes and the
youngest daughter stares at the TV,
and ominously states, “They're
here!”

Exactly who's “here” remains a
spooky mystery that ruins the fami-
ly’s nice lifestyle. The ghosts steal
the little girl, and Mom and Pop have
to save her before she falls into the
white- light (don't ask what this is all
about; you have to take it on faith).

Things do get spooky, however,
and occasionally your ﬂesh jumps,
but the likability of Mom and Pop

and suburbia are much more
appealingly set forth than the scary
stuff is. Some of the horror scenes
are so ﬂimsy it’s laughable.

Considering Spielberg’s wonder- I

ful “E.T. ,” one of the most surprising
aspects of “Poltergeist” is the lack-
luster portrayals of the children.

We don't care much about them
because they’re such show-biz-type
kids, and since the movie depends
on our emotional attachment to
them, they leave a very empty feel-
ing at the heart of the movie.

Still, “Poltergeist” is a very pleas-
ant movie to watch. The details are

' superb, as are the staging and the

slow, subtle, but effective, pacing.

It's’ the story though that falls
apart, and without a story, “Polter-
geist” just isn't much of a movie.

‘Jobeth Williams and Craig T. Nel-
son are wonderful as Mom and Pop;
too bad they have to pour their guts
out over such silly stuff. Too bad
everybody involved has to pour his
guts out over such silly stilff.

If you're a sucker for ghost
stories—if anything unexpected
absolutely terrifies you-——then “Pol-
tergeist” will probably knock your
socks off.

I couldn't help but think that “Pol-
tergeist” was a ghost story despite
itself, and that deep down inside it
wants to be a nice, warmhearted
romantic comedy about suburbia.

J.H.

Une Belle Diva

Even if you pronounce Wagner
with a “W” and think Puccini is Ital-
ian dog food, you'll enjoy “Diva,” a
sparkling French gem combining-
mystery, romance and intrigue
against the setting of contemporary
Paris.» '

The plot concerns Jules, a young
postman and music lover who tapes
a recital by a renowned American
opera singer and steals her recital
gown. What makes this tape special
is the fact that the diva has consist-
ently refused to make recordings, in
order to maintain her artistic
integrity.

The next day while on his rounds,
Jules witnesses the abduction and
stabbing of a young woman’ at a train
station. Unknown to Jules, the
woman, former mistress of a crime
syndicate kingpin, has dropped a
cassette containing a full confession
into Jules’ mailbag.

So now Jules is pursued. Two of "

the most odious thugs in recent
ﬁlms, a Spanish pimp with slicked
back hair and a baby faced punkoid
with wrap-around shades and an ice
pick are after the cassette and Jules’
permanent silence.

Two Taiwanese record company
agents, inscrutable in their mirrored
Foster Grants are after the recital
tape, which could be worth millions.

The police are also after the
cassette, but Jules thinks it’s

because of the gown and consis-
tently evades them.

Add to this a growing love story
between the star-struck Jules and
the lonely diva and the stage is set

for mass contusion. .

Comparisons to Hitchcock are
unavoidable. The manner in which
the innocent bystander is pulled into
circumstances beyond his control
and the resulting tension both pay
homage to ..the master. ‘

Although purists may be peeved
by the character of Jules, who,
(unlike Cary Grant in “North by
Northwest”) seems to become most
helpless with increasing pressure,
this is the result of deeper character
development, usually an area of
secondary importance in “Hitch-
cock’s films.

_This development adds an extra
texture to the ﬁlm by subtly compar-
ing three relationships, one male
dominant, one female dominant and
one that appears -to be roughly
equal.

The quiet moments of these rela- -

tionships contrast well with the
tense action which is ostensibly

«occurring at the same time. .
“Diva” manages the impossible-

the nearly ﬂawless development of
at least three related subplots—and
slick direction ties them together
superbly.

In fact, “Diva” seems to be struc-
tured much like an opera, which lay-
ers of subplots and themes are
introduced, strengthened and finally
resolved in unity. The settings in
“Diva” are impeccable, the photo-
graphy is excellent, and the acting is
natural and believable.

In fact, everything in “Diva”
works. ‘I'M.

Three Brothers:
Three Italys

“Three Brothers,” an Italian sub-
titled film playing at the Arcade
Theater, isn’t really about a family.
The men in the film are too different
in their temperaments, political
beliefs and lifestyles to be believable
as brothers. What the film really
gives us is an all-too-believable pic-
ture of a divided Italy.

In the film, three brothers are
called back to the southern country-
side by their father for their moth-
er’s funeral.) Raffaele (Philippe
Noiret), the‘ oldest, is a judge in
Rome whose life is threatened by
terrorists for his involvement in a
trial. Accepting the case amounts to
suicide, but Raffaele believes that he
and others must deal with terrorism,
or Italy will come crashing down.
Rocco (Vittorio Mezzogiorno), the

_ middle -brother, is a social worker

ﬁghting a losing battle in the Naples
slums. Michele Placido plays Nicola,
the youngest, a hotheaded auto
worker from Turin in trouble for his
union activities. He also brings to
the funeral his daughter (Marta Zaf-
foli), whose Northern mother he is
currently divorcing. .

While at home, all three brothers
visit old friends, but discover that
both they and the friends have
changed. Nicola’s old girlfriend is
married. Raffaele’s wetnurse is a
wrinkled old crone, and her olive
tree, which he used to climb, now
barely reaches above him.

The brothers also spend an
almost sleepless, cramped night in
their childhood beds. The oldest
and the youngest become foils for
each other as Raffaele links -to ter-
rorism Nicola’s belief that violence is
sometimes necessary to achieve
change. Nicola charges that his
brother and people like him, who
support the status quo, make "ter-
rorism inevitable.

One of the film’s problems is the
too-neat opposition of beliefs among

the brothers. Nicola and Raffaele’s
discussions tend to sound like politi-

cal set pieces rather than dialogue. '

Even the film’s locations—Rome,
Naples, Turin and the southern
countryside—are chosen to remind

the audience of the bitter dispute,

between the rich industrial North
and the poor agricultural South
The brothers are symbolic charac-
ters, created to telescope the prob-
lems of Italy’s present into a
manageable form for a ﬁlm. And
they do this.

Director Francesco Rosi does
better with his treatment of Italy’s
past and future——the boys’ father
and his granddaughter. The father,
Donato, is played by 80ish French
actor Charles Vanel in a perfor-
mance that is one of the best to be
seen this or any year, _

While his sons comfort him on
their arrival, it is his granddaughter
who is his comfort. The two are able

to communicate across their gap of ‘

years and experience better than
the three brothers can. When the
city child asks Donato why he

doesn’t need clocks, he explains to

her that stars and animals guide a
farmer’s life. Old people, he says,
rise at the rooster’s second crow
while children get up at the donkey’s
first bray. While his sons grope with
bewildering change, Donato has

been able to build a happy life on,

such constants.

Rosi doesn’t give his film a Holly-
wood ending. Mama is buried, and
Donato is left alone. The three
brothers must go back to face-not
necessarily to solve—their prob-
lems. However, while the older men
find they cannot go home again,
Rosi shows that their children can
visit the past and learn from expe-
riences their fathers have tossed
away in their eagerness to grow up.

And Now For Something
Very Much The Same

If you are a Monty Python fan
-(and there is no middle ground-
you either love them or you hate
them), you’ll probably like “Monty
Python Live At The Hollywood
Bowl” very much. .

If_I sound a little less than exuber-
ant, it’s not because I detest“Monty
Python; on the contrary, I count
myself as one of their biggest fans,
and that’s exactly where the prob-
lem lies.

To enjoy “Monty Python Live At
The Hollywood Bowl” you have to
be a top notch fan, but if you are one
you've probably seen all the skits

' before.

Though there’re funny skits like_
“I’m A Lumberjack” and “Albatross
Something or Other,” they do tend
to get a little tiresome, especially
when you pay $4 (unless you go on
bargain clay, which might be a wise
thing to do considering the cost of
living these days) for something you
saw for free on Channel 13. .

So you might get a little upset
even though you’re laughing a l9t_,_

ﬁﬁfiyou TrTght get a Tittle-‘ahr-toyed

with the boring filler material mat
occasionally springs up between
skits.

But this is Monty Python. This is
Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Jones,
Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam
and my personal fave——Michael

Palin all together, acting approp- .

riately strange and “bizarre.

I don't know why I laughat Monty
Python. I just do.

I have only two questions for the
troupe (they probably don't read
The Pitt News, but maybe they
know somebody who does, so if
you’re that somebody, tell them).

One is, why didn’t you include the
dead parrot sketch? Now there's a

‘ classic! Like “Who’s on first?”.

The other is, why didn’t you dress
up like women and do the Jean-Paul
Sartre sketch? That is my all—time
favorite sketch in the world!

Even so, “Monty Python Live At
The Hollywood Bowl” is a funny
movie, though it is strictly for the
very devoted or fanatic amongst us.

speaker is Harrison Ford. The,
audience response is a ﬂurry of soft
chuckles.

The problem with “Blade
Runner” is one that often mars
movies that aspire to the film noir

_ tradition. So much effort has gone

into creating that charged, forebod-
ing atmosphere, little seems to have
been left over forminor considera-
tions such as plot and character
development.

Based on a science fiction novel
by Philip K. Dick called “Do
Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep?”, the story goes like this:
The powerful Tyrell Corporation
has advanced the techniques of
genetic engineering to the point
where it is possible to create “repli-
cants,” ﬂesh and blood humanoids
that are stronger, quicker and smar-
ter th_a_r_i humans.

"The andrbids can be pro-
grammed to perform those distaste-
ful tasks humans take for granted
-nuclear core loading, political
homicide. After a replicant uprising,
they are outlawed on Earth and per-

itted only on the “off-world” colo-

nies. To enforce this policy, “Blade
Runner” squads were created to
track down and “retire” replicants
on Earth. Nevertheless, six of these
test‘-tube felons have made a bloody
escape to Earth in search of
increased longevity. Enter Deckard,
played by Ford, a sort of futuristic
Harry 0, who is assigned tdlocate
and dispatch the six with his over-
sized handgun and corny narration.

Along the way, a view of the

future is presented which is far,

removed from the sterile, white-on-
white, controlled technocracy of
such films as “THX 1138” and “Rol-
lerball.” Instead, the future shock of
director Ridley Scott (“Alien”) is one
which is crawling with life, filled with
color, sound and movement, and
about as controlled as Times
Square on New Year's Eve.

Twenty-first century L.A. is dark,
rainy and seedy. Everywhere are

neon lights, advertisements moving ,

on the sides of buildings stories high
and huge blimps hyping the advant
tages of going “off-world.”

As_in most films of this genre,
there are distinctive characters. The
replicants are portrayed as sinister
yet pitiable; the police are hard-
boiled and street-smart. There’s
even an out-of-work genetic engi-
neer, a strange little fellow who liter-
ally “makes” friends.

Unfortunately, the elements just
don’t come together, and the result
is a good film that should have been
great. We never get more than a
surface view of the principals, and
much of the action plods along. If
you go expecting another “Raiders
of the Lost Ark,” you’ll be disap-
pointed; but in all fairness, “Blade
Runner” shouldn't be criticized
because it doesn’t heap thrill upon
thrill. There are several fine, low-key
performances.

' In addition to Ford, Sean Young is
very good as the replicant that
Deckard begins to fall in love with,
and Rutger Hauer is particularly
effective as the leader ‘of the rebel
replicants. But what really makes
this film worth seeing is the setting.
The special effects that have gone
into creating 21st century L.A. are
simply fabulous. “Chinatown” was
never like this.

Are They Just A String Of Coincidences?

J

Page 

 

Casimir Mysiinski took an
early retirement from his
post as athletic director,
prompting a widespread
feeling that he was pushed
out of his job. Unlike Bozik,
the man chosen as his re-
placement, Mysiinski was
not considered a managerial
type. He was good at de-
lagatlng power to others, but
he was not a take charge
person. In his own quiet
way, Mysiinski was respons-
ible tor Pitt’s renaissance in
athletics; He helped to build
a national football power.
And he was guiding the
basketball program in the
same direction. He left the
legacy that Bozik now will
inherit.

 

 

Assistant Chancellor Ed
Bozik, who was recently
named Pitt’s athletic direc-
tor, will leave chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar’s office

on September 1, and will

pack his bags for the Pitt
Field House. He brings with
him an impressive back-
ground in management and
leadership. Posvar said he
is charging Bozik with bring-
lng non-varsity sports up to
the level of the varsity, with
improving alumni support
and with keeping an eye on
the best Interests of the
student-athletes who will be
placed in careers. Bozik
said that athletics are big
business and he intends to
treat it as such.

The entire scene was Gothic.
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar,
seated at the long conference table
that runs across his medieval
Cathedral office, recently named
assistant chancellor Ed Bozik as the
man to succeed Casimir Myslinski
as Pitt’s new athletic director.

If the medieval setting had not
been enough to suggest something
unseen, the string of coincidences
certainly was.

The question at issue is whether»

Mysiinski, who rather suddenly
had announced that he was taking
an early retirement last April, was
pushed out in favor of someone
younger who could play a more
visible role in Pitt athletics.

By choosing Bozik, Pitt officials
did nothing to dispell that nagging
suspicion, and the series of events
leading up to the press conference
in which Bozik was officially made

the new athletic director only
heightened the tension.

0 Though Myslinski was noted
for his ability to delegate power
within the athletic department, he
was not considered a strong
managerial type in the sense of
athletics as big business. He was
exceptional at giving orders, but he
was not an accounting whiz who
could keep the books well-
balanced.

Bozik, on the other hand, is a

A proven leader and management

person. He holds a doctorate in
political science from Georgetown
University. He served in the Air
Force from 1953 to 1966 as an oper-
ationsal aircrew member and as 3,.

comptroller and management"

analysis officer.

In 1966 he became an Air Force
Academy instructor and in 1971, he
served as chairman of the acade-
my’s political science department.
Power? He always has been a
leader.

0 Bozik, who was Posvar’s right-
hand man, was selected over 26

. applicants set aside by a screening

committee. He had not applied for
the position.

“I decided to accept the job last A

night," Bozik said at the
conference. ,

Was Posvar waiting for Bozik?
Did Bozik call Posvar in the morn-
ing and say, ‘‘I’ll take thejob"? Did
Posvar say, “It’s yours? ”

0 There was also thequestion of
timing. Pitt officials notified press
members of the conference at noon
on Thursday, June 24, same time
that Judge Joseph Del Sole was
telling a gathering of reporters at
Three Rivers Stadium that the city
of Pittsburgh would provide relief
for the Pirates. Many media
members were out of the way at the
stadium while Bozik was being
named the new athletic director.

‘O Bozik was taken directly from
Posvar’s‘office and he has imme-
diately adopted the attitude that
there must be a better mix between
athletics and academics.

“This university will not recruit
a young man, or woman, who does
not have a realistic chance of gra-
duating. This is no different from
the past, but it’s a principle that I
intend to abide by," he said.

Does this statement imply that
Mysiinski did not follow the prin-
ciple? And if so. did Pitt officials
compensate by removing Bozik’s
luggage from the chancellor’s
office?

Perhaps. But then again. maybe
onlyithesetting was I.“-.r“~3>*'ri « - -

Pirates Shrug Their Shoulders Atskepticsf

By SCOTT DELLETT

About one month ago, area
sports writers were giving the Pitts-
burgh Pirates a not-so-royal fune-
ral. The cause of death, according
to the doctors of baseball, was a
lack of pitching, a shortstop hit-
ting below .200 and a bench that
looked like a refrigerator does on
the day before payday.

The (few loyal fans were asking
themselves what could be done to
improve the club. Look to the farm
system for prospects? The once-
rich farm system was drained of tal-
ent in trades by General Manager
Harding Peterson. Trades? Judg-
ing from Peterson’s recent record,
the Pirates would have been‘ the
Minnesota Twins of the National
League within two months. Stand
 Well, if everyone could be sat-
isfied with last place...

The Pirates’ ship was sinking.
Chuck Tanner was burning. The
Wln-_lOSS record was worsening.

Even the Chicago Cubs, the defini-
tion of a loser, were pulling away
from the Bucs.

So what happens? The Pirates
pull off a 17-9 record for the month
of June, finally receiving some
good starting pitching along with
the already potent hitting attack
and an almost flawless bullpen.
They even walked over the Mon-
treal Exp0s—considered to be the
best team in the National League
East—seven times out of nine
within the past two weeks.

Did Tanner hire a voodoo doctor
to cast spells on the Pirates’ oppo-
nents? Did John Candelaria and
Don Robinson replace their ailing
arms with bionic parts? Did Dale
Berra find a bat that attracts base-
balls like metal is attracted to a
magnet?

The Pirates’ recent success comes
from a combination of things.
First, and perhaps most significant
the starting pitching has finally
become consistent after spending
most of April and May being

despite his poor performance on
Sunday gives the Bucs three solid
starters to keep the games close.

If newcomer Larry Mcwilliams
and Manny Sarmiento can consis-
tently give six good innings, the
once-weak starting rotation could
be a strong force in the Eastern Di-
vision.

Of course, the bullpen remains
strong. Few can match the righty-
lefty combination of Kent Tekulve
and Rod Scurry. The lanky
Tekulve, generally overlooked as
being one of the best in baseball in
light of Bruce Sutter and Neil
Allen, is having one of the better
years of his career. Scurry, who had
early problems in controlling his
curve ball, has complemented
Tekulve.

The miracle of the month could
be the resurrection of shortstop

Dale Berra’s bat. Berra, who was
struggling to hit .190, has raised his
batting average nearly sixty points.
The much-criticized Berry is now
hitting .258, which is what a man-
ager expects a shortstop to hit. Ber-
ra’s fielding has also improved.
Although he sommetimes boots
the simple plays, he is playing
well, considering that his natural
position is third base.

Although several players have
had slight slumps, the batting
remains the strongest point of the
team. League leading hitter Tony
Pena, along with Jason Thomp-
son, Johnny Ray and Bill Madlock
are batting above .300, while Mike
Easler is returning to his hard-
hitting style. A

Even Peterson’s trade magic has
returned. After shipping Bill
Robinson to Philadelphia for
Wayne Nordhagen, it was discov-
ered that Nordhagen has a back
injury. Shades of Steeler tlop Paul

originally had Nordhagen before
trading him to the Phillies for Dick
Davis, were willing to give up a
player to replace Nordhagen. They
chose to send Davis to the Pirates,
which the Phillies didn't want to
have happen as the Pirates are their
chief competition and Nordhagen
returned to the Blue Jays.

Other adroit deals made by
Peterson include the acquisition of
Jim Morrison from the White Sox
and McWilliams from the Atlanta
Braves. Judging‘ from their perfor-
mances so far, both will contribute

to the Pirates’ pennant drive. .,"".—

Despite all.of the good things‘
that have happened this month,
there are still problems. For exam-
ple, centerfielder Omar Moreno is
in a terrible slump. Moreno’s aver-
age has dropped about 30 points to
a .245. Such an average is not good
from a leadoff hitter, and in order
for the Pirates to maintain their
winning ways, Moreno must reach
base more often.

It is also important for Dave
Parker to recover from his wrist
injury and start producing some
power. With a healthy Parker in
the lineup, both physically and
emotionally, the Pirates are a mMuch
better team.

No one knows if the Pirates can “
continue to play this type of base-
ball. But if they do, by the time
August and September roll along,
they will be right in the pennant
race, which is a thought that many
people would have laughed at a
month ago.

Europe. I guess they figure every-

But they tripped up this year—they
actually released some good stuff!
The following aren’t the only
albums worth buying for the
summer doldrums, but they’re a
SL311.

LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

JAPAN
 “pan

Epic

It seems as if the one thing for
which all of us in the popular
music playground are always wait-
ing for is that elusive quality char-
acterized as “something new.”

But that’s really something we’ll
never get—it doesn’t exist.

' The way I see it, everything fol-
lowing the development of the base
of rock—the invention of the elec--
tric guitar and its melding Wllhl
drums, bass and keyboards——_has

/been expansion, not invention.

There are those who would

_, argue that the synthesized, electro
music of the past few years is new,

«r’“j._‘it isn’t; the synthesizer is just
"recreating sounds we've heard
before.

The only thing that can be
thought of as “new” is an altera-
tion of that base or a combination
with another arm of music. So
while it’s still not something com-
pletely different,,it sounds differ-
ent, and if we’re lucky, even good.

Which brings me to Japan.
Japan doesp’t sound like a typical
band, although it uses the same
instru_ments as most (guitars, key-
boards, bass, drums and synthesiz-
ers). Instead, it has taken funk, jazz,
basic rock and disco and mixed
them all up carefully ‘to create a
form of rock that is both different
and good.

 say it sounds a bit like Roxy

Music isn’t a putdown, as it could
be if Japan were merely imitating
them. ‘

But Japan takes up where Roxy

Music left off, taking it all at least .

two steps further.

Lead singer and songwriter
David Sylvain is deserving of most
of-the credit, because without his
poetic landscapes and gentle, de--
tached vocals, there would cer-
tainly be no Japan. His skills are
nothing short of amazing-—each

‘A and every song on this U.S. debut
(they’ve released five albums in
Europe and the United Kingdom)
is brimming with rare instrumen-
tal, uality and ingenuity.
éﬁ, it’s not something new, but
it s a mind-blowing expansion.

COMBAT ROCK

The Clash

Epics I

Having been partially dethroned
as the premiere purveyors of the

_punk/ reggae/ rock soiind and‘sel-

ling out their place as the mouth-
piece of angry British youth, the
Clash is wide open for attack..

Whether it’s’ posing to get pic-.

tures taken for the umpteenth time
in any publication that will have
them, hanging around" Hollywood
types like Martin Scorcese or just
mumbling inane lines about what
life is really all about in “Rude
Boy,” the Clash seems to get
slammed for it every time they turn
around.

Rather than feel that they’ve
been dealt an unjust hand by a
fickle audience who likes to love
and loves to hate, it seems only fair
to regard them as out-of-touch stars
who deserve the backlash.

Joe Strummer’s recent “disap-
pearance” (the Clash camp issued a
public appeal for Joe to return,
which, of course, he did imme-
diately before the start of their
latest tour) smelled more like a rot-
ten publicity scam than the real
thing, and that’s just one example
of how the band tries to manipu-
late its followers (or anybody
who’ll listen, for that matter).

In light of what they've become,
the Clash’s “Combat Rock” can’t
be taken seriously,fas is always

intended by this group.

Here they are once again singing
about hatred for a bureaucracy
that’s made them rich, free men
who live immeasurably better than
those about whom they still write.

As usual, the music’s good stuff.
leading me to think that there’s
still a sizeable chunk of hope left
for those of us who hope the group
will redeem itself. If they gave up
that die-hard punkist attitude and
eased up on the image a bit, they’d
be back where they used to be in my
book.

If the Clash feels it’s necessary to
construct socio-poli-economic
themes for the songs, then let’s
hope they take a cue from the jam:
whisper the meanings into the lis-
teners’ ears instead of bashing them
over the head with it.

Joan Jtt and the Blackhearts will be appearing July 31 i
at the Stanley Theatre downtown.

THE LAST OF THE
MOHICANS

Bow Wow Wow

RCA

Opening for The Police at the
Civic Arena a while back, Bow
Wow Wow was met by a less than
warm reception from a bunch of
(mostly) barely pubescent pseudo-
New Wavers who had come only to
hear their coverboy idols sing
songs heard on the radio five times
an hour.

It was the same old story: the
opening band is fairly new, with
no big hits and little airplay under
their belts,‘ so middle-class Ameri-
can kids ignore them.

Now, I know what you’re
thinking—that I’ve told you
before, several times, that BWW is a
good, fun band. And, because of
your conduct during their set at the
Arena, I’m gonna tell you again!

Just because they look funny and
don’t play like Loverboy doesn’t
mean you won’t like them. If you
honestly listened to their debut LP,
“See Jungle! See Jungle!” and
didn’t like them, well, at least you
gave them a chance.

For those of you who have yet to
discover BWW, their latest offering
is just the thing to acquaint you.
“Last of the Mohicans” includes
two great new songs and two great
old songs.

“I Want Candy,” their most
recent single, is a dancer’s delight,
in addition to being a great remake.

“Give Me A Cowboy,” another
new number that opened their set
at April’s concert, is also a foot-
stomper, complete with a sugges-
tive choruszi “Give me a

Bow Wow Wow sings the New Wave hit, “I Want 

on their new L.P., “The Last of the Mohicans.”

cow.../Give me a boy.../Gimme a
coow-booy!”

The other cuts, “Louis Qua-
torze” and “Mile High Club,” are
remixed versions of two of the bet-
ter tracks from BWW’s import-
only cassette, “Your Cassette Pet.”

“Louis Quatorze” is especially
demonstrative of BWW’s style and
image; it’s about a 14-year-old sex

‘fiend who fantasy-rapes his girl-

friend: “Oh, I love it when he says
so seriously/With his gun in my
back/ ‘Honey, close your eyes and
think of England!’ ”

Of course, many have found this
song offensive-—as they were meant
to. But then, BWW isn't for the
delicate, but rather for those not
afraid to be shaken up a bit and
have a great deal of fun in the
process. A‘

Bonnie Hayes and The Wild
Combo.

A San Francisco-based group
known as The Punts until a few
weeks ago, Bonnie Hays and The
Wild Combo have made their
debut with an album that’s well
worth the asking price.

They're similar to The Wai-
tresses with the throwback to the
'60s girl-group style, but I liked
“Good Clean Fun” much more
than “Wasn't Tomorrow
Wonderful?”

What we’ve got here is pure,
punchy pop with—surprise!—no
synthesizers.

“Good Clean Fun” might be a
bit difficult to find since it’s not on
a major label, but don’t let that
stop you from getting a copy.

The Slash label (X, The Blasters)

_isn’t known for duds, and this is no
exception. Bonnie Hayes and The
Wild Combo aren’t ready to knock
the other girls off the top, but the
insinuation of such a coup runs
deep. ‘

THE GIFT
The Jam
Polydor

“The Gift.’-’ is the ]am’s sixth
album and, like its predecessors, is
a slice out of the musical genius
pie. From “In the City” “to “All
Mod Cons” and their last album,
“Side Effects,” the Jam just seems

_to keep stretching and bending

their own form of mod-rock effort-
lessly with no end in sight.

What makes the band such mas-‘
tercraftsmen is not easy to pin-
point, but the key to their success is
Paul Weller, singer, songwriter
and critics’ choice for Most Impor-
tant Person in Rock n’ Roll Today.
His forteis devising songs with a
strong backbone of meaning and
pairing them up with can’t-forget-
‘em hooks.

A good number of its cuts are
definitely chart-topping ma¢eria1_
“A, Town Called Malice"/“Pre-
cious" has already hit No. l on the
British charts, and the Latin-
Calypso beat of -"The Planner"s

Dream Goes Wrong” or the crash-
ing dance rhythm of “Trans-
Global Express”_ probably aren’t
far behind.

The Jam is one of the most eclec-
tic groups of our era. Along with
the Sex Pistols and the Clash, they
were the best of the mid-'70s origi-
nals. But the Pistols are gone
forever, and the Clash seems to
have disappointed us in‘ many
ways; yet the Jam still has their
heads on straight.

Integrity is uncommon for the -
. majority of artists in the long run,

but “The Gift" proves that the Jam
has it—in abundance.

PELICAN WEST
Haircut 100
Arista .

For the life of me, I‘can't 
out why these guys are such a rage '
in—where else—jolly old England.
The music is pleasant enough-

‘ lots of island-type pop, veryglide-y

and slick—but why “Pelican
West” was No. I for a couple of
weeks is still incomprehensible.
The only thing I am figure out is
that all the English schoolgirls
were growing tired of male music
stars who wore more make-up than
they did (let’s face it, Marc
Almond’s eyeliner is more than a
bit garish; he looks like some mad

, female impersonator).

Haircut 100 are cute, clean-cut
boys—-a preppier group of Richie '
Cunninghams, if you will. If you
need some music for that polo
party you’re throwing at daddy’s
club, then by all means buy this.

THE FUN BOY THREE
Fun Boy Three-
Chrysalis

This entire record has a'chant-
like quality to it. The songs havea
way of drilling themselves in
through an understated rhythm of
which you won’t even be aware.

Fun Boy Three is reminiscent of
the Talking Heads in this way,
without that band's intellectual,

art-‘school trappings. These have ,A

been replaced by a lighter, let‘s-be-
fun attitude.

Even the heaviest song on the
album, “The Lunatics Have
Taken Over The Asylum," about

the political irony of England’s‘ V

government, doesn't sound so des-
pairing or angry as it sounds entic-
ing and hypnotically humorous.
A big to-do has been made about
Bananarama, an all-girl trio that
sings back-up on several tracks and
shares equal credit with Fun Boy

. Three for the smash hit (overseas,

of course), “It Ain't What You Do
(It's The Way You Do It)."

The girls do add that bit of ling!
that helps make this LP so good,
but I wonder if, perhaps, any three.
girls capable of singing" in key
would have done just as well.

Anyway, to answer that all-
important question, "What do you
get when you take three Specials

boys and put them in their own r

group with an occasional appear-
ance by
girls?," the answer is a terrificgnew
band and an even better debut
album. i
Let the fun begin...
