Senate votes for dual health plan

J. Dennis O'Connor looks on.

By Scott Emmert
For The Pitt News

The University Senate yester-
day overwhelmingly voted in
favor of the Beneﬁts and Welfare
Committee’s recommendation
that Pitt maintain both
HealthAmerica and Blue Cross
as its active health insurance car-
riers. .

Benefits and Welfare
Committee Chair Herb Chesler
presented that body’s recommen-
dation that Pitt make no change
in the status quo with respect to
medical insurance options, and

advised Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor against freezing
Healtl1America’s insurance pro-
gram.

Senior Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance Dr. Ben
Tuchi voted against the recom-
mendation, expressing doubt that
granting Blue Cross sole
provider status would constitute
a monopoly.

“A monopoly condition exists
where the buyer has no options,”
Tuchi said. “In our case, the buy-
ers have a signiﬁcant number of
options.” -

Tuchi instead referred to mak-

ing Blue Cross the university’s
only insurance carrier as “a sole
source agreement.” He added
that Pitt aheady engages in over
13,000 sole source business
agreements. p

Tuchi went on to unofficially
suggest that in order to maintain
the choice available with keeping
both carriers, that staff and facul-
ty pay extra to affect the univer-
sity savings ($l.5—2 million a
year) that would be realized with
Blue Cross sole providership. “It
is not a sin to execute one’s ﬁdu-
ciary responsibility,” he said.

Grevnik receives professional award

By Alexa Seretti
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center is renowned worldwide for its innova-
tions in patient care.

Honors received by the medical staff span a
variety of fields, the exception being in the
field of critical care medicine — that is, until
this year. .

Dr. Ake Grenvik, a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh, was named
Distinguished Service Professor recently in
recognition of his contributions in treating ter-
minally ill patients.

The distinguished professorship is the first
of its kind in this field in the country.

Grenvik has served as the director of the
first and largest critical care training program
in the world and has prepared 400 people for

, leadership positions in his field. He is current-
ly serving as chair of the ethics panel at the
medical center.

“[Grenvik’s] leadership in training and
example in practice have saved many lives
and established the principles of the subspe-
ciality of critical care,” said Peter Winter,

chair of the department of anesthesiology.

Grenvik joked that his title would be more
appropriate reading “extinguished service pro-
fessor,” but he spoke with intensity when dis-
cussing his work.

Grenvik said he became interested in the
treatment of the terminally ill when writing a
post-faculty thesis in Sweden 27 years ago.
He became certified in anesthesiology and
took a position at the UPMC in the late 1960s
when transplants were simply a dream for the
future. “ ’

Grenvik said. he feels the biggest setback in
transplants operations is the ethical dilemmas
surrounding it. For instance, if the patient has
an ailing heart, her health will be deteriorating
rapidly. A doctor must then decide if it is
worth it to put this patient through the pain of
an operation.

“It is worth it to me to convert my dying
patient into a rose,” Grenvik said. _

There are even more questions raised on the

‘donor side when dealing with families of

brain-dead patients with healthy organs. A

law passed by former Gov. Robert Casey in

December gives the patient control over

The Student Government
Radio Talk Show kept WPTS
phone lines busy for practi-
cally the entire hour as stu-
dents came out of the wood-

. work to call in.

SGB members were
extremely pleased with the
results of the talk show, and
plans are underway for
another show in the very near
future.

“The phone rang off the
hook, discussion was great. It
was great to hear from the
students. It was just a really
beneficial experience,” stated
SGB member John Capriotti.

SGB President Julie
Crowell shared Capriotti’s
opinion regarding the talk
show. '

“It was very nice to see
that students actually are
concerned, and I’d like to
hear more from these stu-
dents,” Crowell added.

Students asked about a
variety of topics, ranging
from the lack of concerts on
Pitt’s campus to problems
with the food service system.

However, Crowell said the
main problem students
addressed was the problem
with safety on and off cam-
pus. ’

“Safety concerns were
lighting on campus, an escort
system and off-campus safe-
ty concerns,” Crowell stated.

Another problem discussed
involved the food services, in
particular questions regard-
ing meal plan changes for

next year and the closing of

the Tower C Cafeteria.

“The meal plan was a big
complaint. Not enough
healthy eating options.
Everything seems to be fast
food and fries,” said
Capriotti. - .

There was some questio
as to how the show would
turn out, since WPTS does
not regularly run talk shows,
plus the fact that calls would
not be screened before being
aired.

“I was very apprehensive
to have this show, being that
WPTS generally does not do
call in shows like this, plus
they don’t screen the calls

first,” said Crowell. “But I _

was happy to see students

The SGB is also continu-

SGB member Patrick Huey
recently submitted the pro-
posal to Public Safety and

planned sometime next

the proposal.

“We’re trying to put pres-

said Huey.

Huey said he was pleased
with the final proposal, as
were the other SGB mem-

Senate

0From page 1

Faculty Assembly last week
unanimously approved the rec-
ommendation of Benefits and
Welfare.

Chancellor O’Connor
abstained from yesterday’s Senate
Council vote.

Professor Glen Nelson, chair of
an ad hoc committee on post-
tenure review, issued a suggested
policy on annual post-tenure
review. Senate Council unani-
mously approved the policy
which closely resembles one
already existing in the faculty
handbook.

Some Pitt administrators and
Board of Trustees members were
calling for a new ﬁve-year review
policy. Nelson contends that an
effective policy already exists and
that it simply needs to be applied
more evenly throughout the uni-
versity. *

“What we have done is basical-
ly to suggest that the policy we
have in place as articulated in the
handbook with some minor mod-
iﬁcations ﬁts what we think is an
appropriate way to conduct arma-
al reviews at the University of
Pittsburgh,” Nelson said.

yesterday concerning the reafﬁr-
mation of university policy on
externally sponsored research.

The resolution seeks to affirm
that, “no agreement should pre-
clude the right of researchers to
publish the results of their
research,” and that “once signed
and submitted, the university
should not modify or change the
proposal without consultation
with investigators.”

The resolution then goes on to
ask administrative officers to
make efforts through the
American Association of
Universities, the various profes-
sional organizations and the polit-
ical system to support academic
freedom in this and all universi-
ties.

Faculty Assembly voted unani-
mously last week to support this
resolution, and Senate Council
did likewise yesterday.

Dr. Thomas Detre questioned
the need for reafﬁnnation, saying,
“I don’t agree with the resolution
because the resolution is already
university policy. Do we reaffirm
that we don’t steal from each
other?”

Detre suggested that Senate
Council engage in collegial con-
versation with administration
over issues, and that there was a
lack of appropriate contact.

gion, sex and national origin.” This soon led to affirmative
action. Three decades after the passage of this civil rights act,
the debate over what should be done to insure equality contin-
ues to be divisive. _

The Republican Congress has vowed to take apart the affir-
mative action programs, but they are not united on this and
face resistance from the other side of the aisle. Stanford
University political science professor Paul Sniderman was

quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette saying that people, ,

regardless of their political leanings, oppose racial prefer-
ences in hiring “simply because of what they think is fair or
not fair.”

Affirmative action does help give opportunities to people
who may not have been awarded a position simply on the
basis of their race, sex, religion, etc. Discrimination is unfor-
tunately a fact of life. As long as people continue to be differ-
ent, they will find reasons to dislike one another. Some of
these will be trivial and some may have basis in fact, but
ignorance and hatred must not be protected by the laws.

Whether affirmative action is good or bad is a case by case
issue, unfortunately. There are times when legitimate discrim-
ination can be proven. This, however, must not be allowed to
turn into an excuse to create insular, clannish institutions or
workplaces that claim to hire underrepresented minorities as
an excuse to practice discrimination themselves.

Instead, any affirmative action program should do its utmost
to stick to the spirit of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. There
should be no discrimination based on stereotypes which
encourage‘ deleterious images of ethnic groups in our society.

It must also guard against reverse discrimination. There are
positive stereotypes as well, and people who would rather
employ those of their own group rather than anyone else. The
practice of ethnic workforces must be avoided.

Allowing the most qualified person to do their job helps
everyone concerned. Allowing everyone a chance to get an

education helps the country as a whole. But reserving a cer-

tain number of seats in a medical school class, for example,
not only does adisservice to the society as a whole, but also
to- the the group it is trying to help. It spawns resentment
against that group and gives them a false sense of security,
need or perhaps privilege, all of‘ which lead to discrimination
in themselves. »

It is essential that people do notlose sight of the real prob-

lems in search of a scapegoat. Dismantling affirmative action .

will not make the economy better, except for those who know
somebody who can’t hire them now because of some affirma-
tive action program. Revitalizing the economy and educating

. people are the best affirmative action to be found.

Missing photos

I am writing to you con-
cerning the blank spaces in
the paper on Thursday,
Feb. 23. I did not see this

issue, but ifI had, and had

the censorship not occurred,
I might be writing this letter
anyway.

“Printer refuses photos.”
The front page article of the
March 2 editionstates that
one photo depicted people
engaging inoral sex. There
is a clear enough image in
this brief description for me
to know that I never want to
see these pictures. Please,
note that I don’t think that
sex is “dirty,” but I do think
it’s personal.

That staff writer states in
his article, “It’s a bad year to
be a risqué photo,” that he
has a responsibility to write
about issues that are “rele-

‘ vant and necessary” to the

student community. I do not
think that pictures of oral sex
fit into this category.

I realize that this may
appeal to many students at
our university, but please
remember the often silent
majority. Some people are
angry because our paper was
censored, but I am just dis-
appointed in those who
decided on the pictures in
the first place.

Flag burning

In regards to the recent
flag burning, I believe the
article in Wednesday’s paper
was written by the editor,
being that it was an unsigned
article. So, Christine, I do
not think the right to free
expression should include
flag burning.

You mentioned the flag
burning article appearing on

     

Letters to the editor

the same page in the Post
Gazette as other, more seri-
ous crimes. Maybe we
should stop and think that
maybe we as Americans

need to accept certain crimes _

in our society. But this crime
of burning an American ﬂag
should not be allowed to
progress to other crimes; the
punishment should result in
loss of citizenship and
deportation. No questions
asked. ’ ' ’ ‘

We are looking at a V“young,

man,” I believe still in his
teens. If he is not happy at
that age with his country,
think of the future crimes
Shawn could commit.‘ The
bombing of the World Trade
Center was an attack on the
United States — so is burn-
ing of the U.S. flag. We can
hope and pray that this inci-
dent does bring attention
back to this issue, and that

Hand-in-Hand

,To all of you who have
dedicated yourselves to this
year’s Hand-in-Hand
Festival, congratulations!!!
Whether you’re to be a one-
on-one volunteer, a facilita-
tor or senior staff member,

If you have an opinion, write a letter to the editor 50 words or less

and drop it off at 434 William Pitt Union.

you are truly wonderful.

For those of you who have
not volunteered your energy
as a contribution to making
kids smile on a day that most
don’t even compare to
Christmas: if you think I”m
trying to make you feel
guilty, you-’re totally correct.

This festival is for handi-
capped children who are of
the ages to enjoy an event
with _ games, prizes,
9“ _ _, and
friends. The volunteers guide
the children through this
event in Forbes Quadrangle,

where there are multitudes of

fun and 

To these kids, the festival
is much more than an amuse-
ment park in which they can
participate  It’s a day to
make new friends that they
would never otherwise have.
They know this, and that’s
why parents call the office
and thank those who have
contributed. The Hand-in-
Hand office desperately
needs at least 50 more volun-
teers. I know what many of
you are thinking: “It’s a bad

time right now because I’m .

extremely busy.”  But, I
promise you, if you become
a volunteer for the Hand-in-
Hand Festival, that dedicat-
ing one of your Saturdays of
the semester to a child who
is already thinking about you
and all the fun you’ll
both have will never feel so
good.

Just do it, you‘ll love it.
There’s no such thing as not
being experienced enough
unless, of course, you don’t
know how to make friends
and you don’t like to have
fun. Do it because you love
kids, do it because you want
to help Pitt help kids  Call

the Hand-in-Hand office at

648-1125.

Gamblers,
put money
on strong

conferences

(Here’s a
little inside
dope for all
the gambling
fanatics eager
to lose
money.)

    

  f recent
Columnist history is
Sean any indi-
Dllllcan cation of
\ how this

year’s NCAA tournament
will shape up, whoever
picked'UCLA to win it all is
in trouble.

 Out of all the talent-laden

UCLA teams dating back to
1980, the Bruins have pro-
duced absolutely nothing.
Maybe the UCLA athletic
director should bring back
John Wooden?

In fact, no Pac-10 squad
has won a national title in
the ‘80s and ‘90s. Teams
like Arizona and UCLA are
always ranked in the upper-
echelon going into the tour-
nament, but each year they
wilt under the pressure —-
it’s probably the heat.

Currently, Arizona State
and UCLA are still alive in
the Sweet 16, but anyone
who picked them to advance
to the Final Four could be in
trouble.

The fact of the matter is, a
team’s conference plays a
bigger role than people
think. Just look at the
Atlantic Coast Conference.
Since 1980, the ACC has
won five national champi-
onships, the most of any
conference. '

Along the same line, the
ACC has advanced four
teams to the Sweet 16 this
year — again, the most of
any league. Additionally, the
four teams alive are all seed-
ed in the top four of their
respective brackets.

Another powerful league is
the Southeast Conference.
With three teams surviving
the first two rounds, the SEC
is on the upswing. Last
year’s champion, Arkansas,
along with Kentucky and
Mississippi State make a
formibable trio. However,
the SEC hasn’t fared well in
the past. With the exception
of last year, the SEC had
never won a title through the
‘80s and ‘90s.

The Big East is still alive
with 'UConn and
Georgetown. A perennial
power in the early-to-mid
‘80s (two titles), the Big
East has been the Big Least
as of late- But with strong
recruiting in recent years, it
looks like it’s emerging as a

Panthers go
on to fourth
place finish

at ECAC's

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

As the men’s gymnastics
season began its slow tumble
to a close, it was the goal of
coach Frank D’Amico to

- have his team prepared for

two key championship meets
at the beginning of March.

The team responded by fin-
ishing first out of five com-
peting teams at the North
Atlantic Gymnastic
Championships, with their
highest score of the season, a
220.10. It was enough to
edge out perennial rival
William and Mary which
placed second, scoring
217.25.

“It was definitely our best
meet of the year,” said Brian
Narvaez. “It was a good feel-
ing to beat them [William
and Mary].”

James Madison finished
third with 213.25, followed
by Radford (199.5) and City
College of New York
(147.20).

The Panthers set season
highs in four of the six
events, including their neme-
sis — the pommel horse
(35.70).

“We had four solid scores
on horse which helped us
jump ahead,” Narvaez said.

Pitt sets season highs in North Atlantic win

On floor they tallied a
37.65, including Scott
Carslaw’s 9.6. That was fol-
lowed by a 37.55 on high
bar, which was led by Chris
Sweeten’s 9.6. And on paral-
lel bars it was Keith Youndt’s
9.5 helping Pitt post a score
of 36.9.

The key point of the meet

' was the team’s performance

on high bar.
“The high bar secured it
for us,” said Narvaez. ‘‘It was

Lacrosse finishes rough

week with loss to WVU

By Jerry Klayman
Staff Writer

Due to many mental mis-
takes and'a lack of depth, the
Pitt men’s lacrosse team suc-
cumbed to the Mountaineers
Virginia in
Morgantown on Saturday.

With the defeat, the team
concluded a very eventful
week in which they posted
two losses and one victory.

On Tuesday, the Panthers,

posted an impressive victory
against Washington and
Jefferson. The Panthers’
suffocating defense allowed

.just five goals as their

"high-powered offense found
the back of the net 18
times.

Thursday's opponent was
the Pitt Lacrosse Club,
which is comprised of gradu-
ates of Pitt. The team played
with a lot heart in the 13-10
loss. V
.“Thursday’s game was a
good one,” said head coach
Gary Neff. “I am proud of

the team for their efforts in
the game. We were forced to
play a zone defense because
of the sharp shooters that
they had. They played fine.
We just did not get the victo-
ry.”

The team is operating with
a roster of just 18 players.
The team’s usual number is
25 to 30.

“We have lost a lot of good
players to injuries,” said
Neff. “We are severely
undermanned right now. We
had a tough week, and I
think that the guys just ran
out of gas.”

“The team is looking for-
ward to the season,” said

.sop'h-omore Pat Shea. “We .
lost a lot of depth this sea-'

son. We really surprised our-
selves -with our performance
on Thursday. I think that we
are going to do fine with the
players that we have now.”

Next up for the Panthers‘

is a home game on Thursday
at the Cost Center at 7
p.m.

down to the wire for first
place, and we came
through.”

The following week Pitt’
did battle against eight of" the 1'

top teams in the East at the
ECAC Championships and

placed a modest fourth. The

Panthers posted their second-
highest score of the season, a
218.80. However, it was not
high enough to overcome
powerful host UMass
(223.45), William and Mary
