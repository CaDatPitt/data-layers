The Pitt News "

Tomorrow's meeting of the United
Faculty (UF) organization may represent a
critical moment of decision in the long and
rocky road toward the organization’s goal of
becoming the legally recognized bargaining

agent for a majority of Pitt professors in
contract talks with the university.

The UF membership must decide whether ' .

to continue to seek a consent election, which
can be arranged only if the university and the

;§culty organization agree to submit a joint

request for a faculty vote on the issue of
collective’ bargaining. Faculty attempts to
obtain the agreement of the administration
have failed so far.

According to United Faculty president
Philip Wion,about 85 percent of all Pitt stu-
dents are in schools or colleges within the
Provost’s Area, the legal bargaining unit
created by a 1976 ruling of the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board. United Faculty,
which is not an official university organiza-
tion but a labor union, has sought to become

“lithe bargaining agent specifically for the Pro-

vost's Area.

The Provost’s Area includes the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences, the Schools of Engi-
neering, Education, Social Work, and
Library and Information Sciences, the
Graduate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs, faculty librarians and faculty
at Pitt's four branch campuses. Four other
bargaining units, consisting of the faculty in
the fields of medicine, dentistry. law, and the

University of Pittsburgh — Pittsburgh, PA 15260

health-related professions, were also created
by the I976 ruling.

“What UF is trying to do is to bring about
an election by which the faculty in the Pro-
vost's Area can decide whether they want to
enter into a collective bargaining relation-
ship with the administration and the trustees
of the university,” Wion said.

“There's no doubt that the [U F] member-
ship and the majority of the faculty in the
Provost’s Area want to move toward an elec-
tion as quickly as possible,” Wion said. “We
would like to sit down with the chancellor
and other members of the administration
and trustees to see if it wouldn‘t be possible
to establish a cooperative approach to
allowing faculty to exercise their right to
vote on the question of collective

bargaining.”

Wion said he received a letter from Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar last Nov. 29 “in effect,
rejecting the idea ofthis election.” Wion said
he received a second letter last Friday signed
by David Sullivan, the university's attorney,
which “clarifies and confirms the fact that
the chancellor and the administration do not
a-"ree to a consent election.”

Another option the UF has is to file a
petition with the PLRB, thereby making a
unilateral request that the board set up an
election, according to Wion. This alternative
would probably create an “adversarial
rather than cooperative” atmosphere
between the professors and the administra-
tion, Wion said.

“It’s clear that that is the alternative. We
will be deciding very soon what our next step
will be,"‘he said, adding that tomorrow’s
meeting may or may not result in a decision.

“I think it’s still possible that the adminis-
tration and the trustees will agree to a con-
sent election. I‘m still very hopeful," UF

'vice—president James Cunningham said

yesterday.

“I hope we don’t have to [file a unilateral
request], but we're not going to wait
forever,” Cunningham explained. “If the
university doesn‘t consent by the end of this
month or possibly even sooner, we will prob-
ably file a request.“

In a dark, cavernous room in the
Cathedral of Learning, 50 to 60 stu-
dents atthe university were involved
in a heated and urgent discussion.

‘These students were devising a plan

black leaders. It was 1964. and acti-

nationwide. White students were
protesting the Vietnam war and de-
fying the draft while blacks were
tﬂghting for their human, civil and
political rights.

These black students at Pitt were
activists as well as concerned. They

classrooms and even fewer black
professors. The black students had

no organization to represent their '
overall views to the administrators, ‘

and there was no area within the
university that represented the study
of black political thought,culture or
history.

They decided to take a course of
action.

On Jan. l5, at approximately 9
p.m., 30 black students entered the
computer center office. the location
of the main data base that stored all
the vital information of the

t university.

After a seven-hour lock-in, the
students proposed their demands to
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar, who

had avoided the students forthe past
two years.

These students jeopardized their
future careers and even their lives in
order for more black students to
attend the university, for future
black students to have a black stu-
dies department, an organization
that would represent their needs and
an Afro-American section in the

‘ Hillman Library.

“We were radical back then, and
that course of actionvwas our major
militant move," said Curtiss Porter.
Porter was one of the students
involved in the lock-in, and he later
became a professor of black studies
at the university. .

The Black Action Society (BAS)
formed out of this protest has come
a long way since the radical days of

I969. Many of the students involved
in the BAS in the late 1960s and
early '70s have gone on to become a
part of corporate America.

One former member of the radi-
cals of 1969 is assistant to the dean of
FAS, Dr. Jack Daniel. Daniel has
observed the organization's progress
fromthen to now.

“l’ve heard and seen some good
things come out of thatoffice,“ said
Daniel. '

The BAS established itself as a
voice on campus. The organization's
Black Week has gained national
attention with the caliber of speak-
ers asked to attend. This year‘s cadre
of speakers ranged from the radical
Stokely Carmichael and Angela
Davis to the more conservative Ben-

NAACP.

The atmosphere at Pitt is more
receptive to black students now than
it was 15 years ago. The students’

billing. in whichas ma n_v as seven
bills will be delivered per month.
Students. however. will be billed
in the same manner as before.
and the changes may actually
result in a decrease in long-
distance rates.

“In terms of students. it [the
break-up] shouldn't mean much
more." according to Pitt admi-
Kathleen
Perr_v.. who is in charge of the
universit_v‘s Ceritrex operations.

“It's not going to affect any of
[the university's] billing proce-
dures as the_v are now." Bell Tele-
phone service representative
John Mitesser said. “It will prob-
abl_v happen in the future.”

The company is still in charge
of setting the rates for local and
suburban calls. and Mitesser said
there will probably be an
increase in the cost of measured

. local units. a fee assessed to stu-

:,,~.t.

dents for calls to suburban areas
such as Monroexille. Penn Hills
and McKeesport.

How much these suburban.

calls will cost depends on the dis-
tance of the call and how long it
lasts. but Mitesser said the

  

increase, of which the amount
has not yet been determined, will
probably take effect in the mid-
dle of January.

There has also been a pro-
posed increase of l5 cents for pay
phone calls, bringing the cost ofa
10-minute call up to 25 cents.

AT&T, which will handle
long-distance calls, may decrease
toll costs to keep in competition
with emerging phone companies
that offer lower rates.

Student Government Board
.members returned from a weekend
of seminars and lectures meant to
help them understand their duties as
student representatives.

Board members said thev feel co
fident and look forward to their
terms in office. _

“I feel the whole weekend was a
tremendous success,“ said board
member Pamela Hart. “I especially
liked the mock exercises concerning
the allocations process —— I will be

. much more comfortable with alloca-

tion decisions now."

“When I have a part in the alloca-
tions proccess,” Jim Haug, another
board member said, “I will know
exactly what to do. There is a solid

understanding of the boarding

duties:"

The retreat, which was held at the
Harley Hotel in Penn Hills, also
helped board members to’ learn
more about each other.

SGB President Ken Stram said he
felt the most important benefit from
participating in the retreat was that,
through certain exercises, each
member’s personality was able to
surface. '

“We had an exercise where we all
learned to juggle. It was funny
because no one knew how tojugﬂe
and everyone would be cheering the
others on," Stram said.

Although motivation 'was the
principal point ofthat exercise, SGB
member Bob Kramer said he real-
ized something more. “We aren't
going to be eight board members
and a president — we’re going to
work together as a team," Kramer
said.

The retreat was not all work for
the board. There was time to swim
and visit the hotel's lounge.

Board members said they 
their enthusiasm will catch on
among the student population. “We
want to make the board accessible to
students. Their interests and input
are welcome," Stram said.

The latest attempt to organize the
Pitt Book Center has been rejected
by the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board because the proposed
bargaining unit 'did»not include uni-
versity personnel with similar job
descriptions.

“[The ruling] was very anticipated
on our behalf,“ university counsel
Ron Talarico said. “Several years
ago the faculty staff at Pitt attempt-
ed to unionize itself. An election was
was held and a majority voted
against it. At the time the PLRB
spelled out that if there ever was to
be a union it should be given to dif-
ferent people in certain classifica-
tions ~ secretaries, administrative
assistants and so on.

“We felt very comfortable know-
ing the staff at the Book Center

. could not set up a unit, or a collec-

tive bargaining unit."

Nearly a year ago the Book Center
administrators were accused of
union-busting activities by five
employees whom they dismissed and
suspended. The actions came Janu-
ary 1983 after a union card-signing
effort began in late December 1982.

University attorneys contended
the employees were disciplined for
refusing to work overtime hours
during peak buying hours and ver-
bally abusing their immediate
supervisors.

The employees, represented by
the Allegheny Joint Regional Board
(AJRB), claim the penalties were
related to their union organizing
efforts.

The PLRB last month denied a
petition filed by the AJRB seeking
to establish a union within the book-
store, separate from the university.

  

 

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January ll, 1984

“After a hearing by the PLRB in
October to determine whether we
could organize the Book Center, the
labor board issued a statement that
we had to organize all employees [at
Pitt] and not just those at the Book
Center," said AJ RB spokesman
Tom Scheid.

“Looking at it now, we won't
[seek an all-encompassing university
union], though it may still be possi-
ble in the future.”

Scheid and another AJRB asso-
ciate, Dan Coffman, have been
representing former bookstore
employees Charles Delaney and Tim
Brady since both were fired Jan. 18.
The two terminations came along-
side separate one-day suspensions of
William Cox, Victor Sciullo and
Mark Beck.

In different PLRB hearings since
then, examiners from the board’s
Pittsburgh branch have upheld the
university‘s contention that Delaney
and Brady, as well as the three oth-
ers, were fired for verbally abusing
their immediate supervisors and for

refusing to work overtime during
peak buying hours.

Additionally, the state’s Office of
Employment Security twice ruled
against Delaney and Brady in their
attempt to regain lost wages.

The PLRB detailed unit determi-
nation at Pitt in order to determine
the composition of a collective bar-
gaining unit and to avoid overfrag-
mentation of campus labor unions.

“The PLRB has clearly indi-
cated," Talarico explained, “that if
there is to be a union among white-
collar employees, then it would be
all staff employees at the university
otherwise not represented by a
union. And that includes all
branches of the university.”

lf bookstore employees want to
associate themselves with a collec-
tive bargaining unit, it would take
the cooperation of many other uni-
versity empl'oyees.

“If there‘s an indication from
other university employees to organ-
ize," Scheid said, “we would be
happy to help them out. We’re here

if the university employees want to
contact us. It would be a bigjob, but
we’re not afraid of handling that."

This latest setback has disap-

pointed Scheid in his and Coffman’s,

attempt to prove that earlier, prema-
ture signs of union-busting were
indeed evident at the Book Center.
But another employee, who asked to
remain anonymous and was unaf-
fected by last year's disciplinary
steps, cannot shake the idea that the
AJRB fell short in aiding the
employees‘ cause.

“I have my personal doubts and
can’t help but think whether [AJ RB]
did their best to give Tim and Chuck
a fair shake. Were they [representa-
tives] really up against something
that strong‘? ‘

“Everyone got discouraged after
Tim and Chuck were fired. There
was declining interest in the union.
People started getting discouraged.
You've got to keep in mind that peo-
ple in the bookstore felt so helpless.
The university has all this power."

 Book Center unionization attempt shelved

Since January I983 the two
organizers have held at least four
meetings to provide updated infor-
mation on their progress toward
establishing a collective bargaining‘
unit.

“We were available at all times
and still intend to be,” Scheid said.
“We last had a meeting on

December 19, gave advance notice ,

and said the purpose of that meeting
was where we were at and how we
got there."

Scheid said, however, that setting
up that collective unit was secondary
to the matter of upholding Brady's
and Delaney’s appeal to win back
their jobs and lost wages.

Once that score was settled, in the
spring, “we began to research
whether we could organize the Book
Center employees," Scheid said.
“We then found out it would be
almost impossible to do that. But we
went in and tried anyway. We had an
idea of doing that and giving the
Book Center people an opportuni-
ty.‘ Scheid referred on numerous
occasions to the PLRB’s State
Office Building location as a source
foricase studies similar to that of the
bookstore's. Precedents did not
leave him with much hope.

“The labor board over the past
several years is encouraging a wall-
to-wall unit, I believe is the lingo,”
Scheid said. “They didn’t want
overfragmentation.”

“At this stage the climate is such
that the staff as a whole isn’t partial
to an all-encompassing union,”
Talarico admitted. “We already
have established a good in-house
grievance procedure.

“We also offer binding arbitra-

tion, and the pay raises during the
last couple of years are comparable
to other outside firms and govern-
ment agencies. The administration's
position is there’s no need for a
union. Best interests can be met

Corruption
goes on...

Yesterday’s conviction of former EPA CXCCUUVC Rita
Lavelle gives her the dubious distinction of being the first
high-ranking Reagan Administration official to be sentenced
to prison for a felony committed during the performance of

’ official duties.

Ms. Lavelle’s conviction should be applauded as one'of the
few successful prosecutions in an otherwise ineffective session
of congressional hearings. To avoid any further blemishes on
its record, the Reagan Administration implemented what it
called “Stop gap” measures. Translation, President Reagan has
requested and received the resignations of more than 20 other
EPA members, including EPA chief Anne Burford.

Congress usually doesn‘t prosecute unless it has overwhelm-
ing evidence of the guilt of the accused. The lack of enthusiasm
for investigation of other EPA misconduct makes it appear
that Lavelle's conviction is a political bone being thrown to the
American public. Thus pacifying the initial public demand for
prosecution of guilty administration members while allowing
those closer to the president, like Burford, to escape without
punishment.

Although Lavelle's conviction was just, justice has not been
served. The conduct of Anne Burford, such as locking Lavelle
out of her own office and Burford’s “missing” calenders calls

-back the ominous headlines that preceded the exposure of the
Watergate cover-up.

The fact that there are parallels between the EPA scandal
and the Watergate episode does not mean that an actual cover-
up is taking place. The public should not be afraid of facing
another politically-trying time, as it suffered in the mid '70s.

America’s political/ legal institutions are strong and, for the
most part, honest. Americans should have confidence in this
system by refusing to be satisfied with a scapegoat conviction.

The press and Congress have been intimidated by Reagan‘s
charisma and are betraying the public’s trust by not pursuing
real questions of misconduct in the Reagan White House-,
as they did during the Nixon Administration.

...and on

When the dirt ﬂies, President Reagan has always managed to
duck out of the way. The tradition continues as yet another
White House‘scandal was neatly sidestepped by our com-
mander in chief. .

After two weeks of investigations and denials, Charles Wick
finally admitted he secretly tape recorded phone calls mride
during his two years as United States Information Agency
director. Wick has propagated the despicable belief, held by
many unscrupulous officials, that he‘is above the laws that
govern us all. He is an embarassment to the entire nation, if not
the president.

Wick had publicly requested and received more than $30,000
to set up an electronic security system in his home. Even though
he was warned that secret wire tapping was illegal, he pro-
ceeded to do so with a Machiavellian gusto that isreminiscent
of.l. Edgar Hoover, McCarthy, Nixon and other zealous politi-
cal usurpers.

This event is even more tragic in that after two weeks of
denials, Wick‘s confession was accompanied by a shameless
excuse. Wick tried to justify his illegal actions by claiming he
was just “trying to extend the reaches of [his] own memory."
This excuse, although acceptable to President Reagan, is com-
pletely unacceptable by the American people.

President Reagan must accept responsibilty for this incident
in the same manner he did for the bombing of Marines in

Beirut. If the president wishes to be re-elected in the fall, he

must prove to America that he will not tolerate underhanded,

illegal activities in his White House: ' ‘  ‘ " ‘ ' "I ”

The Pitt News was never a much
respected newspaper, not even
among Pitt students. Three times a
week it came out. tellingus about
campus activities.

Sensational stories of homosex-
ual activity in the Cathedral
appeared on the headlines. Now The
Pitt News has become a swinging
singles advertisement. Witness the
Dec. 5 Personals Section: “Tower
 gigolo now accepting reserva-
tions for December....“ .

Hasn't this gone far enough?
Whoever this pervert is, he shouldn‘t
be allowed to place asinine adver-
tisements in The Pitt News. This
“Big C" owes an apology to the
paper tor his advertisement. Are you
a big enough man to apologize?

Brotherhood not an impossible dream

Thousands gathered in the hot
sun last August. Standing among
them, lost in the crowd before the
Washington Monument, I wished I
had been there 20 years ago when
Martin Luther King delivered his
famous “l have a dream" speech.

He had a dream, a dream still held
by so many of the older people next
to me in the sticky Washington
summer. They had seen it- all 20
years before. Deja vu. It made the
news, Peter, Paul, and Mary sang
the same folk songs, and black and
white activists alike told the crowd
what had to be done - how to make
the pendulum swing back the other
way.

Bill Cosby provided a few hum-
orous comments — someone has to
make poverty ‘sound’ funny. There
were bands playing songs listing rea-
sons why‘Reagan should go back to
Hollywood, but it wasn’t the spirited
celebration of a great man and his
great dreams I'd expected.

   
 
   

Martin Luther Kings 1963 march on Washington

 

sasliiyillm

The crowd went through all the
motions of having an important
rallv ~ selling protest buttons, t-
shirts and pennants, distributing
literature, but the feeling ofaccomp-
lishment was hushed -- almost cau-
tious. Speakers perhaps sensed this
as they told us our future didn’t look
nearly as bleak as it had for King's
first followers.

It wasn‘t that King did not
accomplish the goals he’d set before
being stopped by an assasin‘s bullet;
it was the inescapable knowledge
that there was more effort being
spent securing these gains and fight-
ing the same battles from 20 years
ago than there was spent striving for
more. True, the most blatant viola-
tions of civil rights have disap-
peared, but it doesn‘t follow that the
problems of prejudice, poverty, and
discrimination are solved.

The backtracking which civil
rights groups have been forced to

make finds its way into the news and
demonstrators around me weren't
ignorant of this. They heckled and
laughed when speakers tactfully said
the movement inspired by King had

lost some of its ground, but they also
cheered wildly when one speaker
told them they had to get together
and turn the trend around. It was a
bit more anger than enthusiasm.

1 don‘t know what the atmosphere
was the day King told Americans
what was within their reach; 1 only
have the photos in old Life maga-
zines to look at. I also don‘t know
what having a man of vision meant
to them.

The crowd that day needed more
than the over-worked songs and
ideas of a lost generation. They
needed new ideas and new strategies.
King's dead, but his dreams still call
on us to fulfill man's potential.
Peace and brotherhood are not
impossible dreams.

Room 441/ Tim Hunter

When in America, do as the Americans do

When you find yourselfin the vot-

, ing booth thisyear, it will be hard to

notice that the ballots are not writ-
ten exclusively in English.

The multi-lingual ballots are the
result of one of the most absurd
amendments to the Federal Voting
Act. This l975 amendment requires
certain areas of the country to pro-
vide ballots in languages other than
English.

The absurdity is found in the rea-
soning behind the acceptance of the
amendment. lt is designed to help
those who don't understand English.
The problem with reasoning is peo-
ple who cannot understand English
written ballots could not possibly
understand English written policies
of the candidates.

How can they make any form ofa
decision if they can’t read what the
politician has to say.

This amendment is just a reflec-
tion of a threatening movement
throughout the" United States
towards the acceptance of multi-
lingualism.

This movement is threatening to
those persons who don‘t understand
English. A strong grasp of English as
a second language helps people get
jobs, and it plays a powerful role in
their advancement toward higher
positions. '

Dr. Johnson O’Conner, from the
Human Engineering Laboratory of
Boston and of the Stevens lnstitute
of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.,
gave a vocabulary test to I00 young
men who were studying to be indus-
trial executives.

Five years later, without excep-
tion, all of those who passed in the
upper l0 percent had executive posi-
tions, while not a single member of

the lower 25 percent had become an
executive.

lt is strongly felt that part of the
ethnic ties and traditions of those for
whom English is not a native tongue
are lost once their binding language
disappears. However true or false
this perception may be, I don‘t feel
ethnic tradition should take prece-
dence over earning enough money to
feed a family.

Our high schools and other educa-
tional institutions are capable of
stopping this bilingualistic move-
ment. They can teach English to
those who have problems under-
standing it. A person could benefit
greatly once they have mastered
English. I feel that by the time a
person graduates from high school,
he or she should be able to under-
stand English without any signifi-
cant problems.

Strong ethnic ties are great; they
can only add to the richness of our
American society. However, bilin-
gualism can only take away from it.

According to Newsweek, many
Hispanics who support some bilin-
gual measures resent the suggestion
that they seek an entirely bilingual
society.

“You‘d have to be a damned fool
not to realize that English is the offi-
cial language,” said San Francisco
Hispanic leader Ralph Hurtado. “If
you don't speak English, you’re a
dishwasher."

Newsweek also states that blacks
are among those who are most
opposed to bilingualism. Many
blacks feel the language barrier has
locked them out of jobs.

“First blacks were told they would
succeed if they spoke good English,”
says state Rep. James Burke. “Then

we were told we would succeed if we
dressed right. Now they‘ve added
another ingredient. All you have to
do is learn Spanish.” .

Andy Rooney states: “It is wrong
for any large number of people to
decide they want to speak another
language because they already speak
it and because it’s part of their her-
itage. lt’s part of what Spanish-
speaking people should have been
willing to give upwhen they came
here.”

l don‘t feel the person who comes
to America hasto “give up” their
first language. lt‘s good that they
keep it as a part of their heritage.

However, I do feel they should learn
how to speak read and write the
English language —- it's a matter of
survival!

The Pitt News

Pitt’s plans to build townhouse

. units on its vacant Bouquet Street

property have been put on hold
because of the upcoming Parkway
North project.

The University of Pittsburgh has
been preparing a feasibility study in

 P3ittNews, Wednesday; January 11, 1984

conjunction with Ryan Homes Inc.
to assess the cost of building I7-20
townhouses on Bouquet Street.

If Pitt decides to to proceed with
the yet-unrevealed plan, the town-
houses will "be sold to Pitt faculty
and staff with the remainder going
going to the general public.

Assistant vice-chancellor for busi-
ness and finance John Vrana said,
“It looks like it might have come

"It looks like it might have come about, but
because of other things, it has been put on

hold. "

——J0hn Vrana

‘ about, but because of other things

[parking and traffic changes], it has
been put on hold."

Vrana said he was not certain how
long the project would remain

stalled. He also said there is concern
within the university regarding the
difficulties Pitt will endure after
Oakland becomes a major detour
for the parkway construction.

The Parkway North project will
shut down the parkway from Bates
Avenue westbound toward the city.

In addition, other major arteries like
The Boulevard of the Allies will be
closed.

With major changes in the flow of
traffic into the Oakland area, the
university is reluctant to go ahead

a wide range of disciplines. Students
are exposed to politics, different
African languages, economics, psy-
chology and history. all of which are
taught from a black perspective.

Despite the initiation of these pro-
grams as a result ofthe actions of I4
years ago. conditions are still
adverse for the university's black.
population.

“The black students are now faced
with covert and institutionalized
racism," said Pamela Hart, the first
black female elected to the universi-
ty’s Student Government Board
(SGB). '

“They [black students] are contri-
buting to this by not being actively
involved in extra-curricular activi-
ties and university departments that

. directly affect them," Hart said.

The Black Action Society is a fully
structured organization; yet out of
the l,000 to 1,500 black students at

Pitt, only 60 to 70 are actively_

involved.

Not only are black students shy-
ing away from extra-curricular
activities that are to their personal
benefit, they are also turning away
from black studies. The classes have
dwindled in enrollment, and some
have been cancelled.

“The UCEP department has an
attrition rate of 66 percent. This
department recruited approxi-
mately I95 black students this year.
Through regular admissions of the
College of Arts and Sciences,
approximately 35 black students
were admitted," Daniel said.

Black students have come upon a
great problem. The number of the
peers is dwindling rapidly, and the
number of black studies courses are
also declining.

“The object is to get involved.
know your situation and take every
step to attack the problem," said
Lyndon Kirkland, co-chairman of
the BAS Political Action
Committee. ~

rect data on black student enroll-

News in January, 1969.

At about l2:50 a.m. Wednes-
day approximately 70 blacks
entered the Chancellor‘s office
demanding to meet with I)r.
Wesley Posvar. The Chancellor
was not in. so they decided to
wait (iuards were placed at the
door as the other blacks sat
around the outer office. They
played bongo drums and
conversed. The guards allowed
people to enter and leave at the
request of the secretary.

“There was no destruction and
no trouble," the office secretary
said. “They just played the bon-
gos and talked quietly. Some of
them were muttering something
about nothing being done."

At about 3 p.m., the Chancel-
Ior returned and subsequently
met with the blacks. They talked
for approximately 30 minutes,
during which no one was permit-
ted entrance to the room.

“The black students requested
to be excused from classes today
in memory of Martin Luther
King's birthday," said Dr. Pos-
var. Dr. Posvar told them he
would allow any student who so
desired to be officially excused
from their classes yesterday.

“The students were respectful
and orderly," Dr. Posvar
repeated over and over again.

When asked if the blacks had
made any threats, the Chancellor
replied there was some “angry
rhetoric" which probably
includes “tacit threats.”

Dr. Posvar indicated that the
BAS reiterated their demands of

this past summer. They voiced a
general dissatisfaction with the
progress of the demands. “I am
dissatisfied with the progress
myself," the chancellor said. “We
have made commitments on var-

The Affirmative Action Office
reports that the number of black
professors in I983 is the same as 15
years ago and that information on
the black students who graduate

native Americans. The number of
blacks in medical and law school, for
example,has decreased while the
number of whites has increased. The
passive black students of the ’80s are
becoming lax as their environment
slowly turns against them. If this
continues, it would take another I23
years for black progress in higher
education to catch up.

Maybe it is time for the black stu-
dents of today to look back at the
history of their existence at the uni-

the importance of involving

§ McGovern runnin

By Lieselotte Visser
For The Pitt News

    

 
  
       

Many Pittsburghers are unaware
that George McGovern is running
for the presidency again. Former
Senator McGovern declared his bid
late in the race, but according to
aides, it was not a question of wait-
ing too long but of not being able to
wait any longer.

McGovern had been waiting for
one of the other Democratic candi-
dates to declare’ a platform which
was clearly different from President
Ronald Reagan‘s position, accord-
ing to director of delegate selection
Doug Fulmer. McGovern, he said,
felt compelled to enter the race in
September.

“His very entry into the race dem-
onstrated that he felt the other can-
didates weren’t being bold enough,”
Washington press secretary Mark
Kaminsky said. -

One of the boldest differences
between McGovern and the other
democratic hopefuls is his position
on military spending, according to
Kaminsky. McGovern advocates a
25 percent reduction in the proposed

to contact people willing to be dele-
gate candidates in Pennsylvania and
in several other states with early
deadlines. ‘

The campaign has met require-
ments to obtain federal matching
funds. According to aides, McGov-
ern is vying with the Rev. Jesse Jack-
son for third place behind former
Vice-President Walter Mondale and
Sen. John Glenn, generally consid-
ered to be holding first and second
place, respectively.

The McGovern campaign is con-
centrating its efforts on several key
early states. including Iowa, New
Hampshire. and Massachusetts. The
Iowa Democratic Caucus, sched-
uled for Feb. 20, will be the first in
the nation. The Iowa media have

U

g in 1984 M

given much press coverage to the
campaign.

According to campaign literature,
McGovern says his program will
enable the Democratic Party to do
more than defeat the Republican
candidate. ‘

Kaminsky said McGovern is the
only candidate who can be labeled
an “unrepentant New Dealer." He
explained McGovern looks upon
Franklin Roosevelt’s internal man-

agement as the finest in the 20th"

century. I

In contrast, Kaminsky said
McGovern describes Reagan‘s for-
eign policies as uninformed and
reckless.

According to campaign literature,
McGovern calls for a nuclear freeze
and the cancellation ofthe MX mis-
sile program and B-1 bomber pro-
duction, in addition to terminating
all military operations in‘ both
Lebanon and Central America.

“We should abandon wasteful
military spending in order to fight

the enemies from within: unemploy— *“

ment, crime, hunger, deteriorating
education...and a despoiled natural
environment,“ McGovern wrote.

The stakes are high in any cam-
paign, and Kaminsky said he is per-
sonally concerned with what
another four years of Reagan would
bring.

“The rising potential of a super-

power conflict would concern 
most." Kaminskyexplained. “All his I’

[Reagan‘s] right-wing colors would
come to the fore if he were re-
elected. He would be more danger-
ous and more unfair than ever.
Based on self interest, every Ameri-
can, even the “survivalists,“ should
be opposing the
Reagan.

‘‘I’m not at all convinced that civ-
ilization could survive another four
years of Ronald Reagan in the
White House,“ Kaminsky said.

 Pitt Law

JOHN GAMBESCIA
e Pitt News

After 17 years at Pitt’s law school,
the desk of Dean John E. Murray
Jr., will soon be bare as he ends his
seven-year deanship at Pitt to
become acting dean of Villanova’s
law school in June.

Murray’s ties to Eastern Pennsyl-
vania began early —— as a boy grow-
ing up in the Kensington area of
Philadelphia. He graduated from
LaSalle College with a degree in phi-
losophy, and went on to become edi-
tor of the Law Review at Catholic
University: After completing a mas-
ter thesis in law at the University of
Wisconsin, Murray secured his first
job in 1959, as professor of law at
Duquesne University.

In i964, Murray began teaching
at Villanova’s law school. With a
keen desire to channel all energies
into teaching and writing, he turned
down a vice deanship with Villan-
ova, and returned to Duquesne.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 11, 1984

Page 11

Dean: Readying for the next step

Soon after, the Duquesne admin-
istration presented Murray with an
offer to become the full-time dean of
their law school. However, the idea
of scholarship and education was
still too much a part of Murray’s
philosophy and he again turned
down an administrative position.

Four years later, in i967, and one
short bus ride away, Murray found
himself at Pitt as a professor of law.
He has been here ever since.

Murray has spent much of his
time teaching, as well as learning,
about contracts, commercial law
and antitrust. The author of nine
books in those areas, Murray feels
that the need for a continuing legal
education must be recognized by
lawyers and professors if they are to
keep up with the vast number of
changes in law each year.

“One of my main objectives as
dean was to develop one ofthe finest
teaching faculties in the country,”
Murray said. “In regard to our
faculty now, I feel a sense ofcomple-

tion in that my coliegues and 1 have
fostered a curriculum that has come
to be highly respected among major
law firms throughout the country."

i This emphasis upon scholarship
'stinguishes Murray from other
law school deans. Murray somehow
ifinds the time to teach several
courses each term, as well as attend-
ing to his administrative duties.

“I think it is essential to have a feel
for what is happening in the class-
room,” Murray said. “One needs to
have a working relationship with the
students, one that you cannot
achieve if you are simply the dean."

Murray offers his students more
than other deans, with his personal
involvement in their education. He
stresses the need to maximize the
potential of each student through
the use of every available resource,
including himself,

“I don’t expect my successor to
follow in my footsteps of teaching,”
Murray said. “Many deans simply
Rnnot find the time to teach, but to
me, scholarship is the most essntial
jart of academics, and to give our
students anything less would be sel-
ling them short.“

Beyond his already overbearing
workload, Murray acts as a consul-
tant in large corporation litigation.
“lt‘s the perfect opportunity to put
the classroom theory into practice,"
Murray said. “if what we teach our

students has little application to the
real world, then we are defeating our

purpose of developing a legal mind I

that can best represent their client in‘
litagation."

Murray feels that Pitt has an up’-
and-coming law school. He said that
students here work hard for their
degrees, and realize that the legal
world is much more demandingthan
a classroom.

“It happens too often that stu-
dents who enroll in the traditionally
prestigious law schools feel that's all
they have to do (get a degree). Th¢T¢
comes a time when the student can
really show the type of legal educa-
tion he recieved, and. P1tt’.s law Stu;
dents are beginning to doyjust that.
Murray said.

Ten days after the first of the year,
many are starting to give in to temp
tation and reconsider those resolu-
lions made so enthusiasticallyjust a
short time ago: to quit smoking, shed
extra pounds, study harder...the list
goes on.

If you're ﬁnding that it's easier said .

than done when it comes to sticking
to resolutions, there's one method
you may not have considered that
some people use for self-
improvement: self-hypnosis.

According to hypnotist Earl
Leeder, hypnosis is a’ “state of high
suggestability where a person can
give a suggestion to the subcon-
scious mind to be carried out without
the conscious mind's interrupting."

During hypnosis, thoughts travel
from the inner mind to the con-
scious, and suggestability is greatly
increased.

''If I have a weightlifter who comes

to me and says he wants to be Mr'

Pittsburgh, to press 200 lbs.," Leeder
said, "I'll hypnotize him [and] teach
him how to hypnotize himself. Every-
time _he goes, to lift, he'll use
hypnosis."

In order for self-hypnosis for self-
improvement to be successful, he
said, three critera must be present:

‘ need (i.e., to quit smoking because it

is a health hazard), want(motivation)
and means to Ieam it.

Dr. James Williams, a psycholo-
gist who practices in Oakland, uses
hypnosis as part of a “treatment
package" adjunct ‘with other tech-
niques with 20 to 30 percent of his

patients.
The state of high suggestability

Earl Leeder puts subject in a hypnotic trance.

By Richard Schnap and
Diane Lefkowitz-
The Pitt News

“Down in the crowd, we're down on
our knees
Wanna get out, but don't want to
succeed
We're the red-eyed legends of the
night‘ before
We're the dead mind babies of the
TV war.”
—"Our~Way"
——The Germs

You may have seen them: dressed
in black leather, boots and metal
studded wristbands, their hair cut in
spikes or in a Mohawk and dyed pur-
ple or green, wearing aT-shirt embla-
zoned with the word "Anarchy."

This is the stereotypic “punker,"
but few people who use that label
understand what punk is and agree
about what it means. Is it really the
threat to society that some make it
out to be, or is it just a strange way of
dress? If punk is an "attitude," exactly
what is that attitude about?

The answer is that punk is basi-
cally what anybody wants to make
out of it, since there are such diverg-
ing opinions about its definition: a
weird fashion trend, a new form of
rebellious consciousness or just a
passing phase in the annals of mod-
em music and popular culture.

Although opinions differ widely as

~ to what punk means, most agree that

it started as a rebellious movement in
England around 1976 as a product
of working-class anger.

Barb Madaus, Larry Anderson and
Gerry Murray are members of Toxic
Shock, a band that many consider to
be "punk" (although they don't think
they can be labelled so easily) and
were affected by the punk craze

uses hypnosis with behavior
modiﬁcation.

“I found, in my experiences, [hyp-
notism] is very successful, but l'm
not sure," Williams said. "Is there a
criterion for giving up smoking —
seven days, a month, a year?"

Self-hypnosis was successful for I

James Lukus Jr., who took a course
in it so he could have better,concen-
tration in his work with computers.
“It helped a lot,” he said, "I used to
get very hyper after looking at the
computer for awhile, so it taught me

4 to tone down a little."

Lukus found that the more often
he was hypnotized, the easier it
became to fall into a trance. He
played a tape of suggestions while
asleep so they could work their way

when it first swept America five or six
years ago.

"London had a bad economic cri-
sis at the time punk rock came out,"
Murray said, "but punk was no more
violent than the surroundings."

"It's just people saying, ‘Look, we
don't want to be controlled anymore;
we don't want to play your game,',"

Anderson said. "It started out like I

that and then turned into a fashion
show.

"Whenever anything new
happens, a kind of rebellion or any-
thing, a new kind of throwing off of
control, there's always people saying
[that] somebody's gonna buy some-
thing if they hook up with this." _

People are definitely cashing in on
the punk trend as customers empty
their wallets to buy leather clothing
and dye their hair various colors to
achieve the "punk look"

The Limited Express is one store
that carries a large line of what some
consider to be punk clothing, like
bright tights to wear with miniskirts
and Japanese proportion T-shirts -
the basic box T-shirt, very loose-
fitting, with Japanese letters
splashed on it.

“I don't consider my clothing
punk," said Limited Express man-
ager Kitty Allen. "Punk is not a way of
dress. It's an attitude more than

anything.”

The Limited Express‘ reputation
as a "punk clothes" shop comes
from its being too ahead of the aver-
age person to understand, too ahead
of the Pittsburgh customer's way of
thinking, she said.

“Very few people understand how
our clothes became the way they
are," Allen said. "Punk is not a
fashion."

"What people call punk, I call
innovative," said Scott Wilson, man-
ager of New York, New York, a down-

 

town clothing store that sells
so-called punk clothing.

"It was a movement started in Eng.
land, almost like a rebellious move
ment against politics and established
business," Wilson said.

"When punk first started, it asked

» the original question: What is the sta-

tus quo? Can we change it?" Murray
said. I think punk was a really viable
way of doing that. Then people got
freaked out by it because it was such
a radical thing. Y,

"Instead of building its own net-
work and really becoming strong, it
just became a trend."

To accommodate people wishing
to stay “in" with the trend, New York,
New York carries leather medieval
gladiator vests, chains, leather whips
and leopard T-shirts.

As unusual as these clothes may
seem, New York, New York was the
first Pittsburgh store to carry leather
miniskirts, and when they first came
in, customers laughed at them, Wil-
son said. Now they are a popular
item. "’/"

Wilson said he believes punk has
its true meaning in punk music,
beginning with the Sex Pistols, an
English group banned from that
country because their music went so
against the government.

"It waswmore of a lower-middle
class uprising," according to Denn
Vetta, an employee of New York, New
York

leather jacket, pinstriped slacks and?
studded wristbands, with three ear-
rings in his left ear and spiked hair
tinted with purple, said the trend in
punk clothing is a product of the
music.

"It was like what came out of the
'60s," he said. "Music dictates
fashion. Cher brought in bell-
bottoms."

Breaking bad habit

Many turn to hypnosis fg

into his subconscious — a normal
practice in self-hypnosis.

A state of relaxation is usually
induced to prepare the subject for
the hypnotic trance, then he listens to

a tape recorded by himself or a pro- _
gessional hypnotist with a message ’.

,

to induce trance.

Because the subconscious mind
is in control of all of the body's auto
matic mechanisms, Leeder said,
increased awareness of all senses
occurs during hypnosis: one sees
more clearly, hears things h
couldn't hear before, etc. "

At the same time, however, the
body's pulse rate and heart rate slow
down, causing relaxation. Despite-
the relaxation, he said, the subﬁifét is
acutely aware of what he is doing and
is able to focus his attention on a
pre-hypnotic suggestion.

"A trance allows the person to

' relax and really concentrate on the

suggestion," Williams said. "Most of
the time, when we think about doing
something, like studying harder or
breaking a bad habit, were usually
very distracted. With hypnosis, you
can focus in.

"Have you ever been involved in
reading a novel to such an extent that
you block out all distractidfis, so
maybe you don't hear someone call
your name? That's what happens in
hypnosis," he said.‘

This ability to block out distrac-
tions is one reason why self-hypnosis
is helpful for those who want to make
better grades, according to psychol-
ogist Leslie LeCron's Complete
Guide to Hypnosis.

‘ Although lethargy occurs during a
trance, LeCron said. one can make
the suggestion to be normally alert
and lose any feelings of listlessness.

Better concentration, attaiﬂ2’d dur-

ing self-hypnosis, is one advantage of .
studying under hypnosis; another is

an increase in reading speed, which,
if the suggestion is made, can be up

' to 10 percent faster.
Another way self-hypnosis can

There is no set style that is con‘si-.

dered to be punk, according to Vetta
-— just anything that is anti-
establishment. -

"It's like a sign of the times," he
said. “Anything goes. There are no
guidelines to fashion now."

Anything goes with hairstyles as
well as clothing’ fashions, as the
“punkish" Mohawk and spiked hair-
dos are gaining in popularity, and it is
not uncommon‘ to see a
~§j.*»nservatively-dressed person with a
clump of hair dyed magenta, green,
blue or yellow. —

More men than women come to
Great Expectations in Oakland for
punk hairstyles, according to opera-
tor Eileen Fitzhenry. ,

“They like hair that stands straight
up," she said.

Most of the customers requesting
punk haircuts and dyes are those

. who fit the image from head to foot, _

she said. .
"They wear the clothes and every-
thing, the leather boots and short

‘-‘_,sl<irts. Did you ever‘ see someone

with a lacy dress, high heels and blue
green hair?"

Operator Theresa Behun, of Philip
Pelusi hairstylers, said that whether a
hairstyle is considered to be punk
de nds on the customer.

‘There are some people who go
all out," she said. “Some people want
it just a little bit punk. To some peo-
ple, punk is getting the ears cut out.

0 others it is getting a Mohawk or
purple dye."

Behun also noticed that more

. men than women come for punk

hairstyles, but she said the trend as a
whole is losing momentum among
the older crowd and is becoming the
fashion for the teenagers.

"I guess some people are getting
tired of it," she said. ' It got so big a
while ago; everyone was into it"

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 11, 1984

One 13-year-old female customer
is satisﬁed to have her hair "slightly
punk" -— by dyeing her sideburns
purple. "It's real hair-dresser's fad
kind of thing."

A lot of customers who want a
punk haircut aren't even sure what
one is or the extent to which ﬂiey
want to take it until they get in the hair
dresser's chair, said Anna Marie Mar-
chek of Great Expectations. ,

“They really don't know what they
want," she said. "Theyjust know they
want something punk."

Dyed-in-the-wool punkers now
have special nightspots in Pittsburgh
where they can get together in an
atmosphere of familiarity and mutual
acceptance. The Electric Banana, -for
example, is one North Oakland bar
that attracts a “punkish” clientele.

The Sanctuary in Oakland fea-
tures New Music on Monday nights-
for true-to-the-heart punkers or peo-
ple who just want to dress in punk
attire and enjoy the ambiance for fun.

, "It's all fun," said Cindy Needler,
20, a student at the Pittsburgh
Beauty Academy who visits the
Sanctuary on Monday nights.

Wearing tight black leather pants,
a black T-shirt covered withfeathers
and studded wrist bands, Needler
said her outﬁt, like her black hair
streaked with ﬂashes of blonde and
red, "make, me feel good. I'm not
anti-establishment I don't want to
burn any buildings down or protest
an ing.

‘l just‘ want to have a good time,
dancing and dressing like this. I like
to be a little different, I guess."

Punk music, where most agree it
all began, accounts for about 90 per-
cent of the sales at Jim's Records in
East Liberty. According to owner Jim
Spitznagel, punk bands do the
record-making, and distributing of
their albums themselves.

material studied.

"You can do this by suggesting
that you are now going to take only
10 minutes for [studying], but that it
will seem like you are spending an

review," according to The Complete

symptoms.

Leeder said the most common
reason people have for learning self-
hypnotism is to lose weight. When a
subject comes to him for that reason,
they first establish a diet the subject
can follow.

Then he hypnotizes the subject
and tells him to obey his own sugges-
tions when he goes to eat. Certain
cues the subject will recall at the time
will stop him from eating.

"You have no desire to eat

LeCron also suggests using self-
hypnosis during exams to avoid
panic by suggesting that you will
write rapidly and block out all
distractions.

Self-hypnosis can be used not only
to break habits and improve behav-
ior, but it can also be a tool to reduce
ggue, improve one's ability to
' press himself in public and
increase an athlete's ability.

Williams and Leeder list smoking
as the hardest habit to break with

between meals now because what»

caused you to eat between meals
before is not there anymore," Leeder
said.

Self-hypnosis offers protection in

the face of temptation, acording to
Williams.

“You will remember the trained

- suggestions," he said, "which would
be to eat only foods that are good for -
you, not to eat foods that will contrib- -

ute to excess body fat and to realize
the positive aspects of losing
weight." -

Tim Moersh/ The Pitt News

Positive thinking is a lot of the
power behind hypnosis for self-
improvement, and psychological
and physical factors play about an
equal role in self-hypnosis. '

"The positive thinking is...what
actually makes it happen," Williams
said. "Those physical cues are good
as a barometer so I can tell where the
person is at a certain point."

"There isn't anything you can't do
if you put your mind to it," Leeder
said. "If you really want to learn, if t.he
burning desire is there, you can leam

it. lf you're a slow learner, it may take
twice as long, but you can learn it.
This attitude is important to the suc-
cess of hypnosis.

"It's a lot of psychology. ljust give-
[subjects] good suggestions to cany
through." -

Following his own advice. Leeder
hypnotizes himself three times a day.

An hour-long tape of successes he

wants to be motivated about the fol-
lowing day plays while he sleeps, with
suggestions going into his
subconscious.

To get a positive start on the day,
he hypnotizes himself with a tape
every moming while he's shaving.

“It has a bunch of positive sugges-
tions on it," he said. “ ‘You'll be happy
at work; today's gonna be a happy

day.’ Anything that will motivate you
instead of saying, ‘So, another day,
let me get my coffee...’ 

The depth of the trance varies
across individuals, according to
Leeder. One’s "code" of ethics" deter-

mines whether he falls into a light,
medium or heavy trance. If someone
is brought up not liking authority, he
doesn't follow orders by other people

  
   

' “It's just people say-

ing, Look, we don't
want to be controlled
anymore.” -Larry
Anderson of Toxic
Shock’

"Punk has its own network," he
said. "It's worldwide, in South Amer-
ica and Africa. It's in its fourth or ﬁfth
generation now, and there are com-
pletely different bands and fans.‘

"Fifty percent of the Dead
Kennedys fans probably just heard of
them last month, and the other half

i hates them now." ,
This transience makes and keeps

punk interesting, and the music
always seems to stay fresh.
"Most of the bandsare young kids

' right out of high school." Spitznagel

said. "Most people grow out of it,
though." "

Others take the punk rock move- '

ment with more concem. Frederick

Khan is a representative for Project

W.A.RM., the World Appeal for the"
Revolution of Music, a group that

proposes action to counteract what it

perceives as detrimental elements in

modern music.

“[The sounds of punk rock] are
twisting the minds of youth, taking
their minds off of real, serious prob-
lems," Khan said. “Minds that would
otherwise be positively developed for
the benefit of society.”

Toxic Shock's Madaus agrees that
some of the punkers‘ calls for
change aren't based on valid
problems.

“As it became more bourgeois,
you found these’ people who were
basically upper-middle class and had
rich parents who were going through

i this rebellion phase," Madaus said.

"They were screaming about ev-
erything they were told that wasfft
true.‘ Sometimes it sounded like
somebody who was really spoiled
because they weren't going to get
everything. »

Contrary to the opinions of Behun
and others who see punk as a pass-

ing trend, Khan believes the punk
concept is getting worse and more .

"vulgar" and that "the line has to be
drawn somewhere."
Whether a fanciful fashion that will

pass with the seaso_n. music mania.

or alternative to the existing estab-

lishment, punk is making a place for .

itself in our society.

Leeder; shows how hypnosis controls -pain, as this
subject doesn’t feel the flame from the lighter.

 

but would probably take his own sug-
gestions in self-hypnosis.

Although hypnotism is gaining
acceptance as a science in the medi-
cal world, skepticism as to the validity
and possible dangers still exists.

Many subjects wony that they will be
made to do something in a trance
that they wouldn't do otherwise or
that they won't emerge from the
trance at all. '

Neither of these fears could possi-
bly come true, Leeder said, and he’
‘ places the blame for these miscon-
ceptions on arnatuer or inexpe-
_ rienced hypnotists. '

"There are a lot more bad [h no-
tists] than good ones," he said. ' The

L ethical problems are very dramatic."

If you're not having much success
keeping your NewYear's resolutions,
self-hypnosis can be an agreeable
alternative to traditional techniques
on the road to self-improvement.

“It’s a lot of psychology. 1 just give (subjects)
good suggestions to carry through.”

 ’Hova ousts Pitt

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

With Clyde Vaughan, the
Panther basketball team can com-
pete with anyone in the Big East con-
ference. The 6-4 senior co-captain

has been the leading scorer and .

rebounder for Pitt the last two years.
But without him, the Panthers are
an ordinary team, without a leader,
a player who is not afraid to take the
shot in a pressure situation.

The unforseeable happened Mon-
day night in the tiny confines of the
Villanova Field House. With two
minutes elapsed in the first half,
Vaughan went down with a twisted
right ankle getting a rebound. With
the exception of one painful minute,
Vaughan was on the bench, ren-

L dered ineffective.

Pitt was left with no noticeable
scoring threat against a team trying
to break a five-game l0SlI12 streak on
their home court. A 20-point blow-

out was staring blankly in the Panth-
ers’ face.

However, Pitt fought back in the
true spirit of past squads. The
Panthers were able to cut a 15-point
first half deficit to four with four
minutes remaining as Villanova won
its first Big East game, 74-61.

Added to the Panther woes was I

horrid foul shooting. Normally
shooting 75 percent from the charity
stripe, Pitt hit only l7 for 30 (56.7
percent), including missing seven of
its first eight attempts from the line.
Still, the effort put forth was a
much-needed improvement from
the Panthers‘ listless attempt of bas-
ketball against Connecticut last
Saturday.

“Against Connecticut, we played
like dogs," head coach Roy Chip-
man said on his post-game show.
“We worked hard and had opportu-
nites, but we could not cash in.

“I can't fault the kids. It was a
good effort, but we didn’t shoot
well."

The lack of offensive production
was obvious during the last four
minutes after a Joey David layupcut
the Wildcat lead to 59-55. After Ed
Pinckney made two free throws,
freshman guard Curtis Aiken’s turn-

over turned into a Frank Dobbs_

layup. Nobody in Pitt’s lineup could
take command as six free throws by
freshman guard Harold Jensen and
a reverse dunk by Pinckney iced Vil-
lanova's fourth win against seven
losses.

For a while, it looked as though
the Wildcats would breeze. With the
game tied at nine, Villanova out-
scored Pitt, 24-9 utilizing a full-
court press. ,

Chipman was displeased with
playing at the Cat House, a 3100-
seat facility which literally brings the
fans into the game. There is little
room between the end line and the
stands, which proved to hurt Pitt in
the first half.

“This is the most ridiculous place
to play,". he said. “Everyone else
plays at the Palestra.”

Were it not for second halves, the
Lady Panther basketball squad
would be finding life in the Big East
troublesome indeed.

In their second conference meet-
ing, Pitt’s women in white followed
their new script to a T, putting on a
second-half performance that easily
covered the first-half deficit — all

nifer Bruce -— in devouring George-

House, 81-64.

Locker rooms seem to have a mys-
terious effect on these hoopsters,
who have developed a tendency to
execute dramatic comebacks after
trailing for much of the first twenty
minutes.

“They had a lot ofintensity in the
second half,” remarked Hoya coach
Cheryl Thompson, who has just
taken over Georgetown’s reins.
“They were a lot more aggressive,
and we don’t play enough freelance
basketball."

Trailing by three at the half, 31-
34, the home team “came alive,”
according to Pitt head coach Judy
Saurer. “I would say it was our
rebounding and foul shooting that
made the difference in the second
half. They were abominable [in the
first period].“

That may be an understatement.
Saurer‘s squad shot a despondent 33
percent from the line and 40 percent
from the field in the first half. Fol-
lowing the break, the Lady Panthers
rose to a 5l.7 field goal percentage
and skyrocketed to a 71.4 foul shot
percentage.

Saurer explained the basis for the
sorry statistics. “You have to play
with intensity. You have to attack."

 

Rozierless

The increased aggressiveness by
the Pitt players is evident not only in
the final score, but in the rebounding
as well. The hosts managed to find
only 12 boards during the first
period as opposed to 24 in the
second.

Saurer credits the bench with
igniting the comeback. “Our sub-
bing ability really helps us," said the
coach. “Becky Maziarz came in and
did a really nicejob, and Lisa Fubio
was tremendous. Ellen Gilhooley
(seven rebounds) came in and really
handled the ball well, and was very
effective defensively.”

The three relievers combined for
2] points, but Saurerdoes not forget
her regulars. One starter that
receives little recognition for her
ball-handling acuity is sophomore
guard Kim Tirik.

“Tirik took control in the game
and is really doing a great job for us
in directing the plays.” Tirik shot
four of five from the field for eight
points and handed out seven assists.

rival Seton Hall. Coach Saurer lik-

and skies, and we also need to watch
out for [Marcia] Foster and [Leslie]
Fairbanks.

“They’ve got the personnel,”
Saurer concluded. “If we can beat
them, it will prove how tough we
are.”

High scorers for last night’s game
were Jennifer Bruce (26 points, 10
rebounds) and Julie Callan (22
points, 12 boards). Alyson West-
brooks led the Hoyas with 20 points
and eight rebounds.

The game was televised by Home
Sports Entertainment, the team’s
second before the camera.

After a month layoff, the Panther
track team, led by returning NCAA
I10-meter high hurdle champion
and Pan-American Games gold
medalist Roger Kingdom and I000-
meter NCAA finalist Todd Colas,
travels to the University of North
Carolina Invitational this weekend.

Kingdom and Colas have already
qualified for the 1984 NCAA Cham-
pionship Meet, by virtue of their
performances at the George Mason
Christmas Invitational. Kingdom
qualified in the 55-meter high hur-
dles with his time of7.03 while Colas
was clocked at 2:22.71 in the I000-
meter run.

Both will be handed stiff tests on
Saturday.

Kingdom will face Charles Foster,
a 1976 Olympian, and Reggie
Towns, an All-America alongside
the heralded Willie Gault at Tennes-
see. ,

Kingdom has yet to face Foster
but defeated Towns and Gault at the
NCAA Championship in June of
1983.

“It’s been difficult in preparing for
this meet, mentally," Kingdom said.
“I've been running against the clock.
When you’re not used to racing
against good competition, like this

weekend, it makes it that much
tougher.

“I want to become more specific in
my technique. I hope to get out of
the blocks faster and over the hur-
dles more smoothly."

Colas must defeat Edwin Koeche
of Richmond. In 1983, Koeche was
the NCAA champion in the event.

“The purpose of this meet is to see
how much we have progressed,"
Panther coach John Vasvary said.
“But for guys like Todd and Bill
[Moorhead], who have more expe-
rience, this meet has greater
importance.”

Vasvary will take 32 participants
to compete in l6 events.

In the sprint events to be con-
tested, the Panthers boast quality
and depth. In the 60-yard dash,
senior football star Joe McCall
headlines a basically freshmen-

«studded group, including Gerard

Battle, Jesse Mikell and Darryl
Spruill. .

In addition to Kingdom, the 60-
yard hurdle corps consists of Jason
Harris, Jeff Longbottom, Dwayne
Milloy and McCall.

Sophomore Rich Baderinwa,
whom Vasvary considers his most
valuable sprinter, combines with
Mikell in the 440-yard dash.

In the middle distance events (the
600-yard run, the 880-yard run, the
I000-yard run and the mile). the

Panther track team to (INC ..

Panthers also have a well-stocked
crew.

Freshman‘ Alan Laws highlights
the 600-yard competition. Senior
All-America Garland Brown and
freshman Tim Manes are scheduled
to compete in the 880-yard run.

Colas and All-America Bill
Moorhead will go in the I000-yard
run, yvhile freshmen John Thomas
and Bob Weiner team with Colas in
the mile.

The Panthers will field two relay
teams: the distance medley team of‘
Baderinwa, Brown, Moorhead and
Colas, and the mile relay team of
Baderinwa, Mikell, Harris and
Shane Saunders.

In the field events, Kingdom will
be competing in the high jump, and
freshman Kevin Heglar will do the
long jumping.

The pole vaulting chores will be
handled by two freshmen, Jim John-
son and Bill Lance, and a junior,
Rodney Chobany. ~

In the triple jump, Heglar and
senior Ralph Mitton are scheduled,

while senior Andrew Berry will han— '

die the shot putting. ‘

Other teams expected to attend
are North Carolina State (the
returning Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence champions), Duke, East Carol-
ina and Richmond, among others.

“For the more experience they
gain, the less they are freshmen,
experience wise," Vasvary said. “As
a team, we’re running well. We_
expect our guys to do well."

Lady Panthers to OSU Invite

By Maria Garcia I
And Charlie O'Hara

The PtlLhlews

This weekend, the Lady Panther
track team travels to Columbus,
Ohio, for the Ohio State Invitational
and the opening of the 1984 indoor
season.

As of Tuesday evening, coach
Elbert Kennedy was nearing his
decision on who would be making
the trip.

“As of right now [4230 p.m. Tues-
day], six may be going," he said.
“After this workout, it might two or
three.”

Junior Renee Henderson head-
lines the list of Lady Panthers tenta-
tively scheduled to compete.
Henderson, the returning Big East
55-meter dash champion, will run
the 55-meter and 300-meter dashes
in addition to competing on two
relay teams — the 4x200 (800 meter)
and the 4x400 (1,600 meter).

“She's in fair shape,” Kennedy
said. “We don’t emphasize the
indoor sea-son too much. We try to

In an effort to replace hurdler-
who
graduated last year, ‘Kennedy
brought in two freshmen, Felicia
Blake (South Orange, N.J.) and
Edith Butler (Mount Vernon, N.Y.).

“They both ran indoor track in
high school,” Kennedy said. “It
won’t big a transition for either of
them."

Butler will run the 400-meter dash
and the two relays, and Blake will
compete in the 500-meter run and
the 4x400 meter relay.

Other Lady Panthers scheduled to
perform are sophomores Gail
Counts and Sue Torre. Counts will
run the 55-meter dash and the two
relays. Torre is entered in the 55-
meter and 400-meter dashes while
also participating in the 4x200 meter
relay.

The lone Lady Panther distance
runner to compete is sophomore
Amy DiFrancesco. She will compete
in the 1,500-meter and the 3,000-
meter runs.

“The meet is basically an evalua-

see where we are. Before the holi-
days, we trained really well. We‘re a
little behind where we were before
the holidays.“

Attending the meet aside from
Ohio State, one of the top teams in
the competitive Big 10 conference,
will be Eastern Kentucky, Ohio Uni-
versity, Kent State and Tennessee as
well as many of the smaller schools
in Ohio and Kentucky.

The team’s goal, according to
Kennedy, “is to establish ourselves
as an up and coming program.”

Some Big East basketball coaches
consider the equality that will be evi-

a, dent in I984 season a blessing. Sev-

eral others will depend on parity to
mask key losses, content to avoid
disasters in a transition year.

There is no arguing that the con-
ference will be different than in pre-
vious seasons. First there are Top 10
teams, Georgetown and Boston Col-
lege, both deep in players, ready to
challenge for the national
Championship.

The Hoyas and Eagles are not
concerned with parity since they are
the rulers of a conference where
upsets are the rule rather than the
exception.

Next, there are the ever-conniving
and plotting tribe of Villanova, Syr-
acuse, St. John‘s, Pitt and Connecti-
cut, who are looking for solutions to
graduation losses, and the lack ofan
inside man and weak execution on
the fast break.

And last, perhaps even least, is the
sorry duo of Providence and Seton
Hall. They should favor that these

9 two can associate their names with

Big East basketball.

son, his Hoyas reeling from a 1983
Mideast Regional semifinal round
defeat to Memphis State, likes to
think nowadays that his squad has
matured, gained one year of

Georgetown coach John Thomp-B

experience.

Thompson returns for his l2th
year with the best production man in
the country, Patrick Ewing. The 7-0
junior grabbed All-American
honors again in, l983 for his awe-
some defensive skills in grabbing
10.4 rebounds per game and swat-
ting away 106 shots. He will be
shooting for a third straight Big East
Defensive Player of the Year
distinction.

In Thompson‘s eyes, the Common
Era has yet to see the real Ewing
perform.

“So far, it’s all been a learning
experience for him, a baptism by
fire," the said. “He has come in dur-
ing the years we're getting so much
attention; I have to make sure he
profits from it. l’m hoping we’re'
mature enough to take advantage of
Patrick. There’s no question of his
being double-teamed, triple-teamed.
Its more important that our people 6
take advantage of that and will take
experience and maturity to do so.”

Leading the Hoyas in steals and
assists last year is Georgetown’s only
returning senior, 6-2 guard Gene
Smith. Bolstering the backcourt will
be sophomores Horace Broadnax
and Michael Jackson, a starter last
season.

Providing backup is Thompson's
prize recruiting grab, freshman Reg-
gie Williams from roundball power
Dunbar High School in Baltimore.

knee injury, Brown- is back at for-

ham will have to do more than draw
matchsticks for two spots.

This could be the year Boston‘

College sheds its “almost-made—it”
image. The Eagles in one of only
three teams to reach the Final 16 the
last three tournament races.

“Each year, we try to have the best
possible team that the coaches and
players together can accomplish,”
Eagles coach Gary Williams said. “If
we are good enough, those other
things like finishing in the Final l6
take care of themselves. Our team’s
personality and willingness to work
will determine how good we will be.”

Off a regular-season conference
championship, the Eagles will have
all systems go, relying on senior for-
ward Jay Murphy and 5-10 junior
guard Michael Adams, two of Willi-
ams’ four returning starters. Both
can get you at least 16.5 ppg in the
fast—break, pressure-defense games
Williams employs. .

“We have a good inside player
there," Williams said of Murphy,
who can shoot equally well from the
outside. “He’s one of the better for-
wards around. Adams is one of the
most exciting point guards in the

country. Hopefully, we'll have a
couple more people to contribute to
make us a better team.“

McGuire reads Knight

 

We got the right man. Bobby
Knight’s style fits. It’s aggressive
play with maximum discipline.

And we've got the players in
Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan,
Keith Lee, Wayman Tisdale,
Sam Perkins and Melvin Turpin.
I mean, players. These guys are
mature, mentally tough, physical
Secretariats, and the majority of
them are space eaters, with huge
appetites.

But in spite of all that, I bet
Coach Knight a dinner that we
don’t win the gold medal in bas-
ketball at the 1984 Olympics. I
hope I lose the bet, but make my
steak rare, please. Its not that
we‘ve gotten any softer. but the
European countries have really
gone Park Avenue during the
last eight years. Especially
Yugoslavia, which I think now
has more seven footers than
Communists, and Russia, which
is already a formidable
opponent.

At curtain time, these coun-
tries will show off steady clubs,
thoroughbreds who have been
playing together for many years,
performing under international
rules, and playing with officials
you normally can’t communicate
with because of a language
barrier.

Don’t get me wrong; Coach

Knight has won the NCAA‘

twice, he's won the NIT, and the
gold at Pan Am. He’s like the
Alexander of college basketball
with no worlds left to conquer. I
have no doubt there's nobody
better than Coach Knight to lead
the American contingent. A lot
of people think that Bobby
shouldn't have done this thing or
that, but hey, he’s the best.
Whether you like him or dis—
like him. there’s no way you can
:kl'10Cl'( his coaching. He’s bullet-
proof, what Dr. Naismith had in
mind. He‘s got the corners

-covered, right out of the gate.

Ballplayers who go to Indiana
know more about Bobby Knight
than we know about them. They
know it's a chart, machine—gun
type operation, and who‘s in
charge. He makes his players
play to their capacity.

l‘ve always said, coaching is
forcing a guy "to take an extra
step. Bobby Knight gets them to
leap over tall buildings in a single
bound...and like it.

In my opinion, Bobby Knight
is more an American of yester-
year, Gen. Patton, The Ameri-
can flag and apple pie.
Sometimes his vocabulary gets

tug-boatish. He’s the most intim-
idating coach to other coaches in
the country. But he’s also the guy
you want in charge in a sand
fight.

The only thing wrong with
Bobby Knight are his sport

coats. If he ends up in the sleazy

part of town, he‘d get mugged for
l'IlS sport coat. The problem is, no
matter how good the conductor,
the band must still play the
music, and our arrangement
stinks. Starting a team out two
months before the games is just
not enough. Hoops is a team

game. There's no ‘‘I’‘ in team,
and I see problems.

Another reason I feel we won't
get the gold ring is our collegiate
players, being young, will be
basketball—logged before they
ever get uptown. They played
last year, in Caracus, Venezuela,
and Edmonton, Canada, and
they will have gone through a
trying NCAA tournament sea-
son. To then have to regroup for
a trial of 60 players that eventu-
ally become l2 isjust too drain-
ing, physically and mentally.

So, I would certainly like to
lose the meal to the coach and eat
crow, but ljust think we’re going
to have to change our format if
we want more than seashells and
balloons in Los Angeles.

First, the ballplayers are going
to have to make their commit-
ment a year before, so they can
travel to Europe and Asia, to get
accustomed to the rules, the offi-
cials, and to each other. They’re
going to have to learn to do as the

.Romans do, and do it better, if

they want an edge. Like I said,
it’s not 1976 in Montreal. It's
eight years later, and the Euro-
peans are definitely on the
uptick.

Sellers key for Dukes

It‘s a scene Duquesne head
basketball coach Jim Satalin
could only envision in his worst
dreams. Well. Satalin was rudely
awakened last Saturday after-
noon when sophomore forward
Emmett Sellers was carried from
the court by teammates Dwayne
Rawls and Marcus Long.

With the Dukes holdinga tight
three-point edge over strong
George Washington, Sellers
drove down the lane and lofted
up one of his patented jump
shots. In the process, Sellers was
hammered by gargantuan
Colonial center Mike Brown.

The shot fell helplessly to the
floor. So did Sellers.

“It hurts," said Sellers, after
being‘ swamped by reporters
after the game. “I was putting up
a shot from inside the lane, and I
think I landed on that big guy’s

foot and just twisted it. But boy, ‘

does it hurt. It hurts like hell."

An ice pack was prescribed for
his swollen right ankle, which
may scratch Sellers from the
Dukes’ lineup for Saturday
night’s clash with Pitt at the Field
House. He is definitely benched
for tomorrow night’s Atlantic l0
clash at Penn State.

But one thing is certain,
Panther fans surely aren’t griev-
ing over Sellers‘ injury.

The last time Duquesne and
Pitt did battle, in the opening
round of the Golden Triangle
Classic last month, Sellers out-
shone Clyde Vaughan by pump-
ing in 24 points to Vaughan‘s 20.
The Duquesne soph scored 46
points in the two-night tourney
to lead all scorers. In fact, were it
not for George Allen's leading
Pitt's two comeback wins to cap-
ture the tournament title, Sellers

Emmit Sellers

was a lock for the tourney‘s Most
Valuable Player Award.

Sellers also leads Duquense in
the statistics departments, aver-
aging l8.l points and nine
boards per game as a second-
year starter for Satalin.

He first attracted Satalin‘s
attention as a first-team All-New
Jersey selection. He averaged
just over 20 points per game to
pace Vailsburg High School to
the Newark City League title in
his senior year.

Ever since the two met, they
have become inseperable.

Bonaventure, and Sellers made
the move to Duquesne with
Satalin when he came here last
year.

Sellers tallied 10 points per
game last season at both guard
and forward. But at the outset of
this season, Satalin tossed him
back to the forward’s spot, where
he starred in high school.

But chances are the Panthers
may not confront Sellers at Fitz-

gerald Field House this year.

Besides the effort, (‘hipman
praised the defensive play on l’inck—l
ney who, despite leading live V1llan—
ova players in double figures, did
not hit a field goal until ten minutes
into the game.

“We did a good job on Pinekney,”
he said. “He got two or three baskets
off hreakaways when they spread us
out.”

But Pitt’s offense was stalled with-
out Vaughan. Andre Williams led
the Panthers with l3 points, but he
was only three for eight from the
floor. Aiken was the only other Pitt
player in double figures with ten,
and he shot five for seven from the
floor, but two baskets came late in
the game when the outcome was
decided.

“We know Curtis can score,"
Chipman said. “He can put some
points in. But we need more produc-
tion from George Allen and Andre
Williams."

The Panthers (0-3 in Big East
play) proved that they can stay com-
petitive without Clyde Vaughan.
But they do need another consistent
scoring threat if they are to avoid
second division status in the
conference.

Pitt. 

In a meet which could determine
the best in, the East, the Lady
Panther swim team travels Saturday

I to State College to face Penn State.
Both teams are undefeated during
the dual meet season; Penn State is
6-0 while Pitt has defeated Michi-
gan, Kent State and Syracuse.

Coach David Belowich expects
the toughest test the Lady Panthers
have seen so far this year from the
Lady Lions, who won the Eastern
Championship last winter. ‘

“Penn State is perhaps the best
team on the schedule,” he said.
“They are a really strong team with a
lot of depth. -This is where their
strength lies — if they don’t win,
they’ll take second or third."

The only swimmer Penn State lost
to graduation last year was Sandra
Bizal, currently an assistant to Belo-
wich. But the Lady Lions have com-
pensated with a transfer from North
Carolina State, Doreen Kase, who
was a three—time All-America for the
Wolfpack.

“Doreen swims the events that
Sandy was in,” Belowich said. “Both
Sandy and Doreen are compatible.”

In past years, depth has been a
problem for the Lady Panthers. But
with the banner crop of recruits the
last two years, this situation has
been remedied. Despite the fact 20 of
23 swimmers and divers are either"
freshmen or sophomores, the lack of
collegiate swimming experience has
not hurt the squad.

A prime example is Susan Hick-
man. The native of Orlando, Fla.,
has already broken Kathy Stetler’s
record in the 50-yard freestyle
against Michigan, covering the dis-
tance in a time of 23.41. The effort

 

also qualiﬁed Hickman for the
’NCAA championships in March. In
the I00-yard freestyle, Hickman is
among the top 25 in the world.

Other freshmen who have con-
tributed are Stacy Moller, Chris
Kaucher, Tracy Pfister and Jodi
O'Neil. It is the latter two, however,
who create some problems for the
opposition.

“Both Tracy and Jodi are really a
delight to work with," Belowich

said. “They have a lot of ﬂexibility.
They cause headaches for opposing
coaches, since they don’t know
where we will put them in the
lineup.‘' ,‘

A loss Belowich must cope with is
Laura Barber. The junior from
North Allegheny High School
slipped in her dormitory room and
ripped her hamstring.

One advantage Pitt has is that
they are coming off some intense

anther -PSU rivalry

training over the holidays in San
Juan, Puerto Rico. Instead of work-
ing on tans, Lady Panthers
swimmers each swam 77,000 meters
over eight consecutive days.

“We're n excellent shape,” Belo-
wich said. “Wejust have to go after
it. I think we have the personnel to
race with Penn State: Individual
races will be decided by hundredths
of a second.”

The meet can also be determined
by the diving events, which account
for 16 points. The Lady Panthers
have the strongest team in years with
sophomores Tricia Schultz and Jen-
nifer Brown and freshman Tricia,

Ney. For the first time in three years, ‘

Pitt divers have made the NCAA
Pre-Qualification meet in Annapo-
lis, Md. Both Schultz and Brown
qualified for the meet earlier this
season.

Men face

No.1 Lions‘

This weekend Penn State hosts
the Panther swim team at Happy
Valley. This Penn State squad could
be the best in the school‘s history.
The Lions werejust ranked the No. I
team in the East.

“We’re a little bit ofan underdog,"
Pitt coach Fred Lewis said. “We’ll
have to start the medley relay [the
first event] with a win.”

Penn State has contestants that»:

have recorded faster times than Pitt_
in 12 of the 13 events.

Only Panther sophomore Donald
Martin, a 200-meter breaststroke
specialist, has posted a faster time
than his PSU counterpart.

“Basically, we have to swim our
strengths,“ Lewis said. “We cannot
try to counter because it’s Penn
State."

The Panthers are led by senior co-
captain Ed Bahan, who will swim
the sprint events (the 50- and I00-
meter freestyle).
Bahan must win both events.

The distance event chores (the
500- and I000-meter distances) will
be handled by freshman Tom Shau-
linski. His performance is vital.

A top-notch performance must
also be turned in by Donald Martin
in the individual medley (50 meters
of all four strokes, the butterfly, the
back, the breast and freestyle) and
the 200-meter breast stroke.

Of paramount importance,
though. in Lewis‘ mind, will be the

standing of his two relay teams, thz; ‘

400-meter medley and the 400-meter
freestyle.

“To win the meet, we have to win
both," he said.

The Panthers play host to'LaSalle
at Trees Hall next week.

Cirapplers to start marathon session  

‘Eastern Wrestling League match-

up.
Saturday, Pitt takes to the road
and heads to Morgantown to take
on West Virginia University in an
EWL contest. According to Stot-
tlemyer, West Virginia has the best
team they’ve had since their present
coach Craig Turnball took over the
program.

West Virginia will also be out to
avenge last year’s Pitt victory,
according to Stottlemyer, so it could
be a very exciting match.

“The first two matches are big
because they’re great competition,”
Stottlemyer said. “The second two,
Millersville and West Virginia, are
very important because they‘re
league matches."

“This is like the national tourna-
ment. If you're going to ‘win a
national championship, you'll have
to win four or five matches in a cou-
ple days. 1 don’t think the guys will
complain because they know what
they have to do to win.”
