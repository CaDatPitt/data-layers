Phone dead?

 

If you were one of the
unlucky people trying to call
off campus between 3:30 and
3:45 on Wednesday, you were
only one of 600,000 other Pitts-
burghers who liacl difficulty.

There were no outside lines
to be found anywhere on cam-
pus. and most of the telephones
in Oakland and Downtown
also appeared to be down.

No, it wasn’talien beings tak-
ing over Bell Telephone. The
problems were a result of a
radio contest held by WHY W in
which $100,000 was being given
to a lucky Pittsburgher.

John Heirmerl, national
program director for the Benz
Broadcasting System, owners of
Y97, estimated that 500,000 to 1
million people picked up their
telephones at the same time to
call the station.

The radio station told its lis-
teners a month ago that the
song “Who Can it Be Now?”
would be played in its entirety
sometime in the future. When
listeners heard the song, they
were supposed to call the sta-
tion, and the 97th caller would
win $100,000. The station went
as far as telling listeners the
exact day and time the song
would be played, so Pitts-
burghers were prepared to start

dialing their telephones at 3:35
p.m. on Oct. 13. _

Heimerl said after the first 10
callers got through to the radio
station (approximately 1 min-
ute and 45 seconds after the con-
test began) all the telephone
lines in the downtown area
went dead.

Y97 purchased a high volume
exchange (333) from Bell Tele-
phone to handle all the calls a
radio station receives, but
according to Heimerl, Bell did
not give him any specifics on’
how many calls could be
handled.

‘It wasn't the 333 exchange
that failed, but individual
exchanges, such as Pitt's 624
exchange.

I-Ieimerl, who was handling
all the calls, said he was talking
to the callers at the beginning of
the contest to prove to the
audience that real people were
calling in. By the time the 30th
caller reached the station, Bell
Telephone got nervous and told
Y97 to hurry the contest along
or there was the possibility of a
telephone blackout in the city.

Heimerl, who has been in the
radio business for 16 years, said
he didn’t think that the contest
would have such an impact on
the’city. 

“It’s kind of scary,” .he said.‘

Candidates
Discuss

Arms Race

By RAY WUSLICH

Local congressional candi-
dates——some from parties outside
the political mainstream——argued
Wednesday night about the merits
of a nuclear freeze during a forum
sponsored by Pitt’s Arms Race
Study Group. '

The candidates included: Dee
Ann Rathbun, a member of the
Socialist Worker's Party from the
22nd Congressional District; Wil-
liam Kalman, also of the Socialist
»Worker’s Party from the 14th Con-
gressional District; Congressman
William Coyne, a Democratic
incumbent from the 14th Congres-
-sional District; and David Travis,
Libertarian candidate in the 20th
Congressional District.

Rathbun told the crowd of 30
people that a board-based social‘
movement is needed to challenge
the rulers right to wage a war.

Rathbun opposed the idea of a
nuclear freeze. She believes it is
another way to oppress and dis-
criminate against developing
countries. .,

“Even the proposal for no
further deployment of weapons
swings the political motion of the
movement in the wrong direction,

us M ust Live With Second Place Status

Country Has Fallen Behind in Production

By PEGGY FERRI

The United States has to wake
up and realize that it can no longer
compete with Japan in mass pro-
duction, according to Professor
Robert Ayres of the department of
engineering and public policy,
Carnegie-Mellon University.

Speaking at a lecture entitled
“Robotics and the Third Industrial
Revolution”, Ayres said that the
U.S. has to learn to live with this
and concentrate on what it can pro-
duce instead. The lecture was spon-
sored by the Univesity Honors
Program Student Cabinet.

“We have to sell in the world
market because we have to buy in
the world market,” Ayres said. He
added that the United States’
dependence on imports makes the

away from the idea that working
people all over the world must stop
war,” Rathbun said. “It says, in
effect, that it’s OK for Israel to have
the bomb, but don’t give it to the
Palestinians. It’s OK for South
Africa to have the bomb, but don’t
give it to the Angolans.”
Rathbun said, “the worst crimi-

rials in the world” possess nuclear
capabilities, including the United
States. She also said it is America’s
responsibility to end the arms race.

“There is only one country that i

Q can put an end to the arms race-—

the one that initiated it. which pro-
pelled it to gargantuan propor-
tions, which opposed every initia-
tive for disarmament and t_he only
one which ever dropped an atomic
bomb—the United States,” Rath-
bun said.

“The Soviet Union is not really a
problem,” Rathbun continued,
“they were forced into the arms
race as a defensive necessity. Every
disarmament proposal has come
initially from the Soviet Union-
the freeze proposal, the Test Ban
Treaty, the no first-use pledge,”
Rathbun said.

The United States pursues a pol-

{Riley of aggression and refuses to

negotiate in any meaningful way,
according to Rathbun, because it
does not represent the majority of
American people.

William Kalman, a laid-off steel
worker from U.S. Steel’s Homes-
tead works, also is running on the
Socialist Worker’s Party ticket.

“The Socialist Worker’s candi-
dates support unconditional and
unilateral disarmament by the
United States,” Kalman said. “We
call for U.S. troops out of Lebanon,
out of Germany and out of Korea.
We are for the self-determination of
the oppressed.”

, Kalman maintained that, if (a
Socialist were elected to Congress,
“we would expose the lies and
hypocrisy of the American bosses,
and we would support and public-

_ize the , just struggles of the
oppressed and exploited of the
world.”

Congressman Bill Coyne
expressed hope that the candidates’
positions on the arms race would
be of interest to voters.

“I strongly support the compre-
hensive Test Ban Treaty, and I sup-
port the approval of the SALT II
treaty,” Coyne said. “I do not sup-
port the Reagan administration’s
Civil Defense Crisis Relocation
Plan. I do not believe the plan is
practical—it induces a false sense

hot security.”

In speaking about the vulnera-
bility of the United States to a first
strike attack, Coyne said that
“there are degrees of vulnerability,
and I do not believe that ours is
such as to invite a nuclear attack.”

Coyne said that he opposed the
MX missile and Trident nuclear

submarine because he believes that , ,

union suggestion of closing the
trade doors unlikely. “For

instance,” he explained, “there
isn’t one company in the U.S. that
manufactures subway cars.”

American industry has to avoid
standardization and, according to
Ayres, this will require using the
new technology of robotics, in spe-
cific, reprogrammable robots.

“Detroit has to scrap plants pro- -

ducing stuff that they can’t sell,”
Ayres said. “The plants can’t be
converted because of the rigid stan-
dardization of production.”

The Advantage of using these
reprogrammable manipulators,
Ayres said, would not only be the
speed but that they could be repro-
grammed to keep up with techno-
logicalinnovations.

our defenses are sufficient. Coyne
also said that he believesa nuclear
freeze movement is legitimate and
capable of focusing the political
debate.

“It is not the views of representa-
tives which are capable of raising
important issues like the nuclear
freeze in Congress. It is the people
of this country in town meetings,
referendums and state legislatures’
resolutions which forced the
nuclear freeze question on to the
national agenda,” Coyne said.

The Libertarian candidate,
David Travis, argued that the way
the defense funds are spent is dan-
gerous because'it could involve the
U.S. in a foreign war.

“The Pentagon has earmarked
$200 billion to be spent on nuclear
weapons for 1982. Fully two-thirds
of that money is not going to be
used for domestic defense, but will
be spent overseas on NATO, Japan
and West Germany,” Travis said.

Travis argued, that the U.S.
should curtail the foreign portion
of its nuclear defense spending and
use that money for domestic pur-
poses. This would allow the
government “to cut our taxes by a
considerable amount, which at this
point of all three levels of govern-

The whole idea is to make_pro-
ducts better with less emphasis on

cost, according to Ayres. He said,
“If we are going to start thinking
seriously about this then we’d bet-
ter start soon.”

Robotics is in its infancy, but
Japan is still leading in the field
with over 8,000 reprogrammable
robots in place, according to Ayres.

There are several reasons why

A merit are more than 45 percent of

Japan has the jump on the U.S.

Japan has put more emphasis on
mass production than the U.S.,
Ayres said. In addition, capital is
cheaper in Japan because their
interest rates are about half of ours.
Ayres also added that Japan ha_s
better labor-management
relations.

Ayres admitted that the move
towards robots would displace
much of the labor force, but he said
that he had no solution to the
problem.

“There is a role, however, for the
government to provide incentives
for industry to move towards repro-
grammable manipulators,” Ayres

said‘,_ “_biit not in the form of
subsidies.”

People are going to have to get
used to the fact that they are going
to have to go back to school several
times in their lives,” Ayres’said. He
added that he was in favor of the
idea of an educational fund that a
worker could draw from if his
plant were closing and he needed
money to go back to school and
learn something else.

the average person’s earnings. This
would bring about unprecedented
prosperity,” he said.

“We must have a strong domes-
tic defense,” Travis said. “The
important thing is that we must be
in a position to defend ourselves

against Russia should they ever
attack us.”

Travis also suggested that if we
cut off foreign military aid, the
countries receiving aid would have
to manufacture their own arms,
placing a greater burden on their
economies and making it impossi-
ble to do things like dump steel in

and a member of the Owl Hall
of Fame.

Rial, of Swarthmore, Pa.,
received his Bachelor of Science
degree in engineering in 1946
and earned his Doctor of Medi-
cine degree in 1950. At present
he is the president of the Ameri-
can Medical Association and a
family physician in private
practice. He was a basketball
manager, president of the medi-
cal inter-fraternity council, vice
president of his medical school
class and a member of the
Panther Foundation.

Robinson, of Pittsburgh is
the pastor at Bidwell United
Presbyterian Church on the
Northside. He earned his

In The Clear

While the rest of the nation is in the midst of
an educational crisis, Pitt is in the clear.

In American colleges, the quantity and qual-
ity of research and training in Soviet studies is
at its lowest point since World War II, accord-
ing to a recent article in The New York Times.
The situation is causing a lot of concern, and a
concentrated effort is being made to revive
American studies of the Soviet Union. Part of
this effort has taken the form of a large fund-
raising drive; so much importance is attached to
this issue because the lack will affect the area of
Russian policy studies.

According to the Times, nearly half of the
faculty who teach Russian studies in the U.S.
are expected to retire in the next decade, and
some universities do not plan to replace them.

If this trend continues, the U.S. will be
seriously deficient in its number of diplomats
and qualified state department recruits.

However, enrollment in Pitt’s department of
Russian and East European studies have
remained steady, according to assistant director
Bob Donnorummo. He said that there had been
a slight decline in the ’70s, but that the figure
has been increasing in the ’80s.

Although some other schools aren’t main-
taining their programs, Pitt has expressed its
committment to the study of the Soviet Union.

As far as the Russian language is concerned,
Pitt. has also experienced not only steady enroll-
ment but also a slight improvement in the qual-
'ty of students.

This is surprising, since Russian is taught in
only three local schools. At Pitt, a student’s
exposure to the language is often his first.

It’s admirable that Pitt has kept up its com-
mittment to the study of the Soviet Union, but
Pitt’s dedication does little to alleviate the shor-
tage of qualified people. The Soviet Union has
three times as many specialists on American
foreign policy as the U.S. has on Soviet policy.

At its gloomiest, this lack of insight into
Soviet affairs could lead to serious misunder-
standings of Soviet policies, motives and
perceptions—and mistakes have been made
when two parties didn’t understand each other.

We can feel comfortable with the situation at
Pitt, but changes must be made in high school
curricula. The way Russian language and cul-
ture are taught must be upgraded or, in some
cases, introduced. It should not be a case of “us
and them” as far asaeducation is concerned.

"By JENNIFER JOHNSON

“It astounds me that such a
column could be written by a
responsible member of The Pitt
News staff." This is how Jeffrey
Lockledge began his letter, which
appeared in The Pitt News Friday,
Sept. 24. I am responding to Jeff-
rey's letter in which he responds to
Christina Clinton’s article, which
appeared in The Pitt News Mon-
day, Sept. 20.

Christina, as a reporter of The
Pitt News, brought attention to an
occurrence, a Greek socialization,
that took place on Saturday, Sept.
ll. In this article, she explains how
she tried to get the whole scoop on
the big Saturday night commotion
at the Greek’s frat house. But then,
she states, how could she since
when she went to the horse’s
mouth, the Greeks, to get the news
they gave her the great silent treat-
ment. Then Christina, as a report-
er, questioned the mysteriousness
of this strange and unduly silence.
After all, what have the Greeks to
hide?

However, Jeffrey in this matter,
opposed Christina’s action. “The
fact that the two fraternities were
tight—lipped about this occu-
rence...should not be surprising.”
He claims that the Greeks were in
an embarrassing situation to even
discuss the matter. Then he argues

I would like to write a follow-up
letter to both the article by Diane
Lefkowitz and the editorial regard-
ing the A.C.R. system. I hope that
this letter will help clarify our com-
mittee’s position on this subject.

The basic problem appears to be
merely one of communication
between the housing office and the
resident students. Our committee is
not comprised of aggressive and
irrational students demanding
total compliance from the Univer-
sity Housing Office.

We are puzzled by the implemen-
tation of the A.C.R. system and
would like to have answers to these
basic questions:

0 When is the system goi.ng to
become policy?

0 Are we, the resident students.
at present required to use the sys-
tem when it is operable?

0 If we are required to use the

- system, is it also necessary to pres-

ent? If so. what is the function of
the A.C.R. system?

about their being well within their
so-called rights to give their silent
treatment.

What I want to know is: How
could they have been well within
their rights to keep “hush—hush"
about a campus event? In case you
didn’t know, Jeffrey, this event did
receive campus attention. There-
fore it was up to a Pitt News re-
porter, in this case, Christina Clin-
ton, to report it to us. In fact, I
figured that since the Greeks are
always in the classified section of
The Pitt News, I'd read notjust one

‘As I see it, the only threat to
them is the tight—lipped
Greeks.”

write up on them, but at least three
or four. So, Jeffrey, I too was quite
astounded.

Jeff, I do agree with you. Miss
Clinton is a responsible member of
The Pitt News staff. She was well
within her rights to bring this
event to our attention. That is her
job: that is her journalistic
freedom.

However, the Greeks’ choosing
not to discuss an event with The
Pitt News is another story. If they

be considered by the university
when the decision is made to either
implement or dispose of the
system?

We understand the necessity for a
continuing progressive form of

security within the dormitories,

 

and we applaud the uni\'ersity for
its efforts to maintain a functional
and modern method of security.
However‘. perhaps due to a lack of
information, many of the resident
students have serious reservations

Hush-Hush At Pitt

wish to keep.things “hush-hush”
between them and The Pitt News,
they should go “all the way"-no
classified ads and no columns.
Therefore, no embarrassment.

Clearly, Jeffrey is only thinking
of himself and the Greeks for some
odd reason or another. He seems to
forget just what Christina’s job is.
He also feigns authority, or shall I
say sympathy, by bringing the IFC
into the debate. He asks “How does
she think the IFC forced the frater-
nities involved to keep their
mouths shut? With double threats
of probation?” I just don’t under-
stand what that is supposed to
imply. And then the asinine
remark about hoping that “Miss
Clinton thinks over her comments
and doesn't bless us with further
editorials, such as ‘The IFC link to
the CIA.’ ” Is that meant to becom-
ical or what? Is it some kind of a
threat?
is the tight-lipped Greeks. For one
thing, they ‘will be watched more
closely not only by me, but also by
many others. They’ll take care not
to get into any more embarrassing
situations. I'm sure that they too
know that Christina Clinton will
take her responsibility to “scoop,
scare and astound” them, right off
with her next article without their
assistance. And that would truly be
their blessing. '

Another Look At Security

Many rumors concerning the
system's ability to monitor the stu-
dents’ comings and goings have
been circulated on campus. I
believe this is not a major issue at
present, and I am very relieved that
the university has not introduced
the system for that purpose.

Perhaps with an open flow of
information between the housing
office and the students rumors can
be dispelled and replaced with
accurate information.

Our committee is designed to
present the students’ opinions to
the housing office and the housing
office's ideas to the students.

At present, the A.C.R. system is
not liked by many of the students
because it does create confusion in
the lobbies.

Isincerly hope that this letter has
clarified any possible misunder-
standings regarding our attitude
towards the .\.(Z.R. program.

I look forward to representing
the students‘ attitude to the Hous-
ing ()ffice and working with them
to resolve this issue.

‘l=avoriteYear’: Invitation Only  

By TODD ERKEL

Some movies simply don't travel
well. Like the summer vacation foot-
age that yawned them at the bridge
club, ‘ My Favorite Year, a very
shmaltzy, very New York comedy,
seems intended only for those
involved.

This movie is a supposed docu-
comedy of television as it was in the
19505 and, although it has New York
critics drooling all over their home
keys, it drew only scant "ha; ha, ha's"
from at least one Pittsburgh
audience. What was that ol’ show biz
adage? "Will it play in Peoria?"

The selectivity of this movie
results not so much from the mate-
rial, but from its delivery. The
audience is made to feel as if they're
the only ones who don't know the
punchline while the movie goes on
having a blast. Considering the slop
passed off as comedy these days, it
might be that an intelligent, mature
attempt at humor such as My Favorite
Year is blindly accepted. It isn't a bad
movie; it just simply isn't that funny.
A nice excuse to reminisce about the
zany era of live television, yeah, but
contrary to PBS’ new Sneak Preview-
(ers), the only thing left rolling in the
aisles are popcorn buckets.

ally chronicles the "favorite week” of
Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker)
when he was but a freshman writer
on the staff of The Comedy Cavalcade

\(aka Your Show ofShows). Benjy Stone is

based on Mel Brooks who, at the age
of 20, was writing for YSOS.

What made that week so special
was an appearance on Cavalcade by
Alan Swann, a grandiose, Erol Flynn-
like movie star whom Benjy openly
awes. The gem of this brilliantly-cast
movie is Peter O'Toole in the role of
Swann. Fears that O'Toole and

comedy might make for rather
strange bed—fello'ws are quickly
erased and O'Toole electrifies his
every scene with his well, I believe
the scientific term for it is "presence."

The premise here is that Swann, a

I philandering old lush with a terrible

sense of puctuality and bad manners
to boot, cannot be trusted to pull off
this guest appearance, so Stone is
given the responsibility to shadow
him. Leading those who are fearing
the worst is Cavalcade's host, King
Kaiser, played with fitting absence of

Blue Collar Celebration

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

Working. If, like Al Capp's Li'l
Abner, your job is testing mattresses,
you probably look forward to your
day on the job. If not, you probably
don't.

Working is the title and the subject
of the City Theatre Company's pre-
miere production of the 1982-83 sea-
son, running from October 7
through 31. Co—directed by CTC
artistic director March Masterson
and Ken Gargaro, Woking is a musical
adaptation of Studs Terkel's b_est-
selling book by Stephen Schwartz
and Nina Faso. The music is the work
of, among others, James Taylor,
Micki Grant and Craig Carnelia.

Working is very much an ensemble
piece of theatre, and its fine profes-
sional cast includes core company

members Holly Thuma, Larry John
Meyers, John Hall and Lisa Tomp-
kins. New faces include Joan Ammon,
Norrice Raymaker, David Neal,
Wanda Daniels and Tom Spanedda.
As preparation for their roles, Work-
ing castmembers visited workplaces
ranging from firehouses to steel
mills. Several actors have actually
done the same jobs as the characters
they portray. »

In choosing a piece like Working,
artistic director .Masterson is
attempting to reach an audience that
normally does not attend the theatre.
The play is a celebration of American
working men and women who are
engaged, in Studs Terkel's words, "in
a search for daily meaning as well as
daily bread—for a sort of living,
rather thana Monday—to-Friday sort
of dying." Since Pittsburgh is so very

Filling out the ensemble of fine
actors are Bill Macy as the show's
head writer, Lainie Kazan as Benjy's
effervescent Jewish mother and
Selma Diamond as the gum-cracking
wardrobe mistress. E

Why then doesn't this movie work?
Richard Benjamin, making his direc-
torial debut here, has to take some of
the blame. As parody, My Favorite Year
timidly pokes fun, but never lunges
for the kill. A case in point is Bolog-
na’s Kaiser; whose egomaniacal
pander is diluted in worry over
Swann’s appearance instead of being
allowed to run its course.

Benjamin periodically turns his
actors right into the camera, and an
otherwise hilarious situation, when
Benjy brings Swann home to Brook-
lyn for dinner, is reduced to mono-
logue. If Benjamin would have
unbuttoned the collar on this one, My
Favorite Year could have been a reck-
less spoof packed full of hilarity.
Instead, he insists ‘upon plenty of

. detail, which, although it dresses up

the fringes of scenes, ultimately
slows the movie down to a too plea-
sant a pace.

The other hand in the pot here
belongs to Mel Brooks, whose name
appears nowhere in the credits but
who, according to Benjamin, was
"our godfather...our advisor." The
result is an overly personal view of a
funny show at a funny time in televi-
sion history. As a scrapbook to the
period, My Favorite Year is heartwarm-
ing, but as a comedy to be shared by
all, not everyone will get what's com-
ing them.

ROCK DREAMS
By Guy Peellaert and N ik Cohn
Rogner and Bernhard
Originally published in 1973,
Rock Dreams is an expansive col-
lection of drawings by Euro-
pean artist Guy Peellaert, with
captions by rock ’ writer Nik
Cohn. Noting one supposes
that rock and roll books are
making a dent in the book-
selling market, it has just been
reissued in hardback (the origi-
nal was the same large size, but
softback) by Rogner and Bernh-
ard. But therein lies the biggest
disappointment. This "new”
1982 edition contains exactly
the same pictures and captions

‘as the original released some

nine years ago—no updates and
no new music stars are
included, though as anyone
knows, there's a whole new
breed. of music out there and
new artists at the head. The
book is in chronological order,
beginning with people like
Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley,
Bill Haley, Fats Domino, Ioe
Turner, etc., and ending with
”newer” musical forces like Lou
Reed, David Bowie and Rod
Stewart.

But, regardless of the book's
failure to update its subject,
Rock Dreams is still an arrest-
ingly eclectic effort, which,
while the drawings are fantasy-
like in nature, conveys some
accurate insights into certain
rock stars’ lives and music. The
picture devoted to Ierry Lee
Lewis for example,
somewhat crude, depicts a
nymph dressed in a wedding
gown that's hitched high up her
thighs against a background
consisting of a large Jerry Lee
poster, a startling reference to
his marriage to his 13-year-old
cousin. Other highlights
include: a wonderful drawing
of Annette and Frankie lying on
a beach with Annette’s lips
pursed and her long, tanned
gams stretched out in front of
her; a hilarious one of Phil
Spector lying on a round, pink
bed reading J/ariefy with a huge
purple headset on and several
pages devoted to the Beatles
and the Rolling Stones, the lat-

though.

Dire Straits’

LOVE OVER GOLD
Dire Straits
Warner Bros.

Risks...they're not meant to
be taken in this music industry.
Especially not during a time
when record sales are at an all-

time low, and federal lawmak—'

ers are being pressured to ban
the home taping of albums. No,

this is’ a time to clutch at the

half-notes of musical tradi-
tion———even if it is banal—in
hopes that the ticker tapes and
financial statements will keep
coming up black.

Yet, this month of October
has seen the emergence of two
albums that take a risk and
succeed—both artistically and
integrity-wise—while shun-
ning the largely financial safety-
net of rock—n—roll Reaganomics.
The first and most obvious of
the two releases is Bruce
Springsteen's Nebraska, which
has already elicited hosannas
from the critics. The remaining
album is the prolific Love Over
Gold by Mark Knopfler and Dire
Straits which, though it may
not cause the hullabaloo that
Nebraska effected, nonetheless
vies blow for blow with the epic
qualities of Springsteen's
release.

A fitting follow-up to Making
Movies, Love Over Gold is asrvisual
as it is musical. Each one of
Knopfler’s songs is an aurally
cinematic fish-eye view of life
and love. Where Springsteen's
Nebraska is skeletal and bleak in
its impression of a harsh Ameri-
can heartland (and rightfully
so), Knopfler’s Love Over Gold is
rich in its imagery and personi-
fications of hard times and lost
love. The album contains only
five songs -with the shortest

 

    

"E NOPFLER OF DIRE 8'1 K

track being close to six minutes
and the longest track, "Tele—
graph Road," a marathon 14
minutes long. At this point,
Knopfler’s risk becomes
evident.

Nevertheless, each one of the
Dire Straits’ cuts is a featurette
in itself that smacks of cinema-
scope in sensurround. "Tele-
graph Road," the album's
masterpiece, is a musical rendi-
tion of The Grapes of Wrath with

Knopfler as Henry Fonda; "Pri— ’

vate Investigations" is Bogey in
The Big Sleep; "Industrial Dis-
ease," with its irresistibly tacky
farfisa sound, is Woody Allen's
version of China Syndrome; "LoVe
Over Gold" is any '40s tear-
jerker with Ingrid Bergman;
and the haunting "It Never
Rains" is Baby Doll with Carroll
Baker. R

Like Nebraska, a sense of deep
sadness permeates Love Over
Gold, but where Springsteen
used the cold stare of the pres-
ent to saturate the listener with
a sense of the funereal,
Knopfler relies on the still-

115

  

warm tendrils of nostalgia to
contrast with the iciness of
today and tugs at the heart-
strings of the listener, forcing
-him to long for the "good old
days." The effect is a journey
back to childhood fantasies and
dreams that have died along the
roadside. At one point in "Tele-
graph Road," Knopfler laments
over his lover: Well I'd sooner
forget, but I remember those nights-
/Life was just a bet on a race/Between
the lights/You had your head on my
shoulder and your hand in my hair-

, /Now you act a little colder, like you

don't seem to care." Ah, the maso-
chistic pleasure of memories
resurrected and dreams
reincarnated.

Adding to the fantasy is the
musical prowess of Dire Straits.
With Love Over Gold, the band has
been expanded to include guita-
rist Hal Lindes and keyboardist
Alan Clark, who accompanied
the original Straits on the Mak-
ing Movies tour. Although
drummer Pick Withers has left
the band, he stayed on long
enough to play on Love (rumor

Very few people can get away
with dressing hard-core punk
these days. Mohawks, funny
colored hair, metal chains and
over-sized black boots may have
been the"new" look in 1977, but
it is five years later (Strummer
& Co., take note), so anyone

owning these items should put -

'em in the attic or give them to
the Salvation Army. One of the
few people who still dresses this
way, but who can be forgiven, is
Billy Idol, and not because he
looks good in ripped T-shirts,
but because his music is good
enough to allow him such
fashion extravagance.

Billy Idol, his self—entitled solo
LP debut (he recorded several
albums with Generation X and
factions thereof and released a
four song EP, Don't Stop, last
year) contains all the sparks

we've come to expect from Idol -

in the past and then some.
There's the basic two guitarsl
bass/drums rock and roll sound
of "Come On, Come On " and
"Nobody's Business," the cas-
cading ”Hungry Heart"—ish

Latest Chapter

has it that ex—Rockpile
drummer Terry Williams has
been hired to fill his place).
Returning from the original
band is bassist John Illsley and,
of course, the amazing guitar of
Mr. Knopfler. As the rest of the
Strait-men lay down a magical
medium of rhythm, lingering
keyboards and backbeat,
Knopfler weaves and mingles
through the melody with that
unique finger—picking style. He
sings of sadness—a sadness that
flows from his Strat and wells
within the listener, forming a
lump in the throat. The emo-
tions are one with the music.
With the release of Love Over
Gold, Mark Knopfler once more
claims his; place as one of the
best songwriters of the era, and
Dire Straits remains to be one of
the most talented rock bands of
all time. Sure, the comparison is
drawn once more to Spring-
steen, but for the sake of dis-
tinction, Springsteen weaves
epic anthems, while Knopfler
imagines epic fables. Whatever
the claim, Love Over Gold is an
epic album. Without a doubt,
Homer is alive and well and
playing rock-n-roll.
FRANK DIGIACOMO

Adam and his Ants have been
since their first album), the
NOT generic syntho-beat of
"White Wedding" and even a
nice popsy-ballad called "It's So
Cruel." Idol wrote or co—wrote
everything here, and it's a nice
representation of his not-well-
publicized skills; with scant few
exceptions, most songwriters
can't hit a variety of targets as
well as Idol can.

While you might wish he'd
retire his clothes and discover
his true hair color, Billy Idol's
artistry can't be ignored, so buy
this and keep in mind that you
can always close your eyes and
turn up the sound the next time
he's on Solid Gold.

SPYS
Spys
EMI America

Spys, the latest band in the
power—pop genre, plays a
straight—ahead style rock that
puts many power—pop acts to
shame- The rawness is there,
but harmonizing keyboards and
guitars keep Spys from being just
another heavy metal album.

The members all hail from
New York City; featured are ex-
Foreigners Ed Gagliardi and Al
Greenwood. John Blanco and
John DiGaudio both played with
Harpy, a popular NYC group,
and Billy Milne rounds out the
lineup in fine style. All five are
very good musicians, which
leads to a great sound. Best cuts
include "Don't Run My Life,"
"Danger," "Don't Say Goodbye"
and "No Harm Done."

WDVE and Y104 listeners
will best appreciate this album
and band; this disc will leave
that audience clamoring for
more.

GET LOOSE
Evelyn King
RCA '

WILD NIGHT
One Way
MCA

The name Evelyn "Cham-
pagne" King fit the tirnefand
her song "Shame" fit the sound,
riding the crest of the disco
wave to the tune of over one
million in sales. Times and
sounds have changed. Evelyn
has dropped the "Champagne,"
and, although still relatively
successful, there haven't been
many million sellers in the past
five years.

Evelyn King's newest hit is
"Love Come Down" from her
album Get Loose; it's climbing the
various charts, but it ain't a
"Shame." Get Loose is a sweet
album full of sweet songs, but
it's not one that you'll rush
home to hear.

King's voice has a beautifully
lucid quality to it but after a
while, you yearn for a few
rough edges. "Back to Love" is
the only other standout on the
album, thanks mostly to the spel-
dom heard sound of a "real"
piano. King should tighten up
her material; too many of the
songs run over six minutes
long—a nice touch for funkier
numbers, but the mid-tempo
pieces wear thin at around the
three minute mark.

One Way's Wild Night suffers
from more serious problems;
the singers here can't sing and

THE rrxx

when your whole sound is built
upon the repetition of a few
syntho—chords, you'd better
have a vocal to lay over them or
you're just creating noise. This
is especially true when over half
of the album falls under the bal-
lad category—humans have
long danced to noise but just sit-
ting there and absorbing it isn't
quite as easy.

The only salvagable song on
this is the title track which
builds slowly then steps out
with a full sound of horns and a
driving bass. Best to get the 45
and save the dollars for some-
thing a little more exciting.

RCA

Anybody who has heard "You

knows the different sound that
sets Steel Breeze apart from the

. crowd. The keyboards featured

on this song, along with many
others on the album, make a
very pleasant change from the
usual fare, they are also
indescribable.’ -

Steel Breeze is the self-titled
debut album from this Bay-area
band. Like many other groups
from this domain, the potential
commercial appeal is immense.
"You Don't Want Me Anymore"
could easily be replaced on the
pop charts by "All I Ever Wanted
To Do," "Lost In The 80's" or
"Can't Stop This Feeling." The
music is moderate rock sound
and is addicting; one track
makes. you want to hear the
next.

If their debut is any indication
of what's to come, Steel Breeze
will be the newest darlings of
music directors and free-

THE HIGH AND THE
MIGHTY

Donnie Iris

MCA

C'mon, baby, grab your red
shoes and your wraparounds
and let's dance to Donnie. Don-
nie Iris, that is, and boy, that is
one rocker of a new album he
has out called The High And The
Mighty.

The great thing about Donnie
Iris is that he makes no pre-
tenses about his music; there's
no attempt at waxing philoso-

phical, no bullshit, just a univer-
sal message of live, love and
have a good time doing both of
them. It's because of this atti-i
tude that Iris' songs and music
are so much fun.

The High And The Mighty is no
exception. This album is pure
frat—party rock. Donnie is mean
with a power—pop hook and he
wields it with great flair on such
sonic wonders as the snare
drum lace.d anthem "The High
and The Mighty," the soulful
"This Time It Must Be Love,"
(which sounds like an O'Jays
tune), "Tough World," "Your
Gonna Miss Me " and even an
excellent cover of the Dave
Clark Five's "Glad All Over."
You won't stop dancing.

This album is like one of those
TV-compilation records that
has every great dance tune that
the sixties ever produced on it—
it's fun, it's fast and it's easy to
turn up real loud and dance to.
What's better is you don't have
to wait six weeks for delivery.
Buy it. NOW.

Interview

By GEORGE HOLZER

When Kansas rolled into Pitts-
burgh last month, they had a hectic
day planned. After spending an hour
at the Oakland Oasis Record Store,

_they were hustled down to the Civic

Arena for a four o'clock sound check.
Before‘ and during the sound check,
'MTV was doing an interview with
some of the members not needed on
stage. Somehow the band's road
manager, Dave, squeezed a little
extra out of the guys so that Kansas
could talk with SHOWCASE.

Rich Williams, lead guitarist, was
shuttled my way first. We broke the
ice by talking about the departure of
Steve Walsh. "Steve has left the band
a few times, about three; this has
been the longest. He's always had
frustrations being a writer and want-
ing to do a lot more of his own mate-
rial. So, he quit. He left the day
before we were due in the studio —
he took his songs and split. The chan-
ces of his returning are less than zero.

I When he left, we regrouped real
‘quick and carried on," he said.

From there, the conversation
turned to the road and touring, a
favorite experience of Rich's: "We've
been on tour for two months, but it's
slow. Not many sell-outs; we're only
getting three-fourths in the larger
halls. We're also playing smaller
venues; we did a 4000-seater some-
,where in New York. The tour also
included one outdoor show in a
?stadium." . 1 .1

Our final topic was the near-
future plans of the band; according to
Rich, Kansas is "moving onward; we

Robby Steinhardt, the violinist-

about‘ being back in Pittsburgh. "To

percent; they keep coming back. Like
I said, it's "great."

John Elefante, the new lead singer
(Steve Walsh's replacement) came in
next. The first question I began to
ask was interrupted by his laying
down thecondition that a copy of the
interview be sent to his mother.
After clearing that up, I asked him

how he came to sing for Kansas.

"There was a raffle at K-mart, I
entered, and I won. NO, really, a
friend heard that Steve Walsh left
the band, so I sent in a tape. The next
thing I know, they want me to do a
live audition; that went really well.
So, here I am," he said. A

I then asked John what he was

doing before Kansas. He replied, "I

was recording material, writing a lot _

and soliciting material to record
companies. The bands are nothing

"you've ever heard of, so I won't

even bother naming them."

This was followed by a discussion
on moving from a smallact to a
nationally-known band. John's
remarks were surprising, but well-

changes, John said, "Oh, definitely!
You go from living with momand dad

to Ho Jo's, Holiday Inns and Hiltons. _

Right now it is like a big vacation; I
haven't'had time for many of the

changes to sink in."

Responding to questions about the
difficulty of getting people to accept
him in the role Steve Walsh played
for so long, John commented, "The
people accept me; I think so, at least.
The diehard Steve Walsh fans don't
pay 12 dollars to see the new band.
The people who pay the money want
to be entertained by Kansas and our
music."

Did John try to change his writing
style to fit the style of Kansas? "I still
write John Elefante songs; after all,
they are Kansas songs now. As long
as Kerry (Livgren) "is in the band,
Kansas will retain its sound," he said.

After talking to John, Rich and
Robby (and meeting the rest of the
band), I discovered why Kansas is so
long-lived and popular. They work
hard, they get along with each other
quite well and they are considerate
of their fans and the people they
meet. These guys have earned the
right to "Carry On" in the world of
rock.

The Temple Owls have given the Panthers problems in the past.

pikers Face Severe Test

By MARK A. SINDLER

The Lady Panther volleyball
team has peered down the chute of
cataclysm fairly often this season.
Venture back to the Pitt Preview,
where a majority of inexperienced
players struggled to make a name
for the team.

These same players entered the

ienn State matches displaying a

érce countering force and quickly
displaced the perennial East cham-
pion Lady Lions.

Last weekend, coach Shelton
Collier was forced to field the team
with seven able-bodied players-—
six of whom were required on the
court at any onetime.

However, even considering
adverse conditions such as these,
the one knee-wrencher to top all
could come this weekend when Pitt

competes against seven other
schools in the Kent State
Invitational.

The Panthers will be going into
Ohio with a roster of nine players,
who will be used very sporadically.
There are six healthy players,
including seniors Diane Zack and

‘aptain Julie Gaul, whom Collier

would like to see play regularly.

“We are not going to pressure
ourselves to win any matches or
even the tournament,” he said.
“There will be a positive attitude
on the court, and we are going in
there to win and have fun."

Have fun? When one-third of the
team is out? Perhaps even humor
can be found in miserable situa-
tions. Collier plans to use different
people in various situations.

“We have established ourselves

‘ith wins over Penn State and our

overall record (24-3),” he said. For
this reason, this (invitational) will
not be a do-or-die situation. The
weekend will let us regroup, and
we'll even look at the tournament
with a light attitude.

“By going into thetournament

prepared for any losses which may
come our way. Don’t get me wrong.
We are not going there to lose—-
these players have pride—but we’ll
be relatively successful.”

Among a field including Eastern
Michigan, Chicago Circle, Wayne
State, DePaul and Kent State, Cin-
cinnati is coming off a relatively
successful year itself. As All-Metro
champion, the Bearcats qualified
for the NCAA’s.

Coach Kathy Kehoe takes a 5-2
team into the invitational as a first-
year coach. Yet, she says, this is the
most competitive and advanced
year yet.

“So far we have played some
good teams,” she said. “I feel like
we have lost some games that we
should not have, but it is a little
different lineup that may account
for this.”

Her different lineup means the
six returning starters are adjusting
to a different style of play, she
explained.

So why did the style of execution
change after a flourishing season?

“We chose to change it,” Kehoe
said. “At some point in the next
few years, we will be out of the
Metro and will have to be better
prepared for more advanced com-
petition.” Although Kehoe
boasts a team with “nice height
and offensive ability," the squad
has lacked consistency. The team
W111 enter matches “with strong
intensity” and play well for six or
seven points, but then start to slack
off, Kehoe said.

Cleveland State’s coach Mary
Motley is heading up a 19-7 squad
that, as she says, “is playing very
well.” We are being smart on
offense with the girls in the right
place at the right time and playing
the areas well."

This is Motley's first year with-
out a freshman-sophomore domi-
nated team, but one which is well
balanced. They also have the right

«In Kent State Tournament

“On offense,” Motley asserted,
“they are thinking on the court and
not thinking Cleveland State, but
thinking of the other team. They
are looking, thinking and talking.

“We are not letting the other
team play our game, but making
ourselves be the dominant team.”

Th_at’s not so bad considering
the university is only 14 years old,
and women’s sports there is seven
years younger. Kehoe maintained
that unlike schools with traditions
(Ohio State or Purdue), CSU has
not been around long enough to
gather a reputation.

Sizing up host Kent-State is as
difficult as evaluating the summer
weather in Hawaii. Not very taxing
on the mind. The Golden Flashes
are 4-24, so enough has.-been said
about that.

DePaul is riding a 4-12 slump,
but coach Jim Fitzgerald, in his
first full year, implied that it is
indicative of his complement of
players.

“I expected nine players return-
ing, but when five said that I would
require too much of them in prepa-
ration, they dropped from the pro-
gram. So there are four returning
sophomores who did not play as
freshmen.

“But they have the desire to play,
and besides, we have lost eight
matches so far by only two points,"
Fitzgerald said. “We've been in
them (matches) but cannot seem to
get over the hump.”

So, it will be the Kent State Invi-
tational. The classic will provide‘
an entire smorgasborg of talent,
teams and coaching philosophies.
More importantly. the weekend
opposition will put Pitt through
the wringer. It remains to be seen
whether the Lady Panthers will

J

Panthers Set To
Battle Ow|Trickery

By SCOTT DELLETT

The Pitt Panther football team
will attempt to regain lost ground
in the UPI and AP polls when it
faces Temple at Pitt Stadium
tomorrow afternoon. A

If the sellout homecoming
crowd expects an easy game, they
may be in for a surprise. Temple
has never been a pushover for the
Panthers.

In 1979, Pitt barely hung on fora
10-9 win. During the national
championship year of 1976, Pitt
only managed to score 21 points
against the stringy Owl defense.

Although the past two years have
seen relatively easy games—Pitt
defeated Temple 35-0 last year and
36-2 in l980——there is no guarantee
that the results will be the same
tomorrow.

The question of what's wrong
with Pitt’s offense remains unan-
swered. Temple’s defense is one of
its stronger points. The aggres-
sive defensive front is led by defen-
sive tackle Vinnie Mini,who led the
Owls with 48 tackles in eight
games last year. Guy Peters—-a four
year starter—plays opposite Mini.

Temple employs a 3-4 defense
and relies on stunts, blitzes and
pressure to upset its opponents.

These tasks fall into the hands of
linebackers Bob Balkunas and Rob
Moore. Both pursue the rush well.

The secondary is probably the
brightest point of the defense,,
which isn’t good news to Panther
quarterback Dan Marino.

Cornerbacks Kevin Ross and
Anthony Young have outstanding
quickness, which should help
cover Pitt’s corp of receivers.

The Owl offense is handled by
junior quarterback Tim Riordan,
who has completed 70 of 112
passes, which has been good for 806
yards and five touchdowns. More
importantly, he has only tossed
four interceptions in five games.

Split end Reggie Brown has been
Riordan’s favorite receiver. The 6-
0, 170 lb. senior has caught 20
passes for 253 yards. Fullback
Brian Slade is second in receptions
with 15, but his status is questiona-
ble due to an hyperextended knee.

The running attack. is led by tail-
back Harold Harmon, a 5-10, 190

Panther

lb. junior who leads all Owl
runners with 577 yards on 106
carries—an average of 96.2 yards
per game.

Harmon played in the first half
of Temple's rout over Louisville,
yet he gained'l06 yards that game.
Although he suffered a bruised heel
in the second quarter last Saturday,
Harmon should be able to play
tomorrow.

The kicking game is another
strong point for the Owls. Senior
Bob Clauser has hit on eight of
nine field goals in 1982, including
a 50-yarder against Louisville, the
longest in his career. The punting
chores are handled by junior Jim
Andrusko.

Perhaps the most important
aspect of the Owls is their coach,
Wayne Hardin. He always fields
teams that are well-disclipined and
coached, yet he isn’t afraid to use
some trickery to fool his opponent.

In his 13 years as Temple's
coach, Hardin has kept his team in
games it had no business staying
in.

The game tomorrow may be a
prime example. No doubt Hardin
will attempt to baffle the Panthers,
rather than match them talent-
wise. .

Will Pitt accept the bait or throw
it away? The answer may be the key
to Pitt’s return to the top spot in the
national rankings.

Panther Notes—-Greg Ganzer is
10th in punting, according to the
recent NCAA statistics. Bryan Tho-
mas is 23rd in receiving and Tim
Lewis is 14th in kickoff
returns....Split end Julius Dawkins
is now in sixth place on the Pitt
receiving list. He has 1,151 yards-
....Gordon Jones is the all-time
leader with 2,230 yards....Thomas
is averaging 4.64 yards every time
he carries or catches the ball....Th'e
defense has not given up a touch-
down through the air this year. Pitt
has allowed only two touchdowns
rushing....Ganzer’s average is .1 of
a yard off the Panther record held
by Larry Swider in l976....All of
Pitt’s opponents have only one
loss—-against the Panthers....The
last time Temple defeated Pitt was
in 1945. The score was 6-0.

Kick Around
Youngstown St.

By JIM COLLINS

For one of the first times this sea-
son, the Pitt Soccer team was able
to dominate an opponent. Youngs-
town State didn't provide much of
a challenge for the.Panthers, who
took a 4-0 win Wednesday night at
Pitt Stadium.

Both offense and defense
sparkled. The offense, led by Eric
Tiedtke, had -opportunities most of
the evening. The defense gave
Youngstown State few chances to
score.

Sparky Lucke started things off
in the first three minutes of the

rifled a shot on the oncoming
keeper_. The ball deflected off the
goalie to the foot of Lucke, who
put it in the topeninet. It was a case
of being in the right place at the
right time, and the Panthers were
up 1-0.

Pitt continued to control the
game due to the work up front by
Tiedtke and Lucke in creating
space for the midfield. Tiedtke
scored his first of two goals with 11
minutes remaining in the half.
Lucke passed the ball by the keeper
and Tiedtke kicked it home. At the
end of the half, Pitt held a 2-0 lead.

Tiedtke continued to dominate.

the offensive in the second half. He
seemed to move at will, confusing

Panther Offense Too

Much For Owl Defense

By SCOTT DELLETT

everyone now. A 14-5-3 record,
that’s pretty good for someone off
the street. Hi, boss, pretty good
record, eh?

What, you mean I've got to
improve? I’m the definition of
mediocrity. Besides, I even beat

‘ Professor Gridiron last week.

Yes, I know I had three ties. So
what? Okay, okay, I picked
Northwestern to lose last week-
they got lucky. All right, I won't
pick any more Canadian football
games, but they were fun and,
besides, they raised my average.

Oh no, not the dreaded paste-up
room. No, keep me away from the
headline machine! No, not the
wax. Help me, please!

Will our meek progosticator fig-
ure out a way to get out of the
waxer? Who cares? Anyway, here
are his picks...

O Pitt over 'l’emple—The
Panther may have to run up the
score this week or else they may be
out of the Top 10. Wayne Hardin
will have several tricks up his
sleeve—but not enough for an
upset. 38-10.

0 Penn State over Syracuse-
Pity the Orangemen. When Joe
Paterno gets swamped the week
before, the next opponent may
have to pray for forgiveness. 45-14.

0 West Virginia _over Virginia
Tech—The Mountaineers have a
legitimate football team. Virginia
Tech has a solid program, but it
won’t be enough. 30-17.

0 Baylor over Texas A 8c M—
Normally the Aggies would have
been the favorite but the world
would like to see Jackie Sherrill
lose another football game. 24-21.

0 Alabama over Tennessee—-—
The Crimson Tide showed last
week that they are one of the elite in
college football. The Volunteers
are years away from that plateau.
27-I7.

0 California over Oregon——-
There’s no reason for this pick,
except Oregon has been a loser for
the last 10 years, and California
started to slide with the departure
of Mike White, who is now at Illi-
nois. l4-I0.

0 North Carolina over North

Carolina State-—The Wolfpack has ‘

an outstanding secondary. The Tar
Heels have one of the best ground
games in the nation. Figure that
out, and you come up with a score

of 28-7. -

L Frostburg Wins Pitt Field Hockey Tournament

By TAMMY ANDERSON

Frostburg State College captured
first place in Pitt’s second annual
field hockey tournament this past
weekend. Frostburg compiled a
record of 3-0, with victories over
Ohio University, Slippery Rock
State College and Pitt.

Ohio U. took second place by
finishing 2-l, Pitt finished third.
with a record of 1-2 and Slippery
Rock placed fourth with a record of
0-3.

Coach Cindy Baldridge felt, “We
played well in each one of our
games. Our attitudes and skill level
keep improving as we progress
through the season. This improve-
ment in our play gives me strong
positive outlooks for our four
remaining games.”

The Lady Panthers greeted Ohio
Saturday in the opening game of
the tournament. Ohio jumped out
to a quick start by scoring the first
goal within the first 35 seconds of

' the game and minutes later, Ohio

scored again to boost the score to

2-0. The Lady Panthers answered
back when senior tri-captain Mar-
gie Hall knocked the ball past the
Ohio goalie to put the score at 2-1
at the end of the first half.

A strong offensive attack by Pitt
at the beginning of the second half
tied the game at 2-2 when sopho-
more Deb Madara blasted a shot
past the Ohio goalie. The Lady
Panthers lost control of the game
later and Ohio took over, scoring
three goals in the remaining min-
utes of the game to ensure the 5-2
victory over Pitt.

Baldridge said she felt that Pitt
may have been mentally unpre-
pared for the game against Ohio.

“Ohio U. was a strong team with
good stickwork,” she said. “I think
we were a bit surprised at how well
they could play, and, as a result, we
came up short. The 5-2 score was
no indication of the game, how-
ever, it was much closer than that.”

Sunday morning brought better
things for the Lady Panthers. After
a sluggish first half, down 1-0, the

Lady Panthers ignited for three
goals in the second half and
defeated Slippery Rock 3-l. Sopho-
mores Terry Zygarowicz and Phyl-
lis Kusuplos and freshman Joann
Patterson scored the three goals in
the Lady Panthers’ victory. The
victory put Pitt's record at 1-1 for
the tournament, while Slippery
Rock stood 0-2.

Baldridge believed that Pitt had

_returned to form in the game

against Slippery Rock.

“Everyone played a good game,”
she said. “We wanted the victory
over Slippery Rock badly because
they beat us earlier this season on
their field. Although the victory
was basically a team effort, I feel
Margie (Hall) and Lisa (Grass-
meyer)' stood out in the win.”

The Lady Panthers played their
final game of the tournament later
Sunday against Frostburg. At the
end of a regulation 70 minutes of
play, Pitt and Frostburg were tied
at 0-0. The game was still tied at the
end of the first overtime period, but

aurg managed to score two
quick goals in the second overtime
period to give itself a 2-0 victory
over Pitt and a 3-0 tournament
record which earned first place.
Baldridge said she felt that the
game with Frostburg was a very
evenly matched game.
“Frostburg’s style of play was
very similar to ours except that they
play a more physical game than we
do,” Baldridge said. “Frostburg
slowed the game down and took
away our momentum in overtime
because they were confident that
they would win if the game went
into a flickoff.” A _
-— Although there was no most val-
uable player award named for the
tournament, Baldridge said she felt
that one of her players, junior Amy
Dzwonczyk, played exceptionally
well throughout the tournament.
“Amy played good, consistent
defense and hustled throughout
the tournament,” Baldridge said.
“She had three excellent games this
weekend.”

Baldridge believes the tourna-
ment was very successful, and she
hopes to make some changes in
next year’s tournament. “In the
future, I would like to add two
more teams to the tournament and
include a winner’s and loser’s
bracket in the division of play,”
Baldridge said. “Also, I would like
to start selecting an all-star team
which would consist of those play-
ers who performed well through-
out the tournament.”

Baldridge said the tournament
has helped prepare the team for the
rest of the season. I V

“We have greatly improved our
confidence and attitudes by our
play this past weekend,” she said.
“We have tough games coming up’
against Davis and Elkins and
LaSalle, but I feel we will be able to
play» better in those games than we
have in the past because we are
improving daily. If we continue to
work hard at practice and keep our
team unity, I feel we will have a
great remaining season.”

BIRTH DEFECTS
FOUNDATION

 

By BRIAN BALK

After full back Marlon McIntyre
was sidelined with an ankle injury
during the West Virginia game
coach Foge Fazio was not hesitant
in calling junior Bill Beach from
the bench.

“They wouldn’t put you out on
the fieldunless they had faith in
you and thought you were ready,”
Beach said.

' Beach did not let his coach or the
fans down. In the 520 yards he
gained rushing and the crucial first
downs he earned, he proved that he
was indeed ready and ‘capable of
playing football.

A native of Findlay, Ohio, Beach
decided to come to Pitt to “get a
crack at a national champion-
ship.” However, he said that the
full meaning of “national cham-
pionship” did not hit him until he
got here.

Fullback is not a colorful
position—most of the time is spent
throwing blocks and opening
holes for tailbacks. Even without
the glory, Beach enjoys his
position.

“I like fullback because it
exposes me to a little bit of every
position,” he said.

Beach is a player who can geﬁto
where he has to be. “I run north to
south, not too flashy. Ijust try to
get where I want to go," he said.

While plugging for that new line
of scrimmage. Beach concentrates
on nothing—except getting a first
down.

“When I run, my mind’s almost
a blank—it just comes naturally. I
just try to do what it takes to get
there,” Beach said.

Without Beach’s blocking aid,
many of Bryan Thomas’ spectacu-
lar goal-line dashes would never
have come about. He said it is very
important to know where and
when to throw the block to permit
tail back penetration.

Beach,‘ who stands at 6-1 and
weighs in at 215 lbs., said there is
little truth to the belief that lifting
weights will reduce running speed.

“Our coaches harp on lifting
with your legs to‘ increase your
speed," Beach‘ said. “It really
wouldn’t matter, because whenever
we’re lifting weiare also running
just as much.”

Although Beach has to curtail
some of the meanest and most

‘aggressive of the opponent's drives,

he feels that he has an edge.

“We (the offense) have an advan-
tage because we know where the

play is going," Beach said‘.

Does
fullback?

“How can you be scared when
you go up against a defense like
ours daily at practice?” he asked.

anything frighten this

Even the thought of losing has
little effect on Beach.

“You can never really feel fright-
ened of losing a game. If you do,
then you don’t have faith in your
ability," he said. “Look what hap-
pened at the West Virginia game.”

Since Beach is a major compo-
nent of both the passing and run?
ning attacks, he knows that it is
important to establish both.

“We try to blend both the run-
ning and passing games together-
we try to make them complement
each other,” he said.’ '

The fPanthers will have to be in
good form against Temple. Beach,
said, Temple is “a sound team with
a strong defense.

“Temple is a moody team. On
any given da\. they can play like
bears or they can play like fish. But
they definitely have the ability to be
a tough team."

times,” Bemis said. “We can't
expect to play like this and win
against a very talented team.”

The Panthers‘ next game is
against Edinboro on Saturday,
Oct. l6. Edinboro plays a quick
game, relying mostly on hustle.
Because Edinboro always plays
tough at home, Bemis expects his
team to work on a more controlled,
give and go type of game. If the
Panthers play a more controlled
game, they, should continue with
the same success they had against
Youngstown State.
