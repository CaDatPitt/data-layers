SUPER BOWL

Ravens
win Super
Bowl XLVII

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Following a half-hour power outage
that disrupted the Super Bowl, the
San Francisco 49ers surged to erase
a 22-point deﬁcit before falling just
short; to the Baltimore Ravens, 34-31.

The Ravens’ advantage would
prove large enough to withstand a
furious comeback effort by San Fran-
cisco and to win Super Bowl XLVII
at the Superdome in New Orleans.

Sunday night’s victory is the Ra—
vens’ second Super Bowl title. They
defeated the New York Giants in the
2000 season. It will also give the
Ravens head coach,_]ohn Harbaugh,
boasting rights over his younger
brother, Jim Harbaugh, the 49ers’
head coach. 2 .

A 13-yard pass from Super Bowl
MVPJoe Flacco down the middle to
Anquan Boldin opened scoring for
the Ravens. And there was alot more
to follow.

A quarter later, the Ravens
knocked the ball loose from rookie
running back LaMichael James at

their own 25 and then drove 74 yards A

down to the one, where Flacco found
tight end Dennis Pitta for the score.

On the subsequent possession,
a turnover would again cut the San

Francisco drive to an abrupt end .

when Colin Kaepernick ﬁred high
over his target receiver and into the
awaiting hands of Baltimore’s Ed
Reed.

Lining up 32 yards out, rookie

 L kicker Justin Tucker took the snap

  Corbett

proposes
flat

funding

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

For the ﬁrst time in three years,
Gov. Tom Corbett announced days
before his budget address that he
intends to propose level funding
for state and state-related univer-
sities.

Corbett will unveil his entire
2013-2014 budget, which he said

will include $1.58 billion in fund-..

ing for higher education, to the
Pennsylvania General Assembly
on Feb. 5.

State—related universities in-

clude Pitt, Penn State University, _

Temple University and Lincoln
University. Unlike the schools in
Pennsylvania’s State System of
Higher Education, these univer-
sities operate independently and
receive only partial funding from
the state. Last year, the state ap-
propriated $136 million for Pitt.

Corbett said the decision to re-
ceive ﬂat funding this year comes
from Pitt, Penn State and Temple
agreeing that they will work to
keep tuition “as low as they pos-
sibly can,” which means agreeing
to limit any tuition increase this
year to the consumer price index.

“I think both sides understand
that a young man’s or young wom-
an’s future should not begin with
a mountain of debt,” the governor
said.

The governor’s proposal was in
line with recommendations made

p Correction: In Friday’s article, “ROTC weighs in on coed front lines,” Violet Lawson was described as going into the Air Force, but she is going into the Army and is in the Pitt’s
Army ROTC. She was also misquoted twice. She said, “If a guy wants to hold the door for me, I’m ﬁne with that,” not “If a guy wants to hold the door with me, I’m ﬁne with that.”
And she said, “We all bleed the same color — red white and blue,” not “We all believe the same color —— red, white and blue.” The Pitt News regrets the errors.

 

Sigma Chi fort-building event collects blank f e

Elizabeth Fiurigai
For The Pitt News

The Belleﬁeld gym was abuzz with
excitement Saturday afternoon as
members of 11 Pitt sororities expe-
rienced nostalgia for their child-
hoods in a fort-building event to
support Wrap Up America.

The Sigma Chi fraternity broth-
ers teamed up with Pitt sororities to
bring Wrap Up America, a charity
that collects blankets for the home-
less, to campus for the third annual
Wrap Up America blanket drive.

The two—hour event, which in-
volved much of Pitt’s Greek Life,
took place Saturday afternoon in
the Belleﬁeld Hall gym. The fra-
ternity collected 2,482 blankets for

donation to the Salvation Armyis

' Project Bundle-Up for distribution.

Wrap Up America is a growing
nonproﬁt organization established
in Louisville, Ky., that partners

with college campuses around the

country to bring its fort—building
event and blanket drive to support
members of the community in need.
Wrap Up America’s website states
that the organization “is formulated
around two core beliefs, charity
should be fun and easy.”
According to the organization’s
website, Wrap Up America had its
humble beginnings with a box.
Harlan Joelson, father of Wrap
Up America’s current president
Trevorjoelson, was working on his
grandfather’s mayoral campaign in

downtown Toledo, Ohio, when he
parked in front of a cardboard box
to hang up a campaign sign without
a secondthought. A man jumped
out of the box and asked, “Hey man,
why are you parking in front of my
house?”

Harlan apologized and moved
his car, but the ﬁrst step in this
movement came later that day when
he went to a store and purchased a
blanket to give to that man. Harlan’s
story continues to inspire Wrap Up
America in its mission to eradicate
homelessness.

“We chose this eventbecause the
founder is an alumni of the Sigma
Chi chapter at Louisville. And it’s
a great event for us. The sororities
love it, and the blankets have an im-

mediate impact. It’s fun fort build-
ing and at the same time having abit
of competition,” said junior Andrew
Hansen, Sigma Chi’s representative
for the Wrap Up America event.

Last year Sigma Chi collected
2,290 blankets, more than dou-
bling its ﬁrst-year total of 1,100,
which set a record for most blankets
ever collected in a single Wrap Up
America event.

But this year the fraternity sur-
passed its own record with 2,482
blankets, going above and beyond
its goal of 1,500 blankets.

The blankets are acquired both
through online donations, which
are then used to buy and order blan— ._
kets in bulk, and through collec-
tions of gently used or brand—new

blankets taken by the Greek Life
members. ,

At the competition, participants
used blankets and PVC pipe to con-
struct a myriad of fort designs. The
creations are less like forts and
more like full—size blanket houses
complete with roofs, multiple peak
architecture and furniture.

Contestants darted back and
forth, even out to the lobby to grab
chairs and tables to add to their
forts. Some sororities chose to use
their Greek colors for the design
and others just chose various mul-
ticolored hues.

Freshman Alyssa Campisi and her friends did
not know what to expect as they arrived at the
Petersen Events Center on Friday at 5 p.m. —
19 hours before the Pitt men’s basketball game
against Syracuse was scheduled to begin.

They weren’t even the ﬁrst ones in line.

“I feel like I’m at a premiere for a Harry
Potter movie  only this is so much bigger,”
Campisi said.

In preparation for the nationally televised
matchup, Campisi and numerous other Pitt
students packed the Petersen Events Center
lobby Friday night, looking to get a good seat
in the Oakland Zoo for Saturday’s game against
the sixth-ranked Orange. The game began at
12 p.m. Saturday, and the Panthers won 65-55.

The atmosphere leading up to Pitt’s game at
home against a top—10 ranked team impressed
even some of the Oakland Zoo’s eldest members.

“It’s crazy. The earliest people arrived at
noon and were prepared to camp out the whole
night to get a good spot in the Zoo,” Oakland
Zoo president and seniorjoe Lassi said. “I think
it’s just a testament to the school and the pride
around our team.”

The lobby of the Petersen Events Center
remained raucous throughout the night, with
chants of “Let’s go Pitt!” breaking out randomly
and many students j oining in to sing Old Crow
Medicine Show’s song “Wagon Wheel.”

Some of those belonging to the earlier ar-
rivals were well-prepared to wait out the long
haul. Several went as far as to bring blow-up
couches, mattresses and TVs that they hooked’
up to Xbox and PS3 game consoles.

Freshman Ryan Foley, who was among those
who set up an elaborate camp, had a lot to say
for the Zoo and his willingness to wait.

“I have been to nearly every game in the Zoo
so far this season,” Foley said, “And this is the
biggest one yet. I am a hugely faithﬁil Pitt fan
and would love to see nothing more than for
Pitt to beat ‘Cuse.”

Pitt men’s basketball head coachjamie Dix-
on even made an appearance around 7 p.m.
to show his support for the Oakland Zoo by
bringing pizzas to the hungry crew.

“It’s really great to be here now,” freshman
Ryan Rigau said‘. “I can feel the energy of the
Zoo just sitting here. This is going to be a great
game, and a great chance to move up in the
Big East.

A tent was pitched inside the Pete for sev-
eral hours until it was taken down by security.
Students played card games, watched TV and
movies on their laptops and brought outdoor
sports such as cornhole to help pass the time
while waiting in line. '

“This is without a doubt the hypest game of
the year for any Pitt student to be at,” freshman
microbiology majorJ.]. Lapin said. “This is one
of the most elite and highly ranked teams on our
schedule, as well as a Big East rival. It doesn’t

get any bigger than this for the Zoo.”

Lapin intended to arrive around 10 p.m. but
arrived around 8:45 p.m. instead after he saw
many students had already left for the game.
Similarly, Campisi and her friends intended
to arrive around 12 a.m. but ended up arriving
seven hours earlier.

When asked about the possibility of getting
sleep that evening, Lassi chuckled and replied,
“Well, I’m hoping to. However, I’m thinking
there isn’t even a possibility at this point.”

The Oakland Zoo board members took good
care of those waiting in line, purchasing piz-
zas and refreshments for the die—hard fans at
about 11 p.m.

Most students tried to sleep by the time 2
a.m. rolled around, which quieted the previ-
ously chaotic lobby.

With students continually pouring in
throughout the night, by 8 a.m. theywere asked
to condense the line so no one had to wait out-
side. Around 9 a.m. students were ﬁnally al-
lowed to enter the arena and take their seats.
With free “Game Day” T—shirts and headbands
in hand, masses of Zoo members entered the
arena at full sprints in an attempt to get good
seats.

_ As Pitt players ran onto the court, they were »
met with a shriek of cheers from the Oakland

Zoo. As Syracuse players ran out, they received
a steady “boo” from the crowd.

Throughout the game, the Zoo jumped and
shouted until the last play, despite having been

In a press conference after the game, Dixon
said he and his players appreciated the efforts
of Pitt’s student section.

“The Zoo has been unbelievable — it just
keeps getting bigger and better. We are thankful
forthe supportthey have been giving allthe way
through,” he said. I

ma sorority, commented on the way in which
the event is a great way to bring the sororities
and fraternities within Greek Life together on
behalf of a particular cause.

“I think our sorority gets excited to par-
ticipate. It is for a great cause, and it’s nice
to support other organizations within Greek
Life, ’cause we are actually the same team
within Greek Life,” Bromley said.

The sororities competed for an engraved
trophy and a $150 prize along with various
awards, including most unique design, most
structurally sound and most livable.

The overall winner comes from a combi-

 

nation of criteria: most sorority members
participating, best fort and most blankets
collected. The winning sorority takes home
an engraved trophy that stays in the chapter’s
house for the year.

Junior Shannon Casey competed in the
event with other Gamma Sigma Sigma sisters
who collectively won the event and brought
home the trophy.

“I think it’s a really good event [because]
obviously you get a ton of blankets out of
it, and they go to a homeless shelter, and
it brings a lot of organizations on campus
together,” she said. This was her second year
participating.

Laura McCanney, a sophomore major-
ing in ﬁnance and a member of the Tri Delta
sorority, agreed that this event brings to-

gether many different organizations for a
good cause.

“I think it’s really good because it brings a
lot of different organizations together to do
good charity for the Pittsburgh area, and it’s
really good philanthropy,” she said.

Hansen shared his future plans for the
event. Although he thinks the blanket drive

' has been a great success, he hopes to take

collections even further with a wide variety
of items to work toward further decreasing
homelessness.

“I hope we can not only partner with the
Salvation Army but with the food bank to col-
lect food and books to help homelessness as
well. I’d like to see [the charity event] address
all areas of homelessness, not just the need
for blankets,” he said. I

Gov.Tom Corbett proposed flat funding for
higher education. Kenny Ong |Visual Editor

by the Governor’s Advisory Commission on
Postsecondary Education made in Novem-
ber, according to a press release. Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg is a member of the
commission.

“This agreement will allow our schools
to better plan their budgets for the com-
ing year and make the best use of their
resources,”.Corbett said.

In recent years, Corbett used the op-
portunity of his pre-budget address press
conference on higher education to an-
nounce large proposed cuts. Last year the
University community fought against a
proposed 30 percent cut to Pitt’s appropria-
tions to eventually receive full funding. In
2011, Corbett proposed a 50 percent cut to
Pitt’s state funding, and the state ending up
cutting 19 percent of Pitt’s budget.

As previously reported in The Pitt News,
Pitt’s Board of Trustees approved a 3 per-
cent tuition increase for the 2012-2013
academic year.

Corbett added that a similar agreement
made last year between the state and uni-
versities resulted in the lowest increases in
tuition for state and state—related universi-
ties in more than a decade. I

THE STAMATTACK

OPINIONS

 

Sustainability and Chuck Hagel have
nothing in common except this column

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opinions Editor

Sustainability is a great thing. In the
long run, we need our systems to be
sustainable; otherwise they will, by
deﬁnition, have to end someday.
That’s why you won’t ﬁnd a big-
ger champion of true sustainability
than this guy. Unless we want (even

, more) mass extinction, civic unrest

or human misery, we need to develop
processes that arettulyeconomically,
socially and environmentally sustain-
able. 7 ’
Recyclemania seems like a good

program to help us achieve these sus-

tainable goals. Every year ﬁ'om Feb-
ruary to March the Pitt community
comes together and becomes manic
for recycling, militantly diving into
garbage to ﬁnd that one improperly
disposed polyethylene terephthal-
ate bottle to help Pitt become No. 1
in the nation for recycling — or at
least 94th. '

Butas manic as I getfor recycling,
I can’t help but be saddened by last
week’s report in the University Times
thatall ofmy enthusiasmforrecycling
is no match for clever accounting.

In orderto help increase Pitt’s per-
person recycling total from about 12
pounds per person to the new goal of
12.5’ pounds per person, collections
from the Petersen Events Center and
the University Club — which previ-
ously had not been included because
they aren’t managed by Facilities
Management — will now be included

-inthe total. ‘

So all the work I have been do-
ing, bringing weak-kneed recyclers
to justice, writing pro—recycling raps
(You won’t be a weenie, just recycle
polypropylene—ie) has been for noth-
ing because now we’re just going to
count the recycling we’ve been doing
anyway. When Pitt magically outper-

V forms itselfagain for Recyclemania,

it won’t be because we actually got
better at recycling.

Itwillbe because we’re just better
at counting.

This, of course, brings me to the

close of this column, in which I will i

say I really do believe sustainability
is important. But way too often, sus-
tainability programs are just exercises
in PR and clever counting methods.
Things such as offsetting carbon
dioxide production by supporting
tree plantings that would happen
anyway or re-estimating the num-
ber of people who walk to a building
to increase the percentage of people
using alternative transportation just
further — and rightﬁilly -— erodes
public "trust in the green movement.

Recyclemania is no better.

Speaking of having little trust in
a group of people...I wish crazy Re-
publicans would go away.

As a conservative, nothing makes
me more ashamed than Republican
congressional hearings.

Atbest tone deaf(all-male panels
on contraception) and at worst fright-
ening (the Ted Stevens’ Intemet-is-
a-series-of-tubes speech from the
mid-2000s), these lovely displays of
crazy paranoia leave me never more

convinced that Democrats will re-
main in control of the Senate.

This brings us to last week’s con-
ﬁrmation hearing of Chuck Hagel for
Secretary ofDefense. Hagel, aformer
Republican senator from Nebraska,
has been accused by some right-
winged individuals of being anti-
Israel and too soft on Iran.

The source of these sentiments
comes from Hagel’s statements
throughout his years of service,
most notably a 2006 interview dur-
ing which he said that the “political
reality” ofwashington was that “the

Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of peo-
ple up here.”

These opinions and beliefs war-
rant inquiry. Hagel would constitute
a signiﬁcant shift in policy. Ifthe Pen-
tagon is going tobe run by a person
less sympathetic to Israel, it’s fair to
bring these questions into the pub-
lic discourse. It doesn’t need to be a
witch hunt.

But when every Obama appoint-
ment is met with an instinctive, vis-
ceral disdain from the Senate, it’s
impossible to discern grandstand-
ing idiocy with reasonable questions.
Everything does seem to be a witch
hunt. Hagel just joins a long line of
people like Susan Rice,gElena Kagan
and Cass Sunstein who are turning
America into apuddle ofweak—willed,
European socialist traitors.

It’s a shame because a conversa-
tion about Hagel without the crazy
factor might have opened up an hon-
est discussion about Israel policy. I

G LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

This letter is in response tothe column “President’s inaugural speech ...” published onjan. 28. This column does

a good job of challenging the claim that we can simply “act in our time”

is probably more of adishonest notion-than anything else.

and presents some good detail on why 

As something of a tangential angle, I think there is a more serious concern with the way phrases like “social

justice” .and “do what works” are used; namely, those phrases smuggle in certain premises that hinder debate. Ifa

’ politicianisays we should just “do what works,” what they really mean is that we shouldldo what they want to do; and

if we disagree about what counts as working, we should sit in the comer and be quiet. If someone refers to “social
justice,” we should ‘ask ourselves what they actually mean. For instance, whether they are an objectivist or a 
or a catholic, etc-., will have a non-trivial effect on that person’s conception of ‘social justice,’ and, if we want to have
debates, we must acknowledge that. .

_ ‘ Ifwe want to have honest political discourse, we need to start by not hidingfrom the philosophical differences 
exist. Debatesovler policy are inherently debates about what we should be trying to accomplish, and burying those
questions (under labels like “what works” and “justice” has, in my opinion, only served to make political discourse

into the artof talking past each other. ' f l I

Free-throw shooting a problem for

Sophomore Brianna Kiesel and the Panthers couldn’t find an answer for the Balls of South Florida. Andy

With 1:23 remaining in the game,
sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel
crouched at the free-throw line,
rested her hands on her knees and
dropped her head in frustration.
The Panthers were trailing 77-59 to
South Florida, and

“If you look at the stats, the
thing that jumps out at me — and
I thought we were so frustrated —
was our free throws,” Berenato said
following the game. “If we make our
free throws, then we’re not trailing
the whole game. If we make our free
throws, then we’re in the driver’s
seat.

nior guard Andrell Smith quickly
thwarted momentum though, and
Kiesel’s 3—pointer on the next Pitt
possession would mark the ﬁnal
lead of the day.

South Florida’s prominent of-
fense held a size and speed advan-
tage over Pitt.

Tray Woodall (Pitt): 13 points, 3-for-7 shooting

R.J. Sepich
Sports Editor

Wmners expect to win.

When the Pitt men’s basketball
team knocked oifNo. 6 Syracuse by a
score of 65-55 Saturday afternoon, it
certainly didn’t come as a surprise to
the Panthers or to their fans.

Although many studentfan bases
around the country have made a habit
of rushing the court after victories
against highly ranked opponents,
Pitt’s rowdy Oakland Zoo student
section refrained from following
the home team’s triumph over the
top-10 Orange.

The Zoo expected its Panthers
to win after many of its members
began lining up Friday afternoon in
the Petersen Events Center lobby,
listening to music and playing video
games to pass the time during the
overnight slumber party in anticipa-
tion of Pitt’s biggest home game of
the season. Pitt entered the matchup
with Syracuse holding a 9-3 record
against the Orange during Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon’s tenure and an
11-1 record against top-10 teams at
home under Dixon.

After the game, Dixon and his
players seemed pleased not only
with their victory, but also with the
lack of post-game stampede on the
Pete court.

Seniorpoint guard Tray Woodall
said knowing your fans expect suc-
cess is something that motivates the
Panthers to perform well at home.

“We’re all happy to be a part of
this community,” he said. “We were
ecstatic last night knowing the fans
were sleeping in the gym. A lot of our
guys probably wanted to sleep with

them. When we see them ready to
go, we have no choice but to get up
for games like this.”

His teammates all nodded and
smiled astheir senior leaderthanked
the Zoo and the entire Pitt fan base.

Wmners play as a team.

Using a 10—man rotation, Pitt

wore down Syracuse’s seven players.  .

Until the very last minute of the
game, during which Woodall con-
verted several free throws, not a
single Panther had reached double-
ﬁgure scoring. To beat atop—1O team
without any one player taking over
offensively is truly incredible, but
that’s what Pitt has done this season.

“This team is unique,” Dixon said.
“Our strength is in playing 10 guys.
It’s not normal, but it’s what’s best for
us. It’s why we’ve improved so much
and gotten so much better.”

This wasn’t a new phenomenon.
No Panther averages more than 12
points per game, yet not one averages ‘
fewer than four.

In a sports era in which individu-
als steal the limelight, Pitt still re-
quires a total team effort to squeeze
out tight victories.

Wmners close out games.

Coming down the stretch ofback—
and—forth contests, teams often need
a go—to scorer to take over and put up

points in order to pull out the game. ' ‘*

That isn’t the case with the Pan-
thers —~ they just need guys who can
make free throws.

After losing games against Mar-
quette and Louisville because of hor-
rendous foul shooting, it appeared __
the issue might come back to bite the
Panthers yet again after they missed

“We always talk about the strength of our _

team is in numbers,” Woodall said. “We got

al, but I think it’s what
’ Dixon said. “It’s taken
some time to develop, but that’s where it’s
at, and that’s why we’ve improved so much.”

For Dixon, this is the kind of win that

   

pertains to what he’s harped on the entire-

season: defense and rebounding. Pitt held
Syracuse to only 18 made ﬁeld goals at a

36.7 percent mark from the ﬁeld and out— A

rebounded the Orange 39-24. ‘

Entering the game, Syracuse ranked in «

the top 10 among all Division I college bas-
ketball teams in rebounding with over 42
rebounds per game as a unit. Because of the
Orange’s rebounding acumen, Dixon made
it a point to challenge his players to get on
the boards.

“We did a great job on the glass, and that’s
what we wanted to do,” Dixon said. “I told
our guys that, a couple days ago, we had to
out-rebound them by 10." Yesterday, I told
them we had to out-rebound them by 15, and
they got to 15. It says a lot about our team.”

On Saturday, Pitt controlled the glass
under the direction of Talib Zanna, whose
six offensive rebounds and six defensive
rebounds constituted a game—high total of
12. Steven Adams ﬁnished with seven re-
bounds himself to comprise the bulk of Pitt’s
rebounding effort.

In the mind of Syracuse head coach Jim
Boeheim, rebounding itself was ‘the story

in how the game was won, especially in the
second half, in which Pitt held Syracuse to
only nine rebounds while ripping down 23.

On the defensive end, Pitt played nearly
impenetrable. defense against Syracuse,
whose guards Michael Carter—Williams
and Brandon Triche rank among some of
the nation’s best. Carter—Williams shot only
3-12 from the ﬁeld for 13 points, and Triche
ﬁnished 4-14 for 14 points. __ '

A testament to Pitt’s team defense Satur-
day was the way in which’P_itt limited Syra-
cuse’s ball movement,’fo__rcing individual
Syracuse players to created shots for them-
selves and make them. Syracuse finished
with only ﬁve assists on 18 made‘baskets..

Freshman  guard—‘Carter—Williams,
who entered fhle Pete leacl‘ii%§3’:2,tf.x-he nation
in assists/with an 8.9 ave‘rage,"registered
a season-low two assists with three turn-
overs. Pitt also forced Triche, normally a
low-turnover playeiﬁginto six turnovers and
limited him to onlyjjne assist. I .,

‘‘[Pitt] is a tremendous defensive team.

3

 knew we d have trouble scoring.ﬁagain_st

them,” Boeheim said. “I saw them play.'i.a

‘wlﬁ1e'back and thought they’d beleading
the league right now.” 5
Offensively, the Orange’s only bright spot

. was C.]. Fair, who scored 20 points to keep

Syracuse in the contest until the closing min-

utes of the second half when Pitt pulled away. -

Fair shot 9-12 from the ﬁeld, but with the

losses of key bench players Boeheim faced, A

Fair was forced to ‘play 40 minutes along
withjerami Grant. 4
A With the win Saturday, Pitt could have not
so much of a “turning point” in its season
but more of a “launching point” as March
looms only one month away. As of now, Pitt
seems to be in good shape to make a run:
The Panthers seemingly improve with each
passing game, and in the eyes of Boeheim,
the team is looking good. Pitt will be looking
to keep up the momentum this Monday at 9
p.m. at the Petersen Events Center, where the
Panthers will take on Seton Hall University.

“Pitt is the best team we’ve played all year,
by far,” Boeheim said. I .

down marked nine yards away only to
be stopped inches before, pushed out of
bounds and forced to forfeit possession.
It was the first fake field goal in Super
Bowl history.

But the 49ers couldn’t take advantage
of the defense’s performance and quickly
returned the ball to Baltimore.

Flacco stepped up to evade pressure and
heaved the ball downﬁeld to astreaking,
wide-openjacobyjones, who somersaulted
— his knee not touching the ground — and
got up to maneuver his way past the final
defender. It was a 56-yard connection.

David Akers, the veteran kicker who
missed a ﬁeld goal two weeks ago against
Atlanta, was not the,source of any worry

this game,r..a's hej converted each ofhis
three ﬁeld—goal attempts. Pitt alum and
San Francisco punter Andy Lee continued

« the high level of performance he has dem-

onstrated all season, averaging 53 yards
per kick. 1
On the first play of the second half,

Jones’ speed would change the game again.

He caught the kickoff and sprinted 108
yards practically untouched to the opposite
end zone. His second touchdown.of the
night fell-just short of the all—time record
for longest play in league history with 109
yards and was his third kick return touch-
down this season, all of which have been
for more than 105 yards. .

At 22 points, the lead was the largest
the Ravens would hold all night. And they
appeared to have all of the momentum.

cuse.
Thenwith aboutfour minutes remaining and

_ A Pitt up by ﬁve, freshman center Steven Adams

was fouled while attacking the rim but left the
game because of a swollen eye.

Syracuse head coachjim Boeheim had the
choice of which Panther on the ﬂoor would
shoot the two crucial free throws. He chose
redshirt sophomore guard Cameron Wright,
who was previously 0-for-4 from the foul line

' in conference play.

With the pressure on him, Wright stepped
up and conﬁdently drained both shots. The
Panthers paced the remainder of the game,
going 9—for-13 from the free—throw line in the
game’s ﬁnal minutes to hold off the 0range’s
fruitless comeback attempt.

“We’ve lost a number of close games, but
you can’t panic,” Dixon said. “[Shooting free
throws] is a constant battle.”

Ifthe Panthers start hitting more of those
crunch—time free throws and converting more

open shots, the potential for this team is in- A

credible.

The conﬁdence and depth Pitt boasts can’t
be found in many teams in college basketball.

And while excited about the victory, Dixon
summed up his team’s emotions after the game
in one sentence. I

“I think every game is a must—win game,” he
said, emphasizing Pitt’s expect—to —win attitude.

On this Saturday afternoon, Pitt and its fans
provedlthat despite last season’s struggles and
this year’s ups and downs, the Panthers’ men’s
basketball program is ﬁill of winners. I

V Andrell Smith and her twin sister, guard
Andrea Smith, paced a quick offense that was
tough for the Panther’s to contain. Both Smiths
scored a team—high 15 points and combined
to make eight free throws in nine attempts.

“They’re very good,” Kiesel said of the twin
sisters. “They play really well together, but I
think [ both teams? speed] takes away from
each other because we’re both so quick.” .

Kiesel’s quickness sparked a Panther run
four minutes into the second half.

Pitt’s nine unanswered points — including
seven from Kiesel — cut the deﬁcit to just six.
Though the Panthers would not get any closer,
coach Berenato said she was impressed with
Kiesel’s ability to control the game.

“Bri’s played the two [guard position] the
whole year, and then you have your point guard
on crutches,” she said. “It’s not like we had a

couple days to practice without [freshman
point guard] Brittany Gordon, but I thought
we adjustedreally well.” N L  _V

Along . th Kiésel, who ﬁnished; with 16
points, Lo ‘an  the onlyiother Pitt player
to reach double ﬁgures. The junior forward
notched a game—high 19 points and grabbed
eight rebounds. N

“_I just focused on going straight up and
down on my shot and making the shot,” Logan
said of her consistent jumper on Sunday. One
of the other things I really focused onjwas
when I missed a shot to not get too upset or
worried. I just had to move on to the next shot
and not get discouraged.”

Going forward, the Panthers will have to
adopt that attitude not only for their shooting,
but also their agonizing stretch of conference
play. They’ve lost their last 28 Big East games
— a streak dating back to March of 2011.

Pitt has a chance to earn its ﬁrst Big East
win of the year when it hosts Providence on
Wednesday at 7 p.m. I

And then, in the middle of the ensuing
San Francisco possession, a partial power
outage hit the Superdome, stopping play
for 34 minutes.

Once play resumed, the pattern of play
continued with the trailing team not taking
advantage of an opportunity that appeared
to be in its favor, and the score remained
28-6.

But after another stand by the 49ers’
defense, the offense began to come back,
guided by Kapernick’s strong arm down the
ﬁeld and culminating in a score.

And then on the following drive, the usu-
ally sure-handed Baltimore running back
Ray Rice fumbled the ball without getting
hit. The Niners would respond again with
Frank Gore scoring his only touchdown.

Not soon after, with San Francisco hold-
ing possession yet again, Akers pushed a
39-yard attempt left, but a 5—yard running
into the kicker penalty gave him a second
chance, which he converted.

And suddenly going into the ﬁnal quar-
ter, a 22-point deﬁcit became ﬁve in a mat-
ter of minutes.

A last-ditch goal-line effort by the San
Francisco defense forced the Ravens to
settle for a ﬁeld goal by Tucker.

Kaepernick again guided his team across
the turf before scrambling 15 yards into
the end zone to get within two points. The
decision to go for the two-point conversion
failed when his pass sailed well over the
head of Randy Moss.

Needing to continue to run down the
clock, Flacco lofted a pass up to Boldin,
who levitated and came down with the ball,
prolonging a drive that would result in a
38-yard Tucker ﬁeld goal and pushing the
margin to a crucial ﬁve points so that noth-
ing but a touchdown would fully erase it.

With Kaepernick still seemingly un-
fazed, the offense began one ﬁnal push,
highlighted by a Frank Gore 33-yard rush
up the far sideline to the seven. The Niners
moved forward 2 yards more to the ﬁve but
couldn’t progress any further.

And Baltimore would hold on, barely,
for the victory. 1
