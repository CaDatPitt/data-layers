Griﬂith Assails
Relief Works Aid
For Unemployed

Citizens’ League Official Brands
WPA Project As A “Farce;”
Censures Governor Earle

By James Donoghue

“The present relief situation here
is very bad. The Works Progress Ad-
ministration has been unsatisfactory
because it does not absorb all the un-
employed. Something drastic must
be done.”

George F. Griﬂiths, educational di-
rector of the Unemployed Citizens’
League, made these declarations at

"the weekly meeting of Inquiry Forum

Wednesday in Alumni Hall.

Mr. Griiﬁths spoke in place of Rob-
ert Lieberman, chairman of the UCL,
who was kept in Harrisburg to carry
on negotiations of the Action com-
mittee of the Unemployed Confer-
ence held last week-end with various
heads of State and relief departments.

Charging that the VVPA administra-
tion is not “human,” that its present
policy breaks down the scale of pre-
vailing union wages, the speaker went
on to say that “the unemployed have
found out that they can’t get help
from the administration. VVe must
go out and get the things we want our-
selves.”

Governor George Earle was cen-
sured by the speaker for not meeting
with a committee of the unemployed

‘who advocated calling a special ses-

sion of the legislature to handle the
present situation. If the governor re-
fuses to call a special session, the un-
employed mean to “picket” the execu-
tive ofﬁces; if the governor calls the
session, all available pressure will be
exerted on legislators to force through
the security legislation that the un-
employed consider necessary.
“Begging Time Has Passed”
“We mean to camp on their very
doorsteps and not to use a

 policy of kid glovesff he stated. “And

if these methods won't work then

‘we'll use _other methods._ The time

ltlnr begging has p_as‘-s.ed.f_.’,.   -. .. ..
“Do you expect unemployment in-

surance to help the unemployed-?” a.

student asked the speaker.

“It will help the future unemployed,”
answered Mr. Griffiths. “However,
we must realize that unemployment
is a permanent thing and we must
‘set up permanent machinery to deal
with it.”

The trend of the discussion cen-
tered soon afterward around the ques-
tion of wages on public works proj-
ects.

“What do you think the
scales should be for labor?”

“The scale should be a minimum of
$1 an hour for a 30-hour week and
the prevailing union scale for skilled
labor,” the speaker said.

“Do you think labor is worth $1 an
hour?”

“Under the present system labor
is not worth a cent an hour. The un-
employed do not want made work.
I-Ye want to do something socially
useful. VVe* want to do something of
value, not just push leaves from one
end of a park to another.”

“The particular group with which
I am associated is officially com-
mitted to a policy of production for
use,” he continued. “Therefore we
want a real works program but not
this farce known as the WPA.”

"No matter what happens,” he con-
cluded, “the unemployed intend to do
something.”

Griﬂith Awarded

First Ranking Chemistry Senior
Selected By Department

VVPA

John J. Griﬁith, C36, has been
chosen by the staff of the chemistry
department of the University for the
American Chemical Society member-
ship. The award is made annually

Ayars Features
School Assembly

Says Mere Technical Knowledge
Is Not Sufficient For Position

The inadequacy of mere technical
knowledge in applying for and se-
curing positions, was stressed by
Robert D. Ayars, professor of ac-
counting, in what appeared to be the
feature address of a third hour assem-
bly for students in the School of
Business Administration Iﬁednesday

.mo1:ning,,w. .  .-

I_ntroduced by Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, dean of the school, who first
spoke generally of the set-up of the
necessity of graduates maintaining a

school, Mr. Ayars emphasized the
high standard of neatness, politeness,
and “breeding” in the full sense, in
applying for positions in the business
world. _
Replete with examples of men forti-
ﬁed upon graduating with thorough
knowledge in their technical ﬁelds,
but who proved total failures when it
came to impressing prospective em-
ployers. the speaker called on the ap-
proximately 500 students present to
“look at your personalities.”
Sponsored by the Pitt Business In-
stitute, it was the ﬂrst assembly for

“Business Administration students this

year. Elmer Schriber, ’37, president
of PBI, introduced the officers of the
organization and reminded the audi-
ence of the coming “Bizad Buzzer”
project for Tuesday night.

Other speakers on the assembly
program were Dr. John M. Ferguson,
professor of economics, and Montfort
Jones, professor of ﬁnance, who gave
short talks. .

The advice of Mr. Ayars to the as-
sembly followed rather closely the
trends of advice administered in most
of the technical departments of the
University. Personality, over and
above technical skill, he stated, has
become more and more important in
recent years, and employers are look-
ing not only for “A” students, but for
those who f‘have the power of making
good impressions and making better
friends."

PBI To See German
Films At Next Buzzer

Pitt Business Institute, business ad-
ministration student organization,
will hear Dr. John F. L. Raschen, pro-
fessor of modern languages, atits
second Bizad Buzzer of the season
Tuesday evening at 8 o’clock in Room
1309, Cathedral.

Dr. Raschen will exhibit a series of
pictures which he took in Germany
during a trip in 1934. He will also
speak on current issues and will an-
swer questions concerning the pres-
ent German regime.

At the business meeting in the ﬁrst
part oil the evening, plans for a PBI-
sponsored tea dance will be consid-
ered.

Members will be admitted free; ad-
mission for non-members from the
School of Business Administration
who may attend will be 25 cents,
which may be applied toward payment
for a membership card. Faculty
members of the School are invited to
attend.

Barbara Thomas, ’37, chairman of
the refreshments committee, has
promised plenty of eats and smokes.
Richard Brenneman, ’36, is in charge
of the program.

Pre Ed Faculty Meets

The combined faculty committee
Whlc-_h interviewed -applicants to the
School of Education last week will
meet late this afternoon to decide the
fate of the pre-eds.

Science Honoraries
Present Palmer
At Dormont

“Friday the thirteenth is no bugaboo

for us,” said Miss Virginia Kirk, 037,?

when asked about the Collembo1ae-
Quax dance tonight. “Neither are the
Pitt Riﬂes and Dents. “Furthermore,”
she added, raising her eyebrows deli-
cately, “aren’t we saying it with
ﬂowers, so to speak?” '

Miss Kirk is chairman of the social
committee‘ of the two honorary natu-
ral science fraternities which are stag-
ing their combined annual Christmas
dance affair tonight. ~

Don Palmer and his orchestra will
synchronize for the dancers at the
New Century Club, 2688 Glenmoré
Avenue, Dormont. Those who attend-
ed the football dances this year will
remember the particular style of mel-
ody in which the Palmer boys are
specialists.

Tickets are still on sale in Room
1009, Cathedral, or from Elizabeth
Metzger, C36; Renetta Heiss, Ed37;
Dorothy Benson, Ed36; Norman
Blickle, C36; and Jack Zubrod, Ed35.
The price is $1 a couple.

Chaperons for the dance are Dr. and
Mrs. Robert T. Hance, Dr. and Mrs.
G. M. McKinley, and Dr. and Mrs.
Samuel H. Williams.

Panther To Purr
‘Merry Yuletide’

In Coming Issue

The Pitt Panther appears for the
last time this year on Vvednesday,
full of the Christmas spirit and all
that.

Sunny Vveslager, Panther editor in
’31, gets back into print some of his
well-known wit—some of the seniors
will remember him, anyhow——in “An
Editor Never Forgets.”

Robert Saffron, C39, has another
something-or-other entitled “Ballyhoo
for Haile.” And to show that college

studen,t_s4,_h_a.y,en’t i’orgo_tten , their [bed-,

time stories, Ruth‘ Nickel pens a
“Dear Santa Claus” letter.
“A Gift for Bertha,” by an anony-
mous contributor, and a cover car-
toon by Editor Russell Connolly, C36,
complete the Christmas theme.
“Don't forget the jokes and car-
toons,” says Editor Connolly as usual.

University President
Will Speak_At Forum

Dr. Mordecai Johnson, president of
Howard University, will address the
Pittsburgh Community Forum next
Monday evening, in the Schenley
High School auditorium, at 8:15
o’clock.

Besides having been president of
Howard University since 1926 and a

former professor of economics and
history at Morehouse College, Dr.
Johnson is a prominent theologian,

having been ordained in the Baptist
ministry in 1916. Always actively in-
terested in social problems, Dr. John-
son will speak on the subject of
“America and the Race Problem.”

Following the address by Dr. John-
son, there will be an open forum dis-
cussion.

‘Ours Will Be Best,’
Threatens Dent
C0-Chairman

“I’d nominate the Dental Interfra-
ternity Council dance‘ as the best of
the three school affairs coming off
this evening,” said Zelly Alpert, one
of the co-chairman of the DIC com-
mittee.

“But then I’m prejudiced,” he add-
ed. 

At any rate, there seem to be lit-
erally hundreds of others who agree
with him, from the way the $2 tickets
are being sold, according to another
co-chairman.

The ﬂoor is that of the University
Club and the music will be provided
.by Jack Mason and his orchestra,
which is still having a bit of difficulty
getting its accented notes right, after
playing for the Harvard sophomore
prom. The hour is approximately 9
o’clock.

The committee, which also sells the
tickets at $2 a couple, includes the
co-cha.irma.n Daniel Lonberger, D36;
Charles McMechan, D36; and Alpert,
D36; and James Goldblum, D37; Jack
Bailey, D37; and Eugene Engelskirger,
D36.

Model Governing
Body To Convene

Applicants For Annual Collegiate
Conference To Meet Monday

On Monday at 3:30 o’clock, in Room
202, Alumni Hall, a preliminary meet-
ing will be held to draw up tentative
plans for the third annual Intercol-
legiate Conference on Government.

Meeting for the ﬁrst time two years
ago, students representing 35 colleges
and universities met in Harrisburg,

and drew upa model-constitntion...for.

the State of Pennsylvania. Last year,
a second meeting was held in the
form of a model legislative session,
using the model constitution as a
basis. of procedure.

According to tentative plans of
Miss Genevieve Blatt, graduate as-
sistant in political science, and direc-
tor of the past two conferences, this
year’s meeting will take the form of
model presidential nominating con-
ventions.

Miss Blatt further stated, “The prac-
tical experience to be gained from
these meetings is immeasurable.
After listening to professors discuss
political conventions, the student is
given an opportunity to put his learn-
ing to good use.”

The University contingent will have
two faculty advisers this year, in-
stead of one. Dr. James C. Charles-
worth, associate professor of political
science, and Dr. Roger V. Shumate,
instructor in political science, will
serve.

Students interested in a project of
this sort, and government students in
particular, are invited to attend this
initial meeting.

Assembly Discussion
Approves, Rejects
New, Old Ideas

By Herbert Rackoff

The Student-Faculty Assembly ad-
journed its meeting at 10:45 o’clock
Tuesday evening,

The committee on committees made
its 22-point report.

And thereupon followed the longest,
most active debate that SFA has held
this year.

It all started when Israel Goldberg,
C36, chairman of the committee on
committees, asked that each of his 22
points be taken up and discussed
separately by the entire assembly.
Captain D. C. '1‘redennick, assistant
professor of military science, ques-
tioned the right of the assembly to
accept and discuss this report.
Others in the assembly, however,
overruled the captain’s suggestion to
have the committee on committees
report to the executive group.

Enthusiasm greeted the ﬁrst few
points of the program Goldberg pre-
sented. Immediately passed was the
motion to select a committee to pro-
vide “frequent student forums ad-
dressed by prominent speakers.” The
purpose of this committee, according
to Goldberg, will be to call forums,
not every week at a speciﬁc time, but
upon any occasion when a particu-
larly good speaker is available. This
would tend to eliminate the “show
must go on” idea, and would raise
the calibre of forum speakers.

Suggests High School Contacts

A high school contacts committee
to obtain entertainers for assemblies
and speakers for high school “Go to
College” clubs was agreed upon as
point number two. Also provided for
was a sub—fresl1man day group to su-
pervise the entertainment of high
school students on campus during the
sub-freshman clay in the spring. The
assembly recommended that this oc-
casion not be held on Tap Day, but
during some other part of Spring
Festival. week.»

At this point Lois Follansbee, C37, ’

moved that a committee be appointed
to look into all the rest of the 22
points, and that the assembly ad-
journ. However, Charles Ebert, C36,
pointed out that since it was only
9:30, SFA still had plenty of time, and
should debate these proposals as a
committee of the whole. Miss Fol-
lansbee’s motion was then defeated
by a large vote. A motion by Dale
Van Ormer, C37, to limit subsequent
discussion to the next twenty min-
utes failed because of lack of a sec-
ond.

A short debate resulted in the pass-
ing of points five, six, and seven, call-
ing for the appointment committees
for Scholars’ Day, a spring peace as-
sembly, and frequent activities as-
semblies.

Although admitting and regretting
the present isolated condition of stu-
dents in the Pharmacy School, SFA
agreed that any action it might at-
tempt would probably prove ineffect-
nal. However, a committee was ap-
pointed to investigate any possibili-
ties of removing this isolation.

Discuss Newsreel

A men’s council, similar to the
WSGA, with the power of passing
upon all matters relating solely to
men, is to be organized. Miss Thyrsa
VV. Amos, dean of women, spoke in
favor of this idea as a means of
keeping such matters out of SFA,
since the assembly properly has jur-
isdiction over matters relating only
to men and women, alike.

A reception by the Chancellor for
the graduating seniors and their par-
ents was the committee’s twelfth pro-
posal. SFA agreed that a group be
appointed to aid the Chancellor's com-
mittee in preparing for such an event.

Discussion as to whether the news-
reel project, dropped last year by
SFA after being proved ﬁnancially un-
successful, should be resurrected re-
sulted in a decision to investigate the
question. Goldberg pointed out that
the greatest reason for its failure ‘was
the fact that there were no facilities
for it on campus. He recommended
that the newsreel be held in a Uni-
versity building, a11d be projected by
sound and movie apparatus leased or
purchased by the University. The as-
sembly was dubious as to this latter
point, but recommended its investi-
gation.

A student post oﬁice in the Cathe-
dral to replace the services now per-
formed by Miss Mary Milburn, of the
dean of men’s oﬂice, was debated
heatedly before being passed. It was
pointed out that the cost of setting up
boxes for each student would soon be
defrayed by the saving on stamps
and time by the University oﬂices in
contacting a student, and that its con-
venience could hardly be overrated.
Transportation rates for students was
brought up as point number 16. It
was not greeted over-enthusiastically,

The Committee Reports

HE STUDENT FACULTY ASSOCIATION was

E not abashed, it seems, by the 22-point program
proposed by the committee on committees.
After quite a bit of debate, the group went on rec-
ord as favoring all but four of the points submit-
ted. No one can deny that 18 out of 22 is a mighty
healthy average and the committee evidently did

its work well.

But, as the gentleman over the radio is wont to
say, “it’s only the beginnin’, folks.” Now that
SFA has voted its willingness to consider each
pla.n, it has a splendid opportunity to secure for
itself some mighty ﬁne commendation by tracking
down not half of these points, but all of tliein.

Some of the propositions, such as the student
post office plan and the possibility of combating the
isolation of the School of Pharmacy, appear to be a
year or two away. The completion of the Cathe-
dral so far as to permit a centralized arrangement
of classes will be necessary before these two proj-
ects can be fairly developed.

Several of the propositions set forth seem to
have been in effect in a passable manner before.
The Scholars’ Day, book exchange, peace assembly,
and Chancellor ’s Reception for graduating seniors
and their parents appear to be ideas that have been
well carried out last year. There certainly can be
no harm in repeating a good thing.

The newsreel proposition is advanced once again,
with the idea of using University-owned equipment
in a University building. It doesn't seem possible
to cut the price of admission to such events much
below that of last year, and if that was the cause
of the failure then, despite the tremendous amount
of highly favorable publicity put forth to attract
the interest of students, there appears to be scant
hope for a better record this year.

The remaining projects appear not quite so glam-
orous, but may prove none the less successful. The
point is that SFA has a chance to see what kind of
a harvest it can reap from those 18 seeds.

Salute To Johnstown

ODAY THE UNIVERSITY women welcome 30
Tof their cousins from the Jolinstown Center.

They’ll be treated to a merry round of wo-
men’s activities on campus, not the least of which
will be the annual women’s Interclass Sing.

In the few years that the University has main-
tained its extension school in the Flood City, quite
a number of students have come from there to
Pittsburgh to complete work for their degrees.
More than a few of that number have entered into
local activities, ﬁnding the jump not too difficult,
and have risen to high positions in those activities.

To be sure, it must seem strange at times for the
J ohnstown students, from a distance of 70 miles, to
watch affairs going on down here at an institution
to which they most certainly belong. It is surely
with an idea toward integrating the distant rela-
tives to the spirit of the main school that has re-
sulted in the planning of their visit today.

‘We hope you J ohnstowners will like Pitt and
Pitt people down here. And we hope you ’ll ﬁnd
all of your future days in Pittsburgh as entertain-
ing and proﬁtable as this one promises to be.

Sometimes we are inclined to scoff at our sev-
eval large debtor nations whose treasuries, while
holding ample funds for war preparations, are
claimed not full enough to pay their World I/Var
debt, especially when little Finland——not being
mad at a.nybody—pays her share right on the dot.
It might result in an interesting parallel could we
unearth the number of those students who attend
dance affairs tonight and have not yet made the

There’s Gold In Them Thar’ Hills

And This Student Owns Some Of It

A
7

By Edwin' H. Beachler

How would you like to be 18 years
old and part owner in ﬁve promising
gold and copper claims, the smallest
of which recently netted $10,000 for
a start? '

You would have passed your ﬁrst
eight years deep in the province of
Quebec, combating a 40-degree sub-
zero “chill” and ﬁrst learned to walk
on snowshoes.

Then when you were 12, Indians
would have beaten you to your trap
line and made off with $60 worth of
martin, fox, and mink pelts instead of

having youthful “pirates” dupe you
out of your prize red and white
agates.

You would not have spoken English
until your 14th birthday, resorting
only to the Caiiiick-French in your
home. You would have called your
ﬁrst moose to the kill at this time and
guided your first American hunter to
a wat.sr—hole three months later.

At 15 you would have made your
ﬁrst “strike.” ‘When it failed to pan
out, you would immediately have un-
dertaken a seven-day “prospect.” re-
quiring no less than 25 portages.
After a three-month “dig” terininated
by a low freeze and heavy snow, you
would have distributed your heavy
load on your father’s and your backs
to begin a weary return on foot to
Capitachiian.

If you've stuck to the trail this far,
you now are pretty well acquainted
with Homer Sigouin——trapper, pros-
pector, geologist, master of both Eng-
lish and French, and a student in the
University at 18 years of age.

Homer is the oldest of 10 children
in the Sigouin family, ruled by
mother Eleanor and father Emil-a.
Homer stands ﬁve feet, six inches tall,
carrying a stocky 145 pounds. VVith
sharp gray eyes and a wide smile, he
keenly follows your movements when
you talk, occasionally raising bushy
eyebrows that deepen the heavy
lines in his forehead when he misses
a word. Eager to understand every
word, he occasionally interrupts to
raise questions.

You always get the full effect when
Homer tells a story. If the bear goes
“Ump, Ump,” just before the ﬁnish

of Mr. Bruin, Homer goes “Ump,
Ump,” when he relates the experi-
ence. If he"s telling you about driv-

ing his two husky dogs, “Mejan” and
“Beauty,” to victory over a. foiir-mile
course in 15 minutes to cop the new
Harnen cup, Homer pulls the guide

SFA Group Acts
On Year’s Plans

(Continued From Page One.)
but a committee was appointed to in-
vestigate the matter. Several assem-
bly members were doubtful as to the

.merits of this move, but David Raou-
- sin, C37, was conﬁdent

that some
agreemciit could be made with the
transportation companies.

Since the University has available
a great number of scholarships and
exchange fellowships and scholar-
ships, Goldberg recommended that a
committee be appointed to publicize
them, and make the information avail-
able to any interested student.

In the discussion, Charles Holstein,
C-36, remarked that the registrai"s
office feared it would be “swamped,”
should this information become public
property. SFA ﬁnally agreed that
these scholarships should be public-
ized to a certain extent, feeling that
it was unlikely that the registrar’s
office would ever be overrun with
seniors seeking fellowships to do
graduate work. “And if they are
swamped,” said Holstein, “at least
t.hat’s better than having scliolarships
going begging for someone to take
them.”

To assist in formulating ediica.tio1i—
al policies recommending new courses
and new methods, a committee was
appointed to work in conjunction with
the faculty committee for that pur-
pose. A course in musical apprecia-
tion was one example mentioned as
to what this committee could do.

To prepare an SFA budget for what
is to be spent during the year, and
for apportioning the income fairly, a
suggestion was made to the executive
committee that it appoint a budget
committee under its jurisdiction.

Suggest Student Poll

The 21st suggestion of the commit-
tee oii committees was a proposal to
find some way of making a poll of
student opinion all over the campus,
in order to aid SFA in forming its
policies, and to make it more repre-
sentative. SFA, however, decided that
SFA was a good representation of
student opinion, and that it was not
necessary to ask students what they
thought of SFA and its policies. The
motion, fathered by Holstein, was
voted down.

A survey of the existing situation
iegardiiig dance chairman appoint-
ments and the methods by which
dances are promoted, the 22nd point,
was delegated to William McQuade,
E37, and his social committee.

Immediately before adjournment,
Iiacusin moved that any student of
the University be permitted, with the
consent of William Harvey, C38,
chairinan, and the assembly, to ad-
dress the assembly from the ﬂoor.
This motion, which, according to
tacusin, is a. “fair, liberal, demo-
cratic step,” was passed by a large
vote.

Charles Herald, C36, chairman of
the customs committee, reported on
the results of the 1935 customs pro-
gram for freshmen, recently com-
pleted. He recommended its con-
tinuance and expansion, with a possi-
bility that methods for the organiza-
tion of classes might arise from a
more congenial class spirit by the
customs program.

Committees to carry out the plans
passed upon Tuesday will be appoint-
ed within the week by Harvey.

The next SFA meeting will be held
on Tuesday evening, January 14.

A prominent banker of Pittsburgh
has made it possible for Homer to
attend the University since Novem-
ber 1, of last year. The youthful
prospector at present is listed as a
special student, carrying approxi-
mately 15 hours a week in minerol-
og , geology, and special English iii-
structioii sessions.

It was early last fall that a. party of
Pittsburghers, including his benefac-
tor visited Sigouin Capitachuan (pro-
nounccd -Ca-pe-ta-cliu-an) hunting
lodge, 120 miles north of Amos, the
closest town to the Sigouin home.

While acting as guide to the party
in search of game, one in the group
heard Homer express the desire to be
a minerologist. On the following
night, before an open camp ﬁre, the
“world’s luckies’ boy,” as he calls
himself, was asked if he would like
to attend the University of Pittsburgh.

Homer relates that he was so ex-
cited he could not even remember “if
I said yes for sure,” as he dashed
inside to tell his mother of the good
fortune and ask her permission to
make it certain. .

He received his ﬁrst schooling in
the fall of 1929 at the Victoriavillc
Commercial college. In 1931, one
Frank VV. Smith of Jamestown, New
York, came to the Srguoin club on a
hunting trip and encouraged Homer
to return with him to Jamestown in
order that he might continue his
education.

Homer entered the seventh grade in
the Junior Washington High School
in that town, and reported difficulty
only in speaking English during his
ﬁrst few months there. When Smith
moved to Florida in the subsequent
September, Homer could not return to
school.

Staying at home until the fall of
1934, Homer had almost given up
schooling ideas when the Pittsburgh
pa.rty of hunters arrived to change
the routine of his hunting, ﬁshing,
trapping and prospecting forays.

This fall, Homer was the third
member of a trio headed by his uncle
journeying north to Chibougama to
prospect for gold and copper. Ac-
cording to research reports from the
Mellon Institute, the rocks showed
good formations of gold and silver
present in the pieces Homer brought

down for analysis.

His richest strike, not very far from
the earlier ones, came just before he
returlied to the University for the
fall session. From one of the weekly
family letters in la.te October Homer
learned that his father had sold one
of the smaller claims for $10,000.
Vl/‘hile in Pittsburgh, Homer hopes to
interest someone in investing capital
to put a mine in operation on one of
the claims.

His desire to be a miuerologist was
encouraged by a father who continu-
ally urged him to read about the min-
ing business at any available oppor-
tuuity.

Ionier has a “girl friend” in Betty
Pitt (no direct relation to the school,
he hastily assures you) of Jamestown,
New York. Homer met her when at-
tending school there and stops off to
see her on his trips home to Capi-
tachuan each spring.

Laurel, of the Laurel and Hardy
comedy team, is his favorite movie
star, since both visited the Sigouin
lodge in a party that included Lionel
Barrymore in 1932. _

The hobbies he intends to follow
after he has made “plenty of money”
he conﬁdes are two: First, to buy a
Ford motor for a boat that he will
personally enter in championship
races. With a Johnson 32 motor,
Homer has already achieved a speed
of 51.3 miles per hour in boats of his
own construction. Second, he will
secure two guns of .22 and .38 cali-
bres, similar in every possible detail.
He has been a hunting addict ever
since he shot his ﬁrst moose at 13
years of age. '

Homer admits he is just itching to
get back to Canada to help his Dad.
but at the same time he assures you
that he “likes Pittsburgh and all his
friends here very much.” He hopes
someday to be able to give other fel-
lows “who might be in the woods and
unable to go to school” a chance to
obtain schooling. Considering him-
self “the world's luckies’ boy,"
Homer is very grateful for the good
fortune which brought him here.

On Thursday, December 19, Homer
leaves for a. two—week school of pros-
pecting iii Toronto, Canada, expect-
ing tOil‘(-38111118 his studies here on
January 6. This semester he lives
at the home of Dr. Richard E. Sher-
rill, associate professor of geology,
having stayed with James Potts, as-
sistant track and cross country coach,
during the 1934-35 school year.

The George W. Curtis Club, named
in honor of the leadiiig advocate of
civil service reform in the United
States and well—known editor. was be-
gun by several freshmen registered in
the government training course.
With the cooperation and assistance
of D1‘. James C. Cliarlesworth, asso-
ciate professor of political science and
coordinator of the °'ovei'nmenta1 serv-
ice division. several meetings were
held in which the organization of the
club was developed.

A constitution committee was ap-
pointed by Dr. Charleswortli, com-
posed of Miss Leyton, chairman;
Thomas Dillon, C37; James Dono-
ghue, C38; Eichelberger; Ida Gigli-
otti, C39; and Herbert Searle, C39.

The cliarter of the Curtis Club is
now before the SFA committee on
charters where it is expected to be
approved shortly.

The cabinet will bring persons
prominent in the local and national
civil service to speak to the group.

The next meeting of the club will
be held January 7 in Alumni Hall.
All members of the governmental
service course are requested to at-
tend.

Gridmen Attempt To Hobble

Trojans’ Ho

rse Tomorrow

 

Sutherland May Start Sophomore Matisi At Left Tackle;

Panthers Anxious To C

hange California Luck

 

About the time that the average Pittsburgher is sitting down to

the usual scanty Saturday evening

repast, the Golden Panthers will

run out onto the green turf of the Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow
afternoon to face their ﬁnal grid opponents of the 1935 season, the

Southern California Trojans.

Except for a few post season games yet to be played, this inter-
sectional clash will just about wind up football worries for another

eight months. A large crowd of coast‘:
sport followers, including the numer-
ous Pitt alumni who reside on the
Paciﬁc coast, is expected to watch the
festivities.

Coach Sutherland’s Pa.nther squad
suffered no serious effects from the
two-and-a-half day train ride and has
been hard at work since VVednesday
polishing up rough spots in team play.
For the ﬁnal game, the Pitt boys will
probably use every available trick
against the Trojans to make the Cali-
fornia folks forget the somewhat hap-
less experiences of former Pitt teams
011 the coast.

Both teams have gone through nine
games already this season, the
Trojans having dropped six out of
that number and the Panthers losing
but one. However, most of Southern
Cal’s setbacks have been very close
ball games with breaks playing the
deciding role.

Coach Howard Jones has had to de-
pend mostly on sophomores and jun-
iors to ﬁll the varsity jobs and the
youngsters have run alternately hot
and cold like a hotel shower. Victor-
ies over Montana and College of the
Paciﬁic were followed by a series of
four reverses. Illinois passed its way

to a 19-0 win and then followed a 13-7
triumph for Oregon State. The Cali-
fornia Bears took the sons of Troy in-
to camp by a 21-7 margin, and the Rose
Bowl representative for the VVest,
Stantorcl, beat Southern Cal with a
last-minute ﬁeld goal, 3-0.

The following week USC put on a
sensational last period ralfy to win
from VVashington State, 20-10, but
Notre Dame and \-‘Vashington added
more discomfort to the westerners in
the following two encounters.

The Trojans have been unusually
successful against the Blue and Gold
out on the coast. In 1930 they hand-
ed the Panthers probably their worst
licking of all time, to the tune of
47-14, and two years later, in another
Rose Bowl classic, a strong USO
eleven crushed the Pitt hopes, 35-0.

Coach Sutherland will have his
strongest eleven ready tomorrow to
avenge those losses. At the present
time a change in the varsity lineup
shows Tony Matisi, sophomore star,
replacing Daniell at left tackle.

Pitt Lineup Set

Otherwise, the Panther starting ar-
ray will bethe same one which started
against Carnegie Tech 011 Thanksgiv-
ing, with Souchak, Detzel, Glassford,

Captain Kliskey, Dalle Tezze, and
Sites rounding out the line and
lllichelosen, LaRue, Randour and

Patrick forming the backﬁeld.

The Trojans boast an outstanding
lineman in Gil Kul1n_. crack center.
Kuhn is ﬂanked by Shuey and Bros-
seau, a couple of more than fair
guards. Belko and Hall form the ﬁrst
string set of tackles, with Art Ditt-
berner also seeing plenty of service
in relief duties. Gene Hibbs and Chuck
Williams give USC a pair of ends who
are fast at getting down under passes.

Dave Davis, a copy of Cotton “Tar-
burton, and Glenn Thompson alternate
at quarterback in the Jones’ scheme of
play. Trojan halfbacks, used primar-
ily for blocking purposes, a.re headed
by Mansen and Langley, while Cliff
Probst is a ﬁne performer at fullback.

Varsity Wrestling
Card Announced

i‘«‘Ia.zeski Pleased With Prospects;
Bedillion Will Captain Squad

Showing plenty of spirit and enthu-
siasin, 40 men reported last Monday
to Ed Mazeski, new.wrestling coach,
and began a series of tough workouts
at the Stadium in preparation for the
coming season.

The manner in which Captain Rus-
sell Bedillion led the 40 candidates, in-
cluding new men and old in all weight
divisions, through the fundamentals
brought smiles to Coach l\/Iazeski. The
coach is higlny pleased with the pre-
season showing and is anticipating a
fairly good season despite the hard
schedule.

One of the hardest campaigns ever
attempted by a Pitt grappling team
handicaps the new coach, but he is op-
timistic in the outcome. The schedule
consists of six top-notch teams, who
have gained quite a reputation in the
past, for strong wrestling teams. One
noticeable feature of the schedule
shows the Panthers appearing in only
one home match.

Volleyball MoveCsﬁOut;
Boxing Is Postponed

Last night the lnterfraternity volley
ball championship was decided when
the winner 7f the Phi Kappa-Phi Delta
Theta semi-ﬁnal scrap and the Pi Kap-
pa Alpha—Delta Tau Delta contest met
in the ﬁnal game. .

Tuesday Delia Tap Delta lambasted
Kappa Sigma, 15-6 and 15-7, to gain a
morsel of revenge for the touch foot-
ball defeat. The Phi Delts, with Bill
Grosscope leading the attack, defeated
the Phi Gains, 17-15 and 15-8.

Originally scheduled for this week,
the intramural boxing tournament
has been postponed until January 13,

Coachﬂlson Calls
Tardy Trackmen

First Week Of Indoor Drill Ends;
Taano Is Off To Fine Start

“Freshman and varsity candidates
for the track team who have not al-
ready checked in, should do so imme-
diately,” states Carl Olson, track
coach.

With approximately 85 candidates
working out in the daily drills, com-
petition for freshman and varsity
berths dominated the opening week
of conditioning. ,

Eugene Taano, ﬁnnish—stylist in the
javelin, will bear plenty of watching
i11 his work—outs on the football prac-
tice ﬁeld. The spear throwers will
hardly compete during the indoor
campaign, but will nevertheless work.
to develop those arm, leg and coordi-
nating muscles so necessary in toss-
ing that spear to the heights of Mount
Olympus.

The annual Indoor All-University
meet has been tentatively scheduled
for the middle of January. In this
ti.tle—event, Olson expects many of the
present Indoor records to go by the
boards.

A quartet of quarter-milers will toss
aside their books following the mid-
semester exams to travel to New York
for the annual Millrose A. C. games
in Madison Square Garden on Satur-
day, February 1.

This will probably open the indoor
campaign for the Olsonmen. Fifty per
cent of last year’s crack relay team
return for their ﬁnal year of competi-
tion. ' Fred Kiger, captain and lead-off
man, along with Emmett MacDonald,
graduated last June. Charles Groat.
record-holder in the half-mile, and
Harold Connelly will see action again
this yea.r.

During the ﬁnal week of February,
the crack runners will compete in the
National AAU event.

Students Should Give
This Sport A Tumble

John Dambach, director of phys-
ical education, announces that the
athletic department will sponsor
a tumbling team.

Cheerleaders should be esperially
interested since Coach Brinker re-
quires that future cheerleading
candidates be able to pass certain
tumbling tests.

Dambaclrs initial practice ses-
sion will be held on Thursday, Jan-
uary 9, with weekly practices
scheduled on Thursdays for a
three-month period. “Beginners are
welcome to work out with the
team,” promises Dambach, “since I
plan to start with fundamentals on
January 8.”

Schricker Names
Foremost Mittmen

Needs Men In Heavier Classes;
Battle Still On For Berths

 

With the opening bouts on‘y weeks
away, Coach Schricker announces a
tentative boxing lineup. Close com-
petition for all posifions marked the
selection of the following men:

In the feather—weight class Russ
Vogel and Bernard Babcock are show-
ing up well, These two boxers tip
the scales at 119,

Al Paslowski and Henry Kaufmann
are the 129-pounders that have proved
their worth in training.

Abe Konick has been the only 139-
pound ﬁghter able to make the tenta-
ive lineup. ‘

But when it comes to the 145 pound-
ers, the selecting gets harder and
closer. échricker has not thus far
been able to discriminate between
John Stronko, George Kennedy, Ed
McAdams, Ray Tomarelli, or Herb
Cummings. This is the one class
where the positions are still wide

George Dines has stood out very
well in the 155-pound division, while
Cleon Linderman has thus far domin-
ated the 165-pounders.

Panthers Oppose Wildcats
On Evanston Floor Tonight

Carlson’s Cagers Face Northwestern, Iowa And Butler
In Annual Mid-West “Suicide” Invasion

 

Dr. Carlson and the Panther var-

Always difficult and
disastrous trip for the Panthers, the
present road series doubly earns its
title—suicide. It’s a triﬂe early in
the season to undertake such a trip,
especially with the Panthers just get-
ting themselves organized.
Glancing back into last season's rec-
ords, the Panthers of 1934 proved that
the word "suicide” can be juggled
around a bit to mean their opponents
instead of themselves. For last year
a scrappy bunch of Panthers took
three of the four games played with
the western teams.

Nortliwestern, the ﬁrst of the west-
erners to be met, tumbled the Cats,
42-28, to gain a lone decision. The
Panthers came back strong in the next
three, toppling Iowa., 38-26, Butler,
42-2-2, and ﬁnally Vvisconsin, 31-27.
Not much is known concerning the
three opponents of the Panthers. One
thing is certain, the district is noted
for its consistently fine basketball
teams and there is no reason to be-
lieve otherwise this year. Northwest-
ern, in its lone appearance this sea-
son, swamped Carleton, 57-20. Most
of the players on the Wildcat varsity
are sophomores.

- Dr. Carlson will probably send the
same lineup as used against Wash-
ington and Jefferson last Saturday in
the Vvildcat game tonight. The en-
tire ten players who saw action in
the Panthers‘ opening game were

sometimes¢

  
  
 

taken along on the trip. On the first
team are Captain Ted Roderick and
Bi 1 Jesko at the forwards, Joe Garcia.
at center, and two sophomores, Ed
Spotovich and Bob Johnson, taking
care of the guard positions.

The second team played brilliantly
against the Presidents Saturday and
will probably see a lot of action. It
was this team that piled 11p 1.8 points
to VV & J’s seven and pounded o11t a
victory for the Panthers, 41-35. Miles
Zelesnick a.nd Frank Loucks team up
at the forwards, with High Pete Noon
at center, and Luke Rowe and Rags
Radvansky at the guards on this ﬁve.

Groupswill Gather
At Heinz House
For Contest

W'oinen of the University will defy
the elements of superstition today by
attending en masse their annual Iii-
terclass Sing in Heinz House from
12:30 to 1:30 o’clock.

It has become an established tradi-
tion for each class to arrange musical
skits consisting of songs with original
lyrics and sometimes original tunes.

Then, too, there is a bronze loving
cup presented to the winner. Last
year the freshmen presented their
songs and skits in such manner as to
win the cup for the ﬁrst time in
years.

A jury of 13 will decide the harmon-
izing merits of each class, The
criteria for judging will be originality,
30 percent; attendance, 25 percent;
class spirit, 25 percent; suitability, 10
percent; and musical quality, 10 per-
cent. _ _

Bleachers are being erected in
Heinz House to accomodate the four
classes. Visitors to the Sing will in-
clude women from the Johnstown Cen-
ter of the University. _

The judges for the Sing are: Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, Miss Tliyrsa W’.
Amos, Dr. Lotte O. Lolistoeter, Dr.
Samuel H. Williams, Dr. Jlohn  Geise,
Dr. Manuel C. Elmer, Miss Ellen M.
Geyer, Dr. Andrew N. Cleven, Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford.  J3-TI‘-93
Stinchc-omb, Theodore A. Siedle, The-
odore W. Biddle, anc Robert D. Ayars.

The committee for the Sing is coin-
posed of the three class presidents
and their respective Sing chairman.

‘They are: Margaret Speer, Ed, and

Ruth Sochatoff, C, seniors; Kathryn
Hardy, C, and Betty Bryson, 0. lun-
iors; Janet Hallock, C, and Juniata
Steele, C, sophomores; and Mosse
Linglieim, C, freshman class repre-
sentative. who is being assisted by
Virginia Long. C36, as adviser of the
Glee Club unit.

Soho Youngsters
To Shake Hands
With Santa Claus

In observance of a tradition of ﬁf-
teen years standing, the Social Serv-
ice Committee of the YWCA will hold

its annual Christmas Party for chil-
dren on Vvednesday at Heinz House
from 3 to 5 o'clock.

The custom was first started in
1920 when children from the Salva-
tion Army were entertained. Since
that time the Committee, assisted. by
men from YMCA, has given a- party
annually with Settlement House chil-
dren as its guests.

Since 1923, it has been the custom
to bring children from the S0110 Day
Nursery to Heinz House for the aft-
ernoon. It will be observed again this
year.

Other children entertained pre-
vious to 1923 were from the Salvation
Army, Home for Colored Orphans,
and the Soho Settlement.

The children will play games, sing,
hear a Christmas story, and then they
will be ready for a visit by Santa
Claus.

 

Address By Graham

Features Unit Meeting

Robert K. Graham, instructor in
English, in charge of the University
news service, addressed the publica-
tions unit at a meeting Tuesday in
Room 205, Aluinni Hall. '

Choosing as a subject “Campus
Publications,” Mr. Graham pointed
out that the chief gain in this ﬁeld
is experience. The knowledge of how
to write, even though it is not to be
the ﬁeld for the iiidividual’s pro-
fession, is useful in club work and
other activities, he added.

At the conclusion of the meeting,
Ann VVhippo, chairman of the unit,
announced the members of the social
and program committees as follow\s,
social committee: Betty Jane Mar-
tin, cliairman, Mary Ann Ulrey, Betsy
Caldwell, Janice Rogaliner, Ruth
I-lerring and Helen Schein. The pro-
gram committee consists of Mary
Lewis‘; ‘chairman, Stella Kaﬁplalli
Helen Poole, Selina Horowitz, and
Helen Mrvosli.

The l'€lIl2.llllllg members of the unit
were assigned to cover the work of
other units for The Pitt News. A
Christmas party, to be held during
the Christmas vacation, is being
planned by the newly-appointed social
cominittee.
