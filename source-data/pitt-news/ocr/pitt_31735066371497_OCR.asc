Last week’s approval of a budget
for the I985 fiscal year, which will
include a tuition increase, the llth
such hike in as many years, came as a

surprise to few members of the Pitt I

community in the face of smaller
state appropriations and declining
enrollment.

The proposed budget of $383.4
million includes $87.1 million state
appropriation, a 7 percent increase
over last year's funding but short of
the l6.4 percent increase for which
Pitt had asked.

The same budget includes a $10.2
million, or 7 percent, raise in faculty
and staff salaries.

“I know the [tuition] raise was
necessary,” said ,lrwin Schulman,
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, whose tuition rose 9.5 per-
cent — from $2,420 to $2,650 for

‘in-state undergraduates.

Schulman said the “modest
increase" by the state and the need
for higher salaries to attract and
retain faculty created the situation in
which there was no alternative But to
raise tuition.

“People who start out now as
assistant professors are much worse
off than people who started as assist-
ant professors l0 years ago in terms
of whattheir salaries can buy,” he
said. “Pitt had to raise salaries; it
was caught in this shortfall — we’re
not getting enough support else-
where, so raising tuition was the
only solution.”

The tuition increase for fiscal year
I984 was also 9.5 percent for under-
graduate CAS students, raising tui-
tion from $2,210 to $2,420.

First-year medical school stu-
dents were the hardest hit by last
year’s budget, with a 20.8 percent, or
$2,000, raise. This year, their tuition
increase was the lowest in the univer-
sity at 4.3 percent.

This year’s increases have law
school students digging the deepest,
with a 12.1 percent, or $460, raise.
According to the proposed budget,
in-state law students will be paying
$4,250 and out-of-state students will
pay $7,940 a year.

Dean John Murray's original
recommendation for an increase in
lawschoolgtuition was for no more
than $4,000 and $7,500 for in- and
out-of-state students respectively.

Tuition hike surprises few

“The law school is getting to the
point where it is competing with pri-
vate school tuition,"'Murray said,
“Out-of—state°tuition in particular is
difficult because it is ranking us

among the high-tuition law schools I
. in the country.”

He said the in-state tuition is still a
“bargain” for Pitt law students, even
with the increase, considering the
quality of their education.

Although a salary increase may
keep quality educators at Pitt, the
resulting tuition increase has put
students in a’ double bind as finan-
cial aid becomes harder to get.

“The amount of federal money
that's available has been decreased
significantly because of cuts,” direc-
tor of admissions Joseph Merante

"said. “The burden [of the tuition
_hike] really goes onto shoulders of

the parents and the students."

Students and administrators spec-
ulated, on the impact the increase
will have on this fall's enrollment
and what’s in store in the future for
tuition at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Educator warns of C. Americathreat

By Adam Elsenstcit
Staff Writer

The vital security of the United
States is threatened by Cuban and
Soviet adventurism in Central
America, according to John Silber,
president of Boston University and a
member of President Reagan‘s
National Bipartisan Commission on
Central America. Silber spoke on
campus last Tuesday on “Central
American Realities and North
American Myths” as part of the
American Experience lecture series.

The commission. headed by
former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and often referred to as the
Kissinger Commission, released a
I32-page report last January calling
for increased military and economic
aid to the region totalling $8 billion
over the next five years. The report,
which warned of a growing commu-
nist influence in the region, included

._a set of recommendations that has 8

since become the basis for Reagan

administration policy in Central

America.
Silber began his lecture by saying
that the commission was a biparti-

san mix of individuals, thus making
its reportunbiased and credible. The
commission was made up of many
diverse individuals with different
views who agreed unanimously on
the bulk of the report, he said.
“There is no reason to believe the
men of the commission could be co-
opted by Reagan. They owed him
nothing. I

“We agreed that a revolution was
sweeping Central America —— caused
by hunger, ignorance, poverty and
injustice —- and that the situation
called for democratic solutions,"
Silber said. He went on to note that
U.S. neglect was responsible for
many of the problems there now. To I
illustrate this, he pointed out‘that
only a short time ago, $l00 million,
if spent on medical care, could have
wiped out dysentery and other easily
preventable diseases and added an

average of 25 years to the life expec- '

tancy of Central Americans.

In recent years, however, this once
easily managed situation has been
complicated by Soviet and Cuban
influence. he said. “The communists
took advantage of the void of aid to
Central America and exploited the

inactivity of the US," Silber said.
“It is folly for -us to believe that
Soviet and Cuban influence is for
humanitarian reasons. It is for the
continuation and spread of
revolution."

Silber cited the introduction of
sophisticated new offensive wea-
pons to Cuba by the Soviets as evi-

gdenceof their growing influence in

Central America and the threat
communism poses to U.S. security.

In describing Nicaragua‘s Sandi-
nista regime, allegedly the prime
target of communist influence,
Silber called it a “repressive totali-
tarian regime." To support this
claim, he listed some ongoing poli-

~ cies of the Sandinista government,

including rigid ‘press censorship.
confiscation of church property,
suspension of collective bargaining
and strikes and the establishment of
a “thought police"type ofinformant
system in which people are encour-
aged to expose anti-Sandinistas-

Throughout his lecture, Silber
emphasized how volatile and dan-
gerous the Soviet inﬂuence is in a

Recent actions taken on behalf of
the faculties in the Schools of Medi-
cine and Law have. resulted in the
indefinite postponement of Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board
(PLRB) hearings on collective bar-
gaining for the faculty in the pro-
vost’s area.

Set to begin last Wednesday, the
public hearings before the PLRB
had already been rescheduled once,
to” Monday, May 21, by agreement
of the attorneys for the faculties,
which are divided over collective
bargaining, and those for the Pitt
administration, which strongly

‘opposes it.

At a pre-hearing conference held
last Thursday, PLRB hearing exam-.
iner Elliot Newman accepted a peti-
tion fromthe faculty of Pitt’s law
school, requesting that _it be repre-
sented for bargaining purposes by its
own organization, the Pitt Law
Faculty Association (PLFA).

This action, coupled with the
recent efforts of the Faculty Associ-
ation of the School of Medicine
(FASM) to disclaim interest in
representing Pitt’s medical faculty,
changed the legal situation suffi-
ciently to necessitate an indefinite
postponement, according to Philip
Wion, president of United Faculty
(UF).

United Faculty is the organization
seeking to bargain collectively for
the faculty in the provostls area.
University administrators have
argued that a unit including only the

provost’s area faculty is not an

In regard to Nicaragua‘s role in this
heavy concentration of Soviet influ-

,__ence, he said it is “well on its way to

developing a military well out of
proportion to anything in Central
America.... Countries in the region,
without exception, are afraid of
Nicaragua’s military build-up.”

In reference to El Salvador, Silber
said the I982 elections as well as
those of this spring were “remarka-
bly free and remarkably fair." He
also said the Salvadoran army will
support the results of the elections
and 'there will be a “substantial
improvement in human rights.”

Silber said he agrees with the stra-
tegy of El Salvador’s recently

defeated right-wing presidential,

candidate Roberto D‘Aubuisson,
who believes the rebels must first be
defeated before substantive social
programs and civil rights can be
implemented. This, said Silber, is
the essence of the Kissinger report,
which calls for a five-year, multi-
billion dollar program of “almost
simultaneous” medical, agricultural

appropriate one because it excludes
those faculty in law, medicine and
the health professions.

The legal bargaining unit was to
have been determined duringithe
postponed hearings. Once the hear-
ings have been rescheduled, attor-

neys for all parties will present argu-

ments for or against unionization of
the various Pitt faculties.

According to- Mark Nordenberg,
chairman of the law faculty steering
committee, the petition to the PLRB
followed an “authorization card”

, drive during which “cards we signed

by virtually all members of the law
[school] faculty.” The signing of a
card, however, represents only a
request for an election on collective
bargaining and does not commit a
faculty member to vote for collective
bargaining if an election is held.

Nordenberg discussed the reasons
for this move by law faculty. “The
faculty association, during the last
set of hearings on faculty unioniza-

tion at Pitt in 1976, did intervene‘

and was successful in having the
School of Law determine a separate
bargaining unit,” he said. The goals
of the current intervention are the
same, according to Nordenberg. “It
is difficult to predict what course
these hearings are going to follow.
By intervening, we have most effec-
tively preserved ourioptions.” A
majority of law professors, he
explained, oppose any effort to
include them in a university-wide
faculty union.

In a related matter, the PLRB
issued an order to de-certify the
Faculty Association ofthe School of
Medicine (FASM) as a legal bar-
gaining agent after receiving a letter
from FASM president David Fein-
gold. Feingold’s letter indicated that
FASM no longer has any interest in
representing medical faculty,
according to sources close to the
issue.

, If this de-certification remains
unchallenged, the faculty ‘in the
medical school could be included in
the same bargainingunit as the pro-
vost’s area faculty. The administra-

tion favors this development and the »

U F opposes it because of the widely-
held belief that physicians will vote
against unionization in any election.

The administration may find itself
charged with unfair labor practices
as a result of its role in the FASM
de-certfication, according to Wion.
In a recent printed statement, Uni-
ted Faculty charged that the admin-
istration, not the medical faculty,
initiated the medical school meet-
ings at which faculty were “pressed"
to vote for dissolution oftheir agent.

“The Unfair Practices section of
the Pennsylvania Public Employee
Relations Act prohibits employers
from ‘interfering, restraining or
coercing employees in the exercise of
the rights guaranteed‘ by the act,”
the statement said. “The act also
prohibits employers from ‘dominat-
ing or interfering with the forma-
tion, existence or administration of

Qglumn

Study nutrition,
not vivisection

By James M. Crary
Columnist

The medical community at the
University of Pittsburgh seems to
have lost its sanity. How else does
one explain both the malicious treat-
ment of laboratory animals and the
refusal ofa grant for a nutrition cen-
ter? A presumable respectable insti-
tution working for the betterment of
human life can scarcely ignore the
benefits of a proper diet on health
and the sensitivity of fellow beings
from other species without eventu-
ally arousing doubts about the real
intentions of that institution.

If Pitt considers itself a humane
institution, which presumably it
does, it must change its policies on
the Nutrition Center and abolish
animal experiments. Otherwise, it
must forfeit respect.

Like the flesh and acid experi-
ments in Treblinka during the '1 9405,
hormone extraction and radiation-
exposure tests are often justified
through the lie of “genetic superior-
ity.” Knowledge about DNA and
evolutionary processes should not
be used to justify a murderous
elitism.

It is unpleasant to view similari-
ties between a concentration camp
and the campus medical.labs, but the
facts force the comparison. The
criminal nature ofthese experiments

is particularly difficult to ignore
when you've seen lemurs (wonderful
monkeys from Madagascar) des-
troyed first-hand.

Many people have viewed pic-
tures of vivisection experiments and
more still have read reports, and
some legislation has been intro-
duced to the House of Representa-
tives. Yet the silence drowns the
screams. The only resistance or
action seen at the university was a
vigil held by a crackpot organization

I called Mobilization for Animals. It

is time for medically trained scholars
to discredit the assertion that vivi-
section is necessary.

Far too much faith is placed in the
integrity of physicians. There is time
for some polite controversy, but the
medical community has diseased
sensibilities and must be treated for
its own good.’

Animal vivisection is morally
wrong and therefore criminal. Laws
must be passed forbidding these
experiments, and our institution can
lead the way. The pain experienced
by animals is far too high a price to
pay for curative medicine. How
many more lives would be saved if
we devoted our research to
nutrition?

Posvor locks concern, students’
sofety o n streets threotened

The chancellor of a major univer-
sity such as Pitt is a position ofgreati
prestige and power in society.
Anyone who has seen even the vice-
chancellor's university-paid man-
sion knows this. There is much they
can do for students when they are
willing and accessible officials. 1
hate to go behind someone’s back,
for Chancellor Posvar has never
written to The Pitt News about me.
But with all respect, I feel Chancel-
lor Posvar has in no way shown the
concern or responsibility his posi-
tion calls for, particularly in the mat-
ter of student safety in crossing the
street_s.

He has turned a deaf ear to all of

us in this matter of simple student
safety going from class to class. The
chancellor was kind enough to
finally respond to several letters, but
his responses were no more than
brush-offs, aimed at appeasement.
He wrote, in response to my ques-
tions about getting a simple full traf-
fic stop at the crosswalks at Forbes
and Fifth by the Cathedral, that
Fifth Avenue is a state-run highway.
I take it as an insult to the students’

-intelligence‘ that the chancellor

would have us believe that for this

‘hand-waving explanation, we can-

not change a simple traffic light in
Oakland when the university has
changed the very skyline of Oak-
land, most recently with the hospi-
tal’s new buildings, often completely
stopping traffic for construction.

The university and the University,
Health Center have put Oakland on
the map. To leave some vague,

    
       
           

unspecified story that we “can‘t"
make the streets safer for students to

cross is to callowly admit that the I

administration does not “want” to
be bothered. Would it put such a
strain on our friends in the Oakland
Planning Commission or on the city
traffic bureau? Would we strain our
bank offavors with the city, after all
the university has meant to Pitts-
burgh? Up the street at CMU, the
students have their own full stop
walk-sign to cross from the dorms
across Forbes Avenue. What on
earth is the chancellor saying? That
CMU students can cross Forbes
safely, but we can’t cross Forbes to

Hillman? Do they deserve protec-

tion more than we? So what if Fifth
Avenue is state-run; what about
Forbes? The chancellor, in his letter,
made the almost satirical comment
that we could see his concern for the
students’ safety by the blue railings
they put up along Fifth.

The university administration is
quick to embark‘ on projects for the
students’ good, when it involves

-multi-million dollar construction

projects, like the new hospital and
student union work. They can sign
zilliondollar contracts with DEC &
AT&T, but the little things that
make a college a real campus go
undone. The chancellor could easily
have shown up at some of the engi-
neering week activities or games, for
instance.

Just change a little switch in a.traf-
fic box. That simple action is all they’
need to do to assure our students the
same safety crossing streets as they

 

have at the museum on Forbes and
up at CM U. No more of these pho-
ney, insulting excu'ses. I can’t under-
stand how the situation is not a
source of acute embarrassment to all
the Pitt administration. It is ridicu-
lous in the extreme. For less than it
would cost to build one floor of the
new “Emerald City of health care,“
we could have a safe, inexpensive
pedestrian bridge from the student
union to the Cathedral, where thou-
sands of students cross each day
with nothing but white lines to stop
impatient motorists.

Everyone I know loves the new
game room in the student union and
no one is more proud than I am of
The new cancer center. Under Craw-
ford, Kurtzman and then Posvar,
Pitt has made tremendous advances
over the last few decades to become
one of the greatest learning centers
in the country. Anything in the
world the student wants to learn,
from nursing to nuclear physics, Pitt
has a first-class program in it, and
even more importantly, he can get

hands-on experience in any field. It ,

is sad and altogether unbelievable
that our administration had let this
situation go on for this long. Pitt is
assuredly a big business for the
administration in terms ofhuge con-

tracts. But we students -are still the .

primary inhabitants of the univer-
sity. Don’t we at least deserve safe
passage to our classes? Without‘stu-
dents, there are no classes, without
classes no university, with no univer-
sity, no great “campus ofthe future.”

LQVT/dlsixiie dopes on punk

By Lisa Lavalle
Staff Writer

Liquid Sky may very well be
the most bizzare, far-out film
ever to be shown in Pittsburgh,
and on this premise alone, the
film is worth ‘recommending.
Although it is full of commercial
appeal — violence (sex), profan-
ity (sex), nudity (sex) and drugs
(sex), this new cult sensation is
not for everyone. It borders on
pornography. ‘

Liquid Sky explores the deca-
dence of new wave in New York
City, where punk signifies out-
rage and alienation. The punks
are driven to anti-social behav-
ior because of the cold, cruel
world around them. To them,
the outside world is materialistic
and immersed in fantasy. Unlike
the majority, who find comfort
hiding behind their money,
punks feel they must confront
the world realistically. They
refuse to conform to society’s
expectations; instead, they put

on their own magnificent perfor-

mance. They renounce the 9-to-5
look in favor of wild makeup,
bizarre hair and provocative cos-
tumes. However, their perfor-

. mances don‘t last long and often

end in suicide or overdose.

The story opens with the arri-
val of a UFO on a rooftop in the
Lower East Side of New York
City, facing the Empire State
Building. The next 36 hours are
shadowed for our punk—model
heroine Margaret and her sexual
partners by the alien inside the
craft. It seems the alien enjoys
killing people during orgasm
(Margaret is safe because she
doesn’t orgasm).

Margaret becomes a fatal
attraction for all the strange lov-

ers she encounters: Jimmy, a
burned-out junkie model; Owen,
a former teacher who lectures
her on immorality while craving
her body; Vincent, the actor who
rapes her; Paul, who craves
drugs because of his wife’s suc-
cess; and Adrian, her heroin-
dealing lesbian roommate.
Initially, the only person
aware of the UFO is a a West

Anne Carlisle plays a
dual role in Liquid Sky.

German scientist named
Johann. His search for the UFO
is often humorous, and it’s hys-
terical when he asks a friend:
“How can I study the behavior of
this creature if it‘s on private
property?” Soon, he solves the
dilemma and sets up his tele-
scope in the apartment of a sexu-
ally frustrated woman.

The scientist theorizes that the
aliens are attracted to Magaret’s
apartment because of heroin (for
which “Liquid Sky”is a euphem-
ism). However, the alien
becomes greedy and begins

feasting on the euphoria-
inducing chemical released by
the human body during orgasm,
which is related to heroin.

All these new-wave shenani-
gans are not totally unrealistic,
although most have been grossly
exaggerated to make the
audience laugh. Margaret has to
be seen as something more than
a freak; she has feelings just like
“normal” people. The audience
begins to feel for her as she bit-
terly recounts her path from
middle-class suburbia to new
wave decadenge in New York.

Anne CarlisIe’s contributions
as co-writer add authenticity to
the film, for she herself was born
in Connecticut and represents
the prototypical American
WASP of means of self-
expression. Carlisle also plays
the dual roles of Magaret and
Jimmy, androgynous, anti-
social new wave models. She is
brillant, and many people in the
audience are amazed when the
ﬁnal credits roll and reveal that

C she has played both parts.

Even the look and sound of
Liquid Sky are of a different
nature. It is interesting how the
colors inthe apartment change
with the development of the
story. The photography is mas-
tered superbly by Yuri Neyman,
and it is amazing how he man-
ages to make the Empire State
Building look like the world
largest hypodermic needle. Li-
"quid Sky is the first feature film
directed by Slava Tsukerman; he
also produced, developed the
score and co-wrote the film.
Tsukerman is a Russian emi-
grant who shows an innovative
and imaginative perspective in
the often bland world of Ameri-
can film.

1 fortable environment for
. according to Howard Hays, director of the
; New Zoo. “They have a chance to move
%about more freely and keep their claws
 down," -Hays said. “Their eating habits have

part of a four-phase renovation.

The successful transition from cages to
open air exhibits marks a new beginning in
Pittsburgh zookeeping.

The setting provides a healthy and com-
the animals,

changed because they’re more active now. If
the animal wants to climb a tree, go for a
swim, or sit in the sun, it can do so.“ ‘
Most of the zoo‘s 2,500 animals, Hays
said, were born in captivity and must adjust
to this new environment. The African white
rhinoceros, the second animal to be moved,

was released to its exterior area with ease. \ . v A

 

But when the rhino saw the tall grass sway-
ing in the breeze, it became terrified. lt was a
sight -he had never seen before.

“H ow else would you react," Hays said, “if
you were cramped in a room with iron bars
and concrete ﬂoors — a very sterile exhibit?“

’Many more animals will soon be relo-
cated. Phases three and four of the construc-
tion will allow other large animals native to
Africa, and tropical primates, to move
outdoors.

The Pittsburgh Zoo hoped to undertake
this $15.5 million refitting project 25 years
ago. “We just didn’t have the money then,“
Hays said. “We’re very happy that Mayor
(Richard) Caliguiri made it possible to get a
group of public-supported, spirited people
together to come up with some private
moneys to spearhead this project."

The primary public support group,
Friends of the New Zoo, is attempting to
raise money for the tropical house. “Thus
far, they have managed to contribute about
$5 million,“ Hays said.

The New Zoo is also funded by the City of
Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and the state
and federal governments.

Admission fees raise about $900,000 for
the zoo annually, Hays said. This helps to
curb the zoo‘s S l .6 million operating budget,
but does not cover capital improvements.

The changes in the Pittsburgh Zoo were
not made to benefit the animals only. The
Seattle firm of Jones and Jones designed the
exhibits to help bring people into closer con-
tact with the animals — both physically and
mentally. . -

The animal exhibits are displayed in what
Hays called “landscape immersion" style.
“The idea,” he said, “is to make people feel
that they’re actually going through a temper-
ate forest.”

The illusion is enhanced by the surround-
ing foliage of hawthorns, ailanthus, and
other plants used in the lion and leopard
displays. Instead of planting acacia, which
could not survive in Pittsburgh’s climate,
horticulturists chose the local look-alike,
black locust. A ‘

Rocks made of gunite, a cement-like pro-
duct that is sprayed over a form of wire mesh
and sheet metal, were specially designed for
the exhibits. Zookeeper Margie Marks
explained that these rocks “are ‘hot rocks’
that heat up electrically when the tempera-
ture drops." They have been placed at the
best possible viewing sites in the exhibits so
the lions can be seen sitting on top ofthem.

Other special features of the exhibits
include moats that enable the animals to
swim and man—madc termite mounds, which
the animals use for scratching on.

Hays said, “Its much safer than the old
zoo. The cats were kept in barred cages, and
six feet from the public was a little three—foot
fence. The people could climb over that and
put their hands through the cage.

“In this new setting, the closest the public
can get to the tigers is 26 feet. To aid in this
separation. we used invisible moats and [vis-
ible] dry or water-filled moats."

At one time. zoos had one ofevery animal

species. “Now,” Marks explained. “zoos .

prefer to keep groups of a few different
animals for breeding purposes. We have two
rhinos, two elephants, four lions, four tigers,
and two leopards.”

The Pittsburgh Zoo no longer gets its
animals from the wild. “Mostof our anim-

. als,” Marks said, “were born in the zoo, in

captivity. We do have two elephants from
the wild, both orphaned, and two orangu-
tans from Sumatra.” It is possible to get
species from the wild, she said, but the pur-
chasing and shipping costs are extraordinar-
ily high. The zoo aquired one elephant in
July of 1982 for $18,000.

Today, most zoos get animals by trading

or sharing with other zoos. “We have breed-~

ing loans," Marks said. “There’s a program
called Species Survival Plan, comprised ofa
group of people who decide which zoo anim-
als should‘ mate. lt’s like a matchmaking
network. Our one male tiger, Nicholas, came
from Utica, New York to mate with our
female tiger, Sasha. Our other female tiger,
Sophie, is going to the Boston Zoo in I985."

Each animal that moved to Phase II of the
New Zoo was given a complete examination
by the zoo‘s medical staff. The examinations
for the lions and tigers included: teeth clean-
ing, eye examination, nail trimming; an elec-
trocardiogram, and other medical evalua-
tions. The animals were also groomed and
vaccinated.

During t-he moving process from old zoo
to new 200. the animals were introduced to
their open-air environments slowly and
carefully. Cage life formerly allowed no
physical contact, so the animals were used to
only seeing and smelling each other. Now,

Zoo management  
opts for the natural

America’s zoos have traditionally displayed their animal exhibits in
cages with concrete floors. Many of these zoo’s residents have, in fact,
never known life outside bars. 

Now, the trend in zoo management is to release these same animals
into more natural habitats where visitors can easily see them but in a
more realistic setting. . _ '

The construction of these naturalsurroundings and the feeding of
specialized diets ensure the animals’ well-being, according to zoo
specialists. _

Animal behavioralist Dr. Robert Hoage of the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C., believes the new zoo settings help to promote more
normal behavior in the animals.

“When an animal is alone in a menagerie-type collection,” he said,
“its behavior tends to be neurotic. It paces back and forth in its cage,
flipping its head. This is due to a lack of stimuli.”

The new natural habitat setting, Hoage explained, is designed to
provide the animal with exercise. The result is that the animal will
actually live longer than if it were caged or in the wild.

“They are healthier,” Hoage explained, “and they produce more
offspring.”

Larry Killmar, curator of mammals at the San Diego Wild ‘Animal ,

Park, agreed that zoo animals benefit from these open-air exhibits.
“In the Wild Animal Park,” he said, “the animals are more active.

They have better ﬂesh and muscle tone because they get more exercise.-

They don’t pace like the caged animals at the San Diego Zoo.”

The transition to these open-air habitats is expensive, and prohibi-
tive to many national zoos. While the newly designed zoos have been
welcomed by the public, far more than sentiment is needed to improve
zoo conditions. .

Improvements are under way in many zoos. Both the Pittsburgh
and National zoos are currently undertaking extensive renovation
programs.

The San Diego Zoo has begun work on naturalized settings for the
lions and tigers. 4

A balanced diet, like exercise, is important to the animals’ health.
At the National Zoo, attention is given to those animals which need
special diets, like the golden Tamarin monkey.

“For years, the Tamarin monkey wasn't doing well in captivity
because it was thought to be a fruit eater,” Hoage said. “It actually eats
leaves and small invertebrates. It needs protein.” The new diet was
beneficial to these primates. ‘

A daily diet of ground beef is provided for the carnivores at the
Pittsburgh Zoo. The meat is pre-packaged in ﬁve-pound bags by a
Nebraska firm. “Rosemary [the lion] eats two bags, or ten pounds of
meat a day," zookeeper Margie Marks explained, “and another lion,
Serpico, eats seven and a half pounds of meat each day. In the winter
time, our tigers eat up to four packs, or 20 pounds of meat, a day.” In
addition to a daily feeding of meat, the animals get bones and liver
every week. V

Special diets are more expensive to maintain, Hoage added, but
with the emphasis on natural surroundings for zoo animals, these diets
are more commonly used.

Zoo management has come a long way from the days of roadside
exhibits and cramped cages. However, the transformation is not yet
complete on a national basis. Zoos have terriﬁc educational and

‘ entertainment value. New zoos are making that possible on both sides

of the fence. *

Marathon man
Freedline takes a run F
at d.S.O|ympioteam  

Many of Pittburgh’s top marathon runners get together
every summer and have their own competition — the Turtle
Creek Olympics. Its most competitive event is, what else, the
ugly feet contest. ’

Marathon runners have some downright ugly feet. Even the

_ most expensive running shoes fail to protect their wearer from

the effects of nearly 140 miles of training each week. ,

For the past two years, Don Freedline, a Pitt graduate 
student in the physio-logy program, has won the ugly feet ‘
contest — feet down.

He claims he would not even be a candidate this year, even
though he has been working harder than ever this year. He will
run his third marathon of the year — the Olympic time trials -
Saturday in Buffalo with blister-free feet.

Those feet carried the 28-year-old Freedline to a 10th-place
finish at Apri1’s Boston Marathon. His 2:17.46 finish qualified
him for the trials, where the top three finishers ascend to the 4:)“

’ Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

Sacrifices are in order when setting sights so high. Freedline
had to abstain from last Sunday’s Sprite Triathlon in North
Park. He won the competition last year, even though he was

» still recovering from a stress fracture suffered in his left leg in a
A previous marathon.

_ During his recuperation, Freedline struck upon an exercise
program that resulted in an “accidental success.” Since he was
unable to run, he started swimming and biking to keep in
shape. ' T

While a marathoner in a triathlon hardly seems conven-
tional, Freedline insists North Park was a runner’s course. He
completed in a record time of l:58.4.

Freedline has since moved his training program into a phase
that facilitates long distance running. To qualify for the Olym- '
pic Trials, he shaved 17.1 seconds from his finish in last year’s
Boston Marathon.

His training schedule has come at the expense of his part-
time job, but Freedline continues with his classes. He has also
taken on an internship with a rehabilitation program for heart
attack victims. S 3,

Freedline’s training schedule is jam-packed with mileage. ‘
“You get caught up in this mileage thing,” he says. He alter-
nates his training pattern with fast days and slow days. Sun-
days have been his longest runs, of between 20 and 25 miles. A
typical day of training for Freedline includes a run of l0-l5
miles in the morning and another 5-7 miles in the afternoon.

While some marathoners change their diets before races,
Freedline doesn’t really feel it’s necessary. He favors added
natural sugars just before a big race, though.

Should he fail to qualify for the Games, Freedline remains ;
optimistic about his running career. “They say marathon‘:
runners reach their peak in their early thirties,” he says. ‘‘I
figure I still have a while yet.” i

The Intercollegiate Amateur
Athletic Association of America
track and field championships
held this past weekend at Villa-
nova University were supposed
to be an opportunity for the Pan-
thers and other participants to
improve on times and further
prepare for the NCAA cham-
pionships next week.

Instead, the meet resulted in
some disappointments, at least
for Pitt. Darryl Shepherd, the
sophomore hurdler, was the only
Panther to place in the top six,
and his time of 14.33 was far
below his personal high mark of
13.5, achieved at the Pitt Invita-
tional just a week earlier.

“We were running into the
wind,” Shepherd said, “and it
was the first time that I have run
trials, semis and ﬁnals all in the
same ‘day. I was fatigued by the

time the finals came around. I
don’t know, placing fourth in the
IC4A is something.”

Boris Pendergrass of Rutgers
placed first in 13.92, while Mar-
tin Booker (14.11) of Villanova

Carolina also beat Shepherd .to
the line.

and Craig White (14.23) of East '

“We have no complaints," said
Pitt head coach John Vasvary.
“[Shepherd] is getting expe-
rience. and although he didn’t
run his best race of the season,
you can't count him out.”

Senior Garland Brown also
ran a lifetime best a week and a
half ago when he qualified for the
NCAA meet in the 800-meter run
at the Cavalier Classic in Virgi-

 The I;C4A meet, however,

provided Brown with l disap-
pointment. He failed to reach the
finals in the 800-meters despite
running a time of 1:50.15.

“He was leading thoughout his
heat, but when the race turned
for home, four guys passedhim
on the inside,” Vasvary said.
“Garland just didn't run the kind
of race that he’s been running the
last couple weeks.”

Todd Colas and Tim Manes
ran in the 800-meter run, but
both failed to advance from their
trial heat. Colas placed sixth
(l:49.66) and Manes eighth
(l:54.20).

“We decided to run Todd in
the 800 because he’s been run-
ning the 1,500 so much,” Vasvary
said. “We figured that the shorter
distance would ‘be an
advantage.”

It didn't turn out that way.
John Marshall of Villanova won

Running on empty
Pitt speedsters falter at lC4A’s

the 800-meter run with a time of
1:48.32. ~.
The only other Panther partic-
ipant was freshman Jesse Mikell,
who competed in the 400-
meter dash. Mikell advanced to

‘the semi-finals when he placed

fourth (48.56) in the trial. His’
semi-ﬁnal performance, how-
ever, was below par. He placed
eighth with a time of 49.33.

“I think it would be safe to say
that the freshmen just ran out of
gas as the season went on,” Vas-
vary said. “They got a lot of
experience. I'm very happy with
the progress that they have
made. It’s a big transition to go
from high school to Division I. I
think next year, with the strength
and confidence that they will
build, you well see them begin to
show what they can do."

El E] D

This weekend, Brown and
Colas will be headed to Penn
State for the Jim Thorpe Invita-
tional. They will run the 800-
meter run against many of the
same competitors they faced at
the IC4A meet.

- Shepherd and Brown have
already qualified for the NCAA
championship meet, and for
Colas, the upcoming meet at
Penn "State represents his last
opportunity to do so.

Clyde Vaughan and Billy Culbert-
son, Pitt’s graduating senior basket-
ball players, have entered the real
world and ponder the job placement
programs awaiting them.

Vaughan, who could have played
in the Olympics for England, his
birthplace, will wait for the National
Basketball Association draft on
June 19, where he could go as high as
the second round. ‘

Culbertson also awaits the draft,
where he could be chosen in the late
rounds, and is considering a basket-
ball career in Europe. ‘

Vaughan said his choice to bypass
the English Olympic team, which he
could have made ,with the ease of a
telephone call, was an easy one.

_ “The NBA is more important to
me than the Olympics. If it were for
the U.S., it might be different, but _
playing for England doesn’t mean as
much for me,” said Vaughan.

“Most of the players on that team
are like me, in that they were born in
England but live in the United“
States."

Vaughan will participate in an
NBA camp in Chicago next Wed-
nesday through Sunday, in which
the nation‘s top 50 collegiate players
will show their wares for every coach
and general manager.

‘The 6-4'/2 guard will have to shift
to the second guard position in order
to stick in the pros, but Vaughan,
Pitt‘s all-time leading scorer, is very
conﬁdent.

“Clyde Vaughan can do anything
when he puts his mind to it," he said.

According to Kimball Smith,
sports information director for bas-
ketball, the next step in Culberts,on’s
basketball career is a tryout camp '
given by European coaches in the
next two weeks, then the NBA draft.

Boston U. President Silber:
Central America threatened

continued from page two

and military aid to Central America
and especially El Salvador.

Silber warned of catastrophic
consequences if the U.S. govern-
ment fails to heed the Kissinger
Commission's advice. He said com-
munist expansionism could spread
south to the Panama Canal and
Venezuela and north to Mexico.
“This would result in the U.S. being
overrun with 25-30 million refugees,
as well as forcing the government to
spend $50-100 billion to defend the
southern border.... We must act
now,” he exhorted.’

Much of what Silbersaid, how-
ever, was disputed in subsequent
interviews with several Pitt profes-
sors knowledgeable about current
Central American affairs. Political
science professor Cole Blasier said
the commission was only superfi-
cially bipartisan. “While there were
Democrats and Republicans on the
commission, they all tended to
represent a roughly similar point of
view,” he contended.

Keith McDuffie, professor of His-
panic languages and literature,
argued that “the commission is
merely a legitimation of Reagan’s
policies.”

S,ilber3s»oontention that the Sandi-
nistas and rebel groups in E1 Salva-
dor are closely linked to Cuba and
the Soviet Union was strongly chal-
lenged by McDuffie. He said Silber’s
claims are “unreal” and that “it’s far
more complex than that. What peo-
ple are looking for there is some kind
of social equality.... We’re making

Responding to Silber‘s charges of
repression and civil rights violations
in Nicaragua, McDuffie said, “l
can't imagine any more effective way

to make a government anti-
democratic than to have the U.S.
terrorize it by planting mines in its
harbor and threatening its very
existence.”

The best thing the United States
could do for Nicaraguan civil rights,
McDuffie said, is to leave them
alone. i

Silber‘s prediction about the
benefits that will follow from El Sal-
vador‘s recent elections was not
shared by Reid Andrews, professor
of history. He acknowledged the
complexity of the situation in Cen-
tral America and the difficulty of
establishing democracy in such a
traditionally non-democratic
society. As for the fairness and valid-
ity of these elections, he said, “Its
virtually impossible for leftist politi-
cal parties to participate. They do so
at the risk oftheir lives.... The results
of these elections are by no means
guaranteed. Its quite unclear what
could happen."

Andrews agreed with Silber that
peace must be obtained before any
significant social programs can be
set up, but he strongly opposes the
“bloody peace” about which he said
D‘Aubuisson is talking. “The
human costs are unacceptably
high,” Andrews said. “Furthermore,
it’s no long-term solution. It may
work for 10 years, it may work for 20
years, but these [leftist] movements
are going to be back again. The con-
ditions that breed them will remain
unchanged.” ‘

McDuffie believes U.S. policy in
Central America is “totally wrong-
headed and misguided” and will be a
disaster if notaltered. He rejects the
Kissinger report and instead sees a
longer-lasting solution as lying with
peace talks proposed by the “Conta-
dora countries,” which include Mex-
ico, Venezuela, Panama and Colum-
bia. “We should listen to [Mexican
president]~de la Madrid and allow

them self-determination."

In response to Sibler’s warning
that the United States could be over-
run with millions of refugees and
that an enormous amount of money
will be needed to fortify the southern
border if communism were to
spread to Mexico, Andrews said, “lf
I thought that such an apocalyptic
outcome were likely and if l thought
the ways in which they want to spend
money now would prevent that, then
I might be in favor of it, but this is

: highly exaggerated. *

Blasier said, “I think there is a
security question in the area, but the
issue is how best to protect U.S.
security —- and my own view is that
Silber doesn’t have the way. Neither
does the Kissinger report.”

’l’lth straight

ty’s salaries,” Student Government
Board president Ken Stram said,
“but as far as the [tuition] increase
goes, it's going to get worse. It goes
back to the state, and there’s not
much we can do about that.”

~ “It’s always possible for someone
not to be able to afford an extra-$450
a year not to come to school,” Mur-
ray said. “It would have been unreal-
istic not to assume that we were
going to have some increase in tui-
tion and to expect the increase
would have some affect on the size of
the class.”

‘‘I don’t know how much inﬂu-
ence a $200 increase would have on
students," Schulman said. “It
shouldn’t be a real hardship, but I
think it’s true that some students will
suffer from this.”

Undergraduates in the Schools of
Engineering, Nursing, Pharmacy
and Health Related Professions will
have to weather an even larger
increase in tuition — from $3,050 to
$3,350. Senior Diane Gyescek is an
industrial engineering major who is
hoping to come up with the addi-
tional money in time to pay her tui-
tion bill. ‘

“Our tuition is higher to begin V
with, and I’m putting myself
through school,” she said. “It seems
like every year [tuition] keeps going
up and up. When will it stop?”
