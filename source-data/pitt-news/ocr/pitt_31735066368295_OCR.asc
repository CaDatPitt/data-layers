Book Center:  
Is it theBest Buyfor Pitt Students?

x

By BRlAN BALK

When walking past an open"

window in the bottom of Holland
Hall one might hear screams like
this:

“What do you mean, you'll only
give me six bucks for “The Psy-
chology of Atilla The Hun’s Battle
Techniques?” I paid $21 when I
bought it brand new!"

It may still be worth $21, how-
ever, prices of textbooks drop
rapidly in the Book Center's eyes-
especially if the book is an out-of-
date edition.

According to Mary L. Bonach,
director of the University Book
Center, the standard policy is that a
used book will be bought back only
at one-half of the original price. If
the book's binding is broken or if it
is grossly marked in, the value may
drop even lower.

USED

four years on the average.

The Book Center raises the price
of the used book 75 percent of its
original value when they sell it
back to students.

“This is necessary," Bonach
said. “In order to retain the quality
and upkeep the equipment (such as
the new computer system), we must
make a profit.” .

The Book Center is owned and
operated by the university. Bonach

' stated that only one percent of the

gross profit is reinvested in modern
equipment. The remaining por-
tion of their profit is vented back
into the center to keep it a self-
supporting entity, she said.

It may seem that the Book Center
charges an enormous amount for
text books, but on the average it is
comparable or less than what other
college book stores charge. One
reason for the lower rate is that the
Book Center does not charge for
freight and handling.

“Penn State at McKeesport and
Carlow College both charge for
freight which increases the price of
the books," Bonach said.

The Book Center sells new books

BOOKS.

The Book Center will not buy
out-dated editions, Bonach said.
She added that publishers will

update an edition every three or ’

They also provide a six percent
sales tax reduction with proper Pitt
ID.

Other college book stores in the
area do not buy back books as read-
ily. Carnegie—Mellon’s book store,
for example, just started buying
used books this year.

Pitt students had an alternative

to the book store in years past—the
Alpha Phi Omega used book sale.
But the Schenley Hall renovations
temporarily ended this traditional
sale.

“I don't think Alpha Phi Ome-
ga's book sale was very much com-
petition for us," Bonach said. She
said that books were often priced
higherat this sale because the stu-

Ban On
Parties
Lifted

The moratorium against parties
in the dorms that was announced
last week by the Office of Residence
Life has been lifted, according to
Jay Nalli, president of_the Resident
Student Association. .

Nalli said the lifting of the
moratorium was announced last
Thursday by the director of ORL,
Jo Ann Woodson. He said Wood-
son thought this decision was the
best one to be made considering all
the circumstances. Woodson could
not be reached for comment.

Parties will be allowed in the res-
idence halls while the alcohol task
force is investigating the possibil-
ity of implementing new alcohol
policies in the dorms. 4.

Nalli said he is happy with the
latest announcement.

“They're (the administration)
really giving us another chance,"
he said. Nalli stressed that by act-
ing responsibility the Pitt students
can show the administration that
they can handle a new policy,
under the same guidelines, rather
than a completely restructured one. .

The RSA‘ is going to meet today
to form a committee to conduct a

_ random telephone survey of dorm

residents to get their opinions on
alcohol. Nalli said 400 students

'will be surveyed about their opin-

ions on Pitt's current policy, the
causes and effects of alcohol, ways
to look at responsible drinking and
alcohol education.

dents established the price, rather
than the publisher. “Many times, a
student will feel his book is worth a
lot more than it actually is.”

There is one consolation to sel- ..

ling your book to the Book Center.
If the price of the book increases
after it is bought, the student will
receive one-half of the new inflated
price.

HelpFor Geniuses

By LYNNE LACEY

Until recently, programs
assisting “uuderachievers”
were geared only toward stu-
dents on academic probation or
those in immediate danger of
failing a course. But what help
is there for the student who is
earning a 2.8 QPA but should
have a 3.8?

For the last five years, Dr.
Tom Schlesinger of Pitt’s
Counseling Center has headed a
10-week career and personal
cotmseling program for aca-
demically talented students
with SAT scores of 1200 or
higher, helping them to fulfill
their potential. ‘

“There wasn't much in the
way of help for those whose
grades weren't good because
they weren't learning what they

wanted or for those with good
academic scores, but who were
not enjoying it,” Schlesinger
said.

The program usually
involves between six and 12 stu-
dents. Applicants are inter-
viewed and chosen mostly
according to individual merit,
but considerationis also given
to their interaction as a group.

Run by two of the counseling
center's graduate student assist-
ants, Marquita Bedway, a career
counseling intern, and John
Haire, a career and personal
counseling intern, the program
has three components.

First is the counseling group,
which meets two hours per
week for all 10 weeks.

mal session, which allows the

Publication G iv e s
Undergraduates
a Challenge

By ERIC GLICK

Some academically serious
undergraduates find that their
required classwork leaves a lot
to be ‘desired. The books they
read and the papers they write
are often times not challenging
enough.

In order to offer undergradu-
ates a little more challenge, The
Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review was established in
October 1980. The magazine,
published in the spring and
fall, gives undergraduates from
around the country a chance to
have an original paper of an
analytical or research nature
published.

The Review is sponsored, in
part, by the University Honors
Program of Pitt, the College of
Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of

Arts and Sciences and the
National Collegiate Honors
Council.

The Review distributed to
over 300 universities around the
country, and students from
Columbia University, Hunter
College. Ohio Weslyan as well
as Pitt have had their papers.
published.

While the format of the
Review is quite simple the
standards for papers are high
and the publication procedures
rigid. Once it paper is submit-
ted, a panel of referees (corn-
prised of over 150 professors)
judge and evaluate each paper
on the basis of originality,
depth of research and clarity of
presentation.

Jurcic said that originality of
the papers is the most impor-
tant aspect. Each paper is usu-
ally sent to two referees, whose

 

-4

 

' ..L

 job it is to imikgeﬂcotnrneiits,‘cor-« — g  _

rections and constructive

criticism. -

The comments are then sent

back to the student, and with”

the help of the editorial board,
the student rewrites it utilizing
the comments and suggestions
of the referees and once again
submits it to the judges.

Jurcic said that hypotheti-
cally this process can repeat
itself until the work is consi-
dered to be of publishable qual-
ity. If the student's work is not

published, he or she still
receives a critique from
professors.

jurcic said that the Review
allows an "exchange of ideas”
between students that is very
important and often lacking in
modern education. He also said
that over 300 schools get to “see
what we think. Authors learn a
great deal simply through the
process of preparing their pap-
ers for publications.”

The latest issues of the
Review features a paper from a
Pitt undergraduate. The four
papers in the latest issue were
selected from a group of 30 and
the issue includes a guest essay
from the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Ireland, Garret
Fitzgerald.

The Review was founded by
Bob Pape in 1980. Pape gradu-
ated in l982 and is currently

working at the University of’

Chicago.

Of the works published each
fall and spring term. two per
issue are selected for the Edythe
Portz Prize. :1 cash award of$2.‘30
given to especially outstanding
essays. . ‘

“The Review is a service to
the students," Jurcic said. Writ-

,. ing is fundamental to anything

1>m‘h‘as seen many changes over
the years. At one time, the campus
consisted of only the Cathedral of
Learning and a handful of other
buildings. Now, mention Oakland
and most people equate the whole
section of town with Pitt's campus.

Savina Skewis, who has been
employed by the university for 37
years, has seen many of these
changes. She has worked under five
different Chancellors and said
“each seems to have been the per-
fect choice for his years.”

Skewis graduated from the Uni-
versity of Delaware with a B.S. in
home economics and received her
master of letters from Pitt. She
taught at both McKeesport and
Carnegie high schools and in 1946
took a position as dietician at Pitt.

In 1950, she became the associate
dean of women, and in 1965, she
became the dean of women. Rather

than having a separate dean for"

both menand women, the position
was changed, and in 1968, she
became the associate dean of
students.

Again, in 1970, Skewis took on a
new role within the university as
the director of the Heinz Memorial
Chapel and as adviser to the chan-
cellor. Currently, she is the adviser
to the secretary of the university.

Her role includes helping organ-
ize everything from mortar board
initiations to student—loan fund
raising.

Since 1946, Skewis has helped in
the planning stages of some of the
advancements made at Pitt. She
helped in the planning of Lothrop
Hall and the setting up of the
quadrangle for women. With an
architeck, she helped design the
kitchen on the twelfth floor of the
Cathedral.

She also had a hand in the organ-
ization of the resident assistant and
mentor systems. The dean of

women’s office developed these
programs.

“Staff members, including secre-
taries, met with a small group of
students every week to help orient
them to life at Pitt," Skewis said.

The role of women in the univer-
sity appears to be the greatest
change in the university as far as
the student body is concerned, she
said.

“Women have advanced in many
ways,” she said. “I never married_
and have a lot of freedom, but sin-
gle women today have even more
freedom than I do.” ’

Skewis entertains many people
in ‘her twelfth floor office. For
example, the Nationality Rooms
program will soon be interviewing
people for overseas study awards,
and Skewis will be the hostess for
the event.

She said that her office, which
resembles a warm study rather than
a business office, “provides a more
relaxing atmosphere for both the
students and the interviewers."

During these events, she pro-~~

vides a never-ending supply of tea
and coffee. “But those students sit-
ting in the ‘hot seat’ are usually too
nervous for refreshments,” she said
as she pointed to a red cushioned
chair across the room.

According to Skewis, there are
only two rules regarding her office.

“The first is that I‘m co-hostess
of everything.that_goes on in the
room. And if anything takes place
after dark, someone has to walk me
home.” *

Her office is also the headquart-
ers for the Women’s Association,
which was started in 1917 by the
wife of then-Chancellor Holland.
Its purpose was to bring the faculty
members together on a social basis
rather than a strictly professional
one. V -

“The women started the organi-

 

zation to bring their husbands
together,” she said. Today, how-
ever, female staff members and
faculty are both actively involved.

The group is also active in rais-
ing funds for student loans. This.
year, it is providing the funds by
organizing a used book sale toibe
held in Stephen Foster Memorial
Hall in February. «

Skewis has a very active schedul
at Pitt. Last week she hosted the
Mortar Board initiation, a meeting
with the Alumni Association and
an Alpha Sigma Lambda meeting.
She "alsohosted a reception for the
families of the Heinz Chapel Choir
following a performance. \

Governor Dick Thornburgh
recently named Skewis as one of the
Distinguished Daughters of
Pennsylvania.

Skewis said she enjoys working
with the students in the twelfth
floor cathedral kitchen because it’
helps students “get to know one
another across academic lines.”

Alumni have also returned with
their families to cook or make
candy with her.

“It’s important for students to be
able to return to the university and
find that the university is still inter-
ested in them,” Skewis said.

Part of her reasoning involving
the candymaking is “while good
nutrition'is important, we need
some frills now and then."

Skewis works directly under the
secretary -of the university. Her
informal assignment is to do any-
thing that comes along if she wants
to do, as long as it’s for the good of
the university.

“The most important part of the ‘
university is the students,” she
said. “Therefore, I work with them
on an informal basis.”

“I don't deal in the negatives,
there are just too many positive
things about life.”

Moratorium  

‘An injustice was almost inflicted on Pitt students
this term. The Office of Residence Life (ORL) tried

to strip students—of legal drinking age-—the right to '

drink in their dorm rooms; rooms that they pay for.

ORL director Jo Ann Woodson announced last
week that there would be a moratorium against all
parties (and possibly against all alcohol) in the
dorms while the alcohol task force pondered over the
old policy and discussed the possibility of imple-
menting an entirely new policy.

Nobody can say for sure what caused Woodson to
change her mind on the moratorium, but one thing
is certain; it was not because of pressure from the
student body. _

No matter how much it hurts to admit it, Pitt
students do not have a very loud voice with the
administration. They sit on committees and attend
important university functions, but the students are
nothing more than figureheads to show the world
that Pitt is a democratic university. ,

Case in point: when the Office of Student Activi-
ties was kicking around the idea of forming the
alcohol task force, it was done without any student
input whatsoever. Sure, it was just in the planning
stages, but students should have been used as a

soundingfboard. After all, who knows what’s on the ‘

minds of. the average student better than other
students? '

Even when ORL announced the moratorium,
there was really no student involvement in the deci-
sion. The Resident Student Association could have
been asked to become more involved in the decision
by investigating what kind of impact it would have
on the dorm students. ORL is lucky that there were
not riots in the Quad. 0

All this goes to show that students’ thoughts, ideas
and opinions really don’t carry much weight where
the-adminstration is concerned. .

It would be very easy to blame the students; every-
one’s apathetic these days. But the blame for this one

Salvadoran Violence

Dear Editorzi

Once again in January of 1983,
President Reagan will “certify” to
Congress and the American people
that there are no human rights vio-
lations in El Salvador.

Such “certification”-
announced after Mr. Reagan’s last
disappointing , trip to Latin
America—will be delivered by the
president himself. It constitutes a
false and misleading statement that
violates the trust placed by the
American people and our Consti-

tution in Reagan and his office_._ _7

Since President Reagan was
elected in 1980, everyofficial report
published by U.S. church groups
and internationally recognized
organizations has confirmed that
violence by the government of El
Salvador has increased.

Ironically, since Reagan’s last
“certification” of August 1982, the
effect of U.S. aid—-including the
training of a 1,000 man “special”
Salvadoran force in the United
States, an increase of military
advisers as well as millions of dol-
lars in military aid—has been a
sharp increase in civilian deaths.

Second Largest Jail

For the Reagan administration,
this certification is a necessary step
to justify a $500 million-plus pack-
age of‘ military aid to El Salvador
for the first six months of 1983.

Such an amount of money and
its intention is a slap in the face of
millions of unemployed
Americans.

As in Vietnam, government vio-
lence in El Salvador has increased
proportionally to U.S. military
involvement reaching more than
30,000 civilians murdered since
Reagan took office.

Presently, more than 1,000 peo-

jple per month show up in the

streets of El Salvador murdered and
horribly mutilated. In El Salvador,
this violence is maintained and
dangerously increased by the Uni-
ted States g'overnrnent’s stubborn
unwillingness toaccept the justi-
fied will of the Salvadoran people
and its refusal to allow negotia-

Computer Plan Review

By RON BARBER

Today we have some good news
and some bad news. The good news
is that the administration has
decided to undertake a broad
review of its current three-year
computing plan, affecting compu-
ter services to Pitt students, faculty
and staff. Students, in particular,
stand to gain from the decision-
announced last week—to bail out

‘The administration of
this university is known
for nothing if not its size
and complexity. It takes
quite some time ' for
major decisions to clear
all of the “proper chan-
nels.’ ”

' of the current computing plan as

much as 18 months ahead of
schedule. ’
Popular scuttlebut has it that the
present computer system, based on
Digital Equipment Corporation
KL 10 computers, was obsolete
from the day it was installed. Not
only has this situation force tight
restrictions on student access to the
computers, it has seriously disad-
vantaged Pitt students who will
seek jobs in companies using more
sophisticated computers. These

V [)llI(‘I'

students can hope that Pitt will
purchase a new system that can
offer them more time on the com-
and more marketable
training.

Now for the bad news. We live in
a time of rapid advances in compu-
ter technology. While this offers
Pitt the chance to move ahead, in
terms of computing, of colleges
that bought computers only a short
time ago. it also sets a trap for an
institution like Pitt. The adminis-
tration of this university is known
for nothing if not its size'and com-
plexity. It takes quite some time for
large decisions to clear all of the
“proper channels.” A late decision
on a computer system in this cli-
mate of rapid technological
advancement could lock Pitt into
another out-of-date computing
plan. .

Pitt’s overblown administrative -

structure might be defended on the
grounds that it-allows for input
from students and faculty. You've
heard this argument before-
dernocratic ideals and’ all that.

_Unfortunately, the recent decision

to close Pitt’s geography depart-
ment (approved in the face of
almost unanimous disapproval by
the University Senate) bears wit-
ness to the faults in the “demo-
cratic administration” argument.
In any case, now is not the time
to argue about the evils of the
administration. Any decision on a
computing system, be that decision
goo, democratic or whatever, an be
spoiled by unnecessary delays. On
the other hand, a hasty decision
could be easily spell disaster.

‘Any decision on a com-
puting system, be that
decision good, demo-
cratic or whatever, can
be spoiled by unneces-
sary delays. On the other
hand, a hasty decision
could as easily spell dis-
aster.’

The moment demands a swift
and smart decision. Let us hope the
demand is not too great for the

administration to bear.

Socrates And Big Government

By STEVE PARKS ,

The black limousine came to a
halt at the busy intersection in
Washington, D.C., Socrates, seiz-
ing the moment, jumped from the
curb and began to wash the car's
windows, using his toga as a rag.
The tinted black window rolled
down to reveal a fat man, smoking
a cigar.

“Hey,” he shouted. “Get away
from the car, ya bum!”

“Just trying to make a living.
That’ll be two dollars for the win-
dow job,” Socrates said, hopefully.
. “Why, I wouldn’t give you two
dollars if you refinished the inte-
rior,” snapped the man.

“Okay, I'll clean the inside too,”
responded Socrates, leaping into
the plush car. Once inside he
noticed the crushed velvet seats,
mahogany bar and a Senate park-
ing permit. ,

“Get out of here!" the man

screamed.

Socrates stared at him for a
moment, then asked, “Aren't
you...

"s;~nhtm~ Phil 'r. Rich is the
name. Why, are you one of my con-

stituents?" he asked, suddenly
smiling.

“You might say,” replied
Socrates. “This is really nice
inside.”

“Thanks. I try to make a good
impression. After all, U.S. politi-
cians should be the envy of the
world, just like our country," he
added patriotically.

“But how can you afford this?"
Socrates said, gesturing with his
hand.

“We couldn’t, at least till the pay
raise."

“Pay raise! I thought the govern-
ment was cutting back?"

“We are, but congressmen have a

lot of expenses. For instance, when
the Russian ambassador comes
over, it's Russian vodka,” he

explained, pointing to_ the bar.
“When the German chancellor

an

 

comes over, it's schnapps..."

“But what happens when the
Columbian ambassador comes to
visit?" asked Socrates.

“Yes...well...Entertaining costs-a
lot, but we also have to keep in
touch with our constituents, that’s
expensive from Washington,”
sidetracked Rich.

“You mean with letters or trips
back home?"

“Yeh,” Rich signed, believing
that his friend had been convinced.

“But I thought congressman had
free mail and expense accounts."

“Well, expense accounts don't
cover everything!"

“Like those Gucci suits or
Cuban cigars," deduced Socrates.

“Exactly how much was your raise

anyway?"

“Only a measly 9.8 percent,"
Rich said humbly.

“That's only .2 percent below
the unemployment rate,” Socrates
noted. “Have you done anything to
lower unemployment? Possibly to
the rate of your pay raise?"

“I wassort of busy working on
the pay raise," admitted Rich

weakly, “But. next term I won't

have to worry about money so I'll _

look into the problem a little bit.”

“But it sounds like you really -

don’t need a raise as much as peo-
ple need jobs,” inferred Socrates.

“I'll see what I can do,” Rich
said, ignoring Socrates. “Maybe
I'll send a memo to the other con-
gressmen by my page.”

“How do you become a page?"
asked Socrates, hoping he could get
a job as one.

“My son applied at the main
office." ‘

“Your son is your page! What's
your wife, the chauffeur?” Socrates
joked.

“How'd you guess?” Rich said,
slightly unsettled.

“It seems to me you don't really
need a raise, what with your
expense accounts, free mail and the
jobs you’ve gotten your family.
You just think that you're worth
more than you actually are because
you waste a lot of money,” said
Socrates in a very calm voice.

“What?! That junket to Hawaii
was vital to national security,”
retorted Rich.

“Oh,” Socrates said, “Checking
the water for mines?"

“I try my best,” whimpered
Rich, “You should work for Stock-

Panthers NeedCase Study   

By scorr DELLETT

Amateur psychologists would
love to analyze the Panther basket-
ball team. For the majority of the
1982-83 season, it has been playing
rather listlessly, waiting for the
opponents to bow down to them-
after all, they are playing in the Big
East.

Soon after they got into the Big
East schedule, their overconfidence
turned into awe. The sights of
Tony Bruin flying in the Carrier
Dome with his two-handed dunks
off the alley-oop and Leo Rautins
with his magical passing touch
just overwhelmed the Panthers.
This was the big time—it was
Broadway instead of the summer
stock theater. ‘

Cheyney St. slowed Jennifer Bruce’s (12) scoring in the second half, allowing her 12

points overall.

\

Head coach Roy Chipman has
been pondering how to get the
team out of this rut. There's no
doubt that this team has talent—-
not enough to challenge the Big
East tit.le—but good enough to
show respectability.

After losses to Connecticut—a

team ranked behind Pitt in the Big

East coaches pre-season poll—and
Villanova, Chipman wondered
what he could do to get some
response from the squad.

They looked like a quality team
in practice, but when game time
came, they played like the teams in
the Atlantic 10. I

The Villanova game may have
added to Chipman's worries. After
keeping up with the Wildcats for
the first eight points of the game,
the Panthers fell apart. Andre Wil-

 

liams ventured into the valley of
the big man and came out with a
basketball in his face, compliments

- of Villanova forward Ed Pinckleyi

Williams, who has played.consist-
ent basketball for the majority of

the season, finished with two
points, 12 below his season
average.

The rest of the squad fared the
same way. Travelling calls, pass-

i ing the ball back over the 10-second

line and forced passes—these are
things many collegiate players
wouldn't normally do, but the
mystery of the Big East may have
caughtup with the Panthers.
“We were intimidated,” Chip-
man said after the Villanova game.
“Pinckney blocked a couple of
shots inside, and we became tenta-

Defeat

Lasalle; Lose To

By TAMMY ANDERSON

The Lady Panther basketball
team fell hard to a tough and quick
Cheyney State team yesterday at the
Fitzgerald Field House. Leading by
one poi.nt, 34-33, at the end of the
first half, Pitt was overwhelmed by
Cheyney and suffered a 97-56
defeat. The loss puts the 6 Lady
Panthers’ record at 9-6.

As in the past, the Lady Panthers
were strong in the beginning. Pam
Miklasevich, Jennifer Bruce and
Lynn Love dominated the boards
for Pitt and led the first halfs_coring
attack with,l2, eight and six points
respectively.

Rosetta Guilford and Yolanda
Laney paced Cheyney in the first
with 10 and eight points. Although
the first half wasclose, Pitt held the
edge, leading at times by as many as
eight points. Both teams experi-

. merited with defenses and presses

in the first, but one thing remained
constant throughout the game.
The offensive play of both teams
was very up-tempo and featured an
almost run-and-gun style of play.

Cheyney came out machine-
guiming in the second half, scor-
ing eight unanswered points and
holding Pitt scoreless for the first
two and a half minutes. Cheyney
keye(_l on Miklasevich and Bruce,
holding both to four points each in
the second half. .

Constant pressure and steals
enabled Cheyney to score easy
baskets. Midway through the
second half, Cheyney was up 66-42
aided by the scoring of Guilford
and liaiiey. F he Lady Panthers
remained behind Cheyney
throughout the rest of the game.
Pitt got few rebouiids—most of
which came from Bruce--and
scored very little during the second
half.

Clheyney came ‘into the game,

 Cheyney State

\

well rested. On the other hand, the
Lady Panthershave been playing
quite often since the end of the fall
term and may have been too tired to
keep up with, Cheyney’s quick
style.

In another game Wednesday
night at the Fitzgerald Field
House, the Lady Panthers captured
their ninth win of the season,
defeating LaSalle’s Lady Explorers
85-69. '

Although LaSalle had
players standing at 6-7, 6-3 and 6-2,
Pitt had little trouble controlling

the entire game and gaining the_

victory. The Lady Panthers led the
entire game and only at a fewﬂtimes
did the score even get close. A
tough 2-3 defense, full-court pres-
sure and good rebounding helped
the Lady Panthers dominate the
game.

“I expected’ LaSalle to be
tougher and the game to be closer,”
said senior forward Miklasevich.
“We kept pressure on them and
forced them to play our game. We

‘played well tonight.”

“In the past we had several diffi-
cult times with LaSalle, but we
handled them. well tonight,” said
head coach Judy Saurer.
“Tonight's game was a good team
effort, but Jennifer (Bruce) and
Pam (Miklasevich) stood out and
had especially good games.”

Jennifer Bruce was the game's A

leading scorer, tallying 29 points
followed by Pam Miklasevich, who
contributed 20 points.

From the opening tip-off, Pitt
gained control of the game by
jumping out to an early 6-2 lead in
baskets made by senior Lynn Love
and sophomores Becky Maziarz

and Rhonda Gibbs. Pitt’s tough‘

-man-to-man defense gave the
Explorers. more trouble‘ than they
could handle at the beginning of
the first half. _ _ - ‘ "

Gymnasts Emerge Victorious lncompetitions

Panthers

 Squeak 

Out Win

By BRIAN BALK

Despite “questionable" Midwest
judging, the Panther gymnastics
team opened its season with a dual
win over University of Illinois Chi-
cago Circle and Western Michigan.

“I thought that we were grossly
errored in judging," head coach
Frank D'Amico said. “Chicago was
overscored in almost every event.
We were definitely underscored
consistently. I don't know. Maybe
it is just the way they judge out
there.”

The Panthers edged out their
opponents scoring 254.7, over Chi-

’cago's 253.5 and Western Michi-

gan's score of 242.7.

“I knew even before the meet
began that it could go either way,"
D’Amico said.

' The Panthers were led by senior

Chris Femiani, who captured first
place in both the rings (8.8) and the
vault (9.5).

Other top performers for the
Panthers were junior Dave Smith
and freshman Matt Peters. Smith
and Peters placed first and second
on ‘the floor exercise, scoring 9.3
and 8.95 respectively.‘

D'Amico attributed the Panther
win to the powerful ring unit.
According to D’Amico, the rings
were the turning point in the meet.

Another event which D’Amico
was pleased with was the high bar,
an event which has troubled the

‘ Panthers in the past. In this meet,

there was hardly a trace of mis-
takes. Junior Frank Kratz led the
Panthers on the high bar, scoring
8.6 which was high enough for a
second place finish.

But it _ was persistent, unfair
judging that bothered D’Amico
throughout the competition-.

“We really did some fine rou-
tines, but rightfully didn't get the
score .we deserved,” D'Amico
maintained.

D'Amico said he noticed many
“flagrant violations” of gymnas-

tics rules. “For instance: thejudges
stated before the meet that each
gymnast must be in the vicinity of
the apparatus prior to his perform-
ance or else a two-tenth deduction
would be issued. But I saw Western
Michigan violating this rule

numerous times without a
deduction.”

Last year Chicago Circle was
ranked l6,in the country. D’Amico
said that this win is beneficial, but
it may not boost them in the rank-

ings because team scores—not

Record 

After surviving a quad meet at
Trees Hall on Friday, the Lady
Panthers gymnastics squad placed
first, but at the expense of all-
around gymnast Kristy Pieters.

Competing against Pitt, which
scored l63.7 points, were Maryland
(l57.l5), New Mexico (154) and
Michigan (£135.45).

In the individual events, Babbie
Flock scored 8.95 in the vault, fol-
lowed by Jackie Calderone with
8.65 and Karen Martin with 8.5. In
the uneven bars, Martin tied New
Mexico’s Chris Riser with 8.8.
Flock scored 8.65 in the same event.

On the balance beam, Martin.-
placed third with 8.25 points, with
Flock following at 8.15.

When the all-arounds were tal-
Jennifer Huff
scored first with 34.45. Flock regis-
tered second with 33.9 points with
Martin's placing at 33.65.

Pieters came in fourth with 32.4
points but will not compete again
for four to six weeks. She sprained
her knee on her last pass in the
floor exercise-

Overall, "Lady Panthers coach
Donna Sanft was pleased with her
team’s results.

“It was a good meet," she said.
“We were surprised a little bit at
Maryland and Michigan...(J..
thought the score would be a litt'I‘;
closer.” A

Undoubtedly, vaulting was
Pitt's strong point in the quad
meet—one facet that is continually
being refined.

Said Sanft: “Vaulting was our
best. Babbie had a mental coine-

- back this year. She has got together

her physical and mental talentjust
this year.”

Since her last meet, Sanft said of
her 4-1 squad, “We are vastly
improved since playing New
Hampshire on the beam and bars.
We hit a lot better; it’sjust a matter
of getting more meets under our
belts.” .

The Pitt News, Monday January 17, 1983 . V _ _p‘aEe-9 ‘

Pitt In Need Of Psychologist

tive. A couple of kids caught the
ball, dribbled it once or twice and
gave it to someone else. There

wasn't anyone who wasn't
intimidated.”
That was reason enough to

worry. In a league where the big
man dominates, intimidation is
important. When a team is intimi-
dated, there is no way they can play
well.

Perhaps the turning point may
have been the West Virginia game

Saturday. For once, the Panthers.

took an early lead. For once, the
Panthers dictated the type of game
that would be played. And for once,
Pitt defeated a team that had some
respectability.

Maybe West Virginia should
have been up for the game—after
all, Pitt beat the Mountaineers in
the Eastern 8 finals last season and
the two schools are in new confer-
ences competing for recognition.
But Pitt showed its desire to win as
they opened with 12 unanswered
points.

Even ‘ when the Mountaineers
took a 53-52 lead with 8:27 left—a
sign that Pitt could be losing its
composure—the Panthers reco-

vered and sent West Virginia back
to Morgantown with a 81-67 loss,

» their fourth in five games. .
Of course, Clyde Vaughan and

Williams led the Panthers, but
there were some new heroes. Guard
Billy Culbertson had his best per-
formance of his Panther career,
scoring. 14 points and dishing out
seven assists while controlling the
tempo of the game. If Culbertson,
George Allen and Joey David con-
tinue to improve, the guard posi-
tion should become an asset rather
than a liability.

Another player who contributed
was forward center Trent Johnson.
Johnson, who stepped in after the
Connecticut game and eased some
of the pressure on Vaughan and
Williams, scored a career-high 16
points Saturday.

One could say that this is a typi-
cal Chipman team—start off slow
and have a bad game which rallies
the team for the rest of the season.
It’s hard to say how much the West
Virginia game will give Pitt, but
the Georgetown game Wednesday
should be a test. Will the Panthers
be intimidated by Patrick Ewing,
or will they continue to improve

and possibly knock off the elite of

the Big East? _
Only time will tell. But Wednes-

day’s game may answer a lot of

questions about the Panther bas-

ketball team.
¥= # * it II‘ # it =I< II‘ *

Gale Catlett has done it again.

-The man with his foot constantly

in his mouth made a big fuss before
the game when he argued about the
use of the 45-second clock. The
game was delayed nine minutes
until Pitt officials produced the
game contract which said the 45-
second clock would be used.

The West Virginia coach also
used other tactics which failed mis-
erably. Catlett had his team stay in
Morgantown until 5:30 p.m. Satur-
day afternoon. The team arrived at
the Fitzgerald Field House minutes
before the start of the game. The
long bus ride showed as West Vir-
ginia missed the first five shots of
the game.

Next season will be interesting,
when Pitt visits Morgantown. It’s
always humorous to hear what
comes out of Cat1ett’s mouth.

Runners Sprint Into NCAA ’s,, IC4-A ’s

By CHARLIE O'HARA , _
Spearheaded with ‘qualifying

_ performances by hurdler Roger

is..."

Kingdom and the two-mile relay

team, the Pitt track teain’s venture"

to the Eastman Kodak Invitational
at Johnson City, Tenn., provided
them with the big performances
which were crucial to a successful
season. ‘

In addition to Kingdom's school
record (7.21-) in the 60-yard hurdles,
the two-mile relay of Ga_rland
Brown, Terry Gallagher, Todd
Colas and Darren Geary placed
first, setting new meet and school

' records with a time of 7:24.41.

  L0

 

, Other Panthers also made names
for themselves this weekend. Rick
Asberry broke the school record in
the 60-yard dash with a 6.2 while
teammate Dwight Collins tied the

former record (6.3). Both qualified I

for the IC4A ("Intercollegiate Ama-
teur Athletic Association of Amer-
ica) championships. _

Along with Kingdom, Darryl
Shepherd also qualified for the
IC4A championships with a time
of 7.3 in the 60-yard hurdles.

The Panther mile relay con-
tinues to be impressive. The team
of Brian Pollock, Geary, Mario
Joyner and Gallagher raced to a

second conselcutive school record-
breaking performance (32133),

-qualifying them for the IC4A

championships. .

The list of Panthers who have
qualified for the NCAA champion-
ships has grown to six. Sixteen

members have now qualified for

the IC4A championships.

Each meet has brought marked
improvement, and with this
improvement has come the confi-
dence that may make the Panthers

. the power that many believed they ’

could be when John Vasvary took
over as head coach.

Pitt continued to play aggres-
sively by pressuring the LaSalle
offense, and by the end of the first
half, Pitt had a 39-35 lead, mainly
due to the scoring of Bruce and
Miklasevich. LaSalle's Sue
McCaffery and Gine Tobin kept
the Explorers in the contest with
their effective shooting. This half-
time score was as close as ‘the
Explorers got to Pitt. _

After leading by 10 ‘points
throughout most of the game, the
Lady Panthers exerted a full court
pressure on the LaSalle offense and

broke the game wide open. Steals ‘ ‘ ,

by Gibbs and freshman guard Kim

Gannis lead to easy Pitt baskets.
