Alumnus: Rising biofuel pricesoffer hope for world’s poor

by Mike Macagnone
Staﬂ Writer

There are nearly a billion peo-
ple on the planet without a secure
source of food, and the production

A of biofuels threatens a jump in that

number, said a legal adviser to the
United Nations.
The issue surrounding bioﬁiels

is further complicated by envir0n- .

mental considerations and a world-
wide desire for energy security, said
Victor Mosoti, who works for the
director-general of the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.‘
Mosoti, a Pitt Law School alum-
nus, gave the 17th annual McLean
Lecture on World Law Tuesday
night, discussing increased biofuel

production worldwide.

Bioﬁiels are a recent ‘develop-
ment in renewable energy produc—
tion. Derived from corn, sugar
cane, palm and soybean oils, they
are‘ used to replace fossil fuels for
energy needs, he told the people
gathered in the Barco Law Build-
ins ' . . .

Biofuel serves as an alternative
to fossil fuels for many nations.
They are often more economical
than oil for transportation, and
burning biofuels might reduce
carbon_ emissions. The reduction
might be as much as 87 percent
for bioethanol and 78 percent for
biodiesel, said Mosoti. .

Biodiesel and bioethanol are th

two major sources of biofuel in _

developed countries.

In the past few years, an increase
in demand for biofuels has resulted
in an increase in their production.
Because of this, 1 percent of the
world’s arable land has now been
converted to biofuel production.
by 2050, 20 percent of the world’s

biofuelproduction, said Mosoti.
This jump in biofuel produc—
tion has resulted in increased food
prices worldwide, with dairy prices
increasing the most. Higher food
prices put people with lower or
nonexistent incomes at further risk
for starvation, said Mosoti. . '
The possible effect of that 20
percent loss of arable land on food
prices is not yet known, he said.

The United States has tried to ‘

protect domestic biofuel produc-
tion by placing a tariff of 46.5 per-

cent on imported bioethanol and

6.5 percent on irnpdrted biodiesel,
said Mosoti.

senior year.

This will allow students to pursue intern-
ships, which will give them a glimpse of the
careers they’re working toward, early in their
undergraduate careers. Some students will ﬁnd
out they love the jobs they’re preparing for, but
others will find that they desperately need to
switch their goals.

Heddleston, one of Finlay’s colleagues.
Heddleston once had to advise a student

who discovered during his senior year that he

didn’t want to enter engineering after all.

“He was looking for a job that didn’t deal I

with the engineering” side of ‘engineering +
maybe the business side,” said Heddleston.
“He had .some difficulties.”

Pitt senior Lauren O’Leary is one of the

many students wishing she’d heeded Finlay’s

and Heddleston’s advice.

O’Leary, who’s double majoring in com- _

munications and political science, with a minor
in Italian language and literature, sent out about
20 to 25 applications. ,
Overall, she said in an e-mail, she’s content
with the way her job search has progressed.
O’Leary had interviews with two public rela-
tions ﬁrms -- she’d like to work in an inter-

I ‘national public relations agency focusing on

issue advocacy —— and she’s grateful for those
opportunities. I

But she feels she could be in an even better '

position if she had planned further ahead.
“The worst mistake I made was probably
starting so late and not  myself enough
time to properly ﬁllout some internship ap-
plications,” she said. “Because I did not give
myself enough time on an application or two,

_ I was not able to send it in, and so I lost out

on that opportunity completely.”

' .“That being said,” she added, “I spent last
‘ summer working three jobs -— an unpaid part-

time internship in New York City, a waitressing
job at one restaurant and a hostess position at

another restaurant.” «

Heddleston said the only new piece of ad-
vice he’d give to students seeking jobs and

internships is to ditch the “boiler plate” resume »

and cover letter 4 ones that can be sent to mul-
tiple locations and often feature generic phrases
like ‘_‘To, Whom It May Concern” — and tailor
their applications to each company.

“Two years ago, you probablylcould have
gotten away with that because jobs were in
demand,” said Heddleston.

But today, Finlay explained, many employers
think, “If you can’t research me, why should I
invest my time in you?” , I

Finlay and Heddleston said it’s important
for students to have the right attitude while
searching for a job. The most successful job
seekers, they said, are  topconsider all of
their options - « I

Many students, Heddleston said, come into
the Office of Student Employment and Place-

ment Assistance and say, “Uh, it’s April I’ve
gotta do something ’ '

“And then they’ve got such lofty, unrealis-
tic ideas,” said Finlay Heddleston nodded ‘in
agreement _ .

Students delay jobs,

Jobs, page 4
they can do different kinds of jobs with the
same degree. They might not be able to get a
job or an internship at a Fortune 500 company
right after college. '

Perhaps, they should shoot for an entry level
job at a local public relations ﬁrm. There’s no
one right answer, she said. It’s all about ﬁguring
out what ﬁts best for you. 4

Another option for students is graduate
school. -

It’s not unusual, Finlay acknowledged, to
hear one student ask another, “Are you going
to grad school?” and have the answer be, “Only
if I can’t get a job.”

To some, it might sound like an odd trade-
off: postpone a salary to  debt The average
graduate students incurs anywhere from $27,000
to $114,000 in debt, according to FinAid.org, a
Web site that offers ﬁnancial aid advice.

But for some, the trade-off is more than
worth it, said Finlay.

Some students use graduate school to 
higher level positions, she said, while others will
choose to work ﬁrst, as they try to ﬁgure our
what ﬁelds they want to specialize in. Still, others
might choose to pursue Teach for America, the
Peace Corps or other similar programs.

Sarah Tuke, a student at California Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, about 35 miles outside
of Pittsburgh, plans to combine some of her
opdons

Tuke, who will graduate with a bachelor’s
degree in Spanish and health science and ger-
ontology this May, plans to take a year off.

Shes applied for jobs in phlebotomy and
processing at two hospitals back in \X/yomiss—
ing, Pa., her hometown. Essentially, she’d draw
blood samples from patients so that they can
be tested for various illnesses. Working in a
hospital, Tuke said, would help her prepare for

. the nursing career she hopes to have one day.

To be safe, or as close as anyone can be
given the state of the economy, Tuke applied
to work at Starbucks, too.

“I’ve actually always wanted to work at
Starbucks,” she said laughing a little. “It’s an
easy way to serve people, which is what I’m

all about.”

Still, Tukesaid it’s hard not knowing what
she’ll be doing for the next year. Some people
in her hometown put subtle pressure on her,
she said. They compare her to other people
she graduated from high school with by mak-

_ ing comments like, “Did you hear so-and—so’s

working at [insert business here]?” or “I just
ran into so—and-so, and guess who’s getting
married?”

“They want to see me have a step-by—step
plan,” said Tuke. “I have big goals, but that’s not
enough for my parents and neighbors.”

After  the year off, Tuke hopes to
join the Peace Corp for two years. She hopes
that the Peace Corps will pay for her to eventu-
ally attend graduate school to become a nurse
practitioner. '

“I’m kind of glad I’m doing the Peace
Corps, because there aren’t a lot of jobs out
there,” she said.

And if she can continue to improve her
Spanish while she’s working for the Peace
Corps, she’ll have an advantage over the people
applying for the same jobs she is. 4

In some ways, Tuke said, that relieves her

of a different kind of pressure. Her friends
are applying for jobs now and, ‘_‘It’s not any
fun to watch them struggle, to see the hard
work theyfve done and then trying to ﬁnd a
job,” she said.‘

An added stress for Tuke is that she still
doesn’t have a job lined up for the next year.

“Naturally, I really don’t stress out that much.
My theme song is Bob Marley’s ‘Don’t Worry,”
she said. “I’m just kidding.”

But really, she added, “My faith is a huge
part of who I am, and I have faith that God’s

' gonna provide for me.”

Although this challenge is a

to address the deeper implications
that the tax has on our national
identity. ' V

First, it’s importantto recognize

_ The  Streetjournal reported
in an editorial on Jan. 13, “Doug-
las Holtz—Eakin, the former Con-
gressional Budget Ofﬁce director,
estimates in a new study that the

‘ economy would create roughly 1.3

million more small business jobs

’ with no death tax rather than with

a 45 percent rate.”

Perhaps theniit’s nocoincidence
that Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.,
who co—sponsored the reduction

in the estate tax, is from a state
where more than half of all jobs
are created bysmall businesses.
Lincoln said, “If we reform the
estate tax, [small business people]
will invest in their businesses and

_ create. more jobs.”

A report of the U.S. Congress
Joint Economic Committee ‘re-
ported in 1998, “The estate tax
violates the basic principles of a
good tax system: It is complicated,
unfair and inefﬁcient.”

The Pitt News 0 wvvw.pittnews.com

But what troubles me more than
the fact that the tax is inefﬁcient
and harmful to the. U.S. economy
is that the tax, like Congress rec-
ognized, is deeply “unfair.”

jThe tax, like others with the
same agenda of wealth redistri-
bution, is a punitive tax directed

‘against the successful andvindustri-
' ous. ' ’ '

The only morally justiﬁed tax .

is one that serves the individual’s
interest, which servesthe defense

of this nation or the maintenance
of public works used by all. Any
other use of taxes constitutes a
theft perpetrated by the govern-
ment to serve the mob.

It is this mob that clamors at the

, polls for more and more handouts -

and calls for the ﬁnancial lifeblood
of the successful.

It is the mob that enforces these -

taxes with its votes in every elec-
tion while seeking more and more
undeserved beneﬁts.

ovide beneﬁts, not safety nets  

' The conﬁscation of private
wealth to gratify the desires of the
unproductive is slowly gnawing
away at the roots of this Republic.
Before any more damage is done to

the fabric and identity of this na-
tion, it is imperative that the estate

tax be discontinued, that the top
half ceases to support the bottom
half and that the young cease to
bear the burden of the elderly.

To the Editor,

For the sake of maintaining the opendialogue that Steve Kaszycki promoted in his
letter to the editor in the April 13 issue of The Pitt News, and as a woman whoidentiﬁes
with the queer community, I cannot remain silent. Both Kaszycki’s and _]effiAbraham’s
letters presented myths about the institution of marriage and the abilities of ‘gay and
lesbian couples to procreate as fact. . . P

Simply put, marriage might not appear to be a right for heterosexual men, but it has
always been a ‘right and source of A social and legal beneﬁts. for women who have been

‘historicallyand systematically denied rights and privileges. Historically, women married
in order_ to receive rights such as therability to own property and care for their children. V

Kaszycki and’_Abraham argue, from their heterosexual rriale standpoints, for the traditional
procreative purposes of marriage. But this promotionof the assessment that marriage
is not a right is simply away to defend homophobia. V A
Theissue here is not semantics, the very untrue notion that gay and lesbian couples can’t
procreate or faulty deﬁnitions of progress. The issue is a deep set belief that LGBT people
don’t deserve ‘a right to enjoy the ups and downs that all married people experience.
Abraham is correct in saying that not all change means progress. However, this is not
an issue of progress combating tradition, 'but rather the manifestation of our cultural

fear of “others.” I say it is time we recognize the privileges we are granted as brought to 
“us by our sex, race, class and sexuality and admit to the injustice in actively denying those. _
same rights to other citizens of this country. Instead of waiting, to see what history tells

us, like Abraham calls for, let’s make history and collectively reject the hateful notion that
queer people don’t deserve the same legitimacy as straight people. I"

. To the Editor,- ' V ‘

I Admittedly, in a culture that gives little thought to sin and its consequences, the
Roman Catholic Church’s teaching on indulgences might seem bafﬂing or nonsensical.
This being said, it is certainly fair that an article would be written _about the Church’s
practice of ‘granting indulgences and that this practice would be examined critically
in light of its theological and biblical foundations, as well as the historical abuses and
misunderstandings of the practice. S . ‘ - ‘ A

Yet, the column written by Dave Beitzel on April 2, “Vatican indulges self, sinners,”
did none of these things. The one Catholic resource that Beitzel mentions, Catholic.com,
provides a well—developed explanation" of the teaching as well asan insightful section
on the most common myths about indulgences. Beitzel either failed to carefully read
or intentionally ignored the Web site’s explanation. Of course, there are many other re-
sou.rces‘Beitzel could have used, notably the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church.
He could have alsfi interviewed the Catholic chaplains at the Newman Center or any of

. the priests at St. Paul Cathedral simply to clarify his understanding of the teaching before

writing his article. He did none of these things. Instead, he chose to mock the practice
of many faithful Catholics and grossly misrepresent Catholic teaching.
Among educated and devout practicing Catholics, it has now reached the level of a

‘cliche to remind ourselves that anti-Catholicism is the last form of acceptable prejudice

in the United'States. It _is unfortunate that The Pitt News lacks the capacity to distin-
guish between ‘what is provocative — writing that gives rise to thoughtful and spirited
dialogue -— and what-is inﬂammatory— writing ‘bent on insulting and offending the
reader. The Pitt News has been described as a “teaching newspaper.” At least in Beitzel’s
case, the paper miserably failed him and his readers. In the face of such a profound lack
of concern for accuracy and for’ disciplined well—ordered thought, perhaps the article
should have been entitled, “The Pitt News indulges self, writers.”

RENT

Benedum Center
April 14 through April 19
Call 412-456-6666 for tickets

Jacques C. Smith got caught in
the cliche trap.

“Carpe diem, you know, seize
the day and don’t count on tomor-
row,” he rattled off describing of
the theme of the musical“Rent,”
the Pulitzer and Tony award winner
that gave voice toithe ’90s.

The national tour that arrived
in Pittsburgh Tuesday isn’t a tired
cliche, though, despite its 13 years
in existence and oft—heard “No day
but today” tagline.

“The themes of this show still
resonate today,” said S'rnith, citing
the themes of homelessness, sick—
ness, hurting ﬁnances, love and life
as universal.

Rent follows an ensemble of
eight lovers and friends living in
the East Village of New York City
and dying from AIDS. It’s a pe-

— riod piece — complete with denim

shirts as costumes and payphones
as props — set “at the end of the

millennium,” as described in the

show’s 11 o’clock number.

‘Rent’ ” rocks into Benedum,

Belting out those words in
harmony at the Benedum Center
are original cast members Adam
Pascal and Anthony Rapp, who
play the songwriter Roger and the
ﬁlmmaker Mark.

Their characters are roommates,
evicted from the apartment that
acts as the show’s main setting by
their friend—turned—landlord Benny,
played-by Smith.

When the show first opened .

shortlyafter the unexpected death
of its writer, Jonathan Larson,
Rapp and Pascal were in their
mid-20s.’ H

They reprised their roles in
2005 in the movie version of the
show, and now" they’re back again
for this national tour. ~

“Rent” is old repertoire for '

Smith, too. He first took over the
role of ‘Benny from original cast
member Taye Diggs in 1997.
When asked how many differ-
ent signature maroon—with—a-blue-

stripe shirts he’s worn through the V

years, Rapp offered a cool, “Oh,
only three or four.”
Pascal, now 38, plays opposite

' 24-year-old Lexi Lawson as l\/limi, I

the Latina dancer and party girl
clad in black leather, lace and shiny,
stretchy neon blue pants. .

- “She’s brand new to the show,”
said Rapp, putting his arm around

Windows  will be tough for Nlicrosoft to sell

by Donald Campbell 

Columnist

. When it comes to selling Win-

_ dows 7, Microsoft has bigger prob-

lems than personal users. '
~ Computer users like you and me
are_all well and good, but most or-
ganizations in the software industry
make their money off their fellow
businessmen.-A _ ’
Businesses, even small ones, re-
quire large amounts of hardware
and software inorder to keep infra-
structure running smoothly.
Companies are also willing to
pour large amounts of money into
their computer infrastructure and
are therefore  to upgrade their
systems at a great expense. They
are only willing to do this, however,
when they sense a beneﬁt.
C Microsoft’s recent offerings in
the operating system market don’t
show great promise to provide ben-

' eﬁt to corporate customerslooking

to upgrade. . _ K
Corporate customers are still
shocked by the hailstorm of con-

 

  

troversy of Microsoft Windows
Vista. Windows 7, lVIicrosoft’s an-
swer to this hailstorm, can easily be

‘ perceived as yet another knee-jerk

reaction from a company desper-
ate to force its customer base to
abandon Windows XP.

’ As a result of these perceptions,
corporate customers will not ﬂock
to Windows 7 and will not begin en
masse investments in Microsoft’s
new operating system. The beneﬁt,
for most corporate customers, sim-
ply isn’t there. _ .

InformationWeek recently re-
ported that from a poll ‘of 1,100
business-grade computer ‘technol-
ogy buyers a “whopping 83 percent

_.of enterprises plan to skip the OS
5 its first year.” "

' The-true justiﬁcations for such a
disappointing initial prediction are
threefold. _First, Windows 7 is rather
‘expensive. To be fair, no Microsoft
foperating system can be considered
“cheap” at first glance.

Second, during an economic
downturn, businesses face the same
budget constraints as consumers —
and they know they can save money
by squeezing another yeariout of an

aging, but still performing, operat-
ing system.

Third, Microsoft Windows  is
reminiscent of Windows Vista and,
although Microsoft made massive
efforts to highlight differences and

improvements,‘ manyfear that Win-i
dows 7 will prove to pose similar

compatibility issues". * _
The corporate landscape is also
changing. Where ‘Microsoft was

at one time a leadieriin workplace‘

networking solutions, Unix and Li-

nux operating systems are 

footholds- - 1 i

Unix—based operating systems
are beginning to expand their in-
ﬂuence on the server market. 
already has a substantial share of
the server market, and the platform
to lose out in the coming years will
be Windows. ' ‘ .

_ a With the efforts of open source
initiatives, Linux-based architectures
that were once user-unfriendly are
now straightforward enough to be
used by non-technical employees

as a primary workstation operating

system.
Microsoft is simply losing out.
The major question that grips

many Microsoft diehards is whether
or not this move is quite fair.

s s ,
, Microsoft will have to do
an excellent job of convinc—.

ing industry Why it should ‘

invest large sums of money
immediately when the ,
system is fresh.
' 3??

Unfortunately, to a certain ex-
tent, Microsoft suffered from a form
of “too soon” syndrome with Vista.
Many will point out that Vista, for
many users, posed little to no com-
patibility issues.

The annoying habits and pop-ups
of Vista could be easily disabled and
the operating system truly did not re.-
quire staggering levels of hardware
investment to run efﬁciently.

Microsoft simply wanted every-

. one to upgrade before many people

were ready. _
Windows 7, displaying itself as
clearly more efﬁcient and less, let’s

say “emphatic” than its Vista cousin,
will still unfortunately ﬁght an uphill
battle against anti—Vista prejudices.

In the business world, where an

upgrade could mean millions and ‘

millions of dollars, even the slight-
est question can destroy an upgrade

effort. This tenuousness is ampliﬁed r

by the fact that, all  considered,
Windows XP was a very stable plat-

' form on which to base a standard

business workstation. .

Microsoft will have to do an
excellent job of convincing indus-
try why it should invest large sums
of money to upgrade to a system
immediately when the system is
fresh. '

Like any brand-new operating
system, Windows 7 is sure to include
its share of unforeseen bugs and
complications upon initial release.
Businesses are simply afraid that
these bugs will be ‘catastrophic, as
many perceive those experienced
at the outset of Vista were.

Microsoft will have to ﬁnd an
excellent answer to the old question.

The cast of “Rent" performs "La Vie Boheme," the full-cast number that caps off

Act Qne.

Lawson like he was her uncle welcoming her
into a circle of siblings at a family reunion.

Lawson, who left this season of “Ameri— -

can Idol” to join the touring cast, said she’s
“fulfilling her dream” of playing Mimi and
that she knew all of the musical’s songs
with the exception of one or two before
she started. ~

Besides Lawson and a few other cast
members, many of the cast members knew
one another from working on “Rent” years
before. They’re a close group, said Smith.

4 “Adam and Anthony are the big draws.
However if the rest of the cast didn’t pull
their weight, I don’t think people would be
as pleased as we’ve seen over the course of
time,” he said. _

“And I hope we don’t look like we’re all
10 years old,” he added.

Smith said even after all these years the
show’s' audiences on the road are usually

mixed with people who’ve never s.een-it live

before as well as long—time fans.
The Pittsburgh opening-night audience
was a warm one, cast members said, though

' it wasn’t as raucous as- in Los Angeles or

in Smith’s hometown, Chicago, the cast’s
"previous stop.  -
_“We’ve never had a city not ‘rnoo’,” he
said, referring to a song performed by Mau-
reen (Nicolette Hart) near the end of the first

act. She encourages the ‘audienceto. join in

and “moo” with her.

“When you feel the constant give and take
with the audience, it’s like a rock concert,”
he said. “We feel that energy. It’s a constant
dialogue. When know when people are clap-
ping, when people are laughing and when
they’re screaming.”

The audience Tuesday night, full of Ren-
theads — or fanatics of the show — “mooed”
on cue. They also offered screams of ap-
proval at the first notes of the show’s act
one closer, “La Vie Boheme,” for Maureen’s
ﬁrst appearance onstage and during original
cast member Gwen Stewart’s soprano solo
that rattles the rafters in the classic “Seasons
of Love.” 0

Supplemenijng these moments, Rapp’sl

vocals are crystally clear as ever, and Pascal’s
nasally rocker vibe still hearkens‘ back to the
original CD recording.

This reporter didn’t notice many people
singing along in the audience,despite their
willingness to “moo.” _ ~_ , ~

“\X/ould you hope for people to sing
along? If they can sing on pitch,” said Smith,
his growling baritone voice cracked into a
laugh. “I don’t'mind it as long as you aren’t
bothering the person sitting next to you. If
you all are vibing that way, that’s great.”

The tour was part of the PNC Broadway ,

Across America series and hosted through
the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

Kin er could be steal in later round

One ofPitt's leaders on the offensive endin the recent years, Derek Kinder
reooveredﬁ'omal<neeinju1yandislookingwwardthe2009NFLDraft

by Randy Lieberman
Seriior Staff W/riter

There’s always one.

Each year in the NFL Draft,
there’s always one player who be-
comes what experts call a “steal.”
This player is usually not the most
hyped, nor the most talented player
enteringthe Draft, but usually fol-
lows up a late-round selection _with
a stellar NFL career.

Former Pitt football player
Derek Kinder has all the makings
of a steal entering this year’s NFL
Draft.

Some experts have said the
6-foot—1, 210-pound receiver
doesn’t have the body to last in
the NFL. Others doubt the 2006
Biletnikoff Award semiﬁnalis't’s
knee is fully recovered from an
ACL tear back in 2007.

‘-‘I feel like sometimes even

though [my knee] could still be 100

. perc_ent,‘teams still could have that

in -the back of their minds,” said

_ Kinder. “And if there’s a borderline

decision between two players, they
could hold that against me. Hope-
fully it won’t come down to that.”

“Besides being a tremendous
receiver, he does some things that
a lot of other receivers don’t do,

' and that is block downﬁeld,” said

Chase Callahan, director of mar-
keting at Kinder’s agency,‘Rep1
Sports. “He’s very aggressive in
the run—blocking, and we’ve heard
comparisons to Hines Ward for
Derek. That’s what you don’t see
from a lot of the first— and second-

 

round receivers right now.”

Besides playing on the same
ﬁeld as Ward does with the Pitts-
burgh Steelers, Kinder is experi-
encing what the Super Bowl XL
MVP felt when he entered the 1998
NFL Draft.

Ward was a third-round selec-

tion, despite amassing the second

most all—purpose yards in Georgia

- Bulldogs history at 3,870. Ward was

critiqued the same way Kinder is
now, with SI.co_m claiming Ward,
“Is a great athlete, but may need
some reﬁnement at wide receiv-
er.” M ,

It seems that teams are taking
notice despite the negative criti-
cism.

Just this past week, Kinder said
he met with the Chicago Bears for
a tour of the facilities and a sit-
down meeting with general man-
ager jerry Angelo and coach Lovie

‘ Smith. Kinder addedithat he, “got

real good feedback from them.”
Kinder is scheduled to meet with
the Cincinnati Bengals this week.

Interest is always ‘a good sign

Penguins

by Sergei Feldman

Staﬁ’ IV/‘item

After struggling for several
months, a coaching change helped
turn things around for the Pitts-
burgh Penguins, who begin their
playoff run Wednesday night as the

‘J fourth seed in the Eastern Con-

ference against the Philadelphia
Flyers.

So, what are the key questions
awaiting the Penguins for another
trek to hockey’s prominent stage?

The Penguins have been one of
the hottest teams in the NHL over
the past two months.

Is momentum enough to ride

still facing

this’ team to a deep playoff run,
though? . _

Sergei Feldman: Momentum
alone won’t buy you a hot dog, much
less a deep playoff run. Fortunately
for the Penguins, they have talent,
depth and experience to comple-
ment the intangible commodity.

Like the prince of Bel-Air, the
Penguins are fresh. That happens
when you‘ cruise through four
months of a season like a senior
might in a ﬁnal semester.

Unlike other teams that «actually
played consistently well, the Pen:
guins have only played two months
of full-throttle hockey. Talent,
depth, experience and rest might

Greg Trietley: Yes, thanks to
interim head coach Dan Bylsma, the
Penguins have an unbelievable re-
cord in the final stretch. Pittsburgh
(surged from 10th in the conference
to contenders under its new coach.
This is "not the same team that
floundered its way to a .500 record
in the first half of the season.

Woods, Nlickelson still steal Nlaster

by Evan Burgos
Staff Writer

With all due respect to Peter King,

thereareafewthingsthatlthinkl
1. I think that everyone who tuned

into the Masters last Sunday cared a lot
more about the Tiger Woods and Phil
Mickelson   front-runners
Angel Cabrera, Kenny Perry and Chad
Campbell.

It’s true, Woods and Mickelson went
on a rampage during the ﬁnal round,
including a course—record 30 on the
front nine by  And _while the two
are the sport’s most famous, that fame
should not have trumped the three—man
playoff that ensued by Cabrera (eventual
 , Perry and Campbell But man,
Mickelson must have dropped at least
25 pounds —watch out Woods

2. I think Woods could play free
safety and out-bench press 25 percent
of the NFL ,

3. I think Plaxico Burress should be
suspended for a year from the NFL

Woods can out—bench.

4. I think Dwayne Wade should get
votes for the NBA Defensive Player of
the Year Award. He is a 6—foot4 shoot-
ing guard who is averaging 1.3 blocks
a game Not only that, but Wade has a
permanent spot on SportsCenter for
his recent  rejections So maybe
he isn’t anchoring a defense in the paint, '
but he is providing energy and pumping
adrenaline into his teammates with his
theatiics and amazing-ness Something
should be said for that Oh, and he is
second in the league in steals, too.

5. I thinkit’s abadidea fortheNFL
to consider its regular season
to 18 games. Granted, the league has
experienced success every time it has

r 
 

I think [Tiger] Weeds

and out—bench press 25
percent of the NFL.

lengthened the schedule in the past —
from 12 to 14 to 16. But by cutting the
preseason schedule and adding games
that count, you just assure more injuries
and less player development And for a
league with no real professional feeder

‘system and completely obsessed with

protecting its players, this just .doesn’t
make sense Regular season games in
August? Really? .

6. I think I’m sick of all the racially
and corporeally founded comparisons
of‘ basketball players. Like Hasheem
Thabeet will be the next Dikembe
Mutumbo Or Blake Giifﬁn reminds
you of Carlos Boozer Some similatities
exist, to be sure But there’s no doubt
its knee—jerk.

Remember when Adam Morrison
was the next Larry Bird?  Bird’s
pro career he averaged 24 points, 10
boards and 6 assists per game Since
Mori1'son’s NBA career is negligible at
this point, we’ll look athis 19 points and

Morrison was a great scorer, but

pre—Draft nerves  

. Kinder, page 12

' \\‘\

Former Pitt receiver Derek Kinder could be a second-day selection during this year's NFL
' Draft. Kinder posted a 40-yard dash time of 4.46 seconds during workouts.

Michael Heat Photo ditor

takes is one commitment to secure him a
roster spot in the NFL.

‘‘\With these trips, he can. really make these
teams fall in’loVe with him,” said Callahan.
“All it takes is one team to like you, and that’s
all you need.” _

The Bears might be especially interested.
It wasn’t too long ago they selected wide

receiver Bernard Berrian out of Fresno State ,

in the third round of the 2004 NFL Draft.
Berrian was projected to be a ﬁrst—round pick
prior —to his junior season in 2002 when he
blew out his knee. The injury,,coup‘led with
the departure of quarterback David Carr,
led to his stumble on most teams’ Draft
boards. . ‘

' But not the Bears, who grabbed a fully-

. recovered Berrian, and thought they_ found

a productive player much to some other
teams’ doubts. . A

They were right, as Berrian immediately
stepped into a starting role and has grabbed

more than 50 passes in each of his three .

seasons in the league.
Kinder may be their chance to strike
gold again with a late—round wide receiver

pick. But Kinder, much like many potential .

draftees, doesn’t really have a clue where he’s
going to end up.

“-I feel like it’s_ really up in the air, and I
could goianywhere on the second day,” said
Kinder. “I’ve heard as highuas four and as
low as seven. I feel like it’s all a crap-shoot

It’s disheartening, especially for Kinder,

who just recently returned home from San
Diego, Calif., after training since the end of
Pitt football’s season in December.

Callahan and theirest of Repl Sports put
Kinder, who has already graduated from
Pitt, on a diet and put him through drills
every day.

“Derek’s been out [in San Diego] working A

with a personal strength coach, a speed coach

.and a nutritionist,” said Callahan. “He was

with about eight other guys out here training
for the pro day or the combine.” ‘

Those other guys include running back
Javon Ringer from Michigan State, quarter-
back Hunter Cantwell from Louisville and
quarterback Chase Clement from Rice.

Now, Kinder is focused on lifting to main-
tainhis ‘weight, running routes and ﬁghting
off the pre—Draft nerves.

“I feel like the common fan doesn’t know
how much really goes into this,” said Kinder.
“There’s a lot of stress that goes into it- and

alot of mind games being played by teams. .

It’s fun at times, and I get anxiousat times. I
just want to know where I’m going to be at
and move on to my next goal in life, which
is playing in the NFL.” ‘ I

It’s something that ever since he was a

. child he’s dreamed of doing.Fittingly, Kinder

will sit through his ﬁnal moments of. angst
with his family back in his home in upstate
New York. I ' .

“It will be a real memorable moment,”
' said Kinder, “To have the opportunity to get

in the NFL is really an honor.”

through any long overtimes and crease rnelees.
Playoff adrenaline has pulled players through
everything from concussions to_ broken legs.
If last year’s Cup-run showed anything, Fleury
can handle a grueling playoff schedule.

SF: Fleury ranks eighth in the NHL in
games played by goaltenders. Also, of the
other ‘seven, he is the youngest. If you can’t
stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. \IX/ell,
Fleury sports an admirable tan and is starv-
ing. * ”

At this point, how far ‘do you think the
Penguins will goin the playoffs?

SF: With the way the Penguins have played
since replacing Therrien with Bylsma, it is not
outside the realm of plausibility for them to
win a best—of-seven series in just four games.
They’re almost that good. In fact, they can
even consider themselves the team to beat in
the Eastern Conference.

_ ’ There" is, however, a caveat —- every other /

Eastern Conference contender thinks the
same thing. If the Penguins realize the journey
to the ﬁnals is wide open‘ and simply rely on
the pieces they have, they should yet again
ﬁnd themselves  the ﬁnals. . 

GT: The Penguins: will not advance past
the second round. They do not have the
depth to compete with possible conference
semiﬁnal opponents Boston and Washington.
Both teams out—hiti and outscore Pittsburgh.
Boston allows the least goals against per game
in the NHL, while the punishing Capitals wear
opponents down —— the only regular less than
6 feet tall is goaltender Jose Theodore.
