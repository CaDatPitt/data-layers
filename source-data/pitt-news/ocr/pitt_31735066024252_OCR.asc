University

By C. M. WILTANGER

At the University of_Pittsburgh
Press, making books is serious busi-
ness Despite being an “overall
deﬁcit operation," Director Fred

"Hetzel‘s standards of quality are

high. The paneled walls surrounding
the receptionist are hung with
awards given by places that sound

unfamiliar to anyone who doesn't

knowi—-Printing lndusfries of
America, Chicago Book Awards,
The New York Printers Association,
and the American Institute of Gra-

‘ phic Arts, which Hetzel modestly

refers to as “a most prestigious

award.”
“For three years we were named

by the New York Times as one ofthe

*‘ most outstanding university presses

in the country,” Hetzel says.

Pretty good for an operation that
doesn't gross a profit. But making
money isn’t what the Press is for.

“We're here to publish those kinds

' of books that are economically not

feasible for a commercial publishing
house to do."

Publishing mainly in the areas of
humanities, social sciences, and

mental health, the Press prints those,
works of scholarly research which

traditionally would have no place on
the commercial market.
Occasionally, however, a few of
these books, such as Margery
Turner’s New Dance and Paul E.
Sigmund‘s The Overthrow of
Allende, develop what Hetzel refers
to as “a heavy classroom adoption."
Despite the success of such books,
the Press is, according to Fred Het-
zel, “a deﬁcit operation, just as any

' academic department is, and it’s

intended to be. But in order to keep
the deﬁcit within certain agreed
upon limits, we have to have books

that sell. And they’re generally the
regional books like Pickles and Pret-
zels, or The Shaping of the Point.”

The Press was founded in 1936 to
publish, in conjunction with the.
University and the Historical
Society of Western Pennsylvania, a
series of twelve regional works. Two
of those works, Pioneer Life In
Western Pennsylvania and With
Riﬂe and Plough, were chosen by
the American Institute of Graphic
Arts as among the best books of the
year. _ '
For the following twenty-five
years, regional histories were about
all the Press would publish. When
Fred Hetzeljoined the Press in I961,
the Press was just beginning to
broaden out into the humanities and
social science areas. Since then the
Press has achieved worldwide recog-
nition, and enjoys a considerable
reputation for publishing in the
humanities, social sciences and men-
tal health.

come back and reemphasized the
regional books, reprinting. older
ones and publishing new ones. I
think it’s a great vindication of our
regional books that so many are still
in print,” Hetzel says.

One of the most popular of the
regional books, Out of This Fur-
nace, by Thomas Bell, enjoys pheno-
menal popularity. In the four and a
half years since it was reprirzled by

~ the Press, Out Of This Furnace has ‘

sold over 25,000 copies.

‘with the University, only twenty to

The reason for all this is that

Not
  Quite.
Enough

The requirement making class attendance manda-
tory for first-year Pitt athletes and athletes with aca-
demic problems is like the law against underage

. drinking: it’s discriminatory, impractical, and assumes
the group being regulated is immature and
irresponsible.

This is not to say there haven't been problems mix-
ing academics and athletics at Pitt; Tony Dorsett’s
lack of a diploma is a less than shining example. But
the issue here is whether the requirement is the best
method to ensure athletes get an education.

Singling out athletes for mandatory class attend-
ance is a form of discrimination. Undoilbtedly there
are some engineers who don't attend class regularly.
Skipping classes is nothing to be defended;.it would be
nice, even ideal, if all students ‘showed up for their
classes. a

The problem with this regulation, not just for ath-
letes, but if it wereapplied to any student group, is that
it automatically assumes class attendance and
improved academics are closely correlated. The
assumption is that by. going to class regularly, a stu-
dent will get higher grades. Maybe. But why stop
there? If the senate council committee wants to actu-

_ ally aid student athletes in their studies, it might have '
recognized that its proposal is less than complete.

Things like building up athlete support services,
making additional tutoring available, and giving
coaches of the various teams more responsibility for
individual counseling, were not dealt with by the com-
mittee. Another factor the committee overlooked is ‘
the practicality of the requirement. Obviously, no sys-

' tem is foolproof. But that’s not an excuse to ignore the
obvious weaknesses of this one. Does the committee
expect a teacher with 500 students, 50 of whom may be
athletes, to stand after class and sign little cards? Do
they really think there isn’t an easy way around this?

i There are problems with students in other areas of
the university not attending class. lt’s unlikely a system
can be developed to monitor all of Pitt to make sure
students go to class. Nor should there be one. It's up to
the individual instructor—as it should be to the indi- .
vidual coach—to establish and regulate the attendance
and participation he or she deems necessary’. A leaky
university-wide system is incapable of doing this.

And ﬁnally, will this regulation apply to everyone‘?
A hypothetical situation: it's last year, the day before
the big Pitt-Penn State game. But Hugh Green hasn't .
gone to class for two weeks. Nowhonesjtly, will Hugh

be sitting on the sidelines drinking Co__ke‘or out tac- .

Brown Defends Kirkpatrick Consultation

Dear Editor:

I am writing to you because of a
front—page story, “Committee Not
Consulted on Kirkpatrick,” appear-
ing on May I3, 1981 in The Pitt-
News. The story reported on the last
Senate Council meeting, of May
llth, where Professor Pratt spoke
out as Chairman ofthe Educational
Policies Committee. His remarks

were in objection to my written .

statement, published in the Univer-
sity Times on April 23rd, that there
had been consultation concerning
the grant‘ of an honorary degree to
Ambassador Kirkpatrick. My
representations were both "honest
and accurate, notwithstanding The
Pitt News story to the contrary.

_ Dr. Edward Bozik, of the Chan-
cellor’s‘Ofﬁce, first spoke with me
on January 29th at 5:30 p.m. con-
cerning Ambassador Kirkpatrick as
a prospective commencement spea-
ker/honoree. He informed me that

Column  

there had been consultation with the
Political Science Department, but I
requested that there also be consul-
tation with the E.P.C. Committee
because of its long standing concern
about honorary degree grants.
Accordingly, on the next day, Fri-
day, January 30th, the Senate Office
spoke with Professor Pratt as your
Chairman, seeking to ascertain the
Committee’s attitude towards grant-
ing an honorary degree to the
“Ambassador. A notation of Profes-
sor Pratt’s response reads: “If the
Political Science Department thinks
it’s O.K. then E.P.C. has no objec-
tions." l subsequently spoke with
Professor Pratt in a follow-up call
during the first week of February, in
light of the February 3rd scheduled
meeting of the E.P.C. (The minutes
of that Committee meeting indicate
an announcement that the Ambas-
sador was tentatively under consid-
eration.) Dick Prattdid object to the
time span within which l had asked
for a reply concerning‘ the Commit-
tee’s reactions to the proposed hono-

4

rec, and he complained about the
administration’s failure to establish

a special screening committee per.

Council Resolution of April 14,
1980, but I heard no disapproval of
Ambassador Kirkpatrick. If there
was not approval by the Committee,
the first indication to me was at the
Council meeting on May llth.
The foregoing facts disclose howl
came to state. that there was consul-
tation and: approval—in a letter to

Professor John Beverly,- thereafter _

printed in the University Times. I
trust that The Pitt News story, which
was based on Professor Pratt’s
remarks at the last Senate Council
meeting, will be seen as incorrect. I
write this letter out of concern -for

the Senate; confidence in the Senate
is necessary in order for it to be
effective—-and to be so regarded——in
representing faculty and student
representatives‘ views when interact-
ing with administrators.

Sincerely,

William J. Brown

fetus would be “viable,” i.e., could
survive outside of the mother’s
womb; issuance of death certificates;
requirements that minors receive
parental permission before an abor-
tion; and finally, that the women
must be shown detailed color photo-
graphs of aborted fetuses.

The bill could also be termed
“Operation Guilt.”

2) The feature section of the Press
ran a story on several parents who
decided to allow their severely-
deformed newborns to die. Methods
of death included withholding
surgery, starvation, and reports of
lethal drug doses. Needless to say,
much of the article concerns the
heart-wrenching decisions that "par-
ents must make in these cases, and

‘the overwhelming guilt that follows. '

Dear Editor,

Unrelated to the high esteem with
which I regard my colleagues in the

protest your listing of Dr.‘ Roger
Ahlbrandt, who recently took leave
from the School of Social Work to

for Urban Affairs in the Department
of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment of the federal govenment, as
beinga professor of sociology. Dr.
Ahlbrandt is a professor in the

In both of these stories, the lead-
ing moral—and perhaps legal—.
question’ is ‘one of life. What
constitutes existence? What undefi-
nable quality demarcates life from
non-life? In some cases of children
born with spina bifida, the brain is
absent—a “normal life,” in any sense
of that phrase, is impossible. Like-
wise, unborn embryos at the
moment of conception are not sig-
nificantly different from any other
cell in the body, yet miraculously a
child is born nine months later. At
what point do we separate person-
hood from cell-hood—.or can we?

These are eternal questions, and
certainly above my capabilities. But.
who is capable? lt bothersme that
many parents are claiming that a
child_“belongs” to them'——that the

' question of life is subordinate to the

rights of the parents. This is a suffi-

‘ cient argument when, for example, a

pregnancy is life-th_reatening to the

mother—~but ~ to give over all

children to the complete authority of
the parents is to legalize-child abuse
and third-trimester abortions. Of
course there's a question of life here

the debate is over who is responsible

for that life, and ‘when. .

There's a reason why these issues
suddenly seem so important to me.

Four weeks ago I witnessed a mir-
acle.‘ . ’ _ I
My former employment, before
the unemployment line, was work-‘
ing as a/ blood collector at a local
hospital. One of my duties included

taking" samples from premature '

babies—no doubt the worst part of V

the job. But, to pardon the pun,
money is thicker than blood.

A month ago, on a weekend even-
ing shift, I arrived at the newborn
nursery in the middle of an arrest-
arrest of the cardiac type: ababy’s
heart had stopped. This wasn't the
strangest part, if you can believe
that: arrests are common in this par-
ticular ward. V

l was not, fortunately, required to

draw anything from this child. You .

see, the child was five months
premature.

Five months. Think of that.

To shorten this rather maiidlin
story, the baby died——thankfully, l
suppose, due to the strong" possibil-
ity of brain damage. As a footnote, I

quit m_yjob-after four years ofwork.‘

Sometimes, money becomes expen-
dable in the face of human intangi-
bles like guts: the guts to stick a
lancet into the foot of a dying,pre-
mature infant.

_ The seemingly circular arguments
presented here are not to confuse the
issue, but ‘to’ sound] some warning
bells: the easiest method of dealing
with abortions and natal euthanasia

A is to do what 1 did‘ with my job—.—

walk away. This is probably, the
most popular option in dealing with

‘ most ethical problems. Yet this path .

will not lead to a solution; the ques-

tions will-not simply vanish. Admit- - ‘
_ tedly, perhaps the answers do not

exist, but to forfeitthe possibility of
enlightenment ‘is to insure eternal
darkness. ‘-

signed a hiring agreement and pub-
licized it in l972, whites retaliated
with their own boycott.

“After we signed the agreement,
an organization sprang up called the
National Association of White Peo-
ple; Some redneck 'in the McKees
Rocks area got behind it and every-
body fell in line behind it." Smith
said. “This was all going on in the
market place, and we, consequently,
had some severe problems."

Smith says that the company did a
number of things to work the prob-
lem out, like developing an open
door policy to the press and public.

“We try to be open about.our
situation here,” Smith said. “lfwe’ve

got good news to report, we report
it, and if we have bad news, we
0 report that too.”

In addition to the boycott, there
was the image of the beer drinker
himself. For a long time they were
considered to be pot-bellied steel
worker types who wanted to guzzle
all the gusto they could get. lron
City ﬁt nicely into that stereotype,
with its reputation as a staple of the
corner tavern shot and a beer crowd.

Trends in the 70’s towards lighter
drinks such as white wine and min-
eral water, along with a’ mania for
weight loss altered those traditional
demographics. According to Smith,
the traditional lron City consti-
tuency will always be there, but a
new generation of beer drinkers
wanted something‘ different, some-
thing ﬂashy and up-scale. something
light.

Enter lron City Light.

Iron City Light Beer more than
anything else, is responsible for the
successes of Pittsburgh Brewing.

Since the new brand entered the

market-in I978, it has become the
backbone of the brewerv. The key to
Light’s success lies in its image.
According to Smith, light beers
have been around since the sixties,
but it wasn’t until Phillip Morris
bought Miller Brewing Co. in Mil-
waukee, and “began pushing light
beer like it pushed cigarettes,” that
the product began to sell. Accepta-
bility is the essential ingredient.
Smith targeted his Light beer to
the new generation of beer drinkers,
an “up-scale” audience that goes out

to “night spots” rather than the’

corner bar; men and women with a
larger amount of money to spend on
en'tertainme_nt.i ‘

“More women are drinking beer
today.” Smith said. “Ten years ago,

girls were afraid to order a beer in a

bar. They would order something
fancy like a Brandy Alexander or a
Grasshopper. Now, with the lights it
has become acceptable for a girl to
order a beer.” ~ ‘

Smith _says that l C Light was a
success because it hit the shelves on
the crest of a light beer wave.

“We attached oursghtessomewhat

- to it,”Smith‘said‘.‘g

That does not totally explain the

incredible hold that Light has man-
aged to gain over Pittsburgh beer

= drinkers. By I980, Iron City Light

ac’counted for 70 percent of all light ‘
beer sales in the Pittsburgh area.
That is where advertising and the

  
  
  

r .

personal charms of Smith himself
come in.

Smith‘s T.V. ads, showing young
people in posh watering holes like
the Grand Concourse, and the
Library Disco asking for l C Light at
every turn, were an immediate suc-
cess. The combination of up—beat
imagery and local pride worked to
make the beer a best seller.

Smith began by making the sales
pitch himself, and later, when actors
were used for the main portion ofthe
ad, Smith could be seen in back-
ground, a-la Hitchcock, calling to a
bartender or walking across the

 
 

stage set. _

“I did two commercials, and then"
I started doing cameo commercials,"
Smith said. “It says that the presi-
dent is involved, and it’s gotten to be
a lot of fun.”

lron City made strong gains‘-at
this time too, but it was not simply
riding on If C Light's coatitails.
Smith applied ma'ny'of the same‘
marketing techn‘iques'to Iron City
that "he did with I C Light and, in
addition, he’started a series of com-

Smith considers the commorative

Pittsburgh for its acceptance of his’
product. ' _ . T ,_
There was a change behind the

T label as well. One ofthe reasons lron

City had .been considered a blue

high level of hops make the .brew
seem bitter. . S’ - .
,When he became president, one of-
the first- things Smith did was to_

cent. Even_ at this lower level, Iron

from a low of I9 percent just two
years before.

The popularity and success of
lron City and Pittsburgh Brewing
Co. seemed never ending. Smith was
a celebrity, and the beer was an insti-
tution. Suddenly, with the walkout
of 400 union plant workers, the bot-
tom seemed to fall out.

When strikers demanded a share
in brewery profits, over and above

an agreed-upon wage settlement, the

company’s board of directors voted
to dissolve the l20 year-old
operation.

Smith contends, that the union

leadership failed to inform the rank
and file ofa settlement‘ offer made by
the company prior to its profit shar-
ing demand.
_ “We made an equitable offer,”
Smith said, “and then somebody
came up withthis goofy idea to share
the profits.”

Smith says that the $1.3 million
proﬁt in 1980 was made up, in half,
by tax carrybacks. Taxes that Pitts-
burgh Brewing Co. did not haveto
pay becauseof their past losses.-

“So, ineffect, we only made about i
$600,000,” Smith said. “The con-''

tract that .we were perfectly. satisfied

' with was going to cost us $750,000, 5

so we were starting off in the--hole.”
i But the questions, and any cause
for concern do not stem directly
from the strike. Thelwalkout marks
a point at which the company's
enthusiasm was tempered by a new
reality. There are other factors that
will soonhave to be faced if Pitts-
burgh Brewing is to _stay on top of
the game. i S
According to Smith, the company
has come near the limit as far as sales
are concerned.in certainareas. To
expand will take additional capital
and intensive and farther reaching
advertising. The dilemmatis in the
formgof a paradox: the case of the
too-successful regional brewery.

‘to maintain its position, the com-
pany has to expand. Vln expanding,
the question is, how can it be done
without losing_ the “small brewery”

0 character that has made the beer so

popular.

Smith,‘ while concerned“, about _

these new situations,. is generally

optimistic. He,has'already cut back '

distribution from 25 states to I4.
The logic here is thatit will be more‘
efficient to put advertising money

‘There is also the possibility of

something called “high gravity .

Athletes, Coaches React (To Attendance Rule

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

Reactions among Pitt coaches
and athletes vary concerning a
recent Pitt Senate Council ruling
that placed monitoring restrictions
on some athletes’ class attendance
and performance.

The ruling, approved by the
Council June 8, requires all incom-
ing freshman and transfer athletes,
as well’ as those sporting a sub-2.0
"Quality Point Average and those
athletes who received an ‘F’ grade
the preceding term, to have attend-
ance cards signed by their instruc-
tors each week.

The cards are designed to show an
athlete's week-to-week attendance
and progress in each class, and will
be turned in to the Pitt Athletic
Director's Office each week. Ath-
letes failing to meet the Senate's
standards of “regular attendance at
classes" can be declared ineligible
for the following week of competi-

tion in his sport, until he or she has g

resumed “satisfactory" perfor-
mance. The Senate reserved the
right to grant an athlete leniency
under some conditions. .

an English Writing major, called the

Thompson added that with moni-
.toring over 200 students who are
taking four or more classes per term,
there is a possibility some difficulties

may occur. . .

Besides Abraham's vote, there
was little student input into the

_ decision. -

Abraham said there are two stu-
dent government appointees on the
senate athletic committee. One stu-
dent graduated in April, however,
and the other returned home. Abra-

know how they're going to enforce
it. I think it’s good to monitor fresh-
men and transfers to get them
started on the right track. But l think
a lot-of athletes might raise a little
the NCAA, if that's
possible." '
Pidgeon added that he thinks
coaches have to take a little more
responsiblity for athletes keeping
their grades up, and noted the self-
monitoring program men's swiml

“There could have been a break-
down in communications, with our
representative,” Abraham said. He
explained that there are a large
number of student government
appointees on various university
committee. ‘ '

The athletic department is respon-
sible for monitoring the system and
dealing with any problems under the
proposal.

“Of course, no system is fool-
proof,” Pitt Athletic Director Cas
Myslinski said. “We're trying it out
now, to see where the bugs are.“

Eastern 8 Meets To Plan  Future

By JOHNETTE HOWARD T i

Pitt News Sports Editor

Officials from the Eastern basket-

converge on Pittsburgh this Tuesday
for‘ the conference's summer meet-
ings, all hoping for some long, loud
and strong encouraging remarks to
ebb growing fears about the future
of the outfit. _ i

What they'll likely hear from
Commissioner- Leland‘ Byrd and his
cronies is a whimper.

A television package, future mem-
bership committments and possible
expansion are the major items on the

agenda andthe schools are looking .

to Byrd to show evidence that his
leadership ability goes beyond
inhabiting his office daily. And even
that may change. V‘

Byrd was given a directive last
year by the Eastern 8's athletic direc-

represent Pitt and the East at the
Festival, a quadrangular meet
against three other nations, July 24-

Carter were both thefastest qualiﬁ-
ers in the |00- ‘and 50-freestyle

Pidgeon, who recently took third .

in the 200-meter event in the Seven-

Bemis Lures 28 Soccer Recruits——And Counting

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pin News Sports Writer

“Finishing the attack" will be the first thing on the Panther.

booters‘ minds when the I981-82 season opens up this Sep-
tember. And, with the largest group of recruits in recent
years joining the collegiate soccer program at Pitt, head
coach Leo Bemis is looking for contributions that will make
a successful I982 season. The Panthers will have 28 new-
comers along with 22 returning players, and one junior
college transfer.

Bemis has been scanning the area for goal scorers in hopes
of finding someone who will add to the offensive attack of

the Panthers, who finished 7-8 last year.

“I've tried to stress goal scoring and finishing the attack
when this recruiting year came around," ‘said Bemis. “We
need the people who are going to score against tough teams
all season long. That‘s why I’ve been encouragingthose with
good scoring backgrounds."

Bemis found two players with a history of scoring at
Trinity High School in Washington, Pa. Trinity, which has a
solid background of winning soccer under coach Art
Richardson, sent two recruits to the Pitt soccer team: Gary
Gaido and Jim Steele.

Gaido is an All-WPIAL midfielder who is presently play-
ing senior ball with an area Keystone League team. Gaido‘s

ments down pat.

. Gaul, a junior setter, and
Kukalis, an outside hitter, are
both veterans of the U.S. '
Mideast Training team and
members of the Three Rivers
Volleyball Club that competed at
the Junior Olympics Tourna-
ment at Lisle, Illinois earlier this
week. The two Pantherettes will
join the U.S. East team in com-
petition against three other
regional teams staffed by many
of the top women volleyball
players in the country. The Festi-
val runs July 26-29 in Syracuse,
N.Y. Gaul, a two-year letter-
winner at Pitt, is considered one
of the East's best collegiate set-
ters. Since coming to Pitt, Gaul
has mastered the setting job
quickly, after starting out as an
outside hitter. No small feat,
considering setter is perhaps the
most difficult postion to play in
volleyball, comparable to the
quarterback spot in football.

“Julie is making marked deve-~
lopments in learning strategy tac-

leadership,” Collier said. “She is
one of the hardest working play-
ers I have ever coached.”

Collier also has high regards
for Kukalis, not only as an out-
side hitter but as a server and
defensive player as well.

“Robin makes defensive plays
no one else on our team is capa-
ble of making. She has natural
athletic abilities of strength and
quickness combined with the
desire not to let any ball hit the
ﬂoor,” Collier said. “If Pitt -had
six servers like Robin, we would
never lose a match-to any team."

Kukalis wouldn’t want to play
the game any other way.

“I like playing defense. I go
out on the court to play well, and
to win," she explained.

versatility allows him to play both the wing and midfield
positions. He could contribute a great deal to either areas for
the Panthers.

Steele booted his way into second place on Trinity‘s career
list of scorers behind all-time leader Matt Engle. Engle has
recently transferred to Pitt but will have to sit out a year
under NCAA rules to become eligible for the Panther squad.

“Steele is a good, hard-nosed player who is steady and
knows how to shoot," said Bemis. “Both he and Gaido have

‘experience playing with and against older competition

which we hope will add to their game ability."

Bemis also feels highly about Chris Blatz, who will be
making his way to Pitt after a one-year layoff. While in high
school in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Blatz took all-state
honors and was his school and leagues Most Valuable
Player. Blatz, who has spent the year playing senior league
ball, will be looking to earn a place on the front line.

Coming from Centerville, Ohio is Jeff Dunn, a sweeper-
back who chould add to the Pantherdefense. Other local
players include Eric Hohman, an All-WPIAL player from
Mt. Lebanon, and Dan Zemanski, an All-WPIAL mid-
fielder from WPIAL champion Upper St. Clair. The U.S.C.
team ﬁnished third in the state last fall. And, bringing in
some international flavor to the Panthers will be Carlos
Quinoes, a national youth player from Puerto Rico.

team

The Panthers are coming offa disheartening experience in
the fall of I980. By the first week in October. Pitt was
sporting a 7-2 record and looking ahead to post-season
playoff competition. but aftera nine-day layoffthe Panthers
returned to play a very conditioned. winning Bethany team
and were defeated by a 3-I score.

Beginning in mid-October with the Bethany loss. the
Panthers went on to lose the final six games of the season,
withtheir overall record dropping from a respectable 7-2 to a
mind-boggling 7-8.

“We had an extremely tough schedule in that last half of
theseason,” said winger Eric Tiedtke, “plus our scoring was
not distributed all over the field like it should have been. We
had a one—phased strategy. We attacked from the right side
alI°the time and that is where most of our goals and assists
came from. Itgot to a point that ifour right side was shut off
we didn’t have enough depth for the other side to compen-
sate. Consequently most of the other goals that were scored
came from penalty kick situations.”

“We need to equalize the scoring all over the field," said
Tiedtke. And this season’s schedule is more evened out with
the tougher competition not in just one time period. If we
can get the freshmen coming to help with the attack, it will
certainly help. Our season may rely on them filling in at key
positions and making immediate contributions.”

Pitt Pantherettes Julie Gaul (above) and teammate Robin, Kuk-alis will join eight ‘more of the
East’s elite volleyball players at the National Spo_rts"Fe"stival later this month in Syracuse, N.Y.

The East will compete against three other regional teams from across America.

Eastern 8 Plans Ahead

continuedfrom page nine
backed out of the deal at the last
minute before the season began,
leaving the Eastern 8 with no tele-
vised games at all that year.

So why is TCS involved again‘?
And why are there two or three com-
panies trying to drum up advertising
sponsors instead of awarding the
contract to just one company?

“That seems to indicate that
they're (the league office) grasping,”
Chipman said. “It seems like they
haven’t got anything else.” '

It also seems likely that regular
season Eastern 8 games won’t hit the
TV screen again this year. The
league hasn’t yet named a company
to handle the coverage, and the sea-
son begins in early December. In
I980, Mizlou had the rights an entire
year to lineup advertisers and pro-
duce the package, and they couldn’t
pull it off.

Expansion ofthe Eastern 8 to nine
teams in the near future seems to
occupy the back burner now that
Old Dominion, the basketball
school without a conference, has
made a $10,000 committment to
help form an athletic conference
consisting of colleges in Virginia,
Washington and North Carolina.

The other name that’s been tossed
around is Penn State, an original
member that went out of the league
in 1979 strutting arm-in-arm with
coach-messiah Dick Harter, and
drunk with visions of producing an
independent basketball power.

Penn State is now one of the
major movers to build the proposed
all-sports Eastern League, and Penn
State Athletic Director Joe Paterno
is one of its strongest supporters.
But he admits that if the league
doesn't materialize, Penn.State may
be loo'king for a basketball confer-
ence. And Eastern 8 has openly
expressed interest in letting Penn
State back in the fold;

“Nothing has changed,” Byrd
said, regarding expansion. “We

want to see where everyone stands.”
That translates to the future mem-
bership committments Byrds says he
will ask for at Tuesday's meetings.
But, they may be slow coming. Its
very likely at least half ofthe Eastern
8 members may hold out until the
November deadline_to notify the
Eastern 8 they’ll be back for the
I982-83 season. That definitely
includes Pitt, and probably Rutgers,
West Virginia and Duquesne.

All eight schools are committed
for this season, but several, includ-
ing West Virginia and Rutgers, are
eyeing Paterno’s Eastern League.

Rutgers and West Virginia are
interested in Paterno’s idea and, if
they should pull out, there’s no
doubt Pitt will be looking beyond
the Eastern 8 as well.

Pitt has talked very briefly about
joining the Big East League, com-
prised mainly of East Coast basket-
ball schools like Providence, Boston
College and Syracuse, which
recently obtained a $2 million net-
work contract. Although Myslinski
discounted the chances of Pittjoi_n-
ing the Big East because of the rela-
tively long distance and thus
expense travel involved to get to the
coast, Chipman isn’t adverse to the
idea.

“They just got a $2 million con-
tract and they’re way ahead of us
(the Eastern 8),” Chipman said.
“They’re making money in their
situation and we’re being assessed
money for'our membership in the
Eastern‘8.” ~

“We're committed to stay in the
Eastern 8 next season, but if it
doesn't look well, we're going to
have to make a decision,” Chipman
added. “We're not going to sit
‘around and let it collapse around

With Rutgers, West Virginia and

‘Pitt getting edgy, those rumblings

you hear could be Eastern 8’s
foundation.

Penn State football Coach and Athletic Director Joe Paterno
has been extolling the virtues of the Eastern League he’s trying

to help organize.‘

Pitt Says No,Joe

Penn State, Temple, Boston Col-
lege, West Virginia,iand Rutgers,
along with several other Eastern
schools, are meeting in Philadelphia
today to ‘discuss the_ prospect of
forming an all-sports league.

Pitt, very successful as an inde-
pendent, remains ' uninterested in
Penn State Athletic Director Joe
Paterno’s latest passion, .mainly

because -the benefits Paterno has

been spouting off are sweet could-
bes instead of solid guarantees.

tion of specific formats or guidelines
