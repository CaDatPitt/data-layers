One of America ’s greatest student newspapers -- since 1906

A VOLUME XCVIH, NEMBER 79

JONATHAN CHECK
Senior Staff Writer

Trrnothy James is used to yielding to students while dri-
ving through Oakland.

But James, a software engineer and graduate student,
gave the right—of-way to a peculiar breed of pedestrians one
October aftemoonz three wild turkeys, ﬂapping around at the
comer of South Bouquet and Dawson streets. '

“It was a very odd scene to see in the middle of
Pittsburgh,” said James, who quickly snapped pictures of the
mysterious birds. ‘

He described the turkeys as “very ﬁiendly,” and was
able to get fairly close to them before one, presumably cam-
era-shy, ﬂew away. He’d never seen them in the neighbor-
hood, though he has heard of other sightings.

While James has no idea what the birds are doing in
Oakland, he has his suspicions. '

‘ ‘Trying to take over the world,” he said “Maybe escap-
ing Thanksgiving dinner.”

Speculations abound as to where they came horn and
what, exactly, they’re doing here. But pictures and eyewit-
ness accounts have conﬁrmed the unlikely: wild turkeys
have indeed made South Oakland their stomping ground.

Jim Dlmster, curator of birds at the National Aviary in

Local turkeys don’t rufﬂe man

Pittsburgh, said seeing turkeys in the street is not that unbe-
lievable, given Oakland’s proximity to Schenley Park
“If there’s wooded areas nearby, tlrere’ll probably be

p‘ turkeys around,” he said

Fred Butch, a parking attendant for Panther Hollow
Parking, conﬁrmed Dlmster’s assumption. He said he sees
the same three turkeys embarking on what appears to be a

regular route: awalk that begins with their emergence from ’

the woods behind his parking lot in the morning and ends
with their disappearance down Boundary Street in the
evening. O
15 “Sometimes, inthe evening,xthey’ll just march down the
booth. ’
Butchadded that one of ﬂre birds appeared to have “a
bum leg.” ' _ A
“I think it’s a mom, a. dad and a baby,” he speculated. ‘
Bob Scheible, a lifelong resident of South Oakland, has
been seeing the turkeys frequently since the summer, most
recently while walking his kids to school. Along with other
neighbors, he regards ﬂre turkeys’ routine appearances with
respect and wonderment. ' . ‘ . -
“Normally, you can’t get Within 50 feet of [wild
turkeys,]” he said, crumbling a loaf of Italian bread into a
wooded yard for the mysterious birds, who failed to show.

A road,” he said, indicating their direction from inside his small.

darts in front of traffic earlier this year.”

 turkeys, according to Scheible, have grown so
accustomed and desensitized to the neighborhood that they
will often get remarkably close to an outstretched handful of

Schoolhas no secrets, rep says

WHINSEC, page 1‘

According to the protesters, it: is a “noto-
rious” school with graduates who continue
to be implicated in human rights violations.’

When the group arrived, a long line of
protesters was twisted around sawhorse bar-
riers and yellow police tape, which led them
to an opening lined with police oﬁicers
obscuring the would-be protesters’ view of
the actual event

The oﬁicers, with metal detectors in
hand, swept each individual “to ensure civil-
ian safety.” .

Assistant Chief of Police for Columbus,
Ga, R.T. Boren said the police force was not
there to block the demonstrators’ First
Amendment rights, but that the police did
not want anyone with a “private agen ” to
create a hazard .

V Inside the police ‘boundaries, demon-
strators on stilts, in costumes and under signs
chanted a protest mantra “The people unit-
ed will neverbe defeated,” the crowd said in
unison, immediately repeating it in Spanish.

Katie Emery, one of the nine Pitt stu-
dents attending ﬂie protest, said that the atti—.
tude was “lively and exciting.”

“It’s always energizing to see a huge
mound of people chanting,” she added. a

Civilian army employee of the WHIN-

SEC and retired Lt. Col. Lee Rials con- 2

ﬁrmed that counter-insurgency tactics are
taught to students. He said that such tactics
are a legitimate military subject

“There’s absolutely no truth, in my

' opinion, that our military, in any school, has
' ever taught torture —- the absolute crimes.”
Union leaders involved in SOA Watch .

joined the protest to stand against the
counter—insurgency tactics and ur1ion—bust-
ing practices they attributed to SQA/WHlN-
SEC graduates. ' —

Janice Boyer, representing Sisters of
Christian Charity in Chicago, said her reason
for attending Saturday’s rally had changed
since last year, when she attended to support
the closing of the SOA.

‘This’ year, I’m here to honor those vic-
tims,”’she said. “It’s a different motivation.”

Many groups with differing religious
aﬂiliations attended the protest in “solemn
remembrance” of six Jesuit priests, a worker ,

and a teenage girl killed in El Salvador.

Sunday’s solemn procession marched
down the open conidor lined with police
oﬂicers. Those in the front were draped in
black and painted white, holding eight card-
board coﬂins to represent the eight killed.

Protesters participating in the funeral
march also held white crosses listing the
names, genders and ages of the dead. ,

David Corcoran, a 69-year-old SOA’
Watch veteran, marched with a white mask

and black cofﬁn. Finding a break in the chain A

link fence separating the 10,0()0 or more pro-

testers from Fort Benning property, it
"Corcoran and 50 oﬂiersttrespassed onto the

Corcoran willingly participated in the
act of “nonviolent civil disobedience,”
despite ﬂie risk of six months in federal
prison and a $5,000 ﬁne.

“Our tax dollars have paid to kill [the

‘ victims],”said Corcoran. “That’s why I feel it

is  to remember those who are
voiceless, nameless.” ‘
This marked Corcoran’s second time

crossing “the arbitrary line.” He refused to

pay anything, which means he will spend six
months in prison and pay the maximum ﬁne.
The listing of victims, beginning _ at

» 11:33 a.m., did not ﬁnish until approximate-

ly 4:15 pm.

‘°Ihere’s no question that there were lots
of crimes, terrible crimes, atrocious crimes
committed throughout [Latin America], and
some of the people who committed those
crimes did .take some course at
SOA/WI-IISC,” Rials said. ’

There were thousands of human rights
violators committing horriﬁc crimes, aside
from those associated with the SOA, accord-
ing to Rials. '

When asked if "there was any connec-
tion between ﬂie school and acts of terrorism
committed by its graduates, he responded,
“absolutely not.” » .

' Rials pointed out that there is, “nothing

' secret, classiﬁed, or otherwise hidden here.”

EDITORIAL

Get a load of-this bunch of turkeys

As has been a tradition since the
days of President Harry Truman,
President George W. Bush pardoned a
Thanksgiving turkey Monday. This
year’s beneficiary, Katie, will_ live
out the rest of her days protected at
Frying Pan Park’s Kidwell Farm in
Herndon, Va.

Setting aside the hypocrisy of
pardoning one turkey and then gob-
bling up another, the editorial board
at The Pitt News has decided, in the

spirit of the season, to issue a few,

Thanksgiving pardons ‘of our own.
To begin, We’d like to pardon
Michael Jackson. Regardless of what
he did or ‘didn’t do to any as-yet
unnamed young boys, he’s transcend-
ed the_ boundaries of normalcy so
much that it would probably be better

. for everyone if he spent the rest of his

natural lifespan pecking at grain in an
enclosed pasture. -

Next, we offer a tremendous par-
don to Pitt football head coach. Walt
Harris. He’s done a tremendous job

"taking a team from disarray to

respectability, and. we-hope he does-
n’t accept any other tremendous job
offers. ‘ I

We offer a pardon to Pittsburgh’s
recent weather. Clearly it’s suffering
badly from schizophrenia. Plus, if we
pardon it, maybe it will go away.

The onion family has been suffer-

ing greatly in light of the recent

hepatitis outbreak. We offer a pardon
to Vidalia, white, yellow and every
other non-green onion. We still love
you. ’

Darby Conley, creator of the
comic strip‘ “Get Fuzzy,” and origina-
tor of Pittsburgh’s smell-related
uproar,‘ earns a pardon. Having
recently set foot in South Oakland,

we are forced to concur about the‘

smell.

.We’d like to offer Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg a pardon for, well,
everything. There’s no way one man
could have caused everything he gets
blamed for. q

Not to shock anyone, but journal-
ists have been known to occasionally
knock back a beverage or two after a
hard day’s work. To that end,_we’d
like to offer a pardon to the fine
Banker’s Club line of bottom-shelf
liquor. It’s fair to say that all of us
have, at some dawn or another,
cursed the existence of the Banker.
We take it all back, and we’ll see you
soon. ‘

We offer a pardon to the Steelers.
Aftersuch a long and glorious tradi-
tion of‘ excellence, we guess it"s‘okay
for them to blow. ,

We’d like to explicitly not pardon
Penn State. We find them guilty,
beyond a shadow of a doubt, of suck-
ing. Sentencing will be carried out
Dec. 6 at the Pete. 7

Finals time may as well be naked time

Anyone who hasn’t spent the past
year on the moon has seen the movie
“Old School” multiple times. This cine-
matic addiction has inspired and captured
the minds of college students all over like
no other ﬁlm since the days of “Animal
House.” Two of my friends recently fell
victim to antics inspired by none other
than W111 Ferrell and his now-
legendary “We’re going
streaking!” battle cry.

. I received a phone call
late Friday night from my two
compadres —— who were
beyond ecstatic at the fact that
they had just torn down
Oakland Avenue sporting
nothing more than their birth-
day suits. The next day, I
received another phone call,
this time, the tone far less
than elated. Streaker No. l
was calling to report that he
was hungry and wanted breakfast.

 enough; go eat.” I replied to
my pal, knowing very well there had to
be some catch coming in the near future.

“We have to get breakfast, and you
have to pay for me. I lost my wallet
streaking last night,” he said. This would
be the aforementioned catch.

The result of this conversation was a
brunch at Panera Bread, that left a $13
dent in my less—than—a1nple checking
account. I’m_ not bitter about the whole
money deal with my friend. I know —
scratch that — I’m absolutely sure that
we’ll even out all the loans I’ll give him
until he gets his credit and bank cards
back. However, it made me question why
these events even transpired in the first
place.

Almost every school has some tradi-
tion that involves streaking, or some
form of nakedness, that every young
scholar completes before doomsday -
also known as graduation. Let’s face it;

':‘v.:-.;:.*.--.'-in

you can’t exactly get away with such
indecent exposure without a big, fat cita-
tion accompanying it after your college
years have vanished.

A streaking tradition is the perfect
excuse to get even the most timid stu-
dents to "chuck inhibitions to the wind
and bare it all in the name of Pitt pride.
Even Penn State, the school
whose very name spurs the
attachment “sucks,” has a
streaking tradition. We can’t
be shown up by the Mifﬂin
streak, where students strip
down, cover their heads
with bags, and take a lap
during the height of ﬁnals
week. If nothing else, it has
to contain some academic
value simply as a means of
stress relief.

At the University of
Virginia, students make a
point of running bare—assed through carn-
pus to touch the statue of Thomas
Jefferson. Surely, that founding father is
looking down with nothing but gratiﬁca-
tion at the legacy his institution of higher
learning has established.

Even Lafayette College, sitting up on
a hill in Easton, Pa., is home to a pre-
graduation streak, “Farinon to Skillman,”
where everyone watches as the soon—to—
be graduates take one last stroll in the
quad, sans any garments.

Every year, typically around
Homecoming, I hear people rant and rave
that Pitt lacks tradition and blah blah
blah. Here is the opportunity to turn it all
around. I think the “Cathedral Streak”
has a nice ring to it. Or maybe, “Bare it
up to Benedum.” Who knows? My allit-

eration skills are lacking, but I’m sure V

someone could come up with something
clever and witty for our student body to

Squabbling in Prague and finding out what friendship means

We arrived in Prague late, without a
map- or a place to stay. The exchange
counter was closed so we couldn’t get
Czech money, and when we stepped out
of the train station, we saw that the
streets were deserted except for a guard
doing his patrols with a machine gun.

Tension had been growing between
Adam and me in the recent days. Still
only three weeks into our trip, we were
beginning to realize that traveling
together could take its toll on a friend-
ship. ,

We secured a map from a group of
Canadians who we passed on their way
into the station to get a night train out
of the city. It had a few hostels marked
on it, so, practically alone, with little
sleep and our packs heavy on our
backs, we began to trek toward the
nearest one.

Adam will still probably say that I
was the one who got us lost. I’m pretty
sure he had the map upside down. But
regardless, we found ourselves back at
the train station before we reached the
hostel. I was hungry. We began to bick-
er.

When we eventually did see the
hostel sign peek out from around the
corner, we shouted for joy. We waltzed
in and were still smiling at overcoming
our trial when the desk attendant

Dear Editor,

It is unfortunate that Mr.
Ciampaglia chose to title his review of
the Machu Picchu show at Carnegie
Museum of Natural History, “Carnegie
Exhibit is Underwhelming,” for much
of his review is quite positive. I wish to
provide an explanation as to why the
largest area of the exhibit, which he did
not ﬁnd appealing, is presented in this
manner. The exhibit is based upon
Hiram Bingharn’s 1912 excavations at
Machu Picchu. The artifacts that he
recovered all reﬂect the daily life of the
servant class supporting Emperor
Pachucuti, who built his royal estate at
this spectacular location. No artifacts
were found that can be associated with
Inca nobility, for these elite items of
gold and silver would have returned
with the Inca ruler to his imperial capi-
tal in Cuzco. No royal burials have ever
been found at Machu Picchu, for their
tombs were also in Cuzco. .

Except for a few gold and silver
earrings and necklaces from the burials
excavated by Bingham, almost no pre-

A cious metals have ever been found at the
site. It would be difﬁcult to mount a
major Inca show with quantities of large

there was no room for us
here. The only other hostel
that would probably have
room was on the opposite
side of Prague. The atten-
dant circled the place on our
map but suggested we not
walk all that way. We slung
our packs over our shoul-
ders and trudged back into
the night.

As we passed the train

us in circles twice already. I
grabbed for the map. He
held on. It ripped in two
straight down the middle,
and we stood there staring
at each other in the rain,
each with half of a ;nap
hanging from our hands,
ﬂapping in the wind.
That’s the closest we
ever came to killing each
other. We did ﬁnd the hos-

station for the third time,
we thought about a hotel.
They were all outlandishly expensive.
Little things — like who was right, and
when, that had been building up during
the past few weeks started to arise, and

we began to snap at each other. Soon,

we found ourselves lost again. The map
only showed the major streets. _
With this long overdue realization,
I declared that I was giving up. I would
sleep on the lawn in front of a nearby
church and ﬁnd my way in the mom-
ing. Adam reluctantly followed.

Without talking, we assembled little
beds with our clothes and lay down. It
began to rain.

It all seemed so wrong. Back on
our search, Adam insisted that he knew
where we were going. I wanted to look

gold and silver artifacts, since most
were melted down by. the Spanish
invaders. The everyday artifacts from
the site may appear to be “underwhelm-
ing,” since the artifacts appear _“drab”
when compared to the gold and silver
loan pieces, but these artifacts are used
to portray everyday life at this Inca royal
estate, the main focus of this exhibit.
The reviewer indicates that many of
artifacts from Machu Picchu are still in
storage at the Yale Peabody‘ Museum
“... waiting to be rediscovered.” The
‘entire collection of artifacts, faunal and
human remains was examined toideter-
mine what should be placed on exhibit.
The best objects from Machu Picchu are
on display. A reanalysis of the collec-
tion, as exhibited in the second to last
gallery, has led to new interpretations
about Inca daily life at this World
Heritage site. I again stress that the
exhibit focuses only upon Machu
Picchu and its discovery by Hiram
Bingham in 1911 and his 1912 excava-
tions. It does not attempt to be an all-
encompassing exhibit on the Inca
Empire and its culture. Thus there is no
need to “... spruce this collection up”
with objects from other museum collec-

tel and got a room. The bar

had just closed, but the bar-
tender told us that we looked horrible
and deserved some beer. I smoked my
ﬁrst cigarette in six months, and things
became all right. _

We had our ups and downs as the
trip went on, and when it came to an
end, we had a special bond. But that
was the summer after graduating high
school, and we were unclear as to how
good our friendship would remain.

I don’t see Adam too much any-
more, although I still refer to him as
one of my best friends. He goes to art

‘school in New York City; I’m here.
Last summer, he traveled around Japan;
I went to Jamaica through Arnizade.
Our paths rarely cross. But a couple of
weekends ago, I went to visit him.

 

tions, since this exhibit is strictly about
Machu Picchu and what the objects
from this site tell us about its residents.
The 50 or so loan objects and the recon— I
structed palace room are used to, give
the visitor a glimpse of what the royalty
at Machu Picchu may have used and
worn. These loan artifacts contrast dra-
matically with the artifacts of the 300 or
so servants that were resident at .
Pachucuti’s royal estate. ' _

I hope Pitt students, staff and facul-
ty will take the opportunity of visiting
the exhibit, for contrary to the review-
er’s comment, that “After all, how many
other Machu Picchu exhibits is this one
competing with that the’ public has I
heard of?” the answer is none! Machu
Picchu is  (museum admission and
the $2 surcharge) to all Pitt students
upon showing a Pitt ID card, and I urge
students to see the exhibit, for it is the
next best thing. to going to ‘Machu
Picchu. ’ '

We talked about a lot of stuff that
weekend. Mostly just catching up. We
touched on our ambitions and fears, art,
our parents, girls and the nature of our
friendship. We don’t have all that much
in common anymore, except a basic
drive to try to live as much as we can.
Our friendship’ moves on mostly
through a mutual feeling of being
happy for the other one. I don’t miss
hanging out with Adam for the stretch-
es of months I don’t see him. I’m glad
he’s not around. I know he’s out doing
all that he can to try to become all that

he’s always hoped he can be, and I feel

happy for him. -
Really, the only way friendships
can last is if you’re" able to feel happy
for the person after they’ve _gone.
That’s how I want most of my friend-
ships to be over the next few years.
People I’ve known and had fun with,
scattered to wherever they.have to be,
each trying his or her hardest to realize

' all that they want to be. I love to_ be able

to feel happy for people I know. And

it’s so sad when someone ﬂounders and f,

you can’t, no matter how hard you try. I
just hope that, as time goes by, I can
give others reason to be happy for me.

As for those who would never even ~

consider participating in such a revealing
and exposing venture, which is perfectly.
understandable, it’s bound to be a hell of
a show from an adrnirer’s ‘perspective.
No one can deny the rush brought on by
the steady support of a dedicated cheer-
ing section. Just like the basketball and
football teams, streakers need love, too.
Any way you look at it, there’s a place
for ‘everyone as far ‘as streaking is con-
cerned. " ’ ,

.Besides all the beneﬁts already
noted, if there is a time speciﬁcally for
the art of streaking, the odds of someone
running down Oakland "Avenue in dis-
clothed bliss and losing their wallet are
far less likely. If everyone has their own
wallets, then my and everyone else’s
checking. accounts will be in much better
shape. So really, one could say streaking
holds the key to ending post-college
debt. OK, not so much, but it could be a
lot of fun. ’ .

Spice Cafe, an atmospheric
global eatery on Atwood Street,
feels like a house divided — part
classic, collegiate bar, part sophisti-
cated urban bistro. Fortunately, it’s
an identity crisis that still benefits
the patron, serving up stylish fare
and fine drinks in a lush and invit-
ing environment. ,

underneath India Garden, will no
doubt lure the unadventurous barﬂy

lighting — soft, well-positioned

and corner lights lining the walls. A
variety of international masks and

But during a quiet afternoon-lunch,
they severely upset the vibe that the

empanadas, a Spanish pastry stuffed
with potatoes and .Chorizo sausage.

were delivered swiftly, accompanied
by a fresh garnish and a salsa dip-

— a nice touch. The pastries were
hot and crispy, and gave all indica-

was doubt in ourminds regarding _

the nationality of the sausage; it
tasted like fennel and was presum-
ably Italian, not Spanish.

vinaigrette dressing which, while
tasty, made the wrap soggy by the
meal’s end. The mango—g1azed
salmon was a healthy portion, too,
and the fish was done just right. The
glaze was delicious, as was its
strange and wonderful side dish,
Yucca mash (like mashed potatoes,
but denser).

In general, the food was hot,
fresh and good. But as I sat in the
ambient Spice Cafe", eating Yucca
mash, with rap music in the air and
basketball on the giant TV, I could-
n’t help but feel a little confused.

The restaurant seems to share

this sense of displacement. Spice
Cafe, ‘still in its infancy, feels
unsure of its fate. It is trying to be
two things at once: neighborhood
bar and an eclectic restaurant. Based
on its unique menu and stylish
atmosphere, we suggest, (and hope)
it concentrate on the latter. Beer and
wings are easy to find in Oakland. A
menu as creative and fun as Spice
Cafe’s is not.

City Theatre’s new cabaret—style
production, “Cafe Puttanesca,” is sure
to tickle your funny bone, and maybe
a few other body parts as well.

Set in Amsterdam a few years
after the end of World pWar II, the play

takes place in a small cafe called
“Cafe Rosa,” run by an American ex-
GI (Daniel Krell) and his Italian wife
(Stephanie Riso). The place is named
after the owner’s wife, but it has
earned the name “Cafe Puttanesca,”
because whores frequent it — much
to his spirited wife’s chagrin. The cafe
has three regulars who enjoy a good
joke or a mischievous song, and can
drink most men under the table. There

life is described as the story of
“Pygmalion” —— backwards; and,
finally, the German Baroness (Lenora
Nemetz), a dominatrix who is leaving
her profession to move to
Pennsylvania with a soldier who
promised to return after the war.

The Baroness’ departure is the
reason for the characters’ song—and—
dance performances; the audience
gets to be a part of the cabaret—style
show. With naughty limericks recited
at intervals, these three women of the
night delve into their past, present and
future through bawdy songs, provoca-
tive dances and amusing banter.

’ The show is just plainfun and
entertaining. The musical numbers
have quite an international scope,
with choruses ranging from French to
Russian. “My Mother’s Frying Pan”
is a delightful Irish melody about a
frying pan that gets passed down to
the married women from generation
to generation. Its sole purpose is to
crack their husband’s head with it
when he gets out of line. A

Playwrights Michael Ogborn and

Though we are only with these color-

Ogborn and Nolen have created char-

White’s finger h_a—s ealed

Tomorrow, The White Stripes will

‘play the A.J. Palumbo Center after

being rescheduled from an Aug. 1 can-
cellation, the result of when Jack White
broke his finger in an automobile acci-

dent. Tickets purchased for the August

show will be honored, and seats are
still available.

For fans of the band’s latest album,
Elephant, this should be a great show.
Jack White is a bona fide rock star now,
with magazine covers, a celebrity girl-
friend and an album containing actual
guitar solos — a big departure for him
—— to prove it.

His hand has been more successful
than he or anyone else would have

. thought possible, and he has every right

to indulge himself. The man who said
his little" two—piece could never play an
arena has done just that,_ as well as

’ playing large music festivals like

Coachella over the summer and the
Voodoo Music Festival in New Orleans
earlier this fall.

4 Although Rolling Stone may have
wet its pants (or its artiﬁcially dis-

tressed low—rider jeans) over Elephant,‘

for longtime fans, the urgency, rawness
and otherworldly innocence that made
the White Stripes so magical are gone.

Elephant is a good album, but
that’s all it is. There are some great
songs, like the cover of Burt

_ Bacharach?s “I Just Don’t Know What

To Do With Myself,” which has a
genius video of Kate Moss pole_danc-
ing to go with it. There are some terri-
ble songs, too, like “Black Math.”
Musically, it’s a direct rip off of an ear-
lier song, “Let’s Build a Home,” from
De Stijl, their second album. Lyrically,

it tries to recapture the childlike p1ay— .

fulness of their earlier ' work, but
instead comes off, like the album as a
whole, as dark, cynical and dishonest.
“Ball and Biscuit” is great live —
bluesy, swaggering and full of cheeky
sexualinnuendo, but the studio version
plods along and sags in the middle like
a fallen souffle.

The White Stripes’ first two albums
were. recorded «in their living room, and
perhaps in ‘an. effort to recreate the
same raw, lo-ﬁ sound, Elephant was
recorded at Toe-Rag Studios in
London, where all of the equipment

.dates back to the mid ‘60s or earlier.

Despite the’ Stripes’ efforts to keep
things simple, Elephant is their most
polished effort to date. In spite of the
fact that it’s a little too clean for my
taste, it does explain‘ why Jack White

ishies away from the blues-punk label,

and refers to the type of music they
make as 7‘Broadway Punk.” “There’s
No Home For You Here,” with its the-
atrical overdubbing, ﬁts that descrip-
tion perfectly. '

For fans of the Stripes earlier work,

tomorrow’s show will be bittersweet. .

But set lists from the dates they played
over the summer indicate that Jack and
Meg haven’t forgotten where they
came from, and are still throwing in a
few songs from their first two albums
to connect with the older fans in the
audience. Here’s hoping no one decides
to form a mosh pit, and that Jack sings
“Boll Weevil” as his last encore.

The White Stripes and VVhirlwind Heat
will play at the A. J. Palumbo Center,
Uptown, tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. Tickets

are _$30. For more information, call
(412) 323-1919.

Hoods National Tour showcases national and local acts

As the semester draws to a close,
concert promoters are looking to get the
best acts to Pittsburgh to ﬁnish out the
year. This Saturday, during Pitt’s
Thanksgiving break, the Hoods National
Tour, featuring the Hoods, Seventh Star,
Haste the Day, Lexus Jumps and Dead
Even will be a killer event for those in
town.

Hoods are a Victory Records band
known for their old—school hardcore
sound. It’s all about brutality and heavi-
ness, as these boys will rock you to

Russia and back with their trademark .

sound.
Seventh Star is another hardcore act,

 

on Facedown Records. Their sound is
very reminiscent of old—school hardcore
heroes Another eVictim, with a deep,
growly voice fronting the heavy guitars.
The breakdowns will have you moshing
with the best of them.

Haste the Day is a metalcore act
from Indianapolis. Upon first listen,
vocalist Jimmy Ryan could wow you
much like Dan Weyandt of Pittsburgh’s
own Zao. The music is fast, the vocals
are tenacious, and it’s all about the bru-
tality.

Lexus Jumps could go.down as one
of the most interesting bands on the
Pittsburgh scene. The band transcends

all genres and pulls out all the stops.
Whether it’s hardcore, emo, metalcore,
or even funk, Lexus Jumps touches it all.
Their songs vary from heavy numbers to
soulful breakdowns that you don’t see
coming. This is one act that no one in
Pittsburgh should ever miss, especially
considering they’re a local talent.

Dead Even is a mathy metalcore
band in the style of the Dillinger Escape
Plan and Meshuggah. The best part
about math-rock or —metal is that you
never know what is coming next. The
tempos and beats ‘are very stop-and—go;
one minute, you’re bobbing your head to
one rhythm, the next, it has already

¥.,»a:»:aav1r’v1a

changed time signatures. Confusing, yet

awesome. _ ' ’
This will be a fine show for anyone

around here for Thanksgiving break.

There’s nothing finer than sharing a .
turkey leg with your family, then‘drop- J

ping into the mosh pit for a night or two.
Be prepared 'for a brutal and amazing

show showcasing‘ some great new tal-

ents.

Hoods, Seventh Star; Haste the Day,
Lexus Jumps and Dead Even will playat
the Rex Theatre on the South Side on
Sat., Nov. 29 at 7 p.m. For more infor-

. mation, call (412) 381-6811. -.

Pittto battle Miami

for BigEast title

JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

This weekend’s matchup between
Pitt and Miami holds the Panthers’
Bowl Championship Series future in
the balance.

‘‘It doesn’t get any better than this,”
free safety Corey Humphries said,
when asked about Pitt’s season ﬁnale
against the Miami Hurricanes.

There’s no question that Saturday
night’s‘ sold out and nationally tele-
vised game at Heinz Field should be a
spectacle. Both teams are a win away
from claiming at least a share of the
Big East championship.

Humphries may have to rethink his

comment a couple of weeks from now,

V however, because if the Panthers (8-3,

5-1 Big East)‘ do beat the Hurricanes
(9-2, 5-1 Big East), a trip to Pasadena

for the Rose Bowl is not out of the
question. Not that going to the Fiesta-‘or
Orange’ Bowls would be a bad New
Year’s vacation either.

The winner of the Big East will get .

an automatic bid to one of those bowls,
assuming that the ‘champion won’t be
in position to play for the national title
in the Sugar Bowl. If Pitt and’West
Virginia University both win on
Saturday and share the championship,
Pitt would still be in good position to
play in the BCS, as long as it is more
than five _ spots ahead of the
Mountaineers in the BCS standings. As
of Monday; Pitts was ranked No. 25 in
the BCS, while West Virginia was not
ranked-

Of course, if Pitt fails to beat
Miami for the sixth consecutive year, it

Oct. 19, 1976: Third—string QB defeats Miami

Editor’s note: This is the 12th in a “Greatest Games”
series that will appear in The Pitt News the day
before each Pitt football game this year. Each part in
the series will detail Pitt’s greatest game against that

week’s opponent and will contain the original game

story as it appeared in The’ Pitt News. This story was
written by Steve Sybert on Oct. 18, 1976.

Though Pitt head coach Johnny Majors admits he

V is not a man of superlatives, he expressed many after

the Panthers’ 36-19 - victory over the Miami
Hurricanes at Pitt Stadium Saturday.

“Under the circumstances, I think this is the
finest hour for our coaching fstaffand the team that
we’ve had,” Majors said. “Certainly, we have an out-
standing team with everyone together and everybody
well, but under the circumstances, when our confi-
dence was being shaken, we did’ the things our team
and our staff knew they hadto do, and it worked out
as well as I could ever anticipate it or hope for.”

The “circumstances” of which Majors speaks,’ of
course, are the injuries to his top two quarterbacks,
Robert Haygood and Matt Cavanaugh, and having to
go with third-stringer, Tom Yewcic, whom he select-
ed just prior to game time, an untested and inexperi-
enced, though very capable, performer.

“Didn’t he do a nice job?” Majors asked
reporters after the win. “Handling that ball, handing
off —-— he didn’t make any mistakes. With a young
quarterback like Tom in there, I couldn’t have asked
for anything better.”

But it wasmostly a team effort,

Panthers by tackling Miami quarter-

again helped put more points on the '
board, when linebacker Arnie

Some random thoughts

   

From the depths of the madness 

°Way to go, Walt Harris, for finally
making a personnel change that
worked. =
Harris moved around some play-
ers on his defense, which is giving up

‘nearly 400 yards per game, and it

paid off against Temple. Harris
bumped J .J . Horne up to starting
weak-side linebacker, made Claude
Harriott and Azzie Beagnyam co-
starters at defensive end and named
Corey Humphries a co-starter ‘at free
safety with Tez Morris.

And it worked —— Harriott was a
disruptive force for the first time this
season, Horne came up with his first
career interception and Humphries

was second on the team with 11 tack-

les.

°How the hell can guys be co-
starters? They ‘can’t both start at the
same time, unless there’s some "new
football rule that allows this. If so,
then why did no one tell me?

Must be another one of Harris’
tremendous idiosyncrasies.

°Another move that Harris made was

to. demote Tim Murphy from co-I

starter — there’s that phrase again —
at running back and, give Jawan
Walker the job. A

Fortunately for Harris, Brandon
Miree made his return to the lineup
and resurrected a running game that

V was deader than Lazarus.

Another week with less than 50
yards rushing would have killed the

Panthers, especially since. the passing A

game stumbled for the first time this
season.‘ A

Miree’s return comes at the per-
fect time, with Miami coming to
town on Saturday. Hopefully, the
defense can hold up just enough to
give Pitt any chance at a win.

°How scary is a potential rotation of
Pedro Martinez, Derek Lowe, Tim
Wakefield and Curt Schilling?

‘Add that to the possibility that
Alex Rodriguez is interested in com-
ing to Boston and the Red Sox would
have their best shot ever at unseating
the Yankees on top of the'American

  for everyone to enjoy

League East. .

But the chances. that Rodriguez
will be in Boston next season are
nonexistent because the Red Sox
can’t afford the shortstop thanks to
outfielder Manny Ramirez’s enor-
mous contract. Fielding the two high-
est-paid position players in the game
is not a likely possibility for the Sox,
either.

°How bad must Kenyon Martin feel
for making fun of Alonzo Mourning’s
kidney aliment now that Mourning
has had to retire because of it?
Hopefully quite a bit.

°How bad vtiould the National
Football League feel if the officiating

blunder during Seattle’s loss to
the -
Seahawks a playoff spot? Probably» ’

Baltimore on Sunday cost
not at all. _ '

°I hate to say this, because it’s unfair
to Miree, but can you imagine how
good Pitt would have been if he ha
not been hurt? ‘

Sure, the defense is bad, but a
balanced offense would have made
up for that. It’s not a stretch to say
Pitt would have had more than a com-
bined 18 yards rushing against Notre
Dame and_West Virginia.

°Pitt fans will get/to see just what
kind of soldier tight end Kellen
Winslow Jr. is this week.

If he’s as good a trooper as he’

says, he should be able to stand the

likely frigid weather in Pittsburgh

\

this weekend. For some reason, “

something tells me that he won’t be
able to handle it, but that’s just a
hunch. I

°On Monday, Villanova lost to
Division II Chaminade in the Maui
Invitational, the Sliverswords’ first
win in the tournament they host since
1992.

How about that for Big East bas-

ketball?

I °Word out of Nebraska is that athlet-

ics director Steve Pederson is consid-
ering replacing head football coach

- Frank Solich.

..........-.......'-4.'-’.‘-‘.'J*J1n.I.l.a.lcIlJaIIIlalDnltcjlllclllulutllIIOIIIIVII‘!f‘V".'~1.“"2*."a‘ﬁ*t""1‘

Pederson already has his top
assistant from Pitt — Marc Boehm —
at Nebraska. Why not take his former
football coach, too? -.

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor
for The Pitt News and. knowing his
luck, will probably end up working
for a newspaper near Lincoln, Neb.,
covering Cornhusker football.

Harris knows the importance of
having every weapon at your disposal
against Miami’s defense. -Harris said
that Miami‘ is like a NFL defense
because of its speed.

_Senior Jonathan Vilma, who leads
the Hurricanes with 108 tackles, head-
lines a linebacking unit that also
includes fellow seniors D.J. Williams
and Darrell McClover. Free safety
Sean Taylor has intercepted 7 passes
this season and has also broken up 13.
others. ‘

‘ Miami’s defense, which leads the
Big East in five categories, has been
strong even‘ in two losses this season,
giving up only two offensive touch-
downs against Virginia Teach and one
against Tennessee.

Offensively, the Hurricanes ‘have
not been quite as dominant as they
have been in the past. Quarterback
Brock Berlin has struggled at times and
is sharing time with Derrick Crudup. 8

Running back Frank Gore, whom
Harris described as a high first-round
draft choice has been hurt most of the
season. Jarrett Payton, son of Hall of

Famer Walter Payton, has carried the ‘

load, running for 723 yards and 6
touchdowns. '

The game will be the ﬁnal home
game for Pitt’s seniors, including quar-
terback‘ Rod Rutherford, fullback
Lousaka Polite, comerback Shawntae
Spencer, and Miree. Game time is set
for 8 p.m. It will be televised on ABC.

Pitt defense dominates Hurricanes onthe way’ to national title

Greatest Games, page 14

lead, the Panther defense again went to
work as the third quarter began —

monster back Jeff Delaney grabbed an .

interception to thwart a Miami drive at

the Pitt three, defensive tackle Don

Parish sacked Baker to prevent a two-
point conversion after the Hurricanes’
first touchdown, and offensive tackle

George Messich recovered a fumbled ‘

punt to set up the Panthers’ third touch-
down. '

Capping a drive from the Miami
32, Dorsett took a handoff from
Yewcic, took several steps, to the left,
then handed the ball to Willie Taylor

on a reverse, -and the Panthers’ multi-
talented player ran it in for a score and
a 29-6 Pitt heading into the final peri-
od. .
Pitt’s only real defensive lapse of

the game occurred moments later,.

when a blitzing Panther failed to nail
quarterback Frank Glover, who capital-
ized on the error to connect on a 75-
yard TD pass to wingback Larry Cain.
The pass for two points failed.

But on the Panthers’ next drive,
Dorsett showed everyone, including
Cotton and Orange Bowl scouts, why
he is the leading candidate for the
Heisman Trophy, when he took a pitch
to the left from Yewcic, turned up the

middle, and split the Hurricane defense
like a bolt of lightning on his way to a
53-yard touchdown scamper.

“If there ever was a Heisman

Trophy winner — under the circum- ‘

stances, Tony Dorsett played better and
was more valuable even when we
needed him worse,” Majors said.
“When we had a third-team quarter-
back, he had his greatest day, under the
circumstances, and, I’d say, the great-
est day of any back that I’ve seen,
under the circumstances, period, pro or
college or high school.”

Majors is proud and very delighted
with the win, “under the circum-
stances,” of course.
