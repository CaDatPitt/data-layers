Pitt Supports Stevens Boycott -

By BETSY NORMAN
University support for the
nationwide boycott of’ the J. P.
Stevens company has been pledged
by the Chancellor’s office.

 The Southern-based corporation,
which is the second largest U.S.
textile manufacturer and one of the
“Fortune 500” largest industrial
corporations, has been found guilty

‘ of violating various labor laws,
including the National Labor
Relations Act, the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Act and the
Occupational Health and Safety
Act. Stevens was charged with
racial and sexual discrimination and
with violatin g federal regulations on
noise and dust levels. .

The nationwide boycott is an
attempt to exert pressure on the
company to improve working
conditions, increase salaries and
allow employe unionization.

Pitt Plans Handicapped Facilities;

Improvements, Call for

By PETE BUTCH and
M. PATRICK MONAI-IAN

A federal regulation calling for
insured’ rights for handicappedv
students across the country, soon to
be enacted, could mean an
additional expense ‘for the univer-

'sity in coming.years.

The regulation implements sec-
tion 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973 which prohibits discrimination
against handicapped or disabled
individuals in academic programs
or activities receiving ﬁnancial
federal assistance.

The ruling, which applies to Pitt '
as ea recipientiof federal assistance
from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, will

_ become law on June 1.

/

According to Vice Chancellor for ‘

Business and Finance Joseph
Dutton, Pitt’s Physical Plant
estimated three years ago that $2.3
million would be needed to make
the campus more accessible for
handicapped students.

Dutton approximated the extent
of renovation in recent years as
between $60,000 and $80,000. “Pitt
has frugally done the things that
will assist the most people,” he
said, “fully recognizing that there
will be inconveniences to some
handicapped persons.” " P ~ _

Future plans, according to

511+ AV[.

is coming!

a facilities.   ,

Dutton, call for spending $50,000 a
year on a continuing basis, “to
upgrade facilities for -the handi-
capped at places where it will be
cost-effective and beneﬁcial. ”
Work completed so far includes
curb cuts for wheelchairs, automat-
‘ic doors in the Student Union and
Cathedral» and special bathroom
facilities for men and women.
The rule does. not force Pitt into

. immediate reconstruction. It only

requires that programs be access-
ible, which means that when a
handicapped student registers for a
course it must be held in a building
the student can reach, Dutton said.

One situation cited by Dutton was
the second ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning. Elevators do not stop
there, shutting it off from students
with ambulatory handicaps. When
a ‘student with ,such a handicap
registers for a course scheduled for
that ﬂoor, the class is moved to an
accessible location.

According * to Thomas Galante,

.University advisor for disabled

students, passage of the _;egulations
was stalled for years because the
more than 36 million disabled
throughout the country were not
organized. He also said the lack of
political} clout under the Nixon
administration hindered develop-
ment. '

“Disabled people are ﬁnally

getting the rights we’ve been '

denied for years,” Galante said.

“We’re becoming better organized
and refuse to be pushed around
anymore.” ’ -

Now employers must make
reasonable accomodations to the
disabled, unless the changes would
cause the employer undue hard-
ship.

Federal recipients are also
required to make existing programs
accessible to the disabled and to
insure \tl\1e attainment of new

Spending   A _

At present, there are roughly 100
disabled students at Pitt.

The disabled often have difﬁculty
getting admitted to elementary
schools throughout the country,‘
Galante said. ’ '

And, if they are admitted, they
often encounter mobility difﬁculty
because architectural barriers such
as streets and curbs are usually
designed without the disabled
person in mind. 0

Jeffery Parker, a . disamed
student, said the University already
has done a good job, not requiredpby
law. of renovating curbs, inclines
and building entrances. .

“We don’t foresee any difﬁculty
with the University meeting the
regulations,” Jack Hayes, director
of veterans affairs _said. “At the
elementary and high school levels
there is more of a problem.”

 

Spring session at Pitt often forces students to choose
between a good tanyand a decent QPA.

d¥Vhile the University has pur-
chased little from Stevens in the
past, “the Chancellor. has asked
that, until further notice, there be
no purchases of products from the J.
P. Stevens company to the extent of
reasonable ability to identify such
products,” according toithe Chan-
cellor’s assistant- secretary Joh
Quatroche. \ '

‘-‘We have a legal obligation to
conform to applicable rules’ and
regulations in the arena of labor
relations,” Qiiatroche said.

The.Pitt Professional Union, the
Union of Graduate Employes, the
National
"Democrats of America, the College
Young Democrats and various Pitt
faculty and staff committees have
encouraged the boycott.

The Student Government Board
(SGB) is considering a boycott »
recommendation and will vote on
the recommendation ‘at their next
public meeting.

“The Stevens company is trying’
to prevent their employes from
forming a union,” SGB member
Chip Hubbard said. “When the
employes do unionize, Stevehs ig-
nores the union and the contract.”

“The working conditions i at
Stevens resemble the conditions of
th_e 18th and 19th century;
unprotected machinery and levels
of dust and cotton particles in the air
far above government standards.”
There is sworn testimony by
employes and former employes
attesting to the unsafe and
unsanitary conditions,” Hubbard
said. “If SGB passes the boycott
recommendation, we will write to
the U.S. Attorney General and
demand he use his power and that of
the justice‘ department I to bring
whatever legal action necessary to
improve condition. We will also
write to the Southern legislators.”

When asked why SGB was
concerned with political issues such

as the Stevens case, Hubbard said, '\_

“this iswjust a stepping. stone to
other political issues on which SGB
will take a position.

(Stevens) is not time-consuming
and all our time, lately has been
taken up by the tuition issue and the
allocations process. We will use
SGB as a political force.”

That is not always‘

This case -

A Penn State would drop.

The SGB will take a political
stance on the Ali case, Hubbard

. said.

. Pitt labor history professor David
Montgomery explained the federal
-government’s actions so far.

“The actions of the federal
government have mainly. been. -
upholding lower court rulings that
Stevens was in violation of several
laws. The federal government has i
reinstated many ‘Stevens’ em-
ployes,” Motgomery said.

The J. P. Stevens company has
been forced‘ to pay $1.3 million to ,
compensate 289 workers who wereci
ﬁred or denied overtime or other‘
benefits for expressing their
support for a union. ’

G

I   Bruce Is Not Enough‘

Jackie Sherrill has left the Chancellor’s Suite in Bruce Hall and
moved to a new home in Oakland, but the last Quadrangle building
will not be uninhabited for long. Thanks to a wise move by the

‘-administration,‘ undergraduates will occupy a newly renovated

Bruce Hall in a year or so.
Though the new accommodations will not, of course, rival those
of the Chancellor’s Suite, they will be a welcome form of partial

" relief to a student population faced with a serious housing shor-

tage.

But no person involved in dormitory administration or planning
should mistake our open-armed acceptance of the new space for a
sign the housing crunch is over. ‘It is not, and students realize as

_ much.

To be sure, -it will.be hard to find and provide additional rooms
on or very near togcampus. Even the most sensibleifolrm of Pitt egr-
pansion is now protested by Oakland"”s citizen “leaders,” with the
recent townhouse adventure a good example of this. And, as
anyone ‘who drives or walks in Oakland knows, there just aren’t
that many areas around that haven’t been covered with five stories
of something. ~ 

But additional measures are urgently needed. The Bruce Hall
conversion will be but a dent in the undergraduate problem. And
to graduate students, who fought for that space, it is perceived as a
setback. ‘ ,

-‘ The administration probably was correct in its assessment the
need for undergraduate housing was “more pressing,” but it

should remembergraduate students in any future plan for dor-

mitory acquisition.

With tuition increases that have come as often as have summer
vacations I recently, Pitt is fast -losing its . reputation as an
educational bargain. A large part of college, especially for under-
classmen, is dormitory life and that chance to leave home. Take“
that away from prospective freshmen, and you rob the school of its
chance! to .land promising young students. In a few years the
University will see the results, and they will not be good no matter
how enormous an honors program is begun. ‘

The University would be advised to do something about this

«problem now, before declining birth rates and increasing tuition

make Pitt just another school with a tall building and a good foot-

ball team.

  Letter to the Editor

Student Criticizes Outsider Policy

I

I am a ﬁrm believer in the useof
Pitt’s few athletic facilities by the
‘area’s children, but surely a
more convenient time could be
alloted to these children. After all,
some consideration should be given
to the paying members ’who do
happen to attend this university;
Saturday morning would be a more
than suitable time for these
youngsters to have their recreation
period, not a Friday night when
some of the students would like to

priest in our "catechism ‘class,
quoting bible verses like a raptured
revolutionary. His name in those
days, as far as I knew, ‘was
Nosev—an appellation undoubtedly

‘in honor of his magnificent

proboscis. Last year, (Vince and
some friends dug a grave on «former
Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld’s lawn. They were
arrested before they ﬁnished, I
think. 

I had heard Vince’s talk before,
and though I take exception to some
of his statictics and disagree sharply
with his contention that legislative
pressure is hopeless, I ﬁnd his
argument for unilateral (if neces-
sary) nuclear disarmament very
compelling. In a nutshell—and
nutshells are notoriously prone to

I over-simpliﬁcation-—-he says that"

insane as unilateral disarmament
sounds, it is no more insane (and no
less practical) than continued
possession of mega-deadly wea-
pons. As much as I don't want to
accept it, I think. he’s right.

Rich Hayden’s presentation on
“the peaceful atom” was a very
different one from Scotti’s talk on
weapons, but it was at least as
effective. Maintaining all along
that one need not be a physicist or
an engineer to understand the
problems 'involved- in nuclear
energy production, Hayden dem-
onstrated an extraordinarily thor-
ough knowledge of his subject via
diagrams and a seemingly endless
stream of reasonable-sounding and
meaningful statistics. Questioned
sharply by a retired General Electric
executive in the audience, Hayden
commanded respect with his
informed and non-rhetorical ans-

When comparing Pitt athletic
facilities to other major university
facilities, Pitt lags far behind. I
have a funny feeling that this letter
won”t get much attention but I
sincerely hope that at least some of
the students who pay a mere $3,000
a year to attend this University will
take note of this problem.

Some of Hayden’s major points:

There are ‘potential safety
hazards, including radiation pois-
oning and terrorist activity, at every)
step in the nuclear fuel cycle, which
encompasses »mining, conversion,
enrichment, fuel fabrication, fuel
use and waste management. With
breeder reactors the danger is
multiplied signiﬁcantly because of
the,need for fuel reprocessing and
the availability of greater amounts
of explodable plutonium.

The environmental impact of.

uranium mining is tremendous.
High grade ore is ‘gone or nearly
gone in the U.S., and in order to
avoid dependence on foreign fuel
sources, huge amounts of low grade
ore will have to be strip-mined.

in Nuclear Energy

A severe nuclear fuel shortage
will begin by the turn of the century,
unless breeder reactors are em-

/ployed. And with problems ranging

from potential terrorism to the
possibility of reactor core explo-
sion (the latter is not a factor in
currently operative light-water
reactors), -breeders are far too
dangerous. ,

Nuclear fuel is lost at an
alarming, thouglr unpublicized
rate, and should the right fuel fall
into the wrong hands, the ease in
constructing an explosive device is
well-known. (And if a terrist group
plants‘a bomb in one of our cities,
our thousands of nuclear warheads
will be as impotent as water pistols.)

No Nukes is Good News

(Continued from Page 4)

Radioactive waste——one of the
world's most powerful poisons-
remains virulent for centuries, and
there is still no proven effective
means of disposal.

Nuclear power is inefficient and
expensive, in terms of energy
generated vs. energy invested. It is
also one of the most capital-inten-
sive and least labor-intensive power
sources available.

Solar energy could provide about
half our total energy needs by the
year 2000. And the difficulties in
solar energy development are
“more social and institutional than
technical”~—meaning, for instance,
that President Carter’s proposed
tax credits for solar heating
installation could be one step
toward alleviating these difficulties.
Another might be a modiﬁcation of
the profit-motive orientation in the
energy industry and among the
utilities.

Conservation is by far the most

efficient energy source we have. ’

Whereas we now get about one unit
of work from ten units of energy, the

elimination of waste could improve

these numbers significantly-

which means that GNP is not as
closely tied to energy consumption
as some would have us believe. But
waste elimination is not always
cost-effective, at least in the near
term, and therefore affects the
proﬁtability of industry and util-
ities. The question becomes one of
priorities.

Energy requirements in the
residential market are relatively
inelastic when compared to savings
potential in industry, so it is from
industry that the most important
conservation measures must come.

If proper conservation methods
are employed and solar energy
development proceeds at a reason-
able pace, the U.S. does not need
further nuclear power develop-
ment, and considering the risks
involved, such development would
be folly.‘ ‘

Looking back on Hayden’s
presentation, I’m not sure it didn’t
lack sufficient emphasis on curbing
our over-consumptive lifestyles.

.marketplace. ’ ’

We can’t continue with the attitude
that an ever-increasing standard of
living is a virtual necessity or we'll
never stop ‘butting our heads
against absolute limits to energy
consumption, no matter how many
sources we develop. And I get the
impression that he underestimates
the potential for energy savings in
the consumer sector, particularly in

the area of personal transpgrtation.

But no matter how many criticisms I
could come up with, I left the lecture
with the impression that the man
knew what he was talking about,

that nuclear energy was the wrong
road to travel. To my ears,

Hayden’s one small voice seemed to
speak louder and more clearly than
all the pro-nuclear voices of the past
several years.

Possibly more important than all

the technical information imparted,

during his hour’s lecture, however,
was somethng Hayden said to me
Just as we were leaving: “The
future has no vote in today’s
He’s right, of
course; it’s our responsibility to
vote for it.

By DAN KACZMARSKI .

The voice from the walkie-talkie

squawked only briefly, but it was‘
enough to send Pitt patrolman‘, ’

Frank Manning; running.

“Two male youths attempting 
bicycle theft on the Fifth Avenue

side of Schenley Hall.”

Manning, who had been walking t

his beat along Forbes‘Avenu_e,
raced through the lobby of the

Student Union, hoping to surprise ’

the pair.
As soon as they saw the:
policeman rushing out of the f

building, the two boys sprang up
and fled in different directions.

‘Manning, »31, a former Marine,

pursued the one who had. hurriedly
dropped a pair of bolt cutters.
The chase ended abruptly near
the Schenley Hall lawn, by
Bigelow Bouldvard, where Man-
ning sent the suspect sprawling
with a crunching cross-body block,
holding him there while other
‘officers rushed to the scene.
’. After arrests were made,‘ a

0 search of one of the would-be

thieves produced a 10-inch knife.

Open and very lethal. Whether it
would have been used had the
opportunity been given is conjec-

“That’s one of the chances you
take," said Manning afterward.
“You realize that if you don’t stay
alert, you could end up on a slab at
the-County Morgue.”
Grisly?

‘cunt GRAHAM ‘
Wilson photo

Maybe so. but to the G109 Pitt
policeofficers responsible for
patrolling the University grounds.
such possibilities, slim as they may
be. are a part of life. Contrary to
the notion of more than a few
University residents, the campus
police do not pass their time
sipping coffee and occasionally
ticketing parked cars.

“I think a lot of people have the
impression we are four or five old
men who sit around and reminisce
about the days when we were real
policemen," said’ campus police
chief Curt Graham. “That's just
not true. ‘We are trained officers_
who do everything the city police
do."

“Everything" runs the gamut

from investigating criminal mis- T
"chief (vandalism) to apprehending
armed robbers. As with any police‘

force, though, the largest percent-
age of the patrolmen’s time is
devoted to more mundane respons-
ibilities.’ .

“Eighty percent of our activities
are service related." said Graham.
“That includes giving directions.

helping out motorists in distress,

   

 

letting people in and out of
buildings and assisting people in
need of medical aid.” '
Almost one-third of the force—
33 patrolmen—is trained in emer-

gency medical techniques (EMT).“

V7

“Eventually, said~Graham,

.“we'd like to have all our officers

trained as EMT’s. When there’s a
call for help, we're usually the first
ones at the scene. Ifind it difficult
to justify a police officer standing
around while someone bleeds to
death."

The importance of trainirig,
varied and extensive, seems to be a
watchword around the police
station. Since 1974, all new officers
have been required to receive 480
hours of schooling at the State
Police Academy.

In addition to this basic training,
many of the ofﬁcers have attended

» courses in more specialized areas

of criminology, ranging from
‘fnarcotics control" to “bomb
search techniques.” ‘

“Sixty percent of our officers are
either college graduates or enrolled
in degree granting programs,”
added Lieutenant Charles West-
brooks, community relations
officer. “What we have here is a
group of trained professionals."

Graham is equally enthusiastic
about the men and women he
supervises. .,

“Four years ago.” he mused, “if
somebody would have asked me to
rate our police force, [would have
had to have said that it was
mediocre. Now, Iwouldn’t hesitate
to say it's the best in the county.
Simply because of the people we
have on the beat." ,

Some people might be surprised
to hear the Pitt police mentioned in
the same breath with the Pitts-
burgh and Allegheny County
forces. To hear virtually anyone
associated with the campus police
tell it. the only significant
difference among the departments
is size.

responsibility,’ said patrolman
Manning, “I'd say it would be
similar to a small municipality
surrounded by a large city.”

All 15 to 25 patrolmen manning
each shift carry guns while on duty.
Those who are assigned, to one of
the 10 patrol cars, the ambulance,
or one of the walking beats
continually wend their way along

movement enough to avoid creat-
inga pattern that couldrbe charted.

Pitt presents a special challenge
to law enforcers because of its
extensive exposure to city streets
and-alleys. Close to 80 percent of
those who attempt an illegal action
on campus are not related to the
University. The large number of

,,.possible escape route available in

many buildings also pose pru-
blems.

Adding to. police headaches is
the University's proximity to ‘a
section of the city which attracts
more than its share of transients.

“On a Friday night,” said
Westbrooks, "our populationvmay
increase by as many as 10,000
people because of the booze joints,
fast-food places and special events
in the area."

Though conceding such times
present increased problems for Pitt
police. Graham noted that there is
no notably “worst” period for
criminal activity.

“When we first started keeping
detailed statistics." said Graham,
“we expected to find that the
campus was safe during the day
and unsafe at night. As it turned
out. we were wrong. The campus
is safe all the time."

This conclusion, said Graham, is
borne out by Pittsburgh police
statistics. which rate the University
area as one of the safest in the city.

committed on campus, which one is

and away, we spend more time
investigating thefts than any other
crime.”

’(Theft differs from robbery in.

that the former involves the taking
of unattended property, white
robbery includes a personal con.
‘frontation with theivictim.)

Brevard is one of four Pitt
detectives who follow up arrests
made by’ patrolmen——accumulating
evidence and arranging court
sessions——and who investigate
criminal incidents in which a
suspect was not ‘immediately
apprehended. He feels that many
theft are avoidable.

“If people, especially women

 

closer eye on their belongings and
not leave them behind when, say.
going to the restroom, you would
have many. less thefts."

Brevard. who bears .a closer
resemblance to somebody's kindly
uncle than to Dirty Harry, takes
special pride in his expertise in
fingerprint analysis. which, , he
says, “is still the surest way of
identifying suspects.”

The human resources of the
campus police are increasingly
being supplemented by aCampus-
wide electronic security and com-
munications system.

Man and machine working

‘ together is nowhere more evident

than in the department's cornmuni-
cations room.

Panels of small lights. computer
viewing screens flashing detailed,
blueprints of alarm systems and
the sporadic bark of faceless voices
from various points around the
campus-create an unified impres-
sion which Graham confirms,
saying, “This is the beginning and
end of~.what we do. All calls start
and end here."

If an individual needs police
assistance and nary a patrolman is
in sight, he or she can contact the
communications room in one of two
ways. By dialing “extension
2121,” the caller will reach the
desk officer. who will record the
information given and dispatch an
officer to the scene.

Even more efficient are the
“emergency phones” and call
boxes that are distributed across

the campus. Lifting the receiver of ‘

any of the phones will put one in
contact with the communications
sergeant and light up one of 96

small bulbs on a control panel.

The Outlaws Storm Onstage at The Stanley

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

What’s so impressive about the
Outlaws, a five-piece band from
Tampa who are building a big
following through grueling touring,
is the way they storm onstage and
immediately grab a crowd by the
throat.

The Outlaws’ guitar-oriented,
high-energy-country rock’n’roll is
fast and hell-raising. A sell-out
crowd of denim-clad fans -‘at the
Stanley Theater Thursday night
loved it as the Outlaws tightened a

.\ pleasurable musical noose around
A them.

There were no frills in the
Outlaws’ stage act, no strobe lights,
no boa constrictors, no theatrics of
any sort-—they just played the guts
out of their guitars.

The heart of the Outlaws’

impressive sound is their two lead

guitarists, the mustashioed Billy
Jones and the frizzy-haired, hard-
stompin’ Hughie Thomasson.

Jones, wearing a crowd-pleasing
Iron City T-shirt, took the spotlight
most often, and his classy,
bluegrass-tinged playing on “Gun-
smoke,” “There Goes Another
Love Song,” and f‘Stick Around for
Rock’n’Roll” was exhilirating.

Thomasson is no slouch himself.
His brutal guitar style provided a
nice contrast,‘ yet blended well with
Jones’ smooth, melodic sound on
their numerous guitar battles and
duets.

Thomasson created the night’s
most moving moment when he
stepped center stage alone. and
announced this heartfelt dedica-
tion:

“This next song is going out for
an Irish friend of ours who is no
longer with us; but...he really used
to like this song.”

The dedication completed,
Thomasson started to strum the
majestic and haunting chords of a
song that was morethan vague-
ly familiar. And there was no
doubt about it when the rest of the
band returned——it was time for
the Outlaws’ showpiece, the soar-
ing guitar-that-broke-thespeed-of-
sound Southern anthem, “Green
Grass and High Tides.”

It’s notoften that a song has the
power to send a pleasurable musical
shiver up your spine. “Green
Grass and High Tides’ ’ does it every
time it’s played. Truly a great tune.

Like “Seagull,” “I1lusions” is a
short book of modified poetry that
will someday make excellent
thoughts for scenic posters. Like

aside, it’s almost the same book

spouts such profound thoughts as,
“Here is a test to ﬁnd whether your
mission on earth is finished: if
you’re alive, it isn’t.”
Undeniably, the words are lovely.
It’s just that Bach, now ﬂying
himself from cityito city in a massive
promotional effort, is saccharine
enough to push an incipient diabetic
over the edge and it’s not even the
real stuff. Bach cranks this gunk out

The Outlaws brought country-rock and some good ole Southern hell‘ raising to 2;
the Stanley Theatre.

Playing a lesser musical role—-
but a larger, crowd rousing
one—was burly rhythm guitar-
ist/vocalist Henry Paul.

Paul is the Outlaw who played up
the “rough and tumble, whiskey
drinking -and hell raising image”
the fans went bonkers over, tipping
his menacing ten-gallon black hat,
and “whooping” it up at the
completion of every song.

The Outlaws are a tight bunch of
Southern boys who like to pose for
pictures displaying their right arms,
which are all tattooed with their
steer head trademark.

Now that may seem corny; but
when you can play music like the
Outlaws, it seems natural and
healthy. Ride ’em, cowboy!

not seem to realize that beautiful
sentiments do not a book make.

Another disturbing factor is the
book’s strong resemblance to Khalil
Gibran’ s “The Prophet. ’ ’ Actually,
more rip-off than resemblance:
Bach is not in Gibran’s class--he
should stick to seagulls.

At least in “Seagull,” Bach
showed a touch of class. This one
seems like it was turned out for the
money and a humanized (deiﬁed)

One reason might have been the
intense heat and humidity inside
the Stanley. It was steaming and
when it’s that uncomfortable, it
takes a band with the stage
presence and musical power of the
Outlaws to make it bearable, let
alone enjoyable.

The only saving grace in this
Cleveland-based quintet’s set of
high-energy rock’n’roll was a nice
solo by the drummer and some
ﬂashy licks by the intelligent lead
guitarist. ‘

When the band came out for the

the way he did it.

From the time‘ that Erving, off
the opening tap, swooped to the
basket for a paralyzing dunk, he
controlled the tempo of a very
bruising confrontation betwee-n
these playoffsurviyors. He was
reminded of the remark that one
fan made entering the Spectrum.

“The 76ers can't lose this series.
Dr. J. won’t let them,” the fan
said.

Erving became the $6 million

scoring, on defense and passing. 1
was‘ trying to maintain a total
consciousness of how I could do the
best for my team. I felt.I had a

chance today (Sunday) .to show all
my skills," said Erving in his
typical low speaking voice.
Erving did call on a lot of his
skills. It's doubtful if he used them
all, because every time you see this
athlete he shows you something

‘ you've never seen before.

Against the Blazers, he drove for’
dunks, popped from outside,
banked shots fronihthe side. He did
his Alley Oop number with Doug
Collins, whereby he stands along-
side the basket and waits for a high
looping pass from Collins. The
ball, and Erving leaping high like a
standing high jumper, arrive above
the rim atthe same time. He
simply pushes it through.

Then, he did his Superman
routine in whichrhe takesoff from
the foul line, literally flies 15 feet
through the air to the basket
holding the ball in one hand, ﬁnally
whippingit through the hoop.

Alley Oop or Superman, the
crowd stands and shakes the
building with its roar of approval.

And when he wasn’t scoring,
Erving harrassed the Blazers on
defense with his quick hands.‘ He

also threw pinpoint passes to
teammates that were converted
into field goals. He kept the
Blazers’ defense off balance by
forcing them to double team him,
which opened options for other
76ers. I ,

Erving, of course. didn’t win the
game alone. Collins scored 30
points. Henry Bibby contributed
nine and keyed the 5 offensive
patterns‘. Centers Caldwell Jones
and ‘Darryl Dawkins did an
excellent job on 6-foot-ll Bill
Walton. despit Walton’s 28 points
and 20 rebounds—l7 on the
defensive boards. '

And Coach Gene Shue gave his
Portland opposite number, Jack
Ramsay, something to think about
when the 76ers had their centers
bring the ball up court. It was an
unorthodox maneuver that forced
the Blazers’ guards out of their
pressure defense.

But the series is far from over. 8

Portland has Walton and iMauriee
