l\londay’s Pitt News said
something about,SFA elections

gbeingf scheduled, for April 22-
;So what?

It_’s a tough’ question to an-
swer. I’Ve heard fraternity"

’m'e'n' piste“ about the value of:
election success. during the next:
-rushing season; I’Ve. heard inde-P’
cpendents declaim concerning the‘,
possibleitriumph of the liberal ele-'

ment.

You gettorecognize that stuff‘
~after so long, and four years is so

long. The best answer I’ve heard

pulled just before we left the

‘polls to go over to Forbes Field

last year. c
“What the hell,” he said,
“This politics is alot of fun.”

And that’s the attitude we’re
taking. Without a sense of hu-
mor, Pitt student politics becomes
something even less important
than the date Heinz Chapel will
be ﬁnished. But if you stand ‘by
and watch the deals and counter-
deals flash back and forth, you’ll
ﬁnd it at least as hilarious as Pop-
eye, perhaps almost as good as
the Katzenjammer Kids.

Sellouts and Stuff

A case in point: in April, 1934,
the Independents, backed by a
coalition of weak fraternities suc-
ceeded for the ﬁrst time in steal-
ing a majority from the Alpha
coalition, which contained ﬁve or
six of the most powerful Greek
houses.

t least they thought they had.
They elected King Derr, SAE, as
president, and things began to roll
smoothly, until something schol-
astic happened to Derr, and vice-
prexy Len Marks, middle—roader,
slipped in. .

Meanwhile the PiKA’s sold ou
to the power houses in exchange
for one Druid and the Junior
Prom chairman, leaving the In-
dependents back in the same old
rut. .

Determined to come back, the
“outs” split the fraternity power
in 1935, and election day revealed
the fact that 11 fraternities and
all the Independents had banded
against the Delts, then, as now
(?), a political Tartar. The new
faction made only one mistake.

‘In The Neck . . .’

-With all its strength, it attempt- '

ed to clean the boards, jam
through ﬁve complete tickets. It
was just too bad that a Phi Kap
and a Kappa Sig thought they’d
only need 100 votes for election.
The Non—Frats were bought off,
a terriﬁc struggle ensued, and
when the smoke cleared away,
Bill Harvey, Delt bigwig, was sit-
ting in the SFA president’s chair.
Sid Friedman, then Phi Ep head,
admits it was his fault in forget-
ting who Leo Ryan was supposed
to vote for, but_the damage was
done. 1 T
Bill McQuade two years ago,
and Al Barr last year, were a
couple of other boys who got it in
the neck, but that’s too long" a
story, and too good a story, not
to save for our next in this series.
Now let’s get down to political
lines for 1938. They’re still pret-
ty well tangled. Here’s the way
they look:
1. The Dents and Al Kairys
(75 votes from Pitt Riﬂes) are

closer than a Pitt-Fordham
game.
2. Bill Stark and Bernie Mc- I

Kenna, Independent stalwarts,
have a long way to go before
they get out of the fog.

3. With Les Hamburg, Phi Ep
leader, vacationing in Florida,
Al Barr, Phi Kap ex-head and
nominal fraternity Fuhrer,
seems to be avoiding a confer-
ence with Stark, who wails:
“But I have to make commit-
ments!” ,

4. Bernie Cashdollar, Phi
Delt, who seems to be the
“marked man,” can’t ﬁgureout

which side of his bread is but-

tered, if any. -

5. And two campus liberals,
with less than their usual bra-
vado, claim they “have the
campus.” _
And there the subject rests, but

not for long.

Mortar Board
Hears Debate

A University women’s debating
team opposed a pair from Gettys-
burg college last Thursday night
before the monthly meeting‘ of
Mortar Board, senior ‘ women’s
honorary, in Heinz House.

Leah Hirsch, ‘C38,? and Hilary
Lurie, C40, comprised ‘the Uni-

SFA Concert Hour will be

today,‘ with excerpts from the
greatest of the Wlagnerian mu-
sic dramas being presented by
means of recordings. Today’s
program will be held _i1_1_2317
Cathedral at 3:80 o’clock.

The \Vagnerian program is
being given in response to re-
quests for a recital of this sort.
Today’s numbers will include the
funeral music from. “Gotterdamm-
erung;” the prelude‘ of act. three
of “Lohengrin;” the Overture to

“Die” ' 'Meistersinger;” and the
“magic ﬁre music” from “Die
Valkure.”

_ PIANIST PLAYS
According to present day sta-
tistics, compiled by the broadcast-
ing companies, Wagner leads with‘
Beethoven and Tchaikovsky in be-

ing presented on the air. The
Metropolitan repertory for this
year included more Wagnerian

performances than operas by any
other composer. This is quite dif-
ferent from the days when “Tris-
tan and Isolde” was called “a
magniﬁcent failure, never to be
repeated.” 1

In addition to the Wagner num-
bers, Majorie Bandman, Carnegie
Tech pianist, will play a piano-
forte sonata by Beethoven.

BACH CANTATA

Completing the program, will
be a chorale from the Bach can-
ltata, “Christ Lay in Death’s Dark
Prison.” Bach is heard most fre-
quently during Lent, as he com-
posed a vast amount of sacred
music in choral form, and is con-
sequently represented in programs
during the week’s preceding East-
er. This particular number was
composed for men and children’s
voices; full orchestra and organ.
It is generally regarded as one of
Bach's greatest cantatas.

Today’s program is open to stu-
dents and members of the faculty.

  Minimized Costﬂf Lung Pictures  F
Will Extend Service To All Students
With Positive Tuberculin Reactions

BULLETIN4At‘2 o’clock yesterday afternoon 691 men.
/ and 214- Women, a. total of 909 students, had taken the free
Tuberculin tests at the student health services.
pected that the 1,100 mark will be passed some time today.

By IVIELVIN ROGOW

It is ex-

X-Ray photos, absolute method of detecting 'l‘ubcrculosis,
are being off'ered to students who have reacted positively to
the Tuberculin test given free to all University students.

Through a plan worked out by the Pitt News, with the co-
operation of the men’s and women’s health services, the or-
dinarily expensive X—ray pictures will be made for students at
éan absolute minimum cost of two

dollars.

The usual rate, according to Dr.
H. C. Carlson, director of the
men’s health service, for taking
chest X—rays-from a private phy-

lsician or a hospital runs between

10 and 15 dollars. The plate alone
costs approximately $5.50, and the
medical services add to the bill.

X-RAYS AT CLINIC

All pictures will be taken at
Falk Clinic. Appointments for
men are to be made with Miss
Dobrick at the Clinic; women, are
to make their appointments with
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director
of the women’s health service.

The Tuberculin test itself is be-
ing offered to all students at no
cost to them. If a negative re-
action results, this is a definite
sign that there is no tuberculosis
present, nor is there any tubercule
baccilis in the skin.

A positive reaction does not
necessarily indicate the presence
of Tuberculosis, but it does indi-
cate that an X-ray photo should
be taken. After the Tuberculin
test has been taken, the health

service doctors advise as to wheth-
er an X—ray is needed.

The X—ray photos will be taken
by skilled stereopticians from the
Falk Clinic. Plates will be read
by Dr. Harold T. Brown, instruc-
tor in medicine, who is connect-
ed with the Tuberculosis League
of Pittsburgh. ' -_ ’ ‘ ’

MINIMUM COST

“The opportunity offered stu-
dents to‘ take these X—rays at an
absolute minimum cost,’_’ said the
men and -women’s health ‘services,

in a joint statement released, to-

day,” is unrivaled. Students may’

ifthey wish, take the X’-rays out-
side the University, but‘they"will-1

find that the amount "to be
will run. close to $15. _

, “«We have men at the Falk Clinic‘
who are among the best in Pitts-,
burgh at taking the X-ray pho-
tos, and Dr. Brown ha_s no su-
perior at reading the films.”

The Tuberculin tests, ﬁrst step
in Tuberculosis detection, will be_
offered today,’ the ‘last time ;this
week. Tests- are being adminis-
tered only on Mondays, Tuesdays

. paid;

. and Wednesdays.

Anti-Tuberculosis Plan
Reaches X-Ray Stage

ATEST report in the progress of the T11-

berculin anti-tuberculosis test campaign
being conducted now on campus reveals that
X-Rays are now available to students who
have shown positive reactions.

The X-Rays will be given at reduced rates
and, by way of congratulating the Student
Health Services and the Tuberculosis League,
we add that they are absolute bargains.

Experts will administer the rays and the best
stereoptican ﬁlm available will be used. The
University and the Tuberculosis League will
absorb most of the expense, thereby bringing
the X-Rays within reach of all who need them.

If you are one of the students who have
been urged to have an X-Ray taken as a re-
sult of your reaction to the Tuberculin Test,
ice the complete story 011 page one.

In the nicantime, all those students Who have
not yet had the opportunity to take a Tuber-
zulin Test may do so today, the last day this
week that the tests will be administered.

Military Ball Ticket
Scalping To Cease

FEVV of the lads in the ROTC, it seems,

have taken advantage of the fact that
there is a limit to the number of tickets avail-
able for the Military Ball Friday night and
have jacked up the price on the ones which
have been available to them for their
“friends.”

We do not wish to moralise on the fact that
this scalping is illegal and, at best, not exact-
ly cricket, and We are glad to note that the
Ball committee will countenance none of it.

If you are one of the persons who has
paid more than three dollars for a ball ticket,
you can get the additional money back by
reporting the fact to chairman Joseph Sob-
koviak or to other members of the Military
Ball committee.

tee see the ‘letter to the editor on this page-

Credo:

Seasons change, but the age—old question of the
content of the college newspaper seems to be ever-
present in an unchanging form.

The purpose of the newspaper, it seems to me,
should be aligned with the poses of liberal educa-
tion. Both should strive to obtain a greater amount
of freedom of thought and understanding for the
students of the institution where they exist.

Both should attempt to teach without indoctrina-
tior. and without pressure. And both should rec-
ognize that the student is not just a part of the
university. but is the most important part of the

ugzersity.

tudents who go to college should be assumed to
be the sort of people who wish to acquire knowl-
edge, no matter the varying extent to which this
aim is present in the individual students.

The University and the newspaper should rec-
ognizze the student: he is an individual interested
not only in particular subjects but also in a general
atmosphere of intelligence, and broadly in af-
fairs outside the area of the campus.

In ﬁlling in the details of its theory, both the
newspaper and the university should recognize that
the only means of obtaining a ﬁnal justiﬁcation in
any View is by free discussion, by an open-mind-
edness. by a general attitude of tolerance to all
viewpoints, and by active democracy.

In addition, the college newspaper should be the
voice of the students, free to accept their com-
ments and attitude at all times.

posed to succeed where a similar conference,
held at Pitt last month, failed.

At that conference, a definite peace policy
around which the strike could be organiged
was not formulated. This coming conference
will be again unsuccessful unless the student
body demands of it a concrete realistic atti-
At the last conference, the discussion
centered around criticism of collective security.

There were several panels: on the philoso-
phy of peace, on economic internationalism, on
student organization. At this conference, a
program has been suggested, by a minority
group to be sure, but accepted nevertheless
without. discussion.

The panels planned for Saturday’s meeting
are ‘Propaganda of VVar,” “Economic Causes
of VVar,” “Preparation for Strike,” and
“Permanent Peace Activities.” These panels
are even more vague than the last, more vague
and rather artificial.

It does not seem rash to say that the Amer-
ican Public is interested, indeed deeply con-
cerned, not over the economic causes or pro-
paganda of war, but over Fascism and its men-
ace to Democracy. They are excited about
I-litler’s inroads in Central Europe, about.
Japan’s imperialist ambitions, about American
Foreign Policy, about President Roosevelt’s
and Secretary Hull ’s statements.

The peace strike is the beginning of our
ﬁght for peace at the University. ‘Ne must
not only support it, but we must also make
uire that it  not wasted, that its stands are not
vagiie and theoretical.

lii every civilized country the students are
looked to as defenders of culture, of their
country’s best tradition. Student movements
in Japan, China, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia
are the loudest protest against the cruel oppor-
tuiiitism of war makers.

\Ve can join students the world over. At this
conference and at the strike, we can justify our
existence as students and as lovers of peace.

Swing is here to sway! As practically everyone
from Ferdinand the Bull to Little Red Riding Hood
has ventured opinions on the subject, we might as
well have our innings, because we like it.

Swing is fun, because it stirs even the most sober,
respectable citizens to a mild hop-skip—and—jump.
In fact, the American public has been stricken with
a swing fever that threatens to be the Sway of all
Flesh. Dance floors are beginning to sag all over
the place because Aunt Agatha and Uncle Bonzo
are joining the procession of “jitterbugs” and
“ickeys.”

Most demonstrative of this was the recent jam
session in the Paramount Theatre in New York
when Benny Goodman and his band beat it out.
The "’jitterbugs” got out into the aisles and jittered
frantically, while the “ickeys” remained ecstatic in
their seats.

Whether or not this fervor will last, we hesitate
to prophesy. But we rather suspect that when the
fervor is gone, the malady will linger on.

Swing To Culture .

Now that the jam session is over, we can swing
up the scale in the realm of music. We are per-
turbed no end because with Bizet’s “Carmen” last
Saturday this season’s series of broadcasts from
the Metropolitan Opera House in New York were
completed.

Those who have not heard the glorious voice of
Kirsten Flagstad ascend into an aria of “Die

role of Mimi in “La Boheme,” or listened to the
diminutive Lily Pons bring a hardened New York
audience up on its brogans at the performance of
“Lucia Di Lammermoor” have missed out on some-
thing intellectually ﬁne and inspirational.

Some Fun

Too, we were dismayed when that great conduc-
tor, Arturo Toscanini ﬁnished his series with the
NBC Symphony. Maestro Toscanini conducted an
all-Wagnerian program for his last concert. It be-
gan with that beautiful prelude to the ﬁrst act of
“Lohengrin” and ended with the stirring “Ride of
the Valkyries.”

Frankly, we would walk more than the proverbial
mile to hear an entire program devoted to the com-
positions of Richard Wagner.

Well {T/iiniz. . .

Editor, The Pitt News:

The current question on campus seems to be,
“Where can I get a ticket for the Military Ball?”
The equally current answer is, “You can’t get one
anywhere for less than $5.00.” Why does this un-
fortunate situation exist? Is it because the Military
Department wants to help the ROTC boys earn
their way through college by the “scalping plan”?
Not at all. It exists because a few disloyal gentle-
men (so called), some of whom are in the ROTC,
some of whom are not, have found it possible to
gather together Military Ball tickets and sell them
at a premium.

It was, and still is, the object of the Military
Department to have a dance for the Reserve Corps
and its guests. Each man was entitled to one
ticket for himself and one for his guest, if he want-
ed one. The freshmen were not permitted guest
tickets since this would enlarge the crowd beyond
comfortable proportions. Every attempt is being
made to curb the selling of Ball tickets to the high-
est bidders. This scalping does not have the sanc-
tion of the Military Ball Committee or the Depart
ment of Military Science and Tactics. —

It is hoped that the general impressions prevail-
ing on the campus will be somewhat changed, and
that no person will pay more than the regular $3.00
for a tickets no matter how much he likes Wayne
King.

Railroads:

Latest Depression Again
Causes Financial Crisis

By Joseph M cCIoskey

During the last depression,
a great battle against mounting

the American railroads fought
deﬁcits and appeared to be on

the way to a genuine recovery when the present depression

wiped out their narrow margin

and brought them face to face

with the gravest crisis in their history.
The story of the railroads during the last‘ two decades has

been the story of a great industiy¢

which has failed to adjust to a new
economic environment.

Closely regulated by the federal
government, tied down by tre-
mendous capitalizations and much
obsolete equipment, and rendered
inefficient by the duplicate facili-
ties built during the boom days,
the railroads have been unable to
meet the competitive pace set by
the truck, the bus, and the auto-
mobile.

Those two point to the eﬂiciency
of the federal operation of the rail-
roads during the War and rec-
ommend that the government take
over the railroads permanently,
tend to overlook the fact that the
problems of the railroads must be
met no matter who owns them, for
there would be little gained by
simply transferring railroad de-‘
ﬁcits to the general debt of the-

United States. !

MOTOR TRUCK COMPETITION?

Nor will such gestures toward’
modernization as the recent epi-
demic of streamlining sufﬁce to
pull the roads out of the doldrums.
What the railroads need is a gen- -
eral and thorough overhauling,
not a new coat of paint.

The railroads should be recog-

nized for what they are——the
safest, best, and most efficient
means of long distance hauling

available in America today.

Their utility for short-hauling
has gone down in face of the ver-
satility of the motor truck. John
L. Keeshin of Chicago, one of
Amcrica’s leading truck opera-

L

tors, takes advantage of his real-
ization of this fact by loading his
trailed units on Rock Island ﬂat-
cars and sending them to their
destination where they are taken
off by a waiting tractor.

Their contents are then dis-
tributed to their assigned places
and Mr. Keeshin has taken ad-
vantage of railroad promptness
and dependability and at the same
time has avoided the cost of un-
loading and reloading his trucks.

HIGHWAY COMPLAINTS

Possibly the railroads could
adopt this sort of cooperation as
a program and ﬁnd therein their
salvation. But such a program
would entail the scrapping of
much equipment, and the dis-
placement of many men employed
on the numerous feeder lines
which the railroads now operate
at a loss. And the idea of dis-
placing men is not attractive when
the army of unemployed surpass-
es ten million in number.

Such a program would have
deﬁnite advantages, however.
Many of the displaced men could
find new employment in an en-
larged trucking industry and in.
the plants of truck manufacturers.
Stricter federal control of the
trucking industry would be neces-
sary and would eliminate much
unsafe and obsolete equipment.

And, if the trucks could be sent
by rail rather than by highway,
the present complaints against

trucks on our highways could be

eliminated.

Ice Critic Writes

A Letter

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports FA'1lt0l'

Monday evening.
Dear Boss :

It’s too bad you have to
lock up the page Tuesday aft-
ernoon. That Tuesday hockey
‘game is going to be the one.
Anyway, here are my sentiments
‘on. what happened in that mem-
-orable first game . . .

4! * #3
IMPRESSIONS: The play-off
hockey game this evening

was a typical Pitt-Duke “Thril-
‘ler-Diller” Honors were
about even-——except for the goal—-
with Pitt spending most of th.e
time in Duke territory while the
Dukes, paradoxically, had more
scoring chances . . Vance’s win-
ing goal was a beautiful piece of
work He skated the length
of the ice getting past Lenny
Broido’s lunging body-check, pul-
led Bud Ellis out of the nets with
a feint and scooped the puck in
"behind him . The best goalie
in the business couldn’t have stop-
ped that one.
* * *

STARS: Bud Ellis shared the
‘hero-role with Vance . Time
and again Bud came out of the
nets to smother the puck with no
one but himself left for a de-
fense . . One time in. particular
Ellis outsmarted the Duke’s Mc-
Gill The Duke wingman
took a pass from Vance and skat-
ed squarely in front of the Pitt
net He made two separate
feints at Ellis, expecting him to
come out as he did several times
‘before, but Bud refused to be
fooled and McGill lost his chance
as he overskated the mouth of the
net.

* =l< =14

INSIDE STUFF: Coach Mc-
Sorley thought the whistle blew
for an offside penalty just before
Vance made the fateful goal . .
It’s a cinch no one in the stands
could have heard it as the place
was a bedlam . A few Du-
quesne Garden ice—guards—the
fellows who clean the ice between
periods and play a lot of hockey
loetween-times—-—were in the Pitt

dressing room after the game and ‘

claimed Duquesne had it on Pitt
when it came to condition . . .
‘They may have been right as this
was Pitt's third game within five
days while the Dukes had the
previous week to rest The
John Carroll game last Friday
night in Cleveland, especially took
a lot out of the players.
* * *

BEEF: Mr. Claire Burckey of
the Pittsburgh Press sports staff
published his all—city team last
Monday and came in for a lot of
argument, which, by the way, he
must have expected . . Burckey
placed four Dukes and only two
Panthers on the first team, rele-
gating our Captain Schooley to the
second team . Burckey ex-
pected an argument because he
spent two paragraphs justifying
his choice of McGill over Bob
. . . We won’t argue that point
but we think Burckey could have
given Schooley a defense post
. . . Bob played a lot of defense
the first half of the season . . .
If Burckey could have seen
Schooley playing John Carroll’s
great Arsenault to a standstill at
Cleveland last Friday night with
vicious body-checks while playing
defense, and remembered McGill’s
corresponding play against the
same gentleman in their last
meeting he would think a little
. . . However,, it’s an empty
honor and no one realizes it more
than the players themselves, as
was evident last Monday in the
play-off game when the Dukes
played two men on Schooley with
fine disregard to Burckey’s opin-
ion.

* IR 3

By the time you read this, the
play-offs will be completed. In.
case you don’t see me Wednes-
day, just realize that my last
half-buck was on the Panthers.

By capturing two new inter-
collegiate titles and placing
four men in runner—up posi-
tions, Pitt’s mightiest ring team
annexed its first Eastern Con-
ference Ltle the past weekend
at Morgantown, ‘West Virginia.

Jed Curzi, Pitt/s 145—pound
larruper, turned the tables on
Tony Guida of Temple and de-
throned the defending champion.

Ray Bombe, who has been box-
ing in the 15.3 and 165 division,
tried his fists in the lower weight
and carried off top honors when
he topped “Battlin’ Bill Basso,
W&J’s captain. After battling
three even rounds, the boys were
put through one extra stanza in
which Ray got the upper hand.

The only bitter note in the vic-
tory was the surprising defeat
of Ralph Dorand. Ralph, like
Guida, failed to hold on to the
championship which he secured
last year.

Captain Caruso, 135, Johnnie
Wargo, 125, Sammie Rosenberg,
115, and Paul Ashmann, 165,
slugged their way to the ﬁnals.

Captain Ralph, by virtue of a
victory over Ballard of Temple,
met Falco of Temple in the title
bout but lost a closely contested
bout.

Johnnie Wargo slugged past
Miller, the West Virginia man and
ran up against Stephenano, the
Bucknell 125-pounder, who out-
pointed him for the second time
this year.

Sammy Rosenberg. 115, starting
his ﬁnal match threw leather
against Nicky Glenn of Temple in
the ﬁnals. Glenn however was
given the winning nod.

Paul Ashmann, 165, drew a bye
in the semi—ﬁnals, but found the
going tougher in the last rounds
when he lost to Sammy Little-

. page.

Other men who represented
Pitt were Lupey Luppinnacci, and
Bill Hickman. Both men lost to
their opponents, Bonﬁli and Dick-
erson who were the only past
champs to retain their togas.

The ﬁnal team standings were
Pitt, 22 points, Temple, Bucknell,
and West Virginia 13 markers,

. and VV&J, 3.

Hospitalization
In Forum Talk

Community-wide group hos-
pitalization will go far toward
easing the burden of sickness
in many American middle—class
families, in the opinion of Mau-
rice J. Norby, executive direc-
tor of the Hospital‘ Service as-
sociation of Pittsburgh, who ad-
dressed Inquiry Forum Monday.

Explaining the program of com-
munity-wide “free-choice” group
hospitalization, which is the basis
of the recently—inaugurated plan
including 14 hospitals of the Pitts-
burgh district, Mr. Norby assert-
ed that it is the best method yet
devised to enable the average
family to~meet hospital costs.

NON-PROFITS GROUP

“Hospitals have been in a pecu-
liar ‘position; .in this country.
They have been able to provide
all the services that the people
need, but many families just
haven’t been able to pay for hos-
pital care,” he said.

Like other group hospitalization
plans in 63 other cities of the
United States, the Hospital Serv-
ice association of Pittsburgh is a
non-proﬁt group, with each sub-
scriber making regular monthly
payments to the general fund
from which all expenses are met,
explained Mr. Norby.

‘REALLY BIG BUSINESS’

“It’s a business, and a really
big business, collecting small
amounts of money from large
numbers of "people to spread the
cost of the hazards of hospitaliza-
tion,” he declared.

Group hospitalization plans now
in operation have enrolled over
1,500,000 people, and extend care
valued at 30,000 dollars daily, he
claimed. About 600,000 are par-
ticipating in the New York City
plan.

“This service has changed in
no way the existing relationship
between doctor, patient, and the
hospital,”_ said-Mr. Norby. “We
accept your f doctor’s judgment.
The patient enters the hospital
when the doctor says so, and re-
ceives a receipted bill when he
leaves.’’

from now until ,

OY CARNEGIE McKENNA,

publican ticket.

Spring Election

Fourteen voting machines
have been procured from the
Allegheny county Bureau of
Elections for use in the spring
elections Friday, April 22, an-
nounces Albert Barr, BA38,
SFA vice-president ond chair-
man of the election board.

Elections will be conducted
in Memorial Hall for 30 positions
in the SFA Assembly, 10 posts in
Men’s Council, and the four of-
ﬁcerships of the College Associa-
tion Cabinet.

MACHINES USED

The I4 voting machines, four
more than were used in last year’s
election, will be used in balloting
for SFA positions. According to
Men’s Council president John
Glasser, BA38, paper ballots will
again be used in the Council elec-
tion.

Petitions for nomination to of-
ﬁces in SFA, Men’s Council, and
College Association will be avail-

‘, able this week and next week.

SFA and Men’s Council petitions
may be procured in the dean of
men’s office, 809 Cathedral, and
CA petitions in the College office,
204 State hall.
BARR EXPLAINS
SFA petitions, signed by 25 stu-

day, April 4. Deadline for Men’s

day, April 1.

Reasons for not holding the
elections in the Cathedral, as ex-
plained by Barr, are: _

1. The Commons Room is too
large a site, _and elections would
prove too difﬁcult to control there.

2. Oother locations on the ﬁrst
and ground floors are too small
and would cause undue crowding.

Roy Carnegie. McKenna, alum-
nus of the University, has an-
nounced his candidacy for nomin-
ation as representative to Con-
gress from Westmoreland County
on the Republican ticket. I

Mr. McKenna graduated from

the School‘ of Engineering in 1903.
He was amernber of the original
Alumni Council, governing -body.
of the General Alumni Association
and was president of the Alumni"
Association in _1922, and at pres-
ent. is a member of the Board of
Trustees of the University. '

Mr. McKenna is president of the
Vanadium-Alloys Steel Company,
which has its works in Latrobe.
He has been associated with this
organization since 1915.

For many years he has been in-
terested in alumni activities, and
“has been one of the most loyal
and generous” of the alumni of the
University. Every Charter Day,
February 28, he gives a luncheon
for the Varsity Letter Club and
friends of the University.

In the announcement of his can-
didacy, Mr. McKenna states, “As
an independent manufacturer I
have practiced the principle of fair
treatment to labor; I have been
favorable to reasonable and sane
legislation; to the principles of so-
cial security, old age pensions and
non—employment insurance.

‘.‘As in the present crisis there
are many citizens who are fearful
concerning the orderly continu-
ance of constitutional government,
it is in the interest of harmony I
pledge my cooperation with all
who believe in the American sys-
tem of government, with free and
equal opportunity to conduct busi-
ness and to provide employment,
with a minimum government in-
terference.

“I conﬁdently believe that the
people of Westmoreland County
realize that any legislation bene-
ﬁcial to business is also beneﬁcial
to labor and agriculture.”

Nine Students
Receive Keys

Nine students have been award-
ed keys for services in the Univer-
sity demonstration block that has
worked for the past two years at
football games.

The awards were announced by
D. C. Schultz, BA38, and William
B. McKenna, BA38, co-chairmen

A key honors were two years’ serv-
ice as a section leader or commit-
tee member, and outstanding per-
formance during the period.
Students to receive the keys
may obtain them from Miss Beat-
ty in 809 Cathedral. The nine
awardees are: Betty Adams, C38;
Thomas Bricker, C38; Walter Ca-
valier, C38; John Danton, C38;
‘Ralph Dempsey, E38; Edwin F.
Ellis, C39; Doris Grennan, C38;
William McKenna, BA38; and D.
C. Schultz, BA38. ‘

By ROBERT ADAMS

Seldom noticed by the aver-
age student visiting one of the
fourth, ﬁfth, or sixth floor rooms
of the Cathedral library is the
faint click which sounds within a
second or two after he has_enter—
ed the room.

But the clicking of the attend-
ance counters operated by the li-
brary attendants during the past
semester has served to record a
surprising increase in the use of
the library by University students.
During the ﬁrst‘ semester, libra-
ry attendance increased 46 per
cent and circulation increased 34
per cent over the same period last
year, according to statistics for the
lending department released by
Mrs. Helen H. Downs, lending li-
brarian.

Attendance in the lending divi-
sion, which includes the delivery
hall, reserve book room, Alldred
room, and men’s and women’s
reading rooms, totaled 111,240 for
the ﬁrst semester. A total of 64,241
books were taken out by Univer-
sity students during that period.
“Nearly all students are using
the library much more this year
than theydid last year,” explains
Mrs. Downs. “Last year, the‘Ca-
thedral library was in its ﬁrst year
of use, and many students were
overwhelmed by its newness.
They were just beginning to ﬁnd
their way around the library.

“Now that --most students have

\

had a year to become acquainted
with our library departments,
they’ve begun to take advantage
of the opportunities here. We of
the library staff want students to
be at home in the library and to
feel free to ask questions about
any phase of it. We’re always
glad to help—that’s our business.”
Two out of every three full-
time University students register-
ed in the Cathedral library during
the ﬁrst semester, ﬁgures compiled
by Mrs. Downs reveal: '
The total of 3,622 students reg-
istered includes 79 per cent of all
students in the School of Business
Administration, 78 per cent in the
School of Education, 75' per cent
of College and Graduate School
students, but only 26 per cent in
the Schools of Engineering and
Mines. .
January was the busiest month
of the ﬁrst semester for borrowing
from the library, with 17,590
books being taken out. This is a
6,000 increase over the circulation
in January, 1937 and more than
1,000 above the previous monthly
record of 16,210, set last October.
Students seem to be acquiring
a taste of the “browsing” atmos-
phere of the sixth ﬂoor Alldred
room, for during the ﬁrst semes-
ter, attendance was 100 per cent
over last year, and circulation
was up 400 per cent. Over 5,000
students visited the room during
that time.
