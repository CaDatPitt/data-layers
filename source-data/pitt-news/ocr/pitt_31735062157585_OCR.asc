Congress Social Committee
Establishes Fuller Program

The new Student Congress Social Committee has completed its

ﬁr'st- step in creating a full social program for the university.
Fox has been appointed its ﬁrst chairman.
, The University Social Commit-1)

tee gave the group a vote of con-
ﬁdence in permitting them to
grant special privileges in social
matters. This provision will be
included in the basic social regu-
lations as decided by the com-
mittee.

These priveleges, however, will
be subject to the approval of the
University Social Committee. The
chairman of the committee, Dean
Biddle, may ‘act in behalf of the
Student Congress group if he de-
sires.

As one of its ﬁrst duties the So-
cial Committee has secured a
change in weekday social hours
for students of the Pharmacy
School. ’

Since Pharmacy students are
required to complete 2500 hours
of apprentice training, mostly

Dave

over the weekends, this change
will enable them to carry on a
larger social schedule._

Social functions will now be al-

lowed to continue until midnight"

instead of the former deadline at
10 p. m.

Late breakfast privileges have
been granted to university groups
following a major social event.
Each organization may exercise

' this right at least once per semes-

ter.

The Social Committee is also
compiling a social handbook to
serve as a guide in planning such
events.

Besides rules, and regulations
this book will contain publicity
aids, check list of dance arrange-
ments, and tax regulations.

Audiology ept.
Plans Finished

Plans forthe formation of an
audiology department have been
completed by the University Med-
ical School. The new department
will locate in the Eye and Ear
Hospital.

Dr. Leo G. Doerﬂer, formerly
instructor of audiology at North-
western University, has been
named director of the department
and will also take a post as assist-
ant professor of audiology in the
School of Medicine.

Clinical audiologist In the new
setup will be Miss Charlotte Av-
ery, former assistant professor of
education at Michigan
State Normal College.

Funds for the establishment of
the department came, in a large
part, from a grant from the Sarah
Mellon Scaife Foundation.

Dr. Doerﬂer, who served‘ as

“acoustic officer at Deshon Gen-

eral Hospital in Butler, Pa., ex-

plained that audiology is a rela-

tively new ﬁeld and that it re-
ceived its impetus from work per-
formed in aural rehabilitation cen-
ters in the armed forces during
the war. . . ~

He went on to explain that
when the otologist cannot restore
hearing through medical or sur-
gical means, the audiologist takes
over, integrating the phases of
rehabilitation after hearing loss.

Two main phases of the depart-
ment’s work are audiological re-
search and community service. '

Dr. Doerﬂer pointed out that
how we hear is still a matter of
theoretical speculation and in-
formed guess work. It is hoped

that the combined efforts of "the

audiologist and the otologist may
throw additional light on the sub-
ject. . '

Hearing analysis and hearing

aid evaluation as well as training‘

in beginning speech and lip read-
ing will be offered for the deaf.

A HAND FOR _THEVBAND

In recent years students and other spectators at football
games have gone wild over the incredible -stuff the band pulls
off in its before-game and half-time “presentations. This en-
thusiasm is more than justiﬁed, because the band is an in-
credible outﬁt, pulling oﬁ formations and stunts that are more
than incredible.

During the “lean years" of football here,‘now over we
hope, many students said they attended football games more

This enthusiasm extends beyond the stadium. Students

times don’t take into considerationthe fact that the band is

And remember the rally the Monday after the Penn State
game? All the band marched“ up to Flagstaff Hill in the driv-
ing rain, while only a minute fractﬁn of the student body
braved the downpour. . '

The point to all this is that the band is presenting its
annual Stadium Review tomorrow night in Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall.

It might be a good thing if the student body were to

We wouldn’t like to think that student appreciation of the-.

Editor, The Pitt News: _

In reference to an article which
appeared in this paper Dec. 3, re-
garding the reactions of column-
ist Myron Kopelman to -an Open
House Chancellor Fitzgerald held
for sophomores. we have one ques-
tion to ask. Do you on the News
know where good taste ends and
ignorance begins?

Your columnist made various
and sundry complaints about the
tea. These complaints were ‘swal-
lowed with a grain of salt. How-
ever, we ran out of salt when, in
speaking to the Chancellor,-your
writer slaps him on the back and

.says, “How in the hell are edu-

cational trends today, Chancellor?”

[Ed. Note: Mr. Kopelman never
slapped a chancellor on the back,
nor made the above statement at-
tributed to him.]

We have no idea how Chancel-
lor’Fitzgera1d feels about the ref-
erence, but we couldn’t blame him
if he didn’t think too highly of

' the character who penned it.

What we are asking, Mr. Editor,
is that your Mr. Kopelman dis-
play, at least, a bit-of respect the
next time. In the interest of good
taste, we hopegthe News, as the
ofﬁcial student organ, questions
the inclusion of such articles in
the future.

Yours" in the interest of respect

L toward authority,

Jeanne Ditz, Virginia Reynolds,
Ruth Raupp, Katie Gaskin.
[Ed. Note: The writers of the
above letter are members of
Senior Court, sponsor of the-
tea.]

twice a week,‘ think rehearsals “fun rather

than work,” and show their
switching from Bach fugues

Until this ' semester the singers
were enlisted from the Women’s Chor-

Coeds in Need of I inspiration
As Interclass Sing Approaches

Pitt women will go into a trance until Jan. 14.

Reason is that traditions committee has decided on
Dreamland” as the theme for Interclass Sing.

The sing is one of the leading competitions of the year. Women
of each class give their interpretation in words and music of the
particular theme.

Highlight of the Sing is a skit given by the faculty judges who
¢haven’t as yet been chosen.

Winner of the sing will be
given a gold cup inscribed with
the class year. Any class keeping
the cup three years in succession
receives permanent possession.
‘Chairmen of the Sing for this
year are Jeanne Ditz, freshmen;
Bunny Golomb, sophomore, Shir-
ley Levine, junior; and Carol
Becker, senior.

Originally scheduled for Dec.
14, the Sing was postponed until
Jan. 14 to give the coeds more
time for preparation.

To receive increased subsistence
allowance for newly acquired de-
pendents, student vets should no-
tify the Veterans Administration
regional office immediately.

Increased subsistence payments
begin from the date the VA is no-
tiﬁed and are not retroactive to
date on which the dependent was
acquired, the VA emphasized.

The veteran’s notice should be
accompanied by legal evidence of

band was voted ‘Best of 1948’ re-
cently by Look Magazine, and will

Bill Sausser, IF social chairman
reports that 18 fraternity sweet-
hearts will steal the show from
the bands during the evening
when they are officially crowned
as the respective fraternity dream-

An innovation in Pitt affairs,
permission has been granted the
men to serve breakfast to their
dates following the dance. After
the last dance, greeks and dates
will adjourn to the respective fra-
ternity houses for ham and eggs

Charity Shot
Decides Game

By BOB VAN ATTA

Dr. ll. C. Cal-lson’s current.
Pitt basketball edition showed
some excellent. and some ex-
tren1el_v poor basketball when
it nipped Bethany’s Bisons,
65-64, at the Stadium pavilion
Saturday evening.

The underdog Herd had appar-

ently not read the papers here-
abouts, nor did they do much to
indicate that the writers who
gave the Panthers a big edge were
right.

Twice in the last half, Pitt blew
10-point leads—probab1y the ﬁrst
time a Carlson troupe. has done
that——with the last slump nearly
fatal.

Peter Lead Away

With four minutes left, the Pan-
thers held an apparently comfort-
able 62-52 edge, but nobody told
the Bisons they weren’t supposed
to win. “_

Stubby southpaw Ed Martin
and Bethany sparkplug Jim Mew-
hirter each caged a free throw
over a two-minute period which
saw home passers George Hrom-
anik and Bimbo Cecconi, then
Martin and Mewhirter leave the
game on personals.

John Vujnovic and Walt Dynow
added two more charity ﬂings to
close the gap to 62-56. Don Har-
ris connected from long range,
then Dynow converted the foul
that exited Panther Dodo Can-
terna with 1:20 remaining.

Pitt’s favor, with 60 seconds left.

A corner shot, by the visitors’
Stu Mayer 14 seconds later closed
the gap to one point. Panther
Mike Belich stretched it to two
when Bison Karl Grizzell fouled
out, but Harris cherry—picked the
tying ﬁelder with 32 seconds left.

With 12 seconds left, Harris
fouled Belich, and the Duquesne
sophomore calmly converted the
winning point.

Mewhirter Outstanding

Coach Glenn Johnson’s Herd
held an 11-point edge at one stage
in the first half which was dom-
inated by the outstanding ﬂoor
play and leadership of Bison cap-
tain Mewhirter, who played de-
spite a silghtly sprained ankle.
His 20 points were but one phase
of the Avalon lad’s play that made
a game of the tilt.

Brief surges of
“Figure-Eight” proﬁciency by the
Carlsonmen which cut Sammy
David, Hromanik, and Lerner
loose for layups sliced the early
Bethany lead and gave the win-
ners 48—38 and 62-52 margins
which they ﬂoundered away.

the badminton title'to their foot-
ball crown.

' Upsetting the favored PiKA
quartet last Thursday, 2-1, in the
ﬁnal match, the Fijis captured
their second IM toga of the year.

At the close of the deciding tilt,
L. C. Bemis, director of IM ath-
letics, revealed that the past sea-
son, the first of its kind since the
war, ‘was one of the most success-
ful.

Saddlers, 42-4

By DAVE POLLOCK

The Pioneers rode the Saddlers
into the hardwood at Trees gym
Thursday, winning by the lopsid-
ed score of 42-4. It wasithe ﬁrst
game of the year for both teams
in the Coast league. . .

Scoring at will, the Pioneers ra
up a 28-4 score at half—time. They
resorted to a control type of game
in the second half and held the
Saddlers scoreless in doing so.

Jack Mach led the Pioneer at-
tack with 11 points. Eppley and
Bob Bestwick were close behind
with 8 points apiece.

Only lVIcMeek and Mayer were

' ‘able to score for the Saddlers,

each garnering a ﬁeld goal. Play-
ing without substitutions, the Sad-
dlers tired badly in the second-
half.

The Indians hung-up their ﬁrst
scalp of the year Thursday, by
downing the Pharmacy, 32-25, in
another Coast league game.

Both teams were ragged in their
ﬁrst appearance, but the Indians’
more accurate shooting gave them
the well-deserved victory.

‘Jumping into the lead from the

opening whistle, the Indians were
never in danger except for a mild
Pharmacy ﬂourish in the ﬁnal
quarter. A

With ﬁve minutes left in the
ﬁnal uarter, the Pharmacy pulled
to wi hin four points of the In-
dians, 26-22. But two rapid bas-
kets by Jim Gallagher took the
Indians out of danger.

Swish Stein of the Indians led
the scorers with 12 points. Bob
Shindler topped the Pharmacy at-
tack with 11 points. Floyd Hol-
stein’s all-around ﬂoor game was
a standout for the Indians win-
ning attack.

Stern Picks Nick
As All-American

Nick Bolkovac, Pitt’s 212 pound
tackle, has become a ﬁrst string

All-American in his ﬁrst year of
collegiate football. He was se-
lected on Bill Stern’s movie team
which came to local screens the
middle of last week.

Stern has never seen Bolkovac
play, but then very few All-Amer-
ican‘ selectors ever see many -of
the men they pick. The movies
only showed pictures of Stern’s
backﬁeld, but the names of the
linemen appeared on the screen.

The fast-becoming-famous Nick
appeared some two weeks ago on
local screens, his touchdown run
against Penn State having been
ﬁlmed.

Pitt Tankers Competed
In AAU Meet atYMHA

First competition of the 1948-49 season for the Pitt swimmers
will be offered Sunday, Dec. 19, at the YMHA at 8 p. m.. _

Coach Ben Grady has entered six varsity men in the junior AAU
meet sponsored by the Allegheny Mountain Association. In addition,
several junior varsity‘ members and freshmen will compete in the
Oﬁve events. ‘

_In the 150—yard individual‘
medley, Paul Brugger, captain of
the Pitt squad, and Dick Petrio
are entered.

Bill. Cochran, ace backstroker,
competes in his specialty, a 150-
yard junior event. _

Freshman Dave Huston is the
best bet in the two junior fre_e
style events. _Var_sity free-stylers
Don Wilde and Ed Bruener will
also be on hand to fortify the
100-yard event.

The only open event is the 100-
yard breaststroke in which Bob
McHale is the foremost Pitt entry.

Many of the varsity natators
are unable to swim in the junior
events because they are former
AAU -winners, automatically Edis-
qua.l.ifying them from further
junior competition in their spe-
cialities. ' ’ “
