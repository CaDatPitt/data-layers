Talking politics at Pitt  
WTAE anchor brings media bias to the forefront

Asst. News Editor

By Julie D. Hannon ~

News anchor Scott Baker doesn’t try to sugarcoat his
business. In fact, he’s the first to admit that the media is
biased. So biased, he said, he “was forced to jump into the
ring” and make a difference.

The WTAE evening news anchor believes so strongly in
reporting accurate, balanced news that he abandoned what
seemed to be a promising political career, first as a student
leader at Wheaton College and then as a political organizer
for Ronald Reagan’s 1994 presidential campaign, to report
rather than make the news. _

“A lot of politicians are angry with the mediaand rightly
so,” Baker told a handful of students at last night’s College
Republicans meeting held in David Lawrence Hall. “But the
thought occurred to me that I could do it better. And that’s
the way I see it, that’s what I tell those who complain — get
in there and do it better or stop complaining.” A

Baker said he remembers well the first time he questioned
the tactics of a reporter in thenewsroom.

‘ “A prominent CBS correspondent, who’s still there, -I
might add, went walkingthrough the newsroom and looked

problem.”

 

up to the monitor to a picture of Oliver North and said, ‘We
won’t stop until we string you up’ and just kept on walk-
1ng.” . ‘ _
Blatant incidents of bias in the newsroom like that are
what have made Baker_dedicated to solid day-to-day jour-
nalism, the kind that informs people about daily life, like
the school board meetings and the town meetings.

He admits that it's emotion that draws the public's atten-
tion and doesn't deny that Pittsburgh stations indeed use that
to their advantage. Instead, he says a good station knows
not to cross the line.

“I look at it as there’s a lot to fix,” said Baker. “Electronic
media is very powerful. TV news especially is a headline
service, and reporter’s aren’t there to convince but to bring
balance and insight to the issues.”

Balance should come from a man who reads seven news-
papers a day, watches a minimum of five hours of TV a day
and subscribes to 42 magazines a month.

“I lead an information lifestyle because I think it’s impor-
tant,” says Baker. “But the elite in the media who are
reporting for the people who don’t live that lifestyle also
need to realize who they are reporting for. That’s ‘part of the '

ACLU questions freedom of speech on Internet

By Russ Krebs
Stat?’ Wn'ter

The next time you are looking at naked pic-
tures on the Intemet, consider the fact that the
government is trying to make this viewing
punishable by a ﬁne of up to $250,000.

Kurt Saunders, an adjunct professor at
Duquesne University’s School of Law, led an
open fonim on the topic of free speech on the
Intemet at the Beehive last night This event,
titled “You Can’t Say That On The Intemet,”
was sponsored by the American Civil Liberties
Union and was part of an ongoing series there.

“Should we consider the Internet print or
electronic media?” This was one of the ﬁrst
questions posed by Saunders last night while
he moderated the forum. .

Saunders asked this important question
because ‘print and broadcast media -are treated

differently by the courts when considering
freedom of speech issues. He said, “Printed
media like books, magazines and newspapers
are usually given very wide protection by the
courts.” The courts have let the print media be
completely open to the marketplace.

Saunders continued, “By contrast, the broad-
cast media, including the telephone, has more
limited protection of their free speech because
the electromagnetic band is a hunted public
resource.” The competition for space on that
band drives the courts to limit what the broad-
cast media can say and when.

What this basically means is that if the
Intemet is to be considered print media then it
would have more protection than if it were
considered broadcast media.

The U.S. government has already decided
what it thinks that the Internet should be with
the passing of the Communication Decency

Act On Feb. 1, President Clinton signed into
law this act. which bans the transferral of
“obscene or indecent” material to children
under the age of 18 regardless of who initiates
the transfer.

The law calls for lines of up to $250000 and ‘

up to six years in prison to anyone found
guilty of violating it. For now this law is in
limbo because the ACLU challenged the law,
and a Pennsylvania Eastern District Federal
Court suspended the enactment of it until the
trial is over.

“Who is supposed to decide what is obscene
or indecent?” asked Saunders in another ques-
tion posed to the crowd

He said that there are standards to help to
decide what is obscene but not to decide what
is indecent.

One of the standards to decide what is

Relationships in the '90s:
not 0 hopeless cause

By Mary Koch Ruiz

“I don’t know how to have a
good relationship.
Relationships scare me. Who
does have a good relationship?
How do you know when a rela-
tionship is good?” Do these
questions sound familiar?
Maybe you have heard a friend
asking them. Or,maybe you
have questioned your own
understanding of relationships.

Regardless of
what some might
believe, relation-
ships can survive
in the ‘90s. It
takes a willing-
ness to seek out
that which you
don’t know or
aren’t sure
about. Some stu-
dents state that
they didn’t have good role
models when they were grow-
ing up. That may be trueifor
many,- but that doesn’t excuse
anyone from taking the person-
al responsibility that is neces-
sary to obtain the information
and‘ seek the understanding
that’s needed to become more
insightful when it comes to
relationships.

Students can learn more
about dealing with relation-

ships at the first annual Sexual ‘

 

Assaulti Awareness Week
scheduled here on campus the
week of April 1-5. The theme
for the week will be
“Relationships in the ‘90s.” On
Tuesday, April 2, an R & R
Fest (Resources on
Relationships) will be held in
the Assembly Room of the
William Pitt Union from 11
a.m.-4 p.m. Information per-
taining to relationships will be
provided as well as free food,
- door prizes and

free T-shirts.
There will also
be movies,

music and self-
defense demon-
s t r a t i o n s
throughout the
day. Come and
join us!

On Wednesday,
April 3, a “He
Said, She Said” forum will
take place at 11:30 a.m. outside
the William Pitt Union. In
addition, a “Take Back the
Night” rally has been sched-
uled for 7 p.m. on Tuesday,
April 2.

  Veggie
/overs
get their

own day

By Sirene Leffakis
For The Pitt News

Over 30 million
Americans have explored
a meatless diet in the last
decade. Maybe you were
you one of them? ‘

Every spring the Great
American Meatout is
held in communities
across the country to
educate people about the
health, environmental
and ethical benefits of
meatless diets. It's coor-
dinated nationally by the
Farm Animal Reform
Movement, which was
formed in 1981. Today is
unofficially Meatout Day
across the country.

Individual events in
parks, malls and restau-
rants like exhibits, cook-
ing demonstrations and
food festivals take place
in all 50 states, encour-
aging Americans to
“kick the meat habit, at
least for a day.”

 

Susan Zerodowski, a
member of Animal
Advocates in Pittsburgh,
said the Meatouts in
Pittsburgh began in
1989.

“We decided to go with
Meatout to introduce the
community to vegetari-
anism, and they’ve been
so successful we’ve had
one every year since
then,” Zerodowski said.
“We try to show people
how easy meatless cook-
ing can be,” she said,
“and we want students to
come.”

Zerodowski said the
festival activities planned
for this year’s Meatout in
Pittsburgh will include a
buffet meal, vendor
tables, cooking demon-
strations and even free
massages and facials. A
local cookbook writer
will speak as well.

The Meatout this
Saturday afternoon will
be at the Calvary
Episcopal Church in
Shadyside from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Tickets cost $7
in advance and $10 at the
door. For more informa-
tion, contact Animal
Advocates in the West
End.

obscene asks the question: “Would
the average person using commu-
nity standards feel that the item in
question appeals to prurient
minds?”

Saunders asked the question:
“Which community standards are
we to use in this case?” He wanted
to know whether we should use
the standards of where the infor-
mation came from or where it is
received.

According to the courts, the
standards of where it is received
are the ones that matter.

In the court case of U.S. vs.
Thomas, the court in Tennessee

ruled that what the defendants did
was obscene and indecent.

They ran a bulletin board sys-
tem from their home in California.
A postal inspector in Tennessee
accessed this and then turned the
information over to the authorities.

They were then taken to court in
Tennessee, where they lost. After
appealing once more, the lost
again. Saunders wanted to know if
the crowd felt this was right.
Nobody did.

At this point,Saunders asked if
the crowd thought that the defen-
dants sent this information or if the
postal inspector went out and got it
himself.

Opinions
Affirmative action out

The Pennsylvania House of Representatives just found its way
into 1996. By a two-vote margin, the House passed a bill which
eliminates affirmative action in state hiring and contracting. It’s
about time.

Also in the bill is a clause which requires individuals to file
discrimination complaints in court instead of with the Human

Relations Commission (which, until now, filed complaints on

behalf of complainants).

Affirmative action served a very useful role when it was creat-
ed. Until the Civil Rights movement pushed for women’s and
minority rights, there was little if any chance for a person
belonging to a minority group to get a job outside the service
industry. Affirmative action, in its original manifestation, gave
women and minorities the chance to improve their lives.

But in the past decade, affirmative action has" exceeded its

bounds, forming a reverse type of discrimination. Anyone who 6

takes the Civil Service test gets extra points added to his or her
score for whatever minority group (women, African—American,
Asian, etc.) that person falls into. Even if you score a perfect 100
on the test, you may find yourself low on the list of potential
employees if you do not fit into one or more of the minority cate-
gories. ’

What all this means is that the best qualified people for any
type of Civil Service job may not be filling the positions. Any
time you limit the potential pool of applicants (as affirmative
action does by creating an unwritten quota system), you may not
find the person who is most qualified for the job. i

There is no doubt that racism still exists -—— it can’t be denied.
However, affirmative action in hiring practices does little but
perpetuate and exacerbate the problem. Anyone who is turned
down for a job based on race or gender has a right to be angry —
whether black or white, man or woman.

’ There is only one factor which should be weighed when con-
sidering job applicants — the qualifications to perform the speci-
fied job well. . -

The difference between 1960 and today is that education and
training are available to every group. Women and racial minori-

_.;ti_es dognotzsneedl to be given jobs just because of -their gender or
‘skin color. They have the capability to perform jobs well because
‘they can be just as qualified as any white man ever could be.

But if a minority does not have the ability to‘ perform a job, he
or she should not be hired just because of minority status.

The bill, passed by the House on Monday, now goes to the
state Senate for final approval. Hopefully the Senate will join the
House in the decision to hire based on the quality of work and
not the quantity of employees.

A quick lesson
on graduate
school life
Your editorial. against union-
izing graduate students missed

the mark since it was based on
fundamental misconceptions

- about how universities oper-

ate, the relationship of teach-
ingliassistants to the university
and the role of unions.
Teaching assistants, while
they areiionly “technically”

‘instructors, are employees of

the university. Like other
employees they receive non-
monetary benefits, such as
tuition and training, but this
does not negate their right to

isorne control over the terms

‘and conditions of their
employment.
Your assertion that

“advancement, both in respect
and financial compensation,
come with time” indicates a
serious misconception about
how universities operate in the
90s and even hints at the need
for more faculty union organi-
zation. Universities across the
nation hide behind the smoke
screen of budget cuts while
disrespecting the very degrees
they award by hiring faculty at
extremely low wages and
under conditions that preclude
any possibility of advance-
ment. Even in medicine and
education we cannot ignore
the impact of the AMA and
especially the teachers’
unions, who had to fight long
and hard to get professional
level compensation for teach-
ers. Respect and advancement
don’t just happen.

Finally, as a long-time union
member (International
Brotherhood of Electrical

Workers Local 569) Ican tell
you that the main purpose of a
union is not to strike and that
union workers will do any-
thing they can to avoid a strike
or any other work stoppage.

‘ The purpose of a union is to

democratize the workplace by
allowing for employee input,
to guarantee employee rights

; by supplying institutional and

legal frameworks for settling
grievances, and, mostof all, to
allow people to work in securi-
ty and dignity.

Further _—
misconceptions

I am writing in response to
your front-page story ‘fPitt
TAs, grad students debate
forming a union” (3/13/96). As
president of the Graduate &
Professional Student
Association, the student gov-
ernment of all 10,000 graduate
and professional students at
Pitt, I have made it my goal to
provide as much information
as possible to my constituency.
This necessarily includes
examining all options of grad-
uate student organization. For
that reason, I organized the
GPSA Thematic Forum,
“Graduate Student Life in an
Era of Restructuring.” last fall.
Out of that forum was born an
active Assembly Group of the
GPSA, the Graduate Student
Progressive Action Network.

GSPAN has subsequently
provided the university com-
munity with many events of

interest, including the visit of -

renowned historian Howard
Zinn. Furthermore, GSPAN is
working in cooperation with
GPSA in conducting the most
comprehensive survey of grad-

recently conducted an infor-

mational picket on the Yale

Undergraduate students have

a direct interest in the work

and living conditions of their j
TA’s and TFs. How so? Tl'lC_"7
more time and" training gradu-
ate student teachers are afford-
ed to prepare for classes, the

higher quality and more per-

sonalized the teaching. In fact, ‘I

it is widely known that some

of the most innovative and cut— _.

those taught by TFs. Why? In ;:,1
a tight academic job market,.
graduate students, unlike},_=
tenured faculty, are under pres— _
sure to “make a name for;-=
themselves” by being on the
pulse of their respective disci-FT"

plines. In other words. neo-
classical economic theory can
account for this phenomenon:
competitive pressures.

The March 12 debate. how-
ever, was (in my view) a
forum where Pitt graduate stu-
dents could discuss the merits
and shortcomings of the idea
of unionization. I feel it was a
gross overstatement to say. as
you did, “if the debate in the
William.Pitt Union  was any
indication, Pitt TAs and grad
students might be next in line
[to strike].” There is no union-
ization drive for graduate stu-

‘dents at Pitt at this time. If.

however, the graduate students
should decide to make such a
move, it would be my hope
that the reporting of The Pitt
News would present all sides
in an unbiased manner. saving
editorializing and prognosti-
cating for the editorial page.

return trip to the NCAA
regionals is if it wins the Big
East Conference title.for the sec-
ond consecutive year.

You know why? It’s in the
North.

Northern schools, such as Pitt,
have to deal with mother
nature’s volatile temperament
the entire spring, whereas the
southem schools have the luxury
of-playing on their ﬁelds from
the fnst day of practice.

When it snows, Pitt is inside
the Cost Center. Miami doesn’t
have to worry about snow, so it
can practice outside where ﬁeld-
ers can learn the intricate ten-

much sooner because its ﬁeld is
never covered in snow. That
leads to more games and more
experience.

The weather is also responsi-
ble for Pitt’s playing local teams
such as Duquesne. Pitt and
Duquesne play each other a total
of six times this spring. Granted,
the Dukes are a Division I pro-
gram, but the series isn't the
same as Cal-State Fullerton ver-
sus UCLA.

The Panthers are forced to
play Division II teams like
Slippery Rock and Davis &

schools get to play exclusively
Division I teams. Pitt must play .
these lesser programs because of
travel. Pitt can’t travel to, say,
Ohio State, because it would be

get there and have the games be
snowed out. _
Playing exclusively top-level

teams looks much better in the
eyes of committee ofﬁcials giv-
ing out at—large bids into the
post-season tournaments. Those

ule will no doubt play a deciding
factor in the comn1ittee’s deci-

 sion if the Panthers don’t win
* the Big East Tournament.

Take last year as an example.

Four run seventh inning gives Piff 8-7 win

By Matt Grove
S ta)?‘ Writer

The unpredictable March weather reared its
ugly head yet again yesterday at Trees Field,
but the Panthers shone in a come-from-behind
8-7 win over Crosstown rival Duquesne.

Pitt came into the game with a 12-4-1
record and a No. 23 ranking while the Dukes

 

 

brought their 2-6 mark a couple miles up
Forbes Avenue for what was to be a double-
header.

The game was originally scheduled to be
played at Duquesne, but its home ﬁeld is still
under construction. Although the game was at
Pitt’s Trees Field, the Dukes were the home
team.

The Panthers got a single and a stolen base

Pitcher Mike Rohrbach dances in the dugout after the Panthers come-from-

behind victory over Duquesne, 8-7.

Football kicks off

spring practice

from freshman Lou Melucci in the top of the
second, and he advanced to third on an error
by Duke catcher Buddy Dice. Melucci scored
Pitt’s first run on a sacrifice fly by Rob
Garvey. ,

The Dukes responded in the bottom half of
the second by putting six runs up on the
scoreboard. Panther starter John Schultz gave
up three runs on three hits and two walks
before being pulled in favor of lefthander Carl
Vollmer.

Dori McCay greeted Vollmer with an RBI

single for a 2-1 Duquesne lead. After Vollmer "

picked off Jim McCracken at second base, the
Panther defense committed two errors, which
led to another Duke run. Mike Rohrbach
replaced Volhner after the lefty hit Tony Rose
with a pitch.

Like Vollmer, Rohrbach was also greeted
with an RBI single, this time by Bryan
Cornell scoring McCay. With the score at 4-1,
Jeff Rojik came to the bat for the second time
in the inning, and, with the bases loaded, he
knocked in two more runs with a single.
Cornell advanced to second only to be picked
off by Rohrbach to end the inning.

“After the big inning, it was really down in
the dugout,” Panther‘ pitcher Jason
Rakaczewski said. “Our hitters hadn't been
hitting well enough to make us think that we
could come back from a deﬁcit like that.”

The Panthers added another run in the third
when Jason Conti scored on Joe Carter’s sac-
riﬁce ﬂy to right. But Duquesne extended its
lead to 7-2 in the bottom of the fourth as the
Panthers committed three more errors.

After Josh Mellor singled, Jason Conti
brought Pitt within three, homering oif Jamey
Keysor. Both squads failed to score in the
sixth, and they entered the seventh and ﬁnal
inning.

‘The home run really gave us a lift because
we started to drink that we could get on this
guy now,” Rakaczewski said following the
game. -

Mellor led off the seventh with a single and
Conti followed with a walk With runners on
ﬁrst and second, Kurt Womelsdorf reached

diveson his list and ﬁnished one
place behind the sixth-place ﬁnisher,
senior teammate Jeremy McClean.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Pitt football
tearn’s national championship season. And with the schedule
the Panthers have next year, they’ll be hard pressed to match
that ll-.l season, even if Hugh Green and Tony Dorsett donned
the blue and gold again.

Syracuse, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Virginia Tech and Miami.
All on the road. Head Coach Johnny Majors knows it won’t be
easy.

“It’s as difﬁcult a road schedule I’ve been involved with my
entire coaching career, without a doubt,” Majors said at a press
conference yesterday whichkicked off spring drills.

Last year, Pitt lost to all four of those Big East teams at Pitt
Stadium (Notre Dame wasn’t on the schedule) by a combined
score of 139-56, including ‘a 54-14 whipping at the hands of
Ohio State. _

And while this year’s recruiting list is highly ranked and
includes WPIAL AAAA player of the" year, QB Tony
Zimmerman, the Panthers kick off the year without the heart
and soul of last year’s offense and defense, wide receiver
Dietrich J ells and linebacker Torn Tumulty.

Along with Zimmerman, a 6-3, 205-pound product of Penn-
Trafford High School, the highly touted recruiting class
includes New Kensington’s All-State lineman Ben Kopp. At 6-
4, 275, Kopp is considered one of the best prospects to come
out of Western Pennsylvania this season. He turned down

Three Pitt divers competed in the
NCAA zone qualifiers this past
weekend. Senior Sunday
Lewandowski set a Naval Academy

pool record on the one-meter, 426.85, .

and advanced, along with junior John
Soulakis, to the NCAA ﬁnals.

Lewandowski competed in a dif-
ferent zone from her main rivals, and
she blew the competition away. The
one-meter second-place finisher
earned 391.25. Lewandowski’s
507.90 in the three-meter continued
her run. She ﬁnished 59.45 points
ahead of her closest competitor, Erica
Georges of Penn State.

9. Soulakis ﬁnished second on the
one-meter, 543, behind All-
American, Navy diver Nate Smith,
558.2.

“Jolm took care of business,” said
Head Coach Julian Krug. “He made
it clearly and easily. That's what you
do there.”

On the three-meter, Soulakis had
trouble with several of the newer

McClean’s sixth-place on the
three-meter, ﬁfth on the one- meter
andthird on platform didn’t make the
cut.

“Jeremy did a very nice job but he
had a couple of key little mistakes,”
said Krug. “One more place and he
would have had it.”

Lewandowski leaves today for the

NCAA Women’s Finals in Ann -

Arbor, Michigan She will compete
on Thursday and Friday.

Soulakis will leave a week from
today for the NCAA Men's Finals in
Houston, Texas. .

“Now he has to go and do some-
thing there,” said Krug. The plans
include scoring “in all three events
and to become full-ﬂedged All-
American.” '

To qualify as an All-American,
Soulakis must ﬁnish in the top eight
in one event. Lewandowski continues
to set her sights for Senior Nationals
in April and the Olympic Trials in
June. -

Junior running back Billy West
will surely play a leading role if
Pitt is to improve on its 2-9 sea-
son. A fractured leg and a liga-
ment sprain in his chest forced
the 5-10, 195-pounder tailback
from Smithfield, Ohio, to miss
nine games last year. '

But during his sophomore sea-
son he filled in for the injured
Curtis Martin and was named the
Big East offensive player of the
year after rushing for 1,358 yards
and six touchdowns.

- The guy who will hand the ball
off to West and his backfield
mate, sophomore Demetrius
Harris, is a question mark.

Majors said the group of ath-
letesat quarterback now is one of
the best that he’s seen at that
position. Matt Lytle and Pete
Gonzalez both started twice last
year but were inconsistent,
throwing nine interceptions and
four touchdowns.

The other two returnees at

. quarterback, Damell Dinkins and

Leon Murray, will be seeing
some time at wide receiver in
practice, and possibly in games.
\V1de receiver is a spot at which
Majors said the Panthers will
need help, especially with the
departure of Jells, the Panthers’
all-time yards and receptions
leader.

‘The team's attitude has been
superb and very encouraging
early on,” Majors said, adding
that the attitude change must last
throughout the year. “Rather than
ﬁnd a way to lose, we must find a
way to win.”

Also at the press conference
yesterday, the Pitt Athletic
Department armounced that Jack
Anderson will be directing the

basis over the summer after
