IFC Prepares Changes

Interfraternity Council took
the ﬁrst step for unanimously
endorsing a constitutional
amendment providing fo r
equal representation in Coun-
cil at the ﬁrst meeting con-
ducted by, thw newly elected offi-
cers last Wednesday.

Art Bloom, Bus. Ad. ’59, pro-
posed the amendment which re-
quires two-thirds vote of IFC at
the next meeting before ﬁnal adop-
tion.

Under the present system of
proportional representation each
fraternity is alloted two to four

representatives contingent upon
roster stren-gth.,Under the amend-

ment only two representatives will

participate in IFC one being the
president and the other an active
member, not of senior class stand-
mg,

Regular meetings will be sched-
uled every other Wednesday
rather than the present ﬁrst and
third Wednesday of each month.
This provides for a ﬁve-week
month. A

Speaking for the motion Art
Bloom stated, “This plan was for-
mulated by the nineteen presi-
dents in Council. It received much
forethought and consideration in
order to best beneﬁt all members
of IFC."

Parliamentarian Stanley Gold-
berg, Col. ’59 was re-appointed for
another term and later “elected as
delegate to the Student Govern-
ment Association. ‘ ’

Get Wilson Awards

Gordon Fleming and Margaret ‘Young Shortreed have
been awarded one—year fellowships by the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation. .

A Both winners will graduate from the University in June.

 They will receive $1,400, plus tuition for their ﬁrst year of
‘graduate work.

Fleming, a physics major at the¢

University, plans to take his year
of fellowship at the University of
Pennsylvania. He will work to-
ward his doctor’s degree in theo-
retical physics.

Mrs. Shortreed, the mother of
three children, will continue
here at the University of Pitts-
burgh. She will work toward a
master’s degree in history, her’
undergraduate major.

The fellowships enable young
scholars to try out their interests
in their ﬁrst year of graduate
work, ‘to determine if they wish to
enter college and university teach-
ing careers. -

Commenting on the Univer-
si.ty’s winners, Dr. S. Roy Heath,
chairman of the special fellow-
ship program at the University,
said “I can think of no two more
worthy candidates from. this
year’s -senior class.

“Also to be congratulated are
the faculty sponsors for theWood-
row Wilson Fellow, physics ed-
partment chairman, Dr. David
Halliday and Dr. George Fowler,
professor of history. It was their
interest and foresight that made
Gordon F1eming’s and Margaret

‘ Shortreed’s candidacy possible.”

Peake Reveals End
Of ‘Pressure’ Finals
After This Semester

Dr. Charles Peake has an-
nounced that early examinations
will be given to seniors this se-
mester. After this semester this
practice is to be discontinued.

In future years seniors will be
required to take their ﬁnal exami-
nations at the regularly scheduled
time. N

“The giving of early examina-
tions to seniors was the result of
pressures connected with Com-
mencement publications, ‘but the
practice places great burdens upon
the facultyand is, intact, edu-
cationally unsound,” commented
Peake.

Jacob of the Department of Po-

Dr. Jacob is author of the book,
“Changing Values in College." One
of his contentions was that col-
lege students are so self centered
that they have a lack of public

' and campus interest, according to
' Miss Mishelevich.

She added, however, that his
seeing the groups in session seem-

co-eds contribute well to keeping
campus spirit alive at their own
colleges and universities.

NO NEED F051

 Upon To The Public-

Therecent near criminal attack on a Pitt co-ed in En-
gineering Hall brought to light one brutal fact that students
should remember. The University buildings are public and

i like all public buildings" are easy prey for all types of street

rabble:

Several other reports have reached this office about in-
truders in the ladies’ rooms and purse snatchers in various
parts of the University.

For two years various reports have been passed on to
the paper about a- man who entered ladies rooms on sev-
eral ﬂoors of the Cathedral. Some of thesereports were
very similar in their description‘ of the intruder.

Recently a word-of-mouth warning has reached the pa.-
 per that girls should be cautioned against the seventh, tenth,

and twenty—seventh ﬂoor rest rooms in particular. The same
warning held that rest rooms on most ﬂoors above the sec-

ond should be entered with caution. 

An interesting sidelight on the intrusion of outsiders

' has been the recent reports from the Cathedral and the

Student Union of successful purse snatchings and petty
thefts. One of these accounts is printed in a letter to the

editor on this ‘page. Two of these thefts were reported in
the same week. '

9

Th important lesson to be learned from these hearsay
warnings and eyewitness testimony isthat there are rules
to follow in the reporting of crimes in’ the University.

Persons who are suspicious of strangers or unusual‘~oc_—
currences should report these to the Security Department
ongthe‘, Ground Floor of the Cathedral immediately. All
thefts or actual witnessed intrusions should also be reported

immediately, .

. Cooperation and fast action are essential to the preven-
tion of future incidents. The University Police Force and

the School Marshalls were established for the very purpose

of protecting the University from intrusion. Through the
practice bystudents and others of proper methods of re-

, porting, this protection can be vastly improved. '

 _ Political Post-Mortem . .- '2?

tion, no making charges.

11 O

(Editor’s' note: This is the ﬁrst of two articles on I

the recent student elections.) ’ .

By Murray Chass .

It was a differentgsort of campaign, that’sffor

sure. It had to be different to arouse a couple

thousand University students from a Rip Van
Winkle-sleep that permeates the air every year at
election time. — ‘

For one thing, it was a’ paradoxical campaign.
From the student interest stand-
point it was “live.” But speaking
in so-calledreal political terms,
it was dead. There was no name-
calling, no blasting the opposi-

The two parties chose to
make the usual charges private-
ly; nothing of any importance
was dragged out into the open.
Even then, the accusations that
were made were not at the oppo- W 1
sition party. Rather they were
made mutually at this paper and, more directly, at
this writer.

In fact, some members of the United Independ-
ent Party tagged this individual with the nom de
guerre, Jawaharlal. This supposedly comes from
that fellow Nehru over in the Middle East, who is
renowned for his neutrality. The name may be a
good one for Mr. Nehru, but this Jawaharlal can’t
even pronounce it. t

Then there was the serious side to the cam-
paign. Fortunately; this made up the greater part
of the six-week hulabaloo. It started out in the
usual manner: forming the parties, appointing the
top brass, setting up programs. .
, No sooner than was this done than the parties

announced some things which gave the tip-off to -—

the revitalized campaign about to unfold. Qn March
5 both. the Allied Collegiates and the United Inde-
pendents declared that their organizations would
be year-round concerns and‘ not “six-week won-
ders,” as one Collegiate so aptly put it. ‘
Ul's Draw First Blood ,

At this same.time the Independents made their
move for recognition in a big way, announcing that

,a national and state political rebel, Harold Stassen,

would appear before the Pitt student body. i

From here things movedrapidly, picking up
steam as they went. Partyplatforms were released;
slates were named; the Ulfs came up with another
gubernatorial candidate, Roy Furman, to address
the students, and the AC’s countered with Alle-
gheny County Coroner William Mcclelland.

Besides all this, the parties were busy trying to
inﬂuence their fellow students by other means, such
as letters and displays. The Independent letter, sent
to the entire voting student body, aroused ‘adverse
comment because of a couple of misstatements. _

It stated: “Since less than 20 per cent of the stu-
dent body are in fraternities, student government
has not been taken seriously by the administration”;

and, “We have slated candidates like Dick Mattern

(the only independent on Student Government this

, past year) . . .”

The ﬁrst statement seems much too doubtful
while the second is simply a misrepresentation of
fact. There were other independents on SC last
year, e.g.,”? Pat Perri, Kyra Mock, and Abbas Heydari.
Money Question Still Open

The cost of all these extras-—letters, pins,
posters, etc.-——brought about much discussion and
speculation as to where and -‘from whom the Uls
received the ﬁnancial backing. A few of the more
ridiculous guesses had it that the money came from
the University itself, the Student Union bigwigs,
and the debating organization (well, no one can be

blamed for this last guess, at least not after as

quick glance at the UI slate);

Other than the slates, which will be discussed at
a later time, the platforms are the remaining parts
of the campaign which deserve mention. At ﬁrst the
Collegiate platform. seemed to be the much stronger
of the two even though it had its drawbacks. This
was because ofthe glaring weakness of the original
UI program which included only“ three “general
tenets.” ' T

Platforms Change Shape
Later, however, four “speciﬁc goals” were added
to the UI bill, and at ﬁnal comparison showed that

t
I

i’

’ theplndependent platform was the better. A deﬁnite

weakness of the AC program was a violation of
smart political thinking. —

S In the ﬁrst section of its. two-part platform, the
party said it would not do certain things that could
interfere with administration policies. The Col-
legiates failed to realize that negative promises are
not the thing to present to the student body or any
body. Unfortunately, no one is interested in what a
party won’t do. This was a mistake.

As a ﬁnal wrap-up of the campaign itself, we
cannot say it equaled that of 1955 because neither
party came up with a “Publius,” a word and a
publication not soon to be forgotten in the annals
of Pitt election history. '

But in its own way, this past campaign has to be
considered a huge success. In fact, on the basis of
this campaign, there is every reason why the parties
should function the year-round. ‘

By Joseph Ungar

One of the most unfortunate is-
sues of current times is found in
the constantly echoing statement,
“Our country needs more and bet-
ter teachers.”

» So in view of the seriousness of
the situation it e.
is perhaps un-
just to criticize
the most widely

   

accepted. solu-
tion of the
problem. But
the proposal,
quite simply
saying, ‘‘we
in u s t r a is e
teachers’ salar-
ies,” appears, ..

 

though it may at ﬁrst sound com-
mendable, to possess an element
of dangerous misunderstanding.

Undoubtedly a publicized salary
increase might even eliminate the
shortage.

Since there are, however, two
provisions to fulﬁll, the question
is-——-would the majority of the new
people be “better” teachers, or
more bluntly, would they be
teachers at all.

Teachers Are Born. Not Made

Howéver,‘ there seems to be
something wrong with the idea
that we can create teachers by
luring intelligent individuals into
the profession with the monetary
attraction they would otherwise
seek elsewhere. For teachers, real
teachers, are somewhat like ar-

cult people to create.
What would most likely be cre-
ated in this case are instructors.

people fail to differentiate between
the instructor and the teacher.

But as mostwstudents know, the
unwritten gap between the two is
vast, and any comparison made in
light of the present challenges fac-
ing our schools shows quite clearly
that it would not be very proﬁt-
able to have an increased number
of instructors cast as teachers.

It wouldnot be very proﬁtable
because the challenges are ‘com-
plex and deal with more than lay-
ing the groundwork for faster
guided-missiles, or larger earth
satellites. I

Ironically they deal, in great
measure, with combating the pres-
sures which are being continually
built up by this pervading empha-
sis on weapons and power. Press
sures which, because of their
origin, show signs of threatening
to uproot and destroy our sense
of values. -

Stability Amid Deviations

And the loss of proper values
can be as effective a means of
destruction as ‘a hydrogen war-
head. That is why we need teach--.
ers and not instructors.

A teacher can combat ‘these
pressures simply because, regard-'
less of his chosen subject, he is a
teacher.’ While getting the facts‘
across he does something besides
talk. John Steinbeck once wrote’
a short article about three teach-
ers he remembered.: :

“My three had these things in
common—~they all loved what
they were doing. They did nottell
—they catalyzed a burning desire
to know. Under their influence the
horizons sprung wide and fear
went away and the unknown be-
came knowable. But most import-
ant of all, the truth, that danger-d
ous stuff, became beautiful and
very precious.”

Letter to. Editor-

To Whom It May Concern: ‘

On March 27 I left my office
on the 27 floor to worklin an-
other office‘ on the same floor.

‘The office was open and my boss
left at 11:45 a.m., still leaving
the office open.

At 11:55, a.m. I returned to
ﬁnd that my purse had been ran-
sacked and my wallet stolen. The
thief quickly learned there was
only 40 cents in it, but the prin-
ciple of it all is the stealing. I
would like to have the other
articles that were in the wallet
because most of them were very
personal.

person is in Education and w.a§,.

in the 11:00 a.m. Elementary-

or any class in Education, ‘he is’
not fit to become arteacher. ‘
How could that person go out
into the ‘ world and teach the
youth of America when he or she
himself has a corrupt person-
ality. It is a shame that someone
of college age endwith so much
education could let himself do
such a thing, , I , ,
I hope that the person who

SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: No. 3

Once again the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, bless their tat- .
tooed hearts, have consented to let me use this space, normally
intended for levity, to bring you a brief lesson in science.

They are generous, opcnhanded men, the m.akers of Marlboro,

- hearty, ruddy, and full of the joyof living,‘ as anyone can tell ,

who has sampled their wares. In Marlboroyou will ﬁnd no
stinting, no stinginess. M-arlboro’s pleasures are rich, manifold,
and bountiful. You get a lot to like with a Ma.rlboro—~ﬁlter,
ﬂavor, ﬂip—top box, and, in some models, power steering.

.The science that we take up today is called astronomy, from

the Greek words astsro meaning “sore” and Horny meaning 4

.“back”. Sore backs were the occupational disease of the early
Greek ast.ronon1ers, and no wonder! They used to spend every
blessed night lying on the damp ground and looking up at the
sky, and if there's a. be'tter way to get a sore back, I’d like to
hear about it. Especially in the moist Mediterrzmcan area,
where Greece is generally considered to be.

Lumbago and related disorders kept astronomy from be-
coming very popular until Galileo, an unemployed mnleteer of
Pamplona, fashioned a homemade telescope in l924 out of
three Social Security cards" and an ordinary ice cube. What
schoolboy does not know that stirring story——how Galileo
stepped up to his telescope, how he looked heavenward, how
his face filled with wonder, how he stepped back and whispered
the words heard round the world: “Let them eat cake l”

Well sir, you can imagine what happened then! William
Jennings Bryan snatched Nell Gwynne from the shadow of the
guillotine at Oslo; Chancellor Bismarck brought in four gushers
in a single afternoon; Enos Slaughter was signed by the Han-

iseatic League; Crete was declared ofi limits to Wellington's

army; and William Faulkner won the Davis Cup for his im-
mortal Penrod and Sam.

But after a while things calmeddown and astronomers began
the .'~:taggering task of naming all the heavenly bodies. ]"ii_x<t,

Then the Major Brothers of Yerkes Observatory named stars
alter their wives, Ursa and Canis, and Witnick of Harvard
named oneaftcr his wife, Big Dipper, and soon all the stai
were named. , ‘

Astronomers then turned to the question: is there life on
other planets? The answer was a ﬂat, unequivocal no. Spectro-
scopic studies proved without a doubt that. the atmosphere
on the other planets was far too harsh to permit the culture of

Michelosen Begins Spring Practice;

Largest Grid Turnout In Six Years

Lettermen Return

To Fill Line Slots
Along With Frosh

By LARRY HAGGERTY
There was no shortage of

football players when the 62-
man Blue and Gold squad re-
ported for the ﬁrst day of
spring practice at Ellsworth
Center last Wednesday. This

was one of the largest turnouts in
recent years.

Finding replacements for the
first string line will be Coach John
Michelosen’s chief task. Whether
Michelosen can find enough good
linemen to play‘ the always dif-
ficult Jungle Cat schedule remains
to be seen. ,

- Michelosen has 19 lettermen re-
turning this campaign as compar-
ed with 10 last year and there
were 28 scholarship boys on .the
1957 freshmen team of Coach
Steve Petro as compared with 18
the previous year.

Haley and Michaels Return

The Panthers are allowed twen-
ty days for practice sessions under
NCAA rules and "the annual
Spring Game will be held at the
Stadium on May 10. Co-captains
Ed Michaels and Don Crafton will
pick the teams and Michelosen
will divide his staff in two for the
game. i
Included in the group of re-

turning letterm-en are only two

players who have won two mon-
ograms. They are halfback Dick-

Haley of Midway and Michaels

of Elmira, New York.

The monogram winners include
ten seniors and nine juniors. By
positions there are four ends,
three tackles, two guards, one
center, two quarterbacks, ﬁve
halfbacks, and two fullbacks. The
1957 edition of the Panthers had

Crafton At Center -

Fullback Fred Riddle, halfback
Joe Scisly, and tackles Ken Mont-
tanari and Bill Lindner are listed-
as juniors on the roster although
they are actually seniors. How-
ever, all four players have two
years of eligibility remaining.

The returning lettermen are
Ends Art Gob, Joe Pullekines,
Jim Zanos, and Bob Rathi. Lind-
/ner, Montanari, and Ernie West-
wood are the tackles. Returning
guards are Michaels and John
Guzik with Crafton the only
center coming back.

Bill Kaliden and Ivan Toncic

callers while Riddle and Bob

Dick Scherer and Gordon Oliver,
Jim McCusker and Ron. Kissel,
tackles, guards Dan Wisniewski,
Ed Humeston, and Dick Carr, and

gone. ‘

Carr had one year of eligi-
bility left, but decided not to re-
turn.,Scherer lead the Panthers
in two vital department’; last
year, pass receiving; and scoring.
He caught the winning touch-
down pass against Penn State.

This year’s schedule includes

the usual tough teams with Michi-
gan State, Minnesota, UCLA, and
Holy Cross replacing previous foes
Oregon, Oklahoma, M i a mi of
Florida, and Southern California.

The “Split-T” will be used
again and like all Michelosen
teams, will probably be we1l-con-
ditioned and hard driving. “This
season’s squad shows a lot of
hustle and team spirit,” stated
Michelosen after the ﬁrst practice
last week.

Home games this season are
with Holy Cross, West Virginia,
Army, Notre - Dam_e, and Penn
State.‘ Opponents met on foreign
soil will be UCLA, Minnesota,
Michigan State, Syracuse, and

Win Opener, 4-3 

By JIM LACEY

The Panther baseball team started the season with a 4-3 A

victory as they edged by Indiana State Teachers College at
Wildwood Country Club last Wednesday. The winning run
wasscored with two outs in the last of the ninth, as Pete
Colangelo scored from second on Ken Malley’s single to

center,

Bill Hamilton, starting pitcher,
"allowed the Indians just three
hits. Hamilton was relieved by
John Reichenbach in the eighth,
who blanked the Teachers the

 est of the way to get dredit for
"he victory.

The Indiana pitchers, John Bar-
ley and Ken Parsha, were almost

as stingy. as they allowed the’

Both coaches were amazed at
the faultless play on the part of
both teams. Coach Bobby Lewis
exclaimed, “This was the best
first game I’ve seen. The boys
on both teams were in mid-
season foriiri. This is amazing
considering the little’ amount of
game practice we have had.’

The Indians opened the scoring
in the ﬁrst inning, John Marifko
walked and moved around on a
ground-out and an error by Mike
Tuchak.

Hoover Sacriﬁces

The Jungle Cats tied the count
in the third DeLost and ‘Hamilton
opened the inning with successive
singles. They held as George
Schoeppner ﬂied deep to John
Bizyak, who made a circus catch
of the drive. Passes to Kartsonas
and Jim Dunlap forced in a run.

The Panther’s forged into the.
lead in the sixth on a walk to
Malley, who advanced on a sac-
riﬁce and a wild pitch. He then
scored on a sacriﬁce ﬂy by Ron
Hoover.

Three singles in the seventh
sandwiched around a walk count-
ed two runs for the Indians. Al
Hofman walked, then Bizyak,
Parsha, and Don Anderson banged
bingles.

Colangclo Scores

The Blue and Gold lost little
time in tieing the count as they
bagged a run in the seventh. De-
Lost singled, his second hit, and
came around to score as Schoep-
pner, and Malley walked and
Dunalp was hit by a pitch.

That was the scoring until

‘Colangelo scored the winning
run in the ninth on ‘Malley’s
single to center. Colangelo re-
ceived a walk, and moved up on
a sacriﬁce by Schoeppner, then
scored on the winning hit.,

This week the Panthers start on
a road trip that will ﬁnd them
playing ten of eleven games away
from the friendly conﬁnes of
Wildwood.

over to the President after the
Carnival. ‘

oldest relay carnival started out
as a one-day affair and in 1915 it
had to be expanded to two days.
Over 3,100 athletes are listed for
action at this year’s meet. “I plan
to enter nearly a full team in the
Carnival,” stated Panther Coach
