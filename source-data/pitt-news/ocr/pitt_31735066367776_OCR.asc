Off -CampusDorm Rules

Issued By Dean Of  Men

‘ The Office of the Dean of Men has released a statement
incorporating the principal “convictions the University holds
concerning men’s off—campus housing.

After expressing the University’s thanks to local house-
holders who attempt toprovide quality accommodations for
students, the statement recognizes the twin needs of:

(7) Assisting students to obtain suitable oﬁ-campus

housing and

(2) Offering support and aid to householders who, by

offering rooms meeting the Uni-¢

versity’s standards for approval,
help to meet increasing demands
for off-campus facilities.

Believing that a householder
and a student who agrees to live
on his premises have “mutual
and overlapping responsibili-
bies.” The ofﬁce lists these rules.

1. Review the conditions with

the householder periodically; be

familiar with the ﬁnancial ar-.
rangements and never commit the
“cardinal sin” of A the student
roomer—falling behind schedule
in rent payments.

2. Be particularly observant of
the needs of those around you to
study, sleep or go about their nor-
mal routines without interrup-
tion.

3. Make restiution if damage is

caused to any furnishings and

equipment you use daily, whether
it is caused through carelessness or
malicious intent.

4. Observe the following pro-
hibitions in the approved rooms:
No possession and use of alco-
holic beverages by minors; No
gambling; No ﬁre arms and ﬁre
works; No entertainment of
women guests of college age.

The University feels “that a
mediating role is necessary for the

V , University if misunderstandings or
‘ difﬁculties develop between house-

 V holders and students.” A

Senior Receives
Science Award
From Watch Firm

Mrs. Geraldine Sowinski Pin-
kus, graduating. natural sciences
senior, received the Hamilton

Watch Award in the Croghan-‘

Schenley Room from Dr. Albert
Martin, dean of Liberal Arts last
Friday.

The award, a Hamilton watch
and Certiﬁcate of Achievement
was presented for the ﬁrst time at
the University to the outstanding
senior in the Natural Sciences
who also shows outstanding
achievement in either extracurric-
ular activities or the humanities.

The awards being given as an
incentive to students to estab-
lish interests outside of their
major ﬁelds. The Hamilton
Watch Company believes that
besides being proﬁcient in his
major ﬁeld a person should also
have “the capacity of seeing
things as a whole instead of
narrowly in terms of an individ-
ual part.”

Mrs. Pinkus, receiving the
award on her 22nd _ birthday,
plans to enter the University
School of Medicine. She has pub-
lished papers pertaining to her
major, Chemistry,

John P. Gillin, dean of the Di-
vision of the Social Sciences, an-
nounced the appointment of Pro-
fessor James D. Thompson as Act-
ing Chairman of the Department
of Sociology for 1961-62.

Professsr Thompson has been
director of the Administrative
Science Center since 1957 when
he came to the University. He will
also continue in this post.

Thompson was born in Indian-
apolis, Indiana. He received his
bachelors and masters degrees
from the University of Indiana,
and his Ph.D. from the University
of North Carolina.

As Acting Chairman, Professor
Thompson will work with faculty

New Dress
Regulations

The Association of Women Stu-
dents Executive Board has drawn
up recommendations concerning

the dress for women residents
during the Spring Trimester bas-
ed on the suggestion made by the
Women’s Dormitory Board.

The ‘new ‘ dress regulations rec-
ommend that women continue to
wear dresses in the Cathedral and
all campus buildings other than
dormitories. This recommenda-
tion will also apply to the sched-
uled social functions and pro-
grams such as the Midday Series.

Bermudas with blouses are
acceptable in the cafeteria for
breakfast and lunch, but for
dinner AWS encourages the
women to appear in skirts. The
Executive Board has said “We
realize that it may be uncom-
‘ifortable or inconvenient to
comply with this recommenda-
tion. At such time bermudas
with blouses will be accept-
able.”

Mary Lou Karges, president of
AWS, stated: “The Pitt student
body does have a reputation for
being well-dressed.

AWS took the initiative to dis-
cuss this matter and suggest the
change for this term since the
Student Affairs Committee, Where
the dress code originated, has not
been meeting for the Spring Tri-

Apmester.

Jazz To Highlight Dance

Eddie Harris, a nationally
known jazz artist, will highlight

Mediating Meddlers

The »University’s interest in the conduct of the- off-
campus student createsa ‘strong image of the parent who
doesn’t think it’s time for his twenty—year old darling to
take care of himself. ‘ ‘

The recent mediating policy adopted by the University.

concerning Oakland householders and students not only is
an insult to the individual student, but in addition is com-
pletely irrelevant to the function of a university. A univer-
sity can educate a person but it cannot indoctrinate at stu-
dent with its own moralistic beliefs especially when most

I students already have their own.

Although students often live off-campus for economi-
cal reasons, this is usually an ulterior motive. A student
who wants to be responsible for himself prefers to discipline
himself. If he likes to play penny ante, drink beer or “en-
tertain women guests,” the Univer.sity cannot possibly pro-
hibit his actions when he is living off-campus.

Also, the rather intelligent student that the University
is trying to attract would mostilikely overlook Pitt if he
thought the University was going to regulate his private life.

And of course, one can immediately ask how can the

'University regulate the actions of students in their leisure

moments when students in their own dormitories drink
and gamble. Although it is a fact that these activities are
not permitted in the dormitories, it is also a fact that this
fact is violated “quite” frequently. The University just
cannot afford‘ a parental bodyguard forieverystudent liv-
ing in the dormitories even-if it sincerely tries to limit these
traditional collegiate endeavors.

In addition, students procuring rooms in the Oakland
area, whether approved; or not approved, usually obtain
these rooms only by agreeing to certain rules and regula-
tions. Most householders, before accepting a student £3 a
tenant, assert emphatically that “wild parties” are not
permitted.

In the ruling to the student living in off—campus hous-

ing, the statement “the householder may have other rules"

which he wishes to specify” was written, but in the preced-
ing section the following statement appeared:

“In the interest of all concerned, it is felt that there
must be certain prohibitions; the possession and use of
alcoholic beverages by minors is strictly prohibited in ap-
proved rooms; gambling is not permitted; ﬁre arms and ﬁre-
works are not permitted; the entertainment of women

‘guests’ ofcollege age is prohibited.” The general response

to the last statement is “Are women of high school age
approved?”

When reactions to such policies are along this line, one
wonders if‘ the University has not begun to think of itself
as a whole unitrather than a unit made up of individual
parts -- each part of which has certain rights. The moral

. philosophy of a few administrators, although noteworthy,

cannotibe applied to the whole. If this policy was meant
to be only a suggestion, then it should have been stated

.that itiwas a suggestion rather than oscillating between

. .strong_,yet;subtle threats and vaguelpacifying statements.

 

Tantalizing Aroma Rises from 12th Floor...

Cheaper bythe Dozen 

By Susanna Downie‘

As I was standing in a Cathedral elevator the
other day, I overheard a professional tweed four
inches from my nose musing aloud about what is
accomplished by all the activity on the twelfth
ﬂoor. His companion, a trench coat with briefcase,
conjectured that perhaps all the scurrying to and
fro is devoted to the proper func-
tioning and maintenance of a
great odorizing machine which
produces tantalizing aromas for
the sole purpose of tormenting
the hapless inhabitants of the _,
13th ﬂoor who must ﬁdget and ’
pace and try to ignore the moist
scent of warm devil’s food cake
while waiting for insidious ele-
vators.

The trench coat got off be-
fore he could develop his thesis
further, but I continued to ponder the question and
ﬁnally came to the conclusion that outside of the
maddening aromas of oven-fresh pastries, which
are never seen or eaten, the only other evidence of
creative activity to emanatefrom the secret corners
of the Twelfth Floor is-«a plethora of rules, a can-
cerous cloud of legislation, covering everything
from jumping out of dormitory windows (this is
forbidden after 10:30 on weekdays) to keeping pet
alligators in the kitchen sink (this is forbidden 24
hours a day). ’

Cub Vandalism _
True, some of these rules are quite reasonable,

__ seeking primarily to curb various sorts of vandal-
ism, such as using scotch tape on the walls or

smashing one’s desk with an ax. But the rest of
them, gentle reader, constitute the Scandal of the
Age, which I am about to reveal to you———i.e_. the
Great Protection Racket. This is the unscrupulous
practice, unwittingly endorsed by parents and

aﬁects only women. And so it does, but only super, ,1

it is an, attitude, the reforming attitude of the mis-
sionary. I shall only add that when all hands are

Society’s Menace L) i
To return to the subject: These rules are vei(y s
cleverly worked out so that they may be broken s
easily and quickly, thus necessiatating more rules
and the added protection of penalties, which in
turn mean even more rules 1 . . and so it goes, a {
perpetuating menace to society, which society con-
dones. V
I do not cavil at such venerable codes as the
Ten Commandments, the U. S. Constitution, or the J

Boy Scout Laws. These remain sutﬁciently general
to allow the exercise of Individual Initiative. But *

I think it not only superﬂuous but dangerous that,-
students, innocent though they may be, should be i
told what to wear where, when to come and go,
how to live, and what not to be caught with in 1
their rooms ever (e.g. beer, sex, and water-pistols).-
Very few people learn about things like that until
they’ve been allowed to make their own mistakes.
And anyway,.the 12th or any other ﬂoor, working
night and day for all three trimesters couldn’t turn»;
out enough rules to keep fraternities from fraterniz.
ing (beer), sororities et al. from fraternizing (sex),
or the U. S. Army from stacking up nuclear weap-
ons (especially in its off-campus residence). '

With Carbon Papers

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a student I have read of
complaints in your’ paper con-
cerning the University police. I
dismissed these as typical stu-
dents complaining because‘ they
were trying to rationalize their
own "actions. Now I think dif-
ferently. . I

On Memorial Day, I saw a
University policeman checking

«parked cars on the lot next tor

the stadium. The lot was only
half ﬁlled with cars and the of-
ﬁcer was. giving outotickets to
about half of these for not hav-
ing permits. I know for a fact

that some of these cars belong“

to persons -who had voluntarily
given up their holiday in order
to work in Scaife Hall. Some of
these persons parked in the lot
because they assumed that on
a, national holiday the prohibi-
tions against , parking are re-
moved as they are in the city on
Sundays and holidays. I suspect
one car belonged to a visitor to
the University. ,But it made no
difference, they all got tickets
even though there was plenty of
unused space available for park-
ing permit holders. I can see
policemen ticketing on a work
day to parking violators but not
on a legal holiday. Just where
are honest workers and out of
town visitors going to park on
a holiday-—especially when there
is a ball game at Forbes Field?
I was hoping, as I watched
this oﬁicer swagger around the
lot, that a city police officer
would come by and catch the
University policeman littering
the streets with the thrown away
carbons from the ticket book. It
would be a low down act to ar-
rest another officer even if he
littering streets. But it
would be no lower than giving
out tickets on a legal holiday.
No, I didn’t get a ticket.
Medical Observer

“absence makes the heart grow fonder,” the incumbent

A members of Student Government should not.

Since their president, Richard Sobota, stepped into
oﬂice on February 22, he has attended “few” senatorial
meetings -— none during the last two months. I During his

I election campaign, however, Sobota said, “In order for SG

to function properly, no one branch should be bogged down;
with the matters of another.” Thisis exactly what he has
done to the.Sena'te. He conducted only one executive meet- ,

ing and never officially established an executive body for A
the group of which he is the head.
Yet, within the next few weeks, a new advisor will be '

chosen for SG. It is extremely important ‘that this advisor

A be an inﬂuential personin the student affairs area.

Many of theweaknesses of SC}, not only now but also
in the past, result from an oversight by -administratorsiiriy.
general, concerning the amount of responsibility a student
can assume and the degree to which he canaparticipate in
establishing University policies. SG needs an advisor will-
ing to help them in gaining recognition. ‘ i e

A P1“0gF€SSi_‘_/e university" needs these progressive stu- -
dent leaders. Sobota, as a student leader, does not reﬂect __
the attitude that most students have toward the role they
should be playing at a university. He is the atypical. that
can bereferred to by others, not informed, as the typical.
His neglect of office has deterred S4G’s emergence from its I,
cocoon of weakness. It would be wise for SG to usurP'
Sobota’s oiﬁcial title rather than continue to search for “an
absentee voter.” This would be one way to show “the
right administrator” that SG is ready for new responsibili-
ties by accepting its present one of being a legislative body.
e In addition, SG might be able to achieve the ends that
Sobota so hypocritically proclaime in his campaign
speeches last winter. . __

Prober of Frog Pond
F lounders in Analysis

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

The psychoanalyst’s office, like the courtroom, has proven
to be an exciting source of best-seller material in. recent
‘ years. The immediate problem of the psychological novelist
is, however to weigh his excitement by deciding what should

be true and what should be ﬁction in the story.

As a Freudian-ﬁctioneer,

the -woman who used the

pseudonym Joyce Maclver has¢

obviously had much diﬂiculty with
her measuring in THE FROG
POND (George Braziller, Inc.; 412
pp.; $4.95).
This autobiography, a story of a
career girl’s extended residence
on the cuckoo couches of six (count
‘em) different psychiatrists has
all the elements of a moving story,
"but most of them are unfortun-
ately lost in the shuffle between
emotive reporting and Hollywood-
like contrivance.

Joyce Maclver shares a large '
New York apartment with two
other neurotics, Toni and
Daphne, who are described as
being “composite pictures made
from the elemental parts of
many real people.” They appear
to the reader as being exactly

‘that.

Toni is a semi-show business
career girl who changes analysis"
as often as she changes her hem-
Iine: strictly to be in fashion. Her-
.big chance to become mentally,
healthy is crushed early in the
book when she is disappointingly
carried off to Central Park for a
dry-run honeymoon.
She had planned on the_Catski1ls.
Daphne is a beautiful and fash-
ionable chick who sparks a mu-
tual animosity with her two com-
‘Danions; but she continues to live
with them for quite some time.
As a faddist, she keeps her
g1oom—mates constantly on their
toes. If she decides to become an
urban nudist, for example, then it
IS the duty of Joyce and Toni to
man the window blinds all day.
Still it is Joyce Maclver, our
Rorschach-raconteur, who is the
’ most disturbing character of all.
Throughout the story, she is

, continually running a, mental

«fever or two. She is searching
for a man who will murder her.
She is searching for Life’s Great
Fulﬁllment. She is searching
£01 an understanding of the

Devilman” who occasionally
resides in her body and manip_
ulates her will. She is searching
for the meaning of reality.

It appears that the author was

too busy searching to take time

.13-lit to explain the objects of her

: searches to the reader. This lack

V 4 f explanation probably occurred

as‘a result of the jagged boundar-
iesof fact and fanciﬁcation in the
novel. Indeed, the heroine tells
one analyst: “I can write other
people’s stuff but not my own.”
Fictionalizing fact is difficult, but
it is no excuse for erasing fact.
The. better parts of, the book,
however, are concerned with the
psychiatrists, and not the psychos.
As the author and her girl friends
talk through their years of couch
confession, the reader really sees
how important a _ good analyst
can be to a mentally sick person.
But we see bad analysts, too.

For the problems are complicat-
ed with a string of sick psychia-
trists, believe it or -not. Although
they colorfully range from maso-
chists to Marxists, the confusion
from their intrusion leaves only
this conclusion:-'

National Service Foundations

Training Grants Total $22,000

By PAUL WILSON

The National Service Founda-
tion has made two grants totaling
$22,000 to the Addison H. Gibson
Laboratory of the School of Medi-
cine’s Summer Science Training
Program for secondary school
teachers and students.

This project, now entering its
third year, is under the direction
of Dr. John R. Jablonski and Mr.
Joseph H. Sunder, both research
assistants of the Addison H. Gib-
son Laboratory in Scaife Hall.

The purpose of the program,
according to Dr. Jablonski, is to
stimulate the “students’ synthetic
thinking mechanism. Vie try to
get away from the cook—book type
of biology and chemistry by doing
original research work in very
simple problems which have con-
tinuing aspects.”

The project began in 1959 when
a few students from North Hills
High School came to the Gibson
Laboratory for help with a bio-
logical problem. This led to set-
ting up a summer program at
North Hills supported by the Lab

and the North Hills School Board.

The next summer, the National
Science Foundation awarded a
grant which allowed the program
to expand, enough to accomodate
38 students representing seven
other area high schools. This sum-
mer, 64 students will participate.

The participants are selected
not on their grades but on their
motivation to do such wor .‘
Applicants were given a re-
search problem for which there
was no solution. Those who
showed the best ability to rea-
son and to think experimentally
in posting ways to solve this
problem were chosen to work
in the program.

The ﬁrst summer’s work was
largely in the area of cancer re-
search but the project now has
branched into tissue culture, his-
tology, breeding, genetics and bi-
ostatistics. Later plans include
work in nutrition and various bio-
physical problems such as the sep-
aration, isolation and identiﬁca-
tion of constituents of body ﬂuids
and cellular components.

C. Eikelberger
Discusses New
United Nations

By BARRY GROSS
Director of the American Associa-
tion of United Nations, spoke
Thursday in Stephen Foster Me-
morial on “The United States in
the New United Nations.” The oc-
casion of his speech was the 1st
Annual Alumni Forum.

“Every issue of‘ our foreign pol-
icy ﬂows through the UN inone
form or another,” Dr. Elkelberger
said.’ T'hen he gave “three ways in
which the UN can be considered
new.

He considered the UN new con-
stitutionally. Originally straight-
jacketed because the great powers
have generally proven themselves
unworthy of their positions, the
UN has increased its efﬁciency by
shifting its emphasis from the
Security Council to the General
Assembly.

“You might say,” continued the
doctor, “that the UN is in the
shadowy area between a league
of states and a world govern-
ment.”

The UN is also new inthe fact
that the scientiﬁc revolution has
brought about the creation of new
agencies. Eikelbergerer said that
the ﬁrst decade of the UN was the
Atomic Age and that this, the sec-
ond decade, is also the Space Age.

Eorty percent of the present
UN membership is new states.
“You may contemplate in the near
future 15 new states,” he said,
calling this the result 10f quick
overﬂow of thecolonial world.

. Dr. Eikelberger concluded by
asserting that “The US has no
choice but to go on from our half-
way policy and play a stronger
and stronger role in the UN.

Then Albert Martin, dean of
Liberal Arts at the University, a
professor of Political Science and
an authority on international af-
fairs, spoke, giving his reactions
to Eikelberger’s talk.

Dean Martin said that the prime
question is that of the UN’s func-
tion, which could lie anywhere
between a debating society and a
world government.

He was followed by Dr. Chee-
ver of Harvard, an Assistant Pro-
fessor of International Affairs and
Professor of Political Science, who
is joining the University in Sep-
tember.

9 The large crowd which turned

out for the commencement could
not be seated in the Mosque, and
the friends of many graduates
were directed instead to the S01»-
diers and Sailors Memorial to
await the program’s ending.

The Reverend Eugene Carson
Blake, principal speaker at“ the
commencement exercises, urged
the graduates to “live for values
that go beyond one’s own com-
fort and security.”

Dr. Blake, Stated Clerk of the

United Presbyterian Church, also
‘said, “I had rather be a student
riding in a freedom bus in Missis-
sippi than one looking for a safe
job in a large corporation. I had
rather build a bridge, write a
poem, paint a picture, or even
make a speech, than to use my

.life ‘getting and spending’ . . .

laying waste my years.”

Previous to Reverend Blake’s
address he and four other noted
Americans were awarded honrary
degrees. The four were Max Ab-
ramovitz, David Dodds Henry,
Thomas Parran, and Elvis J.
Stahr. ‘

Chancellor Litchﬁeld conferred
over 1300 degrees to the graduat-
ing students. From this number
211 undergraduates and graduates
received honors. 26 graduated
summa cum laude, having achiev-
ed a 3.75 quality point average;
63 were awarded a magna cum
laude distinction, indicating a 3.50
QPA; and 122 received their de-
grees cum laude, with a 3.25 ave-
rage. .

Among those receiving their de-
gree summa cum laude from the
School of Liberal Arts were: Ann
Abbinanti, Helen Barnes Craig,
Barbara Reif Griffin, and James
Joseph Gallagher, all Bachelors of
Arts.

Those Bachelors of Science

from the School of Liberal Arts
who were awarded their degrees
summa cum laude were: Gail Ann
Bruder, Monte Stuart Buchsbaum,
Betty Gertrude Idzkowsky, Irvin
Herbert Jacobs, Barbara Ann
Katz, John Charles LaRosa, Jer-
ald Frank Lowry, William Ed-
ward Peoples, Geraldine Franca
Sowinski, Sybil Camens, Michael
Altman, and Morris Stampfer.
“ Charles Joseph Merlo, Lucian
Alexander Spriggs, Jr., Jack Reed
Daily, James Alfred Cook, Jr.,
and Marshall King Kurtzman
graduated summa cum laude from
the School of Engineering.

Richard‘ Joseph Maley received
a summa cum laude Bachelor of
Arts degree and Lois Gloria Dia-
mond and Madeline Helkes Apt
were awarded summacum laude
Bachelor of Science degrees.

These three were all from the
School of Education.

Straight From

By JACK SMITH

Executive Sports Editor

DID YOU KNOW THAT?

THAT —— Forty-four Pitt athletes, current and past, re-
ceived degrees at Pitt’s Commencement exercises Saturday.
Included in this group were three l.ettermen who graduated
with honors. They were Dan Kanell, record holder in the
shot put, from Liberal Arts; Cal Smith, most valuable player
in soccer and Athletic Committee Award winner, from Engi-
neering; and Carl Templin, soccer, from Education.

THAT —- There are no women sports activities this
summer. Considering the number of on-campus women stu-
dents, it’s a gross neglect that there isn’t planned recreation
for the fairer sex.

THAT -—- There will be more than 2,000 students living
on campus next fall. If the Athletic Department is planning
on the students using their new athletic facilities, when
they are ﬁnished, they had better ﬁnd some means of trans-
porting Pitt students up “Sampson” hill.

THAT — WIIC-TV may not carry the video tapes of
the Pitt football games this year. The local station claims
that the taped shows last year proved far too expensive.

THAT — Two Pitt football players who had below-par
years in 1960 hope this isn’t the case in 1961. Larry Vignali,
the Panther’s ﬁreplug. guard, and Bob Clemens, ﬁrst-string
halfback, want to forget the ’60 season. “I was overweight
and I will be the first to admit it,” Clemens said. “I lost that
extra step and it made all the difference in the world, I am
coming to camp at 198. Last year, I weighed 210. I thought
I could keep my speed and at the same time put on some
weight. I learned the hardlway. It won’t happen again.”

Actually Clemens’ performance last season wasn’t that
bad. He gained 349 yards, more than anyone else on the
team, caught seven passes for 75 yardsand scored three
touchdowns.

Vignali was hurt in the UCLA game which was the ﬁrst

of the season. A shoulder injury caused Vignali to miss two

' other games. “It was just one of those years,” he said. “Ac—

tually I was lucky my injury didn’t put me out for the
season.”

THAT — Six basketball doubleheaders will be
played at the Field House during the 1960-61 season. The
first twin-bill willrbe on January 3 when Carnegie Tech
meets Harvard and Pitt tangles with Kent State.

THAT — Coed Joan Edwards is planning on attending
football camp. Pitt football coaches ‘aren’t too optimistic
about the 1961 season. They say the team is young and will
make its share of mistakes.

 THAT —— Pitt’s track team should be stronger next year’
with the additionrof this year’s outstanding freshmen. Re-

member the name Joe Friend. He could develop into the
University’s greatest hurdler before he is graduated.

Panthers Win
lst Game, Lose

Second in 14th

Kicked. Ball in Last

Inning Kills Cats
What was supposed to be
a short twilight doubleheader
at Fort Lee Saturday night,
almost turned into an all

night aﬁair. The Panthers
won the ﬁrst game, 6-5 but
lost a heartbreaking second con-
test 2-1. H

The Panthers started the ﬁrst
game at 6:30, expecting to ﬁnish
both games early. But the second
game went 14 innings and lasted
until 1:15 a.m. before Ft. Lee won
it.

Bill Shay started the ﬁrst game
for the mitters and as is character-
istic of Panther hurlers this year,

‘gave up three quick runs in the

first inning. Ralph Shutterly
bailed-him out of ‘trouble and went
on to pick up the win in the ﬁrst
game.
‘ Supsura Connects

Fort Lee led until the sixth in-

ning when Mike Supsura caught a

left-center that was good for a
double and two runs. ‘The Pan-
thers went on to pick up four
runs in the sixth, enough for a
win.

But the second game was a
different story. The Panthers
had intended playing a seven
inning second game also, but
with the game tied 1-1 after
nine innings there was nothing
left to do but play. And at 1
a.m. they were still playing.

It wasn’t until the 14th inning
that Ft. Lee ﬁnally won the game.
With a man on third and two out,

to the shortstap. On the throw,
ﬁrst baseman John Ciofﬁ dropped
the ball. The runner gave the
ball a kick and the run scored.
Runner Kicks Ball

The Panthers protested th e
kicking of the ball but it was for
naught, for the Ft. Lee players

the run crossed the plate.

The loss was even more heart-
breaking for Panther pitcher
Jim Sylvis who hurled the en-
tire 14 innings.

“I don’t know if it was the late

hours or what,” said Bill Summers

Finish Season at 11-2

Six Panthers won their singles
matches and combined for two of
three doubles wins to easily defeat
-- ~ Fort Lee in a tennis exhibition at

 Ft. Lee Saturday.
From the opening match in

which Joe Brown beat John Zike,
A 6-1, 6-4, it was apparent that the
University ‘raquetmen were going
to have little trouble with their
hosts.

The only match the Cat's lost
was in doubles play when Roger
Gaser and Pete Nycum fell to
Dick Bjorklind and Greg Marshall,
6-1, 6-1.

Although the encounter was
only an exhibition affair, it will
count on the Panther’s win-loss
ledger which now stands at 11-3.

“It was just that they lacked in
depth,” Coach Bill Summers said
after the match. Most of the teams

we played this year gave us more
competition. But the experience
of playing was good for both
teams..
Jack Douglass, who beat out
Dave 0’Loughlin in an inter-

squad match last week, played
as the Panther’s second man.

Douglass, recently selected by
his teammates as the squad’s
most valuable player, upended
Ft. Lee’s Jeff Green 6-0, 6-0.

Douglass, who won in singles
with accurate placements, com-
bined with Brown to beat Zike
and Green in doubles competition,
6-0, 6-3.

In other action Ralph Mason
beat Bjorklind, 6-1, 7-5; Paul
Kochman dumped Marion Wool-

ridge, 6-0, 6-3 and Gaser beat

The Psychology Department is looking more like the un-

In two games this season Psychology is yet to be beaten. But
in both games they had to come up with a big last inning to

win 10-7, 18-7.

give up something to participate in
the game. . Coach Bobby Lewis

ters degree at the Commencement
exercises Saturday, team manager
Pat Burne was to graduate.

Four Athletes Get
MVP Award For
Efforts in Sports

Four athletes were honored last
week at a luncheon for being the
outstanding athletes in Panther
spring sports.

Dan Kanellp received the most
valuable player award in track.
Kanell was also awarded the East-
ern Collegiate Athletic Conference
award for scholastic and athletic
excellence. He maintained an ex-
cellent point average in pre-med
and at the same time was the lead-
ing scorer on the track team with
66 points.

A senior and co-captain this
year, Kanell holds the school rec-
ord for the shot put.

Other MVP awards went to J et-
ry Matulevic, third baseman on’
the baseball team, Jack Douglass,
tennis, and golfer Ron Dermitt,
who was runner-up in the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
Golf Tournament this year.

got on the winning track by
dumping Lambda Chi 8-2, then
Lambda Chi came back to knock
off the highly touted Chemical En-
gineers 12-5.

Schenley picked up their first
off the four-hit pitching of Jack
Smith. Two of Lambda Chi’s
hits were to the inﬁeld.

Schenley backed up Smith with
a 13-hit attack. iKen Stabisky had
a perfect day at the plate’ going

chipped in with two doubles. "Ben
Jinx had two hits also.

On the basis of their ﬁrst win
the Chem-E's were ranked tops
in IM play, but Lambda cut them
down to size by a 12-5 count. Most
of the Chem-E's trouble came as
a result of 10 errors. Their usually
strong hitting wasn’t up to par
either.

Esper Deep hit the only long.

ball for the Engineers but that
one was caught by Jack Bayard in

Writers Claim Cool:
Makes All -Americans

By JACK

Pittsburgh sports writers who gather to hash over the
events of the week every Tuesday at Frankie Gustine’s on
Forbes Avenue, claim that behind every potential All—Ameri—
can is an athletic publicity man using his pointed pen to
push his candidate toward national recognition.

Perhaps the man most often cited by this group for his

 

SMITH

ability to bring an athlete before?-
the public eye is the University of
Pittsburgh’s Beano Cook. Dan
Parker, sports editor of the New
York Daily Mirror once said that,
Cook is “the greatest publicity
man since Barnum, and on sec-
ond thought, Bailey too.”

One thing is certain, few men.
have worked as an athletic pub-
licity man for ﬁve years and have
had ﬁve athletes gain All—Ameri-
can rating.

Poor Carroll

Beano~ became Pitt’s- athletic
publicist in July, 1956, after com-
pleting 21 months and six days
of Army service. Before entering
the Army, Cook spent one year at
Brown University. After the serv-
ice Cook attend the Pitt.

By many people Beano Cook
is considered eccentric. And by
the two sports writers who, one
afternoon last fall, found him
sleeping or top of his ﬁling
cabinet, he will always be re-
membered as something of an
oddity.

A Pittsburgh sports writer
testified to this. When traveling
through an Eastern city he said
he stopped at the local paper and
asked if Mr; Cook had been here.
“I don't know if his last name
is Cook, but if you mean that
crazy Beano from Pitt, he was
here. That guy is nuts but we
will print his material any time.”

Here in ’56

According to Cook the ﬁrst
name Carroll had several other
drawbacks as a youth. “I used to
get all kinds of advertising circu-
lars for bras, slips, and under-
clothing. It was almost embar-
rassing.” Cook is not married, but,
like a submarine with its peri-_
scope up, he is constantly seeking
a target.

The greatest advantage Cook
A claims to have had when he be-
came Pitt’s athletic -publicity
director was the nickname
“Beano.” “If I used the name
Carroll, which is my first name,
no one would remember me.
But with the name Beano, I
can’t be forgotten.”

When you are near the Pitt
Field House, drop in at Beano’s
office. You will ﬁnd the 29-year
old dynamo with his legs prop-
ped on his desk, and tie pushed
almost meticulously to one side.

Calls Spade a Spade

“No one will ever accuse Beano
of supporting any other school
than Pitt,” says Chester Smith,
sports editor of the Pittsburgh
Press. As A. L. Hardman, sports
editor of the Charleston, W. Va.
Gazette, put it, “Cook has one
distinction that in our book sets
him aside and perhaps above
most of the others. And that is
that he’ll call a spade a spade. If

his beloved Pitts are bad, and if

will say so.

critical newspapermen, c r o s s
country, freshmen, professional
baseball, complimentary tickets

and losing teams.
Completely Loyal
Beano is tall and a little on the
fat side, especially around the
neck and the middle.

As a publicist, Cook recog-
nizes the value of getting an
athlete a pre-season rating as
a possible All-American. “Once
an athlete is rated as a possible
All-American, my job becomes
35% easier,” Beano says.

Throughout the year, Cook
sends stories on the individual he
is promoting to newspapers and

are used, there is a good chance
that the athlete will bcome known
nationally. Of course, an athlete
must be worthy of All-American
honors, Beano explained. Don
Hennon is one athlete Cook saw
become an All-American in bas-
ketball in 1958—’59.
Ditka This Year

Other athletes Cook has to his
All-American credit are Joe Wal-
ton, football end, ’56; John Guzik,
football guard, ’58; George
Schoeppner, baseball, ’59 and Mike
Ditka, football, ’60.

“Many publicity men make
the mistake of pushing an ath-
lete for All-American even
thought he isn’t of high cali-
ber,” Beano says. “By doing
this he causes sports writers to
lose faith in his judgment, and
he will not be believed when
he has a legitimate All-Ameri-
can. I make it a point never to
push an athlete for All-Ameri-
can unless he has exceptional.
ability. Of course if our team is
winning my work becomes eas-
ler.”

“He’s the greatest ‘tub-thumper’

college, — “we have had here,”
says Athletic Director Frank Car-
ver. He works 72 hours a day to
get his job dcne and it shows in
the quality of his work.”

He’s The Best

‘‘He’s the best there is,” says
Dick Sharbaugh, a rival publicity
man at Duquesne University, who
is also a friend of Beano’s._Other
men in sports such as Dudey
Moore, former Duquesne basket-
ball coach and presently LaSal1e
hoop coach, Mal Alberts of. WIIC
and Ray Scott, formerly of
WTAE-TV, all agree that Beano
Cook possesses a magnetic per-
sonality that helps him win friends
in sports. -

Beano’s greatest tribute to

date came in the winter Olym-
pic games when he was one of
14 publicists selected to aid the
public relations committee.

How much of a part Cook plays
in the making of an All-American
may always remain a point of
conjecture. The results of Beano’s
work, however, are impressive.
Some writers attribute his success
to a short-fused—temper.

When a Pitt basketball team
lost a one-sided game to West-
minster College, Cook took the
loss harder than the team. Fur-
ious over the team’s performance
that night ' and in other games,
Beano at 12:30 a.m. called Pitt
Athletic ‘Director Frank Carver
to discuss the plight of his be-
loved Panthers.

Pageantry Steals Spotlight
At Pitt Players Presentation
Of Medieval Play ‘Everyman’

Pageantry, pure and simple, stole the spotlight at Pitt
Players’ presentation of “Everyman” last Thursday in
Stephen Foster‘Memorial. The costuming was easily the best
part of the show, contributing the greatest part to the overall
dramatic effect. Pat Lennox and Kendall Stanley handled
this end of the production, and it is to them we offer our

congratulations.

“Everyman” can be a long,
drawn out, and tortuous affair,
but Michael McHale edited out
many of the boresome polemics in
which the characters ﬁnd them-

. selves in-need of second wind to

complete.

The deleted sermons made for a
much faster moving and absorbing
performance. In many instances
only a few brief lines from the
original context were essential for
the supporting players to convey
the truths each espouses.

Excellent Support

Especially eﬁective were Barry
Barner as Fellowship, Pat Lennox
as Good Deeds, Henry J. Luba as
Death, and Rosalie Stewart as
Knowledge. These particular dra-
matists were singled out for their
excellent supporting roles, al-
though in “Everyman” it is hard
to discern between importance for
each player.

They displayed an ability to
project their voices clearly and
with the proper emphasis, a tal-
ent not evidenced by many of
the others in the play. In the

lead characterization of Every-
man, Richard Walsack made a
valiant effort aand at times suc-
ceeded in living up to the de-
mands placed upon’his role. It
is diﬂicult to retain» the audi-
ence’s interest in a character so
obviously shallow, but with so
much to say.

Yet, his chief fault was the in-
ability to keep his speeches audi-
ble—a fault attributable to a raspy
voice which becomes distorted
when attempting to ﬂow along at
high speeds.

Opposite Extreme
On the opposite extreme there
were some especially ineffective
characterizations. It would be
poor policy to pan these people
publicly; however this element

was the only weak point of the.

performance. We realize Director
McHale would have a casting
problem during the third trimes-
ter, but it is a shame that he had
to employ some rather ‘stage-

_frightened and wishy-washy act-

Veteran Pitt Players Tom
Hall, Tony Lufrano, Kyp Park-
er, and Murray Susser by no
means ﬁt the latter category.
Each performed~ admirably as
Strength, Five Wits, Confession,
and Kindred respectively. Miss
Parker also sang the Vespers at
the end of the play well.

The Antiqua Players, led by
Colin Sterne, lent to the atmos-
phere of medieaval England. Their
musical accompaniment needs to
be praised.

Moved Indoors

Originally scheduled to be per-
formed outside, the show had to
be moved indoors to Foster Me-
It was
planned, that the play end at dusk,
which it indeed did, unfortunately
in the wrong environment.

In concluding we must salute
Pitt Players for their presenta-
tion of “Everyman,” which can
be deﬁned only as a difficult
play to work with. An obvious
moral lesson and ﬂat characters
can add up to a tiring evening,
but not in the case of this per-
formance.

Michael McHale managed to
maintain audience interest in a
dramafull of shallow characters—
chracters difficult to give life to.
He neatly weeded out Christian
overstatements, making “Every-
man” brief, religiously acceptable,
and beautiful.
