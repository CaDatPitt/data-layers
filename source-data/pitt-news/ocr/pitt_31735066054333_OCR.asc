School of education phases out four programs

Worldng toward redistributing its fund-
ing, Pitt’s school of education began this year
by closing its business, vocational, sports
studies, and physical education programs.

Vice Provost Jack Daniel said these
changes are not “cuts;” rather, they are “re-
allocations” within the University and the
departments.

Through a priority planning process, the

school of education earmarked these pro- '

grams to be “re—allocated” within the next
few years. '

“These priorities emerged ﬁem broad-
based planning committees of faculty, staff,
and students [throughout the University],”
said Kermeth Metz, dean of the School of
Education.

The planning process had these repre-
sentatives of the University place academic
programs into three categories according to
importance and academic excellence.

According to the March 8, 1996 plan-
ning document, category one includes “pro-
grams that deﬁne the ftmdamental character
of the school of education and are needed to
maintain high levels of quality professional
education.”

Category two deﬁnes “programs of high
quality that will be maintained only if
resources are available,” and Category three
includes “programs scheduled to be phased
out.”

‘”Ihe school of education’s category

three programs appeared in category three
because the school of education viewed
them as no longer within the mission of the
school, and also because of low‘ student
demand for these programs,” Daniel said.
“Also, the programs lack a critical mass of
faculty.” _

The school is phasing out these pro-
grams in order to invest in “lrigh-priority pro-
grams,” according to Metz. He attributes this
to higher education funding cuts in general.

Pitt students build race car

Steve Westrick

   

It might sound unusual to say that a
group of Pitt students are building a race
car from scratch, but to them, it’s not.
They do it every year. -

The Society of Automobile
Engineers met recently to unveil their
plans for the year, including the complete
construction of a working automobile
that they will race at a competition in
Pontiac, Michigan in May. The SAE’s
car will compete against cars from other
universities. '

These cars compete in various com-
petitions including: an acceleration run,
which tests the car’s ability to‘pick up
speed from a starting position; the skid-

" pad competition, which determines how

well the car can grip in a turn; the UT-
Cross, which tests the steering, suspen-
sion, and overall versatility of the car;

and finally the endurance race, where
each car must do 12 laps around a half-
mile track.

“We want to give that room the best
possible show we can give. We want
those cars (from previous years) cleaned
up. If we get everything right, it will be a
very impressive show,” Joel E. Peterson
told the 13-member team at a recent
meeting. ' _

Peterson, the advisor for this team,
has worked with the SAE in this same
aspect for the last six -years. I

— The presentation he spoke of will be
used both to recruit members for next
year’s team and to get the word out about

‘the car.

“We all know that we need to publi-
cize this car as much as possible,”
Peterson told his team.

These conferences are not unusual;

they will be held weekly throughout the .

An arduous weekend for the
members of the Student
Government Board ended with
satisfied smiles on the faces of

' four individuals. ‘

Brian Kaval_ukas, Valerie
Styduhar, and David Teeters were
sworn in as new members of the
Student Government Board and
Chris Boback was chosen to
assume the post of Elections
"Committee Chair.

SGB President Andy Wuertele
said that he is confident in the
Board’s appointments, but
stressed that the selection process
was not easy. a

“We had a very difficult time
deliberating in regards to the high
caliber of people that applied,”
said Wuertele. ‘

Candidates were asked to
complete an application and had
the opportunity to speak in an
open forum on Thursday. The fol-
lowing ‘day each candidate met
with the Board members for a
more formal interview.

New members were welcomed
against a backdrop of the tremen-
dous success of the SGB spon-
sored volunteer project that took
place on Saturday.

Resignations prompt
appointment of three
new SGB members

Pittsburgh Project” gathered 600
Pitt students to volunteer in vari-
ous capacities in the community.

Event organizer Justin
DalMolin expressed his gratitude
to the student body for maintain-
ing thespirit of the event despite
the adverse weather conditions.

“The Pittsburgh Project was
excellent despite the fact that the
heavens opened up at about 11
a.m. and kept up steadily all day,”
said DalMolin. _

The SGB also introduced two
projects to improve student safety
and academic endeavors on cam-
pus.
The Van Call system which
currently exists to respond to stu-
dent requests for transportation at
night is set to become more acces-
sible. Van Call hours will be
extended until 5 a.m. and another
van may be added to alleviate the
wait that occurs ‘between the
hours of 7:30 p.m.-3 a.m.

The teacher evaluations that
students are asked to fill out at the
end of each semester were also
discussed at the meeting. SGB
members are working to make the
evaluations available to students
so that they can make more
informed decisions when choos-
ing courses.

U.$. judge says Perot can
legally be left out of debates

Around the World

JERUSALEM —— Fearful of renewed
violence if the talks between Yasser
Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu fail,
Israeli troops took offensive positions
in the West Bank in the Gaza Strip.

Military officials said that tanks,
helicopters, and sniper squads were also
sent to the area to strengthen forces.

This comes after the Islamic mili-
tants warned attacks would occur when
the summit was finished. The fighting
began because of Israel’s opening of a
tunnel into one of Islam’s holiest sites.
Associated Press

UNITED NATIONS — The sanctions
imposed against Yugoslavia in 1992
were lifted Tuesday after a unanimous

vote by the United "Nations Security

Council. Their decision came only after
they certiﬁed that Bosnia’s recent elec-
tions were fair.

These sanctions were dissolved
only after Serbia, one part of what was
Yugoslavia, agreed to sign the Dayton
accord declaring peace on behalf of the
Bosnian Serbs.

Tuesday’s

action completely

removed all sanctions against the coun-
try that has just held its first fair elec-
tions. Pittsburgh Post—Gazette

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON — Despite alljof his
efforts, Ross Perot will not be allowed
to take part in any presidential debates.

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
F. Hogan regretfully ruled that he could
do nothing to overturn a private com-
n1ission’s decision not to let Perot into
the debates because he had no authority
to do so. . ' _

The judge admitted that by doing so
he was damaging Perot’s credibility and
chance to gain support, but claimed that
his hands were tied. Knight-Ridder

WASHINGTON — Jack Kevorkian
beware; assisted suicides may fall
under new scrutiny.

The Supreme Court agreed to hear
cases and decide whether the
Constitution allows doctors to assist in
speeding up the death process of termi-
nally ill patients if this is their wish.

Appeals from the states of New
York and Washington of decisions in
two federal appellate courts were
accepted by the justices. The two appel-
late courts ruled that if a patient was
mentally competent and terminally ill,
he had a right to doctor-assisted suicide.

THE PITT NEWS —

Singer tells environmental tales

.1/3» .~.’z .-"~'

She stood alone at the front of a
ground ﬂoor classroom in Forbes Quad
Monday night. With silence and about 25
people surrounding her, she began not a
lecture, but a song.

She was contemporary singer and
songwriter Alice Di Micele, whose two-
hour performance was sponsored by the
Student Environmental Action Coalition.
Di Micele, 31, was introduced by SEAC’s
Mike Kaizar, who described her as “the
renowned environmental, feminist, all
kinds of cool stuff singer.”

Di Micele has been touring all over
the country since 1988, but this is the ﬁrst
time she has performed at Pitt.

“I play colleges now and again, but I
mostly do a lot of clubs, Coffeehouses,
and festivals,” said Di Micele. Many of
these performances take place at Earth
Day events and women’s festivals.

SEAC leader Elly Glenn said her
organization usually tries to bring a singer
in once a year.

“She’s pretty famous among environ-
mental organizations,” said Glenn of Di
Micele.

Most of those present at the perfor-
mance were SEAC members, and Glenn
admitted the event had been “horribly
advertised” on campus. Fliers were dis-

tributed over the weekend, but several
SEAC members were on a camping trip
and could not help spread the word.

For those who came, Di Micele sang
several personal songs about healing and
dedicated them to those “who’ve gone
through a rough time.” She also sang

songs about the Earth, diversity, and rela- .

tionships. “I sing about life, basically,”
said Di Micele. ‘These are things that I
feel —- emotions and stuff.”

Honoring the requests of a couple of
members of the audience, she included a
song that expressed anger towards the
Animal Damage Control and ﬁsh and
wildlife rangers.

‘These groups attempt to ‘manage’
things by killing predators and ‘pest’ ani-
mals,” explained Di Micele before begin-
ning the selection.

The singer’s resonant, sort of bluesy
voice carried outside the classroom, and
lured several passersby to the door. Di
Micele called out to them.from the front
of the room, inviting them to come in to
enjoy the free concert. She did a few
songs a cappella, but played the guitar
while singing most of the others. For sev-
eral of her selections, she invited the audi-
ence to participate by singing along with
her.

“It gets lonely singing by yourself,”
said Di Micele. “I just want to share the
fun of singing.”

Cutbacks

“My perception of the situation in higher
education, not only in Pennsylvania, but

across the country, is that federal funds have

been curtailed. Universities have been
wrestling with tuition problems,” he said

Daniel also cited ﬁmding cuts among a
number of reasons for these re-allocations.
“Pennsylvania is near the bottom in state aid
to higher education,” he said. ‘The second
reason would be reductions in federal fund-
ing.” »

Daniel said maintenance costs, such as
classroom renovations, inﬂation, and caps on
tuition, inﬂuence where the University
spends its money. He said these cutbacks are
necessary in order for Pitt to spend its money
on students, where the University needs it
most.

Even with the cutbacks, the school of
education will have to develop new sources
of revenue through fundraising and new
research grants and donations from individ-
uals and private foundations.

Daniel said he doesn’t think these.

changes will affect enrollment because the
re-focused school of education will attract
more students with more of what those stu-
dents want.

“We’re trying to develop a school of
education which will have an international
reputation in terms of excellent programs,
students, faculty, and staff,” Daniel said.
“Our hope is that this high—quality, reconﬁg-
ured school of education will draw more stu-

na-An$¢niirop-rt-.vA:L1daiA:.L‘x-Zunii.

 

FROM PAGE I

dents than the school of education of the
past”

New students are not the only people
affected by these cutbacks. There is still a
question of what will happen to the teachers
of the programs being “phased out.”

According to Daniel, Pitt will not ﬁre
tenured faculty in those programs, but will
put them in other positions within the School
of Education.

‘The school plans [to]  take the

salaries resulting from faculty retirements or
 resignations and re—allocate those salaries
to higher—priority programs,” Daniel said.
“Similarly, there will be a re-allocation of the
frmds we use to support those faculty mem-
bers.” .

However, the question of how this will
affect students currently enrolled in these re-
allocated programs still remains. Daniel said
no students will forfeit their diplomas
because of the cutbacks.

“We will guarantee all students the
opportunity to graduate,” said Daniel.

No new students will be permitted to
enter the classes, and students who ﬁnish by
1999 will still have the opportunity to obtain
teaching certiﬁcation and complete Master’s
degrees immediately after graduation.

Daniel conﬁrmed the ﬁfth-year teacher
certiﬁcation program as increasing and pro-
jected to continue growing in enrollment,
emphasizing that these re-allocations are not
expected to hinder overall enrollment.

Debaters argue: the ’ net, porno industry tool r private fun?

 

To better inform students about
the pros and cons of censoring
cyberporn, the American Criminal
Justice Association and Lambda

Alpha Epsilon sponsored. a
“Censorship on the internet Debate”
last Wednesday in the William Pitt
Union.

Whether parents or the govern-
ment gets to decide what children
can watch and cannot watch on the
internet became the main issue of
the debate. .

The participants in the event
were Dorn E. Checkley, executive

 

 
  
   
 
 

ma PITT NEWS

director of the Pittsburgh Coalition
Against Pornography and Marketa
Sims, president of the Pittsburgh
chapter of American Civil Liberties
Union. ‘

Checkley, in favor of censoring
pornographic material on the inter-
net, emphasized the importance of
restricting cyberporn from easy
access by young children.

“The pornographic industry is
greedy and will try to hook children
to cyberporn from an early age so
they will be addicted as adults,”
Checkley said. He said making
passwords a priority to insure view-
ers of these sites are of age is one of
the best ways to prevent children

Marketa Sims argued against
the censorship of pornographic
material on the internet, and said
using the internet is a private "func-
tion, not a public one.

“Using the internet is like hav-
ing a telephone conversation with
someone that includes pictures on
the screen. The government has no
right to barge in on that,” she said.
“It’s not the responsibility of the
providers of the services to provide
[passwords].”

She said the issue becomes
parental control, not governmental
control.

“Will we allow. mom or dad to

decide, or the federal government to
barge in?” Sims said.

She suggested that parents use
software such as “Surf—watch” to
limit access to certain web sites
instead of having the whole internet
censored by the government.

However, Checkley said having
access codes to enter cyberporn
sites on the internet is nothing dif-

ferent from being carded at theaters '

or liquor stores.

“Parental control is important
but parents cannot have the sole
responsibility of supervising the
child,” he said

Checkley asked the audience
about what is supposed to happen
when parents disagree over cyber-
porn issues.

“What happens when Mom says
no, and dad says yeah? Children
will take that as a sign of weak con-
trol,” Checkley. said. _

Like Hillary Clinton, he said he
believes it takes a whole village to
raise - a child. “Family cannot
always be together and the govern-
ment should have a firm interest,”
he said. '

In her rebuttal, Sims maintained

conducted in these matters instead
of the government to ensure the
First Amendment is not infringed
upon. _

“It comes down to money and
greed” Checkley argued, “and not
the welfare of the children.”

Sims disagreed and said the
internet “is not at all about money.”
She also brought up the issue of
who gets to make the decision to
put an access code on sites.

“Parents can certainly trace the
footsteps of their children, and it’s
not appropriate for the government
to intervene.,” she said. “The bur-
den should not be placed on the
providers to decide what goes on
and off.”

 construction of the car. The time scale for
f’ building this car is lengthy. It started
 when team members, who are all stu-

l

dents in the engineering school, returned

 from their summer breaks.

“We expect to have [the car] opera-
tional by late February, early March at
the latest,” said Danick Gula, current
president of SAE. “If we get it completed
early, we can test it out on some tracks

.0 before the competition [in May].”

After the details of the presentation

1, were worked out, the talk in the confer-

I

ence room moved on to speciﬁcs of pro-
duction.

Matt Baker, co-captain of the team,
who is in charge’ of constructing the
frame, told the team they need to decide
on a number for the car.

“Number one,” a team member
shouted out. \

“Can’t. The first 10 numbers are
saved for the first ten ﬁnishers from last
year,” Baker said.

Last year’s team failed to ﬁnish in
the top 10, and the best any SAE team
has ﬁnished was eighth in 1992.

Baker, along with Paul Bobke, Brad
Eichenlaub, Rich Yurocko, and Frank
Ostrowski, was a member of last year’s
SAE team, while the other eight people
are new to the team this year.

The next decision the team must
make is whether they want to add
adjustable gas and brake pedals. This was

a new feature on last year’s car, but took
a lot of work to install. Still, the team
feels the pedals are necessary because six
different drivers will be needed at the

_competition, and the heights of the team

members vary.

The talk in the conference room
became even more serious as Bobke
talked about the turbo engine. Bobke has
the unenviable task of being in charge of
constructing the engine. He told the team
that because of limited funding he will
use the same block used two years ago.

The budget for the car. comes from
two main sources — Packer Electric,
which is a division of General Motors
and annually donates $7,500, and the
Student Government Board, which gives

an additional $4,800.

At the presentation, the cars from the
last two years are on display along with
pictures showing the various tests per-
formed on each car before it is allowed to
compete in any of the events.

These tests include a noise test, a tilt
test (the car is tilted at a 60—degree angle
to make sure no ﬂuids are leaking), and a
safety test, where all the members of the
team must be able to get out of the car
from a strapped-in position in ﬁve sec-
onds. , -

Around 50 interested students
attended the presentation. .

Baker told the audience that the
judges for the competition are made up of
representatives from various car compa-
nies.

“At this competition you’re not only
selling the car to the judges, you’re sell-

{ Thursday, ocrober 3, 996 A THE pm NEWS 5

ing it to the open market and the world,”
said Baker.

Peterson points out that the competi-
tion gives members of the team a chance
to impress representatives in the automo-
tive industry. “In a good year, four to ﬁve
members of the team will get hired
because of their work on the car,” he
said.

Peterson said he feels the team mem-
bers learn about more than just cars by
participating in this project.

“There is really two ways to look at
this whole thing. The students look atjit
from a competitional aspect, but I look at
it from an educational aspect,” he said. “I
think that the whole educational system
is based on individual achievements. But
this requires teamwork. All the members
of the team have to sacriﬁce their own

. ideas for the betterment of the group.”

Dear University Community,

This weekend, PITT will be honoring the National
Championship team of 1976. As a member of that team, it’s hard
to believe that 20 years have gone by. .

I remember being l‘-10 in my freshman year  There were only
10 showers, 15 bars of soap, and never enough clean towels to go
around. Even the equipment and facilities were from the Jock
Sutherland era. PITT was at an all—time low!

With the help of new coaches, fresh talent, and improved
facilities, our team went from 1-10 to 12-0 in ﬁve years time.
Red-shirted in my sophomore year, I had the luxury of being a
part of the National Championship Team. Beating Notre Dame at
the Golden Dome and pounding Penn State on Thanksgiving day
— the memories don’t get any better than this! Thank you PIIT
for the quality education and the great times remembered.

The PITT spirit is still alive! I’ve gone from being #1 in ‘76 as
a player to being #1 in ‘96 as the top manufacturer of licensed
PITT products in the country. There are 329 licensed

The Supreme Court has ﬁnally decided to hear cases regard-
ing physician-assisted suicide. The states of New York and

Washington are arguing in defense of 19th century laws which _

make it illegal for anyone to assist in a suicide. The appeals will be
heard in January. ~

The decision being appealed was arrived at by two separate
appeals courts which stated in each case that there was virtually no
difference between removing the artiﬁcial means which are pre-
serving a life and actively prescribing the means for a terminally
ill person to end his life.

The Supreme Court ruling this decision was based on was
made six years ago. It states that a person has the right to refuse to
have his life prolonged by artiﬁcial means. The right to refuse such
treatment was found to have fallen under the liberty provision of
the 14th Amendment which gives the right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.

We have to agree with the appellate courts. A person should
have the right to decide the manner in which he will live, and the
manner in which he will die, if at all possible. It should be up to

the terminally ill individual to decide his time to die. Physicians w

should be able to assist him in whatever ways he sees ﬁt.

Of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the most neces-
sary would be liberty. You have the liberty to live your life. You
have the liberty to choose what exactly you pursue to gain happi-
ness. You should have the liberty to decide when enough is enough
in the ﬁght with a terminal illness and to turn to a doctor’ for help.

This is not to say that we support Dr. Jack Kevorkian. In fact,
the opposite is true. He has done more to prevent physician-assist-
ed suicide than he has to make it an acknowledged medical fact.
Studies have shown that assisted suicides for tenninally ill patients

have always existed  the medical profession. By turning this '

sacred medical act into a media circus, Dr. Kevorkian has done no
one but himself any favors. '

Hopefully, the Supreme Court will be the ﬁnal voice of rea-
son in protecting the one true option terminally ill patients have.
Physician~assisted suicide should be a constitutionally protected
act.

Club sports deserve
recognition just like
the varsity sports

I agree that there are -other
varsity sports such as volley-
ball, baseball, wrestling, and
swimming which deserve
recognition. But aren’t you for-
getting something?

What about the club
sports? They are also sports
which receive some funding
from the University — not
enough to get by, but they do
receive some funding. They
would have received more
funding if the University did
not waste our money on 85
stiffs who can’t tackle, catch,
run, block, kick, pass, or beat
Houston.

The club sports range from
rugby and ﬁeld hockey to ice
hockey, lacrosse, crew and a
slew of others. So why aren’t
we mentioned as athletes? We
all play sports which are physi-
cally taxing, and in the case of
rugby, three times as taxing as
football and soccer combined.
We are also students. We go
through the same daily grind as
these varsity’ athletes, except
we have to worry about buying
equipment, traveling expenses,
and finding a field to play on.

Varsity athletes do not have
those concerns and yet are
unable to perform. So why
aren’t we recognized? Some of
these club sports, in the past
four years, have posted better
overall records than, let’s ‘say,
the football team.

Wake up, athletic depart-
ment, and add some real sports

and hop off the Majors band-
wagon. And Pitt News, how
about some coverage to help
give our club sports the recog-
nition they deserve?

Religion isn't the
only conceptto
have faith in

In response to Jay
DeMartino’s article on truth
and faith, I think there are three
types of faith. Ordinarily we
may associate faith with reli-
gious convictions, but as
DeMartino has rightly pointed
out this is not wholly appropri-
ate. Even in the world of “hard
science” there are revolutions
in which -previously held con-
victions must be abandoned in
favor of new theories that more
accurately assess our reality.

The first type of faith is
religious, or spiritual, faith in
which we are guided by emo-
tional, or intuitive, senses that
are impossible to prove.
Despite arguments to the con-
trary, there is nothing wrong
with belief by religious inspira-
tion. Indeed, it is a psychologi-
cal characteristic that might be
thought of as naturally human.

What do I mean? Life is
tough. There are often no

rewards for the just, and no
punishments for the wicked. It
is naturally healthy to imagine
salvation, to believe without
empirical proof. In an age
where the modes of our belief
have increasingly been dorni—
nated by the hegemony of sci-
ence, we should not_ feel
ashamed of this essentially
human, sympathetic impulse.

_ The second mode of faith is
science. Science demands hard
tests, rigorous proofs, and visu-
al evidence that something
either physically is, or is not.
Faith by science and faith by
religion have been at logger-
heads for a long time. I do not
believe that they should be.
Why? Science has shown us
how to control, inﬂuence, and
alter our world. Religious her-

itage must spring to the task of '

suggesting how that may be
done ethically.

_ Thirdly, there is political
belief. This is between what is
empirically proven, and that
which arises by" religious inspi-
ration. Faith by political con-
viction may be seen as a middle
ground between the other two.

In conclusion, I wish to re-
emphasize that it may be equal-

ly as important to question the _

manner by which we come to
believe as it is to ask ourselves
what we actually believe. If
there is a disproportionate
reliance of faith in one camp or
another, ask yourself: Why? If
we only understood the schism
and paths of faith by which we
come to hold our convictions, it
may be easier to understand
those of others.

Rye
the words scribbled repeatedly on
a wall. Why was he so troubled
that he couldn’t rub the words
away? We were all so surprised to
hear those words in class, I don’t
think anyone. could breathe, let
alone answer.

Lying in bed that night, the
covers bunched up around me, I
poured through the novel in a few
hours. Salinger’s character
seemed to know exactly what I
was feeling, the kind of things
everybody feels as they grow
older, what I imagine everybody
feels until the day they die.

It was the first time I’d ever
read anything that really touched
me. If a book is powerful enough
to have made a no—account student
like me sit up and actually do
work, I could see why people
wanted it banned. If it had been up
to me, however, everyone-would
have read ,the damn thing.

And I think everyone did, at
least in my class. I wasn’t the only
one lounging in there who always
seemed to find staring out the
window more important than
answering questions. But soon we

were fighting over who got to‘

talk, straining our arms towards

the ceiling to offer our own per- "
sonal interpretations of “what the _

book was about.” And all of it was
somehow. secret and forbidden,
like the banned book itself —
which only encouraged us more.
That made our class talks even

more lively and candid, our voices .

filling the room and hanging there
like smoke. We delved into every
section of the book, from things
like Holden Caulfield’s unortho-
dox meeting with a prostitute, to
his (and our) confusion and anger
towards religion, and finally to
the famous, and infamous, “Fuck
You” chapter. All the things we
needed -to talk about, regardless of
whether we were “allowed” to.

It was a good thing our teacher
closed his door before each dis-
cussion. I can’t help but think, had
the school administrators heard
what was in that book, that they’d
have torn them from our hands
and sent us all to detention as sin-

ners. They didn’t, but others have, '

and still do.
Closing someone’s mind is the

meaning behind those “fuck yous”-

put into action. Holden Caulfield
couldn’t erase them, and we can’t
either. People still say it today,
and they will continue to say it
forever. All I can say is don’t lis-
ten to them.

loud, and keep reading.’

this notoriety is good for the work,

and sometimes it is not. This notori-

 

ety caused many hip intellectual ;

“Cancer,” but at the same time their
reasons for reading the book may not
have been “pure.”

Most people picked the book up

looking for some steamy sex, and in ~

my opinion, it just isn’t in there. Sure,
there are graphic depictions of sex,
complete with words like “cunt,”
“cock,” and “twat,” but Miller’s
intention as a writer was never to tan-
talize the reader. His writing is life-
affirming, thought-provoking, and
inspirational to say the least. If you
haven’t read any of Miller’s work, I
would strongly suggest reading some-
thing by him. “Tropic of Cancer” is as
good a place to start as any.

how to grow weed in an apartment, in

some Schweppe’s ginger ale.

Powell reminds me of that

enough recipes to severely injure the

Some laughed, some cried; I stared at
the stage quite blankly. Yet (later) the char- .
acter of Eleonora Duse, lying on a couch/bed
and babbling to the audience in Italian about
her life, enlightened me.

The one—woman production about

Eleonora Duse, “L’Ultima Notte a

In the 1920s, Duse was renowned for
her acting abilities. She performed all the the
world before coming to Pittsburgh to per-
form in “La Porta Chiusa” (“The Closed
Door”). Her health had begun to fail, ‘and

Suite 524 at the Schenley Hotel, now the
William Pitt Union.

Everyone knows, or has at least heard

of, the many celebrities that stayed in the ‘

Schenley Hotel, the jazz memorial on the
main ﬂoor, and the Gene Kelly star outside.
However, in the Red Room (that room
next to the jazz hall on the main ﬂoor with
the red furniture), there is a lesser known
memorial. An odd stairway leads up to the
ceiling, plateaus, and leads back down,
framing this large bronze plaque. It was cre-
ated and dedicated by actors .and opera
singers 25 years after her deaﬂi. It reads: '
Eleonora Duse / World tragedienne of the
Italian theatre in the glory of her immortal art
answered her last curtain in Pittsburgh/Apiil
21, 1924. '

Castaneda provides us with an incred-

summed up neatly here. However, a quote
from Don Juan may serve to share the ﬂa-

Writers like myself often
get criticized for casually using
words like “legendary” when
referring to independent rock-
ers and musicians on the so-
called “fringe.” This criticism
may sometimes be warranted,
as it is never a good idea to
assume that your readers have
the same perception of what is
“legendary” as you do.

In the case of Mr. Jad
Fair, however, I feel entirely
justified referring to the man as
a-legend. He is a living, breath-
ing, performing, rock ‘n roll
legend, and he is coming to
Pittsburgh.

Jad Fair began his illustri-
ous recording and performing
career while growing up in
Michigan in the late ‘70s, play-
ing with his brother David in

their (then) duo, Half
Japanese. Since that time,
Half Japanese has gone
through dozens of lineup

changes, released dozens of
records, and J ad has had almost
as many side projects. David
Fair is a family man now, and
doesn’t play with _ Half
Japanese anymore, but he still
does their album cover art.
Half Japanese are the ulti-
mate garage band; they

embody the DIY ethic of
PUNK ROCK. Instructions for
how to play a guitar have
accompanied their records
(“the skinny strings make the
high—pitched sounds, and the
fatter strings make the low
sounds  you can play it real
fast or real slow”), and Penn
Jillette (of Penn & Teller fame)
is a big fan of their work; he
even put out one ' of their
records. But the really essential
thing about Jad Fair’s work is
his heartfelt earnestness and
his totally believable
lovesongs.

ad Fair (second from right) and DQE play the show of a lifetime this Sunday at Charlie’s.

A couple years ago
ORGONE CINEMA showed
Half Japanese: The Band That
Would Be King, one of the very
best documentaries I’ve ever
seen (actually, it was one of the
best films I’ve ever seen peri-
od). If anyone ever gets a
chance to check this film out, I
would highly recommend
doing so. It will truly change
your life, or at least help you to
approachit with a little more
hope.

Anyway, Jad is coming to
Pittsburgh with the members of

people out there working to
restrict others’ access to infor-
mation.

There are two books I can
recommend to anyone curious
about this phenomenon. George
Orwell’s “l984” shows the real
motive behind those who try to
restrict people’s access to infor-
mation, change their language,
and hold in check their lives.
What these people hope to gain
is control. Sometimes, it is
done in the name of achieving a
higher goal, but there is no way
to be sure of the value of an

book has been banned for its
sexual content and its presenta-
tion of a futuristic dis-topia.
The second book I’d rec-
ommend is “Fahrenheit 451,”
by Ray Bradbury. The rumor
mills out of Hollywood has it
that this will soon be a major
motion picture" starring Mel

- Gibson, but part of the point of

the book is the importance of
reading. The story focuses on a
ﬁreman, -only his job is to set
fires in order to burn books. His
wife, who is held out in stark
contrast, has a room full of tele-

This book has similar
themes to “1984,” but there is a
different twist and the ending is
happier. Bradbury’s afterward
is also important reading.

One more book that has
been banned that should be
read by every college student is
“Catch—22,” by Joseph Heller.
This novel describes the work-
ings of bureaucracies, and how
one might be able to function
within them. Of course the

There is one book that
ought to be added here:
“Entertaining Ourselves to

is a non-ﬁction book about tele-

Twenty years have
passed since Pitt’s 1976
12-0 National
Championship season, but
to former player Chas
Bonnsate it seems like yes-
terday. Bonnsate, simply
known as Chas,
jovial vendor down at the
Pitt Stop on the comer of
Forbes and Bigelow.

Bonnsate came to Pitt
as a freshman in 1972. He
got his scholarship by
chance when a friend, who
owned a local bar that Pitt
coaches frequented to
watch Monday night foot-
ball, showed Bonnsate’s
game film. The coaches
liked what they saw and
they gave him a scholar-
ship.

Pitt went 1-10 in 1972.
The team was in shambles
and facilities were horren-
dous. Bonnsate recalls only
12 showers for over 100
guys, not enough clean
towels and makeshift
equipment that was sewn
together.

“Pitt was so bad that
the lines_ for the showers
looked like cattle lines,”
Bonnsate said. “Everyday
the freshmen were last and
by the time we got to the

is the _

shower there was a foot of
water that we had to search
through to find soap. Then
when we got out we had to
use wet towels or just run
around naked. It was crazy
and that was Pitt football.”

The next year Johnny
Majors came to town and a
national championship
would come just four years
later. Majors and assistant
Jackie Sherrill brought a
new discipline and work
ethic to the team.

“They made us do
Marine training,” said
Bonnsate. “We were up in
the wrestling room learning
the new training for the
first time and someone got

V sick. The coaches blew the

whistle and they said, ‘You
never quit. If you’re sick or
tired, you never quit.”’

In the first year, 60
players either quit or trans-‘
ferred because they could-
n’t take the workouts. So
Majors brought in all new
players. T

“I’ll never forget when
we were doing a sprinting
drill and a guy went over to
the side and got sick and he
was gone. the next day.
That’s how tough it was,”
said Bonnsate.

One moment that
Bonnsate will always
remember came when

Apparently Tony Dorsett was quite the prankster

Pitt. 5 C 0

during his glory years at Pitt.

Sherrill took off his
National Championship
ring from Alabama and
rolled it down the ﬂoor of
the locker room and told
the team, “If you listen to
us you’ll get one of these.”

Little did Bonnsate
know that the scrawny,
.150-pound kid in the cor-
ner was the next great run-
ningback in college foot-
ball,/Tony Dorsett.

“Dorsett was a tough
player,” Bonnsate said.
“Teams tried to hurt him all
the time. In one game, he
got speared and had to
come out, but he begged
the coaches to let him in
and he helped win the
game.”

The team was very
close. Players from differ-
ent backgrounds and parts
of the country made up a
close knit team. Practical
jokes were a part of the
camaraderie. Bonnsate
remembers when he

Dorsett’s name on a road
trip. The next practice,
Dorsett was kept after prac-
tice for extra conditioning.
“We never were
allowed to order room ser-
vice, but we would always
try and at this hotel it
worked,” said Bonnsate.

-“Tony was in the shower,

so I ordered for him and

myself, and when the bill *

came,,I charged it to his
room.” .

Dorsett would get his
revenge by soaking
Bonnsate’s hotel bed on
both sides and then he left
his signature on the bottom
of the bed which read,
“Have a wet dream, TD.”

Heading into the 1976
season, Pitt had all the
pieces to win a national
championship: Dorsett, the
best runner in college foot-
ball history, a consistent
drop-back passer in Matt

Cavanaugh, and a tremen-C .

dous defense. For pre-sea-

football, like picking winners

 

Like most Pitt students, I grew up in
Western Pennsylvania. And, like most
Western Pennsylvanians, I love my football.
A winning basketball team is fantastic, and
Pitt wrestling (as well as all wrestling in this
area) is always among the nation’s best. But
as far as I’m concerned, there are really only
three sports seasons: football season, football
recruiting season, and spring football season.
And high school football? Many in these
parts swear there’s nothing better — profes-
sional football included.

_ Havingsaidallofthat,I’llbetheﬁrstto
swallow my Western PA pride and admit that
wemay have to take a back seat to the pas-
sion for football in the Deep South. And
nothing has stirred more passion and contro-
versy down south than Termessee quarter-
back Peyton Marming’s decision to spum his
old.man’s alma mater, Mississippi, in favor

of the Volunteers. Archie Manning is almost‘

like God in Mississippi, and he is at least like
the Pope across the rest of the Deep South.
Theoldmanwas expectedto steerhis sonto
Ole Miss, and it was considered treasonous
when Manning settled on Termessee. Tonight
on ESPN may be the most emotional college
game this year when Marming faces Ole
Miss for the first, and probably only, time in
his career. Manning’s nerves should be
calmed somewhat by the fact that the game
was moved from Oxford to neutral site
Memphis, but that won’t be enough to pre-
vent this stunning upset First Blue Plate
Upset Special - Mississippi 31, Tennessee

Duke (04) at Navy (2-1) —— The ser-
vice acadernies’ combined record now stands

sider that there’s not a single player at Army,

reason other than to get -a superior education.
Note of local interest: Army returns to the Pitt

Nebraska (2-1) at Kansas State (4-0)
— Even more surprising than the service
academies’ combined 8-2 record is the recent
success of Kansas State and Kansas. It was-
n’t that long ago that these programs were the
two biggest jokes in college football, but no
one is laughing now. An indication of how far
these two programs have come, aside ﬁorn
their combined 6-1 record, is the fact that
Kansas Coach Glen Mason turned down one
of the best jobs in the country, Georgia, last
year, in order to stay at Kansas. Nebraska
29, Kansas State 24.

Michigan (4-0) at Northwestern (3-1)
— Northwestern still isn’t getting much
national respect, having been only a three-
point favorite last week over pathetic lrrdiana
(a game they won, 35-17). Then again, they
did lose in week one to even more pathetic
Wake Forest. Northwestern doesn’t have
anything close to the talent of Michigan, but
heart, enthusiasm, and good coaching count
for just as much as talent Second Blue Plate
Upset Special — Northwestern 28,
Michigan 24.

Temple (1-3) at Pitt (1-4) — Speaking
oftalent, asbadasPittisatthispointinthe
season, there’s probably not a player on
Temple’s roster who was a good enough
prospect in high school to have been serious-
ly recruited by Pitt Thene’s simply no way
Pitt should ever lose to Temple because
there’s simply no comparison in talent level.
By the way, in case you’re keeping score at
home, some of the names that popped up last
week on local talk shows concerning Pitt’s
next head coach are as follows (whether Pitt
is actually interested in any of them, or
whether Majors is deﬁnitely a goner, I have
no idea): Pitt alums “Iron Mike” Ditka and
Matt Cavanaugh, Jim Tressel (Youngstown
State head coach), Bob Davie (Notre Dame
defensive coordinator), Tommy Bowden
(Auburn assistant and brother of Terry/son of
Bobby), and Steve Logan (East Carolina
head coach). Pitt 42, Temple 21.

Guest Pick of the Week, the
Honorable Emil Narick; Boston College
(2-2) at West Virginia (5-0) — Judge
Narick, who sits on the Commonwealth
Comt of Pemrsylvania, quarterbacked the Pitt
Panthers in 1939, the ﬁrst post-Jock
Sutherland team Narick took the reigns after
serving as an understudy to Curly Stebbins-,
who quarterbacked the 1938 Pitt Panthers
and was a member of the legendary “Dream
Backﬁeld,” which is Pitt’s version of the
“Four Horsemen,” only better. Judge
Narick’s football credentials also include
many years as a major college referee and a
stint as an assistant coach for West Virginia.

Our final NHL prediction —
Avalanche buries the Flyers

Marc Rpsenberg

.._,,__. J.’

       

Here, for personal enjoyment, is
the final installment in this week’s
1996-97 NHL preview — the project-
ed order of finish for the Pacific
Division. And please remember — no
wagering.

1. Colorado Avalanche (last season:
47-25-10, 1st)

The Avalanche return as the
Stanley Cup Champions after a sweep
of the Florida Panthers in last season’s
finale. The title defense is always
tougher than winning the first time,
and by keeping this squad intact,
Colorado has easily assured them-
selves another trip to next year’s
championship. ,

Colorado is an offensive machine.
With a first line of Peter Forsberg,

Claude Lemieux, and Valeri
Kamensky and a second line of Joe
Sakic, Scott Young, and newly-

acquired Eric Lacroix, the Avalanche
will frustrate opposing goalies
throughout the
s e a s o n .
Lacroix, 25,
doubled his
offensive out-
put in two
years of pro experience with the Los
Angeles Kings. One can predict he"ll
elevate those numbers once again on a
line with Sakic and Young.

Fortunately, the Avalanche are just
as strong defensively. Uwe Krupp,
who missed most of last season due to
a severe knee injury, recovered mirac-
ulously and scored 16 points in the
1996 playoffs. Sandis Ozolish, Adam
Foote, and Sylvian Lefevre also return
to a team overloaded with a solid blue-
line brigade. .

As for the goaltending situation,
the acquisition of Patrick Roy was and
will stand as one of the greatest trades
in franchise history. A full season with
Roy between the pipes will guarantee
this squad a 50—win season and anoth-
er Stanley Cup.

2. Vancouver Canucks (32-35-15,
3rd)

The Canucks look to get back on
the right playoff track after a season of
setbacks in 1995-96.

Vancouver turns to new head
coach Tom Renney to lead his troops
into battle with a fully recovered Pavel
Bure and a rejuvenated Alexander
Mogilny. Mogilny is coming off his
most productive season since 1993.

Renney will look to center Trevor
Linden and wingers Martin Gelinas
and Russ Courtnall to pick up the rest
of the slack. Linden put up career
numbers last season with 33 goals and

PART 4 or 4  

 

88 points.

For Vancouver, Stanley Cup hopes
will depend on defense. Jyrki Lumme
leads a relatively inexperienced group
of blueliners into this season. Other
than Bret Hedican and Dana Murzyn,
blueline solidarity is a missing ingredi-
ent in this Canuck squad.

3. Edmonton Oilers (30-44-8, 5th)

The days of Wayne Gretzky and
Mark Messier are long gone. But the
Oilers, brimming with b1ue—chippers
and a solid goaltender, Curtis Joseph,
look to return to the playoffs for the
first time in five years.

The Oilers are loaded with emerg-
ing offensive talent. They already have
a proven scorer in center Doug Weight.
Weight finished last season with 79
assists and 104 points, tops on the
squad. Jason Arnott contributed 59
points despite playing only 64 games.
With youngsters Mariuz Czerkawski
(24), Miroslav Satan (22) and Todd
Marchant (23), the Oilers may not be a
dynasty-in-the—making, but are cer-
tainly a force to be reckoned with in
coming years.
4. Anaheim
Mighty Ducks
(35-39-8, 4th)

D i s n e y ’ s
“Hockey Show
on Ice” had made tremendous strides
since joining the ranks of the NHL. In
their third season, the Mighty Ducks
tied Winnipeg for the final playoff spot
in last year’s Western Conference but
missed out because of a tie-breaker.

Head Coach Ron Wilson looks to
lead his squad to their first playoff
berth in history with some fierce ﬁre-
power up front. Paul Kariya and
Teemu Selanne combined for 90 goals
last season, while forwards Steve
Rucchin and Roman Oksiuta should

‘produce points as well.

Unfortunately, the Ducksf defense
has more holes than they can handle.
Frederick Olausson and Bobby Dollas
are heading into the twilight of their
careers, and they traded Jason York,
26, in a four-player deal Tuesday to
Ottawa. They have future prospects,
but they won’t be ready to step into the
spotlight for a few seasons.

5. Calgary Flames (34-37-11, 2nd)

While Calgary finished second
behind Colorado last season, let’s look
at the bigger picture. This team was
one point away from missing the play-
offs.

The Flames are a squad that pos-
sesses some talent and plenty of
prospects. Theo Fluery has established
himself as one of the league’s best for-
wards despite being 5-foot-6 and
weighing 160 pounds. Fleury, 28, led

Get off our backs, it's not our fault you lose

 

Being a journalist isn’t the
easiest job in the world. Then
again, nothing really comes
easy in this world, now does it?
Deadlines must be met, phone
calls must be made, and never,
ever even think of rnisquoting
someone or you will have a
lawsuit slapped on you before
you can blink your eyes.

Nonetheless, not many
sportswriters complain about
their jobs. Think about it,

watching people play games,_

analyzing those games, and
then putting minds to work to
produce high-quality inforrna—

tion about those games so peo-

ple that missed out don’t feel
that way. It can be the life, if
you know how ‘to do it right.
Knowing exactly what to do
all the time is impossible in
sports journalism, though.
Sometimes things just don’t
happen the way you‘ might

want and what you planned on,

doing is worthless. Start from
scratch and deliver a great
story, but do it before 10:00
_p.m. That isn’t uncommon, but
we deal with it.

Dealing with adversity;
funny I should mention that.
This past week it was brought
to my attention that some
members of the Pitt
student/athlete community
were unhappy with the cover-
age they have been getting in
these pages that we call home.
They cursed and fumed over
the negative attitudes that were
displayed in the writing of
some staff members. They
even went as far as to threaten

‘bodily harm on some particu-
lar writers. That would be a
good match, huh?

When I heard about these
unhappy athletes, I immediate-
ly thought to myself about the
time last year when I stuck up
for the student/athletes and
talked about how most of the
student body hereat Pitt, and
across the country, doesn’t
really understand the pressure
that is on the shoulders of these
kids. These kids that aren’t too
much different than everyone

Our bosses tell us what

the same thing of athletes and

to look the other way and for-

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

An in depth look of Temple  

Mike Kovak

 

 

Even Pitt Head’ Coach Johnny
Majors thinks the 1996 Pitt football
troops look worse than the 1995 team
that compiled a 2-9 record and went
winless in the Big East.

Last season, it appeared Pitt foot-
ball reached an all-time low after they
lost to Temple 29-27 on Oct. 14.

It is evident that both programs are
undergoing long—term rehabilitation
processes. However, the Owls might
be further along than the Panthers.

The big 7 difference between
Majors and Temple Coach Ron
Dickerson is their outlooks towards the
more immediate future. Majors isn’t
impressed with much of anything
these days, but Dickerson exudes
excitement about the Owls, who are 1-
3 overall. —

“I wish we’d had more wins, no ‘

question,” Dickerson said. “But I think
we’ve made good progress.”

Majors knows about the potential

of Temple.

“Temple is improved over last
year,” he said, “and we have to
improve tremendously this week to be
improved at all.” I

A major reason for Temple’s
improvement is its backﬁeld.

Few people outside of
Philadelphia know about Temple quar-

-terback Henry Burris. In 1994, Burri_s

was second-team all Big East and
ranks on several conference passing
lists. Currently, Burris ranks fourth on
the all—time Big East completion (470)
and passing yardage (6,185) lists. His
41 touchdown passes also place him
fourth in Big East history. The 6,056
yards of total offense the senior has
amassed in his career place him sixth
all-time in the conference.

This season, Burris has held up his
end of the Temple offense. He has
completed a career-high 52.9 percent
(54 of 102) of his passes for 774 yards.
Through four games, he’s tossed four
touchdowns and four interceptions.

The touchdown numbers aren’t as
impressive as when he tossed 21 in
1994, but the emergence of Eugene
Culbreath and Ramod Lee in the back-
ﬁeld have alleviated some of the pres-
sure from Bunis.

Culbreath leads the Owls with 185
yards on 54 carries, not extremely
impressive stats, but he is as stable a

Believe it or not, there are rays
of hope during this tumultuous l-4
Pitt Panther football season;

Those rays emanate from this
year’s crop of freshmen, who are
beginning to make significant con-
tributions to the team. While many
of thesefreshmen weren’t thought
to immediately help their first year,
injuries and depth problems have
forced Coach Johnny Majors to
rely more on these players.

The most intriguing freshman
this year has been quarterback
Tony Zimmerman. During mini-
camp, the coaches believed that
Zimmerman would redshirt this
season as he learned Coach Majors’
offensive schemes.

But the unspectacular play of
incumbent starter Matt Lytle and
his replacement Pete Gonzalez
caused Majors to briefly play
Zimmerman for the last two series
against Miami, thus forfeiting his
redshirt.

Zimmerman had an inauspi-
cious debut for the Panthers, fum-
bling his first.two possessions

 

An in-dpth Iok 1‘ PH

while misfiring on all four of his
passes. He should be able to shake
off his first—game jitters but, sur-
prisingly, he is not penciled in as
the starting quarterback against
Temple this weekend.

Although Zimmerman is the.

future leader of the Panther
offense, the Pitt coaches obviously
feel is he not prepared to start.
Leading the freshman defensive
barrage is behemoth defensive line-
man Demond Gibson. Gibson, a 6-
foot-4, 300-pound true freshman
from Penn Hills, is leading the

-Panthers with two sacks. Gibson
has started the last four games,
compiling 10 tackles — two for

losses. Gibson has been around the
ball constantly and has effectively
plugged the" defensive holes.

Two other freshmen are provid-
ing unexpected defensive help.
Scrappy Seth Hornack has provided
valuable depth at free safety, where
he’s played in dime coverage.
Hornack is diminutive in size (list-
ed as 5-foot-10), but is a hard hit-

Men's soccer continues non-conference mastery with

?l(§\Ipin'|.i||6)', M,‘    ,, W,/,,
, .  

 

Sandwiched between two far—off
Big East away games, the Pitt soccer
team took time Wednesday to stake out
their home turf.

Earlier this season, the Panthers
took out Duquesne 1-0 and last night,
goals from Keith Hoetzlein and Mike
Dyer were enough for a 2-1 victory
over the other local soccer power,

I Robert Morris.

T “This is a big game for us,” said
Dyer, who scored the game—winner
midway through _ the second half.
“They’re traditionally very good. [This
was] for the bragging rights in the city.”

The non—conference win is the third
this season for the Panthers (3-4-1), and
comes after a loss at Big East power St.
J ohn’s last weekend. The team will go
back on the road this Saturday, travel-
ling to Georgetown in search of their
first Big East victory.

Pitt’s first real scoring chance

against the Colonials came 20 minutes.

into the first half, when Dyer’s comer
kick was pressed toward the Robert
Morris goal by Josh Brooks. Brooks
passed to an open Hoetzlein, who
deﬂected the ball into the net for the
game’s first goal.

“I think he kind of caught Keith
off—guard,” said Dyer. “Josh passed it in
to Keith, and it went off his gut and
went in.” ' .

The inadvertent score was
Hoetz1ein’s third of the season, good for
the team lead. The Panther star. broke a
three-way tie with Drew Kopp and
Dean Astorino, who now share second
with two goals each.

Minutes after the deﬂection, it was
the Colonials’ turn to catch a break. The
referee whistled a penalty on Pitt’s
Brett Stezoski and ordered a penalty
kick, which was smashed past goalie
Adam Spitzer to tie the score.

“There’s no way that was a foul,”
said Dyer, who, along with the rest of
his teammates, saw. no wrongdoing on
the play by Stezoski. “I think the ref
knew it. The ref gave it to them.”

The score stayed tied well into the

second, with both teams staying at a
stalemate near midﬁeld. Spitzer was not
pressed during the contest, and most of
Pitt’s -attempts to break the Colonial
defense were also unsuccessful.

Finally, a pass from Kopp to Dyer
made it through the Robert Morris line.
Dyer dodged the sole remaining
Colonial defender, then sunk the shot
for his first goal of the season.

“Drew put me through, I dribbled a
bit, and the goalie guessed wrong,” said
Dyer. “Nobody got the better of the
play; we just put it away at the end.”

The win was the first for the
Panthers in nearly a month, dating back
to a 2-1 victory over SUNY-Buffalo on
Sept. 4.

Phil Matilla and the
rest of the Pitt men's
soccer team enjoyed its
first win in nearly a
month after they beat
cross-town power
Robert Morris,

2- 1, yesterday.

Pitt plays this Saturday
at conference-rival
Georgetown.

been lacking for the Panthers this
year. With junior Ernest Coakley
sidelined for at least the Temple
game with a knee injury, expect
freshman Nathan Kirby to see more
playing time. Kirby has registered
nine tackles in the last three games
as a substitute.

Offensively, right guard Brian
Minehart has been the only fresh-
man to start, but he is certainly not
the only contributor. Minehart, a
monstrous 6—foot-5 and 285
pounds, has started the last two
games for the injured Jeff Craig.

Running back LaFann Williams
has also added to the Panther
offense. Williams was a pleasant
surprise against Miami last week,

NHL

last year’s team
assists (50).

With Calder Trophy candidate
Jarome Ingila and a slew of other
youngsters including winger Corey
Stillman and defensive enforcer Todd
Simpson, Calgary will get tougher
with time.

6. Los Angeles Kings (24-40-8, 6th)

GM Sam McMaster went out and
made a few offseason additions that
should keep the Kings out of last
place.

Los Angeles acquired veteran
journeyman Ed Olczyk to bolster a
sluggish ‘95—’96 offensive squad.
Olczyk looks to have gotten his sec-
ond wind after posting 49 points in
Winnipeg last season, his best outing
in over four years. He should help for-
ward Dmiri Kristich and a squad des-
perately 'in need‘ of scoring.

The man who will almost single-
handedly keep Los Angeles out of last
place is goaltender Stephane Fiset.
Fiset backed up Patrick Roy for the
second half of last season, posting 22
wins in 37 games. .

7. San Jose Sharks (20-55-12, 7th)‘

The Sharks are just hurting in
every department. First-year Head
Coach Al Sims is in for a long season.

Offensively, San Jose picked up
free agent Bernie Nicholls over the
summer. Nicholls, 35, finished last
season with 60 points in 59 games.
However, he has missed 93 games in
his last three seasons due to injuries
and is not the man to count on.

Additionally, the Sharks are hold-
ing their breath with the acquisition of
defenseman Al Iafrate. Iafrate, 30, is
billed as San Jose’s top blueliner
despite not having played in two
years.

With every preview comes predic-

-tions: Colorado over Philadelphia in
five games for the 1996-97 Stanley
Cup.

leading the Panthers with 55 yards
in only five carries. Along with
standout tailback Billy West and
key reserve Dwayne Schulters,
Williams provides the Panthers
with unusual depth at running back.

Elusive kick returner Hank
Poteat has also emerged as a threat
for the Panthers. Poteat had five
kick returns against the Hurricanes,
including a 46—yarder. A converted

running back, Poteat has also been

used at cornerback in an effort to
bolster a decimated secondary.
Collectively, these freshmen
are beginning to have an "impact on
the 1996 team. As they mature,
they will hopefully become the cor-
nerstones of future Pitt teams.

Temple

runner as Temple has had since the Paul
Palmer days. Lee is the goalline expert.
He leads the team with ﬁve touch-
downs, all coming in the first two
games, and has yet to lose yardage on a
carry all season.

The game against Pitt opens the Big
East slate for the Owls, whose only con-
ference win (1-31 since 1991) was last
season’s win over the Panthers. After
Dickerson called his team “overconf1-
dent” in a loss to Bowling Green, they
got stomped by Penn State 41-0.

Temple, much like Pitt, hopes to put
the early season behind them.

“We are going to put the non—con—
ference games in the past,” Dickerson
said. “The Pitt game will mark the
opening of a new season for us.”

of the basketball season,” Cochran
said.

Speed, however, is a large con-
sideration considering that Jaynes is
only staying on as AD until he finds a
new position at another university or
Pitt finds his replacement. Jaynes is
rumored to be interested in the AD
position at the University of Idaho.
Idaho held a press conference yester-
day, announcing their desire to hire
Jaynes, who has not said how quickly
he’ll leave Pitt.

Cochran denied rumors that
Jaynes has attended his last official
meeting at Pitt. He also did not con-

I sider Jaynes a lame duck AD.

duck,” Cochran said. “[Jaynes] is still
in that position [as AD.]”

This is certainly a difficult time
for a candidate to step into the
Panther AD position. With a football
team that is $4 million in debt in the
midst of their eighth straight losing
season and a struggling basketball
team, it is imperative that the
University hires a competent AD.

Andy Urbanik, Florida State
University’s assistant AD, and Tom
Beckett from Yale University are both
rumored to be in contention for the
position. In order to effectively exam-
ine these candidates as well as others,
the search committee needs to act
rapidly.

son motivation, Pitt had to look no
farther than their first game —-— against
Notre Dame.

“That was the best thing for us,”
Bonnsate said. “All summer long
while we were lifting weights and get-
ting in shape, we thought just one
thing — Notre Dame.”

In that game, Notre Dame took the
opening kick-off and drove down the
field and scored a touchdown.

“It was like getting’ sucker-
punched in the stomach,” said
Bonnsate. “But then, we get the ball
and Tony takes a pitch on our second
play and goes 81 yards and we didn’t
look back after that. We pounded
Notre Dame for the rest of the game

and went on to win the champi-
onship.”

Bonnsate was injured in that game
and hobbled off on crutches. While
making his way to the locker room, he
was pelted with oranges, ice and soda
cans. He was not bothered because he
only felt joy. Pitt was it, and as he
looked up at the scoreboard tears
came from his eyes. Pitt 34, Notre
Dame 10.

“It was special to me because I
was the only one that was there to
remember 1-10 and now, we were

champs,” said Bonnsate.

The season culminated in a Sugar
Bowl victory over Georgia and Pitt’s
ninth national championship.
