natory conduct,” the complaint states.

Johnston was never charged as a result of
the FBI investigation. Adam Stuart Busby, of
Dublin, was charged in August 2012 in con-
nection with the threats.

Johnston believes the evidence for the
claim lies in University records, but will not
be released until during the discovery pro-

cess in the case. He declined to give further _

details.

He is demanding compensation for the
scholarship and potential earnings he lost
as a result of his expulsion, as well as for
emotional suffering and punitive damages.

Pitt Vice Chancellor for Communications
Ken Service said that as of Monday evening,
Pitt had not received a copy of the complaint.

“We intend to vigorously defend any
claims related to this case,” he said in an
email.

The complaint describes Johnston’s last
semester at Pitt—Johnstown, during which
he butted heads with campus police and ad-

ministrators over his use of male-gendered

facilities.

Johnston said that he listed his sex as fe-
male (his biological sex) when he applied to
Pitt—Johnstown in order to avoid any confu-
sion that would interfere with his admission.
He received a full scholarship, and lived.as a
man for the whole time he attended classes
there.

This decision to live as a man included
the use of the men’s locker room while he
took a weight-training course in the spring
semester of 2011.

In the fall of 2011, he produced a nota-
rized document in order to have his name
ofﬁcially changed in the school’s records.
He was taking aweight—training course that
semester, again using the men’s locker room.

In September, an administrator asked
him to meet with her. At the meeting, she
told Johnston he could no longer use the
men’s facilities. .

“Because using the female locker rooms
was not a realistic option for him, Mr. John-
ston agreed to the temporary use of a unisex

locker room at the Sports Center normally
reserved for referees,” the complaint says.

According to the complaint, Johnston
is not aware of any other student who was
required to use this locker room.

Johnston complained in emails to several
senior administrators about his exclusion
from the men’s locker room. An administra-

tor responded by telling him that he could _

only use the locker room ifhe received acourt
order or had his sex legally changed on his
birth certiﬁcate.

Johnston sent a response to the adminis-
trator that he planned to use the men’s locker
room, and said his letter should be consid-
ered a formal complaint of harassment.

He continued to use the locker room until
mid-November, when an article about his dis-
pute with the administration was published
in The Advocate, Pitt-Johnstown’s student
newspaper.

After the publication of the article, cam-
pus police issuedJohnston two citations for
disorderly conduct asJohnston tried to use

~ the locker room on separate occasions.

Although both citations were later with-
drawn,Johnston was summoned to a Student
Code of Conduct hearing that took place in
early December. He was declared “persona

Board’s Alcohol Education Grant Program,
which has given more than $10 million to
various organizations "since the program
began in 1999.

« “The Liquor Control Board isn’t just in
the business of selling alcohol -- its job is
also to promote responsible alcohol use for

' those 21 and older,” Frankel said.

Earlier this month, the agency an-
nounced that it will issue 61 grants this

V‘ ' .; year totaling $2.14’ million as part of the

tually summoned for another disciplinary
hearing. InJanuary 2012, helwas expelled.

He was also charged  indecent ex-
posure, criminal trespass and disorderly
conduct in a Pennsylvania court and pleaded
guilty to reduced charges of disorderly con-
duct and trespass earlier this year. A

Johnston lost his scholarship when he
could not attend Pitt—Johnstown in the spring
of 2012. 

His complaint alleges that Pitt wrongly
recorded his sex as female in its records
and failed to update them. According to
the complaint, Pitt should have updated its
records when he presented evidence that
he should have been listed as male in his
student records. He alleges that this makes

‘ Pitt responsible for his expulsion.

He also says that he told administrators

that no member of the University had pointed A

to a speciﬁc policy that said he could not use

the men’s locker room. The complaint also

alleges that a senior administrator incited

police to interfere withJohnston’s use of the j

facilities, whichjohnston needed in order to
complete his class. Finally, he claims that Pitt
violated its own policy of nondiscrimination‘
by not allowing himto use facilities desig-
nated for the sex with which he identiﬁes. ‘
Johnston said that he is still looking for
legal representation, but wrote and ﬁled the
suit on his own béhalfbecause he wanted to

program. The funds will go to nonproﬁts,
communities, law-enforcement programs,
institutions of higher education and other
organizations.

According to statistics from the Board,
48 percent of reported alcohol use by col-
lege students in the state is by underage
individuals. Yet students noted in the re-
port that when police stop a party, partici-
pants are_ sent home with minimal, if any,
punishment. J

The CMU Police Department will receive
a grant totaling $30,000, while the grant
for the Oakland Planning and Development
‘Corporation will amount to $40,000. Both
of these grants will be disbursed over a
two-year period, and the organizations that
receive them will be responsible for keep-
ing the Liquor Control Board updated on
progress at the time of each disbursement.

At the press conference, Sgt.Jason_ Hen-
dershot of the CMU Police Department said
that 40 percent of the grant will go toward
the departrnent’s alcohol-education pro-
gram, including Realize Alcohol Inﬂuences
Decision-making -— a’ week-long educa-
tional resource for incoming freshmen.

An equal amount willbe spent targeting

problems with largeparties and “dangerous
drinking.”-The remaining 20 percent will be
spent on staff training on underage drink-

ing recognition and appropriately dealing _

with such drinking in Oakland.

Corporation, said during the press confer-
ence that the organization plans to spend
its grant on hiring off—duty police officers
to enforce codes that prevent underage
drinking and to hire part-time staff mem-
bers to educate students and landlords in
the neighborhood.

“Oakland is a diverse neighborhood
with wonderful attributes beyond the im-
age of a party neighborhood. Like neigh-
borhoods everywhere, we have families
who take pride in their homes, walk chil-
dren to school bus stops, and take action
about issues of concern,” Wilson said.

Wilson said that although the organiza-
tion will work with residents and with Pitt
police to curb underage drinking, students
will have to help.

One South Oakland resident was
pleased with Frankel’s announcement.

“I think that this is a deﬁnite step in

the right direction to control the underage .

since he graduated from Pitt in 1978, said.

While the -grants are aimed at least
partly at addressing the behavior of Pitt
students living in South Oakland, Pitt Vice

efforts to curb underage drinking among

the student population.

He said that Pitt police and city po-
lice have already coordinated with one
another to combat alcohol violatiolis in
Oakland and have stepped up patrols in
the neighborhood.  .,

At the beginning of this semester, Pitt
released a guide aimed at teaching students
to be good neighbors. Service described

 
 
  
    
   
  

neighbors who are older than they are
and don’t want to be affected by raging
parties every weekend.

Frankel left immediately after the press
conference concluded, before he could
answer additionalquestions. i

The Oakland Planningand Develop-

ment ‘Corporation will coordinate with

Oakwatch, which consists of residents

of Oakland who try to control underage .

drinking and reckless behavior by giving
citations and talking to landlords about
the residents living in their properties.

Becker described the group as a “tool

that has as many members as there are
residents that live in Oakland, allied with
major institutions directly responsible for
building, zoning, parking and liquor.”
V Becker said during the press confer-
ence that Oakwatch’s in partnering with
the Oakland Planning and Development
Corporation is to educate underage stu-
dents about the dangers of drinking, so
that this won’t be such a problem when
they are older.

Student Government Board President
Gordon Louderback said that investing
money in law enforcement and education
efforts in communities with large numbers

of college students is a logical way to curb -

underage drinking across the state.

He saw the Oakland Planning and De-
velopment Corporation’s code-enforce-
ment and education efforts as part of a
broader effort to maintain good order in
Oakland.

“I think it’s a collaborative effort to keep
our students safe,” Louderback said. I

Corporatism in higher education is
prominent, unbreakable

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

Universities across the country
often trumpet positions held by
distinguished alumni in corpo-
rate America, telling students
that recruiters from these com-
panies flock to these schools

searching for new, fresh talent. *

But t-hey’re only telling you
half of the story. i

Corporations are no longer
just looking to universities
for intelligent potential em-
ployees, but for alcontinuing,
steady relationship with a prof-
itable demographic.

Yet, even though corpora-

tions are marketing where we
eat, study and sleep, we tend
not to really notice until they’re
gone. Personally, when I ﬁrst

returned to campus this semes-
ter and noticed that the Taco
Bell under Towers was miss-
ing, I almost had a panic attack.
Fortunately, I found that I could
still get my fill of Crunchwrap
Supremes, which I had come
to know and love last year, at
the Union.

Most students can relate to
this because one’s own personal
loyalty to a product is just a
huge part of the college expe-
rience nowadays. Just imagine
if Chipotle closed its doors or
if Dunkin’ Donuts shut down.
If you happen to be a fan of ei-
ther, you would be devastated.
Qdoba or Starbucks wouldn’t
compare for some of us.

This is the kind of loyalty
corporations are trying to con-
dition among college students,

and it is becoming clear that
the increasing commercializa-
tion of the college campus is
clearly working. College stu-
dents spend about $46 billion
on consumer purchases every
year — which, to no one’s sur-
prise, includes products from
the aforementioned corpora-
tions.

This could be partly due to
the fact that name-brand prod-
ucts are literally all around us.

. But corporate sponsorship has

been instilled in us since we
arrived. If you can recall, it’s
a part of -ourwPitt orientation
process. ‘

an easy marketing opportunity by holding an all—night

has become a huge part of the weekfor incoming

Mark Britton, a chief executive at the Mr. Youth mar-
keting agency, describes this strategy as, “market—
ing through the students, rather than marketing to
students.” Essentially, the idea is that there will be
more trust in a product if it is advertised through a

BEER CGLUMN

Inside craft beer’s controversial contract-brewing debate

Jackson Crowder
Staﬁ" Wrz'ter

Fresh and local. These are ideas
that everyone, in some way or
another, can get behind. It feels
good to go into a store and, in
my case, buy a six pack or two
that was brewed right here in
Pittsburgh. It makes me feel
like I’m supporting my adop-
tive community, putting the
few dollars I have back into our
economy and helping to give
Penn Brewery, Full Pint, East
End or Church Brew Works a
piece of the pie. It was not al-
ways that way. Perhaps growing
up in my hometown of Washing-
ton, D.C., a city without much of
an identity and precious little
to call its own, made me that

way — but I digress. My journey
to becoming a beer enthusiast
led me to appreciate locality,
particularly as it relates to the
brewing industry. The idea of
drinking something that was
brewed only weeks before and
just miles from my apartment
was a titillating one. Titillat-
ing but not always realistic. Not
always realistic and not always
necessary or even beneﬁcial.
Though Pittsburgh’s prized
microbrews have yet to be
touched by it, the practice of
contract brewing has recently
gained attention in brewing
circles. Contract brewing is
exactly what it sounds like: A
brewery does not have enough
space, manpower or money to
brew its own beer, so it con-

tracts another brewery to do it

- for them. It reads like cheating

and, in a certain sense, it sort of
is. If a brewery does not make
its own beer, a process that is

nothing short of art when done

correctly, how can it justify put-
ting its label on the bottle? This
one fundamental flaw aside,
contract brewing has taken on a
negative stigma within the beer
community — one that it does
not deserve.

Breweries are expensive to
build. Breweries are expensive
to maintain. Breweries are ex:
pensive to staff. Breweries, if

they want any hope of success, .

have to pay for distribution.

Providing the drinking public

with a quality beer is not an

easy process for those on a tight

. vtoeNPR»’l"l

budget. And although contract
brewing might not be the most
honorable solution in the eyes
of some, it works. Matt Katase
of Pittsburgh’s newest beer
outfit — The Brew Gentlemen
Beer Co. —— said, “I see [contract
brewing’s] value  I’ve seen it
work and I’ve seen a lot of peo-
ple do it successfully.”

One such example of a con-
tract brewing success story is
none other than The Boston
Beer Company, better known

. to you and me ass-amuel Adams.. .

Sam Adams —. which, according
Bill Chappell, reported
net earnings of "$181.3 million in
the second quarter of this year
— started outicontracting the

S brewing rights for its legend- g_

ary Boston Lagertoenone other

than The Pittsburgh Brewing
Company, famous (infamous?)
purveyors of Iron City.

Right or wrong, Sam Adams
is seen by many as the quint-
essential success story of the
American microbrew. Today,
though, the debate over wheth-
er or not Sam Adams is still a
“microbrew” rages in the craft
brewing community. Those
earnings are deﬁnitely not em-
blematic of craft ﬁnances, but

. who are we to throw stones at a

good business plan? No matter
which side of the debate, one

~ comes down on, Sam Adams has

played and continues toplay

a crucial role in the world of

Americanbeer. No Sam Adams

TV’s next great
anti-hero
has arrived

Andrew Fishman
1' Stqff H/rz'ter

It’s Sunday night. Almost 3 million fans
around the country are about to tune in
to cult TV show “Breaking Bad” on AMC.
I am not one of these 3 million people.
To the shock of some and the horror of
others, I can honestly say I have never
seen an episode of this show. I
When I tell people this, one of two
things happens: I either get scoffed
at, or I get a heartfelt lecture on why I
should be watching it. To be fair, I really
don’t have anything against “Breaking
Bad.” I don’t have a legitimate reason to
dislike it. Yet I ﬁnd myself disliking it,
anyway. I don’t want to label myself as
the quasi-hipsterjournalist ofthe tele-
vision world, but somehow every time
I get another lecture on why I should
watch “Breaking Bad,” it makes me less
inclined tojump on in. I’m sure the hype
is well deserved, but when it comes to
drawing me in, it’s a definite turnoff.
I’ve never been the type to jump on the
bandwagon, and every recommenda-
tion I get reaffirms my feelings on the
subject.
I’ve had my own Sunday—night rou-
tine for the past few weeks. I tune in
to Showtime and watch the network’s
drama “Ray Donovan.” Never heard of
it? Well my dad and I —— and almost 1.5
million nonconformist television view-
ers —— watched its pilot episode this

The Gaslight Anthem has entered a new
phase in its career.

With four full-length albums under its
belt, coupled with a large and growing

June, making it the biggest premiere
Showtime has ever aired.

Though the show lacks crystal meth
deals and the dad from “Malcolm in the
M°“1C\\e.” it makes up by having its own
P19th0l‘a of action and sex and a phe-
nomenal cast, highlighted by Liev sch-
‘reiber’s (Ray) andjon Voight‘s (Mickey,
Ray’s father) performances. ‘

fan base, The Gaslight Anthem can no
longer be looked at as a heartland rock
revivalist group. After their performance
Thursday night at Mr. Small’s Theatre in
Millvale, it is clear that they have started
paving their own way.
Dressed in a Sun Records T—shirt and
a jean jacket, lead singer Brian Fallon
took the stage as an older and wiser mu-
Sician than he did in years past. Suc-

Gaslight Anthem shows their age in Pittsburgh

On Thursday night, Brian Fallon let his guitar do the talking as The Gaslig nthem trthouh its isetlist. Andy Slpman

band’s frontman was both nostalgic and
a tad reserved. The crowd hung on his
words, but he didn’t spout life lessons.
He simply talked about the differences
between playing music now and when
he was young.

The set was a constant stream of
songs from their discography, played
one after another with no breaks. Some
of the songs began to mesh together, but
the band’s dedication to play as much as
possible given their allotted time was
admirable. The band —— which has added
a third guitar player to the mix — played
many of their Newjersey-influenced an-
thems about girls, growing up and the
hardships of life in the city.

For the members of the The Gaslight

 

Anthem, who grew up during a period
when the punk scene lacked the sub-
stance of its predecessors, the new feel
was palpable. Fallon — a musician who
lived through that musical whirlwind
and has plenty of tattoos and grit to
prove it — seemed less like a misan-
thropic musician and more like a wise
rock ’n’ roller. He was quick to silence
hecklers and wore a. grave face when
singing the hooks of slower songs.

The crowd that night displayed
the different factions of fans that The
Gaslight Anthem has reached over the
years. There was the older, beer-drink-
ing crowd, pressed together in -the back

HSHMAN  

a quote of his own from episode nine of
the series: “Ifyou need a gun or a car in
this town, I’m the guy you want to get it
for ya.” Fictional Los Angeles law firm
Goldman and Drexler, which represents
high—prof1le celebrities, employs Ray as
a hitman. When Ray’s father is released
from prison, the FBI uses him to‘try to
finally nip Ray and his superiors for
years of under—the—table lawlessness.

The show also deals with Ray’s home
life, including the deteriorating mar-
riage between him and his wife, as
well as his relationship with histwo
high—school-aged kids, who have their
own struggles with their father’s line
of "work. The show hinges on a clearly
failed father—son relationship between
Ray and Mickey that delves way back
into both of their pasts.

An accolade that “Breaking Bad” of-

" ten receives holds true to “Ray Dono-

van” as well; Ray is a bad man. But his
pure badassery and intelligence cause
his viewers to still find themselves
rooting for him. When it comes to pure
de’s‘pi‘cable behavior, Donovan fits“ in
among the top tier of sinister heroes.
He uses under—the—table deals and mur-
ders to take down his own family. Yet

through it all, he stays likeable. It may

sound surprising, but after one episode,
viewers will find it hard not to side with
Ray. With “Breaking Bad” coming to
an end in a few weeks, perhaps Walt is
passing the torch to a new era of lead
Scoundrel.

The show itself doesn’t hold back on
any front. The fact that it airs on Show-
time allows it to take the action (and
often violence) to a level far higher than

‘what is acceptable on basic cable — not
to mention the fact that it’s commercial
free. This action adds to the appeal and
suspense that has kept a consistent 1.5
million viewers tuned in every week.

Though the season ﬁnale is only two
weeks away. (I have the date marked off
on my calendar), Showtime has already
announced the renewal of Ray Donovan
for a second season in 2014.

I like to say that I found the diamond
in the rough with “Ray Donovan.” The
topic of television shows has become
an active one, and I love bringing up

 

Ray among all the Walter Whites and
Don Drapers.

In the age of binge-watching televi-
sion shows on Netflix and the like, Ray
Donovan should be at the top of every-
one’s list for what to watch next. So get
online, queueit up and embrace the
next generation of television reprobate.

watching the performance, and there
was also the rowdy, high-energy mosh-
ers, who were more apt to pump their
ﬁsts to the lyrics of their favorite songs.
To the delight of all, the band played a
majority of its most memorable tunes,
including “American Slang” and “Great
Expectations.” ’ p
The band behind "Fallon had under-
gone a similar transformation — trad-

_ing in some of the energyfor moreof a

and technical difficulties. The longest
preparation was the 10 seconds that
Fallon needed to put alcapdon his Les
Paul Classic. Moreover, no one switched
instruments or wasted time with exces-
sive tuning and sound checks.

The fast-paced nature of the show and
the even-keeled band could have rubbed
‘a few fans the wrong way. What some
might have perceived as a seasoned band
playing through another show could
have seemed to others to be an apathetic
performance. Also, with such relentless
pacings, it was understandable for some
to get bored — especially if some of the
songs were unfamiliar.

would almost certainly mean no Stone
Brewing, no Sierra Nevada Brewing, no
Three Floyds Brewing, nor any of our
othernational beer treasures. In this
context, one comes to see contract brew-
ing in a different light. Without it, Ameri-
can beer might still be very dull and,
furthermore, a national shame.
Though uncommon,*contract brew-
ing is still practiced today. This is out
of necessity, however, not laziness.
Space, or a lack thereof, seems to be a
common denominator in the need for
contract brewing. Having been on too
many brewery tours to count, I can say

- with confidence that breweries are not

exactly space,-efficient enterprises. Thus,
it is completely un- V ’

numerous attempts to break into the
craft scene, a new microbrew has to look
the part in order to gain respect. They
have to look homespun — not too pol-
ished and not too professional.

For a startup trying to break into the
expensive and competitive world of mi-
crobrewed beer, contract brewing can
be the perfect way to cultivate an iden-
tity and test the water before having to
fork over the cash for their own space.
Ashley Routson of CraftBeer.com wrote,
“Rather than having the usual revenue
expenses associated with owning a busi-
ness ——- rent, lease on forklift, loans on
brewing machinery, payroll for a large
staff .— contract brewers use their capital
for additional brand building and mar-
keting activities to yield a higher return
on investment.” V

contract brewing isn’t ubiquitous.
Thanks to a kickstarter campaign, The
Brew Gentlemen never had to contract

out their recipes. “We had the plan to - -

build our own brewery from the start,”
says Katase. “Also, we’re going for a
very small system, so we’re not look-
ing to pump out giant amounts of vol-
ume.” Would contracting its brews have
helped The Brew Gentlemen break into
a crowded beer market? It’s‘ certainly
possible. Either way, it is still too early to
say for certain, because the brewery will
not officially open until later this year.
In today’s craft beer market, image is

craft brew consumers can smell a macro.

has done harm. Sure, it might muddy the

as long as good beer is readily available,

beer purists have made it out to be, Ka-
tase responded emphatically, saying “No!
It’s a different route.” Contract brewing

beer industry, and —- living in the golden

Chryst sees improvement after team's week-three win

.r;ar:>>Q§,§;’-$1:-;-:

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst made his weekly
media address Monday at noon as the Pan-
thers began preparation for their second
Atlantic Coast Conference game — their
ﬁrst road matchup of the season at Duke.
“We’re looking forward to this week, a
normal game week of preparation,” Chryst

said. “We’re getting back into ACC play and _

going on the road for the ﬁrst time.” _
This week is the ﬁrst during which Pitt
plays games on back-to-back weekends,
after the Panthers had a bye week follow-
ing their Labor Day opener against Florida
State. Chryst hopes this week will allow the C

program to get into the ‘swing of the season. 

“The way things are laid. out, you em-
brace it. It’s the greatest thing for this
team,” Chryst said. “But it is good to get
into a rhythm.” ’ n ’

' ‘ ‘Primarily, the Panthers’ mastery of fun-
darrientals appeared imprpved against the

Lobos — something Chryst looks to carry»

over into this weekend.
“I thought we did a better job of tackling,”
Chryst said. “The ﬁrst half in particular, we

did a really good job on defense of being dis— '

ciplined with our assignments. When we had
opportunities to tackle, we tackled better.”

One area in which‘ the Panthers need
to continue improving, though, is on the
offensive side of the ball. Although Pitt’s
numbers were substantially better in its
second game than its ﬁrst, there were still
areas of concern — namely turnovers.

“Offensively, we were on edge early, but
I thought we did a better job as the game
went on,” Chryst said. '

For Chryst, the ﬁx revolves around a fo-
cus on the fundamentals. r ’

“That’s the message all the time: You get
better by getting better at your technique
and fundamentals,” Chryst said. “You never
get bored coaching those, and players can’t
ever get bored working on those.”

BARNES BURNER

There’s not all that much to take away from Pitt’s latest victory

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt head football coach Paul Chryst is
already off to a better start in his second
year as a byproduct of the Panthers’ 49-
27 Victory over New Mexico on Saturday.
This contrasts Chryst’s first year, in
which Pitt suffered a 31-17 home-opener

r loss to Youngstown State followed by a

34-10 loss in Cincinnati the next week.

- 9. L So Pitt is 1-1 through two games, back

"“57° -500,. and showing improvements
across the’\’-guard‘, Got it

Le“ not get ahead of ourselves.

Pitt took care of businessin the win
over New Mexico. The most important
aspect of the victory was that Pitt man-
aged‘ to win a game it was supposed to
win —— a point of order they haven’t

necessarily followed through with in
recent years. M

But after two weeks, there’s no way
to get a definitive read on this Panthers
team quite yet. One would like to think
Pitt isn’t'so bad that it will lose by more
than 20 pointsevery week, as it did to
Florida State in week one, but they are
not so dominant that they will win by
22 points each week, as it did Saturday.

That’s not to say there weren’t posi-
tives to take out of Saturday’s win, be-
cause there certainly were. Freshman
receiver Tyler Boyd followed up his
impressive debut against Florida State
with an even more impressive game

.. against the Lobos, racking up 195 all-

’P\1‘l“Pose yards and two scores.
B°Yd’S‘Pérformance earned him the
_ CllStlI'lCtl0n of ACC Receiver of the week

and 247Sports’ True Freshman of the
Week. C .

The Panthers dominated the line
of scrimmage on offense, with Pitt’s
offensive line allowing only a single
sack and opening wide lanes forjames
Conner and Isaac Bennett out of the
backfield. Conner rushed 12 times for
119 yards and two scores, while Bennett
also topped 100 yards on 14 carries and
scored twice.

Overall, the Panthers’ ground game
racked up 288 total yards after Pitt’s
running backs combined for 72 yards
against Florida State. '

Redshirt senior quarterback Torn
Savage worried Pitt fans with his early
interception, but he rebounded on his
very next pass when he hit Boyd inside

the hash marks for a 51-yard gain that A

 

set up a four-yard scoring toss to Scott
Orndoff. V
Redshirt senior ‘receiver Devin
Street had a solid game, as well, with
ﬁve catches for 80 yards. Street moved
into third place among all Pitt receivers
in terms of receptions with his perfor-
mance Saturday. -
Defensively, Pitt stiﬂed the Lobos
through the entire game. New Mexico
eventually logged 270 yards of offense
and 27 points, but most of that came in
the second half against a Pitt defense
consisting primarily of substitutes.

Eagles running back,

Sean Corrado
Stﬁ Wrz'ter

Although their respective teams couldn’t say
the same, a number of former Pitt players in
the NFL registered solid performances in the
league’s second week of action.

Eagles running back LeSean McCoy (Pitt
2007-2008) dominated yet again Sunday
afternoon, as he tallied a career-high 114
receiving yards on ﬁve receptions in a 33-
30 last-second loss to San Diego. With the
ability to catch the ball out of the backﬁeld,
McCoy has become an integral component
of Chip Kel1y’s new high—speed offense in
Philadelphia.

McCoy also took 11 carries for 53 yards.

McCoy, through two weeks of the season,
leads the league with 237 rushing yards and
14 ﬁrst downs. He will look to add to his
leading totals against his former coach, Andy
Reid, when the Eagles host Kansas City on
Thursday night.

Tampa Bay cornerback Darrelle Revis
(Pitt 2004-2006) had four solo tackles and
a pass defended in a 16-14 loss to New Or-
leans. Revis was able to hold Saints receiver
Marques Colston to 63 yards, but the rest
of the Tampa Bay defense could not ﬁnd an
answer for tight end Jimmy Graham, who
chalked up 179 receiving yards and the only
New Orleans touchdown.

Cleveland defensive end Jabaal Sheard
(Pitt 2007-2010) recorded eight tackles, half
of a sack and a pass defended against the
division-rival Baltimore Ravens. The Browns
fell 14-6 as the Cleveland offense struggled
to move down the ﬁeld.

Giants fullback Henry Hynoski (Pitt
2007-010) provided a strong lead block that

   
  

Sunday. MCT Campus

allowed running back Brandon Jacobs to
push his way across the goal line. The Giants
came up short in a41-23 loss to the Broncos.

San Francisco punter Andy Lee (Pitt
2000-2004) saw a lot of action in a 29-3
blowout loss to the Seahawks. Lee averaged
49 yards over four punts but was unable to
pin Seattle inside its own 20-yard line a single

Pitt grad McCoy shines in loss

Eagles running back Lesean Mccoy had a standout performance for the Philadelphia Eagles in their loss to San Diego

time.

Though many former Panthers put in
solid performances this weekend, one in par-
ticular struggled to live up to expectations.

Arizona wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald
(Pitt 2002-2003), who caught two touch-
downs last week for the Cardinals, managed
to haul in only two passes for 33 yards. His

Cardinals still beat the Lions, 25-21.

Fitzgerald, who was listed as questionable
on the injury report, was unable to ﬁnish the
contest due to a hamstring injury that has
been bothering him allweek. He is optimistic
that he will play in week three against the
Saints, but he will be very limited in practice
this week. I

At quarterback, Chryst expressed conﬁdence
. in starting quarterback To Savage, despite
the two interceptions the redshirt senior
threw against New Mexico.
“There’s always

bit.” —

As Chryst continues to instill the funda-
mentals in his players, the Panthers prepare
themselves for Duke. The Blue Devils will
represent the closest team Pitt has played

’ in terms of talent level, as the Devils were

predicted in the preseason to ﬁnish sixth in
the ACC Coastal Division behind Pitt in ﬁfth.

times for 119 yards and two scores, but he

Lobos recovered. I ‘ —
“I thought both Isaac [Bennett] and

James had moments where they ran ex-

said. “Both of them need to clean up some

And on an everlpositive note, Chryst

healthy.

“Right now —- knock on wood — we’re

good one for Pitt,‘ and he is listed as
the starter for Pitt’s game against Duke
this weekend. ‘ '

Of all defenders, senior defensive tackle

Aaron Donald stood out the most. He
was in the backfield seemingly on every
play, and he ended up with two sacks,
two other tackles for losses and five
total tackles.

Although it was nice to see Pitt domi-
nate a team, it won’t be like this every

week. Pitt turned the ball over multiple
times, which isn’t dangerous against a
team like New Mexico but could turn
into 20 or more points for a more prom-
ising opponent. ,
The matchup with Duke Saturday
should be the best litmus test for the
2013 Pitt team. Duke was one of two
teams voted tolﬁnish below Pitt in the
ACC’s Coastal Division. If Pitt is going
to end up somewhere between the dif-
ferent versions of itself against Florida
State and New Mexico, "playing a team

like Duke is the best place to start when ~

looking to understand this team. 3
