sy Griffith, C40, will also speak.

Weather permitting, the spectators
will be assembled on canvas laid on

 Chancellor Declines
Smoker Invitation,
I
‘Chancellor John G-. Bowman’s letter
to Albert. F. Randolph, chairman of
the Homecoming Smoker committee:
September 28, 1939.
Dear Mr. Randolph:
Let me thank you for your kind
, invitation to be present at the an-
I nual. Homecoming Smoker on the
2 evening of October 13.
, Some of the alumni who will be
present on that occasion will be in
accord with the present athletic
; policy of the University, and some
5 will not be of that mind. It may be
that my presence there would make
for controversy and that would not
be helpful. The Smoker, I think,
will be the better if I do not go.
Let me wish you a very happy
and most successful evening.
With kind personal wishes, I am
Faithfully yours,
JOHN G. BOWMAN.

First-Year Men,

Advisers Hold

initial Meetings

Freshmen Get Notices
Designating Place,
Time of Conferences

First meetings of faculty advisers
with new freshman students in the
College is scheduled for Monday aft-
ernoon at 12:30 o’clock, announces
Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel assist-
ant to the dean of the College.

This announcement does not per-
tain to freshman Women, who have
been meeting once a week with their
orientation teachers, Dr. Held states.

Letters have been sent to each
freshman, designating the place of his
meeting. Letters containing this in-
formation were also sent to their re-
spective advisors.

Any boy who has not received his
notice by Monday morning should go
to the office of the dean of the Col-
.lege, where the place of his particu-
lar meeting will be given to him.

The College is the only school in
the University that employes this
system of advisor and advisee, and,

according to Dr. Held, “Each advisor
‘can be of great assistance to the stu-
ident and to the College in assisting
gin getting as much information as
ipossible about his background.
 “The Kell.og company boasts that
fits product goes in at one end of the
jprocessing machinery and comes out
Ia finished product at the other end,
,untouched by human hands. This
Imay be a selling point for a break-
;fast food company but not for an
educational institution.”

By LOUISE B. MOYER,
fashion writer, Rosenbaum’s

So here we are again. Back at
our typewriter watching the camp-
us fashions go by. Fashions of
your own chosing for you set the
trends. We at Rosenbaum’s have
helped ‘wrestle with your clothes
problems. We CO1’?-SlCl(-El‘ you au-
thorities. Today we’re having our
ﬂing with campus fashions as
sound; as an encyclopedia
with prices geared to college al-
lowances. '

First let’s concentrate on the
Campus Triumvirate . . ._ the
jacket-sweater-skirt entente. The
sturdy plaid jacket or the ﬂannel
blazer. the soft, yummy sweaters
and the pleated or gored skirtsu
They go together like Olsen-‘
Johnson and Hellzapoppin. You’re
ﬁrm about these and so are we.
Both our College Shop and our
new Junior Sports Shop are pack-
ed to the rafters with variations
of all three. Comes now two new-
comers the long-sleeved
ﬂannel shirt in blazing colors and
the suede vest. You’ll need logar-
ithms to compute the number of
oiittits you can whip up S1l’1C8
tlie:-'e~ happened.

Alternative to the mix-ups is
the bright wool dress, notably the
slick new two-pieces is soft rab-
bits hair. There’s more to them
than meets the eye when you see
them on a hanger. Their skirts
flip out, their waists nip in, giving

you ii brand new ﬁgure. Wool-
gatlic-riiig is fun at Rosenbaunrsi
where prices start at a staggering,

low of $5.95 and go up but notlrecords we know_

very far up. They’ll brighten the!
corner where you are sitting in
l\/liss; l‘/IcKenna’s English I or II.

But. what goes on when
and it winter weather comes? A
doughty British Llama coat (nat-
ural. color) with a dark brown
lining. A turncoat! It goes into
1‘e'cc-rse and you wear it inside
out. Polly Pitt has a little Llama
that follows her to school, rain
or shine. The same reversible
sl-nci.:.":rviga11s go for Rosenbaum’s

Who is this Ann Sheridan?
"l‘ha‘..’s what we asked ourselves
when the Pitt Pollys selected for-
mal fashions for the show. Are
these the gals that trudge about
the campus in sweaters and skirts?
Comes Glamour toujours
Glamour! In a wicked black moire
evening skirt and a heavenly blue
satin evening blouse glittering
with jewelry, Polly Pitt will stag-
ger the stag line at the College
Association Thanksgiving Dance.
In her Victorian costume velvet,
her wide-skirted Velasquez “In-
fanta” gown or her long-sleeved
black crepe gown with back full-
ness. Polly Pitt the grind becomes
Polly Pitt the enchantress. Rosen-
baum’s specializes in such spell-
biiidcers at very minimum price
tags. '

Polly Pitt’s Private Life .
her home work, her relaxing at-
ter-hours, is prettier than ever
from a fashion viewpoint. On
chilly evenings nothing ever felt
so good nor looked so smart as a
snoozly chenchille robe or a col-
orful tiannel robe with guardsman
braid. The clever new flannelette
nighties and trick tuckstitch pa-
jamas add “oomph” to lounging
and are ﬁrm. foes of shivers run-
iiing, up the back.

Take a good long look at the
fashion show, listen closely to the
prices; and you’ll discover, if you
don’t know already, why Rosen-
baums is Polly Pitt’s Fashion
Store.

This year Rosenbaum.’s is send-
ing a bumper crop of furs to col-
lege. The importance of fur chub-
bies, slick for cardigans brings a
fur coat well within most college
allowances and both 0i

By F. WILIJAM BLAIR, JR.
fashion editor, R0senbaum’s

Let's get down to bras tacks
right on! You college men are one
of the toughest lots we know to
please! Do you keep us stepping!

You know fashions. You're one of i

the strongest forces in the field
with your uncanny influence. So in
‘his Peter and Polly Pitt Fashion
Parley, R,oscn?oaum’s has arranged
to give men on campus not what
we think is the thing to wear for
this occasion and that—but what
has been created, styled, designed
by men who understand college

life, its idiosyncrasies, and re-
quirements.

Take the 2-in-l coat for in-
stance. There’s an idea intro-
duced about 1O years ago with a
button—on lining. It wasn’t until
 college man bore the idea of a
zipper lining that it clicked. You
liked the barge shoe, the oxford
shirt, the wide brimmed felts and
wool socks — and they clicked.
You’re quick to discard what
doesn’t give you wear, comfort and
a feeling of well dressedness.
You’re quick to accept the prac-
tical, the comfortable and the un-
usual. So men, you see it’s not as
you thought at all——it’s a case of
our keeping up with you, not your
toeing the mark to our fashions---
they’re yours——-you set the pace
and we deliver the goods!

We’re proud as the dickens of
our clothing lines here at Rosen-
baum’s. You’ll see them all today.
For downright luxury, nothing
competes with Rogers Peet. It’s
the finest of ﬁne hand tailored
brands. Our Adler—Rochester and
Roseville lines are the results of
one of the most unique styling
Our Radcliffe,
Premier and Undergrad really
ring the bell for value. Rosen-

Duke Followers Willing to Settle for One

Touchdown Victory over Pitt Tomorrow

BlueDevils Reverse Previous System,’

Shift to Offensive Against Panthers;
McAfees, Lach, Killian Supply Punch

By Steve Lawrence,
__ Assistant Sports Editor, the Duke Chronicle
The blue-clad warriors who represent Duke university in the
football wars will invade the almost impregnable stronghold of the
Pitt _Panth'er tomorrow afternoon for the ﬁrst battle of the three game

series in the Smoky ‘City.

Twice a favored Panther team has invaded the South and both
resulting battles were gigantic, Pitt taking the 1937 contest 10-0,

with sophomore Dick Cassiano and:

junior Marshall Goldberg showing
the way. It was in that game that
Cassiano scored Pitt’s touchdown on
an 18-yard run that saw every Duke
man blocked off hisrfeet. «

Last fall another powerful Panther
team, a team powerful enough to
play almost intact against the New
York Giants in this year’s eastern
All-Star game, traveled South.

1939 Panthers Surprise .

PA taste of too much northern
weather and too much Tipton kick-
ing sent the Panther away frozen
out on the wrong end of a 7-0 score
which preserved Duke’s unblemished
record and set up a bid to the Rose
Bowl.

The 1939 Panther team was the
unknown X with the advent of a new
coach and the graduation of 10 ﬁrst-
team men, but two raging victories
of 26-6 over University of Washing-
ton and of 20-0 over West Virginia
have made Pitt appear an entirely
different team than ex-coach Jock
Sutherland once predicted it would
be, when he said Pitt would lose by
several touchdowns to the Iron
Dukes. A one-touchdown margin
would cause plenty of celebrating on
the part of Duke’s supporters.

The Blue Devils of 1939 are again
a team to be reckoned with, as Dav-
idson and Colgate will bear witness
to. In the season’s opener, an of-
fensive Duke team defeated little
Davidson by an expected 26-6 score,
but the result of Duke’s second con-
test with the Red Raiders of Colgate

in the Duke stadium was entirely
unprecedented.

In the broiling heat of a typically A

hot Durham Saturday afternoon, the
Dukes ran Andy Kerr’s invaders
ragged to the nth degree, while they
scored at ease on passes, runs, inter-
ceptions, laterals and placements to
completely smother Colgate 37-0,
which was more than a fourth of the
scoring done by Duke in 1938.

The 1939 Devils are minus the
nucleus of that great Iron Duke line
with Hill, Haas and Yorke missing,
but still boast stalwarts in Captain
“Sweet Pea” Johnston and Bolo Per-
due, whom most Pitt fans remember.
Behind the line Pitt won’t miss the
loss of Tipton, O’Mara and Spangler
but they wil ﬁnd the Dukes three
strong. in every position.

Duke Reserves Strong

In the backfield the Wes to George

McAfee passing, the plunging of
Roger Robinson and the blocking of
Jap Davis and Easy Eaves is worth
wat-ching. Frank ._ Killian, who ran
a 54-yard touchdown play against
Colgate is also a bad man to let
loose. , ,
P On the line the Dukes claim more
reserves than in 1938, and besides
Perdue and Johnson, boast a pass
snagger in end. Bill Bailey, a tal-
ented kicker in tackle Tony Ruﬁa, a
worthy successor to Dan Hill in Gor-
don Burns at center, and some hard
rushers in end Leonard Darnell,
tackle Alex Winterson, guards Frank
Ribar and Bob McDonough. Watch
these Dukes on Saturday. .

Tomorrow afternoon at the Stadium, the Golden Panthers of Pitt will

Officially Names Sterner

Cross-Country Captain

Olson’s Hill-and-Dalers Rated Heavy Favorites
In Opening Clash with Purdue Boilermakers
Over Schenley Park Trail Tomorrow Morning

According to official announcement from Frank Carver, director
of Pitt athletic publicity, VValt. Sterner, junior cross country star,

has been elevated to the captaincy

of the Pitt cross country team and

will lead the Blue and Gold thinclads in their opening clash with the
Purchie Boilermakers tomorrow morning.
Sterner, the outstanding cross country man in Pitt history, is in

the College and majors in sociology.¢

He is ﬁnishing his third year and will
graduate in the January class of
1941.

Zeke, as he has been christened by
his teammates, began his brilliant
collegiate career when he placed
fourth in the 1937 freshman ICAAAA
cross country championships. The
following spring, as a sophomore, he
cracked the University two-mile
mark. His record stood until Babe
Boulanger bettered- it last spring.

Sterner’s sophomore cross country
record is the best ever compiled by
a Pitt harrier. He met defeat but
once in dual competition, losing to
Willie Smith of Penn State, ICAAAA
champ.

He placed seventh in the ICAAAA
meet at Van Cortland Park in New
York where a hundred twenty-ﬁve
starters toed the starting line. Stern-
er also established a course record

Coach Mitchell expects to have a

Last Wednesday marked the be-

His chief opponent of tomorrow,

either Sterner, or Lew Manuwal or
Frank McCabe, other Panther satel-
lites.

The Independents, in their own in-

Wednesday . . . in a football fashion.
When ofﬁcials “Buck” Ohl and

it marked the opening of another
highly successful, large scale Pitt in-

The Little Panthers, in an un-
Pantherlike gesture, donated Bob
Johnson an.d company, better known
as the Newman Club, their ﬁrst Win
of the season. The Panthers neither
lacked ability or spirit—they just
didn’t show up. 

However, there was plenty of ac-
tion as the Metallurgists whacked at
light Chem Engineer Sophomore
team by a 12-6 score. Jimmy Mann
and Jack Pataky launched a success-
ful aerial offensive which gained the
Mets two touchdowns, both with Pat-
aky on the receiving and Mann on
the sending end respectively.

Mann, who was the captain of the
_all—stars hasn’t lost a bit of his foot-
iball prowess. Six of his passes
clicked for long gains. Pataky, _a
protege of “Doc” Carlson, had glue
on his ﬁngers, and was responsible
for the two touchdowns, scoring a
third which was called back.

University Stages Eighth Annual
Track, Field Meet This Week

In spite of the fact that a fall

football and cross country tang wlil

likely be predominating in the Pittsburgh air, Wednesday and Thursday,
October 19 and 20, the Pitt athletic department will stage its eighth annual

Fall Track and Field Meet at the Pitt

stadium.

All would-be runners and jumpers who have hitherto shown great pro-
ﬁciency in games of “cops and robbers” and “hop-skotch” are urged to ﬁle

entries.
munity picnic dash champions and
carnival prize winners in feats of-
strength have excellent chances to
demonstrate their prowess in run-
ning and weight-throwing, respec-
tively.

The athletic department states that

4 this meet is held for the purpose of

discovering track and ﬁeld men of
collegiate competitive stature among
untried athletes, who have yet to
win freshman numerals or varsity
letters in cross-country or track and
ﬁeld at the University.

In past years this meet has been
an excellent testing laboratory for
examining possibilities -of innate
track ability heretofore‘ unrevealed
to the coaches’ eye. High school
track, reputations have meant little
in the collegiate realm in former
seasons, many‘, great Pitt trackmen
having worn their ﬁrst pair of track
shoes at Pitt. A

vations at next week’s meeting.

“Already this year some commit-
tees are showing the ﬁrst signs of not
meeting their responsibilities,” Cu-
isick declared. “Let me say that we

hind us; if we fail it will be the fault
of no one outside of our organiza-
l tion.”

However, the SFA president laud-
ed most of the committee for “al-
ready doing fine work——some against
great odds.”

Chairmen of committees were in-

vited to appear before the executive
committee at any time to discuss
plans and the personnel of their re-
spective committees.
; Enclosed with the letter the SFA
 committeemen and members received
?a revised list of the organization’s

Reveal Inside

Story of Demonstrations Block

By Edith Rosenblatt

“Everybody sitting on white, turn
blue to the field. All others show
gold.” With this terse command
from the head cheerleader,‘ an ani-
mated demonstration takes place at
the stadium on football days. But
there is more to the demonstration
block than shows on the surface.

Tom Halloran C40, and Adele
Yorio, Ed41, tell us that ﬁrst all the

movements of the demonstration are
drawn up on graph paper with each
block representing a person. It is
then necessary before every game for
the demonstration block committee
to put identification symbols in the
form of colored tacks on the rows
"and rows of seats which make up
the block. With one tack necessary
for each formation, nine hundred
people in the block, and four or five
formations at each game, the com-
mittee has plenty to do.

Members Wear Capes

At 1:45 o’clock, when the crowds
start to pour into the stadium, the
demonstration block participants
find their places because of the large
black letters held up by the section
leader. _ 1

Each person in the block is given;
a cape, blue on one side and gold:

A
Rehearsals were held the first two

years, but last year the block was
successful without rehearsing. This,
the fourth year, Tom Halloran and
Adele. Yorio, with their committee
composed of thirty section leaders
and six members of SFA, secured a
record registration, partly through
installation of booths on the ground
floor for the first time.

Dr. BaI.d—w-i_n— Will Speak
Before Inquiry Monday

Dr. Leland D. Baldwin, lecturer in
history and editor of the University
Press, will speak Monday in the In-

quiry Forum sponsored by the
YMCA.
Dr. Baldwin recently returned

from war-torn Europe, will speak on
“Impressions of Europe on the Eve
of the War.”

The forum will be conducted in
132 Cathedral at 12:30 o’clock.

History Group to Hold
Open House Monday

Phi Alpha Theta, national honor-
ary history fraternity, will hold open
house at Heinz House Monday eve-
ning at 7:45 o’clock.

Dr. Andrew N. Cleven, professor

on the other. When the demonstra-  of history, D1; Leland D_ Bamwjn,

tion is to begin, either the chairmen g
of the block or the cheerleaders di-'

rect the block through its own pub-
lic addresssystem. — -

The demonstration block idea or-'

iginated on the west coast. The boys
and girls wore white for background
and held up cards, but here the

. weather does not permit that set up,

and so capes are used.
Bearer First Head -

Louis Bearer was the first dem-
onstration block chairman, four years
ago. About seven hundred people
took part in the first demonstration.
The second year, William MacKenna
and D. C. Schultz were in charge.

They enlarged the block to nine hun- ,

dred and worked out more forma-
tions. Last year Edwin Ellis and-
Patsy Griffith C40 headed the block.

Pitt Band Name Contest
Will End This Afternoon
All entries for the “Name the Pitt

Swing Band” contest must be depos-
ited in the ground boor ballot box to- 

day, according to to James Hunter, 

BA42, who says that the contest will
close at 3:30 o’clock.

Prizes for naming the swing band
will be two tickets to the Stanley
theater, secured through the court-
esy, of Max Adkins, director of the
new Stanley “Sweet and Swing”
band. Gerry Abels, C40, warns all
contestants to be sure that all entries
are accompanied by the name, school,
and year of the person submitting the
name.

Excerpts from 1915 News
Show Lukewarm Attitude

This is the second of 0', series in which the road to war  traced as

reﬂected in the Pitt Weekly of 1914-1918.

The Weekly was the fo'rermLne1'

of the News and the present series will attempt to present student attitudes

as they existed during the period th.

at led to the ﬁrst worlcl war.

By Dorothy Cleland
’l‘l1cre \\‘as no more intense ‘feeliiigr about the war at the l,7nivcr-
sEt._‘v' when classes rt-‘sinned for the new _\'ear of 1915 than there had

been before Christmas Vacation.

The editors of The Pitt \\"cel~:l_v wrote an editorial cl:i.r{ling- in.-

‘.\‘il‘lZl.C°,I§01‘S who were lcccping classes overtime so that the students
The_\' demanded that the instructors
(>I,'~.“-I€‘l"V'€‘. the same rules of punctu-9

xw-r'c late for the next hour.

al.ii._y which the)’ dcsix'e(l their stu-
(lcnts to observe.

On January 29, C. F. Lemke spoke
before the Deutscher Verein, a Ger-
man club, on war news. He said
that most of the news came through
British sources and our newspapers
were controlled by capitalists.
Chancellor Speaks

Clnancellor McCormick discussed
“War and Education”\at an assembly
of students on February 5.. He stated
‘(.111-it attendance at English univer-
sities and colleges was 40 per cent
below normal and lower than that
in Germany and France. Even at
this late date, if the Chancellor’s
speech is indicative of general Uni-
versity opinion, no one thought the
United States would be drawn into
the war. What most persons were
concerned about was how the war
would affect the ﬁnancial conditions
in our country. This is the question
which the Chancellor raised at the
assembly. He said that the war would
bring the Americas closer.

He also said, “Bad as is the war,
zinc}. horrible as it is in its work of
cle;:';1;i'uction, it is accomplishing, per-
haps, many good things; and our
hope is that if it shall result in the
final elimination of war, it will even
justify itself in its ultimate outcome.”

Ironic note in this period is an
editorial in answer to a letter from a
student who was aghast at the idea
of the paper printing the picture of a
Socialist who was to speak to the
Socialist club at the University. The
<2di’I;orial stated that what was needed
was tolerance toward all groups, no
matter where one‘s own sympathies
m.i_»;*ht lie.

Student Meeting

«On February 26, the first real real-
ization of the war was voiced in the
1.:ra,:>ci' when delegates from the Uni-
ve7r*:aity, Carnegie Tech, Columbia,
and other colleges and universities
gathered at Carnegie Hall to protest
the militarization of the world. The
delegates feared that the United
States might become an armed na-
tion. They were, they said, ﬁghting a
war against war and against in-
C"i"é?I-;l.S€Cl armaments.

Eiliortly after this, Hamilton Holt,
erltlor of The New York Independent
spruilring before students on the war
and a possible peace movement, ad-
vocatccl the establishment of a peace
in :1‘./ement by the neutral powers, in-
:_-ligxding the United States.

Lusitania Sinking

On May 7, the United States was
,shocked out of its lethargy by the
Esinking of the Lusitania which was

[carrying a large number of American V
icitizens. The attitude at the Univer—‘

Isity was not at first one of revenge,
Iit was rather an .attitude of “Let’s
Inot talk about it.”

The Pitt Weekly editorial on the
Idisaster said in part, “We dare say
Ithat there is not an American citizen
I,so calloused that emotions of pity
{and indignation have not surged in
Ihis breast during the past week, but
lit is no time to give vent to such

Governor Hints
Report Affects
Appropriation

University Officials
Make No Comment
On Newspaper Article

In a special article under his own
byline, Robert Taylor, staﬁ writer
for the Pittsburgh Press at Harris-
burg, reported last Wednesday that
Govenor Arthur H. James had hinted
that the current controversy over
the trustee investigating committee’s
report might affect the University’s
appropriation.

Since publication of a story under
a byline indicates that the ideas ex-
pressed are the writer’s own, noth-
ing in this article could be constru-
ed as having ofﬁcial conﬁrmation.

Taylor’s report indicated that dur-
ing a press conference Governor
James was asked whether he had re-
ceived a copy of the University
Trustees report. As an ex-ofﬁcio
member of the Board of Trustees,
the governor was entitled to receive
the report.

Stating that he had never heard of

the report, and uncertain as to
whether he had received a notice of
the special meeting held last month,
‘Governor James pointed out that his
fadministration “was interested in
‘the management of institutions to see
that they are managed as econom-
,ically as possible.
I “It might have a great effect on
whether the appropriations made by
the state are to be increased or de-
creased,” Tay1or’s quotation of the
Governor continued.

University officials when question-
ed. by The News made no comment
on the matter.

Dr. Hambro Analyzes Reactions
Of Scandinavian Countries to War

By Jack Brady

“Beware of the Greeks when they
come bearing gifts,” is the method by
which Dr. Edward I-lambro, head of
the section for International Relations
at the Michelsen Institute, Bergen,
Norway, analyzed the reaction of the
Scandinavian group toward advances
by Britain and France.

Speaking in Foster l\/Iemorial at a
special assembly last Wednesday, Dr.
Hambro pointed out that Scandina-
via refuses to take part in any alli-
ances because of “the proven unsta-
blenessi of alliances.”

For Cooperation

“This belief,” he also pointed out,
“governed our refusal to accept the
oﬁers of France, Great Britain and
Soviet Russia in a guarantee of tar-
ritorial integrity and has aided us in
maintaining strict neutrality.”

“In the present conflict,” he said,
“we wish to continue to trade with
the governments of both Denmark
and Norway to provide for some
methods of international arbitration
and “our people are imbued with
spirit of internationalism and coop-
eration,” he explained.

“In regard to our participation in

Receive Speech
Group Positions

Two University representatives
were named as leaders of the newly-
organized Pennsylvania Speech As-
sociation, meeting in Harrisburg last
week.

C. Stanton Belfour, assistant direc-
tor of the University extension divi— ,
sion, and Charles W. Lomas, instruc- I
tor in speech, were elected as exec-
utive secretary and chairman of theI
high school debate committee, re—I
spectively. I

“To provide a common organiza-I
tion for the uniﬁcation of aims of all I
teachers, administers, or others in
the state who may be interested in
speech,” the association met at the
state capitol to formally organize
last week. In addition to Mr. Bel-
four and Mr. Lomas, the University
was represented by Roy H. Umble,
instructor in speech, and Buell B.
Whitehill, assistant professor of
speech.

Coincident with the Speech ‘Asso_-
ciation meeting, the Debate Associa-
tion of Pennsylvania Colleges held a

versity was admitted into the Asso-

ciation of 32 Pennsylvania schools.
Three questions for state debatei
were recommended and discussed:I
(1) Blame for war rests upon Al-I
lies; (2) U. S. government shouldI

ment should stop anti-American ac-
tivities.

the League of Nations, the people
liked the idea but they feared the
possibility of losing their neutrality
and this was the problem we have to
face at the beginning of the post-war
period, still we decided to join the
league,” asserted Dr. Hambro.
League Cooperation

“We thought it cowardly to stay
away from the League of Nations and
although the League of today is not
what it should be, the only way to
improve it is to become a member
and cooperate,” he declared.

Immediately after the invasion of
Ethiopia by Italy and when Scandi-
navia saw that the economic sanc-
tions against Italy were not being
fulﬁlled by some of the members, the
group met to discuss the plans to be
followed during the next war and a
mutual declaration was made on May
27, 1938.

Explaining the feeling of solidarity
among the Scandinavian nations, he
said that the military budget of the
individual countries has been in-
creased and each of them feels that
it has been strengthened if only one
ship is added to the navy of one of
their “brother” countries.

Favored 14 Points

After the World War public opin-
ion in the Scandinavian countries
favored the plans advocated by Pres-
ident Wilson, especially the plan for
a league of nations, he said.

Resolutions have been passed by
both groups and if defense of our
neutrality policy is necessary, we are
ready.”

“Now the League is no longer uni-

versal,” he said, “because Germany,,
Italy, and Japan are deﬁnitely op-I
posed to the basic rules of it and the

League has developed to be one com-
posed of countries disagreeing with
the principles of other great powers.”

Increased feeling is apparent among
other nations that the great powers.
still members of the League, do not
wish to fight for ideals, principles and
international law, but they wish to
light to defend the staus quo in the
world, and to keep their own power
and maintain their own position in
the world, he explained.

“But Scandinavia,” he said in clos-
ing, “believes that she has contributed
something to the world by her spe-
cial brand of political and interna-
tional cooperation developed in the
group and hopes that it will set a
good example for other countries.”

JOE WILLIAMS

FAMOUS SPORTS EXPERT

LONG-BURNING SMOKES have a big appeal for Joe Williams, as well as for
many another cigarette smoker. Joe, whose keen comments on sports are eagerly
read by millions of fans, is equally “in the know” on cigarettes too. He says: “Every
Camel gives me an extra period of cigarette enjoyment—a longer smoke, and a
milder, cooler, ‘mellower smoke! Naturally, such a cigarette has a more appeal-
ing taste. Yes, sir,” Joe concludes, “it’s a real thrill to smoke a Camel.” You, too,
will ﬁnd that Camel’s long-burning, costlier tobaccos do give more pleasure per
puﬂ'—AND——-more puffs per pack. That’s pleasure plus economy—a shrewd buy.
No wonder America’s smokers have made Camels their cigarette choice No. 1.

Notes on the Panther’s air-crusade%
to the far West . . The planes ran

finished polishing off a very large
meal and in less time than it takes
to tell about it, their stomachs were
doing ﬂip-flops. Iron—man Cassiano
and Bobby Hoel, assistant coach, were
the first to be affected and they al-
most “croaked,” which made the
other boys feel that they were pretty
Iuggecl. Later on they also felt at
sea.

The movie talent scouts were
lined up three-deep, waiting‘ for the
Panthers in California. They all
smiled when they saw Ben Kish
but they laughed out loud when
they got a gander at Butch Klein

. . It’s mutiny, girls, but the boys
claim that when they saw the Uni-
versity of Washington co-eds that
were provided for them as dates in
the evening after the game, they

wanted to linger longer . . much
longer.

Heart Breakers

They broke many hearts there, but
many hearts were broken on their
side in return . . Emil Narick will
be a long time forgetting the dream
he escorted.

They still claim that Fullback
Bonelli has two hollow legs where he
slows away food. Coach Bowser re-
ports that Ernie won the food-con-
suming contest hands down, while
the other fellows on the team were
too amazed to comment . . It"s ru-
mored that at each meal he ate more ;
than Joe Cambal and Ted Konetsky
together, which is really something.

i has a flying start.

Fourth H clping

Whimpy Fullerton tried to keep
pace with Bonelli but it was no
dice. Wimpy reached a point
where he could chew but he
couldn’t swallow while Ernie was
just getting warmed upafter his
fourth extra helping Also,
since that. victory party Saturday
night after the game, Steve Sinco,
husky center, changed from a. silent
Sam into the most loquacious mem-
ber of the squad. He is willing to
sing a song or make a speech at a
minute’s notice now.

Frank Goodell, Art Corace, Paul
Foley, Rudy Gradisek, and Edgar
Jones are trying to get Athletic Di-
rector James Hagan to schedule an-
other game with Washington out
there this season. The boys like that
Western hospitality.

Highlights of the trip for the boys
. . kissing the lovely hostesses
good-bye after the planes landed back
at the County airport. _ Rettinger,

Dickinson, and Murphy were faster

than the other fellows and got in

line twice.

ﬁrst woman of the day is a little

Mary Lou is a Senior l\/lentor, a

Headlining our hit parade as the
first man of the day is “Dandy
_Dick” Cassiano, prize of the Phi
Kappa fra.ternit.y. Besides being
, president of ODK and a. straight-A
student, he is also one of the na-
tion’s best football players. That
sporty wrist watch he wears is the
Wcttach Award, won in his Fresh-
man year. His attitude in class
leads many to believe that he is
the quiet, studious type, but those
that know him best claim that he
is the life of any party. Dick is
listed in our books as an All-
American athlete and student .
and is a real fellow. Incidentally
girls, he is foot-loose and fancy-
free.

“YOKEL BOY’S” GIRLFRIEND‘:

(Of Monda_v’s P. A.) I wouldn't worry
too much. Football season is here. So try
falling in love with Cassiano or one of the
boys. They, too, are far, far, far away
and Monday morning; brings its disillu-
sionment when you see them with some
one else. But try it nevertheless. It will
make you appreciate the boy who sits
next to you in history class. BK. (The
